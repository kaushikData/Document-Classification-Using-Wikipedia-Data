'''''A Smile as Big as the Moon''''' is a [[Hallmark Hall of Fame]] television movie. The film debuted on [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] on January 29, 2012.&lt;ref name="smart"/&gt;

[[John Corbett (actor)|John Corbett]] stars in this film based on the 2002 memoir of the same title by teacher Mike Kersjes and Joe Layden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lccn.loc.gov/2001048779 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120709192342/http://lccn.loc.gov/2001048779 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=July 9, 2012 |title=A Smile as Big as the Moon |publisher=Library of Congress |work=Library of Congress Online Catalog |accessdate=February 2, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The movie shows the challenges Kersjes faced as he worked to bring out the best from his [[special education]] students by taking them to [[United States Space Camp|Space Camp]], which had, until that time been perceived as a program best suited to advanced science and math students, well beyond the reach of special education students.   Several actors playing students in the film have [[Down syndrome]], [[autism]] and/or [[learning disability|learning disabilities]].&lt;ref name="smart"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://gettingsmart.com/news/a-smile-as-big-as-the-moon-airs-abc-tonight-9-pm-est/ | title=‘A Smile As Big As the Moon’ Airs ABC January 29th | date=January 8, 2012 | accessdate=February 2, 2012 | author=Cargill, Sarah}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
Ben, a student with Down syndrome, in Mike Kersjes's [[Forest Hills Northern High School]], [[Grand Rapids, Michigan]], special education class, dreams of becoming an [[astronaut]]. Kersjes, who is also a [[American football|football]] coach is inspired to pursue Space Camp for his students.  Obstacles mount as school administrators object to the expense and Space Camp officials have no experience with special-ed students.  Teacher Robynn McKinney supports Kersjes's efforts.&lt;ref name="smart"/&gt;

Eventually the trip is approved by the necessary parties, and Kersjes faces another set of challenges: fundraising, preparing the students for their trip with science and physical education, and battling bullying and belittling from other students.  Kersjes engages the football team in these endeavors.&lt;ref name="smart"/&gt;

==Filming==
The film was shot primarily in [[Wilmington, North Carolina]] and at [[United States Space Camp]] in [[Huntsville, Alabama]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mlive.com/tv/index.ssf/2012/01/a_smile_as_big_as_the_moon_sta.html&lt;/ref&gt; One scene used Sky Theater inside [[Ingram Planetarium]] of [[Sunset Beach, North Carolina]], which was adapted to appear as a [[planetarium]] would have in 1988. Filming took place there September 28, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.myrtlebeachonline.com/2012/01/22/2617313/nc-planetarium-has-starring-role.html |title=N.C. planetarium has starring role in upcoming TV movie |last=Palisin |first=Steve |work=[[The Sun News]] |date=2012-01-22 |accessdate=2012-01-25 }}{{dead link|date=June 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Allen Hershkowitz''' is an American [[environmental scientist]] who worked as a senior scientist at [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] from 1988 to 2014 and then at the Green Sports Alliance.

== Career ==
Hershkowitz started working at the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] (NRDC) around 1988.&lt;ref name=Guardian&gt;{{cite news|last1=Pratt|first1=Timothy|title=NHL fights global warming by going carbon neutral|url=https://www.theguardian.com/sustainable-business/2014/dec/18/nhl-global-warming-carbon-neutral-in-a-bid-to|work=The Guardian|date=18 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the [[Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences]] approached the NRDC for advice about how to reduce the [[carbon footprint]] of the Oscar Awards show, after the academy was asked to do so by one of the producers of ''[[An Inconvenient Truth]]''.  Hershkowitz, in his role as a senior scientist at the NRDC, helped them from 2007 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Carpenter|first1=Susan|title=Stepping out on the recycled red carpet|url=http://latimesblogs.latimes.com/greenspace/2011/02/stepping-out-onto-the-100-post-consumer-waste-recycled-red-carpet.html|work=LA Times Blogs - Greenspace|date=4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, [[The Recording Academy]] asked the NRDC for help [[greening]] the Grammy Awards starting in 2008, and Hershkowitz led that effort as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Green Grammys Honor Great Music With Smaller Carbon Footprint|url=http://www.ens-newswire.com/ens/feb2008/2008-02-11-097.html|work=Environmental News Service|date=February 11, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;


At an NRDC staff retreat in 2004, board member [[Robert Redford]] suggested that the NRDC establish more of a presence at professional sporting events; Hershkowitz told a reporter from ''Mother Jones'': "We were trying to figure out how to reach out to untraditional allies, and Redford says to us, 'You know, if you want to meet Americans, you’ve got to go to a baseball game or a football game. You’ve got to go to one of these stadiums. That’s where America is.'"&lt;ref name=MJ2011&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gordon|first1=Ian|title=Can Stadium Sports Really Be Green?|url=https://www.motherjones.com/environment/2011/10/green-sports-stadiums-baseball-giants/|work=Mother Jones|date=October 24, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Hershkowitz met with [[Bud Selig]] of the [[Major League Baseball]] (MLB) shortly after that, and soon the NRDC was creating white papers and teams to advise all the major sports leagues about environmental sustainability initiatives that addressed each sport's needs and could help them save money.&lt;ref name=MJ2011/&gt;  Hershkowitz eventually ran the Sports Greening Initiative at the NRDC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Belson|first1=Ken|title=Sports Industry Expands Its Environmental Initiatives|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/10/26/business/sports-industry-expands-its-environmental-initiatives.html|work=The New York Times|date=25 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The Green Sports Alliance got started in the late 2000s as informal discussions among management of sports teams in the Pacific Northwest, about how to improve their operations' sustainability.&lt;ref name=MJ2011/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Steinbach|first1=Paul|title=Conservation is King at Seattle's Safeco Field - Athletic Business|url=http://www.athleticbusiness.com/Stadium-Arena/conservation-is-king-at-seattle-s-safeco-field.html|work=Athletic Business|date=September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea of formalizing an alliance was generated in a meeting between Hershkowitz and representatives of sports teams owned by [[Paul Allen]] via [[Vulcan Inc.]], and GSA formally launched in the spring of 2011, with NDRC as one of the founding organizations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=O'Brien|first1=Luke|title=Green Sports Alliance: Go Green Or Go Home|url=https://www.fastcompany.com/1768522/green-sports-alliance-go-green-or-go-home|work=Fast Company|date=8 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2014 Hershkowitz left the NRDC and became president of the GSA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Press release: Green Sports Alliance Ushers in New Era of Influence|url=http://greensportsalliance.org/green-sports-alliance-ushers-new-era-influence/|publisher=Green Sports Alliance|date=24 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2015, Hershkowitz was listed as the 50th most influential person in the field of [[Sport management|sports business]] by the ''[[Sports Business Daily]]'', which was the first time he had been on the list.  By the time of the listing, he had provided environmental sustainability advice to the [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], the [[National Hockey League|NHL]], [[Major League Baseball|MLB]], [[Major League Soccer]], and the [[U.S. Tennis Association]] that, according to the listing, had saved the leagues millions of dollars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=50 Most Influential: No. 50 — Allen Hershkowitz|url=http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2015/12/07/Most-Influential/50.aspx|work=Sports Business Daily|date=December 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Belson|first1=Ken|title=A Future for the Used-Up Tools of the Tennis Trade|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/09/03/sports/tennis/a-future-for-the-used-up-tools-of-the-tennis-trade.html|work=The New York Times|date=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guardian/&gt;

In December 2015, the GSA under Hershkowitz's leadership helped organize two summits on sports sustainability at the [[2015 United Nations Climate Change Conference]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blaustein|first1=Lew|title=The Paris Tragedy, COP21 and the Sustainable Innovation in Sport Symposium|url=https://greensportsblog.com/2015/11/20/the-paris-tragedy-cop21-and-the-sustainable-innovation-in-sport-symposium/|website=GreenSportsBlog|accessdate=20 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The participation of representatives from major American professional sports associations marked the first time the sports industry were directly involved with climate change initiatives by the United Nations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Nelson|first1=Adam|title=Sustainable Innovation in Sport: leading the line in the battle against climate change|url=http://www.sportspromedia.com/magazine_features/sustainable_innovation_in_sport|website=SportsPro|publisher=SportsPro Media Limited|accessdate=14 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2016 Hershkowitz left the GSA to focus on more global issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Press release: Green Sports Alliance President Allen Hershkowitz Departs to Pursue Global Green Sports Work -|url=http://greensportsalliance.org/green-sports-alliance-president-allen-hershkowitz-departs-to-pursue-global-green-sports-work/|work=Green Sports Alliance|date=22 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2016 Sports and Sustainability International was formally launched; Hershkowitz was a member of its organizing committee, along with four other founding directors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Green-Sports Experts Launch “Sport and Sustainability International”|url=https://greensportsblog.com/2016/12/15/green-sports-experts-launch-sport-and-sustainability-international/|work=GreenSportsBlog|date=15 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard of Clairvaux]]'s '''''Apologia ad Guillelmum''''' was written in 1125 at the ostensible request of his friend and fellow monastic reformer, [[William of St-Thierry|William of Saint-Thierry]], and is the key document in the early twelfth century controversy over art, the greatest controversy over art to occur in the West previous to the [[Protestant Reformation|Reformation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Things-Greater-Importance-Clairvauxs-Apologia/dp/0812281810|title=The "Things of Greater Importance": Bernard of Clairvaux's Apologia and the Medieval Attitude Toward Art|last=Rudolph|first=Conrad|date=1990-07-01|publisher=Univ of Pennsylvania Pr|isbn=9780812281811|edition=First|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Already in the [[Early Christianity|Early Christian period]], there was disagreement within the Church as to the appropriateness of [[Catholic Church art|religious art]].  While the use of religious art gradually came to be accepted by the mainstream, its rejection within certain limits remained a constant throughout the Middle Ages.  In the twelfth century, certain elements within reform monasticism (especially the [[Cistercians]] but also others) saw the use of art by monks as inappropriate for a number of reasons.  Criticism of the use of monastic art was seen as a criticism of the greatest patrons of religious art of the time, traditional [[Order of Saint Benedict|Benedictine]] monasticism (virtually all of the greatest medieval art up until this time had been religious).  Since traditional Benedictine monasticism was one of the richest and most influential segments of society—and since art was one of the great vehicles of interaction between traditional monasticism and the lay public, this interaction being an important source of wealth for monasticism—the controversy over art that arose involved far more than aesthetic questions.

The ''Apologia'' is the most articulate document we have for this controversy and one of the most important in understanding how medieval art was used and perceived.  In it, Bernard takes up five major criticisms of the use of monastic art.

== Art to attract donations ==

=== The monastic investment ===
Perhaps Bernard's harshest criticism of the monastic use of art addresses the economic base of monastic art production: the monastic investment in art for the purpose of attracting donations from the visiting public. In doing so, he takes up a number of different themes such as the justification of investing in art, art for the honor of God, the relation between material and spiritual prosperity, and the financial necessity of pilgrimage art.

=== The liturgical artwork ===
[[File:Master Of Saint Gilles - The Mass of St Gilles - WGA14485.jpg|thumb|''The Mass of Saint Giles'', by the [[Master of Saint Giles]], c. 1500 (National Gallery, London)]]
In discussing the artistic means by which the investment in art was carried out, Bernard particularly criticizes excess in art, focusing especially on excess in material, craftsmanship, size, and quantity.  In this criticism, what he most objects to is not monumental sculpture and painting but rather liturgical art, that is, works often of gold, silver, and jewels that were used in the liturgy and often in the Cult of Relics.

=== The equation between excessive art and holiness ===
In his critique of the reception of art on the part of the general public, Bernard took up the indispensable element of medieval pilgrimage art: the equation between excessive art and holiness, that is, the use of excessive art in order to create a sense of ''praesentia'' (the physical presence of the holy).

=== Art in opposition to the care of the poor ===
Following in the patristic tradition, Bernard also sees art as in opposition to the care of the poor, his most significant social objection external to monasticism properly speaking.

=== Art as a spiritual distraction to the monk ===
One of Bernard's most important criticisms of the monastic use of art is that of art as a spiritual distraction to the monk.  Aside from simple distraction, this criticism includes such dangers to the medieval monk as curiosity and materiality.

=== To Whom the Apologia Was Addressed ===
While the traditional view has been that the ''Apologia'' was directed at the art of the monastery of [[Cluny Abbey|Cluny]] in particular and that of other offending Cluniac and traditional Benedictine monasteries in general, more recent scholarship has shown that the ''Apologia'' was instead directed at not only all of traditional monasticism but also marginal traditional Benedictine monasteries, the new ascetic orders ([[Carthusians]], [[Gilbertine Order|Gilbertines]], [[Premonstratensians]], and so on), and Bernard's own [[Cistercians|Cistercian Order]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rudolph|first=Conrad|date=1988-01-01|title=Bernard of Clairvaux's Apologia as a Description of Cluny, and the Controversy over Monastic Art|url=http://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.2307/767000|journal=Gesta|volume=27|issue=1/2|pages=125–132|doi=10.2307/767000|issn=0016-920X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|text=the [[Senary#Base_36_as_senary_compression|base 36 compression method for senary counting]]}}

'''Base36''' is a [[binary-to-text encoding]] scheme that represents [[binary data]] in an [[ASCII]] string format by translating it into a [[radix]]-36 representation. The choice of 36 is convenient in that the digits can be represented using the [[Hindu–Arabic numerals|Arabic numerals]] 0–9 and the [[Latin alphabet|Latin letters]] A–Z&lt;ref name=HopeWalther&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt; (the [[ISO basic Latin alphabet]]).

Each base36 digit needs less than 6 bits of information to be represented.

== Conversion ==

Signed 32- and 64-bit integers will only hold at most 6 or 13 base-36 digits, respectively (that many base-36 digits overflow the 32- and 64-bit integers). For example, the 64-bit signed integer maximum value of "[[9223372036854775807]]" is "&lt;tt&gt;1Y2P0IJ32E8E7&lt;/tt&gt;" in base-36.
For example, the 32-bit signed integer maximum value of "[[2147483647]]" is "&lt;tt&gt;ZIK0ZJ&lt;/tt&gt;" in base-36.

=== Standard implementations  ===
[[Java SE]] supports conversion from/to String to different bases from 2 up to 36.  For example, [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/lang/Character.html#digit-char-int-] and [https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/math/BigInteger.html#BigInteger-java.lang.String-int-]

Just like Java, [[JavaScript]] also supports conversion from/to String to different bases from 2 up to 36. [https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Reference/Global_Objects/Number/toString]

PHP, like Java, supports conversion from/to String to different bases from 2 up to 36. Use the [https://secure.php.net/manual/en/function.base-convert.php base_convert] function, available since PHP 4.

=== C implementation ===
&lt;source lang="C"&gt;
static char *base36enc(long unsigned int value)
{
	char base36[36] = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ";
	/* log(2**64) / log(36) = 12.38 =&gt; max 13 char + '\0' */
	char buffer[14];
	unsigned int offset = sizeof(buffer);

	buffer[--offset] = '\0';
	do {
		buffer[--offset] = base36[value % 36];
	} while (value /= 36);

	return strdup(&amp;buffer[offset]); // warning: this must be free-d by the user
}

static long unsigned int base36dec(const char *text)
{
	return strtoul(text, NULL, 36);
}
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Python implementation === 
Python Code to encode BASE36 from BASE10&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2TechUp|website=2TechUp}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;source lang="python" line="1" start="0"&gt;
def base36encode(integer):
    chars = '0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ'
    
    sign = '-' if integer &lt; 0 else ''
    integer = abs(integer)
    result=''
    
    while integer &gt; 0:
        integer, remainder = divmod(integer, 36)
        result =chars[remainder]+result

    return sign+result  #appending sign to the obtained result
&lt;/source&gt;

=== Visual Basic .NET implementation ===
&lt;source lang="vb"&gt;
Public Function ToBase36String(i as UInteger) As String
    Const rainbow = "0123456789ABCDEFGHIJKLMNOPQRSTUVWXYZ"
    Dim sb = New StringBuilder()
    Do
        sb.Insert(0, rainbow(i Mod 36))
        i /= 36
    Loop While i &lt;&gt; 0
    Return sb.ToString()
End Function
&lt;/source&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4708">'''CALERIE''' ('''Comprehensive Assessment of Long-term Effects of Reducing Intake of Energy''') is a trial currently underway in the U.S. to study the effects of prolonged [[calorie restriction]] on healthy human subjects. 

The CALERIE study is being carried out at the [[Pennington Biomedical Research Center]] (Baton Rouge, Louisiana), the Jean Mayer USDA Human Nutrition Research Center on Aging at [[Tufts University]] (Boston, Massachusetts) and the [[Washington University in St. Louis|Washington University]] School of Medicine (St. Louis, Missouri).&lt;ref&gt;[http://calerie.dcri.duke.edu/about/index.html About CALERIE], retrieved 12 October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;  It is hoped that caloric restriction reduces the incidence of [[cardiovascular disease]] and [[cancer]] and leads to a longer life, as has been demonstrated previously in numerous animal studies.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{Cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; CALERIE is the first study to investigate prolonged calorie restriction in healthy humans, which is practiced and advocated for by the members of the [[Calorie Restriction Society]]. Study subjects are selected from people who are not obese (because calorie restriction on obese people is already known to lengthen life, but possibly for different reasons).&lt;ref name=economist/&gt;

A smaller predecessor study ended in 2006. Forty-eight subjects were randomly assigned to a control group and a treatment group; those in the treatment group were put on a 25% calorie reduction over a 6-month period. It was found that the treatment group had lower [[insulin resistance]], lower levels of [[LDL cholesterol]], lower body temperature and blood-insulin levels as well as less oxidative damage to their DNA.&lt;ref name=economist&gt;[http://www.economist.com/sciencetechnology/displaystory.cfm?story_id=6823498 Eat less, live more], ''The Economist'', April 22, 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

The second, larger, phase of CALERIE began in 2007. The participants are subjected to a 25% calorie restriction over a 2-year period, and several physiological variables are regularly monitored. Participants are paid [[US$]]5,000 at Tufts and Pennington and $2,400 at Washington University. As of October 2009 the study had 132 participants and was still accepting new ones.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

Study subjects have to be highly motivated and organized enough to keep a detailed journal of all foods they eat. Their daily baseline calorie requirements are precisely determined before the trial: in a two-week laboratory test the rate of [[carbon dioxide]] production is measured, allowing to compute the number of burned calories. The subjects are then taught a diet of low-energy density foods, such as vegetables, fruits (especially apples), [[dietary fiber|insoluble fiber]] and soups. Most subjects reported that they felt hungry for the first few weeks, after which they adjusted to the new diet. Complaints focused on the rigid bookkeeping scheme imposed on them.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

That calorie restriction (CR) might lengthen human lifespan was suggested by various studies on laboratory animals. However, when the studies were extended to long-lived [[primates]] ([[rhesus monkeys]]), while it was indeed found in a 2012 study by the US [[National Institute on Aging]] (NIA) that CR had benefits to immune function, motor coordination, and resistance to sarcopenia, a CR regimen implemented in rhesus monkeys of various ages did not improve survival outcomes. The authors considered that the study suggested "a separation between health effects, morbidity and mortality", and that "study design, husbandry and diet composition may strongly affect the life-prolonging effect of CR in a long-lived non-human primate".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mattison|first1=Julie A.|last2=Roth|first2=George S.|last3=Beasley|first3=T.

The '''Chandra X-ray Observatory''' ('''CXO'''), previously known as the '''Advanced X-ray Astrophysics Facility''' ('''AXAF'''), is a [[Flagship program|Flagship-class]] [[space observatory]] launched on [[STS-93]] by [[NASA]] on July 23, 1999. Chandra is sensitive to X-ray sources 100 times fainter than any previous X-ray telescope, enabled by the high angular resolution of its mirrors. Since the [[Earth's atmosphere]] absorbs the vast majority of [[X-ray]]s, they are not detectable from Earth-based [[telescope]]s; therefore space-based telescopes are required to make these observations. Chandra is an Earth [[satellite]] in a 64-hour orbit, and its mission is ongoing {{as of|2018|lc=y}}.

Chandra is one of the [[Great Observatories program|Great Observatories]], along with the [[Hubble Space Telescope]], [[Compton Gamma Ray Observatory]] (1991–2000), and the [[Spitzer Space Telescope]]. The telescope is named after the Nobel Prize-winning [[Indian Americans|Indian-American]] astrophysicist [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]].&lt;ref name="cowinners1998"/&gt; Its mission is similar to that of [[ESA]]'s [[XMM-Newton]] spacecraft, also launched in 1999.

==History==
In 1976 the Chandra X-ray Observatory (called AXAF at the time) was proposed to NASA by [[Riccardo Giacconi]] and Harvey Tananbaum. Preliminary work began the following year at [[Marshall Space Flight Center]] (MSFC) and the [[Smithsonian Astrophysical Observatory]] (SAO). In the meantime, in 1978, NASA launched the first imaging X-ray telescope, [[Einstein Observatory|Einstein]] (HEAO-2), into orbit. Work continued on the AXAF project throughout the 1980s and 1990s. In 1992, to reduce costs, the spacecraft was redesigned. Four of the twelve planned mirrors were eliminated, as were two of the six scientific instruments. AXAF's planned orbit was changed to an elliptical one, reaching one third of the way to the Moon's at its farthest point. This eliminated the possibility of improvement or repair by the [[Space Shuttle program|space shuttle]] but put the observatory above the Earth's [[Van Allen radiation belt|radiation belts]] for most of its orbit. AXAF was assembled and tested by [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] (now [[Northrop Grumman]] Aerospace Systems) in [[Redondo Beach, California|Redondo Beach]], [[California]].

[[File:STS-93 launch.jpg|thumb|left|[[STS-93]] launches in 1999]]

AXAF was renamed Chandra as part of a contest held by NASA in 1998, which drew more than 6,000 submissions worldwide.&lt;ref name="harvard20131031"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chandra.harvard.edu/chronicle/0413/name/ |title=Tyrel Johnson &amp; Jatila van der Veen - Winners of the Chandra-Naming Contest - Where Are They Now? |publisher=Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics |first=Wallace |last=Tucker |date=October 31, 2013 |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contest winners, Jatila van der Veen and Tyrel Johnson (then a high school teacher and high school student, respectively), suggested the name in honor of Nobel Prize–winning [[Indian-American]] [[astrophysicist]] [[Subrahmanyan Chandrasekhar]]. He is known for his work in determining the [[Chandrasekhar limit|maximum mass]] of [[white dwarf]] stars, leading to greater understanding of high energy astronomical phenomena such as neutron stars and black holes.&lt;ref name="cowinners1998"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chandra.harvard.edu/contest/co_winners.html |title=And the co-winners are... |publisher=Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics |year=1998 |accessdate=January 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fittingly, the name Chandra means "moon" in Sanskrit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.behindthename.com/name/chandra|title=Meaning, origin and history of the name Chandra|first=Mike|last=Campbell|website=Behind the Name}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally scheduled to be launched in December 1998,&lt;ref name="harvard20131031" /&gt; the spacecraft was delayed several months, eventually being launched in July 23, 1999, at 04:31&amp;nbsp;UTC by {{OV|Columbia}} during [[STS-93]]. Chandra was deployed from ''Columbia'' at 11:47&amp;nbsp;UTC. The Inertial Upper Stage's first stage motor ignited at 12:48&amp;nbsp;UTC, and after burning for 125 seconds and separating, the second stage ignited at 12:51&amp;nbsp;UTC and burned for 117 seconds.&lt;ref name="cxc19990723"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.msfc.nasa.gov:80/NEWSROOM/news/status/chandrastatus/chandrastatus27.html |title=Chandra X-ray Observatory Status Report: July 23, 1999 6:00 p.m. EDT |series=Marshall Space Flight Center Status Reports |publisher=NASA |first=Dave |last=Drachlis |date=July 23, 1999 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20000226004401/http://www1.msfc.nasa.gov/NEWSROOM/news/status/chandrastatus/chandrastatus27.html |archivedate=February 26, 2000 |access-date=September 9, 2018 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; At {{convert|22753|kg|lb}},&lt;ref name="chandra-quick-facts"/&gt; it was the heaviest payload ever launched by the shuttle, a consequence of the two-stage [[Inertial Upper Stage]] booster rocket system needed to transport the spacecraft to its high orbit.

Chandra has been returning data since the month after it launched. It is operated by the SAO at the Chandra X-ray Center in [[Cambridge, Massachusetts]], with assistance from [[MIT]] and [[Northrop Grumman]] Space Technology. The ACIS CCDs suffered particle damage during early radiation belt passages. To prevent further damage, the instrument is now removed from the telescope's focal plane during passages.

Although Chandra was initially given an expected lifetime of 5 years, on September 4, 2001, NASA extended its lifetime to 10 years "based on the observatory's outstanding results."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chandra.harvard.edu/chronicle/0301/extended_mission.html |title=Chandra's Mission Extended to 2009 |publisher=Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics |date=September 28, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Physically Chandra could last much longer. A 2004 study performed at the Chandra X-ray Center indicated that the observatory could last at least 15 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Development and Scientific Impact of the Chandra X-Ray Observatory |journal=International Journal of Modern Physics D |first=Daniel A. |last=Schwartz |volume=13 |issue=7 |pages=1239–1248 |date=August 2004 |doi=10.1142/S0218271804005377 |arxiv=astro-ph/0402275|bibcode = 2004IJMPD..13.1239S }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2008, the [[International X-ray Observatory]], a joint project between [[ESA]], [[NASA]] and [[JAXA]], was proposed as the next major X-ray observatory but was later cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://constellation.gsfc.nasa.gov/ |title=International X-ray Observatory |work=NASA.gov |access-date=March 28, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080303062108/http://constellation.gsfc.nasa.gov/ |archive-date=March 3, 2008 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; ESA later resurrected the project as the [[Advanced Telescope for High Energy Astrophysics]] (ATHENA) with a proposed launch in 2028.&lt;ref name="space20131101"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/23440-athena-xray-space-telescope-2028.html |title=X-ray Space Telescope of the Future Could Launch in 2028 |work=Space.com |first=Elizabeth |last=Howell |date=November 1, 2013 |accessdate=January 1, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 10, 2018, Chandra entered safe mode operations, due to a gyroscope failure. NASA reported that all science instruments were safe.&lt;ref name="cnet20181012"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.cnet.com/news/another-nasa-space-telescope-chandra-x-ray-observatory-just-went-into-safe-mode/ |title=Another NASA space telescope just went into safe mode |work=CNET |first=Amanda |last=Kooser |date=October 12, 2018 |accessdate=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nasa20181012"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/chandra-enters-safe-mode-investigation-underway |title=Chandra Enters Safe Mode; Investigation Underway |publisher=NASA |editor-first=Brian |editor-last=Dunbar |date=October 12, 2018 |accessdate=October 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within days, the 3-second error in data from one gyro was understood, and plans made to return Chandra to full service.&lt;ref name=”2018-10-15_SI”&gt;[http://chandra.si.edu/press/18_releases/press_101518.html Chandra Operations Resume After Cause of Safe Mode Identified], news release, [[Smithsonian]], 2018-10-15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Example discoveries==
[[File:STS-93 crew.jpg|thumb|Crew of STS-93 with a scale model]]
The data gathered by Chandra has greatly advanced the field of [[X-ray astronomy]]. Here are some examples of discoveries supported by observations from Chandra:
*The [[First light (astronomy)|first light]] image, of [[supernova remnant]] [[Cassiopeia A]], gave astronomers their first glimpse of the [[compact object]] at the center of the remnant, probably a [[neutron star]] or [[black hole]]. (Pavlov, ''et al.'', 2000)
*In the [[Crab Nebula]], another supernova remnant, Chandra showed a never-before-seen ring around the central [[pulsar]] and jets that had only been partially seen by earlier telescopes. (Weisskopf, ''et al.'', 2000)
*The first X-ray emission was seen from the [[supermassive black hole]], [[Sagittarius A*]], at the [[Galactic Center|center]] of the [[Milky Way]]. (Baganoff, ''et al.'', 2001)
*Chandra found much more cool [[gas]] than expected spiraling into the center of the [[Andromeda Galaxy]].
*Pressure fronts were observed in detail for the first time in [[Abell 2142]], where [[galaxy cluster|clusters]] of galaxies are merging.
*The earliest images in X-rays of the [[shock wave]] of a [[supernova]] were taken of [[SN 1987A]].
*Chandra showed for the first time the shadow of a small [[galaxy]] as it is being cannibalized by a larger one, in an image of [[Perseus A]].
*A new type of black hole was discovered in galaxy [[Messier 82|M82]], mid-mass objects purported to be the missing link between [[Stellar black hole|stellar-sized black holes]] and [[super massive black holes]]. (Griffiths, ''et al.'', 2000)
*X-ray [[emission line]]s were associated for the first time with a [[gamma-ray burst]], [[Beethoven Burst]] GRB 991216. (Piro, ''et al.'', 2000)
*High school students, using Chandra data, [[CXOU J061705.3+222127|discovered]] a neutron star in supernova remnant [[IC 443]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://quest.nasa.gov/dso/news/press_release/12-11-00.txt |title=Students Using NASA and NSF Data Make Stellar Discovery; Win Science Team Competition |publisher=NASA |id=Release 00-195 |date=December 12, 2000 |accessdate=April 15, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510130847/http://quest.nasa.gov/dso/news/press_release/12-11-00.txt |archivedate=May 10, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Observations by Chandra and [[BeppoSAX]] suggest that gamma-ray bursts occur in [[star-forming region]]s.
*Chandra data suggested that [[RX J1856.5-3754]] and [[3C58]], previously thought to be pulsars, might be even denser objects: [[quark star]]s. These results are still debated.
*Sound waves from violent activity around a [[super massive black hole]] were observed in the [[Perseus Cluster]] (2003).
[[File:Chandra X-ray Observatory image of the brown dwarf TWA 5B.jpg|thumb|right|CXO image of the brown dwarf TWA 5B]]
*TWA 5B, a [[brown dwarf]], was seen orbiting a [[binary star|binary]] system of Sun-like [[star]]s.
*Nearly all stars on the [[main sequence]] are X-ray emitters. (Schmitt &amp; Liefke, 2004)
*The X-ray shadow of [[Titan (moon)|Titan]] was seen when it [[astronomical transit|transitted]] the Crab Nebula.
*X-ray emissions from materials falling from a [[protoplanetary disc]] into a star. (Kastner, ''et al.'', 2004)
*[[Hubble constant]] measured to be 76.9&amp;nbsp;km/s/Mpc using [[Sunyaev-Zel'dovich effect]].
*2006 Chandra found strong evidence that dark matter exists by observing super cluster collision
*2006 X-ray emitting loops, rings and filaments discovered around a [[super massive black hole]] within [[Messier 87]] imply the presence of pressure waves, shock waves and sound waves. The evolution of [[Messier 87]] may have been dramatically affected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://chandra.harvard.edu/press/06_releases/press_100506.html |title=Chandra Reviews Black Hole Musical: Epic But Off-Key |publisher=Harvard-Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics |first1=Steve |last1=Roy |first2=Megan |last2=Watzke |date=October 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike [[optical]] telescopes which possess simple aluminized [[Parabolic reflector|parabolic]] surfaces (mirrors), X-ray telescopes generally use a [[Wolter telescope]] consisting of nested cylindrical [[paraboloid]] and [[hyperboloid]] surfaces coated with [[iridium]] or [[gold]]. X-ray [[photon]]s would be absorbed by normal mirror surfaces, so mirrors with a low grazing angle are necessary to reflect them. Chandra uses four pairs of nested mirrors, together with their support structure, called the [[High Resolution Mirror Assembly]] (HRMA); the mirror substrate is 2&amp;nbsp;cm-thick glass, with the reflecting surface a 33&amp;nbsp;nm iridium coating, and the diameters are 65&amp;nbsp;cm, 87&amp;nbsp;cm, 99&amp;nbsp;cm and 123&amp;nbsp;cm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/Hrma/users_guide/hrma-notes.pdf |title=The HRMA User's Guide |publisher=Chandra X-ray Center |first1=T. J. |last1=Gaetz |first2=Diab |last2=Jerius |date=January 28, 2005 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060210070532/http://cxc.harvard.edu/cal/Hrma/users_guide/hrma-notes.pdf |archivedate=February 10, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; The thick substrate and particularly careful polishing allowed a very precise optical surface, which is responsible for Chandra's unmatched resolution: between 80% and 95% of the incoming X-ray energy is focused into a one-[[arcsecond]] circle. However, the thickness of the substrate limits the proportion of the aperture which is filled, leading to the low collecting area compared to [[XMM-Newton]].

Chandra's highly [[ellipse|elliptical]] orbit allows it to observe continuously for up to 55 hours of its 65-hour [[orbital period]]. At its furthest orbital point from Earth, Chandra is one of the most distant Earth-orbiting satellites. This orbit takes it beyond the geostationary satellites and beyond the outer [[Van Allen belt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.astro.princeton.edu/universe/ |title=Logarithmic Map of the Universe |publisher=Princeton University |first1=J. Richard |last1=Gott |first2=Mario |last2=Juric |year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With an [[angular resolution]] of 0.5 [[arcsecond]] (2.4 µrad), Chandra possesses a resolution over 1000 times better than that of the first orbiting X-ray telescope.

CXO uses mechanical [[gyroscope]]s,&lt;ref name="jwst-faq"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://jwst.nasa.gov/faq_scientists.html |title=Technical Frequently Asked Questions (FAQ) |series=James Webb Space Telescope |publisher=NASA |accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are sensors that help determine what direction the telescope is pointed.&lt;ref name="chandra-spacecraft"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://chandra.harvard.edu/about/spacecraft.html |title=Spacecraft: Motion, Heat, and Energy |series=Chandra X-ray Observatory |publisher=NASA |date=17 March 2014 |accessdate=14 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other navigation and orientation systems on board CXO include an aspect camera, Earth and [[Sun sensor]]s, and [[reaction wheel]]s. It also has two sets of thrusters, one for movement and another for offloading momentum.&lt;ref name="chandra-spacecraft" /&gt;

===Instruments===
The [[Science Instrument Module]] (SIM) holds the two focal plane instruments, the [[Advanced CCD Imaging Spectrometer]] (ACIS) and the [[High Resolution Camera]] (HRC), moving whichever is called for into position during an observation.

ACIS consists of 10 [[Charge-coupled device|CCD]] chips and provides images as well as [[spectroscopy|spectral]] information of the object observed. It operates in the [[photon energy]] range of 0.2–10 [[keV]]. HRC has two [[micro-channel plate]] components and images over the range of 0.1–10 keV. It also has a time resolution of 16 [[microsecond]]s. Both of these instruments can be used on their own or in conjunction with one of the observatory's two [[Diffraction grating|transmission gratings]].

The transmission gratings, which swing into the optical path behind the mirrors, provide Chandra with high resolution spectroscopy. The [http://space.mit.edu/HETG/ High Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer] (HETGS) works over 0.4–10 keV and has a [[spectral resolution]] of 60–1000. The [[Low Energy Transmission Grating Spectrometer]] (LETGS) has a range of 0.09–3 keV and a resolution of 40–2000.

'''Charles Sanford Terry''' (24 October 1864, [[Newport Pagnell]] – 5 November 1936, [[Aberdeen]])&lt;ref&gt;Terry died at his home, "Westerton of Pitfodels" in [[Cults, Aberdeenshire|Cults]], a suburb of Aberdeen.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Encyclopedia Americana|volume=26|publisher=Americana Corp.|year=1966|page=449}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weber|2004|page=51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Blom|2008|page=600}}&lt;/ref&gt; was an English historian and musicologist who published extensively on [[Scottish history|Scottish]] and [[European history]] as well as the life and works of [[J. S. Bach]].

==Career==
{{quote box|align=left|width=30%|quote= A man who has not got a hobby to jostle with his profession is a man to be pitied, and I take off my hat to St. Paul's for the many years of happiness in a pursuit of which my school-days there laid the foundation.|source= ''Charles Sanford Terry''&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|journal=[[The Musical Times]]|year=1913|title=Charles Sanford Terry|pages=370}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Terry was the eldest son of Charles Terry, a physician, and Ellen Octavia Prichard. After attending
[[St Paul's Cathedral School]], [[King's College School]], and [[Lancing College]], he was an undergraduate  at [[Clare College, Cambridge]], where he obtained a B.A. in  history (2nd class) in 1886 and an M.A. in 1891.&lt;ref&gt;{{acad|id=TRY883CS|name=Terry, Charles Sanford}}&lt;/ref&gt; He held lectureships in history at Durham College of Science (now part of the [[University of Newcastle-upon-Tyne]]), the [[University of Aberdeen]] and the [[University of Cambridge]]. In 1901 he married Edith Mary Allfrey of Newport Pagnell, daughter of Francis Allfrey, a brewer; the marriage was childless. He was appointed Burnett-Fletcher Professor of History and Archaeology at the University of Aberdeen from 1903 until his retirement in 1930. He served as president of the Association of Scottish History. Terry was also known as a composer and amateur musician. In 1898 he became conductor of the Aberdeen University Choral and Orchestral Society, with roughly 150 singers and 70 instrumentalists; and in 1909 he founded the [[Aberdeen and North East of Scotland Music Festival]].

Terry had a close professional and personal association with [[Edward Elgar]], both being involved in the [[Three Choirs Festival]] in the cathedrals of [[Hereford]], [[Gloucester]] and [[Worcester]]. Terry arranged for Elgar to receive an honorary doctorate from the University of Aberdeen in 1906 and four years later helped with the proofreading of the original manuscript of the [[Violin Concerto (Elgar)|violin concerto]], which Elgar later bequeathed to him.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adams|2007|pages=173–178}}&lt;/ref&gt; Terry later gifted this volume to his colleague at the University of Aberdeen [[Sir John Marnoch]] &lt;ref&gt;Bryan Adams (Ed.) Elgar and his world Princeton University Press 2007 {{ISBN|9781400832101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Terry published extensively on several aspects of Scottish history, and wrote a ''Short History of Europe'' (1806–1915). He published many books on the life and works of [[J. S. Bach]] between 1915 and 1932 and became known as an authority on Bach; his works have become classics in Bach scholarship.

The '''conservation and restoration of outdoor bronze artworks''' is an activity dedicated to the preservation, protection, and maintenance of [[bronze]] objects and [[artworks]] that are on view outside.   When applied to [[cultural heritage]] this activity is generally undertaken by a [[conservator-restorer]].

==Outdoor environmental issues==

There are a plethora of influences that the environment can have on outdoor bronze sculpture, and unfortunately there are no two identical places.  One method of conservation that works very well in one location may not work so well in another location.  A conservator needs to take into account numerous factors when preparing to work on a sculpture.  Some of these include the humidity, temperature, ultra-violet light, proximity to the sea, the amount of air pollution (especially if causing acid rain), and even what type of flora and fauna are in the area.  If the sculpture is part of a working fountain, the quality of running water (hard, soft, alkaline, acidic, etc.) is important.   How accessible the sculpture is to people and whether or not they would have the ability to climb on the sculpture is also an important factor.

According to Kipper, acid rain can be particularly harmful to bronze sculptures, because the main component is usually sulfides, or sulfuric acid, which can harm patinas and the bronze surfaces causing streaking to occur on the surface.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kipper|first=Patrick V.|title=The Care of Bronze Sculpture: Recommended Maintenance Programs for the  Collector|year=1996|publisher=Path Publications|location=Loveland, CO|isbn=0964726912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many different effects can occur on a sculpture due to being in an outdoor environment.  Just a couple of these include the formation of a black incrustation or a white powdery substance (mineral deposits) that has the potential to obscure the natural blue-green patina, or artificially applied patinas.  Pollution-formed crusts could cause the metal to deteriorate and form small pits in the metal if not removed.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Bronze fountains==
Protective elements for bronze fountains are particularly important, since water is one of the leading causes for alterations or corrosion in a bronze.&lt;ref name=":14"&gt;{{cite book|last=Naudé|first=Virginia N.|title=Guide to the Maintenance of Outdoor Sculpture|year=1993|publisher=American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|location=Washington, D.C.}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Bronze sculptures incorporated in fountains will need more layers of wax, because the spray of water will cause deterioration of the wax at a faster pace than would normally happen.  Different aspects of the water need to be monitored, including but not limited to pH, total alkalinity, and hardness or level of dissolved mineral salts.  There is a chance that the water will leave mineral deposits in a white/tan crust-like fashion.  That “crust” can cause damage or become more permanent if it comes in contact with the metal surface or a patina and needs to be periodically removed.  There are different chemical treatments that can be used to control the levels of these factors.  Usually the maintenance of fountains has to occur at a more frequent rate than other bronze sculptures as well.

==Past conservation methods==

In the late 19th century to early 20th century, one of the main ways to remove corrosion from archaeological bronze was through either chemical or electrolytic means.  Sculptures may have had only spots treated, or may have been completely submerged.  These electrochemical treatments resulted usually in the complete removal of any patina or surface material, returning the bronze to its original metal surface. Unfortunately this approach often had too severe of results, making the metal porous or leaving the surface with an unattractive appearance.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{cite book|last=Scott|first=David A.|title=Copper and Bronze in Art: Corrosion, Colorants, Conservation|year=2002|publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;    This general method of treatment is still used today in some varieties, just perhaps not as severe as in the past.

Alternatively, one of these past “methods” of conserving bronze in the past was to simply not treat it at all.  Of course, as to be expected, this had widely varying results—some archaeological bronzes survived in quite good condition, while others became so fragile they could crumble.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;   Some bronzes are highly prized for their remaining original patinas, such as some of the ancient Chinese bronzes, so they purposefully do not do treatments on them.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;

One method that is not all that different from treatments that are still performed now, is to dry the piece, carefully remove what corrosion is possible, and then seal the area or the whole bronze.  Other treatments have included a wide variety of substances, from “esoteric or mundane substances that range from secret concoctions to materials as prosaic as oven cleaner or lemon juice.”&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;

== Contemporary conservation methods ==

===Assessment of condition===
Before any conservative action can be taken, an in-depth assessment of the sculpture or object needs to be taken.  This includes, but is not limited to, looking at past conservation reports, the taking of current photographic documentation, assessing its current structural integrity, discussion with the artist/owner as to the depth of the conservation treatment desired, and testing of new or different treatments.

According to Virginia Naudé and Glenn Wharton, there are 4 steps that come with the assessment or survey of an outdoor sculpture, which they call an “Outdoor Sculpture Condition Survey” and whose steps are as following:&lt;ref name=":14"/&gt;
# Technical descriptions and condition assessments of each sculpture.  Included are identification of materials, information on fabrication, assessments of past maintenance practices, determination of surface condition, and descriptions of structural integrity.  Also important are comments about the effects of previous routine care, repairs, or treatment.
# Maintenance recommendations for each sculpture.  These recommendations are based on the history, condition, and location of the sculpture, the resources of the owner, and the relative needs of the sculpture in the context of the whole collection.  The maintenance recommendation should include information on routine care and periodic treatment.
# Assignment of priorities to recommended activities.  The conservator assigns priorities based on the technical information gathered.  These priorities will later be assessed in relation to art historical, fund-raising, and other priorities.
# Estimate of resources required.  The labor costs of the various maintenance options proposed are expressed either in monetary figures or in hours of work required for conservators, technicians, and other specialists.  An estimate of hours is particularly useful if the recommended work will not take place immediately.  Supplies and equipment costs are also included.

===Cleaning and removal of corrosion and incrustation===

====By hand====
One method of removing particularly tough incrustations off of a sculpture is by mechanical cleaning done by an individual.  Such methods could include heating or potentially applying a solvent to a specific location to weaken the incrustation, followed by removal with a scalpel, spatula, or other such device.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dent Weil|first=Phoebe|title=Problems of Preservation of Out-Door Bronze Sculpture: Examination and Treatment of ‘The Meeting of the Waters’ in St. Louis, Missouri|journal=Bulletin of the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|year=1974|volume=14|issue=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the sculpture or object, delicate work could be done under magnification with a low-heat light.  Some tools used in this scenario are: “glass-fiber brushes, painting brushes, dental picks, a pin held in a pin vice, wooden carving tools or sticks, and small camera bellows to blow away dust.”&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;

====Water blasting&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;====
Another method of cleaning bronze sculpture, especially ones that are outside, is water blasting.  Water can be pressurized at varying levels of psi, depending on what is needed for the individual case.  Different types of nozzles can direct the flow of water in unique ways, providing a versatile cleaning method. This method works particularly well on surfaces that are pitted or have large amounts of surface detail.

====Air abrasion====

=====Glass bead peening=====
Glass beads were used for a decade in the industry for the cleaning and “stress-conditioning” of metal machinery that needed to be very precisely prepared.  According to Phoebe Dent Weil,

"The beads, typically 100 µm in diameter, are highly elastic, leave no residue, and produce a metallurgically clean surface without abrasion. Unwanted scale, accretions and corrosion products are shattered and knocked off by the force of the blast, and the metal surface is peened or worked on a microscopic scale. As a result of the micro-peening, microscopic cracks and pits are sealed improving corrosion resistance.  Surface stresses in the metal are relieved and, as in the case of bronze, the metal surface is work-hardened producing a more compact crystalline structure in the metal surface and thereby prolonging the fatigue life and wearing qualities of the metal."&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dent Weil|first=Phoebe|title=The Use of Glass Bead Peening to Clean Large-Scale Out-Door Bronze Sculpture|journal=Bulletin of the American Institute for Conservation of Historic and Artistic Works|year=1974|volume=15|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dent Weil tested the peening process before use and found that on average less than 1&amp;nbsp;µm of metal was lost when applied to an area of 1&amp;nbsp;cm² when blasted for 10 minutes.  Because of the rate in which the incrustation was removed, they determined that this was negligible at best.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;  They also felt that since they only actually needed to go over one section of the sculpture for a maximum of 3 seconds (a far cry from the 10-minute test) that this was the best method, as well as the fact that unlike sand-blasting no silica dust is produced and there is no fear of silicosis.&lt;ref name=":7"/&gt;  One slight technical difficulty that has occurred with this method is in outdoor areas of high humidity the tubes have clogged up with the beads from the moisture. One solution that was proposed and carried out to solve this issue is the use of “wet peening.”  This process includes making a “slurry” of clean water and beads, increasing the moisture until it was no longer an issue and flowed smoothly through the tubes.  Not only did this solve the problem, but it was found to have drastically reduced the amount of beads needed, as well as limit final cleanup of the area since the beads didn’t ricochet as far.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Morris|first=Kenneth|author2=Jay W. Krueger|title=The Use of Wet Peening in the Conservation of Outdoor Bronze Sculpture|journal=Studies in Conservation|year=1979|volume=24|issue=1|pages=40, 42|doi=10.2307/1505921}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Contrary to Dent Weil’s case, others have been against glass bead peening for several reasons.  Nicholas F. Veloz, A. W. Ruff, and W. Thomas Chase performed a test to see whether or not glass bead peening really did not remove any metal from the sculpture and decreased the corrosion state as believed by many.  Their findings were the opposite of these beliefs however, when they discovered that it does indeed remove metal from the surface at a higher level than would be acceptable.  They also found that microscopically the surface of the bronze had been dented and pitted with little craters that had bits of metal that would flake off when colliding with one another and becoming brittle.  Their subsequent tests also revealed that far from decreasing the rate of corrosion, glass bead peening may in fact increase the rate of atmospheric corrosion since it increases the surface area allowing for more areas to contain particles and water.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Veloz|first=Nicholas F.|title=Practical Aspects of Using Walnut Shells for Cleaning Outdoor Sculpture|journal=APT Bulletin|year=1993|volume=25|issue=3/4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The end result is that while glass bead peening may be excellent for the immediate removal of incrustation and other matter, the long-term effect may be that it could harm the sculpture, and so should be used only with much consideration.  An alternate to glass bead peening is using walnut shells, which Veloz and his associates tested in conjunction with the glass beads and is discussed in the next section.

=====Air abrasion with walnut shells=====
Using walnut shells as an air abrasive was developed as a gentler form of cleaning than sand-blasting or glass bead peening.  Veloz found that a lower pressure of air is needed than the other varieties, though still a large quantity of air is required due to the finding that using a larger nozzle seemed to be more efficient (5/16-inch or 3/8-inch nozzle to be used with 35-40 pounds per square inch gauge).  Smaller particles are more effective than larger ones (60/200 mesh, referring to particles passing through 60 wires per inch, but not 200 wires per inch).  The best angle to hold the nozzle toward the sculpture is near perpendicular, but not quite—nearing closer 15 or 20 degrees away from exactly perpendicular.&lt;ref name=":10"/&gt;

Veloz and his associates, as afore mentioned, through multiple tests found that using walnut shells as an air abrasive caused no damaging effect to the surface of the bronze when viewed under the microscope, unlike the glass beads.  This is true because the abrasive particles have a greater elasticity than the surface of the bronze, causing them to crumple and absorb the blow instead of the bronze being the one to give under the force.  They also found that using walnut shells did not increase the rate of corrosion.  Their conclusion was that walnut shells were the superior choice of air abrasive, because it had all of the same benefits as glass beads, but none of the negative side effects.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

According to David A. Scott, Veloz, Ruff, and Chase’s findings were also confirmed by “Barbour and Lie” who did a series of tests including glass beads, 3 different types of plastic beads, sodium bicarbonate in a powder form, and walnut shells.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;

== Tools and products ==

===Coating materials===
According to Naudé and Wharton, “Coating materials are selected for their durability, adhesion, ease of maintenance, and surface appearance.  The selection of an appropriate coating system is governed by the bronze surface, environmental considerations, and expected degree of maintenance.”&lt;ref name=":14" /&gt;

====Wax&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; ====
''Clear Trewax Brand Paste Wax''

Trewax brand paste wax is made of carnauba wax (the only other natural wax aside from beeswax) suspended in turpentine  
Trewax works well on both light and dark patinas, and is fast drying.  However, if used on a warm surface it can smear or cause bulky build up (“mud pack”)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

''Johnson Paste Wax''

With Johnson brand paste wax there is a chance that it could cause a darkening of a lighter patina and should therefore be only used on darker patinas if that darkening is not desired.

''Renaissance Wax''

Renaissance wax is a hard wax that produces a high shine when it is buffed.  It is not always the easiest brand to find.

''Kiwi Neutral Shoe Polish''

Kiwi Neutral Shoe Polish can create a “high gloss” if desired and can be used in conjunction with Trewax brand paste wax.  It may darken light patinas, and so should only be used with medium to dark toned patinas.

''Butcher’s Wax''&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{cite book|last=Considine|first=Brian B.|title=Conserving Outdoor Sculpture: The Stark Collection at the Getty Center|year=2010|publisher=The Getty Conservation Institute|location=Los Angeles, CA}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Butcher’s wax is composed of paraffin and carnauba waxes as its main components.

''Liberon Special Effects Waxes''&lt;ref name=":15"/&gt;

Liberon has pre-toned waxes for when more than clear wax is necessary.

====Sealants, lacquers and corrosion inhibitors====
''Incralac''

Incralac was developed by the International Copper Research Association. It is made of a synthetic resin with what is often referred to as a corrosion inhibitor (benzotriazole) that is very durable in outdoor conditions.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;  Benzoltriazole has also been referred to as a UV stabilizer rather than a corrosion inhibitor.&lt;ref name=":11"/&gt;

''Cobratec 99''

Cobratec 99 is manufactured by Sherwin Williams Chemical Company. Cobratec 99 is a commercial grade of benzotriazole.  Care needs to be taken  (protective gloves and masks should be worn) because it is toxic if ingested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Zycherman|first=Lynda A.|author2=Nicholas F. Veloz Jr.|title=Conservation of a Monumental Outdoor Bronze Sculpture: "Theodore Roosevelt" By Paul Manship|journal=Journal of the American Institute for Conservation|year=1979|volume=19|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Brushes ===
A new 2-3 inch diameter soft bristled brush is a good choice for the application of wax. “Chip” brushes are easy to find in hardware stores, and are a good choice because of their natural bristles and relative inexpensiveness.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Soft bristled brushes (not metallic) are usually necessary for the initial cleaning of the sculpture.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Tape should be wrapped around the “ferrule” (the metal portion) on the brush so that it cannot come in direct contact with the bronze and cause scratching to occur.

===Cotton cloths===
Cotton cloths are used to buff the wax once it has been applied to the sculpture and it is fully dry.  Using a type that produces low amounts of lint is best so it does not get stuck in the wax.

===Cotton Gloves===
Cotton gloves should be worn when dealing with delicate bronze or delicate patinas, so that the oil from fingers will not further damage the piece.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Soap===
Detergents should be neutral or non-ionic for the preliminary washing of the sculpture. According to Judith M. Jacob and Glenn Wharton, “Detergents increase the wetting action of water, thereby increasing its ability to remove soiling materials. Non-ionic detergents are low in toxicity and can be easily rinsed from surfaces.”&lt;ref name="Jacob"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=Judith M.|author2=Glenn Wharton|title=Caring for Outdoor Bronze Plaques, Part II: Cleaning and Waxing|journal=National Park Service: Conserve O Gram|date=September 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Non-ionic detergents:&lt;ref name="Jacob"/&gt;

'''Cytoplasmic determinants''' are special molecules which play a very important role during [[oocyte maturation]], in the female's ovary. During this period of time, some regions of the [[cytoplasm]] accumulate some of these cytoplasmic determinants, whose distribution is thus very heterogenic. They play a major role in the development of the embryo's organs. Each type of cell is determined by a particular determinant or group of determinants. Thus, all the organs of the future embryo are distributed and operating well thanks to the right position of the cytoplasmic determinants. The action of the determinants on the [[blastomere]]s is one of the most important ones. During the [[Segmentation (biology)|segmentation]], cytoplasmic determinants are distributed among the [[blastomere]]s, at different times depending on the species and on the type of determinant. Therefore, the daughter cells resulting from the first divisions are totipotent : they can, independently, lead to a complete individual. That is not possible after the cytoplasmic determinants have been distributed in the differentiated blastomeres.

== Mosaic development ==
During the mosaic development, the future embryo contains all the distinct cytoplasmic determinants that are distributed in distinct cells. Regions of the organism differentiate very quickly if each cell contains specific cytoplasmic determinants since the first divisions : then the cell divides to give all the other cell of its type, and the same process happens in all types of cells in the organism.
As a result, in the case of the mosaic development, cell [[Totipotent|totipotence]] disappears very quickly during [[Segmentation (biology)|segmentation]]. Indeed, each new created cell determines a new region of the future organism, and it is independent from the other ones : thus development is independent from interaction between cells. It is most of all known in certain animals as nematodes ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans|C. elegans]]'', or [[ascidians]] (marine animals).

== Regulation development ==
Other animals show regulation development; their cells show totipotence for a longer time. In these animals, cytoplasmic determinants are more rapidly distributed between newly created cells.{{citation needed|date=October 2016}} [[Mammals]] are an example of animals that undergo regulation development.

== Presumptive territories map ==
The [[zygote]] already contains the future organization of the embryo, through cytoplasmic determinants distribution. Presumptive Territories Maps could be established simply by coloring particular regions of the zygote's [[cytoplasm]].

A '''design director''' is a position usually found within the [[advertising]], [[Mass media|media]], [[automotive]] or [[entertainment industry|entertainment]] industries, but may be useful in other creative organizations such as [[web development]] and [[software development]] firms as well. The position has similarities to that of a [[creative director]]. The design director oversees the design of [[brand]]ing and advertising for a client, ensuring that the new branding and advertising fits in with the client's requirements and the image they wish to promote for their company or product. However, unlike a creative director, the design director is not responsible for the overall quality of the final creative work, but merely for the quality of the project's design elements.

Another distinction between the two positions is that advertising creative directors are usually promoted from copywriting or art directing positions. Design directors, on the other hand, are promoted from [[senior designer]] positions.

'''Doxa''' ([[ancient Greek]] δόξα; from verb δοκεῖν ''dokein'', "to appear", "to seem", "to think" and "to accept"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Ddoke%2Fw δοκέω] in Liddell and Scott&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[Greek language|Greek]] word meaning common [[belief]] or popular [[opinion]]. Used by the Greek [[rhetorics|rhetoricians]] as a tool for the formation of argument by using common opinions, the ''doxa'' was often manipulated by [[sophist]]s to [[persuasion|persuade]] the [[people]], leading to [[Plato]]'s condemnation of [[Athenian democracy]].

The word ''doxa'' picked up a new meaning between the 3rd and 1st centuries BC when the [[Septuagint]] translated the Hebrew word for "glory" (כבוד, ''kavod'') as ''doxa''. This translation of the Hebrew Scriptures was used by the [[early church]] and is quoted frequently by the New Testament authors. The effects of this new meaning of ''doxa'' as "glory" is made evident by the [[ubiquitous]] use of the word throughout the New Testament and in the worship services of the [[Greek Orthodox Church]], where the glorification of God in true worship is also seen as true belief. In that context, doxa reflects behavior or practice in worship, and the belief of the whole church rather than personal opinion. It is the unification of these multiple meanings of doxa that is reflected in the modern terms of [[orthodoxy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=orthodox |title="Orthodox" Etymology |accessdate=2008-07-01 |last=Harper |first=Douglas |work= |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[heterodoxy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=heterodox |title="Heterodox" Etymology |accessdate=2008-07-01 |last=Harper |first=Douglas |work= |publisher=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |date=November 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ware |first1=Bishop Kallistos (Timothy) |authorlink1=Kallistos Ware |title=The Orthodox Church |edition=new |pages=8,266 |location=New York, NY, USA |publisher=Penguin Books |date=29 Apr 1993 |isbn=978-0-14-014656-1 |ref=none }}&lt;/ref&gt; This semantic merging in the word ''doxa'' is also seen in Russian word слава (''slava''), which means ''glory'', but is used with the meaning of ''belief'', ''opinion'' in words like православие (''pravoslavie'', meaning ''orthodoxy'', or, literally, ''true belief'').

==Doxa, a philosopheme==
In Plato's [[Gorgias (dialogue)]], Plato presents the Sophists, rhetors who taught people how to speak for the promise of commercial success, as wordsmiths that ensnare and use the malleable doxa of the "multitude" to their advantage without shame.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://classics.mit.edu/Plato/gorgias.html |title='Gorgias |last=Plato |date= 380 B.C.E.  |trans-title=Benjamin Jowett |publisher=[[Internet Classics Archive]] |accessdate=2013-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this and other writings, Plato relegated doxa as being a belief, unrelated to reason, that resided in the unreasoning, lower-parts of the soul.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Sorabji |first1=Richard|editor-last=Nussbaum |editor-first=Martha C.|date= March 26, 1992 |title= Essays on Aristotle's De Anima |publisher= Oxford University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; This viewpoint extended into the concept of doxasta in Plato's [[Theory of Forms]], which states that physical objects are manifestations of doxa and are thus not in their true form.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last= Szaif |first= Jan |date= 2007 |title= Doxa and Episteme as Modes of Acquaintance in Republic V |url= http://philosophy.ucdavis.edu/people/jmszaif/jan-szaifs-home-page/talks-and-final-drafts/doxa-and-episteme-as-modes-of-acquaintance-in-republic-v/view |journal= Les Etudes Platoniciennes |publisher= Les Belles Lettres |volume= IV |pages= 253–272 |accessdate= 2 March 2014 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140306030717/http://philosophy.ucdavis.edu/people/jmszaif/jan-szaifs-home-page/talks-and-final-drafts/doxa-and-episteme-as-modes-of-acquaintance-in-republic-v/view |archivedate= 6 March 2014 |df=  }} &lt;/ref&gt; Plato's framing of ''doxa'' as the opponent of [[knowledge]] led to the classical opposition of [[error]] to [[truth]], which has since become a major concern in [[Western philosophy]]. (However, in the ''Theaetetus'' and in the ''Meno'', Plato has [[Socrates]] suggest that knowledge is ''orthos doxa'' for which one can provide a ''logos'', thus initiating the traditional definition of knowledge as "[[justified true belief]]".) Thus, error is considered in [[Western world|Occident]] as pure negativity, which can take various forms, among them the form of [[illusion]]. As such, ''doxa'' may ironically be defined as the "philosopher's sin" {{citation needed|reason=interesting idea, but needs evidence|date=January 2016}}. In classical rhetoric, it is contrasted with ''[[episteme]]''.

Plato's student [[Aristotle]] objected to Plato's theory of doxa. Aristotle perceived that doxa's value was in practicality and common usage, in contrast with Plato's philosophical purity relegating doxa to deception. Further, Aristotle held doxa as the first step in finding knowledge, as doxa had found applications in the physical world and those who held it had a great number of tests done to prove it and thus reason to believe it.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite web |url= http://search.credoreference.com/content/entry/sageukcst/doxa/0 |title= Doxa |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date=2005  |website= Credo Reference |publisher= Sage UK |accessdate=March 2, 2014}} &lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle clarifies this by categorizing the accepted truths of the physical world that are passed down from generation to generation as ''endoxa''.&lt;ref&gt; {{cite journal |last=Eggs |first= Ekkehard |last2= McElholm |first2= Dermot |date= 2002 |title= Doxa in Poetry: A Study of Aristotle's Poetics |url= http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/poetics_today/v023/23.3eggs.pdf |journal= Poetics Today  |publisher= Duke University Press |volume= 23 |pages= 395-426 |accessdate= March 1, 2014 |doi=10.1215/03335372-23-3-395}} &lt;/ref&gt; Endoxa is a more stable belief than ''doxa'', because it has been "tested" in argumentative struggles in the ''[[Polis]]'' by prior interlocutors. The use of ''endoxa'' in the Stagirite's ''[[Organon]]'' can be found in Aristotle's ''[[Topics (Aristotle)|Topics]]'' and ''[[Rhetoric]]''.

==Use in sociology and anthropology&lt;!--linked from 'Pierre Bourdieu'--&gt;==

[[Pierre Bourdieu]], in his ''Outline of a Theory of Practice'',&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. 1977 [1972]. Outline of a Theory of Practice. R. Nice, transl. Volume 16. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press&lt;/ref&gt; used the term ''doxa'' to denote what is taken for granted in any particular society. The ''doxa'', in his view, is the experience by which "the natural and social world appears as self-evident".&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu (1972); p.164&lt;/ref&gt; It encompasses what falls within the limits of the thinkable and the sayable ("the universe of possible discourse"), that which "goes without saying because it comes without saying".&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu (1972); pp. 167, 169&lt;/ref&gt; The humanist instances of Bourdieu's application of notion of ''doxa'' are to be traced in ''Distinction'' where ''doxa'' sets limits on social mobility within the social space through limits imposed on the characteristic consumption of each social individual: certain cultural artifacts are recognized by ''doxa'' as being inappropriate to actual social position, hence ''doxa'' helps to petrify social limits, the "sense of one's place", and one's sense of belonging, which is closely connected with the idea that "this is not for us" (''ce n'est pas pour nous''). Thus individuals become voluntary subjects of those incorporated mental structures that deprive them of more deliberate consumption.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, Pierre. 1979. La Distinction. Critique Sociale du Jugement. Paris: Les éditions de minuit. Page 549&lt;/ref&gt;

Doxa and opinion denote, respectively, a society's taken-for-granted, unquestioned truths, and the sphere of that which may be openly contested and discussed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anthrobase.com/Dic/eng/pers/bourdieu_pierre.htm Pierre Bourdieu - AnthroBase - Dictionary of Anthropology: A searchable database of anthropological texts&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Bourdieu explains the term "doxa" in his interview with theorist [[Terry Eagleton]]. To explain the term, he uses an example about the common beliefs in school. He asked students what qualifies as achievement in school. In response, the students on the lower end of the academic spectrum viewed themselves as being inferior or not as smart as the students who excelled. The responses are where doxa comes into play, because that was the common belief and attitude that the students had based on what society pushed them to believe. Bourdieu believes that doxa derived from socialization, because socialization also deals with beliefs deriving from society, and as we grow up in the environment, we tend to believe what society tells us is correct.

It is a socially accepted misconception, that if you do not score as high as someone else then you are obviously not as smart as they are. Scores do not prove that one is smarter, because there are many different factors that play into what you score on a test. People may excel within a certain topic and fail at another. However, even though it is a misconception, people tend to partake in common practices to make themselves feel better. For example, the students who feel inferior due to popular belief that they are not as smart as the students who score higher than them, may experiment with drugs to ease the insecurities they face. Bourdieu believes that doxa is more than common belief. He believes that it also has the potential to give rise to common action.&lt;ref&gt;Bourdieu, P. and Eagleton, T. "Doxa and common life". New Left Review, 1992, p. 199, 111-121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vernon, Phillip E. "Intelligence and Cultural Environment". London: Methuen, 1969, p 215. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Role in democracy==

While doxa is used as a tool for the formation of [[argument]], it should be noted that it is also formed by argument. The former can be understood as told by [[James A. Herrick]] in ''The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction'': "The Sophists in Gorgias hold that rhetoric creates truth that is useful for the moment out of doxa, or the opinions of the people, through the process of argument and counterargument. Socrates will have no part of this sort of 'truth' which, nevertheless, is essential to a democracy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Herrick|first=James, A.|title=The History and Theory of Rhetoric: An Introduction, 3rd ed.|year=2005|publisher=Allyn and Bacon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Importantly noted, democracy, which by definition is the manifestation of public opinion, is dependent upon, and therefore also constrained by, the same limits imposed upon the individuals responsible for its establishment. Due to compromised opinions within a society, as well as opinions not counted for due to inaccessibility and apathy, doxa is not [[homogeneous]], nor is it created agreeably. Rather, it is pliable and imperfect—the outcome of an ongoing power struggle between clashing "truths".
 
To expand upon the quote from his ''Outline of a Theory of Practice'' in the above section, "Use in sociology and anthropology", Bourdieu writes, "When there is a quasi-perfect correspondence between the objective order and the subjective principles of organization (as in ancient societies) the natural and social world appears as self-evident. This experience we shall call doxa".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bourdieu|first=Pierre|title=Outline of a Theory of Practice|year=1977|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adam Smith of the [[University of Chicago]] observes in his article "The limitations of doxa: agency and subjectivity from an archaeological point of view": "Bourdieu consigns the practices of the denizens of ancient societies to the realm of doxa, their lives cast as routines predicated upon the mis-recognition of social orders as natural ways of life, rather than political products."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Smith|first=Adam T.|title=The Limitations of Doxa: Agency and subjectivity from an archaeological point of view|journal=Journal of Social Archaeology|year=2001|volume=1|issue=2|page=156|doi=10.1177/146960530100100201}}&lt;/ref&gt; This calls to attention that the notion of social order as naturally occurring is misperceived, disregarding its creation by political argumentation.
 
Doxa, then, can be understood as created by argument as well as used in the formation of argument, essential for the establishment of democratic policies.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3502">'''Electrical system design''' is the design of [[Electricity|electrical]] [[systems]].  This can be as simple as a [[Battery (electricity)|flashlight cell]] connected through two [[wire]]s to a [[light bulb]] or as involved as the [[space shuttle]]. Electrical systems are groups of electrical components connected to carry out some operation. Often the systems are combined with other systems. They might be subsystems of larger systems and have subsystems of their own. For example, a subway [[rapid transit]] electrical system is composed of the wayside electrical power supply, wayside control system, and the electrical systems of each transit car. Each transit car’s electrical system is a subsystem of the subway system. Inside of each transit car there are also subsystems, such as the car climate control system.

==Design==
The following would be appropriate for the design of a moderate to large electrical system.
# A [[specification]] document is written. It probably would have been written by the customer. The specification document states in plain language and numerical detail what the customer expects. If it is well written, it will be used as a reference throughout the electrical system design.
# A [[functional specification]] (design) document that goes into more technical details may be created. It uses the specification document as its basis. Here calculations may be used or referenced to support design decisions.
# Functional diagrams may be made. These use block diagrams indicating information and electrical power flow from component to component. They are similar to the [[functional flow block diagram]]s used with computer programs.
# [[Schematic]] diagrams showing the electrical interconnections between the components are made. They may not show all the conductors and termination points. Except for [[one-line diagram]]s, this should show all the [[circuit nodes]]. One-line diagrams represent the three or four conductors of three-phase power circuits with one line.
# [[Wiring diagram]]s are sometimes made. These show and name the termination points and names of each conductor. In some systems enough information can be put onto the schematics so that wiring diagrams are not needed.
# Physically smaller systems that are built many times may use a [[cable harness]]. A full-sized to-scale wiring diagram can be made of a cable harness. This wiring diagram can then be laid on a peg board and used to guide the construction of more cable harnesses. Harnesses can be inserted into their equipment as an assembly. Cable harnesses that are reused many times, '''like''' automobile wiring harnesses, are created with automated machinery.
# A wire list is made in [[spreadsheet]] or list format. It shows the electrical assembly people what wires are to be connected and to where. When it is printed out on paper, it is easy for the assembly people to check off conductors as they are connected. The wire list contains at a minimum each wire name, terminal name, and wire model number or gage. It may also contain the wire termination device model numbers, voltage classes, conductor class (high-voltage, medium voltage, or control wiring), etc.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15232">One of the prime [[list of systems of plant taxonomy|systems of plant taxonomy]], the '''Engler system''' was devised by [[Adolf Engler]] (1844–1930), and is featured in two major taxonomic texts he authored or coauthored. His influence is reflected in the use of the terms "Engler School" and "Engler Era". Engler's starting point was that of [[Eichler system|Eichler]] who had been the first to use [[phylogenetic]] principles, although Engler himself did not think that his was.{{sfn|Bhattacharyya|2005|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=V2QyHhwOnQQC&amp;pg=PA59 Linnaeus' System of Classification and Thereafter p.&amp;nbsp;59]}}

== Engler's works ==
His modified Eichler schema first appeared in 1886 in his ''Guide to Breslau Botanic Garden''{{sfn|Engler|1886|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=sUcyAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA10 Systematische Abteilung pp.&amp;nbsp;10–11]}} (of which he was the director) and was expanded in his ''[[Syllabus der Pflanzenfamilien]]'' in 1892.{{sfn|Naik|1984}} This reflected the new post-[[Darwinian]] perspective. Engler's ''Syllabus'' first appeared in 1892 with the title ''Syllabus der Vorlesungen über specielle und medicinisch-pharmaceutische Botanik''. Many subsequent editions have appeared since, and it was continued after Engler's death in 1930. The most recent edition was the 13th in 2009.{{sfn|Frey|Stech|Fischer|2009}}

The other major work was ''[[Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien]]'' (1887-1915) written with [[Karl Anton Prantl]] in 23 volumes.{{sfn|Engler|Prantl|1887–1915}} An incomplete second edition was issued in 28 parts (1924-1980).{{sfn|Frodin|2001|loc=p.&amp;nbsp;98}} ''Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien'' consisted of a complete revision of plant families down to generic level and often even further.{{sfn|Stace|1989|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VfQnuwh3bw8C&amp;pg=PA31 Post-Darwinian phylogenetic systems p.&amp;nbsp;31]}} ''Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien'' is still considered one of the few true World Floras.{{sfn|Stace|1989|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VfQnuwh3bw8C&amp;pg=PA31 Post-Darwinian phylogenetic systems p.&amp;nbsp;31]}}{{sfn|Bhattacharyya|2005}} Finally there was the also incomplete ''Das Pflanzenreich'' (1900–1968),{{sfn|Engler|1900–1968}} a multi-authored work which attempted to provide a modern version of [[Linnaeus]]' ''[[Species Plantarum]]'' (1753).{{sfn|Stace|1989|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VfQnuwh3bw8C&amp;pg=PA31 Post-Darwinian phylogenetic systems p.&amp;nbsp;31]}} The Engler system rapidly became the most widely used system in the world.{{sfn|Walters|Keil|1996|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbaNxSnNoecC&amp;pg=PA469 Traditional phylogenetic classification p.&amp;nbsp;469]}}

References to the Engler system may imply an edition of the ''Syllabus der Pflanzenfamilien'' or ''Die Natürlichen Pflanzenfamilien''. The different approaches between the two works and the different editions has resulted in inconsistencies in the descriptions of the system. A number of references to the Engler system actually refer to later revisions ('[[modified Engler system]]') undertaken by [[Hans Melchior|Melchior]] and colleagues, the 12th edition of the ''Syllabus'' (1964). Many of the world's [[herbaria]] have been organised on the Engler system, particularly in North America and in Europe other than Britain.{{sfn|Stace|1989|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VfQnuwh3bw8C&amp;pg=PA31 Post-Darwinian phylogenetic systems p.&amp;nbsp;31]}}{{sfn|Walters|Keil|1996|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=ZbaNxSnNoecC&amp;pg=PA74 Final stages of processing specimens p.&amp;nbsp;74]}}

Plants were considered to form a number of divisions (''Abteilung''), the number of which continually changed but initially (1886) was four and in 1919 was thirteen. Many of these referred to lower life forms such as bacteria and algae that would not necessarily be considered as plants today. Initially higher plants ([[Embryophyta]] or terrestrial plants) were considered in two divisions, ''Embryophyta Asiphonogama'' (bryophytes, pteridophytes) and ''Embryophyta Siphonogama'' ([[Spermatophytes]]: gymnosperms, angiosperms), but were later subdivided. ''Embryophyta Siphonogama'' replaced the older term Phanerogamae, and the classes were further divided into groups of families, called orders. Engler followed Eichler's phylogeny, placing the monocotyledons before the dicotyledons, and within the latter the [[Archichlamydeae]] before the [[Metachlamydeae]].{{sfn|Stace|1989|loc=[https://books.google.com/books?id=VfQnuwh3bw8C&amp;pg=PA31 Post-Darwinian phylogenetic systems p.&amp;nbsp;31]}} While the groupings were largely based on those of [[Bentham and Hooker]], the ordering was very much based on the concept of the primitive plant and those that were derived from these.

{{Evolutionary biology}}
'''Evidence of common descent''' of living [[organism]]s has been discovered by scientists researching in a variety of disciplines over many decades, demonstrating that [[common descent|all life on Earth comes from a single ancestor]]. This forms an important part of the [[Scientific evidence|evidence]] on which evolutionary theory rests, demonstrates that [[evolution]] does occur, and illustrates the processes that created Earth's [[biodiversity]]. It supports the [[Neo-Darwinism|modern evolutionary synthesis]]—the current [[scientific theory]] that explains how and why life changes over time. Evolutionary biologists document evidence of common descent, all the way back to the [[last universal common ancestor]], by developing testable predictions, testing hypotheses, and constructing theories that illustrate and describe its causes.

Comparison of the [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA genetic sequence]]s of organisms has revealed that organisms that are [[phylogenetics|phylogenetically]] close have a higher degree of DNA sequence similarity than organisms that are phylogenetically distant. Genetic fragments such as [[pseudogene]]s, regions of [[DNA]] that are [[Homology (biology)#Orthology|orthologous]] to a gene in a related [[organism]], but are no longer active and appear to be undergoing a steady process of degeneration from cumulative mutations support common descent alongside the universal biochemical organization and molecular variance patterns found in all organisms. Additional genetic information conclusively supports the relatedness of life and has allowed scientists (since the discovery of DNA) to develop phylogenetic trees: a construction of organisms evolutionary relatedness. It has also led to the development of [[molecular clock]] techniques to date taxon divergence times and to calibrate these with the fossil record.

[[Fossils]] are important for estimating when various lineages developed in [[geologic time]]. As fossilization is an uncommon occurrence, usually requiring hard body parts and death near a site where [[sediment]]s are being deposited, the fossil record only provides sparse and intermittent information about the evolution of life. Evidence of organisms prior to the development of hard body parts such as shells, bones and teeth is especially scarce, but exists in the form of ancient [[microfossil]]s, as well as impressions of various soft-bodied organisms. The comparative study of the [[anatomy]] of groups of animals shows structural features that are fundamentally similar (homologous), demonstrating phylogenetic and ancestral relationships with other organisms, most especially when compared with fossils of ancient [[Extinction|extinct]] organisms. [[Vestigiality|Vestigial structures]] and comparisons in [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]] are largely a contributing factor in anatomical resemblance in concordance with common descent. Since [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes do not leave fossils, research into the evolution of the basic cellular processes is done largely by comparison of existing organisms' [[physiology]] and [[biochemistry]]. Many lineages diverged at different stages of development, so it is possible to determine when certain metabolic processes appeared by comparing the traits of the descendants of a common ancestor.

Evidence from [[animal coloration]] was gathered by some of Darwin's contemporaries; [[camouflage]], [[mimicry]], and [[aposematism|warning coloration]] are all readily explained by natural selection. Special cases like the seasonal changes in the plumage of the [[rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]], camouflaging it [[snow camouflage|against snow]] in winter and [[disruptive coloration|against brown moorland]] in summer provide compelling evidence that selection is at work. Further evidence comes from the field of [[biogeography]] because evolution with common descent provides the best and most thorough explanation for a variety of facts concerning the geographical distribution of plants and animals across the world. This is especially obvious in the field of [[insular biogeography]]. Combined with the well-established geological theory of [[plate tectonics]], common descent provides a way to combine facts about the current distribution of species with evidence from the fossil record to provide a logically consistent explanation of how the distribution of living organisms has changed over time.

The development and spread of [[Antibiotic resistance|antibiotic resistant]] bacteria provides evidence that evolution due to [[natural selection]] is an ongoing process in the natural world. Natural selection is ubiquitous in all research pertaining to evolution, taking note of the fact that all of the following examples in each section of the article document the process. Alongside this are observed instances of the separation of populations of species into sets of new species ([[speciation]]). Speciation has been [[Laboratory experiments of speciation|observed in the lab]] and in nature. Multiple forms of such have been described and documented as examples for individual modes of speciation. Furthermore, evidence of common descent extends from direct laboratory experimentation with the [[selective breeding]] of organisms—historically and currently—and other controlled experiments involving many of the topics in the article. This article summarizes the varying disciplines that provide the evidence for evolution and the common descent of all life on Earth, accompanied by numerous and specialized examples, indicating a compelling [[Consilience|consilience of evidence]].

==Evidence from comparative physiology and biochemistry==
{{See also|Archaeogenetics|Common descent|Last universal ancestor|Most recent common ancestor|Universal Code (Biology)}}

===Genetics===
One of the strongest evidences for common descent comes from gene sequences. [[Sequence alignment|Comparative sequence analysis]] examines the relationship between the DNA sequences of different species,&lt;ref name=mount&gt;{{cite book| last=Mount | first=D.M. | year=2004 | title=Bioinformatics: Sequence and Genome Analysis |edition=2nd | publisher= Cold Spring Harbor Laboratory Press: Cold Spring Harbor, NY. |isbn=978-0-87969-608-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; producing several lines of evidence that confirm Darwin's original hypothesis of common descent. If the hypothesis of common descent is true, then species that share a common ancestor inherited that ancestor's DNA sequence, as well as mutations unique to that ancestor. More closely related species have a greater fraction of identical sequence and shared substitutions compared to more distantly related species.

[[File:HMS Beagle by Conrad Martens.jpg|thumb|right|'''Figure 1a:''' While on board [[HMS Beagle|HMS ''Beagle'']], [[Charles Darwin]] collected numerous specimens, many new to science, which supported his later theory of evolution by [[natural selection]].]]

The simplest and most powerful evidence is provided by [[Computational phylogenetics|phylogenetic reconstruction]]. Such reconstructions, especially when done using slowly evolving protein sequences, are often quite robust and can be used to reconstruct a great deal of the evolutionary history of modern organisms (and even in some instances of the evolutionary history of extinct organisms, such as the recovered gene sequences of [[mammoth]]s or [[Neanderthal]]s). These reconstructed phylogenies recapitulate the relationships established through morphological and biochemical studies.&lt;ref name="PennyFoulds1982"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Penny |first1=David |last2=Foulds |first2=L. R. |last3=Hendy |first3=M. D. |title=Testing the theory of evolution by comparing phylogenetic trees constructed from five different protein sequences |journal=Nature |volume=297 |issue=5863 |year=1982 |pages=197–200 |doi=10.1038/297197a0|pmid=7078635 |bibcode=1982Natur.297..197P }}&lt;/ref&gt; The most detailed reconstructions have been performed on the basis of the mitochondrial genomes shared by all [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] organisms,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tolweb.org/Eukaryotes/3#DiscussionofPhylogeneticRelationships|title=Eukaryotes|website=www.tolweb.org|access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; which are short and easy to sequence; the broadest reconstructions have been performed either using the sequences of a few very ancient proteins or by using [[ribosomal RNA]] sequence.{{Citation needed|date=October 2014|reason=Needs citation for "the broadest reconstructions have been performed either using the sequences of a few very ancient proteins or by using ribosomal RNA sequence."}}

Phylogenetic relationships extend to a wide variety of nonfunctional sequence elements, including repeats, [[transposon]]s, [[pseudogene]]s, and [[silent mutation|mutations in protein-coding sequences that do not change the amino-acid sequence]]. While a minority of these elements might later be found to harbor function, in aggregate they demonstrate that identity must be the product of common descent rather than common function.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Max, Edward |date=5 May 2003 |title=Plagiarized Errors and Molecular Genetics |website=The Talk Origins Archive |url=http://talkorigins.org/faqs/molgen/ |accessdate=4 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Universal biochemical organisation and molecular variance patterns====
All known [[extant taxon|extant]] (surviving) organisms are based on the same biochemical processes: genetic information encoded as nucleic acid ([[DNA]], or [[RNA]] for many viruses), transcribed into [[RNA]], then translated into [[protein]]s (that is, polymers of [[amino acid]]s) by highly conserved [[ribosome]]s. Perhaps most tellingly, the [[Genetic Code]] (the "translation table" between DNA and amino acids) is the same for almost every organism, meaning that a piece of [[DNA]] in a [[bacteria|bacterium]] codes for the same amino acid as in a human [[cell (biology)|cell]]. [[Adenosine triphosphate|ATP]] is used as energy currency by all extant life. A deeper understanding of [[Evolutionary developmental biology|developmental biology]] shows that common morphology is, in fact, the product of shared genetic elements.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Evolutionary Biology| edition=3rd| first=Douglas J. | last=Futuyma  |authorlink=Douglas Futuyma | year=1998| pages=108–110| publisher=Sinauer Associates | isbn=978-0-87893-189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, although camera-like eyes are believed to have evolved independently on many separate occasions,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |isbn=978-0-19-854980-2|author=Haszprunar |year=1995 |editor=Taylor |chapter=The mollusca: Coelomate turbellarians or mesenchymate annelids?|publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford |title=Origin and evolutionary radiation of the Mollusca : centenary symposium of the Malacological Society of London}}&lt;/ref&gt; they share a common set of light-sensing proteins ([[opsin]]s), suggesting a common point of origin for all sighted creatures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.imls.uzh.ch/research/noll/publ/Dev_Cell_2003_5_773_785.pdf |pmid=14602077 |year=2003 |last1=Kozmik |first1=Z. |last2=Daube |first2=M. |last3=Frei |first3=E. |last4=Norman |first4=B. |last5=Kos |first5=L. |last6=Dishaw |first6=L.J. |last7=Noll |first7=M. |last8=Piatigorsky |first8=J. |title=Role of Pax genes in eye evolution: A cnidarian PaxB gene uniting Pax2 and Pax6 functions |volume=5 |issue=5 |pages=773–785 |journal=Developmental Cell |doi=10.1016/S1534-5807(03)00325-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Land, M.F. and Nilsson, D.-E., ''Animal Eyes'', Oxford University Press, Oxford (2002) {{ISBN|0-19-850968-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Another example is the familiar vertebrate body plan, whose structure is controlled by the [[Hox gene|homeobox (Hox) family of genes]].

====DNA sequencing====

Comparison of DNA sequences allows organisms to be grouped by sequence similarity, and the resulting [[phylogenetics|phylogenetic]] trees are typically congruent with traditional [[Taxonomy (biology)|taxonomy]], and are often used to strengthen or correct taxonomic classifications. Sequence comparison is considered a measure robust enough to correct erroneous assumptions in the phylogenetic tree in instances where other evidence is scarce. For example, neutral human DNA sequences are approximately 1.2% divergent (based on substitutions) from those of their nearest genetic relative, the [[chimpanzee]], 1.6% from [[gorilla]]s, and 6.6% from [[baboon]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Chen | first1=F.C. | last2=Li | first2=W.H. |title=Genomic Divergences between Humans and Other Hominoids and the Effective Population Size of the Common Ancestor of Humans and Chimpanzees |journal=American Journal of Human Genetics |volume=68 |issue=2 |pages=444–56 |year=2001 |pmc=1235277 |doi=10.1086/318206 |pmid=11170892 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite journal | last1=Cooper | first1=G.M. | last2=Brudno | first2=M. | last3=Green | first3=E.D. | last4=Batzoglou | first4=S. | last5=Sidow | first5=A. |title=Quantitative Estimates of Sequence Divergence for Comparative Analyses of Mammalian Genomes |journal=Genome Res. |volume=13 |issue=5 |pages=813–20 |year=2003 |pmid=12727901 |pmc=430923 |doi=10.1101/gr.1064503 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Genetic sequence evidence thus allows inference and quantification of genetic relatedness between humans and other [[ape]]s.&lt;ref&gt;The picture labeled "Human Chromosome 2 and its analogs in the apes" in the article [http://www.gate.net/~rwms/hum_ape_chrom.html Comparison of the Human and Great Ape Chromosomes as Evidence for Common Ancestry] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/615A9juxT?url=http://www.gate.net/~rwms/hum_ape_chrom.html |date=2011-08-20 }} is literally a picture of a link in humans that links two separate chromosomes in the nonhuman apes creating a single chromosome in humans. Also, while the term originally referred to fossil evidence, this too is a trace from the past corresponding to some living beings that, when alive, physically embodied this link.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[The New York Times]]'' report ''[https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/07/science/07evolve.html Still Evolving, Human Genes Tell New Story]'', based on ''[http://biology.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0040072 A Map of Recent Positive Selection in the Human Genome]'', states the [[International HapMap Project]] is "providing the strongest evidence yet that humans are still evolving" and details some of that evidence.&lt;/ref&gt; The sequence of the [[16S ribosomal RNA]] gene, a vital gene encoding a part of the [[ribosome]], was used to find the broad phylogenetic relationships between all extant life. The analysis by [[Carl Woese]] resulted in the [[three-domain system]], arguing for two major splits in the early evolution of life. The first split led to modern [[Bacteria]] and the subsequent split led to modern [[Archaea]] and [[Eukaryotes]].

Some DNA sequences are shared by very different organisms. It has been predicted by the theory of evolution that the differences in such DNA sequences between two organisms should roughly resemble both the biological difference between them according to their [[anatomy]] and the time that had passed since these two organisms have separated in the course of evolution, as seen in [[fossil]] evidence. The rate of accumulating such changes should be low for some sequences, namely those that code for critical [[RNA]] or [[protein]]s, and high for others that code for less critical RNA or proteins; but for every specific sequence, the rate of change should be roughly constant over time. These results have been experimentally confirmed. Two examples are DNA sequences coding for [[rRNA]], which is highly conserved, and DNA sequences coding for [[fibrinopeptide]]s ([[amino acid]] chains that are discarded during the formation of [[fibrin]]), which are highly non-conserved.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | first1=Bruce | last1=Alberts | author1-link=Bruce Alberts |first2=Alexander | last2=Johnson |first3=Julian | last3=Lewis |first4=Martin | last4=Raff |first5=Keith | last5=Roberts |first6=Peter | last6=Walter | author6-link=Peter Walter |title=Molecular Biology of the Cell |edition=4th |publisher=Routledge |date=March 2002 |isbn=978-0-8153-3218-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Proteins====

[[Proteome|Proteomic]] evidence also supports the universal ancestry of life. Vital [[protein]]s, such as the [[ribosome]], [[DNA polymerase]], and [[RNA polymerase]], are found in everything from the most primitive bacteria to the most complex mammals. The core part of the protein is conserved across all lineages of life, serving similar functions. Higher organisms have evolved additional [[protein subunit]]s, largely affecting the regulation and [[protein-protein interaction]] of the core. Other overarching similarities between all lineages of extant organisms, such as [[DNA]], [[RNA]], amino acids, and the [[lipid bilayer]], give support to the theory of common descent. Phylogenetic analyses of protein sequences from various organisms produce similar trees of relationship between all organisms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://phylointelligence.org/combined.html "Converging Evidence for Evolution."] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101201081747/http://www.phylointelligence.org/combined.html |date=2010-12-01 }} Phylointelligence: Evolution for Everyone. 26 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[chirality (chemistry)|chirality]] of DNA, RNA, and amino acids is conserved across all known life. As there is no functional advantage to right- or left-handed molecular chirality, the simplest hypothesis is that the choice was made randomly by early organisms and passed on to all extant life through common descent. Further evidence for reconstructing ancestral lineages comes from [[junk DNA]] such as [[pseudogene]]s, "dead" genes that steadily accumulate mutations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Petrov, D.A.; Hartl, D.L. |title=Pseudogene evolution and natural selection for a compact genome |journal=The Journal of Heredity |volume=91 |issue=3 |pages=221–7 |year=2000 |pmid=10833048 |doi=10.1093/jhered/91.3.221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Pseudogenes====

Pseudogenes, also known as [[noncoding DNA]], are extra DNA in a genome that do not get transcribed into RNA to synthesize proteins. Some of this noncoding DNA has known functions, but much of it has no known function and is called "Junk DNA".&lt;ref name="Xiao-Jie 17–24"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Xiao-Jie|first=Lu|last2=Ai-Mei|first2=Gao|last3=Li-Juan|first3=Ji|last4=Jiang|first4=Xu|date=2015-01-01|title=Pseudogene in cancer: real functions and promising signature|url=http://jmg.bmj.com/content/52/1/17|journal=Journal of Medical Genetics|language=en|volume=52|issue=1|pages=17–24|doi=10.1136/jmedgenet-2014-102785|issn=0022-2593|pmid=25391452}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vanin|first=E F|date=1985|title=Processed Pseudogenes: Characteristics and Evolution|journal=Annual Review of Genetics|language=en|volume=19|issue=1|pages=253–272|doi=10.1146/annurev.ge.19.120185.001345|pmid=3909943|issn=0066-4197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://archive.gersteinlab.org/papers/e-print/encodepgenes/preprint.pdf|title=Pseudogenes in the ENCODE Regions: Consensus Annotation, Analysis of Transcription and Evolution|last=Gerstein|first=Mark|date=2006|website=Gerstein Lab|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.news-medical.net/life-sciences/what-is-junk-dna.aspx|title=What is Junk DNA?|date=2010-05-07|work=News-Medical.net|access-date=2018-06-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an example of a vestige since replicating these genes uses energy, making it a waste in many cases. A pseudogene can be produced when a coding gene accumulates mutations that prevent it from being transcribed, making it non-functional.&lt;ref name="Xiao-Jie 17–24"/&gt; But since it is not transcribed, it may disappear without affecting fitness, unless it has provided some beneficial function as non-coding DNA. Non-functional pseudogenes may be passed on to later species, thereby labeling the later species as descended from the earlier species.

====Other mechanisms====

A large body of molecular evidence supports a variety of mechanisms for large evolutionary changes, including: [[genome]] and [[gene duplication]], which facilitates rapid evolution by providing substantial quantities of genetic material under weak or no selective constraints; [[horizontal gene transfer]], the process of transferring genetic material to another cell that is not an organism's offspring, allowing for species to acquire beneficial genes from each other; and [[genetic recombination|recombination]], capable of reassorting large numbers of different [[allele]]s and of establishing [[reproductive isolation]]. The [[endosymbiotic theory]] explains the origin of [[mitochondrion|mitochondria]] and [[plastid]]s (including [[chloroplast]]s), which are [[organelle]]s of eukaryotic cells, as the incorporation of an ancient [[prokaryote|prokaryotic]] cell into ancient [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] cell. Rather than evolving [[eukaryote|eukaryotic]] [[organelle]]s slowly, this theory offers a mechanism for a sudden evolutionary leap by incorporating the genetic material and biochemical composition of a separate species. Evidence supporting this mechanism has been found in the [[protist]] ''[[Hatena arenicola|Hatena]]'': as a [[predator]] it engulfs a [[green alga]]l cell, which subsequently behaves as an [[endosymbiont]], nourishing ''Hatena'', which in turn loses its feeding apparatus and behaves as an [[autotroph]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Okamoto | first1=N. | last2=Inouye | first2=I. |year=2005 | title=A secondary symbiosis in progress |journal=Science |volume=310 |issue=5746 |page=287 |doi=10.1126/science.1116125 |pmid=16224014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Okamoto | first1=N. | last2=Inouye | first2=I. | title=Hatena arenicola gen. et sp. nov., a katablepharid undergoing probable plastid acquisition |journal=Protist |volume=157 |issue=4 |pages=401–19 |year=2006 |pmid=16891155 |doi=10.1016/j.protis.2006.05.011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since [[metabolism|metabolic]] processes do not leave fossils, research into the evolution of the basic cellular processes is done largely by comparison of existing organisms. Many lineages diverged when new metabolic processes appeared, and it is theoretically possible to determine when certain metabolic processes appeared by comparing the traits of the descendants of a common ancestor or by detecting their physical manifestations. As an example, the appearance of [[oxygen]] in the [[earth's atmosphere]] is linked to the evolution of [[photosynthesis]].

===Specific examples from comparative physiology and biochemistry===

====Chromosome 2 in humans====
{{Main|Chromosome 2 (human)}}
{{further|Chimpanzee Genome Project#Genes of the Chromosome 2 fusion site}}
[[File:Chromosome 2 merge en.svg|thumb|'''Figure 1b: '''Fusion of ancestral chromosomes left distinctive remnants of telomeres, and a vestigial centromere]]

Evidence for the evolution of ''Homo sapiens'' from a common ancestor with chimpanzees is found in the number of chromosomes in humans as compared to all other members of [[Hominidae]]. All hominidae have 24 pairs of chromosomes, except humans, who have only 23 pairs. Human chromosome 2 is a result of an end-to-end fusion of two ancestral chromosomes.&lt;ref name="fusion"&gt;MacAndrew, Alec. [http://www.evolutionpages.com/chromosome_2.htm Human Chromosome 2 is a fusion of two ancestral chromosomes]. Accessed 18 May 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=x-WAHpC0Ah0 Evidence of Common Ancestry: Human Chromosome 2] (video) 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

The evidence for this includes:

* The correspondence of chromosome 2 to two ape chromosomes. The closest human relative, the [[common chimpanzee]], has near-identical DNA sequences to human chromosome 2, but they are found in two separate chromosomes. The same is true of the more distant [[gorilla]] and [[orangutan]].&lt;ref name="compare"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Yunis | first1=J.J. | title=The origin of man: a chromosomal pictorial legacy | journal=Science | year=1982 | pages=1525–1530 | volume=215 | pmid=7063861 | doi=10.1126/science.7063861 | last2=Prakash | first2=O. | issue=4539|bibcode=1982Sci...215.1525Y | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="similarities"&gt;[http://www.gate.net/~rwms/hum_ape_chrom.html Human and Ape Chromosomes] {{webarchive|url=https://www.webcitation.org/615A9juxT?url=http://www.gate.net/~rwms/hum_ape_chrom.html |date=2011-08-20 }}; accessed 8 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The presence of a [[Vestigial structure|vestigial]] [[centromere]]. Normally a chromosome has just one centromere, but in chromosome 2 there are remnants of a second centromere.&lt;ref name="centromeres"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Evidence for an ancestral alphoid domain on the long arm of human chromosome 2 | journal=Human Genetics | year=1992 | pages=247–9 | volume=89 | pmid=1587535 | doi=10.1007/BF00217134 | last2=Pedicini | first2=A | last3=Caiulo | first3=A | last4=Zuffardi | first4=O | last5=Fraccaro | first5=M | issue=2 |last1=Avarello |first1=Rosamaria |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The presence of vestigial [[telomere]]s. These are normally found only at the ends of a chromosome, but in chromosome 2 there are additional telomere sequences in the middle.&lt;ref name="telomeres"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Origin of human chromosome 2: an ancestral telomere-telomere fusion | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences | year=1991 | pages=9051–5 | volume=88 | pmid=1924367 | doi=10.1073/pnas.88.20.9051 | last2=Baldini | first2=A | last3=Ward | first3=DC | last4=Reeders | first4=ST | last5=Wells | first5=RA | issue=20 | pmc=52649 |last1=Ijdo |first1=J. W.|bibcode=1991PNAS...88.9051I |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chromosome 2 thus presents strong evidence in favour of the common descent of humans and other [[ape]]s. According to J. W. Ijdo, "We conclude that the locus cloned in cosmids c8.1 and c29B is the relic of an ancient telomere-telomere fusion and marks the point at which two ancestral ape chromosomes fused to give rise to human chromosome 2."&lt;ref name="telomeres"/&gt;

====Cytochrome c and b====
{{Main|Cytochrome c}}

A classic example of biochemical evidence for evolution is the variance of the ubiquitous (i.e. all living organisms have it, because it performs very basic life functions) [[protein]] [[Cytochrome c]] in living cells. The variance of cytochrome c of different organisms is measured in the number of differing amino acids, each differing amino acid being a result of a [[base pair]] substitution, a [[mutation]]. If each differing amino acid is assumed the result of one base pair substitution, it can be calculated how long ago the two species diverged by multiplying the number of base pair substitutions by the estimated time it takes for a substituted base pair of the cytochrome c gene to be successfully passed on. For example, if the average time it takes for a base pair of the cytochrome c gene to mutate is N years, the number of amino acids making up the cytochrome c protein in monkeys differ by one from that of humans, this leads to the conclusion that the two species diverged N years ago.

The primary structure of cytochrome c consists of a chain of about 100 [[amino acid]]s. Many higher order organisms possess a chain of 104 amino acids.&lt;ref name="indiana"&gt;[http://www.indiana.edu/~ensiweb/lessons/molb.ws.pdf Amino acid sequences in cytochrome c proteins from different species], adapted from Strahler, Arthur; Science and Earth History, 1997. page 348.&lt;/ref&gt;

The cytochrome c molecule has been extensively studied for the glimpse it gives into evolutionary biology. Both [[chicken]] and [[turkey (bird)|turkey]]s have identical sequence homology (amino acid for amino acid), as do [[pig]]s, [[cow]]s and [[sheep]]. Both [[human]]s and [[chimpanzee]]s share the identical molecule, while [[rhesus monkey]]s share all but one of the amino acids:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Lurquin | first1=P.F. | last2=Stone | first2=L. | title=Genes, Culture, and Human Evolution: A Synthesis |publisher=Blackwell Publishing, Incorporated |year=2006 |page=79 |isbn=978-1-4051-5089-7 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zdeWdF_NQhEC&amp;pg=PA79&amp;lpg=PA79&amp;dq=chimpanzee+rhesus+cytochrome+c}}&lt;/ref&gt; the 66th amino acid is [[isoleucine]] in the former and [[threonine]] in the latter.&lt;ref name="indiana"/&gt;

What makes these homologous similarities particularly suggestive of common ancestry in the case of cytochrome c, in addition to the fact that the phylogenies derived from them match other phylogenies very well, is the high degree of functional redundancy of the cytochrome c molecule. The different existing configurations of amino acids do not significantly affect the functionality of the protein, which indicates that the base pair substitutions are not part of a directed design, but the result of random mutations that aren't subject to selection.&lt;ref name="29+ evidences"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section4.html#protein_redundancy |title=29+ Evidences for Macroevolution; Protein functional redundancy] |first=Douglas |last=Theobald |date=2004 |website=The Talk Origins Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Cytochrome b is commonly used as a region of [[mitochondrial DNA]] to determine [[phylogenetic]] relationships between organisms due to its sequence variability. It is considered most useful in determining relationships within [[Family (biology)|families]] and [[Genus|genera]]. Comparative studies involving cytochrome b have resulted in new classification schemes and have been used to assign newly described species to a genus, as well as deepen the understanding of evolutionary relationships.&lt;ref name="2001Castresana"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Castresana | first1=J. | title=Cytochrome ''b'' Phylogeny and the Taxonomy of Great Apes and Mammals | journal=Molecular Biology and Evolution | volume=18 | pages=465–471 | year=2001 | url=http://mbe.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/reprint/18/4/465 | pmid=11264397 | issue=4 | doi=10.1093/oxfordjournals.molbev.a003825}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Endogenous retroviruses====
[[Endogenous retrovirus]]es (or ERVs) are remnant sequences in the genome left from ancient viral infections in an organism. The retroviruses (or virogenes) are always [[heredity|passed on]] to the next generation of that organism that received the infection. This leaves the virogene left in the genome. Because this event is rare and random, finding identical chromosomal positions of a virogene in two different species suggests common ancestry.&lt;ref name="29+ evidences"/&gt; Cats ([[Felidae]]) present a notable instance of virogene sequences demonstrating common descent. The standard phylogenetic tree for Felidae have smaller cats (''[[Felis chaus]]'', ''[[Felis silvestris]]'', ''[[Felis nigripes]]'', and ''[[Felis catus]]'') diverging from larger cats such as the subfamily [[Pantherinae]] and other [[Carnivora|carnivores]]. The fact that small cats have an ERV where the larger cats do not suggests that the gene was inserted into the ancestor of the small cats after the larger cats had diverged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Discovery of a New Endogenous Type C Retrovirus (FcEV) in Cats: Evidence for RD-114 Being an FcEVGag-Pol/Baboon Endogenous Virus BaEVEnv Recombinant| journal=Journal of Virology| year=1999| volume=73| pmid=10482547| issue=10 | last1=Van Der Kuyl | first1=A.C. | last2=Dekker | first2=J.T. | last3=Goudsmit | first3= J. | pages= 7994–8002 | pmc= 112814}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another example of this is with humans and chimps.

====Recent African origin of modern humans====
{{Main|Recent single-origin hypothesis}}
{{See also|Human mitochondrial DNA haplogroup|Human Y-chromosome DNA haplogroup}}
Mathematical models of evolution, pioneered by the likes of [[Sewall Wright]], [[Ronald Fisher]] and [[J. B. S. Haldane]] and extended via [[diffusion equation|diffusion theory]] by [[Motoo Kimura]], allow predictions about the genetic structure of evolving populations. Direct examination of the genetic structure of modern populations via DNA sequencing has allowed verification of many of these predictions. For example, the [[Recent single-origin hypothesis|Out of Africa]] theory of human origins, which states that modern humans developed in Africa and a small sub-population migrated out (undergoing a [[population bottleneck]]), implies that modern populations should show the signatures of this migration pattern. Specifically, post-bottleneck populations (Europeans and Asians) should show lower overall genetic diversity and a more uniform distribution of allele frequencies compared to the African population. Both of these predictions are borne out by actual data from a number of studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Pallen | first=Mark | title=Rough Guide to Evolution|publisher=Rough Guides|year=2009 |pages=200–206|isbn=978-1-85828-946-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence from comparative anatomy==
[[Comparative anatomy|Comparative study of the anatomy]] of groups of animals or plants reveals that certain structural features are basically similar. For example, the basic structure of all [[flower]]s consists of [[sepal]]s, [[petal]]s, [[Gynoecium|stigma, style and ovary]]; yet the size, [[colour]], [[number]] of parts and specific structure are different for each individual species. The neural anatomy of fossilized remains may also be compared using advanced imaging techniques.&lt;ref name="journal nature"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Tanaka, G.; Hou, X.; Ma, X.; Edgecombe, G.D.; Strausfeld, N.J. |title=Chelicerate neural ground pattern in a Cambrian great appendage arthropod |journal=Nature |volume=502 |issue=7471 |pages=364–367 |date=October 2013 |pmid=24132294 |doi=10.1038/nature12520 |bibcode=2013Natur.502..364T }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolutionary developmental biology and embryonic development===
{{Main|Evolutionary developmental biology}}
{{See also|Embryogenesis}}
Evolutionary developmental biology is the biological field that compares the developmental process of different organisms to determine ancestral relationships between species. A large variety of organism's genomes contain a [[Evolutionary developmental biology#The developmental-genetic toolkit|small fraction of genes]] that control the organisms development. [[Hox genes]] are an example of these types of nearly universal genes in organisms pointing to an origin of common ancestry. Embryological evidence comes from the development of organisms at the embryological level with the comparison of different organisms embryos similarity. Remains of ancestral traits often appear and disappear in different stages of the embryological development process.

Some examples include:
* Hair growth and loss ([[lanugo]]) during human development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s11692-010-9085-4 |title=The Evo-Devo Puzzle of Human Hair Patterning |year=2010 |last1=Held |first1=Lewis I. |journal=Evolutionary Biology |volume=37 |issue=2–3 |pages=113–122}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Development and degeneration of a [[yolk sac]].
* Terrestrial frogs and [[salamander]]s passing through the larval stage within the egg—with features of typically aquatic larvae—but hatch ready for life on land;&lt;ref name="Douglas J. Futuyma 1998 122"&gt;{{cite book | title=Evolutionary Biology| edition=3rd| first=Douglas J. | last=Futuyma | year=1998| page=122| publisher=Sinauer Associates Inc.| isbn=978-0-87893-189-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* The appearance of gill-like structures ([[pharyngeal arch]]) in vertebrate embryo development. Note that in fish, the arches continue to develop as [[branchial arch]]es while in humans, for example, they give rise to a [[Pharyngeal arch#Specific arches|variety of structures]] within the head and neck.

===Homologous structures and divergent (adaptive) evolution===
If widely separated groups of organisms are originated from a common ancestry, they are expected to have certain basic features in common. The degree of resemblance between two organisms should indicate how closely related they are in evolution:
* Groups with little in common are assumed to have diverged from a [[common ancestor]] much earlier in geological history than groups with a lot in common;
* In deciding how closely related two animals are, a comparative anatomist looks for [[structure]]s that are fundamentally similar, even though they may serve different functions in the [[adult]]. Such structures are described as [[Homology (biology)|homologous]] and suggest a common origin.
* In cases where the similar structures serve different functions in adults, it may be necessary to trace their origin and [[Embryogenesis|embryonic development]]. A similar developmental origin suggests they are the same structure, and thus likely derived from a common ancestor.

When a group of organisms share a homologous structure that is specialized to perform a variety of functions to adapt different environmental conditions and modes of life, it is called [[adaptive radiation]]. The gradual spreading of organisms with adaptive radiation is known as [[divergent evolution]].

===Nested hierarchies and classification===
[[Biological classification|Taxonomy]] is based on the fact that all organisms are related to each other in nested hierarchies based on shared characteristics. Most existing species can be organized rather easily in a nested hierarchical classification. This is evident from the Linnaean classification scheme. Based on shared derived characters, closely related organisms can be placed in one group (such as a genus), several genera can be grouped together into one family, several families can be grouped together into an order, etc.&lt;ref name="talkorigins.org"&gt;[http://www.talkorigins.org/faqs/comdesc/section1.html#nested_hierarchy 29+ Evidences for Macroevolution: Part 1]. Talkorigins.org. Retrieved on 2011-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt; The existence of these nested hierarchies was recognized by many biologists before Darwin, but he showed that his theory of evolution with its branching pattern of common descent could explain them.&lt;ref name="talkorigins.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Coyne | first=Jerry A. |authorlink=Jerry A. Coyne |title=Why Evolution is True|publisher=Viking|year=2009 |pages=8–11|isbn=978-0-670-02053-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin described how common descent could provide a logical basis for classification:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= On the Origin of Species | authorlink=Charles Darwin | first=Charles | last=Darwin | year=1859| page=420| publisher= John Murray }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{cquote|All the foregoing rules and aids and difficulties in classification are explained, if I do not greatly deceive myself, on the view that the natural system is founded on descent with modification; that the characters which naturalists consider as showing true affinity between any two or more species, are those which have been inherited from a common parent, and, in so far, all true classification is genealogical; that community of descent is the hidden bond which naturalists have been unconsciously seeking,&amp;nbsp;... |30px|30px|[[Charles Darwin]]|''[[On the Origin of Species]]'', page 577}}

====Evolutionary trees====
An [[evolutionary tree]] (of Amniota, for example, the last common ancestor of mammals and reptiles, and all its descendants) illustrates the initial conditions causing evolutionary patterns of similarity (e.g., all Amniotes produce an egg that possesses the [[Amnios (biology)|amnios]]) and the patterns of divergence amongst lineages (e.g., mammals and reptiles branching from the common ancestry in Amniota). Evolutionary trees provide conceptual models of evolving systems once thought limited in the domain of making predictions out of the theory.&lt;ref name="Tuomi81" &gt;{{cite journal | last1=Tuomi | first1=J. | title=Structure and dynamics of Darwinian evolutionary theory | journal=Syst. Zool. | volume=30 | issue=1 | pages=22–31 | url=http://www.vordenker.de/downloads/tuomi_structure-dynamics-Darwinian-evolutionary-theory.pdf | doi=10.2307/2992299 | year=1981| jstor=2992299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the method of [[phylogenetic bracketing]] is used to infer predictions with far greater probability than raw speculation. For example, paleontologists use this technique to make predictions about nonpreservable traits in fossil organisms, such as feathered dinosaurs, and molecular biologists use the technique to posit predictions about RNA metabolism and protein functions.&lt;ref name="Aravind03"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Aravind, L.; Iyer, L.M.; Anantharaman, V. |title=The two faces of Alba: the evolutionary connection between proteins participating in chromatin structure and RNA metabolism |journal=Genome Biology |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=R64 |year=2003 |pmid=14519199 |pmc=328453 |doi=10.1186/gb-2003-4-10-r64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Brochu09"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Brochu | first1=C.

Evolutionary biologists test evolutionary theory using phylogenetic systematic methods that measure how much the hypothesis (a particular branching pattern in an evolutionary tree) increases the likelihood of the evidence (the distribution of characters among lineages).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bock | first1=W.

===Vestigial structures===
{{Main|Vestigiality}}
{{See also|Human vestigiality}}
Evidence for common descent comes from the existence of vestigial structures.&lt;ref name=Slifkin258_9&gt;{{cite book | first=Natan | last=Slifkin |title=The Challenge of Creation… |publisher=Zoo Torah |year=2006 |pages=258–9 |isbn=978-1-933143-15-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; These rudimentary structures are often homologous to structures that correspond in related or ancestral species. A wide range of structures exist such as mutated and non-functioning genes, parts of a flower, muscles, organs, and even behaviors. This variety can be found across many different groups of species. In many cases they are degenerated or underdeveloped. The existence of vestigial organs can be explained in terms of changes in the environment or modes of life of the species. Those organs are typically functional in the ancestral species but are now either semi-functional, nonfunctional, or re-purposed.

Scientific literature concerning vestigial structures abounds. One study complied 64 examples of vestigial structures found in the literature across a wide range of disciplines within the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Vestigial Biological Structures: A Classroom-Applicable Test of Creationist Hypotheses| author=Senter, Phil | journal=The American Biology Teacher| year=2015| volume=77| issue=2| pages=99–106| doi=10.1525/abt.2015.77.2.4|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following non-exhaustive list summarizes Senter et al. alongside various other examples:

====Insect mouthparts and appendages====
Many different species of insects have mouthparts derived from the same embryonic structures, indicating that the mouthparts are modifications of a common ancestor's original features. These include a [[Insect mouthparts#Labrum|labrum]] (upper lip), a pair of [[mandible (insect)|mandible]]s, a [[hypopharynx]] (floor of mouth), a pair of [[Maxilla (arthropod mouthpart)#Hexapoda|maxillae]], and a [[labium (insect)|labium]]. (Fig. 2c) Evolution has caused enlargement and modification of these structures in some species, while it has caused the reduction and loss of them in other species. The modifications enable the insects to exploit a variety of food materials.

Insect mouthparts and antennae are considered homologues of insect legs. Parallel developments are seen in some [[arachnid]]s: The anterior pair of legs may be modified as analogues of antennae, particularly in [[uropygid|whip scorpions]], which walk on six legs. These developments provide support for the theory that complex modifications often arise by duplication of components, with the duplicates modified in different directions.

====Pelvic structure of dinosaurs====
{{See also|Evolution of dinosaurs|Evolution of birds}}
Similar to the pentadactyl limb in mammals, the earliest [[dinosaurs]] split into two distinct orders—the ''[[saurischia]]'' and ''[[ornithischia]]''. They are classified as one or the other in accordance with what the fossils demonstrate. Figure 2d, shows that early ''saurischians'' resembled early ''ornithischians''. The pattern of the [[pelvis]] in all species of dinosaurs is an example of homologous structures. Each order of dinosaur has slightly differing pelvis bones providing evidence of common descent. Additionally, modern [[birds]] show a similarity to ancient ''saurischian'' pelvic structures indicating the [[evolution of birds]] from dinosaurs. This can also be seen in Figure 5c as the [[Aves]] branch off the [[Theropoda]] suborder.

====Pentadactyl limb====
{{further|Evolution of mammals}}
The pattern of limb bones called [[pentadactyl limb]] is an example of homologous structures (Fig. 2e). It is found in all classes of [[tetrapod]]s (''i.e.'' from [[amphibian]]s to [[mammal]]s). It can even be traced back to the [[Fish fin|fins]] of certain [[fossil fish]]es from which the first amphibians evolved such as [[tiktaalik]]. The limb has a single proximal bone ([[humerus]]), two distal bones ([[Radius (bone)|radius]] and [[ulna]]), a series of [[carpal]]s ([[wrist]] bones), followed by five series of metacarpals ([[hand|palm]] bones) and [[Phalanx bone|phalanges]] (digits). Throughout the tetrapods, the fundamental structures of pentadactyl limbs are the same, indicating that they originated from a common ancestor. But in the course of evolution, these fundamental structures have been modified. They have become superficially different and unrelated structures to serve different functions in adaptation to different environments and modes of life. This phenomenon is shown in the forelimbs of mammals. For example:
* In [[monkey]]s, the forelimbs are much elongated, forming a grasping hand used for climbing and swinging among trees.
* [[Pig]]s have lost their first digit, while the second and fifth digits are reduced. The remaining two digits are longer and stouter than the rest and bear a hoof for supporting the body.
* In horses, the forelimbs are highly adapted for strength and support. Fast and long-distance running is possible due to the extensive elongation of the third digit that bears a hoof.
* The [[mole (animal)|mole]] has a pair of short, spade-like forelimbs for [[burrowing]].
* [[Anteater]]s use their enlarged third digit for tearing into [[ant]] and [[termite]] nests.
* In cetaceans, the forelimbs become [[flipper (anatomy)|flipper]]s for steering and maintaining equilibrium during swimming.
* In [[bat]]s, the forelimbs have become highly modified and evolved into functioning [[wing]]s. Four digits have become elongated, while the hook-like first digit remains free and is used to hang upside down.

====Recurrent laryngeal nerve in giraffes====
The [[recurrent laryngeal nerve]] is a fourth branch of the [[vagus nerve]], which is a [[cranial nerve]]. In mammals, its path is unusually long. As a part of the vagus nerve, it comes from the brain, passes through the neck down to heart, rounds the [[dorsal aorta]] and returns up to the [[larynx]], again through the neck. (Fig. 2f)

This path is suboptimal even for humans, but for [[giraffes]] it becomes even more suboptimal. Due to the lengths of their necks, the recurrent laryngeal nerve may be up to {{convert|4|m|ft|abbr=on}} long, despite its optimal route being a distance of just several inches.

The indirect route of this nerve is the result of evolution of mammals from fish, which had no neck and had a relatively short nerve that innervated one gill slit and passed near the gill arch. Since then, the gill it innervated has become the larynx and the gill arch has become the dorsal aorta in mammals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first=Mark | last=Ridley |edition=3rd |publisher=Blackwell Publishing |year=2004 |page=282 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=b-HGB9PqXCUC&amp;lpg=RA1-PA281|isbn=978-1-4051-0345-9 |title=Evolution |authorlink=Mark Ridley (zoologist)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dawkins, Richard 2009 364–365"&gt;{{cite book | title=The Greatest Show on Earth: The Evidence for Evolution | authorlink=Richard Dawkins | last=Dawkins | first=Richard |year= 2009| pages=364–365| publisher=Bantam Press | isbn= 978-1-4165-9478-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Route of the vas deferens====
Similar to the laryngeal nerve in giraffes, the [[vas deferens]] is part of the [[male reproductive system|male anatomy]] of many [[vertebrates]]; it transports sperm from the [[epididymis]] in anticipation of [[ejaculation]]. In humans, the vas deferens routes up from the [[testicle]], looping over the [[ureter]], and back down to the [[urethra]] and [[penis]]. It has been suggested that this is due to the descent of the testicles during the course of human evolution—likely associated with temperature. As the testicles descended, the vas deferens lengthened to accommodate the accidental "hook" over the ureter.&lt;ref name="Dawkins, Richard 2009 364–365"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Natural selection: domains, levels, and challenges | last=Williams | first=G.C.| year=1992| publisher=Oxford Press | isbn=978-0-19-506932-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When organisms die, they often [[decomposition|decompose]] rapidly or are consumed by [[scavenger]]s, leaving no permanent evidences of their existence. However, occasionally, some organisms are preserved. The remains or [[trace fossil|traces]] of organisms from a past [[geologic time scale|geologic age]] embedded in [[rock (geology)|rocks]] by natural processes are called [[fossil]]s. They are extremely important for understanding the [[timeline of evolution|evolutionary history of life]] on Earth, as they provide direct evidence of evolution and detailed information on the ancestry of organisms. [[Paleontology]] is the study of past life based on fossil records and their relations to different geologic time periods.

For fossilization to take place, the traces and remains of organisms must be quickly buried so that [[weathering]] and decomposition do not occur. Skeletal structures or other hard parts of the organisms are the most commonly occurring form of fossilized remains. There are also some trace "fossils" showing [[molding (process)|moulds]], cast or imprints of some previous organisms.

As an animal dies, the organic materials gradually decay, such that the [[bone]]s become porous. If the animal is subsequently buried in [[mud]], [[mineral]] salts infiltrate into the bones and gradually fill up the pores. The bones harden into stones and are preserved as fossils. This process is known as [[petrifaction|petrification]]. If dead animals are covered by wind-blown [[sand]], and if the sand is subsequently turned into mud by heavy [[rain]] or [[flood]]s, the same process of mineral infiltration may occur. Apart from petrification, the dead bodies of organisms may be well preserved in [[ice]], in hardened [[resin]] of [[pinophyta|coniferous]] trees (figure 3a), in tar, or in anaerobic, [[acid]]ic [[peat]]. Fossilization can sometimes be a trace, an impression of a form. Examples include leaves and footprints, the fossils of which are made in layers that then harden.

===Fossil record===
It is possible to decipher how a particular group of organisms evolved by arranging its fossil record in a chronological sequence. Such a sequence can be determined because fossils are mainly found in [[sedimentary rock]]. Sedimentary rock is formed by layers of [[silt]] or mud on top of each other; thus, the resulting rock contains a series of horizontal layers, or [[stratum|strata]]. Each layer contains fossils typical for a specific [[period (geology)|time period]] when they formed. The lowest strata contain the oldest rock and the earliest fossils, while the highest strata contain the youngest rock and more recent fossils.

A succession of animals and plants can also be seen from fossil discoveries. By studying the number and complexity of different fossils at different [[stratigraphy|stratigraphic]] levels, it has been shown that older fossil-bearing rocks contain fewer types of fossilized organisms, and they all have a simpler structure, whereas younger rocks contain a greater variety of fossils, often with increasingly complex structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last=Coyne | first=Jerry A. |authorlink=Jerry A. Coyne |title=Why Evolution is True|publisher=Viking|year=2009 |pages=26–28|isbn=978-0-670-02053-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years, geologists could only roughly estimate the ages of various strata and the fossils found. They did so, for instance, by estimating the time for the formation of sedimentary rock layer by layer. Today, by measuring the proportions of [[radioactive decay|radioactive]] and stable [[chemical element|elements]] in a given rock, the ages of fossils can be more precisely dated by scientists. This technique is known as [[radiometric dating]].

Throughout the fossil record, many species that appear at an early stratigraphic level disappear at a later level. This is interpreted in evolutionary terms as indicating the times when species originated and became extinct. Geographical regions and climatic conditions have varied throughout [[History of Earth|Earth's history]]. Since organisms are adapted to particular environments, the constantly changing conditions favoured species that adapted to new environments through the mechanism of [[natural selection]].

====Extent of the fossil record====
{{See also|Transitional fossil|List of transitional fossils}}
Despite the relative rarity of suitable conditions for fossilization, an estimated 250,000 fossil species have been named.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Bringing Fossils to Life: An Introduction to Paleobiology | edition=3rd | author=Donald R. Prothero | date=2013 | pages=21 | publisher=Columbia University Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of individual fossils this represents varies greatly from species to species, but many millions of fossils have been recovered: for instance, more than three million fossils from the last [[ice age]] have been recovered from the [[La Brea Tar Pits]] in Los Angeles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tarpits.org/info/faq/faqfossil.html |title=Frequently Asked Questions |accessdate=2011-02-21 |publisher=The Natural History Museum of Los Angeles County Foundation |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110311233346/http://www.tarpits.org/info/faq/faqfossil.html |archivedate=2011-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many more fossils are still in the ground, in various geological formations known to contain a high fossil density, allowing estimates of the total fossil content of the formation to be made. An example of this occurs in South Africa's [[Beaufort Formation]] (part of the [[Karoo Supergroup]], which covers most of South Africa), which is rich in vertebrate fossils, including [[therapsid]]s (reptile-mammal [[Transitional fossil|transitional forms]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The Karoo: Ecological Patterns and Processes| first1=William Richard John | last1=Dean | first2=Suzanne Jane | last2=Milton| year=1999| page=31| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=978-0-521-55450-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been estimated that this formation contains 800 billion vertebrate fossils.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Six "Flood" Arguments Creationists Can't Answer| first=Robert J. | last=Schadewald| journal=Creation Evolution Journal| year=1982| volume=3| pages=12–17| url=http://ncseprojects.org/cej/3/3/six-flood-arguments-creationists-cant-answer | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Palentologists have documented numerous transitional forms and have constructed "an astonishingly comprehensive record of the key transitions in animal evolution".&lt;ref name="DRProthero"&gt;{{Citation | title=What missing link?| author=Donald R.

===Limitations===
The fossil record is an important source for scientists when tracing the evolutionary history of organisms. However, because of limitations inherent in the record, there are not fine scales of intermediate forms between related groups of species. This lack of continuous fossils in the record is a major limitation in tracing the descent of biological groups. When [[transitional fossil]]s are found that show intermediate forms in what had previously been a gap in knowledge, they are often popularly referred to as "missing links".

There is a gap of about 100 million years between the beginning of the [[Cambrian]] period and the end of the [[Ordovician]] period. The early Cambrian period was the period from which numerous fossils of [[sponge]]s, [[cnidaria]]ns (''e.g.'', [[jellyfish]]), [[echinoderm]]s (''e.g.'', [[eocrinoid]]s), [[mollusca|molluscs]] (''e.g.'', [[snail]]s) and [[arthropod]]s (''e.g.'', [[trilobite]]s) are found. The first animal that possessed the typical features of [[vertebrate]]s, the ''[[Arandaspis]]'', was dated to have existed in the later Ordovician period. Thus few, if any, fossils of an intermediate type between [[invertebrate]]s and vertebrates have been found, although likely candidates include the [[Burgess Shale]] animal, ''[[Pikaia gracilens]]'',&lt;ref&gt;"Obviously vertebrates must have had ancestors living in the Cambrian, but they were assumed to be invertebrate forerunners of the true vertebrates — protochordates. Pikaia has been heavily promoted as the oldest fossil protochordate."

Some of the reasons for the incompleteness of fossil records are:
* In general, the probability that an organism becomes fossilized is very low;
* Some species or groups are less likely to become fossils because they are soft-bodied;
* Some species or groups are less likely to become fossils because they live (and die) in conditions that are not favourable for fossilization;
* Many fossils have been destroyed through erosion and tectonic movements;
* Most fossils are fragmentary;
* Some evolutionary change occurs in populations at the limits of a species' ecological range, and as these populations are likely small, the probability of fossilization is lower (see [[punctuated equilibrium]]);
* Similarly, when environmental conditions change, the population of a species is likely to be greatly reduced, such that any evolutionary change induced by these new conditions is less likely to be fossilized;
* Most fossils convey information about external form, but little about how the organism functioned;
* Using present-day [[biodiversity]] as a guide, this suggests that the fossils unearthed represent only a small fraction of the large number of species of organisms that lived in the past.

===Specific examples from paleontology===

====Evolution of the horse====
[[File:Horseevolution.png|325px|thumb|left|'''Figure 3e:''' [[Evolution of the horse]] showing reconstruction of the fossil species obtained from successive rock strata. The foot diagrams are all front views of the left forefoot. The third [[Metacarpus|metacarpal]] is shaded throughout. The teeth are shown in longitudinal section. The linear sequence is just one of many paths in the equine phylogenetic tree&lt;!-- and does not imply a direction to evolution--&gt;.]]

{{Main|Evolution of the horse}}
Due to an almost-complete fossil record found in North American sedimentary deposits from the early [[Eocene]] to the present, the [[horse]] provides one of the best examples of evolutionary history ([[phylogeny]]).

This evolutionary sequence starts with a small animal called ''[[Hyracotherium]]'' (commonly referred to as ''Eohippus''), which lived in North America about 54 million years ago then spread across to [[Europe]] and [[Asia]]. Fossil remains of ''Hyracotherium'' show it to have differed from the modern horse in three important respects: it was a small animal (the size of a [[fox]]), lightly built and adapted for running; the limbs were short and slender, and the feet elongated so that the digits were almost vertical, with four digits in the [[forelimb]]s and three digits in the [[hindlimb]]s; and the [[incisor]]s were small, the [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]s having low crowns with rounded [[Cusp (dentistry)|cusp]]s covered in [[Tooth enamel|enamel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Legendre|first=Serge|title=Les communautés de mammifères du Paléogène (Eocène supérieur et Oligocène) d'Europe occidentale : structures, milieux et évolution|year=1989|publisher=F. Pfeil|location=München|isbn=978-3-923871-35-3|page=110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The probable course of development of horses from ''Hyracotherium'' to ''Equus'' (the modern horse) involved at least 12 [[genus|genera]] and several hundred [[species]]. The major trends seen in the development of the horse to changing environmental conditions may be summarized as follows:
* Increase in size (from 0.4&amp;nbsp;m to 1.5&amp;nbsp;m&amp;nbsp;— from 15&amp;nbsp;in to 60&amp;nbsp;in);
* Lengthening of limbs and feet;
* Reduction of lateral digits;
* Increase in length and thickness of the third digit;
* Increase in width of [[incisor]]s;
* Replacement of [[premolar]]s by [[Molar (tooth)|molar]]s; and
* Increases in tooth length, crown height of molars.

Fossilized plants found in different strata show that the [[marsh]]y, wooded country in which ''Hyracotherium'' lived became gradually drier. Survival now depended on the head being in an elevated position for gaining a good view of the surrounding countryside, and on a high turn of speed for escape from [[predation|predators]], hence the increase in size and the replacement of the splayed-out foot by the hoofed foot. The drier, harder ground would make the original splayed-out foot unnecessary for support. The changes in the teeth can be explained by assuming that the diet changed from soft [[vegetation]] to [[grass]]. A dominant genus from each geological period has been selected (see figure 3e) to show the slow alteration of the horse lineage from its ancestral to its modern form.&lt;ref name=Leidy&gt;[http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy/paleo/equus.php Academy of Natural Sciences - Joseph Leidy - American Horses] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305215318/http://www.ansp.org/museum/leidy/paleo/equus.php |date=2012-03-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Transition from fish to amphibians====
Prior to 2004, paleontologists had found fossils of amphibians with necks, ears, and four legs, in rock no older than 365 million years old. In rocks more than 385 million years old they could only find fish, without these amphibian characteristics. Evolutionary theory predicted that since amphibians evolved from fish, an intermediate form should be found in rock dated between 365 and 385 million years ago. Such an intermediate form should have many fish-like characteristics, conserved from 385 million years ago or more, but also have many amphibian characteristics as well. In 2004, an expedition to islands in the Canadian arctic searching specifically for this fossil form in rocks that were 375 million years old discovered fossils of [[Tiktaalik]].&lt;ref name=Shubin&gt;"{{cite book | last=Shubin | first=Neil |title=Your Inner Fish |publisher=Pantheon |location= |year= 2008|pages= |isbn=978-0-375-42447-2 |oclc= |doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some years later, however, scientists in [[Poland]] found evidence of fossilised [[tetrapod]] tracks predating ''Tiktaalik''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Niedzwiedzki | first1=G. | last2=Szrek | first2=P. | last3=Narkiewicz | first3=K. | last4=Narkiewicz | first4=M. | last5=Ahlberg | first5=P. | year=2010 | title=Tetrapod trackways from the early Middle Devonian period of Poland | url=| journal=Nature | volume=463 | issue=7227| pages=43–48 | bibcode=2010Natur.463...43N | doi=10.1038/nature08623 | ref=harv | pmid=20054388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence from biogeography==
Data about the presence or absence of species on various [[continent]]s and [[island]]s ([[biogeography]]) can provide evidence of common descent and shed light on patterns of [[speciation]].

===Continental distribution===
All organisms are adapted to their environment to a greater or lesser extent. If the abiotic and biotic factors within a [[habitat (ecology)|habitat]] are capable of supporting a particular species in one geographic area, then one might assume that the same species would be found in a similar habitat in a similar geographic area, e.g. in [[Africa]] and [[South America]]. This is not the case. Plant and animal species are discontinuously distributed throughout the world:
* Africa has [[Old World monkey]]s, [[ape]]s, [[elephant]]s, [[leopard]]s, [[giraffe]]s, and [[hornbill]]s.
* South America has [[New World monkey]]s, [[cougar]]s, [[jaguar]]s, [[sloth]]s, [[llama]]s, and [[toucan]]s.
* Deserts in North and South America have native [[cacti]], but deserts in Africa, Asia, and Australia have [[succulent]] (apart from ''[[Rhipsalis baccifera]]'')&lt;ref name=CotaBomf10&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cota-Sánchez |first=J. Hugo |last2=Bomfim-Patrício |first2=Márcia C. |year=2010 |title=Seed morphology, polyploidy and the evolutionary history of the epiphytic cactus ''Rhipsalis baccifera'' (Cactaceae) |journal=Polibotanica |volume=29 |pages=107–129 |url=http://www.herbarium.usask.ca/research/articles/Cota-Sanchez_Bomfim-Patricio_Polibotanica_2010.pdf |accessdate=2013-02-28 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; which are native [[euphorbiaceae|euphorbs]] that resemble cacti but are very different.

Even greater differences can be found if [[Australia]] is taken into consideration, though it occupies the same [[latitude]] as much of South America and Africa. [[Marsupial]]s like [[kangaroo]]s, [[bandicoots]], and [[quoll]]s make up about half of Australia's indigenous mammal species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Menkhorst |first1=Peter |last2=Knight |first2=Frank |title=A Field Guide to the Mammals of Australia |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2001 |isbn=978-0-19-550870-3 |page=14}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, marsupials are today totally absent from Africa and form a smaller portion of the mammalian fauna of South America, where [[opossum]]s, [[shrew opossum]]s, and the [[monito del monte]] occur. The only living representatives of primitive egg-laying mammals ([[monotreme]]s) are the [[echidna]]s and the [[platypus]]. The short-beaked echidna (''[[Tachyglossus aculeatus]]'') and its subspecies populate Australia, [[Tasmania]], [[New Guinea]], and [[Kangaroo Island]] while the long-beaked echidna (''[[Zaglossus bruijni]]'') lives only in New Guinea. The platypus lives in the waters of eastern Australia. They have been introduced to Tasmania, [[King Island (Tasmania)|King Island]], and Kangaroo Island. These Monotremes are totally absent in the rest of the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Echidna: Extraordinary egg-laying mammal| first1= Michael | last1=Augee | first2=Brett | last2=Gooden | first3=Anne | last3=Musser| year=2006| publisher=CSIRO Publishing|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2UQH-YrWwCYC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false| isbn= 9780643092044 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Australia is missing many groups of [[placental]] mammals that are common on other continents ([[carnivora]]ns, [[artiodactyl]]s, [[shrew]]s, [[squirrel]]s, [[lagomorph]]s), although it does have indigenous [[bat]]s and [[Murinae|murine]] rodents; many other placentals, such as [[rabbit]]s and [[fox]]es, have been introduced there by humans.

Other animal distribution examples include [[bear]]s, located on all continents excluding Africa, Australia and Antarctica, and the polar bear solely in the Arctic Circle and adjacent land masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.seaworld.org/animal-info/info-books/polar-bear/habitat-&amp;-distribution.htm |title=Polar Bears/Habitat &amp; Distribution |accessdate=2011-02-21 |publisher=SeaWorld Parks &amp; Entertainment }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Penguins]] are found only around the South Pole despite similar weather conditions at the North Pole. Families of [[sirenians]] are distributed around the earth's waters, where [[manatees]] are located in western Africa waters, northern South American waters, and West Indian waters only while the related family, the [[dugong]]s, are located only in [[Oceania|Oceanic]] waters north of Australia, and the coasts surrounding the [[Indian Ocean]]. The now extinct [[Steller's sea cow]] resided in the [[Bering Sea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.savethemanatee.org/sirenian.htm |title= Sirenians of the World |accessdate=2011-02-21 |publisher=Save the Manatee Club}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The same kinds of fossils are found from areas known to be adjacent to one another in the past but that, through the process of [[continental drift]], are now in widely divergent geographic locations. For example, fossils of the same types of ancient amphibians, arthropods and ferns are found in South America, Africa, India, Australia and Antarctica, which can be dated to the [[Paleozoic]] Era, when these regions were united as a single landmass called [[Gondwana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://biology.clc.uc.edu/courses/bio303/contdrift.htm Continental Drift and Evolution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060211134652/http://biology.clc.uc.edu/courses/bio303/contdrift.htm |date=2006-02-11 }}. Biology.clc.uc.edu (2001-03-25). Retrieved on 2011-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes the descendants of these organisms can be identified and show unmistakable similarity to each other, even though they now inhabit very different regions and climates.

===Island biogeography===
[[File:Darwin's finches.jpeg|thumb|'''Figure 4a:''' Four of the [[Darwin's finches|13 finch species]] found on the [[Galápagos Islands|Galápagos Archipelago]], have evolved by an adaptive radiation that diversified their [[beak]] shapes to adapt them to different food sources.]]

====Types of species found on islands====
Evidence from [[island biogeography]] has played an important and historic role in the development of [[evolutionary biology]]. For purposes of [[biogeography]], islands are divided into two classes. Continental islands are islands like [[Great Britain]], and [[Japan]] that have at one time or another been part of a continent. Oceanic islands, like the [[Hawaiian islands]], the [[Galápagos Islands]] and [[St. Helena]], on the other hand are islands that have formed in the ocean and never been part of any continent. Oceanic islands have distributions of native plants and animals that are unbalanced in ways that make them distinct from the [[biota (ecology)|biota]]s found on continents or continental islands. Oceanic islands do not have native terrestrial mammals (they do sometimes have bats and seals), amphibians, or fresh water fish. In some cases they have terrestrial reptiles (such as the iguanas and giant tortoises of the Galápagos Islands) but often (such as in Hawaii) they do not. This is despite the fact that when species such as rats, goats, pigs, cats, mice, and [[cane toad]]s, are introduced to such islands by humans they often thrive. Starting with [[Charles Darwin]], many scientists have conducted experiments and made observations that have shown that the types of animals and plants found, and not found, on such islands are consistent with the theory that these islands were colonized accidentally by plants and animals that were able to reach them. Such accidental colonization could occur by air, such as plant seeds carried by migratory birds, or bats and insects being blown out over the sea by the wind, or by floating from a continent or other island by sea (for example, by some kinds of plant seeds like coconuts that can survive immersion in salt water), and reptiles that can survive for extended periods on rafts of vegetation carried to sea by storms.&lt;ref name=Coyne99-110/&gt;

====Endemism====
Many of the species found on remote islands are [[endemic]] to a particular island or group of islands, meaning they are found nowhere else on earth. Examples of species endemic to islands include many flightless birds of [[New Zealand]], [[lemurs]] of [[Madagascar]], the [[Komodo dragon]] of [[Komodo (island)|Komodo]],&lt;ref name="komo"&gt;{{cite book | editor1-last=Murphy | editor1-first=James B. | editor2-first=Claudio | editor2-last=Ciofi | editor3-first=Colomba | editor3-last=de la Panouse | editor4-first=Trooper | editor4-last=Walsh | title=Komodo Dragons: Biology and Conservation (Zoo and Aquarium Biology and Conservation Series) |publisher=Smithsonian Books|location=[[Washington, D.C.]]|year=2002|isbn=978-1-58834-073-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; the dragon's blood tree of [[Socotra]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/03/25/travel/tmagazine/03well.socotra.t.html |title= The Wonder Land of Socotra, Yemen |accessdate=2010-07-08 |publisher= ALAN BURDICK | first=Alan | last=Burdick | date=2007-03-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tuatara]] of New Zealand,&lt;ref name="TerraNature"&gt;{{cite web| publisher =TerraNature Trust| title=Tuatara| website =New Zealand Ecology: Living Fossils| year=2004| url=http://www.terranature.org/tuatara.htm | accessdate=2006-11-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="DoC"&gt;{{cite web | title=Facts about tuatara | website=Conservation: Native Species | publisher=Threatened Species Unit, Department of Conservation, Government of New Zealand | url=http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=33163 | accessdate=2007-02-10 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930182910/http://www.doc.govt.nz/templates/page.aspx?id=33163 | archive-date=30 September 2007 | dead-url=yes | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and others. However, many such endemic species are related to species found on other nearby islands or continents; the relationship of the animals found on the Galápagos Islands to those found in South America is a well-known example.&lt;ref name=Coyne99-110/&gt; All of these facts, the types of plants and animals found on oceanic islands, the large number of endemic species found on oceanic islands, and the relationship of such species to those living on the nearest continents, are most easily explained if the islands were colonized by species from nearby continents that evolved into the endemic species now found there.&lt;ref name="Coyne99-110"&gt;{{cite book| last=Coyne | first=Jerry A. |authorlink=Jerry A. Coyne |title=Why Evolution is True|publisher=Viking|year=2009 |pages=99–110|isbn=978-0-670-02053-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other types of endemism do not have to include, in the strict sense, islands. Islands can mean isolated lakes or remote and isolated areas. Examples of these would include the highlands of [[Ethiopia]], [[Lake Baikal]], [[fynbos]] of [[South Africa]], forests of [[New Caledonia]], and others. Examples of endemic organisms living in isolated areas include the [[kagu]] of New Caledonia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.birdlife.org/news/features/2006/05/new_caledonia.html|title=New Caledonia's most wanted |accessdate=2010-07-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[cloud rat]]s of the [[Luzon tropical pine forests]] of the [[Philippines]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.arkive.org/giant-bushy-tailed-cloud-rat/crateromys-schadenbergi/info.html |title=Giant bushy-tailed cloud rat (Crateromys schadenbergi) |accessdate= 2010-07-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Guide to Philippine Flora and Fauna | last=Rabor | first=D.S. | year=1986| publisher= Natural Resources Management Centre, Ministry of Natural Resources and University of the Philippines}}&lt;/ref&gt; the boojum tree (''[[Fouquieria columnaris]]'') of the [[Baja California peninsula]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Humphrey, Robert R. |title=The Boojum and its Home |year=1974 |publisher=University of Arizona Press |isbn=978-0816504367}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Baikal seal]]&lt;ref name=Schofield2001&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.themoscowtimes.com/stories/2001/07/27/106.html| title=Lake Baikal's Vanishing Nerpa Seal| last=Schofield| first=James| publisher=''[[The Moscow Times]]''| date=27 July 2001| accessdate=2007-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[omul]] of Lake Baikal.

====Adaptive radiations====
Oceanic islands are frequently inhabited by clusters of closely related species that fill a variety of [[ecological niches]], often niches that are filled by very different species on continents. Such clusters, like the finches of the Galápagos, [[Hawaiian honeycreeper]]s, members of the sunflower family on the [[Juan Fernandez Archipelago]] and wood weevils on St. Helena are called [[adaptive radiations]] because they are best explained by a single species colonizing an island (or group of islands) and then diversifying to fill available ecological niches. Such radiations can be spectacular; 800 species of the fruit fly family ''[[Drosophila]]'', nearly half the world's total, are endemic to the Hawaiian islands. Another illustrative example from Hawaii is the [[silversword alliance]], which is a group of thirty species found only on those islands. Members range from the [[Argyroxiphium|silversword]]s that flower spectacularly on high volcanic slopes to trees, shrubs, vines and mats that occur at various elevations from mountain top to sea level, and in Hawaiian habitats that vary from deserts to rainforests. Their closest relatives outside Hawaii, based on molecular studies, are [[tarweed]]s found on the west coast of North America. These tarweeds have sticky seeds that facilitate distribution by migrant birds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1=Baldwin | first1=B. G. | first2=R.

===Ring species===
{{main|Ring species}}
[[File:Ring Species (gene flow around a barrier).png|thumb|300px|In a [[ring species]], gene flow occurs between neighboring populations, but at the ends of the "ring", the populations cannot interbreed.]]
A ring species is a connected series of populations, each of which can interbreed with its neighbors, with at least two "end" populations which are too distantly related to interbreed, though with the potential for [[gene flow]] between all the populations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1023/A:1013319217703 |author=Irwin, D.E.; Irwin, J.H.; Price, T.D. |title=Ring species as bridges between microevolution and speciation |journal=Genetica |volume=112-113 |pages=223–43 |year=2001 |pmid=11838767 |url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0016-6707&amp;volume=112-113&amp;page=223}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ring species represent [[speciation]] and have been cited as evidence of evolution. They illustrate what happens over time as populations genetically diverge, specifically because they represent, in living populations, what normally happens over time between long deceased ancestor populations and living populations, in which the intermediates have become [[extinct]]. [[Richard Dawkins]] says that ring species "are only showing us in the spatial dimension something that must always happen in the time dimension".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Dawkins, Richard |authorlink=Richard Dawkins | title=The Ancestor's Tale| year=2004 | publisher=Houghton Mifflin | isbn=978-0-618-00583-3 |page=303|title-link=The Ancestor's Tale }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Distribution of ''Glossopteris''====
The combination of continental drift and evolution can sometimes be used to predict what will be found in the fossil record. ''[[Glossopteris]]'' is an extinct species of [[seed fern]] plants from the [[Permian]]. ''Glossopteris'' appears in the fossil record around the beginning of the Permian on the ancient continent of [[Gondwana]].&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Paul and Kenrick, Paul. 2004. Fossil Plants. Smithsonian Books (in association with the Natural History Museum of London), Washington, D.C. {{ISBN|1-58834-156-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Continental drift explains the current biogeography of the tree. Present day ''Glossopteris'' fossils are found in Permian strata in southeast South America, southeast Africa, all of Madagascar, northern India, all of Australia, all of New Zealand, and scattered on the southern and northern edges of Antarctica. During the Permian, these continents were connected as Gondwana (see figure 4c) in agreement with magnetic striping, other fossil distributions, and glacial scratches pointing away from the temperate climate of the South Pole during the Permian.&lt;ref name="Coyne103"&gt;{{cite book|last=Coyne | first=Jerry A. |authorlink=Jerry A.

====Metatherian distribution====
The history of [[metatheria]]ns (the clade containing [[marsupials]] and their extinct, primitive ancestors) provides an example of how evolutionary theory and the movement of continents can be combined to make predictions concerning fossil stratigraphy and distribution. The [[Sinodelphys|oldest metatherian fossils]] are found in present-day [[China]].&lt;ref name="Luoetal2003"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Luo|first=Zhe-Xi| last2=Ji | first2=Qiang | last3=Wible | first3=John R. | last4=Yuan | first4=Chong-Xi | title=An early Cretaceous tribosphenic mammal and metatherian evolution|journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]]|volume=302|issue=5652|pages=1934–1940|date=2003-12-12|url= http://www.sciencemag.org/content/302/5652/1934.abstract|doi=10.1126/science.1090718|pmid=14671295|accessdate=2010-12-27|ref=harv|bibcode=2003Sci...302.1934L }}&lt;/ref&gt; Metatherians spread westward into modern North America (still attached to Eurasia) and then to South America, which was connected to North America until around 65 mya. Marsupials reached Australia via Antarctica about 50 mya, shortly after Australia had split off suggesting a single dispersion event of just one species.&lt;ref name="Nilsson"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nilsson|first=M.

Geologic evidence suggests that between 30 and 40 million years ago South America and Australia were still part of the Southern Hemisphere super continent of [[Gondwana]] and that they were connected by land that is now part of Antarctica. Therefore, when combining the models, scientists could predict that marsupials migrated from what is now South America, through Antarctica, and then to present-day Australia between 40 and 30 million years ago. A first [[marsupial]] fossil of the extinct family [[Polydolopidae]] was found on [[Seymour Island]] on the [[Antarctic Peninsula]] in 1982.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Woodburne |first=Michael O. | last2=Zinsmeister | first2=William J. |date=Oct 1982 |title=Fossil Land Mammal from Antarctica |journal=Science |volume=218 |issue=4569 |pages=284–286 |id= |url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/218/4569/284 |accessdate=2009-01-17 |doi=10.1126/science.218.4569.284 |pmid=17838631 |ref=harv |bibcode=1982Sci...218..284W }}&lt;/ref&gt; Further fossils have subsequently been found, including members of the marsupial orders [[Didelphimorphia]] (opossum) and [[Microbiotheria]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Goin |first=Francisco J. |date=Dec 1999 |title=New Discoveries of "Opposum-Like" Marsupials from Antarctica (Seymour Island, Medial Eocene) |journal=Journal of Mammalian Evolution |volume=6 |issue=4 |pages=335–365 |id= |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/h5r16469kqr06560/ |accessdate=2009-01-17 |doi=10.1023/A:1027357927460 |ref=harv |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as [[ungulate]]s and a member of the enigmatic extinct order [[Gondwanatheria]], possibly ''[[Sudamerica ameghinoi]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reguero |first=Marcelo A. | first2=Sergio A. | last2=Marenssi | first3=Sergio N. | last3=Santillana |date=May 2002 |title=Antarctic Peninsula and South America (Patagonia) Paleogene terrestrial faunas and environments: biogeographic relationships |journal=Palaeogeography, Palaeoclimatology, Palaeoecology |volume=179 |issue=3–4 |pages=189–210 |id= |url= |doi=10.1016/S0031-0182(01)00417-5 |ref=harv |bibcode=2002PPP...179..189R }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Polar"&gt;Mills, William James.

====Migration, isolation, and distribution of the camel====
The history of the [[camel]] provides an example of how fossil evidence can be used to reconstruct migration and subsequent evolution. The fossil record indicates that the evolution of [[camelid]]s started in North America (see figure 4e), from which, six million years ago, they migrated across the Bering Strait into Asia and then to Africa, and 3.5 million years ago through the Isthmus of Panama into South America. Once isolated, they evolved along their own lines, giving rise to the [[Bactrian camel]] and [[dromedary]] in Asia and Africa and the [[Lama (genus)|llama and its relatives]] in South America. Camelids then became extinct in North America at the end of the last [[ice age]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last1=Prothero | first1=Donald R. | last2=Schoch | first2=Robert M. | title=Horns, tusks, and flippers: the evolution of hoofed mammals|publisher=JHU press|year=2002|page=45|isbn=978-0-8018-7135-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Evidence from selection==
Examples for the evidence for evolution often stem from direct observation of [[natural selection]] in the field and the laboratory. This section is unique in that it provides a narrower context concerning the process of selection. All of the examples provided prior to this have described the evidence that evolution has occurred, but has not provided the major underlying mechanism: natural selection. This section explicitly provides evidence that natural selection occurs, has been replicated artificially, and can be replicated in laboratory experiments.

Scientists have observed and documented a multitude of events where natural selection is in action. The most well known examples are antibiotic resistance in the medical field along with better-known laboratory experiments documenting evolution's occurrence. Natural selection is tantamount to common descent in that long-term occurrence and selection pressures can lead to the diversity of life on earth as found today. All adaptations—documented and undocumented changes concerned—are caused by natural selection (and a few other minor processes). It is well established that, "...natural selection is a ubiquitous part of speciation...",&lt;ref name=JMSobel2009&gt;{{Citation | title=The Biology of Speciation|author1=James M. Sobel | journal=Evolution| year=2009| volume=64| issue=2| pages=295–315| doi=10.1111/j.1558-5646.2009.00877.x|pmid=19891628 |display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is the primary driver of speciation;&lt;ref name="Speciation"&gt;{{Citation | title=Speciation| edition=|author1=Jerry A. Coyne |author2=H. Allen Orr | date=2004| pages=5| publisher=Sinauer Associates| isbn=978-0-87893-089-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; therefore, the following examples of natural selection ''and'' speciation will often interdepend or correspond with one another. The examples below are only a small fraction of the actual experiments and observations.

===Artificial selection and experimental evolution===
[[File:Big and little dog 1.jpg|thumb|right|225px|'''Figure 5a:''' The [[Chihuahua (dog)|Chihuahua]] [[mixed-breed dog|mix]] and [[Great Dane]] illustrate the range of sizes among dog breeds.]]
[[Artificial selection]] demonstrates the diversity that can exist among organisms that share a relatively recent common ancestor. In artificial selection, one species is bred selectively at each generation, allowing only those organisms that exhibit desired characteristics to reproduce. These characteristics become increasingly well developed in successive generations. Artificial selection was successful long before science discovered the genetic basis. Examples of artificial selection include [[dog breeding]], [[genetically modified food]], flower breeding, and the cultivation of foods such as [[Brassica oleracea|wild cabbage]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Raven|first=Peter H.|authorlink=Peter H. Raven|title=Biology of Plants|edition=7th rev.|year=2005|publisher=W.H. Freeman|location=New York|isbn=978-0-7167-6284-3|oclc=183148564}}&lt;/ref&gt; and others.

[[Experimental evolution]] uses controlled experiments to test hypotheses and theories of evolution. In one early example, [[William Dallinger]] set up an experiment shortly before 1880, subjecting microbes to heat with the aim of forcing adaptive changes. His experiment ran for around seven years, and his published results were acclaimed, but he did not resume the experiment after the apparatus failed.&lt;ref name="urlThe Rev"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.asa3.org/ASA/PSCF/2000/PSCF6-00Haas.html |title=The Rev.

A large-scale example of experimental evolution is [[Richard Lenski]]'s [[E. coli long-term evolution experiment|multi-generation experiment with ''Escherichia coli'']]. Lenski observed that some strains of ''[[E. coli]]'' evolved a complex new ability, the ability to metabolize [[citrate]], after tens of thousands of generations.&lt;ref name="newscientist"&gt;{{cite web|last=Le Page|first=Michael|title=NS:bacteria make major evolutionary shift in the lab|url=https://www.newscientist.com/channel/life/dn14094-bacteria-make-major-evolutionary-shift-in-the-lab.htm |date=16 April 2008 |publisher=New Scientist |accessdate=9 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lenski&gt;{{cite journal |author=Blount Z.D.; Borland C.Z.; Lenski, R.E. |title=Historical contingency and the evolution of a key innovation in an experimental population of Escherichia coli |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |volume=105 |issue=23 |pages=7899–906 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18524956 |pmc=2430337 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0803151105 |bibcode=2008PNAS..105.7899B |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The evolutionary biologist Jerry Coyne commented as a critique of creationism, saying, "the thing I like most is it says you can get these [[complex traits]] evolving by a combination of unlikely events. That's just what creationists say can't happen."&lt;ref name="newscientist" /&gt; In addition to the metabolic changes, the different bacterial populations were found to have diverged in respect to both morphology (the overall size of the cell) and fitness (of which was measured in competition with the ancestors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Dynamics of adaptation and diversification: A 10,000-generation experiment with bacterial populations |author1=Lenski, Richard E. |author2=Travisano, Michael | journal=PNAS | year=1994| volume=91|issue=15 | pages=6808–6814| doi=10.1073/pnas.91.15.6808| pmid=8041701| pmc=44287|bibcode=1994PNAS...91.6808L }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''E. coli'' long-term evolution experiment that began in 1988 is still in progress, and has shown adaptations including the evolution of a strain of ''E. coli'' that was able to grow on citric acid in the growth media—a trait absent in all other known forms of ''E. coli'', including the initial strain.

===Invertebrates===

====Historical lead tolerance in ''Daphnia''====

A study of species of ''[[Daphnia]]'' and lead pollution in the 20th century predicted that an increase in lead pollution would lead to strong selection of lead tolerance. Researchers were able to use "resurrection ecology", hatching decades-old ''Daphnia'' eggs from the time when lakes were heavily polluted with lead. The hatchlings in the study were compared to current-day ''Daphnia'', and demonstrated "dramatic fitness differences between old and modern phenotypes when confronted with a widespread historical environmental stressor". Essentially, the modern-day ''Daphnia'' were unable to resist or tolerate high levels of lead (this is due to the huge reduction of lead pollution in 21st century lakes). The old hatchlings, however, were able to tolerate high lead pollution. The authors concluded that "by employing the techniques of resurrection ecology, we were able to show clear phenotypic change over decades...".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Rapid Evolutionary Loss of Metal Resistance Revealed by Hatching Decades-Old Eggs|author1=Turko, Patrick | journal=Evolution| year=2016| volume=70| issue=2| pages=398–407| doi=10.1111/evo.12859 |display-authors=etal| pmid=26768308}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Peppered moths====
{{main|Peppered moth evolution}}

A classic example was the phenotypic change, light-to-dark color adaptation, in the [[Peppered moth evolution|peppered moth]], due to pollution from the [[Industrial Revolution]] in England.

===Microbes===

====Antimicrobial resistance====
{{Main|Antimicrobial resistance}}

The development and spread of [[antibiotic]]-resistant [[bacteria]] is evidence for the process of evolution of species. Thus the appearance of [[vancomycin]]-resistant ''[[Golden staph|Staphylococcus aureus]]'', and the danger it poses to hospital patients, is a direct result of evolution through natural selection. The rise of ''[[Shigella]]'' strains resistant to the synthetic antibiotic class of [[Sulfonamide (medicine)|sulfonamides]] also demonstrates the generation of new information as an evolutionary process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last1=Tanaka | first1=T. | last2=Hashimoto | first2=H. | year =1989| title=Drug-resistance and its transferability of Shigella strains isolated in 1986 in Japan| journal =Kansenshogaku Zasshi | volume =63 | issue =1 | pages =15–26| pmid=2501419| ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, the appearance of [[DDT]] resistance in various forms of ''[[Anopheles]]'' mosquitoes, and the appearance of [[myxomatosis]] resistance in breeding rabbit populations in Australia, are both evidence of the existence of evolution in situations of evolutionary [[selection pressure]] in species in which generations occur rapidly.

All classes of microbes develop resistance: including fungi ([[antifungal]] resistance), [[virus]]es ([[antiviral]] resistance), [[protozoa]] ([[antiprotozoal]] resistance), and [[bacteria]] ([[antibiotic]] resistance). This is to be expected when considering that all life exhibits universal genetic code and is therefore subject to the process of evolution through its various mechanisms.

====Nylon-eating bacteria====
Another example of organisms adapting to human-caused conditions are [[Nylon-eating bacteria]]: a strain of ''[[Flavobacterium]]'' that are capable of digesting certain byproducts of [[nylon 6]] manufacturing. There is scientific consensus that the capacity to synthesize nylonase most probably developed as a single-step mutation that survived because it improved the fitness of the bacteria possessing the mutation. This is seen as a good example of evolution through mutation and natural selection that has been observed as it occurs and could not have come about until the production of nylon by humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Thwaites | first=W.M. |title=New Proteins Without God's Help |journal=Creation Evolution Journal |volume=5 |issue=2 |pages=1–3 |date=Summer 1985 |url=http://ncse.com/cej/5/2/new-proteins-without-gods-help |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nmsr.org/nylon.htm Evolution and Information: The Nylon Bug].

===Plants and fungi===

====Monkeyflower radiation====
Both subspecies ''Mimulus aurantiacus puniceus'' (red-flowered) and ''Mimulus aurantiacus australis'' (yellow-flowered) of monkeyflowers are isolated due to the preferences of their hummingbird and hawkmoth pollinators. The radiation of ''M. aurantiacus'' subspecies are mostly yellow colored; however, both ''M. a.'' ssp. ''puniceus'' and ''M. a.'' ssp. ''flemingii'' are red. Phylogenetic analysis suggests two independent origins of red-colored flowers that arose due to ''cis''-regulatory mutations in the gene ''MaMyb2'' that is present in all ''M. aurantiacus'' subspecies. Further research suggested that two independent mutations did not take place, but one ''MaMyb2'' allele was transferred via introgressive hybridization.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title= Introgressive hybridization facilitates adaptive divergence in a recent radiation of monkeyflowers |author1=Sean Stankowski |author2=Matthew A.

Gene isolation and ''cis''-regulatory functions; phylogenetic analysis; geographic location and pollinator preference; and species hybridization and speciation are just some of the areas in which data can be obtained to document the occurrence of evolution.

====Radiotrophic fungi====
Like the codfish, human-caused pollution can come in different forms. [[Radiotrophic fungi]] is a perfect example of natural selection taking place after a chemical accident. Radiotrophic fungi appears to use the pigment [[melanin]] to convert [[Gamma rays|gamma radiation]] into chemical energy for growth&lt;ref name="sciencenews.org"&gt;[http://www.sciencenews.org/articles/20070526/fob5.asp Science News, Dark Power: Pigment seems to put radiation to good use], Week of 26 May 2007; Vol. 171, No. 21, p. 325 by Davide Castelvecchi&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Ionizing Radiation Changes the Electronic Properties of Melanin and Enhances the Growth of Melanized Fungi | last1=Dadachova | first1=E. | last2=Bryan | first2=R.A. | last3=Huang | first3=X. | last4=Moadel | first4=T. | last5=Schweitzer | first5=A.D. | last6=Aisen | first6=P. | last7=Nosanchuk | first7=J.D. | last8=Casadevall | first8=A. |year=2007 |journal=PLOS ONE |volume=2 |pages=e457 |pmid=17520016 |doi =10.1371/journal.pone.0000457 |issue=5 |pmc=1866175 |editor1-last=Rutherford |editor1-first=Julian|bibcode=2007PLoSO...2..457D |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; and were first discovered in 2007 as black [[molds]] growing inside and around the [[Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant]].&lt;ref name="sciencenews.org"/&gt; Research at the [[Albert Einstein College of Medicine]] showed that three melanin-containing fungi, ''[[Cladosporium sphaerospermum]]'', ''[[Wangiella dermatitidis]]'', and ''[[Cryptococcus neoformans]]'', increased in [[biomass]] and accumulated [[acetate]] faster in an environment in which the [[radiation]] level was 500 times higher than in the normal environment.

====Guppies====
While studying [[Guppy|guppies]] (''Poecilia reticulata'') in [[Trinidad]], biologist John Endler detected selection at work on the fish populations. To rule out alternative possibilities, Endler set up a highly controlled experiment to mimic the natural habitat by constructing ten ponds within a laboratory greenhouse at [[Princeton University]]. Each pond contained gravel to exactly match that of the natural ponds. After capturing a random sample of guppies from ponds in [[Trinidad]], he raised and mixed them to create similar genetically diverse populations and measured each fish (spot length, spot height, spot area, relative spot length, relative spot height, total patch area, and standard body lengths). For the experiment he added ''[[Crenicichla]] alta'' (''P. reticulata'''s main predator) in four of the ponds, ''[[Rivulus]] hartii'' (a non-predator fish) in four of the ponds, and left the remaining two ponds empty with only the guppies. After 10 generations, comparisons were made between each pond's guppy populations and measurements were taken again. Endler found that the populations had evolved dramatically different color patterns in the control and non-predator pools and drab color patterns in the predator pool. Predation pressure had caused a selection against standing out from background gravel.&lt;ref name="Endler - P. reticulata"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Natural Selection on Color Patterns in Poecilia reticulata| author=John A. Endler| journal=Evolution| year=1980| volume=34| issue=1| pages=76–91| doi=10.2307/2408316| pmid=28563214| jstor=2408316}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Guppy CS pair 4 20130113.jpg|thumb|left|225px|'''Figure 5b''': Endler's Trinadadian guppies (''[[Poecilia reticulata]]'')]]
In parallel, during this experiment, Endler conducted a field experiment in Trinidad where he caught guppies from ponds where they had predators and relocated them to ponds upstream where the predators did not live. After 15 generations, Endler found that the relocated guppies had evolved dramatic and colorful patterns. Essentially, both experiments showed convergence due to similar selection pressures (i.e. predator selection against contrasting color patterns and sexual selection for contrasting color patterns).&lt;ref name="Endler - P. reticulata"/&gt;

In a later study by David Reznick, the field population was examined 11 years later after Endler relocated the guppies to high streams. The study found that the populations has evolved in a number of different ways: bright color patterns, late maturation, larger sizes, smaller litter sizes, and larger offspring within litters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title= Evaluation of the Rate of Evolution in Natural Populations of Guppies (''Poecilia reticulata'')|author1=David N.

====Humans====
Natural selection is observed in contemporary human populations, with recent findings demonstrating that the population at risk of the severe debilitating disease [[kuru (disease)|kuru]] has significant over-representation of an immune variant of the [[prion protein]] gene G127V versus non-immune alleles. Scientists postulate one of the reasons for the rapid selection of this [[Mutation|genetic variant]] is the lethality of the disease in non-immune persons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last=Medical Research Council (UK)| title=Brain Disease 'Resistance Gene' Evolves in Papua New Guinea Community; Could Offer Insights Into CJD| newspaper=Science Daily (online)| location=Science News| date=21 November 2009| url=https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2009/11/091120091959.htm| accessdate=2009-11-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| doi=10.1056/NEJMoa0809716| pmid=19923577| year=2009| last1=Mead | first1=S.| last2=Whitfield | first2=J.| last3=Poulter | first3=M.| last4=Shah | first4=P.| last5=Uphill | first5=J.| last6=Campbell | first6=T.| last7=Al-Dujaily | first7=H.| last8=Hummerich | first8=H.| last9=Beck | first9=J.| last10=Mein | first10=C.

A well known example of selection occurring in human populations is lactose tolerance. [[Lactose intolerance]] is the inability to [[Metabolism|metabolize]] [[lactose]], because of a lack of the required enzyme [[lactase]] in the digestive system. The normal mammalian condition is for the young of a species to experience reduced lactase production at the end of the [[weaning]] period (a species-specific length of time). In humans, in non-dairy consuming societies, lactase production usually drops about 90% during the first four years of life, although the exact drop over time varies widely.&lt;ref name=soy&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071215230655/http://www.soynutrition.com/SoyHealth/SoyLactoseIntolerance.aspx Soy and Lactose Intolerance] Wayback: Soy Nutrition&lt;/ref&gt; Lactase activity persistence in adults is associated with two [[polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]]s: C/T 13910 and G/A 22018 located in the ''MCM6'' gene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Enattah, N.S.; Sahi, T.; Savilahti, E.; Terwilliger, J.D.; Peltonen, L.; Järvelä, I. | title=Identification of a variant associated with adult-type hypolactasia | journal=Nature Genetics | volume=30 | issue=2 | pages=233–7 | year=2002 | pmid=11788828 | doi=10.1038/ng826 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This gene difference eliminates the shutdown in lactase production, making it possible for members of these populations to continue consumption of raw milk and other fresh and fermented dairy products throughout their lives without difficulty.

====Italian wall lizards====
In 1971, ten adult specimens of ''[[Podarcis sicula]]'' (the Italian wall lizard) were transported from the [[Croatia]]n island of Pod Kopište to the island Pod Mrčaru (about 3.5&amp;nbsp;km to the east). Both islands lie in the [[Adriatic Sea]] near [[Lastovo]], where the lizards founded a new [[Population bottleneck|bottlenecked]] population.&lt;ref name="Herrel et al."&gt;{{cite journal |author=Herrel, A.; Huyghe, K.; Vanhooydonck, B. |title=Rapid large-scale evolutionary divergence in morphology and performance associated with exploitation of a different dietary resource |journal=Proc.

In the 1990s, scientists returned to Pod Mrčaru and found that the lizards there differed greatly from those on Kopište. While [[mitochondrial DNA]] analyses have verified that ''P. sicula'' currently on Mrčaru are genetically very similar to the Kopište source population,&lt;ref name="Herrel et al."/&gt; the new Mrčaru population of ''P. sicula'' had a larger average size, shorter hind limbs, lower maximal sprint speed and altered response to simulated predatory attacks compared to the original Kopište population.&lt;ref name="Vervust et al."/&gt; These changes were attributed to "relaxed predation intensity" and greater protection from vegetation on Mrčaru.&lt;ref name="Vervust et al."/&gt;

In 2008, further analysis revealed that the Mrčaru population of ''P. sicula'' have significantly different head morphology (longer, wider, and taller heads) and increased bite force compared to the original Kopište population.&lt;ref name="Herrel et al."/&gt; This change in head shape corresponded with a shift in diet: Kopište ''P. sicula'' are primarily [[insectivorous]], but those on Mrčaru eat substantially more plant matter.&lt;ref name="Herrel et al."/&gt; The changes in foraging style may have contributed to a greater population density and decreased territorial behavior of the Mrčaru population.&lt;ref name="Herrel et al."/&gt;

Another difference found between the two populations was the discovery, in the Mrčaru lizards, of [[Ileocecal valve|cecal valve]]s, which slow down food passage and provide fermenting chambers, allowing [[commensal]] microorganisms to convert [[cellulose]] to nutrients digestible by the lizards.&lt;ref name="Herrel et al."/&gt; Additionally, the researchers discovered that [[nematode]]s were common in the guts of Mrčaru lizards, but absent from Kopište ''P. sicula'', which do not have cecal valves.&lt;ref name="Herrel et al."/&gt; The cecal valves, which occur in less than 1 percent of all known species of scaled reptiles,&lt;ref name="Herrel et al."/&gt; have been described as an "adaptive novelty, a brand new feature not present in the ancestral population and newly evolved in these lizards".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Myers |first=PZ |title=Still just a lizard |publisher=ScienceBlogs |date=23 April 2008 |url=http://scienceblogs.com/pharyngula/2008/04/23/still-just-a-lizard/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====PAH resistance in killifish====
A similar study was also done regarding the polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) that pollute the waters of the Elizabeth River in Portsmouth, Virginia. This chemical is a product of [[creosote]], a type of tar. The Atlantic killifish (''[[Fundulus]] heteroclitus'') has evolved a resistance to PAHs involving the AHR gene (the same gene involved in the tomcods). This particular study focused on the resistance to "acute toxicity and cardiac teratogenesis" caused by PAHs.

====PCB resistance in codfish====
An example involving the direct observation of gene modification due to selection pressures is the resistance to PCBs in codfish. After [[General Electric]] dumped [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs) in the [[Hudson River]] from 1947 through 1976, [[Microgadus tomcod|tomcods]] (''Microgadus tomcod'') living in the river were found to have evolved an increased resistance to the compound's toxic effects.&lt;ref name="Welsh"&gt;{{cite web| last=Welsh| first=Jennifer | title=Fish Evolved to Survive GE Toxins in Hudson River| publisher=[[LiveScience]]| date=17 February 2011 | url=http://www.livescience.com/12897-fish-evolved-survive-ge-toxins-hudson-110218.html | accessdate =2011-02-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The tolerance to the toxins is due to a change in the coding section of specific gene. Genetic samples were taken from the cods from 8 different rivers in the New England region: the St. Lawrence River, Miramichi River, Margaree River, Squamscott River, Niantic River, the Shinnecock Basic, the Hudson River, and the Hackensack River. Genetic analysis found that in the population of tomcods in the four southernmost rivers, the gene AHR2 ([[aryl hydrocarbon receptor]] 2) was present as an allele with a difference of two amino acid deletions.&lt;ref name="Isaac"&gt;{{cite journal | title=Mechanistic Basis of Resistance to PCBs in Atlantic Tomcod from the Hudson River| author=Isaac Wirgin| journal=Science| year=2011| volume=331| issue=6022| pages=1322–1325| doi=10.1126/science.1197296 |display-authors=etal |bibcode=2011Sci...331.1322W| pmid=21330491| pmc=3246799}}&lt;/ref&gt; This deletion conferred a resistance to PCB in the fish species and was found in 99% of Hudson River tomcods, 92% in the Hackensack River, 6% in the Niantic River, and 5% in Shinnecock Bay.&lt;ref name="Isaac"/&gt; This pattern along the sampled bodies of waters infers a direct correlation of selective pressures leading to the evolution of PCB resistance in Atlantic tomcod fish.&lt;ref name="Isaac"/&gt;

====Urban wildlife====
[[Urban wildlife]] is a broad and easily observable case of human-caused selection pressure on [[wildlife]]. With the growth in human habitats, different animals have adapted to survive within these urban environments. These types of environments can exert selection pressures on organisms, often leading to new adaptations. For example, the weed [[Crepis|''Crepis sancta'']], found in France, has two types of seed, heavy and fluffy. The heavy ones land nearby to the parent plant, whereas fluffy seeds float further away on the wind. In urban environments, seeds that float far often land on infertile concrete. Within about 5–12 generations, the weed evolves to produce significantly heavier seeds than its rural relatives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1073/pnas.0708446105 | title=Rapid evolution of seed dispersal in an urban environment in the weed Crepis sancta| last1=Cheptou | first1=P. | last2=Carrue | first2=O. | last3=Rouifed | first3=S. | last4=Cantarel | first4=A. | journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences| year=2008| volume=105 | issue=10| pages=3796–9| pmid=18316722 | pmc=2268839 |bibcode=2008PNAS..105.3796C | ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://theoystersgarter.com/2008/03/12/evolution-in-the-urban-jungle/ |title=Evolution in the urban jungle |accessdate=2010-07-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121108105314/http://theoystersgarter.com/2008/03/12/evolution-in-the-urban-jungle/ |archivedate=2012-11-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other examples of urban wildlife are [[rock pigeon]]s and species of crows adapting to city environments around the world; African penguins in [[Simon's Town]]; [[baboon]]s in [[South Africa]]; and a variety of insects living in human habitations.

''[[Holbrookia maculata]]'', ''[[Aspidoscelis inornatus]]'', and ''[[Sceloporus undulatus]]'' exhibit ecotonal populations that match both the dark soils and the white sands in the region. Research conducted on these species has found significant phenotypic and genotypic differences between the dark and light populations due to strong selection pressures. For example, ''H. maculata'' exhibits the strongest phenotypic difference (matches best with the substrate) of the light colored population coinciding with the least amount of gene flow between the populations and the highest genetic differences when compared to the other two lizard species.&lt;ref name=EBRosenblum /&gt;

[[White Sands National Monument|New Mexico's White Sands]] are a recent geologic formation (approximately 6000 years old&lt;ref name=JMRobertson /&gt; to possibly 2000 years old&lt;ref name=EBRosenblum /&gt;). This recent origin of these gypsum sand dunes suggests that species exhibiting lighter-colored variations have evolved in a relatively short time frame. The three lizard species previously mentioned have been found to display variable social signal coloration in coexistence with their ecotonal variants.&lt;ref name=JMRobertson /&gt; Not only have the three species convergently evolved their lighter variants due to the selection pressures from the environment, they've also evolved ecomorphological differences: morphology, behavior (in is case, escape behavior), and performance (in this case, sprint speed) collectively.&lt;ref name=SDRoches /&gt; Roches' work found surprising results in the escape behavior of ''H. maculata'' and ''S. undulatus''. When dark morphs were placed on white sands, their startle response was significantly diminished. This result could be due to varying factors relating to sand temperature or visual acuity; however, regardless of the cause, "…failure of mismatched lizards to sprint could be maladaptive when faced with a predator".&lt;ref name=SDRoches /&gt;

Instances of speciation have been observed in both nature and the laboratory. A.-B Florin and A. Ödeen note that, "strong laboratory evidence for allopatric speciation is lacking..."; however, contrary to laboratory studies (focused specifically on models of allopatric speciation), "speciation most definitely occurs; [and] the vast amount of evidence from nature makes it unreasonable to argue otherwise".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Laboratory environments are not conducive for allopatric speciation |author1=Florin, A.-B. |author2=A.

Research documenting speciation is abundant. Biologists have documented numerous examples of speciation in nature—with evolution having produced far more species than any observer would consider necessary. For example, there are well over 350,000 described species of beetles.&lt;ref&gt;Liebherr, James K.; McHugh, Joseph V. ''in'' Resh, V. H.; Cardé, R. T. (Editors) 2003. Encyclopedia of Insects. Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Examples of speciation come from the observations of island biogeography and the process of adaptive radiation, both explained previously. Evidence of common descent can also be found through paleontological studies of speciation within geologic strata. The examples described below represent different modes of speciation and provide strong evidence for common descent. It is important to acknowledge that not all speciation research directly observes divergence from "start-to-finish". This is by virtue of research delimitation and definition ambiguity, and occasionally leads research towards historical reconstructions. In light of this, examples abound, and the following are by no means exhaustive—comprising only a small fraction of the instances observed. Once again, take note of the established fact that, "...natural selection is a ubiquitous part of speciation...",&lt;ref name=JMSobel2009/&gt; and is the primary driver of speciation,&lt;ref name="Speciation"/&gt; so; hereinafter, examples of speciation will often interdepend and correspond with selection.

===Fossils===
Limitations exist within the fossil record when considering the concept of what constitutes a species. Paleontologists largely rely on a different framework: the morphological species concept.&lt;ref name=PNBenton /&gt; Due to the absence of information such as reproductive behavior or genetic material in fossils, paleontologists distinguish species by their phenotypic differences.&lt;ref name=PNBenton&gt;{{Citation | title=Speciation in the Fossil Record|author1=Benton, Michael J. |author2=Pearson, Paul N. | journal=Trends in Ecology and Evolution| year=2001| volume=16| issue=7| pages=405–411| doi=10.1016/S0169-5347(01)02149-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Extensive investigation of the fossil record has led to numerous theories concerning speciation (in the context of paleontology) with many of the studies suggesting that stasis, [[Punctuated equilibrium|punctuation]], and lineage branching are common. In 1995, D. H. Erwin, et al. published a major work—''New Approaches to Speciation in the Fossil Record''—which compiled 58 studies of fossil speciation (between 1972 and 1995) finding most of the examples suggesting stasis (involving [[anagenesis]] or punctuation) and 16 studies suggesting speciation.&lt;ref name=PNBenton /&gt; Despite stasis appearing to be the predominate conclusion at first glance, this particular meta-study investigated deeper, concluding that, "...no single pattern appears dominate..." with "...the preponderance of studies illustrating ''both'' stasis and gradualism in the history of a single lineage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=New Approaches to Speciation in the Fossil Record| edition=|author1=Erwin, D. H. |author2= Anstey, R. L. |last-author-amp=yes | date=1995| pages=22| publisher=Columbia University Press| isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the studies conducted utilize seafloor sediments that can provide a significant amount of data concerning [[plankton]]ic microfossils.&lt;ref name=PNBenton /&gt; The succession of fossils in stratigraphy can be used to determine evolutionary trends among fossil organisms. In addition, incidences of speciation can be interpreted from the data and numerous studies have been conducted documenting both morphological evolution and speciation.

====''Globorotalia''====
[[File:Globorotalia Speciation and Phylogeny.png|thumb|right|225px|'''Figure 6a''': Morphologic change of ''Globorotalia crassaformis, G. tosaensis, and G. truncatulinoides'' over 3.5 Ma. Superimposed is a phylogenetic tree of the group. Adapted from Lazarus ''et al.'' (1995).]]
Extensive research on the planktonic foraminifer ''[[Globorotalia]] truncatulinoides'' has provided insight into paleobiogeographical and paleoenvironmental studies alongside the relationship between the environment and evolution. In an extensive study of the paleobiogeography of ''G. truncatulinoides'', researchers found evidence that suggested the formation of a new species (via the sympatric speciation framework). Cores taken of the sediment containing the three species ''G. crassaformis'', ''G. tosaensis'', and ''G. truncatulinoides'' found that before 2.7 Ma, only ''G. crassaformis'' and ''G. tosaensis'' existed. A speciation event occurred at that time, whereby intermediate forms existed for quite some time. Eventually ''G. tosaensis'' disappears from the record (suggesting extinction) but exists as an intermediate between the extant ''G. crassaformis'' and ''G. truncatulinoides''. This record of the fossils also matched the already existing phylogeny constructed by morphological characters of the three species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Sympatric Speciation and Phyletic Change in ''Globorotalia truncatulinoides''|author1=Lazarus, David | journal=Paleobiology| year=1995| volume=21| issue=1| pages=28–51| doi=10.1017/s0094837300013063|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; See figure 6a.

====Radiolaria====
In a large study of five species of [[radiolarians]] (''[[Calocycletta caepa]]'', ''[[Pterocanium prismatium]]'', ''[[Pseudoculous vema]]'', ''[[Eucyrtidium calvertense]]'', and ''[[Eucyrtidium matuyamai]]''), the researchers documented considerable evolutionary change in each lineage. Alongside this, trends with the closely related species ''E. calvertense'' and ''E. matuyamai'' showed that about 1.9 Mya ''E. calvertense'' invaded a new region of the Pacific, becoming isolated from the main population. The stratigraphy of this species clearly shows that this isolated population evolved into ''E. Matuyamai''. It then reinvaded the region of the still-existing and static ''E. calvertense'' population whereby a sudden decrease in body size occurred. Eventually the invader ''E. matuyamai'' disappeared from the stratum (presumably due to extinction) coinciding with a desistance of size reduction of the ''E. calvertense'' population. From that point on, the change in size leveled to a constant. The authors suggest competition-induced [[character displacement]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Microevolutionary Patterns in Late Cenozoic Radiolaria |author1=Kellogg, Davida E. |author2=Hays, James D. | journal=Paleobiology | year=1975| volume=1| issue=2| pages=150–160| doi=10.1017/s0094837300002347}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Stratigraphy and Evolutionary Trends of Radiolaria in North Pacific Deep-Sea Sediments| author=Hays, James D. | journal=Geological Society of America Memoirs| year=1970| volume=126| issue=| pages=185–218| doi=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Rhizosolenia''====
Researchers conducted measurements on 5,000 ''[[Rhizosolenia]]'' (a planktonic [[diatom]]) specimens from eight sedimentary cores in the Pacific Ocean. The core samples spanned two million years and were chronologized using sedimentary magnetic field reversal measurements. All the core samples yielded a similar pattern of divergence: with a single lineage (''R. bergonii'') occurring before 3.1 Mya and two morphologically distinct lineages (daughter species: ''R. praebergonii'') appearing after. The parameters used to measure the samples were consistent throughout each core.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Cladogenetic and anagenetic changes in the morphology of ''Rhizosolenia praebergonii'' Mukhina|author1=Ulf Sörhannus | journal=Historical Biology| year=1998| volume=1| issue=3| pages=185–205| doi=10.1080/08912968809386474|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; An additional study of the daughter species ''R. praebergonii'' found that, after the divergence, it invaded the Indian Ocean.&lt;ref name=PNBenton /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Iterative evolution in the diatom genus ''Rhizosolenia'' Ehrenberg |author1=Sörhannus, Ulf | journal=Lethaia| year=1991| volume=24| issue=1| pages=39–44| doi=10.1111/j.1502-3931.1991.tb01178.x|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Turborotalia''====
A recent study was conducted involving the planktonic [[Foraminifera|foraminifer]] [[Turborotalia]]. The authors extracted "51 stratigraphically ordered samples from a site within the oceanographically stable tropical [[North Pacific gyre]]". Two hundred individual species were examined using ten specific morphological traits (size, compression index, chamber aspect ratio, chamber inflation, aperture aspect ratio, test height, test expansion, umbilical angle, coiling direction, and the number of chambers in the final whorl). Utilizing multivariate statistical [[Cluster analysis|clustering methods]], the study found that the species continued to evolve non-directionally within the [[Eocene]] from 45 Ma to about 36 Ma. However, from 36 Ma to approximately 34 Ma, the stratigraphic layers showed two distinct clusters with significantly defining characteristics distinguishing one another from a single species. The authors concluded that speciation must have occurred and that the two new species were ancestral to the prior species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Evolution and speciation in the Eocene planktonic foraminifer Turborotalia |author1=Pearson, Paul N. |author2=Ezard, Thomas H. G. | journal=Paleobiology | year=2014| volume=40| pages=130–143| doi= 10.1666/13004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Just as in most of evolutionary biology, this example represents the interdisciplinary nature of the field and the necessary collection of data from various fields (e.g. oceanography, paleontology) and the integration of mathematical analysis (e.g. biometry).

====Vertebrates====
There exists evidence for vertebrate speciation despite limitations imposed by the fossil record. Studies have been conducted documenting similar patterns seen in marine invertebrates.&lt;ref name=PNBenton /&gt; For example, extensive research documenting rates of morphological change, evolutionary trends, and speciation patterns in small mammals&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Species in the Fossil Record: Concepts, Trends, and Transitions| author=Gingerich, P.

A study of four mammalian genera: ''[[Hyopsodus]]'', ''[[Pelycodus]]'', ''[[Haplomylus]]'' (three from the Eocene), and ''[[Plesiadapis]]'' (from the Paleocene) found that—through a large number of stratigraphic layers and specimen sampling—each group exhibited, "gradual phyletic evolution, overall size increase, iterative evolution of small species, and character divergence following the origin of each new lineage".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Paleontology and Phylogeny: Patterns of Evolution at the Species Level in Early Tertiary Mammals| author=Gingerich, P.

In another study concerning morphological trends and rates of evolution found that the European [[Arvicolinae|arvicolid]] rodent radiated into 52 distinct lineages over a time frame of 5 million years while documenting examples of phyletic gradualism, punctuation, and stasis.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Morphological Trends and Rates of Evolution in Arvicolids (Arvicolidae, Rodentia): Towards a Punctuated Equilibria/Disequilibria Model|author1=Chaline, J. | journal=Quaternary International| year=1993| volume=19| issue=| pages=27–39| doi=10.1016/1040-6182(93)90019-c |display-authors=etal| bibcode=1993QuInt..19...27C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Invertebrates===

====''Drosophila melanogaster''====
[[File:Drosophila melanogaster - side (aka).jpg|thumb|right|225px|'''Figure 6b''': A common fruit fly (''[[Drosophila melanogaster]]'')]]
William R. Rice and George W. Salt found experimental evidence of [[sympatric speciation]] in the [[Drosophila melanogaster|common fruit fly]]. They collected a population of ''Drosophila melanogaster'' from [[Davis, California]] and placed the pupae into a habitat maze. Newborn flies had to investigate the maze to find food. The flies had three choices to take in finding food. Light and dark ([[phototaxis]]), up and down ([[geotaxis]]), and the scent of [[acetaldehyde]] and the scent of ethanol ([[chemotaxis]]) were the three options. This eventually divided the flies into 42 spatio-temporal habitats.

They then cultured two strains that chose opposite habitats. One of the strains emerged early, immediately flying upward in the dark attracted to the [[acetaldehyde]]. The other strain emerged late and immediately flew downward, attracted to light and ethanol. Pupae from the two strains were then placed together in the maze and allowed to mate at the food site. They then were collected. A selective penalty was imposed on the female flies that switched habitats. This entailed that none of their [[gametes]] would pass on to the next generation. After 25 generations of this mating test, it showed reproductive isolation between the two strains. They repeated the experiment again without creating the penalty against habitat switching and the result was the same; reproductive isolation was produced.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=The Evolution of Reproductive Isolation as a Correlated Character Under Sympatric Conditions: Experimental Evidence| first1=William R. | last1=Rice | first2=George W. | last2=Salt | journal=Evolution, Society for the Study of Evolution| year=1990| volume=44 | ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120513233154/http://www.lifesci.ucsb.edu/eemb/faculty/rice/publications/pdf/25.pdf|archivedate=2012-05-13|url= http://www.lifesci.ucsb.edu/eemb/faculty/rice/publications/pdf/25.pdf |title=The Evolution of Reproductive Isolation as a Correlated Character Under Sympatric Conditions: Experimental Evidence |accessdate=2010-05-23 |publisher= William R.

====Gall wasps====
A study of the [[Gall wasp|gall-forming wasp]] species ''Belonocnema treatae'' found that populations inhabiting different host plants (''[[Quercus geminata]]'' and ''[[Quercus virginiana|Q. Virginiana]]'') exhibited different body size and [[gall]] morphology alongside a strong expression of sexual isolation. The study hypothesized that ''B. treatae'' populations inhabiting different host plants would show evidence of [[divergent evolution|divergent selection]] promoting speciation. The researchers sampled gall wasp species and oak tree localities, measured body size (right hand [[tibia]] of each wasp), and counted gall chamber numbers. In addition to measurements, they conducted mating assays and statistical analyses. Genetic analysis was also conducted on two [[mtDNA]] sites (416 base pairs from cytochrome C and 593 base pairs from cytochrome oxidase ) to "control for the confounding effects of time since divergence among [[allopatric speciation|allopatric populations]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Divergent host-plant use promotes reproductive isolation among cynipid gall wasp populations| author=Scott P.

In an additional study, the researchers studied two gall wasp species ''B. treatae'' and ''Disholcaspis quercusvirens'' and found strong morphological and behavioral variation among host-associated populations. This study further confounded prerequisites to speciation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title=Parallel Patterns of Morphological and Behavioral Variation among Host-Associated Populations of Two Gall Wasp Species| author=Egan, Scott P. | journal=PLOS ONE| year=2013| volume=8| issue=1 | pages=e54690| doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0054690 |bibcode=2013PLoSO...854690E |display-authors=etal | pmid=23349952| pmc=3549985}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hawthorn fly====
One example of evolution at work is the case of the hawthorn fly, ''[[Rhagoletis pomonella]]'', also known as the apple maggot fly, which appears to be undergoing [[sympatric speciation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Feder | first1=J.L. | last2=Roethele | first2=J.B. | last3=Filchak | first3=K. | last4=Niedbalski | first4=J. | last5=Romero-Severson | first5=J. |title=Evidence for inversion polymorphism related to sympatric host race formation in the apple maggot fly, Rhagoletis pomonella |journal=Genetics |volume=163 |issue=3 |pages=939–53 |date=1 March 2003|pmid=12663534 |pmc=1462491 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt; Different populations of hawthorn fly feed on different fruits. A distinct population emerged in North America in the 19th century some time after [[apple]]s, a non-native species, were introduced. This apple-feeding population normally feeds only on apples and not on the historically preferred fruit of [[Crataegus|hawthorns]]. The current hawthorn feeding population does not normally feed on apples. Some evidence, such as the fact that six out of thirteen [[allozyme]] loci are different, that hawthorn flies mature later in the season and take longer to mature than apple flies; and that there is little evidence of interbreeding (researchers have documented a 4–6% hybridization rate) suggests that speciation is occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Berlocher | first1=S.H. | last2=Bush | first2=G.L. |title=An electrophoretic analysis of Rhagoletis (Diptera: Tephritidae) phylogeny |journal=Systematic Zoology |volume=31 |issue= 2|pages=136–55 |year=1982 |doi=10.2307/2413033 |jstor=2413033 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Berlocher | first1=S.H. | last2=Feder | first2=J.L. |title=Sympatric speciation in phytophagous insects: moving beyond controversy? |journal=Annu Rev Entomol |volume=47 |pages=773–815 |year=2002 |pmid=11729091 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ento.47.091201.145312 |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Bush | first=G.L. |title=Sympatric host race formation and speciation in frugivorous flies of the genus Rhagoletis (Diptera: Tephritidae) |journal=Evolution |volume=23 |issue= 2|pages=237–51 |year=1969 |doi=10.2307/2406788 |jstor=2406788 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Prokopy | first1=R.J. | last2=Diehl | first2=S.R. | last3=Cooley | first3=S.S. |title=Behavioral evidence for host races in Rhagoletis pomonella flies|jstor=4218647 |journal=[[Oecologia]] |volume=76 |issue=1 |pages=138–47 |year=1988 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/p1716r36n2164855/?p=d8018d5a59294c2984f253b7152445b7&amp;pi=20 |doi=10.1007/BF00379612 | pmid=28312391 |ref=harv|bibcode=1988Oecol..76..138P }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Feder | first1=J.L. | last2=Roethele | first2=J.B. | last3=Wlazlo | first3=B. | last4=Berlocher | first4=S.H. |title=Selective maintenance of allozyme differences among sympatric host races of the apple maggot fly |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=94 |issue=21 |pages=11417–21 |year=1997 |pmid=11038585 |pmc=23485 |doi=10.1073/pnas.94.21.11417|bibcode=1997PNAS...9411417F |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====London Underground mosquito====
The [[London Underground mosquito]] is a species of [[mosquito]] in the genus ''[[Culex]]'' found in the [[London Underground]]. It evolved from the overground species ''Culex pipiens''. This mosquito, although first discovered in the London Underground system, has been found in underground systems around the world. It is suggested that it may have adapted to human-made underground systems since the last century from local above-ground ''Culex pipiens'',&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt; although more recent evidence suggests that it is a southern mosquito variety related to ''Culex pipiens'' that has adapted to the warm underground spaces of northern cities.&lt;ref name="Fonseca"/&gt;

The two species have very different behaviours,&lt;ref name="Burdick"&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m1134/is_1_110/ai_70770157 |title=Insect From the Underground&amp;nbsp;— London, England Underground home to different species of mosquitos |journal=[[Natural History (magazine)|Natural History]] |year=2001 | first=Alan | last=Burdick}}&lt;/ref&gt; are extremely difficult to mate,&lt;ref name="Times"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.gene.ch/gentech/1998/Jul-Sep/msg00188.html |publisher=The Times |date=1998-08-26 |title=London underground source of new insect forms}}&lt;/ref&gt; and with different allele frequency, consistent with genetic drift during a [[founder event]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Byrne | first1=K. | last2=Nichols | first2=R.A. |title=Culex pipiens in London Underground tunnels: differentiation between surface and subterranean populations |journal=Heredity |volume=82 |issue=1 |pages=7–15 |year=1999 |pmid=10200079 |doi=10.1038/sj.hdy.6884120}}&lt;/ref&gt; More specifically, this mosquito, ''Culex pipiens molestus'', breeds all-year round, is cold intolerant, and bites rats, mice, and humans, in contrast to the above ground species ''Culex pipiens'' that is cold tolerant, hibernates in the winter, and bites only birds. When the two varieties were cross-bred the eggs were infertile suggesting reproductive isolation.&lt;ref name="Times"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Burdick"/&gt;

The genetic data indicates that the ''molestus'' form in the London Underground mosquito appears to have a common ancestry, rather than the population at each station being related to the nearest aboveground population (i.e. the ''pipiens'' form). Byrne and Nichols' working hypothesis was that adaptation to the underground environment had occurred locally in London only once. These widely separated populations are distinguished by very minor genetic differences, which suggest that the molestus form developed: a single mtDNA difference shared among the underground populations of ten Russian cities;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| last=Vinogradova | first1=E.B. | last2=Shaikevich | first2=E.V. |title=Morphometric, physiological and molecular characteristics of underground populations of the urban mosquito Culex pipiens Linnaeus f. molestus Forskål (Diptera: Culicidae) from several areas of Russia|url=http://e-m-b.org/sites/e-m-b.org/files/European_Mosquito_Bulletin_Publications811/EMB22/EMB22_04.pdf |journal=European Mosquito Bulletin |volume= 22 |year=2007 |pages=17–24}}&lt;/ref&gt; a single fixed [[Microsatellite (genetics)|microsatellite]] difference in populations spanning Europe, Japan, Australia, the middle East and Atlantic islands.&lt;ref name="Fonseca"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Emerging vectors in the Culex pipiens complex |journal=Science |volume=303 |issue=5663 |pages=1535–8 |year=2004 |pmid=15001783 |doi=10.1126/science.1094247 |url=http://www.mosquitocatalog.org/files/pdfs/wr380.pdf |last1=Fonseca |first1=D.

[[Hybrid (biology)|Hybridization]] between two different species sometimes leads to a distinct phenotype. This phenotype can also be fitter than the parental lineage and as such, natural selection may then favor these individuals. Eventually, if reproductive isolation is achieved, it may lead to a separate species. However, reproductive isolation between hybrids and their parents is particularly difficult to achieve and thus [[hybrid speciation]] is considered a rare event.

Polyploid speciation, which involves changes in chromosome number, is a more common phenomenon, especially in plant species.

Polyploidy is a mechanism that has caused many rapid speciation events in sympatry because offspring of, for example, tetraploid x diploid matings often result in triploid sterile progeny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ramsey |first1=Justin |last2=Schemske |first2=Douglas W. |date=November 1998 |title=Pathways, Mechanisms, and Rates of Polyploid Formation in Flowering Plants |journal=[[Annual Review of Ecology, Evolution, and Systematics|Annual Review of Ecology and Systematics]] |volume=29 |pages=467–501 |doi=10.1146/annurev.ecolsys.29.1.467 |issn=1545-2069}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not all polyploids are reproductively isolated from their parental plants, and gene flow may still occur for example through triploid hybrid x diploid matings that produce tetraploids, or matings between [[meiosis|meiotically unreduced]] gametes from diploids and gametes from tetraploids.

====''Mimulus peregrinus''====
The creation of a new allopolyploid species of monkeyflower ([[Erythranthe peregrina|''Mimulus peregrinus'']]) was observed on the banks of the Shortcleuch Water—a river in Leadhills, South Lanarkshire, Scotland. Parented from the cross of the two species [[Erythranthe guttata|''Mimulus guttatus'']] (containing 14 pairs of chromosomes) and [[Erythranthe lutea|''Mimulus luteus'']] (containing 30-31 pairs from a chromosome duplication), ''M. peregrinus'' has six copies of its chromosomes (caused by the duplication of the sterile hybrid triploid). Due to the nature of these species, they have the ability to self-fertilize. Because of its number of chromosomes it is not able to pair with ''M. guttatus'', ''M. luteus'', or their sterile triploid offspring. ''M. peregrinus'' will either die, producing no offspring, or reproduce with itself effectively leading to a new species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Mimulus peregrinus (Phrymaceae): A new British allopolyploid species| first=Mario | last=Vallejo-Marín| journal=PhytoKeys| year=2012| volume=14| issue=14 | pages=1–14| url=https://www.pensoft.net/journals/phytokeys/article/3305/mimulus-peregrinus-phrymaceae-a-new-british-allopolyploid-species| doi=10.3897/phytokeys.14.3305| pmid=23170069 | pmc=3492922 | accessdate =2014-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Speciation by genome duplication: Repeated origins and genomic composition of the recently formed allopolyploid species Mimulus peregrinus| first1=Mario | last1=Vallejo-Marín| first2=Richard J. | last2=Buggs | first3=Arielle M. | last3=Cooley | first4=Joshua R. | last4=Puzey | journal=Evolution| year=2015| doi=10.1111/evo.12678| volume=69 | issue=6 | pages=1487–1500 | pmid=25929999 | pmc=5033005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Raphanobrassica''====
''[[Raphanobrassica]]'' includes all intergeneric hybrids between the genera ''[[Raphanus]]'' (radish) and ''[[Brassica]]'' (cabbages, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Karpechenko | first1=G.D. | authorlink=Georgii Karpechenko | year=1927 | title=Polyploid hybrids of ''Raphanus sativus'' X ''Brassica oleracea'' L | url=| journal=Bull.

Plants of this parentage are now known as radicole. Two other fertile forms of ''Raphanobrassica'' are known. Raparadish, an allopolyploid hybrid between ''Raphanus sativus'' and ''Brassica rapa'' is grown as a fodder crop. "Raphanofortii" is the allopolyploid hybrid between ''[[Brassica tournefortii]]'' and ''[[Raphanus caudatus]]''. The ''Raphanobrassica'' is a fascinating plant, because (in spite of its hybrid nature), it is not sterile. This has led some botanists to propose that the accidental hybridization of a flower by pollen of another species in nature could be a mechanism of speciation common in higher plants.

====''Senecio'' (groundsel)====
The Welsh groundsel is an allopolyploid, a plant that contains sets of chromosomes originating from two different species. Its ancestor was ''Senecio × baxteri'', an infertile hybrid that can arise spontaneously when the closely related groundsel (''[[Senecio vulgaris]]'') and Oxford ragwort (''[[Senecio squalidus]]'') grow alongside each other. Sometime in the early 20th century, an accidental doubling of the number of chromosomes in an ''S. × baxteri'' plant led to the formation of a new fertile species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.2307/2446125 | title=Origins of the New Allopolyploid Species ''Senecio camrensis (asteracea)'' and its Relationship to the Canary Islands Endemic ''Senecio tenerifae''| first1=Andrew J. | last1=Lowe | first2=Richard J. | last2=Abbott | journal=American Journal of Botany| year=1996| volume=83| pages=1365–1372| issue=10 | jstor=2446125 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Why Evolution is True| first=Jerry A. | last=Coyne |authorlink=Jerry A. Coyne |year=2009| pages=187–189| publisher=Penguin Group| isbn=978-0-670-02053-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[York groundsel]] (''Senecio eboracensis'') is a hybrid species of the [[Self-incompatibility in plants|self-incompatible]] ''[[Senecio squalidus]]'' (also known as Oxford ragwort) and the self-compatible ''[[Senecio vulgaris]]'' (also known as common groundsel). Like ''S. vulgaris'', ''S. eboracensis'' is self-compatible; however, it shows little or no natural crossing with its parent species, and is therefore reproductively isolated, indicating that strong breed barriers exist between this new hybrid and its parents. It resulted from a [[backcrossing]] of the [[F1 hybrid]] of its parents to ''S. vulgaris''. ''S. vulgaris'' is native to Britain, while ''S. squalidus'' was introduced from Sicily in the early 18th century; therefore, ''S. eboracensis'' has speciated from those two species within the last 300 years.

Other hybrids descended from the same two parents are known. Some are infertile, such as ''S.'' x ''baxteri''. Other fertile hybrids are also known, including [[Senecio vulgaris|''S. vulgaris'' var. ''hibernicus'']], now common in Britain, and the [[polyploidy|allohexaploid]] ''[[Senecio cambrensis|S. cambrensis]]'', which according to molecular evidence probably originated independently at least three times in different locations. Morphological and genetic evidence support the status of ''S. eboracensis'' as separate from other known hybrids.&lt;ref name='w3T'&gt;{{cite web | url=http://mobot.mobot.org/cgi-bin/search_pick?name=Senecio+vulgaris | title=TROPICOS Web display ''Senecio vulgaris'' L | accessdate=2008-02-01 | author=Missouri Botanical Garden | authorlink=Missouri Botanical Garden | website=Nomenclatural and Specimen Data Base | publisher=Missouri State Library}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thale cress====
[[File:Arabidopsis thaliana.jpg|thumb|right|150px|'''Figure 6c''': ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]'' (colloquially known as thale cress, mouse-ear cress or arabidopsis)]]
[[Kirsten Bomblies]] et al. from the [[Max Planck Institute for Developmental Biology]] discovered two genes in the thale cress plant, ''[[Arabidopsis thaliana]]''. When both genes are inherited by an individual, it ignites a reaction in the hybrid plant that turns its own immune system against it. In the parents, the genes were not detrimental, but they evolved separately to react defectively when combined.&lt;ref name="Bomblies, Lempe 2007"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Bomblies | year=2007 | title=Autoimmune Response as a Mechanism for a Dobzhansky-Muller-Type Incompatibility Syndrome in Plants | journal=PLoS Biol | volume=5 | issue=9| page=e236 | doi=10.1371/journal.pbio.0050236 | pmid=17803357 | pmc=1964774 | first1=Kirsten | last2=Lempe | first2=Janne | last3=Epple | first3=Petra | last4=Warthmann | first4=Norman | last5=Lanz | first5=Christa | last6=Dangl | first6=Jeffery L. | last7=Weigel | first7=Detlef }}&lt;/ref&gt; To test this, Bomblies crossed 280 genetically different strains of ''Arabidopsis'' in 861 distinct ways and found that 2 percent of the resulting hybrids were necrotic. Along with allocating the same indicators, the 20 plants also shared a comparable collection of genetic activity in a group of 1,080 genes. In almost all of the cases, Bomblies discovered that only two genes were required to cause the autoimmune response. Bomblies looked at one hybrid in detail and found that one of the two genes belonged to the [[Gene-for-gene relationship|NB-LRR class]], a common group of disease resistance genes involved in recognizing new infections. When Bomblies removed the problematic gene, the hybrids developed normally.&lt;ref name="Bomblies, Lempe 2007"/&gt; Over successive generations, these incompatibilities could create divisions between different plant strains, reducing their chances of successful mating and turning distinct strains into separate species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/08/new_plant_species_arise_from_conflicts_between_immune_system.php |title= New plant species arise from conflicts between immune system genes |accessdate= 2010-05-22 |publisher= Ed Yong |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100203103906/http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/08/new_plant_species_arise_from_conflicts_between_immune_system.php |archivedate= 2010-02-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''Tragopogon'' (salsify)====
[[File:Tragopogon porrifolius flower.jpg|thumb|right|150px|'''Figure 6d''': Purple salsify, ''[[Tragopogon porrifolius]]'']]
''[[Tragopogon]]'' is one example where hybrid speciation has been observed. In the early 20th century, humans introduced three species of salsify into North America. These species, the western salsify (''Tragopogon dubius''), the meadow salsify (''Tragopogon pratensis''), and the [[Tragopogon porrifolius|oyster plant]] (''Tragopogon porrifolius''), are now common weeds in urban wastelands. In the 1950s, botanists found two new species in the regions of [[Idaho]] and [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]], where the three already known species overlapped. One new species, ''[[Tragopogon miscellus]]'', is a [[tetraploid]] hybrid of ''T. dubius'' and ''T. pratensis''. The other new species, ''[[Tragopogon mirus]]'', is also an allopolyploid, but its ancestors were ''T. dubius'' and ''T. porrifolius''. These new species are usually referred to as "the Ownbey hybrids" after the botanist who first described them. The ''T. mirus'' population grows mainly by reproduction of its own members, but additional episodes of hybridization continue to add to the ''T. mirus'' population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title= Life, the science of biology | edition=7| first1=William Kirkwood | last1=Purves | first2=David E. | last2=Sadava | first3=Gordon H. | last3=Orians | first4=H.

''T. dubius'' and ''T. pratensis'' mated in Europe but were never able to hybridize. A study published in March 2011 found that when these two plants were introduced to North America in the 1920s, they mated and doubled the number of chromosomes in there hybrid ''Tragopogon miscellus'' allowing for a "reset" of its genes, which in turn, allows for greater genetic variation. Professor Doug Soltis of the [[University of Florida]] said, "We caught evolution in the act…New and diverse patterns of gene expression may allow the new species to rapidly adapt in new environments".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2011-03/uof-urf031611.php| title=UF researcher: Flowering plant study 'catches evolution in the act'| first=Pam | last=Soltis | publisher=EurekAlert, American Association for the Advancement of Science| date=2011-03-17| accessdate=2011-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=Transcriptomic Shock Generates Evolutionary Novelty in a Newly Formed, Natural Allopolyploid Plant| journal=Current Biology| year=2011| volume=21| pages=551–6| doi=10.1016/j.cub.2011.02.016| pmid=21419627 | issue=7 | last1=Buggs | first1=Richard J.A. | last2=Zhang | first2=Linjing | last3=Miles | first3=Nicholas | last4=Tate | first4=Jennifer A. | last5=Gao | first5=Lu | last6=Wei | first6=Wu | last7=Schnable | first7=Patrick S. | last8=Barbazuk | first8=W.

The hybridizations have been reproduced artificially in laboratories from 2004 to present day.

====Blackcap====
The bird species, ''[[Blackcap|Sylvia atricapilla]]'', commonly referred to as blackcaps, lives in Germany and flies southwest to Spain while a smaller group flies northwest to Great Britain during the winter. Gregor Rolshausen from the [[University of Freiburg]] found that the genetic separation of the two populations is already in progress. The differences found have arisen in about 30 generations. With DNA sequencing, the individuals can be assigned to a correct group with an 85% accuracy. Stuart Bearhop from the [[University of Exeter]] reported that birds wintering in England tend to mate only among themselves, and not usually with those wintering in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | year=2005 | title=Assortative mating as a mechanism for rapid evolution of a migratory divide | journal=Science | volume=310 | issue=5747| pages=502–504 | doi=10.1126/science.1115661 | pmid=16239479 | last1=Bearhop | first1=S. | last2=Fiedler | first2=W. | last3=Furness | first3=R.W. | last4=Votier | first4=S.C. | last5=Waldron | first5=S. | last6=Newton | first6=J. | last7=Bowen | first7=G.J. | last8=Berthold | first8=P. | last9=Farnsworth | first9=K. |bibcode=2005Sci...310..502B }} [http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/full/sci;310/5747/502/DC1 Supporting Online Material]&lt;/ref&gt; It is still inference to say that the populations will become two different species, but researchers expect it due to the continued genetic and geographic separation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/12/03/british-birdfeeders-split-blackcaps-into-two-genetically-dis/ |title=British birdfeeders split blackcaps into two genetically distinct groups | first=Ed | last=Yong |date=3 December 2009 |publisher=ScienceBlogs |accessdate=2010-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Mollies====
The shortfin molly (''[[Poecilia|Poecilia mexicana]]'') is a small fish that lives in the [[Lechuguilla Cave|Sulfur Caves]] of Mexico. Years of study on the species have found that two distinct populations of mollies—the dark interior fish and the bright surface water fish—are becoming more genetically divergent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Tobler | first1=Michael | year=2009 | title=Does a predatory insect contribute to the divergence between cave- and surface-adapted fish populations? | journal=Biology Letters | volume= 5| issue=4| pages= 506–509| doi=10.1098/rsbl.2009.0272 | pmid=19443506 | pmc=2781934}}&lt;/ref&gt; The populations have no obvious barrier separating the two; however, it was found that the mollies are hunted by a large water bug (''[[Belostomatidae|Belostoma spp]]''). Tobler collected the bug and both types of mollies, placed them in large plastic bottles, and put them back in the cave. After a day, it was found that, in the light, the cave-adapted fish endured the most damage, with four out of every five stab-wounds from the water bugs sharp mouthparts. In the dark, the situation was the opposite. The mollies' senses can detect a predator's threat in their own habitats, but not in the other ones. Moving from one habitat to the other significantly increases the risk of dying. Tobler plans on further experiments, but believes that it is a good example of the rise of a new species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/05/giant_insect_splits_cavefish_into_distinct_populations.php |title= Giant insect splits cavefish into distinct populations |accessdate= 2010-05-22 |publisher= [[Ed Yong]] |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100201061035/http://scienceblogs.com/notrocketscience/2009/05/giant_insect_splits_cavefish_into_distinct_populations.php |archivedate= 2010-02-01 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polar bears have acquired significant anatomical and physiological differences from the brown bear that allow it to comfortably survive in conditions that the brown bear likely could not. Notable examples include the ability to swim sixty miles or more at a time in freezing waters, fur that blends with the snow, and to stay warm in the arctic environment, an elongated neck that makes it easier to keep their heads above water while swimming, and oversized and heavy-matted webbed feet that act as paddles when swimming. It has also evolved small papillae and vacuole-like suction cups on the soles to make them less likely to slip on the ice, alongside smaller ears for a reduction of heat loss, eyelids that act like sunglasses, accommodations for their all-meat diet, a large stomach capacity to enable opportunistic feeding, and the ability to fast for up to nine months while recycling their urea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.polarbearsinternational.org/about-polar-bears/essentials/evolution |title=Evolution |accessdate=30 January 2014 |publisher=Polar Bears International }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last =Hansman | first =Jared | title=Adaptive Traits of the Polar Bear (Ursus maritimus) | website=| publisher=Helium, Inc. | date =6 August 2008 | url=http://www.sciences360.com/index.php/ursus-maritimus-bears-kodiak-polar-bears-sea-bears-large-mammals-19025/ | format=| doi=| accessdate =30 January 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This example presents a macro-evolutionary change involving an amalgamation of several fields of evolutionary biology, e.g. adaptation through natural selection, geographic isolation, speciation, and hybridization.

==Evidence from coloration==
{{main|Coloration evidence for natural selection}}
[[File:Rock Ptarmigan (Lagopus Muta).jpg|thumb|upright=1.3|[[Natural selection]] has driven the [[Rock ptarmigan|ptarmigan]] to change from [[snow camouflage]] in winter to [[disruptive coloration]] suiting [[moorland]] in summer.&lt;ref name=Tickell/&gt;]]

[[Animal coloration]] provided important early evidence for evolution by natural selection, at a time when little direct evidence was available. Three major functions of coloration were discovered in the second half of the 19th century, and subsequently used as evidence of selection: [[camouflage]] (protective coloration); [[mimicry]], both [[Batesian]] and [[Müllerian mimicry|Müllerian]]; and [[aposematism]]. After the circumstantial evidence provided by Darwin in ''On the Origin of Species'', and given the absence of mechanisms for genetic variation or heredity at that time, naturalists including Darwin's contemporaries, [[Henry Walter Bates]] and [[Fritz Müller]] sought evidence from what they could observe in the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Larson |first=Edward J. |authorlink=Edward J.

===Mimicry and aposematism===
{{further|Mimicry|Aposematism|Anti-predator adaptation}}

Bates and Müller described forms of mimicry that now carry their names, based on their observations of tropical butterflies. These highly specific patterns of coloration are readily explained by natural selection, since predators such as birds which hunt by sight will more often catch and kill insects that are less good mimics of distasteful models than those that are better mimics; but the patterns are otherwise hard to explain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bowler |first=Peter J. |authorlink=Peter J.

===Camouflage===

In 1889, Wallace noted that [[snow camouflage]], especially plumage and pelage that changed with the seasons, suggested an obvious explanation as an adaptation for concealment.&lt;ref name=Wallace&gt;{{cite book |author=Wallace, Alfred Russel |authorlink=Alfred Russel Wallace |title=Darwinism - An Exposition Of The Theory Of Natural Selection - With Some Of Its Applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VaV9CgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT180 |year=2015 |origyear=1889 |publisher=Read Books |isbn=978-1-4733-7510-9 |page=180}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tickell&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tickell |first1=W.

==Evidence from mathematical modeling==

[[Computer science]] allows the [[iteration]] of self-changing [[complex system]]s to be studied, allowing a mathematical understanding of the nature of the processes behind evolution; providing evidence for the hidden causes of known evolutionary events. The evolution of specific cellular mechanisms like [[spliceosome]]s that can turn the cell's genome into a vast workshop of billions of interchangeable parts that can create tools that create tools that create tools that create us can be studied for the first time in an exact way.

"It has taken more than five decades, but the electronic computer is now powerful enough to simulate evolution",&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trnmag.com/Stories/2003/052103/Simulated_evolution_gets_complex_052103.html Simulated Evolution Gets Complex]. Trnmag.com (2003-05-08). Retrieved on 2011-12-06.&lt;/ref&gt; assisting [[bioinformatics]] in its attempt to solve biological problems.

Computational evolutionary biology has enabled researchers to trace the evolution of a large number of organisms by measuring changes in their DNA, rather than through physical taxonomy or physiological observations alone. It has compared entire genomes permitting the study of more complex evolutionary events, such as [[gene duplication]], [[horizontal gene transfer]], and the prediction of factors important in speciation. It has also helped build complex computational models of populations to predict the outcome of the system over time and track and share information on an increasingly large number of species and organisms.

Future endeavors are to reconstruct a now more complex tree of life.

Christoph Adami, a professor at the [[Keck Graduate Institute]] made this point in ''Evolution of biological complexity'':
:To make a case for or against a trend in the evolution of complexity in biological evolution, complexity must be both rigorously defined and measurable. A recent information-theoretic (but intuitively evident) definition identifies genomic complexity with the amount of information a sequence stores about its environment. We investigate the evolution of genomic complexity in populations of digital organisms and monitor in detail the evolutionary transitions that increase complexity. We show that, because natural selection forces genomes to behave as a natural "[[Maxwell's Demon|Maxwell Demon]]", within a fixed environment, genomic complexity is forced to increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Adami | first1=C. | last2=Ofria | first2=C. | last3=Collier | first3=T.C. |title=Evolution of biological complexity |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=97 |issue=9 |pages=4463–8 |year=2000 |pmid=10781045 |pmc=18257 |doi=10.1073/pnas.97.9.4463|arxiv=physics/0005074 |bibcode=2000PNAS...97.4463A}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David J. Earl and Michael W. Deem—professors at [[Rice University]] made this point in ''Evolvability is a selectable trait'':
:Not only has life evolved, but life has evolved to evolve. That is, correlations within protein structure have evolved, and mechanisms to manipulate these correlations have evolved in tandem. The rates at which the various events within the hierarchy of evolutionary moves occur are not random or arbitrary but are selected by Darwinian evolution. Sensibly, rapid or extreme environmental change leads to selection for greater evolvability. This selection is not forbidden by causality and is strongest on the largest-scale moves within the mutational hierarchy. Many observations within evolutionary biology, heretofore considered evolutionary happenstance or accidents, are explained by selection for evolvability. For example, the vertebrate immune system shows that the variable environment of antigens has provided selective pressure for the use of adaptable codons and low-fidelity polymerases during [[somatic hypermutation]]. A similar driving force for biased codon usage as a result of productively high mutation rates is observed in the hemagglutinin protein of [[Influenzavirus A|influenza A]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Earl | first1=D.J. | last2=Deem | first2=M.W. |title=Evolvability is a selectable trait |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=101 |issue=32 |pages=11531–6 |year=2004|pmid=15289608 |pmc=511006 |doi=10.1073/pnas.0404656101|arxiv=q-bio/0407012 |bibcode=2004PNAS..10111531E}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Computer simulations of the evolution of linear sequences have demonstrated the importance of recombination of blocks of sequence rather than point mutagenesis alone. Repeated cycles of point mutagenesis, recombination, and selection should allow ''in vitro'' molecular evolution of complex sequences, such as proteins."&lt;ref name=Stemmer94&gt;{{cite journal | last=Stemmer | first=W.P. |title=DNA shuffling by random fragmentation and reassembly: in vitro recombination for molecular evolution |journal=Proc Natl Acad Sci USA |volume=91 |issue=22 |pages=10747–51 |year=1994 |pmid=7938023 |pmc=45099 |doi=10.1073/pnas.91.22.10747|bibcode=1994PNAS...9110747S}}&lt;/ref&gt; Evolutionary molecular engineering, also called directed evolution or ''in vitro'' molecular evolution involves the iterated cycle of mutation, multiplication with recombination, and selection of the fittest of individual molecules (proteins, DNA, and RNA).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="75682">'''Financial Gerontology''' is a multidisciplinary field of study encompassing both academic and professional education, that integrates research on aging and human development with the concerns of finance and business. Following from its roots in [[social gerontology]], Financial Gerontology is not simply the study of ''old people'' but emphasizes the '''multiple processes''' of aging. In particular, research and teaching in financial gerontology draws upon ''four kinds of aging'' or "'four lenses" through which aging and finance can be viewed: '''population aging''', '''individual aging''', '''family aging''', and '''generational aging'''.&lt;ref&gt;Cutler, N. E., ''Advising Mature Clients: The New Science of Wealth Span Planning.'' Wiley 2002, chapter 1.&lt;/ref&gt;  While it is problematic that "demography is destiny," demographic concepts, issues, and data play a substantial role in understanding the dynamics of financial gerontology. For example, through the lens of population aging, demography identifies the number of persons of different ages in cities and countries—and at multiple points in time. Through the lens of individual aging, demography also notes changes in the length of time--number of years lived in older age, typically measured by increases in life expectancy. From in its founding years in the beginning of the 21st century, one primary interest of Financial Gerontology has been on [[baby boomer]]s and their relationships with their parents. The impact of these two kinds of aging on finance are reasonably apparent. The large and increasing number of older persons  [&lt;nowiki/&gt;[[population aging]]] in a society, no matter how "old age" is defined, and the longer each of these persons lives [individual aging], the greater the impact on a society's pattern of [[retirement]], public and private [[pension]] systems, health, health care, and the [[health care finance in the United States|personal and societal financing of health care]]. The focus on boomers illustrates also the other two lenses or "kinds" of aging. How boomers deal with the social, emotional, and financial aspects of their parents' aging is a central aspect of [[Family support|family aging.]] And how boomers may differ from their parents born and raised twenty to forty years earlier, and differ from their Generation X and Millennial children and grandchildren, are substantial aspects of [[Theory of generations|generational]] aging.

== Origins of Financial Gerontology ==
=== The Educational Vision ===
The origins of Financial Gerontology reflect the vision of two business professionals, Joseph Boettner, a successful insurance salesman and entrepreneur, and Davis Gregg, a successful business educator and administrator. Boettner was born in 1903 and left West Philadelphia High School to work in the city's booming insurance industry. Building from a successful career in sales he purchased the failing Philadelphia Life Insurance Company (for $1 per share), and established it as a successful company. Boettner's post-high school education was with the American College of Life Underwriters, then an insurance education program within the University of Pennsylvania's Wharton School of Business &amp; Finance; he earned his Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU) designation in 1934. Born in 1918, Gregg graduated from the University of Texas and earned his PhD from the University of Pennsylvania in 1947, where he studied under the legendary professor of insurance [[Solomon S. Huebner|Solomon Huebner]], the founder of the American College of Life Underwriters and considered by many to be the "father of insurance education"&lt;ref&gt;Stone, M.F., ''The Teacher Who Changed an Industry,'' Richard D. Irwin Inc, 1960.&lt;/ref&gt; Gregg was on the faculty of Stanford University when Huebner asked him to come to the insurance college in Philadelphia for a short time. The "short time" became four decades including thirty years (1954 to 1983) as the college's president.

Combining his wealth and continuing interest in financial education, Boettner made several investments in higher education, including endowing academic chairs primarily in the realm of life insurance programs. As both his business perspectives and his experience with personal aging evolved, however, his views about the educational needs of the insurance industry also changed. Although his own resources allowed him to respond successfully to the financial challenges of aging, he became increasingly concerned about how the average person can deal with aging and, of equal significance, how educational programs could be created to respond to the needs and concerns of aging persons.  Over the years Gregg's intellectual experience as dean and president encouraged him to expand the college's distance education curriculum beyond the CLU designation which focused substantially on life insurance. Under his leadership the college developed a second professional designation, the [[Chartered Financial Consultant|Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC)]] whose approach included financial planning courses beyond life insurance .

By the 1980s Boettner's concerns about personal aging and financial education began to merge with Gregg's views on the need for more comprehensive professional education in the expanding field of financial services. A result of these joint concerns was the concept and a plan for a new research institute that would focus on the interconnections among social gerontology and personal finance. With a small gift from Boettner, Gregg convened a study committee of nationally known gerontologists which, after two years of assessment, agreed on four organizing principles: (1) that there was in fact a need for specialized research that integrates gerontology and financial planning; (2) that a social gerontology research center could succeed at a small specialized business school; (3) that the permanent director of the institute should be an experienced gerontologist because the financial side of the relationship would be provided by the business school's faculty; and (4) that the new institute would be communicating gerontological concerns to financial professionals and financial concerns to gerontologists.

On July 4, 1986 [[The American College of Financial Services|American College]] established the Boettner Research Institute under Gregg's supervision. Its first permanent director was Dr. Neal E. Cutler, a professor of political science and gerontology, recruited in 1989 from the University of Southern California's [[USC Davis School of Gerontology|Andrus Gerontology Center]]. A challenge of the new leadership team was to create a more content-descriptive name for the institute. A pensions or retirement institute was considered, but this was somewhat narrower than the mandate of the new institute; further, the Wharton School at the nearby University of Pennsylvania already had a well-established Pensions Research Council. More critically, the new institute was to be unique in emphasizing the contributions of gerontology to a broad range of academic fields and financial professionals. Fortunately, as models there are several well-recognized gerontological interdisciplinary sub-fields, including biological gerontology, social gerontology, occupational gerontology, and recreational gerontology; and the phrase "financial gerontology" was starting to be seen in professional publications.&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, D.W., "Introducing Financial Gerontology," ''Journal of the American Society of CLU &amp; ChFC'', November 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Consequently, in 1990 "Boettner Institute of Financial Gerontology" was chosen as the official name in order both to create new sub-fields in both gerontology and in finance, and to describe and communicate the institute's scope of academic and professional education and research.

The initial professional and public recognition of the significance of Financial Gerontology was substantial, and to some extent exceeded the expectations of its organizers and advisers. In response, the desirability of a broader set of academic supports than originally planned was identified. In 1992 the Boettner Institute of Financial Gerontology became chartered as a nonprofit charitable educational corporation with an independently appointed board of trustees of prominent business and gerontology academics and practitioners. The same year, the trustees voted to move the institute from The American College and accept an invitation to become affiliated with the University of Pennsylvania School of Arts &amp; Sciences.&lt;ref&gt;Vitt, L.A and Siegenthaler, J.A (eds.), ''Encyclopedia of Financial Gerontology,'' Greenwood Press 1996, "Boettner Center of Financial Gerontology," pp.51-55&lt;/ref&gt; In order to establish that the foundations of Financial Gerontology were both to learn from and speak to the disciplines of gerontology and financial services, the Boettner Institute organized a series of published lectures given by renown experts in the "two sides" of Financial Gerontology. The inaugural lecture was given in 1997 by Dr. George L. Maddox, Director of the Duke University Center for the Study of Aging and Human Development: "Age and Well-Being." Other lectures included:
Dr. William C. Greenough, CEO of [[TIAA|TIAA-CREF]] and developer of the variable-annuity stock fund: "Critical Policy Issues for Pensions" (1989).
Dr. [[Matilda White Riley]], Director of the Office of Social and Behavioral Science, National Institute of Aging: "Aging in the Twenty-first Century" (1990).
Dr. Davis W. Gregg, Founding Director of the Boettner Institute: "The Human Wealth Span: A Life Span View of Financial Well-Being" (1992).
Dr. [[James Birren|James E. Birren]], psychologist and founding director of the [[USC Davis School of Gerontology|USC Andrus Gerontology Center]]: "Information and Consumer Decisions-Making: Maintaining Resources and Independence"(1994).
Dallas L. Salisbury, CEO of the [[Employee Benefit Research Institute]]: "Recent Trends in Pensions, Benefits, and Retirement: In-House Research" (1995).

In keeping with its established academic naming practices, the University of Pennsylvania renamed the Institute as the Boettner Center of Financial Gerontology. In 2003 the Center was moved into the university's Wharton School as the Boettner Center for Pensions and Retirement Research affiliated with the business school's [[Olivia S. Mitchell|Pension Research Council]], under the direction of Dr. Olivia S. Mitchell. The Wharton School is also home to one of the two (see below) Boettner-funded endowed chairs in Financial Gerontology.

== Financial Gerontology as Academic Teaching and Research ==

===The Human Wealth Span===
Early Financial Gerontology research focused on the interaction of (and longitudinal trends in) middle-aging and older-aging, and their combined impact on savings, retirement, health care, and long-term care. Research on aging and money often juxtaposes '''''old age''''' with the adequacy of financial resources ([[pension]]s, [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]], and a variety of [[Retirement plans in the United States|savings and investment approaches]], often referred to as the "three legged stool",&lt;ref&gt;Social Security Administration, "Origins of the Three-Legged Stool Metaphor for Social Security," https://www.ssa.gov/history/stool.html, May 1996&lt;/ref&gt; to support the quality of personal and family later life. The integration of '''''middle age''''' as an essential dimension of Financial Gerontology reflected Gregg's and Cutler's conceptualization of the "Human Wealth Span" introduced in 1991-1992&lt;ref&gt;Cutler, N.E. and Gregg, D.W., "The Human Wealth Span and Financial Well-Being in Older Age," ''Generations,'' Winter 1992&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gregg, D.W., "The Human Wealth Span: A Life-Span View of Financial Well-Being," Boettner Lecture, Boettner Institute of Financial Gerontology, University of Pennsylvania, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; As Gregg noted in his 1992 Boettner Lecture, the Human Wealth Span "mirrors" the better known Human Life Span concept which speaks not only to patterns of maturation and aging, but also to identifiable stages in human development.

An especially important additional link in the etiology of the Wealth Span is the emphasis on the '''''Health''''' '''''Span''''' in [[John Rowe (Aetna)|Rowe]] and [[Robert L. Kahn|Kahn]]'s conceptualization of '''[[successful aging]]''', especially the connection between health span stages, health behavior and, thereby, "successful aging." In terms of stages, it is apparent that health behavior choices made earlier affect health status and outcomes later in life. Rowe and Kahn&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Successful Aging|last=Rowe, J.W. and Kahn, R.L.|first=|publisher=Random House|year=1998|isbn=0-440-50863-0|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; emphasize in this regard, however, that while it is better to start early and always have good health behaviors, even starting such behaviors later life can affect and improve health. For example, both cessation of smoking or "pumping iron" in one's 60s or 70s can have beneficial effects. Drawing on these insights, the wealth span representation of the life span in financial terms emphasizes two stages: the '''accumulation stage''' and the '''expenditure stage''', which are somewhat correlated with developmental-maturational stages. Traditionally, people accumulate wealth in their younger and middle-aged, years, and spend that wealth in their later retirement years. Clearly, as [[Franco Modigliani|Modigliani's]] [[Life-cycle hypothesis|life-cycle saving-spending hypothesis]] illustrates, this is a purposeful simplification of a complex life span dynamic; many people continue to (work and) accumulate in their older years just as, of course, younger and middle-aged persons spend during the accumulation years of their wealth span.

==== Changes in Balance ====
Beyond a concern with the stages of accumulation and expenditure, the wealth span model offers two valuable tools of analysis useful for both academic research and financial practice: (1) changes in the balance between the accumulation stage and the expenditure stage, and (2) increases in the complexity of each of the two stages.&lt;ref&gt;Cutler, N.E., ''Advising Mature Clients: The New Science of Wealth Span Planning,'' Wiley 2002, chapters 5 and 6.&lt;/ref&gt; '''B''alance''''' here refers to the number of years in each of the two stages. The usual assumption for financial planning and financial well-being in later life is that the accumulation years provide the wealth for the expenditure years. Basically (but more complex in real life) the event or act of retirement is the behavioral fulcrum that conceptually divides an individual's wealth span into the accumulation years vs. the expenditure years. Compared to the first decades of the twentieth century when many men and women dropped out of high school or earlier to work, since the 1950s most Americans stay in school (high school, college, graduate school) longer than before, thereby reducing the number of years in accumulation stage. Similarly, the number of accumulation years is reduced due to early retirement. As the history of work and retirement during the past seventy years demonstrates, patterns of retirement in the U.S. have shifted, with the strong preferences for early retirement seen during the second half of the 20th century now easing as increasing numbers of older workers (older boomers) remain in or return to the labor force.&lt;ref&gt;Employee Benefit Research Institute,"Work-Force Participation Remains Strong Among Older Workers, Driven by Women," ''News from EBRI'', April 16, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; By itself a shorter accumulation stage tells only part of the story. At the same time, across the twentieth century life expectancy has increased substantially resulting in a longer expenditure stage. From the perspective of Financial Gerontology such a shift means that people have fewer years to accumulate and what has been accumulated must last for a longer number of expenditure years. Of course, the fulcrum between the two stages (i.e., the act of retirement) can and has been changing as, in recent years, fewer middle-age and older workers are opting for early retirement. Thus, while it is unlikely that older-age life expectancy will dramatically decline to shorten the expenditure stage, social policy and individual choice do influence the number of years in both the accumulation and expenditure stages. The wealth span model simply provides context, identifies the components, and directs attention to the dynamic interaction between and among them.

====Changes in Complexity====

During the same decades in which the balance between the number of years in the two stages has been changing, the '''''complexity''''' within both the accumulation stage and the expenditure stage also has been increasing. In particular, the well-documented improvements in life expectancy in the United States--including older-age life expectancy as well as life expectancy at birth--has increased the complexity of the wealth span, both accumulation opportunities and expenditure responsibilities, in at least three substantial ways: health care and health care finance, pensions and retirement finance, and family-financial behaviors. First, the more direct impact of greater longevity on finance focuses on health—including both investing in personal health behaviors that anticipate old-age [[Elderly care|health issues]], and [[Medicare (United States)|the financing of health care in later life]]. In the U.S. this includes an accumulation stage planning focus on insurance, involving private [[Health insurance in the United States|health care insurance]], [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]], and the emergence of [[long-term care]] and [[long-term care insurance]]. With rising societal and individual health care costs, both the accumulation stage and expenditure stage of the wealth span have become more complex.

A second cluster of expanded wealth span complexities centers on the substantial changes in the U.S. pension or "retirement income" system. In addition to the national Social Security system which provides some basic retirement income for almost all workers, almost half (46%) of all private sector workers also have an employer-sponsored pension. The increasing wealth span complexity, however, is found in the dramatic change in the [[Pensions in the United States|kind of pensions]] held by American workers: [[Defined benefit pension plan|Defined Benefit]] (DB plans) vs. [[Defined contribution plan|Defined Contribution]] (DC plans) pension plans. While the discussion of these types of pensions is discussed in detail elsewhere, it is the fundamental difference in what is "defined"—that is, what is "guaranteed" to the worker in the expenditure stage—that produces the substantial increases in complexity. Conceptually, DB plans define, or largely guarantee, the number of dollars the worker will receive after retirement. It is the employer, primarily, who is responsible for contributing the necessary funds into the plan (sometimes but not always with contributions from the employee). In other words, it is the "output" of pension money that is defined or guaranteed. By contrast, in DC plans, it is only the "input" of contributions into the pension plan that is defined or guaranteed in advance. In many DC plans the employee contributes a specified amount (or percentage) to his/her pension account and the employer matches the amount (in some cases only the employee or only the employer make the contributions). In all these cases, however, the later-life "output" of money to the retiree is based on how well, how successful, the contributed funds have been invested. The magnitude of changes in wealth span complexity precipitated by the shift from Defined Benefit to Defined Contribution plans is illustrated by the clarity of the shift from 1979 to 2013, documented by the U.S. Pension Benefit Guaranty Corporation and reported by the Employee Benefit Research Institute:&lt;ref&gt;Employee Benefit Research Institute, FAQs About Benefits--Retirement Issues. https://www.ebri.org/publications/benfaq/index.cfm?fa=retfaq14&lt;/ref&gt; in 1979 28% of private sector workers had a DB pension and only 7% had a DC pension (and 10% had both); by 2013, only 2% had a DB pension and 33% had a DC pension (and 11% had both).

Third, a separate but intertwined expenditure issue focuses on family aging—the degree to which longevity has changed the '''age structure of the family''' with substantial implications for the financial relationships between and among family members. When we say that "people are living longer" we are also saying that parents are living longer. The 1980s concept of the '''[[sandwich generation]]'''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brody|first=E. M.|year=1981|title=Women in the Middle and Family Help to Older People|url=|journal=Gerontologist|volume=October 1981|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; focused on forty-year-olds (usually women) simultaneously taking care of their sixty-five-year old parents and their babies and toddlers. Greater longevity is accompanied by the emergence, however, of the '''''senior'' ''sandwich'' generation''' in which sixty-year-olds are now the family generation in the middle taking care of (socially and financially) their ninety-year old parents alongside caring for their teenage and young-adult children.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wassel|first=J.I.|year=2006|title=Financial Planning and the Senior Sandwich Generation|url=|journal=Journal of Financial Service Professionals|volume=60|pages=22–26|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wassel , J.I. and Cutler, N.E.|first=|year=2016|title=Yet Another Boomer Challenge for Financial Professionals: The 'Senior' Sandwich Generation|url=|journal=Journal of Financial Service Professionals|volume=70|pages=61–73|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These demographically and financiallynew "senior sandwich" responsibilities of middle-agers can have substantial impact on their expenditure stage years, as they are now caring for elderly parents just as they are planning for and entering their own later life. Simultaneously, anticipation of these responsibilities can also add complexity to their accumulation stage planning. While the wealth span model is primarily an individual-level construct, financing health care and middle-age care for elderly parents are substantial issues of macro financial-social policy as well as of individual behavior.

Over the past century substantial changes in complexity have affected both the accumulation and expenditure stages of the wealth span. The increased complexity of the expenditure stage is dramatically evidenced by the fundamental demographic facts of increasing life expectancy which, at base, means spending over a longer number of years. Clearly the largest set of complexities precipitated by greater longevity are seen in older age health, cultural and scientific responses to health and aging, and of course the personal and societal financing of health care—including [[Health insurance in the United States|health care insurance]]. [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] in particular, and the emergence of [[long-term care]], illustrate the macro [[Health care finance in the United States|financial]] and [[Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act|political]] dimensions of the individual consequences of an evolving wealth span. Further exacerbating this complexity, senior sandwich generation responsibilities extend the personal financial impact of older-age longevity to the middle-age children of elderly parents. For example, In 1900 only 39 percent of persons age 50 had one surviving parent, rising to 80 percent by 2000. Further, in 1900 only 7 percent of 60-year olds had even one parent alive, rising to 49 percent by 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uhlenberg, P.I.|first=|year=1996|title=Mortality Decline in the Twentieth Century and Supply of Kin Over the Life Course|url=|journal=Gerontologist|volume=36|pages=681–685|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Endowed Chairs in Financial Gerontology ===
Joseph E. Boettner, the successful high school educated insurance executive, directed a substantial portion of his wealth to higher education. His earlier gifts reflected his close involvement with the administration and finance of life insurance, especially as a central element in estate planning. With his support, in 1966 Temple University established The Joseph E. Boettner Chair of Risk Management and Insurance. The endowment currently supports not only a distinguished professorship but also scholarships for students seeking the MBA degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.fox.temple.edu/research/endowed-professorships/|title=Fox Research Endowed Professorships|last=Temple University|first=Fox School of Business|date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over the decades during which he worked with his colleague and great friend Dr. Davis Gregg (he called Gregg his "little brother") Boettner came to publicly recognize the importance of creating stronger linkages among life insurance, financial planning, and the science of gerontology. Together Boettner and Gregg also acknowledged that the emerging field of Financial Gerontology would develop best through both a research agenda (i.e., the Boettner Institute) and university programs that support both academic and professional education.

Since 1975 Boettner had been a Trustee of [[Widener University]] in Chester, Pennsylvania, outside Philadelphia. In addition to academic programs he supported development of the campus including a gift that produced Boettner Hall, an undergraduate apartment residence. It was agreed that the new Boettner Chair would be located at Widener. On October 29, 1993, Boettner's "little brother" (fifteen years his junior) passed away. Respecting Boettner's wishes the new Widener Chair was named the Boettner-Gregg Chair in Financial Gerontology. Also with Widener's support, in 1994 Dr. Neal Cutler, who had been Director of the Boettner Center at Penn, was named as the first holder of the Boettner-Gregg Chair. Joseph Boettner died on October 27, 1994.

The Chair at Widener continues as part of the School of Business Administration, currently known as the Boettner Endowed Professor in Financial Planning, held by Kenn B. Tacchino, a professor of taxation and financial planning. Since 1992 the Boettner Center of Financial Gerontology has been part of the Wharton School at the University of Pennsylvania. In addition to the Center the Boettner resources now support a Wharton professorship, first known as the Joseph E. and Ruth E. Boettner Professor of Financial Gerontology, and held by Dr. Beth J. Soldo, a demographer and sociologist who was also Director of the Boettner Center. It is currently known as the Boettner Professorship, held by Dr. Kent Smetters, a professor of business economics in the Wharton School Department of Business Economics and Public Policy.

===The Emerging Literature of Financial Gerontology===
One hallmark of the institutionalization of a new academic field or subfield is the development of "its own" literature. To be sure, there are countless publications in the academic disciplines of finance and gerontology that refer to money and aging. The four kinds of aging noted earlier—population aging, individual aging, family aging, and generational aging—each identify multiple linkages among aging processes, older men and women, money, and finance that are the focus of academic publications in their respective disciplines. The new field of Financial Gerontology emphasizes closer connections among the scholars, professionals, and writings of the separate fields. The intent, as well as the integration, travels in both directions: to expand the understanding of gerontology among financial professionals and to further illustrate the complexities of finance to gerontologists. This integration is well illustrated by an emerging literature of Financial Gerontology that has been developing over the last twenty-five years, including articles, books, and special issues of academic journals.

The 1992 volume, ''Aging, Money, and Life Satisfaction: Aspects of Financial Gerontology,''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Aging, Money, and Life Satisfaction: Aspects of Financial Gerontology|last=Cutler, N.E., Gregg, D.W., and Lawton, M.P.|first=|publisher=Springer Publishing|year=1992|isbn=0-8261-7700-X|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a first publication of the Boettner Institute, includes an overview of new field plus the first series of annual Boettner Lectures (detailed above in the "Boettner Institute of Financial Gerontology" section). Of special note is the '''wealth span''' model discussed in Davis Gregg's demonstration of how the concepts of life span and health span lead directly to an understanding of financial well-being in later life. The wealth span concept is drawn from Nobel prize-winning economist [[Franco Modigliani|Franco Modigliani's]] [[Life-cycle hypothesis|life cycle saving-spending hypothesis]] and became a continuing aspect of the Boettner Institute's research and teaching, as noted earlier.

A major contribution to the development of the literature of Financial Gerontology was the publication in 1996 of the ''Encyclopedia of Financial Gerontology''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Financial Gerontology|last=Vitt, L.A. and Siegenthaler, J.K.|first=|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=1996|isbn=0-313-28549-7|location=Westport, CT|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Dr. Lois Vitt and Dr. Jurg Siegenthaler. The one-volume publication includes over 150 authors each providing a two- to five-page article on a subject relevant to one of eight core topics: Economic and Income Security; Employment, Work, and Retirement; Family and Intergenerational Issues; Financial Advice, Investments, and Consumer Services; Health Care and Health Insurance; Housing and Housing Finance; Legal Issues and Services; Quality of Life and Well-Being. As an [[encyclopedia]], the organization is of course alphabetical, ranging literally from Accelerated Death Benefits to Zoning. To enhance pedagogical value to educators, however, each of the 150+ articles is listed under one of the eight core topics at the front of the volume. To enhance value to researchers, each article includes a short bibliography plus a number of "see also" references to other articles in the collection. Finally, given the broad multidisciplinary nature of the developing field of Financial Gerontology, including the non-standardization of several disciplinary vocabularies, the encyclopedia includes a massively detailed 40-page index in which such subjects as "assets," "consumer protection," or "employment" are included in multiple articles.

In 2003, an expanded edition of the encyclopedia was published under the title ''Encyclopedia of Retirement and Finance''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Retirement and Finance|last=Vitt, L.A.|first=|publisher=Greenwood Press|year=2003|isbn=0-313-32495-6|location=Westport, CT|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; edited by Dr. Lois Vitt. The number of authors, articles, and core topics were all increased, resulting in a substantial two-volume encyclopedia. While a core purpose continued to be as a resource for researchers and teachers, the new edition signals the growth of Financial Gerontology as a component of professional education. [See "Financial Gerontology as Professional Education" below.] As Dr. Vitt writes in the Preface: "My experience in consumer financial education during the past several years led to this revised edition, which has been expanded to include many additional topics about preretirement and retirement issues. Included in the new edition are entries that span the array of employer sponsored health and retirement benefits, which are increasingly central to working Americans and to their partners and family members. There is a great need for this financial knowledge to reach the many professionals who advise, support, sell products to, serve, assist, and teach mid-life and later-life clients."

In 2002 the J.K. LasserPro division of Wiley published the first textbook in Financial Gerontology, under the title ''Advising Mature Clients: The New Science of Wealth Span Planning.''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Advising Mature Clients: The New Science of Wealth Span Planning.|last=Cutler, N.E.|first=|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2002|isbn=0-471-41470-0|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book builds on two of the key Financial Gerontology concepts mentioned earlier: (1) the wealth span, including its accumulation stage and expenditure stage, and (2) the four "lenses" or kinds of aging: individual aging, population aging, family aging, and generational aging. The wealth span concept builds on Rowe and Kahn's ideas of "health span" and successful aging. As Cutler notes, just as good health habits can start at any time but should start early in life, so too can good financial habits start any time but better begun early. Following a detailed review of the different "kinds" of aging the book focuses directly on the how changes in the stages of the wealth span affect individual financial attitudes and behavior. Chapter 5 focuses on the changing "balance" in years between the accumulation stage (fewer years due to personal preferences and public policies) favoring early retirement, and the expenditure stage (more years due to increasing longevity). Of perhaps greater significance (Chapter 6) are three interrelated dimensions of increasing complexity of the accumulation stage: (1) the trend toward multiple sources of later-life income which an individual or family is likely to have (e.g., an individual retirement account, an employer-based pension, Social Security, personal investments and savings, home equity); (2) the dramatic move from Defined Benefit pensions ("'''''they are responsible''''' for my future retirement income") to Defined Contribution pensions ("'''''I am''''' '''''responsible''''' for my future retirement income"); (3) increasing family-connected financial complexities (nowadays a 62-year-old is more likely than in prior decades to have one or more surviving 87-year-old parents).

The textbook also includes chapters on the multiple meanings of "middle" when talking about the financial psychology of middle age, as well as chapters on health insurance, long-term care, and reverse mortgages. Not surprisingly, much of the data and some of the issues surrounding, for example, Medicare (e.g., there was no Medicare Part D in 2002), Medicaid, long-term care insurance, and nursing home cost data, are out of date. Conversely, the key concepts surrounding the wealth span model (such as changes in the accumulation stage and the expenditure stage) remain relevant as the demographic, personal, and policy context of finance and aging becomes more complex. In this regard, speaking as much to undergraduates as to financial professionals, Chapter 1 identifies four Principles of Financial Gerontology that are relatively independent of the "current" state of aging and finance: (1) Gerontology is not the study of old people.  (2) Financial decisions are family decisions.  (3) Wealth Span interventions are better when made earlier but can work at any age.  (4) The Wealth Span adviser, as a trusted family adviser, will be called upon to--and should be educationally equipped to--provide non-financial guidance. (p.&amp;nbsp;6).

In addition to the development of text and handbooks, the broader academic and interdisciplinary recognition of a new field or subfield is evidenced also by the publication of special topical issues of major disciplinary journals. The American Society on Aging [ASA]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=www.asaging.org/about-asa|last=American Society on Aging|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is one of the two major multidisciplinary membership organizations in the United States focusing on issues of aging. [The older, slightly larger organization is the [[Gerontological Society of America]], founded in 1945, which has separate divisions for biological-medical science, behavioral sciences, and social practice.] Founded in 1954, the ASA's membership of 5,000 professionals includes educators and researchers alongside service providers, program administrators, business executives, policy makers, and students. Each issue of the ASA's widely-read journal, ''Generations,'' typically focuses on a single research or policy issue, offering a dozen or more articles plus bibliographical resources. The Summer 1997 issue of ''Generations'' (volume XXI, no. 2) was titled "Financial Dimensions of Aging." The twelve articles introduced the relatively new field of Financial Gerontology to a new audience of professionals. Subjects included the history of retirement security, economic diversity, boomers as young middle-agers compared to their parents at the same age (in 1997 boomers were only 33 to 51 years old), financial literacy, and an assessment of the Social Security crisis of the day.

The Winter 2004-05 issue of ''Generations'' (volume XXVII, no. 4), titled "Silver Industries," provided a more focused business and aging view of Financial Gerontology. Here the emphasis was on how specific industries and products are being developed in response to aging individuals and aging society. Introductory articles included a brief history of the evolving link between business and aging, generational differences in the psychology of the older consumer, and the marketing challenges in reaching older consumers. Most of the seventeen articles, however, focused on the relationship of aging to specific industries, including: the pharmaceutical industry, financial services, automobiles, moving services, venture capital, and the ''[[personal digital assistant]]'' (forerunner of today's smartphones). The Silver Industries construct continues to be an important dimension of Financial Gerontology, including for example,''The Silver Market Phenomenon: Marketing and Innovation in the Aging Society''&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Silver Market Phenomenon: Marketing and Innovation in the Aging Society|last=Kohlbacher, F. and Herstatt, C. (eds.)|first=|publisher=Springer|year=2008|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Financial Gerontology as Professional Education ==

===The Bimonthly Financial Gerontology Column===
The ''Journal of Financial Service Professionals,'' established in 1946, published bimonthly, is the official journal of the Society of Financial Service Professionals. The Society, established in 1927, was the de facto alumni association of the American College of Life Underwriters (known currently as [[The American College of Financial Services]]) whose primary insurance education designations are the Chartered Life Underwriter (CLU) and more recently the Chartered Financial Consultant (ChFC). Hence, the original name of the journal was the ''Journal of the American Society of CLU and ChFC.'' In addition to longer articles submitted on a range of financial, legal, and administrative topics, each issue of the journal includes several continuing "Departments." These bimonthly research and professional practice reviews and tutorials include such continuing topics as Accounting &amp; Taxation, Social Security Planning, Ethics, Practice Management, Estate Planning, Technology, Health Insurance, Risk Management, and Advice for the New Planner. In the November 1990 issue of the ''Journal of the American Society of CLU and ChFC,'' President-Emeritus of the American College of Life Underwriters, Davis W. Gregg, Ph.D, introduced a new continuing column ("Department") titled "Financial Gerontology" with his essay on the Human Wealth Span.

The first "permanent" author of the column was Dr. Neal E. Cutler, the recently installed Director of the Boettner Institute of Financial Gerontology (described earlier). His first column was also published in the November 1990 issue of the journal, alongside Dr. Gregg's introduction. Dr. Cutler authored the column for a quarter-century (bimonthly through 1997 and every other bimonthly column through March 2016). During these years, guest authors and co-authors included Dr. Harry R. ("Rick") Moody, Director of Academic Affairs at the AARP; Dr. Janice I. Wassel, Director of The Gerontology Program at the University of North Carolina at Greensboro; Dr. Robert C. Atchley, Director of the Scripps Gerontology Center at the Miami University of Ohio; and Dr. Steven J. Devlin, a former vice-provost at Lehigh University.

The second permanent author of the Financial Gerontology column, sharing the bimonthly writing with Dr. Cutler beginning in 1997, was and is Dr. Sandra Timmermann. Dr. Timmermann is a gerontologist who focuses on educational outreach especially in the areas of business, care-giving, long-term care, and adult housing. A recipient of the American Society on Aging's Cavanagh Award for Excellence in Education and Training, Dr. Timmermann was Executive Director of the MetLife Mature Market Institute from 1997 to 2013. She is currently Adjunct Professor of Gerontology at the American College of Financial Services. Following Dr. Cutler's "retirement" from the column, Dr. John N. Migliaccio was selected by the Journal as the third permanent author of "Financial Gerontology" sharing the bimonthly schedule with Dr. Timmermann. Dr. Migliaccio is President of Maturing Mark Services company, a planning and research consultancy working with financial and social services companies and agencies. He is adjunct faculty in the DePaul University Asset-Based Community Development Institute, was one of the founders of the American Institute of Financial Gerontology, and previously was Director of Research at the MetLife Mature Market Institute. 

'''Multiple Columns, Multiple Topics'''

The orientation of the "gerontology column" in the Journal of Financial Service Professionals mirrors the basic mission of Financial Gerontology itself: to introduce, teach, illustrate, document, and explain the concepts, issues, data, and experiences of gerontology to professionals in the fields of finance and business. Since 1990, the range of topics and titles collectively reflects what could be seen as a full introductory university course in gerontology offered to the financial services professional (albeit without formal exams and credits). Some of the columns have been "data heavy," including: “The Older Population and Rising National Health Care Costs: A Case of the ‘Compositional Fallacy’?” (January 1993); “Pension Complexity, the Middle Class, and Financial Professionals: New Evidence from the 2001 Survey of Consumer Finances" (November 2003); “Generational Demographics, Gerontology, and Finance: Size Matters, but the Story is More Complex” (July 2009); “How Everybody’s Consumer Opinions Interact with the Gross Domestic Product: A Brief Look at the Index of Consumer Sentiment” (July 2013); “The Twenty-first Century ‘Dependency Ratio’—Older People vs. Older Workers” (November 2013); “The Democratization of Financial Gerontology" (March 2014).

One of the foundational concepts of Financial Gerontology is that gerontology is not the study of "old people" but is the study of the multiple processes of aging. A corollary (and conundrum) of this concept is that age differences among individuals and groups of people may not be the result of aging. An alternative explanation, a "rival hypothesis" to maturational-developmental aging, is the ''generational explanation''. In many areas of human attitudes and behavior--financial, social, political, personal--the differences between younger and older people may be caused not by their aging but by their generation, their [[Cohort effect|birth cohort]], their personal exposure to a slice of history when they were growing up. Given the direct relevance to financial practitioners of untangling the maturation (aging) vs. generation (cohort) interpretations of financial behavior, a number of Financial Gerontology columns over the years focused on this generational cluster of issues, including: “Communicating With Worried Older Clients: The Impact of ‘Generational Diversity’ ” (May 1992); “Too Much Money for Retirement: Are There Generational Differences?” (November 2005); “Financial Planning for the ‘Senior Sandwich’ Generation,” (March 2006); “Current Trends in Pension Participation: The Impact of Age, Cohort, and Enrollment Practices” (July 2006); “Prospective Age vs. Chronological Age: Why 60 Really is the New 40” (March 2010).

Other columns focus more directly on the family and care-giving issues that financial professionals encounter when dealing with "older" men and women (including middle-aged persons); for example: “Personal Care, Home Care, and Long-Term Care Insurance" (November 1991); “Caring For Elderly Parents: Where Do You Look For Help? [Why Does a Financial Planner Need to Know About Geriatric Care?]” (July 1994); “The Financial Services Advisor as a Geriatric Medical Consultant" (July 2002); “Live Long and Prosper: The Challenges of Longevity Planning" (November 2008); "Life Planning and Retirement Planning: Where Do They Intersect?" (January 2016); "Planning for the Utterly Unexpected: Advice for the Financial Planner" (November 2017).

Not surprisingly, the main focus of Financial Gerontology columns is on connections among aging and money. Even as the services being sold are primarily financial, in dealing with aging men and women alongside their middle-aging family, the financial professional is often asked for non-financial advice. Questions about long-term care, senior housing, estate and longevity planning often requires expertise beyond just financial choices and specifics. Sometimes the questions are quasi-emergencies, about a parent's possible memory issues, driving, where and when to move out of a large house. The experience of many financial professionals is that understanding such non-financial issues, having a supply of information and referral, helps to build a relationship of empathy, trust, and expertise. Several of the columns illustrate how the financial professional can at times act as a kind of geriatric consultant to their clients, including: “Alzheimer's Disease as 'Normal Aging'-- Retirement Planning and the New Longevity” (November 1993); Caring For Elderly Parents: Where Do You Look For Help? [Why Does a Financial Planner Need to Know About Geriatric Care?]” (July 1994); “Geriatric Assisted Living: When Mom and Dad Can’t Live Alone Anymore” (March 1996); “The Financial Services Advisor as a Geriatric Medical Consultant" (July 2002); “The Financial Professional’s Role in Comprehensive Geriatric Assessment” (March 2005).

And where every Financial Gerontology column embodies a serious educational purpose, several have had a more whimsical flavor, including: “Sex, Asset Accumulation, and Rock’n’Roll: Introducing Retirement Planning to Teenagers and Other Pre-Middle-Agers" (November 1992); “Hair Spray and Life Insurance: Capitalizing on the Baby Boom's Diversity" (May 1993); “Successful Aging, Willard Scott, and Dental Floss" (March 2002); “Nanatechnology: The Financial Gerontologist as Technology Consultant” (July 2008); “Nostalgia as a Financial Variable” (March 2011); "Tombstones" (July 2015); "Millennials and Finance: The Amazon Generation" (November 2015).

===The American Institute of Financial Gerontology===
The idea for a formal educational program in Financial Gerontology emerged starting around 1999 from the experience of two gerontology researchers-teachers, Dr. Neal Cutler and Dr. John Migliaccio. At the time Cutler was a professor of gerontology and Migliaccio was president of a gerontology marketing and consulting firm. The work of each focused on a financial view of gerontology and a gerontological view of finance. Over the years they had been invited to give presentations (sometimes together, sometimes individually) on gerontology to meetings and organizations of financial professionals. The increasing number of these invited presentations suggested to them the need within the financial services profession for a more structured and recurring educational program. As noted in the discussion of the Boettner Institute, the basic model was not to teach finance but to introduce, explain, illustrate, the value of gerontology to professionals already providing financial services to clients. This general educational goal was strengthened by the fact that the clientele of an increasing number of financial professionals included not only younger clients who were now elders, but also the middle-aged families of those now-elder clients.

Working with a small number of colleagues in both the financial services industry and academic gerontology, they drafted a curriculum of core courses and electives, examined alternative educational formats, identified potential faculty, and evaluated the likely success of a new educational program in a financial industry already populated with dozens of courses, certificates, and continuing education alternatives. The view of each of these elements was judged to be positive, and the American Institute of Financial Gerontology (AIFG) was incorporated in 2002. The educational structure of AIFG follows the general model of professional education. It offers a range of specialized courses, including both required and elective courses followed by a monitored written examination, culminating in a named designation. AIFG chose a "traditional" educational model of in-person courses and examinations; the explosion of online education was just beginning. Each course was a four-hour lecture-discussion seminar. Completion of the program included four required Core courses and two Electives (described below) selected from an expanding list of elective topics and courses. Like the traditional courses, the comprehensive final examination was also done in-person in a monitored context. AIFG's designation was conferred upon successful completion of the six courses and exam. Given the number of certifications in the finance industry, the initial name of the designation was "Certified Financial Gerontologist" (CFG). In addition to other reasons for this name, the rationale was also that financial professionals would see the parallel between the CFG and the well-established [[Certified Financial Planner|Certified Financial Planner (CFG)]] designation. Financial Gerontology would be seen as an additional specialization that some professionals would add to their education and training. As it turned out, however, the parallelism of CFG and CFP was perceived by some as more confusing that helpful. Consequently, after two years of courses and awarded designations, as the newer and smaller program AIFG changed its designation to the Registered Financial Gerontologist (RFG).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uzelac|first=Ellen|date=February 2006|title=Wisdom for the Ages|url=|journal=Research|volume=Volume 29, Number 2|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Congemi|first=Frank|date=September 2008|title=Plan Your Future with Financial Gerontology|url=http://www.mdmag.com/journals/pmd/2006/110/4776|journal=MD Magazine|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Students and Prerequisites====
The RFG vs. CFP relationship is important to the AIFG story in another fundamental way: identifying students eligible to enroll in the program. A basic premise of Financial Gerontology education is that it teaches gerontology to financial professionals. Thus, from its earliest conception AIFG required a demonstrable financial educational background as the prerequisite to enrollment in the RFG program. During the first five years of the program, most RFG students were those who had previously earned the CFP -- or similar financial planning certifications (e.g., the ChFC, Chartered Financial Consultant). In this structured way the AIFG curriculum was not intended to compete with other basic financial educational programs, but to be an extended, specialized educational experience. Some of the AIFG students described it as a "boutique" kind of focused education. In recent years, as the program grew nationally, about a third of AIFG students came from other finance-related occupations, including lawyers, accountants, stock brokers, retirement advisers, social services administrators, and even some financial journalists. While not required, virtually all AIFG students had a college degree although not necessarily in finance, economics, or business. Rather, the key enrollment prerequisite was professional practitioner experience in financial services.

====AIFG Core Courses and Electives====
'''Core Courses.''' AIFG courses, both Core and Electives, are "traditional" in-class face-to-face seminar classes (typically 20-25 students). Each course is scheduled as a four-hour class. Each student takes the four Core courses plus two Electives. To minimize the amount of travel and time that full-time financial professionals would spend out of office, the curriculum was offered and organized into a mid-to-late-week schedule: two four-hour Core courses on a Wednesday, the second two Core courses on Thursday, two Electives (selected from four available at any given session) on Friday, and the comprehensive examination on Saturday morning.

{{indent|5}}'''AIFG 101.''' The introductory course, "The New Science of Wealth Span Planning", introduces the Wealth Span model of individual-level financial planning, with a focus on the four "kinds" or four "lenses" of aging described earlier: population aging, individual aging, family aging, and generational aging. In introducing the Wealth Span model, the course focuses on the historical changes from the 19th to the 21st Century in the balance between and the changes within the Accumulation Stage and Expenditure Stage of the Wealth Span. AIFG 101 also introduces the student to different ways of understanding national (and international) population dynamics that demonstrate the gerontological demographics influencing individuals, families, social policies, and their combined impact on financial issues. For example, [[Population pyramid|population pyramids]] are used to illustrate changes, 1950 to 2050, in the fundamental age structure of the United States, the contours of which illustrate the "morphing" of a triangular profile into an oval population profile.

{{indent|5}}'''AIFG 102.''' The second Core course, "Basic Processes of Aging: Physical, Psychological, and Social", builds on the core concept that gerontology is not the study of "old people" but embodies a central focus on the '''multiple''' processes of aging. Students see the progression of aging and maturation from the perspectives of biology, psychology, and sociology. The course examines also how the maturational stages of the life course affect overall life planning which in turn directly influence how individual and family financial decisions are made in the crucial areas of employment and retirement. In keeping with the multidisciplinary nature of gerontology in general, this course is regularly taught by a professor of sociology who directs a university gerontology program and who is also a faculty member in a medical school.

{{indent|5}}'''AIFG 103.''' The third Core course, "Serving the Older Client: Values, Ethics, and Lifespan Development" , moves into the realm of ethics and legal aspects of client-oriented financial practice. Part of the course elaborates the procedural nuts and bolts of serving and protecting the interests of older persons, e.g., guardianships, conservatorships, powers of attorney, trusts. More critically, the course focuses on the ethical (which can become legal) challenges in the context of older clients, e.g., client decisional capacity and surrogate decision-making. In many cases the key question becomes "who is the client?" For example, when the son (and heir) brings his 80-year-old father to the son's financial planner in order to "review" the father's pattern of investing and spending, who really is the professional's client? In this way the course introduces some of the ideas offered in the Family Aging Elective (AIFG 105). The course was initially developed by a professor of ethics and philosophy and later taught by attorneys one of whom is a past president of the National Academy of Elder Law Attorneys.

{{indent|5}}'''AIFG 104.''' The fourth Core course, "Financing Longevity" , returns to the linkages between gerontology and finance. While much financial practice focuses on how individuals establish and accumulate their financial resources, a primary interest of most older clients is protecting and spending their wealth with an eye to their own and their family's future needs. In the 21st Century, further, financial practice is taking place as men and women are spending more time in their older years. Part of the course introduces the basics of pensions, Social Security, and Medicare as key elements of financial resources in older age; in this way, the course also introduces the AIFG Long-term Care (AIFG 107) and Medicare (AIFG 110) electives. A critical component of the course, however, is taking a dynamic look at how different forms of investment, risk, and expenditures change over the life course, over the wealth span. How should Tom and Mary's financial plan at age 55 be different from their plan at age 35 (and when their children are toddlers vs. their now 30-year-old "kids")? This course has been taught only by faculty who have (at least) the Certified Financial Planner (CFP) designation.

'''Electives.''' In addition to these four Core courses each student is required to complete two Electives (also offered as four-hour in-person seminar style classes). Over the years, six Electives were rotated through the curriculum.

{{indent|5}}'''AIFG 105.''' '''Family Aging'''. The central premise of the "families and money" Elective, "Families and Aging: Resources for Professionals" is that "financial decisions are family decisions." As the population ages so do individual members of the family. As with other elements of gerontology, this implies that it is not just the parents (and grandparents) who are older than was the case in prior decades.  In the context of Family Aging the care-providing children are also older than was the case decades ago. These family aging dynamics have produced an extension of the concept of the "sandwich" generation into the more contemporary reality of the "senior sandwich" generation in which the "60-year-old kids" are the generation in the middle, taking care of (financially and personally) their 90-year-old parents (while also providing financial assistance to their own adult children. AIFG 105 is offered at every AIFG session; it has become "almost" a Core course in that the vast majority of students elect to take it.

{{indent|5}}'''AIFG 106.''' '''Aging Network.''' The "Aging Network and the Long-Term Care Service Delivery System" Elective focuses on two care-provider aging-oriented networks within which professionals should work in providing financial counseling and services to their clients. The "formal" network of over local 600 Area Agencies on Aging (AAA) are part of the local-state-federal network created since the 1970s by the [[Older Americans Act]] of 1965 (OAA). Much of the work of the AAAs is aimed at identifying services and local agencies that will increase the capacity to elderly and frail persons to age in place in their own home, rather than moving into nursing homes -- which clearly has financial as well as social consequences for elders and their family. Since relatively few financial professionals are aware of this aging network and the various social, nutrition, and health services the local AAAs provide, AIFG 105 was developed to provide the connection. In addition to this formal network, AIFG also introduces the larger network of organizations, agencies, and programs with which the financial professional can partner to offer clients a variety of assistance.  This Elective is offered in about half of AIFG sessions.

{{indent|5}}'''AIFG 107. Long-term Care Solutions.'''  Long-term care institutions and services, with an emphasis on the complexity of financing and especially long-term care insurance, has been a high priority concern of financial planners and their clients. "Long-term Care Solutions" offers a comprehensive overview of the subject. While a substantial part of long-term care financing is seen in individually-purchased long-term care insurance, a substantial proportion of older Americans believe they will pay for their long-term care, either services or nursing home residence, from Medicare. While Medicare's primary function is health insurance, under some circumstances it does pay for some long-term services. Further, Medicaid does pay for nursing home services under some circumstances. Both of these "under some circumstances" make the financial planning for long-term complex, for both client and the adviser, including the "complexity" of misunderstanding of "Medicare" vs. "Medicaid" vs. "medigap" by both professionals and the public. AIFG 107 is a very popular Elective and is offered at almost every AIFG session.

{{indent|5}}'''AIFG 108. Financial Preparedness.''' The overarching theme of the  "Financial Preparedness for Later Life" Elective is that while most financial planners have substantial knowledge of and experience with strategies for investment and wealth accumulation (especially in dealing with relatively younger clients), traditional understanding of the tools and techniques of later-life spending, risk, and family dynamics. Dealing with the already-made "fixed" results of previously-made choices concerning pensions, investments, and Social Security is only a first step. In discussing individual and family strategies for expanding wealth in later life as well as protecting the already accumulated assets, AIFG 108 examines such approaches as portfolio theory and probability theory, including techniques for managing several kinds of financial risk in the context of multiple and tiered time horizons especially relevant to older persons and their families, alongside the effects of inflation and taxes. 

{{indent|5}}'''AIFG 109. Marketing.''' "Successful Marketing to the 50+ Population" is designed to serve the majority of AIFG students who are sole proprietors or partners in small businesses and thus are responsible for their own local marketing strategies. The course reviews marketing approaches of special relevance to older persons, including consumer values analysis, strategies for mature consumer segmentation, and current psychographic frameworks. Seen through the "lens" of Generational Aging, the course places special emphasis on the consumer characteristics of the major generational cohorts that define the 50+ age population, including Baby Boomers, "In-Betweeners," and Seniors. Further, looking through the "lens" of Family Aging, the course examines such strategies as "tangential marketing" through which, for example, marketing is aimed at middle-age-children purchasers for products to be "consumed" by their elder parents. This Elective is offered at almost every AIFG session. 

{{indent|5}}'''AIFG 110. Medicare.''' One of the key links among aging, money, and retirement is concern with how to pay for health care. AIFG courses speak to this central Financial Gerontology issue in several ways, including:  trends in Population Aging and Individual Aging (AIFG 101), physical and psychological aspects of aging (AIFG 102), allocation of resources across the life course (AIFG 104), middle-aged children's responsibilities for elder parents (AIFG 105), and the financing of long-term care (AIFG 107). Substantial Medicare changes were enacted in 2003 in the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act|Medicare Modernization Act]], especially its central policy and financial innovation, the [[Medicare Part D|Part D prescription drug benefit]] to subsidize the costs of prescription drugs and prescription drug insurance premiums for Medicare beneficiaries. In response to requests and advice from both prior and potential students, in collaboration with a health care attorney specializing in public programs, in 2006 AIFG created and offered AIFG 110, "Gerontology and the New Medicare." The course includes a detailed history of Medicare, including distinctions between Medicare and [[Medicaid]]; a review and analysis of Medicare Supplemental Insurance plans (usually referred to as "[[medigap]]" insurance) including standardization of plans, State variations, and the role of [[Managed care|Managed Care]]; and, centrally, the processes, scope and limitations, and cost of the new Medicare Part D pharmaceutical benefits. This Elective is offered at every AIFG session.

====Faculty Profiles====
Reflecting the field of Financial Gerontology itself, the AIFG faculty is highly multidisciplinary, including a range of both academic and professional disciplines. Over the years, twenty-two faculty have taught the AIFG courses described above. The faculty includes elder law attorneys, social workers, financial planners, accountants, insurance specialists, social service administrators, and university faculty. The AIFG faculty exhibits a fairly broad range of degrees and designations, including:  PhD (7), CFP [plus ChFC, etc.] (5); JD (3), MBA (3), MSW (2), MHealth (2), CPA (1). Three of the four Core courses are taught exclusively by PhDs: New Science of Wealth Span Planning, Basic Processes of Aging, and Family Aging. The Ethics and Values course was developed and taught by a professor of ethics and currently taught only by elder law attorneys. The Marketing course has been taught by two faculty each of whom owns their own small aging-focused marketing firms. The Financing Longevity and Financial Preparedness courses were taught by finance specialists with MBA and CFP backgrounds. The Long-term Care Finance and Medicare courses are taught only by faculty with finance, law, or accounting backgrounds.

===International Financial Gerontology===
====Korean Institute of Financial Gerontology====

Of the hundreds of students who completed the AIFG's Registered Financial Gerontologist (RFG) program, one was a Korean banker and entrepreneur studying for his Master of Science degree in Gerontology at the University of North Carolina, Greensboro (UNCG). Dr. Joo Han, a successful Mergers and Acquisitions banker in South Korea who earlier earned his PhD in Accounting from City University of New York, was developing a second career focused on providing housing and social services to elders in Korea. During his MS-Gerontology studies he also enrolled in the AIFG program in 2008 which was offering the RFG curriculum at UNCG. Dr. Han saw the linking social and financial services education as similarly valuable for financial advisers in Korea, using the AIFG program as a model. Despite the obvious cultural and language differences between Korea and the U.S., alongside the somewhat-similar but different demographic and retirement profiles of the two countries, Han resolved to bring Financial Gerontology education and training to Korea. A partnership with AIFG was developed, and in June 2011 the Korean Institute of Financial Gerontology began offering its RFG curriculum.

Both Korea and the United States are experiencing substantial Population Aging, with increasingly large numbers and percentages of their populations living in older age. Both countries have retirement security policies that include both public and private pensions. Beyond such basic similarities, however, are substantial differences that speak directly to the need for advisers and clients who understand the concepts and details of Financial Gerontology. In the realm of population, for example, Korea is aging at a faster pace than the U.S. and is expected to reach the status of "hyper-aged" (e.g., % of the population over age 65; large numbers of centenarians) in 2026 -- compared to the U.S. in 2036. In this sense, given the impact of gerontological demographics upon financial practice, the need for Financial Gerontology education in Korea is substantial. On the matter of health care in older age, for example, although Korean citizens have the advantage of [[Health in South Korea|universal health care]], the need for educated health-financial planning remains. In part this is due to recent patterns of health insurance. The National Health Insurance Act, enacted in 1977, initially focused on workers in large companies, later expanded to other employment sectors, reaching universal coverage by 1989. Further, health insurance itself was provided by hundreds of employment-sector based insurance societies, but merged into a single health care system by 2004.

The retirement income security policies in Korea are similar to the model of a three-legged stool or three-tier system that characterizes the U.S. and other countries. The first tier is the [[Pension policy in South Korea|Basic Livelihood Security Program]] for all Korean citizens in poverty, functionally (if roughly) similar to the [[Supplemental Security Income|U.S. Supplemental Security Income (SSI) program.]] It is based on current income (welfare) rather than on age or past employment. The first tier also includes the National Basic Livelihood Security program which provides income to retired older persons; this program is based on both age and current income. The second tier is the National Pension Scheme (NPS) created in 1986. The NPS is a government guaranteed employment-based [[Defined benefit pension plan|Defined Benefit]] pension plan, partially funded by the employee and employer who contribute equally (currently, 4.5% of gross income) to the plan. Coverage is fundamentally mandatory for persons employed in both private and public organizations. The third tier reflects individual investment and savings.

Embedded in this birds-eye view of the Korean income security system are several complexities that suggest the need for advisers trained in both finance and gerontology. Perhaps the largest area of complexity is the relative newness of pension policies and systems, especially considering the rapid economic development of the Korean economy in the past two decades alongside, as mentioned, the rapid aging of the Korean population. Created as a Defined Benefit pension system, the NPS includes official income replacement rates. The NPS soon recognized that due to rapid population and related factors, the fund was facing financial deficits. Consequently, first in 1998 and again in 2007, the replacement rates were lowered from 70% to 60% and then to 50%, with another reduction to 40% over the years 2009-2028. During these years, also as part of responding to an anticipated deficit, the full-benefits retirement age was raised from 60 to 65. Both confusion about benefits and distrust in the national pension system increased. An additional complication is that Korean pension benefits are often paid as lump sum annuities, placing even more responsibility on the retiree for balancing financial issues with older-age planning.

The sum of these and similar dynamics influenced Dr. Joo Han to partner with AIFG to establish the Korean Institute of Financial Gerontology (KIFG). The KIFG approach focuses on working with specific financial institutions -- primarily banks, investment firms, and insurance companies -- to provide education and training to their employees, compared to the AIFG focus on individual professionals as students in educational sessions held at academic and gerontology venues throughout the country. During its first years KIFG graduated about 100 students per year.

KIFG offers a five-day curriculum of required courses, reflecting 40 hours of coursework. Each day represents a Financial Gerontology theme. Day 1 is an introduction to Financial Gerontology, including an overview of the aging society, examination of Baby Boomer policies in Korea, and an examination of the [[University of the Third Age|multinational]] "Third Age" concept -- roughly the time between retirement and disability when the older individual can focus on life fulfilling activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Gerontology in the Era of the Third Age: Implications and Next Steps|last=Karr, D.  and Komp, K.|first=|publisher=Springer|year=2011|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Day 2 focuses on housing issues, including universal design and the development of age-friendly cities, older-age housing, long-term care services, and the role of nonprofit organizations in the housing arena. Included here also is the new "well-dying" law in Korea that recognizes the rights of terminally ill people to choose their own death and die with dignity. Day 3 is an experiential day in which the students, mostly financial professionals working in banks and insurance companies, visit senior centers, nursing homes, and other older age facilities. Day 4 focuses on the practicalities linking longevity and financial planning, including elder law, health care, and marketing to the 50+ population. Day 5 introduces concepts and issues of communicating with seniors, counselling psychology with seniors, and what is included in a "senior-friendly" business.

====Financial Gerontology in China====

Following two years of discussion and negotiation, in 2017 a partnership was established between AIFG and a financial services company in the People's Republic of China to establish a Financial Gerontology program in China. Shanghai Jian Rui Investment &amp; Management Ltd. (JR), based in Shanghai, is involved in investment and pension management. As in other developing countries, significant changes in public social security programs and private pension arrangements,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pensionfundsonline.co.uk/content/country-profiles/china/105|title=Country Profiles: China|last=Pension Funds Online|first=|date=2017|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside rapid Population Aging and Individual Aging, have created an emerging need for advisers and managers with knowledge and understanding of the dynamics of Financial Gerontology in [[Economy of China|China]]. To further these educational goals, JR has in turn partnered with the [[Chinese Academy of Social Sciences]] (CASS), described as the premier and the most comprehensive academic research organization in China for study in the fields of philosophy and social sciences. As initially conceived, the program in China will adapt and build upon the AIFG curriculum of four Core courses and selected Elective courses. The intent of the program is to offer the Registered Financial Gerontologist professional designation to qualified Chinese students. At the same time, individual courses and sets of courses will be made available to students not seeking to achieve a formal certification. Through a set of working groups involving JR, CASS, and AIFG, substantial adaptation is being made to reflect the current financial, demographic, and policy contours of the Chinese aging society. The inaugural Chinese Financial Gerontology courses are scheduled to be offered in the first quarter of 2018.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8435">'''Günter Ropohl''' (14 June 1939 in [[Cologne]], Germany – 28 January 2017) was a German philosopher of technology.

== Biography ==
Günter Ropohl studied [[mechanical engineering]] and philosophy at [[Stuttgart]] University, where he was a scholar of the philosopher [[Max Bense]]. After his PhD ([[Dr.-Ing.]]) in 1970, he wrote his [[Habilitation]] thesis in Philosophy und Sociology at [[Karlsruhe University]] 1978 under the supervision of [[Hans Lenk (philosopher)|Hans Lenk]]. His work dealt with the [[systems theory]] of "[[Technik]]" (engl. ''technique''), leading to the concept of [[general technology]].&lt;ref&gt;published under the title ''Eine Systemtheorie der Technik'' 1979, 2nd. ed. under the title ''Allgemeine Technologie'', 1999, 3rd ed. 2009, open source: [http://digbib.ubka.uni-karlsruhe.de/volltexte/1000011529]&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 1979, Ropohl became Professor at the [[Universität Karlsruhe (TH)]]. Soon after, in 1981, he became Professor for [[Allgemeine Technologie]] (general technology) and [[philosophy of technology]] at the [[Johann Wolfgang Goethe-Universität]] in [[Frankfurt am Main]], Germany (until 2004). In the 1980s, he visited his colleague and friend [[Carl Mitcham]] in the United States. From 1983 to 1991, i.e. during the period of the [[Cold War]], he was course director and visiting lecturer at the Inter-University Centre Dubrovnik ([[Croatia]]). In 1988, he was invited as visiting professor at the [[Rochester Institute of Technology]], Rochester NY.
Ropohl was an honorary member of the German Engineering Association ([[Verein Deutscher Ingenieure|VDI]]), due to his interdisciplinary engagement for the philosophy of technology. He was co-editor of an anthology of the ''classics'' in the philosophy of technology in a Continental-European tradition.&lt;ref&gt;* Hubig, Ch., Huning, A. and Ropohl, G. (Eds.), ''Nachdenken über Technik. Die Klassiker der Technikphilosophie'', Berlin 2000. 3rd ed. 2013 (to be translated into English and Chinese in the next years).&lt;/ref&gt; Ropohl published 15 monographs, (co-)edited another 15 books and published more than 180 articles. He died on 28 January 2017 at the age of 77.&lt;ref&gt;[http://netzwerk-rauchen.de/component/content/article/1-aktuelle-nachrichten/975-guenter-ropohl-verstorben.html Günter Ropohl verstorben] {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==

A central concept in his work was [[sociotechnical systems]], i.e. he regarded techniques as societal structures. Ropohl was a critic of the systems theory of [[Niklas Luhmann]] and voted for the recognition of [[material culture]]. His definition of (''German'') "Technik" included a) the [[utility]], b) artificiality and c) [[Function (engineering)|functionality]]. In the focus of his work is the combination of technique as [[Document|artefact]] and [[Action theory (philosophy)|action]], whereas [[knowledge]] insinuates the meta-concept of [[technology]]. Therefore, he differentiated between [[engineering sciences]] and [[technical sciences]].&lt;ref&gt;Günter Ropohl, ''Eine Systemtheorie der Technik'', 1979, p. 34f.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ropohl was well known in the German-speaking academia for his writings on the concepts of ''Technik'' and ''Technologie'', the [[ethics of technology]], [[technology assessment]], professional ethics for engineers and on the societal need for educating towards technology literacy.

He received a [[Festschrift]] with contributions from academic scholars, focusing on his work and related discourses, both on his 65th and 75th birthday (edited by [[Nicole C. Karafyllis]], see literature), including a complete list of his publications from the late 1960s to 2014.

'''Immunoproteomics''' is the study of large sets of [[protein]]s ([[proteomics]]) involved in the [[Immune system|immune response]].

Examples of common applications of immunoproteomics include:
* The isolation and mass spectrometric identification of [[Major histocompatibility complex|MHC (major histocompatibility complex)]] binding peptides
* Purification and identification of protein [[antigen]]s binding specific [[Antibody|antibodies]] (or other affinity reagents)
* Comparative immunoproteomics to identify proteins and pathways modulated by a specific infectious organism, disease or toxin.

The identification of proteins in immunoproteomics is carried out by techniques including gel based, microarray based, and DNA based techniques, with mass spectroscopy typically being the ultimate identification method.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fulton|first=Kelly M.|last2=Twine|first2=Susan M.|date=2013-01-01|title=Immunoproteomics: current technology and applications|journal=Methods in Molecular Biology |volume=1061|pages=21–57|doi=10.1007/978-1-62703-589-7_2|issn=1940-6029|pmid=23963929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Applications ==

=== Immunology ===
Immunoproteomics is and has been used to increase scientific understanding of both [[autoimmune disease]] pathology and progression. Using biochemical techniques, [[gene]] and ultimately protein expression can be measured with high fidelity. With this information, the biochemical pathways causing pathology in conditions such as [[multiple sclerosis]] and [[Crohn's disease]] can potentially be elucidated. Serum antibody identification in particular has proven to be very useful as a diagnostic tool for a number of diseases in modern medicine, in large part due to the relatively high stability of serum antibodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tjalsma|first=Harold|last2=Schaeps|first2=Renée M. J.|last3=Swinkels|first3=Dorine W.|date=2008-02-01|title=Immunoproteomics: From biomarker discovery to diagnostic applications|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/prca.200780012/abstract|journal=Proteomics: Clinical Applications|language=en|volume=2|issue=2|pages=167–180|doi=10.1002/prca.200780012|issn=1862-8354}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Immunoproteomic techniques are additionally used for the isolation of antibodies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hess|first=Jennifer L.|last2=Blazer|first2=Levi|last3=Romer|first3=Terence|last4=Faber|first4=Lee|last5=Buller|first5=R. Mark|last6=Boyle|first6=Michael D.

Identification and engineering of antibodies involved in autoimmune disease pathology may offer novel techniques in disease therapy.

===Drug engineering===
By identifying the antigens responsible for a particular immune response, it is possible to identify viable targets for novel drugs.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Falisse-Poirrier|first1=Nandini|last2=Ruelle|first2=Virginie|last3=ElMoualij|first3=Benaissa|last4=Zorzi|first4=Danièle|last5=Pierard|first5=Olivier|last6=Heinen|first6=Ernst|last7=De Pauw|first7=Edwin|last8=Zorzi|first8=Willy|title=Advances in immunoproteomics for serological characterization of microbial antigens|journal=Journal of Microbiological Methods|date=1 December 2006|volume=67|issue=3|pages=593–596|doi=10.1016/j.mimet.2006.05.002|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0167701206001540}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, specific  antigens can further be classified based on immunoreactivity for identification of future potential [[vaccine]] preparations.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt; In addition to the identification of vaccine candidates, immunoproteomic techniques such as western blotting can additionally be used for measuring the efficacy of a given vaccine.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

== Technology and instrumentation ==

=== Mass spectrometry ===
[[Mass spectrometry]] can be used in the sequencing of MHC binding motifs, which can subsequently be used to predict [[T cell]] [[epitope]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Purcell|first=A. W.|last2=Gorman|first2=J. J.|date=2004-03-01|title=Immunoproteomics Mass Spectrometry-based Methods to Study the Targets of the Immune Response|url=http://www.mcponline.org/content/3/3/193|journal=Molecular &amp; Cellular Proteomics|language=en|volume=3|issue=3|pages=193–208|doi=10.1074/mcp.R300013-MCP200|issn=1535-9476|pmid=14718575}}&lt;/ref&gt; The technique of [[peptide mass fingerprinting]] (PMF) can be used to check a peptide's mass spectrum against a database of protein digests which have already been documented.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.proteinidentification.org/an-introduction-to-protein-identification/|title=An Introduction to Protein Identification - Protein Analysis|website=Protein Analysis|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the mass spectrum of the protein of interest as well as the database protein share a large amount of [[Homology (biology)|homology]], it is likely that the protein of interest is contained within the sample.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 2-D gel electrophoresis and western blotting ===
[[Two-dimensional gel electrophoresis]] (2-D gel) techniques in culmination with [[western blot]]ting has been used for many years in the identification of immune response magnitude.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This can be accomplished by comparing various samples against [[molecular-weight size marker]]s for qualitative analysis and  against known amounts of protein standards for quantitative analysis.[[File:2D-Gel Electrophoresis Apparatus.jpg|thumb|Common 2D-gel electrophoresis apparatus]]

=== 2-D liquid chromatography ===
By coupling [[Chromatography|liquid chromatography]] with a variety of other immunodetection techniques such as serological [[proteome]] analysis (SERPA), it is possible to analyze the [[hydrophobicity]], [[Isoelectric point|PI]], [[Mass|relative mass]], and antibody reactivity of antibodies within a given serum.&lt;ref name="sciencedirect.com"/&gt;

=== Microarray ===
[[DNA microarray|Microarray]] analysis of various serums can be used as a means to identify changes in gene expression before, after, and during a given immune response.

An '''institutional review board''' ('''IRB'''), also known as an '''independent ethics committee''' ('''IEC'''), '''ethical review board''' ('''ERB'''), or '''research ethics board''' ('''REB'''), is a type of [[committee]] that applies [[research#Research ethics|research ethics]] by reviewing the [[methodology|methods]] proposed for [[research]] to ensure that they are [[ethics|ethical]]. Such boards are formally designated to approve (or reject), monitor, and review [[biomedical]] and [[behavioral]] research involving [[human]]s. They often conduct some form of [[risk-benefit analysis]] in an attempt to determine whether or not research should be conducted.&lt;ref&gt;The Office of Human Research Protection. Institutional Review Board Guidebook. "Chapter 3, Section A: Risk/Benefit Analysis.” pp. 1-10 [http://www.saylor.org/site/wp-content/uploads/2011/08/PSYCH202A-3.1.4-Institutional-Review-Board.pdf] Retrieved May 30, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; The purpose of the IRB is to assure that appropriate steps are taken to protect the rights and [[quality of life|welfare]] of humans participating as subjects in a research study. Along with developed countries, many developing countries have established national, regional or local Institutional Review Boards in order to safeguard ethical conduct of research concerning both national and international norms, regulations or codes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mohamadi|first=Amin|last2=Asghari|first2=Fariba|last3=Rashidian|first3=Arash|date=2014|title=Continuing review of ethics in clinical trials: a surveillance study in Iran|journal=Journal of Medical Ethics and History of Medicine|volume=7|pages=22|pmc=4648212|pmid=26587202}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
A key goal of IRBs is to protect human subjects from physical or psychological harm, which they attempt to do by reviewing research protocols and related materials. The protocol review assesses the ethics of the research and its methods, promotes fully informed and voluntary participation by prospective subjects capable of making such choices (or, if that is not possible, informed permission given by a suitable proxy), and seeks to maximize the safety of subjects.

In the [[United States]], the [[U.S. Food and Drug Administration|Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) and [[United States Department of Health and Human Services|Department of Health and Human Services]] (specifically [[Office for Human Research Protections]]) regulations (see [[Human subject research legislation in the United States]]) have empowered IRBs to approve, require modifications in planned research prior to approval, or disapprove research. IRBs are responsible for critical oversight functions for research conducted on human subjects that are "scientific", "ethical", and "regulatory". The equivalent body responsible for overseeing U.S. federally funded research using animals is the [[Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee]] (IACUC).

IRBs are most commonly used for studies in the fields of [[health]] and the social sciences, including [[anthropology]], [[sociology]], and [[psychology]]. Such studies may be [[clinical trials]] of new drugs or devices, studies of personal or social behavior, opinions or attitudes, or studies of how health care is delivered and might be improved.

==United States mandate for IRBs==
{{see also|Human subject research legislation in the United States}}

Formal review procedures for institutional human subject studies were originally developed in direct response to research abuses in the 20th century. Among the most notorious of these abuses were the [[Nazi human experimentation|experiments of Nazi physicians]], which became a focus of the post-World War II [[Doctors' Trial]], the [[Tuskegee Syphilis Study]], a long-term project conducted between 1932 and 1972 by the [[U.S. Public Health Service]], and numerous [[human radiation experiments]] conducted during the [[Cold War]].  Other controversial U.S. projects undertaken during this era include the [[Milgram experiment|Milgram obedience experiment]], the [[Stanford prison experiment]], and [[Project MKULTRA]], a series of classified [[mind control]] studies organized by the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]].

The result of these abuses was the [[National Research Act|National Research Act of 1974]] and the development of the [[Belmont Report]], which outlined the primary ethical principles in human subjects review; these include "respect for persons", "beneficence", and "justice". An IRB may only approve research for which the risks to subjects are balanced by potential benefits to society, and for which the selection of subjects presents a fair or just distribution of risks and benefits to eligible participants. A ''[[bona fide]]'' process for obtaining [[informed consent]] from participants is also generally needed. However, this requirement may be waived in certain circumstances – for example, when the risk of harm to participants is clearly minimal.

In the United States, IRBs are governed by Title 45 Code of Federal Regulations Part 46.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html |title=Code of Federal Regulations |publisher=HHS.gov |date=2010-01-15 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  These regulations define the rules and responsibilities for institutional review, which is required for all research that receives support, directly or indirectly, from the United States federal government. IRBs are themselves regulated by the Office for Human Research Protections (OHRP) within the [[Department of Health and Human Services]] (HHS). Additional requirements apply to IRBs that oversee clinical trials of drugs involved in [[new drug application]]s, or to studies that are supported by the [[United States Department of Defense]].

In addition to registering its IRB with the OHRP, an institution is also required to obtain and maintain a ''Federalwide Assurance'' or FWA, before undertaking federally funded human research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/assurances/index.html|title=IRBs and Assurances|author=|date=22 December 2010|website=hhs.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is an agreement in which the institution commits to abiding by the regulations governing human research. A secondary supplement to the FWA is required when institutions are undertaking research supported by the U.S. Department of Defense.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.fhpr.osd.mil/Libraries/HRPP_Documents/HRPP_laws_regulations_policies.sflb.ashx Human Research Protection Program (HRPP).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916055955/http://home.fhpr.osd.mil/Libraries/HRPP_Documents/HRPP_laws_regulations_policies.sflb.ashx |date=2014-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This ''DoD Addendum'' includes further compliance requirements for studies using military personnel, or when the human research involves populations in conflict zones, foreign prisoners, etc.&lt;ref&gt;[http://home.fhpr.osd.mil/Libraries/HRPP_Documents/P_R_DoD_Addendum_to_DHHS_FWA_20110107_1.sflb.ashx HRPP Information Sheet for DoD Addendum.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140916055816/http://home.fhpr.osd.mil/Libraries/HRPP_Documents/P_R_DoD_Addendum_to_DHHS_FWA_20110107_1.sflb.ashx |date=2014-09-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exceptions===
U.S. regulations identify several research categories that are considered exempt from IRB oversight. These categories include: 
*Research in conventional educational settings, such as those involving the study of instructional strategies or effectiveness of various techniques, curricula, or classroom management methods. In the case of studies involving the use of educational tests, there are specific provisions in the exemption to ensure that subjects cannot be identified or exposed to risks or liabilities.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.101"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html |title=Code of Federal Regulations |chapter=Part 46, Protection of Human Subjects |page=US 45 CFR 46.101 |author=Office for Human Research Protections |authorlink=Office for Human Research Protections |work=hhs.gov |date=January 15, 2009 |accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Research involving the analysis of existing data and other materials if they are already publicly available, or where the data can be collected such that individual subjects cannot be identified in any way.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.101" /&gt;
*Studies intended to assess the performance or effectiveness of public benefit or service programs, or to evaluate food taste, quality, or consumer acceptance.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.101" /&gt;

Generally, human research ethics guidelines require that decisions about exemption are made by an IRB representative, not by the investigators themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Ritter, F. et al, ''Running Behavioral Studies with Human Participants'', Sage Publications Inc. 2013., {{ISBN|9781452217420}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==International ethics review committees==
Numerous other countries have equivalent regulations or guidelines governing human subject studies and the [[ethics committee]]s that oversee them. However, the organizational responsibilities and the scope of the oversight purview can differ substantially from one nation to another, especially in the domain of non-medical research. The [[United States]] [[Department of Health and Human Services]] maintains a comprehensive compilation of regulations and guidelines in other countries, as well as related standards from a number of international and regional organizations.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/international/index.html International Compilation of Human Research Protections], Office for Human Research Protections, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services&lt;/ref&gt;

== Naming and composition ==
Although "IRB" is a generic term used in the United States by the FDA and HHS, each institution that establishes such a board may use whatever name it chooses. Many simply capitalize the term "Institutional Review Board" as the [[proper noun|proper name]] of their instance. Regardless of the name chosen, the IRB is subject to the FDA's IRB regulations when studies of FDA-regulated products are reviewed and approved. At one time such a committee was named the "Committee for the Protection of Human Subjects". Originally, IRBs were simply committees at academic institutions and medical facilities to monitor research studies involving human participants, primarily to minimize or avoid [[ethics|ethical]] problems. Today, some of these reviews are conducted by for-profit organizations known as 'independent' or 'commercial' IRBs. The responsibilities of these IRBs are identical to those based at academic or medical institutions, and they are governed by the same U.S. federal regulations.

The regulations set out the board's membership and composition requirements, with provisions for diversity in experience, expertise, and institutional affiliation. For example, the minimum number of members is five, at least one scientist, and at least one non-scientist. The guidance strongly suggests that the IRB contain both men and women, but there is no regulatory requirement for gender balance in the IRB's membership.  The full requirements are set out in 21 CFR 56.107.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=PART 56 - INSTITUTIONAL REVIEW BOARDS | url=http://cfr.vlex.com/vid/56-107-irb-membership-19703309 | publisher=[[Food and Drug Administration (United States)]] | date=28 June 1991 | accessdate=2009-05-12 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110813094327/http://cfr.vlex.com/vid/56-107-irb-membership-19703309 | archivedate=13 August 2011 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Convened and expedited reviews==
Unless a research proposal is determined to be exempt (see below), the IRB undertakes its work either in a convened meeting (a "full" review) or by using an expedited review procedure.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.108"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html |title=Code of Federal Regulations |chapter=Part 46, Protection of Human Subjects |page=US 45 CFR 46.108 |author=Office for Human Research Protections |authorlink=Office for Human Research Protections |work=hhs.gov |date=January 15, 2009 |accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a full review is required, a majority of the IRB members must be present at the meeting, at least one of whom has primary concern for the nonscientific aspects of the research.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.108"/&gt; The research can be approved if a majority of those present are in favor.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.108"/&gt;

An expedited review may be carried out if the research involves no more than minimal risk to subjects, or where minor changes are being made to previously approved research.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.110"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.hhs.gov/ohrp/humansubjects/guidance/45cfr46.html |title=Code of Federal Regulations |chapter=Part 46, Protection of Human Subjects |page=US 45 CFR 46.110 |author=Office for Human Research Protections |authorlink=Office for Human Research Protections |work=hhs.gov |date=January 15, 2009 |accessdate=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The regulations provide a list of research categories that may be reviewed in this manner.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.110"/&gt; An expedited review is carried out by the IRB chair, or by their designee(s) from the board membership. Research activity cannot be disapproved by expedited review.&lt;ref name="US 45 CFR 46.110"/&gt;

==Pharmaceutical trials and good clinical practice==
The [[International Conference on Harmonisation of Technical Requirements for Registration of Pharmaceuticals for Human Use|International Conference on Harmonisation]] sets out guidelines for registration of pharmaceuticals in multiple countries. It defines [[Good Clinical Practice]] (GCP), which is an agreed quality standard that governments can transpose into regulations for [[clinical trials]] involving human subjects.&lt;ref name=ICH-GCP&gt;{{cite web|last=International Conference on Harmonisation of technical requirements for registration of pharmaceuticals for human use|title=Good Clinical Practice|url=http://ichgcp.net/|accessdate=27 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Here is a summary of several key regulatory guidelines for oversight of clinical trials:

*Safeguard the rights, safety, and well-being of all trial subjects. Special attention should be paid to trials that may include vulnerable subjects, such as pregnant women, children, prisoners, the elderly, or persons with diminished comprehension.
*Obtain trial protocol(s)/amendment(s), written [[Informed consent|Informed Consent Form(s)]] (ICFs) and consent form updates the investigator proposes for use in the trial, subject recruitment procedures (e.g., advertisements), written information to be provided to subjects, investigator's brochure, available safety information, information about payments and compensation available to subjects, the investigator's current ''[[curriculum vitae]]'' and/or other documentation evidencing qualifications, and any other documents the IRB may need to fulfill its responsibilities.
*Review both the amount and method of payment to subjects to assure neither presents problems of coercion or undue influence on the trial subjects. Payments to a subject should be prorated and not wholly contingent on completion of the trial by the subject. Information regarding payment to subjects, including the methods, amounts, and schedule of payment to trial subjects, should be set forth in the written informed consent form and any other written information to be provided to subjects. The way payment will be prorated should be specified.
*Ensure that the proposed trial is reviewed within a reasonable time and document opinions and decisions in writing, clearly identifying the trial, the documents reviewed and recorded dates for approvals, required modifications prior to approval, disapproval of a proposed trial, or termination/suspension of any prior approval. Continuing review of ongoing trials is required at intervals appropriate to the degree of risk to human subjects, but at least once per year.

The reviewers may also request that more information be given to subjects when, in their judgment, the additional information would add meaningfully to the protection of the rights, safety and/or well-being of the subjects. When a non-therapeutic trial is to be carried out with the consent of the subject's legally acceptable representative, reviewers should determine that the proposed protocol and/or other document(s) adequately address relevant ethical concerns and meets applicable regulatory requirements for such trials. Where the protocol indicates prior consent of the trial subject or the subject's legally acceptable representative is not possible, the review should determine that the proposed protocol and/or other document(s) adequately addresses relevant ethical concerns and meets applicable regulatory requirements for such trials (i.e., in emergency situations).

== Adapting IRB review to social science ==
While the Belmont principles and U.S. federal regulations were formulated with biomedical and social-behavioral research in mind, the enforcement of the regulations, the examples used in typical presentations regarding the history of the regulatory requirements, and the extensiveness of written guidance have been predominantly focused on biomedical research.

Numerous complaints by investigators about the fit between the federal regulations and its IRB review requirements as they relate to social science research have been received.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunsalus|first=C.K.|last2=Bruner|first2=Edward M.|last3=Burbules|first3=Nicholas C.|last4=Dash|first4=Leon|last5=Finkin|first5=Matthew|last6=Goldberg|first6=Joseph P.|last7=Greenough|first7=William T.|last8=Miller|first8=Gregory A.|last9=Pratt|first9=Michael G.|date=2016-06-29|title=The Illinois White Paper|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1077800407300785|journal=Qualitative Inquiry|language=en|volume=13|issue=5|pages=617–649|doi=10.1177/1077800407300785}}&lt;/ref&gt; Broad complaints range from the legitimacy of IRB review, the applicability of the concepts of risk as it pertains to social science (e.g., possibly unneeded, over-burdensome requirements), and the requirements for the documentation of participants' informed consent (i.e., consent forms).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Perrault|first1=E. K.|last2=Nazione|first2=S. A.|title=Informed Consent—Uninformed Participants: Shortcomings of Online Social Science Consent Forms and Recommendations for Improvement|journal=Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics|date=2016|volume=11|issue=3|pages=274–280|doi=10.1177/1556264616654610|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/pdf/10.1177/1556264616654610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers have tried to determine under what instances participants are more likely to read informed consent forms, and ways to improve their efficacy in the social sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perrault|first=Evan K.|last2=Keating|first2=David M.|date=2017-11-08|title=Seeking Ways to Inform the Uninformed: Improving the Informed Consent Process in Online Social Science Research|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/10.1177/1556264617738846|journal=Journal of Empirical Research on Human Research Ethics|language=en|doi=10.1177/1556264617738846}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social scientists have criticized biomedical IRBs for failing to adequately understand their research methods (such as ethnography). In 2003, the [[Office for Human Research Protections]] (OHRP), in conjunction with the [[Oral History Association]] and [[American Historical Association]], issued a formal statement that taking [[oral history|oral histories]], unstructured interviews (as if for a piece of journalism), collecting anecdotes, and similar [[free speech]] activities often do not constitute "human subject research" as defined in the regulations and were never intended to be covered by clinical research rules.&lt;ref name=OralHistory&gt;{{Cite journal

Other federal agencies supporting social science have attempted to provide guidance in this area, especially the National Science Foundation. In general, the NSF guidelines assure IRBs that the regulations have some flexibility and rely on the common sense of the IRB to focus on limiting harm, maximizing informed consent, and limiting bureaucratic limitations of valid research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsf.gov/bfa/dias/policy/hsfaqs.jsp|title=FAQs and Vignettes - NSF - National Science Foundation|author=|date=|website=www.nsf.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Adapting IRB review to big data research ==
Aspects of big data research pose formidable challenges for research ethics and thus show potential for wider applicability of formal review processes.&lt;ref name="Chen_2017-09-18"&gt;{{Citation |last=Chen |first=Sophia |date=2017-09-18 |title=AI research is in desperate need of an ethical watchdog |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url=https://www.wired.com/story/ai-research-is-in-desperate-need-of-an-ethical-watchdog/ |access-date=2017-09-18 |doi= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Zhang_2016-05-20"&gt;{{Citation |last=Zhang |first=Sarah |date=2016-05-20 |title=Scientists are just as confused about the ethics of big-data research as you |journal=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |url=https://www.wired.com/2016/05/scientists-just-confused-ethics-big-data-research/ |access-date=2017-09-18 |doi= |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature_550016a"&gt;{{Citation |last=Gibney |first=Elizabeth |date=2017-10-03 |title=Ethics of Internet research trigger scrutiny: Concern over the use of public data spurs guideline update |journal=Nature |doi=10.1038/550016a |url=http://www.nature.com/news/ethics-of-internet-research-trigger-scrutiny-1.22746 |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt; One theme is [[data breach]]es, but another with high difficulty is potentially dangerous [[predictive analytics]] with [[unintended consequences]], via [[type I and type II errors|false-positives]] or new ways to invade [[privacy]]. A 2016 article on the hope to expand ethics reviews of such research included an example of a data breach in which a big data researcher leaked 70,000 [[OkCupid]] profiles with usernames and sexual orientation data.&lt;ref name="Zhang_2016-05-20"/&gt; It also gave an example of potential privacy invasion and government repression in which [[machine learning]] was used to build automated [[gaydar]], labeling strangers as "probably gay" based on their facial photographs.&lt;ref name="Zhang_2016-05-20"/&gt; Analogies with [[phrenology]]&lt;ref name="Chen_2017-09-18"/&gt; and [[History of the Jews in Germany#Jews under the Nazis (1933–45)|Nazis identifying people as "probably part-Jewish"]] based on facial features have been made to show what can go wrong with research whose authors may have failed to adequately think through the risks of harm. Such challenges broach familiar themes, such as [[mistaken identity]], [[precrime]], and [[persecution]], in new applications.

== Managing conflicts of interest ==
While the IRB approval and oversight process is designed to protect the rights and welfare of the [[research subject]]s, it has been the subject of criticism, by bioethicists and others, for [[conflicts of interest]] resulting in lax oversight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.plosmedicine.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pmed.0030309 |title=Should Society Allow Research Ethics Boards to Be Run As For-Profit Enterprises? |publisher=PLOS Medicine |date= |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Caroline McNeil |url=http://jnci.oxfordjournals.org/content/99/7/502.full |title=Debate Over Institutional Review Boards Continues as Alternative Options Emerge |publisher=Jnci.oxfordjournals.org |date=2014-03-03 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2005, the for-profit [[Western Institutional Review Board]] claimed to conduct the majority of reviews for new drug submissions to the FDA.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Elliott |first=Carl |url=http://www.slate.com/articles/health_and_science/medical_examiner/2005/12/ethics_for_sale.html |title=Ethics for sale |publisher=Slate.com |date=2005-12-13 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In a 2006 study of 575 IRB members at university medical centers, over one-third reported industry financial ties and over one-third admitted they "rarely or never" disclosed conflicts of interest to other board members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ahrp.org/cms/content/view/402/100/|title=Hospital IRBs are "On the Take"-Tainted by Conflicts ofInterest_NEJM - AHRP|author=|date=29 November 2006|website=ahrp.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009 the [[Government Accountability Office]] (GAO) set up a series of undercover tests to determine whether the IRB system was vulnerable to unethical manipulation.  In one test, a fake product "Adhesiabloc" was submitted to a number of IRBs for approval for human tests.  The product, company, and CVs of the supposed researchers were all fictitious and documents were forged by the GAO.  The product was deliberately formulated to match some "significant risk" criteria of the FDA and was described by GAO as a "gel that would be poured into a patient’s stomach after surgery to collect the bits and pieces left over from an operation."  Despite this, one IRB approved the device for human testing.  Other IRBs to whom the device was submitted rejected the application, one of them saying it was "the riskiest thing I’ve ever seen on this board".  However, none of the IRBs approached detected that the company and product were fake.  The GAO also set up a fake IRB and obtained requests for approval from companies.  They succeeded in getting assurance approval from the HHS for their fake IRB.  HHS has only three staff to deal with 300 IRB registrations and 300 assurance applications per month.  HHS stated that it would not be worthwhile to carry out additional evaluation even if they had the staff to do it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gao.gov/new.items/d09448t.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=&amp;mdash;By Carl Elliott |url=http://motherjones.com/environment/2010/09/institutional-review-boards |title=Poor Reviews |publisher=Mother Jones |date= |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB124042341694744375 | work=The Wall Street Journal | first=Alicia | last=Mundy | title=Coast IRB, Caught in Sting, to Close | date=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/index.php?q=hearing/institutional-review-boards-that-oversee-experimental-human-testing-for-profit ]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110602161247/http://democrats.energycommerce.house.gov/index.php?q=hearing%2Finstitutional-review-boards-that-oversee-experimental-human-testing-for-profit |date=June 2, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://foodfreedom.wordpress.com/2011/01/17/fda-approves-nonexistent-product-from-nonexistent-company-for-human-testing/ |title=FDA Approves Nonexistent Product from Nonexistent Company for Human Testing &amp;#124; Food Freedom |publisher=Foodfreedom.wordpress.com |date=2011-01-17 |accessdate=2014-03-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Kelu-1''' is a system of two [[brown dwarf]]s of [[spectral type]]s L2 and L4{{r|Dupuy &amp; Liu2012}} located in constellation [[Hydra (constellation)|Hydra]] at approximately 61 [[light-year]]s from [[Earth]].{{r|Dahn2002}} It is among the first free-floating later-than-M-type brown dwarfs discovered, and sometimes considered as prototype of L-type brown dwarfs.{{r|BH}}

==History of observations==

===Discovery===
In 1987 [[María Teresa Ruiz]] decided to start The Calán-ESO proper-motion survey using red plates taken (starting from the 1970s) with the 1-m ESO Schmidt Camera at [[La Silla Observatory]], [[Chile]]. The survey was not specially designed for search for brown dwarfs, but in the main for search for another type of celestial bodies—[[white dwarf]]s. Pairs of plates, separated by long span of time, were compared with [[blink comparator]] to detect objects with high [[proper motion]]. Objects with high proper motion, which were found, were selected for follow-up [[spectroscopy]] using the 3.6-m telescope, equipped with EFOSC1, at the same observatory.

In March 1997 was carried out spectroscopy with the 3.6-m telescope of the next object, discovered from the pair of plates, separated by 14 years (1979—1993) (at the limit of sensitivity: its [[apparent magnitude]] in R band was about 19.5), through its large proper motion, and its spectrum was found very red, very peculiar and very odd-looking. The object's spectrum and its extremely low luminosity led to conclusion that this probably is a brown dwarf. Ruiz et al. named this brown dwarf Kelu-1: «kelu» means «red» in the [[Mapuche language]] (the origin of the second part of the name—the number «1»—is unexplained in the article).&lt;ref name="note 1" group="~"&gt;This is not the only case of using [[Mapuche language|Mapuche]] words in modern astronomy: names of four 8.2-meter [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]] telescopes of [[Paranal Observatory]] (''Antu'',  ''Kueyen'', ''Melipal'' and ''Yepun'') are also originated from Mapuche.&lt;/ref&gt;

Follow-up observations of Kelu-1 include: optical spectroscopy using the [[European Southern Observatory|ESO]] 3.6 m telescope at La Silla (1997 March), [[infrared]] spectroscopy using IRCAM3 and CGS4 on [[United Kingdom Infrared Telescope|UKIRT]] at the [[Mauna Kea Observatory]], [[Hawaii]] (1997 April), and finding chart for Kelu-1 was kindly taken by R. Covarrubias of the [[Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory|Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory (CTIO)]] with the CTIO 0.9 m telescope.

The discovery paper of Kelu-1 by Ruiz et al. was received 1997 September 5, accepted for publication 1997 October 16 and published 1997 November 6 in ''[[The Astrophysical Journal Letters]]''.{{r|Ruiz1997|Eso_Kelu-1}}

===Inclusion to CE Catalog===
In 2001 Ruiz et al. published The Calán-ESO Proper-Motion Catalog (CE Catalog), containing 542 high proper motion stars, detected with ESO 1-m Schmidt Camera plates taken with intervals of time between 6.4 and 16 years. Kelu-1 also was included in this catalog (as object number 298), hence one of its identifiers is '''CE 298'''.{{r|Ruiz2001|Simbad}}

===Assignment of spectral class===
Ruiz et al. did not assign any [[spectral class]] to Kelu-1—in 1997 the latest used in astronomy spectral class was M, but type of Kelu-1 was later than M. In 1999 [[J. Davy Kirkpatrick]] et al. published a paper in ''[[The Astrophysical Journal]]'', in which they introduced two new spectral classes later than M for recently discovered cool objects—brown dwarfs: '''L''' and '''T'''. At the same time in this paper they assigned spectral classes to 26 later-than-M-type brown dwarfs, discovered by 1999: 25 brown dwarfs were assigned class L, including Kelu-1, and one, the coolest, brown dwarf [[Gliese 229 B]] was assigned class T. Kelu-1 was assigned spectral class L2 V.{{r|Kirkpatrick1999}}

===2nd component hypothesis===
In 1997 Ruiz et al. had made two estimates of distance of Kelu-1—from its proper motion, assuming its observed motion is due to Solar System's motion only (about 12 parsecs), and from its apparent magnitude in J band, assuming it is same with that of [[GD 165 B]]—another L-type brown dwarf with similar spectral properties, discovered in 1988 in the system of [[white dwarf]] [[GD 165]]{{r|Becklin1988}} (about 10 parsecs).{{r|Ruiz1997}}

But in 1999 preliminary [[trigonometric parallax]] of Kelu-1, measured under [[U.S. Naval Observatory|USNO]] faint-star parallax program, was obtained, and it turned out that it is located further—at about 19 parsecs, and so it is more luminous than GD 165 B. There were two possible explanations of overluminosity of Kelu-1: it is either young (age less than 0.1 [[Gigayear|Gyr]]) or binary.{{r|Martín1999b}} However, observations of Kelu-1 with near-[[infrared]] camera NICMOS on [[Hubble Space Telescope]] carried out on 1998 August 14, did not reveal the presence of any companion with separation greater than 300 [[milliarcsecond|mas]] and magnitude difference less than 6.7 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|mag]].{{r|Martín1999a|Gelino2006}}

===2nd component discovery===
In 2005 the binarity hypothesis proved true: the second component (Kelu-1 B) was discovered with the [[Laser guide star|Laser Guide Star]] [[Adaptive Optics]] (LGS AO) system on 10-meter [[Keck Observatory|Keck]] II Telescope, [[Mauna Kea Observatory]], [[Hawaii]], by Gelino et al.{{r|Gelino2006}} and independently by Liu and Leggett.{{r|Liu &amp; Leggett2005}}

Gelino et al.observed Kelu-1 with infrared camera NIRC2 using LGS AO system on 2005 March 4 and 2005 April 30, and it appeared to be a binary object with a separation about 290 [[milliarcsecond|mas]]. The binarity was confirmed with [[Hubble Space Telescope|HST]] observations on 2005 July 31 by W. Brandner that were present in the public archive. HST did not detect the companion in 1998 August observations, as it turned out, because its separation increased for 1998—2005 due to orbital motion, and in 1998 it was several times smaller. However, Gelino et al. re-analyzed a 1998 HST observation of Kelu-1 and found that it is best fit by a binary object separated by 45 ± 18 mas. The discovery paper by  Gelino et al. was submitted to ''[[The Publications of the Astronomical Society of the Pacific]]'' on 5 August 2005, and it was published in 2006 April.{{r|Gelino2006}}

Liu &amp; Leggett independently observed Kelu-1 on 2005 May 1 also with NIRC2 using LGS AO system on Keck II Telescope, and also discovered the companion Kelu-1 B (a separation was 291 ± 2 mas). Despite Liu &amp; Leggett had conducted their observations slightly later than Gelino et al., they published their discovery paper of Kelu-1 B earlier—it was received 2005 June 2, accepted for publication 2005 August 1 and published in ''[[The Astrophysical Journal]]'' 2005 November 20.{{r|Liu &amp; Leggett2005}}

===3rd component hypothesis===
In 2005–2008, Stumpf et al. observed Kelu-1 with NICMOS camera of [[Hubble Space Telescope|HST]] and with the [[adaptive optics]] system NACO at the [[European Southern Observatory|ESO]] 8.2-meter telescope [[Very Large Telescope|VLT]]/UT4 (''Yepun'') at [[Paranal Observatory]], [[Chile]] (they also used observations with [[Spitzer Space Telescope]], retrieved from the SPITZER Science Archive).

They obtained orbital parameters and total mass estimate of Kelu-1 system: 177{{±|113|55}} [[Jupiter mass|M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;]]. The mass is too high for a system of two brown dwarfs: an upper limit for brown dwarf mass is 72–75 M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;, so a maximum mass for a system of two brown dwarfs is about 150&amp;nbsp;M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;. Moreover, presence of [[lithium|Li]] absorption in the unresolved spectrum of Kelu-1 indicates that at least one of its components has mass below lithium-burning limit, which is 65&amp;nbsp;M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;.

This may indicate presence of the third component in the system. Another possible explanation of too high mass: it may be an under-prediction of the masses of brown dwarfs, which is already the case for other objects ([[AB Doradus|AB Dor C]], [[Gliese 802|GJ 802 b]] and [[Epsilon Indi|Epsilon Indi Ba, Bb]]).

Also Stumpf et al. revealed a peculiarity in the spectrum of Kelu-1 A, indicating it itself may be an unresolved binary with spectral types of L0.5 ± 0.5 for Kelu-1 Aa and T7.5 ± 1 for Kelu-1 Ab (corresponding to a mass of 18.5&amp;nbsp;M&lt;sub&gt;Jup&lt;/sub&gt;){{r|Stumpf2009}}

===X-rays and attempt of detection in radio===
Kelu-1 system is also a source of [[X-rays]], which was revealed in 2007 by Audard et al. using [[Chandra X-ray Observatory]]. The [[luminosity]] of Kelu-1 in X-rays is L&lt;sub&gt;X&lt;/sub&gt; = 2.9{{±|1.8|1.3}} · 10&lt;sup&gt;25&lt;/sup&gt; [[erg]]·[[second|s]]&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

This was the first detection of X-rays from an L dwarf.

In the same time Audard et al. attempted to detect Kelu-1 in the radio using [[Very Large Array]], but it remained undetected in radio.{{r|Audard2007}}

==Distance==
Currently the most precise distance estimate of Kelu-1 is [[trigonometric parallax]], measured under [[U.S. Naval Observatory|USNO]] faint-star parallax program and published by Dahn et al. in 2002: 53.6 ± 2.0 [[milliarcsecond|mas]], corresponding to a distance 18.7 ± 0.7 [[parsec|pc]], or 60.9 ± 2.3 [[light-year|ly]].{{r|Dahn2002}}

==Early discoveries of brown dwarfs==
Although Kelu-1 is among the first free-floating L dwarfs discovered, it is actually not the first. Three free-floating L dwarfs were found by Xavier Delfosse et al. using the [[Deep Near-Infrared Survey of the Southern Sky|DENIS]] survey (the article was submitted and published in the same 1997, but it was submitted earlier than Ruiz et al. (1997)):{{r|Delfosse1997}}

And one free-floating L dwarf was announced by Kirkpatrick et al. using [[Two Micron All-Sky Survey|2MASS]] prototype observations ("MASP") (the article was submitted in 1996 and published in 1997):{{r|Kirkpatrick1997}}
*[[2MASP J0345432+254023]]

In addition, several free-floating brown dwarfs candidates have been found in the [[Pleiades cluster]] by Rebolo et al. (1996).{{r|Ruiz1997}}

Two early discoveries of not free-floating L and T dwarfs:
*[[Gliese 229 B]] (a T6.5-{{r|Burgasser2002}}type companion to a [[red dwarf]], detected in 1995 by Nakajima et al.){{r|Nakajima1995}}
*[[GD 165 B]] (an L4-{{r|Kirkpatrick1999}}type companion to a [[white dwarf]], detected in 1988 by Becklin and Zuckerman){{r|Becklin1988}}

Furthermore, some of late M-type stars are also considered as brown dwarfs now. Such objects were known even earlier: some of them were included to the [[NLTT]] Catalogue in 1979, for example, [[LP 944-020]].

==Science objectives==

The science objectives of LUCI telescope are primarily to search for transient astronomic events such as [[supernova]]e, [[nova]]e, tidal disruption events by massive [[black hole]]s, and more exotic energetic sources such as [[superluminous supernova]]e and flashes from cosmic collisions which can be very energetic on all scales.&lt;ref name=DNA/&gt;&lt;ref name='Safonova 2014 arxive'&gt; [https://arxiv.org/pdf/1410.3266.pdf Prospect for UV observations from the Moon]. Margarita Safonova, Joice Mathew, Rekhesh Mohan, A. G. Sreejith, Jayant Murthy, Noah Brosch, Norbert Kappelmann, Arpit Sharma and Rahul Narayan. ''ArXive'' 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

LUCI would also look for faint [[asteroid]]s and [[comet]]s in the [[Solar System]], especially for [[near-Earth object]]s (NEO) and [[potentially hazardous object]]s.&lt;ref name=DNA/&gt; The aims are focused on UV sources not accessible by the more sensitive large space missions.&lt;ref name=DNA/&gt; 

==Overview==

The Earth's atmosphere absorbs and scatters UV photons, preventing observations of the active Universe. Placing a telescope on the surface of the Moon is advantageous because of its absence of atmosphere and ionosphere offers an unobstructed view of the space in all wavelengths. The Moon surface provides not just a stable platform, but an inexpensive and long-term access to observations in wavelengths not normally used by large orbital telescope missions. The only UV astronomical observations from the Moon to date were made by [[Apollo 16]] team in 1972.&lt;ref name='Safonova 2014 arxive'/&gt; LUCI project started in 2013 and is funded by the India department of science and technology.&lt;ref name='B Mirror'/&gt; The telescope team is headed by Jayant Murthy.&lt;ref name=DNA&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.dnaindia.com/bangalore/report-bangalore-based-startup-aims-for-the-skies-2007606|title=Bangalore-based startup aims for the skies {{!}} Latest News &amp; Updates at Daily News &amp; Analysis|date=3 August 2014|work=dna|access-date=2017-03-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Design===

LUCI is a small technology demonstrator without 3-axis pointing freedom, so it will rely on the motion of the lunar sky.&lt;ref name='Safonova 2014 arxive'/&gt; The optical system is a two-spherical mirror configuration and a double-pass corrector lens.

(2016)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name='Mathew 2017'/&gt; The detector is an 8 mm UV-sensitive CCD with the response between 200 - 900 nm, so the engineers placed a solar blind filter before the CCD to restrict the bandpass to 200 - 320 nm.&lt;ref name='Mathew 2017'/&gt; 

LUCI is planned to be mostly contained within the lander, and it will be lowered back into its storage bay during the cold lunar nights.&lt;ref name='Safonova 2014 arxive'/&gt; The baseline for LUCI's operation is "a few months".&lt;ref name='Safonova 2014 arxive'/&gt;

A '''marine sandglass''' is a [[timepiece]] of simple design that is a relative of the common [[hourglass]], a marine (nautical) instrument known since the 14th century (although reasonably presumed to be of very ancient use and origin). They were employed to measure the time at sea or on a given [[navigation]]al course, in repeated measures of small time increments (e.g., 30 minutes). Used together with the [[chip log]], smaller marine sandglasses were also used to measure the boat speed through the water in knots.

Although vital to maritime navigation, marine sandglasses were not accurate measuring instruments for the passage of time; many design and environmental factors could affect the duration of sand's flow, and therefore its reported time. Their use continued through the early 19th century, when they were supplanted by reliable [[Marine chronometer|mechanical timepieces]], and by other advances in [[marine navigation]].

Marine sandglasses were very popular on board ships, as they were the most dependable measurement of time while at sea.  Unlike the [[Water clock|clepsydra]], the motion of the ship while sailing did not affect the hourglass.  The fact that the hourglass also used granular materials instead of liquids gave it more accurate measurements, as the clepsydra was prone to get condensation inside it during temperature changes.&lt;ref name="Balmer"&gt;Balmer, R. T. "The Operation of Sand Clocks and Their Medieval Development." Technology and Culture, Vol. 19, No. 4 (Oct., 1978), pp. 615-632 Balmer, R. T. "The Operation of Sand Clocks and Their Medieval Development." Technology and Culture, Vol. 19, No. 4 (Oct., 1978), pp. 615-632.&lt;/ref&gt;  In conjunction with a record of a ship's speed and direction, seamen used the hourglass to determine their position with reasonable accuracy.&lt;ref name="Balmer" /&gt;

==Design and use==
Marine sandglasses originally consisted of two glass bottles one inverted above the other, connected by a small tube, with the ends wrapped and so joined together. Over time, the later progress in the art of [[glassblowing]] allowed them to be made in a single piece. The marine glass was filled with sand or a suitable material such as finely ground eggshell, lead or tin chips (used to avoid humidity). This flowing material was chosen with two main objectives: to avoid the humidity and to absorb motion, both required for shipboard use.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt;

Placed in the upper half, the sand would flow slowly and steadily towards the lower half by the action of gravity, taking a certain time to empty (that was calibrated during their design and manufacture). Once the upper portion of the glass was empty, the glass could be turned to measure another time period.&lt;ref name=MAY&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of Marine Navigation|url=https://books.google.es/books?id=UO5yQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=a+history+of+marine+navigation&amp;hl=ca&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=CVZVVNOsIczbaN-RguAL&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAA| pages=108–110|date=1973| publisher=Norton| isbn=978-0-393-03140-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Antiquity ===
[[File:Peleus-Thetis-350.jpg|thumb|350px |Sarcophagus dated ca 350 AD, representing the wedding of Peleus and Thetis (observe the magnification with the hourglass held by Morpheus in his hands)]]
The origin of the hourglass is unclear, although unlike its predecessor the [[Water clock|clepsydra]], or [[water clock]], which may have been invented in ancient Egypt, the first referenced use:

C.&lt;ref name="York1870"&gt;{{cite book|author=American Institute of the City of New York|title=Annual Report of the American Institute of the City of New York|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3C8LAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA1042|date=1870|publisher=C. van Benthuysen.|pages=1042–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*According to the ''Journal of the British Archaeological Association'': the so-called clepsammia were in use before the time of St Jerome (335 AD) &lt;ref name="Association1873"&gt;{{cite book|author=British Archaeological Association|title=The Journal of the British Archaeological Association|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=eJRYAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA130|date=1873|publisher=Brit.

*M.Llauradó, found during an investigation, the first representation of an hourglass in a sarcophagus dated c. 350 AD, representing the wedding of Peleus and Thetis, discovered in Rome in the 18th century, and studied by Wincklemann in the 19th century, who remarked the hourglass held by Morpheus in his hands.&lt;ref name="Museum1810"&gt;{{cite book|author=British Museum|title=A Description of the Collection of Ancient Terracottas in the British Museum ; with Engravings|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=s4NV9XLg_yUC&amp;pg=PT88|date=1810|publisher=K.

Use of the marine sandglass has been recorded since the 14th century; The written records about it were mostly from logbooks of European ships.&lt;ref name="Mills" /&gt; In the same period it appears in other records and lists of ships stores. The earliest recorded reference that can be said with certainty to refer to a marine sandglass dates from c. 1345, in a receipt of Thomas de Stetesham, clerk of the King's ship ''La George'', in the reign of [[Edward III]] of England; translated from the Latin, the receipt says: in 1345:&lt;ref name="Turner1993"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anthony John Turner|title=Of Time and Measurement: Studies in the History of Horology and Fine Technology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BNDbAAAAMAAJ|date=1993|publisher=Ashgate Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-86078-378-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Stetesham"/&gt;

This "orloge de mer" or "heures de naviguer" was sent to him, as a present, when he still was a prince (being therefore prior to 1356 when he took the place of his imprisoned father), by his aunt [[Yolande of Aragon]], when asking him for a manuscript of [[John de Mandeville]], to be translated to the Aragonese tongue.&lt;ref name="Yolande"&gt;{{cite book|title=Johan I D'Arago|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kb3SJxHaTpUC&amp;pg=PA128|publisher=Institut d'Estudis Catalans|pages=128–|id=GGKEY:8CXSF5T5A0D}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Dotze_Crestia_Valencia_1484.jpg|thumb|Dotzè del Crestià (Valencia-1484)]]
The most interesting thing about the second reference, the one from King Charles, is that a common sand-glass is defined as "ung grant orloge de mer" or "a large sea clock", this together with the fact that the first explanation of its use at sea (found by M.Llauradó) appears in the [[Francesc Eiximenis]] work "[[lo dotzé del crestià]]"&lt;ref name="1409Rogers1988"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Eiximenis, Francesc, ca. 1340-ca. 1409|author2=Donna Mary Rogers|title=A Partial Edition of Francesc Eiximenis' Dotzè Del Crestià (Chs. 1-97) &amp;#91;microform&amp;#93;|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-b2jcQAACAAJ|year=1988|publisher=Thesis (Ph.D.)--University of Toronto|isbn=978-0-315-43411-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that was given to him as a present by his aunt [[Yolande of Aragon]],&lt;ref name="Yolande" /&gt; suggests that, at this period, the importance of a sand-glass was more commonly related to its use at sea and its fabrication demand may have been originated from the navigational needs from the [[Crown of Aragon]] a maritime power of the moment in the Mediterranean.&lt;ref&gt;Diccionari Català Valencià Balear, Alcover-Moll: Rellotge de sorra.

== Importance in navigation ==
[[File:Wooden hourglass 3.jpg|thumb|Sandglass in a three-legged stand]]
In long-distance navigation through the open ocean, the sandglass or "glass" used to measure the time was a tool as important as the compass (which indicated sailing direction, and so ship's course).&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; Filled with the amount of sand suitable for measuring a lapse of half an hour, each time the sand emptied was also called a "glass"; eight glasses (four hours) defined a "watch".&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; The times determined by the sandglass, along with the record in the logbook of the speed measured with the "[[chip log]]", permitted the ship's navigator to plot his map position.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; Multiplying the ship's speed by the time the course had been kept (measured with the glass), gave traveled distance,&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; a simple, overall method termed [[dead reckoning]].&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt;

The marine sandglass was critical for maritime navigation before the 19th century.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; At the beginning of that century it became possible to navigate by the lunar distances, thanks to the tables of [[haversine]]s of [[Josef de Mendoza y Ríos|Joseph de Mendoza y Ríos]].&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; Prior to this, dead reckoning navigation based on sandglass-determined times was used, alongside determination of latitude using the [[quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] (see also [[backstaff]], [[astrolabe]], and [[Octant (instrument)|octant]]);&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; this was the only system available to mariners to navigate the globe.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; The parallel use of relative time measurements at sea, and time measurement by mechanical clocks on land continued from at least 1350 to 1805, i.e., for more than 450 years.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt;

Although vital to navigation, the marine glass was not an accurate instrument to measure the passage of time.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; The design of the glass affected its accuracy in time measurement; the uniformity in fineness of the sand, the inner diameter of the connecting tube, and design aspects allowing wear that would effect the flow of sand all could contribute.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; In addition, many shipboard factors could affect the duration of sand's flow and therefore influence the time measured, including the humidity inside the glass, the ability for it to be positioned in a perfectly vertical position, and the acceleration or deceleration of the ship's movements.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; Finally, the use of short duration glasses to measure long periods of time introduced further error.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; Marine glass use was supplanted by reliable [[Marine chronometer|mechanical timepieces]], and by other advances in [[marine navigation]].&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt;

==Watch sandglasses==
[[Image:Loch à plateau.jpg|right|thumb|300px| Ship log sandglass in the left of the ship's log.]]
Watch sandglasses were used on ships to measure watch times, typically in half-hour periods. The helmsman&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; or ship's page&lt;ref Name=Bergreen&gt;{{Cite book| title = Over the Edge of the World: Magellan's Terrifying Circumnavigation of the Globe | last = Bergreen | first = Laurence | date = 2003 | publisher = William Morrow | ISBN = 0-06-621173-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; were the crewmen responsible for turning the watch sandglass, thus supplying the time to be registered on the ship's log; watch measurement began with the sun reaching its highest point—its [[zenith]]—at midday, which was likewise the essential time reference point for navigation.&lt;ref Name=Bergreen/&gt; At that point in time, the ship's bell was struck eight times; after the first glass had emptied (half an hour), the ship's bell was struck once, after another glass, twice, and so on until four hours after midday, when it was again struck eight times.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; At that point, a new watch began, and the sequence was repeated.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt;

Hence, in the voyages of [[Christopher Columbus|Columbus]], there are records that his crew logged the passage of time using a half-hour "ampolleta" (glass) that was turned every time it emptied to keep track of the "canonical" hours.&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt; Likewise, during the voyage of [[Ferdinand Magellan]] to circumnavigate the globe, 18 hourglasses from Barcelona were in the ship's inventory, after the trip being authorized by emperor Charles V.&lt;ref name="Hakluyt"&gt;{{cite book|author=Pigafetta|title=The First Voyage Around the World, 1519-1522|url=http://www.histo.cat/1/Encomienda-Barna-19-4-1519.jpg|date=1874|publisher=Hakluyt Society Press|isbn=|pages=A12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ship-log sandglass==

From the 16th century a much smaller 30-second "glass" was used along with the [[chip log]], to measure the speed (in knots) of the vessel over the water. The procedure was as follows:&lt;ref name=MAY/&gt;&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"&gt;{{cite book|author=José María Martínez-Hidalgo|title=Enciclopedia general del mar|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CpLgAAAACAAJ|date=1992|publisher=Garriga|isbn=978-84-7079-090-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|

A sailor ran the [[chip log]] and another sailor the sandglass. The slide of the pulled over the stern and let run the first length of line till the quadrant was stabilized in the water. The sailor was leaving to run the line to pass freely leaving the slide by hand and touching the first [[knot (unit)|knot]] sang "mark!" At the moment of the inverted glass and time began to run while the line was counting the knots as they passed until the sandglass sang "mark!" a second blow when they had dropped all the sand, then he caught the firmly the line, measuring the fraction of knot elapsed to the last mark! and cried P.E.: "Five knots and four fathoms!..&lt;ref name="Martínez-Hidalgo1992"/&gt;}}

'''Memorial house museum of Tamara Khanum''', is a museum in [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbekistan]] devoted to [[Uzbek people|Uzbek]] [[dancer]] of [[Armenians|Armenian]] origin [[Tamara Khanum]], opened in 1994 on the basis of a 1986 exhibition of costumes of the actress. The museum is situated in the center of Tashkent, near the [[Hamid Olimjon (Tashkent Metro)|metro station Hamid Alimdzhana]] on the street named after Tamara Khanum. In this house Tamara Khanum lived the last years of her life. The museum was opened while the actress was alive.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.advantour.com/uzbekistan/tashkent/tamara-khanum-museum.htm Memorial House Museum of Tamara Khanum.

'''Nectar''' is a [[sugar]]-rich liquid produced by plants in glands called '''nectaries''', either within the [[flower]]s with which it attracts [[pollination|pollinating]] animals, or by '''extrafloral nectaries''', which provide a nutrient source to animal [[Mutualism (biology)|mutualists]], which in turn provide [[plant defense against herbivory#Indirect defenses|antiherbivore protection]].  Common nectar-consuming [[pollinator]]s include [[mosquito]]es, [[hoverfly|hoverflies]], [[wasp]]s, [[bee]]s, [[butterfly|butterflies]] and [[moth]]s, [[hummingbird]]s, and [[Bat#Fruits and flower nectar|bats]]. Nectar plays an important role in the foraging economics and overall evolution of nectar-eating species; for example, nectar and its properties are responsible for the differential evolution of the African honey bee, [[African bee|''A. m. scutellata'']] and the [[western honey bee]].

Nectar is an ecologically important item, the sugar source for [[honey]]. It is also useful in [[agriculture]] and [[horticulture]] because the adult stages of some predatory insects feed on nectar. For example, the social wasp species ''[[Apoica flavissima]]'' relies on nectar as a primary food source. In turn, these wasps then hunt agricultural pest insects as food for their young. For example, thread-waisted wasps ([[genus]] ''[[Ammophila (Sphecidae)|Ammophila]]'') are known for hunting [[caterpillar]]s that are destructive to crops. Caterpillars however, do eventually become butterflies and moths, which are very important pollinators. {{citation needed|date=November 2012}}

Nectar secretion increases as the flower is visited by pollinators. After pollination, the nectar is frequently reabsorbed into the plant.&lt;ref name="iastate"/&gt;

==Etymology==

''Nectar'' is derived from [[Greek language|Greek]] ''nektar'', the [[fable|fabled]] drink of [[Greek mythology|Greek gods]].&lt;ref name="eol"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/nectar|title=Nectar|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary, Douglas Harper|date=2018|accessdate=28 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word is derived as a compound of ''nek'', meaning death, and ''tar'', meaning the ability to overcome.&lt;ref name=eol/&gt; The common use of nectar refers to the "sweet liquid in flowers", first recorded in [[AD]] 1600.&lt;ref name=eol/&gt;

==Floral nectaries==
 
A nectary is floral [[tissue (biology)|tissue]] found in different locations in the flower.  The different types of floral nectaries include septal nectaries found on the [[sepal]], [[petal]] nectaries, staminal nectaries found on the [[stamen]], and gynoecial nectaries found on the [[ovary]] tissue.  The nectaries also may vary in color, number, and symmetry.&lt;ref&gt;Willmer, Pat. Pollination and floral ecology. Princeton University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nectaries can also be categorized as structural or non-structural.  Structural nectaries refer to specific areas of tissue that exude nectar, such as the types of floral nectaries previously listed.  Non-structural nectaries secrete nectar infrequently from non-differentiated tissues.&lt;ref&gt;Nicolson, Susan W., Massimo Nepi, and Ettore Pacini, eds. Nectaries and nectar. Vol. 4. Dordrecht: Springer, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  The different types of floral nectaries [[coevolved]] depending on the pollinator that feeds on the plant's nectar.   Nectar is secreted from [[epidermal]] cells of the nectaries by means of [[trichomes]] or modified [[stomata]].   The nectar comes from [[phloem]] with additional [[sugars]] that are secreted from the cells through [[vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]s packaged by the [[endoplasmic reticulum]].&lt;ref&gt;Fahn, Abraham. “On the Structure of Floral Nectaries.” Botanical Gazette, vol. 113, no. 4, 1952, pp. 464–470. JSTOR, JSTOR, www.jstor.org/stable/2472434.&lt;/ref&gt; Flowers that have longer nectaries sometimes have a [[vascular]] strand in the nectary to assist in transport over a longer distance.&lt;ref&gt;Wallace, Gary D. "Studies of the Monotropoideae (Ericaceae). Floral nectaries: anatomy and function in pollination ecology." American Journal of Botany (1977): 199-206.&lt;/ref&gt;.  

Floral nectaries are used by plants to attract [[pollinators]] such as [[insects]], [[hummingbirds]], and other [[vertebrates]].  The pollinators feed on the nectar and depending on the location of the nectary the pollinator assists in [[fertilization]] and [[outcrossing]] of the plant as they brush against the reproductive organs, the [[stamen]] and [[pistil]], of the plant and pick up or deposit [[pollen]].&lt;ref&gt;Heil, Martin. "Nectar: generation, regulation and ecological functions." Trends in plant science 16.4 (2011): 191-200.&lt;/ref&gt;  Nectar from floral nectaries is sometimes used as a reward to insects, such as [[ants]], that protect the plant from predators.  Many floral families have evolved a nectar [[spur]].  These spurs are projections of various lengths formed from different tissues, such as the petals or sepals.  They allow for pollinators to land on the elongated tissue and more easily reach the nectaries and obtain the nectar reward.&lt;ref&gt;Willmer, Pat. Pollination and floral ecology. Princeton University Press, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;  Different characteristics of the spur, such as its length or position in the flower, may determine the type of pollinator that visits the flower.&lt;ref&gt;Pacini, E. N. M. V. J., M. Nepi, and J. L. Vesprini. "Nectar biodiversity: a short review." Plant Systematics and Evolution 238.1-4 (2003): 7-21.&lt;/ref&gt;  

Defense from [[herbivory]] is often one of the roles of extrafloral nectaries.  Floral nectaries can also be involved in defense.  In addition to the [[sugars]] found in nectar, certain [[proteins]] may also be found in nectar secreted by floral nectaries.  In [[tobacco]] plants, these proteins have [[antimicrobial]] and [[antifungal]] properties and can be secreted to defend the [[gynoecium]] from certain pathogens.&lt;ref&gt;Thornburg, Robert W., et al. "A major function of the tobacco floral nectary is defense against microbial attack." Plant Systematics and Evolution 238.1-4 (2003): 211-218.&lt;/ref&gt;     

Floral nectaries have [[evolved]] and diverged into the different types of nectaries due to the various pollinators that visit the flowers.  In [[Melastomataceae]], different types of floral nectaries have evolved and been lost many times.  Flowers that ancestrally produced nectar and had nectaries may have lost their ability to produce nectar due to a lack of nectar consumption by pollinators, such as certain species of [[bees]].  Instead they focused on energy allocation to [[pollen]] production.  Species of [[angiosperms]] that have nectaries use the nectar to attract pollinators that consume the nectar, such as [[birds]] and [[butterflies]].&lt;ref&gt;Stein, Bruce A., and Hiroshi Tobe. "Floral nectaries in Melastomataceae and their systematic and evolutionary implications." Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden (1989): 519-531.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Bromeliaceae]], septal nectaries are common in species that are insect or bird pollinated.  In species that are wind pollinated, nectaries are often absent because there is no pollinator to provide a reward for.&lt;ref&gt;Floral anatomy of Bromeliaceae, with particular reference to the evolution of epigyny and septal nectaries in commelinid monocotSajo, M. G., P. J. Rudall, and C. J. Prychid. "Floral anatomy of Bromeliaceae, with particular reference to the evolution of epigyny and septal nectaries in commelinid monocots." Plant Systematics and Evolution 247.3-4 (2004): 215-231.&lt;/ref&gt; In flowers that are generally pollinated by long-tongued organism such as certain [[flies]], [[moths]], butterflies, and birds, nectaries in the ovaries are common because they are able to reach the nectar reward when pollinating.  Septal and petal nectaries are often more common in species that are pollinated by short-tongued insects that cannot reach so far into the flower.&lt;ref&gt;Rudall, Paula J., John C. Manning, and Peter Goldblatt. "Evolution of floral nectaries in Iridaceae." Annals of the Missouri Botanical Garden (2003): 613-631.&lt;/ref&gt;

Extrafloral nectaries (also known as extranuptial nectaries) are nectar-secreting plant glands that develop outside of flowers and are not involved in [[pollination]].&lt;ref name="Heil"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Heil | first1 = M.| last2 = Fiala | first2 = B.| last3 = Baumann | first3 = B. | last4 = Linsenmair | first4 = K.E. | title = Temporal, spatial and biotic variations in extrafloral nectar secretion by ''Macaranga tanarius'' | doi = 10.1046/j.1365-2435.2000.00480.x | journal = Functional Ecology | volume = 14 | issue = 6 | pages = 749 | year = 2000 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; They are highly diverse in form, location, size, and mechanism.

In contrast to floral nectaries, nectar produced outside the flower generally have a defensive function. The nectar attracts predatory insects which will eat both the nectar and any [[herbivore|plant-eating]] insects around, thus functioning as 'bodyguards'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cambridge.org/uk/catalogue/catalogue.asp?isbn=0521819415 Plant-Provided Food for Carnivorous Insects - Cambridge University Press&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; Foraging predatory insects show a preference for plants with extrafloral nectaries, particularly some species of [[ant]]s and [[wasp]]s, which have been observed to directly defend the plants.&lt;ref name="Heil"/&gt; Among [[Passiflora|passion flowers]], for example, extrafloral nectaries prevent herbivores by attracting ants and deterring two species of butterflies from laying eggs.&lt;ref name="sezen"&gt;{{cite web|last=Sezen|first=Uzay|title=Ants defending extrafloral nectaries of the passion flower (''Passiflora incarnata'')|url=http://vimeo.com/34448448|accessdate=6 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many [[carnivorous plant]]s, extrafloral nectaries are also used to attract insect [[prey]].&lt;ref&gt;Merbach, M. 2001. Nectaries in ''Nepenthes''. In: C.M. Clarke ''[[Nepenthes of Sumatra and Peninsular Malaysia]]''. Natural History Publications (Borneo), Kota Kinabalu.&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin understood that extrafloral nectar "though small in quantity, is greedily sought by insects" but believe the "their visits do not in any way benefit the plant".&lt;ref name="mancuso"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mancuso | first1 = S. | title = Federico Delpino and the foundation of plant biology | doi = 10.4161/psb.5.9.12102 | journal = Plant Signaling &amp; Behavior | volume = 5 | issue = 9 | pages = 1067–1071 | year = 2010 | pmid =  21490417| pmc = 3115070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Instead, he believed that extrafloral nectaries were [[Excretion|excretory]] in nature ([[hydathode]]s). Their defensive functions were first recognized by the [[Italian people|Italian]] [[botanist]] [[Federico Delpino]] in his important [[monograph]] ''Funzione mirmecofila nel regno vegetale'' (1886). Delpino's study was inspired by a disagreement with  [[Charles Darwin]], with whom he corresponded regularly.&lt;ref name="mancuso"/&gt;

Extrafloral nectaries have been reported in over 3941 species of [[vascular plant]]s belonging to 745 [[genus|genera]] and 108 [[family (biology)|families]], 99.7% of which belong to [[flowering plant]]s (angiosperms), comprising 1.0 to 1.8% of all known species. They are most common among [[eudicot]]s, occurring in 3642 species (of 654 genera and 89 families), particularly among [[rosids]] which comprise more than half of the known occurrences. The families showing the most recorded occurrences of extrafloral nectaries are [[Fabaceae]], with 1069 species, [[Passifloraceae]], with 438 species, and [[Malvaceae]], with 301 species. The genera with the most recorded occurrences are ''[[Passiflora]]'' (322 species, Passifloraceae), ''[[Inga]]'' (294 species, Fabaceae), and ''[[Acacia]]'' (204 species, Fabaceae).&lt;ref name="weber&amp;keeler2012"/&gt; Other genera with extrafloral nectaries include ''[[Salix]]'' ([[Salicaceae]]), ''[[Prunus]]'' ([[Rosaceae]]) and ''[[Gossypium]]'' ([[Malvaceae]]).&lt;ref name="sezen"/&gt;

Foliar nectaries have also been observed in 39 species of [[fern]]s belonging to seven genera and four families of [[Cyatheales]] and [[Polypodiales]].&lt;ref name="weber&amp;keeler2012"/&gt; They are absent, however, in [[bryophyte]]s, [[gymnosperm]]s, early [[angiosperm]]s, [[magnoliids]], and members of [[Apiales]] among the eudicots.&lt;ref name="weber&amp;keeler2012"/&gt; [[Phylogenetic]] studies and the wide distribution of extrafloral nectaries among vascular plants point to multiple independent [[evolution]]ary origins of extrafloral nectaries in at least 457 independent lineages.&lt;ref name="weber&amp;keeler2012"/&gt;

==Components==
The main ingredients in nectar are sugars in varying proportions of [[sucrose]], [[glucose]], and [[fructose]].&lt;ref name="Chalcoff Ann.

The ''Nicotiana attenuata'', a tobacco plant native to the US state of [[Utah]], uses several [[volatility (chemistry)|volatile]] aromas to attract pollinating birds and moths. The strongest such aroma is [[benzylacetone]], but the plant also adds bitter [[nicotine]], which is less aromatic, so may not be detected by the bird until after taking a drink. Researchers speculate the purpose of this addition is to discourage the forager after only a sip, motivating it to visit other plants, therefore maximizing the pollination efficiency gained by the plant for a minimum nectar output.&lt;ref name=swn/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Chemical &amp; Engineering News]], Vol. 86 No. 35, 1 Sept. 2008, "Two-Faced Flowers", p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; Neurotoxins such as [[aesculin]] are present in some nectars such as that of the [[California buckeye]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.globaltwitcher.com/artspec_info.asp?thingid=82383 C.Michael Hogan (2008) ''Aesculus californica'', Globaltwitcher.com, ed.

'''Non-formal learning''' includes various structured [[learning]] situations which do not either have the level of [[curriculum]], [[syllabus]], [[Educational accreditation|accreditation]] and [[certification]] associated with '[[formal learning]]', but have more structure than that associated with '[[informal learning]]', which typically take place naturally and spontaneously as part of other activities. These form the three styles of learning recognised and supported by the [[Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development|OECD]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oecd.org/education/skills-beyond-school/recognitionofnon-formalandinformallearning-home.htm|title=Recognition of Non-formal and Informal Learning - Home|publisher=OECD}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of non-formal learning include swimming sessions for toddlers, community-based sports programs, and programs developed by organisations such as the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], the [[Girl Guides]], community or non-credit [[adult education]] courses, sports or fitness programs, professional conference style [[seminar]]s, and continuing professional development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Eaton, Sarah Elaine|title=Formal, Non-Formal and Informal Learning|url=http://www.infed.org/archives/e-texts/eaton_formal_nonformal_informal_learning.htm |date =22 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The learner’s objectives may be to increase skills and knowledge, as well as to experience the emotional rewards associated with increased love for a subject or increased passion for learning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quality guide to non-formal and informal learning processes|url=http://www.menon.org/publications/TQM%20Guide%20for%20informal%20learning.pdf|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5wT2umMVj|date =2004|archive-date=13 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The debate over the relative value of formal and informal learning has existed for a number of years. Traditionally formal learning takes place in a [[school]] or [[university]] and has a greater value placed upon it than informal learning, such as learning within the workplace. This concept of formal learning being the socio-cultural accepted norm for learning was first challenged by Scribner and Cole&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|authors=Scribner, S. and Cole, M.|year=1973|title=Cognitive Consequences of Formal and Informal Education, Science|pages=182, 553–559}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1973, who claimed most things in life are better learnt through informal processes, citing [[language learning]] as an example. Moreover, anthropologists noted that complex learning still takes place within indigenous communities that had no formal educational institutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Lave, J. and Wenger, E.|year=1991|title=Situated Learning: Legitimate Peripheral Participation|publisher=Cambridge: Cambridge University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It’s the acquisition of this knowledge or learning which occurs in everyday life that has not been fully valued or understood. This led to the declaration by the OECD educational ministers of the "[[life-long learning]] for all"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=OCED|title=Lifelong Learning for All|url=http://www.oecdbookshop.org/browse.asp?pid=title-detail&amp;lang=en&amp;ds=&amp;k=5LMQCR2K9XLP|year=1996}}&lt;/ref&gt; strategy in 1996. This includes 23 countries from five continents, who have sought to clarify and validate all forms of learning including formal, non-formal and informal. This has been in conjunction with the [[European Union]] which has also developed policies for life-long learning which focus strongly on the need to identify, assess and certify non-formal and informal learning, particularly in the workplace.{{citation needed|date=December 2015}}

==Formal and informal learning==

Although all definitions can be contested (see below) this article shall refer to the [[European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training]] (Cedefop) 2001 communication on 'lifelong learning: formal, non-formal and informal learning' as the guideline for the differing definitions.

'''Formal learning''': learning typically provided by an education or training institution, structured (in terms of learning objectives, learning time or learning support) and leading to certification. Formal learning is intentional from the learner’s perspective. (Cedefop 2001)&lt;ref name="europa1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary of key terms|url=http://www.cedefop.europa.eu/EN/about-cedefop/projects/validation-of-non-formal-and-informal-learning/european-inventory-glossary.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Informal learning''': learning resulting from daily life activities related to work, family or leisure. It is not structured (in terms of learning objectives, learning time or learning support) and typically does not lead to certification. Informal learning may be intentional but in most cases it is not-intentional (or "incidental"/random). (Cedefop 2001)&lt;ref name="europa1"/&gt;

'''Non-formal learning''': see definition above.

==Contested definitions==
If there is no clear distinction between formal and in-formal learning where is the room for non-formal learning. It is a contested issue with numerous definitions given. The following are some the competing theories.

'''''"It is difficult to make a clear distinction between formal and informal learning as there is often a crossover between the two."''''' (McGivney, 1999, p1).&lt;ref&gt;[McGivney, V. (1999) Informal learning in the community: a trigger for change and development (Leicester: NIACE). Cited in ‘Helen Colley, Phil Hodkinson &amp; Janice Malcolm (2002) Non-formal learning: mapping the conceptual terrain. A Consultation Report, Leeds: University of Leeds Lifelong Learning Institute. Also available in the informal education archives: http://www.infed.org/archives/e-texts/colley_informal_learning.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Hodkinson et al. (2003), conclude after a significant literature analysis on the topics of formal, informal, and non-formal learning, that "the terms informal and non-formal appeared interchangeable, each being primarily defined in opposition to the dominant formal education system, and the largely individualist and acquisitional conceptualisations of learning developed in relation to such educational contexts." (Hodkinson et al., 2003, p.&amp;nbsp;314)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hodkinson|first=Phil |author2=Colley, Hellen |author3=Janice Malcolm|title=The Interrelationships Between Informal and Formal Learning|journal=Journal of Workplace Learning|year=2003|volume=15|pages=313–318}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, he states that "It is important not to see informal and formal attributes as somehow separate, waiting to be integrated. This is the dominant view in the literature, and it is mistaken. Thus, the challenge is not to, somehow, combine informal and formal learning, for informal and formal attributes are present and inter-related, whether we will it so or not. The challenge is to recognise and identify them, and understand the implications. For this reason, '''the concept of non-formal learning, at least when seen as a middle state between formal and informal, is redundant'''." (p.&amp;nbsp;314)

''Eraut's&lt;ref&gt;[Eraut, M. (2000) Non-formal learning, implicit learning and tacit knowledge, in F. Coffield (Ed) The Necessity of Informal Learning, Bristol: Policy Press (2000)]&lt;/ref&gt; classification of learning into formal and non-formal'':

This removes informal learning from the equation and states all learning outside of formal learning is non-formal. Eraut equates informal with connotations of dress, language or behaviour that have no relation to learning. Eraut defines formal learning as taking place within a learning framework; within a classroom or learning institution, with a designated teacher or trainer; the award of a qualification or credit; the external specification of outcomes. Any learning that occurs outside of these parameters is non-formal. (Ined 2002)&lt;ref name="infed1"&gt;[Ined:Non-Formal Learning http://www.infed.org/archives/e-texts/colley_informal_learning.htm]&lt;/ref&gt;

''The EC (2001) Communication on Lifelong Learning: formal, non-formal and informal learning'':

The EU places non-formal learning in between formal and informal learning (see above). This has learning both in a formal setting with a learning framework and as an organised event but within a qualification. "Non-formal learning: learning that is not provided by an education or training institution and typically does not lead to certification. It is, however, structured (in terms of learning objectives, learning time or learning support). Non-formal learning is intentional from the learner’s perspective." (Cedefop 2001)&lt;ref name="europa1"/&gt;

''Livingstone's&lt;ref&gt;[Livingstone, D.W. (2001) Adults’ Informal Learning: Definitions, Findings, Gaps and Future Research, Toronto: OISE/UT (NALL Working Paper No.21) at http://www.oise.utoronto.ca/depts/sese/csew/nall/res/21adultsifnormallearning.htm,(2001)]&lt;/ref&gt; adults formal and informal education, non-formal and informal learning'':

This focuses on the idea of adult non-formal education. This new mode, ‘informal education’ is when teachers or mentors guide learners without reference to structured learning outcomes. This informal education learning is gaining knowledge without an imposed framework, such as learning new job skills. (Infed, 2002)&lt;ref name="infed1"/&gt;

''Billett&lt;ref&gt;[Billett, S. (2001a) Participation and continuity at work: A critique of current workplace learning discourses, paper given at the conference Context, Power and Perspective: Confronting the Challenges to Improving Attainment in Learning at Work, Sunley Management Centre, University College Northampton, 8 –10 November]&lt;/ref&gt; (2001): there is no such thing as informal learning'':

Billet's definition states there is no such thing as non-formal and informal learning. He states all human activity is learning, and that everything people do involves a process of learning. "all learning takes place within social organisations or communities that have formalised structures." Moreover, he states most learning in life takes place outside of formal education.(Ined 2002)&lt;ref name="infed1"/&gt;

==Validation==

Recently, many [[international organization]]s and [[UNESCO]] Member States have emphasized the importance of learning that takes place outside of formal learning settings. This emphasis has led UNESCO, through its [[UNESCO Institute for Lifelong Learning|Institute of Lifelong Learning]] (UIL), to adopt international guidelines for the Recognition, Validation and Accreditation of the Outcomes of Non-formal and Informal Learning in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;UIL. 2012. ''Guidelines for the Recognition, Validation and Accreditation of the Outcomes of Non-formal and Informal Learning''. Hamburg, Germany, UIL.&lt;/ref&gt;  The emphasis has also led to an increasing number of policies and programmes in many Member States, and a gradual shift from pilots to large-scale systems such as those in Portugal, France, Australia, Mauritius and South Africa.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002428/242887e.pdf|title=Level-setting and recognition of learning outcomes: The use of level descriptors in the twenty-first century|last=Keevy|first=James|last2=Chakroun|first2=Borhene|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100138-3|location=|pages=114}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[European Centre for the Development of Vocational Training|Cedefop]] has created European guidelines to provide validation to a broad range of learning experiences, thereby aiding transparency and comparability across its national borders. The broad framework for achieving this certification across both non-formal and informal learning is outlined in the Cedefop European guidelines for validating non-formal and informal learning; Routes from learning to certification.&lt;ref&gt;[European guidelines for validating non-formal and informal learning; Routes from learning to certification. figure 2 p.18. http://www.cedefop.europa.eu/EN/Files/4054_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Different countries' approaches==

There are different approaches to validation between OCED and EU countries, with countries adopting different measures. The EU, as noted above, through the Cedefop-released European guidelines for validating non-formal and informal learning in 2009 to standardise validation throughout the EU. Within the OCED countries, the picture is more mixed.

== Flexible schooling or participatory schooling ==

Non-formal education (NFE) is popular on a worldwide scale in both 'western' and 'developing countries'. Non-formal education can form a matrix with formal and non-formal education, as non-formal education can mean any form of systematic learning conducted outside the formal setting. Many courses in relation to non-formal education have been introduced in several universities in western and developing countries.

The UNESCO institute of education conducted a seminar on non-formal [[education in Morocco]]. The association for development of education in Africa (ADEA) launched many programmes in non-formal education in at least 15 countries of Sub-Saharan Africa. In 2001 World Bank conducted an international seminar on basic education in non-formal programmes. In addition to this the World Bank was advised to extend its services to adult and non-formal education.

A report on vocational education, Making Learning Visible: the identification, assessment and recognition of non-formal learning in Europe, defines non-formal learning as semi structured, consisting of planned and explicit approaches to learning introduced into work organisations and elsewhere, not recognised within the formal education and training system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Alan Rogers|title=Non-Formal Education: Flexible Schooling or Participatory Education?|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=pQQcOj3Iu1QC&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PP8&amp;dq=non+formal+education&amp;ots=JpjgCLrr9p&amp;sig=jGiHsF0HZOG3EcyTtcrE5FDewnc#v=onepage&amp;q=non%20formal%20education&amp;f=false|ref=book}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Types ==

Community work, which is particularly widespread in Scotland, fosters people's  commitment to their neighbours and encourages participation in and development of local democratic forms of organisation.

Youth work which focuses on making people more active in the society.

Social work which helps young people in homes to develop ways to deal with complex situations like fostering fruitful relationships between parents and children, bringing different groups of career together, etc...

In France and Italy animation in a particular form is a kind of non-formal education. It uses theatre and acting as means of self-expression with different community groups for children and people with special needs. This type of non-formal education helps in ensuring active participation and teaches people to manage the community in which they live.

Youth and community organisations young people have the opportunity  to discover, analyse and understand values and their implications and build a set of values to guide their lives. They run work camps and meetings, recruit volunteers, administer bank acoounts, give counselling etc. to work toward social change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Mr Cristian Dumitrescu|title=Non formal education|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/X2H-Xref-ViewHTML.asp?FileID=8807&amp;lang=en|work=Report|agency=Committee on Culture and Education|date=15 December 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Importance ==

Education plays an important role in  development. Out of school programmes are important to provide adaptable learning opportunities and new skills and knowledge to a large percentage of people who are beyond the reach of formal education. Non-formal education began to gain popularity in the late 1960s and early 1970s. Today, non-formal education is seen as a concept of recurrent and lifelong learning.

Non-formal education is popular among the adults specially the women as it increases women's participation in both private and public activities, i.e. in house hold decision making and as active citizens in the community affairs and national development. These literacy programmes have a dramatic impact on women's self-esteem because they unleash their potential in economic, social, cultural and political spheres.

According to UNESCO (2010), non-formal education helps to ensures equal access to education, eradicate illiteracy among women and improve women's access to vocational training, science, technology and continuing education. It also encourages the development of non-discriminatory education and training. The effectiveness of such literacy and non-formal education programmes are bolstered  by family, community and parental involvement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Department of Educational Foundations and Management|title=A Critical Assessment of the Role/Importance of Non-Formal Education to Human and National Development in Nigeria: Future Trends|url=http://www.ijsre.com/Vol.,%205_2_-Ololube%20&amp;%20Egbezor.pdf|ref=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Advantages ==

Non-formal education is beneficial in a number of ways. There are activities that encourage young people to choose their own programme and projects that are important because they offer the youth the flexibility and freedom to explore their emerging interests. When the youth can choose the activities in which they can participate, they have opportunities to develop several skills like decision making skills.

Non-formal learning has experiential learning activities that foster the development of skills and knowledge. This helps in building the confidence and abilities among the youth of today. It also helps in development of personal relationships not only among the youth but also among the adults. It helps in developing interpersonal skills among the young people as they learn to interact with peers outside the class and with adults in the community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stephen T. Russell|title=The Developmental Benefits of Nonformal Education and Youth Development|issue=The University of California, Davis|url=http://www.ca4h.org/files/1231.pdf|ref=journal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Disadvantages ==

There are drawbacks to non-formal education which include that non-formal learning is not based on curriculum but based on experience. There is low efficiency in non-formal education.{{Citation needed|date=June 2017}}

== Necessity ==

Formal education system are inadequate to effectively meet the needs of the individual and the society. The need to offer more and better education at all levels, to a growing number of people, particularly in developing countries, the scant success of current formal education systems to meet all such demands, has shown the need to develop alternatives to learning.

The rigid structure of formal schools, mainly because of rules and regulations than concentrating on the real need of the students, offering curriculum that leans away from the individual and from society, far more concerned with performing programmes than reaching useful objectives. This called for non-formal education which starting from the basic need of the students, is concerned with the establishment of strategies that are compatible with reality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Claudio Zaki Dib|title=FORMAL, NON-FORMAL AND INFORMAL EDUCATION: CONCEPTS/APPLICABILITY|url=http://www.techne-dib.com.br/downloads/6.pdf|publisher=stitute of Physics University of São Paulo, Brazil|ref=pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Norwegian College of Fishery Science''' (NCFS or in Norwegian NFH: Norges fiskerihøgskole) was established in 1972 as a joint responsibility of the three Norwegian universities in Tromsø, Bergen and Trondheim. In 1988, a new organisational structure was introduced as NCFS was located to Tromsø and organized as a faculty at the [[University of Tromsø]], keeping some degree of autonomy as its own rector etc. NCFS has a particular responsibility for the development of fundamental and scientific expertise within all areas of [[Fishery|fisheries]] and [[aquaculture]] research in [[Norway]]. NCFS is also responsible for educating candidates for employment in the [[fishing industry]] and [[fisheries management]].

In 2004, NCFS established [[Centre of Marine Resource Management]], also known as the MaReMa Centre, to promote multidisciplinary research in the area of fisheries and [[Integrated coastal zone management|coastal zone management]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9030">A '''paraprofessional educator''', alternatively known as a '''para''', '''para-pro''', '''paraeducator''', '''instructional assistant''', '''educational assistant''', '''teacher's aide''' or '''classroom assistant''', is a [[teaching]]-related position within a school generally responsible for specialized or concentrated assistance for [[student]]s in [[elementary school|elementary]] and [[secondary school]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Zehrbach, Reid, et al. (1972) ''Paraprofessional Educator Manager: A New Professional Role in Early Childhood Education.'' 	Illinois Univ., Urbana. Inst. of Research for Exceptional Children. ERIC # ED064816.&lt;/ref&gt;

Not all countries and states have a fixed definition of "paraprofessional" and may use all of the terms listed above, and many others, interchangeably.

== By country ==
Paraprofessionals are widely employed in schools in the United States and Canada, and in some European countries.

In England and Wales, the term used for education paraprofessionals is Teaching Assistant (TA). In recent years, legislation has been introduced which enables teachers to delegate a range of tasks to their TAs. Teaching Assistants in England and Wales can apply for Higher Level Teaching Assistant (HLTA) status, which requires them to document the ways in which their work meets a set of specified criteria. Those with HLTA status can substitute for teachers and (where appropriate) supervise other TAs. Scotland uses the term "classroom assistant" rather than "teaching assistant" as teaching is strictly not part of an assistant's responsibilities there.

In Canada, they are widely known as Educational Assistants to emphasize their role in educating special needs students.

In Japan, foreign native speakers employed as paraprofessional language educators (primarily English) are known as [[Assistant Language Teacher]]s. Similar institutions exist in Germany and France where they are known as [[Foreign Language Assistant]]s.

==Duties==
Paraprofessional educators generally assist [[teacher]]s in the [[classroom]], supervise students outside of the classroom, or provide administrative support for teaching.&lt;ref name=BLS&gt;Teacher Assistants in the [http://www.bls.gov/oco/ocos153.htm Occupational Outlook Handbook] 2010-11 Edition&lt;/ref&gt; Job duties range from filling teaching positions to supplementing regular classroom [[curriculum]] with additional enrichment activities for students. Other positions include classroom aides, special education aides, school library technical assistants, and tutors.

Some paraprofessionals work directly with students, in which case they may listen to students practice reading aloud, help students understand and complete their assignments, or assist students with special needs.&lt;ref name=BLS /&gt;  

Many paraprofessionals are assigned to supervise groups of students who are eating, playing outside, or on [[field trip]]s. They may be assigned to perform clerical work for a teacher, in which case they may grade assignments, type up records for attendance or grades, set up equipment, and help prepare [[Instructional_materials|materials for instruction]], e.g., by making photocopies of worksheets.&lt;ref name=BLS /&gt; 

Many teacher assistants work primarily or exclusively with students who have special educational needs. Their duties vary according to the needs of the student, and may include physical care for students who are unable to care for themselves (such as feeding, lifting, moving, or cleaning), behavioral management, or academic assistance.&lt;ref name=BLS /&gt;

Some paraprofessionals don't work with the school directly, rather the school district.  Paraprofessionals can work in other programs that the school district provide, such as [[Childcare|school aged childcare]] and recess/ lunch duties. This links the paraprofessional to the students, but not the teacher or schools itself.  

The role of the paraprofessional educator is constantly evolving. Today, more than ever, paraprofessionals are teaching lessons, working with small groups for remediation, leading extracurricular clubs/sports and are no longer simply the "teacher's aide" of the past.

==Requirements==
Requirements to become a paraprofessional vary widely, normally ranging from a [[high school diploma]], [[G.E.D.]], two years of [[college]] education, or an [[associate degree]]. Some positions may require experience, particularly as an aide in an instructional role like in [[special education]] and in [[English as a Second Language]] instruction.

===Regulation===
In the United States, the [[No Child Left Behind]] federal legislation requires that educational paraprofessionals be "highly qualified".&lt;ref&gt;[http://arkedu.state.ar.us/commemos/static/fy0203/1623.html Paraprofessional certification.] Arkansas State Department of Education.&lt;/ref&gt; The definition of highly qualified is left to the individual states, as are the means for measuring qualification. The [[United States Department of Education]] has issued guidelines regarding paraprofessionals whose positions are funded under [[Title&amp;nbsp;I]] of the federal legislation. According to the Department of Education, "Paraprofessionals who provide instructional support", include those who:
#Provide one-on-one tutoring if such tutoring is scheduled at a time when a student would not otherwise receive instruction from a teacher,
#Assist with classroom management, such as by organizing instructional materials,
#Provide instructional assistance in a computer laboratory,
#Conduct parental involvement activities,
#Provide instructional support in a library or media center,
#Act as a translator, or
#Provide instructional support services under the direct supervision of a highly qualified teacher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ed.gov/policy/elsec/guid/paraguidance.doc Title I, Section 1119(g)(2): Paraprofessional Guidance], U.S. Department of Education. Retrieved 2/9/08.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Certification===
Some jurisdictions offer or require certification for some paraprofessionals. Others may require a contracted paraprofessional to pass an examination. Some require none of the above

A paraprofessional certificate is typically a certificate that an educator has obtained by passing an exam enabling them to perform a task requiring extensive knowledge, but not requiring a college degree and teaching license. Subject areas could include any areas of education such as a GED Teacher, Alternate School Teacher, ISS Teacher, After School Tutor, Home School Teacher, Credit Recovery Teacher, Continuing Education Teacher, and any Special Education area which could be but is not limited to CML, tutoring, and providing any needs to an individual student.

===Training===

The training of paraprofessional educators varies widely by state and district.  The Council for Exceptional Children (CEC) in collaboration with the National Paraeducator Resource Center (NPRC) has validated some guidelines for use in training paraeducators to serve "individuals with exceptionalities"  A link to these can be found here [http://www.cec.sped.org/Standards/Paraeducator-Preparation-Guidelines [link&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt;].   Professional development companies, such as 321insight.com and PD360 provide targeted training to enhance paraeducator competency.

===Salaries===
According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics' records of Occupational Employment Statistics, teacher assistants earn an average salary of $25,270. Teacher assistants in Elementary and Secondary Education make an average of $25,490, while teacher assistants working at Child Day Care services earn less and teacher assistants working in higher education earn more. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bls.gov/oes/current/oes259041.htm Teacher Assistants.] Bureau of Labor Statistics.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Special education==
Paraprofessional educators are frequently used to help support student/s in [[special education]] settings.  Paraprofessional educators in these roles work with students with a variety of disabilities including learning disabilities, emotional disturbance, [[autism]] spectrum disorders, [[ADHD]], [[schizophrenia]], developmental disabilities, and communication disorders. Paraprofessional educators may work in special classrooms, resource rooms or serve as inclusion assistants who accompany individual students throughout their day. Paraprofessional educators in these roles may require specialized training in behavior management, de-escalation, personal-[[professional boundaries]], and sometimes physical restraint.&lt;ref&gt;5.

A '''party political broadcast''' (also known, in pre-election campaigning periods, as a '''party election broadcast''') is a television or radio [[Broadcasting|broadcast]] made by a political party.

In the United Kingdom the [[Communications Act 2003]] prohibits [[political advertising]] on television or radio; parties are instead allocated broadcast slots (usually around five minutes long) free of charge on broadcast channels using a formula set by Parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cap.org.uk/Advertising-Codes/Broadcast/CodeItem.aspx?cscid={85344a94-8673-4fbf-9890-195a4ac1a093}#.WCOa9XV970o|title=07 Political and controversial matters|work= [[BCAP code]]|publisher=[[Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice]] (BCAP)|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cap.org.uk/Advertising-Codes/Broadcast/CodeItem.aspx?cscid={9bbcc79f-2faa-4e64-b14b-39c1b3cd263b}#.WCOaiXV970o|title=10 Prohibited categories|work= BCAP code|publisher=Broadcast Committee of Advertising Practice (BCAP)|accessdate=6 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar format exists in the [[Republic of Ireland]], though for smaller parties, because a greater number of them are represented in the [[Dáil Éireann|Dáil]], their allocated time may be as little as one or two minutes each.

In [[Canada]], the [[Canada Elections Act]] includes provisions for free-time election broadcasts (in addition to paid advertising) during Canadian federal elections, on all licensed terrestrial television and radio networks; notably, however, none of Canada's main English-language private television networks ([[CTV Television Network|CTV]], [[Global Television Network|Global]] and [[City (TV network)|City]]) actually operates under a network license anymore, meaning that in actual practice in the 2010s this provision applies only to [[CBC Television]] and the French-language networks in [[Quebec]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elections.ca/content.aspx?section=abo&amp;dir=bra/fre&amp;document=index&amp;lang=e "Allocation of Free Broadcasting Time"]. [[Elections Canada]].&lt;/ref&gt; CBC Television formerly broadcast the regular weekly series ''[[The Nation's Business]]'', in which Members of Parliament from all parties could give a short speech on a political issue, but this series no longer airs. 

In Asia, party political broadcasts have existed in [[Singapore]] since 1980, where they are known as ''political party broadcasts''. In Japan, party political broadcasts are known as {{nihongo|政見放送|''seiken hōsō''}}. In Brazil, party political broadcasts are known as ''Horário político''. In Chile, party political broadcasts are known as ''Franja Electoral''.

Vegetative semiosis is a type of sign processes that occurs at cellular and tissue level, including cellular recognition, [[plant perception (physiology)|plant perception]], plant [[signal transduction]], intercellular communication, immunological processes, etc.

The term 'phytosemiotics' has been introduced by [[Martin Krampen]] in 1981.

&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;'''Process performance qualification protocol''' is a component of [[process validation]]: [[process qualification]]. This step is vital in maintaining ongoing production quality by recording and having available for review essential conditions, &lt;u&gt;controls, testing, and expected manufacturing outcome&lt;/u&gt; of a production process. The [[Food and Drug Administration]] recommends the following criteria be included in a PPQ protocol:&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title=Guidance for Industry Process Validation: General Principles and Practices|url=http://www.fda.gov/downloads/Drugs/Guidances/UCM070336.pdf|publisher=Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*A sampling plan to outline sampling methods both during and between production batches
*Analysis methodology that allows for data scientific and risk oriented decision making based on statistical data. Variability limits should be defined and contingencies in the event of non-conforming data established
*Approval of PPQ protocol from relevant departments
Deviations from the standard operation procedures should be made within the framework of the protocol and at the approval of relevant [[quality control]] departments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Process Performance Qualification|url=http://www.atris-systems.com/222.0.html|publisher=Atris Information Systems|accessdate=16 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The protocol should cover all aspects of production including: equipment, personnel, raw materials, and operating environment. The FDA further recommends a documentation of the protocol be published internally. The report should include:
*A summation of relevant data and analysis from the protocol
*An explanation of unexpected data and any other results not mandated by the protocol and its effects on production quality
*Identify correlating effects and suggest changes to existing processes
*Conclude if the process performance is adequately qualified to meet performance standards. Should production standards not be met appropriate changes should be outlined

[[File:Bützflethermoor Rotschlammdeponie Luftaufnahmen 2012-05-by-RaBoe-478-1.jpg|thumb|Red mud near [[Stade]] ([[Germany]])]]
[[File:Bauxite bedarieux herault.jpg|thumb|[[Bauxite]], an aluminum ore ([[Hérault]] department, [[France]]). The reddish color is  due to [[iron oxides]] that make up the main part of the red mud.]]

'''Red mud''', also known as '''[[bauxite tailings]]''', '''red sludge''', bauxite residue, or alumina refinery residues (ARR), is a highly alkaline [[waste]] product composed mainly of iron oxide that is generated in the industrial production of [[alumina]] (aluminium oxide, the principal raw material used in the manufacture of [[aluminium]] metal and also widely used in the manufacture of ceramics, abrasives and refractories). Annually, about 77 million tons of the red [[hazardous material|special waste]] are produced, causing serious disposal problem in the [[mining]] industry.&lt;ref name="Ayr"&gt;Ayres, R. U., Holmberg, J., Andersson, B., "Materials and the global environment: Waste mining in the 21st century", MRS Bull. 2001, 26, 477.  {{DOI|10.1557/mrs2001.119}}&lt;/ref&gt; The scale of production makes the waste product an important one, and issues with its storage are reviewed and every opportunity is explored to find uses for it.  

Over 95% of the alumina produced globally is through the [[Bayer process]]; for every tonne of alumina produced, approximately 1 to 1.5 tonnes of bauxite tailings/residue are also produced.  Annual production of alumina in 2015 was approximately 115 million tonnes resulting in the generation of about 150 million tonnes of bauxite tailings/residue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.world-aluminium.org/statistics/alumina-production/ Annual statistics collected and published by World Aluminium].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Production==
Red mud is a side-product of the [[Bayer process]], the principal means of refining [[bauxite]] en route to [[alumina]]. The resulting alumina is the raw material for producing [[aluminium]] by the [[Hall–Héroult process]].&lt;ref name="hand"&gt;{{cite book | chapter-url = https://books.google.com/books?id=WvT2OEf8DskC&amp;pg=PA18 | pages = 18 | chapter = Red Mud Disposal | title = Handbook of aluminium recycling | isbn = 978-3-8027-2936-2 | author1 = Schmitz, Christoph | year = 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; A typical bauxite plant produces one to two times as much red mud as alumina. This ratio is dependent on the type of bauxite used in the refining process and the extraction conditions.&lt;ref name="waste" /&gt;

Red mud is composed of a mixture of solid and [[metal]]lic oxides. The [[red]] colour arises from [[iron oxide]]s, which comprise up to 60% of the mass. The mud is highly [[base (chemistry)|basic]] with a [[pH]] ranging from 10 to 13.&lt;ref name="hand"/&gt;&lt;ref name="waste"/&gt;&lt;ref name="indust"/&gt; In addition to iron, the other dominant components include [[silica]], unleached residual alumina, and [[titanium oxide]].&lt;ref name=Ayr/&gt;

There are over 60 manufacturing operations across the world using the [[Bayer process]] to make [[alumina]] from [[bauxite]] ore.  Bauxite ore is mined, normally in open cast mines, and transferred to an alumina refinery for processing.  To extract the alumina, the soluble part of the bauxite ore is dissolved using sodium hydroxide under conditions of high temperature and pressure.  The insoluble part of the bauxite (the residue) is removed, giving rise to a solution of [[sodium aluminate]], which is then seeded and allowed to cool and [[aluminium hydroxide]] precipitates from the solution. Though some of the aluminium hydroxide is then returned and used to seed the next batch, the remainder is calcined (heated) at over 1000&amp;nbsp;°C in rotary kilns or fluid flash calciners to produce aluminium oxide (alumina). The alumina content of the bauxite used is normally about 50% but ores with a much wider range of alumina contents can be used; the aluminium compound may be present as [[gibbsite]] (Al(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;), [[boehmite]] (AlOOH) or [[diaspore]] (AlOOH).  The tailings/residue invariably has a high concentration of [[iron oxide]] which gives the product a characteristic red colour.  A small residual amount of the sodium hydroxide used in the process remains with the tailings, causing the material to have a high pH/alkalinity, normally &gt;12. Various stages in the solid/liquid separation process are introduced to recycle as much sodium hydroxide as possible from the residue back into the Bayer Process in order to make the process as efficient as possible and reduce production costs. This also lowers the final alkalinity of the tailings making it easier to handle.

==Composition==
The main constituents of the residue after the extraction of the aluminium component are unreacted metallic oxides. The percentage of these oxides produced by a particular alumina refinery will depend on the quality and nature of the bauxite ore and the extraction conditions. The table below shows the composition ranges for common chemical constituents, but the values vary widely:

The objective is to remove as much of the aluminium containing component as economically possible. In general, the composition of the residue reflects that of the non-aluminium components, with the exception of part of the silicon component: crystalline silica (quartz) will not react but some of the silica present, often termed, reactive silica, will react under the extraction conditions and form sodium aluminium silicate.

=== Environmental hazards ===
Discharge of red mud is hazardous environmentally because of its [[alkalinity]].

In October 2010, approximately one million cubic meters of red mud from an [[alumina]] plant near [[Kolontár]] in [[Hungary]] was accidentally released into the surrounding countryside in the [[Ajka alumina plant accident]], killing ten people and contaminating a large area.&lt;ref name=npr100510&gt;[https://www.npr.org/blogs/thetwo-way/2010/10/05/130351938/red-sludge-from-hungarian-aluminum-plant-spill-an-ecological-disaster "Toxic Red Sludge Spill From Hungarian Aluminum Plant 'An Ecological Disaster'"], David Gura, NPR, October 5, 2010&lt;/ref&gt; All life in the [[Marcal]] river was said to have been "extinguished" by the red mud, and within days the mud had reached the [[Danube]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Hungarian chemical sludge spill reaches Danube | url = https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-11491412| newspaper = BBC| date = 7 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Residue storage areas (RSA)==
Tailings storage methods have changed substantially since the original plants were built. The practice in early years was to pump the tailings slurry, at a concentration of about 20% solids, into lagoons or ponds sometimes created in former bauxite mines or depleted quarries. In other cases, impoundments were constructed with dams or [[levee]]s, whilst for some operations valleys were dammed and the tailings deposited in these holding areas.&lt;ref&gt;K. Evans, E. Nordheim and K. Tsesmelis, "Bauxite Residue Management", Light Metals, 63–66 (2012).&lt;/ref&gt;

It was also common practice for the tailings to be discharged into rivers, estuaries, or the sea via pipelines or barges; in other instances the residue was shipped out to sea and disposed of in deep ocean trenches many kilometres offshore. All disposal in the sea, estuaries and rivers has now stopped.&lt;ref&gt;G. Power, M. Graefe and C. Klauber, "Bauxite residue issues: Current Management, Disposal and Storage Practices", Hydrometallurgy, 108, 33–45 (2011).&lt;/ref&gt; As residue storage space ran out and concern increased over wet storage, since the mid-1980s dry stacking has been increasingly adopted.&lt;ref&gt;B. G. Purnell, “Mud Disposal at the Burntisland Alumina Plant”. Light Metals, 157–159. (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;H. H. Pohland and A. J. Tielens, “Design and Operation on Non-decanted Red Mud Ponds in Ludwigshafen”, Proc. Int. Conf. Bauxite Tailings, Kingston, Jamaica (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;E. I. Robinsky, “Current Status of the Sloped Thickened Tailings Disposal System”, Proc. Int. Conf. Bauxite Tailings, Kingston, Jamaica (1986).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;J. L. Chandler, “The Stacking and Solar Drying Process for disposal of bauxite tailings in Jamaica”, Proc. Int. Conf. Bauxite Tailings, Kingston, Jamaica (1986).&lt;/ref&gt; In this method, tailings are thickened to a high density slurry (48-55% solids or higher), and then deposited in a way that it consolidates and dries.&lt;ref&gt;“Bauxite Residue Management: Best Practice”, published by World Aluminium the European Aluminium available from the International Aluminium Institute, 10 King Charles II Street, London, SW1Y 4AA, UK and on line from http://bauxite.world-aluminium.org/refining/bauxite-residue-management.html.&lt;/ref&gt;

An increasing popular storage method is filtration whereby a filter cake (typically &lt;30% solids) is produced. This cake can be washed with either water or steam to reduce alkalinity before being transported and stored as a semi-dried material.&lt;ref&gt;K. S. Sutherland, "Solid/Liquid Separation Equipment", Wiley-VCH, Weinheim (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;  Residue produced in this form is ideal for reuse as it has lower alkalinity, is cheaper to transport, and is easier to handle and process.

==Use==

Since the [[Bayer process]] was first adopted industrially in 1894, the value of the remaining oxides has been recognised. Attempts have been made to recover the principal components – especially iron. Since mining began, an enormous amount of research effort has been devoted to seeking uses for the residue. 

Many studies have been conducted to develop uses of red mud.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kumar|first=Sanjay|last2=Kumar|first2=Rakesh|last3=Bandopadhyay|first3=Amitava|date=2006-10-01|title=Innovative methodologies for the utilisation of wastes from metallurgical and allied industries|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0921344906000401|journal=Resources, Conservation and Recycling|volume=48|issue=4|pages=301–314|doi=10.1016/j.resconrec.2006.03.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; An estimated 2 to 3 million tonnes are used annually in the production of cement,&lt;ref&gt;Y.

Vedanta Aluminium Ltd has commissioned a red mud powder-producing unit at Lanjigarh refinery in [[Odisha]], [[India]], describing it as first of its kind in alumina industry tackling major environmental hazards.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | title = Vedanta commissions red mud powder plant in Odisha | url = http://www.thehindubusinessline.com/companies/vedanta-commissions-red-mud-power-plant-in-odisha/article5367292.ece | newspaper = Business Line| date = 19 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2015 a major initiative was launched in Europe with funds from the European Union to address the [[valorisation]] of bauxite residue. Some 15 Ph.D students have been recruited as part the European Training Network for Zero-Waste Valorisation of Bauxite Residue.&lt;ref&gt;http://etn.redmud.org/project/&lt;/ref&gt; The key focus will be the recovery of iron, aluminium, titanium and rare-earth elements (including [[scandium]]) while valorising the residue into building materials.

'''Space Power Facility''' ('''SPF''') is a [[NASA]] facility used to test spaceflight hardware under simulated launch and spaceflight conditions. The SPF is part of NASA's Plum Brook Station, which in turn is part of the [[Glenn Research Center]]. The Plum Brook Station and the SPF are located near [[Sandusky, Ohio]] ([[Oxford Township, Erie County, Ohio]]).

The SPF is able to simulate a spacecraft's launch environment, as well as in-space environments. NASA has developed these capabilities under one roof to optimize testing of spaceflight hardware while minimizing transportation issues. Space Power Facility has become a "One Stop Shop" to qualify flight hardware for manned space flight. This facility provides the capability to perform the following environmental testing:
* Thermal-vacuum testing
* Reverberation acoustic testing
* Mechanical vibration testing
* Modal testing
* Electromagnetic interference and compatibility testing

==Thermal-Vacuum Test Chamber==
The '''Space Power Facility''' ('''SPF''') is a [[vacuum chamber]] built by [[NASA]] in 1969. It stands {{convert|122|ft|m}} high and {{convert|100|ft|m}} in diameter, enclosing a [[bullet]]-shaped space. It is the world's largest thermal vacuum chamber. It was originally commissioned for nuclear-electric power studies under vacuum conditions, but was later decommissioned. Recently, it was recommissioned for use in testing [[spacecraft propulsion]] systems. Recent uses include testing the airbag landing systems for the [[Mars Pathfinder]] and the [[Mars Exploration Rover]]s, Spirit and Opportunity, under simulated Mars atmospheric conditions.

The facility was designed and constructed to test both nuclear and non-nuclear space hardware in a simulated Low-Earth-Orbiting environment. Although the facility was designed for testing nuclear hardware, only non-nuclear tests have been performed throughout its history. Some of the test programs that have been performed at the facility include high-energy experiments, rocket-fairing separation tests, Mars Lander system tests, deployable Solar Sail tests and International Space Station hardware tests. The SPF is located at the NASA Glenn Research Center at the Plum Brook site.

The facility can sustain a high vacuum (10&lt;sup&gt;−6&lt;/sup&gt; [[torr]], 130 μPa); simulate solar radiation via a 4&amp;nbsp;MW quartz heat lamp array, solar spectrum by a 400&amp;nbsp;kW arc lamp, and cold environments ({{convert|-320|F|C}}) with a variable geometry cryogenic cold shroud.

The facility is available on a full-cost reimbursable basis to government, universities, and the private sector.

In Spring 2013 [[SpaceX]] conducted a [[Payload fairing|fairing]] separation test in the vacuum chamber.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LtI1V624vWM SpaceX Fairing Separation in the SPF Vacuum Chamber] - YouTube.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aluminum Test Chamber===
The Aluminum Test Chamber is a vacuum-tight aluminum plate vessel that is {{convert|100|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|122|ft|m}} high. Designed for an external pressure of {{convert|2.5|psi|kPa|abbr=on}} and internal pressure of {{convert|5|psi|kPa|abbr=on}}, the chamber is constructed of Type 5083 aluminum which is a clad on the interior surface with a {{convert|1/8|in|mm|abbr=on}} thick type 3003 aluminum for corrosion resistance. This material was selected because of its low neutron absorption cross-section. The floor plate and vertical shell are {{convert|1|in|mm}} (total) thick, while the dome shell is {{convert|1+3/8|in|mm|abbr=on}}. Welded circumferentially to the exterior surface is aluminum structural T-section members that are {{convert|3|ft|m|1}} deep and {{convert|2|ft|m|1}} wide. The doors of the test chamber are {{convert|50|by|50|ft|m}} in size and have double door seals to prevent leakage. The chamber floor was designed for a load of 300 tons.

===Concrete Chamber Enclosure===
The concrete chamber enclosure serves not only as a radiological shield but also as a primary vacuum barrier from atmospheric pressure. {{convert|130|ft|m}} in diameter and {{convert|150|ft|m}} in height, the chamber was designed to withstand atmospheric pressure outside of the chamber at the same time vacuum conditions are occurring within. The concrete thickness varies from {{convert|6|to|8|ft|m}} and contains a leak-tight steel containment barrier embedded within. The chamber's doors are {{convert|50|by|50|ft|m}} and have inflatable seals. The space between the concrete enclosure and the aluminum test chamber is pumped down to a pressure of {{convert|20|torr|kPa}} during a test.

===Electromagnetic Interference/Compatibility (EMI/EMC) functionality===
Designed specifically as a large-scale thermal-vacuum test chamber for qualification testing of vehicles and equipment in outer-space conditions, it was discovered in the late 2000s that the unique construction of the SPF interior aluminum vacuum chamber also makes it an extremely large and electrically complex RF cavity with excellent reverberant RF characteristics. In 2009 these characteristics were measured by NIST and others&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/details/electromagnetice1558koep NIST TN-1558 - An electromagnetic evaluation of the NASA space power facility at Plum Brook Station by Koepke, Galen H.; Ladbury, John; Camell, Dennis; Coder, Jason; Hammerschmidt, Chriss; Direeen, Randall; Guerrieri, Jeff.]&lt;/ref&gt; after which the facility was understood to be, not only the world's largest Vacuum chamber, but also the world's largest EMI/EMC test facility. In 2011 NASA GRC successfully performed a calibration of the aluminum vacuum chamber&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp?R=20150000254 NASA TM—2014-218363 - Space Power Facility Reverberation Chamber Calibration Report]&lt;/ref&gt; using IEC 61000-4-21 methodologies.&lt;ref&gt;[https://webstore.iec.ch/publication/4191 IEC 61000-4-21:2011 - Electromagnetic compatibility (EMC) - Part 4-21: Testing and measurement techniques - Reverberation chamber test methods]&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of these activities, the SPF is capable of performing radiated susceptibility EMI tests for vehicles and equipment per [[MIL-STD-461]] and able to achieve MIL-STD-461F limits above approximately 80&amp;nbsp;MHz. In the spring of 2017 the low-power characterizations and calibrations from 2009 and 2011 were proven correct in a series of high-power tests performed in the chamber to validate its capabilities. The SPF chamber is currently being prepared for EMI radiated susceptibility testing of the crew module for the [[Exploration Mission 1]] of NASA's [[Orion (spacecraft)]].

==Mechanical Vibration Test Facility==
[[File:Mechanical Vibration Facility.jpg|thumb|left|NASA's MVF Mechanical Vibration Facility]]
The Mechanical Vibration Test Facility (MVF), is a three-axis vibration system. It will apply vibration in each of the three orthogonal axes (not simultaneously) with one direction in parallel to the Earth-launch thrust axis (X) at 5–150&amp;nbsp;Hz, 0-1.25 g-pk vertical, and 5–150&amp;nbsp;Hz 0-1.0 g-pk for the horizontal axes. 
Vertical, or the thrust axis, shaking is accomplished by using 16 vertical actuators manufactured by TEAM Corporation, each capable of {{convert|30000|lbf|kN|abbr=on}}. The 16 vertical actuators allow for testing of up to a {{convert|75000|lb|kg|abbr=on}} article at the previously stated frequency and amplitude limits.
Horizontal shaking is accomplished through use of 4 TEAM Corporation Horizontal Actuators. The horizontal actuators are used during Vertical testing to counteract cross axis forces and overturning moments.

==Modal Test Facility==

In addition to the sine vibe table, a fixed-base Modal floor sufficient for the {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} diameter test article is available. The fixed based Modal Test Facility is a {{convert|6|in|mm|abbr=on}} thick steel floor on top of {{convert|19|ft|m|abbr=on}} of concrete, that is tied to the earth using {{convert|50|ft|m|abbr=on}} deep tensioned rock anchors.

There were over {{convert|21000000|lb|MT}} of rock anchors, and {{convert|6000000|lb|MT}} of concrete used in the construction of the fixed-base modal test facility and mechanical vibration test facility.

==Assembly Area==
The SPF Facility layout is ideal for performing multiple test programs. The facility has two large high bay areas adjacent to either side of the vacuum chamber. The advantage of having both areas available is that it allows for two complex tests to be prepared simultaneously. One test can be prepared in a high bay while another test is being conducted in the vacuum chamber. Large chamber doors provide access to the test chamber from either high bay.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18625">'''Statistical machine translation''' ('''SMT''') is a [[machine translation]] [[paradigm]] where translations are generated on the basis of [[statistical model]]s whose parameters are derived from the analysis of bilingual [[text corpora]].  The statistical approach contrasts with the [[Rule-based machine translation|rule-based approaches to machine translation]] as well as with [[example-based machine translation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Philipp Koehn |date=2009 |title=Statistical Machine Translation |url=http://www.statmt.org/book/ |location= |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=27 |quote=Statistical machine translation is related to other data-driven methods in machine translation, such as the earlier work on example-based machine translation. Contrast this to systems that are based on hand-crafted rules. |isbn=0521874157 |access-date= 22 March 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first ideas of statistical machine translation were introduced by [[Warren Weaver]] in 1949,&lt;ref&gt;W. Weaver (1955). Translation (1949). In: ''Machine Translation of Languages'', MIT Press, Cambridge, MA.&lt;/ref&gt; including the ideas of applying [[Claude Shannon]]'s [[information theory]]. Statistical machine translation was re-introduced in the late 1980s and early 1990s by researchers at [[IBM]]'s [[Thomas J. Watson Research Center]]&lt;ref name=brown88&gt;{{cite journal |last=P.

Nowadays it is by far the most widely studied machine translation method.

==Basis==

The idea behind statistical machine translation comes from [[information theory]]. A document is translated according to the [[probability distribution]] &lt;math&gt;p(e|f)&lt;/math&gt; that a string &lt;math&gt;e&lt;/math&gt; in the target language (for example, English) is the translation of a string &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt; in the source language (for example, French).

The problem of modeling the probability distribution &lt;math&gt;p(e|f)&lt;/math&gt; has been approached in a number of ways.  One approach which lends itself well to computer implementation is to apply [[Bayes Theorem]], that is &lt;math&gt;p(e|f) \propto p(f|e) p(e)&lt;/math&gt;, where the translation model &lt;math&gt;p(f|e)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that the source string is the translation of the target string, and the [[language model]] &lt;math&gt;p(e)&lt;/math&gt; is the probability of seeing that target language string. This decomposition is attractive as it splits the problem into two subproblems. Finding the best translation &lt;math&gt;\tilde{e}&lt;/math&gt; is done by picking up the one that gives the highest probability:
:&lt;math&gt; \tilde{e} = arg \max_{e \in e^*} p(e|f) = arg \max_{e\in e^*} p(f|e) p(e) &lt;/math&gt;.

For a rigorous implementation of this one would have to perform an exhaustive search by going through all strings &lt;math&gt;e^*&lt;/math&gt; in the native language. Performing the search efficiently is the work of a [[Beam_search#Uses|machine translation decoder]] that uses the foreign string, heuristics and other methods to limit the search space and at the same time keeping acceptable quality. This trade-off between quality and time usage can also be found in [[speech recognition]].

As the translation systems are not able to store all native strings and their translations, a document is typically translated sentence by sentence, but even this is not enough. Language models are typically approximated by [[N-gram#Smoothing techniques|smoothed ''n''-gram model]]s, and similar approaches have been applied to translation models, but there is additional complexity due to different sentence lengths and word orders in the languages.

The statistical translation models were initially [[word]] based (Models 1-5 from [[IBM]] [[Hidden Markov model]] from Stephan Vogel&lt;ref&gt;S. Vogel, H. Ney and C. Tillmann. 1996. [https://aclanthology.info/pdf/C/C96/C96-2141.pdf HMM-based Word Alignment in Statistical Translation]. In COLING ’96: The 16th International Conference on Computational Linguistics, pp. 836-841, Copenhagen, Denmark.&lt;/ref&gt; and Model 6 from Franz-Joseph Och&lt;ref name="H. Ney. 2003"&gt;F. Och and H. Ney. (2003). [https://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/pdfplus/10.1162/089120103321337421 A Systematic Comparison of Various Statistical Alignment Models]. Computational Linguistics, 29(1):19-51&lt;/ref&gt;), but significant advances were made with the introduction of [[phrase]] based models.&lt;ref&gt;P. Koehn, F.J. Och, and D. Marcu (2003). [https://aclanthology.info/pdf/N/N03/N03-1017.pdf Statistical phrase based translation]. In ''Proceedings of the Joint Conference on Human Language Technologies and the Annual Meeting of the North American Chapter of the Association of Computational Linguistics (HLT/NAACL)''.&lt;/ref&gt;  Recent work has incorporated [[syntax]] or quasi-syntactic structures.&lt;ref name="Chiang2005"&gt;D. Chiang (2005). [https://aclanthology.info/pdf/P/P05/P05-1033.pdf A Hierarchical Phrase-Based Model for Statistical Machine Translation]. In ''Proceedings of the 43rd Annual Meeting of the Association for Computational Linguistics (ACL'05)''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Benefits==

The most frequently cited{{Citation needed|date=October 2015}} benefits of statistical machine translation over rule-based approach are:

* More efficient use of human and data resources
**There are many parallel corpora in machine-readable format and even more monolingual data.
**Generally, SMT systems are not tailored to any specific pair of languages.
**Rule-based translation systems require the manual development of linguistic rules, which can be costly, and which often do not generalize to other languages.
* More fluent translations owing to use of a language model

==Shortcomings==

* Corpus creation can be costly.
* Specific errors are hard to predict and fix.
* Results may have superficial fluency that masks translation problems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Zhou |first=Sharon |date=July 25, 2018 |title=Has AI surpassed humans at translation? Not even close! |url=https://www.skynettoday.com/editorials/state_of_nmt |magazine=Skynet Today |access-date=2 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Statistical machine translation usually works less well for language pairs with significantly different word order.
* The benefits obtained for translation between Western European languages are not representative of results for other language pairs, owing to smaller training corpora and greater grammatical differences.

==Word-based translation==

In word-based translation, the fundamental unit of translation is a word in some natural language. Typically, the number of words in translated sentences are different, because of compound words, morphology and idioms. The ratio of the lengths of sequences of translated words is called fertility, which tells how many foreign words each native word produces. Necessarily it is assumed by information theory that each covers the same concept. In practice this is not really true. For example, the English word ''corner'' can be translated in Spanish by either ''rincón'' or ''esquina'', depending on whether it is to mean its internal or external angle.

Simple word-based translation can't translate between languages with different fertility. Word-based translation systems can relatively simply be made to cope with high fertility, but they could map a single word to multiple words, but not the other way about{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. For example, if we were translating from English to French, each word in English could produce any number of French words&amp;mdash; sometimes none at all. But there's no way to group two English words producing a single French word.

An example of a word-based translation system is the freely available [[GIZA++]] package ([[GPL]]ed), which includes the training program for [[IBM]] models and HMM model and Model 6.&lt;ref name="H. Ney. 2003"/&gt;

The word-based translation is not widely used today; phrase-based systems are more common. Most phrase-based system are still using GIZA++ to align the corpus{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}}. The alignments are used to extract phrases or deduce syntax rules.&lt;ref&gt;P. Koehn, H. Hoang, A. Birch, C. Callison-Burch, M. Federico, N. Bertoldi, B. Cowan, W. Shen, C. Moran, R. Zens, C. Dyer, O. Bojar, A. Constantin, E. Herbst. 2007. [https://aclanthology.info/pdf/P/P07/P07-2045.pdf Moses: Open Source Toolkit for Statistical Machine Translation]. ACL 2007, Demonstration Session, Prague, Czech Republic&lt;/ref&gt; And matching words in bi-text is still a problem actively discussed in the community. Because of the predominance of GIZA++, there are now several distributed implementations of it online.&lt;ref&gt;Q. Gao, S. Vogel, "[http://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W08-0509 Parallel Implementations of Word Alignment Tool]", Software Engineering, Testing, and Quality Assurance for Natural Language Processing, pp. 49-57, June, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phrase-based translation==

In phrase-based translation, the aim is to reduce the restrictions of word-based translation by translating whole sequences of words, where the lengths may differ. The sequences of words are called blocks or phrases, but typically are not linguistic [[phrase]]s, but [[phraseme]]s found using statistical methods from corpora. It has been shown that restricting the phrases to linguistic phrases (syntactically motivated groups of words, see [[syntactic categories]]) decreases the quality of translation.&lt;ref&gt;Philipp Koehn, Franz Josef Och, Daniel Marcu: [https://aclanthology.info/pdf/N/N03/N03-1017.pdf Statistical Phrase-Based Translation] (2003)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syntax-based translation==

Syntax-based translation is based on the idea of translating [[syntax (linguistics)|syntactic]] units, rather than single words or strings of words (as in phrase-based MT), i.e. (partial) [[parse tree]]s of sentences/utterances. The idea of syntax-based translation is quite old in MT, though its statistical counterpart did not take off until the advent of strong [[stochastic parsing|stochastic parsers]] in the 1990s. Examples of this approach include [[Data-oriented parsing|DOP]]-based MT and, more recently, [[synchronous context-free grammar]]s.

==Hierarchical phrase-based translation==
Hierarchical phrase-based translation combines the strengths of phrase-based and syntax-based translation. It uses [[synchronous context-free grammar]] rules, but the grammars may be constructed by an extension of methods for phrase-based translation without reference to linguistically motivated syntactic constituents. This idea was first introduced in Chiang's Hiero system (2005).&lt;ref name="Chiang2005" /&gt;

==Challenges with statistical machine translation==
{{Expand section|date=May 2012}}

Problems that statistical machine translation have to deal with include:

=== Sentence alignment ===
In parallel corpora single sentences in one language can be found translated into several sentences in the other and vice versa. Sentence aligning can be performed through the [[Gale-Church alignment algorithm]].

=== Word Alignment ===
Sentence alignment is usually either provided by the corpus or obtained by aforementioned [[Gale-Church alignment algorithm]]. To learn e.g. the translation model, however, we need to know which words align in a source-target sentence pair. Solutions are the [[IBM alignment models|IBM-Models]] or the [[Word alignment#HMM|HMM-approach.]]

=== Statistical anomalies ===
Real-world training sets may override translations of, say, proper nouns.  An example would be that "I took the train to Berlin" gets mis-translated as "I took the train to Paris" due to an abundance of "train to Paris" in the training set

=== Idioms ===

Depending on the corpora used, idioms may not translate "idiomatically". For example, using Canadian Hansard as the bilingual corpus, "hear" may almost invariably be translated to "Bravo!" since in Parliament "Hear, Hear!" becomes "Bravo!".
&lt;ref&gt;W. J. Hutchins and H. Somers. (1992). ''An Introduction to Machine Translation'', 18.3:322. {{ISBN|978-0-12-362830-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Different word orders ===

Word order in languages differ. Some classification can be done by naming the typical order of subject (S), verb (V) and object (O) in a sentence and one can talk, for instance, of SVO or VSO languages. There are also additional differences in word orders, for instance, where modifiers for nouns are located, or where the same words are used as a question or a statement.

In [[speech recognition]], the speech signal and the corresponding textual representation can be mapped to each other in blocks in order. This is not always the case with the same text in two languages. For SMT, the machine translator can only manage small sequences of words, and word order has to be thought of by the program designer. Attempts at solutions have included re-ordering models, where a distribution of location changes for each item of translation is guessed from aligned bi-text. Different location changes can be ranked with the help of the language model and the best can be selected.

Recently, [[Skype]] voice communicator started testing speech translation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skype.com/en/translator-preview/ Skype Translator Preview]&lt;/ref&gt; However, machine translation is following technological trends in speech at a slower rate than speech recognition. In fact, some ideas from speech recognition research have been adopted by statistical machine translation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wołk | first1 = K. | last2 = Marasek | first2 = K. | title = Real-Time Statistical Speech Translation | url = | journal = Advances in Intelligent Systems and Computing | publisher = Springer | volume = 275 | pages = 107–114 | issn = 2194-5357 | isbn = 978-3-319-05950-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Out of vocabulary (OOV) words ===

SMT systems typically store different word forms as separate symbols without any relation to each other and word forms 
or phrases that were not in the training data cannot be translated. This might be because of the lack of training data, changes in the human domain where the system is used, or differences in morphology.

=== Mobile devices ===

The rapid increase in the computing power of [[Tablet computer|tablets]] and [[smartphone]]s, combined with the wide availability of high-speed [[mobile broadband|mobile Internet access]], makes it possible for them to run machine translation systems. Experimental systems have already been developed to assist foreign health workers in developing countries. Similar systems are already available on the market. For example, [[Apple Inc.|Apple]]’s [[iOS 8]] allows users to dictate [[text messaging|text messages]]. A built-in [[speech recognition|ASR]] system recognizes the speech and the recognition results are edited by an online system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |author1=Wołk K. |author2=Marasek K. | year = 2014 | title = Polish-English Speech Statistical Machine Translation Systems for the IWSLT 2014 | conference = Proceedings of the 11th International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, Lake Tahoe, USA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Projects such as Universal Speech Translation Advanced Research (U-STAR1, a continuation of the A-STAR project) and EU-BRIDGE2 are currently conducting research in translation of full sentences recognized from spoken language. Recent years have seen a growing interest in combining speech recognition, machine translation and [[speech synthesis]]. To achieve [[speech translation|speech-to-speech translation]], n-best lists are passed from the ASR to the statistical machine translation system. However, combining those systems raises problems of how to achieve sentence segmentation, de-normalization and punctuation prediction needed for quality translations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite conference |author1=Wołk K. |author2=Marasek K. | year = 2013 | title = Polish-English Speech Statistical Machine Translation Systems for the IWSLT 2013 | pages = 113–119 | conference = Proceedings of the 10th International Workshop on Spoken Language Translation, Heidelberg, Germany |url=https://arxiv.org/pdf/1509.09097}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts''''', a book published in 2001, discusses the archaeology of [[Land of Israel | Israel]] and its relationship to the origins and content of the [[Hebrews|Hebrew]] [[Bible]]. The authors are [[Israel Finkelstein]], Professor of Archaeology at [[Tel Aviv University]], and [[Neil Asher Silberman]], an archaeologist,  historian and contributing editor to ''[[Archaeology Magazine]]''.

==Methodology==
The methodology applied by the authors is [[historical criticism]] with an emphasis on archaeology. Writing in the website of "The Bible and Interpretation", the authors describe their approach as one "in which the Bible is one of the most important artifacts and cultural achievements [but] not the unquestioned narrative framework into which every archaeological find must be fit." Their main contention is that:&lt;ref&gt;Finkelstein, I., Silberman, NA., The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts, ''The Bible and Interpretation'', [http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/Finkelstein_Silberman022001.shtml] Accessed 27 Sept 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{cquote|...an archaeological analysis of the [[Patriarchs (Bible)|patriarchal]], [[Book of Joshua|conquest]], [[Book of Judges|judges]], and [[United Monarchy]] narratives [shows] that while there is no compelling archaeological evidence for any of them, there is clear archaeological evidence that places the stories themselves in a late 7th-century BCE context.}}

On the basis of this evidence they propose
{{cquote|... an archaeological reconstruction of the distinct histories of the kingdoms of [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Israel]] and [[Kingdom of Judah|Judah]], highlighting the largely neglected history of the [[Omride Dynasty]] and attempting to show how the influence of [[Assyria]]n imperialism in the region set in motion a chain of events that would eventually make the poorer, more remote, and more religiously conservative kingdom of Judah the belated center of the cultic and national hopes of all Israel.}}

As noted by a reviewer on [[Salon.com]]&lt;ref name="Salon"&gt;{{cite web |title=King David was a nebbish |first=Laura |last=Miller |date=7 February 2001 |publisher=[[Salon.com]] |url=http://archive.salon.com/books/feature/2001/02/07/solomon/index.html |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010214416/http://archive.salon.com/books/feature/2001/02/07/solomon/index.html |archivedate=10 October 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; the approach and conclusions of ''The Bible Unearthed'' are not particularly new. [[Ze'ev Herzog]], professor of archaeology at [[Tel Aviv University]], wrote a cover story for ''[[Haaretz]]'' in 1999 in which he reached similar conclusions following the same methodology; Herzog noted also that some of these findings have been accepted by the majority of biblical scholars and archaeologists for years and even decades, even though they have only recently begun to make a dent in the awareness of the general public.&lt;ref name="Salon" /&gt;

==Content==
Early biblical archaeology was conducted with the presumption that the Bible must be true, finds only being considered as illustrations for the biblical narrative, and interpreting evidence to fit the Bible. Some archaeologists such as [[Eilat Mazar]] continue to take this "Bible and spade" approach, or, like the journal ''[[Bible and Spade]]'', attempt to treat archaeology as a tool for proving the Bible's accuracy,{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} but since the 1970s most archaeologists, such as prominent Egyptologist [[Kenneth Kitchen]],&lt;ref name='Kitchen'&gt;On the Reliability of the Old Testament, by Kenneth Kitchen&lt;/ref&gt;{{or|date=September 2014}} have begun instead to interpret the evidence only in the light of other archaeology, treating the Bible as an artifact to be examined, rather than as an unquestioned truth.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 22.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach has led to results both in favor and against the historicity of the old Testament.&lt;ref name='Kitchen' /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Bible Unearthed, Section "History or Not History" of the Introduction&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ancestors and anachronisms===
[[File:Egypt 1450 BC.svg|thumb|right|Egypt in the 15th century BC, the time of [[the Exodus]] and the conquest of Canaan as described in the [[Book of Joshua]] according to the Biblical chronology. As the map indicates, Canaan was occupied by Egypt at that time, a fact which the Bible fails to register.]]
''The Bible Unearthed'' begins by considering what it terms the 'preamble' of the Bible—the [[Book of Genesis]]—and its relationship to archaeological evidence for the context in which its narratives are set. Archaeological discoveries about society and culture in the ancient Near East lead the authors to point out a number of anachronisms, suggestive that the narratives were actually set down in the 9th–7th centuries:&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; 
*[[Aram (biblical region)|Aram]]aeans are frequently mentioned, but no ancient text mentions them until around 1100 BCE, and they only begin to dominate Israel's northern borders after the 9th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 39.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The text describes the early origin of the neighbouring kingdom of [[Edom]], but [[Assyria]]n records show that Edom only came into existence after the conquest of the region by Assyria; before then it was without functioning kings, was not a distinct state, and archaeological evidence shows that the territory was only sparsely populated.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 40.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Joseph (Hebrew Bible)|Joseph]] story refers to [[camel]]-based traders carrying ''[[natural gum|gum]], [[Balsam of Mecca|balm]], and [[myrrh]]'', which is unlikely prior to the first millennium, such activity only becoming common in the 8th–7th centuries BCE, when Assyrian [[hegemony]] enabled this Arabian trade to flourish into a major industry.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 37.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent excavations in the [[Timna Valley]] discovered what may be the earliest bones of domesticated camels found in Israel or even outside the Arabian peninsula, dating to around 930 BCE. This is seen as evidence that the stories of [[Abraham]], [[Joseph (son of Jacob)|Joseph]], [[Jacob]] and [[Esau]] were written after this time.&lt;ref name=camels&gt;{{cite news|last=Hasson|first=Nir|title=Hump stump solved: Camels arrived in region much later than biblical reference|url=http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/week-s-end/.premium-1.569091|accessdate=30 January 2014|newspaper=Haaretz|date=Jan 17, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sapir-Hen|first=Lidar|author2=Erez Ben-Yosef |title=The Introduction of Domestic Camels to the Southern Levant: Evidence from the Aravah Valley|journal=Tel Aviv|year=2013|volume=40|pages=277–285|url=http://archaeology.tau.ac.il/ben-yosef/pub/Pub_PDFs/Sapir-Hen&amp;Ben-Yosef13_CamelAravah_TelAviv.pdf|accessdate=16 February 2014|doi=10.1179/033443513x13753505864089}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[land of Goshen]] has a name that comes from an Arabic group who dominated the [[Nile Delta]] only in the 6th and 5th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 66–67.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Egyptian [[Pharaoh]] is portrayed as fearing invasion from the east, even though Egypt's territory stretched to the northern parts of [[Canaan]], with its main threat consequently being from the north, until the 7th century&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book comments that this corresponds with the [[documentary hypothesis]], in which [[textual criticism|textual scholarship]] argues for the majority of the [[pentateuch|first five biblical books]] being written between the 8th and 6th centuries.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; Although archaeological results, and Assyrian records, suggest that the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Kingdom of Israel]] was the greater of the two, it is the [[Kingdom of Judah]] which is afforded greater prominence by ''Genesis'', whose narratives concentrate on Abraham, [[Jerusalem]], [[Judah (Bible)|Judah]] (the patriarch), and [[Hebron]], more than on characters and places from the northern kingdom (Israel); ''the Bible Unearthed'' explains this pre-eminence of [[Yahwist]] text as an attempt to seize the opportunity, afforded by the destruction of Israel in 720 BCE, to portray the Israelites as a single people, with Judah having (always) had primacy.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 45.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origin of the Israelites===
The book remarks that, despite modern archaeological investigations and the meticulous ancient Egyptian records from the period of [[Ramesses II]], there is an obvious lack of any archaeological evidence for the migration of a band of semitic people across the [[Sinai Peninsula]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 62–63.&lt;/ref&gt; except for the [[Hyksos]]. Although the Hyksos are in some ways a good match, their main centre being at [[Avaris]] (later renamed 'Pi-Ramesses'), in the heart of the region corresponding to the 'land of Goshen', and [[Manetho]] later writing that the Hyksos eventually founded the [[Temple in Jerusalem]],&lt;ref name="p55"&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 55.&lt;/ref&gt; it throws up other problems, as the Hyksos became not slaves but rulers, and they were chased away rather than chased to bring them back.&lt;ref name="p55" /&gt; Nevertheless, the book posits that the exodus narrative perhaps evolved from vague memories of the Hyksos expulsion, spun to encourage resistance to the 7th century domination of Judah by Egypt.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Finkelstein and Silberman argue that instead of the Israelites conquering Canaan after the Exodus (as suggested by the [[book of Joshua]]), most of them had in fact always been there; the Israelites were simply Canaanites who developed into a distinct culture.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent surveys of long-term settlement patterns in the Israelite heartlands show no sign of violent invasion or even peaceful infiltration, but rather a sudden demographic transformation about 1200 BCE in which villages appear in the previously unpopulated highlands;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt; these settlements have a similar appearance to modern Bedouin camps, suggesting that the inhabitants were once pastoral nomads, driven to take up farming by the [[Bronze Age collapse|Late Bronze Age collapse]] of the Canaanite city-culture.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 111–113.&lt;/ref&gt;

The authors take issue with the [[book of Joshua]]'s depiction of the Israelites conquering Canaan in only a few years—far less than the lifetime of one individual—in which cities such as [[Hazor (archaeological site)|Hazor]], [[Ai (Bible)|Ai]], and [[Jericho]], are destroyed. Finkelstein and Silberman view this account as the result of the telescoping effect of the vagaries of folk memory about destruction caused by other events;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 91.&lt;/ref&gt; modern archaeological examination of these cities shows that their destruction spanned a period of many centuries, with Hazor being destroyed 100 to 300 years after Jericho,&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 81–82.&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=September 2014}} while Ai (whose name actually means 'the ruin') was completely abandoned for roughly a millennium "before the collapse of Late Bronze Canaan. ... Like Jericho, there was no settlement at the time of its supposed conquest by the children of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt;

===David and Solomon or the Omrides?===
Although the [[book of Samuel]], and initial parts of the [[books of Kings]], portray [[Saul]], [[David]] and [[Solomon]] ruling in succession over a powerful and cosmopolitan [[United Monarchy|united kingdom of Israel and Judah]], Finkelstein and Silberman regard modern archaeological evidence as showing that this may not be true. Archaeology instead shows that in the time of Solomon, the northern kingdom of Israel was quite small, too poor to be able to pay for a vast army, and with too little bureaucracy to be able to administer a kingdom, certainly not an empire;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 134.&lt;/ref&gt; it only emerged later, around the beginning of the 9th century BCE, in the time of [[Omri (King of Israel)|Omri]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 176.&lt;/ref&gt; There is little to suggest that [[Jerusalem]], called by the Bible David's capital, was "perhaps not more than a typical hill country village" during the time of David and of Solomon,&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 133.&lt;/ref&gt; and Judah remained little more than a sparsely populated rural region, until the 8th century BCE.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 230.&lt;/ref&gt; Though the [[Tel Dan Stele]] seems to confirm that a "House of David" existed, and "clearly validates the biblical description of a figure named David becoming the founder of the dynasty of Judahite kings in Jerusalem", it says nothing else about him.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Mesha Stele (511142469).jpg|left|thumb|150px|Mesha Stele]]
There are remains of once grand cities at [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]], [[Tel Hazor|Hazor]] and [[Gezer]], with archeological evidence showing that they suffered violent destruction.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 135–139&lt;/ref&gt; This destruction once was attributed to the 10th century BCE campaigns by [[Shishak]], these cities therefore being ascribed to David and Solomon as proof of the Bible's account of them,&lt;ref name="p141-2"&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 141–142&lt;/ref&gt; but the destruction layers have since been redated to the late 9th century BCE campaign of [[Hazael]], and the cities to the time of the [[Omrides|Omride]] kings.&lt;ref name="p141-2" /&gt;

The [[Tel Dan Stele]], the [[Mesha Stele]], the [[Black Obelisk|Black Obelisk of Shalmaneser]], and direct evidence from excavations, together paint a picture of the Omride kings ruling a rich, powerful, and cosmopolitan empire, stretching from [[Damascus]] to [[Moab]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 178–180.&lt;/ref&gt; and building some of the largest and most beautiful constructions of Iron Age Israel;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 182.&lt;/ref&gt; by contrast, the Bible only remarks that the Omrides 'married foreign women' (presumably to make [[Marriage alliances|alliances]]) and upheld Canaanite religion, both of which it regards as wicked.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 194.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Bible Unearthed'' concludes that the biblical writers deliberately invented the empire, power, and wealth, of Saul, David, and Solomon, by appropriating the deeds and achievements of the Omrides, so that they could then denigrate the Omrides and obscure their accomplishments, since these kings held a religious viewpoint that was anathema to the biblical editors.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 194–195.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hezekiah and monolatry===

The Book of Kings, as it stands today, seems to suggest that the religion of Israel and Judah was primarily monotheistic, with one or two wayward kings (such as the Omrides) who tried to introduce Canaanite polytheism, the people occasionally joining in this 'apostasy' from monotheism, but a close reading and the archaeological record reveals that the opposite was true.&lt;ref name="p241-2"&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 241–242.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Iron Age]] remains show that in the time of the setting of the Book of Kings, sacrifices continued to be offered at hilltop shrines (which the Bible terms "high places"), incense and libations were being offered throughout the land, and clay figurines of deities were still being used in homes everywhere in the land as [[Household deity|household gods]].&lt;ref name="p241-2" /&gt; Inscriptions from "the early eighth century site of [[Kuntillet Ajrud]] in northeastern Sinai" as well as "in a late-monarchic inscription from the [[Shephelah]] of Judah", even seem to refer to "the goddess [[Asherah]] as being the consort of [[YHWH]]".&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 242.&lt;/ref&gt;

The world changed for Judah when the kingdom of Israel fell to the Assyrians in 720 BCE. Judah was flooded with refugees; the population of Israel had been nine times larger than that of Judah, so many small Judean villages suddenly became cities,&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 245.&lt;/ref&gt; archaeology evidencing that the population of Jerusalem itself expanded by about 15-fold, turning it from a small hilltown into a large city.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 243.&lt;/ref&gt; The social and religious struggles, which obviously would occur with such a large influx of population, are not mentioned by the Bible. Finkelstein and Silberman argue that the priests of Jerusalem began to promote Yahweh-based [[monolatry]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 247.&lt;/ref&gt; aligning themselves with king [[Hezekiah]]'s anti-Assyrian views, perhaps because they believed that Assyrian domination of Israel had caused social injustice, or perhaps because they just wanted to gain economic and/or political control over the newly wealthy countryside;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 248.&lt;/ref&gt; Hezekiah advanced their agenda, banning the worship of deities other than Yahweh, destroying the hilltop shrines, actions which ''The Bible Unearthed'' views as preparation for rebelling against Assyria.

By 701 BCE, the Assyrians had captured most of Judah, and [[Assyrian Siege of Jerusalem|then they besieged Jerusalem]]; the Bible's coverage of the events leading up to the siege is sparse, briefly listing only a few refortifications of Jerusalem, giving a passing mention to the [[Siloam tunnel]], and briefly admitting to the loss of most of Judah's cities, but archaeology gives much more detail. For example, the fortifications of [[Lachish]] were heavily strengthened by Hezekiah,&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 257.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was besieged, fell, and was then burnt to the ground; according to an illustration on the walls of the Assyrian palace at [[Ninevah]], the Assyrians deported the city's population and religious objects before they burnt it.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 260–262.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Bible claims that nearly 200,000 men in the army besieging Jerusalem were slaughtered one night by an [[angel]], causing the Assyrian king [[Sennacherib]] to relent and return to Assyria; it immediately goes on to state that Sennacherib was killed by his sons, while he was praying to his god, implying that this was shortly after the battle. However, as ''The Bible Unearthed'' points out, this contrasts with the Assyrian record on the [[Taylor Prism]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 259.&lt;/ref&gt; in which Hezekiah's mercenaries abandoned him, and he only then convinced the Assyrian army to leave by handing over not only vast amounts of money, jewels, and high quality ivory-inlaid furniture, but also his own daughters, harem, and musicians, and making Judah into a [[tributary state]] of the Assyrians.&lt;ref name="Taylor 3 37-49"&gt;(Taylor Prism", column 3, rows 37–49.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, although Sennacherib was clearly murdered (by person(s) uncertain), it was in 681 BCE; he had lived for over 19 years beyond the end of the siege, conducting several military campaigns elsewhere, and rebuilding and refurnishing his palace entirely.

Hezekiah predeceased Sennacherib, dying just a couple of years after the siege. His successor (and son), [[Manasseh of Judah|Manasseh]], reversed the religious changes, re-introducing religious pluralism; Finkelstein and Silberman suggest that this may have been an attempt to gain co-operation from village elders and clans, so that he would not need so much centralised administration, and could therefore allow the countryside to return to economic autonomy.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; According to the archaeology there must have been a deliberate expansion of agriculture into the [[Negev|Judean desert]],&lt;ref name="p66"&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 266.&lt;/ref&gt; and the rich finds from this period suggest that much profit was gained from Judah's now peaceful position in the middle of many of the caravan routes between Assyria's allies;&lt;ref name="p66" /&gt; the state certainly increased its administration of trade to levels that far exceed those before.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 269–270.&lt;/ref&gt;

Hezekiah's actions had given away the gold and silver from the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jerusalem Temple]],&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse|2|Kings|18:15-16|}}&lt;/ref&gt; impoverished his state, lost him his own daughters and concubines,&lt;ref name="Taylor 3 37-49" /&gt; and reduced his territory to a small region around Jerusalem, most of the people elsewhere in Judah being deported; Manasseh had brought peace and prosperity back to the country,&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 271.&lt;/ref&gt; but because the Book of Kings bases its decisions on theological prejudice, it condemns him as the most sinful monarch ever to rule Judah and hails instead Hezekiah as the great king.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 270.&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Bible Unearthed'' suggests that the priesthood and populace outside Jerusalem may well have held the opposite opinion—that Hezekiah's imposition of monolatry was blasphemous, and the disasters that befell the country during his reign had been punishment from the gods.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Josiah and the birth of the Bible===
As recorded in the Book of Kings, Manasseh's grandson, [[Josiah]], enacted a large religious reform soon after he became king; he ordered renovations to the Jerusalem Temple, during which the [[Kohen Gadol|High Priest]] 'found' a ''scroll of the law'', which insisted on monotheism with sacrifice centralised at a single temple—that in Jerusalem. Finkelstein and Silberman note that most scholars regard the core of [[Deuteronomy]] as being the "scroll of the law" in question, and regard it as having been written not long before it was 'found', rather than being an ancient missing scroll as characterised in the Bible;&lt;ref name="p281"&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 281.&lt;/ref&gt; Deuteronomy is strikingly similar to early 7th century Assyrian [[vassal]]-treaties, in which are set out the rights and obligations of a vassal state (in this case Judah) to their sovereign (in this case, Yahweh).&lt;ref name="p281" /&gt; Josiah imposed this ''scroll'' as the new religious orthodoxy, and, like Hezekiah before him, destroyed the old cult centres; Josiah even went so far as to slaughter the priests of these shrines, burn their bodies, and bury their bones in the tombs near them, upon the old altars.

The sudden collapse of the Assyrian Empire in the last decades of the 7th century BCE offered an opportunity for Josiah to expand Judah's territory into the former kingdom of Israel, abandoned by the Assyrians.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 282–283.&lt;/ref&gt; It was now that [[deuteronomist|the author of Deuteronomy]], working in Josiah's court, reworked older legends, texts, and histories into a single national history;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 283–284.&lt;/ref&gt; with the message that it had been the non-Deuteronomic practices of the Israelites that had led to their downfalls, and implied that Joshua, as well as David in some respects, was a foreshadowing of what Josiah could achieve.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

Archaeology suggests that Josiah was initially successful, extending his territory northwards towards [[Bethel]], a cult-centre of the kingdom of Israel;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 288–289.&lt;/ref&gt; however he then rode out to meet the Egyptian Pharaoh—[[Necho II|Necho]]—at Meggido. Necho had been merely 'passing through', leading an army to join the Assyrian civil war on the side of the Assyrian (rather than [[Babylon]]ian) faction,&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 290.&lt;/ref&gt; but Josiah was killed; the circumstances of his death are uncertain, though the [[Book of Chronicles]] claims that despite Necho's lack of enmity for Josiah, Josiah insisted on attacking him. Finkelstein and Silberman suggest that Necho may have objected to Josiah's expansionist policies, which could have threatened the Egyptian dominance of the region to the west of Judah (the Philistine lands) or of the strategically important [[Jezreel Valley]] to its north, or could equally have objected to the effect of the new (deuteronomic) social policies on the caravan routes, which ran through southern Judah.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 291.&lt;/ref&gt;

With Josiah's death Egypt became [[suzerainty|suzerain]] over Judah. The new king, Egypt's vassal ruler, undid Josiah's changes, restoring the former shrines and returning the country once again to religious pluralism. But when the Babylonian faction eventually won the Assyrian civil war, they set out to forcibly retake the former Assyrian tributaries. Judah, as a loyal Egyptian vassal-state, resisted, with disastrous consequences: the Babylonians plundered Jerusalem in 597 BCE and imposed their own vassal king; these events are described in the Bible and confirmed, with variations, in the Babylonian Chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 293.&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later, the king of Judah rebelled against his Babylonian masters, and the Babylonians returned to destroy all the cities in Judah, burning Jerusalem to the ground in 587 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 294.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Cyrus Cylinder.jpg|right|thumb|240px|The Cyrus cylinder, a contemporary [[cuneiform script|cuneiform]] document proclaiming Cyrus as legitimate king of Babylon.]]
In 539 BCE, the [[Achaemenid]]s conquered Babylon, and, in accordance with their [[zoroastrianism|Zoroastrian]] perspective, allowed the people deported by the Babylonians to return; this is described by the [[Cyrus Cylinder]], which also indicates that the Persians repaired the temples in these conquered lands, returning any sacred artifacts to them. According to the archaeological record, no more than 25% of the population had actually been deported;&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; according to the [[Book of Ezra]] and its parallel passages in the [[1 Esdras|First Book of Esdras]], when the deportees began to return, their leader—[[Zerubbabel]]—refused to allow the undeported Israelites to assist them in reconstructing the Jerusalem temple, apparently believing that only the former deportees had the right to determine the beliefs and practices which could count as the [[orthodoxy]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 299.&lt;/ref&gt; Although the undeported majority then tried to stop the reconstruction, [[Darius I of Persia|Darius]], the new Achaemenid king, eventually allowed it to continue.

The conflict between the returnees and those who had always been in Judah evidently required resolution; the two groups had to be reintegrated. Finkelstein and Silberman argue that the Deuteronomic law advanced by parts of the deported elite (the ancestors of the returnees),&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 308.&lt;/ref&gt; and the laws and legends of the inveterate inhabitants, were melded together into a single [[Torah]] so that it could form a central authority able to unite the population.&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 313.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Artaxerxes I of Persia|Artaxerxes]], Darius' grandson, commissioned [[Ezra]] to take charge of Judah, following the divine laws which Ezra was holding in his hand;&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezra|7:25|}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Bible Unearthed'' comments that academics like [[Richard Elliott Friedman]] propose that Ezra himself was the [[Documentary hypothesis#R, Redactor|final redactor of the Torah]],&lt;ref&gt;''The Bible Unearthed'', p. 310.&lt;/ref&gt; noting that the Bible identifies him as ''the scribe of the law of the god of heaven''.&lt;ref&gt;{{bibleverse||Ezra|7:12|}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''The Bible Unearthed'' was well received by some biblical scholars and archaeologists and critically by others. [[Baruch Halpern]], professor of Jewish Studies at [[Pennsylvania State University]] and leader of the archaeological digs at [[Tel Megiddo|Megiddo]] for many years, praised it as "the boldest and most exhilarating synthesis of Bible and archaeology in fifty years",&lt;ref&gt;http://icarusfilms.com/new2006/bib.html&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jonathan Kirsch]], writing in the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', called it "a brutally honest assessment of what archeology can and cannot tell us about the historical accuracy of the Bible", which embraces the spirit of modern archaeology by approaching the Bible "as an artifact to be studied and evaluated rather than a work of divine inspiration that must be embraced as a matter of true belief".&lt;ref&gt;Kirsch, Jonathan. [http://articles.latimes.com/2001/jan/06/local/me-9147 "Digging for the Historical Truths of the Bible"], ''Los Angeles Times'', 6 January 2001.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Phyllis Trible]], professor of biblical studies at [[Wake Forest University]], concluded her review in ''[[The New York Times]]'' as follows:
{{cquote|Finkelstein and Silberman have themselves written a provocative book that bears the marks of a detective story. In juxtaposing the biblical record and archaeological data, they work with tantalizing fragments of a distant past. Assembling clues to argue their thesis requires bold imagination and disciplined research. ''The Bible Unearthed'' exhibits both in abundance. Imagination invariably exceeds the evidence; research makes plausible the reconstruction. Fortunately, the book does not achieve its goal: "to attempt to separate history from legend." It is better than that, for it shows how intertwined they are. What ''actually happened'' and what a people thought happened belong to a single historical process. That understanding leads to a sobering thought. Stories of exodus from oppression and conquest of land, stories of exile and return and stories of triumphal vision are eerily contemporary. If history is written for the present, are we doomed to repeat the past?&lt;ref&gt;[[Phyllis Trible|Trible, Phyllis]]. [https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9A00EEDE173FF937A35751C0A9679C8B63&amp;scp=1&amp;sq=The+Bible+Unearthed&amp;st=nyt "God's Ghostwriters"], ''The New York Times'', 4 February 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Kenneth Kitchen]] was critical, writing that "[A] careful critical perusal of this work—which certainly has much to say about both archaeology and the biblical writings—reveals that we are dealing very largely with a work of imaginative fiction, not a serious or reliable account of the subject", and "Their treatment of the exodus is among the most factually ignorant and misleading that this writer has ever read."&lt;ref&gt;Kitchen, Kenneth Anderson. On the reliability of the Old Testament, p. 464-465. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Richard Hess]], also being critical, wrote that "The authors always present their interpretation of the archaeological data but do not mention or interact with contemporary alternative approaches. Thus the book is ideologically driven and controlled."&lt;ref&gt;Hess, Richard. Review of The Bible Unearthed: Archaeology’s New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of It’s Sacred Text, by Israel Finkelstein and Neil Silberman.&lt;/ref&gt;

A review of the book by fellow archeologist [[William G. Dever]] published in the ''[[Biblical Archaeology Review]]'' and subsequently in the ''[[Bulletin of the American Schools of Oriental Research]]'', resulted in heated exchanges between Dever and Finkelstein. Dever's review noted that the book had many strengths, notably archaeology's potential for re-writing the history of "Ancient Israel", but complained that it misrepresented his own views and concluded by characterizing Finkelstein as "idiosyncratic and doctrinaire"; Finkelstein's reaction was to call Dever a "jealous academic parasite," and the debate quickly degenerated from that point.&lt;ref&gt;Shanks, Hershel. "In This Corner: William Dever and Israel Finkelstein Debate the Early History of Israel", ''Biblical Archaeology Review'', Nov/Dec 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

The book became a bestseller within its field. In February 2009, [[Amazon.com]] ranked it as the 8th most popular in the fields of Old Testament Christian Theology, and the Archaeology of Christianity, as well as being the 22nd most popular book on the history of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/0684869136 Ranking], Amazon.com, as of 28 February 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2006, the popularity of the text led to a four-part documentary series upon it, which was subsequently broadcast on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|The History Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;http://icarusfilms.com/new2006/bib2.html&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Great Illusion''''' is a book by [[Norman Angell]], first published in the United Kingdom in 1909 under the title ''Europe's Optical Illusion''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Angell |first=Norman |title=Europe's Optical Illusion|edition=1|publisher=Simpkin, Marshall, Hamilton, Kent &amp; Co.|publication-date=1909|publication-place=London|page=|url=https://archive.org/stream/europesopticalil00angeuoft#page/n7/mode/2up |accessdate=15 June 2016|via= Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; and republished in 1910 and subsequently in various enlarged and revised editions under the title ''The Great Illusion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Angell |first=Norman |title=The Great Illusion: A Study of the Relation of Military Power in Nations to their Economic and Social Advantage|edition=3|publisher=G.P.

==Content==

In ''The Great Illusion'', Angell's primary thesis was, in the words of historian [[James Joll]], that "the economic cost of war was so great that no one could possibly hope to gain by starting a war the consequences of which would be so disastrous."&lt;ref&gt;[[James Joll|Joll, James]] (1992) ''The Origins of the First World War''. London and New York: Longman. p.202 {{ISBN|0-582-08920-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; For that reason, a general European war was very unlikely to start, and if it did, it would not last long.&lt;ref name=keegan&gt;[[John Keegan|Keegan, John]] (1999) ''The First World War'' New York: Knopf. p.10. {{ISBN|0-375-40052-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that war was economically and socially irrational&lt;ref name=pity&gt;[[Niall Ferguson|Ferguson, Niall]] (1999) ''The Pity of War'' New York: Basic Books. pp.21-23 {{ISBN|0-465-05712-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that war between industrial countries was futile because conquest did not pay. J. D. B. Miller writes: "The 'Great Illusion' was that nations gained by armed confrontation, militarism, war, or conquest."&lt;ref name=miller1985&gt;Miller (1995), p.105.&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to Angell, the economic interdependence between industrial countries would be "the real guarantor of the good behavior of one state to another",&lt;ref name=pity /&gt; as it meant that war would be economically harmful to all the countries involved. Moreover, if a conquering power confiscated property in the territory it seized, "the incentive [of the local population] to produce would be sapped and the conquered area be rendered worthless. Thus, the conquering power had to leave property in the hands of the local population while incurring the costs of conquest and occupation."&lt;ref name=miller1985 /&gt;

Further, the nature of modern capitalism was such that nationalist sentiment did not motivate capitalists, because "the capitalist has no country, and he knows, if he be of the modern type, that arms and conquests and jugglery with frontiers serve no ends of his, and may very well defeat them."&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in [[James Joll|Joll, James]] (1992) ''The Origins of the First World War''. London and New York: Longman. p.161 {{ISBN|0-582-08920-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Angell said that arms build-up, for example the naval race between England and Germany that was happening as he wrote the book in the 1900s, was not going to secure peace. Instead, it would lead to increased insecurity and thus ratchet up the likelihood of war. The only viable route to peace would be respect for international law, implemented in a world court, in which issues would be dealt with rationally and peacefully.

==Critical reception==

''The Great Illusion'' was a best-selling popular success and was quickly translated into eleven languages, becoming something of a "cult", spawning study groups at British universities "devoted to propagating its dogma." The book was taken up by [[Reginald Brett, 2nd Viscount Esher|Viscount Esher]], a courtier who was charged with remodeling the British Army after the [[Boer War]].&lt;ref name=guns&gt;[[Barbara Tuchman|Tuchman, Barbara]] (1962) ''[[The Guns of August]]'' New York: Macmillan. p.10&lt;/ref&gt; Also enamored of the book was [[John Fisher, 1st Baron Fisher|Admiral John Fisher]], the [[First Sea Lord]], who called it "heavenly manna".&lt;ref name=pity /&gt; Historian [[Niall Ferguson]] uses the receptiveness to the book of these paragons of the British military and naval establishments as evidence that it was not the pacifist work it superficially seemed to be, but instead a "Liberal imperialist tract directed at German opinion", with the aim of discouraging Germany from continuing its bid to become a great naval power, a program which had begun the fierce, and expensive, naval arms race between the United Kingdom and Germany.  The fact that Angell was employed as editor of the ''Continental Daily Mail'' by [[Alfred Harmsworth, 1st Viscount Northcliffe|Lord Northcliffe]], a press baron whom Ferguson refers to as an "arch-scaremonger", is to Ferguson further evidence of a deeper, non-pacifist purpose to the book.&lt;ref name=pity /&gt;

It is sometimes said that the outbreak of [[World War I]] disproved Angell's argument in ''The Great Illusion,'' but Angell had not maintained that a war was impossible, rather that it would be futile. Although some aspects of Angell's argument have dated, his discussion of economic interdependence "was important and innovative."&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1986), p.106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interwar edition==
A new edition of ''The Great Illusion'' was published in 1933; it added "the theme of collective defence."&lt;ref&gt;Miller (1986) p.120 n.9.&lt;/ref&gt;  Angell was awarded the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1933.

==In popular culture  ==
*''The Great Illusion'' is mentioned in the 1929 novel ''[[Death of a Hero]]'' by [[Richard Aldington]]. It was used as evidence by the main character that the coming world war would not happen.

*One of the characters in the [[D. K. Broster]] story "The Window" (1929), set in pre-World War I France, mentions having read Angell's book, and uses it to argue that "it is impossible that there should be a great war nowadays".&lt;ref&gt;Williams, Andrew J.

[[File:Aqua Tower thermal imaging.jpg|thumb|This thermal image shows a thermal bridging of a high-rise building ([[Aqua (skyscraper)|Aqua]] in [[Chicago]])]]A '''thermal bridge''', also called a '''cold bridge''', '''heat bridge''', or '''thermal bypass''', is an area or component of an object which has higher [[thermal conductivity]] than the surrounding materials,&lt;ref name="Binggeli"&gt;{{cite book|title=Building Systems for Interior Designers|last=Binggeli|first=C.|date=2010|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|location=Hoboken, NJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; creating a path of least resistance for [[heat transfer]].&lt;ref name="oxford"&gt;Gorse, Christopher A., and David Johnston (2012). "Thermal bridge", in ''Oxford Dictionary of Construction, Surveying, and Civil Engineering''. 3rd ed. Oxford: Oxford UP, 2012 pp. 440-441. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; Thermal bridges result in an overall reduction in [[thermal resistance]] of the object. The term is frequently discussed in the context of a building's [[thermal envelope]] where thermal bridges result in heat transfer into or out of conditioned space.

Thermal bridges in buildings may impact the amount of energy required to heat and cool a space, cause condensation (moisture) within the building envelope,&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nrel.gov/docs/fy16osti/65147.pdf|title=Construction Guidelines for High R-Value Walls without Exterior Rigid Insulation|last=Arena|first=Lois|date=July 2016|year=2016|website=NREL.gov|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory (NREL)|format=PDF|publication-place=Golden, CO|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and result in thermal discomfort. In colder climates (such as The United Kingdom), thermal heat bridges can result in additional heat losses and require additional energy to mitigate.

There are strategies to reduce or prevent thermal bridging, such as limiting the number of building members that span from unconditioned to conditioned space and applying continuous insulation materials to create [[thermal break]]s.


==Concept==
[[File:Jonction plancher haut-mur extérieur 2.jpg|thumb|200px|right|Thermal bridge at junction. Heat moves from the floor structure through the wall because there is no thermal break.]]
Heat transfer occurs through three mechanisms: [[convection]], [[Thermal radiation|radiation]], and [[Thermal conduction|conduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Essentials of Heat Transfer: Principles, Materials, and Applications|last=Kaviany|first=Massoud|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=2011|isbn=1107012406|location=New York, NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; A thermal bridge is an example of heat transfer through conduction. The rate of heat transfer depends on the thermal conductivity of the material and the temperature difference experienced on either side of the thermal bridge. When a temperature difference is present, heat flow will follow the path of least resistance through the material with the highest thermal conductivity and lowest thermal resistance; this path is a thermal bridge.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://passipedia.org/basics/building_physics_-_basics/thermal_bridges/thermal_bridge_definition|title=Definition and effects of thermal bridges [  ]|website=passipedia.org|language=en|access-date=2017-11-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thermal bridging describes a situation in a building where there is a direct connection between the outside and inside through one or more elements that possess a higher thermal conductivity than the rest of the envelope of the building. 

==Identifying Thermal Bridges==
Surveying buildings for thermal bridges is performed using passive [[infrared thermography]] (IRT) according to the [[International Organization for Standardization]] (ISO). Infrared Thermography of buildings can allow thermal signatures that indicate heat leaks. IRT detects thermal abnormalities that are linked to the movement of fluids through building elements, highlighting the variations in the thermal properties of the materials that correspondingly cause a major change in temperature. The drop shadow effect, a situation in which the surrounding environment casts a shadow on the facade of the building, can lead to potential accuracy issues of measurements through inconsistent facade sun exposure. An alternative analysis method, Iterative Filtering (IF), can be used to solve this problem.

In all thermographic building inspections, the thermal image interpretation if performed by a human operator, involving a high level of subjectivity and expertise of the operator. Automated analysis approaches, such as [[Laser scanning]] technologies can provide thermal imaging on 3 dimensional [[CAD]] model surfaces and metric information to thermographic analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Previtali |first1=Mattia |last2=Barazzetti |first2=Luigi |last3=Roncoroni |first3=Fabio |title=Spatial Data Management for Energy Efficient Envelope Retrofitting |journal=Computational Science and Its Applications – ICCSA 2013 |date=24-27 June 2013 |doi=10.1007/978-3-642-39637-3_48}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surface temperature data in 3D models can identify and measure thermal irregularities of thermal bridges and insulation leaks. Thermal imaging can also be acquired through the use of [[unmanned aerial vehicles]] (UAV), fusing thermal data from multiple cameras and platforms. The UAV uses an infrared camera to generate a thermal field image of recorded temperature values, where every pixel represents radiative energy emitted by the surface of the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Garrido |first1=I. |last2=Lagüela |first2=S. |last3=Arias |first3=P. |last4=Balado |first4=J. |title=Thermal-based analysis for the automatic detection and characterization of thermal bridges in buildings |journal=Energy and Buildings |date=1 January 2018 |volume=158 |pages=1358-1367 |doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2017.11.031 |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Thermal Bridging in Construction==
Frequently, thermal bridging is used in reference to a building’s thermal envelope, which is a layer of the building enclosure system that resists heat flow between the interior conditioned environment and the exterior unconditioned environment. Heat will transfer through a building’s thermal envelope at different rates depending on the materials present throughout the envelope. Heat transfer will be greater at thermal bridge locations than where insulation exists because there is less thermal resistance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://buildingscience.com/documents/reports/rr-0901-thermal-metrics-high-performance-walls-limitations-r-value/view|title=RR-0901: Thermal Metrics for High-Performance Walls—The Limitations of R-Value|work=Building Science Corporation|access-date=2017-11-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the winter, when exterior temperature is typically lower than interior temperature, heat flows outward and will flow at greater rates through thermal bridges. At a thermal bridge location, the surface temperature on the inside of the building envelope will be lower than the surrounding area. In the summer, when the exterior temperature is typically higher than the interior temperature, heat flows inward, and at greater rates through thermal bridges.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Mechanical and Electrical Equipment for Buildings|last=Grondzik|first=Walter|last2=Kwok|first2=Alison|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2014|isbn=0470195657|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This causes winter heat losses and summer heat gains for conditioned spaces in buildings.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Larbi|first=A. Ben|title=Statistical modelling of heat transfer for thermal bridges of buildings|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2004.12.013|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=37|issue=9|pages=945–951|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2004.12.013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite insulation requirements specified by various national regulations, thermal bridging in a building's envelope remain a weak spot in the construction industry. Moreover, in many countries building design practices implement partial insulation measurements foreseen by regulations.&lt;ref&gt;THEODOSIOU, T. G, and A. M PAPADOPOULOS. 2008. “The Impact of Thermal Bridges on the Energy Demand of Buildings with Double Brick Wall Constructions.” Energy and Buildings, no. 11: 2083. https://libproxy.berkeley.edu/login?qurl=http%3a%2f%2fsearch.ebscohost.com%2flogin.aspx%3fdirect%3dtrue%26db%3dedscal%26AN%3dedscal.20659411%26site%3deds-live.&lt;/ref&gt; As a result, thermal losses are greater in practice that is anticipated during the design stage.

An assembly such as an exterior wall or insulated ceiling is generally classified by a [[R-value (insulation)|U-factor]], in W/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;·K, that reflects the overall rate of heat transfer per unit area for all the materials within an assembly, not just the insulation layer. Heat transfer via thermal bridges reduces the overall thermal resistance of an assembly, resulting in an increased U-factor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kossecka|first=E.|last2=Kosny|first2=J.|date=2016-09-16|title=Equivalent Wall as a Dynamic Model of a Complex Thermal Structure|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/109719639702000306|journal=Journal of Thermal Insulation and Building Envelopes|language=en|volume=20|issue=3|pages=249–268|doi=10.1177/109719639702000306}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thermal bridges can occur at several locations within a building envelope; most commonly, they occur at junctions between two or more building elements. Common locations include:
*Floor-to-wall or balcony-to-wall junctions, including slab-on-grade and [[concrete]] balconies or outdoor patios that extend the [[floor slab]] through the building envelope
*Roof/Ceiling-to-wall junctions, especially where full ceiling insulation depths may not be achieved

Structural elements remain a weak point in construction, commonly leading to thermal bridges that result in high heat loss and low surface temperatues in a room.

===Masonry Buildings===
While thermal bridges exist in various types of building enclosures, [[Masonry|masonry walls]] experience significantly increased U-factors caused by thermal bridges. Comparing [[list of thermal conductivities|thermal conductivities]] between different building materials allows for assessment of performance relative to other design options. Brick materials, which are usually used for facade enclosures, typically have higher thermal conductivities than timber, depending on the brick density and wood type.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|title=2017 ASHRAE Handbook: Fundamentals|last=American Society of Heating, Refrigeration and Air-Conditioning Engineers, Inc. (ASHRAE)|first=|publisher=ASHRAE|year=2017|isbn=1939200571|location=Atlanta, GA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Concrete, which may be used for floors and edge beams in masonry buildings are common thermal bridges, especially at the corners. Depending on the physical makeup of the concrete, the thermal conductivity can be greater than that of brick materials.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; In addition to heat transfer, if the indoor environment is not adequately vented, thermal bridging may cause the brick material to absorb rainwater and humidity into the wall, which can result in mold growth and deterioration of building envelope material.

===Curtain Wall===
Similar to masonry walls, [[Curtain wall (architecture)|curtain walls]] can experience significantly increases U-factors due to thermal bridging. Curtain wall frames are often constructed with highly conductive aluminum, which has a typical thermal conductivity above 200 W/m·K. In comparison, wood framing members are typically between 0.68 and 1.25 W/m·K.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; The aluminum frame for most curtain wall constructions extends from the exterior of the building through to the interior, creating thermal bridges.&lt;ref name="Totten"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Totten|first=Paul E.|last2=O’Brien|first2=Sean M.|date=2008|title=The Effects of Thermal Bridging at Interface Conditions|journal=Building Enclosure Science &amp; Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Impacts of Thermal Bridging ===
Thermal bridging can result in increased energy required to heat or cool a conditioned space due to winter heat loss and summer heat gain. At interior locations near thermal bridges, occupants may experience thermal discomfort due to the difference in temperature.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ge|first=Hua|last2=McClung|first2=Victoria Ruth|last3=Zhang|first3=Shenshu|title=Impact of balcony thermal bridges on the overall thermal performance of multi-unit residential buildings: A case study|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.01.004|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=60|pages=163–173|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2013.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, when the temperature difference between indoor and outdoor space is large and there is warm and humid air indoors, such as the conditions experienced in the winter, there is a risk of condensation in the building envelope due to the cooler temperature on the interior surface at thermal bridge locations.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Condensation can ultimately result in mold growth with consequent poor indoor air quality and insulation degradation, reducing the insulation performance and causing insulation to perform inconsistently throughout the thermal envelope&lt;ref name="Miimu"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matilainen|first=Miimu|last2=Jarek|first2=Kurnitski|date=2002|title=Moisture conditions in highly insulated outdoor ventilated crawl spaces in cold climates|journal=Energy and buildings|volume=35|issue=2|pages=175–187|doi=10.1016/S0378-7788(02)00029-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design Methods to Reduce Thermal Bridges==
There are several methods that have been proven to reduce or eliminate thermal bridging depending on the cause, location, and the construction type. The objective of these methods is to either create a [[thermal break]] where a building component would span from exterior to interior otherwise, or to reduce the number of building components spanning from exterior to interior. These strategies include:

*A continuous thermal [[building insulation|insulation]] layer in the thermal envelope, such as with rigid foam board insulation&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
*Lapping of insulation where direct continuity is not possible
*Double and staggered wall assemblies&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Residential Compliance Manual for the 2016 Building Energy Efficiency Standards|last=California Energy Commission (CEC)|first=|publisher=California Energy Commission|year=2015|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Structural insulated panel|Structural Insulated Panels]] (SIPs) and [[Insulating concrete form|Insulating Concrete Forms]] (ICFs)&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
*Reducing framing factor by eliminating unnecessary framing members, such as implemented with advanced framing&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;
*Raised heel trusses at wall-to-roof junctions to increase insulation depth
*Quality insulation installation without voids or compressed insulation
*Installing double or triple pane windows with gas filler and low-emissivity coating&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gustavsen|first=Arild|last2=Grynning|first2=Steinar|last3=Arasteh|first3=Dariush|last4=Jelle|first4=Bjørn Petter|last5=Goudey|first5=Howdy|title=Key elements of and material performance targets for highly insulating window frames|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2011.05.010|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=43|issue=10|pages=2583–2594|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2011.05.010}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Installing windows with thermally broken frames made of low conductivity material&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

==Analysis Methods and Challenges==
Due to their significant impacts on heat transfer, correctly modeling the impacts of thermal bridges is important to estimate overall energy use. Thermal bridges are characterized by multi-dimensional heat transfer, and therefore they cannot be adequately approximated by steady-state one-dimensional (1D) models of calculation typically used to estimate the thermal performance of buildings in most building energy simulation tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Martin|first=K.|last2=Erkoreka|first2=A.|last3=Flores|first3=I.|last4=Odriozola|first4=M.|last5=Sala|first5=J.M.|title=Problems in the calculation of thermal bridges in dynamic conditions|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.enbuild.2010.10.018|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=43|issue=2-3|pages=529–535|doi=10.1016/j.enbuild.2010.10.018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Steady state heat transfer models are based on simple heat flow where heat is driven by a temperature difference that does not fluctuate over time so that heat flow is always in one direction. This type of 1D model can substantially underestimate heat transfer through the envelope when thermal bridges are present, resulting in lower predicted building energy use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mao|first=Guofeng|last2=Johanneson|first2=Gudni|date=1997|title=Dynamic Calculation of Thermal Bridges|url=|journal=Energy and Buildings|volume=26|pages=233–240|via=Elsevier Science Direct|doi=10.1016/s0378-7788(97)00005-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The currently available solutions are to enable two-dimensional (2D) and three-dimensional (3D) heat transfer capabilities in modeling software or, more commonly, to use a method that translates multi-dimensional heat transfer into an equivalent 1D component to use in building simulation software. This latter method can be accomplished through the equivalent wall method in which a complex dynamic assembly, such as a wall with a thermal bridge, is represented by a 1D multi-layered assembly that has equivalent thermal characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Kossecka|first=E.|last2=Kosny|first2=J.|date=January 1997|title=Equivalent Wall as a Dynamic Model of a Complex Thermal Structure|url=|journal=J.

'''Vitalism''' is the belief that "living organisms are fundamentally different from non-living entities because they contain some non-physical element or are governed by different principles than are inanimate things".&lt;ref name=Bechtel&gt;{{cite book |url=http://mechanism.ucsd.edu/teaching/philbio/vitalism.htm |author=Bechtel, William; Williamson, Robert C. |year=1998 |title=Vitalism |editor=E. Craig |work=Routledge Encyclopedia of Philosophy |publisher=Routledge}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{ref|reference_name_A|a}} Where vitalism explicitly invokes a vital principle, that element is often referred to as the "vital spark", "energy" or "[[élan vital]]", which some equate with the [[soul (spirit)|soul]]. In the 18th and 19th centuries vitalism was [[Alternatives to evolution by natural selection|discussed among biologists]], between those who felt that the known mechanics of physics would eventually explain the difference between life and non-life and vitalists who argued that the processes of life could not be reduced to a mechanistic process. Some vitalist biologists proposed [[Falsifiability|testable hypotheses]] meant to show inadequacies with mechanistic explanations, but these experiments failed to provide support for vitalism. Biologists now consider vitalism in this sense to have been refuted by [[Scientific evidence|empirical evidence]], and hence regard it as a [[Superseded scientific theories|superseded scientific theory]].&lt;ref name="Williams2003"&gt;{{cite book |last=Williams |first=Elizabeth Ann |title=A Cultural History of Medical Vitalism in Enlightenment Montpellier |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AvqYl4sdwaYC&amp;pg=PA4 |year=2003 |publisher=Ashgate |isbn=978-0-7546-0881-3 |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vitalism has a long history in [[medical]] philosophies: many [[traditional medicine|traditional healing]] practices posited that disease results from some imbalance in vital forces.

== History ==

===Ancient times===
The notion that bodily functions are due to a vitalistic principle existing in all living creatures has roots going back at least to ancient [[Egypt]].&lt;ref&gt;Jidenu, Paulin (1996) ''African Philosophy, 2nd Ed.'' Indiana University Press, {{ISBN|0-253-21096-8}}, p.16.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Greek philosophy]], the [[Milesian school]] proposed natural explanations [[deductive argument|deduced]] from [[materialism]] and [[Mechanism (philosophy)|mechanism]]. However, by the time of [[Lucretius]], this account was supplemented, (for example, by the unpredictable ''[[clinamen]]'' of [[Epicurus]]), and in [[Stoic physics]], the ''[[pneuma]]'' assumed the role of ''[[logos]]''. [[Galen]] believed the lungs draw pneuma from the air, which the blood communicates throughout the body.&lt;ref&gt;Birch, Charles; Cobb, John B. ''The Liberation of Life: From the Cell to the Community'', 1985, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt;

===Medieval===
In Europe, medieval physics was influenced by the idea of pneuma, helping to shape later [[aether theories]].

===Early modern===
Vitalists included English anatomist [[Francis Glisson]] (1597–1677) and the Italian doctor [[Marcello Malpighi]] (1628–1694).&lt;ref name="Charles Birch 1985, pp. 76"&gt;Birch, Charles; Cobb, John B. ''The Liberation of Life: From the Cell to the Community'', 1985, pp. 76–78&lt;/ref&gt; [[Caspar Friedrich Wolff]] (1733–1794) is considered to be the father of [[Epigenesis (biology)|epigenesis]] in [[embryology]], that is, he marks the point when embryonic development began to be described in terms of the proliferation of cells rather than the incarnation of a preformed soul. However, this degree of empirical observation was not matched by a mechanistic philosophy: in his ''[[Theoria Generationis]]'' (1759), he tried to explain the emergence of the organism by the actions of a ''vis essentialis'' (an organizing, formative force), stating "All believers in epigenesis are vitalists." [[Carl Reichenbach]] (1788–1869) later developed the theory of [[Odic force]], a form of life-energy that permeates living things.

In the 17th century, modern science responded to [[Isaac Newton|Newton]]'s [[action at a distance]] and the mechanism of [[Cartesian dualism]] with vitalist theories: that whereas the chemical transformations undergone by non-living substances are reversible, so-called "organic" matter is permanently altered by chemical transformations (such as cooking).&lt;ref name=Ede/&gt;

[[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach]] was influential in establishing epigenesis in the life sciences in 1781 with his publication of ''Über den Bildungstrieb und das Zeugungsgeschäfte''. Blumenbach cut up freshwater ''[[Hydra (zoology)|Hydra]]'' and established that the removed parts would regenerate. He inferred the presence of a "formative drive" (''Bildungstrieb'') in living matter. But he pointed out that this name, "like names applied to every other kind of vital power, of itself, explains nothing: it serves merely to designate a peculiar power formed by the combination of the mechanical principle with that which is susceptible of modification". In the early 18th century, the physicians [[Marie François Xavier Bichat]] and [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] recognized a "living principle" in addition to mechanics.&lt;ref name="Charles Birch 1985, pp. 76" /&gt;

===19th century===
[[File:Albert Edelfelt - Louis Pasteur - 1885.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Louis Pasteur]] argued that only life could catalyse [[fermentation]]. Painting by [[Albert Edelfelt]], 1885]]
{{further|Alternatives to Darwinism}}

[[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]], one of the early 19th century fathers of modern [[chemistry]], argued that a regulative force must exist within living matter to maintain its functions.&lt;ref name=Ede&gt;Ede, Andrew. (2007) ''The Rise and Decline of Colloid Science in North America, 1900–1935: The Neglected Dimension'', p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Vitalist chemists predicted that organic materials could not be synthesized from inorganic components, but [[Friedrich Wöhler]] synthesised [[urea]] from inorganic components in 1828.&lt;ref&gt;[http://content.karger.com/ProdukteDB/produkte.asp?Aktion=ShowPDF&amp;ProduktNr=223979&amp;Ausgabe=225203&amp;ArtikelNr=13463&amp;filename=13463.pdf Vitalism and Synthesis of Urea]&lt;/ref&gt; However, contemporary accounts do not support the common belief that vitalism died when Wöhler made urea. This ''Wöhler Myth'', as historian Peter Ramberg called it, originated from a popular history of chemistry published in 1931, which, "ignoring all pretense of historical accuracy, turned Wöhler into a crusader who made attempt after attempt to synthesize a natural product that would refute vitalism and lift the veil of ignorance, until 'one afternoon the miracle happened'".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioethicsjournal.com/past/cheng.html ''The Real Death of Vitalism: Implications of the Wöhler Myth'']&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Schummer, J. http://www.joachimschummer.net/papers/2003_NatureChemistry_SHPS.pdf, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1845, [[Adolph Kolbe]] succeeded in making acetic acid from inorganic compounds, and in the 1850s, [[Marcellin Berthelot]] repeated this feat for numerous organic compounds. In retrospect, Wöhler's work was the beginning of the end of Berzelius's vitalist hypothesis, but only in retrospect, as Ramberg had shown.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1833 and 1844, [[Johannes Peter Müller]] wrote a book on [[physiology]] called ''Handbuch der Physiologie'', which became the leading textbook in the field for much of the nineteenth century. The book showed Müller's commitments to vitalism; he questioned why organic matter differs from inorganic, then proceeded to chemical analyses of the blood and lymph. He describes in detail the circulatory, lymphatic, respiratory, digestive, endocrine, nervous, and sensory systems in a wide variety of animals but explains that the presence of a [[soul]] makes each organism an indivisible whole. He also claimed the behavior of light and sound waves showed that living organisms possessed a life-energy for which physical laws could never fully account.&lt;ref&gt;{{unreliable source?|date=February 2015}} http://vlp.mpiwg-berlin.mpg.de/pdfgen/essays/enc22.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Louis Pasteur]] (1822–1895) after his famous rebuttal of [[spontaneous generation]], performed several experiments that he felt supported vitalism. According to Bechtel, Pasteur "fitted fermentation into a more general programme describing special reactions that only occur in living organisms. These are irreducibly vital phenomena." Rejecting the claims of Berzelius, [[Liebig]], [[Moritz Traube|Traube]] and others that fermentation resulted from chemical agents or catalysts within cells, Pasteur concluded that fermentation was a "vital action".&lt;ref name=Bechtel/&gt;

===20th century===

[[Hans Driesch]] (1867–1941) interpreted his experiments as showing that life is not run by physicochemical laws.&lt;ref name="DevBio"&gt;{{Failed verification|date=February 2015}}[http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=10&amp;id=110 Developmental Biology 8e Online: A Selective History of Induction] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061031180529/http://7e.devbio.com/article.php?ch=10&amp;id=110 |date=2006-10-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt; His main argument was that when one cuts up an embryo after its first division or two, each part grows into a complete adult. Driesch's reputation as an experimental biologist deteriorated as a result of his vitalistic theories, which scientists have seen since his time as pseudoscience.&lt;ref name="DevBio" /&gt;&lt;ref name=ps&gt;{{cite book |author1=Sebastian Normandin |author2=Charles T.

{{quote|It would be ahistorical to ridicule vitalists. When one reads the writings of one of the leading vitalists like Driesch one is forced to agree with him that many of the basic problems of biology simply cannot be solved by a philosophy as that of Descartes, in which the organism is simply considered a machine... The logic of the critique of the vitalists was impeccable.&lt;ref&gt;Mayr E (2002) ''The Walter Arndt Lecture: The Autonomy of Biology'', adapted for the internet, on {{cite web |url=http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e01_2/autonomy.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060926210457/http://www.biologie.uni-hamburg.de/b-online/e01_2/autonomy.htm |archivedate=2006-09-26 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
{{quote|Vitalism has become so disreputable a belief in the last fifty years that no biologist alive today would want to be classified as a vitalist. Still, the remnants of vitalist thinking can be found in the work of [[Alistair Hardy]], [[Sewall Wright]], and [[Charles Birch]], who seem to believe in some sort of nonmaterial principle in organisms.&lt;ref&gt;Ernst Mayr ''Toward a new philosophy of biology: observations of an evolutionist'' 1988, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other vitalists included [[Johannes Reinke]] and [[Oscar Hertwig]]. Reinke used the word ''neovitalism'' to describe his work, claiming that it would eventually be verified through experimentation, and that it was an improvement over the other vitalistic theories. The work of Reinke influenced [[Carl Jung]].&lt;ref&gt;Noll, Richard. "Jung's Concept of Die Dominanten (The Dominants)". https://www.academia.edu/6789277/Jungs_concept_of_die_Dominanten_the_Dominants_1997_&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Scott Haldane]] adopted an anti-mechanist approach to biology and an [[idealist]] philosophy early on in his career. Haldane saw his work as a vindication of his belief that [[teleology]] was an essential concept in biology. His views became widely known with his first book ''Mechanism, life and personality'' in 1913.&lt;ref name="Peter J. Bowler 2001, pp. 168"&gt;Bowler, Peter J. Reconciling science and religion: the debate in early-twentieth-century Britain, 2001, pp. 168–169&lt;/ref&gt; Haldane borrowed arguments from the vitalists to use against mechanism; however, he was not a vitalist. Haldane treated the organism as fundamental to biology: "we perceive the organism as a self-regulating entity", "every effort to analyze it into components that can be reduced to a mechanical explanation violates this central experience".&lt;ref name="Peter J. Bowler 2001, pp. 168" /&gt; The work of Haldane was an influence on [[organicism]].

Haldane also stated that a purely mechanist interpretation can not account for the characteristics of life. Haldane wrote a number of books in which he attempted to show the invalidity of both vitalism and mechanist approaches to science. Haldane explained:

{{quote|We must find a different theoretical basis of biology, based on the observation that all the phenomena concerned tend towards being so coordinated that they express what is normal for an adult organism.|&lt;ref name="Mark A. Bedau 2010, p. 95" /&gt;}}

By 1931, biologists had "almost unanimously abandoned vitalism as an acknowledged belief."&lt;ref name="Mark A. Bedau 2010, p. 95"&gt;Bedau, Mark A.; Cleland, Carol E. ''The Nature of Life: Classical and Contemporary Perspectives from Philosophy and Science'', 2010, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

== Emergentism ==
{{main|Emergentism}}

Some aspects of contemporary science make reference to [[emergence|emergent processes]]; those in which the properties of a system cannot be fully described in terms of the properties of the constituents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Schultz | first1=S.G. | title=A century of (epithelial) transport physiology: from vitalism to molecular cloning | journal=The American Journal of Physiology | volume=274 | issue=1 Pt 1 | pages=C13–23 | year=1998 | pmid=9458708 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Gilbert | first1=S.F. | last2=Sarkar | first2=S. | title=Embracing complexity: organicism for the 21st century | journal=Developmental Dynamics | volume=219 | issue=1 | pages=1–9 | year=2000 | pmid=10974666 | doi=10.1002/1097-0177(2000)9999:9999&lt;::AID-DVDY1036&gt;3.0.CO;2-A }}&lt;/ref&gt; This may be because the properties of the constituents are not fully understood, or because the interactions between the individual constituents are also important for the behavior of the system.

Whether emergence should be grouped with traditional vitalist concepts is a matter of semantic controversy.&lt;ref&gt;see "Emergent Properties" in the ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy''. online at [http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/properties-emergent/ Stanford University] for explicit discussion; briefly, some philosophers see emergentism as midway between traditional spiritual vitalism and mechanistic reductionism; others argue that, structurally, emergentism is equivalent to vitalism. See also Emmeche C (2001) Does a robot have an Umwelt? ''Semiotica'' 134: 653–693 [http://www.nbi.dk/~emmeche/cePubl/2001d.robumwelt.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Emmeche ''et al.'' (1997):

{{quote|On the one hand, many scientists and philosophers regard emergence as having only a pseudo-scientific status. On the other hand, new developments in physics, biology, psychology, and cross-disciplinary fields such as cognitive science, artificial life, and the study of non-linear dynamical systems have focused strongly on the high level 'collective behaviour' of complex systems, which is often said to be truly emergent, and the term is increasingly used to characterize such systems.|&lt;ref name="Emmeche 1997"&gt;Emmeche C (1997) Explaining Emergence: towards an ontology of levels. ''Journal for General Philosophy of Science'' [http://alf.nbi.dk/~emmeche/coPubl/97e.EKS/emerg.html available online] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061006171903/http://alf.nbi.dk/~emmeche/coPubl/97e.EKS/emerg.html |date=2006-10-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Emmeche ''et al.'' (1998) state that "there is a very important difference between the vitalists and the emergentists: the vitalist's creative forces were relevant only in organic substances, not in inorganic matter. Emergence hence is creation of new properties regardless of the substance involved." "The assumption of an extra-physical vitalis (vital force, [[entelechy]], [[élan vital]], etc.), as formulated in most forms (old or new) of vitalism, is usually without any genuine explanatory power. It has served altogether too often as an intellectual tranquilizer or verbal sedative—stifling scientific inquiry rather than encouraging it to proceed in new directions."&lt;ref&gt;[http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhicontrib2.cgi?id=dv3-69 Dictionary of the History of Ideas] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511191629/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/cgi-local/DHI/dhicontrib2.cgi?id=dv3-69 |date=2011-05-11 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mesmerism ==
{{main|Animal magnetism}}
[[File:Franz Anton Mesmer.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Franz Mesmer]] proposed the vitalist force of ''[[animal magnetism|magnétisme animal]]'' in animals with breath.]]

A popular vitalist theory of the 18th century was "[[animal magnetism]]", in the theories of [[Franz Mesmer]] (1734–1815). However, the use of the (conventional) English term ''animal magnetism'' to translate Mesmer's '''magnétisme animal''' can be misleading for three reasons:
* Mesmer chose his term to clearly distinguish his variant of ''magnetic'' force from those referred to, at that time, as ''mineral magnetism'', ''cosmic magnetism'' and ''planetary magnetism''.
* Mesmer felt that this particular force/power only resided in the bodies of humans and animals.
* Mesmer chose the word "''animal''," for its root meaning (from Latin ''animus''="breath") specifically to identify his force as a quality that belonged to all creatures with breath; viz., the animate beings: humans '''and''' animals.

Mesmer's ideas became so influential that King [[Louis XVI]] of France appointed two commissions to investigate [[mesmerism]]; one was led by [[Joseph-Ignace Guillotin]], the other, led by [[Benjamin Franklin]], included [[Jean Sylvain Bailly|Bailly]] and [[Lavoisier]]. The commissioners learned about Mesmeric theory, and saw its patients fall into fits and [[trance]]s. In Franklin's garden, a patient was led to each of five trees, one of which had been "mesmerized"; he hugged each in turn to receive the "vital fluid," but fainted at the foot of a 'wrong' one. At Lavoisier's house, four normal cups of water were held before a "sensitive" woman; the fourth produced convulsions, but she calmly swallowed the mesmerized contents of a fifth, believing it to be plain water. The commissioners concluded that "the fluid without imagination is powerless, whereas imagination without the fluid can produce the effects of the fluid."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Best | first1=M. | last2=Neuhauser | first2=D. | last3=Slavin | first3=L. | title=Evaluating Mesmerism, Paris, 1784: the controversy over the blinded placebo controlled trials has not stopped | url=http://qhc.bmjjournals.com/cgi/content/full/12/3/232 | journal=Quality &amp; safety in health care | volume=12 | issue=3 | pages=232–3 | year=2003 | pmid=12792017 | pmc=1743715 | doi=10.1136/qhc.12.3.232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Medical philosophies ==

Vitalism has a long history in [[medical]] philosophies: many [[traditional medicine|traditional healing]] practices posited that disease results from some imbalance in vital forces. In the Western tradition founded by [[Hippocrates]], these vital forces were associated with the [[four temperaments]] and [[The four humours|humours]]; Eastern traditions posited an imbalance or blocking of [[qi]] or [[prana]]. One example of a similar notion in Africa is the [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] concept of [[Ase (Yoruba)|ase]]. Today forms of vitalism continue to exist as philosophical positions or as tenets in some religious traditions.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

[[Complementary and alternative medicine]] therapies include [[energy therapy|energy therapies]],&lt;ref name="titleComplementary and Alternative Medicine – U.S. National Library of Medicine Collection Development Manual"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nlm.nih.gov/tsd/acquisitions/cdm/subjects24.html |title=Complementary and Alternative Medicine – U.S. National Library of Medicine Collection Development Manual |accessdate=2008-03-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; associated with vitalism, especially biofield therapies such as [[therapeutic touch]], [[Reiki]], external [[qi]], [[chakra]] healing and SHEN therapy.&lt;ref name="Rubik"&gt;Rubik, ''Bioenergetic Medicines'', American Medical Student Association Foundation, viewed 28 November 2006, {{cite web |url=http://www.amsa.org/ICAM/C6.doc |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060214125248/https://www.amsa.org/ICAM/C6.doc |archivedate=2006-02-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In these therapies, the "[[subtle energy]]" field of a patient is manipulated by a  practitioner. The subtle energy is held to exist beyond the electromagnetic energy produced by the heart and brain. Beverly Rubik describes the biofield as a "complex, dynamic, extremely weak EM field within and around the human body...."&lt;ref name="Rubik" /&gt;

The founder of [[homeopathy]], [[Samuel Hahnemann]], promoted an immaterial, vitalistic view of disease: "...they are solely spirit-like (dynamic) derangements of the spirit-like power (the vital principle) that animates the human body." The view of disease as a dynamic disturbance of the immaterial and dynamic vital force is taught in many homeopathic colleges and constitutes a fundamental principle for many contemporary practising homeopaths.{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}

== Criticism ==
[[File:Pierre Mignard - Portrait de Jean-Baptiste Poquelin dit Molière (1622-1673) - Google Art Project (cropped).jpg|thumb|The 17th century French playwright [[Molière]] mocked vitalism in his 1673 play ''[[Le Malade imaginaire]]''.]]

Vitalism has sometimes been criticized as begging the question by inventing a name. [[Molière]] had famously parodied this fallacy in ''[[Le Malade imaginaire]]'', where a quack "answers" the question of "Why does [[opium]] cause sleep?" with "Because of its '''dormitive virtue''' (i.e., [[soporific]] power)."&lt;ref name="fr.wikisource.org"&gt;'' Mihi a docto doctore / Demandatur causam et rationem quare / Opium facit dormire. / A quoi respondeo, / Quia est in eo / Vertus dormitiva, / Cujus est natura / Sensus assoupire.'' [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Le_Malade_imaginaire_-_3%C3%A8me_interm%C3%A8de Le Malade imaginaire, (French Wikisource)]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Henry Huxley]] compared vitalism to stating that water is the way it is because of its "aquosity".&lt;ref name="The Physical Basis of Life"&gt;[http://aleph0.clarku.edu/huxley/comm/PMG/PBofL.html The Physical Basis of Life], ''Pall Mall Gazette'', 1869&lt;/ref&gt; His grandson [[Julian Huxley]] in 1926 compared "vital force" or ''élan vital'' to explaining a railroad locomotive's operation by its ''élan locomotif'' ("locomotive force").

Another criticism is that vitalists have failed to rule out mechanistic explanations. This is rather obvious in retrospect for [[organic chemistry]] and [[developmental biology]], but the criticism goes back at least a century. In 1912, [[Jacques Loeb]] published ''The Mechanistic Conception of Life'', in which he described experiments on how a sea urchin could have a pin for its father, as [[Bertrand Russell]] put it (''Religion and Science''). He offered this challenge:

: "... we must either succeed in producing living matter artificially, or we must find the reasons why this is impossible." (pp.&amp;nbsp;5–6)

Loeb addressed vitalism more explicitly:

: "It is, therefore, unwarranted to continue the statement that in addition to the acceleration of oxidations the beginning of individual life is determined by the entrance of a metaphysical "life principle" into the egg; and that death is determined, aside from the cessation of oxidations, by the departure of this "principle" from the body. In the case of the evaporation of water we are satisfied with the explanation given by the kinetic theory of gases and do not demand that to repeat a well-known jest of Huxley the disappearance of the "aquosity" be also taken into consideration." (pp.&amp;nbsp;14–15)

Bechtel states that vitalism "is often viewed as [[Falsifiability|unfalsifiable]], and therefore a pernicious metaphysical doctrine."&lt;ref name=Bechtel/&gt; For many scientists, "vitalist" theories were unsatisfactory "holding positions" on the pathway to mechanistic understanding. In 1967, [[Francis Crick]], the co-discoverer of the structure of [[DNA]], stated "And so to those of you who may be vitalists I would make this prophecy: what everyone believed yesterday, and you believe today, only [[Crank (person)|cranks]] will believe tomorrow."&lt;ref name="Crick"&gt;Crick, Francis (1967) ''Of Molecules and Men''; Great Minds Series Prometheus Books 2004, reviewed [http://www.mala.bc.ca/~johnstoi/reviews/crickandkurtz.htm here]. Crick's remark is cited and discussed in: Hein H (2004) [http://www.springerlink.com/content/m821384707h6h254/fulltext.pdf Molecular biology vs. organicism: The enduring dispute between mechanism and vitalism.] ''Synthese'' 20:238–253, who describes Crick's remark as "raising spectral red herrings".&lt;/ref&gt;

While many vitalistic theories have in fact been falsified, notably Mesmerism, the [[pseudoscience|pseudoscientific]] retention of untested and untestable theories continues to this day. [[Alan Sokal]] published an analysis of the wide acceptance among professional nurses of "scientific theories" of spiritual healing. (Pseudoscience and Postmodernism: Antagonists or Fellow-Travelers?).&lt;ref name="Sokal"&gt;[http://physics.nyu.edu/faculty/sokal/pseudoscience_rev.pdf Pseudoscience and Postmodernism: Antagonists or Fellow-Travelers?]&lt;/ref&gt; Use of a technique called [[therapeutic touch]] was especially reviewed by Sokal, who concluded, "nearly all the pseudoscientific systems to be examined in this essay are based philosophically on vitalism" and added that "Mainstream science has rejected vitalism since at least the 1930s, for a plethora of good reasons that have only become stronger with time."&lt;ref name="Sokal" /&gt;

Joseph C. Keating, Jr.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ncmic.com/pages/ce/seminars/speakers/keating.htm Joseph C. Keating, Jr., PhD: Biographical sketch] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060525203939/http://www.ncmic.com/pages/ce/seminars/speakers/keating.htm |date=2006-05-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt; discusses vitalism's past and present roles in [[chiropractic]] and calls vitalism "a form of [[bio-theology]]." He further explains that:

: "Vitalism is that rejected tradition in biology which proposes that life is sustained and explained by an unmeasurable, intelligent force or energy. The supposed effects of vitalism are the manifestations of life itself, which in turn are the basis for inferring the concept in the first place. This circular reasoning offers pseudo-explanation, and may deceive us into believing we have explained some aspect of biology when in fact we have only labeled our ignorance. 'Explaining an unknown (life) with an unknowable (Innate),' suggests chiropractor Joseph Donahue, 'is absurd'."&lt;ref name="keating_innate"&gt;{{citation |title=The Meanings of Innate |author=Keating, Joseph C.  |volume=46 |issue=1 |pmc=2505097 |journal=The Journal of the Canadian Chiropractic Association |year=2002 |pages=4–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keating views vitalism as incompatible with scientific thinking:

: "Chiropractors are not unique in recognizing a tendency and capacity for self-repair and auto-regulation of human physiology. But we surely stick out like a sore thumb among professions which claim to be scientifically based by our unrelenting commitment to vitalism. So long as we propound the 'One cause, one cure' rhetoric of Innate, we should expect to be met by ridicule from the wider health science community. Chiropractors can't have it both ways. Our theories cannot be both dogmatically held vitalistic constructs and be scientific at the same time. The purposiveness, consciousness and rigidity of the Palmers' Innate should be rejected."&lt;ref name="keating_innate" /&gt;

Keating also mentions Skinner's viewpoint:

: "Vitalism has many faces and has sprung up in many areas of scientific inquiry. Psychologist [[B.F. Skinner]], for example, pointed out the irrationality of attributing behavior to mental states and traits. Such 'mental way stations,' he argued, amount to excess theoretical baggage which fails to advance cause-and-effect explanations by substituting an unfathomable psychology of 'mind'."&lt;ref name="keating_innate" /&gt;

According to Williams,&lt;ref name="Williams"&gt;Williams, W. (2000) ''The [[Encyclopedia of Pseudoscience]]. From Alien Abductions to Zone Therapy''. Facts on File. Conway, D. and L. Dalton, R. Dolby, R. Duval, H. Farrell, J. Frazier, J. McMillan, J. Melton, T. O'Niell, R. Shepherd, S. Utley, W. Williams. {{ISBN|0-8160-3351-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; "today, vitalism is one of the ideas that form the basis for many pseudoscientific health systems that claim that illnesses are caused by a disturbance or imbalance of the body's vital force." "Vitalists claim to be scientific, but in fact they reject the scientific method with its basic postulates of cause and effect and of provability. They often regard subjective experience to be more valid than objective material reality."

[[Victor J. Stenger|Victor Stenger]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Medicine/Biofield.html Victor J. Stenger's site] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303202347/http://www.colorado.edu/philosophy/vstenger/Medicine/Biofield.html |date=2016-03-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; states that the term "bioenergetics" "is applied in biochemistry to refer to the readily measurable [[Biological thermodynamics|exchanges of energy]] within organisms, and between organisms and the environment, which occur by normal physical and chemical processes. This is not, however, what the new vitalists have in mind. They imagine the [[Energy (esotericism)|bioenergetic]] field as a holistic living force that goes beyond reductionist physics and chemistry."&lt;ref name=Stenger&gt;{{cite journal |last=Stenger |first=Victor J. |title=The Physics of 'Alternative Medicine': Bioenergetic Fields |journal=The Scientific Review of Alternative Medicine |date=Spring–Summer 1999 |volume=3 |issue=1 |url=http://www.sram.org/0301/bioenergetic-fields.html |authorlink=Victor_J_Stenger |access-date=2006-12-03 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061218144228/http://www.sram.org/0301/bioenergetic-fields.html |archive-date=2006-12-18 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such a field is sometimes explained as electromagnetic, though some advocates also make confused appeals to quantum physics.&lt;ref name="Rubik" /&gt; Joanne Stefanatos states that "The principles of energy medicine originate in quantum physics."&lt;ref name="Stefanatos"&gt;Stefanatos, J. 1997, ''Introduction to Bioenergetic Medicine'', Shoen, A.M. and S.G. Wynn, ''Complementary and Alternative Veterinary Medicine: Principles and Practices'', Mosby-Yearbook, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; Stenger&lt;ref name="Stenger" /&gt; offers several explanations as to why this line of reasoning may be misplaced. He explains that energy exists in discrete packets called quanta. Energy fields are composed of their component parts and so only exist when quanta are present. Therefore, energy fields are not holistic, but are rather a system of discrete parts that must obey the laws of physics. This also means that energy fields are not instantaneous. These facts of quantum physics place limitations on the infinite, continuous field that is used by some theorists to describe so-called "human energy fields".&lt;ref name="Biley"&gt;Biley, Francis C. 2005, ''Unitary Health Care: Martha Rogers' Science of Unitary Human Beings'', University of Wales College of Medicine, viewed 30 November 2006, {{cite web |url=http://medweb.uwcm.ac.uk/martha/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2006-12-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061205024515/http://medweb.uwcm.ac.uk/martha/ |archivedate=2006-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Stenger continues, explaining that the effects of EM forces have been measured by physicists as accurately as one part in a billion and there is yet to be any evidence that living organisms emit a unique field.&lt;ref name="Stenger" /&gt;

Vitalistic thinking has also been identified in the naive biological theories of children: "Recent experimental results show that a majority of preschoolers tend to choose vitalistic explanations as most plausible. Vitalism, together with other forms of intermediate causality, constitute unique causal devices for naive biology as a core domain of thought."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi=10.1016/j.tics.2004.06.004 | last1=Inagaki | first1=K. | last2=Hatano | first2=G. | year=2004 | title='Vitalistic causality in young children's naive biology.' | url=| journal=Trends Cogn Sci | volume=8 | issue=8| pages=356–62 | pmid=15335462 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Yona Friedman''' (born 5 June 1923, Budapest) is a [[Hungary|Hungarian]]-born French architect, urban planner and designer. He was influential in the late 1950s and early 1960s, best known for his theory of mobile architecture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Harris |first=William |date=19 April 2016 |title=cities in the sky: re-evaluating yona friedman |url=http://www.3ammagazine.com/3am/cities-in-the-sky-re-evaluating-yona-friedman/ |newspaper=3am |access-date=19 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Early years ==
Yona Friedman has been through the Second World War escaping the Nazi roundups and lived for about a decade in the city of [[Haifa]] in [[Israel]] before moving permanently to Paris in 1957. He became a French citizen in 1966.

In 1956, the X International Congress of Modern Architecture in Dubrovnik, his "Manifeste de l'architecture mobile" contributed to question definitely the daring will planning to architectural design and urbanism. It was during that conference, and thanks especially to the youth of the Team 10, that "mobile architecture" was coined in the sense of "mobility of living." With the example of "Ville spatiale", Friedman set out - for the first time - the principles of an architecture capable of understanding the constant changes that characterize the "social mobility" and based on "infrastructure" that provide housing. Planning rules could be created and recreated, according to the need of the inhabitants and residents. Its focus on people themselves arises from its direct experience of homeless refugees, first in European cities facing war and disaster and later in Israel, where, in the early years of the State, thousands of people landed every day, with housing problems .

== Maturity ==
In 1958, he founded the Groupe d'études de architecture mobile (GEAM), dissolved in 1962.
In 1963, he developed the idea of a city bridge and participated actively in the cultural climate and utopian architecture of the 60s known as the "Age of megastructures". Since the mid-sixties he has taught at MIT, Princeton, Harvard and Columbia universities. In the following decade he worked for the United Nations and UNESCO, through the dissemination of self-building manuals in African countries, South America and India. Despite the perennial utopian label, Friedman said: "I have always tried, in architectural studies, to develop projects that were feasible."
In 1978, he was commissioned to design the Lycée Bergson in Angers, [[France]], completed in 1981. On this occasion he published a procedure in which the distribution and arrangement of all the architectural elements were designed and decided by future users. Because even non-professionals can understand and apply his method, he wrote also howto comics.
Interest in the issue of participation has brought Friedman to architects like [[Giancarlo De Carlo]] and [[Bernard Rudofsky]].

In 1987, in Madras, India, Friedman completed the Museum of Simple Technology in which the principles of self-construction from local materials like bamboo were applied.
He also authored books dealing with technical subjects (''For a scientific architecture'', Workshop 1975), sociological (''L'architecture du survie'', L'éclat 2003) and epistemological (''L'univers erratique '', PUF 1994).
The book that best represents, however,  Friedman's ethics and spirit is perhaps "Utopies Réalisables (French for ''feasible utopias''), published in France in 1975 and also published in Italian (Quodlibet 2003) describing a project to restructure our society in a genuine democratic way, seeking to escape any elitism through the theory of the critical group. The book is also a fierce critique of the myth of global communication.
From the book: "The analysis of social utopias presented in this book implies, implicitly in the act of accusation and criticism of these two 'plagues' of our times which are: 'the state mafia' and the 'media mafia' (press, television etc.). The existence of a state mafia results from the impossibility of the classic democratic state to keep the shape once its size exceeds certain limits, and the 'media mafia' is a direct result of the same inability in global communication ( Worldwide). The Internet can be used as an example of this inability, which is not the result of technical difficulties but rather stems from the fundamental human inability to communicate universally (from all to all). The failure of these two generous utopias, democracy and the 'global communication' between men, logically leads to the formation of gangs who act on our behalf against our interests.
As well as an indictment, this book will simultaneously be an act of encouragement: the individual should be encouraged not to offer their help or their tacit consent to these two gangs. It is not a call for revolution, but a call to resistance. "

==Mobile architecture==

In 1958, Yona Friedman published his first manifesto : "Mobile architecture". It described a new kind of mobility not of the buildings, but for the inhabitants, who are given a new freedom.

Mobile architecture is the "dwelling decided on by the occupant" by way of "infrastructures that are neither determined nor determining". Mobile architecture embodies an architecture available for a "mobile society". To deal with it, the classical architect invented "the Average Man". The projects of architects in the 1950s were undertaken, according to Friedman, to meet the needs of this make-believe entity, and not as an attempt to meet the needs of the actual members of this mobile society.

The teaching of architecture was largely responsible for the "classical" architect's under-estimation of the role of the user. Furthermore, this teaching did not embrace any real theory of architecture. Friedman proposed then teaching manuals for the fundamentals of architecture for the general public.

The spatial city, which is a materialization of this theory, makes it possible for everyone to develop his or her own hypothesis. This is why, in the mobile city, buildings should :
# touch the ground over a minimum area
# be capable of being dismantled and moved
# and be alterable as required by the individual occupant.

==The Spatial City==

The Spatial City is the most significant application of "mobile architecture". It is  raised up on piles which contains inhabited volumes, fitted inside some of the "voids", alternating with other unused volumes, making it look aesthetically pleasant. The basis of its design is that of trihedral elements which operate as "neighbourhoods" where dwellings are distributed without a price.

This structure introduces a kind of merger between countryside and city (compare to [[Paolo Soleri]]'s [[Arcology]] concept) and may span:
* certain unavailable sites,
* areas where building is not possible or permitted (expanses of water, marshland),
* areas that have already been built upon (an existing city),
* above farmland.

This spanning technique which includes container structures ushers in a new development in town-planning. Raised plans increase the original area of the city becoming three-dimensional. The tiering of the spatial city on several independent levels, one on top of the other, determines "spatial town-planning" both from the functional and from the aesthetic viewpoint. The lower level may be earmarked for public life and for premises designed for community services as well as pedestrian areas. The piles contain the vertical means of transport (lifts, staircases). The superposition of levels should make it possible to build a whole industrial city, or a residential or commercial city, on the same site. In this way, the Spatial City forms what Yona Friedman would call an "artificial [[topography]]". This grid suspended in space outlines a new cartography of the terrain with the help of a continuous and indeterminate homogeneous network with a major positive outcome: this modular grid would authorize the limitless growth of the city.

The spaces in this grid are rectangular and habitable modular "voids", with an average area of 25-35 square meters. Conversely, the form of the volumes included within the grid depends solely on the occupant, and their configuration set with a "Flatwriter" in the grid is completely free. Only one half of the spatial city would be occupied. The "fillings" which correspond to the dwellings only actually take up 50% of the three-dimensional lattice, permitting the light to spread freely in the spatial city. This introduction of elements on a three-dimensional grid with several levels on piles permits a changeable occupancy of the space by means of the convertibility of the forms and their adaptation to multiple uses.

In Yona Friedman's own words "The city, as a mechanism, is thus nothing other than a labyrinth : a configuration of points of departure, and terminal points, separated by obstacles".
