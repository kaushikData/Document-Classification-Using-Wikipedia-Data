The '''Bantenese''' are a distinct subgroup of the [[Sundanese people]], native to [[Banten|Banten Province]] on the island of [[Java]]. The area of Banten province corresponds more or less with the area of the former [[Banten Sultanate]], a Banten [[nation state]] that precedes [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/19980880/Suku_Bangsa_di_Provinsi_Banten |title=Suku Bangsa di Provinsi Banten |author=Anugerah Bintang |publisher=Academia |date= |accessdate=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book "The Sultanate of Banten", Guillot Claude writes on page 35: “These estates, owned by the Bantenese of Chinese origin, were concentrated around the village of Kelapadua.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

==2010 Population Census==
According to the 2010 Population Census carried out by the Central Bureau of Statistics Indonesia, the Bantenese people along with the [[Baduy people]] are categorized under the Native Bantenese people with a total of 4,657,784 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sp2010.bps.go.id/index.php/site?id=36&amp;wilayah=Banten |title=Provinsi Banten |publisher=Badan Pusat Statistik |date=2010 |accessdate=2017-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KSBADB"/&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:Landlieden van achter Bantam, 1596, anonymous, 1597 - 1598.jpg|thumb|left|Bantenese people before the establishment of [[Banten Sultanate]].]]
 
The origins of the Bantenese people; which are closely related to the [[Banten Sultanate]], are different from the [[Cirebonese people]] whom are not part of the [[Sundanese people]] nor the [[Javanese people]] (unless it is from the result of a mixture of two major cultures, namely Sundanese and Javanese). The Bantenese people along with the [[Baduy people]] (Kanekes) are essentially sub-ethnics of the [[Sundanese people]] that occupies the former region of the [[Banten Sultanate]] (region of Bantam Residency after the abolishment and annexation by the [[Dutch East Indies]]). After the formation of the [[Banten Province]] only did people began to regard the Bantenese as a group of people with a culture and language of their own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kebudayaanindonesia.net/kebudayaan/1113/suku-banten |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170322014235/http://kebudayaanindonesia.net/kebudayaan/1113/suku-banten |dead-url=yes |archive-date=22 March 2017 |title=Suku Banten |publisher=Kebudayaan Indonesia |date=26 August 2013 |accessdate=2017-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
[[File:Linguistic map West Java.png|thumb|right|Language map of western Java (provinces of [[Banten]], [[West Java]] and [[Jakarta]] capital region.)]]
The most dominant language is [[Sundanese language|Sundanese]].&lt;ref name="ethnologue.com"&gt;[http://www.ethnologue.com/show_map.asp?name=IDJ&amp;seq=20 Language maps of Indonesia (Java and Bali)&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ECAI - Pacific Language Mapping"&gt;[http://www.ecai.org/austronesiaweb/AustronesiaASP/PacificMapLeaf.asp?mapleafid=L039 ECAI - Pacific Language Mapping&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The indigenous people living in Banten Province speak a Sundanese dialect derived from archaic [[Sundanese language]]. The dialect is classified as informal or harsh layer in modern Sundanese language,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://budaya-indonesia.org/Bahasa-Sunda-Banten/ |title=Bahasa Sunda Banten |publisher=Perpustakaan Digital Budaya Indonesia |date=2014 |accessdate=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; having different layers as [[Javanese language]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Due to the influence of the Javanese culture during the reign of the Islamic Mataram kingdom, the Sundanese language - especially in the [[Parahyangan]] area - have different layers starting from the most formal, or "halus/lemes" version, to the everyday "loma/lancaran" version and the informal or harsh version. Mataram Sultanate tried to take control over Java island, including Banten territory covering the whole West Java region. But the [[Sultanate of Banten]] could defend its territory except Parahyangan area. In the mountainous regions and most of present-day Banten, the loma version of Sundanese language is the most dominant. By contrast, this version is considered "harsh" by people from Parahyangan. [[Bantenese language]] is commonly used especially in the southern region of [[Banten]] such as [[Pandeglang Regency]] and [[Lebak Regency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.metrotvnews.com/jabar/peristiwa/lKYm0rXK-bahasa-dan-sastra-sunda-banten-terancam-punah |title=Bahasa dan Sastra Sunda Banten Terancam Punah |author=Batur Parisi |publisher=Metro TV News |date=16 March 2017 |accessdate=2017-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, around Serang and Cilegon, Banten Province, a dialect of the Javanese language, the [[Banyumasan language|Banyumasan]] is also spoken by about 500,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

  | accessdate =1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; And, in Northern part of Tangerang, Indonesian language with Betawi dialect is also used by Betawi immigrants. Besides Sundanese, Javanese and [[Betawi language|Betawi]] dialect, Indonesian language is also widely spoken especially by other ethnic immigrants from other parts of Indonesia especially in urban centers.

==Religion==
Those who considered themselves as Bantenese are generally practicing Muslims, which is due to being inseparable from a strong Islamic cultural background. This case is also closely related to the history of [[Banten Sultanate]] as one of the largest Islamic kingdom in the island of [[Java]]. Besides that, the artistry in Banten region also portrays Islamic activities of its society, such as art Rampak Bedug from [[Pandeglang Regency]].&lt;ref name="PRBDTSKPMS"/&gt; Even so, [[Banten Province]] is a multi-ethnic society consisting of various ethnics and religions.&lt;ref name="KSBADB"/&gt; Adherents of other faiths from various non-indigenous ethnic groups live alongside each other peacefully in this region, such as the [[Benteng Chinese]] community in [[Tangerang]] and the [[Baduy people]] that practices [[Sunda Wiwitan]] in Kanekes, Leuwidamar, [[Lebak Regency]].

==Culture==

The pattern and motifs of Bantenese [[batik]] is the illumination of decorative design that have been studied by the [[Banten]] government as part of the framework of rediscovering ornamental motifs from traditional Bantenese houses. These decorative designs came about as a result of the reconstructions from the excavations made by the National Archaeology and the Faculty of Literature, [[Universitas Indonesia]] since 1976. The decorative designs are then decided by the [[Banten]] governor in 2003.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2770">The '''Circolo Speleologico Romano''' ('''CSR''') is an [[Italy|Italian]], [[non-profit]] [[speleological]] [[organization]] dedicated to the exploration, [[research]], and conservation of [[caves]]. The CSR  is one of the oldest caving groups in [[Italy]]. Its activity has contributed to the birth and the increase of the Italian [[Speleology]]

==History==
The Circolo Speleologico Romano (CSR) was founded on the 5th of July 1904 by [[Guido Cora]], the illustrious [[geographer]] and brave [[mountain]] climber, Baron [[Carlo Franchetti]], [[Alessandro Datti]] and others. Immediately the CSR established relationships with other [[Europe]]an groups, especially Swiss, French and Belgium sharing the exploration of the [[Abruzzo]] region (Luppa’s cave, Val de Varri’s Cave) and in France. The first major exploration campaigns outside Italy, of the [[Anatolia]] [[caves]], began after the First World War leading to important biological discoveries. In this period the bio-spelological activity received a strong acceleration especially due to the two associates Patrizi and Cerruti. More than 200 new species of troglobites carry the name of CSR associates. Since the beginning of the exploration activity all the data collected about each [[cave]] has been organized in the cave cadastre. In the 90s the regional [[cave]] cadastre was passed to the [[Federazione speleologica del Lazio]]. In 1924 the club published its first bulletin, detailing the explorations and the scientific activities of its associates. This bulletin (renamed Notiziario del Circolo Speleologico Romano in 1946) is exchanged with the publications of similar organizations in more than 40 nations around the [[world]], continually expanding the social library of the association. In 1954 for its merits in scientific field, to the fulfilment of its 50 year of activity, the CSR was named "Ente Morale" by decree of the [[President]] of the [[Italian Republic]] [[Luigi Einaudi]].
In the 1960s the CSR began to mount large international expeditions (1962 Gouffre Berger in [[France]], 1963 in [[Lebanon]], in 1964 Ojo Guareña in [[Spain]] and then [[Poland]], [[Turkey]], [[Albania]]. Since 1969 its research in [[Chiapas]]  (southern [[Mexico]]) has been particularly relevant, where it has explored and surveyed more than 60&amp;nbsp;km of new caves. The bio-speleological results of these activities are published in three volumes of the [[Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei]] with the title “Subterranean [[Fauna]] of [[Mexico]]”.
To commemorate the 100th year of activity of the Circolo Speleologico Romano [[Poste Italiane]]  has produced a special stamp in 3.5 million of pieces.

== Birth rates and fertility == 
In 2016 a total of 64,984 live births were recorded in Bulgaria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsi.bg/en/content/6623/live-births-districts-municipalities-and-sex|title=Live births by districts, municipalities and sex - National statistical institute|website=www.nsi.bg}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The country has a crude birth rate of 9.1‰. 

Seventy years ago (in the census of 1946), Bulgaria had a crude birth rate of 25,6‰. Ethnic [[Bulgarians]] (23,3‰) had a much lower crude birth rate compared to the two largest minorities: [[Turks in Bulgaria| Turks]] (40,9‰) and [[Romani people in Bulgaria |Roma]] (47,2‰).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://geoproblems.eu/wp-content/uploads/2016/02/2011_12/4_ilieva.pdf |title= Report|website=geoproblems.eu}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, it is unlikely that this difference continued since then, as birth rates in the Balkan countries dropped sharply. 

Bulgaria has a low [[total fertility rate]] of 1.54 children per woman (at the end of 2016). This is up significantly from the late 1990s, but still below replacement and not enough to prevent further population decline, especially with emigration. Provinces with large Roma populations (for example [[Sliven Province | Sliven]], [[Montana Province | Montana]] and [[Yambol Province | Yambol]]) tend to have higher fertility rates (and higher death rates) compared to other areas, whereas Turkish fertility is similar to the Bulgarian majority.

== Demographic policies ==
The progressive decrease of the Bulgarian population is hindering economic growth and welfare improvement, and the management measures taken to mitigate the negative consequences do not address the essence of the problem. The Government Program for the period 2017 - 2021 is the first  one that aims at overturning the trend. The program also identifies the priority means for achieving this goal: measures to increase the birth rate, reduce youth emigration, and build up regulatory and institutional capacity to implement a modern immigration policy tailored to the needs of the Bulgarian business.&lt;ref&gt;L.

Note that the distinction between [[Sarakatsani]] and Greeks, and between Vlachs and Romanians, is fluid. Sarakatsani were counted as Greeks in the 1900, 1920, 1926, 1934, and 1965 censuses.

Since the last two censuses (2001 and 2011) provide widely divergent results, they are both shown in the table below. It is noteworthy that over a fifth of the population chose not to respond to this question in the 2011 census.

==Migration==
{{main|Immigration to Bulgaria}}
In relation to internal migration, according to the 1910 census, 300,000 or almost 10% of the ethnic Bulgarians were born in another Bulgarian municipality than the one they were enumerated in. The same data shows that the foreign-born ethnic Bulgarians numbered 78,000, or 2% of them, most numerous of whom were the 61,000 [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]]-born, 9,000 Romanian-born and by less than 2,000 [[Austro-Hungarian Empire|Austro-Hungarian]], Serbian and Russian-born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://statlib.nsi.bg:8181/en/lister.php?iid=DO-010000566&amp;page=62|title=iLib - Lister|date=6 February 2017|accessdate=15 October 2017|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170206185503/http://statlib.nsi.bg:8181/en/lister.php?iid=DO-010000566&amp;page=62|archivedate=6 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; By the 1926 census, there had been 253,000 refugees with granted households and land or citizenship but with many more in towns of uncertain number. 35% came from [[Eastern Thrace]], 30% came from [[Aegean Macedonia]], another 18% from [[Western Thrace]], 8% from [[Dobruja]], 4% from the [[Western Outlands]], 3% from [[Asia Minor]], and 2% from [[Vardar Macedonia]]. They constituted 6% of the country's population. In 1940, 70,000 Bulgarians were exchanged from [[Northern Dobruja]]. The total number of refugees in 1878-1940 is estimated at between 700,000 and 1,200,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://docplayer.net/35763499-Communities-identities-and-migrations-in-southeast-europe.html|title=Communities, Identities and Migrations in Southeast Europe - PDF|website=docplayer.net|accessdate=24 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bulgarian children constitute the majority of all children in 23 out of 28 provinces. They constitute more than ninety percent of all children in two provinces: [[Sofia | Sofia (city)]] (92%) and [[Pernik Province]] (90%).

Turkish children constitute the majority in [[Kardzhali Province]] (68% of all children) and [[Razgrad Province]] (50% of all children); they also constitute the largest group of all children in [[Silistra Province]] (43%). 

Roma children constitute 12% of all children in Bulgaria and more than a quarter in three provinces: [[Montana Province | Montana]] (29%), [[Sliven Province | Sliven]] (28%) and [[Yambol Province | Yambol ]] (27%). 

=== Age structure ===

Bulgaria is ageing rapidly, especially in some remote rural areas.

The ageing of the population leads to an increase of the median age. The median age is 43.6 as of 2017, up from 40.4 years in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsi.bg/sites/default/files/files/pressreleases/Population2017_en_R5PBSJP.pdf |title=POPULATION AND DEMOGRAPHIC PROCESSES IN 2017 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-05-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

== Sex ratio ==
Of the total 7,364,570 as of 2011, 3 586 571 are [[male]]s and 3,777,999 are [[female]]s, or there are 1053 women for 1,000 men.

== Education ==
{{main article|Education in Bulgaria}}
Over 98% of the population is literate, the males being more literate than the females.

According to the 2011 census, about 112,778 people aged nine or more are [[illiterate]]. There are considerable differences in the share of illiterate persons amongst the three main ethnic groups. Amongst the Bulgarian ethnic group the share of illiterate is 0.5%, amongst the Turkish - 4.7% and amongst the Roma ethnic group - 11.8%. &lt;ref&gt;2011 census results [http://www.nsi.bg/census2011/PDOCS2/Census2011final_en.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt; About 81 thousand people aged seven or more never visited school. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sociobrains.com/website/w1465/file/repository/14_20_Sonya_Ilieva_Predominating_risk_groups_in_Bulgarian_society.pdf |title=Risk report |website=sociobrains.com |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Unemployment ==
The median unemployment for the country in 2011 was 10.1%.

The number of unemployed people declined to 207 thousand people (or around 6.2% of the population) in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;Unemployed and unemployment rates - national level; statistical regions; districts [http://www.nsi.bg/en/content/6503/unemployed-and-unemployment-rates-national-level-statistical-regions-districts]&lt;/ref&gt;  

Most unemployed people are aged 15 to 24 years old.

The [[unemployment rate]] in rural areas (around 10.0%) is nearly two times higher than the unemployment rate in urban areas (approximately 5.1%). 

[[Vidin Province]] has the highest unemployment rate with almost one fifth of its labour force being unemployed. The provinces of [[Shumen Province | Shumen]] (15.9%), [[Silistra Province | Silistra]] (12.5%) and [[Targovishte Province | Targovishte]] (12.4%) have also very high unemployment rates.

== Private ownership ==
According to [[Eurostat]], 82.3% per cent of the population live in privately owned and owner-occupied homes, ranking it as 12th [[List of countries by home ownership rate|highest in ownership]] globally.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://appsso.eurostat.ec.europa.eu/nui/show.do?query=BOOKMARK_DS-057102_QID_684D63DF_UID_-3F171EB0&amp;layout=TIME,C,X,0;GEO,L,Y,0;INCGRP,L,Z,0;HHTYP,L,Z,1;TENURE,L,Z,2;INDICATORS,C,Z,3;&amp;zSelection=DS-057102INDICATORS,OBS_FLAG;DS-057102INCGRP,TOTAL;DS-057102TENURE,OWN;DS-057102HHTYP,TOTAL;&amp;rankName1=HHTYP_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankName2=INDICATORS_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankName3=INCGRP_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankName4=TENURE_1_2_-1_2&amp;rankName5=TIME_1_0_0_0&amp;rankName6=GEO_1_2_0_1&amp;sortR=ASC_0&amp;sortC=ASC_-1_FIRST&amp;rStp=&amp;cStp=&amp;rDCh=&amp;cDCh=&amp;rDM=true&amp;cDM=true&amp;footnes=false&amp;empty=false&amp;wai=false&amp;time_mode=NONE&amp;time_most_recent=false&amp;lang=EN&amp;cfo=%23%23%23%2C%23%23%23.%23%23%23|title=Eurostat - Data Explorer - Distribution of population by tenure status, type of household and income group|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=[[Eurostat]]|access-date=23 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is down from a recent peak of 87.6% in 2008, and has been steadily falling since.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The number of Internet users has increased rapidly since 2000—from 430,000 their number grew to 1.55&amp;nbsp;million in 2004, and 3.4&amp;nbsp;million (48 per cent penetration rate) in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.internetworldstats.com/eu/bg.htm |title=Bulgaria Internet Usage Stats and Market Report |publisher=Internetworldstats.com |date=30 June 2010 |accessdate=20 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bulgaria has the third-fastest average Broadband Internet speed in the world after South Korea and Romania with an average speed of 1,611 KBps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sofiaecho.com/2011/09/21/1161236_bulgaria-ranks-third-in-global-internet-speed-survey|title=Bulgaria ranks third in global Internet speed survey|publisher=[[The Sofia Echo]]|date=21 September 2011|accessdate=8 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.itu.int/ITU-D/ict/facts/2011/material/ICTFactsFigures2011.pdf |title=The World in 2011 – Facts and Figures |date=February 2012 |publisher=[[International Telecommunication Union]] |accessdate=27 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Currently there are three active mobile phone operators—[[Mobiltel|Mtel]], [[Telenor]] and [[Vivacom]], Mtel is the largest one with 5.2 million users as of 2010,&lt;ref name="managerblitz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.manager.bg/broi-132/menidzhmant/%E2%80%9Cm-tel-blits-s-andreas-mayerhofer|title="М-Тел" блиц с Андреас Майерхофер - списание МЕНИДЖЪР|date=23 April 2012|website=Manager.bg|accessdate=24 August 2017|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120423010908/http://www.manager.bg/broi-132/menidzhmant/%E2%80%9Cm-tel-blits-s-andreas-mayerhofer|archivedate=23 April 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Telenor has 3,9 million as of 2007 and Vivacom over 1 million{{Citation needed|date=April 2017}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3154">The '''Designated Suppliers Program''' ('''DSP''') is a [[procurement]] standard proposed by the [[Worker Rights Consortium]] and United Students Against Sweatshops. The program was designed to promote the use by [[US universities]] of suppliers that make use of a defined set of fair labor practices. It was established in response to the widespread use of [[sweatshop]] labor in the production of university-branded clothing and other goods.  A full description of the DSP, as it currently stands, can be accessed [http://www.workersrights.org/DSP/Designated%20Suppliers%20Program%20-%20Revised.pdf here].&lt;ref&gt;Appelbaum, Richard and Dreier, Peter. [http://www.workersrights.org/press/theNation_6-1-06_DSP%20Campus%20Breakthrough.pdf "Campus Breakthrough on Sweatshop Labor"], ''The Nation'', June 1, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The DSP has been endorsed in principle by a number of universities in the US, and is under active consideration by others.

Attempt to convince the administration at the [[University of North Carolina]] resulted in a sit-in by members of the [[UNC Student Action with Workers Designated Suppliers Program Movement|UNC chapter of Student Action with Workers]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2050">'''Frejon''' (From ''Feijão'', which is the Portuguese word for beans) is a coconut milk and bean soup which is eaten especially during [[Holy Week]] by a selection of Christians, mostly Catholics, across the world. Countries where Frejon is popular include Brazil and [[Nigeria]] (especially among [[Yoruba people|Yoruba]] who returned to Nigeria from Brazil at the abolition of the slave trade, and settled in what is known as the "Brazilian Quarters" in Lagos Island), and also [[Sierra Leone]] on [[Good Friday]], or for functions such as weddings.&lt;ref name="mcbook"&gt;{{cite book|last=Webb|first=Lois Sinaiko|title=Multicultural Cookbook of Life-Cycle Celebrations|publisher=[[ABC-CLIO]]|date= 2000|series=Cookbooks for Students Series|isbn=1-57356-290-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because dairy foods and flesh meat (beef, pork, goat) are strictly forbidden on Good Friday, this dish is a suitable accompliment to non-dairy foods such as fried fish and peppered [[snail]].

The frejons consumed in Nigeria and West Africa are puddings made of black beans cooked slowly overnight over a wood or charcoal fire, and then mixed with coconut milk to form a thick, sweet, smooth pudding.   In certain countries the dish is flavored with cocoa.&lt;ref name="mcbook"/&gt; The beans are boiled to a thick soft paste and blended with coconut milk. Frejon is often served with fish stew, peppered snail and [[Garri]] Ijebu.

==Other variations==

* Pepper, crayfish, salt and tomatoes can be added to the mashed beans and coconut mixture.
* Sweet frejon may also be achieved by adding sugar. It may also be chilled until it hardens, or thinned to make a drink which is served with biscuits.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3260">The '''Garanganze''', '''Yeke''' or '''Bayeke''' are a people of [[Katanga Province|Katanga]], in the [[Democratic Republic of Congo]]. They established the [[Yeke Kingdom]] under the warrior-king [[Msiri]], who dominated the southern part of [[Central Africa]] from 1850 to 1891 and controlled the trade route between [[Angola]] and [[Zanzibar]] from his capital, at [[Bunkeya]].

Msiri and his people were originally [[Nyamwezi people|Nyamwezi]] traders from around the [[Tabora]] who migrated to Katanga to reach the source of [[copper]], [[ivory trade|ivory]] and [[slaves]] to trade. They took over and merged with a Wasanga chieftainship and established a powerful base by conquering neighbouring tribes.

In 1891, Msiri was killed by the [[Stairs Expedition]] sent by King [[Leopold II of Belgium]] to take possession of Katanga for his [[Congo Free State]]. Many of the Yeke dispersed, with some settling in the [[Luapula River|Luapula]] Valley and the western shores of [[Lake Mweru]] around the Garanganze Missions of the [[Plymouth Brethren]], led by [[Dan Crawford (missionary)|Dan Crawford]]. Others who had been regarded as the Yeke were reabsorbed into the Wasanga ethnic group. Consequently, the Yeke or Garanganze now number only about 20,000 and speak [[Kisanga]] and [[Swahili language|Swahili]], Yeke (Kiyeke) now being a language that is used only for ceremonial occasions.&lt;ref name=Aleph&gt;[http://aleph2at.free.fr/index.html?http://aleph2at.free.fr/hommes/yeke/general.htm ''De l'Aleph à l'@: Les Peuples Yeke''] website accessed 7 May 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mwami Mwenda chieftainship==
The Garanganze still maintain the '''Mwami Mwenda''' [[tribal chief|chieftainship]] at Bunkeya, after it was exiled by the Belgian colonial authorities for some years to the Lufoi River. The chieftainship is named in honour of Msiri whose full name was ''Mwenda Msiri Ngelengwa Shitambi''. The current chief who was enthroned in 1997 is Mwami Mwenda VIII, named Mwenda-Bantu Godefroid Munonga.&lt;ref name=Kingmsiri&gt;[http://www.kingmsiri.com/index2.htm ''Mwami Msiri, King of Garanganze''] Website accessed 7 May 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 

The official history of the Garanganze claims that the chieftainship survived despite neglect and opposition from the Belgian colonial authorities. However other sources say that the Belgians, whose first treaty in Katanga was with Mwami Mwenda II Mukanda-Bantu whom they had installed after killing Msiri, used the chieftainship to bolster colonial rule, conferring on the chiefs an importance which the Yeke, a relatively small tribe, did not warrant from their numbers.&lt;ref name=Aleph/&gt;

[[Godefroid Munongo|Mwami Mwenda VI Godefroid Munonga]] was involved in the Katanga secession crisis and was appointed Minister of the Interior of the breakaway state. After Katanga was reunited with the Congo, he was imprisoned by [[Mobutu]] for a few years and after his release he was enthroned as chief in 1976.&lt;ref name=Kingmsiri/&gt;

{{Women in society sidebar}}
All [[ethnic groups in Sri Lanka]] have many distinctions regarding the '''roles of the sexes'''.
[[Sri Lanka]] was the first nation in the world to elect a female head of state, [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]]. Bandaranaike won the election in 1960 after [[S. W. R. D. Bandaranaike|S.W.R.D. Bandaranaike]], the preceding leader who was also her husband, was murdered by a spy.

While Sri Lanka relatively excels when it comes to gender equality indices, there are still many underlying issues pertaining to [[Gender Inequality in Sri Lanka|gender inequality in Sri Lanka]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gender Inequality Index (GII) {{!}} Human Development Reports|url = http://hdr.undp.org/en/content/gender-inequality-index-gii|website = hdr.undp.org|accessdate = 2015-10-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many '''[[Women in Sri Lanka]]''' choose to work, while some choose to work at home and care for children. In families relying on [[agriculture]], women are in charge of [[weeding]] and help with the [[harvest]]. Among poor families, women also perform full-time work for upper class individuals. Moreover, the man's role used to be seen as providing his family with [[material support]] by looking after his business. 

At the center of the hierarchy are children, who mix freely and receive a great deal of [[affection]] from both sexes. Among the middle- and upper-income classes, education of children may last into their early twenties, and women may mix with males or even take on jobs that were in the past reserved for men. For poorer income children, they may go to work at an earlier age.

==Gender inequality==
{{Main|Gender inequality in Sri Lanka}}
In comparison to other countries in the region, Sri Lanka is ranked well on several [[Gender inequality|gender equality]] indices. However, there are also some sources that question the validity of these indices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Towards a Fresh Start in Measuring Gender Equality: A Contribution to the Debate|url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1080/14649880600768660|journal = Journal of Human Development|date = 1 July 2006|issn = 1464-9888|pages = 275–283|volume = 7|issue = 2|doi = 10.1080/14649880600768660|first = A. Geske|last = Dijkstra}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, globally, Sri Lanka ranks relatively low on gender equality indices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = United Nations Statistics Division - Demographic and Social Statistics|url = http://unstats.un.org/unsd/demographic/products/indwm/default.htm|website = unstats.un.org|accessdate = 9 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Overall, this pattern of social history that disempowers females produces a cycle of undervaluing females, providing only secondary access to health care and schooling and thus less opportunities to take on high-level jobs or training. In a study by Dr. Elaine Enarson, this cycle in turn worsens the issue of low political participation and social rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Gender and natural disasters|url = http://www.ilo.org/employment/Whatwedo/Publications/WCMS_116391/lang--en/index.htm|website = www.ilo.org|date = 1 September 2000|accessdate = 2 November 2015|first = Elaine Enarson, Crisis Response and Reconstruction,|last = ILO}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Peachtree-Pine shelter.jpg|thumb| The [[Peachtree-Pine shelter]] in [[Atlanta|Atlanta, Georgia]]]]
'''Homeless shelters''' are a type of homeless service agency which provide temporary residence for [[homelessness|homeless]] individuals and families. Shelters exist to provide residents with safety and protection from exposure to the weather while simultaneously reducing the [[environmental impact]] on the community. They are similar to, but distinguishable from, various types of [[emergency shelter]]s, which are typically operated for specific circumstances and populations—fleeing natural disasters or abusive social circumstances. Extreme weather conditions create problems similar to [[disaster management]] scenarios, and are handled with [[warming center]]s, which typically operate for short durations during adverse weather.

== Homeless population ==
[[File:The Good Shepherd, a Salvation Army homeless shelter on Jarvis Street, 2013 10 21.jpg|thumb|left|200px|The Good Shepherd, a Salvation Army homeless shelter in Toronto.]]
===Health issues===
Hundreds of homeless individuals die each year from diseases, untreated medical conditions, lack of nutrition, starvation, and freezing to death. In a mild-wintered San Francisco in 1998, homeless people were purportedly 58% more likely to perish than the general population. In [[New Orleans]], approximately 10,000 homeless were unaccounted for after [[Hurricane Katrina]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=bwh&amp;AN=18673816&amp;site=ehost-live|title = N.O.

In [[Washington, D.C.]], statistics indicate that 63% of homeless people suffer from a lack of access to regular bathing.

=== LGBT people ===
The [[LGBT]] homeless are at increased risk of violence compared to other groups.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; [[Transgender]] people are also at danger of being placed into the incorrect shelters. In some cases, transgender women can be turned away from women's shelters.&lt;ref name=":19"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.13abc.com/home/headlines/Transgender-woman-upset-after-being-kicked-out-of-shelter-309397841.html|title = Transgender Woman Upset After Being Kicked Out of Shelter|last = |first = |date = 25 June 2015|work = 13 ABC|access-date = 17 December 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This can place their safety at risk.&lt;ref name=":19" /&gt;

=== Men ===
In a national survey conducted in the United States the findings showed that of the surveyed homeless, two-thirds are men and most likely to be single adults between the ages of 25 and 54.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = https://www.nhchc.org/wp-content/uploads/2012/03/June2001HealingHands.pdf|title = Single Males: The Homeless Majority|last = |first = |date = June 2001|journal = Healing Hands|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 17 December 2015|page = 1|volume = 5|issue = 3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Women ===
Women are at great risk of both homelessness and poverty because they are most likely to bear child-rearing responsibilities and vulnerable to become victims of family members or “intimate partners.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=pbh&amp;AN=48169023&amp;site=ehost-live|title = 'Like a Prison!': Homeless Women's Narratives of Surviving Shelter|last = Deward|first = Sarah L.|date = March 2010|journal = Journal of Sociology &amp; Social Welfare|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 22 July 2015|last2 = Moe|first2 = Angela M.|issue = 1|volume = 37|pages = 115–135}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a survey conducted in the 2013 showed that in an emergency shelter in [[Texas]], women were the majority population, though this is not a trend reflected in the majority of the country.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.news-journal.com/news/2013/feb/05/survey-more-women-than-men-in-area-homeless-shelte/|title = Survey: More Women Than Men in Area Homeless Shelters|last = Ward|first = Angela|date = 5 February 2013|work = Longview News-Journal|access-date = 17 December 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeless women who are of childbearing age also face unique [[Menstrual hygiene day|hygiene issues]] because of [[menstruation]].&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.huf[21]fingtonpost.com/2015/01/14/homeless-women-tampons_n_6465230.html|title = For Homeless Women, Getting Their Period is One of the Most Difficult Challenges|last = Goldberg|first = Eleanor|date = 14 January 2015|work = The Huffington Post|access-date = 22 July 2015|via = }}{{dead link|date=December 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Homeless shelters have noted that both [[tampon]]s and [[Sanitary napkin|sanitary pads]] “top the list of needs at shelters” because of their high cost and because they are not donated often.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Alternative models and management philosophies ==

=== Housing first practice===
The homeless shelters across the country act merely as emergency shelter systems that can only hold a fraction of the rapidly increasing homeless population. The Housing First practice provides an alternative to the current network of homeless shelters. The program targets the large problem within the United States which is a lack of affordable housing.  This methodology attempts to place homeless families back into independent living situations as quickly as possible. The Housing First practice has achieved success due the fact that homeless families are more responsive to social services support once when they are in their own housing. It provides crisis intervention, affordable rental housing, and gives each family a grace period of six months to a year of social service to allow the family to get back on their feet.  The effectiveness of this concept is that it assists homeless families in identifying their needs and recognizing the choices they must make. From this point families can create better options for themselves and plan strategies for living on their own.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.beyondshelter.org/aaa_initiatives/ending_homelessness.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

===Empowerment model===
Some shelters propose “empowerment models,” where instead of serving “clients," they empower “participants.” The goal is to become agents in their own futures and destinies.{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

Such models tend to focus on assisting participants to access their rights and to fulfill their responsibilities as citizens. Sometimes this includes contributing financially towards the provision of the shelters they are residing in. In Australia, legislation requires those residing in Government funded shelters to contribute a figure similar to 25% of their own income, in return for support and accommodation. Consequently, many shelters in Australia rely on participant contributions for as much as 20% of their budgets.&lt;ref&gt;Najidah Association Inc. Annual report, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religious shelters===
Another model is Dorothy's Place in Salinas, CA. It is actually a day center which coordinates with multiple church and synagogue congregations to link up to night time shelter opportunities. Dorothy's Place is closely affiliated with faith based community service groups, including the Franciscan Worker and Companions of the Way Interfaith Dharma community. They propose that they are in search of “possibilitarians,” a theme resonating with the prominent ministry of “possibility thinking” promoted by [[Reformed Church of America]] minister [[Robert H. Schuller|Robert Schuller]].

The Rescue Mission in [[Milwaukee|Milwaukee, Minnesota]] is an extreme example of helping the homeless through religion. In order to receive a free meal at the Rescue Mission, residents must first attend a [[Christian]] prayer service.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.milwaukeemag.com/2015/07/13/food-for-the-soul-homeless-milwaukee/|title = Food for the Soul|last = Hrodey|first = Matt|date = 13 July 2015|work = Milwaukee Magazine|access-date = 23 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Salvation Army]] is a social support service organization that also functions as a religious group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=f5h&amp;AN=45223892&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Help for the Helpers|last = Young|first = Ben|date = November 2009|journal = Georgia Trend|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 24 July 2015|volume = 25|issue = 3|page = 18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The programs of the Salvation Army are designed to assist women, children, elderly men, families, and those who are battling drug addictions.

=== Vehicles as shelter ===
Around the late 2000s, in [[Santa Barbara, California|Santa Barbara]] and other areas in [[California]], groups of recently homeless began to camp out in their cars in [[parking lot]]s with the coordinated support of a local non-profit group.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Homelessness|last = Fleck|first = Carole|publisher = Greenhaven Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780737759396|location = Farmington Hills, Michigan|pages = 31–32|chapter = Is Homelessness a Serious Problem?}}&lt;/ref&gt; These individuals and families were often unable to afford rent or [[Mortgage loan|mortgage]], but still had jobs, cars, insurance and other types of support structures.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In Santa Barbara, an estimated 55 individuals camped out every night in various private and public lots, some reserved for women only.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; As more people began to camp in their vehicles, California cities began to  pass laws against sleeping in vehicles, like the 2013 ordinance passed in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]].&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.paloaltoonline.com/news/2014/11/18/palo-alto-strikes-down-car-camping-ban|title = Palo Alto Strikes Down Car-Camping Ban|last = Sheyner|first = Gennady|date = 18 November 2014|work = Palo Alto Online|access-date = 23 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many of these laws in different municipalities were later struck down in higher courts as [[Constitutionality|unconstitutional]],&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; like the [[Los Angeles]] ban which was judged by the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit|9th Circuit Court of Appeals]] in 2014.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.scpr.org/news/2015/07/23/53164/homeless-living-in-cars-baffle-neighborhoods/|title = Number of Homeless Living in Cars, RVs in LA Grows|last = Tam|first = Susanica|date = 23 July 2015|work = Southern California Public Radio|access-date = 23 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some cities chose to repeal their own bans on sleeping in vehicles.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; In Los Angeles in 2015, approximately 9,500 homeless have turned their cars into homes.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; In [[Hawaii]], a [[Honolulu]]-based company is retrofitting five retired city [[bus]]es into mobile shelters which provide a place to sleep and get a shower.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/12/hawaii-mobile-homeless-shelters_n_7571924.html|title = Hawaii to Convert Retired Buses Into Fleet of Mobil Homeless Shelters, Showers|last = Goldberg|first = Eleanor|date = 12 June 2015|work = The Huffington Post|access-date = 24 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Community attitudes ==
Community attitude towards homeless shelters varies widely, but one study found that older people, men, homeowners and all people making larger incomes were often adverse to the concept of homeless shelters in general.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Putting Health Into Place|last = Takahashi|first = Lois M.|publisher = Syracuse University Press|year = 1998|isbn = 0815627688|location = Syracuse, New York|pages = 153–157|chapter = Concepts of Difference in Community Health|editor-last = Kearns|editor-first = Robin A.|editor-last2 = Gesler|editor-first2 = Wilbert M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Calgary]] neighborhoods recognize the need for shelters, but many don't want to situate a shelter near their own homes.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A similar response came from residents in [[Oahu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/story/29524570/state-homeless-shelters-controversial-now-and-20-years-ago|title = State Homeless Shelters Controversial Now and 20 Years Ago|last = Kerr|first = Keoki|date = 10 July 2015|work = Hawaii News Now|access-date = 22 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In communities such as Portland, Oregon, where the weather can be quite harsh, there is an extensive network of supporters. These operate an informal restaurant, the "Sisters of the Road" cafe, which supports both homeless shelter residents and also some unsheltered persons. At the opposite end of the spectrum, jurisdictions such as [[Santa Barbara, California]], feature ongoing disputes in an often highly adversarial mode.&lt;ref&gt;Santa Barbara Independent, January 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Disputes have even reached such schemes as re-arranging benches on city sidewalks to discourage panhandlers. In another 2011 incident, an eight unit [[supportive housing]] project which had been approved was called back onto city council agenda the following week in order to allow approximately 35 public comments pro and con, despite the fact that the measure had just been approved.

There have at times been concerns raised about the transmission of diseases in the homeless population housed in shelters, although public health professionals contend that such concerns are inflated.&lt;ref&gt;Najidah Association Inc. Annual return to the Dept. of Communities 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.osha.gov/pls/oshaweb/owadisp.show_document?p_id=13923&amp;p_table=FEDERAL_REGISTER |title=Occupational Exposure to Tuberculosis |publisher= [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]] notice |year=1997 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, a study published in 2014 conducted in [[Marseille|Marseille, France]] found that respiratory illnesses in homeless shelters were not significantly different from the general population.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1756-0500/7/81|title = Respiratory viruses within homeless shelters in Marseille, France|last = Thiberville|first = Simon-djamel|date = 5 February 2014|journal = BMC Research Notes|doi = 10.1186/1756-0500-7-81|pmid = |access-date = 23 July 2015|volume = 7|issue = 81|last2 = Salez|first2 = Nicolas|last3 = Benkouiten|last4 = Badiaga|first3 = Samir|first4 = Sekene|last5 = Charrel|first5 = Remi|last6 = Brouqui|first6 = Philippe}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, during the peak [[influenza]] months, the shelter occupants did not test positive for the flu virus and the researchers hypothesize that being isolated from others may have been the reason they were virus-free.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; However, outbreaks of [[tuberculosis]] in have been reported occurring in shelters within three large [[Ohio]] cities in the 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Epidemic of Health Care Worker Injury: An Epidemiology|last = |first = |publisher = CRC Press|year = 1999|isbn = 0849333822|location = |pages = 78|editor-first = William|editor-last = Charney|editor-last2 = Fragala|editor-first2 = Guy|chapter = Occupational Exposure to Tuberculosis}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A question has been raised as just how much money donated to the charities that run the shelters actually gets to the homeless people and the required services. In many cases, there is a large overhead in administrative costs, which compromise the money for their homeless clients.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.bostonnow.com/news/local/2007/08/13/the-high-price-of-giving|title = The High Price of Giving|last = O'Brien|first = James|date = 13 August 2007|work = Boston Now|access-date = 23 July 2015|archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20071111183241/http://www.bostonnow.com/news/local/2007/08/13/the-high-price-of-giving|archive-date = 11 November 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Internal problems in homeless shelters ===
There is sometimes corruption and theft by the employees of a shelter as evidenced by a 2011 investigative report by [[WFXT|FOX 25 TV]] in [[Boston]] wherein a number of Boston public shelter employees were found stealing large amounts of food over a period of time from the shelter's kitchen for their private use and catering.&lt;ref&gt;Beaudet, Mike, [http://www.myfoxboston.com/dpp/news/undercover/money-food-taken-from-city-kitchen-20110222 "FOX Undercover: Employees implicated in thefts from local homeless"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303140612/http://www.myfoxboston.com/dpp/news/undercover/money-food-taken-from-city-kitchen-20110222 |date=2011-03-03 }}, FOX 25 TV, Boston, Tuesday, 22 Feb 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Smith, Stephen, [http://www.boston.com/news/local/massachusetts/articles/2011/02/23/shelter_kitchen_theft_prevalent_report_says/ "Shelter kitchen theft prevalent, report says"], ''The Boston Globe'', February 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Residents have reported that personal items, such as underwear, were stolen by other residents while they were occupied.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Shelter: Where Harvard Meets the Homeless|last = Seider|first = Scott|publisher = The Continuum International Publishing Group|year = 2010|isbn = 9781441137371|location = New York|pages = 33–34}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelters can become dangerously overcrowded when too many occupants are allowed entry to the shelter.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/06/nyregion/sylvias-place-faces-licensing-problems.html?_r=0|title = A Church.

Shelters sometimes are unable to meet state standards for occupancy, such as testing fire sprinklers or ensuring that exits are clearly marked.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; In New York city, 2015, the state withheld funding from many shelters which did not meet standards or which had poor conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/state-withholds-funds-from-some-new-york-city-homeless-shelters-1431482602|title = State Withholds Funds From Some New York City Homeless Shelters|last = Dawsey|first = Josh|date = 12 May 2015|work = The Wall Street Journal|access-date = 24 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shelter employees are sometimes at risk from violence perpetrated by the residents they are serving.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015%EF%BF%BC/04/30/nyregion/bronx-homeless-shelter-killing.html?gwh=80DDD7BE14E14C13FF1291CDC7859CCF&amp;gwt=pay|title = Police Describe Ex-Resident's Calculated Plan to Attack Bronx Homeless Shelter's Director|last = Hu|first = Winnie|date = 29 April 2015|work = The New York Times|access-date = 23 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In order to address problems faced by employees who are trying to help the homeless in New York, the [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Department of Homeland Security]] increased [[Security guard|security]] at some shelters and conducted security assessments of shelters in 2015.&lt;ref name=":17"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.nytimes.com/2015/07/07/nyregion/new-york-city-works-to-improve-safety-of-homeless-shelter-workers.html|title = New York City Takes Steps to Increase the Safety of Employees at Homeless Shelters|last = Hu|first = Winnie|date = 6 July 2015|work = The New York Times|access-date = 23 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; While many employees of shelters know that there is a risk when working in high-crime neighborhoods or with individuals who are mentally ill, they continue to work at homeless shelters because they feel that they are performing a public service akin to the [[police]] or [[firefighter]]s.&lt;ref name=":17" /&gt;

=== External problems ===
Several problems emerge when a homeless shelter is present. Homeless shelters have been argued by some to have a negative effect on nearby businesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=f5h&amp;AN=95939242&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Investing in the Homeless Corridor|last = Nishimura|first = Scott|date = 28 April 2014|journal = Fort Worth Business Press|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 22 July 2015|subscription = yes|volume = 26|issue = 16|pages = 1, 23–25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Businesses for years have complained that they frequently witness pedestrians being stopped outside their stores by homeless people begging for money. Such instances have led to the creation of local laws that prohibit “aggressive panhandling.” Another problem is that it is often difficult to decide on where a homeless shelter should be built and how to zone the area where a shelter can be built.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.kimatv.com/home/video/City-of-Yakima-struggles-to-find-a-solution-for-homeless-shelter-zoning-318085811.html|title = City of Yakima Struggles to Find a Solution for Homeless Shelter Zoning|last = Ramos|first = Claudia|date = 21 July 2015|work = KIMA TV|access-date = 22 July 2015|via = |deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20150723095630/http://www.kimatv.com/home/video/City-of-Yakima-struggles-to-find-a-solution-for-homeless-shelter-zoning-318085811.html|archivedate = 23 July 2015|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Neighborhoods, as well as schools, argue that homeless shelters bring in bad elements to their surroundings. There are additionally far too many shelters that have become nothing but housing facilities; they fail to provide job training or education that would assist the homeless population with gaining their own housing. Housing through homeless shelters offers no lasting solutions, just temporary ones. Drugs and alcohol also tend to surround homeless shelters. Most shelters prohibit residential use of illegal drugs and alcohol, but enforcement is sporadic in many locations. Lastly, no classification system for shelters has been put into effect. There are no mechanisms or facilities to separate those who have mental illnesses from the rest of the shelter population.&lt;ref&gt;Skolnick, Jerome H., and Elliott Currie.

In the [[United States]], the "shelter movement" began to grow significantly during the 1970s when there was a high rate of [[unemployment]], housing costs were rising and individuals with severe [[Mental disorder|mental illnesses]] were being deinstitutionalized.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In the 1980s, homelessness was becoming a "national epidemic" in the United States and helping professionals created shelters as "temporary havens."&lt;ref name=":15"&gt;{{Cite book|title = Homelessness|last = Culhane|first = Dennis|publisher = Greenhaven Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780737759396|location = Farmington Hills, Michigan|chapter = Better Information About Homelessness Means Better Strategies|pages = 177}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shelter occupation had more than doubled by the late 1980s and it doubled again by 2000.&lt;ref name=":15" /&gt; Statistics from 2011 show that "on a given night in January 2010, 407,966 individuals were housed inside homeless shelters, transitional housing or on the streets.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://homeless.samhsa.gov/ResourceFiles/hrc_factsheet.pdf|title = Current Statistics on the Prevalence and Characteristics of People Experiencing Homelessness in the United States|date = July 2011|accessdate = 17 December 2015|website = Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration|publisher = |last = Paquette|first = Kristen}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, [[Jail|jails]] have been used for healthcare enrollment by citizens in certain states.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/publication/86666/using_jail_to_enroll_low_income_men_in_medicaid.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Simultaneously, organizations such as [[Interfaith Services]] have provided low income postal service boxes to aid in receiving missing ID cards obtained by pro-Bono legal service organizations such as the Colorado ID project.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.interfaithofnc.com/about&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://coloradolegalservices.org&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeless shelters need to provide a variety of services to diverse residents. Homeless shelters, like La Posada Providencia in [[San Benito, Texas]], may also house [[Refugee|asylum seekers]], mainly from [[Mexico]], [[Central America]] and [[South America]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://search.ebscohost.com/login.aspx?direct=true&amp;db=a9h&amp;AN=100169989&amp;site=ehost-live|title = Seeking Refuge|last = Rose|first = Ananda|date = 9 January 2015|journal = Commonweal|doi = |pmid = |access-date = 22 July 2015|volume = 142|issue = 1|pages = 10–12|subscription = yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shelters also provide [[outreach]] to residents who are unable to use a shelter or who choose not to use a shelter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://wishtv.com/2015/01/07/team-effort-to-help-indys-homeless-survive-the-cold/|title = Team Effort to Help Indy's Homeless Survive the Cold|last = Grove|first = Dustin|date = 7 January 2015|work = Wish TV|access-date = 22 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Outreach may include providing clothing for cold weather or food. Very few shelters have case managers that locate resources locally, such as rides to a department of social services where [[Medicaid|healthcare]] can be acquired. 

Most shelters typically expect residents to exit in the morning and occupy themselves elsewhere during the day, returning for an evening meal and to sleep. During times of inclement weather, shelters may provide services outside of their normal hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nbcneb.com/home/headlines/Homeless-Battle-Heat-Through-Help-From-Homeless-Shelters-315123761.html|title = Homeless Battle Heat Through Help From Homeless Shelters|last = Champ|first = Anastasia|date = 15 July 2015|work = NBC Nebraska|access-date = 22 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Curfew]]s vary widely but tend to be at an earlier hour than adults typically might return to a home. There are also daytime-only homeless shelters, where the homeless can go when they cannot stay inside at their night time sleeping shelter during the day. Such an early model of a daytime homeless shelter providing multi-faceted services is [[Saint Francis House (Boston)|Saint Francis House]] in [[Boston, Massachusetts]] which was officially founded in 1984. It was based on the [[Settlement movement|settlement house]], [[Clubhouse Model of Psychosocial Rehabilitation|clubhouse]]  and [[Community centre|community center]] support and social service models.

In the United States, the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) has shown in recent studies that about 5 million Americans qualify to use homeless shelters. As poverty levels continue to rise, it is estimated that the number of homeless shelters, in particular in the United States, will continue to rise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.homelessshelterssite.org/|title = Homeless Shelters|date = |accessdate = 22 July 2015|website = Homeless Shelters|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on a survey of 24 U.S. cities the average stay in a homeless shelter was found to be on average about seven months out of the year.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Homelessness|last = National Coalition for the Homeless|first = |publisher = Greenhaven Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780737759396|location = Farmington Hills, Michigan|pages = 71|chapter = Multiple Factors Contribute to Homelessness}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Statistics of homeless population within the United States ===
{{Main|Homelessness in the United States}}

A study by the [[The National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty|National Law Center on Homelessness and Poverty]] estimates that 2.3 to 3.5 million Americans experience homelessness annually. [[Alaska]], [[California]], [[Nevada]], [[Oregon]], [[Colorado]], and [[Hawaii]] are the states with the highest concentration of homeless people.  Around 1.5 million children or one of out every 50 children in America are homeless. Many Americans suffer from the state of “chronic homelessness,” which is where an individual has a disabling condition who has been continuously homeless for over a year or has been homeless on at least four different instances within four years. About 23% of the homeless population has been tagged as “chronic homeless.” Veterans also represent close to 40% of homeless men within the United States. [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|Racial demographics]] of the Homeless Population of the United States can be represented as:

* Whites: 39%
* African-Americans: 42%
* Hispanics: 13%
* Native Americans: 4%
* Asians: 2%
Approximately 40% of all homeless youth in the United States identify as [[LGBT]] (Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Transgender).&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://nationalhomeless.org/issues/lgbt/|title = LGBT Homelessness|date = |accessdate = 22 July 2015|website = National Coalition for the Homeless|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[San Francisco]], approximately 29% of all the homeless in that city are on the LGBT spectrum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.ebar.com/news/article.php?sec=news&amp;article=70764|title = The Bay Area Reporter|last = Hemmelgarn|first = Seth|date = 23 July 2015|work = The Bay Area Reporter|access-date = 23 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[National Center for Transgender Equality]] reports that 1 in 5 [[transgender]] individuals has experienced being homeless at least once in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://transequality.org/issues/housing-homelessness|title = Housing &amp; Homelesslessness|date = |accessdate = 22 July 2015|website = National Center for Transgender Equality|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pet ownership among the homeless varies, but estimates indicate that about 5 and 10 percent of the homeless in the United States have a pet.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.nevadabusiness.com/2015/07/pets-homeless-embarks-sixth-annual-give-dog-bone-week/|title = Pets of the Homeless Embarks on Sixth Annual Give a Dog a Bone Week|last = Walquist|first = Scott|date = 15 July 2015|work = Nevada Business|access-date = 23 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homelessness appears to be largely concentrated within urban areas. Central cities hold 71% of the homeless population while the suburbs have 21% of the homeless population. Only 9% of the homeless class can be located within rural areas.

===Operations and role in U.S. society===

Homeless shelters are usually operated by a [[non-profit agency]] or a municipal agency, or are associated with a church. They almost always have Section 501(c)3 corporate organization with a [[Board of directors|Board of Directors]] pulled from various sectors of the community. Often, such Boards include clergy, elected officials, and even shelter residents and people from the surrounding community.

Shelters which are funded by the [[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development]] (HUD) require residents to have identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = http://www.tucsonweekly.com/tucson/dignity/Content?oid=5546437|title = Dignity|last = Taracena|first = Maria Ines|date = 16 July 2015|work = Tucson Weekly|access-date = 23 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Homeless shelters often provide other services to the community at large. The classic example is the [[soup kitchen]] for persons who are not staying at the shelter. Others include [[support group]]s, and/or [[substance abuse]] treatment. If they do not offer any of these services, they can usually refer their clients to agencies that do. [[Supportive housing]] integrates services in a more assertive fashion. The typical pathway through the interlocking system is that a person may start in a shelter and move through [[transitional housing]] into [[supportive housing]] and finally independent housing.

Centers in the United States are also often coordinated with outside programs both for their mission-specific operations and for ancillary services. For communication of their availability, most coordinate with the Federally mandated 2-1-1 or the 3-1-1 phone information system which allow needy persons to find out where shelters are located.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} For transportation to shelters, some offer free transportation,[15] particularly in cases of persons being released from jail. Some jails have specific staff assigned to placement of persons being released. {{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}

=== List of national organizations in the U.S supporting homeless shelters ===
Across the United States there are several national organizations that assist in the founding and the upkeep of homeless shelters. The main national organizations are: 
* The National Alliance to End Homelessness
* [[The Salvation Army]]
* The National Coalition for the Homeless
* The Emergency Food and Shelter Program (United Way)
* The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]]
* [[Feeding America]] 
* [[Housing Assistance Council]]
* Help USA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.homeless.org.au/directory/shelters.htm|title = Homeless Shelters and Programs|date = |accessdate = 22 July 2015|website = Homeless.org|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States libraries===
Homeless shelters often work with other organizations in order to support and help the homeless improve their situations, including libraries.&lt;ref&gt;American Library Association. (2014). ''Outreach Resources for Services to Poor and Homeless People''. Retrieved From http://www.ala.org/advocacy/diversity/outreachtounderservedpopulations/servicespoor&lt;/ref&gt; They often work with the coalition to grant a temporary library card for homeless coalition members who can use a shelter as a local address.  This is intending to give new patrons the opportunity to utilize the computer services, books, programs, and more that the library offers.&lt;ref&gt;Community Legal Aid. (2011). ''Library changes borrowing policy for homeless.'' Retrieved From: {{cite web |url=http://www.communitylegal.org/work/news/article091406 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-03-30 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20140331213210/http://www.communitylegal.org/work/news/article091406 |archivedate=2014-03-31 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Government assistance programs in the United States ===
Homeless individuals within the United States are assisted through various Federal programs. Examples include the Social Security Disability Insurance (SSD) and the Social Security Supplemental Income (SSI) programs. Such applicants may qualify through their medical records. The Social Security Disability Insurance service extends benefits to families if they have earned sufficient work “credits.” The Social Security Supplemental Income service offers financial assistance towards individuals in need who are disabled, blind or elderly.

[[United States Department of Housing and Urban Development|HUD]] estimates that it costs $60,000 each year to house a homeless family in a shelter.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite news|url = https://www.npr.org/2015/07/07/420537082/for-homeless-families-quick-exit-from-shelters-is-only-a-temporary-fix|title = For Homeless Families, Quick Exit From Shelter is Only a Temporary Fix|last = Fessler|first = Pam|date = 7 July 2015|work = National Public Radio (NPR)|access-date = 22 July 2015|via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, HUD has various programs in place to help families, including rapid rehousing and permanent housing [[voucher]]s.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Housing vouchers from HUD are considered especially important for helping to prevent families with children from becoming homeless and also to help these families be able to leave the shelter system permanently.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Homelessness|last = Sard|first = Barbara|publisher = Greenhaven Press|year = 2012|isbn = 9780737759396|location = Farmington Hills, Michigan|chapter = Government Housing Vouchers Help Homeless Families Best|pages = 131}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[United States Department of Veterans Affairs|Department of Veterans Affairs]] is solely aimed at helping [[homeless veterans in the United States|homeless veterans]]. Although this organization assists a specific concentration of individuals, it currently constitutes the largest network of homeless treatment within the United States.{{Citation needed|date = July 2015}}

== Other countries ==

=== Australia ===
In [[Australia]], due to government funding requirements, most homelessness services fill the role of both daytime and night time shelters. Shelters develop empowerment based "wrap around" services in which residents are case managed and supported in their efforts to become self-reliant. An example of such a service provider in this area in Australia is [[Najidah (Australia)|Najidah]].

Youth refuges in Australia provide both a residential setting for crisis accommodation as well as case management to assist young people to live independently. Youth refuges are a relatively new form of homeless shelters. In New South Wales the early refuges include [[Caretakers Cottage]], Young People's Refuge, Taldamunde Youth Services, all founded in the mid-1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, Michael.

'''Iyaelima people''' are an ethnic group with a population of about 2,500 that live in eight settlements in the southern part of the [[Salonga National Park]] (SNP) in the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]].{{sfn|Furuichi|Thompson|2008|p=190}}
They belong to the [[Mongo people|Mongo]] group of [[Bantu peoples]].{{sfn|Hopson|2011|p=79}}
Although they practice [[slash-and-burn]] agriculture and hunt for bushmeat, they have little impact on the environment.
The Iyaelima never kill [[bonobos]], an ape closely related to humans whose population is much higher in Iyaelima territory than elsewhere.{{sfn|Falk|2008|p=1}}

==Location==

[[File:La rivière Lulilaka, parc national de Salonga, 2005.jpg|thumb|250px|Lulilaka River in the Salonga National Park]]
The Salonga National Park was established as the Tshuapa National Park in 1956, and gained its present boundaries with a 1970 presidential decree by President [[Mobutu Sese Seko]].{{sfn|Hopson|2011|p=81}}
It was registered as a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]] in 1984.{{sfn|Hopson|2011|p=82}}
Most of the Salonga National Park is accessible only via river.{{sfn|Furuichi|Thompson|2008|p=190}}
The region in the southwest of the park occupied by the Iyaelima is accessible via the [[Lokoro River]], which flows through the center. The [[Lokolo River]] defines the northern boundary and [[Lula River]] the south.{{sfn|Furuichi|Thompson|2008|p=229}}

When the SNP was established, most of the inhabitants were expelled but the Iyaelima managed to remain.{{sfn|Furuichi|Thompson|2008|p=230}}
The Iyaelima had gained a reputation as ferocious warriors, which they were careful to cultivate. They were allowed to stay under a law that categorizes them as "wildlife".{{sfn|Falk|2008|p=1}}

The park structure is based on the American National Park model in which wilderness areas are cleared of their indigenous inhabitants. The [[World Wildlife Fund]] (WWF) has been pressing to do the same with the Iyaelima, the last remaining residents of the SNP.{{sfn|Hopson|2011|p=63}}
The Iyaelima are hostile to the park, to [[Institut Congolais pour la Conservation de la Nature]] (ICCN) personnel who manage it and to the park guards. They have not been informed of park laws, for example prohibiting trade in wild animals, and mainly interact with ICCN personnel over legal problems. Only one of the Iyaelima is employed by the park.{{sfn|Furuichi|Thompson|2008|p=239}}

==Society==

The Iyaelima are patriarchal, with the men hunting and women farming and doing most of the housework.
Few of them ever leave their territory, other than a very small number of coffee traders.
A family will live in a one-room mud hut.
A typical farm is a half-acre in size, cleared by slash-and-burn, on which they grow cassava, sugarcane and rice.
Mangabeys, colobus, hogs and forest elephant graze in the secondary forest surrounding the Iyaelima settlements.
All of these are hunted for food.{{sfn|Falk|2008|p=5}}
The Iyaelima mostly use spears or bows and arrows, and are assisted by trained hunting dogs.
The preferred prey includes various types of duiker and hogs.
However, bonobos are never killed.{{sfn|Hopson|2011|p=86}}

The ''etoschi'', a council of wise men, make the decisions in a village.
Sorcerers provide protection through witchcraft. Although they cannot destroy an evil spirit they can prevent it from doing harm.
The villagers engage in sacred hunts, slaughtering the animals they catch in a sacred ritual on a public altar.
They bury their dead beside or underneath the family hut. Until recently they practiced cannibalism to feed their ancestors.{{sfn|Falk|2008|p=5}}

==Conservationists==
[[File:Juvenile bonobo.png|thumb|250px|Juvenile bonobo]]
Contrary to the views of the WWF and other NGOs, a survey by Jo Thompson of the independent Lukuru Wildlife Research Project concluded that the Iyaelima were helping conserve the environment.{{sfn|Falk|2008|p=1}}
The Iyaelima recognise that some sites are magical, inhabited by water or forest spirits or by their ancestral spirits.
They do not occupy these locations or hunt in them, and in return the spirits provide protection.
They thus create natural animal sanctuaries.
[[Lake Nkantotsha]] is a spirit lake of this type.{{sfn|Furuichi|Thompson|2008|p=230}}
Hunters are careful to leave areas of forest undisturbed to allow animal populations to regenerate.
Based on aerial photography, the impact of the Iyaelima on the forest is minimal.{{sfn|Greatest hope...}}

The Salonga National Park is home to an unusually large group of [[bonobo]]s, a species of ape that shares 98% of their DNA with humans and are thus our closest non-human relatives. The Iyaelima have a harmonious relationship with the bonobos, whose population is much higher in Iyaelima territory than elsewhere in the park.{{sfn|Falk|2008|p=1}}
The Iyaelima recognize that bonobos are similar in many ways to humans, and see them as equally intelligent, but have no feeling of kinship with them and are insulted by the suggestion that they are relatives.
However, they avoid bonobos when they meet them in the forest, thinking the bonobos may beat them up or kill them, just as other ethnic groups might. For this reason, they do not kill bonobos for fear of stirring up conflict with them.{{sfn|Furuichi|Thompson|2008|p=239}}

The ICCN is understaffed in Salonga, with just 137 guards for the entire area, many near retirement age, where at least 1,000 would be needed to enforce conservation laws effectively. The Iyaelima, with their profound local knowledge and track record of conservation may be an effective alternative to guards.{{sfn|Hopson|2011|p=99}}

At least 36 people were convicted and most of them spent years imprisoned. Thirty-four convictions were overturned on appeal.  The district attorney responsible for the convictions was [[Ed Jagels]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://truthinjustice.org/ed-jagels.htm |title=Mean Justice - Dirty Secrets |website=Truthinjustice.org |date= |accessdate=2016-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; who was sued by at least one of those whose conviction was overturned,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aele.org/law/2003LRAUG/mvc.html|title=Modahl v.

==History==
In 1982, Alvin and Debbie McCuan's two daughters, coached by their step-grandmother Mary Ann Barbour, who had custody of them, alleged they had been abused by their parents, and accused them of being part of a sex ring that included Scott and Brenda Kniffen. The Kniffens' two sons also claimed to have been abused. No physical evidence was ever found. The McCuans and Kniffens were convicted in 1984 and given a combined sentence of over 1000 years in prison.&lt;ref name=rt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/ra_baker.htm |title=Kern County ritual abuse cases |accessdate=2007-08-26 |quote=The triggering incident occurred in 1980 when Becky McCuan disclosed that her grandfather, Rod Phelps, had touched her inappropriately. The family doctor confirmed the abuse.  |publisher=Religious Tolerance }}&lt;/ref&gt; The convictions were overturned in 1996 and the two couples were released. In 2001, a TV movie about the Kniffens titled ''Just Ask My Children'' was aired on [[Lifetime (TV network)|Lifetime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0280474/|title=Just Ask My Children|date=10 September 2001|publisher=|via=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Six similar cases occurred throughout Kern County. For instance, the testimony of five young boys was the prosecution's key evidence in a trial in which four defendants were convicted. John Stoll, a 41-year-old carpenter, received the longest sentence of the group: 40 years for 17 counts of lewd and lascivious conduct. "It never happened," Ed Sampley, one of the accusers, told a ''New York Times'' reporter in 2004. He claimed he had lied about Stoll. Stoll was in prison for 19 years before his conviction was reversed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2004/may/01/local/me-stoll1 Conviction reversed after 19 years], [[Los Angeles Times]], John Johnson, May 1, 2004. Retrieved 11 October 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Stoll sued Kern County and was awarded $5 million in compensation.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090930214951/http://www.wrongfulconvictionlawsuitdefense.com/2009/09/articles/news/john-stoll-to-receive-5m-settlement-in-20-year-wrongful-conviction-case-featured-in-the-documentary-witch-hunt/ Web.archive.org]&lt;/ref&gt; The county paid out nearly $10 million to settle claims made by the former prisoners and the alleged victims.&lt;ref name=edj&gt;{{cite news|title=Crusading Calif. D.A. retires, leaves painful wake|author=Garance Burke|publisher=Associated Press|date=2009-11-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; A documentary titled ''Witch Hunt'', which focused primarily on Stoll's case, was produced and released in 2007. MSNBC also made a documentary on John Stoll and the Kern County cases.

Sampley and three other former accusers returned in 2004 to the courthouse where they had testified against Stoll, this time to say that Stoll never molested them. In their late 20s, each of them said he always knew the truth—that Stoll had never touched them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/09/19/magazine/19KIDSL.html|title=Who Was Abused?|date=19 September 2004|work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Stoll's son has "continued to say that he had been molested."&lt;ref name=Logan&gt;{{cite news|last=Logan |first=Jessica |title=Prosecutor's fire makes her either loved or loathed |publisher=The Bakersfield Californian |date=2005-05-31 |url=http://www.bakersfield.com/862/story/100201.html |accessdate=2008-07-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080827235257/http://bakersfield.com/862/story/100201.html |archivedate=August 27, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the case, the only defendant with a previous conviction of molestation was Grant Self, who rented Stoll's pool house briefly.&lt;ref name=Branco&gt;{{cite news|last=Branco|first=Shellie|title=Ruling puts man back in hospital|publisher=The Bakersfield Californian|date=2007-04-18|url=http://www.bakersfield.com/619/story/122888.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304113056/http://www.bakersfield.com/619/story/122888.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2016-03-04|accessdate=2008-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Stoll had to wait until 2004 for the reversal of his convictions, but was released on the new testimony.

Prior to the start of the Kern County child abuse cases, several local social workers had attended a training seminar that foregrounded satanic ritual abuse as a major element in child sexual abuse, and had used the now-debunked memoir ''[[Michelle Remembers]]'' as training material.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20110522150523/http://members.shaw.ca/imaginarycrimes/michelleremembers.htm Archive.is]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Kumandins''' also known as the '''Kumandy''', '''Kumanda''', '''Qumandy''' and '''Qumanda''' are a people indigenous to [[Central Asia]]. They reside mainly in the [[Altai Republic]] of the [[Russian Federation]].

According to the 1926 census, 6,335 Kumandins lived within the territory of [[Russia]]. In the 2010 census, the number was only 2,892, but possibly the 1926 census included some related peoples. Some Kumandins, living on the banks of the [[Biya River]], from the [[Kuu]] River downstream, almost to the city of [[Biysk]], and along the lower course of the river [[Katun River]], by 1969 were conflated with the [[ethnic Russian]] population.&lt;ref name="Potapov L.P. p. 21"&gt;{{harvp|Potapov|1969|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Omeljan Pritsak]] claimed that ''kuman-'' in the name of the Kumandins is identical in meaning to the names given to the [[Turkic people]], ''[[Cumans]]''-Kipchaks and ''[[Kipchaks|Polovets]]'' (a Slavic term for [[Cumans]]).&lt;ref&gt;Pritsak O., ''"Stammesnamen und Titulaturen der altaischen Volker. Ural-Altaische JahrMcher"'', Bd. 24, 1952, Sect. 1–2, pp. 49–104&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Potapov_72"&gt;{{harvp|Potapov|1969|p=58}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the ''[[Seok (clan)|seoks]]'' (tribes) of the Kumandins have varying origin myths; L. Potapov proposed that they were originally a federation of peoples from different backgrounds: nomadic [[steppe]] pastoralists (such as the [[Cumans]]), [[taiga]] hunters ([[Chuvash people|Chuvash]]), deer pastoralists ([[Nenets people|Nenets]]), and fishers ([[Tatars]]).&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{harvp|Potapov|1969|pp=47, 62, 54, 60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[The] Kumans belonged to the Kuman-Kipchak confederation (Polevetses of the Rus annals, Comans of Byzantine sources, Folban of German annals) [and] during the period from the end of the 800s to 1230s CE spread their political influence in the broad steppes from [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] to [[Crimea]] and [[Danube]]. [[Irtysh]] with its adjoining steppes (at least below the lake [[Lake Zaysan|Zaisan]]) was in the sphere of that confederation. Members of the confederation undoubtedly also were the ancestors of the present Kumandy and Teleuts, which is evidenced by their language that like the language of the [[Siberian Tatars|Tobol-Irtysh]] and [[Baraba Tatars]] belongs to the [[Kipchak languages|Kypchak group]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Potapov|1969|p=59}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the 17th century, the Kumandins lived along the river [[Charysh River|Charysh]], near its confluence with the river [[Ob river|Ob]]. A subsequent relocation to the Altai was driven by their unwillingness to pay ''[[yasak]]'' (financial tribute) to the Russian sovereign.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Potapov|1969|pp=56–69}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikolai Aristov|N. Aristov]] linked the Kumandins – and the [[Chelkans]] – to the ancient Turks, "who in the 6th-8th CC. CE created in [[Central Asia]] a powerful nomadic state, which received ... the name [[Göktürks|Turkic Kaganate]]".&lt;ref&gt;Aristov N. A., ''Notes on ethnic composition of Türkic tribes and nations''//Olden Times Alive, 1896, v. 3–4, p. 341&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Potapov|1969|pp=14, 53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Potapov regarded the Kumandins as being related anthropologically to the [[Uralic peoples]], and suggested that they were less [[East Asia]]n than the Altaians proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Potapov|1969|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt; This subjective impression has been borne out to an extent by genetic research suggesting that most Kumandin males belong to [[Y-DNA]] haplogroups that are generally found in populations further to the west, such as [[haplogroup R1b|R1b]] (although the Kumandins belong to R1b-M73 rather than R1b-M269, the latter being the subclade to which a majority of Europeans belong) and [[Haplogroup N-M231|N-P43]] (Dulik ''et al.'' (2012) have remarked that, in fact, Chelkans and Kumandins have N-P43 Y chromosomes very similar to ones found in the Ugric-speaking Khanty).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 3276666 | pmid=22281367 | doi=10.1016/j.ajhg.2011.12.014 | volume=90 | title=Mitochondrial DNA and Y chromosome variation provides evidence for a recent common ancestry between Native Americans and Indigenous Altaians | year=2012 | journal=Am.

An ancient Turkic legend recorded in the Chinese Zhoushu annals (周書, 636 CE) tells of the origin of the ancestors of the ancient Türks from a state or possession named ''So'', located "north of the [[Huns|Hun]] country" (which, in this case, apparently meant Mongolia).&lt;ref name="Potapov_54"&gt;{{harvp|Potapov|1969|p=54}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;N. Aristov asserted: "The tribal possession So, lying to the north of the Hun country, i. e. from the present [[Mongolia]], should be on the northern side of Altai mountains, for its southern slopes were part of the Hun lands... From that, with sufficient reliability can be concluded that the legendary forefather of the Turks descended from the tribe So that lived in the northern Altai, and that the clan So is a small remainder of that, probably not such a small tribe during prehistoric times". " Aristov N.A., ''Notes on ethnic composition of Türkic tribes and nations''//Olden Times Alive, 1896, Vol. 3-4, p. 279&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Liu Mau-tsai, ''"Die chinesischen Nachrichten zur Geschichte der Ost-Türken"'', vol. 1, pp. 5–6, vol. 2, pp. 489–490, Wiesbaden, 1958&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Potapov|1969|p=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The name of the seok Ton is explained as an ethnonym that reflects their economic specialization, as a word meaning "deer" and "reindeer breeder".&lt;ref&gt;{{harvp|Potapov|1969|pp=60, 61}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remote ancestors of this Kumandy seok Ton were reindeer breeders, reflected in Kumandy hunting legends and fairy tales, for example about milking deer (which is attributed to the Kumandy's mountain spirits). The memory about breeding and milking reindeer belongs to some remote historical ancestors of a part of Kumandy; they can be explained by participation in the Kumandy ethnogenesis of the southern Nenets tribes, who cultivated riding deer, typically used not only for transport but also for food and dress.

Several languages are spoken in Sri Lanka within the [[Indo-European languages|Indo-European]], [[Dravidian languages|Dravidian]] and [[Austronesian Languages|Austronesian]] families. [[Sri Lanka]] accords official status to [[Sinhalese language|Sinhalese]] and [[Tamil language|Tamil]]. The languages spoken on the island nation are deeply influenced by the languages of neighbouring [[India]], the [[Maldives]] and [[Malaysia]]. [[Arab people|Arab]] settlers and the [[colonialism|colonial powers]] of [[Portugal]], the [[Netherlands]] and [[United Kingdom|Britain]] have also influenced the development of modern languages in Sri Lanka.

== Languages ==
As per 2016, the Sinhala language is mostly spoken by the [[Sinhalese people]], who constitute approximately 74.9% of the national population and total about 16.6 million. It uses the [[Sinhalese script|Sinhala abugida]] script, which is derived from the ancient [[Brahmi script]]. The [[Rodiya language]], a dialect of Sinhala, is spoken by the low-[[Indian caste system|caste]]  community of chamodi veddhas. The [[Veddah]] people, totaling barely 2,500 in 2002,&lt;ref&gt;{{e18|ved|Veddah}}&lt;/ref&gt; are thought to have once spoken a distinct language, possibly a creolised form of an earlier indigenous language. The Tamil language is spoken by [[Sri Lankan Tamils]], as well as by [[Indian Tamils of Sri Lanka|Tamil migrants]] from the neighboring [[India]]n state of Tamil Nadu and by most [[Sri Lankan Moors]]. Tamil speakers number around 4.7 million. There are more than 50,000 speakers of the [[Sri Lanka Malay|Sri Lankan Creole Malay]] language, which is strongly influenced by the Malay language.

It is the native language of approximately 74,000 people, mainly in urban areas.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3128">'''Leonard Emil Mins''' (? - ?) was an American who worked in the Russian Section of the Research and Analysis Division of the [[Office of Strategic Services]] (OSS) during [[World War II]].  Mins also worked for Soviet Military Intelligence ([[GRU]]).

Mins joined the [[Communist Party of the United States]] (CPUSA) in 1919 and worked for the Communist movement in Germany in 1920 and 1921. In 1924 and 1925 Mins worked for the Executive Committee of the [[Comintern]] as a translator. From 1927 to 1932 Mins did Communist Party work in the [[United States]]. In 1934 he transferred his party membership to the [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] (CPSU).

Mins was in [[France]] in 1938 working with exiled German writers, one of whom was the father of the later notorious East German spymaster and [[Stasi]] officer [[Markus Wolf]].  In his 1997 memoirs Wolf recalled his old friend as, "a Communist exile who had been my parents' close friend" in Russia. "He had been the channel through which my father was able to communicate with us during his internment in France."

Mins worked for the OSS from 1942 to late 1943, and worked mostly on a survey of strategic minerals and [[oil reserves]] in Asia and the Soviet Union. Mins was the subject of a [[Dies Committee]] investigation in 1943. Mins denied being a member of the [[Communist Party of the United States]] (CPUSA) but admitted he taught at the Workers School, a Communist controlled entity, and served on the editorial board of ''[[Partisan Review]]'', had been a member of the [[John Reed (journalist)|John Reed Club]], written for the ''[[New Masses]]'', and a member of the League of American Writers. Mins admitted he had lived in Moscow from 1934 to 1936 but insisted he only made translations for the [[Soviet Academy of Sciences]].

[[File:Obverse of Lister Medal.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Obverse of the Lister Medal, with a representation of a bust of Lord Lister]]

The '''Lister Medal''' is an award presented by the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] in recognition of contributions to [[surgery|surgical science]]. It is named after the English surgeon [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]] (1827-1912), whose work on antiseptics established the basis of modern sterile surgery.

The medal has its origins in the Lister Memorial Fund, started by the [[Royal Society]], which was raised by public subscription after Lister's death, with the object of creating a lasting mark of respect to his memory. In 1920, the Royal College of Surgeons of England became the trustees and administrators of the fund. They were entrusted with the task of awarding a monetary prize and a bronze medal (gold since 1984) every three years, irrespective of nationality, to those who had made outstanding contributions to surgical science. The triennial award is decided by a committee representing the Royal Society, the Royal College of Surgeons of England, the [[Royal College of Surgeons in Ireland]], the [[University of Edinburgh]], and the [[University of Glasgow]].

The Lister Medal, although it is not always awarded to a surgeon, is one of the most prestigious honours a surgeon can receive. The obverse of the medal consists of a representation of a bust of Lord Lister. The reverse side has the recipient's name across centre, and around the edge of the medal is text naming the award along with the dedication:

{{cquote|FOR DISTINGUISHED CONTRIBUTIONS TO SURGICAL SCIENCE}}

On the occasion of the award, the medallist delivers the '''Lister Oration''' (sometimes called the "Lister  Memorial Lecture"). The first award was announced in 1924, with the presentation and the lecture taking place the following year. The most recent award was made in 2015, with a total of 27 people having received the medal to date.

'''Macchanu''' ({{lang-km|មច្ឆានុ}} - ''Mach-chha-nu''), ({{lang-th|มัจฉานุ}}; {{RTGS|''Matchanu''}}) is son of [[Hanuman]] that appears in the [[Cambodia]]n, [[Thailand|Thai]] and other [[Versions of Ramayana|versions of the Ramayana]].&lt;ref name=z/&gt;&lt;ref name=x/&gt;&lt;ref name=y/&gt;&lt;ref name=a&gt;[http://www.learnnc.org/lp/multimedia/2588 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=b&gt;[http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/ramayana/1189]&lt;/ref&gt;

As per these versions of [[Ramayana]], during one of the battles with [[Ravana]]'s army, Hanuman encounters one powerful opponent, who looked like [[vanara]] from waist-up but had tail of a fish. After a fierce battle, as Hanuman was about to hit the creature with his weapons, a golden star shining in the sky above, reveals by way of [[Akashvani (term)|aakashwani]] that the enemy, whom he is going to harm is his own son born by his union with [[Suvannamaccha]], the [[mermaid]] daughter of Ravana. Hanuman, immediately holds his weapons in mid-air and father-son duo recognize each other.&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=b/&gt;

Another version of story tells, while following [[Ahiravana|Maiyarab]] in order to find [[Rama]] and [[Laxmana]], who have been abducted by Maiyarab and taken to his kingdom in netherworld, Hanuman reaches a pond, where he encounters Macchanu. The fight between them is indecisive, therefore, Hanuman is surprised and asks his opponent, who is he. Macchanu introduces, himself as son of Hanuman and  Suvannamaccha and so they finally identify and embrace each other. He tells Hanuman that Maiyarab is his foster father, who had picked him up lying on sea shore, where his mother had left him. Although, he does not want to betray Maiyarab but tells Hanuman through a riddle the entrance to the netherworld lies inside the lotus in the pond he was guarding.&lt;ref name=z&gt;{{cite book|title=The Ramayana and the Malay shadow-play by Amin Sweeney, Vālmīki|year=1972|publisher=Penerbit Universiti Kebangsaan Malaysia,|pages=238, 246, 440|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qGrYAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Macchanu&amp;dq=Macchanu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SdqXUK6mAoP5rQfI9IH4Aw&amp;ved=0CEEQ6AEwBw}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=x&gt;{{cite book|title=Satya sudhā, a critical evaluation of Dr. Satya Vrat Shastri's creative works by Satya Vrat Varma|year=1991|publisher=Eastern Book Linkers|pages=190, 205, 214|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9vxjAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Macchanu&amp;dq=Macchanu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SdqXUK6mAoP5rQfI9IH4Aw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAw}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=y&gt;{{cite book|title=Śrīrāmakīrtimahākāvyam: Thāirāmakathāmāśritya praṇītamabhinavaṃ Saṃskr̥tamahākāvyam by Satyavrat Sastri|year=1990|publisher=Mūlāmala Sacadeva Pratiṣṭhānam|pages=xvi,224, 282|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=A6QtAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=Macchanu&amp;dq=Macchanu&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=SdqXUK6mAoP5rQfI9IH4Aw&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAg}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Myles Yukata Fukunaga''' was a Japanese-American from Honolulu, Hawaii. In 1928, he kidnapped and murdered George Gill Jamieson, the 10-year-old son of a local banker.

Subsequent to the murder, he demanded a $10,000 ransom.  Before the body of the victim was found, the Hawaiian Trust Company offered a reward of $5,000 with no questions asked.&lt;ref name=honosearch&gt;{{cite news |title=All Honolulu on Search to Find Son of Banker|newspaper=Schenectady Gazette |date=Sep 20, 1928 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=dmMhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=jIYFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3582,2396636&amp;dq=gill-jamieson+ransom }}&lt;/ref&gt; Fukunaga eventually received $4,000 in $5 bills from the victim's father before he was arrested.&lt;ref name=slayboy&gt;{{cite news |title=Kidnappers Slay Boy|newspaper=The Pittsburgh Press|date=Sep 21, 1928 |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=Cu8aAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=OEoEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1677,3671800&amp;dq=ransom+gill-jamieson }}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''opening ceremony''', '''grand opening''', or '''ribbon-cutting ceremony''' marks the official opening of a newly-constructed location or the start of an event.&lt;ref name="Adams"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=shTNn75df5kC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=%22Grand+openings%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiz-ufN57jNAhVFKWMKHdrrAu0Q6AEIMDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Grand%20openings%22&amp;f=false ''Streetwise Meeting and Event Planning'']. Grand Openings: Chapter 8. [[Adams Media]]. pp. 89–103.&lt;/ref&gt; Opening ceremonies at large events such as the [[Olympic Games]], [[FIFA World Cup]], and the [[Rugby World Cup]] might involve thousands of participants and be watched worldwide.

In the case of physical establishments, its grand opening might be preceded by a "soft opening" or "[[soft launch]]" in which the establishment begins to operate with little promotion, to allow testing of operations, procedures, and facilities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1482">A '''professional conference''' is a meeting of professionals in a given subject or [[profession]], dealing with organizational matters, matters concerning the status of the profession, and scientific or technical developments. It differs from an [[academic conference]] in having broader goals, and usually a much broader attendance. they are normally sponsored by the [[professional society]] in the field, and usually are organized on a national basis.  

Some are international, usually organized by federations or groups of the national societies in a subject, such as the   conferences held by the [[International Federation of Library Associations]] (IFLA). 

Some are local, normally by state, province, or other local sections of a national body. 

They are often held annually, or on some other recurring basis. Some of the largest societies hold more than one a year.  

Others are held as a one time event, and are usually devoted to a specific topic.

There are several national systems for rating the quality of [[public library|public libraries]].

==United States==
The  basic  public library statistics (not rankings) are published by the [[National Center for Educational Statistics]]; the most recent version was published in July 2006, using data from fiscal year 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/libraries/site_index.asp Library Statistics program site Index]&lt;/ref&gt;  As of October 1, 2007, the Institute of Museums and Library Services assumed responsibility for the publication of public library statistics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://harvester.census.gov/imls/pubs/pls/index.asp IMLS Library Statistics - Public Library Publications&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

A commercial product, ''Hennen’s American Public Library Ratings Information'' [http://haplr-index.com (HAPLR)], is prepared by Thomas J. Hennen Jr. [http://www.haplr-index.com/ResumeLong.htm],  Director of [[Waukesha County Federated Library System]] in Wisconsin. It is published annually in the November edition of [[American Libraries]], and rates over 9,000 [[public library|public libraries]] in the United States based on this data.&lt;ref&gt;Library Statistics Program [http://nces.ed.gov/surveys/libraries/FSCS.asp].&lt;/ref&gt;   Libraries are ranked on 15 input and output measures with comparisons in broad population categories.

An alternative system [https://web.archive.org/web/20090221072437/http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA6629180.html (the LJ Index of Public Library Service)] developed by Keith Curry Lance and Ray Lyons, was introduced in the June 15th 2008 issue of [[Library Journal]]. Libraries are rated on four equally weighted per-capita statistics with comparison groups based on total operating expenditures. The four statistics, library visits, circulation, program attendance, and public internet computer uses, were chosen based on correlation analysis. The system awards 5-star, 4-star, and 3-star designations rather than library ranks, due to recognized imprecision of the library statistical data.  The LJ Index measures how the levels of services a library provides compares with other libraries.  Creators of the LJ Index stress the fact that it does not measure service quality, operational excellence, library effectiveness, nor the degree to which a library meets existing community information needs.

===Controversy===
The HAPLR ratings have drawn significant criticism and praise from members of the library community.

In [[Library Journal]], Oregon State Librarian Jim Scheppke notes that the statistics that HAPLR relies on are misleading because they rely too much on output measures, such as circulation, funding, etc. and not on input measures, such as open hours and patron satisfaction. He adds "To give HAPLR some credit, collectively, the libraries in the top half of the list are definitely better than the libraries in the bottom half, but when it gets down to individual cases, which is what HAPLR claims to be able to do, it doesn't work." &lt;ref&gt;Scheppke, Jim. (1999-11-15) “The Trouble with Hennen”, ''Library Journal'' 124 (19): p. 36, {{ISSN|0363-0277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, John Berry III, in a Library Journal  editorial said  "Unfortunately, when you or your library receives any kind of honor, it stimulates the flow of competitive hormones in your professional colleagues. This jealousy rears its ugly head in many ways. We've suffered endless tutorials on the defects in Hennen's rankings. So what? They work!" &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA158847.html?q=hennen+1999  April 15, 1999] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607121337/http://www.libraryjournal.com/article/CA158847.html?q=hennen+1999 |date=June 7, 2011 }}  Library Journal&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2008 article in [[Public Libraries]] Ray Lyons and Neal Kaske argue for greater recognition of the strengths and limitations of ratings.&lt;ref&gt;"Honorable Mention: What Public Library National Ratings Say" (Nov/Dec 2008)''Public Libraries'' p.36-41.&lt;/ref&gt; They point out that, among other factors, imprecision in library statistics make ratings scores quite approximate, a fact rarely acknowledged by libraries receiving high ratings. The authors also note that HAPLR calculations perform invalid mathematical operations using ordinal rankings, making comparisons of scores between libraries and between years meaningless.

A 2006 Library School Student Writing Award article questions HAPLR’s weighting of factors, and its failure to account for  local factors (such as a library’s mission) in measuring a library’s success, the index’s failure to measure computer and Internet usage, and its lack of focus of on newer methods of evaluation, such as customer satisfaction or return on investment.&lt;ref&gt;Nelson, Elizabeth. (Winter 2007) “Library Statistics and the HAPLR Index” by Elizabeth Nelson  ''Library Administration &amp; Management''  21 (1) : p. 9, {{ISSN|0888-4463}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Keith Curry Lance and Marti Cox, both of the ''Library Research Service'', take issue with HAPLR’s reasoning backwards from statistics to conclusion, point out the redundancy of HAPLR’s statistical categories, and question its arbitrary system of weighting criteria.&lt;ref&gt;Lance, Keith Curry and Marti A. Cox. (June/July 2000), “Lies, Damn Lies, and Indexes”, ''American Libraries''  31 (6): p. 82, {{ISSN|0002-9769}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hennen responded to Lance and Cox in the same issue of [[American Libraries]],saying their "thesis seems to be that the job of comparing libraries cannot be done, so I am at fault for having tried. Somehow, unique among American public or private institutions, libraries are just too varied and too local to be compared. Yet despite these assertions, the authors urge individuals to use the NCES Public Library Peer Comparison tool (nces.ed.gov/surveys/libraries/publicpeer/) to do this impossible task."   &lt;ref&gt;American Libraries; Jun/Jul2000, Vol. 31 Issue 6, p87, 1p&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia and New Zealand==
There is some interest in developing an index in Australia and New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;Alan Bundy in ''APLIS, the Australasian Public Library and Information Science'' {{cite web |url=http://conferences.alia.org.au/alia2000/proceedings/alan.bundy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-09-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070907041145/http://conferences.alia.org.au/alia2000/proceedings/alan.bundy.html |archivedate=2007-09-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Great Britain==
Great Britain adopted national standards, and in 2000 the Audit Commission began publishing both a summary annual reports of library conditions and individualized ratings of libraries.  Audit Commission personnel base the reports on statistical data, long-range plans, local government commitment to the library, and a site visit.  The Audit Commission is an independent body.  Every library is assigned a score.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bestvalueinspections.gov.uk/ Audit Commission - homepage&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051123124210/http://www.bestvalueinspections.gov.uk/ |date=2005-11-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==

Bertelsmann Publishing partners with the German library association to produce BIX, a library index quite similar to HAPLR.  The main difference between BIX and HAPLR, is that BIX was designed to provide comparisons of one library to another in a given year as well as over time. HAPLR compares all libraries to one another only during a given year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bertelsmann-stiftung.de/documents/Projekt_Info_Englisch_010112.pdf English version]{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Real Marriage: The Truth About Sex, Friendship, and Life Together''''' is a 2012 marriage book written by [[Christian]] author [[Mark Driscoll (pastor)|Mark Driscoll]] and his wife, Grace, and published by [[Thomas Nelson (publisher)|Thomas Nelson]]. The book spent one week on the [[New York Times Best Seller list|''New York Times'' Best Seller list]] for advice books,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/best-sellers-books/2012-01-22/hardcover-advice/list.html NYT Bestseller list] NY Times&lt;/ref&gt; however, controversy arose when it was later reported that a former pastor of [[Mars Hill Church]] had contracted with the marketing firm [[Result Source]] to affect metrics on the best-seller list shortly before resigning. The church also created a Real Marriage sermon series based on the book.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://markdriscoll.org/sermons/real-marriage|title=Real Marriage series}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Content==
In the preface, Mark and Grace Driscoll state that they developed the book after they had counseled many couples—many of them facing challenges on how to apply the Bible to their marriage. According to the authors, many of the couples they counseled were afraid of asking questions, and the book sought to address those questions.&lt;ref name=p5-25&gt;Driscoll, ''Real Marriage'', p 5-25.&lt;/ref&gt; The book holds to the [[complementarianism|complementarian]] view of marriage between one man and one woman. 
The book is divided into three parts: Marriage, Sex, and The Last Day.  In part one, the Driscolls share their personal stories, including their individual upbringings, their years as a dating couple, and conflict in their marriage. In part two, the authors deal with three different views of sex—sex as god, sex as gross, and sex as gift. In part three, the authors lay out how to "reverse engineer" one's marriage, by examining how to "finish well" on its last day.

==Real Marriage Series==
The book was later turned into a sermon series, featuring Mark Driscoll and his wife Grace, with question and answers at the end of each sermon. Paralleling the book's content, the series is divided into:

*[http://markdriscoll.org/sermons/real-marriage/friend-with-benefits "Friend with Benefits"] Driscoll cites the story of [[Martin Luther]] and [[Katharina von Bora]]  to discuss friendship in the context of marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://markdriscoll.org/sermons/real-marriage/friends-with-benefits|title=Real Marriage series}}{{dead link|date=April 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[http://markdriscoll.org/sermons/real-marriage/men-and-marriage "Men and Marriage"] Driscoll cites the [[book of Genesis]], stating that when Eve sinned, God called on Adam, not Eve. Driscoll states that men are responsible for their wife and family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://markdriscoll.org/sermons/real-marriage/men-and-marriage|title=Real Marriage series}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[http://markdriscoll.org/sermons/real-marriage/the-respectful-wife "The Respectful Wife"] Driscoll states that this chapter was written by his wife Grace, and that he is "just delivering the mail." Driscoll refers to the book of [[Ephesians]] stating that a "respectful wife" consists of praying for her husband, "respecting him thereby making him respectable," but not enabling him with silent compliance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://markdriscoll.org/sermons/real-marriage/the-respectful-wife|title=Real Marriage series}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
Critical reception for the book has been mixed, with [[Publishers Weekly]] praising the book's "boldly refreshing approach".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-1-4002-0383-3 Nonfiction Review: Real Marriage] Publishers Weekly&lt;/ref&gt; [[Relevant (magazine)|Relevant]] wrote that "Though it's certainly not all bad, the helpful and the harmful in Real Marriage are too thoroughly intertwined to be helpful."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.relevantmagazine.com/culture/books/reviews/27795-review-real-marriage REVIEW: Real Marriage] Relevant Magazine&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticism===
The book has faced criticism due to the Driscolls' detailed and frank discussion of sex in ''Real Marriage''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://religion.blogs.cnn.com/2012/01/06/pastors-detailed-book-on-sex-divides-reviewers-sparks-controversy/ Pastor’s detailed book on sex divides reviewers, sparks controversy] CNN&lt;/ref&gt; The Driscolls have stated that they did not write the book for people looking to read the book for "voyeuristic" intents, but because they viewed sex as an important part of marriage and that the majority of marriage help books were written for people who had not "experienced sexual assault or been abused or exposed to pornography or sexual sins".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/by-topic/book-news/religion/article/49954-mark-and-grace-driscoll-telling-the-truth-about-marriage.html Mark and Grace Driscoll: Telling the Truth about Marriage] Publishers Weekly&lt;/ref&gt; The book has also been criticized for content such as chapters entitled "The Respectful Wife", with critics stating that the book was "an astoundingly unbelievable work of disrespect for women"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/01/13/mark-driscoll-s-sex-manual-real-marriage-scandalizes-evangelicals.html Mark Driscoll’s Sex Manual ‘Real Marriage’ Scandalizes Evangelicals] The Daily Beast&lt;/ref&gt; and that "the book focuses so much on sex that it can create the impression that it's the most important element of marriage".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianpost.com/news/mark-driscoll-talks-real-marriage-with-cnns-piers-morgan-71255/ Mark Driscoll Talks 'Real Marriage' With CNN's Piers Morgan] Christian Post&lt;/ref&gt;

Mark Driscoll has replied to these criticisms, stating that he was aware that the book's content would "catch flak" and that "accommodating everyone would be impossible".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.christianpost.com/news/mark-driscoll-responds-to-criticism-of-church-and-sex-in-real-talk-67827/ Mark Driscoll Responds to Criticism of Sex Talk in 'Real Marriage'] Christian Post&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York Times Bestseller controversy==
In March 2014, ''The Los Angeles Times'' reported that Mars Hill Church contracted with [[Result Source]] "to conduct a bestseller campaign for your book, 'Real Marriage' on the week of January 2, 2012. The bestseller campaign is intended to place 'Real Marriage' on the New York Times bestseller list for the Advice How-to list." To achieve this, the contract stated that "RSI will be purchasing at least 11,000 total orders in one-week." This took place and as a result, the book was successfully ranked #1 on the hardcover advice bestseller list on January 22, 2012.&lt;ref name=kellogg2014&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.latimes.com/books/jacketcopy/la-et-jc-pastor-contract-resultsource-bestseller-lists-20140305,0,7039368.story#axzz2vCwCm0fo |title=Can bestseller lists be bought?  |work=[[LA Times]] |author=Carolyn Kellogg |date=March 6, 2014 |accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.mhpbooks.com/got-200000-congratulations-youre-a-bestselling-author/ |title=Got $200,000? Congratulations, you’re a bestselling author. |publisher=[[Melville House Publishing]] |author=Julia Fleischaker |date=March 7, 2014 |accessdate=March 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 28, 2015, a former elder of the church revealed that [[Mark Driscoll]] had not been involved in initiating nor signing the contract with the marketing firm Result Source. The elder stated that the business relationship with Result Source was initiated by a pastor who resigned shortly thereafter, and remaining church leaders disagreed over the completion of the contract stating that it would reflect badly on the church and Mark Driscoll.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/article/former.mars.hill.elder.gives.inside.story.of.controversy.plan.to.boost.mark.driscolls.book.sales/52667.htm |title=Former Mars Hill elder gives inside story of controversial plan to boost Mark Driscoll's book sales}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3223">The '''Rer Bare''' (or '''Rerebere''', '''Adona''') are a tribe in [[Ethiopia]]'s eastern [[Ogaden]] region on the [[Shabele River]], near [[Somalia]], who currently speak [[Somali language|Somali]]. They appear to have shifted to Somali from a now-extinct language.&lt;ref&gt;{{E18|rer|Rer Bare language}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Language and origins ==
Their unattested but apparently non-Somali language&lt;ref&gt;{{glottolog|rerb1235|Rer Bare}}&lt;/ref&gt; seems to have been first mentioned in print by [[Lionel Bender (linguist)|Lionel Bender]] in 1975:

: D. W. Mcclure, Sr. first reported to me the presence of [[Sudan]]ese [[immigrant]]s on the Wabi Shebelle River at [[Gode]] in the eastern Ogaden.  They are said to have their own language, bearing the given name [Rerebere]. Later Taye Reya informed me that Sudanese immigrants are found along the [[Ganale  River|Ganale]] and [[Dawa River]]s as well, and that they are referred to by the [[Somali people|Somali]] as ''rer bare'' (''rer'' means sub-[[tribe]] in Somali.) They are also known as ''adona'', and they speak Somali as well as their own language... I cannot say with certainty whether they speak one or more languages of what any of them is... So far no linguistic data has come my way.

Others have linked the Rer Bare to the [[Bantu languages|Bantu language family]], implying that they may be the remnants of a Bantu-speaking pre-Somali population or, like the "[[Somali Bantu]]" in the [[Jubba River]] valley of southern [[Somalia]], the descendants of Bantu slaves imported from other parts of East Africa in the 19th century. Tobias Hagmann refers to them as "Somalised Bantu".&lt;ref name=HAGM&gt;Hagmann, Tobias (2005): [http://www.tobiashagmann.net/documents/Hagmann_2005_ROAPE.pdf Challenges of decentralisation in Ethiopia's Somali Region], Briefing for Review of African Political Economy Vol. 32, No. 103, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Ulrich Braukämper]]:

: The Adonē, a dark-skinned Somali-speaking population on the banks of the Wabi Shäbälle, are obviously the offspring of Bantu slaves who settled and expanded there since the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Braukämper, Ulrich (2003): ''Islamic History and Culture in Southern Ethiopia. Collected Essays'', ''Göttinger Studien zur Ethnologie'' 9, {{ISBN|978-3-8258-5671-7}} (p. 15, 137)&lt;/ref&gt;

A British hunter, Colonel Swayne, who visited [[Imi, Ethiopia|Imi]] in February 1893, relates that he was the guest of Gabba Oboho, a chief of the Adona, for several days.&lt;ref&gt;H. G. C. Swayne, [https://www.jstor.org/stable/1773666 "A Trip to Harar and Imé", ''Geographical Journal''], 2 (September 1893), p. 251&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rusyns''', also known as '''Ruthenes''' ([[Rusyn language|Rusyn]]: Русины ''Rusynŷ''; also sometimes referred to as Руснакы ''Rusnakŷ'' &amp;ndash; '''Rusnaks'''), are a primarily [[Diaspora|diasporic]] [[ethnic group]] who speak an [[East Slavic languages|East Slavic language]] known as ''[[Rusyn language|Rusyn]]''. Rusyns descend from [[Ruthenians|Ruthenian peoples]], who did not adopt the use of the [[ethnonym]] "[[Ukrainians|Ukrainian]]" in the early 20th century. As residents of the [[Carpathian Mountains]] region, Rusyns are also sometimes associated with the Slovak highlander community of [[Gorals]] (literally, "Highlanders").

The [[endonym]] ''Rusyn'' has frequently not been recognised by various governments and in other cases has been prohibited.&lt;ref name="Magosci"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Paul Magocsi|authorlink=Paul Robert Magocsi|url=http://www.litopys.org.ua/rizne/magocie.htm|year=1995|title=The Rusyn Question|journal=Political Thought|volume=2-3|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The main population of Rusyns are '''Carpatho-Rusyns''', '''Carpatho-Ruthenians''', '''Carpatho-Russians''' of [[Carpathian Ruthenia]]: a discrete cross-border region of western [[Ukraine]], north-east [[Slovakia]], and south-east [[Poland]]. In official Ukrainian contexts, the various subgroups of Carpatho-Rusyns are often known collectively as '''''Verkhovyntsi''''' (Верховинці) literally meaning "Highlanders".

Today, [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]], [[Hungary]], the [[Czech Republic]], [[Serbia]] and [[Croatia]] officially recognize contemporary Rusyns (or Ruthenes) as an ethnic minority.&lt;ref name="RT_news"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20081212212346/http://www.russiatoday.com/features/news/34495 Ukraine’s ethnic minority seeks independence. ''RT'']&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Carpatho-Rusyns were recognized as a separate ethnicity in Ukraine by the Zakarpattia Regional Council, and in 2012 the Rusyn language gained official regional status in certain areas of the province as well as nationwide based on the 2012 Law of Ukraine "[[Language policy in Ukraine|about principles of state policy in Ukraine]]". Most contemporary self-identified ethnic Rusyns live outside of Ukraine.

Of the estimated 1.2 million people of Rusyn origins,&lt;ref name="Magosci"/&gt; as few as 90,000 individuals have been officially identified as such, in recent national censuses (see infobox above). This is due, in part, to the refusal of some governments to count Rusyns and/or allow them to self-identify on census forms, especially in Ukraine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zakarpattya.net.ua/News/10991-Zakonodavstvo-Ukrainy-ne-dozvoliaie-vyznaty-rusyniv-Zakarpattia-okremoiu-natsionalnistiu--|title=Законодавство України не дозволяє визнати русинів Закарпаття окремою національністю|publisher=|accessdate=18 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ethnic classification of Rusyns as a separate [[East Slavic peoples|East Slavic]] ethnicity distinct from [[Russians]], [[Ukrainians]], or [[Belarusians]] is, however, politically controversial.&lt;ref&gt;Professor Ivan Pop: ''Encyclopedia of Subcarpathian Ruthenia''(Encyclopedija Podkarpatskoj Rusi).

The terms "Rusyn," "Ruthenes," "Rusniak," "Lemak," "Lyshak" and "Lemko" are considered by some scholars to be historic, local and [[synonym]]ical names for Carpathian Ukrainians; others hold that the terms "Lemko" and "Rusnak" are simply regional variations of "Rusyn" or "Ruthene".&lt;ref name="Magosci"/&gt;

==Location==
{{refimprove section|date=December 2013}}
{{main|Places inhabited by Rusyns}}
Those who use the ethnonym Rusyn for self-identification are primarily people living in the mountainous Transcarpathian region of western Ukraine and adjacent areas in Slovakia who use it to distinguish themselves from Ukrainians living in the central regions of Ukraine. 

Those Rusyns who self-identify today have traditionally come from or had ancestors who came from the [[Eastern Carpathian|Eastern]] [[Carpathian Mountain]] region. This region is often referred to as [[Carpathian Ruthenia]].  There are resettled Rusyn communities located in the [[Pannonian Plain]], parts of present-day [[Serbia]] (particularly in [[Vojvodina]] – see also ''[[Ethnic groups of Vojvodina]]''), as well as present-day [[Croatia]] (in the region of [[Slavonia]]). Rusyns also migrated and settled in [[Prnjavor, Bosnia and Herzegovina|Prnjavor]], a town in the northern region of present-day [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]].

Many Rusyns [[emigrate]]d to the United States and [[Canada]]. With the advent of modern communications such as the [[Internet]], they are able to reconnect as a community.  Concerns are being voiced regarding the preservation of their unique ethnic and cultural legacy.

==Origins==
The region of Carpathian Ruthenia (Zakarpattia) and [[Prykarpattia]] since the Early Middle Age was inhabited by the tribes of [[White Croats]] and partly [[Dulebes]].&lt;ref name="Magocsi1995"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Carpatho-Rusyns|first=Paul Robert|last=Magocsi|author-link=Paul Robert Magocsi|journal=Carpatho-Rusyn American|volume=XVIII|number=4|year=1995|url=http://carpatho-rusyn.org/cra/chap3.html|publisher=Carpatho-Rusyn Research Center|quote=The purpose of this somewhat extended discussion of early history is to emphasize the complex origins of the Carpatho-Rusyns.

The ancestors are the early Slavs whose movement to the Danubian Basin was influenced by [[Huns]] and [[Pannonian Avars]] between the 5th and 6th century, the White Croats who lived in both slopes of the Carpathians and built many hill-forts in the region including [[Uzhhorod]] ruled by mythical ruler [[Laborec (ruler)|Laborec]], the Rusyns of Galicia and Podolia, and [[Vlachs|Vlachian]] shepherds of Transylvania.&lt;ref name="Magocsi1995"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=MmneTsicGY348QOm7dzNBA&amp;ct=result&amp;hl=sr&amp;id=rnMOAQAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Prince+Laborec&amp;q=Laborec#search_anchor|title=Our people: Carpatho-Rusyns and their descendants in North America|first=Paul R.|last=Magocsi|author-link=Paul Robert Magocsi|date=30 July 2005|publisher=Bolchazy-Carducci Publishers|page=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Population genetics ===
The 2006 mitochondrial DNA study of Carpathian Highlanders - [[Lemkos]], [[Hutsuls]] and [[Boykos]] people - showed a common ancestry with other modern Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Willis |first=Catherine |author= |authorlink= |year=2006 |title=Study of the Human Mitochondrial DNA Polymorphism |journal= McNair Scholars Journal |volume=10 |series= |issue=1 |page= |pages= |publisher= |pmid= |pmc= |doi= |bibcode= |url=http://scholarworks.gvsu.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1071&amp;context=mcnair |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; An 2009 analysis of maternal lineages found that Hutsuls have the highest frequency of the haplogroup [[Haplogroup H1 (mtDNA)|H1]] found in Central and Eastern populations to that date. Lemkos shared the highest frequency of haplogroup [[Haplogroup I (mtDNA)|I]] (11.3%), identical to 2005 sampled population of the island of [[Krk]] in Croatia indicating a founder effect, and the highest frequency of haplogroup [[Haplogroup M (mtDNA)|Haplogroup M*]] in the region. However, the haplogroup frequencies in Boykos were very different as had atypically low frequencies of haplogroup H (20%) and J (5%) for a European population. Comparison of eight other Central and Eastern European populations (Belorussian, Croatian, Czech, Hungarian, Polish, Romanian, Russian, Ukrainian), showed that the three groups had a greater distance between themselves than these populations, with Boykos showing the greatest distance from all and did not cluster with anyone, Lemkos being closest to the Czech and Romanian (0.17) population, while Hutsuls closest to the Croatian (0.11) and Ukrainian (0.16) population.&lt;ref name="pmid19589018"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Nikitin|first=Alexey G.|last2=Kochkin|first2=Igor T.|last3=June|first3=Cynthia M.|last4=Willis|first4=Catherine M.|last5=Mcbain|first5=Ian|last6=Videiko|first6=Mykhailo Y.|title=Mitochondrial DNA sequence variation in Boyko, Hutsul and Lemko populations of Carpathian highlands|journal=Human Biology|publisher=Human Biology (The International Journal of Population Biology and Genetics)|volume=81|issue=1|year=2009|pages=43–58|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.3378/027.081.0104|doi=10.3378/027.081.0104|accessdate=4 March 2016|pmid=19589018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2014 Y-DNA studies of 200 [[Pannonian Rusyns]] in the region of [[Vojvodina]], [[Serbia]], found they mostly belong to haplogroup [[Haplogroup R1a|R1a]] (43%), [[Haplogroup I-M438|I2]] (20%), [[Haplogroup E-V68#V-13|E-V13]] (12.5%), and [[Haplogroup R1b|R1b]] (8.5%), while [[Haplogroup I-M253|I1]], [[Haplogroup G-M201|G2a]], [[Haplogroup J-M172|J2b]], [[Haplogroup N-M231|N1]] between 2.5-4.5 percent, and [[Haplogroup J-M267|J1]], R1, [[Haplogroup T-M184|T]], and [[Haplogroup H (Y-DNA)|H]] only in traces of less than 1%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Veselinovic et al.|title=Genetic polymorphism of 17 Y chromosomal STRs in the Rusyn population sample from Vojvodina Province, Serbia.|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007%2Fs00414-013-0877-9|journal=International Journal of Legal Medicine|publisher=Springer Berlin Heidelberg|volume=128|issue=2|year=2014|pages=273–274|doi=10.1007/s00414-013-0877-9|pmid=23729201|accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They clustered closest to the Ukrainian and Slovakian population, "providing evidence for their genetic isolation from the Serbian majority population".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Rębała et al.|title=Northern Slavs from Serbia do not show a founder effect at autosomal and Y-chromosomal STRs and retain their paternal genetic heritage.|url=https://www.fsigenetics.com/article/S1872-4973(13)00185-3/abstract|journal=[[Forensic Science International: Genetics]]|publisher=[[Elsevier]]|volume=8|issue=1|year=2014|pages=126–131|doi=10.1016/j.fsigen.2013.08.011|pmid=24315599|accessdate=10 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rusyns formed two ephemeral states after [[World War I]]: the [[Lemko-Rusyn Republic]] and [[Komancza Republic]].  Prior to this time, some of the founders of the Lemko-Rusyn Republic were sentenced to death or imprisoned in [[Talerhof]] by the prosecuting attorney [[Kost Levytsky]] (Ukrainian: Кость Леви́цький), future president of the [[West Ukrainian National Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Terezin i Talergof : k 50-letnej godovščine tragedii galic.-rus. naroda |last=Vavrik |first=Vasilij Romanowicz |authorlink= |year=2001 |publisher=Soft-izdat |location=Moscow |language=Russian |isbn= |page= |pages= |oclc=163170799 |url=http://www.edrus.org/content/view/288/62 |accessdate=2009-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[interwar period]], the Rusyn diaspora in Czechoslovakia enjoyed liberal conditions to develop their culture (in comparison with Ukrainians in Poland or Romania).&lt;ref&gt;Orest Subtelny, ''Ukraine. A History''. Second edition, 1994. p. 350-351. Subtelny treats transcarpathian Rusyns as a group of Ukrainians&lt;/ref&gt; The Republic of [[Carpatho-Ukraine]], which existed for one day on March 15, 1939, before it was occupied by [[Kingdom of Hungary (1920–1946)|Hungarian]] troops, is sometimes considered to have been a self-determining Rusyn state that had intentions to unite with [[Kiev]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} The Republic's president, [[Avgustyn Voloshyn]], was an advocate of writing in [[Rusyn language|Rusyn]].{{Citation needed|date=November 2009}} Ukrainian insurgents from Galicia did attempt to bolster the defences of Carpatho-Ukraine but were unable to resist the Hungarian invaders, supported as the latter attacks were by Nazi Germany.

The Rusyns have always been subject to larger neighbouring powers, such as [[Hungary]], [[Czechoslovakia]], [[Slovakia]], [[Poland]], the [[Soviet Union]], [[Ukraine]], and [[Russia]]. In contrast to the modern [[History of Ukraine#First World War, the revolutions and aftermath|Ukrainian national movement]] that united Western Ukrainians with those in the rest of Ukraine, the Rusyn national movement took two forms: one considered Rusyns a separate [[Early East Slavs|East Slavic]] nation, while the other was based on the concept of fraternal unity with [[Russians]].

Most of the predecessors of the Eastern Slavic inhabitants of present-day Western Ukraine, as well as of Western Belarus, referred to themselves as Ruthenians (Rusyns) ({{lang-uk|Русини}}, [[Romanization of Ukrainian|transliteration]] ''Rusyny'') prior to the 19th century.  Many of them became active participants in the creation of the Ukrainian nation and came to call themselves [[Ukrainians]] ([[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]]: Українці, [[Romanization of Ukrainian|transliteration]] ''Ukrayintsi''). There were, however, ethnic Rusyn enclaves, which were not a part of this movement: those living on the border of the same territory or in more isolated regions, such as the people from Carpathian Ruthenia, [[Poleshuks]], or the Rusyns of [[Podlaskie]]. In the Soviet era, Boykos, Lemkos, Hutsuls, Rusyns, Ruski, Cossacks, Pinchuks, Polishchuks, and Lytvyns were classified as Ukrainian sub-groups.

Historically, the [[Poland|Polish]] and [[Hungary|Hungarian]] states are considered to have contributed to the development of a Rusyn identity that is separate from that of traditional Ruthenians. Rusyns were recorded as a separate nationality by the censuses taken in pre-World War II Czechoslovakia and Hungary, In  Poland, until 1939,  'Rusin' has been the official description of the whole nation, while "Ukrainians" were commonly the people involved in a nationalist movement. Nowadays all Polish citizens are allowed to define themselves by a single or double nationality,&lt;ref&gt;[http://stat.gov.pl/cps/rde/xbcr/gus/LUD_ludnosc_stan_str_dem_spo_NSP2011.pdf  Ludność.

According to the [[Ukrainian Census (2001)|2001 Ukrainian census]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ukrcensus.gov.ua | title=Ukrainian National Census 2001 | publisher=ukrcensus.gov.ua | accessdate=18 March 2015 | language=uk | script-title=uk:Всеукраїнського перепису населення 2001 | trans-title=Ukrainian National Census 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Vn|date=October 2015}} an overwhelming majority of Boykos, Lemkos, Hutsuls, Verkhovyntsi and Dolynians in Ukraine stated their nationality as Ukrainian. However, some of these ethnic groups consider themselves to be separate ethnicities, while others identify themselves as Rusyns. About 10,100 people, or 0.8%, of Ukraine's [[Zakarpattia Oblast]] (Province) identified themselves as Rusyns; by contrast, 1,010,000 considered themselves Ukrainians.&lt;ref name="ukraine"/&gt; Research conducted by the University of Cambridge during the height of political Rusynism in the mid-1990s that focused on five specific regions within the Zakarpattia Oblast having the strongest pro-Rusyn cultural and political activism, found that only nine percent of the population of these areas claimed Rusyn ethnicity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.taraskuzio.net/Nation%20and%20State%20Building_files/national-rusyns.pdf Taras Kuzio (2005).

[[File:Vojvodina west east slavs.png|thumb|upright=1.2|[[Pannonia]]n Rusyns in [[Vojvodina]], [[Serbia]] (2002 census).]]
The Rusyn national movement is much stronger among those Rusyn groups that became geographically separated from present-day Ukrainian territories, for example, the Rusyn emigrants in the United States and Canada, as well as the Rusyns living within the borders of Slovakia. The 2001 census in Slovakia showed that 24,000 people considered themselves ethnically Rusyn while 11,000 considered themselves to be ethnically Ukrainian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centroconsult.sk/Genealogy/census.html|title=Slovakia census 2001 - Genealogy|author=Peter Nagy|work=centroconsult.sk|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Pannonian Rusyns]] in Serbia, who migrated there during the rule of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]], also consider themselves to be Rusyns. In the 19th and early 20th centuries, some Rusyns resettled in [[Vojvodina]] (in present-day Serbia), as well as in [[Slavonia]] (in present-day Croatia). Still, other Rusyns migrated to the northern regions of the present [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]]. Until the 1971 [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] census, both Ukrainians ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]: Украјинци, [[Romanization|tr.]] ''Ukrajinci'') and Rusyns ([[Serbian Cyrillic alphabet|Serbian Cyrillic]]: Русини, [[Romanization|tr.]] ''Rusini'') in these areas were recorded collectively as "Ruthenes". ''Podkarpatskije Rusiny'' is considered the Rusyn "national anthem".{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}}

Since 1992, the Zakarpattia regional council has twice appealed for recognition of Rusyns as a distinct nationality to the Ukrainian parliament ([[Verkhovna Rada]]). According to the 2001 All-Ukrainian Census, approximately 10,000 self-identified Rusyns reside within [[Zakarpattia Oblast]] alone.  In August 2006, the UN Committee on liquidation on racial discrimination urged the [[Government of Ukraine]] to recognize Rusyns as a national minority.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  This is recognized in 22 countries around the globe.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  In March 2007, the [[Zakarpattia Oblast|Zakarpattia Regional Council]] adopted a decision which recognized Rusyns as a separate national minority at the oblast level.&lt;ref name="RT_news"/&gt; By the same decision the Zakarpattia Regional Council petitioned the Ukrainian central authorities to recognize Rusyns as an ethnic minority at the state level.

==Autonomist and separatist movements==
{{see also|Regionalism in Ukraine}}
A considerable controversy has arisen regarding the Rusyn separatist movement led by the Orthodox priest [[Dmitri Sidor]] (now Archbishop of Uzhorod, in the [[Ukrainian Orthodox Church (Moscow Patriarchate)]]), his relationship with the [[Russian Orthodox Church]] and funding for his activities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ua-reporter.com/novosti/42228|script-title=ru:Дмитрий Сидор отказался давать показания СБУ и "наехал" на журналистов|trans-title=Dmitry Sidorov refused to give evidence to a Ukrainian Security Services investigation and "struck back" at journalists|language=ru|work=ua-reporter.com|date=19 November 2008|accessdate=20 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ua-reporter.com/content/58928|script-title=uk:ПОЛІТИЧНЕ РУСИНСТВО І ЙОГО СПОНСОРИ|trans-title=Political Rusynism and its sponsors|language=uk|work=ua-reporter.com|date=11 July 2009|accessdate=19 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russia has, as a result of the Russian census of 2002, recognized the Rusyns as a separate ethnic group in 2004, and has been accused{{by whom?|date=January 2018}} of fueling ethnic tensions and separatism among Rusyns.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiosvoboda.org/content/article/24433107.html|script-title=uk:Україна в лещатах російських спецслужб|trans-title=Ukraine is in the grip of Russian secret services|language=uk|work=radiosvoboda.org|date=25 December 2011|accessdate=3 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A criminal case under Part 2, Art. 110 of the Ukrainian Criminal Code was initiated after the 1st European Congress of Rusyns took place in [[Mukachevo]] on June 7, 2008. At that particular congress, it was recognized the reinstating of the Zakarpattia's special status as special "territory of Rusyns to the south of the Carpathians" with self-government under the constitutional name Subcarpathian Rus. On October 29, in Mukachevo at a 2nd Congress, a memorandum was signed calling for the authorities to recognise the Subcarpathian Rus autonomy (by December 1). That same day, according to the ''[[Kommersant]]-Ukraine'' (Ukrainian edition) agents of the [[Security Service of Ukraine]] (SBU) questioned Dmytro Sidor and Yevgeniy Zhupan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ua.glavred.info/archive/2008/10/30/092718-16.html|script-title=uk:Лідерів русинів допитали в СБУ|trans-title=Leaders of Rusyns were questioned at the SBU|language=uk|work=ua.glavred.info|date=30 October 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110708111911/http://ua.glavred.info/archive/2008/10/30/092718-16.html|archivedate=8 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were summoned to SBU as witnesses in a criminal case "on the infringement on territorial integrity of Ukraine" initiated in June 2008. However the investigators were interested in the circumstances and sources of financing the 2nd European Congress of Rusyns that took place on October 25, at which the memorandum on reinstating Rusyn statehood was signed. According to Dmytro Sidor the Rusyn movement is financed through business. At the same time, Rusyn leaders claim that it does not infringe on the territorial integrity of the country. Sydor was reportedly convicted on charges relating to separatism in 2012.{{citation needed|date=September 2016}}

==Religion==
In 1994, the historian [[Paul Robert Magocsi]] stated that there were approximately 690,000 Carpatho-Rusyn church members in the United States, with 320,000 belonging to the largest [[Byzantine Catholic]] affiliations, 270,000 to the largest [[Eastern Orthodox]] affiliations, and 100,000 to various Protestant and other denominations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Magocsi |first1=Paul R |authorlink1=Paul Robert Magocsi |title=Our People: Carpatho-Rusyns and Their Descendants in North America |url= |edition= |date= |year=1994 |publisher=Multicultural History Society of Ontario |location=Toronto |isbn=9780919045668 |oclc=30973382 |doi= |page= |pages= |ref= |bibcode=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Byzantine Catholics===
{{unsourced section|date=January 2018}}
Most Rusyns are [[Eastern Catholic Churches|Eastern Catholics]] of the [[Byzantine Rite]], who since the [[Union of Brest]] in 1596 and the [[Union of Uzhhorod]] in 1646 have been in communion with the [[See of Rome]]. They have their own [[particular Church]], the [[Ruthenian Greek Catholic Church|Ruthenian Catholic Church]], distinct from the Latin Catholic Church. It has retained the Byzantine Rite liturgy, sometimes including the [[Old Church Slavonic]] language, and the liturgical forms of Byzantine or [[Eastern Orthodox Christianity]].

The [[Pannonian Rusyns]] of the [[Croatia]] are organized under the Byzantine Catholic [[Eparchy of Križevci]], and those in the region of [[Vojvodina]] (northern [[Serbia]]), are organized under the [[Byzantine Catholic Apostolic Exarchate of Serbia]]. Those in the [[diaspora]] in the [[United States]] established the [[Byzantine Catholic Metropolitan Church of Pittsburgh]].

===Eastern Orthodox===
{{unsourced section|date=January 2018}}
Although originally associated with the [[Eastern Orthodox Eparchy of Mukachevo]], that diocese was suppressed after the [[Union of Uzhhorod]]. New Eastern Orthodox [[Eparchy of Mukachevo and Prešov]] was created in 1931 under the auspices of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]]. That eparchy was divided in 1945, eastern part joining [[Russian Orthodox Church]] as the [[Eparchy of Mukachevo and Uzhhorod]], while western part was reorganized as [[Eastern Orthodox Eparchy of Prešov]] of the [[Czech and Slovak Orthodox Church]]. The affiliation of Eastern Orthodox Rusyns was adversely affected by the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Communist revolution]] in the Russian Empire and the subsequent [[Iron Curtain]] which split the Orthodox diaspora from the Eastern Orthodox believers living in the ancestral homelands. A number of émigré communities have claimed to continue the [[Orthodox Christianity|Orthodox Tradition]] of the pre-revolution church while either denying or minimizing the validity of the church organization operating under Communist authority. For example, the [[Orthodox Church in America]] (OCA) was granted autocephalous (self-governing) status by the Moscow Patriarchate in 1970. Although approximately 25% of the OCA was Rusyn (referred to as "Ruthenian") in the early 1980s, an influx of Eastern Orthodox émigrés from other nations and new converts wanting to connect with the [[Eastern Christianity|Eastern Church]] have lessened the impact of a particular Rusyn emphasis in favor of a new American Orthodoxy.

Many Rusyn Americans left Catholicism for Eastern Orthodoxy in 19th century due to disputes with the [[Latin Church]] bishops, who viewed different practices in the Byzantine Rite (such as married clergy) with suspicion.  After a bitter fight with Archbishop [[John Ireland (bishop)|John Ireland]], Father [[Alexis Toth]], himself a Rusyn from Hungary, converted to Eastern Orthodoxy and eventually led as many as 20,000 Rusyn-Americans from Catholicism into Eastern Orthodoxy, for which he was canonized by the Orthodox Church.

Another large segment of [[Rusyn Americans]] belong to the [[American Carpatho-Russian Orthodox Diocese]], which is headquartered in [[Johnstown, Pennsylvania]].  From its early days, this group was [http://www.acrod.org/diocese/history recognized by the Ecumenical Patriarchate] as a self-governing diocese.

==Ethnic subgroups==
Rusyns subgroups are [[Carpathian Rusyns]], mostly from [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] who speak [[Carpathian Rusyn language]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| author = [[Aleksandr Dulichenko|Дуличенко А.

'''Samuel Simon Krafsur''' (January 10, 1913 &amp;ndash; June 1983) was a [[Boston, Massachusetts|Boston]]-born [[journalist]] who worked for the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] news agency [[TASS (USSR)|TASS]] during [[World War II]]. He was also known as '''Bill Krafsur'''.

==Biography==
Krafsur was mentioned in the [[Venona]] intercepts under the codename IDE. He was used by the [[KGB]] during the war as a source of information and for recruiting journalists as informants and agents, and is referred to in the [[NSA]] archives as a "KGB agent"{{ref|NSA|1}} [http://www.nsa.gov/venona/venon00116.cfm?CFID=2412771&amp;CFTOKEN=59316524&amp;jsessionid=c830b21ad087a$5FoV$B#17].

In the 1930s Krafsur joined the [[Communist Party of America]]. He attended [[Northeastern University (Boston, Massachusetts)|Northeastern University]] for a year. He lived at 68 Phillips Street in Boston before going to [[Spain]] to fight with the [[Abraham Lincoln Brigade]] during the [[Spanish Civil War]], where he was wounded in 1937.

In 1938 Krafsur was a member of the editorial staff of "The Volunteers for Liberty" a newspaper which was an, "organ of the Veterans of the Abraham Lincoln Brigade" organization out of 125 West 45 Street in [[New York City]]. In April 1938 he was in charge of finding veterans to tell their war stories to be made into radio plays written by [[Irwin Shaw]].

He began working for TASS in 1941 after being recruited by the Soviet agent [[Vladimir Pravdin]]. He became the assistant to the manager [[Laurence Todd]] at the Washington sub-bureau.&lt;ref name="TASS, Theodore Eduard Kruglak page 99"&gt;The Two Faces of TASS, Theodore Eduard Kruglak, page 99.&lt;/ref&gt; Krafsur was considered an important asset to the KGB because of the many contacts he had with other newsmen. He was the deputy TASS bureau chief in [[Washington, D.C.]] and the [[FBI]] spent a lot of time and effort trying to identify who he was under his codename IDE.

In May 1944, he was described in a KGB cable from New York to Moscow as, "absolutely devoted to the [[USSR]]." He provided at least twenty leads of people for possible recruitment including [[Josef Berger (speechwriter)|Joseph Berger]], a personal aide to the chairman of the [[Democratic National Committee]], and [[I. F. Stone]].

In 1949, Laurence Todd was relieved of his managing duties and instead given the title of senior correspondent.&lt;ref name="TASS, Theodore Eduard Kruglak page 99"/&gt; In this same year Krafsur left TASS&lt;ref name="TASS, Theodore Eduard Kruglak page 99"/&gt; and was later called before the [[House Committee on Un-American Activities]] where he chose not to cooperate. Later he worked in a toy store.

In the early 1960s he married the ex-wife of the secretary-treasurer of the [[Mine, Mill, and Smelters Union]]. He died, at the age of seventy, in [[St. Petersburg, Florida]] in 1983 under the name "Samuel Krafsur".

[[File:Imilchil Weddings.jpg|thumb|A Soussi Berber woman at a traditional wedding.]]
The Soussis traditionally call themselves ''Isoussin''.

==History==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Zilveren hoofdversiering TMnr 6388-1.jpg|thumb|A traditional Shilha dowry item]]
In antiquity, Berbers traded with the [[Phoenicia]]ns and [[Punics|Carthaginians]] in commercial entrepots and colonies along the northwestern littoral. They established the ancient kingdom of [[Mauretania]], which fell under [[Roman Empire|Roman]] rule in 33 CE, before eventually being reunited under Berber sovereignty.&lt;ref name="Minahan2016p378"&gt;{{cite book|author=James B. Minahan|title=Encyclopedia of Stateless Nations: Ethnic and National Groups around the World, 2nd Edition|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=pGClDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA379#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2016|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-61069-954-9|pages=378–379}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 7th century, the Islamic [[Umayyad Caliphate]] invaded the Berber and [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] strongholds in the Northwest Africa, seizing [[Carthage]] in 698 AD. Although the Umayyads nominally controlled Morocco over the following years, their rule was tenuous due to Berber resistance, shortly in 739 AD Umayyad Arabs were killed by the Moroccan Berbers at the battle of Nobles and Bagdoura. Morocco remained under the rule of Berber kingdoms such as [[Barghawata]] and [[Banu Midrar|Midrar]] .. etc. In 789 AD, with the approval of the locals, a former Umayyad courtier established the [[Idrisid dynasty]] that ruled in Fez. It lasted until 970 AD, as various petty states vied for control over the ensuing centuries. After 1053, Morocco was ruled by a succession of Muslim dynasties founded by Berber tribes. Among these were the [[Almoravid dynasty]] (1053-1147) who spread Islam in Morocco, the [[Almohad dynasty]] (1147-1275), and the [[Marinid dynasty]] (1213-1524). In 1668, a sharifan family from the east assumed control and established the incumbent [[Alaouite dynasty|Alawite dynasty]].&lt;ref name="Alatas82"&gt;{{cite book|author=Syed Farid Alatas|title=Applying Ibn Khaldūn: The Recovery of a Lost Tradition in Sociology|url=https://www.google.com/books?id=0aLAAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA82#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|year=2005|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1317594002|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Soussis gradually adopted Islam, they and other Berbers in the mountains have held on to their traditional language, culture and [[traditional Berber religion|religious customs]] to varying degrees.&lt;ref name="Porch2005p7"&gt;{{cite book|author=Douglas Porch|title=The Conquest of Morocco|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=R2N3JzfsfHkC&amp;pg=PA7|year=2005|publisher=Macmillan|isbn=978-1-4299-9885-7|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=[[:fr:Robert Montagne|Robert Montagne]]|year= 1963|title= Les Berbères et le makhzen dans le sud du Maroc; essai sur la transformation politique des Berbères sédentaires (groupe chleuh)| publisher= Paris: F. Alcan|language=French|oclc= 1949564}}&lt;/ref&gt; A small minority of the Shilha people are Christians and Jewish.&lt;ref name="Minahan2016p378"/&gt;

The French and Spanish colonial empires partitioned Morocco in 1904, and the southern part of the territory was declared a French protectorate in 1912. Arabization remained an official state policy under both the colonial and succeeding post-independence governments. With the spread of the [[Berber Spring]] to Berber territory during the 1980s, the Berbers sought to reaffirm their Berber roots. This culminated with a proposal by Berber nationalists in 2013 to establish an independent Sousse state within a greater Morocco federation.&lt;ref name="Minahan2016p378"/&gt;

==Society==
[[File:A family from the Chleuh Shilha Shluh ethnic sub-group, Berber Morocco.jpg|thumb|A Shilha family]]
The Soussis mainly live in Morocco's Atlas Mountains and [[Sous]] Valley. Traditionally, they are farmers who also keep herds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James Stuart Olson|authorlink= James S. Olson|title=The Peoples of Africa: An Ethnohistorical Dictionary|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MdaAdBC-_S4C |year=1996|publisher=Greenwood |isbn=978-0-313-27918-8|page=523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some are semi-nomadic, growing crops during the season when water is available, and moving with their herds during the dry season.&lt;ref name=wwshilha/&gt;

The Soussi communities in the southwestern mountains of Morocco cooperated with each other in terms of providing reciprocal grazing rights as seasons changed, as well as during periods of war. These alliances were re-affirmed by annual festive gatherings, where one Soussi community would invite nearby and distant Shilha communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=George Peter Murdock|title=Culture and Society: Twenty-Four Essays|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MvrZVQ-rud8C&amp;pg=PA343|date=15 October 1965|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|isbn=978-0-8229-7406-2|pages=343–344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Language==
The Soussis speak the [[Shilha language|Tasoussit language]], a Tasoussit dialect. It belongs to the [[Berber languages|Berber]] branch of the [[Afroasiatic languages|Afro-Asiatic]] family.&lt;ref name="Shoup2011p54"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ethnologue.com/language/shi Tachelhit], Ethnologue (2007)&lt;/ref&gt; Their language is sometimes referred to as ''Sous-Berber''.&lt;ref name=Kossmann19&gt;{{cite book|author=Maarten Kossmann|title=The Arabic Influence on Northern Berber|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Se-BAAAAQBAJ |year=2013|publisher=BRILL Academic|isbn=978-90-04-25309-4|pages=19-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=MG Kossmann|author2=HJ Stroomer|editor=Alan S.

As of 2014, there were around 5 million Shilha speakers, constituting 14.1% of the Moroccan population.&lt;ref name="Comm"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Haut commissariat au Plan, Moroccan Kingdom|first1=Haut commissariat au Plan|title=Recensement général de la Maroc|url=http://rgphentableaux.hcp.ma/Default1/|website=HCP|publisher=Haut commissariat du Plan|accessdate=16 August 2016|language=Franch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soussi language differs considerably from certain Berber varieties, such as those spoken by the Tuareg.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph R. Applegate (1957), [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4322927 Berber Studies I: Shilha], Middle East Journal, Vol. 11, No. 3 (Summer, 1957), pages 324-327&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1985">The '''Sichuan Mongols''' are officially counted among the [[Mongols in China|Mongolian nationality in China]]. However, they are a distinct ethno-linguistic group from all other [[Mongolian people]]s. They call themselves Mongols and possess their own clothing, history and language. All other peoples in the region recognize them as Mongols (''Mengzu'').

The Sichuan Mongols' main religion is [[Tibetan Buddhism]]. A sizable temple remains in active use just behind the prince's house. Most temples and altars being destroyed during the [[Cultural Revolution]] but many of them were recovered afterwards. Most Sichuan Mongols are farmers or fishermen, leading quiet lives in their remote villages. They observe [[Buddhist festival]]s.

Historically, the Mongols in [[Yongning, Sichuan|Yongning]] were ruled by three chiefs, elevated to power by [[Kublai Khan]] in the 13th century. Before Communist rule, the Mongol monarch acted as a warlord over the whole region. When the [[Communists]] took over, they deposed him, not killing him so as not to make him a martyr in the people's eyes. The Mongol palace was destroyed and the prince was sent to a reeducation camp for several years. The prince, La Ping Chu, is still alive today and respected by his people, although he is not allowed to rule. Many older Mongols still bow their heads in respect when they pass him on the street.

[[File:Clare College, Cambridge, July 2010 (16).JPG|thumb|Clare College, University of Cambridge a regular venue for the Social Stratification Seminars.]]
The '''Social Stratification Research Seminar (UK)''' is an annual research colloquium for original, empirically informed [[Sociology|sociological]] presentations on [[social stratification]]. The Social Stratification Research Seminars have been running almost every autumn since 1968. The seminars have mainly been hosted at the [[University of Cambridge]] and were often organised by the [https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/social-science-research-group Social Science Research Group (formerly the Sociological Research Group)]. The seminars have also been held at the [[Cardiff University|University of Cardiff (]]2003-5), the [[University of Edinburgh]] (2014, 2017), the [[University of Milan]] (2015), the [[University of Stirling]] (2007, 2011) and [[Utrecht University]] (2010).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.camsis.stir.ac.uk/stratif/conf_archive.html&lt;/ref&gt;

The original movers and shakers behind the seminar were three distinguished British scholars working in the field of social stratification - [https://research.sociology.cam.ac.uk/profile/professor-robert-martin-bob-blackburn Professor Robert (Bob) Blackburn],  [https://www.fitz.cam.ac.uk/about/people/fellows-profiles/professor-ken-prandy Professor Ken Prandy,] and Professor Alexander (Sandy) Stewart. Since the early part of this [[Year 2000|millennium]] the seminar has been organised by [https://www.stir.ac.uk/people/255764 Professor Paul Lambert], who is Professor of Sociology at the [[University of Stirling]] and a longstanding fan of [[Stirling Albion F.C.|Stirling Albion F.C]]. The annual call for papers is usually issued in the spring and the seminar is usually held on two consecutive days in the early September. Proposals for papers for presentations are invited from any area of research into social stratification and social inequality.  The organizers do not usually limit the number of delegates attending. There are no parallel sessions and therefore there is an upper limit on the number of paper presentations that can be accommodated.

A salient feature of the Social Stratification Research Seminars has been how to appropriately measure social stratification in contemporary societies. An approach that has been developed by researchers who are regular contributors to the seminars are Social Interaction and Stratification Scales.&lt;ref&gt;See Stewart, A., PRANDY, K. and Blackburn, R.M., 1973. Measuring the class structure. ''Nature'', ''245''(5426), p.415.&lt;/ref&gt; This approach is the foundation of the [http://www.camsis.stir.ac.uk/ CAMSIS Project] which is an internationally comparative assessment of the structures of social interaction and stratification across a number of countries.

A number of prominent research publications contain work that was developed and showcased at the seminars. These works include an edited volume entitled [https://www.routledge.com/Social-Stratification-Trends-and-Processes/Connelly-Gayle-Lambert/p/book/9781409430964 ''Social stratification:Trends and processes'']&lt;ref&gt;Lambert, P., Connelly, M.R., Blackburn, R.M. and Gayle, V. eds., 2013.

The '''Solzhenitsyn Aid Fund''' (officially '''Russian Public Fund to Aid Political Prisoners and their Families''', also '''Fund for the Aid of Political Prisoners''', '''Public Aid Fund''') was a charity foundation and support network set up by [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]] and [[Alexander Ginzburg]] that distributed funds and material support to [[Political prisoner|political]] and religious prisoners across the [[Soviet Union]] throughout the 1970s and 1980s.

== Founding ==

The fund was formed on the initiative of writer and [[political prisoner]] Alexander Ginzburg. Families of arrested [[Soviet dissidents|dissidents]] often suffered repercussions such as the loss of jobs and opportunities to study. During his time in [[labor camp]]s, Ginzburg managed to coordinate relatives and friends to help other inmates and their families. This included support such as donating household goods for those in exile, helping relatives who faced expulsion from work, or offering places to stay in Moscow for wives who journeyed to visit their husbands in remote Siberian camps.

After his release in 1972, Ginzburg consulted with Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn on how to continue this informal support. Solzhenitsyn offered a quarter of his [[Nobel Prize in Literature|Nobel Prize]] award for the cause. After Solzhenitsyn was expelled from the USSR in 1974 following the publication of ''[[The Gulag Archipelago]]'', he set up a fund in Switzerland, donating all present and future international royalties for the book to it. The funds were from then on brought into the USSR and distributed through a network of volunteers.&lt;ref name="kifa"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = http://gazetakifa.ru/content/view/295/|title = Делай то, что без тебя сделано не будет.

== Activities ==
A first goal of the fund was to help [[gulag]] inmates and their families to survive. For this, groups of people, unknown to one another, collected information on the existence and whereabouts of political prisoners across the Soviet Union and distributed funds and other material support to them and their families. Other charitable organizations, such as Christian Orthodox organizations that collected clothing and other items, passed those donations onto the Aid Fund for redistribution. The Aid Fund also contributed funds for the support of political prisoners who were sent to [[Political abuse of psychiatry in the Soviet Union|psychiatric imprisonment]]. It paid for the travel expenses of those who traveled to distant trials to support the political dissenters.&lt;ref name=walker-altruism&gt;{{Cite book| isbn = 9781137289834| pages = 180–203| last1 = Lim| first1 = Jie-Hyun| last2 = Walker| first2 = Barbara| last3 = Lambert| first3 = Peter| last4 = Walker, Barbara| title = Mass Dictatorship and Memory as Ever Present Past| chapter = Accomplices of Violence: Guilt and Purification through Altruism among the Moscow Human Rights Activists of the 1960s and 1970s| date = 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|189}} A second goal of the fund was the support of cultural initiatives, such as a series of memoirs of emigrants.&lt;ref name="kifa" /&gt;

The administrators of the fund ensured that the money was sent legally to banks in Moscow; after the state had taken one third in tax, what remained was distributed in roubles. When the authorities found out about the fund, the receiving of the money was blocked. Instead, donations were sent to friends and sympathisers. The [[KGB]] then attempted to halt its distribution by telling the families of political prisoners that, if money were accepted, their loved ones would endure even worse conditions in the camps.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Alexander Ginsburg|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1402107/Alexander-Ginsburg.html|website = Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Solzhenitsyn's wife Natalya, the fund counted up to 120 volunteers.&lt;ref name=kifa /&gt;

== Post-Soviet Russia ==
The Aid Fund was revived in the 1990s. It supports impoverished former dissenters.&lt;ref name="walker-altruism" /&gt;{{Rp|190}} It also instituted a support program for Russian libraries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ходорович|first1=Сергей|title=Люди Русского фонда|journal=Журнал Неволя|date=2007|volume=13|accessdate=1 December 2015|url=http://index.org.ru/nevol/2007-13/hodorovich_n13.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s the Swedish Ido Association was one of the largest associations in Sweden that advocated the usage of a universal language. The association had about 200 exercising and 100 supporting members.&lt;ref&gt;Periodical Röster i Radio, No 3 March 1933&lt;/ref&gt; The association published periodicals and literature in Ido.

==Usage==
Oligarchs are usually defined as businessmen having direct influence on both [[Politics of Ukraine|politics]] and economy. During the 1990s, the oligarchs emerged as well-connected [[Nouveau riche|entrepreneurs who started from nearly nothing and got rich]] through participation in the market via connections to the corrupt, but democratically elected government of Ukraine during the state's transition to a [[market economy|market-based economy]]. Later numerous Ukrainian businesspeople have "taken over control" of political parties (examples of this are [[Party of Greens of Ukraine]], [[Labour Ukraine]] and [[Social Democratic Party of Ukraine (united)]]&lt;ref name=Andrew/&gt;) or started new ones to gain seats and influence in the [[Verkhovna Rada]] (Ukrainian parliament).

The rise of the oligarchs has been connected to the processes of [[privatization]] of state-owned assets. These processes usually involved the distribution of [[property title]]s of such enterprises, land, and real estate, on equal base to the whole population of the country, through instruments such as [[privatization voucher]]s, certificates, and coupons. Given the different preferences of people in relation to risk-aversity, property titles were easily re-sold. Businessmen who could provide an initial investment capital to collect such property titles could thus easily arrive to the property of whole former public holdings.

The oligarchs' influence on the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian Government]] is extreme. In 2011 some analysts and Ukrainian politicians believed that some Ukrainian businesses tycoons, with "lucrative relations" with [[Russia]], were deliberately hindering [[Ukraine–European Union relations|Ukraine's European Union integration]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kyivpost.com/news/nation/detail/119066/ EU Hopes Fade As Gas Lobby Triumphs], [[Kyiv Post]] (16 December 2011)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Most influential==
In January 2001 only two people of this list were seen as being an oligarch by the general public (Lazarenko and Tymoshenko, topping a [[Kyiv International Institute of Sociology]] survey in January 2001).&lt;ref name=Takuzio&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Rr3aAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA1-PT29&amp;dq=Pavlo+Lazarenko+Fatherland+faction&amp;hl=nl&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=GQBoUv_nHIPUtAaOhYC4AQ&amp;ved=0CDIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pavlo%20Lazarenko%20Fatherland%20faction&amp;f=false Democratic Revolution in Ukraine: From Kuchmagate to Orange Revolution] by [[Taras Kuzio]], [[Routledge]], 2009, {{ISBN|0415441412}} (chapter 4)&lt;/ref&gt;{{synthesis-inline|date=May 2017}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7229">'''Vernon Lee Evans''' is a [[contract killer]] convicted for murdering two witnesses scheduled to testify against the leader of a drug gang. In 1984, he was convicted and sentenced to death together with [[drug lord|drug kingpin]] [[Anthony Grandison]] for the 1983 murders of Susan Kennedy and David Scott Piechowicz. David Piechowicz and his wife Cheryl (Susan Kennedy's sister) had been scheduled to testify against Grandison at trial on federal drug charges.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indybay.org/news/2006/02/1800526.php|title=DP Victory in Maryland - Vernon Evans Wins Stay of Execution!|publisher=The AP|date=|accessdate=2006-02-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was intensely discussed in the political debate about eliminating the death penalty in Maryland.&lt;ref name="WagnerIssue"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wagner|first1=John|title=5 inmates on death row are at issue|url=https://search.proquest.com/news/docview/1324365374/fulltext/FB02A45CACA847D7PQ/88?accountid=10226|accessdate=29 May 2018|publisher=Washington Post|date=8 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conviction and sentencing==

Evans' death sentence was overturned on appeal in 1991. The following year, a new jury again sentenced him to die.&lt;ref name="LevineDate"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Levine|first1=Susan|title=A Shorter Line on Death Row; Pr. George's Man May Be Months From Execution Date|url=https://search.proquest.com/news/docview/409627652/FB02A45CACA847D7PQ/84?accountid=10226|accessdate=29 May 2018|publisher=Washingotn Post|date=19 June 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, the new sentence was upheld on direct appeal to the [[Maryland Court of Appeals]], and in 1997 a petition for post-conviction relief was denied. The U.S. District Court for the District of Maryland denied Evans' federal habeas corpus petition in 1999, and in 2000 that decision was upheld by the Court of Appeals for the 4th Circuit. Since then, Evans has filed motions for a new trial and to correct an illegal sentence. Those, however, have been denied as well. He was scheduled for execution in February 2006, but his execution was suspended. All executions in Maryland are currently on hold until the state drafts and approves new execution procedures.

The status of Evens' death sentence became unclear along with that of four other convicted murderers when the [[Maryland House of Delegates]] voted in 2013 to abolish the death penalty.&lt;ref name="GuardianLimbo"&gt;{{cite news|title=End of death penalty leaves five in limbo|url=https://search.proquest.com/news/docview/1319797560/fulltext/FB02A45CACA847D7PQ/59?accountid=10226|accessdate=29 May 2018|publisher=The Guardian|date=22 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On December 31, 2014, Evans' death sentence was one of four commuted to life without parole by outgoing governor [[Martin O'Malley]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcnews.com/news/us-news/maryland-gov-martin-omalley-commutes-four-death-sentences-n277551 ''Maryland Gov.

==Anti death penalty activism==
Concern that anti death penalty activists would protest Evans execution violently, Maryland State Police carried out undercover surveillance of anti death penalty activists for fourteen months.  The operation was ended when it came to light; Governor [[Martin O'Malley]] called it an "infring(ment) on citizens' rights to free speech or public assembly."&lt;ref name="ReinJudgement"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rein|first1=Lisa|title=Anticipated Death Penalty Protests Prompted Spying; Md.

While on death row, anti death penalty activists enabled Evans to write an advice blog designed, according to the [[Chicago Tribune]] as "the leading edge of a strategy by death penalty opponents to use new technologies" by making the public see criminals sentenced to death as "human beings with lives beyond the crimes they are accused of."&lt;ref name="RichAdvice"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rich|first1=Eric|title=Via blog, man on Death Row gives advice|url=https://search.proquest.com/news/docview/420420620/FB02A45CACA847D7PQ/12?accountid=10226|accessdate=29 May 2018|publisher=Chicago Tribune|date=29 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="McMenaminLife"&gt;{{cite news|last1=McMenamin|first1=Jennifer|title=Answers sent from death row ; Evans' blog gives a glimpse of his life|url=https://search.proquest.com/news/docview/406673143/821877B5049E45FCPQ/1?accountid=10226|accessdate=29 May 2018|publisher=Baltimore Sun|date=27 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BorgerMan"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borger|first1=Julian|title=Death row blogger describes last days of condemned man|url=https://search.proquest.com/news/docview/246395804/821877B5049E45FCPQ/3?accountid=10226|accessdate=29 May 2018|publisher=[[The Guardian]]|date=28 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LastDays"&gt;{{cite news|title=Deathrow inmate blogs in last days|url=https://search.proquest.com/news/docview/467783295/fulltext/FB02A45CACA847D7PQ/62?accountid=10226|accessdate=29 May 2018|publisher=UPI|date=27 January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="JohnsonSpirituality"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Johnson|first1=Andre|title=Urban God Talk: Constructing a Hip Hop Spirituality|date=2013|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=0739168304|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his blog, Evans claimed not to have committed the murder.&lt;ref name="RichAdvice"/&gt;
