'''Abd Al Aziz Awda''', also known as '''Abd al-Aziz Uda''' or '''Sheik Odeh''' (born 20 December 1950) is a [[Palestinian people|Palestinian]] and one of the founders of the [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine]], also known as Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), which is deemed by the [[United States]] to be an international terrorist organization.

Awda was listed as a "[[Specially Designated Terrorist]]" under United States law on 23 January 1995. A decade later, Awda was among the second and most recent group of indicted fugitives to be added to the [[FBI Most Wanted Terrorists]] list on 24 February 2006, along with PIJ secretary-general [[Ramadan Shalah]].&lt;ref name="24threlease"&gt;[https://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel06/mostwantedterrorists022406.htm FBI Updates Most Wanted Terrorists and Seeking Information – War on Terrorism Lists] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090805113636/http://www.fbi.gov/pressrel/pressrel06/mostwantedterrorists022406.htm |date=2009-08-05 }}, ''FBI national Press Release'', 24 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Awda is the spiritual leader of the PIJ and is still involved in the organization, which has its headquarters located in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]], where he likely still resides, along with other leaders of Palestinian Islamic Jihad.

==Early life and education==
Awda was born on 20 December 1950 in [[Jabalia]], a village just south of the city of [[Beit Lahia]], in the [[Gaza Strip]].&lt;ref name="FBIBio"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.fbi.gov/wanted/wanted_terrorists/abd-al-aziz-awda |title=FBI Most Wanted Terrorists - Abd Al Aziz Awda |publisher=[[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] |date=29 September 2010 |accessdate=9 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Awda was educated in Arab and [[Islamic studies]] in [[Cairo]], [[Egypt]].&lt;ref name="FBIBio"/&gt; He later worked as a lecturer at a university and as an [[Imam]] at a [[mosque]], both of which were located in the Gaza Strip.&lt;ref name="FBIBio"/&gt;

==Palestinian Islamic Jihad activity==
Awda and [[Fathi Shaqaqi]] founded [[Islamic Jihad Movement in Palestine]], also known as Palestinian Islamic Jihad (PIJ), when it was formed in the Gaza Strip during the 1970s as a branch of the [[Egyptian Islamic Jihad]].&lt;ref name="Wiktorowicz2004"&gt;{{cite book|author=Quintan Wiktorowicz|title=Islamic Activism: A Social Movement Theory Approach|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UoONJqsjYjcC&amp;pg=PA112|accessdate=14 December 2012|year=2004|publisher=Indiana University Press|isbn=978-0-253-21621-2|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt; Awda also became known as the group's spiritual leader.

Awda was listed as a "[[Specially Designated Terrorist]]" under United States law on 23 January 1995. Later that year, Shaqaqi was assassinated in [[Malta]] in 1995, and was replaced as secretary-general of PIJ by Ramadan Shalah, who then joined Awda on the U.S. "Specially Designated Terrorist" list on 27 November 1995.

Fellow PIJ members Awda and Shalah were both indicted in a 53 count indictment in the [[United States District Court for the Middle District of Florida]], [[Tampa, Florida|Tampa]], [[Florida]], on [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) charges of alleged involvement in racketeering activities for the designated international terrorist organization known as Palestinian Islamic Jihad. Awda is wanted for conspiracy to conduct the affairs of the PIJ through a pattern of racketeering activities such as bombings, murders, extortions, and money laundering. For that indictment, Awda and Shalah then became two of six alleged and indicted terrorist fugitives among the second and most recent group of indicted fugitives to be added to the [[FBI Most Wanted Terrorists]] on 24 February 2006.

The [[Federal Bureau of Investigation]] (FBI) states that Awda is still involved in PIJ, which has its headquarters located in [[Damascus]], [[Syria]], where Awda likely remains as well. His other aliases listed by the FBI include Abdel Aziz Odeh, Abd Al Aziz Odeh, Abed Al Aziz Odeh, Abu Ahmed, Sheik Awda, Fadl Abu Ahmed, Al Sheik, The Sheik, and Mawlana.

'''Ancient Fishweir Project''' is a collaborative group that creates an annual public art installation on [[Boston Common]]. 

==Description==
In the spring of each year, members of the [[Massachusett]] and [[Wampanoag people|Wampanoag]] Native American tribes work with students, educators and artists to construct a [[fish-weir]] in honor of the people who built fishweirs 3500 to 5200 years BP ([[Before Present]]) in the area that is now urban Boston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ancienthunter.com/?p%3D177|title=The Ancient Fishweir Project Part II |accessdate=July 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110707140731/http://ancienthunter.com/?p=177 |archivedate=July 7, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Today this fishweir re-creation is located on dry land near what was once an early shoreline that existed when ocean levels were lower and before new land was made by fill of the [[Back Bay]] tidal estuary that began in the Colonial period.

The fishweir construction is based on archeological discovery of wooden stakes from fishweirs, including the [[Boylston Street Fishweir]], that are still buried under the streets of the [[Back Bay, Boston]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=oy6nK0ZdqksC&amp;pg=PA11&amp;lpg=PA11&amp;dq=ancient+fishweir+project&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=0JBxKnjtC0&amp;sig=U9sjZO-EOE_f2OP-X6Mn1ViSxdc&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=58AuSqCVH4-UMuCD8YUK&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=5#|title=Boston's Back Bay|page=11|website=Books.google.com|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The early fishweirs, fence-like structures of wood and brush, were built in tidal flats to catch [[alewife]], [[smelts|smelt]], and [[herring]] during the spring [[Spawn (biology)|spawn]].

The time of the spring fish spawn, and the beginning of new growing season, is traditionally considered the New Year for Wampanoag and Massachuset people. In traditional culture it is said that the fish return to spawn in the streams when “the oak leaf is as big as a mouse’s ear”.

Initiators of the Ancient Fishweir Project include Gill Solomon, Sachem of the Massachuset Tribe;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.boston.com/ae/books/articles/2008/05/18/guided_by_the_spoken_cadence_of_history|title=Guided by the spoken cadence of history|website=Boston.com|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Ross Miller (artist)|Ross Miller]]; Dena Dincauze, archeologist;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.library.umass.edu/spcoll/umarmot/?p=632|title=Dincauze, Dena Ferran • SCUA • UMass Amherst Libraries|website=Library.umass.edu|accessdate=19 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ellen Berkland, Archeologist for the City of Boston; and Annawon Weedon and Jim Peters of the Wampanoag Tribe.

Annual building of the fishweir on [[Boston Common]], the oldest public common in the country (1634), challenges assumptions of the history that is currently taught.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.friendsofthepublicgarden.org/kids/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=July 5, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090319052446/http://www.friendsofthepublicgarden.org/kids/ |archivedate=March 19, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Construction of the fishweir is supported by educational programs and teacher workshops in collaboration with [[Boston Children's Museum]]. Lectures and on-site music and dance performance events provide interpretation of the history for students and the public.&lt;ref&gt;

Greece has a significant Arab population of about 30,800 people.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} Mainly from Egypt, Libyans, Iraqis and Lebanon. There are also many Arabs from Syria, Palestine, Jordan, Morocco, Algeria and Tunisia. The majority tend to live in [[Athens]] and [[Thessaloniki]]. However, they can be found in all the parts of the country.

In addition, Greece has people from Arab countries, who have the status of refugees (e.g. [[refugees of the Syrian civil war]]) or illegal immigrants (Algerians of mainly Berber descent and usually mistakenly called Arabs) trying to immigrate to Western Europe.

==Arabs and the Byzantine Empire==
In 904, the Arabs sacked Thessaloniki, their greatest achievement in Greece, while four years later they were defeated by Byzantine general Himerios in the Aegean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Historical Studies|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=wMGGAAAAIAAJ|year=1965|publisher=Bowes &amp; Bowes|page=65}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nikephoros Phokas]] noted in 961 the increase of Arabs in Greece.&lt;ref name="Commissionnumismatica1961"&gt;{{cite book|author1=International Numismatic Commission|author2=Istituto italiano di numismatica|title=Congresso internazionale di numismatica, Roma, 11-16 settembre 1961: Atti|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S0hmAAAAMAAJ|year=1961|publisher=Istituto italiano di numismatica|page=486}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Baloch are an ethnic group in [[Pakistan]], [[Iran]], [[Afghanistan]] and [[Arab]] countries. Mostly the Baluch are tribal and have often fought amongst themselves throughout history. {{fact|date=June 2018}}

==The 30 year war==
The 30-year war was an intra Baloch conflict lasting almost 30-year-long and fought between the forces of [[Mir Chakar Khan Rind]] (tribal ruler) and [[Mir Gwaharam Khan Lashari]] in 15th century CE.

Mir Chakar Rind lived in Sevi (modern city of [[Sibi]]) in the hills of Balochistan and became the head of [[Rind (tribe)|Rind tribe]] at the age of 18 after the death of his father Mir Shehak Khan. Mir Chakar's kingdom was short-lived because of a civil war between the Lashari and Rind tribes of [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Provinces of Pakistan (Balochistan)|author=Overseas Pakistan Foundation|work=Encyclopedia of Pakistan|url=http://www.opf.org.pk/almanac/P/provinces.htm|access-date=2008-10-02|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081121021120/http://www.opf.org.pk/almanac/P/provinces.htm|archive-date=2008-11-21|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mir Chakar Rind and Mir Gwaharam Khan Lashari, head of the Lashari tribe, went to war that resulted in thousands dead, including Mir Chakar's brother. The war and the gallantry of the two tribe leaders continues to be a part of the Baloch peoples' history.  After the "Thirty Years' War" against the Lashari Tribe,&lt;ref name=googlebook&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=lodSckjlNuMC&amp;pg=PA305&amp;lpg=PA305&amp;dq=thirty+year+war+lashari&amp;source=web&amp;ots=OLwjMQYuv2&amp;sig=M5xuY8ht9jIDwXhoW-rs4zCUESI History of Civilizations of Central Asia] By [[Ahmad Hasan Dani]], Vadim Mikhaĭlovich Masson, János (Google Books)&lt;/ref&gt; Mir Chakar Rind left [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]] and settled in the [[Punjab region]] in 1518 with other rind tribes. these tribes are settle in southern,central Punjab.

Benzodiazepines have been abused both orally and intravenously. Different benzodiazepines have different abuse potential; the more rapid the increase in the plasma level following ingestion, the greater the intoxicating effect and the more open to abuse the drug becomes. The speed of onset of action of a particular benzodiazepine correlates well with the ‘popularity’ of that drug for abuse. The two most common reasons for preference were that a benzodiazepine was ‘strong’ and that it gave a good ‘high’.&lt;ref name="Australian Government 2006"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.legislation.act.gov.au/ni/2006-175/current/pdf/2006-175.pdf | title = ACT MEDICAL BOARD&amp;nbsp;– STANDARDS STATEMENT&amp;nbsp;– PRESCRIBING OF BENZODIAZEPINES | accessdate = 13 September 2011 | author = Australian Government | authorlink = Australian Government |author2=Medical Board | year = 2006 | format = pdf | publisher = ACT medical board | location = Australia }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Dr. Chris Ford, former clinical director of Substance Misuse Management in General Practice, among [[drugs of abuse]], benzodiazepines are often seen as the 'bad guys' by drug and alcohol workers. Illicit users of benzodiazepines have been found to take higher [[methadone]] doses, as well as showing more HIV/HCV risk-taking behavior, greater poly-drug use, higher levels of psychopathology and social dysfunction. However, there is only limited research into the adverse effects of benzodiazepines in drug misusers and further research is needed to demonstrate whether this is the result of cause or effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exchangesupplies.org/conferences/NDTC/2009_NDTC/speakers/chris_ford.html |title=What is possible with benzodiazepines |author=Chris Ford |year=2009 |publisher=Exchange Supplies, 2009 National Drug Treatment Conference |location=UK }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
{{See also|Benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome|Benzodiazepine dependence}}
[[File:Addictiondependence1.png|thumbnail|Benzodiazepines can induce a severe [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] as well as [[Substance dependence|drug seeking behavior]].]]
Sedative-hypnotics such as alcohol, benzodiazepines, and the barbiturates are known for the severe [[physical dependence]] that they are capable of inducing which can result in severe withdrawal effects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.benzo.org.uk/can-drb.htm |title=Dr Ray Baker's Article on Addiction: Benzodiazepines in Particular |accessdate=14 February 2009 |author= Ray Baker}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} This severe neuroadaptation is even more profound in high dose drug users and misusers. A high degree of [[Drug tolerance|tolerance]] often occurs in chronic benzodiazepine abusers due to the typically high doses they consume which can lead to a severe [[benzodiazepine dependence]]. The [[benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome]] seen in chronic high dose benzodiazepine abusers is similar to that seen in therapeutic low dose users but of a more severe nature. Extreme antisocial behaviors in obtaining continued supplies and severe drug-seeking behavior when withdrawals occur. The severity of the benzodiazepine withdrawal syndrome has been described by one benzodiazepine drug misuser who stated that:&lt;ref name=baashton /&gt; &lt;blockquote&gt;I'd rather withdraw off heroin any day. If I was withdrawing from benzos you could offer me a gram of heroin or just 20mg of diazepam and I'd take the diazepam every time&amp;nbsp;– I've never been so frightened in my life.&lt;/blockquote&gt; Those who use benzodiazepines intermittently are less likely to develop a dependence and withdrawal symptoms upon dose reduction or cessation of benzodiazepines than those who use benzodiazepines on a daily basis.&lt;ref name=baashton /&gt;

Misuse of benzodiazepines is widespread amongst drug misusers; however, many of these people will not require withdrawal management as their use is often restricted to binges or occasional misuse. Benzodiazepine dependence when it occurs requires withdrawal treatment. There is little evidence of benefit from long-term substitution therapy of benzodiazepines, and conversely, there is growing evidence of the harm of [[long-term use of benzodiazepines]], especially higher doses. Therefore, gradual reduction is recommended, titrated against withdrawal symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nta.nhs.uk/publications/documents/clinical_guidelines_2007.pdf |title=Drug misuse and dependence&amp;nbsp;– UK guidelines on clinical management |author=National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse |authorlink=National Treatment Agency for Substance Misuse |year=2007 |publisher=Department of Health |location=United Kingdom |format=PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt; For withdrawal purposes, stabilisation with a long-acting agent such as diazepam is recommended before commencing withdrawal. [[Chlordiazepoxide]] (Librium), a long-acting benzodiazepine, is gaining attention as an alternative to diazepam in substance abusers dependent on benzodiazepines due to its decreased abuse potential.&lt;ref name=dah2006 /&gt; In individuals dependent on benzodiazepines who have been using benzodiazepines long-term, taper regimens of 6–12 months have been recommended and found to be more successful. More rapid detoxifications e.g. of a month are not recommended as they lead to more severe withdrawal symptoms.&lt;ref name=sudapg&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Gitlow | first1 = S. | title = Substance Use Disorders: A Practical Guide | url = https://books.google.com/?id=rbrSdWVerBUC | edition = 2nd | year = 2006 | publisher = Lippincott Williams and Wilkins | location = USA | isbn = 978-0-7817-6998-3 | pages = 103–121 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tolerance leads to a reduction in GABA receptors and function; when benzodiazepines are reduced or stopped this leads to an unmasking of these compensatory changes in the nervous system with the appearance of physical and mental withdrawal effects such as anxiety, insomnia, autonomic hyperactivity and possibly seizures.&lt;ref name="pmid10779253" /&gt;

All sedative-hypnotics, e.g. alcohol, barbiturates, benzodiazepines and the [[nonbenzodiazepine]] [[Z-drugs]] have a similar mechanism of action, working on the GABA&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; receptor complex and are [[cross tolerant]] with each other and also have abuse potential. Use of prescription sedative-hypnotics; for example the nonbenzodiazepine Z-drugs often leads to a relapse back into substance misuse with one author stating this occurs in over a quarter of those who have achieved abstinence.&lt;ref name=sudapg /&gt;

===Background===
Benzodiazepines are a commonly abused class of drugs, although there is debate as to whether certain benzodiazepines have higher abuse potential than others.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Dart | first1 = R. C. | title = Medical Toxicology | url = https://books.google.com/?id=qDf3AO8nILoC | edition = 3rd | year = 2003 | publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins | location = USA | isbn = 978-0-7817-2845-4 | page = 819 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In animal and human studies the abuse potential of benzodiazepines is classed as moderate in comparison to other drugs of abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Griffiths, R. R. |author2=Weerts, E. M. |title = Benzodiazepine Self-Administration in Humans and Laboratory Animals&amp;nbsp;– Implications for Problems of Long-Term Use and Abuse | journal = Psychopharmacology | volume = 134 | issue = 1 | pages = 1–37 |date=November 1997 | pmid = 9399364 | doi = 10.1007/s002130050422 | url = http://link.springer.de/link/service/journals/00213/bibs/7134001/71340001.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Benzodiazepines are commonly abused by [[poly drug users]], especially heroin [[Substance dependence|addicts]], [[alcoholics]] or [[amphetamine]] addicts when "coming down".&lt;ref name="J&amp;H"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jones|first=AW|author2=Holmgren A|title=Amphetamine abuse in Sweden: subject demographics, changes in blood concentrations over time, and the types of coingested substances|journal=Journal of Clinical Psychopharmacology|date=April 2013|volume=33|issue=2|pages=248–252|doi=10.1097/JCP.0b013e3182870310|pmid=23422398}}&lt;/ref&gt; but sometimes are misused in isolation as the primary drug of misuse. They can be misused to achieve the high that benzodiazepines produce or more commonly they are used to either enhance the effects of other [[CNS depressant]] drugs, to stave off [[Drug withdrawal|withdrawal]] effects of other drugs or combat the effects of [[stimulant]]s. As many as 30–50% of alcoholics are also benzodiazepine misusers.&lt;ref name=baashton&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.benzo.org.uk/ashbzab.htm | title = BENZODIAZEPINE ABUSE | work = Drugs and Dependence | accessdate = 25 September 2007 | author = Ashton, C. H. | year = 2002 | publisher = Harwood Academic Publishers }}&lt;/ref&gt; Drug abusers often abuse high doses which makes serious [[benzodiazepine withdrawal]] symptoms such as [[psychosis]] or [[convulsion]]s more likely to occur during withdrawal.

Benzodiazepine abuse increases risk-taking behaviors such as unprotected sex and sharing of needles amongst intravenous abusers of benzodiazepines. Abuse is also associated with blackouts, memory loss, aggression, violence, and chaotic behavior associated with paranoia. There is little support for long-term maintenance of benzodiazepine abusers and thus a withdrawal regime is indicated when benzodiazepine abuse becomes a [[substance dependence|dependence]]. The main source of illicit benzodiazepines are diverted benzodiazepines obtained originally on prescription; other sources include thefts from pharmacies and pharmaceutical warehouses. Benzodiazepine abuse is steadily increasing and is now a major public health problem. Benzodiazepine abuse is mostly limited to individuals who abuse other drugs, i.e. poly-drug abusers. Most prescribed users do not abuse their medication, however, some high dose prescribed users do become involved with the illicit drug scene. Abuse of benzodiazepines occurs in a wide age range of people and includes teenagers and the old. The abuse potential or drug-liking effects appears to be dose related, with low doses of benzodiazepines having limited drug liking effects but higher doses increasing the abuse potential/drug-liking properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | editor1-first = W. | editor1-last = Caan | editor2-first = J. | editor2-last = de Belleroche | title = Drink, Drugs and Dependence: From Science to Clinical Practice | url = https://books.google.com/?id=nPvbDUw4w5QC | edition = 1st | year = 2002 | publisher = Routledge | isbn = 978-0-415-27891-1 | pages = 197–211 | chapter = Benzodiazepine Abuse | chapterurl = https://books.google.com/books?id=nPvbDUw4w5QC&amp;pg=PA197 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health related complications===
{{See also|Long-term effects of benzodiazepines}}
Complications of benzodiazepine abuse include drug-related deaths due to overdose especially in combination with other depressant drugs such as [[opioids]]. Other complications include:  [[Fainting|blackouts]] and [[memory loss]],  [[paranoia]], violence and [[criminal behaviour]], risk-taking sexual behaviour, foetal and neonatal risks if taken in pregnancy,  [[drug dependence|dependence]], withdrawal [[seizure]]s and [[psychosis]]. Injection of the drug carries risk of: [[thrombophlebitis]], [[deep vein thrombosis]], deep and superficial [[abscess]]es, [[pulmonary]] [[microembolism]], [[rhabdomyolysis]], [[tissue necrosis]], [[gangrene]] requiring amputation, [[hepatitis]] B and C,  as well as blood borne infections such as [[HIV infection]] (caused by sharing injecting equipment).&lt;ref name=baashton /&gt; [[Long-term use of benzodiazepines]] can worsen pre-existing depression and [[anxiety]] and may potentially also cause dementia with impairments in recent and remote memory functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last1 = Galanter | first1 = M. |last2 = Kleber | first2 = H.

Use is widespread among [[amphetamine]] users, with those that use amphetamines and benzodiazepines having greater levels of mental health problems and social deterioration. Benzodiazepine injectors are almost four times more likely to inject using a shared needle than non-benzodiazepine-using injectors. It has been concluded in various studies that benzodiazepine use causes greater levels of risk and psycho-social dysfunction among drug misusers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Darke, S. |author2=Ross, J. |author3=Cohen, J. | title = The Use of Benzodiazepines among Regular Amphetamine Users | journal = [[Addiction (journal)|Addiction]] | volume = 89 | issue = 12 | pages = 1683–1690 | year = 1994 | pmid = 7866252 | doi = 10.1111/j.1360-0443.1994.tb03769.x }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Poly-drug users who also use benzodiazepines appear to engage in more frequent high-risk behaviors. Those who use stimulant and depressant drugs are more likely to report adverse reactions from stimulant use, more likely to be injecting [[stimulant]]s and more likely to have been treated for a drug problem than those using stimulant but not [[depressant]] drugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Williamson, S. |author2=Gossop, M. |author3=Powis, B. |author4=Griffiths, P. |author5=Fountain, J. |author6=Strang, J. | title = Adverse effects of stimulant drugs in a community sample of drug users | journal = Drug and Alcohol Dependence | volume = 44 | issue = 2–3 | pages = 87–94 | year = 1997 | pmid = 9088780 | doi = 10.1016/S0376-8716(96)01324-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Risk factors==
{{See also|List of benzodiazepines}}
Individuals with a [[substance abuse]] history are at an increased risk of misusing benzodiazepines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Hoffmann–La Roche |authorlink=Hoffmann–La Roche |title=Mogadon |url=http://www.rxmed.com/b.main/b2.pharmaceutical/b2.1.monographs/CPS-%20Monographs/CPS-%20(General%20Monographs-%20M)/MOGADON.html |publisher=RxMed |accessdate=26 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several (primary research) studies, even into the last decade, claimed, that individuals with a history of familial abuse of alcohol or who are siblings or children of alcoholics appeared to respond differently to benzodiazepines than so called ''genetically healthy'' persons, with males experiencing increased euphoric effects and females having exaggerated responses to the adverse effects of benzodiazepines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmid = 3417618 |date=Sep 1988 | title = Abuse liability and clinical pharmacokinetics of alprazolam in alcoholic men | volume = 49 | issue = 9 | pages = 333–337 | journal = The Journal of Clinical Psychiatry |url= |author1 = Ciraulo, D.

Whilst all benzodiazepines have abuse potential, certain characteristics increase the potential of particular benzodiazepines for abuse. These characteristics are chiefly practical ones—most especially, availability (often based on popular perception of 'dangerous' versus 'non-dangerous' drugs) through prescribing physicians or illicit distributors. Pharmacological and pharmacokinetic factors are also crucial in determining abuse potentials. A short [[elimination half-life]], high potency and a rapid onset of action are characteristics which increase the abuse potential of benzodiazepines.&lt;ref name="pmid10779253"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Longo, L.

&lt;nowiki&gt;**&lt;/nowiki&gt;The duration of apparent action is usually considerably less than the half-life. With most benzodiazepines, noticeable effects usually wear off within a few hours. Nevertheless, as long as the drug is present it will exert subtle effects within the body. These effects may become apparent during continued use or may appear as withdrawal symptoms when dosage is reduced or the drug is stopped.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

==Epidemiology==
Little attention has focused on the degree that benzodiazepines are abused as a primary drug of choice, but they are frequently abused alongside other drugs of abuse, especially alcohol, stimulants and opiates.&lt;ref name=dah2006&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Karch | first1 = S.

==Society and culture==

===Drug-related crime===
{{See also|Drug-related crime}}
Problem benzodiazepine use can be associated with various [[deviance (sociology)|deviant behavior]]s, including [[drug-related crime]]. In a survey of police detainees carried out by the Australian Government, both legal and illegal users of benzodiazepines were found to be more likely to have lived on the streets, less likely to have been in full-time work and more likely to have used heroin or [[methamphetamine]]s in the past 30 days from the date of taking part in the survey. Benzodiazepine users were also more likely to be receiving illegal incomes and more likely to have been arrested or imprisoned in the previous year. Benzodiazepines were sometimes reported to be used alone, but most often formed part of a poly drug-using problem. Female users were more likely than men to be using heroin, whereas male users were more likely to report amphetamine use. Benzodiazepine users were more likely than non-users to claim government financial benefits and benzodiazepine users who were also poly-drug users were the most likely to be claiming government financial benefits. Those who reported using benzodiazepines alone were found to be in the mid-range when compared to other drug using patterns in terms of property crimes and criminal breaches. Of the detainees reporting benzodiazepine use, one in five reported injection use, mostly of illicit [[temazepam]], with some who reported injecting prescribed benzodiazepines. The injection was a concern in this survey due to increased health risks. The main problems highlighted in this survey were concerns of [[drug dependence|dependence]], the potential for overdose of benzodiazepines in combination with [[opiates]] and the health problems associated with injection of benzodiazepines.&lt;ref name="urlwww.aic.gov.au"&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.aic.gov.au/documents/4/3/3/%7B4336A1AE-AFEC-4D82-A1D9-EB94ECC5B008%7Dtandi336.pdf | title = Benzodiazepine use and harms among police detainees in Australia | author = Loxley, W. | year = 2007 | format = pdf | isbn = 978-1-921185-39-7 | journal = Trends &amp; Issues in Crime and Criminal Justice | issue = 336 | accessdate = 2009-06-10 | publisher = Australian Institute of Criminology | location = Canberra, A.C.T. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benzodiazepines are also sometimes used for drug facilitated sexual assaults and robbery, however, alcohol remains the most common drug involved in drug facilitated assaults. The muscle relaxant, disinhibiting and amnesia producing effects of benzodiazepines are the pharmacological properties which make these drugs effective in drug-facilitated crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal  | last1 = Schwartz | first1 = R.

In a 2017 publication, an analysis of the blood samples of 22 victims of drug-facilitated robberies in Bangladesh revealed that criminals use different mixtures of Benzodiazepines including Lorazepam, Midazolam, Diazepam and Nordiazepam to immobilize and then rob their victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ariful|first1=Basher,|last2=Abul|first2=Faiz, M|last3=M|first3=Arif, Syed|last4=MAK|first4=Khandaker,|last5=Ulrich|first5=Kuch,|last6=SW|first6=Toennes,|title=Toxicological Screening of Drug Facilitated Crime among Travelers in Dhaka, Bangladesh|journal=Asia Pacific Journal of Medical Toxicology|date=20 June 2017|volume=6|issue=2|doi=10.22038/apjmt.2017.8949|url=http://apjmt.mums.ac.ir/article_8949.html|accessdate=1 September 2017|issn=2322-2611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Drug regulation and enforcement===

====Europe====
[[Temazepam]] abuse and seizures have been falling in the UK probably due to its reclassification as Schedule 3 [[controlled drug]] with tighter prescribing restrictions and the resultant reduction in availability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland.gov.uk/Resource/Doc/226306/0061258.pdf | title = Statistical Bulletin&amp;nbsp;– Drug Seizures by Scottish Police Forces, 2005/2006 and 2006/2007 | accessdate = 13 February 2009 | author = The Scottish Government | authorlink = Scottish Government | date = 3 June 2008 | format = pdf | work = Crime and Justice Series | publisher = scotland.gov.uk | location = Scotland }}&lt;/ref&gt;
A total of 2.75 million temazepam capsules were seized in the Netherlands by authorities between 1996 and 1999.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.incb.org/pdf/e/ar/1999/incb_report_1999_2.pdf | title = Operation of the international drug control system | accessdate = 13 February 2009 | author = INCB | authorlink = INCB |date=January 1999 | format = pdf | publisher = incb.org }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Northern Ireland]] statistics of individuals attending drug addiction treatment centers found that benzodiazepines were the 2nd most commonly reported main problem drugs (31 percent of attendees). Cannabis was the top with 35 percent of individuals reporting it as their main problem drug. The statistics showed that treatment for benzodiazepines as the main problematic drug had more than doubled from the previous year and was a growing problem in Northern Ireland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author = Northern Ireland Government | title = Statistics from the Northern Ireland Drug Misuse Database: 1 April 2007&amp;nbsp;– 31 March 2008 | url = http://www.dhsspsni.gov.uk/dmd_bulletin_2007-08.pdf | publisher = Department of Health and Social Services and Public Safety | location = Northern Ireland | format = pdf |date=October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Oceania====
Benzodiazepines are common drugs of abuse in Australia and New Zealand, particularly among those who may also be using other illicit drugs. The intravenous use of temazepam poses the greatest threat to those who misuse benzodiazepines. Simultaneous consumption of temazepam with heroin is a potential risk factor of overdose. An Australian study of non-fatal heroin overdoses noted that 26% of heroin users had consumed temazepam at the time of their overdose. This is consistent with an NSW investigation of coronial files from 1992. [[Temazepam]] was found in 26% of heroin-related deaths. Temazepam, including tablet formulations, are used intravenously. In an Australian study of 210 heroin users who used temazepam, 48% had injected it. Although abuse of benzodiazepines has decreased over the past few years, temazepam continues to be a major drug of abuse in Australia. In certain states like Victoria and Queensland, temazepam accounts for most benzodiazepine sought by forgery of prescriptions and through pharmacy burglary. Darke, Ross &amp; Hall found that different benzodiazepines have different abuse potential. The more rapid the increase in the plasma level following ingestion, the greater the intoxicating effect and the more open to abuse the drug becomes. The speed of onset of action of a particular benzodiazepine correlates well with the ‘popularity’ of that drug for abuse. The two most common reasons for preference for a benzodiazepine were that it was the ‘strongest’ and that it gave a good ‘high’.&lt;ref name="Australian Government 2006"/&gt;

====North America====
The most frequently abused of the benzodiazepines in both the United States and Canada are [[alprazolam]], [[clonazepam]], [[lorazepam]] and [[diazepam]].&lt;ref name=dawn2neodredv&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/files/ed2006/DAWN2k6ED.htm |title=Drug Abuse Warning Network, 2006: National Estimates of Drug-Related Emergency Department Visits |accessdate=9 February 2009 |author=United States Government |authorlink=samhsa |author2=U.S. Department of Health and Human Services |year=2006 |publisher=Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090118110454/http://dawninfo.samhsa.gov/files/ED2006/DAWN2k6ED.htm |archivedate=18 January 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====East and Southeast Asia====
The [[Central Narcotics Bureau]] of Singapore seized 94,200 [[nimetazepam]] tablets in 2003. This is the largest nimetazepam seizure recorded since nimetazepam became a controlled drug under the Misuse of Drugs Act in 1992. In Singapore [[nimetazepam]] is a Class C controlled drug.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.cnb.gov.sg/drugsituationreport/drugsituationreport2003.aspx | title = Drug Situation Report 2003 | accessdate = 23 September 2011 | author = Central Narcotics Bureau | authorlink = Central Narcotics Bureau |author2=Singapore Government | year = 2003 | publisher = cnb.gov.sg | location = Singapore }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Hong Kong abuse of prescription medicinal preparations continued in 2006 and seizures of midazolam (120,611 tablets), nimetazepam/nitrazepam (17,457 tablets), triazolam (1,071 tablets), diazepam (48,923 tablets) and chlordiazepoxide (5,853 tablets) were made. Heroin addicts used such tablets (crushed and mixed with heroin) to prolong the effect of the narcotic and ease withdrawal symptoms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.nd.gov.hk/text/en/report/pdf/2006/chapter4_e.pdf | title = Suppression of Illicit Trafficking and Manufacturing | accessdate = 13 February 2009 | author = Hong Kong Government | authorlink = Hong Kong Government | format = pdf | publisher = nd.gov.hk | location = Hong Kong }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal status==
Prior to Brunei's independence, the country's investment portfolio was administered by the [[The Crown|British Crown]].&lt;ref name="Sidhu2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sidhu|first=Jatswan S.|title=Historical Dictionary of Brunei Darussalam|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Bry0sOwstIMC&amp;pg=PA87|date=22 December 2009|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=978-0-8108-7078-9|pages=87–}}&lt;/ref&gt; The BIA was established under an Act of the Government of Brunei and became functional from 1 July 1983.

The objective defined under the Act is to hold and manage the General Reserve Fund of the Government and all its external assets. The agency manages 40% of Brunei's foreign reserves, remainder being managed by eight foreign organizations.&lt;ref name=Gunn2000 /&gt;

The [[Sultan of Brunei]] and Yang de Pertuan have the authority to specify any other issues that need to be addressed by BIA.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

==Functions==
The agency's principal tasks are to control and manage Brunei's general reserve funds and the growth of external holdings. It manages the country's income from oil exports in the form of foreign reserves.

{{Wiktionary|clique}}
A '''clique''' (&lt;small&gt;[[Australian English|AusE]]&lt;/small&gt;, &lt;small&gt;[[Canadian English|CanE]]&lt;/small&gt;, {{IPAc-en|uk|ˈ|k|l|iː|k}} or {{IPAc-en|us|ˈ|k|l|ɪ|k}}), in the social sciences, is a group of individuals who interact with one another and share similar interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|last=Salkind|first=Neil|date=2008-01-01|title=Cliques|encyclopedia=Encyclopedia of educational psychology|publisher=Sage Publications}}&lt;/ref&gt; Interacting with cliques is part of normative social development regardless of gender, ethnicity or popularity. Although cliques are most commonly studied during [[adolescence]] and middle childhood development, they exist in all age groups. Typically, people in a clique will not have a complete open friend group, and can therefore "ban" members of the clique if they do something that is considered unacceptable, such as talking to someone generally disliked by the clique. People who are part of a clique are bonded together through shared and similar social characteristics such as race, ethnicity, economic status and physical appearance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Labrum|first1=Chris|title=Cliques: Poverty &amp; Prejudice: Gangs of All Colors|url=https://web.stanford.edu/class/e297c/poverty_prejudice/gangcolor/cliques.htm|publisher=EDGE|accessdate=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Being part of a clique is usually seen as a norm in society regardless of status. Cliques are most likely prevalent during teenage years, but are found in other age groups. Cliques may be formed among, for example, athletes, nerds, workmates, fraternities, sororities, and cheerleaders. Cohesive factors may include ethnicity, similar interest, and physical appearance. Members of a clique often isolate themselves as a group and tend to view the clique as superior to anyone outside the clique.

==Terminology==
Within the concepts of [[sociology]], cliques are a formation of two or more individuals who share bonding characteristics that allow for them to identify with one another to form a [[social network]]. Those within the group communicate and associate with one another more so than with those outside of the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tichy|first1=Noel|title=An Analysis of Clique Formation and Structure in Organizations|jstor=2392063|publisher=Sage Publications Inc.|ref=Vol. 18, No. 2 pp. 194-208}}&lt;/ref&gt; The formation of cliques can be identified within different [[social environment]]s throughout the course their lives. One person may be part of multiple cliques, each forming and functioning independently from one another. Cliques are relevant in society due to the [[social influence]] or [[peer pressure]] that results from the interactions with individuals who share a common characteristic. The outcomes associated with clique formations may be endless with varying degrees of influence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Delbert C.|title=Decision-Making Cliques in Community Power Structures: A Comparative Study of an American and English City|jstor=2773197|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; So, a formal clique, such as a professional organization, would have a different kind of influence as compared to a social clique consisting of close friends.

== Social isolation ==
In their article "Social Isolation In America", &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sociology.stanford.edu/sites/default/files/ppcv_1.pdf|title=Paolo Parigi - Department of Sociology - Stanford University|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;Paolo Parigi and Warner Henson II define [[social isolation]] as "the degree of apartness of an entity; [which] may have structural or subjective interpretations." &lt;ref&gt;Parigi Paolo, and Warner Henson II. "Social Isolation in America." Annual Review of Sociology. Annual Review of Sociology, 2014. Web. 04 Mar. 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; Social isolation may occur when cliques set themselves apart from other groups. 

A clique can also involve a high degree of social commitment to a specific group. A stronger level of commitment results in an individual having a reduced amount of interaction with other social groups. Cliquish behaviour often involves repetition in regards to activities, vernacular, preferences and manner, which can result in conflict with other cliques, creating "outsiders". Individuals can also experience social isolation within their own clique if their values and/or behaviour begin to differ from the rest of the group. 

== Members ==
Different factors affect the way cliques are established and who is included within its membership. In some cases, people are subconsciously placed in a clique by association. For example, joining a basketball team usually causes others to automatically perceive you as an "athlete". Many people may gravitate toward a clique subconsciously through the way they are perceived or whom they may be associated with. 

Sharing similar interests is the most common way cliques are formed. As people interact with each other doing the simple things that they enjoy doing, they may find themselves drifting towards or becoming attracted to others that share the same passion. This usually causes one to gain confidence by being surrounded by people who share similar interests and it may cause an individual to feel more socially accepted.

Ethnicity usually plays a role according to setting or time frame. In today's society race still is prevalent, and therefore, cliques solely based on race have been formed. One memorable example of such a clique could be the [[Ku Klux Klan]], a notorious white supremacy group.

Members of cliques often create their own distinct dress code and communicate with one another in a unique manner. As a result, this makes a clique unique and gives each member a reassuring feeling that they belong to that specific group. As these cliques come together it isn't hard to distinguish one from the other.  For example, Deadheads, the followers of the band The Grateful Dead, identify one another with various forms of tie-dyed clothing.

Interactions among members of a clique can also lead to organized social events, such as parties, significant dates, or private meetings. Clique members have a strong commitment to their respected group. In regards to this, being present at social events is seen as mandatory. Considering this, it shows the firmness of cliques and how people ultimately conform to these specific groups.

Tina Abbott, in her book "Social and Personality Development" goes into detail about how these members conform to their specific group. "Conformity to peer groups is a prerequisite to achieving independence and autonomy as an adult.... As the young person struggles to become independent from their parents, they use the security provided by the peer group and the self-confidence that comes with it, to take the final step towards independence".&lt;ref&gt;Abbott, Tina. "Do Peers Influence Conformity?" ''Social and Personality Development''. Hove, East Sussex: Routledge, 2001. 94. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Homophily ==
'''[[Homophily]]''' is a term used to describe the way people tend to link up with others due to the fact that they share similar characteristics. The existence of homophily is also very prevalent in today's society. This concept can be seen as a possible main cause for clique formation.

On the subject of homophily, people come together and link up for many different reasons. The most typical reason is, simply, people who are close in location easily bond with each other. Also, people that meet through family, workplace, and any activities that place people in contact with others, often form personal relationships.

In some cases, the impact of homophily can be seen when people in cliques get married.

== Network formation ==
This involves meeting new people to form relationships and work together to gain better opportunity. Some people find that being associated with a clique is a way to find or gain a better chance at success. For example, many join a sorority or fraternity to gain an advantage at getting a job because they may be hired by someone who may be affiliated. Cliques go hand in hand in the way people network and are especially prevalent for those looking for jobs. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berman|first=Evan M.|date=17 December 2002|title=Workplace Relations: Friendship Patterns and Consequences (According to Managers)|url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/0033-3352.00172/abstract|journal=Public Administration Review|volume=62|pages=217–230|via=ASPA|doi=10.1111/0033-3352.00172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organization==
Every clique has some form of organization that makes up the network of social interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Peay|first1=Edmund R.|title=Hierarchail Clique Structures|jstor=2786466|publisher=American Sociological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; Informal clique networks are groups that do not have a legitimate organizational structure in which they can be established and dissolved in a shorter time period. An informal clique may consist of a person's friend group or co-workers while it may also identify other more informal groups, such as criminal gangs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Krackhardt|first1=David|last2=Stern|first2=Robert N.|title=Informal Networks and Organizational Crises: An Experimental Simulation|jstor=2786835|website=stro|publisher=American Sociological Association}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, a formal clique is a group with a socially accepted organization that is [[Hierarchy|hierarchical]] in structure. A formal clique is composed of members who have identifiable roles and interactions with one another and is found in the structure of numerous professional organizations, businesses, and even family structure. [[Culture]] is a very influential factor in the organization of clique structures because the boundaries established through differences in cultural aspects are persistent, even when the membership varies from time to time. For example, the differences in language, beliefs, traditions, etc. have always created a distinct separation or boundary between groups of people even though the members of that particular group are constantly changing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QaAQAAAAQBAJ|title=Ethnic Groups and Boundaries: The Social Organization of Culture Difference|last=Barth|first=Fredrik|date=1998-03-11|publisher=Waveland Press|isbn=9781478607953|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
The formation and deformation of clique structures do not end with [[Adolescent cliques|adolescence]], even though the number of interactions with clique groups decreases and the type of groups may change. As individuals become adults, their social interpretations alter and the formation of their cliques originates from their immediate environment, rather than from common social characteristics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carstensen|first1=Laura L.|title=Social and Emotional Patterns in Adulthood: Support For Socioemotional Theory|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/pag/7/3/331/|website=APA PsycNET|publisher=US: American Psychological Association|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; A clique should not be confused with a [[crowd]] because the smaller size and specific boundaries of a group is what causes the group formation to be considered a clique. A clique can develop in a number of different ways and within environments that consist of individuals who interact on a regular basis. The [[structural cohesion]] of the clique is the constant [[face-to-face interaction]] between members that can either create or dissolve the group, depending upon the level of interaction. If face-to-face interaction is established regularaly then cohesion between individuals will form. However, if the face-to-face interaction depreciates, then the cohesive social bond between said individuals will eventually dissolve.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Friedkin|first=Noah E.|date=1984-02-01|title=Structural Cohesion and Equivalence Explanations of Social Homogeneity|url=http://smr.sagepub.com/content/12/3/235|journal=Sociological Methods &amp; Research|language=en|volume=12|issue=3|pages=235–261|doi=10.1177/0049124184012003001|issn=0049-1241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social impact==
A clique may inhibit external [[social influence]], by impacting the emotions, opinions or behaviors of group members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hochschild|first1=Arlie Russell|title=Emotion work, Feeling Rules, and Social Structure|jstor=2778583|publisher=University of Chicago Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many ways in which the perception of information between members in a clique can influence other members on a greater level than if they had received the same information from a different source. For example, receiving information from a close friend or family member is interpreted and responded to in a different way compared to receiving the same information from someone who is not within the clique structure. The satisfaction, interaction, and closeness between the clique groups that we involve ourselves in develops and changes throughout the years. Yet, there is always a constant morphing of both the individual and the group as time goes on.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Carstensen|first1=Laura L.|title=Social and Emotional Patterns in Adulthood: Support For Socioemotional Theory|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/pag/7/3/331/|website=APA PsycNET|publisher=US: American Psychological Association|accessdate=30 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They carry their coracles and their fish home on their backs. (1972)]] 
The '''coracle''' is a small, rounded,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia |year=2012 |title=Definition of coracle |encyclopedia=Collins English Dictionary |url=http://www.dictionary.com/browse/coracle }}&lt;/ref&gt; lightweight boat of the sort traditionally used in [[Wales]], and also in parts of the [[West Country]] and in Ireland, particularly the [[River Boyne]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Evans |first=E. Estyn|title=Irish Folk Ways |publisher=Courier Dover Publications|year=2000|pages=233|isbn=978-0-486-41440-9|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HjDPRIC6QhwC&amp;pg=PA233&amp;dq=boyne+coracle&amp;lr=&amp;as_drrb_is=q&amp;as_minm_is=0&amp;as_miny_is=&amp;as_maxm_is=0&amp;as_maxy_is=&amp;as_brr=3#v=onepage&amp;q=boyne%20coracle&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Scotland]], particularly the [[River Spey]]. The word is also used of similar boats found in [[India]], [[Vietnam]], [[Iraq]] and [[Tibet]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/19961102033420/http://www.data-wales.co.uk/coracle1.htm The coracle, an ancient little boat]&lt;/ref&gt; The word "coracle" is an English spelling of the original [[Welsh language|Welsh]] ''cwrwgl'', cognate with [[Irish language|Irish]] and [[Scottish Gaelic]] ''[[currach]]'', and is recorded in English text as early as the sixteenth century. Other historical English spellings include ''corougle'', ''corracle'', ''curricle'' and ''coricle''.

==Structure==
[[File:Coracle Aug2002.jpg|thumb|Coracle on the [[River Severn]] near [[Ironbridge]]]]

The structure is made of a framework of split and interwoven [[willow]] rods, tied with willow bark. The outer layer was originally an animal skin such as horse or [[Cattle|bullock]] hide (corium),&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Coracle}}&lt;/ref&gt; with a thin layer of [[tar]] to waterproof it – today replaced by tarred [[Calico (textile)|calico]], [[canvas]], or [[fibreglass]]. The Vietnamese/Asian version of the coracle is made of interwoven bamboo and waterproofed by using resin and coconut oil.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | publisher = Thames &amp; Hudson | isbn = 0-500-05130-5 | last = Fagan | first = Brian M. | title = The Seventy Great Inventions of the Ancient World | year = 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Oval in shape and very similar to half a [[walnut]] shell, the coracle has a [[keel]]-less flat bottom to evenly spread the load across the structure and to reduce the required depth of water – often to only a few inches. This makes it ideal for use on rivers.

Each coracle is tailored to the local river conditions. In general there is one design per river, but this is not always the case. The [[Teifi]] coracle, for instance, is flat-bottomed, as it is designed to negotiate shallow rapids, common on the river in the summer, while the Carmarthen coracle is rounder and deeper, because it is used in tidal waters on the [[Tywi]], where there are no rapids. Teifi coracles are made from locally harvested wood – willow for the laths (body of the boat), hazel for the weave (''Y bleth'' in Welsh – the bit round the top) – while Tywi coracles have been made from sawn ash for a long time. The working boats tend to be made from fibreglass these days. Teifi coracles use no nails, relying on the interweaving of the laths for structural coherence, whilst the Carmarthen ones use copper nails and no interweaving.

They are an effective fishing vessel because, when powered by a skilled person, they hardly disturb the water or the fish, and they can be easily manoeuvred with one arm, while the other arm tends to the net; two coracles to a net. The coracle is propelled by means of a broad-bladed [[paddle]], which traditionally varies in design between different rivers. It is used in a [[Sculling#Single-oar sculling|sculling]] action, the blade describing a figure-of-eight pattern in the water. The paddle is used towards the front of the coracle, pulling the boat forward, with the paddler facing in the direction of travel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://koti.kapsi.fi/hvartial/coracle/coracle.htm|title=Plywood lath coracle - Free Boat Plans|website=koti.kapsi.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Welsh Coracle is intended to be carried on the back; Welsh saying is ''Llwyth dyn ei gorwgl'' (load of a man is his coracle).

Designed for use in swiftly flowing streams, the coracle has been in use in the British Isles for millennia, having been noted by [[Julius Caesar]]&lt;ref name="eb1911"/&gt; in his invasion of Britain in the mid first century BC, and used in [[Roman conquest of the Iberian peninsula|his military campaigns in Spain]]. Remains interpreted as a possible coracle were found in an Early [[Bronze Age]] grave at Barns Farm near [[Dalgety Bay]], and others have been described, from [[Corbridge]] and from near [[Ferriby Boats|North Ferriby]].&lt;ref&gt;Watkins, Trevor et al.

With contributions by Mrs Lin Barnetson, Miss A S Henshall, Dr Dorothy Lunt, Ms Ellen McAdam, Mrs Fiona Roe, Alan Shepherd and Dr C C McCawley&lt;/ref&gt;

Where coracle fishing is performed by two coraclers the net is stretched across the river between the two coracles.  The coraclers will paddle one handed, dragging the net in the other, and draw the net downstream. When a fish is caught, each hauls up an end of the net until the two boats are brought to touch, and the fish is then secured, using a [[Priest (tool)|priest]] (or knocker – a small block of wood) to stun the fish.

In the 1920s and 30s [[James Hornell]] visited hundreds of rivers in the British Isles to talk with remaining coracle makers and users. He documented the tradition in his book ''British Coracles and the Curraghs of Ireland'' (The Society for Nautical Research, 1938) containing drawings, diagrams and construction details gleaned from regular makers.

===Today===
Coracles are now seen regularly only in tourist areas of West Wales, and irregularly in [[Shropshire]]&lt;ref&gt;Shropshire coracles|http://www.severntales.co.uk/coracle.html&lt;/ref&gt; on the River Severn – a [[public house]] in [[Sundorne]], Shrewsbury called "The Coracle" has a pub sign featuring a man using a coracle on a river. The Welsh Rivers Teifi and [[River Tywi|Tywi]] are the most common places to find coracles in Wales. On the Teifi they are most frequently seen between [[Cenarth]], and [[Cilgerran]] and the village of [[Llechryd]].

In 1974, a Welsh coracle piloted by Bernard Thomas (~1923–2014) of Llechryd crossed the [[English Channel]] to France in {{frac|13|1|2}} hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Tivyside Advertiser|date=7 September 2014|title=Death of a river legend|url=http://www.tivysideadvertiser.co.uk/news/11457928.Death_of_a_river_legend/?ref=var_0|accessdate=5 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The journey was undertaken to demonstrate how the [[Bull Boat]]s of the [[Mandan]] Indians of [[North Dakota]] could have been copied from coracles introduced by [[Prince Madog]] in the 12th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannia.com/celtic/wales/facts/facts7.html|title=Wales on Britannia: Facts About Wales &amp; the Welsh|website=www.britannia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=John|first1=Gilbert|title='Coracle king' to hang up paddle|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/wales/south_west/7331209.stm|website=BBC News|publisher=BBC|accessdate=10 January 2015|date=5 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For many years until 1979, [[Shrewsbury]] coracle maker Fred Davies achieved some notability amongst football fans; he would sit in his coracle during [[Shrewsbury Town FC]] home matches at [[Gay Meadow]], and retrieve stray balls from the River Severn. Although Davies died in 1994, his legend is still associated with the club.&lt;ref&gt;''Gentlemen of the River'' by Phyllis Blakemore. Stenlake Publishing {{ISBN|978-1-84033-473-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The Coracle Society==
The Coracle Society is a UK-based organisation was founded in 1990 by its former president, Sir Peter Badge. The five founding aims of the Society were:
*To promote the knowledge of coracles, curraghs and allied craft, their making and use, and also their study and collection,
*To take all reasonable steps to support the continuance of fishing involving the use of coracles and to encourage the holding of coracle regattas, races and the like,
*To publish a newsletter as a means of communication between all those interested in coracles,
*To use its best endeavours to obtain supplies of materials for the construction of coracles, and
*To promote demonstrations, courses, exhibitions, discussions and lectures relating to coracles.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.coraclesociety.org.uk/sites/default/files/constitution%20july%202014_0.pdf The Coracle Society constitution] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160604143401/https://www.coraclesociety.org.uk/sites/default/files/constitution%20july%202014_0.pdf |date=4 June 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current president of the Society is Dr [[Irving Finkel]], Assistant Keeper in the Department if the Middle East at the British Museum, who is known for decoding a cuneiform tablet detailing [[Noah's Ark]] – the description of which resembles a very large coracle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/10574173/Irving-Finkel-reader-of-the-lost-Ark.html|title=Irving Finkel: reader of the lost Ark|first=Tom|last=Chivers|date=21 June 2018|publisher=|via=www.telegraph.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current Society chairperson is Jude Pilgrim, a committee member of the Heritage Lottery Fund. She recently played an instrumental part in setting up the Ironbridge Coracle Trust, formed to save the Eustace Rogers coracle hut in Ironbridge from demolition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-shropshire-33751536|title=England's 'last' coracle shed saved|date=2 August 2015|publisher=|via=www.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are many Society members across the country who demonstrate at events and/or run coracle building courses, helping meet the Society's founding aims. A list of some of this year's events can be found on the [https://www.coraclesociety.org.uk official Coracle Society website].

The Society was present at the 2005 [[Shrewsbury River Festival]], where they displayed various coracles on the [[River Severn]]. There is also an annual coracle regatta held in [[Ironbridge]] on the August Bank Holiday Monday every year. Organised by the [[Green Wood Centre]] until 2014 and the Ironbridge Coracle Trust from 2015, it is run on an informal basis whereby anyone with a coracle can take part in the event. Each year new entrants come with coracles made on the Bank Holiday weekend at the Green Wood Centre.

Members of the Society support the annual world championship coracle races in [[Shrewsbury]], which raises funds in support of [[Macmillan Cancer Support]].

In 2010, the Society celebrated its 20th anniversary with a number of events, including a morning of talks at the National Coracle Centre in Cenarth. In 2015, the Society celebrated its 25th anniversary at its founding home of [[St Fagans National History Museum]]. Events included a talk from Dr [[Irving Finkel]] about his experiences decoding the Noah tablet and making the accompanying Channel 4 documentary. The Society also supported the return of coracles and coracle regattas to Welshpool in 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.coraclesociety.org.uk/news/30-06-2015/welshpool-regatta|title=Welshpool regatta - The Coracle Society|website=www.coraclesociety.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Safety==
The design of the coracle makes it an unstable craft. Because it sits "on" the water, rather than "in" it, the vessel can easily be carried by currents and the wind. The Coracle Society has published guidelines for safely using coracles.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.coraclesociety.org.uk/sites/default/files/csg_0.pdf Coracle Society safety guidelines] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140327234217/http://www.coraclesociety.org.uk/sites/default/files/csg_0.pdf |date=27 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The oldest instructions yet found for construction of a coracle are contained in precise directions on a four-thousand-year-old [[cuneiform]] tablet supposedly dictated by the Mesopotamian god [[Enki]] to [[Atra-Hasis]] on how to build a round "ark". The tablet is about 2,250 years older than previously discovered accounts of [[flood myth]]s, none of which contain such details. These instructions depict a vessel that is today known as a [[quffa]], or Iraqi coracle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Noah's Ark Was Round, Based On 4,000-Year-Old Mesopotamian Instructions That Are 'Mathematically Accurate' |author=Gabrielle Jonas |url=http://www.isciencetimes.com/articles/6746/20140128/noahs-ark-round-mesopotamia-flood-cuneiform-instructions-mathematically-accurate.htm |newspaper=International Science Times |date=January 28, 2014 |accessdate=March 4, 2014 |quote=Four thousand-year-old cuneiform instructions on how to build a round "Noah's ark" have turned out to be mathematically on-target, the British Museum curator who translated the text told the ''International Science Times'' Monday. |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NoxqoE1E?url=http://www.isciencetimes.com/articles/6746/20140128/noahs-ark-round-mesopotamia-flood-cuneiform-instructions-mathematically-accurate.htm |archivedate=4 March 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many scholars believe that the basket that baby [[Moses]] was [[Finding of Moses|cast adrift]] in on the Nile (in [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]] 2:3) was in fact a coracle or quffa, based on the similarity of that passage to [[Neo-Assyria]]n legends depicting infants cast adrift on rivers in quffas.&lt;ref name=Potts&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons| isbn = 9781405189880| last = Potts| first = Daniel T.| title = A Companion to the Archaeology of the Ancient Near East| date = 2012-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Coracles: The surprising history of Britain’s strangest boat |url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/articles/23Fbd5ybr2CFG9BWYYZ7MZh/coracles-the-surprising-history-of-britain-s-strangest-boat |accessdate=14 June 2018 |work=BBC one |publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Irish [[curach]] (also ''currach'' or ''curragh'') is a similar, but larger, vessel still in use today. Curachs were also used in the west of Scotland:

{{quote|The ''curach'' or boat of leather and wicker may seem to moderns a very unsafe vehicle, to trust to tempestuous seas, yet our forefathers fearlessly committed themselves in these slight vehicles to the mercy of the most violent weather. They were once much in use in the [[Western Isles]] of Scotland, and are still found in Wales. The framework [in Gaelic] is called ''crannghail'', a word now used in [[Uist]] to signify a frail boat.|''[[Edward Dwelly|Dwelly]]'s [Scottish] Gaelic Dictionary''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dwelly.info/index.aspx|title=Dwelly-d - Dwelly's Classic Scottish Gaelic Dictionary|first=William Robertson, Michael Bauer, Edward|last=Dwelly|website=www.dwelly.info}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The [[Currach#Currachs in the River Spey|currachs in the River Spey]] were particularly similar to Welsh coracles. Other related craft include:

=== Indian coracle ===
'''Indian coracles''' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]:பரிசல் (parical), [[Kannada language|Kannada]]:ಹರಗೋಲು,ತೆಪ್ಪ, (Haragōlu, tep - "crab")) are commonly found on the rivers [[Kaveri]] and [[Tungabhadra]] in [[South India|Southern India]].&lt;ref name=man&gt;{{cite journal|jstor=2790095|title=165. The Coracles of South India|first=James|last=Hornell|date=21 June 2018|publisher=|journal=Man|volume=33|pages=157–160|doi=10.2307/2790095}}&lt;/ref&gt; Coracles are primitive, light, bowl-shaped boats with a frame of woven grasses, reeds, or saplings covered with hides.&lt;ref name=origins&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9026226/coracle |title=Encyclopædia Britannica - Coracle |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indian coracles are considered to have been in existence since prehistoric times,&lt;ref name=origins/&gt; and are a major tourist attraction at the [[Hogenakkal falls]] on the Kaveri river.&lt;ref name=row/&gt; Although these boats were originally designed for general transport, they have recently been used mostly for giving tourists rides.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tbeez.com/Attraction/hogenakkal Hogenakkal on TBeez.com] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609153437/http://www.tbeez.com/Attraction/hogenakkal |date=9 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Types====
The coracles found in the Hogenakkal are of two types, which differ mainly in size. The smaller ones are about 6.2 feet (1.9 metres) in diameter, and are used primarily for fishing. The larger ones, which measure up to 8.4 feet (2.6 metres) in diameter, are used for tourists.&lt;ref name=Sean/&gt;

====Design====
Indian coracles are either saucer or bowl shaped and circular, with the greatest diameter across the mouth. The circular coracles in Iraq are very similar, but they have convexly curved sides, and thus the mouth is not the widest part.&lt;ref name=man/&gt; Indian coracles are on average about 7.3 feet (2.24 metres) in diameter,&lt;ref name=Sean&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;id=uReIBYaxPw0C&amp;oi=fnd&amp;pg=PR12&amp;dq=hogenakal+&amp;ots=LLWOxYIbQ3&amp;sig=2AkQ1x861qTjHH5BzGRd3hzMZoM#PPA245,M1 |title=Boats of South Asia- by Sean McGrail el al |publisher=Books.google.com |date= |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; but can still hold eight people at a time.&lt;ref name=row&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hindu.com/mp/2007/05/12/stories/2007051251900500.htm |title=Row, row, row your boat |publisher=The Hindu |date=2007-05-12 |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other kinds of coracles usually can only hold one person.&lt;ref name=oneperson/&gt; Indian coracles, and coracles in general, are made of [[bamboo]] and take about a day to build, given all the necessary materials.&lt;ref name=Sean/&gt; The bottoms of the boats are covered in [[Hide (skin)|hides]], or sometimes with sheets of plastic, in order to make them waterproof.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=13550447 |title=Hide boats at Hogenakal on the river Kaveri, Tamil Nadu- by C Palmer et al |publisher=Cat.inist.fr |date= |accessdate=2013-01-31}}&lt;/ref&gt; In modern times, a sheet of [[LDPE]] plastic is often embedded between two layers of bamboo. Sometimes the bottom of the craft is tarred to make it waterproof. Coracles are steered and propelled using a single paddle from the front of the boat in the direction of travel, making them unique.&lt;ref name=Sean/&gt;

====Construction====
The boats are made primarily from bamboo. The first step in construction is a basic framework woven from bamboo sticks. Then the bottom is further reinforced with the addition of more bamboo sticks, making the boat's base sturdy. Once the bottom is structurally sound, the lowest points of the sides are defined by a circumferential band of three flat strips of bamboo woven into the existing lattice. The sides of the boat are then made with 20 to 30 adjacent strips of bamboo. Finally this framework is again strengthened by lightweight bamboo, making sure that the sides are not heavier than the base.&lt;ref name=Sean/&gt;

The boats had earlier been waterproofed by using hides of animals, but these days plastic sheets are used for this purpose as they are cheaper as well as easily available.&lt;ref name=Sean/&gt; The waterproofing is further enhanced by a layer of tar,&lt;ref name=Sean/&gt; a feature which is common in most contemporary coracles.&lt;ref name=oneperson&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.data-wales.co.uk/coracle1.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19961102033420/http://www.data-wales.co.uk/coracle1.htm |dead-url=yes |archive-date=1996-11-02 |title=The Coracle - a one person boat with an ancient lineage |publisher=Data-wales.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2013-01-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dandelife.com/story/22097 How to make a coracle?] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080609153444/http://dandelife.com/story/22097 |date=9 June 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iraqi coracle===
{{main|Quffa}}
'''Iraqi coracles''', called quffa or kuphar ([[Arabic]]: قفة), have been used as [[ferries]], [[lighter (barge)|lighters]], fishing vessels, and [[water taxi]]s on the [[Tigris]] and [[Euphrates]] rivers since at least the 9th century BC.&lt;ref name=Agius&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = BRILL| isbn = 9789004158634| last = Agius| first = Dionisius A.| title = Classic Ships of Islam: From Mesopotamia to the Indian Ocean| date = 2008|page=130|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RP2uHT06zYgC&amp;lpg=PA130}}&lt;/ref&gt; They share details with the myriad types of coracle used across [[Eurasia]].&lt;ref name=Hornell_1&gt;{{Cite journal| doi = 10.1038/143224c0| issn = 1476-4687| volume = 143| issue = 224| last = Hornell| first = James| title = British Coracles and Irish Curraghs: with a Note on the Quffah of Iraq| journal = Nature| accessdate = 2018-06-12| date = 1939-02-11| url = https://www.nature.com/articles/143224c0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern quffas can be up to 18 feet (5.5 m) in diameter and carry four to five tons.&lt;ref name=Badge&gt;{{Cite book| edition = UK| publisher = Gwasg Carrech Gwalch| isbn = 9781845272555| last = Badge| first = Peter| title = The Coracles of the World| date = 2009-06-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Modern quffas are of similar size and construction as their ancient counterparts, with both being made from woven bundles of reeds or basketry waterproofed with [[bitumen]].

The '''delta smelt''' (''Hypomesus transpacificus'') is an endangered&lt;ref name=UCN2006/&gt;&lt;ref name=USFWS/&gt; slender-bodied [[smelts|smelt]], about {{convert|5|to|7|cm|in|abbr=on}} long, in the family [[Osmeridae]]. [[Endemism|Endemic]] to the upper [[Sacramento-San Joaquin River Delta|Sacramento-San Joaquin Estuary]] of [[California]], it mainly inhabits the freshwater-saltwater mixing zone of the estuary, except during its [[spawn (biology)|spawning]] season, when it migrates upstream to fresh water following winter "[[first flush]]" flow events (around March to May).&lt;ref&gt;Sommer, T. et al. 2011.

San Francisco Estuary and Watershed Science: 9(2).&lt;/ref&gt; It functions as an [[indicator species]] for the overall health of the Delta's ecosystem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delta Smelt|url=http://www.biologicaldiversity.org/species/fish/Delta_smelt/|website=Center for Biological Diversity|accessdate=10 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of its one-year lifecycle and relatively low [[fecundity]], it is very susceptible to changes in the environmental conditions of its native habitat.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Moyle, PB. 2002. Inland fishes of California. University of California Press, Berkeley.&lt;/ref&gt; Efforts to protect the endangered fish from further decline have focused on limiting or modifying the large-scale pumping activities of state and federal water projects at the southern end of the estuary, thereby limiting water available to farming. However, these efforts have not prevented the species from becoming functionally extinct in the wild.&lt;ref name=Krieger/&gt;

The delta smelt is one of five currently recognized [[species]] within the [[genus]] ''[[Hypomesus]]'', which is part of the larger [[smelt (fish)|smelt]] family, Osmeridae. The genus has been subject to many revisions since it was first classified by Gill in 1863.&lt;ref name=McAllister1963 /&gt; The first major revision occurred in 1963, when the family Osmeridae was re-examined by Canadian [[ichthyologist]] [[Donald Evan McAllister]]. Expanding on Japanese researcher Hamada's earlier determination that ''H. olidus'' was not a monolithic widespread species, but rather one of three distinct species of ''Hypomesus'', McAllister assigned them new names, and further delineated what he believed were four subspecies. This was the first description of ''H. transpacificus'', named for its supposed occurrence on both sides of the [[Pacific]], and also "to the friendship of Japanese and Canadian ichthyologists." He separated these geographically isolated populations into separate subspecies: ''H. t. transpacificus'' and ''H. t. nipponensis''.&lt;ref name=McAllister1963/&gt;

Modern analysis of the genus would elevate all of McAllister's subspecies to full species status, based on fin ray counts and the number of chromatophores between their mandibles, a change which genetic analysis has supported.&lt;ref name=Ilves2008/&gt;&lt;ref name=Sweetnam1995/&gt; In fact, genetic analysis would conclude that despite their morphological similarities, ''[[Hypomesus nipponensis|H. nipponensis]]'' and ''H. transpacificus'' are actually members of different [[phylogenetic]] [[clades]].&lt;ref name=Ilves2009/&gt;

The abbreviated distribution of ''Hypomesus'' species along both the east and west sides of the Pacific Ocean suggests that their common ancestor had a range that would have crossed the Pacific. Researchers have hypothesized that climatic changes may have reduced the range of the ancestral species during cooling periods, which would have created a reproductive barrier, allowing [[speciation]] to occur.&lt;ref name=Ilves2008/&gt; Although the low number of species in the genus and high levels of [[homoplasy]] have frustrated attempts to determine whether the northern Pacific ''H. olidus'' or ''H. nipponensis'' are the basal species of ''Hypomesus'',&lt;ref name=Ilves2008/&gt; the most recent speciation event in ''Hypomesus'' is known to have been between the two native east Pacific species, ''H. pretiosus'' and ''H. transpacificus''. This is plausibly due to a geographic isolation of a widespread eastern Pacific ancestor, of which some members were isolated in a freshwater basin in western California, possibly in the lakes that would have been located in the southern [[San Joaquin Valley]] during the [[Pleistocene]] [[Epoch (geology)|epoch]].&lt;ref name=Ilves2008/&gt;

== Habitat ==
The delta smelt is endemic to the Sacramento–San Joaquin River Delta in California, where it is distributed from the [[Suisun Bay]] upstream through the delta in Contra Costa, Sacramento, San Joaquin, and Solano Counties.  The delta smelt is a [[pelagic]] (lives in the open water column away from the bottom) and [[euryhaline]] species (tolerant of a wide salinity range). It has been collected from estuarine waters with salinities up to 14 parts per thousand.

Historically, delta smelt were distributed from San Pablo Bay upstream to Sacramento on the Sacramento River and Mossdale on the San Joaquin River, which varied seasonally and with freshwater outflow.&lt;ref&gt;Radtke, LD (1966) Distribution of smelt, juvenile sturgeon and starry flounder in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta. In: Fish bulletin. California Department of Fish and Game, Sacramento, pp 115–129&lt;/ref&gt; Today, large areas of historic delta smelt habitat and designated critical habitat have become unsuitable for some life history stages of the species, though key environmental characteristics (e.g. temperature, salinity, water depth) of these areas have not changed.&lt;ref&gt;CDFG (2003) Comment letter on the five-year status review of the delta smelt. California Department of Fish and Game, California, p 6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Miller J, Swanson C, Poole KS (2006) Emergency petition to list the delta smelt (''Hypomesus transpacificus'') as an endangered species under the Endangered Species Act. Center for Biological Diversity, Bay Institute, &amp; Natural Resources Defense Council.&lt;/ref&gt; Delta smelt disappeared from the southern portion of their historic habitat in the late 1970s, which coincides with substantial increases in the amounts of water exported from the delta. Water export operations likely have a great effect on the distribution, abundance, and genetic diversity of delta smelt.&lt;ref&gt;Bennett, WA (2005) Critical assessment of the delta smelt population in the San Francisco Estuary, California. San Francisco Estuary [[Drainage basin|Watershed]] Sci 3:1–71.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lifecycle ==

The delta smelt is [[semelparous]], living one year and dying after its first spawning.  Their spawning occurs in spring in river channels and tidally influenced backwater sloughs upstream of the mixing zone where salt water meets fresh water.  The Sacramento and San Joaquin Rivers then transport the delta smelt larvae downstream to the mixing zone, normally located in the Suisun Bay.  Young delta smelt then feed and grow in the mixing zone before starting their upstream spawning migration in late fall or early winter.

The delta smelt is preyed upon by larger fish, especially [[striped bass]] and [[largemouth bass]], which are [[introduced species]] in the Sacramento-San Joaquin Delta.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Endangered status ==
Historically, delta smelt were relatively abundant in the upper Sacramento-San Joaquin Estuary, with populations declining dramatically in the 1980s.&lt;ref&gt;Newman KB (2008) Sample design-based methodology for estimating delta smelt abundance. San Francisco Estuary Watershed Sci 6:1–18.&lt;/ref&gt; They were listed as threatened by both federal and state governments in 1993, and sustained record-low abundance indices, prompted their listing as endangered under the California Endangered Species Act in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;CDFG (2010) State &amp; federally listed endangered &amp; threatened animals of California. California Department of Fish &amp; Game,State of California, The Natural Resources Agency, California.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;''Federal Register'' [http://ecos.fws.gov/docs/frdocs/1993/93-5085.pdf 58:12863]; March 5, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; Critical habitat was listed for delta smelt on December 19, 1994.&lt;ref&gt;''Federal Register'' [http://ecos.fws.gov/docs/frdocs/1994/94-31063.pdf 59:65256]&lt;/ref&gt;

Delta smelt are threatened with extinction due to anthropogenic alterations to their ecosystem, including urbanization, non-native species, water diversions, contaminants, and the conversion of complex tidal habitats to leveed channels.&lt;ref&gt;Nichols FH, Cloern JE, Luoma SN, Peterson DH (1986) The modification of an estuary. Science 231:567–573.&lt;/ref&gt; A survey in April 2015 found only one individual delta smelt. Although the fish is almost extinct in the wild,  extant populations remain in a captive-breeding program at [[UC Davis]] and in a fish hatchery operated by the [[U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service]] near [[Shasta Dam]].&lt;ref name=Krieger&gt;{{cite news|last1=Krieger|first1=Lisa M.|title=California drought: Delta smelt survey finds a single fish, heightening debate over water supply|url=http://www.mercurynews.com/drought/ci_27918392/california-drought-delta-smelt-survey-tallies-one-fish|accessdate=9 May 2015|agency=[[San Jose Mercury News]]|date=15 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Court protection==
In 2005, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (FWS) issued a biological opinion that the [[Central Valley Project]] and the [[California State Water Project]] were not having an adverse effect on the recovery of the delta smelt.&lt;ref&gt;http://earthjustice.org/news/press/2007/federal-judge-throws-out-biological-opinion-for-threatened-delta-smelt&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[Natural Resources Defense Council]] sued, and in 2007, Fresno U.S. District Court Judge [[Oliver Wanger]] found the biological opinion  was [[arbitrary and capricious]] and ordered protections for the delta smelt while the document was redone.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?case=10070309660459606655&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=2006 ''Natural Resources Defense Council v. Kempthorne'', 506 F. Supp. 2d 322 (E.D. Cal. 2007).]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, at the close of the court's deadline, the FWS issued a new biological opinion.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fws.gov/sfbaydelta/cvp-swp/cvp-swp.cfm&lt;/ref&gt; This time, the FWS came to the opposite of its earlier conclusion, finding the water projects were jeopardizing the continued existence of the delta smelt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jenkins|first1=Matt|title=California's Tangled Water Politics|url=https://www.hcn.org/blogs/issues/42.22/californias-tangled-water-politics?b_start:int=2#body|accessdate=22 May 2015|work=[[High Country News]]|issue=42.22|date=10 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When six new plaintiffs sued, Judge Wanger preliminarily ordered the FWS to give him weekly justifications of delta flow restrictions and appointed four scientists as his own expert witnesses.&lt;ref&gt;http://waterlawjournal.com/the-consolidated-delta-smelt-cases/&lt;/ref&gt;  After haranguing FWS expert witnesses as “zealots”,&lt;ref&gt;http://capitolweekly.net/judges-comments-in-delta-smelt-case-raised-eyebrows/&lt;/ref&gt; in December 2010 Judge Wanger, again, found the FWS BioOp was arbitrary and capricious and, again, ordered the FWS to complete a new one.&lt;ref&gt;[https://cases.justia.com/federal/district-courts/california/caedce/1:2009cv00407/188959/757/0.pdf?ts=1294108833 ''San Luis &amp; Delta-Mendota Water Auth. v. Salazar'', 760 F. Supp. 2d 855, 863 (E.D. Cal. 2010).]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, a divided panel of the [[Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals]] reversed Judge Wanger.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.pacificlegal.org/releases/10-1-14-Stewart-and-Jasper-1-1347 citing [http://www.fws.gov/sfbaydelta/documents/APPELLATE-315077-v1-Delta_smelt_II_--_panel_decision.pdf ''San Luis &amp; Delta-Mendota Water Authority v. Jewell'', 747 F.3d 581 (9th Cir. 2014)].&lt;/ref&gt;  While the new biological opinion  was “a ponderous, chaotic document, overwhelming in size”, it was found not arbitrary and capricious.&lt;ref&gt;Id., see oral argument video at [https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=MKDQTJIdioc].&lt;/ref&gt;  The Ninth Circuit affirmed that the water projects were jeopardizing the existence of the delta smelt, and given ''[[TVA v. Hill]]'''s command that endangered species must be saved "whatever the cost", Circuit Judge [[Jay Bybee]] opined that California could only use the smelts' water after receiving an exemption from the [[Endangered Species Act Amendments of 1978#The amendment of 1978 and the .22God Squad.22|God Squad]].&lt;ref&gt;''San Luis &amp; Delta-Mendota Water Authority v. Jewell'', 747 F.3d 581 (9th Cir. 2014) citing [http://lawdigitalcommons.bc.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1700&amp;context=ealr Eric M. Yuknis, Note, ''Would a “God Squad” Exemption under the Endangered Species Act Solve the California Water Crisis?'', 38 B.C. Envtl. Aff. L. Rev. 567 (2011)].&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2015 the U.S. Supreme Court declined review without comment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.scotusblog.com/case-files/cases/state-water-contractors-v-jewell/&lt;/ref&gt;

The smelt is unpopular among farmers, with a common complaint being that 200,000 acres of farmland have been left fallow due to "four buckets of minnows".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Cooke|first1=Charles C. W.|title=Green Drought, For the sake of the smelt, California farmland lies fallow|url=http://www.nationalreview.com/article/369490/green-drought-charles-c-w-cooke|accessdate=22 May 2015|work=The National Review|date=27 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although allegations have been made that this protection has hurt California's agricultural sector, with the devastation of hundreds of thousands of acres of farmland and the loss of tens of thousands of jobs in the [[Central Valley (California)|Central Valley]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://abclocal.go.com/kfsn/story?section=news/local&amp;id=6734504 ABC KFSN-TV "Water Shortage in the Central Valley"]&lt;/ref&gt; a 2009 [[UC Davis]] study estimated that job losses due to smelt protection were closer to 5,000.&lt;ref name=Josue2009&gt;Howitt, R., Josue Medellin-Azuara, Duncan MacEwan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8876">'''Digital economy''' refers to an economy that is based on digital computing technologies, although we increasingly perceive this as conducting business through markets based on the [[internet]] and the [[World Wide Web]]. The digital economy is also sometimes called the ''Internet Economy'', ''[[New Economy]]'', or ''Web Economy''. Increasingly, the digital economy is intertwined with the traditional economy, making a clear delineation harder.

== Definition ==
The term 'Digital Economy' was first mentioned in Japan by a Japanese professor and research economist in the midst of Japan's recession of the 1990s. In the west the term followed and was coined in [[Don Tapscott]]'s 1995 book ''The Digital Economy: Promise and Peril in the Age of Networked Intelligence''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Tapscott|first=Don|title=The digital economy : promise and peril in the age of networked intelligence|year=1997|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York|isbn=0-07-063342-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was among the first books to consider how the Internet would change the way we did business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Don Tapscott Biography|url=http://www.allgame.com/person.php?id=2436|accessdate=24 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Thomas Mesenbourg]] (2001),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Mesenbourg |first=T.L. |title= Measuring the Digital Economy |year=2001 |publisher= U.S. Bureau of the Census}}&lt;/ref&gt; three main components of the 'Digital Economy' concept can be identified:
*e-business infrastructure (hardware, software, telecoms, networks, human capital, etc.),
*e-business (how business is conducted, any process that an organization conducts over computer-mediated networks),
*e-commerce (transfer of goods, for example when a book is sold online).

But, as Bill Imlah&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Concept of a "Digital Economy" |url= http://odec.org.uk/the-concept-of-a-digital-economy/ |accessdate= 30 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; comments, new applications are blurring these boundaries and adding complexity; for example, consider [[social media]] and Internet search.

: ''In the last decade of the 20th century.  [[Nicholas Negroponte]] (1995) used a metaphor of shifting from processing atoms to processing bits. "The problem is simple. When information is embodied in atoms, there is a need for all sorts of industrial-age means and huge corporations for delivery. But suddenly, when the focus shifts to bits, the traditional big guys are no longer needed. Do-it-yourself publishing on the Internet makes sense. It does not for a paper copy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= Nicholas Negroponte |date= 1995-01-01 |title=Bits and Atoms |work= Wired magazine |id= ([http://web.media.mit.edu/~nicholas/Wired/WIRED3-01.html MIT link]) |url= https://www.wired.com/1995/01/negroponte-30/ |accessdate= 20 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In this new economy, digital networking and communication infrastructures provide a global platform over which people and organizations devise strategies, interact, communicate, collaborate and search for information.
More recently,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite arXiv |title= Merchant Sharing |eprint= 1405.2051 |last1= Fournier |first1= Laurent |class=q-fin.EC |year=2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Digital Economy'' has been defined as the branch of economics studying '''zero marginal cost intangible goods''' over the Net.

==Impact==
'''The Digital Economy''' is worth three trillion dollars today. This is about 30% of the S&amp;P 500, six times the U.S.’ annual trade deficit or more than the GDP of the United Kingdom.  What is impressive is the fact that this entire value has been generated in the past 20 years since the launch of the Internet.

It is widely accepted that the growth of the digital economy has widespread impact on the whole economy. Various attempts at categorizing the size of the impact on traditional sectors have been made.&lt;ref name="myclouddoor1"&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20140706101452/http://www.myclouddoor.com/web/documents/The%20New%20Digital%20Economy.pdf The New Digital Economy - How it will transform business], [[Oxford Economics]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telstra1"&gt;[http://telstra.com.au/business-enterprise/download/document/business-telstra-deloitte-digital-taking-leadership-in-a-digtal-economy.pdf Taking leadership in a digital economy], [[Deloitte Digital]] &amp; [[Telstra]]&lt;/ref&gt;

Telstra, a leading Australian telecommunications provider, describes how competition will become more global and more intense as a result of the digital economy.&lt;ref name="telstra1"/&gt;

==Response==
Given its expected broad impact, traditional firms are actively assessing how to respond to the changes brought about by the digital economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mckinsey.com/insights/mgi/research/technology_and_innovation/essays_in_digital_transformation Internet matters: Essays in digital transformation | McKinsey &amp; Company].

Feminist empiricism proposes that feminist theories can be objectively proven through evidence. {{tone-inline|date=February 2018}}{{why|date=February 2018}} Feminist empiricism critiques what it perceives to be inadequacies and biases within mainstream research methods, including positivism.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1994 90" /&gt;

Feminist empiricism is one of three main feminist [[Epistemology|epistemological]] perspectives. The other two are [[standpoint feminism]] and [[Post-structural feminism|post-structural/postmodern feminism]].&lt;ref name="Hansen 2010 25"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=VWAKBAAAQBAJ|page=25}}|title=Gender Matters in Global Politics: A Feminist Introduction to International Relations|last=Hansen|first=L.|last3=|date=17 July 2014|publisher=Routledge|year=|isbn=978-1-134-75252-2|editor-last=Shepherd|editor-first=Laura J.|location=|pages=25|chapter=Ontologies, Epistemologies, Methodologies}}&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;
{{Feminism sidebar}}
== Example ==
In [[international relations]] rationalist feminism{{Clarify|reason=What is "rational feminism"?|date=May 2018}} employs feminist empiricism to explain the political landscape. Rationalist feminism examines state, transnational and institutional actors, and specifically looks at causal relationships between these actors and gender issues. [[Quantitative data]] is used to relate gender to these phenomena. This may be done by directly correlating gender data to specific state behaviors, or indirectly by examining a "gender gap" through indirect causal relationships.&lt;ref name="Hansen 2010 25" /&gt; Popular perspectives linked to rationalist feminism within international relations include conventional [[Constructivism (international relations)|constructivism]] and [[Peace and conflict studies|quantitative peace research]].&lt;ref name="Hansen 2010 25" /&gt;

== Critiques ==

===Standpoint feminism===
Among other criticisms, standpoint feminism argues that feminist empiricism cannot explain the way the political world works because the foundations on which it is built are based on the same gendered assumptions that all mainstream scientific inquiries face.&lt;ref name="Campbell 1994 90" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Harding1986"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=27TrCuk4LRgC|title=The Science Question in Feminism|author=Harding|first=Sandra G.|publisher=Cornell University Press|year=1986|isbn=0-8014-9363-3|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist empiricism argues that its epistemological outlook, lets it tackle this gender bias.&lt;ref name="Caprioli 2004 254"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Caprioli|first=M|title=Feminist IR Theory and Quantitative Methodology: A Critical Analysis|journal=International Studies Review|year=2004|volume=6|issue=2|page=254|jstor=3699593|doi=10.1111/j.1521-9488.2004.00398.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Post-modern feminism===
[[Post-modern|Post-structural/post-modern]] [[feminist]] [[epistemology]] is entirely discursive, seeking to develop understanding through social analysis; to interpret rather than explain feminist theories in the political world. 

Feminist empiricism is more likely to favor [[qualitative data]]. Objective measurements are seen as important to eliminating the [[gender bias]] that exists.&lt;ref name="Hawkesworth 2006 57" /&gt; Post-structuralism is inherently opposed to the idea of an [[objective truth]] in the [[social sciences]]. The belief is that those who study within the human sciences are ensnared by the same structures that affect the society in which they study.&lt;ref name="Buckler 2010 170"&gt;Buckler, S. (2010). Normative Theory. In D. Marsh, &amp; G. Stoker (Eds.), ''Theory and Methods in Political Science'' (p. 170). New York: Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt; Post-structural feminism critiques the belief that any viewpoint is impartial; knowledge is not found but constructed.&lt;ref name="Hawkesworth 2006 57"&gt;{{cite book|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=xRG7fDwewQIC}}|title=Feminist Inquiry: From Political Conviction to Methodological Innovation|last=Hawkesworth|first=M.

E.|location=|pages=|chapter=Grappling with Claims of Truth}}&lt;nowiki&gt;}}&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; A specific result of this disagreement is the way in which the two theories view gender: feminist empiricism claims that gender variables are based on biological sex, while post-structural/post-modern feminism sees gender as a socially constituted entity.&lt;ref name="Hansen 2010 25" /&gt;

The '''Fuzhou dialect''', ({{zh|t=福州話|s=福州话|p=Fúzhōuhuà}}; [[Foochow Romanized|FR]]: {{Audio|Cdo fuzhou dialect.ogg|''Hók-ciŭ-uâ''}}) also '''Fuzhounese''', '''Foochow''' or '''Hok-chiu''', is the prestige variety of the [[Eastern Min]] branch of [[Min Chinese]] spoken mainly in the Mindong region of eastern [[Fujian]] province. Like many other [[varieties of Chinese]], the Fuzhou dialect is dominated by monosyllabic morphemes which carry lexical [[Tone (linguistics)|tones]],&lt;ref name=WALS_fuz&gt;{{cite web|title=WALS Online - Language Fuzhou|url=http://wals.info/languoid/lect/wals_code_fuz|website=World Atlas of Language Structures|accessdate=9 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has a mainly [[analytic language|analytic syntax]]. While the [[Eastern Min]] branch that it belongs to is closer to [[Southern Min]] than to other Sinitic branches such as [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] or [[Hakka Chinese|Hakka]], they are still not mutually intelligible.

Centered in [[Fuzhou City]], the Fuzhou dialect covers eleven cities and counties: [[Fuzhou]] City Proper, [[Pingnan County, Fujian|Pingnan]], [[Gutian County|Gutian]], [[Luoyuan County|Luoyuan]], [[Minqing County|Minqing]], [[Lianjiang County|Lianjiang]] (including [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]]), [[Minhou County|Minhou]], [[Changle]], [[Yongtai County|Yongtai]], [[Fuqing]] and [[Pingtan County|Pingtan]]. It is also the second local language in many northern and middle Fujian cities and counties such as [[Nanping]], [[Shaowu]], [[Shunchang County|Shunchang]], [[Sanming]] and [[Youxi County|Youxi]].&lt;ref&gt;陈泽平. (1998). 福州方言研究: 福建人民出版社, 福州.&lt;/ref&gt;

Fuzhou dialect is also widely spoken in some regions abroad, especially in [[Southeastern Asia]]n countries like Malaysia and Indonesia. The city of [[Sibu]] in Malaysia is called "New Fuzhou" due to the influx of immigrants there in the late 19th century and early 1900s. Similarly, quite a significant number of Fuzhounese have emigrated to Singapore, Taiwan, United States, Canada, United Kingdom, Australia and New Zealand in the decades since China's economic reform.

==Name==
In older works, the variety is called "Foochow dialect", based on the [[Chinese postal romanization]] of Fuzhou.
In Chinese, it is sometimes called {{lang|zh-tw|福州語}} ({{lang|cdo|Hók-ciŭ-ngṳ̄}}; [[pinyin]]: ''Fúzhōuyǔ''). Native speakers also refer to it as '''Bàng-uâ''' ({{lang|zh-tw|平話}}), meaning "the everyday language."

In [[Singapore]] and [[Malaysia]], it is often referred to as "Hokchiu" ({{IPA-nan|hɔk̚˥t͡ɕiu˦|}}), which is the pronunciation of [[Fuzhou]] in the [[Southern Min]] [[Hokkien]] language, or "Huchiu" ({{IPA-nan|hu˨˩t͡ɕiu˥|}}), which is the pronunciation of [[Fuzhou]] in the [[Eastern Min]] language of Fuzhou itself. Eastern Min and Southern Min are both spoken in the same [[Fujian]] province, but the name Hokkien, while etymologically derived from the same characters as Fujian (福建), is used in Southeast Asia and the English press to refer specifically to Southern Min, which has a larger number of speakers both within Fujian and in the Chinese diaspora of Southeast Asia.

==History==

===Formation===
[[File:Qilinbayin.jpg|left|thumb|The authoritative Foochow rime book ''[[Qī Lín Bāyīn]]'']]
After the [[Qin Dynasty]] conquered the [[Minyue]] kingdom of southeast China in 110 BC, [[Han Chinese]] people began settling what is now [[Fujian]] province. 
The [[Old Chinese]] language brought by the mass influx of Han immigrants from Northern area, along with the influences of local languages, became the early Proto-Min language from which Eastern Min, Southern Min, and other Min languages arose.&lt;ref&gt;Li Rulong, Liang Yuzhang: Fuzhou Dialect Records, 2001, {{ISBN|7-80597-361-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Within this Min branch of Chinese, Eastern Min and Southern Min both form part of a Coastal Min subgroup, and are thus closer to each other than to Inland Min groups such as [[Northern Min]] and [[Central Min]].

The famous book ''[[Qī Lín Bāyīn]]'', which was compiled in the 17th century, is the first and the most full-scale [[rime book]] that provides a systematic guide to character reading for people speaking or learning the Fuzhou dialect. It once served to standardize the language and is still widely quoted as an authoritative reference book in modern academic research in Min Chinese phonology.

===Studies by Western missionaries===
[[File:Dictionary of foochow h.jpg|left|thumb|''[[:s:Dictionary of the Foochow dialect|Dictionary of the Foochow dialect]]'', 3rd Edition, published in 1929]]
In 1842, [[Fuzhou]] was open to Westerners as a [[treaty port]] after the signing of the [[Treaty of Nanjing]]. But due to the language barrier, however, the first Christian missionary base in this city did not take place without difficulties. In order to convert Fuzhou people, those missionaries found it very necessary to make a careful study of the Fuzhou dialect. Their most notable works are listed below:&lt;ref&gt;Li, Zhuqing: A study of the "Qī Lín Bāyīn", [[University of Washington]], 1993&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies by Japanese scholars===
[[File:Japo-foochow2.jpg|left|thumb|''Japanese-Chinese Translation: Fuzhou Dialect'', published in [[Taipei]], 1940. [[Foochow kana]] is used to represent Foochow pronunciation.]]

During the [[Second World War]], some Japanese scholars became passionate about studying Fuzhou dialect, believing that it could be beneficial to the rule of the [[Greater East Asia Co-Prosperity Sphere]]. One of their most famous works was the ''Japanese-Chinese Translation: Fuzhou Dialect'' ({{lang|ja|日華對譯: 福州語}}) published in 1940 in [[Taipei]], in which [[katakana]] was used to represent Fuzhou pronunciation.

===Status quo===
[[File:Foochow teaching.jpg|thumb|Pupils in Gulou Experimental Elementary School ({{lang|zh-tw|鼓樓實驗小學}}) in Fuzhou are learning the Foochow [[nursery rhyme]] ''Cĭng-cēu-giāng'' ({{lang|zh-tw|真鳥囝}})]]
By the end of the [[Qing Dynasty]], Fuzhou society had been largely [[Multilingualism#Multilingualism at the societal level|monolingual]]. But for decades the Chinese government has discouraged the use of the vernacular in school education and in media, so the number of [[Mandarin Chinese|Mandarin]] speakers has been greatly boosted. Recent reports indicate that less than 50% of young people in Fuzhou are able to speak Fuzhou dialect.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.fznews.com.cn/fuzhou/2006-10-19/20061019+6Qa5T+h2223174.shtml Survey by Fuzhou Evening Paper Showing Less Than Half of Fuzhou Youth Able to Speak Fuzhou Dialect] {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Mainland China]], the Fuzhou dialect has been officially listed as an [[Intangible Cultural Heritage]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2008-06/11/content_8346274.htm Fuzhou Dialect Protected as Intangible Cultural Heritage] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110807080056/http://news.xinhuanet.com/newscenter/2008-06/11/content_8346274.htm |date=2011-08-07 }} {{zh icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; and promotion work is being systematically carried out to preserve its use. In [[Matsu Islands|Matsu]], currently controlled by the [[Republic of China]] located in [[Taiwan]], the teaching of Fuzhou dialect has been successfully introduced into [[elementary schools]].

==Phonology==

{{IPA notice}}
{{SpecialChars}}
Like all Chinese varieties, the Fuzhou dialect is a [[tonal language]], and has extensive [[sandhi]] rules in the [[Syllable onset|initials]], [[Syllable rime|rimes]], and [[tone (linguistics)|tones]]. These complicated rules make Fuzhou dialect one of the most difficult Chinese varieties.&lt;ref&gt;Yuan Jiahua: Summary of Chinese Dialects, 2nd Edition, 2003, {{ISBN|978-7-80126-474-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tones===
There are seven original [[tone (linguistics)|tones]] in Fuzhou dialect, compared with the eight tones of [[Middle Chinese]]:

The sample characters are taken from the ''[[Qī Lín Bāyīn]]''.

In ''Qī Lín Bāyīn'', the Fuzhou dialect is described as having eight tones, which explains how the book got its title (''Bāyīn'' means "eight tones"). That name, however, is somewhat misleading, because Ĭng-siōng ({{lang|zh-tw|陰上}}) and Iòng-siōng ({{lang|zh-tw|陽上}}) are identical in [[tone contour]]; therefore, only seven tones exist.

Ĭng-ĭk and Iòng-ĭk (or so-called [[checked tone|entering tone]]) syllables end with either [[Voiceless velar plosive|velar stop]] {{IPA|[k]}} or a [[glottal stop]] {{IPA|[ʔ]}}. However, they are both now realized as a glottal stop, though the two [[phoneme]]s maintain distinct sandhi behavior in connected speech.

Besides those seven tones listed above, two new tonal values, "˨˩" (Buáng-ĭng-ké̤ṳ, {{lang|zh-tw|半陰去}}) and {{IPA|˧˥}} (Buáng-iòng-ké̤ṳ, {{lang|zh-tw|半陽去}}) occur in connected speech (see '''Tonal sandhi''' below).

==== Tonal sandhi ====
The rules of [[tonal sandhi]] in Fuzhou dialect are complicated, even compared with those of other Min dialects. When two or more than two morphemes combine into a word, the tonal value of the last morpheme remains stable but in most cases those of the preceding morphemes change. For example, "{{lang|zh-tw|獨}}", "{{lang|zh-tw|立}}" and "{{lang|zh-tw|日}}" are words of Iòng-ĭk ({{lang|zh-tw|陽入}}) with the same tonal value {{IPA|˥}}, and are pronounced {{IPA|[tuʔ˥]}}, {{IPA|[liʔ˥]}}, and {{IPA|[niʔ˥]}}, respectively. When combined together as the phrase "{{lang|zh-tw|獨立日}}" (Independence Day), "{{lang|zh-tw|獨}}" changes its tonal value to {{IPA|˨˩}}, and "{{lang|zh-tw|立}}" changes its to {{IPA|˧}}, therefore the pronunciation as a whole is {{IPA|[tuʔ˨˩ liʔ˧ niʔ˥]}}.

The two-syllable tonal sandhi rules are shown in the table below (the rows give the first syllable's original citation tone, while the columns give the citation tone of the second syllable):

Ĭng-ĭk-gák ({{lang|zh-tw|陰入甲}}) are Ĭng-ĭk ({{lang|zh-tw|陰入}}) syllables ending with {{IPA|/k/}} and Ĭng-ĭk-ék ({{lang|zh-tw|陰入乙}}) are those with {{IPA|/ʔ/}}.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.yam.com/gnudoyng/article/5806871 Nguāi Muōng Gōng Nṳ̄ Muōng Tiăng (我罔講汝罔聽), post of March 17th, 2006], retrieved December 26th, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Both are usually realized as the [[glottal stop]] by most modern speakers of the Fuzhou dialect, but they are distinguished both in the above tone sandhi behavior, and in [[Fuzhou dialect#Initial assimilation|initial assimilation]] that occurs after them.

The three patterns of tone sandhi exhibited in the Fuzhou dialect may be a reflex of the voicing split from [[Middle Chinese]] into different registers. This is based on a comparison with the tonal sandhi system of the subdialect of [[Lianjiang County|Lianjiang]], a very similar but more conservative [[Eastern Min]] variety, where three tonal categories on the penultimate syllables  ("Yin" / Ĭng / {{lang|zh-tw|陰}} from unvoiced consonants in Middle Chinese; "Yang" / Iòng / {{lang|zh-tw|陽}} from voiced consonants in Middle Chinese; and a third "Shang" / Siōng / {{lang|zh-tw|上}} tonal category from the Middle Chinese "rising tone" 上聲 where the Yin and Yang registers have merged) interact with the tonal category of the final syllable to form the sandhi pattern in Lianjiang.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J., &amp; Chen, Y. (2012). The Effect of Historical Tone Categories on Tone Sandhi in Lianjiang. Paper presented at the 20th Annual Conference of the IACL, Hongkong.https://www.researchgate.net/publication/271849974_The_Effect_of_Historical_Tone_Categories_on_Tone_Sandhi_in_Lianjiang&lt;/ref&gt;Although the effect of the historical tonal registers from Middle Chinese is clear in Lianjiang, the Fuzhou tonal sandhi system has deviated from the older pattern, in that the tone Iòng-ké̤ṳ 陽去{{IPA|˨˦˨}}, which is from the historical "Yang" tonal register, now follows the sandhi rules for the "Yin" register; and the sandhi tone Ĭng-ĭk-gák 陰入乙 {{IPA|˨˦}}, which comes from the historical "Yin" register, follow the sandhi rules for the merged "Shang" tone.&lt;ref&gt;Wu, J., &amp; Chen, Y. (2012). An account of Lianjiang tone Sandhi: Pitch target, context, and historical tone categories. Paper presented at the Tone and Intonation Conference 2012 (TIE5), Londen.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The tonal sandhi rules of more than two syllables display further complexities:

For four-syllable words, they can be treated as two sequential two-syllable units, and undergo two-syllable tone sandhi accordingly; in faster speech, the first two syllables are reduced to a half dark departing tone, and the remaining two syllables undergo two-syllable tone sandhi.

===Initials===
There are fifteen [[Syllable onset|initial]]s, including a zero initial realized as a glottal stop {{IPA|[ʔ]}}:

The Chinese characters in the brackets are also sample characters from ''[[Qī Lín Bāyīn]]''.

Some speakers find it difficult to distinguish between the initials {{IPA|/n/}} and {{IPA|/l/}}.

No [[Labiodental consonant|labiodental phonemes]], such as {{IPA|/f/}} or {{IPA|/v/}}, exist in Fuzhou dialect, which is one of the most conspicuous characteristics shared by all branches in the [[Min Chinese|Min Family]].

{{IPA|[β]}} and {{IPA|[ʒ]}} exist only in connected speech (see '''Initial assimilation''' below).

==== Initial assimilation ====
In Fuzhou dialect, there are various kinds of initial [[Assimilation (linguistics)|assimilation]], all of which are progressive. When two or more than two syllables combine into a word, the initial of the first syllable stays unchanged while those of the following syllables, in most cases, change to match its preceding phoneme, i.e., the [[Syllable coda|coda]] of its preceding syllable. As with the [[Fuzhou dialect#Close/Open rimes|rime changes]], initial assimilation is not as mandatory as tone sandhi in connected speech, and its presence and absence may indicate different parts of speech, different meanings of a single word, or different relationships between groups of words syntactically.&lt;ref name=Li_(2002)_6&gt;Li Zhuping: ''Fuzhou Phonology and Grammar'', Dunwoody Press (2002), page 6.&lt;/ref&gt;

As has been mentioned above, there are theoretically two different entering tonal codas in Fuzhou dialect: {{IPA|/-k/}} and {{IPA|/-ʔ/}}. But for most Fuzhou dialect speakers, those two codas are only distinguishable when in the [[#Tonal sandhi|tonal sandhi]] or [[#Initial assimilation|initial assimilation]].

==== Close/Open rimes ====
Some rimes come in pairs in the above table: the one to the left represents a close rime ({{lang|zh-tw|緊韻}}), while the other represents an open rime ({{lang|zh-tw|鬆韻}}). The close/open rimes are closely related with the tones. As single syllables, the tones of Ĭng-bìng ({{lang|zh-tw|陰平}}), Siōng-siăng ({{lang|zh-tw|上聲}}), Iòng-bìng ({{lang|zh-tw|陽平}}) and Iòng-ĭk ({{lang|zh-tw|陽入}}) have close rimes while Ĭng-ké̤ṳ ({{lang|zh-tw|陰去}}), Ĭng-ĭk ({{lang|zh-tw|陰入}}) and Iòng-ké̤ṳ ({{lang|zh-tw|陽去}}) have the open rimes. In connected speech, an open rime shifts to its close counterpart in the [[#Tonal sandhi|tonal sandhi]].

For instance, "{{lang|zh-tw|福}}" (hók) is a Ĭng-ĭk syllable and is pronounced {{IPA|[hɔuʔ˨˦]}} and "{{lang|zh-tw|州}}" (ciŭ) a Ĭng-bìng syllable with the pronunciation of {{IPA|[tsiu˥]}}. When these two syllables combine into the word "{{lang|zh-tw|福州}}" (Hók-ciŭ, Fuzhou), "{{lang|zh-tw|福}}" changes its tonal value from {{IPA|˨˦}} to {{IPA|˨˩}} and, simultaneously, shifts its rime from {{IPA|[-ɔuʔ]}} to {{IPA|[-uʔ]}}, so the phrase is pronounced {{IPA|[huʔ˨˩ tsiu˥]}}. While in the word "{{lang|zh-tw|中國}}" {{IPA|[tyŋ˥˧ kuoʔ˨˦]}} (Dṳ̆ng-guók, China), "{{lang|zh-tw|中}}" is a Ĭng-bìng syllable and therefore its close rime never changes, though it does change its tonal value from {{IPA|˥}} to {{IPA|˥˧}} in the tonal sandhi.

As with [[Fuzhou dialect#Initial assimilation|initial assimilation]], the closing of open rimes in connected speech is not as compulsory than tone sandhi. It has been described as "a sort of switch that flips on and off to indicate different things", so its presence or absence can indicate different meanings or different syntactic functions.&lt;ref name=Li_(2002)_6 /&gt;

The phenomenon of close/open rimes is nearly unique to the Fuzhou dialect and this feature makes it especially intricate and hardly intelligible even to speakers of other [[Min Chinese|Min]] varieties.

===Other phonological features===

====Neutral tone====
The [[Standard Chinese phonology#Neutral tone|neutral tone]] is attested in the Fuzhou dialect, as well as being found in the [[Southern Min]] group and in varieties of [[Mandarin Chinese]], including Beijing-based [[Standard Mandarin]]. It is commonly found in some modal particles, aspect markers, and some question-forming negative particles that come after units made up of one tone sandhi domain, and in some adverbs, aspect markers, conjunctions etc. that come before such units. These two types, the post-nucleus and the pre-nucleus neutral tone, exhibit different tone sandhi behavior. Disyllabic neutral tone words are also attested, as are some inter-nuclei neutral tones, mainly connected to the use of 蜀 ''siŏh'' /{{IPA|suoʔ˥}}/ in verbal reduplication.&lt;ref name=Li_(2002)_106&gt;Li Zhuping: ''Fuzhou Phonology and Grammar'', Dunwoody Press (2002), page 106.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Vocabulary==
Most [[words]] in Fuzhou dialect have [[cognates]] in other [[varieties of Chinese]], so a non-Fuzhou speaker would find it much easier to understand Fuzhou dialect written in [[Chinese characters]] than spoken in conversation. However, [[false friends]] do exist: for example, "{{lang|zh-tw|莫細膩}}" (mŏ̤h sá̤-nê) means "don't be too polite" or "make yourself at home", "{{lang|zh-tw|我對手汝洗碗}}" (nguāi dó̤i-chiū nṳ̄ sā̤ uāng) means "I help you wash dishes", "{{lang|zh-tw|伊共伊老媽嚟冤家}}" (ĭ gâe̤ng ĭ lâu-mā lā̤ uŏng-gă) means "he and his wife are quarreling (with each other)", etc. Mere knowledge of Mandarin vocabulary does not help one catch the meaning of these sentences.

The majority of Fuzhou dialect vocabulary dates back to more than 1,200 years ago. Some daily-used words are even preserved as they were in the [[Tang Dynasty]], which can be illustrated by a poem of a famous Chinese poet [[Gu Kuang]].&lt;ref&gt;Zhao Rihe: Fuzhou Dialect Rhyme Dictionary, 1998, MRXN-1998-0465&lt;/ref&gt; In his poem ''Jiǎn'' ({{lang|zh-tw|囝}}), [[Gu Kuang]] explicitly noted:

{{quotation|{{lang|zh-tw|囝，音蹇。閩俗呼子為囝，父為郎罷。}}&lt;br /&gt;"{{lang|zh-tw|囝}} is pronounced as {{lang|zh-tw|蹇}}. In Fujian vernacular son is called {{lang|zh-tw|囝}}, and father {{lang|zh-tw|郎罷}}."}}

In Fuzhou dialect, "{{lang|zh-tw|囝}}" (giāng) and "{{lang|zh-tw|郎罷}}" (nòng-mâ) are still in use today.

===Words from Old Chinese===

Quite a few words from [[Old Chinese]] have retained the original meanings for thousands of years, while their counterparts in [[Mandarin Chinese]] have either fallen out of daily use or varied to different meanings.

This table shows some Fuzhou dialect words from Old Chinese, as contrasted to Mandarin Chinese:

===Loan words from English===
The [[First Opium War]], also known as the First Anglo-Chinese War, was ended in 1842 with the signing of the [[Treaty of Nanjing]], which forced the [[Qing government]] to open [[Fuzhou]] to all [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland|British]] traders and missionaries. Since then, quite a number of churches and Western-style schools have been established. Consequently, some [[English language|English]] words [[Loanword|came into]] Fuzhou dialect, but without fixed written forms in Chinese characters. The most frequently used words are listed below:&lt;ref&gt;Chen Zeping: Loan Words in Fuzhou dialect, [[Fujian Normal University]], 1994&lt;/ref&gt;
* kŏk, {{IPA|[kʰouʔ˥]}}, [[noun]], meaning "an article of dress", is from the word "coat";

* pĕng-giāng, {{IPA|[pʰeiŋ˥˧ ŋjaŋ˧]}}, noun, meaning "a small sum of money", is from the word "penny";
* tă̤h, {{IPA|[tʰeʔ˥]}}, noun, meaning "money", is from the word "take";
* sò̤, {{IPA|[so˥˧]}}, [[verb]], meaning "to shoot (a basket)", is from the word "shoot";

==Writing system==

===Chinese characters===
[[File:Foochow Bible in Characters.gif|thumb|left|Foochow Bible in Chinese Characters, published by China Bible House in 1940.]]
Most of the words of Fuzhou dialect stem from [[Old Chinese]] and can therefore be written in Chinese characters. Many books published in [[Qing Dynasty]] have been written in this traditional way, such as the famous ''Mǐndū Biéjì'' ({{lang|zh-tw|閩都別記}}, Foochow Romanized: Mìng-dŭ Biék-gé). However, Chinese characters as the writing system for Fuzhou dialect do have many shortcomings.

Firstly, a great number of words are unique to Fuzhou dialect, so that they can only be written in informal ways. For instance, the word "mâ̤", a negative word, has no common form. Some write it as "{{lang|zh-tw|賣}}" or "{{lang|zh-tw|袂}}", both of which share with it an identical pronunciation but has a totally irrelevant meaning; and others prefer to use a newly created character combining "{{lang|zh|勿}}" and "{{lang|zh|會}}", but this character is not included in most fonts.

Secondly, Fuzhou dialect has been excluded from the educational system for many decades. As a result, many if not all take for granted that Fuzhou dialect does not have a formal writing system and when they have to write it, they tend to misuse characters with a similar [[Mandarin Chinese]] enunciation. For example, "{{lang|zh-tw|會使}} (â̤ sāi)", meaning "okay", are frequently written as "{{lang|zh-tw|阿塞}}" because they are uttered almost in the same way.

===Foochow Romanized===
[[File:Foochow Bible.gif|thumb|right|[[Bible]] in Foochow Romanized, published by British and Foreign Bible Society in 1908.]]
{{Main|Foochow Romanized}}
'''Foochow Romanized''', also known as '''Bàng-uâ-cê''' ({{lang|zh-tw|平話字}}, '''BUC''' for short) or '''Hók-ciŭ-uâ Lò̤-mā-cê''' ({{lang|zh-tw|福州話羅馬字}}), is a [[romanization|romanized]] [[orthography]] for Fuzhou dialect adopted in the middle of 19th century by [[United States|American]] and [[United Kingdom|English]] [[missionaries]]. It had varied at different times, and became standardized several decades later. Foochow Romanized was mainly used inside of Church circles, and was taught in some Mission Schools in [[Fuzhou]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fjsdfz.org/html/news/2004b/20041123fzwb.htm {{lang|zh-tw|福州女校三鼎甲}} {{zh icon}}]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Mǐnqiāng Kuàizì}}

'''Mǐnqiāng Kuàizì''' ({{lang|zh-tw|閩腔快字}}, Foochow Romanized: ''Mìng-kiŏng Kuái-cê''), literally meaning "Fujian Colloquial Fast Characters", is a Qieyin System ({{lang|zh-tw|切音系統}}) for Fuzhou dialect designed by Chinese scholar and calligrapher Li Jiesan ({{lang|zh-tw|力捷三}}) in 1896.

A '''generation''' is "all of the people [[Childbirth|born]] and [[Personhood|living]] at about the same time, regarded [[collective]]ly". It can also be described as, "the average [[Era|period]], generally considered to be about thirty years, during which children are born and [[Aging|grow up]], become adults, and begin to have children of their own".&lt;ref&gt;generation. Dictionary.com. ''Dictionary.com Unabridged''. Random House, Inc. &lt;nowiki&gt;http://www.dictionary.com/browse/generation&lt;/nowiki&gt; (accessed: 22 December 2016).&lt;/ref&gt; In [[kinship]] terminology, it is a structural term designating the parent-child relationship. It is also known as [[biogenesis]], [[reproduction]], or [[procreation]] in the [[biology|biological sciences]].

"Generation" is also often used synonymously with ''[[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]]'' in [[social science]]; under this formulation it means "people within a delineated population who experience the same significant events within a given period of time".&lt;ref name=Pilcher&gt;{{cite journal|last=Pilcher|first=Jane|title=Mannheim's Sociology of Generations: An undervalued legacy|journal=British Journal of Sociology|date=September 1994|volume=45|issue=3|pages=481–495|url=http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/classes/201/articles/94PilcherMannheimSocGenBJS.pdf|accessdate=10 October 2012|doi=10.2307/591659|jstor=591659}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generations in this sense of birth cohort, also known as "social generations", are widely used in popular culture, and have been the basis for sociological analysis. Serious analysis of generations began in the nineteenth century, emerging from an increasing awareness of the possibility of permanent social change and the idea of youthful rebellion against the established social order. Some analysts believe that a generation is one of the fundamental social categories in a society, while others view its importance as being overshadowed by other factors including class, gender, race, education, among others.

==Etymology==
The word ''generate'' comes from the [[Latin]] ''generāre'', meaning "to beget".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/generate |title=Generate &amp;#124; Define Generate at Dictionary.com |publisher=Dictionary.reference.com |date=15 June 1995 |accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''generation'' as a ''[[Cohort (statistics)|cohort]]'' in [[social science]] signifies the entire body of individuals born and living at about the same time, most of whom are approximately the same age and have similar ideas, problems, and attitudes (e.g., [[Beat Generation]] and [[Lost Generation]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dictionary.com definition of the word "generation"|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/generation?s=t}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Familial generation==
[[File:Lynch Armenia Five generations.png|thumb|right|Five generations of one Armenian family—a child with her mother, grandmother, great-grandmother and great-great-grandmother.]]

A familial generation is a group of living beings constituting a single step in the line of descent from an ancestor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Generation|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/generation|publisher=Miriam-Webster}}&lt;/ref&gt; In developed nations the [[generation time|average familial generation length]] is in the high 20s and has even reached 30 years in some nations.&lt;ref name="OECD"&gt;Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD) Social Policy Division [http://www.oecd.org/dataoecd/62/49/41919586.pdf] SF2.3: Mean age of mothers at first childbirth. Retrieved 15 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; Factors such as greater industrialisation and demand for cheap female labour, urbanisation, delayed first pregnancy and a greater uncertainty in relationship stability have all contributed to the increase of the generation length from the late 18th century to the present. These changes can be attributed to both social factors, such as [[GDP]] and state policy, and related individual-level variables, particularly a woman's educational attainment.&lt;ref&gt;Bedasso, Biniam Egu. {{cite web|url=http://www.uneca.org/acgs/mdgs/Education_Empirical_report.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=6 February 2016 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120601030316/http://www.uneca.org/acgs/mdgs/Education_Empirical_report.pdf |archivedate=1 June 2012 |df=dmy }} Investing in education as a means and as an end: exploring the microfoundations of the MDGs.

==Social generation==
Social generations are cohorts of people born in the same date range and who share similar cultural experiences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Mannheim|first1=k|title=Essays on the Sociology of Knowledge|date=1952|publisher=RKP|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The idea of a social generation, in the sense that it is used today, gained currency in the 19th century. Prior to that the concept "generation" had generally referred to family relationships and not broader social groupings. In 1863, French [[lexicographer]] [[Emile Littré]] had defined a generation as, "all men living more or less at the same time".&lt;ref name=Wohl203&gt;{{Cite book| last=Wohl | first=Robert | authorlink=Robert Wohl | title=The generation of 1914 | year=1979 | publisher=Harvard University Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts  | isbn=978-0-674-34466-2 | pages=203–209 | url=https://books.google.com/?id=YLe3e3FDXQkC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=wohl%201914&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several trends promoted a new idea of generations, as the 19th century wore on, of a society divided into different categories of people based on age. These trends were all related to the processes of [[modernisation]], [[industrialisation]], or [[westernisation]], which had been changing the face of Europe since the mid-18th century. One was a change in mentality about time and social change. The increasing prevalence of [[Age of Enlightenment|enlightenment]] ideas encouraged the idea that society and life were changeable, and that civilization could [[Social progress|progress]]. This encouraged the equation of youth with social renewal and change. Political rhetoric in the 19th century often focused on the renewing power of youth influenced by movements such as [[Young Italy]], [[Young Germany]], [[Sturm und Drang]], the [[German Youth Movement]], and other [[romantic movement]]s. By the end of the 19th century, European intellectuals were disposed toward thinking of the world in generational terms—in terms of youth rebellion and emancipation.&lt;ref name=Wohl203 /&gt;

Two important contributing factors to the change in mentality were the change in the economic structure of society. Because of the rapid social and economic change, young men particularly were less beholden to their fathers and family authority than they had been. Greater social and economic mobility allowed them to flout their authority to a much greater extent than had traditionally been possible. Additionally, the skills and wisdom of fathers were often less valuable than they had been due to technological and social change.&lt;ref name=Wohl203 /&gt; During this time, the period between [[childhood]] and [[adulthood]], usually spent at university or in military service, was also increased for many people entering [[White-collar worker|white-collar]] jobs. This category of people was very influential in spreading the ideas of youthful renewal.&lt;ref name=Wohl203 /&gt;

Another important factor was the breakdown of traditional social and regional identifications. The spread of [[nationalism]] and many of the factors that created it (a national press, linguistic homogenisation, [[public education]], suppression of local particularities) encouraged a broader sense of belonging beyond local affiliations. People thought of themselves increasingly as part of a society, and this encouraged identification with groups beyond the local.&lt;ref name=Wohl203 /&gt;[[Auguste Comte]] was the first philosopher to make a serious attempt to systematically study generations. In ''Cours de philosophie positive'' Comte suggested that social change is determined by generational change and in particular conflict between successive generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.ucsb.edu/faculty/marcuse/classes/201/articles/85JaegerGenInHistHISTTHEO.pdf |title=Hans Jaeger. Generations in History: Reflections on a Controversy. Translation of "Generationen in der Geschichte: Überlegungen zu einer umstrittenen Konzeption," originally published in Geschichte und Gesellschaft 3 (1977), 429–452. p 275. |format=PDF |accessdate=10 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the members of a given generation age, their "instinct of social conservation" becomes stronger, which inevitably and necessarily brings them into conflict with the "normal attribute of youth"—innovation. Other important theorists of the 19th century were [[John Stuart Mill]] and [[Wilhelm Dilthey]].

Sociologist [[Karl Mannheim]] was a seminal figure in the study of generations. He elaborated a [[theory of generations]] in his 1923 essay ''The Problem of Generations''.&lt;ref name="Pilcher" /&gt; He suggested that there had been a division into two primary schools of study of generations until that time.  Firstly, positivists such as Comte measured social change in designated life spans.  Mannheim argued that this reduced history to "a chronological table". The other school, the "romantic-historical" was represented by Dilthey and [[Martin Heidegger]]. This school focused on the individual qualitative experience at the expense of social context. Mannheim emphasised that the rapidity of social change in youth was crucial to the formation of generations, and that not every generation would come to see itself as distinct. In periods of rapid social change a generation would be much more likely to develop a cohesive character. He also believed that a number of distinct sub-generations could exist.&lt;ref name="Pilcher" /&gt;

According to Gilleard and Higgs, Mannheim identified three commonalities that a generation shares:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|authors=Gilleard, C. &amp; Higgs, P.|title=The third age: Class, cohort or generation?|journal=Ageing and Society|year=2002|volume=22|issue=3|pages=369–382|doi=10.1017/s0144686x0200870x}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Shared temporal location – generational site or birth cohort
* Shared historical location – generation as actuality or exposure to a common era
* Shared sociocultural location – generational consciousness or "[[entelechy]]"

Authors [[William Strauss]] and [[Neil Howe]] developed the [[Strauss-Howe generational theory]] outlining what they saw as a pattern of generations repeating throughout American history. This theory became quite influential with the public and reignited an interest in the sociology of generations. This led to the creation of an industry of consulting, publishing, and marketing in the field.&lt;ref name="COHE"&gt;{{cite web|first=Eric |last=Hoover|url=http://chronicle.com/article/The-Millennial-Muddle-How/48772/ |title=The Millennial Muddle|work=[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]] |date=11 October 2009 |accessdate=8 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theory has alternatively been criticized by social scientists and journalists who argue it is non-[[falsifiability|falsifiable]], [[determinism|deterministic]], and unsupported by rigorous evidence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Brooks|first1=David|authorlink=David Brooks (cultural commentator)|title=What's the Matter With Kids Today?

==Generational theory==

While the concept of a generation has a long history and can be found in ancient literature,&lt;ref name="Biggs 2007 695–711"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Biggs|first=Simon|title=Thinking about generations: Conceptual positions and policy implications.|journal=Journal of Social Issues|year=2007|volume=63|issue=4|pages=695–711|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.2007.00531.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; there are also psychological and sociological dimensions in the sense of belonging and identity which may define a generation.

The concept of a generation can also be used to locate particular birth cohorts in specific historical and cultural circumstances, such as the "[[Baby boomers]]".&lt;ref name="Biggs 2007 695–711"/&gt;

While all generations have similarities, there are differences among them as well. A 2007 [[Pew Research Center]] report called "Millennials: Confident. Connected. Open to Change" noted the challenge of studying generations: "Generational analysis has a long and distinguished place in social science, and we cast our lot with those scholars who believe it is not only possible, but often highly illuminating, to search for the unique and distinctive characteristics of any given age group of Americans. But we also know this is not an exact science. We are mindful that there are as many differences in attitudes, values, behaviors, and lifestyles within a generation as there are between generations. But we believe this reality does not diminish the value of generational analysis; it merely adds to its richness and complexity."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Millennials. Confident, Connected. Open to Change.|authors=Taylor, P. &amp; Keeter, S. (Eds.)|url=http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1501/millennials-new-survey-generational-personality-upbeat-open-new-ideas-technology-bound|pages=5|date=24 February 2010|access-date=24 February 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100227045407/http://pewresearch.org/pubs/1501/millennials-new-survey-generational-personality-upbeat-open-new-ideas-technology-bound|archive-date=27 February 2010|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another element of generational theory is recognizing how youth experience their generation, and how that changes based on where they reside in the world. "Analyzing young people's experiences in place contributes to a deeper understanding of the processes of individualization, inequality, and of generation."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Youth and Generation|last = Dan Woodman|first = Johanna Wyn|publisher = SAGE|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-4462-5904-7|location = Los Angeles, London, New Delhi.Singapore, Washington DC|pages = 164}}&lt;/ref&gt; Being able to take a closer looks at youth cultures and subcultures in different times and places adds an extra element to understanding the everyday lives of youth. This allows a better understanding of youth and the way generation and place play in their development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Youth and Generation Rethinking Change and Inequity in the Lives of Young People|last = Woodman|first = Dan|publisher = Sage Publications Ltd|year = 2015|isbn = 978-1-4462-5904-7|location = London|pages = 122|last2 = Wyn|first2 = Johanna}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is not where the birth cohort boundaries are drawn that is important, but how individuals and societies interpret the boundaries and how divisions may shape processes and outcomes. However, the practice of categorizing age cohorts is useful to researchers for the purpose of constructing boundaries in their work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grenier|first=Amanda|title=Crossing age and generational boundaries: Exploring intergenerational research encounters|journal=Journal of Social Issues|year=2007|volume=63|issue=4|pages=713–727|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.2007.00532.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Generational tension==

Norman Ryder, writing in ''[[American Sociological Review]]'' in 1965, shed light on the [[sociology]] of the discord between generations by suggesting that society "persists despite the mortality of its individual members, through processes of demographic metabolism and particularly the annual infusion of birth cohorts". He argued that generations may sometimes be a "threat to stability" but at the same time they represent "the opportunity for social transformation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ryder|first=Norman|title=The cohort as a concept in the study of social change|journal=[[American Sociological Review]]|year=1965|volume=30|issue=6|pages=843–861|doi=10.2307/2090964|jstor=2090964}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ryder attempted to understand the dynamics at play between generations.

Amanda Grenier, in a 2007 essay published in ''[[Journal of Social Issues]]'', offered another source of explanation for why generational tensions exist. Grenier asserted that generations develop their own linguistic models that contribute to misunderstanding between age cohorts, "Different ways of speaking exercised by older and younger people exist, and may be partially explained by social historical reference points, culturally determined experiences, and individual interpretations".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Grenier|first=Amanda|title=Crossing age and generational boundaries: Exploring intergenerational research encounters|journal=[[Journal of Social Issues]]|year=2007|volume=63|issue=4|page=718|doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.2007.00532.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Karl Mannheim]], in his 1952 book ''[[Essays on the Sociology of Knowledge]]'' asserted the belief that people are shaped through lived experiences as a result of social change. Howe and Strauss also have written on the similarities of people within a generation being attributed to social change. Based on the way these lived experiences shape a generation in regard to values, the result is that the new generation will challenge the older generation's values, resulting in tension. This challenge between generations and the tension that arises is a defining point for understanding generations and what separates them.&lt;ref&gt;Mannheim, Karl. (1952) 'The problem of generations', in K. Mannheim, Essays on the Sociology of Knowledge, London: RKP&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of generations==

===Western world===
[[Image:Baby Mother Grandmother and Great Grandmother.jpg|250px|thumb|This photograph depicts four generations of one family: a baby boy, his mother, his maternal grandmother, and one of his maternal great-grandmothers.]]
For the purposes of this list, "[[Western world]]" can be taken to include [[United States]], [[Canada]], [[Western Europe]], [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]]. Many variations may exist within these regions, both geographically and culturally, which means that the list is broadly indicative, but necessarily very general. The contemporary characterization of these cohorts used in media and advertising borrows from the [[Strauss–Howe generational theory]] among others.
*The [[Lost Generation]], also known as the ''Generation of 1914'' in Europe,&lt;ref name=Wohl&gt;{{Cite book| last=Wohl | first=Robert | title=The generation of 1914 | year=1979 | publisher=Harvard University Press | location=Cambridge, Massachusetts  | isbn=978-0-674-34466-2 | pages= | url=https://books.google.com/?id=YLe3e3FDXQkC&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=wohl%201914&amp;pg=PA1#v=onepage&amp;q=}}&lt;/ref&gt; is a term originating with [[Gertrude Stein]] to describe those who fought in [[World War I]]. The members of the lost generation were typically born between 1883 and 1900. All members of this generation are now deceased.
*The [[G.I. Generation]], is the generation that includes the [[veterans]] who fought in [[World War II]]. They were born from around 1901 to 1924, coming of age during the [[Great Depression]]. Journalist [[Tom Brokaw]] described American members of this cohort as the "greatest generation" in his book ''[[Greatest Generation|The Greatest Generation]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| last = Hunt | first = Tristram | date = 6 June 2004 | title = One last time they gather, the Greatest Generation | work = [[The Observer]] | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2004/jun/06/secondworldwar | accessdate = 24 August 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The [[Silent Generation]], also known as the ''Lucky Few'', were born from approximately 1925 to 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Strauss|first=William|title=Generations: The History of Americas Future, 1584 to 2069|year=1991|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-688-11912-3|pages=279|author2=Neil Howe}}&lt;/ref&gt; It includes some who fought in [[World War II]], most of those who fought the [[Korean War]] and many during the [[Vietnam War]].
*The [[Baby Boomer]]s, also known as the [[Me generation|Me Generation]], are the generation that were born mostly following [[World War II]]. There are no precise dates when the cohort birth years start and end. Typically, they range from the early-to-mid 1940s and end from 1960 to 1964. Increased birth rates were observed during the [[post–World War II baby boom]] making them a relatively large demographic cohort.&lt;ref&gt;See:

Demographers and researchers typically use starting birth years ranging from the early-to-mid 1960s and ending birth years in the early 1980s. The term has also been used in different times and places for a number of different [[subcultures]] or [[counterculture]]s since the 1950s.

Jackson, II&lt;/ref&gt; The drop in fertility rates in America began in the late 1950s. But according to authors and demographers William Strauss and Neil Howe (who use 1961 to 1981 for Gen X birth years), by 1991 there were approximately 88.5 million Gen Xers in the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=William Strauss|first=Neil Howe|title=Generations|year=1991|publisher=Harper Perennial|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-688-11912-3|page=318}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no precise dates for when this cohort starts or ends; demographers and researchers typically use the early 1980s as starting birth years and the mid 1990s to early 2000s as ending birth years. According to [[Pew Research]], in 2019, the Millennials will surpass the Baby Boomers in size in the U.S., with 72 million Boomers and 73 million Millennials.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2018/03/01/millennials-overtake-baby-boomers/|title=Pew Research Center, from Statistics Provided by US Dept.

* [[Generation Z]], also known as the ''iGeneration'', ''Post-Millennials'', ''Zoomers'', ''Homeland Generation'',&lt;ref name="Horovitz"/&gt; or ''Plurals''&lt;ref name="Horovitz"/&gt; is the cohort of people born after the Millennials. Demographers and researchers typically use the mid-1990s to mid-2000s as a starting birth years. There is little consensus regarding ending birth years.

*In the [[China|People's Republic of China]], the "[[Post-80s]]" (Chinese: 八零后世代 or 八零后) (born-after-1980 generation) are those who were born in the 1980s in urban areas of Mainland China. Growing up in modern China, the Post-80s has been characterised by its optimism for the future, newfound excitement for [[consumerism]] and [[entrepreneurship]] and acceptance of its historic role in transforming modern China into an [[World economy|economic]] power.&lt;ref name="Yan 2006 255-262"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Yan|first=Yunxiang|title=Little Emperors or Frail Pragmatists?

The lack of siblings has had profound psychological effects on this generation, such as [[egoism]] due to always being at the centre of parents' attention as well as the stress of having to be the sole provider once the parents retire.

Their campaigns include the fight for the preservation of [[Lee Tung Street]], the Star Ferry Pier and the Queen's Pier, Choi Yuen Tsuen Village, real political reform (on 23 June), and a citizen-oriented Kowloon West Art district. Their discourse mainly develops around themes such as [[anti-colonialism]], [[sustainable development]], and democracy.
*In [[Germany]], generations widely follow the Western world pattern but have many aspects of different ''[[Vergangenheitsbewältigung]]''. In German history the start and abolition of [[Gleichschaltung]] in [[mass movement]]s ([[nazism|Nazi]] ''[[Hitler Youth|Hitlerjugend]]'' and later [[communism|communist]] [[Free German Youth]]) also shaped generations.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The baby boomer generation was heavily challenging their parents and relatives with their past in [[Nazi Germany]] and in [[World War II]] as well as their (individual) [[responsibility for the Holocaust]] but also the survival of the ''Third Reich'' in (West) German administration, science, legislation and culture due to claimed unsuccessful [[denazification]]. It formed [[German student movement]] which translated West Germany in some aspects. Later, ''Generation Golf'' (named after the [[VW Golf]]) is very similar to Generation X describing the generation that was raised in late [[West Germany]] with the specific background of the german separation, then deadlocked [[German question]] and [[Cold War|cold-war threats]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} The east-german generation which was born in the mid-eighties and later was little influenced and indoctrinated by [[East Germany|East German]] Communist education system and not captured by [[Free German Youth]]. Children in the [[New states of Germany]] who were not older than seven years during [[german reunification]] are often in a stronger cultural contrast to their parents and relatives while those who were slightly older saw a massive change in their school system, syllabi and breakdown of the youth welfare but also unexpected opportunities and chances in [[History of Germany since 1990|modern Germany]].{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}
*In [[Poland]], two important groups with a shared generational identity are recognized: the [[Generation of Columbuses]], who were born during the brief period of Polish independence in the [[interbellum]] and survived World War II, and the "generation of free Poland", born after the dissolution of communism in 1989.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}}
*In [[Romania]], all people who were born in 1989 are called the [[Revolutionary generation|Revolution Generation]] because communism fell that year and Romania experienced a [[Romanian Revolution|violent revolution]] that ended the [[communist]] regime of [[Nicolae Ceaușescu]] and brought [[democracy]] to Romania.{{citation needed|date=August 2017}} There was also a demographic called "[[Decree 770|Decrețeii]]", representing those that were born during the effect of the communism regime applied Decree 770, which lasted between 1967 and 1989.

People born in the 1930s and 1940s tended to be loyal to the new state and tended to adhere to "traditional" divisions of society. Indian "boomers", those born after independence and into the early 1960s, tended to link success to leaving India and were more suspicious of traditional social institutions. Events like the [[Indian Emergency]] between 1975 and 1977 made them more sceptical of government. Gen Xers experienced India's economic ascendance and are more comfortable with diverse perspectives. Generation Y continues this pattern.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}
*In the [[Philippines]], people also identify with Western terms such as "Generation X" and "Millennials", with Filipinos born before or during the [[Second World War]] (as well as those living as adults in that period) constituting an unofficial generation.

==Other terminology==
The term generation is sometimes applied to a cultural movement, or more narrowly defined group than an entire demographic. Some examples include:

*The [[Stolen Generations]], refers to children of [[Aboriginal Australians]] and [[Torres Strait Islander]] (AATSI) descent, who were removed from their families by the Australian Federal and State government agencies and church missions, under acts of their respective parliaments between approximately 1869 and 1969.
*The [[Beat Generation]], refers to a popular American cultural movement widely cited by social scholars as having laid the foundation of the pro-active American [[counterculture of the 1960s]]. It consisted of Americans born between the two world wars who came of age in the rise of the automobile era, and the surrounding accessibility they brought to the culturally diverse, yet geographically broad and separated nation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.online-literature.com/periods/beat.php|title=The Beat Generation|accessdate=29 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green Maps''' are locally created environmentally themed maps with a universal [[symbol]] set and map-making resources provided by the non-profit Green Map System. Based on the principles of [[cartography]] a Green Map plots the locations of a community's natural, cultural and sustainable resources such as recycling centers, heritage sites, community gardens, toxic waste sites and socially [[conscious business]]es.

== History ==
Green Maps are an educational and environmental communication tool for advocacy and public awareness first created for New York City by eco-designer Wendy Brawer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ecocultural.info|title=Wendy E. Brawer|publisher=|accessdate=24 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; of Modern World Design in 1992 as seen at the [http://www.GreenAppleMap.org Green Apple Map] website. The global Green Map System was formed as a result of the response to this first Green Map. Since 1995, Green Mapmaking has grown steadily around the world.

[[File:About us staff.jpg|thumb|Green Map System's staff]]
Green Map’s office in New York City is the resource development, outreach and support center. Due to the growth in the number of projects a decentralized or "hub" based management system has been adopted. Green Map System has encouraged various regions to form local support networks. Green Map System and its network of regional hubs and community-led Green Map projects share their outcomes.

The website GreenMap.org is the gathering point for both the makers and the users of Green Maps. GreenMap.org went online in 1995 and it was re-launched in May 2007, with a resource center for Mapmakers all over the world to communicate and exchange their Green Map making experience. This content management system is named as [[Greenhouse]], symbolizing its ability to cultivate and present a “garden of Green Maps”.

Although Green Map System authorizes local mapmakers to use its  [http://www.greenmap.org/greenhouse/participate Green Mapmaking] icons and tools, every project is independent and locally led. Grassroots and established non-profits, universities and schools, governmental and tourism agencies use the icons and adaptable methodologies to develop and publish their own community's Green Map in a way that meets the needs of residents and visitors.

== Branding and spelling ==
While Green Map System prefers and promotes the spelling "Green Map" to preserve trademark claims,&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Brawer, e-mail message to Jerrad Pierce, November 21, 2004 regarding word choice in [http://cambridgema.greenmap.org/misc/Thesis.pdf "Improving the Cartographic Quality of Green Maps"]&lt;/ref&gt;
"green map" and "greenmap" are often used by local Green Map projects. Green Map System is concerned with maintaining control of copyright and trademark in order to preserve the perceived integrity of the system; they wish to prevent the use of Green Maps in [[greenwash]]ing&lt;ref&gt;Brawer, Wendy. "Copyright &amp; Icon updating".  11 December 2004. [http://www.greenmap.com/gm/forum/viewtopic.php?p=90 http://www.greenmap.com/gm/forum/viewtopic.php?p=90] (31 August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt; and do not allow public use of their assets.&lt;ref&gt;Green Map System, "Mapmaker Checklist". 22 September 2003. [http://www.greenmap.org/report/checklist03.txt http://www.greenmap.org/report/checklist03.txt](31 August 2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

The Green Map tagline is “Think Global, Map Local!”. It’s a play on the familiar think global - act local, and implies the same depth of local involvement for positive change.

All Green Maps use a set of globally designed [http://www.greenmap.org/greenhouse/about/iconintro Green Icons], developed collaboratively by the network of local project leaders. Allegedly this is the world’s only universal symbol set for maps. The globally designed icons ensure that all Green Maps engage and guide a diversity of users. Because concepts of sustainability are continually evolving, Green Mapmakers have developed the third version of the symbols, released in March 2008. Provided as a font for ease of use or as stickers for youth/computer-less Green Mapmakers.

'''Groom kidnapping''', colloquially known as '''Pakaruah shaadi''' or '''Jabaria shaadi''', is a phenomenon in the western parts of [[Bihar]], and eastern [[Uttar Pradesh]] states in India, wherein eligible bachelors are abducted by the [[bride]]'s family and later forcefully married, to avoid heavy [[dowry]] costs. Considering the traditional regard for the [[Indian wedding|marriage sacrament]], most such marriages are not annulled. Additionally, the groom may suffer criminal charges under [[Dowry law in India|Indian dowry law]], and end up fighting lengthy legal battles.

{{Kidnapping}}

The practice started becoming noticeable towards the late 20th century, as dowry costs became prohibitive and organized gangs came forward to carry out the abductions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last= Das|first=Arvind N.|title=The Republic of Bihar|year=1992|publisher=Penguin Books|isbn=0-14-012351-2|page=70}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ab&gt;{{cite book|last=Abraham|first=M. Francis |title=The agony of India: reflections of an angry Indian|year=1998|publisher=EastWest Books|isbn=81-86852-15-8|page=215}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, 1224 kidnappings for marriage were reported in Bihar, carried out on behalf of the families of the brides.&lt;ref name="aus"/&gt;

== Overview ==

The practice, which is a fallout of the [[dowry]] custom, first came to light in the 1980s. It has since gained social sanction among the upper castes like the [[Bhumihar]]s,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Das|first=Arvind N. |title=The state of Bihar: an economic history without footnotes|year=1992|publisher=VU University Press|isbn=90-5383-135-5|page=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly in parts of America and England, where dowry demands are high. Demanding a dowry has been illegal in India for over 50 years, since the passage of the [[Dowry law in India#The 1961 Dowry Prohibition Act|Dowry Prohibition Act of 1961]].&lt;ref name="tto"/&gt; In the practice, potential bridegrooms, usually from well-off families are targeted. Young men who have either cleared their [[Indian Administrative Services|IAS]] exams, have a medical or engineering degree or have secured a government job, are targeted by families who can’t afford big dowries. These 'grooms' are abducted, held captive and often beaten into submission before later being forcibly married, often at gun-point with a rope tied around their waist so they can't run away. Subsequently, if the groom tries to extricate himself from the marriage, he faces lengthy legal battles and even criminal charges under Indian Dowry law, which is geared towards protecting the rights of women in the marriage as in most cases, the bride's family is financially strong and politically connected. Over the years, organized criminals have become part of the practice, as they carry out abductions for a fee and also guarantee post-marriage "compliance" by the groom for an extra fee. Thus many such marriages go unreported and often continue under fear of violence from local criminals.&lt;ref name="si"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/articles/2003/10/03/1064988410945.html|title=Why bachelors of Bihar are terrified|date=October 4, 2003|work=Sydney Morning Herald}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="alt"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alternet.org/sex/142785/men_kidnapped_and_forced_into_marriage/|title=Men Kidnapped and Forced Into Marriage|date=September 21, 2009|publisher=[[AlterNet]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As early as 1993, the magazine ''[[India Today]]'' reported such kidnappings by "social groups," one of which had formed in 1982 in Bihar, to kidnap grooms who demanded heavy dowries and forcibly marry them.&lt;ref&gt;''[[India Today]]'', Volume 18, Issues 13-17, 1993.''Page 13''.&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, if the groom asks for too large a dowry or backs out of a marriage owing to dowry issues, the girl's family resorts to such measures, having the groom abducted via criminal gangs.&lt;ref name="aus"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theaustralian.com.au/news/world/bachelor-snatchers-after-suitable-boys/story-e6frg6so-1225818565087|title=Bachelor snatchers after suitable boys|date=January 13, 2010|work=The Australian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Housing affordability ==
Further, the high costs of construction materials – imported for the most part – combined with prohibitive interest rates – in the range of 8-10% according to BHS, the housing bank – have made housing too expensive for the average Senegalese and for low-income families.&lt;ref name=ccg/&gt; As a result, there is a critical shortage of affordable housing, and the Government has estimated at 120,000 the number of units to be built every year in order to meet a growing demand.&lt;ref name=ccg/&gt;  

Under President [[Abdoulaye Wade]]’s initiative “one family-one home”, a battery of incentives has been presented to potential homebuilders, as long as the cost of the house does not exceed [[CFA Franc]] 7 million ($15,500).&lt;ref name=ccg/&gt; They range from providing free land to homebuilders, a 3.3% subsidy to the target buyers of the houses, and tax holidays for imported construction equipment.&lt;ref name=ccg/&gt;

'''John Dall''' (May 26, 1920 – January 15, 1971)&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt;{{refn|name=birthyear|group=Note}} was an American actor.

He first came to fame as the young prodigy who comes alive under the tutelage of [[Bette Davis]] in ''[[The Corn Is Green (1945 film)|The Corn Is Green]]'' (1945), for which he was nominated for the [[Academy Award for Best Supporting Actor]].

Hollywood pimp [[Scotty Bowers]] has claimed that Dall was one of his most unusual clients, and liked to be tied upside down to trees in Laurel Canyon in the middle of the night. "He liked to hang upside down naked until morning. Once a week he wanted this."&lt;ref&gt;[https://twitter.com/ScottyBowers/status/1033814432143396864 Scotty Bowers: Twitter, 27 Aug 2018]&lt;/ref&gt; According to music journalist Phil Milstein, at the time of his death Dall had lapsed into alcoholism and was living with his partner, actor Clement Brace (died 1996).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Milstein |first1=Phil |title=The Nightmare World of Dion McGregor |url=http://www.songpoemmusic.com/dion/chapters/9.htm |website=American Song-Poem Music Archives |accessdate=February 4, 2015 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6W5ODg9sP?url=http://www.songpoemmusic.com/dion/chapters/9.htm |archivedate=February 4, 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Israel|first1=Lee|authorlink1=Lee Israel|title=Can You Ever Forgive Me?

'''Koreans in Mongolia''' form one of the [[Korean diaspora]] communities in Asia. They consist of both [[North Korea|North]] and [[South Korea]]n expatriates.

==South Koreans==
===Population and business activities===
In 1994, there were estimated to be around 100 South Korean expatriates in Mongolia.&lt;ref name="Eyeglasses"&gt;{{citation|date=2003-08-28|accessdate=2009-01-27|periodical=Dongpo News|title='몽골에서 안경점 하는 한인도 있습니다' ('In Mongolia, there are even Koreans running eyeglasses shops')|last=Gang|first=Guk-jin|url=http://www.dongponews.net/news/articleView.html?idxno=1025}}&lt;/ref&gt; Official statistics from South Korea's [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade (South Korea)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs and Trade]] showed 270 of their nationals in Mongolia in 1997, and about eight times as many by 2013.&lt;ref name="MOFAT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.okf.or.kr/data/status_AS.jsp|title=재외동포현황 - 아시아 (Status of overseas compatriots - Asia)|publisher=Overseas Korean Foundation|year=2005|accessdate=2009-01-28|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060212042424/http://www.okf.or.kr/data/status_AS.jsp|archivedate=2006-02-12|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some unofficial estimates suggest that their population might be as large as 3,500 individuals.&lt;ref name="3500SouthKoreans"&gt;{{citation|periodical=YTN News|url=http://www.ytn.co.kr/global_korean/global_view.php?key=200807050858441453&amp;s_mcd=0930&amp;s_hcd=19|date=2008-07-05|accessdate=2009-01-27|title=유혈 사태, 평온 회복 중}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aside from residents, the number of South Korean tourists has also shown an upward trend, reaching 40,000 individuals in 2007.&lt;ref name="SexTourism"&gt;{{citation|url=http://english.hani.co.kr/arti/english_edition/e_international/298846.html |periodical=The Hankyoreh |title=In Mongolia, sex tourism by S.

Many South Korean expatriates operate small businesses; the number of businesses in Mongolia funded by South Korean capital was estimated at 1,500 {{asof|2008|lc=on}}.&lt;ref name="3500SouthKoreans"/&gt; The various types of businesses include restaurants serving [[Korean cuisine]], [[Karaoke Box|karaoke bars]], and even eyeglass shops.&lt;ref name="Eyeglasses"/&gt;&lt;ref name="SexTourism"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Restaurant"&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.donga.com/docs/magazine/viewer.php?mgz_part=weekly&amp;n=200301090500054|title=몽골 상류층 사로잡은 ‘한국의 맛’ (The 'Korean flavour' captivating Mongolian high society)|periodical=Weekly Dong-A|date=2003-01-09|accessdate=2009-01-28|issue=368|pages=57–58|last=U|first=Gil}}&lt;/ref&gt; A weekend language and culture school for Korean children was set up in 1998 by a local Korean church.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Ulaanbaatar MK School/몽골선교사자녀학교|accessdate=2009-05-15|url=http://www.mkschool.org/index.php}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under a bilateral agreement, both South Koreans working in Mongolia as well as [[Mongolians in South Korea|Mongolians working in South Korea]] are exempted from otherwise-mandatory contributions to the national pension plans of the country they reside in.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=South Korean president in Mongolia|date=2006-05-18|accessdate=2009-01-27|periodical=The Mongol Messenger|url=http://www.mongolmessenger.mn/issue/060518.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ethnic tensions ===
The growth of the South Korean presence has caused some tensions with their Mongolian hosts. In 2005, Korean-owned businesses in Ulan Bator which displayed ''[[hangul]]'' signs were ordered to switch them to English or Mongolian only, a situation which South Korean news agency [[YTN]] attributed to growing Mongolian nationalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.ytn.co.kr/global_korean/global_view.php?key=200512292116485263&amp;s_mcd=0930&amp;s_hcd=19|date=2005-12-29|accessdate=2009-01-27|periodical=YTN News|title=몽골에 부는 민족주의 바람  (The wind of ethnonationalism blowing in Mongolia)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the numerous South Korean owned businesses are a number of [[karaoke]] bars operating as fronts for prostitution, which are frequented by clients of South Korean-run businesses in Mongolia (growing from just one in 2002 to an estimated fifty as of 2005).
==North Koreans==

As of May 2008, roughly 200 North Korean citizens worked in Mongolia.&lt;ref name="HuralApproval"&gt;{{citation|title=Parliament considers law to expand North Korean employment in Mongolia|periodical=Mongolia Web|date=2008-05-12|accessdate=2009-01-27|url=http://www.mongolia-web.com/1751-parliament-considers-law-expand-north-korean-employment-mongolia}}&lt;/ref&gt; In February 2008, Ulan Bator and Pyongyang reached an agreement which would allow as many as 5,300 North Korean workers to come to Mongolia over the following five years.&lt;ref name="HRW"&gt;{{citation|periodical=Human Rights Watch|title=Mongolia: Protect Rights of North Korean Migrant Workers|date=2008-08-19|accessdate=2009-01-27|url=https://www.hrw.org/en/news/2008/08/19/mongolia-protect-rights-north-korean-migrant-workers}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relevant agreement came before the [[State Great Hural]] for approval in May that year.&lt;ref name="HuralApproval"/&gt; An open letter from American NGO [[Human Rights Watch]] in August called on Mongolian Minister of Social Welfare and Labor [[Damdiny Demberel]] to ensure that the workers' freedom of expression, movement, and association would be respected; North Korean workers in similar positions in Europe were often denied such rights by their North Korean government minders.&lt;ref name="HRW"/&gt; The South Korean ambassador described Mongolia's decision to import North Korean workers as "problematic".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=BCM Mongolia Meeting: Peter Morrow Hands Over Chair|date=2008-07-04|accessdate=2009-01-27|periodical=Mongolia Web|url=http://www.mongolia-web.com/1866-bcm-mongolia-meeting-peter-morrow-hands-over-chair}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Defectors===
[[File:North Korean defector routes map.png|thumb|upright=1.5|North Korean defectors often pass through Mongolia on their way to South Korea.]]
{{asof|2006}}, it was estimated that 500 [[North Korean defectors]] entered Mongolia each month, largely by way of neighbouring [[China]].&lt;ref name="Nocamps"&gt;{{citation|periodical=Gulf Times |publication-place=Qatar |url=http://www.gulf-times.com/site/topics/article.asp?cu_no=2&amp;item_no=119099&amp;version=1&amp;template_id=45&amp;parent_id=25 |date=2006-11-24 |accessdate=2009-01-27 |title=Mongolia not planning camps for N.

As early as 2004, some South Korean citizens' groups had begun laying plans to construct camps in Mongolia to house North Korean refugees; however, they were denied permission by the Mongolian government.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=Radio Free Asia|url=http://www.rfa.org/korean/news/2004/11/09/mongol/|archiveurl=http://www.rfa.org/korean/news/2004/11/09/mongol/|archivedate=2005-11-14|date=2004-11-09|accessdate=2009-01-27|title=몽골, 탈북자 정착촌건립 허용 못한다고 (Mongolia cannot give permission to set up camps for North Korean defectors)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2005, South Korean NGO Rainbow Foundation stated that they had been granted 1.3 square kilometres of land near Ulan Bator, and would soon begin construction on a centre which could house as many as 200 North Korean refugees &lt;ref&gt;{{citation|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061003013139/http://www.rfa.org/english/news/politics/2005/09/06/nkorea_mongolia/|url=http://www.rfa.org/english/news/politics/2005/09/06/nkorea_mongolia/|date=2005-09-06|accessdate=2009-01-27|archivedate=2006-10-03|title=Center Offers Haven For North Korean Defectors in Mongolia|periodical=Radio Free Asia}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, during his November 2006 trip to Beijing, [[Prime Minister of Mongolia|Mongolian prime minister]] [[Miyeegombyn Enkhbold]] denied reports that his country was planning to set up any refugee camps for North Koreans, though he reaffirmed that they would be treated in a humanitarian manner.&lt;ref name="Nocamps"/&gt; In October 2008, [[President of South Korea|South Korean president]] [[Lee Myung-bak]] was reported to have ordered his officials to look further into the possibility of setting up a camp for them in Mongolia.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://mongolia-web.com/2019-report-mongolia-could-host-north-korean-refugee-camp|periodical=Mongolia Web|title=Report: Mongolia could host North Korean refugee camp|date=2008-10-02|accessdate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mongolian government does have facilities to provide shelter for North Korean refugees on their territory; in December 2007, [[Vitit Muntarbhorn]], the [[United Nations]] [[United Nations Special Rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]] on Human Rights in North Korea, praised Mongolia's treatment of North Korean refugees in an official report, noting that they had made commendable progress in improving such facilities since his previous visit.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mongolia praised for improved treatment of North Korean refugees|periodical=Mongolia Web|date=2007-12-25|accessdate=2009-01-27|url=http://www.mongolia-web.com/1558-mongolia-praised-improved-treatment-north-korean-refugees}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Both the Mongolian and South Korean governments' policies towards refugees have shifted several times. In June 2007, Mongolia began to turn North Korean refugees away from their borders, reportedly with the aim of improving [[Mongolia–North Korea relations|their diplomatic relations with North Korea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Mongolia closes border to fleeing North Koreans|periodical=Mongolia Web|url=http://www.mongolia-web.com/1072-mongolia-closes-borders-fleeing-north-koreans|date=2007-06-06|accessdate=2009-01-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in October 2007, the South Korean side was reported to be "closing the door" to North Korean refugees in Mongolia and Southeast Asia; North Korea watcher [[Andrei Lankov]], a professor at Seoul's [[Kookmin University]], attributed this to a deliberate policy by the South Korean government to minimise the number of new refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|periodical=Mongolia Web|title=North Koreans may find door shut to South Korea|url=http://www.mongolia-web.com/1392-north-koreans-mongolia-may-find-door-shut-south-korea|accessdate=2009-01-27|date=2007-10-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a '''list of countries by [[distribution of wealth]]''', including [[Gini coefficient]]s.  Wealth distribution can vary greatly from [[income distribution]] in a country. See: [[List of countries by income equality]].

Higher Gini coefficients signify greater inequality in wealth distribution, with 0 being complete equality, whereas a value near 1 can arise in a situation where everybody has zero wealth except a very small minority. "The top 10 percent owned 71 percent of world wealth, and the Gini coefficient for the global distribution of wealth is estimated to be 0.804, indicating greater inequality than that observed in the global distribution of consumption or income."&lt;ref name=2008april&gt;[http://www.nber.org/papers/w15508 The Level and Distribution of Global Household Wealth]. April 2008. By James B. Davies, Susanna Sandström, [[Anthony Shorrocks]], and Edward N. Wolff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Aspasia's writings do not remain, but she is mentioned by writers such as [[Plato]] in regard to her contributions to rhetoric. She also said to have taught other women how to carry themselves and speak to groups of people intelligently.  Aspasia was a great rhetor and was said to have written the famous speech given at Pericles' funeral.

Aspasia's rhetoric and social contributions were seen through a gendered lens.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ritchie|first=Joy|title=Available Means: An Anthology of Women's Rhetoric(s)|year=2001|publisher=University of Pittsburgh Press|location=Pittsburgh|isbn=0-8229-5753-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While at Vassar, Buck wrote a number of poems, plays, essays, and textbooks, however her goal was not to become widely published but rather she put her focus on restructuring the Vassar curriculum. “The Present Status of Rhetorical Theory” (1900) documents Buck's ideas against Sophist rhetoric, calling it “socially irresponsible” because it only developed around the idea of persuasion not action. Buck's writings developed around the idea of incorporating individuals with the social community in pursuit of truth.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/faculty/prominent-faculty/gertrude-buck%20.html]&lt;/ref&gt;

She graduate in 1876, becoming a Vassar Librarian before earning her Master's of the Arts in English in 1878. In 1884, the Smith College President L. Clark Seelye lured her away from Vassar to his college: she became an assistant professor in rhetoric and Anglo-Saxon; she was able to maintain her teaching positions until she retired in 1921 because she never married, as was custom at that time.

In 1906, she became a full professor at Smith College, as well as the head of the English Department while also serving as an informal adviser to three Smith presidents. As a professor, she was known to encourage honesty and freedom of expression and motivated student self-criticism without loss of self-confidence.

In 1910, she was presented with a Smith College honorary doctorate of Humane Letters, and in 1921, she was then presented with a Syracuse University doctorate of Pedagogy. In that same year, she retired from her teaching position and went to New Haven. In 1922, a house on the east side of the [[Smith College]] Quadrangle was named for her. She eventually died in 1941.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mary Augusta Jordan|url=http://vcencyclopedia.vassar.edu/alumni/mary-augusta-jordan.html|work=Biography|publisher=Vassar College|accessdate=2 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As for her writings, Jordan encouraged an understanding of "proper" usage of English grammar, but she acknowledged that writing and speaking embodied different aspects of the English language. "Proper" English was, according to her, whatever one interpreted it to be and how one proceeded to use it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ritchie|first=Joy S.|title=Available Means: an Anthology of Women's Rhetoric|year=2001|publisher=University of Pittsburgh|location=Pittsburgh|pages=218}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Media freedom in Russia#Assaults on journalists|dangers to journalists in Russia]] have been well known since the early 1990s but concern over the number of unsolved killings soared after [[Anna Politkovskaya]]'s murder in Moscow on 7 October 2006. While international monitors mentioned a dozen deaths, some sources within Russia talked of over two hundred fatalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transcripts.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0712/09/se.02.html|title=''Czar Putin'', CNN.|publisher=Transcripts.cnn.com|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The evidence has since been examined and documented in two reports, published in Russian and English, by international organizations. These revealed a basic confusion in terminology that explained the seemingly enormous numerical discrepancy: statistics of premature death among journalists (from work accidents, crossfire incidents, and purely criminal or domestic cases of manslaughter) were repeatedly equated with the much smaller number of targeted (contract) killings or work-related murders.
The [[Remembrance Day of Journalists Killed in the Line of Duty]] in Russia is observed on 15 December every year.

== Methodology ==
Among international monitors, the figures quoted for deaths of journalists in Russia have varied, sometimes considerably. There are several explanations. Firstly, certain organisations are concerned with all aspects of safety in news gathering so the International Federation of Journalists and the [[International News Safety Institute]] also record accidents that have occurred at work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111202205415/http://www.newssafety.org/images/pdf/KillingtheMessenger.pdf KILLING THE MESSENGER: The report on the global inquiry into the protection of journalists], INSI: Brussels, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly, some monitoring bodies include only fatalities in crossfire and dangerous assignments and those murders where they feel sure of the motive behind the lethal attack and can with confidence lobby the appropriate government; the CPJ adopts this approach. Thirdly, the term "journalist" is used by monitors as a general term to cover many different occupations within the media. Some include support staff, others do not.

In any list of deaths, compiled by monitors inside or outside the country, Russia ranks near the top for deaths. When the killing began, the brief [[First Chechen War]] took numerous journalists' lives from within Chechnya and abroad. There were also increased peacetime deaths of journalists elsewhere in the Russian Federation.

Those deliberately targeted for their work tended to be reporters, correspondents, and editors. In Russia many directors of new regional TV and radio stations have been murdered&lt;ref&gt;"Contract killings", p. 21, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110610160910/http://www.ifj.org/assets/docs/235/009/f99d3eb-c1b1209.pdf PARTIAL JUSTICE], IFJ: Brussels, June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/incident:homicide/job:director |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726211634/http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/incident%3Ahomicide/job%3Adirector |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 July 2011 |title=JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, An online database, "Homicide of media directors" |publisher=Journalists-in-russia.org |accessdate=18 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; but some of these deaths are thought to relate to conflicting business interests. Photographers and cameramen are vulnerable in crossfire situations, such as the October 1993 days in Moscow and the armed conflict in the North Caucasus.

== 2009 reports on deaths of journalists in Russia==
In June 2009 a wide-ranging investigation by the [[International Federation of Journalists]] into the deaths of journalists in Russia was published. At the same time, the IFJ launched an online database&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090709092723/http://www.journalists-in-russia.org/ JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, Deaths and Disappearances: An online database] IFJ, October 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090710122333/http://journalists-in-russia.org/rjournalists ЖУРНАЛИСТЫ В РОССИИ. Смерти и исчезновения. База данных] Международная федерация журналистов.&lt;/ref&gt; which documents over three hundred deaths and disappearances since 1993. Both the report ''Partial Justice''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ifj.org/fileadmin/images/Killed_List/Partial_Justice__An_Inquiry_into_Deaths_of_Journalists_in_Russia_93-09.pdf PARTIAL JUSTICE: An inquiry into the deaths of journalists in Russia, 1993-2009], IFJ: Brussels, June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; (Russian version: ''Частичное правосудие''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110722133010/http://www.ruj.ru/2009/pjustice_090909.pdf ЧАСТИЧНОЕ ПРАВОСУДИЕ. Исследование смертей журналистов в России, 1993-2009]. Международная федерация журналистов.&lt;/ref&gt;) and the database depend on the information gathered in Russia over the last 16 years by the country's own media monitors: the [[Glasnost Defense Foundation]] and the [[Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations]].

In September, in the report ''Justice'', the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] repeated its conclusion that Russia was one of the deadliest countries in the world for journalists and added that it remains among the worst at solving their murders. Journalists died or were killed, the CPJ argued, because of the work they were doing and only one case has led to a partially successful prosecution.

Following Russia's media monitors, the IFJ database of deaths and disappearances in Russia takes into account the entire range of media occupations and every degree of uncertainty as to the motive for many of the attacks. It also allows for selection and analysis. It classifies the way in which a journalist died (homicide, accident, crossfire, terrorist act, or not confirmed) and it assesses each death as certainly, possibly,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/motive:xJ |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726211642/http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/motive%3AxJ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 July 2011 |title=JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, An online database,"Deaths possibly linked to work" |publisher=Journalists-in-russia.org |access-date=18 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; or most probably not, linked to the journalist's work.

Since the early 1990s, Russia's media monitors have recorded every violent or suspicious death that came to their attention. Determining which were linked to the journalist's work has not always been easy since law enforcement agencies in Russia were struggling to cope with a wave of murders and the number of unsolved killings of journalists steadily mounted. In the last few years,{{When|date=June 2017}} the Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations has gathered all available information about these deaths on its Memoriam site.&lt;ref&gt;[http://memorium.cjes.ru/?pid=1&amp;l=Г/ MEMORIUM. Погибшие и пропавшие без вести журналисты]. The site covers the entire Commonwealth of Independent States.&lt;/ref&gt; This made it possible to check how much these deaths have been investigated and how many have led to court cases. The IFJ data base summarises the information accumulated on the Memoriam site and makes it available in English for the first time. During a study of international fraud-detection homicide, which compared fraud detection homicide cases from the United States of America against fraud detection homicide cases from the former Soviet Republic, the murder of Paula Klebenikov illustrated a case of a contract killing of a journalist known to expose fraud in governments.  At the time of his murder, he was thought to be investigating complex money laundering fraud scheme involving Chechen reconstruction projects. The investigation appears to reveal that Klebnikov had discovered that the fraud reached deep into the centers of power in the Kremlin, elements involving organized crime, and also the former KGB, now known as the FSB.&lt;ref&gt;Perri, Frank S. and Lichtenwald, Terrance G. (2008).

== ''Partial Justice'' and ''Anatomy of Injustice'' ==
The IFJ report ''Partial Justice'' maps the changing contours of impunity in Russia. It shows and explains the process whereby particular deaths are selected by the IFJ, CPJ, and other monitors. It stresses the need for an end to total impunity in those remaining regions (the North Caucasus, St Petersburg) where no one has ever been prosecuted for killing a journalist,&lt;ref name="PARTIAL JUSTICE, June 2009"&gt;See charts 2 &amp; 3, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110610160910/http://www.ifj.org/assets/docs/235/009/f99d3eb-c1b1209.pdf PARTIAL JUSTICE, June 2009]. "Killing with impunity in Russia, 1993-2008", pp. 11, 12.&lt;/ref&gt; and for an advance beyond partial justice in those cases where it is known, or strongly suspected, that the murder of a journalist was planned and premeditated. It is not enough to put the killer on trial; they must be accompanied, or followed, by their accomplices, and the intermediaries and individuals who ordered and paid for the killing.

The IFJ report opens and closes with the Politkovskaya murder and the subsequent trial, which ran from November 2008 to February 2009. After 16 years of unsolved killings, the international outcry over her death made this a test case that might finally breach the barrier of partial justice. The evidence presented by the prosecution, unfortunately, did not convince the jury or satisfy other key participants.&lt;ref&gt;See [https://web.archive.org/web/20090906133824/http://en.novayagazeta.ru/data/2009/18/00.html "The whole system stands condemned", 20 February 2009, Novaya gazeta]. Transcript of press conference following verdict.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Anatomy of Injustice'', the report by the CPJ, displays the conclusions the Committee has reached about certain deaths since 2000: the authorities do not acknowledge some of these deaths as homicide,&lt;ref&gt;See discussion of Makeyev, Shchekochikhin and Safronov cases, [http://cpj.org/reports/CPJ.Anatomy%20of%20Injustice.pdf ANATOMY OF INJUSTICE, September 2009] pp. 24-25, 26-27,&lt;/ref&gt; while several others reached the courts but have led at most to the conviction of the perpetrator, not those who ordered the killing.

Following different routes the two reports reach a similar set of recommendations. They call on Russian authorities to give investigators and courts the backing they need to identify and pursue all those responsible for the deaths of journalists and, in the meanwhile, to keep the press and the public better informed about their progress in tackling such disturbing crimes.

== International comparisons ==
In the 1990s and early 2000's the [[List of countries by intentional homicide rate|homicide rate in Russia]] was among the highest in the world.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/russian-murder-rate-among-worlds-worst-1486129.html Russian murder rate among world's worst]". ''The Independent.'' 20 July 1993.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-11538.html Russia – Crime Statistics]".

''The New York Times.'' 1995.&lt;/ref&gt; The CPJ lists Russia as "the third deadliest country in the world for journalists" since 1991, exceeded in the number of deaths only by Algeria (1993–1996) and post-invasion Iraq.&lt;ref name=cpj2&gt;[http://www.canada.ifex.org/fr/content/view/full/84529/ "Exiled journalists, CPJ brief US congressional caucus on dangers facing Russian journalists"], CPJ news release, 28 June 2007. Retrieved 8 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; It is more revealing, perhaps,{{According to whom|date=June 2017}} to set Russia alongside its G20 partners — not just the USA and France, but also Saudi Arabia and China (see Table 1, in the IFJ report).&lt;ref&gt;"Some international comparisons", p. 9, [https://web.archive.org/web/20110610160910/http://www.ifj.org/assets/docs/235/009/f99d3eb-c1b1209.pdf PARTIAL JUSTICE], IFJ: Brussels, June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Russia's problem, shared by certain other members of G20 ([[List of journalists and media workers killed in Mexico|India]], [[Crime in Brazil|Brazil]], and [[List of journalists and media workers killed in Mexico|Mexico]]), is not simply one of the number of deaths but that killing with impunity has persisted over time. The varied conditions in these economically important countries highlight a further crucial dimension. The killing of journalists may be the most dramatic and frequently quoted "barometer of press freedom"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gdf.ru/digest/item/9/257 Джон Кроуфут, "Барометры свободы", Дайджест ФЗГ, 18 февраля 2008]; in English "Barometers of Freedom", ''Index on Censorship'', Issue 1, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; but it is by no means the only measure. What it signifies for a particular country can only be properly gauged in the wider context of press freedom and other liberties, present (or absent) in that society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/How-the-index-was-drawn-up.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091002122441/http://www.rsf.org/How-the-index-was-drawn-up.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 October 2009 |title="How the index was drawn up", 23 October 2002, Reporters without Borders |publisher=Rsf.org |access-date=18 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Very few journalists have been killed in China&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cpj.org/killed/asia/china/|title=CPJ: Killed in China since 1992|publisher=Cpj.org|accessdate=18 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and none, it would seem, in North Korea. Other shortcomings ensure those countries occupy a lower position than Russia on any index of press freedom.

[[Mikhail Beketov]] initially survived a 2008 attack and died five years later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/04/09/world/europe/mikhail-beketov-russian-journalist-beaten-in-2008-dies.html|title=Mikhail Beketov, Russian Journalist Beaten in 2008, Dies|first=Ellen|last=Barry|date=8 April 2013|publisher=|access-date=15 June 2017|via=NYTimes.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Immediate death is the extreme end of the spectrum of threats and intimidation.

== Deaths and trials, statistics ==
The violent deaths of journalists started in the Yeltsin era (1991–1999) and continued under Putin, president of Russia from 31 December 1999 to 7 May 2008.&lt;ref name="russland"&gt;Gabriele Krone-Schmalz, "Press freedom", in ''Was passiert in Russland?'' F.A. Herbig: Munich, 2008 (4th edn.), pp. 81–98 (in German).&lt;/ref&gt; When Medvedev became president, he spoke of the need to end "[[legal nihilism]]".{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} From 2003 to 2008 there have been a rising number of trials&lt;ref name="PARTIAL JUSTICE, June 2009"/&gt; but by November 2009 there had yet to be a major breakthrough, under Medvedev, of either in the prosecution of pre-2008 deaths or the investigation of killings since his May 2008 inauguration. The Politkovskaya murder trial and the first arrests in the Baburova-Markelov slaying (November 2009) showed some inconclusive signs of movement.

The yearly figures in the table above are derived from the "journalists in Russia" database, where details can be found on each individual death. Certain important{{According to whom|date=June 2017}} categories are not included. Those who have gone "missing" (14 persons);&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/incident:missing |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726211442/http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/incident%3Amissing |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 July 2011 |title=JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, An online database, "Those missing since 1993" |publisher=Journalists-in-russia.org |access-date=18 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; those who died in an incident ("not confirmed", 28 persons), the nature of which has not been satisfactorily established; and journalists killed in work-related accidents (37 persons),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/motive:J/incident:accident |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726211648/http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/motive%3AJ/incident%3Aaccident |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 July 2011 |title=JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, An online database, "Work-related accidents since 1993" |publisher=Journalists-in-russia.org |access-date=18 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; may be found online in the IFJ database.

The third set of figures indicates the yearly number of verdicts reached in trials for the killing of journalists. With only three exceptions these have all been for homicide. Some cases have taken six to seven years to reach court (e.g. the killings of Dmitry Kholodov and [[Igor Domnikov]]) but most deaths that have resulted in prosecution take, on average, 12–24 months between the killing and the verdict.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/incident:homicide/date:2006/impunity:trial |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110819033215/http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/incident%3Ahomicide/date%3A2006/impunity%3Atrial |dead-url=yes |archive-date=19 August 2011 |title=JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, An online database, "Trials for 2006 homicides" |publisher=Journalists-in-russia.org |accessdate=18 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/date:2007/impunity:trial |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726211930/http://journalists-in-russia.org/journalists/index/date%3A2007/impunity%3Atrial |dead-url=yes |archive-date=26 July 2011 |title=JOURNALISTS IN RUSSIA, An online database, "Trials for 2007 deaths" |publisher=Journalists-in-russia.org |accessdate=18 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Rates of conviction are a different matter. When the death was not related to the journalist's work the conviction rate exceeds 90%. When the journalist's death was certainly or seems likely to have been related to his or her work, the rate of acquittals rise sharply to around half of the total. Most trials are still held before a judge, aided by two lay assessors. Trial by judge and jury, which is still very rare in Russia, generally offers a more rigorous testing of evidence, robust defence of the suspects, and a higher chance of the defendant being found not guilty (average acquittal rate of 20%). The Politkovskaya murder trial, which was held before a jury, ended in February 2009 with the acquittal of all those accused.

If approximately three quarters of journalists's murders over the past 16 years were not related to their investigations and publications However, the CJES considers that up to 70% of assaults, which annually run into the dozens, are work-related. Sometimes these are very serious. In November 2008, Mikhail Beketov, chief editor of the ''Khimkinskaya pravda'', a paper in a Moscow suburb, was beaten so severely that although he survived, and his paper even resumed limited publication, by early 2010 he had still not regained the power of speech or independent movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/world/europe/18impunity.html?scp=2&amp;sq=levy&amp;st=nyt | title=It's Open Season on Journalists Near Moscow | first=Clifford J. | last=Levy | date=17 May 2010 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/05/18/world/europe/18interrogate.html?ref=europe | title=Beaten Russian Editor Is Told to Say It's His Fault | first=Clifford J. | last=Levy | date=17 May 2010 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; He died in 2013.

==Concern abroad==
Over the past decade the Russian authorities have been repeatedly urged by Western governments and international media bodies to do more to investigate the deaths of journalists. The Paris-based [[Reporters Without Borders]] frequently criticized Russia for what it described as a failure to investigate these murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=30218 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206135318/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=30218 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=6 February 2009 |title=Reporters Without Borders |publisher=Rsf.org |accessdate=18 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=18803 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060916072237/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=18803 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 September 2006 |title=Reporters Without Borders |publisher=Rsf.org |accessdate=18 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=round-up&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20070103093553/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=20286 "Three journalists were killed in Russia, making 21 since President Putin came to power in March 2000.

Between March 2000 and July 2007, Reporters Without Borders claimed 21 journalists were murdered in Russia because of their work.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20100310011747/http://www.rsf.org/After-Russia-awarded-2014-Winter.html "After Russia awarded 2014 Winter Olympics, authorities should demonstrate a real will to solve murders of journalists"], [[Reporters Without Borders]], 10 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar figures were produced by the CPJ.&lt;ref&gt;[http://cpj.org/Briefings/2005/russia_murders/russia_murders.html "Russia: Thirteen murders, no justice"], 2005 CPJ briefing. Retrieved 8 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; In a June 2007 statement, the CPJ said, "A total of 47 journalists have been killed in Russia since 1992, with the vast majority of killings unsolved,".&lt;ref name=cpj2/&gt; Seventeen of these journalists had been killed "in the line of duty" since 2000: 14 were murdered in retaliation for their journalism, "two died in crossfire; and one was killed while covering a dangerous assignment". The CPJ was continuing to investigate the deaths of eight other journalists to see if there was a link between their murder and their work. According to the CPJ, none of the 14 murders committed since 2000 had been solved and "13 bear the marks of contract hits".&lt;ref name=cpj2/&gt;

Pressure on the Russian authorities increased in late 2006 after the murder of Anna Politkovskaya. In June 2007, the board of the World Association of Newspapers passed a resolution, calling on the authorities in Russia to "investigate journalist deaths more vigorously":&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wan-press.org/print.php3?id_article=14269 "World's Press calls for Justice in Murder of Russian Journalists"], World Association of Newspapers press release, 5 June 2007, dateline: Cape Town, South Africa. Retrieved 8 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

:The brutal murder on 7 October 2006 of ''[[Novaya Gazeta]]'' journalist [[Anna Politkovskaya]], known for her critical reporting on the conflict in Chechnya in which she sought to expose human rights abuses, was yet another reminder to Russian journalists that violence awaits those who investigate or criticise. It is estimated that 21 journalists have been killed since Russian President Vladimir Putin came to power in March 2000. In the great majority of cases, no one has been convicted and sentenced for the murders.

On 18 June 2007, the U.S. House of Representatives passed House Resolution 151, calling on Putin to "step-up efforts to investigate" the murders.&lt;ref name=house&gt;[http://www.prnewswire.com/cgi-bin/stories.pl?ACCT=104&amp;STORY=/www/story/06-18-2007/0004610609&amp;EDATE= "House Passes Smith's Resolution Calling on Russia to Accept Outside Aid to Investigate Murders of Journalists", 2007] (access date 10 March 2008).&lt;/ref&gt; In a report published in 2007, the [[International News Safety Institute]] said more journalists had died violent deaths in Russia in the previous 10 years than anywhere in the world apart from Iraq,&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20111202205415/http://www.newssafety.org/images/pdf/KillingtheMessenger.pdf KILLING THE MESSENGER: The report on the global inquiry into the protection of journalists], International News Safety Institute, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; though it offered statistics rather than details of the individual victims.&lt;ref name=house/&gt; The British ''[[New Statesman]]'' magazine's website, which it described as "solidarity with the dead, and in association with [[Amnesty International]], [[Center for Journalism in Extreme Situations]], the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]], and [[Index on Censorship]]" published a list of 40 Russian journalists killed since 1993, representing only some of those who died.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071204131349/http://www.newstatesman.com/russian-journalists "Russian journalism's body count"], ''[[New Statesman]]'', undated.

== Legal outcomes==
Immediately after Politkovskaya's murder doubts were expressed about the chances of justice being done, even though the victim in this case was a journalist who had acquired a worldwide reputation (cf. [[Dmitry Kholodov]] in 1994). American commentator [[Anne Applebaum]] thought that the murderers of Politkovskaya would never be found.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.slate.com/id/2151209/ Anne Applebaum, "Anna Politkovskaya, 1958-2006: Russia's best-known journalist, murdered in Moscow"], ''Slate'' magazine, 9 October 2006. Retrieved 8 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; There were also some dissenting and sceptical voices.

Criticism from abroad was frequently perceived and rejected as selective. However, Russia's sought-for status as a member of [[G8]] from 1997 onwards set a benchmark that showed the continuing deaths of journalists, and of other media restrictions within the country, in an unfavourable light. Also of importance was the country's admission to the Council of Europe and, as a result, the potential involvement, after 1998, of the [[European Court of Human Rights]] as an arbiter of last resort. Unsuccessful attempts were made for the 2004 acquittal of Dmitry Kholodov's alleged killers to be examined in Strasbourg. So far the Court has only once determined the failure of the Russian authorities to pursue those responsible for the violent deaths of journalists. In 2005 it ruled that the October 1999 killing in Chechnya of cameramen Ramzan Mezhidov and Shamil Gigayev and of more than thirty other civilians who died during the same incident had not been properly investigated.&lt;ref&gt;A complaint was lodged with the Court in 2000 by the [[Memorial]] human rights organisation, on behalf of relatives of civilians who died alongside the two cameramen.

==Objective==
The Philippines' [[Department of Education (Philippines)|Department of Education]] decided to implement the program starting school year 2012. The Mother Tongue is primarily taught at kindergarten and grades 1, 2 and 3. The adoption of regional languages as medium of teaching is based on studies which tend to show that using the mother tongue as the language of instruction in the classroom literacy among [[Filipino people|Filipino]]s bolster comprehension and critical thinking skills of Filipino children in the school and facilitate learning of second language such as English and the Philippines' national language called [[Filipino language|Filipino]]. Filipino is Tagalog-based which means that speakers of Tagalog are speakers of the Philippine national language.

==Other languages==
There are approximately more than 175 languages and dialects in the Philippines which form part of the regional languages group. A few of these languages and dialects are spoken by in islands communities such as [[Abaknon language|Abaknon]] in [[Capul, Northern Samar|Capul]] island.

The '''Mahsud''' or '''Mehsud''' ({{lang-ps|محسود}}), also spelled '''Maseed''' ({{lang-ps|ماسيد}}), is a [[Karlani]] [[Pashtun people|Pashtun]]  tribe inhabiting mostly the [[South Waziristan]] Agency in [[Federally Administered Tribal Areas]] of [[Pakistan]]. A minor number of Maseed lineages are settled in the [[Logar Province]] of [[Afghanistan]], especially in [[Charkh District]], [[Baraki Barak]], and [[Muhammad Agha District|Muhammad Agha]], but also in [[Wardak Province|Wardak]], [[Ghazni Province|Ghazni]] and [[Kunduz Province|Kunduz]] Provinces. The Maseeds inhabit the center and north of [[South Waziristan]] valley, surrounded on three sides by the [[Darweshkhel]] [[Wazir (tribe)|Wazirs]], and being shut off by the [[Bettani]]s on the east from the [[Derajat]] and [[Bannu]] districts. The Mahsud speak the [[Waziristani dialect]] (Maseedwola) of [[Pashto]].

Two Pashtun tribes, the Ahmadzai Wazirs and the Maseeds, inhabit and dominate [[South Waziristan]]. Within the heart of Maseed territory in South Waziristan lies the influential [[Ormur]] (Burki) tribe's stronghold of [[Kaniguram]]. The Ormurs are considered by other tribes of South Waziristan to be close brethren of the Maseeds due to marital and other ties and the fact that the Ormurs have lived in and controlled Kaniguram for over a thousand years.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} There are also some Maseeds living in the [[UAE]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]].

The Maseeds  usually pronounce their name ''Māsīd''. They are divided into three great clans or subtribes, namely [[Alizai (Pashtun tribe)|Manzai]], [[Bahlolzai]], and [[Shamankhel]].  Maseeds usually call these ''Drei Māsīd'', meaning the "Three Maseeds"(DREZE). Each tribe has his own [[Khan (title)|Khan]]. In the words of Sir [[Olaf Caroe]], who acted as the former governor of the British Indian Frontier, "The Maseed tribe are a people who can never even think of submitting to a foreign power."  From 1860 to 1937, the English forces repeatedly attacked Maseed positions, but never got a foothold in the area.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

==History==
The Maseeds  originally lived in the centre of waziristan  area of [[FATA]]. In the later 14th century, they migrated eastwards, and fell into dispute with the [[Bannuchi]] and [[Khattak]] tribes settled in the Shawal area. The Maseeds and the Wazirs succeeded to defeat the Khattaks and pushed them northeastwards towards [[Bannu District|Bannu]] and Kohat. Eventually, the Mahsuds settled at the center of [[Waziristan]], in the [[Makeen]], [[Kaniguram]] and [[Ladha|Lada]] area.

During the British colonial period, the Maseeds were invaded several times by the [[British Empire]], in 1860, 1881, 1894-5, 1900-1, [[Waziristan campaign (1919–1920)|1919-20]] and in [[Pink's War|1925's Pink's War]].

==Primary locations==
The Maseed tribe inhabits a large portion of the center of Waziristan, which is drained by the Tank Zam and Shahur Rivers. The Maseed territory is a rough triangle between Jandola, the hills north of Razmak, and from Shuidar to Janimela, north of Wana. No portion of their territory touches the “settled” districts, and the tribe is surrounded on the north and west by the Wazirs, on the east by the Bhittanis, and on the south by the Wazirs and Shranis.

With the exception of a few Shabi Khel in the Bannu District, some land near Gumal in the Tank Tehsil, and the colonies at Chark and elsewhere in the Logar Valley in Afghanistan, none of the Maseed own land outside of South Waziristan Agency. To escape the severe cold in the higher hills during the winter, a large number move down to the lower valleys but always keep within the Maseed territorial limits. Many of these people live in caves or tents.

“South Waziristan is mountainous with several high peaks; Pirghal, for example, being 11,600 feet. The Gomal is the main river, in addition to which there are many hill torrents, which…remain dry for most of the year.”

The mountains and valleys geographically isolate the Maseed from large scale movements of invaders and provide excellent opportunities to conduct effective ambushes on enemies.

The cave villages along the Shahur River near Barwand and along the Split Toi provide excellent hiding places and defensive positions.

===Migratory patterns===
Many Maseed inhabit in the lower valleys during the winter. They return to family compounds at higher elevations during the summer.

==Key terrain features==
Valleys: Wacha Khwara, [[Ladha]], Baddar, Darra Algad, Khaisara, Mastang, Shaktu, Sheranna, Split Toi, Tak Zam

Plains: [[Razmak]]

Mountains: Kundeygaar, Pre Ghal, [[Safēd Kōh|Spin Ghar]], Spinkamar

Rivers: Tak Zam, [[Gomal River|Gomal]], Shahur, Shinkai Toi, Baddar Toi, Split Toi, Lower Khaisara Toi, Tauda China, Kundygar, Osspass, Karrama, Torwam, Thangi Parkhai

===Climate===
The climate in the region is hot in summer, with high temperatures around 110 degrees Fahrenheit, and cool in winter, with low temperatures around 35 degrees Fahrenheit. There is modest rainfall in July and August and in January and February.

==Recent history==
On many occasions the Afghan throne was saved with the help of the Maseed (like general Ramzan Khan Maseed Shamankhel, Shabaram Khan Machikhel, Bakhan Maseed, Mosa Khan Maseed, Miajee Maseed, Jagar Maseed etc.), Burki/Baraki, and Wazirs from Waziristan, Pakistan.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}} Of those who fought during this time, most came back to their homeland, but those who stayed were given high ranks of office, such as [[Faiz Muhammad Maseed]], who was appointed as an interior minister during the Reign of Daud Khan in the 1970s.
Today the majority of Maseeds are still in [[Logar Province]], with the title of Waziri, but by caste, they are Maseeds.  The majority of these are with a sub-caste of Malik Denai, Dramankel, Faridi, Shamirai شمیرائی, Shabi khel, etc. When the [[Soviet-Afghan War]] started, some of these families came back to Waziristan but could not stay there, so they moved to cities like [[Peshawar]] and [[Karachi]]. Some of them stayed in waziristan and D.I.Khan.  The Maseed helped to  defeat the British invading troops and saved Afghanistan, they contributed a lot because Afghanistan was nearly in the hands of British.
&lt;blockquote&gt;
[[John Ayde]] described the Maseeds:

They are poor but brave… and although turbulent and difficult to deal with, still have a great love of their country and cherish their independence, possessing qualities that we admire ourselves, and which deserve consideration and respect.

Maseed are very good marksmen and have the reputation of trustworthiness. Maseed is the most independent of all the tribes. Even their own maliks have a very limited control over them. However, Maseed have been increasingly integrated within Pakistani society since independence.

&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In 1850, Lewat's tribesmen the Great Baromi's (Shabi Khel) defeated 3,000 British troops with only 300 fighters, using guerrilla tactics by attacking the British in the [[Valley of Bobar]] (Waziristan) from all sides with outdated rifles and swords. This attack demoralized the British and made them fearful of the Maseeds. Survivors of this attack reported that the sight of the Maseed tribesmen charging at them (with loud roars and wearing long hair and beards like Lions) affected them mentally.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In 1860, three thousand Maseed tribesmen attacked the British regiment base in [[Tank (Pashtonkhwa)|Tank]] (present South Waziristan). The British struggled to defeat them.{{Citation needed|date=February 2008}}

In 1897, [[Mujahideen|Mujahed]] tribesmen again stood up against the British all the way from [[Quetta]] kakar, and the British experienced difficulty when engaging them. It was during this time that the name of [[Mullah Powindah]] [Jagar Draman Khil][Miajee] [Laly Malik Denai] [Mulla ShaSaleem kaka] emerged. ''Powindah'' comes from the [[Pashto language]], meaning "[[nomad]]".

Day after day, Mullah Powindah grew more popular and famous.and his right hand mulla shasaleem kaka machikhel popular of all wazir, Maseed trib. He emerged as a legendary figure among the people of the region and beyond. There was even a time the British considered him to be the sole leader of the Waziristan country. His followers would sporadically kill individual British officers.  However, the British were not able to capture the attackers, who would return to their mountain hideouts. All attempts to stop these attacks were unsuccessful.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In 1907, the Wazir and Maseed tribesmen were blocked from entry into any government-controlled territory. [[Economic sanctions]] were imposed, blocking even basic amenities, such as food and medicine. The British commander of that time blockaded the areas of [[Makin, Pakistan|Makin]] and Kaniguram. Various areas were searched to arrest Mullah Powindah without success. The British thought that the tribesmen were receiving weapons by sea, from the coast of [[Balochistan (region)|Balochistan]] and responded by creating check posts, but no weapons were confiscated.

Mullah Powindah died in 1913. It could be said that he was the crownless emperor of one of the most fiercesome of the Pashtun Tribes, the Maseeds. Upon his death, his son [[Shah Fazal Din]] was given leadership and his son-in-law, [[Mulla Abdul Hakeem kakar]], was appointed his adviser. They have good relations with Amir Abdul Rahman Khan, the Amir of Afghanistan.

When [[World War I]] started in 1915, the British were concerned that they would be engaged in battle on more than one front. This was a threat to their safety and economy, so they decided to close those fronts of lesser significance. They abandoned their ‘Forward Policy’ for the time being and sent a message of friendship and peace to the tribes. The tribes did not trust the British, and rejected these peace proposals. Instead, the Maseed assembled a militia to attack the British.

By this time, the British had established an air force in the subcontinent, which was used to harass the tribesmen, and as a result the tribe's hatred of the British increased. As a result of their suffering they were bent upon taking revenge, and hence their morale increased. A series of attacks were made by the Maseeds, inflicting heavy losses on the enemy. The attack on the [[Marhatta Regiment]] resulted in the deaths of hundreds of [[sepoy]]s and five British Officers. In the attack on the [[Punjab Regiment (Pakistan)|Punjab Regiment]], the Maseed warriors slaughtered everyone. The aerial bombardments had inflicted significant losses on the tribesmen, but they were content that they were also doing well and had killed around 250 of the enemy forces.

After the end of World War I, the British returned to Waziristan. This time, they built roads and forts throughout the land. The sophistication and constant patrols of the [[British Air Force]] helped create a secure atmosphere for their ground troops. With this sense of security, the British Army constructed a road from [[Jandola]] to [[Ladha]]. At [[Razmak]], they constructed a cantonment for their army officers and soldiers.

By 1922-23, all the British forces had moved from [[Wana, Pakistan|Wana]] to [[Razmak]]. They had constructed an airport there and instead of flying all the way from [[India]], their aircraft would fly from Razmak Airport and bomb the countryside. Because of this, the countryside of [[Makin, Pakistan|Makin]] was totally devastated. The Maseed deemed it appropriate at this time to agree to a ceasefire because this new British tactic was inflicting widespread losses on their side. The ceasefire, they imagined, would also enable them to devise a strategy for countering the latest British advances.

In 1925, the [[Royal Air Force]] successfully put down a Maseed rebellion by strafing the tribes' mountain strongholds.  The action, which came to be known as [[Pink's War]] led to the tribal leaders seeking peace terms.&lt;ref name="RAF"&gt;{{cite web

In 1927 Ghazi Ramadan Khan Mahsud attacked Wana camp with a huge lashkar (tribal militia).  The result was a big loss for the British army. In 1928 Ghazi Ramadan Khan Mahsud  re-assembled his lashkar again for his next attack, on Sararogha Fort. This time he attacked with a powerful force, killed all of the defending soldiers (numbering 300) and took hold of the Fort.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

===Lashkar invasion of Kashmir===
Immediately after Pakistan came into existence, Maseeds raised a tribal militia which entered [[Kashmir]] to help the newly created state [[Pakistan]] to capture [[Kashmir]]. They quickly reached [[Baramulla]] town, instead of pressing on to the capital, [[Srinagar]], to seize Kashmir completely.

A large number of tribals from Pakistan attacked Kashmir under the code name "Operation Gulmarg" to seize Kashmir. The invading tribals started moving along Rawalpindi-Murree-Muzaffarabad-Baramulla Road on 22 October 1947 with Muzaffarabad fell on 24 October 1947. They reached and captured Baramulla on 25 October.

'''Mail art''' (also known as '''postal art''' and '''correspondence art''') is a populist artistic movement centered on sending small scale works through the [[mail|postal service]].  It initially developed out of what eventually became [[Ray Johnson]]'s New York Correspondence School in the 1950s and the [[Fluxus]] movement in the 1960s, though it has since developed into a global movement that continues to the present.

==Characteristics==

Media commonly used in mail art include postcards, paper, a collage of found or recycled images and objects, rubber stamps, artist-created stamps (called [[artistamps]]), and paint, but can also include music, sound art, poetry, or anything that can be put in an envelope and sent via post.  Mail art is considered art once it is dispatched.  Mail artists regularly call for thematic or topical mail art for use in (often [[unjuried]]) exhibition.&lt;ref name=MOCA /&gt;&lt;ref name=UB&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art|url=http://digital.lib.buffalo.edu/cdm/landingpage/collection/LIB-PC001|work=Digital Collections, UB Libraries|publisher=University at Buffalo, The State University of New York|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mail artists appreciate interconnection with other artists.  The artform promotes an egalitarian way of creating that frequently circumvents official art distribution and approval systems such as the art market, museums, and galleries.  Mail artists rely on their alternative "outsider" network as the primary way of sharing their work, rather than being dependent on the ability to locate and secure exhibition space.&lt;ref name=Oberlin&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art @ Oberlin|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/|work=Oberlin College Art Library|publisher=Oberlin College &amp; Conservatory|accessdate=11 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403130316/http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/|archivedate=3 April 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="KostelanetzBrittain2001"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Richard Kostelanetz|author2=H.

Mail art can be seen as anticipating the cyber communities founded on the Internet.&lt;ref name=Spark /&gt;

==History==

[[File:RayJohnson invite1970.jpg|right|thumb|Ray Johnson's invitation to the first mail art show, 1970]]
Artist Edward M. Plunkett has argued that communication-as-art-form is an ancient tradition; he posits (tongue in cheek) that mail art began when Cleopatra had herself delivered to Julius Caesar in a rolled-up carpet.&lt;ref name=Plunkett&gt;{{cite journal|last=Plunkett|first=Edward M.|title=The New York Correspondence School|journal=Art Journal|year=1977|issue=Spring|url=http://www.artpool.hu/Ray/Publications/Plunkett.html|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ray Johnson, the New York Correspondance School, and Fluxus===
The American artist [[Ray Johnson]] is considered to be the first mail artist.&lt;ref name=MOCA&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art|url=http://www.moca.org/pc/viewArtTerm.php?id=22|work=Collection: MOCA's First Thirty Years|publisher=MOCA: The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Phillpot&gt;{{cite book|last=Phillpot|first=Clive|title=Eternal Network: A Mail Art Anthology|year=1995|publisher=University of Calgary Press|location=Canada|url=http://www.artpool.hu/Ray/Publications/Phillpot.html|editor=Chuck Welch|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Johnson's experiments with art in the mail began in 1943, while the posting of instructions and soliciting of activity from his recipients began in the mid-1950s with the mailing of his "moticos", and thus provided mail art with a blueprint for the free exchange of art via post.&lt;ref name=MOCA /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Francesco Vincitorio, "Informalista o videoartista? Le tendenze artistiche dagli anni '40 ad oggi", L'Espresso n.44, 7 November 1982{{full citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "mail art" was coined in the 1960s.&lt;ref name=Plunkett /&gt; In 1962, Plunkett coined the term "New York Correspondence School" to refer to Johnson's activities; Johnson adopted this moniker but sometimes intentionally misspelled it as "correspondance."&lt;ref name=Plunkett /&gt; The deliberate misspelling was characteristic of the playful spirit of the Correspondance School and its actions.&lt;ref name=Danto&gt;{{cite journal|last=Danto|first=Arthur C.|journal=The Nation|date=March 29, 1999|url=http://www.thenation.com/article/correspondance-school-art#|title=Correspondance School Art|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Correspondance School members are fairly obscure, and the letters they sent, often featuring simple drawings or stickers, often instructed the recipient to perform some fairly simple action. Johnson's work consists primarily of letters, often with the addition of doodles and rubber stamped messages, which he mailed to friends and acquaintances. The Correspondance School was a network of individuals who were artists by virtue of their willingness to play along and appreciate Johnson's sense of humor.  One example of the activities of the Correspondance School consisted in calling meetings of fan clubs, such as one devoted to the actress [[Anna May Wong]].  Many of Johnson's missives to his network featured a hand drawn version of what became a personal logo or alter-ego, a bunny head.&lt;ref name=Danto /&gt;

In a 1968 interview, Johnson explained that he found mailed correspondence interesting because of the limits it puts on the usual back and forth interaction and negotiation that comprises communication between individuals.  Correspondence is  "a way to convey a message or a kind of idea to someone which is not verbal; it is not a confrontation of two people. It's an object which is opened in privacy, probably, and the message is looked at&amp;nbsp;... You look at the object and, depending on your degree of interest, it very directly gets across to you what is there&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=AAAOH&gt;{{cite web|title=Oral history interview with Ray Johnson, 1968 Apr. 17|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/interviews/oral-history-interview-ray-johnson-13236|work=Archives of American Art|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1970, Johnson and Marcia Tucker organized The New York Correspondence School Exhibition at the [[Whitney Museum]] in New York, which was the first significant public exhibition of the mail art genre.&lt;ref name=MOCA /&gt;

On April 5, 1973, Johnson declared the "death" of the New York Correspondance School in an unpublished letter to the Obituary Department of ''The New York Times'' and in copies that he circulated to his network.   However, he continued to practice mail art even after this.&lt;ref name=AAALippardLetter&gt;{{cite web|title=Ray Johnson mail art to Lucy R. Lippard, 1965 June 29|url=http://www.aaa.si.edu/collections/images/detail/ray-johnson-mail-art-to-lucy-r-lippard-13544|work=Archives of American Art|publisher=Smithsonian Institution|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=RJEstate-bio&gt;{{cite web|title=Ray Johnson Biography|url=http://www.rayjohnsonestate.com/biography/|publisher=Ray Johnson Estate|accessdate=11 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although much of Johnson's work was initially given away, this hasn't prevented it from attaining a market value. [[Andy Warhol]] is quoted as saying he would pay ten dollars for anything by Johnson."&lt;ref&gt;Stewart Home, ''The Assault On Culture'', Aporia Press &amp; Unpopular Books, London 1988 {{full citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1973 diagram showing the development and scope of [[Fluxus]], [[George Maciunas]] included mail art among the activities pursued by the Fluxus artist [[Robert Filliou]].&lt;ref&gt;Hendricks, Jon (1988). ''Fluxus Codex'', New York: Harry N. Abrams, pp 329–333. {{ISBN|978-0-8109-0920-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filliou coined the term the "Eternal Network" that has become synonymous with mail art.&lt;ref name=Bloch&gt;{{cite book|last=Bloch|first=Mark|title=Amazing Letters: The Life and Art of David Zack|url=http://www.panmodern.com/zack-article.html|editor=Istvan Kantor|accessdate=11 April 2013|chapter=An Authentik and Historikal Discourse On the Phenomenon of David Zack, Mail Artist}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other Fluxus artists have been involved since the early 1960s in the creation of artist's postage stamps (Robert Watts, Stamp Dispenser, 1963), postcards (Ben Vautier, The Postman's Choice, 1965: a postcard with a different address on each side) and other works connected to the postal medium.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} "Indeed, the mail art network counts many Fluxus members among its earliest participants.  While Johnson did not consider himself directly as a member of the Fluxus school, his interests and attitudes were consistent with those of a number of Fluxus artists.&lt;ref name=Danto /&gt;&lt;ref name=AAAOH /&gt;

===1970s and 1980s===
In the 1970s, the practice of mail art grew considerably, providing a cheap and flexible channel of expression for cultural outsiders.  It was particularly widespread where state censorship prevented a free circulation of alternative ideas, as in certain countries behind the Iron Curtain or in South America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=John|title=East/West: Mail Art &amp; Censorship|journal=PostHype|year=1985|volume=4|issue=1|issn=0743-6025}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The growth of a sizable mail art community, with friendships born out of personal correspondence and, increasingly, mutual visits,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lloyd|first=Ginny|title=The Mail Art Community in Europe|journal=Umbrella Magazine|year=1981|volume=5|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; led in the 1980s to the organization of several festivals, meetings and conventions where networkers could meet, socialize, perform, exhibit and plan further collaborations.  Among these events were the Inter Dada Festivals organized in California in the early 1980s&lt;ref name=Ross&gt;{{cite news|last=Ross|first=Janice|title=A gleefully rebellious festival of dada|url=http://1.bp.blogspot.com/__IZN7YDU3d4/S_aip9CJ4WI/AAAAAAAAAmU/gS467sN7lZQ/s1600/reibunedada.jpg|accessdate=11 April 2013|newspaper=Oakland Tribune|date=August 26, 1984|location=Art: The Tribune Calendar}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Decentralized Mail Art Congress of 1986.&lt;ref name=HRFrickerOberlin&gt;{{cite web|title=Hans-Reudi Fricker|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/bios/fricker.html|work=Mail Art @ Oberlin|publisher=Oberlin College &amp; Conservatory|accessdate=11 April 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130903031741/http://www.oberlin.edu/library/art/mailart/bios/fricker.html|archivedate=3 September 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1984 curator Ronny Cohen organized an exhibition for the [[Franklin Furnace]], New York, called "Mail Art Then and Now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Mail Art From 1984 Franklin Furnace Exhibition|url=http://www.franklinfurnace.org/research/projects/flow/mailart/mailartf.html|publisher=Franklin Furnace|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was to have an historical aspect as well as showing new mail art, and to mediate the two aspects Cohen edited the material sent to Franklin Furnace, breaking an unwritten but commonly accepted custom that all works submitted must be shown. The intent to edit, interpreted as censorship, resulted in a two-part panel discussion sponsored by Artists Talk on Art (organized by mail artist Carlo Pittore and moderated by art critic [[Robert C. Morgan]]) in February of that year, where Cohen and the mail artists were to debate the issues.

The night preceding the second panel on February 24, [[Carlo Pittore]], John P. Jacob, Chuck Welch a.k.a. CrackerJack Kid, David Cole and John Held, Jr. crafted a statement asking Dr. Cohen to step down as the panel moderator. Welch delivered the statement whereby Dr. Cohen was asked to remain on the panel but forfeit her right to serve as moderator. Instead of remaining, Cohen chose to leave the event. After some give and take with both panelists and audience, Dr. Cohen left, saying, "Have fun boys." Her entourage walked out with her during the ensuing melee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=International MailArt--Part II: The New Cultural Strategy|last=Heisler|first=Faith|year=1984|issue=4|volume=9|page=18|journal=Women Artists News}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The excluded works were ultimately added to the exhibition by the staff of the Franklin Furnace, but the events surrounding it and the panels revealed ideological rifts within the mail art community. Simultaneously fanning the flames and documenting the extent to which it was already dominated by a small, mostly male, coterie of artists, the discussions were transcribed and published by panelist [[John P. Jacob]] in his short-lived mail art [[zine]] [[PostHype]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jacob|first=John|title=Mailart: A Partial Anatomy|journal=PostHype|year=1984|volume=3|issue=1|issn=0743-6025}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a letter to panelist [[Mark Bloch]], [[Ray Johnson]] (who was not a panelist) commented on the reverse-censorship and sexism of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Mark|first=Bloch|title=Ray Johnson's letter to me after the event, questioning the issue of sexism.|url=http://www.panmodern.com/ray-atoa-letter.jpg|publisher=panmodern.com|accessdate=25 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rise of mail art meetings and congresses during the late 80s, and the articulation of various "isms" proclaimed by their founders as movements within mail art, were in part a response to fractures made visible by the events surrounding the Franklin Furnace exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacob|first=John|title=The Coffee Table Book of Mail Art: The Intimate Letters of J.P. Jacob, 1981 - 1987|year=1987|publisher=Riding Beggar Press|location=New York|url=http://arcade.nyarc.org:80/record=b569546~S8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if "tourism" was proposed satirically as a new movement by H.R. Fricker, a Swiss mail artist who was one of the organizers of the 1986 Mail Art Congress, nevertheless mail art in its pure form would continue to function without the personal meeting between so-called networkers.&lt;ref name=HRFrickerOberlin /&gt;

In the mid-1980s, Fricker and Bloch, in a bilingual "Open Letter To Everybody in the Network" &lt;ref&gt;Bloch, Mark and Fricker, Hans Ruedi."Phantastische Gebete Revisited" in Panmag International Magazine 6, ISSN 0738-4777, February 1984. pg. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; stated, "1) An important function of he exhibitions and other group projects in the network is: to open channels to other human beings. 2) After your exhibition is shown and the documentation sent, or after you have received such a documentation with a list of addresses, ''use the channels''! 3) Create person-to-person correspondence... 4) You have your own unique energy which you can give to others through your work: visual audio, verbal, etc.  5) This energy is best used when it is exchanged for energy from another person with the same intentions. 6) the power of the network is in the quality of the direct correspondence, not the quantity." The manifesto concludes, "We have learned this from our own mistakes." &lt;ref&gt;Röder, Kornelia "H. R. Fricker, Mail Art and Social Networks," HR Fricker: Conquer the Living Rooms of the World, Kunstmuseum Thurgau, Warth, Switzerland: Edition Fink, 2014, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===1990s and the impact of the Internet era===
[[File:Paulo bruscky and david horvitz.JPG|thumb|American mail-artist [[David Horvitz]] (active since the 2000s) meets Brazilian mail artist Paulo Bruscky (active since the 1970s) in Berlin, Germany in November 2015.]]

In 1994, Dutch mail artist [[Ruud Janssen]] began a series of [[mail-interviews]] which became an influential contribution in the field of mail art.&lt;ref&gt;
Ruud Janssen, ''Mail-Interviews'', Tilburg 1994–2001
&lt;/ref&gt;

By the 1990s, mail art's peak in terms of global postal activities had been reached, and mail artists, aware of increasing postal rates, were beginning the gradual migration of collective art projects towards the web and new, cheaper forms of digital communication.&lt;ref&gt;[[Guy Bleus]] (Ed.), ''Re: The E-Mail-Art &amp; Internet-Art Manifesto'', in: ''E-Pêle-Mêle: Electronic Mail-Art Netzine'', Vol.III, n° 1, T.A.C.-42.292, Hasselt, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The Internet facilitated faster dissemination of mail art calls (invitations) and precipitated the involvement of a large number of newcomers.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} Mail art blogs and websites became ever more frequently used to display contributions and online documentation,{{original research inline|date=January 2013}} even if many{{who|date=January 2013}} mail artists still preferred the surprise of a catalogue found in their mailbox.{{original research inline|date=January 2013}}

==Philosophy and norms of the mail artist network==
In spite of the many links and similarities between historical avant-garde, alternative art practices ([[visual poetry]], [[Xerox art|copy art]], [[artist's book]]s) and mail art, one aspect that distinguishes the creative postal network from other artistic movements, schools or groups (including Fluxus) is the way it disregards and circumvents for the commercial art market.&lt;ref name=Spark&gt;{{cite web|title=About John Held Jr. in the Spark episode "The Fine Art of Collecting"|url=http://www.kqed.org/arts/programs/spark/profile.jsp?essid=4489|work=Spark|publisher=KQED|accessdate=11 April 2013|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Any person with access to a mailbox can participate in the postal network and exchange free artworks, and each mail artist is free to decide how and when to answer (or not answer) a piece of incoming mail. Participants are invited by network members to take part in collective projects or unjuried exhibitions in which entries are not selected or judged.  While contributions may be solicited around a particular theme, work to a required size, or sent in by a deadline, mail art generally operates within a spirit of "anything goes."&lt;ref name="Phillpot" /&gt;

The mail art philosophy of openness and inclusion is exemplified by the "rules" included in invitations (calls) to postal projects: a mail art show has no jury, no entry fee, there is no censorship, and all works are exhibited.&lt;ref name="Phillpot" /&gt; The original contributions are not to be returned and remain the property of the organizers, but a catalogue or documentation is sent free to all the participants in exchange for their works. Although these rules are sometimes stretched, they have generally held up for four decades, with only minor dissimilarities and adjustments, like the occasional requests to avoid works of explicit sexual nature, calls for projects with specific participants, or the recent trend to display digital documentation on blogs and websites instead of personally sending printed paper to contributors.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

[[File:BananaPost'89 AnnaBanana.jpg|right|thumb|BananaPost '89 artistamps by Anna Banana, 1989]]
Mail art has been exhibited in alternative spaces such as private apartments, municipal buildings, and shop windows, as well as in galleries and museums worldwide.&lt;ref name=Oberlin /&gt;   Mail art shows, periodicals, and projects represent the "public" side of postal networking, a practice that has at its core the direct and private interaction between the individual participants. Mail artists value the process of exchanging ideas and the sense of belonging to a global community that is able to maintain a peaceful collaboration beyond differences of language, religion and ideology; this is one aspect that differentiates the mail art network from the world of commercial picture postcards and of simply "mailed art."&lt;ref name="WelchAnthology"&gt;Welch, C. (1995). ''[http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/231651233 Eternal network: A mail art anthology]''. Calgary, Alta: Univ. of Calgary Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

A mail artist may have hundreds of correspondents from many different countries, or build a smaller core circle of favorite contacts. Mail art is widely practiced in Europe, North and South America, Russia, Australia and Japan, with smaller numbers of participants also in Africa, and China.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}  In addition to being kept by the recipient, mail art archives have attracted the interest of libraries, archives, museums, and private collectors.&lt;ref name=Spark /&gt;  Or, the works may be 'worked into' and recycled back to the sender or to another networker.

Ray Johnson suggested (with a pun) that "mail art has no history, only a present", and mail artists have followed his playful attitude in creating their own mythologies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/43915838|title=Ray Johnson : correspondences|last=M.|first=De Salvo, Donna|last2=Catherine.|first2=Gudis,|date=1999|publisher=Wexner Center for the Arts|year=|isbn=2080136631|location=|pages=81|oclc=43915838}}&lt;/ref&gt; Parody art movements like [[neoism]] and plagiarism have challenged notions of originality, as have the shared pseudonymous names [[Monty Cantsin]] and [[Karen Eliot]], which were proposed for serial use by anyone.&lt;ref name="Carr2012"&gt;{{cite book|author=C.

Various essays, graduate theses, guides and anthologies of mail art writings have appeared in print and on the Internet, often written by veteran networkers.&lt;ref name=WelchAnthology /&gt;
A sub-group of envelope art has its genesis in the Grateful Dead Ticket Service. Looking to help their fans avoid  the high fees that are generated by national ticket services the Grateful Dead started their own service, commonly referred to as mail order. At some point fans started decorating their envelopes with art. Some for art's sake, others to grab the attention of the people that dole out tickets in hope of better seats.http://www.gdtstoo.com/

==Media and artistic practices in the creation of mail artworks==
{{see also|Postage stamp}}
Because the democratic ethos of mail art is one of inclusion, both in terms of participants ('anyone who can afford the postage') and in the scope of art forms, a broad range of media are employed in creation of mail artworks. Certain materials and techniques are commonly used and frequently favored by mail artists due to their availability, convenience, and ability to produce copies.

===Rubberstamps and artistamps===
[[File:Rubberstamps Klafki Pawson(1980s).jpg|right|thumb|Mail art rubber stamps by Jo Klafki (left) and Mark Pawson (right), 1980s]]
Mail art has adopted and appropriated several of graphic forms already associated with the postal system. The rubber stamp officially used for franking mail, already utilized by [[Dada]] and Fluxus artists, has been embraced by mail artists who, in addition to reusing ready-made rubber stamps, have them professionally made to their own designs. They also carve into erasers with linocut tools to create handmade ones. These unofficial rubber stamps, whether disseminating mail artists' messages or simply announcing the identity of the sender, help to transform regular postcards into artworks and make envelopes an important part of the mail art experience.&lt;ref name=WelchAnthology /&gt;

Mail art has also appropriated the postage stamp as a format for individual expression. Inspired by the example of Cinderella stamps and Fluxus faux-stamps, the [[artistamp]] has spawned a vibrant sub-network of artists dedicated to creating and exchanging their own stamps and stamp sheets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bpost.be/site/fr/particuliers/timbres-poste/philat%C3%A9lie/timbres/2003/emission-sp%C3%A9ciale-09-du-19-mai |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-05-26 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150526171811/http://www.bpost.be/site/fr/particuliers/timbres-poste/philat%C3%A9lie/timbres/2003/emission-sp%C3%A9ciale-09-du-19-mai |archivedate=2015-05-26 |df= }} Belgian Postal Service, Guy Bleus &amp; Jean Spiroux, ''Journée du Timbre: Mail-Art'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Artist [[Jerry Dreva]] of the conceptual art group Les Petits Bonbons created a set of stamps and sent them to David Bowie who then used them as the inspiration for the cover of the single "Ashes to Ashes" released in 1980.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Griffin|first1=Roger|title=Scary Monsters|url=http://www.bowiegoldenyears.com/scarymonsters.html|website=Bowie Golden Years}}&lt;/ref&gt; Artistamps and rubber stamps, have become important staples of mail artworks, particularly in the enhancement of postcards and envelopes.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Frank, Peter, E.F. Higgins III, Rudolf Ungváry. "[http://www.artpool.hu/Artistamp/PFranke.html Postal Modernism: Artists' Stamps and Stamp Images]." ''World Art Post'', Artpool Archive, Museum of Fine Arts Budapest, April 1982 (pp.&amp;nbsp;1–4)&lt;/ref&gt; The most important anthology of rubberstamp art was published by the artist Hervé Fischer in his book ''Art and Marginal Communication'', Balland, Paris, 1974 - in French, English and German, to note also the catalog of the exhibition "Timbres d'artistes", Published of Musée de la Poste, Paris, 1993, organized by the french artist Jean-Noël Laszlo - in French, English.

===Envelopes===
Some mail artists lavish more attention on the envelopes than the contents within. Painted envelopes are one-of-a-kind artworks with the handwritten address becoming part of the work. Stitching, embossing and an array of drawing materials can all be found on postcards, envelopes and on the contents inside.&lt;ref name="WaPo" /&gt;

===Printing and copying===
Printing is suited to mail artists who distribute their work widely. Various printmaking techniques, in addition to rubber stamping, are used to create multiples. Copy art (xerography, photocopy) is a common practice, with both mono and color copying being extensively used within the network.&lt;ref name="UB" /&gt;  Ubiquitous 'add &amp; pass' sheets that are designed to be circulated through the network with each artist adding and copying, chain-letter fashion, have also received some unfavorable criticism.{{according to whom|date=January 2013}} However, Xerography has been a key technology in the creation of many short-run periodicals and [[zines]] about mail art, and for the printed documentation that has been the traditional project culmination sent to participants. Inkjet and laserprint computer printouts are also used, both to disseminate artwork and for reproducing zines and documentation, and PDF copies of paperless periodicals and unprinted documentation are circulated by email. Photography is widely used as an art form, to provide images for artistamps and rubber stamps, and within printed and digital magazines and documentation,&lt;ref name="WelchAnthology" /&gt; while some projects have focused on the intersection of mail art with the medium itself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Jacob|first=John|title=[[The International Portfolio of Artists Photography]]|year=1984|publisher=Riding Beggar Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lettering and language===
Lettering, whether handwritten or printed, is integral to mail art. The written word is used as a literary art form, as well as for personal letters and notes sent with artwork and recordings of the spoken word, both of poetry and prose, are also a part of the network.&lt;ref name="UB" /&gt; Although English has been the de facto language, because of the movement's inception in America, an increasing number of mail artists, and mail artist groups on the Internet, now communicate in Breton, French, Italian, German, Spanish, and Russian.{{citation needed|date=January 2013}}

===Other media===
In addition to appropriating the postage stamp model, mail artists have assimilated other design formats for printed artworks. Artists' books, decobooks and [[friendship book]]s, banknotes, stickers, tickets, artist trading cards (ATCs), badges, food packaging, diagrams and maps have all been used.

[[File:Kairan MAZine(2007).jpg|right|thumb|Cover of ''Kairan'' mail art zine, edited by Gianni Simone, aka Johnnyboy, 2007]]
Mail artists routinely mix media; [[collage]] and [[photomontage]] are popular, affording some mail art the stylistic qualities of [[pop art]] or Dada. Mail artists often use collage techniques to produce original postcards, envelopes and work that may be transformed using copy art techniques or computer software, then photocopied or printed out in limited editions.

[[Printed matter]] and [[ephemera]] are often circulated among mail artists, and after artistic treatment, these common items enter into the mail art network.&lt;ref name="UB" /&gt;  Small assemblages, sculptural forms or found objects of irregular shapes and sizes are parceled up or sent unwrapped to deliberately tease and test the efficiency of the postal service. Mailable fake fur ("Hairmail") and [[Astroturf]] postcards were circulated in the late 1990s.&lt;ref name="WaPo"&gt;{{cite news |

Having borrowed the notion of [[intermedia]] from Fluxus, mail artists are often active simultaneously in several different fields of expression. Music and [[sound art]] have long been celebrated aspects of mail art, at first using cassette tape, then on CD and as sound files sent via the Internet.&lt;ref name="CoxWarner2004"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Christoph Cox|author2=Daniel Warner|title=Audio Culture: Readings in Modern Music|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FgDgCOSHPysC&amp;pg=PA60|date=1 September 2004|publisher=Continuum|isbn=978-0-8264-1615-5|pages=60–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Performance art]] has also been a prominent facet, particularly since the advent of mail art meetings and congresses. Performances recorded on film or video are communicated via DVD and movie files over the internet. Video is also increasingly being employed to document mail art shows of all kinds.&lt;ref name=mailartforum&gt;{{cite web|title=The Techniques|url=http://www.mail-art.de/frame.php?dir=about:about_techniques&amp;doc=start.htm|work=Mail-Art:The Forum|accessdate=23 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Quotations==

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Correspondence art is an elusive art form, far more variegated by its very nature than, say, painting. Where a painting always involves paint and a support surface, correspondence art can appear as any one of dozens of media transmitted through the mail. While the vast majority of correspondence art or mail art activities take place in the mail, today's new forms of electronic communication blur the edges of that forum. In the 1960s, when correspondence art first began to blossom, most artists found the postal service to be the most readily available - and least expensive - medium of exchange. Today's micro-computers with modern facilities offer anyone computing and communicating power that two decades ago were available only to the largest institutions and corporations, and only a few decades previous weren't available to anyone at any price." - [[Ken Friedman]]&lt;ref name=FriedmanFlue&gt;{{cite journal|last=Friedman|first=Ken|title=Mail art history: the Fluxus factor|journal=FLUE - Special Issue: Mail Art|year=1984|volume=4|issue=3–4|editor1-first=Martha|editor1-last=Wilson|publisher=Franklin Furnace}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Cultural exchange is a radical act. It can create paradigms for the reverential sharing and preservation of the earth's water, soil, forests, plants and animals. The ethereal networker aesthetic calls for guiding that dream through action. Cooperation and participation, and the celebration of art as a birthing of life, vision, and spirit are first steps. The artists who meet each other in the Eternal Network have taken these steps. Their shared enterprise is a contribution to our common future." - [[Chuck Welch]]&lt;ref name="WelchAnthology" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The purpose of mail art, an activity shared by many artists throughout the world, is to establish an aesthetical communication between artists and common people in every corner of the globe, to divulge their work outside the structures of the art market and outside the traditional venues and institutions: a free communication in which words and signs, texts and colours act like instruments for a direct and immediate interaction." - Loredana Parmesani&lt;ref&gt;Loredana Parmesani, text under the entry "Poesia visiva", in ''L'arte del secolo - Movimenti, teorie, scuole e tendenze 1900–2000'', Giò Marconi - Skira, Milan 1997 {{full citation needed|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2524">'''Michael Harold Chapel''' is a former [[Gwinnett County, Georgia|Gwinnett County]] [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] [[police officer]], who was convicted in the murder of fifty-three-year-old Emogene Thompson outside a muffler shop on Peachtree Industrial Boulevard in [[Sugar Hill, Georgia]].

On the evening of April 15, 1993, Thompson was shot in the head while she was seated in her parked car.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.gwinnett-online.com/chapel/phil/overview.htm
&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://caselaw.findlaw.com/ga-supreme-court/1460116.html|title=Chapel v. The State. FindLaw's Supreme Court of Georgia case and opinions.|website=Findlaw|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The case was presided over by Judge Bishop. Verdicts in the case were returned from a jury on September 8, 1995 and September 10, 1995 of life imprisonment, instead of the death penalty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lawskills.com/case/ga/id/999/index.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2012-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150710051452/http://www.lawskills.com/case/ga/id/999/index.html |archivedate=2015-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Completely independent of both the prosecution, and a mandatory [[Patrolmen's Benevolent Association|Policemen's Benevolent Association (PBA)]] review of the accusations; Congressman [[James Traficant]] launched an investigation of his own into the charges against Chapel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.americanmafia.com/Feature_Articles_3.html|title=Christmas In Murdertown | first=J. R. |last=de Szigethy|website=www.americanmafia.com|accessdate=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Thompson, who lived in a trailer home with her son, reported to the Gwinnett County Police Department that about half of $14,000 in cash that was in her possession had been stolen. Chapel was the first to respond. He stated to her that because only part of the money was missing, that he suspected her son. Thompson told several friends that she was planning to meet with Chapel after he told her he wanted to compare serial numbers on the bills. Chapel is currently held in [[Long State Prison]]. 

The body of Thompson was discovered inside her car the following morning at a muffler shop on Peachtree Industrial Boulevard.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2342">The '''Dogra Muslim''' are a [[Muslim]] community found in Indian-administered [[Jammu and Kashmir]]. They are [[Muslim]] converts from the larger [[Hindu]] [[Dogra]] community. A large number of Dogra Muslim are also now found in the province of [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] in [[Pakistan]].  They are also known as Rajahs, especially in [[Pakistan]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Jammu and Kashmir Volume XXV edited by K.N Pandita, SDS Charak &amp; B. R Rizvi pages 302-308&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and origin==

The term Dogra Muslim is restricted to those who inhabit a small hilly tract known as the Duggar Des, comprising the districts of [[Kathua]], [[Jammu]] [[Samba]] and [[Udhampur]]. They are culturally distinct from the [[Pahari Rajput|Chibhali]] community that inhabit the western part of the [[Jammu]] administrative region. The community are mainly converts from the [[Dogra]] community, with the conversions having occurred during the period of [[Mughal Empire|Mughal]] rule. They belong mainly to the Thakkar, [[Rathore]], [[Minhas|Manhas]], [[Jarral]], Chib and Pal tribal groups. Many Dogra Muslim fled to [[Pakistan]] at the time of [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1947]]. They speak [[Dogri]] and [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]].&lt;ref&gt;People of India Jammu and Kashmir Volume XXV edited by K.N Pandita, SDS Charak &amp; B. R Rizvi pages 302-308&lt;/ref&gt;

==Present circumstances==

The Dogra Muslim inhabit a hilly terrain, and practice agriculture. They are endogamous, but unlike the [[Hindu]] [[Dogra]]s, do not practice clan exogamy. In their homeland, the Dogra Muslim inhabit their own villages, although there are some mixed settlements with the [[Gujjar]] and [[Bakarwal]], two neighbouring [[Muslim]] communities. Those Dogra Muslim who moved to [[Pakistan]] are settled mainly in [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]], inhabiting their villages, although there is shift towards adopting standard [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and [[Urdu language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;People of India Jammu and Kashmir Volume XXV edited by K.N Pandita, SDS Charak &amp; B.

'''New Year trees''' are decorated trees similar to [[Christmas tree]]s that are displayed to specifically celebrate the New Year. They should not be confused with the practice of leaving up a Christmas tree until after [[New Year's Day]]. New Year trees are common in various cultures and nations, chiefly the [[former Soviet Union]], [[Turkey]], [[China]] and [[Vietnam]].

==Russian and Turkish traditions==

[[Russia]]n and [[Turkish culture|Turkish]] New Year trees are of the same varieties as those used for Christmas trees, although a [[spruce]] tree is the most usual type. The decorations are the same as for Christmas trees. While Russian and Turkish North Americans purchasing a tree after Christmas when prices have plummeted might enjoy notable savings, most do not wait beyond Christmas to buy their trees.

===History of the Soviet New Year Tree===
[[File:Bezbozhnik u stanka - Run along, Lord, 1931, n. 22.jpg|thumb|250px|A 1931 edition of the Soviet magazine ''[[Bezbozhnik (magazine)|Bezbozhnik]]'', distributed by the [[League of Militant Atheists]], depicting an Orthodox Christian priest being forbidden to cut down a tree for Christmas]]
The tradition of installing and decorating a '''Ёлка''' (pr: '''Yolka''', tr: spruce tree) for [[Christmas]] dates back to the 17th century when [[Peter the Great]] imported the practice as a result of his travels in Europe. Peter decreed in 1699 that the New Year will be celebrated on January 1 instead of September 1, and that "Fir tree, pine and juniper branches and trees shall be used to decorate houses and gateways along main streets".&lt;ref&gt;[http://russiapedia.rt.com/on-this-day/december-20/ December, 20 in history]. russiapedia.rt.com (Accessed 24 January 2016)&lt;/ref&gt; However, in [[Imperial Russia]], ''Yolka'' were banned beginning in 1916 by the [[Synod]] as a tradition originating in Germany (Russia's enemy during [[World War I]]).

After the [[Russian Revolution|revolution of 1917]], Christmas celebrations—along with other religious holidays—were discouraged and de-facto prohibited as a result of the Soviet [[Anti-religious campaign during the Russian Civil War|antireligious campaign]].&lt;ref name="Connelly2000"&gt;{{cite book|last=Connelly|first=Mark|title=Christmas at the Movies: Images of Christmas in American, British and European Cinema|year=2000|publisher=I.B.Tauris|isbn=9781860643972|page=186|quote=A chapter on representations of ''Christmas'' in Soviet cinema could, in fact be the shortest in this collection: suffice it to say that there were, at least officially, no Christmas celebrations in the atheist socialist state after its foundation in 1917.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MIG"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://vz.ru/society/2005/11/29/14107.html Fir Markets]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[League of Militant Atheists]] encouraged school pupils to campaign against Christmas traditions, among them being the Christmas tree, as well as other Christian holidays, including [[Easter]]; the League established an antireligious holiday to be the 31st of each month as a replacement.&lt;ref name="Ramet2005"&gt;{{cite book|last=Ramet|first=Sabrina Petra|title=Religious Policy in the Soviet Union|date=10 November 2005|publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=9780521022309|page=138|quote=The League sallied forth to save the day from this putative religious revival. ''Antireligioznik'' obliged with so many articles that it devoted an entire section of its annual index for 1928 to anti-religious training in the schools. More such material followed in 1929, and a flood of it the next year. It recommended what Lenin and others earlier had explicitly condemned--carnivals, farces, and games to intimidate and purge the youth of religious belief. It suggested that pupils campaign against customs associated with Christmas (including Christmas trees) and Easter. Some schools, the League approvingly reported, staged an anti-religious day on the 31st of each month. Not teachers but the League's local set the programme for this special occasion.}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the Christmas tree being prohibited in accordance with [[Soviet anti-religious legislation]], people supplanted the former Christmas custom with New Year's trees.&lt;ref name="MIG"&gt;{{cite book|title=Echo of Islam|accessdate=23 November 2014|year=1993|publisher=MIG|quote=In the former Soviet Union, fir trees were usually put up to mark New Year's day, following a tradition established by the officially atheist state.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Dice2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dice|first=Elizabeth A.|title=Christmas and Hanukkah|year=2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9781438119717|page=44|quote=The Christmas tree, or Yolka, is another tradition that was banned during the Soviet era. To keep the custom alive, people decorated New Year's trees instead.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Year tree was encouraged in the USSR after the famous letter by [[Pavel Postyshev]], published in ''[[Pravda]]'' on 28 December 1935, in which he asked for trees to be installed in schools, children's homes, [[Young Pioneer Palace]]s, children's clubs, children's theaters and cinemas.&lt;ref&gt;{{ru icon}} [http://magazines.russ.ru/oz/2003/1/2003_01_28.html Legend of a man, who presented Soviet children with New Year's tree]&lt;/ref&gt; In his letter, Postyshev wrote:

{{quote|In the pre-revolutionary era the bourgeoisie and the capitalist officials always put up a tree for their children on New Year. Children of the working classes looked on with envy through the windows at the gleaming tree adorned with colored lights and the children of the rich playing around it. 
Why do our schools, orphanages, nurseries, children’s clubs, and Young Pioneer Palaces deprive children of the working class of the Soviet State of this wonderful enjoyment? Because some “left-leaning” exaggerators decried this pastime as a bourgeois children's indulgence.
It is time to put an end to this wrongful condemnation of the tree, which is a joyful diversion for the children. The Young Pioneer scout leaders are called upon to organize holiday celebrations for the children that feature New Year trees. In schools, orphanages, clubs, cinemas, and theaters – children’s New Year trees should be everywhere! There should not be a single village or community farm where the local board, along with members of the [[Komsomol|Young Communist League]], does not provide a New Year tree for their kids. City councils, chairmen of district executive committees, village councils, and education authorities must all work to bring the New Year tree to children of our great socialist motherland.
Our children will be grateful to us for giving them back the New Year tree.
I'm sure the [[Komsomol|Young Communists]] will take a very active part in this enterprise and do away with the silly misconception that the New Year tree is a bourgeois excess.
So, let's organize a New Year celebration for kids and arrange a good Soviet New Year tree in all our cities and rural villages!”&lt;ref&gt;Translation by Y. Ustinov&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1937, a [[Novy God|Novy God (New Year)]] Tree was also installed in the [[Moscow]] [[House of the Unions]]. An invitation to the Yolka at the Palace of Unions became a matter of honour for Soviet children.{{citation needed|date=December 2010}} After the [[dissolution of the USSR]], stigma against religion subsided amidst renewed public interest.

===History of the Turkish New Year tree===
[[File:New Year Tree in a Turkish home.JPG|thumb|right|New year decorations in a Turkish home]]
A Turkish New Year tree, in [[Turkish language|Turkish]] '''Yılbaşı Ağacı''', looks the same as a Christmas tree with Christmas ornaments. It is called a New Year tree because it is specific to the New Year and, with about 95% of Turkey's population [[Muslim]], most [[Turkish people|Turks]] do not celebrate Christmas.

After the modernisation of Turkey, the [[Islamic calendar]] and the [[fiscal calendar]] were replaced by the [[Gregorian calendar]] and New Year celebrations started in the late 1920s. The celebrations became popular in Turkey and Christmas trees were brought into the country as New Year trees. Since then, the custom of setting up a tree for the New Year is a traditional event in Turkey. It is usually put up between the beginning of December and the end of January, the mid date being New Year's Eve. Also, the habit of giving presents at Christmas was changed to the giving of New Year presents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.timeanddate.com/holidays/turkey/new-year-eve|title=New Year's Eve in Turkey|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The New Year tree can be considered an example of westernised [[Turkish culture]] or Turkified European culture.

==Vietnamese and Cantonese custom==
[[File:Hoa mai.jpg|thumb|upright|A small ''hoa mai'' tree decorated for Vietnamese [[Tết Nguyên Đán|Tết]]]]
[[File:PanYu Clifford Farm Tree New year plants.jpg|thumb|upright|Chinese New Year tree]]
Planting a New Year tree or '''cây nêu''' is also a Vietnamese custom that is part of the springtime [[Tết Nguyên Đán|Tết]] festival. Often a bamboo pole serves as the "tree".

''Hoa đào'' (in Northern) or ''[[Ochna integerrima|Hoa mai]]'' (in Southern) and [[kumquat]] trees are also decorated and displayed in Vietnamese homes during Tết.

In Cantonese, the new year tree is called ''Nin Fa'' ({{zh|t=年花}}, literally New Year Flower). Bamboo is just one of the new year trees for the Cantonese, the others being mandarin and peach. The mandarin plant is called ''Kat'' ({{zh|t=桔}}), which is a  homophone to {{zh|t=吉}}, standing for good luck. The peach flower stands for good relationships; love is one of the relationships, so it's also a wish for love.

'''Pincus Green''' (born 1934) is an [[United States|American]] oil and gas [[commodities]] trader.

==Biography==
Green was born to an [[Orthodox Jewish]] family,&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2001/feb/25/opinion/op-29978 Los Angeles Times: "Pardon Reignites Jewish Stereotypes" by WALTER REICH] February 25, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fortune1986&gt;[http://fortune.com/2011/05/22/the-lifestyle-of-rich-the-infamous-fortune-classics-1986/ Fortune Magazine: "The Lifestyle of Rich, the Infamous (Fortune Classics, 1986)" by Shawn Tully] May 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DailyNewsPlayer&gt;[http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/news/rich-partner-major-player-minor-key-article-1.908010 New York Daily News: "Rich Partner A Major Player in Minor Key" by William Sherman] March 18, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jta.org/2009/10/05/fundermentalist/at-least-139-of-the-forbes-400-are-jewish Jewish Telegraph Agency: "At least 139 of the Forbes 400 are Jewish" By Jacob Berkman] October 5, 2009&lt;/ref&gt; the seventh of eight children, and raised in [[Flatbush, Brooklyn]].&lt;ref name=DailyNewsPlayer /&gt; His father was a distributor of confectionery.&lt;ref name=DailyNewsPlayer /&gt; As a youth, Green attended Jewish parochial schools but dropped out of high school to support his family when he was 16.&lt;ref name=DailyNewsPlayer /&gt; In 1953, at the age of 17, he got a job working the mailroom at the commodity trading firm, [[Philipp Brothers]].&lt;ref name=DailyNewsPlayer /&gt;  In 1954, Philipps hired [[Marc Rich]] in the mailroom and they soon became friends.&lt;ref name=DailyNewsPlayer /&gt; Both quickly advanced in the company and eventually became top traders in Europe especially in oil trading,&lt;ref name=DailyNewsPlayer /&gt; Rich in Spain and Green in the Phillips' office in Zug.&lt;ref name=Fortune1986 /&gt; In 1974, they left Philipp Brothers to form their own company, Marc Rich AG,&lt;ref name=DailyNewsPlayer /&gt; headquartered in [[Zug]], [[Switzerland]].&lt;ref name=Fortune1986&gt;[http://fortune.com/2011/05/22/the-lifestyle-of-rich-the-infamous-fortune-classics-1986/ Fortune Magazine: "The Lifestyle of Rich, the Infamous (Fortune Classics, 1986)" by Shawn Tully] May 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Green fled the [[United States]] in 1983, along with partner [[Marc Rich]],&lt;ref name="Forbes 400 2005"/&gt; after being indicted by [[U.S. Attorney]] and future [[mayor of New York City]] [[Rudolph Giuliani]], on charges of [[tax evasion]] and illegal trading with [[Iran]] but in fact, it was legal because their company Rich and Co. was Swiss based company .&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.counterpunch.org/2016/10/03/the-pardon-of-arc-rich-how-hillary-clinton-served-as-the-secret-weapon-for-one-of-the-biggest-tax-cheats-in-american-history/ Article at www.counterpunch.org 3 October 2016] accessed 30 January 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Fortune1986 /&gt; Soon after fleeing, they sold the U.S. affiliate of Marc Rich AG (renamed Clarendon Ltd) to Alec Hackel, a partner to Green and Rich. U.S. legal authorities determined that the sale was false and froze the assets of the company, which hurt Marc Rich AG's .&lt;ref name=Fortune1986 /&gt;  In 1984, Clarendon paid the U.S. government $150 million to settle tax charges and Marc Rich AG's trading volume recovered.&lt;ref name=Fortune1986 /&gt; The three partners divided their responsibilities with Rich trading oil, Hackel trading metals and minerals, and Green, responsible for shipping, finance, and administration.&lt;ref name=Fortune1986 /&gt;

Though Canada's [[List of countries and dependencies by population density|population density]] is low, many regions in the south such as [[Southern Ontario]], have population densities higher than several [[European countries]]. Canada's [[List_of_the_100_largest_population_centres_in_Canada#Lists|largest population centres]] are [[Toronto]], [[Montreal]], [[Vancouver]], [[Calgary]], [[Edmonton]] and [[Ottawa]] with those six being the only ones with more than one million people. The large size of Canada's north which is not [[Arable land|arable]], and thus cannot support large human populations, significantly lowers the [[carrying capacity]]. Therefore, the population density of the habitable land in Canada can be modest to high depending on the region.

The historical growth of Canada's population is complex and has been influenced in many different ways, such as indigenous populations, expansion of territory, and human migration.

The '''[[Race (classification of human beings)|racial classification]] of [[Indian American]]s''' has varied over the years and across institutions.&lt;ref name="Harpalani"&gt;Harpalani, Vinay, DesiCrit: Theorizing the Racial Ambiguity of South Asian Americans (August 12, 2013). 69 NYU Annual Survey of American Law 77 (2013); Chicago-Kent College of Law Research Paper No. 2013-30. pp. 123, 124 &amp; 136.

==Initial perceptions==
The earliest Indian immigrants into the United States were called "Hindoos" even though the majority of them were [[Sikh]]s.&lt;!--This is on the second to fourth line of the first paragraph of page 123 of Harpalani (2013).--&gt; Court clerks classified these early immigrants from the [[Punjab region]] as being "white", "brown" or "black" based on their skin color for the purpose of marriage licenses.&lt;!--This is in the fourth to seventh lines of the first paragraph of page 124 of Harpalani (2013).--&gt; In addition to being [[Racialization|racialized]] by their color, they were also racialized as being "[[Ingroups and outgroups|foreigners]]".&lt;!--This is in the third line of the second paragraph of page 124 of Harpalani (2013).--&gt;&lt;ref name="Harpalani" /&gt; The perception of Indian Americans as foreigners, on the other hand, often helped provide for better treatment, especially in states where [[de jure]] segregation was in place. Regardless of their skin color, as "foreign internationals," Indians most often used 'White-Only' facilities, a privilege which they would not have been granted otherwise. As opposed to being seen as "negro," or "brown," they were seen as outside of the traditional American racial spectrum, and consequently freed from some of the encumbrances that system entailed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=New York Times|title=Negro Pastor Traveled in the South in Turban|url=http://i.imgur.com/GhmDWUk.jpg|accessdate=17 March 2016|agency=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Clerk|first1=Cecil|title=AskHistorians: How were Asians and Indians treated during times of racial segregation?|url=https://redd.it/2wrimw|website=Reddit|publisher=Reddit}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Desai|first1=Manan|title=The 'Tan Stranger' from Ceylon|url=https://www.saada.org/tides/article/20140708-3618|website=South Asian American Digital Archive|publisher=SAADA|accessdate=17 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==U.S. courts==
Throughout much of the 20th century, U.S. courts classified Indians as both [[white people|"White"]] and "non-White". Each ruling was for individuals from different ethnic and racial groups of the subcontinent, reflecting the variability in the resulting decisions. In 1909, [[Bhicaji Balsara]] became the first Indian to gain U.S. citizenship, as a [[Parsi]] he was ruled to be "the purest of Aryan type" and "as distinct from Hindus as are the English who dwell in India”. Almost thirty years later, the same Circuit Court to accept Balsara ruled that [[Rustom Dadabhoy Wadia]], another Parsi also from [[Bombay]] was not white and thefore not eligible to receive U.S. citizenship.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Postmodernism &amp; a Sociology...(c)|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CnMon2RiFLAC&amp;pg=PA143|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|isbn=978-1-61075-322-7|pages=143–}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1923, the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] decided in ''[[United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind]]'' that while Indians were [[Caucasian race|Caucasians]] and that anthropologists considered them to be of the same race as [[white people|"White"]] Americans, people of Indian descent were not "White" men, and thus not eligible to citizenship.&lt;ref name=Thind&gt;United States v. Bhagat Singh Thind, Certificate From The Circuit Court Of Appeals for the Ninth Circuit., No. 202. Argued 11, 12 January 1923.—Decided 19 February 1923, United States Reports, v. 261, The Supreme Court, October Term, 1922, 204–215.&lt;/ref&gt; The court conceded that, while Thind was a high caste [[Hindu]] born in the northern [[Punjab region]] and classified by certain scientific authorities as of the Aryan race, he was not "White" since the word Aryan "has to do with linguistic and not necessarily with physical characteristics" and since "the average man knows perfectly well that there are unmistakable and profound differences" between Indians and white Americans. The court also clarified that the decision did not reflect or imply anything related to racial superiority or inferiority, but merely an observable difference.&lt;ref name=Thind2&gt;{{cite web|title=Not All Caucasians Are White: The Supreme Court Rejects Citizenship for Asian Indians|url=http://historymatters.gmu.edu/d/5076/|publisher=History Matters|accessdate=20 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, this decision retroactively stripped Indians of citizenship and land rights. The ruling also placated the [[Asiatic Exclusion League]] demands, spurned by growing outrage at the [[Turban Tide and Hindoo Invasion (sic)|Turban Tide / Hindoo Invasion (sic)]] alongside the pre-existing outrage at the [[Yellow Peril]]. As they became classified as non-whites, Indian Americans were banned by [[anti-miscegenation laws]] from marrying white Americans in the states of Arizona, Virginia, South Carolina and Georgia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lovingday.org/map.htm Loving Day: Celebrate the Legalization of Interracial Couples&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1935, Thind relied on his status as a veteran of the United States military during World War I to petition for naturalization through the State of New York under the Nye-Lea Act, which made World War I veterans eligible for naturalization regardless of race. The government objected his latest petition, but Thind was finally granted American citizenship; Yet the Government attempted to revoke it after nearly two decades from his first petition for naturalization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Coulson|first1=Doug|title=British Imperialism, the Indian Independence Movement, and the Racial Eligibility Provisions of the Naturalization Act: United States v. Thind Revisited|journal=Georgetown Journal of Law &amp; Modern Critical Race Perspectives|date=2015|issue=7|pages=1–42|ssrn=2610266}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, Congress, beginning to recognize that India would soon be independent, passed a new law that allowed Indians to become citizens and also established an immigration quota for the same.&lt;ref name="Thind2"/&gt;

==U.S. Census==
{{further information|Race and ethnicity in the United States Census}}

The [[United States Census|U.S. Census Bureau]] has changed over the years its own classification of Indians. In the 1930 and 1940 censuses, "Hindu" was listed as a racial category.&lt;!--The source said that "Hindu" appeared as a category on the 1930 census, and it disappeared on the 1950 census.

===Self-identification===
Since 1980, owing to the diverse nature of South Asians, Indians and other South Asians have been classified according to self-reporting.&lt;ref name="census.gov"/&gt; In the 1990 US Census, 65% of [[Second-generation immigrants in the United States|second generation]] South Asian Americans identified themselves using a South Asian term, 25% identified themselves as White and 5% identified themselves as Black.&lt;!--This is in the first paragraph of page 76.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Morning" /&gt; In recent years, an increasing number of Indians are identified as [[white people|"White"]] due to increasing immigration from the North-West of the Indian subcontinent, which is home to [[Caucasian race|Caucasian]] ethnic groups within the country.&lt;ref name="Morning" /&gt; [[Nikki Haley]], the Indian American governor of South Carolina, whose parents are from Punjab in North-West India, identified as [[white people|White]] on her voter registration card in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.motherjones.com/mojo/2011/07/indian-nikki-haley-says-she-is-white%20 "Indian Nikki Haley Says She Is White"]. ''Mother Jones''. July 29, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

Both South Asian Americans and other types of Asian Americans mutually feel that there exists "profound racial difference" between themselves and the other group.&lt;!--This is in the sixth to eighth lines of the second paragraph of page 64.--&gt; Furthermore, "Working-class or state school-educated second generation Indian Americans do not see a natural alliance or unity with other Asian American groups."&lt;!--This is found in the block quote on page 75 of Morning (2001).--&gt;&lt;ref name="Morning" /&gt;

The 1990 U.S. Census classified write-in responses of "[[Aryan]]" as white even though write-in responses of "[[Indo-Aryans|Indo-Aryan]]" were counted as Asian, and the 1990 US Census classified write-in responses of "''[[Parsi people|Parsi]]''" under [[Iranian American]], who are classified as White along with [[Arab Americans]] and other Middle Eastern Americans.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20050313073045/http://www.lib.umich.edu/govdocs/cicdoc/cen90app/ancestry.htm University of Michigan. Census 1990: Ancestry Codes.] at the [[Wayback Machine]] (archived March 13, 2005)&lt;/ref&gt;

Some [[Indian American]]s who were unfamiliar with the [[ethnonym]]ic conventions used in the United States, mistakenly indicated that they were "[[Native American name controversy|American Indian]]" as their race in the 1990 US Census, because they were unaware that this term is used in the United States to refer to [[Native Americans in the United States|Native Americans]].&lt;!--This is in note 12 of page 77.--&gt;&lt;ref name="Morning" /&gt;

The Asian American Institute proposed that the 2000 US Census make a new ''Middle Easterner'' racial category and the Punjabi from Pakistan wanted Pakistani Americans to be included in it.&lt;ref&gt;Menon, Sridevi.

==USATF controversy==
Hersh's name became the center of controversy in 2014 when the delegates to the USATF National Convention voted overwhelmingly (392 to 70) to retain Hersh as the American representative to the IAAF Council, only to have the Board of Directors reverse that decision in their meeting as the delegates were on their way home, voting 11-1 to select USATF President [[Stephanie Hightower]] to replace Hersh.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://trackandfieldnews.com/discussion/showthread.php?144666-USATF-BOD-Ousts-IAAF-Senior-VP-Bob-Hersh-In-Favor-Of-Hightower |title=USATF BOD Ousts IAAF Senior VP Bob Hersh In Favor Of Hightower |website=TrackAndFieldNews.com |date=December 6, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.usatf.org/News/USATF-Board-selects-IAAF-candidates.aspx |title=USATF Board selects IAAF candidates |publisher=USA Track &amp; Field |date=December 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ocregister.com/articles/hightower-645155-iaaf-board.html |title=Reid: Track's Hightower should step up and step aside |work=The Orange County Register |date=December 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Athlete [[Lauren Fleshman]] said Hightower should step aside, while [[David Torrence (athlete)|David Torrence]] said "It doesn't make sense."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.letsrun.com/news/2014/12/lauren-fleshman-david-torrence-irate-twitter-bob-hersh-stephanie-hightower-usatf-election/ |title=Lauren Fleshman And David Torrence Irate On Twitter Over Bob Hersh / Stephanie Hightower USATF Election |publisher=LetsRun.com |date=December 5, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Torrence later switched his affiliation to running for Peru before his untimely death in 2017.

[[File:Thomas Munro classic.jpg|thumb|250px|Statue of Thomas Munro in [[The Island, Chennai]]]]
The '''statue of Thomas Munro''' is an [[Equestrianism|equestrian]] [[statue]] of [[Thomas Munro, 1st Baronet]], Scottish army commander and [[Governor of Madras]] from 1820 to 1827, located in the city of [[Chennai]], [[India]]. The [[bronze]] statue sculpted by [[Francis Chantrey]] in the [[United Kingdom]] in 1834 and shipped to Madras in 1839, is one of the popular landmarks in Chennai. The absence of [[stirrups]] is one of the peculiarities of the statue and for this reason, it is also referred to as '''"The Stirrupless Majesty"'''.

Thomas Munro was one of the most popular British administrators in [[South India]].

== Death of Thomas Munro ==
Munro's term as Governor of Madras came to an end in 1826. As there was a delay in appointing a new Governor, Munro decided to visit the [[Ceded Districts]] of the Madras Presidency, where he had served as a settlement officer in the early 19th century, in the meantime.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw"&gt;{{cite book|title=Sir Thomas Munro and the British settlement of the Madras presidency|first=John|last=Bradshaw|year=1893|publisher=Oxford University Press|place=London|pages=210–212}}&lt;/ref&gt; As he was riding through the hills of [[Cuddapah District]] along with a mixed retinue of Europeans and Indians, Munro observed a golden, thread-like glow across two hills.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw" /&gt; He remarked

{{quote|What a beautiful garland of flowers they have stretched across the valley!&lt;ref name="Bradshaw" /&gt;}}

His followers were perplexed as the garland was not visible to anyone. At length, an old Indian in the retinue reportedly replied, with sorrow:

{{quote|Alas! a great and good man will soon die!&lt;ref name="Bradshaw" /&gt;}}

After spending a few days at [[Anantapur, Andhra Pradesh|Ananthapur]], Thomas Munro and his party reached [[Gooty]] on 4 July 1827.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw" /&gt; At Gooty, some of his men were afflicted with [[cholera]].&lt;ref name="Bradshaw" /&gt; Two days later, at [[Pattikonda]], Munro caught cholera from his men and had to be nursed.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw" /&gt; His condition deteriorated in the evening and he died at half-past-nine on 6 July 1827.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw" /&gt;

Munro was buried at a [[graveyard]] in Gooty.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw" /&gt; In April 1831, his remains were transported to Madras and interred in the St. Mary's Church, [[Fort St. George]].&lt;ref name="Bradshaw" /&gt;

When the news of Munro's death reached Madras, it was mourned by all classes of people in the city. The government issued a Gazette Extraordinary on 9 July 1827 with the message:

{{quote|His sound and vigorous understanding, his transcendent talents, his indefatigable application, his varied stores of knowledge, his attainments as an Oriental scholar, his intimate acquaintance with the habits and feelings of native soldiers and inhabitants generally, his patience, temper and facility of access, and kindness of manner would have ensured him distinction in any line of employment. These qualities were admirably adapted to the duties which he had to perform in organizing the resources, and establishing the tranquility of those provinces where his latest breath has been drawn, and where he has long been known with the appellation of the ''Father'' of the People&lt;ref name="Bradshaw" /&gt;}}

A public meeting was soon held in his memory in Madras city in which was made a proposal to erect a statue to Munro through public subscription.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw" /&gt; The Madras government opened a memorial for Munro in the town of [[Pattikonda]] where he had died.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw" /&gt; A [[choultry]] called "Munro Choultry" was erected in [[Gooty]] in his honour.&lt;ref name="Bradshaw" /&gt;

A total of nine thousand pounds (£8000, according to some sources&lt;ref name="fraser"&gt;{{cite journal|title= Fraser's magazine|volume=27|first1=Thomas|last1=Carlyle|editors=James Anthony Froude, John Tulloch|pages=676–677|year=1843|publisher=J.

The statue depicts Thomas Munro riding a horse. In doing so, Chantrey had opted to follow, for commemorative purposes, the prevalent Western practice of portraying authority.&lt;ref name="britishsculpturerajp83" /&gt; It is believed that Chantrey might have modelled the statue upon his own earlier work of [[George IV]] at [[Trafalgar Square]], [[London]].&lt;ref name="britishsculpturerajp83" /&gt; This might have been intended to elevate Munro above the Indians whose cause he championed.&lt;ref name="britishsculpturerajp83" /&gt; Chantrey was, initially, caught in a dilemma over the choice of [[riding animal|steed]].&lt;ref name="jonesp8788"&gt;[[#Jones|Jones]], pp 87-88&lt;/ref&gt; While some of his friends and visitors suggested a classic horse, some suggested an Arabian, others a war horse.&lt;ref name="jonesp8788" /&gt; Eventually, Chantrey chose an Arab, similar to the one he had sculpted for his statue of George IV.&lt;ref name="londoncuriositiesp758"&gt;{{cite book|title=Curiosities of London: exhibiting the most rare and remarkable objects of interest in the metropolis, with nearly sixty years' personal recollections|first=John|last=Timbs|publisher=J.

The combined height of the horse and the rider is more than 15 feet.&lt;ref name="gentlemansmagazinep405"&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Gentleman's magazine|place=London|year=1838|volume=163|publisher=F.

Captain Hervey has been credited with popularizing an anecdote connected with Munro's statue

{{quote|... I was one day driving by the monument when I saw an old man in a red coat, with three chevrons on his right arm. standing leaning on his staff, and gazing silently on the exalted statue. He was evidently an old pensioner, not only from his dress, but from a certain degree of military carriage in his ''tout ensemble'', which there was no mistaking. Out of curiosity I stopped my buggy, got out, and addressed the veteran. "What are you looking at, my fine old fellow?", enquired I. "Do you know who that is intended to represent?" "Who can have known the great Sir Thomas Munro?", replied the old man, "without remembering him? And who can have known him without loving him? And how can I, who had served under him for many years, ever forget him?"

"Then you think that is a good likeness of our Governor-you recognize the face?" asked I.

"Yes sir", said he. "It is a good likeness, but we shall never again see any like him. He was indeed the friend of the Indian, whether a sepoy or a ryot at the plough. And Madras will never again
have a Governor like him." And raising his hand to the head, he gave the old-fashioned salute, lifted up his bundle and walked off, mumbling to himself about the impropriety of crows being allowed to build nests on the top, and to dirt over the head of the greatest man of his age.&lt;ref name="calcuttareviewp272"&gt;{{cite journal|work=The Calcutta review|volume=14|title=Recent Military Memoirs|page=272|year=1850|publisher=[[University of Calcutta]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Proposed removal ==
During the [[World Classical Tamil Conference 2010 | World Classical Tamil Conference]] held in [[Coimbatore]] in 2010, there were demands to remove the statue of Thomas Munro, evoking strong protests from conservationists.&lt;ref name="thehindu_20100726" /&gt;&lt;ref name="thehindu_20100621"&gt;{{cite news|title=Replace Munroe statue with Rajaraja I, says BJP|work=The Hindu|date=21 June 2010|url=http://www.hindu.com/2010/06/21/stories/2010062161060400.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though the government had arrived at a decision to remove the statue, it has not yet been implemented.&lt;ref name="thehindu_20100726" /&gt;

'''''The Malay Dilemma''''' is a book written by [[Mahathir bin Mohamad]] in 1970, 11 years before he became [[Prime Minister of Malaysia|Malaysia's 4th Prime Minister]].

== History ==
At the time of publication, Mahathir had just lost his parliamentary seat, been expelled from the ruling party [[UMNO]] and [[Malaysia]] had recently been rocked by the [[ethnic conflict|racial riots]] later known as the [[13 May Incident]]. The book analyses [[Malaysian history]] and [[Politics of Malaysia|politics]] in terms of [[racism]], and posits the following basic positions:

* The [[Malay race]] are the [[indigenous people]] (''[[bumiputra]]s'') of Malaysia.
* The sole national language is the [[Malay language]] and all other races are to learn it.
* The [[Toleration|tolerant]] and non-confrontational nature of the Malays has allowed them to be subjugated in their own land by the other races with the collusion of the [[British Empire|British]].
* A program of [[affirmative action]] is required to correct [[Malaysian Chinese]] [[hegemony]] in business.

The dilemma thus, was whether Malays should accept this governmental aid—and Mahathir's position was that they should.

Prone to sweeping statements about other races, such as describing [[Jews]] as "hook-nosed",&lt;ref name=jews /&gt; the book entrenched Mahathir's image as a Malay ''[[Ultra (Malaysia)|ultra]]'' (chauvinist). However, Mahathir also dissects the multiple failings of his own race, and the book was intended as a solution leading ''away'' from violence towards a harmonious, [[Racial integration|integrated]] Malaysia (albeit one where [[political]] and [[economic]] power is firmly concentrated in the hands of the Malays).

Mahathir was readmitted to UMNO in 1972 and became the Prime Minister in 1981, and in time most of the policies suggested in the book were indeed adopted by the Malaysian government, most notably in the [[Malaysian New Economic Policy]].  The dilemma was revisited in 2000 to 2002 by Mahathir and his successor [[Abdullah Ahmad Badawi]], who now argued that Malays were well on the way to catching up, and that they should now be weaned away from the "[[Malaysian New Economic Policy|crutches]]" that had allowed them to compete.{{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

== Criticism ==
In the preface of the book's first edition, its British publisher casts doubt on the accuracy of Mahathir's assumptions and facts. Mahathir has been criticised for the lack of documentary evidence to buttress his many arguments and conclusions. Bakri Musa states that his assertions and assumptions were based on his personal observations and experiences, with no empirical data to support them.&lt;ref name=bakri /&gt;

The '''Udmurts''' ({{lang-udm|Удмуртъёс}}, ''Udmurt’jos'') are a people who speak the [[Udmurt language]]. In the course of history, [[Russian language|Russian]]-speakers have referred to them as ''{{transl|ru|Chud Otyatskaya}}'' ({{lang|ru|чудь отяцкая}}), '''Otyaks''', '''Wotyaks''' or '''Votyaks''' (the most-known{{citation needed|date=October 2013}} name). [[Tatar language|Tatar]]-speakers call the Udmurts ''{{lang|tt|Ar}}''.{{cn|date=July 2017}}

==Etymology==
The name ''Udmurt'' comes from *''odo-mort'' 'meadow people,' where the first part represents the [[Permic]] root *''od''(''o'') 'meadow, glade, turf, greenery', and the second part ''murt'' means 'person' (cf. [[Komi language|Komi]] ''mort'', [[Mari language|Mari]] ''mari''), probably an early borrowing from an [[Iranian languages|Iranian language]] (such as [[Scythian languages|Scythian]]): *''mertä'' or *''martiya'' 'person, man' (cf. Urdu/Persian ''mard''), which is thought to have been borrowed from the [[Indo-Aryan languages|Indo-Aryan]] term *''maryá-'' 'man', literally 'mortal, one who is bound to die' (&lt; [[Proto-Indo-European|PIE]] *''[[:en:wikt:Appendix:Proto-Indo-European/mer-|mer-]]'' 'to die'), compare [[Old Indic]] ''márya'' ‘young warrior’ and Old Indic ''marut'' ‘chariot warrior’, both connected specifically with horses and chariots.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher I. Beckwith. Empires of the Silk Road: A History of Central Eurasia from the Bronze Age to the Present. Princeton: Princeton University Press. 2009. Page 397.&lt;/ref&gt; This is supported by a document dated 1557, in which the Udmurts are referred to as ''lugovye lyudi'' 'meadow people', alongside the traditional Russian name ''otyaki''.&lt;ref&gt;A.G. Ivanov, "Udmurty – 'Lugovye lyudi'", ''Linguistica Uralica'' Vol. 27, No. 3 (1991), pp. 188–92.&lt;/ref&gt; 

On the other hand, in the Russian tradition, the name 'meadow people' refers to the inhabitants of the left bank of river in general. Recently, the most relevant is the version of [[Vladimir Napolskikh|V. V. Napolskikh]] and S. K. Belykh. They suppose that ethnonym was borrowed from the Iranian entirely: *''anta-marta'' 'resident of outskirts, border zone' (cf. ''[[Antes people|Antes]]'') → Proto-[[Permic]] *''odə-mort'' → [[Udmurt language|Udmurt]] ''udmurt''.&lt;ref&gt;Белых С. К., Напольских В. В.

==Distribution==
Most Udmurt people live in [[Udmurtia]]. Small groups live in the neighboring areas of [[Kirov Oblast]] and [[Perm Krai]] of [[Russia]], [[Bashkortostan]], [[Tatarstan]], and [[Mari El]].

The Udmurt population is shrinking; the Russian Census reported 552,299 in 2010, down from the [[Russian Census (2002)|2002 Russian census]] figure of 637,000, in turn down from 746,562 in 1989.

The [[Udmurt language]] belongs to the [[Uralic languages|Uralic]] family; the Udmurts are therefore considered to be a branch of the [[Finno-Ugric peoples]].

The Udmurts have a national epic called ''[[Dorvyzhy]]''. Their national musical instruments include the ''[[krez (instrument)|krez]]'' zither (similar to the Russian ''[[gusli]]'') and a pipe-like [[wind instrument]] called the ''chipchirghan''.&lt;ref name="Michka1994"&gt;{{cite book|author=Vitaly Michka|title=Inside the New Russia|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_IMrAQAAMAAJ|accessdate=17 June 2012|date=1 October 1994|publisher=SC Publishing|isbn=978-1-885024-17-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Wakashū''' ([[Japanese language|Japanese]]: {{lang|ja|若衆}}, "young person", although never used for girls) is a historical Japanese term indicating an adolescent boy; more specifically, a boy between the ages at which his head was partially shaven (''maegami'') (about 5–10 years of age), at which point a boy exited early childhood and could begin formal education, [[apprenticeship]], or employment outside the home, and the ''[[genpuku]]'' coming of age ceremony (mid-teens through early 20s), which marked the transition to adulthood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pflugfelder|first=Gregory M.|title=Cartographies of desire: male-male sexuality in Japanese discourse, 1600–1950|publisher=University of California Press|year=1999|pages=33|isbn=0-520-20909-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leupp|first=Gary P.|title=Male Colors: The Construction of Homosexuality in Tokugawa Japan|publisher=University of California Press|year=1997|pages=125|isbn=0-520-20900-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this period, the ''wakashū'' wore a distinctive hairstyle, with a small shaved portion at the crown of the head and long forelocks at front and sides, and typically wore [[kimono]] with open sleeves (''wakiake''); boys from wealthier families could wear ''[[furisode]]''. After the coming of age ceremony, the forelocks were shaved off, giving the adult male hairstyle (''[[chonmage]]''), and the boy assumed the adult male style of kimono with rounded sleeves. Although any person would be clearly classified as a child, ''wakashū'' or adult, the timing of both boundaries of the ''wakashū'' period were relatively flexible, giving families and patrons the ability to accommodate the development and circumstances of the individual boy.

The concept of ''wakashū'' contained several partially overlapping elements: an age category between childhood and adulthood; the social role of a pre-adult or adolescent boy, usually conceived of as a subordinate (student, apprentice or protégé); and the idea of the "beautiful youth", a suitable target for homosexual desire and the subject of ''[[Homosexuality in Japan#Ancient and medieval Japan|wakashūdo]]'', "the way of youths". As boys were considered eligible for homosexual liaisons only when they were ''wakashū'', their patrons occasionally delayed their coming of age ceremony beyond socially acceptable limits, leading to legal efforts in 1685 to require all ''wakashū'' to undergo their coming of age ceremony by age 25.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leupp|first=Gary P.|title=Male Colors: The Construction of Homosexuality in Tokugawa Japan|publisher=University of California Press|year=1997|pages=34, note 24|isbn=0-520-20900-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Note furisode sleeves worn by both. [[Suzuki Harunobu]], [[nishiki-e|polychrome woodblock print]], c. 1770]]

In the [[Meiji era]], the term became obsolete; the first meanings were replaced by the new term ''[[shōnen]]'', and the last by the related construction ''[[bishōnen]]'' ("beautiful boy").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pflugfelder|first=Gregory M.|title=Cartographies of desire: male-male sexuality in Japanese discourse, 1600–1950|publisher=University of California Press|year=1999|pages=221–234|isbn=0-520-20909-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
In [[kabuki]] theatre ''wakashū'' (or ''wakashū-gata'') referred to actors specializing in adolescent male roles (and who were usually ''wakashū'' themselves).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Leupp|first=Gary P.|title=Male Colors: The Construction of Homosexuality in Tokugawa Japan|publisher=University of California Press|year=1997|page=90|isbn=0-520-20900-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Wakashū'' often also performed as ''[[onnagata]]'' ("woman-role"; female impersonators).

The '''Wari'''', also known as the '''Pakaa Nova''', are an [[indigenous people of Brazil]], living in seven villages in the [[Amazon rainforest]] in the state of [[Rondônia]].&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt; Their first contact with European settlers was on the shores of the [[Pakaa Nova River]], a tributary of the [[Mamoré River]]. Many of them live within the [[Sagarana Indigenous Territory]].&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

==Name==
Europeans at one time used the name "Pakaa Nova" to refer to the Wari', because they encountered the indigenous people near there. The people prefer to be referred to as "Wari'", their term in their language meaning  "we, people."&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; They are also known as the Jaru, Oro Wari, Pacaas-Novos, Pacahanovo, Pakaanova, Pakaanovas, Uari, and Uomo.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt;

==Language==
The Wari' speak the [[Pakaásnovos language]], which belongs to the [[Txapakura languages|Txapakura]],&lt;ref name=intro/&gt; or [[Chapacura-Wanham language]] family. Parts of the Bible were translated into their language from 1975 to 1984.&lt;ref name=ethno/&gt;

==Population and locations==
Along with the [[Torá]], the [[More language|Moré]] (or [[Itenes]]) and the [[Oro Win]], the Wari' are the last of the [[Txapakura language]] linguistic group. Other groups were exterminated by Europeans or neo-Brazilians. 

Up until the 19th century, the Wari' were present in the Amazon's Southeast, namely the basin of the Lage river (a right-bank-tributary river of the [[Mamoré River]]), the Ouro Preto river, the Gruta and Santo André creeks, the Negro river (all tributaries of the lower and middle courses of the right bank of the Pakaa Nova river), and the [[Ribeirão River|Ribeirão]] and Novo rivers (tributaries of the left bank of the Pakaa Nova river).

In the early 20th century, continuous incursions by neo-Brazilians in search of rubber trees forced the Wari' to relocate to the less accessible headwaters of the [[Mamoré River]]. They were confined in that area until the pacification. Today, they live in seven settlements located in the state of Rondônia, Brazil.&lt;ref name=intro/&gt;

==Denomination and ethnicity==
The tribe is divided into subgroups, but no word exists to define an individual that belongs to a different group, and the term usually applied is ''tatirim'' (stranger).  A person from the same subgroup is referred to as "win ma" (land fellow).

Today, the Wari' subgroups are:
{{div col}}
*OroNao
*OroEo
*OroAt
*OroMon
*OroWaram
*OroWaramXijein
{{div col end}}

Some individuals still identify themselves with two other subgroups that no longer exist, the OroJowin, or the OroKaoOroWaji.  Oro is a collectivizing particle that can be translated as "people" or "group".

==Relations between subgroups==
Present relations between subgroups are still influenced by the dynamics that existed before the pacification (see below).  Each subgroup is intimately connected to a territory, a set of areas that are all identified by name, with each inhabited by a "local group".

The frontiers between territories are fluid. An area associated with one subgroup can be incorporated into the territory of another subgroup if it is occupied by a local group that belongs to another subgroup. That is made possible by the [[nomad|semi-nomadic]] characteristic of the people (see below).

Membership to any given subgroup is not defined by fixed rules. Children may be considered members of either parent's subgroup, or of the subgroup associated with the territory in which they were born.  Cultural or subgroup identities are part of one's birthright, but socially constructed during a lifetime through relations with one's relatives and neighbors. The Wari' recognize that individuals have multiple identities based on their specific relations and experiences.

==Society==
Every subgroup is organized around a set of brothers, each of whom is often married to women who are sisters. [[Polygyny]], especially sororal polygyny, is the basis of Wari' family structure. Any village is made up of nuclear families and a separate house, called "the men's house." It  serves as a dormitory for single adolescents and as a meeting place for adult men. A couple usually varies their place of residence, shifting between the woman's parents' and the man's parents', although no specific rule determines when the shift is made. 

The Wari' are semi-nomadic, moving their villages at least once every five years. They stay away from floodplains but closer to the shores of small perennial rivers.

A maize [[swidden]], providing the staple crop, is developed around the village. Finding the ideal earth for corn growing (black earth or [[terra preta]]) plays a key role in determining where to set up a village. The importance of agricultural land is also reflected in the language, since a person from the same subgroup is called a "land fellow".

==Cannibalism==
The Wari formerly practiced [[endocannibalism]], specifically mortuary cannibalism. This was done as a form of utmost respect to those who had died.&lt;ref name=cannibal&gt;[http://pib.socioambiental.org/en/povo/wari/865 "Wari': Funerary Cannibalism."] ''Povos Indígenas no Brasil.'' Retrieved 22 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Conklin1995"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Conklin|first1=Beth A.|title=“thus are our bodies, thus was our custom”: mortuary cannibalism in an Amazonian society|journal=American Ethnologist|volume=22|issue=1|year=1995|pages=75–101|issn=00940496|doi=10.1525/ae.1995.22.1.02a00040}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Right after death, the closest relatives would hug and embrace the deceased person. The body would be left for about three days, although there was no set span, and depended largely on how soon family members in other settlements could get to the funeral.&lt;ref name=conklin&gt;Conklin (2001).&lt;/ref&gt; By this time, the body typically had begun to [[Decomposition|decompose]] in the heat and humidity of the Amazon, sometimes reaching the stage where the body became [[Putrefaction|bloated and discolored]].&lt;ref name=conklin/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conklin1995"/&gt;  When all relatives within reasonable distance had arrived, they respectfully prepared the body. 

Mortuary preparation involved ritual wailing and other ceremonies, building a fire, removing the [[viscera|visceral organs]], and finally roasting the body.&lt;ref name="Conklin1995"/&gt; The decedent's closest kin would not consume the body, but they urged the attendant relatives to eat. Consumption of the flesh would assuage the family's grief, as it meant the soul of the person was being kept in the living body of relatives, rather than being abandoned to wander the forest alone. The practice was considered an act of compassion and affinal love, as much as a gesture of grief.&lt;ref name=conklin/&gt;&lt;ref name="Conklin1995"/&gt; The relatives were encouraged to eat what they could, but this sometimes amounted to little more than small tokens of the spoiled meat.&lt;ref name="Conklin1995"/&gt; Even this consumption often caused the mourners great [[vomiting|gastric distress]].&lt;ref name=conklin/&gt; The heart and liver were eaten, but much of the body and hair was burned.&lt;ref name=cannibal/&gt;

Today, Wari' do not practice any form of cannibalism.&lt;ref name="Conklin1995"/&gt; They bury their dead after two or three days of mourning.&lt;ref name=cannibal/&gt;

==Warfare==
Currently, the Wari' are peaceful, but before the pacification they warred with neighboring tribes. Their most notable victories occurred over the [[Karipuna people|Karipuna]], a [[Tupi people|Tupi]] ethnicity, and the [[Uru-Eu-Wau-Wau]]. With contact with the Brazilian government in the 20th century, the focus of their warfare shifted and they lost contact with the old ''wijam'' (enemy).

The Wari' consider enemies as "former Wari'" who have distanced themselves to the point of severing cultural exchanges.  In spite of that, a Wari' warrior did not distinguish between an enemy and an animal, thus felt no need to be merciful or gracious to an enemy any more than he would an animal.  

Once the battles were over, the Wari' warriors would bring home the bodies of the fallen enemies whenever possible. Those bodies would be served to the women and younger men who had stayed home, to strengthen the group.  

The battle warriors retreated to the men's house, where they stayed in quarantine. During this period they moved around as little as possible, staying in their hammocks for most of the day and drinking only [[chicha]]. The purpose was to "keep the enemy's blood within the warrior's body", thus giving him strength. [[Sexual intercourse|Sex]] was  prohibited, as they thought the blood of the enemy would "turn into semen" and thus allow the enemy's strength to be passed on to the tribesmen's children. The warrior was not allowed to partake of the fallen enemies, because it was believed that he had kept the enemy's blood within himself, and such an act would be self-cannibalism, resulting in his death. Children were prohibited from eating dead enemies.  The quarantine ended when the women refused to continue preparing the chicha.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}
