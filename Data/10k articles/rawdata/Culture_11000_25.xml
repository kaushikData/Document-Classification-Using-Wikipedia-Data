'''Academic writing''' is conducted in several sets of forms and [[genre]]s, normally in an impersonal and dispassionate tone, targeted for a critical and informed audience, based on closely investigated [[knowledge]], and intended to reinforce or challenge concepts or arguments. It usually circulates within the academic world ('the academy'), but the academic writer may also find an audience outside via journalism, speeches, pamphlets, etc.
Typically, scholarly [[writing]] has an objective stance, clearly states the significance of the topic, and is organized with adequate detail so that other scholars may try to replicate the results.  Strong papers are not overly general and correctly utilize formal academic rhetoric.

This article provides a short summary of the full spectrum of critical and [[Academia|academic]] writing and lists the genres of academic writing. It does cover the variety of [[critic]]al approaches that can be applied when one writes about a subject. However, as Harwood and Hadley (2004) and Hyland (2004) have pointed out, the amount of variation that exists between different disciplines may mean that we cannot refer to a single academic literacy.&lt;ref name="catterall"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/269872663_Developing_Writing_Skills_for_International_Students_Adopting_a_critical_pragmatic_approach|title=Developing Writing Skills for International Students: Adopting a critical pragmatic approach|author1=Stephen Catterall|author2= Christopher Ireland|date=October 2010|website=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While academic writing consists of a number of text types and genres, what they have in common, the conventions that academic writers traditionally follow, has been a subject of debate.&lt;ref name=catterall/&gt; Many writers have called for conventions to be challenged, for example Pennycook (1997) and Ivanic (1998), while others suggest that some conventions should be maintained, for example Clark (1997, p136).&lt;ref name=catterall/&gt;

==Discourse community==
A discourse community is essentially a group of people that shares mutual interests and beliefs. "It establishes limits and regularities...who may speak, what may be spoken, and how it is to be said; in addition [rules] prescribe what is true and false, what is reasonable and what foolish, and what is meant and what not." (Porter, 39).
People are generally involved in a variety of discourse communities within their private, social, and professional lives. Some discourse communities are very formal with well established boundaries, while others may have a more loose construction with greater freedom. Additionally, discourse communities have approved channels of communication in which members write or speak through. These channels can be a web page, a journal, a blog, or any other medium people use to communicate through. Examples of discourse communities may include but certainly not limited to:
* [[Medicine]]
* [[Economics]] (theory and applied)
* [[Law]]
* [[Psychology]]
* [[Movie|Films]] (Movies)
* General Forums
* [[Technology]]
* [[Sociology]]
* [[Philosophy]]
* [[Chemistry]]
* [[Physics]]
* [[Mathematics]]
* [[Writing]]
* [[Rhetoric]] and [[Composition (language)|Composition]]

The concept of a discourse community is vital to academic writers across nearly all disciplines, for the academic writer's purpose is to influence a discourse community to think differently. At the same time the discourse community does not expect to see any writing that appears too foreign. For this reason the academic writer must follow the constraints (see article section below) set by the discourse community so his or her ideas earn approval and respect.

===Discourse community constraints===

Constraints are the discourse community's written and unwritten conventions about what a writer can say and how he or she can say it. They define what is an acceptable argument. Each discourse community expects to see a writer construct his or her argument using their conventional style of language and vocabulary, and they expect a writer to use the established [[intertext]] within the discourse community as the building blocks for his or her argument.

===Writing for a discourse community===

In order for a writer to become familiar with some of the constraints of the discourse community they are writing for, a useful tool for the academic writer is to analyze prior work from the discourse community. The writer should look at the textual 'moves' in these papers, focusing on how they are constructed. Across most discourses communities, writers will:
* Identify the novelty of their position
* Make a claim, or thesis
* Acknowledge prior work and situate their claim in a disciplinary context
* Offer warrants for one's view based on community-specific arguments and procedures (Hyland)

Each of the 'moves' listed above are constructed differently depending on the discourse community the writer is in. For example, the way a claim is made in a high school paper would look very different from the way a claim is made in a college composition class. It is important for the academic writer to familiarize himself or herself with the conventions of the discourse community by reading and analyzing other works, so that the writer is best able to communicate his or her ideas. (Porter) Contrary to some beliefs, this is by no means plagiarism.

Writers should also be aware of other ways in which the discourse community shapes their writing. Other functions of the discourse community include determining what makes a novel argument and what a 'fact' is. The following sections elaborate on these functions.

===Misconceptions regarding facts and opinions in the discourse community===

It is important for any writer to distinguish between what is accepted as 'fact' and what is accepted as 'opinion'. Wikipedia's article Fact misguides writers in their interpretation of what a fact actually is. The article states that "A fact (derived from the Latin factum, see below) is something that has really occurred or is actually the case". But this is not how writers think of facts. Writing professionals hold that, "In a rhetorical argument, a fact is a claim that an audience will accept as being true without requiring proof".&lt;ref name="Wardle2011"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wardle|first=Elizabeth|first2=Douglas|last2=Downs|title=Writing about Writing|year=2011|publisher=Bedford/St. Martin's|isbn=0-312-53493-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|76}} Facts can be thought of merely as claims. The audience can be thought of as a discourse community, and a fact can suddenly change to become an opinion if stated in a different discourse community. This is how writers within discourse communities manage to present new ideas to their communities. Any new opinion would need to be proven by making a rhetorical argument, in which the writer would weave together what his or her intended audience will accept as 'facts' in a way that supports his or her idea. Therefore, knowing the intended discourse community is a very important part of writing.

Across discourse communities, what is considered factual may fluctuate across each community. As Elizabeth Wardle and Douglas Downs wrote in their book ''Writing about Writing'',&lt;ref name="Wardle2011" /&gt;{{rp|67}} in reference to Margaret Kantz's article "Helping students use textual sources persuasively":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kantz|first=Margaret|title=Helping students use textual sources persuasively|journal=College English|year=1990|volume=52|issue=1|pages=74–91|url=http://writing.colostate.edu/files/classes/3512/File11970-Mar-10-2008-12-22-41-PM.pdf|accessdate=18 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quotation | A key concept in this change is learning to recognize that facts aren't so much inherently true statements as they are claims-that is, assertions that most of a given audience has agreed are true because for that audience sufficient proof has already been given. You, like most people, would probably classify the statement "the Earth is round" as a "fact." Its status as a fact, however, depends on our mutual agreement that "round" is an adequate description of the Earth's actual, imperfectly spherical shape. What Kantz wants us to see is that what makes the statement a fact is not how "true" the statement is but that most people have agreed that it's true and treat it as true. Statements about which we haven't reached this consensus remain claims, statements that people argue about. Kantz's work here demonstrates why it's so important to read texts-even "factual" works like textbooks and encyclopedias-as consisting of claims, not facts.}}

===Misconceptions regarding making a novel argument===

Within discourse communities, writers build on top of the ideas established by previous writers. One of the most common misconceptions about writing is the idea of the 'lonely writer'; that great writers' papers are filled almost entirely with original ideas and messages. But this is simply not the case. Discourse communities introduce new ideas and claims, and from these, writers expand on them. James Porter, a [[scholar]] of Rhetoric at Indiana University, uses The Declaration of Independence as an example to illustrate this point. Porter points out that Jefferson merely pulled the phrase "That all men are created equal" straight from his commonplace book he made as a boy. Porter also points out that, "'Life, Liberty, and the pursuit of Happiness'" was a cliche of the times, appearing in numerous political documents." In fact, according to Porter, almost nothing in the Declaration of Independence was written originally by Jefferson. Jefferson wrote this great work by weaving together the intertext of his discourse community. As Greene describes in his article, "Argument as Conversation", academic writing can be thought of metaphorically as a conversation between those in the discourse community. "The metaphor of conversation emphasizes the social nature of writing" (Greene). Just like in a conversation when you listen to the ideas of the others who are involved and formulate your own opinion on the topic, a writer may be reading a paper done by another writer in the discourse community and from this paper, the scholar may obtain inspiration to expand the claims expressed in the paper or address them from other angles. "Like the verbal conversations you have with others,' effective arguments never take place in a vacuum; they take into account previous conversations that have taken place about the subject under discussion" (Greene). Good academic writers know the importance of researching previous work from within the discourse community and using this work to build their own claims. By taking these ideas and expanding upon them or applying them in a new way, a writer is able to make their novel argument.

==Intertextuality==

'''Intertextuality''' is the combining of past writings into original, new pieces of text. The term intertextuality was coined in 1966 by [[Julia Kristeva]]. All texts are necessarily related to prior texts through a network of links, writers (often unwittingly) make use of what has previously been written and thus some degree of borrowing is inevitable. This generally occurs within a specific discourse community.

===Conversation===
Factoring in intertextuality, the goal of academic writing is not simply creating new ideas, but to offer a new perspective and link between already established ideas. This is why gathering background information and having past knowledge is so important in academic writing. A common metaphor used to describe academic writing is "entering the conversation", a conversation that began long before you got there and will continue long after you leave. A quote from Kenneth Burke encapsulates this metaphor:

{{quotation | "Imagine that you enter a parlor. You come late. When you arrive, others have long preceded you, and they are engaged in a heated discussion, a discussion too heated for them to pause and tell you exactly what it is about. In fact the discussion had already begun long before any of them got there, so that no one present is qualified to retrace for you all the steps that had gone before. You listen for a while, until you decide that you have caught the tenor of the argument; then you put in your oar. Someone answers; you answer him; another comes to your defense; another aligns himself against you, to either the embarrassment or gratification of your opponent, depending on the quality of your ally's assistance. However, the discussion is interminable. The hour grows late, you must depart, with the discussion still vigorously in progress."}}

Intertextuality plays into this because without it there would be no conversations, just hundreds of thousands of writings not connected or able to build on each other.  The listening until you can join the conversation can be seen as doing research. All of the research you read, is built on research instead of self-knowledge. This can be connected to the part of the metaphor where no one in the parlor is qualified to bring you up to speed, just as the papers your researched were researched also.

Porter inspirationally explores the essence of intertextuality in one of his articles (Intertextuality and the Discourse Community):

{{quotation | "When we teach writing only as the act of "bringing out what is within," we risk undermining our own efforts. Intertextuality reminds us that "carrying out ritual activities" is also part of the writing process. Barthes reminds us that "the 'I' which approaches the text is already itself a plurality of other texts, of codes which are infinite".}}

This idea of 'I' being plurality of other texts is one of the reasons, why teachers in Spain often use the expression/metaphor: "Yo no existo cuando escribo un texto académico y tú no existes tampoco" which translates to: "I do not exist when I write academic text and you do not exist too". The power of this statement is the idea that one can turn intertextuality into ones own favor only once one "does not exist" when writing academic text and only once one realizes that there is no universal reader to which the text can be attributed to. The text lives its own life with its own purpose and the author is not the actual creator of the text. The author is simply translating meaning (assignment) into non-existent code, forming non-existent "I" which is intended for non-existent reader (it is rather series of different readers, often with various opinions on the text). So what is academic writing about? In essence, it's about nothing. It is an imperfect conventional form of code created by few people whom we do not know and it is surrounded by non-existent concepts. It is inherited from imperfect teachers and is bound to reveal only very small portion of all the possible infinite codes. However, this small portion can be unique. As long as it is, it provides us with new combination of codes and an opportunity to find our own existence in the nothingness which surrounds us, either through the eyes of the machine or through the eyes of our own. What is important, is our ability to recognize which former codes and which texts of the past can help us find our existence and which codes are irrelevant. As long as we are consciously aware of what we are translating from, we are not forced to shift the meaning involuntarily. Therefore, we create an opportunity for people to base their opinion on the actual meaning of the text and enable them to continue creating the non-existent, with a sense of understanding.

====Types====
There are two distinct types of intertextuality as defined by Porter:
* iterability
* presupposition

'''Iterability''' is the capability of a text to be reiterated and repeated in various contexts. Iterability is explicitly seen in texts, as opposed to presupposition, which refers to assumptions a text makes. One such example of this concept from Porter is the Declaration of Independence. Many texts and ideas of different centuries were integrated into the one document.  Jefferson took the idea of John Locke's social contract theory, the Declaration of Rights for Virginia by George Mason, and the form of the English Bill of Rights in 1689 into the Declaration of Independence. Some claimed that this was blatant plagiarism but others say it was iterability. He used the form of a list of grievances as used in the English Bill of Rights and this example proves that not only direct quotes can be reiterated but also the form of a text.  When Thomas Jefferson proposed the Declaration to congress, they made 86 changes to his actual original ideas because they were so farfetched from the current discourse community. This is an example of the constraint a discourse community can place on a text.

'''Presupposition''' is the process by which implications are made without being specifically stated or explained within text. These assumptions are usually extremely basic thoughts made by a vast majority of the audience; such thoughts may be considered "common sense" or otherwise obvious to anyone who reads the text.
Example: "Rodrigo rode his bike to his friend's house."
* This simple statement implies several facts that the reader automatically assumes. Rodrigo owns a bike, he has a friend, his friend has a house, his house is within biking distance, and Rodrigo has the ability to ride a bike.
* Details can be added or removed by an author to give more or less creative license to the readers themselves; in this case, one reader could imagine the bike being colored red, while another may believe it to be blue. Because the assumptions made by different readers can be drastically different from one another, it is important that the framework the author provides is sufficient to keep the assumptions that are crucial to the story itself constant between readers.
Example: "It was a dark and stormy night."
* This statement is iterated as a cliché opening to a story. The statement provides an opening for a fictional [[narrative]] while simultaneously implying an ominous, foreboding setting. When opening a story with this line, the author is able to instantly set a [[Grammatical mood|mood]] and [[tone (literature)|tone]] before the story truly begins, giving the reader a sense that the story is already in progress.

===Examples===
# [[Ulysses (novel)|Ulysses]]: Ulysses, a novel written by James Joyce in 1918, is an example of intertextuality because the themes largely shadow those of Homer's Odyssey (an ancient Greek epic poem). Ulysses uses the plot line from The Odyssey and retells it with a new character in a new setting, thus using past writings to create a new, original one.
# [[Aladdin (1992 Disney film)|Aladdin]]: The classic Disney movie Aladdin has many distinct examples of intertextuality throughout. For example, one scene depicts the Genie that comes out of Aladdin's lamp being pinched by a crab&amp;nbsp;– the same crab from another popular Disney movie, The Little Mermaid. In another scene, the two main characters are flying through the sky on a magic carpet and, for a moment, Zeus's temple from the movie Hercules can be seen in the background. These are examples of intertextuality because they pull from past Disney works and use them to create something new and original.
# [[West Side Story]]: West Side Story is an example of intertextuality in that it is the modern retelling of Shakespeare's tragedy of Romeo and Juliet. Tony (Romeo) and Maria (Juliet) are both in love. However, their families and the rival groups with which their loyalty lies forbid their love. West Side Story uses themes from Romeo and Juliet (such as forbidden love and a tragic ending) to create a new, original story.

The '''Academy of San Carlos''' ({{lang-es|Academia de San Carlos}}) is located at 22 Academia Street in just northeast of the [[Zocalo|main plaza]] of [[Mexico City]]. It was the first major [[art school|art academy]] and the first [[art museum]] in the [[Americas]]. It was founded in 1781 as the School of Engraving and moved to the Academia Street location about 10 years later. It emphasized classical European training until the early 20th century, when it shifted to a more modern perspective. At this time, it also integrated with the [[National Autonomous University of Mexico]], eventually becoming the [[Faculty of Arts and Design]], which is based in [[Xochimilco]]. Currently, only graduate courses of the modern school are given in the original academy building.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.arquitectuba.com.ar/monografias-de-arquitectura/academia-de-san-carlos/| title= Academia de San Carlos| language= Spanish| accessdate= 2009-03-30| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090409140215/http://www.arquitectuba.com.ar/monografias-de-arquitectura/academia-de-san-carlos/| archivedate= 2009-04-09| deadurl= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="historic"&gt;{{cite book |title=Mexico City Historic Center |last=Galindo |first=Carmen |authorlink= |author2=Magdelena Galindo |year=2002 |publisher=Ediciones Nueva Guia |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-5437-29-7 |pages=70–72 |url= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Rafael Ximeno y Planes - Portrait of Gerónimo Antonio Gil - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|[[Rafael Ximeno y Planes]], portrait of Jerónimo Antonio Gil, director of the academy]]
The Academy of San Carlos was founded in 1781 under the name of the School of Engraving.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; From that time to the present, it has been renamed many times to The Royal Academy of the Three Noble Arts of San Carlos (Real Academia de la Tres Nobles Artes de San Carlos) (1783),&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt;&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; Academia Nacional de San Carlos de México (1821); Academia Imperial de San Carlos de México (1863); Escuela Nacional de Bellas Artes (1867) and Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas (1929).&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt;  

Mexican painter [[Miguel Cabrera (painter)|Miguel Cabrera]] iterated the need for an art academy as early as 1753 but attempts by him and other prominent Mexican artists of the time to gain royal permission for such was never obtained.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt; The School of Engraving was begun later in the building that used to be the [[mint (coin)|mint]], and would later become the modern-day [[National Museum of Cultures]]. Ten years later, it moved to the former Amor de Dios Hospital, where it remains to this day.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; The street it is located on was renamed from Amor de Dios Street to Academia Street in its honor.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt;

The Academy was originally sponsored by the [[Spanish Crown]] and a number of private patrons.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; The academy was inaugurated on 4 November 1781 on the saint's day of [[King Carlos III]],&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; operating for its first ten years in the old mint building (now the [[National Museum of Cultures]]).&lt;ref name="GTM"&gt;{{cite book |title= Guia Turistica de Mexico – Distrito Federal Centro 3 |last= Bueno de Ariztegui (ed) |first=Patricia |year=1984 |publisher=Promexa |location=Mexico City |isbn=968-34-0319-0 |pages=94–98 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, it did not obtain its royal seal until 1783 and was not fully functional until 1785.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt;&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; The school moved into the old "Hospital del Amor de Dios" building in 1791, where it has remained ever since.&lt;ref name="GTM"/&gt; The academy was the first major art institution in the Americas.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt;

[[File:Rafael Ximeno y Planes - Portrait of Manuel Tolsá - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|Portrait of [[Manuel Tolsá]], by [[Rafael Ximeno y Planes]]]]
The school's first director, Italian Jeronimo Antonio Gil, was appointed by Carlos III and gathered prominent artists of the day including José de Alcíbar, [[Santiago Sandoval]], Juan Sáenz, [[Manuel Tolsá]] and [[Rafael Ximeno y Planes]].  Tolsá and Ximeno would later stay on to become directors of the school.  The new school began to promote [[Neoclassicism]], focusing on Greek and Roman art and architecture, advocating European-style training of its artists.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt; To this end, plaster casts of classic Greek and Roman statues were brought to Mexico from Europe for students to study.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;
[[File:UpperfloorSanCarlosDF.JPG|thumb|Upper floor of the building]]
Since its founding, it attracted the country's best artists, and was a force behind the abandonment of the [[Baroque]] style in Mexico, which had already gone out-of-fashion in Europe.&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt;

In the early 19th century, the academy was closed for a short time due to the [[Mexican War of Independence]]. When it reopened, it was renamed the National Academy of San Carlos and enjoyed the new government's preference for Neoclassicism, as it considered the Baroque reminiscent of colonialism. Despite the school's association with the independent Mexican government, [[Emperor Maximilian I]] (installed in Mexico by the French) protected the school during his reign, although foreign artists were shunned there.  When [[Benito Juárez]] ousted the emperor and regained the presidency of Mexico, he was reluctant to support the school and its European influence, which he considered to be a vestige of colonialism.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

The academy continued to advocate classic, European-style training of its artists until 1913. In that year, a student and teacher strike advocating a more modern approach ousted director [[Antonio Rivas Mercado]]. It was also partially integrated into University of Mexico (now UNAM) at that time, although it initially kept a large degree of autonomy.  In 1929, the architecture program was separated from the rest of the academy,&lt;ref name="arquitectuba"/&gt; and in 1953, this department was moved to the newly built [[Ciudad Universitaria|campus of UNAM]] in the south of the city. The remaining programs in painting, sculpture and engraving were renamed National School of Expressive Arts [[National School of Arts (UNAM)|Escuela Nacional de Artes Plásticas]]. Later, the undergraduate fine arts programs were moved to a facility in [[Xochimilco]], leaving only some graduate programs in the original Academy of San Carlos building.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

==Associated artists==
[[Image:Jose Maria Velasco.jpg|thumb|left|[[José María Velasco Gómez|José María Velasco]] ''Self-portrait'' (1894). Velasco dominated 19th c Mexican landscape painting.]]
Some of its most famous first teachers included [[Miguel Constanzó]] in architecture, [[José Joaquín Fabregat]] in metal engraving, Rafael Ximeno y Planes in painting and Manuel Tolsá in sculpture. Another notable teacher here was [[Pelegrí Clavé]], who was noted for his expertise in creating portraits of heroes and biblical figures.&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

[[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[Antonio Fabres]] was a dominant force at the Academy during early 20th century. He would mentor later Mexican artists such as [[Saturnino Herrán]], [[Roberto Montenegro]], [[Diego Rivera]] and [[José Clemente Orozco]].&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

[[José María Velasco Gómez|José María Velasco]] is considered the greatest artist associated with the Academy, famous for his landscapes of the [[Valley of Mexico]] and a mentor of Diego Rivera. Other artists linked to the Academy are [[Manuel Rodríguez Lozano]], [[Alfredo Zalce]], [[Andrés José López]], [[José Chávez Morado]], [[Francisco Moreno Capdevila]], [[Luis Sahagún Cortés]], [[Gabriel Fernández Ledesma]] and [[Jorge Figueroa Acosta]].&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt; [[Matusha Corkidi]] studied at the Academy after emigrating from Egypt.&lt;ref name="HellerHeller2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jules Heller|author2=Nancy G.

==Building==
[[File:AfricanartExpoSanCarlosDF.JPG|thumb|Exhibition of children's art from Africa on 25 May 2009]]
The building originally was as the Amor de Dios Hospital, which had closed by the time the School of Engraving decided to move there from the mint building. Founding director Jeronimo Antonio Gil took charge of the restoration and remodeling work. Artist [[Javier Cavallari]] created the Academy's Neoclassic facade, which is embellished with six medallions. Four of these represent the Academy's founders: Carlos III, [[Carlos IV]], Jeronimo Antonio Gil and [[Fernando José Manguino]], and the other two are of [[Michelangelo]] and [[Raphael]].  Cavallari also finished the patio, the conference room and the painting and sculpture galleries. The painting gallery contains portraits by [[Ramon Sagredo]] and the sculpture room contains works by [[José Obregón]] and [[Manuel Ocaranza]].&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

A number of plaster casts of classic statues from the [[Real Academia de Bellas Artes de San Fernando|San Fernando Fine Arts Academy]] in Spain were brought here for teaching purposes. These casts still exist and can be seen on display in the Academy's central patio. Some of these statues include casts of statues from the [[Medici]] tombs, [[Moses (Michelangelo)|Moses by Michelangelo]], The [[Victory of Samothrace]] and [[Venus de Milo]].&lt;ref name="historic"/&gt;

==Gallery==
[[File:Antiguadireccionacademiasancarlos.jpg|thumb|Old photo of the dean's office]]
The academy once had a very large collection of art in the Gallery of the San Carlos Academy, considered the first museum of art in the Americas.&lt;ref name="ciudadmexico"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mexicocity.ciudadmexico.com.mx/attractions/san_carlos.htm |title=Nacional Museum of San Carlos |accessdate=2009-03-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081203151944/http://mexicocity.ciudadmexico.com.mx/attractions/san_carlos.htm |archivedate=2008-12-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Its art collection began with plaster casts of original Greek, Roman and European works used as teaching aids. It also gained other European works such as engravings from the 16th to 19th centuries from Spain, France, England, Italy, Germany, and Holland. The school also collected works from students and teachers from its founding to beginning of the 20thcentury. However, the collection outgrew the original academy building as it received donations from private sources and purchases made by the Mexican government after independence. The collection was divided, some going to the [[Museo Universitario de la Academia]], also in the historic center of town, some going to the [[National Museum of San Carlos]], northeast of the historic center and the rest remaining in the original building.&lt;ref name="ciudadmexico"/&gt;&lt;ref name="plaster"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.plastercastcollection.org/en/database.php?d=lire&amp;id=109 |title= Academia San Carlos, Mexico City |accessdate=2009-03-30 | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090503210030/http://www.plastercastcollection.org/en/database.php?d=lire&amp;id=109| archivedate= 3 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Articulatory gestures''' are the actions necessary to enunciate language.   Examples of articulatory gestures are the hand movements necessary to enunciate sign language and the mouth movements of speech.   In [[semiotic]] terms, they are the physical embodiment (signifiers) of speech signs, which are gestural by nature (see below).

The definition of ''[[gesture]]'' varies greatly, but here it will be taken in its widest sense, namely, any meaningful action.   An intentional action is meaningful if it is not strictly utilitarian: for example, sending flowers to a friend is a gesture, because this action is performed not only for the purpose of moving flowers from one place to another, but also to express some sentiment or even a conventional message in the [[language of flowers]].  Use of the broadest definition of gesture (not restricted to hand movements) allows [[Charles F. Hockett|Hockett]]’s  “rapid fading” [[design features of language | design feature of human language]] to be accommodated as a type of sign in semiotic theory.

But if an articulatory gesture is to be considered a true gesture in the above sense, it must be meaningful.   Therefore, an articulatory gesture must be at least as large as the smallest meaningful unit of language, the morpheme.  A morpheme corresponds roughly to a spoken word or a sign language gesture.   

This definition differs from the practice, common among linguists,  of referring to phonemes (meaningless mouth movements) as articulatory gestures (see [[articulatory phonology]]).   In [[semiotics]], meaningless components of spoken gestures (written as individual letters), or meaningless components of sign language gestures (such as location of hand contact) are known as [[figurae]], the constituents of signs.    

It also differs from the tradition of considering speech sounds to be the signifiers of speech signs.  But this practice confuses signals with symbols.  Sound and light are analogue signals, whereas mouth and hand gestures are discrete symbolic entities.  A sound or light signal is subject to random noise, whereas the image of the gesture is subject to regular [[image distortion | distortion]], as when a signer’s hand is viewed from different angles. In speech, the sound of the contact of the tongue in the letter T can be distorted by surrounding mouth movements, as in the phrase “perfect memory”.  When pronounced at conversational speed, the sound of the tongue contact is completely obscured by surrounding consonants even though this T movement is fully carried out.

Articulatory gestures, when seen as the physical embodiment of speech and sign language symbols, provide a link between these two language types, and show how speech resembles sign language more closely than is generally presumed.

In later Roman versions, only the ridiculous characters read their lines in Oscan, while the others used Latin.

==History==
Atellan Farce evidence is scarce, but surviving fragments point to the comedy genre coming about no earlier than 90 BC.&lt;ref&gt;W.Beare Cambridge University Press, Platus and the Fabula Atellana&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Stock characters==
Some of the hypothesized [[stock character]]s included:
* '''Maccus''' ("The Fool", a hunchbacked, beak nosed character)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Commedia Dell'Arte|last=Smith|first=Winifred|publisher=Benjamin Bloom|year=1964|isbn=|location=New York|pages=22|quote=A grotesque statuette representing a beak-nosed, hunchbacked individual, was unearthed at Herculaneum in 1727, which by a slight stretch of imagination could be identified with Maccus|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Punch and Judy: Its Origin and Evolution|last=Byrom|first=Michael|publisher=Shiva Publications|year=1972|isbn=0902982028|location=Aberdeen|pages=4|quote=There was the old man (Pappus), the old woman, the comic slave (Centunculus), the country booby (Buccus), the arrogant soldier (Manducus), the pompous doctor (Dossenus), and the sharp-tongued hooked nosed hunchback (Maccus).|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Buccus''' (the country booby)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Manducus''' (the arrogant soldier)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Pappus''' (the old man)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Centunculus''' (the comic slave) &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
* '''Dosseunus''' (the pompous doctor) &lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
There has been some debate of these characters connection to similar stock characters in [[Commedia dell'arte]], as well as [[Punch and Judy]]. Atellan Farce and Commedia were both improvised masked comedies. Some Historians argue that the stock characters in Atellan Farce are the beginnings of what would become the stock characters of Commedia dell'arte.

Some of the theorized character progressions are as follows:
* '''Pappus''' → [[Pantalone]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Italian Comedy|last=Duchartre|first=Peirre|publisher=Dover Publications, INC|year=1966|isbn=|location=New York|pages=17|quote=The ancestor of Pantaloon, and his son Harpagon, is Pappus, the lecherous old miser of the Antellane|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Commedia dell'Arte|last=Oreglia|first=Giacomo|publisher=Hill and Wang|year=1968|isbn=|location=New York|pages=78|quote=In the ancient theatre the characters which recall this Mask are those of the various old men of Aristophanes, Plautus, Terence, and the Pappus of the Atella comedies|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Maccus+Buccu'''s → [[Pulcinella]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Italian Comedy|last=Duchartre|first=Pierre|publisher=The Dover Publications, INC|year=1966|isbn=|location=New York|pages=18|quote=The cradle of the family was the ancient city of Atella, in the Roman Campangna, and the gallery of ancestors shows, among others Bucco and the sensual Maccus, whose lean figure and cowardly nature reappear in Pulcinella|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Italian Comedy|last=Duchartre|first=Pierre|publisher=Dover Publication, INC|year=1966|isbn=|location=|pages=29|quote=Pulcinella was always dressed in white like Maccus, the mimus albus, or white mime|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Manducus''' → [[il Capitano]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Italian Comedy|last=Duchartre|first=Pierre|publisher=The Dover Publications, INC|year=1966|isbn=|location=New York|pages=18|quote=Next there is the ogre Manducus, the Miles Glorious in the plays of Plautus, who is later metamorphosed into the swaggering Captain, or Captain.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, the connection of Atellan Farce to Commedia dell'arte and assumption that Atellan Farce is the precursor to Commedia dell'arte is still under debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Commedia Dell'Arte|last=Smith|first=Winifred|publisher=Benjamin Blom|year=1964|isbn=|location=New York|pages=21|quote=page 21 Not a little nonsense has been written about the “evolution” of the commedai dell’arte. Of the three main theories that attempt to account for our farces the hoariest and most outgrown is that concerning their putative Roman father, surely a ghost that by now ought to be permately laid.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As for Atellan Farce's connection to Punch and Judy, the similarities between Punch and the Commedia dell'arte character Pulcinella are notable. However, many historians still debate whether or not Punch's derivation can be traced back to Pulcinella.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Commedia Dell'Arte|last=Smith|first=Winifred|publisher=Benjamin Blom|year=1964|isbn=|location=New York|pages=23|quote=The identification of the statuette with a future in the Mimes or even with a stage character at all is very uncertain, nor is it safe to press its resemblance to the English Punch; there is no doubt that it looks like Punch but this, I think, is vest explained by the fame of the figure at the time of its discovery and by the influence of its peculiarities on the face and figure of the English villain-clown.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Punch and Judy: Its Origin and Evolution|last=Byrom|first=Michael|publisher=Shiva Publications|year=1972|isbn=0902982028|location=Aberbeen|pages=5|quote=In 1662, Pulcinella crossed the English Channel and became 'Punchinello' later to be known simply as Punch.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
At first, the subjects were decided upon before the performance began and the dialogue was improvised as it proceeded. The performers were the sons of Roman citizens, who did not lose their rights as citizens, and were allowed to serve in the army: professional actors were excluded. The simple prose dialogues were probably varied by songs in the rude Saturnian metre: the language was that of the common people, accompanied by lively gesticulation and movements. They were characterized by coarseness and obscenity.&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=y|wstitle=Atellanae Fabulae|volume=2|page=824}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later, it is believed that the dictator [[Sulla]] wrote some Atellan Fables. [[Quintus Novius]], who flourished 50 years after the abdication of Sulla, wrote some fifty, including ''Macchus Sexul'' ("Exiled Macchus"), ''Gallinaria'' ("The Henhouse"), ''Surdus'' ("The Deaf One"), ''Vindemiatores'' ("The Harvesters"), and ''Parcus'' (“The Treasurer”).

[[Lucius Pomponius]], of [[Bologna]], is known to have composed a few, including ''Macchus Miles'' ("Macchus the Soldier"),  ''Pytho Gorgonius'', ''Pseudoagamemnon'', ''Bucco Adoptatus'', and ''Aeditumus''. He was also said to have been influenced by the Palliata [[Fabius Dorsennus]]. [[Quintus Novius]] and a "Memmius" were also authors of these comedies; [[Ovid]] and [[Pliny the Younger]] found the work of Memmius to be indecent.

==Controversy and suppression==
{{Citation needed|reason=I have not found any other source other than Wikipedia itself stating this information about the Atellan Farces becoming illegal |date=July 2018}}
Taken from [[Tacitus]] ( [[Annals (Tacitus)|Annals]], Book 4): "...after various and often fruitless complaints from the praetors, the emperor [[Tiberius]] finally brought forward a motion about the licentious behavior of the players.  'They had often,' he said.  'Sought to disturb the public peace, and to bring disgrace on private families, and the old Oscan farce, once a wretched amusement for the vulgar, had become at once so indecent and popular, that it must be checked by the Senate's authority'.  The players, upon this, were banished from Italy".

[[Suetonius]] ('' [[The Twelve Caesars#Tiberius|Tiberius]]'', 45, 1) reports that Tiberius himself was mocked for his lecherous habits in an Atellan farce, after which the saying "the old goat lapping up the doe" (''hircum vetulum capreis naturam ligurire'') became popular.

The above passage suggests a growth in popularity or maybe even a revival of these farces, in the 20s AD, that met the disapproval of an older generation of patricians and senators.  Perhaps they were even performed out in public places as an act of direct hostility towards (or a means to mock) specific people or families.  At any rate, these performances eventually became so obnoxious that, in 28 AD, all those who performed in these farces were banished from Italy.

The ''[[Augustan History]]'' records that [[Hadrian]] furnished performances of Atellan Farces at banquets.&lt;ref&gt;''HA'' Hadrian 26.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:AwardPins wb.jpg|thumb|A variety of award pins, the largest of which is only 1 inch (2.5 cm) wide.]] --&gt;

An '''award pin''' is a small object, usually made from [[metal]] or [[plastic]], with a pin on the back, presented as an [[award]] of achievement or a mark of appreciation. They are worn on clothes such as jackets, shirts or hats.

Award pins usually have an image or words, or both, depicting the reason for the award. 

An award pin series that is offered by the [[U.S. Government]] to all eligible civilians is the [[Pilot Proficiency Award Program]].
Award pins are commonly given to participants of youth sports as a method to reinforce excellent play and sportsmanship. There are many companies that provide Sports Award Pins. 

Award pins can usually be plated on Gold (Plain or antique), Silver (plain or antique), Nickel and Black Nickel or Copper (plain or antique).

During the manufacturing process pins can be filled with enamel colors and then covered with a thin coat of epoxy to protect these colors.

[[File:BBC Domesday Project Community Disc initial screen.jpg|thumb|1986 ''Domesday Book'' running on its original hardware]]

The '''BBC Domesday Project''' was a partnership between [[Acorn Computers]], [[Philips]], [[Logica]] and the [[BBC]] (with some funding from the [[European Commission]]'s [[European Strategic Program on Research in Information Technology|ESPRIT]] programme) to mark the 900th anniversary of the original ''[[Domesday Book]]'', an 11th-century [[census]] of England. It has been cited as an example of [[digital obsolescence]] on account of the physical medium used for data storage.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://science.slashdot.org/story/02/03/03/1821227/1086-Domesday-Book-Outlives-1986-Electronic-Rival|title= 1086 Domesday Book Outlives 1986 Electronic Rival|first= Timothy|last= Lord|date= 3 March 2002|work= science.slashdot.org|publisher= [[Geeknet]]|location= Mountain View, California|accessdate= 23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last1 = Cohen| first1 = Daniel J| last2 = Rosenzweig| first2 = Roy| author2-link = Roy Rosenzweig| title = Digital History: A Guide to Gathering, Preserving, and Presenting the Past on the Web| url = http://chnm.gmu.edu/digitalhistory/| accessdate = 23 March 2011| date = 30 August 2005| publisher = [[University of Pennsylvania Press]]| location = Philadelphia| isbn = 978-0-8122-1923-4| chapter = Preserving Digital History| chapterurl = http://chnm.gmu.edu/digitalhistory/preserving/| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110225022241/http://chnm.gmu.edu/digitalhistory/| archivedate = 25 February 2011 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.csa.com/discoveryguides/cyber/overview.php|title= Lost in Cyberspace: The BBC Domesday Project and the Challenge of Digital Preservation|first= Douglas|last=  Brown|date=June 2003|work= Discovery Guides|publisher= [[ProQuest]]|location= Ann Arbor, Michigan|accessdate= 23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.suzannekeene.info/conserve/digipres/tech.htm |title=Practical challenges: Technical obsolescence |first=Suzanne |last=Keene |year=2006 |work=Now you see it, now you won't: Preserving digital cultural material |publisher=Suzanne Keene |location=London |at= |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060831170742/http://www.suzannekeene.info/conserve/digipres/tech.htm |archivedate=31 August 2006 |accessdate=23 March 2011 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

This new [[multimedia]] edition of Domesday was compiled between 1984 and 1986 and published in 1986. It included a new "survey" of the United Kingdom, in which people, mostly school children, wrote about geography, history or social issues in their local area or just about their daily lives. Children from over 9,000 schools were involved.&lt;ref name="newscientist lamb 1985"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; This was linked with maps, and many colour photos, statistical data, video and "virtual walks". Over 1 million people participated in the project. The project also incorporated professionally prepared video footage, [[virtual reality]] tours of major landmarks and other prepared datasets such as the 1981 census.

== Purpose ==

The project includes local information gathered and stored by school pupils, in order to create an up-to-date version.&lt;ref name="newscientist lamb 1985" /&gt;

{{quotation|As the computer takes over the role of storing and sorting the data, children can increasingly involve themselves in analysing [its] significance.|Bill O'Neill, [[University of Ulster]]|cited by John Lamb in ''[[New Scientist]], 28 March 1985''&lt;ref name="newscientist lamb 1985" /&gt;}}

== Format ==
[[File:BBC Domesday machine keyboard.jpg|thumb|Function key strip for navigation]]
The project was stored on adapted [[LaserDisc]]s in the [[LaserVision Read Only Memory]] (LV-ROM) format, which contained not only analogue video and still pictures, but also digital data, with 300 MB of storage space on each side of the disc. Data and images were selected and collated by the BBC Domesday project based in Bilton House in West Ealing. Pre-mastering of data was carried out on a [[VAX-11|VAX-11/750]] mini-computer, assisted by a network of BBC micros. The discs were mastered, produced, and tested by the Philips Laservision factory in Blackburn, England. Viewing the discs required an Acorn [[BBC Master]] expanded with a [[SCSI]] controller and an additional [[coprocessor]] controlled Philips VP415 "Domesday Player", a specially produced laserdisc player. The user interface consisted of the BBC Master's keyboard and a [[trackball]] (known at the time as a trackerball). The software for the project was written in [[BCPL]] (a precursor to [[C (programming language)|C]]), to make cross platform porting easier, although BCPL never attained the popularity that its early promise suggested it might.

The project was split over two laserdiscs:
*The ''Community Disc'' contained personal reflections on life in Britain and is navigated on a geographic map of Britain. The entire country was divided into blocks that were 4&amp;nbsp;km wide by 3&amp;nbsp;km long, based on [[Ordnance Survey]] grid references. Each block could contain up to 3 photographs and a number of short reflections on life in that area. Most, but not all, of the blocks are covered in this way. In addition more detailed maps of key urban areas and blocks of 40x30 km and regional views were captured, allowing "zoom-out" and "zoom-in" functions. The community disc was double sided, with a "Southern" and a "Northern" side, although country-wide data at the 40x30km level and above was on both sides.
*The ''National Disc'' contained more varied material, including data from the 1981 [[census]], sets of professional photographs and [[virtual reality]]-like walkarounds shot for the project. Side 2 of the National disc contained video material. The material was stored in a hierarchy and some of it could be browsed by walking around a virtual art gallery, clicking on the pictures on the wall, or walking through doors in the gallery to enter the VR walkarounds. In addition a natural language search was provided via an English stemming and matching algorithm to a set of keywords.

[[File:VCF 2010 Domesday tray open.jpg|thumb|alt=A BBC Master computer, laserdisc and player on exhibition|A Domesday system at the [[Vintage Computer Festival|VCF]]-[[Great Britain|GB]] 2010]]
In 2002, there were great fears that the discs would become unreadable as computers capable of reading the format had become rare and drives capable of accessing the discs even rarer. Aside from the difficulty of emulating the original code, a major issue was that the still images had been stored on the laserdisc as single-frame analogue video, which were [[Genlock|overlaid]] by the computer system's graphical interface. The project had begun years before [[JPEG]] image compression and before [[True Color|truecolour]] computer video cards had become widely available.

However, the BBC later announced that the [[CAMiLEON]] project (a partnership between the [[University of Leeds]] and [[University of Michigan]]) had developed a system capable of accessing the discs using [[emulator|emulation]] techniques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Robin | last = McKie |author2=Thorpe, Vanessa | title = Digital Domesday Book lasts 15 years not 1000 | date = 2002-03-03 | publisher = [[Guardian Media Group]] | url = https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2002/mar/03/research.elearning | work = [[The Guardian]] | accessdate = 2011-07-18 | quote = 'That means we have to find a way to emulate this data, in other words to turn into a form that can be used no matter what is the computer format of the future. That is the real goal of this project.'}}&lt;/ref&gt; CAMiLEON copied the video footage from one of the extant Domesday laserdiscs. Another team, working for the UK [[National Archives (UK)|National Archives]] (who hold the original Domesday Book) tracked down the original 1-inch videotape masters of the project. These were digitised and archived to [[Digital Betacam]].
[[File:BBC Domesday machine at Interesting 2011.jpg|thumb|left|The Domesday machine in 2011]]

A version of one of the discs was created that runs on a Windows PC. This version was reverse-engineered from an original Domesday Community disc and incorporates images from the videotape masters. It was initially available only via a terminal at the National Archives headquarters in Kew, Surrey, but was published on the web in July 2004. This version was taken off-line early in 2008 when its programmer, Adrian Pearce, suddenly died.

The deputy editor of the Domesday Project, Mike Tibbets, has criticized the UK's National Data Archive to which the archive material was originally entrusted, arguing that the creators knew that the technology would be short-lived but that the archivists had failed to preserve the material effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://catless.ncl.ac.uk/Risks/25.44.html#subj7|title= Re: BBC Domesday Project (Leeson, RISKS-21.93)|first= Mike|last= Tibbetts|date= 4 November 2008|work= The Risks Digest|publisher= ACM Committee on Computers and Public Policy|location= Newcastle upon Tyne|accessdate= 23 March 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[The Centre for Computing History]] has undertaken a similar project to preserve the data from the Domesday Project and make it available online. They already have data from both the National Disk and Community Disk online and are currently investigating copyright issues before releasing the URL to the general public.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.computinghistory.org.uk/news/14450/Museum-Helps-BBC-Domesday-Reloaded-Project/ Museum Helps BBC Domesday Reloaded Project]&lt;/ref&gt; They have a working Domesday system on display and accessible to the public. They also have possibly the largest Domesday and interactive laserdisc archive in the world.

[[The National Museum of Computing]] based beside [[Bletchley Park]] in [[Milton Keynes]] previously had two working Domesday systems but has retired the displays as of 2017.

In 2011 a team at BBC Learning, headed by [[George Auckland]] republished much of the Community disc data in a short-lived web based format.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://katydartford.wordpress.com/2011/03/02/domesday-project-for-bbc-london/|title= Domesday project for BBC London|first= Katy|last= Dartford|date= 2 March 2011|work= Katy Dartford's blog|publisher= [[WordPress.com]]|accessdate= 12 April 2011|quote= 25 years on, in May 2011, the BBC will release around 25,000 photos of British life and landscapes and approximately 150,000 pages of accompanying text, onto the Domesday Reloaded website.}}&lt;/ref&gt; This data comprising around 25,000 images was loaded onto the [[BBC Domesday Reloaded]] website which went online in May 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url= http://www.nlcaonline.org.uk/page_id__836_path__0p18p113p126p.aspx|title= BBC Domesday reloaded: Call for community contributors|first= Melita|last= Dennett|date= 5 April 2011|publisher= North Laine Community Association|location= [[Brighton]]|accessdate= 12 April 2011|quote= &amp;#91;T&amp;#93;he data has been extracted and the BBC would like to update the information on the discs for a new website, Domesday Reloaded.}}&lt;/ref&gt; and offline (with some content archived elsewhere) in June 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/blogs/domesday|title=The Last Post|last=Mansfield|first=Alex|date=|website=BBC Domesday Reloaded|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The data extraction underlying the Domesday Reloaded site was carried out in 2003 and 2004 by Simon Guerrero and Eric Freeman.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pcplus.techradar.com/2011/06/01/rescuing-the-domesday-project-part-one/ |title=Rescuing the Domesday Project (part 1) |first=Eric |last=Freeman |date=1 June 2011 |work=PC Plus Article |publisher=[[pcplus.techradar.com]] |accessdate=15 April 2013 |quote=Eric Freeman's account of the BBC's Domesday Project restoration. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421063155/http://pcplus.techradar.com/2011/06/01/rescuing-the-domesday-project-part-one/ |archivedate=21 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pcplus.techradar.com/2011/06/01/rescuing-the-domesday-project-part-two/ |title=Rescuing the Domesday Project (part 2) |first=Eric |last=Freeman |date=1 June 2011 |work=PC Plus Article |publisher=[[pcplus.techradar.com]] |accessdate=15 April 2013 |quote=Eric Freeman's account of the BBC's Domesday Project restoration. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421063213/http://pcplus.techradar.com/2011/06/01/rescuing-the-domesday-project-part-two/ |archivedate=21 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://pcplus.techradar.com/2011/06/01/rescuing-the-domesday-project-part-three/ |title=Rescuing the Domesday Project (part 3) |first=Eric |last=Freeman |date=1 June 2011 |work=PC Plus Article |publisher=[[pcplus.techradar.com]] |accessdate=15 April 2013 |quote=Eric Freeman's account of the BBC's Domesday Project restoration. |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421063237/http://pcplus.techradar.com/2011/06/01/rescuing-the-domesday-project-part-three/ |archivedate=21 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Self-published inline|date=July 2018}}

== Copyright issues ==
In addition to preserving the project, untangling the [[copyright]] issues also presents a significant challenge. In addition to copyright surrounding the many contributions made by the estimated 1 million people who took part in the project, there are also copyright issues that relate to the technologies employed. It is likely that the Domesday Project will not be completely free of copyright restrictions until at least 2090 (assuming no further extensions of copyright terms).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www2.si.umich.edu/CAMILEON/reports/IPRreport.doc |title=The CAMiLEON Project: Legal issues arising from the work aiming to preserve elements of the interactive multimedia work entitled "The BBC Domesday Project." |first=Andrew |last=Charlesworth |date=5 November 2002 |publisher=Information Law and Technology Unit, University of Hull |location=Kingston upon Hull |format=Microsoft Word |accessdate=23 March 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110206080418/http://www2.si.umich.edu/CAMILEON/reports/IPRreport.doc |archivedate=6 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Frankenstein's monster (Boris Karloff).jpg|thumb|[[Boris Karloff]] in [[James Whale]]'s 1931 film ''[[Frankenstein (1931 film)|Frankenstein]]'', based on [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 [[Frankenstein|novel]]. The monster is created by an unorthodox [[biology]] experiment.]]
[[Biology]] appears in fiction, especially but not only in [[science fiction]], both in the shape of real aspects of the science, used as themes or plot devices, and in the form of fictional elements, whether fictional extensions or applications of biological theory, or through the invention of [[Lists of fictional species|fictional organisms]]. Major aspects of biology found in fiction include [[evolution in fiction|evolution]], [[disease in fiction|disease]], [[genetics in fiction|genetics]], [[parasitism in fiction|parasitism]] and [[symbiosis in fiction|symbiosis (mutualism)]], and [[ecology]].

[[Speculative evolution]] enables authors with sufficient skill to create what the critic Helen N. Parker calls biological [[parable]]s, illuminating the human condition from an [[Extraterrestrial life|alien]] viewpoint. [[Extraterrestrials in fiction|Fictional alien animals and plants]], especially [[humanoid]]s, have frequently been created simply to provide entertaining monsters. Zoologists such as Sam Levin have argued that, driven by [[natural selection]] on other planets, aliens might indeed tend to resemble humans to some extent.

Major themes of science fiction include messages of optimism or pessimism; Helen N. Parker has noted that in biological fiction, pessimism is by far the dominant outlook. Early works such as [[H. G. Wells]]'s novels explored the grim consequences of Darwinian evolution, ruthless competition, and the dark side of human nature; [[Aldous Huxley]]'s ''[[Brave New World]]'' was similarly gloomy about the effects of [[genetic engineering]]. 

Fictional biology, too, has enabled major science fiction authors like [[Stanley Weinbaum]], [[Isaac Asimov]], [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]] to create what Parker called biological [[parable]]s, with convincing portrayals of alien worlds able to support deep analogies with Earth and humanity.

==Aspects of biology==

Aspects of biology found in fiction include evolution, disease, ecology, genetics, parasitism, and mutualism (symbiosis).&lt;ref name="SFEbiology"&gt;{{cite web |author=Stableford, Brian |title=Biology |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/biology |website=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |date=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Parker|1977|pp=11-16 and passim}}{{sfn|Koboldt|2018|pp=37–65}}

===Evolution===
{{main|Evolution in fiction}}

[[Evolution]], including [[speculative evolution]], has been an important theme in fiction since the late 19th century. It began, however, before [[Charles Darwin]]'s time, and reflects [[orthogenesis|progressionist]] and [[Lamarck]]ist views (as in [[Camille Flammarion]]'s 1887 ''Lumen'') as well as Darwin's. [[Darwinian evolution]] is pervasive in literature, whether taken optimistically in terms of how humanity may evolve towards perfection, or pessimistically in terms of the dire consequences of the interaction of human nature and the struggle for survival.{{sfn|Parker|1977|p=80 and passim}}&lt;ref name=SFEevolution&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stableford |first1=Brian M. |last2=Langford |first2=David R. |title=Evolution |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/evolution |work=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |publisher=Gollancz |accessdate=24 July 2018 |date=5 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NYT1986"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Levine |first1=George |title=Darwin and the Evolution of Fiction |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1986/10/05/books/darwin-and-the-evolution-of-fiction.html |accessdate=24 July 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=5 October 1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other themes include the replacement of humanity, either by other species or by [[intelligent machine]]s.&lt;ref name=SFEevolution/&gt;

===Disease===
{{main|Disease in fiction|Tuberculosis in human culture}}
[[File:Famous fantastic mysteries 194902.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Jack London]]'s 1912 ''[[The Scarlet Plague]]'' (reprinted in 1949) takes place after an uncontrollable [[epidemic]].]]

[[Disease]]s, both real and fictional, play a significant role in both literary and science fiction, some like [[Huntington's disease in popular culture|Huntington's disease]] and [[Tuberculosis in human culture|tuberculosis]] appearing in many books and films. [[Pandemic]] plagues threatening all human life, such as ''[[The Andromeda Strain]]'', are among the many [[List of fictional diseases|fictional diseases]] described in literature and film. Science fiction takes an interest, too, in imagined advances in [[medicine]].&lt;ref name="Dugdale2014"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dugdale |first1=John |title=Plague fiction – why authors love to write about pandemics |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/booksblog/2014/aug/01/plague-fiction-writers-infectious-disease |accessdate=26 July 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SFEmedicine"&gt;{{cite web |author1=Stableford, Brian |author2=&lt;!--"JSC/DRL"--&gt; |title=Medicine |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/medicine |website=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |date=25 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' suggests that the abundance of [[apocalyptic fiction]] describing the "near annihilation or total extinction of the human race" by threats including deadly [[virus]]es rises when general "fear and unease", as measured by the [[Doomsday Clock]], increase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1="I.S." |title=Charting trends in apocalyptic and post-apocalyptic fiction |url=https://www.economist.com/prospero/2017/04/12/charting-trends-in-apocalyptic-and-post-apocalyptic-fiction |accessdate=5 November 2018 |work=[[The Economist]] |date=12 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuberculosis was a common disease in the 19th century. In [[Russian literature]], it appeared in several major works. [[Fyodor Dostoevsky]] used the theme of the consumptive [[nihilist]] repeatedly, with Katerina Ivanovna in ''[[Crime and Punishment]]''; Kirillov in ''[[The Possessed (novel)|The Possessed]]'', and both Ippolit and Marie in ''[[The Idiot (novel)|The Idiot]].'' [[Turgenev]] did the same with Bazarov in ''[[Father and Sons]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=O'Connor |first=Terry |title=Tuberculosis:Overview |work=International Encyclopedia of Public Health |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WAnpCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=RA6-PA241 |year=2016 |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-803708-9 |page=241}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[English literature]] of the [[Victorian era]], major tuberculosis novels include [[Charles Dickens]]'s 1848 ''[[Dombey and Son]]'', [[Elizabeth Gaskell]]'s 1855 ''[[North and South (Gaskell novel)|North and South]]'', and [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mrs. Humphry Ward]]'s 1900 ''Eleanor''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lawlor |first1=Clark |title=Katherine Byrne, Tuberculosis and the Victorian Literary Imagination |url=http://www.bsls.ac.uk/reviews/romantic-and-victorian/katherine-byrne-tuberculosis-and-the-victorian-literary-imagination/ |publisher=British Society for Literature and Science |accessdate=11 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Byrne, Katherine |title=Tuberculosis and the Victorian Literary Imagination |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=2011 |isbn=978-1-107-67280-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Genetics is a young science, having started in 1900 with the rediscovery of [[Gregor Mendel]]'s study on the inheritance of [[phenotypic trait|traits]] in pea plants. During the 20th century it developed to create new sciences and technologies including [[molecular biology]], [[DNA sequencing]], cloning, and genetic engineering. The [[bioethics|ethical implications]] of modifying humans (and all their descendants) were brought into focus with the eugenics movement. Since then, many [[science fiction]] novels and films have used aspects of genetics as plot devices, often taking one of two routes: a genetic accident with disastrous consequences; or, the feasibility and desirability of a planned genetic alteration. The treatment of science in these stories has been uneven and often unrealistic.&lt;ref name="Koboldt2014"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Koboldt |first1=Daniel |title=Genetics Myths in Fiction Writing |url=http://dankoboldt.com/genetics-myths-fiction-writing/ |accessdate=19 July 2018 |date=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Koboldt2018"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Koboldt |first1=Daniel |title=Putting the Science in Fiction |url=http://dankoboldt.com/writing/putting-the-science-in-fiction/ |accessdate=19 July 2018 |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moraga&gt;{{cite web |last=Moraga |first=Roger |title=Modern Genetics in the World of Fiction |url=http://clarkesworldmagazine.com/moraga_11_09/ |publisher=Clarkesworld magazine |accessdate=19 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1997 film ''[[Gattaca]]'' did attempt to portray science accurately but was criticised by scientists.&lt;ref name="Kirby2000"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Kirby |first=David A. |title=The New Eugenics in Cinema: Genetic Determinism and Gene Therapy in "GATTACA" |journal=Science Fiction Studies |date=July 2000 |volume=27 |issue=2 |pages=193–215 |jstor=4240876}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Michael Crichton]]'s 1990 novel ''[[Jurassic Park (novel)|Jurassic Park]]'' portrayed the cloning of whole [[dinosaur]] [[genome]]s from [[fossil]] remains of species extinct for millions of years, and their use to recreate living animals,&lt;ref name=Moraga/&gt; using what was then known of genetics and [[molecular biology]] to create an "entertaining" and "thought-provoking" story.{{sfn|Koboldt|2018|page=51}}

The lack of scientific understanding of genetics in the 19th century did not prevent science fiction works such as [[Mary Shelley]]'s 1818 novel ''[[Frankenstein]]'' and [[H. G. Wells]]'s  1896 ''[[The Island of Dr Moreau]]'' from exploring themes of biological experiment, mutation, and hybridisation, with their disastrous consequences, asking serious questions about the nature of humanity and responsibility for science.&lt;ref name=Moraga/&gt;

===Parasitism===
{{main|Parasites in fiction}}
[[File:Paisley Abbey "Xenomorph" Gargoyle (10317339143) (cropped).jpg|thumb|A 1990s [[gargoyle]] at [[Paisley Abbey]] resembling a [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Xenomorph]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Budanovic |first1=Nikola |title=An explanation emerges for how the 12th century Paisley Abbey in Scotland could feature a gargoyle out of the film "Alien" |url=https://www.thevintagenews.com/2018/03/10/alien-gargoyle/ |publisher=The Vintage News |accessdate=17 June 2018 |date=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[parasitoid]] from ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]''&lt;ref name=BBCAlien&gt;{{cite web |title='Alien' gargoyle on ancient Paisley Abbey |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-glasgow-west-23810979 |publisher=[[British Broadcasting Corporation]] |accessdate=17 June 2018 |date=23 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Parasite]]s appear frequently in fiction, from ancient times onwards as seen in mythical figures like the blood-drinking [[Lilith]], with a flowering in the nineteenth century.&lt;ref name=ESF&gt;{{cite web |title=Parasitism and Symbiosis |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/parasitism_and_symbiosis |publisher=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |date=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include intentionally disgusting alien monsters in [[science fiction]] films, though these are sometimes less "horrible" than real examples in nature. Authors and scriptwriters have to some extent exploited parasite biology: lifestyles including [[parasitoid]], [[behaviour-altering parasite]], [[brood parasite]], [[parasitic castrator]], and many forms of [[vampire]] are found in books and films.&lt;ref name="Guarino2017"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Guarino |first1=Ben |title=Disgusting 'Alien' movie monster not as horrible as real things in nature |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/speaking-of-science/wp/2017/05/19/disgusting-alien-movie-monster-not-as-horrible-as-real-things-in-nature/ |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=19 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glassy2005&gt;{{cite book |last=Glassy |first=Mark C. |title=The Biology of Science Fiction Cinema |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ubmJCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA186 |year=2005 |publisher=McFarland |isbn=978-1-4766-0822-8 |pages=186 ff}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Moisseeff2014&gt;{{cite web |last1=Moisseeff |first1=Marika |title=Aliens as an Invasive Reproductive Power in Science Fiction |url=https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00935705 |website=HAL Archives-Ouvertes |date=23 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Williams1997&gt;{{cite web |last1=Williams |first1=Robyn |last2=Field |first2=Scott |title=Behaviour, Evolutionary Games and ....

Some fictional parasites, like the deadly parasitoid [[Alien (creature in Alien franchise)|Xenomorphs]] in ''[[Alien (film)|Alien]]'', have become well known in their own right.&lt;ref name=BBCAlien/&gt; Terrifying monsters are clearly alluring: writer Matt Kaplan notes that they induce signs of stress including raised heart rate and sweating, but people continue indulging in such works. Kaplan compares this to the "masochism" of liking very hot spicy foods, which induce mouth burns, sweating, and tears. The psychologist Paul Rozin suggests that there is a pleasure in seeing one's own body react as if to stress while knowing that no real harm will result.&lt;!--like the 18th century aesthetic pleasure in the sublime, by the way--&gt;&lt;ref name="Kaplan 2012"&gt;{{cite book | last=Kaplan | first=Matt | title=Medusa's gaze and vampire's bite : the science of monsters | publisher=Scribner | publication-place=New York | year=2012 | isbn=978-1-4516-6799-8 | oclc=779266095 |pages=2-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Symbiosis===
{{main|Symbiosis in fiction}}

[[Mutualism (biology)|Symbiosis (mutualism)]] appears in fiction, especially [[science fiction]], as a plot device. It is distinguished from [[parasitism in fiction]], a similar theme, by the mutual benefit to the organisms involved, whereas the [[parasite]] inflicts harm on its host. Fictional symbionts often confer special powers on their hosts.&lt;ref name="SFE-parasitism-symbiosis"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Stableford |first1=Brian M. |title=Parasitism and Symbiosis |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/parasitism_and_symbiosis |work=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |publisher=Gollancz |accessdate=25 July 2018 |date=10 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Second World War]], science fiction moved towards more mutualistic relationships, as in [[Ted White (author)|Ted White]]'s 1970 ''By Furies Possessed'', which viewed aliens positively.&lt;ref name=SFE-parasitism-symbiosis/&gt;&lt;!--[[The Force]] in the ''[[Star Wars]]'' universe is described by the fictional seer [[Obi-Wan Kenobi]] as "an energy field created by all living things".--&gt; In ''[[The Phantom Menace]]'', [[Qui-Gon Jinn]] says microscopic lifeforms called midi-chlorians, inside all living cells, allow characters with enough of these symbionts in their cells to feel and use the Force.&lt;ref name="BrooksEpisodeI"&gt;{{cite book |title=Star Wars Episode I: The Phantom Menace |last=Brooks |first=Terry |authorlink=Terry Brooks |date=1999 |publisher=[[Ballantine Books]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--In [[Douglas Adams]]'s humorous 1978 ''[[The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy]]'', the [[Babel fish (The Hitchhiker's Guide to the Galaxy)|Babel fish]] lives in its human host's ear, feeding on the energy of its host's brain waves, in return translating any language to the host's benefit.&lt;ref&gt;''The Hitchhiker’s Guide to the Galaxy: Fit the First'' BBC Radio 4 program, broadcast 8 March 1978&lt;/ref&gt;--&gt;

===Ecology===

[[Ecology]], the study of the relationships between organisms and their environment, appears in fiction in novels such as [[Frank Herbert]]'s 1965 ''[[Dune (novel)|Dune]]'', [[Kim Stanley Robinson]]'s 1992 ''[[Red Mars]]'', and [[Margaret Atwood]]'s 2013 ''[[MaddAddam]]''.&lt;ref name="DeNardo2014"&gt;{{cite web |last1=DeNardo |first1=John |title=Recent Ecological Fiction |url=https://www.kirkusreviews.com/features/recent-ecological-fiction/ |publisher=Kirkus Reviews |date=23 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SFEecology"&gt;{{cite web |author=Stableford, Brian |title=Ecology |url=http://www.sf-encyclopedia.com/entry/ecology |website=The Encyclopedia of Science Fiction |date=3 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Dune'' brought ecology centre stage, with a whole planet struggling with its environment.

In the 1970s, the impact of human activity on the environment stimulated a new kind of writing, [[ecofiction]]. It has two branches: stories about human impact on nature; and stories about nature (rather than humans). It encompasses books written in styles from modernism to [[magical realism]], and in genres from mainstream to romance and speculative fiction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dwyer |first=Jim |title=Where the Wild Books are: A Field Guide to Ecofiction |date=2010 |publisher=University of Nevada Press |pages=Chapter 2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Murphy |first=Patrick D. |title=Further Afield in the Study of Nature-Oriented Literature |date=2000 |publisher=University Press of Virginia |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1978 anthology of ecofiction includes 19th and 20th century works by authors as diverse as [[Ray Bradbury]], [[John Steinbeck]], [[Edgar Allan Poe]], [[Daphne du Maurier]], [[E.

Legs reduce friction, and with legs, bilateral symmetry makes coordination easier. Sentient organisms will, Villazon argues, likely use tools, in which case they need hands and at least two other limbs to stand on. In short, a generally humanoid shape is likely, though octopus- or starfish-like bodies are also possible.&lt;ref name="ScienceFocus"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Villazon |first1=Luis |title=What are the odds that aliens are humanoid? |url=http://www.sciencefocus.com/article/nature/what-are-odds-aliens-are-humanoid |publisher=Science Focus (BBC Focus Magazine Online) |accessdate=14 June 2018 |date=16 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Optimism and pessimism===
{{further|Evolution in fiction}}
[[File:War of the Worlds original cover bw.jpg|thumb|upright|[[H. G. Wells]]'s 1898 ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' struck a pessimistic note about human evolution.]]

A major theme of science fiction and of speculative biology is to convey a message of optimism or pessimism according to the author's worldview.&lt;ref name=SFEevolution/&gt;&lt;ref name=NYT1986/&gt; Whereas optimistic visions of technological progress are common enough in [[hard science fiction]], pessimistic views of the future of humanity are far more usual in fiction based on biology.{{sfn|Parker|1977|p=80 and passim}}

A rare optimistic note is struck by the evolutionary biologist [[J. B. S. Haldane]] in his tale, ''The Last Judgement'', in the 1927 collection ''Possible Worlds''. Both [[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s 1953 ''[[Childhood's End]]'' and [[Brian Aldiss]]'s 1959 ''[[Galaxies Like Grains of Sand]]'', too, optimistically imagine that humans will evolve godlike mental capacities.&lt;ref name=SFEevolution/&gt;

The grim possibilities of Darwinian evolution with its ruthless "[[survival of the fittest]]" has been explored repeatedly from the beginnings of science fiction, as in H. G. Wells's novels ''[[The Time Machine]]'' (1895), ''The Island of Dr Moreau'' (1896), and ''[[The War of the Worlds]]'' (1898); these all pessimistically explore the possible dire consequences of the darker sides of human nature in the struggle for survival.&lt;ref name=SFEevolution/&gt; [[Aldous Huxley]]'s 1931 novel ''[[Brave New World]]'' is similarly gloomy about the oppressive consequences of advances in genetic engineering applied to human reproduction.{{sfn|Parker|1977|p=80}}

===Biological parables===
[[File:Martian Odyssey Map.jpg|260px|left|thumb|The protagonist's journey across [[Mars]] in [[Stanley Weinbaum]]'s 1934 ''[[A Martian Odyssey]]'']] 

The literary critic Helen N. Parker suggested in 1977 that speculative biology could serve as biological parables which throw light on the human condition. Such a parable brings aliens and humans into contact, allowing the author to view humanity from an alien perspective. She noted that the difficulty of doing this at length meant that only a few major authors had attempted it, naming [[Stanley Weinbaum]], [[Isaac Asimov]], [[John Brunner (novelist)|John Brunner]], and [[Ursula Le Guin]]. In her view, all four had impressively full characterizations of alien beings. Weinbaum had created a "bizarre assortment" of intelligent beings, unlike Brunner's [[crab]]like but extinct Draconians.  What united all four writers, she argued, was that the novels centred on the interactions between aliens and humans, creating deep analogies between the two kinds of life and from there commenting on humanity now and in the future.{{sfn|Parker|1977|p=63}} Weinbaum's 1934 ''[[A Martian Odyssey]]'' explored the question of how aliens and humans could communicate, given that their thought processes were utterly different.&lt;!--In Parker's view, his approach was a radical departure from the conventional bug-eyed monsters of that epoch. Instead of writing about ugly aliens who simply mirrored human characteristics, he imaginatively created an "unforgettable" cast of Martians, headed by the "remarkable" Tweel. She argued that by "vividly and believably" conveying the alienness of the Martians, involving the reader in their cultures, he transformed science fiction.{{sfn|Parker|1977|pp=64–66}} She cited the historian Samuel Moskowitz's comment that "Weinbaum's life forms, to the delight of the readers, display a psychology and sense of values if not incomprehensible, then frequently antipodal to that of earthmen. They thought differently and were motivated differently. Their entire philosophy of life was completely out of the range of human experience."--&gt;{{sfn|Parker|1977|pp=64–66}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Moskowitz |first1=Samuel |title=Introduction |work=A Martian Odyssey |publisher=Lancer Books |year=1934}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Asimov's 1972 ''[[The Gods Themselves]]'' both makes the aliens major characters, and explores [[Parallel universes in fiction|parallel universe]]s.&lt;!-- In Parker's view he carefully grounds the account by setting the first and third parts on Earth,{{efn|Which she considered much less good than the alien section.{{sfn|Parker|1977|pp=67–71}}}} and the middle part, "The Gods Themselves", in the "para-universe", enabling him to contrast the worlds and so to comment on human society and fallibility. The "parabeings" have a novel biology, "closely bound in biological and social triads that gradually merge through a series of 'meltings' into single adult beings, or 'Hard Ones'." One of each triad is the 'Emotional', who provides sensitivity and the "emotional energy" needed for a melting; one the 'Rational', who carries memories of previous meltings; and one the 'Parental', who bears the seeds of new parabeings and brings them up. Parker compares the triad to [[transactional analysis]], a then-popular approach in [[psychoanalysis]].--&gt;{{sfn|Parker|1977|pp=67–71}}
Brunner's 1974 ''Total Eclipse'' creates a whole alien world, extrapolated from terrestrial threats.&lt;!-- The planet Sigma Draconis III is dying, and its native Draconians, who have caused the damage to the planet, have become extinct. The human protagonist (Ian Macauley) has to rediscover the Draconian's social and biological systems and live as one of them to understand why they went extinct. As he does so, both the expedition members and the reader, Parker argued, speculate and reason about the interpretation of the artefacts found on the planet. The Draconians turn out to have been [[sequential hermaphroditism|sequential hermaphrodites]], first male then briefly female; and they practised [[eugenics]], breeding for intelligence and rationality. In the process, they so narrowed their [[genome]] that their [[fertility]] declined and their vulnerability to disease grew, causing their own extinction. The story simultaneously develops the microcosm of the world of the expedition crew with its window into human behaviour, enabling comparisons between the two worlds and reflection on humanity's fate.--&gt;{{sfn|Parker|1977|pp=73–76}}

Leafy sea dragon - William Buelow Gould, c1832 (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|"The leafy sea dragon" (actually [[weedy seadragon]]) from  [[William Buelow Gould]]'s ''Sketchbook of fishes'', c. 1832, used by [[Richard Flanagan]] in his 2001 novel ''[[Gould's Book of Fish]]'']]

In her 1969 ''[[The Left Hand of Darkness]]'', Le Guin presents her vision of a universe of planets all inhabited by "men", descendants from the planet [[Hain (planet)|Hain]]. In the book, the ambassador Genly Ai from the civilised [[Ekumen]] worlds visits the "backward- and inward-looking" people of Gethen, only to end up in danger, from which he escapes by crossing the polar ice cap on a desperate but well-planned expedition with an exiled Gethenian Lord Chancellor, Estraven. They are ambisexual with no fixed gender, and go through periods of [[oestrus]], called "kemmer", at which point an individual comes temporarily to function as either a male or a female, depending on whether they first encounter a male- or female-functioning partner during their period of kemmer. The invented biology reflects and exemplifies, according to Parker, the opposing but united dualities of [[Taoism]] such as light and darkness, maleness and femaleness, [[yin and yang]]. So too do the opposed characters of Genly Ai with his carefully objective reports, and of Estraven with [[Gender-neutral language|his or her]] highly personal diary, as the story unfolds, illuminating humanity through adventure and science fiction strangeness.{{sfn|Parker|1977|pp=70–77}}

===Structure and themes===

Modern novels sometimes make use of biology to provide structure and themes. [[Thomas Mann]]'s 1912 ''[[Death in Venice]]'' relates the feelings of the protagonist to the progress of an epidemic of [[cholera]], which eventually kills him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Crace |first1=John |title=Digested classics: Death in Venice by Thomas Mann |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2008/aug/30/5 |publisher=[[The Guardian]] |date=30 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Richard Flanagan]]'s 2001 novel ''[[Gould's Book of Fish]]'', which makes use of the illustrations from artist and convict [[William Buelow Gould]]'s book of 26 paintings of fish for chapter headings and as the inspiration for the various characters in the novel.&lt;ref name="MacFarlane2002"&gt;{{cite news |last1=MacFarlane |first1=Robert |title=Con fishing {{!}} Gould's Book of Fish |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/2002/may/26/fiction.features1 |accessdate=8 August 2018 |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=26 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Realism ==

The geneticist Dan Koboldt observes that the science in science fiction is often oversimplified, reinforcing popular myths to the point of "pure fiction". In his own field, he gives as examples the idea that first-degree relatives have the same hair, eyes and nose as each other, and that a person's future [[biological determinism|is predicted by their genetic code]], as (he states) in ''[[Gattaca]]''.{{sfn|Koboldt|2018|pp=4–5 and passim}} Koboldt points out that eye colour changes as children grow up: adults with green or brown eyes often had blue eyes as babies; that brown-eyed parents can have children with blue eyes, "and vice versa"; and that the brown pigment [[melanin]] is controlled by around 10 different genes, so inheritance is along a [[Genetic variability|spectrum]] rather than being a blue/brown switch. &lt;ref name="Koboldt 2015"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koboldt |first1=Dan |title=Eye-based Paternity Testing &amp; Other Human Genetics Myths |journal=Apex Magazine |date=5 May 2015 |issue=72 |url=https://www.apex-magazine.com/eye-based-paternity-testing-other-human-genetics-myths/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors in his edited collection ''Putting the Science in Fiction'' point out a wide variety of errors in the portrayal of other biological sciences.{{sfn|Koboldt|2018|pp=7–135}}

'''Classical Mongolian''' is an extinct{{cn|date=January 2013}} [[Mongolic languages|Mongolic]] language formerly used in [[Mongolia]], [[China]], and [[Russia]]. It is a standardized written language used in the 18th century and 20th centuries. Notable texts include the translation of the [[Kanjur]] and [[Tanjur]] and several chronicles roughly between 1700 and 1900.&lt;ref&gt;[[Juha Janhunen|Janhunen, Juha]] (2003): Written Mongol: 32. In: Janhunen (ed.): ''The Mongolic languages''. London: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; 

''Classical Mongolian'' sometimes refers to any language documents in [[Mongolian script]] that are neither Pre-classical (i.e. [[Middle Mongol language|Middle Mongol]] in Mongolian script) nor [[Mongolian language|modern Mongolian]].&lt;ref&gt;e.g. [http://linguistlist.org/forms/langs/LLDescription.cfm?code=cmg Linguist List entry for Classical Mongolian]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''commune''' (the French word appearing in the 12th century from [[Medieval Latin]] ''[[communia]]'', meaning a large gathering of people sharing a common life; from [[Latin]] ''communis'', things held in common)&lt;ref&gt;[[Communes of France]]&lt;/ref&gt; is an [[intentional community]] of people living together, sharing common interests, often having common values and beliefs, as well as shared [[property]], possessions, [[resources]], and, in some communes, [[employment|work]], [[income]] or [[assets]].

In addition to the communal [[economy]], [[consensus decision-making]], non-hierarchical structures and [[ecological]] living have become important core principles for many communes. There are many contemporary intentional communities all over the world, a list of which can be found at the [[Fellowship for Intentional Community]] (FIC).&lt;ref name="directory.ic.org"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://directory.ic.org/ |title=Welcome to the Intentional Communities Directory |author= |date= |work= |publisher=directory.ic.org |accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the usually larger-scale, political entities in [[communism|communist political theory]], see [[commune (socialism)|socialist communes]], which are similar but distinct social organizations.

== Categorization of communities ==
[[Benjamin Zablocki]] categorized communities this way:&lt;ref&gt;

* Alternative-family communities
* [[Coliving]] communities
* [[Cooperative]] communities
* [[Countercultural]] communities
* [[Egalitarian communities]]
* [[Political]] communities
* [[Psychological]] communities (based on [[mystical]] or [[gestalt psychology|gestalt]] principles)
* Rehabilitational communities (see [[Synanon]])
* [[Monastery|Religious communities]]
* [[Spirituality|Spiritual]] communities
* [[Experimental]] communities

Many communal ventures encompass more than one of these categorizations. Some communes, such as the ashrams of the [[Vedanta Society]] or the [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophical]] commune [[Lomaland]], formed around spiritual leaders, while others formed around political ideologies. For others, the "glue" is simply the desire for a more shared, sociable lifestyle.

== Core principles of communes ==

The central characteristics of communes, or core principles that define communes, have been expressed in various forms over the years. Before 1840 such communities were known as "communist and socialist settlements"; by 1860, they were also called "communitarian" and by around 1920 the term "intentional community"{{Citation needed|reason=please state who used or was using the phrase ie give the phrase more context because it is a lesser known term|date=October 2012}} had been added to the vernacular of some theorists. The term "communitarian" was invented by the Suffolk-born radical [[John Goodwyn Barmby]], subsequently a Unitarian minister.&lt;ref name=Encyclopedia&gt;{{cite book |last=[[Foster Stockwell|Stockwell]] |first=Foster |title=Encyclopedia of American Communes |year=1998}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the start of the 1970s, "The New Communes" author Ron E. Roberts classified communes as a subclass of a larger category of [[Utopia]]s.{{sfn|Roberts|1971}} He listed three main characteristics. Communes of this period tended to develop their own characteristics of theory though, so while many strived for variously expressed forms of [[egalitarianism]] Roberts' list should never be read as typical. Roberts' three listed items were: first, egalitarianism – that communes specifically rejected hierarchy or graduations of social status as being necessary to social order. Second, human scale – that members of some communes saw the scale of society as it was then organized as being too industrialized (or factory sized) and therefore unsympathetic to human dimensions. And third, that communes were consciously anti-bureaucratic.{{sfn|Roberts|1971}}

Twenty five years later, Dr. Bill Metcalf, in his edited book "Shared Visions, Shared Lives" defined communes as having the following core principles: the importance of the group as opposed to the nuclear family unit, a "common purse", a collective household, group decision making in general and intimate affairs.{{sfn|Metcalf|1996}} Sharing everyday life and facilities, a commune is an idealized form of family, being a new sort of "primary group" (generally with fewer than 20 people although again there are outstanding examples of much larger communes or communes that experienced episodes with much larger populations). Commune members have emotional bonds to the whole group rather than to any sub-group, and the commune is experienced with emotions which go beyond just social collectivity.{{sfn|Metcalf|1996}}

== Communes around the world ==
With the simple definition of a commune as an intentional community with 100% income sharing, the online directory of the [[Fellowship for Intentional Community]] (FIC)&lt;ref name="directory.ic.org"/&gt; lists 186 communes worldwide (17 August 2011).&lt;ref name="FICComunes"&gt;
{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these are religious institutions such as [[abbey]]s and [[monasteries]]. Others are based in [[anthroposophic]] philosophy, including [[Camphill]] villages that provide support for the education, employment, and daily lives of adults and children with developmental disabilities, mental health problems or other special needs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://articles.philly.com/2013-10-05/news/42721660_1_camphill-soltane-disabilities-communities|title=Archives - Philly.com|website=articles.philly.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many communes are part of the [[New Age movement]].

Many cultures naturally practice communal or tribal living, and would not designate their way of life as a planned 'commune' per se, though their living situation may have many characteristics of a commune.

===Germany===
In Germany, a large number of the intentional communities define themselves as communes and there is a network of political communes called "Kommuja"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.kommuja.de |title=Kommuja-Netzwerk |author= |date= |work= |publisher=kommuja.de |accessdate=28 September 2010 |language=de}}&lt;/ref&gt; with about 30 member groups (May 2009). Germany has a long tradition of intentional communities going back to the groups inspired by the principles of ''[[Lebensreform]]'' in the 19th century. Later, about 100 intentional communities were started in the [[Weimar Republic]] after [[World War I]], many had a communal economy. In the 1960s, there was a resurgence of communities calling themselves communes, starting with the [[Kommune 1]] in Berlin, followed by Kommune 2 (also Berlin) and Kommune 3 in Wolfsburg.

In the German commune book, ''Das KommuneBuch'', communes are defined by Elisabeth Voß as communities which:{{sfn|Voß|1996|pp=17–26}}

* Live and work together,
* Have a communal economy, i.e. common finances and [[community property|common property]] (land, buildings, means of production),
* Have communal decision making – usually consensus decision making,
* Try to reduce hierarchy and hierarchical structures,
* Have communalization of housework, childcare and other communal tasks,
* Have equality between women and men,
* Have low [[ecological footprint]]s through sharing and saving resources.

===Israel===
[[File:PikiWiki Israel 3560 Architecture of Israel.jpg|thumb|250px|The communal dining hall in [[Kibbutz]] [[Merom Golan]], ca. 1968–1972]]
[[Kibbutz]]im in [[Israel]], (sing., kibbutz) are examples of officially organized communes, the first of which were based on agriculture. Today, there are dozens of urban communes growing in the cities of Israel, often called [[urban kibbutz]]im. The urban kibbutzim are smaller and more anarchist.&lt;ref&gt;Horrox, James. "A Living Revolution: Anarchism in the Kibbutz Movement", pp. 87–109&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the urban communes in Israel emphasize social change, education, and local involvement in the cities where they live. Some of the urban communes have members who are graduates of [[zionism|zionist]]-[[socialism|socialist]] youth movements, like [[HaNoar HaOved VeHaLomed]], [[HaMahanot HaOlim]] and [[Hashomer Hatsair]].&lt;ref&gt;Horrox, James. "Rebuilding Israel's Utopia", ''Zeek: A Jewish Journal of Thought and Culture'', October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===

In 1831 John Vandeleur (a landlord) established a commune on his [[Ralahine|Ralahine Estate]] at [[Newmarket-on-Fergus]], [[Co. Clare]]. Vandeleur asked Edward Thomas Craig, an English socialist, to formulate rules and regulations for the commune. It was set up with a population of 22 adult single men, 7 married men and their 7 wives, 5 single women, 4 orphan boys and 5 children under the age of 9 years. No money was employed, only credit notes which could be used in the commune shop. All occupants were committed to a life with no alcohol, tobacco, snuff or gambling. All were required to work for 12 hours a day during the summer and from dawn to dusk in winter. The social experiment prospered for a time and 29 new members joined. However, in 1833 the experiment collapsed due to the gambling debts of John Vandeleur. The members of the commune met for the last time on 23 November 1833 and placed on record a declaration of "the contentment, peace and happiness they had experienced for two years under the arrangements introduced by Mr. Vandeleur and Mr. Craig and which through no fault of the Association was now at an end".&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=K7kqAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=%E2%80%9Cthe+contentment,+peace+and+happiness+they+had+experienced+for+two+years+under+the+arrangements+introduced+by+Mr.+Vandeleur+and+Mr.+Craig+and+which+through+no+fault+of+the+Association+was+now+at+an+end%E2%80%9D&amp;dq=%E2%80%9Cthe+contentment,+peace+and+happiness+they+had+experienced+for+two+years+under+the+arrangements+introduced+by+Mr.+Vandeleur+and+Mr.+Craig+and+which+through+no+fault+of+the+Association+was+now+at+an+end%E2%80%9D&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUhubVtvHMAhVqLsAKHbz0Bh4Q6AEIHTAA ''Industrial Co-operation, the Story of a Peaceful Revolution: Being the Account of the History, Theory, and Practice of the Co-operative Movement in Great Britain and Ireland: Prepared for the Co-operative Education Association''], Catherine Webb, Co-operative union, limited, 1907, p. 64&lt;/ref&gt;

===Russia===
In imperial Russia, the vast majority of Russian peasants held their land in communal ownership within a [[Mir (commune)|''mir'']] community, which acted as a village government and a cooperative.&lt;ref&gt;Энгельгардт, Александр, Письма из деревни, М., 1987&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Морозов, Юрий, Пути России. М., 1992, т. 2, гл. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The very widespread and influential pre-Soviet Russian tradition of Monastic communities of both sexes could also be considered a form of communal living. After the end of Communism in Russia, [[monastic communities]] have again become more common, populous and, to a lesser degree, more influential in Russian society. Various patterns of Russian behavior—toloka (толока), pomochi (помочи), artel' (артель)—are also based on Communal ("мирские") traditions.

===United Kingdom===
A 19th century advocate and practitioner of communal living was the utopian socialist [[John Goodwyn Barmby]], who founded a Communist Church before becoming a [[Unitarianism|Unitarian]] minister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Utopias and Utopians: An Historical Dictionary|last = Trahair|first = R.C.S|publisher = Greenwood Press|year = 1999|isbn = 0-313-29465-8|location = Westport|pages = 27–28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The UK today has several communes or [[intentional community|intentional communities]], increasing since the [[New Towns Act 1946]] to recuperate a lost sense of community at the centralization of population in Post-War New Towns such as [[Crawley]] or [[Corby]].

[[The Simon Community]] in London is an example of social cooperation, made to ease homelessness within London. It provides food and religion and is staffed by homeless people and volunteers.&lt;ref name="The Simon Community"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.simoncommunity.org.uk/ |title = The Simon Community |quote = We are a community of homeless people and volunteers living and working together in a spirit of love, acceptance, tolerance and understanding.

Granted planning permission by the Welsh Government in 2009, it has since created 9 holdings and is a central communal hub for its community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://lammas.org.uk/ |title = Lammas |quote = The Lammas project has been created to pioneer an alternative model for living on the land.

See for example Walker (1994), [[Talk:Findhorn Foundation]] and also [[Findhorn (disambiguation)]].&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;nowiki&gt; &lt;/nowiki&gt;The [[Findhorn Ecovillage]] community at The Park, Findhorn, a village in Moray, Scotland, and at Cluny Hill in Forres, now houses more than 400 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parker, Fournier, Reedy|title=The Dictionary of Alternatives: Utopian and Organization|date=2007|publisher=Zed Books|isbn=1-84277-333-X|page=100}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:American-Commune-Bedtime-Story.jpg|thumb|A young couple from an American commune reads a bedtime story. {{FFDC|1=American-Commune-Bedtime-Story.jpg|log=2009 August 31|date=May 2012}}]] --&gt;
There is a long history of communes in America (see [[Utopia#Religious utopias|this short discussion of Utopian communities]]) which led to the rise in the communes of the [[hippie]] movement—the "[[back-to-the-land]]" ventures of the 1960s and 1970s .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kanter|first=Rosabeth Moss|title=Commitment and Community: Communes and Utopias in Sociological Perspective|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HNkvPqXMbPwC&amp;pg=PA32|accessdate=March 14, 2014|date=January 1, 1972|publisher=Harvard University Press|isbn=978-0-674-14576-4|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt; One commune that played a large role in the hippie movement was [[Kaliflower Commune|Kaliflower]], a utopian living cooperative that existed in San Francisco between 1967 and 1973 built on values of free love and anti-capitalism.

[[Andrew Jacobs (journalist)|Andrew Jacobs]] of ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that "after decades of contraction, the American commune movement has been expanding since the mid-1990s, spurred by the growth of settlements that seek to marry the utopian-minded commune of the 1960s with the American predilection for privacy and capital appreciation."&lt;ref name="NYTimes 2006-06-11"&gt;{{cite news | first=Andrew | last=Jacobs | coauthors= |authorlink= | title=Extreme Makeover, Commune Edition | date=2006-06-11 | publisher=[[The New York Times Company]] | url =https://www.nytimes.com/2006/06/11/weekinreview/11jacobs.html | work =[[The New York Times]] | page =1 | accessdate = 2009-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; (See [[Intentional community]]). The [[Fellowship for Intentional Community]] (FIC) is the best source for listings of and more information about communes in the United States.

While many American communes are short lived, some have been in operation for over 50 years.  The [[Bruderhof Communities|Bruderhof]] was established in the US in 1954,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ic.org/directory/bruderhof/|title=Bruderhof - Fellowship for Intentional Community|work=Fellowship for Intentional Community|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Twin Oaks Community, Virginia|Twin Oaks]] in 1967&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.twinoaks.org/|title=Twin Oaks Intentional Community - Twin Oaks Intentional Community Home|website=www.twinoaks.org|language=en-gb|access-date=2017-11-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Koinonia Partners|Koinonia Farm]] in 1942.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.koinoniafarm.org/brief-history/|title=Brief History|work=Koinonia Farm|access-date=2017-11-11|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Twin Oaks is a rare example of a non-religious commune surviving for longer than 30 years.

===Venezuela===

{{as of|2010}}, the Venezuelan state has initiated the construction of almost 200 "socialist communes" which are billed as autonomous and independent from the government. The communes purportedly have their own "productive gardens" that grow their own vegetables as a method of [[autarky|self-supply]]. The communes also make independent decisions in regards to administration and the use of funding.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://venezuelanalysis.com/news/5123 |title=184 Communes Currently in Formation in Venezuela |author=Tamara Pearson |date= |work= |publisher=venezuelanalysis.com |accessdate=28 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The idea has been denounced as an attempt to undermine elected local governments, since the central government could shift its funding away from these in favor of communes, which are overseen by the federal Ministry of Communes and Social Protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/16595071|title=Commune-ism: Yet another method to entrench the president's power|publisher=The Economist | date=2010-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Cremation of Care''''' is an annual theatrical production written, produced and performed by and for members of the [[Bohemian Club]], and staged at the [[Bohemian Grove]] near [[Monte Rio, California]] at a small artificial lake amid a private [[Old-growth forest|old-growth]] grove of [[Sequoia sempervirens|Redwood trees]].

The dramatic performance is presented on the first night of the annual encampment&lt;ref name=Garnett36/&gt; as an allegorical banishing of worldly cares for the club members, and "to present symbolically the salvation of the trees by the club",&lt;ref name="Garnett"&gt;Garnett, 1908, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; but the secretive nature of the Bohemians, and the political power of some of its members, has been criticized.

==History==
In 1878, the [[Bohemian Club]] of [[San Francisco]] first took to the woods in [[Taylorville, California]] (present-day [[Samuel P. Taylor State Park]]) for a summer celebration that they called Midsummer High Jinks.&lt;ref&gt;Garnett, 1908, p. ix.&lt;/ref&gt; Poems were recited, songs were sung, and dramatic readings were given; the practice was repeated each summer in other areas, primarily near the [[Russian River (California)|Russian River]] in [[Sonoma County, California|Sonoma County]]. In 1881, the ceremony of the ''Cremation of Care'' was first conducted after the various individual performances, with [[James F. Bowman]] as Sire.&lt;ref&gt;Garnett, 1908, pp. 19–20.&lt;/ref&gt; The ceremony was further expanded in 1893 by a member named Joseph D. Redding,&lt;ref name=Domhoff&gt;Domhoff, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt; with a Midsummer High Jinks entitled ''The Sacrifice in the Forest'', or simply "Druid Jinks", in which brotherly love and [[Christianity]] battled and won against [[paganism]], converting the [[druid]]s away from bloody sacrifice.&lt;ref name=Garnett21&gt;Garnett, 1908, p. 21.&lt;/ref&gt; Redding formed the framework of the ceremony but the main actors, including George Tisdale Bromley as High Priest, were asked to supply their own major speeches.&lt;ref name=Garnett21/&gt; In 1904, the prologue to [[William Henry Irwin]]'s [[List of Grove Plays|Grove Play]] ''The Hamadryads'' included text such as "Touch their world-blind eyes with fairy unguents." The play depicted the intrusion, the battles, and the symbolic death of the maleficent Spirit of Care.&lt;ref&gt;Garnett, 1908, pp. 4–5.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the earliest productions of the Grove Play, several restrictions were imposed upon the Sire (the master of ceremonies&lt;ref&gt;Garnett, 1908, p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt;) including that the stage setting be the natural forest backdrop and that the "malign character Care" be introduced in the plot, to wreak havoc with the characters and then be faced down and vanquished by the hero.&lt;ref name="Garnett" /&gt; In these early productions, the ''Cremation of Care'' immediately followed, and lasted until midnight.&lt;ref&gt;Garnett, 1908, p. 27.&lt;/ref&gt; The end of the ceremony was signaled by a lively Jinks Band rendition of ''[[There'll Be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Ogden, 1990, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt; and the club members sat down to a late dinner and revelry.&lt;ref&gt;Garnett, 1908, p. 30.&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1913, the ''Cremation of Care'' was disengaged from the Grove Play, and rescheduled for the first night of the summer encampment.&lt;ref name=Garnett36/&gt; The Grove Play was set for the final weekend.&lt;ref name=Garnett36&gt;Garnett, 1908, p. 36.&lt;/ref&gt; A different Sire was appointed for the Cremation, and some concerns were raised in subsequent years that the ''Cremation of Care'' was growing into its own secondary Grove Play. Some Sires experimented with a satirical treatment, or topical themes such as a patriotic [[World War I]] treatment in 1918 and an unpopular [[Prohibition]] script in 1919. "Care" was not killed, let alone cremated, in the 1922 version. In response to member complaints about the unpredictable quality of the opening night fare, Charles K. Field was asked in 1923 to standardize the script for what became the basis for every subsequent ''Cremation of Care'' ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;Garnett, 1908, pp. 37–39.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Staging==
[[File:Owl Shrine.jpg|thumb|left|The Owl Shrine covered in moss, standing among trees behind a stage at one edge of a man-made pond.]]
The ceremony involves the poling across a lake of a small boat containing an [[effigy]] of Care (called "Dull Care"). Dark, hooded figures receive from the ferryman the effigy which is placed on an altar, and, at the end of the ceremony, set on fire. This "cremation" symbolizes that members are banishing the "dull cares" of conscience.&lt;ref name=phillips&gt;Phillips, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; At the time the script was developed, the primary meaning of the word '[[wikt:care|care]]' (&lt; O.E. ''[[wikt:cearu|cearu]]'', "anxiety, anguish") was synonymous with 'worry', having more negative connotations than in modern times when it tends to be associated more positively with compassion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://care.georgetown.edu/Classic%20Article.html "History of the Notion of Care"], ''Encyclopedia of Bioethics'' (1995)&lt;/ref&gt;

The ceremony takes place in front of the Owl Shrine, a {{convert|40|ft|m|0|adj=on}} hollow owl statue made of concrete over steel supports. The moss- and lichen-covered statue simulates a natural rock formation, yet holds electrical and audio equipment within it. During the ceremony, a recording is used as the voice of The Owl. For many years the recorded voice was club guest [[Walter Cronkite]].&lt;ref name=weiss&gt;Philip Weiss, [http://sociology.ucsc.edu/whorulesamerica/power/bohemian_grove_spy.html Masters of the Universe Go to Camp: Inside the Bohemian Grove]. ''[[Spy Magazine]]'', November 1989&lt;/ref&gt; Music and [[pyrotechnics]] accompany the ritual for dramatic effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Grove's Dictionary of Music and Musicians |volume=6 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JLEqAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA136 |page=136 |editor1=George Grove |editor2=Waldo Selden Pratt |editor3=Charles Newell Boyd |publisher=Macmillan |year=1920}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6NbOx9VMJGIC&amp;pg=PA38 |page=38 |title=Music and Politics in San Francisco: From the 1906 Quake to the Second World War |last=Miller |first=Leta E. |publisher=University of California Press |year=2011 |isbn=9780520268913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vGI51FdN_UEC&amp;pg=PA108 |page=108 |title=Hoover The Fishing President: Portrait of the Private Man and His Life Outdoors |last=Wert |first=Hal Elliott |publisher=Stackpole Books |year=2005 |isbn=9780811700993}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Music and Musicians in Bohemia: The First One Hundred Years – a Research Document |last1=Buck |first1=Richard P. |last2=Bethards |first2=Jack M. |page=389 |publisher=Bohemian Club |year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
On July 15, 2000, filmmaker [[Alex Jones (radio)|Alex Jones]] and his cameraman, Mike Hanson, infiltrated the Bohemian Grove expecting to uncover the owl statue being worshipped as [[Moloch]], with human sacrifices thrown into its fiery interior.&lt;ref name=Jones&gt;Jones, Alex. ''Dark Secrets: Inside Bohemian Grove''. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; With a hidden camera, Jones and Hanson filmed the ''Cremation of Care'' ceremony. The footage was the centerpiece of Jones' documentary ''Dark Secrets: Inside Bohemian Grove''. Jones claimed that the ''Cremation of Care'' was an "ancient [[Canaan]]ite, [[Lucifer]]ian, [[Babylon]] mystery religion ceremony". The Grove and Jones' investigation were covered by [[Jon Ronson]] in [[Channel 4]]'s four-part documentary ''[[Secret Rulers of the World]]''. Ronson documented his view of the ritual in his book ''[[Them: Adventures with Extremists]]'', writing: "My lasting impression was of an all-pervading sense of immaturity: the Elvis impersonators, the pseudo-pagan spooky rituals, the heavy drinking. These people might have reached the apex of their professions but emotionally they seemed trapped in their college years."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ronson |first=Jon |title=Them: Adventures with Extremists |publisher=Simon and Schuster |year=2002 |page=321 |isbn=0-7432-3321-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Okg6WBbMjzQC&amp;pg=PA321 |accessdate=2010-04-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Protests===
Outside of the main entrance to the Bohemian Grove, protesters against club members and their guests have held a ceremony called the "Resurrection of Care", intended to symbolically reverse the effects of the Cremation of Care, to prevent the attendees from temporarily abandoning their cares.&lt;ref name=weiss/&gt; The counter ceremony was first held in 1980, organized by Mary Moore, a former beauty queen turned left-wing activist. Moore was less concerned about the Cremation of Care ceremony than with the likelihood that club members with corporate interests would gain influence in government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/07/28/us/28land.html |title=Redwoods Hideaway for the Elite Goes On, but Protest Days Fade |last=Barry |first=Dan |date=July 27, 2010 |work=The New York Times |accessdate=June 29, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Dayne Ogilvie Prize for LGBTQ Emerging Writers''' is a [[Canada|Canadian]] literary award, presented annually by the [[Writers' Trust of Canada]] to an emerging Canadian writer who is part of the [[LGBTQ|lesbian, gay, bisexual, transgender, or queer]] community. It is one of two literary awards in Canada serving the LGBTQ community, alongside the [[Blue Metropolis Violet Prize]] for established writers.&lt;ref name=knegt&gt;Peter Knegt, [http://www.cbc.ca/arts/canadian-lgbtq-literature-is-having-a-moment-and-this-montreal-festival-is-showcasing-that-1.4623790 "Canadian LGBTQ literature is having a moment, and this Montreal festival is showcasing that"]. [[CBC Arts]], April 18, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The award was originally established by artist Robin Pacific as the '''Dayne Ogilvie Grant''' in memory of Dayne Ogilvie, a book [[Editing|editor]], writer, arts manager and former managing editor of ''[[Xtra!]]''&lt;ref name=smith&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/arts/books/story/2007/06/14/ogilvie-award-smith.html "Vancouver's Smith wins new prize for gay writers"]. [[CBC News]], June 14, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; who died in October 2006.&lt;ref name=cullen /&gt; The award was renamed from a grant to a prize in 2012.

Established in 2007, the {{currency|4,000|CAD}} prize is not presented for a specific work,&lt;ref name=canenc /&gt; although writers must have published at least one book of fiction or poetry to be eligible.&lt;ref name=canenc /&gt; The winner is selected by an independent jury of three members, and presented annually during [[Pride Toronto]].&lt;ref name=canenc /&gt;

Beginning in the prize's second year, the award introduced a preliminary shortlist of two or three writers. The writer or writers not selected as the final winner of the prize are presented with an Honour of Distinction, worth {{currency|500|CAD}} if one writer is named or {{currency|250|CAD}} each if two writers are named. Authors who are awarded the Honour of Distinction remain eligible for the primary award in future years,&lt;ref name=canenc&gt;[http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/articles/dayne-ogilvie-grant Dayne Ogilvie Grant] at [[The Canadian Encyclopedia]].&lt;/ref&gt; although to date no writer who has been awarded an Honour of Distinction has subsequently been named the primary winner.

{{PoeTopics}}
The influence of [[Edgar Allan Poe]] on the art of music has been considerable and long-standing, with the works, life and image of the [[horror fiction]] writer and poet inspiring composers and musicians from diverse genres for more than a century.

==Classical music==
[[Image:Claude Debussy ca 1908, foto av Félix Nadar.jpg|left|150px|thumb|Claude Debussy wrote an unfinished opera based on "The Fall of the House of Usher."]]

Leon Botstein, conductor of the American Symphony Orchestra—which presented a program of "Tales From Edgar Allan Poe" in 1999—noted that in the realm of [[European classical music|classical music]], as in literature, Poe's influence was felt more deeply in Europe than in America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://Europhony.org/dialogues_extensions/99_2000season/1999_10_15/schmitt.cfm Schmitt at AmericanSymphony.org]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Rhodes Project ==
The Rhodes Project, which examines the experience of female [[Rhodes Scholars]], was created in 2004 by [[Ann Olivarius]].&lt;ref name="Susan Rudy" /&gt; Rhodes Scholars are chosen from around the world for graduate study at the University of Oxford. The project showcases research on the lack of career-support networks, based on interviews and data from female Rhodes Scholars who were born in the 1950s to 1980s and who earned graduate and professional degrees until the early 2000s.&lt;ref name="Susan Rudy"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Rudy|first1=Susan|title=The Rhodes Project: Celebrating many versions of what women can be|url=http://ohrh.law.ox.ac.uk/the-rhodes-project-celebrating-many-versions-of-what-women-can-be/|website=Oxford Human Rights Club|date=November 25, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Our Mission |url=http://rhodesproject.com/mission/ |website=The Rhodes Project |accessdate=9 December 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141219113257/http://rhodesproject.com/mission/ |archivedate=19 December 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The project is interested in how this data reflects the current situation of women. One interviewee told the researchers: "It would have been helpful to really know to what extent things still haven’t changed for women.&amp;nbsp;... How I would have handled situations might have been different if I had understood what was going on behind the scenes. The blatant examples are something that you deal with but it’s the subtle things and understanding those that I would have worked through differently."&lt;ref name="Kate Blackmon and Susan Rudy"&gt;{{cite web|author1=Susan Rudy and Kate Blackmon |title='I wish I'd had a female mentor': what Rhodes Scholars say about the lack of change for women |url=http://rhodesproject.com/news-and-views/2014/10/9/i-wish-id-had-a-female-mentor-what-rhodes-scholars-say-about-the-lack-of-change-for-women |archive-url=https://archive.is/20141209074739/http://rhodesproject.com/news-and-views/2014/10/9/i-wish-id-had-a-female-mentor-what-rhodes-scholars-say-about-the-lack-of-change-for-women|website=Rhodes Project |publisher=Rhodes Project |accessdate=9 December 2014 |archivedate=December 9, 2014 |dead-url=yes |format=web }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Frank Popper''' (born April 17, 1918&lt;ref&gt;[http://catalogue.nla.gov.au/Record/751407 Art, action and participation by Frank Popper. National Library of Australia collection]&lt;/ref&gt;) is a [[historian]] of [[art]] and [[technology]] and Professor Emeritus of Aesthetics and the Science of Art at the [[University of Paris VIII]]. He has been decorated with the medal of the Légion d'honneur by the French Government.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.legiondhonneur.fr/shared/fr/promo/lh/jo100402llhcivile.html |title=Présidence de la République |access-date=2010-05-30 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100603035700/http://www.legiondhonneur.fr/shared/fr/promo/lh/jo100402llhcivile.html |archive-date=2010-06-03 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is author of the books: ''Origins and Development of Kinetic Art'', ''Art, Action, and Participation'', ''Art of the Electronic Age''&lt;ref&gt;Lieser, Wolf. ''Digital Art''. Langenscheidt: h.f. ullmann. 2009 p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; and ''From Technological to Virtual Art''. He [[centenarian|turned 100]] in April 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.leonardo.info/blog/2018/04/12/frank-popper-spirit-rector-of-kinetic-art-is-celebrating-his-100th-birthday&lt;/ref&gt;

Popper documents the historical record of the relationship between technology and participatory forms of art, especially between the late 1960s and the early 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;Christiane Paul, ''Digital Art'', Thames &amp; Hudson Ltd. p. 219&lt;/ref&gt; Sharing his focus on art and technology are [[Jack Burnham]] (''Beyond Modern Sculpture'' 1968) and [[Gene Youngblood]] (''[[Expanded Cinema]]'' 1970). They show how art has become, in Frank Popper's terms, virtualized.&lt;ref name="Virtualised Art pp. 48"&gt;[[Joseph Nechvatal]], ''Frank Popper and Virtualised Art'', Tema Celeste Magazine: Winter 2004 issue #101, pp. 48–53&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kinetic art==
In his books ''Origins and Development of Kinetic Art'' and ''Art, Action and Participation'', Popper showed how [[Kinetic Art]] played an important part in pioneering the unambiguous use of optical movement and in fashioning links between science, technology, art and the environment.&lt;ref&gt;Kristine Stiles &amp; Peter Selz, ''Theories and Documents of Contemporary Art: A Sourcebook of Artists' Writings'' (Second Edition, Revised and Expanded by Kristine Stiles) University of California Press 2012, p. 450&lt;/ref&gt; Popper has been a champion of the humanizing effects of such an interdisciplinary synthesis.

Key to his initial thinking and activities as an [[aesthetics|aesthetician]], cultural theorist, [[curator]], teacher, and [[art critic]] was his encounter in the early 1950s with the kinetic artist (and author of the book ''Constructivism''), [[George Rickey]]. He subsequently encountered the artists [[Nicolas Schoffer]] and [[Frank Malina]], whose works were based on first or second-hand scientific knowledge.  Also [[Op Art]] in the early 1960s had a powerful effect on him. Indeed, Op proved to be a strong predecessor to what he is calling '''Virtual Art''' in that Op Art called attention to the spectator's individual, constructive, and changing perceptions - and thus called upon the spectator to transfer the creative act increasingly upon him or herself. Op beckons forth a consideration of the enlargement of the audience's participatory role; both in regard to the [[perception]] of meaning and actual physical changes to the work of art. Popper also has had many personal encounters in Paris with [[Groupe de Recherche d’Art Visual]], [[Carlos Cruz-Diez]], [[Yaacov Agam]], [[Jesus-Rafael Soto]] and [[Victor Vasarely]] which proved to have had a substantial impact on his view of art and [[art history]].

==Virtual art==
Following this inclination he took interest in the works of Piotr Kowalski, [[Roy Ascott]] and many others working with the early concept of [[Social network|networking]]. These artists confirmed his interest in spectator participation, which brought him to the late 1980s and the 1990s when [[immersive virtual reality]] and [[digital art]] began to become established. Popper began to investigate a range of works emerging in this era, including that of [[Shawn Brixey]], [[Ebon Fisher]] and [[Joseph Nechvatal]]. To explain and illustrate the emergence of a techno-aesthetic Popper stresses the panoramic and multi-generational reach of virtual art. As regards to virtual art, openness is stressed both from the point of view of the artists and their creativity and from that of the follow-up users in their reciprocating thoughts and actions. This commitment to the teeming openness found in virtual art can be traced to the theories of [[Umberto Eco]] and other aestheticians. Recently Eco has expressed a consideration of the computer as a spiritual tool.&lt;ref name="Virtualised Art pp. 48"/&gt;

Popper uses the term, [[virtual art]], in reference to all the art made with the technical media developed at the end of the 1980s (or a bit before, in some cases). These include human-machine interfaces such as visualization casks, [[stereoscopic]] spectacles and screens, generators of three-dimensional sound, data gloves, data clothes, position sensors, tactile and power feed-back systems, etc. All these technologies allowed immersion into the image and [[interaction]] with it. The impression of reality felt under these conditions was not only provided by vision and hearing, but also by the other bodily senses. This multiple sensing was so intensely experienced at times, that Popper could speak of it as an [[immersive virtual reality]] (VR).
[[Image:Frank Popper 1.jpg|thumb|left|Frank Popper, 2008]]

In his book "From Technological to Virtual Art", Popper traces the development of immersive, interactive new media art from its historical antecedents through today's [[digital art]], [[computer art]], [[cybernetic art]], [[multimedia]] and [[net art]]. Popper shows that contemporary virtual art is a further refinement of the [[technological]] art of the late twentieth century - and also a departure from it. What is new about this [[new media art]], he argues, is its humanization of technology, its emphasis on [[interactivity]], its [[philosophical]] investigation of the real and the [[Virtuality|virtual]], and its multisensory nature.&lt;ref&gt;[[Margaret Boden]], Mind As Machine, [[Oxford University Press]], 2006, p. 1089&lt;/ref&gt;  He argues further that what distinguishes the artists who practice virtual art from traditional artists is their combined commitment to [[aesthetics]] and [[technology]]. Their "extra-artistic" goals - linked to their [[aesthetic]] intentions - concern not only [[science]] and [[society]] but also basic human needs and drives.

==Definition==
Defining virtual art broadly as art that allows us, through an interface with [[technology]], to immerse ourselves in [[computer art]] and interact with it, Popper identifies an aesthetic-technological logic of creation that allows artistic expression through integration with technology. After describing artistic forerunners of virtual art from 1918 to 1983 - including art that used light, movement, and [[electronics]] - Popper looks at contemporary [[new media art]] forms and artists. He surveys works that are digital based but materialized, multimedia offline works, interactive digital installations, and multimedia online works ([[net art]]) by many artists. The biographical details included reinforce Popper's idea that technology is humanized by art.&lt;ref&gt;''Origins of Virtualism: An Interview with Frank Popper conducted by [[Joseph Nechvatal]]", CAA Art Journal, Spring 2004, pp. 62-77&lt;/ref&gt;

Virtual art, he argues, offers a new model for thinking about humanist values in a technological age. Virtual art, as Popper sees it, is more than just an injection of the usual aesthetic material into a new [[:wikt:medium|medium]], but a deep investigation into the [[ontological]], [[psychological]] and [[ecological]] significance of such technologies. The aesthetic-technological relationship produces an unprecedented artform.

Once authoritatively published, a ghost word occasionally may be copied widely and take a long time to be erased from usage (if it ever is).

==Origin of the term==
The term '''ghost words''' was coined and originally presented in public by Professor [[Walter William Skeat]] in his annual address as president of the [[Philological Society]] in 1886.&lt;ref name="Ghost-words"&gt;Skeat, Walter William; Presidential address on 'Ghost-Words' in: 'Transactions of the Philological Society, 1885-7, pages 343-374'; Published for the society by Trübner &amp; Co., Ludgate Hill, London, 1887. May be downloaded at: https://archive.org/details/transact188500philuoft&lt;/ref&gt; He said in part:

{{quote|Of all the work which the Society has at various times undertaken, none has ever had so much interest for us, collectively, as the New English Dictionary. Dr Murray, as you will remember, wrote on one occasion a most able article, in order to justify himself in omitting from the Dictionary the word [[wiktionary:abacot|abacot]], defined by Webster as "the cap of state formerly used by English kings, wrought into the figure of two crowns". It was rightly and wisely rejected by our Editor on the ground that there is no such word, the alleged form being due to a complete mistake ... due to the blunders of printers or scribes, or to the perfervid imaginations of ignorant or blundering editors. ...

I propose, therefore, to bring under your notice a few more words of the abacot type; words which will come under our Editor's notice in course of time, and which I have little doubt that he will reject. As it is convenient to have a short name for words of this character, I shall take leave to call them "ghost-words." ... I only allow the title of ghost-words to such words, or rather forms, as have no meaning whatever.

...&amp;nbsp;I can adduce at least two that are somewhat startling. The first is kime ... The original ... appeared in the Edinburgh Review for 1808. "The Hindoos ... have some very savage customs ... Some swing on hooks, some run kimes through their hands&amp;nbsp;..."}}

It turned out that "kimes" was a misprint for "knives", but the word gained currency for some time. A more drastic example followed, also cited in Skeat's address:&lt;ref name="WHB"&gt;Wheatley, Henry Benjamin; Literary Blunders; A Chapter in the “History of Human Error”; Publisher: Elliot Stock, London 1893&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|A similar instance occurs in a misprint of a passage of one of [[Walter Scott]]'s novels, but here there is the further amusing circumstance that the etymology of the false word was settled to the satisfaction of some of the readers.  In the majority of editions of ''[[The Monastery]]'', we read: ''... dost thou so soon morse thoughts of slaughter?''

This word is nothing but a misprint of ''nurse''; but in ''[[Notes and Queries]]'' two independent correspondents accounted for the word ''morse'' etymologically. One explained it as ''to prime'', as when one primes a musket, from [[Old French|O. Fr.]] ''amorce'', powder for the [[touchhole]] (Cotgrave), and the other by ''to bite'' (Lat. ''mordere''), hence "to indulge in biting, stinging or gnawing thoughts of slaughter". The latter writes: "That the word as a misprint should have been printed and read by millions for fifty years without being challenged and altered exceeds the bounds of probability." Yet when the original manuscript of Sir Walter Scott was consulted, it was found that the word was there plainly written ''nurse''.}}

One example of such an edition of ''The Monastery'' was published by the Edinburgh University Press in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Scott, Walter. ''The Monastery''. Chapter 10, page 156. Published by Edinburgh University Press. 1820. https://archive.org/details/monasteryaroman00scotgoog&lt;/ref&gt;

==More examples==

In his address, Skeat exhibited about 100 more specimens that he had collected.

Other examples include:
*The supposed [[Homeric Greek]] word στήτη (''stētē'') = "woman", which arose thus: In ''[[Iliad]]'' Book 1 line 6 is the phrase διαστήτην ἐρίσαντε (''diastētēn episante'') = "two [= [[Achilles]] and [[Agamemnon]] ] stood apart making strife". However someone unfamiliar with [[Dual (grammatical number)|dual number]] verb inflections read it as διά στήτην ἐρίσαντε (''dia stētēn episante'') = "two making strife because of a ''stētē''", and he guessed that ''stētē'' meant the woman [[Briseis]] who was the subject of the strife.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.org/details/iliad01leafgoog|title=The Iliad|first1=|last1=Homer|first2=Robert|last2=Fagles|first3=Bernard MacGregor Walker|last3=Knox|date=10 September 1990|publisher=New York, N.Y., U.S.A. : Viking|via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The placename [[Old Sarum|Sarum]], which arose by misunderstanding of the abbreviation '''Sar~''' used in a medieval manuscript to mean some early form such as "Sarisberie" (= [[Salisbury, United Kingdom|Salisbury]]).&lt;ref name="Mills2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Mills|title=A Dictionary of British Place-Names|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tXucAQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA526|date=20 October 2011|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-960908-6|pages=526–}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*As an example of an editing mistake, "[[dord]]"  was defined as a noun meaning ''density'' (mass per unit volume). When the second edition of  [[Webster's New International Dictionary]] was being prepared, an index card that read "D or d" with reference to the word "density" was incorrectly misfiled as a word instead of an abbreviation. The entry existed in more than one printing from 1934 to 1947.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/video/0027-ghostword.htm?&amp;t=1359659566 "Ghost Word" with Emily Brewster], part of the "Ask the Editor" series at Merriam-Webster.com&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dord_2012"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/dord | title=dord | publisher=Dictionary.com, LLC | accessdate=February 21, 2012 | quote=In sorting out and separating abbreviations from words in preparing the dictionary's second edition, a card marked "D or d" meaning "density" somehow migrated from the "abbreviations" stack to the "words" stack.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The ''OED'' explains the ghost word '''Phantomnation''' as "Appearance of a phantom; illusion. Error for ''phantom nation''".&lt;ref&gt;''Oxford English Dictionary Second Edition on CD-ROM'', Version 4.0, Oxford University Press (2009).&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alexander Pope]]'s (1725) translation of the ''[[Odyssey]]'' originally said, "The Phantome-nations of the dead". [[Richard Paul Jodrell]]'s (1820) ''Philology of the English Language'', which omitted hyphens from compounds, entered it as one word, "Phantomnation, a multitude of spectres". Lexicographers copied this error into various dictionaries, such as, "Phantomnation, illusion. Pope." ([[Joseph Emerson Worcester|Worcester]], 1860, ''Philology of the English Language''), and "Phantomnation, appearance as of a phantom; illusion. (Obs. and rare.) Pope." ([[Noah Webster|Webster]], 1864, ''An American dictionary of the English language'').&lt;ref name="WalshWalsh1890"&gt;{{cite book|author1=William Shepard Walsh|author2=Henry Collins Walsh|author3=William H.

*The Japanese word ''kusege'' (癖毛, compounding ''kuse'' [[wikt:癖|癖]] "habit; vice" and [[wikt:毛|毛]] ''ke'' "hair", "frizzy hair") was mistranslated as '''vicious hair''' in the authoritative ''[[Kenkyūsha's New Japanese-English Dictionary]]'' from the first edition (1918) to the fourth (1974), and corrected in the fifth edition (2003) "twisted [kinky, frizzy] hair; hair that stands up".&lt;ref&gt;Watanabe Toshirō (渡邊敏郎), Edmund R. Skrzypczak, and Paul Snowden, eds. (2003), ''Kenkyusha's New Japanese-English Dictionary'' (新和英大辞典), 5th ed., Kenkyusha, 790.&lt;/ref&gt; This phantom word was not merely an unnoticed lexicographical error, generations of dictionary users copied the mistake. For example, a Tokyo hospital of cosmetic surgery had a long-running [[display advertisement]] in the Asian edition of ''[[Newsweek]]'' that read, "Kinky or vicious hair may be changed to a lovely, glossy hair" {{sic}}.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Carr (1983), "[http://barrel.ih.otaru-uc.ac.jp/bitstream/10252/1956/1/RLA_66_29-44.pdf A Lexical Ghost Story: *Vicious hair]", ''Jinbun Kenkyū'' (人文研究), 66: 29-44. Carr (p. 40) suggests "vicious hair" for ''kusege'' (癖毛) originated through [[false analogy]] from Kenkyusha's ''waraguse'' (悪癖 "bad/vicious habit; vice") entries.&lt;/ref&gt; This hair-straightening ad was jokingly used in the "Kinky Vicious" title of a 2011 Hong Kong [[iPhoneography]] photo exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;Dan Pordes, [http://travel.cnn.com/hong-kong/play/interview-liam-fitzpatrick-kinky-vicious-exhibit-892444 iPhone photos like you've never seen], [[CNN Travel]], 20 September 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[JIS X 0208]] standard, the most widespread system to handle [[Japanese language]] with computers since 1978, has entries for 12 [[kanji]] that have no known use and were probably included by mistake (for example: 彁). They are called 幽霊文字 (yūrei moji, "ghost characters") and are still supported by most computer systems (see: [[JIS X 0208#Kanji from unknown sources]]).
* [[Xiao (mythology)|Hsigo]], an apparently erroneous output from [[optical character recognition]] software for "hsiao", a creature from Chinese mythology. The typographical error appeared in several limited-audience publications but spread around the [[World Wide Web]] after the creation of a [[Wikipedia]] article about the term (which has since been corrected), due to its numerous [[Wikipedia:Mirrors and forks|mirrors and forks]].
* In his book ''[[Beyond Language: Adventures in Word and Thought]]'', [[Dmitri Borgmann]] shows how ''feamyng'', a purported [[collective noun]] for [[ferret]]s which appeared in several dictionaries, is actually the result of a centuries-long chain of typographical errors (from BUSYNESS to BESYNESS to FESYNES to FESNYNG to FEAMYNG).&lt;ref name="borgmann"&gt;{{cite book

==Speculative examples==
Many [[neologism]]s, including those that eventually develop into established usages, are of obscure origin, and some might well have originated as ghost words through illiteracy, such as the term "[[okay]]". However, establishing the true origin often is not possible, partly for lack of documentation, and sometimes through obstructive efforts on the part of pranksters. The most popular etymology of the word [[pumpernickel]] bread - that Napoleon described it as "C'est pain pour Nicole!", being only fit for his horse - is thought to be a deliberate hoax. "[[Quiz]]" also has been associated with apparently deliberate [[false etymology]]. All these words and many more have remained in common usage, but they may well have been ghost words in origin.&lt;ref name="Herbruck2008"&gt;{{cite book|author=Wendell Herbruck|title=Word Histories - A Glossary of Unusual Word Origins|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mBzvSWrLsdoC|date=November 2008|publisher=Read Books|isbn=978-1-4437-3186-7}} Available at: [https://archive.org/details/wordhistoriesagl011836mbp]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Back-formation==
A recent, incorrect use of the term "ghost word" refers to coining a new word implied logically from a real word, often etymologically incorrectly. The correct term for such a [[Derivation (linguistics)|derivation]] is [[back-formation]], a word that has been established since the late 19th century.&lt;ref name="Ghost-words"/&gt; An example is "beforemath" which is derived from "[[wiktionary:aftermath|aftermath]]". A back-formation cannot become a ghost word; as a rule it would clash with Skeat's precise definition, which requires that the word forms have "no meaning".&lt;ref name="Ghost-words"/&gt;

==Troublesome ghost words==
Ghost words and similar errors and creations, certainly including back-formations, usually are at least troublesome to philologists as a source of [[neologism]]s and linguistic confusion.&lt;ref name="Ghost-words"/&gt; More philosophically, one might as well regard them as a source of linguistic challenge and entertainment; probably most of them disappear harmlessly, and those that enter common use might well gain general acceptance simply because they express something comfortably, or otherwise meet a need. The ultimate origins of most words in any language are in essence no more respectable.&lt;ref name="White1889"&gt;{{cite book|author=Richard White|title=Words and Their Uses|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=87f7AQAACAAJ|date=1 January 1889|publisher=Richard West|isbn=978-0-8274-3741-8}} available at: [https://archive.org/details/wordstheirusespa00whit]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1284">'''Ghostlore''', '''Ghost-Lore''', or '''Ghost Lore''' is a [[folklore genre]] consisting of the [[folklore]] of [[ghost|ghosts]]. Ghostlore occurs throughout recorded history, including contemporary contexts. For example, American [[folkloristics|folklorist]] [[Louis C. Jones]] observes the following in 1944:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
Ghostlore is still widespread and popular. While most of the actions thought to be common among ghosts (chain clanking, cemetery haunting, and so forth) can be found, they are by no means so widespread in the popular ghostlore as we have been led to expect. The ghost who is very like the living is far more common than any other. ... It might be expected that a rational age of science would destroy belief in the ability of the dead to return. I think it works the other way: in an age of scientific miracles anything seems possible.&lt;Ref name="JONES-253"&gt;Jones (1944:253).&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2786">'''Global Release Day''' (alternatively known as '''New Music Fridays''') is a new set international day for releasing of music singles and albums. The new global release day went into effect on 10 July 2015 in more than 45 major recorded music markets worldwide with new music being released on a [[Friday]] as part of 'New Music Fridays'. 

The official announcement was made on 11 June 2015 by [[International Federation of the Phonographic Industry]] (IFPI), which represents the worldwide recording industry.&lt;ref name=billboard&gt;Smirke, Richard. [http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/6591060/global-release-day-launch-set-for-july "Global Release Day Launch Set for July"], ''Billboard'' magazine, June 11, 2015&lt;/ref&gt; The move means that new music will be available on the same day worldwide rather than on varying national release days, being Mondays for releases in France and the United Kingdom, Tuesdays in United States and Canada and Fridays, for example in Germany and Australia.

Music releases are now uniformly available around the world on Fridays at 00:01 local time in all 45 signatory countries. Of these, 11 countries had their release music on Fridays, while the remaining markets had to switch their day of release when the new albums and singles would become available. This move effectively ends the earlier phenomenon where new music was unavailable in one country when it was legally available elsewhere.&lt;ref name=charts&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.officialcharts.com/chart-news/global-release-day-new-music-fridays-and-the-official-chart-to-kick-off-your-weekend-from-next-month__9801/|author=Rob Copsey|title=Global Release Day: New Music Fridays and The Official Chart to kick off your weekend from next month|publisher=The Official Charts|date=10 June 2015|accessdate=10 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, in some countries, particularly in Asia, local music repertoire will still be released on different days. For instance, in Japan domestic acts will continue to release new music on Wednesdays, two days earlier than international repertoire.&lt;ref name=billboard/&gt;

The move has changed earlier traditional days where charts were being published as the official country charts try to adapt to the new "global day" for releases such that they capture a full week's sales and streaming from Friday mornings to Thursday nights. The UK Top 100, for example, published by [[Official Charts Company|The Official Charts]] moved from being published on a Sunday to a Friday with the [[BBC]] moving its new Top 40 charts program from Sundays at 4 p.m. local time to Fridays at 4 p.m. local time.

'''Intercultural Gardens''' is a project of the [[Germany|German]] Association of International Gardens (''Internationale Gärten e.V.''), resident in [[Göttingen]]. The project has the goal to further [[intercultural competence]] and [[racial integration]].

== Ideas and goals ==

[[Gardening]] and leisure activities in the specially created Intercultural Gardens are meant to promote social contacts between [[refugee]]s, [[immigrant]]s and natives. The Intercultural Gardens aim to achieve that the proclaimed solidarity with war and political refugees can be strengthened through day-to-day contacts with refugees and immigrants. Another goal is to motivate refugees and immigrants to become active and to participate. [[Garden]]s are seen as an ideal location because immigrants and refugees often come from small [[farming]] communities and were unable to apply their farming knowledge in Germany. The Intercultural Gardens consist of parcels of land on which vegetables and herbs, including herbs of the immigrants' countries of origin, can be grown and of jointly used space for children, community events and meetings.

Activities in the gardens are also seen as a foundation for further activities. For example, [[vocational training|vocational]] orientation and integration in the areas of [[garden designer|garden design]] and [[environmental movement|environmental protection]] through visits and internships in businesses in these areas. Social integration is promoted through neighborly help and family care, teaching of the [[German language]] and help in contacting educational institutions as well as documentation and public relations.

== Development to a movement ==

The projects was founded in 1996, partially on the initiative of in-migrated families. The association was founded in 1998. Initially the project had three gardens in [[Göttingen]]. In the beginning of 2006 the initial project in Göttingen had about 300 members from about twenty countries and the movement consisted of thirty independent garden projects and more were being created. The foundation ''Stiftung Interkultur'' in [[Munich]] coordinates and supports garden projects all over Germany.

'''Jesuitenmission''', the mission arm of the [[Society of Jesus]] in [[Germany]], directs its assistance to the German Jesuit foreign missions, mainly in [[India]], [[East Timor]], [[China]], and [[Zimbabwe]]. Pursuing the service of faith and promotion of justice, its works include combating poverty, refugee assistance, education, health, ecology, human rights and pastoral work, while fostering dialogue between cultures and religions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jesuitenmission.de/ueber-uns/unsere-arbeit.html|title=Unsere Arbeit|website=www.jesuitenmission.de|language=de|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.franz-xaver-stiftung.de/ueber-uns/was-tut-die-jesuitenmission.html|title=Was tut die Jesuitenmission? - Franz-Xaver-Stiftung|website=www.franz-xaver-stiftung.de|language=de|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The work extends to posting of volunteers and political advocacy, as in its campaign "Tax against poverty: FTT".&lt;ref name=onetz/&gt; A sampling of projects it has fostered and subsidized is given below.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.reportagen.de/reportagen/category/63/Projekte+der+Jesuitenmission|title=Reportagen in der Kategorie Projekte der Jesuitenmission - Reportagen.de Texte Reportagen Medienservice Journalismus|website=www.reportagen.de|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Zimbabwe==
[[File:Arnsberg Jesuitenmission.JPG|thumb|180px|right|JesuitenMission, Nuremberg]]
The Diocese of [[Chinhoyi]], founded by German Jesuits and regularly under Jesuit Bishops, provides education, health care, and social assistance for a destitute rural population. In every parish there are different groups, guilds, and small Christian communities that make up the pastoral and social network of neighborhood assistance for the sick, as well as for AIDS orphans, widows, and elderly who lack basic foodstuffs. Wells and storage tanks are also built to serve the people in this arid area of Zimbabwe.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jesuitenmission.de/projekte/projekte-in-afrika/simbabwe/bistum-chinhoyi.html|title=Überlebenshilfe im Bistum Chinhoyi|website=www.jesuitenmission.de|language=de|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current projects include a Tariro daycare and after-school care center for AIDS orphans, opened in 2003, now accommodating about 235 orphans.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jesuitenmission.de/projekte/projekte-in-afrika/simbabwe/tariro-tagesheim.html Tariro. Accessed 21 September 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jesuit Fr. Joe Arimoso founded the "Bright Stars Soccer Academy" in the small town of [[Norton, Zimbabwe|Norton]] near [[Harare]] to help young people who have family and school problems, giving them a sense of values such as fairness, teamwork, mutual responsibility, and duty. So far, 50 boys and 25 girls are registered in the Academy, and many receive support for school fees. For long-term viability, Arimoso launched a chicken farm; and a hair salon opened in which the girls can learn the craft and earn some income.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jesuitenmission.de/projekte/projekte-in-afrika/simbabwe/fussballschulen.html Football. Accessed 21 September 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt;

==China==
in 2006 Jesuitenmission was instrumental in the building of [[Casa Ricci Social Services]] in Maowangdong, a leprosy rehabilitation center, which today houses over 40 lepers. Extension services from Casa Ricci assist over 4,000 leprosy patients, including infrastructural improvements in their villages: water and electricity, roads, and schools. Casa Ricci also began a low-interest loan program for replacing mud huts with new homes. Homes for orphans, with access to education, have also been provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jesuitenmission.de/projekte/projekte-in-asien/china/lepra-und-aidshilfe/der-einsatz-des-sozialzentrums.html|title=Der Einsatz des Sozialzentrums|website=www.jesuitenmission.de|language=de|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==East Timor==
Since the end of the independence struggle in 2002, [[East Timor]] needs to see its educational infrastructure rebuilt with schools and well-trained teachers. Jesuiten assisted with the school in Kasait that opened in 2013. Since 2012, a facility for teacher training has been provided, with classrooms, library, and sports grounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jesuitenmission.de/projekte/projekte-in-asien/osttimor/schule-in-kasait.html|title=Endlich Schule!|website=www.jesuitenmission.de|language=de|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==India==
The [[Irula people|Irulars]] are the second largest indigenous tribe in the northern part of the state of [[Tamil Nadu]] with 210,000 members. Eighty-one percent of Irulars live below the poverty line and are in debt. Sixty-six percent are illiterate and often see no need in sending their children to school. But the Jesuits see education as the path to independence and human betterment. Evening schools have been set up in 25 villages to enhance the chances of success for schoolchildren. Also self-help groups have been founded for women to keep them out of the clutches of money-lenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jesuitenmission.de/projekte/projekte-in-asien/indien/gerechtigkeit-fuer-die-irulars.html|title=Ein Licht für|website=www.jesuitenmission.de|language=de|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jesuitenmission also supports a number of [[:de:Village Reconstruction Organization|Village Reconstruction Organization]] projects in India: six kindergartens (Community Child Care Program) in Lova Ponnavolu, Gunti, M. Gadaburu, Pedapachili, Kondavedi, and Chamalavaka; two vocational schools for older teens in Rajupalem and Puthur; four health programs in Chilakavanipalem, Mahatmajipuram, [[Madagam]], and [[Yercaud]]; and a tailoring course as a special program to help women in [[Kothapatnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vro-dorfbau.de/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=88&amp;Itemid=99|title=Jesuitenmission|last=Administrator|website=www.vro-dorfbau.de|language=de-de|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Kosovo==
In Loyola-Gymnasium in [[Prizren]], [[Kosovo]] boys and girls learn collaborative and responsible cooperation in the young, crisis-ridden country. Young people of diverse race and religion meet, shed prejudices, and develop friendships. The promotion of girls in this predominantly [[Muslim]] country is a special focus. In 2005 Loyola-Gymnasium was opened under the direction of Jesuit Fr. Walter Happel, S.J.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jesuitenmission.de/projekte/projekte-in-europa/kosovo/loyola-gymnasium.html|title=Loyola-Gymnasium Prizren, Kosovo|website=www.jesuitenmission.de|language=de|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cambodia==
The new Xavier Jesuit School in [[Sisophon]], [[Cambodia]], is incorporating [[kindergarten]], primary and secondary schools, teacher training, and a kind of folk high school for residents of the surrounding villages, plus tutoring and special courses for school dropouts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Jesuitenmission|title=Jesuitenschule St. Xavier in Sisophon/Kambodscha|date=2016-02-02|url=https://vimeo.com/153877633|accessdate=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jesuitenmission.de/index.php?id=1062|title=Eine neue Schule in Sisophon|website=www.jesuitenmission.de|language=de|access-date=2017-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Syria==
The [[Syrian people|Syrian]] Jesuits are supported in their local networks of assistance. Christians and Muslims visit families together, and distribute blankets, mattresses, cooking utensils, and food, while locating accommodations and teaching games to the children. Two field kitchens in [[Aleppo]] and [[Damascus]] cook daily with 16,000 meals for the families living in shelters. Due to the escalating violence some of the programs are interrupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mittelbayerische.de/region/regensburg-stadt-nachrichten/3000-euro-spende-fuer-die-jesuitenmission-21179-art1323367.html|title=3000 Euro Spende für die Jesuitenmission|last=mittelbayerische.de|work=Mittelbayerische Zeitung|access-date=2017-10-25|language=de-DE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Jon Krakauer''' (born April 12, 1954) is an American writer and [[mountaineer]], primarily known for his writings about the outdoors, especially mountain climbing. He is the author of best-selling non-fiction books—''[[Into the Wild (book)|Into the Wild]]'', ''[[Into Thin Air]]'', ''[[Under the Banner of Heaven]]'', and ''[[Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman]]''—as well as numerous magazine articles. He was a member of an [[1996 Mount Everest disaster|ill-fated expedition to summit Mount Everest in 1996]], one of the deadliest disasters in the history of climbing Everest.

== Early life ==

Krakauer was born in [[Brookline, Massachusetts]], as the third of five children of Carol Ann (née Jones) and Lewis Joseph Krakauer. His father was Jewish and his mother was a [[Unitarian Universalism|Unitarian]], of Scandinavian descent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.seattlepi.com/ae/books/article/Two-powerful-experiences-changed-the-focus-of-1120223.php | work=Seattle Post-Intelligencer | first1=John | last1=Marshall | title=Two powerful experiences changed the focus of Krakauer's book | date=July 27, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/review/?vol=16&amp;num=1&amp;id=530 |title=Maxwell Institute|publisher=Maxwellinstitute.byu.edu|accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was raised in [[Corvallis, Oregon]], from the age of two. His father introduced the young Krakauer to mountaineering at the age of eight. He competed in tennis at [[Corvallis High School (Oregon)|Corvallis High School]], and graduated in 1972. He went on to study at [[Hampshire College]] in Massachusetts, where in 1976 he received his degree in Environmental Studies. In 1977, he met former climber Linda Mariam Moore, and they married in 1980. They lived in [[Seattle, Washington]], but moved to [[Boulder, Colorado]] after the release of Krakauer's book ''[[Into Thin Air]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Krakauer's Conspicuous Silence | work = seattleweekly.com| url=http://archive.seattleweekly.com/home/930380-129/story.html | accessdate = 2017-11-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mountaineering ==

After graduating from college, Krakauer spent three weeks alone in the wilderness of the [[Stikine Icecap]] region of [[Alaska]] and climbed a new route on the [[Devils Thumb]], an experience he described in ''[[Eiger Dreams]]'' and in ''[[Into the Wild (book)|Into the Wild]]. '' In 1992, he made his way to [[Cerro Torre]] in the [[Andes]] of [[Patagonia]]—a sheer granite peak considered to be one of the most difficult technical climbs in the world.

Krakauer's most recognized climb was a guided ascent of Mount Everest that became known as the [[1996 Mount Everest disaster]]. Soon after summitting the peak, Krakauer's team met with disaster as four of his teammates (including group leader [[Rob Hall]]) perished while making their descent in the middle of a storm.

A candid recollection of the event was published in ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]'' magazine and, later, in the book ''Into Thin Air''. By the end of the 1996 climbing season, fifteen people had died on the mountain, making it the deadliest single year in Everest history to that point. This has been exceeded by the sixteen deaths in the [[2014 Mount Everest avalanche]], and the [[2015 Mount Everest avalanches|2015 earthquake avalanche disaster]] in which nineteen people were killed. Krakauer publicly criticized the commercialization of Mount Everest following this tragedy.{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

== Journalism ==

[[File:Jon Krakauer in 2009.jpg|thumb|Krakauer in 2009]]
Much of Krakauer's popularity as a writer came from his work as a journalist for ''Outside''. In November 1983, he was able to give up his part-time work as a fisherman and carpenter to become a full-time writer. In addition to his work on [[mountain climbing]], the topics he covered as a freelance writer varied greatly; his writing has also appeared in ''[[Architectural Digest]]'', ''[[National Geographic Magazine]]'', ''[[Rolling Stone]]'', and ''[[Smithsonian (magazine)|Smithsonian]].'' Krakauer's 1992 book ''[[Eiger Dreams]]'' collects some of his articles written between 1982 and 1989''.''

On assignment for ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]'', Krakauer wrote an article focusing on two parties during his ascent of Mt. Everest: the one he was in, led by [[Rob Hall]], and the one led by [[Scott Fischer]], both of which successfully guided clients to the summit but experienced severe difficulty during the descent. The storm, and, in his estimation, irresponsible choices by guides of both parties, led to a number of deaths, including both head guides. Krakauer felt the short account did not accurately cover the event, and clarified his initial statements—especially those regarding the death of [[Andy Harris (mountain guide)|Andy Harris]]—in ''Into Thin Air'', which also includes extensive interviews with fellow survivors.

== Books ==

=== ''Eiger Dreams'' ===

''Eiger Dreams: Ventures Among Men and Mountains'' (1992) is a [[non-fiction]] collection of [[article (publishing)|article]]s and [[essay]]s by Jon Krakauer on [[mountaineering]] and [[rock climbing]]. It concerns a variety of topics, from ascending the [[Eiger#Nordwand|Eiger ''Nordwand'']] in the [[Swiss Alps]], [[Denali]] in [[Alaska]] or [[K2 (mountain)|K2]] in the [[Karakoram]], to the well-known [[rock climber]]s Krakauer has met on his trips, such as [[John Gill (climber)|John Gill]].

=== ''Into the Wild'' ===

''[[Into the Wild (book)|Into the Wild]]'' was published in 1996 and spent two years on [[The New York Times Best Seller list|''The New York Times'' Best Seller List]]. The book employs a non-linear narrative that documents the travels of [[Christopher McCandless]], a young man from a well-to-do [[East Coast of the United States|East Coast]] family who, in 1990, after graduating from Emory University, donated all of the money ($24,000) in his bank account to the humanitarian charity [[Oxfam]], renamed himself "Alexander Supertramp", and began a journey in the [[Western United States|American West]]. McCandless' remains were found in August 1992; he had died of starvation near Lake Wentitika in [[Denali National Park and Preserve]]. In the book, Krakauer draws parallels between McCandless' experiences and his own, and the experiences of other adventurers. ''Into The Wild'' was adapted into a [[Into the Wild (film)|film of the same name]], which was released on September 21, 2007.

=== ''Into Thin Air'' ===

In 1997, Krakauer expanded his September 1996 ''Outside'' article into what has become his best-known book, ''[[Into Thin Air]]''. The book describes the climbing parties' experiences and the general state of Everest [[mountaineering]] at the time. Hired as a journalist by the magazine, Krakauer had participated as a client of the 1996 Everest climbing team led by Rob Hall—the team which ended up suffering the greatest casualties in the [[1996 Mount Everest disaster]].

The book reached the top of ''[[The New York Times]]''&lt;nowiki/&gt;' non-fiction [[New York Times bestseller list|bestseller list]], was honored as "Book of the Year" by ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' magazine, and was among three books considered for the General Non-Fiction [[Pulitzer Prize]] in 1998. The [[American Academy of Arts and Letters]] gave Krakauer an Academy Award in Literature in 1999 for his work, commenting that the writer "combines the tenacity and courage of the finest tradition of investigative journalism with the stylish subtlety and profound insight of the born writer. His account of an ascent of Mount Everest has led to a general reevaluation of climbing and of the commercialization of what was once a romantic, solitary sport."

Krakauer has contributed royalties from this book to the Everest '96 Memorial Fund at the Boulder Community Foundation, which he founded as a tribute to his deceased climbing partners.

In a [[Into Thin Air#Television movie|TV-movie version]] of the book, Krakauer was played by [[Christopher McDonald (actor)|Christopher McDonald]]. ''[[Everest (2015 film)|Everest]]'', a feature film based on the events of the disaster directed by [[Baltasar Kormákur]], was released in 2015.&lt;ref name=Baltasar&gt;{{cite news|last=Hopewell|first=John|title='2 Guns' Helmer Kormakur Set to Climb 'Everest'|url=https://variety.com/2013/film/international/2-guns-kormakur-set-to-climb-everest-1200574821/|accessdate=January 17, 2014|newspaper=variety.com|date=August 6, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the film, Krakauer is portrayed by [[Michael Kelly (American actor)|Michael Kelly]]. Krakauer denounced the movie, saying some of its details were fabricated and defamatory. He also expressed regret regarding Sony's rapid acquisition of the rights to the book. Director [[Baltasar Kormákur]] responded, claiming Krakauer's first-person account was not used as source material for the film, and alleged that his version of events conflicted with the plot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ew.com/article/2015/09/25/thin-air-author-jon-krakauer-not-fan-everest|title='Into Thin Air' author Jon Krakauer is not a fan of 'Everest'|author=|date=|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the book, Krakauer noted that Russian-Kazakhstani guide [[Anatoli Boukreev]], Scott Fischer's top guide on the expedition, ascended the summit without supplemental oxygen, "which didn't seem to be in [the] clients' best interest".&lt;ref&gt;Krakauer, Jon. ''Into the Air''. Anchor Books, 1999 paperback edition. p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; He also wrote that Boukreev descended from the summit several hours ahead of his clients, and that this was "extremely unorthodox behavior for a guide".&lt;ref&gt;Krakauer, Jon. ''Into the Air''. Anchor Books, 1999 paperback edition. p. 218.&lt;/ref&gt; He noted however that, once he had descended to the top camp, Boukreev was heroic in his tireless rescue attempts of the missing climbers. Five months after ''Into Thin Air'' was published, Boukreev gave his own account of the Everest disaster in the book ''[[The Climb (book)|The Climb]]'', co-written with G. Weston DeWalt.

Differences centered on what experienced mountaineers thought about the facts of Boukreev's performance. As [[Galen Rowell]] from the ''[[American Alpine Journal]]'' wrote to Krakauer, "the fact that every one of Boukreev's clients survived without major injuries while the clients who died or received major injuries were members of your party. Could you explain how Anatoli [Boukreev]'s shortcomings as a guide led to the survival of his clients…?"&lt;ref name="The Climb 267"&gt;DeWalt p.267&lt;/ref&gt; Conversely, Scott Fischer, the leader of Boukreev's team who died on the mountain, had complained continuously about Boukreev's shirking responsibility and his inability to meet the demands put upon him as the top guide—complaints documented in transcripts of radio transmissions between Fischer and his base-camp managers{{Citation needed|date=September 2017}}. After the publication of ''Into Thin Air'' and ''The Climb'', DeWalt, Boukreev, and Krakauer became embroiled in disagreements about Krakauer's portrayal of Boukreev. Krakauer had reached a {{Lang|fr|[[détente]]}} with Boukreev in November 1997, but the Russian climber was killed by an avalanche only a few weeks later while climbing [[Annapurna Massif|Annapurna]].&lt;ref&gt;Author's postscript, 1999 edition of ''Into Thin Air''.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Under the Banner of Heaven'' ===

In 2003, ''[[Under the Banner of Heaven: A Story of Violent Faith|Under the Banner of Heaven]]'' became Krakauer's third non-fiction bestseller. The book examines extremes of religious belief, specifically [[Mormon fundamentalism|fundamentalist offshoots]] of [[Mormonism]]. Krakauer looks at the practice of [[polygamy]] in these offshoots and scrutinizes it in the context of the [[Latter Day Saints]] religion throughout history. Much of the focus of the book is on the Lafferty brothers, who murdered in the name of their fundamentalist faith.

In 2006, Tom Elliott and Pawel Gula produced a documentary inspired by the book, ''Damned to Heaven''.

[[Robert Millet]], Professor of Religious Understanding at [[Brigham Young University]], an LDS institution, reviewed the book and described it as confusing, poorly organized, misleading, erroneous, prejudicial and insulting.&lt;ref name="LDSResponse"/&gt; [[Mike Otterson]], Director of Media Relations for [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS), told the [[Associated Press]], "This book is not history, and Krakauer is no historian. He is a storyteller who cuts corners to make the story sound good. His basic thesis appears to be that people who are religious are irrational, and that irrational people do strange things."&lt;ref name="LDSResponse"&gt;{{cite web | title = Church Response to Jon Krakauer's Under the Banner of Heaven | work = Newsroom | publisher = Intellectual Reserve| date = June 27, 2003 | url = http://newsroom.lds.org/ldsnewsroom/eng/commentary/church-response-to-jon-krakauer-s-under-the-banner-of-heaven | accessdate = 2009-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In response, Krakauer criticized the LDS Church hierarchy, citing the opinion of [[D. Michael Quinn]], a historian who was excommunicated in 1993, who wrote that "The tragic reality is that there have been occasions when Church leaders, teachers, and writers have not told the truth they knew about difficulties of the Mormon past, but have offered to the Saints instead a mixture of platitudes, half-truths, omissions, and plausible denials". Krakauer wrote, "I happen to share Dr. Quinn's perspective".&lt;ref name="KrakauerLDSResponse"&gt;{{cite web |last=Krakauer |first=Jon |date=July 3, 2003 |url=http://www.randomhouse.com/features/krakauer/response.html |title=A Response from the Author |accessdate=2006-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman'' ===

In the October 25, 2007 season premiere of ''[[Iconoclasts (TV series)|Iconoclasts]]'' on the [[Sundance Channel (United States)|Sundance Channel]], Krakauer mentioned being deeply embroiled in the writing of a new book, but did not reveal the title, subject, or expected date of completion. [[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday Publishing]] originally planned to release the book in the fall of 2008, but postponed the launch in June of that year, announcing that Krakauer was "unhappy with the manuscript".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20080630/4593-news-briefs.html|title=News Briefs |work=Publishers' Weekly |date=June 30, 2009 |accessdate=2010-09-19|volume=255|issue=26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The book, ''[[Where Men Win Glory: The Odyssey of Pat Tillman]]'', was released by Doubleday on September 15, 2009. It draws on the journals and letters of [[Pat Tillman]], an [[National Football League|NFL]] [[American football|professional football]] player and [[75th Ranger Regiment|U.S. Army Ranger]] whose death in [[Afghanistan]] made him a symbol of American sacrifice and heroism, though it also became a subject of controversy about the handling of the announcement of his death by the [[United States Army|U.S. Army]]. The book draws on the journals and letters of Tillman, interviews with his wife and friends, conversations with the soldiers who served alongside him, and research Krakauer performed in Afghanistan. It also serves in part as a historical narrative, providing a general history of the civil wars in Afghanistan.

Writing about the book in the [[The New York Times Book Review|''New York Times'' book review]], [[Dexter Filkins]] said that "too many of the details of Tillman’s life recounted here are mostly banal and inconsequential", but also stated, concerning Tillman's death, "While most of the facts have been reported before, Krakauer performs a valuable service by bringing them all together—particularly those about the cover-up. The details, even five years later, are nauseating to read".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/13/books/review/Filkins-t.html |title=The Good Soldier |author=Dexter Filkins |work=The New York Times |date=September 8, 2009 |accessdate=2015-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== ''Three Cups of Deceit: How Greg Mortenson, Humanitarian Hero, Lost His Way'' ===

''[[Three Cups of Deceit]]'' is a 2011 e-book that purports to expose mismanagement and accounting fraud committed by [[Greg Mortenson]], the humanitarian who built schools in Pakistan and Afghanistan; and his charity, the [[Central Asia Institute]]. It was later released in paperback by [[Random House|Anchor Books]].

=== ''Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town'' ===

''Missoula: Rape and the Justice System in a College Town'' (2015) explores how rape is handled by colleges and the criminal justice system. The book follows several case studies of women raped in [[Missoula, Montana]], many of them linked in some way to the [[University of Montana]]. Krakauer attempts to illuminate why many victims do not want to report their rapes to the police, and he criticizes the justice system for giving the benefit of the doubt to assailants but not to victims. Krakauer was inspired&lt;ref name=NYTRape&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2015/05/03/books/review/jon-krakauers-missoula-about-rape-in-a-college-town.html|accessdate=July 25, 2015|title=Jon Krakauer's 'Missoula,' About Rape in a College Town|newspaper=New York Times|date=May 3, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; to write the book when a friend of his, a young woman, revealed to him that she had been raped.

[[Emily Bazelon]], writing for the ''New York Times'' Book Review, gave the book a lukewarm review, criticizing it for not fully exploring its characters or appreciating the difficulty colleges face in handling and trying to prevent sexual assault.&lt;ref name=NYTRape/&gt; "Instead of delving deeply into questions of fairness as universities try to fulfill a recent government mandate to conduct their own investigations and hearings – apart from the police and the courts – Krakauer settles for bromides," Bazelon wrote. "University procedures should 'swiftly identify student offenders and prevent them from reoffending, while simultaneously safeguarding the rights of the accused,' he writes, asserting that this 'will be difficult, but it's not rocket science".

== ''Three Cups of Deceit'' controversy ==

Krakauer was featured during a [[CBS]] ''[[60 Minutes]]'' report on April 17, 2011 where ''60 Minutes'' reporter [[Steve Kroft]] raised questions about humanitarian [[Greg Mortenson]] and the non-profit Central Asia Institute (CAI). Krakauer questioned the accuracy of events in Mortenson's book ''[[Three Cups of Tea]]'' and whether Mortenson was kidnapped by the Taliban in 1996 as described in his second book, ''[[Stones into Schools]]''. Krakauer went on to question Mortenson's credibility through the financial practices of CAI. Krakauer had been a financial supporter of Mortenson's work and had previously donated $75,000 before becoming disillusioned with him and his management of CAI.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2011/04/15/60minutes/main20054397.shtml?tag=contentMain;contentBody,|title=CBS News 60 Minutes|publisher=Cbsnews.com|accessdate= April 17, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''60 Minutes'' story largely retraced the conclusions Krakauer came to as described in his e-book, ''[[Three Cups of Deceit|Three Cups of Deceit – How Greg Mortenson, Humanitarian Hero, Lost His Way]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://byliner.com|title=Byliner|publisher=Byliner.com|accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The e-book was released the day after the ''60 Minutes'' piece aired.

Scott Darsney, a respected mountaineer and friend of Greg Mortenson, wrote a response to Krakauer's allegations that was published as an exclusive article in ''[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]'' magazine's online version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://outsideonline.com/adventure/travel-ga-scott-darsney-greg-mortenson-three-cups-of-deceit-response-sidwcmdev_155822.html|title=Scott Darnsey Outside Magazine exclusive|publisher=Outsideonline.com|accessdate=2014-02-20|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110607165326/http://outsideonline.com/adventure/travel-ga-scott-darsney-greg-mortenson-three-cups-of-deceit-response-sidwcmdev_155822.html|archivedate=June 7, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Darnsey's response questioned the accuracy and fairness of both the Krakauer piece and the ''60 Minutes'' report. He further stated that Krakauer either misquoted or misunderstood what he said when interviewed by the author.  Darnsey went on to say that Krakauer took Mortenson's experiences in Afghanistan and Pakistan out of context and added, "If Jon Krakauer and some of Greg's detractors had taken the time to have three or more cups of tea with Greg and others—instead of one cup of tea with a select few who would discredit him—they would have found some minor problems and transgressions. But to the extent to call it all 'lies' and 'fraud'? No way." Darnsey stated in reference to the possibility that Mortenson has been dishonest in his financial dealings through CAI, "If Greg is misappropriating funds, then show me the luxury cars, fancy boats, and closets full of shoes. This is not a "ministry" or a business gone corrupt." The ''Outside'' article also touched on the allegations that Mortenson lied about being held captive by the Taliban. In light of that controversy, Darnsey stated, "Greg recounted to me his imprisonment in Waziristan when I met him in Beijing. I don't doubt that he was held against his will." Darnsey's article went on to say that Krakauer is a respected journalist and a "stickler for details and getting the facts straight", but that he felt "the research needs to continue".

In February 2012, it was reported that an investigation by the [[Montana Attorney General]] was underway.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The Trials of Greg Mortenson|author=[[Alex Heard]]|url=http://www.outsideonline.com/outdoor-adventure/celebrities/greg-mortenson/The-Trials-of-Greg-Mortenson.html|work=[[Outside (magazine)|Outside]]|date=February 12, 2012|accessdate=February 13, 2012|quote=Mortenson still isn't talking. But the case is heating up, with important developments in the lawsuit and hints that the A.G.'s probe could go badly for CAI.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 5, 2012, the Montana Attorney General's office released a report noting financial "missteps" by CAI and Greg Mortenson. The Attorney General reached a settlement for restitution from Mortenson to CAI in excess of $1&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://doj.mt.gov/wp-content/uploads/2012_0405_FINAL-REPORT-FOR-DISTRIBUTION.pdf|title=Montana Attorney General's Investigative Report of Greg Mortenson and Central Asia Institute |date= April 5, 2012|quote=We entered into a settlement agreement with Mortenson and CAI which guarantees in excess of $1&amp;nbsp;million in restitution from Mortenson for his past financial transgressions|publisher=Doj.mt.gov|accessdate=2014-02-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the May 3, 2013 issue of ''The Los Angeles Times'', the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco upheld the 2012 federal dismissal by Judge Samuel Haddon in Montana, stating he had ruled in accordance to the laws and rules governing class action suits.&lt;ref name="latimes1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2013/oct/11/entertainment/la-et-jc-fraud-suit-against-greg-mortenson-3-cups-of-tea-rejected-20131010 |title=Fraud suit against Greg Mortenson's '3 Cups of Tea' rejected – Los Angeles Times |publisher=Articles.latimes.com |date=October 11, 2013 |accessdate=2014-02-20 |first=Carolyn |last=Kellogg}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haddon ruled correctly that readers were not entitled to financial compensation based on any of the arguments presented by the plaintiffs. The suit was filed days after the publication of the above titled book, as well as the "60 Minutes" presentation.&lt;ref name="latimes1"/&gt;

According to Central Asia Institute's Board chairman, Steve Barrett, announced on October 9, 2013, that the CAI and Mortenson have fully complied with all the specific actions and repayments as negotiated by the settlement with then Attorney General (now Governor) [[Steve Bullock (American politician)|Steve Bullock]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ikat.org/2013/10/09/october-09-2013-federal-appeals-court-affirms-dismissal-of-case-against-cai-and-mortenson/ |title=Central Asia Institute " October 9, 2013: Federal appeals court affirms dismissal of case against CAI and Mortenson |publisher=Ikat.org |date=October 9, 2013 |accessdate=2014-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141223200546/http://www.ikat.org/2013/10/09/october-09-2013-federal-appeals-court-affirms-dismissal-of-case-against-cai-and-mortenson/ |archivedate=December 23, 2014 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Journalists Jennifer Jordan and Jeff Rhoads began investigating the claims against Mortenson and made a 2016 documentary ''3000 Cups of Tea''. In the film and interviews Jordan claims that the accusations against Mortenson put forward by ''60 Minutes'' and Jon Krakauer are largely not true. Jordan said in 2014: "We are still investigating this story. So far, our findings are indicating that the majority of the allegations are grossly misrepresented to make him appear in the worst possible light, or are outright false. Yes, Greg is a bad manager and accountant, and he is the first to admit that, but he is also a tireless humanitarian with a crucially important mission."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.3000cupsoftea.org/about-the-film.php | title=About the Film | work=3000 Cups of Tea | accessdate=December 9, 2017 | author=Jennifer Jordan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="3000 Cups of Tea Interview"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.explorersweb.com/everest_k2/news.php?url=3000-cups-of-tea_1396643715 | title=Greg Mortenson's Saga Not Over Yet: ExWeb Interview with "3000 Cups of Tea" Producers | publisher=ExplorersWeb | date=April 15, 2014 | accessdate=December 9, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==About==
Shortly after the Jonas Brothers guest starred on the ''[[Hannah Montana]]'' episode "[[Me and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas and Mr. Jonas]]", development for a TV series and [[Disney Channel Original Movie]] called ''[[Camp Rock]]'' starring the Jonas Brothers began.

The original concept for the TV series was about the band playing concerts as a [[undercover|cover]] while working as government [[espionage|secret agents]] to save the world and was entitled ''Jonas'' (an [[acronym]] which stood for "Junior Operatives Networking as Spies"). At the same time, they tried to hide their double lives from their mother and Frankie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-jonas2-2009may02,0,4301397.story| title=Jonas| author=Robert Lloyd| publisher=LATimes.com|date=May 2, 2009 |accessdate=2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, Stella, ignorant of the Jonas' double lives, dated each of the famous brothers without informing the others and reported the details in her [[teen magazine]] [[column]]. Said Staub, "So pretty much the entire show, it's all of us lying to each other, and kind of everything backfiring, and us getting caught in awkward situations."&lt;ref name="radiofreestaub" /&gt; She described the concept as, "like ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'' and a little of bit of ''[[Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith (1996 TV series)|Mr. &amp; Mrs. Smith]]''. There's going to be fun action sequences and still be a sitcom".&lt;ref name=radiofree /&gt;

The ''Jonas'' pilot was shot in 2007, but the [[2007–2008 Writers Guild of America strike]] impeded progress.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.roanoke.com/extra/wb/151404 Roanoke.com] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120908133459/http://www.roanoke.com/extra/wb/151404 |date=September 8, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Disney Channel Asia aired it during the Sneak Peak 2008. Instead, Disney Channel filmed a mini [[reality show]], the 2008 [[List of Disney Channel Original Series#Disney Channel Short Shows|Disney Channel Original Short Series]] ''[[Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream]]'', which followed the Jonas Brothers on a concert tour and premiered May 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Jonas Brothers: Living the Dream | url=http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tv/jonas-brothers-living-the-dream/EP01058570 | publisher=zap2it.com | accessdate=2009-05-17 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090523082116/http://tvlistings.zap2it.com/tv/jonas-brothers-living-the-dream/EP01058570 | archive-date=May 23, 2009 | dead-url=yes | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; A few weeks later on June 20, 2008, the Disney Channel Original Movie ''[[Camp Rock]]'', in which the brothers starred as the fictional band "Connect 3", debuted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Jonas reality show: The episodes! | url=http://www.tigerbeatmag.com/dailydish/jonas-brothers/2008/05/13/jonas-reality-show-the-episodes/ | publisher=TigerBeatmag.com | date=May 13, 2008 | accessdate=2009-05-17 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090612011315/http://www.tigerbeatmag.com/dailydish/jonas-brothers/2008/05/13/jonas-reality-show-the-episodes/ | archivedate=June 12, 2009 | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jonas Brothers also released ''[[Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience]]'', a [[Disney Digital 3-D]] concert film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/films.php?id=44747|title=Jonas Brothers: The 3D Concert Experience|date=June 4, 2014|work=ComingSoon.net|accessdate=2014-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; "After this rush of releases, the Jonas Brothers became too popular to imagine them as anything but more dramatic versions of themselves," explained executive producer [[Michael Curtis (TV producer)|Michael Curtis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/tv/44149057.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O:DW3ckUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUUsZ|title=Television: Jonas Brothers channel inner Monkees|publisher=|accessdate=2014-12-08|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141210203216/http://www.startribune.com/entertainment/tv/44149057.html?elr=KArksLckD8EQDUoaEyqyP4O:DW3ckUiD3aPc:_Yyc:aUUsZ|archive-date=December 10, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The spy concept was very big and very ambitious and it started to not feel quite right. As the band got bigger and bigger, doing a show that captured more of their real lives and trying to turn that into a more grounded, real version of what they might be doing became more interesting to do and more fun to do.".&lt;ref name="northjerseyjonas"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.signonsandiego.com/stories/2009/may/01/lz1c01jonas185957-disney-backing-them-again-jonase/?&amp;zIndex=91703|title=Disney backing them up again; Jonases promoted into a sitcom|work=U-T San Diego|accessdate=2014-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; "It is now about us being a band and balancing a normal life," Nick Jonas told Access Hollywood.&lt;ref name="buddytv.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.buddytv.com/articles/jonas/jonas-brothers-hit-the-small-s-26154.aspx?pollid=3001630&amp;answer=3005551#poll3001630|title=Jonas Brothers Hit the Small Screen with J.O.N.A.S., SNL Appearance|publisher=|accessdate=2014-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; The title of the series changed from ''J.O.N.A.S.'' to ''JONAS'', dropping the acronym but remaining in all capitals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/news/la-et-jonas2-2009may02,0,4301397.story|title='Jonas'|work=Los Angeles Times|accessdate=2014-12-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Producers have drawn connections between ''Jonas'' and productions by earlier bands. Show creator and producer [[Roger S. H. Schulman]] claims that "It's hard not to make parallel comparisons to [[The Beatles]] in 1962 and 1963 when you see the kind of response that the Jonas Brothers' fans have to them," and describes the 1964 ''[[A Hard Day's Night (film)|A Hard Day's Night]]'' and 1965 ''[[Help! (film)|Help!]]'' as "very much a template" for the series.&lt;ref name="northjerseyjonas"/&gt; Producers and critics have also compared the series to ''The Monkees'', a popular but short-lived mid-1960s television comedy also following a real life band. At the Television Critics Association winter press tour in January 2009, [[Gary Marsh]], entertainment president of Disney Channel Worldwide, described ''Jonas'' as a cross between ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'' and ''[[Flight of the Conchords (TV series)|Flight of the Conchords]]''.&lt;ref name="northjerseyjonas" /&gt; The ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' remarks that Joe Jonas parallels "goofy [[Micky Dolenz]]", Kevin Jonas "quirky [[Michael Nesmith]]", and Nick Jonas "dreamy [[Davy Jones (musician)|Davy Jones]]".&lt;ref name="suntimespaige"&gt;{{cite news |title = Here they come, walkin'down the (same old) street |first = Paige |last = Wiser |newspaper = [[The Chicago Sun-Times]] |date = April 30, 2009 |page = 22 |accessdate = 2010-10-20 |url = http://blogs.suntimes.com/tv/2009/04/jonas_review_better_than_hanna.html &lt;!-- http://www.suntimes.com/lifestyles/wiser/1550662,CST-FTR-jonas30.article--&gt; |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20090903215424/http://blogs.suntimes.com/tv/2009/04/jonas_review_better_than_hanna.html |archivedate = September 3, 2009 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jonas Brothers reportedly watched episodes of ''[[The Partridge Family]]'' and ''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'' "for literally three days straight" for inspiration.&lt;ref name="buddytv.com"/&gt;

==Characters==
[[Image:Lucasjonas.jpg|thumb|250px|Cast of ''Jonas L.A.'']]

===Main===
* Joseph "Joe" Lucas ([[Joe Jonas]])&lt;ref name=repetida_1 /&gt; – Joe is known as the teen heartthrob of the group. He performs lead vocals, as well as keyboards and the rhythm guitar for the brothers' band, JONAS. Girl crazy and flirtatious, Joe will go to any length to get a girl to like him. He is shown to be the most superficial and appearance oriented member of the band, and is obsessed with his hair. Joe tends to be goofier than Nick, but is not quite as quirky as Kevin. Joe likes stuffed animals that make noises. His pockets and backpack are [[hammerspace|seemingly bottomless]] and capable of holding comically large quantities. He always carries a blue panda pencil with him. Joe and Stella – the brothers' childhood friend and band's stylist – are shown to have mutual romantic feelings for one another from the beginning, but both agree that they will not go out, as a potential break-up could ruin both their longtime friendship and working relationship. However, this agreement does nothing to quash Joe's crush on Stella, and he often flirts with her and tries to spend as much time with her as possible. Near the end of season 1, in the episode "Double Date", Joe and Stella kiss, resolving their romantic tension. They soon decide to become a couple. When the brothers move to Los Angeles, Joe decides to spend his time exploring a career in acting and the film industry. He lands a role in a movie with famous actress Vanessa Page. In the first episode of season 2, "House Party", Stella witnesses Joe hugging Vanessa, which hurts her and leads to her telling Joe that she'd rather they stay friends. Following the breakup, Joe becomes very jealous when Ben asks Stella out and she accepts. Joe then decides to pursue Vanessa. With Stella dating Ben and Joe dating Vanessa, they still have feelings for one another – however, both parties are oblivious to this fact. Joe eventually breaks up with Vanessa after discovering that she dislikes Stella, whom he loves. At the end of the series, he and Stella reunite as a couple, after they both finally become aware of their feelings.
* Kevin Percy Lucas ([[Kevin Jonas]])&lt;ref name=repetida_1&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.disneychannelmedianet.com/web/showpage/showpage.aspx?program_id=3118744&amp;type=lead |title=Disney Channel Medianet |publisher=Disney Channel Medianet |accessdate=2010-11-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101123022106/http://www.disneychannelmedianet.com/web/showpage/showpage.aspx?program_id=3118744&amp;type=lead |archive-date=November 23, 2010 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; – Kevin is the oldest of the brothers, and is usually seen as wild and goofy. Kevin is known to think outside of the box, and likes to imagine wacky animals, such as an otter that can play the trumpet and a bear in a bikini. Kevin often comes up with plans that are insane or impossible, which can make him look naïve and unintelligent. However, he shows glimpses of profound thoughts and intellect, and sometimes comes up with genuinely good ideas. Kevin is shown to be very honest, as he's a poor liar; when he lies, his voice becomes comically high-pitched. He owns a full moving rack of guitars, and likes woodland creature stuffed animals. He plays lead guitar and does backup vocals in the brothers' band JONAS, though he once performed lead vocals. He had a crush on a girl that he met in [[Scandinavia]] and, when that romance didn't work out, fell for another girl from [[France]], which suggests that he has an affinity for foreign girls. He is more of a risk taker than his brothers. Despite sometimes having a bit of a rivalry (like when they're both vying to get a spot in [[Justin Timberlake]]'s ping-pong tournament), Nick and Kevin are very close. He also enjoys filmmaking, which is shown in "Direct to Video", where Kevin very much wants to direct the band's new music video. His middle name, Percy, is revealed by Joe in the series finale.
* Nicholas "Nick" Lucas ([[Nick Jonas]])&lt;ref name=repetida_1 /&gt; – Nick is portrayed as being the calm and collected member of the band. He has many short-lived relationships, and his family has criticized him for falling in love too fast. Nick is much more serious than his brothers, sometimes losing his patience with Kevin's silly antics. Nick likes stuffed animals that swim. Nick is the drummer for JONAS. When he was a baby, according to his family, he never smiled – Nick claims he was waiting for his teeth to come in (however, when Joe asks what his excuse is now, he does not have a response). Nick is also the mastermind of creative plans gone awry, and can keep a level head amid chaos. He is also seen baking many times in the show; Kevin is unable to resist his blue cookies. In season 2, he develops a relationship with Macy Misa, being smitten by her transformation into a different and more relaxed person who no longer acts like a rabid fangirl to the band. His moments with Macy tend to get interrupted by DZ, to humorous effect. In "The Secret", Nick is forced to watch over Big Man's niece, Kiara ([[China Anne McClain]]), who is aware that he and Macy are dating. In exchange for her silence about their relationship, Nick begrudgingly agrees to do a collaboration with her. He ends up telling the rest of the friends about his relationship through the song that he and Kiara made. Nick is seen to be very thoughtful, and makes a handmade mug for Macy for their one-month anniversary, after learning from Kevin that she likes homemade gifts.
* Stella Malone ([[Chelsea Kane Staub]])&lt;ref name=repetida_1 /&gt; – Stella is Jonas's stylist. She is best friends with Macy and is the brothers' childhood friend – she has known the boys since she was three. Stella and Joe both know that they like one another, but don't date, as they don't want a potential breakup to ruin their friendship. However, she gets jealous if she sees Joe with another girl, which was shown when she thought Joe and Macy were dating. Stella created an automated outfit selector called the StellaVator, and is constantly trying to adapt clothes to Jonas's hectic lifestyle. She gets annoyed when her outfits get ruined, which happens a lot more than she'd like. She is addicted to texting, and always has her phone on her. Stella also tries her best to help Macy talk to Jonas normally, instead of like an obsessed fangirl. Unlike her best friend Macy, who is a great athlete, Stella is horrible at sports. She is, however, an excellent seamstress, and once created a dozen girls' volleyball uniforms with very little notice. In the episode "Double Date", Joe and Stella kiss, and soon become a couple. However, at the beginning of season 2, she sees Joe hugging Vanessa Page, and assumes that they are romantically involved. The incident with Vanessa makes her decide that she only wants to be friends with Joe, rather than be in a relationship. While hiking with Macy, she meets a boy named Ben, whom she goes out with, much to Joe's disappointment. In the episode "America's Sweethearts", Stella is jealous when Joe's producer asks him to kiss Vanessa. After Joe says that he likes Vanessa, she lies to him, saying that Vanessa doesn't like him back. Stella feels guilty, and admits that she lied. Joe and Vanessa date, and Stella tries her best to not be jealous and spends time with Ben. Neither Joe nor Stella have lost their feelings for one another, however, after Vanessa tells Joe that she doesn't like Stella, Joe breaks up with her. After finally realizing that they both love one another, Stella and Joe become a couple in the series finale.
* Macy Misa ([[Nicole Gale Anderson|Nicole Anderson]])&lt;ref name=repetida_1 /&gt; – Macy is Stella's best friend, as well as the president of JONAS's fan club. In season 1, whenever she approaches the members of Jonas, she becomes incredibly nervous and excited, and either faints or accidentally injures them. She commonly steps on the boys' feet, or hits them in the head with her sports equipment. She often refers to each boy as "(first name) of JONAS." When she dates a boy, Randolph, she tries to make him into a JONAS member, even calling the boy "Nick" as a "nickname". Macy is very athletic, and plays on a number of sports teams. She also works in her mother's thrift store, called Misa's Pieces. Macy is revealed to be [[Tone deafness|tone deaf]], so much so that, according to Stella, they once called [[Animal Control]] under the belief that Macy's singing was an injured [[manatee]] at a softball game. Macy's obsessed fangirl attitude about Jonas changes into a real friendship with the boys late in season 1, as she begins to see them as people rather than popstars. In the episode "Frantic Romantic", she and Stella attend a Hollywood Private Party with the boys. In season 2, Macy is shown to have greatly changed, no longer being a crazy fan. This different attitude and the appearance of her real personality intrigues Nick, who eventually falls for her. Her moments with Nick tend to get interrupted by DZ, to a comical effect. In the episode "The Secret", it officially shows that Macy and Nick are dating – however, they want to keep their relationship a secret. It is revealed in a later episode that she has many brothers, and they are a big golfing family. It is also revealed that her mother taught her to play golf and her family only gives handmade gifts. Nick tries to please Macy by making her a mug for their one-month anniversary. Nick and Macy's relationship is eventually revealed, and by the end of the series, they are openly dating and happy with each other.
*Thomas “Tom” Lucas ([[John Ducey]]; main, season 1; guest, season 2) – Joe, Nick, Kevin, and Frankie's father, as well as the manager of Jonas. He is sometimes the voice of reason when his boys have crushes on girls. In his downtime, he often plays hide and seek with Frankie. He is usually nervous when famous people interview the band. It is also shown that he likes woodland creature stuffed animals that can swim and make noises, which are combinations of his son's favorite toys. He is a main character in season 1. In season 2, he appears as a guest in one episode.

===Recurring===
* Frankie Lucas  ([[Frankie Jonas]]) – Frankie is the youngest Lucas brother. He is constantly trying to get in the Jonas spotlight. Frankie hopes to get a chance to perform with the band, but his brothers don't think that is likely. Frankie can move very fast, and is an expert at hide-and-seek. He's also very skilled in getting his way. He was raised in New Jersey, and enjoys playing ping-pong. He has a crush on Macy, and was briefly mad at Nick for dating her, even going to lengths to try and "steal" her.
* Big Man ([[Robert Feggans|Robert "Big Rob" Feggans]]) – He is the bodyguard who escorts the band everywhere. He is seen to live with the boys in L.A. He has a niece, Kiara.

'''Season 1'''
* Sandy Lucas ([[Rebecca Creskoff]]) – She is the mother of Kevin, Joe, Nick, and Frankie, and is Tom's wife. She's down to earth and always proud of her sons, despite their mistakes. Mrs. Lucas just wants to have a normal family, but has acknowledged that it may not be possible with famous children. She is mostly an off-screen character.
* Van Dyke Tosh ([[Chuck Hittinger]]) – He is Stella's occasional love interest, who habitually makes Joe jealous. Van Dyke asks Stella on a date in the episode "Double Date", which causes Joe to crash their date.
* Mrs. Snark (Tangelina Rouse) – The biology/drama teacher who loves Joe, Nick, and Kevin. Much to Joe's chagrin, she often gives them preferential treatment in school, sometimes causing tension between the boys and other students. Her niece is a huge Jonas fan.

'''Season 2'''
* Dennis Zimmer "DZ" ([[Adam Hicks]]) – A new friend who the band meets while in L.A. He is the son of a very wealthy and successful record producer. He shows the band the "hot spots" in Los Angeles. He is very fun and outgoing. He is also an aspiring rapper, and tries to get his father to listen to his songs but can never get the chance.
* Vanessa Paige ([[Abby Pivaronas]]) – A popular actress who co-stars with Joe in a big-time film, "Forever April". She is also briefly his girlfriend on the show, until he breaks up with her because she dislikes Stella.
* Lisa Malone (Beth Crosby) – Stella's aunt who Stella and Macy stay with while residing in Los Angeles. She doesn't want them to date rock stars, as she made the mistake of dating rock stars twelve times. She appears in nearly all of the episodes in season 2, despite not being a main character.
* Mona Klein ([[Debi Mazar]]) – The director of "Forever April". In "Up in the Air", after Joe and Vanessa break up, Mona gives some advice to Joe, saying "when you find something real, never let it go".
* Kiara Tyshanna ([[China Anne McClain]]) – The niece of Big Man. She is the first one to find out about Nick and Macy dating.

The game was not well received, mainly due to shoddy graphics and bad gameplay, as stated on IGN, only earning an average score of 4.0 (out of ten.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= Jack DeVries |url=http://ds.ign.com/articles/105/1053811p1.html |title=Jonas Review - Nintendo DS Review at IGN |publisher=Ds.ign.com |date=December 9, 2009 |accessdate=2010-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Reception ==

=== Critical reception ===
''Jonas'' received mixed to negative reviews for its premiere. Ken Tucker of ''Entertainment Weekly'' called the show "''[[The Monkees (TV series)|The Monkees]]'' for [[Generation Y|millennials]]" and enjoyed the featured Jonas Brothers music. [[Variety (magazine)|''Variety'']] magazine reviewer Brian Lowry believed that Jonas Brothers' adorers would be pleased with the result, and that those who are not fans would still find an amiable charm within the series.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url = http://www.variety.com/review/VE1117940160.html |title = Jonas |first = Brian|last = Lowry|date = May 1, 2009|accessdate=2010-10-20|newspaper = Daily Variety Gotham}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paige Wiser of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' found the series better than ''Hannah Montana'', but commented that Nick Jonas's reserved nature made him the weak link of the premiere episode and that the boys' amateur acting is "endearing until they play a scene opposite someone with real comedic timing – like [[John Ducey]]."&lt;ref name="suntimespaige"/&gt; ''The New York Times''' John Carmanica was also disappointed with Nick's performance, particularly because, according to Carmanica, he gives off the savviest air in the band's off screen life. Carmanica also criticizes the series' script as blithe, unfunny, and "seeded with profound cynicism", but praised the believable fraternal interactions and Kevin Jonas's acting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | title = The Private Lives of Pop Stars, Male Division| first = Jon | last = Caramanica | department = The Arts/Cultural Desk; SECTC | page = 3 | date = May 2, 2009 | accessdate=2010-10-20 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/02/arts/television/02jona.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Viewer reception ===
The series was the first series on Disney Channel to premiere on a Saturday night, part of a deliberate strategy by Disney to open up the night to original programming and compete with Nickelodeon's traditional dominance of the evening.&lt;ref name="lajtracker" /&gt; The show was paired with the established series ''[[Wizards of Waverly Place]]'', which moved from a Sunday early evening timeslot, in the 8 p.m. (Eastern Time) slot. The series debuted on Disney Channel on May 2, 2009,&lt;ref name="Margaret Lyons"/&gt; and drew a solid 4.00&amp;nbsp;million viewers in the US,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | journal = [[Multichannel News]] | title = 'Jonas' Sounds Solid Start For Disney Channel| first = Mike | last = Reynolds | edition = | page = | volume = | date = May 4, 2009 | accessdate=2010-10-20 | url = http://www.multichannel.com/article/231342-_Jonas_Sounds_Solid_Start_For_Disney_Channel.php }}&lt;/ref&gt; 73% of which was female. While this amounted to Disney Channel's best ratings in the time slot in eight months,&lt;ref name="lajtracker"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://music-mix.ew.com/2009/05/jonas-brothers.html?xid=rss-breakingnews-The%20Jonas%20Brothers%E2%8099%20new%20song:%20Like,%20OMG,%20you%20guys,%20it%20kind%20of%20rocks?! EW.com] {{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was also Disney Channel's second-lowest rated live-action series premiere in nearly four years.&lt;ref name="nysecond"&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = [[The New York Times]] | title = Boy Band Is Starting To Feel The Heat| first = Brooks | last = Barnes | department = The Arts/Cultural Desk; SECTC | page = 1 | date = May 25, 2009 | accessdate=2010-10-20 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/2009/05/25/arts/music/25jonas.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' comments that "Jonas didn't do poorly, exactly. [...] It's just that one expects the premiere of a show by a heavily promoted major Disney brand like the Jonas Brothers to make a bigger splash."&lt;ref name="nojpop"/&gt;

Viewership for the series second episode the following week fell sharply to nearly half its premiere audience—2.2&amp;nbsp;million total U.S. viewers and beyond cable's Top 100, which [[E!: Entertainment Television]] notes "in the grand scheme of things, is still a very good showing - unless you're trying to live up to the media's expectations for a world famous act." E! credits the decline to the premiere of Nickelodeon's hour-long ''[[iCarly]]'' special, "iDate a Bad Boy", which earned 6.5&amp;nbsp;million viewers.&lt;ref name="ejonasflop"&gt;[http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b123505_are_jonas_brothers_overhellipagain.html Are the Jonas Brothers Over…Again?] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090516022823/http://www.eonline.com/uberblog/b123505_are_jonas_brothers_overhellipagain.html |date=May 16, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ratings improved over the following episodes, and the ''New York Times'' reported, "If "Jonas" can dent ratings for ''iCarly'' […] the brothers’ sitcom will be considered a big success internally.&lt;ref name="nysecond" /&gt; However, just weeks after its premiere Disney Channel moved ''Jonas'' and ''Wizards of Waverly Place'' to Sunday and Friday evenings, respectively, and began airing movies in its old timeslot.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | newspaper = [[New York Daily News]] | title = Inner Tube| first = | last = | department = Television | page = 76 | date = May 28, 2009 | accessdate=2010-10-20 | url = http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/tv/2009/05/28/2009-05-28_untitled__inn28tv.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its Sunday timeslot, ''Jonas'' has been doing well in key kids demographics and averaging 3.4 million viewers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3iec91181b3bb41981421b109961a1dfca ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110055425/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/hr/content_display/television/news/e3iec91181b3bb41981421b109961a1dfca |date=January 10, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the move to Sundays and Fridays and declining ratings, along with the change in setting and ill-fated strategies in promoting the show would result in Disney's decision to pull the plug on "Jonas L.A." On November 8, 2010, it announced that the show will not return for a third season. In a statement from a Disney Channel spokesperson: "We've been fortunate to work with the enormously talented Jonas Brothers on several projects, including the Emmy-nominated series JONAS L.A.," adding that "We look forward to working with them on new projects in the future."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tvguide.com/News/Disney-Cancels-JONAS-1025220.aspx "Disney Channel Cancels JONAS L.A."] from [[TV Guide]] (November 8, 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Lake Placid''''' is an [[United States|American]] series of monster horror/comedy films created by [[David E. Kelley]]. It began with ''[[Lake Placid (film)|Lake Placid]]'' in 1999 and spawned five made for television sequels, ''[[Lake Placid 2]]'' (2007), ''[[Lake Placid 3]]'' (2010), ''[[Lake Placid: The Final Chapter]]'' (2012), ''[[Lake Placid vs. Anaconda]]'' (2015) (the latter being a crossover with the [[Anaconda (film series)|''Anaconda'' series]]) and ''[[Lake Placid: Legacy]]'' (2018). 

Each installment revolves around the presence of giant, 30-foot-long [[man-eater|man-eating]] [[crocodile]]s in the [[fictional location]] of Black Lake, [[Maine]], and the efforts of various groups to capture or destroy the creatures. All of the films reference members of the fictitious "Bickerman" family.

==Origin==
There are various theories about the origins of laksa. In Indonesia, the dish is believed to have been born from the Chinese coastal settlements and the mixing of cultures between Chinese merchants and the local cooking practices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2008/11/23/039dapur-naga039-a-peek-039peranakan039-cuisine.html|title='Dapur Naga': A peek into 'peranakan' cuisine |author=Prodita Sabarini quoting [[Myra Sidharta]]|date= October 24, 2012 |work=[[The Jakarta Post]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Historians believe laksa is a dish that was born from actual [[Interethnic marriage|intermarriage]].&lt;ref name="Banerji"&gt;{{cite news | title = How Intermarriage Created One of the World’s Most Delicious Foods | author = Urvija Banerji | date = 8 January 2016 | work = Atlas Obscura | url =http://www.atlasobscura.com/articles/how-intermarriage-created-one-of-the-worlds-most-delicious-foods}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early coastal ''pecinan'' (Chinese settlement) in maritime Southeast Asia, it was only Chinese men that ventured abroad out from China to trade. When settling down in the new town, these Chinese traders and sailors set out to find local wives, and these women began incorporating local spices and coconut milk into Chinese noodle soup served to their husbands. This creates the hybrid Chinese-local (Malay or Javanese) culture called [[Peranakan]] culture.&lt;ref name="Banerji"/&gt; As Peranakan Chinese communities have blended their ancestors' culture with local culture, Peranakan communities in different places now demonstrate diversity according to the local flavour.&lt;ref name="JP-Tangerang"&gt;{{cite news | title = Weekly 5: Delicacies of Tangerang 'peranakan'|work=[[The Jakarta Post]] | date = 13 February 2015 | author = Corry Elyda | url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2015/02/13/weekly-5-delicacies-tangerang-peranakan.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In Malaysia, the dish is believed to have been introduced by Chinese immigrants in [[Malacca]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://asiancorrespondent.com/2012/10/laksa-discovering-malaysias-signature-dish/|title=Laksa: Discovering Malaysia’s signature dish|author=Lara Dunston|date= October 24, 2012 |work=Asian Correspondent}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Singapore, the dish (or its local "Katong" version) is believed to have been created after interaction between the Peranakans with the local Singaporeans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://eresources.nlb.gov.sg/infopedia/articles/SIP_884_2004-12-27.html |title=Laksa Origins|publisher=[[National Library Board]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Banerji"/&gt;

Because laksa has different varieties across the region, it is difficult to pinpoint the exact origin of the dish. Nevertheless, numbers of laksa recipes has been developed along the trade channels of Southeast Asia—where the ports of [[Penang]], [[Medan]], [[Malacca]], [[Singapore]], [[Palembang]], and [[Jakarta|Batavia]] (now Jakarta) are the major stops along the historic [[spice trade|spice route]]. The intensive trade links among these port cities enables exchanges of ideas to took place, including sharing recipes.&lt;ref name="Banerji"/&gt;

==Popularity==
Various recipes of laksas have gained popularity in Malaysia, Singapore, and Indonesia; and subsequently international recognition. Initially in July 2011, CNN Travel ranked Penang Asam Laksa 7th out of the 50 most delicious foods in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://travel.cnn.com/explorations/eat/worlds-50-most-delicious-foods-067535 |title=World's 50 best foods|date= July 21, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its rank however, fell to number 26th after CNN held an online poll by 35,000 people, published in September 2011.&lt;ref name="CNNGo"&gt;{{cite news | title = Your pick: World's 50 best foods | author = Tim Cheung | date = 7 September 2011 | publisher = CNNGo | url = http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/eat/readers-choice-worlds-50-most-delicious-foods-012321 | accessdate = 12 June 2015 | archive-url = https://web.archive.org/web/20121111184944/http://www.cnngo.com/explorations/eat/readers-choice-worlds-50-most-delicious-foods-012321 | archive-date = 11 November 2012 | dead-url = yes | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Singaporean Curry Laksa on the other hand ranked in number 44th.&lt;ref name="CNNGo"/&gt;

In Indonesia, laksa is one of the traditional comfort foods; the spicy warm noodle soup is much appreciated during cold rainy days. However, its popularity is somewhat overshadowed by ''[[Soto (food)|soto]]'', a similar hearty warm soup dish, which is often consumed with rice instead of noodles. In modern households, it is common practice to mix and match the recipes of laksas; if traditional laksa noodle is not available, Japanese [[udon]] noodles might be used instead.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = Weekend Bites: Melting pot laksa to keep warm on rainy days | author = Theodora Hurustiati | newspaper = The Jakarta Post | date = 27 October 2012 | url = http://www.thejakartapost.com/news/2012/10/27/weekend-bites-melting-pot-laksa-keep-warm-rainy-days.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types==
The type of laksa is based upon the soup base employed in its recipe; either rich and savoury [[coconut milk]], fresh and sour ''asam'' ([[tamarind]], ''[[Garcinia atroviridis|gelugur]]'' or ''[[kokum]]''), or the combination of the two. There are three basic types of laksa: ''curry laksa'', ''asam laksa'', and other variant that can be identified as either curry or asam laksa. Curry laksa is a [[coconut milk]] curry soup with noodles, while asam laksa is a sour, most often [[tamarind]]-based, soup with noodles. Thick rice noodles also known as '''laksa noodles''' are most commonly used, although thin [[rice vermicelli]] (''bee hoon'' or ''mee hoon'') are also common, and some recipes might create their own rice noodle from scratch. Some variants might use other types of noodles; Johor laksa for example uses [[spaghetti]],&lt;ref name="JP1"/&gt; while a fusion recipe might use Japanese [[udon]] noodle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Spicy Malaysian Tofu Laksa with Udon Noodles|publisher=haute chef|url=http://hautechef.in/index.php/spicy-malaysian-tofu-laksa-with-udon-noodles.html||}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SBS-Laksa"/&gt;

===Curry laksa===
[[File:Laksa.JPG|thumb|Curry laksa sold in [[Bukit Batok]], Singapore]]

'''Curry laksa''' (in many places referred to simply as "laksa") is a [[coconut milk|coconut]]-based curry soup.&lt;ref name="SBS-Laksa"/&gt; The main ingredients for most versions of curry laksa include bean curd puffs, [[surimi|fish sticks]], [[shrimp]], and [[Cockle (bivalve)|cockle]]s. Some vendors may sell [[Chicken (food)|chicken]] laksa. Laksa is commonly served with a spoonful of ''[[sambal]]'' chilli paste and garnished with [[Vietnamese coriander]], or ''laksa leaf'', which is known in [[Malay language|Malay]] as ''daun kesum''.

This is usually known as [[curry mee]] in [[Penang]] rather than curry laksa, due to the different kind of noodles used (yellow ''[[mee pok|mee]]'' or ''bee hoon'', as opposed to the thick white laksa noodles). Curry mee in [[Penang]] uses congealed pork blood, a delicacy to the [[Malaysian Chinese]] community.

The term "curry laksa" is more commonly used in [[Kuala Lumpur]] and [[Singapore]]. Laksa is quite popular in Singapore, and curry laksa or ''nyonya'' laksa can be simply served as plain laksa, with just noodles and gravy, or with additional ingredients. Singaporean curry laksa ranked in number 44th of CNN World's 50 best foods.&lt;ref name="CNNGo"/&gt; Recently, several modern twist of curry laksa has been developed, such as laksa ''[[yong tau foo]]'' which is stuffed tofu laksa, and a premium upgrade of [[lobster]] laksa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=22 lobster dishes in Singapore, Lobster Laksa|publisher=Hungry Go Where? Singapore|url=http://www.hungrygowhere.com/gallery/22-lobster-dishes-in-singapore-*gid-886d3101/d22b0200|accessdate=13 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Indonesian cuisine|Indonesia]], most of laksa variants are coconut milk-based soup, thus can be categorized into curry laksa. Common spices include [[turmeric]], [[coriander]], [[candlenut]], [[lemongrass]], [[garlic]], [[shallot]], and [[Black pepper|pepper]] cooked in [[coconut milk]]. Widely available ''daun kemangi'' (Indonesian lemon basil leaf) is commonly used instead of ''daun kesum''. ''Bihun'' or thin [[rice vermicelli]] is most commonly used noodle instead of thick rice noodle, and some recipe might add slices of ''[[ketupat]]'' or ''[[lontong]]'' rice cake. Bogor laksa uses ground ''[[oncom]]'' into its soup.

Variants of curry Laksa include:

* '''Laksa lemak''', also known as '''nyonya laksa''' (Malay: '''''Laksa nyonya'''''), is a type of laksa with a rich coconut gravy. ''Lemak'' is a culinary description in the Malay language which specifically refers to the presence of [[coconut milk]] which adds a distinctive richness to a dish. As the name implies, it is made with a rich, slightly sweet and strongly spiced coconut gravy. Laksa lemak is usually made with a fish-based gravy (with vegetarian food stalls omitting fish) and quite similar to '''Thai laksa''' (Malay: '''''Laksa Thai'''''), perhaps to the point that one could say they are one and the same.
[[File:YosriLaksam.jpg|thumb|right|Laksam is a popular dish in Kelantan and Terengganu]]
* '''Laksam''', also known in [[Thailand]] as '''Lasae''' ({{lang-th|ละแซ}}),&lt;ref name="Thairath" /&gt; a speciality of the Northeastern Malaysian states of [[Kelantan]], [[Terengganu]], and [[Kedah]], is made with very thick flat white rice flour noodles in a rich, full-bodied white gravy of boiled fish and coconut milk. Though usually made of fish flesh, it is sometimes made with eels. Traditionally Laksa is eaten with hands rather than with eating utensils due to the gravy's thick consistency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tourism.terengganu.gov.my/culinary/laksam.htm Terengganu government tourism – Laksam.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100417141629/http://www.tourism.terengganu.gov.my/culinary/laksam.htm |date=2010-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* '''Palembang Lakso''' (Indonesian: '''''Lakso Palembang'''''): The [[Palembang]] style laksa. Unlike laksan that uses slices of ''pempek'' fishcake, lakso uses noodle-like steamed [[sago]] paste served in coconut milk soup with mixture spices: of palm sugar, black pepper, turmeric, coriander, and candlenut, sprinkled with fried shallots.

Thai laksa uses rice noodles, garlic, lemongrass, ginger, red curry paste, chicken stock, soy sauce, sugar, coconut milk, prawns, button mushrooms, spinach, lime juice, coriander, and onions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Thai Laksa |publisher=All Recipes|url=http://allrecipes.com.au/recipe/5334/thai-laksa.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Asam laksa===
[[File:Penang laksa.jpg|thumb|right|A bowl of Penang laksa, a variant of Asam laksa.]]

'''Asam laksa''' is a sour, fish and [[tamarind]]-based soup. Penang Asam Laksa listed at number 26th on ''World's 50 most delicious foods'' compiled by ''CNN Go'' in 2011.&lt;ref name="CNNGo"/&gt; ''Asam'' is the Malay word for any ingredients that makes a dish tastes sour (e.g. [[tamarind]], ''[[Garcinia atroviridis|gelugur]]'' or [[kokum]]). Laksa typically uses [[Garcinia atroviridis|''asam keping'']], known as [[kokum]] in the English speaking world, which is a type of dried slices of sour [[mangosteen]]s. The modern Malay spelling is ''asam'', though the spelling ''assam'' is still frequently used.

The main ingredients for asam laksa include shredded fish, normally ''kembung'' (small mackerel of the [[Rastrelliger]] genus), and finely sliced vegetables including cucumber, onions, red chillies, pineapple, lettuce, common mint, ''daun kesum'' (Vietnamese mint or laksa mint), and pink ''bunga kantan'' ([[Etlingera eliator|torch ginger]]). Asam laksa is normally served with either thick rice noodles or thin rice noodles ([[vermicelli]]). And topped off with ''[[petis|petis udang]]'' or "hae ko" (蝦膏), a thick sweet prawn/[[shrimp paste]].&lt;ref name="SBS-Laksa"/&gt;

Variants of asam laksa include:

* '''Penang laksa''' (Malay: '''''Laksa Pulau Pinang'''''), also known as ''asam laksa'' from the [[Malay language|Malay]] for [[tamarind]], comes from the Malaysian island of [[Penang]]. It is made with [[mackerel]] (''ikan kembung'') soup and its main distinguishing feature is the ''asam'' or tamarind which gives the soup a sour taste. The fish is poached and then flaked. Other ingredients that give Penang laksa its distinctive flavour include [[lemongrass]], [[galangal]] (''lengkuas'') and chilli. Typical garnishes include [[Mentha|mint]], [[pineapple]] slices, thinly sliced [[onion]], hε-ko, a thick sweet prawn paste and use of [[Etlingera eliator|torch ginger]] flower. This, and not 'curry mee' is the usual 'laksa' one gets in Penang. Penang Laksa is listed at number 7 on the ''[http://travel.cnn.com/explorations/eat/worlds-50-most-delicious-foods-067535 World's 50 best foods]''compiled by CNN Go in July 2011
* '''Perlis laksa''' (Malay: '''''Laksa Perlis''''') is similar to Penang Laksa but differs in garnishing used such as catfish and eel fish. The famous Perlis laksa can be found in Kuala Perlis.
* '''Kedah laksa''' (Malay: '''''Laksa Kedah''''') is very similar to Penang laksa and only differs in the garnishing used. Sliced boiled eggs are usually added to the dish. Kedah laksa used rice to make a laksa noodle. The famous laksa in Kedah is Laksa Telok Kechai.
* '''Ipoh laksa''' (Malay: '''''Laksa Ipoh'''''), from the Malaysian city of [[Ipoh]], is similar to Penang laksa but has a more sour (rather than sweet) taste, and contains prawn paste.
* '''Kuala Kangsar Laksa''' (Malay: '''''Laksa Kuala Kangsar'''''), made of wheat flour (usually hand made). The soup is rather lighter than the common laksa taste and so much different from Ipoh Laksa in shape, taste, and smell. The local municipal council even built a complex called "Kompleks Cendol dan Laksa" near the river bank of the Perak River. It is the main attraction for tourists in Kuala Kangsar.{{citation needed|date=January 2012}}
* '''Medan laksa''' (Indonesian: '''''Laksa Medan'''''), from Indonesian city of [[Medan]], [[North Sumatra]]. Quite similar to asam laksa from Penang right across the [[Strait of Malacca|strait]], which also uses flaked ''ikan kembung'' (mackerel), ''[[Etlingera elatior|kecombrang]]'' (wild ginger flower), lemongrass, and chili pepper. It is quite differ however, by using ''[[Garcinia atroviridis|asam gelugur]]'' instead of ''asam jawa'' (tamarind), turmeric, adding ''[[terasi]]'' (shrimp paste), shallot, garlic, and [[key lime]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Laksa Medan |publisher=Femina|url=http://www.femina.co.id/kuliner/resep/hidangan.indonesia/laksa.medan/004/001/384/02 |language=Indonesian |accessdate=8 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Laksa Sarawak.JPG|thumb|right|Laksa Sarawak]]
* '''Sarawak laksa''' (Malay: '''''Laksa Sarawak''''') comes from the Malaysian state of [[Sarawak]], on the island of [[Borneo]].

Johor laksa has coconut milk, use ''[[kerisik]]'', ''[[asam Gelugur]]'', dried prawns, lemon grass, [[galangal]], and spices akin to curry. The garnishing comprises slices of onion, [[mung bean|beansprouts]] (''[[taugeh]]''), daun selasih, Vietnamese coriander or ''daun kesum'', cucumber, and pickled white radish.

* '''Terengganu laksa''' (Malay: '''''Laksa Terengganu''''') is the easiest laksa recipe that is famous among peoples from the town of [[Kuala Terengganu]] of the [[Terengganu]] state, located at the east coast of [[Peninsular Malaysia]]. The main ingredient of Terengganu Laksa's sauce is ''ikan kembong'' or [[round scad]] mackerel that are boiled and minced. The minced fish are fried with onions, garlic, ginger, [[datil pepper]], [[belacan]], ''kantan'' flower, Vietnamese coriander or ''daun kesum'', [[lemon grass]], and dried [[tamarind]] slice. Coconut milk will then be added as the final ingredient and stirred until it is all mixed up and becomes thick. Terengganu Laksa is served just like the Italian [[spaghetti]] by adding ''ulam'' (raw vegetables) and blended chili on the side. Another variable of Terengganu Laksa is ''Laksam''. The sauce's recipe are exactly the same but the noodles are a bit bigger and flat.
* '''Tambelan laksa''' (Indonesian: '''''Laksa Tambelan''''') from [[Tambelan Archipelago]] in [[Riau Islands]] province of Indonesia, off the west coast of [[West Kalimantan]]. It uses flaked sauteed ''ikan tongkol asap'' ([[smoked]] [[mackerel tuna]] or [[skipjack tuna]]) and lump of sagoo noodles, served in spicy coconut-based stock made of ''[[kerisik]]'' (sauteed grated coconut, pounded or blended into paste).

Laksa is simply referred to or ordered at a restaurant as laksa (curry laksa) or asam laksa. By default, laksa means the standard curry laksa while asam laksa refers to the standard Penang version. If a restaurant serves a non-standard version, the restaurant will qualify the laksa by the version being sold. For example, a restaurant serving Katong laksa will list Katong laksa on the menu.

Las Posadas is celebrated by Latinos and Spaniards and people who appreciate the culture and holiday of the  Mexican and Spanish.

==Etymology==
''Las Posadas'' is [[Spanish language|Spanish]] for ''[[lodging]]'', or ''[[:wikt:accommodation|accommodation]]'', which in this case refers to the inn in the story of the [[nativity of Jesus]]. It uses the plural form as the celebration lasts for a nine-day interval (called the ''[[novena]]'') during the Christmas season. The novena represents the nine-month pregnancy&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt;&lt;ref name="elpc" /&gt; of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], the mother of Jesus celebrated by Christians.

==History==
The celebration has been a tradition in Mexico for 400 years. Many Mexican holidays include dramatizations of original events, a tradition which has its roots in the ritual of Bible plays used to teach religious doctrine to a largely illiterate population in Europe as early as the 10th and 11th centuries. These plays lost favor with the Church as they became popularized with the addition of folk music and other non-religious elements, and were eventually banned; only to be re-introduced in the sixteenth century by two Spanish saints as the Christmas Pageant, a new kind of religious ceremony to accompany the Christmas holiday.

In Mexico, the [[winter solstice]] festival was one of the most important celebrations of the year and it was on December 12 according to the [[Gregorian_calendar#Preparation|Julian calendar]] used by the Spaniards until 1582.&lt;ref name="Mansueto"&gt; Mansueto, Anthony E.,

p. 747, ABC-CLIO, 2016&lt;/ref&gt; while their most important deity, the sun god ''Huitzilopochtli,'' was born during the month of December (''panquetzaliztli)''. The parallel in time between this native celebration and the birth of [[Christ]] lent itself to an almost seamless merging of the two holidays. Seeing the opportunity to proselytize, Spanish missionaries brought the custom of the re-invented religious pageant to Mexico, where they used it to teach the story of Jesus' birth to Mexico's people. In 1586, Friar Diego de Soria obtained a papal bull from Pope Sixtus V, stating that a Christmas Mass (''misa de Aguinaldo''), be observed as novenas on the nine days preceding Christmas Day throughout Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://mymissiontastesofsf.wordpress.com/2014/12/16/las-posadas-contraband-fruit-and-warm-mexican-christmas-punch-wrecipe/|title=MEXICAN FOODWAYS: Las Posadas, contraband fruit and warm CHRISTMAS PUNCH|author=|date=16 December 2014|website=wordpress.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While its roots are in [[Catholicism]], even [[Protestant]] Latinos follow the tradition.&lt;ref name="wsj" /&gt; It may have been started in the 15th century by Friar [[Pedro de Gante]].&lt;ref name="elpc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.statesmanjournal.com/article/20101222/COMMUNITIES/12220312/1108/NEWS|title='Las Posadas' event celebrates the Christmas story|last=Guerrero-Huston|first=Thelma|date=2010-12-22|work=[[Statesman Journal]]|accessdate=24 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may have been started by early friars who combined Spanish Catholicism with the December [[Aztec]] celebration of the birth of [[Huitzilopochtli]].&lt;ref name="elpc" /&gt; The Las Posadas text and ritual are also strongly identified throughout the Rio Grande with converso settlers. For more information see Song From a Withered Limb in the journal HaLapid, Autumn/Winter 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heller|first=Reid|date=Autumn–Winter 2015|title=Song From a Withered Limb|url=|journal=HaLapid |volume= XXXIII/XXXIV|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; also found here: https://cryptojewisheducation.com/2016/09/05/song-from-a-withered-limb-las-posadas-and-the-converso-crisis-of-the-16th-century/

==Re-enactment==
Two people dress up as Mary and Joseph.  Certain houses are designated to be an "[[inn]]" (thus the name "Posada").  The head of the procession will have a candle inside a paper lampshade. At each house, the resident responds by singing a song and Mary and Joseph are finally recognized and allowed to enter. Once the "innkeepers" let them in, the group of guests come into the home and kneel around the Nativity scene to pray (typically, the [[Rosary]]). Latin American countries have continued to celebrate this holiday to this day, with very few changes to the tradition. In some places, the final location may be a church instead of a home. The people asking for posada travel to 1 house each night for 8 nights.

Individuals may actually play the various parts of Mary (María) and Joseph with the expectant mother riding a real donkey ([[burro]]), with attendants such as angels and shepherds acquired along the way, or the pilgrims may carry images of the holy personages instead. Children may carry [[poinsettias]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://newsok.com/st.-marys-students-observe-las-posadas-tradition/article/3523642|title=St. Mary's students observe Las Posadas tradition|last=Pemberton|first=Tricia|date=2010-12-15|work=[[The Oklahoman]]|accessdate=24 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The procession will be followed by musicians, with the entire procession singing posadas such as [[pedir posada]].&lt;ref name="elpc"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aldama|first1=Arturo J.|last2=Candelaria|first2=Cordelia|authorlink2=Cordelia Candelaria|last3=García |first3=Peter |title=Encyclopedia of Latino popular culture|year=2004|publisher=Greenwood Press|location=Westport, Conn|isbn=0-313-33211-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;
At the end of each night's journey, there will be Christmas carols (''[[villancico]]s''), children will break open star-shaped [[piñatas]] to obtain candy and fruit hidden inside, and there will be a feast.&lt;ref name="elpc" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dodgeglobe.com/news/x1882972061/Las-Posadas-Passing-on-a-Hispanic-tradition-in-Dodge-City|title=Las Posadas: Passing on a Hispanic tradition in Dodge City|last=Candia|first=Pablo|date=2010-12-20|work=[[Dodge City Daily Globe]]|accessdate=24 December 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710143949/http://www.dodgeglobe.com/news/x1882972061/Las-Posadas-Passing-on-a-Hispanic-tradition-in-Dodge-City|archivedate=10 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Piñatas are traditionally made out of clay. It is expected to meet all the invitees in a previous procession.

==Regional variations==
In [[Wisconsin]], the procession may occur within a home, rather than outside, because of the weather.&lt;ref name="wsj"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://host.madison.com/wsj/news/local/article_8e8434aa-0e19-11e0-a52d-001cc4c002e0.html|title=Latinos here celebrate Christmas tradition Las Posadas, ‘festival of acceptance’|last=Erickson|first=Doug|date=2010-12-23|work=[[Wisconsin State Journal]]|accessdate=24 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One event in [[Portland, Oregon]] finishes with [[Santa Claus]] and Christmas gifts donated for needy children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.catholicsentinel.org/main.asp?SectionID=2&amp;SubSectionID=35&amp;ArticleID=13755|title=Event mixes Christmas tradition and charity|last=Langlois|first=Ed|date=2010-12-23|work=[[Catholic Sentinel]]|location=Portland, Oregon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[New York (state)|New York]], worshippers may drink [[Atole]], a corn-sugar drink traditional during Christmas.&lt;ref name="ens"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.episcopalchurch.org/79425_126248_ENG_HTM.htm|title=Las Posadas observances adapt, recall Latin American celebration of the nativity|last=McCaughan|first=Pat|date=2010-12-17|work=Episcopal News Service|accessdate=24 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A large procession occurs along the [[San Antonio River Walk]] and has been held since 1966.&lt;ref name="Fisher1996"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fisher|first=Lewis F.|title=Saving San Antonio: the precarious preservation of a heritage|year=1996|publisher=Texas Tech University Press|location=Lubbock, Tex|isbn=0-89672-372-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="HoytSimons1996"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hoyt|first1=Catherine A.|last2=Simons|first2=Helen|title=A guide to hispanic Texas|year=1996|publisher=University of Texas Press|location=Austin|isbn=0-292-77709-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is held across large landmarks in [[San Antonio, Texas]], including the [[Arneson River Theater]], [[Museo Alameda]], and the [[Spanish Governor's Palace]], ending at the [[Cathedral of San Fernando]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.victoriaadvocate.com/news/2010/dec/20/03_daytrip_san_antonio_riverwalk_107643/?entertainment&amp;local-entertainment|title=San Antonio's River Walk offers winter wonderland|last=Eakin|first=Tyra|date=2010-12-20|work=[[Victoria Advocate]]|accessdate=24 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar celebrations==
In the [[Philippines]], where strong [[Spanish culture|cultural influences]] persist from [[Spanish East Indies|Spanish colonial times]], the Posadas tradition is illustrated by the [[Christmas in the Philippines#Panunulúyan|Panunulúyan]] pageant. Sometimes it is performed immediately before the [[Misa de Gallo]] (Midnight Mass), sometimes on each of the nine nights. The main difference from Mexico is that actors are used for Mary and Joseph instead of statues, and sing the requests for accommodation. The lines of the "innkeepers" are also often sung, but sometimes these respond without singing. Another difference is that the lyrics are not in Spanish but in a [[Languages of the Philippines|local language]], such as [[Tagalog language|Tagalog]].

In [[Nicaragua]] the older generations grew up celebrating posadas but somehow they became extinct in big cities by the 60's. However, there is a major holiday in [[Nicaragua]] called [[:es:La gritería|La Gritería]] (The Shoutings), on 7 December in honor of La Purísima Virgen (The Purest Virgin). The Purisima originated in Leon in the 1600s with Franciscan monks but the celebration spread quickly throughout the country.  By the 1800s it became a national holiday and today it has become a tradition wherever Nicaraguans have emigrated to such places such as Costa Rica, Honduras, Miami, Houston, Los Angeles and San Francisco. The Purisima starts at noon on December 7 with major fireworks throughout the country. Then at about 6:00pm more fireworks announce the time when adults and children go out around their neighborhoods or towns with burlap sacks in hand visiting different, beautifully crafted altars while caroling the Virgin Mary. In exchange for singing people receive sweets, refreshments, fruit and toys. The celebration goes on well into the night.  Finally at midnight the most outstanding fireworks in the shape of Mary, stars and angels begin, lasting for half an hour.

[[Cuba]] also has something similar, called [[Parrandas]] (though Parrandas has more of a [[Carnival|Carnaval]] in atmosphere). The tradition began in the 19th century when Father Francisco Vigil de Quiñones, the priest of the Grand Cathedral of Remedios, in order to get the people to come to midnight masses the week before Christmas had the idea to put together groups of children and provide them with jars, plates and spoons so they could run around the village making noise and singing verses. The idea persisted over the years and with time it gained complexity ending in the street party that has remained till these days.

In [[Colombia]], [[Venezuela]] and [[Ecuador]], families and friends get together from 16 to 24 December to pray the [[novena of aguinaldos]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4545">'''Learning level descriptors''' are statements that provide a broad indication of learning appropriate to attainment at a particular level, describing the characteristics and context of learning expected at that level. They are designed to support the reviewing of specified learning outcomes and assessment criteria in order to develop particular modules and units and to assign credits at the appropriate level.&lt;ref&gt;Vlasceanu, L., Grünberg, L. and Pârlea, D. 2007. Quality assurance and accreditation: a glossary of basic terms and de nitions. Bucharest, UNESCO Centre Européen pour l’Enseignement Supérieur (CEPES). &lt;nowiki&gt;http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0013/001346/134621e.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002428/242887e.pdf|title=Level-setting and recognition of learning outcomes: The use of level descriptors in the twenty-first century|last=Keevy|first=James|last2=Chakroun|first2=Borhene|publisher=Paris, UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-92-3-100138-3|location=|pages=10–16, 33, 49–51, 60}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this context, ''level'' refers to the level at which the outcomes of learning are allocated through the use of descriptors which constitute an integral component of qualifications frameworks internationally. Learning level descriptors are an integral part of [[qualifications framework]]s regionally, nationally, and globally, but also consider how the level of learning is determined in other contexts, such as [[longitudinal studies]], international competence assessments and diagnostic reviews.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Learning level descriptors vary across qualifications frameworks, and understanding the similarities and differences is the first step in establishing [[world reference levels]] for learning.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Formulation ==
Descriptors are formulated using learning outcomes language, yet they are divided into different domains based on specific contextual decisions. These domains are mostly referred to as sets of like competences which describe progression across the levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Setting levels through level descriptors ==
All types of qualifications frameworks use level descriptors based on learning outcomes, to define a set of hierarchical levels across a series of domains. The hierarchy of level descriptors is purposefully developed to allow for alignment of qualifications:

"Each of these unique learning outcome terms is defined in statements of knowledge, skill and competence. They are assembled in vertical strands for each framework level. The use of strands of learning outcomes and levels in a qualifications framework helps improve the hierarchical and distinguishing characteristics applicable between levels as well as within a level. It provides those designing qualifications with a finely drawn vertical and horizontal structure (grid) to facilitate easy alignment."&lt;ref&gt;NQAUAE. 2012. ''Qualifications Framework Emirates Handbook''. Abu Dhabi, NQAUAE.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Qualifications are compared against the level descriptors and pegged at a particular level of a qualifications framework. To be more specific, the learning outcomes contained within a qualification are compared with the learning outcomes listed in the level descriptors.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  P. 49-51

== Criticism ==
The pragmatic approach that underlies the current understandings of level descriptors has resulted in a weak theoretical model that will take many years to be improved. While level descriptors may be important to standards developers, stakeholders are interested in levels, not level descriptors. Level descriptors are sometimes criticized for being too broad and generic to be applicable to a specific qualification from a specific sector. The defense has been that level descriptors are not an exact science, but only provide guidance with regard to levels.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

It started in 1970s. Their plan was to artificially create the most powerful soldier possible.

The character returns in the prequel ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]'' as a child mercenary nicknamed the {{nihongo|'''White Mamba'''|ホワイトマンバ|Howaito Manba}} with his real name revealed to be {{nihongo|'''Eli'''|イーライ|Īrai}}.

Raised in the United Kingdom following his birth, Liquid served as an operative for the British SAS and later became the field commander of FOXHOUND before the events of the game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[Metal Gear Solid]]|developer=[[Kojima Productions|KCE Japan]]|year=1999|quote='''Roy Campbell:''' But he never once showed his face in Century House. He was taken prisoner in Iraq, and after that there was no trace of him for several years. After you retired, he was rescued and became a member of FOX-HOUND}}&lt;/ref&gt; He leads the hostile takeover of Shadow Moses Island in order to acquire Big Boss's remains and use his genetic information to treat the mutations affecting his subordinates, the Genome Army. Liquid harbors a strong resentment towards his twin brother Solid Snake, as he mistakenly believes that Snake received all of Big Boss's superior genes, while he was given only the flawed genes. In reality, it is Liquid who carries the superior genes.&lt;ref name=MGSpostcred&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[Metal Gear Solid]]|developer=KCE Japan|quote='''Revolver Ocelot''': Yes. The inferior one was the winner after all. ...That's right. Until the very end, Liquid thought he was the inferior one.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Snake meets Liquid for the first time after he is taken captive by the enemy and imprisoned in a medical room. The two brothers battle each other multiple times throughout the story. First, Liquid tries to kill Snake by piloting a Hind D and pursuing him across the Communication Towers, but Snake destroys the helicopter with anti-air Stinger missiles. Afterward, Liquid manipulates Snake into activating [[Metal Gear (weapon)#Metal Gear REX|Metal Gear REX]] by disguising himself as Snake's mentor [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Master Miller|Master Miller]]. Snake destroys REX, but falls unconscious in the aftermath, allowing Liquid to take his unconscious brother to the top of the ruined REX and challenge him to a fistfight. Snake prevails, but Liquid survives again and pursues Snake in a jeep chase that results in a crash outside the island's facility. Just as he approaches a trapped Snake, Liquid suddenly succumbs to the FOXDIE virus that had been injected into his twin brother. Liquid's death leaves Snake in doubt of his own survival, as FOXDIE targets its victims based on specific DNA.

===''Metal Gear Solid 2''===
{{further|Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty}}
After his death, Liquid Snake's right arm was transplanted to [[Revolver Ocelot]], replacing the one he lost his during the events of the previous game.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty|developer=KCE Japan|quote='''Solidus Snake''': "It's happening again?"/ '''Revolver Ocelot''': "This damn right arm -- Liquid! It's almost as if it's having its revenge." / '''Solidus''': "How much do you think we spent on that arm in Lyon?

Maybe that man's presence...."|level=Plant chapter, Shell 1 Core B1 conference room}}&lt;/ref&gt; This results in Liquid's personality manifesting itself within Ocelot whenever Solid Snake is in proximity, causing Ocelot to adopt Liquid's voice and mannerisms. This happens for the first time when Snake confronts Ocelot during the hijacking of [[Metal Gear (weapon)#Metal Gear RAY|Metal Gear RAY]] from the disguised [[oil tanker|tanker]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty|developer=KCE Japan|quote='''Liquid Snake''': The price of physical prodigy...

It was intended during the finalization of ''Metal Gear Solid 2'' for Liquid to send Arsenal Gear crashing into [[Manhattan]] in the game's climax.&lt;ref name="MGS2cutdialogue"&gt;{{cite video game|title=[[The Document of Metal Gear Solid 2]]|developer=KCE Japan|quote='''Liquid Snake:''' "Time to say goodbye." / ''Liquid Snake flips a switch inside RAY.'' / '''Solid Snake:''' "What are you doing?" / '''Liquid Snake:''' "I’ve started Arsenal's navigation program.

That has a nice ring to it."}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the line of dialogue that was intended to explicitly state this was cut from the final release, due to the [[September 11 attacks]] occurring as the game was nearing finalization. The dialogue, however, was retained in the novelization. The ''Metal Gear Solid: Sons of Liberty'' graphic novel features an additional scene in which Liquid haunts Ocelot's subconscious by summoning the spirit of [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#The Sorrow|The Sorrow]], Ocelot's father, who expresses disappointment at Ocelot due to his inability to dispel Liquid's spirit from his body.

===''Metal Gear Solid 4''===
{{further|Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots}}
In the years after the Big Shell incident, Liquid Snake's consciousness seemingly takes Revolver Ocelot's body completely, becoming a new personality known as Liquid Ocelot. He takes control of the mercenary company Outer Heaven, which serves as the mother company to five of the largest private military companies in the world, and leads an insurrection against The Patriots' A.I. control system. However, the Liquid persona is ultimately revealed to be an elaborate facade by Ocelot himself that was possible through a process of self-hypnosis, with Ocelot having already replaced Liquid's arm with a cybernetic prosthetic sometime before the events of the game in order to restore his psyche.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video game|title=Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of The Patriots|developer=Kojima Productions|quote='''Big Boss:''' And Ocelot... In order to fool the System... Used nanomachines and psychotherapy to transplant Liquid's personality onto his own. He used hypnotic suggestion to turn himself into Liquid's mental doppelganger.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The rest of Liquid's remains was used to restore Big Boss's wounded body with spare body parts.

===''Metal Gear Solid V''===
====''The Phantom Pain''====
{{further|Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain}}
Liquid Snake's next appearance in the series was in ''[[Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain]]'', a prequel set in 1984, 21 years before the events of the original ''Metal Gear Solid''. In this game, the young Liquid is revealed to be a 12 year old child soldier named Eli, who fled from his home in [[England]] after learning about his nature as a clone. He becomes an active mercenary in the Angola-Zaire border region in Central Africa, where he sets up his own mercenary unit consisting entirely of children, earning him the nickname "Nyoka ya Mpembe" or "White Mamba" due to being the only white child soldier in the region.

The player first encounters Eli in Masa Village after it is taken over by Eli's group in Episode 23. After the player subdues Eli, he is taken into Mother Base where the [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Diamond Dogs|Diamond Dogs]] staff try to re-educate him and integrate him into normal society along with the other child soldiers. However, Eli resists this treatment and rebels against the Mother Base staff, focusing his hostility on their leader [[Venom Snake]], whom he mistakenly believes to be his biological father (unaware of his true nature as Big Boss's body double, as revealed in Episode 46).

When Eli sneaks into a chopper during Snake's deployment to OKB Zero in Kabul during the events of Episode 31, he catches the attention of the young psychic known as the  [[Psycho Mantis|Third Child]], who uses Eli's will to activate [[Metal Gear (weapon)#Sahelanthropus|Sahelanthropus]] and attack Snake. After Sahelanthropus is neutralized and transferred to Mother Base, the Third Child infiltrates the place and befriends Eli, giving him a vial containing the English strain of [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Skull Face|Skull Face's]] vocal cord parasite. The two plot out an elaborate escape plan which involves helping other child soldiers escape and fixing Sahelanthropus with the assistance of its creator [[List of characters in the Metal Gear series#Huey|Dr. Emmerich]]. Ultimately, Eli succeeds in reactivating Sahelanthropus and hijacks it from Mother Base, escaping alongside the Third Child and the other child mercenaries. This is Eli's last appearance in the game.

====Kingdom of the Flies====
"Kingdom of the Flies", also known as Episode 51, is a mission that was omitted from the released version of ''Metal Gear Solid V'' that would have depicted Eli's actions following his escape from Mother Base. Video of this mission is featured in a Blu-ray disc included with the limited edition release of the game, depicting its events though concept art and partially completed cutscenes.&lt;ref name=mgsv_collectors&gt;{{cite AV media|date=September 1, 2015|title=Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain - Collector's Disc|chapter=Phantom Episode: Kingdom of the Flies|medium=Blu-ray Disc|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fhcsdJ899ps |access-date=August 15, 2015 |format= Youtube |publisher=Konami Digital Entertainment|asin=B00UFOYR2I}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mission has Snake pursuing Eli's group in an unnamed island in Africa surrounded by salt water, where the English strain of the vocal cord parasite has been spread in order to prevent access to adults. Snake confronts Eli and a battle ensues between the reactivated Sahelanthropus and an entire battalion of Diamond Dogs soldiers. Eli is defeated, but Snake is forced to abandon him when he displays signs of infections, as Eli's immunity to the parasites is no longer in effect due to [[puberty]]. Before Eli can die, the Third Child arrives and uses his psychic powers to remove the parasite within him. The two young friends escape just as Diamond Dogs launches a Napalm air strike to cleanse the island of the parasites. The story ends on an image of the [[Manhattan]] skyline, with Eli vowing revenge.

==Concept and design==

===Physical appearance===
Liquid Snake is described as being almost identical to Solid Snake in terms of facial appearance and physique, with the only difference between them being Liquid's darker skin tone and medium-length blond hair. He has a tattoo of a snake entwined around a sword on his left arm, with concept art also showing a small piercing on his left ear and [[dog tag]]s around his neck.&lt;ref name=art_of_mgs1&gt;{{cite book|title=The Art of Metal Gear Solid|pages=104–105}}&lt;/ref&gt; For most of ''Metal Gear Solid'', Liquid is dressed in a brown trenchcoat, but ultimately fights shirtless when he confronts Snake at the end of the game. When he disguises himself as Master Miller, he ties his hair in a ponytail and wears a pair of sunglasses, changing the tone of his voice as well. In ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', when Liquid possesses Ocelot, his physical appearance changes as well, exposing the surgically-attached right arm and letting his hair loose.

Eli in ''Metal Gear Solid V'' wears a wardrobe similar to his adult self, consisting of a green jacket with no shirt and shorts. The back of his jacket has a drawing of a pig with an [[eye patch]] meant to resemble Big Boss and the phrase "Never Be Game Over" atop of it. Underneath the pig, the kanji 液体人間 (''ekitai ningen''), which means "liquid person", can be seen.

===Casting===
In the original ''Metal Gear Solid'', Liquid Snake was voiced by [[Banjo Ginga]] in the Japanese version and by [[Cam Clarke]] (credited as James Flinders in the PlayStation release) in the English version. Both actors would reprise the role in ''Metal Gear Solid 2'', where Liquid's personality takes over mind of Revolver Ocelot, who switches between his natural voice (provided by [[Koji Totani]] in the Japanese version and [[Pat Zimmerman]] in English) and Liquid's. Due to the death of Koji Totani in 2005, the role of Ocelot was taken over by Banjo Ginga in the Japanese version of ''Metal Gear Solid 4'' and the idea of Revolver Ocelot switching personalities between his natural self and Liquid's persona was abandoned in favor of having Liquid completely take over Ocelot's mind, forming a new entity named Liquid Ocelot. Despite this, Pat Zimmerman continued to voice Ocelot in the English version of ''Metal Gear Solid 4'', with Cam Clarke's voice only being used through uncredited use of his performances from previous games. Stuntman [[Mark Musashi]] provided Liquid Snake's motion capture for ''[[Metal Gear Solid: The Twin Snakes]]''.

Eli, the young version of Liquid Snake in ''Metal Gear Solid V'', was voiced by Piers Stubbs, who also provided facial capture, while his motion capture was performed by Vincent Giry. Yūtarō Honjō dubbed the character's voice for the Japanese version.

===Naming===
Liquid Snake is the second character introduced in the series bearing the "Snake" codename, following Solid Snake himself. His codename is meant to reflect his nature as Solid Snake's opposite. However, because Solid Snake, already an established character from the previous games, is known simply as "Snake" by most of the cast, Liquid Snake himself is referred primarily as "Liquid" by other characters and even within the game's mission logs. His FOXHOUND comrades simply acknowledge him as "Boss".

His real name is revealed to be Eli in ''The Phantom Pain'', with "Nyoka ya Mpembe" or "White Mamba" being his nickname among other child soldiers. The name "Eli" has been likened to the biblical character [[Eliab]], the eldest of [[David|King David]]'s seven brothers, an allusion to Solid Snake's real name (David) and the six other brothers who were aborted during the cloning process that led to his and Liquid's creation.

==Reception==

The following is a '''list of sports team names and mascots derived from terms used to refer to specific [[ethnic groups]]''', and words or iconography derived from different languages or traditions of these groups. Many such names are derived from ancestral groups of the same ethnicity as many of the current fans or players, such as the [[Boston Celtics]] ([[Irish people|Irish]]) and the [[Minnesota Vikings]] ([[History of Scandinavia|Scandinavian]]). Since ethnicity is defined by social identity there may be differences of opinion regarding membership in a particular group, and the appropriateness of the use of such references by others. Ethnicity was once distinct from [[Race (human categorization)|''race'']] when the latter was thought to refer to biological distinctiveness as well as cultural differences. However, the biological basis for race has been largely abandoned by academic disciplines, leaving race as another social constructed concept for dividing people into groups based upon shared experience and history as well as physical characteristics.
In the United States and Canada, many sports team names and mascots refer to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas]].

The '''Mariam Cannon Hayes School of Music''' is part of ''[[Appalachian State University]]'' and is one of the premier public [[music schools]] in the eastern [[United States]]. A fully accredited member of the [[National Association of Schools of Music]], the Hayes School of Music offers undergraduate programs in [[music education]], music performance, theory/composition, sacred music performance, [[music therapy]], and music industry studies as well as Master of Music degrees in performance, [[music education]], and [[music therapy]]. Particularly distinguished for its music performance, [[music education]], and [[music therapy]] programs, the Hayes School of Music draws students and faculty from across the United States and the world. Through summer workshops and specialized course offerings (e.g. the North Carolina Summer Institute of Choral Arts), the Hayes School of Music is engaged in year-round activities. In addition, the school also sponsors the Cannon Music Camp, an annual comprehensive summer music camp that trains younger, high-school-age musicians, during which the [[North Carolina Symphony]] is in residence.

==History==
The first music teacher at what was to become Appalachian State University was Lillie Shull Dougherty, the wife of University Business Manager and Co-founder D.D. Dougherty. From its beginning, Appalachian State University offered students instruction in voice and piano on an extracurricular basis, and by the late 1920s, choruses, glee clubs, and string bands were flourishing on the campus of what was then Appalachian State Teachers College. Students' increased interest in music led to Edith Knight joining the music faculty, and she broadened the musical offerings to include music education, music appreciation, and additional applied music courses. 

Knight was succeeded by Virginia Ward Linney in 1929, and the educational need to prepare specialists to teach music in the public schools led, a year later, to the creation of the Music Department, with Linney serving as chairperson. Soon afterward, courses in harmony, music education, music history and applied music were added to the curriculum. During the Depression years, when enrollment of the University fluctuated between 350 and 900 students in any given year, the college and surrounding area faced hard times. In spite of this, the Music Department continued to expand. More courses were added in order to educate music teachers with an emphasis on excellence in performance. To further this end, in 1939, Gordon Nash and J. Elwood Roberts began teaching band and orchestral instrument methods classes. Two years later, Roy R. Blanton and John B. Thompson were recipients of the first music education degrees conferred by Appalachian. 

As with other American colleges and universities in the early 1940s, Appalachian State Teachers College and its Music Department experienced reduced enrollment and a preponderantly female population (Note the number of women in the chamber orchestra photo from 1942). "The war has taken about all our boys," lamented university co-founder and president B.B. Dougherty in 1944. 

Postwar years, on the other hand, brought a time of growth and new enthusiasm at Appalachian as returning servicemen altered the demographics and psychology of the nation. 
In 1952, with Gordon Nash now at the helm, the Appalachian State Teachers College Music Department moved into a new fine arts building, and in 1953, the department joined the [[National Association of Schools of Music]].

From 1958 to 1972, during the tenure of [[William G. Spencer]] as Music Department chairman, Appalachian experienced considerable growth in both the number of students and the number of faculty. Student enrollment soared to above 2400 in 1958, only to double to over 5000 by 1968. In 1967, Appalachian, now officially Appalachian State University, became a regional university. Dr. Nicholas Erneston was appointed Dean of the newly organized College of Fine and Applied Arts (which included the Music Department), and in 1969 a proposal was presented to the [[North Carolina General Assembly]] to construct on campus a fine arts complex which would include an auditorium and buildings for art, music, speech, and drama.

With the induction of Appalachian State University into the [[University of North Carolina]] system in 1972, Chancellor Herbert W. Wey encouraged faculty members to be as creative as they dared. The Music Department met the challenge both with the engagement of world-class performers as applied music faculty, as well as with an explosion of creative ideas, enlivening the curriculum. One such campus-wide experiment from that era that continues to the present day is [[Watauga College]], a residential college with enhanced faculty-student relationships and interdisciplinary studies, which exists in an arts-centered environment within the greater University. The College, located near the School of Music, has served as the home for many of Appalachian's music students. Two other important developments of this period were the establishment of Appalachian’s New York Loft and the Appalachian House in Washington, D.C. These off-campus living environments are available to music students and faculty to pursue off-campus artistic and scholarly field trips and musical opportunities.

The current music complex, the [[Broyhill Music Center]], was completed in the spring of 1983. The Music Center includes two performance spaces, a 125-seat Recital Hall and 440-seat Concert Hall, a state-of-the-art recording studio, an [[opera]] studio, a fully equipped [[MIDI]]/electronic music studio, a computer lab, a [[piano]] lab, a {{convert|5000|sqft|m2|adj=on}} music library, an instrumental rehearsal hall, a choral rehearsal hall, several small ensemble rehearsal rooms, more than 30 studio/offices and over 40 practice rooms.

In 1988, the artistic and academic growth of the Department of Music resulted in its expansion into an autonomous School of Music (and separation from the College of Fine and Applied Arts). In 1989, [[Arthur Unsworth]] was named as the first dean of the School of Music. From the beginning of the 21st-century to June 30, 2009, the composer [[William Harbinson]], an alumnus of Appalachian, served as dean of the School of Music. James Douthit, a graduate of the Eastman School of Music (University of Rochester) currently serves as dean of the School of Music.

In May 2001, the late [[Mariam Cannon Hayes]] of [[Concord, NC]], who was a longtime patron of the arts and ardent supporter of the music program at Appalachian State University, made a $10 million endowment gift to the School of Music. Proceeds from her [[Financial endowment|endowment]] fund current and future needs of the School of Music and also provide funding for scholarly research and performance. 
Subsequently, the Appalachian State University Board of Trustees named the Hayes School of Music in her honor. In addition, Mariam Cannon Hayes had been a prime force behind the creation of The Mariam and Robert Hayes Performing Arts Center. The Center, an off-campus 350-seat facility especially designed for performances of musical theater, opera, and theater, was completed in August 2006 and hosts select School of Music performances.

==Today==
Over the course of little more than a century, Lillie Shull Dougherty's extracurricular music classes have evolved into what has become an artistic beacon for North Carolina, the Mariam Cannon Hayes School of Music. As does its famous northern counterpart, [[Juilliard]], Appalachian's Hayes School of Music owes a great deal to a patron of the arts connected to the textiles industry (Mariam Cannon Hayes is the daughter of [[Charles Albert Cannon]], the man recognized for making ''Cannon'' a brand name, while textile merchant [[Augustus Juilliard]] is that school's namesake).

'''My Saint Helena Island''' is the unofficial territorial anthem of [[Saint Helena]]. It was written by Dave Mitchell in 1975, after persuasion from the inhabitants of Saint Helena. As a British Overseas Territory the official anthem is "[[God Save the Queen]]".

Dave Mitchell, nicknamed “Old Saddlebags”, was a country &amp; western disc jockey on AFN Volcano Radio on [[Ascension Island]]. He was introduced to Saints on Ascension by his friend Charlie Renn, and became involved with them, playing for parties all over the island. Renn suggested that Mitchell write a song for St. Helena. Mitchell was reluctant to do so, as he had never been to St Helena, so Renn, who had visited the island, promptly brought Mitchell some large colour postcards of the island. After sitting in his room for a night or two studying the postcards, Mitchell picked up his guitar and in a few minutes the song was written. It is, appropriately, a country song.&lt;ref name="national1"&gt;http://sainthelenaisland.info/nationalsong.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

The song was an immediate hit with the Saints on Ascension. With the help of recording company Camaro Records, Mitchell made two 45-rpm records (four songs) in Memphis, Tennessee in 1975. He planned to make a trip to St. Helena to deliver the records in person, but this proved not to be possible, so he had to mail them instead. The reaction on St. Helena was as enthusiastic as that of the Saints on Ascension, and “My St. Helena Island” quickly became the de facto national song of St. Helena.&lt;ref name="national1"/&gt;

It is played regularly as a request on [[Saint FM Community Radio]], and was played over the now-decommissioned [[RMS St Helena (1989)|RMS ''St Helena'']]'s PA system every time it departed port.&lt;ref name="national1"/&gt;

The lyrics are:&lt;ref name="national1"/&gt;

1: My heart is drifting southward / To my home down in the sea / It’s the isle of St. Helena / Where my loved ones wait for me / Long since I left it / But I’ll soon be going home / To my St. Helena island / And swear I’ll never roam

2: Diamonds they are pretty / So is your fancy cars / But St. Helena island / Is prettier by far / All the wonders of this world / I’m told they number seven / But St. Helena Island / Is the nearest one to heaven

3: Diamonds they are pretty / So is your fancy cars / But St. Helena island / Is prettier by far / Someday if the Lord above / Comes out of heaven’s gate / I’m sure He’ll pick St. Helena / And use it as His place

The gold colour represents the [[golden wattle]] (''Acacia pycnantha''), which is [[List of Australian floral emblems|Australia's national flower]]. The uniforms of Australia's national sports teams are usually green and gold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Australian Citizenship: Our common bond |location=Belconnen |publisher=National Communications Branch, Department of Immigration and Border Protection, Commonwealth of Australia |date=2014 |page=14 |url=https://www.border.gov.au/Citizenship/Documents/our-common-bond-2014.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The golden wattle flower, and the colours green and gold, are also featured on the [[Coat of arms of Australia]].

The Australian government states that, to be used correctly, the colours are placed side-by-side, with no other colour between them. The exact green and gold colours are specified as [[Pantone Matching System]] numbers 348C and 116C.&lt;ref name=DPMC/&gt; The colours are always referred to as 'green and gold', respectively.

Before 1984 three colour combinations unofficially represented Australia:&lt;ref name=DPMC/&gt;
* red, white and blue, 
* blue and gold, and
* green and gold.

According to the Australian government, "green and gold have been popularly embraced as Australia’s national sporting colours" since the late 1800s.&lt;ref name=DPMC/&gt; Nearly every current Australian national sports team wears them (although the hues and proportions of the colours may vary between teams and across eras).{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} Australia's cricket team first wore the colours in 1899, in the form of the [[baggy green]], the cap presented to Australian cricket players.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nsm.org.au/Whats%20On/Latest%20News/2013/July/More_Than_Green_and_Gold.aspx|title=History behind sporting colours uncovered|publisher=The National Sports Museum|date=26 July 2013|accessdate=17 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The first Australian national sporting team to wear green and gold was the [[Australian cricket team]] that toured England in 1899. Their clothes were the traditional white, but the captain [[Joe Darling]] arranged for green and gold caps and blazers to be worn for the opening match of the [[The Ashes|Ashes]] series. Previously, the team had had no uniform cap or blazer colours but wore an assortment of club or state colours.&lt;ref&gt;''The Weekend Australian'', 30–31 December 2000, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; The Australian cricket team continued to use the colours thereafter, and in 1908 the colours were ratified as the official team colours for future Australian cricket teams. During subsequent discussions by members of the [[New South Wales]] Cricket Association, the colours were reportedly referred to as "[[Eucalyptus|gum-tree]] green" and "[[Acacia pycnantha|wattle]]-gold". Australian national colours have switched between green and blue often throughout history causing some Australians to confuse the two.

The [[Australasia]]n Olympic team adopted "green and wattle" in 1908, but not every team played in the colours. In the [[1912 Summer Olympics|1912 Olympics]], an official Australian uniform was adopted for the first time: green vests with gold trimming, and white shorts with green and gold trimming.

Of the football codes, the [[Australia national soccer team|Australian national soccer team]] first wore green and gold in 1924 with the [[Australian national rugby league team]] and [[Australia national rugby union team]] following in 1928 and 1929 respectively.&lt;ref name="eveningnews-soccer"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article119214234? | title=To-day's Diary – Fashion and the Game | work=Evening News | date=10 May 1924 | accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=[[Sean Fagan|Fagan, Sean]]|title=To Wattle Gold and Gum Green Jerseys|url=http://rl1908.com/Kangaroos/arl-colours.htm|work=RL1908.com|accessdate=7 April 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110514024646/http://rl1908.com/Kangaroos/arl-colours.htm|archivedate=14 May 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aru-history"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.rugby.com.au/tryrugby/Playing/RugbyExplained/History.aspx | title=History of Rugby | publisher=Australian Rugby Union | accessdate=19 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1961, the Wallabies have worn a gold jersey with green lettering and trim; they changed from a primarily green jersey to avoid a colour clash with the [[South Africa national rugby union team|Springboks]] of South Africa.

===Companies and organisations===
From around 1981 the colours were also used in the [[livery]] of the government railway body [[Australian National Railways Commission|Australian National]], formed by the 1970s merger of [[Commonwealth Railways]] with the state-run [[South Australian Railways]] and [[Tasmanian Government Railways]]. Australian National was privatised in 1997.

'''Northwest Coast art''' is the term commonly applied to a style of art created primarily by artists from [[Tlingit people|Tlingit]], [[Haida people|Haida]], [[Heiltsuk]], [[Nuxalk]], [[Tsimshian]], [[Kwakwaka'wakw]], [[Nuu-chah-nulth people|Nuu-chah-nulth]] and other [[First Nations]] and [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes of the [[Pacific Northwest|Northwest Coast]] of North America, from pre-European-contact times up to the present.

== Distinguishing characteristics ==
[[File:Namgis (Native American). Thunderbird Transformation Mask, 19th century.jpg|thumb|Namgis, ''Thunderbird Transformation Mask'', 19th century. The Thunderbird is believed to be an Ancestral Sky Being of the Namgis clan of the [[Kwakwaka’wakw]], who say that when this bird ruffles its feathers, it causes thunder and when it blinks its eyes, lightning flashes. [[Brooklyn Museum]]]]
Two-dimensional Northwest Coast art is distinguished by the use of [[formlines]], and the use of characteristic shapes referred to as ''ovoids'', ''U forms'' and ''S forms''.  Before European contact, the most common media were wood (often [[Western red cedar]]), stone, and copper; since European contact, paper, canvas, glass, and precious metals have also been used.  If paint is used, the most common colours are red and black, but yellow is also often used, particularly among [[Kwakwaka'wakw]] artists.&lt;ref name="Bill1"&gt;Bill Holm, Northwest Coast Indian Art: An Analysis of Form.  University of Washington Press, Seattle, 1965&lt;/ref&gt; [[Chilkat weaving]] applies formline designs to textiles. Tlingit, Haida, and Tsimshian have traditionally produced Chilkat woven regalia, from wool and yellow cedar bark, that is important for civic and ceremonial events, including potlatches.

The patterns depicted include natural forms such as bears, ravens, eagles, orcas, and humans; [[legendary creature]]s such as [[Thunderbird (mythology)|thunderbirds]] and [[sisiutl]]s; and abstract forms made up of the characteristic Northwest Coast shapes.  [[Totem poles]] are the most well-known artifacts produced using this style.  Northwest Coast artists are also notable for producing characteristic "bent-corner" or "bentwood" boxes, masks, and canoes.  Northwest Coast designs were also used to decorate traditional First Nations household items such as spoons, ladles, baskets, hats, and paddles; since European contact, the Northwest Coast art style has increasingly been used in gallery-oriented forms such as paintings, prints and sculptures.

[[File:Mary Ebbets Hunt - Chilkat blanket.jpg|thumb|Mary Ebbets Hunt - Chilkat blanket]]
{{quote|Although highly conventionalized decorative design occurs all along the coast, to the south and north of this center the representational motive becomes progressively stronger. Krickeberg (1925: 144) characterizes this as a fresh naturalism to the south among the Kwakiutl, Nootka, and Salish and a certain relationship to Eskimo engraving and painting among the Tlingit to the north. The shift in emphasis is gradual - Bella Bella art, for example, has a close affinity to its Coast Tsimshian counterpart. Two-dimensional art of all these groups, however, is much more closely related than is their sculpture, especially among the northern tribes of Tlingit, Haida, Tsimshian, and Bella Bella.&lt;ref&gt;Holm, Bill. Northwest Coast Indian Art: An analysis of Form. Thomas Burke Memorial Washington State Museum Monograph No. 1. Douglas &amp; McIntyre. Vancouver/Toronto. 1965. p. 20. {{ISBN|0-88894-172-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Textile arts from the Northwest Coast include [[Chilkat weaving]], Raven's Tail Weavings, Button Blankets, and elaborate ceremonial regalia using a range of materials. Three dimension art was created from many materials, notably wood.

== History ==
Prior to contact with Europeans, First Nations on the Northwest coast evolved complex social and ceremonial institutions, including the [[potlatch]] system, hereditary systems of rank and descent, ceremonial societies, and permanent villages. Social organization involved groups of kin, reckoned variously matrilineally, patrilineally or bi-lineally. These groups hold various tangible and intangible rights and properties. Among them are origin stories. Many instances of Northwest coast art are visual references to these stories. 

After European contact, in the late 18th century, the peoples who produced Northwest Coast art suffered huge population losses due to diseases such as smallpox, and cultural losses due to colonization and assimilation into European-North [[Culture of the United States|American culture]].  The production of their art dropped drastically as well.

Toward the end of the 19th century, Northwest Coast artists began producing work for commercial sale, such as small [[argillite]] carvings.  The end of the 19th century also saw large-scale export of totem poles, masks and other [[Painting|traditional art]] objects from the region to museums and private collectors around the world.  Some of this export was accompanied by financial compensation to people who had a right to sell the art, and some was not.

In the early 20th century, very few First Nations artists in the Northwest Coast region were producing art.  A tenuous link to older traditions remained in artists such as Charles Gladstone, Henry Speck, Ellen Neel, Stanley George, and [[Mungo Martin]].  The mid-20th century saw a revival of interest and production of Northwest Coast art, due to the influence of historians, artists and critics including [[Bill Reid]], a grandson of Charles Gladstone and [[Bill Holm (art historian)|Bill Holm]]. A revival of traditional ceremonial ways also drove the increased production of traditional arts. This time also saw an increasing demand for the return of art objects that were illegally or immorally taken from First Nations communities.  This demand continues to the present day.  Today, there are numerous art schools teaching formal Northwest Coast art of various styles, and there is a growing market for new art in this style.&lt;ref name="Jack2"&gt;Jonathan Meuli. Shadow House: Interpretations of Northwest Coast Art {{ISBN|90-5823-083-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The revival of ceremonial life, following the lifting of the potlatch ban - have also driven production of traditional clothing, painting and carving for use in ceremonies.

== Cultural appropriateness ==

Although neighbouring peoples such as the [[Coast Salish peoples]] also traditionally produced art which shares some characteristics of Northwest Coast art, these styles of art are not usually included in the term, since the patterns and artifacts produced are rather different.  For example, Salish peoples traditionally created standing welcome figures not created by other Northwest Coast peoples, did not traditionally create totem poles, and did not traditionally use the form lines and shapes of other Northwest Coast peoples.&lt;ref name="Gill1"&gt;Hilary Stewart.  ''Looking at Totem Poles''.  Douglas &amp; McIntyre, Vancouver/Toronto, 1993&lt;/ref&gt;  One corollary of this fact is that — contrary to popular belief — other than some of the peoples of the [[Olympic Peninsula]], no [[Federally recognized tribes|Native American nations]] of Washington and Oregon states produced totem poles and other characteristic, formline, Northwest Coast-style art objects before European contact.&lt;ref name="Hill1"&gt;Hilary Stewart,''Looking at Indian Art of the Northwest Coast''.  Douglas &amp; McIntyre, Vancouver/Toronto, 19795&lt;/ref&gt;

Traditionally, within a given community, some patterns and motifs could be used only by certain families and lineages, or with the agreement of those families and lineages.  Today, in [[British Columbia]], it is a point of contention whether only [[First Nations]] artists of the appropriate nation have the moral right to produce art of given types and using given motifs, or whether only the intent of the person and the respect given to the respective peoples are significant. Likewise, in Ontario, similar controversies have arisen over whether non-Native artists have the moral right to make use of Native motifs and visual art styles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nasser |first1=Shanifa |title=Toronto gallery cancels show after concerns artist 'bastardizes' Indigenous art |url=https://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/toronto/toronto-gallery-indigenous-art-cancels-amandapl-1.4091529 |website=CBC |accessdate=21 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some non-Native artists, such as John Livingston, have been adopted into First Nations and have thus formally acquired the right to produce such art.&lt;ref name="Bill1"/&gt;  In some nations, such as the Haida, adoptions are seen by some only as gestures, and production of work in their trademark style by outsiders may, in some contexts, be viewed as economic and cultural appropriation.

==Notable art historians and thinkers==
Notable academics and publishers of northwest Northwest Coast include [[Bill Holm (art historian)|Bill Holm]], [[Bill Reid]], [[Hilary Stewart]], Bill McLennan, [[Martha Black (art historian)|Martha Black]], and [[George F. MacDonald]]. [[Doreen Jensen]] and Polly Sargent's book ''Robes of Power'' (1986) deals with ceremonial robes - called [[Button blanket]] - and their history and forms. Cheryl Samuel and her book ''The Raven's Tail'' (1987) describes northern weaving style known as Raven's Tail - used to make ceremonial robes and other regalia. 

[[Emily Carr]], though she did not formally adopt the techniques, commonly used native art as the motif of many of her early paintings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13141">[[Image:Manuscript Thet Oera Linda Bok, pagina 48.jpg|thumb|280px|Page 48 of the Oera Linda manuscript]]
The '''Oera Linda Book''' is a manuscript written in a form of [[Old Frisian]], purporting to cover historical, mythological, and religious themes of remote antiquity, from 2194 BCE to 803 CE. Among academics in [[Germanic philology]], the document is widely considered to be a [[hoax]] or [[forgery]].

The manuscript first came to public awareness in the 1860s. In 1872, Jan Gerhardus Ottema published a Dutch translation and defended it as genuine. Over the next few years there was a heated public controversy, but by 1879 it was universally accepted that the text was a recent composition. Nevertheless, a public controversy was revived in the context of 1930s [[Nazi occultism]], and the book is still occasionally brought up in esotericism and [[Atlantis]] literature. The manuscript's author is not known with certainty, hence it is unknown whether the intention was to produce a [[hoax]], a [[parody]] or simply an exercise in poetic fantasy.

Historian Goffe Jensma published a monograph on the manuscript in 2004, ''De gemaskerde god'' ("The Masked God"), including a new translation and a discussion of the history of its reception. Jensma concludes that it was probably intended as a "hoax to fool some nationalist [[Frisia|Frisians]] and orthodox Christians", as well as an "experiential exemplary exercise" by Dutch theologian and poet [[Piet Paaltjens|François Haverschmidt]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://historischhuis.nl/recensiebank/review/show/414] {{ISBN|90-6550-841-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''Zeker ook nieuw aan mijn boek is wat ik op grond van het handschrift zelf kon concluderen over de tijd van ontstaan en over de wijze waarop het is gemaakt, namelijk in een aantal fases en niet door één auteur, maar zeker door twee en vermoedelijk door drie auteurs.''

The Oera Linda Book, known in [[Old Frisian]] as ''Thet Oera Linda Bok'', came to light in 1867 when Cornelis Over de Linden (1811&amp;ndash;1874) handed the manuscript, which he claimed to have inherited from his grandfather, via his aunt, over to Eelco Verwijs (1830&amp;ndash;1880), the provincial librarian of Friesland, for translation and publication. Verwijs rejected the manuscript, but in 1872 Jan Gerhardus Ottema (1804&amp;ndash;1879), a prominent member of the Frisian Society for History and Culture, published a Dutch translation. Ottema believed it to be written in authentic [[Old Frisian]]. The book was subsequently translated into English by William Sandbach in 1876, and published by Trübner &amp; Co. of London.

Within the first few years after the appearance of the Oera Linda Book, its recent origin was established not only based on the exceptional claims being made, but also because of a number of anachronisms it contained. The text was nevertheless a source of inspiration for a number of occultists and speculative historians. While there was some debate among Dutch academics and in a number of newspapers about the book's authenticity during the 1870s, by 1879 it was widely recognized as a forgery.

===Nazi Germany===
More than forty years later, beginning in 1922, Dutch ''[[völkisch]]'' philologist [[Herman Wirth]] revived the issue. Wirth published a German translation of what he dubbed the "Nordic Bible" in 1933, as ''Die Ura Linda Chronik''.

A panel discussion on Wirth's book at the University of Berlin on 4 May 1934 was the immediate impulse for the foundation of the [[Ahnenerbe]] Nazi "[[think tank]]" by [[Heinrich Himmler|Himmler]] and Wirth, together with [[Richard Walther Darré]]. Because of the infatuation of Himmler with the Oera Linda Book and its consequent association with Nazi occultism, it became known as "Himmler's Bible". Wirth's book was by no means universally acclaimed among the Nazi-era Nordicist academics, and the 1934 panel discussion was steeped in heated controversy. [[Alfred Rosenberg]] and his circle rejected it. [[Gustav Neckel]] had praised Wirth's work before publication, but upon seeing its content published a dismayed recension.&lt;ref&gt;''Der Tag'', Berlin,  31. December 1933.&lt;/ref&gt;

Speaking in defense of the book's authenticity were [[Walther Wüst]] and [[Otto Huth]], besides Wirth himself. Speaking against its authenticity were Neckel, Karl Hermann Jacob-Friesen (who identified it as a satirical hoax by Linden) and [[Arthur Hübner]]. Hübner was one of the most respected Germanists of his generation, and his verdict of the Oera Linda being a falsification settled the defeat of Wirth's party. The public defeat of Himmler's scholarly brand of "esoteric Nordicism" resulted in the foundation of Ahnenerbe, which attracted occultists such as [[Karl Maria Wiligut]] and was viewed with suspicion by the mainstream National Socialist ideologues of [[Amt Rosenberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Gerd Simon, [http://homepages.uni-tuebingen.de/gerd.simon/himmlerbibel.pdf Himmlers Bibel und die öffentlichkeitswirksamste Podiumsdiskussion in der Geschichte der Germanistik]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern esotericism===
The book experienced a revival of popularity in the English-speaking world with the writings of Robert Scrutton. In ''The Other Atlantis'' (1977) he reproduced the full text of Sandbach's 1876 English translation, interspersed with his own commentaries on history and mythology.&lt;ref&gt;Scrutton, Robert. ''The Other Atlantis'' (1977) {{ISBN|0-72217-665-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Secrets of Lost Atland'' (1979) he became the first to link the book with the concept of [[earth mysteries]], and, in particular, [[ley lines]] and [[telluric current|telluric energy]].&lt;ref&gt;Scrutton, Robert. ''Secrets of Lost Atland'' (1979) {{ISBN|0-72217-667-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following Scrutton's example, English language accounts of the Oera Linda Book tend to place it within the [[New Age]] or [[alternate history]] genres, and do not associate it with National Socialism, as is the case in Germany.

Another figure to formulate a contemporary [[Modern Paganism|Neopagan]] tradition influenced by the Oera Linda Book was Tony Steele, who considered the book to reveal the genuine truth about the ancient European [[megalith|megalithic culture]]. In ''Water Witches'' (1998) he examined the book's use as a cultural identity marker by the Frisian-descended canal folk of the [[The Midlands|English Midlands]].&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Tony. ''Water Witches'' (1998) {{ISBN|1-86163-049-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''The Rites and Rituals of Traditional Witchcraft'' (2001) he connected the religious practices of the priestesses described in the book with later medieval [[witchcraft]] traditions.&lt;ref&gt;Steele, Tony. ''The Rites and Rituals of Traditional Witchcraft'' (2001) {{ISBN|1-86163-140-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Authorship==
Among those who doubt the book's authenticity, the most popular candidates for the author of the manuscript are Cornelis Over de Linden or Eelco Verwijs. A recent third choice is the Protestant preacher François Haverschmidt (1835&amp;ndash;1894), well known for writing poetry under the pseudonym Piet Paaltjens. Haverschmidt lived in Friesland and was an acquaintance of Verwijs.&lt;ref&gt;[http://skepsis.nl/oeralinda/ Skepsis.nl]&lt;/ref&gt;

Goffe Jensma (2004) argued that Haverschmidt was the main writer of the book, with the help of Over de Linden and Verwijs. According to Jensma, Haverschmidt intended the Oera Linda Book as a parody of the [[Christianity|Christian]] [[Bible]]. An article in late 2007 by Jensma&lt;ref&gt;Extraordinary professor of Frisian Language and Culture, in particular the literary-historical aspects of Frisian, at the Faculty of Humanities of the [[Universiteit van Amsterdam]]&lt;/ref&gt; says that the three authors of the translation intended it "to be a temporary hoax to fool some nationalist Frisians and orthodox Christians and as an experiential exemplary exercise in reading the Holy Bible in a non-fundamentalist, symbolical way."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rug.nl/news/2004/11/122_00?lang=en ''Oera Linda-boek was poging van Haverschmidt om bijbel te ontkrachten''] [[Rijks Universiteit Groningen]], 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Ignoring clues that it was a forgery, J. G. Ottema took it seriously, and it achieved popularity for the reasons given above. Its creators felt unable to admit that they had written it, and it became the foundation for new occult beliefs. Jensma concludes his article by saying "It is a perfect irony that a book written to unmask the Holy Bible as a book of human making was to become a bible itself."&lt;ref name="Jensma"&gt;{{Citation|title=How to Deal with Holy Books in an Age of Emerging Science.

==Contents==
Themes running through the Oera Linda Book include [[catastrophism]], [[nationalism]], [[matriarchy]], and [[mythology]]. The text alleges that Europe and other lands were, for a large part of their history, ruled by a succession of folk-mothers presiding over a hierarchical order of celibate priestesses dedicated to the goddess [[Frijjo|Frya]], daughter of the creator god Wr-alda and Jrtha, the earth mother. The claim is also made that this Frisian civilization possessed an alphabet that was the ancestor of the [[Greek alphabet|Greek]] and [[Phoenician alphabet]]s. Modern [[historiography]] is essentially ignored, particularly in the area of basic chronology of known events in the recent and distant past of Europe. Geological as well as geographical evidence that was readily available even as far back as Over de Linden's time is also mostly absent from the manuscript.

The earliest portion of the Oera Linda Book, namely ''Frya’s Tex'', was supposedly composed in 2194 BC, whereas the most recent part, the letter of Hidde Oera Linda, dates to AD 1256. Almost half of the entire book comprises ''The Book of Adela’s Followers'', the original text around which the rest grew. It is purported to have been compiled in the 6th century BC from a mixture of contemporary writings and ancient inscriptions. The last two sections of the Oera Linda Book contain a number of [[lacuna (manuscripts)|lacunae]] and the book itself breaks off in mid-sentence.

It also describes a lost land called [[Atlantis|Atland]] (the name given to Atlantis by the 17th century scholar [[Olof Rudbeck]]), which was supposedly submerged in 2194 BC, the same year as 19th century Dutch and Frisian almanacs, following traditional Biblical chronology given for [[Deluge (mythology)|Noah's flood]].&lt;ref name="Jensma"/&gt;

===Sections===

The Oera Linda Book is divided into six sections, further subdivided into a total of 53 chapters.

* Letters

'''Osman Hamdi Bey''' (30 December 1842{{spaced ndash}}24 February 1910) was an [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] administrator, intellectual, art expert and also a prominent and pioneering painter. He was also an accomplished [[archaeologist]], and is regarded as the pioneer of the [[curator|museum curator]]'s profession in [[Turkey]]. He was the founder of [[Istanbul Archaeology Museums]] and of ''Istanbul Academy of Fine Arts'' ([[:tr:Sanayi-i Nefise Mektebi|Sanayi-i Nefise Mektebi]] in [[Turkish language|Turkish]]), known today as the [[Mimar Sinan University of Fine Arts]].

==Early life==
Osman Hamdi was the son of [[Ibrahim Edhem Pasha]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Shaw, Wendy M.

[[File:Osman hamdi genclik.jpg|thumb|185px|right|Osman Hamdi in his youth]]

Osman Hamdi went to primary school in the popular [[Istanbul]] quarter of [[Beşiktaş]];&lt;ref&gt;''The Encyclopædia Britannica'', Vol.7, Edited by Hugh Chisholm, (1911), 3; "''Constantinople, the capital of the Turkish Empire...''".&lt;/ref&gt; after which he studied Law, first in Istanbul (1856) and then in [[Paris]] (1860). However, he decided to pursue his interest in painting instead, left the Law program, and trained under [[France|French]] [[orientalism|orientalist]] painters [[Jean-Léon Gérôme]] and [[Gustave Boulanger]].&lt;ref&gt;Wendy M.K. Shaw, Possessors and Possessed: Museums, Archaeology, and visualisation of history in the late Ottoman Empire. University of California Press 2003, p. 98 {{ISBN|0-520-23335-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his nine-year stay in Paris, the international capital of fine arts at the time, he showed a keen interest for the artistic events of his day.&lt;ref&gt;Bloom J. and Blair, S., ''The Grove Encyclopedia of Islamic Art and Architecture,'' Oxford University Press, 2009 Vol. 3, p.361&lt;/ref&gt;

His stay in Paris was also marked by the first ever visit by an [[List of sultans of the Ottoman Empire|Ottoman sultan]] to [[Western Europe]], when [[Abdülaziz|Sultan Abdülaziz]] was invited to the [[Exposition Universelle (1867)]] by [[Napoleon III of France|Emperor Napoleon III]]. He also met many of the [[Young Ottomans]] in Paris, and even though he was exposed to their liberal ideas, he did not participate in their political activities, being the son of an Ottoman [[pasha]] who was loyal to the [[sultan]] and did not challenge the old [[absolute monarchy|absolutist system]]. Osman Hamdi Bey also met his first wife Marie, a French woman, in Paris when he was a student. After receiving his father's blessings, she accompanied him to Istanbul (Constantinople) when he returned in 1869, where the two got married and had two daughters.

Once back in Turkey, he was sent to the [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] province of [[Baghdad]] as part of the administrative team of [[Midhat Pasha]] (the leading political figure and reformer among the [[Young Ottomans]] who enacted the [[First Constitutional Era (Ottoman Empire)|First Ottoman Constitution]] in 1876, Midhat Pasha served as the [[Grand Vizier]] between [[List of Ottoman Grand Viziers|1876–1877]], before being replaced by İbrahim Edhem Pasha, Osman Hamdi Bey's father.)&lt;ref name="W. Shaw, p. 98"&gt;W. Shaw, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; In 1871, Osman Hamdi returned to Istanbul, as the vice-director of the Protocol Office of the Palace. During the 1870s, he worked on several assignments in the upper echelons of the Ottoman bureaucracy.

==Career==
{{double image|right|Eşi Naile Hanım - Osman Hamdi.jpg|109|Osman Hamdi Bey - Naile Hanım Portresi , Portrait of Naile Hanım - Google Art Project.jpg|120|Two portraits by Osman Hamdi Bey of his second wife Marie, who later took the name Naile Hanım.&lt;ref name=Posta&gt;[http://www.posta.com.tr/pazarpostasi/HaberDetay/Asik-oldugu-iki-kadinin-adi-da-Marie-ydi---.htm?ArticleID=46171 "Aşık olduğu iki kadının adı da Marie'ydi..."], Posta.com.tr, 11 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; The name of his first wife was also Marie, and both of them were [[France|French]].&lt;ref name=Posta/&gt; From his first wife Marie, whom he met in [[Paris]], he had two daughters named Fatma and Hayriye.&lt;ref name=Posta/&gt; From his second wife Marie (Naile Hanım), whom he met in [[Vienna]], he had three daughters named Melek, Leyla and Nazlı, and one son named Edhem.&lt;ref name=Posta/&gt;|}}

Osman Hamdi exhibited three paintings at the [[International Exposition (1867)|1867 Paris Exposition Universelle]].&lt;ref name="W. Shaw, p. 98"/&gt; None seem to have survived today, but their titles were ''Repose of the Gypsies'', ''Black Sea Soldier Lying in Wait'', and ''Death of the Soldier''.
An important step in his career was his assignment as the director of the Imperial Museum (Müze-i Hümayun) in 1881. He used his position as museum director to develop the museum and rewrite the antiquities laws and to create nationally sponsored archaeological expeditions. In 1882, he instituted and became director of the [[Mimar Sinan Fine Arts University|Academy of Fine Arts]], which provided Ottomans with training in aesthetics and artistic techniques without leaving the empire.&lt;ref&gt;W. Shaw, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt; In 1884, he oversaw the promulgation of a Regulation prohibiting historical artifacts from being smuggled abroad ''(Asar-ı Atîka Nizamnamesi)'', a giant step in constituting a legal framework of preservation of the antiquities. Representatives or middlemen of 19th-century European Powers routinely smuggled artifacts with historical value from within the boundaries of the Ottoman Empire (which then comprised the geographies of [[ancient Greek]] and [[Mesopotamian]] civilizations, among others), often resorting to shadily obtained licenses or bribes, to enrich museums in European capitals.

He conducted the first scientific based archaeological researches done by a Turkish team. His digs included sites as varied as the [[Commagene]] tomb-sanctuary in [[Nemrut Dağı]] in southeastern [[Anatolia]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://1886.u-bordeaux-montaigne.fr/items/show/76325|title=Le Tumulus de Nemroud-Dagh : voyage, description, inscriptions ... {{!}} 1886 - Collections patrimoniales numérisées de Bordeaux Montaigne|website=1886.u-bordeaux-montaigne.fr|language=fr|access-date=2018-01-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; (a top tourist's venue in Turkey and a [[UNESCO]] [[World Heritage Site]] today, within the [[Adıyaman Province]]), the [[Hekate]] [[sanctuary]] in [[Lagina]] in southwestern Anatolia (much less visited, and within the [[Muğla Province]] today), and [[Sidon]] in [[Lebanon]]. The [[sarcophagus|sarcophagi]] he discovered in Sidon (including the one known as the [[Alexander Sarcophagus]], although this sarcophagus is thought to contain the remains of either [[Abdalonymus]], King of [[Sidon]]; or [[Mazaeus]], a Persian noble who was also the governor of [[Babylon]]) are considered among the worldwide jewels of archaeological findings. To lodge these, he started building what is today the [[Istanbul Archaeology Museum]] in 1881. The museum officially opened in 1891 under his directorship.

Throughout his professional career as museum and academy director, Osman Hamdi continued to paint in the style of his teachers, Gérôme and Boulanger.

==''The Tortoise Trainer''==
His 1906 painting, ''[[The Tortoise Trainer]]'', broke a record in Turkey&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/osman-hamdis-lost-masterpiece-in-auction-.aspx?pageID=238&amp;nID=65652&amp;NewsCatID=385|title=Osman Hamdi’s 'lost' masterpiece in auction|access-date=22 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; by being sold for the amount of 3.5 million [[dollars]] in December 2004. The painting expresses a sarcastic [[innuendo]] on the painter's own view of his style of work compared to those of his collaborators and apprentices, and is also a reference to the historical fact of tortoises having been employed for illuminative and decorative purposes, by placing candles on the shell, in evening outings during the [[Tulip Era in the Ottoman Empire|Tulip Era]] in the early 18th century. The painting was acquired by the Suna and İnan Kıraç Foundation and is currently on display at the [[Pera Museum]] in [[İstanbul]], which was established by this foundation.

Modern researchers have identified  the animals portrayed are ''[[Testudo graeca]] ibera'', a variety of the Spur-thighed tortoise. A reproduction of the painting appeared on the cover of the ''[[Bibliotheca Herpetologica]]'' issue in which the paper about the identification was published.&lt;ref&gt;Bettelheim, Matthew P. and Ertan Taskavak. 2006. "The Tortoise and the Tulip – Testudo graeca ibera and Osman Hamdi's ''The Tortoise Trainer''". ''[[Bibliotheca Herpetologica]]''. 6(2): pp 11–15. The paper is mentioned, and the magazine cover is shown, at [http://www.t-ad.net/ishbh/pub.html ISHBH publication list]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Progress''' is the idea that advances in [[technology]], [[science]], and [[social organization]] can produce an improvement in the [[human condition]], and therefore that entire [[societies]], and humanity in general, can improve in terms of their social, political, and economic structures.&lt;ref&gt;Simandan, D., 2018. Being surprised and surprising ourselves: a geography of personal and social change. Progress in Human Geography, OnlineFirst, pp. 1-20, https://doi.org/10.1177/0309132518810431 .&lt;/ref&gt;  This may happen as a result of direct human action, as in [[social enterprise]] or through [[activism]], or as a natural part of [[sociocultural evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, R., 2017. History of the Idea of Progress. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt;

The concept of progress was introduced in the early 19th century [[social theory|social theories]], especially [[social evolution]] as described by [[Auguste Comte]] and [[Herbert Spencer]]. It was present in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]]'s [[philosophy of history|philosophies of history]]. As a goal, social progress has been advocated by varying realms of political ideologies with different theories on how it is to be achieved.

==Measuring progress==
Specific indicators for measuring progress can range from economic data, technical innovations, change in the political or legal system, and questions bearing on individual life chances, such as life expectancy and risk of disease and disability.&lt;ref&gt;Slaboch, M.W., 2017. A Road to Nowhere: The Idea of Progress and Its Critics. University of Pennsylvania Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[GDP]] growth has become a key orientation for politics and is often taken as a key figure to evaluate a politician's performance. However, GDP has a number of flaws that make it a bad measure of progress, especially for developed countries. For example, environmental damage is not taken into account nor is the [[sustainability]] of economic activity. [[Wikiprogress]] has been set up to share information on evaluating societal progress. It aims to facilitate the exchange of ideas, initiatives and knowledge. [http://www.humanprogress.org/ HumanProgress.org] is another online resource that seeks to compile data on different measures of societal progress.

The [[Social Progress Index]] is a tool developed by the International Organization Imperative Social Progress, which measures the extent to which countries cover social and environmental needs of its citizenry. There are fifty-two indicators in three areas or dimensions: Basic Human Needs, and Foundations of Wellbeing and Opportunities which show the relative performance of nations.

Indices that can be used to measure progress include:
{{div col}}
* [[Broad measures of economic progress]]
* [[Disability-adjusted life year]]
* [[Green national product]]
* [[Gender-related Development Index]]
* [[Genuine Progress Indicator]]
* [[Gross National Happiness]]
* [[Gross National Well-being]]
* [[Happy Planet Index]]
* [[Human Development Index]]
* [[Legatum Prosperity Index]]
* [[Social Progress Index]]
* [[OECD Better Life Index]]
* [[Subjective life satisfaction]]
* [[Where-to-be-born Index]]
* [[Wikiprogress]]
* [[World Happiness Report]]
* [[World Values Survey]]

==Scientific progress==
{{see also|History of science|Technological change|Invention}}
'''Scientific progress''' is the idea that the scientific community learns more over time, which causes a body of [[scientific knowledge]] to accumulate.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Wesseling|first=Henk|date=August 1998|title=History: Science or art?|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/european-review/article/history-science-or-art/1D3620AE5FCD4AA371AC99E352260E68|journal=European Review|language=en|volume=6|issue=3|pages=265–267|doi=10.1017/S106279870000329X|issn=1474-0575|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The chemists in the 19th century knew less about chemistry than the chemists in the 20th century, and they in turn knew less than the chemists in the 21st century. Looking forward, today's chemists reasonably expect that chemists in future centuries will know more than they do.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  

This process differs from [[non-science]] fields, such as human languages or history:  the people who spoke a now-extinct language, or who lived through a historical time period, can be said to have known different things from the scholars who studied it later, but they cannot be said to know less about their lives than the modern scholars.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Some valid knowledge is lost through the passage of time, and other knowledge is gained, with the result that the non-science fields do not make scientific progress towards understanding their subject areas.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

From the 18th century through late 20th century, the history of science, especially of the physical and biological sciences, was often presented as a progressive accumulation of knowledge, in which true theories replaced false beliefs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Golinski |first=Jan  |year=2001 |title=Making Natural Knowledge: Constructivism and the History of Science |edition= reprint |publisher=University of Chicago Press |isbn=9780226302324 |page=2 | quote=When [history of science] began, during the eighteenth century, it was practiced by scientists (or "natural philosophers") with an interest in validating and defending their enterprise.  They wrote histories in which ... the science of the day was exhibited as the outcome of the progressive accumulation of human knowledge, which was an integral part of moral and cultural development.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some more recent historical interpretations, such as those of [[Thomas Kuhn]], tend to portray the history of science in terms of competing paradigms or conceptual systems in a wider matrix of intellectual, cultural, economic and political trends. These interpretations, however, have met with opposition for they also portray the history of science as an incoherent system of incommensurable paradigms, not leading to any scientific progress, but only to the illusion of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhn, T., 1962, "The Structure of Scientific Revolutions", University of Chicago Press, p. 137: "Partly by selection and partly by distortion, the scientists of earlier ages are implicitly presented as having worked upon the same set of fixed problems and in accordance with the same set of fixed canons that the most recent revolution in scientific theory and method made seem scientific."&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social progress==
{{expand section|date=July 2018}}
Aspects of social progress, as described by [[Condorcet]], have included the disappearance of slavery, the rise of literacy, the lessening of inequalities between the sexes, reforms of harsh prisons and the decline of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert (1980). ''History of the Idea of Progress''. New York: Basic Books Ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Status of women===
How progress improved the degraded status of women in traditional society was a major theme of historians starting in the Enlightenment and continuing to today.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Ann Taylor (1999). "Feminism, Social Science, and the Meanings of Modernity: the Debate on the Origin of the Family in Europe and the United States, 1860–914," ''American Historical Review'' '''104''' (4): 1085–113; Nyland, Chris (1993). "Adam Smith, Stage Theory, and the Status of Women," ''History of Political Economy'' '''25''' (4): 617–40.&lt;/ref&gt; British theorists [[William Robertson (historian)|William Robertson]] (1721–1793) and [[Edmund Burke]] (1729–1797), along with many of their contemporaries, remained committed to Christian- and [[republicanism|republican-based]] conceptions of virtue, while working within a new Enlightenment paradigm. The political agenda related beauty, taste, and morality to the imperatives and needs of modern societies of a high level of sophistication and differentiation. Two themes in the work of Robertson and Burke—the nature of women in 'savage' and 'civilized' societies and 'beauty in distress'—reveals how long-held convictions about the character of women, especially with regard to their capacity and right to appear in the public domain, were modified and adjusted to the idea of progress and became central to an enlightened affirmation of modern European civilization.&lt;ref&gt;Kontler, László (2004). "Beauty or Beast, or Monstrous Regiments? Robertson and Burke on Women and the Public Scene," ''Modern Intellectual History'' '''1''' (3): 305–30.&lt;/ref&gt;

Classics experts have examined the status of women in the ancient world, concluding that in the Roman Empire, with its superior social organization, internal peace, and rule of law, allowed women to enjoy a somewhat better standing than in ancient Greece, where women were distinctly inferior.&lt;ref&gt;Dimand, Robert William, &amp; Chris Nyland (2003). ''The Status of Women in Classical Economic Thought''.Edward Elgar Publishing, p. 109; Ryrie, Charles Caldwell (1958). ''The Place of Women in the Church'', The Macmillan Company, Ch 1.&lt;/ref&gt; The inferior status of women in traditional China has raised the issue of whether the idea of progress requires a thoroughgoing reject of traditionalism—a belief held by many Chinese reformers in the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Vernoff, Edward, &amp; Peter J. Seybolt, (2007). ''Through Chinese Eyes: Tradition, Revolution, and Transformation'', APEX Press, pp. 45ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historians Leo Marx and [[Bruce Mazlish]] asking, "Should we in fact abandon the idea of progress as a view of the past," answer that there is no doubt "that the status of women has improved markedly" in cultures that have adopted the Enlightenment idea of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Marx, Leo, &amp; Bruce Mazlish (1998). ''Progress: Fact or Illusion?''. Ann Arbor: University of Michigan Press, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modernization==
{{main|Modernization}}
Modernization was promoted by [[classical liberals]] in the 19th and 20th centuries, who called for the rapid modernization of the economy and society to remove the traditional hindrances to free markets and free movements of people.&lt;ref&gt;Appleby, Joyce; Lynn Hunt, and Margaret Jacob (1995). ''Telling the Truth about History''. W.W. Norton, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] in Europe [[social commentary|social commentators]] and [[philosopher]]s began to realize that people ''themselves'' could change society and change their way of life. Instead of being made completely by gods, there was increasing room for the idea that people themselves ''made their own society''—and not only that, as [[Giambattista Vico]] argued, ''because'' people made their own society, they could also fully comprehend it. This gave rise to new sciences, or [[proto-science]]s, which claimed to provide new scientific knowledge about what society was like, and how one may change it for the better.&lt;ref&gt;The following annotated reference list appears in [[J. B. Bury]]'s study: ''The Idea of Progress,'' published in 1920 and [https://www.gutenberg.org/files/4557/4557-h/4557-h.htm available in full on the web]:
{{Quote|The history of the idea of Progress has been treated briefly and partially by various French writers; e.g. Comte, {{lang|fr|Cours de philosophie positive}}, vi. 321 sqq.; Buchez, {{lang|fr|Introduction a la science de l'histoire}}, i. 99 sqq. (ed. 2, 1842); Javary, {{lang|fr|De l'idee de progres}} (1850); Rigault, {{lang|fr|Histoire de la querelle des Anciens et des Modernes}} (1856); Bouillier, {{lang|fr|Histoire de la philosophie cartesienne}} (1854); Caro, {{lang|fr|Problemes de la morale sociale}} (1876); Brunetiere, "{{lang|fr|La Formation de l'idee de progres|italic=no}}", in {{lang|fr|Etudes critiques}}, 5e serie. More recently M. Jules Delvaille has attempted to trace its history fully, down to the end of the eighteenth century. His {{lang|fr|Histoire de l'idee de progres}} (1910) is planned on a large scale; he is erudite and has read extensively. But his treatment is lacking in the power of discrimination. He strikes one as anxious to bring within his net, as {{lang|fr|theoriciens du progres}}, as many distinguished thinkers as possible; and so, along with a great deal that is useful and relevant, we also find in his book much that is irrelevant. He has not clearly seen that the distinctive idea of Progress was not conceived in antiquity or in the Middle Ages, or even in the Renaissance period; and when he comes to modern times he fails to bring out clearly the decisive steps of its growth. And he does not seem to realize that a man might be "progressive" without believing in, or even thinking about, the doctrine of Progress. Leonardo da Vinci and Berkeley are examples. In my ''Ancient Greek Historians'' (1909) I dwelt on the modern origin of the idea (p. 253 sqq.). Recently Mr. R. H. Murray, in a learned appendix to his ''Erasmus and Luther'', has developed the thesis that Progress was not grasped in antiquity (though he makes an exception of Seneca),—a welcome confirmation.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In turn, this gave rise to [[Progressivism|progressive]] opinion, in contrast with conservational opinion. The social conservationists were skeptical about [[panacea]]s for social ills. According to conservatives, attempts to radically remake society normally make things worse. [[Edmund Burke]] was the leading exponent of this, although later-day liberals like [[Friedrich Hayek|Hayek]] have espoused similar views. They argue that society changes organically and naturally, and that grand plans for the remaking of society, like the [[French Revolution]], [[National Socialism]] and [[Communism]] hurt society by removing the traditional constraints on the exercise of power.

The scientific advances of the 16th and 17th centuries provided a basis for [[Francis Bacon|Francis Bacon's]] book the [[New Atlantis]]. In the 17th century, [[Bernard le Bovier de Fontenelle]] described progress with respect to arts and the sciences, saying that each age has the advantage of not having to rediscover what was accomplished in preceding ages. The epistemology of [[John Locke]] provided further support and was popularized by the Encyclopedists [[Diderot]], [[Holbach]], and [[Condorcet]]. Locke had a powerful influence on the American [[Founding Fathers]].&lt;ref&gt;Pangle, Thomas L. (1990). ''The Spirit of Modern Republicanism: The Moral Vision of the American Founders and the Philosophy of Locke''. University of Chicago Press. {{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first complete statement of progress is that of [[Anne-Robert-Jacques Turgot, Baron de Laune|Turgot]], in his "A Philosophical Review of the Successive Advances of the Human Mind" (1750). For Turgot, progress covers not only the arts and sciences but, on their base, the whole of culture—manner, mores, institutions, legal codes, economy, and society. [[Condorcet]] predicted the disappearance of slavery, the rise of literacy, the lessening of inequalities between the sexes, reforms of harsh prisons and the decline of poverty.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert (1980). ''History of the Idea of Progress''. New York: Basic Books Ch. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Stuart Mill]]'s (1806–1873) ethical and political thought demonstrated faith in the power of ideas and of intellectual education for improving human nature or behavior. For those who do not share this faith the idea of progress becomes questionable.&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet (1980) pp. 224–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Alfred Marshall]] (1842–1924), a British economist of the early 20th century, was a proponent of classical liberalism. In his highly influential ''Principles of Economics'' (1890), he was deeply interested in human progress and in what is now called ''sustainable development.'' For Marshall, the importance of wealth lay in its ability to promote the physical, mental, and moral health of the general population.&lt;ref&gt;Caldari, Katia (2004). "Alfred Marshall's Idea of Progress and Sustainable Development," ''Journal of the History of Economic Thought'', '''26''' (4): 519–36.&lt;/ref&gt; After World War II, the modernization and development programs undertaken in the Third World were typically based on the idea of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Arndt, H. W. (1989). ''Economic Development: The History of an Idea''. University of Chicago Press. {{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Russia the notion of progress was first imported from the West by [[Peter the Great]] (1672–1725). An absolute ruler, he used the concept to modernize Russia and to legitimize his monarchy (unlike its usage in Western Europe, where it was primarily associated with political opposition). By the early 19th century, the notion of progress was being taken up by Russian intellectuals and was no longer accepted as legitimate by the tsars. Four schools of thought on progress emerged in 19th-century Russia: conservative (reactionary), religious, liberal, and socialist—the latter winning out in the form of Bolshevist materialism.&lt;ref&gt;Ellison, Herbert J. (1965). "Economic Modernization in Imperial Russia: Purposes and Achievements," ''Journal of Economic History'' '''25''' (4): 523–40.&lt;/ref&gt;

The intellectual leaders of the American Revolution, such as [[Benjamin Franklin]], [[Thomas Paine]], [[Thomas Jefferson]] and [[John Adams]], were immersed in Enlightenment thought and believed the idea of progress meant that they could reorganize the political system to the benefit of the human condition; both for Americans and also, as Jefferson put it, for an "[[Empire of Liberty]]" that would benefit all mankind.&lt;ref&gt;Commager, Henry Steele (1969). [http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44497969.pdf "The Past as an Extension of the Present,"] ''Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society'', Vol. 79, No. 1, pp. 17–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Juan Bautista Alberdi]] (1810–1884) was one of the most influential political theorists in Argentina. Economic liberalism was the key to his idea of progress. He promoted faith in progress, while chiding fellow Latin Americans for blind copying of American and European models. He hoped for progress through promotion of immigration, education, and a moderate type of federalism and republicanism that might serve as a transition in Argentina to true democracy.&lt;ref&gt;Dougherty, John E. (1973). "Juan Bautista Alberdi: A Study of His Thought," ''Americas'' '''29''' (4): 489–501.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Mexico, [[Jose Mora]] (1795–1856) was a leader of [[classical liberalism]] in the first generation after independence, leading the battle against the conservative trinity of the army, the church, and the ''hacendados''. He envisioned progress as both a process of human development by the search for philosophical truth and as the introduction of an era of material prosperity by technological advancement. His plan for Mexican reform demanded a republican government bolstered by widespread popular education free of clerical control, confiscation and sale of ecclesiastical lands as a means of redistributing income and clearing government debts, and effective control of a reduced military force by the government. Mora also demanded the establishment of legal equality between native Mexicans and foreign residents. His program, untried in his lifetime, became the key element in the Mexican Constitution of 1857.&lt;ref&gt;Hart, John M. (1972). "Jose Mora: His Idea of Progress and the Origins of Mexican Liberalism," ''North Dakota Quarterly'' '''40''' (2): 22–29.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Italy, the idea that progress in science and technology would lead to solutions for human ills was connected to the nationalism that united the country in 1860. The Piedmontese Prime Minister Camillo Cavour envisaged the railways as a major factor in the modernization and unification of the Italian peninsula. The new Kingdom of Italy, formed in 1861, worked to speed up the processes of modernization and industrialization that had begun in the north, but were slow to arrive in the Papal States and central Italy, and were nowhere in sight in the "Mezzogiorno" (that is, Southern Italy, Sicily, and Sardinia). The government sought to combat the backwardness of the poorer regions in the south and work towards augmenting the size and quality of the newly created Italian army so that it could compete on an equal footing with the powerful nations of Europe. In the same period, the government was legislating in favour of public education to fight the great problem of illiteracy, upgrade the teaching classes, improve existing schools, and procure the funds needed for social hygiene and care of the body as factors in the physical and moral regeneration of the race.&lt;ref&gt;DalLago, Enrico (2002). ''The American South and the Italian Mezzogiorno: Essays in Comparative History''. Palgrave Macmillan.&lt;/ref&gt;

In China, in the 20th century the [[KMT]] or Nationalist party, which ruled from the 1920s to the 1940s, advocated progress. The Communists under [[Mao Zedong]] adopted western models and their ruinous projects caused mass famines. After Mao's death, however, the new regime led by [[Deng Xiaoping]] (1904–1997) and his successors aggressively promoted modernization of the economy using capitalist models and imported western technology.&lt;ref&gt;Smirnov, Dmitry (2004). "Deng Xiaoping and the Modernization of China," ''Far Eastern Affairs'' '''32''' (4): 20–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among environmentalists, there is a continuum between two opposing poles. The one pole is optimistic, progressive, and business-oriented, and endorses the classic idea of progress. For example, [[bright green environmentalism]] endorses the idea that new designs, social innovations and green technologies can solve critical environmental challenges. The other is pessimistic in respect of technological solutions,&lt;ref&gt;Huesemann, Michael H., and Joyce A. Huesemann (2011). [http://www.newtechnologyandsociety.org ''Technofix: Why Technology Won’t Save Us or the Environment''], Chapter 9, "Technological Optimism and Belief in Progress", New Society Publishers, Gabriola Island, British Columbia, Canada, {{ISBN|0865717044}}, 464 pp.&lt;/ref&gt; warning of impending global crisis (through [[climate change]] or [[peak oil]], for example) and tends to reject the very idea of modernity and the myth of progress that is so central to modernization thinking.&lt;ref&gt;Jamison, Andrew (2001). ''The Making of Green Knowledge: Environmental Politics and Cultural Transformation''. Cambridge University Press, pp 28ff.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, [[Kirkpatrick Sale]], wrote about progress as a myth benefiting the few, and a pending environmental doomsday for everyone.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primitivism.com/facets-myth.htm Five Facets of a Myth]&lt;/ref&gt; An example is the philosophy of [[Deep Ecology]].

==Philosophy==
Sociologist [[Robert Nisbet]] said that "No single idea has been more important than ... the Idea of Progress in Western civilization for three thousand years",&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet (1980) p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and defines five "crucial premises" of the idea of progress:
# value of the past
# nobility of Western civilization
# worth of economic/technological growth
# faith in reason and scientific/scholarly knowledge obtained through reason
# intrinsic importance and worth of life on earth

Sociologist [[P. A. Sorokin]] said, "The ancient Chinese, Babylonian, Hindu, Greek, Roman, and most of the medieval thinkers supporting theories of rhythmical, cyclical or trendless movements of social processes were much nearer to reality than the present proponents of the linear view".&lt;ref&gt;P. A. Sorokin, 1932 paper, quoted in Fay (1947).&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike Confucianism and to a certain extent Taoism, that both search for an ideal past, the Judeo-Christian-Islamic tradition believes in the fulfillment of history, which was translated into the idea of progress in the modern age. Therefore, Chinese proponents of modernization have looked to western models. According to Thompson, the late Qing dynasty reformer, Kang Youwei, believed he had found a model for reform and "modernisation" in the Ancient Chinese Classics.&lt;ref&gt;Youwei, Kang, &amp; Lawrence G. Thompson (1958). ''Ta T'ung Shu: The One World Philosophy of Kang Yu-wei.'' London: Allen &amp; Unwin.&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosopher [[Karl Popper]] said that progress was not fully adequate as a scientific explanation of social phenomena.&lt;ref&gt;Popper (1957). ''The Poverty of Historicism''. Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, [[Kirkpatrick Sale]], a self-proclaimed [[neo-luddism|neo-luddite]] author, wrote exclusively about progress as a myth, in an essay entitled "Five Facets of a Myth".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.primitivism.com/facets-myth.htm Five Facets of a Myth]&lt;/ref&gt;

Iggers (1965) says that proponents of progress underestimated the extent of man's destructiveness and irrationality, while critics misunderstand the role of rationality and morality in human behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Iggers (1965) p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1946, psychoanalyst [[Charles Baudouin]] claimed modernity has retained the "corollary" of the progress myth, the idea that the present is superior to the past, while at the same time insisting that it is free of the myth:
{{quote|sign=|source=|
The last two centuries were familiar with the myth of progress. Our own century has adopted the myth of modernity. The one myth has replaced the other. ...

Men ceased to believe in progress; but only to pin their faith to more tangible realities, whose sole original significance had been that they were the instruments of progress. ..

This exaltation of the present ... is a corollary of that very faith in progress which people claim to have discarded. The present is superior to the past, by definition, only in a mythology of progress. Thus one retains the corollary while rejecting the principle. There is only one way of retaining a position of whose instability one is conscious. One must simply refrain from thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[[Charles Baudouin]], ''The Myth of Modernity'', ''Le Mythe du moderne'' (1946), as translated by [[Bernard Miall]] (1950), sections 1–7.&lt;/ref&gt;
}}

A cyclical theory of history was adopted by [[Oswald Spengler]] (1880–1936), a German historian who wrote ''[[The Decline of the West]]'' in 1920. [[World War I]], [[World War II]], and the rise of [[totalitarianism]] demonstrated that progress was not automatic and that technological improvement did not necessarily guarantee democracy and moral advancement. British historian [[Arnold J. Toynbee]] (1889–1975) felt that Christianity would help modern civilization overcome its challenges.&lt;ref&gt;Farrenkopf, John (1993). "Spengler's Historical Pessimism and the Tragedy of our Age," ''Theory and Society'' Vol. 22, Number 3, pp. 391–412.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Jeffersonians said that history is not exhausted but that man may begin again in a new world. Besides rejecting the lessons of the past, they Americanized the idea of progress by democratizing and vulgarizing it to include the welfare of the common man as a form of [[republicanism]]. As Romantics deeply concerned with the past, collecting source materials and founding historical societies, the Founding Fathers were animated by clear principles. They saw man in control of his destiny, saw virtue as a distinguishing characteristic of a republic, and were concerned with happiness, progress, and prosperity. Thomas Paine, combining the spirit of rationalism and romanticism, pictured a time when America's innocence would sound like a romance, and concluded that the fall of America could mark the end of 'the noblest work of human wisdom.'&lt;ref&gt;Commager, Henry Steele (1969). [http://www.americanantiquarian.org/proceedings/44497969.pdf "The Past as an Extension of the Present,"] ''Proceedings of the American Antiquarian Society'', Vol. 79, No. 1, pp. 17–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Historian [[J. B. Bury]] wrote in 1920:&lt;ref&gt;Bury (1920). [https://archive.org/stream/ideaofprogressin00buryuoft#page/n7/mode/2up ''The Idea of Progress'']. London: Macmillan and Co., p. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|To the minds of most people the desirable outcome of human development would be a condition of society in which all the inhabitants of the planet would enjoy a perfectly happy existence....It cannot be proved that the unknown destination towards which man is advancing is desirable. The movement may be Progress, or it may be in an undesirable direction and therefore not Progress..... The Progress of humanity belongs to the same order of ideas as Providence or personal immortality. It is true or it is false, and like them it cannot be proved either true or false. Belief in it is an act of faith.}}

In the [[postmodernist]] thought steadily gaining ground from the 1980s, the grandiose claims of the modernizers are steadily eroded, and the very concept of social progress is again questioned and scrutinized.  In the new vision, radical modernizers like [[Joseph Stalin]] and [[Mao Zedong]] appear as [[totalitarian]] despots, whose vision of social progress is held to be totally deformed.  Postmodernists question the validity of 19th century and 20th century notions of progress—both on the capitalist and the Marxist side of the spectrum. They argue that both capitalism and Marxism over-emphasize technological achievements and material prosperity while ignoring the value of inner [[happiness]] and [[Wiktionary:peace of mind|peace of mind]]. Postmodernism posits that both dystopia and utopia are one and the same, overarching grand narratives with impossible conclusions.

{{anchor|Myth of Progress}}{{see also|Progress trap}}
Some 20th-century authors refer to the "Myth of Progress" to refer to the idea that the human condition will inevitably improve. In 1932, English physician [[Montague David Eder]] wrote: "The myth of progress states that civilization has moved, is moving, and will move in a desirable direction. Progress is inevitable... Philosophers, men of science and politicians have accepted the idea of the inevitability of progress."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| last= David Eder | first=Montague | year=1932 | title=The Myth of Progress | journal=D. Eder. 'the Myth of Progress.' the British Journal of Medical Psychology 1932, Vol. Xii, P. 1.. Int. J. Psycho-Anal | volume=14 | pages=399 | url = http://www.pep-web.org/document.php?id=IJP.014.0399A}}&lt;/ref&gt; Eder argues that the advancement of civilization is leading to greater unhappiness and loss of control in the environment. The strongest critics of the idea of progress complain that it remains a dominant idea in the 21st century, and shows no sign of diminished influence. As one fierce critic, British historian [[John N. Gray|John Gray]] (b. 1948), concludes:&lt;ref&gt;Gray, John (2004). "An Illusion with a Future," ''Daedalus'' Vol. 133(3), pp 10+; also Gray (2004). ''Heresies: Against Progress and Other Illusions''. Granta Books.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|Faith in the liberating power of knowledge is encrypted into modern life. Drawing on some of Europe's most ancient traditions, and daily reinforced by the quickening advance of science, it cannot be given up by an act of will. The interaction of quickening scientific advance with unchanging human needs is a fate that we may perhaps temper, but cannot overcome... Those who hold to the possibility of progress need not fear. The illusion that through science humans can remake the world is an integral part of the modern condition. Renewing the eschatological hopes of the past, progress is an illusion with a future.}}

Recently the idea of progress has been generalized to psychology, being related with the concept of a goal, that is, progress is understood as "what counts as a means of advancing towards the end result of a given defined goal."&lt;ref&gt;Cerbaro, R. H. and Whisler, J. L. (2016). The Idea of Progress: A Theoretical and Concise Goal-Structure Model. Current Research in Psychology, 7 (1): 12.15, p. 13. DOI: 10.3844/crpsp.2016.12.15   [http://thescipub.com/PDF/crpsp.2016.12.15.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antiquity===

Historian [[J. B. Bury]] said that thought in [[ancient Greece]] was dominated by the theory of world-cycles or the doctrine of eternal return, and was steeped in a belief parallel to the Judaic "[[Original sin|fall of man]]," but rather from a preceding "[[Golden Age]]" of innocence and simplicity. Time was generally regarded as the enemy of humanity which depreciates the value of the world. He credits the [[Epicureanism|Epicureans]] with having had a potential for leading to the foundation of a theory of progress through their materialistic acceptance of the [[atomism]] of [[Democritus]] as the explanation for a world without an intervening [[deity]].
{{cquote|For them, the earliest condition of men resembled that of the beasts, and from this primitive and miserable condition they laboriously reached the existing state of civilisation, not by external guidance or as a consequence of some initial design, but simply by the exercise of human intelligence throughout a long period.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}}}

[[Robert Nisbet]] and [[Gertrude Himmelfarb]] have attributed a notion of progress to other Greeks. [[Xenophanes]] said "The gods did not reveal to men all things in the beginning, but men through their own search find in the course of time that which is better." [[Plato]]'s Book III of ''[[The Laws]]'' depicts humanity's progress from a state of nature to the higher levels of culture, economy, and polity. Plato's ''[[Statesman (dialogue)|The Statesman]]'' also outlines a historical account of the progress of mankind.

===Renaissance===
During the Medieval period, science was to a large extent based on [[Scholasticism|Scholastic]] (a method of thinking and learning from the [[Middle Ages]]) interpretations of [[Aristotle|Aristotle's]] work. The Renaissance of the 15th, 16th and 17th Centuries changed the mindset in Europe towards an empirical view, based on a [[pantheistic]] interpretation of [[Plato]]. This induced a revolution in curiosity about nature in general and scientific advance, which opened the gates for technical and economic advance. Furthermore, the individual potential was seen as a never-ending quest for being God-like, paving the way for a view of Man based on unlimited perfection and progress.&lt;ref&gt;Cassirer, Ernst; Paul Oskar Kristeller and John Herman Randall (eds., 1948). ''The Renaissance Philosophy of Man''. Chicago: University of Chicago Press.{{page needed|date=July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Enlightenment (1650–1800)===
{{Main|Age of Enlightenment}}
In the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]], French historian and philosopher [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) was a major proponent.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}} At first Voltaire's thought was informed by the idea of progress coupled with rationalism. His subsequent notion of the historical idea of progress saw science and reason as the driving forces behind societal advancement.

[[Immanuel Kant]] (1724–1804) argued that progress is neither automatic nor continuous and does not measure knowledge or wealth, but is a painful and largely inadvertent passage from barbarism through civilization toward enlightened culture and the abolition of war. Kant called for education, with the education of humankind seen as a slow process whereby world history propels mankind toward peace through war, international commerce, and [[enlightened self-interest]].&lt;ref&gt;Schuler, Jeanne A. (1991). "Reasonable Hope: Kant as Critical Theorist," ''History of European Ideas'', '''21''' (4): 527–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

Scottish theorist [[Adam Ferguson]] (1723–1816) defined human progress as the working out of a divine plan, though he rejected predestination. The difficulties and dangers of life provided the necessary stimuli for human development, while the uniquely human ability to evaluate led to ambition and the conscious striving for excellence. But he never adequately analyzed the competitive and aggressive consequences stemming from his emphasis on ambition even though he envisioned man's lot as a perpetual striving with no earthly culmination. Man found his happiness only in effort.&lt;ref&gt;Bernstein, John Andrew (1978). "Adam Ferguson and the Idea of Progress," ''Studies in Burke and His Time'' '''19''' (2): 99–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some scholars consider the idea of progress that was affirmed with the Enlightenment, as a [[secularization]] of ideas from early [[Christianity]], and a reworking of ideas from [[ancient Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=NIZfQTd3nSMC&amp;pg=PA402 The Blackwell Encyclopaedia of Political Thought] By David Miller, Janet Coleman, p.402.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nisbet, Robert (1980). ''History of the Idea of Progress''. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ludwig Edelstein takes a minority view in seeing evidence for ''The Idea of Progress in Classical Antiquity'', Johns Hopkins Press (1967).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romanticism===
In the 19th century, Romantic critics charged that progress did not automatically better the human condition, and in some ways could make it worse.&lt;ref&gt;Murray, Christopher John, ed. (2004). ''Encyclopedia of the Romantic Era, 1760–1850''. Fitzroy Dearborn, Vol.  II, p. 912.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Thomas Malthus]] (1766–1834) reacted against the concept of progress as set forth by William Godwin and Condorcet because he believed that inequality of conditions is "the best (state) calculated to develop the energies and faculties of man". He said, "Had population and food increased in the same ratio, it is probable that man might never have emerged from the savage state". He argued that man's capacity for improvement has been demonstrated by the growth of his intellect, a form of progress which offsets the distresses engendered by the law of population.&lt;ref&gt;Levin, Samuel M. (1966). "Malthus and the Idea of Progress," ''Journal of the History of Ideas'' '''27''' (1): 92–108.&lt;/ref&gt;

German philosopher [[Friedrich Nietzsche]] (1844–1900) criticized the idea of progress as the 'weakling's doctrines of optimism,' and advocated undermining concepts such as faith in progress, to allow the strong individual to stand above the plebeian masses. An important part of his thinking consists of the attempt to use the classical model of 'eternal recurrence of the same' to dislodge the idea of progress.&lt;ref&gt;Tassone, Giuseppe (2002). ''A Study on the Idea of Progress in Nietzsche, Heidegger and Critical Theory''. E. Mellen Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Iggers (1965) argues there was general agreement in the late 19th century that the steady accumulation of knowledge and the progressive replacement of conjectural, that is, theological or metaphysical, notions by scientific ones was what created progress. Most scholars concluded this growth of scientific knowledge and methods led to the growth of industry and the transformation of warlike societies into an industrial and pacific one. They agreed as well that there had been a systematic decline of coercion in government, and an increasing role of liberty and of rule by consent. There was more emphasis on impersonal social and historical forces; progress was increasingly seen as the result of an inner logic of society.&lt;ref&gt;Iggers, George G. (1965). "The Idea of Progress: A Critical Reassessment," ''American Historical Review'', Vol. 71, No. 1, pp. 1–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marxist theory (late 19th century)===
Marx developed a theory of [[historical materialism]]. He describes the mid-19th century condition in ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'' as follows:

{{Quote|The bourgeoisie cannot exist without constantly revolutionizing the instruments of production, and thereby the relations of production, and with them the whole relations of society. Conservation of the old modes of production in unaltered form, was, on the contrary, the first condition of existence for all earlier industrial classes. Constant revolutionizing of production, uninterrupted disturbance of all social conditions, everlasting uncertainty, and agitation distinguish the bourgeois epoch from all earlier ones. All fixed, fast frozen relations, with their train of ancient and venerable prejudices and opinions, are swept away, all new-formed ones become antiquated before they can ossify. All that is solid melts into air, all which is holy is profaned, and man is at last compelled to face with sober senses his real condition of life and his relations with his kind.&lt;ref&gt;Manifesto of the Communist Party: Chapter 1, Marx &amp; Engels&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Furthermore, Marx described the process of social progress, which in his opinion is based on the interaction between the productive forces and the relations of production:

{{Quote|No social order is ever destroyed before all the productive forces for which it is sufficient have been developed, and new superior relations of production never replace older ones before the material conditions for their existence have matured within the framework of the old society.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Marx|first=Karl|title=Preface|url=http://www.marxists.org/archive/marx/works/1859/critique-pol-economy/preface.htm|work=Critique of political economy}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[Capitalism]] is thought by Marx as a process of continual change, in which the growth of markets dissolve all fixities in human life, and Marx admits that capitalism is progressive and non-[[reactionary]]. [[Marxism]] further states that capitalism, in its quest for higher profits and new markets, will inevitably sow the seeds of its own destruction. Marxists believe that, in the future, capitalism will be replaced by [[socialism]] and eventually communism.

{{cquote|The reasonable man adapts himself to the world. The unreasonable man persists in trying to adapt the world to himself. Therefore, all progress depends on the unreasonable man.|4=[[George Bernard Shaw]]}}

Many advocates of capitalism such as [[Joseph Schumpeter|Schumpeter]] agreed with Marx's analysis of capitalism as a process of continual change through [[creative destruction]], but, unlike Marx, believed and hoped that capitalism could essentially go on forever.

Thus, by the beginning of the 20th century, two opposing schools of thought—Marxism and liberalism—believed in the possibility and the desirability of continual change and improvement. Marxists strongly opposed capitalism and the liberals strongly supported it, but the one concept they could both agree on was [[modernism]], a trend of thought which affirms the power of human beings to make, improve and reshape their society, with the aid of scientific knowledge, technology and practical experimentation.

Bhabha]] explains racial fetishism as a version of racist stereotyping, which is woven into colonial discourse and based on multiple/contradictory and splitting beliefs, similar to the disavowal which Freud discusses.  Bhabha defines colonial discourse as that which activates the simultaneous "recognition and disavowal of racial/cultural/historical differences" and whose goal is to define the colonized as 'other,' but also as fixed and knowable stereotypes. Racial fetishism involves contradictory belief systems where the 'other' is both demonized and idolized.&lt;ref name="Bhabha" /&gt;

Feminist writer [[Anne McClintock]] is interested in opening up the discourse of fetishism to stray away from the phallus and the scene of castration. One of her central arguments is that although race, class, and gender are all different and articulated categories of being, they always exist "''in and through'' relation to each other," and therefore discussions of racial fetishism also always have to do with class and gender as well.&lt;ref name="McClintock" /&gt;  McClintock does

&lt;blockquote&gt;not see racial fetishism as stemming from an overdetermined relation to the castration scene. Reducing racial fetishism to the phallic drama runs the risk of flattening out the hierarchies of social difference, thereby relegating race and class to secondary status along a primarily sexual signifying chain".&lt;ref name=McClintock /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Fetishism can take multiple forms and has branched off to incorporate different races. English naturalist and geologist, [[Charles Darwin]], can offer some observations in regards to why some people might find other races more attractive than their own. Attraction can be viewed as a mechanism for choosing a healthy mate. People's minds have evolved to recognize aspects of other peoples' biology that makes them an appropriate or good mate. This area of theory is called optimal outbreeding hypothesis.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.sbs.com.au/news/article/2014/05/13/cross-cultural-dating-why-are-some-people-only-attracted-one-ethnicity|title=Cross-cultural dating: Why are some people only attracted to one ethnicity?|work=News|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples==
=== White women ===
==== Fetishism of white women in China ====
[[File:Slavoj Zizek Fot M Kubik May15 2009 10.jpg|thumb|Slavoj Zizek (2009)]]
Following the globalization of China, the perception of Westerners changed drastically. As China opened up to the outside world, representations of Westerners shifted from enemies of China to individuals of great power, money and pleasure.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Johansson|first=Perry|date=1999-11-01|title=Consuming the other: The fetish of the western woman in Chinese advertising and popular culture|journal=Postcolonial Studies|volume=2|issue=3|pages=377–388|doi=10.1080/13688799989661|issn=1368-8790}}&lt;/ref&gt; The white woman, according to [[Slavoj Žižek]], Slovenian psychoanalytic philosopher and researcher at the [[University of Ljubljana]], has become fetishized in modern Chinese society as a result of her perceived role in the globalized commodity culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Plague of Fantasies|last=Zizek|first=Slavoj|publisher=Verso|year=1997|isbn=978-1844673032|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study of Chinese advertisements from 1990 to 1995, marketed solely to the Chinese people, it was concluded that in China, white women are symbols of strength and sexuality. The body language expressed by Chinese models demonstrate subordination, defined by the covering of faces and the tilting of heads. On the contrary, Chinese advertisements depict white women as powerful and uninhibited. They stare straight into the camera, do not cover their mouths while laughing, and hold their heads high.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to [[Rey Chow]], cultural critic and professor at [[Duke University]], the fetishism of white women in Chinese media does not have to do with sex; instead Chow describes it as a type of commodity fetishism. White women are seen as a representation of what China does not have: an image of a woman as something more than the heterosexual opposite to man.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Third World Women and the Politics of Feminism|last=Chow|first=Rey|publisher=Indiana University Press|year=1991|isbn=978-0-253-20632-9|editor-last=Mohanty|editor-first=Chandra Talpade|location=|pages=86|editor-last2=Russo|editor-first2=Ann|editor-last3=Torres|editor-first3=Lourdes}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, Perry Johansson, author of the ''Postcolonial Studies Journal'' article, "Consuming the other: The fetish of the western woman in Chinese advertising and popular culture," argues that the racial fetish of white women in Chinese culture does have something to do with sex. White women represent a shift in the power dynamics between women and men. As a result, white women are a source of fear.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Asian women ===
According to an article from the ''Washington and Lee Journal of Civil Rights and Social Justice'', the "Asian fetish" syndrome is born out of the male desire for dominance and the stereotype of Asian women as individuals open to domination.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Woan|first=Sunny|date=|title=White Sexual Imperialism: A Theory of Asian Feminist Jurisprudence|url=http://scholarlycommons.law.wlu.edu/crsj/vol14/iss2/5/|journal=Washington and Lee Journal of Civil Rights and Social Justice|volume=14|issue=2|issn=1535-0843}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, following the 1970s and a peak in the American feminist movement, many white men turned to [[mail-order bride]] companies in search of a loyal, understanding, and subservient partner. They saw women of their own race as too career-oriented and strong-willed. Asian women were the antithesis to their perception of white women.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; While white women resisted powerlessness and subjugation to the white man, Asian women were seen as open to the subjugation, even depicted as enjoying it.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The song "Yellow Fever" by [[The Bloodhound Gang]] includes lyrics such as, "She's an oriental rug cause I lay her where I please," and "Then I blindfold her with dental floss and get down on her knees."&lt;ref&gt;''Yellow Fever''. Bloodhound Gang. 1996. Song.&lt;/ref&gt; Both of these instances exemplify the stereotype of Asians as submissive.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Okumura|first=Ritsuko|date=|title=Yellow Fever|url=|journal=The Asian/Pacific American Women's Journal|volume=10|pages=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margaret Cho has labeled [[Gwen Stefani]]'s [[Harajuku Girls]] as a "minstrel show" because they represent [[Stereotypes of East Asians in the United States|fetishized East Asian stereotypes]].&lt;ref name="Cho"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://margaretcho.com/2005/10/31/harajuku-girls/|title=Harajuku Girls|last=Cho|first=Margaret|authorlink=Margaret Cho|website=Margaretcho.com|accessdate=25 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The girls follow Stefani around on tour and are contractually obligated not to speak English in public.&lt;ref name="Ahn"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.salon.com/2005/04/09/geisha_2/|title=Gwenihana|last=Ahn|first=Mihi|work=Salon|accessdate=15 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The performer had "renamed" them corresponding to her album title and clothing brand, L.A.M.B.: Love, Angel, Music, and Baby.&lt;ref name="Ahn" /&gt;

Furthermore, there have been many cases of Asian fetishism leading to criminal activity. In one case in 2000, two men, David Dailey and Edmund Ball, abducted and blindfolded two Japanese girls in Washington, one who was eighteen and the other who was nineteen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2000/dec/31/local/me-6906|title=Abduction and Rape of 2 Japanese Students Outrages Spokane|last=GERANIOS|first=NICHOLAS K.|date=2000-12-31|work=Los Angeles Times|access-date=2017-04-22|issn=0458-3035}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ball specifically targeted these Asian students because he thought that they were submissive and were less likely to report sexual abuse.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20010531&amp;slug=mukogawa31m|title=Local News {{!}} Rapists bet on victims' silence - and lose {{!}} Seattle Times Newspaper|website=community.seattletimes.nwsource.com|access-date=2017-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another case, in 2005, Michael Lohman, a doctoral student at Princeton University, was charged by the state of New Jersey for reckless endangerment, theft, harassment as well as tampering with a food product. Michael had cut locks of hair off at least nine Asian women. He also poured his semen and urine into the drinks of Asian Princeton students more than fifty times. In his apartment, Michael also had mittens filled with hairs of Asian women.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://yaledailynews.com/blog/2005/04/14/for-asian-women-fetish-is-less-than-benign/|title=For Asian women, 'fetish' is less than benign|access-date=2017-04-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Black women and men ===
After the Civil War, black men were more commonly falsely accused for the rape of white women compared to white men. Sexual relationships between black men and white women were frowned upon.&lt;ref&gt;Hodes, Martha.&amp;nbsp;''White women, black men''. Yale University Press, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1986, [[Robert Mapplethorpe]] had a photographic art show titled Black Males, showing photographs of naked black men exclusively. This work has been highly criticized for fetishizing the black male body, notably by [[Kobena Mercer]] in his aforementioned essay. Though it was not necessarily the artist's intention to portray these men as fetishized objects, they have been perceived that way by many audiences, especially in relation to some of his other works concerning gay male [[BDSM]] practices. The latter works examine an actual subculture of sexuality that is enacted by the photographic subjects: the men in the photos are wearing/using their own gear and clothing, putting their fetish(es) on display.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; However, in Mapplethorpe's photos of black men, the subjects are not doing anything but existing as nude bodies, they are hyper-sexualized by the camera, therefore they become the fetish objects.&lt;ref name=Mercer/&gt;

The fetishization of black women expanded during the [[Colonial Era]], as some white male slave owners raped their black, female slaves. They justified their actions by labeling the women as hyper-sexual property. These labels solidified into what is commonly referred to as the "[[Jezebel]]" stereotype.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn M West. "Mammy, Jezebel, Sapphire and their homegirls: Developing an "oppositional gaze" toward the images of Black women" 4thNew York''Lectures on the psychology of women''&amp;nbsp;(2008) p. 286 - 299&amp;nbsp;&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charmaine Nelson]] discusses the way black females are presented in paintings, with an emphasis on nude paintings. Nelson argues that every nude painting feeds into the voyeuristic male gaze, but the way black women are painted has even more undertones." The black female body defies the white male subject's desire for a single subject of 'pure' origin in two ways: firstly, through a sexual 'otherness' as woman, and secondly through a racial and colour 'otherness' as black. It is the combined power of these two markers of social location which has enabled western artists to represent black women at the margins of societal boundaries of propriety." The black woman is considered a fetish in these paintings and she is only viewed in a sexual lens.&lt;ref name=Mercer/&gt;

One of the more recent popular discourses around the fetishization of black women surrounds the release of [[Nicki Minaj]]'s popular song, "[[Anaconda (Nicki Minaj song)|Anaconda]]" in 2014. The entire song and music video revolves around the largeness of black women's bottoms. While some praise Minaj's work for its embrace of female sexuality, many{{Clarify|reason="many" is vague. What was the sample set for "many"? The general population? Fans? Philosophers?|date=July 2018}} believe that this song continues to reduce black women to be the focus of the male gaze.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2014/aug/22/nicki-minaj-anaconda-video-black-women-sexuality|title=Shocked and outraged by Nicki Minaj's Anaconda video?

=== Mestizo Latinos and Latinas ===
Mestizo Latina women face racial fetishism much more than their male counterparts. They are seen as something that is tropical. Through media they are portrayed to always be in bright colors, having long brown hair, red lips, curvaceous figure, and revealing clothing. Unlike Latino/Chicano men, Latina/Chicana women have hypersexualized bodies. &amp;nbsp;A perfect example of how Latina women are depicted is [[Jennifer Lopez]]. When she is on a magazine cover or in a photo shoot, her butt is what is emphasized in the picture. Her butt is seemingly abnormal, because it exceeds the standards for a "normal" white butt. This hyper-buttocks places Jennifer Lopez in the category of the other. It is interesting though, because the fact that Latina/Chicanas are in the category of the other, it makes them more desirable. They are perceived as an exotic race that is hypersexual. This tradition excludes Latina/Chicanas from being a part of the norm and they are forever to be viewed as foreigners and a threat to "true" American culture.&lt;ref&gt;Guzmán, Isabel Molina, and Angharad N. Valdivia "Brain, brow, and booty: Latina iconicity in US popular culture."&amp;nbsp;''The communication review''&amp;nbsp;7.2 (2004): 205-221.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to work of George Gerbner, through extended exposure to the very consistent and persistent ideas expressed on television, people tend to view what is being broadcast as a reality with no regard for it veracity. Supposedly the more television someone watches, the more likely they are to see the world in the same lens as the televised world. This means that any ideals in regards to certain races, can influence the way people perceive said races. The way that Latino/a men and women have been portrayed in the media has created a racial fetish on their bodies and culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|pages=347–365|doi=10.1080/15213260701286106|title=The Cultivation of Social Perceptions of Latinos: A Mental Models Approach|journal=Media Psychology|volume=9|issue=2|year=2007|last1=Mastro|first1=Dana|last2=Behm-Morawitz|first2=Elizabeth|last3=Ortiz|first3=Michelle}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Rene Peter Onno Rubiono van Helsdingen''' (born 25 February 1957)&lt;ref name="ALLMUSIC"&gt;{{cite web|last = Helsdingen|first = Rene|url = http://www.renevanhelsdingen.com/biography.html|title = Rene van Helsdingen biography|publisher = |date = |accessdate = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is a Dutch pianist and composer. 

He studied classical music with Komter Loeber in [[Blaricum]] in the Netherlands from 1962–72. Then he studied jazz music with [[Terry Trotter]] and Lazlo Cser in Los Angeles in 1979. His earliest influences include [[Oscar Peterson]], [[McCoy Tyner]] and [[Bill Evans]]. 

Over the years pianist René has recorded and produced for many different labels, such as Virgin, Timeless, WEA, Dureco,  Zebra Acoustic, Pacific Music, Turning Point records, Munich Records, demajors Independent Music Industry Jakarta and his own labels: Relukreul records, and Helsdingen Music, The Netherlands. Helsdingen writes most of his repertoire.  Australian newspaper ''[[The Age]]'' characterised him as "A rewarding pianist who can play comfortably in the groove, or create more impressionistic patterns, or quiet, subtle musings. Perhaps the most notable quality of his solos is brevity. René allows himself a few extended workouts and avoids the trap of repeating himself or overstating his case."&lt;ref&gt;The Age, Melbourne, 23 Dec. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

Helsdingen has organized many successful tours, projects and festivals sponsored by ngo’s , governmental institutions, companies to which he was responsible with regard to the control over the budgets made available.

[[File:The_Horse_in_Motion_high_res.jpg|thumb|right|300px|''Sallie Gardner at a Gallop'' (1878)]]
'''''Sallie Gardner at a Gallop''''',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Sallie Gardner at a Gallop | url=http://www.sfmuseum.org/hist3/sallie.html| work=San Francisco Museum | accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; also known as '''''The Horse in Motion''''', is a series of photographs consisting of a [[Horse#Movement|galloping horse]], the result of a photographic experiment by [[Eadweard Muybridge]] on June 15, 1878.&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;{{cite book | last=Clegg | first=Brian | title=The Man Who Stopped Time| publisher=Joseph Henry Press | year=2007 | isbn=978-0-309-10112-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes cited as an early [[silent film]], the series and later experiments like it were precursors to the development of [[Film|motion pictures]].&lt;ref name="Sanford"&gt;{{cite web | title=Cantor exhibit showcases motion-study photography | author=John Sanford| url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/2003/february12/muybridge-212.html| work=Stanford Report| date=12 February 2003 |accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The series consists of 24 photographs shot in rapid succession that were shown on a [[zoopraxiscope]]. It was released throughout 1878–1880. Muybridge was commissioned by [[Leland Stanford]], the industrialist and horseman, who was interested in gait analysis. The purpose of the shoot was to determine whether a [[Horse gait#Gallop|galloping]] horse ever lifts all four feet completely off the ground during the gait; at this speed, the human eye cannot break down the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=SALLIE GARDNER | url=http://www.filminamerica.com/Movies/SallieGardner/ | work=Film in America | accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photographs showed that all four feet are indeed sometimes simultaneously off the ground, though this occurs only when the feet are "gathered" beneath the body, not when the fore and hindlimbs are "extended" as sometimes depicted in older paintings.

==Development==
[[File:Eadweard Muybridge-Sallie Gardner 1878.jpg|thumb|left|An alternate version of ''Sallie Gardner at a Gallop'' produced from the original negatives (without [[photo manipulation]])]]
Leland Stanford had a large farm at which he bred, trained and raced both [[Standardbred]]s, used for [[harness racing|trotting races]] in which a driver rides in a [[sulky]] while [[driving (horse)|driving]] the horse; and [[Thoroughbreds]], ridden by [[jockey]]s and [[Thoroughbred horse race|raced]] at a gallop. He was interested in improving the performance of his horses of both types and in the scientific questions of their gait action.

During July 1877, the photographer Muybridge tried to settle Stanford's question with a series of progressively clearer, single photographs of Stanford's trotter, Occident, at a racing-speed gait&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Muybridge Meets Occident|journal=Prosper Magazine|author=Sevenson, Richard|date=September 2007|accessdate=2011-01-06|url=http://www.prospermag.com/article/72-41}}&lt;/ref&gt; at the Union Park Racetrack in [[Sacramento]], California.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Sacramento neighborhood considered for historic status|journal=The Sacramento Bee|author=Matt Weiser|date=Aug 2, 2011|accessdate=Dec 2, 2011|url=http://www.sacbee.com/2011/08/02/3810035/sacramento-neighborhood-considered.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2001/mayjun/features/muybridge.html Mitchell Leslie, "The Man Who Stopped Time"], ''Stanford Magazine,'' May–June 2001&lt;/ref&gt;  He captured the horse in a photograph with all four feet off the ground. One of the prints was sent to the local [[California]] [[News media|press]], but because they found that the [[Negative (photography)|film negative]] was retouched, the press dismissed it. As negative retouching was an acceptable and common practice at the time, the photograph won Muybridge an award at the Twelfth San Francisco Industrial Exhibition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=THE COMPLEAT EADWEARD MUYBRIDGE: CHRONOLOGY 1876–1880 (Also in 1878:) | url=http://www.stephenherbert.co.uk/muychron02a.htm| work=Stephen Herbert| accessdate=2010-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lantern slides of the trotting horse photographs survive.&lt;ref name="Freeze"&gt;[http://americanhistory.si.edu/muybridge/htm/htm_sec1/sec1.htm "Capturing the Moment", p. 1], ''Freeze Frame: Eadward Muybridge's Photography of Motion,'' October 7, 2000 – March 15, 2001, National Museum of American History, accessed 9 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

The following year, Stanford financed Muybridge's next project: to use multiple cameras to photograph a Thoroughbred at a gallop at Stanford's farm in [[Palo Alto, California|Palo Alto]] on June 15, 1878, in the presence of the press.&lt;ref name="BC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Muybridge1887"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Muybridge|first1=Eadweard|last2=Mozley|first2=Anita Ventura (foreword)|title=Muybridge's Complete Human and Animal Locomotion: All 781 Plates from the 1887 Animal Locomotion|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2KnuY9AFkG8C&amp;pg=PR17|accessdate=15 June 2012|year=1887|publisher=Courier Dover Publications|isbn=9780486237923|page=xvii}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muybridge photographed the businessman's [[Kentucky]]-bred mare named Sallie Gardner running.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Eadweard Muybridge: Jumping a hurdle; saddle; bay horse Daisy | url=http://www.worcesterart.org/Collection/American/1973.163.html | work=Worcester Art Museum | accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Static Instructional Graphics | url=http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/ci/vl/vl1/Jose%20paper.pdf | work=Inter-disciplinary.ne| accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=The horse in motion, illus. by Muybridge.

He had arranged the cameras along a track parallel to the horse's path. Muybridge used 24 cameras&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Eadweard J.

The [[Shutter (photography)|shutters]] were controlled by trip wires triggered by the horse's legs. The photographs were taken in succession one twenty-fifth of a second apart, with the [[shutter speed]]s calculated to be less than 1/2000 s. The jockey Domm set the mare to travel at a speed of 1:40, which meant that she was galloping at a mile per 1 minute and 40 seconds, equivalent to {{convert|36|mph}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lectures on Painting | page=176 |first=Edward |last=Armitage|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|isbn=978-1-4437-6991-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Thematic Divisions of Images | url=http://facstaff.unca.edu/vspivey/S06ARTH202/S06202studyguide.pdf | work=UNCA| accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The stop-action photographs showed the mare lifted all four legs off the ground at certain points during the gallop. Run together, the photographs produced the effect of the horse in motion, or a film. Muybridge produced his prints onsite; when the press noticed the broken straps on Sallie's saddle in the prints, they became convinced of the prints' authenticity. ''[[Scientific American]]'' was among the publications that carried reports of Muybridge's groundbreaking 1878 work.&lt;ref name="Freeze" /&gt; While there have been rumors that Stanford had a large bet riding on the outcome of the study, the historian Phillip Prodger has said, "I personally believe that the story of the bet is apocryphal. There are really no primary accounts of this bet ever having taken place. Everything is hearsay and secondhand information."&lt;ref name="Sanford" /&gt;

==Aftermath==

In 1880, Muybridge first projected moving images on a screen when he gave a presentation at the California School of Fine Arts;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Eadward Muybridge (1830–1904) | url=http://www.iphf.org/Hall_Of_Fame/Inducties_Bios/Eadweard_Muybridge_Bio.html| work=International Photography Hall of Fame | accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; this was the earliest known motion picture exhibition. He later met with [[Thomas Edison]], who had recently invented the [[phonograph]]. Edison went on to invent the [[kinetoscope]], the precursor of the [[movie camera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Chapter 11 | url=http://www.precinemahistory.net/1870.htm | work=Precinema History | accessdate=2010-02-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The relationship between Muybridge and Stanford became turbulent in 1882.  Stanford commissioned the book ''The Horse in Motion: as Shown by Instantaneous Photography'', written by his friend and horseman J. D. B. Stillman; it was published by Osgood and Company.&lt;ref name="Freeze" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Mitchell"&gt;{{cite web | title=The Man Who Stopped Time | last=Leslie |first =Mitchell| url=http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2001/mayjun/features/muybridge.html| work=Stanford Alumni Magazine | accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book claimed to feature instantaneous photography, but showed 100 illustrations based on Muybridge's photographs taken of Stanford's mare Sallie.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Still J.D.B. | url=https://www.biodiversitylibrary.org/bibliography/20651| work=Biodiversity Heritage Library | accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muybridge was not credited in the book except noted as a Stanford employee and in a [[Index (publishing)|technical appendix]] based on an account he had written. As a result, the [[Royal Society for the encouragement of Arts, Manufactures &amp; Commerce|Britain's Royal Society of Arts]], which earlier had offered to finance further photographic studies by Muybridge of animal movement, withdrew the funding.  His suit against Stanford to gain credit was dismissed out of court.&lt;ref name="Mitchell" /&gt;

Muybridge soon gained support for two years of studies under the auspices of the [[University of Pennsylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Prestige, Professionalism, and the Paradox of Eadweard Muybridge's Animal Locomotion Nudes | last=Gordon |first=|url=http://www.historycooperative.org/cgi-bin/justtop.cgi?act=justtop&amp;url=http://www.historycooperative.org/journals/pmh/130.1/gordon.html | work=Pennsylvania Museum of History and Biography|year=2010 |accessdate=2010-02-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; The university published his current and previous work as an extensive portfolio of 780 [[Collotype|collotype plates]], under the title ''Animal Locomotion: An Electro-photographic Investigation of Consecutive Phases of Animal Movements,'' 1872–1885. The collotype plates measured 19 by 24&amp;nbsp;inches, each were contained in 36 by 36-inch frames; the total number of images were approximately 20,000. The published plates included 514 of men and women in motion, 27 plates of abnormal male and female movement, 16 of children, 5 plates of adult male hand movement, and 221 with animal subjects.

The "Sallie Gardner" experiment was the subject of a [[Google Doodle|Google doodle]] on April 9, 2012 (on the 182nd anniversary of Muybridge's birthday).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Eadweard J.

'''San Giovanni in Tuba''' is a church in [[San Giovanni di Duino]], a hamlet which forms part of the [[comune|commune]] of [[Duino]] in the [[Province of Trieste]], north-east [[Italy]]. It is located at the [[Spring (hydrosphere)|resurgence]]  of the [[Timavo]] and is notable for the remains of a palaeo-Christian [[basilica]].

There are remains indicating that in the beginning it was a pagan temple dedicated to god [[Diomedes]], Temavus, [[Hercules]] and [[Saturn (mythology)|Saturn]].
In 568 with the arrival of the [[Lombards]] in 610, or with the invasion of the [[Pannonian Avars|Avars]], the relics that had been laid under the altar was hidden in another place. The invasion of the [[Hungarians]] completely destroyed the [[Benedictine]] Monastery.

In 1112 the patriarch Vodolrico ordered the reconstruction work of the church. In mid-1400 the Walsee Duino, feudal lords of the [[Timavo]] resurgences and its port, added a Gothic [[apse]]. Further damage to the structure of the church were caused in the 15th and 16th centuries by the Turks, and a restoration was undertaken in 1519 by Giovanni Hoffer, Captain of [[Duino]] in 1642, when the bell tower was built in Venetian style.

The church of San Giovanni in Tuba was heavily damaged in 1917 during the [[World War I]]. The frescoes were almost all lost. What was saved is the floor of the ancient Christian basilica, a polychrome mosaic with geometric motifs including [[Solomon’s knot]]s, and floral designs. 

Today, mass is not celebrated in the Church.

[[File:Adventures of captain marvel.jpg|thumb|right|DVD front cover for ''[[Adventures of Captain Marvel|The Adventures of Captain Marvel]]'', one of the most celebrated serials for both Republic Pictures and of the sound era in general.]]

A '''serial,''' '''film serial''', '''movie serial''' or '''chapter play,''' is a motion picture form popular during the first half of the 20th century, consisting of a series of [[short subject]]s exhibited in consecutive order at one theater, generally advancing weekly, until the series is completed.  Generally, each serial involves a single set of characters, protagonistic and antagonistic, involved in a single story, which has been edited into chapters after the fashion of [[Serial (literature)|serial fiction]] and the episodes cannot be shown out of order or as a single or a random collection of short subjects.  

Each chapter was screened at a movie theater for one week, and ended with a ''[[cliffhanger]],'' in which characters found themselves in perilous situations with little apparent chance of escape. Viewers had to return each week to see the cliffhangers resolved  and to follow the continuing story. Movie serials were especially popular with children, and for many youths in the first half of the 20th century a typical Saturday [[:wikt:matinee|matinee]] at the movies included at least one chapter of a serial, along with [[animated cartoon]]s, [[newsreel]]s, and two [[feature film]]s.

==Popularity and decline==
Many serials were [[Western (genre)|Westerns]], since those were the least expensive to film. Besides Westerns, though, there were films covering many genres, including [[crime fiction]], [[espionage]], [[comic book]] or [[comic strip]] characters, [[science fiction]], and jungle adventures. Although most serials were filmed economically, some were made at significant expense. The ''[[Flash Gordon (serial)|Flash Gordon]]'' serial and its sequels, for instance, were major productions in their times.

Serials were a popular form of movie entertainment dating back to Edison's ''[[What Happened to Mary]]'' of 1912. There appear to be older serials, however, such as the 1910 Deutsche Vitaskop 5 episode ''[[Arsène Lupin contra Sherlock Holmes|Arsene Lupin Contra Sherlock Holmes]]'', based upon the Maurice LeBlanc novel,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/A/ArseneLupinContraSherl1910.html|title=Silent Era : Progressive Silent Film List|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a possible but unconfirmed ''Raffles'' serial in 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.silentera.com/PSFL/data/R/Raffles1911.html|title=Silent Era : Progressive Silent Film List|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually filmed with low budgets, serials were action-packed stories that usually involved a [[hero]] (or heroes) battling an evil [[villain]] and rescuing [[damsel in distress]]. The villain would continually place the hero into inescapable deathtraps, or the heroine would be placed into a deathtrap and the hero would bravely come to her rescue, usually pulling her away from certain death only moments before she met her doom. The hero and heroine would face one trap after another, battling countless thugs and lackeys, before finally defeating the villain.

Many famous clichés of action-adventure movies had their origins in the serials. The popular term [[cliffhanger]] was developed as a [[plot device]] in film serials (though its origins have been traced by some historians to the [[Sherlock Holmes]] stories of [[Arthur Conan Doyle]] or the earlier ''[[A Pair of Blue Eyes]]'' by [[Thomas Hardy]] from 1873), and it comes from the many times that the hero or heroine would end up hanging over a cliff, usually as the villain gloated above and waited for them to plummet hundreds of metres to their deaths. Other popular clichés included the heroine or hero trapped in a burning building, being trampled by horses, knocked unconscious in a car as it goes over a cliff, crashing in an airplane, and watching as the burning fuse of a nearby bundle of dynamite sparked and sputtered its way towards the deadly explosive (at the beginning of the next chapter the endangered character usually simply got up and walked away with only minor scrapes). The popular [[Indiana Jones]] movies are a well-known, romantic [[pastiche]] of the serials' clichéd plot elements and devices.

The silent era was the zenith of the movie serial and serial stars from this period were major stars such as [[Pearl White]], who starred in the quintessential silent serial ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|The Perils of Pauline]],'' which still ranks among the best known silent films. [[Ruth Roland]], [[Marin Sais]], [[Ann Little]], and [[Helen Holmes]] were also early leading serial queens. Most of these serials put beautiful young women in jeopardy week after week. The serials starring women were the most popular during the silent period but in the sound era few serials had a female character in the major role.
Years after their first release, serials gained new life at "Saturday Matinees", theatrical showings on Saturday mornings aimed directly at children. For that reason, serials are sometimes called "Saturday Matinee Serials", even though they were originally shown with feature films.

In the early days of [[Serial (radio and television)|television]] in the United States, movie serials were often broadcast, one chapter a day, and in the late 1970s and 1980s, they were often revived on [[BBC]] television in the United Kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://genome.ch.bbc.co.uk/search/0/20?adv=0&amp;q=Undersea+Kingdom&amp;media=all&amp;yf=1923&amp;yt=2009&amp;mf=1&amp;mt=12&amp;tf=00:00&amp;tt=00:00#search|title=Search Results - BBC Genome|website=genome.ch.bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many have been released in [[home video]] formats.

==Usual terms==
Besides the hero or heroine, some terms are used to define villains and supporting players:

* The ''saddle pal'' or ''[[sidekick]]'' was the helper or assistant of the hero or heroine. That person was often a bumbling comic relief.
* The ''brains heavy'' was the man (or, on occasion, woman) who issued the orders to his ''[[Henchman#In popular culture|henchmen]]''. He often wears a suit, and pretends to be an upright, lawful member of the community. He usually had little to do until the last chapter except talk, snarl, or grimace.
* The ''action heavy'' is the assistant or second-in-command to the brains heavy who usually wore workmanlike duds, did the physical labor, and often had more brawn than brains. He went from one chapter to the next trying desperately to kill the hero with fists, knives, guns, bombs, or whatever else was handy at the time.
* The ''oldtimer'' was the man who (a) owned the ranch, (b)  the father of the hero (or heroine) and often had a short film lifespan, as well (c) those that wore a badge of a sheriff, marshall, or ranger.
* The ''middle-aged'' and ''older'' performers who were judges, lawyers, storeowners, wardens, owners of the local newspaper, scientists, executives, or professors.

===Silent era===
Famous American serials of the silent era include ''[[The Perils of Pauline (1914 serial)|The Perils of Pauline]]'' and ''[[The Exploits of Elaine]]'' made by [[Pathé Frères]] and starring [[Pearl White]]. Another popular serial was the 119-episode ''[[The Hazards of Helen]]'' made by [[Kalem Studios]] and starring [[Helen Holmes]] for the first forty-eight episodes then [[Helen Gibson]] for the remainder. Other major studios of the silent era, such as [[Vitagraph]] and [[Essanay Studios]], produced serials, as did [[Warner Bros.]], [[20th Century Fox|Fox]], and [[Universal Studios|Universal]]. Several independent companies (for example, [[Mascot Pictures]]) made [[Western (genre)|Western]] serials. Four silent [[Tarzan]] serials were also made.

Europe had its own serials: in France [[Victorin-Hippolyte Jasset]] launched his series of [[Nick Carter, le roi des détectives|Nick Carter]] films in 1908, and the idea of the episodic crime adventure was developed particularly by [[Louis Feuillade]] in ''[[Fantômas (1913 serial)|Fantômas]]'' (1913–14), ''[[Les Vampires]]'' (1915), and ''[[Judex (1916 film)|Judex]]'' (1916); in Germany,  ''[[Homunculus (film)|Homunculus]]'' (1916), directed by [[Otto Rippert]], was a six-part horror serial about an artificial creature.

===Sound era===
The arrival of sound technology made it costlier to produce serials, so that they were no longer as profitable on a flat rental basis. Further, the [[Great Depression]] made it impossible for many of the smaller companies that produced serials to upgrade to sound, and they went out of business. Only one serial specialty company, [[Mascot Pictures]], transitioned from silent to sound filmmaking. [[Universal Pictures]] also kept its serial unit alive through the transition.

In the early 1930s a handful of independent companies tried their hand at making serials, but managed only two or three, including the once-prolific Weiss Brothers. The Weisses bought a little time when [[Columbia Pictures]] decided to take a try at serials, and contracted with them (as Adventure Serials Inc.) to make three chapterplays. They were successful enough that Columbia then established its own serial unit and the Weisses essentially disappeared from the serial scene. This was in 1937, and Columbia was probably inspired by the previous year's serial blockbuster success at Universal, ''[[Flash Gordon (serial)|Flash Gordon]]'', the first serial ever to play at a major theater on [[Broadway (Manhattan)|Broadway]]; and by the success of that same year of the newly created [[Republic Pictures]], which dedicated itself to a program of serials and westerns, eschewing major productions in their favor. The creation of Republic involved the absorption of [[Mascot Pictures]], so that by 1937, serial production was now in the hands of three companies only - Universal, Columbia, and Republic, with Republic quickly becoming the acknowledged leader in quality serial product. Each company turned out four to five serials per year, of 12 to 15 episodes each, a pace they all kept up until the end of [[World War II]] when, in 1946, Universal dropped its serial unit along with its B-picture unit and renamed its production department Universal-International Pictures. Republic and Columbia continued unchallenged, with about four serials per year each, Republic fixing theirs at 12 chapters each while Columbia fixed at fifteen.

By the mid-1950s, however, episodic [[television]] series and the sale of older serials to TV syndicators by all the current and past major sound serial producers, together with the loss of audience attendance at Saturday matinees in general, made serial-making a losing proposition.

===Post-1950s serials===
There have been several post-1950s attempts at reviving or recalling cliffhanger serials, by both fans and professional studios, and serials were often spoofed in cartoons of the 1960s.

====Amateur/fan efforts====

An early attempt at a low-budget Western serial, filmed in color, was entitled ''The Silver Avenger.'' One or two chapters exist of this effort on 16mm film but it is not known whether the serial was ever completed.

The best-known fan-made chapter play is the four-chapter, silent 16mm amateur effort made to resemble Republic and Columbia serials of the 1940s  ''Captain Celluloid vs. the Film Pirates,'' completed in 1966. The plot involved a masked villain named The Master Duper, one of three members of a Film Commission who attempts to acquire the only known prints of various lost nitrate films, and the heroic Captain Celluloid, who wears a costume reminiscent of that of the Black Commando in Columbia Pictures' serial ''The Secret Code,'' is determined to uncover him. Roles in the serial are played by, among others, film historians and serial fans [[Alan Barbour]] and [[William K. Everson]].

In the 1970s, serial fan Blackie Seymour shot a complete 15-chapter serial called ''The Return of the Copperhead.''  Mr. Seymour's only daughter, who operated the camera at the age of 8, attests that as of 2008 the serial was indeed filmed but the raw footage remains in cans, unedited...  "perhaps someday" to be assembled.

In 2001, ''King of the Park Rangers,'' a 1-chapter sound serial was released by Cliffhanger Productions on VHS video tape in sepia. It concerned the adventures of a Park Ranger named Patricia King and an FBI Agent who  track down a trio of killers out to find buried treasure in the New Jersey Pine Barrens.

A second 10-chapter serial, ''The Dangers of Deborah,'' in which a female reporter and a criminologist fight to uncover the identity of a mysterious villain named The Terror, was released by Cliffhanger Productions in 2008.

In 2006, Lamb4 Productions created its own homage to the film serials of the 1940s with its own serial titled "Wildcat."  The story revolves around a super hero named Wildcat and his attempts to save the fictional Rite City from a masked villain known as the Roach.  This 8-chapter serial was based heavily on popular super hero serials such as "Batman and Robin," "Captain America," and "The Adventures of Captain Marvel."  After its premiere, "Wildcat" was posted on the official Lamb4 Productions YouTube channel for public viewing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://geocities.com/wildcatmovie/&amp;date=2009-10-25+03:54:11  "Wildcat" Movie Serial Official Site]&lt;/ref&gt;

====Studio/commercial efforts, cartoons, and spoofery====

The serial format was used with stories on the original run of ''[[The Mickey Mouse Club]]'' (1955–58), with each chapter running about six to ten minutes.  The longer-running dramatic serials included "Corky and White Shadow", "The Adventures of [[Spin and Marty]]", "[[The Hardy Boys]]: The Mystery of the Applegate Treasure", "The Boys of the Western Sea", "The Secret of Mystery Lake", "The Hardy Boys: The Mystery of Ghost Farm", and ''[[The Adventures of Clint and Mac]]''.

Other Disney programs shown on ''[[Walt Disney Presents]]'' in segments (such as ''[[The Scarecrow of Romney Marsh]]'', ''[[The Swamp Fox (TV series)|The Swamp Fox]]'', ''The Secret of Boyne Castle'', ''The Mooncussers'', and ''[[The Prince and the Pauper#Film, TV, theatrical, and other adaptations|The Prince and the Pauper]]'') and Disney feature films (including ''[[Treasure Island (1950 film)|Treasure Island]]''; ''[[The Three Lives of Thomasina]]''; ''[[The Story of Robin Hood and His Merrie Men]]''; ''[[Rob Roy, the Highland Rogue]]''; and ''[[The Fighting Prince of Donegal]]'') edited into segments for television presentation often had a cliffhanger-serial-like feel. {{Why?|date=March 2011}}

In England, in the 1950s and 60s, low-budget 6-chapter serials such as ''Dusty Bates'' and ''Masters of Venus'' were released theatrically, but these were not particularly well-regarded or remembered.

Of course, perhaps the greatest number of serialized television programs to feature any single character were those made featuring ''[[Doctor Who]]'', the BBC character introduced in 1963. ''Doctor Who'' serials would run anywhere from 3 to 12 episodes and were shown in weekly segments as had been the original theatrical cliffhangers. ''Doctor Who'' was syndicated in the US as early as 1974 but did not gain a following in America until the mid-1980s when episodes featuring Tom Baker reached its shores.

The 1960s cartoon show ''[[The Rocky and Bullwinkle Show|Adventures of Rocky and Bullwinkle]]'' included two serial-style episodes per program. These spoofed the cliffhanger serial form. Within the Rocky and Bullwinke show, the recurring but non-serialized ''[[Dudley Do-Right]]'', specifically parodied the damsel in distress (Nell Fenwick) being tied to railroad tracks by arch villain [[Snidely Whiplash]] and rescued by the noble but clueless Dudley. The [[Hanna–Barbera]] ''[[The Perils of Penelope Pitstop|Perils of Penelope Pitstop]]'' was a takeoff on the silent serials ''The Perils of Pauline'' and ''The Iron Claw,'' which featured [[Paul Lynde]] as the voice of the villain Sylvester Sneakley, alias "The Hooded Claw".

''[[Danger Island (TV series)|Danger Island]],'' a multi-part story in under-10-minute episodes, was shown on the Saturday morning [[The Banana Splits|Banana Splits]] program in the late 1960s. Episodes were short, full of wild action and usually ended on a cliffhanger. This serial is notable for having been directed by [[Richard Donner]] and featuring the first African American action hero in a chapter play. The violence present in most of the episodes, though much of it was deliberately comical and would not be considered shocking today, also raised concerns at a time when violence in children's TV was at issue.

On February 27, 1979, [[NBC]] broadcast the first episode of an hour-long weekly television series ''[[Cliffhangers (TV series)|Cliffhangers!]]'', which had three segments, each with a different serial: a horror story (''The Curse of Dracula'', starring [[Michael Nouri]]), a science fiction/western (''The Secret Empire,'' (inspired by 1935's ''The Phantom Empire'') starring Geoffrey Scott as Marshal Jim Donner and [[Mark Lenard]] as Emperor Thorval) and a mystery (''Stop Susan Williams!'', starring [[Susan Anton]], [[Ray Walston]] as Bob Richards, and [[Albert Paulsen]] as the villain Anthony Korf). Unfortunately, though final episodes were shot, the series was canceled and the last program aired on May 1, 1979 before all of the serials could conclude; only ''The Curse of Dracula'' was resolved.

In 2006, Dark Horse Indie films, through Image Entertainment, released a 6-chapter serial parody called ''Monarch of the Moon,'' detailing the adventures of a hero named the Yellow Jacket, who could control Yellow Jackets with his voice, battled "Japbots", and traveled to the moon. The end credits promised a second serial, ''Commie Commandos From Mars.'' Dark Horse attempted to promote the release as a just-found, never-before-released serial made in 1946, but suppressed by the US Government.

==Production==

===Peak form===
The classic sound serial, particularly in its [[republic Pictures|Republic]] format, has a first episode of about 30 minutes (approximately three [[reel]]s in length) and begins with reports of a [[Masked Mystery Villain|masked, secret, or unsuspected villain]] menacing an unspecific part of America. This episode traditionally has the most detailed credits at the beginning, often with pictures of the actors with their names and that of the character they play. Often there follows a montage of scenes lifted from the cliffhangers of previous serials to depict the ways in which the master criminal was a serial killer with a motive. In the first episode, various suspects or "candidates" who may, in secret, be this villain are presented, and the viewer often hears the voice but does not see the face of this mastermind commanding his "lead villain", similar to a sergeant, whom the viewer sees in just about every episode.

In the succeeding weeks (usually 11 to 14) thereafter, an episode nearly 20 minutes (approximately two [[reel]]s) in length was presented, in which the "lead villain" and lesser thugs commit crimes in various places, fight the hero, and trap someone to make the ending a cliffhanger. Many of the episodes have clues, dialogue, and events leading the viewer to think that any of the candidates were the mastermind. As serials were made by writing the whole script first and then slicing it into portions filmed at various sites, often the same location would be used several times in the serial, often given different signage, or none at all, just being referred to differently. There would often be a female love interest of the male hero, or a female hero herself, but as the audience was mainly children, there was no hugging and kissing.

In 1938, Republic introduced the "economy episode" (or "recap chapter") in which the characters  summarize or reminisce about their adventures, so as to introduce showing those scenes again (in the manner of a [[clip show]] in modern television). This type of episode usually had a cheap, mechanical cliffhanger, like a time bomb rather than being unconscious in a runaway vehicle.

The beginning of each chapter would bring the story up to date by repeating the last few minutes of the previous chapter, and then revealing how the main character escaped. Often the reprised scene would add an element not seen in the previous close, but unless it contradicted something shown previously, audiences accepted the explanation. On rare occasions the filmmakers would depend on the audience not remembering details of the previous week's chapter, using alternate outcomes that did not exactly match the previous episode's cliffhanger.

The last episode was sometimes a bit longer than most, for its tasks were to unmask the head villain (who usually was someone completely unsuspected), wrap up the loose ends, and end with a triumphal proclamation, followed by a joke – and sometimes a kiss (provided that the story supplied a heroine to receive it).

===Production practices===

The major studios had their own retinues of actors and writers, their own prop departments, existing sets, stock footage, and music libraries. The early independent studios had none of these, except for being able to rent the sets of independent producers of western features.

The firms saved money by reusing the same cliffhangers, stunt and special effect sequences over the years. Mines or tunnels flooded often, even in ''[[Flash Gordon (serial)|Flash Gordon]]'', and the same model cars and trains went off the same cliffs and bridges. Republic had a [[Packard]] limousine and a [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] [[Woodie (car body style)|Woodie]] station wagon used in serial after serial so they could match the shots with the stock footage from the model or previous stunt driving. Three different serials had them chasing the [[Art Deco]] sound truck, required for location shooting, for various reasons. Male fistfighters all wore hats so that the change from actor to [[stunt double]] would not be caught so easily. A rubber liner on the hatband of the stuntman's fedora would make a seal on the stuntman's head, so the hat would stay on during fight scenes.

Exposition of what led up to the previous episode's cliffhanger was usually displayed on placards with a photograph of one of the characters on it. In 1938, Universal brought the first "scrolling text" exposition to the serial, which [[George Lucas]] first used in ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]'' in 1977 and then in all of the following ''[[Star Wars]]'' films. As this would have required subcontracting the optical effects, Republic saved money by not using it.

===Stylistic differences between the studios===

'''[[Universal Studios|Universal]]''' had been making serials since the 1910s, and continued to service its loyal neighborhood-theater customers with four serials annually. The studio made news in 1929 by hiring [[Tim McCoy]] to star in its first all-talking serial, ''The Indians Are Coming!'' Epic footage from this western serial turned up again and again in later serials and features. In 1936 Universal scored a coup by licensing the popular comic-strip character  [[Flash Gordon]] for the screen; the serial was a smash hit, and was even booked into first-run theaters that usually did not bother with chapter plays. Universal followed it up with more pop-culture icons: [[Green Hornet|The Green Hornet]] and [[Ace Drummond]] from radio, and [[The Adventures of Smilin' Jack|Smilin' Jack]] and [[Buck Rogers]] from newspapers. Universal was more story-conscious than the other studios, and cast its serials with "name" actors recognizable from feature films: [[Lon Chaney, Jr.]], [[Béla Lugosi]], [[Dick Foran]], [[The Dead End Kids]], [[Kent Taylor]], [[Robert Armstrong (actor)|Robert Armstrong]], [[Irene Hervey]], and [[Johnny Mack Brown]], among many others. In the 1940s Universal's serials employed urban and/or wartime themes, incorporating newsreel footage of actual disasters. The 1942 serial ''[[Gang Busters (serial)|Gang Busters]]'' is perhaps the best of Universal's urban serials; Universal often cannibalized it for future cliffhangers. [[Don Winslow of the Navy]] may exemplify Universal's best war-themed chapterplay. The studio's reliance on stock footage for the big action scenes was certainly economical, but it often hurt the overall quality of the films. When the studio reorganized as Universal-International, it shut down most of the production units, including the serial crew. Universal's last serial was ''[[The Mysterious Mr. M]]'' (1946).

'''[[Republic Pictures|Republic]]''' was the successor to [[Mascot Pictures]], a serial specialist. Writers and directors were already geared to staging exciting films, and Republic improved on Mascot, adding music to underscore the action, and staging more elaborate stunts. Republic was one of Hollywood's smaller studios, but its serials have been hailed as some of the best, especially those directed by [[John English (director)|John English]] and [[William Witney]]. In addition to solid [[screenwriting]] that many critics thought was quite accomplished, the firm also introduced choreographed fistfights, which often included the stuntmen (usually the ones portraying the villains, never the heroes) throwing things in desperation at one another in every fight to heighten the action. Republic serials are noted for outstanding special effects, such as large-scale explosions and demolitions, and the more fantastic visuals like [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]] and [[King of the Rocket Men|Rocketman]] flying. Most of the trick scenes were engineered by [[Lydecker brothers|Howard and Theodore Lydecker]]. Republic was able to get the rights to the newspaper comic character [[Dick Tracy]], the radio character [[Lone Ranger|The Lone Ranger]], and the comic book characters [[Captain America]], [[Captain Marvel (DC Comics)|Captain Marvel]], and [[Spy Smasher]]. Republic's serial scripts were written by a team of up to seven writers. By 1950 Republic had amassed an impressive backlog of action highlights, which were cleverly re-edited into later serials to save money. Most of the studio's serials of the 1950s were written by only one man, [[Ronald Davidson]]—Davidson had produced many serials. Republic's last serial was ''[[King of the Carnival]]'' (1955), a reworking of 1939's ''[[Daredevils of the Red Circle]]'' using some of its footage.

'''[[Columbia Pictures|Columbia]]''' made several serials using its own staff and facilities (1938–1939 and 1943–1945), but usually subcontracted its serial production to outside producers: the [[Louis Weiss (producer)|Weiss Brothers]] (1937–1938), [[Larry Darmour]] (1939–1942), and [[Sam Katzman]] (1945–1956). Columbia built many serials around name-brand heroes. From newspaper comics, they got [[Terry and the Pirates (serial)|Terry and the Pirates]], [[Mandrake the Magician]], [[The Phantom]], and [[Brenda Starr, Reporter]]; from the comic books, [[Blackhawk (DC Comics)|Blackhawk]], [[Congo Bill]], time traveler [[Brick Bradford]], and [[Batman]] and [[Superman]] (although this last owed more to [[The Adventures of Superman (radio)|its radio incarnation]], which the credits acknowledged); from radio, [[Jack Armstrong, the All-American Boy|Jack Armstrong]] and [[Hop Harrigan]]; from the pulp novels the Spider and [[The Shadow]] (despite also being a very popular radio series); from the British novelist [[Edgar Wallace]], the first archer-superhero, The Green Archer; and even from television: [[Captain Video]]. Columbia's early serials were very well received by audiences—exhibitors voted ''[[The Spider's Web]]'' (1938) the number-one serial of the year. Former silent-serial director [[James W. Horne]] co-directed ''The Spider's Web'', and his work secured him a permanent position in Columbia's serial unit. Horne had been a comedy specialist in the 1930s, often working with [[Laurel and Hardy]], and most of his Columbia serials are played tongue-in-cheek, with exaggerated villainy and improbable heroics (the hero takes on six men in a fistfight and ''wins''). After Horne's death in 1942, the studio's serial output was somewhat more sober, but still aimed primarily at the juvenile audience. ''[[Batman (serial)|Batman]]'' (1943) was quite popular, and ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'' (1948) was phenomenally successful. [[Spencer Gordon Bennet]], another silent-serial veteran, directed most of the later Columbia serials. His western-themed efforts were suitably accomplished, but Columbia cut corners in every respect until the quality of the serials suffered. Columbia also used cartoon animation instead of more expensive special effects with its science-fictional serials. By the 1950s Columbia serials were low-budget affairs, consisting mostly of action scenes and cliffhanger endings from older productions, and even employing the same actors for new scenes tying the old footage together. Columbia outlasted the other serial producers, its last being ''[[Blazing the Overland Trail]]'' (1956).

==Availability==
Film serials released to the home video market from original masters include the majority of Republic titles (with a few exceptions, such as ''[[Ghost of Zorro]]'')—which were released by Republic Pictures Home Video on VHS and sometimes laserdisc (sometimes under their re-release titles) mostly from transfers made from the original negatives, ''[[The Shadow (serial)|The Shadow]]'', and ''[[Blackhawk (serial)|Blackhawk]]'', both released by Sony only on VHS, and DVD versions of ''[[Flash Gordon (serial)|Flash Gordon]]'', ''[[Flash Gordon's Trip to Mars]]'', and ''[[Flash Gordon Conquers the Universe]]'' (Hearst), ''[[Adventures of Captain Marvel]]'' (Republic Pictures), ''[[Batman (serial)|Batman]]'' and ''[[Batman and Robin (serial)|Batman and Robin]]'' (Sony), ''[[Superman (serial)|Superman]]'' and ''[[Atom Man vs. Superman]]'' (Warner), and ''[[The Green Hornet (serial)|The Green Hornet]]'' (VCI). Notable restorations of partially lost or forgotten serials such as ''[[The Adventures of Tarzan]]'', ''[[Beatrice Fairfax]]'', ''[[The Lone Ranger Rides Again]]'', ''[[Daredevils of the West]]'' and ''[[King of the Mounties]]'' have been developed and made available to fans by The Serial Squadron. A gray market for DVDs also exists consisting of DVD companies releasing titles from privately owned 16mm prints or even copies of previously released VHS or laserdisc editions, and various websites and internet auctions. These DVDs vary between good and poor quality, depending on their source. In 2017, Adventures of Captain Marvel became the first serial to be released on Blu-Ray.

[[File:Eugen de Blaas The Flirtation.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''The Flirtation'' (1904), by [[Eugene de Blaas]]]]
'''Sexual attraction''' is [[Attractiveness|attraction]] on the basis of [[sexual desire]] or the quality of arousing such interest.&lt;ref name="Sexual attraction"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual attraction| publisher=[[TheFreeDictionary.com]]|accessdate=December 16, 2011|url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/sexual+attraction}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sexual attraction2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Sexual attraction| publisher=[[Reference.com]]|accessdate=December 16, 2011|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/sexual+attraction}}&lt;/ref&gt; '''Sexual attractiveness''' or '''sex appeal''' is an individual's ability to attract the [[Human sexuality|sexual]] or [[erotic]] interests of other people, and is a factor in [[sexual selection]] or [[mate choice]]. The attraction can be to the [[physical attraction|physical]] or other qualities or traits of a person, or to such qualities in the context where they appear. The attraction may be to a person's [[aesthetics]] or movements or to their voice or smell, besides other factors. The attraction may be enhanced by a person's adornments, clothing, perfume or [[hair style|style]]. It can be influenced by [[individual]] [[Genetics|genetic]], [[psychological]], or cultural factors, or to other, more amorphous qualities. Sexual attraction is also a response to another person that depends on a combination of the person possessing the traits and on the criteria of the person who is attracted.

Though attempts have been made to devise objective criteria of sexual attractiveness and measure it as [[individual capital|one of several bodily forms of]] [[capital asset]] (''see [[erotic capital]]''), a person's sexual attractiveness is to a large extent a subjective measure dependent on another person's interest, perception, and [[sexual orientation]]. For example, a [[Homosexuality|gay or lesbian person]] would typically find a person of the [[Same-sex attraction|same sex]] to be more attractive than one of the other sex. A [[bisexuality|bisexual person]] would find either sex to be attractive. [[Asexuality]] refers to those who do not experience sexual attraction for either sex, though they may have romantic attraction (homoromantic, biromantic or heteroromantic) or a non-directed libido.&lt;ref name=asexualityarchive&gt;{{cite web|title=Things That Are Not Asexuality|url=http://www.asexualityarchive.com/things-that-are-not-asexuality/|website=Asexuality Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Interpersonal attraction]] includes factors such as [[propinquity|physical or psychological similarity]], [[Intimate relationship#Intimacy|familiarity]] or possessing a preponderance of [[Koinophilia#Physical attractiveness|common or familiar features]], [[similarity (psychology)|similarity]], [[Interpersonal compatibility|complementarity]], [[reciprocal liking]], and [[reinforcement]].&lt;ref&gt;Miller, R., Perlman, D., and Brehm, S.S. Intimate Relationships, 4th Edition, McGrawHill Companies.{{page needed|date=December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ability of a person's physical and other qualities to create a sexual interest in others is the basis of their use in [[sex in advertising|advertising]], [[Sex in film|film]], and other visual media, as well as in [[Model (person)|modeling]] and other occupations.

In evolutionary terms, the [[ovulatory shift hypothesis]] posits that female humans exhibit different sexual behaviours and desires at points in their [[menstrual cycle]], as a means to ensure that they attract a high quality mate to copulate with during their most [[Fertile window|fertile]] time. Hormone levels throughout the menstrual cycle affect a woman's overt behaviours, influencing the way a woman presents herself to others during stages of her menstrual cycle, in attempt to attract high quality mates the closer the woman is to [[ovulation]].&lt;ref name="Pillsworth"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pillsworth|first1=Elizabeth G.|last2=Haselton|first2=Martie G.|last3=Buss|first3=David M.|title=Ovulatory Shifts in Female Sexual Desire|journal=Journal of Sex Research|date=February 2004|volume=41|issue=1|pages=55–65|doi=10.1080/00224490409552213|pmid=15216424|url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/papers/downloads/ovulatoryshifts.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Social and biological factors==
[[Human sexuality]] has many aspects. In [[biology]], sexuality describes the reproductive mechanism and the basic biological drive that exists in all sexually reproducing species and can encompass [[sexual intercourse]] and sexual contact in all its forms. There are also emotional and physical aspects of sexuality. These relate to the bond between individuals, which may be expressed through profound feelings or emotions. [[Sociology|Sociologically]], it can cover the [[Culture|cultural]], [[Politics|political]], and [[Law|legal]] aspects; [[philosophy|philosophically]], it can span the [[morality|moral]], [[ethics|ethical]], [[theology|theological]], [[spirituality|spiritual]], and [[religion|religious]] aspects.

Which aspects of a person's sexuality attract another is influenced by [[cultural]] factors; it has varied over time as well as personal factors. Influencing factors may be determined more locally among sub-cultures, across [[sexual field]]s, or simply by the preferences of the [[individual]]. These preferences come about as a result of a complex variety of [[Genetics|genetic]], [[psychological]], and cultural factors.

A person's [[physical appearance]] has a critical impact on their sexual attractiveness. This involves the impact one's appearance has on the [[sense]]s, especially in the beginning of a relationship:

* [[Visual perception]] (the symmetry of [[Facial symmetry|the face]], [[physical attractiveness]], [[Human skin|health]], and how they act or move, for example, while dancing);
* [[Hearing (sense)|Audition]] (how the other's [[human voice|voice]] and movements [[sound]]);
* [[Olfaction]] (how the other smells, naturally or artificially; the wrong smell may be repellent).

As with other animals, [[pheromone]]s may have an impact, though less significantly in the case of humans. Theoretically, the "wrong" pheromone may cause someone to be disliked, even when they would otherwise appear attractive. Frequently, a pleasant-smelling [[perfume]] is used to encourage the member of the opposite sex to more deeply inhale the [[air]] surrounding its wearer,{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}} increasing the [[probability]] that the individual's pheromones will be inhaled. The importance of pheromones in human relationships is probably limited and is widely disputed,{{unreliable source?|date=December 2012}}&lt;ref name="disputed"&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.straightdope.com/classics/a2_206.html | title = Will pheromones make you irresistible to the opposite sex? | work = The Straight Dope | accessdate = November 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; although it appears to have some scientific basis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sciam.com/article.cfm?articleID=0007F9B4-B6D4-1C60-B882809EC588ED9F&amp;sc=I100322 | title = First Evidence of a Human Response to Pheromones | work = ScientificAmerican.com | accessdate = November 30, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many people exhibit high levels of [[sexual fetishism]] and are [[sexually stimulated]] by other stimuli not normally associated with [[sexual arousal]]. The degree to which such fetishism exists or has existed in different cultures is controversial.

Pheromones have been determined to play a role in sexual attraction between people. They influence gonadal hormone secretion, for example, follicle maturation in the ovaries in females and testosterone and sperm production in males.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://evolution.anthro.univie.ac.at/institutes/urbanethology/resources/articles/articles/publications/226-2005-humanPheromones-sexAttraction.pdf |title=doi:10.1016/j.ejogrb.2004.08.010 |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2018-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==High anxiety==
{{primary sources|section|date=December 2012}}
Research conducted by Donald G. Dutton and Arthur P. Aron in the 1970s aimed to find the relation between sexual attraction and high anxiety conditions. In doing so, 85 male participants were contacted by an attractive female interviewer at either a fear-arousing suspension bridge or a normal bridge. Conclusively, it was shown that the male participants who were asked to by the female interviewer to perform the [[thematic apperception test]] (TAT) on the fear-arousing bridge, wrote more sexual content in the stories and attempted, with greater effort, to contact the interviewer after the experiment than those participants who performed the TAT on the normal bridge. In another test, a male participant, chosen from a group of 80, was given anticipated shocks. With him was an attractive female confederate, who was also being shocked. The experiment showed that the male's sexual imagery in the TAT was much higher when self shock was anticipated and not when the female confederate shock was anticipated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dutton|first=Donald G|author2=Arthur P. Aron |title=Some evidence for heightened sexual attraction under conditions of high anxiety|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1974|volume=30|issue=4|doi=10.1037/h0037031|url=http://psycnet.apa.org/journals/psp/30/4/510/|pages=510–7|pmid=4455773}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Enhancement ==
People consciously or subconsciously enhance their sexual attractiveness or sex appeal for a number of reasons. It may be to attract someone with whom they can form a deeper relationship, for [[companionship]], [[procreation]], or an [[intimate relationship]], besides other possible purposes. It can be part of a [[courtship]] process. This can involve physical aspects or interactive processes whereby people find and attract potential partners, and maintain a relationship. These processes, which involve attracting a partner and maintaining sexual interest, can include [[flirting]], which can be used to attract the sexual attention of another to encourage romance or sexual relations, and can involve [[body language]], conversation, joking, or brief physical contact.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sirc.org/publik/flirt.html SIRC Guide to Flirting.

== Sex and sexuality differences ==
Men have been found to have a greater interest in [[Casual sex|uncommitted sex]] compared to women.&lt;ref&gt;Buss, D. M., &amp; Shmitt, D. P. (1993). Sexual strategies theory: A contextual evolutionary analysis of human mating. ‘’Psychological Review’’: 100, 204-232.&lt;/ref&gt; Some research shows this interest to be more sociological than biological.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Conley | first1 = T.

However,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Ellis | first1 = B.J. | last2 = Symons | first2 = D. | year = 1990 | title = Sex differences in sexual fantasy: An evolutionary psychological approach | url = | journal = Journal of Sex Research | volume = 27 | issue = 4| pages = 527–555 | doi=10.1080/00224499009551579}}&lt;/ref&gt; additional trends have been found with a greater sensitivity to [[Social status|partner status]] in women choosing a [[sexual partner]] and men placing a greater emphasis on [[physical attractiveness]] in a potential mate, as well as a significantly greater tendency toward sexual [[jealousy]] in men and emotional jealousy in women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Wiederman | first1 = M. W. | last2 = Allgeier | first2 = E. R. | year = 1992 | title = Gender differences in mate selection criteria: Sociobiological or socioeconomic explanation? | url = | journal = Ethology and Sociobiology | volume = 13 | issue = 2| pages = 115–124 | doi=10.1016/0162-3095(92)90021-u}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bailey, Gaulin, Agyei, and Gladue (1994) analyzed whether these results varied according to [[sexual orientation]]. In general, they found biological sex played a bigger role in the psychology of sexual attraction than orientation. However, there were some differences between homosexual and heterosexual women and men on these factors. While gay and straight men showed similar psychological interest in casual sex on markers of [[Sociosexual orientation|sociosexuality]], gay men showed a larger number of partners in behaviour expressing this interest (proposed to be due to a difference in opportunity). Self-identified lesbian women showed a significantly greater interest in visual sexual stimuli than heterosexual women and judged partner status to be less important in [[Romance (love)|romantic partnerships]]. Heterosexual men had a significantly greater preference for younger partners than homosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Bailey | first1 = J.M. | last2 = Gaulin | first2 = S. | last3 = Agyei | first3 = Y. | last4 = Gladue | first4 = B. | year = 1994 | title = Effects of gender and sexual orientation on evolutionarily relevant aspects of human mating psychology | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 66 | issue = 6| pages = 1081–1093 | doi=10.1037/0022-3514.66.6.1081 | pmid=8046578}}&lt;/ref&gt; People who identify as [[Asexuality|asexual]] may not be sexually attracted to anyone. [[Gray asexuality]] includes those who only experience sexual attraction under certain circumstances; for example, exclusively after an emotional bond has been formed. This tends to vary from person to person.

== Sexual preferences and hormones ==
The [[ovulatory shift hypothesis]] refers to the idea that female humans tend to exhibit different sexual behaviours and desires at points in their cycle, as an evolutionarily adaptive means to ensure that a high quality male is chosen to copulate with during the most fertile period of the cycle.&lt;ref name="Pillsworth" /&gt; It is thought that, due to the length of time and the parental investment involved for a woman to reproduce, changes in female psychology during menstrual periods would help them make critical decisions in mating selection. For example, it has been suggested that women's sexual preferences shift toward more masculine physical characteristics during peak phases of fertility. In such, a symmetrical and masculine face outwardly indicates the reproductive value of a prospective mate.&lt;ref name="Gangestad1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gangestad|first1=S. W.|last2=Thornhill|first2=R.|title=Menstrual cycle variation in women's preferences for the scent of symmetrical men|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=22 May 1998|volume=265|issue=1399|pages=927–933|doi=10.1098/rspb.1998.0380|pmid=9633114|url=http://www.mta.ca/~raiken/Courses/3401/Labs/Lab%20Papers/sym2.pdf|pmc=1689051}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gangestad1998"/&gt;

===Ovulation and female sexual preferences===

There is evidence that women's mate preferences differ across the [[ovarian cycle]]. A meta analysis, investigating 50 studies about whether women's mate preferences for good gene-related male traits changed across the ovarian cycle found that women's preferences change across their cycle: Women show the greatest preference for good gene male traits at their most fertile window.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last=Gildersleeve | first=Kelly | last2=Haselton | first2=Martie G | date=2014 | title=Do Women's Mate Preferences Change Across the Ovulatory Cycle: A Meta Analytic Review | url=http://www.sscnet.ucla.edu/comm/haselton/unify_uploads/files/gildersleeve%20et%20al.%20sex%20roles%202013.pdf | journal=Psychological Bulletin | doi=10.1037/a0035438 | pmid=24564172 | volume=140 | issue=5 | pages=1205–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Female sexual preference for male face shapes has been shown to vary with the probability of conception. Findings showed that during a 'high conception' stage of the menstrual cycle, women were more attracted to men with less feminine/more masculine faces for short-term relationships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Penton-Voak|first1=I. S.|last2=Perrett|first2=D. I.|last3=Castles|first3=D. L.|last4=Kobayashi|first4=T|last5=Burt|first5=D. M.|title=Menstrual cycle alters face preference|journal=Nature|date=June 1999|volume=399|issue=6738|pages=741–742|bibcode=1999Natur.399..741P|doi=10.1038/21557|pmid=10391238}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike men, women's sexual arousal has been found to be generic—it is non-specific to either men or women.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rieger|first=Gerulf|date=2015|title=Sexual arousal and masculinity-femininity of women|url=|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|doi=10.1037/pspp0000077|pmid=26501187|volume=111|issue=2|pages=265–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; The aforementioned research suggests that there may be a possibility that female sexual arousal becomes more sex-specific during the most fertile points of the menstrual cycle.

In males, a masculine face has been positively correlated with fewer respiratory diseases and, as a consequence, masculine features offer a marker of [[health]] and [[reproductive success]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Thornhill|first1=Randy|last2=Gangestad|first2=Steven W.|title=Facial sexual dimorphism, developmental stability, and susceptibility to disease in men and women|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=March 2006|volume=27|issue=2|pages=131–144|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2005.06.001|url=http://facelab.org/bcjones/Teaching/files/Thornhill_2006.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; The preference for masculine faces is only recorded in short-term mate choices. It is therefore suggested that females are attracted to masculine faces only during [[ovulation]] as masculinity reflects a high level of fitness, used to ensure reproductive success. Whilst such preferences may be of lesser importance today, the evolutionary explanation offers reasoning as to why such effects are recorded.

As well as masculinity, females are more sensitive to the scent of males who display high levels of developmental stability.&lt;ref name="Gangestad1998"/&gt; An individual's developmental stability is a measurement of fluctuating asymmetry, defined as their level of deviation from perfect bilateral symmetry. In a comparison of female college students, the results indicated that those normally cycling were more receptive to the scent of shirts worn by symmetrical men when nearing peak fertility in their ovulatory cycle. The same women reported no such preference for the scent of symmetrical men when re-tested during non-fertile stages of the menstrual cycle. Those using the [[Oral contraceptive pill|contraceptive pill]], and therefore not following regular cyclical patterns, reported no such preference.&lt;ref name="Gangestad1998"/&gt;

As with masculine faces, the ability to determine symmetry via scent was likely designed by [[natural selection]] to increase the probability of reproductive success through mating with a male offering strong [[genetics]]. This is evidenced in research focusing on traits of symmetrical males, who consistently record higher levels of IQ, coordination, social dominance, and consequently, greater reproductive fitness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Van Dongen|first1=Stefan|last2=Gangestad|first2=Steven W.|title=Human fluctuating asymmetry in relation to health and quality: a meta-analysis|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|date=November 2011|volume=32|issue=6|pages=380–398|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2011.03.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Pound|first1=N.|last2=Lawson|first2=D. W.|last3=Toma|first3=A. M.|last4=Richmond|first4=S.|last5=Zhurov|first5=A. I.|last6=Penton-Voak|first6=I.

In such, during ovulation, females show a strong preference for symmetrical males as they are reaching peak fertility. As it would be advantageous for asymmetrical men to release a scent similar to that produced by symmetrical males, the female signal used to detect symmetry is presumed to be an honest one (asymmetrical males cannot fake it).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Zahavi|first1=Amotz|title=Mate selection—A selection for a handicap|journal=Journal of Theoretical Biology|date=September 1975|volume=53|issue=1|pages=205–214|doi=10.1016/0022-5193(75)90111-3|pmid=1195756|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/21959410_Mate_Selection-A_Selection_for_a_Handicap}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to this, females have different behavioural preferences towards men during stages in their cycles. It has been found that women have a preference towards more masculine voices during the late-follicular, fertile phase of the menstrual cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Feinberg|first=D. R|last2=Jones|first2=B. C.|last3=Law Smith|first3=M. J.|last4=Moore|first4=F. R.|last5=DeBruine|first5=L. M.|last6=Cornwell|first6=R. E.|last7=Hillier|first7=S. G.|last8=Perrett|first8=D.

This effect has been found to be most significant in women who are less feminine (those with low E3G levels), in comparison to women with higher E3G levels. It has been suggested that this difference in preference is because feminine women (those with high E3G levels) are more successful at obtaining investment. It is not necessary for these women to change their mating preferences during their cycles. More masculine women may make these changes to enhance their chances of achieving investment.

Women have been found to report greater sexual attraction to men other than their own partners when near ovulation compared with the luteal phase. Women whose partners have high developmental stability have greater attraction to men other than their partners when fertile. This can be interpreted as women possessing an adaptation to be attracted to men possessing markers of genetic fitness, therefore sexual attraction depends on the qualities of her partner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gangestad |first1=S. W |last2=Thornhill |first2=R. |last3=Garver-Apgar |first3=C.

===Ovulation and ornamentation===

Hormone levels throughout the menstrual cycle affect a woman's behaviour in preferences and in their overt behaviours. The [[Biological ornament|ornamentation]] effect is a phenomenon influenced by a stage of the menstrual cycle which refers to the way a woman presents herself to others, in a way to attract potential sexual partners. Studies have found that the closer women were to [[Ovulation cycle|ovulation]], the more provocatively they dress and the more attractive they are rated.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haselton|first=Martie G.|last2=Mortezaie|first2=Mina|last3=Pillsworth|first3=Elizabeth G.|last4=Bleske-Rechek|first4=April|last5=Frederick|first5=David A.|date=2007-01-01|title=Ovulatory shifts in human female ornamentation: Near ovulation, women dress to impress|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0018506X06002509|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=51|issue=1|pages=40–45|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2006.07.007|pmid=17045994}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar to the function in animals, it is probable that this ornamentation is to attract potential partners and that a woman's motivations may vary across her cycle.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bullivant|first=Susan B.|last2=Sellergren|first2=Sarah A.|last3=Stern|first3=Kathleen|last4=Spencer|first4=Natasha A.|last5=Jacob|first5=Suma|last6=Mennella|first6=Julie A.|last7=McClintock|first7=Martha K.|date=2004-02-01|title=Women's sexual experience during the menstrual cycle: identification of the sexual phase by noninvasive measurement of luteinizing hormone|journal=Journal of Sex Research|volume=41|issue=1|pages=82–93|doi=10.1080/00224490409552216|issn=0022-4499|pmid=15216427}}&lt;/ref&gt; Research into this relationship has discovered that women who were to attend a [[Nightclub|discothèque]] and rated their clothing as 'sexy' and 'bold,' also stated that their intention for the evening was to flirt and find a partner to go home with.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grammer|first=Karl|last2=Renninger|first2=LeeAnn|last3=Fischer|first3=Bettina|date=2004-02-01|title=Disco clothing, female sexual motivation, and relationship status: is she dressed to impress?|journal=Journal of Sex Research|volume=41|issue=1|pages=66–74|doi=10.1080/00224490409552214|issn=0022-4499|pmid=15216425}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although direct causation cannot be stated, this research suggests that there is a direct link between a woman's ornamentation and her motivation to attract mates.

It is possible that women are sensitive to the changes in their physical attractiveness throughout their cycles, such that at their most fertile stages their levels of attractiveness are increased. Consequently, they choose to display their increased levels of attractiveness through this method of ornamentation.&lt;ref name="Haselton 509–518"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Haselton|first=Martie G.|last2=Gangestad|first2=Steven W.|date=2006-04-01|title=Conditional expression of women's desires and men's mate guarding across the ovulatory cycle|journal=Hormones and Behavior|volume=49|issue=4|pages=509–518|doi=10.1016/j.yhbeh.2005.10.006|issn=0018-506X|pmid=16403409}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During periods of hormonal imbalance, women exhibit a peak in sexual activity.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Adams | first1 = D. B. | last2 = Gold | first2 = A. R. | last3 = Burt | first3 = B. A. | year = 1978 | title = Rise in female-initiated sexual activity at ovulation and its suppression by [[oral contraceptives]] | url = | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 299 | issue = 21| pages = 1145–1150 | doi=10.1056/nejm197811232992101}}&lt;/ref&gt; As these findings have been recorded for female-initiated sexual activity and not for male-initiated activity, the causation appears to be hormonal changes during the menstrual cycle.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In addition, studies have found that women report themselves to be significantly more flirtatious with men, other than their partners, during the most fertile stages of their cycle,&lt;ref name="Gangestad 975–982"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gangestad|first=Steven W|last2=Thornhill|first2=Randy|last3=Garver|first3=Christine E|date=2002-05-07|title=Changes in women's sexual interests and their partners' mate-retention tactics across the menstrual cycle: evidence for shifting conflicts of interest.|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|volume=269|issue=1494|pages=975–982|doi=10.1098/rspb.2001.1952|issn=0962-8452|pmc=1690982|pmid=12028782}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as a greater desire to attend parties or nightclubs where there is the potential to meet male partners.&lt;ref name="Haselton 509–518"/&gt;

Research has also found that menstrual cycles affect sexual behaviour frequency in pre-[[menopausal]] women. For example, women who had weekly sexual intercourse with men had menstrual cycles with the average duration of 29 days, while women with less frequent sexual interactions tended to have more extreme cycle lengths.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cutler|first1=Winnifred, B.|last2=Garcia|first2=Celso, R.|last3=Freiger|first3=Abba|title=Sexual Behaviour Frequency and menstrual cycle length in mature premenopausal women|journal=Psychoneuroendocrinology|date=December 1978|volume=4|issue=4|pages=297–309|pmid=523588|doi=10.1016/0306-4530(79)90014-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Male response to ovulation===
Changes in hormones during a female's cycles affect the way she behaves and the way males behave towards her. Research has found that men are a lot more attentive and loving towards their partners when they are in the most [[Fertility|fertile]] phase of their cycles, in comparison to when they are in the [[luteal]] phases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pillsworth|first=Elizabeth G.|last2=Haselton|first2=Martie G.|date=2006-07-01|title=Male sexual attractiveness predicts differential ovulatory shifts in female extra-pair attraction and male mate retention|url=http://www.ehbonline.org/article/S1090-5138(05)00093-0/abstract|journal=Evolution and Human Behavior|language=English|volume=27|issue=4|pages=247–258|doi=10.1016/j.evolhumbehav.2005.10.002|issn=1090-5138}}&lt;/ref&gt; Men become increasingly [[Sexual jealousy|jealous and possessive]] over their partners during this stage.&lt;ref name="Gangestad 975–982"/&gt; It is highly likely that these changes in male behaviour is a result of the female partner's increased desire to seek and flirt with other males. Therefore, these behavioural [[adaptation]]s have developed as a form of [[mate guarding]], which increases the male's likelihood of maintaining the relationship and increasing chances of reproductive success.

[[File:Kashmir 2016.png|thumb|Kashmiri youth throwing stones at Indian armed forces during 2016 Kashmir Unrest]]
'''Stone throwing''' or '''rock throwing''' is the act of throwing a [[stone]]. When it is directed at another person (called '''stone pelting''' in India), it is a form of criminal [[assault]].

==History==
Throwing of rocks or stones is one of the most ancient forms of ranged-weapon combat, with [[sling (weapon)|slings]] used to increase the range of such projectiles having been found among other weapons in the tomb of [[Tutankhamen]], who died about 1325 BC.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ashmolean.museum/gri/carter/585y-p1324.html Image of sling from the Tomb of Tutankhamen] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060403131635/https://www.ashmolean.museum/gri/carter/585y-p1324.html |date=2006-04-03 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; In many places, rocks are readily available as weapons, more so than more sophisticated weapons. Because rocks are dense, hard objects, a forcefully thrown rock can do substantial damage to a target, particularly if the rock has sharp or jagged edges.

Historically, [[stoning]] was used as a method of [[human execution]] in several cultures.

==At vehicles==

Rocks thrown at cars moving along highways at high speeds have been a problem in a number of countries.&lt;ref name=Janzen&gt;{{cite news|last1=Janzen|first1=Eric|title=13 rock-throwing incidents reported along I-35 since June|url=http://kxan.com/2014/11/04/13-rock-throwing-incidents-reported-along-i-35-since-june/|accessdate=12 April 2015|publisher=KXAN|date=4 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Beavin&gt;{{cite news|last1=Beavin|first1=Angie|title=Man still in rehab months after rock was thrown from overpass|url=http://kxan.com/2014/11/03/man-still-in-rehab-months-after-rock-was-thrown-from-overpass/|accessdate=12 April 2015|publisher=KXAN|date=3 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wndshield&gt;{{cite news|title=Sharon Twp woman critical after rock thrown through car windshield|url=http://www.wkyc.com/story/news/local/summit-county/2014/07/15/sharon-twp-woman-critical-after-rock-thrown-through-car-windshield/12688955//|accessdate=12 April 2015|agency=AP|publisher=WKYX|date=15 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=injured&gt;{{cite news|title=Teens tell court they 'never thought they would hurt anyone' when they tossed 5lb rock onto military mother's car from overpass leaving her critically injured|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2728590/Teen-testifies-against-pal-rock-throwing-case.html#ixzz3X7rBQHaX|accessdate=12 April 2015|agency=AP|publisher=Daily Mail|date=19 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Greenberg&gt;{{cite news|last1=Greenberg|first1=Lara|title=Arrests Made in Rock-Throwing Incident that Critically Injured Woman|url=http://wnep.com/2014/07/11/rock-thrown-from-interstate-overpass-injures-woman-in-car/|accessdate=12 April 2015|publisher=WNEP|date=11 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Mirror&gt;{{cite news|title=395 reports of yobs throwing rocks from motorway bridges is tip of iceberg|url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/395-reports-of-yobs-throwing-rocks-1675875|accessdate=13 April 2015|publisher=Daily Mirror|date=12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Malaga&gt;{{cite news|title=Man arrested for throwing rocks from A7 Motorway|url=http://www.euroweeklynews.com/news/costa-de-almeria/item/90619-man-arrested-for-throwing-rocks-from-a7-motorway|accessdate=13 April 2015|publisher=Euro Weekly News|date=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Austin, Texas police detective Jarrett Crippen "When we’re talking about highway speeds of 60, 70 mph, that rock is hitting you full-force...

Thrown rocks can kill in a number of ways; a rock can hit a passenger directly in the head with [[deadly force|lethal force]], a rock can strike the driver causing him or her to lose control of the car and crash, the "jolt and shock of a barrage of stones smashing against the front windshield" can cause the driver to lose control and crash, or the out of control vehicle can slam into a passing car, causing it to crash.&lt;ref name=Medoff&gt;[[Rafael Medoff]], [http://www.jns.org/latest-articles/2015/5/3/baltimore-riot-mom-needed-in-jerusalem#.VUmBPY6qqko= 'Baltimore ‘riot mom’ needed in Jerusalem,'] [[JNS.org]] 3 May 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal background===

In the 18th century, [[William Blackstone]] stated that throwing stones in a town or city on a highway, when it caused a death, was to be defined as [[manslaughter]] rather than murder.&lt;ref&gt;Sir [[William Blackstone]], [https://books.google.com/books?id=jiJAtfLSg_sC&amp;pg=PA174 ''A Summary of the Constitutional Laws of England Being an Abridgement of Blackstone's Commentaries,''] John Trusler 1796 pp.175-176&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Burnett, Robert Craigie [https://books.google.com/books?id=rNRLAQAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA30 ''A treatise on various branches of the criminal law of Scotland,''] Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme, and Brown, London, 1811 p.30&lt;/ref&gt;

Many notorious and deadly riots have begun with rock throwing, or included rock throwing as violence escalated, including the Toronto [[Jubilee riots]], the [[Boston Massacre]], and the [[2014 Hrushevskoho Street riots]] in the Ukraine.

===Kashmir===
{{Main|Stone Pelting in Kashmir}}
{{see also|2018 Shopian firing incident}}
Throwing of stones at Indian Armed Forces and Police is frequent in the Indian province of [[Kashmir]]. Usually carried out by youths, in the local language it is called "Kanni Jung", which means ''fighting with stones'' and the stone pelters are called as ''Sangbaaz''.&lt;ref name="theanalystworld1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theanalystworld.com/stone-pelting-and-kashmiri-youth/ |title=Stone Pelting and Kashmiri Youth |publisher=The Analyst World |date=2014-06-20 |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are claims that the rocks are thrown in response to killings of Kashmiri youth at the hands of forces.&lt;ref name="thehindu1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.thehindu.com/opinion/lead/Understanding-Kashmirs-stone-pelters/article16120870.ece |title=Understanding Kashmir's stone pelters |newspaper=[[The Hindu]] |date= |accessdate=2017-04-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; But as per the [[Dailymail]], [[India Today]] Television's underground reporters interviewed some of the stonepelters where stonepelters revealed they are being paid 5000-7000 rupees per month and are being given some clothes and shoes by the Anti-India forces for pelting stones on Indian army.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/indiahome/indianews/article-4362020/Kashmiri-stone-pelters-admit-paid-film.html|title=This is our bread and butter': Undercover reporters film Kashmiri 'stone-pelters' admit to being paid Rs 7,000 a month for throwing stones and Molotovs at Indian forces|author=Jamshed Khan, Sushant Pathak|date=29 March 2017|access-date=5 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal background===
Rock throwing has been in the past often adopted as a method by an unarmed population to protest a governing power's authority. Under English [[common law]], soldiers were not permitted to shoot at civilians engaged in this kind of protest, unless their lives were in danger or they obtained beforehand an express order from a civil magistrate. &lt;blockquote&gt;At one point, when town officials tried to arrest a British officer who was commanding the guard at Boston Neck, Captain Ponsonby Molesworth intervened to confront a stone-throwing crowd. Molesworth ordered the soldiers to bayonet anyone throwing stones who got too close. A Boston justice told him that, under common law, a bayonet thrust was not an act of self-defense against a stone, which was not a lethal weapon. Had a soldier killed anyone, Molesworth could have been tried for his life.'&lt;ref&gt;John Murrin, Paul Johnson, James McPherson, Alice Fahs, Gary Gerstle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=5_Y2LhgrpToC&amp;pg=PA183 : ''Liberty, Equality, Power: A History of the American People,''] Cengage Learning, 2011 p.183&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==At people==

Rock-throwing can be used by thieves, as demonstrated by a 2015 case in India in which Ratan Marwadi (45) was charged with throwing rocks at a random passer-by, Darshana Pawar, for the purpose of disabling and robbing her. Pawar was killed. Her murderer, Ratan Marwadi, had previously served time in jail for pelting rail commuters with stones with the intent of robbing them.&lt;ref name=Gupta&gt;{{cite news|last1=Gupta|first1=Pradeep|title=Stone-thrower held for death of commuter|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/mumbai/Stone-thrower-held-for-death-of-commuter/articleshow/46363646.cms|accessdate=18 September 2015|publisher=[[Times of India]]|date=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legal status===

In the 19th century, "stone throwing" was defined as a "nuisance", one of a number of offenses such as "kite-flying" and "doorbell ringing" to be handled by bylaws which differed from town to town.&lt;ref&gt;Steve Sturdy, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ITR_04uCbHkC&amp;pg=PA194 ''Medicine, Health and the Public Sphere in Britain, 1600-2000,''] Routledge 2013 p.194.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Across borders==

===United States - Mexico===

{{see also|Lonnie Swartz, José Rodríguez border incident}}
Rock-throwers on the Mexican side of the border between the United States and Mexico frequently target [[United States Border Patrol]] agents with barrages of rocks to prevent them from apprehending individuals illegally crossing the border, particularly smugglers moving illegal drugs or illegal migrants across the border.&lt;ref name=Medrano&gt;{{cite news|last1=Medrano|first1=Lourdes|title=Bullets vs. rocks?

===Spain - Morocco===

In recent years, increasing numbers of undocumented sub-Saharan Africans have passed through Morocco attempting to reach European Union countries, many attempt to enter Spanish soil at two Spanish enclaves, [[Melilla]] and [[Ceuta]], located on the African side of the Mediterranean Sea. On several occasions, Moroccan and Spanish border authorities have defended lethal violence against African [[illegal immigrant]]s near the [[Melilla border fence]] and [[Ceuta border fence]] by asserting that groups of migrants attempting to storm the border in mass-entry events threw rocks to drive border guards away from the gates.&lt;ref name=Abad&gt;{{cite news|last1=Abad|first1=Rocio|title=Immigrant death toll from assault on Ceuta beach border could rise to 14|url=http://elpais.com/elpais/2014/02/07/inenglish/1391774548_753814.html|accessdate=13 April 2015|publisher=El Pais|date=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MelillaFox&gt;{{cite news|title=Spain: 400 migrants repelled after charging Moroccan guards, storming Melilla border fence|url=http://www.foxnews.com/world/2015/02/01/spain-400-migrants-repelled-after-charging-moroccan-guards-storming-melilla/|accessdate=13 April 2015|agency=AP|publisher=Fox News|date=1 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ElHadad&gt;{{cite news|last1=El Hadad|first1=Horia|title=African migrants climb their way into Spain|url=http://www.aljazeera.com/indepth/features/2014/06/african-migrants-climb-their-way-into-spain-201468133328621674.html|accessdate=13 April 2015|publisher=Al Jazeera|date=10 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Davies&gt;{{cite news|last1=Davies|first1=Nick|title=Melilla: Europe's dirty secret|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/apr/17/melilla-migrants-eu-spain-morocco|accessdate=13 April 2015|publisher=The Guardian|date=16 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Egypt - Gaza===

Stone throwing rioters have repeatedly clashed with Egyptian troops at the [[Egypt-Gaza border]].
* In 2008, Gazans assaulted Egyptian border guards by throwing barrages of rocks over the low, concrete border wall topped with barbed wire, then tore down a section of the wall, opening a road and moving goods and people across for several hours before the Egyptian Army, avoiding the use of lethal force, managed to regain control of the border.&lt;ref name=Erlanger&gt;{{cite news|last1=Erlanger|first1=Steven|title=Egypt Tries to Plug Border; Gazans Poke New Hole|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/01/26/world/middleeast/26gaza.html|accessdate=14 April 2015|publisher=New York Times|date=26 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="20988">'''U.S. standard clothing sizes''' for women were originally developed from statistical data in the 1940s and 1950s. At that time, they were similar in concept to the [[EN 13402]] European clothing size standard, although individual manufacturers have always deviated from them, sometimes significantly.

However, as a result of various cultural pressures, most notably [[vanity sizing]], North American clothing sizes have drifted substantially away from this standard over time, and now have very little connection to it. Instead, they now follow the more loosely defined standards known as [[US standard clothing size#Conversion from catalog sizes|U.S. catalog sizes]].

Body measurements below are given in inches.

==History==

Men's standard sizes were probably developed first during the [[American Revolutionary War]], and they were in regular use by the American army during the [[War of 1812]] for ready-made uniforms {{harv|Felsenthal|2012}}. These were based on the chest measurement, with other measurements being assumed to be either proportional (the circumference of the neck, waist, hips, and thighs) or easily altered (length of the inseam) {{harv|Felsenthal|2012}}.

As this was largely successful in men, the same approach was attempted in the early 20th century for women using the bust as the sole measurement {{harv|Felsenthal|2012}}. However, this proved unsuccessful because women's bodies have far more variety in shape. The [[hourglass figure]] is frequently used as an industry standard, but only 8% of women have this body shape {{harv|Felsenthal|2012}}. A woman with an hourglass figure and a woman with an apple-shaped figure who have the same bust size will not have the same waist or hip sizes.

This was a significant problem for mail-order companies, and several attempts at predictable, standard sizing were made {{harv|Felsenthal|2012}}. In the 1940s, the statisticians Ruth O'Brien and William Shelton received a [[Works Progress Administration]] grant to conduct the most ambitious effort to solve this problem. Their team measured almost 15,000 women across the US. After discovering the complex diversity of women's actual sizes, which produced five to seven different body shapes, they proposed a three-part sizing system. Each size would be the combination of a single number, representing an upper body measurement, plus an indicator for height (short, regular, and long) and an indication for girth (slim, regular, and stout).  The various combinations of height and girth resulted in nine different sizes for each numerical upper-body measurement, which was highly impractical for manufacturing {{harv|Felsenthal|2012}}.

As a result, O'Brien and Shelton's work was rejected. In 1958, the [[National Bureau of Standards]] invented a new sizing system, based on the hourglass figure and using only the bust size to create an arbitrary standard of sizes ranging from 8 to 38, with an indication for height (short, regular, and tall) and lower-body girth (plus or minus). The resulting commercial standard was not widely popular, and was declared voluntary in 1970 and withdrawn entirely in 1983. In 1995, [[ASTM International]] published its own voluntary standard, which has been revised since then {{harv|Felsenthal|2012}}. It has not been widely adopted.

==Women's sizes==
Women's sizes are divided into various types, depending on height. These charts give an indication of size only and are by no means exact as they vary from manufacturer to manufacturer, sometimes by a full inch up and down.

=== Overview ===
There are multiple size types, designed to fit somewhat different body shapes.  Variations include the height of the person's [[torso]] (known as ''back length''), whether the bust, waist, and hips are straighter (characteristic of teenagers) or curvier (like many adult women), and whether the bust is higher or lower (characteristic of younger and older women, respectively). These categories include:

;Misses sizes:  The most common size category.  For women of about average height (5'4") with an average bust height and an hourglass figure.  Dress sizes may be given as girth at the bust in inches (e.g., 36), but even-numbered sizes from 2 to 16 are more common.  Categorical sizes range from XS (extra-small) to XL (extra-large).
;Junior sizes: For short women with higher busts and fairly straight bodies.  Junior sizes are commonly given as odd-numbered sizes from 1 to 15, which correspond to the next number up in misses' sizes.
;Women's sizes '''or''' plus sizes:  For larger women of average height, sometimes with lower bust lines.  Like misses' sizes, the sizes may be given as a dress size based on the bust measurement, but they are usually given as even-numbered sizes from 18 up.  Categorical sizes usually range from 1X (similar to extra-large, but with slightly different proportions compared to the misses' size) up.
;Misses petite: For short women with average busts and more hourglass body shapes.  Sizes follow the misses' standard and are marked with a P, as in 10P.
;Junior petite: For very short women with average busts and fairly straight bodies.  Size may be denoted as "5JP" or as "5P".
;Women's petite:  For larger, shorter women, sometimes with lower bust lines.  Sizes are marked the same as women's with a P, as in 20P.
;Young junior: For short women with high busts and fairly straight bodies.
;Tall sizes:  For taller women (usually 5'8" or above), usually with a proportionately average bust height and an hourglass figure.  Sizes are usually written with the corresponding misses' size and a T to indicate tall, as in "10T".
;Half sizes: For short women with lower busts and more hourglass body shapes.  Sizes are written with a ½, as in "10½".

With the average American woman's height (20 years and older) at about 63.8" or approximately 5'4" (162.1&amp;nbsp;cm) {{harv|Department of Health|2012}}, both standard and catalog size ranges attempt to address a variety of weights / builds as well as providing for the "shorter-than-average" height woman with "petite" and "half-sizes". However "taller-than-average" women may find their size-height addressed by manufacturers less frequently, and may often find themselves facing issues of slightly too short pant legs and sleeve cuffs, as well as waist lengths.
