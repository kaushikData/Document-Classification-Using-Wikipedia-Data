On the morning of March 9, 2012, a particularly devastating and long-lived [[hail]]storm hit the Hawaiian islands of [[Oahu]] and [[Lanai]]. The hailstorm was produced by a [[supercell]] [[thunderstorm]]. This event produced the largest hailstone ever recorded in Hawaii since records began in 1950. The hailstone was measured at {{convert|4.5|in|cm|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} long, {{convert|2.25|in|cm|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} tall, and {{convert|2|in|cm|sigfig=1|abbr=on}} wide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://content.usatoday.com/communities/sciencefair/post/2012/03/hailstone-hawaii-state-record/1#.T247qdW1O8s|title=Hailstone sets state record in Hawaii|date=March 23, 2012|accessdate=March 24, 2012|work=USA Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[National Weather Service]] meteorologist Tom Birchard stated that the event was "unprecedented."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/national-weather-service-stormy-weather-brings-unprecedented-hail-storms-over-hawaii/2012/03/09/gIQASKeh1R_story.html|title=National Weather Service: Stormy weather brings ‘unprecedented’ hail storms over Hawaii|author=National Weather Service|date=March 9, 2012|accessdate=March 9, 2012|work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to spectacular early-morning lightning storms and flooding from the four feet (3.3 meters) of rainfall received, a [[Tornado|tornadic]] [[waterspout]] formed off the coast of Oahu during the morning of March 9, 2012. Non-supercullar waterspouts are not uncommon (the State of Hawaii records an average of one [[List of Hawaii tornadoes|waterspout/tornado per year]]), this [[mesocyclone]]-induced waterspout tracked inland for 1.5 miles, becoming an EF0 tornado that caused minor damage to the Enchanted Lakes subdivision of [[Kailua, Hawaii County, Hawaii|Kailua]] at 7:10&amp;nbsp;am Hawaiian-Aleutian Time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hawaiinewsnow.com/global/Story.asp?s=4680664 Hawaii News Now (KGMB-TV and KHNL-TV)]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''blizzard''' is a severe [[Winter storm|snowstorm]] characterized by strong sustained winds of at least {{convert|35|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} and lasting for a prolonged period of time—typically three hours or more. A [[ground blizzard]] is a weather condition where snow is not falling but loose snow on the ground is lifted and blown by strong winds. Blizzards can have an immense size and usually stretch to hundreds or thousands of kilometres.

[[File:Tochal sport complex 16.jpg|thumb|Blizzard into [[Tochal Complex|Tochal Skiing resort]], [[Tehran]] and involved skiers.]]

==Definition and etymology==
In the United States, the [[National Weather Service]] defines a blizzard as a severe [[snow]] [[Winter storm|storm]] characterized by strong winds causing [[blowing snow]] that results in low visibilities. The difference between a blizzard and a snowstorm is the strength of the wind, not the amount of snow. To be a blizzard, a snow storm must have sustained winds or frequent gusts that are greater than or equal to {{convert|56|km/h|abbr=on}} with blowing or drifting snow which reduces [[visibility]] to {{convert|400|m|mi|abbr=on|disp=or}} or less and must last for a prolonged period of time—typically three hours or more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.weather.gov/glossary/index.php?letter=b|title=Blizzard at the US National Weather Service glossary |publisher=Weather.gov |date=2009-06-25 |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ussartf.org/blizzards.htm|title=Blizzards|website=www.ussartf.org|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While severe cold and large amounts of [[snowdrift|drifting snow]] may accompany blizzards, they are not required. Blizzards can bring [[Whiteout (weather)|whiteout]] conditions, and can paralyze regions for days at a time, particularly where snowfall is unusual or rare.

A severe blizzard has winds over {{convert|72|km/h|abbr=on}}, near zero visibility, and temperatures of {{convert|-12|C|}} or lower.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/69478/blizzard "Blizzard"] ''Encyclopædia Britannica Online'' retrieved 17 March 2012&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Antarctica]], blizzards are associated with winds spilling over the edge of the ice plateau at an average velocity of {{convert|160|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

[[Ground blizzard]] refers to a weather condition where loose snow or ice on the ground is lifted and blown by strong winds. The primary difference between a ground blizzard as opposed to a regular blizzard is that in a ground blizzard no precipitation is produced at the time, but rather all the precipitation is already present in the form of snow or ice at the surface.
[[File:Old farm at Overtown in deep snow in 1963.jpg|thumb|Drifted snow near [[Burrow-with-Burrow]], Lancashire, England, January 1963]]
The Australia Bureau of [[Meteorology]] describes a blizzard as, "Violent and very cold wind which is laden with snow, some part, at least, of which has been raised from snow covered ground."
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/info/wwords/ |title=Blizzard definition, Weather Words, Australian Government Bureau of Meteorology |publisher=Bom.gov.au |date= |accessdate=2012-08-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'' concludes the term ''blizzard'' is likely onomatopoeic, derived from the same sense as ''blow, blast, blister, and bluster''; the first recorded use of it for weather dates to 1829, when it was defined as a "violent blow". It achieved its modern definition by 1859, when it was in use in the [[western United States]]. The term became common in the press during the harsh winter of 1880–81.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Entry for Blizzard|publisher=[[Oxford English Dictionary]]|url=http://www.oed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States storm systems==
[[File:Duluth blizzard, December 2007.jpg|thumb|Duluth blizzard, December 2007|[[Duluth, Minnesota]] blizzard, March 2007]]
[[File:Blizzard2 - NOAA.jpg|thumb|March blizzard in North Dakota, 1966.]]

In the United States, storm systems powerful enough to cause blizzards usually form when the [[jet stream]] dips far to the south, allowing cold, dry polar air from the north to clash with warm, humid air moving up from the south.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.weather.com/encyclopedia/winter/blizzard.html weather.com - Storm Encyclopedia&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130211082356/http://www.weather.com/encyclopedia/winter/blizzard.html |date=February 11, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When cold, moist air from the Pacific Ocean moves eastward to the [[Rocky Mountains]] and the [[Great Plains]], and warmer, moist air moves north from the [[Gulf of Mexico]], all that is needed is a movement of cold polar air moving south to form potential blizzard conditions that may extend from the [[Texas Panhandle]] to the [[Great Lakes]] and [[Midwest]]. A blizzard also may be formed when a cold front and warm front mix together and a blizzard forms at the border line.

Another storm system occurs when a cold core low over the [[Hudson Bay]] area in Canada is displaced southward over southeastern Canada, the Great Lakes, and [[New England]]. When the rapidly moving cold front collides with warmer air coming north from the [[Gulf of Mexico]], strong surface winds, significant cold air [[advection]], and extensive wintry precipitation occur.

[[Image:Nearwhiteoutinminnesota.JPG|thumb|Conditions approaching a blizzard whiteout in [[Minnesota]], on March 1, 2007. Note the unclear horizon near the center.]]

[[Low pressure systems]] moving out of the Rocky Mountains onto the Great Plains, a broad expanse of flat land, much of it covered in [[prairie]], [[steppe]] and [[grassland]], can cause thunderstorms and rain to the south and heavy snows and strong winds to the north. With few trees or other obstructions to reduce wind and blowing, this part of the country is particularly vulnerable to blizzards with very low temperatures and [[whiteout (weather)|whiteout]] conditions. In a true whiteout there is no visible horizon. People can become lost in their own front yards, when the door is only {{convert|10|ft|m|0|order=flip|abbr=on}} away, and they would have to feel their way back. Motorists have to stop their cars where they are, as the road is impossible to see.

===Nor'easter blizzards===
[[File:TotallyFreeImages com-281074-Standard-preview.jpg|thumb|left|200 px|Illustration of the Great Blizzard of 1888]]

A [[nor'easter]] is a macro-scale [[storm]] that occurs off the New England and [[Atlantic Canada]] coastlines. It gets its name from the direction the wind is coming from. The usage of the term in North America comes from the wind associated with many different types of storms some of which can form in the North Atlantic Ocean and some of which form as far south as the Gulf of Mexico. The term is most often used in the coastal areas of [[New England]] and [[Atlantic Canada]]. This type of storm has characteristics similar to a [[hurricane]]. More specifically it describes a [[low-pressure area]] whose center of [[rotation]] is just off the coast and whose leading winds in the left-forward quadrant rotate onto land from the northeast. High storm waves may sink ships at sea and cause coastal flooding and beach erosion. Notable nor'easters include The [[Great Blizzard of 1888]], one of the worst blizzards in U.S. history. It dropped {{convert|40|-|50|in|cm|order=flip|abbr=on}} of snow and had sustained winds of more than {{convert|45|mph}} that produced snowdrifts in excess of {{convert|50|ft|m}}. Railroads were shut down and people were confined to their houses for up to a week. It killed 400 people, mostly in [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;New York&lt;/ref&gt;

===1972 Iran blizzard===
The [[1972 Iran blizzard|1972 Iran Blizzard]], which caused 4,000 reported deaths, was the deadliest blizzard in recorded history. Dropping as much as {{convert|26|feet|meters}} of snow, it completely covered 200 villages. After a snowfall lasting nearly a week, an area the size of [[Wisconsin]] was entirely buried in snow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/29930/40-years-ago-iran-was-hit-deadliest-blizzard-history|title=40 Years Ago, Iran Was Hit by the Deadliest Blizzard in History|date=7 February 2012|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.skyandweather.net/2014/02/1972Iransnowstorm.html|title=بوران ۱۳۵۰: شدیدترین بوران تاریخ معاصر ایران و جهان|website=www.skyandweather.net|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Snow Winter of 1880–1881===
[[File:Train stuck in snow.jpg|thumb|A snow blockade in southern Minnesota, central US. On March 29, 1881, snowdrifts in Minnesota were higher than locomotives.]]

The winter of 1880–1881 is widely considered the most severe winter ever known in parts of the United States. Many children—and their parents—learned of "The Snow Winter" through the children's book ''[[The Long Winter (novel)|The Long Winter]]'' by [[Laura Ingalls Wilder]], in which the author tells of her family's efforts to survive. The snow arrived in October 1880 and blizzard followed blizzard throughout the winter and into March 1881, leaving many areas snowbound throughout the entire winter. Accurate details in Wilder's novel include the blizzards' frequency and the deep cold, the [[Chicago and North Western Railway]] stopping trains until the spring thaw because the snow made the tracks impassable, the near-starvation of the townspeople, and the courage of her future husband Almanzo and another man, who ventured out on the open prairie in search of a cache of wheat that no one was even sure existed.

The October blizzard brought snowfalls so deep that two-story homes had snow up to the second floor windows. No one was prepared for the deep snow so early in the season and farmers all over the region were caught before their crops had even been harvested, their grain milled, or with their fuel supplies for the winter in place. By January the train service was almost entirely suspended from the region. Railroads hired scores of men to dig out the tracks but it was a wasted effort: As soon as they had finished shoveling a stretch of line, a new storm arrived, filling up the line and leaving their work useless.

There were no winter thaws and on February 2, 1881, a second massive blizzard struck that lasted for nine days. In the towns the streets were filled with solid drifts to the tops of the buildings and tunneling was needed to secure passage about town. Homes and barns were completely covered, compelling farmers to tunnel to reach and feed their stock.

When the snow finally melted in late spring of 1881, huge sections of the plains were flooded. Massive ice jams clogged the [[Missouri River]] and when they broke the downstream areas were ravaged. Most of the town of [[Yankton, South Dakota|Yankton]], in what is now South Dakota, was washed away when the river overflowed its banks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.archives.gov/publications/prologue/2003/winter/little-town-in-nara-2.html|title=Prologue|date=8 March 2012|work=archives.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://files.usgwarchives.net/sd/history/robinson/liii.txt|title=Chapter LIII: Dakota Territory History – 1880–1881|work=History of South Dakota|author=Doane Robinson|volume=1|date=1904|p=306–309}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Storm of the Century===
[[File:1993 Storm of the Century Asheville, North Carolina snowfall.jpg|thumb|Under the weight of snow, a tree falls next to a car in [[Asheville, North Carolina]]]]

The [[1993 Storm of the Century|Storm of the Century]], also known as the Great Blizzard of 1993, was a large [[cyclone|cyclonic]] storm that formed over the [[Gulf of Mexico]] on March 12, 1993, and dissipated in the North Atlantic Ocean on March 15. It is unique for its intensity, massive size and wide-reaching effect. At its height, the storm stretched from Canada towards Central America, but its main impact was on the United States and Cuba. The cyclone moved through the Gulf of Mexico, and then through the Eastern United States before moving into Canada. Areas as far south as northern Alabama and Georgia received a dusting of snow and areas such as [[Birmingham, Alabama]], received up to {{convert|12|in|cm|abbr=on}} &lt;ref name="ncdc-event-details"&gt;{{cite web| title = Event Details | author = [[National Climatic Data Center]] | url = http://www4.ncdc.noaa.gov/cgi-win/wwcgi.dll?wwevent~ShowEvent~194933 |accessdate=December 22, 2010|year=1993|publisher=[[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; with [[Wind#Wind force scale|hurricane-force]] wind gusts and record low [[barometric pressure]]s. Between Louisiana and Cuba, hurricane-force winds produced high storm surges across northwestern Florida, which along with scattered [[tornado]]es killed dozens of people. In the United States, the storm was responsible for the loss of [[electricity|electric power]] to over 10&amp;nbsp;million customers. It is purported to have been directly experienced by nearly 40&amp;nbsp;percent of the country's population at that time. A total of 310 people, including 10 from Cuba, perished during this storm. The storm cost $6 to $10 billion in damages.

* Great Plains Easter Blizzard of 1873. April 13, 1873
* Seattle Blizzard of 1880. January 6, 1880. Seattle area's greatest snowstorm to date. An estimated four feet fell around the town. Many barns collapsed and all transportation halted.&lt;ref name="The American Weather Book pg 7"/&gt;
* The Snow Winter of 1880–1881. Laura Ingalls Wilder's book: The Long Winter details the effects of the blizzards in the Dakota territory of the winter of 1880–1881.
* In the three year winter period from December 1885 to March 1888, the Great Plains and Eastern United States suffered a series of the worst blizzards in this nation's history ending with the Schoolhouse Blizzard and the Great NYC Blizzard of 1888. The massive explosion of the volcano [[1883 eruption of Krakatoa|Krakatoa]] in the South Pacific late in August 1883 is a suspected cause of these huge blizzards during these several years. The clouds of ash it emitted continued to circulate around the world for many years. Weather patterns continued to be chaotic for years, and temperatures did not return to normal until 1888. Record rainfall was experienced in Southern California during July 1883 to June 1884. The Krakatoa eruption injected an unusually large amount of sulfur dioxide (SO2) gas high into the stratosphere which reflects sunlight and helped cool the planet over the next few years until the suspended atmospheric sulfur fell to ground.
* Plains Blizzard of late 1885. In Kansas, heavy snows of late 1885 had piled drifts ten feet high.&lt;ref name="kshs.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.kshs.org/kansapedia/blizzard-of-1886/11982|title=Blizzard of 1886         - Kansapedia - Kansas Historical Society|website=www.kshs.org|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kansas Blizzard of 1886. First week of January 1886. Reported that 80 percent of the cattle were frozen to death in that state alone from the cold and snow.&lt;ref name="kshs.org"/&gt;
* [[January 1886 blizzard|January 1886 Blizzard]]. January 9, 1886. Same system as Kansas 1886 Blizzard that traveled eastward.
* Great Plains Blizzards of late 1886. On November 13, 1886 it reportedly began to snow and did not stop for a month in the Great Plains region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.acsu.buffalo.edu/~insrisg/nature/nw04/0119Blizzards.htm|title=Blizzard Years|website=www.acsu.buffalo.edu|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Great Plains Blizzard of 1887. January 9–11, 1887. Reported 72-hour blizzard that covered parts of the Great Plains in more than 16 inches of snow. Winds whipped and temperatures dropped to around −50F. So many cows that weren’t killed by the cold soon died from starvation. When spring arrived, millions of the animals were dead, with around 90 percent of the open range’s cattle rotting where they fell. Those present reported carcasses as far as the eye could see. Dead cattle clogged up rivers and spoiled drinking water. Many ranchers went bankrupt and others simply called it quits and moved back east. The "Great Die-Up" from the blizzard effectively concluded the romantic period of the great Plains cattle drives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

*[[Schoolhouse Blizzard|Schoolhouse Blizzard of 1888]] North American Great Plains. January 12–13, 1888. What made the storm so deadly was the timing (during work and school hours), the suddenness, and the brief spell of warmer weather that preceded it. In addition, the very strong wind fields behind the cold front and the powdery nature of the snow reduced visibilities on the open plains to zero. People ventured from the safety of their homes to do chores, go to town, attend school, or simply enjoy the relative warmth of the day. As a result, thousands of people—including many schoolchildren—got caught in the blizzard.
*[[Great Blizzard of 1888|Great Blizzard of March 1888]] March 11–14, 1888. One of the most severe recorded blizzards in the history of the United States. On March 12, an unexpected northeaster hit New England and the mid-Atlantic, dropping up to {{convert|50|in|cm|abbr=on|}} of snow in the space of three days. New York City experienced its heaviest snowfall recorded to date at that time, all street railcars were stranded, and the storm lead to the creation of the NYC subway system. Snowdrifts reached up to the second story of some buildings. Some 400 people died from this blizzard, including many sailors aboard vessels that were beset by gale-force winds and turbulent seas.
*[[Great Blizzard of 1899]] February 11–14, 1899. An extremely unusual blizzard in that it reached into the far southern states of the US. It hit in February, and the area around Washington, D.C., experienced 51 hours straight of snowfall. The port of New Orleans was totally iced over; revelers participating in the New Orleans [[Mardi Gras]] had to wait for the parade routes to be shoveled free of snow. Concurrent with this blizzard was the extremely cold arctic air. Many city and state record low temperatures date back to this event, including all-time records for locations in the Midwest and South. State record lows: Nebraska reached {{convert|-47|F|C}}, Ohio experienced {{convert|-39|F|C}}, Louisiana bottomed out at {{convert|-16|F|C}}, and Florida dipped below zero to {{convert|-2|F|C}}.

; 1901 to 1939
*[[Great Lakes Storm of 1913]] November 7–10, 1913. “The White Hurricane” of 1913 was the deadliest and most destructive [[natural disaster]] ever to hit the [[Great Lakes Basin]] in the Midwestern United States and the Canadian province of [[Ontario]]. It produced {{convert|90|mph|km/h|abbr=on|}} wind gusts, [[ocean surface wave|waves]] over {{convert|35|ft|m|abbr=on|}} high, and [[whiteout (weather)|whiteout]] [[snowsquall]]s. It killed more than 250 people, destroyed 19 ships, and stranded 19 others. Perhaps the most well-known ship to go down in a November gale was the [[SS Edmund Fitzgerald|SS ''Edmund Fitzgerald'']] in 1975.

*[[Armistice Day Blizzard|Armistice Day Blizzard of 1940]] November 10–12, 1940. Took place in the Midwest region of the United States on [[Armistice Day]]. This "[[Panhandle hook]]" winter storm cut a {{convert|1000|mi|km|abbr=on|adj=mid|-wide path}} through the middle of the country from [[Kansas]] to [[Michigan]]. The morning of the storm was unseasonably warm but by mid afternoon conditions quickly deteriorated into a raging blizzard that would last into the next day. A total of 145 deaths were blamed on the storm, almost a third of them duck hunters who had taken time off to take advantage of the ideal hunting conditions. Weather forecasters had not predicted the severity of the oncoming storm, and as a result the hunters were not dressed for cold weather. When the storm began many hunters took shelter on small islands in the Mississippi River, and the {{convert|50|mph|km/h|abbr=on}} winds and {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=on}} waves overcame their encampments. Some became stranded on the islands and then froze to death in the single-digit temperatures that moved in over night. Others tried to make it to shore and drowned.
*[[North American blizzard of 1947]] December 25–26, 1947. Was a record-breaking snowfall that began on Christmas Day and brought the Northeast United States to a standstill. Central Park in New York City got 26" of snowfall in 24 hours with deeper snows in suburbs. It was not accompanied by high winds, but the snow fell steadily with drifts reaching {{convert|10|ft|m|abbr=on}}. Seventy-seven deaths were attributed to the blizzard.&lt;ref name="The American Weather Book pg 265"/&gt;
* The Blizzard of 1949 - The first blizzard started on Sunday, January 2, 1949; it lasted for three days. It was followed by two more months of blizzard after blizzard with high winds and bitter cold. Deep drifts isolated southeast Wyoming, northern Colorado, western South Dakota and western Nebraska, for weeks. Railroad tracks and roads were all drifted in with drifts of 20 feet and more.  Hundreds of people that had been traveling on trains were stranded.  Motorists that had set out on January 2 found their way to private farm homes in rural areas and hotels and other buildings in towns; some dwellings were so crowded that there wasn't enough room for all to sleep at once.  It would be weeks before they were plowed out. The Federal government quickly responded with aid, airlifting food and hay for livestock.  The total rescue effort involved numerous volunteers and local agencies plus at least ten major state and federal agencies from the U.S. Army to the National Park Service. Private businesses, including railroad and oil companies, also lent manpower and heavy equipment to the work of plowing out. The official death toll was 76 people and one million livestock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/video/2365629270/|title=Blizzard of '49 - Wyoming History|publisher=|accessdate=11 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hein|first1=Rebecca|title=The Notorious Blizzard of 1949|url=https://www.wyohistory.org/encyclopedia/notorious-blizzard-1949|website=The Wyoming State Historical Society|accessdate=December 20, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brechfa Forest West Wind Farm''' is a wind farm in [[Brechfa Forest]] in [[Carmarthenshire]] in south west [[Wales]]. Construction of the wind farm began in November 2016 and power generation commenced in January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/first-electricity-new-west-wales-14177523|title=The first electricity from new West Wales wind farm has started being produced|last=Lewis|first=Ian|date=2018-01-19|work=walesonline|access-date=2018-08-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Planning==
Innogy Renewables UK Ltd. proposed that the wind farm would be built in Strategic Search Area G, created as part of the Welsh Government's TAN 8&lt;ref&gt;[http://wales.gov.uk/topics/planning/policy/tans/tan8/?lang=en WG TAN 8 website]&lt;/ref&gt; policy, published in 2005. Brechfa Forest West Wind Farm, had a proposed capacity of greater than 50 MW; thus the application was submitted to the [[Infrastructure Planning Commission]]. 

The Brechfa Forest West development, located near the Afon Pib valley, consists of 28 turbines with a maximum tip height of 145 metres. The turbines have a generating capacity of around 57.4 MW.  The plans were opposed by local activists.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.turbineaction.co.uk/Brechfa%20forest.htm Turbineaction.co.uk website]&lt;/ref&gt;

As the Infrastructure Planning Commission ceased to exist in April 2012, the Brechfa Forest West application fell to the National Infrastructure Planning section of the [[Planning Inspectorate]] to produce a recommendation for the Secretary of State at DECC. They recommended approval, and [[Department of Energy and Climate Change|DECC]] confirmed that development consent for Brechfa Forest West was granted on 12 March 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://infrastructure.planningportal.gov.uk/projects/wales/brechfa-forest-west-wind-farm/ NIPS website]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''CSG Standard''' is a [[voluntary carbon market]] certification [[technical standard|standard]], which describes the principles, processes and rules for the issuance of CSG Standard [[carbon credits]]. The CSG Standard is designed to finance small-scale [[climate protection projects]], allowing voluntary carbon market participants to support local initiatives by purchasing carbon credits.

== Voluntary carbon market certification standards ==
Voluntary carbon market certification standards, also known as carbon offset schemes, define the rules of verification, measurement, tracking and monitoring of [[greenhouse gas emission units]] (so-called carbon credits) generated by climate protection projects . Several such standards exist. Projects running under voluntary carbon market certification standards (e.g. Verified Carbon Standard, Gold Standard, Social Carbon, VER+, The Voluntary Offset Standard) currently in use around the world must meet three additionality criteria:

• Legal additionality: a project cannot meet this criterion if it is only realised in order to comply with legal requirements. However, it must comply with all relevant standards and legislation;

• Environmental additionality: a project may not cause large-scale negative impact on the environment;

• Financial additionality: a project may only be implemented if it could not be realised without the profits made through selling carbon credits. (https://web.archive.org/web/20150706102935/http://www.wwf.org.uk/filelibrary/pdf/carbon_offset_long.pdf )

==Basic principles==
* Sustainability: a project must contribute to sustainable development. This means that project owners need to demonstrate that their project has positive socio-economic impacts, and improves the lives of local people.
* Completeness: a project should take into account all relevant changes in GHG emissions, as well as carbon sequestration. The project must comply with both domestic and international regulations in force. Project developers are required to declare that their project is fully compliant. The project must also comply with all the requirements under this standard.
* Credibility: both the reduction of greenhouse gas emissions and carbon sequestration must be measured and verified by an independent third party during the entire crediting period.
* Transparency: fulfilling the aims of a project as well as the progress made must be monitored continuously, i.e. recorded in regular reports, and verified by an independent third party during the entire crediting period.
* Dialogue: project developers must listen to all parties directly interested, and take their opinions into account during the implementation of a project. Project developers must provide project-related information to the parties directly interested, and ensure they have the opportunity to give continuous feedback.
* Local support: the CSG Standard is designed to [[support local projects]] that generate carbon credits for local people and companies. This has to be taken into account as a fundamental principle in the evaluation of each project.

== Verification process ==
Depending on the type of a particular climate protection project, a Project Design Document (PDD) is prepared either based on existing methodology or after developing new methodology, which is then submitted to the Technical Advisory Panel (TAP), consisting of external experts, for approval. The Project Design Document includes a detailed description of both the technical and business plan for a project, the methodology used, monitoring procedures and the expected environmental impacts of the project. Following the third-party verification of the project, carbon credits may be issued through carbonregistry.com, an online registration system for the administration of various carbon credit transactions. Carbon credits sold through the system will be used by buyers to offset their emissions, and at the same time credits are “retired”, i.e. withdrawn from circulation.

== Carbon footprinting, verification and Carbon Trust standard  ==

=== Carbon Trust standards ===

The Carbon Trust runs a series of environmental standards that certify measurement and reduction.  Currently these cover carbon, water and waste and have been awarded to hundreds of leading companies and organisations across the world.

In June 2008 the Carbon Trust introduced the Carbon Trust Carbon Standard to address what it describes as business [[greenwash]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/24/carbonemissions.carbonfootprints|title=Carbon Trust aims to end 'greenwash' by launching company standard | publisher =The Guardian|date=24 June 2008|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Carbon Trust Carbon Standard is only awarded to companies and organisations who measure and reduce their carbon emissions year on year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/7469083.stm|title=Carbon standard 'to renew trust' | publisher =BBC|date=24 June 2008|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Examples of organisations who have held the Carbon Standard include [[Sky plc|Sky]], [[Aldi]], [[Eurotunnel]], [[Bupa]], [[Pricewaterhousecoopers]], [[Samsung Electronics]], [[Angus Council]], [[Capital &amp; Regional]], [[Telefonica Europe|O2]], [[RWE npower]], [[Credit Suisse]], [[Scottish Government]] and the UK [[Department of Energy and Climate Change|DECC]].

In February 2013 the Carbon Trust introduced the Carbon Trust Water Standard to recognise those companies reducing their water use year on year.  The first four companies to receive the Water Standard were [[Sainsbury's]], [[Coca-Cola]] Enterprises Ltd, Sunlight Services Group, and Branston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbontrust.com/about-us/press/2013/02/carbon-trust-urges-business-to-wake-up-to-water-waste|title=Carbon Trust urges business to wake up to water waste| publisher =The Carbon Trust|date=9 February 2013|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2013 the Carbon Trust introuduced the Carbon Trust Waste Standard.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbontrust.com/about-us/press/2013/07/carbon-trust-to-take-on-waste|title=Carbon Trust to take on waste| publisher =The Carbon Trust|date=3 July 2013|accessdate=6 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2013 the waste standard was awarded to the first wave of organisations, which included [[the Football Association]], [[Renishaw plc]], [[Whitbread]], [[Pricewaterhousecoopers]] and [[AkzoNobel]] Decorative Paints. These last three became the first in the world to gain the triple crown of reaching the carbon, water and waste standard.

In 2015 the Carbon Trust launched the Carbon Trust Supply Chain Standard to look at carbon footprints across the supply chain. It is the world’s first independent certification for organisations that are measuring, managing and reducing greenhouse gas (CO2e) emissions in their supply chains.

In 2016 the Carbon Trust launched the Carbon Trust Zero Waste to Landfill Standard.

===Carbon footprint label===
The Carbon Trust helps companies to measure the carbon emissions associated with their products (embodied emissions) and also provides a label for these products [[carbon footprint]]. Measuring the embodied emissions of products enables reductions to be identified and achieved across the supply chain. The label demonstrates a commitment by the product owner to reduce that footprint every two years. The [[carbon emission label|Carbon Reduction Label]] was introduced in March 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-11523660|title=UK carbon label goods sales 'pass £2bn-a-year mark'| publisher =BBC|date=13 October 2010|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Examples of products that have featured their carbon footprint are [[Kingsmill (bread)|Kingsmill]] bread, [[Quorn]] foods, [[Evian]] water, [[British Sugar|Silver Spoon]] sugar, [[Walkers (snack foods)|Walkers]] crisps, a range of own brand products in [[Tesco]] supermarkets, Halifax ([[HBOS]]) bank accounts, [[Dyson (company)|Dyson]] airblades, [[Marshalls]] building products, [[Quaker oats]], [[Lafarge (company)|Lafarge]] cement,  and [[Pompeian (olive oil)|Pompeian]] Olive Oil.

The standards behind carbon labelling are now formally recognised through the PAS 2050 developed by the Carbon Trust in conjunction with [[British Standards Institution|BSI]] and [[Defra]].  This methodology is now gaining international acceptance following its launch in October 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ukas.com/media-centre/press-releases/First_Accreditation_for_Product_Greenhouse_Gas.asp|title=UKAS Awards First Accreditation for Product Greenhouse Gas Assessment|publisher=United Kingdom Accreditation Service|date=7 June 2010|accessdate=18 March 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130216052333/http://www.ukas.com/media-centre/press-releases/First_Accreditation_for_Product_Greenhouse_Gas.asp#|archive-date=16 February 2013|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Funds and financing==

The Carbon Trust also supports the development and deployment of low carbon technologies and is actively engaged in the [[fuel cell]], [[wave energy]], [[wind energy]], [[solar energy]], [[biomass]] and [[biofuels]] sectors. It has a particularly active role in the Offshore Wind sector through its Offshore Wind Accelerator programme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.carbontrust.com/our-clients/o/offshore-wind-accelerator|title=Offshore Wind Accelerator| publisher =The Carbon Trust|accessdate=18 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In April 2016 it launched its Green Business Fund offering a range of services for [[Small and medium-sized enterprises|SMEs]] in [[Great Britain]] including up to £5,000 capital contribution towards buying energy efficient equipment. It is also involved in other finance schemes including interest-free loans for [[small business|small and medium-sized enterprises]] available for energy-efficient equipment in [[Wales]].

'''Chlorine trifluoride''' is an [[Interhalogen|interhalogen compound]] with the formula ClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. This colorless, poisonous, corrosive, and extremely reactive [[gas]] condenses to a pale-greenish yellow liquid, the form in which it is most often sold (pressurized at room temperature). The compound is primarily of interest as a component in [[rocket fuel]]s, in plasmaless cleaning and [[etching]] operations in the [[semiconductor industry]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

==Preparation, structure, and properties==
It was first reported in 1930 by Ruff and Krug who prepared it by [[halogenation|fluorination]] of [[chlorine]]; this also produced [[Chlorine monofluoride|ClF]] and the mixture was separated by distillation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

:3 F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + Cl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; → 2 ClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;
ClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is approximately [[T-shaped (chemistry)|T-shaped]], with one short bond (1.598&amp;nbsp;[[Ångström|Å]]) and two long bonds (1.698&amp;nbsp;Å).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | volume = 21 | issue = 4| pages = 609–614 | journal = The Journal of Chemical Physics | first1 = D.

The elongated Cl-F axial bonds are consistent with [[hypervalent bonding]].

Pure ClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is stable to 180&amp;nbsp;°C in quartz vessels; above this temperature it decomposes by a [[Radical (chemistry)|free radical]] mechanism to its constituent elements.&lt;!--Doesn't ClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; attack quartz?--&gt;{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Reactions==
Reactions with many metals give [[chloride]]s and [[fluoride]]s; [[phosphorus]] yields [[phosphorus trichloride]] (PCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[phosphorus pentafluoride]] (PF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;); and [[sulfur]] yields [[sulfur dichloride]] (SCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[sulfur tetrafluoride]] (SF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;). ClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; also violently reacts with water, oxidizing it to give oxygen or, in controlled quantities, [[oxygen difluoride]] (OF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), as well as [[hydrogen fluoride]] and [[hydrogen chloride]]:

:ClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + 2H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;nowiki&gt;→&lt;/nowiki&gt; 3HF + HCl + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

:ClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O &lt;nowiki&gt;→&lt;/nowiki&gt; HF + HCl + OF&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

It will also convert many metal oxides to metal halides and oxygen or oxygen difluoride.

One of the main uses of ClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is to produce [[uranium hexafluoride]], UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;, as part of nuclear fuel processing and reprocessing, by the fluorination of uranium metal:

:U + 3 ClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → UF&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt; + 3 ClF

The compound can also dissociate under the scheme:

:ClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → ClF + F&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==Uses==

===Semiconductor industry===
In the semiconductor industry, chlorine trifluoride is used to clean [[chemical vapour deposition]] chambers.&lt;ref name=SIcvd /&gt; It has the advantage that it can be used to remove semiconductor material from the chamber walls without the need to dismantle the chamber.&lt;ref name=SIcvd /&gt; Unlike most of the alternative chemicals used in this role, it does not need to be activated by the use of plasma since the heat of the chamber is enough to make it decompose and react with the semiconductor material.&lt;ref name=SIcvd&gt;{{cite news |title=In Situ Cleaning of CVD Chambers |newspaper=Semiconductor International |date=June 1, 1999 |url=http://www.semiconductor.net/article/209105-In_Situ_Cleaning_of_CVD_Chambers.php }}{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rocket propellant===
Chlorine trifluoride has been investigated as a high-performance storable oxidizer in [[rocket propellant]] systems and it may be used as such someday. Handling concerns, however, severely limit its use. [[John Drury Clark]] summarized the difficulties:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It is, of course, extremely toxic, but that's the least of the problem. It is [[Hypergolic propellant|hypergolic]] with every known fuel, and so rapidly hypergolic that no ignition delay has ever been measured. It is also hypergolic with such things as cloth, wood, and test engineers, not to mention asbestos, sand, and water—with which it reacts explosively. It can be kept in some of the ordinary structural metals—steel, copper, aluminum, etc.—because of the formation of a thin film of insoluble metal fluoride that protects the bulk of the metal, just as the invisible coat of oxide on aluminum keeps it from burning up in the atmosphere. If, however, this coat is melted or scrubbed off, and has no chance to reform, the operator is confronted with the problem of coping with a metal-fluorine fire. For dealing with this situation, I have always recommended a good pair of running shoes.&lt;ref name= "CLFazine" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Clark, John D. | title=Ignition! | publisher=UMI Books on Demand | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-8135-0725-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ignition"&gt;{{Cite book | last = Clark | first = John D. | authorlink = John Drury Clark | title = Ignition! An Informal History of Liquid Rocket Propellants | publisher = Rutgers University Press | year = 1972 | pages = 214 | isbn = 978-0-8135-0725-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Proposed military applications===
Under the [[code name]] '''N-Stoff''' ("substance N"), chlorine trifluoride was investigated for military applications by the [[Kaiser Wilhelm Institute]] in [[Nazi Germany]] not long before the start of [[World War II]]. Tests were made against mock-ups of the [[Maginot Line]] fortifications, and it was found to be an effective combined [[incendiary weapon]] and [[chemical warfare|poison gas]]. From 1938, construction commenced on a partly [[bunker]]ed, partly subterranean 31.76&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; munitions factory, the [[Falkenhagen Bunker|Falkenhagen industrial complex]], which was intended to produce 90 [[tonne]]s of N-Stoff per month, plus [[sarin]]. However, by the time it was captured by the advancing [[Red Army]] in 1945, the factory had produced only about 30 to 50 tonnes, at a cost of over 100 [[German reichsmark|German Reichsmark]] per kilogram{{ref|a|a}}. N-Stoff was never used in war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bunkertours.co.uk/germany_2004.htm|title=Germany 2004|website=www.bunkertours.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hazards==
ClF&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; is a very strong [[Oxidizing agent|oxidizing]] and [[fluorination|fluorinating]] agent. It is extremely reactive with most inorganic and organic materials, such as glass, and will initiate the combustion of many otherwise non-flammable materials [[hypergolic propellant|without any ignition source]]. These reactions are often violent, and in some cases [[explosion|explosive]]. Vessels made from [[steel]], [[copper]], or [[nickel]] resist the attack of the material due to formation of a thin layer of insoluble metal fluoride, but [[molybdenum]], [[tungsten]], and [[titanium]] form volatile fluorides and are consequently unsuitable. Any equipment that comes into contact with chlorine trifluoride must be scrupulously cleaned and then [[Passivation (chemistry)|passivated]], because any contamination left may burn through the passivation layer faster than it can re-form. Chlorine trifluoride has also been known to corrode materials otherwise known to be non-corrodible such as [[iridium]], [[platinum]], and [[gold]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2018}}

The power to surpass the oxidizing ability of oxygen leads to corrosivity against oxide-containing materials often thought as incombustible. Chlorine trifluoride and gases like it have been reported to ignite sand, [[asbestos]], and other highly fire-retardant materials. It will also ignite the ashes of materials that have already been burned in oxygen. In an industrial accident, a spill of 900&amp;nbsp;kg of chlorine trifluoride burned through 30&amp;nbsp;cm of concrete and 90&amp;nbsp;cm of gravel beneath.&lt;ref&gt;Air Products Safetygram, https://web.archive.org/web/20060318221608/http://www.airproducts.com/nr/rdonlyres/8479ed55-2170-4651-a3d4-223b2957a9f3/0/safetygram39.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ignition"/&gt; Other than the use of nitrogen and noble gases, no known fire control/suppression methods are capable of suppressing this oxidation, so the surrounding area must be flooded with nitrogen or helium or simply kept cool until the reaction ceases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/cgi-bin/GetTRDoc?AD=AD0266121 |title=Chlorine Trifluoride Handling Manual |date=September 1961 |publisher=Rocketdyne |location=Canoga Park, CA |page=24|accessdate=2012-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; The compound reacts with water-based suppressors, and oxidizes even in the absence of atmospheric oxygen, rendering traditional atmosphere-displacement suppressors such as CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [[halomethane|halon]] ineffective. It ignites glass on contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Exposure to larger amounts of chlorine trifluoride, as a liquid or as a gas, ignites living tissue. The hydrolysis reaction with water is violent and exposure results in a thermal burn. The products of hydrolysis are mainly [[hydrofluoric acid]] and [[hydrochloric acid]], usually released as acidic steam or vapor due to the highly exothermic nature of the reaction. Hydrofluoric acid is corrosive to human tissue, is absorbed through skin, selectively attacks bone, interferes with nerve function, and causes often-fatal fluorine poisoning. Although [[hydrochloric acid]] is much less toxic to humans, it is often more corrosive than hydrofluoric acid.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

For the full nonlinear theory, less is known.  Several difficulties arise when interactions of mixed symmetry fields are considered, but at least in situations involving an infinite number of such fields (notably string theory) these difficulties are not insurmountable.  

==Overview==
In four [[spacetime]] [[dimension]]s, the field is not dual to the graviton, if massless, but it can be used to describe ''massive'', pure [[spin (physics)|spin]] 2 [[quantum|quanta]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Curtright | first1 = T. L. | last2 = Freund | first2 = P. G. O. | doi = 10.1016/0550-3213(80)90174-1 | title = Massive dual fields | journal = Nuclear Physics B | volume = 172 | pages = 413 | year = 1980 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1980NuPhB.172..413C }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar descriptions exist for other massive higher spins, in ''D''≥4.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = González | first1 = B. | last2 = Khoudeir | first2 = A. | last3 = Montemayor | first3 = R. | last4 = Urrutia | first4 = L. F. | title = Duality for massive spin two theories in arbitrary dimensions | doi = 10.1088/1126-6708/2008/09/058 | journal = Journal of High Energy Physics | volume = 2008 | issue = 9 | pages = 058 | year = 2008 | pmid =  | pmc = |arxiv = 0806.3200 |bibcode = 2008JHEP...09..058G }}&lt;/ref&gt;  

The simplest example of the linearized theory is given by a rank three Lorentz tensor &lt;math&gt;T_{\alpha\beta\mu}&lt;/math&gt; whose indices carry the permutation symmetry of the [[Young diagram]] corresponding to the [[integer partition]] 3=2+1.  That is to say, &lt;math&gt;T_{\alpha\beta\mu}=T_{[\alpha\beta]\mu}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T_{[\alpha\beta\mu]}=0&lt;/math&gt; where indices in square brackets are totally antisymmetrized.  The corresponding field strength for &lt;math&gt;T_{\alpha\beta\mu}&lt;/math&gt; is
&lt;math&gt; F_{\alpha\beta\gamma\mu}=3\partial_{[\gamma}T_{\alpha\beta]\mu}.&lt;/math&gt;  This has a nontrivial trace &lt;math&gt; F_{\alpha\beta}=\eta^{\gamma\mu}F_{\alpha\beta\gamma\mu}&lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\eta^{\gamma\mu}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[Minkowski metric]] with signature &lt;tt&gt;(+,&amp;minus;,&amp;minus;,...)&lt;/tt&gt;.

The action for &lt;math&gt;T_{\alpha\beta\mu}&lt;/math&gt; in ''D'' spacetime dimensions is bilinear in the field strength and its trace.
:&lt;math&gt; S=\frac{-1}{6} \int d^{D}x (F_{\alpha\beta\gamma\mu}F^{\alpha\beta\gamma\mu}-3F_{\alpha\beta}F^{\alpha\beta}).&lt;/math&gt;
This action is gauge invariant, assuming there is zero net contribution from any boundaries, while the field strength itself is not.  The gauge transformation in question is given by
:&lt;math&gt; \delta T_{\alpha\beta\mu}=\partial_{[\alpha}S_{\beta]\mu}+\partial_{[\alpha}A_{\beta]\mu}-\partial_{\mu}A_{\alpha\beta}&lt;/math&gt;
where ''S'' and ''A'' are arbitrary symmetric and antisymmetric tensors, respectively.

An infinite family of mixed symmetry [[gauge field]]s arises, formally, in the zero tension limit of [[string theory]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Curtright | first1 = T. L. | last2 = Thorn | first2 = C. B. | doi = 10.1016/0550-3213(86)90525-0 | title = Symmetry patterns in the mass spectra of dual string models | journal = Nuclear Physics B | volume = 274 | issue = 3–4 | pages = 520 | year = 1986 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 1986NuPhB.274..520C }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially if ''D''&gt;4.  Such mixed symmetry fields can also be used to provide alternate local descriptions for [[massive particle]]s, either in the context of strings with nonzero tension, or else for individual particle quanta without reference to string theory.

The '''data furnace''' is a proposed method&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Data Furnace: Heating Up with Cloud Computing|url=http://research.microsoft.com/pubs/150265/heating.pdf|publisher=Microsoft Research|author1=Jie Liu |author2=Michel Goraczko |author3=Sean James |author4=Christian Belady |author5=Jiakang Lu |author6=Kamin Whitehouse |accessdate=30 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; of [[heating]] residential homes or offices by running [[Computer|computers]] in them, which release considerable amounts of [[waste heat]]. Data furnaces can theoretically be cheaper than storing computers in huge [[data centers]] because the higher cost of electricity in residential areas (when compared to industrial zones) can be offset by charging the home owner for the heat that the data center gives off. Some large companies that store and process thousands of [[gigabyte]]s of data believe that data furnaces could be cheaper because there would be little to no [[overhead cost]]s. The cost of a traditional data storage center is up to around $400 per server,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data furnaces could bring heat to homes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/business/data-furnaces-could-bring-heat-to-homes.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas the overhead cost per server of a home data furnace is around $10. Individuals had already begun using computers as a heat source by 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data furnaces could bring heat to homes|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/business/data-furnaces-could-bring-heat-to-homes.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usefulness==
The first kind of data furnace (DF) could be a low cost seasonal DF. This kind of DF would use an existing [[broadband]] connection to perform delay-tolerant jobs such as content [[web indexing|indexing]] or the processing of large sets of scientific data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Turn On the Server. It’s Cold Inside.|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/11/27/business/data-furnaces-could-bring-heat-to-homes.html|publisher=New York Times|accessdate=30 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The server will only come on and start heating and processing when the house needs heat. The second kind of DF would be the low bandwidth neighborhood DF. This option can provide faster computations as it can run at all times, but this increases the risk of overheating. To get around this problem there may be vents to the outside added to the server racks to get rid of some of the unneeded heat. The third option would be an eco-friendly urban DF. This option, much like the second, runs year round and can vent excess heat to the outside. This would be an advantage for service providers to expand into urban areas more quickly, so long as the [[Application software|application]]s scale to the number of servers. This option causes a new challenge, because since it runs year round, the cost of electricity to run the servers cannot be offset by billing the home owners for the [[heat]] that they use as it will be little to none.

== Technical requirements ==
For a data furnace heating water, the heating needs to be at least 56°C/ 133°F to prevent the development of pathogens while limiting the risks of skin. Regarding space heating radiators, a temperature of 50-60°C/122-140°F is suitable for a radiator embedding processors as long as the heating surface is of significant size to dissipate the heat.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pulley|first=Adam|date=28 January 2015|title=How Hot Does A Data Furnace Heating System Need To Be?|url=http://greenprocessing.tech/resources/How%20hot%20does%20a%20data%20furnace%20heating%20system%20need%20to%20be.pdf|journal=Green Processing|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Security==
There are concerns about the security of these servers, as they would be stored on private properties, unmonitored. Unlike traditional data centers that are constantly monitored, data furnaces should be treated as the most insecure environment for data storage. For the best security, each server would have a device to prevent tampering. Furthermore, all of the data on these servers would have to be [[encrypted]] so that no one except the person requesting the data would have access to it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Worried About Being Cold this Winter?

== Applications ==
A few companies around the world are commercialising this concept around the world.

'''ENTSO-E''', the '''European Network of Transmission System Operators''', represents 43 electricity [[transmission system operator]]s (TSOs) from 36 countries across Europe, thus extending beyond EU borders. ENTSO-E was established and given legal mandates by the [[Third Energy Package|EU’s Third Package]] for the Internal Energy Market in 2009, which aims at further liberalising the gas and electricity markets in the EU.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite web|title = Who Is ENTSO-E?|url = https://www.entsoe.eu/about-entso-e/Pages/default.aspx|website = Entsoe.eu|accessdate = 2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
On 27 June 2008, 36&amp;nbsp;European electricity [[transmission system operator]]s (TSOs) signed in [[Prague]] a declaration of intent to create the ENTSO-E.&lt;ref name="entsoe010708"&gt;{{Cite press release

&lt;/ref&gt; ENTSO-E became operational on 1 July 2009. The former associations ETSO, ATSOI, UKTSOA, NORDEL, UCTE and BALTSO became a part of the ENTSO-E, while still offering data by their predecessors for public interest.&lt;ref name="entsoe010709"&gt;{{Cite press release

Creation of ENTSO-E was initiated by the adoption of the European Union [[Third Energy Package|third legislative package on the gas and electricity markets]].&lt;ref name="entsoe010708" /&gt; In 2003, the [[European Commission]] conducted a sector inquiry concerning the competition of [[electricity market]] in six European countries.&lt;ref name="inquiry"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; Examining competition in these countries, the final report stated serious issues to be solved.&lt;ref name="final"&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt; It was noticed that the integration between member state's markets is still insufficient. Additionally, the absence of transparently available market information was assessed.&lt;ref name="inquiry" /&gt; As a result, the third legislative package on the EU gas and electricity markets was adopted by the European Commission in September 2007.&lt;ref name="third"&gt;{{cite web

== Objectives ==
According to its website, "ENTSO-E promotes closer cooperation across Europe’s [[Transmission system operator|TSOs]] to support the implementation of [[Energy policy of the European Union|EU energy policy]] and achieve Europe’s energy &amp; climate policy objectives, which are changing the very nature of the power system. The main objectives of ENTSO-E centre on the integration of [[renewable energy sources|renewable energy sources (RES)]] such as wind and solar power into the power system, and the completion of the internal energy market (IEM), which is central to meeting the European Union’s energy policy objectives of affordability, sustainability and security of supply. [...] ENTSO-E aims to be the focal point for all technical, market and policy issues relating to TSOs and the European network, interfacing with power system users, EU institutions, regulators and national governments."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Members ==
[[Transmission system operator|TSOs]] are responsible for the [[Electric power transmission|bulk transmission of electric power]] on the main [[High-voltage lines|high voltage]] electric networks. TSOs provide [[Electrical grid|grid]] access to the [[electricity market]] players (i.e., generating companies, traders, suppliers, distributors, and directly connected customers) according to non-discriminatory and transparent rules. In many countries, TSOs are in charge of the development of the grid infrastructure, too. TSOs in the [[European Union]] internal electricity market are entities operating independently from the other electricity market players (unbundling)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = Market legislation - Energy - European Commission|url = https://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/markets-and-consumers/market-legislation|website = Ec.europa.eu|accessdate = 2015-07-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ENTSO-E contains 43 TSOs from 36 countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.entsoe.eu/about-entso-e/inside-entso-e/member-companies/Pages/default.aspx |title=ENTSO-E Member Companies |website=Entsoe.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Geographical area ==
The geographical area covered by ENTSO-E’s member TSOs is divided into five [[Wide area synchronous grid|synchronous areas]] and two isolated systems (Cyprus and Iceland). Synchronous areas are groups of countries that are connected via their respective power systems. The system [[Utility frequency|frequency]] (50&amp;nbsp;Hz, with usually very minor deviations) is synchronous within each area, and a disturbance at one single point in the area will be registered across the entire zone. Individual synchronous areas are interconnected through [[direct current]] [[interconnector]]s.

The benefits of synchronous areas include pooling of generation capacities, common provisioning of reserves, both resulting in cost-savings, and mutual assistance in the event of disturbances, resulting in cheaper reserve power costs (for instance in case of a disturbance or outage).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|title = ENTSO-E at a Glance|url = https://www.entsoe.eu/publications/general-publications/entso-e-at-a-glance/Pages/default.aspx|website = Entsoe.eu|accessdate = 2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key activities ==

=== Pan-European Transmission Network plans and cost–benefit analysis ===
The ten-year network development plan 2016 (TYNDP)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.entsoe.eu/major-projects/ten-year-network-development-plan/ten%20year%20network%20development%20plan%202016/Pages/default.aspx |title=Ten-Year Network Development Plan 2016 |website=Entsoe.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; is drafted by ENTSO-E, in close cooperation with stakeholders, under scrutiny of [[Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators|ACER]] and is finally adopted by the [[European Commission]]. It is the only existing pan-European network development plan. It is the basis for the selection of EU projects of common interest (PCIs).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/energy/en/topics/infrastructure/projects-common-interest |title=Projects of common interest - European Commission |website=Ec.europa.eu |date=2016-11-08 |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The list of PCIs is not fixed by ENTSO-E and is subject to a different process led by the European Commission and EU Member States.

The TYNDP is updated every two years. For inclusion in the TYNDP, each project, whether transmission or storage, has to go through a cost–benefit analysis. The benefit analysis methodology&lt;ref name="entsoe2"/&gt; is developed by ENTSO-E in consultation with stakeholders and adopted by the European Commission. It assesses projects against socio-economic and environmental criteria.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Adequacy forecasts ===
ENTSO-E publishes  summer and winter generation outlooks,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.entsoe.eu/publications/system-development-reports/outlook-reports/Pages/default.aspxas ]{{dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; well as a long-term system adequacy forecast, the  Scenario Outlook &amp; Adequacy Forecast (SO&amp;AF).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.entsoe.eu/publications/system-development-reports/adequacy-forecasts/Pages/default.aspx |title=Scenario Outlook &amp; Adequacy Forecasts |website=Entsoe.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The seasonal outlooks assess if there is enough generation to cover supply and highlight possibilities for neighbouring countries to contribute to the generation/demand balance in critical situations in a specific country. The SO&amp;AF analyses system adequacy on the long-term and is connected to investment decisions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Network codes ===
ENTSO-E’s network codes are binding pan-European rules drafted by ENTSO-E in consultation with stakeholders, with guidance from [[Agency for the Cooperation of Energy Regulators|ACER]]. Network codes are grouped in three areas: 
* connection codes connecting electricity generators, demand, and direct current lines to the transmission grids; 
* operational codes governing how the pan-European electricity systems are operated; 
* and market codes facilitating and harmonising electricity trading across European borders.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Network Codes |url=http://networkcodes.entsoe.eu/category/introducing-network-codes/?p=what-are-network-codes-data |archive-url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20160107214432/http://networkcodes.entsoe.eu/category/introducing-network-codes/?p=what-are-network-codes-data |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2016-01-07 |website=Networkcodes.entsoe.eu |accessdate=2015-07-31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The drafting and adoption process of network codes is defined by the [[Third Energy Package|Third Package]]. ACER develops a framework guideline setting the policy choices for each code. On this basis, the codes are drafted by ENTSO-E in consultation with stakeholders. After ACER’s opinion and recommendation for adoption, each code is submitted to the [[European Commission]] for approval through the [[Comitology|Comitology process]], i.e., to be voted on by Member State representatives and thus to become EU law, directly binding and implemented across all Member States.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Transparency Platform (TP) ===
ENTSO-E’s Central Information Transparency Platform&lt;ref&gt;https://transparency.entsoe.eu/&lt;/ref&gt; provides free access to fundamental data and information on pan-European wholesale energy generation, transmission, and consumption.

=== Research, development, and innovation (RDI) ===
ENTSO-E’s R&amp;D Roadmap&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.entsoe.eu/publications/research-and-development-reports/rd-roadmap/Pages/default.aspx |title=R&amp;D Roadmap 2017-2026 |website=Entsoe.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; provides the ENTSO-E vision on grid projects to be carried out by [[Transmission system operator|TSOs]] to meet EU objectives. The roadmap is supported by the annual R&amp;D Implementation Plan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.entsoe.eu/publications/research-and-development-reports/rd-implementation-plan/Pages/default.aspx |title=R&amp;D Implementation Plan 2016-2018 |website=Entsoe.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; which combines both top-down and bottom-up approaches in meeting the requirements of the roadmap. ENTSO-E publishes annually a R&amp;D Monitoring Report&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.entsoe.eu/publications/research-and-development-reports/rd-monitoring-report/Pages/default.aspx |title=R&amp;D Monitoring Report 2015 |website=Entsoe.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; that assesses the progress of TSO-related R&amp;D work.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Governance ==
ENTSO-E is an international non-profit association ([[Association without lucrative purpose|AISBL]]) established according to Belgian law. ENTSO-E is financed by its members. The TSOs contribute to the budget according to the number of countries and the population served.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The highest body of ENTSO-E is the Assembly, which is composed of representatives at CEO level of all the currently 43 members. The ENTSO-E Board is elected every two years from the overall membership and through the Assembly. It includes 12 representatives. The president, vice president, and committee chairs are invited to board meetings. The board coordinates the committees and LRG work and implements Assembly decisions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = ENTSO-E Governance|url = https://www.entsoe.eu/about-entso-e/inside-entso-e/governance/Pages/default.aspx|website = Entsoe.eu|accessdate = 2015-07-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

ENTSO-E has established  four specialized committees&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.entsoe.eu/about-entso-e/inside-entso-e/entso-e-structure/working-committees/Pages/default.aspx |title=ENTSO-E Working Committees |website=Entsoe.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; composed of managers from member TSOs. Each committee leads a number of regional groups and working groups.

At the same level as the four committees, the transversal Legal &amp; Regulatory Group&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.entsoe.eu/about-entso-e/legal-and-regulatory/Pages/default.aspx |title=Legal and Regulatory Group (LRG) |website=Entsoe.eu |date= |accessdate=2016-12-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; advises all ENTSO-E bodies on legal and regulatory issues. In addition, expert groups on data, network codes implementation, and EU affairs provide specific expertise and work products to the association.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

ENTSO-E’s Secretariat is based in Brussels. It is headed by the secretary-general and represents ENTSO-E to the European institutions, regulators, and stakeholders.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="25986">'''Flow conditioning''' ensures that the “real world” environment closely resembles the “[[laboratory]]” environment for proper performance of inferential [[flow measurement|flowmeters]] like [[Gas meter|orifice]], [[gas meter|turbine]], [[gas meter|coriolis]], [[gas meter|ultrasonic]] etc.

== Types of flow ==
Basically, [[fluid dynamics|Flow]] in [[pipe (fluid conveyance)|pipe]]s can be classified as follows –
* Fully developed flow{{clarify|date=February 2014}} (found in world-class flow laboratories)
* Pseudo-fully developed flow{{clarify|date=February 2014}}
* Non-swirling, non-symmetrical flow
* Moderate swirling, non-symmetrical flow
* High swirling, symmetrical flow

== Types of flow conditioners ==
[[File:Figure (a). flow conditioner.GIF|thumb|Figure (a) showing The Flow conditioner]]
Flow conditioners shown in fig.(a) can be grouped into following three types –
* Those that eliminate swirl only (tube bundles)
* Those that eliminate swirl and non-symmetry, but do not produce pseudo fully developed flow
* Those that eliminate swirl and non-symmetry and produce pseudo fully developed flow (high-performance flow conditioners)

Straightening devices such as honeycombs and vanes inserted upstream of the flow meter can reduce the length of straight pipe required. However, they produce only marginal improvements in measurement accuracy and may still require significant length of straight pipe, which a cramped installation site may not permit.

== Natural gas measurement ==
[[Natural gas]] that carries a lot of liquids with it is known as [[wet gas]] whereas natural gas that is produced without liquid is known [[dry gas]]. Dry gas is also treated as to remove all liquids. The effect of flow conditioning for various popular meters which is used in gas measurement is explained below.

== Pipe flow conditions ==
The most important as well as most difficult to measure aspects of flow measurement are [[flow conditions]] within a pipe upstream of a meter. Flow conditions mainly refer to the [[flow velocity]] profile, irregularities in the profile, varying turbulence levels within the flow velocity or turbulence intensity profile, swirl and any other fluid flow characteristics which will cause the meter to register flow different than that expected. It will change the value from the original [[calibration]] state referred to as reference conditions that are free of installation effects.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, W. Richard, "Flow Measurement Engineering Handbook", [[McGraw-Hill]], Third Edition, 1996, {{ISBN|0-07-042366-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Installation effects ===
Installation effects such as insufficient straight pipe, exceptional pipe roughness or smoothness, elbows, [[valve]]s, tees and [[reducer]]s causes the flow conditions within the pipe to vary from the reference conditions. How these installation effects impact the meter is very important since devices which create upstream installation effects are common components of any standard metering design. Flow Conditioning refers to the process of artificially generating a reference, fully developed flow profile and is essential to enable accurate measurement while maintaining a cost-competitive meter standard design. The meter calibration factors are valid only of geometric and dynamic similarity exists between the metering and calibration conditions. In fluid mechanics, this is commonly referred to as the Law of Similarity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flowmeterdirectory.com/flowmeter_artc_04031102.html Flow conditioning for Natural gas measurement] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726164100/http://www.flowmeterdirectory.com/flowmeter_artc_04031102.html |date=2011-07-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Law of similarity ===
The principle of Law of Similarity is used extensively for theoretical and experimental fluid machines. With respect to calibration of flowmeters, the Law of Similarity is the foundation for flow measurement standards. To satisfy the Law of Similarity, the central facility concept requires geometric and dynamic similarity between the laboratory meter and the installed conditions of this same meter over the entire [[custody transfer]] period. This approach assumes that the selected technology does not exhibit any significant sensitivity to operating or mechanical variations between calibrations. The meter factor determined at the time of calibration is valid if both dynamic and geometric similarity exists between the field installation and the laboratory installation of the artifact. 
A proper manufacturer’s experimental pattern locates sensitive regions to explore, measure and empirically adjust. The manufacturer’s recommended correlation method is a rational basis for performance prediction provided the physics do not change. For instance, the physics are different between subsonic and sonic flow. To satisfy the Law of Similarity the in situ calibration concept requires geometric and dynamic similarity between the calibrated meter and the installed conditions of this same meter over the entire custody transfer period. This approach assumes that the selected technology does not exhibit any significant sensitivity to operating or mechanical variations between calibrations. The meter factor determined at the time of calibration is valid if both dynamic and geometric similarity exists in the “field meter installation” over the entire custody transfer period.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wwdmag.com/The-Effects-of-Flow-Conditioning-article6060 The effects of flow conditioning]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Velocity flow profile ===
[[File:Fig.1 Velocity flow profile.GIF|thumb|Figure (1) showing typical velocity flow profile for natural gas measurement]]The most commonly used description of flow conditions within the pipe is the flow velocity profile. Fig.(1) shows the typical flow velocity profile for natural gas measurement.&lt;ref&gt;Karnik, U., "Measurements of the Turbulence Structure Downstream of a Tubs Bundle at High Reynolds Numbers", ASME Fluids Engineering Meeting, [[Washington D.C.]], June 1993&lt;/ref&gt; The shape of the flow velocity profile is given by the following equation, &lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt;{\frac{U_y}{U_{max}}} = \left [ 1 - \frac{Y}{R} \right ]^{1/n}&lt;/math&gt;    ---- (1) &lt;br /&gt;
The value of n determines the shape of the flow velocity profile. The eq.(1) can be used to determine the flow profile's shape within the pipe by fitting a curve to experimentally measured velocity data. In 1993, the transverse flow velocities were being measured within the high pressure natural gas environment using hot wire technology to accomplish the data fit. A fully developed flow profile was used as the reference state for meter calibration and determination of [[discharge coefficient|Coefficient of Discharge]] (Cd). For [[Reynolds Number]] &lt;math&gt; 10^5 &lt;/math&gt; to &lt;math&gt; 10^6 &lt;/math&gt; n is approximately 7.5; for Re of &lt;math&gt; 10^6 &lt;/math&gt;, n is approximately 10.0 where a fully developed profile in a smooth pipe was assumed. Since n is a function of Reynolds Number and [[fanning friction factor|friction factor]], more accurate values of n can be estimated by using the eq.(2),
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt; n = \frac {1}{\sqrt{f}}.&lt;/math&gt;    ---- (2) &lt;br /&gt;
Where, f is friction factor.&lt;ref&gt;Colebrook, C.F., 'turbulent Flow in Pipes, with Particular reference to the Transition between the Smooth and Rough Pipe Laws", J. Inst Clv. Eng., vol. 11, pp. 133-136, 1938-1939&lt;/ref&gt; A good estimate of a fully developed velocity profile can be used for those without adequate equipment to actually measure the flow velocities within the pipe. The following straight pipe equivalent length in eq.(3) was utilized to ensure a fully developed flow profile exists.&lt;ref&gt;White M. Frank, "Fluids Mechanics", Second Edition, McGraw-Hill, 1986, {{ISBN|0-07-069673-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt; Pipe Diameters = 4.4D \left [R_e \right ]^{1/6}&lt;/math&gt;    ---- (3) &lt;br /&gt;
In eq.(3) the pipe lengths required is significant, hence we need some devices that can able to condition the flow over a shorter pipe length allowing metering packages to be cost competitive and accurate. Here the velocity flow profile is generally three-dimensional. Normally the description requires no axial orientation indication if the profile is asymmetric and if it does exists, then axial orientation with respect to some suitable plane of reference is required. Asymmetry exists downstream of installation effects such as elbows or tees. Usually, the velocity flow profile is described on two planes 90° apart. Using the latest software technology a full pipe cross sectional description of the velocity profile is possible provided sufficient data points are given.

=== Turbulence intensity ===
The second description of the flow field state within the pipe is the turbulence intensity. According to an experiment in 1994, the metering errors may exist even when the velocity flow profile is fully developed with perfect pipe flow conditions. Conversely, it was found zero metering [[error]] at times when the velocity profile was not fully developed. Hence this behavior was referred to the turbulence intensity of the gas flow that can cause metering bias error. This behavior accounts in part for the less than adequate performance of the conventional tube bundle.&lt;ref&gt;Kamlk U., Jungowskl W.M., Botros -K., "Effect of Turbulence on Orifice Meter Performance", 11'" International Symposium and Exhibition on Offshore Mechanics and Arctic Engineering, ASME, May 1994, Vol. 116&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Swirl ===

The third description of the flow field's state is swirl. Swirl is the tangential flow component of the velocity vector. The velocity profile should be referred to as the axial velocity profile. As the velocity vector can be resolved into three mutually orthogonal components, the velocity profile only represents the axial component of velocity. fig.(2) showing the Swirl Angle which explains the definition of flow swirl and swirl angle. Note that swirl is usually referenced to full body rotation (that which the full pipeline flow follows one axis of swirl). In real pipeline conditions, such as downstream of elbows two or more mechanisms of swirl may be present.

== Effects on flow measurement devices ==
The condition of a flow can affect the performance and accuracy of devices that measure the flow.

=== Effects of flow conditioning on Orifice meter ===
The basic orifice mass flow equation provided by API 14.3 and ISO 5167 is given as,
&lt;br/ &gt;&lt;math&gt; q_m = (C_d)(E_v)(Y)\left [ \frac{\pi}{4} \right ](d)^2 \sqrt {2 \rho \Delta P} &lt;/math&gt;    ----(4)
&lt;br/ &gt;Where, 
&lt;math&gt; q_m  &lt;/math&gt; = Mass flow &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; C_d &lt;/math&gt; = Coefficient of discharge &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; E_v &lt;/math&gt; = Velocity of approach factor &lt;br /&gt;
Y = Expansion factor &lt;br /&gt;
d = orifice diameter &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \rho &lt;/math&gt; = density of the fluid &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \Delta P &lt;/math&gt; = differential pressure &lt;br /&gt;
Now to use the eq.(4), the flow field entering the [[orifice plate]] must be free of swirl and exhibit a fully developed flow profile. API 14.3 (1990) and [[International Organization for Standardization|ISO standards]] determined the Coefficient of Discharge by completing numerous calibration tests where the indicated mass flow was compared to the actual mass flow to determine coefficient of discharge. In all testing the common requirement was a fully developed flow profile entering the orifice plate.&lt;ref&gt;Scott L.J., Brennan J. A., Blakeslee, NIST, U.S. Department of Commerce, National Institute of Standards and Technology, "NIST DataBase 45 GRI/KIST Orifice Meter Discharge Ceoffcient", Version 1.0 N1ST Standard Reference Data Program, Gaithersberg, MD (1994)&lt;/ref&gt; Accurate standard compliant meter designs must therefore ensure that a swirl free, fully developed flow profile is impinging on the orifice plate. There are numerous methods available to accomplish this. These methods are commonly known as “flow conditioning”.
The first installation option is to revert to no flow conditioning, but adequate pipe lengths must be provided by the eq.(2) mentioned above. This generally makes the manufacturing costs for a flow measurement facility unrealistic due to excessively long meter tubes; Imagine meter tubes 75 diameters long.
The second and most well known option is the 19-tube tube-bundle flow conditioner. The majority of flow installations in [[North America]] contain the tube bundle. With the help of hot wire, [[pitot tube]] and [[laser]]-based computerized measurement systems which allow detailed measurement of velocity profile and turbulence intensity; we know that the tube bundle does not provide fully developed flow.&lt;ref&gt;Kamlk, U., "A compact Orifice Meter/Flow Conditioner Package", 3rd international Symposium of Fluid Flow Measurement, San Antonio, Texas., March, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, this device is causing biased orifice flow measurement. As a result of these recent findings, few tube bundles are specified for flow measurement and reduce the use of such device. Numerous references are available providing performance results indicating less than acceptable meter performance when using the conventional 19-tube test bundle.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow, T.B., 'Orifice Meter Installation effects in the GRl MRF", 3rd International Symposium of Fluid Flow Measurement, San Antonio Tx., March, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; The individual results should be reviewed to ascertain details such as beta ratio, meter tube lengths, Re and test conditions. [[File:Conventional tube bundle performance.GIF|thumb|Figure (3) showing Conventional tube bundle performance]]
The general indications are that the conventional tube bundle will cause the orifice installation to over register flow values up to 1.5% when the tube bundle is 1 pipe diameter to approximately 11 pipe diameters from the orifice plate. This is caused by a flat velocity profile that creates higher differential pressures than with a fully developed profile. There is a crossover region from approximately 10 to 15 pipe diameters where the error band is approximately zero. Then a slight under-registration of flows occurs for distances between approximately 15 to 25 pipe diameters. This is due to a peaked velocity profile that creates lower differential pressures than a fully developed profile. At distances greater than 25 pipe diameters the error asymptotes to zero. Fig.(3) showing the Conventional Tube Bundle Performance explaining typical characteristic behavior of the popular 19 tube, tube-bundle. An additional drawback of the conventional 19 tube, tube bundle is variation in sizing.
The conventional tube bundle provides errors very much dependent on installation details, that is, the elbows on and out of plane, tees, valves and distances from the last pipe installation to the conditioner and conditioner to the orifice plate. These errors have a great significance. Therefore, the latest findings regarding conventional tube bundle performance should be reviewed prior to meter station design and installation.
The final installation option for orifice metering is perforated plate flow conditioners. There is a variety of perforated plates have entered the market. These devices generally are designed to rectify the drawbacks of the conventional tube bundle ([[accuracy and precision|accuracy]] and [[repeatability]] insufficiency). The reader is cautioned to review the performance of the chosen perforated plate carefully prior to installation. A flow conditioner performance test guideline should be utilized to determine performance.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow T. B., Metering Research Facility Program, " Orifice Meter Installations Effects, Development of a Flow Conditioner Performance Test', GRI-9710207. Dec. 1997.&lt;/ref&gt; The key elements of a flow conditioner test are -
# Perform a baseline calibration test with an upstream length of 70 to 100 pipe diameters of straight meter tube. The baseline Coefficient of Discharge values should be within the 95% confidence interval for the RG orifice equation (i.e. the coefficient of discharge equation as provided by AGA-3).
# Select values of upstream meter tube length, and flow conditioner location, to be used for the performance evaluation. Install the flow conditioner at the desired location. First, perform a test for either the two 90° elbows out-of-plane installation, or the high swirl installation for &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; = 0.40 and for &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; = 0.67. This test will show whether the flow conditioner removes swirl from the disturbed flow. If the &lt;math&gt; \Delta Cd &lt;/math&gt; is within the acceptable region for both values of &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; i.e. 0.40 and 0.67, and if the Cd results vary as &lt;math&gt; (\beta)^{3.5} &lt;/math&gt;, then the conditioner is successful in removing swirl. The tests for the other three installations namely, good flow conditions, partly closed valve and highly disturbed flow) may be performed for &lt;math&gt; \beta &lt;/math&gt; = 0.67, and the results for other (i ratios predicted from the &lt;math&gt; \Delta Cd - (\beta)^{3.5} &lt;/math&gt; correlation. Otherwise, the tests should be performed for a range of p ratios between 0.20 and 0.75.
# Perform test and determine the flow conditioner performance for the flow conditioner installed in good flow conditions, downstream of a half closed valve, and for either the double 90° elbow out-of-plane or the high swirl installation.

=== Effects of flow conditioning on turbine meter ===
The turbine meter is available in various manufacturer's configurations of a common theme; [[turbine| turbine blades]] and [[rotor (electric)|rotor]] configured devices. These devices are designed such that when a gas stream passes through them they will spin proportionally to the amount of gas passing over the blades in a repeatable fashion. Accuracy is then ensured by completion of a calibration, indicating the relationship between [[rotational speed]] and [[volume]], at various Reynolds Numbers. The fundamental difference between the orifice meter and the turbine meter is the flow equation derivation. The orifice meter flow calculation is based on fluid flow fundamentals (a [[First law of thermodynamics|1st Law of Thermodynamics]] derivation utilizing the pipe diameter and [[vena contracta]] diameters for the [[continuity equation]]). Deviations from theoretical expectation can be assumed under the Coefficient of Discharge. Thus, one can manufacture an orifice meter of known [[uncertainty]] with only the measurement standard in hand and access to a machine shop. The need for flow conditioning, and hence, a fully developed velocity flow profile is driven from the original determination of Cd which utilized fully developed or 'reference profiles' as explained above.

Conversely, the turbine meter operation is not rooted deeply in fundamentals of thermodynamics. This is not to say that the turbine meter is in any way an inferior device. There are sound engineering principles providing theoretical background. It is essentially an extremely repeatable device that is then assured accuracy via calibration. The calibration provides the accuracy. It is carried out in good flow conditions (flow conditions free of swirl and a uniform velocity flow profile) this is carried out for every meter manufactured. Deviations from the as-calibrated conditions would be considered installation effects, and the [[Sensitivity (control systems)|sensitivity]] of the turbine meter to these installation effects is of interest. The need for flow conditioning is driven from the sensitivity of the meter to deviations from as calibrated conditions of swirl and velocity profile.
Generally, recent research indicates that turbine meters are sensitive to swirl but not to the shape of the velocity profile. A uniform velocity profile is recommended, but no strict requirements for fully developed flow profiles are indicated. Also, no significant errors are evident when installing single or dual rotor turbine meters downstream of two elbows out-of-plane without flow conditioning devices.&lt;ref&gt;Park J.T., "Reynolds Number and Installation Effects on Turbine Meters", Fluid Flow Measurement 3r6 International Symposium, March 1995&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Micklos J.P., "Fundamentals of Gas Turbine Meters", American School of Gas Measurement Technology 1997 Proceedings p. 35&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of flow conditioning on ultrasonic meter ===
[[File:Ultrasonic meter sound path - No flow.GIF|thumb|Figure (5) showing ultrasonic meter sound path - no flow]]
Due to the relative age of the technology, it may be beneficial to discuss the operation of the multipath ultrasonic meter to illustrate the effects of flow profile distortion and swirl. There are various types of flow measurements utilizing high frequency sound. The custody transfer measurement devices available today utilize the time of travel concept. The difference in time of flight with the flow is compared to the time of flight against the flow. This difference is used to infer average flow velocity on the sound path.&lt;ref&gt;Stuart J.S., "New A,G.A. Report No. 9, Measurement of Gas by Multipath Ultrasonic Gas Meters", 1997 Operating Section Proceedings, Nashville, TN., May, 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Fig.(5) showing the Ultrasonic Meter sound path no flow which illustrates this concept.
[[File:Ultrasonic meter sound path - uniform velocity profile.jpg|thumb|Figure (6) showing Ultrasonic meter sound path - uniform velocity profile]]
The resulting flow equation for the mean velocity experienced by the sound path is given by,
&lt;br /&gt;&lt;math&gt; \bar {V}_{flow} = \left [ \frac{1}{T_{ab}} - \frac{1}{T_{ba}} \right ]\left [ \frac{Dist_{Sound path}}{2\cos \phi} \right ]&lt;/math&gt;    ----(5)&lt;br /&gt;
The case of no flow gives the actual path of the sound when there is zero flow (by equating eq.(5) to zero). In case of theoretical flow profile, say a uniform velocity flow profile where the no-slip condition on the pipe walls is not applied, Fig.(6) shows Ultrasonic Meter sound path - uniform velocity profile which illustrates the resultant sound path.
A theoretical derivation of the Mean velocity equation for this sound path becomes much more complicated. In case of a perfect fully developed real velocity profile of Ultrasonic meter which is shown in Fig.(7) indicating a possible sound path as a result of an installation in a real flow.  [[File:Ultrasonic meter sound path - fully developed flow.GIF|thumb|Figure (7) showing Ultrasonic meter sound path - fully developed flow]]
Here a mathematical derivation for this Ultrasonic meter is also becomes very complicated. Developing a robust flow algorithm to calculate the mean flow velocity for the sound path can be quite complicated. Now add to this; sound path reflection from the pipe wall, multipaths to add degrees of freedom, swirl and departure from axisymmetric fully developed flow profile and the problem of integrating the actual velocity flow profile to yield volume flow rate can be an accomplishment. Hence the real performance of ultrasonic meters downstream of perturbations, and the need for calibrations is required.&lt;ref&gt;Kamik U., Studzinskl W., Geerligs J., Rogi M., "Performance Evaluation of 8 Inch Mutipath Ultrasonic Meters", A.G.A. operating Section Operations Conference, May, 1997, Nashville TN.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Effects of flow conditioning on Coriolis meter ===
Coriolis meter shown in fig.(8) is very accurate in single-phase conditions but inaccurate to measure two-phase flows. It poses a complex fluid structure interaction problem in case of two-phase operation. There is a scarcity of theoretical models available to predict the errors reported by Coriolis meter in aforementioned conditions. [[File:Coriolis_meter.png|thumb|Figure (8) showing Coriolis meter]] Flow conditioners make no effect on meter accuracy while using wet gas due to the annular flow regime, which is not highly affected by flow conditioners. In single-phase conditions, Coriolis meter gives accurate measurement even in presence of severe flow disturbances. There is no need for flow conditioning before the meter to obtain accurate readings from it, which would be the case in other metering technologies like orifice and turbine. On the other hand, in two-phase flows, the meter consistently gives negative errors. The use of flow conditioners clearly affects the reading of the meter in aerated liquids. This phenomenon can be used to get fairly accurate estimate of flow rate in low gas volume fraction liquid flows.&lt;ref&gt;[http://repositories.tdl.org/tdl-ir/handle/1969.1/ETD-TAMU-2807 The effect of flow conditioning on straight tube Coriolis meter]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Liquid flow measurement ===
Flow conditioning makes a huge effect on the accuracy of liquid turbine meter which results in flow disturbances. These effects are mainly caused by debris on strainer screens, for various upstream piping geometries and different types of flow conditioners.
The effectiveness of a flow conditioner can be indicated by the following two key measurements:
* Percentage variation of an average meter factor over the defined range of flow disturbances for a given flow rate and inlet piping geometry. The lesser the value of percentage variation of an average meter factor over the range of flow disturbances, the better will be the performance of flow conditioner.
* Percentage meter factor repeatability for each flow disturbance, at a given flow rate and inlet piping geometry. The lesser the value of percentage meter factor repeatability at a given set of installation/operating conditions, the better will be the performance of flow conditioner.

A '''fusion torch''' is a technique for utilizing the high-temperature plasma of a [[Fusion power|fusion reactor]] to break apart other materials (especially waste materials) and convert them into a few reusable and saleable elements. It was invented in 1968 by [[Bernard J. Eastlund]] and William C. Gough while they were program managers of the controlled thermonuclear research program of the [[United States Atomic Energy Commission]] (AEC). The basic concept was to impinge the plasma leaking from fusion reactors onto solids or liquids, vaporizing, dissociating and ionizing the materials, then separating the resulting elements into separate bins for collection. Other applications of fusion plasmas such as generation of UV and optical light, and generation of hydrogen fuel, were also described in their associated 1969 paper.

==How it Works==

The process began with a tokamak, a doughnut-shaped magnetic “bottle”, containing plasma and unwanted material. This combination would result in a pool of electrons and nuclei which in turn would cause the tokamak to overflow and transfer the plasma into an outlet. This plasma then passes through a series of metal plates, differing in particular temperatures, all arranged in descending order. The atoms of elements pass over the plates that have a boiling point that is above their own. Eventually, the atoms encounter plates where the temperature is lower than their boiling point. This makes them stick onto the plate. The plates then work as a distillation system which sorts the plasma into its constituent elements. These pure elements can then be reused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://search.proquest.com/docview/224066886|title=Pure Elements|accessdate=August 14, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==1969 Paper==

In the paper ''The Fusion Torch – Closing the Cycle from Use to Reuse'', Bernard J. Eastlund and William C. Gough defined Population (food), Entropy (resources, energy, pollution), and War (human needs and behavior) as three traps that could hamper the advancement of mankind. {{quote|"The use of the fusion torch in conjunction with controlled fusion power offers a potential solution to the entropy trap in materials. - i.e. man's exhaustion of nature's stored resources (Eastlund &amp; Gough, 1969)."}} In terms of energy needs they estimated that by the year 2000 will need 140,000 megawatts of electrical capacity.&lt;ref&gt;Energy Resources, Report to the Committee on Natural Resources, publication 1000-D, (Washington: National Academy of Sciences- National Research Council, 1962).&lt;/ref&gt; They also speculated that the fusion torch concept would be useful for the separation of uranium from reactor fuel element material.

==Effects on the Environment==
Although the fusion torch will help in disposal of pollution and waste and make it available for reuse, there is also a problem that arises. The process of separating elements uses a lot of energy, and therefore creates a lot of heat. With the rise of the standards of living, all this heat that is created from using the fusion torch will be released into the atmosphere. Such a large amount of heat could cause the surface temperature of the earth to rise. This could eventually lead to severe climate modifications and put a limit on world population and standards of living. However, the heat generated from the fusion torch and fusion can be "contained" if the system is brought to Break-even temperature. Therefore, becoming self-sustaining.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/stamp/stamp.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=4325835|title=Enviornmental effect|accessdate=August 16, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5630">[[Image:Standard Model of Elementary Particles.svg|thumb|300px|The [[Standard Model]] of elementary particles, with the gauge bosons in the fourth column in red]]
In [[particle physics]], a '''gauge boson''' is a [[force carrier]], a [[boson]]ic particle that carries any of the [[fundamental interaction]]s of nature, commonly called forces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Gribbin, John | title=Q is for Quantum – An Encyclopedia of Particle Physics | publisher=Simon &amp; Schuster | year=2000 | isbn=0-684-85578-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Clark, John, E.O. | title=The Essential Dictionary of Science | publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble | year=2004 | isbn=0-7607-4616-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Elementary particle]]s, whose interactions are described by a [[gauge theory]], interact with each other by the exchange of gauge bosons—usually as [[virtual particle]]s.

All known gauge bosons have a [[spin (physics)|spin]] of 1. Therefore, all known gauge bosons are [[vector boson]]s.

Gauge bosons are different from the other kinds of bosons: first, fundamental [[scalar boson]]s (the [[Higgs boson]]); second, [[meson]]s, which are [[composite particle|composite]] bosons, made of [[quark]]s; third, larger composite, non-force-carrying bosons, such as certain [[atom]]s.

==Gauge bosons in the Standard Model==
The [[Standard Model]] of [[particle physics]] recognizes four kinds of gauge bosons: [[photons]], which carry the [[electromagnetic interaction]]; [[W and Z bosons]], which carry the [[weak interaction]]; and [[gluon]]s, which carry the [[strong interaction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author=Veltman, Martinus | title=Facts and Mysteries in Elementary Particle Physics | publisher=World Scientific | year=2003 | isbn=981-238-149-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Isolated gluons do not occur because they are [[Color charge|color-charged]] and subject to [[color confinement]].

===Multiplicity of gauge bosons===
In a [[Quantization (physics)|quantize]]d [[gauge theory]], gauge bosons are [[quantum|quanta]] of the [[gauge theory|gauge field]]s. Consequently, there are as many gauge bosons as there are generators of the gauge field. In [[quantum electrodynamics]], the gauge group is [[U(1)|''U''(1)]]; in this simple case, there is only one gauge boson. In [[quantum chromodynamics]], the more complicated group [[SU(3)|''SU''(3)]] has eight generators, corresponding to the eight gluons. The three W and Z bosons correspond (roughly) to the three generators of [[SU(2)|''SU''(2)]] in [[electroweak theory|GWS theory]].

===Massive gauge bosons===
For technical reasons{{which|date=September 2016}} involving [[gauge invariance]], gauge bosons are described mathematically by [[field (physics)|field]] equations for massless particles. Therefore, at a naïve theoretical level, all gauge bosons are required to be massless, and the forces that they describe are required to be long-ranged. The conflict between this idea and experimental evidence that the weak and strong interactions have a very short range requires further theoretical insight.

According to the Standard Model, the W and Z bosons gain mass via the [[Higgs mechanism]]. In the Higgs mechanism, the four gauge bosons (of ''SU''(2)&amp;times;''U''(1) symmetry) of the unified [[electroweak interaction]] couple to a [[Higgs field]]. This field undergoes [[spontaneous symmetry breaking]] due to the shape of its interaction potential. As a result, the universe is permeated by a nonzero Higgs [[vacuum expectation value]] (VEV). This VEV couples to three of the electroweak gauge bosons (the Ws and Z), giving them mass; the remaining gauge boson remains massless (the photon). This theory also predicts the existence of a scalar [[Higgs boson]], which has been observed in experiments at the [[LHC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CERN and the Higgs boson|url=http://press.cern/backgrounders/cern-and-higgs-boson|publisher=CERN|accessdate=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beyond the Standard Model==
===Grand unification theories===
The [[Georgi-Glashow model]] predicts additional gauge bosons named [[X and Y bosons]]. The hypothetical X and Y bosons mediate interactions between [[quark]]s and [[lepton]]s, hence violating conservation of [[baryon number]] and causing [[proton decay]]. Such bosons would be even more massive than W and Z bosons due to [[symmetry breaking]]. Analysis of data collected from such sources as the [[Super-Kamiokande]] [[neutrino detector]] has yielded no evidence of X and Y bosons.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}}

===Gravitons===
The fourth fundamental interaction, [[gravity]], may also be carried by a boson, called the [[graviton]]. In the absence of experimental evidence and a mathematically coherent theory of [[quantum gravity]], it is unknown whether this would be a gauge boson or not. The role of [[gauge invariance]] in [[general relativity]] is played by a similar{{clarify|date=September 2016}} symmetry: [[diffeomorphism invariance]].

===W' and Z' bosons===
{{main|W' and Z' bosons}}
W' and Z' bosons refer to hypothetical new gauge bosons (named in analogy with the [[Standard Model]] [[W and Z bosons]]).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9007">'''Grammage''' and '''basis weight''', in the [[pulp and paper industry|pulp and paper]] and the [[fabric]] industries, are the [[areal density]] of a paper or fabric product, that is, its [[mass]] per unit of [[area]].  
Two ways of expressing grammage are commonly used:
* Expressed in grams per square meter (g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), paper density is also known as ''grammage''.&lt;ref name="iso536"&gt;International Standard ISO 536:  Paper and board – Determination of grammage. [[International Organization for Standardization]], Geneva.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the measure used in most parts of the world.
* Expressed in terms of the mass (expressed as weight) per number of sheets, it is known as ''basis weight''. The convention used in the United States and a few other countries using US [[paper size]]s is pounds of a [[Paper ream|ream]] of 500 (or in some cases 1000) sheets of a given (raw, still uncut) basis size. Japanese paper is expressed as the weight in kg of 1,000 sheets.

==Grammage==
In the [[metric system]], the mass per unit area of all types of paper and paperboard is expressed in terms of grams per square meter (g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;). This quantity is commonly called ''[[wikt:grammage|grammage]]'' in both [[English language|English]] and [[French language|French]] ([[ISO 536]]), though printers in most English-speaking countries still refer to the "[[weight]]" of paper.

Typical office paper has 80&amp;nbsp;g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, therefore a typical [[A4_paper|A4]] sheet ({{frac|16}} m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) weighs 5&amp;nbsp;g.  The unofficial unit symbol "gsm" instead of the standard "g/m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;" is also widely encountered in English speaking countries.

Typically grammage is measured in paper mill on-line by a [[quality control system for paper, board and tissue machines|quality control system]] and verified by laboratory measurement.

==Basis weight==
In countries that use US paper sizes, a less direct measure known as ''basis weight'' is used in addition to or instead of grammage. The basis weight of paper is the density of paper expressed in terms of the mass of a [[paper ream|ream]] of given dimensions and a sheet count. In the US system, the weight is specified in [[avoirdupois]] [[pounds (mass)|pounds]] and the sheet count of a [[paper ream]] is usually 500 sheets.  However, the mass specified is not the mass of the ream that is sold to the customer.  Instead, it is the mass of the uncut "basis ream" in which the sheets have some larger size. Often, this is a size used during the manufacturing process before the paper was cut to the dimensions in which it is sold. So, to compute the mass per area, one must know
* the mass of the basis ream,
* the number of sheets in that ream, and
* the dimensions of an "uncut" sheet in that ream.

The standard dimensions and sheet count of a ream vary according to the type of paper.  These "uncut" basis sizes are not normally labelled on the product, are not formally standardized, and therefore have to be guessed or inferred somehow from trading practice.  Historically, this convention is the product of pragmatic considerations such as the size of a sheet mold.

By using the same basis sheet size for the same type of paper, consumers can easily compare papers of differing brands. Twenty pound bond paper is always lighter and thinner than 32 pound bond, no matter what its cut size. And 20 pound bond ''letter size'' and 20 pound bond ''legal size'' papers are the same weight paper having different cut size.

However, a sheet of common copy paper that has a basis weight of {{convert|20|lb|kg}} does not have the same mass as the same size sheet of coarse paper (newsprint).  In the former case, the standard ream is 500 sheets of {{convert|17|by|22|in|mm|0|adj=on}} paper, and in the latter, 500 sheets of {{convert|24|by|36|in|mm|0|adj=on}} paper.  Here are some basic ream sizes for various types of paper.  Units are inches except where noted.

Sheets {{convert|17|by|22|in|mm|0}} can be cut into four {{convert|8.5|by|11|in|mm|0|adj=on}} sheets, a standard for business stationery known conventionally as ''letter sized paper''. So, the {{convert|17|by|22|in|mm|0|adj=on}} ream became commonly used.  The {{convert|25|by|38|in|mm|0|adj=on}} book-paper ream developed because such a size can easily be cut into sixteen 6 by {{convert|9|in|mm|0|adj=on}} [[book size]]d sheets without significant waste.

Early newsprint presses printed sheets {{convert|2|by|3|ft|m|3}} in size, and so the ream dimensions for newsprint became {{convert|24|by|36|in|mm|0}}, with 500 sheets to a ream. Newsprint was made from ground wood pulp, and ground wood hanging paper ([[wallpaper]]) was made on newsprint machines. Newsprint was used as wrapping paper, and the first paper bags were made from newsprint.  The newsprint ream standard also became the standard for packaging papers, even though in packaging papers kraft pulp rather than ground wood was used for greater strength.

Paper weight is sometimes stated using the "[[number sign#Usage_in_North_America|#]]" symbol.  For example, "20#" means "20 pounds per basis ream of 500 sheets". When the density of a ream of paper is given in pounds, it is often accompanied by its "M weight".  The M weight is the weight (in pounds) of 1000 cut sheets.  Paper suppliers will often charge by M weight, since it is always consistent within a specific paper size, and because it allows a simple weight calculation for shipping charges.

For example, a 500-sheet ream of 20# {{convert|8.5|by|11|in|mm|0|adj=on}} copy paper may be specified "10 M".  1000 cut sheets (or two reams) will weigh {{convert|10|lb|abbr=on}}, half of the four reams of cut paper resulting from the 20# basis ream of {{convert|17|by|22|in|mm|0|adj=on}} paper.

==Caliper==
Paper thickness, or caliper, is a common measurement specified and required for certain printing applications. Since a paper's [[density]] is typically not directly known or specified, the thickness of any sheet of paper cannot be calculated by any method. Instead, it is measured and specified separately as its [[caliper]]. However, paper thickness for most typical business papers might be similar across comparable brands. If thickness is not specified for a paper in question, it must be either measured or guessed based on a comparable paper's specification.

Caliper is usually measured in [[Micrometres|micrometres (µm)]], or in the US also in [[thousandth of an inch|mil]]s (1&amp;nbsp;mil = 0.001&amp;nbsp;in = 25.4&amp;nbsp;µm). Commonly, 20-lb bond ranges between roughly {{convert|97|to|114|µm|in}} in thickness.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121022063704/http://www.havilandprinting.com/papercomparisons/|title=Paper Comparisions|author=|date=22 October 2012|website=archive.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Hemingray Glass Company''' was an [[United States|American]] [[glass]] manufacturing [[company]]. The company was founded by Robert Hemingray and Ralph Gray in [[Cincinnati]] in 1848.&lt;ref name="glassbottlemarks"/&gt;  In its early years the company went through numerous and frequent name changes, including Gray &amp; Hemingray; Gray, Hemingray &amp; Bros.; Gray, Hemingray &amp; Brother; Hemingray Bros. &amp; Company and R. Hemingray &amp; Company before incorporating into the Hemingray Glass Company, Inc in 1870.&lt;ref name="glassbottlemarks"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.glassbottlemarks.com/hemingray/ |title=Hemingray Glass Company |first=David |last=Whitten |work=glassbottlemarks.com |year=2015 |accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hemingray company had factories in [[Cincinnati, Ohio]] and [[Covington, Kentucky]] with main production in [[Muncie, Indiana]]. Though Hemingray was best known for its [[telegraph]] insulators, the company produced many other glass items including [[bottle]]s, [[Mason jar|fruit jars]], pressed glass [[plate (dishware)|dishes]], [[List of glassware#tumblers|tumblers]], [[battery (electricity)|battery]] jars, [[aquarium|fishbowls]], [[lantern|lantern globes]], and [[oil lamp]]s.&lt;ref name="glassbottlemarks"/&gt; In 1933, the company was sold to the [[Owens-Illinois Glass Company]] but production remained in Muncie under the Hemingray name.

The main plant in Muncie shut down in 1966&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.insulators.info/articles/hemi100.htm |title=Hemingray Glass Insulators - 100 Years Of History |first=Bill |last=Meier |work=insulators.info |year=2011 |accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and insulator production ceased.  The complex is now the used by [[Gerdau]] Ameristeel, a steel production company headquartered in [[Brazil]].

==Insulators==
Hemingray was best known for producing telegraph insulators.  To give an overview of the large variety of styles produced, the following table contains the twenty most common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hemingray.info/database/top20.php |title=Hemingray.info - The Hemingray Database: Top 20 Identified Insulators |first=Christian |last=Willis |work=hemingray.info |year=2015 |accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two numbers given in this table: the Consolidated Design (CD) number and the style number.  The CD number is from a classification system developed by collectors that refers to the shape of the insulator and is completely independent from the Hemingray Glass Company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.insulators.info/general/cdnumber.htm |title=CD Numbers Explained |first=Bill |last=Meier |work=insulators.info |year=2010 |accessdate=May 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However the style number (or name) was assigned by Hemingray to each insulator.  Due to slight modifications in design over years of production single styles can span multiple CD numbers.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hubbard model, named after [[John Hubbard (physicist)|John Hubbard]], is the simplest model of interacting particles in a lattice, with only two terms in the [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] (see example below): a kinetic term allowing for [[Quantum tunneling|tunneling]] ("hopping") of particles between sites of the lattice and a potential term consisting of an on-site interaction. The particles can either be [[fermions]], as in Hubbard's original work, or [[bosons]], when the model is referred to as either the "[[Bose–Hubbard model]]" or the "boson Hubbard model".

The Hubbard model is a good approximation for particles in a periodic potential at sufficiently low temperatures that all the particles are in the lowest [[Bloch wave|Bloch band]], as long as any long-range interactions between the particles can be ignored. If interactions between particles on different sites of the lattice are included, the model is often referred to as the "extended Hubbard model".

The model was originally proposed (in 1963) to describe electrons in solids and has since been the focus of particular interest as a model for [[high-temperature superconductivity]]. More recently, the Bose–Hubbard model has been used to describe the behavior of [[ultracold atom]]s trapped in [[optical lattice]]s. Recent [[ultracold atom]] experiments have also realised the original, fermionic Hubbard model in the hope that such experiments could yield its phase diagram.&lt;ref name=Quintanilla&gt;

For electrons in a solid, the Hubbard model can be considered as an improvement on the [[Tight binding|tight-binding]] model, which includes only the hopping term. For strong interactions, it can give qualitatively different behavior from the tight-binding model and correctly predicts the existence of so-called [[Mott insulator]]s, which are prevented from becoming conducting by the strong repulsion between the particles.

==Narrow energy band theory==
The Hubbard model is based on the [[Tight binding|tight-binding]] approximation from solid-state physics. In the tight-binding approximation, electrons are viewed as occupying the standard [[atomic orbital|orbitals]] of their constituent atoms, and then "hopping" between atoms during conduction. Mathematically, this is represented as a "hopping integral", or "transfer integral", between neighboring atoms, which can be viewed as the physical principle that creates electron bands in [[crystal]]line materials, due to overlapping between atomic orbitals. The width of the band depends upon the overlapping amplitude. However, the more general band theories do not consider interactions between electrons explicitly. They consider the interaction of a single electron with the potential of nuclei and other electrons in an average way only. By formulating conduction in terms of the hopping integral, however, the Hubbard model is able to include the so-called "on-site repulsion", which stems from the Coulomb repulsion between electrons at the same atomic orbitals. This sets up a competition between the hopping integral, which is a function of the distance and angles between neighboring atoms, and the on-site Coulomb repulsion, which is not considered in the usual band theories. The Hubbard model can therefore explain the transition from metal to insulator in certain [[metal]] oxides as they are heated by the increase in nearest-neighbor spacing, which reduces the "hopping integral" to the point where the on-site potential is dominant. Similarly, this can explain the transition from conductor to insulator in systems such as [[rare-earth]] [[pyrochlore]]s as the [[atomic number]] of the rare-earth metal increases, because the [[lattice parameter]] increases (or the angle between atoms can also change — see [[Crystal structure]]) as the rare-earth element atomic number increases, thus changing the relative importance of the hopping integral compared to the on-site repulsion.

==Example: 1D chain of hydrogen atoms==
The [[hydrogen atom]] has only one electron, in the so-called ''s'' orbital, which can either be spin up (&lt;math&gt;\uparrow&lt;/math&gt;) or spin down (&lt;math&gt;\downarrow&lt;/math&gt;). This orbital can be occupied by at most two electrons, one with [[spin (physics)|spin]] up and one down (see [[Pauli exclusion principle]]).

Now, consider a 1D chain of hydrogen atoms. Under [[band theory]], we would expect the 1s orbital to form a continuous band, which would be exactly half-full. The 1D chain of hydrogen atoms is thus predicted to be a conductor under conventional band theory.

But now consider the case where the spacing between the hydrogen atoms is gradually increased. At some point we expect that the chain must become an insulator.

Expressed in terms of the Hubbard model, on the other hand, the Hamiltonian is now made up of two components. The first component is the hopping integral. The hopping integral is typically represented by the letter &lt;math&gt;t&lt;/math&gt; because it represents the kinetic energy of electrons hopping between atoms. The second term in the Hubbard model is then the on-site repulsion &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; that represents the potential energy arising from the charges on the electrons. Written out in [[second quantization]] notation, the Hubbard [[Hamiltonian (quantum mechanics)|Hamiltonian]] then takes the form

:&lt;math&gt; \hat{H} = -t \sum_{\langle i, j \rangle,\sigma}( \hat{c}^\dagger_{i,\sigma} \hat{c}_{j,\sigma} + \hat{c}^\dagger_{j,\sigma} \hat{c}_{i,\sigma}) + U \sum_{i=1}^N \hat{n}_{i\uparrow} \hat{n}_{i\downarrow}, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\langle i,j \rangle&lt;/math&gt; represents summation over nearest-neighbor lattice sites. Note that both ''t'' and ''U'' are  positive quantities. &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}_{i\sigma} = \hat{c}_{i\sigma}^\dagger \hat{c}_{i\sigma}&lt;/math&gt; is the spin-density operator for spin &lt;math&gt;\sigma&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th site. The total density operator is &lt;math&gt;\hat{n}_i  = \hat{n}_{i \uparrow} + \hat{n}_{i\downarrow}&lt;/math&gt; and occupation of &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt;-th site for the wavefunction &lt;math&gt;\Phi&lt;/math&gt; is &lt;math&gt;n_i = \langle \Phi \vert \hat{n}_i \vert \Phi \rangle&lt;/math&gt;.

If we consider the Hamiltonian without the contribution of the second term, we are simply left with the [[tight binding]] formula from regular band theory.

When the second term is included, however, we end up with a more realistic model that also predicts a transition from conductor to insulator as the inter-atomic spacing is increased. In the limit where the spacing is infinite (or if we ignore the first term), the chain simply resolves into a set of isolated [[magnetic moment]]s. Additionally, when there are some contributions from the first term, but the material remains an insulator, the overlap integral provides for exchange interactions between neighboring magnetic moments, which may lead to a variety of interesting magnetic correlations, such as ferromagnetic, antiferromagnetic, etc. depending on the exact solutions of the model. The one-dimensional Hubbard model was solved by [[Elliott H. Lieb|Lieb]] and Wu using the [[Bethe ansatz]]. Essential progress has been achieved in the 1990s: a [[Yangian|hidden symmetry]] was discovered, and the [[S-matrix|scattering matrix]], [[Correlation function (statistical mechanics)|correlation functions]], [[thermodynamic]] and [[quantum entanglement]] were evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==More complex systems==
Although the Hubbard model is useful in describing systems such as a 1D chain of hydrogen atoms, it is important to note that in more complex systems there may be other effects that the Hubbard model does not consider. In general, insulators can be divided into Mott–Hubbard type insulators (see [[Mott insulator]]) and [[charge-transfer insulators]].

Consider the following description of a Mott–Hubbard insulator:

:&lt;math&gt;(\mathrm{Ni}^{2+} \mathrm O^{2-})_2 \longrightarrow \mathrm{Ni}^{3+} \mathrm O^{2-} + \mathrm{Ni}^{1+} \mathrm{O}^{2-}.&lt;/math&gt;

This can be seen as analogous to the Hubbard model for hydrogen chains, where conduction between unit cells can be described by a transfer integral.

However, it is possible for the electrons to exhibit another kind of behavior:

:&lt;math&gt;\mathrm{Ni}^{2+} \mathrm O^{2-} \longrightarrow \mathrm{Ni}^{1+} \mathrm O^{1-}.&lt;/math&gt;

This is known as charge transfer and results in [[charge-transfer insulators]]. Note that this is quite different from the Mott–Hubbard insulator model because there is no electron transfer between unit cells, only within a unit cell.

Both of these effects may be present and competing in complex ionic systems.

==Numerical treatment==
The fact that the Hubbard model has not been solved analytically in arbitrary dimensions has led to intense research into numerical methods for these strongly correlated electron systems.&lt;ref name="ScalapinoNumerical StudiesOfThe2DHubbardModel"&gt;
{{Cite journal
 |last=Scalapino |first=D. J.

 |pages=cond–mat/0610710
 |arxiv=cond-mat/0610710
|bibcode=2006cond.mat.10710S
 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exact treatment of the Hubbard model at [[absolute zero]] is possible using the [[Lanczos algorithm]], which produces static and dynamic properties of the system. This method requires the storing of three vectors of the size of the number of states, which limits the number of sites in the lattice to about 20 on currently{{When|date=April 2011}} available hardware. With projector and finite-temperature [[auxiliary-field Monte Carlo]], two statistical methods exist that also can provide an exact solution. For low temperatures and large lattice sizes convergence problems appear that lead to an exponential growth of computational effort due to the so-called [[sign problem]].

The Hubbard model can also be studied within [[dynamical mean-field theory]] (DMFT). This scheme maps the Hubbard Hamiltonian onto a [[Anderson impurity model|single-site impurity model]], a mapping that is formally exact only in infinite dimensions and in finite dimensions corresponds to the exact treatment of all purely local correlations only. DMFT allows one to compute the local [[Green's function]] of the Hubbard model for a given &lt;math&gt;U&lt;/math&gt; and a given temperature. Within DMFT, one can compute the evolution of the [[spectral function]] and observe the appearance of the upper and lower Hubbard bands as correlations increase.

==Background==
Substituting a [[heat pump]] to a boiler may save more than 50% of primary energy, if electricity is produced by a modern gas-steam power plant (and even more if a part of that electricity is produced from a renewable source). “[[Heat Pumping]]” is probably today one of the quickest and safest solutions to save energy and to reduce CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emission. Most of air-conditioned commercial buildings offer attractive retrofit opportunities, because:
* When a [[chiller]] is used, the [[Condenser (heat transfer)|condenser]] heat can cover (at least a part of) the heating demand;
* When a [[chiller]] is not (fully) used for cooling, it can be (at least partially) re-converted into heat pump.
The retrofit of an existing building and, even more, the design of a new one should take all possibilities of heat pumping into consideration, in such a way to make air conditioning as “reversible” as possible. Different techniques are already available, but a recent survey of monitoring results established in [[Germany]] made still appear a lot of faults, lacks of optimisation and surprisingly low COP ([[coefficient of performance]]) after, at least, one year of operation. It appears that the many mistakes would not have been discovered without monitoring. It also appears that these mistakes and disappointing results are mainly due to a lack of good understanding of the dynamic behaviour of the systems at design stage, a lack of simulation work, a lack of instrumentation, for satisfactory commissioning, optimal control and fault detection.

==Project description==
The aim of this project is to promote the most efficient combinations of heating and cooling techniques in [[air conditioning]].

An '''ignitron''' is a type of [[gas-filled tube]] used as a controlled [[rectifier]] and dating from the 1930s. Invented by [[Joseph Slepian]] while employed by [[Westinghouse Electric Corporation|Westinghouse]], Westinghouse was the original manufacturer and owned trademark rights to the name "Ignitron". Ignitrons are closely related to [[mercury-arc valve]]s but differ in the way the arc is ignited.  They function similarly to [[thyratron]]s; a triggering pulse to the igniter [[electrode]] turns the device "on", allowing a high current to flow between the [[cathode]] and [[anode]] electrodes.  After it is turned on, the current through the anode must be reduced to zero to restore the device to its nonconducting state.  They are used to switch high currents in heavy industrial applications.

==Construction and operation==
[[Image:Ignitrons.jpg|thumb|Ignitron rectifiers powering industrial process, 1945]]
An ignitron is usually a large steel container with a pool of [[mercury (element)|mercury]] in the bottom that acts as a [[cathode]] during operation. A large [[graphite]] or refractory metal cylinder, held above the pool by an insulated electrical connection, serves as the [[anode]]. An igniting [[electrode]] (called the ''ignitor''), made of a refractory semiconductor material such as silicon carbide,&lt;ref&gt; Turner pg. 7-182&lt;/ref&gt; is briefly pulsed with a high current to create a puff of electrically conductive mercury [[plasma (physics)|plasma]]. The plasma rapidly bridges the space between the mercury pool and the anode, permitting heavy conduction between the main electrodes. At the surface of the mercury, heating by the resulting arc liberates large numbers of [[electron]]s which help to maintain the mercury [[electrical arc|arc]]. The mercury surface thus serves as the cathode, and [[Electric current|current]] is normally only in one direction. Once ignited, an ignitron will continue to pass current until either the current is externally interrupted or the voltage applied between cathode and anode is reversed.&lt;ref&gt; L.W. Turner,(ed), ''Electronics Engineer's Reference Book'', 4th ed. Newnes-Butterworth, London 1976 {{ISBN|0408001682}} pages 7-181 through 7-189&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Ignitrons were long used as high-current rectifiers in major industrial and utility installations where thousands of amperes of [[alternating current|AC]] current must be converted to [[direct current|DC]], such as [[aluminum]] smelters. Ignitrons were used to control the current in electric [[welding]] machines.  Large [[electric motor]]s were also controlled by ignitrons used in gated{{clarify|date=June 2013}} fashion, in a manner similar to modern semiconductor devices such as [[silicon controlled rectifier]]s and [[TRIAC|triac]]s. Many electric [[locomotive]]s used them in conjunction with [[transformer]]s to convert high voltage AC from the [[overhead lines]] to relatively low voltage DC for the [[traction motors]]. The Pennsylvania Railroad's [[PRR_E44|E44]] freight locomotives carried on-board ignitrons, as did the Russian [[:ru:ВЛ60|ВЛ-60]] freight locomotive. For many modern applications, ignitrons have been replaced by solid state alternatives.

Because they are far more resistant to damage due to [[overcurrent]] or back-voltage, ignitrons are still manufactured and used in preference to semiconductors in some installations. For example, specially constructed "pulse rated" ignitrons are still used in certain [[pulsed power]] applications. These devices can switch hundreds of kiloamperes and hold off as much as 50kV. The anodes in these devices are often fabricated from a [[Refraction (metallurgy)|refractory]] metal, usually [[molybdenum]], to handle reverse current during [[ringing (signal)|ringing]] (or oscillatory) discharges without damage. Pulse rated ignitrons usually operate at very low [[duty cycle]]s. They are often used to switch high energy [[capacitor]] banks during [[electromagnetic forming]], [[electrohydraulic forming]], or for emergency short-circuiting of high voltage power sources ([[Crowbar (circuit)|"crowbar"]] switching).
[[File:Philips ignitron pl5551a.jpg |thumb|right| An ignitron rated 56 amperes. Cooling jacket connections visible. In use the device was mounted so that the text would be upright. ]]

==Comparison with mercury-arc valve==
Although the basic principles of how the arc is formed, along with many aspects of construction, are very similar to other types of mercury-arc valves, ignitrons differ from other mercury-arc valves in that the arc is ignited each time a conduction cycle is started, and then extinguished when the current falls below a critical threshold.

In other types of mercury-arc valve, the arc is ignited just once when the valve is first energised, and thereafter remains permanently established, alternating between the main anode(s) and a low-power ''auxiliary anode'' or ''keep-alive circuit''.  Moreover, control grids are required in order to adjust the timing of the start of conduction.

The action of igniting the arc at a controlled time, each cycle, allows the ignitron to dispense with the auxiliary anode and control grids required by other mercury-arc valves.  However, a disadvantage is that the ignition electrode must be positioned very accurately, just barely touching the surface of the mercury pool, which means that ignitrons must be installed very accurately within a few degrees of an upright position.

'''Dr John D. Goss-Custard''' is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[behavioural ecology|behavioural ecologist]]; he was one of the first scientists to carry out field work on [[foraging]] behaviour making use of optimising models, specifically the [[optimal diet model]].  After completing a BSc degree in Zoology at the [[University of Bristol]], he moved to the [[University of Aberdeen]] to carry out research for a PhD degree, which he was awarded in 1966.  The University of Aberdeen awarded him its [[DSc]] degree in 1987.

Goss-Custard's PhD was based on the study of foraging in the [[Common Redshank]].&lt;ref&gt;Goss-Custard, J. D (1977).  The energetics of prey selection by redshank, ''Tringa tetanus'' (L.).

Sargent (Eds.), ''Foraging behavior'', pp. 115-133.  New York: Garland.&lt;/ref&gt;  Subsequently, he worked at the [[Centre for Ecology and Hydrology]]'s [[Furzebrook Research Station]] at [[Wareham, Dorset]], leading an extensive project on the foraging of overwintering [[Eurasian Oystercatcher]]s on the estuary of the [[River Exe]].&lt;ref&gt;Durell, S. E. A. Le V. dit, &amp; Goss-Custard, J. D (1984).  Prey selection within a size-class of mussels, ''Mytilus edulis'', by oystercatchers, ''Haematopus ostralegus''.  ''Animal Behaviour, 32'', 1197-1203.&lt;/ref&gt;  This project led to one of the first uses of [[agent-based modelling]] to predict ecological relationships in an extended landscape; the model, developed for the Exe estuary, was subsequently tested successfully on [[the Wash]].&lt;ref&gt;Goss-Custard, J. D., &amp; Stillman, R. A (2008).  Individual-based models and the management of shorebird populations.  ''Natural Resource Modeling, 21'', 3-71.&lt;/ref&gt;  This work was surveyed in a book that he edited.&lt;ref&gt;Goss-Custard, J. D. (Ed.) (1996).  ''The Oystercatcher: From individuals to populations''. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Goss-Custard retired from his post at CEH in 2002.  Although he did not hold a substantive university post, Goss-Custard held an honorary position at the [[University of Exeter]] for many years, and is currently a Visiting Professor at the [[University of Bournemouth]].&lt;ref&gt;http://individualecology.bournemouth.ac.uk/people.html, Downloaded 4th March 2017&lt;/ref&gt;  He co-supervised PhD degrees with colleagues at the University of Exeter and also the [[University of Oxford]].

'''Kinetic Inhibitors''' are a new and evolving technology of a class of Low Dosage Hydrate Inhibitors (LDHI) that are [[polymers]] and [[copolymers]] (or a mix thereof). The most common of which is [[polyvinylcaprolactam]] (PVCap).&lt;ref name="Kelland"&gt;[[Malcolm Kelland|Kelland, Malcolm]] et al. A New Class of Hydrate Inhibitor. 2000. http://www.iris.no/internet/student.nsf/199f312efd2a0cacc125680e00635b85/b58dcb01591e3feac125768f004f4a66/$FILE/Fagernes%20paper.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; These inhibitors are primarily utilized to retard the formation of [[clathrate hydrates]]. This problem becomes most prominent in [[flow lines]] when hydrocarbons and water flow through a line. The pressure and cold temperatures that could be exposed to the flow lines provides an environment in which clathrate hydrates can form and plug up the flow line. The inhibitors generally slow the formation of the hydrates enough so the fluid reaches storage without causing blockage.&lt;ref&gt;Sloan et al. Hydrates: State of the art Inside and Outside flow lines. SPE. 2009. http://www.spe.org/jpt/print/archives/2009/12/19DAS.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==
There may be variations on the types and structure of the polymer used as the inhibitor. However, in general, while the gas hydrate is forming, the cavity where the hydrocarbon usually resides. Instead, the [[alkyl]] group penetrates the cavity followed by the [[carbonyl]] group of the [[amide]] group [[hydrogen bond]]ing to the surface of the hydrate, thus preventing the formation of hydrates.&lt;ref name="Kelland" /&gt;

==Uses==
These inhibitors chemically retard the formation of clathrate hydrates. Dosage of such inhibitors in the fluid is usually .3% to .5% by weight of the fluid, compared to 10% to 50% by weight for [[thermodynamic inhibitors]] for prevention of clathrate formation.&lt;ref name="Kelland" /&gt; Due to this and other factors, kinetic inhibitors are more cost effective than thermodynamic inhibitors. However, if the fluid is in a static environment (i.e. [[packer fluid]]), kinetic inhibitors will have limited effect as hydrates will still form over sufficient time.&lt;ref&gt;Frostman, Lynn. Anti-Agglomerant Low Dosage Hydrate Inhibitors. 2000. http://www.coqa-inc.org/add20010531LDHI.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; At this point the only viable option is thermodynamic inhibitors.

'''Luhansk power station''' ({{lang-uk|Луганська ТЕС}}, formerly '''Luhanskaya GRES''') is a [[thermal power station]] north of [[Shchastia]], near [[Luhansk]], [[Ukraine]]. It was built between 1950 and 1956 and its first generator was connected to the grid on 30 September 1956. In 1957, 4&amp;nbsp;turbines and 7&amp;nbsp;boilers went in service. In 1958, it was completed.

Between 1979 and 2004, Luhansk power station was modernized. It consists today of 4 units with 200&amp;nbsp;MW, 3 units of 175&amp;nbsp;MW and 1 unit of 100&amp;nbsp;MW. The generator building of Luhansk power station, which has 3 {{convert|250|m}} tall chimneys, is {{convert|672|m}} long.

==War in Donbass==
On 3 September 2014, Ukrainian [[Aidar Battalion]] commander Sergei Melnychuk announced that they have mined the plant (which gives electricity to 98% of Luhansk Oblast), and that they will blow it up if the separatist forces advanced.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ru.tsn.ua/ukrayina/batalon-aydar-zaminiroval-tes-na-luganschine-384771.html Батальон "Айдар" заминировал ТЭС на Луганщине] Ru.tsn.ua, 3 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt; On 17 September, part of the plant exploded due to combat in the zone, while firefighters couldn't act due to the fire and the mines planted.&lt;ref&gt;[http://kp.ua/politics/470550-vzorvana-luhanskaia-elektrostantsyia-obespechyvauischaia-vsui-oblast Взорвана Луганская электростанция, область осталась без света &amp;#91;Видео&amp;#93;] [[Komsomolskaya Pravda in Ukraine]], 17 September 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

* those that determine the response of a '''structure''' to a given action, e.g. testing of composite beams, aircraft structures to destruction, etc.

== Mechanical testing of materials ==
[[File:Eprouvette plate cassee wb.JPG|thumb|Tensile test. A standard specimen is subjected to an gradually increasing load (force) until failure occurs. The resultant load-displacement behaviour is used to determine a [[stress–strain curve]], from which a number of mechanical properties can be measured.]]
There exists a large number of tests, many of which are standardized, to determine the various mechanical properties of materials. In general, such tests set out to obtain geometry-independent properties; i.e. those intrinsic to the bulk material. In practice this is not always feasible, since even in tensile tests, certain properties can be influenced by specimen size and/or geometry. Here is a listing of some of the most common tests:&lt;ref name="Smithells"&gt;Ed. Gale, W.F.; Totemeier, T.C. (2004), Smithells Metals Reference Book (8th Edition), Elsevier&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Hardness Testing]]
**[[Vickers hardness test]] (HV), which has one of the widest scales
**[[Brinell hardness test]] (HB)
**[[Knoop hardness test]] (HK), for measurement over small areas
**[[Janka hardness test]], for wood
**[[Meyer hardness test]]
**[[Rockwell scale|Rockwell hardness test]] (HR), principally used in the USA
**[[Shore durometer]] hardness, used for polymers
**[[Barcol hardness test]], for composite materials
*[[Tensile testing]], used to obtain the stress-strain curve for a material, and from there, properties such as Young modulus, yield (or proof) stress, tensile stress and % elongation to failure.
*Impact testing
**[[Izod test]]
**[[Charpy test]]
*Fracture toughness testing
**Linear-elastic (K&lt;sub&gt;Ic&lt;/sub&gt;)
**K–R curve
**Elastic plastic (J&lt;sub&gt;Ic&lt;/sub&gt;, CTOD)
*[[Viscoplasticity#Creep_test|Creep Testing]], for the mechanical behaviour of materials at high temperatures (relative to their melting point)
*Fatigue Testing, for the behaviour of materials under cyclic loading
**Load-controlled smooth specimen tests
**Strain-controlled smooth specimen tests
**Fatigue crack growth testing
*[[Non-Destructive Testing]]

==Flora and fauna==
The region contains boreal forests with dwarf [[black spruce]] (''Picea mariana'') and [[balsam fir]] (''Abies balsamea''), [[dwarf kalmia]] (''Kalmia polifolia''), and various [[moss]]es. Various mixed evergreen and deciduous shrubs can be found in exposed areas.

The [[Arctic hare]] (''Lepus arcticus'') is found in this region. It is their southernmost limit to their range.&lt;ref name="nationalgeographic1"/&gt;

Other species include:
*[[Canada goose]] (''Branta canadensis'')
*[[Great horned owl]] (''Bubo virginianus'')
*[[Brown-headed cowbird]] (''Molothrus ater'')
*[[Snowshoe hare]] (''Lepus americanus'')
*[[Caribou]] (''Rangifer tarandus'')
*[[Red fox]] (''Vulpes vulpes'')
*[[Newfoundland pine marten]] (''Martes americana atrata'')

==Conservation==
The region is threatened by an increase in harvest of wood for lumber and the [[pulp and paper industry]]. Higher elevations are mostly threatened by mining interests and granite quarrying. Further threats come from high all-terrain vehicle traffic, which affect some areas.&lt;ref name="eoearth1"/&gt;

80 to 90 percent of the region is considered to be intact. Large areas of the region are protected. These are:
*[[Gros Morne National Park]]: Comprising upper elevations, and located in western Newfoundland, this area contains 1,942&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. of protected land.
*[[King George IV Ecological Reserve]]: Also located in western Newfoundland, this area contains 19&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of protected land.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ecc.gov.nl.ca/parks/wer/r_kge/index.html|title=King George IV Ecological Reserve|last=|first=|date=|website=Department of Environment and Climate Change|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-04-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''nickel–hydrogen battery''' (NiH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; or Ni–H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) is a rechargeable electrochemical power source based on [[nickel]] and [[hydrogen]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.che.sc.edu/faculty/weidner/Publications/Weidner_JPS_141_326.pdf A simplified physics-based model for nickel hydrogen battery]&lt;/ref&gt; It differs from a [[Nickel–metal hydride battery|nickel–metal hydride (NIMH) battery]] by the use of [[hydrogen]] in gaseous form, stored in a pressurized [[Electrochemical cell|cell]] at up to 1200&amp;nbsp;[[Pounds per square inch|psi]] (82.7&amp;nbsp;[[Bar (unit)|bar]]) pressure.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/offices/oce/llis/0704.html Nickel-hydrogen spacecraft battery handling and storage practice]&lt;/ref&gt; The Nickel–hydrogen battery was patented on Feb 25, 1971 by [[Alexandr Ilich Kloss]] and [[Boris Ioselevich Tsenter]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/patents/US3669744 Hermetically sealed nickel-hydrogen storage cell US Patent 3669744]&lt;/ref&gt;

NiH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells using 26% [[potassium hydroxide]] (KOH) as an [[electrolyte]] have shown a [[service life]] of 15 years or more at 80% [[depth of discharge]] (DOD)&lt;ref&gt;[http://pdf.aiaa.org/jaPreview/JPP/1996/PVJAPRE24119.pdf Potassium hydroxide electrolyte for long-term nickel-hydrogen  geosynchronous missions]&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[energy density]] is 75 [[Watt hour|Wh]]/[[kg]], 60 Wh/dm&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name="Miller"/&gt; [[Power-to-weight ratio|specific power]] 220 W/kg.&lt;ref name="NASA/CR—2001-210563/PART2 -Pag.10"&gt;[http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2001/CR-2001-210563-PART2.pdf NASA/CR—2001-210563/PART2 -Pag.10] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081219191837/http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2001/CR-2001-210563-PART2.pdf |date=2008-12-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[open-circuit voltage]] is 1.55 [[Volt|V]],  the average voltage during discharge is  1.25 V.&lt;ref&gt;[http://theses.gla.ac.uk/373/01/2008AsifPhD.pdf Optimization of spacecraft electrical power subsystems -Pag.40]&lt;/ref&gt;

While the energy density is only around one third as that of a [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium battery]], the distinctive virtue of the nickel–hydrogen battery is its long life: the cells handle more than 20,000 [[charge cycle]]s&lt;ref name="ieeexplore.ieee.org"&gt;[http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/Xplore/login.jsp?url=/iel3/62/3208/00103781.pdf?arnumber=103781 Five-year update: nickel hydrogen industry survey]&lt;/ref&gt; with 85% energy efficiency and 100% [[faradaic efficiency]].

The nickel-hydrogen battery combines the positive nickel electrode of a nickel-cadmium battery and the negative electrode, including the catalyst and gas diffusion elements, of a [[fuel cell]]. During discharge, hydrogen contained in the pressure vessel is oxidized into water while  the  nickel oxyhydroxide electrode is reduced to nickel hydroxide. Water is consumed at the nickel electrode and produced at the hydrogen electrode, so the concentration of the potassium hydroxide electrolyte does not change. As the battery discharges, the hydrogen pressure drops, providing a reliable state of charge indicator. In one communication satellite battery, the pressure at full charge was over 500 pounds/square inch (3.4 MPa), dropping to only about 15 PSI (0.1 MPa) at full discharge.

If the cell is over-charged, the oxygen produced at the nickel electrode reacts with the hydrogen present in the cell and forms water; as a consequence the cells can withstand overcharging as long as the heat generated can be dissipated.{{dubious|date=December 2013}}

The cells have the disadvantage of relatively high self-discharge rate, i.e. chemical reduction of Ni(III) into Ni(II) in the cathode:

NiOOH + 0.5 H2 = Ni(OH)2.

which is proportional to the pressure of hydrogen in the cell; in some designs, 50% of the capacity can be lost after only a few days' storage. Self-discharge is less at lower temperature.

Compared with other rechargeable batteries, a nickel-hydrogen battery provides good [[specific energy]] of 55-60 watthours/kg, and very long cycle life (40,000 cycles at 40% DOD) and operating life (&gt; 15 years) in satellite applications. The cells can tolerate overcharging and accidental polarity reversal, and the hydrogen pressure in the cell provides a good indication of the state of charge.  However, the gaseous nature of hydrogen means that the volume efficiency is relatively low (60-100 Wh/L for an IPV (individual pressure vessel) cell), and the high pressure required makes for high-cost pressure vessels.&lt;ref name=Linden02/&gt;

The positive electrode is made up of a dry [[sintered]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://ntrs.nasa.gov/archive/nasa/casi.ntrs.nasa.gov/19980237948_1998394779.pdf  Performance comparison between NiH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; dry sinter and slurry electrode cells]&lt;/ref&gt; porous nickel plaque, which contains [[nickel hydroxide]]. The negative [[hydrogen]] [[electrode]] utilises a teflon-bonded [[platinum black]] [[catalyst]] at a rather high loading of 7&amp;nbsp;mg/cm2, the separator is knit zirconia cloth(ZYK-15 Zircar) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.azom.com/details.asp?ArticleID=3086#_Zirconia_Cloth_Battery_Separators] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080817030425/http://www.azom.com/details.asp?ArticleID=3086|date=2008-08-17}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://micro.magnet.fsu.edu/electromag/electricity/batteries/nickelhydrogen.html Nickel-Hydrogen Batteries]&lt;/ref&gt; Asbestos was used in the past.

The Hubble replacement batteries are produced with a wet slurry process where a binder agent and powdered metallic materials are [[Molding (process)|molded]] and heated to boil off the liquid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/pdf/252457main_FS_Batteries.pdf Hubble space telescope servicing mission 4 batteries]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designs==
* Individual pressure vessel (IPV) design consists of a single unit of NiH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cells in a pressure vessel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/GLTRS/browse.pl?1994/TM-106795.html Nickel hydrogen batteries-an overview] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090412050505/http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/cgi-bin/GLTRS/browse.pl?1994%2FTM-106795.html |date=2009-04-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Common pressure vessel (CPV) design consist of two NiH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; cell stacks in series in a common pressure vessel. The CPV provides a slightly higher [[specific energy]] than the IPV.
*Single pressure vessel (SPV) design combines up to 22 cells in series in a single pressure vessel.
*Bipolar design is based on thick [[electrode]]s,  positive-to-negative back-to-back stacked in a SPV.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1983iece....4.1568A Development of a large scale bipolar NiH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; battery].&lt;/ref&gt;
* Dependent pressure vessel (DPV) cell design offers higher specific energy and reduced cost.&lt;ref&gt;[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1995sert.nasa...13C 1995–dependent pressure vessel (DPV)]&lt;/ref&gt;
*Common/dependent pressure vessel (C/DPV) is a hybrid of the common pressure vessel (CPV) and the dependent pressure vessel (DPV) with a high volumetric efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.techbriefs.com/component/content/article/915 Common/dependent-pressure-vessel nickel-hydrogen Batteries]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5769">An offshore [[Crane (machine)| crane]] [[shock absorber]] is a gas spring with hydraulic damping used to reduce dynamic loads during offshore lifting. The lifting capacity of the offshore crane can be increased significantly during lifting in high sea states if a shock absorber is fitted. 
&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safelink.no/ The Engineers Guide] Safelink AS&lt;/ref&gt;

==Crane design load==
Offshore lifting capacity is governed by [[classification society]] rules. The fundamental rule is that the design load should not be exceeded. The design load is given by:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; F_m= \psi m_s g &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Where: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; F_m &lt;/math&gt; - Crane design load&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt; - Dynamic coefficient&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; m_s &lt;/math&gt; - Safe working load&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt;  g &lt;/math&gt; - Acceleration of gravity &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The classification societies require that &lt;math&gt; \psi  &lt;/math&gt; ≥1.3 for offshore cranes. This means that &lt;math&gt; m_s &lt;/math&gt; cannot exceed &lt;math&gt; \frac {F_m}{\psi g}  &lt;/math&gt; even for platform lifts. &lt;ref&gt; EN13852-1:2004 Cranes - Offshore cranes - Part 1: General - purpose offshore cranes
&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; DNV Standard For Certification No. 2.22 Lifting Appliances October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt; API 2C 7th Ed.  Specification for Offshore Pedestal-mounted Cranes&lt;/ref&gt;
==Dynamic load==

To calculate the dynamic load the classification societies use [[energy]] equations. The [[kinetic energy]] of the load is expressed as:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; E_k=\frac {1}{2} m_s v_r^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Where: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; E_k &lt;/math&gt; - Kinetic energy of the load &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; v_r &lt;/math&gt; - Relative velocity between crane hook and load &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Energy absorbed by the crane is given by:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; E_c=\frac {1}{2} k y^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Where: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; E_c &lt;/math&gt; - Spring energy stored in crane structure&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; k &lt;/math&gt; - Stiffness of offshore crane&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; y &lt;/math&gt; - Vertical displacement of crane hook&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The pring force is given by:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; F_c=ky&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Combining the two previous equations yields an alternative description of the energy stored in the crane structure:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; E_c=\frac {1}{2}k (\frac {F_c}{k})^2=\frac {F_c^2}{2k}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
During an offshore lift the crane does not start to absorb energy from the load before the force in the crane wire exceeds the static weight of the load, which means that we can write the energy absorption of the crane as:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; E_c=\frac {(m_s \psi g-m_s g)^2}{2k}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Setting &lt;math&gt; E_c &lt;/math&gt; equal to &lt;math&gt; E_k &lt;/math&gt;:
&lt;math&gt; \frac {(m_s \psi g-m_s g)^2}{2k}=\frac {1}{2} m_s v_r^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
And solving for &lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt;: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \psi= 1+\frac {v_r}{g}\sqrt{\frac {k}{m}} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The dynamic factor will always be larger than 1 because there will always be a velocity difference between the crane hook and the load during offshore lifts. The value of &lt;math&gt; \psi &lt;/math&gt; determines the lifting capacity as a function of &lt;math&gt; v_r &lt;/math&gt;  which is dependent on the significant wave height.
If the offshore crane has a shock absorber mounted it will absorb energy according to:&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; E_a=\eta \mu S  m_s g (\psi -1)&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Where: &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; E_a &lt;/math&gt; - Energy absorbed by shock absorber&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \mu &lt;/math&gt; - Stroke utilization (safety factor), standard value 0.9&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \eta &lt;/math&gt; - Efficiency of shock absorber, usually possible to get close to 0.9&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; S &lt;/math&gt; - Stroke length&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Adding this to the energy balance yields:
[[File:Dynamic load.png|thumb|Dynamic coefficient versus relative velocity]]
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \frac {(m_s \psi g-m_s g)^2}{2k}+\eta \mu S  m_s g (\psi -1)=\frac {1}{2} m_s v_r^2&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Again solving for ψ:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; \psi=1+ \frac {\sqrt{(\mu \eta S k)^2+m_s k v_r^2}-\mu \eta S k} {m_s g}&lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
The plot to the right shows the effect of the shock absorber stroke length.

==Estimating relative velocity==
The relative velocity is defined by several classification societies as:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; v_r=\frac {1} {2} v_L + \sqrt{v_d^2 + v_c^2} &lt;/math&gt;&lt;br /&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
Where:
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; v_L &lt;/math&gt; - Maximum crane lifting velocity at this SWL &lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; v_d &lt;/math&gt; - Vertical velocity of the deck which the load is placed on&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; v_c &lt;/math&gt; - Vertical velocity of the crane tip due to wave motion&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;math&gt; v_L &lt;/math&gt; has to be gathered from crane user manual or be measured. The deck velocity can be estimated from Table 1.
&lt;br /&gt;
&lt;br /&gt;

{| class="wikitable"
|+ Table 1: Deck velocity estimation
! Lifting from or to !! &lt;math&gt; v_d &lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| Platform or fixed structure || &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Supply boat or barge || &lt;math&gt; 0.6 H_s &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; H_s &lt;/math&gt; ≤3  &lt;br /&gt; &lt;math&gt; 1.8 + 0.3(H_s-3) &lt;/math&gt; if &lt;math&gt; H_s &lt;/math&gt;&gt;3 
|-
|}

&lt;br /&gt;
The crane tip velocity, &lt;math&gt;v_c &lt;/math&gt;, can be estimated by Table 2.
&lt;br /&gt;
[[File:Dynamic factor versus significant wave heigth.png|thumb|Dynamic factor versus significant wave height]]
&lt;br /&gt;
{| class="wikitable"
|+ Table 2: Crane tip velocity 
! Lifting from or to !! &lt;math&gt; v_d &lt;/math&gt; 
|-
| Platform or fixed structure || &lt;math&gt;0&lt;/math&gt;
|-
| Tension leg platform or Spar|| &lt;math&gt; 0.05 H_s &lt;/math&gt;  
|-
| Semisubmersible|| &lt;math&gt; 0.082 H_s^2 &lt;/math&gt;  
|-
| FPSO or drillship|| &lt;math&gt; 0.164 H_s^2 &lt;/math&gt;  
|-

|}

&lt;br /&gt;
These estimations are conservative and for large ships/rigs they may deviate significantly from reality.
A plot of the dynamic factor versus significant wave height for a crane mounted on a semisubmersible and lifting from supply boat is shown above to the right.

'''Pavement lights''' (UK), '''vault lights''' (US), '''floor lights''', or '''sidewalk prisms''' are flat-topped walk-on [[skylights]], usually set into pavement (sidewalks) or floors to let sunlight into the space below. They often use [[prism lighting|anidolic lighting prisms]] to throw the light sideways under the building. They declined in popularity with the advent of cheap electric lighting. 

Some cities are systematically removing historic sidewalk lights; others are restoring them. Pavement lights have been used in a few new architectural designs. {{See below|Gallery}}

Sidewalk prisms are a method of [[daylighting]] basements, and are able to serve as a sole source of illumination during the day. At night, lighting in the basements beneath produces a glowing sidewalk.&lt;ref name=victoria /&gt; Vault lights may be used to make subterranean space useful.&lt;ref name=recon /&gt;  They are more common in city centers, [[urban density|dense]], high-rent areas where space is valuable.&lt;ref name=recon /&gt; Historically, landlords took an interest in improving not only the [[floor area ratio]], but the amount of space that was naturally lit, on the grounds that this was profitable.&lt;ref name= handbook /&gt; Occupiers valued daylight not only as a way of saving on artificial lighting costs (which were higher historically), but also as a way to let premises remain cooler in summer, and a way to save on ventilation costs (if using [[gas lighting]] rather than [[arc lamp]]s or early [[incandescent light]]s).&lt;ref name= handbook /&gt;

Pavement lights and related products were historically marketed as a way of saving on artificial lighting costs and making space more usable and pleasant.&lt;ref name=handbook /&gt; Modern studies of [[daylight redirecting film|similar daylighting technology]] provide evidence for those claims.&lt;ref name=DoD /&gt;

Vault lights also are used in floors under glass roofs, for example in Budapest's historic [[Párizsi udvar]]&lt;ref name=Parizi /&gt; and New York's [[Pennsylvania Station (1910–1963)|mostly-demolished old Pennsylvania Station]].&lt;ref name=images_penn_station /&gt; {{See below|Current state and trends}} Vault lights also could be set into the basement floor, underneath other vault lights, creating a double-deck arrangement, which would light the [[subbasement]].&lt;ref name=NPS /&gt; Manhole covers and coalhole covers with lighting elements were also made.&lt;ref name=recon /&gt; Some steps have vault lights set into the vertical [[stair riser]]s.&lt;ref name=stairs /&gt;

Older cities and smaller centers around the world have or have had pavement lights.&lt;ref name=glassian_gallery /&gt; Most such lights are approximately a century old,&lt;ref name=recon /&gt; although lights are being installed in some new construction.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt;

== History ==
A basement that extends below a sidewalk or pavement is called an areaway,&lt;ref name=recon /&gt; a sidewalk vault,&lt;ref name=replacing_structure /&gt;, or a hollow sidewalk.&lt;ref name=sacramento /&gt; In some cities, these areaways were created by the raising of the street level to combat floods, and in some cases they form an (often now abandoned) [[underground city|underground tunnel network]].&lt;ref name=statesman /&gt;&lt;ref name=sacramento /&gt;&lt;ref name=chicagotribune /&gt; To light these spaces, sidewalks incorporated gratings, which were a trip hazard and let water and street dirt as well as light into the basement. Replacing the open gratings with glass was an obvious improvement.&lt;ref name=glassian /&gt; 

=== Frames ===
[[File:Rockwell vaultlight colourized.png|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=A large circular glass lens with a flat top and a stepped domed bottom. The glass is purple, with the shade darkening towards the top. The glass is set in a wide and ornate circular frame engraved with a semi-geometric ring-of-roundels design that looks a bit [[Art Deco]], although from 1834. |Rockwell vault light, with one large piece of glass&lt;ref name=rockwell_patent /&gt;]]
Sidewalk prisms developed from [[deck prism]]s, which were used to let light through the decks of ships. The earliest pavement light (Rockwell, 1834)&lt;ref name=rockwell_patent /&gt; used a single large round glass lens set in an iron frame. The large lens was directly exposed to traffic, and if the lens broke, a large hole was left in the pavement, which was potentially unsafe for pedestrians.&lt;ref name=glassian /&gt;&lt;ref name=hyatt_patent /&gt;

[[Thaddeus Hyatt]] corrected these faults with his "Hyatt light" of 1854.&lt;ref name=hyatt_patent /&gt; Many small lenses ("bull's-eyes") were set in a [[wrought iron|wrought-iron]] frame,&lt;ref name=LuxferCat /&gt;&lt;ref name=glassian /&gt; (later [[cast iron]]&lt;ref name=hargreaves /&gt;), and the frame included raised nubs around each lens to improve traction in wet weather and to protect them from damage and wear. Even if all the lenses were broken out, the panel would still be safe to walk on.&lt;ref name=glassian /&gt;

In the 1930s, London authorities ruled that glass sections could not be larger than 100&amp;nbsp;mm by 100&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref name=size /&gt; Modern [[glass floor]]s are made of [[laminated glass|laminated]] and [[toughened glass]] pavers, which can be substantially larger. They have an upper protective layer that can be replaced if it becomes chipped or cracked.&lt;ref name=Campbell-Dollaghan /&gt; The top surface of the pavers may also be chosen and treated to improve traction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=WalkerGlass.com |url=http://walkerglass.com/products/anti-slip-glass/ |title=Anti-slip Glass &amp;#124; Walker Textures™ |publisher=Walkerglass.com |date= |accessdate=2017-11-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171022085047/http://walkerglass.com/products/anti-slip-glass/ |archivedate=2017-10-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Armored pavement light element.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.8|alt=A shallow square of glass, surrounded by a metal rim, set in [[rebar]]-reinforced concrete. Cutaway view.|Armoured glass in concrete]]

Wrought iron,&lt;ref name=LuxferCat /&gt;&lt;ref name=glassian /&gt; cast iron,&lt;ref name=hargreaves /&gt; and stainless steel &lt;ref name=stainless /&gt; frames have all been used. [[Reinforced concrete]] slabs began to replace iron frames in the 1890s in New York. Benefits claimed included less condensation (due to the lower [[thermal conductivity]])&lt;ref name=Sweet1906 /&gt; and a less slippery surface when wet.&lt;ref name=NYT /&gt; Concrete panels may be pre-cast or cast in-situ.&lt;ref name=insitu /&gt;&lt;ref name=sweet1915 /&gt;  {{See below|pre=for process details|External links}}

Late concrete panels often were made with metal-framed "armored prisms", which were intended to prevent breakage and make replacing individual prisms easier. The glass is not cast into the concrete but [[caulking|caulked]] into the frame. Rather than chiselling out the old glass, the glass can be popped out of the frame.&lt;ref name=sweet1927 /&gt;

[[Translucent concrete]] has also been proposed as a floor material.&lt;ref name=translucent_concrete /&gt; This would essentially make it a vault light with very small ([[fiberoptic]]) lighting elements. It also innately [[waveguide|redirects the light]] from the [[Angle of incidence (optics)|angle of incidence]] to an angle ~parallel to the optical fibers (usually, perpendicular to the surface of the concrete).

=== Transparent elements ===
The transparent elements may be referred to as prisms or lenses (depending on shape), or as jewels.&lt;ref name=glassian /&gt;

==== Glass color ====
[[File:Solarized vault lights.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|alt=Shallow purple glass squares with deep right-angled prisms hanging from them. They are coloured purple, with the shade intensifying towards the top.|Solarized pendant prims, showing a gradient in the solarization.]]
The glass in many old pavement lights is now either purple or straw-colored. This is a side-effect of the manufacturing process. Pure [[silica]] glass is transparent, but older glass manufacture often used silica from sand, which contains iron and other impurities.&lt;ref name=solarized/&gt; Iron produces a greenish tint in the finished glass. To remove this effect, a "decolorizer" such as [[manganese dioxide]] ("glassmakers' soap") was added during the manufacture of the glass.

When exposed to [[ultraviolet light]], the manganese slowly "solarizes", turning purple,&lt;ref name=solarized/&gt; which is why many existing sidewalk prisms are now purple.&lt;ref name=victoria /&gt; [[WWI]] increased demand for manganese in the US and cut off the supply of high-grade ore from Germany,&lt;ref name=USGS /&gt; so [[selenium dioxide]] was used as a decolorizer instead.&lt;ref name=glassian_purple/&gt; Selenium also solarizes, but to a straw color.&lt;ref name=solarized/&gt;

Replacement glass that has been tinted purple deliberately, in order to match the current colour, has been used in some historic restoration projects.&lt;ref name=seattle/&gt;

 }}
In 1871 London, Hayward Brothers patented their "semi-[[prism (optics)#Reflective prism|prism]]": changing the shape of the glass by adding pendant prisms to the underside reflects the light sideways, allowing it to light the area under the main building. The pendant shapes were [[Porro prism|right-angle ("half") prisms]], which [[total internal reflection|reflected all]] incoming light sideways.&lt;ref name=glassian /&gt; The horizontal ridges protruding from the top of the prism let it be set into an opening in an iron or cement grating.

Some cast glass pendant prisms have flat portions to shed light directly below, as well as throwing it sideways under the main body of the building (see image). Some prisms were made with multiple pendant prisms, either as a [[Fresnel lens|Fresnel-lens]]-like [[prism lighting|sheet of identical prisms]] ("multi") or a sheet of dissimilar prisms that could distribute the light ("three-way" etc.).&lt;ref name=shapes /&gt;

The precise angles at which the prisms [[refraction|refracted]] or [[reflection (physics)|reflected]] light was important. An installation would generally consist of multiple different prescriptions of prism, chosen either by an on-site expert contractor or by a layman using standard algorithms.&lt;ref name=handbook /&gt; This also would diffuse the light somewhat, as would the rough glass surfaces (the lenses are [[translucent]], not transparent).

Larger castings are more expensive, not only because they use more glass, but because they take longer [[annealing (glass)|to cool]].&lt;ref name=annealing /&gt; Modern [[glass floor]]s use [[laminated glass|laminate]] sheet glass some centimeters (more than an inch) thick; it often is transparent.&lt;ref name=Campbell-Dollaghan /&gt;

==== Non-glass translucent materials ====
[[Synthetic resin]] composites (such as [[fiberglass]]), as well as plastics such as [[Lexan]], have been proposed to replace missing prism lights.&lt;ref name=daily_astorian /&gt; Translucent decking panels made of fiberglass are often used for [[balconies]] which would otherwise shade the windows below them.&lt;ref name=translucent_decking&gt;{{cite web |url=http://frpresource.com/2017/globalgridtranslucentdecking/ |title=GLOBALGRID™ Translucent Decking |publisher=Frpresource.com |date= |accessdate=2017-11-12 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171113112902/http://frpresource.com/2017/globalgridtranslucentdecking/ |archivedate=2017-11-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; {{see below|gallery}} Peel-and-stick [[prism lighting|prism films]] recently have come on the market, with acrylic micro-prisms that internally reflect light somewhat like glass pendant prisms.&lt;ref name=DoD /&gt;&lt;ref name=OOtM /&gt;&lt;ref name=TIR&gt;{{cite web |url=https://sweets.construction.com/swts_content_files/154130/2263001.pdf |title=SerraGlaze Q&amp;A |publisher=Sweet's Construction Catalog |accessdate=2017-11-16 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20171116084258/https://sweets.construction.com/swts_content_files/154130/2263001.pdf |archivedate=2017-11-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

In some cases, a second vertical curtain of prisms was installed under the [[sill plate|building sill]].&lt;ref name=LuxferCat /&gt; These were analogous to the [[prism lighting|prism transoms]] used over above-ground windows and doors. The light could be bent in two stages and used to daylight the whole basement.&lt;ref name=LuxferCat /&gt;

The areaway under a sidewalk light usually has a masonry wall separating it from the soil under the street, although it may extend partly under the street. Support for the vault light frames varies. Steel cross-beams supported by columns are common in older buildings; metal decks are common in newer ones.&lt;ref name=replacing_structure /&gt;

=== Manufacture, maintenance, and repair ===
Some modern pavement lights are quite different from historic ones,&lt;ref name=Campbell-Dollaghan /&gt;&lt;ref name=glassian /&gt; so restoration and replacement may use different techniques and parts.

A few companies now manufacture and sell vault lights, either as glass-only, prefab panels, or installation.&lt;ref name=recon /&gt;&lt;ref name=current /&gt; Construction methods and prices vary widely.&lt;ref name=current /&gt; Historically, glass lenses were standardized by each manufacturer; some modern manufacturers produce standardized prisms.&lt;ref name=handbook /&gt;&lt;ref name=recon /&gt;&lt;ref name=hargreaves /&gt; Some firms also supply replacement glass castings to order.&lt;ref name=current /&gt; Cost varies greatly; shapes needing complicated articulated [[Molding (process)|moulds]] are more expensive.&lt;ref name=recon /&gt;

Modern [[caulking]] materials are used for caulking in replacement glass. Broken and damaged frames can be patched, re-welded,&lt;ref name=NPS /&gt; or re-cast.&lt;ref name=NPS /&gt;&lt;ref name=hargreaves /&gt; Generally speaking, restoration requires only simple tools and technology.&lt;ref name=NPS /&gt;

Promptly repairing sidewalk cracks, and avoiding [[de-ice]]rs that will corrode metal, helps keep the supporting structure dry and in good repair.&lt;ref name=replacing_structure /&gt; Keeping a sidewalk light watertight does not cost much in time or materials.&lt;ref name=NPS /&gt; Vaults generally last many decades,&lt;ref name=replacing_structure /&gt; and many extant vaults are more than a century old.&lt;ref name=recon /&gt;

=== Reuse and preservation ===
Despite their reusability and repairability, old panels often are landfilled.&lt;ref name=demolition /&gt;&lt;ref name=victoria /&gt;&lt;ref name=recon /&gt; However, the city of [[Victoria, Canada]] is stockpiling removed pavement light panels for future restoration projects.&lt;ref name=victoria /&gt;&lt;ref name=recon /&gt; Often, individual broken sidewalk prisms are not replaced, but instead, the opening is filled with concrete or other opaque materials,&lt;ref name=recon /&gt; such as metal, wood, and asphalt.&lt;ref name=NPS /&gt;

When a building is renovated, vault lights may be removed or concreted over. For instance, the floor of New York's [[Pennsylvania Station (1910–1963)|mostly-demolished old Pennsylvania Station]] was made of vault lights, to let light through the concourse floor onto the platforms.&lt;ref name=images_penn_station /&gt; The undersides of the lights can still be seen, but the tops have been concreted over (see images).&lt;ref&gt;[[:File:Penn NY original floor.jpg|Photo]], 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

While some cities have preservation measures for vault lights, others actively remove them and fill areaways.&lt;ref name=recon /&gt; Sometimes the outside appearance of the lights is retained while filling the areaway and setting the lights in a concrete pad, removing their daylighting function.&lt;ref name=NPS /&gt; Some areaways are "mothballed"; that is, filled with gravel that could later be removed.&lt;ref name=recon /&gt;

Areaways are used in some cities as a convenient place to run utilities, which may make the cities reluctant to give areaways legal protection.&lt;ref name=recon /&gt; In some cases, utility construction leads to areaways being filled.&lt;ref name=statesman /&gt;

=== Problems ===
The load-bearing strength of vault lights varies widely with span, construction, and state of repair. Some damaged vaults may not be able to support a fire engine,&lt;ref name=vanheritage /&gt; which a sidewalk vault in sound condition should be able to do.&lt;ref name=replacing_structure /&gt;

Damp areaways may corrode the steel load-bearing elements supporting the pavement roof. Moisture may come from leakage from above or from groundwater from below.&lt;ref name=recon /&gt;

=== Current installations ===

*'''[[Vancouver]]''', British Columbia has an unofficial policy of requiring any applicants for development permits to fill in areaways,&lt;ref name=vanheritage /&gt;&lt;ref name=recon /&gt; although some have been paved over or made sufficiently load-bearing to support a fire engine.&lt;ref name=vanalogue_gallery /&gt; Some of the remaining areaways have restaurants built into them.&lt;ref name=scout /&gt; A walking map of the sidewalk prisms has been produced.&lt;ref name=map /&gt; There are ~130 remaining areaways, the records of which are not digitised, and no measures exist to promote their preservation.&lt;ref name=recon /&gt;

*'''[[Victoria, B.C.|Victoria]]''', British Columbia has more than eleven thousand sidewalk prisms in seven locations (as of 2006), with more than 670 of them missing or filled with concrete, including an underground gallery running around an entire block outside the Yarrow Building.&lt;ref name=recon /&gt; Sidewalk prisms have been heritage-registered since 1990. Originally, there were hundreds of thousands of prisms. The city has some panels in storage for restoration, but is having difficulty finding a glass supplier. There are city plans to light the galleries below at night, creating glowing purple sidewalks in the downtown core.&lt;ref name=victoria /&gt; While they are protected, there is no funding for the preservation of sidewalk prisms.&lt;ref name=recon /&gt;

In a pin-point analysis, a frame (or a [[transect]]) with a fixed [[grid pattern]] is placed above the vegetation. A pin is inserted vertically through one of the grid points into the vegetation and will typically touch a number of plants. The number of times the pin touches different plant species is then recorded. This procedure is repeated at each grid point. Vertical rulers connected to the frame are used to prevent horizontal drift of the pins and to measure the height of vegetation hit by the pins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Heady|first=Harold F.|last2=Rader|first2=Lynn|date=March 1958|title=Modifications of the Point Frame|url=|journal=Journal of Range Management|volume=11|issue=2|pages=2|doi=10.2307/3894295}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11448">The '''Port Bonython oil spill''' occurred on 30 August 1992, when the fuel tank of the tanker ''Era'' was pierced by the bow of the tugboat ''Turmoil'' during berthing operations in upper [[Spencer Gulf]], [[South Australia]].&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;[https://www.amsa.gov.au/environment/major-historical-incidents/Era/index.asp AMSA: Australian Maritime Safety Authority &gt; Era] ''Australian Maritime Safety Authority'', [[Government of Australia]], Australia. Accessed 2014-02-07.&lt;/ref&gt; Wind and swell were high and 296 tonnes of [[bunker fuel]] were released into Spencer Gulf. The incident resulted in 500 oiled birds and damage to 15&amp;nbsp;km of mangrove and seagrass habitat south-west of [[Port Pirie]].

== Spill ==

=== 30 August ===
[[File:Port Bonython jetty and Santos refinery 2011 by Dan Monceaux.jpg|thumb|Port Bonython, Upper Spencer Gulf]]
The spill occurred at 10.52am, as the ''Era ''was [[berthing]] at the [[Port Bonython]] wharf in rough seas. The vessel had arrived to load oil for the [[Kwinana Refinery|Kwinana refinery]]. The ''Era'' was chartered by [[BP]] and the tugboat involved, ''Turmoil'', was property of the [[Adelaide Steamship Company]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Pearce, Wade "Chemicals attacking 2km slick - Oil spill threat to Gulf animals" ''The Advertiser'', South Australia (1992-08-31).&lt;/ref&gt; Also present were the tugboat ''Taminga'' and the line-boat ''Wanilla''. A lug on the ''Turmoil''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'s bow pierced the hull of the tanker, leaving a 20&amp;nbsp;cm hole in the hull and rupturing her fuel tank. The 94,287 deadweight tonne vessel&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Page, J. R. "Report on the oil spill from the tanker "Era" at Port Bonython and on the pollution response operations" Report No: DMH 1594/1992 ''South Australian State Committee of the National Plan to Combat Pollution of the Sea by Oil ''(1992).&lt;/ref&gt; was listed 5 degrees to slow the flow of heavy [[bunker oil]], and the leak was eventually stopped at 2.12pm.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A total of 296 tonnes of heavy fuel oil had escaped into the sea.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Response ==
The slick was described in the official report as "a moderate sheen with streaks of heavy dark oil moving round the stern of the vessel." Tug boats were driven through the slick in an attempt to break it up, and the spraying of chemical [[dispersant]] commenced soon after the spill occurred. 400 litres of Corexit 7764 and 4200 litres of Corexit 9527 were supplied by [[Santos Limited|Santos]].

The absence of an appropriate crane at the jetty made loading ''Turmoil'' with dispersant at Port Bonython impossible. Instead, the tugboat proceeded to Whyalla to load, while the dispersant was transported there by road. The Santos-owned Shark Cat ''Tregalana'' loaded in Santos' boat harbor. The other vessels present'' ''were unable to assist due to the ''Wanilla'' requiring towing by the ''Taminga.'' A line had fouled its propeller during the berthing of the ''Era''.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Three different chemical dispersants were used: [[Corexit]] 7764, [[Corexit 9527A|Corexit 9527]] and Ardrox 6120.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Strong north-westerly winds of up to 25 knots combined with tide and current initially transported the oil slick eastwards, towards [[Port Germein, South Australia|Port Germein]]. The high winds prevented the early use of [[containment boom]]s.

Assisted by the Department of Environment and Planning, volunteers prepared for the possibility of a 'massive clean-up'.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== 31 August – Day 2 ===

The 20&amp;nbsp;cm hole in the fuel tank of the ''Era'' was temporarily repaired, and the tanker was loaded in preparation to sail for Kwinana, Western Australia in the evening.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Kriven, Sylvia "Slick threat to Port Germein" ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'', South Australia (1992-09-01) Pg.6&lt;/ref&gt; The Department of Marine and Harbors announced that the oil spill posed no threat to wildlife. At this time, only 30 tonnes of oil was left at the sea's surface.&lt;ref&gt;"Oil spillage no threat: Department" ''[[The Whyalla News|Whyalla News]]'', South Australia (1992-09-01).&lt;/ref&gt; The slick was estimated to be dense, 500 m long and 100 m wide.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;Kriven, Sylvia "Rescue plan for victims of oil slick" ''[[The Advertiser (Adelaide)|The Advertiser]]'', South Australia (1992-09-02) Pg.12&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 1 September – Day 3 ===
The ''Era'' departed Port Bonython for Kwinana, Western Australia at 5.30am, laden with 22,990 tonnes of crude oil from the Cooper Basin.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

The spill had attracted national news media attention.&lt;ref&gt;"Editorial Opinion - Grave Reminder" ''[[The Whyalla News|Whyalla News]]'', South Australia (1992-09-01)&lt;/ref&gt; A visible 10-20 tonne slick remained on the water's surface after the majority of the oil had been sprayed with chemical dispersant. The dispersal of the slick involved 50 people, five boats, a helicopter and spotter aircraft.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

25 Special Emergency Services (SES) personnel were placed on standby.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Staff from the [[Australian Marine Oil Spill Centre]] (AMOSC) were present to supervise the use of booms to channel the oil, and some oil was recovered by this method.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; At this time, there had been no reports of dead fish or birds. About 10 volunteers were ready at Port Pirie to handle any oiled wildlife. Council workers were also dispatched from the [[Mount Remarkable, South Australia|Mount Remarkable]] District Council to assist.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Professional fishermen, including the 39-member Spencer Gulf Prawn Fishermen's Association called for an independent inquiry into the incident and a review of all berthing procedures. Spokesperson Mick Puglisi stated that he believed the ''Era ''should never have berthed in such extreme weather.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

A Department of Marine and Harbors spokesman said that it was unlikely that anyone would be charged under the Marine Pollution by Oil and Noxious Substances Act.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

Local pilot Syd Cheesman said that he had seen places where "the oil is on the bottom and the water is on top of it." He also described the slick as covering "an extensive area".&lt;ref&gt;Uren, Kate "Oil slick clean-up continues - Concerns" ''The Recorder'', Port Pirie, South Australia (1992-09-02) Pg.1&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2 September – Day 4 ===

About 10 tonnes of oil had washed into [[Avicennia marina|mangroves]] overnight. A slick 15&amp;nbsp;km long had been seen drifting 1&amp;nbsp;km off Port Pirie. A makeshift animal hospital was established in Port Pirie. Small boats searched at first light for oiled birds.

The visible oil was described by David Gray of the [[Australian Maritime Safety Authority]] as 'a sheen on the water'.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Some of this sheen impacted the mangroves and a number of tidal creeks to the south-west of Port Pirie.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The estimated number of impacted birds was revised from 100 birds to up to 500 birds as the search and recovery efforts began. Rescuers expressed concern about the birds' ingestion of oil as a consequence of [[preening]].&lt;ref&gt;Kriven, Sylvia "Wildlife dies in worst SA oil slick" ''The Advertiser'', South Australia (1992-09-03). Pg.1.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 3 September – Day 5 ===

The oil had settled in the mangroves south-west of Port Pirie. More than 500 birds had now been affected and 20 dead birds had been recorded. Prawn fishermen and Fisheries officers collected samples of prawn larvae and seabed sediment for analysis. Fisherman David Wilks participated in the bird rescue and recovery and described the scene:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"As the tides recede, oil is plastered black all over the mangroves, oil is pouring out of the creeks with the tides and there's a film of oil left behind which is seeping into the seagrass beds."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Teams of volunteers scrubbed oiled birds overnight and prepared them for transport to the [[RSPCA]] in [[Lonsdale, South Australia|Lonsdale]]. Treated birds included [[Australian pelican|pelicans]], [[cormorant]]s, [[grebes]] and [[herons]].&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; More than a dozen dead birds were collected on this day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article126940549 "Rescuers out to save birds from oil slick"] ''The Canberra Times'', Australian Capital Territory (1992-09-04). Retrieved 2013-11-20.&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the dead birds recovered were cormorants. Fauna rescue researcher Ms Erna Walraven was intended to receive the dead birds in Sydney for further study. National Parks and Wildlife put a call out for more flat-bottomed boats and experienced boat operators to assist.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Kriven, Sylvia "Desperate bid to save birds" ''The Advertiser, ''South Australia. (1992-09-03) Pg.2&lt;/ref&gt;

Senior Environment and Planning Department officer Brian Wagstaff said the spill posed no long or medium-term ecological risk. He stated: "There won't be a die-back of mangroves, although there may be some loss of leaves... it's the birds that are the main concern."&lt;ref&gt;"Wildlife dies in Gulf oil slick" ''The Advertiser'', South Australia (1992-09-04).&lt;/ref&gt;

== Impact ==
At the time of the spill, environmental scientist Doug Reilly warned of the risk the slick posed to important breeding grounds of western king prawns. He also raised concerns about the potential threat chemical dispersant could pose to marine ecosystems.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Mangrove and seagrass habitats were impacted, as were native birds and the local fishing industry.

=== Fishing industry ===
10 days after the spill, the South Australian Fishing Industry Council stated that 25 families had lost their income in the short term due to the spill. The Council stated that if the spill was found to have caused long-term damage to fishing grounds, millions of dollars in compensation would be sought from whoever was deemed liable.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article126941631 "Fishers may seek compo for spill income loss"] ''The Canberra Times'', Australian Capital Territory (1992-09-09). Retrieved 2013-11-20.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Responsibility ==
Two inquiries into the incident reached the conclusion that it was an unforeseeable accident for which no-one was to blame.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nla.gov.au/nla.news-article126962913 "Oily absolutions"] ''The Canberra Times'', Australian Capital Territory (1992-12-16).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11508">In [[differential calculus]], the '''Reynolds transport theorem''' (also known as the Leibniz–Reynolds transport theorem), or in short '''Reynolds' theorem''', is a three-dimensional generalization of the [[Leibniz integral rule]] which is also known as [[differentiation under the integral sign]].
The theorem is named after [[Osborne Reynolds]] (1842–1912). It is used to recast derivatives of integrated quantities and is useful in formulating the basic equations of [[continuum mechanics]].

Consider integrating {{math|'''f''' {{=}} '''f'''('''x''',''t'')}} over the time-dependent region {{math|Ω(''t'')}} that has boundary {{math|∂Ω(''t'')}}, then taking the derivative with respect to time:
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}\,dV.&lt;/math&gt;
If we wish to move the derivative within the integral, there are two issues: the time dependence of {{math|'''f'''}}, and the introduction of and removal of space from {{math|Ω}} due to its dynamic boundary. Reynolds' transport theorem provides the necessary framework.

== General form ==
Reynolds' transport theorem can be expressed as follows:&lt;ref name=LGLp23&gt;[[L. Gary Leal|L. G. Leal]], 2007, p. 23.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=OR14&gt;[[Osborne Reynolds|O. Reynolds]], 1903, Vol. 3, p. 12–13&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=MTp23&gt;[[Jerrold E. Marsden|J.E. Marsden]] and [[Anthony Tromba|A. Tromba]], 5th ed. 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}\,dV = \int_{\Omega(t)} \frac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial t}\,dV + \int_{\partial \Omega(t)} \left(\mathbf{v}^b\cdot\mathbf{n}\right)\mathbf{f}\,dA&lt;/math&gt;

in which {{math|'''n'''('''x''',''t'')}} is the outward-pointing unit normal vector, {{math|'''x'''}} is a point in the region and is the variable of integration, {{math|''dV''}} and {{math|''dA''}} are volume and surface elements at {{math|'''x'''}}, and {{math|'''v'''&lt;sup&gt;''b''&lt;/sup&gt;('''x''',''t'')}} is the velocity of the area element (''not'' the flow velocity). The function {{math|'''f'''}} may be tensor-, vector- or scalar-valued.&lt;ref&gt;H. Yamaguchi, ''Engineering Fluid Mechanics, ''Springer c2008 p23&lt;/ref&gt; Note that the integral on the left hand side is a function solely of time, and so the total derivative has been used.

== Form for a material element ==
In continuum mechanics, this theorem is often used for [[material element]]s.  These are parcels of fluids or solids which no material enters or leaves. If {{math|Ω(''t'')}} is a material element then there is a velocity function {{math|'''v''' {{=}} '''v'''('''x''',''t'')}}, and the boundary elements obey
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{v}^{b}\cdot\mathbf{n}=\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{n}.&lt;/math&gt;
This condition may be substituted to obtain:&lt;ref name=BLM&gt;[[Ted Belytschko|T. Belytschko]], W. K. Liu, and B. Moran, 2000, '' Nonlinear Finite Elements for Continua and Structures'', John Wiley and Sons, Ltd., New York.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\left(\int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}\,dV\right) = \int_{\Omega(t)} \frac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial t}\,dV + \int_{\partial \Omega(t)} (\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{n})\mathbf{f}\,dA.&lt;/math&gt;

!Proof for a material element
|-
|
Let {{math|Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} be reference configuration of the region {{math|Ω(''t'')}}. Let
the motion and the [[deformation gradient]] be given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{x} = \boldsymbol{\varphi}(\mathbf{X}, t),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{F}(\mathbf{X},t) = \boldsymbol{\nabla}\boldsymbol{\varphi}.&lt;/math&gt;

Let {{math|''J''('''X''',''t'') {{=}} det '''''F'''''('''X''',''t'')}}. Define
:&lt;math&gt;\hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X}, t) = \mathbf{f}(\boldsymbol{\varphi}(\mathbf{X}, t), t).&lt;/math&gt;
Then the integrals in the current and the reference configurations are related by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,dV &amp;= \int_{\Omega_0} \mathbf{f}(\boldsymbol{\varphi}(\mathbf{X},t),t)\, J(\mathbf{X},t) \,dV_0 \\
&amp;= \int_{\Omega_0} \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\, J(\mathbf{X},t)\,dV_0.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

That this derivation is for a material element is implicit in the time constancy of the reference configuration: it is constant in material coordinates. The time derivative of an integral over a volume is defined as

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,dV\right) = \lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\Delta t} \left(\int_{\Omega(t + \Delta t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t+\Delta t)\,dV - \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,dV\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Converting into integrals over the reference configuration, we get

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt} \left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t) \, dV\right) = 
\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{1}{\Delta t} \left(\int_{\Omega_0} \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t+\Delta t)\, J(\mathbf{X},t+\Delta t)\,dV_0 - \int_{\Omega_0} \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\, J(\mathbf{X},t)\, dV_0\right).&lt;/math&gt;

Since {{math|Ω&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;}} is independent of time, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt}\left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,dV\right)
&amp;= \int_{\Omega_0} \left(\lim_{\Delta t \rightarrow 0} \frac{ \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t+\Delta t)\, J(\mathbf{X},t+\Delta t) - \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\, J(\mathbf{X},t)}{\Delta t} \right)\,dV_0 \\
&amp;= \int_{\Omega_0} \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\, J(\mathbf{X},t)\right)\,dV_0 \\
&amp;= \int_{\Omega_0} \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\big(\hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\big)\, J(\mathbf{X},t)+ \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\,\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\big(J(\mathbf{X},t)\big)\right) \,dV_0. \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

The time derivative of {{mvar|'''F'''}} is given by:
&lt;ref name=Gurtin&gt;[[Morton Gurtin|Gurtin M. E.]], 1981, ''An Introduction to Continuum Mechanics''. Academic Press, New York, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{\partial J(\mathbf{X},t)}{\partial t} = \frac{\partial}{\partial t}(\det\boldsymbol{F}) &amp;= (\det\boldsymbol{F})(\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}) \\
&amp;= J(\mathbf{X},t)\,\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}\big(\boldsymbol{\varphi}(\mathbf{X},t),t\big) \\
&amp;= J(\mathbf{X},t)\,\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t). \end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt}\left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,dV\right)
&amp;= \int_{\Omega_0} \left( \frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\right)\,J(\mathbf{X},t)+ \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\,J(\mathbf{X},t)\,\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)\right) \,dV_0 \\
&amp;= \int_{\Omega_0} \left(\frac{\partial}{\partial t}\left(\hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\right)+ \hat{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{X},t)\,\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)\right)\,J(\mathbf{X},t) \,dV_0 \\
&amp;= \int_{\Omega(t)} \left(\dot{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{x},t)+ \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)\right)\,dV.
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{f}}&lt;/math&gt; is the [[material time derivative]] of {{math|'''f'''}}. The material derivative is given by
:&lt;math&gt;\dot{\mathbf{f}}(\mathbf{x},t) = \frac{\partial \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)}{\partial t} + \big(\boldsymbol{\nabla} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\big)\cdot\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t).&lt;/math&gt;

Therefore,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,dV\right) =
\int_{\Omega(t)} \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)}{\partial t} + \big(\boldsymbol{\nabla} \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\big)\cdot\mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t) + \mathbf{f}(\mathbf{x},t)\,\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}(\mathbf{x},t)\right)\,dV,&lt;/math&gt;

or,

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}\,dV\right)
= \int_{\Omega(t)} \left( \frac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{\nabla} \mathbf{f}\cdot\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{f}\,\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{v}\right)\,dV.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the identity

:&lt;math&gt;\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot (\mathbf{v}\otimes\mathbf{w}) = \mathbf{v}(\boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot \mathbf{w}) + \boldsymbol{\nabla}\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{w},&lt;/math&gt;

we then have

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}\,dV\right)
= \int_{\Omega(t)} \left(\frac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial t} + \boldsymbol{\nabla} \cdot (\mathbf{f}\otimes\mathbf{v})\right)\,dV.&lt;/math&gt;

Using the [[divergence theorem]] and the identity {{math|('''a''' ⊗ '''b''') · '''n''' {{=}} ('''b''' · '''n''')'''a'''}}, we have

:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
\frac{d}{dt}\left( \int_{\Omega(t)} \mathbf{f}\,dV\right)
&amp;= \int_{\Omega(t)}\frac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial t}\,dV + \int_{\partial \Omega(t)}(\mathbf{f}\otimes\mathbf{v})\cdot\mathbf{n}\,dA \\
&amp;= \int_{\Omega(t)}\frac{\partial \mathbf{f}}{\partial t}\,dV + \int_{\partial \Omega(t)}(\mathbf{v}\cdot\mathbf{n})\mathbf{f}\,dA. \qquad \square
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;
|}

== A special case ==
If we take {{math|Ω}} to be constant with respect to time, then {{math|'''v'''&lt;sub&gt;''b''&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} 0}} and the identity reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\int_{\Omega} f\,dV = \int_{\Omega} \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\,dV.&lt;/math&gt;

as expected. (This simplification is not possible if the flow velocity is incorrectly used in place of the velocity of an area element.)

=== Interpretation and reduction to one dimension ===
The theorem is the higher-dimensional extension of [[differentiation under the integral sign]] and reduces to that expression in some cases. Suppose {{mvar|f}} is independent of {{mvar|y}} and {{mvar|z}}, and that {{math|Ω(''t'')}} is a unit square in the {{mvar|yz}}-plane and has {{mvar|x}} limits {{math|''a''(''t'')}} and {{math|''b''(''t'')}}. Then Reynolds transport theorem reduces to

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{d}{dt}\int_{a(t)}^{b(t)} f(x,t)\,dx = \int_{a(t)}^{b(t)} \frac{\partial f}{\partial t}\,dx + \frac{\partial b(t)}{\partial t} f\big(b(t),t\big) - \frac{\partial a(t)}{\partial t} f\big(a(t),t\big) \,,&lt;/math&gt;

which, up to swapping {{mvar|x}} and {{mvar|t}}, is the standard expression for differentiation under the integral sign.

The '''rummy-nose tetra''' (''Hemigrammus rhodostomus'') is a species of [[tropical]] [[freshwater]] [[Characidae|characin]] fish originating in [[South America]], popular among fishkeepers as an [[aquarium]] fish. One of many small [[tetra]]s belonging to the same genus, it is on average 5&amp;nbsp;cm (2&amp;nbsp;in) long when fully grown, and is a long established favourite among tropical fishkeepers. The fish is one of several very similar species including ''[[Hemigrammus bleheri]]'', and ''[[Petitella georgiae]]'', and it is possible that more recently collected specimens available in the aquarium trade are members of one or other of these similar species. The common name applied to most of these fishes is "rummy-nose tetra", though other common names are in circulation (such as "firehead tetra" for ''H. bleheri'', according to [[FishBase]]).

==Physical description==

The rummy-nose tetra is a torpedo-shaped fish, whose basal body colour is a translucent silvery colour suffused in some specimens with a greenish tint: iridescent green scales are frequently seen adorning the fish at the point where the fontanel (a part of the head roughly corresponding to the forehead in humans) meets the body. The fins are hyaline, with the exception of the tail fin, this fin being adorned with black and white horizontal stripes, variable in number, but usually comprising one central black stripe in the central portion of the tail fin, with two horizontal black stripes upon each caudal fin lobe, the spaces between the stripes being white, the total count of black stripes being five. The head is a deep red colour, iridescent in lustre, with the red continuing into the iris of the eye, and some red colouration extends beyond the operculum or gill plate into the anteriormost section of the body proper. Some specimens classified as ''Hemigrammus rhodostomus'' possess three black tail stripes instead of five, and some specimens classified as ''Petitella georgiae'' have a black stripe in the caudal peduncle extending forwards into the body, surmounted above by a thin iridescent gold line: however, whether these features are reliable determinants of species identity has yet to be fully ascertained.

Male and female individuals exhibit no obvious visual differences, other than increased fullness of the body outline in ripe females.

==Distribution==
[[Image:Brilliant rummy nose.jpg|thumb|right|''Hemigrammus bleheri'']]
The three different species of fish thus known as rummy-nose tetras have the following distributions:

:''Hemigrammus rhodostomus'' : Lower Amazon basin and Orinoco River (which was discovered after WWI by the German Albert Ramsperger)
:''[[Hemigrammus bleheri]]'': Rio Negro and Rio Meta basins (photo shown here is that of a group of'' H. bleheri'' which was discovered by Heiko Bleher in 1965)
:''[[Petitella georgiae]]'': Upper Amazon basin in Peru, Rio Purus, Rio Negro and Rio Madeira basins (which has been found in an aquarium fish import from Peru in the late 1950s in Switzerland by H. Boutiere).

==Habitat==

All three species of rummy-nose tetra inhabit river stretches whose water chemistry is mineral-deficient (soft), acidic, and frequently tainted with humic acid decay products from leaf litter upon the river substrates (known as 'blackwaters' because of their appearance). Aquatic plants are sometimes present in these stretches of water, though the upper reaches of the Rio Negro are less densely populated with aquatic flora than the other rivers due to shading from the rainforest canopy. The fishes preferentially inhabit the middle and mid-lower water regions.

==Aquarium maintenance==

The details of aquarium maintenance for all three species are more or less identical: the rummy-nose tetra is a schooling fish, which exhibits tight schooling behaviour both in the wild and in the aquarium. Consequently, these fishes should be maintained in groups of no fewer than six individuals, with larger numbers being preferable where space permits-these tetras preferring about a 25 gallon/80 litre aquarium. All three species are lovers of warm aquarium water, the temperature range for maintenance being 24&amp;nbsp;°C to 31&amp;nbsp;°C, with the fishes sometimes requiring temperatures as high as 33&amp;nbsp;°C for breeding. Consequently, compatibility of these fishes with cooler water fishes is contra-indicated: for example, [[panda corydoras]] would be a bad choice of companion as these fishes prefer lower temperatures, and there is little overlap in the temperature ranges of the two species. Many fish can be kept with rummy-nose tetras, some including smaller [[gourami]], tetras, [[Barb (fish)|barbs]], [[danios]], Australian rainbows, and various catfish, such as [[Ancistrus]]. These fish cannot be kept with African cichlids as they have very different water parameters.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The water chemistry preferred by these fishes, as might be inferred readily from that of the wild habitat, is soft, acidic water (hardness no higher than 6° [[DGH|dH]] and [[pH]] around 6.4–7.0 is ''definitely'' preferred if possible) though for maintenance purposes, the pH of the aquarium water can range from 5.6 to 7.4. However, if captive reproduction is to be attempted, the rummy-nose tetra ''needs'' soft, acidic water, as ''Tropical Fish Hobbyist'' magazine recently reported that research work upon these fishes indicates that high levels of calcium ions in the water induce sterility in these fishes.{{citation needed|date=January 2018}} A planted aquarium is welcomed by these fishes, particularly if the plants include fine-leaved species such as ''[[Cabomba]]'' and ''[[Myriophyllum]]''.

Feeding presents relatively few problems, as the fishes will eagerly devour a range of prepared as well as live fish foods. In common with numerous other tetras, these fishes are particularly fond of live [[Chironomidae#Behavior and description|bloodworm]]s (these are the aquatic larvae of a midge belonging to the genus ''Chironomus'') and will also devour live ''[[Daphnia]]'' avidly. Unlike those tetra species which adapt to surface feeding in the aquarium, rummy-nose tetras are not considered likely to add live mosquito larvae to their diet in the aquarium, though instances where these fishes discover and enjoy this food are possible: usually, rummy-nose tetras prefer to take their foods in the middle and lower regions of the aquarium.

Lifespan for the rummy-nose tetra in the aquarium is usually 5 to 6 years with careful maintenance. Exceptional specimens can live for more than 8 years.

The fish is interesting in that it can act as a "mine canary" in an aquarium, alerting the aquarist to potential pollution problems in an aquarium. When levels of certain metabolic wastes (ammonia, nitrites and nitrates) exceed critical levels, the intense ruby-red colour of the fish's facial area becomes pale. The fishes also become pale in appearance immediately after the disturbance that takes place in the aquarium following a water change, but in this instance, once clean water has been supplied, the intense deep red colour returns. ''Persistent'' paleness of the head is to be taken as a sign that water chemistry parameters in the maintenance aquarium are in need of adjustment, and that pollutant levels are becoming dangerous for the inhabitants.

==Reproduction==

Rummy-nose tetras present serious challenges even to experienced aquarists from the standpoint of breeding, primarily due to two factors: the likelihood of sterility ensuing if the prospective parents are maintained in water with too high a level of dissolved calcium ions, and the slow growth rate of the fry. An additional problem is that gender differentiation is difficult by visual inspection alone, making pair selection partly a matter of luck unless an obviously gravid female is available for selection. Again, identical remarks apply to all three species listed above.

The breeding aquarium for the rummy-nose tetra, in addition, needs to be sterilised prior to use, as the fish produces eggs that are notoriously sensitive to bacterial and fungal infection. Use of an antifungal agent is strongly advised once spawning is completed in order to prevent various fungi from attacking the eggs.

Needless to say, given the above remarks about likely sterility if the fishes are maintained in water whose chemical parameters are incorrect, prospective parents ''must'' be maintained in soft, acidic water throughout their lives if they are to remain capable of reproduction. Failure to do so will destroy any chances of success from the very start. Furthermore, it is highly advisable to filter the water of the breeding aquarium over peat, or alternatively use one of the commercially available 'Blackwater Tonic' additives to provide the necessary chemical environment conducive to reproduction. Parent fishes should, in addition, be conditioned heavily with copious live foods to bring them into prime breeding condition.

Though the fishes prefer to spawn among fine leaved plants, one problem that the aquarist faces in this regard is that the majority of fine leaved plants available in the aquarium prefer high light levels (''Cabomba'' is a particular case in point) while the rummy-nose tetra prefers to spawn under subdued lighting conditions. Workarounds for this include the use of [[Java moss]] (a plant that thrives even in very low light levels, and is an ideal spawning medium for many fishes) or the use of synthetic alternatives ("spawning mops" made of nylon are typically deployed where a suitable natural plant is unavailable).

The parents should be introduced to the breeding aquarium up to 7 days before spawning, fed heavily with live foods, and kept under subdued lighting. In addition, the parents tend to prefer to spawn under quiet conditions, and thus the aquarium should be sited away from areas of busy human traffic. The temperature should be slowly raised to 32&amp;nbsp;°C, and sometimes 33&amp;nbsp;°C may be needed depending upon the individual specimens. Spawning is difficult to observe, taking place as it does under subdued lighting, and while chase sequences followed by the adoption of a side-by-side position by the parents amid the provided spawning media may be taken as indication that spawning is indeed taking place, this is by no means certain. The judicious use of a low-power flashlight to observe spawning may be helpful in determining if eggs are actually being produced.

The species is not noted as a particularly egregious egg eater (unlike, for example, the [[lemon tetra]]—see that article for notes on egg-eating behaviour in [[characin]]s) but it is still advisable to remove the parents once spawning is completed. At this stage, antifungal agents to protect the eggs should be added, and indeed are vital in the case of this difficult, sensitive species.

Once spawning is completed, it is advisable to keep the aquarium under dim lighting conditions until the eggs have hatched and the fry are free-swimming. While rummy-nose tetras do not need their eggs to be kept in total darkness as is the case for [[neon tetra|neon]] and [[cardinal tetra]]s, the eggs are known to exhibit some degree of photosensitivity, and subdued lighting is highly advisable during egg development in the breeding aquarium.

==Development==

Fertile rummy-nose tetra [[Egg (biology)#Fish eggs|eggs]] take approximately 72 to 96 hours to hatch at 32&amp;nbsp;°C. The fry spend a further 24 to 48 hours absorbing the yolk sac, whereupon they become free-swimming. At this stage, the fry should be fed with infusoria or a special egglayer fry food, and frequent partial water changes (around 10% of the aquarium volume every 24 to 48 hours) initiated.

Having overcome the challenge of persuading the fishes to spawn, the aquarist soon discovers that the rummy-nose tetra presents another hurdle to successful captive reproduction—the fry are among the slowest growing of ''all'' characins, and indeed among the slowest-growing of all popular aquarium fishes. Infusoria and other similar foods are required for the fry for a ''minimum'' of three weeks, and it is not unknown for the fishes to take as long as ''twelve weeks'' to migrate to larger foods, growth rates being particularly sensitive to temperature. Success at raising fry to a size where they are capable of taking larger food morsels is much more likely to be achieved if the fry are kept at temperatures above 30&amp;nbsp;°C for the first 3 months of life: even then, attrition rates due to the appearance of diseases among the fishes (most frequently bacterial infections) can be severe.

It can take as long as 6 months to raise fry to juvenile sizes where they are capable of eating live daphnia on a regular basis. During this time, they are likely to be sensitive to sudden changes in water chemistry, and managing pollutants in the fry aquarium is made all the more difficult by the need to maintain low mineral content in the aquarium water during development in order to prevent sterility affecting the fishes—the buffering capacity of the aquarium is likely to be low as a result of the low concentration of bicarbonate ions that is needed in addition to the low concentration of calcium ions. Taking all of these factors into account, the fish is a major breeding challenge for the aquarist, and success may depend at least partly upon luck.

== Summaries in the media ==
According to David Templeton of the [[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]], the program "walks the viewer through the science of how [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] work, returning to that theme time and again to explain variations in design to create cheaper, safer, longer-lasting batteries and [[Energy storage|energy-storage systems]]."&lt;ref name="PPG-20170131"&gt;{{cite news |last=Templeton |first=David |title=NOVA's special episode on batteries includes Carnegie Mellon University technology |url=http://www.post-gazette.com/news/science/2017/01/31/NOVA-s-special-episode-on-batteries-includes-Carnegie-Mellon-University-technology/stories/201701310083 |date=January 31, 2017 |work=[[Pittsburgh Post-Gazette]] |accessdate=February 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Notable discoveries, featured in the program, Templeton reports, are a safe battery "made with [[Saline water|saltwater]] [[electrolytes]]", as well as a safe battery "made of [[plastic]]s that can use [[Lithium|lithium metal]] rather than a traditional [[lithium-ion|lithium ion]] to produce longer-lasting, safe power."&lt;ref name="PPG-20170131"/&gt; Vicky Hallet of the [[Washington Post]] writes that [[Lithium-ion battery|lithium-ion batteries]] "gained widespread popularity because of their ability to pack a lot of energy into a lightweight package." However, such batteries - due to the [[Thermal runaway#Batteries|thermal runaway]] properties of the varieties of lithium-content rechargeable cells that use [[lithium cobalt oxide]] in their positive electrodes - can potentially burst into flames. The program shows several possible ways to make batteries safer.&lt;ref name="WP-20170130"&gt;{{cite news |last=Hallet |first=Vicky |title=The search for a battery that won’t blow up in your face |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/health-science/the-search-for-a-battery-that-wont-blow-up-in-your-face/2017/01/27/3da59032-e249-11e6-a453-19ec4b3d09ba_story.html |date=January 30, 2017 |work=[[Washington Post]] |accessdate=February 3, 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hallet reports that the program presents an important notion: "Batteries are evolving to do more, and do it safely. It’s powerful stuff."&lt;ref name="WP-20170130" /&gt;

'''Shidao Bay Nuclear Power Plant''' ({{zh|s=石岛湾核电厂|t=石島灣核電廠|p=Shídǎo wān hédiàn chǎng}}), commonly known as '''Shidaowan''', is a [[nuclear power plant]] in [[Shandong]] province, China. The site is located near the Xiqianjia village in Ningjin subdistrict, [[Rongcheng, Shandong|Rongcheng]], [[Weihai]], Shandong. The plant is located about {{convert|23|km}} south of Rongcheng City, {{convert|14|km}} northwest of Shidao, and {{convert|68|km}} southeast of Weihai City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.fhdigz.com/en/project_detail.php?id=76 | title= Marine Works of Shidao Bay Nuclear Power Plant| date= May 5, 2014 | work= CCCC-FHDI Engineering | publisher=  | accessdate= 2014-07-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant will have the first [[Generation IV reactor|fourth-generation]] nuclear reactors in the world: the HTR-PM, a [[high-temperature gas-cooled reactor]] (HTGR) concept. The plant will ultimately have ten 210&amp;nbsp;MW&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; ([[MWe|megawatts electrical]]) units of this type. Each unit is made of two HTR-PM reactors driving a single 210&amp;nbsp;MW&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; steam turbine.

The plant will also host the construction of two 1,500&amp;nbsp;MW&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; [[CAP1400]] [[pressurized water reactor]]s, a design based on the [[AP1000]]&lt;ref&gt;John A. Mathews; Hao Tan; O'Faircheallaigh (13 August 2015). China’s Renewable Energy Revolution. Palgrave Macmillan UK. pp. 55–. {{ISBN|978-1-137-54625-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt; jointly developed by [[Westinghouse Electric Company|Westinghouse]] and the [[State Nuclear Power Technology Corporation]] (SNPTC).

Shidao Bay nuclear power plant is a joint venture by [[China Huaneng Group]], [[Nuclear power in China|China Nuclear Engineering &amp; Construction Group]], and [[Tsinghua University]]. The total investment of 100&amp;nbsp;billion [[Chinese yuan|yuan]] (US$15.7&amp;nbsp;billion) and the 20-year construction plan makes it China's largest planned nuclear project.

==HTR-PM==
{{main|HTR-PM}}
In 2005, China announced its intention to scale up the [[HTR-10]] experimental reactor for commercial power generation. 
The first two 250-MWt High-Temperature Reactor-Pebble-bed Modules (HTR-PM) will be installed at Shidao Bay, and together drive a [[steam turbine]] generating 200 [[MWe]].

Originally to be started in 2011, the project was postponed after the [[Fukushima Daiichi nuclear disaster|incident]] at [[Fukushima Daiichi Nuclear Power Plant]] in [[Japan]] in March 2011. 
In 2009, it was planned to be finished in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | doi = 10.1016/j.nucengdes.2009.02.023 | volume=239 | title=Current status and technical description of Chinese 2×250MWth HTR-PM demonstration plant | journal=Nuclear Engineering and Design | pages=1212–1219}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Reciprocating engine]] cylinders are often classified by whether they are single- or double-acting, depending on how the working fluid acts on the piston.

== Single-acting ==
A '''single-acting cylinder''' in a [[reciprocating engine]] is a [[cylinder (engine)|cylinder]] in which the [[working fluid]] acts on one side of the [[piston]] only. A single-acting cylinder relies on the load, springs, other cylinders, or the momentum of a [[flywheel]], to push the piston back in the other direction. Single-acting cylinders are found in most kinds of reciprocating engine. They are almost universal in [[internal combustion engine]]s (e.g. [[petrol engine|petrol]] and [[diesel engine]]s) and are also used in many [[external combustion engine]]s such as [[Stirling engine]]s and some [[steam engine]]s. They are also found in pumps and [[hydraulic cylinder|hydraulic ram]]s.

== Double-acting ==
[[File:Buffalo horizontal steam engine (New Catechism of the Steam Engine, 1904).jpg|thumb|Typical horizontal steam engine with double-acting cylinder]]
A '''double-acting cylinder''' is a cylinder in which the working fluid acts alternately on both sides of the piston. In order to connect the piston in a double-acting cylinder to an external mechanism, such as a [[crank shaft]], a hole must be provided in one end of the cylinder for the piston rod, and this is fitted with a [[gland (engineering)|gland]] or "[[stuffing box]]" to prevent escape of the working fluid. Double-acting cylinders are common in [[steam engine]]s but unusual in other engine types. Many hydraulic and pneumatic cylinders use them where it is needed to produce a force in both directions. A double-acting hydraulic cylinder has a port at each end, supplied with hydraulic fluid for both the retraction and extension of the piston. A double-acting cylinder is used where an external force is not available to retract the piston or it can be used where high force is required in both directions of travel.

== Steam engines ==
[[File:Westinghouse high-speed single-acting compound engine (Rankin Kennedy, Electrical Installations, Vol III, 1903).jpg|thumb|Westinghouse single-acting [[high-speed steam engine]]]]
[[file:Single Acting Oscillating cylinder steam engine.gif|thumb|Single-acting oscillating-cylinder steam engine]]
[[Steam engine]]s normally use double-acting cylinders. However, early steam engines, such as [[atmospheric engine]]s and some [[beam engine]]s were single-acting. These often transmitted their force through the [[beam (beam engine)|beam]] by means of chains and an "arch head", as only a tension in one direction was needed.

Where these were used for pumping mine shafts and only had to act against a load in one direction, single-acting designs remained in use for many years. The main impetus towards double-acting cylinders came when [[James Watt]] was trying to develop a [[rotative beam engine]], that could be used to drive machinery via an output shaft.&lt;ref  &gt;{{book-Hills-Power from Steam|pages=63, 66 }}&lt;/ref&gt; With a single-cylinder engine, a double-acting cylinder gave a smoother power output. The high-pressure engine,{{efn-lr|The pressure of around {{convert|30|psi|bar|0|abbr=on}} was low by today's standard and only "high" in comparison to Watt engines.}} as developed by [[Richard Trevithick]], used double-acting pistons and became the model for most steam engines afterwards.

Some of the later steam engines, the [[high-speed steam engine]]s, used single-acting pistons of a new design. The [[crosshead]] became part of the piston,{{efn-lr|This [[trunk piston]] is familiar from internal combustion engines today.}} and there was no longer any piston rod. This was for similar reasons to the internal combustion engine, as avoiding the piston rod and its seals allowed a more effective [[crankcase]] lubrication system.

Small models and toys often use single-acting cylinders for the above reason but also to reduce manufacturing costs.

== Internal combustion engines ==
[[File:Internal_combustion_engine_pistons_of_partial_cross-sectional_view.jpg|thumb|upright|Single-acting pistons of a typical modern diesel car engine]]
In contrast to steam engines, nearly all [[internal combustion piston engine|internal combustion engine]]s have used single-acting cylinders.

Their pistons are usually [[trunk piston]]s, where the gudgeon pin joint of the connecting rod is within the piston itself. This avoids the crosshead, piston rod and its sealing gland, but it also makes a single-acting piston almost essential. This, in turn, has the advantage of allowing easy access to the bottom of the piston for lubricating oil, which also has an important cooling function. This avoids local overheating of the piston and rings.

=== Crankcase compression two-stroke engines ===
Small petrol [[two-stroke engine]]s, such as for motorcycles, use [[crankcase compression two-stroke engine|crankcase compression]] rather than a separate supercharger or [[scavenge blower]]. This uses both sides of the piston as working faces, the lower side of the piston acting as a piston compressor to compress the inlet charge ready for the next stroke. The piston is still considered as single-acting, as only one of these faces ''produces'' power.

=== Double-acting internal combustion engines ===
[[File:Körting gas engine (Rankin Kennedy, Electrical Installations, Vol III, 1903).jpg|thumb|[[Körting Hannover|Körting]] double-acting gas engine]]
Some early [[gas engine]]s, such as [[Étienne Lenoir|Lenoir]]'s original engines, from around 1860, were double-acting and followed [[stationary steam engine|steam engine]]s in their design.

Internal combustion engines soon switched to single-acting cylinders. This was for two reasons: as for the high-speed steam engine, the high force on each piston and its connecting rod was so great that it placed large demands upon the bearings. A single-acting piston, where the direction of the forces was consistently compressive along the connecting rod, allowed for tighter bearing clearances.&lt;ref name="Hawkins, New Catechism of the Steam Engine" &gt;{{cite book

  |pages=110–113
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Secondly the need for large valve areas to provide good gas flow, whilst requiring a small volume for the combustion chamber so as to provide good [[compression ratio|compression]], monopolised the space available in the [[cylinder head]]. Lenoir's steam engine-derived cylinder was inadequate for the [[petrol engine]] and so a new design, based around [[poppet valve]]s and a single-acting [[trunk piston]] appeared instead.

[[File:Körting gas engine cylinder, section (Rankin Kennedy, Electrical Installations, Vol III, 1903).jpg|thumb|[[Körting Hannover|Körting]] gas engine, section]]
Extremely large gas engines were also built as [[blowing engine]]s for [[blast furnace]]s, with one or two extremely large cylinders and powered by the burning of [[blast furnace gas|furnace gas]]. These, particularly those built by [[Körting Hannover|Körting]], used double-acting cylinders. Gas engines require little or no compression of their charge, in comparison to petrol or [[compression-ignition engine]]s, and so the double-acting cylinder designs were still adequate, despite their narrow, convoluted passageways.

Double-acting cylinders have been infrequently used for internal combustion engines since, although [[Burmeister &amp; Wain]] made 2-stroke cycle double-acting (2-SCDA) diesels for marine propulsion before 1930. The first, of 7,000&amp;nbsp;hp, was fitted in the British MV ''Amerika'' (United Baltic Co.) in 1929.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Image:Staged combustion rocket cycle.png|thumb|right|250px|Fuel-rich staged combustion cycle. Here, all of the fuel and a portion of the oxidizer are fed through the preburner, generating fuel-rich gas. After being run through a turbine to power the pumps, the gas is injected into the combustion chamber and burned with the remaining oxidizer.]]

The '''staged combustion cycle''' (sometimes known as '''topping cycle''' or '''preburner cycle''') is a [[Liquid-propellant rocket#Engine cycles|power cycle]] of a [[bipropellant rocket]] [[Rocket engine|engine]]. In the staged combustion cycle, propellant flows through multiple [[Rocket engine#Combustion chamber|combustion chambers]], and is thus [[combustion|combusted]] in stages. The main advantage relative to other rocket engine power cycles is high [[fuel efficiency]], measured through [[specific impulse]], while its main disadvantage is [[reliability engineering|engineering complexity]].

Typically, propellant flows through two kinds of combustion chambers; the first called ''preburner'' and the second called ''main combustion chamber''. In the preburner, a small portion of propellant is combusted, and the over-pressure produced is used to drive the [[turbopump]]s that feed the engine with propellant. In the main combustion chamber, the propellants are combusted completely to produce [[rocket#Physics|thrust]].

The fuel efficiency of the staged combustion cycle is in part a result of all propellant ultimately flowing to the main combustion chamber; contributing to thrust. The staged combustion cycle is sometimes referred to as '''closed cycle''', as opposed to the [[gas-generator cycle|gas generator, or open cycle]] where a portion of propellant never reaches the main combustion chamber. The engineering complexity is partly a result of the preburner exhaust of hot and highly pressurized gas which, particularly when oxidizer-rich, produces extremely harsh conditions for turbines and plumbing.

==History==
Staged combustion (''{{lang|ru|Замкнутая схема}}'') was first proposed by [[Aleksei Mihailovich Isaev|Alexey Isaev]] in 1949.  The first staged combustion engine was the [[S1.5400]] (11D33) used in the Soviet planetary rocket, designed by Melnikov, a former assistant to Isaev.&lt;ref name=1st_re &gt;George Sutton, "History of Liquid Propellant Rocket Engines", 2006&lt;/ref&gt;  About the same time (1959), [[Nikolai Dmitriyevich Kuznetsov|Nikolai Kuznetsov]] began work on the closed cycle engine [[NK-9]] for Korolev's orbital ICBM, GR-1.  Kuznetsov later evolved that design into the [[NK-15]] and [[NK-33]] engines for the unsuccessful Lunar [[N1 rocket]].
The non-cryogenic [[Dinitrogen tetroxide|N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]]/[[Unsymmetrical dimethylhydrazine|UDMH]] engine [[RD-253]] using staged combustion was developed by [[Valentin Glushko]] circa 1963 for the [[Proton rocket]].

After the abandonment of the [[N1 (rocket)|N-1]], Kuznetsov was ordered to destroy the NK-33 technology, but instead he warehoused dozens of the engines. In the 1990s, [[Aerojet]] was contacted and eventually visited Kuznetsov's plant. Upon meeting initial skepticism about the high specific impulse and other specifications, Kuznetsov shipped an engine to the US for testing.  Oxidizer-rich staged combustion had been considered by American engineers, but deemed impossible.&lt;ref&gt;''Cosmodrome'' History Channel, interviews with Aerojet and Kuznetsov engineers about the history of staged combustion&lt;/ref&gt;
The Russian [[RD-180]] engine also employs a staged-combustion rocket engine cycle. [[Lockheed Martin]] began purchasing the RD-180 in circa 2000 for the [[Atlas III rocket|Atlas III]] and later, the [[Atlas V rocket|V]], rockets. The purchase contract was subsequently taken over by [[United Launch Alliance]] (ULA), the Lockheed-Martin successor company after 2006, and ULA continues to fly the Atlas V with RD-180 engines as of 2018.

The first laboratory staged-combustion test engine in the West was built in Germany in 1963, by [[Ludwig Boelkow]].{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

[[Hydrogen peroxide]]/[[kerosene]] fueled engines such as the British [[Gamma (Rocket engine)|Gamma]] of the 1950s may use a closed-cycle process by catalytically decomposing the peroxide to drive turbines ''before'' combustion with the kerosene in the combustion chamber proper. This gives the efficiency advantages of staged combustion, while avoiding major engineering problems.

The [[Space Shuttle Main Engine]] is another example of a staged combustion engine, and the first to use liquid oxygen and liquid hydrogen.{{citation needed|date=January 2014}}  Its counterpart in the Soviet shuttle was the [[RD-0120]], similar in [[specific impulse]], thrust, and chamber pressure specification to the SSME, but with some differences that reduced complexity and cost at the expense of increased engine weight.

==Variants==
Several variants of the staged combustion cycle exist. Preburners that burn a small portion of oxidizer with a full flow of fuel are called ''fuel-rich'', while preburners that burn a small portion of fuel with a full flow of oxidizer are called ''oxidizer-rich''. The RD-180 has an oxidizer-rich preburner, while the RS-25 has two fuel-rich preburners. The [[SpaceX]] [[Raptor (rocket engine family)|Raptor]] has both oxidizer-rich and fuel-rich preburners, a design called ''full-flow staged combustion''.

Staged combustion designs can be either ''single-shaft'' or ''twin-shaft''. In the single-shaft design, one set of preburner and turbine drives both propellant turbopumps. Examples include the [[NPO Energomash|Energomash]] [[RD-180]] and the [[Blue Origin]] [[BE-4]]. In the twin-shaft design, the two propellant turbopumps are driven by separate turbines, which are in turn driven by the outflow of either one or separate preburners. Examples of twin-shaft designs include the [[Rocketdyne]] [[RS-25]], the [[JAXA]] [[LE-7]], and the Raptor. Relative to a single-shaft design, the twin-shaft design requires an additional set of preburner and turbine, but allows for individual control of the two turbopumps.

In addition to the propellant turbopumps, staged combustion engines often require smaller boost pumps so to prevent both preburner [[backflow]] and turbopump [[cavitation]]. For example, the RD-180 and RS-25 use boost pumps driven by [[Tap-off cycle|tap-off]] and [[expander cycle]]s, as well as [[Pressure-fed engine|pressurized tanks]], to incrementally increase propellant pressure prior to entering the preburner.

===Full-flow staged combustion cycle===
[[Image:Full flow staged rocket cycle.png|thumb|right|260px|Full-flow staged combustion rocket cycle]]
'''Full-flow staged combustion''' (FFSC) is a twin-shaft staged combustion cycle that uses both oxidizer-rich and fuel-rich preburners. The cycle allows full flow of both propellants through the turbines; hence the name.&lt;ref name=sippel2012/&gt; The fuel [[turbopump]] is driven by the fuel-rich preburner, and the oxidizer turbopump is driven by the oxidizer-rich preburner.&lt;ref name=accrosslinkmag-vol05nbr01 /&gt;&lt;ref name=sippel2012&gt;
{{cite journal |last=Sippel|first=Martin |author2=Yamashiro, Ryoma |author3=Cremaschi, Francesco  |title=Staged Combustion Cycle Rocket Engine Design Trade-offs for Future Advanced Passenger Transport |url=http://elib.dlr.de/78208/1/Prop2012-2.pdf |journal=Space Propulsion 2012 |date=2012-05-10 |series=ST28-5 |accessdate=2014-03-19 |publisher=DLR-SART }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Benefits of the full-flow staged combustion cycle include turbines that run cooler and at lower pressure, due to increased mass flow, leading to a longer engine life and higher reliability. As an example, up to 25 flights were anticipated for an engine design studied by the [[German Aerospace Center|DLR (German Aerospace Center)]] in the frame of the [[SpaceLiner]] project.&lt;ref name=sippel2012/&gt; Further, the full-flow cycle eliminates the need for an interpropellant turbine seal normally required to separate oxidizer-rich gas from the fuel turbopump or fuel-rich gas from the oxidizer turbopump,&lt;ref name=nsf20140307&gt;
{{cite news |last=Belluscio|first=Alejandro G. |title=SpaceX advances drive for Mars rocket via Raptor power |url=http://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2014/03/spacex-advances-drive-mars-rocket-raptor-power/ |accessdate=2014-03-09 |newspaper=NASAspaceflight.com |date=2014-03-07 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus improving reliability.

Since the use of both fuel and oxidizer preburners results in full gasification of each propellant before entering the combustion chamber, FFSC engines belong to a broader class of rocket engines called gas-gas engines.&lt;ref name=nsf20140307/&gt; Full gasification of components leads to faster chemical reactions in the combustion chamber, which improves performance.

Potential disadvantages of the full-flow staged combustion cycle includes increased engineering complexity of two preburners, relative to a single-shaft staged combustion cycle, as well as an increased parts count.

Only three full-flow staged combustion rocket engines have ever progressed sufficiently to be tested on test stands; the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[NPO Energomash|Energomash]] [[RD-270]] project in the 1960s,  [[SpaceX]]'s [[Raptor (rocket engine)|Raptor]] engine first test-fired in September 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/780275236922994688 |title=Elon Musk on Twitter: "SpaceX propulsion just achieved first firing of the Raptor interplanetary transport engine" |publisher=[[Twitter]] |date=2009-06-02 |accessdate=2016-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  , and the [[Federal government of the United States|US government]]-funded [[Aerojet Rocketdyne]] [[Integrated powerhead demonstrator|Integrated powerhead]] demonstration project in the mid-2000s.&lt;ref name=nsf20140307/&gt;

The design of this engine would be a departure from the “open cycle” gas generator system that the current Merlin 1 engine series uses. Instead, the new rocket engine would use a much more efficient “staged combustion” cycle that many Russian rocket engines use.''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''standard Gibbs free energy of formation''' of a compound is the change of [[Gibbs free energy]] that accompanies the formation of 1 [[mole (unit)|mole]] of a substance in its [[standard state]] from its constituent elements in their standard states (the most stable form of the element at 1 bar of pressure and the specified temperature, usually 298.15 K or 25&amp;nbsp;°C).

The table below lists the Standard Gibbs function of formation for several elements and  chemical compounds and is taken from Lange's Handbook of Chemistry. Note that all values are in kJ/mol.  Far more extensive tables can be found in the [[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics]] and the NIST JANAF tables.&lt;ref&gt;M.W. Chase, NIST - JANAF Thermochemical Tables, 4th Edition, Journal of Physical and Chemical Reference Data, Monograph 9, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  The [[National Institute of Standards and Technology|NIST]] Chemistry WebBook (see link below) is an online resource that contains [[standard enthalpy of formation]] for various compounds along with the standard [[entropy|absolute entropy]] for these compounds from which the Standard Gibbs Free Energy of Formation can be calculated.

It tells the story of the now demolished [[South Central Farm]]; a community garden and [[urban farm]] located in [[Los Angeles]], [[California]]. ''The Garden'' details the plight of the South Central Farmers, a mostly Latinx community of farmers who organized and worked on the farm. After a suspected back room deal, the land upon which the farm operated was sold from the city back to the original owner, Richard Horowitz. He then decided he did not want to allow the farmers to use it anymore. Despite efforts to keep their farm, the South Central Farmers were evicted and their garden was bulldozed.  The film was nominated for an [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature]] on 22 January 2009.

''The Garden'' includes appearances by [[Danny Glover]], [[Daryl Hannah]], and [[Antonio Villaraigosa]].

==Awards==
''The Garden'' was nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Documentary Feature|Best Documentary Feature]] in the [[81st Academy Awards]].

The [[International Documentary Association]] nominated it for the [[Pare Lorentz Award]].

It won the Grand Jury Award from the 2008 [[Silverdocs Documentary Festival]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8802">'''Tropical cyclone seasonal forecasting''' is the process of predicting the number of [[tropical cyclone]]s in one of the world's seven [[tropical cyclone basin]]s during a particular tropical cyclone season. In the north Atlantic Ocean, one of the most widely publicized annual predictions comes from the [[Tropical Meteorology Project]] at [[Colorado State University]]. These reports are written by Philip J. Klotzbach and [[William M. Gray]].

==Colorado State University's Tropical Meteorology Project==
Since 1984, Dr [[William M. Gray]] and his associates at the [[Colorado State University]] has issued a seasonal forecast, that has aimed to predict the number of tropical storms and hurricanes that will develop within the Atlantic basin during the upcoming season amongst other factors. The forecasts were initially issued ahead of time for June and August.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xFpUAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=cI0DAAAAIBAJ&amp;dq=william%20gray&amp;pg=4468%2C354944|title=El Nino finally seems to be fading|newspaper=Boca Raton News|date=December 2, 1983|accessdate=11 April 2013|author=Toner, Mike|pages=Section 1C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the active 2005 Atlantic hurricane season, Dr Gray decided to allow Philip J. Klotzbach to take the primary responsibility for the project’s seasonal, monthly and landfall probability forecasts effective with the first forecast for the 2006 Atlantic hurricane season.&lt;ref name="colostate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hurricane.atmos.colostate.edu/Forecasts/2005/nov2005/|title=SUMMARY OF 2005 ATLANTIC TC ACTIVITY AND VERIFICATION OF SEASONAL AND MONTHLY FORECASTS|publisher=hurricane.atmos.colostate.edu|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- 
Over the These predictions have been issued at various times in

Since at least 1994, the Tropical Meteorology Project team at [[Colorado State University]] has issued pre-season predictions in December, April and June for the number of named storms ([[tropical storms]] and [[hurricanes]]), hurricanes and intense hurricanes (category 4 or 5) expected to appear in the [[Atlantic Hurricane | North Atlantic Tropical Cyclone Basin]].  These are one of many predictions issued for storms.
Boca Raton News --&gt;

==National Meteorological Services==
Ahead of each season several national meteorological services issue forecasts of how many tropical cyclones will form during a season and/or how many tropical cyclones will affect a particular country. Examples include the United Kingdom's [[Met Office]] which issues a {{cite web|url=http://www.metoffice.gov.uk/research/climate/seasonal-to-decadal/long-range/forecasts |title= seasonal forecast}} in May/June of the number of tropical storms for the upcoming Atlantic hurricane season, while the Philippine Atmospheric, Geophysical and Astronomical Service tries to predict how many tropical cyclones will move into its area of responsibility.

===United States National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration===
In August 1998, the United States [[Climate Prediction Center]] in conjunction with the [[National Hurricane Center]] and the [[Hurricane Research Division]] issued a tropical cyclone outlook, which accurately predicted that there would be an above-normal number of tropical storms and hurricanes in the Atlantic between August and October.&lt;ref name="noaa"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noaanews.noaa.gov/stories/s193.htm|title=NOAA News Online (Story 193)|publisher=noaanews.noaa.gov|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NOAA centres subsequently started to issue an outlook that gave a general guide to the expected overall activity within the Atlantic Ocean.

Ahead of the 2003 Pacific hurricane season, the NOAA forecasters decided to start issuing an experimental tropical cyclone outlook for the Eastern Pacific, which was designed not to be updated during the mid-season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=NOAA issues first experimental Eastern Pacific Hurricane Outlook|author=Climate Prediction Center|author2=National Hurricane Center|author3=Hurricane Research Division|date=June 12, 2003|url=http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2003/jun03/noaa03069.html|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=10 August 2006|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140812104520/http://www.publicaffairs.noaa.gov/releases2003/jun03/noaa03069.html|archivedate=12 August 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a result of both the 2003 and 2004 outlooks being successful, the predictions became an operational product during 2005.&lt;ref name="noaa2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nws.noaa.gov/pa/fstories/2005/0505/fs16may2005a.php|title=NOAA RELEASES EAST PACIFIC HURRICANE SEASON OUTLOOK Below Normal Seasonal Activity Expected in 2005  – Public Affairs – NOAA – NWS|publisher=nws.noaa.gov|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

NOAA is also one of the contributors to New Zealand's [[National Institute of Water &amp; Atmospheric Research]] Tropical Cyclone Outlook, through its [[National Weather Service]] forecast offices in the region and the [[Climate Prediction Center]].&lt;ref name="niwa"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.niwa.co.nz/sites/default/files/icu151_amj_2013.pdf|date=4 April 2013|title=The Island Climate Update|accessdate=8 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia and the Pacific Islands===
New Zealand's [[National Institute of Water &amp; Atmospheric Research]] (NIWA) and collaborating agencies including the [[Meteorological Service of New Zealand]] and Pacific Island National Meteorological Services issue the "Island Climate Update Tropical Cyclone Outlook" for the Pacific. This forecast attempts to predict how many tropical cyclones and severe tropical cyclones will develop within the Southern Pacific between 135°E and 120°W as well as how many will affect a particular island nation. The [[Fiji Meteorological Service]] while collaborating with NIWA and partners also publishes its own seasonal forecast but for the South Pacific basin between 160°E and 120°W. Since the start of the 2009–10 season, the Australian [[Bureau of Meteorology]]'s National Climate Center has publicly released a forecast for the Australian region which focused on the broadscale aspects of the cyclone season, and forecasted how likely it was that a subregion was to see activity above the average as well as how many tropical cyclones may occur within the basin and each of its subregions.&lt;ref name="Seasonal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/ahead/tc.html |title=Seasonal Outlook for Tropical Cyclones |date=19 October 2009 |publisher=Bureau of Meteorology |accessdate=26 December 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5mJ8JEHCC?url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/ahead/tc.html |archivedate=26 December 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/outlooks/index.shtml |title=Tropical Cyclone Outlooks |author=Staff Writer |year=2009 |publisher=Bureau of Meteorology |accessdate=6 October 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5tGdptCTv?url=http://www.bom.gov.au/cyclone/outlooks/index.shtml |archivedate=6 October 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However ahead of the 2011–12 season the NCC stopped forecasting publicly how many tropical cyclones may occur in a certain region and just forecasted how likely it was that a subregion was to see activity above the average.&lt;ref name="11-12 BoM"&gt;{{cite web |title=2011–2012 Australian Tropical Cyclone Season Outlook |publisher=[[Australian Bureau of Meteorology]] |url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/ahead/tc.2011-12.shtml |accessdate=8 January 2013 |author=National Climate Centre |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6DVaFWOgr?url=http://www.bom.gov.au/climate/ahead/tc.2011-12.shtml |archivedate=8 January 2013 |date=15 October 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
