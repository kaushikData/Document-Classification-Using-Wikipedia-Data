==European Union==
On 27 April 2009, the [[European Union]] health commissioner advised Europeans to avoid traveling to the United States or Mexico when possible. The same day, the first confirmed case of swine flu in the EU was announced in Spain.&lt;ref name="Guardian 27/4"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/27/swine-flu-mexico|title=Europeans urged to avoid Mexico and US as swine flu death toll exceeds 100|date=27 April 2009|publisher=Guardian|accessdate=27 April 2009 | location=London | first=Daniel | last=Nasaw| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090430094402/http://www.guardian.co.uk/world/2009/apr/27/swine-flu-mexico| archivedate= 30 April 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The EU Commissioner for External Relations at the time, [[Benita Ferrero-Waldner]], said on 27 April all travel to Mexico and the disinfecting of all airports in response to the global flu outbreak were being considered.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/latestCrisis/idUSLT886731 EU considers halting all Mexico travel- commissioner]{{Dead link|date=November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Albania==

On 20 July 2009, authorities in [[Albania]] reported the country's first positive case of swine flu. The infected person was a student from [[Gjirokastra]], who tested positive to the virus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setimes.com/cocoon/setimes/xhtml/en_GB/newsbriefs/setimes/newsbriefs/2009/07/21/nb-09 |title=Albania reports first swine flu case |publisher=SETimes.com |date= |accessdate=21 July 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The student was later reported to have fully recovered from the flu. A few days later, three other cases were confirmed. The infected people, two sailors from the [[Philippines]] and one from [[Romania]], were admitted to a [[Durrës]] city hospital. By 24 July, there were four cases of swine flu confirmed in Albania.  On 3 December 2009, the first death from swine flu was confirmed in Albania.

The National Institute for Health and Welfare (THL) said that the H1N1 outbreaks in northern Finland were reaching epidemic proportions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.yle.fi/uutiset/news/2009/10/finland_sees_first_signs_of_swine_flu_epidemic_1086910.html YLE.fi]&lt;/ref&gt; THL also reported that by 16 October there were 377 confirmed cases in Finland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ktl.fi/portal/suomi/terveyden_ammattilaisille/tartuntataudit_ja_epidemiat/influenssa_a_h1n1v_raportoidut_tapaukset |title=KTL.fi |publisher=Ktl.fi |date= |accessdate=27 August 2010 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100820001335/http://www.ktl.fi/portal/suomi/terveyden_ammattilaisille/tartuntataudit_ja_epidemiat/influenssa_a_h1n1v_raportoidut_tapaukset |archivedate=20 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iceland is currently being briefed by the [[WHO]] and is cooperating closely with [[ECDC]], [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention|CDC]] and the EU in terms of monitoring and response. Initially the directorate of health warned people traveling to Mexico and the United States (especially California and Texas) to exercise caution and to contact a doctor immediately if they started showing symptoms of swine flu but on 28 April people traveling to Mexico were advised to cancel their trip unless it's very urgent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=мsland |url=http://www.ruv.is/heim/frettir/frett/store64/item262503/ |title=RзV&amp;nbsp;– TvЖ hugsanleg svМnaflensutilfelli |language=is |publisher=Ruv.is |date= |accessdate=30 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090503091458/http://www.ruv.is/heim/frettir/frett/store64/item262503/| archivedate= 3 May 2009| deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.landlaeknir.is/Pages/1055?NewsID=1897 |title=Landlæknisembættið&amp;nbsp;– Fréttir |publisher=Landlaeknir.is |date= |accessdate=27 April 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429231431/http://www.landlaeknir.is/Pages/1055?NewsID=1897 |archivedate=29 April 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 April, it was announced that passengers arriving in Iceland from the United States or Mexico would be monitored and will undergo [[medical examination]] even if the slightest signs of influenza are detected.&lt;ref name="farthegum1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mbl.is/mm/frettir/innlent/2009/04/28/fylgst_med_farthegum/ |title=Fylgst með farþegum |publisher=mbl.is |date= |accessdate=28 April 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090429230916/http://www.mbl.is/mm/frettir/innlent/2009/04/28/fylgst_med_farthegum/| archivedate= 29 April 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iceland has stocks of [[Tamiflu]] and [[Relenza]] for one-third of its population.&lt;ref name="farthegum1"/&gt;

In a risk assessment made by the Icelandic government in 2008 in case of an influenza [[pandemic]] two scenarios are envisioned:
* A worst-case scenario where 50% of the Icelandic population are infected and 3% of the infected population die.
* A milder scenario where precautionary measures prevent infection, 25% of the Icelandic population are infected and 1% die.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.influensa.is/lisalib/getfile.aspx?itemid=3515 |title= ?|publisher= ? |year=2008 |accessdate=1 May 2009| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090429174730/http://www.influensa.is/lisalib/getfile.aspx?itemid=3515| archivedate= 29 April 2009| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A free swine flu vaccination is to be offered to the general population in the coming months, as part of a major plan to avoid the worst affects of a global pandemic.

The HSE plans to acquire over 7,500,000 doses of the vaccine, at a cost of almost €90 million.

The jabs would be administered by GPs or through a network of over a hundred swine flu clinics and will be ready by the autumn.

12 new cases of swine flu were confirmed here yesterday, bringing the total number in Ireland to 63.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Red hot |url=http://www.herald.ie/breaking-news/national-news/government-to-provide-free-swine-flu-jab-1806257.html |archive-url=https://archive.is/20120802182829/http://www.herald.ie/breaking-news/national-news/government-to-provide-free-swine-flu-jab-1806257.html |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2 August 2012 |title=Herald.ie |publisher=Herald.ie |date=4 July 2009 |accessdate=27 August 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tuesday 21 July

11 new cases of the H1N1 virus have been identified in Ireland bringing the total number of confirmed cases to 164 including 17 cases which are believed to have been in-country transmissions of the virus.

As of 28 July 2009, there are reportedly 276 confirmed cases in Ireland, according to the [[Health Service Executive|HSE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0728/swineflu.html |title=RTE.ie |publisher=RTE.ie |date=28 July 2009 |accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A man in his 30s is critically ill in St James's Hospital in Dublin with human swine flu (H1N1). The man, who is originally from Bratislava in Slovakia, was admitted to hospital late last week. He has been working in Ireland for several years.

Around 1,500 people visited GPs last week with suspected swine flu, three times more than the most recent figures released.

Director of the Health Protection Surveillance Centre Dr Darina O'Flanagan said the figure was included in the latest data from the Irish College of General Practitioners.

It represents 37 people per 100,000 and is three times more than figures released yesterday by the Department of Health.

The Department said laboratory tests have confirmed 278 cases of the H1N1 virus have been reported but the actual number exceeds that total as family doctors report an increase in the number of cases they have been diagnosing in recent weeks.

Two patients who contracted human swine flu (H1N1) are still being treated in intensive care units.

Chief medical officer at the Department of Health Dr Tony Holohan said yesterday that the HSE expects some deaths from the virus, and further hospitalisations, over the coming weeks and months.

Dr Holohan said 12 people have been hospitalised so far.

A man in his 30s, who was admitted to St James's Hospital last week, remains 'critically ill' with the virus.

It is believed the man, who is originally from Bratislava in Slovakia, contracted the virus abroad. He has been living in Ireland for several years.

The hospital said that all necessary precautions were being taken and that the Health Service Executive and the Department of Health were being fully informed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2009/0729/swineflu.html |title=RTE.ie |publisher=RTE.ie |date=29 July 2009 |accessdate=27 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''assisted living residence''' or '''assisted living facility''' ('''ALF''') is a housing facility for people with [[Disability|disabilities]] or for adults who cannot or choose not to live [[independent living|independently]]. The term is 
popular in the United States but is similar to a [[retirement home]] in the sense that facilities provide a group living environment and typically cater to an elderly population. There is also Caribbean assisted living, which offers a similar service, in a resort-like environment (like assisted vacationing).

Assisted living exemplifies the shift from "care as service" to "care as business" in the broader health care arena predicted more than three decades ago.&lt;ref&gt;Starr, P. 1982. The Social Transformation of American Medicine. New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt; A consumer-driven industry, assisted living offers a wide range of options, levels of care, and diversity of services (Lockhart, 2009) and is subject to state rather than federal regulatory oversight. Exactly what "assisted living" means depends on both the state and provider in question: variations in state regulatory definitions are significant and provider variables include everything from philosophy, geographic location and auspice, to organizational size and structure. Assisted living evolved from small "board and care" or "personal care" homes and offers a "social model" of care (compared to the medical model of a skilled nursing facility).  The assisted living industry is a segment of the senior housing industry and assisted living services can be delivered in stand-alone facilities or as part of multi-level senior living community.  The industry is fragmented and dominated by for-profit providers. In 2010, only six of the seventy largest providers were non-profit and none of the top twenty was non-profit (Martin, 2010).  Information in this edit is from an article published in 2012 that reviewed the industry and reports results of a research study of assisted living facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Cirka, C.C., &amp; Messikomer, C.M. 2012. Behind the facade: Aligning artifacts, values and assumptions in assisted living. Business &amp; Professional Ethics Journal, 31 (1), 79 - 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 the U.S. Government estimated that there were 22,200 assisted living facilities in the U.S. (compared to 15,700 nursing homes) and that 713,300 people were residents of these facilities.&lt;ref&gt;CDC, Long Term Care Services, 2013, https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nsltcp/long_term_care_services_2013.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The number of assisted living facilities in the U.S. has increased dramatically since the early 2000s.

In the U.S., ALFs can be owned by for-profit companies (publicly traded companies or limited liability companies [LLCs]), non-profit organizations, or governments.&lt;ref name="CDC LTC 2013"&gt;{{cite web |title=Long Term Care Services|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/data/nsltcp/long_term_care_services_2013.pdf |publisher=CDC|date=2013|accessdate=August 19, 2018 |page=61}}&lt;/ref&gt; These facilities typically provide supervision or assistance with [[activities of daily living]] (ADLs); coordination of services by outside health care providers; and monitoring of resident activities to help to ensure their health, safety, and well-being. Assistance often includes the administration or supervision of medication, or personal care services.

There has been controversy generated by reports of neglect, abuse and mistreatment of residents at assisted living facilities in the U.S.

==Canada==
In Canada, there are also some differences in how assisted living is understood from one province to the next. In most provinces, the phrase is understood as less independent than it is in the United States. People often require help with more than one of the [[activities of daily living]] or the more intensive ADLs like feeding or bathing. In the province of [[Alberta]], "supportive living" is the distinct phrasing used for a type of care that is otherwise synonymous. The province's ''Supportive Living Accommodation Licensing Act'' is a comprehensive act with specific prescriptions governing care homes licensing, inspections and more.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Marie and Bill moved into assisted living |url=http://www.comfortlife.ca/retirement-communities/assisted-living |title=Assisted Living Retirement Communities in Canada |publisher=ComfortLife.ca |date= |accessdate=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
Within the United States assisted living spectrum, there is no nationally recognized definition of assisted living.{{citation needed|date=July 2016}} Assisted living facilities are regulated and licensed at the US state level. More than two-thirds of the states use the [[licensure]] term "assisted living."  Other licensure terms used for this philosophy of care include residential care home, assisted care living facilities, and personal care homes. Each state licensing agency has its own definition of the term it uses to describe assisted living. Because the term assisted living has not been defined in some states it is often a marketing term used by a variety of senior living communities, licensed or unlicensed. Assisted Living facilities in the United States had a national median monthly rate of $3,500.00 in 2014, a 1.45% increase over 2013 and a 4.29% increase over a five-year period from 2009-2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Genworth 2014 Cost of Care Survey|url=https://www.genworth.com/dam/Americas/US/PDFs/Consumer/corporate/131168-032514-Executive-Summary-nonsecure.pdf|publisher=Genworth|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assisted Living|url=https://www.senioradvisor.com/ind/assisted-living|publisher=SA|accessdate=5 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Types===
{{unreferenced section|date=July 2016}}
As widely varied as the state licensing and definitions are, so are the types of physical layouts of buildings in which assisted living services are provided.  Assisted living facilities can range in size from a small residential house for one resident up to very large facilities providing services to hundreds of residents. Assisted living falls somewhere between an independent living community and a skilled nursing facility in terms of the level of care provided. [[Continuing care]] retirement facilities combine independent living, assisted living, and nursing care in one facility.

People who live in newer assisted living facilities usually have their own private apartment. There is usually no special medical monitoring equipment that one would find in a nursing home, and their nursing staff may not be available at all hours. However, trained staff are usually on-site around the clock to provide other needed services. Household chores are performed: sheets are changed, laundry is done, and food is cooked and served as part of the base rent and included services.  Depending on their disclosure of services, assisted living services may include medication management, bathing assistance, dressing, escorts to meals and activities, toileting, transferring, and insulin injections by an RN. Some homes even have a beauty parlor on site. Grocery service is often available too.  Where provided, private apartments generally are self-contained; i.e., they have their own bedroom and bathroom, and may have a separate living area or small kitchen. Registered nurses and licensed practical nurses are available by phone or e-mail 24 hours a day, to ensure proper teaching and/or education of staff is available.

Alternatively, individual living spaces may resemble a dormitory or hotel room consisting of a private or semi-private sleeping area and a shared bathroom.  There are usually common areas for socializing, as well as a central kitchen and dining room for preparing and eating meals.

===Typical resident===
{{one source|section|date=July 2016}}
An assisted living resident is defined as a resident who needs assistance with at least one of the [[activities of daily living]].

A typical assisted living facility resident would usually be a [[senior citizen]] who does not need the level of care offered by a nursing home but prefers more companionship and needs some assistance in day-to-day living. Age groups will vary with every facility. There is currently a transformation occurring in long-term care. Assisted living communities are accepting higher and higher levels of care and nursing homes are becoming a place for those who are undergoing rehabilitation after a hospital stay or who need extensive assistance. Many assisted living communities now accept individuals who need assistance with all activities of daily living.

The "Overview of Assisted Living Report" from 2010 stated that 54 percent of assisted living residents are 85 years or older; 27 percent are 75–84 years old; 9 percent of residents are between 65 and 74 years; and 11 percent are younger than 65 years old.  74% of assisted living residents are female; 26 percent are male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ahcancal.org/ncal/resources/Pages/ResidentProfile.aspx |title=Resident Profile |publisher=Ahcancal.org |date= |accessdate=2016-09-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160615104233/https://www.ahcancal.org/ncal/resources/Pages/ResidentProfile.aspx |archive-date=2016-06-15 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Special needs===
{{one source|section|date=July 2016}}
The residence may assist in arranging the appropriate medical, health, and dental care services for each resident. The resident generally chooses his or her medical doctor and dental services.

Residents who have periods of temporary incapacity due to illness, injury, or recuperation from surgery often choose assisted living as a supportive option to help them recover quickly so then can return home. In the case of these short-term respite stays, assisted living residences act as the bridge between hospital and home.

Short-term respite stays in assisted living are also an option for families when the primary caregiver goes out of town or is otherwise unable to provide the needed care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.seniorly.com/resources/articles/respite-for-caregivers |title=Respite Care for Family Caregivers |publisher=Seniorly.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

More recently built facilities are designed with an emphasis on ease of use for disabled people. Bathrooms and kitchens are designed with [[wheelchair]]s and [[walker (tool)|walker]]s in mind. Hallways and doors are extra-wide to accommodate wheelchairs. These facilities are by necessity fully compliant with the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] (ADA) or similar legislation elsewhere.

The socialization aspects of ALFs are very beneficial to the occupants. Normally the facility has many activities scheduled for the occupants, keeping in mind different disabilities and needs.

===Locked units===
{{one source|section|date=July 2016}}
Many ALFs also serve the needs of people with some form of [[dementia]] including [[Alzheimer's disease]] and others with [[mental disabilities]], as long as they do not present an imminent danger to themselves or others.  These sections are often referred to as memory care.  In the United States, legislation enacted by each state defines not only the level of care, but often what conditions are prohibited from being cared for in such a home.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Memory Care In Assisted Living Communities|url=http://www.assistedlivingcenter.com/articles/memory-care-in-assisted-living-communities/#states-legal|website=Assisted Living Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In California, these units are not "locked" they are secured by alarms, delays, keypads needing a code, etc.  However, they are not locked units like a psychiatric ward.

Many ALFs will work to accommodate a person who suffers from severe forms of Alzheimer's by having separate private units. These units are part of the main building but are secured so residents with Alzheimer's cannot leave and possibly do harm to themselves. The units usually house fewer people and more attention from the caregivers is provided.

The units, usually called locked units, focus on applying [[cognitive]] and mental activities to try to help keep the mind fresh. Since there is no cure for the disease, the goal is to work at prolonging or delaying the disease. If one is not engaged in activity, his or her memory will deteriorate more rapidly.

===Controversy===
====2011 ''Miami Herald'' investigation====
A 2011 investigation by the ''Miami Herald'' into assisted living facilities in Florida won the [[Pulitzer Prize]],{{citation needed|date=August 2018}} and found that:
# "the safeguards once hailed as the most progressive in the nation have been ignored in a string of tragedies never before revealed to the public,"
# "that the Agency for Health Care Administration, which oversees the state’s 2,850 assisted-living facilities, has failed to monitor shoddy operators, investigate dangerous practices or shut down the worst offenders," and
# "as the ranks of assisted-living facilities grew to make room for Florida’s booming elderly population, the state failed to protect the people it was meant to serve."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author1=Rob Barry |author2=Michael Sallah |author3=Carol Marbin Miller |title=NEGLECTED TO DEATH  {{!}} Part 1: Once pride of Florida; now scenes of neglect |url=https://www.miamiherald.com/news/special-reports/neglected-to-death/article1938076.html |accessdate=August 19, 2018 |work=Miami Herald |date=April 30, 2011 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The investigation found dozens of incidents of gross mismanagement and criminal behavior at assisted living facilities across Florida, a state of 20 million people which is popular with American retirees. The newspaper requested the release of state documents related to the deaths of over 300 people in assisted living facilities between 2003 and 2011 but were denied these documents. Still, the newspaper's investigation found no less than 70 people who had died due to the "actions of their caregivers."&lt;ref&gt;Miami Herald, April 30, 2011 5:00 AM, NEGLECTED TO DEATH | Part 2: Assisted-living facility caretakers unpunished: ‘There’s a lack of justice’, http://www.miamiherald.com/news/special-reports/neglected-to-death/article1938087.html&lt;/ref&gt; The deaths were found to have resulted from the mismanagement of assisted living facilities and by the practices of their staff and managers who drugged residents, deprived them of basic necessities such as food and water, abused residents verbally, psychologically and physically, and neglecting their needs.

====2013 ''Frontline'' investigation====
On July 30, 2013 ''[[Frontline (U.S. TV series)|Frontline]]'' ran an hour long program&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Frontline, ProPublica Investigate Assisted Living in America|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/pages/frontline/pressroom/frontline-propublica-investigate-assisted-living-in-america/|accessdate=10 August 2013|agency=Frontline, WGBH Educational Foundation (PBS)|publisher=KQED (PBS)|date=17 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; with help from [[ProPublica]]&lt;ref name="ProPublica"&gt;{{cite news|author1=A.C. Thompson |author2=Jonathan Jones|title=Life and Death in Assisted Living, Part 1  "The Emerald City"|url=https://www.propublica.org/series/life-and-death-in-assisted-living|accessdate=10 August 2013|agency=Pro Publica Inc.|publisher=(ProPublica in collaboration with WBGH/PBS, Frontline)|date=29 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; detailing some tragedies that happened in assisted living.

At the time the documentary was broadcast and published, ''Frontline'' stated that, "Today, nearly 750,000 people live in assisted living facilities across the country. National for-profit chains, concerned both about caring for their residents and pleasing their shareholders, have come to dominate the industry. Standards for care and training—and even definitions for the term 'assisted living'—vary from state to state. Assisted living facilities, unlike nursing homes, are not regulated by the federal government."{{cite quote|date=August 2018}} An accompanying written brief cites deaths of residents, facilities that are understaffed, employees that are inadequately trained, and that an overall "push to fill facilities and maximize revenues has left staff overwhelmed and the care of residents endangered."

A related article by ''ProPublica'' (Thomson and Jones, July 29, 2013) states that a facility operated by [[Emeritus Senior Living]] "...had been found wanting in almost every important regard. And, in truth, those 'specially trained' staffers hadn’t actually been trained to care for people with Alzheimer’s and other forms of dementia, a violation of California law."  It goes on to say, "The facility relied on a single nurse to track the health of its scores of residents, and the few licensed medical professionals who worked there tended not to last long," but also that "During some stretches, the facility went months without a full-time nurse on the payroll."  ''ProPublica's'' article claimed the problem was not specific to one facility and that "State inspectors for years had cited Emeritus facilities across California."  Emeritus replied to that claim, describing "any shortcomings as isolated," as well as that "any problems that arise are promptly addressed."  The company cited their "growing popularity as evidence of consumer satisfaction."

===Comparison between assisted living and personal care===
In Pennsylvania, personal care and assisted living are terms that are defined separately.

Personal care and assisted living in PA are regulated by the Pennsylvania Bureau of Human Services Licensing (a division of the Department of Human Services).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Human Services Licensing|url=http://www.dhs.pa.gov/provider/longtermcareservices/index.htm|website=Pennsylvania Department of Human Services}}&lt;/ref&gt; Up until January 2011, the terms “assisted living” and “personal care” were considered interchangeable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assisted Living and Personal Care in PA: There is a Difference|url=http://www.transforminghealth.org/stories/2015/05/assisted-living-and-personal-care-in-pa-there-is-a-difference.php|website=Transforming Health}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that time, Pennsylvania began licensing assisted living facilities separately from personal care facilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Gallardo|first1=Matthew|title=Evaluating AL versus personal care homes in PA|url=http://www.mcknights.com/guest-columns/evaluating-al-versus-personal-care-homes-in-pa/article/389714/|website=McKnight's}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Chapter 2800 of the 55 Pennsylvania Code defines assisted living as “a significant long-term care alternative to allow individuals to age in place,” where residents “will receive the assistance they need to age in place and develop and maintain maximum independence, exercise decision-making and personal choice.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regulatory Compliance Guide: 55 Pa. Code Chapter 2800|url=http://www.dhs.pa.gov/cs/groups/webcontent/documents/communication/p_023324.pdf|website=Pennsylvania Department of Human Services}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Likewise, Chapter 2600 of the 55 Pa. Code defines personal care as “A premise in which food, shelter and personal assistance or supervision are provided for a period exceeding 24 hours, for four or more adults who are not relatives of the operator, who do not require the services in or of a licensed long-term care facility, but who do require assistance or supervision in activities of daily living or instrumental activities of daily living.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=55 Pa. Code Chapter 2600.4 Definitions|url=http://www.pacode.com/secure/data/055/chapter2600/s2600.4.html|website=The Pennsylvania Code}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The differences between the two levels of care is broken down into three categories:

'''Concept –''' Assisted living residences permit residents to age in place, meaning that even as their health care needs increase, they will not have to relocate to another senior living home to receive that care, such as skilled nursing.

'''Construction –''' Assisted living residences must provide residents a private room with a lockable door, a private bathroom and small kitchen. Personal care homes are not required to offer these amenities.

'''Level of Care –''' Assisted living residences must ensure that residents receive skilled nursing care if their needs surpass standard assisted living services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Assisted living or personal care?

'''Community mental health services''' ('''CMHS'''), also known as '''community mental health teams''' ('''CMHT''') in the [[United Kingdom]], support or treat people with [[mental disorder]]s ([[mental illness]] or [[mental health]] difficulties) in a domiciliary setting, instead of a [[psychiatric hospital]] (asylum). The array of community mental health services vary depending on the country in which the services are provided. It refers to a system of care in which the patient's community, not a specific facility such as a hospital, is the primary provider of care for people with a mental illness.  The goal of community mental health services often includes much more than simply providing outpatient psychiatric treatment.&lt;ref name=Bentley&gt;{{cite journal |last=Bentley |first=K.J. |date=November 1994 |title=Supports for community-based mental health care: an optimistic view of federal legislation |journal=Health &amp; Social Work |volume=19 |issue=4 |pages=288–294 |pmid=7813967 |doi=10.1093/hsw/19.4.288 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Community services include [[supported housing]] with full or partial supervision (including [[halfway house]]s), psychiatric wards of general [[hospitals]] (including [[partial hospitalization]]), local [[primary care]] medical services, day centers or [[Clubhouse Model of Psychosocial Rehabilitation|clubhouses]], community mental health centers, and [[self-help groups for mental health]].

The services may be provided by government organizations and [[mental health professionals]], including specialized teams providing services across a geographical area, such as [[assertive community treatment]] and [[early psychosis]] teams. They may also be provided by private or charitable organizations. They may be based on [[peer support]] and the [[Psychiatric survivors movement|consumer/survivor/ex-patient movement]].

The [[World Health Organization]] states that community mental health services are more [[accessible]] and effective, lessen [[social exclusion]], and are likely to have less possibilities for the neglect and violations of [[human rights]] that were often encountered in mental hospitals. However, WHO notes that in many countries, the closing of mental hospitals has not been accompanied by the development of community services, leaving a service [[vacuum]] with far too many not receiving any care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |publisher=World Health Organization press release |date=1 June 2007 |url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/news/notes/2007/np25/en/index.html |title=Community mental health services will lessen social exclusion, says WHO |location=Geneva }}&lt;/ref&gt;

New legal powers have developed in some countries, such as the [[United States]], to supervise and ensure compliance with treatment of individuals living in the community, known as [[outpatient commitment]] or assisted outpatient treatment or community treatment orders.

==History==

===Origins===
Community mental health services began as an effort to contain those who were "mad" or considered "lunatics".&lt;ref name=Porter&gt;{{cite book |last=Porter |first=Roy |date=2004 |title=Madmen: A Social History of Madhouses, Mad-Doctors &amp; Lunatics |location=Stroud, Gloucestershire |publisher=Tempus Publishing |oclc=58554197 |isbn=978-0-7524-1972-5 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Understanding the [[History of mental disorders]] is crucial in understanding the development of community mental health services.  As medical psychology developed as a science and shifted toward the treatment of the mentally ill, [[History of psychiatric institutions|psychiatric institutions]] began to develop around the world, and laid the groundwork for modern day community mental health services.

===Pre-deinstitutionalization===
On July 3, 1946 President [[Harry S. Truman|Harry Truman]] signed the [[National Mental Health Act]] which, for the first time in the history of the United States, generated a large amount of federal funding for both psychiatric education and research.  The passing of this Act eventually led to the founding of the [[National Institute of Mental Health]] (NIMH) in 1949.&lt;ref name=MPS&gt;{{cite web|website=Minnesota Psychiatric Society |title=A Detailed History of Mental Health |date=20 February 2004 |url=http://www.mnpsychsoc.org/history%20appendix.pdf |archive-date=2012-09-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120915234159/http://www.mnpsychsoc.org/history%20appendix.pdf |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the 1940s and moving into the beginning of the 1950s, the governor of Minnesota [[Luther Youngdahl]] initiated the development of numerous community-based mental health services. He also advocated for the humane treatment of people in state institutions.&lt;ref name = MPS /&gt;

===Deinstitutionalization===
[[Philippe Pinel]] played a large role in the ethical and humane treatment of patients and greatly influenced [[Dorothea Dix]]. Dix advocated the expansion of state psychiatric hospitals for patients who were at the time being housed in jails and poor houses.&lt;ref name=Kemp /&gt;{{page needed |date=October 2016}} Despite her good intentions, rapid [[urbanization]] and increased immigration led to a gross overwhelming of the state's mental health systems&lt;ref name=Kemp /&gt;{{page needed |date=October 2016}} and because of this, as the 19th century ended and the  20th century began, a shift in focus from treatment to custodial care was seen.&lt;ref name=Kemp /&gt;{{page needed |date=October 2016}}  As quality of care declined and psychotropic drugs were introduced, those with mental illnesses were reintroduced to the community, where community mental health services were designated as primary care providers.&lt;ref name=Kemp /&gt;{{page needed |date=October 2016}}

===Post-deinstitutionalization===
Following [[Deinstitutionalisation|deinstitutionalization]], many of the mentally ill ended up in jails, nursing homes, and on the streets as homeless individuals.&lt;ref name = Kemp&gt;{{cite book |last=Kemp |first=Donna R. |date=2007 |title=Mental Health in America |series=Contemporary world issues |location=Santa Barbara, CA |publisher=ABC-CLIO |oclc=636893648 |isbn=978-1-85109-789-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{page needed |date=October 2016}} It was at this point in history that modern community mental health services started to grow and become influential.
In 1955, following a major period of deinstitutionalization, the Mental Health Study Act was passed. With the passing of this Act, the U.S. Congress called for "an objective, thorough, nationwide analysis and reevaluation of the human and economic problems of mental health."&lt;ref name = MPS /&gt; Following Congress' mandate, the [[Joint Commission on Mental Illness]] conducted numerous studies.  For the next four years this Commission made recommendations to establish community mental health centers across the country.&lt;ref name=Kemp /&gt;{{page needed |date=October 2016}}  In 1963 the [[Community Mental Health Act|Community Mental Health Centers Act]] was passed, essentially kick-starting the community mental health revolution. This Act contributed further to deinstitutionalization by moving mental patients into their "least restrictive" environments.&lt;ref name = Accordino&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Accordino |first1=Michael P. |last2=Porter |first2=Dion F. |last3=Morse |first3=Torrey |date=April 2001 |title=Deinstitutionalization of Persons with Severe Mental Illness: Context and Consequences |journal=Journal of Rehabilitation |volume=67 |issue=2 |pages=16–21 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Community Mental Health Centers Act funded three main initiatives: 
# Professional training for those working in community mental health centers
# Improvement of research in the methodology utilized by community mental health centers
# Improving the quality of care of existing programs until newer community mental health centers could be developed.&lt;ref name = Accordino /&gt;
That same year the Mental Retardation Facilities and Community Mental Health Centers Construction Act was passed.  President [[John F. Kennedy]] ran part of his campaign on a platform strongly supporting community mental health in the United States. Kennedy's ultimate goal was to reduce custodial care of mental health patients by 50% in ten to twenty years.&lt;ref name=Kemp /&gt;{{page needed |date=October 2016}}  In 1965, the Community Mental Health Act was amended to ensure a long list of provisions.  First, construction and staffing grants were extended to include centers that served patients with substance abuse disorders.  Secondly, grants were provided to bolster the initiation and progression of community mental health services in low-SES areas.  Lastly, new grants were established to support mental health services aimed at helping children.&lt;ref name = MPS /&gt;
As the 20th century progressed, even more political influence was exerted on community mental health.  In 1965, with the passing of [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] and [[Medicaid]], there was an intense growth of skilled nursing homes and intermediate-care facilities that alleviated the burden felt by the large-scale public psychiatric hospitals.&lt;ref name=Kemp /&gt;{{page needed |date=October 2016}}

===20th century===
From 1965 to 1969, $260 million was authorized for community mental health centers.&lt;ref name=Kemp /&gt;{{page needed |date=October 2016}} Compared to other government organizations and programs, this number is strikingly low. The funding drops even further under [[Richard Nixon]] from 1970–1973 with a total of $50.3 million authorized.&lt;ref name=Kemp /&gt;{{page needed |date=October 2016}} Even though the funding for community mental health centers was on a steady decline, deinstitutionalization continued into the 1960s and 1970s.  The number of state and county mental hospital resident patients in 1950 was 512,501 and by 1989 had decreased to 101,402.  This continuing process of deinstitutionalization without adequate alternative resources led the mentally ill into homelessness, jails, and self-medication through the use of drugs or alcohol.&lt;ref name=Kemp /&gt;{{page needed |date=October 2016}}  In 1975 Congress passed an Act requiring community mental health centers to provide aftercare services to all patients in the hopes of improving recovery rates.  In 1980, just five years later, Congress passed the [[Mental Health Systems Act of 1980]], which provided federal funding for ongoing support and development of community mental health programs.&lt;ref name = Kemp /&gt;{{page needed |date=October 2016}} This Act strengthened the connection between federal, state, and local governments with regards to funding for community mental health services.  It was the final result of a long series of recommendations by [[Jimmy Carter]]'s Mental Health Commission.&lt;ref name = MPS /&gt; 
Despite this apparent progress, just a year after the Mental Health Systems Act was passed, the [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1981]] was passed. The Omnibus Act was passed by the efforts of the [[Reagan administration]] as an effort to reduce domestic spending.  The Act rescinded a large amount of the legislation just passed, and the legislation that was not rescinded was almost entirely revamped. It effectively ended federal funding of community treatment for the mentally ill, shifting the burden entirely to individual state governments.&lt;ref name = Accordino /&gt; Federal funding was now replaced by granting smaller amounts of money to the individual states.&lt;ref name=Mosher&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mosher |first1=Loren R. |last2=Burti |first2=Lorenzo |date=1989 |title=Community Mental Health: Principles and Practice |location=New York |publisher=Norton |oclc=18167227 |isbn=978-0-393-70060-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed |date=October 2016}}  
In 1977, the National Institute of Mental Health (NIMH) initiated its [[Community Support Program]] (C.S.P.).  The C.S.P.'s goal was to shift the focus from psychiatric institutions and the services they offer to networks of support for individual clients.&lt;ref name=Mosher /&gt;{{Page needed |date=October 2016}} The C.S.P. established the ten elements of a community support system listed below:
# Responsible team
# Residential care
# Emergency care
# Medicare care
# Halfway house
# Supervised (supported) apartments
# Outpatient therapy
# Vocational training and opportunities
# Social and recreational opportunities
# Family and network attention&lt;ref&gt;Turner &amp; Tenhoor, 1978&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=October 2016}}

This conceptualization of what makes a good community program has come to serve as a theoretical guideline for community mental health service development throughout the modern-day United States psychological community.&lt;ref name=Mosher /&gt;{{Page needed |date=October 2016}}  
In 1986 Congress passed the [[Mental Health Planning Act of 1986]], which was a Federal law requiring that at the state government level, all states must have plans for establishing case management under Medicaid, improving mental health coverage of community mental health services, adding rehabilitative services, and expanding clinical services to the homeless population.&lt;ref name = MPS /&gt; More specifically, community mental health providers could now receive reimbursement for services from Medicare and Medicaid, which allowed for many of the centers to expand their range of treatment options and services.&lt;ref name = Accordino /&gt;
As the 1990s began, many positive changes occurred for people with mental illnesses through the development of larger networks of community-based providers and added innovations with regards to payment options from Medicare and Medicaid.&lt;ref name = Accordino /&gt; Despite these advancements, there were many issues associated with the increasing cost of health care.  Community mental health services moved toward a system more similar to managed care as the 1990s progressed.&lt;ref name = Accordino /&gt; Managed care as a system focuses on limiting costs by one of two means: either keeping the total number of patients using services low or reducing the cost of the service itself.&lt;ref name = Accordino /&gt;
Despite the drive for community mental health, many physicians, mental health specialists, and even patients have come to question its effectiveness as a treatment.&lt;ref name = Accordino /&gt; The underlying assumptions of community mental health require that patients who are treated within a community have a place to live, a caring family, or supportive social circle that does not inhibit their rehabilitation.  These assumptions are in fact often wrong.  Many people with mental illnesses, upon discharge, have no family to return to and end up homeless.&lt;ref name = Accordino /&gt;
While there is much to be said for the benefits that community mental health offers, many communities as a whole often harbor negative attitudes toward those with mental illnesses.  Historically, people with mental illnesses have been portrayed as violent or criminal and because of this, "many American jails have become housing for persons with severe mental illnesses arrested for various crimes."&lt;ref name = Accordino /&gt; 
In 1999 the Supreme Court ruled on the case [[Olmstead v. L.C.]]  The Court ruled that it was a violation of the [[Americans with Disabilities Act of 1990]] to keep an individual in a more restrictive inpatient setting, such as a hospital, when a more appropriate and less restrictive community service was available to the individual.&lt;ref name = MPS /&gt;

===21st century and modern trends===
In 2002 President [[George W. Bush]] increased funding for community health centers. The funding aided in the construction of additional centers and increased the number of services offered at these centers, which included healthcare benefits.&lt;ref name = MPS /&gt; In 2003, the [[New Freedom Commission on Mental Health]], established by President Bush, issued a report.  The report was in place to "conduct a comprehensive study of the United States mental health delivery system..." Its objectives included assessing the efficiency and quality of both public and private mental health providers and identifying possible new technologies that could aid in treatment.&lt;ref name = MPS /&gt;
As the 20th century came to a close and the 21st century began, the number of patients diagnosed with a mental health or substance abuse disorder receiving services at community mental health centers grew from 210,000 to approximately 800,000.&lt;ref name=Druss&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Druss |first1=B. |last2=Bornemann |first2=T. |last3=Fry-Johnson |first3=Y. |last4=McCombs |first4=H. |last5=Politzer |first5=R. |last6=Rust |first6=G. |date=October 2006 |title=Trends in Mental Health and Substance Abuse Services at the Nation's Community Health Centers: 1998-2003 |journal=American Journal of Public Health |volume=96 |issue=10 |pages=1779–1784 |pmid=17008573 |pmc=1586130 |doi=10.2105/AJPH.2005.076943 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This nearly four-fold increase shows just how important community mental health centers are becoming to the general population's wellbeing.  Unfortunately, this drastic rise in the number of patients was not mirrored by a concomitant rise in the number of clinicians serving this population.&lt;ref name=Druss /&gt;  The staggering new numbers of patients then are being forced to seek specialized treatment from their primary care providers or hospital emergency rooms.  The unfortunate result of this trend is that when a patient is working with his or her primary care provider, he or she is more likely for a number of reasons to receive less care than with a specialized clinician.&lt;ref name=Druss /&gt; 
Politics and funding have always been and continue to be a topic of contention when it comes to funding of community health centers.  Political views aside, it is clear that these community mental health centers exist largely to aid areas painfully under resourced with psychiatric care.  In 2008, over 17 million people utilized community mental health centers with 35% being insured through Medicaid, and 38% being uninsured.&lt;ref name=Wells&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wells |first1=R. |last2=Morrissey |first2=J. |last3=Lee |first3=I. |last4=Radford |first4=A. |date=2010 |title=Trends in Behavioral Health Care Service Provision by Community Health Centers, 1998-2007 |journal=Psychiatric Services |volume=61 |pages=759–764 |pmid=20675833 |doi=10.1176/ps.2010.61.8.759 |pmc=3415200 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As the 2000s continued, the rate of increase of patients receiving mental health treatment in community mental health centers stayed steady.

=== Purpose and examples ===
Cultural knowledge and attitude is passed from generation to generation. For example, the stigma with therapy may be passed from mother to daughter. [[San Diego]] county has a diverse range of ethnicities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.census.gov/quickfacts/table/PST045215/06073|title=Population estimates, July 1, 2015,  (V2015)|website=www.census.gov|access-date=2016-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the population diversity in San Diego include many groups with [[historical trauma]] and [[Transgenerational trauma|trans-generational trauma]] within those populations. For example, witnesses of war can pass down certain actions and patterns of survival mechanism to generations. Refugee groups have trans-generational trauma around war and [[Posttraumatic stress disorder|PTSD]]. Providing services and therapy to these communities is important because it affects their day to day lives, where their experiences lead to trauma or the experiences are traumatic themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Benjamin|first=Arlene|last2=Carolissen|first2=Ronelle|title="They just block it out": Community counselors’ narratives of trauma in a low-income community.|url=http://doi.apa.org/getdoi.cfm?doi=10.1037/pac0000099|journal=Peace and Conflict: Journal of Peace Psychology|volume=21|issue=3|pages=414–431|doi=10.1037/pac0000099}}&lt;/ref&gt; Knowledge and access to mental health resources are limited in these multicultural communities. Government agencies fund community groups that provide services to these communities. Therefore, this creates a power hierarchy. If their missions do not align with each other, it will be hard to provide benefits for the community, even though the services are imperative to the wellbeing of its residents.&lt;ref&gt;O'Brien, E. R., &amp; Hauser, M. A. (2016). ''Supervision and agency management for counselors: A practical approach''. New York: Springer Publishing Company&lt;/ref&gt;

===Future===
On one hand, despite the field's movement toward community mental health services, currently "insufficient empirical research exists regarding the effectiveness of community treatment programs, and the evidence that does exist does not generalize to all types of community treatment."&lt;ref name = Accordino /&gt; In addition to the fact that community mental health's overall success must be further evaluated, in the times when it has proved effective, very little research exists to help in understanding what exact aspects make it effective.&lt;ref name = Accordino /&gt; Effective and insightful research will be crucial in not only evaluating, but also improving the techniques community mental health utilizes.&lt;ref name = Accordino /&gt;
On the other hand, the demand for and necessity of community mental health is driving it into the future. With this seemingly unrelenting increase in the number of people experiencing mental health illnesses and the number of people reporting these problems, the question becomes what role community mental health services will play. In 2007, almost 5% of adults in the United States reported at least one unmet need for mental health care.  Funding has historically been and continues to be an issue for both the organizations attempting to provide mental health services to a community and the citizens of the community who are so desperately in need of treatment.  The community mental health system's goal is an extremely difficult one and it continues to struggle against changing social priorities, funding deficits, and increasing need.  Community mental health services would ideally provide quality care at a low cost to those who need it most.  In the case of deinstitutionalization, as the number of patients treated increased, the quality and availability of care went down.  With the case of small, private treatment homes, as the quality of the care went up their ability to handle large numbers of patients decreased.  This unending battle for the middle ground is a difficult one but there seems to be hope.  For example, the 2009 Federal Stimulus Package and Health Reform Act have increased the funding for community health centers substantially.&lt;ref name=Wells /&gt; Undoubtedly as community mental health moves forward, there will continue to be a juggling act between clinical needs and standards, political agendas, and funding.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4698">A '''corporate integrity agreement''' (CIA) is a document outlining the obligations that a company involved in [[health care in the United States]] makes with a federal government agency or a state government as part of a [[Settlement (litigation)|civil settlement]]. On the federal level the [[United_States_Department_of_Health_and_Human_Services#Office_of_Inspector_General|Office of Inspector General of the Department of Health and Human Services]] and the [[Department of Justice]] are usually involved, and on the state level, the [[state attorney general]] and the state offices involved in [[Medicaid]] or [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] are involved.&lt;ref name=OIGFAQ&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporate Integrity Agreement FAQ|url=https://oig.hhs.gov/faqs/corporate-integrity-agreements-faq.asp|publisher=Office of Inspector General, Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=14 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

CIAs generally last 5 years. During this time the provider is usually required to implement or expand a comprehensive employee training program, a confidential disclosure program, written standards and policies, and designate a compliance officer and committee if these things are not already done.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporate Integrity Agreements|url=https://oig.hhs.gov/compliance/corporate-integrity-agreements/index.asp|publisher=Office of Inspector General, Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=14 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; CIAs also mandate establishing processes for managing and reporting “reportable events.” Reportable events include overpayments, ongoing investigations or legal proceedings, potential violation of criminal, civil, or administrative laws applicable to any Federal health care program for which penalties or exclusion may be authorized, and employing or contracting with an ineligible person.&lt;ref name=OIGFAQ/&gt;

Some CIAs require an independent organization to review and monitor compliance with the terms and conditions of the CIA. Most CIAs require claims reviews to identify errors and their underlying causes.&lt;ref name=OIGFAQ/&gt;  The government agency may check compliance through site visits.&lt;ref name=OIGFAQ/&gt; If a company breaks the agreement, the agency can fine them and if issues cannot be resolved the provider may be barred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Corporate Integrity Agreement Enforcement|url=https://oig.hhs.gov/fraud/enforcement/ciae/index.asp|publisher=Office of Inspector General, Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=14 April 2018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For people who can access health care practitioners or peer support it is the process whereby persons with long-term conditions (and often family/friend/carer) share knowledge, responsibility and care plans with healthcare practitioners and/or peers. To be effective it requires whole system implementation with community social support networks, a range of satisfying occupations and activities relevant to the context, clinical professionals willing to act as partners or coaches and on-line resources which are verified and relevant to the country and context. Knowledge sharing, [[knowledge building]] and a learning community are integral to the concept of disease management. It is a population health strategy as well as an approach to personal health. It may reduce healthcare costs and/or improve [[quality of life]] for individuals by preventing or minimizing the effects of [[disease]], usually a [[Chronic (medical)|chronic]] condition, through knowledge, skills, enabling a sense of control over life (despite symptoms of disease) and integrative care. On the other hand, it may increase health care costs by causing high implementation costs and promoting the use of costly health care interventions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gandjour |first1=Afschin |title=A model to predict the cost-effectiveness of disease management programs |journal=Health Economics |date=2010 |volume=19 |issue=6 |pages=697-715 |doi=10.1002/hec.1503}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==History==
Disease management has evolved from [[managed care]], specialty capitation, and health service [[demand management]], and refers to the processes and people concerned with improving or maintaining health in large populations. It is concerned with common [[chronic (medicine)|chronic]] illnesses, and the reduction of future complications associated with those diseases.

Illnesses that disease management would concern itself with would include: [[coronary heart disease]], [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), [[kidney failure]], [[hypertension]], [[heart failure]], [[obesity]], [[diabetes mellitus]], [[asthma]], [[cancer]], [[arthritis]], [[clinical depression]], [[sleep apnea]], [[osteoporosis]], and other common ailments.

== Process ==
The underlying premise of disease management is that when the right tools, experts, and equipment are applied to a population, labor costs (specifically: absenteeism, presenteeism, and direct insurance expenses) can be minimized in the near term, or resources can be provided more efficiently. The general idea is to ease the disease path, rather than cure the disease. Improving quality and activities for daily living are first and foremost. Improving cost, in some programs, is a necessary component, as well. However, some disease management systems believe that reductions in longer term problems may not be measureable today, but may warrant continuation of disease management programs until better data is available in 10–20 years. Most disease management vendors offer [[return on investment]] (ROI) for their programs, although over the years there have been dozens of ways to measure ROI. Responding to this inconsistency, an industry trade association, the [[Care Continuum Alliance]], convened industry leaders to develop consensus guidelines for measuring clinical and financial outcomes in disease management, wellness and other population-based programs. Contributing to the work were public and private health and quality organizations, including the federal [[Agency for Healthcare Research and Quality]], the [[National Committee for Quality Assurance]], [[URAC]], and the [[Joint Commission]]. The project produced the first volume of a now four-volume Outcomes Guidelines Report, which details industry-consensus approaches to measuring outcomes.

Tools include web-based assessment tools, clinical guidelines, health risk assessments, outbound and inbound call-center-based triage, best practices, formularies, and numerous other devices, systems and protocols.

Experts include [[actuary|actuaries]], [[physician]]s, [[pharmacist]]s, [[economist|medical economists]], [[nurse]]s, [[nutritionist]]s, [[physical therapist]]s, [[statistician]]s, [[epidemiologist]]s, and [[human resources|human resources professionals]]. Equipment can include mailing systems, web-based applications (with or without interactive modes), monitoring devices, or telephonic systems.

When disease management programs are voluntary, studies of their effectiveness may be affected by a [[self-selection bias]]; that is, a program may "attract enrollees who were [already] highly motivated to succeed".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Kominski GF, etal | date = Mar 2008 | title = The effect of disease management on utilization of services by race/ethnicity: evidence from the Florida Medicaid program | url = http://www.ajmc.com/media/pdf/AJMC_08marKominski_168to172.pdf | format = PDF | journal = American Journal of Managed Care | volume = 14 | issue = 3 | pages = 168–72 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721213630/http://www.ajmc.com/media/pdf/AJMC_08marKominski_168to172.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-21 | df =  | pmid = 18333709 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At least two studies have found that people who enroll in disease management programs differ significantly from those who do not on baseline clinical, demographic, cost, utilization and quality parameters.&lt;ref name="Buntin-2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Who Gets Disease Management? | journal = J Gen Intern Med | volume = 24 | pages = 649–55 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1007/s11606-009-0950-8 | pmid=19308336 | pmc = 2669874  |vauthors=Buntin MB, etal | issue = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Schäfer-2010"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = Selection effects may account for better outcomes of the German Disease Management Program for type 2 diabetes | journal = BMC Health Serv Res | volume = 10 | pages = 351 | year = 2010 | doi = 10.1186/1472-6963-10-351 | pmid = 21194442 | url = http://www.biomedcentral.com/1472-6963/10/351  |vauthors=Schäfer I, etal | pmc = 3023779}}&lt;/ref&gt;  To minimize any bias in estimates of the effectiveness of disease management due to differences in baseline characteristics, [[randomized controlled trial]]s are better than [[observational study|observational studies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Linden A, etal | date = Apr 2006 | title = Strengthening the case for disease management effectiveness: un-hiding the hidden bias | url = http://www.lindenconsulting.org/documents/HiddenBias_Print.pdf | format = PDF | journal = Journal of Evaluation in Clinical Practice | volume = 12 | issue = 2| pages = 140–47 | doi=10.1111/j.1365-2753.2005.00612.x| pmid = 16579822 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if a particular study is a randomized trial, it may not provide strong evidence for the effectiveness of disease management. A 2009 review paper examined randomized trials and meta-analyses of disease management programs for heart failure and asserted that many failed the [[PICO process]] and [[Consolidated Standards of Reporting Trials]]: "interventions and comparisons are not sufficiently well described; that complex programs have been excessively oversimplified; and that potentially salient differences in programs, populations, and settings are not incorporated into analyses."&lt;ref name="Clark-2009"&gt;{{Cite journal | title = What is the strength of evidence for heart failure disease-management programs? | journal = J Am Coll Cardiol | volume = 54 | pages = 397–401 | year = 2009 | doi = 10.1016/j.jacc.2009.04.051 | pmid = 19628113 | url = http://content.onlinejacc.org/cgi/content/full/54/5/397 | issue=5  |vauthors=Clark AM, etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Section 721 of the [[Medicare Prescription Drug, Improvement, and Modernization Act]] of 2003 authorized the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]] (CMS) to conduct what became the "Medicare Health Support" project to examine disease management.&lt;ref name=CMSMHS&gt;Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services.

An initial evaluation of Phase I of the project by [[RTI International]] appeared in June 2007 which had "three key participation and financial findings":&lt;ref name=McCall2007/&gt;
* Medicare expenditures for the intervention group were higher than those of the comparison group by the time the pilots started.
* Within the intervention group, participants had lower Medicare payments (i.e., tended to be healthier) than non-participants.
* The "fees paid to date far exceed any savings produced."
DMAA focused on another finding of the initial evaluation, the "high levels of satisfaction with chronic disease management services among beneficiaries and physicians".&lt;ref&gt;Moorhead, Tracey.

===Other studies===
Studies that have reviewed other studies on the effectiveness of disease management include the following:
* A 2004 [[Congressional Budget Office]] analysis concluded that published studies "do not provide a firm basis for concluding that disease management programs generally reduce total costs".&lt;ref name=CBO/&gt; The report caused the disease management industry to "scrambl[e] to build a better business case for their services".&lt;ref name=Benko&gt;Benko LB.

* A 2007 [[RAND]] summary of 26 reviews and meta-analyses of small-scale disease management programs, and 3 evaluations of population-based disease management programs, concluded that "Payers and policy makers should remain skeptical about vendor claims [concerning disease management] and should demand supporting evidence based on transparent and scientifically sound methods."&lt;ref name=Mattke&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mattke | first1 = S | date = Dec 2007 | title = Evidence for the effect of disease management: is $1 billion a year a good investment? | url = http://www.ajmc.com/media/pdf/AJMC_07dec_Mattke_670to76.pdf | format = PDF | journal = American Journal of Managed Care | volume = 13 | issue = 12 | pages = 670–76 | pmid = 18069910 | last2 = Seid | first2 = M | last3 = Ma | first3 = S | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110721213644/http://www.ajmc.com/media/pdf/AJMC_07dec_Mattke_670to76.pdf | archivedate = 2011-07-21 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; In specific:
** Disease management improved "clinical processes of care" (e.g., adherence to evidence-based guidelines) for congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and depression.
** There was inconclusive evidence, insufficient evidence, or evidence for no effect of disease management on health-related behaviors.
** Disease management led to better disease control for congestive heart failure, coronary artery disease, diabetes, and depression.
** There was inconclusive evidence, insufficient evidence, or evidence for no effect of disease management on clinical outcomes (e.g., "mortality and functional status").
** Disease management reduced hospital admission rates for congestive heart failure, but increased health care utilization for depression, with inconclusive or insufficient evidence for the other diseases studied.
** In the area of financial outcomes, there was inconclusive evidence, insufficient evidence, evidence for no effect, or evidence for increased costs.
** Disease management increased patient satisfaction and health-related quality of life in congestive heart failure and depression, but the evidence was insufficient for the other diseases studied.

'''Domestic medicine''' or '''domestic health care''' is the [[behavior]]al, [[nutrition]]al and [[health care]] practices, hygiene included, performed in the household and transmitted from one generation to the other.

Such knowledge is complementary to the specialized skills of [[physician|doctors]] and [[nurses]]. Consisting of preventive and curative tools, often related to first aid and medical herbs uses, the concept of domestic medicine, was first made popular in [[Western world|Western countries]] by [[Scottish people|Scottish]] physician [[William Buchan (physician)|William Buchan]] in the 18th century, and was spread by domestic economy manuals through the following two hundred years. A prime example of this was Buchan's own ''Domestic Medicine'', a manual for at home health care, broken into sections regarding infant health and general diseases.&lt;ref&gt;Domestic medicine: or, A treatise on the prevention and cure of diseases, by regimen and simple medicines: with an appendix, containing a dispensatory for the use of private practitioners, Philadelphia, 1784&lt;/ref&gt;  The purpose of developing this concept was to expand the reach of medicine so every person can understand it and is able to follow it.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=C.J.|first=Lawrence|year=1975|title=William Buchan: Medicine Laid Open|url=|journal=Medical History|volume=19 |issue=1|pages=20–35|via=|pmid=1095850|pmc=1081607|doi=10.1017/s0025727300019918}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example of such a manual was written by English homeopath [[John Henry Clarke]] in the 19th century, ''A Dictionary of Domestic Medicine and Homeopathic Treatment''.

During the late 18th century, after the publication of William Buchan’s Domestic Medicine, the concept of domestic medicine explored new ideas that changed the way most people perceived medicine. This was an era in which the majority of health care was provided by individuals who were not considered physicians. These people were often close friends, neighbors, or family relatives of the patient. They were not formally trained by modern medical standards of the time but gained their knowledge of medicine by learning from their predecessors. Therefore, the spread of domestic medicinal practices served as a resource for better health care for those who could not afford a physician or did not have access to more technologically advanced practices of medicine. Yet this does not mean that domestic medicine was born with the publication of ''Domestic Medicine''. Domestic medicine has been in practice from as far back as the early colonial era but Buchan’s publication distributed this knowledge out of the hands of the few and to the general public. This was a significant trend as medicine previously had been physician-centered.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Domestic medicine provided a platform for the public to easily access medical care. People from the lower, working-class, in particular, fell under this subgroup of the population who reaped most of the benefits from this style of medicinal practices. Whether it be due to economic reasons, personal preference, or just the fact that no person in their proximity had been trained in modern forms of medicine, they relied on the care from people they trusted. Hence, domestic medicine prompted common folk with a limited knowledge of medicine to care for others using the resources available to them. In many cases, these care givers were mothers as they were in charge of caring for the home and household. Thus, the expansion of domestic medicine played a key role in education not only for the commoner but also women, a group that had previously been limited in their medical involvement. Ironically, though Buchan’s book ended up empowering women, his personal views towards them were less encouraging. He particularly opposed nurses and midwives for prohibiting physicians to treat children or attend births until. He mentioned, “the good women had exhausted all their skill and his [the physicians] attendance could only serve to divide the blame and appease the disconsolate parents.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lawrence|first=C.J.|year=1975|title=Lay Medical Knowledge in the Eighteenth Century: The Evidence of the Gentleman's Magazine|url=|journal=Medical History|volume=29|pages=138–168|via=|doi=10.1017/s0025727300043970|pmc=1139505}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, domestic medicine encompassed a factor which the traditional medical practices ignored.Instead of curing a disease once it has been contracted, this idea of medicine incorporated strategies that promoted health preservation and disease prevention. The belief was that if people could maximize hygiene and cleanliness, they could avoid any type of sickly state and, thus, there would be no need for arduous or uncomfortable remedies. Practices such as frequent hand washing, herbal remedies, washing clothes, good ventilation, and overall cleanliness in the home and occupational settings were widely encouraged. Health was regarded as a natural state in which the human body was in sync with nature; therefore, preserving health was a constant goal of domestic medicine.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Yet, this is not to say that domestic medicine discouraged treatment from physicians. Even though it provided a large number of treatments for different diseases, domestic medicine also knew its limits. When patients contracted diseases that involved more severe symptoms such as extreme fevers or diarrhea, domestic medicine advised patients to go seek professional treatment. This approach worked well as patients would be incentivized to care for daily health and also resort to professional medical treatments when the need arose. It would serve as a balance between everyday disease prevention and professional disease treatment in certain circumstances. Thus, in theory, domestic medicine both empowered individuals and physicians by allowing them to concentrate in separate aspects of healthcare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Rosenberg|first=Charles|year=|title=Medical Text and Social Context: Explaining William Buchan's Domestic Medicine|url=|journal=Explaining Epidemics and Other Studies in the History of Medicine|volume=|pages=32–56|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another benefit that resulted from the use of domestic medicine was the improvement in the population’s education. Early estimates of literacy in the early 1800’s show that nearly a quarter of the U.S. citizens in the north and nearly half of the citizens in the south could not read or write. However, by 1840, this number had shrunk to nearly 9%. The widespread increase in literacy that aided in the distribution of domestic medicine material was substantiated by a separate philosophical thought, called Thomasonian medicine. Unlike domestic medicine, Thomasonian was a more centralized medical concept in which practitioners used herbal remedies and kits only sold by the leaders of the movement. No matter the case, the coevolution of domestic medicine and Thomasonian medicine incentivized reading and writing to the masses.

Another proponent of self-diagnosis of medicine was William Buchan, who authored ''Domestic Medicine'', a widespread book empowering individuals to implement their own care. One aspect of the book that led to its prominence was its novel form.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Previous medical texts fell into two categories: practical use and philosophical implications of bad health. Buchan’s work was able to combine these two genres into a single book meant for common class citizens. William Buchan’s book also aided in the consolidation of medical knowledge as it allowed people to rely on written knowledge rather than knowledge passed by word of mouth.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Since the mid 20th century the success of scientific medicine, associated to the rise of public and private medical services, disrupted most family self-care traditions, decreasing the transfer of most domestic medicine skills from parents to children.

Positive characteristics can be summarized as:
*effective, as preventive and complementary to scientific medicine practices;
*an option for those who can’t afford to pay the price of synthesis drugs;
*they fit a set of external environmental conditions that their users are part of, including solidarity networks;
*they assimilate modern medicine or other traditions, continuously evolving.

Conversely, they are bounded and hampered by lack of resources and remedies are usually bio-chemically mild substances only known and available in small geographical areas.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;''Medicine etniche e tradizionali'', p416, Giorgio V. Brandolini, Macro edizioni, 2008 {{ISBN|978-88-7507-867-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Domestic and non scientific medicines are locally rooted.

Domestic and scientific health care systems, as well as in a patient medical treatment, can harmoniously coexist. The knowledge gap between generations has reduced the appeal of domestic medicine, although its resilience can be ascribed to its links with a "spiritual dimension" of human health. Domestic medicine can reduce the cost of medical treatments, more expensive than prevention, and the risk of [[side effect]]s from [[pharmaceutical drug]]s, and time and cost associated with care recovery.

'''Domestic Medicine'''

Domestic medicine, defined as the use of herbs to treat diseases in the home, can be traced all the way to pre-Columbian cultures and was present even in the early colonial era . This medicine was initially used to treat minor ailments such as headaches and coughs but eventually grew to encompass a multitude of diseases including tuberculosis, indigestion, and even cancer. With growing demand for medication that individuals could implement themselves, a push grew to patent medicines in order to commercialize it without fear of someone else stealing your idea. While some of these patent medicines would come to be viewed as fake, at the time, the growth of patent medicine empowered individuals to implement treatments within their own homes. One of the main proponents of this system was Samuel Thomason who developed an organized a movement meant to distribute herbal medicine. This movement was in response to Thomason's perception that formal medicine was killing patients with the toxic minerals such as calomel, which contains mercury chloride and is used to treat malaria and yellow fever . In contrast, Thomason's system relied on only six treatments and physicians simply had to memorize how to administer the treatments. This universalization of medicine was an especially prominent in the early 1800's when Andrew Jackson was running for president, as he embodied the belief that anyone could run for public office. Medicine followed a similar trend with the development of numerous self-help books meant to deskill medicine for practice by anyone. Not only was medicine deskilled for the use of regular citizens, but the movement also began attacking established medicine, a practice that gained popularity among the people. The public opposed the high level language and the education of physicians, which added to the public's draw toward the Thomson's medicine.

'''Political Environments'''

Furthermore, much attention was drawn to the extreme treatments that these physicians would use to help cure disease. A common practice among physicians was bloodletting as a way to reduce excess blood, which was deduced to be the cause of the disease under the humoral framework. This type of treatment, where the physician is advocating for the removal of excess fluids from the body, was called heroic medicine as the patient required great strength to follow through with these treatments. This democratization of medicine fed into the growth of patent medicine as it created an educated market that demanded medicines. However, without the proper regulatory bodies in place at the time, many vendors advertising panaceas for all kind of diseases, which would, in the best cause scenario, leave the patient with minor discomfort. An example of this the development of the Microbe Killer in response to the discovery of germ theory . This concoction, composed of mostly water with slight traces of hydrochloric acid and sulfuric acid, was designed to be ingested to destroy the germs inside the body. It was not until 1847, when the American Medical Association was founded did an organization emerge to regulate the patent medicine market. With the shift in public opinion on professional physicians, medicine became more of an informal art with few physicians having any certification at all. Most physicians were apprentices to other doctors, but the deterioration in status of the educated physician resulted in minimally-trained people opening medical schools to generate money . In order for these medical schools to recruit students, they started reducing their requirements, even eliminating literacy as a pre-requisite. As a result, these medical schools would provide diplomas and certification even to those without laboratory experience and anatomy.

'''Spread of Knowledge'''

While domestic medicine at its roots was meant to empower the individual, the underlying motive was profit. Take Samuel Thomason, for instance, the founder of the movement towards domestic medicine . Once he had obtained a patent, he spent so much time focused on prosecuting potential knockoffs to his patent that he opposed the democratization of the medicines that he made, so much so that he opposed the development of Thomasonian medical schools. These schools could have been advantages to Samuel Thomason as it would have increased the legitimacy of those who practiced Thomasonian medicine . One positive that came out of this fear of patent violation was Thomason writing The New Guide to Health, as a way to expand the popularity and use of his patent. As a man who boasted on how his medical practice could be practiced by even the illiterate, it is ironic that he chose to publish a book on the topic as it would seem that that was not his target audience. However, this publication became widely popular with 200 institutional holdings of the book and even more in private hands

A '''facial expression'''&lt;ref&gt;Freitas-Magalhães, A. (2011). Facial Expression of Emotion: From Theory to Application. Porto: FEELab Science Books. {{ISBN|978-972-99700-3-0}} &lt;/ref&gt; is one or more motions or positions of the [[muscle]]s beneath the [[skin]] of the face. According to one set of controversial theories, these movements convey the [[emotion]]al state of an individual to observers. Facial expressions are a form of [[nonverbal communication]]. They are a primary means of conveying social information between [[human]]s, but they also occur in most other [[mammals]] and some other animal [[species]]. (For a discussion of the controversies on these claims, see Fridlund&lt;ref name=Fridlund&gt;{{Cite book|author= Alan J. Fridlund|title= Human facial expression|edition= 1 |year= 1994 |publisher= San Diego: Academic Press  |isbn= 978-0-12-267630-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and Russell &amp; Fernandez Dols.&lt;ref name="Russell &amp; Fernandez Dols"&gt;{{Cite book|author1=J. A. Russell |author2=J. M. Fernandez Dols|title= The psychology of facial expression|edition= 1 |year= 1997|publisher= Cambridge University Press |isbn= 978-0-521-58796-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;)

Humans can adopt a facial expression voluntarily or involuntarily, and the neural mechanisms responsible for controlling the expression differ in each case. Voluntary facial expressions are often socially conditioned and follow a cortical route in the brain. Conversely, involuntary facial expressions are believed to be innate and follow a subcortical route in the brain.

Facial recognition is often an emotional experience for the brain and the [[amygdala]] is highly involved in the recognition process.

The eyes are often viewed as important features of facial expressions. Aspects such as blinking rate can possibly be used to indicate whether a person is nervous or whether he or she is lying. Also, [[eye contact]] is considered an important aspect of interpersonal communication. However, there are cultural differences regarding the social propriety of maintaining eye contact or not.

Beyond the accessory nature of facial expressions in spoken communication between people, they play a significant role in communication with [[sign language]]. Many phrases in sign language include facial expressions in the display.

There is controversy surrounding the question of whether facial expressions are worldwide and universal displays among humans. Supporters of the Universality Hypothesis claim that many facial expressions are innate and have roots in evolutionary ancestors. Opponents of this view question the accuracy of the studies used to test this claim and instead believe that facial expressions are conditioned and that people view and understand facial expressions in large part from the social situations around them.

Moreover, the facial expression have strongly connect between the personal psychologic. Some Psychologist have the ability to catch the detail and look for the hidden meaning from person's facial expression.

It is  report data from an experiment that investigated the influence of gaze direction and facial expression on face memory. Participants were shown a set of unfamiliar faces with either happy or angry facial expressions, which were either gazing straight ahead or had their gaze averted to one side. Memory for faces that were initially shown with angry expressions was found to be poorer when these faces had averted as opposed to direct gaze, whereas memory for individuals shown with happy faces was unaffected by gaze direction. It is suggest that memory for another individual's face partly depends on an evaluation of the behavioural intention of that individual &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nakashima|first=Satoshi F|last2=Langton|first2=Stephen R.

=== Facial muscles ===
[[File:Lars Jacob as Comedy &amp; Tragedy 1972.JPG|thumb|An actor acting out ''Drama Masks'' ([[Thalia (Muse)|Thalia]] and [[Melpomene]]) in 1972.]]
Facial expressions are vital to social communication between humans. They are caused by the movement of muscles that connect to the skin and [[fascia]] in the face. These muscles move the skin, creating lines and folds and causing the movement of facial features, such as the mouth and eyebrows. These muscles develop from the second [[pharyngeal arch]] in the embryo. The [[temporalis]], [[masseter]], and [[internal pterygoid muscle|internal]] and [[external pterygoid muscle]]s, which are mainly used for chewing, have a minor effect on expression as well. These muscles develop from the first pharyngeal arch.&lt;ref name="Rinn"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rinn|first=William E.|year=1984|title=The Neuropsychology of Facial Expression: A Review of the Neurological and Psychological Mechanisms for Producing Facial Expressions|journal=Psychological Bulletin|publisher=American Psychological Association, Inc.|volume=95|issue=1|pages=52–77|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.95.1.52}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Neuronal pathways ===
There are two brain pathways associated with facial expression; the first is voluntary expression. Voluntary expression travels from the [[primary motor cortex]] through the [[pyramidal tract]], specifically the [[corticobulbar tract|corticobulbar projections]]. The cortex is associated with display rules in emotion, which are social [[precepts]] that influence and modify expressions. Cortically related expressions are made consciously.&lt;ref name="Rinn" /&gt;

The second type of expression is emotional. These expressions originate from the [[extrapyramidal motor system]], which involves subcortical nuclei. For this reason, genuine emotions are not associated with the cortex and are often displayed unconsciously. This is demonstrated in infants before the age of two; they display distress, disgust, interest, anger, contempt, surprise, and fear. Infants’ displays of these emotions indicate that they are not cortically related. Similarly, blind children also display emotions, proving that they are subconscious rather than learned. Other subcortical facial expressions include the “knit brow” during concentration, raised eyebrows when listening attentively, and short “punctuation” expressions to add emphasis during speech. People can be unaware that they are producing these expressions.&lt;ref name="Rinn" /&gt;

== Neural mechanisms in face perception ==

The amygdala plays an important role in facial recognition. Functional imaging studies have found that when shown pictures of faces, there is a large increase in the activity of the amygdala. The amygdala receives visual information from the thalamus via the subcortical pathways.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Physiology of behavior|year=2010|publisher=Allyn &amp; Bacon|location=Boston|isbn=0-205-66627-2|pages=386–389|edition=10th}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The amygdala may also have a significant role in the recognition of fear and negative emotions. It is believed that the emotion disgust is recognized through activation of the insula and basal ganglia. The recognition of emotion may also utilize the occipitotemporal neocortex, orbitofrontal cortex and right frontoparietal cortices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Adolphs|first=Ralph|title=Neural systems for recognizing emotion|journal=Current Opinion in Neurobiology|date=9 May 2002|volume=12|issue=2|pages=169–177|doi=10.1016/S0959-4388(02)00301-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Gender and facial cues ===
More than anything though, what shapes a child's cognitive ability to detect facial expression is being exposed to it from the time of birth. The more an infant is exposed to different faces and expressions, the more able they are to recognize these emotions and then mimic them for themselves. Infants are exposed to an array of emotional expressions from birth, and evidence indicates that they imitate some facial expressions and gestures (e.g., tongue protrusion) as early as the first few days of life.&lt;ref&gt;(Field, Woodson, Greenberg, &amp; Cohen, 1982; Meltzoff &amp; Moore, 1983)&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2013}} In addition, gender affects the tendency to express, perceive, remember, and forget specific emotions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tay|first=Peter Kay Chai|date=2015-06-22|title=The adaptive value associated with expressing and perceiving angry-male and happy-female faces|journal=Frontiers in Psychology|volume=6|doi=10.3389/fpsyg.2015.00851|issn=1664-1078|pmc=4476135|pmid=26157405}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tay|first=Peter K.

== Communication ==

=== Eye contact ===
{{See also|Eye contact}}
A person's face, especially their eyes, creates the most obvious and immediate cues that lead to the formation of impressions.&lt;ref&gt;Freitas-Magalhães, A. (2007). The Psychology of Emotions: The Allure of Human Face. Oporto: University Fernando Pessoa Press&lt;/ref&gt; This article discusses eyes and facial expressions and the effect they have on [[interpersonal communication]].

A person's eyes reveal much about how they are feeling, or what they are thinking.  Blink rate can reveal how nervous or at ease a person may be.  Research by [[Boston College]] professor Joe Tecce suggests that stress levels are revealed by blink rates. He supports his data with statistics on the relation between the blink rates of presidential candidates and their success in their races.  Tecce claims that the faster blinker in the presidential debates has lost every election since 1980.&lt;ref&gt;"In the blink of an eye." (October 21, 1999). Newsweek.&lt;/ref&gt; Though Tecce's data is interesting, it is important to recognize that [[non-verbal communication]] is multi-channeled, and focusing on only one aspect is reckless.  Nervousness can also be measured by examining each candidates' perspiration, [[eye contact]] and stiffness.&lt;ref name="Rothwell, J. Dan 2004"&gt;Rothwell, J. Dan. In the Company of Others: An Introduction to Communication. United States: McGraw-Hill, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt;

Within their first year, Infants learn rapidly that the looking behaviors of others conveys significant information. Infants prefer to look at faces that engage them in mutual gaze and that, from an early age, healthy babies show enhanced neural processing of direct gaze.&lt;ref name="Eye Contact Detection in Humans From Birth"&gt;[http://www.pnas.org/content/99/14/9602.full Eye Contact Detection in Humans From Birth], PNAS VOL 99 N.14 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

Eye contact is another major aspect of facial communication.  Some have hypothesized that this is due to infancy, as humans are one of the few mammals who maintain regular eye contact with their mother while nursing.&lt;ref&gt;Spitz, Rene A., and Wolf, K. M. "The Smiling Response: A Contribution to the Ontogenesis of Social Relations." Genetic Psychology Monographs. 34 (August 1946). P. 57-125.&lt;/ref&gt; Eye contact serves a variety of purposes. It regulates conversations, shows interest or involvement, and establishes a connection with others.

:Eye contact regulates conversational turn taking, communicates involvement and  interest, manifests warmth, and establishes connections with others…[and] it can command attention, be flirtatious, or seem cold and intimidating… [it] invites conversation. Lack of eye contact is usually perceived to be rude or inattentive.&lt;ref name="Rothwell, J. Dan 2004" /&gt;

But different cultures have [[Eye contact#Cultural differences|different rules for eye contact]].  Certain Asian cultures can perceive direct eye contact as a way to signal competitiveness, which in many situations may prove to be inappropriate.  Others lower their eyes to signal respect, and similarly eye contact is avoided in Nigeria;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=nVgeOxUL3cYC Caring for Patients from Different Cultures], by Geri-Ann Galanti, [https://books.google.com/books?id=nVgeOxUL3cYC&amp;pg=PA34&amp;dq=eye+contact p. 34]&lt;/ref&gt; however, in [[western culture]]s this could be misinterpreted as lacking [[Self-esteem|self-confidence]].

Even beyond the idea of eye contact, eyes communicate more data than a person even consciously expresses. [[Pupil dilation]] is a significant cue to a level of excitement, pleasure, or attraction.  Dilated pupils indicate greater affection or attraction, while constricted pupils send a colder signal.

=== Sign languages ===
Facial expression is used in [[sign language]]s to convey specific meanings. In [[American Sign Language]] (ASL), for instance, raised eyebrows combined with a slightly forward head tilt indicate that what is being signed is a yes/no question. Lowered eyebrows are used for wh-word questions. Facial expression is also used in sign languages to show adverbs and adjectives such as distance or size: an open mouth, squinted eyes, and tilted back head indicate something far while the mouth pulled to one side and the cheek held toward the shoulder indicate something close, and puffed cheeks mean very large. It can also show the manner in which something is done, such as carelessly or routinely.&lt;ref&gt;Baker, Charlotte, and Dennis Cokely (1980). ''American Sign Language: A teacher's resource text on grammar and culture.'' Silver Spring, MD: T.J. Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of these expressions, also called non-manual signs, are used similarly in different sign languages while others are different from one language to another. For example, the expression used for 'carelessly' in ASL means 'boring or unpleasant' in [[British Sign Language]].&lt;ref&gt;Sutton-Spence, Rachel, and [[Bencie Woll]] (1998). ''The linguistics of British Sign Language.'' Cambridge: [[Cambridge University Press]].&lt;/ref&gt;

== Universality hypothesis ==

The universality hypothesis is the assumption that certain facial expressions and face-related acts/ events are signals of specific emotions (happiness with laughter and smiling, sadness with tears, anger with a clenched jaw, fear with a grimace, (or [[Gurn|gurn]])surprise with raised eyebrows and wide eyes along with a slight retraction of the ears, and disgust with a wrinkled nose and squinted eyes—emotions which frequently lack the social component of those like shame, pride, jealousy, envy, deference, etc.) and are recognized by people regardless of culture, language, or time. The belief in the evolutionary basis of these kinds of facial expressions can be traced back to [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]]'s ''[[The Expression of the Emotions in Man and Animals]].'' Reviews of the universality hypothesis have been both supportive&lt;ref name="Ekman, Friesen, Ellsworth"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ekman|first=P.|author2=W. V. Friesen |author3=P.

=== Support ===
[[Paul Ekman|Ekman]]'s work on facial expressions had its starting point in the work of psychologist [[Silvan Tomkins]]. Ekman showed that facial expressions of emotion are not culturally determined, but universal across human cultures.

To demonstrate his universality hypothesis, Ekman ran a test on a group of the South [[Fore people]] of [[New Guinea]], a pre-industrial culture that was isolated from the West. The experiment participants were told brief stories about emotional events (happiness, sadness, anger, fear, surprise, and disgust). After each story, they were asked to select the matching facial expression from an array of three faces.&lt;ref name="Ekman and Friesen"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ekman|first=P.|author2=W. V. Friesen|year=1971|url=http://www.ekmaninternational.com/ResearchFiles/Constants-Across-Cultures-In-The-Face-And-Emotion.pdf|title=Constants across cultures in the face and emotion|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|issue=2|pages=124–129|doi=10.1037/h0030377|pmid=5542557|volume=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Fore selected the ''correct face'' on 64–90% of trials but had difficulty distinguishing the fear face from the surprise face. Children selected from an array of only two faces, and their results were similar to the adults'. Subsequent cross-cultural studies found similar results.&lt;ref name="Ekman et al"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ekman|first=P.|author2=Friesen, W.V. |author3=O'Sullivan, M. |year=1987|title=Universals  and cultural differences in the judgments of facial expressions of emotion|journal=Journal of Personality &amp; Social Psychology |volume=53|issue=4|pages=712–717|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.53.4.712|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The pioneer F-M [[Facial Action Coding System]] 3.0 (F-M FACS 3.0) &lt;ref&gt;Freitas-Magalhães, A. (2018). Facial Action Coding System 3.0: Manual of Scientific Codification of the Human Face.

Since 2003, F-M Group International (F-MGI) has had a FACS certification program for professionals who wish to become FACS (F-M Group International FACS certified coders, F-MGIFCC).

=== Criticism ===

Both sides of this debate agree that the face expresses emotion.  The controversy surrounds the uncertainty about what specific emotional information is read from a facial expression. Opponents of the universality hypothesis believe that more general information is pieced together with other contextual information in order to determine how a person feels.&lt;ref name="Carroll and Russell"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Carroll|first=J. M.|author2=J. A. Russell|year=1996|title=Do facial expressions signal specific emotions? Judging emotion from the face in context|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=70|pages=205–218|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.2.205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One argument against the evidence presented in support of the universality hypothesis is that the method typically used to demonstrate universality inflates recognition scores.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;  Although each factor may contribute only a small amount to the inflation, combined, they can produce exaggerated scores. The three main factors are the following:
* The universality hypothesis focuses on people's abilities to recognize spontaneous facial expressions as they occur naturally. However, the facial expressions used to test this hypothesis are posed. Studies of spontaneous facial expressions are rare and find that participants' recognition of the expressions is lower than that of the corresponding posed expressions.&lt;ref name="Matsumoto"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Matsumoto|first=David|author2=LeRoux, Jeff |author3=Wilson-Cohn, Carida |date=September 2000|title=A New Test to Measure Emotion Recognition Ability: Matsumoto and Ekman's Japanese and Caucasian Brief Affect Recognition Test (JACBART)|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|volume=24|issue=3|pages=179–209|display-authors=etal|url=http://davidmatsumoto.com/content/2000%20A%20New%20Test%20to%20Measure%20Emotion%20Recognition.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Naab and Russell"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Naab|first=P.

* In most studies, participants are shown more than one facial expression (Ekman recommends six of each expression). However, people judge facial expressions relative to others that they have seen,&lt;ref name="Thayer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Thayer|first=Stephen|year=1980|title=The effect of expression sequence and expressor identity on judgments of the intensity of facial expression|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|volume=5|issue=2|pages=71–79|doi=10.1007/bf00986510}}&lt;/ref&gt; and participants who judge more than one facial expression have higher recognition rates than those who judge only one.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;
* The response format that is most commonly used in [[emotion recognition]] studies is [[forced choice]].  In forced choice, for each facial expression, participants are asked to select their response from a short list of emotion labels.  The forced choice method determines the emotion attributed to the facial expressions via the labels that are presented.&lt;ref name="Russell" /&gt;  That is, participants will select the best match to the facial expression even if it is not the emotion label they would have provided spontaneously and even if they would not have labeled the expression as an emotion at all.&lt;ref name="Wagner"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wagner|first=H. L.|year=2000|title=The accessibility of the term "contempt" and the meaning of the unilateral lip curl|journal=Cognition and Emotion|volume=14|pages=689–710|doi=10.1080/02699930050117675|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Evolutionary significance of universality ===
Darwin argued that the expression of emotions has evolved in humans from animal ancestors, who would have used similar methods of expression. Darwin believed that expressions were unlearned and innate in human nature and were therefore evolutionarily significant for survival.  He compiled supporting evidence  from his research on different cultures, on infants, and in other animal species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ekman|first=edited by Paul|title=Darwin and facial expression: a century of research in review|year=2006|publisher=Malor Books|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=1-883536-88-X|pages=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ekman found that people from different cultures recognized certain facial expressions despite vast cultural differences, and his findings tended to confirm Darwin's initial hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Carlson|first=Neil R.|title=Physiology of behavior|year=2012|publisher=Pearson Education Inc.|location=New Jersey|isbn=0-205-23939-0|pages=377|edition=11th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross-cultural studies had shown that there are similarities in the way emotions are expressed across diverse cultures, but studies have even shown that there are similarities between species in how emotions are expressed. Research has shown that chimpanzees are able to communicate many of the same facial expressions as humans through the complex movements of the facial muscles. In fact, the facial cues were so similar that Ekman's [[Facial Action Coding System]] could be applied to the chimps in evaluating their expressions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vick|first=Sarah-Jane|author2=Waller, Bridget M., Parr, Lisa A., Smith Pasqualini, Marcia C., Bard, Kim A.|title=A Cross-species Comparison of Facial Morphology and Movement in Humans and Chimpanzees Using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS) 
|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|date=15 December 2006|volume=31|issue=1|pages=18|doi=10.1007/s10919-006-0017-z|pmid=21188285|pmc=3008553}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of course, differences between the species' physical facial properties, such as white sclera and everted lips in chimps, would mean that some expressions could not be compared.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vick|first=Sarah-Jane|author2=Waller, Bridget M., Parr, Lisa A., Smith Pasqualini, Marcia C., Bard, Kim A.|title=A Cross-species Comparison of Facial Morphology and Movement in Humans and Chimpanzees Using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS)|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|date=15 December 2006|volume=31|issue=1|pages=16|doi=10.1007/s10919-006-0017-z|pmid=21188285|pmc=3008553}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, Darwin observed that infants' method of expression for certain emotions was instinctive, as they were able to display emotional expressions they had not themselves yet witnessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Russell|first=James|title=Is There Universal Recognition of Emotion From Facial Expression?  A Review of the Cross-Cultural Studies|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=1994|volume=115|pages=102–141|pmid=8202574|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.115.1.102|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Facial morphology impacts expression recognition in important ways, and therefore, infant facial morphology may also serve some specific communicative function. These similarities in morphology and movement are important for the correct interpretation of an emotion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Vick|first=Sarah-Jane|author2=Waller, Bridget M., Parr, Lisa A., Smith Pasqualini, Marcia C., Bard, Kim A.|title=A Cross-species Comparison of Facial Morphology and Movement in Humans and Chimpanzees Using the Facial Action Coding System (FACS)|journal=Journal of Nonverbal Behavior|date=15 December 2006|volume=31|issue=1|pages=17|doi=10.1007/s10919-006-0017-z|pmid=21188285|pmc=3008553}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Darwin was particularly interested in the functions of facial expression as evolutionarily important for survival. He looked at the functions of facial expression in terms of the utility of expression in the life of the animal and in terms of specific expressions within species. Darwin deduced that some animals communicated feelings of different emotional states with specific facial expressions. He further concluded that this communication was important for the survival of animals in group-dwelling species; the skill to effectively communicate or interpret another animal's feelings and behaviors would be a principal trait in naturally fit species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Ekman|first=edited by Paul|title=Darwin and facial expression : a century of research in review|year=2006|publisher=Malor Books|location=Cambridge, Massachusetts|isbn=1-883536-88-X|pages=12–14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, this suggests that solitary species such as [[orang-utan]]s would not exhibit such expressions.

'''Faith''' is a fictional character created by [[Joss Whedon]] for the television series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]''. Played by actress [[Eliza Dushku]], Faith was introduced in the [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (season 3)|third season]] of ''Buffy'' and was a focus of that season's overarching plot. She returned for shorter [[story arc]]s on ''Buffy'' and its spinoff ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''. The character's story is continued in the comic book series ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eight]]'', and she also appears in [[apocrypha (fiction)|apocryphal]] material in other comic books and novels. Faith was set to receive her own spinoff television series after the final season of ''Buffy'', but Dushku declined the offer and the series was never made. The character later costarred in the 25-issue comic book ''Angel &amp; Faith'' beginning in August 2011; under the banner of ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine]]'', the story took place mostly in London and the surrounding area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comicbookresources.com/?page=article&amp;id=31615|title=WC11 EXCLUSIVE: Gage is Touched by "Angel &amp; Faith"|work=Comic Book Resources|date=April 1, 2011|accessdate=April 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Seven years after her creation, Whedon gave Faith the surname Lehane for a [[role-playing game]] and subsequent material. The last issue of ''Season Eight'' was the first official canon source to refer to Faith by her full name.

Faith is a [[Slayer (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Slayer]]: a girl endowed with supernatural abilities and destined to battle evil creatures like [[Vampire (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|vampires]] and [[Demon (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|demons]]. Created as a [[foil (literature)|foil]] to series [[protagonist]] [[Buffy Summers]], Faith is a slayer from a damaged background who often makes the wrong decision. Events take a toll on Faith's sanity and she slips from being an ally to the main characters into a more villainous role. In later storylines she feels remorse for her past crimes, and with the help of the benevolent vampire [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] she eventually rejoins the side of good, hoping to achieve redemption.

Following ''Season Eight'', Faith received her own title in ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine|Angel &amp; Faith]]'' (2011-2013), a companion series to ''Season Nine''. The story depicts Angel and Faith residing in Giles' London home, attending to his unfinished business and fighting the forces of evil in the city, while Angel pursues a covert plan to resurrect Giles. Faith mentors a group of slayers, but those relationships are strained by her friendship with Angel. Ultimately, the group averts the apocalypse, and resurrects Giles, as a young boy. The story ends with Faith taking some time alone to find herself. She is next seen in ''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Ten]]'' (2014-2016) when she brings Giles to reconnect with Buffy, and is hurt when Giles tells her that Buffy is his first priority. In the second volume of ''Angel &amp; Faith'', Faith finds a home in [[Kennedy (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Kennedy]]'s [[private security]] slayer firm, and is troubled by a mission to rescue [[Riley Finn]], whom she slept with while posing as Buffy years ago. She eventually returns to London to fight alongside Angel against the ancient demon Archaeus, who had been terrorizing the city.

==Concept and creation==
{{Quote_box|width=30%|align=right|quote="I know Faith's not going to be on the cover of ''Sanity Fair'', but... she had it rough. Different circumstances, that could be me."|source=—Buffy empathizes with Faith in "[[Doppelgangland]]", echoing the intended parallels between the two Slayers.}}The initial concept for Faith's character was "the road not taken", a Slayer who makes the wrong choices in life.&lt;ref name=S3Overview&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Joss Whedon]], [[Jane Espenson]], [[Marti Noxon]], [[Eliza Dushku]]|title="Season 3 Overview" (''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer DVDs#Season 3|The Complete Third Season]] DVD Special Features)|medium=DVD (Region 2)|location=United States|publisher=20th Century Fox|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is intended to be a reflection of what Buffy could have become were it not for her support system of friends and family.&lt;ref name=S3Overview/&gt; The question the writers wanted to answer was, how would upbringing and environment affect the type of people they would become later in life?&lt;ref name=S3Overview/&gt; Whedon describes her as everything Buffy would never let herself become; although Buffy is tempted by Faith's approach to slaying, she ultimately decides not to make the same choices herself.&lt;ref name=S3Overview/&gt; Some fans argue that the show developed a lesbian [[subtext]] for Faith and Buffy; writer [[Jane Espenson]] says Whedon didn't intend this, but admitted it was there after he had it pointed out to him, jokingly attributing this to his subconscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.afterelton.com/blog/michaeljensen/live-chat-with-jane-espenson|title=Live Chat with Jane Espenson|last=Jensen|first=Michael|work=AfterElton.com|date=March 19, 2009|accessdate=August 15, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With Faith, the writers explored the nature of power and the boundaries and consequences of its use. They wanted to address the issue that regardless of whether the creatures a Slayer kills are good or evil, she is still a professional killer.&lt;ref name=S3Overview/&gt; Co-executive producer [[Doug Petrie]], writer of Faith-centric episodes such as "[[Revelations (Buffy episode)|Revelations]]" and "[[Bad Girls (Buffy episode)|Bad Girls]]", says one thing he loves about the character is that Faith is not wrong to describe herself and Buffy as killers. He notes that Faith believes her contributions to society relieve her of any legal or moral responsibilities, a view which Buffy does not share.&lt;ref name=S3Overview/&gt; When writing Faith, Petrie looked to [[Frank Miller (comics)|Frank Miller]]'s violent [[Marvel Comics]] character [[Elektra (comics)|Elektra Natchios]] for inspiration, claiming that "in a different, teen, punkier context, Faith is so much like Elektra."&lt;ref name=MonsterBook&gt;{{cite book|last=Golden|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Golden |author2=[[Stephen R. Bissette]] |author3=[[Thomas E. Sniegoski]]|title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Monster Book|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2000|location=New York|pages=VI|isbn=978-0-671-04259-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the series ended, Faith got a surname in 2005. When Whedon was asked by Eden Studios to create Faith and Kendra surnames for a [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (roleplaying game)|''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' role-playing game]], he chose Lehane for Faith because he wanted something [[South Boston|Southie]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Joss Whedon]] announced in January 2005 that Faith's surname was "Lehane," and this would be used in all future products, starting with Eden Studios' [[Buffyverse role-playing games|''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' role-playing game]] . The name appears in Eden's books and is considered to be [[canon (fiction)|canonical]]. Whedon explained at the time:
: ''There was this role playing game or something. They said she hadda have a last name for her so I chose Lehane 'cause I wanted something [[South Boston|Southie]], just as you thought.'' — [http://whedonesque.com/?comments=5682#47049 Joss Whedon at whedonesque.com]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Characterization==
Actress Dushku describes Faith as the working class Slayer, a reason she feels so many people identify with her.&lt;ref name=S3Overview/&gt; She was written as a sympathetic character. Petrie claims "I connected with Faith early on. I love that character. She's totally tragic." According to him, "the whole key to Faith is that she's in pain. If you took that away, she would be a monster. But she's so lonely and so desperate, and all of her toughness comes out of trying to cover that. That's what real monsters are made of. No one thinks they're really a monster."&lt;ref name=MonsterBook368/&gt; Petrie says Faith's main motivation is to find a family and friends; she sees treacherous watcher Gwendolyn Post as the mother she never had, the Scooby Gang as the friends she never had, and the mayor as the father she never had. "She's always looking for a family and always coming up short and making these horrible choices, and it drove her insane," he says. "Plus I think she was missing a couple of screws to begin with. 'If you don't love me, you will fear me,' is kind of her [[modus operandi|m.o]]. She's not a stable girl, but a fun one."&lt;ref name=MonsterBook368/&gt; Petrie describes the character's name as "wildly ironic" due to her cynical nature. "She's the most faithless character we've got. She doesn't trust herself or anyone around her. We try to do that a lot with our monsters. It's much more fun if you look at it from their point of view."&lt;ref name=MonsterBook368&gt;{{cite book|last=Golden|first=Christopher|authorlink=Christopher Golden |author2=[[Stephen R. Bissette]] |author3=[[Thomas E. Sniegoski]]|title=Buffy the Vampire Slayer: The Monster Book|publisher=Pocket Books|year=2000|location=New York|pages=368–369|isbn=978-0-671-04259-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writer Espenson thinks one reason why Faith elicits sympathy is the touching father/daughter relationship between her and the mayor, and compares their affection with that between vampires [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] and [[Drusilla (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Drusilla]] in the earlier season. The writers wanted to make both Faith and the mayor as human as possible by showing their need for connection and love as passionate as the heroic characters. Dushku asserts that Faith's bond with the Mayor is due to his being one of the few people in her life who doesn't put her down, which is something she battled with her whole life. Dushku goes on to say Faith's misplaced trust in the Mayor "leads her into being more crazy".&lt;ref name=S3Overview/&gt;

In the ''Angel'' season one episode "[[Sanctuary (Angel episode)|Sanctuary]]", Faith bonds with vampire-with-a-soul Angel; executive producer David Greenwalt explains Angel can help because he's able to understand her suffering and to help her atone for her sins.&lt;ref name=FeaturetteS1&gt;{{cite video|people=[[David Greenwalt]]|title="Featurette: Season 1" (''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' [[Angel DVDs#Season 1|The Complete First Season]] DVD Special Features)|medium=DVD (Region 2)|location=United States|publisher=20th Century Fox|date=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Faith returns the favor in ''Angel''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;s fourth season, when she's the only one determined to defeat his soulless alter ego Angelus without killing Angel in the process. Actor Boreanaz explains, "I think having a character like Faith come back at a pivotal point when she finds out Angelus is loose is really, for her character, a way of saying: 'I'm paying you back, Angel, for saving me, therefore, I'm gonna save you.'" The writers found it an interesting dynamic to have former bad girl Faith play an heroic role against the villainous protagonist Angel.&lt;ref name=S4Overview&gt;{{cite video|people=[[David Boreanaz]], [[David Fury]]|title="Prophecies: Season 4 Overview" (''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' [[Angel DVDs#Season 4|The Complete Fourth Season]] DVD Special Features)|medium=DVD (Region 2)|location=United States|publisher=20th Century Fox|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Faith came back for the final season of ''Buffy'' because, according to David Solomon, "she had been such a crucial character at a very specific junction in the series that there would be no way to tie it up without her." Yet the season seven dynamic between the two Slayers has changed. As Rebecca Rand Kirshner explains, Faith is "no longer such a complete opposite of Buffy. And there's sort of a subtler and more complicated dynamic between them". As Buffy fights her unwanted role as mentor to the Potential Slayers, the writers used Faith to create an outside conflict about Buffy's leadership abilities. Although she questions Buffy and the choices she makes, Faith is no longer her enemy. In the episode "[[Empty Places]]", when the Potentials lose trust in Buffy and appoint Faith as their leader, the decision literally blows up in their faces. As Drew Goddard explains, "Faith is like the cool aunt that everyone loves, because the cool aunt doesn't have the responsibility of raising the children. She just gets to show up and have fun. The problem is, Faith is not ready to lead. She's damaged in her own way. She's just beginning to pull herself together. As much as she wants to be Buffy, she has to learn how to become Faith."&lt;ref name=S7Overview&gt;{{cite video|people=[[Joss Whedon]], [[Drew Goddard]], [[David Solomon (producer)|David Solomon]], [[Rebecca Rand Kirshner]]|title="Season 7 Overview – Buffy: Full Circle" (''[[Buffy the Vampire Slayer (TV series)|Buffy the Vampire Slayer]]'' [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer DVDs#Season 7|The Complete Seventh Season]] DVD Special Features)|medium=DVD (Region 2)|location=United States|publisher=20th Century Fox|date=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When writing ''Go Ask Malice'', author Levy encountered a number of issues when writing a backstory for Faith; one was retaining the character's mystery. Levy felt many aspects of Faith's background, such as her delinquency and promiscuity, could be intuited by the show's viewers, and he didn't want to spell everything out in some kind of case study. To do something nontraditional, Levy told the story in a diary format, watching many episodes of the series to get a feel for the cadence of her voice. He looked to Faith's own personality to overcome his fear of writing such a popular character. "She's not hesitant and in a lot of ways, I took a lot of inspiration from the character itself in terms of creative process — to really go for it and be strong in my choices".&lt;ref name=LevyInterview/&gt;

'''Go Mi-young''', ({{korean|고미영|高美英}} : March 3, 1967 &amp;ndash; July 11, 2009) was a [[South Korea]]n female [[mountaineer]].

The '''Health Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal''' of [[New Zealand]] hears and determines disciplinary proceedings brought against health practitioners.

The Tribunal was created by section 84 Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.legislation.govt.nz/act/public/2003/0048/latest/whole.html |title=Health Practitioners Competence Assurance Act 2003 No 48 (as at 01 August 2011), Public Act – New Zealand Legislation  |work=legislation.govt.nz |year=2011 |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and established 18 September 2004. It supersedes the [[Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal]] of New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mpdt.org.nz/ |title=Medical Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal |work=mpdt.org.nz |year=2011 |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tribunal is administered by the [[Ministry of Health (New Zealand)|Ministry of Health]] and covers a range of professions including medical professions ([[medical practitioners]], [[nurses]] and [[midwives]]), dental professions ([[dentists]], [[dental therapists]], [[dental hygienists]]), [[pharmacists]], [[osteopaths]], and [[chiropractors]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.hpdt.org.nz/ |title=Health Practitioners Disciplinary Tribunal|work=hpdt.org.nz |year=2011 |accessdate=18 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Health Services Union''' (HSU) is a specialist health [[trade union|union]] with around 70,000 members working in the healthcare and social assistance industries across [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://hsu.net.au/about-us/|title=About Us|publisher=[[HSU National]]|accessdate=16 November 2015|date=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The membership of the union includes [[physician|doctors]], and allied health professionals such as [[physiotherapy|physiotherapists]] and [[radiography|radiographers]], [[ambulance]] officers, clerical and administrative staff, managers and support staff.

The HSU National Office is located in [[Melbourne, Victoria]]. Its current National Secretary is Chris Brown.

==Branch structure==
The HSU is a federated union, with branches in every state and territory of Australia. Each branch of the HSU covers different workers depending on the state they reside, their workplace and their occupation. Below is a list of the nine branches of the HSU.
* HSU NSW/ACT
* HSU QLD
* HSU SA/NT
* HSU TAS (trading as the Health and Community Services Union - HACSU)
* HSU VIC No. 1 (trading as the Health Workers Union - HWU)
* HSU VIC No. 2 (trading as the Health and Community Services Union - HACSU)
* HSU VIC No. 3 (trading as the [[Victorian Allied Health Professionals Association]] - VAHPA)
* HSU VIC No. 4 (trading as the Medical Scientists Association of Victoria; Victorian Psychologists Association and; Association of Hospital Pharmacists)
* HSU WA

==History==
The union officially came into existence in 1991 with the amalgamation of two existing unions, the Hospital Employees' Federation (HEF) and The Health and Research Employees Association (HREA).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The HSU: anatomy of a Labor nightmare|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-05-03/the-hsu-anatomy-of-a-labor-nightmare/3986558|work=ABC News|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=4 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  But its origins date back to the early years of the twentieth century when organisations of [[hospital]] employees were first formed in [[Australia]].

Over the years the membership of the unions that eventually came together to form the HSU has been based around a nucleus of hospital staff and [[psychiatric]] care staff. But it has gone much further to include ambulance, [[aged care]], [[community health]], [[disability]] sector, hospital [[scientists]], [[mind|mental]] health and [[drug abuse|drug]] and [[alcohol]] workers.

=== Financial controversy ===
{{main|Health Services Union expenses affair}}
A former HSU national Secretary, [[Craig Thomson (politician)|Craig Thomson]], faced allegations from 2008&lt;ref name="Thomson suspended"&gt;[http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-04-29/craig-thomson-leaves-labor-party/3978614 "Embattled Thomson suspended from Labor Party"]. ''ABC News'' [[Australian Broadcasting Corporation]], 29 April 2012. Retrieved 7 May 2012 (updated)&lt;/ref&gt; that he used an HSU union credit card to pay for [[Call girl|escorts]] and other financial improprieties with the card. Amid the allegations, the [[Australian Council of Trade Unions]] (ACTU) suspended the HSU's membership.&lt;ref name="ACTU suspends HSU"&gt;{{cite news|title=ACTU suspends Health Services Union|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-04-05/actu-suspends-health-services-union/3935476|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|accessdate=7 May 2012|newspaper=ABC News|date=5 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thomson maintains his innocence, but in May 2012, a report by [[Fair Work Australia]] recommended that [[civil court]] action be taken against Thomson for what the report says was a "substantial misuse of members' funds".&lt;ref name="Fair work report"&gt;{{cite news|last=Wright|first=Jessica|title=Fair Work moves on Thomson over 'misuse' of HSU funds and escort services|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/fair-work--moves-on-thomson-over-misuse-of-hsu-funds-and-escort-services-20120507-1y86c.html|accessdate=7 May 2012|newspaper=Sydney Morning Herald|date=7 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 January 2013, Thomson was arrested and was expected to face 150 fraud charges in Wyong Local Court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Craig Thomson arrested by fraud squad|url=http://www.smh.com.au/opinion/political-news/craig-thomson-arrested-by-fraud-squad-20130131-2dmnn.html|work=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=31 January 2013|accessdate=|author=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12228">'''Health human resources''' ('''HHR''') – also known as '''human resources for health''' ('''HRH''') or '''health workforce''' – is defined as "all people engaged in actions whose primary intent is to enhance health", according to the [[World Health Organization]]'s [[World Health Report|''World Health Report 2006'']].&lt;ref name="WHR2006"&gt;World Health Organization. ''The world health report 2006: working together for health'', Geneva, 2006 – http://www.who.int/whr/2006&lt;/ref&gt; Human resources for health are identified as one of the core building blocks of a [[health system]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/healthsystems/topics/en/index.html Health Systems Topics.] Geneva. &lt;/ref&gt; They include [[physicians]], [[nurses|nursing professionals]], [[midwives]], [[dentists]], [[allied health professions]], [[community health worker]]s, social health workers and other [[health care provider]]s, as well as health management and support personnel – those who may not deliver services directly but are essential to effective health system functioning, including [[health administration|health services managers]], [[health information management|medical records and health information technicians]], health economists, health supply chain managers, medical secretaries and others. 

The field of health human resources deals with issues such as [[workforce planning|planning]], development, performance, [[human resource management|management]], [[employee retention|retention]], information, and research on [[human resources]] for the [[health care]] sector. In recent years, raising awareness of the critical role of HRH in strengthening health system performance and improving population health outcomes has placed the health workforce high on the [[global health]] agenda.&lt;ref&gt;Grepin K, Savedoff WD. "10 Best Resources on ... health workers in developing countries." ''Health Policy and Planning'', 2009; 24(6):479–482 http://heapol.oxfordjournals.org/cgi/content/full/24/6/479&lt;/ref&gt;

== Global situation ==
[[Image:SOWM2010 critical shortage.svg|thumb|Nations identified with critical shortages of health care workers]]
The World Health Organization (WHO) estimates a shortage of almost 4.3 million physicians, midwives, nurses and support workers worldwide.&lt;ref name="WHR2006"/&gt; The shortage is most severe in 57 of the poorest countries, especially in sub-Saharan Africa. The situation was declared on [[World Health Day|World Health Day 2006]] as a "health workforce crisis" – the result of decades of underinvestment in health worker education, training, [[wage]]s, working environment and management. 

Shortages of skilled for health workers are also reported in many specific care areas. For example, there is an estimated shortage of 1.18 million [[mental health professional]]s, including 55,000 psychiatrists, 628,000 nurses in mental health settings, and 493,000 psychosocial care providers needed to treat mental disorders in 144 low- and middle-income countries.&lt;ref&gt;Scheffler RM et al. ''Human resources for mental health: workforce shortages in low- and middle-income countries''. Geneva, World Health Organization, 2011 – available on http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2011/9789241501019_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Shortages of [[birth attendant|skilled birth attendants]] in many developing countries remains an important barrier to improving [[maternal health]] outcomes. Many countries, both developed and developing, report maldistribution of skilled health workers leading to [[Health care provider#Shortages of health professionals|shortages in rural and underserved areas]].

Regular statistical updates on the global health workforce situation are collated in the WHO ''Global Health Observatory''.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. [http://www.who.int/gho/health_workforce/en/ ''Global Health Observatory (GHO) data: Health workforce.''] Geneva. Accessed 8 Aug 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the evidence base remains fragmented and incomplete, largely related to weaknesses in the underlying [[HRHIS|human resource information systems]] (HRIS) within countries.&lt;ref&gt;Dal Poz MR et al. (eds). ''Handbook on monitoring and evaluation of human resources for health'', Geneva, World Health Organization, 2009 – available on http://www.who.int/hrh/resources/handbook/en/index.html&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to learn from best practices in addressing health workforce challenges and strengthening the evidence base, an increasing number of HHR practitioners from around the world are focusing on issues such as HHR advocacy, surveillance and collaborative practice. Some examples of global HRH partnerships include:

* [http://www.who.int/hrh/network/en/ Global Health Workforce Network]

== Research ==
Health workforce research is the investigation of how social, economic, organizational, political and policy factors affect access to health care professionals, and how the organization and composition of the workforce itself can affect health care delivery, quality, [[health equity|equity]], and costs. 

Many government [[health department]]s, academic institutions and related agencies have established research programs to identify and quantify the scope and nature of HHR problems leading to [[health policy]] in building an innovative and sustainable health services workforce in their jurisdiction. Some examples of HRH information and research dissemination programs include:

== Policy and planning ==
In some countries and jurisdictions, health workforce planning is distributed among [[Labour economics|labour market]] participants. In others, there is an explicit [[health policy|policy or strategy]] adopted by governments and systems to plan for adequate numbers, distribution and quality of health workers to meet health care goals. For one, the [[International Council of Nurses]] reports:&lt;ref&gt;International Council of Nurses. ''Health human resources planning''. Geneva, 2008 – {{cite web |url=http://www.ichrn.com/publications/factsheets/Health-Human-Resources-Plan_EN.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-04-12 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120322161502/http://www.ichrn.com/publications/factsheets/Health-Human-Resources-Plan_EN.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;The objective of HHRP [health human resources planning] is to provide the right number of health care workers with the right knowledge, skills, attitudes, and qualifications, performing the right tasks in the right place at the right time to achieve the right predetermined health targets.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An essential component of planned HRH targets is [[supply and demand]] modeling, or the use of appropriate data to link population health needs and/or health care delivery targets with human resources supply, distribution and [[workforce productivity|productivity]]. The results are intended to be used to generate evidence-based policies to guide workforce sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;Dal Poz MR et al. ''Models and tools for health workforce planning and projections.'' Geneva, World Health Organization, 2010 – http://whqlibdoc.who.int/publications/2010/9789241599016_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Health Canada. [http://www.hc-sc.gc.ca/hcs-sss/hhr-rhs/strateg/index-eng.php ''Health Human Resource Strategy (HHRS)''.] Accessed 12 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In resource-limited countries, HRH planning approaches are often driven by the needs of targeted programmes or projects, for example, those responding to the [[Millennium Development Goals]] or, more recently, the [[Sustainable Development Goals]].&lt;ref&gt;Dreesch N et al. "An approach to estimating human resource requirements to achieve the Millennium Development Goals." ''Health Policy and Planning'', 2005; 20(5):267–276.&lt;/ref&gt;

The WHO ''Workload Indicators of Staffing Need'' (WISN) is an HRH planning and management tool that can be adapted to local circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization. ''Workload Indicators of Staffing Need (WISN): User's manual.'' Geneva, 2010 – http://www.who.int/hrh/resources/wisn_user_manual/en/ &lt;/ref&gt; It provides health managers a systematic way to make staffing decisions in order to better manage their human resources, based on a health worker's [[workload]], with activity (time) standards applied for each workload component at a given health facility.

===Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel===
The main international policy framework for addressing shortages and maldistribution of health professionals is the ''Global Code of Practice on the International Recruitment of Health Personnel'', adopted by the WHO's 63rd [[World Health Assembly]] in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;''International recruitment of health personnel: global code of practice.'' Resolution adopted by the Sixty-third World Health Assembly, Geneva, May 2010 – available on http://apps.who.int/gb/e/e_wha63.html&lt;/ref&gt; The Code was developed in a context of increasing debate on international health worker recruitment, especially in some higher income countries, and its impact on the ability of many developing countries to deliver [[primary health care]] services. Although non-binding on the Member States and recruitment agencies, the Code promotes principles and practices for the ethical international recruitment of health personnel. It also advocates the strengthening of health personnel information systems to support effective health workforce policies and planning in countries.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="18689">'''Infant and toddler safety''' are those actions and modifications put into place to keep babies and toddlers safe from accidental injury and death. Many accidents, injuries and deaths are preventable.&lt;ref name = aapfurn&gt;{{cite web | publisher = American Academy of Pediatrics | first = Lois| last = Lee| url = https://www.aap.org/en-us/aap-voices/Pages/How-a-Hole-in-the-Wall-Can-Save-a-Childs-Life.aspx | title = How a Hole in the Wall Can Save a Child's Life | date = 6 July 2017| accessdate = 27 July 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Infants begin to crawl around six to nine months of age. When they crawl, they are exposed to many dangers. Anticipating the development of the baby and toddler aids caregivers in identifying hazards before they are discovered by the child.&lt;ref name=NIH2017&gt;{{cite web|title=Making Your Home Safe For Baby|url=https://www.womenshealth.gov/pregnancy/getting-ready-baby/making-your-home-safe-baby|publisher = Office on Women’s Health, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services|accessdate=17 July 2017|date=1 February 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General recommendations==
US government agencies recommend that caregivers take the following precautions:

* Covering all unused electrical sockets with outlet plugs.
* Keeping cords out of baby's reach. Tack up cords to vertical blinds and move furniture, lamps, or electronics to hide cords.
* Securing furniture and electronics, such as bookcases and TVs, so they cannot be pulled down on top of the baby.
* Using protective padding to cover sharp edges and corners, such as from a coffee table or fireplace hearth.
* Installing safety gates at the bottom and top of stairwells or to block entry to unsafe rooms.
* Using safety latches on cabinets and doors.
* Storing all medicines, cleaning products, and other poisons out of the baby's reach.
* Removing rubber tips from doorstops or replace with one-piece doorstops.
* Looking for and removing all small objects. Objects that easily can pass through the center of a toilet paper roll might cause choking.
* Keeping houseplants out of the baby's reach. Some plants can poison or make your babies sick.
* Setting the water heater temperature to no higher than 125 degrees Fahrenheit. Water that is hotter can cause bad burns.
* Closely supervising the baby around pets. Even family pets have been know to harm familiar children.&lt;ref name=NIH2017/&gt;

==Furniture==
Toddlers typically enjoy [[climbing]] up things with steps. This includes [[furniture]]. Heavy furniture in the home is often not secured to the wall. These pieces of furniture can include [[bookcase]]s and [[dressing table|dressers]] that can weigh hundreds of pounds. Heavy objects like televisions that are on the furniture can also fall onto the child. If the toddler climbs up the furniture it is likely to fall onto the child. This has resulted in the deaths and injuries of children. Even if the children appears uninjured, it is possible that [[internal injuries]] have occurred with serious consequences. Often these injuries are not apparent to caregivers and as a consequence treatment can be delayed. Serious head injuries have also occurred.&lt;ref name = aapfurn/&gt;

Caregivers can prevent accidents related to furniture by securring the furniture to the wall. Placing heavier objects into the lowest drawers. Not placing toys on top of the furniture. Constantly monitoring the activities of the toddler. Putting drawer stops onto the drawers to prevent the toddler from opening the drawer. Mount flat-screen televisions out-of-reach and onto the wall.&lt;ref name = aapfurn/&gt;

==Lead poisoning==
{{See|Lead poisoning}}
No safe levels of lead in the body of a child is considered safe and can cause problems for the rest of their life.&lt;ref name=CDC2012&gt;{{cite web|title=Advisory Committee On Childhood Lead Poisoning Prevention (ACCLPP)|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/ACCLPP/acclpp_main.htm|publisher=CDC|accessdate=18 May 2012|date=May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children living in low-income families are more likely to have levels of lead in their bodies. Questions regarding the testing procedures have been called into question.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.aap.org/en-us/about-the-aap/aap-press-room/Pages/Study-Improvement-Needed-to-Accurately-Detect-Precise-Levels-of-Lead-in-Blood.aspx | title=Study: Improvement Needed to Accurately Detect Precise Levels of Lead in Blood}}&lt;/ref&gt; Children are at greater risk as they are more likely to put objects in their mouth such as those that contain [[lead paint]] and absorb a greater proportion of the lead that they eat.&lt;ref name=WHO2016&gt;{{cite web|title=Lead poisoning and health|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs379/en/|website=WHO|accessdate=14 October 2016|date=September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Treatment is available but prevention is better.&lt;ref name=Dap2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=What Do Parents Need to Know to Protect Their Children?|url=https://www.cdc.gov/nceh/lead/acclpp/blood_lead_levels.htm|website=CDC|accessdate=14 October 2016|date=30 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Gra2007&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gracia|first1=RC|last2=Snodgrass|first2=WR|title=Lead toxicity and chelation therapy.|journal=American Journal of Health-System Pharmacy|date=1 January 2007|volume=64|issue=1|pages=45–53|pmid=17189579|doi=10.2146/ajhp060175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Dap2014&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dapul|first1=H|last2=Laraque|first2=D|title=Lead poisoning in children.|journal=Advances in Pediatrics|date=August 2014|volume=61|issue=1|pages=313–33|pmid=25037135|doi=10.1016/j.yapd.2014.04.004 | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0065310114000164}}&lt;sup&gt;subscription required&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Bumper pads installed in [[Infant bed|crib]]s have been improved so that an infant cannot get caught between the pad and the bars of the crib.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.google.com/patents/US6564403 | title=Baby bumper pad}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Infant and toddler food safety==
{{Main|Infant food safety}}
Infant food safety is the identification of risky food handling practices and the prevention of illness in infants. The most simple and easiest to implement is handwashing.&lt;ref name = fsgov&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.foodsafety.gov/keep/types/babyfood/index.html|title=Baby Food and Infant Formula|last=Foodsafety.gov|website=www.foodsafety.gov|accessdate=26 July 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = FDA2017&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fda.gov/Food/ResourcesForYou/HealthEducators/ucm089629.htm|title=Health Educators - Food Safety for Moms to Be: Once Baby Arrives|first=Center for Food Safety and Applied|last=Nutrition|website=www.fda.gov|accessdate=25 July 2017}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt; Food for young children, including formula and [[baby food]] can contain pathogens that can make the child very ill and even die.&lt;ref name = form&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/features/cronobacter/index.html|title=Learn About Cronobacter|publisher=|accessdate=26 July 2017|date=2017-04-10}}{{PD-notice}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/43547/1/9241563311_eng.pdf?ua=1 page xv&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="FDA2017"/&gt;

==Sudden infant death syndrome (SIDS)==
{{Main | Sudden infant death syndrome}}
Sudden infant death syndrome can cause the death of an infant and often no cause is found. There are some preventative measures that can be taken to reduce the risk of SIDS. These are:

==Child abuse==
{{Main | Child abuse}}

Those who care for infants and toddlers may benefit from stress reduction. Becoming educated on normal child development can help someone understand that crying is a normal thing for babies and toddlers, especially if they hungry or need a diaper change. Caregivers can contact another person who is willing to give them a break. Those who are drinking alcohol are more likely to injure the infant or toddler. Carefully choosing someone else to watch the infant or toddler can also reduce the risk of injury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.healthychildren.org/English/safety-prevention/at-home/Pages/Abusive-Head-Trauma-Shaken-Baby-Syndrome.aspx | title=Abusive Head Trauma: How to Protect Your Baby}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Animal attacks==
{{See|Dog bite prevention}}
An infant or toddler is more likely than other family members to be injured by an animal because they cannot defend themselves and are lower to the ground. Familiar family pets with no prior history of aggression are more likely to attack the child than unfamiliar pets from other households.

==Choking==
Toddlers and infants who can hold objects can choke when a small object is inhaled and blocks the trachea.

Babywipes (diaper wipes) can be a choke hazard

The '''International Committee of Military Medicine''' ('''ICMM''') is an international and intergovernmental organization consisting of more than one hundred states. The ICMM was established in 1921, after World War I had revealed the lack of care provided to victims and the need to strengthen cooperation between the health services of the armed forces worldwide.

== History ==
[[Image:Voncken.jpg| thumb | left | General Doctor [[Jules Voncken]] ([[Belgium]]), Co-Founder and Secretary General of the International Committee of Military Medicine from 1921 until 1975]]

In 1920, after World War I had revealed the lack of cares given to the victims and the importance of the need for closer cooperation between Armed Forces Medical Services worldwide, Captain [[William S. Bainbridge]], MD ([[United States Navy|US Navy]]) and Commander Medical Officer [[Jules Voncken]] ([[Belgium]]) suggested the creation of an international organisation of the Armed Forces Medical Services at the 28th session of the US Military Medical Officers Association (AMSUS). The Belgian Government actively supported the practical development of this concept and the first International Congress of Military Medicine and Pharmacy was held in July 1921 in [[Brussels]], Belgium, in presence of HM King Albert I. It resulted in a permanent Committee of International Congresses of Military Medicine and Pharmacy (ICMPM) being officially founded on 21 July 1921 during the Congress. The founding countries were [[Belgium]], [[Brazil]], [[France]], [[Great Britain]], [[Italy]], [[Spain]], [[Switzerland]] and the [[United States]].

[[Image:Premiercongresmondialducimm.jpg| thumb | right | First International Assembly of Medical Services of the Armies, Navies and Air Forces, July 1921, [[Belgium]]]]

Since, ICMPM has always gathered, in uniform, Health Services stemmed from all political blocs, even during the worst period of the Cold War. On 21 May 1952, an agreement of cooperation was signed with the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) who recognised the Committee as an “international body specialised in medico-military matters”. On 28 April 1990, the Committee changed its name and became the '''International Committee of Military Medicine''' (ICMM). New ICMM Statutes, revised in line with modern-day policies, were voted in at the General Assembly held in Beijing, China, in 1996. ICMM signed a memorandum of understanding with [[World Health Organization]] in 2004 and the [[World Organisation for Animal Health]] (OIE) in 2006.

== Objectives of ICMM ==
'''The main objective''' of the ICMM is to ensure that our medical services personnel have the means to work together, using similar practices, in operations involving international cooperation. This is a long-term goal, and the ICMM can work towards achieving this in a number of ways: by encouraging activities at which scientific and technical experience is shared, by developing contacts with the scientific community, by promoting regional events. This will enable us to pool our resources and work experience of military medicine, both in the theatre of operations and in a support role in the case of crisis situations.

'''Other ICMM objectives''' include:
– to maintain and strengthen relations between Medical Services of Member States
– to promote scientific military medical activities
– to provide where necessary best practices and standards which Member States can aim for
– to help to develop medical and military medical recommendations for humanitarian operations – these could range from Armed Forces humanitarian interventions to peacekeeping operations
– to facilitate relations between Armed Forces Medical Services of ICMM Member States and international organizations such as [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), [[World Organisation for Animal Health]] (OIE), [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS]] (UNAIDS), [[International Military Sports Council]] (IMSC), [[World Veterinary Association]] (WVA) or [[World Medical Association]] (WMA), …

The above objectives are of interest to all sectors of military medicine in the wider sense, i.e. :
* Screening personnel,
* Medicine within military units,
* Surgery in the theatre of operations,
* Emergency medicine,
* Disaster response,
* Public health,
* Dentistry,
* Pharmacy,
* Veterinary sciences,
* Administration and medical logistics training.

== Activities ==
* Exchanges and Information Forum
* The ICMM major role is to contribute to exchanges in all the medico-military fields both technological and scientific.
* This is achieved mainly during World and Regional Congresses regrouping delegations of Member States and representatives of observer countries, but also during multilateral exchanges.
* The [http://www.icmmdelhi2017.com/ 42nd ICMM World Congress on Military Medicine] was held in New Delhi, [[India]] in November 2017.
* 43rd World Congress of the International Committee of Military Medicine (ICMM) will be held in Basel, Switzerland on May 19-24, 2019.
* Pan-Asia Pacific, Pan-American, Pan-African, Pan-European, Maghreb and Pan-Arab Regional Working Groups organize Regional Congresses and Courses.
* The [http://www.cimm-icmm.org/page/anglais/5emeCongresPanArabTunisie2018ANG/5emeCongresPanArabTunisie2018ANG.php 5th Pan-Arab Regional Working Group Congress on Military Medicine] was held during the period of May, 3-5, 2018, in Hammamet, Tunisia.
* The [http://www.cimm-icmm.org/page/anglais/11emeCongresPanAfricain2018SenegalANG/11emeCongresPanAfricain2018SenegalANG.php 11th ICMM Pan-African Regional Congress] was held on May 11-13, 2018 in Dakar, Senegal.
* The [http://icmm.wim.mil.pl/ 5th ICMM Pan-European Congress on Military Medicine] was held in Warsaw, Poland, from 17th to 20th September, 2018.
* The [http://icmmtehran2018.com/ 4th ICMM Pan-Asia Pacific Congress on Military Medicine] was held from October 12 to 15, 2018, in IRIB International Conference Center, Tehran, Iran.
* The 9th ICMM Pan-American Congress on Military Medicine was held in Vina del Mar, Chile from 13 to 17 November, 2018.
* Each quarter, the ICMM publishes its official organ, the ''''''International Review of the Armed Forces Medical Services''''''.

Scientific ICMM showcase, the ''''''International Review of the Armed Forces Medical Services'''''' is the material link between Medical Services and Member States. Several copies are sent for free to the delegates of each Member State and to other structures of the Medical Services. This link is strengthened with the ICMM official website, where all information about ICMM’s activities, structures and official working documents are updated.
* The active participation of Member States allows them to get all advantages they could expect during the different congresses and multilateral exchanges.
* The official languages for the exchanges are French and English.

== Study of Training and Coaching ==
In this field the ICMM objectives are:
* Making exchanges easier on training methods used in the world,
* Trying to make out guidelines (Not restrictive),
* Establishing a database on existing training,
* Organizing international courses.

== Assessment of disaster situations ==
The ICMM promotes discussions on the Medical Services activity during natural or technological main disasters.

== Cooperation with international organizations ==
The ICMM has signed agreements with [[World Health Organization|WHO]], [[International Committee of the Red Cross|ICRC]], [[World Organisation for Animal Health|OIE]], [[Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS|UNAIDS]], [[International Military Sports Council|CISM]], [[World Veterinary Association|WVA]] and [[World Medical Association|WMA]]. These agreements provide for cooperation with medical services of our Member States in order to detect and respond to major epidemics posing a global threat to public health. WHO, ICRC, OIE, UNAIDS, CISM, WVA and WMA contact each government individually. We are also discussing draft agreements with other international organizations.

== Study of International Humanitarian Law evolution ==
* It is clear today that current conflicts and military interventions impose an evolution of this law. Based on actual experience within the ICMM context, we can collaborate, in this aim, with specialized organizations.
* Fruitful exchanges are taking place during different meetings at the ICMM.
* A [http://www.melac.ch Course of Law of Armed Conflicts] is organized each year with the support of [[Switzerland]]. This course is actually decentralized in different regions of the world.

== Structure and Working of ICMM ==
The ICMM is a neutral and non political international intergovernmental organization.

Actually, ICMM is made up of 117 Member States and 5 observer States, all of which are either members of the United Nations (UN), have the status of official observers with in the UN or are recognised as members of [[World Health Organization|WHO]]. Each Member State is represented by an official delegate who is appointed by the government of his country. Each Member State brought a request issued from the Ministry of Defense or the Foreign Affairs or one of the State high authority, willing to be a member of ICMM and its statutes. This request is addressed to the Secretary-General and then approved during a session of the General Assembly of the Member States during the World Congress every two years. Each Member State pays one’s subscription regarding its importance (GDP, Debt level, Population). This subscription gives the State the right to vote in the General Assembly and to organize activities acknowledged by the ICMM. Only a moral duty of active participation follows the membership of Member States. General Assemblies recommendations are always non restrictive and strictly observe each Member State sovereignty principle. Only the political power of each Member State can change ICMM recommendations into decisions applicable to its own Armed Forces. In accordance with ICMM’s statutes and history, Belgium is the seat of the Secretariat General, the executive branch of ICMM. The stability of the headquarters is a condition of continuity, avoiding exaggerated costs of working. On the same way, it  is important to notice that all the responsible persons here following are unpaid and volunteer, except a few paid executive secretaries. The Secretary-General is elected by the General Assembly for a 4-years renewable mandate. He is at the head of the ICMM executive branch. The actual Secretary-General is Major General (MD) (ret.) Roger VAN HOOF, assisted by his Deputy Secretary-General, Major General (MD) Pierre NEIRINCKX and a few assistants. They represent the political body of the Secretariat General. The Secretary-General and his Deputy are Belgians, according with the statutes of ICMM. The Secretary-General executes the decisions of the General Assembly. The General Assembly holds its session every two years during the World Congresses, and is led by the Chairman of ICMM. This one is related to the Member State that organizes the World Congress. He is at the head of the ICMM legislative branch by supervising the General Assembly’s work during the World Congress in his country. His mandate, not renewable, runs for the duration between two General Assemblies. The Secretary-General reports to him his executive activities. The last World Congress was held in [[India]] in November 2017. The actual Chairman of ICMM is Lieutenant General, VSM, PHS Bipin PURI. ([[India]]). All scientific matters are controlled by the Scientific Council, directed by the Chairman of the Scientific Council, Major General Prof. Marc MORILLON, MD. He is elected by the General Assembly for a 4- years renewable mandate. He is assisted by the Deputy Chairman of the Scientific Council, Brigadier General Humbert BOISSEAUX, MD, also elected by the General Assembly for a 4- years renewable mandate. To help the Scientific Council, there are Technical Commissions in following specialities: Veterinarian, Pharmacy, Dentistry, Logistics and Education. Their Chairmen are also elected by the General Assembly for a 4-years renewable mandate.

== Challenges ==
The past years, ICMM had to face many challenges:
The need to stay in close contact with all the parts of the World, preparing between two World Congresses the matters that will be discussed in the General Assembly where the decisions are taken. The demand of organizing courses and scientific activities on regional base, and to decentralize international courses, such as the International Course on Humanitarian Law. The need to educate the basic medical personals and not only to inform the top levels of the Medical Services. The need to specialize the medical personals in specific regional situations they can meet in operation everywhere in the world. The need for the basic medical personals to share their practical and scientific experiences and to know for advance the international partners they will work with in operation. So ICMM has included in its statutes the principle of an International Working Group (IWG) and of Regional Working Groups (RWG), and created a Commission for Education. The composition of the IWG is being decided during the General Assembly and helps the Secretary-General to prepare the matters and the decisions the General Assembly will discuss and take in its next session. The Delegates of the Member States of the IWG are the link between the Secretary-General and all the Member States in the period between two World Congresses. A RWG can be created by different Member States which want to share their experiences and problems on a regional base. The RWG is accredited by the General Assembly. Actually, the Pan American Regional Working Group, the Pan African Regional Working Group, the Maghreb Regional Working Group and the Pan Arab Working Group are active and organize Regional Congresses and Courses, between two World Congresses. During the Regional Congress, there is a meeting of the Delegates of the Member States of the RWG, in order to ensure the continuity of working. But this “Regional Assembly” has no legislative power such as the “General Assembly” of ICMM. The Secretary-General stays in close contact with the Chairman of the RWG and the Chairman of the Scientific Council can help for all scientific aspects of the Regional Congress. The Technical Commission for Education depends on the Chairman of the Scientific Council, and helps him to ensure the quality of the courses that can be decentralized in the zone of the RWG. The Chairman of the Scientific Council is also in contact with the Coordinators who organize the Courses, and the Secretary-General is in touch with the Directors of International Courses, who are generally Heads of Armed Forces Medical Services of Member States organizing an international course in their country. The good working of the IWG, the RWG and the Courses are big challenges for ICMM in the next years. The working of World and Regional Congresses and Courses are regulated by official documents as Regulations of Internal Order (RIO), which are voted by the General Assembly, and by Practical Guides. All those documents can be found on the website of ICMM.

The 43rd ICMM World Congress on Military Medicine will be hosted by [[Switzerland]], in [[Basel]], in May 2019.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2976">In [[hospital]]s and other medical facilities, an '''isolation ward''' is a separate ward used to [[Isolation (health care)|isolate]] patients suffering from [[infection|infectious]] diseases.  Several wards for individual patients are usually placed together in an '''isolation unit'''.

==Design==
[[File:Ebola outbreak in Gulu Municipal Hospital.jpg|thumb|right|The isolation ward of Gulu Municipal Hospital, Gulu, Uganda, during an outbreak of [[Ebola]] hemorrhagic fever in October 2000]]
In an isolation unit, several measures must be implemented in order to reduce the spread of infection.  The units are generally placed away from the main hospital, and staff often only work in that unit.  In some hospitals, the unit is placed in a separate building.  Ventilation is important to reduce the transmission of airborne spores, and the most severely affected patients are placed in separate wards.&lt;ref&gt;Lt Col SKM Rao. 2004 ''Medical Journal Armed Forces India'' [http://medind.nic.in/maa/t04/i1/maat04i1p63.pdf "Designing Hospital for better Infection Control:an Experience"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BMJ 1978"&gt;K D Bagshawe; R Blowers; O M Lidwell (1978)[https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC1607595/pdf/brmedj00143-0034.pdf "Isolating patients in hospital to control infection. Part III--Design and construction of isolation accommodation."] ''British Medical Journal''&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in some circumstances, especially in areas experiencing a major epidemic, makeshift isolation wards can be constructed.&lt;ref name="Uganda"/&gt;

==Use==
Isolation wards are used to isolate patients who pose a risk of passing a potentially harmful infection on to others.  Such infections can range in severity widely, from diseases such as [[influenza]] to [[ebola]], although more precautions are generally taken with diseases of a higher mortality rate.
Outside major hospitals, isolation wards can be set up to control infection in crowded places, or those lacking substantial medical facilities.&lt;ref name="Uganda"&gt;''Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene'' 2009 [http://fieldresearch.msf.org/msf/bitstream/10144/90161/1/Raabe%20-%20Infection%20control%20FHF%20outbreak.pdf Infection control during filoviral hemorrhagic fever outbreaks: preferences of community members and health workers in Masindi, Uganda]&lt;/ref&gt;  Many major passenger ships contain separate wards which can be converted for use in isolating patients.&lt;ref&gt;[[World Health Organization]] [http://www.who.int/csr/sars/travel/vessels/en/ Recommended procedures for prevention and management of probable cases of SARS on International Cruise Vessels] 4 June 2003&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Marjo Hallowell 2009[http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/1298071?UserKey= Cruise is over at first port as hundreds fall prey to illness]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3223">'''Kevin's Law''' (as referred to in Representative [[Anna Eshoo]]'s introduction of the law in 2005 and in the 2008 documentary ''[[Food, Inc.]]''; formally known as the Meat and Poultry Pathogen Reduction and Enforcement Act of 2003) was proposed legislation that would have given the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] the power to close down plants that produce contaminated meat.&lt;ref name="Kevins Story"&gt;[http://www.foodborneillness.org/leadership/140-kevins-story.html Kevin's Story], foodborneillness.org page for Kevin's Story&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Kevin's Law was nicknamed in memory of two-year-old Kevin Kowalcyk of Colorado, who died in 2001 after developing [[hemolytic-uremic syndrome]] due to eating a hamburger contaminated with [[Escherichia coli_O157:H7|''E. coli'' O157:H7]]. 

The bill was introduced by Rep. Anna G. Eshoo, D-Palo Alto, as H.R. 3160, in the 109th Congress.&lt;ref name="H.R.3160 - Kevin's Law"&gt;[http://www.opencongress.org/bill/109-h3160/show H.R.3160 - Kevin's Law], Open Congress page for H.R.3160 - Kevin's Law&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Anna G. Eshoo"&gt;[http://eshoo.house.gov/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=104 Anna G. Eshoo, D-Palo Alto], house.gov page for Kevin's Law&lt;/ref&gt;  This bill never became law, as it was referred to committee but never reported on.

In 2011, President [[Barack Obama]] signed into law the [[FDA Food Safety Modernization Act]] (FSMA), introduced by Rep. [[Betty Sutton]]. The FSMA contains key elements of Kevin's Law.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/barbara-kowalcyk/food-safety-bill-history_b_805283.html|title = Food Safety Law Makes History|work = Huff Post Food|publisher = [[Huffington Post]]|accessdate = March 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kevin's Law would strengthen the U.S. government's ability to prevent contaminated meat and poultry from entering the food supply by:

*Requiring the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] (USDA) to identify the pathogens that threaten human health (e.g., ''[[Salmonella]]'', ''E. coli'' O157:H7, ''[[Listeria monocytogenes]]''). 
*Requiring the USDA to establish performance standards to reduce the presence of these pathogens in meat and poultry. 
*Confirming that the USDA has the authority to enforce its own standards by shutting down plants that continually breach basic health standards.  Courts have held that the USDA does not  have this authority in the absence of explicit authorizing legislation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4643">'''Lee Everett''' or '''Lee Everett Alkin''' (born '''Audrey Valentine Middleton'''; February 14, 1937) is a British [[spiritual healer]] and businesswoman who was previously a [[pop singer]] and celebrity [[psychic]] under the stage name '''Lady Lee'''.

Born in [[Sheffield]], Audrey Middleton moved to London in 1958 after the breakdown of her first marriage. She was a [[backing singer]] for [[Emile Ford]] before [[Larry Parnes]] became her manager and gave her the stage name "Lady Lee". She also attracted media attention as the girlfriend of [[Billy Fury]], one of Parnes's best known artists. In 1964 she got a recording contract and released three [[single (music)|single]]s, none a hit: a cover of "[[I'm into Something Good]]", recorded around the same time by [[Herman's Hermits]]; "Ninety-Nine Times Out of a Hundred" by [[Ivor Raymonde]], released in May 1965; and "My Whole World (Seems to be Tumbling Down)" by [[Tony Macaulay]] and [[The Viscounts (British band)|Don Paul]], released in October 1965.

In 1967 she split up with Fury. In 1969 she married disc jockey [[Kenny Everett]]; they separated in 1979 and divorced in 1984. He wrote the [[foreword]] to her autobiography, published in 1987, but later criticised it for [[outing]] him; the two remained estranged until his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/news/2012-10-03/kenny-everett-by-the-women-in-his-life/|title=Kenny Everett - by the Women in His Life|date=3 October 2012|work=[[Radio Times]]|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Katherine Kelly (actress)|Katherine Kelly]] played Lee in ''The Best Possible Taste'', a BBC drama about Kenny Everett shown in 2012 .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00xzvlw|title=BBC Four - Best Possible Taste: The Kenny Everett Story|work=[[BBC Online]]|accessdate=14 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lee Everett was a friend of [[Dusty Springfield]], [[Elton John]], and [[Billie Jean King]];&lt;ref name="ValentineWickham2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Valentine|first1=Penny|last2=Wickham|first2=Vicki|title=Dancing with Demons: The Authorized Biography of Dusty Springfield |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uFSQobLF-m4C|accessdate=14 September 2017|date=2012-10-25|publisher=Hodder &amp; Stoughton|isbn=9781444719024}}&lt;/ref&gt; the latter two were among those she questioned about supposed [[past lives]] for a book she published in 1996.

In 1980 the actor [[John Alkin]] began collaborating with Lee Everett and in 1982 they opened the "House of Spirit", a "healing centre" in [[Bayswater]], London. They married in 1985, moved to Berkshire in 1994, and opened the "Obsidian College", another "healing centre", in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.obsidiancollege.com/|title=Obsidian College, Healing and Integrated Medicine|publisher=Obsidian College|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also started the "Chilliqueen" condiments company,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chilefoundry.com/2012/12/12/chilli-queen-mint-chilli-jelly/|title=Chilli Queen – Mint Chilli Jelly|last=Whitehouse|first=Chris|date=12 December 2012|work=The Chile Foundry|accessdate=13 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; which wound down when Everett turned 80 in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chilliqueen.co.uk/|title=Chilliqueen Chilli Jelly - chilli jellies |quote= The Chilliqueen has turned 80, so retirement beckons!

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="99319">This is a list of [[alternative cancer treatments|alternative treatments]] that have been promoted to treat or prevent cancer in humans but which lack scientific and medical evidence of effectiveness.  In many cases, there is scientific evidence that the alleged treatments are not effective. Unlike [[management of cancer|accepted cancer treatments]], treatments lacking in evidence of efficacy are generally ignored or avoided by the [[medicine|medical community]] and are often [[pseudoscientific]].&lt;ref name=pseudoscientific&gt;{{cite journal |author=Green S |title=Pseudoscience in Alternative Medicine: Chelation Therapy, Antineoplastons, The Gerson Diet and Coffee Enemas |journal=Skeptical Inquirer |volume=21 |issue=5 |year=1997 |page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternative health systems ==

[[File:Rhustox.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Homeopathic remedies&amp;nbsp;– ineffective for treating cancer|alt=Homeopathic medicine bottle and box, marked 'RHUS TOX']]
* [[Aromatherapy]]&amp;nbsp;– the use of fragrant substances, such as [[essential oils]], in the belief that smelling them will positively affect health. There is some evidence that aromatherapy improves general well-being, but it has also been promoted for its ability to fight diseases, including cancer. The [[American Cancer Society]] states "available scientific evidence does not support claims that aromatherapy is effective in preventing or treating cancer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* German New Medicine&amp;nbsp;– a popular medical system devised by [[Ryke Geerd Hamer]] (1935–2017), in which all disease is seen as deriving from emotional shock and mainstream medicine is regarded as a [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy]] promulgated by [[Jews]]. There is no evidence to support its claims and no biological reason why it should work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=22957409|year=2012|last1=Cassileth|first1=BR|last2=Yarett|first2=IR|title=Cancer quackery: The persistent popularity of useless, irrational 'alternative' treatments|volume=26|issue=8|pages=754–58|journal=Oncology (Williston Park, N.Y.)}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Greek cancer cure]]&amp;nbsp;– A putative cancer cure invented and promoted by [[microbiologist]] Hariton-Tzannis Alivizatos. It consisted of intravenous injections of a fluid for which Aliviatos would not reveal the formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/greek.html|title=Alivazatos Greek Cancer Cure|website=www.quackwatch.org|accessdate=6 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[American Cancer Society]] concluded that "there is no evidence that any aspect of the diagnostic test nor the treatment... are effective in the treatment of cancer."  In addition they state "Nor is there any evidence that.. the intravenous injections are safe."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Unproven methods of cancer management: Greek cancer cure|journal=[[CA (journal)|CA: A Cancer Journal for Clinicians]]|date=1990|volume=40|issue=6|pages=368–371|doi=10.3322/canjclin.40.6.368}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Herbalism]]&amp;nbsp;– a whole-body approach to promoting health, in which substances are derived from entire plants so as not to disturb what herbalists believe is the delicate chemistry of the plant as a whole.&lt;ref name="cruk-herbs"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Cancer Research UK, "there is currently no strong evidence from studies in people that herbal remedies can treat, prevent or cure cancer".&lt;ref name="cruk-herbs" /&gt;
* [[Holistic medicine]]&amp;nbsp;– a general term for an approach to medicine which encompasses mental and spiritual aspects, and which is manifested in sundry complementary and alternative methods. According to the American Cancer Society, "available scientific evidence does not support claims that these complementary and alternative methods, when used without mainstream or conventional medicine, are effective in treating cancer or any other disease".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|accessdate=19 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Homeopathy]]&amp;nbsp;– a pseudoscientific system of medicine based on ultra-diluted substances. Some proponents promote homeopathy as a cancer cure; however, according to the American Cancer Society "there is no reliable evidence showing that homeopathic remedies can treat cancer in humans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* [[Native American healing]]&amp;nbsp;– [[shamanistic]] forms of medicine traditionally practiced by some indigenous American peoples and which have been claimed as being capable of curing human diseases, including cancer.&lt;ref name=acs-nam/&gt; The American Cancer Society say that while its supportive, community aspects might improve general well-being, "available scientific evidence does not support claims that Native American healing can cure cancer or any other disease".&lt;ref name=acs-nam&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/mindbodyandspirit/native-american-healing|title=Native American healing|date=November 2008|publisher=[[American Cancer Society]]|accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Naturopathy]]&amp;nbsp;– a system of alternative medicine based on a belief in energy forces in the body and an avoidance of conventional medicine; it is promoted as a treatment for cancer and other ailments. According to the American Cancer Society, "scientific evidence does not support claims that naturopathic medicine can cure cancer or any other disease".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Naturopathic Medicine |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |date=November 2008 |url=http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/ComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine/MindBodyandSpirit/naturopathic-medicine |accessdate= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150403092521/http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/mindbodyandspirit/naturopathic-medicine |archivedate=2015-04-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Diet-based ==

[[File:Johanna Budwig.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Johanna Budwig]], 1993, inventor of a [[flaxseed]]-based diet|alt=photo portrait of Johanna Budwig, an elderly lady with gray hair and a floral dress]]
* [[Alkaline diet]]&amp;nbsp;– a restrictive diet of non-acid foods, such as that proposed by [[Edgar Cayce]] (1877–1945),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Aletheia|first1=T.R.|title=Cancer : an American con$piracy|date=2010|isbn=9781936400553|page=43|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pBr9KDr8cOwC&amp;pg=PA43&amp;dq=edgar+cayce|quote=In the long run, the best diet to follow is one that promotes an alkaline pH using the 80/20 rule. The diet that best epitomizes this rule is the Edgar Cayce diet.}}&lt;/ref&gt; based on the claim this will affect the [[pH]] of the body generally, so reducing the risk of heart disease and cancer. According to the [[Canadian Cancer Society]], "there is no evidence to support any of these claims."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.ca/en/prevention-and-screening/reduce-cancer-risk/make-informed-decisions/myths-and-controversies/alkaline-diet/|title=An alkaline diet and cancer|publisher=[[Canadian Cancer Society]]|accessdate=2018-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Breuss diet]]&amp;nbsp;– a diet based on vegetable juice and tea devised by [[Rudolf Breuss]] (1899–1990), who claimed it could cure cancer. Physicians have said that, in common with other "cancer diets", there is no evidence of effectiveness and some risk of harm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=23152069|year=2012|last1=Hübner|first1=J|last2=Marienfeld|first2=S|last3=Abbenhardt|first3=C|last4=Ulrich|first4=CM|last5=Löser|first5=C|title=How useful are diets against cancer?|volume=137|issue=47|pages=2417–22|doi=10.1055/s-0032-1327276|journal=Deutsche Medizinische Wochenschrift
}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Budwig protocol]] (or Budwig diet)&amp;nbsp;– an "anti-cancer" diet developed in the 1950s by [[Johanna Budwig]] (1908–2003). The diet is rich in [[flaxseed oil]] mixed with cottage cheese, and emphasizes meals high in fruit, vegetables, and fiber; it avoids sugar, animal fats, salad oil, meats, butter, and especially margarine. Cancer Research UK say, "there is no reliable evidence to show that the Budwig diet [...] helps people with cancer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = What is the Budwig diet?| publisher = [[Cancer Research UK]]| url = http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/about-cancer/cancer-questions/what-is-the-budwig-diet| accessdate =| date = 2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Fasting]]&amp;nbsp;– not eating or drinking for a period&amp;nbsp;– a practice which has been claimed by some alternative medicine practitioners to help fight cancer, perhaps by "starving" tumors. However, according to the American Cancer Society, "available scientific evidence does not support claims that fasting is effective for preventing or treating cancer in humans".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |title=American Cancer Society Complete Guide to Complementary and Alternative Cancer Therapies |edition=2nd |year=2009 |isbn=9780944235713 |editors=Russell J, Rovere A |chapter=Fasting}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Hallelujah diet&amp;nbsp;– a restrictive "biblical" diet based on raw food, claimed by its inventor to have cured his cancer. [[Stephen Barrett]] has written on Quackwatch: "Although low-fat, high-fiber diets can be healthful, the Hallelujah Diet is unbalanced and can lead to serious deficiencies."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Rev. George M. Malkmus and his Hallelujah Diet|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/malkmus.html|date=29 May 2003|accessdate=|author=Stephen Barrett, M.D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Kousmine diet&amp;nbsp;– a restrictive diet devised by [[Catherine Kousmine]] (1904–1992) which emphasized fruit, vegetables, grains, pulses and the use of vitamin supplements. There is no evidence that the diet is an effective cancer treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Jean-Marie Abgrall|title=Healing Or Stealing?: Medical Charlatans in the New Age|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kel6_1aN5JwC&amp;pg=PA83|date=1 January 2000|publisher=Algora Publishing|isbn=978-1-892941-28-2|pages=82–83}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Macrobiotic diet]]&amp;nbsp;– a restrictive diet based on grains and unrefined foods, and promoted by some as a preventative and cure for cancer.&lt;ref name="isbn0-89529-486-9"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Esko, Edward |author2=Kushi, Michio |title=The macrobiotic approach to cancer: towards preventing and controlling cancer with diet and lifestyle |publisher=Avery Pub. Group |location=Wayne, N.J |year=1991 |isbn=978-0-89529-486-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cancer Research UK states "we don't support the use of macrobiotic diets for people with cancer".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

* [[Moerman Therapy]]&amp;nbsp;– a highly restrictive diet devised by Cornelis Moerman (1893–1988). Its effectiveness is supported by anecdote only&amp;nbsp;– there is no evidence of its worth as a cancer treatment.&lt;ref name="qw-moerman"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Cancer/moerman.html|author=Stephen Barrett, M.D.|date=11 December 2001|accessdate=|title=The Moerman Diet|publisher=[[Quackwatch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Superfood]]&amp;nbsp;– a marketing term applied to certain foods with supposed health-giving properties. Cancer Research UK note that superfoods are often promoted as having an ability to prevent or cure diseases, including cancer; they caution, "you shouldn't rely on so-called 'superfoods' to reduce the risk of cancer. They cannot substitute for a generally healthy and balanced diet".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title='Superfoods' and cancer|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-info/healthyliving/cancercontroversies/superfoods/|publisher=[[Cancer Research UK]]|accessdate=|date=2015-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Electromagnetic and energy-based ==

[[File:Orgone Energy Accumulator (right-angle, open).JPG|left|thumb|upright|An orgone accumulator&amp;nbsp;– a subject sitting in one is meant to experience the effects of [[orgone]], an energy force proposed by [[Wilhelm Reich]]]]
* [[Bioresonance therapy]]&amp;nbsp;– diagnosis and therapy delivered by attaching an electrical device to the patient, on the basis that cancer cells emit certain electromagnetic oscillations. The [[Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center]] says that such claims are not supported by any evidence and note that the US [[Food and Drug Administration]] has prosecuted many sellers of such devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.mskcc.org/cancer-care/herb/bioresonance-therapy|title=BioResonance Therapy|publisher=[[Memorial Sloan-Kettering Cancer Center]]|accessdate=|date=29 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Electrohomeopathy]] (or Mattei cancer cure)&amp;nbsp;– a treatment devised by Count Cesare Mattei (1809–1896), who proposed that different "colors" of electricity could be used to treat cancer. Popular in the late nineteenth century, electrohomeopathy has been described as "utter idiocy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmc=1692368|year=1906|last1=Kempf|first1=EJ|title=European Medicine: A Résumé of Medical Progress During the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries|volume=3|issue=4|pages=231–48|journal=Journal of the Medical Library Association|quote=The electrohomeopathic system is an invention of Count Mattei who prates of 'red,' 'blue,' and 'green' electricity, a theory that, in spite of its utter idiocy, has attracted a considerable following and earned a large fortune for its chief promoter.|pmid=18340885}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Electro Physiological Feedback Xrroid]]&amp;nbsp;– an electronic device promoted as being capable of diagnosing and treating cancer and a host of other ailments. However, according to Quackwatch: "The Quantum Xrroid device is claimed to balance 'bio-energetic' forces that the scientific community does not recognize as real. It mainly reflects skin resistance (how easily low-voltage electric currents from the device pass through the skin), which is not related to the body's health."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/01QuackeryRelatedTopics/Tests/xrroid.html|first=Stephen | last = Barrett | authorlink = Stephen Barrett|title=Some Notes on the Quantum Xrroid (QXCI) and William C. Nelson|accessdate=|date=July 2009|publisher=[[Quackwatch]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Light therapy]]&amp;nbsp;– the use of light to treat medical conditions. According to the American Cancer Society, alternative approaches&amp;nbsp;– such as [[chromotherapy]] or the use of [[Light therapy#Light boxes|light boxes]]&amp;nbsp;– have not been shown to be effective for cancer treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/Treatment/TreatmentsandSideEffects/ComplementaryandAlternativeMedicine/HerbsVitaminsandMinerals/light-therapy|title=Light Therapy|date=14 April 2011|publisher=[[American Cancer Society]]|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Magnetic therapy]]&amp;nbsp;– the practice of placing magnets on and around the body in order to treat illness. Although this has been promoted as a treatment for cancer and other diseases, the American Cancer Society says, "available scientific evidence does not support these claims".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|publisher=[[American Cancer Society]]|url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/herbsvitaminsandminerals/magnetic-therapy|title=Magnetic Therapy|date=December 2012|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Orgone]]&amp;nbsp;– a type of life force proposed to exist by [[Wilhelm Reich]] (1897–1957) which he claimed could be harnessed to cure diseases, including cancer, perhaps by sitting inside an "orgone accumulator"&amp;nbsp;– a cupboard-like box with metal and organic linings. Quackwatch comments that scientists investigating Reich's ideas have been "unable to find the slightest evidence in Reich's data or elsewhere that such a thing as orgone exists".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Some Notes on Wilhelm Reich, M.D|author=Stephen Barrett, M.D.|publisher=[[Quackwatch]]|url=http://www.quackwatch.org/11Ind/reich.html|date=15 February 2002|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Polarity therapy]]&amp;nbsp;– a type of [[energy medicine]] based on the idea that the positive or negative charge of a person's electromagnetic field affects their health. Although it is promoted as effective for curing a number of human ailments, including cancer, the American Cancer Society says "available scientific evidence does not support claims that polarity therapy is effective in treating cancer or any other disease".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher=[[American Cancer Society]] |title=American Cancer Society Complete Guide to Complementary and Alternative Cancer Therapies |edition=2nd |year=2009 |isbn=9780944235713 |editors=Russell J, Rovere A |pages=235–37 |chapter=Polarity Therapy}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Royal Rife|Rife Frequency Generator]]&amp;nbsp;– an electronic device purported to cure cancer by transmitting radio waves. Cancer Research UK state, "there is no evidence to show that the Rife machine does what its supporters say it does".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancerresearchuk.org/cancer-help/about-cancer/cancer-questions/rife-machine-and-cancer|title=Rife machines and cancer|publisher=[[Cancer Research UK]]|accessdate=|date=2017-08-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Therapeutic Touch]] (or TT)&amp;nbsp;– contrary to its name, a technique that does not usually involve touching; rather, a practitioner holds their hands close to a patient to affect the "energy" in their body. According to the American Cancer Society, "available scientific evidence does not support any claims that TT can cure cancer or other diseases".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cancer.org/treatment/treatmentsandsideeffects/complementaryandalternativemedicine/manualhealingandphysicaltouch/therapeutic-touch|title=Therapeutic Touch|date=April 2011|publisher=[[American Cancer Society]]|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Macdonald triad''' (also known as the ''triad of [[sociopathy]]'' or the ''[[homicide|homicidal]] triad'') is a set of three factors that has been suggested (Macdonald 1963), if all three or any combination of two, are present together, to be predictive of or associated with later [[violent tendencies]], particularly with relation to [[serial offender|serial offenses]]. The triad was first proposed by [[psychiatrist]] [[J.M. Macdonald]] in "The Threat to Kill", a 1963 paper in the ''[[American Journal of Psychiatry]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Macdonald |first1=John M. |date=August 1963 |title=The threat to kill |journal=Am J Psychiatry |doi=10.1176/ajp.120.2.125 |volume=120 |issue=2 |pages=125–130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Small-scale studies conducted by psychiatrists Daniel Hellman and Nathan Blackman, and then FBI agents [[John E. Douglas]] and [[Robert K. Ressler]] along with Dr. [[Ann Burgess]], claimed substantial evidence for the association of these childhood patterns with later [[Criminal predatory behaviour|predatory behavior]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ressler |first1=Robert K. |last2=Burgess |first2=Ann W. |last3=Douglas |first3=John E. |date=1988 |title=Sexual Homicide Patterns and Motives |publisher=Simon and Schuster |location=New York, NY |isbn=9780669165593}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although it remains an influential and widely taught theory, subsequent research has generally not validated this line of thinking.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.uk.sagepub.com/books/Book234764/ Criminal &amp; Behavioral Profiling] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131029193008/http://www.uk.sagepub.com/books/Book234764/ |date=2013-10-29 }} Curt R.

The triad links [[cruelty to animals]], [[Pyromania|obsession with fire-setting]], and persistent [[Nocturnal enuresis|bedwetting]] past a certain age, to violent behaviors, particularly homicidal behavior and sexually predatory behavior.&lt;ref name="singer"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Singer |first1=Stephen D. |last2=Hensley |first2=Christopher |date=2004 |title=Learning theory to childhood and adolescent firesetting: Can it lead to serial murder? |journal=International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology |doi=10.1177/0306624X04265087 |pmid=15245657 |volume=48 |issue=4 |pages=461–476}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, other studies claim to have not found statistically significant links between the triad and violent offenders&lt;sup&gt;need cite&lt;/sup&gt;.

Further studies have suggested that these behaviors are actually more linked to childhood experience of parental neglect, brutality or abuse. Some argue ''this'' in turn results in "homicidal proneness".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Dicanio |first=Margaret |date=2004 |title=Encyclopedia of Violence |publisher=iUniverse |isbn=0-595-31652-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "triad" concept as a particular combination of behaviors linked to violence may not have any particular validity – it has been called an [[urban legend]].&lt;ref&gt;Skrapec, C. and Ryan, K., 2010-11-16 "[http://www.allacademic.com/meta/p431806_index.html The Macdonald Triad: Persistence of an Urban Legend]" Paper presented at the annual meeting of the ASC Annual Meeting, San Francisco Marriott, San Francisco, California&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arson==
In Singer and Hensley (2004), arson, or fire-setting, is theorized to be a less severe or first shot at releasing aggression.  Extensive periods of humiliation have been found to be present in the childhoods of several adult serial killers.  These repetitive episodes of humiliation can lead to feelings of frustration and anger, which need to somehow be released in order to return to a normal state of self-worth.&lt;ref name="singer"/&gt; However, the triad combination has been questioned in this regard also, and a review has suggested that this behavior is just one that can occur in the context of childhood antisocial behavior and isn't necessarily predictive of later violence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aic.gov.au/en/publications/current%20series/bfab/21-40/bfab036.aspx Firesetting as a predictor of violence] Bushfire arson bulletin no. 36 ISSN 1832-2743 Canberra: Australian Institute of Criminology, September 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cruelty to animals==
[[Federal Bureau of Investigation|FBI Special Agent]] Alan Brantly believed that some offenders kill animals as a rehearsal for killing human victims.&lt;ref&gt;Barnard, N.D &amp; Hogan, A.R. (1999 June 6). Moving up the chain of abuse pattern shows cruelty to animals is one predictor of violent behavior in adults. Seattle Post-Intelligencer, p. C.1.&lt;/ref&gt; Cruelty to animals is mainly used to vent frustration and anger the same way firesetting is.  Extensive amounts of humiliation were also found in the childhoods of children who engaged in acts of cruelty to animals.  During childhood, serial killers could not retaliate towards those who caused them humiliation, so they chose animals because they were viewed as weak and vulnerable.  Future victim selection is already in the process at a young age.  Studies have found that those who engaged in childhood acts of cruelty to animals used the same method of killing on their human victims as they did on their animal victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=J. |last2=Hensley |first2=C. |date=2003 |title=From animal cruelty to serial murder: Applying the graduation hypothesis |journal=International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology |doi=10.1177/0306624X02239276 |pmid=12613433 |volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=71–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wright and Hensley (2003) named three recurring themes in their study of five cases of serial murderers: As children, they vented their frustrations because the person causing them anger or humiliation was too powerful to take down; they felt as if they regained some control and power over their lives through the torture and killing of the animals; they gained the power and control they needed to cause pain and suffering of a weaker, more vulnerable animal – escalating to humans in the future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Wright |first1=Jeremy |last2=Hensley |first2=Christopher |date=1 February 2003 |title=From Animal Cruelty to Serial Murder: Applying the Graduation Hypothesis |journal=International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology  |doi=10.1177/0306624X02239276 |pmid=12613433|volume=47 |issue=1 |pages=71–88}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study of 45 male prison inmates who were deemed violent offenders, McClellan (2003) found that 56% admitted to having committed acts of violence against animals.  It was also found that children who abused animals were more often the victims of parental abuse than children who did not abuse animals.&lt;ref&gt;McClellan, J. (2007). Animal cruelty and violent behavior: Is there a connection? Journal of Security Education. 2.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 2004 study, which considered not one-off events but patterns of repeat violence, Tallichet and Hensley found a link between repeated animal cruelty and violence against humans. They examined prisoners in maximum or medium security prisons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tallichet |first1=S. E. |last2=Hensley |first2=C. |date=1 September 2004 |title=Exploring the Link between Recurrent Acts of Childhood and Adolescent Animal Cruelty and Subsequent Violent Crime |journal=Criminal Justice Review |doi=10.1177/073401680402900203 |volume=29 |issue=2 |pages=304–316}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, over-generalizing possible links between animal violence and human violence can have unwanted consequences such as detracting focus from other possible predictors or causes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Patterson-Kane |first1=Emily G. |last2=Piper |first2=Heather |date=1 September 2009 |title=Animal Abuse as a Sentinel for Human Violence: A Critique |journal=Journal of Social Issues |doi=10.1111/j.1540-4560.2009.01615.x |volume=65 |issue=3 |pages=589–614}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Enuresis==
[[Enuresis]] is "unintentional bed-wetting during sleep, persistent after the age of five".&lt;ref&gt;''Serial Murderers and Their Victims''. (E W Hickey). Belmont, CA: Wadsworth Cengage Learning (2009) (page 101).&lt;/ref&gt; The bed-wetting must continue twice a week for at least three consecutive months.

Some authors{{Who?|date=January 2018}} continue to speculate that enuresis may be related to firesetting and animal cruelty in some way. One argument is that because persistent bed-wetting beyond the age of five can be humiliating for a child, especially if he or she is belittled by a parental figure or other adult as a result, this could cause the child to use firesetting or cruelty to animals as an outlet for their  frustration.&lt;ref name="singer"/&gt; Enuresis is an "unconscious, involuntary, and nonviolent act and therefore linking it to violent crime is more problematic than doing so with animal cruelty or firesetting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Hickey |first=Eric |date=2010 |title=Serial Murderers and their Victims |publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning |location=Belmont, CA |isbn=978-4-9560081-4-3 |page=101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Douglas and his fellow researchers however, the triad behaviors are not causal when examining a relationship with later predatory behavior, but rather, are predictive of an increased likelihood of future behavior patterns, and give professionals a chance to halt some patterns before they progress.

'''Masinga Hydroelectric Power Station''', also '''Masinga Dam''', is an [[embankment dam]] on the [[Tana River (Kenya)|Tana River]], the longest [[river]] in [[Kenya]]. It straddles the border of [[Embu County|Embu]] and [[Machakos County|Machakos Counties]] in [[Eastern Province (Kenya)|Eastern Province]] and is located about 106 km. (66 mi.), by road, northeast of [[Nairobi]], Kenya's capital and largest city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://distancecalculator.globefeed.com/Kenya_Distance_Result.asp?fromplace=Nairobi%20Central%2C%20Nairobi%2C%20Kenya&amp;toplace=Masinga%20Dam%2C%20Kenya&amp;dt1=ChIJNe4z_9QQLxgRVVtoNpaFdCw&amp;dt2=ChIJAXMp3S0DJhgRMhlCuEQM8Nc |title=Distance between Nairobi Central, Nairobi, Kenya and Masinga Dam, Kenya |date=19 February 2018 | access-date=19 February 2018 |publisher=Globefeed.com | author=Globefeed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Construction of the dam began in 1978.&lt;ref name="sa"/&gt; The dam was completed in 1981.&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt; It is owned by ''Tana and Athi Rivers Development Authority'' (TARDA).&lt;ref name="bd"/&gt; The dam is used for power production and is part of the [[Hydroelectric power in Kenya#Seven Forks Scheme|Seven Forks Scheme]].&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt;

==Dam==
Masinga Dam is a 60 m tall and 2,200 m long embankment dam.&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt; The volume of the dam is 4,950,000 m³. The dam contains a [[spillway]] and a bottom outlet.&lt;ref name="sa"/&gt;

==Reservoir==
At full reservoir level (maximum flood level of 1,056.5 m)&lt;ref name="bd"/&gt; the reservoir of the dam has a surface area of 120&amp;nbsp;km² and its total capacity is 1,56 million m³.&lt;ref name="sa"/&gt; Minimum operating level is normally 1,037 m. On June 26, KenGen shut down the power plant because the operating level had fallen to 1,035.5 m. At the time of the closure the plant had been producing 14 [[Megawatt|MW]].&lt;ref name="bt"/&gt;

Because of its large volume, the reservoir is crucial in regulating the flow of water for the other 4 [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power plants downstream.&lt;ref name="ke"/&gt;

==Power plant==
The [[Run-of-the-river hydroelectricity|run-of-the-river]] [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power plant went operational in 1981. It is owned by TARDA, but operated by [[Kenya Electricity Generating Company]] (KenGen).&lt;ref name="bd"/&gt; The plant has a [[nameplate capacity]] of 40 [[Megawatt|MW]]. Its average annual generation is between 128 (in 2008) and 232 (in 2007) [[GWh]],&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt; depending on the water flow of the Tana River.

The power plant contains 2 [[Kaplan turbine]]-generators with 20 MW each. The turbines were provided by [[Escher Wyss &amp; Cie.|Escher Wyss]], the generators by [[ABB Group|ABB]]. The maximum [[hydraulic head]] is 49 m, maximum flow per turbine is 45.9 (45)&lt;ref name="sa"/&gt; m³/s.&lt;ref name="geo"/&gt;

==History==
Capital cost of the dam was USD172 million.{{fact|date=February 2018}}

Feasibility studies were made in the 1970s and they confirmed the viability of a cascade of hydroelectric power plants along the [[Tana River (Kenya)|Tana River]]: Masinga, Kamburu, Gitaru, Kindaruma, Kiambere, Karura, Mutonga, Low Grand Falls, Usheni, Adamsons Falls, and Kora. Only the first five of them have been built so far.&lt;ref name="ke"/&gt;

Plans to raise the dam by 1.5 m in order to increase the volume of the reservoir up to 2 billion m³ were finally cancelled. The cost would have been USD15 million.&lt;ref name="bd"/&gt;

In February 2018, KenGen resurrected plans to raise the Masinga Dam wall by {{convert|2|m|ft}}, and install pumping equipment to recycle the downstream water discharge back to the dam for steady electricity output though the dry seasons. The [[French Development Agency]] (AFD) agreed to lend the KSh21 million (€169,000) required to conduct a fresh feasibility and environment impact assessment. AFD selected [[EDF Group]], a [[France|French]] company to carry out the study.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.businessdailyafrica.com/news/KenGen-signs-fresh-deal-to-upgrade-Masinga-dam-wall/539546-4310038-pu1tjoz/index.html |title=KenGen signs fresh deal to upgrade Masinga dam wall |access-date=19 February 2018 |first=Neville | last=Otuki |date=19 February 2018 |newspaper=[[Business Daily Africa]] |location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heavy rains beginning in March 2018 led to major flooding throughout the Tana River area. On 17 May 2018, it was announced that the Masinga dam had reached capacity and had begun to overflow one week after the deadly [[Patel Dam failure|failure of a smaller embankment dam]] in [[Solai]]. While safeguards in place prevented the dam from failing, other dams downstream had already reached capacity and authorities advised the evacuation of the towns of [[Garissa]], [[Garsen]], [[Hola, Kenya|Hola]], and [[Bura, Tana River County|Bura]].&lt;ref name="Standard Overflow"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Okuoro|first1=Sara|title=Masinga Dam overflows|url=https://www.standardmedia.co.ke/article/2001280779/masinga-dam-overflows|accessdate=18 May 2018|publisher=[[The Standard (Kenya)|The Standard]]|date=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''[[Master's|Master of Science]] in [[Nursing]]''' ('''MSN''') is an advanced-level [[postgraduate degree]] for [[registered nurse]]s and is considered an entry-level degree for [[nurse educator]]s and [[Nursing management|managers]]. The degree also may prepare a nurse to seek a career as a nurse administrator, health policy expert, or [[clinical nurse leader]]. The MSN may be used as a prerequisite for [[doctorate]]-level nursing education, and used to be required to become an [[advanced practice registered nurse]] such as a [[nurse practitioner]], [[clinical nurse specialist]], [[nurse anesthetist]], or [[nurse midwife]].

This graduate-level degree may focus on one or more of many different advanced [[:Category:Nursing specialties|nursing specialties]] such as [[acute care]], adult, family, [[Gerontological nursing|gerontology]], [[neonatal nursing|neonatology]], [[palliative care]], [[Pediatric nursing|pediatric]], [[Psychiatric nursing|psychiatric]], or [[women's health|obstetrics and gynecological nursing]].

More recently, universities have begun to offer Master of Science pre-registration nursing courses, which cover the registration process and nurse training of the undergraduate course, but with Masters-level academic components. This course was initially started in the University of the West of Scotland in the UK, and has since been included in other universities.

Both maternal and child health are interdependent and substantially contributing to high burden of [[Death|mortality]] worldwide. Every year, 289 000 women die due to complications in pregnancy and childbirth, and 6.6 million children below 5 years of age die of complications in the newborn period and of common childhood diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|title=Consultation on improving measurement of the quality of maternal, newborn and child care in health facilities|url=http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/128206/1/9789241507417_eng.pdf?ua=1|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (SSA), which includes [[Tanzania]], contribute higher proportion of maternal and child mortality. Due to considerable proportion of mortality being attributed by maternal and child health, the [[United Nations]] together with other international agencies incorporated the two into [[Millennium Development Goals]] (MDGs) 4 and 5. In this regard, Tanzania through the [[Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (Tanzania)|Ministry of Health and Social Welfare]] (MoHSW) adopted different strategies and efforts to promote safe motherhood and improve [[child survival]]. Similarly, in an effort to improve maternal and child health, Tanzania’s government has declared maternal and child health services to be exempt from user fees in government facilities.

==Maternal health indicators==

===Maternal mortality ratio===
Complications during pregnancy and childbirth are a leading cause of death and disability among women of reproductive age in developing countries. Statistically, maternal mortality contributes to only 2.3 per cent of the total mortality.&lt;ref name="UNDP"&gt;{{cite web|author=UNDP|title=Tanzania MDG 5: Improve maternal health|url=http://www.tz.undp.org/content/tanzania/en/home/mdgoverview/overview/mdg5/|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Maternal Mortality Ratio (MMR) represents the risk associated with each pregnancy.&lt;ref name="WHOMM"&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|title=Health statistics and information systems-MMR|url=http://www.who.int/healthinfo/statistics/indmaternalmortality/en/
|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; MMR is estimated by using both number of [[maternal deaths]] and live births. Many low-income countries have no or very little data and modelling is used to obtain a national estimate.&lt;ref name="WHOMM"/&gt; According to recent estimates in 2013, total maternal deaths and MMR in Tanzania are 7,900 and 410 per 100,000 live births respectively.&lt;ref name="COUNTDOWN"&gt;{{cite web|title=Countdown 2014 report for Tanzania|url=http://www.countdown2015mnch.org/documents/2014Report/TanzaniaURep_Country_Profile_2014.pdf|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main direct causes of maternal death are haemorrhages, infections, unsafe abortions, hypertensive disorders and obstructed labours. In relation to MDG 5, Tanzania is supposed to reach the MMR of 230 per 100,000 live births by 2015. Although Tanzania reduced MMR from 910 per 100,000 live births in 1990 to a recent data of 410 per 100,000 live births,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|title=Global Health Observatory Data Repository|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.MATMORT?lang=en|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; reaching the MDG 5 target by 2015 seems to be unmanageable. Reduction of maternal deaths is one of the main goals of the Tanzanian Poverty Reduction Strategy and the health sector reform program, but progress has been slow. The slow progress in reducing maternal mortality on Mainland Tanzania is compounded by the impact of the [[HIV]] and [[AIDS]] [[epidemic]].&lt;ref name="UNDP"/&gt; The fact that nearly half of births in Tanzania occur at home also contributes to the elevated maternal mortality rate.

===Antenatal care coverage===
Good care during pregnancy is important for the health of the mother and the development of the unborn baby.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|title=Antenatal care -chapter 2|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/publications/aonsectionIII_2.pdf|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many health problems in pregnant women can be prevented, detected and treated during antenatal care visits with trained health workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|title=Global Health Observatory (ANC)|url=http://www.who.int/gho/maternal_health/reproductive_health/antenatal_care_text/en/|accessdate=2 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151120203220/http://www.who.int/gho/maternal_health/reproductive_health/antenatal_care_text/en/|archivedate=20 November 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) recommends a minimum of four Antenatal care (ANC) visit. Tanzania is like other countries in [[Sub-Saharan Africa]] (SSA) with high coverage for at least one ANC visit and low coverage in terms of four or more ANC visits. The 2010 [[Demographic and Health Surveys]] (DHS) in Tanzania shows 96% and 43% of at least one ANC visit and four or more visits respectively.&lt;ref name="COUNTDOWN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TDHS"&gt;{{cite web |author=USAID |agency= Tanzania DHS |date=2010 |title= Demographic and Health Survey |url= http://dhsprogram.com/pubs/pdf/FR243/FR243%5B24June2011%5D.pdf |accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some progress have been observed in Tanzania about this indicator and the latest figure are likely to be higher than DHS figures. The only challenges remain to be the required four or more visits together with the quality of ANC services.

===Skilled birth deliveries===
This indicator is directly linked to a process of giving birth by pregnant woman, and most of maternal [[Death|mortality]] are likely to happen at this stage. Most maternal deaths result from haemorrhage, complications of unsafe [[abortion]], pregnancy-induced [[hypertension]], [[sepsis]] and [[obstructed labour]].&lt;ref name="UNFPA"&gt;{{cite web|author=UNFPA|title=REPRODUCTIVE HEALTH IN REFUGEE SITUATIONS: AN INTER-AGENCY FIELD MANUAL|url=https://www.unfpa.org/emergencies/manual/3.htm|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these proportions of causes for maternal deaths are likely to differ from one country to another. According to official estimates, more than 20 women die of pregnancy and childbirth-related complications every day in [[Tanzania]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=White Ribbon Alliance|title=TANZANIA JOINS GLOBAL EFFORTS TO SAVE MOTHERS, NEWBORN LIVES|url=http://whiteribbonalliance.org/wra-page-release/tanzania-joins-global-efforts-save-mothers-newborn-lives/|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Ensuring that mothers have access to a skilled attendant during labour can dramatically reduce the risk of death for the mother and newborn child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WAHA |title=Health topic: Maternal health |url=http://www.waha-international.org/?health-topics |accessdate=2 September 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150314002948/http://waha-international.org/?health-topics |archivedate=14 March 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 2010 [[Tanzania]] DHS, about 51% of deliveries were assisted by skilled personnel. While it was 41% in 1999 Tanzania DHS. Potentially the current figure national-wide will be more than 51 per cent. Shortage of health providers, among others, are limiting factors to be delivered by skilled provider. The ratio of doctors to patients in Tanzania is 1:25,000 and the ratio of nurses to patients is 1:23,000. While the ratio in the [[United States]] is 1:300.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jakaya Kikwete|title=THE FIGHT FOR MATERNAL AND CHILD HEALTH IN SUB-SAHARAN AFRICA|url=http://www.ghdnews.com/index.php/global-health-challenges/maternal-and-child-health/45-the-fight-for-maternal-and-child-health-in-sub-saharan-africa|publisher=GHD WINTER 2014 DIGITAL EDITION|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[President]] [[Jakaya Kikwete]] on May 2014 appealed to health workers in Tanzania to ensure that lives of women and children are not at risk during delivery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Lucas Lukumbo|title=PRESIDENT KIKWETE TO HEALTH WORKERS: YOU CAN STOP MATERNAL AND CHILD DEATHS|url=http://whiteribbonalliance.org/media/president-kikwete-health-workers-can-stop-maternal-child-deaths/|publisher=IPP MEDIA, White Ribbon Alliance|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In Tanzania, two thirds of women give birth in their own homes, because there are very few health facilities within reach that can provide life-saving emergency services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=White Ribbon Alliance|title=CAMPAIGN UPDATE: TANZANIA ONE STEP CLOSER TO LIFE SAVING CARE FOR WOMEN|url=http://whiteribbonalliance.org/opinions/campaign-update-tanzania-one-step-closer-life-saving-care-women/|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postnatal care coverage===
Every year in [[Africa]], at least 125,000 women and 870,000 newborns die in the first week after birth, yet this is when coverage and programmes are at their lowest along the continuum of care.&lt;ref name="WHOPMNCH"&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|title=Postnatal care -chapter 4|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/media/publications/aonsectionIII_4.pdf|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since up to 50 per cent of maternal deaths occurs after delivery, a midwife or a trained and supervised Traditional Birth Attendant (TBA) should visit all mothers as soon as possible within the first 24–48 hours after birth.&lt;ref name="UNFPA"/&gt; The 2010 figure in utilizing postnatal care in Tanzania was only 31 per cent according to TDHS.&lt;ref name="TDHS"/&gt;  Coverage of postnatal check-up within 4 hours after birth varies from 9 percent in the Lake zone to 34 percent in the Southern zone in Tanzania.&lt;ref name="TDHS"/&gt;  Postnatal care (PNC) programmes are among the weakest of all reproductive and child health programmes in [[Tanzania]] and [[Sub-Saharan African]] in general.&lt;ref name="WHOPMNCH"/&gt; Given the absence of PNC guidelines in Tanzania, the Reproductive and Child Health Section (RCHS) of the [[Ministry of Health and Social Welfare (Tanzania)|Ministry of Health and Social Welfare]] [Tanzania] reported in 2009 that is in the process of developing it to be used country-wide.&lt;ref name="MRISHO"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mrisho|date=2009|title= The use of antenatal and postnatal care: perspectives and experiences of women and health care providers in rural southern Tanzania|url=http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2393-9-10.pdf|publisher=BMC Pregnancy and Childbirth|accessdate=2 September 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern family planning use===
The policy environment for [[family planning]] in Tanzania is mixed, but promising. At the 2012 London Summit on Family Planning, President [[Kikwete]] highlighted Tanzania's continued efforts to improve family planning. He mentioned the National Strategy for Growth and Reduction of Poverty (MKUKUTA II) which has a strong family planning component, and the National Family Planning Costed Implementation Plan (2010) which endeavors to reach a contraceptive prevalence target of 60% of all women by 2015 and will require $88.2 million between 2010 and 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|url=http://advancefamilyplanning.org/tanzania|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like many countries in sub-Saharan Africa, Tanzania's once successful family planning program has slowed markedly, with rates of contraceptive prevalence well below levels needed to reach current demand and country goals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=FHI360|title=PROGRESS in Tanzania: National Family Planning Costed Implementation Program|url=http://www.fhi360.org/projects/progress-tanzania-national-family-planning-costed-implementation-program|accessdate=2 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Tanzania, 34.4 percent of married women in 2010 reported use of any method of contraception, while modern methods reached a prevalence of 27.4 per cent.&lt;ref name="TDHS"/&gt; Factors limiting contraceptive prevalence in Tanzania include widespread misconceptions and concerns about side-effects, low acceptance of long–acting methods, erratic supplies and a limited range of choices, gaps in provider knowledge and skills (along with provider bias), competing priorities pursuing scarce resources, limited male involvement, poor communication between spouses, and the perceived value of large families also contribute to low use of family planning methods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=PATHFINDER|title=Reproductive Health and Family Planning in Tanzania: The Pathfinder International Experience|url=http://www.pathfinder.org/publications-tools/pdfs/Reproductive-Health-and-Family-Planning-in-Tanzania-The-Pathfinder-International-Experience.pdf|accessdate=2 September 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723213857/http://www.pathfinder.org/publications-tools/pdfs/Reproductive-Health-and-Family-Planning-in-Tanzania-The-Pathfinder-International-Experience.pdf|archivedate=23 July 2015|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Child health indicators==

===Infant and Under-five mortality rate===
Both [[infant]] and under-five mortality rate assesses the child health status in a particular country. Children in sub-Saharan Africa are about over 16 times more likely to die before the age of five than children in developed regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|title=Fact sheet- reducing child mortality|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs178/en/|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanzania has reduced the [[infant mortality]] rate (IMR) of 101 to 38 per 1000 live births from 1990 to 2012 respectively.&lt;ref name="COUNTDOWN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TDHS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|title=Global Health Observatory Data Repository-Infant mortality|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.526?lang=en|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, it has reduced substantially the under-five mortality rate (U5MR) of 166 to 54 per 1000 live births from 1990 to 2012 respectively.&lt;ref name="COUNTDOWN"/&gt;&lt;ref name="TDHS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|title=Global Health Observatory Data Repository-Under 5 mortality|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.525?lang=en|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Malaria]] is the leading cause of death for Tanzanian children and is a major cause of maternal mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=GHI|title=Tanzania Global Health Initiative Strategy 2010 -2015|url=http://www.ghi.gov/whereWeWork/docs/TanzaniaStrategy.pdf|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tanzania is making considerable progress in the reduction of child mortality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=UNICEF|title=Tanzania’s progress in maternal and child health|url=http://www.unicef.org/tanzania/6906_10741.html|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In that respect, Tanzania is likely to achieve MDG 4 of reducing child mortality.&lt;ref name="UNDPMDG4"&gt;{{cite web|author=UNDP|title=Tanzania MDG4: Reduce child mortality|url=http://www.tz.undp.org/content/tanzania/en/home/mdgoverview/overview/mdg4/|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The most significant contribution to the reduction of under-five mortality is improved control measures of malaria, Acute Respiratory Infections, diarrhea; improved personal hygiene, environmental sanitation; and preventive, promotive as well as curative health services.&lt;ref name="UNDPMDG4"/&gt; Tanzania's average annual rate of reduction of child mortality over the last 15 years was 4.6%, while, the Millennium Development Goal rate set by UN is an annual average rate of reduction of 4.3%; this shows that Tanzania is moving faster! &lt;ref name="GAPMINDER"&gt;{{cite web|author=GAPMINDER|title=Tanzania: Fast drop in child mortality!|url=http://www.gapminder.org/news/tanzania-fast-drop-in-child-mortality/#.VAdgRfmSzRs|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hans Rosling]] in 2011 honored Tanzania that is moving faster than MDG rate.&lt;ref name="GAPMINDER"/&gt;

===Vaccination coverage===
In the recent past, Tanzania has been in a process of revitalization, with improvements in the planning process, community ownership and involvement, improving coverage, effective mobilization of funds for Expanded Program of Immunisation (EPI), improvements in safety of vaccine delivery and introduction of new and underutilized vaccines.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|title=Tanzania:Immunization and vaccines development (IVD)|url=http://www.afro.who.int/en/tanzania/country-programmes/3112-immunization-and-vaccines-development-ivd.html|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to 2010 Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) in Tanzania, 66 per cent at 12 months of age were fully immunised during the survey.&lt;ref name="TDHS"/&gt; The 2010 DHS in Tanzania which is the latest, presents the BCG coverage of 95.5%, Diphtheria tetanus toxoid and pertussis (DTP3) coverage of 88%; Polio (Pol3) coverage of 84.9% and Measles coverage of 84.5%. The proportion of children vaccinated against measles increased from 80 per cent in 2005 to 85 per cent in 2010.&lt;ref name="UNDPMDG4"/&gt; But the vaccination coverage in Tanzania presented to be more that 90% for each of the above vaccines according to [[World Health Organization]] in 2012 gives.&lt;ref name="WHOA824"&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|title=Global Health Observatory Data Repository-Immunization|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.A824?lang=en|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government of Tanzania via the Minister of Health and Social Welfare, has urged in 2012 that partners and stakeholders in the country to join the National Immunization Coordination Committee to ensure that all children in Tanzanian are covered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=IPP MEDIA|title=Minister: Children`s immunization coverage satisfactory|url=http://www.ippmedia.com/frontend/?l=48917|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Exclusive breastfeeding===
In Tanzania by 2010, [[breastfeeding]] was initiated within the first hour of birth in 46.1% of mothers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Victor|date=2013|title=Determinants of breastfeeding indicators among children less than 24 months of age in Tanzania: a secondary analysis of the 2010 Tanzania Demographic and Health Survey|url=http://bmjopen.bmj.com/content/3/1/e001529.full.pdf+html|publisher=BMJ Open|accessdate=3 September 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over 97 percent of mothers in Tanzania do breastfeed, however, the prevalence of exclusive breastfeeding in infants aged 0–6 months is 50 percent.&lt;ref name="TDHS"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|title=Global Health Observatory Data Repository -Exclusive breastfeeding under 6 months|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.1100?lang=en|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the national average reported to be 50% prevalence, one regional study focusing on Kilimanjaro region only revealed the general prevalence of 88.1% at one month, 65.5% at three months and 20.7% for an infant of six months of age, which is very low and did not vary between rural and urban.&lt;ref name="MGONGO"&gt;{{cite web|author=Mgongo|date=2013|title=Prevalence and predictors of exclusive breastfeeding among women in Kilimanjaro region, Northern Tanzania: a population based cross-sectional study|url=http://www.internationalbreastfeedingjournal.com/content/pdf/1746-4358-8-12.pdf|publisher=International Breastfeeding Journal|accessdate=3 September 2014|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; A [[multivariate analysis]] using 2010 TDHS data &lt;ref name="MGONGO"/&gt; revealed that the risk of delayed initiation of breastfeeding within 1 hour after birth was significantly higher among young mothers aged &lt;24 years, uneducated and employed mothers from rural areas who delivered by caesarean section and those who delivered at home and were assisted by traditional birth attendants or relatives. The risk factors associated with non-exclusive breastfeeding, during the first 6 months, were lack of professional assistance at birth and residence in urban areas.

===Child malnutrition===
[[Malnutrition]] in Tanzania is a contributing factor in an estimated 130 child deaths every day.&lt;ref name="UNICEF TANZANIA"&gt;{{cite web|author=UNICEF|title=Tanzania overview -nutrition|url=http://www.unicef.org/tanzania/10787_11047.html|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to 2010 TDHS, about 42 percent of children are stunted, 16 percent are underweight and 5 percent are wasted.&lt;ref name="TDHS"/&gt; Different efforts have been adopted in Tanzania to improve children nutrition status. Within a one-year interval from 2010 and 2011, significant reduction in malnutrition observed. In 2011 according to [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) estimates on child malnutrition in Tanzania, children aged &lt;5 years stunted was 34.8% in 2011; underweight was 13.6% in 2011; wasted was 6.6% in 2011 and overweight was 5.5% in 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|title=Global Health Observatory Data Repository -Child malnutrition|url=http://apps.who.int/gho/data/node.main.1095?lang=en|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some regions in Tanzania like [[Iringa]], [[Mbeya]] and [[Rukwa]] are among the five regions with the highest stunting and are all areas with high food production.&lt;ref name="UNICEF TANZANIA"/&gt; The case in Tanzania, is inconsistent with the common assumption that increasing agriculture and food production will automatically lead to improvements in nutrition.

==Partnership to improve maternal and child health==
Recently, [[Tanzania]] has experienced an increase in [[partnership]] with different UN organizations, NGOs, the government and health professional communities on improving maternal and child health. The advances in Maternal Newborn and Child Health (MNCH) that have occurred thus far are the result of programmes and initiatives conducted by government in partnership with UN organisations, NGOs, and health professional communities.
Some specific examples of action:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=WHO|title=TANZANIA TECHNICAL CONSULTATION ON THE WAY FORWARD FOR MATERNAL, NEWBORN AND CHILD HEALTH|url=http://www.who.int/pmnch/activities/countries/tanzania/en/index3.html|accessdate=3 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*The Tanzania [[UNICEF]] country office works in line with the Global Campaign on Children and [[AIDS]] to shed spotlight on the impact of [[HIV/AIDS]] on children. It also conducts evidence based programmes in the area of [[malaria]], and [[child survival]] with a focus on pneumonia, diarrhoea, malnutrition and water and sanitation.
*Another partner, [[Save the Children]] in Tanzania, focuses on interventions in education, healthcare and food security. Its strategy is based on close collaboration with the communities.
*Family Care International has launched the Skilled Care Initiative in Tanzania. This programme aims to ensure that high quality skilled care is available to pregnant women. This project is funded by the [[Bill &amp; Melinda Gates Foundation]].
*Engender Health in Tanzania focuses on family planning and Prevention Mother-to-Child transmission (PMTCT). They also respond to needs through counselling and outreach programmes among others. These and other actors are foundation of the partnerships.

A '''non-rebreather mask''' ('''NRB''', '''non-rebreather''', '''non-rebreather facemask''', etc.) is a device used in [[medicine]] to assist in the delivery of [[oxygen therapy]]. An NRB requires that the patient can breathe unassisted, but unlike low flow [[nasal cannula]], the NRB allows for the delivery of higher concentrations of [[oxygen]].

==Design==
[[File:NRBer.JPG|thumb|Patient with non-rebreather mask|non rebreather face mask]]
The non-rebreather mask covers both the nose and mouth of the patient and attaches with the use of an elastic cord around the patient's head. The NRB has an attached reservoir bag, typically 1 liter, that connects to an external [[oxygen tank]] or Bulk Oxygen Supply system. Before an NRB is placed on the patient, the reservoir bag is inflated to greater than two-thirds full of oxygen, at a rate of 15 liters per minute (lpm).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Daniel Limmer, EMT-P |author2=Michael F O'Keefe, MS, EMT-P |editor=Edward T. Dickinson, MD |title=Emergency Care (11th edition) |location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J. |publisher=Prentice Hall |year=2009 |isbn=978-0135005248 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately ¹⁄₃ of the air from the reservoir is depleted as the patient inhales, and it is then replaced by the flow from the O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; supply. If the bag becomes completely deflated, the patient will no longer have a source of air to breathe.

Exhaled air is directed through a [[check valve|one-way valve]] in the mask, which prevents the inhalation of room air and the re-inhalation of exhaled air. The valve, along with a sufficient seal around the patient's nose and mouth, allows for the administration of high concentrations of oxygen, approximately 60% - 80% O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Garcia JA, Gardner D, Vines D, Shelledy D, Wettstein R, Peters J (October 2005). "The Oxygen Concentrations Delivered by Different Oxygen Therapy Systems". Chest Meeting 128 (4): 389S–390S.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.rcjournal.com/abstracts/2003/?id=OF-03-257 |title=Delivery of High FiO2 |first= John |last= Earl}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Many textbooks report higher oxygen concentrations, however formal studies reporting these levels are not referenced to research. The patient must partially deflate the reservoir bag during inspiration or the high oxygen concentration will not be achieved, and the mask will provide only the liter flow rate setting on the flowmeter.

Ideally, a non-rebreather mask would not permit air from the surrounding environment to be inhaled. However, due to safety concerns regarding anti-suffocation protection in the event of a source gas failure (i.e. the oxygen cylinder being drained completely), one of the two one-way valves is normally removed, allowing inhalation of outside air to a significant degree.  However, as almost all non-rebreathing masks are disposable, and manufactured in 1 adult size, most (from decades of clinical observation) do not provide a good seal with an individual patient's face, thus permitting the inflow of large amounts of ambient air (air follows the path of least resistance), and diluting the oxygen provided.  Hence, very few patients receive anything close to 100% oxygen.  Very high flows (&gt; = 30 LPM) from the oxygen flowmeter are required to partially overcome room air dilution.  Further, the larger the patient's inspiratory flow rate, the greater the dilution from air. Very little effort is required by most patients, to inspire at flow rates in excess of 50 LPM (easily seen in the pulmonary function lab with routine spirometric testing).    

Partial rebreather masks are designed to capture the first 150ml of the exhaled breath into the reservoir bag for inhalation during the subsequent breath.  This portion of the breath was initially delivered at the end of inhalation and was therefore delivered to the "deadspace" anatomy where gas exchange did not occur. Therefore, there would be no depletion of oxygen nor gain of carbon dioxide during the rebreathing component.

==Usage==
The non-rebreather mask is utilized for patients with [[physical trauma]], chronic airway limitation, [[cluster headache]], [[smoke inhalation]], and [[carbon monoxide poisoning]], or any other patients who require high-concentration oxygen, but do not require breathing assistance. Patients uncomfortable with having a mask on their face, such as those with [[claustrophobia]], or patients with injuries to the mouth are more likely to benefit from a [[nasal cannula]], or passive ("blow-by") oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.lhsc.on.ca/resptherapy/rtequip/oxygen/prongs.htm |title= Oxygen Delivery Devices: Nasal Prongs|accessdate=2008-01-18 |first= L. |last= Dobkowski |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080109082348/http://www.lhsc.on.ca/resptherapy/rtequip/oxygen/prongs.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2008-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients who are unable to breathe on their own would require invasive or noninvasive mechanical ventilation.

{{Rights}}
'''Nursing home residents' rights''' are the legal and moral rights of the residents of a [[nursing home]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Nursing Home Residents' Rights |url=http://gerontologist.oxfordjournals.org/content/28/6/842.2.citation |journal=The Gerontologist |year=1988 |volume=28 |issue=6 |pages=842–843 |doi=10.1093/geront/28.6.842a}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Legislation exists in various jurisdictions to protect such rights.  An early example of a statute protecting such rights is Florida statute 400.022, enacted in 1980, and commonly known as the ''Residents' Rights Act.''&lt;ref name=flomb&gt;{{cite web|title=Residents' Rights|url=http://ombudsman.myflorida.com/ResidentsRights.php|website=Florida's Long-Term Care Ombudsman Program|publisher=State of Florida, Department of Elder Affairs|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;''

Specific rights protected vary greatly by jurisdiction. Types of rights protected include: [[dignity]], [[medical privacy]], pecuniary, dietary and visitation rights. Process rights, such as right of complaint, are also sometimes protected.&lt;ref&gt;This paragraph summarizes material in the body; details and citations are found below. For examples of dignity and privacy rights, see [[#United Kingdom]] and [[#Canada]]. For pecuniary rights and rights of complaint, see [[#United States]] and [[#United Kingdom]]. See [[#Canada]] and [[#United States]] for rights of visitation.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Motivations for residents' rights==
In the United States, concerns about poor quality care and ineffective regulation of nursing homes date back to the 1970s. Early regulation focused on the ability of nursing homes to provide care, rather than on the quality of the care provided or the experience of the individuals receiving care. In the 1980s, particularly in response to an influential [[Institute of Medicine]] (IoM) report, the US federal government moved to address these concerns by enacting more resident-focused regulations, and among these were a number of new quality-of-life rights for residents of nursing homes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Improving the quality of care in nursing homes |year=1986 |publisher=Committee on Nursing Home regulation, Institute Of Medicine (U.S.) |page= |quote= | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S9DG-fU7lGcC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=dbdFTNz8E8L38Aa7_rDqBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDQQ6wEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |isbn=978-0-309-03646-7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|author1=Joshua M.

==Australia==
Advocates for residents' rights in Australia have established a ''Charter of Residents' Rights and Responsibilities'' and the [[Department of Health and Ageing]] provides an official unit to deal with complaints.  In 1987, the government  introduced substantial reform and regulation which included a program to monitor standards.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |title=Regulation and Reform: Promoting Residents' Rights in Australian Nursing Homes |author1=Diane Gibson |author2=Gavin Turrell |author3=Anne Jenkins |doi=10.1177/144078339302900105 |journal=Journal of Sociology |date = March 1993|volume=29 |number=1 |pages=73–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Canada==
Nursing home residents' rights in Canada appear to have been primarily legislated at the [[Canadian province|provincial]] level. In [[Ontario]], for instance,&lt;ref name=subjurs&gt;The sub-jurisdictional examples within nations are currently drawn from the largest sub-divisions by population. One can imagine adding examples based on other criteria, such as degrees of protection of rights.&lt;/ref&gt; the ''Long Term Care Homes Act 2007'' contains a "Residents' Bill of Rights", including, ''inter alia'', the rights to be treated with courtesy and respect; to privacy in treatment; to be informed of one's medical condition and treatment; to [[Informed consent#Medical procedures|consent]] to or refuse treatment; to [[medical privacy|confidentiality of medical records]] and treatment; to receive visitors; and, when near death, to have family members present 24 hours a day.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.health.gov.on.ca/english/public/program/ltc/25_standards.html#1 |title=Seniors' Care: Maintaining Standards of Care in Long-Term Care Homes |date= |accessdate=2010-07-18 |quote= |publisher=[[Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care (Ontario)]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New Zealand==
Since 1994, New Zealand has protected residents rights' (and rights of the disabled more broadly) under the [[Health and Disability Commissioner Act 1994|Health and Disability Commissioner Act]], including rights to respect, freedom from discrimination and coercion, dignity, communication in a language the resident can understand, information and informed consent, and right of complaint.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hdc.org.nz/ |title=Health and Disability Commissioner |format= |pages= |date= |accessdate=2010-07-25 |quote= |publisher=Health and Disability Commissioner |location=New Zealand }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.legislation.govt.nz/regulation/public/1996/0078/latest/whole.html |title=Health and Disability Commissioner (Code of Health and Disability Services Consumers' Rights) Regulations 1996 (SR 1996/78) |pages= |date=10 June 2004 |accessdate=2010-07-25 |quote= |publisher=Parliamentary Counsel Office |location=New Zealand }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United Kingdom==
Residents' rights in the UK appear to have been primarily legislated at the [[Countries of the United Kingdom|country]] level. In [[England]], for instance,&lt;ref name=subjurs/&gt; the [[Care Quality Commission]], the health and social care regulator for England, describes national minimum standards under the ''Care Standards Act 2000'' for services in care homes, including [[dignity]] and privacy rights, dietary and pecuniary rights, and the right to complain if one is unhappy with the care provided.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cqc.org.uk/usingcareservices/socialcare/usingsocialcareservices/yourrights.cfm |title=Your rights  |date= |accessdate=2010-07-18 |quote= |publisher=[[Care Quality Commission]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
Residents' rights in the US are protected at both the [[United States federal law|federal]] and [[U.S. state|state]] level.

===Federal law===
In 1980 the [[Civil Rights of Institutionalized Persons Act]] was passed to protect the civil rights of, amongst others, residents of nursing homes and similar facilities.
In 1987, amendments known collectively as the Federal [[Nursing Home Reform Act]], including a robust section on nursing home residents' rights, were attached to an [[Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Act of 1987]] (OBRA '87) which was then enacted into law and codified at section 483 of Volume 42 of the [[Code of Federal Regulations]] and related [[United States Code]] sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.allhealth.org/briefingmaterials/obra87summary-984.pdf |title=OBRA '87 Summary |date= |accessdate=2010-07-20 |quote= |publisher=Alliance for Health care reform |format=pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/42/1396r- |title=42 US § 1396r |date= |accessdate=2010-07-20 |quote= |publisher=Cornell University Law School }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.access.gpo.gov/nara/cfr/waisidx_02/42cfr483_02.html |title=Title 42, PART 483--REQUIREMENTS FOR STATES AND LONG TERM CARE FACILITIES |date= |accessdate=2010-07-20 |quote= |publisher=US Government Printing Office }}&lt;/ref&gt;  These required nursing homes to provide facilities to ensure that residents had a high quality of life, good physical and mental activities, and were able to participate in the administration of the home.  Appeals to an [[ombudsman]] in case of dispute were to be facilitated.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z73O149TUXsC&amp;pg=PT304 |title=Geriatric education for emergency medical services |publisher=American Geriatrics Society}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the act's protections may or may not apply to some nursing home residents whose nursing homes receive only state funds, and do not participate in [[Medicare (United States)|Medicare]] or [[Medicaid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nursing-home-abuse-resource.com/nursing_home_abuse/history.html |title=History of Nursing Homes |accessdate=2010-07-20 |publisher=eJustice }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some rights provided by federal law as of 2010 include rights to dignity, privacy, freedom from [[discrimination]], freedom from restraint, to be informed of medical care and treatment, pecuniary rights, visitation, rights of complaint and protection against transfer and unfair discharge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.medicare.gov/Publications/Pubs/pdf/02174.pdf |title=Guide to Choosing a Nursing Home |date= |format=pdf |pages=49–54 |accessdate=2010-07-19 |quote= |publisher=Centers for Medicare &amp; Medicaid Services }}&lt;/ref&gt; Specific rights include: choice of physician and involvement in treatment options; a right to be admitted without a third-party guarantee as a condition of admission; freedom from improper physical or chemical restraints; freedom from abuse; right to be treated with dignity; right to reasonable accommodation; right to participate in planning care and treatment and any changes in care and treatment; right to informed consent in language patient can understand; right to refuse treatment; right of family and Ombudsman to immediately access resident and have reasonable access to facility; right to privacy, confidentiality, and visitors; a right to not be transferred unless necessary to meet residents' needs, resident no longer requires care, safety of others is endangered, resident has failed to make own payments, or facility no longer operates; right to readmission; right to appeal hearings; right to have necessary care and services for highest practicable well-being; right to have adequate number of personnel; and, various rights respecting the residents' financial matters and need for proper notice and information.&lt;ref name=canhr_outline/&gt;

===State law===
In addition to the rights required by federal law and regulation, additional rights and protections may be extended to residents of long-term care facilities under state law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Nursing Home Residents’ Rights|url=http://ltcombudsman.org/uploads/files/support/Module-2.pdf|website=The National Long-Term Care Ombudsman Resource Center|publisher=National Consumer Voice|accessdate=9 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====California====
In [[California]],&lt;ref name="subjurs" /&gt; certain rights are protected. As of 2010, these include:  a contract will not require the resident to provide advance notice of voluntary discharge; arbitration agreements may not be required as a condition of admission; an arbitration agreement may be rescinded by the resident or his or her agent within 30 days of signing it; a third party guaranty of payment may not be a condition of admission; Facility may not transfer or discharge resident for switching to [[Medi-Cal]], or while qualification for Medi-Cal is still being determined; resident has a right to be notified in writing about discharges and transfers; resident has a right to appeal discharge and transfer decisions; resident has a right to return to a facility after a temporary stay in a hospital—to the first available bed, with Medi-Cal paying for the first seven days; resident has the right to visitors, and to privacy; and, that there shall be an adequate number of personnel on staff.&lt;ref name="canhr_outline"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://canhr.org/factsheets/nh_fs/html/fs_outline_resrights.htm |title=Outline of Nursing Home Residents’ Rights |date= |accessdate=2010-07-19 |quote= |publisher=California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cdph.ca.gov/healthinfo/pages/nursinghomepatient.aspx |title=Nursing Home Residents Rights |date= |accessdate=2010-07-19 |quote= |publisher=California Department of Public health }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are still other protections for California residents, in part, because California incorporates federal law with respect to nursing home protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://canhr.org |title=California Advocates for Nursing Home Reform |publisher=CANHR |accessdate=2010-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.leginfo.ca.gov/pub/05-06/bill/sen/sb_1201-1250/sb_1248_bill_20060928_chaptered.html |title=Senate Bill 1248 |publisher=Senator Alquist |accessdate=2010-07-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Florida====
[[Florida]] enacted nursing home reform in 2016 through its Chapter 400 Residents' Rights legislation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2016 Florida Statutes: Title XXIX: Public Health. Chapter 400: Nursing Homes and Related Health Care Facilities|url=http://www.leg.state.fl.us/Statutes/index.cfm?App_mode=Display_Statute&amp;URL=0400-0499/0400/Sections/0400.022.html|publisher=State of Florida|accessdate=7 July 2017|date=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation allows for civil lawsuits brought on behalf of the victim or the victim’s survivors, to enforce the resident’s rights. This allowed nursing home corporations to be held accountable by juries, thereby creating a financial disincentive to bad nursing home care.&lt;ref name=flomb/&gt;

====Illinois====
In [[Illinois]], residents in nursing homes have the right to be fully informed of available services and the charges of each service. They have the right to be informed of all facility rules and regulations, including a written copy of all residents rights. Illinois nursing home residents have the right to receive information in a language they understand: English, Spanish, Braille, or any other language they wish to receive it in.

Residents have the right to complain to the staff or any other person without the fear of reprisal and are able to file a complaint with the state survey and certification agency. They have the right to participate in one's own care which includes receiving adequate and appropriate care. And are also able to participate in their own assessment, care-planning, treatment and discharge. Residents are able to refuse any medication or treatments and is always able to review one's medical record. Residents have the right to privacy and confidentiality regarding all medical, personal, or financial affairs.

Residents also have the rights to make independent choices, these include: Making personal decisions such as what to wear and how to spend free time, choose their own physician, participate in community activities that are both inside and outside of the nursing home, organize and participate in a resident council, and manage one's own financial affairs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ltcombudsman.org/issues/residents-rights#rights|title=Residents' Rights| website=ltcombudsman.org |publisher=National Consumer Voice}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Wisconsin====
In [[Wisconsin]], residents have the right to dignity.  This means they have the right to be valued as an individual, to maintain and enhance their self-worth, to be treated with courtesy, respect and dignity, free from humiliation, harassment or threats.  They have the right to privacy.  They have the right to personal privacy during care and treatment, the right to confidentiality concerning their personal and medical information as well as the privacy to send and receive mail without interference. Residents have the right to access quality care for all residents, and to be told in advance about care and treatment, including all risks and benefits.

Residents have the right to remain in the facility unless there is a valid, legal reason for transfer or discharge and the resident will receive a 30-day written notice with the reason for the transfer or discharge, including appeal rights and information. Nursing home residents have the right to be offered choices and allowed to make decisions, and can expect that the facility will accommodate the individuals needs and preferences. Residents have the right to accept or refuse care and treatment, and are able to choose their own health care providers including their doctor and pharmacy of choice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://longtermcare.state.wi.us/|title=You Have Rights|website=state.wi.us|publisher=State of Wisconsin Board on Aging and Long-Term Care| accessdate=25 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="41304">'''Obesity in North Africa and the Middle East''' is a notable health issue. In 2005, the [[World Health Organization]] measured that 1.6 billion people were [[overweight]] and 400 million were [[obese]].  It estimates that by the year 2015, 2.3 billion people will be overweight and 700 million will be obese.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization"&gt;{{cite web|first=World Health Organization|title=Obesity and Overweight|url=http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs311/en/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Middle East, including the [[Arabian Peninsula]], [[Eastern Mediterranean]], Turkey and Iran, and North Africa, are no exception to the worldwide increase in obesity. Subsequently, some call this trend the [[New World Syndrome]].&lt;ref name="Stewart Godwin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Godwin|first=Stewart|title=Globalization, Education, and Emiratisation: A Study of the United Arab Emirates|year=2006|pages=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lifestyle changes associated with the discovery of oil and the subsequent increase in wealth is one contributing factor.

[[Urbanization]] has occurred rapidly and has been accompanied by new technologies that promote [[sedentary lifestyle]]s.&lt;ref name="Barry Popkin" /&gt; Due to accessibility of private cars, television, and household appliances, the population as a whole is engaging in less physical activity. The rise in caloric and fat intake in a region where exercise is not a defining part of the culture has added to the overall increased percentages of overweight and obese populations.&lt;ref name="Mahroos and Al-Roomi" /&gt; In addition, women are more likely to be overweight or obese due to cultural norms and perceptions of appropriate female behavior and occupations inside and outside of the home.&lt;ref name="Abdulrahman Al-Nuaim" /&gt;

==Obesity==
The medical condition of being [[overweight]] or [[obesity]] is defined as "abnormal or excessive fat accumulation that may impair health".&lt;ref name="World Health Organization" /&gt; It is measured through the [[Body Mass Index|Body Mass Index (BMI)]], defined as a person's weight, in kilograms, divided by the square of the person's height, in meters.  If an individual has a BMI of 25–29, he or she is overweight. Having a BMI of 30 or more means an individual is obese. The greater the BMI, the greater the risk of [[Chronic (medicine)|chronic]] diseases as a result of obesity. These diseases include [[cardiovascular disease]]s, [[diabetes]], [[musculoskeletal disorder]]s, [[cancer]], and premature death.&lt;ref name="World Health Organization" /&gt;

==Cause==
The MONICA Project, sponsored by the [[World Health Organization]], discovered that 30% of the population in the [[Arab World]] is overweight or obese, including adolescents and adults.&lt;ref name="Roya Kelishadi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Kelishadi|first=Roya|title=Obesity and Associated Modifiable Environmental Factors in Iranian Adolescents: Isfahan Healthy Heart Program - Heart Health Promotion from Childhood|year=2003|pages=439}}&lt;/ref&gt; This percentage is smaller for North African countries than oil-producing countries, but is still a prevalent trend.&lt;ref name="Barry Popkin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Popkin|first=Barry|title=The Obesity Epidemic is a Worldwide Phenomenon|year=1998|pages=109}}&lt;/ref&gt; The spread of the Western lifestyle, defined as "the intake of attractive energy dense food with undesirable composition, increased consumption of animal fats and sugars and reduced consumption of [[dietary fiber]], along with a lack of sufficient physical activity", is one of the leading causes.&lt;ref name="Roya Kelishadi" /&gt; Specifically in the Arabian Peninsula, "physical activity of the population has significantly diminished with the availability of housemaids, private cars, television, and sophisticated household appliances.

=== Turkey ===
In 2001–2002, 36.8% of the population was overweight and 23.5% obese.&lt;ref name="IASO Adults" /&gt; In that same year, 11.4% of boys and 10.3% of girls age 12–17 were overweight.&lt;ref name="Childhood IASO" /&gt; The occurrence of diabetes is higher among women than men.&lt;ref name="Satman" /&gt;

Obesity and being overweight is higher among women for several reasons. A majority of women do not have jobs outside of the home and lead more sedentary lifestyles as a result. Housework is often the only source of physical activity for women, as there is no prior tradition of women participating in sports.  Individuals living in urban areas are more likely to be overweight or obese because of the availability of public transportation and the sedentary lifestyle.  A lack of knowledge about diabetes and the health consequences also contribute to the high percentage of excessive weight.&lt;ref name="Satman"&gt;{{cite web|last=Satman|first=Ilhan|title=Population-Based Study of Diabetes and Risk Characteristics in Turkey Results of the Turkish Diabetes Epidemiology Study (TURDEP) |url=http://care.diabetesjournals.org/content/25/9/1551.full|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Israel ===
{{further|Health in Israel|Israeli paradox}}

Obesity rates in Israel are below the average for [[OECD]] nations, with an obesity rate of 14% for adults in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.health.gov.il/English/News_and_Events/Spokespersons_Messages/Pages/23112011_2e.aspx OECD Health at a Glance 2011: Key findings for Israel] Israel Ministry of Health, www.health.gov.il, Publish Date:23/11/2011 11:15&lt;/ref&gt; Socioeconomic status was one factor that impacted overweight and obesity percentages, particularly for women. Women in lower classes were four times as likely to be overweight or obese as women in upper classes. Only 20.2% of the entire population reported that they exercise for twenty minutes or more three times a week.&lt;ref name="Kaluski"/&gt;

The frequency of exercise among the Jewish Israeli population was twice as high as that for the Arab population. Men and women of Jewish descent are less likely to be of an unhealthy weight then Arab men and women.&lt;ref name="Kaluski"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Kaluski|first=D. Nitzan|title=Prevalence of Obesity in Israel|journal=Obesity Reviews|volume=6|issue=2|pages=115–6|doi=10.1111/j.1467-789X.2005.00168.x|pmid=15836461|year=2005|last2=Berry|first2=E. M.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Jordan ===
This is attributed to a change in [[diet (nutrition)|diet]], a lack of physical activity,&lt;ref name="Mahroos and Al-Roomi" /&gt; urbanization, and new technologies.&lt;ref name="Barry Popkin" /&gt;

=== Lebanon ===
23.4% of boys and 19.7% of girls were overweight in 1996.&lt;ref name="Childhood IASO" /&gt; Among university students at [[Lebanese American University]] in 2008, more male students were overweight or obese than female students. 37% of males were overweight and 13.6% were obese, while 13.6% of females were overweight and 3.2% were obese.&lt;ref name="Najat Yahia"&gt;{{cite book|last=Yahia|first=Najat|title=Eating Habits and Obesity among Lebanese University Students|year=2008|displayauthors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current trend towards obesity is influenced by more than the shift from [[Mediterranean cuisine|traditional Mediterranean]] to fast food. Individuals who had a low level of education, were non-smokers, and had a family history of obesity were more likely to have an unhealthy body weight.&lt;ref name="Abla Mehio Sibai"/&gt; Although females at the Lebanese American University were more likely to snack between meals than their male counterparts, they have are more motivation to be thin than males due to sex differences in physical attraction.&lt;ref name="Najat Yahia"/&gt;

=== Bahrain ===
The [[Food and Agriculture Organization]] estimates that almost 66% of the adult population is overweight or obese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=FAO|title=Bahrain: Nutrition Country Profiles|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/AGN/nutrition/BHR_en.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2000, it was determined that amongst children age 12–17, 29.9% of boys and 42.4% of girls were overweight.&lt;ref name="Childhood IASO" /&gt; The MONICA project, sponsored by the WHO, found that 15.6% of boys and 17.4% of girls in high school were obese.&lt;ref name="Roya Kelishadi" /&gt; Currently 15% of the population suffers from [[diabetes]].&lt;ref name="Diabetes Summit"/&gt;

Increased consumption of fast food and predominance of sedentary lifestyles have led to this occurrence. These unhealthy eating habits are reinforced in school canteens, where high fat and high [[carbohydrate]] foods such as pizza, burgers, sandwiches, and [[za'atar]], are available for lunch. Between meal times, children prefer French fries, chocolate, and soda, which lack [[micronutrient]]s and dietary fiber.&lt;ref name="Abdulrahman Musaiger"&gt;{{cite book|last=Musaiger|first=Abdulrahman O|title=Nutrient Composition of Foods Provided by School Canteens in Bahrain|year=2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kuwait ===
From 1980 to 1993, the percentage of individuals age 18–29 that were overweight rose from 30.6% to 54.4% and the percentage of those who were overweight increased from 12.8% to 24.6%.&lt;ref name="A.N. Al-Isa"&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Isa|first=A.N.|title=Obesity among Kuwaiti University Students: An Explorative Study|year=1999|pages=223}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The number of women who are either overweight or obese has jumped to 80% in 2010.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;{{cite web|first=FAO|title=Kuwait: Nutrition Country Profiles|url=http://www.fao.org/ag/AGN/nutrition/KWT_en.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the book "Top 10 of Everything 2011", the women of Kuwait ranked 5th for the highest percentage of obesity.&lt;ref name="Ahmad Saeid"&gt;{{cite book|last=Saeid|first=Ahmad|title=Kuwaiti Women Place Fifth Worldwide in Obesity|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, it was determined that amongst children age 10–14, 30% of boys and 31.8% of girls were overweight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=IASO|title=Global Childhood Overweight|url=http://www.iaso.org/policy/.../global-trends-childhood-overweight|work=2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120801175656/http://www.iaso.org/policy/.../global-trends-childhood-overweight|archivedate=2012-08-01|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Dasman Center for Research and Treatment of Diabetes, 15% of the adult population has diabetes, with 50% of adults over 45 living with the disease. 22 of every 100 children have developed diabetes as a result of an unhealthy weight.&lt;ref name="Velina Nacheva"&gt;{{cite book|last=Nacheva|first=Velina|title=Dasman Center Raises Nutrition Awareness|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The increased risk of excess weight or obesity is due to a combination of overeating energy-dense, high-fat foods and sedentary lifestyles.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4 /&gt; Meals consisting of processed ingredients with [[preservative]]s, [[saturated fat]]s, and [[hydrogenated oil]] are preferred over traditional foods. Advertisements for unhealthy junk food are seen everywhere and public schools sell candy, chocolate, and soda to their students.&lt;ref name="Hussain Al-Qatari"&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Qatari|first=Hussain|title=Packing Obesity: A Peek into a Student's Lunch Box|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically in Kuwaiti universities, other factors include eating between meals, marital status, and a male domination of sports.&lt;ref name="A.N. Al-Isa" /&gt;

=== Oman ===
The key factors to these high obesity levels are the adoption of [[Western pattern diet|eating habits in the Western lifestyle]]. The youth population consumes more fat, milk, and meat than previous generations.&lt;ref name="Abla Mehio Sibai"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sibai|first=Abla Mehio|title=Prevalence and Covariates of Obesity in Lebanon: Findings from the First Epidemiological Study|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Qatar ===
36.5% of boys and 23.6% of girls age 12–17 were overweight in 2003.&lt;ref name="Childhood IASO" /&gt; By 2015, it is predicted that 73% of women and 69% of men will be obese.&lt;ref name="Shawn Baldwin"&gt;{{cite book|last=Baldwin|first=Shawn|title=Privilege Pulls Qatar Toward Unhealthy Choices|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the International Association for the Study of Obesity, Qatar has the 6th highest rate of obesity among boys in the Middle East and North Africa region.  It is also ranked 5th for having the highest percentage of people between 20 and 79 with diabetes.&lt;ref name="Childhood IASO" /&gt;  Currently 16% of the population suffers from diabetes.&lt;ref name="Diabetes Summit" /&gt;

One reason for the obesity trend is the lack of exercise and poorly designed [[pedestrian]] friendly cities. "Like other oil-rich nations, Qatar has leaped across decades of development in a short time, leaving behind the physically demanding life of the desert for air-conditioned comfort, servants, and fast food".&lt;ref name="Childhood IASO" /&gt; Although the type of food eaten has changed, the cultural traditions surrounding food have not. Food is often consumed communally, making it nearly impossible to ensure proper portions. A person who does not eat when food is offered is seen as offensive and shameful. It is also normal within Qatari society to be obese.&lt;ref name="Childhood IASO" /&gt;

=== Saudi Arabia ===
Across the whole population from 1995–2000, 36.9% were overweight and 35.6% were obese.&lt;ref name="IASO Adults" /&gt; Rates were high amongst children aged 5–17, as 16.7% of boys and 19.4% of girls were overweight.&lt;ref name="Childhood IASO" /&gt; By 2006, 52% of men, 66% of women, 18% of teenagers, and 15% of preschoolers were overweight or obese.&lt;ref name="Fitness Sinful"&gt;{{cite web|first=Associated Press|title=Fitness Sinful for Women in Saudi Arabia?|url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/12857161/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2008, 17.99% of deaths were caused by cardiovascular disease.&lt;ref name="Saudi Health Statistical"/&gt; During this year, 95% of the 424,968 total appointments to diabetics clinics were made for Saudi citizens.  55% of these diabetic citizens were women and 44% were men.&lt;ref name="Saudi Health Statistical"&gt;{{cite book|title=Saudi Arabia: Health Statistical Year Book|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The latest national prevalence for childhood obesity (ages 5 to 18) in Saudi Arabia reported: 23.1% were overweight, 9.3% were obese and 2% were severely obese (2%) (El-Mouzan et al., 2010).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2886870 | pmid=20427936 | doi=10.4103/0256-4947.62833 | volume=30 | title=Prevalence of overweight and obesity in Saudi children and adolescents | year=2010 | journal=Ann Saudi Med | pages=203–8 | last1 = El Mouzan | first1 = MI | last2 = Foster | first2 = PJ | last3 = Al Herbish | first3 = AS | last4 = Al Salloum | first4 = AA | last5 = Al Omer | first5 = AA | last6 = Qurachi | first6 = MM | last7 = Kecojevic | first7 = T}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Part of the reason for the high rate of overweight and obesity within the population are urban residents that consume hypercaloric foods while maintaining a sedentary lifestyle. The less-than physically demanding lifestyle urban residents lead is linked to a high level of education and income.&lt;ref name="Abdulrahman Al-Nuaim"&gt;{{cite book|last=Al-Nuaim|first=Abdulrahman A|title=Overweight and Obesity in Saudi Arabia Adult Population: Role of Socio-Demographic Variables|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, women had an increased risk of obesity because of cultural and religious beliefs that require women to stay at home as a housewife.&lt;ref name="Abdulrahman Al-Nuaim"/&gt; Women are prohibited from using hotel gyms and pools and are targets of harassment when they exercise publicly. This is based on the belief that giving women the freedom to exercise would lead to the corruption and decline of the nation. In schools, physical activity for girls is avoided because some fear that changing clothes outside of the home would cause girls to lose their shyness, an admirable moral quality.&lt;ref name="Fitness Sinful"/&gt;

=== United Arab Emirates ===

In 1999, 24.8% of boys and 89.2% of girls age 4–18 were overweight.&lt;ref name="Childhood IASO"&gt;{{cite web|first=IASO|title=Global Childhood Overweight|url=http://www.iotf.org/database/.../GlobalChildhoodOverweightMay2010.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This number increased to 25% in 2008. As a result, 13.5% of the population had diabetes in 2000. This number is estimated to rise to 19.3% by 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Michael|title=The Weight of Affluence|year=2010|pages=86}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently 20% of the population suffers from diabetes.&lt;ref name="Diabetes Summit"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Diabetes Summit be hosted in Dubai on October 8th and 9th|url=http://www.ameinfo.com/242789.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population, especially children, over-consume food rich in carbohydrates, salt, fat, and processed sugar. This health problem is exacerbated due to the lack of an exercise culture.&lt;ref name="Michael Reid" /&gt; The recent availability of wealth due to oil has allowed Emiratis to purchase luxury items, including imported food and tobacco products.&lt;ref name="Stewart Godwin" /&gt; The marketing of such products is effective on the youth population. There is little to no awareness of the health impact of these items among the population. Another factor of obesity risk is prevalence of the cultural notion that a fat child is healthy, while a thin one is sick.&lt;ref name="Michael Reid"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reid|first=Michael|title=The Weight of Affluence|year=2010|pages=87}}&lt;/ref&gt; Childhood obesity in UAE may be linkedin to excessive use of technology as 9 in 10 children have access to handheld devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://mena.yougov.com/en/news/2018/07/16/childhood-obesity-may-be-linked-excessive-use-tech/|title=Childhood obesity linked to technology overuse|last=Karmakar|first=Prasenjit|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Iran ===
In 1988, Iran was one of the top seven countries with the highest rate of childhood obesity.&lt;ref name="Roya Kelishadi" /&gt; In 2005, 33.7% of adults were at risk of developing [[metabolic syndrome]]. Eight million Iranians already live with this syndrome.&lt;ref name="Reza Malekzadeh"&gt;{{cite book|last=Malekzadeh|first=Reza|title=Obesity Pandemic: An Iranian Perspective|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, 24.7% of boys and 26.8% of girls age 6 were overweight.&lt;ref name="Childhood IASO" /&gt;

One of the major reasons for increased obesity is urbanization. In 2005, an average Iranian citizen consumed 42 liters of soda per year, as well as 40% more carbohydrates, 30% more fat, and 40% more food than the body needs. The greater availability of fast food and junk food in combination with a low activity lifestyle has contributed to the obesity trend.&lt;ref name="Reza Malekzadeh"/&gt; Other factors include the impact of technology and a high consumption of rice and bread. Many families with a moderate income are limited in the foods they are able to afford, resulting in a higher incidence of obese children. However, childhood obesity is not a concern because it is believed that these children will outgrow their fatness as they age. The health impact of childhood obesity is unknown.&lt;ref name="Roya Kelishadi"/&gt;

=== Algeria ===
In 2003, 16.4% of the total population was obese.&lt;ref name="IASO Adults" /&gt; In 2006, 10.3% of boys and 8.7% of girls age 6–10 were overweight.&lt;ref name="Childhood IASO" /&gt;

=== Egypt ===
In 1996, Egypt had the highest average BMI in the world at 26.3.&lt;ref name="R Martorell"&gt;{{cite book|last=Martorell|first=R|title=Obesity in Women from Developing Countries|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1998, 1.6% of 2- to 6-year-olds, 4.9% of 6- to 10-year-olds, 14.7% of 10- to 14-year-olds, and 13.4% of 14- to 18-year-olds were obese. 45% of urban women and 20% of the rural population were obese.&lt;ref name="Osman Galal" /&gt;

Obesity rates rose as oils, fat, and sugars were more regularly consumed, beginning in the 1990s. The cultural appreciation of heavier female bodies is a factor.&lt;ref name="Osman Galal" /&gt; Another explanation is the degree to which food is the center of social events and special occasions. Heavy consumption of [[starch]]y and fatty foods without the presence of a health-conscious exercise culture is a major factor. As parents teach this lifestyle to their children, the prevalence of [[childhood obesity]] increases.&lt;ref name="Amira El-Noshokaty"&gt;{{cite book|last=El-Noshokaty|first=Amira|title=Fighting Fat|year=2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, Egyptian teenagers drink three times as much soda as milk. Ten percent of males and females drink five or more cans of soda a day, which can lead to early [[osteoporosis]] in women in the future. These food habits are reinforced by junk food advertisements and the availability of unhealthy food at supermarkets. As a result, teenagers are three times as likely to be overweight than they were 20 years ago.&lt;ref name="Leila Reem"&gt;{{cite book|last=Reem|first=Leila|title=What We Eat|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/704/li1.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Palestinian territories ===

According to the World Health Organization, obesity affects 26.8% of the Palestinian population (23.3% males, 30.8% females). This is mostly due to decreased physical activity and greater than necessary food consumption, particularly with an increase in energy coming from fat. Two other factors are smoking and urbanization. In addition, "leisure-time physical activity is not a common concept in the Palestinian context, especially for rural women, where lack of sex-segregated facilities and cultural norms are prohibitive factors." Women in urban areas face similar cultural restrictions.

=== Morocco ===
Adolescent girls are at a greater risk of becoming obese.&lt;ref name="Najat Mokhtar"&gt;{{cite book|last=Mokhtar|first=Najat|title=Diet Culture and Obesity in North Africa|year=2001|displayauthors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Obesity is linked to a greater availability of food, particularly from the West, and an increasingly sedentary lifestyle in urban areas. A woman who has a low level of schooling or no education in urban areas is significantly more likely to be obese. She, along with the general public, are not aware of the medical conditions that result from obesity. Rather, female fatness is embraced as it "is viewed as a sign of social status and is a cultural symbol of beauty, fertility, and prosperity".&lt;ref name="Najat Mokhtar"/&gt; Being thin is a sign of sickness or poverty.&lt;ref name="M Rguibi"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rguibi &amp; R Belahsen|first=M.|title=Fattening Practices Among Moroccan Saharawi Women|year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mauritania ===
In [[Mauritania]], the concept of beauty is embodied through the practice of ''[[leblouh]]'' ("fattening"). Before marriage, girls intentionally overeat and perform limited physical activity for 40 days in order to be attractive for their soon-to-be husbands. Women will repeat this process if they want to gain weight after marriage. It is believed that traditional clothing of these ethnic groups require a heavier body in order to be attractive.&lt;ref name="M Rguibi"/&gt;

=== Tunisia ===
In 1997, 27.4% of the population was overweight and 14.4% were obese.&lt;ref name="IASO Adults" /&gt; Obesity rates were twice as high in urban areas than in rural areas.&lt;ref name="Najat Mokhtar"/&gt;

Obesity is culturally seen as a representation of beauty and success. A woman who is of a healthy weight is not as desirable (like in certain other Arabic nations). There is a lack of knowledge about the life-threatening medical conditions that result from obesity.&lt;ref name="Najat Mokhtar"/&gt;

==Government response==

=== Jordan ===
The Jordanian Government released the document National Health Research Priorities 2009–2012, briefly describing health concerns in a variety of areas. The section about [[non-communicable disease]]s and health behavior specifically addressed obesity and its effects. The diseases that were targeted were hyptertension and obesity [[dyslipidemia]]s. Dietary habits, exercise, and alcohol consumption were targeted in the health behavior section. The paper did not elaborate on how these priorities would be addressed or resolved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ministry of Health|title=National Health Research Priorities Jordan 2009 - 2012|url=http://www.moh.gov.jo/MOH/Files/Publication/sehha%20Helth2_1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kuwait ===
The Kuwaiti government has dealt with the prevalence of obesity through a variety of methods, including awareness campaigns through exercise, health forums, and health fairs. In 2007, the Health Ministry supported the [[National Bank of Kuwait]] Walkathon in [[Salmiya]] in an effort to raise awareness of the health problems associated with weight gain and obesity. Over 9,000 people attended. Another individual, Jasem Al-Zeraei, started the Six-K Walking Club with the intention of achieving the same goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Fattahova|first=Nawara|title=Kuwait Steps for Health|url=http://www.kuwaittimes.net/read_news.php?newsid=MzIzNDczMTE2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Mediterranean Diet Fair was held at Kuwait's Dasman Institute for Research, Training, and Prevention of Diabetes &amp; Other Chronic Conditions. Educating the public about how to eat a healthy diet was the purpose of the fair. However, unlike other initiatives, participants were told how to eat well and enjoy food at the same time.&lt;ref name="Velina Nacheva" /&gt;

In 2010, the New Mowasat Hospital hosted a Ramadan health forum. Entitled "Stay Healthy...While Fasting", the audience was lectured on diabetes and obesity and the health benefits of fasting. Four qualified doctors from the New Mowasat Hospital's Cardiology, [[Diabetology]], [[Dietetics]], and Urology Department, presented medical information and advice. They spoke on various topics, including meal management, the role of physical activities, and the types of high fat foods eaten during Ramadan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kuwait Times|title=New Mowasat Hospital Hosts Ramadan Health Forum|url=http://www.kuwaittimes.net/read_news.php?newsid=Njc5Nzc5NzI2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the [[Petroleum industry in Kuwait|Petrochemical Industries Company]] organized several health-care related activities for their employees. One of the main focuses was countering obesity. The entitled "Get Fit" campaign offered free blood tests and nutritional advice and provided lectures given by knowledgeable doctors. The dangers of obesity were also addressed through the distribution of brochures and fitness advice and public posting of awareness posters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Kuwait Times|title=PIC Concludes 'Get Fit' Campaign|url=http://www.kuwaittimes.net/read_news.php?newsid=OTY5NTYxMTI4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Oman ===
The Omani government responded to the health issues related to obesity in its 7th Five-Year Plan for Health Development National Strategic Plan 2006–2010. Acknowledging within the document that the swift to an unhealthy lifestyle is leading to obesity, [[hypertension]], cardiac diseases, and diabetes, strategic objectives and visions were developed.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite web|first=Ministry of Health of Oman|title=The Seventh Five-Year Plan for Health Development: the National Strategies Plan|url=http://www.moh.gov.om/.../HealthResearchPolicyofMinistryofHealth.pdf }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The visions included prevention and control of non-communicable diseases, promotion health awareness of the community and establishing a culture of healthy lifestyle. These goals are to be achieved through a focus on the areas of reducing non-communicable diseases, health education, adolescent and youth health, and nutrition.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

In 2000, 11.6% of the adult population had diabetes and 35.2% of males and 30.9% of females had hypertension. By 2010, the target goal was that only 45% of the population 20 years or older were overweight or obese. Increasing the percentage of people who walked 150 minutes a week to 50% would aid in this goal. Early diagnosis of non-communicable diseases was another strategy to improve the health of the Omani population.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

In order to educate the target goal of 90% of the population on unhealthy practices in nutrition by 2010, a website was to be designed and made available by 2007. Weekly series on health covered by radio, newspapers, and television should be established by 2010, as should 30 substantial health education materials produced on various health topics. Additionally, health institutions and communities in the country should have completed 250,000 health-related activities by 2010. This would aid the government in achieving its goal of increasing the percentage of the population exercising to 40%.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

In order to combat childhood obesity and the medical consequences of it in adulthood, the promotion of healthy lifestyles was designated as the central focus. Three factors were mentioned: eating breakfast, physical activity outside of school, and maintaining positive attitudes towards a healthy lifestyle. By 2010, 70% of 13 through 15 years old should be eating breakfast, 70% should be exercising independently of school requirements, and 50% more youth and families should have positive ideas about healthy lifestyles. All of these factors would result in a lower percentage of overweight youth population.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

Improved nutritional practices were also linked to decreasing obesity by a significant percentage. This is prescribed to occur by the promotion of healthy nutritional practices, such as community activities and informational pamphlets.  By 2010, 60% of the population should have adequate knowledge of beneficial nutritional practices.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt;

=== Saudi Arabia ===
The government is combating the obesity concern with regular coverage of the disease and the other consequences of being of an unhealthy weight in daily newspapers. During [[Ramadan]], it established a program called "Hello Ramadan." It provided health information related to fasting and allowed listeners to call in to learn more about diabetes and [[high blood pressure]]. Listeners could also receive medical information via fax from the program.&lt;ref name="Fitness Sinful" /&gt;

=== United Arab Emirates ===
The United Arab Emirates has launched an intense campaign to address the high rates of obesity. It began its campaign in 2007 and has continued it today. In the summer of 2007, the [[Sanofi-Aventis]] along with the World Health Organization sponsored an event with free health screenings. The purpose was to raise awareness about obesity, its dangers, and its connection to cardiovascular diseases. This was in response to unacceptable results from the International Day for Evaluation of Abdominal Obesity survey, which determined that 37% of adults age 30 plus were obese.&lt;ref name="Gulf Today"&gt;{{cite web|last=Gulf Today|title=Free Health Camps to be Held in Dubai and Abu Dhabi|url=http://www.moh.gov.ae/en/NewsDetails203.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Health also designed a school program for the 2007–2008 year which targeted teenagers and their health. Topics addressed in the year-long awareness and education program included smoking, personal hygiene, physical exercise, and obesity. Exercising and playing sports in order to fight obesity was a key component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khaleej Times|title=Ministry Plans Health Services Package for School Children|url=http://www.moh.gov.ae/en/NewsDetails355.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, the Ministry of Health drafted a set of nutritional guidelines focused on maintaining the current level of non-communicable diseases. The other major goal was to improve the well-being of the entire population. Nutritional education programs were set up in health centers, schools, and women associations to spread awareness of non-communicable diseases and how to prevent them. The development of a better dietary culture in school canteens and hospitals was a second approach. This draft was included as part of the National Nutritional Strategy and Action Plan for 2010–2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ministry of Health|title=New Nutritional Strategy to Take Shape Soon|url=http://www.moh.gov.ae/en/NewsDetails488.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The National Nutrition Committee was also founded at this time with the purpose of creating a national strategy.&lt;ref name="Michael Reid" /&gt;

The National Nutrition Strategy was announced in early 2010. It was designed to ensure that the citizens of the United Arab Emirates would have a healthier future. The Strategy outlined how this goal would be achieved. Early nutritional intervention programs and an emphasis on healthy foods and exercise at home, school, and the workplace was one way listed. By spreading health and nutrition awareness, the prevalence of obesity and non-communicable diseases was being addressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Ministry of Health|title=Executive Committee for Implementation and Follow Up|url=http://www.moh.gov.ae/en/NewsDetails529.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Ministry of Health later announced that a nutritional survey would be completed in December 2010. This would ensure that the nutritional strategy was being implemented properly and effectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Ministry of Health|title=Minister of Health Stresses Continuous Program Follow-Up|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The General Administration of Youth Centers and the Department of Health Education and Promotion sponsored a camp in July 2010 for a select 20 teenagers battling obesity. Every participant was challenged to lose one kilogram a week. A medical check up and relevant tests were conducted at the beginning and end of the session. At the camp, the teenagers were given lectures on healthy food consumption. They also participated in daily sports activities and ate healthy meals and snacks.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|first=Ministry of Health|title=Health Education Participates in "No to Obesity" Program|url=http://www.moh.gov.ae/en/NewsDetails556.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Ministry of Health conducted an awareness campaign at the same time, entitling it "Summer in My Country." This consisted of a series of lectures aimed at teenagers and covered topics such as smoking, obesity, and losing weight.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; The Abu Dhabi Food Control Authority, addressed the rising rates of obesity by banning all junk food from school canteens. This included burgers, [[shawarma]], sugary drinks, and energy drinks. Parents were supportive of the decision, as one in eight children is obese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Detrie|first=Megan|title=Junk Food is Taken Off the School Menu|url=http://www.thenational.ae/news/uae-news/education/junk-food-is-taken-off-the-school-menu}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 8–9, 2010, the Ministry of Health sponsored the International Diabetes Summit in Dubai. The purpose of the conference was to "highlight the rising prevalence of diabetes and its complications in the world in general and the Middle East in particular".&lt;ref name="Diabetes Summit" /&gt; One of the topical focuses was diabetes in the Middle East, especially amongst youth populations. Another summit will take place on February 25–26, 2011.&lt;ref name="Diabetes Summit" /&gt;

=== Iran ===
In 2002, a dietary health intervention program called "the [[Isfahan]] Healthy Heart Programme" was established.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite book|last=Mohammadifard|first=N|title=Effect of a Community-Based Intervention on Nutrition Behaviour in a Developing Country Setting: The Isfahan Healthy Heart Programme|year=2009|displayauthors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is supported by the Iranian Budget and Planning Organization, as well as the Deputy for Health of the Iranian Ministry of Health and Medical Education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Sarrafzadegan|first=Nizal|title=Metabolic Syndrome: An Emerging Public Health Problem in Iranian Women: Isfahan Healthy Heart Program|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intervention took the form of public education through the mass media, marketing, and policy making. After an evaluation in 2006, the results showed that the program was effective in improving dietary behaviors. The population of Isfahan had switched to liquid oil and olive oil, rather than using hydrogenated oil, and consumed more healthy foods.  Fruit, vegetables, fish, and low-fat dairy products were preferred over sausages, animal fat, and sweets. The Fat Consumption Index was lower after the campaign than before it.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3 /&gt;

=== Egypt ===
The Egyptian government produced a Demographic and Health Survey in 2008, covering topics from family planning to maternal health care to nutrition. Chapter 14 was dedicated to nutritional statistics and specifically mentioned obesity. It did not discuss future policy plans to address the rising trend of obesity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Egypt Ministry of Health|title=Egypt Demographic and Health Survey 2008|url=http://www.measuredhs.com/pubs/pdf/FR220/FR220.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''oncology nurse''' is a specialized [[nurse]] who cares for [[cancer]] patients. These nurses require advanced certifications and clinical experiences in oncology further than the typical bachelorette nursing program provides. [[Oncology]] nursing care can defined as meeting the various needs of oncology patients during the time of their disease including appropriate screenings and other preventative practices, symptom management, care to retain as much normal functioning as possible, and supportive measures upon end of life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ferrell|first1=B|last2=Virani|first2=R|last3=Smith|first3=S|last4=Juarez|first4=G|title=The role of oncology nursing to ensure quality care for cancer survivors: a report commissioned by the national cancer policy board and institute of medicine|journal=Oncology Nursing Forum|date=2003|volume=30|pages=E1-E11|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;sid=f9bb7b43-1a76-412f-bea4-cedf7ec6bdc8%40sessionmgr4006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Certification in the United States==
The [[Oncology Nursing Certification Corporation]] (ONCC) offers several different options for [[Nursing board certification|board certification]] in [[oncology | oncological]] nursing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oncc.org/publications/|title=Information for Employers &amp; Advocates|date=29 January 2015|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Certification is a voluntary process and ensures that a nurse has proper qualifications and knowledge of a specialty area and has kept up-to-date in his or her education.

The ONCC offers eight options for certification:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oncc.org/TakeTest/Certifications|title=Oncology Nursing Certifications|date=3 October 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* ''Basic:
** OCN: Oncology Certified Nurse
** CPON: Certified Pediatric Oncology Nurse
** CPHON: Certified Pediatric Hematology Oncology Nurse
* ''Specialty:
** BMTCN: Blood and Marrow Transplant Certified Nurse
** CBCN: Certified Breast Care Nurse
* ''Advanced:''
** AOCN: Advanced Oncology Certified Nurse
** AOCNP: Advanced Oncology Certified Nurse Practitioner
** AOCNS: Advanced Oncology Certified Clinical Nurse Specialist

Certification is granted for four years, after which it must be renewed by taking a recertification test or by earning a certain number of continuing education credits.

To become certified, nurses must have an [[Registered nurse|RN]] license, meet specific eligibility criteria for nursing experience and specialty practice, and must pass a multiple-choice test.

For the advanced AOCNP and AOCNS certifications, a nurse must have a [[master's degree]] or higher in nursing and a minimum of 500 hours of supervised clinical practice of oncology [[nursing]].  The AOCNP certification also requires successful completion of an accredited [[nurse practitioner]] program.

== Oncology Nursing in Morocco ==

=== Demand ===
The demand for oncology nurses is enormous in Morocco. Statistics of the Moroccan Ministry of Health indicate that the death toll of malignant neoplasms mounts to 17 thousands a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ministère de la santé|title=Etat de s anté population marocaine 2012|url=http://srvweb.sante.gov.ma:83/DocumentsConf/Rapport%20Etat%20de%20sante.pdf|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The number of patients with cancer is believed to be three-times the number of annual deaths. A recent study of the European Institute of Health Sciences (Institut Européen des Sciences de la Santé) projected that the need for oncology nurses in 2025 is estimated at 5 thousand nurses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Institut Européen des Sciences de la Santé|title=Infirmier en Oncologie|url=http://iessmaroc.com/oncologie.html|website=IESS Maroc|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yet, the number of qualified oncology nurses in the country is equal to nil. The reason is obviously the absence of a formal educational program in oncology nursing.

===Oncology nursing training in Morocco===
Currently there currently exists only one educational program in oncology nursing that is being offered by the European Institute of Health Sciences. It has been approved by the Ministry of Higher Education as well as the Ministry of Health in 2014. The duration of this Bachelor of Science program in Oncology Nursing is 3 years and encompasses a total of 6 thousands hours, equivalent to 120 semester credits in the US educational system and 180 ECTS in the European system. The program attracts a large number of students from African countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Institut Européen des Sciences de la Santé|title=Licence en Sciences Infirmières - Soins Oncologiques|url=http://iessmaroc.com/oncologie.html|website=IESS Maroc|accessdate=1 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Certification requirements in Morocco===
In Morocco, there exists no system for certification of oncology nurses. However, graduates of the oncology nursing program of the European Institute of Health Sciences can set for certification exams abroad, particularly in European countries.

==Roles==

Oncology nurses, like any Registered [[Nurse]] have a large variety of settings they can work in. Oncology nurses can work inpatient settings such as hospitals, outpatient settings, in hospice services, or in physician offices. There are a variety of specialties such as [[radiation]], surgery, pediatric, or gynecologic. Oncology nurses have advanced knowledge of assessing the client’s status and from this assessment will help the multi-disciplinary medical team to develop a treatment plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Statement on the scope and standards of oncology nursing practice|journal=American Nurses Association and the Oncology Nursing Society|date=1996|url=http://web.a.ebscohost.com/ehost/pdfviewer/pdfviewer?vid=2&amp;sid=f9bb7b43-1a76-412f-bea4-cedf7ec6bdc8%40sessionmgr4006|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education===

The nurse must also educate the patient on their condition, its side effects, its treatment plan, and how to prevent possible complications. This education should be done effectively throughout the treatment of the disease, according to the teaching style that best suits the particular patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Padberg|first1=R.M.|last2=Padberg|first2=L.F.|title=Patient education and support|journal=Cancer nursing: principles and practice|volume=5|page=1609-1631|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK13570/}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Oncology Nursing Standards, the patient or caregivers for the patient should understand the state of the disease and the therapy used at their education level, understand the therapy schedule and when it is being used, be involved in decisions regarding their own care, and state interventions for serious side effects and complications of the disease and intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Oncology Nursing Society|title=Statement on the scope and standards of advanced practice in oncology nursing|date=1997|publisher=Oncology Nursing Press|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK13337/#A17973}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Treatment===

Nurses must be able to manage the many side effects associated with cancer and the treatment. Nurses must have extensive knowledge of pharmacological and nonpharmacological nursing interventions, and when they are appropriate to use. &lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rieger|first1=P.T.|last2=Yarbro|first2=C.H.|title=Role of the Oncology Nurse|journal=Holland-Frei Cancer Medicine|date=2003|volume=6|url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK13570/|accessdate=3 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Chemotherapy===

Oncology nurses must have appropriate training in the administration, handling, side effects, and dosing of chemotherapy. Each institution will have its own policies for various chemotherapy drugs to ensure adequate training and for prevention of errors. &lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; The Oncology Nursing Society (ONS) and Oncology Nursing Certification Corporation (ONCC) offer a Chemotherapy/Biotherapy training course available to any oncology nurse to ensure the safe administration and management of side effects of chemotherapy and biotherapy agents. This course consists of 16 contact hours. This certification needs to be renewed after two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ONS/ONCC Chemotherapy Biotherapy Certificate Course |url=https://www.ons.org/content/onsoncc-chemotherapy-biotherapy-certificate-course}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Penske workplace shootings''' occurred on January 12, 2010. Three people were killed and two others critically injured in a workplace shooting at a truck rental business located near the city of [[Kennesaw, Georgia]]. The fourth victim later died in 2013 from complications of his injuries. The alleged shooter, Jesse J. Warren, was captured and arrested in the incident.

==Shooting==
The shooter, Jesse James Warren, a former employee, walked into the [[Penske Corporation|Penske]] truck rental business Tuesday afternoon wearing [[camouflage]]. He opened fire, shooting five. Four victims were employees, another was a customer. One victim, Van Springer, died at the scene. The other four victims were transported in critical condition to a local hospital. A customer died at the hospital, while Roberto Gonzalez, an employee, died the next day, which brought the death toll to three.

'''Peyronie's disease''' is a [[connective tissue disorder]] involving the growth of fibrous plaques in the [[soft tissue]] of the [[Human penis|penis]]. Specifically, scar tissue forms in the [[Tunica albuginea (penis)|tunica albuginea]], the thick sheath of tissue surrounding the [[Corpus cavernosum penis|corpora cavernosa]], causing pain, abnormal curvature, erectile dysfunction, indentation, loss of girth and shortening.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Levine |first1=Laurence A |year=2010 |title=Peyronie's disease and erectile dysfunction: Current understanding and future direction |journal=Indian Journal of Urology |volume=22 |issue=3 |pages=246–50 |doi=10.4103/0970-1591.27633}}&lt;/ref&gt; A variety of treatments have been used, but few have been especially effective.

&lt;!-- Epidemiology --&gt;
It is estimated to affect about 10% of men.&lt;ref name=NIH2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Penile Curvature (Peyronie's Disease)|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/urologic-diseases/penile-curvature-peyronies-disease|website=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|accessdate=25 October 2017|date=July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The condition becomes more common with age.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Peyronie's disease.jpg|thumb|Example of penis deformation from side.]]
A certain degree of curvature of the penis is considered normal, as many men are born with this benign condition, commonly referred to as congenital curvature.

The disease may cause pain; hardened, big, cord-like [[lesion]]s (scar tissue known as "plaques"); or abnormal curvature of the penis when erect due to chronic inflammation of the [[tunica albuginea (penis)|tunica albuginea]] (CITA).{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} Although the popular conception of Peyronie's disease is that it always involves curvature of the penis, the scar tissue sometimes causes divots or indentations rather than curvature. The condition may also make [[sexual intercourse]] painful and/or difficult, though it is unclear whether some men report satisfactory or unsatisfactory intercourse in spite of the disorder.{{Citation needed|date=January 2010}} It can affect men of any race and age. The disorder is confined to the penis, although a substantial number of men with Peyronie's exhibit concurrent [[connective tissue disorders]] in the hand, and to a lesser degree, in the feet. About 30 percent of men with Peyronie's disease develop [[fibrosis]] in other elastic tissues of the body, such as on the hand or foot, including [[Dupuytren's contracture]] of the hand. An increased incidence in genetically related males suggests a genetic component.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Carrieri MP, Serraino D, Palmiotto F, Nucci G, Sasso F |title=A case-control study on risk factors for Peyronie's disease |journal=Journal of Clinical Epidemiology |volume=51 |issue=6 |pages=511–5 |date=June 1998  |pmid=9636000 |doi=10.1016/S0895-4356(98)00015-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Causes==
The underlying cause of Peyronie's disease is not well understood. The most common cause is a buildup of plaque inside the penis&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.proextenderindia.com/peyronies/|title=Peyronies (Bent Penis) - ProExtender Penis Enlargement Device|work=ProExtender Penis Enlargement Device|access-date=2018-11-12|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It could be by trauma or injury to the penis usually through sexual intercourse or physical activity, although many patients are often unaware of any traumatic event or injury.{{mcn|date=September 2018}}

==Diagnosis==
[[File:Peyronie's Disease Ultrasound.jpg|thumb|This ultrasound depicts cross sections of the penis at different locations in a patient with Peyronie's disease.  The top image shows normal anatomy whereas the bottom image shows scar tissue on the [[tunica albuginea (penis)]]. The scar tissue is localized and responsible for the hallmark deformities of Peyronie's disease (curvature and narrowing).]]
A urologist may be able to diagnose the disease and suggest treatment. An ultrasound can provide conclusive evidence of Peyronie's disease, ruling out congenital curvature or other disorders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Amin Z, Patel U, Friedman EP, Vale JA, Kirby R, Lees WR |title=Colour Doppler and duplex ultrasound assessment of Peyronie's disease in impotent men |journal=The British Journal of Radiology |volume=66 |issue=785 |pages=398–402 |date=May 1993  |pmid=8319059 |doi=10.1259/0007-1285-66-785-398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Treatment==

===Medication and supplements===
[[Collagenase clostridium histolyticum]] (Auxilium), a drug originally approved by the FDA to treat [[Dupuytren's contracture]], is now an FDA-approved injectable drug for treatment of Peyronie's disease. The drug is reported to work by breaking down the excess collagen in the penis that causes Peyronie's disease.

===Surgery===
Surgery, such as the "Nesbit operation" (which is named after [[Reed M. Nesbit]] (1898–1979), an [[American people|American]] [[urologist]] at [[University of Michigan]]),&lt;ref name="pmid14690485"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Ralph DJ, Minhas S |title=The management of Peyronie's disease |journal=BJU International |volume=93 |issue=2 |pages=208–15 |date=January 2004 |pmid=14690485 |doi=10.1111/j.1464-410X.2004.04587.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered a last resort and should only be performed by highly skilled urological surgeons knowledgeable in specialized corrective surgical techniques. A [[penile prosthesis]] may be appropriate in advanced cases.&lt;ref name="pmid14551588"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Hellstrom WJ, Usta MF |title=Surgical approaches for advanced Peyronie's disease patients |journal=International Journal of Impotence Research |volume=15 |issue=Suppl 5 |pages=S121–4 |date=October 2003 |pmid=14551588 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijir.3901085}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical therapy and devices===
There is moderate evidence that penile traction therapy is a well-tolerated, minimally invasive treatment, but there is uncertainty about the optimal duration of stretching per day and per course of treatment, and the treatment course is difficult.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Eric C, Geralb B |title=Penile traction therapy and Peyronie's disease: a state of art review of the current literature |journal=Ther Adv Urol. |date=February 2013 |pages=59–65 |volume=5 |issue=2 |doi=10.1177/1756287212454932|pmc=3547530 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Counseling===
Peyronie's disease can be a physically and psychologically devastating disease. While most men will continue to be able to have sexual relations, they are likely to experience some degree of deformity and [[erectile dysfunction]] in the wake of the disease process. It is not uncommon for men afflicted with Peyronie's disease to exhibit depression or withdrawal from their sexual partners.&lt;ref name="pmid23153101"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Nelson CJ, Mulhall JP |title=Psychological impact of Peyronie's disease: a review |journal=The Journal of Sexual Medicine |volume=10 |issue=3 |pages=653–60 |date=March 2013  |pmid=23153101 |doi=10.1111/j.1743-6109.2012.02999.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The condition is named for [[François Gigot de La Peyronie]], who described it in 1743; the condition may have been described around 100 years before that.&lt;ref&gt;{{WhoNamedIt|synd|3345|Peyronie's disease}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the US FDA approved the first drug specifically for Peyronie's; the drug was [[collagenase clostridium histolyticum]] (Auxilium).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=FDA approves first drug treatment for Peyronie’s disease|url=http://www.fda.gov/newsevents/newsroom/pressannouncements/ucm377849.htm|work=FDA NEWS RELEASE|publisher=U.S. Food and Drug Administration|accessdate=6 December 2013|date=6 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/12/07/business/fda-approves-treatment-for-curved-penis.html |last=Pollack |first=Andrew |title=Injections to Treat an Embarrassing Ailment Win U.S. Approval |work=New York Times |date=December 6, 2013 |accessdate=December 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
[[Vitamin E]] supplementation has been studied for decades, and some success has been reported in older trials, but those successes have not been reliably repeated in larger, newer studies.&lt;ref name="pmid12454684"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Mynderse LA, Monga M |title=Oral therapy for Peyronie's disease |journal=International Journal of Impotence Research |volume=14 |issue=5 |pages=340–4 |date=October 2002 |pmid=12454684 |doi=10.1038/sj.ijir.3900869}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[Interferon-alpha-2b]] in the early stages of the disease has been studied, but as of 2007 its efficacy was questionable.&lt;ref name="pmid17352513"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Trost LW, Gur S, Hellstrom WJ |title=Pharmacological Management of Peyronie's Disease |journal=Drugs |volume=67 |issue=4 |pages=527–45 |year=2007 |pmid=17352513 |doi=10.2165/00003495-200767040-00004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5461">'''Pharmacy practice research''', also known as '''pharmacy research''', is a specialty field within the wider area of [[health services research]], which focuses on examining how and why people access [[pharmacy]] services, how much care costs, and what happens to patients as a result of this care. Its aim is to support [[evidence-based policy]] and practice decisions where [[pharmacist]]s are employed or [[medicines]] are prescribed or used.&lt;ref&gt;Sheri L Koshman, [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC3093426/ What is Pharmacy Research?] ''Can J Hosp Pharmv.'' 64(2); Mar-Apr 2011. Accessed 29 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Canadian Pharmacists Association, [http://www.pharmacists.ca/index.cfm/education-practice-resources/pharmacy-practice-research/ Pharmacy practice research.] Accessed 28 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Health Services Research and Pharmacy Practice Group, [http://www.hsrpp.org.uk/index.html University of Aberdeen HSRPP Conference.] Accessed 28 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Goals==
[[File:Legenogapotekeren.jpg|thumb|Illustration of a doctor and pharmacist from ''Medicinarius'' (1505) by [[Hieronymus Brunschwig]].]]
The goals of pharmacy practice research are to support the clinical and effective use of [[medicines]], while ensuring that the risks of [[adverse drug reaction]]s are minimised. It is generally concerned with the delivery of and equitable access to [[pharmaceutical care]] and other services delivered by pharmacists and related [[health care provider]]s. It is undertaken by researchers, often based in universities, from a wide range of health care disciplines. These may include [[multidisciplinary]] groups of pharmacists together with [[statistician]]s, physicians, nurses, health psychologists, [[social scientists]], [[health economists]] and [[epidemiologists]], among others.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Areas of pharmacy research may include, for example:&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/medicines/areas/en/ Medicines: Areas of work.] Accessed 30 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Medicines policy and governance
*Quality assurance and safety
*Medicine access and rational use
*Quality, safety &amp; standards (e.g. vaccines and biologicals).

==Approaches==
The approaches taken in pharmacy research can be summarised under the broad areas of understanding and describing the way care is accessed and delivered, identifying areas for improvement and evaluating new service models using rigorous research approaches.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}

Pharmacy practice research often challenges traditional [[professional boundaries]], reflecting the shift in the balance of care currently observed in health care delivery.{{citation needed|date=April 2014}}  For example, many conditions that were once primarily managed solely in a hospital setting are now managed in [[primary care]] settings, and many roles particularly delivered by doctors are now being delivered by other health care professionals including pharmacists. Pharmacy research aims to understand the clinical, humanistic and economic impact of these changes from the perspectives of pharmacists, patients and other health care professionals.

Findings from pharmacy practice research have supported [[health policy]] changes affecting pharmacy. In some instances they have been the driver for a new service to be delivered through pharmacy, such as smoking cessation or repeat dispensing.&lt;ref&gt;Sinclair, H.K., Bond, C.M, Stead. L.F. "Community pharmacy personnel interventions for smoking cessation." ''The Cochrane Library'' 2004 Issue 1&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bond, C.M. , Matheson, C., Williams, S., Williams, P. "Repeat Prescribing: An evaluation of the role of community pharmacists in controlling and monitoring repeat prescribing." ''British Journal of General Practice''; 2000:50;271-5&lt;/ref&gt; In other instances they have provided evidence to underpin a policy change (e.g. pharmacist prescribing) or to evaluate a newly implemented initiative and make recommendations for continuation or change of the service (e.g. new Community Pharmacy Contractual Framework,&lt;ref&gt;Blenkinsopp A, Bond C.M Celino G, and Inch J. "The implications of the new Community Pharmacy Contractual Framework (CPCF) for the community pharmacy workforce." October 2008 RPSGB-PPRT&lt;/ref&gt; Medicine Use Reviews,&lt;ref&gt;NHS Networks, [http://www.networks.nhs.uk/nhs-networks/south-east-coast-respiratory-programme/news/formal-evaluation-of-the-inhaler-technique-improvement-project/?searchterm=evaluation%20of%20inhaler%20technique%20improvement Formal evaluation of the Inhaler Technique Improvement Project], accessed 12-12-12&lt;/ref&gt; or New Medicines Service&lt;ref&gt;UK Clinical Research Network, [http://public.ukcrn.org.uk/search/StudyDetail.aspx?StudyID=12494 Evaluation of the New Medicine Service] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140429204409/http://public.ukcrn.org.uk/search/StudyDetail.aspx?StudyID=12494 |date=2014-04-29 }}, accessed 12-12-12&lt;/ref&gt;).

[[File:Symptoms of pneumonia.svg|thumb|left|upright=1.3|alt=A diagram of the human body outlining the key symptoms of pneumonia|Main symptoms of infectious pneumonia]]
People with infectious pneumonia often have a [[cough|productive cough]], [[fever]] accompanied by [[rigors|shaking chills]], [[shortness of breath]], sharp or stabbing [[chest pain]] during deep breaths, and an increased [[respiratory rate|rate of breathing]].&lt;ref name=BMJ06/&gt; In elderly people, confusion may be the most prominent sign.&lt;ref name=BMJ06&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hoare Z, Lim WS | title = Pneumonia: update on diagnosis and management | journal = BMJ | volume = 332 | issue = 7549 | pages = 1077–9 | date = May 2006 | pmid = 16675815 | pmc = 1458569 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.332.7549.1077 | url = http://www.bmj.com/content/332/7549/1077.full.pdf | format = PDF }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The typical signs and symptoms in children under five are fever, cough, and fast or difficult breathing.&lt;ref name=Develop11/&gt; Fever is not very specific, as it occurs in many other common illnesses and may be absent in those with severe disease, [[malnutrition]] or in the elderly. In addition, a cough is frequently absent in children less than 2 months old.&lt;ref name=Develop11/&gt; More severe signs and symptoms in children may include [[central cyanosis|blue-tinged skin]], unwillingness to drink, convulsions, ongoing vomiting, extremes of temperature, or a [[decreased level of consciousness]].&lt;ref name=Develop11/&gt;&lt;ref name=Clinic2011/&gt;

Bacterial and viral cases of pneumonia are usually present with similar symptoms.&lt;ref name=WHOPrevent2012/&gt; Some causes are associated with classic, but non-specific, clinical characteristics. Pneumonia caused by ''[[Legionella]]'' may occur with abdominal pain, [[diarrhea]], or confusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Darby J, Buising K | title = Could it be Legionella? | journal = Australian Family Physician | volume = 37 | issue = 10 | pages = 812–5 | date = October 2008 | pmid = 19002299 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pneumonia caused by ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' is associated with rusty colored sputum.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ortqvist A, Hedlund J, Kalin M | title = Streptococcus pneumoniae: epidemiology, risk factors, and clinical features | journal = Seminars in Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine | volume = 26 | issue = 6 | pages = 563–74 | date = December 2005 | pmid = 16388428 | doi = 10.1055/s-2005-925523 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pneumonia caused by ''[[Klebsiella]]'' may have bloody sputum often described as "currant jelly".&lt;ref name=Tint10&gt;{{cite book |author=Tintinalli, Judith E. |title=Emergency Medicine: A Comprehensive Study Guide (Emergency Medicine (Tintinalli))|publisher=McGraw-Hill Companies |location=New York|year=2010|pages=480 |isbn=0-07-148480-9 |oclc= |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Bloody sputum (known as [[hemoptysis]]) may also occur with [[tuberculosis]], Gram-negative pneumonia, [[lung abscess]]es and more commonly [[acute bronchitis]].&lt;ref name=Clinic2011/&gt; Pneumonia caused by ''[[Mycoplasma pneumoniae]]'' may occur in association with [[cervical lymphadenopathy|swelling of the lymph nodes in the neck]], [[arthralgia|joint pain]], or a [[otitis media|middle ear infection]].&lt;ref name=Clinic2011/&gt; Viral pneumonia presents more commonly with [[wheezing]] than bacterial pneumonia.&lt;ref name=WHOPrevent2012/&gt; Pneumonia was historically divided into "typical" and "atypical" based on the belief that the presentation predicted the underlying cause.&lt;ref name=M32/&gt; However, evidence has not supported this distinction, therefore it is no longer emphasized.&lt;ref name=M32/&gt;

==Cause==
[[File:Streptococcus pneumoniae.jpg|thumb|alt=Three one round objects in a black background|The bacterium ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'', a common cause of pneumonia, imaged by an [[electron microscope]]]]
Pneumonia is due to infections caused primarily by [[bacteria]] or [[virus]]es and less commonly by [[fungi]] and [[parasites]]. Although there are over 100 strains of infectious agents identified, only a few are responsible for the majority of the cases. Mixed infections with both viruses and bacteria may occur in roughly 45% of infections in children and 15% of infections in adults.&lt;ref name=Lancet11/&gt; A causative agent may not be isolated in approximately half of cases despite careful testing.&lt;ref name=EBMED05/&gt;

The term ''pneumonia'' is sometimes more broadly applied to any condition resulting in [[inflammation]] of the lungs (caused for example by [[autoimmune disease]]s, chemical burns or drug reactions); however, this inflammation is more accurately referred to as [[pneumonitis]].&lt;ref name="isbn0-7234-3200-7"&gt;{{cite book | vauthors = Lowe JF, Stevens A | title = Pathology |edition=2nd |publisher=Mosby |location=St. Louis |year=2000 |page=197 |isbn=978-0-7234-3200-5 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=AfVxLi4QTZQC&amp;pg=PA197}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Bowden|editor-first1=Raleigh A.|editor-last2=Ljungman|editor-first2=Per|editor-last3=Snydman|editor-first3=David R.|title=Transplant infections|year=2010|publisher=Wolters Kluwer Health/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-1-58255-820-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacteria===
{{Main|Bacterial pneumonia}}
[[File:MRSAPneumoCT.png|thumb|Cavitating pneumonia as seen on CT. Pneumonia due to MRSA.]]

The spreading of organisms is facilitated when risk factors are present.&lt;ref name=EBMED05/&gt; [[Alcoholism]] is associated with ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'', [[anaerobic organism]]s, and ''Mycobacterium tuberculosis''; smoking facilitates the effects of ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'', ''Haemophilus influenzae'', ''Moraxella catarrhalis'', and ''Legionella pneumophila''. Exposure to birds is associated with ''[[Chlamydia psittaci]]''; farm animals with ''[[Coxiella burnetti]]''; aspiration of stomach contents with anaerobic organisms; and [[cystic fibrosis]] with ''[[Pseudomonas aeruginosa]]'' and ''Staphylococcus aureus''.&lt;ref name=EBMED05/&gt; ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' is more common in the winter,&lt;ref name=EBMED05/&gt; and it should be suspected in persons aspirating a large amount of anaerobic organisms.&lt;ref name=Clinic2011/&gt;

===Viruses===

Pneumonia frequently starts as an [[upper respiratory tract infection]] that moves into the lower respiratory tract.&lt;ref name=PedNA09&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Ranganathan SC, Sonnappa S | title = Pneumonia and other respiratory infections | journal = Pediatric Clinics of North America | volume = 56 | issue = 1 | pages = 135–56, xi | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19135585 | doi = 10.1016/j.pcl.2008.10.005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a type of [[pneumonitis]] (lung inflammation).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Anderson|first1=Douglas M.|title=Dorland's illustrated medical dictionary|date=2000|publisher=Saunders|location=Philadelphia [u.a.]|isbn=0721682618|page=1414|edition=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The normal flora of the upper airway gives protection by competing with pathogens for nutrients. In the lower airways, reflexes of the [[glottis]], actions of [[complement protein]]s and [[immunoglobulin]]s are important for protection. Micro[[Pulmonary aspiration|aspiration]] of contaminated secretions can infect the lower airways and cause pneumonia. The virulence of the organism, amount of the organisms to start an infection and body immune response against the infection all determines the progress of pneumonia.&lt;ref name="Elena 2015"/&gt;

===Viral===
Viruses may reach the lung by a number of different routes. Respiratory syncytial virus is typically contracted when people touch contaminated objects and then they touch their eyes or nose.&lt;ref name=M31&gt;Murray and Nadel (2010). Chapter 31.&lt;/ref&gt; Other viral infections occur when contaminated airborne droplets are inhaled through the mouth or nose.&lt;ref name=Clinic2011/&gt; Once in the upper airway, the viruses may make their way in the lungs, where they invade the cells lining the airways, alveoli, or [[lung parenchyma]].&lt;ref name=M31/&gt; Some viruses such as measles and herpes simplex may reach the lungs via the blood.&lt;ref name=Gary2010&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Fleisher|editor-first1=Gary R.|editor-last2=Ludwig|editor-first2=Stephen|title=Textbook of pediatric emergency medicine|year=2010|publisher=Wolters Kluwer/Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins Health|location=Philadelphia|isbn=1605471593|pages=914|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a7CqcE1ZrFkC&amp;pg=PA914|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invasion of the lungs may lead to varying degrees of cell death.&lt;ref name=M31/&gt; When the immune system responds to the infection, even more lung damage may occur.&lt;ref name=M31/&gt; Primarily [[white blood cell]]s, mainly [[mononuclear cell]]s, generate the inflammation.&lt;ref name=Gary2010/&gt; As well as damaging the lungs, many viruses simultaneously affect other [[organ (anatomy)|organ]]s and thus disrupt other body functions. Viruses also make the body more susceptible to bacterial infections; in this way, bacterial pneumonia can occur at the same time as viral pneumonia.&lt;ref name=Viral09&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Figueiredo LT | title = Viral pneumonia: epidemiological, clinical, pathophysiological and therapeutic aspects | journal = Jornal Brasileiro De Pneumologia | volume = 35 | issue = 9 | pages = 899–906 | date = September 2009 | pmid = 19820817 | doi = 10.1590/S1806-37132009000900012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bacterial===
Most bacteria enter the lungs via small [[Pulmonary aspiration|aspirations]] of organisms residing in the throat or nose.&lt;ref name=Clinic2011/&gt; Half of normal people have these small aspirations during sleep.&lt;ref name=M32/&gt; While the throat always contains bacteria, [[virulent|potentially infectious]] ones reside there only at certain times and under certain conditions.&lt;ref name=M32/&gt; A minority of types of bacteria such as ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' and ''[[Legionella pneumophila]]'' reach the lungs via contaminated airborne droplets.&lt;ref name=Clinic2011/&gt; Bacteria can spread also via the blood.&lt;ref name=WHOPrevent2012/&gt; Once in the lungs, bacteria may invade the spaces between cells and between alveoli, where the [[macrophage]]s and [[neutrophil]]s (defensive [[white blood cell]]s) attempt to inactivate the bacteria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Hammer|editor-first1=Gary D.|editor-last2=McPhee|editor-first2=Stephen J.|title=Pathophysiology of disease : an introduction to clinical medicine|year=2010|publisher=McGraw-Hill Medical|location=New York|isbn=0071621679|pages=Chapter 4|edition=6th}}&lt;/ref&gt; The neutrophils also release [[cytokine]]s, causing a general activation of the immune system.&lt;ref name=Fein2006&gt;{{cite book|last=Fein|first=Alan|title=Diagnosis and management of pneumonia and other respiratory infections|year=2006|publisher=Professional Communications|location=Caddo, OK|isbn=1884735630|pages=28–29|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hKdcHK719qgC&amp;pg=PA28|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt; This leads to the fever, chills, and fatigue common in bacterial pneumonia.&lt;ref name=Fein2006/&gt; The neutrophils, bacteria, and fluid from surrounding blood vessels fill the alveoli, resulting in the consolidation seen on chest X-ray.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kumar|first=Vinay|title=Robbins and Cotran pathologic basis of disease.|year=2010|publisher=Saunders/Elsevier|location=Philadelphia, PA|isbn=1416031219|pages=Chapter 15|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physical exam===
[[Physical examination]] may sometimes reveal [[hypotension|low blood pressure]], [[tachycardia|high heart rate]], or low [[Oxygenation (medical)|oxygen saturation]].&lt;ref name=Clinic2011/&gt; The respiratory rate may be faster than normal, and this may occur a day or two before other signs.&lt;ref name=Clinic2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=M32/&gt; Examination of the chest may be normal, but it may show decreased chest expansion on the affected side.

===Microbiology===
In patients managed in the community, determining the causative agent is not cost-effective and typically does not alter management.&lt;ref name=Develop11/&gt; For people who do not respond to treatment, [[sputum culture]] should be considered, and culture for ''[[Mycobacterium tuberculosis]]'' should be carried out in persons with a chronic productive cough.&lt;ref name=BTS09/&gt; Microbiological evaluation is also indicated in severe pneumonia, alcoholism, [[asplenia]], immunosuppression, HIV infection, and alcohol abuse.&lt;ref name="Elena 2015"/&gt; Although positive [[blood culture]] and [[pleural fluid]] culture definitively establish the diagnosis of the type of micro-organism involved, a positive sputum culture has to be interpreted with care for the possibility of [[colonisation (biology)|colonisation]] of respiratory tract.&lt;ref name="Elena 2015"/&gt; Testing for other specific organisms may be recommended during outbreaks, for public health reasons.&lt;ref name=BTS09/&gt; In those hospitalized for severe disease, both sputum and [[blood cultures]] are recommended,&lt;ref name=BTS09/&gt; as well as testing the urine for [[antigen]]s to ''Legionella'' and ''Streptococcus''.&lt;ref name=IDSA2007/&gt; Viral infections, can be confirmed via detection of either the virus or its antigens with [[Viral culture|culture]] or [[polymerase chain reaction]] (PCR), among other techniques.&lt;ref name=Lancet11/&gt; ''Mycoplasma'', ''Legionella'', ''Streptococcus'', and ''Chlamydia'' can also be detected using PCR techniques on [[bronchoalveolar lavage]] and [[nasopharyngeal swab]].&lt;ref name="Elena 2015"/&gt; The causative agent is determined in only 15% of cases with routine microbiological tests.&lt;ref name=BMJ06/&gt;

===Classification===
{{Main|Classification of pneumonia}}
[[Pneumonitis]] refers to lung [[inflammation]]; pneumonia refers to pneumonitis, usually due to infection but sometimes non-infectious, that has the additional feature of [[pulmonary consolidation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Stedman's medical dictionary.|year=2006|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|location=Philadelphia|isbn=978-0-7817-6450-6|edition=28th}}&lt;/ref&gt; Pneumonia is most commonly classified by where or how it was acquired: [[Community-acquired pneumonia|community-acquired]], [[aspiration pneumonia|aspiration]], [[healthcare-associated pneumonia|healthcare-associated]], [[hospital-acquired pneumonia|hospital-acquired]], and [[ventilator-associated pneumonia]].&lt;ref name=Rad07&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Sharma S, Maycher B, Eschun G | title = Radiological imaging in pneumonia: recent innovations | journal = Current Opinion in Pulmonary Medicine | volume = 13 | issue = 3 | pages = 159–69 | date = May 2007 | pmid = 17414122 | doi = 10.1097/MCP.0b013e3280f3bff4 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be classified by the area of lung affected: [[lobar pneumonia]], [[bronchial pneumonia]] and [[acute interstitial pneumonia]];&lt;ref name=Rad07/&gt; or by the causative organism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Dunn L | title = Pneumonia: classification, diagnosis and nursing management | journal = Nursing Standard | volume = 19 | issue = 42 | pages = 50–4 | date = June 29 – July 5, 2005 | pmid = 16013205 | doi = 10.7748/ns2005.06.19.42.50.c3901 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pneumonia in children may additionally be classified based on signs and symptoms as non-severe, severe, or very severe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=organization|first=World health|title=Pocket book of hospital care for children : guidelines for the management of common illnesses with limited resources.|year=2005|publisher=World Health Organization|location=Geneva|isbn=978-92-4-154670-6|page=72|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xbkbRG5XYxsC&amp;pg=PA72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The setting in which pneumonia develops is important to treatment,&lt;ref name=Ana2009&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Anand N, Kollef MH | title = The alphabet soup of pneumonia: CAP, HAP, HCAP, NHAP, and VAP | journal = Seminars in Respiratory and Critical Care Medicine | volume = 30 | issue = 1 | pages = 3–9 | date = February 2009 | pmid = 19199181 | doi = 10.1055/s-0028-1119803 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ATS2005/&gt; as it correlates to which pathogens are likely suspects,&lt;ref name=Ana2009/&gt; which mechanisms are likely, which antibiotics are likely to work or fail,&lt;ref name=Ana2009/&gt; and which complications can be expected based on the person's health status.

====Community====
{{Main|Community-acquired pneumonia}}
Community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) is acquired in the community,&lt;ref name=Ana2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=ATS2005/&gt; outside of health care facilities. Compared with health care–associated pneumonia, it is less likely to involve [[multiple drug resistance|multidrug-resistant]] bacteria. Although the latter are no longer rare in CAP,&lt;ref name=Ana2009/&gt; they are still less likely.

====Healthcare====
Health care–associated pneumonia (HCAP) is an infection associated with recent exposure to the [[health care]] system,&lt;ref name=Ana2009/&gt; including hospital, outpatient clinic, [[nursing home]], [[dialysis]] center, [[chemotherapy]] treatment, or [[home care]].&lt;ref name=ATS2005/&gt; HCAP is sometimes called MCAP (medical care–associated pneumonia).

=====Hospital=====
Hospital-acquired pneumonia is acquired in a [[hospital]], specifically, pneumonia that occurs 48 hours or more after admission, which was not incubating at the time of admission.&lt;ref name=ATS2005&gt;{{cite journal |last=American Thoracic Society |last2=Infectious Diseases Society of America |year=2005 |title=Guidelines for the management of adults with hospital-acquired, ventilator-associated, and healthcare-associated pneumonia |journal=Am J Respir Crit Care Med  |volume=171 |issue=4 |pages=388–416 |pmid=15699079 |doi=10.1164/rccm.200405-644ST |postscript=.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Ana2009/&gt; It is likely to involve [[hospital-acquired infection]]s, with higher risk of [[multidrug-resistant]] pathogens. Also, because hospital patients are often ill (which is why they are present in the hospital), accompanying disorders are an issue.

=====Ventilator=====
[[Ventilator-associated pneumonia]] occurs in people breathing with the help of [[mechanical ventilation]].&lt;ref name=Ana2009/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ar2016/&gt; Ventilator-associated pneumonia is specifically defined as pneumonia that arises more than 48 to 72 hours after [[endotracheal intubation]].&lt;ref name=ATS2005/&gt;

===Differential diagnosis===
Several diseases can present with similar signs and symptoms to pneumonia, such as: [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD), [[asthma]], [[pulmonary edema]], [[bronchiectasis]], [[lung cancer]], and [[pulmonary emboli]].&lt;ref name=BMJ06/&gt; Unlike pneumonia, asthma and COPD typically present with [[wheezing]], pulmonary edema presents with an abnormal [[electrocardiogram]], cancer and bronchiectasis present with a cough of longer duration, and pulmonary emboli presents with acute onset sharp chest pain and [[shortness of breath]].&lt;ref name=BMJ06/&gt; Mild pneumonia should be differentiated from [[upper respiratory tract infection]] (URTI). Severe pneumonia should be differentiated from [[acute heart failure]]. Pulmonary infiltrates that resolved after giving [[mechanical ventilation]] should point to heart failure and [[atelectasis]] rather than pneumonia. For recurrent pneumonia, underlying lung cancer, [[metastasis]], [[tuberculosis]], foreign body, immunosuppression, and hypersensitivity should be sought after.&lt;ref name="Elena 2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Elena|first1=Prina|last2=Otavio|first2=T Ranzani|last3=Anthoni|first3=Torres|title=Community-acquired pneumonia|journal=The Lancet|date=12 August 2015|volume=386|issue=9998|pages=1097–1108|doi=10.1016/S0140-6736(15)60733-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Prevention==
Prevention includes [[vaccination]], environmental measures and appropriate treatment of other health problems.&lt;ref name=Develop11/&gt; It is believed that, if appropriate preventive measures were instituted globally, mortality among children could be reduced by 400,000; and, if proper treatment were universally available, childhood deaths could be decreased by another 600,000.&lt;ref name=WHOPrevent2012/&gt;

Complications may occur in particular in the elderly and those with underlying health problems.&lt;ref name=C6/&gt; This may include, among others: [[empyema]], [[lung abscess]], [[bronchiolitis obliterans]], [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]], [[sepsis]], and worsening of underlying health problems.&lt;ref name=C6&gt;Cunha (2010). Pages6-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Clinical prediction rules===
Clinical prediction rules have been developed to more objectively predict outcomes of pneumonia.&lt;ref name=M32/&gt; These rules are often used in deciding whether or not to hospitalize the person.&lt;ref name=M32/&gt;
* [[Pneumonia severity index]] (or ''PSI Score'')&lt;ref name=M32/&gt;
* [[CURB-65]] score, which takes into account the severity of symptoms, any underlying diseases, and age&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Rello J | title = Demographics, guidelines, and clinical experience in severe community-acquired pneumonia | journal = Critical Care | volume = 12 Suppl 6 | issue = Suppl 6 | pages = S2 | year = 2008 | pmid = 19105795 | pmc = 2607112 | doi = 10.1186/cc7025 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pleural effusion, empyema, and abscess===
[[File:Pleural effusion.jpg|thumb|alt=An X-ray showing a chest lying horizontal. The lower black area, which is the right lung, is smaller with a whiter area below it of a pulmonary effusion. There are red arrows marking the size of these.|A [[pleural effusion]]: as seen on chest X-ray. The A arrow indicates fluid layering in the right chest. The B arrow indicates the width of the right lung. The volume of the lung is reduced because of the collection of fluid around the lung.]]

In pneumonia, a [[pleural effusion|collection of fluid]] may form in the [[pleural cavity|space that surrounds the lung]].&lt;ref name=Yu2011&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yu H | title = Management of pleural effusion, empyema, and lung abscess | journal = Seminars in Interventional Radiology | volume = 28 | issue = 1 | pages = 75–86 | date = March 2011 | pmid = 22379278 | pmc = 3140254 | doi = 10.1055/s-0031-1273942 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Occasionally, microorganisms will infect this fluid, causing an [[pleural empyema|empyema]].&lt;ref name=Yu2011/&gt; To distinguish an empyema from the more common simple [[parapneumonic effusion]], the fluid may be collected with a needle ([[thoracentesis]]), and examined.&lt;ref name=Yu2011/&gt; If this shows evidence of empyema, complete drainage of the fluid is necessary, often requiring a [[chest tube|drainage catheter]].&lt;ref name=Yu2011/&gt; In severe cases of empyema, [[Decortication|surgery]] may be needed.&lt;ref name=Yu2011/&gt; If the infected fluid is not drained, the infection may persist, because antibiotics do not penetrate well into the pleural cavity. If the fluid is sterile, it must be drained only if it is causing symptoms or remains unresolved.&lt;ref name=Yu2011/&gt;

In rare circumstances, bacteria in the lung will form a pocket of infected fluid called a [[lung abscess]].&lt;ref name=Yu2011/&gt; Lung abscesses can usually be seen with a chest X-ray but frequently require a chest CT scan to confirm the diagnosis.&lt;ref name=Yu2011/&gt; Abscesses typically occur in [[aspiration pneumonia]], and often contain several types of bacteria. Long-term antibiotics are usually adequate to treat a lung abscess, but sometimes the abscess must be drained by a [[surgery|surgeon]] or [[Interventional radiology|radiologist]].&lt;ref name=Yu2011/&gt;

===Respiratory and circulatory failure===
Pneumonia can cause respiratory failure by triggering [[acute respiratory distress syndrome]] (ARDS), which results from a combination of infection and inflammatory response.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=M31/&gt; --&gt; The lungs quickly fill with fluid and become stiff.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=M31/&gt; --&gt; This stiffness, combined with severe difficulties extracting oxygen due to the alveolar fluid, may require long periods of [[mechanical ventilation]] for survival.&lt;ref name=M31/&gt; Other causes of circulatory failure are [[hypoxemia]], [[inflammation]], and increased coagulability.&lt;ref name="Elena 2015"/&gt;

[[Sepsis]] is a potential complication of pneumonia but occurs usually in people with poor immunity or [[hyposplenism]].&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=C250/&gt; --&gt; The organisms most commonly involved are ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'', ''Haemophilus influenzae'', and ''Klebsiella pneumoniae''.&lt;!-- &lt;ref name=C250/&gt; --&gt; Other causes of the symptoms should be considered such as a [[myocardial infarction]] or a [[pulmonary embolism]].&lt;ref name=C250&gt;Cunha (2010).

Pharmakol. |volume=4 |issue=5/6 |pages=40–488 |date=1875-12-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Initial work identifying the two common bacterial causes, ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' and ''Klebsiella pneumoniae'', was performed by [[Carl Friedländer]]&lt;ref name=fried&gt;{{cite journal |author=Friedländer C |title=''Über die Schizomyceten bei der acuten fibrösen Pneumonie'' |journal=Archiv für pathologische Anatomie und Physiologie und für klinische Medizin |volume=87 |issue=2 |pages=319–324 |date=1882-02-04 |doi=10.1007/BF01880516}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Albert Fraenkel (1848–1916)|Albert Fraenkel]]&lt;ref name=fraenkel&gt;{{cite journal |author=Fraenkel A |title=''Über die genuine Pneumonie, Verhandlungen des Congress für innere Medicin'' |journal=Dritter Congress |volume=3 |pages=17–31 |date=1884-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1882 and 1884, respectively. Friedländer's initial work introduced the [[Gram staining|Gram stain]], a fundamental laboratory test still used today to identify and categorize bacteria. [[Christian Gram]]'s paper describing the procedure in 1884 helped to differentiate the two bacteria, and showed that pneumonia could be caused by more than one microorganism.&lt;ref name=gram&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gram C |title=''Über die isolierte Färbung der Schizomyceten in Schnitt- und Trocken-präparaten'' |journal=Fortschr. Med. |volume=2 |issue=6 |pages=185–9 |date=1884-03-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sir [[William Osler]], known as "the father of modern medicine", appreciated the death and disability caused by pneumonia, describing it as the "captain of the men of death" in 1918, as it had overtaken [[tuberculosis]] as one of the leading causes of death in this time. This phrase was originally coined by [[John Bunyan]] in reference to "consumption" (tuberculosis).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor=J.F. Tomashefski, Jr.|title=Dail and Hammar's pulmonary pathology|year=2008|publisher=Springer|location=New York|isbn=978-0-387-98395-0|page=228|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=j-eYLc1BA3oC&amp;pg=PA228|edition=3rd|display-authors=etal|}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first1 = William | last1 = Osler | first2 = Thomas | last2 = McCrae | name-list-format = vanc | title = The principles and practice of medicine: designed for the use of practitioners and students of medicine |publisher=D.

Several developments in the 1900s improved the outcome for those with pneumonia. With the advent of [[penicillin]] and other antibiotics, modern surgical techniques, and intensive care in the 20th century, mortality from pneumonia, which had approached 30%, dropped precipitously in the developed world. Vaccination of infants against ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]'' type B began in 1988 and led to a dramatic decline in cases shortly thereafter.&lt;ref name=adams&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Adams WG, Deaver KA, Cochi SL, Plikaytis BD, Zell ER, Broome CV, Wenger JD | title = Decline of childhood Haemophilus influenzae type b (Hib) disease in the Hib vaccine era | journal = JAMA | volume = 269 | issue = 2 | pages = 221–6 | date = January 1993 | pmid = 8417239 | doi = 10.1001/jama.1993.03500020055031 | displayauthors = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vaccination against ''Streptococcus pneumoniae'' in adults began in 1977, and in children in 2000, resulting in a similar decline.&lt;ref name=whit&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Whitney CG, Farley MM, Hadler J, Harrison LH, Bennett NM, Lynfield R, Reingold A, Cieslak PR, Pilishvili T, Jackson D, Facklam RR, Jorgensen JH, Schuchat A | title = Decline in invasive pneumococcal disease after the introduction of protein-polysaccharide conjugate vaccine | journal = The New England Journal of Medicine | volume = 348 | issue = 18 | pages = 1737–46 | date = May 2003 | pmid = 12724479 | doi = 10.1056/NEJMoa022823 | displayauthors = 2 | author14 = Active Bacterial Core Surveillance of the Emerging Infections Program Network }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Society and culture==
{{see also|List of notable pneumonia cases}}

===Awareness===
Due to the relatively low awareness of the disease, 12 November was declared as the annual [[World Pneumonia Day]], a day for concerned citizens and policy makers to take action against the disease, in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=World Pneumonia Day Official Website|url=http://worldpneumoniaday.org/|work=World Pneumonia Day Official Website|publisher=Fiinex|access-date=13 August 2011|deadurl=yes|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110902154617/http://worldpneumoniaday.org/|archive-date=2 September 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Hajjeh R, Whitney CG | title = Call to action on world pneumonia day | journal = Emerging Infectious Diseases | volume = 18 | issue = 11 | pages = 1898–9 | date = November 2012 | pmid = 23092708 | pmc = 3559175 | doi = 10.3201/eid1811.121217 | url = http://wwwnc.cdc.gov/eid/article/18/11/12-1217_article }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Costs===
The global economic cost of community-acquired pneumonia has been estimated at $17&amp;nbsp;billion annually.&lt;ref name=Clinic2011/&gt;  Other estimates are considerably higher. In 2012 the estimated aggregate costs of treating pneumonia in the United States were $20 billion;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/tables_compendia_hh_interactive.jsp?_SERVICE=MEPSSocket0&amp;_PROGRAM=MEPSPGM.TC.SAS&amp;File=HCFY2012&amp;Table=HCFY2012_CNDXP_C&amp;_Debug=|title=Household Component Summary Data Tables|format=|work=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220165205/https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/tables_compendia_hh_interactive.jsp?_SERVICE=MEPSSocket0&amp;_PROGRAM=MEPSPGM.TC.SAS&amp;File=HCFY2012&amp;Table=HCFY2012_CNDXP_C&amp;_Debug=|archive-date=20 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; the median cost of a single pneumonia-related hospitalization is over $15,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/tables_compendia_hh_interactive.jsp?_SERVICE=MEPSSocket0&amp;_PROGRAM=MEPSPGM.TC.SAS&amp;File=HCFY2012&amp;Table=HCFY2012_CNDXP_CA&amp;_Debug=|title=Household Component Summary Data Tables|format=|work=|access-date=|deadurl=no|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170220165213/https://meps.ahrq.gov/mepsweb/data_stats/tables_compendia_hh_interactive.jsp?_SERVICE=MEPSSocket0&amp;_PROGRAM=MEPSPGM.TC.SAS&amp;File=HCFY2012&amp;Table=HCFY2012_CNDXP_CA&amp;_Debug=|archive-date=20 February 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to data released by the [[Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services]], average 2012 hospital charges for inpatient treatment of uncomplicated pneumonia in the U.S. were $24,549 and ranged as high as $124,000. The average cost of an emergency room consult for pneumonia was $943 and the average cost for medication was $66.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/blogs/wonkblog/wp/2013/05/08/one-hospital-charges-8000-another-38000/ |title=One hospital charges $8,000 – another, $38,000 |work=The Washington Post}}&lt;/ref&gt; Aggregate annual costs of treating pneumonia in Europe have been estimated at €10 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Welte T, Torres A, Nathwani D | title = Clinical and economic burden of community-acquired pneumonia among adults in Europe | journal = Thorax | volume = 67 | issue = 1 | pages = 71–9 | date = January 2012 | pmid = 20729232 | doi = 10.1136/thx.2009.129502 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
{{as of|2016}} there has been one large trial studying the use of [[vitamin D]] to prevent pneumonia in children, which found no effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | vauthors = Yakoob MY, Salam RA, Khan FR, Bhutta ZA | title = Vitamin D supplementation for preventing infections in children under five years of age | journal = The Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews | volume = 11 | pages = CD008824 | date = November 2016 | pmid = 27826955 | doi = 10.1002/14651858.CD008824.pub2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Robert Biswas-Diener''' (born July 27, 1972) is a [[Positive psychology|positive psychologist]], author and instructor at Portland State University. Biswas-Diener's father is [[Ed Diener]], a psychologist.

Biswas-Diener's research focuses on income and happiness, culture and happiness, and positive psychology. Biswas-Diener's research has led him to areas such as [[India]], [[Greenland]], [[Israel]], [[Kenya]], and [[Spain]],&lt;ref name="cappeu"&gt;http://www.cappeu.com/our-team.htm&lt;/ref&gt; and he has been called the "[[Indiana Jones]] of [[positive psychology]]".&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2006/HEALTH/conditions/11/10/happiness.overview/index.html | work=CNN | title=The truth about happiness may surprise you - CNN.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; He obtained his PhD in 2009 on "Material wealth and subjective well-being" from the [[University of Tromsø]].&lt;ref name="PhD Abstract"&gt;{{cite web|last=Biswas-Diener|first=Robert|title=Material wealth and subjective well-being|url=http://www.ub.uit.no/munin/handle/10037/2332|work=PhD Abstract|publisher=[[University of Tromsø]]|accessdate=1 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Biswas-Diener is interested in looking into the difference between a procrastinator and what he calls an "incubator".&lt;ref name="Incubator"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oprah.com/spirit/Working-Under-Pressure-Can-Be-a-Strength-Robert-Biswas-Diener|title=Working Under Pressure Can Be a Strength - Robert Biswas-Diener|work=Oprah.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Biswas-Diener is an author of books and articles and sits on the editorial boards of the ''[[Journal of Happiness Studies]]'' and ''Journal of Positive Psychology''.&lt;ref name="cappeu"/&gt; Biswas-Diener also co-founded The Strengths Project, a charity whose mission is to "help underprivileged individuals and groups realise their strengths to enhance quality of life and build on their life circumstances."&lt;ref name="strengths"&gt;http://www.cappeu.com/the-strengths-project.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

== Happiness ==
The psychological study of happiness is referred to as [[subjective well-being]]. Researchers are principally interested in the measurement, causes and consequences of being happy.  Biswas-Diener has contributed to the study of happiness principally through his investigations of the well-being of exotic groups traditionally overlooked by psychologists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/3n793w69t4m30u02/|title=Most People are Pretty Happy, but There is Cultural Variation: The Inughuit, The Amish, and The Maasai | doi=10.1007/s10902-005-5683-8 | volume=6|journal=Journal of Happiness Studies|pages=205–226}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/n5221p52wh16n046/|title=The Subjective Well-Being of the Homeless, and Lessons for Happiness | doi=10.1007/s11205-005-8671-9 | volume=76|journal=Social Indicators Research|pages=185–205}}&lt;/ref&gt; These include the [[Amish]], the [[Maasai people|Maasai]] and homeless people.

== Positive Diagnosis ==
Positive psychologists have argued that there is a need create a taxonomy of “what goes right with people” as well as “what goes wrong with people.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://positivepsychologynews.com/news/louisa-jewell/2010091313509|title=Positive Psychology News Daily  » Practicing Positive Psychology Coaching by Robert Biswas-Diener (Book Review)|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous attempts have focused on uni-dimensional approaches such as identify individual strengths. Biswas-Diener has expanded on these approaches by creating a “multi-axial” approach to comprehensive diagnosis similar to the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] [[Multi-axial Approach]] used in clinical psychology. His positive diagnosis model includes:
* Axis 1: Capacities (strengths and interests)
* Axis 2: Well-being (life satisfaction and psychological well-being)
* Axis 3: Future Orientation (hope and optimism)
* Axis 4: Situational Benefactors 
* Axis 5: Values

== Incubators/Procrastinators ==
Many researchers have examined the phenomenon of procrastination. Some researchers have noted that procrastination can be adaptive. Biswas-Diener has examined the work styles of people who knowingly procrastinate and allow mounting anxiety to propel them to high performance, albeit “at the last minute.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Biswas-Diener |first1=Robert |title=Practicing Positive Psychology Coaching: Assessment, Activities and Strategies for Success |type=Paperback |edition=1 |date=7 September 2010 |publisher=Wiley |isbn=0470536764}}&lt;/ref&gt; He has identified this work style as “incubator.”

== Strengths ==
A major area of interest within positive psychology theory and research has been on the topic of strengths. Strengths are disproportionately represented among publications in the [[Journal of Positive Psychology]]. Biswas-Diener and his colleagues argue that strengths are potentials rather than traits and that they can be cultivated through effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/17439760.2010.545429|title=A dynamic approach to psychological strength development and intervention |publisher=TandFOnline | doi=10.1080/17439760.2010.545429 |volume=6 |journal=The Journal of Positive Psychology |pages=106–118}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following from this argument is the idea that strengths can be over or underused and that “strengths development” is largely a matter of learning to use strengths appropriately to unique situations. They further argue that if used inappropriately strengths use may be associated with social costs or personal psychological harm.

== Courage ==
Biswas-Diener has written that courage consists of two separable processes: managing the emotion of fear and “boosting the willingness to act”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Biswas-Diener |first1=Robert |title=The Courage Quotient |type=Hardcover|edition=1 |date=10 April 2012 |publisher=Jossey-Bass |isbn=0470917423}}&lt;/ref&gt; He suggests that courage consists of skills that can be learned.

'''Samaritan Aviation''' is a 501 C-3 non-profit Christian organization that serves the population in the [[East Sepik Province]] of [[Papua New Guinea]] through emergency evacuation flights, the delivery of medical supplies, and continued community outreach and health programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

==History==
Samaritan Aviation was founded in 1999 by Mark Palm and Gary Bustin as a means of providing crucial medical services to the [[East Sepik Province]] of [[Papua New Guinea]]. To avoid the difficult transport through 30,000 square miles of jungle, Samaritan Aviation introduced the country’s only floatplane in 2010, a retrofitted [[Cessna 206]], which dramatically increased the availability of healthcare to around 500,000 people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In August 2015, Samaritan Aviation launched their Every Life Matters Tour, introducing their second Cessna 206 floatplane and making stops in Dallas, San Antonio, Denver, Montrose, Prescott, Mesa, and Kingman before shipping the plane to Papua New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Headquartered in [[Basel]], [[Switzerland]], the '''Straumann Group''' ({{SIX Swiss Exchange|STMN}}) researches and develops, manufactures and supplies dental implants, instruments, biomaterials, CADCAM prosthetics, digital equipment, software, and clear aligners for applications in replacement, restorative, orthodontic and preventative dentistry.

The Straumann Group also offers services to the dental profession worldwide, including training and education, which is provided in collaboration with the International Team for Implantology (ITI)&lt;ref name="ITI"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.iti.org|title= ITI website |access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the  Instituto Latino Americano de Pesquisa e Ensino Odontológico (ILAPEO).

Altogether, the Straumann Group employs approximately 5,700 people worldwide and its products and services are available in more than 100 countries through a broad network of distribution subsidiaries and partners.&lt;ref name="2018Q3" /&gt;

== History ==

The history of the Straumann Group has three distinct eras and spans more than half a century. It began in the Swiss village of Waldenburg in 1954 with the foundation of a research institute bearing the name of its founder, Dr Ing. Reinhardt Straumann&lt;ref name="Watch Wiki"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://watch-wiki.org/index.php?title=Straumann,_Reinhard|title= Reinhard Straumann on Watch Wiki |access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="personenlexikon.bl.ch"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://personenlexikon.bl.ch/Reinhard_Straumann|title= Reinhard Straumann on personenlexikon.bl.ch (German) |access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== 1954&amp;ndash;1970 ===

Between 1954 and 1970, the company specialized in alloys used in timing instruments and in materials testing. Among Straumann’s renowned inventions in this period were special alloys that are still used in watch springs today. A breakthrough in the use of non-corroding alloys for treating bone fractures prompted Dr Fritz Straumann to enter the fields of orthopedics and dental implantology, which began the second phase of the company’s history.

'''1954'''&lt;br&gt;
In the small town of Waldenburg, at the foot of the Swiss Jura, Reinhard Straumann founds the "Dr Ing. R. Straumann Research Institute AG".

'''1960'''&lt;br&gt;
The Swiss Association for the Study of Internal Fixation (AO/ASIF) is looking for a company that is capable of providing materials for internal fixation implants - Dr H.C. Fritz Straumann, son of the company’s founder, gets in touch.

=== 1970&amp;ndash;1990 ===

Between 1970 and 1990, Straumann became a leading manufacturer of osteosynthesis implants. A management buy-out of the osteosynthesis division in 1990 led to the creation of Stratec (subsequently [[Synthes]]) as a separate company. 1990 thus marked the beginning of the Straumann Group as it is known today. Thomas Straumann, grandson of the founder, headed the remaining part of the firm, which employed just 25 people focused exclusively on dental implants.

Another major milestone in the company’s history was in 1980 when Straumann established a partnership with the International Team for Implantology. The 1980s also marked the company’s geographic expansion, with subsidiaries in Germany (1980) and the US (1989). The following are examples of achievements:

''' 1974'''&lt;br&gt;
The first dental implants are developed at the Institut Straumann and undergo successful clinical testing at the University of Berne.

'''1980'''&lt;br&gt;
Under the aegis of Dr Fritz Straumann, Waldenburg, and Prof Schroeder, University of Berne, the International Team for Implantology, the ITI, is founded.

'''1990'''&lt;br&gt;
After a management buy-out of the internal fixation division, Thomas Straumann focuses the activities of the Institut Straumann AG on the area of implant dentistry.

=== 1998 - Today ===

In 1998, Straumann Holding AG became a publicly traded company on the Swiss exchange. Through the acquisition of Kuros Therapeutics (2002) and Biora (2003), Straumann entered the promising field of oral tissue regeneration.

'''1998'''&lt;br&gt;
The Straumann Holding AG goes public and is listed on the Swiss stock exchange.

'''2000'''&lt;br&gt;
With the opening of the production site in Villeret, located in the Berne Jura, and the Technology Center in Waldenburg, new dimensions open up for the international Straumann group.

'''2002'''&lt;br&gt;
Straumann acquires Kuros Therapeutics AG and extends its activities into the field of biomaterials.

'''2003'''&lt;br&gt;
Straumann acquires the Swedish company Biora, a pioneer in the area of biologically based regeneration of dental tissue.

'''2004'''&lt;br&gt;
Straumann moves into its new headquarters in [[Basel]].

'''2011'''&lt;br&gt;
Investment in Dental Wings, a developer and provider of CADCAM software and scanning technology, based in Canada.

'''2012'''&lt;br&gt;
Straumann acquires Neodent from Brazil and extends its activities into the value Market.

'''2013'''&lt;br&gt;
Straumann invests in Medentika and Createch – both companies are active in prosthetics.

'''2016'''&lt;br&gt;
Straumann acquires Equinox&lt;ref name="Equinox"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/5443625/global-dental-implants-industry.html|title= Straumann to Take Over Equinox.

The company also invests in the French implant maker Anthogyr&lt;ref name="Anthogyr"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.reportbuyer.com/product/5443625/global-dental-implants-industry.html|title= Straumann Partners Anthogyr. In: Global Dental Implants Industry; ReportBuyer Ltd, Report ID: 5443625 |access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; to address the non-premium segment in China.

'''2017'''&lt;br&gt;

== Production facilities ==
The Group's principal production sites for implant components and instruments are in Brazil, Germany, India, Switzerland and the US, while CADCAM prosthetics are milled in Brazil, China, Germany, Japan and the US. Biomaterials are produced in Sweden, digital equipment in Canada and Germany, and clear aligners in the US.

=== Villeret (Switzerland) ===
All major components of the Straumann Dental Implant System are currently manufactured at Straumann's factory in Villeret, Switzerland&lt;ref name="Villeret"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.aargauerzeitung.ch/wirtschaft/straumann-auf-den-zahn-gefuehlt-128572122|title= Straumann in Villeret (German) |access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

Villeret became operational in 2000. Continued global volume growth made it necessary to expand capacity, and a second production floor was fitted out in 2005. As a result, Villeret now operates two fully independent production lines, one producing surgical products (implants) and the other manufacturing components for the range of implant prosthetics (abutments). Villeret also houses the manufacturing unit for Straumann's third generation implant surface technology SLActive.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

=== Andover (USA) ===
The North American headquarters in Andover&lt;ref name="Andover"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bizjournals.com/boston/stories/2005/06/20/newscolumn1.html|title= Connections counted in luring Straumann to Andover |access-date=18 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; house Straumann’s first manufacturing unit outside Switzerland and produces implant system components and instruments.

The 7,400-square-meter (80,000-square-foot) production area complements Straumann’s current production unit in Villeret, Switzerland. It is also the home office location for Neodent, the Brazilian value implant Straumann acquired in 2013 as part of its product portfolio.{{cn|date=July 2018}}

=== Malmö (Sweden) ===
Straumann's production unit in Malmö is devoted primarily to the specialized manufacture of regenerative products.

In June 2003 Straumann acquired the Swedish company Biora&lt;ref name="Biora AB"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.svd.se/naringsliv/sok-foretag/companyInfo.html?companyId=2K008C6I5YFOF |title= Biora AB |access-date=25 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which specialized in the manufacture of the protein-based products for tissue regeneration.

The '''Therapeutic Goods Administration''' ('''TGA''') is the [[regulatory body]] for therapeutic goods (including medicines, medical devices, gene technology, and blood products) in [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tga.gov.au/about/|title=About the TGA|publisher=Department of Health Therapeutic Goods Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a Division of the Australian [[Department of Health and Ageing (Australia)|Department of Health]] established under the ''Therapeutic Goods Act 1989 (Cth)''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tga.gov.au/industry/legislation-about.htm#.Up2yD6r8nFA|title=About the Australian therapeutic goods legislation|publisher=Department of Health Therapeutic Goods Administration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.comlaw.gov.au/Series/C2004A03952 ''Therapeutic Goods Act 1999'' (Cth)]&lt;/ref&gt; The TGA is responsible for conducting assessment and monitoring activities to ensure that therapeutic goods available in Australia are of an acceptable standard and that access to therapeutic advances is in a timely manner.

== TGA Expert Advisory Committees ==
The TGA has nine statutory expert committees it may call upon to obtain independent advice on scientific and technical matters, including:
* Advisory Committee on Biologicals (ACB) 
* Advisory Committee on Complementary Medicines (ACCM)
* Advisory Committee on Medical Devices (ACMD)
* Advisory Committee on Non-prescription Medicines (ACNM)
* Advisory Committee on Prescription Medicines (ACPM)
* Advisory Committee on the Safety of Medical Devices (ACSMD)
* Advisory Committee on the Safety of Medicines (ACSOM)
* Advisory Committee on the Safety of Vaccines (ACSOV)
* Therapeutic Goods Committee (TGC) – advises the Minister on standards for therapeutic goods, including labelling and packaging, and on principles to be observed in the manufacture of therapeutic goods for use in humans.

==Trans-Tasman harmonisation==
The governments of Australia and [[New Zealand]] were working towards establishing a [[Trans-Tasman]] joint agency for the regulation of drugs and therapeutic goods to replace the TGA and New Zealand's [[Medsafe]]. However, on 16 July 2007, the New Zealand State Services Minister Annette King announced that "The Government is not proceeding at this stage with legislation that would have enabled the establishment of a joint agency with Australia to regulate therapeutic products". She further advised that "The [New Zealand] Government does not have the numbers in Parliament to put in place a sensible, acceptable compromise that would satisfy all parties at this time. The Australian Government has been informed of the situation and agrees that suspending negotiations on the joint authority is a sensible course of action". Further details are available at the [[Australia New Zealand Therapeutic Products Authority]] (ANZTPA) website.

'''Thomas Annandale''', [[Fellow of the Royal College of Surgeons|FRCS]] [[Royal Society of Edinburgh|FRSE]] (1838–1907) was a Scottish surgeon who conducted the first repair of the [[Meniscus (anatomy)|meniscus]], the first successful removal of an acoustic neuroma and introduced the pre-peritoneal approach to [[inguinal hernia]] repair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Di Matteo B, Tarabella V, Filardo G, Viganò A, Tomba P, Marcacci M |title=Thomas Annandale: the first meniscus repair |journal=Knee Surgery, Sports Traumatology, Arthroscopy |volume=21 |issue=9 |pages=1963–6 |date=September 2013  |pmid=23575648 |doi=10.1007/s00167-013-2490-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Regius Chair of Clinical Surgery|url=http://www.ed.ac.uk/polopoly_fs/1.55988!/fileManager/History%20of%20the%20Chair%20of%20Clinical%20Surgery.pdf|publisher=Edinburgh University|accessdate=19 October 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120711004558/http://www.ed.ac.uk/polopoly_fs/1.55988!/fileManager/History%20of%20the%20Chair%20of%20Clinical%20Surgery.pdf|archivedate=11 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; He served as [[Regius Professor of Clinical Surgery]] at the [[University of Edinburgh]]. His collection of anatomical specimens was donated to the [[Surgeon's Hall]] in [[Edinburgh]] and is now known as the '''Thomas Annandale Collection'''. 

==Life==
Born in [[Newcastle-upon-Tyne]] on 2 February 1838, he was third son of Thomas Annandale, surgeon, by his wife Elizabeth Johnston.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=30422|title=Annandale, Thomas|first=B. A.|last=Bryan}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was educated at Bruce's Academy in Newcastle, and then apprenticed to his father. Continuing medical studies at [[Newcastle Infirmary]], he matriculated in 1856 at [[Edinburgh University Medical School]], and graduated M.D. in 1860 with the highest honours, receiving the gold medal for his thesis ''On the Injuries and Diseases of the Hip Joint''.&lt;ref name="DNB"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Annandale, Thomas|volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Annandale was appointed in 1860 house-surgeon to [[James Syme]] at the [[Edinburgh Royal Infirmary]], and was Syme's private assistant from 1861 to 1870. In 1863 he was admitted Fellow of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh]], and became a junior demonstrator of anatomy in the university under [[John Goodsir]]. He was also appointed in 1863 a lecturer on the principles of surgery in the extramural school of medicine, and gave there a course of lectures yearly until 1871, when he began to lecture on clinical surgery at the Royal Infirmary. Annandale was admitted a member of the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]], on 15 July 1859, and Fellow on 12 April 1888; in 1864 he won the Jacksonian prize for his dissertation on ''The malformations, diseases and injuries of the fingers and toes, with their surgical treatment'' (Edinburgh 1865).&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt;

Appointed assistant surgeon to the Royal Infirmary at Edinburgh in 1865, and acting surgeon there in 1871, Annandale became regius professor of clinical surgery in the University of Edinburgh in 1877, in succession to [[Joseph Lister, 1st Baron Lister|Joseph Lister]], who then moved to [[King's College London]]. He was made honorary [[D.C.L.]] of the [[University of Durham]] in April 1902,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times |articlename=University intelligence |day_of_week=Monday |date=28 April 1902 |page_number=12 |issue=36753| }}&lt;/ref&gt; and was surgeon-general to the [[Royal Company of Archers]], from 27 May 1900 until his death. He joined as an archer in 1870.&lt;ref name="DNB"/&gt; He was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society of Edinburgh]] in 1867.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf| title=Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh. 1783–2002|publisher = Royal Society of Edinburgh|accessdate=3 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The newly graduated [[Richard James Arthur Berry]] came to work under him, as House Surgeon in the Royal Infirmary, in 1891.&lt;ref name="anu"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://adb.anu.edu.au/biography/berry-richard-james-arthur-5220|title=Biography - Richard James Berry - Australian Dictionary of Biography|website=adb.anu.edu.au|accessdate=4 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his final years Annandale is listed as living at 31 [[Charlotte Square]], one of Edinburgh's most prestigious addresses.&lt;ref&gt;Edinburgh and Leith Post Office Directory 1905-6&lt;/ref&gt;

Annandale died suddenly on 20 December 1907, having operated as usual at the Royal Infirmary on the previous day. He was buried in the [[Dean Cemetery]] in western [[Edinburgh]]. The grave lies in the northern section, backing onto the dividing wall to the original cemetery.

==Recognition==

* ''Observations and Cases in Surgery'', 1875.
* ''On the Pathology and Operative Treatment of Hip Disease'', 1876.

==Family==

'''World Malaria Day''' ('''WMD''') is an [[international observance]] commemorated every year on 25 April and recognizes global efforts to control [[malaria]]. Globally, 3.3 billion people in 106 countries are at risk of malaria.&lt;ref name=WHO2010&gt;World Health Organization,[http://www.who.int/malaria/world_malaria_report_2010/en/index.html ''World Malaria Report 2010''.]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, malaria caused an estimated 627,000 deaths, mostly among African children.&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/mediacentre/factsheets/fs094/en/ Malaria.] WHO Fact sheet N°94, updated March 2014. Accessed 8 April 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Asia, Latin America, and to a lesser extent the Middle East and parts of Europe are also affected.

World Malaria Day sprung out of the efforts taking place across the African continent to commemorate '''Africa Malaria Day'''. WMD is one of eight official [[global health|global public health]] campaigns currently marked by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO), along with [[World Health Day]], [[World Blood Donor Day]], [[World Immunization Week]], [[World Tuberculosis Day]], [[World No Tobacco Day]], [[World Hepatitis Day]] and [[World AIDS Day]].&lt;ref&gt;World Health Organization, [http://www.who.int/campaigns/en WHO campaigns.]&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the most recent World Malaria Report, the global tally of malaria reached 429,000 malaria deaths and 212 million new cases in 2015. The rate of new malaria cases fell by 21 per cent globally between 2010 and 2015, and malaria death rates fell by 29 per cent in the same period. In sub-Saharan Africa, case incidence and death rates fell by 21 per cent and 31 per cent, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jatinder|first1=Kaur|title=World Malaria Day Asks Malaria Prevention|url=http://abclive.in/world-malaria-day-malaria-prevention/|accessdate=30 April 2017|agency=ABC Live|issue=Online|publisher=ABC Live}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
'''World Malaria Day''' was established in May 2007 by the 60th session of the [[World Health Assembly]], WHO's decision-making body. The day was established to provide "education and understanding of malaria" and spread information on "year-long intensified implementation of national malaria-control strategies, including community-based activities for malaria prevention and treatment in endemic areas."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/gb/ebwha/pdf_files/WHA60/A60_R18-en.pdf WHA Resolution 60.18]&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the establishment of WMD, '''Africa Malaria Day'''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rollbackmalaria.org/globaladvocacy/africamalariaday.html Africa Malaria Days 2001-2007]&lt;/ref&gt; was held on April 25. Africa Malaria Day began in 2001, one year after the historic ''Abuja Declaration''&lt;ref&gt;African Summit on Roll Back Malaria, [http://www.rollbackmalaria.org/docs/abuja_declaration_final.htm Abuja Declaration.] Abuja, 25 April 2000.&lt;/ref&gt; was signed by 44 malaria-endemic countries at the African Summit on Malaria.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.rollbackmalaria.org/globaladvocacy/africansummit2000.html African Malaria Summit]&lt;/ref&gt;

World Malaria Day allows for corporations (such as [[ExxonMobil]]&lt;ref&gt;ExxonMobil, [http://www.exxonmobil.com/Corporate/community_malaria_wmd.aspx Commemorating World Malaria Day 2013.]&lt;/ref&gt;), multinational organizations (such as [[Malaria No More]]&lt;ref&gt;Malaria No More UK, [http://malarianomore.org.uk/world-malaria-day World Malaria Day.]&lt;/ref&gt;) and grassroots organizations (such as [[Mosquitoes Suck Tour]]&lt;ref&gt;http://dontbiteme.ca/more-about-malaria/&lt;/ref&gt;) globally to work together to bring [[awareness]] to malaria and advocate for [[health policy|policy]] changes.&lt;ref&gt;Malaria Community, [http://www.worldmalariaday.org/about_the_site_en.cfm World Malaria Day.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===

April 25 was designated as ''Malaria Awareness Day'' in 2007 by President [[George W. Bush]], who called on Americans to join in on the goal to eradicate malaria on the African continent.&lt;ref name="GB"&gt;George W. Bush. The White House: Office of the Press Secretary. [https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/04/20070424-11.html Malaria Awareness Day, 2007.] 24 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;  President Bush described it as a day when "we focus our attention on all who suffer from this terrible disease -- especially the millions on the continent of Africa. We remember the millions more who died from this entirely preventable and treatable disease."  President Bush shared the White House's strategic plan against malaria, which included endeavors to distribute bed nets with the New York-based nonprofit group [[Malaria No More]].&lt;ref name="WH"&gt;The White House: Office of the Press Secretary. [https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2007/04/20070425-2.html President Bush and Mrs. Bush Discuss Malaria Awareness Day.] 25 April 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other former U.S. Presidents are involved in anti-malaria efforts. Former President [[Bill Clinton]]'s [[Clinton Foundation]] includes an anti-malaria component that, according to director [[Inder Singh (philanthropist)|Inder Singh]] has distributed anti-malaria drugs to millions in Africa and Asia.&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;[http://hst.mit.edu/servlet/ControllerServlet?handler=PublicHandler&amp;action=browse&amp;pageId=2261 BEP grad Inder Singh orchestrates affordable malaria drug development], Harvard-MIT Health Sciences.&lt;/ref&gt;

Many prominent companies, organizations, and celebrities have declared initiatives to join the fight against malaria to mark this day. These include a $3 million "challenge grant" announced by [[ExxonMobil]] to match donations dollar by dollar to [[Malaria No More]], as part of the "[[Idol Gives Back]]" episodes of [[American Idol]], which was aired on Malaria Awareness Day.  [[Major League Soccer]] Commissioner [[Don Garber]] also announced that the league would promote malaria awareness and bed net fundraising promotions in the month of April leading up to  Malaria Awareness Day. Actress [[Ashley Judd]], announced the April launch of a new initiative called “5 &amp; Alive,” which will focus on the devastating effects of malaria on children under 5.  The [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America]] announced their own national campaign called "Malaria Prevention: Deadly Disease.  Simple Solution", which will partner with Malaria No More to approach all 4.7 Million Club members worldwide to ask for $10 bed net donations.&lt;ref name="MNM"&gt;Malaria No More. [http://www.malarianomore.org/media/malarianomore-mad-32907.pdf Run up to April 25, the First Malaria Awareness Day in the US.] 29 March 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The movement is not without its critics, such as the African economist [[Dambisa Moyo]] who warns that the short term benefits of aid such as mosquito nets can have long term detrimental effects to the sustainability of African economies. When the markets are flooded with foreign nets then this puts African entrepreneurs out of business.{{citation needed|date=October 2014}}
