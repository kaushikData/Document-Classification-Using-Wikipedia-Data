The '''Flyers–Red Army game''' was a famous international [[ice hockey]] game played on January 11, 1976, between the [[Philadelphia Flyers]] of the [[North America]]-based [[National Hockey League]] (NHL), and [[HC CSKA Moscow]] (Central Sports Club of the Army Moscow, Russian: '''ХК ЦСКА Москва''', also known as the "Red Army Team") of the [[Soviet Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://flyers.nhl.com/club/news.htm?id=435985 |title=Great Moments: Flyers Conquer the Red Army |author=Meltzer, Bill |publisher=philadelphiaflyers.com |date=10 January 2008 |accessdate=15 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The game was notable for an incident where, after a [[Checking (ice hockey)|body check]] delivered by the Flyers' [[Ed Van Impe]], CSKA's top player, [[Valeri Kharlamov]], was prone on the ice for a minute. When officials did not call a penalty, the Red Army coach, Konstantin Loktev, pulled his team off the ice in protest. Flyers' Chairman [[Ed Snider]] told CSKA to return to the ice and finish the game, which was being broadcast to an international audience, or the Soviet Hockey Federation would not get paid the fee to which they were entitled. They eventually complied and lost 4–1.

The Flyers were the only NHL team which managed to defeat the Red Army.

==Background==
HC CSKA Moscow was one of the most dominant sports teams in history, winning the Soviet championship for 13 consecutive years between 1977 and 1989. CSKA played many games against NHL clubs, including a [[Super Series '76|North American tour]] in 1975 and 1976. In total, the Red Army Club played 36 games against NHL teams from 1975 to 1991 and finished with a record of 26 wins, 8 losses, and 2 ties.

The 1975–76 series between various NHL teams and two touring Soviet teams, the powerhouse Red Army team and the somewhat lesser [[Krylya Sovetov Moscow|Soviet Wings]] squad, was another pivotal moment in the tenuous relations between the NHL and the Soviet hockey program. The games, like the subsequent [[Canada Cup]] Tournaments which also began in 1976, were not treated like exhibitions. Coming into the final match of their NHL series, the Red Army was still undefeated, having tied the [[Montreal Canadiens]] and beaten the other NHL teams they faced. Their final game was to be played in the [[Spectrum (arena)|Spectrum]] in [[Philadelphia]] against the two-time defending [[Stanley Cup]] champion Flyers. Both Soviet teams were supplemented by other All Stars from their league.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chidlovski.com/personal/1974/world/ss75.htm|title=Superseries 1975-75: CSKA and Krylya Sovetov vs NHL clubs|website=www.chidlovski.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before CSKA had arrived in Philadelphia, the Soviet players and hockey leaders were aware of the rough reputation of the "[[Philadelphia Flyers#1972.E2.80.9379: Broad Street Bullies Era|Broad Street Bullies]]." A [[Pravda]] cartoon had portrayed the Flyers as [[Neanderthal]] thugs wielding clubs instead of sticks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.flyershistory.net/cgi-bin/hm.cgi?006hm|title=Flyers History - Historic Moments|first=Peter|last=Anson|website=www.flyershistory.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flyers captain [[Bobby Clarke]]'s reputation was already cemented due partly to his actions in the 1972 [[Summit Series]], where he delivered an infamous slash to the ankle of [[Valeri Kharlamov]] in Game Six.

Flyers owner [[Ed Snider]] had several reasons to dislike the Soviets, in addition to [[Cold War|Soviet-Western political tensions]]. Tough, often contentious, negotiations took place with Soviet officials before the series became a reality, in which Snider was actively involved. The Flyers' owner found his patience tried by the difficult negotiating process with the Soviet officials. (Snider was criticized by some as being hypocritical for allowing his hockey team to participate in a series that would pump money into Soviet coffers.) Finally, there were strictly hockey-related reasons for Snider to dislike the Soviets so strongly. The diametrically opposite styles of hockey practiced by the Flyers and Red Army Team created an instant source of conflict. Although the Flyers of the mid-1970s were actually a very skilled team (with the likes of future Hall of Famers [[Bobby Clarke]], [[Bill Barber]], and [[Bernie Parent]] plus all-star caliber talents such as [[Reggie Leach]], [[Rick MacLeish]], and defensive defenseman [[Jimmy Watson (ice hockey)|Jimmy Watson]]), they were best known for their aggressive brand of physical play. Snider's competitive fires were stoked by the realization that the chance to play the Soviets represented a chance to prove that his squad was the best team in the world and much more than a "goon squad."

==The game==
A goodwill get-together before the game was fraught with tension. Flyers announcer [[Gene Hart]], who spoke Russian, taught Flyers owner Ed Snider to say a phrase in Russian wishing the best for both teams in the upcoming game. When the time came, there was no mingling whatsoever between the Soviet contingent and Flyers staff and players. When Snider took to the podium, he spoke tersely and omitted the phrase Hart had taught him. Snider later said, "when I looked at all those cold faces, I just couldn't do it." Clarke later said that he, too, "really hated those bastards" on the Soviet side and could not wait to take to the ice against them once again.

The Flyers dictated the game's tempo and were able to take the body on the Soviet players and avoid getting caught in the Soviet up-tempo transition game. In the first period, with the game still scoreless, Flyers defenseman [[Ed Van Impe]], who had just finished serving a penalty for hooking, left the box and immediately placed a hard hit on CSKA star [[Valeri Kharlamov]], toppling the latter and causing him to lie prone on the ice for a minute. When officials refused to call a penalty, maintaining that Van Impe's check was clean, Red Army coach Loktev protested by pulling the team from the ice. This led to commentator Bob Cole saying, "They're going home!" reapeately. Snider got into a shouting match with the president of the Soviet Hockey Federation, threatening to not pay for the series if they did not return to the ice. The Soviets prolonged the game stoppage by arguing to make their return to the ice conditional on the referee canceling their impending delay of game bench penalty. Eventually, they accepted the penalty and came back to the ice.

The game delay tactic backfired on them as they returned to find the Flyers even more resolute than before. The Flyers scored quickly after play resumed and never looked back. They outshot the Soviets 49–13 en route to their 4–1 victory.

==After the game==
Flyers head coach [[Fred Shero]] jokingly told low-scoring defenseman [[Joe Watson (ice hockey)|Joe Watson]] that the latter had set the Soviet hockey program back 25 years by scoring a [[Short handed|shorthanded goal]] on the great [[Vladislav Tretiak]]. Amidst the Flyers' pride in their convincing victory against an outstanding team, the seeds of contentiousness had grown even further. To this day, Tretiak, who views the tie game in the [[Montreal Forum]] as the highpoint of the series, says that the Flyers won by playing "rude hockey." Coach Loktev called the Flyers "a bunch of animals." The Flyers, meanwhile, left with the belief that the Soviet team had confirmed their feelings that Russian players were skilled but soft.

[[Milt Dunnell]] of the ''[[Toronto Star]]'' had written this comment after the close of the series: "The Moscow Musketeers had to put a big fat zero on their aptitude test by pulling one the dumbest tricks in sports. They hauled their team off the ice. Loktev knew the conditions before he came. Nobody loves playing in Philadelphia. Once he accepted a game with the Flyers, under NHL rules, with an NHL referee, he was in the same boat as the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] or [[Vancouver Canucks]] when they come to town. Loktev wanted his team to know what's it's like to play the Flyers in Philly under NHL conditions. Well...that's what it's like."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flyershistory.com/cgi-bin/hm.cgi?006hm |title=January 11th, 1976 - Flyers vs Red Army Flyers Humble the Big Red Machine |author=P.Anson |publisher=FlyersHistory.com |year=2008 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==
A little more than a decade after the showdown in the Spectrum, the Soviet Union was crumbling politically. In order to raise funds, the Soviet hockey program started to negotiate to auction off selected prominent national team veterans to be dispersed to NHL teams. The Sniders refused to get the Flyers involved in seeking to acquire any Soviet players, citing the fact that the Soviet officials were demanding a large portion of the players' NHL salaries be diverted into their hands rather than being given to the players. Later, of course, the Flyers began to scout and draft Soviet players on the same basis as they would players from any hockey country.

'''Widespread protests and riots''' in [[Serbia]] and [[North Kosovo]] followed the [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|proclamation of independence]] by the [[Republic of Kosovo]] on February 17, 2008. Protests were also held by Serbs in Bosnia and Herzegovina and Montenegro.

===''Kosovo is Serbia'' protest===
{{main|Kosovo is Serbia}} [[Image:Tri prsta3.jpg|thumb|right|Kosovo is Serbia rally on February 21, 2008 in Belgrade]]
On February 21, a very large demonstration called ''[[Kosovo is Serbia]]'' (Косово је Србија, ''Kosovo je Srbija'') was held in Belgrade in front of the Parliament organized by the Serbian government, with up to hundreds of thousands people attending it.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.blic.rs/Vesti/Politika/307387/Cetiri-godine-od-proglasenja-nezavisnosti-Kosova&lt;/ref&gt; Speakers at the protest were: Prime Minister [[Vojislav Koštunica]], opposition leader [[Tomislav Nikolić]], Republika Srpska Prime Minister [[Milorad Dodik]], Montenegro opposition leader [[Andrija Mandić]], Montenegro opposition politician [[Predrag Popović]], basketball player [[Dejan Bodiroga]], filmmaker [[Emir Kusturica]], tennis player [[Novak Đoković]] (via link), actors [[Ivana Žigon]], [[Nenad Jezdić]] and [[Nataša Tapušković]], and Yugoslav crown prince [[Alexander, Crown Prince of Yugoslavia|Alexander Karađorđević]].

After the protest, people went to the [[Temple of Saint Sava]] for a religious service, where a speech was held by acting head of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]], Metropolitan Archbishop [[Amfilohije]] Risto Radović [[Metropolitanate of Montenegro and the Littoral|of Montenegro and the Littoral]].

The [[president of Serbia]] and commander-in-chief of [[Military of Serbia|Serbian Armed Forces]], [[Boris Tadic]] ([[Democratic Party (Serbia)|Democratic Party]]), did not attend.
The rally was not supported by the [[Liberal Democratic Party (Serbia 2005)|Liberal Democratic Party]]&lt;ref&gt;

They waved Serbian flags, chanting "Kosovo is Serbia" and other slogans against the prime minister and his cabinet, calling them [[ustasha]]s and [[shqiptar|shiptar]]s. At the end of the rally, riots broke out and small groups attacked riot police in front of the parliament building. The rioters were eventually driven back by police, and 28 people were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/vesti/text.php?vest%3D112531 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-10-19 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081017055708/http://www.mtsmondo.com/news/vesti/text.php?vest=112531 |archivedate=2008-10-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8961">The '''added worker effect''' refers to an increase in the [[labor supply]] of married women when their husbands become unemployed. Underlying the theory is the assumption that married women are secondary workers with a less permanent attachment to the labor market than their partners. As statistics show, married women do not always behave as secondary workers; therefore, the effect is not a universal phenomenon.
[[File:AWE Model.png|thumb|Simple model of the added worker effect after Shelly Lundberg's (1985)]]

== Origin of idea ==

The concept of “additional workers” appeared in empiric studies on unemployment in the United States during the Great Depression conducted in 1940 by economists [[Wladimir S. Woytinsky]] and Don D. Humphrey (Humphrey, 1940, p.&amp;nbsp;412). Humphrey's study did not find any observable added worker effect, but it did not deny that added workers participated in the market (Humphrey, p.&amp;nbsp;415). He challenged the validity of Woytinsky's study in the absence of a [[time series analysis]].

== Relation to income and substitution effects ==
In the added worker effect married women are willing to work more for pay as a response to a loss of [[real income]] despite the price of leisure dropping in relation to the wage rate.

A common model used to study the added worker effect views the family as a decision making unit and leisure time as a [[normal good]]. With this understanding, a married woman may chose to enter the labor market to offset the loss of income her family faces when her husband loses his job. Since family wages are pooled and the price of consuming leisure varies among individuals depending on earning power, an increase in one individual's income may result in other family members gaining leisure time by working less (Mincer, 1962, p.&amp;nbsp;65). The [[diminishing marginal utility]] of income explains why the family would work fewer hours.

Women's earning power, which is typically less than that of their husbands, depends on wage rates and employment opportunities (Mincer, p.&amp;nbsp;66). While earning power and labor force participation have a positive correlation, an inverse relationship characterizes husbands' income and wives' participation in the labor market. Therefore, women may be less inclined to enter the labor force when earning power rises for both men and women.

The added worker effect results when the income effect dominates the substitution effect in an individual's decision whether or not to participate in the labor market. The income and substitution effects are concepts in the [[consumer choice theory]] of microeconomics.

For added workers to enter the labor market when earning power decreases, the negative income effect must outweigh the positive substitution effect (Mincer, p.&amp;nbsp;68). In families whose male head of household loses his job, “the relative decline in family income is much stronger than the relative decline in the 'expected' wage rate of the wife.” In this case, the net effect leads the wife to enter the labor market, thereby increasing the labor supply. An example of the effect can be found in a study by Arnold Katz, who attributes the bulk of the increase in married female workers in the depression of 1958 “to the distress[ed] job seeking of wives whose husbands were out of work” (1961, p.&amp;nbsp;478).

== Variables that determine prevalence of added workers ==

=== Recessionary characteristics ===
Multiple variables contribute to the added worker effect. Since increasing labor supplied remains one of many strategies families can use to cope with unemployment, its use depends on the relative price and effectiveness of alternatives ([[Shelly Lundberg|Lundberg]], 1985, p.&amp;nbsp;12). Alternative responses include borrowing, living off savings, selling assets, [[consumption smoothing]], and undertaking a more intensive job search by the husband (Lundberg, p.&amp;nbsp;12; Serneels, 2002). In recessions, credit constraints become more relevant, making it more likely that the Added Worker Effect will be observed (Lundberg, p.&amp;nbsp;12).

=== Household characteristics ===
When faced with an unemployed husband, a wife's decision to seek more employment is predicted partly by the level of unemployment benefits available, the duration of the unemployment, general labor market conditions in the surrounding area, her age, and her personal employment experiences in the preceding year (Katz, p.&amp;nbsp;478). The presence of young children usually hinders the employment of married mothers, Katz found that the added worker effect is more pronounced among young married couples with small children, perhaps due to higher levels of debt (Mattingly &amp; Smith, 2010, p.&amp;nbsp;346; Maloney, 1991; Katz,p.&amp;nbsp;478).

== The added worker effect after the Great Recession ==

=== Long-term unemployment's impact on the added worker effect ===
During the [[Great Recession]], which spanned December 2007 to June 2009, the average duration of unemployment reached a record high in the United States, which led to an increased incidence of the added worker effect (Rampell, 2010). The labor force participation rate of the wife rises with the expectation that her husband will be unemployed permanently due to aging or other factors (Maloney, p.&amp;nbsp;183). Women who expect their husbands will be unemployed for the long-run are more likely to accept a job when they have the opportunity, but without the intention of dropping out implied by the Added Worker Effect.

=== Prevalence of women as primary workers ===
A prolonged period of unemployment can lead to what economists call the discouraged worker effect, where workers drop out of the labor supply. The wives of discouraged workers do not behave as secondary workers, altering their labor supply in response to their spouses' transitory bouts with unemployment, but rather, these wives become [[Breadwinner model|breadwinners]] (Maloney, p.&amp;nbsp;183). Between 2007 and 2009, the United States saw a large increase in women's contribution to family income, resulting from a decrease in husband's earnings because three out of four eliminated jobs had belonged to men (Mattingly &amp; Smith, p.&amp;nbsp;344). Working wives also worked more hours if their spouses stopped working (Mattingly &amp; Smith, p.&amp;nbsp;355).

=== Criteria used to define “entering the workforce” ===
The equations typically used in studies on added worker effect consider a woman active in the workforce whether she is employed or actively seeking a job. Tim Maloney’s study found no evidence of the added worker effect when entering the workforce is unorthodoxly defined by gaining employment (1991). This example supports the finding that often women with frequently unemployed spouses look for work but fail to find jobs that would enable them to offset the loss in household income. Such was not the case during the Great Recession, when wives with unemployed husbands commenced work more often than during the preceding period of economic growth (Mattingly &amp; Smith, p.&amp;nbsp;351).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4230">'''Alaska Measure 2''' or the '''Alaska Marijuana Criminalization Initiative''' was a successful 1990 ballot measure in the U.S. state of [[Alaska]]; the initiative stated that it: "would change Alaska's laws by making all such possession of marijuana criminal, with possible penalties of up to 90 days in jail and/or up to a $1000 fine."

The legal status of cannabis in Alaska has varied greatly since the passage in 1972 of a [[constitutional amendment]] affirming an individual's [[right to privacy]]. Alaska had previously recognized that right to privacy with respect to possession and use of cannabis with the 1975 ''[[Ravin v. State]]'' case in the [[Alaska Supreme Court]]. The [[Alaska Legislature|state legislature]] then decriminalized marijuana in 1982.  The measure's passage in 1990 met with a variety of court challenges over the years before being struck down in 2003 by the [[Alaska Court of Appeals]].  Reversing the decision of this measure, Alaska voters ultimately legalized marijuana with a different [[Alaska Measure 2 (2014)|Measure 2]] in 2014.&lt;ref name="SchebII2013"&gt;{{cite book|author1=John Scheb|author2=John Scheb, II|title=Criminal Law and Procedure|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VZoWAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA300|date=19 February 2013|publisher=Cengage Learning|isbn=1-285-54613-X|pages=300–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opposition to the initiative was led by Alaskans for Privacy,&lt;ref name="apnewsarchive1990approve"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.apnewsarchive.com/1990/Alaska-Voters-Approve-Measure-to-Recriminalize-Marijuana/id-4db1bf97a3d7c3a94c1d1e304f149c06 |title=Alaska Voters Approve Measure to Recriminalize Marijuana |publisher=Apnewsarchive.com |date=1990-11-07 |accessdate=2015-04-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[National Organization for the Reform of Marijuana Laws]] (NORML) gave top priority to defeating the initiative, contributing "nearly $16,000" to opposition efforts by late September.&lt;ref name="apnewsarchive2"/&gt;

Polling across Alaska in August of that year showed a nearly 2-1 margin of support for the measure. Gubernatorial candidates, [[Arliss Sturgulewski]] (Republican) and [[Walter Hickel]] ([[Alaskan Independence Party]]) supported the initiative, while Democrat [[Tony Knowles (politician)|Tony Knowles]] supported criminalization but not incarceration for first-time offenders.&lt;ref name="apnewsarchive2"/&gt;

At the successful end of the campaign, Majewske announced:
&lt;blockquote&gt;''It's wonderful, I have great faith in the people of this state. I truly believed they would do the right thing. I think that this will say to people that the law didn't work, and we need to be looking in the other direction, toward a drug-free environment for our children. The only way to do that is to tell them it's illegal.''&lt;ref name="apnewsarchive1990approve" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4632">'''Ambient authority''' is a term used in the study of [[access control]] systems.

A subject, such as a computer program, is said to be using
''ambient authority'' if it only needs to specify the names
of the involved object(s) and the operation to be performed on them
in order for a permitted action to succeed.

In this definition,
* a "name" is any way of referring to an object that does not itself include authorising information, and could potentially be used by any subject;
* an action is "permitted" for a subject if there exists ''any'' request that that subject could make that would cause the action to be carried out.

The authority is "ambient" in the sense that it exists in a broadly
visible environment (often, but not necessarily a global environment)
where any subject can request it by name.

For example, suppose a C program opens a file for read access 
by executing the call:

  open("filename", O_RDONLY, 0)

The desired file is designated by its name on the filesystem,
which does not by itself include authorising information, so the program
is exercising ambient authority.

When ambient authority is requested, permissions are granted or denied
based on one or more global properties of the executing program,
such as its ''identity'' or its ''role''.
In such cases,
the management of [[access control]] is handled separately
from explicit communication
to the executing program or [[Process (computing)|process]],
through means such as [[access control list]]s associated with objects
or through [[Role-Based Access Control]] mechanisms.
The executing program has no means to [[reification (computer science)|reify]] the permissions
that it was granted for a specific purpose as [[first-class value]]s.
So, if the program should be able to access an object when acting on
its own behalf but not when acting on behalf of one of its clients (or, on
behalf of one client but not another), it has no way to express
that intention. This inevitably leads to such programs
being subject to the [[Confused deputy problem]].

The term "ambient authority" is used primarily
to contrast with [[capability-based security]] (including [[object-capability model]]s),
in which executing programs receive permissions
as they might receive data, as communicated [[first-class object]] references.
This allows them to determine where the permissions came from,
and thus avoid the [[Confused deputy problem]]. However, since there
are additional requirements for a system to be considered a capability system besides avoiding ambient authority,
"non-ambient authority system" is not just a synonym for "capability system".

Ambient authority
is the dominant form of access control
in computer systems today.
The ''user'' model of access control
as used in Unix and in Windows systems
is an ambient authority model
because programs execute
with the authorities of the ''user'' that started them.
This not only means that executing programs
are inevitably given more permissions
(see [[Principle of least privilege]])
than they need for their task,
but that they are unable to determine
the source or the number and types of permission that they have.
A program executing under an ambient authority access control model
has little option but to designate permissions
and try to exercise them, hoping for the best.
This property requires an excess of permissions
to be granted to users or roles,
in order for programs to execute without error.

'''Biology and political orientation''' is a concept based on a number of studies that have found that [[biology]] can be linked with political orientation.&lt;ref name=Jost2001&gt;{{cite journal|last=Jost|first=John T.|author2=Amodio, David M.|title=Political ideology as motivated social cognition: Behavioral and neuroscientific evidence|journal=Motivation and Emotion|date=13 November 2011|volume=36|issue=1|pages=55–64|doi=10.1007/s11031-011-9260-7|url=http://www.psych.nyu.edu/jost/Jost-Amodio-2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that biology is a possible factor in political orientation, but may also mean that the [[ideology]] a person identifies with changes a person's ability to perform certain tasks. Many of the studies linking biology to politics remain controversial and unreplicated, although the overall body of evidence is growing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nature.com/news/biology-and-ideology-the-anatomy-of-politics-1.11645 |title=Biology and ideology: The anatomy of politics |last=Buchen |first=Lizzie |date=2012-10-25 |website=Nature |pages=466–468 |language=en |doi=10.1038/490466a |access-date=2018-04-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Structural differences===
Recent research points at substantial differences in the cognitive styles of [[Liberalism|liberals]] and [[Conservatism|conservatives]] on psychological measures.&lt;ref name=JJ1&gt;{{cite journal|title= Political conservatism as motivated social cognition. |url=http://contracabal.com/PDF/Jost-1.pdf | author=J.

A 2011 study by cognitive neuroscientist [[Ryota Kanai]]'s group at [[University College London]] published in ''[[Current Biology]]'', found a correlation between differences in political views and differences in [[brain]] structures in a [[Accidental sampling|convenience sample]] of students from [[University College London]].&lt;ref name=RK&gt;{{cite journal|title=Political Orientations Are Correlated with Brain Structure in Young Adults |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0960982211002892 |author=R.

In addition, they found clusters in which gray matter volume was significantly associated with conservativism in the left [[insular cortex|insula]] and the right [[entorhinal cortex]].&lt;ref name=RK/&gt; There is evidence that conservatives are more sensitive to [[Disgust#Political orientation|disgust]]&lt;ref name=YI&gt;{{cite journal|title= Conservatives are more easily disgusted than liberals. |url=http://yoelinbar.net/papers/disgust_conservatism.pdf | author=Y.

The authors concluded that, "Although our data do not determine whether these regions play a causal role in the formation of political attitudes, they converge with previous work to suggest a possible link between brain structure and psychological mechanisms that mediate political attitudes."&lt;ref name=RK/&gt; In an interview with [[LiveScience]], Ryota Kanai said, "It's very unlikely that actual political orientation is directly encoded in these brain regions", and that, "more work is needed to determine how these brain structures mediate the formation of political attitude."&lt;ref name=Jost2001/&gt;&lt;ref name=HL/&gt;&lt;ref name=livescience&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.livescience.com/13608-brain-political-ideology-liberal-conservative.html | title=Politics on the Brain: Scans Show Whether You Lean Left or Right | publisher=[[LiveScience]] | accessdate=September 25, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYD&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.nydailynews.com/2011-04-08/entertainment/29415110_1_brain-structure-political-orientation-liberals-and-conservatives | title=The liberal brain?

===Functional differences===
A study by scientists at New York University and the University of California, Los Angeles, found differences in how self-described liberal and conservative research participants responded to changes in patterns.&lt;ref name=NN&gt;David M Amodio, John T Jost, Sarah L Master &amp; Cindy M Yee, [http://www.nature.com/neuro/journal/v10/n10/abs/nn1979.html Neurocognitive correlates of liberalism and conservatism], ''[[Nature Neuroscience]]''. Cited by [https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;q=%22Neurocognitive+correlates+of+liberalism+and+conservatism%E2%80%8E%22&amp;btnG=Search&amp;as_sdt=0%2C5&amp;as_ylo=&amp;as_vis=0 69 other studies]&lt;/ref&gt; Participants were asked to tap a keyboard when the letter "M" appeared on a computer monitor and to refrain from tapping when they saw a "W". The letter "M" appeared four times more frequently than "W", conditioning participants to press the keyboard on almost every trial. Liberal participants made fewer mistakes than conservatives when they saw the rare "W", indicating to the researchers that these participants were better able to accept changes or conflicts in established patterns. The participants were also wired to an [[electroencephalography|electroencephalograph]] that recorded activity in their anterior cingulate cortex, the part of the brain that detects conflicts between a habitual tendency and a more appropriate response. Liberals were significantly more likely than conservatives to show activity in the brain circuits that deal with conflicts during the experiment, and this correlated with their greater accuracy in the test. The lead author of the study, David Amodio, warned against concluding that a particular political orientation is superior. "The tendency of conservatives to block distracting information could be a good thing depending on the situation," he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://psychcentral.com/news/2007/09/10/brains-of-liberals-conservatives-may-work-differently/1691.html|title=Brains of Liberals, Conservatives May Work Differently|publisher=Psych Central|date=2007-10-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=LATimes2007&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/obituaries/la-sci-politics10sep10,0,2687256.story|title=Study finds left-wing brain, right-wing brain|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=2007-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an [[fMRI]] study published in ''[[Social Neuroscience]]'', three different patterns of brain activation were found to correlate with individualism, conservatism, and radicalism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Individualism, conservatism, and radicalism as criteria for processing political beliefs: a parametric fMRI study | pmid = 19562629 | doi=10.1080/17470910902860308 | volume=4 | issue=5 | year=2009 | pages=367–83 |vauthors=Zamboni G, Gozzi M, Krueger F, Duhamel JR, Sirigu A, Grafman J | journal=Social Neuroscience}} Zamboni G, Gozzi M, Krueger F, Duhamel JR, Sirigu A, Jordan Grafman.

==Genetic studies==

===Heritability===
[[Heritability]] compares differences in genetic factors in individuals to the total [[variance]] of observable characteristics ("[[phenotype]]s") in a population, to determine the heritability coefficient. Factors including [[genetics]], [[environmental factor|environment]] and random chance can all contribute to the variation in individuals' phenotypes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Raj | first1 = A | last2 = van Oudenaarden | first2 = A | year = 2008 | title = Nature, nurture, or chance: stochastic gene expression and its consequences | journal = Cell| volume =  135| issue = | pages =  216–26| doi = 10.1016/j.cell.2008.09.050 | pmid = 18957198 | pmc=3118044}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The use of [[Twin study|twin studies]] assumes the elimination of non-genetic differences by finding the statistical differences between [[monozygotic]] (identical) twins, which have almost the same genes, and [[dizygotic]] (fraternal) twins.&lt;ref&gt;[http://genepi.qimr.edu.au/contents/p/staff/CV190Martin_UQ_Copy.pdf A twin-pronged attack on complex traits], N. Martin, D. Boomsma and G. Machin. (1997). ''Nature Genetics'', 17, 387-92. 10.1038/ng1297-387&lt;/ref&gt; The similarity of the environment in which twins are reared has been questioned.&lt;ref&gt;Jon Beckwith and Corey A. Morris.

Gilbert, Gardner Lindzey. p. 372.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 twin study examined the attitudes regarding 28 different political issues such as capitalism, unions, X-rated movies, abortion, school prayer, divorce, property taxes, and the draft. Twins were asked if they agreed or disagreed or were uncertain about each issue. Genetic factors accounted for 53% of the variance of an overall score. However, self-identification as Republican and Democrat had a much lower heritability of 14%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2005/06/21/science/21gene.html?pagewanted=all | title=Some Politics May Be Etched in the Genes | publisher=''[[The New York Times]]'' | date=June 21, 2005 | accessdate=September 25, 2012 | author=Carey, Benedict}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Alford | first1 = J.

Jost et al. wrote in a 2011 review that "Many studies involving quite diverse samples and methods suggest that political and religious views reﬂect a reasonably strong genetic basis, but this does not mean that ideological proclivities are unaffected by personal experiences or environmental factors."&lt;ref name=Jost2001/&gt;

===Gene associations studies===
"A Genome-Wide Analysis of Liberal and Conservative Political Attitudes" by Peter K. Hatemi et al. traces DNA research involving 13,000 subjects. The study identifies several genes potentially connected with political ideology.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hatemi | first1 = P. K. | last2 = Gillespie | first2 = N.

==Physiology and behavior==
Persons with right-wing views had greater [[electrodermal activity|skin conductance]] response, indicating greater [[sympathetic nervous system]] response, to threatening images than those with left-wing views in one study. There was no difference for positive or neutral images. Holding right-wing views was also associated with a stronger [[startle response|startle reflex]] as measured by strength of eyeblink in response to unexpected noise.&lt;ref name=Jost2001/&gt; A study of subjects' reported level of [[disgust]] linked to various scenarios showed that people who scored highly on the "disgust sensitivity" scale held more politically conservative views.&lt;ref&gt;

==Evolutionary psychology==
From an [[evolutionary psychology]] perspective, conflicts regarding [[redistribution of wealth]] may have been a recurrent issue in the ancestral environment. Humans may therefore have developed psychological mechanisms for judging their chance of succeeding in such conflicts which will affect their political views. For males, physical strength may have been an important factor in deciding the outcome of such conflicts. Therefore, a prediction is that males having high physical strength and low socioeconomic stratum (SES) will support redistribution while males having both high SES and high physical strength will oppose redistribution. Cross-cultural research found this to be the case.

An alternative evolutionary explanation for political diversity is that it is a [[Polymorphism (biology)|polymorphism]], like those of gender and blood type, resulting from [[frequency-dependent selection]].  Tim Dean has suggested that we live in such a [[Pragmatic ethics#Moral ecology|moral ecosystem]] whereby the viability of any existing moral approach would be diminished by the destruction of all alternative approaches&lt;ref name=Dean2012&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Dean | first1 = T. | title = Evolution and Moral Diversity | doi = 10.4148/biyclc.v7i0.1775 | journal = The Baltic International Yearbook of Cognition, Logic and Communication | volume = 7 | year = 2012 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; (e.g. political balance promotes survival of the human species).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6394">'''Crachach''' ({{IPA-cy|ˈkraχaχ}}) is a pejorative term sometimes used to refer to members of [[the Establishment]] in [[Wales]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Davies|editor1-first=John|editor1-link=John Davies (historian)|editor2-last=Jenkins|editor2-first=Nigel|editor2-link=Nigel Jenkins|editor3-last=Baines|editor3-first=Menna|editor4-last=Lynch|editor4-first=Peredur|editor4-link=Peredur Lynch|title=[[Encyclopaedia of Wales|The Welsh Academy Encyclopaedia of Wales]]|publisher=[[University of Wales Press]]|date=2008|location=Cardiff|isbn=978-0-7083-1953-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''crachach'' are usually said to be [[Welsh language|Welsh-speaking]] and are said to be found in influential positions in the arts, politics, academia and the media.&lt;ref name="news"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hitt|first=Carolyn|date=1 March 2006|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/wales/4754896.stm|title=Just who are 'the crachach'?|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term 'Taffia' is sometimes used in a similar sense.

The use of the term ''crachach'' is considered to be offensive by some{{who|date=June 2018}}.

==Origins==
''Crachach'' in [[Welsh language|Welsh]] means 'petty gentry; conceited upstarts, snobs'. It is most common in the dialects of south Wales. ''Crachach'' is derived from ''crach'', which has the basic meaning of 'scabs (on the skin)' and a secondary meaning of 'snobs'.&lt;ref name="Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru"&gt;[http://geiriadur.ac.uk/gpc/gpc.html ''Geiriadur Prifysgol Cymru'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political use==
In English-language use it is often employed to suggest the existence of a small, usually Welsh-speaking elite whose interests are opposed to those of the majority of the Welsh people. Academic [[Richard Wyn Jones]] has argued that fear of such a supposed Welsh-speaking elite was characteristic of anti-devolutionists in the [[Welsh devolution referendum, 1979]]:

{{Quote|There was a perception amongst anti-devolutionists that devolution was some sort of plot by the establishment, by the crachach. Their [the anti-devolutionists’] idea that they were standing up for ‘the people’ was reinforced by 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spectre of the Taffia could still threaten hopes of a law-making Assembly|url=http://www.walesonline.co.uk/news/wales-news/spectre-taffia-could-still-threaten-2116134|accessdate=20 October 2014|publisher=Wales Online|date=5 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term is sometimes used in political discourse in Wales. As [[First Minister of Wales]], the Labour politician [[Rhodri Morgan]] stated that Wales would have 'Cynulliad y werin, nid Cynulliad y crachach' ('an Assembly of the people, not an Assembly of the ''crachach''').&lt;ref name="news" /&gt;

In 2010, Welsh Labour education minister [[Leighton Andrews]] criticized the Higher Education sector in Wales for not contributing to Welsh prosperity levels: 'For too many in Wales, higher education remains a distant, and irrelevant activity, clouded in mystery [...] It appears that higher education governance in post-devolution Wales has become the last resting place of the crachach.'&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|date=26 May 2010|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/10159512|title=Minister Leighton Andrews critical of universities|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Use in the media==
The term ''crachach'' is not uncommonly used in the English-language media in Wales, usually in a supposedly light-hearted vein.

An attempt to summarise the crachach, described as '[[tongue-in-cheek]]', was made by journalist Carolyn Hitt:{{Quote|Supremely confident in all social situations, you can spot them by their habit of looking over your left shoulder as they scan the room for someone more important than you to talk to. Older crachach can be fiercely Welsh nationalist yet not averse to receiving gongs from the Queen. Younger arty crachach will always get their projects funded, however rubbish they may be. [...] Crachach society is not a meritocracy. If the crachach had a coat of arms, the motto would be that old chestnut: 'It's who you know not what you know and make sure you're belonging to someone on the committee'.&lt;ref name="news" /&gt; }} She claimed that the ''crachach'' generally made their homes in [[Pontcanna]], [[Whitchurch, Cardiff|Whitchurch]] and the [[Vale of Glamorgan]].

In 1997, when then Welsh Secretary, [[William Hague]] MP, became engaged to marry a member of his staff, [[Ffion Jenkins]] (the daughter of the one-time head of the [[Welsh Arts Council]], Emyr Jenkins), Roger Dobson&lt;!-- Do not link to [[Roger Dobson]] (1954–2013). That is a different UK journalist --&gt; of the ''[[Independent (newspaper)|Independent]]'' wrote that Hague was marrying into the ''crachach''. He quoted Rhodri Morgan as saying of Ffion Jenkins, 'As far as the Crachach are concerned, she's marrying a commoner'. A nameless 'Welsh poet' was quoted as saying that 'The Crachach as we know it has really been built up over the last 30 to 40 years when the establishment of Wales has gravitated to Cardiff. It's a ruling elite, a lot of whom are related. When it comes to networking they make the Masons look like inadequates".&lt;ref name="independent"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/why-ffion-is-marrying-badly-1288697.html | title=Why Ffion is marrying badly |date=14 December 1997|work=|publisher=Independent (UK)|accessdate=16 September 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Term of abuse==
The term ''crachach'' is considered to be offensive by some, as it stigmatises a [[linguistic minority]], and suggests their involvement in a conspiracy of some sorts. [[Simon Brooks]] has written that ''crachach'' 'is best described as "hate speech" against those from a minority (i.e. Welsh-speaking) background who have the impunity not to be poor, and not to be bullied into giving up their own culture'. He notes that there are no equivalent terms for those of other backgrounds who hold influential posts in Wales.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Brooks, comment on '[http://syniadau--buildinganindependentwales.blogspot.co.uk/2010/06/crachach.html Crachach]', ''Syniadau: Ideas for Building an Independent Wales''. Accessed 18 April 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Labour MP [[Paul Flynn (politician)|Paul Flynn]] has called ''crachach'' 'a term of mild abuse'.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Flynn, ''Dragons Led By Poodles'' (London: Politico's Publishing, 1999), p. 73.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2275">Modern societies are confronted with communication problems caused by cultural misunderstanding and cultural contrast. Intercultural training tries to solve such problems by preparing personnel and private people for working abroad, dealing with migration or accomplishing projects in multinational teams.

An example for a cross-cultural communication strategy is "the contrast-American technique",&lt;ref&gt;DeMello, Cajetan, "Acting the Culture Contrast" page 59-68.

==Cross-cultural miscommunication==

According to Michael Walsh and [[Ghil'ad Zuckermann]], Western conversational interaction is typically "dyadic", between two particular people, where eye contact is important and the speaker controls the interaction; and "contained" in a relatively short, defined time frame. However, traditional Aboriginal conversational interaction is "communal", broadcast to many people, eye contact is not important, the listener controls the interaction; and "continuous", spread over a longer, indefinite time frame.&lt;ref name=Engaging&gt;{{citation|url=https://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|title=ENGAGING - A Guide to Interacting Respectfully and Reciprocally with Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander People, and their Arts Practices and Intellectual Property|author=[[Ghil'ad Zuckermann|Zuckermann, Ghil'ad]] et al|publisher=Australian Government: Indigenous Culture Support|year=2015|p=12|accessdate=25 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160330114112/http://arts.adelaide.edu.au/linguistics/guide.pdf|archivedate=30 March 2016|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Engaging/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=https://digitalcollections.anu.edu.au/handle/1885/47329|publisher=Australian National University, North Australia Research Unit|author=Walsh, Michael|year=1997|title=Cross cultural communication problems in Aboriginal Australia|pp=7–9|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''David Holmgren''' (born 1955) is an Australian environmental designer, ecological educator and writer. He is best known as one of the co-originators of the [[permaculture]] concept with [[Bill Mollison]].

==Early life==
Holmgren was born in [[Fremantle, Western Australia]] in February 1955, the second of three children. His parents Venie and Jack Holmgren were bookshop proprietors, activists committed to social justice, and former members of the communist party&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Childs |first1=Kevin |title=In praise of Venie Holmgren: at 92, still an activist, adventurer and poet |url=https://www.theguardian.com/books/australia-books-blog/2015/mar/25/in-praise-of-venie-holmgren-at-92-still-an-activist-adventurer-and-a-poet |accessdate=22 July 2018 |work=The Guardian (Australian edition) |publisher=The Guardian |date=25 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; who raised their children to question authority and stand up for their beliefs.&lt;ref name="DawbornSmith"&gt;{{cite book |last=Holmgren |first=David |editor-last=Dawborn &amp; Smith |title=Permaculture Pioneers, stories from the new frontier  |publisher=Melliodora Publishing |date=2011 |pages=18–29 |chapter=Chapter 2: The Long View |isbn=9780975078624}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Holmgren was dux of [[John Curtin College of the Arts|John Curtin High School]], but this remained unrecorded on the roll of honour due to his ‘dissident attitude’.&lt;ref name="DawbornSmith" /&gt; On completing high school he hitchhiked around Australia, before moving to Tasmania in 1974 to study at the Tasmanian [[College of Advanced Education]]'s Department of Environmental Design. In the [[alternative education]] environment there he chose to study landscape design, ecology and agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Permaculture One|last=Holmgren and Mollison|first=|publisher=Transworld Publishers|year=1978|isbn=0552980757|location=|pages=128}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Permaculture ==
Holmgren first met Bill Mollison in 1974 when Mollison spoke at a seminar at the Department of Environmental Design&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Holmgren |first1=David |title=A chance meeting |url=https://holmgren.com.au/a-chance-meeting/ |website=holmgren.com.au |accessdate=22 July 2018 |ref=A Chance meeting}}&lt;/ref&gt;. This led to an intense working relationship over the next three years, with Holmgren and Mollison sharing a house and garden, putting ideas into practice and collecting useful plant species. Holmgren wrote the manuscript for what would become ''Permaculture One: a perennial agricultural system for human settlements'' as he completed his Environmental Design studies, and submitted it as the major reference for his thesis. He then handed the manuscript to Mollison for editing and additions, before it was published in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mulligan |first1=Martin |last2=Hill |first2=Stuart |title=Ecological Pioneers: A social history of Australian ecological thought and action |date=2001 |page=203 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmgren’s development of permaculture ideas and practices were also strongly influenced by Haikai Tane, as well as the work of [[P A Yeomans]], [[Franklin Hiram King|F H King]], [[Howard T. Odum]] and [[Albert Howard]].

Holmgren initially concentrated his efforts on testing and refining his theories, first on his mother's property in southern [[New South Wales]] (''Permaculture in the Bush'', 1985; 1993), then at his own property, ''[https://holmgren.com.au/melliodora/property/ Melliodora], Hepburn Permaculture Gardens'',&lt;ref&gt;http://holmgren.com.au/melliodora/ Melliodora, Hepburn Permaculture Gardens, at Hepburn Springs, (http://www.holmgren.com.au)&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Hepburn Springs]], Victoria, which he developed with his partner, Su Dennett.&lt;ref&gt;Melliodora, ''Hepburn Permaculture Gardens – Ten Years of Sustainable Living'', 1996a; Payne, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;

He started his consultancy business Holmgren Design Services in 1983, designing and advising on a wide range of projects including:

*[[CERES Community Environment Park]], Brunswick, Vic  
*‘Millpost Farm’, Bungendore NSW&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Watson |first1=David |title=Millpost: A broad acre permaculture farm since 1979 |date=2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Watson Millpost: A broad acre permaculture farm since 1979

The publication in December 2002 of Holmgren's major work on permaculture saw a deeper and more accessible systematisation of the principles of permaculture refined by Holmgren over more than 25 years of practice. The book, ''Permaculture: Principles and Pathways beyond Sustainability'' (2002a), is dedicated to [[Howard T. Odum]], who died two months before its publication, and it owes much to Odum's vision of a world in energy transition.&lt;ref&gt;''A prosperous way down'', Odum and Odum, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

''Principles and Pathways'' offers twelve key permaculture design principles, each explained in separate chapters. It is regarded as a major landmark in permaculture literature, especially as the seminal work, Bill Mollison's ''Permaculture: A Designer's Manual'' (1988) was published fifteen years previously and has never been revised.&lt;ref&gt;http://transitionwhatcom.ning.com/profiles/blogs/principles-and-pathways-class&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmgren is a public critic of the land management orthodoxy of removing all non-native plants despite their ecological functions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://holmgren.com.au/spring-creek/#WillowWars | title=Willow Wars – Spring Creek Community Forest on Landline | date=June 2006 | accessdate=July 9, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Holmgren's interest in recombinant ecosystems or 'weedscapes' is partly inspired by a 1979 visit to New Zealand and interactions with New Zealand ecologist Haikai Tane (1995).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Mulligan, Dr. Martin, [[RMIT University]]|first=|editor=Professor Stuart Hill|title=Ecological Pioneers: A Social History of Australian Ecological Thought and Action|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vZ5pH6RmDDoC&amp;pg=PA205&amp;lpg=PA205&amp;dq=Haikai+Tane&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=XbV9_gwr1t&amp;sig=hMdMzfmRRfwlanIgcfEOK2xa2ww&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=5ONcUs63EqnQiAfR84Ao&amp;ved=0CF4Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=Haikai%20Tane&amp;f=false|accessdate= 15 October 2013|date=2001 |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]]|isbn=0521009561|page=205|chapter=Thinking like an Ecosystem: Australian Innovations in Land and Resource Management}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been shaped by Homgren’s interactions and experimentation at [https://holmgren.com.au/spring-creek/ Spring Creek Community Forest] where an informal network of locals manage a riparian forest of mixed native and non native species, with outcomes including increased recreational use and reduced fire hazard. The site has hosted guided tours and has been the subject of scientific research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilson |first1=M E |title=Organic Matter Dynamics in Willow and Eucalypt Lined Central Victorian Streams |date=2001 |publisher=Doctor of Philosophy thesis |location=School of Science, University of Ballarat, Victoria.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His ‘Weeds or wild nature: a permaculture perspective’ (2011) was published in [http://www.weedinfo.com.au/ppq_home.html Plant Protection Quarterly],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holmgren |first1=David |title=Weeds or wild nature: a permaculture perspective |journal=Plant Protection Quarterly |date=2011 |volume=26 |issue=3 |pages=92–97}}&lt;/ref&gt; and he wrote the foreword to Tao Orion’s [https://www.chelseagreen.com/product/beyond-the-war-on-invasive-species/ Beyond the War on Invasive Species].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Orion |first1=Tao |title=Beyond the War on Invasive Species: a permaculture approach to ecosystem restoration |date=2005 |publisher=Chelsea Green}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Future Scenarios ===
In 2007 Adam Grubb, founding editor of Energy Bulletin.net (now Resilience.org) published Holmgren's extended essay "Future Scenarios; mapping the cultural implications of Peak Oil and Climate Change" at futurescenarios.org, which established Holmgren as a significant [[futurist]] articulating and clarifying the [[Energy Descent]] concept.&lt;ref&gt;http://holmgren.com.au/product/future-scenarios/&lt;/ref&gt;

Influenced by the work of [https://www.theautomaticearth.com/tag/nicole-foss/ Nicole Foss], Holmgren’s more recent work has also taken into account the possible impacts of a global financial bubble burst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holmgren |first1=David |title=Crash on demand: welcome to the brown tech future |date=December 2013 |url=https://holmgren.com.au/crash-demand/ |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Retrofitting the suburbs ===
Holmgren argues that Australian suburbs can be effectively retrofitted for liveability, resilience and sustainability through strategies such as home food production and preservation, building retrofits and behaviour change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Holmgren |first1=David |title=RetroSuburbia: the manifesto |url=https://www.retrosuburbia.com/reading/retrosuburbia-the-manifesto/ |website=retrosuburbia.com |accessdate=9 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; An early version of these ideas, [http://www.raisethehammer.org/index.asp?id=175 'Retrofitting the Suburbs for Sustainability'], was published by the [[CSIRO]] in 2005&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Holmgren |first1=David |title=Retrofitting the suburbs for sustainability |journal=CSIRO Sustainability Network Update |date=31 March 2005 |issue=49E |pages=1–10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Holmgren created the fictional story 'Aussie St' to illustrate both the changes in Australian suburbs since the 1950s, and a possible resilient future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.retrosuburbia.com/resources/aussie-street-presentation-at-the-wheeler-centre/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His work on retrofitting the suburbs culminated in 2018 with the publication of [http://store.holmgren.com.au/product/retrosuburbia// ''RetroSuburbia: the downshifter's guide to a resilient future'']. The work is both a manifesto and a manual on how Australian suburbs can be transformed to become productive and resilient in an energy decent future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.retrosuburbia.com/book/}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is divided into three fields for action – the Built, the Biological and the Behavioral – and contains real-life case studies and an update of the Aussie St story.

== Major Projects ==
=== Melliodora ===

Holmgren’s home and major development site since 1986, “Melliodora” is a 2¼ acre property situated at the edge of [[Hepburn Springs]], central Victoria. It is one of the best documented and well known permaculture demonstration sites in the world. The passive solar house, mixed food gardens and orchards, dams and livestock, and creek revegetation in the nearby public land show how permaculture design can help restore and improve land, provide for residents’ needs and enjoyment in a cool continental inland climate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Melliodora – Hepburn Permaculture Gardens |url=https://holmgren.com.au/melliodora/property |website=holmgren.com.au |accessdate=22 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Fryers Forest Ecovillage ===

[[Fryers Forest]] [[Ecovillage]], near [[Castlemaine, Victoria|Castlemaine]], in [[Central Victoria]], Australia is a significant design and test of his permaculture principles.&lt;ref name="(En)Rich List"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://enrichlist.org/the-list/david-holmgren/#.VT6SyVr7K00 | title=David Holmgren | publisher=Post Growth Institute | work=The (En)Rich List | accessdate=April 28, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://simplelives.com.au/the-people-of-fryers-forest/ | title=The people of Fryers Forest | work=Simple Lives | date=May 10, 2012 | accessdate=April 28, 2015 | author=Greg Foyster | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://archive.is/20150427221037/http://simplelives.com.au/the-people-of-fryers-forest/ | archivedate=27 April 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
Recognition for Holmgren's contribution as an environmental designer, educator and activist has been slow to develop after the initial enthusiasm generated by the publication of ''Permaculture One'' when he was 23. The inclusion in ''Ecological Pioneers'' (of Australia)&lt;ref&gt;Mulligan &amp; Hill 2001&lt;/ref&gt; was the first substantial recognition by academic authors. The inclusion of a three part series on Melliodora in a best of ten years of ''[[Gardening Australia]]'', the most popular Australian TV gardening program, and a person profile on the Australian broadcast network program ''[[Landline (TV series)|Landline]]'' ([[ABC Television|ABC TV]] rural program) have been the most significant recognition by mainstream media. In 2012, following the publication of ''PP&amp;PBS'' in Italian, the environmental organisation Fondazione Parchi Monumentali Bardini e Peyron recognised Holmgren's contribution with the award Il Monito del Giardin.

In 2014, Holmgren was inducted into the Green Lifestyle Awards Hall of Fame&lt;ref&gt;[http://holmgren.com.au/green-lifestyle-awards/ Green Lifestyle Awards Hall of Fame]&lt;/ref&gt; for his pioneering and ongoing work with permaculture since he co-founded the concept more than three decades ago. He is in the good company of [[Bob Brown]], the inaugural inductee in 2012 and [[Olivia Newton-John]] in 2013.

In 2017 Holmgren was awarded an Honorary Doctorate from [[CQUniversity]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.cqu.edu.au/cquninews/stories/engagement-category/2017/milestone-event-for-permaculture-design-program&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==

Although ''Permaculture One'' was published by a mainstream publisher ([[Corgi (publisher)|Corgi]]) most of Holmgren's work has been self-published allowing experimentation with subject material such as case studies (''Permaculture in bush'', ''Trees on the treeless planes'' and ''Melliodora''), book formats (''Melliodora'' A3 landscape) and [[eBook]] formats (''Melliodora'', ''Collected Writings'') before their more widespread uptake, and Web publishing (''Future Scenarios''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.futurescenarios.org/ ''Future Scenarios'']&lt;/ref&gt;). This DIY approach reflects permaculture principles that encourage experimentation and self-reliance.

''The Essence of Permaculture'', a summary of ''PP&amp;PBS'', is the most translated work by Holmgren (available in 10 languages in 2015) while ''PP&amp;PBS'' is available in [http://www.kaicron.com.ar/paginas/ecologia/permacultura.htm Spanish], [http://livrariaviasapiens.com.br/site/index.php/permacultura-principios-e-caminhos-alem-da-sustentabilidade.html Portuguese], [https://web.archive.org/web/20160403100708/http://ariannaeditrice.it/vetrina.php?id_macroed=1645 Italian], Czech, [http://www.commonsonline.co.jp/perma%28jyou%29.html Japanese], [https://web.archive.org/web/20140410121215/http://www.ruedelechiquier.net/les-collections?view=bibliotheque&amp;id_collection=6 French], [http://borimbook.com/mall/m_mall_detail.php?ps_mode=search&amp;url=index.php&amp;ps_search=+%C6%DB%B8%D3%C4%C3%C3%B3&amp;x=0&amp;y=0&amp;ps_goid=568&amp;ckattempt=1 Korean] and [http://earthpassengers.org/prod_detail.php?info_id=192 Chinese].

{{Campaignbox Reconstruction Era}}

The '''Election Riot of 1874''', or '''Coup of 1874''', took place on election day, November 3, 1874, near [[Eufaula, Alabama]] in [[Barbour County, Alabama|Barbour County]]. [[Freedmen]] comprised a majority of the population and had been electing Republican candidates to office. Members of an Alabama chapter of the [[White League]], a [[paramilitary]] group supporting the Democratic Party's drive to regain political power in the county and state, attacked black Republicans at the polls. 

They killed at least seven and wounded 70, while driving away more than 1,000 unarmed blacks at the polls. In attacking the polling place in [[Spring Hill, Barbour County, Alabama|Spring Hill]], the League killed the 16-year-old son of a white Republican judge. They turned all Republicans out of office and declared the Democrats as winners.

==Background==
The [[White League]] had formed in 1874 as an insurgent, white Democratic [[paramilitary]] group in [[Grant Parish]] and nearby parishes&lt;ref&gt;"Parishes" in the State of Louisiana are administrative regions basically analogous to "Counties" in most other States of the United States of America.&lt;/ref&gt; on the [[Red River of the South]] in [[Louisiana]]. The League was founded by members of the white militia who had committed the [[Colfax Massacre]] in Louisiana in 1873, killing numerous blacks in order to turn out Republicans from parish offices as part of the disputed 1872 gubernatorial election. Historians such as George Rabe consider groups such as the White League and [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]] as a "military arm" of the Democratic Party. Their members worked openly to disrupt Republican meetings, and attacked and intimidated voters to suppress black voting. They courted press attention rather than operating secretly, as had the [[Ku Klux Klan]].

Chapters spread to Alabama and other states in the Deep South. A similar paramilitary group were the [[Red Shirts (Southern United States)|Red Shirts]], who originated in Mississippi and became active in the Carolinas. Both paramilitary groups contributed to the Democrats' regaining control in the state legislatures in the late 1870s. The Red Shirts were still active in the 1890s and were implicated in the [[Wilmington Insurrection of 1898]] in North Carolina.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.history.ncdcr.gov/1898-wrrc/report/Chapter3.pdf LeRae Umfleet, "Chapter 3: Practical Politics"], ''1898 Wilmington Race Riot Commission Report'', North Carolina Dept. of Cultural Resources&lt;/ref&gt;

==Events==
On election day, November 3, 1874, an Alabama chapter of the [[White League]] repeated actions taken earlier that year in [[Presidency_of_Ulysses_S._Grant#Vicksburg_riots|Vicksburg, Mississippi]]. They invaded Eufaula,  killing at least seven black Republicans, injuring at least 70 more, and driving off more than 1,000 unarmed Republicans from the polls.&lt;ref&gt;Mary Ellen Curtin, ''Black Prisoners and Their World, Alabama, 1865-1900,'' University Press of Virginia, 2000, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; The group moved on to [[Spring Hill, Barbour County, Alabama|Spring Hill]], where members stormed the polling place, destroying the ballot box, and killing the 16-year-old son of a white Republican judge in their shooting.&lt;ref&gt;Curtin (2000), ''Black Prisoners'', pp. 55-56.&lt;/ref&gt;

The White League refused to count any Republican votes cast. But, Republican voters reflected the black majority in the county, as well as white supporters. They outnumbered Democratic voters by a margin greater than two to one. The League declared the Democratic candidates victorious, forced Republican politicians out of office, and seized every county office in [[Barbour County, Alabama|Barbour County]] in a kind of [[coup d'état]].&lt;ref name="Curtin 2000 p. 56"&gt;Curtin (2000), ''Black Prisoners'', p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; Such actions were repeated in other parts of the South in the 1870s, as Democrats sought to regain political dominance in states with black majorities and numerous Republican officials. In Barbour County, the Democrats auctioned off as "slaves" (for a maximum cost of $2 per month), or otherwise silenced all Republican witnesses to the events. They were intimidated from testifying to the coup if the case went to federal court.&lt;ref name="Curtin 2000 p. 56"/&gt;

==Legacy==
Due to the actual and threatened violence by the White League, blacks began to stay away from the polls in Barbour County. They no longer voted in sufficient number to retain a majority of Republican officeholders. White conservative Democrats continued to intimidate black voters was through the late 19th century, especially after a Populist-Republican alliance elected some fusion candidates in the Deep South, as well as local Republican officials in many states.  

In 1875, [[Mississippi]] Democrats also used widespread intimidation to control local elections, which became known as the [[Mississippi Plan]]. Such violence was adopted by chapters in other cities and counties. Democrats regained control of Alabama and other state legislatures. Reconstruction ended with the withdrawal of federal troops as part of a compromise to elect [[United_States_presidential_election,_1876|Rutherford B Hayes]]

In 1901 the Democratic-dominated state legislature in Alabama, like other southern states, followed Mississippi's lead to end such election-related violence by passing a new constitution that effectively [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchised most blacks]] by such measures as [[poll tax (United States)|poll taxes]], [[literacy tests]], [[grandfather clauses]] and [[white primaries]]. Poll taxes and literacy tests also disfranchised tens of thousands of poor whites in Alabama. Although the Democratic legislature had promised whites would not be affected by the new measures, politicians wanted to preclude poor whites allying with blacks in Populist-Republican coalitions.&lt;ref name="Glenn Feldman 2004, pp. 135–136"&gt;Glenn Feldman, ''The Disenfranchisement Myth: Poor Whites and Suffrage Restriction in Alabama'', Athens: University of Georgia Press, 2004, pp.&amp;nbsp;135–136&lt;/ref&gt; With disfranchisement achieved, the legislature passed laws imposing [[racial segregation]] and other elements of [[Jim Crow]], a system that lasted well into the 1960s. At that time, the gains of the [[Civil Rights Movement]] led to Congressional passage of legislation in the mid-1960s that prohibited segregation and began to enforce the constitutional rights for minorities to suffrage and equal protection under the law.

In 1979, to commemorate the election riot, the state erected a historical marker located at the intersection of U.S. Highway 82 and Barbour County Road 49 near Comer, Alabama. It leaves much out of the account.

It reads:
:Near here is Old Spring Hill, the site of one of the polling places for the November 3, 1874 local, state and national elections. Elias M. Keils, [[scalawag]] and Judge of the City Court of [[Eufaula, Alabama|Eufaula]], was United States supervisor at the Spring Hill ballot box. William, his 16 year-old son, was with him. After the polls closed, a mob broke into the building, extinguished the lights, destroyed the poll box and began shooting. During the riot, Willie Keils was mortally wounded. The resulting Congressional investigation received national attention. This bloody episode marked the end of the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] domination in Barbour County. - Erected by the [[Historic Chattahoochee Commission]], 1979.

In '''''Federal Election Commission v. Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc.''''', 479 U.S. 238 (1986), the [[U.S. Supreme Court]] ruled that Massachusetts Citizens for Life, Inc. violated the [[Federal Election Campaign Act]] by distributing flyers asking voters to vote “for life” paid for with treasury funds. However, the court also ruled that the FECA section that required any spending by corporations on political campaigning to be done through [[political action committee]]s (PACs) was itself a violation of the [[First Amendment]] rights of nonprofit political and ideological groups.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | last = Wermiel | first = Stephen  | title = High Court Overturns Law Requiring Nonprofit Political Groups to Use PACs | newspaper = Wall Street Journal, Eastern edition | pages = 4  | date =16 Dec 1986 | via = ProQuest |url=https://search.proquest.com/docview/397987118/ |url-access=subscription | access-date = 2017-05-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.oyez.org/cases/1986/85-701|title=Federal Election Commission v.

In its modern form, a '''gated community''' (or '''walled community''') is a form of [[residential community]] or [[housing estate]] containing strictly controlled entrances for [[pedestrian]]s, [[bicycle]]s, and [[automobile]]s, and often characterized by a closed perimeter of walls and fences. Similar walls and gates have separated [[Quarter (urban subdivision)|quarters]] of some cities for centuries. Gated communities usually consist of small residential streets and include various shared amenities. For smaller communities, these amenities may include only a park or other [[common area]]. For larger communities, it may be possible for residents to stay within the community for most daily activities. Gated communities are a type of [[common interest development]], but are distinct from [[intentional community|intentional communities]].

Given that gated communities are spatially a type of [[enclave]], Setha M. Low, an anthropologist, has argued that they have a negative effect on the net [[social capital]] of the broader [[community]] outside the gated community.&lt;ref&gt;"Low, S (2001) The Edge and the Center: Gated Communities and the Discourse of Urban Fear, ''American Anthropologist'', March, Vol. 103, No. 1, pp. 45-58 Posted online on December 10, 2004." [http://www.anthrosource.net/Abstract.aspx?issn=0002-7294&amp;volume=103&amp;issue=1&amp;doubleissueno=0&amp;article=230068&amp;suppno=0&amp;jstor=False www.anthrosource.net]&lt;/ref&gt; Some gated communities, usually called guard-gated communities, are staffed by private [[security guard]]s and are often home to high-value properties, and/or are set up as [[retirement village]]s. Some gated communities are secure enough to resemble [[fortress]]es and are intended as such.

==Features==
[[File:Saskatoon gated community.JPG|thumb|A guarded, gated community located in [[Saskatoon]], [[Saskatchewan]], Canada.]]
[[File:Gated community near Ezeiza.jpg|thumb|A gated community near [[Ezeiza, Buenos Aires|Ezeiza]], a suburb of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]].]]
Besides the services of [[gatekeeper]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s, many gated communities provide other amenities. These may depend on a number of factors including geographical location, demographic composition, community structure, and community fees collected. When there are subassociations that belong to master associations, the master association may provide many of the amenities. In general, the larger the association the more amenities that can be provided.

Amenities also depend on the type of housing. For example, single-family-home communities may not have a common-area swimming pool, since individual home-owners have the ability to construct their own private pools. A [[condominium]], on the other hand, may offer a community pool, since the individual units do not have the option of a private pool installation.

Typical amenities offered can include one or more:

* [[Swimming pool]]s
* [[Tennis court]]s
* [[Community centre]]s or [[Club (organization)|club]]houses
* [[Golf course]]s
* [[Marina]]
* [[Restaurant|On-site dining]]
* [[Playground]]s
* [[Physical exercise|Exercise rooms]] including [[Exercise equipment|workout machines]]
* [[Spa]]

==Around the world==

[[File:Security spikes 1.jpg|thumb|right|Protective spikes in "security-zone" communities.]]
[[File:Gated community kinshasa.jpg|thumb|right|The inside of a gated community in Ngaliema, Kinshasa, DRC.]]

In Brazil, the most widespread form of gated community is called "condomínio fechado" (closed [[housing estate]]) and is the object of desire of the upper classes. Such a place is a small town with its own infrastructure (reserve power supply, sanitation, and [[security guard]]s). The purpose of such a community is to protect its residents from exterior violence. The same philosophy is seen on closed buildings and most shopping centres (many of them can only be accessed from inside the parking lot or the garage).

In [[Pakistan]], gated communities are located in big as well as small cities&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://m.zameen.com|title=Pakistan Property Real Estate - Sell Buy Rent Homes &amp; Properties In Pakistan Real Estate - Zameen|website=m.zameen.com|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and are considered standard of high quality living. [[Defence Housing Authority]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dhakarachi.org|title=Pakistan Defence Officers Housing Authority,Karachi|first=MIS Dte, DHA|last=Karachi|website=dhakarachi.org|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Bahria Town]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahriatown.com|title=Home - Bahria Town - Your Lifestyle Destination|website=bahriatown.com|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; are major private gated community developers and administrators and one of the largest in the world. The assets of [[Bahria Town]] itself are worth $30 billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bahriatowntoday.com|title=Bahria Town Today|website=Bahria Town Today|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most gated communities in Pakistan&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.citihousing.pk|title=HOME|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; have public parks, schools, hospitals, shopping malls, gymnasiums, and country clubs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ghar47.com/new-projects/|title=New Projects - Ghar47|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Argentina, they are called "barrios privados" (literal translation "private neighborhoods") or just "countries" and are often seen as a symbol of wealth. However, gated communities enjoy dubious social prestige (many members of the middle and upper middle class regard gated community dwellers as ''nouveaux riches'' or snobs&lt;ref name="Clarin"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.clarin.com/diario/2005/12/18/sociedad/s-05301.htm|title="Las viudas de los jueves", un retrato feroz y preciso de la Argentina|first=|last=Clarín.com|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;). While most gated communities have only houses, some bigger ones, such as [[Nordelta]],&lt;ref name="nordelta"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nordelta.com/ingles/inicio.htm|title=Nordelta|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; have their own hospital, school, shopping mall, and more.

In post-segregation [[South Africa]], gated communities have mushroomed in response to high levels of violent crime. They are commonly referred to as "complexes" but also broadly classified as "security villages" (large-scale privately developed areas) or "enclosed neighborhoods .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.gatedcomsa.co.za/docs/enclosed_neighbour.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120305113250/http://www.gatedcomsa.co.za/docs/enclosed_neighbour.pdf |archivedate=2012-03-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some of the newest neighborhoods being developed are almost entirely composed of security villages, some with malls and few other essential services (such as hospitals). In part, property developers have adopted this response to counter [[squatting]], which local residents fear due to associated crime, and which often results in a protracted eviction process.

They are popular in southern China, namely the [[Pearl River (China)|Pearl River]] Delta Region, the most famous of which is [[Clifford Estates]].

In Saudi Arabia, gated communities have existed since the discovery of oil, mainly to accommodate families from Europe or North America. After threat levels have increased since the late 1990s against foreigners in general and U.S. citizens in particular {{citation needed|date=January 2017}} gates have become armed, sometimes heavily, and all vehicles have been inspected. [[Marksman|Marksmen]] and [[Saudi Arabian National Guard]] armored vehicles appeared in certain times, markedly after [[list of terrorist attacks in Saudi Arabia|recent terrorist attacks]] in areas near-by, targeting people from European or North American countries.

Gated communities are rare in continental Europe and Japan.

==Criticism==
[[File:Retreat at Twin Lakes entrance.jpeg|250px|right|thumb|[[The Retreat at Twin Lakes]] is the location of the [[shooting of Trayvon Martin]].]]
Proponents of gated communities (and to a lesser degree, of [[cul-de-sac]]) maintain that the reduction or exclusion of people who would be only passing through, or more generally, of all non-local people, makes any "stranger" much more recognisable in the closed local environment, and thus reduces crime danger. Since only a very small proportion of all non-local people passing through the area are potential criminals, increased traffic should increase rather than decrease safety by having more people around whose presence could deter criminal behaviour or who could provide assistance during an incident.&lt;ref&gt;''Can Streets Be Made Safe?'' - Hillier, Bill; Bartlett School of Graduate Studies, University College London&lt;/ref&gt;

Another criticism is that gated communities offer a false sense of security. Some studies indicate that safety in gated communities may be more illusion than reality and that gated communities in suburban areas of the United States have no less crime than similar non-gated neighborhoods.&lt;ref&gt;Blakely, E.J., and M.G. Snyder (1998), [http://popcenter.org/problems/burglary_home/PDFs/Blakely&amp;Snyder_1998.pdf "Separate places: Crime and security in gated communities."] in: M. Felson and R.B. Peiser (eds.), Reducing crime through real estate development and management, pp. 53-70. Washington, D.C.: Urban Land Institute.&lt;/ref&gt;

A commentary in ''[[The New York Times]]'' specifically blames the gated communities for the [[Shooting of Trayvon Martin|shooting death of Trayvon Martin]] as the columnist states that "gated communities churn a vicious cycle by attracting like-minded residents who seek shelter from outsiders and whose physical seclusion then worsens paranoid groupthink against outsiders."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Benjamin|first1=Rich|authorlink1=Rich Benjamin|title=The Gated Community Mentality|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/30/opinion/the-gated-community-mentality.html|accessdate=23 October 2017|date=29 March 2012|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120401231201/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/03/30/opinion/the-gated-community-mentality.html|archivedate=1 April 2012|location=[[Internet Archive]]|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an influential paper, Vanessa Watson includes gated communities within a class of "African urban fantasies": attempts to remake African cities in the vein of Dubai or Singapore. In Watson's analysis, this kind of urban planning prizes exclusionary and self-contained spaces that limit opportunities for interaction between different classes, while worsening marginalization of the urban poor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Watson|first=Vanessa|date=2013-12-06|title=African urban fantasies: dreams or nightmares?|url=http://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/0956247813513705|journal=Environment and Urbanization|language=en|volume=26|issue=1|pages=215–231|doi=10.1177/0956247813513705|issn=0956-2478}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Common economic model types==
* Life-style — [[country club]]s, [[retirement community|retirement development]]s.
* Prestige — gates for status appeal
* [[Physical security]] communities — gates for crime and traffic.
* Purpose-designed communities — catering to foreigners (e.g. worker compounds in Mid-West Asia, built largely for the oil industry)

== Comparison to closed cities ==
The [[Closed city|closed cities]] of Russia are different from the gated communities.

* The guard duty in [[Closed city|closed cities]] is free to residents (paid by taxes)
* The public transport in [[Closed city|closed cities]] may go with transit checkpoints or checking passes/passports at technical stops and available to the others outside the security area. Within a gated community in the best cases, the bus stop is opposite the checkpoint, a few offer free buses. Via gated communities buses go due to easement or good will.
* Fares and communal payment in [[Closed city|closed cities]] are often equal (in all cases not greater) if it would be a common city. In gated communities service companies raise non legally fixed tariffs because it is difficult for those communities to negotiate lower terms.

==Examples==
{{Refimprove section|date=August 2010}}
A limited number of gated communities have long been established for foreigners in various regions of the world:

* The worker compounds in the Middle East, built largely for the oil industry.
* The Arbor Oaks [[Subdivision (land)|subdivision]] located in [[El Monte, California]], which appears in the film ''[[Back to the Future Part II]]'' as "Hilldale", is now gated because of the fans coming to see it in person. Residents are sometimes angry at fans who come by the development.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

===Argentina===
There are many gated communities in Argentina, especially in [[Greater Buenos Aires]], in the suburb of [[Pilar, Buenos Aires|Pilar]], 60&amp;nbsp;km N of [[Buenos Aires]] city, and in other suburban areas, such as [[Nordelta]].&lt;ref name="nordelta" /&gt; Tortugas Country Club was the first gated community developed in Argentina, dating from the 1930s/1940s, but most date from the 1990s, when liberal reforms were consolidated.

Since Buenos Aires has been traditionally regarded as a socially integrated city, gated communities have been the subject of research by sociologists. Gated communities are an important way through middle and upper-class people cope with the high levels of violent criminal activity in Greater Buenos Aires.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lanacion.com.ar/nota.asp?nota_id=1020924|title=Seguridad, un factor decisivo|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Australia===
Although gated communities have been rare in Australia, since the 1980s, a few have been built. The most well-known are those at [[Hope Island, Queensland|Hope Island]], in particular [[Sanctuary Cove]], on the [[Gold Coast, Queensland|Gold Coast]] of [[Queensland]]. Other similar projects are being built in the area. In [[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]], the first such development is [[Sanctuary Lakes]], in the local government area of [[City of Wyndham|Wyndham]], about 16&amp;nbsp;km south west of [[Melbourne]]. In [[New South Wales]], there is [[Macquarie Links]] gated community&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/National/Behind-the-urban-curtains/2005/03/03/1109700606439.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title=Behind the urban curtains | date=March 4, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Southgate Estate gated community. Many Australian gated communities are built within private golf courses.

In the ACT, the only example is Uriarra Village, based around community horse paddocks and dwellings jointly managed through strata title.

===Brazil===
[[File:Alphaville Barueri SP.jpg|thumb|[[Alphaville, São Paulo|Alphaville]], a gated community in the suburbs of [[São Paulo]], Brazil, which is also a [[Central business district|business center]] of its city proper, [[Barueri]].]]
Brazil also has many gated communities, particularly in the metropolitan regions [[Rio de Janeiro]] and [[São Paulo]]. For example, one of São Paulo's suburbs, [[:pt:Tamboré|Tamboré]], has at least 6 such compounds known as Tamboré 1, 2, 3, and so on. Each consists of generously spaced detached houses with very little to separate front gardens.

One of the first big-scale gated community projects in [[Greater São Paulo|São Paulo city region]] was [[Barueri]]'s [[Alphaville, São Paulo|Alphaville]], planned and constructed during the 1970s [[History of Brazil (1964–1985)|military dictatorship]] when the big cities of Brazil faced steep increases of [[Effects of the automobile on societies|car ownership]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,844667,00.html Middle-Class Wheels], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', December 6, 1968&lt;/ref&gt; by the middle and higher-classes, [[rural exodus]], poverty,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,942828,00.html A Decade of Ditadura], ''[[TIME Magazine]]'', March 25, 1974&lt;/ref&gt; crime, [[urban sprawl]], and downtown [[Urban decay|decay]].

===Canada===
Neighbourhoods with "physical" or explicit gating with security checkpoints and patrols are extremely rare, being absent in even some of Canada's richest neighbourhoods such as [[Bridle Path, Toronto]]. Furthermore, municipal planning laws in many Canadian provinces ban locked gates on public roads as a public health issue since they deny emergency vehicles quick access.

A noted exception in Canada is [[Arbutus Ridge Retirement Community|Arbutus Ridge]], an [[age-restricted community]] constructed between 1988 and 1992 on the southeastern coast of [[Vancouver Island]].

More common in most Canadian neighbourhoods, especially the largest cities, is an implicit or symbolic gating which effectively partitions the private infrastructure and amenities of these communities from their surrounding neighbourhoods. A classic example of this is the affluent [[Montreal]] suburb of [[Mount Royal, Quebec|Mount Royal]], which has a long fence running along its side of L'Acadie Boulevard that for all intents and purposes separates the community from the more working-class neighbourhood of [[Park Extension]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2001/110801/news3.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120701003952/http://www.montrealmirror.com/ARCHIVES/2001/110801/news3.html |title=Segregation fence to live on |author=Kristian Gravenor |archive-date=2012-07-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also, many newer suburban subdivisions employ decorative gates to give the impression of exclusivity and seclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gated-communities.de/Abstracts+New+Orleans.htm|title=research network: private urban governance "gated communities", "business improvement disctricts", "homeowner associations", "planned unit developments"|website=www.gated-communities.de|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
In China, some of these compounds, like most other gated communities around the world, target the rich. Also many foreigners live in gated communities in Beijing. Often foreign companies choose the locations where their foreign employees will live, and in most cases they pay the rent and associated costs (e.g. management fees and garden work).

Similar communities exist in Shanghai, another major Chinese city. Shanghai Links, an exclusive expatriate community enclosing a golf course and the Shanghai American School, is an example. Other notable gated communities in Shanghai include Seasons Villas, a development by Hutchinson Whampoa, Thomson Golf Villas, and Green Villas.

Other gated communities in China such as those in the [[Daxing District]] of Beijing enclose the homes of rural migrants. These are intended to reduce crime and increase public order and safety, which the [[Communist Party of China]]-run ''[[People's Daily]]'' claims it has, by 73%. The system is controversial as it segregates migrants and the poor, with some claiming its true purpose is to keep track of migrants, but it is scheduled for implementation in [[Changping District]] also.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/04/world/asia/04beijing.html "Migrant ‘Villages’ Within a City Ignite Debate"] article by Helen Gao in ''[[The New York Times]]'' October 3, 2010. Retrieved October 4, 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ecuador===
[[Guayaquil]] and [[Quito]], Ecuador have many gated communities. In the coastal city of Guayaquil, they are mostly located in [[Samborondón]] and in Quito in the valleys surrounding the city. They are home mostly for the wealthiest people, but there is a trend, specially in Guayaquil, of houses in gated communities with moderate prices as well.

===Egypt===
In [[Greater Cairo]], for example, there is [[Dreamland (Egypt)|Dreamland, Mountain View Egypt]], and in [[Alexandria]], there is [[Maamoura Beach, Alexandria|el Maamoura]].

===India===
In [[India]], there are many gated neighborhoods (also called "colonies" in [[New Delhi]]) in big cities where most of the upper middle-class and upper-class people live. New Delhi, [[Mumbai]], [[Chennai]], [[Bangalore]] and the like all have gated communities. Sometimes these communities are separated not just by wealth but also by ethnicity. Members of a particular ethnicity tend to feel more comfortable living among their own owing to reasons related to common festivals, language, and cuisine. Examples of this are common in New Delhi where there is a strong [[Punjabis|Punjabi]] community. Many gated neighborhoods are predominantly Punjabi and there have been cases of discrimination against members of other ethnic backgrounds living in those communities. Likewise, there also exist [[Bengalis|Bengali]], [[South India|South Indian]], [[Muslim]], and [[Gujarati people|Gujarati]] neighborhoods. Nowadays many modern gated communities are being developed like the [[Aamby Valley City]] and [[Lavasa|Lavasa City]] in [[Maharashtra]] occupying 100&amp;nbsp;square kilometers of area.
Now gated communities are being built in Chennai, [[Hyderabad]], Bangalore by a lot of real estate developers. In Bangalore, 3 locations are having community living those are Bannerghatta, Hebbal and [http://www.houseofhiranandani.com/devanahalli villas in Devanahalli]. As in neighboring countries, the target for these housing societies seem to be upper-middle or upper class citizens. Caste and religious discrimination is prevalent in the real estate industry. Several people have been denied homes based on their caste or religion regardless of this factor non-residential Indians are very interested in gated housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://profit.ndtv.com/news/real-estate/article-nris-showing-renewed-interest-in-indian-real-estate-hdfc-765597|title=NRIs Showing Renewed Interest in Indian Real Estate: HDFC - NDTV|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Indonesia===
In Indonesia, some gated communities are luxurious (with lots of up to 740 square metres (8000 sq ft)), and some are very affordable (with lots ranging from 40 to 120 square metres). From 2000, most of the new residential area build by private developer are gated community. Examples include [[Bumi Serpong Damai]] in [[South Tangerang]], Telaga Golf Sawangan and Pesona Khayangan in [[Depok]], and [[Sentul City]] in [[Bogor Regency]]. Gated communities in Indonesia still allow outsiders to use some of the facilities inside the community because there is a regulation that the social facilities in the residential development should be handed to the local government to be used by the public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last1=Asiz |first1=Rangi Faridha |title=Fenomena Gated Community di Perkotaan |date=2008 |publisher=[[University of Indonesia]] |pages=101 |url=http://lib.ui.ac.id/file?file=digital/125213-050821.pdf |language=id}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Italy===
Two examples of gated community in Italy are [[Olgiata]] in [[Rome]] and the village of [[Roccamare]], in [[Castiglione della Pescaia]], [[Tuscany]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Barbara Catalani|author2=Marco Del Francia|author3=Giovanni Tombari|title=Itinerari di architettura contemporanea.

In Malaysia, these are known as Gated &amp; Guarded Communities and have been seeing a steady increase in popularity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nst.com.my/red/gated-guarded-homes-trend-or-necessity-1.299819|title="Gated &amp; Guarded homes – trend or necessity?"|publisher=|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, according to the Town and Country Planning Department, there are four types of gated communities in Malaysia, namely:
# Elite community: this type of gated community is primarily occupied by the upper-class or high-income group of people. It focuses on exclusion and status in which security is one of the major concerns due to the resident’s status within the community.
# Lifestyle community: the lifestyle community generally consists of retirement communities, leisure communities and suburban ‘new towns’. Activities inside these communities can include golf courses, horseback riding and residents-oriented leisure activities.
# Security zone community: the security zone community is the most popular type of gated community in which it offers a housing development that is surrounded by fences or gates. This development is normally provided with guard services.
# Security zone community and lifestyle: this type of gated community housing development is usually developed within a city centre. It focuses on both the security aspect and the provision of lifestyle facilities for its residents.

The gated community is a concept that emerged in response to the rise of safety and security issues, and offers more advantages in terms of a calm environment and enhanced safety that is ideal for family development.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iproperty.com.my/news/6486/gated-guarded-boon-or-bane "Gated &amp; Guarded: Boon or Bane"] article by Rakesh Kumar in ''[[www.iproperty.com]]'' Mar 04, 2013. Retrieved November 25, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
Gated communities in Mexico are a result of the huge income gap existing in the country. A 2008 study found that the average income in an urban area of Mexico was $26,654, a rate higher than advanced regions like Spain or Greece while the average income in rural areas (sometimes just a short distance away) was only $8,403.{{citation needed|date=February 2015}} This close a proximity of wealth and poverty has created a large security risk for Mexico's middle class. Gated communities can be found in virtually every medium and large sized city in Mexico with the largest found in major cities, such as [[Monterrey]], [[Mexico City]] or [[Guadalajara]].

Luxury or "status" gated communities are very popular with middle to high income residents in Mexico. Gated luxury communities in Mexico are considerably cheaper than in countries such as the United States while retaining houses of similar size and quality due to the commonness of the communities and the lower cost to build them and are priced lower to attract middle class residents.

Many gated communities in Mexico have fully independent and self-contained infrastructure, such as schools, water and power facilities, security and fire forces, and medical facilities. Some of the larger gated communities even retain their own school districts and police departments.  The [[Interlomas]] area of Mexico City contains hundreds of gated communities and is the largest concentration of gated communities in the world, stretching over {{convert|54|sqmi|km2|order=flip}}. The surrounding areas of Santa Fe, Bosques-Lomas, Interlomas-Bosque Real, are also made up predominantly of gated communities and span over 30% of [[Greater Mexico City]].

Many smaller gated communities in Mexico are not officially classified as separate gated communities as many municipal rules prohibit closed off roads. Most of these small neighborhoods cater to lower middle income residents and offer a close perimeter and check points similar to an "authentic" gated community. This situation is tolerated and sometimes even promoted by some city governments due to the lack of capacity to provide reliable and trusted security forces.&lt;ref&gt;[http://uam-antropologia.info/web/articulos/goglia_gated_communities.pdf "Gated communities in Mexico City"] article by Angela Giglia Ciotta in ''Home Culture'' March 1, 2008.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, gated communities have been developed in suburban areas of the main cities since the 1980s and 1990s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.listener.co.nz/issue/3328/features/1508/my_home_my_fortress.html|title=New Zealand Listener - Noted|first=|last=Noted|date=|website=Noted|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/suburbs/7|title=7.  – Suburbs – Te Ara Encyclopedia of New Zealand|first=New Zealand Ministry for Culture and Heritage Te Manatu|last=Taonga|date=|website=www.teara.govt.nz|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pakistan===
[[File:Bahriatownvillas.jpg|thumb|Houses in Bahria Town Rawalpindi in [[Islamabad Rawalpindi metropolitan area]].]]
Pakistan has a very large number of gated communities, most of which target [[middle class]] Pakistanis. The largest being [[Bahria Town]], which is also the largest in [[Asia]] and has communities in major cities. [[Defence Housing Authority]] is also a major developer of gated communities.

Others include [[WAPDA Town]], [[Gulberg, Islamabad]] and [[Schon Properties]], while [[Emaar Properties]] also maintains several gated communities in the country targeting primarily [[upper class]] people. Gated communities in Pakistan are mostly immune from problems of law enforcement and lack of energy faced by the majority of the other housing societies. In a short time, the property prices in such communities have greatly increased &amp;ndash; in 2007 a 20-square-meter house in [[Bahria Town]], [[Lahore]] cost around four million rupees ([[$]]40,000); a similar property in 2012 costed nine million rupees, while houses are priced around 100-300 million rupees.

===Peru===
[[Lima]], Peru has several gated communities, especially in the wealthy districts of [[La Molina District|La Molina]] and [[Santiago de Surco]]. They are home to many prominent Peruvians. {{Citation needed|date=June 2011}}

===Philippines===
The [[Philippines]] has a sizable number of gated communities which are known in [[Philippine English]] as "subdivisions" or "villages". Regardless of their names, such communities may either form part of a larger [[barangay]] (village), or constitute a single barangay in and of themselves.

===Russia===
Aerobus live complex&lt;ref&gt;37.545196 55.807757&lt;/ref&gt; is the de facto first gated community in Moscow.  Business center is in this complex but outside the residential area.

===Saudi Arabia===
In Saudi Arabia, many expatriate workers are required to live in company-provided housing.  After the 2003 attack on Al Hambra, Jadawel, Siyanco and Vinell by militant Saudi dissidents,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/middle_east/riyadh/westerners_5-13.ht]&lt;/ref&gt; the government established tight military security for those compounds with large western populations.  Many western individuals also reside in the many other gated compounds or non-gated villas and apartments in the cities that they work.  Saudi Aramco provides a compound in Dhahran which is one of the largest of its kind within the kingdom.  Gated communities are also popular with many Saudis, which accounts for the limited availability of open villas in these communities and the premium rent paid for that housing.  These compounds can be found in many of Saudi Arabia's cities, including but not limited to Abha, Dhahran, Riyadh, and Taif.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatriates.com/classifieds/saudi/hs/|title=Saudi Arabia, Housing Available, 1, expatriates.com|website=www.expatriates.com|accessdate=16 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
South Africa has an increasing number of [[Crime in South Africa#Gated communities|gated communities]], often where the wealthy and enclosed live in close proximity to the urban poor (yet with little contact between the two).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lemanski|first=Charlotte|date=February 2006|title=Spaces of Exclusivity or Connection?

===Thailand===
Many housing estates in Thailand take the form of gated communities, targeted to the upper and middle classes. They may be managed by the development company or by resident committees. [[Land and Houses]], the country's largest real estate company, operates forty-three such developments alone. [[Nichada Thani]] in [[Pak Kret]] is a large gated community mostly serving expatriates.

Gated communities are often referred to as [[muban]]s in Thailand.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rentbangkokcondos.com/living-inside-moo-baan/|title=Living inside a Moo Baan|author=|date=25 April 2014|website=rentbangkokcondos.com|accessdate=16 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Turkey===
Turkey has several gated communities, especially in Istanbul and Ankara. Called "site" in Turkish, they are mostly located around the edge of the city.

===United Arab Emirates===
In the United Arab Emirates, gated communities have exploded in popularity, particularly in [[Dubai]], where the 2002 decision to allow foreigners to own freehold properties has resulted in the construction of numerous such communities built along various themes.  Examples include The Lakes, Springs, Meadows, and Arabian Ranches.

===United Kingdom===
In the [[United Kingdom]], gated communities are relatively rare. In 2004 there were an estimated 1,000 such communities in [[England]] (i.e. not including [[Scotland]], [[Wales]] and [[Northern Ireland]]). They are usually on a small scale: a gated street of up to 60 or 100 houses, or a single block of up to 500 or 700 flats. They can be found in London, for example, in the [[London Docklands|Docklands]] (such as [[New Caledonian Wharf]], Kings and Queen Wharf and [[Pan Peninsula]]) and [[East End of London|East London]] (such as [[Bow Quarter]] in [[Bow, London]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/programmes/if/3513980.stm|title=Gates and ghettoes: A tale of two Britains?|date=18 March 2004|accessdate=9 August 2017|work=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most gated communities in the US are unincorporated{{Relevance inline|date=April 2018}}: some, like Indiana's [[Briar Ridge]], may even span more than one incorporated municipality. However, there are numerous [[municipal corporation|incorporated]] gated cities in [[Southern California]], namely [[Bradbury, California|Bradbury]], [[Canyon Lake, California|Canyon Lake]], [[Hidden Hills, California|Hidden Hills]], [[Laguna Woods, California|Laguna Woods]], and [[Rolling Hills, California|Rolling Hills]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Communities Say Keep Out--by Bluffing |date=May 28, 2002|first=Evan |last=Halper|url= http://articles.latimes.com/2002/may/28/local/me-gated28|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; To meet legal requirements, the city halls and municipal facilities are public, and private corporations own parks and other facilities within the gates.

[[File:Brickell Key from north 20100211.jpg|left|250px|thumb|Brickell Key in Miami, FL, from the northwest is separated by water, requiring access by bridge]]

There are other incorporated gated communities outside California, including [[Lake Quivira, Kansas]], [[Sea Ranch Lakes, Florida]], [[Anderson Creek, North Carolina]], and [[North Oaks, Minnesota]].

[[Hot Springs Village, Arkansas]] is the largest gated community in the United States with over 26,000 heavily wooded acres. Hot Springs Village is governed by the Hot Springs Village Property Owners' Association (or POA for short), a private, tax-exempt home owners association. [[Harbor Springs, Michigan]] is the largest gated community in the Midwestern United States.

The village of [[Rosemont, Illinois]], just outside Chicago, maintains a security checkpoint at the entrance of its main residential section. [[Naval Square, Philadelphia|Naval Square]] was the first in the city of [[Philadelphia]], [[Pennsylvania]]. The neighborhood gives a suburban feel to an otherwise urban environment.

In [[Downtown Miami]], [[Miami, Florida|Florida]], the neighborhood of [[Brickell Key]] is a gated island community of [[high-rise]] residential towers. Although anyone can walk onto the island or come via the public bus, only authorized automobiles may enter. Brickell Key has some of the most expensive apartments in Miami.{{citation needed|date=July 2014}}

In 2012, the gated community [[The Retreat at Twin Lakes]] was made famous by the [[shooting of Trayvon Martin]] by [[George Zimmerman]] and has been in the national spotlight well into the year 2013 with the acquittal of Zimmerman.

'''Good Samaritan laws''' offer legal protection to people who give reasonable assistance to those who are, or who they believe to be, injured, ill, in peril, or otherwise incapacitated.&lt;ref name=dan&gt;[http://www.daneurope.org/c/document_library/get_file?uuid=c09228f3-a745-480b-9549-d9fc8bbbd535&amp;groupId=10103 DAN Legal Network: The Good Samaritan Law across Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; The protection is intended to reduce bystanders' hesitation to assist, for fear of being sued or prosecuted for unintentional injury or [[wrongful death claim|wrongful death]]. An example of such a law in common-law areas of Canada: a good Samaritan [[doctrine]] is a [[legal principle]] that prevents a rescuer who has voluntarily helped a victim in distress from being successfully sued for wrongdoing. Its purpose is to keep people from being reluctant to help a stranger in need for fear of legal repercussions should they make some mistake in treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianlawsite.ca/goodsamaritan.htm|title=What are good samaritan laws?|accessdate=2018-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; By contrast, a [[duty to rescue]] law requires people to offer assistance and holds those who fail to do so liable.

Good Samaritan laws may vary from jurisdiction to jurisdiction as do their interactions with various other legal principles, such as [[informed consent|consent]], parental rights and the [[informed refusal|right to refuse treatment]]. Most such laws do not apply to medical professionals' or career [[emergency responders]]' on-the-job conduct, but some extend protection to professional rescuers when they are acting in a volunteer capacity.

The principles contained in good Samaritan laws more typically operate in countries in which the foundation of the legal system is [[English Common Law]], such as Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Gulam H, Devereaux J |title=A brief primer on Good Samaritan Law for healthcare professionals|journal=Australian Health Review|volume=31|number=3|year=2007|pages=478–482|url=http://www.aushealthreview.com.au/publications/articles/issues/ahr_31_3_0807/ahr_31_3_478.asp}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many countries that use [[civil law (legal system)|civil law]] as the foundation for their legal systems, the same legal effect is more typically achieved using a principle of duty to rescue.

Good Samaritan laws take their name from a [[parables of Jesus|parable found in the Bible, attributed to Jesus]], commonly referred to as the [[Parable of the Good Samaritan]] which is contained in [[Gospel of Luke|Luke]] 10:29-37. It recounts the aid given by a traveller from the area known as [[Samaria]] to another traveller of a conflicting religious and ethnic background who had been beaten and robbed by bandits.&lt;ref&gt;Good Samaritan.

==Regions==

===Australia===
Most Australian states and territories have some form of good Samaritan protection.  In general, these offer protection if care is made in good faith, and the "good Samaritan" is not impaired by drugs or alcohol. Variations exist between states, from not applying if the "good Samaritan" is the cause of the problem ([[New South Wales]]), to applying under all circumstances if the attempt is made in good faith ([[Victoria (Australia)|Victoria]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bird|first=Sara|date=July 2008|title=Good Samaritans|url=http://www.racgp.org.au/afp/200807/200807bird.pdf|journal=Australian Family Physician|volume=30|issue=7|pages=570–751|accessdate=28 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Canada===
In Canada, good Samaritan acts fall under [[Province|provincial]] jurisdiction.  Each province has its own act, such as [[Ontario]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ontario.ca/laws/statute/01g02|title=Good Samaritan Act, S.O., 2001 (Ontario E-laws website)|accessdate=2015-07-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[British Columbia]]'s&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bclaws.ca/EPLibraries/bclaws_new/document/ID/freeside/00_96172_01|title=Good Samaritan Act [RSBC 1996] CHAPTER 172 (British Columbia Queen's Printer website)|accessdate=2008-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; respective Good Samaritan Acts,  [[Alberta]]'s Emergency Medical Aid Act,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qp.alberta.ca/1266.cfm?page=E07.cfm&amp;leg_type=Acts&amp;isbncln=9780779747214&amp;display=html|title=Emergency Medical Aid Act (Alberta Queen's Printer website|accessdate=2014-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nova Scotia]]'s Volunteer Services Act&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nslegislature.ca/legc/statutes/volnteer.htm|title=Volunteer Services Act 'Good Samaritan' RSNS 1989 (amend. 1992) (Nova Scotia Legislature website)|accessdate=2008-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Only in [[Quebec law|Quebec]], a [[Civil law (legal system)|civil law]] jurisdiction, does a person have a general duty to respond, as detailed in the [[Quebec Charter of Human Rights and Freedoms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Quebec Charter of Rights and Freedom|url=http://www2.publicationsduquebec.gouv.qc.ca/dynamicSearch/telecharge.php?type=2&amp;file=/C_12/C12_A.HTM|accessdate=2012-07-18|publisher=Éditeur officiel du Québec}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cangoodsam"&gt;{{cite web | title=Good Samaritan Law from The Canadian Association of Food Banks | url=http://www.cafb-acba.ca/english/GetInvolved-GoodSamaritanLaw.html  |accessdate=2008-10-20|publisher=Canadian Association of Food Banks (via Internet Archive) |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071217050919/http://www.cafb-acba.ca/english/GetInvolved-GoodSamaritanLaw.html |archivedate = 2007-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a typical Canadian law is provided here, from Ontario's Good Samaritan Act, 2001, section 2:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
Protection from liability

2. (1) Despite the rules of common law, a person described in subsection (2) who voluntarily and without reasonable expectation of compensation or reward provides the services described in that subsection is not liable for damages that result from the person's [[negligence]] in acting or failing to act while providing the services, unless it is established that the damages were caused by the gross negligence of the person. 2001, c. 2, s. 2 (1).&lt;ref name="ontgoodsam"&gt;{{cite web|title=Good Samaritan Act, 2001 ©Queen's Printer for Ontario, 2005 |url=http://www.canlii.org/on/laws/sta/2001c.2/20051114/whole.html |accessdate=December 26, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070213002307/http://www.canlii.org/on/laws/sta/2001c.2/20051114/whole.html |archivedate=February 13, 2007 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Yukon and Nunavut do not have good Samaritan laws.

===China===
There have been incidents in China, such as the ''[[Xu Shoulan v. Peng Yu|Peng Yu incident]]'' in 2006,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.danwei.org/law/common_sense_decency_and_crowd.php |title=A 45,000-yuan helping hand: common sense, decency, and crowded public transportation|last=Martinsen|first=Joel|date=7 September 2007|work=danwei.org|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/news/world/asia-pacific/ignored-toddler-doesnt-tell-the-whole-story-about-china/article2206105/|title=Ignored toddler doesn’t tell the whole story about China| date=19 October 2011|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; where good Samaritans who helped people injured in accidents were accused of having injured the victim themselves.

The [[death of Wang Yue]] was caused when the toddler was run over by two vehicles. The entire incident was caught on a video, which shows eighteen people seeing the child but refusing to help. In a November 2011 survey, a majority, 71%, thought that the people who passed the child without helping were afraid of getting into trouble themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/china/2011-10/28/content_23748172.htm|title=Youths search their souls after Yue Yue's death|date=2 November 2011|work=China.org.cn|accessdate=3 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''[[China Daily]]'', "at least 10 Party and government departments and organizations in Guangdong, including the province's commission on politics and law, the women's federation, the Academy of Social Sciences, and the Communist Youth League, have started discussions on punishing those who refuse to help people who clearly need it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2011-10/20/content_13941570.htm|title=Law mulled to make aid compulsory|last=Zheng|first=Caixiong|date=20 October 2011|work=chinadaily.com.cn|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Officials of Guangdong province, along with many lawyers and social workers, also held three days of meetings in the provincial capital of [[Guangzhou]] to discuss the case. It was reported that various lawmakers of the province are drafting a good Samaritan law, which would "penalize people who fail to help in a situation of this type and indemnify them from lawsuits if their efforts are in vain."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.latimes.com/news/la-mobile-china-toddler-death,0,362417.story|title=Chinese toddler's death evokes outpouring of grief and guilt|last=Demick|first=Barbara|date=21 October 2011|work=latimes.com|accessdate=23 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Legal experts and the public are debating the idea ahead of discussions and a legislative push.&lt;ref name="YueWSJ"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052970203752604576645033136435572|first=Josh|last=Chin|title=Toddler's Death Stirs Ire in China|date=October 22, 2011|accessdate=October 22, 2011|publisher=The Wall Street Journal}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 August 2013, the nation's first good Samaritan law went into effect in [[Shenzhen]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Huifeng | first = He | title = Shenzhen introduces Good Samaritan law | publisher = [[South China Morning Post]] | date = 1 August 2013 | URL = http://www.scmp.com/news/china/article/1293475/shenzhen-introduces-good-samaritan-law | accessdate = January 14, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 Oct 2017, China’s national Good Samaritan law came into force, Clause 184 in Civil Law General Principles.

===Finland===
The Finnish Rescue Act explicitly stipulates a duty to rescue as a "general duty to act" and "engage in rescue activities according to [one's] abilities". The Finnish Rescue Act thus includes a principle of proportionality which requires professionals to extend immediate aid further than laypersons.

The Finnish Criminal Code&lt;ref&gt;http://www.finlex.fi/en/laki/kaannokset/1889/en18890039&lt;/ref&gt; stipulates

"Section 15 - Neglect of rescue (578/1995)
A person who knows that another is in mortal danger or serious danger to his or her health, and does not give or procure such assistance that in view of his or her options and the nature of the situation can reasonably be expected, shall be sentenced for neglect of rescue to a fine or to imprisonment for at most six months."

===Germany===
In Germany, failure to provide first aid to a person in need is punishable under § 323c of [[Strafgesetzbuch|its criminal penal code]]. However, any help one provides cannot and will not be prosecuted even if it made the situation worse or did not fulfill specific first aid criteria. People are thus encouraged to help in any way possible, even if the attempt is not successful.&lt;ref&gt;{{de icon}} {{cite German law |link = stgb |para = 323c |defull=Unterlassene Hilfeleistung |en = Omission to effect an easy rescue | de = Strafgesetzbuch | deab = stgb |language=}}. {{en icon}} [http://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/englisch_stgb/englisch_stgb.html#p2729 English version].&lt;/ref&gt;
Moreover, people providing first aid are covered by the [[German Statutory Accident Insurance]] in case they suffer injury, losses, or damages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sozialgesetzbuch 7|location=§2, §13|url=https://www.gesetze-im-internet.de/sgb_7/index.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ireland===
The Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act of 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite Irish legislation |year=2011 |type=pub |number=23 |section=4 |name=Civil Law (Miscellaneous Provisions) Act 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; first introduced legislation specifically addressing the liability of citizen good Samaritans or volunteers in the Republic of Ireland, without introducing a duty to intervene.  This act provides for exemption from liability for a person, or voluntary organization, for anything done while providing "assistance, advice or care" to a person who is injured, in serious risk or danger of becoming injured or suffering from an illness (or apparently so). There are exclusions for cases of "bad faith" or "gross negligence" on behalf of the carer, and incidents relating to the negligent use of motor vehicles. This Act only addresses situations where there is no duty of care owed by the good Samaritan or the volunteer.

===Israel===
In Israel, the law requires anyone to assist a person in danger or at the very least call for help. People who help in good faith are not liable for damages. Helpers are eligible for compensation for damages caused to them during their assistance.

===Romania===
In Romania, the health reform passed in 2006 states that persons without medical training offering basic first aid voluntarily at the indications of a medical dispatch office or from own knowledge of first aid maneuvers, acting in good-will to preserve the life or health of another person cannot be held responsible under penal or civil law.

===United States===
All 50 states and the District of Columbia have some type of Good Samaritan law. The details of good Samaritan laws/acts vary by jurisdiction, including who is protected from liability and under what circumstances.&lt;ref&gt;The laws include: Maryland Courts and Judicial Proceedings Code § 5-603; VA § 8.01-225; NC § 20-166 and § 90-21.14; SC § 15-1-310; TN 63-6-218; GA § 51-1-29; Long list for 50 states: https://recreation-law.com/2014/05/28/good-samaritan-laws-by-state/ &lt;/ref&gt;

The 1996 Federal Emerson Act was intended to encourage donations of food and grocery products that meet quality and labelling standards imposed by federal, state and local laws and regulations, by protecting the donor and the recipient agency against liability, excepting in the case of gross negligence and/or intentional misconduct. Prior to passage of the Emerson Act differences in language and applicability between states often discouraged national and regional companies from donating, resulting in otherwise usable food being sent to landfills.

The 1998 Aviation Medical Assistance Act also provided coverage for "Good Samaritans" while in flight (Section 5b) &lt;ref&gt;AMAA,
 1998 https://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CRPT-105hrpt456/pdf/CRPT-105hrpt456.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===

In the common law of England and Wales there is no criminal liability for failing to act in the event of another person being in danger; however, there are exceptions to this rule. In instances where there has been an assumption of responsibility by the bystander, a dangerous situation was created by them, or there is a contractual or statutory duty to act, criminal liability would be imposed on the bystander for their failure to take action. The courts are reluctant to penalize people attempting rescue and English law makes provision for the actions of 'good Samaritans,' unless their actions were grossly negligent or made a situation worse.

==Common features==
=== Duty to Assist ===
In some jurisdictions, unless a caretaker relationship (such as a parent-child or [[doctor-patient relationship]]) exists prior to the illness or injury, or the "good Samaritan" is responsible for the existence of the illness or injury, no person is required to give aid of any sort to a victim. Good Samaritan statutes in the states of Minnesota and Vermont do require a person at the scene of an emergency to provide reasonable assistance to a person in need.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cprinstructor.com/VT-GS.htm|title=Vermont Good Samaritan Law|accessdate=2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.revisor.mn.gov/statutes/?id=604A.01&amp;format=pdf  604A.01 MINNESOTA GOOD SAMARITAN LAW]&lt;/ref&gt;  This assistance may be to call [[9-1-1]]. Violation of the duty-to-assist subdivision is a petty [[misdemeanour]] in Minnesota and may warrant a fine of up to $100 in Vermont. At least five other states, including California and Nevada, have seriously considered adding duty-to-assist subdivisions to their good Samaritan statutes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Help Your Neighbor—It’s the Law|url=http://www.ncsl.org/programs/pubs/399HELP.HTM|archive-url=https://archive.is/20070907234121/http://www.ncsl.org/programs/pubs/399HELP.HTM|dead-url=yes|archive-date=2007-09-07|date=1999-03-01|accessdate=2008-10-20|last=Lyons|first=Donna|publisher=''State Legislatures''}}&lt;/ref&gt; New York's law provides immunity for those who assist in an emergency.&lt;ref name="NY law"&gt;N.Y. Public Health L. §§ 3000-a, 3000-b, 3013 (McKinney 2000); see also [http://public.leginfo.state.ny.us/menugetf.cgi?COMMONQUERY=LAWS NY State Assembly website database of law]. Accessed July 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[public policy]] behind the law is:

{{quote|1=The furnishing of medical assistance in an emergency is a matter of vital concern affecting the public health, safety and welfare.  Prehospital emergency medical care, the provision of prompt and effective communication among ambulances and hospitals[,] and safe and effective care and transportation of the sick and injured are essential public health services.|3=N.Y.

Accessed July 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Imminent Peril ===
Good Samaritan provisions are not universal in application. The legal principle of [[imminent peril]] may also apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.essortment.com/all/goodsamaritanl_redg.htm |title=What is the Good Samaritan Law? (essortment website) |accessdate=2008-10-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081205022031/http://www.essortment.com/all/goodsamaritanl_redg.htm |archivedate=2008-12-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the absence of imminent peril, the actions of a rescuer may be perceived by the courts to be reckless and not worthy of protection. To illustrate, a motor vehicle collision occurs, but there is no fire, no immediate life threat from injuries and no danger of a second collision. If someone, with good intentions, causes injury by pulling the victim from the wreckage, a court may rule that good Samaritan laws do not apply because the victim was not in imminent peril and hold the actions of the rescuer to be unnecessary and reckless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/nation/2007-03-23-samaritan-accident_N.htm|title=Good Samaritan law may not apply (USA Today)|accessdate=2008-10-17 | date=2007-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See also, California Supreme Court decision in ''[https://cases.justia.com/california/supreme-court/S152360.PDF?ts=1323887050 Van Horn vs. Torti]'', December 18, 2008, with a similar fact pattern and limitation of protection to medical personnel rendering medical aid.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reward or Compensation ===
Only [[first aid]] provided without the intention of reward or financial compensation is covered. Medical professionals are typically not protected by good Samaritan laws when performing first aid in connection with their employment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://apps.leg.wa.gov/RCW/default.aspx?Cite=4.24.300|title=RCW 4.24.300 Immunity from liability for certain types of medical care (Washington State Legislature website)|accessdate=2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some states make specific provisions for trained medical professionals acting as volunteers and for members of volunteer rescue squads acting without expectation of remuneration.&lt;ref name="NY law" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.mesastate.edu/~jerry/gmnc/Colorado%20Good%20Samaritan%20Law.htm|title=Colorado Good Samaritan Law|accessdate=2008-10-17|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080723133002/http://home.mesastate.edu/~jerry/gmnc/Colorado%20Good%20Samaritan%20Law.htm|archivedate=2008-07-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Texas, a physician who voluntarily assisted in the delivery of an infant, and who proved that he had "no expectation of remuneration", had no liability for the infant's injuries due to allegedly ordinary negligence; there was "uncontroverted testimony that neither he nor any doctor in [[Travis County, Texas|Travis County]] would have charged a fee to [the mother] or any other person under the circumstances of this case."&lt;ref name="Texas law"&gt;''McIntyre v. Ramirez'', 109 S.W.3d 741 (Tex. Sup. Ct. 2003), overturning 59 S.W.3d 821 (Tex. Ct. of Appeals) and citing Tex. Civ. Prac. &amp; Rem. Code § 74.001 (effective in 1998, and since amended), found at [http://www.supreme.courts.state.tx.us/historical/2003/jun/011203.htm Texas Courts website].  Accessed July 25, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; It was significant that the doctor was not an employee of the [[attending physician]], but was only visiting the hospital and had responded to a "Dr. Stork" page, and had not asked or expected to be paid.&lt;ref name="Texas law" /&gt;

=== Obligation to Remain ===
If a responder begins rendering aid, he must not leave the scene until it is necessary to call for needed medical assistance, a rescuer of equal or higher ability takes over, or continuing to give aid is unsafe. This can be as simple as a lack of adequate protection against potential diseases, such as [[Polyvinyl chloride|vinyl]], [[latex]], or [[nitrile]] gloves to protect against blood-borne pathogens. A responder is never legally compelled to take risks to aid another person. The responder is not legally liable for any harm to the person assisted, as long as the responder acted rationally, in good faith and in accordance with their level of training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rolfsen ML |title=Medical care provided during a disaster should be immune from liability or criminal prosecution |journal=The Journal of the Louisiana State Medical Society |volume=159 |issue=4 |pages=224–5, 227–9 |year=2007 |pmid=17987961 |doi= |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Consent===

The responder must obtain the consent  of the patient, or of the legal guardian of a patient who is a [[minor (law)|minor]], unless this is not possible; failing to do so may attract a charge of [[assault]] or [[battery (tort)|battery]].

====Implied consent====
{{Main|Implied consent}}

Consent may be implied if an unattended patient is unconscious, delusional, intoxicated or deemed mentally unfit to make decisions regarding his or her safety, or if the responder has a reasonable belief that this was so; courts tend to be very forgiving in adjudicating this, under the [[legal fiction]] that "peril invites rescue" (as in the [[rescue doctrine]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.law.com/default2.asp?selected=904&amp;bold=|title=Implied Consent |accessdate=2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; The test in most jurisdictions is that of the "average, reasonable person". To illustrate, would the average, reasonable person in any of the states described above consent to receiving assistance in these circumstances is able to make a decision?

Consent may also be implied if the legal parent or guardian is not immediately reachable and the patient is not considered an adult.

====Parental consent====

If the victim is a minor, consent must come from a parent or guardian. However, if the legal parent or guardian is absent, unconscious, delusional or intoxicated, consent is implied. A responder is not required to withhold life-saving treatment (e.g., [[Cardiopulmonary resuscitation|CPR]] or the [[Henry Heimlich#The Heimlich maneuver|Heimlich maneuver]]) from a minor if the parent or guardian will not consent.{{Citation needed|date=June 2013}} The parent or guardian is then considered neglecting, and consent for treatment is implied by default because neglect has been committed. Special circumstances may exist if [[child abuse]] is suspected (the courts will usually give immunity to those first responders who report what they reasonably consider to be evidence of child abuse or neglect, similar to that given to those who have an actual duty to report such abuse, such as teachers or counsellors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Foltin GL, Lucky C, Portelli I, etal |title=Overcoming legal obstacles involving the voluntary care of children who are separated from their legal guardians during a disaster |journal=Pediatric Emergency Care |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=392–8 |date=June 2008 |pmid=18562886 |doi=10.1097/PEC.0b013e318178c05d}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Laws for first responders only====

In some jurisdictions,{{which|date=May 2012}} good Samaritan laws only protect those who have completed basic first aid training and are certified by health organizations, such as the [[American Heart Association]], or [[American Red Cross]], provided that they have acted within the scope of their training.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cga.ct.gov/lrc/recommendations/GoodSamaritanFiremansRuleFinalRpt.htm|title=Good Samaritan/Fireman's Rule |accessdate=2008-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these jurisdictions, a person who is neither trained in first aid nor certified, and who performs first aid incorrectly, can be held legally liable for errors made. In other jurisdictions any rescuer is protected from liability so long as the responder acted rationally.{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} In Florida, paramedics, EMTs, and Emergency Medical Responders (First Responders) are required by law to act under the Duty to Act law, which requires them to stop and give aid that falls within their practice.{{Citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Comparison with duty to rescue==
Good Samaritan laws may be confused with the [[duty to rescue]], as described above. U.S. and Canadian approaches to this issue differ.  Under the common law, good Samaritan laws provide a defence against torts arising from the attempted rescue. Such laws do not constitute a duty to rescue, such as exists in some civil law countries,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Higuchi N |title=[Good Samaritan Act and physicians' duty to rescue] |language=Japanese |journal=Nippon Hoshasen Gijutsu Gakkai Zasshi |volume=64 |issue=3 |pages=382–4 |date=March 2008 |pmid=18434681 |doi=10.6009/jjrt.64.382}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in the common law under certain circumstances. However, the duty to rescue where it exists may itself imply a shield from liability; for example, under the [[German law]] of ''[[Duty to rescue#Germany|unterlassene Hilfeleistung]]'' (an offense not to provide first aid when necessary), a citizen is obliged to provide first aid when necessary and is immune from prosecution if assistance given in good faith turns out to be harmful. In Canada, all provinces with the exception of Quebec operate on the basis of [[English Common Law]].  Quebec operates a civil law system, based in part on the [[Napoleonic Code]], and the principle of duty to rescue does apply.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadianlawsite.ca/goodsamaritan.htm|title=Canadian Law website 2|accessdate=2008-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in France anyone who fails to render assistance to a person in danger will be found liable before French Courts (civil and criminal liability). The penalty for this offence in criminal courts is imprisonment and a fine (under article 223–6 of the Criminal Code) while in civil courts judges will order payment of pecuniary compensation to the victims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Audrey Laur |title=Liabilities of Doctors on Aircraft |journal=Medico-Legal Journal |date=March 2013 |volume=81 |pages=31–35}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To illustrate a variation in the concept of duty to rescue, in the Canadian province of Ontario, the Occupational Health and Safety Act provides all workers with the right to refuse to perform unsafe work.  There are, however, specific exceptions to this right.  When the "life, health or safety of another person is at risk," then specific groups, including "police officers, firefighters, or employees of a hospital, clinic or other type of medical worker (including EMS)" are specifically excluded from the right to refuse unsafe work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.search.e-laws.gov.on.ca/en/isysquery/1b20e47b-33e4-49e7-a525-b268f053d236/4/frame/?search=browseStatutes&amp;context=|title=Occupational Health and Safety Act, R.S.O.

{{grading}}
'''Grading''' in [[education]] is the process of applying standardized measurements of varying levels of achievement in a course.
Grades can be assigned as letters (for example A through F), as a range (for example 1 to 6), as a percentage of a total number of questions answered correctly, or as a number out of a possible total (for example out of 20 or 100).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2005/j/sezioni/scuola_e_universita/servizi/studentissimi/magagnoli-premio/magagnoli-premio.html|title=Il liceale con la media del 9,93 "Sono il più bravo d'Italia"|author=Salvo Intravaia|website=repubblica.it|date=7 November 2009|language=italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some countries, all grades from all current classes are [[averaged]] to create a &lt;!-- "Grade point average" redirects here - this term is bolded per MOS:BOLD --&gt;'''grade point average''' ('''GPA''') for the marking period. The GPA is calculated by taking the number of grade points a student earned in a given period of time of middle school through high school.&lt;ref&gt;grade point average. (n.d.). WordNet2.0 Retrieved 3 October 2011, from Dictionary.com website: http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/grade point average&lt;/ref&gt; GPAs are also calculated for [[undergraduate]] and [[graduate school|graduate]] students in most universities. The GPA can be used by potential employers or educational institutions to assess and compare applicants. A '''cumulative grade point average''' ('''CGPA''') is a calculation of the average of all of a student's total earned points divided by the possible number of points. This grading system calculates for all of his or her complete education career. Grade point averages can be unweighted (where all classes with the same number of credits have equal influence on the GPA) or weighted (where some classes are given more influence than others).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Warne|first1=Russell T.|last2=Nagaishi|first2=Chanel|last3=Slade|first3=Michael K.|last4=Hermesmeyer|first4=Paul|last5=Peck|first5=Elizabeth Kimberli|title=Comparing weighted and unweighted grade point averages in predicting college success of diverse and low-income college students|journal=NASSP Bulletin|volume=98|pages=261–279|doi=10.1177/0192636514565171|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0192636514565171|accessdate=17 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==History==
[[Yale University]] historian [[George W. Pierson]] writes: "According to tradition the first grades issued at Yale (and possibly the first in the country) were given out in the year 1785, when President [[Ezra Stiles]], after examining 58 Seniors, recorded in his diary that there were 'Twenty ''Optimi'', sixteen second ''Optimi'', twelve ''Inferiores'' (''Boni''), ten ''Pejores''.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Pierson|first=George|year=1983|title=A Yale Book of Numbers. Historical Statistics of the College and University 1701 - 1976|chapter=C. Undergraduate Studies: Yale College|publisher=Yale Office of Institutional Research|chapterurl=http://oir.yale.edu/1701-1976-yale-book-numbers#C|place=New Haven|page=310}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bob Marlin argues that the concept of grading students' work quantitatively was developed by a tutor named [[William Farish (professor)|William Farish]] and first implemented by the [[University of Cambridge]] in 1792.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last = Postman|first = Neil|year = 1992|publisher = [[Alfred A. Knopf]]|place = New York|page = 13|title = Technopoly The Surrender of Culture to Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hoskin's assertion has been questioned by Christopher Stray, who finds the evidence for Farish as the inventor of the numerical mark to be unpersuasive.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Stray, "From Oral to Written Examinations: Cambridge, Oxford and Dublin 1700-1914", History of Universities 20:2 (2005), 94-95.&lt;/ref&gt; Stray's article elucidates the complex relationship between the mode of examination (testing), in this case oral or written, and the varying philosophies of education these modes imply, to both the teacher and student. As a technology, grading both shapes and reflects many fundamental areas of educational theory and practice.

==International grading systems==
Most nations have individual grading systems unique to their own schools. However, several international standards for grading have arisen recently.

{{Main|European Baccalaureate}}

== Grading systems by country ==
{{Main|Grading systems by country}}

===England and Wales===
In the General Certificate of Secondary Education ([[GCSE]]) exam taken by secondary school students in [[England and Wales]], grades generally range from 9 (highest) to 1 (lowest). However, in GCSE Science, Additional Science, Mathematics, Statistics, English Literature, English Language, and any Modern or Classical Foreign Language, there are two tiers (higher and foundation). In the higher tier, grades 9 to 4 can be achieved, while in the foundation tier, only grades 5 to 1 can be awarded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.edexcel.com/i-am-a/student/results/pages/results-gcse.aspx|title=Pearson qualifications - Edexcel, BTEC, LCCI and EDI - Pearson qualifications|website=www.edexcel.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, a 4 or above would be considered a pass and a 3 or below would be considered a fail by most institutions: for Mathematics and English Language and English Literature, and possibly Science, this would require a resit.

If an examined candidate does not score highly enough to get a grade 1, then he/she will be 'Unclassified'. This is often abbreviated to a 'U' as a final result.

===United States===
{{Main|Academic grading in the United States}}
Most colleges and universities in the United States award letter grades from F through A for each class taken. These marks are then used to determine an overall Grade Point Average (GPA) from 1.0 to 4.0, which is calculated using a formula.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fulbright.org.uk/going-to-the-usa/pre-departure/academics&lt;/ref&gt; The average GPA is 3.3 at private institutions, and 3.0 at public ones.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| last =Rampell| first=Catherine| title =Want a Higher GPA, Go to a Private College| newspaper =NY Times| location =New York| publisher =The New York Times Company| date =19 April 2010| url =https://economix.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/04/19/want-a-higher-g-p-a-go-to-a-private-college/ | access-date =20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over the past hundred years, various colleges, such as [[Evergreen State College]] and [[Hampshire College]] have begun to eschew grades. [[Ivy League]] university [[Brown University]] does not calculate grade-point averages, and all classes can be taken on a pass/fail basis. Additionally, several high schools have decided to forgo grades. A notable example is [[Saint Ann's School (New York City)|Saint Ann's School]] in [[Brooklyn]], which was ranked by the [[Wall Street Journal]] as the number one high school in the country for having the highest percentage of graduating seniors enroll in [[Ivy League]] and several other highly selective colleges.&lt;ref&gt;2 April 2004 ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'', Cover Story (Personal Journal)&lt;/ref&gt;

====GPA in the United States job market====
According to a study published in 2014, a one-point increase in high-school GPA translated to an 11.85% increase in annual earnings for men and 13.77% for women in the United States.&lt;ref name=HuffPost20140523&gt;{{cite web |last=Berman |first=Jillian |title=Female 'A+' Students End Up Making As Much As Male 'C' Students |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/23/gpa-income_n_5373078.html |publisher=''The Huffington Post'' |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Pptfw8qg?url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/05/23/gpa-income_n_5373078.html |archivedate=25 May 2014 |date=23 May 2014 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

College and post-college students often wonder how much weight their GPA carries in future employment. In the various broadly defined professions as a whole, [[internship]]s and [[work experience]] gained during one's time in college are easily the most important factors that employers consider. In order of importance, the remaining factors are choice of [[Major (academic)|major]], [[volunteering]], choice of [[extracurricular activity]], relevance of [[coursework]], grade point average and the reputation of one's college. The relative importance of these factors do vary somewhat between professions, but in all of them, a graduate's GPA is relatively low on the list of factors that employers consider.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | last =
 | first =
 | date =December 2012
 | website =[[The Chronicle of Higher Education]]
 | publisher =
 | access-date =6 November 2015
 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;
There is also criticism about using grades as an indicator in employment. Armstrong (2012) claimed that the relationship between grades and [[job performance]] is low and becoming lower in recent studies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url= https://marketing.wharton.upenn.edu/files/?whdmsaction=public:main.file&amp;fileID=8113 | title = Natural Learning in Higher Education|last=Armstrong |first=J. Scott | journal = Encyclopedia of the Sciences of Learning | year = 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[grade inflation]] that has plagued American colleges over recent decades has also played a role in the devaluation of grades.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
 | url =https://www.theatlantic.com/education/archive/2015/01/same-performance-better-grades/384447/
 | title =Same Performance, Better Grades
 | last =Katsikas
 | first =Aina
 | date =13 January 2015
 | website =The Atlantic
 | publisher =
 | access-date =5 November 2015
 | quote =Ultimately, grade inflation has severe consequences. Not only does it make it difficult for employers to vet the caliber of an applicant, but it also misleads students, who often use their grades as benchmarks to help diagnose their strengths and weaknesses. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
=== India ===
Different educational boards use different metrics in awarding grades to students, along with the marks obtained in most cases. &lt;br&gt;
For example, Kerala state board uses a linear scale; A+ for a mark over 90%, A for a mark between 80% and 90% and so on &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://kerala.gov.in/documents/10180/99657fdc-431e-43fa-a022-a45dfa873e6f | title=Notification for the Conduct of First and Second Year Higher Secondary Examinations March 2016 &amp; The Details of Other Higher Secondary Examinations Conducted in the Year 2016 | publisher=Government of Kerala, Directorate of Higher Secondary Education | accessdate=26 November 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==== CBSE ====
{{main|Central Board of Secondary Education}}

However, the national board [[Central Board of Secondary Education|CBSE]] uses ''positional'' grades to indicate a student's position with the rest of their peers in that subject, and hence the cutoffs required to obtain a grade will differ with year and subject; however, the percentage of students receiving them will roughly be the same.

The '''Howard League for Penal Reform''' is a [[registered charity]] in the [[United Kingdom]]. It is the oldest [[penal reform]] organisation in the world, named after [[John Howard (prison reformer)|John Howard]]. It was founded as the Howard Association in 1866 and changed its name in 1921, following a merger with the Penal Reform League. The charity focuses on penal reform in England and Wales.

The Howard League is independent of the United Kingdom government and is funded by voluntary donations and membership donations. The charity also receives funding from the [[Legal Services Commission]], as it holds Legal Aid contracts in order to perform its work with young people in custody.

The Howard League's Chief Executive is [[Frances Crook]], who joined the charity as Director in 1986.

The Howard League Centre for Penal Reform, the charity's headquarters since 2000, was officially opened by [[Betty Boothroyd]] in November 2001. The Centre is located in north London.

==History==
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://howardleague.org/about-us/|website=Howard League for Penal Reform|accessdate=24 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1921, the Howard Association merged with the Penal Reform League to become the Howard League for Penal Reform. The Penal Reform League had been founded in 1907 with Arthur St John as Secretary. The new organisation was led by [[Margery Fry]], who had been Secretary of the Penal Reform League since 1918.

In 2016, the charity celebrated its 150th birthday with activities including an international academic conference at [[Keble College, Oxford]], an exhibition in the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom]], and a Prison Diaries project, which involved people keeping diaries in prisons across the United Kingdom.

During its long history, the Howard League has had a significant impact on the development of [[criminal justice]] policy. It played a key role in campaigning for the abolition of [[capital punishment]]; advocated for the founding of the [[National Probation Service]]; and co-founded the [[Prisoners' Advice Service]]. The charity also successfully campaigned for the introduction of the victims' compensation scheme.

==Campaigns==

The Howard League campaigns for a society with less crime, safer communities and fewer people in prison. Its high-profile campaign successes include working with police to reduce the number of arrests of children; overturning restrictions on sending books to prisoners; and securing a suspension of the criminal courts charge. 

The charity has held inquiries to examine a variety of issues relating to the criminal justice system, including suicides in prison; sexual health in prison; and the imprisonment of former armed services personnel.

===Child arrests===

The Howard League campaigns for a reduction in the number of arrests of children in England and Wales.

Data published by the charity in 2016 showed that the number of arrests of children had fallen by 59 per cent in six years (from 245,763 in 2010 to 101,926 in 2015). The Howard League's Chief Executive, Frances Crook, said that the fall could be attributed to better use of resources, removing national targets, improving staff training, and support from communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Humberside Police 'most successful force' in reducing child arrests|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-37605403|accessdate=24 May 2017|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Books For Prisoners===

The Howard League's Books For Prisoners campaign was set up in 2014 to overturn restrictions on sending books to people in prisons in England and Wales.

The campaign was supported by another charity, [[English PEN]], and writers including [[Carol Ann Duffy]], the [[Poet Laureate of the United Kingdom]]; [[Mark Haddon]]; [[Sarah Waters]]; [[David Hare (playwright)]]; [[A. L. Kennedy]]; [[Alan Bennett]]; [[Salman Rushdie]]; [[Joanne Harris]]; [[Ian Rankin]]; [[Irvine Welsh]]; [[Nick Hornby]]; [[Ruth Padel]] and [[Philip Pullman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Green|first1=Chris|title=Top writers outraged at ban on books for prisoners|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/books/news/top-writers-outraged-at-ban-on-books-for-prisoners-9215424.html|accessdate=25 May 2017|publisher=Independent|date=26 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The campaign was successful. In December 2014, High Court judge Mr Justice Collins ruled that there was "no good reason" to restrict access to books for prisoners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Prison book ban ruled unlawful by High Court|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-30344867|accessdate=25 May 2017|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criminal Courts Charge===

The Howard League campaigned against the criminal courts charge, which required defendants who were convicted of a crime to pay fees ranging from £150 to £1,200 towards the cost of their case.

When the charge was suspended by the then Justice Secretary [[Michael Gove]] in December 2015, Howard League Chief Executive Frances Crook called the decision a "victory for justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Criminal courts charge to be scrapped by government|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-politics-34993428|accessdate=25 May 2017|publisher=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal work==

The Howard League has a legal team that helps children and young people in the criminal justice system. It provides a free and confidential advice line for prisoners under the age of 21.

The legal team also brings cases and conducts participation work to help shape the law and empower children to use their rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Legal work|url=http://howardleague.org/legal-work/|website=The Howard League for Penal Reform|accessdate=25 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Real work in prison==
The Howard League set up a graphic design studio called Barbed in [[HM Prison Coldingley]] in 2005.

The Howard League ran the business until it ceased trading in 2008. The charity later set up a Centre of Excellence to advise government and the private sector on how to implement real work for prisoners. The charity works with prisons, MPs, select committees, financial institutions and business leaders.

==Community Awards==

The Howard League runs an annual Community Awards competition to recognise successful community projects that encourage desistance from crime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Community Awards|url=http://howardleague.org/community-awards/|website=The Howard League for Penal Reform|accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Governance==

The Howard League's board of trustees is chaired by Eoin McLennan-Murray, a former prison governor who was appointed in November 2016. The previous Chair was Sue Wade, former deputy chief probation officer and youth justice manager in [[Hampshire]].

Former presidents of the Howard League include Lord [[Alex Carlile|Carlile]] QC and playwright [[John Mortimer|Sir John Mortimer CBE QC]].

The '''Irish Peace Institute (IPI)''' was established in 1984 by Dr. [[Brendan O'Regan]]. The Institute was created in order to promote peace &amp; reconciliation on the island of Ireland, and to draw on the experience of conflict resolution in order to learn lessons that could inform other conflicts.

The IPI is a charitable, non-governmental organisation based at the [[University of Limerick]] in the Republic of Ireland (CHY 6773). The mission of the Irish Peace Institute is to contribute to the process of peace-building through programmes of education, research and outreach directed to the development of mutual understanding and co-operation between the people of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. 

The IPI has contributed to peacebuilding in Ireland by promoting research, education and outreach through programmes of multi-track diplomacy and managed co-operation. These two terms were coined as a result of key initiatives set out by Dr. O'Regan in his early attempts to get people in the North and South of Ireland to begin a dialogue. The term [[multi-track diplomacy]] has been adopted by academics since its early use by Joseph Monteville at a conference on peacebuilding run by the IPI.

The IPI has a long track record of contributing to [[peacebuilding]] on the island of Ireland and has managed to contribute in a number of meaningful ways. The IPI pioneered cross-border networks between the peoples of Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It established the first Chair of Peace &amp; Co-operation Studies &amp; Peace Research Centre on the island of Ireland, and developed innovative projects in conflict resolution and conflict management.

The '''Italian Catholic Electoral Union''' (''Unione Elettorale Cattolica Italiana'', UECI) was a political organization designed to coordinate the participation of Catholic voices in Italian electoral contests. Its founder and leader was the Count [[Vincenzo Ottorino Gentiloni]].

==History==
The Catholic Electoral Union was formed in 1906 after the suppression of the ''[[Opera dei Congressi]]'' ("Work of the Congress") following the [[encyclical]] ''Il fermo proposito'' of [[Pope Pius X]].&lt;ref name='alberione'&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.alberione.org/operaomnia/stampa.php?recordID=92917 | title = Opera Omnia Alberione | accessdate = 2011-12-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was headed 1909-16 by Count [[Ottorino Gentiloni]]. The [[Gentiloni pact]] of 1913 brought many new Catholic voters into politics, where they supported the [[Liberal Union (Italy)|Liberal Union]] of Prime Minister [[Giovanni Giolitti]]. By the terms of the pact, the Union directed Catholic voters to Giolitti supporters who agreed to favor the Church's position on such key issues as funding private Catholic schools, and blocking a law allowing divorce.

The Gentiloni Pact was born out of a secret deal in the run-up to the 1913 general election between Catholic voters and Giolitti's Liberal candidates who promised to support Catholic policies, especially funding of Catholic private schools, and opposition to a law permitting divorce.&lt;ref name="Sarti2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=Roland Sarti|title=Italy: A Reference Guide from the Renaissance to the Present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xhoLorFC1iwC&amp;pg=PA308|date=1 January 2009|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=978-0-8160-7474-7|pages=308, 401}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was estimated that over 200 deputies were elected through the Pact, enough to provide a majority for Giolitti.&lt;ref name="Killinger2002"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles L. Killinger|title=The History of Italy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=stSxECsf0F4C&amp;pg=PA134|date=1 January 2002|publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group|isbn=978-0-313-31483-4|page=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Italian Socialist Party]] gained votes (from  19% to 23% of the voters) while the liberals were strengthened in the short run.  In the past, Giolitti had co-opted many moderate Socialists (as well as members of other fringe parties).  Giolitti himself was against political parties, which he felt were divisive and harmful to the "gentleman's game" of politics.

The Gentiloni Pact was condemned by Socialists and anti-Clerical allies of Giolitti.&lt;ref name="Sarti2009"/&gt;  They saw the Church as the bulwark to progress and felt betrayed into an alliance with Giolitti in the past.  The Socialists would never trust Giolitti or the liberal system again.

This led the revolutionary faction of the Italian Socialist Party to gain strength in Italy although the Vatican became increasingly influential in Italian politics as well.

Eventually, Giolitti was forced to resign by his anti-clerical allies in March 1914, and was replaced as Prime Minister by [[Antonio Salandra]] on appointment of the King.&lt;ref name="Sarti2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Killinger2002"/&gt;

== Biography ==
Coen was born in 1854 in a poor Jewish family. In 1864 he was apprenticed to a shoemaker. Sent by his master to deliver a pair of shoes at the house of a priest, the boy was seized and dragged to the Casa dei Neofiti, where he was detained for baptism. The papal authorities refused to surrender him, in spite of the protests of his father and of the Jewish community.

The affair caused a stir throughout [[Europe]], particularly in [[France]], the French ambassador, Count Sartigues, protesting vehemently in the name of his government. To his remonstrance the papal government replied that the child had himself determined to turn Christian, and that it was not the function of the pope to interfere with such a resolution. The pope, in examining into the case, is said to have asked Coen whether he embraced Christianity of his own free will. The boy replied that he preferred a religion which provided him with fine clothes, good food, and plenty of toys, to his poor family and the shoemaker's shop. This reply convinced the pope of the sincerity of the convert's intentions; and accordingly, on St. Michael's Day, Sept. 29, 1864, the baptism of Coen was celebrated in St. Stanislaus Chapel, Cardinal Caggiano officiating, and Count De Maistre being godfather. The neophyte received the name of Stanislaus Maria Michael Joseph Pius Eugenio.

The sufferings of Coen's family, caused by his capture, were excessive. His eighteen-year-old sister died as a result of the excitement; his mother became insane and was taken to relatives in Leghorn; and his father had to leave Rome in order to escape the persecution of the government. Another Jew was thrown into prison because he said he had seen Coen at the window of the Casa. Moreover, as a result of the affair, a Christian mechanic caused the forcible baptism of an eight-year-old Jewish boy.

It was only on the fall of the papal government in 1870, and after energetic measures had been taken by the Italian government, that Coen was released and restored to his mother in Leghorn, his forcible detention having extended over seven years. His life after that is unknown.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7727">'''President Jimmy Carter's Moral Equivalent of War Speech''' was a speech in which [[President of the United States|United States President]] [[Jimmy Carter]] addressed the United States on April 18, 1977.

[[Image:JimmyCarterPortrait.jpg|thumb]]

It is remembered as the speech where he compared the [[1979 oil crisis|energy crisis]] with the "moral equivalent of war".

Carter gave 10 principles for the plan, but did not list specific actions.  He said the goal was to reduce dependence on oil imports and "cut in half the portion of United States oil which is imported, from a potential level of 16 million barrels to six million barrels a day."

The phrase has become so well known, it is referenced in literature.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PLP5U-M8dhoC&amp;pg=PA459&amp;lpg=PA459&amp;dq=carter+moral+equivalent+of+war&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=7tw_df33yE&amp;sig=58UPoiMo2OjAkJidCcvUzv4FlhM&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_HqsSrnfMofKsQOJ56n3BA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10#v=onepage&amp;q=carter%20moral%20equivalent%20of%20war&amp;f=false America - The Last Best Hope]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=Hyg-AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=carter+moral+equivalent+of+war&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=B6_w-6fPzO&amp;sig=OQ3fA5mM4nuXe_VWrEh16N3OOr0&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=JnusSufLGI6ysgO5y9yOBQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=10#v=onepage&amp;q=carter%20moral%20equivalent%20of%20war&amp;f=false Transport Planning, Vision and Practice]&lt;/ref&gt; Carter used this phrase from the classic essay "The Moral Equivalent of War" derived from the speech given by American psychologist and philosopher [[William James]],  delivered at Stanford University in 1906, and subsequent book, published in 1910, in which "James considered one of the classic problems of politics: how to sustain political unity and civic virtue in the absence of war or a credible threat..." and "...sounds a rallying cry for service in the interests of the individual and the nation."  Ideas mirrored in much of Carter's philosophy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/wj/meow_intro.htm William James' The Moral Equivalent of War Introduction by John Roland]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.constitution.org/wj/meow.htm William James' The Moral Equivalent of War - 1906]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=FbA3AVrFkTUC&amp;pg=PA519&amp;dq=james+moral+equivalent William James' The Moral Equivalent of War in Representative Essays in Modern Thought]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Speech==
{{Wikisource|President Carter's Address to the Nation on Proposed National Energy Policy|President Carter's Address to the Nation on Proposed National Energy Policy}}
Carter noted that the energy crisis was likely to progressively worsen and could result in a national catastrophe.  He cited the effort was the "moral equivalent of war".

He cited historical energy changes from wood to coal then oil.  He foresaw the renewed use of coal and [[solar power]].  Our consumption of oil would keep going up every year. Our cars would continue to be too large and inefficient. Three-quarters of them would continue to carry only one person—the driver—while our [[Public transport|public transportation system]] continues to decline. He predicted that by 1985, [[Energy|energy use]] would increase by 33 percent.

He predicted that $550 billion would be spent on imported oil by 1985, up from $37 billion at the time of the speech and $3.7 billion six year earlier.

10 principles were introduced:

*the country can have an effective and comprehensive [[energy policy]] only if the government takes responsibility for it and if the people understand the seriousness of the challenge and are willing to make sacrifices.
*healthy [[economic growth]] must continue. Only by saving energy can we maintain our [[standard of living]] and keep our people at work. An effective conservation program will create hundreds of thousands of new jobs.
*must protect the environment. Our energy problems have the same cause as our environmental problems—wasteful use of resources. Conservation helps us solve both at once.
*must reduce our vulnerability to potentially devastating embargoes. We can protect ourselves from uncertain supplies by reducing our demand for oil, making the most of our abundant resources such as coal, and developing a [[strategic Petroleum Reserve (United States)|strategic petroleum reserve]].
*must ask equal sacrifices from every region, every class of people, every [[interest group]]. Industry will have to do its part to conserve, just as the consumers will. The energy producers deserve fair treatment, but we will not let the oil companies profiteer.
*the cornerstone of our policy, is to reduce the demand through conservation. Our emphasis on conservation is a clear difference between this plan and others which merely encouraged crash production efforts. Conservation is the quickest, cheapest, most practical source of energy. Conservation is the only way we can buy a barrel of oil for a few dollars. It costs about $13 to waste it.
*prices should generally reflect the true replacement costs of energy. We are only cheating ourselves if we make energy artificially cheap and use more than we can really afford.
*government policies must be predictable and certain. Both consumers and producers need policies they can count on so they can plan ahead. This is one reason I am working with the Congress to create a new [[United States Department of Energy|Department of Energy]], to replace more than 50 different agencies that now have some control over energy.
*must conserve the fuels that are scarcest and make the most of those that are more plentiful. We can't continue to use oil and gas for 75 percent of our consumption when they make up seven percent of our domestic reserves. We need to shift to plentiful coal while taking care to protect the environment, and to apply stricter [[safety standards]] to nuclear energy.
*must start now to develop the new, unconventional sources of energy we will rely on in the next century.

Goals we set for 1985:

--Reduce the annual growth rate in our [[Domestic energy consumption|energy demand]] to less than two percent.

--Reduce gasoline consumption by ten percent below its current level.

--Cut in half the portion of United States oil which is imported, from a potential level of {{convert|16|Moilbbl|m3}} to {{convert|6|Moilbbl/d|m3/d}}.

--Establish a strategic petroleum reserve of one billion barrels, more than six months' supply.

--Increase our coal production by about two thirds to more than 1 billion tons a year.

--Insulate 90 percent of American homes and all new buildings.

--Use solar energy in more than two and one-half million houses.

Those who insist on driving large, unnecessarily powerful cars must expect to pay more for that luxury.

'''Multiracialism''' is an [[ideology]] which aims to acknowledge that most societies are composed of people from more than one [[Race (human categorization)|race]], [[cultural]] background, [[ethnicity]], [[language]], [[phenotype]], [[religion]], or [[tradition]], while seeking to avoid supporting the policies and ideology associated with [[Multiculturalism]].

Multiracial describes people whose ancestry is composed of two or more racial categories such as Black (subsaharan Africa, black American, parts of India, New Zealand, Melanesia), East Asian (Chinese, Korean, etc), South Asian (Malay, Filipino, Tamil, etc), Indigenous American (North, Central, South) white (European, White Latinx or Arab) or others as defined by region.

Multiethnic/Multicultural describes people whose cultural heritage is composed of or influenced by people of differing languages, geographies, practices and norms. Multiethnic/cultural people can be of a singular race (ex: Black person who has one American parent and one African parent) or multiple races as described above.

==Examples==
Countries such as [[Malaysia]], [[South Africa]], [[Singapore]], [[Nigeria]], [[Brazil]], [[the United States]], [[Canada]], and [[Israel]] are examples of societies that contain diverse multi-ethnic and multi-racial populations.

==History==
In the United States, the [[List of United States federal agencies|federal agency]], or [[Office of Management &amp; Budget]] are the ones who determine racial and ethnic classifications.{{fact|date=July 2012}} Examples of racial groups in the United States: [[White American|White]], [[Black American|Black]], [[Native Americans in the United States|American Indian]] or [[Alaskan Native]], [[Asian American|Asian]] or [[Pacific Islander]] and Hispanic. In the 1960s and 1970s, the [[Bureau of Census]] adopted its racial classification scheme that showed that approximately 10 percent of Americans considered themselves non-white, and of that group, nearly all considered themselves as black.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://scholar.google.com/scholar?hl=en&amp;lr=&amp;q=info:W_vuXtWhwNQJ:scholar.google.com/&amp;output=viewport|title=Google Scholar|website=scholar.google.com|access-date=2016-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then, things have changed such as the notion of race due to an increase in [[interracial marriage|intermarriage]], and an increase in the growth of the Asian American and [[multiethnic]] [[Latino American]] populations. This resulted in one out of four Americans considering themselves White, Black, Asian, and/or Latino American.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

===Racial classification in America===
From 1790 to 1990, the classification of racial categories changed and so did the nation’s [[demographics]]. There were two premises that the government instilled upon Americans. “First it makes policy sense to put every American into one and only one of a limited number of discrete race groups, with the decennial census being a primary vehicle by which the counting and classifying should take place. Second, when policy treats Americans differently depending on what race they belong to, it should make use of this government classification.”&lt;ref&gt;http://search.proquest.com/docview/210567847&lt;/ref&gt; Policies such as who can vote, buy alcohol, own property be drafted, and so on since 1970 have always had set boundaries and little dispute. However, racial categories have not been as straightforward. From 1977, the government tried to better the countries racial categories but had some revisions along the way. It was not until 2000 that the U.S. census was the first to allow respondents to record numerous racial classifications.

==Debate over a multiracial background==
The [[motivation]]al basis for this [[behavior]] is varied, starting from [[socialization]], private [[philosophy]], to, [[Sexual orientation]], [[biology|biological]] ([[pheromones|phenomenal]]). Throughout history, there have been mixed marriages, and unions, occurring between different racial and ethnic groups. Before 1970, it was less likely for interracial marriages to occur and most people wanted to marry within their group. However [[miscegenation]] has long occurred within the individual races due to slavery, the inadequacy of race labels applied by the [[United States Census]] and covert common law marriages. Throughout the past thirty years, interracial marriages have tripled.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0wAb4rL4AHEC|title=The Politics of Multiracialism: Challenging Racial Thinking|last=Dalmage|first=Heather M.|date=2004-06-23|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9780791461549|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are many advantages and disadvantages to growing up with a multiracial background. Children growing up in a multiracial family can sometimes face issues with identity formulation and classification. An important aspect in the lives of multiracial children is the way they are labeled by themselves, their families, and society. By being classified and labeled, this provides children with a sense of self–empowerment and self-determination.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uAltS3HHD5cC|title=Facing Difference: Race, Gender, and Mass Media|last=Biagi|first=Shirley|last2=Kern-Foxworth|first2=Marilyn|date=1997-01-24|publisher=SAGE Publications|isbn=9780803990944|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disadvantages of a multiracial background===
There are some multiracial families that are against the idea of racial [[labeling]] because it downgrades them to a lower status. They classify the members in their families solely as “human” instead of labeling the multiple components of their heritage.Although, it is also common to explain the mixed heritage of this human.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Schwartz, Wendy "The Identity Development Of Multiracial Youth" Clearinghouse on Urban Education 1998&lt;/ref&gt; Also, some individuals consider themselves multiracial but have a hard time identifying themselves by every constituent of their heritage. Some may not feel close to some parts of their heritage or even all parts of their heritage. "Concern has been raised that this approach to multiracialism cannot provide individuals with a sustained sense of community because the group's only commonality is the "ambiguous status" of its members, and such a tenuous connection is not enough to provide the emotional support that multiracial people need."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; A multiracial person can also face complexities such as deciding whether to identify themselves with their father's or mother's racial group or both. This can be problematic when society does not support them with their decision. Furthermore, societal racism and discomfort with interracial marriage exists as well. There are people who have a strong [[prejudice]] for intermarriage and people marrying outside their race. They believe that those who cross ethnic lines are rejecting their [[Tradition|heritage]] and the distinction and certain values that their heritage has.

Sometimes multiracialism is used to create even deeper [[strata]] and hierarchies amongst oppressed people. For example, in many Western and colonized nations, mixed race people with European ancestry are deemed kinder, smarter or more attractive than single race individuals and those mixed with non European blood (such as black/indigenous mix). This grants privilege to lighter skinned individuals over darker skinned individuals and serves to distract both groups from identifying the larger issue which is white supremacy. See [[colorism]] for more on this topic.

===Advantages of a multiracial background===
The majority of mixed race and multi ethnic families seek to help their children to identify themselves with all parts of their ancestry.{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} Some believe that their different heritages should be maintained and celebrated equally. These families aim to provide their children with more cultural education about their heritage because this gives them a broader sense of their identity and world. If their upbringing encourages it, multi ethnic/racial people may be more accepting of different cultures and languages, though this can be the case for anyone regardless of racial or ethnic makeup.

The main benefit of this ideology is that people learn to embrace and coexist with those who are different and have different languages, colors, features, religions, expressions and ways of being.

On March 10, 1993, '''Michael Frederick Griffin''' murdered Dr. [[David Gunn (doctor)|David Gunn]] in [[Pensacola, Florida]], in the United States. This was the first documented murder of an [[Obstetrics and gynaecology|OB-GYN]] where the murderer's stated intention was to prevent a doctor from performing [[abortion]]s.&lt;ref name="Kushner"&gt;{{Cite book |last=Kushner |first=Harvey |title=Encyclopedia of Terrorism |year=2003 |publisher=[[SAGE Publications]] |location=[[University of Michigan]], [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]] |isbn=978-0-7619-2408-1 |page=154 |quote=In 1993... Griffin became the first activist to murder an abortion provider, ushering in a new level of terrorism in the abortion wars.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Griffin (at the time 31 years old) waited outside Gunn's clinic and shot him three times in the back. He is reported to have yelled, "Don't kill any more babies," just before the shooting.&lt;ref name=Waspo19930311&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/abortviolence/stories/gunn.htm|title=Doctor Killed During Abortion Protest|author=William Booth|publisher=[[Washington Post]]|date=March 11, 1993|accessdate=2007-04-09|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170720141851/http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/national/longterm/abortviolence/stories/gunn.htm#|archive-date=2017-07-20|dead-url=no|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Griffin did not attempt to hide his commission of the [[murder]], telling police, "We need an ambulance."

A jury deliberated three hours before finding him guilty on March 4, 1994. He was sentenced to life in prison, which he is serving at Okaloosa Correctional Institution in [[Crestview, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dc.state.fl.us/ActiveInmates/detail.asp?Bookmark=4&amp;From=list&amp;SessionID=740459946 Florida DoC Details] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110605063043/http://www.dc.state.fl.us/ActiveInmates/detail.asp?Bookmark=4&amp;From=list&amp;SessionID=740459946# |date=2011-06-05 }}, dc.state.fl.us; accessed November 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; The murder was one of the motivating factors in the creation of the federal [[Freedom of Access to Clinic Entrances Act]].&lt;ref&gt;"Griffin trial first test of access laws", ''Palm Beach Post'', October 3, 1994.&lt;/ref&gt; Gunn's death also prompted [[Paul Jennings Hill]] to issue the First Defensive Action Statement,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.armyofgod.com/defense.html First Defensive Action Statement] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090605153455/http://www.armyofgod.com/defense.html# |date=2009-06-05 }}, armyofgod.com; accessed November 6, 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; signed by 30 anti-abortion leaders, which justifies the killing of doctors who perform abortions.

==Association with John Burt==
During his trial, Griffin's lead defense attorney, Robert Kerrigan, argued that [[John Burt (anti-abortion activist)|John Burt]] "[[brainwashing|brainwashed]]" Griffin and drove him to commit murder.&lt;ref name="Rohter"/&gt; At the time, Burt was the Northwest Florida regional director of the national [[Pro-life movement|pro-life]] group Rescue America.&lt;ref name="Rohter"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=9807E2DC113AF936A35750C0A962958260&amp;sec=&amp;spon=&amp;pagewanted=1|title=Towering Over the Abortion Foe's Trial: His Leader|author=Larry Rohter|date=March 5, 1994|publisher=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Burt was a retired [[United States Marine Corps|U.S. Marine]] and former member of the [[Ku Klux Klan]] (though he claims to have "abandoned the group's racist doctrine when he became a born-again Christian&lt;ref name="Rohter"/&gt;") and a self-professed "spiritual adviser" to a group of activists who bombed three abortion clinics in 1984.&lt;ref name="Rohter"/&gt; He ran a "safe-house" for pregnant teenagers who had decided to take their pregnancies to term, called "Our Father's House".

In 2005, Burt was convicted of five counts of lewd or lascivious conduct for improperly touching and propositioning a 15-year-old girl at the house, and sentenced to 18 years in state prison.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/nation/20040512-1937-abortionprotester.html|title=Florida anti-abortion activist gets 18 years for molesting teen|author=Bill Kaczor|date=May 13, 2004|publisher=[[San Diego Union-Tribune]]|accessdate=2008-04-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cultural references==
In 1994, Gunn's murder inspired the first official single "[[Get Your Gunn]]" by alternative metal band [[Marilyn Manson (band)|Marilyn Manson]]. The lead singer, [[Marilyn Manson]], explained in a 1999 ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' [[op-ed]] piece on the [[Columbine High School Massacre]], that to him, Gunn's murder by "pro-life" activists was the ultimate hypocrisy he had witnessed as a young adult.&lt;ref name="RS Columbine: Whose Fault Is It?"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Marilyn Manson|title= Columbine: Whose Fault Is It?|format=op-ed essay|issue=815|date=1999-05-28|journal=[[Rolling Stone]]|publisher=Wenner Media LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denial of parole==

In November 2017, the Florida Commission on Offender Review denied Griffin's request for parole, ruling that he must remain in prison at least until the year 2043.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pnj.com/story/news/2017/10/31/parole-hearing-set-today-convicted-murderer-pensacola-abortion-doctor/819716001/|title=Michael Griffin, murderer of Pensacola abortion doctor David Gunn, is denied parole|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''National Talent Search Examination (NTSE)''' is a national-level scholarship program as well as one of the oldest and most prestigious examinations in [[India]] conducted by the National Council of Educational Research and Training [[National Council of Educational Research and Training|NCERT]] at the [[Secondary school]] level to identify and recognize students with high intellect and academic talent. Introduced in 1963 with the objective of acknowledging intelligent students and nurturing their talent, the National Talent Search Examination is touted as one of the toughest exams held across India at the high-school level. Merely going through the prescribed school books is not enough to prepare for the exam. The skill-based assessment is based on the syllabi of different central and state education boards, and primarily focuses on measuring how well the students have learned the concepts and skills underlying the school syllabus. The examination is conducted every year at two levels: Stage-I (State Level) and Stage-II (National Level). The total number of students appearing for class 10 exams of all state boards and central organisations put together is roughly 18.6 million (2018). &lt;br&gt;

An estimated 9,00,000-10,00,000 students of Class X appear for this scholarship exam every year for the 1st stage from which about 5000 are selected for the Stage 2 examination. About '''1000''' students are finally selected for the scholarship of which 250 are from the reserved category. It is held every year and aims at screening the most gifted students from the general lot -- the students who have a special aptitude for [[Science|Sciences]], [[Mathematics]], [[Social science|Social Sciences]] and, above all, questions based on [[analytical reasoning]]. The most important aspect of the exam is not the percentage a student scores but where he is placed in the descending order of merit list. This directly relates to one's cognitive skills and reasoning ability.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Study Package for NTSE Class X|url= |location= |publisher= McGraw Hill Education |page=vii |date= |isbn=978-93-85965-28-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This exam has undergone a lot of changes in recent years. Currently, from the year 2012-13, this exam is provided to Class X students only.

This exam is considered a headstart for important exams at undergraduate level like [[Joint Entrance Examination – Advanced|IIT-JEE]], [[NEET]] etc. Though the score is not needed for the evaluation in these exams, but the score is used by many coaching institutes which provides very high scholarships or free education for the future. 

An important decision was taken in the year 2008, when NTSE was opened only to the students of class VIII as against class X .In 2012, NTSE was reopened only for class X students, as against class VIII with the award of scholarships determined on the basis of the candidates’ scores in the [[Management Aptitude Test|MAT]] and SAT in the NTSE Second Level examination.

The scholarship at present is Rs 1250 for Higher/Senior  Secondary level,  Rs 2000 for Graduate and Post Graduate studies and as per UGC norms for Doctorate (Ph.D) level. The scholarship amount is distributed as a monthly stipend starting from Rs 1,250 for Class 11 and Class 12 students.

=== NTSE Stage 1 ===
The syllabus of the stage 1 examination is taken greatly from the state board books, especially Social Sciences. Concepts related to Science and Mathematics may come from state board books, as well as NCERT books, and may also include topics outside the syllabus.

=== NTSE Stage 2 ===
The syllabus of the stage 2 examination is mostly from the NCERT textbooks. However, topics of higher grades are frequently seen in the papers .The 2nd stage examination is much more difficult than the 1st stage as the questions of both SAT and MAT are difficult and the time is limited.

The '''Onafhankelijke Burger Partij''' ({{lang-en|Independent Citizens' Party}}, OBP) is a political party in the [[Netherlands]]. It was founded by [[Hero Brinkman]], a [[House of Representatives of the Netherlands|Member of the House of Representatives]] for the [[Party for Freedom]] (PVV). Brinkman left the PVV after repeatedly criticising the lack of democracy within that party, as well as its negative generalisations about certain groups in society. He then founded the OBP and intended it to participate in the [[Dutch general election, 2012|Dutch general election of 2012]]; however, on June 9, 2012 he announced that the OBP was to merge with the party [[Trots op Nederland]] to form a new party, the [[Democratic Political Turning Point]] ({{lang-nl|Democratisch Politiek Keerpunt}}, DPK).&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2012/03/hero_brinkman_quits_the_pvv_op.php Hero Brinkman quits the PVV, opposition call for new elections], DutchNews.nl, March 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{en icon}} [http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2012/06/new_dpkp_party_marks_a_turning_1.php New DPKP party marks a 'turning point', will fill gap on the right] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120622031930/http://www.dutchnews.nl/news/archives/2012/06/new_dpkp_party_marks_a_turning_1.php |date=2012-06-22 }}, DutchNews.nl, June 19, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; However, Trots op Nederland announced on November 17 that the merger of the OBP with the Trots would be reversed, because the Trots' management was unsatisfied with it.

[[Image:Caravane Marco Polo.jpg|thumb|A close up of the [[Catalan Atlas]] depicting [[Marco Polo]] travelling to the East during the ''Pax Mongolica'']]
The '''''Pax Mongolica''''' ([[Latin language|Latin]] for "[[Mongols|Mongol]] [[Peace]]"), less often known as '''''Pax Tatarica'''''&lt;ref&gt;[[Michael Prawdin]]. ''The Mongol Empire : its rise and legacy''. New Brunswick: Transaction, 2006. p.347&lt;/ref&gt; ("[[Tartary|Tatar]] Peace"), is a [[Historiography|historiographical term]] modelled after the original phrase ''[[Pax Romana]]'' which describes the stabilising effects of the conquests of the [[Mongol Empire]] on the social, cultural and economic life of the inhabitants of the vast [[Eurasia]]n territory that the Mongols conquered in the 13th and 14th centuries. The term is used to describe the eased communication and commerce the unified administration helped to create and the period of relative peace that followed the Mongols' vast [[Mongol invasions and conquests|conquests]].

The [[Mongol invasions and conquests|conquests]] of [[Genghis Khan]] (r. 1206–1227) and his [[List of Mongol rulers|successors]], spanning from [[Southeast Asia]] to [[Eastern Europe]], effectively connected the [[Eastern world]] with the [[Western world]]. The [[Silk Road]], connecting trade centres across [[Asia]] and [[Europe]], came under the sole rule of the Mongol Empire. It was commonly said that "a maiden bearing a nugget of gold on her head could wander safely throughout the realm".&lt;ref&gt;Charlton M. Lewis and W. Scott Morton. ''China: Its History and Culture (Fourth Edition).'' New York: McGraw-Hill, 2004. Print. p.121&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Laurence Bergreen]]. ''Marco Polo: From Venice to Xanadu.'' New York: Vintage, 2007. Print. p.27–28&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the [[Division of the Mongol Empire|political fragmentation of the Mongol Empire]] into four khanates ([[Yuan dynasty]], [[Golden Horde]], [[Chagatai Khanate]] and [[Ilkhanate]]), nearly a century of conquest and civil war was followed by relative stability in the early 14th century. The end of the ''Pax Mongolica'' was marked by the disintegration of the [[Khanate|khanates]] and the outbreak of the [[Black Death]] in Asia which [[Black Death migration|spread along trade routes]] to much of the world in the mid-14th century.

==Foundations==
{{See also|Mongol invasion of China|Organization of the Mongol Empire under Genghis Khan}}

[[Image:Mongol Empire map.gif|thumb|left|[[Mongol invasions and conquests|The expansion of the Mongol Empire]]]]

The foundations of the ''Pax Mongolica'' lie in the [[Mongol Empire]] beginning with [[Genghis Khan]] in the early 13th century. In the process of conquering the various tribes in the region, Genghis Khan revolutionised the way Mongolian tribal society was structured.&lt;ref&gt;[[David Morgan (historian)]]. ''The Mongols second edition''. Oxford: OUP, 2007. p.55&lt;/ref&gt; After each new victory, more and more people were incorporated under Genghis Khan's rule, thus diversifying the societal balance of the tribe. In 1203, Genghis Khan, in an effort to strengthen his army, ordered a reform that reorganised his army's structure while breaking down the traditional clan- and kindred-based divisions that had previously fragmented the society and military. He arranged his army into ''arbans'' (inter-ethnic groups of ten), and the members of an ''arban'' were commanded to be loyal to one another regardless of ethnic origin.&lt;ref&gt;[[Amy Chua]].

New York: Random House, 2007. p.95&lt;/ref&gt; Ten ''arbans'' made a ''zuun'', or a company; ten ''zuuns'' made a ''myangan'', or a battalion; and ten ''myangans'' formed a ''[[Tumen (unit)|tumen]]'', or an army of 10,000. This [[Mongol military tactics and organization#Decimal system|decimal system]] organisation of Genghis Khan's strong [[Mongol military tactics and organization|military]] would prove very effective in conquering, by persuasion or force, the many tribes of the central Asian steppe, but it would also strengthen Mongol society as a whole.&lt;ref name="JW28"&gt;[[Jack Weatherford]]. ''Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World''. New York: Three Rivers Press, 2004. p. 28&lt;/ref&gt; By 1206 Genghis Khan's military expansion had unified the tribes of Mongolia, and in the same year he was elected and acclaimed as the leader of [[Mongol Empire|Mongolia]].

The new Mongol Nation quickly moved to annex more territory. The first Mongol conquests were campaigns against the [[Western Xia]] in north-western China.&lt;ref name="All Empires"&gt;All Empires: Online History Community. [http://www.allempires.com/article/index.php?q=The_Mongol_Empire "The Mongol Empire."] Feb. 2007. Web. 22 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; In 1209 the Mongols conquered the Western Xia. Between 1213 and 1214 the Mongols conquered the [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jin Empire]], and by 1214 the Mongols had captured most of the land north of the [[Yellow River]].&lt;ref name="All Empires"/&gt; In 1221 Mongol generals [[Jebe]] and [[Subutai|Subodei]] began their expedition around the [[Caspian Sea]] and into [[Kievan Rus'|Kievan Rus]]'; Genghis Khan defeated Turkic [[Jalal ad-Din Mingburnu]] at the [[Battle of Indus]] and the war with the [[Khwārazm-Shāh dynasty|Khwarezmian Empire]] concluded the same year. In 1235 the Mongols invaded [[Mongol invasions of Korea|Korea]].&lt;ref name="All Empires"/&gt; Two years later in 1237 [[Batu Khan]] and [[Subodei]] began their conquest of [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Rus']]; they invaded [[First Mongol invasion of Poland|Poland]] and [[Mongol invasion of Europe#Invasion into Central Europe|Hungary]] in 1241. In 1252 the Mongols began their invasion of [[Mongol conquest of the Song Dynasty|Southern China]]; they would seize the capital of [[Hangzhou]] in 1276. In 1258 [[Hulagu Khan]] captured [[Battle of Baghdad (1258)|Baghdad]].&lt;ref name="All Empires"/&gt;

Each new victory gave the Mongols the chance to incorporate new peoples, especially foreign engineers and [[Laborer|labourers]], into their society. Each new conquest also acquired new trade routes and the opportunity to control [[Tax|taxation]] and [[tribute]]. Thus, through territorial expansion, the Mongol Nation not only became an empire, but it also became more [[Technology|technologically]] and [[Economics|economically]] advanced.&lt;ref name="JW28"/&gt;

==Trade network==

[[File:Yuan dynasty banknote with its printing plate 1287.jpg|thumb|left|Yuan dynasty banknote with its printing wood plate, 1287 CE.]]

At its height, the Mongolian empire stretched from [[Shanhaiguan District|Shanhaiguan]] in the east to [[Budapest]] in the west, from [[Mongol invasion of Rus'|Rus']] in the north to [[Tibet#13th, 14th and 15th centuries|Tibet]] in the south. This meant that an extremely large part of the continent was united under one political authority. As a result, the trade routes used by merchants became safe for travel, resulting in an overall [[Silk Road|growth and expansion of trade]] from China in the east to Britain in the west.&lt;ref&gt;Joseph Needham, Ling Wang. ''Science and civilisation in China.'' New York: Caimbridge UP, 1954.&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the ''Pax Mongolica'' greatly influenced many civilizations in [[Eurasia]] during the 13th and 14th centuries.

===World trade system===
[[File:Silk route.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Silk Road]] was a system of trade routes connecting East and West]]
[[File:Archaic globalization.svg|thumb|right|The 13th century world-system]]
Before the Mongols' rise, the [[Old World]] system consisted of isolated imperial systems.&lt;ref&gt;[[Janet Abu-Lughod]]. "The Shape of the World System in the Thirteenth Century." ''Studies in Comparative International Development'' 22.4 (1988): 3–25. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The new Mongol empire amalgamated the once isolated civilizations into a new continental system, and re-established the [[Silk Road]] as a dominant method of transportation. The unification of Eurasia under the Mongols greatly diminished the number of competing tribute gatherers throughout the trade network and assured greater safety and security in travel.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Abu-Lughod. ''Before European Hegemony: the world system a.d. 1250–1350.'' New York: OUP, 1989. Print. p.158&lt;/ref&gt;  During the ''Pax Mongolica'', European merchants like [[Marco Polo]] made their way from [[Europe]] to [[China]] on the well-maintained and well travelled roads that linked [[Anatolia]] to China.

On the Silk Road [[Caravan (travelers)|caravans]] with [[Silk#China|Chinese silk]]; [[Black pepper|pepper]], [[ginger]], [[cinnamon]], and [[nutmeg]] came to the [[Western world|West]] from the [[Maluku Islands|Spice Islands]] via the transcontinental trade routes. Eastern diets were introduced to Europeans as well.&lt;ref name="MP350"&gt;Michael Prawdin. ''The Mongol Empire: Its rise and legacy''. New Brunswick, NJ: Transaction, 2006. Print. p.350.&lt;/ref&gt; Indian muslins, cottons, pearls, and precious stones were sold in Europe, as well as weapons, carpets, and leather goods from [[Iran]].&lt;ref name="MP350"/&gt; Gunpowder was also introduced to Europe from China. In the opposite direction, Europeans sent silver, fine cloth, horses, linen, and other goods to the near and far East.&lt;ref name="MP350"/&gt; Increasing trade and commerce meant that the respective nations and societies increased their exposure to new goods and markets, thus increasing the [[Gross Domestic Product|GDP]] of each nation or society that was involved in the trade system. Μany of the cities participating in the 13th century world trade system grew rapidly in size.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Abu-Lughod. ''Before European Hegemony: the world system a.d. 1250–1350.'' New York: OUP, 1989. Print. p.356–357&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with land trade routes, a [[Indian Ocean trade|Maritime Silk Road]] contributed to the flow of goods and establishment of a ''Pax Mongolica''. This Maritime Silk Road started with short coastal routes in Southern China. As technology and navigation progressed these routes developed into a high-seas route into the Indian Ocean. Eventually these routes further developed encompassing the [[Arabian Sea]], [[Persian Gulf]], [[Red Sea]], and the sea off East Africa.&lt;ref&gt;Bira Shagdar. "The Mongol Empire in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries: East-West Relations". ''The Silk Roads: Highways of Culture and Commerce''. Vadime Elisseeff. Paris: Berghahn, 2000. 288–293. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Along with tangible goods, people, techniques, information, and ideas moved lucidly across the Eurasian landmass for the first time.&lt;ref name="FO108"&gt;Robert Findlay, Kevin H. O'Rourke. ''Power and Plenty: trade, war, and the world economy in the second millennium.'' Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2007. Print. p.108&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[John of Montecorvino]], archbishop of [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Beijing|Beijing]] founded [[Roman Catholic]] [[Mission (Christian)|missions]] in India and China and also translated the New Testament into the Mongolian language.&lt;ref name="FO108"/&gt; Long-distance trade brought new methods of doing business from the far East to Europe; [[Banknote|bills of exchange]], deposit banking, and insurance were introduced to Europe during the ''Pax Mongolica''.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Findlay, Kevin H. O'Rourke. ''Power and Plenty: trade, war, and the world economy in the second millennium''. Princeton, NJ: Princeton University Press, 2007. Print. p.109&lt;/ref&gt; Bills of exchange made it significantly easier to travel long distances because a traveller would not be burdened by the weight of metal coins.&lt;ref name="JW136"/&gt;

[[Islam]]ic methods of [[Mathematics in medieval Islam|mathematics]], [[Astronomy in medieval Islam|astronomy]], and [[Science in medieval Islam|science]] made their way to [[Africa]], [[East Asia]] and [[Europe]] during the ''Pax Mongolica''.&lt;ref&gt;John M. Hobson. ''The Eastern Origins of Western Civilization''. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge UP, 2004. Print. p.181.&lt;/ref&gt; Methods of paper-making and printing made their way from China to Europe. During the ''Pax Mongolica'' rudimentary banking systems were established, and money changing and credit extension were common, resulting in large amount of merchant wealth.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Bernstein]]. ''A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World.'' New York: Grove Press, 2008. Print. p.78–128&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mongol administration===
[[File:Mongol warrior of Genghis Khan.jpg|thumb|left|Mongol warrior on horseback, preparing a mounted archery shot.]]

Mongolia's central geographical position on the Asian continent was an important reason why it was able to play such a large role in the trade system.&lt;ref name="BS127-144"&gt;Bira Shagdar. "The Mongol Empire in the Thirteenth and Fourteenth Centuries: East-West Relations". ''The Silk Roads: Highways of Culture and Commerce''. Vadime Elisseeff. Paris: Berghahn, 2000. 127–144. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mongol military tactics and organization|Mongol army]] was easily able to assert strong rule throughout most of the [[Mongol Empire|empire]].&lt;ref name="JW136"&gt;Jack Weatherford. ''Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World''. New York: Three Rivers Press, 2004. Print. p.136&lt;/ref&gt; The military ensured that supply lines and trade routes flowed smoothly; permanent garrisons were established along trade routes to protect the travellers on these routes.&lt;ref name="JW136"/&gt; Complex local systems of taxation and extortion that were prevalent before Mongol rule were abolished to ensure the smooth flow of merchants and trade through the empire.&lt;ref name="JW136"/&gt; A system of weights-and-measures was also standardised.&lt;ref name="JW136"/&gt; To make the voyage on the trade routes less harrowing, the Mongols went as far as to plant trees along the roads to shade the merchants and travellers in the summer months; stone pillars were used to mark the roads where trees could not grow.&lt;ref name="JW136"/&gt;

The Mongols sought alliances with other nations and societies to ensure the flow of trade through the empire.&lt;ref name="JW136"/&gt; The Mongol army was also used to reshape and streamline the flow of trade through the continent by destroying cities on the less-important or more inaccessible routes.&lt;ref&gt;Jack Weatherford. ''Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World.'' New York: Three Rivers Press, 2004. Print. p.118–119&lt;/ref&gt; The Mongol military was mostly made up of cavalrymen. This allowed the military to move swiftly and easily over large distances.&lt;ref&gt;George Lane. ''Genghis Khan and Mongol Rule.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2004. Print. p.31&lt;/ref&gt;

The code of Mongol law, known as the ''[[Yassa]]'' ("Great Law"), decreed strict rules and punishments in many areas of the Mongolian Empire's society, especially those areas concerning trade and commerce. The ''Yassa'' helped suppress the traditional causes of tribal feuding and war, thus helping to ensure a peaceful trading and travelling environment;&lt;ref&gt;Jack Weatherford. ''Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World.'' New York: Three Rivers Press, 2004. Print. p.67&lt;/ref&gt; theft and animal rustling were outlawed, and the Mongol Empire under [[Genghis Khan]] even established a massive lost-and-found system.&lt;ref name="JW69"&gt;Jack Weatherford. ''Genghis Khan and the Making of the Modern World''. New York: Three Rivers Press, 2004. Print. p.69&lt;/ref&gt; Harsh penalties including a retribution of nine times the original value of stolen goods helped deter theft on Mongol roads.&lt;ref&gt;George Lane. "Daily Life in the Mongol Empire". Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2006. Print. p.216&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Yassa'' also decreed complete religious freedom, ensuring that Buddhists, Muslims, Christians, etc., were all allowed to travel freely throughout the empire; religious leaders were also exempted from taxation, as were doctors, lawyers, [[Funeral director|undertakers]], teachers, and scholars.&lt;ref name="JW69"/&gt; The ''Yassa'' did allow for flexibility and it usually adapted, absorbed, or built upon legal systems in remote parts of the empire, thus maintaining a level of openness to various societies and ensuring peace and stability.&lt;ref&gt;George Lane. ''Genghis Khan and Mongol Rule''. Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2004. Print. p.36&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Karen Armstrong. ''Islam: A Short History''. New York: Modern Library, 2002. Print. p.98&lt;/ref&gt;

In order to ensure Mongol law was enforced, a hierarchy of legal administration was developed. This was headed by the Secretarial Council "chug-shu-sheng" of the central government which oversaw 10 provincial governments known as "Hsing-sheng". The Hsinsing-sheng was further split into smaller districts which handled legal cases. A police commissioner known as "hsien wei" was entrusted with [[Yassa|law enforcement]] and had the authority to arrest suspects. This method of federalising the empire made it easier and more efficient for laws to be administered throughout the continent.&lt;ref&gt;George Lane. "Daily Life in the Mongol Empire". Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2006. Print. p.217–218&lt;/ref&gt;

===Postal system===
{{Main|Yam (route)}}The Mongols established the [[Yam (route)|Yam]] ({{lang-mn|Өртөө}}, ''Örtöö'', ''checkpoint''), the first system of communication that connected the Far East and the West. Relay stations were set up every 25–30 miles or an average day’s journey on horse. These stations were introduced by [[Ögedei Khan]] in 1234 and supplied fresh horses and [[fodder]]. His brothers [[Chagatai Khan]] and [[Tolui]] and his nephew [[Batu Khan]] further extended this network.&lt;ref name="BS127-144" /&gt;

The Mongol army administered the [[Yam (route)|Yam]]. The Yam stretched across Mongol territory from Eastern Europe to the Pacific Ocean.&lt;ref&gt;George Lane. ''Genghis Khan and Mongol Rule.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2004. Print. p.33&lt;/ref&gt; The routes were well organised, funded, maintained, and administrated by the Mongols.&lt;ref&gt;George Lane. ''Genghis Khan and Mongol Rule.'' Westport, CT: Greenwood Press, 2004. Print. p.35&lt;/ref&gt; This highly sophisticated system of communication and travel made it relatively easy to send important messages and travel long distances in relatively short amounts of time. As a result of the relatively lucid communication and ease of movement, the Mongols were able to govern their vast empire effectively, thus ensuring political and economic stability.&lt;ref name="BS127-144"/&gt;

==Decline==
The decline of the period of the ''Pax Mongolica'' was a result of a number of factors, these being incompetent and rivalling leaders, corruption, revolts, [[decadence]], factional struggles, assassinations, external attacks, and disease. The decline of the ''Pax Mongolica'' resulted in a decline of eased trade between East and West.&lt;ref name="BS127-144"/&gt;

===Decline of Mongol rule===
[[Image:Mongolia 1500 AD.jpg|thumb|Mongol residual states and domains by the 15th century]]
The Mongol Empire, near the time of its decline, consisted of many different territories that varied from one to another. Each territory was defined as a "[[khanate]]". Due to the isolation of the Mongolian world, many rulers in the 14th century started to focus on their own khanates.

[[Religious intolerance]] was one particular factor in the decline of the ''Pax Mongolica''. In [[Vladimir-Suzdal|Rus]]', the Mongols (known as the [[Golden Horde]]), gradually lost power and territory due to intolerance specifically geared towards different religions. The Rus' Mongols converted to [[Islam]] and joined the [[Mamluk Sultanate (Cairo)|Egyptian Mamluks]] for political reasons. At one point in the war the Golden Horde even fought the [[Ilkhanate|Persian Mongols]].&lt;ref name="BS127-144"/&gt; The eastern part of the Golden Horde, [[White Horde]], had friendly relations with the Ilkhanate and the Great Khan. The [[decentralization|decentralisation]] occurred because communication was so difficult due to the collapsing trade system and the rivalry between Mongol princes. Eventually, the [[Persian people|Persian]] Mongol leader [[Ghazan]] converted to Islam in 1295. This contributed to the growing power of [[Nawrūz (Mongol emir)|Nawruz]]; a Muslim [[Oirats|Oirat]] general.

In China, descendants of [[Kublai Khan]] claimed the Mongols weakened their power by becoming "too Chinese". This led to [[Yuan dynasty|Yuan]] emperors separating themselves from their subjects in order to stress their Mongol identity and to reject their Chinese culture. Kublai Khan once promoted Chinese culture and the importance of its practice but under the Yuan emperors this was prohibited. As the Chinese culture was changing, intolerance became more common. Some Chinese thought that they were planning to kill Chinese children and perform sexual rituals on them. This led many Chinese to become [[xenophobia|xenophobic]] towards the Mongols. This xenophobia led Chinese rulers to expel the Mongols from China and to isolate China from the rest of the world trade system.&lt;ref name="BS127-144"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles King. ''The Black Sea: A History.'' New York: OUP, 2004. Print. p.90&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Black Death===
{{Main|Black Death}}
[[Image:Bubonic plague map 2.png|thumb|right|The spread of the [[Black Death]] in Europe; it was introduced to Europe from Asia]]
The segregation and fragmentation of the respective khanates in the Mongol Empire were not the only factors in contributing to the decline of the ''Pax Mongolica''. The outbreak of [[bubonic plague]], or [[Black Death]], also played a devastating role in the decline of the ''Pax Mongolica''. Because the Mongol Empire bridged once isolated regions, it made it easy for the Black Death to spread rapidly.&lt;ref&gt;Angus Mackay, ed. ''Atlas of Medieval Europe''. New York: Routledge, 1997. Print. p.209&lt;/ref&gt;  Historian [[William Hardy McNeill|William H. McNeill]] has noted that the plague was transferred from ground rodents living in southern Chinese and Burmese Himalayan foothills to Mongol soldiers when they [[Mongol conquest of Tibet|invaded]] the area in 1252.&lt;ref name="WB139"&gt;William J. Bernstein. ''A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World.'' New York: Grove Press, 2008. Print. p.139&lt;/ref&gt; In 1331 the [[Bubonic plague|plague]] was noted in China,&lt;ref name="WB139"/&gt; and from east Asia it was carried west along the [[Silk Road|trade routes]] by merchants and Mongol soldiers who were able to so freely and quickly travel across the continent during the ''Pax Mongolica''. Plague-infected fleas hitched rides in the manes of [[Horse|horses]], on the hair of [[Camel|camels]], or on [[Black rat|black rats]] that nestled in cargoes or in [[Saddlebag|saddlebags]].&lt;ref&gt;William J. Bernstein. ''A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World''. New York: Grove Press, 2008. Print. p.139–140&lt;/ref&gt; The Black Death is estimated to have killed one-third of China's population and 25 to 50 percent of Europe's population.&lt;ref&gt;William J. Bernstein. ''A Splendid Exchange: How Trade Shaped the World''. New York: Grove Press, 2008. Print. p.145&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographically weakened, the Mongols were not able to exert their rule over remote domains in their empire, who began to revolt once the plague broke out.&lt;ref&gt;Janet Abu-Lughod. ''Before European Hegemony: The World System A.D. 1250–1350''. New York: OUP, 1989. Print. p.183&lt;/ref&gt; These revolts disrupted the production of goods and flow of trade, which ended the ''Pax Mongolica''.&lt;ref&gt;Laurence Bergreen. ''Marco Polo: From Venice to Xanadu.'' New York: Vintage, 2007. Print. p.358&lt;/ref&gt;

===Effects on trade===
Over the next 300 years China would become extremely isolated from foreign merchants; China prohibited foreigners or foreign trade and languages other than Chinese. [[Confucianism]] and [[Taoism]] were reinstated as the national religion and the Chinese experienced cultural stagnation.&lt;ref name="JW340-348"&gt;Janet Abu-Lughod. ''Before European Hegemony: The World System A.D. 1250–1350''. New York: OUP, 1989. Print. p.340–348&lt;/ref&gt; During the early years of the [[Ming dynasty|Ming-dynasty]] trade with the rest of the world declined.&lt;ref name="JW340-348"/&gt; This is attributed to war, epidemics and widespread disruptions rather than "symbolic policy change".&lt;ref name="JW340-348"/&gt; Economic difficulties also contributed to the decline as an important world trade player.&lt;ref name="JW340-348"/&gt; The [[Black Death]] quickly spread to the rest of the world trade system, and the long-distance trading that was common and applauded during the ''Pax Mongolica'' almost entirely stopped.

== Personnel exchanges ==

Under the Mongols new technologies and commodities were exchanged across the [[Old World]], particularly [[Eurasia]]. Professor Thomas T.Allsen noted many personnel exchanges occurred during the Mongol period.&lt;ref&gt;Thomas T. Allsen - ''Culture and Conquest in Mongol Eurasia'', p.6&lt;/ref&gt; There were many significant developments in economy (especially trade and public finance), [[military]], [[medicine]], [[agriculture]], [[cuisine]], [[astronomy]], [[printing]], [[geography]], and [[historiography]], which were not limited to Eurasia but also included [[North Africa]].

The '''Pentrich rising''' was an armed uprising in 1817 that began around the village of [[Pentrich, Derbyshire]], in the [[United Kingdom]]. It occurred on the night of 9/10 June 1817. While much of the planning took place in Pentrich, two of the three ringleaders were from South Wingfield and the other was from Sutton in Ashfield; the 'revolution' itself started from Hunt's Barn in South Wingfield, and the only person killed died in Wingfield Park. 

A gathering of some two or three hundred men (stockingers, quarrymen and iron workers), led by [[Jeremiah Brandreth]] ('The Nottingham Captain'), (an unemployed stockinger, and claimed by [[Gyles Brandreth]] as an ancestor{{cn|date=July 2018}} — although unlikely, since Brandreth's children emigrated to America), set out from [[South Wingfield]] to march to [[Nottingham]]. They were lightly armed with pikes, scythes and a few guns, which had been hidden in a quarry in Wingfield Park, and had a set of rather unfocused revolutionary demands, including the wiping out of the  [[National Debt]].&lt;ref name=cooper&gt;Cooper, B (1983) ''Transformation of a Valley: The Derbyshire Derwent'' Heinemann, republished 1991 Cromford: Scarthin Books&lt;/ref&gt;

However, one among them, [[William J. Oliver]], was a government spy, and the uprising was quashed soon after it began. Three men were hanged and beheaded at [[Derby Gaol]] for their participation in the uprising: Jeremiah Brandreth, Isaac Ludlam and William Turner.&lt;ref name="Cannon2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=John Cannon|title=A Dictionary of British History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nU32UZQ8o3wC&amp;pg=PT1106|accessdate=17 May 2012|date=4 July 2009|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-955038-8|page=1106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical background==
Following the end of the [[Napoleonic Wars]] in 1815, a number of factors combined to drive the country into a severe [[Recession|depression]]. The increased [[industrialisation]] of the country, combined with the demobilisation of the forces, led to mass unemployment. The [[Corn Laws]] led to massive increases in the price of bread, while the repeal of [[Taxation in the United Kingdom|income tax]] meant that the war debt had to be recovered by taxing commodities forcing their prices even higher. In addition, 1816 was unusually wet and cold, producing a very poor harvest.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt;

The loss of production of war materials had affected engineering companies like the [[Butterley Company]], the price of [[iron ore]] had slumped, and the production of [[coal]] had fallen by a third. The hosiery trade had also been falling away for about five years.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt;

There was, in addition, a wider political picture. Since the previous century, there had been calls for parliamentary reform, particularly an end to the [[rotten borough]]s. Subsequently there had been the [[French Revolution]] and the [[Reign of Terror]] and it appeared that any reform would be accompanied by violence, which [[William Pitt the Younger|Pitt]]'s government set out to pre-empt by increasingly punitive measures.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt;

==Prelude==
Since 1811, there had been minor local uprisings, with [[stocking frame]]s being smashed in protest at the employment of unskilled workers to produce low-quality stockings. Further afield, there had been food riots in many of the big cities.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt;

Around the country there were a number of secret revolutionary committees. The one at Nottingham was headed by a needle maker, William Stevens, and its representative from Pentrich was a framework knitter called Thomas Bacon. Bacon was known to have revolutionary views, and was the originator of the [[Hampden Clubs|Pentrich Hampden Club]]. &lt;ref name=turbutt&gt;Turbutt, G., (1999) ''A History of Derbyshire,'' Cardiff: Merton Priory Press, (Vol3 pp1265-1271) &lt;/ref&gt; Several meetings were held at Pentrich during which Bacon asserted that preparations for an uprising were well advanced, and he had made enquiries at the ironworks and elsewhere about procuring weaponry.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt;

The decision to take action was made when news arrived of a revolutionary force heading from the north—a hoax fabricated by [[William J Oliver|William Oliver]], a paid informer under the [[Home Office]]'s instruction. The aim was to join them to march on London in support of a bill by Sir [[Francis Burdett]] for parliamentary reform.&lt;ref&gt;Turbutt, G., (1999) ''A History of Derbyshire,'' Cardiff: Merton Priory Press, (Vol4 p 1491) &lt;/ref&gt; 

Bacon was suspected of machinery breaking and, with a warrant out for his arrest, had gone into hiding. He therefore appointed [[Jeremiah Brandreth]], an unemployed stocking knitter with a wife and two children, to be his deputy. Opinion of Brandreth at the time seems to have been somewhat mixed, but he promised the men that they would go to Nottingham, invading [[Butterley Company|Butterley ironworks]] on the way, where they would kill the three senior managers and ransack it for weapons. At Nottingham they would receive bread, beef and ale, and a sum of money, and they would take over the [[barracks]]. They would then proceed by boat down the [[River Trent]] and attack [[Newark-on-Trent|Newark]]. He told them that there were sixteen thousand ready to join them.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt;

Among those present were Isaac Ludlam, a bankrupted farmer who owned a small quarry where he had built up a small cache of [[Pike (weapon)|pike]]s, and William Turner an ex-soldier. The plan was to assemble at ten o'clock on 8 June, where Ludlam's pikes would be distributed and further weapons would be acquired by requisitioning a man and a gun from each house that they passed.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt;

==The march==
At 10 pm on 9 June, around fifty men assembled at Hunt's Barn in [[South Wingfield]] and for four hours ranged around the neighbourhood for weapons and extra men. At one house a widow, Mary Hepworth, lived with her two sons. When she refused to open up, the rioters broke a window and Brandreth fired a shot through it, killing a servant. Some of the party were appalled at this wanton act, but Brandreth threatened to shoot them also if they did not remain.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt;

Eventually the group set out for the Butterley Company works. When they arrived they were confronted by George Goodwin, the factory agent, who, with a few constables, faced them down. One or two of the party defected and, increasingly demoralised, the remainder headed for [[Ripley, Derbyshire|Ripley]].&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt;

There was no police force at that time. Order was maintained by the various semi-private armies such as the [[yeomanry]], while intelligence was gathered by the [[Home Secretary]], [[Henry Addington, 1st Viscount Sidmouth|Lord Sidmouth]], from a network formed of local [[magistrate]]s and paid informers.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt;

Through Ripley they pressed more followers into service and at [[Codnor]] and [[Langley Mill]] they awoke various publicans for beer, bread and cheese. It was now raining heavily and yet more men defected.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt;

At [[Giltbrook]] they were met by a small force of soldiers: twenty men of the [[15th The King's Hussars|15th Regiment of Light Dragoons]]. The revolutionaries scattered and, while about forty were captured, the leaders managed to escape, to be arrested over the following months.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt;

==Retribution==
Altogether, eighty-five of the marchers were placed in Nottingham and Derby gaols, to be brought to trial at the County Hall in Derby, charged in the main of "maliciously and traitorously [endeavouring]...by force of arms, to subvert and destroy the Government and the Constitution". 

Twenty-three were sentenced, three to transportation for fourteen years and eleven for life. As for the ringleaders, the government was determined to make an example of them, hoping that "they could silence the demand for reform by executions for high treason". 

Brandreth was apprehended at [[Bulwell]] on 22 July, while Isaac Ludlam was captured in [[Uttoxeter]]. Thomas Bacon and his brother John were caught in [[St Ives, Cambridgeshire|St.Ives]],then in [[Huntingdonshire]] as a result of a £100 reward. The trial was organised by William Lockett, the deputy Clerk of the Peace, who assembled "a group of 'respectable' jurors from the farming community on whom he could depend".&lt;ref name=turbutt/&gt;

Initially, Bacon, Brandreth and George Weightman (Bacon's brother-in-law) were to stand trial. However, Bacon knew of the part that William Oliver had played, which, had he revealed it, would have embarrassed the government and might have prejudiced the jury in favour of the defendants. Brandreth was therefore tried as the leader, with Turner, Ludlam and Weightman as accomplices. All four were convicted of high treason and sentenced to death. However, Weightman was reprieved due to a recommendation for leniency by the jury, and, with Bacon, was sentenced to transportation for life.&lt;ref name=turbutt/&gt; Weightman was transported to the colonies, in his case, Australia and died in 1865, aged 68, in [[Kiama, New South Wales]]. &lt;ref&gt;http://monumentaustralia.org.au/themes/government/dissent/display/96159-george-weightman&lt;/ref&gt; He never returned to England to his wife and children. He was noted as a worthy and upstanding citizen.

Although the customary quartering was remitted by the [[English Regency|Prince Regent]], the three were publicly hanged and beheaded at Nuns Green in front of Friar Gate Gaol in Derby.&lt;ref name=cooper/&gt;

The episode brought no credit to the government and many liberal thinkers of the time were disgusted by the verdicts and the executions. Lord Sidmouth was especially much criticised for his use of Oliver as [[agent provocateur]]. Nevertheless, Lockett was able to say that the verdicts of the trial "were to have a salutary effect on the behaviour of the 'lower orders' in Pentrich and elsewhere".&lt;ref name=turbutt/&gt;

There is little to be seen nowadays of the event,though the martyrs, together with Weightman are commemorated in Giltbrook street names. The hexagonal office, where Goodwin stood his ground, existed in the yard of the Butterley Company's works until it was demolished in 2009/10 along with the rest of the site, and the execution block can be seen by request in Derby Museum.

[[E. P. Thompson]] in ''[[The Making of the English Working Class]]'' sees this rising as a transitional event between the earlier [[Luddite]] actions and the later populist [[Radicalism (historical)|Radicalism]] of 1818–20 and [[Reform Act 1832#Passage of the Reform Act|1830–32]]. (Note that Thompson refers to the village throughout as 'Pentridge', not the modern spelling.)

'''Francis Rory Peregrine''' "'''Perry'''" '''Anderson''' (born 11 September 1938)&lt;ref name="The Peerage"&gt;http://www.thepeerage.com/p26186.htm#c261853.1&lt;/ref&gt; is a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[intellectual]] and [[essayist]]. His work ranges across historical sociology, intellectual history, and cultural analysis. What unites them is Anderson's preoccupation with [[Western Marxism]]. Anderson is perhaps best known as the moving force behind the ''[[New Left Review]]''. He is Professor of History and Sociology at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] (UCLA). Anderson has written many books, most recently ''The Antinomies of Gramsci'' and ''The H-Word: The Peripeteia of Hegemony'', both published in 2017. He is the brother of political scientist [[Benedict Anderson]] (1936–2015).

==Background and early life==
Anderson was born in 1938 in [[London]]. His father, James Carew O'Gorman Anderson (1893–1946), known as Shaemas, an official with the [[Chinese Maritime Customs]], was born into an [[Anglo-Irish]] family, the younger son of Brigadier-General Sir Francis Anderson, of [[Ballydavid]], [[County Waterford]].&lt;ref&gt;Sir Bernard Burke, Peter Townsend, ''Burke's Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry'' (1969), p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; He was descended from the [[Clan Anderson|Anderson family]] of Ardbrake, [[Drummuir|Bothriphnie]], [[Scotland]], who had settled in [[Ireland]] in the early 18th century.&lt;ref name=shaemas&gt;Perry Anderson, [http://www.lrb.co.uk/v20/n15/perry-anderson/a-belated-encounter A Belated Encounter] (Anderson's short biography of his father James)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Journal of the Old Waterford Society 1994|url=http://snap.waterfordcoco.ie/collections/ejournals/101014/101014.pdf}} P. 7, para. 9.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/genealogicalhera00burkuoft#page/8/mode/1up Genealogical and Heraldic History of the Landed Gentry of Ireland.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Anderson's mother, Veronica Beatrice Mary Bigham, was [[English people|English]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://researchrepository.napier.ac.uk/2231/1/WollmannBenedictAnderson-Wollman-Spencer.pdf "The Influence of Benedict Anderson".]&lt;/&lt;/ref&gt; the daughter of [[Trevor Bigham]], who was the [[Deputy Commissioner of Police of the Metropolis|Deputy Commissioner]] of the [[Metropolitan Police]], 1914–1931. Anderson's grandmother, Frances, Lady Anderson, belonged to the [[Gaelic Ireland|Gaelic]] [[Gorman (surname)|Gorman]] [[Irish clans|clan]] of [[County Clare]] and was the daughter of the [[Irish Home Rule Movement|Irish Home Rule]] Member of Parliament Major [[Purcell O'Gorman]],&lt;ref name="clarelibrary.ie"&gt;James Frost, [http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/history/frost/chap9_macgormans.htm "The History and Topography of the County of Clare - Pedigree of MacGorman (O’Gorman)"], Clare County Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.clarelibrary.ie/eolas/coclare/history/frost/chap9_ui_bracain.htm "The History and Topography of the County of Clare – Ui Bracain..."], Clare County Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=John O'Hart, Irish Pedigree's, or, The Origin and Stem of the Irish Nation|url=https://archive.org/details/irishpedigreesor_01ohar }}&lt;/ref&gt; himself the son of Nicholas Purcell O'Gorman who had been involved with the [[Irish republicanism|Republican]] [[Society of United Irishmen]] during the [[Irish Rebellion of 1798|1798 Rebellion]], later becoming Secretary of the [[Catholic Association]] in the 1820s.&lt;ref name="clarelibrary.ie"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/s3unitedirishmen00madduoft#page/270/mode/1up "The United Irishmen, their lives and times"/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kieran Sheedy, [http://www.irelandmidwest.com/clare/history/historyessays.htm "The United Irishmen of County Clare"], County Clare – Historical Essays.&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson's father had previously been married to the novelist [[Stella Benson]], and it was after her death in 1933 that he married again.&lt;ref name=shaemas/&gt;

Anderson was educated at [[Eton College|Eton]] and [[Worcester College, Oxford|Worcester College]], [[University of Oxford|Oxford]], where he took his first degree.&lt;ref name="Elliott p. 1"&gt;Gregory Elliott (1998), [https://books.google.com/books?id=TmeeV9POhgsC&amp;dq= Perry Anderson: The Merciless Laboratory of History, University of Minnesota Press], p. 1.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1962 Anderson became [[editor]] of the ''[[New Left Review]]'', a position he held for twenty years.&lt;ref name=Blackwell/&gt; As scholars of the [[New Left]] began to reassess their [[canon (basic principle)|canon]] in the mid-1970s, Anderson provided an influential perspective.&lt;ref name=Blackwell&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Blackwell Dictionary of Historians |last=Parker |first=David |editor=[[John Cannon (historian)|Cannon, John]] |year=1988 |publisher=Basil Blackwell Ltd. |location=Oxford; New York |isbn=063114708X |pages=8–9 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He published two major volumes of analytical history in 1974: ''Passages from [[Ancient history|Antiquity]] to [[Feudalism]]'' focuses on the creation and endurance of [[Feudalism|feudal social formations]], while ''Lineages of the Absolutist State'' examines [[Absolute monarchy|monarchical absolutism]]. Within their respective topics they are each vast in scope, assessing the whole history of Europe from classical times to the nineteenth century. The books achieved an instant prominence for Anderson, whose wide-ranging analysis [[wikt:synthesis|synthesis]]ed elements of history, [[philosophy]], and [[political theory]].&lt;ref name=Blackwell/&gt;

In the 1980s Anderson took office as a professor at the [[New School for Social Research]] in New York.&lt;ref name=Blackwell/&gt; He returned as editor at ''NLR'' in 2000 for three more years, and after his retirement continued to serve on the journal's editorial committee. As of 2018, Anderson continued to make contributions to the ''[[London Review of Books]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lrb.co.uk/contributors/perry-anderson |title=Perry Anderson in the LRB Archive |author=London Review of Books |year=2012 |publisher=LRB Ltd. |work=Lrb.co.uk |accessdate=29 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and continued to teach as a Distinguished Professor of History and Sociology at the [[University of California, Los Angeles]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.history.ucla.edu/people/faculty?lid=252 |title=Perry R. Anderson, UCLA Faculty |author=UCLA Department of History |year=2012 |publisher=UCLA |work=History.ucla.edu |accessdate=29 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120412005907/http://www.history.ucla.edu/people/faculty?lid=252 |archivedate=12 April 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Influence and criticism==
Anderson bore the brunt of the disapproval of [[E. P. Thompson]] in the latter's ''The Poverty of Theory'', in a controversy during the late 1970s over the [[structural Marxism]] of [[Louis Althusser]], and the use of history and theory in the politics of the Left. In the mid-1960s, Thompson wrote an essay for the annual ''Socialist Register'' that rejected Anderson's view of [[aristocratic]] dominance of Britain's historical trajectory, as well as Anderson's seeming preference for continental European theorists over radical British traditions and [[empiricism]]. Anderson delivered two responses to Thompson's [[polemics]], first in an essay in ''New Left Review'' (January–February 1966) called "Socialism and Pseudo-Empiricism"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Anderson | first = Perry | title = Socialism and pseudo-empiricism | journal = [[New Left Review]] | volume = I | issue = 35 | pages = 2–42 | publisher = New Left Review | date = January–February 1966 | url = http://newleftreview.org/I/35/perry-anderson-socialism-and-pseudo-empiricism | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then in a more conciliatory yet ambitious overview, ''Arguments within English Marxism'' (1980).

While Anderson faced many attacks in his native Britain for favouring continental European philosophers over British thinkers, he did not spare [[Western Marxism|Western European Marxists]] from criticism; see his ''Considerations on Western Marxism'' (1976). Nevertheless, many of his assaults were delivered against [[postmodernist]] currents in continental Europe. In his book ''In the Tracks of Historical [[Materialism]]'' Anderson depicts Paris as the new capital of intellectual reaction, placing himself  at odds with those who treat postmodernism as a left-wing heresy.

'''''ReGeneration''''' is a 2010 American [[documentary film]] written and directed by Phillip Montgomery that looks at the issues facing today's youth and young adults, and the influences that contribute to America's current culture of apathy toward to political and social causes.&lt;ref name="Variety"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.variety.com/article/VR1118018758?refCatId=13 |title=Ryan Gosling to narrate 'ReGeneration' |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |date=May 5, 2010 |accessdate=October 12, 2011 |author=Siegel, Tatiana}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{United States Senate}}

The '''Seal of the United States Senate''' is the [[Seal (emblem)|seal]] officially adopted by the [[United States Senate]] to [[Authentication|authenticate]] certain official [[document]]s. Its design also sometimes serves as a sign and symbol of the Senate, appearing on its official [[flag]] among other places. The current version dates from 1886, and is the third seal design used by the Senate since its inception in 1789. The use of the seal is restricted by [[United States federal law|federal law]] and other regulations, and so is used sparingly, to the point that there are alternate, non-official seal designs more commonly seen in public.

The seal has a shield with 13 [[Five-pointed star|stars]] on top and 13 vertical stripes on the bottom, with a scroll inscribed with ''[[E pluribus unum]]'' floating across the top. An [[olive branch]], symbolizing peace, graces the left side of the shield, while an [[oak]] branch, symbolizing strength, is on the right. A red [[Phrygian cap|liberty cap]] above the shield and crossed [[fasces]] below the shield represent freedom and authority, respectively. Blue beams of light emanate from the shield. Surrounding the seal is the legend "United States Senate". Several of the elements are derived from the [[Great Seal of the United States]].&lt;ref name="senatebrief"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Senate_Seal.htm|title=Senate Seal|publisher=[[United States Senate]]|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Usage==
The seal is affixed to [[Impeachment in the United States|impeachment]] documents and resolutions of consent to [[international treaties]]. It also appears on presentation copies of Senate resolutions recognizing appointments, commendations, and notable achievements.&lt;ref name="senatebrief"/&gt; Other uses include authentication of senator credentials, and also [[Electoral College (United States)|electoral votes]] for President and Vice President.&lt;ref name="saltonstall"&gt;{{cite book|title=History of the Senate Seals|publisher=[[United States Government Publishing Office|Government Printing Office]]|last=Saltonstall|first=Leverett|authorlink=Leverett Saltonstall|author2=Frazier, Emery L. |year=1966|series=Senate document 164 of the 82d Congress, 2nd session}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The seal is kept in the custody of the [[Secretary of the United States Senate|Secretary of the Senate]],&lt;ref name="ethicsmanual"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ethics.senate.gov/downloads/pdffiles/manual.pdf|format=PDF|title=Senate Ethics Manual|publisher=Select Committee on Ethics, United States Senate|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; who also can authorize other specific uses.&lt;ref name="usc"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.law.cornell.edu/uscode/text/18/713-|title=18 U.S.C. § 713 (c)|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the twentieth century, the Secretary has authorized its official use by the [[Party leaders of the United States Senate|majority and minority leaders]].&lt;ref name="senatebrief"/&gt;

It is illegal to use the Senate seal in any manner reasonably calculated to convey a false impression of sponsorship or approval by the Government of the United States.&lt;ref name="usc"/&gt;

===Depictions===
[[Image:Trent Lott official photo 2007.jpg|thumb|left|120px|[[Trent Lott]] posing next to the Senate seal]]
The seal is depicted in a stained glass window in the [[United States Capitol]].  There are four grand staircases in the building, and all four stairwells contain a large stained glass window, each with a different design.  One of these windows, on the Senate side of the Capitol, originally depicted an eagle with a shield and flags of the United States but it was accidentally destroyed in the 1960s.  The window was initially filled in with frosted glass, but was later replaced with a colorful design depicting the senate seal.  The window is also visible from the office on the other side (room S-210, currently the [[United States Senate Majority Whip|majority whip]]'s office).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mcconnell.senate.gov/whip_facts.cfm|title=Majority Whip Office Historical Facts|accessdate=2008-02-11|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070805185735/http://mcconnell.senate.gov/whip_facts.cfm|archivedate=2007-08-05|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;   An image of this window served as the theme of the Senate's web page from about 2002 to 2006.&lt;ref&gt;This can be seen with snapshots taken at web.archive.org; it first appeared on [https://web.archive.org/web/20021031080017/https://www.senate.gov/ October 31, 2002] and was used until late January, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Senate never had an official flag until the 1980s, even though by then most other government agencies, departments, and offices had one.  In April 1984, Senator [[Daniel Inouye]] of Hawaii proposed that the Senate commission an official flag using the design of the Senate seal.  After turning down several submitted designs, the committee turned to the [[United States Army Institute of Heraldry|Army Institute of Heraldry]], which proposed a navy blue flag with the seal in the center.  This was approved in 1987, and the flags were made available in March 1988.  Each senator and committee were limited to two flags apiece, and in keeping with the usual limits on the seal, use of the flags is restricted to Senate offices only, and commercial use is prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/common/briefing/Senate_Flag.htm|title=Senate Flag|publisher=United States Senate|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A Senate flag is also hung above the dais of the [[Hart Senate Office Building|Hart Building]]’s central hearing room.&lt;ref name="senatebrief"/&gt;

The Senate seal, along with the [[:Image:US-DeptOfJustice-Seal.svg|seal of the Department of Justice]], was used on the reverse of the 1998 commemorative dollar coin honoring [[Robert F. Kennedy]].  The seals symbolized Kennedy's career in the U.S. government, first as [[United States Attorney General]] and later as a senator from [[New York (state)|New York]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.usmint.gov/mint_programs/commemoratives/index.cfm?action=RFKennedy|title=Robert F. Kennedy Commemorative Silver Dollar Fact Sheet|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At least during the 1960s, a painted version of the seal was also on the ceiling of the office of the Secretary of the Senate.&lt;ref name="saltonstall"/&gt;

==History==
===1790s seal===

[[Image:US-Senate-1790sSeal-Scan.png|thumb|180px|Seal used from 1798 to 1804]]
When first meeting in [[Philadelphia]] in the 1790s, members of the early Senate admired the visually appealing Great Seal enough that they had it reproduced on a carpet woven for their chamber.  They also selected a similar design for the first official Senate seal.&lt;ref name="senateminute"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/Senate_Seal.htm|title=Historical Minutes: 1878–1920: Senate Seal|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Trenchard 1786 Great Seal Obverse.jpg|thumb|100px|left|Trenchard's 1786 Great Seal]]
This first design had an eagle with a shield on its breast, olive branches in its left talon, and arrows in its right. Above the eagle were rays of light emanating from clouds, representing the emergence of the new nation. Encircling the design was the legend &lt;small&gt;SENATE OF THE UNITED STATES&lt;/small&gt;.&lt;ref name="senatebrief"/&gt;  While the design was clearly based on the Great Seal of the United States, the engraving was distinctly different.  It had a spade [[Escutcheon (heraldry)|shield]] instead of the more familiar shape on the Great Seal, and the eagle had no scroll in its beak.  The design of the clouds and light rays was also different, and the inscription showed it was a seal made specifically for the Senate (the Great Seal has no inscription at all).&lt;ref name="saltonstall"/&gt;  The design is actually closer to a rendition made by James Trenchard for the September 1786 ''Columbian Magazine'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatseal.com/committees/realizations.html|title= First Realizations of the Great Seal|publisher=greatseal.com|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was also later used on the reverse side of a few Indian Peace Medals given by President Washington in about the same time frame as the Senate seal was made.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatseal.com/peace/indianmedals.html|title=Indian Peace Medals|publisher=greatseal.com|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Exactly when this first seal was made, or by whom, is not known.&lt;ref name="saltonstall"/&gt;

The first known use of this seal was on the March 1798 impeachment summons of Tennessee Senator [[William Blount]]. Six years later, the seal appeared on another impeachment summons, this time for Federal Judge [[John Pickering (judge)|John Pickering]], and other documents during his trial.&lt;ref name="senatebrief"/&gt;&lt;ref name="saltonstall"/&gt;

===1831 Seal===

[[Image:US-Senate-1831Seal-Scan.png|thumb|180px|Seal used from 1831 to 1880]]
By 1830, the first Senate seal was either unserviceable due to wear or simply lost after a period of not being used.  A new seal was commissioned from Robert G. Lanphier, Jr., a French artist, engraver and jeweler living in [[Washington D.C.]] at the time.&lt;ref name="senatebrief"/&gt;  The press and counterseal were made by Edward Stabler, the postmaster at [[Sandy Spring, Maryland]] from 1830 until his death in 1883.  Stabler had engraved the seal for the [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] in 1830, and also would later make the seals for most federal government departments of the time, some states, and several municipalities.&lt;ref name="saltonstall"/&gt;

This second design was inspired by the then-popular Greek and Roman models, depicting three female figures which symbolized liberty, justice, and power. An eagle is above the figures, and twenty-four links of a chain bordering the seal represent the number of states then in the Union.&lt;ref name="senatebrief"/&gt;  The central [[Liberty (goddess)|Liberty]] figure is standing on a platform inscribed with &lt;small&gt;[[Independence Day (United States)|4 JULY 1776]]&lt;/small&gt;, and is holding a pole with a [[Phrygian cap]], a [[Palm branch (symbol)|palm branch]] of victory and rejoicing, and a scroll inscribed with &lt;small&gt;[[United States Constitution|CONSTITUTION, MARCH 4, 1789]]&lt;/small&gt;.  She is depicted in the process of walking, with one toe leaving the ground and her weight on her left foot. The [[Lady Justice|Justice]] figure is holding the scales of justice, and leaning on [[fasces]], a symbol of authority.  The Power figure holds a sword in her right hand, and a [[caduceus]] in her left, a symbol of commerce and peace.&lt;ref name="saltonstall"/&gt;

[[Image:US Capitol east center pediment.jpg|thumb|left|120px|''Genius of America'']]
[[Image:US-Senate-1831Seal-1885Engraving.png|thumb|140px|1885 engraving]]
The design has some similarities to ''Genius of America'', the sculpture over the central east pediment of the [[United States Capitol|Capitol building]] which had recently been completed.  Made by Luigi Persico from 1825 to 1828, it also features three female figures, representing America, Justice, and Hope.  Elements shared between the two designs include a July 4 pedestal, a scroll with a Constitution inscription, the scales of justice, and an eagle.

During the [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|1868 impeachment trial]] of President [[Andrew Johnson]], the seal was affixed to both the articles of impeachment and copies of documents submitted in evidence.   The second seal was used until 1880, when it was discovered "tucked away among some rubbish in one of the subterranean rooms of the Capitol" (apparently left there following heavy use during an 1876 impeachment trial).&lt;ref name="senateminute"/&gt;  By this time, the seal was well worn.  An engraving of the seal made for the March 26, 1885 edition of the ''[[Daily Graphic]]'' did not show either the 1776 or 1789 inscriptions, the scales of justice, nor a recognizable scroll, all presumably because these were no longer discernible on impressions made by the seal.&lt;ref name="saltonstall"/&gt;

===1886 Seal===
[[Image:US-Senate-1886Seal-Scan.png|thumb|180px|Seal used since 1886]]
The 1876 [[United States Centennial]] renewed interest in national symbols, which eventually prompted a redesign of the Great Seal in 1885.  On March 31, 1885, the Senate ordered an updating of its own seal.&lt;ref name="senateminute"/&gt;  During the discussions, many senators did not even know a Senate seal existed.&lt;ref&gt;In 1885, Senator [[William P. Frye]] remarked "The Senate is without any official seal.  There is only a legend of one, three women very slightly clothed, but it is only a legend." (noted in the ''[[Congressional Record]]'', vol. 17, p. 96.)  The final report for the new seal, after the earlier seal had been found, then said "No one has yet ever discovered what these figures were intended to typify, or what relevancy they had to the United States Senate or its proceedings."  (Senate Report No. 48, 49th Congress, 1st Session.)  This confusion was probably aided by the worn condition of the seal, which obscured several features which would have made the meaning more obvious.&lt;/ref&gt;

After considering several submitted designs, the Senate chose one by Louis Dreka, an engraver and stationer from [[Philadelphia]].  He was given $35 to make the press and seal, which measured one-and-a-half inches in diameter.  This design is the one still in use today.&lt;ref name="senatebrief"/&gt;  The physical seal itself is stored in a mahogany cabinet.&lt;ref name="saltonstall"/&gt;

There had never been any official declaration about who should use the seal, and under what circumstances.  This was also remedied at the time, with the ''[[Congressional Record]]'', vol. 17, p.&amp;nbsp;769 stating:&lt;ref name="saltonstall"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;Resolved, That the Secretary shall have the custody of the seal, and shall use the same for the authentication of process transcripts, copies, and certificates whenever directed by the Senate; and may use the same to authenticate copies of such papers and documents in his offices as he may lawfully give copies of.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In the twentieth century, the Secretary of the Senate has authorized official use of the seal by the majority and minority leaders.&lt;ref name="senatebrief"/&gt;

==Unofficial seals==

&lt;center&gt;

Image:Seal_of_the_Unites_States_Congress.svg
&lt;/gallery&gt;
&lt;/center&gt;

Because the official Senate seal is used only to authenticate official Senate documents, and not normally as a general visual symbol, the Secretary of the Senate has also authorized an alternative, non-official Senate seal. This alternative seal, which features an eagle clutching arrows and an olive branch in its talons, surrounded by the words "United States Senate," is commonly used by Senate offices and is often displayed on items sold in the Senate gift shop.  Even more commonly seen perhaps is a version of the [[Great Seal of the United States]] (which also depicts an eagle clutching arrows and an olive branch in its claws) surrounded by a similar inscription.&lt;ref name="ethicsmanual"/&gt;  These often appear on Senate web pages, on podiums when senators speak, and other situations.  The [[United States House of Representatives|House of Representatives]] also uses similar designs for their unofficial seals, and since the [[United States Congress]] as a whole does not have an official seal, similar designs are often used with a Congress inscription.&lt;ref name="cunningham"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/politics/cunningham/20050701-259-cunningh.html|title=Cunningham questioned over commercial use of congressional seal|date=2005-07-01|first=Stern|last=Marcus|author2=Kammer, Jerry |publisher=Copley News Service|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:MenendezLatinAmericaPressConference.jpg|thumb|Senator [[Bob Menendez]] press conference, with the alternate seal on the podium]]
Both the Senate Seal and the Great Seal are protected by 18 U.S.C. § 713, a criminal statute which restricts the knowing display of the Senate Seal or the Great Seal or any facsimile thereof in any manner reasonably calculated to convey a false impression of sponsorship or approval by the Government of the United States.&lt;ref name="usc"/&gt;  The Senate ethics manual states that in most cases use of the Senate Seal or the Great Seal for normal official Senate business would be appropriate; however, commercial use, personal use or campaign use by senators would be improper.  Additionally, campaign use of any of the unofficial, alternate seals would also be improper.  The manual suggests that senators who want to show a symbol of government on campaign material use a depiction of the [[United States Capitol]] dome.&lt;ref name="ethicsmanual"/&gt;  In 2005, Representative [[Duke Cunningham]] was found to be selling items on a personal web site which included the unofficial Congress seal, which were shortly thereafter discontinued.&lt;ref name="cunningham"/&gt;  Similarly, Senator [[Dick Durbin|Richard Durbin]] was dinged by a few [[blog]]gers after his campaign site showed a video message where an unofficial Senate seal (the Great Seal variant) appeared in one corner; the video was quickly taken down.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.noagenda.org/2007/08/durbin_netroots_video.php|title=Did Senator Durbin Violate Senate Ethics Rules?|first=Matt|last=Margolis|date=2007-08-05|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other Senate symbols==
===''Eagle and Shield''===
[[Image:US Senate Eagle and Shield gilded wood.jpg|thumb|''Eagle and Shield'']]
The ''Eagle and Shield'' is a gilded wood sculpture which is currently on the [[dais]] of the [[Old Senate Chamber]], as it was when the Senate used that room in the 1800s.  It dates from at least 1838, when it was referenced in a newspaper article and [[Daniel Webster]] speech, and may be from about 1834. The 1838 newspaper article includes a first-hand eyewitness account of its original installation in the Old Senate Chamber and attributes carving of the eagle and shield directly to Mr. [[Thomas C. Millard]] (1803-1870).&lt;ref&gt;Daily National Intelligencer, Washington, DC, Dec. 3, 1838&lt;/ref&gt; Millard was a New York City woodcarver who was active from the 1830s to 1860s and well known for his life-sized animals and human figures.&lt;ref&gt;Fried, Frederick, "Artists In Wood: American Carvers of Cigar-Store Indians, Show Figures, and Circus Wagons," Bramhall House, New York, 1970, pp. 177-8&lt;/ref&gt;  The eagle is life-sized at 53.5&amp;nbsp;inches (135.9&amp;nbsp;cm) high, 72&amp;nbsp;inches (182.9&amp;nbsp;cm) wide, and 23&amp;nbsp;inches (58.4&amp;nbsp;cm) deep, and the design is derived from the [[Great Seal of the United States]].  When the Senate moved to its new quarters in 1859 and the [[Supreme Court of the United States|Supreme Court]] took over use of the room, the shield was placed over one of the outside doors, while the eagle was placed elsewhere in the room.  In 1976, long after the Supreme Court moved to their own building, the two pieces were reunited and placed back on the dais when the chamber was restored.  It has become an enduring symbol of the Senate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/art/artifact/Sculpture_25_00003.htm|title=Eagle and Shield|publisher=[[United States Senate]]|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:US-Senate-Logo.svg|80px|left|Senate website logo]]
A stylized version has been used as a logo for the Senate on its website since 2006, and also from 1999 to 2002.  In the intervening period, the website used an image of the stained glass window of the official Senate seal.  The logo is also used on several online Senate publications.&lt;ref&gt;For example, a PDF document about the [https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/art/resources/pdf/Old_Senate_Chamber.pdf Old Senate Chamber] (PDF).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Senate gavel===
[[Image:US Senate gavels new box.jpg|thumb|180px|Old and new gavels in their box]]
[[Image:President_Pro_Tempore_US_Senate_Seal.svg|thumb|140px|The seal of the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President ''pro tempore'']]]]
The Senate [[gavel]] is wielded by the presiding officer of the Senate, usually either the [[Vice President of the United States|Vice President]] or [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate|President ''pro tempore'']], and is used to signify the commencement or adjournment of a Senate session.  It is made of ivory, has no handle, and is 2{{frac|1|2}}&amp;nbsp;inches high by 1{{frac|3|8}}&amp;nbsp;inches in diameter.  The original gavel was in use at least as far back as 1831, and according to one account was used by [[John Adams]] during the first Senate meetings on March 4, 1789.&lt;ref name="gavel"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/art/artifact/Other_71_00002.htm|title=Senate Gavel|publisher=[[United States Senate]]|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.c-span.org/questions/week108.asp|title=C-SPAN's Capitol Questions|date=2000-07-31|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The gavel deteriorated during the 1940s, and in 1952 silver pieces were attached to try to limit further damage.  However, in 1954, Vice President [[Richard Nixon]] pounded it during a heated debate over atomic energy, and it completely came apart.  Officials wanted to recreate the gavel exactly, but not enough ivory was available commercially; Senate officials therefore contacted the government of [[India]] for help in sourcing the correct amount of ivory.  On November 17, 1954, the [[Vice-President of India]], [[Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan]], presented the assembled Senate with a replacement gavel, which is still in use today.  It was a duplicate of the original, with the addition of a decorative floral band around the center.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.senate.gov/artandhistory/history/minute/The_Senates_New_Gavel.htm|title=The Senate's New Gavel|publisher=[[United States Senate]]|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.senate.gov/learning/brief_faq.html|title=Senate Briefings: Frequently Asked Questions|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20011202012516/https://www.senate.gov/learning/brief_faq.html|archivedate=2001-12-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Both the original and new gavels are stored in a mahogany box; each day a Senate page places the box on the presiding officer's desk.&lt;ref name="gavel"/&gt;

It has become customary to have new senators preside over the senate (and thus wield the gavel) in one-hour shifts so they can learn Senate procedures.  Usually this is limited to members of the majority party, but in periods where the Senate is evenly divided, senators from each party will often alternate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.senate.gov/reference/resources/pdf/Traditions.pdf|title=Traditions of the United States Senate|format=PDF|publisher=[[United States Senate]]|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://archives.cnn.com/2001/ALLPOLITICS/stories/01/24/hillary.senate/index.html|title=Hillary takes Senate gavel &amp;ndash; for an hour|publisher=CNN|date=2001-01-24|accessdate=2008-02-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The seal of the [[President pro tempore of the United States Senate]] includes a representation of the original gavel, with several depictions even showing its cracks, along with two quill pens and elements from the official Senate seal.

'''Sheikh Mohammad Rashid''', one of the founding fathers of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] (PPP) was regarded as an ideologue by thousands of PPP activists and was committed to a [[socialist]] cause.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian/&gt; This had earned him a reputed nickname in [[Lahore]] as ''Baba-e-Socialism'' (Father of Socialism).&lt;ref name=Dawn&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/57037 Senior PPP leader passes away] (Obituary and profile of Sheikh Mohammad Rashid) on Dawn (newspaper), Published 13 September 2002, Retrieved 30 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

But after the PPP's return to power, following long years of the military rule in the 1980s, Sheikh Rashid had gradually felt alienated within the party, despite being its one time '''Senior Vice Chairman'''.&lt;ref name=Dawn1/&gt;

==Early life and career==
Sheikh Mohammad Rashid was born in 1915 in [[Sheikhupura]] into a family of farmers  and entered politics by joining the [[All India Muslim League]] in 1940.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian/&gt; He was initially attracted by the [[Khaksar Tehrik]] but did not join it. Rashid also got involved in the [[Quit India Movement]] of the [[Ghadar Party]] led by [[Subhash Chandra Bose]].&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt; Locally in British-ruled Punjab, he participated in the movement against the pro-British [[Unionist Party (Punjab)|Unionist government]] of [[Khizar Hayat Khan Tiwana]]. In 1947 just before the independence of India and Pakistan, when religious and ethnic tensions arose and riots erupted, he formed a local "bombard group" against the Unionist government and was arrested while transporting some bombs in a ''tonga'' (a horse-driven vehicle commonly used at that time).&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt;

After the [[independence of Pakistan]] in 1947, Sheikh Rashid started his career as a lawyer but soon his socialist leanings led him to join the ''Azad Pakistan Party'' headed  by ''Pakistan Times'' newspaper owner [[Mian Iftikharuddin]].&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt; This organization had a broadly progressive programme and he was appointed its first ''secretary-general''. True to his socialist ideals, he also led many peasants movements in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt;
 
In 1967, he joined hands with the late [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] in the formation of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]].&lt;ref name=TheGuardian&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/news/2002/nov/07/guardianobituaries.pakistan Obituary of Sheikh Mohammad Rashid on The Guardian (UK newspaper)] Published 6 November 2002, Retrieved 30 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt; He was a founding member of the party's central executive committee and later a member of the first ever PPP cabinet, initially as Health Minister and then Chairman of the Land Reforms Commission. His efforts at land reforms were said to have made him unpopular with many including some of his own land-owning party colleagues because he confiscated, as ''Federal Land Reforms Commission'' chairman, thousands of acres of land of big landowners of Pakistan regardless of what political party they belonged to. Zulfikar Ali Bhutto himself was a big landowner in [[Sindh]].&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt; Eventually, the land reforms saw only a half-hearted implementation by the Bhutto administration. Besides Bhutto, Pakistan has been a land of too many influential feudal lords and stiff resistance was expected from them anyway to any socialist-type land reforms.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian/&gt;

He was elected twice as member of the [[National Assembly of Pakistan]] on Pakistan Peoples' Party tickets both in [[1970 General Election in Pakistan]] and [[Pakistani general election, 1977]].&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt;

Sheikh Mohammad Rashid remained close to the then Prime Minister [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]], who treated him as his most senior cabinet colleague, perhaps to retain a balance between the progressive and conservative elements within the party.  It was during the period of General [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq]] as the military ruler, that Sheikh Rashid's role as an ideologue for thousands of party workers, was boosted.

Once the Bhutto government was overthrown by General Zia-ul-Haq, Pakistan Peoples Party workers including Rashid were repressed and he spent many years in exile in Britain.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian/&gt; Then in September 1988, General Zia died in a mysterious plane crash and attempts at restoring democracy to Pakistan were made. Benazir Bhutto returned triumphantly to Pakistan to campaign for the upcoming [[Pakistani general election, 1988]].

==Out of tune with Benazir Bhutto==
Sheikh Mohammad Rashid failed to get re-elected in the 1988 national election. He was getting old and was in poor health with asthma. Another reason given for his election defeat was that 1988 election was manipulated by Pakistan's intelligence agencies.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian/&gt; However, the PPP's return to power in 1988 marked the beginning of his gradual alienation with Prime Minister [[Benazir Bhutto]], who regarded his socialist ideals as being increasingly out of tune with contemporary trends. Despite ideological differences with the leadership, Sheikh Mohammad Rashid, unlike many other fellow party members, remained steadfast with his commitment to the party and never joined any other political group.&lt;ref name=Dawn1/&gt; He was refused a PPP party ticket to contest the 1990 elections in Pakistan.&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt;

==Death and legacy==
Sheikh Mohammad Rashid had asthma for a long time and finally died in [[Lahore]], aged 87, on 12 September 2002. His survivors included his wife Shakeela and his four sons from his previous marriage.&lt;ref name=TheGuardian/&gt;

===An uncompromising socialist===
In the early years of Pakistan, there is an often told story of a debate on the party's drafted charter that [[Faiz Ahmed Faiz]] had drafted for the ''Azad Pakistan Party''. Everyone accepted Faiz's draft but Sheikh Rashid. This debate took place among the founders of the party over a word which Sheikh Rashid alone wanted changed. Of course the word was about the distribution of land among the peasants. He debated the rest of the party founders over it for many hours because he wanted it expressed a certain way. All through his political career, he was recognized by his contemporaries as a defender of peasant rights.&lt;ref name=Dawn1&gt;[https://www.dawn.com/news/114964 The fighter Sheikh Rashid was] Dawn (newspaper), Published 12 September 2003, Retrieved 30 December 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheikh Mohammad Rashid was ridiculed in the early 1970s for trying to bring a generic drugs scheme to Pakistan. Although his idea was proven valid later because similar generic drug schemes were later implemented in many countries including [[Egypt]], [[Bangladesh]] and it was endorsed by the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO).&lt;ref name=Dawn/&gt; Now some people feel in Pakistan that his idea was in common public's interest.&lt;ref name=Dawn1/&gt;

Sheikh Rashid was among the first to advise Bhutto to accept [[Sheikh Mujibur Rahman]]'s ''Six Point Program'' which later became [[Six point movement]] to achieve greater autonomy for East Pakistan. This movement finally resulted in separation of former [[East Pakistan]] becoming [[Bangladesh]] in 1971.&lt;ref name=Dawn1/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3297">'''Sinistrisme''' ({{IPA-fr|sinistʁism|lang}}) is a [[neologism]] invented by [[Albert Thibaudet]] in ''Les idées politiques de la France'' (1932). He referred to the progressive substitution of [[left wing]] parties by new, more radical parties, which in turn pushed each party towards the center (the [[Radical-Socialist Party (France)|Radical Party]] being replaced by the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO, a socialist party), the Socialists by the [[French Communist Party]], etc.). This historical movement (seen by Thibaudet as a historical necessity) thus explained, according to Thibaudet, the tendency of the [[right-wing]], in particular in [[France]], to disavow the label ''droite'' (right), long associated in [[French history]] with [[monarchism]], in favour of ''left''.  

Hence, those who rallied to the [[French Third Republic|Republic]] in 1893 still adopted the denomination ''Droite constitutionnelle'' or ''républicaine'' (Constitutional or Republican Right), but replaced it in 1899 by ''[[Action libérale]]'', under which they went to the 1902 elections. An explicit right wing group resurged in 1910, gathering the last nostalgics of the [[monarchism|monarchy]]. According to historian [[René Rémond]], since 1924 the term "right wing" vanished from the parliamentary group's glossary. Deputies from the [[Democratic Republican Alliance]] (ARD), which was the main [[center-right]] parliamentary formation under the [[French Third Republic|Third Republic]], sat in the parliamentary group of "Left-wing Republicans". Following the Liberation, the [[Rally of Left Republicans]] (RGR) gathered conservative deputies, mostly from the [[Radical Party (France)|Radical-Socialist Party]] (and opponents of [[Pierre Mendès-France]] as well as [[Independent Radicals]] who had left the Radical Party in 1928, opposed to its alliance with the left-wing during the [[Cartel des gauches]]), and from the [[UDSR]]. 

René Rémond remarked that "at the [[French presidential election, 1974|1974 presidential election]], only one candidate declared himself as belonging to the right-wing: [[Jean-Marie Le Pen]]; in [[French presidential election, 1981|1981, no one]]."&lt;ref&gt; [[René Rémond]], ''Les Droites en France'', p.391, Aubier, 1982 &amp;mdash; new edition of ''La Droite en France'', 1954 &lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Conservatism|Conservative]]'' (which had been the name of an [[ultra-royalist]] review in 1818-1820) was a synonym of "right wing" often used under the Third Republic, in particular by the ''[[Bloc national]]'' Chamber. ''Independents'', used in the 1920s for deputies close to the ''[[Action française]]'' royalist movement, was later used by less [[reactionary]] politicians.

'''Social democracy''' is a political, social and economic ideology that supports [[Economic interventionism|economic]] and [[Social interventionism|social interventions]] to promote [[social justice]] within the framework of a [[liberal democracy|liberal democratic]] [[polity]] and [[capitalist]] economy. The protocols and norms used to accomplish this involve a commitment to [[Representative democracy|representative]] and [[participatory democracy]]; measures for [[income redistribution]] and [[Regulatory economics|regulation of the economy]] in the [[Common good|general interest]]; and [[welfare state]] provisions.{{sfn|Heywood|2012|p=128|ps=: "Social democracy is an ideological stance that supports a broad balance between market capitalism, on the one hand, and state intervention, on the other hand. Being based on a compromise between the market and the state, social democracy lacks a systematic underlying theory and is, arguably, inherently vague. It is nevertheless associated with the following views: (1) capitalism is the only reliable means of generating wealth, but it is a morally defective means of distributing wealth because of its tendency towards poverty and inequality; (2) the defects of the capitalist system can be rectified through economic and social intervention, the state being the custodian of the public interest [...]"}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1998|p=827}}: "The idea of social democracy is now used to describe a society the economy of which is predominantly capitalist, but where the state acts to regulate the economy in the general interest, provides welfare services outside of it and attempts to alter the distribution of income and wealth in the name of social justice."&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Badie|Berg-Schlosser|Morlino|2011|p=2423|ps=: "Social democracy refers to a political tendency resting on three fundamental features: (1) democracy (e.g., equal rights to vote and form parties), (2) an economy partly regulated by the state (e.g., through Keynesianism), and (3) a welfare state offering social support to those in need (e.g., equal rights to education, health service, employment and pensions)."}} Social democracy thus aims to create the conditions for capitalism to lead to greater democratic, [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] and [[Solidarity|solidaristic]] outcomes.{{sfn|Weisskopf|1992|p=10|ps=: "Thus social democrats do not try to do away with either the market or private property ownership; instead, they attempt to create conditions in which the operation of a capitalist market economy will lead to more egalitarian outcomes and encourage more democratic and more solidaristic practices than would a more conventional capitalist system."}} Due to longstanding governance by Social Democratic parties and their influence on socioeconomic policy development in the [[Nordic countries]], in policy circles "social democracy" has become associated with the [[Nordic model]] in the latter part of the 20th century.{{sfnm|1a1=Gombert|1a2=Bläsius|1a3=Krell|1a4=Timpe|1y=2009|1p=8|2a1=Sejersted|2y=2011}}

Social democracy originated as a political ideology that advocated an [[Reformism|evolutionary]] and peaceful transition from capitalism to [[socialism]] using established political processes in contrast to the [[revolutionary socialism|revolutionary approach to transition]] associated with [[orthodox Marxism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/topic/social-democracy|title=Social democracy|publisher=''Encyclopædia Britannica''|accessdate=10 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the early [[post-war]] era in Western Europe, social democratic parties rejected the Stalinist political and economic model then current in the Soviet Union, committing themselves either to an alternative path to socialism or to a compromise between capitalism and socialism.{{sfn|Adams|1993|pp=102-103|ps=: "The emergence of social democracy was partly a result of the Cold War. People argued that if the Stalinist Soviet empire, where the state controlled everything, showed socialism in action, then socialism was not worth having. [...] The consensus policies of a mixed and managed economy and the welfare state, developed by the post-war Labour government, seemed in themselves to provide a basis for a viable socialism that would combine prosperity and freedom with social justice and the possibility of a full life for everyone. They could be seen as a compromise between socialism and capitalism."}} In this period, social democrats embraced a [[mixed economy]] based on the predominance of [[private property]], with only a minority of essential utilities and public services under public ownership. As a result, social democracy became associated with [[Keynesian economics]], state interventionism and the welfare state, while abandoning the prior goal of replacing the capitalist system (factor markets, [[private property]] and wage labor){{sfn|Weisskopf|1992|p=10|ps=: "Thus social democrats do not try to do away with either the market or private property ownership; instead, they attempt to create conditions in which the operation of a capitalist market economy will lead to more egalitarian outcomes and encourage more democratic and more solidaristic practices than would a more conventional capitalist system."}} with a qualitatively different socialist [[economic system]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1998|p=827}}: "In the second, mainly post-war, phase, social democrats came to believe that their ideals and values could be achieved by reforming capitalism rather than abolishing it. They favored a mixed economy in which most industries would be privately owned, with only a small number of utilities and other essential services in public ownership."&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Jones|2001|p=1410|ps=: "In addition, particularly since World War II, distinctions have sometimes been made between social democrats and socialists on the basis that the former have accepted the permanence of the mixed economy and have abandoned the idea of replacing the capitalist system with a qualitatively different socialist society."}}{{sfn|Heywood|2012|pp=125–128|ps=: "As an ideological stance, social democracy took shape around the mid-twentieth century, resulting from the tendency among western socialist parties not only to adopt parliamentary strategies, but also to revise their socialist goals. In particular, they abandoned the goal of abolishing capitalism and sought instead to reform or ‘humanize’ it. Social democracy therefore came to stand for a broad balance between the market economy, on the one hand, and state intervention, on the other."}}

Modern social democracy is characterized by a commitment to policies aimed at curbing [[Social inequality|inequality]], [[oppression]] of [[Privilege (social inequality)|underprivileged groups]] and [[poverty]],{{sfn|Hoefer|2013|p=29}} including support for universally accessible [[Public service|public services]] like [[Elderly care|care for the elderly]], [[child care]], [[Universal education|education]], [[Universal health care|health care]] and [[workers' compensation]].{{sfn|Meyer|Hinchman|2007|p=137}} The social democratic movement often has strong connections with the [[labour movement]] and [[trade union]]s which are supportive of collective bargaining rights for workers as well as measures to extend decision-making beyond politics into the economic sphere in the form of [[co-determination]] for employees and other economic stakeholders.{{sfnm|1a1=Meyer|1a2=Hinchman|1y=2007|1p=91|2a1=Upchurch|2a2=Taylor|2a3=Mathers|2y=2009|2p=51}}

The [[Third Way]] is an ideology developed in the 1990s that aims to fuse [[Economic liberalism|liberal economics]] with social democratic [[welfare]] policies. Many social democratic parties have incorporated the ideology, though the term 'Third Way' has generally fallen out of favour.

== Development of social democracy ==
{{Socialism sidebar|expanded=Variants}}
[[File:Social-democracy-before-ww2.svg|thumb|Development of German Social Democracy before World War II]]
During late 19th and early 20th centuries, social democracy was a movement that aimed to replace private ownership with [[social ownership]] of the means of production, taking influences from both [[Marxism]] and the supporters of [[Ferdinand Lassalle]]. By 1868–1869, Marxism had become the official theoretical basis of the first social democratic party established in Europe, the [[Social Democratic Workers' Party of Germany]] (SDAP).{{sfn|Schorske|1993|p=2}}

In the early 20th century, the German social democratic politician [[Eduard Bernstein]] rejected the [[Proletarian revolution|revolutionary]] and [[Historical materialism|materialist]] foundations of classical and orthodox Marxism and advanced the position that socialism should be grounded in [[Ethical socialism|ethical and moral arguments]] and was to be achieved through [[Gradualism|gradual]] legislative reform. Influenced by Bernstein, following the split between [[Reformism|reformists]] and [[revolutionary socialist]]s in the [[Second International]], social democratic parties rejected revolutionary politics in favor of parliamentary reform while remaining committed to socialization.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Miller|1998|p=827}}: "In this (first) phase, therefore, the final aim of social democracy was to replace private ownership of industry with state or social ownership, but the means were to be those of parliamentary democracy."&lt;/ref&gt; In this period, social democracy became associated with reformist socialism. Under the influence of politicians like [[Carlo Rosselli]] in Italy, social democrats began disassociating themselves from Marxism altogether and embraced [[liberal socialism]],{{sfn|Bronner|1999|p=103}} appealing to morality instead of any consistent systematic, scientific or [[materialist]] worldview.{{sfn|Wright|1999|p=86|ps=: "This was an ideology which, at bottom, was grounded not in materialism but in morals. Thus Bernstein summoned up Kant to point the way towards a politics of ethical choices."}}&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Heywood|2012|p=128}}: "The theoretical basis for social democracy has been provided more by moral or religious beliefs, rather than by scientific analysis. Social democrats have not accepted the materialist and highly systematic ideas of Marx and Engels, but rather advanced an essentially moral critique of capitalism."&lt;/ref&gt; Social democracy made appeals to [[communitarian]], [[corporatist]] and sometimes [[nationalist]] sentiments while rejecting the economic and [[technological determinism]] generally characteristic of both Marxism and [[economic liberalism]].{{sfn|Berman|2008|pp=12–13|ps=: "Regardless of the specific policies they advocated, one thing that joined all budding interwar social democrats was a rejection of the passivity and economic determinism of orthodox Marxism [...] so they often embraced communitarian, corporatist, and even nationalist appeals and urged their parties to make the transition from workers' to 'people's' parties."}} By the post-[[World War II]] period, most social democrats in Europe had abandoned their ideological connection to Marxism and shifted their emphasis toward social policy reform in place of transition from capitalism to socialism.{{sfn|Adams|1993|p=146}}

=== First International era (1863–1889) ===
The origins of social democracy have been traced to the 1860s, with the rise of the first major working-class party in Europe, the [[General German Workers' Association]] (ADAV) founded by [[Ferdinand Lassalle]].{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=284}} 1864 saw the founding of the [[International Workingmen's Association]], also known as the [[First International]]. It brought together socialists of various stances and initially occasioned a conflict between [[Karl Marx]] and the [[Anarchism|anarchists]] led by [[Mikhail Bakunin]] over the role of the state in socialism, with Bakunin rejecting any role for the state.{{sfn|Ishay|2008|p=148}} Another issue in the First International was the role of reformism.{{sfn|Ishay|2008|p=149–150}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 183-R66693, Ferdinand Lassalle.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ferdinand Lassalle]]]]
Although Lassalle was not a Marxist, he was influenced by the theories of Marx and [[Friedrich Engels]] and he accepted the existence and importance of [[class struggle]]. However, unlike Marx's and Engels's ''[[The Communist Manifesto]]'', Lassalle promoted class struggle in a more moderate form.{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=52}} While Marx viewed the state negatively as an instrument of class rule that should only exist temporarily upon the rise to power of the proletariat and then dismantled, Lassalle accepted the state. Lassalle viewed the state as a means through which workers could enhance their interests and even transform the society to create an economy based on worker-run cooperatives. Lassalle's strategy was primarily electoral and reformist, with Lassalleans contending that the working class needed a political party that fought above all for universal adult male suffrage.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=284}}

The ADAV's party newspaper was called ''Der Sozialdemokrat'' (''The Social Democrat''). Marx and Engels responded to the title ''Sozialdemocrat'' with distaste, Engels once writing: "But what a title: ''Sozialdemokrat''!...Why don't they simply call it ''The Proletarian''". Marx agreed with Engels that ''Sozialdemokrat'' was a bad title.{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=52}} Although the origins of the name ''Sozialdemokrat'' actually traced back to Marx's German translation in 1848 of the French political party known as the [[The Mountain (1849)|Democratic Socialists]] (''Partie Democrat-Socialist'') into ''Partei der Sozialdemokratie'', Marx did not like this French party because he viewed it as dominated by the middle class and associated the word ''Sozialdemokrat'' with that party.{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=53}} There was a Marxist faction within the ADAV represented by [[Wilhelm Liebknecht]] who became one of the editors of the ''Der Sozialdemokrat''.{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=52}}

Faced with opposition from liberal capitalists to his socialist policies, Lassalle controversially attempted to forge a tactical alliance with the conservative aristocratic [[Junker]]s due to their anti-bourgeois attitudes as well as with Prussian Chancellor [[Otto von Bismarck]].{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=284}} Friction in the ADAV arose over Lassalle's policy of a friendly approach to Bismarck that had assumed incorrectly that Bismarck in turn would be friendly towards them. This approach was opposed by the party's Marxists, including Liebknecht.{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=53}} Opposition in the ADAV to Lassalle's friendly approach to Bismarck's government resulted in Liebknecht resigning from his position as editor of ''Die Sozialdemokrat'' and leaving the ADAV in 1865. In 1869, Liebknecht, along with Marxist [[August Bebel]], founded the SDAP, which was founded as a merger of three groups: the [[petit-bourgeois]] [[Saxon People's Party]] (SVP), a faction of the ADAV; and members of the League of German Workers' Associations (VDA).{{sfn|Aspalter|2001|p=53}}

Though the SDAP was not officially Marxist, it was the first major working-class organization to be led by Marxists and Marx and Engels had direct association with the party. The party adopted stances similar to those adopted by Marx at the First International. There was intense rivalry and antagonism between the SDAP and the ADAV, with the SDAP being highly hostile to the Prussian government while the ADAV pursued a reformist and more cooperative approach.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|pp=285–286}} This rivalry reached its height involving the two parties' stances on the [[Franco-Prussian War]], with the SDAP refusing to support Prussia's war effort by claiming it was an imperialist war pursued by Bismarck, while the ADAV supported the war.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|pp=285–286}}

[[File:Barricade18March1871.jpg|thumb|left|A barricade in Paris in March 1871, set up by revolutionary forces of the [[Paris Commune]]]]
In the aftermath of the defeat of France in the Franco-Prussian War, revolution broke out in France, with revolutionary army members along with working-class revolutionaries founding the [[Paris Commune]].{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=219}} The Paris Commune appealed both to the citizens of Paris regardless of class as well as to the working class who were a major base of support for the government by appealing to them via militant rhetoric. In spite of such militant rhetoric to appeal to the working class, the Commune also received substantial support from the middle class bourgeoisie of Paris, including shopkeepers and merchants. The Commune, in part due to its sizable number neo-[[Pierre-Joseph Proudhon|Proudhon]]ians and [[neo-Jacobin]]s in the Central Committee, declared that the Commune was not opposed to private property, but rather hoped to create the widest distribution of it.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=225}} The political composition of the Commune included twenty-five neo-Jacobins, fifteen to twenty neo-Proudhonians and [[Syndicalism|protosyndicalists]], nine or ten [[Blanquism|Blanquists]], a variety of [[Radicalism (historical)#France|radical republicans]] and a few Internationalists influenced by Marx.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=229}}

In the aftermath of the collapse of the Paris Commune in 1871, Marx praised the Paris Commune in his work ''[[The Civil War in France]]'' (1871) for its achievements in spite of its pro-bourgeois influences and called it an excellent model of the [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] in practice, as it had dismantled the apparatus of the bourgeois state, including its huge bureaucracy; military; and its executive, judicial and legislative institutions; and replaced it with a working-class state with broad popular support.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=256}} However, the collapse of the Commune and the persecution of its anarchist supporters had the effect of weakening the influence of the Bakuninist anarchists in the First International, which resulted in Marx expelling the weakened rival Bakuninists from the International a year later.{{sfn|Bookchin|1998|p=256}}

In Britain, the achievement of legalisation of trade unions under the [[Trade Union Act 1871]] drew British trade unionists to believe that working conditions could be improved through parliamentary means.{{sfn|Ishay|2008|p=149}} At the [[Hague Congress (1872)|Hague Congress of 1872]], Marx made a remark, admitting that while there are countries "where the workers can attain their goal by peaceful means" in most countries on the Continent "the lever of our revolution must be force":{{sfn|Johnson|Walker|Gray|2014|pp=119–120}} {{quote|You know that the institutions, mores, and traditions of various countries must be taken into consideration, and we do not deny that there are countries—such as America, England, and if I were more familiar with your institutions, I would perhaps also add Holland—where the workers can attain their goal by peaceful means. This being the case, we must also recognize the fact that in most countries on the Continent the lever of our revolution must be force; it is force to which we must someday appeal in order to erect the rule of labor.{{sfnm|1a1=Johnson|1a2=Walker|1a3=Gray|1y=2014|1pp=119–120|2a1=Marx|2y=1972|2p=64}}}}

In 1875, Marx attacked the [[Gotha Program]] that became the program of [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] (SDP) in the same year in his ''[[Critique of the Gotha Program]]''. Marx was not optimistic that Germany at the time was open to a peaceful means to achieve socialism, especially after German Chancellor Otto von Bismarck had enacted [[Anti-Socialist Laws]] in 1878.{{sfn|Hollander|2011|p=201}} At the time of the Anti-Socialist Laws beginning to be drafted but not yet published in 1878, Marx spoke of the possibilities of legislative reforms by an elected government composed of working-class legislative members, but also of the willingness to use force should force be used against the working class:{{quote|If in England, for instance, or the United States, the working class were to gain a majority in Parliament or Congress, they could, by lawful means, rid themselves of such laws and institutions as impeded their development, though they could only do insofar as society had reached a sufficiently mature development. However, the "peaceful" movement might be transformed into a "forcible" one by resistance on the part of those interested in restoring the former state of affairs; if (as in the American Civil War and French Revolution) they are put down by force, it is as rebels against "lawful" force.{{sfn|Hollander|2011|p=201}}}}

In his study ''England in 1845 and in 1885'' (1885), Engels wrote a study that analysed the changes in the British class system from 1845 to 1885, in which he commended the [[Chartist movement]] for being responsible for the achievement of major breakthroughs for the working class.{{sfn|Hollander|2011|p=208}} Engels stated that during this time Britain's industrial bourgeoisie had learned "that the middle class can never obtain full social and political power over the nation except by the help of the working class".{{sfn|Hollander|2011|p=201}} In addition, he noticed "a gradual change over the relations between the two classes".&lt;ref name="Samuel Hollander, p. 208 quotes"&gt;{{cite book |last=Engels |first=Friedrich |author-link=Friedrich Engels |year=1885 |title=England in 1845 and in 1885}} Cited in {{harvnb|Hollander|2011|p=208}}.&lt;/ref&gt; This change he described was manifested in the change of laws in Britain that granted political changes in favour of the working class that the Chartist movement had demanded for years: {{quote|The 'Abolition of the Property Qualification' and 'Vote by Ballot' are now the law of the land.

[[File:Sidney Webb.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Sidney Webb]], a prominent [[Fabian Society|Fabian socialist]]]]
A major non-Marxian influence on social democracy came from the British [[Fabian Society]] founded in 1884 by [[Frank Podmore]] that emphasised the need for a gradualist evolutionary and reformist approach to the achievement of socialism.{{sfn|Busky|2000|pp=87–90}} The Fabian Society was founded as a splinter group from the [[Fellowship of the New Life]] due to opposition within that group to socialism.{{sfn|Britain|2005|p=29}} Unlike Marxism, Fabianism did not promote itself as a working-class-led movement and it largely had middle-class members.{{sfn|Clapson|2009|p=328}} The Fabian Society published the ''Fabian Essays on Socialism'' (1889) that was substantially written by [[George Bernard Shaw]].{{sfn|Britain|2005|p=14}} Shaw referred to Fabians as "all Social Democrats, with a common confiction{{sic}} of the necessity of vesting the organization of industry and the material of production in a State identified with the whole people by complete Democracy".{{sfn|Britain|2005|p=14}} Other important early Fabians included [[Sidney Webb]], who from 1887 to 1891 wrote the bulk of the Society's official policies.{{sfn|Britain|2005|pp=14, 29}} Fabianism would become a major influence on the British labour movement.{{sfn|Clapson|2009|p=328}}

=== Second International era: reform or revolution dispute (1889–1914) ===
The modern social democratic movement came into being through a division within the socialist movement: this division can be described as a parting of ways between those who insisted upon political revolution as a precondition for the achievement of socialist goals and those who maintained that a gradual or evolutionary path to socialism was both possible and desirable.{{sfn|Berman|2008}}

[[File:James Keir Hardie by John Furley Lewis, 1902.jpg|thumb|upright|left|[[Keir Hardie]]]]
The influence of the Fabian Society in Britain grew in the British socialist movement in the 1890s, especially within the [[Independent Labour Party]] (ILP) founded in 1893.{{sfn|McBriar|1962|pp=290–291}} Important ILP members were affiliated with the Fabian Society, including [[Keir Hardie]] and [[Ramsay MacDonald]]—the future British Prime Minister.{{sfn|McBriar|1962|pp=290–291}} Fabian influence in British government affairs also emerged, such as Fabian member Sidney Webb being chosen to take part in writing what became the Minority Report of the Royal Commission on Labour.{{sfn|McBriar|1962|p=291}} While Hardie was nominally a member of the Fabian Society, as leader of the ILP he had close relations with certain Fabians, such as Shaw, while he was antagonistic to others such as the Webbs.{{sfn|McBriar|1962|p=295}} As ILP leader, Hardie rejected revolutionary politics while declaring that he believed the party's tactics should be "as constitutional as the Fabians".{{sfn|McBriar|1962|p=295}}

Another important Fabian figure who joined the ILP was [[Robert Blatchford]] who wrote the work ''[[Merrie England (book)|Merrie England]]'' (1894) that endorsed [[municipal socialism]].{{sfn|McBriar|1962|p=296}} ''Merrie England'' was a major publication that sold 750,000 copies within one year.{{sfn|Ward|1998|p=27}} In ''Merrie England'', Blatchford distinguished two types of socialism: an "ideal socialism" and a "practical socialism".{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=21}} Blatchford's practical socialism was a state socialism that identified existing state enterprise such as the [[Post Office]] run by the municipalities as a demonstration of practical socialism in action, he claimed that practical socialism should involve the extension of state enterprise to the means of production as common property of the people.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=21}} While endorsing state socialism, Blatchford's ''Merrie England'' and his other writings were influenced by [[Anarchist communism|anarchist communist]] [[William Morris]]—as Blatchford himself attested to—and Morris' anarchist communist themes are present in ''Merrie England''.{{sfn|Thompson|2006|p=21}}

Shaw published the ''Report on Fabian Policy'' (1896) that declared: "The Fabian Society does not suggest that the State should monopolize industry as against private enterprise or individual initiative".{{sfn|Blaazer|2002|pp=59–60}}

Major developments in social democracy as a whole emerged with the ascendance of [[Eduard Bernstein]] as a proponent of [[Reformism|reformist]] socialism and an adherent of Marxism.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=42}} Bernstein had resided in Britain in the 1880s at the time when Fabianism was arising and is believed to have been strongly influenced by Fabianism.{{sfn|McBriar|1962|p=71}} However, he publicly denied having strong Fabian influences on his thought.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=67}} Bernstein did acknowledge that he was influenced by [[Kantianism|Kantian]] [[Epistemology|epistemological]] [[Philosophical skepticism|skepticism]] while he rejected [[Hegelianism]]. He and his supporters urged the Social Democratic Party of Germany to merge Kantian ethics with Marxian [[political economy]].{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=116}} On the role of Kantian criticism within socialism, Bernstein said: {{quote|The method of this great philosopher [Kant] can serve as a pointer to the satisfying solution to our problem. Of course we don’t have to slavishly adhere to Kant's form, but we must match his method to the nature of our own subject [socialism], displaying the same critical spirit. Our critique must be direct against both a scepticism that undermines all theoretical thought, and a dogmatism that relies on ready-made formulas.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=116}}}}

[[File:Karl Kautsky 01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Karl Kautsky]]]]
The term "[[Revisionism (Marxism)|revisionist]]" was applied to Bernstein by his critics who referred to themselves as [[Orthodox Marxism|"orthodox" Marxists]], even though Bernstein claimed that his principles were consistent with Marx's and Engels' stances, especially in their later years when they advocated that socialism should be achieved through parliamentary democratic means wherever possible.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=42}} Bernstein and his faction of revisionists criticized orthodox Marxism and particularly its founder [[Karl Kautsky]] for having disregarded Marx's view of the necessity of evolution of capitalism to achieve socialism by replacing it with an "either/or" polarization between capitalism and socialism, claiming that Kautsky disregarded Marx's emphasis on the role of parliamentary democracy in achieving socialism, as well as criticizing Kautsky for his idealisation of [[state socialism]].{{sfn|Harrington|2011|pp=43–59}} However, Kautsky did not deny a role for democracy in the achievement of socialism, as he claimed that Marx's [[dictatorship of the proletariat]] was not a form of government that rejected democracy as critics had claimed it was, but a [[State of affairs (sociology)|state of affairs]] that Marx expected would arise should the proletariat gain power and be faced with fighting a violent [[reactionary]] opposition.{{sfn|Ishay|2008|p=148}}

Bernstein had held close association to Marx and Engels, but he saw flaws in Marxian thinking and began such criticism when he investigated and challenged the Marxian [[Historical materialism|materialist theory of history]].{{sfn|Berman|2006|pp=38–39}} He rejected significant parts of Marxian theory that were based upon [[Hegelian]] [[metaphysics]] and he also rejected the [[Hegelian dialectic]]al perspective.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=251}} Bernstein distinguished between early Marxism as being its immature form: as exemplified by ''The Communist Manifesto'' written by Marx and Engels in their youth, that he opposed for what he regarded as its violent [[Blanquism|Blanquist]] tendencies; and later Marxism as being its mature form that he supported.{{sfn|Steger|1997|pp=236–237}}

Bernstein declared that the massive and [[homogeneous]] working class claimed in the ''Communist Manifesto'' did not exist and that—contrary to claims of a proletarian majority emerging—the middle class was growing under capitalism and not disappearing as Marx had claimed. Bernstein noted that the working class was not homogeneous but heterogeneous, with divisions and factions within it, including socialist and non-socialist trade unions. In his work ''[[Theories of Surplus Value]]'', Marx himself later in his life acknowledged that the middle class was not disappearing, but due to the popularity of the ''Communist Manifesto'' and the obscurity of ''Theories of Surplus Value'' Marx's acknowledgement of this error is not well known.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|pp=249–250}}

[[File:Bernstein Eduard 1895.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Eduard Bernstein]]]]
Bernstein criticized Marxism's concept of "irreconciliable [[class conflict]]s" and Marxism's hostility to [[liberalism]].{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=133}} He challenged Marx's position on liberalism by claiming that [[Liberal democracy|liberal democrats]] and social democrats held common grounds that he claimed could be utilized to create a "socialist republic".{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=133}} He believed that economic class disparities between the [[bourgeoisie]] and the [[proletariat]] would gradually be eliminated through legal reforms and economic redistribution programs.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=133}} Bernstein rejected the Marxian principle of [[dictatorship of the proletariat]], claiming that gradualist democratic reforms will improve the rights of the [[working class]].{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=141}} According to Bernstein—unlike orthodox Marxism—social democracy did not seek to create a socialism separate from bourgeois society, but instead sought to create a common development based on Western humanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wright|1999|p=86}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The development of socialism under social democracy does not seek to rupture existing society and its cultural traditions, but to act as an enterprise of extension and growth.{{sfn|Wright|1999|p=88}} Furthermore, he believed that class cooperation was a preferable course to achieve socialism, rather than class conflict.{{sfn|Berman|2006|p=2}}

Bernstein responded to critics that he was not destroying Marxism, but claimed that he was "modernizing Marxism" that was required "to separate the vital parts of [Marx's] theory from its outdated accessories". He asserted his support for the Marxian conception of a "scientifically based" socialist movement and said that such a movement's goals must be determined in accordance with "knowledge capable of objective proof, that is, knowledge which refers to, and conforms with, nothing but empirical knowledge and logic". As such, Bernstein was strongly opposed to [[dogmatism]] within the Marxist movement.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=96}} Despite embracing a mixed economy, Bernstein was skeptical and critical of welfare state policies, believing them to be helpful, but ultimately secondary to the main social democratic goal of replacing capitalism with socialism, fearing that state aid to the unemployed might lead to the sanctioning of a new form of [[pauperism]].{{sfn|Jackson|2008|ps=: "Bernstein was also cautious about the use of social spending to ameliorate capitalism; he ranked what would later be called the 'welfare state' as a helpful intervention, but ultimately secondary to more decisive policies intended to attack the source of poverty and inequality. He expressed skepticism about state aid to the unemployed, for example, which he feared might merely sanction a new form of 'pauperism'."}}

[[File:Rosa Luxemburg.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Rosa Luxemburg]]]]
Representing revolutionary socialism, [[Rosa Luxemburg]] staunchly condemned Bernstein's revisionism and reformism for being based on "opportunism in social democracy". She likened Bernstein's policies to that of the dispute between Marxists and the opportunistic ''Praktiker'' ("pragmatists"). She denounced Bernstein's evolutionary socialism for being a "petty-bourgeois vulgarization of Marxism". She claimed that Bernstein's years of exile in Britain had made him lose familiarity with the situation in Germany where he was promoting evolutionary socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=154}} Luxemburg sought to maintain social democracy as a revolutionary Marxist creed, saying: {{quote|[T]here could be no socialism—at least in Germany—outside of Marxist socialism, and there could be no socialist class struggle outside of social democracy. From then on [the emergence of Marx's theory], socialism and Marxism, the proletarian struggle for emancipation, and social democracy were identical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Luxemburg|first=Rosa|author-link=Rosa Luxemburg|title=Reform or Revolution|page=60|title-link=Reform or Revolution}} Cited in {{harvnb|Steger|1997|p=96}}.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Both Kautsky and Luxemburg condemned Bernstein for his "flawed" philosophy of science for having abandoned Hegelian dialectics for Kantian philosophical dualism. Russian Marxist [[George Plekhanov]] joined Kautsky and Luxemburg in condemning Bernstein for having a neo-Kantian philosophy.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=96}} Kautsky and Luxemburg contended that Bernstein's empiricist viewpoints depersonalized and dehistoricized the social observer and reducing objects down to "facts". Luxemburg associated Bernstein with "[[Ethical socialism|ethical socialists]]" who she identified as being associated with the bourgeoisie and Kantian liberalism.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=115}}

In his introduction to the 1895 edition of Marx's ''The Class Struggles in France'', Engels attempted to resolve the division between gradualist reformists and revolutionaries in the Marxist movement by declaring that he was in favour of short-term tactics of electoral politics that included gradualist and evolutionary socialist measures while maintaining his belief that revolutionary seizure of power by the proletariat should remain a goal. In spite of this attempt by Engels to merge gradualism and revolution, his effort only diluted the distinction of gradualism and revolution and had the effect of strengthening the position of the revisionists.{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=182}} Engels' statements in the French newspaper ''Le Figaro'', in which he stated that "revolution" and the "so-called socialist society" was not a fixed concept, but was a constantly changing social phenomenon and said that this made "us [socialists] all evolutionists", increased the public perception that Engels was gravitating towards evolutionary socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=186}} Engels also said that it would be "suicidal" to talk about a revolutionary seizure of power at a time when the historical circumstances favoured a parliamentary road to power that he predicted could bring "social democracy into power as early as 1898".{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=186}} Engels' stance of openly accepting gradualist, evolutionary and parliamentary tactics while claiming that the historical circumstances did not favour revolution caused confusion.{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=186}} Bernstein interpreted this as indicating that Engels was moving towards accepting parliamentary reformist and gradualist stances, but he ignored that Engels' stances were tactical as a response to the particular circumstances and that Engels was still committed to revolutionary socialism.{{sfn|Steger|1999|p=186}}

In 1897, after Bernstein delivered a lecture in Britain to the Fabian Society titled "On What Marx Really Taught", Bernstein wrote a letter to the orthodox Marxist Bebel in which he revealed that he felt conflicted with what he had said at the lecture as well as revealing his intentions regarding revision of Marxism:
{{quote|[A]s I was reading the lecture, the thought shot through my head that I was doing Marx an injustice, that it was not Marx I was presenting...I told myself secretly that this could not go on. It is idle to reconcile the irreconcilable. The vital thing is to be clear as to where Marx is still right and where he is not.{{sfn|Bernstein|2004|p=xix}}|sign=|source=}}

What Bernstein meant was that he believed that Marx was wrong in assuming that the capitalist economy would collapse as a result of its internal contradictions as by the mid-1890s there was little evidence of such internal contradictions causing this to capitalism.{{sfn|Bernstein|2004|p=xix}}

[[File:Jean-Jaurès01.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Jean Jaurès]]]]
The dispute over policies in favour of reform or revolution dominated discussions at the 1899 Hanover Party Conference of the Socialist Workers' Party of Germany (SAPD). This issue had become especially prominent with the [[Millerand Affair]] in France in which [[Alexandre Millerand]] of the [[Independent Socialists (France)|Independent Socialists]] joined the non-socialist government of France's liberal Prime Minister Waldeck-Rousseau without seeking support from his party's leadership.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=154}} Millerand's actions provoked outrage amongst revolutionary socialists within the Second International, including the anarchist left and [[Jules Guesde]]'s revolutionary Marxists.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=154}} In response to these disputes over reform or revolution, the 1900 Paris Congress of the Second International declared a resolution to the dispute, in which Guesde's demands were partially accepted in a resolution drafted by Kautsky that declared that overall socialists should not take part in a non-socialist government, but provided exceptions to this rule where necessary to provide the "protection of the achievements of the working class".{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=154}}

Another prominent figure who influenced social democracy was French revisionist Marxist and reformist socialist [[Jean Jaurès]]. During the 1904 Congress of the [[Second International]], Jaurès challenged orthodox Marxist [[August Bebel]], the mentor of Kautsky, over his promotion of monolithic socialist tactics. Jaurès claimed that no coherent socialist platform could be equally applicable to different countries and regions due to different political systems in them; noting that Bebel's homeland of Germany at the time was very authoritarian and had limited parliamentary democracy. He compared the limited political influence of socialism in government in Germany to the substantial influence that socialism had gained in France due to its stronger parliamentary democracy. He claimed that the example of the political differences between Germany and France demonstrated that monolithic socialist tactics were impossible, given the political differences of various countries.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=47}}

=== World Wars, revolutions, counterrevolutions and Great Depression (1914–1945) ===
As tensions between Europe's [[Great Powers]] escalated in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, Bernstein feared that Germany's [[arms race]] with other powers was threatening the possibility of a major war.{{sfn|Steger|1997|pp=217–218}} Bernstein's fears were realised with the outbreak of [[World War I]].{{sfn|Steger|1997|pp=217–218}}

[[File:Ramsay MacDonald ggbain 35734.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Ramsay MacDonald]], Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1929–1935), 1924]]
Immediately after the outbreak of World War I, Bernstein travelled from Germany to Britain to meet with [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party]] leader [[Ramsay MacDonald]]. Bernstein regarded the outbreak of the war with great dismay, but even though the two countries were at war with one another he honoured Bernstein at the meeting.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=167}} In spite of Bernstein's and other social democrats' attempts to secure the unity of the Second International, with national tensions increasing between the countries at war, the Second International collapsed in 1914.{{sfn|Steger|1997|pp=217–218}} Anti-war members of the SPD refused to support finances being given to the German government to support the war.{{sfn|Steger|1997|pp=217–218}} However, a nationalist-revisionist faction of SPD members led by [[Friedrich Ebert]], [[Gustav Noske]] and [[Philipp Scheidemann]] supported the war, arguing that Germany had the "right to its territorial defense" from the "destruction of Tsarist despotism".{{sfn|Steger|1997|pp=218–219}} The SPD's decision to support the war, including Bernstein's decision to support it, was heavily influenced by the fact that the German government lied to the German people, as it claimed that the only reason Germany had declared war on Russia was because Russia was preparing to invade [[East Prussia]], when in fact this was not the case.{{sfn|Steger|1997|p=219}} Jaurès opposed France's intervention in the war and took a [[Pacifism|pacifist]] stance, but was soon assassinated in 1914.{{sfn|Steger|1997|pp=218–219}}

Bernstein soon resented the war and by October 1914 was convinced of the German government's war guilt and contacted the orthodox Marxists of the SPD to unite to push the SPD to take an anti-war stance.{{sfn|Steger|1997|pp=218–219}} Kautsky attempted to put aside his differences with Bernstein and join forces in opposing the war and Kautsky praised him for becoming a firm anti-war proponent, saying that although Bernstein had previously supported "civic" and "liberal" forms of nationalism, his committed anti-war position made him the "standard-bearer of the internationalist idea of social democracy".{{sfn|Steger|1997}} The nationalist position by the SPD leadership under Ebert refused to rescind.{{sfn|Steger|1997}}

In Britain, the British Labour Party became divided on the war. Labour Party leader Ramsay MacDonald was one of a handful of [[Parliament of the United Kingdom|British MPs]] who had denounced Britain's declaration of war on Germany. MacDonald was denounced by the pro-war press on accusations that he was "pro-German" and a pacifist, both charges that he denied.{{sfn|Tucker|Roberts|p=1158}} In response to pro-war sentiments in the Labour Party, MacDonald resigned from being its leader and associated himself with the [[Independent Labour Party]]. [[Arthur Henderson]] became the new leader of the Labour Party and served as a cabinet minister in Prime Minister Asquith's war government. After the [[February Revolution]] of 1917 in Russia (not to be confused with the [[October Revolution]]) in which the Tsarist regime in Russia was overthrown, MacDonald visited the [[Russian Provisional Government]] in June 1917, seeking to persuade Russia to oppose the war and seek peace. His efforts to unite the Russian Provisional Government against the war failed after Russia fell back into political violence resulting in the October Revolution in which the Bolsheviks led [[Vladimir Lenin]]'s rise to power.{{sfn|Morgan|1987|pp=69–70}} Though MacDonald critically responded to the Bolsheviks' political violence and rise to power by warning of "the danger of anarchy in Russia", he gave political support to the Bolshevik regime until the end of the war because he then thought that a democratic internationalism could be revived.{{sfn|Morgan|1987|p=71}} The British Labour Party's trade union affiliated membership soared during World War I. With the assistance of [[Sidney Webb]], Henderson designed a new [[Labour Party Constitution|constitution for the British Labour Party]], in which it adopted a strongly [[Left-wing politics|left-wing]] platform in 1918 to ensure that it would not lose support to the new [[Communist Party of Great Britain|Communist Party]], exemplified by [[Clause IV]] of the constitution.{{sfn|Rubinstein|2006|pp=46–47}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00015, Friedrich Ebert.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Friedrich Ebert]], President of Germany (1919–1925)]]
The overthrow of the Tsarist regime in Russia in February 1917 impacted politics in Germany, as it ended the legitimation used by Ebert and other pro-war SPD members that Germany was in the war against a reactionary Russian government. With the overthrow of the Tsar and revolutionary socialist agitation increased in Russia, such events influenced socialists in Germany. With rising bread shortages in Germany amid war rationing, mass strikes occurred beginning in April 1917 with 300,000 strikers taking part in a strike in Berlin. The strikers demanded bread, freedom, peace and the formation of [[workers' council]]s as was being done in Russia. Amidst the German public's uproar, the SPD alongside the [[Progressive People's Party (Germany)|Progressives]] and the [[Centre Party (Germany)|Catholic]] labour movement in the [[Reichstag (German Empire)|Reichstag]] put forward the "Peace Resolution" on 19 July 1917 that called for a compromise peace to end the war, which was passed by a majority of members of the Reichstag. The German High Command opposed the Peace Resolution, but it did seek to end the war with Russia and presented the [[Treaty of Brest-Litovsk]] to the Bolshevik regime in 1918 that agreed to the terms and the Reichstag passed the treaty, which included the support of the SPD, the Progressives and the Catholic political movement.{{sfn|Chickering|p=155}}

By late 1918, the war situation for Germany had become hopeless and [[Kaiser Wilhelm II]] was pressured to make peace. Wilhelm II appointed a new cabinet that included SPD members. At the same time, the Imperial Naval Command was determined to make a heroic last stand against the British [[Royal Navy]] and on 24 October 1918 it issued orders for the German Navy to depart to confront while the sailors refused, resulting in the [[Kiel Mutiny]]. The Kiel Mutiny resulted in the [[German Revolution of 1918–1919]]. Faced with military failure and revolution the Chancellor, [[Prince Maximilian of Baden]] resigned, giving SPD leader Ebert the position of Chancellor, Wihelm II abdicated the German throne immediately afterwards and the German High Command officials [[Paul von Hindenburg]] and [[Erich Ludendorff]] resigned whilst refusing to end the war to save face, leaving the Ebert government and the SPD-majority Reichstag to be forced to make the inevitable peace with the Allies and take the blame for having lost the war. With the abdication of Wilhelm II, Ebert declared Germany to be a republic and signed the armistice that ended World War I on 11 November 1918.

The new social democratic government in Germany faced political violence in Berlin by a movement of [[Communism|communist]] revolutionaries known as the [[Spartacist League]] who sought to repeat the feat of Lenin and the Bolsheviks in Russia by overthrowing the German government.{{sfn|Childs|2000|p=2}} Tensions between the governing "Majority" Social Democrats (led by Ebert) versus the strongly left-wing elements of the Independent Social Democratic Party (USPD) and communists over Ebert's refusal to immediately reform the German Army, resulted in the "January rising" by the newly formed [[Communist Party of Germany]] (KPD) and the USPD, resulting in communists mobilizing a large workers' demonstration. The SPD responded by holding a counter-demonstration that was effective in demonstrating support for the government, and the USPD soon withdrew its support for the rising.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=145}} However, the communists continued to revolt and between 12 to 28 January 1919 communist forces had seized control of several government buildings in Berlin. Ebert responded by requesting that Defense Minister [[Gustav Noske]] take charge of loyal soldiers to fight the communists and secure the government.{{sfn|Childs|2000|p=2}} Ebert was furious with the communists' intransigence and said that he wished "to teach the radicals a lesson they would never forget". Noske was able to rally groups of mostly reactionary ex soldiers, known as the ''[[Freikorps]]'', who were eager to fight the communists. The situation soon went completely out of control when the recruited ''Freikorps'' went on a violent rampage against workers and murdered the communist leaders [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]]. The atrocities by the government-recruited ''Freikorps'' against the communist revolutionaries badly tarnished the reputation of the SPD and strengthened the confidence of reactionary forces. In spite of this, the SPD was able to win the largest number of seats in the parliamentary election held on 19 January 1919 and Ebert was elected [[President of Germany]], but the USPD in response to the atrocities committed by the government-recruited ''Freikorps'', refused to support the SPD government.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=145}}

Due to the unrest in Berlin, the drafting of the constitution of the new German republic was undertaken in the city of [[Weimar]] and the following political era is referred to as the [[Weimar Republic]]. Upon founding the new government, President Ebert cooperated with liberal members of his coalition government to create the constitution and sought to begin a program of [[nationalization]] of some parts of the economy. Political unrest and violence continued and the government's continued reliance on the help of the ''Freikorps'' counterrevolutionaries to fight the communist revolutionaries continued to alienate potential left-wing support for the SPD. The SPD coalition government's acceptance of the harsh peace conditions of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in June 1919, infuriated the right, including the ''Freikorps'' that had previously been willing to cooperate with the government to fight the communists. In the German parliamentary election of June 1919, the SPD share of the vote declined significantly. In March 1920, a group of right-wing [[Militarism|militarists]] led by [[Wolfgang Kapp]] and former German military chief-of-staff Erich Ludendorff initiated a briefly successful [[putsch]] against the German government in what became known as the [[Kapp Putsch]], but the putsch ultimately failed and the government was restored.{{sfn|Berman|1998|p=146}}

At a global level, after World War I several attempts were made to re-found the Second International that collapsed amidst national divisions in the war. The [[Vienna International]] formed in 1921 attempted to end the rift between reformist socialists, including social democrats; and revolutionary socialists, including communists, particularly the [[Mensheviks]].{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=509}} However, a crisis soon erupted that involved the new country of Georgia led by a social democratic government led by President [[Noe Zhordania]] that had declared itself independent from Russia in 1918 whose government had been endorsed by multiple social democratic parties. At founding meeting of the Vienna International, the discussions were interrupted by the arrival of a telegram from Zhordania who said that Georgia was being invaded by Bolshevik Russia. Delegates attending the International's founding meeting were stunned, particularly the Bolshevik representative from Russia, [[Mecheslav Bronsky]], who refused to believe this and left the meeting to seek confirmation of this, but upon confirmation Bronsky did not return to the meeting.{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=425}} The overall response from the Vienna International was divided, the Mensheviks demanded that the International immediately condemn Russia's aggression against Georgia, but the majority as represented by German delegate Alfred Henke sought to exercise caution and said that the delegates should wait for confirmation.{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=509}} Russia's invasion of Georgia completely violated the non-aggression treaty signed between Lenin and Zhordania, as well as violating Georgia's sovereignty by annexing Georgia directly into the [[Russian Soviet Federated Socialist Republic]]. Tensions between Bolsheviks and social democrats worsened with the [[Kronstadt rebellion]].{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=425}} This was caused by unrest among leftists against the Bolshevik government in Russia: Russian social democrats distributed leaflets calling for a general strike against the Bolshevik regime and the Bolsheviks responded by forcefully repressing the rebels.{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=434}}

Relations between the social democratic movement and Bolshevik Russia descended into complete antagonism in response to the [[Russian famine of 1921]] and the Bolsheviks' violent repression of opposition to their government. Multiple social democratic parties were disgusted with Russia's Bolshevik regime, particularly Germany's SPD and the Netherlands' [[Social Democratic Workers' Party (Netherlands)|Social Democratic Workers' Party]] (SDAP) that denounced the Bolsheviks for defiling socialism and declared that the Bolsheviks had "driven out the best of our comrades, thrown them into prison and put them to death".{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=441}}

In May 1923, social democrats united to found their own international, the [[Labour and Socialist International]] (LSI), founded in [[Hamburg]], Germany. The LSI declared that all its affiliated political parties would retain autonomy to make their own decisions regarding internal affairs of their countries, but that international affairs would be addressed by the LSI.{{sfn|Naarden|2002|p=509}} The LSI addressed the issue of the rise of [[fascism]] by declaring the LSI to be [[Anti-fascism|anti-fascist]].{{sfn|Ceplair|1987|p=78}} In response to the outbreak of the [[Spanish Civil War]] in 1936 between the democratically elected [[Republican faction (Spanish Civil War)|Republican]] government versus the authoritarian right-wing [[Nationalist faction (Spanish Civil War)|Nationalists]] led by [[Francisco Franco]] with the support of [[Kingdom of Italy|Fascist Italy]] and [[Nazi Germany]], the Executive Committee of the LSI declared not only its support for the [[Second Spanish Republic|Spanish Republic]] but also that it supported the Spanish government having the right to purchase arms to fight Franco's Nationalist forces. LSI-affiliated parties, including the British Labour Party, declared their support for the Spanish Republic.{{sfn|Alpert|p=67}} However, the LSI was criticised on the left for failing to put its anti-fascist rhetoric into action.{{sfn|Ceplair|1987|p=78}}

[[File:Hjalmar branting stor bild.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Hjalmar Branting]], Prime Minister of Sweden (1921–1923, 1924–1925), 1920]]
The stock market crash of 1929 that began an economic crisis in the United States that globally spread and became the [[Great Depression]] profoundly affected economic policy-making.{{sfn|Notermans|2000|p=102}} The collapse of the gold standard and the emergence of mass unemployment resulted in multiple governments recognising the need for state macroeconomic intervention to reduce unemployment as well as economic intervention to stabilise prices, a proto-[[Keynesianism]] that [[John Maynard Keynes]] himself would soon publicly endorse.{{sfn|Notermans|2000|pp=102, 110}} Multiple social democratic parties declared the need for substantial investment in economic infrastructure projects to respond to unemployment, and creating social control over money flow. Furthermore, social democratic parties declared that the Great Depression demonstrated the need for substantial macroeconomic planning while their pro-property rights opponents staunchly opposed this.{{sfn|Notermans|2000|p=111}} However, attempts by social democratic governments to achieve this were unsuccessful due to the ensuing political instability in their countries from the depression, the British Labour Party became internally split over the policies while Germany's SPD government did not have the time to implement such policies as Germany's politics turned to violent civil unrest in which the Nazis rose to power in 1933 and dismantled parliamentary democracy.{{sfn|Notermans|2000|p=102}}

A major development for social democracy was the victories of several social democratic parties in [[Scandinavia]], particularly the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] (SAP) in the 1920 Swedish election.{{sfn|Sejersted|2011|p=180}} The SAP was elected to a [[minority government]]. It created a Socialisation Committee that declared support for a [[mixed economy]] that combined the best of private initiative with social ownership or control, supporting a substantial socialisation "of all necessary natural resources, industrial enterprises, credit institutions, transportation and communication routes" that would be gradually transferred to the state.{{sfn|Macfarlane|1996|p=44}} It permitted private ownership outside of these areas.{{sfn|Macfarlane|1996|p=44}}

[[File:Gandhi at Darwen with women.jpg|thumb|[[Mohandas Gandhi]], here meeting with women textile workers in Britain, was a leadership figure of India's anti-colonial and social democratic [[Indian National Congress]]]]
In 1922, Ramsay MacDonald returned to the leadership of the Labour Party from the Independent Labour Party. In the 1924 British election, the Labour Party won a plurality of seats and was elected as a minority government, but required assistance from the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] to achieve a majority in parliament. Opponents of the Labour Party accused the party of communist sympathies. Prime Minister MacDonald responded to these allegations by stressing the party's commitment to reformist gradualism and openly opposing the radical wing in the party.{{sfn|Morgan|2006|pp=43–44}} MacDonald emphasized that the Labour minority government's first and foremost commitment was to uphold democratic responsible government over all other policies. MacDonald emphasized this because he knew that any attempt to pass major socialist legislation in a minority government status would endanger the new government, because it would be opposed and blocked by the [[Conservative Party (UK)|Conservatives]] and the Liberals who together held a majority of seats. The Labour Party had risen to power in the aftermath of Britain's severe recession of 1921–1922: with the economy beginning to recover, British trade unions demanded that their wages be restored from the cuts they took in the recession. The trade unions soon became deeply dissatisfied with the MacDonald government and labour unrest and threat of strikes arose in transportation sector, including docks and railways. MacDonald viewed the situation as a crisis, consulting the unions in advance to warn them that his government would have to use strikebreakers if the situation continued. The anticipated clash between the government and the unions was averted, but the situation alienated the unions from the MacDonald government. MacDonald's most controversial action was having Britain recognize the government of the Soviet Union in February 1924. The British Conservative press, including the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', used this to promote a [[red scare]] by claiming that the Labour government's recognition of the Soviet Union proved that Labour held pro-Bolshevik sympathies.{{sfn|Jeffreys|1999|p=29}}

The Labour Party lost the 1924 election and a Conservative government was elected. Though MacDonald faced multiple challenges to his leadership of the party, the party stabilized by 1927 as a capable opposition to the Conservative government. MacDonald released a new political programme for the party titled ''Labour and the Nation'' (1928). The Labour Party returned to government in 1929, but soon faced the economic catastrophe of the stock market crash of 1929.{{sfn|Jeffreys|1999|p=29}}

[[File:Rudolf Hilferding and Gattin, cropped.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] policymaker [[Rudolf Hilferding]], a major figure in the [[Sopade]]]]
In the 1920s, SPD policymaker and Marxist [[Rudolf Hilferding]] proposed substantial policy changes in the SPD as well as influencing social democratic and socialist theory. Hilferding was an influential Marxian socialist both inside the social democratic movement and outside it, such as his pamphlet titled ''Imperialism'' which influenced Lenin's own conception of imperialism in the 1910s. Prior to the 1920s Hilferding declared that capitalism had evolved beyond what had been ''[[laissez-faire]]'' capitalism into what he called "organized capitalism". Organized capitalism was based upon [[Trust (monopoly)|trusts]] and [[cartel]]s controlled by financial institutions that could no longer make money within their countries' national boundaries and thus needed to export to survive, resulting in support for imperialism.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=56}} Hilferding described that while early capitalism promoted itself as peaceful and based on free trade, the era of organized capitalism was aggressive and said that "in the place of humanity there came the idea of the strength and power of the state". He said that this had the consequence of creating effective collectivization within capitalism and had prepared the way for socialism.{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=57}}

Originally, Hilferding's vision of a socialism replacing organized capitalism was highly Kautskyan in assuming an either/or perspective and expecting a catastrophic clash between organized capitalism versus socialism. However, by the 1920s Hilferding became an adherent to promoting a gradualist evolution of capitalism into socialism. He then praised organized capitalism for being a step towards socialism, saying at the SPD congress in 1927 that "organized capitalism" is nothing less than "the replacement of the capitalist principle of free competition by the socialist principle of planned production". He went on to say that "the problem is posed to our generation: with the help of the state, with the help of conscious social direction, to transform the economy organized and led by capitalists into an economy directed by the democratic state".{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=57}}

[[File:Myrdal 1934.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Alva Myrdal]], a prominent figure in the [[Swedish Social Democratic Party]] in the 1930s and a pioneer in the development of the social welfare state in Sweden]]
In the 1930s, the SPD began to transition away from revisionist Marxism towards liberal socialism beginning in the 1930s. After the party was banned by the Nazis in 1933, the SPD acted in exile through [[Sopade]].{{sfn|Edinger|1956|p=215}} In 1934, the Sopade began to publish material that indicated that the SPD was turning towards liberal socialism. Curt Geyer, who was a prominent proponent of liberal socialism within the Sopade, declared that Sopade represented the tradition of Weimar Republic social democracy, liberal democratic socialism and stated that the Sopade had held true to its mandate of traditional liberal principles combined with the political realism of socialism.{{sfn|Edinger|1956|pp=219–220}}

The only social democratic governments in Europe that remained by the early 1930s were in Scandinavia.{{sfn|Notermans|2000|p=102}} In the 1930s, several Swedish social democratic leadership figures, including former Swedish Prime Minister [[Rickard Sandler]]—the secretary and chairman of the Socialization Committee—and Nils Karleby, rejected earlier SAP socialization policies pursued in the 1920s for being too extreme.{{sfn|Macfarlane|1996|p=44}} Karleby and Sandler developed a new conception of social democracy, the [[Nordic model]], which called for gradual socialization and redistribution of purchasing power, provision of educational opportunity and support of property rights. The Nordic model would permit private enterprise on the condition that it adheres to the principle that the resources it disposes are in reality public means and would create of a broad category of [[Social rights|social welfare rights]].{{sfn|Macfarlane|1996|pp=44–45}} The new SAP government of 1932 replaced the previous government's universal commitment to a [[balanced budget]] with a Keynesian-like commitment, which in turn was replaced with a balanced budget within a [[business cycle]]. Whereas the 1921–1923 SAP governments had run large deficits, after a strong increase in state expenditure in 1933 the new SAP government reduced Sweden's budget deficit. The government had planned to eliminate Sweden's budget deficit in seven years, but it took only three years to eliminate the deficit and Sweden had a budget surplus from 1936 to 1938. However, this policy was criticized because—although the budget deficit had been eliminated—major unemployment still remained a problem in Sweden.{{sfn|Notermans|2000|p=121}}

[[File:General Lázaro Cárdenas del Río.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Lázaro Cárdenas]], President of Mexico (1934–1940)]]
In the [[Americas]] from the 1920s to 1930s, social democracy was rising as a major political force. In [[Mexico]], several social democratic governments and presidents were elected from the 1920s to the 1930s. The most important Mexican social democratic government of this time was that led by President [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] and the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party|Party of the Mexican Revolution]] whose government initiated agrarian reform that broke up vast aristocratic estates and redistributed property to peasants. Cárdenas was deeply committed to social democracy, but was criticized by his left-wing opponents for being pro-capitalist due to his personal association with a wealthy family and for being corrupt due to his government's exemption from agrarian reform of the estate held by former Mexican President [[Alvaro Obregón]]. Political violence in Mexico had become serious in the 1920s with the [[Cristero War]] in which right-wing reactionary clericals fought against the left-wing government that was attempting to institute secularization of Mexico. Furthermore, Cardenas' government openly supported Spain's Republican government while opposing [[Francisco Franco]]'s Nationalists during the [[Spanish Civil War]]. During the Spanish Civil War, Cárdenas staunchly asserted that Mexico was progressive and socialist, working with socialists of various types—including communists—and accepting refugees from Spain, as well as accepting communist dissident [[Leon Trotsky]] as a refugee after [[Joseph Stalin]] expelled Trotsky and sought to have him killed. Cárdenas strengthened the rights of [[Labor unions in Mexico|Mexico's labour movement]], [[Pemex|nationalized]] foreign oil companies and controversially supported peasants in their struggle against landlords by allowing them to form militias to fight the private armies of landlords in the country. Cárdenas' actions deeply aggravated right-wing reactionaries and there was fear that Mexico would succumb to civil war. Cardenas stepped down as Mexican President and supported a compromise presidential candidate who held support from business interests in order to avoid further antagonizing the right-wing.{{sfn|Hart|1986|p=13}}{{clear}}

After World War II, a new international organization to represent social democracy and democratic socialism, the [[Socialist International]] in 1951. In the founding [[Frankfurt Declaration]], the Socialist International denounced both capitalism and [[Bolshevik]] communism—criticizing the latter in articles 7, 8, 9 and 10—saying: {{quote|{{ordered list|start=7|Meanwhile, as Socialism advances throughout the world, new forces have arisen to threaten the movement towards freedom and social justice.

The rise of Keynesianism in the [[Western world]] during the [[Cold War]] influenced the development of social democracy.{{sfn|Adams|1993|p=108}} The attitude of social democrats towards capitalism changed as a result of the rise of Keynesianism.{{sfn|Merkel|Petring|Henkes|Egle|2008|p=10}} Capitalism was acceptable to social democrats only if capitalism's typical crises could be prevented and if mass unemployment could be averted: Keynesianism was believed to be able to provide this.{{sfn|Merkel|Petring|Henkes|Egle|2008|p=10}} Social democrats came to accept the market for reasons of efficiency and endorsed Keynesianism as that was expected to reconcile democracy and capitalism.{{sfn|Merkel|Petring|Henkes|Egle|2008|p=10}}

[[File:Clement Attlee.png|thumb|left|upright|[[Clement Attlee|Lord Attlee]], Prime Minister of the United Kingdom (1945–1951)]]
After the [[United Kingdom general election, 1945|1945 British election]], a Labour government was formed by [[Clement Attlee]] (later known as Earl Attlee). Attlee immediately began a program of major nationalizations of the economy.{{sfn|Matthijs|2011|pp=65–67}} From 1945 to 1951, the Labour government nationalized the [[Bank of England]], [[British European Airways|civil aviation]], [[Cable &amp; Wireless plc|cable and wireless]], [[National Coal Board|coal]], [[British Transport Commission|transport]], [[British Electricity Authority|electricity]], [[Gas board|gas]] and [[Iron and Steel Corporation of Great Britain|iron and steel]].{{sfn|Matthijs|2011|pp=65–67}} This policy of major nationalizations gained support from the [[Bevanism|left faction]] within the Labour Party that saw the nationalizations as achieving the transformation of Britain from a capitalist to socialist economy.{{sfn|Matthijs|2011|pp=65–67}} However, the Labour government's nationalizations were staunchly condemned by the opposition Conservative Party.{{sfn|Matthijs|2011|pp=65–67}} The Conservatives defended private enterprise and accused the Labour government of intending to create a Soviet-style [[Central planning|centrally planned]] socialist state.{{sfn|Matthijs|2011|pp=65–67}} However, accusation by the Conservatives of the nationalizations being inspired by Soviet-style central planning was not the case, as the Labour government's three [[Chancellor of the Exchequer|Chancellors of the Exchequer]], [[Hugh Dalton]], [[Stafford Cripps]] and [[Hugh Gaitskell]], all opposed Soviet-style central planning.{{sfn|Matthijs|2011|pp=65–67}} Initially there were strong direct controls by the state in the economy that had already been implemented by the British government during World War II, but after the war these controls gradually loosened under the Labour government and were eventually phased out and replaced by Keynesian demand management.{{sfn|Matthijs|2011|pp=65–67}} In spite of opposition by the Conservatives to the nationalizations, all of the nationalizations except for the nationalization of coal and iron soon became accepted in a [[Post-war consensus|national consensus]] on the economy that lasted until the [[Margaret Thatcher|Thatcher]] era when the national consensus turned towards support of privatization.{{sfn|Matthijs|2011|pp=65–67}} The Labour Party lost the [[United Kingdom general election, 1951|1951 election]] and a Conservative government was formed.

There were early major critics of the nationalization policy within the Labour Party in the 1950s. In ''[[The Future of Socialism]]'' (1956), British social democratic theorist [[Anthony Crosland]] argued that socialism should be about the reforming of capitalism from within.{{sfn|Lamb|Docherty|2006|p=14}} Crosland claimed that the traditional socialist programme of abolishing capitalism on the basis of capitalism inherently causing [[Immiseration thesis|immiseration]] had been rendered obsolete by the fact that the post-war Keynesian capitalism had led to the expansion of affluence for all, including full employment and a welfare state.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=76}} Crosland claimed that the rise of such an affluent society had resulted in class identity fading and as a consequence socialism in its traditional conception as then supported by the British Labour Party was no longer attracting support.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=76}} He claimed that the Labour Party was associated in the public's mind as having "a sectional, traditional, class appeal" that was reinforced by bickering over nationalization.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=76}} Crosland argued that in order for the Labour Party to become electable again it had to drop its commitment to nationalization and to stop equating nationalization with socialism.{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=76}} Instead of this, he claimed that a socialist programme should be about support of social welfare, redistribution of wealth and "the proper dividing line between the public and private spheres of responsibility".{{sfn|Ellis|2004|p=76}}

The SPD in [[West Germany]] in 1945 endorsed a similar policy on nationalizations to that of the British Labour government. SPD leader [[Kurt Schumacher]] declared that the SPD was in favour of nationalizations of key industrial sectors of the economy, such as banking and credit, insurance, mining, coal, iron, steel, metal-working and all other sectors that were identified as monopolistic or [[cartel]]ized.{{sfn|Notermans|2000|p=155}}

Upon becoming a sovereign state in 1947, India elected the social democratic [[Indian National Congress]] to government with its leader [[Jawaharlal Nehru]] becoming Indian Prime Minister. Nehru declared: "In Europe, we see many countries have advanced very far on the road to socialism. I am not referring to the communist countries but to those which may be called parliamentary, social democratic countries".{{sfn|Agrawal|Aggarwal|1989|p=85}} In power, Nehru's government emphasized state-guided national development of India and took inspiration from social democracy, though India's newly formed [[Planning Commission (India)|Planning Commission]] also took inspiration from post-1949 China's agricultural policies.{{sfn|Berger|2004|p=73}}

The new sovereign state of [[Israel]] elected the socialist [[Mapai]] party that sought the creation of a socialist economy based on cooperative ownership of the means of production via the ''[[kibbutz]]'' system while it rejected nationalization of the means of production.{{sfn|Janowsky|1959|p=94}} The ''kibbutz'' are [[producer cooperative]]s that with government assistance have flourished in Israel.{{sfn|Busky|2000|p=11}}

In 1959, the SPD instituted a major policy review with the [[Godesberg Program]].{{sfn|Orlow|2000|p=108}} The Godesberg Program eliminated the party's remaining Marxist-aligned policies and the SPD became based upon ''freiheitlicher Sozialismus'' (liberal socialism).{{sfn|Orlow|2000|p=108}} With the adoption of the Godsberg Program, the SPD renounced Marxist determinism and classism and replaced it with an ethical socialism based on humanism and emphasized that the party was democratic, pragmatic and reformist.{{sfn|Orlow|2000|p=190}} The most controversial decision of the Godesberg Program was its declaration saying: "Private ownership of the means of production can claim protection by society as long as it does not hinder the establishment of social justice".{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=108}} This policy meant the endorsement of Keynesian economic management, social welfare and a degree of economic planning, as well as an abandonment of the classical conception of socialism as involving the replacement of capitalist economic system.{{sfn|Adams|2001|p=108}} It declared that the SPD "no longer considered nationalization the major principle of a socialist economy but only one of several (and then only the last) means of controlling economic concentration of power of key industries", while also committing the SPD to an economic stance to promote "as much competition as possible, as much planning as necessary".{{sfn|Berman|2006|p=190}} This decision to abandon this traditional policy angered many in the SPD who had supported it.{{sfn|Orlow|2000|p=190}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv B 145 Bild-F057884-0009, Willy Brandt.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Willy Brandt]], Chancellor of West Germany (1969–1974)]]
With these changes, the SPD enacted the two major pillars of what would become the modern social democratic program: making the party a people's party rather than a party solely representing the working class and abandoning remaining Marxist policies aimed at destroying capitalism and replacing them with policies aimed at reforming capitalism.{{sfn|Berman|2006|p=190}} The Godesberg Program divorced its conception of socialism from Marxism, declaring that democratic socialism in Europe was "rooted in Christian ethics, humanism, and classical philosophy".{{sfn|Berman|2006|p=190}} The Godesberg Program has been seen as involving the final prevailing of the reformist agenda of Bernstein over the orthodox Marxist agenda of Kautsky.{{sfn|Berman|2006|p=190}}

The Godesberg Program was a major revision of the SPD's policies and gained attention from beyond Germany.{{sfn|Orlow|2000|p=190}} At the time of its adoption, in neighbouring France the stance of the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO) was divided on the Godesberg Program while the [[Unified Socialist Party (France)|Autonomous Socialist Party]] (PSA) denounced the Godesberg Program as "a renunciation of Socialism" and opportunistic reaction to the SPD's electoral defeats.{{sfn|Orlow|2000|p=190}}

=== Response to neoliberalism (1979–1990s) ===

In 1989, the [[Socialist International]] adopted its present Declaration of Principles. The Declaration of Principles addressed issues concerning the "internationalization of the economy". The Declaration of Principles defined its interpretation of the nature of socialism. It stated that socialist values and vision include "a peaceful and democratic world society combining freedom, justice and solidarity". It defined the rights and freedoms it supported, stating: "Socialists protect the inalienable right to life and to physical safety, to freedom of belief and free expression of opinion, to freedom of association and to protection from torture and degradation. Socialists are committed to achieve freedom from hunger and want, genuine social security, and the right to work". However, it also clarified that it did not promote any fixed and permanent definition for socialism, stating: "Socialists do not claim to possess the blueprint for some final and fixed society which cannot be changed, reformed or further developed. In a movement committed to democratic self-determination there will always be room for creativity since each people and every generation must set its own goals".&lt;ref&gt;''Declaration of Principles''.

The 1989 Socialist International congress was politically significant in that members of [[Communist Party of the Soviet Union]] during the reformist leadership of [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] attended the congress. The Socialist International's new Declaration of Principles abandoned previous statements made in the Frankfurt Declaration of 1951 against Soviet-style communism. After the congress, the Soviet state newspaper ''[[Pravda]]'' noted that thanks to dialogue between the Soviet Communist Party and the SI since 1979 that "the positions of the CPSU and the Socialist International on nuclear disarmament issues today virtually coincide".{{sfn|Van Oudenaren|1991|p=144}}

The [[Revolutions of 1989|collapse of the Marxist–Leninist regimes]] in Eastern Europe after the end of the Cold War and the creation of multiparty democracy in many many of those countries resulted in the creation of multiple social democratic parties. Though many of these parties did not achieve initial electoral success, they became a significant part of the political landscape of Eastern Europe. In Western Europe, the prominent [[Italian Communist Party]] transformed itself into the post-communist [[Democratic Party of the Left]] in 1991.{{sfn|Lamb|Docherty|2006|p=82}}

=== Third Way (1990s–2010s) ===
In the 1990s, [[Third Way]] politics developed and many social democrats became adherents of it. The social democratic variant of the Third Way has been advocated by its proponents as an alternative to both capitalism and what it regards as the traditional forms of socialism—including [[Socialism (Marxism)|Marxist socialism]] and [[state socialism]]—which Third Way social democrats reject. It officially advocates [[ethical socialism]], [[reformism]] and [[gradualism]], which includes advocating a humanized version of capitalism, a [[mixed economy]], political pluralism and [[liberal democracy]].&lt;ref name="Arora922"&gt;N.D. Arora. ''Political Science for Civil Services Main Examination''. Tata McGraw-Hill Education, 2010. 9.22.&lt;/ref&gt; Left-wing opponents of Third Way social democracy claim that it is not a form of socialism and claim that it represents social democrats who responded to the [[New Right]] by accepting [[capitalism]].{{sfn|Romano|2006|p=5}} The Third Way has been strongly criticized within the social democratic movement.{{sfn|Cammack|2004|p=155}} Supporters of Third Way ideals argue that they merely represent a necessary or pragmatic adaptation of social democracy to the realities of the modern world, noting that traditional social democracy thrived during the prevailing international climate of the post-war [[Bretton Woods system|Bretton Woods consensus]], which collapsed in the 1970s.

When he was a British Labour Party MP, Third Way supporter and former British Prime Minister [[Tony Blair]] wrote in a Fabian pamphlet in 1994 about the existence of two prominent variants of socialism: one is based on a Marxist economic determinist and collectivist tradition that he rejected and the other is an "ethical socialism" that he supported which was based on values of "social justice, the equal worth of each citizen, equality of opportunity, community".{{sfn|Tansey|Jackson|2008|p=97}}

[[File:Anthony Giddens at the Progressive Governance Converence, Budapest, Hungary, 2004 October.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Anthony Giddens|Lord Giddens]], a prominent proponent of Third Way politics]]
Prominent Third Way proponent [[Anthony Giddens|Anthony Giddens, Baron Giddens]] views conventional socialism as essentially having become obsolete. However, Giddens claims that a viable form of socialism was advocated by [[Anthony Crosland]] in his major work ''The Future of Socialism'' (1956).{{sfn|Giddens|1998|p=67}} He has complimented Crosland as well as [[Thomas Humphrey Marshall]] for promoting a viable socialism.{{sfn|Giddens|1998|p=73}} Giddens views what he considers the conventional form of socialism that defines socialism as a theory of economic management—state socialism—as no longer viable.{{sfn|Cammack|2004|p=152}} He rejects what he considers top-down socialism as well as rejecting neoliberalism&lt;ref name="Arora922"/&gt; and criticizes conventional socialism for its common advocacy that socialization of production as achieved by [[central planning]] can overcome the irrationalities of capitalism. Giddens claims that this claim "can no longer be defended". He says that with the collapse of legitimacy of centrally planned socialization of production, "[w]ith its dissolution, the radical hopes for by socialism are as dead as the Old Conservatism that opposed them". Giddens says that although there have been proponents of [[market socialism]] who have rejected such central planned socialism as well as being resistant to capitalism, "[t]here are good reasons, in my view, to argue that market socialism isn't a realistic possibility". Giddens makes clear that the Third Way, as he envisions it, is not market socialist, arguing that "[t]here is no Third Way of this sort, and with this realization the history of socialism as the avant-garde of political theory comes to a close".{{sfn|Giddens|1998|p=67}} Giddens contends that Third Way is connected to the legacy of reformist revisionist socialism, saying: "Third way politics stands in the traditions of social democratic revisionism that stretch back to Eduard Bernstein and Karl Kautsky".{{sfn|Giddens|2003|p=2}}

[[File:Romano Prodi in Nova Gorica (2c).jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Romano Prodi]], two-time [[Prime Minister of Italy]], former [[President of the European Commission]] and founding father of the [[Democratic Party (Italy)|Democratic Party]]]]
Giddens commends Crosland's ''A Future of Socialism'' for recognizing that socialism cannot be defined merely in terms of a rejection of capitalism because if capitalism did end and was replaced with socialism, then socialism would have no purpose with the absence of capitalism.{{sfn|Giddens|1998|p=71}} From Crosland's analysis, Giddens proposes a description of socialism: {{quote|The only common characteristic of socialist doctrines is their ethical content. Socialism is the pursuit of ideas of social cooperation, universal welfare, and equality—ideas brought together by a condemnation of the evils and injustices of capitalism. It is based on the critique of individualism and depends on a 'belief in group action and "participation", and collective responsibility for social welfare'.{{sfn|Giddens|1998|p=71}}}}

Paul Cammack has condemned the Third Way as conceived by Lord Giddens as being a complete attack upon the foundations of social democracy and socialism, in which Giddens has sought to replace them with capitalism. Cammack claims that Giddens devotes a lot of energy into criticizing conventional social democracy and conventional socialism—such as Giddens' claim that conventional socialism has "died" because Marx's vision of a new economy with wealth spread in an equitable way is not possible—while at the same time making no criticism of capitalism. As such, Cammack condemns Giddens and his Third Way for being anti-social-democratic, anti-socialist and pro-capitalist that Giddens disguises in rhetoric to make appealing within social democracy.{{sfn|Cammack|2004|p=155}}

British political theorist [[Robert Corfe]] who was in the past a social democratic proponent of a new socialism free of class-based prejudices, criticized both Marxist classists and Third Way proponents within the Labour Party.{{sfn|Corfe|2010|p=178}} Corfe has denounced the Third Way as developed by Giddens for "intellectual emptiness and ideological poverty".{{sfn|Corfe|2010|p=33}} Corfe has despondently noted and agreed with former long-term British Labour Party MP [[Alice Mahon]]'s statement in which she said "Labour is the party of bankers, not workers. The party has lost its soul, and what has replace it is harsh, American style politics". Corfe claims that the failure to develop a new socialism has resulted in what he considers the "death of socialism" that left social capitalism as only feasible alternative.{{sfn|Corfe|2010|pp=33, 178}}

[[File:Oskar Lafontaine, 2011-03-21.jpg|thumb|[[Oskar Lafontaine]], co-founder of Germany's political party [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]], had been chairman of the SPD, but resigned and quit the party out of opposition to the SPD's adoption of Third Way positions]]
Former SPD chairman [[Oskar Lafontaine]] condemned then-SPD leader and German Chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] for his Third Way policies, saying that the SPD under Schröder had adopted "a radical change of direction towards a policy of neoliberalism".{{sfn|Barrientos|Powell|2004|p=18}} After resigning from the SPD, Lafontaine co-founded [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] in 2007.{{sfn|Lafontaine|2009|p=7}} The Left was founded out of a merger of the [[Party of Democratic Socialism (Germany)|Party of Democratic Socialism]] (PDS) and [[Labour and Social Justice – The Electoral Alternative]] (WASG), a breakaway faction from the SPD. The Left has been controversial because as a direct successor to the PDS it is also a direct successor of former [[East Germany]]'s ruling Marxist–Leninist [[Socialist Unity Party of Germany|Socialist Unity Party]] (SED) that transformed into the PDS after the end of the Cold War. However, the PDS did not continue the SED's policies as the PDS adopted policies to appeal to democratic socialists, greens, feminists and pacifists.{{sfn|Hudson|2012|pp=1–2}} Lafontaine said in an interview that he supports the type of social democracy pursued by [[Willy Brandt]], but claims that the creation of The Left was necessary because "formerly socialist and social democratic parties" had effectively accepted [[neoliberalism]].{{sfn|Lafontaine|2009|p=7}} The Left grew in strength and in the 2009 German parliamentary election gained 11 percent of the vote while the SPD gained 23 percent of the vote.{{sfn|Hudson|2012|pp=1–2}}

Lafontaine has noted that the founding of The Left in Germany has resulted in emulation in other countries, with several Left parties being founded in Greece, Portugal, Netherlands and Syria.{{sfn|Lafontaine|2009|p=3}} Lafontaine claims that a ''[[de facto]]'' British Left movement exists, identifying the [[Green Party of England and Wales]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Caroline Lucas]] as holding similar values.{{sfn|Lafontaine|2009|p=4}}

Others have claimed that social democracy needs to move past the Third Way, such as Olaf Cramme and Patrick Diamond in their book ''After the Third Way: The Future of Social Democracy in Europe'' (2012).{{sfn|Gamble|2012|p=47}} Cramme and Diamond recognize that the Third Way arose as an attempt to break down the traditional dichotomy within social democracy between state intervention and markets in the economy, but they contend that the [[2007–2012 global economic crisis|global financial crisis of the late 2000s]] requires that social democracy must rethink its [[political economy]]. Cramme and Diamond note that belief in economic planning amongst socialists was strong in the early to mid-twentieth century, but declined with the rise of the neoliberal right that both attacked economic planning and associated the left with economic planning. They claim that this formed the foundation of the "Right's moral trap" in which the neoliberal right attacks on economic planning policies by the left, that provokes a defense of such planning by the left as being morally necessary and ends with the right then rebuking such policies as being inherently economically incompetent while presenting itself as the champion of economic competence.{{sfn|Gamble|2012|p=50}} Cramme and Diamond state that social democracy has five different strategies both to address the economic crisis in global markets at present that it could adopt in response: market conforming, market complimenting, market resisting, market substituting and market transforming.{{sfn|Gamble|2012|p=54}}

Cramme and Diamond identify market conforming as being equivalent to British Labour Party politician and former [[Chancellor of the Exchequer]] [[Philip Snowden]]'s desire for a very moderate socialist agenda based above all upon fiscal prudence, as Snowden insisted that socialism had to build upon fiscal prudence or else it would not be achieved.{{sfn|Gamble|2012|pp=54–55}}

=== Decline in Western Europe (2010s–present) ===
In the 2010s, the social democratic parties that had dominated some of the post-World War II political landscape in Western Europe were under pressure in some countries to the extent that a commentator in ''[[Foreign Affairs]]'' called it an "implosion of the centre-left".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/europe/2017-04-25/death-and-life-social-democracy|author=Pierpaolo Barbieri|title=The Death and Life of Social Democracy|journal=Foreign Affairs|date=25 April 2017|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first country that saw this development was Greece in the aftermath of the [[Great Recession]] and the ongoing [[Greek government-debt crisis]]. Support for the Greek social democrat party [[PASOK]] declined from 43.9% in the 2009 [[Hellenic parliament]] election to 4.68% in the January 2015 election. The decline subsequently proved to not be isolated to Greece as it spread to a number of countries in [[Western Europe]], a phenomenon many observers thus described as "[[Pasokification]]":
* The Netherlands: In the [[Dutch general election, 2017|2017 Dutch general election]] the social democratic party [[Labour Party (Netherlands)|PvdA]] received 5.7% of votes, down from 24.8% in the [[Dutch general election, 2012|2012 election]].
* Iceland: in the [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2016|2016 Icelandic parliamentary election]], the [[Social Democratic Alliance]] received 5.7% of votes, down from 29.8% in the [[Icelandic parliamentary election, 2013|2013 election]]. This is their lowest support in any election since the main predecessor of the alliance, the [[Social Democratic Party (Iceland)|Social Democratic Party]], first ran for election in 1916.
* France: in the first round of the [[French presidential election, 2017|2017 French presidential election]], the [[Socialist Party (France)|Socialist Party]] candidate [[Benoît Hamon]] received 6.4% of the votes, placing fifth, down from 28.6% in the 2012 when the party's candidate [[François Hollande]] was eventually elected president. In November 2016, Hollande's approval rating was 4%.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2016/11/02/mon-dieu-francois-hollandes-approval-rating-is-at-four-percent/|title=Mon Dieu, François Hollande's Approval Rating Is at 4 Percent|author=Emily Tamkin|publisher=Foreign Policy|date=2 November 2016|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Ireland: the Irish [[Labour Party (Ireland)|Labour Party]] received 6.6% of the vote in the [[Irish general election, 2016|2016 Irish general election]], their worst result since 1987 and down from 19.5% in the 2011 election.
* Luxembourg: the [[Luxembourg Socialist Workers' Party]] received 20.2% of the vote in the [[Luxembourg general election, 2013|2013 Luxembourg general election]], their lowest support since the 1931 general election.
* Germany: the [[Social Democratic Party of Germany]] dramatically fell from 34.2% of the vote in 2005 to 23.0% in 2009. This was the lowest support for SPD in post-World War II history. It was reduced even to 20.5% in the [[German federal election, 2017|2017 Bundestag election]]. 
* Spain: the [[Spanish general election, 2015|2015 Spanish general election]] resulted in the worst electoral results for the social democratic party [[Spanish Socialist Workers' Party]] since the re-establishment of democracy in 1977, at 22% of the vote.
However, in other countries such as Denmark and Portugal support for social democratic parties was relatively strong in polls as of 2017. Moreover, in some countries the decline of the social democratic parties was accompanied by a surge in the support for other centre-left or left-wing parties, such as [[Syriza]] in Greece, [[Unidos Podemos]] in Spain and the [[Left-Green Movement]] in Iceland.

Several explanations for the European decline have been proposed. Some commentators highlight that the social democrat support of national fragmentation and labour market [[deregulation]] had become less popular among potential voters. For instance, French political scientist [[Pierre Manent]] emphasised the need for social democrats to rehabilitate and reinvigorate the idea of nationhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eprints.lse.ac.uk/69974/|author=Tom Angier|title=What French philosophy can tell us about the EU, nationhood, and the decline of social democracy|date=8 February 2017|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the Norwegian [[Labour Party (Norway)|Labour Party]]'s loss in the 2017 election, commentators such as the editor of ''[[Avisenes Nyhetsbyrå]]'' highlighted that the party had ignored a strong surge in discontent with immigration among potential voters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nrk.no/ytring/en-venstreside-pa-villspor-1.13685623|title=En venstreside på villspor|author=Espen Goffeng|date=12 September 2017|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.namdalsavisa.no/meninger/2017/10/03/Ap-har-mistet-folket-15397758.ece|title=Ap har mistet folket|author=Håkon Arntsen|date=3 October 2017|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.siste.no/meninger/politikk/innenriks/ap-ble-for-utydelig/o/5-47-103273|title=Ap ble for utydelig|author=Kjell Werner|date=4 October 2017|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.dt.no/meninger/politikk-og-samfunn/innvandring/innvandring-og-fortielse/o/5-57-737974|title=Innvandring og fortielse|author=Johannes Norman Hoel|date=5 October 2017|accessdate=20 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Hanne Skartveit]] of [[Verdens Gang]] later claimed that social democrats have been struggling because the sustainability of the welfare state is challenged by immigration. Skarstein emphasised the contrast between social democrats' strong commitment for helping people on the international scene on one side, and their strong commitment in favour of welfare policies for the nation's own population on the other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.nrk.no/norge/_-splittelsen-gar-tvers-gjennom-ap-1.14204473 | title=– Splittelsen går tvers gjennom Ap| date=2018-09-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2017 article in ''[[The Political Quarterly]]'' explains the decline in Germany with electoral disillusionment with Third Way politics, or more specifically [[Gerhard Schröder]]'s embracement of the [[Hartz concept|Hartz plan]], which recommended welfare state retrenchment and labour market deregulation. The article claims that the SPD subsequently lost half of its former electoral coalition, namely blue-collar voters and socially disadvantaged groups, while efforts to gain access to centrist and middle-class voters failed to produce any compensating gains. Furthermore, the article concludes that the only possible remedy is for the SPD to make efforts to regain former voters by offering credible social welfare and redistributive policies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Crisis of German Social Democracy Revisited|journal = The Political Quarterly|volume = 88|issue = 2|pages = 230–240|author=Jörg Michael Dostal|date=19 December 2016|doi=10.1111/1467-923X.12316|url = https://www.ssoar.info/ssoar/handle/document/55601}}&lt;/ref&gt; A research article in ''[[Socio-Economic Review]]'' found that the longer-term electoral effects of the Hartz plan and [[Agenda 2010]] on relevant voter groups were limited, but that it had helped to entrench [[The Left (Germany)|The Left]] as a permanent political force to the left of SPD.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=https://academic.oup.com/ser/article-abstract/15/1/117/2890788|title='Modernize and Die'?

[[Spain]] is one of the countries in which the main social democratic party, the [[Spanish Socialist Party]], has been in government for a longer period of time than any other party since the [[Spanish transition to democracy|transition to democracy]] in 1977. However, it has also declined like the European social democratic parties, losing half of its electorate between 2010 and 2015 and gaining its worse ever result since the restoration of democracy. Despite this, the [[Spanish Socialist Party|Spanish Socialist party]] returned to power in June 2018, with [[Pedro Sánchez (politician)|Pedro Sánchez]] leading the party.

== Criticism ==
{{too few opinions|section|date=May 2015}}
From a purely socialist point of view, social democratic reform is a failure since it serves to devise new means to strengthen the capitalist system, which conflicts with the socialist goal of replacing capitalism with a socialist system.{{sfn|Clarke|1981|p=2}}

Socialist critics often criticize social democracy on the grounds that it fails to address the systemic issues inherent to capitalism, arguing that ameliorative social programs and interventionism generate issues and contradictions of their own, thus limiting the efficiency of the capitalist system. The American democratic socialist philosopher [[David Schweickart]] contrasts social democracy with [[democratic socialism]] by defining the former as an attempt to strengthen the welfare state and the latter as an alternative economic system to capitalism. According to Schweickart, the democratic socialist critique of social democracy is that capitalism can never be sufficiently "humanized" and that any attempt to suppress its economic contradictions will only cause them to emerge elsewhere. For example, attempts to reduce unemployment too much would result in inflation and too much job security would erode labour discipline.{{sfn|Schweickart|2007|ps=: "Social democrats supported and tried to strengthen the basic institutions of the welfare state—pensions for all, public health care, public education, unemployment insurance. They supported and tried to strengthen the labor movement. The latter, as socialists, argued that capitalism could never be sufficiently humanized and that trying to suppress the economic contradictions in one area would only see them emerge in a different guise elsewhere (e.g., if you push unemployment too low, you'll get inflation; if job security is too strong, labor discipline breaks down.)"}} In contrast to social democracy, democratic socialists advocate a post-capitalist economic system based on either market socialism combined with workers self-management or on some form of [[Decentralized planning (economics)|participatory-economic planning]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Schweickart|2007}}: "Virtually all [democratic] socialists have distanced themselves from the economic model long synonymous with socialism (i.e., the Soviet model of a nonmarket, centrally planned economy) [...] Some have endorsed the concept of market socialism, a postcapitalist economy that retains market competition but socializes the means of production and, in some versions, extends democracy to the workplace. Some hold out for a nonmarket, participatory economy. All democratic socialists agree on the need for a democratic alternative to capitalism."&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Marxism|Marxian]] socialists argue that social democratic welfare policies cannot resolve the fundamental structural issues of capitalism, such as [[Business cycle|cyclical fluctuations]], [[Exploitation of labour|exploitation]] and [[Marx's theory of alienation|alienation]]. Accordingly, social democratic programs intended to ameliorate living conditions in capitalism—such as unemployment benefits and taxation on profits—creates further contradictions by further limiting the efficiency of the capitalist system via reducing incentives for capitalists to invest in further production.{{sfn|Ticktin|1998|pp=60–61|ps=: "The Marxist answers that...it involves limiting the incentive system of the market through providing minimum wages, high levels of unemployment insurance, reducing the size of the [[reserve army of labour]], taxing profits, and taxing the wealthy. As a result, capitalists will have little incentive to invest and the workers will have little incentive to work. Capitalism works because, as Marx remarked, it is a system of economic force (coercion)."}} The welfare state only serves to legitimize and prolong the exploitative and contradiction-laden system of capitalism to society's detriment. Critics of contemporary social democracy, such as Jonas Hinnfors, argue that when social democracy abandoned Marxism it also abandoned socialism and has become a liberal capitalist movement,{{sfn|Hinnfors|2006|pp=117, 137–139}} effectively making social democrats similar to non-socialist parties like the U.S. [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic Party]].

[[Market socialism]] is also critical of social democratic welfare states. While one common goal of both concepts is to achieve greater social and economic equality, market socialism does so by changes in enterprise ownership and management, whereas social democracy attempts to do so by subsidies and taxes on privately owned enterprises to finance welfare programs. [[Franklin Delano Roosevelt III]] and David Belkin criticize social democracy for maintaining a [[Property income|property-owning capitalist class]] which has an active interest in reversing social democratic welfare policies and a disproportionate amount of power as a class to influence government policy.{{sfn|Weisskopf|1994|pp=314–315|ps=: "Social democracy achieves greater egalitarianism via ''ex post'' government taxes and subsidies, where market socialism does so via ''ex ante'' changes in patterns of enterprise ownership [...] the maintenance of property-owning capitalists under social democracy assures the presence of a disproportionately powerful class with a continuing interest in challenging social democratic government policies."}} The economists [[John Roemer]] and [[Pranab Bardhan]] point out that social democracy requires a strong labour movement to sustain its heavy redistribution through taxes and that it is idealistic to think such redistribution can be accomplished in other countries with weaker labour movements. They note that even in Scandinavian countries social democracy has been in decline as the labour movement weakened.{{sfn|Bardhan|Roemer|1992|p=104|ps=: "Since it [social democracy] permits a powerful capitalist class to exist (90 percent of productive assets are privately owned in Sweden), only a strong and unified labor movement can win the redistribution through taxes that is characteristic of social democracy. It is idealistic to believe that tax concessions of this magnitude can be effected simply through electoral democracy without an organized labor movement, when capitalists organize and finance influential political parties. Even in the Scandinavian countries, strong apex labor organizations have been difficult to sustain and social democracy is somewhat on the decline now."}}

[[Joseph Stalin]] was a vocal critic of reformist social democracy, later coining the term "[[social fascism]]" to describe social democracy in the 1930s because in this period social democracy embraced a similar corporatist economic model to the model supported by fascism. This view was adopted by the [[Communist International]].

There are critics{{Attribution needed|date=September 2015}} that claim that social democracy abandoned socialism in the 1930s by endorsing Keynesian [[welfare capitalism]].{{sfnm|1a1=Fitzpatrick|1y=2003|1pp=2–3|2a1=Wright|2y=1999|2p=91}} The democratic socialist political theorist [[Michael Harrington]] argues that social democracy historically supported Keynesianism as part of a "social democratic compromise" between capitalism and socialism. This compromise created welfare states and thus Harrington contends that although this compromise did not allow for the immediate creation of socialism, it "recognized noncapitalist, and even anticapitalist, principles of human need over and above the imperatives of profit".{{sfn|Harrington|2011|p=93}} More recently, social democrats in favour of the Third Way have been accused of having endorsed capitalism, including by anti-Third Way social democrats who have accused Third Way proponents such as [[Anthony Giddens|Lord Giddens]] of being anti-social democratic and anti-socialist in practice.{{sfn|Cammack|2004|p=155}}

'''Tavar Zawacki''' (born 1981) is an American [[abstract art]]ist based in Berlin, Germany.&lt;ref name="BIO"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tavarzawacki.com/bio/|title=Biography |publisher=tavarzawacki.com |accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; For twenty years (1996–2016) Tavar Zawacki created and signed all of his artworks with his [[street artist]] pseudonym, 'ABOVE'.&lt;ref name="p_155"&gt;&lt;!-- cite book --&gt;Tavar Zawacki, ''Metamorphosis''. Germany: Urban Spree Books, 2017 page155. {{ISBN|978-3-9819026-0-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 19, Tavar bought a one way flight from California to Paris, France, bringing with him a backpack full of art supplies, all the money in his bank account ($1,500 usd), and a 'rise above your fears' approach to starting his art career.&lt;ref name="BIO"/&gt; Starting in Paris in 2000, Tavar transitioned from painting traditional letter style [[graffiti]] of A-B-O-V-E, to his 'Above arrow' icon that represented his optimistic mentality to 'rise above fears, challenges, and anything holding you back from your goals.'&lt;ref name="BIO"/&gt; During a 20-year period the artworks of ABOVE could be seen in over 100 cities spanning 50 countries around the world.&lt;ref name="ReferenceD"&gt;*Above:Passport, October 2011. {{ISBN|978-1-937222-03-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In January 2017, Tavar Zawacki decided to step out of his self-imposed shadow of [[anonymity]], and start creating, and signing artworks with his real birth name -  allowing more freedom of creative exploration, as well as liberation from the arrow icon he has associated himself with.  Tavar Zawacki's painting styles with his large scale mural works, as well as his indoor fine art are characterized by the use of [[hard-edge painting]], [[color field]], [[geometric abstraction]], [[Op art]], and [[Trompe-l'oeil]] painting styles.&lt;ref name="p_155"/&gt; Tavar Zawacki has been showcasing his work in galleries and creative institutions around the world since 2005.&lt;ref name="p_155"/&gt;

== Career ==

=== Early career (1995–2003) ===

Tavar Zawacki was born in the foothills of Northern California in 1981 from two creative [[hippie]] parents who invented his name.&lt;ref name="BIO"/&gt; Tavar was encouraged by both parents at a very young age to express himself through art, and music. At the age of 13 years old, Tavar was introduced to skateboarding and graffiti. Tavar stated 'as a teenager I spent my time after school skateboarding, and painting graffiti on trains at the train yard. I was magnetized towards skateboarding, and graffiti because they were both D.I.Y. and independent ways of expressing myself.'&lt;ref name="BIO"/&gt; 
At age fifteen, Tavar started spray painting the traditional letter style graffiti with his moniker 'ABOVE' on freight trains in California.&lt;ref name="p_155"/&gt; Four years later, Tavar changed from painting traditional letter graffiti to an arrow symbol that pointed 'Above'.&lt;ref&gt;''Graff it'' No. 4, July 2002. (Paris, France)&lt;/ref&gt; Tavar credits an impactful, and pivotal experience where a train he had painted with the letters A-B-O-V-E was leaving the train station and his name was completely illegible due to the increased speed of the departing train. Tavar realized that he needed to find a way for his artwork to connect and be recognized in a fraction of a second.&lt;ref name="p_155"/&gt;

In 2000, at the age of 19, Tavar moved from California to Paris, France. At that time Paris was home to street artists like [[Zevs (artist)|Zevs]], [[Invader (artist)|Invader]], Stak, Honet, and [[Andre (artist)|André]]&lt;ref&gt;''Backspin'' No. 46, July 2003 {{ISSN|1490-6392}} (Berlin, Germany)&lt;/ref&gt; Tavar and the other Parisian artists were part of a movement in street art that was heavily based on characters and logos.&lt;ref name="p_155"/&gt; In 2003, Tavar returned from Paris to California where he introduced his hanging wooden 'Arrow [[Motion (physics)|mobiles]]' from overhead wires. Tavar would later proliferate this hanging process of his 'arrow mobiles' for years to follow.&lt;ref name="p_155"/&gt;

== Travels and artworks ==

=== 2004 ===
[[File:Reno sf 04 005.jpg|thumb|A site-specific wooden arrow mobile that reads "shoe/tree" hung from a tree full of shoes. Nevada, U.S.A. 2004]]
In the summer of 2014, Tavar went on a self-titled "U.S.A. Tour". He drove {{convert|5000|mi}} across the United States hanging 300 plus arrow [[Motion (physics)|mobiles]] in 14 major cities.&lt;ref name="TORONTO NEWSPAPER"&gt;{{cite web|last=Topping |first=David |url=http://torontoist.com/2007/06/tall_poppy_inte_45.php |title=Toronto Newspaper |publisher=Torontoist.com |date=16 June 2007 |accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was during Zawacki's self-titled, U.S.A. tour that he introduced elements of [[word play]] by writing a word on both sides of the spinning arrows to suggest a dialog.&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Newspaper"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pro|first=Johnna A.|title=Artists' arrows aim to make you look up|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/stories/local/uncategorized/artists-arrows-aim-to-make-you-look-up-546307/|accessdate=28 December 2012|newspaper=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|date=14 August 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zawacki has declined to respond to questions about how he is able to hang his mobiles so high, saying, "I value and respect that we all have imaginations and for me to interfere with what your imagination would be wrong."&lt;ref name="Pittsburgh Newspaper" /&gt;

=== 2005 ===
After finishing the U.S.A. tour the previous year, Tavar returned to Europe in 2005. When asked in an interview why he did not hang his arrow mobiles in Europe after his U.S.A. tour, he responded, "In the United States there are an almost infinite amount of overhead telephone wires and street cables. However I was unsure if the different European countries had many overhead wires like in the United States? I decided instead to make wooden arrow that were able to adhere to the sides of buildings, at elevated heights. During my travels around Europe I was able to in fact see that most of the countries I visited had overhead wires to support the future hanging of my arrow mobiles."&lt;ref&gt;''Pulp'' No. 46, Aug/Sep 2005 (Sydney, Australia)&lt;/ref&gt; Tavar visited 15 countries during his 4-month long European tour, installing around 500 of the larger wooden fabric arrows.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;''Bant'' No. 31. Feb 2007 (Istanbul, Turkey)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2006 ===
[[File:Arrow Stack 5.JPG|thumb|right|Tavar Zawacki's wordplay arrow mobiles. Every arrow mobile had a word on each side creating a [[sign language]] once installed.  Tavar installed his arrow mobiles in 26 countries around Europe in 2006.]]

After returning to California, Tavar began planning a new tour which he titled the 'Sign Language Tour'. By his own reports, Tavar [[counterfeit]]ed [[Eurail]] tickets for a six-month duration, spanning 26 countries around Europe.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;''Lodown'' No. 58. Oct/Nov 2007 (Berlin, Germany)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;''Omagiu'' No. 9. June 2007, {{ISSN|1841-4788}} (Bucharest, Romania)&lt;/ref&gt; Tavar's 'Sign Language Tour' focused almost exclusively on his [[word play]] sign language arrow mobiles. Tavar is quoted saying '[[sign language]] is a form of communication using movements instead of sound. I found a lot of charm knowing that the arrow mobiles, once installed, are constantly spinning around. To create a [[dialogue|dialog]] I painted one word on each side of the arrow. [[conceptual art|Conceptually]] speaking, when the wind would spin the arrow mobile there would be a small word play dialog to anyone who looked at it."&lt;ref name="ReferenceB" /&gt; Tavar customized arrows to certain countries language such as French (''J'ai''/''faim'', ''chez''/''vous''), Spanish (''Hace''/''sol'', ''como''/''esta'') German (''uber''/''alle'') and Italian (''ciao/ciao'')."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

=== 2007 ===
In 2007, Tavar expanded from the word play of the previous year by painting larger word play [[mural]]s on the exterior of building facades in [[South America|South]] and Central America. He said in an interview " I wanted to return to painting letters, like the traditional graffiti I did when I was younger, but instead of painting my graffiti name, I wanted to paint word-based art that was [[site specific art|site specific]] and could easily be read and understood.&lt;ref&gt;''Soma'' No. 6 July 2008, (São Paulo, Brasil)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Serie B: second edition No. 18 July 2008 (Madrid, Spain)&lt;/ref&gt; Tavar funded his 'South Central Tour' by working as a waiter in a restaurant in [[Alaska]] for four months in spring 2007.&lt;ref name="Sep 2008"&gt;''Atypica'' No. 32, Sep 2008. {{ISSN|1851-7188}} (Buenos Aires, Argentina)&lt;/ref&gt; His south central tour lasted six months, starting in October 2007 in [[Rio de Janeiro]], Brazil, spanning 18 cities in 13 countries, and ending in [[Mexico City]], Mexico in May 2008.&lt;ref name=autogenerated4&gt;''DIF'' No. 62, October 2008. {{ISSN|1645-5444}} (Lisbon, Portugal)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2008 ===
[[File:ABOVE 2.jpg|thumb|right|250px|"Giving to the poor" stencil in Lisbon, Portugal, addressing the issue of homelessness]]
In September 2008, Tavar traveled to [[Lisbon]], Portugal, where he painted his "Giving to the poor" stencil commenting on the [[social issue]] of [[homelessness]]. Zawacki stated "Every day I walked by this bank [[Automated teller machine|ATM machine]] and this particular homeless woman was sitting in the same place every day begging for money. I found it sadly ironic that just six feet away from here there were people lining up to withdraw money. The sharp social and economic clash inspired me to make this piece."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goabove.com/CUT_IT_OUT.html |title=Cut It Out |publisher=Goabove.com |accessdate=7 September 2010| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100919074156/http://goabove.com/CUT_IT_OUT.html| archivedate= 19 September 2010 | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2008, Tavar returned to California, when the [[New York Stock Exchange]] (NTSE) took a drastic crash, marking a worsening of the [[Great Recession|2008 recession]]. Tavar stenciled on the exterior of a [[Washington Mutual]] building (one of several banks that collapsed during this period) an image of the NYSE bar graph with a downward sloping red line that went all the way down into the street gutter, mimicking the results that occurred just a few days before.

=== 2009 ===
In April, Zawacki created a [[stencil]] mural depicting four children searching for "Easter AIGs" in response to the breaking scandal surrounding [[American International Group]] and the degree to which it profited from the 2008 [[bailout]].

In May 2009, Tavar started another tour of Europe lasting four-months. This tour did not seem to have a title as with most of Zawacki's previous tours. In July, he painted a social and political stencil piece titled 'Bridging The Divide' directly on the [[Berlin Wall]]. The artwork depicted a young girl jumping up, with arm extended trying to grab a [[flower bouquet|bouquet]] of flowers from a person on the opposite side of the Berlin. The painted scene was completed with a smiling guard looking at the young girl jumping. 'Bridging The Divide' was painted on the 20th year anniversary of the [[German reunification]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/5559905 |title=Bridging the divide|via=Vimeo |accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:SoldierBerlinArt.jpg|thumb|right|250px|"Bridge the divide" a site specific stencil &amp; installation on the Berlin Wall. Berlin, Germany. 2009]]

In August 2009, Tavar returned from Europe, and moved to [[Portland, Oregon]]. He started a charitable non-profit project involving Portland's homeless population. Tavar was quoted in an interview, "I wanted to address and draw more attention to the homeless crisis here in Portland. I wanted to learn more about this homeless epidemic by listening directly to the homeless community on an individual person to person level. During the month of November, 2009 I rode my bike around Portland wanting to listen to homeless individuals that wanted to share their story and suggestion on what shelters really help out with services as well as where I should donate the money fund raised from this 'Homeless not hopeless' print."&lt;ref name="goabove.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://goabove.com/Homelessnothopeless.html |title=Home Less, Not Hope Less! |publisher=Goabove.com |accessdate=7 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100923195317/http://goabove.com/Homelessnothopeless.html |archivedate=23 September 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2010 ===
In January 2010, just days after the [[2010 Haiti earthquake|Haiti Earthquakes]], Tavar flew to [[La Havana]], Cuba, to make a site specific stencil commenting on the recent devastation in the neighboring country of Haiti. Tavar's stencil work was titled 'Help Thy Neighbor' and depicted a young Cuban boy with tire raft, first aid medical kit, and a Haitian flag in hand ready to embark to what is assumed, Haiti.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vimeo.com/9452360 |title=Help Thy Neighbor|via=Vimeo |accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

French Stencil artist, [[Blek le Rat]], had selected Tavar (then as ABOVE) to exhibit together for Tavar's first duo exhibition of his career at White Walls Gallery in San Francisco on 1 May 2010. This was Tavar's largest body of work exhibited at a gallery at that time in his career.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Joseph Lumbroso |url=http://www.whitewallssf.com/blog/2010/04/coming-may-1-2010-blek-le-rat-and-above/ |title=Coming May 1, 2010: Blek le Rat and Above – White Walls, SF – Blog |publisher=Whitewallssf.com |accessdate=7 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a press release from White Walls gallery "The meeting of these two artists is a passing of the torch from the original stencil artist to a younger generation of urban artists following in his legacy. Blek let Rat first pioneered stencils in the early 80s as a bold, attention grabbing form of street art that was never before seen. ABOVE is the prominent stencil artist of the new generation, drawing on Blek's methods to project a social message into the urban environment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=RJ Rushmore |url=https://blog.vandalog.com/2010/04/above-blek-le-rat/ |title=ABOVE and Blek le Rat at White Walls|publisher=blog.vandalog.com/ |accessdate=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2011 ===
In January 2011, Tavar flew to Sydney, to prepare for his first solo show, titled ''Here Today Gone Tomorrow''. In the press release for the exhibition, Tavar said that his older brother had passed away in an accidental car crash just three months prior. He was quoted, "I've been consistently traveling the world and the theme, 'Here Today Gone Tomorrow' applies to how I have been living my [[Lifestyle (sociology)|lifestyle]] for the past ten years. It's hard to say goodbye when traveling, and even harder when you don't even get the chance. I was deeply moved by the loss of my brother to make the new body of artworks that dealt with the fragility of life, death, and how important it is to live each day to the fullest."&lt;ref name="Here today gone tomorrow"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.curbsandstoops.com/today-tomorrow/|title=Here today gone tomorrow|publisher=Curbsandstoops.com|accessdate=21 February 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110714122254/http://www.curbsandstoops.com/today-tomorrow/|archivedate=14 July 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The body of work in the exhibition profiled fifteen different celebrities such as; [[Marilyn Monroe]], [[James Dean]], [[Bob Marley]], and [[Princess Diana]], all of which died under the age of 37. [[Screen printing]], and paper [[collage]] mediums were used to recreate the images of the fifteen celebrities assembled on top of an arrow cut from wood.&lt;ref name="Here today gone tomorrow"/&gt;

In October at the height of the global [[Occupy Wall Street]] protest, Tavar flew to Miami, U.S.A. and painted a {{convert|120|foot}} long word play mural that read "Give A Wall St. Banker Enough Rope And He Will Hang Himself." Zawacki's mural incorporated a hanging effigy of a suited banker to the installation. While being interviewed by the ''[[Daily Mail]]'', Tavar said "I tried to clothe him and dress him up as if he was what I imagined a Wall Street banker might wear, it was the cherry on the top of the word play installation." He continued to say, "It's extremely shocking which is part of the point as well. I think it is really gone too far, but then again I think it's my retaliation to how far Wall St, has gotten in general. It is shocking to me when I look at these numbers when I see that one per cent of the people have all of the money." Tavar explained that he was inspired by the proverb "If you give a fool enough rope, he will hang himself" and simply adapted it to fit the theme.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2053904/Occupy-Wall-Street-inspired-artist-hangs-banker-dummy-telephone-wire.html|title=Is this taking the protests too far?

It's extremely aggressive and that's actually the point." His final reply was "Everybody's entitled to their own opinion, and some people will praise it, others will deny it and criticize it, but the point being is that it's getting people talking about the movement."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcmiami.com/news/Occupy-Art-Has-Miami-Motorists-Doing-Double-Take-133233768.html|title=Occupy Art Has Miami Motorists Doing Double-Take|publisher=NBC 6 South Florida |accessdate=4 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2012 ===
In February 2012, Tavar traveled to [[Johannesburg]], South Africa, where he painted a mural commenting on the illegal [[blood diamond]] trade. Tavar appropriated the proverb 'Diamonds are a girl's best friend' and painted the message 'Diamonds are a woman's best friend and a man's worst enemy' on the exterior wall of Jewel City, one of the world's largest diamond exporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://allafrica.com/stories/201205280510.html |title=South Africa: Refurbishments At Jewel City Completed |accessdate=24 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The site specific statement was {{convert|4|meters}} tall and {{convert|80|meters}} in length, spanning the entire city block.&lt;ref name="SAvid"/&gt;

The story of how Tavar was able to trick the owners of Jewel city to paint such a large controversial statement on the exterior of their building without any trouble was, in the artist's words, a 'jewel heist' of his own.&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/blogs/headlines/2012/04/american-graffiti-artist-boasts-prank-mural-south-africa/ |publisher=ABC News |title=American Graffiti Artist Brags About Diamond Mural Prank|accessdate=24 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tavar said, "I was able to get away with this diamond wall heist because I told the owners I would paint in big letters 'Diamonds are a woman's best friend' on the exterior of their building. The owners loved the idea and all quickly agreed."&lt;ref name="SAvid"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://arrestedmotion.com/2012/04/video-streets-above-south-africa/ |title=Video / Streets: ABOVE (South Africa) |accessdate=10 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Tavar, the owners never came outside to inspect, or question his actions.&lt;ref name="SAvid" /&gt; In an interview with a reporter from [[ABC News]], Tavar said, "I decided to take it upon myself to justify lying as I felt that making this controversial statement seen, and topic of blood diamonds talked about more, would justify my actions. I have justified my lying as I feel it created a powerful social and political piece."&lt;ref name="abcnews.go.com"/&gt;

[[File:Spain crisis.jpg|thumb|left|300px|A social and political stencil where Tavar addressed the [[Eurozone]] crisis and more specifically Spain's unemployment. Zaragoza, Spain. 2012]]
In September, amidst the [[Eurozone]] financial crisis, Tavar flew to [[Zaragoza]], Spain. He painted a {{convert|120|foot}} long stencil mural of a queue of [[silhouette]]s accompanied by the statement '24% Desempleados' ('24% unemployed' in English) that were waiting in line for the unemployment office. This social, political, and time sensitive mural addressed the hard financial times that Spain was facing with its highest unemployment rate in the world. At the time that Tavar painted this mural 24.6% of Spaniards were unemployed; for under-25-year olds, 53% were unemployed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/jul/27/spanish-unemployment-record-high |work=The Guardian |title=Spanish unemployment reaches record high of 24.6%|date=27 July 2012 |accessdate=27 July 2012 |location=London |first=Giles |last=Tremlett}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the same month of September, Tavar went to [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, to created a [[Time-lapse photography|time-lapse film]] titled ''#Socialmedia''. He painted a message on the wall, then repainted the wall white, only to repaint a new message. He repeated this process of painting new statements over a duration of two days.&lt;ref name="#socialmedia"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://vimeo.com/48736559 |title=#socialmedia|via=Vimeo |accessdate=2 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tavar's messages were [[sarcasm|sarcastic]] mocks, factual, and confrontational towards society and the uses of [[social media]]. He profiled such social media platforms such as [[:Facebook]], [[:Twitter]], and [[Instagram]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2012/09/04/above-social-media_n_1854352.html  |title=Above's Short Film '#Socialmedia' Half Mocks, Half Embraces Our Addiction (VIDEO, PHOTOS)  |date= 4 September 2012|accessdate=4 September 2012 |work=HuffPost |first=Priscilla |last=Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt; In an interview, Tavar said that he does not use social media such as Facebook, or Twitter, which allowed him to act as an outsider, looking in on how society uses such social media platforms.&lt;ref name="#socialmedia"/&gt;

=== 2013 ===
In August 2013, Tavar created a time relative stencil titled 'Timing Is Everything' in London, England. The colorful stencil painted on the side of a wall depicted a [[break dancer]] positioned upside down, with his arm extended downwards. At night, the context of the stencil is 'activated' by the street light, thus creating a shadow of the nearby street pole directly onto the wall. The stenciled break dancer is now seen in a newer context of balancing himself on top of the street sign's shadow. In an interview Tavar said, "all of my stencil works exist in a [[Site-specific art|site-specific]] context. I have been searching for this fixed shadow in a high visibility location for the past eight months during my global travels. I finally found the perfect shadow in [[Shoreditch]] area of London."&lt;ref name="Timing Is Everything"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1xrun.com/runs/Timing_Is_Everything  |title=ABOVE 'Timing Is Everything' |accessdate=11 February 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Tavar, the main reason why 'the perfect shadow' was so challenging to find was because it needed to exist in a highly trafficked area of a major city.&lt;ref name="Timing Is Everything_2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theatlanticcities.com/arts-and-lifestyle/2013/08/street-art-day-breakdancer-comes-alive-after-dark/6459/|title=Street Art of the Day: A Breakdancer Comes Alive After Dark |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A reporter from the news blog ''[[The Huffington Post]]'' claimed, "If [[Banksy]] and [[James Turrell]] were ever to collaborate, we like to think Tavar Zawacki would be their [[idea|brainchild]]."&lt;ref name="Huffington Post"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/08/08/above-street-art_n_3719890.html  |title=Clever Street Art Only Reveals Itself at Night |work = HuffPost|date= 8 August 2013|accessdate=8 August 2013 |first=Priscilla |last=Frank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of Tavar's street works have topics of social or political issues suggested in the artworks. During an interview he commented, "The Timing Is Everything stencil painted in London was void of any political or social message, but what it did have was an interaction with the city, and how things alter from day to night. The stencil shows how timing, and lighting can be the platform, as well as the [[artistic inspiration|inspiration]] for a piece of work."&lt;ref name="Mashable"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mashable.com/2013/08/12/timing-is-everything/  |title=Street Artist Proves Timing Is Everything With Handstand Graffiti |accessdate=12 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tavar closed the interview by saying, "My main intention with this piece is to have people observe, and re-evaluate their surroundings of how literally, timing is everything."
&lt;ref name="Mashable"/&gt;

=== 2014 ===
In June, Tavar was one of the international artists invited to paint at Artscape mural event held in the city of [[Malmö]], Sweden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artscape.se/artists/|title=artists|accessdate=1 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He painted a mural titled [[Metamorphosis]] on an eight-story tall building in a style replicating the color printing process of [[CMYK]]. He explained, "I've been interested for many years now in shapes and colors. The arrow is its own unique shape, and when I overlap this colorful shape using the CMYK color blend process, it allows for new shapes and colors to metamorphosis into something new." Tavar continued saying, "It's about having fun and experimenting. As an artist it's important for me to experiment with my work, otherwise one can become stagnant. Making this mural put the arrow into a new context, giving it room for expansion of a new life."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oLxtimQisPw |title="Artscape Malmö 2014-Above" On Youtube |via=YouTube |accessdate=25 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September, Tavar had a three-month long [[artist-in-residence]] in Detroit, Michigan in preparation for his solo exhibition titled 'Remix'.&lt;ref name="Above breaks down remix opening November 21st"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1xrun.com/runs/Grand_River_-_Original_Artwork|title=Above breaks down remix opening November 21st |publisher=1xrun.com |accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Remix exhibition displayed a variety of different [[laser cut]] wood panels that were then 'remixed', and exchanged into the artwork's final configuration. "The intention for the Remix body of work is to find a balanced [[symbiosis]] between curved and straight lines. The characteristics of the arrow are straight, sharp, angular, and void of any curved elements. My intention is to mix a variety of curved shapes within the straight arrow design, creating a totally new visual appearance."&lt;ref name="Above Remix @ Innerstate Gallery"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.juxtapoz.com/current/above-remix-inner-state-gallery-detroit|title=Above Remix @ Innerstate Gallery |publisher=juxtapoz.com |accessdate=19 November 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; When asked the question, 'What strides do you think you have made with this work?' Tavar replied, "The variety of new curved elements from the Remix exhibition allowed me to expand the arrow design into something new and exciting. The emphasis was less on the arrow, and more on the mix of curved, and straight lined shapes. The arrow icon was breaking apart and morphing into new (and exciting) abstract shapes."&lt;ref name="Above breaks down remix opening November 21st"/&gt;

=== 2015 ===

In October 2015 Tavar painted his largest mural to date, a 33-meter tall (108 feet) by 17-meter wide (55 feet) mural titled 'Incognito' in [[Johannesburg]], South Africa as part of the City of Gold Festival.&lt;ref name="An Interview with ABOVE about his latest mural 'Incognito' in Johannesburg"/&gt; Tavar spent ten consecutive days painting the mural and when asked in an interview about his process, challenges, and color choices he stated 'My color selections were predetermined by the relationship of how each color transforms when laid on top of another. This was easy, however, in the designing of the mural I had to constantly move colors and shapes to finally get the final color arrangement you see. The biggest challenge for me during the Incognito mural was ensuring the proportions of the design were correct. I needed precision, and a lot of it.  The lines needed to be sharp and straight. If any line was miscalculated or skewed the design as a whole would suffer. This was my largest hurdle I had to overcome both with mapping it out, and painting it. Later in the interview Tavar said 'What I enjoy most about the Incognito design is the secondary shapes, and colors achieved from the overlapping of each arrow on top of another. There are many fun intersections of color and new shapes that emerge using this style of design. I look forward to exploring more in depth into this style in the future in my indoor and outdoor works.'&lt;ref name="An Interview with ABOVE about his latest mural 'Incognito' in Johannesburg"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://instagrafite.com/an-interview-with-above-about-his-latest-mural-incognito-in-joburg%E2%80%8F/|title=An Interview with ABOVE about his latest mural 'Incognito' in Johannesburg |publisher=instagrafite.com/ |accessdate=30 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2016 ===
In March, Tavar Zawacki (still using his former street artist name 'ABOVE') had a solo exhibition in [[Zürich]], Switzerland titled '12 Months'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lin|first1=Amy|title=12 Months With ABOVE the Artist at Galerie SOON|url=https://www.widewalls.ch/above-the-artist-galerie-soon-zurich/|website=Wide Walls|accessdate=26 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In a section of Tavar's [[artist statement]] he wrote, 'My intention with my recent body of work is to show the viewer a visual portrayal of associations, and experiences I’ve had with each Month. This body of work explores new ways of incorporating my arrow icon into a variety of [[patterns]], configurations, and abstract styles, while using the entire color spectrum as my [[Color scheme|palette]]. My process started with reflecting back on each year, making detailed lists of colors, feelings, and associations I have with each month. I would use my written notes and transform these words into the visual designs of shape and color, you see in each painting.
I aimed to create each work with a unique feeling, while still having a consistency within the body of work. I intended to have my arrow icon act as the supporting role in every month’s composition. My goal is to have the arrow interact, transform, and re-create its shape as much as possible, helping illustrate the emotion and feeling of each month. During my creative process the consistent changing of colors, and emotions of each month both inspired, and challenged me.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zawacki|first1=Tavar|title=12 Months|url=http://www.tavarzawacki.com/indoor/#/12-months/|website=Tavarzawacki.com|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 2016, Tavar Zawacki served as artist-in-residence of the Quin Arts program at [[the Quin Hotel]] in New York City, furthering his exploration of [[geometric abstraction]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Zimmer|first1=Lori|title=Art Nerd New York's Top Event Picks for the Week- 7/14-7/20|url=http://www.6sqft.com/art-nerd-new-yorks-top-event-picks-for-the-week-714-720/|website=Art Nerd|accessdate=14 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; through colorful multi-layer arrow compositions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ABOVE AT THE QUIN HOTEL.

It opened on 14 July and was Zawacki's first solo show in New York City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Eller|first1=Matthew|title=Tavar Zawacki aka ABOVE Solo Show 07/14/16 at The Quin, NYC|url=https://streetartnews.net/2016/07/preview-tavar-zawacki-aka-above-solo-show-071416-at-the-quin-nyc.html|website=Street Art News|accessdate=13 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 2017 ===

In January 2017, Tavar decided to step out of his self-imposed shadow of anonymity, and start creating, and signing his artworks with his real birth name - allowing more freedom of creative exploration, as well as freedom from the arrow icon he had formerly associated himself with. Tavar stated, 'My decision suddenly liberated me, as well as opened up creative ideas to a seemingly unlimited expansion of new opportunities. I see a new foundation to expand upon, free of any artistic restrictions, and my curiosity to push my creative limits to new, higher levels'.&lt;ref name="BIO"/&gt;

Tavar debuted his museum style solo exhibition titled, [[Metamorphosis]] in September, 2017, at Urban Spree Galerie in Berlin.
Metamorphosis' entire body of work was painted on large format canvases, and profiled four different painting styles, [[Op-Art]], [[Trompe l'oeil]], [[CMYK]] and [[Hard-edge painting]].&lt;ref name="Metamorphosis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tavarzawacki.com/metamorphosis|title=Metamorphosis |publisher=tavarzawacki.com |accessdate=16 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tavar described his exhibition, 'Metamorphosis is about transformation from one state into a newer dynamic one. With a lot of brutal honesty, and conviction for growth I was able to take inner inventory of what no longer served me. I was able to let go of the fears that were stifling my creative progression. I was prepared for feeling uncomfortable during this metamorphosis. I was learning how to unblock my personal censors, and be valiant in painting the styles of works I’ve previously been too reluctant to paint.'&lt;ref name="Tavar Zawacki: Metamorphosis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanspree.com/event/tavar-zawacki-metamorphosis/|title=Tavar Zawacki: Metamorphosis |publisher=urbanspree.com |accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tavar Zawacki's Metamorphosis exhibition was the first time in his career that he made, and signed all his works with his real name.&lt;ref name="Tavar Zawacki Goes through Metamorphosis at Urban Spree"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.widewalls.ch/tavar-zawacki-art-urban-spree/|title=Tavar Zawacki Goes through Metamorphosis at Urban Spree |publisher=www.widewalls.ch |accessdate=1 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September Tavar's second book, also titled, Metamorphosis was published. Metamorphosis is a 168-page, hardcover book covering Tavar's last 3 years of creative works, from his seminal 2014 Remix exhibition in Detroit, to his latest and most ambitious show to date at Urban Spree Galerie in September 2017. The book covers all his outdoor murals during that period and illustrates how the artist navigates between his indoor and outdoor works and the influences thereof.&lt;ref name="Tavar Zawacki: Metamorphosis (Signed Copies)"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.urbanspree.com/shop/en/street-artgraffiti/1000-tavar-zawacki-metamorphosis.html|title=Tavar Zawacki: Metamorphosis (Signed Copies) |publisher=www.urbanspree.com |accessdate=29 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Passport: 156 page book documenting the artworks and travels of Tavar Zawacki in over 60 countries from 2004 to 2010. California: Zero+ Publishing, 2011.

Artist [[Shepard Fairey]] wrote the introduction in Passport saying "I first encountered Above's art on the streets of Paris in early 2003. His large scale trademark arrows were painted on roll down gates, trucks and storefronts with impressive coverage throughout the city. Above is extraordinarily driven. To paraphrase [[Radiohead]], "ambition can make you look pretty ugly," but in Above's case, his ambition makes the streets look very engaging. I am very impressed by Above's diligence, but after I got to know him and his artwork more, I began to realize that his output is not evidence of selfish ego, but of a lust for life, a utopian life, where his generosity, and curiosity, and his pursuit of creativity and social-consciousness have led him around the world making more friends than enemies.

Above made the time to act as tour guide for me and my wife and our two young daughters in a city he knows well and we didn't. The gesture made me greatly value Above's friendship and reinforced my belief that what you give is what you get. The Karma Police are not coming for Above even if the police vandal squad is."&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- cite book --&gt;Above, ''Above:Passport''. California: Zero+ Publishing, 2011.page08.

'''''The End of Work: The Decline of the Global Labor Force and the Dawn of the Post-Market Era''''' is a non-fiction book by American economist [[Jeremy Rifkin]], published in 1995 by [[Putnam Publishing Group]].&lt;ref name="Rifkin 1995"&gt;{{cite book| author = Rifkin, Jeremy | title = The End of Work: The Decline of the Global Labor Force and the Dawn of the Post-Market Era | publisher = Putnam Publishing Group | year = 1995 | isbn = 0-87477-779-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Synopsis==
In 1995, Rifkin contended that [[List of countries by unemployment rate|worldwide unemployment]] would increase as information technology eliminated tens of millions of [[employment|job]]s in the manufacturing, agricultural and [[service sector]]s. He predicted devastating impact of [[automation]] on [[blue-collar]], retail and [[wholesale]] employees. While a small elite of corporate managers and [[knowledge worker]]s would reap the benefits of the high-tech [[world economy]], the [[American middle class]] would continue to shrink and the [[wiktionary:Workplace|workplace]] become ever more [[Stress (medicine)|stressful]].

As the [[market economy]] and [[public sector]] decline, Rifkin predicted the growth of a [[Voluntary sector|third sector]]&amp;mdash;voluntary and community-based service organizations&amp;mdash;that would create new jobs with government support to rebuild [[urban decay|decaying neighborhoods]] and provide [[social services]]. To finance this enterprise, he advocated scaling down the [[military budget]], enacting a [[value added tax]] on nonessential [[goods and services]] and redirecting [[Administration of federal assistance in the United States|federal]] and state funds to provide a "[[social wage]]" in lieu of [[welfare payment]]s to third-sector workers.&lt;ref name="Rifkin 1995"/&gt;

==Critical reception==
{{Expand section|date=August 2007}}
A number of economists and [[sociologist]]s have been critical of Jeremy Rifkin for being one of the major contributors to the "end of work" discourse and literature of the 1990s. [[Autonomism|Autonomist]] political philosopher [[George Caffentzis]] concluded that Rifkin's argument is flawed because it is based on a [[technological determinism]] that does not take into account the dynamics of employment and [[technocapitalism|technological change in the capitalist era]].&lt;ref name="Caffentzis98"&gt;Caffentzis (1998)&lt;/ref&gt; It is also argued that Rifkin's historical analysis of technological unemployment in United States southern agriculture was not shared by [[Martin Luther King]], who believed the problem was lack of [[US labor law|labor rights]].&lt;ref&gt;ML King, ''Speech to the Fourth Constitutional Convention AFL-CIO, Miami, Florida'' ([https://kinginstitute.stanford.edu/king-papers/documents/address-delivered-fourth-constitutional-convention-afl-cio 11 December 1961]). See E McGaughey, 'Will Robots Automate Your Job Away? Full Employment, Basic Income, and Economic Democracy' (2018) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=3044448 SSRN, part 2(2), 13]&lt;/ref&gt; More recent research suggest the invention and distribution of computers during the 1990s increased employment.&lt;ref&gt;J Bessen, ‘How Computer Automation Affects Occupations: Technology, jobs, and skills’ (2016) [https://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2690435 Boston University, Law &amp; Economics WP No. 15-49]&lt;/ref&gt; 

A major theme of ''The End of Work'' is that productivity would lead to the destruction of jobs; however, the book appeared when productivity growth had been in a slowdown since the early 1970s.  Because the widespread use of computers in the 1980s and early 1990s did not live up to the high expectations for productivity growth, this was called the [[productivity paradox]].  Strong productivity growth finally appeared in the late 1990s and lasted a few years, then slowed down again.  The productivity slowdown is still being debated.&lt;ref&gt;[http://traction.tractionsoftware.com/traction/permalink/Blog1682 The Debate Zone: Has the US passed peak productivity growth? | McKinsey &amp; Company]&lt;/ref&gt; Strong growth but without absorbing large numbers of unemployed people is called a [[jobless recovery]].  Historically, innovation that obsoletes existing jobs and technologies has not created permanent unemployment, but has instead opened jobs in new industries and moved jobs from agriculture to industry and the service sector.  This process is known as [[creative destruction]].

'''''The Governance of Britain''''' was a [[Green Paper]] issued by the [[Government of the United Kingdom|Government]] of [[Gordon Brown]] in 2007. The Green Paper looked at issues of constitutional reform including [[House of Lords]] reform and limiting the powers of the executive.

Its last section on "Citizenship and National identity" was criticized by [[David Beetham]], who expressed "astonishment that so much effort is felt to be necessary chasing a will of the wisp called Britishness" and found its language "prescriptive, even hortatory" [http://www.opendemocracy.net/ourkingdom/2008/04/25/what-is-britishness-citizenship-values-and-identity].

[[File:Für Toleranz.jpg|thumb|Sculpture ''Für Toleranz'' ("for tolerance") by [[Volkmar Kühn]], [[Gera]], Germany ]]
'''Toleration''' is the acceptance of an action, object, or person which one dislikes or disagrees with. ''[[Random House Dictionary]]'' defines tolerance as "a fair, objective, and permissive attitude toward those whose opinions, beliefs, practices, racial or ethnic origins, etc., differ from one's own".&lt;ref&gt;[http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/tolerance "Tolerance"] in ''[[Random House Dictionary]]'' (via dictionary.reference.com).&lt;/ref&gt; Toleration may signify "no more than forbearance and the permission given by the adherents of a dominant religion for other religions to exist, even though the latter are looked on with disapproval as inferior, mistaken, or harmful."&lt;ref&gt;Perez Zagorin, ''How the Idea of Religious Toleration Came to the West'' (Princeton: Princeton University Press 2003) {{ISBN|0691092702}}, pp. 5–6, quoting D.D. Raphael et al.&lt;/ref&gt;

There is only one verb ''to tolerate'' and one adjective ''tolerant'', but the two nouns ''tolerance'' and ''toleration'' have evolved slightly different meanings. Tolerance is a state of mind that implies non-judgmental acceptance of different lifestyles or beliefs,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/tolerance|title= Tolerance|publisher=Merriam Webster|accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; whereas toleration indicates the act of putting up with something that one disapproves of.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/toleration|title= Toleration|publisher=Merriam Webster|accessdate=2012-03-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, most incidents and writings pertaining to toleration involve the status of [[minority influence|minority]] and dissenting viewpoints in relation to a dominant [[state religion]].&lt;ref&gt;Joachim Vahland, 'Toleranzdiskurse', [[Zeno (periodical)|''Zeno'']] no. 37 (2017), pp. 7–25&lt;/ref&gt; In the 20th century and after, analysis of the doctrine of toleration has been expanded to include political and ethnic groups, [[LGBT]] individuals and other minorities, and [[human rights]] embodies the principle of legally enforced toleration.

==Etymology==
Originally from the [[Latin]] ''tolerans'' ([[present participle]] of ''tolerare''; "to bear, endure, tolerate"), the word ''tolerance'' was first used in [[Middle French]] in the 14th century and in [[Early Modern English]] in the early 15th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=tolerance (n.) |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/tolerance#etymonline_v_15343 |website=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]] |accessdate=19 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The word ''toleration'' was first used in English in the 1510s to mean "permission granted by authority, licence" from the French ''tolération'' (originally from the Latin [[past participle]] stem of ''tolerare'', ''tolerationem''), moving towards the meaning of "forbearance, sufferance" in the 1580s.&lt;ref name="toleration (n.)"&gt;{{cite news |title=toleration (n.) |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/toleration#etymonline_v_15344 |accessdate=19 November 2018 |work=[[Online Etymology Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The notion of religious toleration stems from 1609.&lt;ref name="toleration (n.)" /&gt;

==In antiquity==
[[File:Minerva als Symbol der Toleranz.jpg|thumb|Minerva as a symbol of enlightened wisdom protects the believers of all religions ([[Daniel Chodowiecki]], 1791)]]

Religious toleration has been described as a "remarkable feature" of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] of Persia.&lt;ref name=Cambridge&gt;{{cite book|last1=Fisher|first1=William Bayne|last2=Gershevitch|first2=I.|title=The Cambridge History of Iran|date=1968|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9780521200912|page=412|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BBbyr932QdYC&amp;lpg=PA412|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As reported in the [[Old Testament]], king [[Cyrus the Great]] was believed to have released the Jews from captivity in 539–530 BCE, and permitted their return to their homeland.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Book of Ezra {{pipe}} King James Bible |url=http://www.kingjamesbibletrust.org/the-king-james-bible/ezra |publisher=Kingjamesbibletrust.org |accessdate=March 21, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110510013551/http://www.kingjamesbibletrust.org/the-king-james-bible/ezra |archivedate=May 10, 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Cyrus the Great assisted in the restoration of the sacred places of various cities.&lt;ref name=Cambridge /&gt;

The [[Hellenistic empire|Hellenistic]] city of [[Alexandria]], founded 331 BCE, contained a large Jewish community which lived in peace with equivalently sized Greek and Egyptian populations. According to [[Michael Walzer]], the city provided "a useful example of what we might think of as the imperial version of multiculturalism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Michael |last=Walzer |title=On Toleration |location=New Haven |publisher=Yale University Press |year=1997 |isbn= 978-0300076004 |page= 17 |accessdate= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Roman Empire]] encouraged conquered peoples to continue worshipping their own gods. "An important part of Roman propaganda was its invitation to the gods of conquered territories to enjoy the benefits of worship within the ''imperium''."&lt;ref&gt;Witte, John Jr. and Johan D. van de Vyver, ''Religious Human Rights in Global Perspective'' (The Hague: Kluwer 1996) p. 74 {{ISBN|9041101764}}&lt;/ref&gt; Christians were singled out for persecution because of their own rejection of Roman pantheism and refusal to honor the emperor as a god.&lt;ref&gt;Logan, Donald F., ''A history of the church in the Middle Ages'' (New York:Routledge, 2002) {{ISBN|0415132894}}, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; In 311 CE, Roman Emperor [[Galerius]] issued a general [[Edict of Toleration by Galerius|edict of toleration]] of Christianity, in his own name and in those of [[Licinius]] and [[Constantine I]] (who converted to Christianity the following year).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/06341a.htm "Valerius Maximianus Galerius"], Karl Hoeber, Catholic Encyclopedia 1909 Ed, retrieved 1 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical sources==
In the Old Testament, the books of [[Book of Exodus|Exodus]], [[Leviticus]] and [[Deuteronomy]] make similar statements about the treatment of strangers. For example, Exodus 22:21 says: "Thou shalt neither vex a stranger, nor oppress him: for ye were strangers in the land of Egypt".These texts are frequently used in sermons to plead for compassion and tolerance of those who are different from us and less powerful.&lt;ref&gt;February 5, 2008 posting by Rabbi David Kominsky [http://rabbidavidkominsky.wordpress.com/2008/02/05/for-you-were-strangers-in-the-land-of-egypt/ ...For You Were Strangers in the Land of Egypt]. Accessed January 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[Julia Kristeva]] elucidated a philosophy of political and religious toleration based on all of our mutual identities as strangers.&lt;ref&gt;Walzer, Michael ''On Toleration'' (New Haven: Yale University Press 1997) pp. 80–81&lt;/ref&gt;

The New Testament [[Parable of the Tares]], which speaks of the difficulty of distinguishing wheat from weeds before harvest time, has also been invoked in support of religious toleration. In his "Letter to Bishop Roger of Chalons", Bishop [[Wazo of Liege]] (c. 985–1048) relied on the parable&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Richard Landes|title=The Birth of Heresy: A Millennial Phenomenon|journal=Journal of Religious History |volume=24|issue=1|year=2000|pages=26–43 |url=http://www.bu.edu/mille/people/rlpages/TheBirthofHeresy.html|doi=10.1111/1467-9809.00099 }}&lt;/ref&gt; to argue that "the church should let dissent grow with orthodoxy until the Lord comes to separate and judge them".&lt;ref&gt;Jeffrey Burton Russell, ''Dissent and Order in the Middle Ages: The Search for Legitimate Authority'' (New York: Twayne Publishers 1992), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]], a Baptist theologian and founder of Rhode Island, used this parable to support government toleration of all of the "weeds" (heretics) in the world, because civil persecution often inadvertently hurts the "wheat" (believers) too. Instead, Williams believed it was God's duty to judge in the end, not man's. This parable lent further support to Williams' Biblical philosophy of a wall of separation between church and state as described in his 1644 book, ''[[The Bloody Tenent of Persecution]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=James P. Byrd|title=The challenges of Roger Williams: religious liberty, violent persecution, and the Bible|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=M4FK-j35yFYC|accessdate=15 June 2011|year=2002|publisher=Mercer University Press|isbn=978-0865547711}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Middle Ages, the Renaissance, and the Reformation==

In the [[Middle Ages]], there were instances of toleration of particular groups. The Latin concept ''tolerantia'' was a "highly-developed political and judicial concept in mediaeval scholastic theology and canon law."&lt;ref name="Walsham06-234"&gt;Walsham 2006: 234.&lt;/ref&gt; ''Tolerantia'' was used to "denote the self-restraint of a civil power in the face of" outsiders, like infidels, Muslims or Jews, but also in the face of social groups like prostitutes and lepers.&lt;ref name="Walsham06-234"/&gt; Heretics such as the [[Cathari]], [[Waldensians]], [[Jan Hus]], and his followers, the [[Hussites]], were persecuted.&lt;ref&gt;Ellwood, Robert S. and Gregory D.

===Tolerance of the Jews===
In Poland in 1264, the [[Statute of Kalisz]] was issued, guaranteeing freedom of religion for the Jews in the country.

In 1348, [[Pope Clement VI]] (1291–1352) issued a [[Papal bull|bull]] pleading with Catholics not to murder Jews, whom they blamed for the [[Black Death]]. He noted that Jews died of the plague like anyone else, and that the disease also flourished in areas where there were no Jews. Christians who blamed and killed Jews had been "seduced by that liar, the Devil". He took Jews under his personal protection at [[Avignon]], but his calls for other clergy to do so failed to be heeded.&lt;ref&gt;Tuchman, Barbara, A Distant Mirror: The Calamitous 14th Century (New York: Alfred A. Knopf 1978), p. 113&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Johann Reuchlin]] (1455–1522) was a German humanist and a scholar of Greek and Hebrew who opposed efforts by [[Johannes Pfefferkorn]], backed by the Dominicans of Cologne, to confiscate all religious texts from the Jews as a first step towards their forcible conversion to the Catholic religion.&lt;ref&gt;Rummel, Erika, "The case against Johann Reuchlin" (pp. iv–xv) University of Toronto Press, 2002 {{ISBN|0802084842|978-0802084842}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite occasional spontaneous episodes of [[pogroms]] and killings, as during the Black Death, [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] was a relatively tolerant [[Jews in Poland|home for the Jews]] in the medieval period. In 1264, the [[Statute of Kalisz]] guaranteed safety, personal liberties, [[freedom of religion]], trade, and travel to Jews. By the mid-16th century, the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth was home to 80% of the world's Jewish population. Jewish worship was officially recognized, with a Chief Rabbi originally appointed by the monarch. Jewish property ownership was also protected for much of the period, and Jews entered into business partnerships with members of the nobility.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/vjw/Poland.html Poland].

===Vladimiri===
[[Paulus Vladimiri]] (c. 1370–1435) was a Polish scholar and rector who at the [[Council of Constance]] in 1414, presented a thesis, ''Tractatus de potestate papae et imperatoris respectu infidelium'' (Treatise on the Power of the Pope and the Emperor Respecting Infidels). In it he argued that [[paganism|pagan]] and Christian nations could coexist in peace and criticized the [[Teutonic Order]] for its wars of conquest of native non-Christian peoples in Prussia and Lithuania. Vladimiri strongly supported the idea of conciliarism and pioneered the notion of peaceful coexistence among nations—a forerunner of modern theories of [[human rights]]. Throughout his political, diplomatic and university career, he expressed the view that a world guided by the principles of peace and mutual respect among nations was possible and that pagan nations had a right to peace and to possession of their own lands.

===Erasmus===
[[Desiderius Erasmus]] Roterodamus (1466–1536), was a Dutch Renaissance humanist and Catholic whose works laid a foundation for religious toleration. For example, in ''De libero arbitrio'', opposing certain views of [[Martin Luther]], Erasmus noted that religious disputants should be temperate in their language, "because in this way the truth, which is often lost amidst too much wrangling may be more surely perceived." Gary Remer writes, "Like [[Cicero]], Erasmus concludes that truth is furthered by a more harmonious relationship between interlocutors."&lt;ref&gt;Remer, Gary, ''Humanism and the Rhetoric of Toleration'' (University Park: University of Pennsylvania Press 1996) p. 95 {{ISBN|0271028114}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although Erasmus did not oppose the punishment of heretics, in individual cases he generally argued for moderation and against the death penalty. He wrote, "It is better to cure a sick man than to kill him."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=James Anthony Froude|author2=Desiderius Erasmus|title=Life and letters of Erasmus: lectures delivered at Oxford 1893–94|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ussXAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA359|accessdate=15 June 2011|year=1894|publisher=Longmans, Green|pages=359–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===More===
[[Sir Thomas More|Saint Thomas More]] (1478–1535), Catholic Lord Chancellor of [[King Henry VIII]] and author, described a world of almost complete religious toleration in [[Utopia (book)|Utopia]] (1516), in which the Utopians "can hold various religious beliefs without persecution from the authorities."&lt;ref&gt;Marius, Richard ''Thomas More: a biography'' (Cambridge, Ma: Harvard University press, 1999) p. 175 {{ISBN|0674885252}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, More's work is subject to various interpretations, and it is not clear that he felt that earthly society should be conducted the same way as in Utopia. Thus, in his three years as Lord Chancellor, More actively approved of the persecution of those who sought to undermine the Catholic faith in England.&lt;ref&gt;Marius, Richard ''Thomas More: a biography'' (Cambridge, Ma: Harvard University press, 1999) p. 386 {{ISBN|0674885252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reformation===

At the [[Diet of Worms]] (1521), [[Martin Luther]] refused to recant his beliefs citing [[freedom of conscience]] as his justification.&lt;ref&gt;Olmstead, Clifton E. (1960), ''History of Religion in the United States'', Englewood Cliffs, NJ, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; According to Historian [[Hermann August Winkler]], the individual's freedom of conscience became the hallmark of [[Protestantism]].&lt;ref&gt;Winkler, Hermann August (2012), ''Geschichte des Westens. Von den Anfängen in der Antike bis zum 20. Jahrhundert'', Third, Revised Edition, Munich (Germany), p. 152&lt;/ref&gt; Luther was convinced that faith in [[Jesus Christ]] was the free gift of the [[Holy Spirit]] and could therefore not be forced on a person. Heresies could not be met with force, but with preaching the [[gospel]] revealed in the Bible. Luther: "Heretics should not be overcome with fire, but with written sermons." In Luther's view, the worldly authorities were entitled to expel heretics. Only if they undermine the public order, should they be executed.&lt;ref&gt;Ohst, Martin (2005), ''Toleranz/ Intoleranz'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', Fourth Edition, Tübingen (Germany), Volume 8, col. 463&lt;/ref&gt; Later proponents of tolerance such as [[Sebastian Franck]] and Sebastian Castellio cited Luther's position. He had overcome, at least for the Protestant territories and countries, the violent medieval criminal procedures of dealing with heretics. But Luther remained rooted in the Middle Ages insofar as he considered the [[Anabaptists]]' refusal to take oaths, do military service, and the rejection of private property by some Anabaptist groups to be a ''political'' threat to the public order which would inevitably lead to anarchy and chaos.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Bornkamm (1962), ''Toleranz. In der Geschichte des Christentums'', in ''Die Religion in Geschichte und Gegenwart'', Third Edition, Tübingen (Germany), Vol. VI, col. 937–38&lt;/ref&gt; So Anabaptists were persecuted not only in Catholic but also in Lutheran and Reformed territories. However, a number of Protestant theologians such as [[John Calvin]], [[Martin Bucer]], [[Wolfgang Capito]], and [[Johannes Brenz]] as well as [[Philip I, Landgrave of Hesse|Landgrave Philip of Hesse]] opposed the execution of Anabaptists.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Heussi (1957), ''Kompendium der Kirchengeschichte'', Eleventh Edition, Tübingen (Germany), pp. 316, 328&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ulrich Zwingli]] demanded the expulsion of persons who did not accept the Reformed beliefs, in some cases the execution of Anabaptist leaders. The young [[Michael Servetus]] also defended tolerance since 1531, in his letters to [[Johannes Oecolampadius]], but during those years some Protestant theologians such as Bucer and Capito publicly expressed they thought he should be persecuted.&lt;ref&gt;Gonzalez Echeverría, Fco Javier (2012). El Amor a la Verdad. Vida y Obra de Miguel Servet p. 256. "Inherent of human condition is the sickness of believing the rest are impostors and heathen, and not ourselves, because nobody recognizes his own mistakes [..] If one must condemn everyone that misses in a particular point then every mortal would have to be burnt a thousand times. The apostles and Luther himself have been mistaken [..] If I have taken the word, by any reason, it has been because I think it is grave to kill men, under the pretext that they are mistaken on the interpretation of some point, for we know that even the chosen ones are not exempt from sometimes being wrong" (Michael Servetus)&lt;/ref&gt;  The trial against Servetus, an [[Antitrinitarian]], in Geneva was not a case of church discipline but a criminal procedure based on the legal code of the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. Denying the Trinity doctrine was long considered to be the same as [[atheism]] in all churches. The Anabaptists made a considerable contribution to the development of tolerance in the early-modern era by incessantly demanding freedom of conscience and standing up for it with their patient suffering.&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich Bornkamm (1962), col. 939&lt;/ref&gt;

===Castellio===
[[Sebastian Castellio]] (1515–1563) was a French Protestant theologian who in 1554 published under a pseudonym the pamphlet ''Whether heretics should be persecuted (De haereticis, an sint persequendi)'' criticizing [[John Calvin]]'s execution of [[Michael Servetus]]: "When Servetus fought with reasons and writings, he should have been repulsed by reasons and writings." Castellio concluded: "We can live together peacefully only when we control our intolerance. Even though there will always be differences of opinion from time to time, we can at any rate come to general understandings, can love one another, and can enter the bonds of peace, pending the day when we shall attain unity of faith."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Zweig |first=Stefan |year=1951 |title=Erasmus; The Right to Heresy: Castellio against Calvin |location=London |publisher=Cassell |page=312 |oclc=24340377}}&lt;/ref&gt; Castellio is remembered for the often quoted statement, "To kill a man is not to protect a doctrine, but it is to kill a man.&lt;ref&gt;Sebastian Castellio, ''Contra libellum, # 77, Vaticanus''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bodin===
[[Jean Bodin]] (1530–1596) was a French Catholic jurist and political philosopher. His Latin work ''Colloquium heptaplomeres de rerum sublimium arcanis abditis'' ("The Colloqium of the Seven") portrays a conversation about the nature of truth between seven cultivated men from diverse religious or philosophical backgrounds: a natural philosopher, a Calvinist, a Muslim, a Roman Catholic, a Lutheran, a Jew, and a skeptic. All agree to live in mutual respect and tolerance.

===Montaigne===
[[Michel de Montaigne]] (1533–1592), French Catholic essayist and statesman, moderated between the Catholic and Protestant sides in the [[Wars of Religion]]. Montaigne's theory of skepticism led to the conclusion that we cannot precipitously decide the error of others' views. Montaigne wrote in his famous "Essais": "It is putting a very high value on one's conjectures, to have a man roasted alive because of them...To kill people, there must be sharp and brilliant clarity."&lt;ref&gt;E.M. Curley, [http://sitemaker.umich.edu/emcurley/files/montaigneforosemp.pdf "Skepticism and Toleration: the Case of Montaigne"], Accessed February 27, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Edict of Torda===
In 1568, King [[John II Sigismund]] of Hungary, encouraged by his Unitarian Minister Francis David (Dávid Ferenc), issued the [[Edict of Torda]] decreeing religious toleration.

===Maximilian II===
In 1571, Holy Roman Emperor [[Maximilian II, Holy Roman Emperor|Maximilian II]] granted religious toleration to the nobles of Lower Austria, their families and workers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Toleration—Exercitium Religionis Privatum |first=Walter |last=Grossman |journal=Journal of the History of Ideas |volume=40 |issue=1 |year=1979 |pages=129–34 |jstor=2709265 |doi=10.2307/2709265}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Warsaw Confederation, 1573===
[[File:Akt Konfederacji Warszawskiej.jpg|thumb|right|upright=1.2|Original act of the [[Warsaw Confederation]] 1573 – the official sanctioning of religious freedom in the [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth]]]]
The [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] had a long tradition of religious freedom. The right to worship freely was a basic right given to all inhabitants of the Commonwealth throughout the 15th and early 16th centuries, however, complete freedom of religion was officially recognized in the [[Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth]] in 1573 in the [[Warsaw Confederation]]. The Commonwealth kept religious-freedom laws during an era when religious persecution was an everyday occurrence in the rest of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{pn|date=February 2018}}

The Warsaw Confederation was a private compact signed by representatives of all the major religions in Polish and Lithuanian society, in which they pledged each other mutual support and tolerance. The confederation was incorporated into the [[Henrican articles]], which constituted a virtual Polish–Lithuanian constitution.

===Edict of Nantes===
The [[Edict of Nantes]], issued on April 13, 1598, by [[Henry IV of France]], granted Protestants—notably [[Calvinist]] [[Huguenots]]—substantial rights in a nation where Catholicism was the state religion. The main concern was civil unity;&lt;ref&gt;In 1898 the tricentennial celebrated the Edict as the foundation of the coming Age of Toleration; the 1998 anniversary, by contrast, was commemorated with a book of essays under the evocatively ambivalent title, ''Coexister dans l'intolérance'' (Michel Grandjean and Bernard Roussel, editors, Geneva, 1998).&lt;/ref&gt; The Edict separated civil law from religious rights, treated non-Catholics as more than mere schismatics and heretics for the first time, and opened a path for secularism and tolerance. In offering general freedom of conscience to individuals, the edict offered many specific concessions to the Protestants, such as amnesty and the reinstatement of their civil rights, including the right to work in any field or for the State, and to bring grievances directly to the king. The edict marked the end of the religious wars in France that tore apart the population during the second half of the 16th century.

The Edict of Nantes was revoked in 1685 by [[Louis XIV of France|King Louis XIV]] with the [[Edict of Fontainebleau]], leading to renewed persecution of Protestants in France. Although strict enforcement of the revocation was relaxed during the reign of [[Louis XV of France|Louis XV]], it was not until 102 years later, in 1787, when [[Louis XVI of France|Louis XVI]] signed the [[Edict of Versailles]]—known as the [[Edict of Tolerance]]—that civil status and rights to form congregations by Protestants were restored.&lt;ref&gt;[http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_%281787%29.html Encyclopedia of the Age of Political Ideals, ''Edict of Versailles (1787)''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120714094231/http://booking-help.org/book_338_glava_314_Edict_of_Versailles_(1787).html |date=2012-07-14 }}, downloaded 29 January 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the Enlightenment==

Beginning in the [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] commencing in the 1600s, politicians and commentators began formulating theories of religious toleration and basing legal codes on the concept. A distinction began to develop between ''civil tolerance'', concerned with "the policy of the state towards religious dissent".,&lt;ref&gt;John Coffey, ''Persecution and Toleration in Protestant England, 1558–1689''. Longman Publishing Group (2000). {{ISBN|0582304652}}. p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and ''ecclesiastical tolerance'', concerned with the degree of diversity tolerated within a particular church.&lt;ref&gt;Coffey, p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

===Milton===
[[John Milton]] (1608–1674), English Protestant poet and essayist, called in the ''[[Areopagitica]]'' for "the liberty to know, to utter, and to argue freely according to conscience, above all liberties" (applied, however, only to the conflicting Protestant denominations, and not to atheists, Jews, Muslims or even Catholics). "Milton argued for [[disestablishment]] as the only effective way of achieving broad toleration. Rather than force a man's conscience, government should recognize the persuasive force of the gospel."&lt;ref&gt;Hunter, William Bridges ''A Milton Encyclopedia, Volume 8''(East Brunswick, NJ: Associated University Presses, 1980) pp. 71–72 {{ISBN|0838718418}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rudolph II===
In 1609, [[Rudolph II]] decreed religious toleration in [[Bohemia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9064359/Rudolf-II "Rudolph II"], Encyclopædia Britannica 15 Edition, retrieved 1 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

===In the American colonies===
[[File:Large Broadside on the Maryland Toleration Act.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Maryland Toleration Act]], passed in 1649.]]
In 1636, [[Roger Williams (theologian)|Roger Williams]] and companions at the foundation of [[Rhode Island]] entered into a compact binding themselves "to be obedient to the majority only in civil things". Williams spoke of "democracie or popular government."&lt;ref&gt;Heinrich August Winkler, ''Geschichte des Westens. Von den Anfängen in der Antike bis zum 20. Jahrhundert'', Third Edition, 2012, Munich (Germany), p. 262&lt;/ref&gt; Lucian Johnston writes, "Williams' intention was to grant an infinitely greater religious liberty than then existed anywhere in the world outside of the Colony of Maryland." In 1663, Charles II granted the colony a charter guaranteeing complete religious toleration.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, Lucian, ''Religious Liberty in Maryland and Rhode Island'' (Brooklyn: International Catholic Truth Society, 1903), p. 30, 38&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 1636, [[Congregational Churches|Congregationalist]] [[Thomas Hooker]] and a group of companions founded [[Connecticut]]. They combined the [[Democracy|democratic]] form of government that had been developed by the [[Separatist Puritan|Separatist]] Congregationalists in [[Plymouth Colony]] ([[Pilgrim Fathers]]) with unlimited freedom of conscience. Like Martin Luther, Hooker argued that as faith in Jesus Christ was the free gift of the Holy Spirit it could not be forced on a person.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton E. Olmstead, ''History of Religion in the United States'', 1960, Englewood Cliffs, NJ, pp. 74–75&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1649 Maryland passed the [[Maryland Toleration Act]], also known as the Act Concerning Religion, a law mandating religious tolerance for Trinitarian Christians only (excluding [[Nontrinitarian]] faiths). Passed on September 21, 1649 by the assembly of the Maryland colony, it was the first law requiring religious tolerance in the British North American colonies. The [[Calvert family]] sought enactment of the law to protect Catholic settlers and some of the other denominations that did not conform to the dominant [[Anglicanism]] of England and her colonies.

In 1657, [[New Amsterdam]], governed by Dutch [[Calvinism|Calvinists]], granted religious toleration to Jews.&lt;ref&gt;[[Hasia Diner|Hasia R. Diner]], ''The Jews of the United States, 1654 to 2000'', 2004, University of California Press, {{ISBN|0520248481}}, pp. 13–15&lt;/ref&gt; They had fled from Portuguese persecution in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Clifton E. Olmsted (1960) p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;

===Spinoza===
[[Baruch Spinoza]] (1632–1677) was a Dutch Jewish philosopher. He published the [[Theological-Political Treatise]] anonymously in 1670, arguing (according to the Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy) that "the freedom to philosophize can not only be granted without injury to piety and the peace of the Commonwealth, but that the peace of the Commonwealth and Piety are endangered by the suppression of this freedom", and defending, "as a political ideal, the tolerant, secular, and democratic polity". After [[Exegesis|interpreting certain Biblical texts]], Spinoza opted for tolerance and freedom of thought in his conclusion that "every person is in duty bound to adapt these religious dogmas to his own understanding and to interpret them for himself in whatever way makes him feel that he can the more readily accept them with full confidence and conviction."&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/spinoza/ "Barcuch Spinoza"], revised June 2008, ''Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Accessed February 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Locke===
English philosopher [[John Locke]] (1632–1704) published [[A Letter Concerning Toleration]] in 1689. Locke's work appeared amidst a fear that Catholicism might be taking over England, and responds to the problem of religion and government by proposing religious toleration as the answer.
Unlike [[Thomas Hobbes]], who saw uniformity of religion as the key to a well-functioning civil society, Locke argued that more religious groups actually prevent civil unrest. In his opinion, civil unrest results from confrontations caused by any magistrate's attempt to prevent different religions from being practiced, rather than tolerating their proliferation. However, Locke denies religious tolerance for Catholics, for political reasons, and also for atheists because "Promises, covenants, and oaths, which are the bonds of human society, can have no hold upon an atheist". A passage Locke later added to the [[Essay concerning Human Understanding]], questioned whether atheism was necessarily inimical to political obedience.

===Bayle===
[[Pierre Bayle]] (1647–1706) was a French Protestant scholar and philosopher who went into exile in Holland. In his "[[Dictionnaire Historique et Critique]]" and "Commentaire Philosophique" he advanced arguments for religious toleration (though, like some others of his time, he was not anxious to extend the same protection to Catholics he would to differing Protestant sects). Among his arguments were that every church believes it is the right one so "a heretical church would be in a position to persecute the true church". Bayle wrote that "the erroneous conscience procures for error the same rights and privileges that the orthodox conscience procures for truth."&lt;ref&gt;[http://plato.stanford.edu/entries/bayle "Pierre Bayle"], Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy, updated August 19, 2008. Accessed March 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Bayle was repelled by the use of scripture to justify coercion and violence: "One must transcribe almost the whole New Testament to collect all the Proofs it affords us of that Gentleness and Long-suffering, which constitute the distinguishing and essential Character of the Gospel." He did not regard toleration as a danger to the state, but to the contrary: "If the Multiplicity of Religions prejudices the State, it proceeds from their not bearing with one another but on the contrary endeavoring each to crush and destroy the other by methods of Persecution. In a word, all the Mischief arises not from Toleration, but from the want of it."&lt;ref&gt;Joseph LoConte, [http://www.christianitytoday.com/ch/thepastinthepresent/historymatters/goldenrule.html "The Golden Rule of Toleration"]. Accessed March 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Act of Toleration===
The [[Act of Toleration 1689|Act of Toleration]], adopted by the British Parliament in 1689, allowed freedom of worship to Nonconformists who had pledged to the oaths of Allegiance and Supremacy and rejected transubstantiation. The Nonconformists were Protestants who dissented from the Church of England such as Baptists and Congregationalists. They were allowed their own places of worship and their own teachers, if they accepted certain oaths of allegiance.

The Act did not apply to Catholics and non-trinitarians and continued the existing social and political disabilities for Dissenters, including their exclusion from political office and also from universities.

===Voltaire===
François-Marie Arouet, the French writer, historian and philosopher known as [[Voltaire]] (1694–1778) published his ''[[Treatise on Tolerance|Treatise on Toleration]]'' in 1763. In it he attacked religious views, but also said, "It does not require great art, or magnificently trained eloquence, to prove that Christians should tolerate each other. I, however, am going further: I say that we should regard all men as our brothers. What? The Turk my brother? The Chinaman my brother? The Jew? The Siam? Yes, without doubt; are we not all children of the same father and creatures of the same God?"&lt;ref&gt;Voltaire [http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~wldciv/world_civ_reader/world_civ_reader_2/voltaire.html ''A Treatise on Toleration''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060107013835/http://www.wsu.edu:8080/~wldciv/world_civ_reader/world_civ_reader_2/voltaire.html |date=2006-01-07 }} (1763)&lt;/ref&gt; On the other hand, Voltaire in his writings on religion was spiteful and intolerant of the practice of the Christian religion{{citation needed|date=May 2016}}, and  Orthodox rabbi [[Joseph Telushkin]] has claimed that the most significant of Enlightenment hostility against Judaism was found in Voltaire.&lt;ref name="Why?"&gt;[[Dennis Prager|Prager, D]]; [[Joseph Telushkin|Telushkin, J]].

===Lessing===
[[Gotthold Ephraim Lessing]] (1729–1781), German dramatist and philosopher, trusted in a "Christianity of Reason", in which human reason (initiated by criticism and dissent) would develop, even without help by divine revelation. His plays about Jewish characters and themes, such as "Die Juden" and "[[Nathan the Wise|Nathan der Weise]]", "have usually been considered impressive pleas for social and religious toleration".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=R.

===Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen===
The [[Declaration of the Rights of Man and the Citizen]] (1789), adopted by the [[National Constituent Assembly (France)|National Constituent Assembly]] during the [[French Revolution]], states in Article 10: "No-one shall be interfered with for his opinions, even religious ones, provided that their practice does not disturb public order as established by the law."

In 1802, Thomas Jefferson wrote a letter to the [[Danbury Baptists]] Association in which he said:
"...I contemplate with sovereign reverence that act of the whole American people which declared that their legislature should 'make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or prohibiting the free exercise thereof,' thus building a wall of separation between Church &amp; State."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.loc.gov/loc/lcib/9806/danpre.html Jefferson's Letter to the Danbury Baptists (June 1998)&amp;nbsp;– Library of Congress Information Bulletin].

==In the nineteenth century==
The process of legislating religious toleration went forward, while philosophers continued to discuss the underlying rationale.

===Roman Catholic Relief Act===
The [[Roman Catholic Relief Act 1829]] adopted by the Parliament in 1829 repealed the last of the criminal laws (TEST ACTS) aimed at Catholic citizens of Great Britain.

===Mill===
[[John Stuart Mill]]'s arguments in "[[On Liberty]]" (1859) in support of the freedom of speech were phrased to include a defense of religious toleration:
&lt;blockquote&gt; Let the opinions impugned be the belief of God and in a future state, or any of the commonly received doctrines of morality... But I must be permitted to observe that it is not the feeling sure of a doctrine (be it what it may) which I call an assumption of infallibility. It is the undertaking to decide that question ''for others'', without allowing them to hear what can be said on the contrary side. And I denounce and reprobate this pretension not the less if it is put forth on the side of my most solemn convictions.&lt;ref&gt;John Stuart Mill (1806–1873) “On Liberty” 1859. ed. Gertrude Himmelfarb, UK: Penguin, 1985, pp. 83–84&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Renan===
In his 1882 essay "[[What is a Nation?]]", French historian and philosopher [[Ernest Renan]] proposed a definition of nationhood based on "a spiritual principle" involving shared memories, rather than a common religious, racial or linguistic heritage. Thus members of any religious group could participate fully in the life of the nation. "You can be French, English, German, yet Catholic, Protestant, Jewish, or practicing no religion".&lt;ref&gt;Ernest Renan, [http://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Qu%E2%80%99est-ce_qu%E2%80%99une_nation_%3F "Qu'est-ce qu'une nation?"], conference faite en Sorbonne, le 11 Mars 1882. Accessed January 13, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the twentieth century==
In 1948, the [[United Nations]] General Assembly adopted Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]], which states:
&lt;blockquote&gt; Everyone has the right to freedom of thought, conscience and religion; this right includes freedom to change his religion or belief, and freedom, either alone or in community with others and in public or private, to manifest his religion or belief in teaching, practice, worship and observance&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.un.org/Overview/rights.html "The Universal Declaration of Human Rights"], United Nations 1948, retrieved 1 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Even though not formally legally binding, the Declaration has been adopted in or influenced many national constitutions since 1948. It also serves as the foundation for a growing number of international treaties and national laws and international, regional, national and sub-national institutions protecting and promoting human rights including the [[freedom of religion]].

In 1965, The Roman Catholic Church [[Vatican II]] Council issued the decree ''[[Dignitatis humanae]]'' (Religious Freedom) that states that all people must have the right to religious freedom.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/archive/hist_councils/ii_vatican_council/documents/vat-ii_decl_19651207_dignitatis-humanae_en.html ''Dignitatis humanae''], Decree on Religious Freedom, 1965, retrieved 1 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the first [[Day of Prayer|World Day of Prayer for Peace]] was held in Assisi. Representatives of one hundred and twenty different religions came together for prayer to their God or gods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.vatican.va/holy_father/john_paul_ii/speeches/1986/october/documents/hf_jp-ii_spe_19861027_prayer-peace-assisi-final_en.html "Address of John Paul II to the Representatives of the Christian Churches and Ecclesial Communities and of the World Religions"] (1986) retrieved 1 June 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, in the spirit of [[Glasnost]], Soviet premier [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] promised increased religious toleration.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/eb/article-9109504/Russia "Russia"], Encyclopædia Britannica. Retrieved on 2011-06-15.&lt;/ref&gt;

==In other religions==
Other major world religions also have texts or practices supporting the idea of religious toleration.

===Hindu religion===
The [[Rigveda]] says ''Ekam Sath Viprah Bahudha Vadanti'' which translates to "The truth is One, but sages call it by different Names".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.religioustolerance.org/hinduism2.htm |title=Hinduism – a general introduction |publisher=Religioustolerance.org |date= |accessdate=2012-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Consistent with this tradition, [[India]] chose to be a secular country even though it was divided [[Partition of India|partitioning]] on religious lines. Whatever intolerance, Hindu scholars displayed towards other religions was subtle and symbolic and most likely was done to present a superior argument in defence of their own faith. Traditionally, Hindus showed their intolerance by withdrawing and avoiding contact with those whom they held in contempt, instead of using violence and aggression to strike fear in their hearts. Hinduism is perhaps the only religion in the world which showed remarkable tolerance towards other religions in difficult times and under testing conditions. Even Buddhism, which spread in India mostly through negative campaigns against Hinduism, cannot claim that credit. Criticizing other religions and showing them in poor light to attract converts to its own fold was never an approved practice in Hinduism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hinduwebsite.com/hinduism/h_tolerance.asp|title=evidence of tolerance|publisher=Jayaram V/Aniket Patil|date=|accessdate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pluralism and tolerance of diversity are built into [[Hindu]] theology India's long history is a testimony to its tolerance of religious diversity. [[Christianity]] came to [[India]] with St. Thomas in the first century CE, long before it became popular in the West. [[Judaism]] came to India after the [[Temple in Jerusalem|Jewish temple]] was destroyed by the Romans in 70 CE and the Jews were expelled from their homeland. In a recent book titled "Who are the Jews of India?" (University of California Press, 2000), author [[Nathan Katz (professor)|Nathan Katz]] observes that India is the only country where the [[Jews]] were not persecuted. The [[Indian people|Indian]] chapter is one of the happiest of the [[Jewish Diaspora]]. Both Christians and Jews have existed in a predominant Hindu India for centuries without being persecuted. Zoroastrians from [[Persia]] (present day [[Iran]]) entered India in the 7th century to flee Islamic conquest. They are known as [[Parsis]] in India. The [[Parsis]] are an affluent community in the city of [[Mumbai]]. Once treated as foreigners, they remain a minority community, yet still housing the richest business families in India; for example, the [[Tata family]] controls a huge industrial empire in various parts of the country. [[Indira Gandhi|Mrs. Indira Gandhi]], the powerful Prime Minister of [[India]] (1966–77; 1980–84), was married to [[Feroze Gandhi|Feroz Gandhi]], a Parsi (no relation to [[Mahatma Gandhi]]).
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://uwf.edu/lgoel/documents/AReligiousToleranceandHinduism.pdf|title=Religious Tolerance and Hinduism |publisher=Dr. M. Lal Goel/Aniket|date=|accessdate=2014-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Islam===
{{See also|Al-Baqara 256}}

The [[Qur'an]], albeit having given importance to its 'true believers', commands its followers to tolerate 'the people of all faiths and communities' and to let them command their dignity, without breaking the [[Shariah]] law. 

Certain verses of the [[Qur'an]] were interpreted to create a specially tolerated status for [[People of the Book]], Jewish and Christian believers in the Old and New Testaments considered to have been a basis for Islamic religion:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Verily! Those who believe and those who are Jews and Christians, and Sabians, whoever believes in God and the Last Day and do righteous good deeds shall have their reward with their Lord, on them shall be no fear, nor shall they grieve.&lt;ref&gt;Quran 2:62&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Under [[Sharia|Islamic law]], Jews and Christians were considered [[dhimmi]]s, a legal status inferior to that of a Muslim but superior to that of other non-Muslims.

[[History of the Jews in Turkey#Ottoman era|Jewish communities in the Ottoman Empire]] held a protected status and continued to practice their own religion, as did Christians, though both were subject to additional restrictions, such as restrictions on the areas where they could live or work or in clothing,&lt;ref name=classicalage&gt;H. Inalcik; The Ottoman Empire: The Classical Age 1300–1600, Phoenix Press, (2001)&lt;/ref&gt; and both had to pay additional taxes.&lt;ref&gt;D. Quataert, The Ottoman Empire, 1700–1922, CUP, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; Yitzhak Sarfati, born in Germany, became the Chief Rabbi of [[Edirne]] and wrote a letter inviting European Jews to settle in the [[Ottoman Empire]], in which he asked: "Is it not better for you to live under Muslims than under Christians?'".&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard Lewis|B. Lewis]], "The Jews of Islam", New York (1984), pp. 135–36&lt;/ref&gt; Sultan [[Beyazid II]] (1481–1512), issued a formal invitation to the Jews expelled from Catholic Spain and Portugal, leading to a wave of Jewish immigration.

According to Michael Walzer:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The established religion of the [Ottoman] empire was Islam, but three other religious communities—Greek Orthodox, Armenian Orthodox, and Jewish—were permitted to form autonomous organizations. These three were equal among themselves, without regard to their relative numerical strength. They were subject to the same restrictions vis-à-vis Muslims—with regard to dress, proselytizing, and intermarriage, for example—and were allowed the same legal control over their own members.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Walzer, ''On Toleration'' (New Haven: Yale University Press, 1997) {{ISBN|0300076002}} p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Buddhism===

Although [[Bhikkhu Bodhi]] states that [[Gautama Buddha|the Buddha]] taught "the path to the supreme goal of the holy life is made known only in his own teaching", Buddhists have nevertheless shown significant tolerance for other religions: "Buddhist tolerance springs from the recognition that the dispositions and spiritual needs of human beings are too vastly diverse to be encompassed by any single teaching, and thus that these needs will naturally find expression in a wide variety of religious forms."&lt;ref&gt;Bhikkhu Bodhi, [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/lib/authors/bodhi/bps-essay_24.html "Tolerance and Diversity"]. ''Access to Insight'', 5 June 2010. Accessed March 6, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; [[James Freeman Clarke]] said in ''Ten Great Religions'' (1871): "The Buddhists have founded no Inquisition; they have combined the zeal which converted kingdoms with a toleration almost inexplicable to our Western experience."&lt;ref&gt;Tweed, Thomas, ''The American Encounter with Buddhism, 1844–1912'' (Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press 2000) p. 101 {{ISBN|0807849065}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Edicts of Ashoka]] issued by King [[Ashoka the Great]] (269–231 BCE), a Buddhist, declared ethnic and religious tolerance. His Edict XII, engraved in stone, stated: "The faiths of others all deserve to be honored for one reason or another. By honoring them, one exalts one's own faith and at the same time performs a service to the faith of others."&lt;ref&gt;Kristin Scheible, "Towards a Buddhist Policy of Tolerance: the case of King Ashoka" in Neusner, Jacob, ed. ''Religious Tolerance in World Religions'' (West Conshohocken, PA, Templeton Foundation Prsss 2008) p. 323&lt;/ref&gt;

However, Buddhism has also had controversies regarding toleration. See [[Dorje Shugden Controversy]]. In addition, the question of possible intolerance among Buddhists in Sri Lanka and Myanmar, primarily against Muslims,  has been raised by Paul Fuller.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=http://content.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,2146000,00.html | title=The Face of Buddhist Terror| journal=Time| date=July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tolerance and digital technologies ==
The development of new digital technologies has resulted in an [[exponential growth]] in the volume of [[information]] and [[knowledge]] available, and made them more readily accessible to greater numbers of people throughout the world. As such, [[Information and communications technology|information and communication technologies]] can play an essential role in the sharing of knowledge and expertise in the service of [[sustainable development]] and in a spirit of solidarity. And yet, for many observers, the world is witnessing rising levels of ethnic, cultural and [[religious intolerance]], often using the same communication technologies for ideological and political mobilization to promote exclusivist worldviews. This mobilization often leads to further criminal and political violence and to armed conflict.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0023/002325/232555e.pdf|title=Rethinking Education: Towards a global common good?|last=|first=|publisher=UNESCO|year=2015|isbn=978-9231000881|location=|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt; This also leads to new modes of intolerance such as [[cyberbullying]].

==Modern analyses and critiques==

Contemporary commentators have highlighted situations in which toleration conflicts with widely held moral standards, national law, the principles of national identity, or other strongly held goals. Michael Walzer notes that the British in India tolerated the Hindu practice of [[suttee]] (ritual burning of a widow) until 1829. On the other hand, the United States declined to tolerate the [[Mormon]] practice of [[polygamy]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael Walzer, ''On Toleration'', (New Haven: Yale University Press 1997) p. 61 {{ISBN|0300076002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Islamic veil controversy in France|French head scarf controversy]] represents a conflict between religious practice and the French secular ideal.&lt;ref&gt;John Bowen, [http://bostonreview.net/BR29.1/bowen.html "Muslims and Citizens"], ''The Boston Review'' February–March 2004. Accessed January 25, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Toleration of the [[Romani people]] in European countries is a continuing issue.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.economist.com/node/17043366 "Romanies: A long road"], ''The Economist'' September 16, 2010. Accessed March 22, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern definition===
Historian Alexandra Walsham notes that the modern understanding of the word "toleration" may be very different from its historic meaning.&lt;ref name="Walsham06-233"&gt;Alexandra Walsham, ''Charitable Hatred: Tolerance and Intolerance in England, 1500–1700''. Manchester University Press (2006) {{ISBN|0719052394}} p. 233.&lt;/ref&gt; Toleration in modern parlance has been analyzed as a component of a liberal or [[Libertarianism|libertarian]] view of [[human rights]]. Hans Oberdiek writes, "As long as no one is harmed or no one's fundamental rights are violated, the state should keep hands off, tolerating what those controlling the state find disgusting, deplorable or even debased. This for a long time has been the most prevalent defense of toleration by liberals... It is found, for example, in the writings of American philosophers [[John Rawls]], [[Robert Nozick]], [[Ronald Dworkin]], [[Brian Barry]], and a Canadian, [[Will Kymlicka]], among others."&lt;ref&gt;Oberdiek, Hans, ''Tolerance: between forebearance and acceptance'' (Lanham, Maryland: Rowman and Littlefield, 2001) p. vi {{ISBN|0847687856}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Isaiah Berlin]] attributes to [[Herbert Butterfield]] the notion that "toleration... implies a certain disrespect. I tolerate your absurd beliefs and your foolish acts, though I know them to be absurd and foolish. Mill would, I think, have agreed."&lt;ref&gt;Isaiah Berlin, "Four Essays on Liberty," London, Oxford and New York: Oxford University Press, 1969, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Gray (philosopher)|John Gray]] states that "When we tolerate a practice, a belief or a character trait, we let something be that we judge to be undesirable, false or at least inferior; our toleration expresses the conviction that, despite its badness, the object of toleration should be left alone."&lt;ref&gt;John Gray, "Enlightenment's Wake," London and New York: Routledge, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, according to Gray, "new liberalism—the
liberalism of Rawls, Dworkin, Ackerman and suchlike" seems to imply that "it is wrong for government to discriminate in favour of, or against, any form of life animated by a definite conception of the good".&lt;ref&gt;Gray (1995), p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[John Rawls]]' "theory of 'political liberalism' conceives of toleration as a pragmatic response to the fact of diversity". Diverse groups learn to tolerate one another by developing "what Rawls calls 'overlapping consensus': individuals and groups with diverse metaphysical views or 'comprehensive schemes' will find reasons to agree about certain principles of justice that will include principles of toleration".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/tolerati/ "Toleration"], ''The Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Accessed March 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Herbert Marcuse]] wrote "''[[Repressive Tolerance]]''" in 1965 where he argued that the "''pure tolerance''" that permits all favors [[totalitarianism]], [[democracy]], and [[tyranny of the majority]], and insisted the "''repressive tolerance''" against them.

===Tolerating the intolerant===
{{main article|Paradox of tolerance}}

Walzer, [[Karl Popper]]&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper, ''The Open Society and Its Enemies'', Vol. 1, Notes to the Chapters: Ch. 7, Note 4.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[John Rawls]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=TdvHKizvuTAC&amp;pg=PA216&amp;lpg=PA216#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false John Rawls, ''A Theory of Justice'', Harvard University Press, 1971, p. 216.]&lt;/ref&gt; have discussed the paradox of tolerating intolerance. Walzer asks "Should we tolerate the intolerant?" He notes that most minority religious groups who are the beneficiaries of tolerance are themselves intolerant, at least in some respects.&lt;ref&gt;Michael Walzer, ''On Toleration'', (New Haven: Yale University Press 1997) pp. 80–81 {{ISBN|0300076002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rawls argues that an intolerant sect should be tolerated in a tolerant society unless the sect directly threatens the security of other members of the society. He links this principle to the stability of a tolerant society, in which members of an intolerant sect in a tolerant society will, over time, acquire the tolerance of the wider society.

===Other criticisms and issues===
Toleration has been described as undermining itself via [[moral relativism]]: "either the claim self-referentially undermines itself or it provides us with no compelling reason to believe it. If we are skeptical about knowledge, then we have no way of knowing that toleration is good."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/tolerati/#H5 "Toleration"], ''The Internet encyclopedia of Philosophy'', Accessed March 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ronald Dworkin]] argues that in exchange for toleration, minorities must bear with the criticisms and insults which are part of the freedom of speech in an otherwise tolerant society.&lt;ref&gt;Ronald Dworkin, [https://www.theguardian.com/world/2006/feb/14/muhammadcartoons.comment "Even bigots and Holocaust deniers must have their say"], ''The Guardian'', February 14, 2006. retrieved March 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Dworkin has also questioned whether the United States is a "tolerant secular" nation, or is re-characterizing itself as a "tolerant religious" nation, based on the increasing re-introduction of religious themes into conservative politics. Dworkin concludes that "the tolerant secular model is preferable, although he invited people to use the concept of personal responsibility to argue in favor of the tolerant religious model."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.law.virginia.edu/html/news/2006_spr/dworkin.htm "Dworkin Explores Secular, Religious Models for Society"], ''Virginia Law School News and Events'', April 18, 2008. accessed March 21, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[The End of Faith]]'', [[Sam Harris (author)|Sam Harris]] asserts that society should be unwilling to tolerate unjustified religious beliefs about morality, spirituality, politics, and the origin of humanity, especially beliefs which promote violence.

'''William Harris''' (1867–1931) was an early [[Western Australian]] leader for [[Indigenous Australians|Aboriginal]] [[civil rights]].&lt;ref name=" Harris, William (1867 - 1931) Biographical Entry "&gt;{{cite web |url=http://adbonline.anu.edu.au/biogs/A090213b.htm|title= Biographical Entry |work=Australian Dictionary of Biography Online}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1867 - Born in Western Australia, he received a rudimentary education as a private pupil at the Swan Native and Half-Caste Mission, before educating himself to a considerable extent.

1904 – While working at the ports and on stations in the Ashburton and Gascoyne districts of Western Australia, Harris witnessed the brutish and cruel practices used to oppress, disenfranchise and subjugate the local Aboriginal people. After ''The Times'' (London) and the Australia press published an account of the ill-treatment of Aboriginal people in the Nor’-West of the State, Harris entered public debate about the issue with a letter to the press accusing the Colonial Secretary, [[Walter Kingsmill]] of willful hypocrisy and misrepresentation. Kingsmill had vehemently denied there was any evidence of the ill-treatment of Aboriginal people. Harris also criticized the Chief Protector of Aborigines for Western Australia, Henry Charles [[Prinsep]] for turning Aboriginal people off their land.

At the time the State Registrar-General, Malcolm A.C. Fraser had Harris in mind for a temporary position with the State Government to compile the vocabulary and descriptions of Aboriginal customs from different portions of the State together for posterity. Within weeks of the publication of Harris’s letter Malcolm Fraser appointed journalist Mrs [[Daisy Bates (Australia)|Daisy Bates]] to the position.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Queen of Deception|last = Lomas|first = Brian|publisher = Amazon|year = 2015|isbn = 9781517053857|location = |pages = 47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1906 – While prospecting in the Eastern Goldfields of Western Australia, Harris observed extensive starvation  and disease among the local Aboriginal population. Harris was so concerned by what he witnessed that he traveled to Perth and on February 8, 1906, Harris and the Goldfields MP, [[Patrick Lynch (Australian politician)|Patrick Lynch]] M.L.A. met with the State Premier, Mr C.H. [[Rason Ministry|Rason]]. Harris explained that the Aboriginal people living on the eastern goldfields were in desperate need of food and medicine and handed Premier Rason a letter signed by the local Justices of the Peace lending their support. Harris also had a meeting with the Chief Protector of Aborigines, Mr Prinsep in an effort to persuade the Aborigines Department to supply rations, clothes and medicine to those starving and diseased.

1921 - When Mrs Daisy Bates began making national headlines with sensational stories accusing the Aboriginal people of cannibalism,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = ABORIGINALS STILL CANNIBALS|last = Bates|first = Daisy|date = 13 May 1921|work = Barrier Miner (Broken Hill, NSW)|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; William Harris was one of very few who contested her allegations. In her rejoinder to a published letter by Harris disputing her views,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Proposed Aboriginal Reserve|last = Harris|first = William|date = 4 September 1921|work = Sunday Times (Perth WA)|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; she wrote, ‘the only good half-caste is a dead one.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = Aboriginal Reserves|last = Bates|first = Daisy|date = 2 October 1921|work = Sunday Times, Perth WA.|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; William Harris reproached her comment as “a stigma on a small class of people whose position in the community was an unenviable one”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = TREATMENT OF HALF-CASTES, Mrs Daisy Bates Reproached.|last = Harris|first = William|date = 8 January 1922|work = Sunday Times, Perth WA.|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

1926 – Alarmed at the persecution inflicted upon Aboriginal people by the West Australian Aborigines Department and its officials, he voiced the intention to form the Native Union of Western Australia. Harris was particularly concerned about conditions at Mogumber ([[Moore River Native Settlement]]) after the Chief Protector of Aborigines [[A. O. Neville]] changed the settlements purpose from an Aboriginal farming community to an internment camp.

1928 – In March 1928 William Harris headed the first Aboriginal deputation to meet with a West Australian Premier [[Philip Collier]]. Wilfred Morrison, Edward Jacobs, Arthur Kickett, William Bodney, William Harris, his brother Edward and his nephew Norman Harris met with the Premier  for an hour and half.[http://www.slwa.wa.gov.au/federation/popup/400.htm] They asked the Premier to repeal the Aborigines Act 1905 and give Aboriginal people the same rights at the white community. Describing the conditions at Mogumber as intolerable, they implored him to close it down. Because Aboriginal people were prohibited from entering central Perth, throughout the meeting they referred to Perth as ‘white city’.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url = |title = NATIVES' WORST ENEMY|last = |first = |date = 9 March 1928|work = The Daily News (Perth, WA).|access-date = |via = }}&lt;/ref&gt; William Harris also told Premier Collier that Mrs Daisy Bates and Chief Protector Neville were the worst enemies of the Aboriginal people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Queen of Deception|last = Lomas|first = Brian|publisher = Amazon|year = 2015|isbn = 9781517053857|location = |pages = 184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

1930 - William Harris moved to the town of [[Geraldton]] where he died on 13 July 1931 and is buried in the Aboriginal cemetery at Utacarra, Geraldton.

The Aborigines Act 1905, continued to govern the lives of all Aboriginal people in Western Australia until it was repealed by the Native Welfare Act 1963. Mogumber (Moore River Native Settlement) continued as a segregation facility until 1974.

'''Women for Human Rights''' is an organisation which works to secure the political, social, cultural and economic rights of single women in [[Nepal]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.ekantipur.com/the-kathmandu-post/2013/04/29/related_articles/all-the-single-ladies/248167.html|title = All the single ladies|date = April 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="aboutus"&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://whr.org.np/about-us/#.UwAefEKSyAE |title=Women For Human Rights ( WHR ) &amp;#124; About Us |publisher=WHR |date= |accessdate=2014-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.beinkandescent.com/articles/1632/Women+for+Human+Rights |title=Beyond the Bottom Line: Lily Thapa's Women for Human Rights |publisher=BeInkandescent |date= |accessdate=2014-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ips.org/blog/mdg3/2011/03/nepals-single-women-instigate-much-needed-change/ |title=Nepal`s single women instigate much needed change |publisher=Ips.org |date=2011-03-07 |accessdate=2014-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was founded by [[Lily Thapa]]. It works in 73 [[List of districts of Nepal|districts]] and 1550 [[Village development committee (Nepal)|VDCs]], with over 100,000 single women members.

==Background==
Gender discrimination is the stark and shameful reality of a country facing Nepal, a country that marches on the path of progress and aims to achieve modernity. Violence against women is pervasive and to this day, remains marked with acute poverty, inequality and marginalisation, especially in cases of single women. Research clearly indicates the horrific situation of the women in Nepal, caused by age-old norms of a male-dominated society. According to the 2011 Nepal Demographic Health Survey, 1 in every 5 women between the ages of 15-49, experience domestic violence at least once in their life. Despite the legal age for marriage being 20, 41% women are married before they turn 18. The 2015 Constitution of Nepal has established equal right to property for spouses, thereby prohibiting gender discrimination. The Civil Code of Nepal however, limits the rights of inheritance of unmarried daughters, as it is automatically assumed that once married, they will have access to property through their husband. 

==About==
Women in Nepal are subject to heavy discrimination in various aspects of everyday life. Be it cultural or local traditions, or even certain laws and policies; women must face all manner of stigma-driven roadblocks. The situation of the widows (single women) is far worse, as they are unjustly persecuted and marginalized by the pervasive outlook of society. There also exist in prevalence, certain religious and traditional practices, in Nepal, which are detrimentally harmful for the physical and mental health of the women upon whom they are inflicted.
WHR was founded with the basic objective of encouraging single women to step out of the confines of their homes and share their sorrows, woes, fears and frustrations with counselors, as well as other women with similar problems. Initially, said sharing opportunities were provided at monthly forums, where experts from various developmental fields were invited to share their respective knowledge and experiences with the group. These sessions proved quite fruitful, as single women found solace and relief by sharing their problems with others, thus realizing a wonderfully conducive group atmosphere. After two years of such informal group meetings, WHR was finally registered as a formal organization in 1994. WHR defines ‘Widows’ as “Single women’, a change in terminology that has been put into force since the word ‘Widow’ is viewed with much disdain in Nepali society, thus inflicting a lot of humiliation and agony upon the women. Ever since its inception, WHR has strives to create an active, interconnected and dedicated network of single women, at both national as well as international level. Today, over 20 years later, WHR works in 74 districts and 1550 VDC’s (Village Development Committee). WHR has over 100,000 single woman members as well as 2000 single-women offshoot groups. 

==Objectives&lt;ref name="aboutus"/&gt;==
The WHR work model functions within the framework of certain basic objectives. These are specifically designed to encompass broadly, all the major and minor endeavors of the organisation. The objectives are:
*To raise the socio-cultural, legal, political and economic status of Nepalese women as well as their families. 
*To mainstream the rights of single women in development, humanitarian and peace-building initiatives. 
*To lobby and advocate for meaningful participation of single women at decision-making levels in the social, economic and political spheres. 
*To enhance the capabilities and confidence of single women, and to enable them in their journey toward becoming agents of change and progress themselves. 

==WHR Work Model==
WHR works primarily with single women; inclusive of widows, wives of missing husbands, divorcees, unmarried women of 35 years age and above, as well as women separated yet not divorced from their husbands. WHR has developed various unique methods to give a strong voice to single women, so as to bring together widows of all categories from all sides of the conflict, to a level platform that is free from the shadows of caste, ethnicity or political background. WHR employs a well-structured strategic approach in order to ensure maximum effectiveness with which objectives are achieved. 
The basic strategic work model of WHR envisages changing of traditional stereotypes and mind-sets that bar widows from participating and accessing resources. In addition to this, WHR also aims to change policies that are discriminatory against widows and provide them with their basic rights. The basic end to this is to bring about a widespread societal realization that widows make for valuable social capital. WHR’s strategic plan focusses on five framework pillars: 
*Pillar 1 (Socio-cultural Empowerment and Movement)
The key intention of this pillar is to help build a more tolerant society as a whole. It focusses mainly on socio-cultural aspects of single women and creates awareness, both amongst victims of cultural torture and perpetrators of such torture. 

*Pillar 2 (Economic Empowerment and Mobilization)
The major goal of this movement is the empowerment of single women, so that they form groups and networks, thus becoming actively engaged in income generation and the subsequent enhancement of their respective livelihood capacities. 

*Pillar 3 (Justice, Human Rights and Peace)
This program involves using a strong advocacy campaign (and lobbying) for appropriate regulatory framework to address human rights issues, enhance the capacity of single women groups and networks in peace building and transitional justice systems. 

*Pillar 4 (Local Governance) 
Through its de-centralizing approach, WHR enables single women groups and networks to articulate demands, improve their situation, secure rights from local bodies and service providers; the end goal being the transformation of said groups into self-governing institutions. 

==The Nepal Earthquake of 2015 and Relief Effort by WHR==
On April 25, 2015, Nepal was struck by a 7.6 magnitude earthquake, with an equally powerful subsequent aftershock on May 12. The pre-existing gender inequality in Nepal was only further accelerated by this calamity, and it comes as no surprise that women in particular, suffered the most in its aftermath. Over 87,000 people lost their lives, half of whom were women. Furthermore, 23,500 people were injured with over 8 million people being affected across 31 districts, 53% being women. Over 850,000 houses were either destroyed or damaged, 26% of which belonged to women heads-of-households. Also, health facilities covering 1.4 million women (including girls of reproductive age) were drastically affected, 93,000 among whom were pregnant. The earthquake destroyed scores of houses, which left 92% of the women and their families under tents and tarpaulins. Research also suggests that 24.4% women in Kathmandu had lost their property papers, with as many as 49% women losing their citizenship certificates; with the replacement of such crucial documents being slow and scattered. Drinking water facilities also took a sizeable hit from the earthquake, making the situation even direr for the women, many of whom had to travel half an hour or more and que up for hours on end, for just a few litres of water. The bad water situation was superseded only by the damage to sanitation facilities, with 43% women reporting much damage to their toilets. Hygiene was a matter of high concern, with only 23% women having received appropriate hygiene kits, leaving 60% women in dearth. 
===Relief Effort===
WHR conducted a rapid assessment survey of the earthquake-affected areas in order to identify the immediate community needs, status of environmental sanitation and other vital factors pertaining to subsequent relief effort. In collaboration with CARE Nepal, WHR initiated and implemented the Nepal Earthquake Response at Gorkha; the aim of which was to sensitize and enhance the responsive capabilities of earthquake affected communities. The collaboration, which began on May 1, 2015, also incorporated the active assistance 5 working VDC’s of Gorkha; namely Mirkot, Khoplang, Dhuwakot, Saurpani and Chhoprak. The Youth Wing of WHR was also actively involved in the relief work, taking control of the volatile situation, playing a major part in the various relief and aid teams. The extensive work done by the 7 teams (Procurement, Assembling, Packing, Fund raising, Photography, Social media and Distribution) in the regions of Gorkha, Dhading, Nuwakot, Sindhupalchowk, Kathmandu, Bhaktapur and Lalitpur, was paramount in creating an efficient line of assistance for the victims. 

==Major initiatives and programs==
===Opportunity Fund===
The Opportunity Fund has been created as a solution to the problems faced by single women and their children, by providing them with scholarships for education through formal as well as non-formal channels. This scholarship program is purposed at the upliftment of the children of single women who are at the risk of discrimination and violence. So far, the Opportunity Fund has successfully provided scholarships for over 1000 children, as well as to many women willing to pursue their higher studies. The Fund also helps remedy the socio-economic situation of many girl-children, by assisting them with their formal and informal education. The Fund has also supported the formation of “Sachetana” Youth Club, whose primary goal is raising public awareness regarding issues of single women in Nepal. 
===Aadhar-Credit saving program===
Aadhar, which means ‘Support’ in Nepali, is basically a collateral-free micro-credit program that provides loans with low interest to single women. Aadhar is a crucial aspect of single women empowerment, as initiated by WHR, and it encourages more of single women entrepreneurs by serving as a backbone for small businesses. Aadhar caters to all women who are registered members (fitting criteria) of WHR, the priority however, being given to single women. The Aadhar program has been instrumental in changing the lives of numerous single women, who have been able to shed the coils of insufficiency and successfully started small-scale businesses, thus attaining economic independence. Overall, the Program has greatly raised the self-confidence and level of independence of single women; as many of them are now involved in self-sustaining activities like livestock-farming, agro-farming, mushroom growing, catering, grocery and tailoring shops, cart shops, among many others. 
===Single Women Entrepreneurs Group (SWEG)===
The SWEG program is a vital organ of the Aadhar credit program, since its key goal is to provide single women with skill development training for various income-generating activities. The mode of operation employed by SWEG involves harnessing the skills and experiences of single women who are excluded from the mainstream job market, and developing those skills in innovative ways, thus creating employment opportunity in a conducive work environment. What began initially as a small business known as “Single Women Corner”, has now expanded its horizons in aiding hundreds of single women to become empowered. All of the skills/services taught in SWEG training have been mentioned in the above (Aadhar). A simultaneous accomplishment is the production and promotion of Nepalese handicrafts, the craft of which is taught as one of the courses under SWEG. Women from rural areas also produce indigenous handicrafts using the limited resources available that are made to order. Other like items include household, individual officially purposed items; as well as catering to hospitals and various other religious/cultural ceremonies. Apart from these, SWEG also conducts a full-scale catering service. 
===Chhahari-Safe Spaces===
The meaning of Chhahari in Nepalese is literally, Safe Space, and the initiative provides a shade of solidarity to the single women. Chhahari spaces are created for vulnerable single women affected by conflict/disaster, and administers various skill development courses as well as counselling; all with the objective of raising the self-confidence and independence of single women, thus enabling them to reintegrate with dignity, in a society that they were once ostracized by. WHR regards women as vital elements of change, both in the process of societal as well as infrastructural development. Due to a lack of proper provision for the protection or service opportunity for single women, thousands of women are displaced and forced to work in the informal sector. Such circumstances have prompted WHR to develop Chhahari ‘safe spaces’, where women from all backgrounds and societal classes have a level ground upon which to nurture their skills and become self-sufficient. Chhahari also provides shelter for single women with small children and in need of temporary shelter. Each Chhahari shelter is equipped with 4 basic sections, namely: Healing Centre, Resource/Administrative Sector, Community Learning Centre and Economic Opportunity Centre. The purpose of this to ensure proper counselling, skill-developmental, child-friendly environment; that maintains an up-to-date database on all those it seeking its assistance.

===Raahat===
Raahat, meaning ‘Relief’, is purposed at the empowerment and rehabilitation of CAW (Conflict Affected Women) and their children, from traumatic experiences; all of which is done by provision of various services such as psycho-social counselling, legal aid, scholarships, skill development and micro-credit loan schemes. For its legal provision, Raahat has developed a lucid Legal Booklet, containing vital legal information on provisions for conflict-affected individuals. For its most important function, Raahat maintains effective communication between the concerned Ministries of Nepal Government and CAW, regarding important matters like compensation, pension etc. Other bodies that Raahat is in constant network with are: Gender and Transitional Justice in Nepal organized by OHCHR, ICTJ as well as the Advocacy Forum. Other local NGO’s are also kept in the loop of activities, so as to facilitate exchange of information on justice for CAW during the transitional phase in the development of Nepal. 
*Legal Toolkit
Raahat has developed a lucid and detailed legal toolkit containing useful information regarding CAW, government initiatives for them, as well as vital data on transitional justice. The document also includes a list of international organisations that provide support and counselling for women, especially CAW. The self-help aspect of the toolkit includes measures to be taken in case of violence, national and international mechanisms regarding justice in such situations. 
*Nispakchya
The decade-long conflict that pervaded Nepal led to numerous violations of different rights as well as laws. Many of said violations took place in the case of women, and Nispakchya was established as a result, in the year 2014, in order to safeguard the integrity of and provide justice for, CAW. Being a common platform for women who had been victimized during the armed conflict, the initiative deals with the issues of these women and circulates information to the concerned stakeholders. The network of Nispakchya is spread over 10 districts in Nepal, with the end objective of encompassing the entire country. 
===RED Color Movement===
The color red symbolizes womanhood and is the color presented to every young girl when she comes of age. But these very colors are torn away from her when a woman becomes a widow. Her ornaments are broken, her 'sindhood' is wiped away and she is forced to wear white for the remainder of her days. After the death of the husband a woman is labeled and marked as an outcast because of which, the white sarees that are forced upon her, which also serves as an apt metaphor for the dry and hard lives single women lead. The philosophy of the red color movement was this: the single women in the country should not be distinguishable from the rest just because of the color they wear. Several women stood in solidarity with this movement as a sign that it was time to do away with these social malpractices and to bring equality to all single women. The movement was the very personification of the WHR motto: No discrimination on the basis of marital status.  
250 Young Single Women and 6 Elderly Single Women broke the social stigma and rallied for ‘Red Movement’ in Rupendehi. The Red Movement had been initiated by WHR since 2002 in Dhading. The Program was initiated with a rally which was later followed by felicitating single women with red colored bangles and vermilion. A major tool employed by this ground-breaking movement, was the Red Tika Challenge.
====Red Tika Challenge====
The red tika challenge was an online campaign aimed to raise awareness on gender inequality and the plight of widows in the country. The challenge asked people to post a picture with the color red and share it on social media and then further challenge more people to stand in solidarity with single woman by posting pictures of their own. The movement gained a lot of momentum and went viral on Facebook with more than 60,000 youths taking up the challenge as well as several public figures.  
“The colour red symbolizes passion and life so our culture prohibits widows from wearing anything red. Women are forced to wear only white attire, which I believe takes a toll on their beauty. So, the main aim of this campaign is to change that mentality,” says Lily Thapa, founder of WHR Nepal, who herself kick started the challenge with #redtikachallenge.
“The campaign wants to drive home the message that the marital status of a woman should not decide which color she can or cannot wear, emphasizes Lily. The movement aimed to break age old notions and successfully managed to reach and involve the younger generation. “Colour is purely a woman’s choice. Society shouldn’t dictate it.” Said Lilly. 

==Major changes made in legislation==
Despite legislative ratification at various levels, single women are constantly denied their basic social, political and economic rights. Their crucial roles in society as agents of change, peace-builders and sole supporters of their respective families, are hardly given adequate recognition. For a number of years now, WHR has constantly been lobbying and raising awareness regarding the dire situation of widows (single women) in the country, and as a result, has been successful in changing 6 major discriminatory laws against single women in Nepal:

===Work done for Vaikalyas (Child/Under-age Widows)===
The condition of Vaikalyas in Nepal are said to be even worse than that of the adult widows, with customs, practices and codes of conduct being far more stringent and suffocating. The child widows are the unfortunate recipients of heavy contempt and are ostracized as outcasts. They are labeled as 'cursed' and are blamed for the death of their husband. WHR, along with Pro Public, filed a petition for the rights of Vaikalyas in 2009. After 3 years of heavy demonstration and lobbying, the Supreme Court officially declared these traditions as ill-practices in 2012. The Supreme Court also directed the Ministry of Women, Children and Social Welfare to establish a working committee, purposed specifically at the permanent elimination of any such practice.
