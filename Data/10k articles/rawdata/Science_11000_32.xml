'''A2261-BCG''' (short for '''Abell 2261 Brightest Cluster Galaxy''') is a huge elliptical galaxy in the cluster [[Abell 2261]]. One of the [[List of largest galaxies|largest galaxies known]], A2261-BCG is estimated to have a diameter of a million light-years, some 10 times larger than the [[Milky Way]]. It is the brightest and the most massive galaxy in the cluster, and has the largest galactic core ever observed, spanning more than 10,000 light-years.&lt;ref name="NASA"&gt;{{cite web

The [[type-cD galaxy|cD elliptical]] galaxy, located at least 3 billion light-years from Earth, is also well known as a radio source.&lt;ref name="SIMBAD"/&gt; Its core is highly populated by a dense number of old stars, but is mysteriously diffuse, giving it a large core.
On September 10, 2012, using [[Hubble Space Telescope]]'s Wide Field Camera 3, scientists found out that there was no supermassive black hole present in the center.&lt;ref name="NASA" /&gt; This may be the likely cause of its diffuse and large core, but it contradicts modern galactic evolutionary theories.  A huge cD galaxy like A2261-BCG would be expected to have a supermassive black hole concentrated at its center.

An '''acceptance credit''' is a type of [[letter of credit]] that is paid by a time [[cheque|draft]] authorizing payment on or after a specific date, if the terms of the letter of credit have been complied with.  There are two types of acceptance credit, confirmed and unconfirmed.  Unconfirmed acceptance credit means that the seller takes the risk that payment will not be made, due to any number of contingencies such as shipment non-delivery, confiscation by customs authorities, or any other problems.  Confirmed acceptance credit means that the bank upon which the credit has been issued, essentially guarantees payment as long as the terms of the letter of credit have been complied with.

Confirmed acceptance credit is more expensive to establish than unconfirmed acceptance credit because the issuing bank is effectively guaranteeing payment.  It also transfers the risk of non-delivery to the recipient, because once the seller [[Free on board|places the product in the hands of the shipping company]], the seller has complied and will be paid; if the shipment does not arrive, is delayed, or other problems occur, the buyer cannot stop payment or otherwise prevent redemption of the acceptance credit.

Banks may also create an acceptance credit facility allowing a company to issue time drafts not linked to specific shipments in order to provide general working capital finance. Under the arrangement the issuing company presents bills of exchange to the bank for acceptance, confirmation and sale at a discount to face value (representing the finance cost until maturity). The discounted sum is made available to the issuing company until the bill's maturity when it is obliged to repay the bill's full face value to the bank. The process may then be repeated to provide a so-called rolling facility. While popular in the pre-electronic era, such facilities have since been widely replaced by financing arrangements which do not require the issue of paper.

'''Ahi Pepe MothNet''' (styled ''Ahi Pepe | MothNet'') is a citizen science initiative based in [[Otago]], [[New Zealand]] and led by [[Landcare Research|Manaaki Whenua Landcare Research]] that aims to raise the awareness of moths among teachers and students.

== Name ==
Ahi Pepe ([[Māori language|Māori]] for ''moth fire'') refers a traditional proverb (whakataukī) of [[Te Whiti o Rongomai]] about firelight attracting moths (pepe) instead of [[Muttonbirding|muttonbirds]] (tītī).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.curiousminds.nz/projects/ahi-pepe-mothnet-aotearoa/|title=Ahi Pepe MothNet – Aotearoa - Curious Minds, He Hihiri i te Mahara|date=2017-05-12|work=Curious Minds, He Hihiri i te Mahara|access-date=2018-02-14|language=en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Activities ==
Ahi Pepe began in 2015 as a project with four [[Otago]] schools, and continued with finding from [[Landcare Research]], Unlocking Curious Minds,&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and the Biological Heritage National Science Challenge.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/information-for/citizen-science/mothnet/about|title=About Ahi Pepe {{!}} MothNet|website=www.landcareresearch.co.nz|language=en|access-date=2018-02-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Collaborators include [[Otago Museum]], [[Orokonui Ecosanctuary]], the [[University of Otago]], [[Ngāi Tahu|Te Rūnanga o Ngāi Tahu]], and schools across the [[South Island]].

In October 2016, Ahi Pepe worked with Orokonui Ecosanctuary to install moth traps inside and outside the predator-proof fence, and schoolchildren worked alongside entomologists to pin and identify the moths caught.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.odt.co.nz/lifestyle/magazine/whisper-moths|title=A whisper of moths|last=Anderson|first=Barbara|date=3 April 2017|work=Otago Daily Times|access-date=2018-02-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The project has produced educational resources for schools in both English and [[Māori language|Te Reo Māori]]. The South Island guide is the first educational resource to be written in the [[Ngāi Tahu|Kāi Tahu]] dialect.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://gazette.education.govt.nz/articles/embracing-our-cultural-richness-ahi-pepe-mothnet-project/|title=Embracing our cultural richness: Ahi Pepe {{!}} MothNet project {{!}} Education Gazette - Education in New Zealand|last=New Zealand Ministry of Education|first=|date=26 October 2017|work=Education Gazette|access-date=2018-02-14|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|language=en-NZ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017, public donations enabled a delegation of Otago schoolchildren to give a presentation on Ahi Pepe at the World Indigenous Peoples Conference on Education in [[Toronto]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

'''''An Urchin in the Storm''''' is a 1987 essay collection from [[paleontology|paleontologist]] and science writer [[Stephen Jay Gould]].

==Overview==
All but one of the essays had originally appeared in ''[[The New York Review of Books]]''. Grouped by theme, the sections of the book deal respectively with the irreducibility of history (and the pleasures and challenges of contingency) in its two principal domains of life and the earth, nature's complexity, the theory and consequences of [[biological determinism]], and rationalism in explanation.  Thus it is philosophically the most important of Gould's works - as befits a book dedicated to Peter Medawar and especially Isaiah Berlin, since the latter shares with Gould a commitment against determinism, even though Gould had a Marxist background while Berlin is quintessentially anti-Marxist.

It was reviewed in ''[[The New York Times]]'' by [[Michiko Kakutani]], who noted that although the pieces were technically book reviews, Gould "tends to use the subject at hand as a jumping-off point for more general discussions". Gould argued against [[Creationism]] and biological determinism, criticizing [[sociobiology]] and [[Arthur Jensen]]'s theories about race and intelligence. Other subjects discussed included the nature of geological time and change, the 19th century Devonian controversy, which involved the identification of a major period of earth history, and the work of biologists [[Barbara McClintock]], [[E. E. Just]], G. E. Hutchinson, and [[Lewis Thomas]].&lt;ref name="NYT"&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/97/11/09/home/gould-urchin.html | title=New York Times Review | accessdate=July 9, 2012 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Army engineering maintenance''' consists of those [[engineers]], [[technicians]], and military organizations responsible for the expert repair and maintenance of [[army]] vehicles,  weapon systems, and other equipment.

Army engineering maintenance should not be confused with [[military engineering]] which is distinctly separate and analogous to [[civil engineering]] while the former analogous to [[mechanical engineering]] and [[electrical engineering]].

== Operational and tactical level focus ==
At the operational and tactical levels, army engineering maintenance is focused on the repair and scheduled maintenance work required to keep army equipment fleets operational.

== Strategic level focus ==
At the strategic level, army engineering maintenance is closely linked to [[military logistics]].  At this level, it includes work such as the design, development, and testing of new vehicles and weapon systems.  It also includes [[Product lifecycle management|lifecycle management]] activities once new systems become operational.

A '''body force''' is a force that acts throughout the volume of a body. Forces due to [[gravity]], [[electrostatics|electric fields]] and [[magnetic fields]] are examples of body forces. Body forces contrast with [[contact force]]s or [[surface force]]s which are exerted to the surface of an object.

[[Normal force]]s and [[shear force]]s between objects are '''surface forces''' as they are exerted to the surface of an object. All [[Cohesion (chemistry)|cohesive]] surface attraction and contact forces between objects are also considered as surface forces.

[[Fictitious forces]] such as the [[centrifugal force]], [[Euler force]], and the [[Coriolis effect]] are also examples of body forces.

==Definition==

===Qualitative===
A body force is simply a type of force, and so it has the same [[dimensional analysis|dimensions]] as [[force]], [M][L][T]&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt;. However, it is often convenient to talk about a body force in terms of either the [[force]] per unit [[volume]] or the force per unit [[mass]]. If the [[force]] per unit [[volume]] is of interest, it is referred to as the [[force density]] throughout the system.

A body force is distinct from a contact force in that the force does not require contact for transmission. Thus, common forces associated with [[pressure gradient]]s and [[conductive]] and [[convective]] heat transmission are not body forces as they require contact between systems to exist. [[Radiation]] heat transfer, on the other hand, is a perfect example of a body force.

More examples of common body forces include;
*[[Gravity]],
*[[Electric force]]s acting on an object charged throughout its volume,
*[[Magnetic force]]s acting on currents within an object, such as the braking force that results from [[eddy currents]],

[[Fictitious force]]s (or inertial forces) can be viewed as body forces. Common inertial forces are,

*[[Centrifugal force]],
*[[Coriolis force]],
*[[Euler force]] (or transverse force), which occurs in a rotating reference frame when the rate of rotation of the frame is changing

However, fictitious forces are not actually forces. Rather they are corrections to [[Newton's second law]] when it is formulated in an [[Non-inertial reference frame|accelerating reference frame]].

===Quantitative===

The body force density is defined so that the [[volume integral]] (throughout a volume of interest) of it gives the total force acting throughout the body;

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{F}_{\mathrm{body}} =  \int\limits_{V} \rho \mathbf{g}(\mathbf{r}) \mathrm{d} V \,,&lt;/math&gt;

where d''V'' is an [[Differential (infinitesimal)|infinitesimal]] [[volume element]], ''&amp;rho;'' is the mass [[density]], and '''g''' is the ''external body force density field'' acting on the system.

==Acceleration==
{{main|Newton's second law}}
Like any other force, a body force will cause an object to [[accelerate]]. For a non-rigid object, [[Newton's second law]] applied to a small volume element is

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{f} (\mathbf{r})=\rho (\mathbf{r})\mathbf{g} (\mathbf{r})&lt;/math&gt;,

where ''ρ''('''r''') is the [[mass density]] of the substance, '''ƒ''' the force density, and '''a'''('''r''') all at point '''r'''.  

In the case of gravity on a planet surface, '''g'''('''r''') is simply the approximately constant and uniform [[gravitational field]], like on Earth where:

:&lt;math&gt;g = 9.81 \frac{\mathrm m}{\mathrm s^2}&lt;/math&gt;

'''Body hair''', or '''androgenic hair''', is the [[terminal hair]] that develops on the [[human body]] during and after [[puberty]]. It is differentiated from the [[head hair]] and less visible [[vellus hair]], which are much finer and lighter in color. The growth of androgenic hair is related to the level of [[androgen]]s (often referred to as male [[hormone]]s) and the density of androgen receptors in the dermal papillae. Both must reach a threshold for the proliferation of hair follicle cells.

From childhood onward, regardless of [[sex]], vellus hair covers almost the entire area of the [[human body]]. Exceptions exclude the lips; the backs of the ears; the palms of hands; the soles of the feet; certain external [[Sex organ|genital]] areas; the [[navel]]; and [[scar]] tissue. The density of hair –&amp;nbsp;i.e. the number of [[hair follicle]]s per unit area of skin&amp;nbsp;– varies from person to person. In many cases, areas on the human body that contain vellus hair will begin to produce darker and thicker body hair, such as the first growth of [[Beard|beard hair]] on a male and female [[Adolescence|adolescent]]'s previously smooth chin; although it may appear thinner on the female.

Androgenic hair follows the same [[Human hair growth|growth pattern]] as the hair that grows on the scalp, but with a shorter [[Hair follicle#Anagen phase|anagen phase]] and longer [[Hair follicle#Telogen phase|telogen phase]].  While the anagen phase for the hair on one's head lasts for years, the androgenic hair growth phase for body hair lasts a few months. The telogen phase for body hair lasts close to a year.{{Citation needed|reason=Original source unavailabl or removed|date=May 2018}} This shortened growing period and extended dormant period explains why the hair on the head tends to be much longer than other hair found on the body.  Differences in length seen in comparing the hair on the back of the hand and pubic hair, for example, can be explained by varied growth cycles in those two regions.  The same goes for differences in body hair length seen in different people, especially when comparing [[men]] and [[women]].

==Distribution==
Like much of the hair on the human body, leg, arm, chest, and back hair begin as vellus hair.  As people age, the hair in these regions will often begin to grow darker and more abundantly.  This will typically happen during or after puberty.  Men will often have more abundant, coarser hair on the arms and back, while women tend to have a less drastic change in the hair growth in these areas but do experience a significant change in thickness of hairs.  However, some women will grow darker, longer hair in one or more of these regions.

=== Chest and abdomen ===
Vellus hair grows on the chest and abdomen of both sexes at all stages of development.  After puberty and extending into adulthood, most males grow increasing amounts of terminal hair over the chest and abdomen areas.  Adult women also typically can grow terminal hairs around the [[areola]] though in many cultures these hairs are typically removed.{{citation needed|date=December 2016}}
[[File:Arm hair.jpg|thumb|Arm hair]]

=== Arms ===
Arm hair grows on a human's [[forearms]], sometimes even on the elbow area. Terminal arm hair is concentrated on the wrist end of the forearm, extending over the [[hand]]. Terminal hair growth in adolescent males is often much more intense than that in females, particularly for individuals with dark hair. In some cultures, it is common for women to remove arm hair, though this practice is less frequent than that of leg hair removal.

Terminal hair growth on [[arm]]s is a secondary sexual characteristic in boys and appears in the last stages of puberty.  Vellus arm hair is usually concentrated on the elbow end of the forearm and often ends on the lower part of the [[upper arm]]. This type of intense arm vellus hair growth sometimes occurs in young women and people of both sexes until puberty. Even though this causes the arms to appear hairy, it is not caused solely by testosterone. The hair is softer and different from men's arm hair, in texture.

=== Feet ===
Visible hair appearing on the top surfaces of the feet and [[toes]] generally begins with the onset of puberty. Terminal hair growth on the feet is typically more intense in adult and adolescent males than in females.

=== Legs ===
[[File:Adolescent leg hair.jpg|thumb|Leg hair of an adolescent male]]
Leg hair sometimes appears at the onset of adulthood, with the legs of men more often hairier than those of women. For a variety of reasons, people may [[leg shaving|shave their leg hair]], including cultural practice or individual needs. Around the world, women generally shave their leg hair more regularly than men, to conform with the social norms of many cultures, many of which perceive smooth skin as a sign of youth, beauty, and in some cultures, hygiene. However, athletes of both sexes – [[Swimming (sport)|swimmers]], [[track and field|runners]], [[bicycling|cyclists]] and [[bodybuilding|bodybuilders]] in particular – may shave their androgenic hair to reduce friction, highlight muscular development or to make it easier to get into and out of skin-tight clothing.

===Pubic===
[[Pubic hair]] is a collection of coarse hair found in the pubic region. It will often also grow on the thighs and abdomen. Zoologist [[Desmond Morris]] disputes theories that it developed to signal sexual maturity or protect the skin from chafing during copulation, and prefers the explanation that pubic hair acts as a scent trap. Also, both sexes having thick pubic hairs act as a sort of cushion during intercourse.&lt;ref name="morris-bodywatching"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Morris|first=Desmond|title=Bodywatching: a field guide to the human species|year=1985|publisher=Jonathan Cape|location=London|page=209}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[genital]] area of males and females are first inhabited by shorter, lighter vellus hairs that are next to invisible and only begin to develop into darker, thicker pubic hair at [[puberty]]. At this time, the [[pituitary gland]] secretes [[gonadotropin]] hormones which trigger the production of testosterone in the testicles and ovaries, promoting pubic hair growth. The average ages pubic hair begins to grow in males and females are 12 and 11, respectively. However, in some females, pubic hair has been known to start growing as early as age 7.

Just as individual people differ in scalp hair color, they can also differ in pubic hair color. Differences in thickness, growth rate, and length are also evident.

[[Islamic hygienical jurisprudence]] teaches that pubic and armpit hair must be pulled out or shaven to be considered as [[Sunnah]]. Trimming is acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=53EPNr8qeLgC&amp;pg=PA169&amp;dq=Pubic+and+armpit+hair+must+also+be+shaven.+islam&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ4fuB-7fLAhVQUI4KHbjtBVMQ6AEIGzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Pubic%20and%20armpit%20hair%20must%20also%20be%20shaven.%20islam&amp;f=false | title=Living in the Shade of Islam: A Comprehensive Reference of Theory and Practice | publisher=Tughra Books | date=2003 | last=Ismail |first=Buyukcelebi | pages=169 | isbn=1-932-09921-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Western culture, beginning in the 1980s, there has been a trend among women to remove or trim pubic hair, either partially or completely; the trend later spread to men as well. Fashions for both men and women to either shape or remove pubic hair rise and fall throughout much of history, though it is more often considered as a practice for women alone.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Looking Through the Bushes: The Disappearance of Pubic Hair|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/roger-friedland/women-pubic-hair_b_875465.html | work=Huffington Post | first=Roger|last=Friedland}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Armpits===

Underarm hair normally starts to appear at the [[pubarche|beginning]] of [[puberty]], with growth usually completed by the end of the teenage years.

Today in much of the world, it is common for women to regularly [[Shaving|shave]] their underarm hair. The prevalence of this practice varies widely, though. The practice became popular for cosmetic reasons around 1915 in the [[United States]] and [[United Kingdom]], when one or more magazines showed a woman in a dress with shaved underarms. As women's armpit hair contrasts more noticeably with her other body hair than does a man's, it is a significant indicator of sexual maturity and therefore unwelcome in conventional western polite society. Regular shaving became feasible with the introduction of the [[safety razor]] at the beginning of the 20th century. While underarm shaving was quickly adopted in some [[English language|English]] speaking countries, especially in the US and [[Canada]], it did not become widespread in [[Europe]] until well after [[World War II]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hope|first=Christine|year=1982|title=Caucasian Female Body Hair and American Culture|journal=Journal of American Culture|volume=5|issue=1|pages=93–99|doi=10.1111/j.1542-734X.1982.0501_93.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.straightdope.com/columns/read/625/who-decided-women-should-shave-their-legs-and-underarms |title=Who decided women should shave their legs and underarms? |last1=Adams |first1=Cecil |date=1991-02-06 |website=[[The Straight Dope]] |accessdate=2015-01-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since then the practice has spread worldwide. Some men also choose to shave their armpits.

===Facial===

[[Facial hair]], as the name suggests, grows primarily on or around one's [[face]]. Both men and women experience facial hair growth. Like pubic hair, non-vellus facial hair will begin to grow in around puberty. [[Moustache]]s in young men usually begin to grow in at around the age of puberty, although some men may not grow a moustache until they reach late teens or at all. For some cases facial hair development may take longer to mature than in the late teens but a lot of men experience no facial development even at an older age. Facial hair development has often been associated with stress levels.

It is common for many women to develop a few facial hairs under or around the chin, along the sides of the face (in the area of sideburns), or on the upper lip. These may appear at any age after puberty but are often seen in women after [[menopause]] due to decreased levels of estrogen. A darkening of the vellus hair of the upper lip in women is not considered true facial hair, though it is often referred to as a "moustache"; the appearance of these dark vellus hairs may be lessened by bleaching. A relatively small number of women are able to grow enough facial hair to have a distinct beard. In some cases, female beard growth is the result of a hormonal imbalance (usually [[androgen]] excess), or a rare genetic disorder known as [[hypertrichosis]].&lt;ref name="congenitallanuginosa"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/1072987-overview |title= Congenital Hypertrichosis Lanuginosa|last1= Taylor|first1= Sarah K |date= June 18, 2009 |work= Emedicine|publisher= Medscape |accessdate=December 4, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sometimes it is caused by use of [[anabolic steroid]]s. Cultural pressure leads most women to remove facial hair, as it may be viewed as a [[social stigma]].

== Development==
{{Main|Human hair growth}}

Hair follicles are to varying degrees sensitive to androgen, primarily [[testosterone]] and its derivatives, particularly [[dihydrotestosterone]], with different areas on the body having different sensitivity. As androgen levels increase, the rate of hair growth and the weight of the hairs increase. Genetic factors determine both individual levels of androgen and the hair follicle's sensitivity to androgen, as well as other characteristics such as hair colour, type of hair and hair retention.

Rising levels of androgen during puberty cause vellus hair to transform into terminal hair over many areas of the body. The sequence of appearance of terminal hair reflects the level of androgen sensitivity, with [[pubic hair]] being the first to appear due to the area's special sensitivity to androgen. The appearance of pubic hair in both sexes is usually seen as an indication of the start of a person's puberty. There is a [[sexual differentiation]] in the amount and distribution of androgenic hair, with men tending to have more terminal hair in more areas. This includes [[facial hair]], [[chest hair]], [[abdominal hair]], [[leg hair]], [[arm hair]], and [[foot hair]]. Women retain more of the less visible vellus hair, although leg, arm, and foot hair can be noticeable on women.  It is not unusual for women to have a few terminal hairs around their nipples as well.
In the later decades of life, especially after the 5th decade, there begins a noticeable reduction in body hair especially in the legs.  The reason for this is not known but it could be due to poorer circulation, lower free circulating hormone amounts or other reasons.

==Function==

Androgenic hair provides tactile sensory input by transferring hair movement and vibration via the shaft to sensory nerves within the skin. Follicular nerves detect displacement of hair shafts and other nerve endings in the surrounding skin detect vibration and distortions of the skin around the follicles. Androgenic hair extends the sense of touch beyond the surface of the skin into the air and space surrounding it, detecting air movements as well as hair displacement from contact by insects or objects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Controlled Stimulation of Hair Follicle Receptors |url=http://jap.physiology.org/cgi/reprint/36/2/256.pdf |author=N. H. Sabah |journal=Journal of Applied Physiology |date=1 February 1974 |volume=36 |number=2 |pages=256–257}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://faculty.washington.edu/chudler/receptor.html |title=Neuroscience for Kids – Receptors |publisher=Faculty.washington.edu |date= |accessdate=28 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Evolution ==
Determining the evolutionary function of androgenic hair must take into account both [[human evolution]] and the thermal properties of hair itself.

The thermodynamic properties of hair are based on the properties of the [[keratin]] strands and [[amino acids]] that combine into a 'coiled' structure. This structure lends to many of the properties of hair, such as its ability to stretch and return to its original length. This coiled structure does not predispose curly or frizzy hair, both of which are defined by oval or triangular hair follicle cross-sections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hair-science.com/_int/_en/topic/topic_sousrub.aspx?tc=ROOT-HAIR-SCIENCE%5EAMAZINGLY-NATURAL%5ESHAPE-WORKSHOP&amp;cur=SHAPE-WORKSHOP |title=Hair Shape |publisher=Hair-science.com |date=1 February 2005 |accessdate=18 September 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081222082300/http://www.hair-science.com/_int/_en/topic/topic_sousrub.aspx?tc=ROOT-HAIR-SCIENCE%5EAMAZINGLY-NATURAL%5ESHAPE-WORKSHOP&amp;cur=SHAPE-WORKSHOP |archivedate=22 December 2008 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Evolution of less body hair===
Hair is a very good thermal conductor and aids heat transfer both into and out of the body. When [[goose bumps]] are observed, small muscles ([[Arrector pili muscle]]) contract to raise the hairs both to provide insulation, by reducing cooling by air convection of the skin, as well as in response to central nervous stimulus, similar to the feeling of 'hairs standing up on the back of your neck'. This phenomenon also occurs when static charge is built up and stored in the hair. Keratin however can easily be damaged by excessive heat and dryness, suggesting that extreme sun exposure, perhaps due to a lack of clothing, would result in perpetual hair destruction, eventually resulting in the genes being bred out in favor of high skin [[pigmentation]]. It is also true that parasites can live on and in hair thus peoples who preserved their body hair would have required greater general hygiene to prevent diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hair-science.com/_int/_en/topic/topic_sousrub.aspx?tc=ROOT-HAIR-SCIENCE^SO-STURDY-SO-FRAGILE^PROPERTIES-OF-HAIR^STRONG-HAIR&amp;cur=STRONG-HAIR |title=Properties Of Hair |publisher=Hair-science.com |date=1 February 2005 |accessdate=18 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Markus J. Rantala of the Department of Biological and Environmental Science, [[University of Jyväskylä]], [[Finland]], said humans evolved by "natural selection" to be hairless when the trade off of "having fewer parasites" became more important than having a "warming, furry coat".&lt;ref name="Rantala" /&gt;

P.E. Wheeler of the Department of Biology at [[Liverpool Polytechnic]] said [[Quadrupedalism|quadrupedal]] [[savannah]] [[mammal]]s of similar volume to humans have body hair to keep warm while only larger quadrupedal savannah mammals lack body hair, because their body volume itself is enough to keep them warm.&lt;ref name="Wheeler" /&gt; Therefore, Wheeler said humans who should have body hair based on predictions of body volume alone for savannah mammals evolved no body hair after evolving [[bipedalism]] which he said reduced the amount of body area exposed to the sun by 40%, reducing the solar warming effect on the human body.&lt;ref name="Wheeler"&gt;Wheeler, P.E. (1985). The Loss of Functional Body Hair in Man: the Influence of Thermal Environment, Body Form and Bipedality. Journal of Human Evolution. 14, 23–28&lt;/ref&gt;

Loss of fur occurred at least 2 million years ago, but possibly as early as 3.3 million years ago judging from the divergence of head and pubic lice, and aided [[persistence hunting]] (the ability to catch prey in very long distance chases) in the warm savannas where hominins first evolved.  The two main advantages are felt to be bipedal locomotion and greater thermal load dissipation capacity due to better sweating and less hair.&lt;ref&gt;Kittler R, Kayser M, Stoneking M: Molecular evolution of Pediculus humanus and the origin of clothing.

===Sexual selection===
{{Main|sexual selection}}

Markus J. Rantala of the Department of Biological and Environmental Science, [[University of Jyväskylä]], [[Finland]], said the existence of [[androgen]] dependent hair on men could be explained by [[sexual attraction]] whereby hair on the genitals would trap [[pheromones]] and hair on the chin would make the chin appear more massive.&lt;ref name="Rantala"&gt;Rantala, M.J.

In 1876,&lt;!--The book's date is 1876.--&gt; [[Oscar Peschel]] wrote that North Asiatic Mongols, Native Americans,&lt;!--Peschel used the ambiguous term "Americans" in his listing of peoples with little to no body hair, but Peschel's usage of the term "Americans" is in reference to Native Americans. Peschel's meaning of the term "Americans" is shown in a different part of the book from the context of the first sentence of the second paragraph of page 403 when Peschel said, "Those writers who separate the Americans as a peculiar race fail to give them distinctive characters, common to them all, which distinguish them from Asiatic Mongols."--&gt; Malays, Hottentots and Bushmen have little to no body hair,&lt;!--In the second sentence of the second paragraph of page 96, Peschel said, "Its scantiness or entire absence in North Asiatic Mongols, in American and Malay families, as well as in Hottentots and Bushmen, afford some of the most persistent and best authenticated racial characters, only it must be added that the natural baldness of the body is artificially exaggerated by the careful extraction of single hairs."--&gt; while Semitics, Indo-Europeans, and Southern Europeans (especially the Portuguese and Spanish) have extensive body hair.&lt;!--In the third and fourth sentences of the first paragraph of page 97, Peschel said, "A luxuriant growth of hair on the body is one of the distinctive marks of the Semitic as well as of the Indo-European families. In Southern Europeans, especially in Portuguese and Spaniards, this character is most strongly developed."--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Peschel, O. (1876). The Races of Man and Their Geographical Distribution.

According to [[Ashley Montagu]] who taught anthropology at Princeton University,  [[Asian people]] and [[black people]] such as the [[San people]]  are less hairy than [[white people]].

Valerie Anne Randall of the Department of Biomedical Sciences, [[University of Bradford]], said beard growth in Caucasian men increases until the mid-thirties due to a delay caused by growth cycles changing from [[vellus hair]] to [[terminal hair]].&lt;ref name="Randal" /&gt; Randall said white men and women are hairier than Japanese men and women even with the same total plasma [[androgen]] levels.&lt;ref name="Randal" /&gt; Randall says that the reason for some people being hairy and some people not being hairy is unclear, but that it probably is related to differing sensitivity of [[hair follicle]]s to [[5α-reductase]].&lt;ref name="Randal"&gt;Randall, V.

Stewart W. Hindley and Albert Damon of the Department of Anthropology at [[Stanford University]] have studied the frequency of hair on the middle finger joint (mid-[[phalanges|phalangeal]] hair) of [[Solomon Island]]ers, as a part of a series of [[anthropometric]] studies of these populations. They summarize other studies on prevalence of this trait as reporting, in general, that  [[Caucasoid]]s are more likely to have hair on the middle finger joint than [[Negroid]]s and [[Mongoloid]]s, and collect the following frequencies from previously published literature: [[Andamanese]] 0%, [[Eskimo]] 1%, African American 16% or 28%, [[Ethiopian people|Ethiopians]] 25.6%, [[Mexican people|Mexicans]] of the [[Yucatan]] 20.9%, [[Penobscot people|Penobscot]] and [[Shinnecock people|Shinnecock]] 22.7%, [[Gurkha]] 33.6%, [[Japanese people|Japanese]] 44.6%, various [[Hindu]]s 40–50%, [[Egyptian people|Egyptians]] 52.3%, [[Near Eastern]] peoples 62–71%, various Europeans 60–80%.

Anthropologist [[Joseph Deniker]] said that the very hairy peoples are the [[Ainu people|Ainu]]s, [[Iranian people|Iranian]]s, [[Australian aborigine]]s ([[Arnhem Land]] being less hairy), [[Toda people|Toda]], [[Dravidian people|Dravidian]]s and [[Melanesian people|Melanesian]]s, while the most glabrous peoples are the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|American Indians]], [[San people|San]], and [[East Asian]]s, who include [[Chinese people|Chinese]], [[Mongol]]s, and [[Malay people|Malay]]s.&lt;ref name="Deniker" /&gt; Deniker said that hairy peoples tend to have thicker beards, eyelashes, and eyebrows but fewer hairs on their scalp.&lt;ref name="Deniker"&gt;{{cite book |last=Deniker |first=Joseph |date=1901 |chapter=Chapter I.

'''Cosmic-Ray Extremely Distributed Observatory (CREDO)''' is a scientific project initiated at the end of August 2016 by Polish scientists from the [[Instytut Fizyki Jądrowej im. Henryka Niewodniczańskiego PAN|Institute of Nuclear Physics]] in [[Kraków]] (researchers from the Czech Republic, Slovakia and Hungary also joined the project) whose purpose is the detection of [[cosmic ray]]s and the search for [[dark matter]].&lt;ref&gt;https://credo.science/credo-read-more/&lt;/ref&gt; Its aim is to involve as many people as possible in the construction of a global system of cosmic ray detectors, from which it will be possible to examine the essence of dark matter. Having a camera and a [[GPS]] module, a [[smartphone]] works well as a detector of particles from space.&lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/abs/1709.05230&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://indico.ifj.edu.pl/event/182/overview&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ncbj.gov.pl/seminaria/cosmic-ray-extremely-distributed-observatory-novel-astrophysical-potential-and-beyond&lt;/ref&gt;

== Objective == 
The main objective of CREDO is the detection and analysis of extended cosmic ray phenomena, so-called super-preshowers (SPS), using existing as well as new infrastructure (cosmic-ray observatories, educational detectors, single detectors etc.). The search for ensembles of cosmic ray events initiated by SPS is yet an untouched topic, in contrast to the current state-of-the-art analysis, which is focused on the detection of single cosmic ray events. Theoretical explanation of SPS could be given either within classical (e.g., photon-photon interaction) or exotic (e.g., Super Heavy Dark Matter decay or annihilation) scenarios, thus detection of SPS would provide a better understanding of particle physics, high energy astrophysics and cosmology. The ensembles of cosmic rays can be classified based on the spatial and temporal extent of particles constituting the ensemble. Some classes of SPS are predicted to have huge spatial distribution, a unique signature detectable only with a facility of global size. Since development and commissioning of a completely new facility with such requirements is economically unwarranted and time-consuming, the global analysis goals are achievable when all types of existing detectors are merged into a worldwide network.  The idea to use the instruments in operation is based on a novel trigger algorithm: in parallel to looking for neighbour surface detectors receiving the signal simultaneously, one should also look for spatially isolated stations clustered in a small time window. On the other hand, CREDO's strategy is also aimed at an active engagement of a large number of participants, who will contribute to the project by using common electronic devices (e.g. smartphones), capable of detecting cosmic rays. It will help not only in expanding the geographical spread of CREDO, but also in managing a large manpower necessary for a more efficient crowd-sourced pattern recognition scheme to identify and classify SPS. A worldwide network of cosmic-ray detectors could not only become a unique tool to study fundamental physics, it will also provide a number of other opportunities, including space-weather or geophysics studies. Among the latter, one can list the potential to predict earthquakes by monitoring the rate of low energy cosmic-ray events. The diversity of goals motivates us to advertise this concept across the astroparticle physics community. &lt;ref&gt;https://arxiv.org/pdf/1709.05230.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://inspirehep.net/record/1623988/plots&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://icd.desy.de/e49245/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.intibs.pl/en/seminars/current-seminars/seminar/1002.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oa.uj.edu.pl/2017czastki/homola.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

== Implementation ==

The user must install an [[Application software|application]] that turns their phone into a cosmic ray detector, connect it to the charger and arrange it horizontally; for example, put it on a table or bedside cabinet. It is also important that the cameras of the device are well covered, for example with a piece of black adhesive tape, and notifications indicated by the blinking of lights are turned off. If a radiation particle passes through a photosensitive matrix in the phone, it will stimulate several pixels, which will be noticed by the program that sends information to the server. Thanks to the GPS module, the time and place of the event is also known. 

All data from smartphones will then be analyzed together in the Academic Computer Center Cyfronet AGH, which will keep participants informed about the progress of the search for signs of high-energy particles.

The application is still{{When|date=November 2018}} under testing and may not produce the expected results on some mobile devices.&lt;ref&gt;https://indico.cern.ch/event/596002/contributions/2447178/attachments/1412820/2161711/credo-highlight-hq.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://aasp.kiev.ua/volume7/23-29-Sushchov.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.researchgate.net/publication/319875663_Cosmic-Ray_Extremely_Distributed_Observatory_a_global_cosmic_ray_detection_framework&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.utef.cvut.cz/seminars/2017-02-21/cosmic-ray-extremely-distributed-observatory:-new-research--possibilities-in-astroparticle-physics&lt;/ref&gt;

== Preview of collected data ==

All traces of particles registered by smartphones can be viewed on a dedicated website. Their size and shape depends on the type and energy of the captured particle and the direction from which it came.

==Life==
Doris Holmes was raised in a middle-class family in [[Stoughton, Massachusetts]]. She earned a B.A. in 1913 from [[Boston University]] and an M.A. in Zoology and Psychology from [[Radcliffe College]] in 1917.&lt;ref name="siarchives"/&gt;&lt;ref name="obituary"/&gt; While at Boston University she became a member of [[Alpha Delta Pi]].&lt;ref&gt;''The Adelphean of Alpha Delta Pi'', Vol. 9, p 137. 1916 article about her working on a degree at Radcliffe after graduating from BU. Also ''Adelphean,'' Vol. 11, p. 263 has the announcement of her marriage to Sidney Fay Blake, Ph.D.&lt;/ref&gt; Marrying the botanical taxonomist [[Sidney Fay Blake]] in 1918, she worked for the [[Bureau of Entomology]] of the United States Department of Agriculture from 1919 to 1928. From 1928 she worked at the Department of [[Entomology]] of the [[United States National Museum]]. Forced to resign in 1933 by her husband's employment at the Department (the law prohibited more than one member of a family holding a government position), she continued studying [[beetles]] as an unpaid Associate of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] at [[Washington, D.C.]] until her death.&lt;ref name="siarchives"/&gt;

[[File:FCMdrug520.png|thumb|right|Rod Tabers FCM depicting eleven factors of the American drug market]]
A '''fuzzy cognitive map''' is a [[cognitive map]] within which the relations between the elements (e.g. concepts, events, project resources) of a "mental landscape" can be used to compute the "strength of impact" of these elements.  Fuzzy cognitive maps were introduced by [[Bart Kosko]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=[[Bart Kosko]]|title=''Fuzzy Cognitive Maps''|journal=International Journal of Man-Machine Studies|volume=24|date=1986|pages=65-75|url=http://sipi.usc.edu/~kosko/FCM.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20060902033901/http://sipi.usc.edu/~kosko/Virtual_Worlds_FCM.pdf] &lt;/ref&gt; Ron Axelrod introduced cognitive maps as a formal way of representing social scientific knowledge and modeling [[decision making]] in social and political systems, then brought in the computation [[fuzzy logic]].{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Details==
Fuzzy cognitive maps are signed fuzzy [[directed graph|digraph]]s.  They may look at [[first blush]] like [[Hasse diagram]]s but they are not.
[[Spreadsheet]]s or tables are used to map FCMs into [[matrix (Mathematics)|matric]]es for further computation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.FCMappers.net/joomla/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=52&amp;Itemid=53 |title=FCMapper - our Fuzzy Cognitive Mapping Software Solution |website=Fcmappers.net |date=2016-01-27 |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ochoadeaspuru.com/fuzcogmap/index.php |title=Fuzzy Cognitive Maps |website=Ochoadeaspuru.com |date= |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jfcm.megadix.it/ |title=JFCM - Java Fuzzy Cognitive Maps |website=Jfcm.megadix.it |date= |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;
FCM is a technique used for causal knowledge acquisition and representation, it supports causal knowledge reasoning process and belong to the neuro-fuzzy system that aim at solving decision making problems, modeling and simulate [[complex system]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.asoc.2012.01.015 |title= Fuzzy Cognitive Maps for Artificial Emotions Forecasting |journal=Applied Soft Computing |volume=12 |issue=2 |page=3704-3710 |year=2012 |first1=Jose L. |last1=Salmeron }}&lt;/ref&gt;. 
Learning algorithms  have been proposed for training and updating FCMs weights mostly based on ideas coming from the field of [[Artificial Neural Network]]s &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi= 10.1016/j.knosys.2016.04.023 |title= Dynamic Optimization of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps for Time Series Forecasting |journal= Knowledge-Based Systems |volume=105 |page=29-37 |year=2016 |first1=Jose L. |last1=Salmeron |first2= W. |last2=Froelich}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Adaptation and learning methodologies used to adapt the FCM model and adjust its weights.  Kosko and Dickerson (Dickerson &amp; Kosko, 1994) suggested the Differential [[Hebbian Learning]] (DHL) to train FCM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://home.eng.iastate.edu/~julied/publications/FCM96.pdf |title=IEEEBook8.dvi |website=Home.eng.iastate.edu |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2017-01-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been proposed algorithms based on the initial Hebbian algorithm;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijar.2004.01.001 |title=Active Hebbian learning algorithm to train fuzzy cognitive maps |journal=International Journal of Approximate Reasoning |volume=37 |issue=3 |page=219 |year=2004 |last1=Papageorgiou |first1=E.I. |last2=Stylios |first2=C.D. |last3=Groumpos |first3=P.P. }}&lt;/ref&gt; others algorithms come from the field of [[genetic algorithms]], [[swarm intelligence]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1007/s10844-005-0864-9 |title=Fuzzy Cognitive Maps Learning Using Particle Swarm Optimization |journal=Journal of Intelligent Information Systems |volume=25 |page=95 |year=2005 |last1=Papageorgiou |first1=Elpiniki I. |last2=Parsopoulos |first2=Konstantinos E. |last3=Stylios |first3=Chrysostomos S. |last4=Groumpos |first4=Petros P. |last5=Vrahatis |first5=Michael N. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and  [[evolutionary computation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |doi=10.1109/FUZZY.2005.1452465 |chapter=Evolutionary Development of Fuzzy Cognitive Maps |title=The 14th IEEE International Conference on Fuzzy Systems, 2005.

Fuzzy cognitive maps (FCMs) have gained considerable research interest due to their ability in representing structured knowledge and model complex systems in various fields. This growing interest led to the need for enhancement and making more reliable models that can better represent real situations.
A first simple application of FCMs is described in a book&lt;ref name="confusion"&gt;William R. Taylor: ''[http://www.americanconfusion.com/?p=122 Lethal American Confusion] (How Bush and the Pacifists Each Failed in the War on Terrorism)'', 2006, {{ISBN|0-595-40655-6}} (FCM application in chapter 14) {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930103802/http://www.americanconfusion.com/?p=122 |date=September 30, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of William R. Taylor, where the war in Afghanistan and Iraq is analyzed. In [[Bart Kosko]]'s book ''Fuzzy Thinking'',&lt;ref name="FuzzyThinking"&gt;Bart Kosko: ''Fuzzy Thinking'', 1993/1995, {{ISBN|0-7868-8021-X}} (Chapter 12: Adaptive Fuzzy Systems)''&lt;/ref&gt; several Hasse diagrams illustrate the use of FCMs. As an example, one FCM quoted from Rod Taber&lt;ref name="Drugs"&gt;Rod Taber: ''Knowledge Processing with Fuzzy Cognitive Maps'', Expert Systems with Applications, vol. 2, no. 1, 83-87, 1991 ([[:de:Bild:FCMdrug520.png|Hasse diagram]] in German Wikipedia)&lt;/ref&gt; describes 11 factors of the American cocaine market and the relations between these factors. For computations, Taylor uses pentavalent logic (scalar values out of {-1,-0.5,0,+0.5,+1}). That particular map of Taber uses [[trivalent logic]] (scalar values out of {-1,0,+1}). Taber et al. also illustrate the dynamics of map fusion and give a theorem on the convergence of combination in a related article.&lt;ref name='Medical'&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1002/int.20185 |title=Quantization effects on the equilibrium behavior of combined fuzzy cognitive maps |journal=International Journal of Intelligent Systems |volume=22 |issue=2 |page=181 |year=2007 |last1=Taber |first1=Rod |last2=Yager |first2=Ronald R. |last3=Helgason |first3=Cathy M. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Garabed T. K. Giragossian''' was an [[Armenians|Armenian]] living in [[Boston]] who is remembered for developing a [[perpetual motion]] device shortly after the turn of the 20th century.  He [[immigrated]] to [[United States|America]] in 1891. In 1917, Giragossian claimed, reportedly [[fraud]]ulently, to have developed a "free energy machine". The assignment of the patent to the United States government was conditionally accepted in Pub. Res. 65-21, {{USStat|40|435}}, enacted on February 8, 1918, and authorized the [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of the Interior]] to form a scientific committee to investigate the machine. The committee issued a report on July 1, 1918 finding that the principles were not sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | title= Automotive Industries | volume= 39 | publisher= Chilton company | page= 34 | url= https://books.google.com/books?id=dM8qAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA34 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to an editorial in the Scientific American in 1918, Giragossian claimed that the machine, named Garabed, took energy out of the cosmos and turned it into mechanical motion.&lt;ref name=JAMA&gt;Discoveries and Discoverers. JAMA Revisited, August 7, 2018 JAMA. 2018;320(5):512. doi:10.1001/jama.2017.12501, Originally published JAMA. August 10, 1918;71(6):465&lt;/ref&gt;

Editors of the [[Journal of the American Medical Association]] compared him and his methods with [[Quackery|quack]]s in the medical world; they pointed out that he could not answer the question what qualifications he had to undertake his work, and that he repeatedly only replied, he was an honest man and that he could prove it with signatures of friends and sponsors. They deplored the waste of time of "scientific men in investigating alleged discoveries by men who are utterly lacking in the fundamental qualifications needed [...]."&lt;ref name=JAMA/&gt;

Supposedly involved in a [[conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], [[Woodrow Wilson]] signed a [[Resolution (policy debate)|resolution]] offering him protection.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} The device was a giant [[flywheel]] that was charged up with [[energy]] slowly and put out a lot of energy for just a [[second]].{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

[[Halloween]], a contraction of "All Hallows' Eve", is a celebration observed on 31 October, the day before the feast of [[All Hallows' Day|All Hallows']]. The celebrations and observances of this day occur primarily in regions of the Western world, although some traditions vary significantly between geographical areas.

==Origins==
{{Main article|Halloween}}
Halloween, also spelled as Hallowe'en or Allhallowe'en, is a contraction of All Hallows' Eve, the eve or [[vigil]] before the Western Christian feast of All Hallows (or All Saints) which is observed on 1 November. This day begins the triduum of [[Hallowtide]], which culminates with [[All Souls' Day]]. In the [[Middle Ages]], many Christians held a folk belief that All Hallows' Eve was the "night where the veil between the material world and the [[Christian views on Hades|afterlife]] was at its most transparent."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Devros|first1=Isabelle|title=Little monsters play on All Hallow's Eve|url=http://www.armidaleexpress.com.au/story/2662750/little-monsters-play-on-all-hallows-eve/?cs=475|publisher=The Armidale Express|accessdate=2014-10-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Asia==

===China===
The Chinese celebrate the "Hungry Ghost Festival" in mid-July, when it is customary to float river lanterns to remember those who have died. By contrast, Halloween is often called "All Saints' Day" (''Wànshèngjié'', 萬聖節), or (less commonly, but more correctly) "All Saints' Eve" (''Wànshèngyè'', 萬聖夜) or "Eve of All Saints' Day" (''Wànshèngjié Qiányè'', ''萬聖節前夕''), stemming from the term "All Hallows Eve" (hallow referring to the souls of holy saints). Chinese Christian churches hold religious celebrations. Non-religious celebrations are dominated by expatriate Americans or Canadians, but costume parties are also popular for Chinese young adults, especially in large cities. [[Hong Kong Disneyland]] and [[Ocean Park Hong Kong|Ocean Park]] ([[Ocean Park Halloween Bash|Halloween Bash]]) host annual Halloween shows.

[[Mainland China]] has been less influenced by [[Anglo]] traditions than Hong Kong and Halloween is generally considered "foreign". As Halloween has become more popular globally it has also become more popular in China, however, particularly amongst children attending private or international schools with many foreign teachers from North America.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Wu Ni|date=30 October 2013|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/china/2013-10/30/content_17070057.htm|title=Halloween gaining popularity but still sees cultural differences|work=[[China Daily]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Hong Kong====

Traditional "door-to-door" trick or treating is not commonly practiced in Hong Kong due to the vast majority of Hong Kong residents living in high-rise apartment blocks. However, in many buildings catering to expatriates, Halloween parties and limited trick or treating is arranged by the management. Instances of street-level trick or treating in Hong Kong occur in ultra-exclusive gated housing communities such as [[The Beverly Hills]] populated by Hong Kong's super-rich and in expatriate areas like Discovery Bay and the Red Hill Peninsula. For the general public, there are events at Tsim Sha Tsui's Avenue of the Stars that try to mimic the celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gohongkong.about.com/od/hongkongfestivals/a/halloweeninhk.htm|title=Events and Celebrations for Halloween in Hong Kong|last=Boland|first=Rory|date=30 October 2009|work=About.com|accessdate=31 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Lan Kwai Fong]] area of Hong Kong, known as a major entertainment district for the international community, a Halloween celebration and parade has taken place for over 20 years, with many people dressing in costume and making their way around the streets to various drinking establishments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lan Kwai Fong Halloween Street Party |url=http://www.lankwaifong.com/halloween/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151101071409/http://www.lankwaifong.com/halloween/ |archivedate=1 November 2015 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Many international schools also celebrate Halloween with costumes, and some put an academic twist on the celebrations such as the "Book-o-ween" celebrations at [[Hong Kong International School]] where students dress as favorite literary characters.

===Japan===
[[File:Halloweendisplay-2012-saitama.jpg|thumb|A Halloween display in a local bank window, in [[Saitama prefecture|Saitama]], Japan.]]
Halloween arrived in [[Japan]] mainly as a result of American [[popular culture|pop culture]]. As recently as 2009, it was not appreciated and only celebrated by expats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ashcraft|first1=Brian|title=Japan's Infamous Halloween Trains|url=https://kotaku.com/japans-infamous-halloween-trains-1819762246|accessdate=24 October 2017|work=[[Gizmodo]]|date=23 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The wearing of elaborate [[costume]]s by young adults at night is recently very popular in areas such as [[Amerikamura]] in [[Osaka]] and [[Shibuya]] in [[Tokyo]], where, in October 2012, about 1700 people dressed in costumes to take part in the Halloween Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.upi.com/News_Photos/Features/Halloween-in-Japan/fp/7197 |title=Halloween in Japan |publisher=UPI.com |date=26 October 2012 |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The holiday has become popular with young adults as a costume party and club event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.marketwatch.com/story/how-japan-fell-in-love-with-halloween-for-adults-2014-10-30|last=Richards|first=Jeff W.|title=How Japan fell in love with Halloween for adults|work=Market Watch|publisher=Dow Jones|date=30 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trick or Treating for Japanese children has taken hold in some areas.

===Philippines===
The period from 31 October through 2 November is a time for remembering dead family members and friends. Many Filipinos travel back to their hometowns for family gatherings of festive remembrance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://asianjournal.com/lifestyle/how-do-we-spell-halloween-in-the-philippines/|last1=Canopio|first1=Camille|last2=Distor|first2=Tessa|title=How do we spell 'Halloween' in the Philippines?|work=Asian Journal|date=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trick-or treating is gradually replacing the dying tradition of ''Pangangaluluwâ'', a local analogue of the old English custom of [[souling]]. People in the provinces still observe ''Pangangaluluwâ'' by going in groups to every house and offering a song in exchange for money or food. The participants, usually children, would sing carols about the souls in [[Purgatory]], with the ''abúloy'' (alms for the dead) used to pay for Masses for these souls. Along with the requested alms, householders sometimes gave the children ''[[Suman (food)|suman]]'' (rice cakes). During the night, various small items, such as clothing, plants, etc., would "mysteriously" disappear, only to be discovered the next morning in the yard or in the middle of the street. In older times, it was believed that the spirits of ancestors and loved ones visited the living on this night, manifesting their presence by taking an item.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ireport.cnn.com/docs/DOC-509344 |title=Halloween in the Philippines – CNN iReport |publisher=Ireport.cnn.com |date=28 October 2010 |accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the observation of [[Christmas in the Philippines|Christmas]] traditions in the Philippines begins as early as September, it is a common sight to see Halloween decorations next to Christmas decorations in urban settings.{{cn|date=December 2017}}

==Australia and New Zealand==
[[File:Halloween display in Sydney.jpg|thumb|Halloween display in [[Sydney]], [[Australia]].]]
While not traditionally a part of Australian culture, non-religious celebrations of Halloween modeled on [[North America]]n festivities are growing increasingly popular in Australia,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halloween-australia.com/|title=Halloween in Australia - Halloween Australia|website=Halloween Australia|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in spite of seasonal differences and the transition from spring to summer. Criticism stems largely from the fact that Halloween has little relevance to Australian culture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/story/0,27574,26283533-421,00.html |title=Should Australians be Hallo-weaned off Halloween celebrations? |work=news.com.au |date=31 October 2009 |accessdate=1 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091101035209/http://www.news.com.au/story/0%2C27574%2C26283533-421%2C00.html |archivedate= 1 November 2009 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=smh&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/hell-of-a-row-as-kids-buy-into-imported-halloween-rituals-20091031-hqpn.html|title=Hell of a row as kids buy into imported Halloween rituals|first1=Rachel|last1=Browne|first2=Jonno|last2=Seidler|newspaper=[[The Sydney Morning Herald]]|date=1 November 2009|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also considered, by some Australians, to be an unwanted American influence; as although Halloween does have Celtic/European origins, its increasing popularity in Australia is largely as a result of American pop-culture influence.&lt;ref name=smh /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.news.com.au/comments/0,23600,26283533-421,00.html |title=Should Australians be Hallo-weaned off Halloween celebrations?

Due to the opposition to Halloween by some people, there is a growing movement where people are inviting trick-or-treaters to take part by putting a balloon or decoration on their letter box, to indicate that they are welcome to come knocking. In the past decade, the popularity of Halloween in Australia has grown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-10-30/love-it-or-hate-it-halloween-likely-to-continue-in-australia/6889420|title=Halloween: a festival that polarises Australians|date=30 October 2015|website=Abc.net.au|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Zealand, as in neighbouring Australia, Halloween is not celebrated to the same extent as in North America, although in recent years the non-religious celebrations have been achieving some popularity especially among young children.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kiwifamilies.co.nz/articles/halloween/ |title=Halloween in NZ |author=Kiwi Families |date= |accessdate=16 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://my.christchurchcitylibraries.com/halloween/|title=Halloween|website=My.christchurchcitylibraries.com|accessdate=1 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trick-or-treat has become increasingly popular with minors in New Zealand over the years, despite being not a "British or Kiwi event" that purely is only influenced by American globalization.&lt;ref name="NZHeraldTrickTreat"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.nzherald.co.nz/lifestyle/news/article.cfm?c_id=6&amp;objectid=12151853 |title=Halloween trick or treating: How old is too old?

==Europe==
Over the years, Halloween has become more successful in Europe and has been partially ousting some older customs like the ''{{ill|Rübengeistern|de|display=y}}'' ({{lang-en|turnip ghosts, beet spirit}}), [[Martinisingen]], and others.&lt;ref Name="Hör"&gt;Halloween in der Steiermark und anderswo, Volkskunde (Münster in Westfalen), Hrsg.

===Sweden===
On All Hallow's Eve, a [[Requiem Mass]] is widely attended every year at [[Uppsala Cathedral]], part of the Lutheran [[Church of Sweden]].&lt;ref name="VlasBoari2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vlas|first1=Natalia|last2=Boari|first2=Vasile|title=Religion and Politics in the 21st Century: Global and Local Reflections|date=2013|publisher=Cambridge Scholars Publishing|isbn=9781443850766|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the period of Allhallowtide, starting with All Hallow's Eve, Swedish families visit churchyards and adorn the graves of their family members with lit candles and wreaths fashioned from pine branches.&lt;ref name="VlasBoari2013"/&gt;

Among children, the practice of dressing in costume and collecting candy has gained popularity in recent years.&lt;ref name="Phil2016"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Pihl|first1=Anne|title=Halloween – my first time trick-or-treating in Sweden|url=http://www.relocatetosweden.com/en/halloween-first-time-trick-treating-sweden/|website=Relocate To Sweden|date=28 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Bosnia and Herzegovina===
Halloween is a work day in [[Bosnia and Herzegovina]], and not celebrated until recently. For the past few years, it has been popular among younger generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sarajevo-x.com/showtime/clanak/111101038|title=Upoznajte sarajevske vještice i vješce&amp;nbsp;– Klix.ba|work=Sarajevo-x.com|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since wearing masks has become highly popular among children and teenagers, e.g. in many Bosnian schools, both elementary as well as high schools (secondary schools and vocational), students will usually wear costumes and masks on Halloween. There it is called ''Noć vještica'' ({{lang-en|Night of Witches}}).

===Germany===
Halloween was not generally observed in Germany prior to the 1990s, but has been increasing in popularity. It has been associated with the influence of United States culture, and "Trick or Treating" (in German, ''"Süßes sonst gibt's Saures"'') has been occurring in various German cities, especially in areas such as the [[Dahlem (Berlin)|Dahlem]] neighborhood in Berlin, which was part of the American zone during the [[Cold War]]. Today, Halloween in Germany brings in 200 million euros a year, through multiple industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Das Geschäft mit dem Gruselfest: Aus Halloween wird Hallowahn - Stuttgarter Zeitung|url = http://www.stuttgarter-zeitung.de/inhalt.das-geschaeft-mit-dem-gruselfest-aus-halloween-wird-hallowahn.efeab0e3-fdb3-4035-b698-62048e30f267.html|website = stuttgarter-zeitung.de|accessdate = 2015-10-31|language = de}}&lt;/ref&gt; Halloween is celebrated by both children and adults. Adults celebrate at themed costume parties and clubs, while children go trick or treating. Complaints of vandalism associated with Halloween "Tricks" are increasing, particularly from many elderly Germans unfamiliar with "Trick or Treating".&lt;ref&gt;Rupert Neate and Nicholas Connolly (31 October 2013), [http://www.spiegel.de/international/zeitgeist/rise-of-halloween-culture-sees-backlash-in-germany-a-931005.html Holiday Backlash: Germans Cringe at Rise of Halloween] ''[[Der Spiegel]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Greece===
Halloween has been increasing in popularity in [[Greece]] during the 2010s, as a commercial and secular celebration. It has been associated with the influence of the western culture. Bars, nightclubs and fun parks organise Halloween parties.

===Romania===
Romanians observe the [[St. Andrew's Day|Feast of St. Andrew]], patron saint of Romania, on 30 November. On St. Andrew's Eve ghosts are said to be about. A number of customs related to divination, in other places connected to Halloween, are associated with this night.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://traditionsacrosseurope.wordpress.com/2008/11/25/st-andrews-day-in-romania/ |title=St. Andrew's Day in Romania |publisher=Traditionsacrosseurope.wordpress.com |date=2008-11-25 |accessdate=2013-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, with the popularity of Dracula in western Europe, around Halloween the Romanian tourist industry promotes trips to locations connected to the historical [[Vlad the Impaler|Vlad Tepeș]] and the more fanciful Dracula of [[Bram Stoker]]. The most successful Halloween Party in Transylvania takes place in [[Sighișoara]], the citadel where Vlad the Impaler was born.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visit-transylvania.co.uk/romania-travel-transylvania/halloween-party-transylvania.html|title=Transylvania Live – Awarded Halloween in Transylvania Party, Halloween Short Break, Dracula Short Break, Romania travel|publisher=Visit-transylvania.co.uk|accessdate=20 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=November 2015}}

===Russia===
In Russia most Christians are Orthodox, and in the Orthodox Church Halloween is on the Saturday after Pentecost and therefore 4–5 months before western Halloween. Celebration of western Halloween began in the 1990s around the downfall of the Soviet regime, when costume and ghoulish parties spread throughout night clubs throughout Russia. Halloween is generally celebrated by younger generations and is not widely celebrated in civic society (e.g. theaters or libraries). In fact, Halloween is among the Western celebrations that the Russian government and politicians—which have grown increasingly anti-Western in the early 2010s—are trying to eliminate from public celebration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Shuster|first1=Simon|title=Russian Region Wages War on Halloween|url=http://world.time.com/2013/10/31/halloween-extremist-says-russian-region-enacting-ban/|website=World.time.com|accessdate=24 October 2014|date=31 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Bennetts|first1=Marc|title=Nyet on Halloween: Russian church warns of 'dangers'; Siberia bans holiday|url=http://www.washingtontimes.com/news/2013/oct/30/authorities-warn-russians-dangers-halloween/|accessdate=24 October 2014|work=Washington Times|date=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Russia: Activist calls for Halloween ban|url=https://www.bbc.com/news/blogs-news-from-elsewhere-29742511|accessdate=24 October 2014|work=BBC News|date=23 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Poland and the Czech Republic===
Since the [[fall of Communism]] in 1989, Halloween has become increasingly popular in Poland and the Czech Republic. Particularly, it is celebrated among younger people. The influx of Western tourists and expats throughout the 1990s introduced the costume party aspect of Hallowe'en celebrations, particularly in clubs and at private house parties. Door-to-door trick or treating is not common.  Pumpkin carving is becoming more evident, following a strong North American version of the tradition.

===Switzerland===
In [[Switzerland]], Halloween, after first becoming popular in 1999, is on the wane, and is most popular with young adults who attend parties. Switzerland already has a "festival overload" and even though Swiss people like to dress up for any occasion, they do prefer a traditional element, such as in the [[Fasnacht]] tradition of chasing away winter using noise and masks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/Home/Archive/Halloween_retailers_get_a_shock.html?cid=6223458|title=Interest in Halloween in Switzerland starts to wane|work=Swissinfo.ch|date=31 October 2007|accessdate=1 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://lenews.ch/2014/10/30/halloween-in-switzerland/ Taylor, Pamela.

In the past, on All Souls' Eve families would stay up late, and little "soul cakes" were eaten. At the stroke of midnight, there was solemn silence among households, which had candles burning in every room to guide the souls back to visit their earthly homes and a glass of wine on the table to refresh them. The tradition of giving soul cakes that originated in Great Britain and Ireland was known as [[souling]], often seen as the origin of modern [[trick or treating]] in North America, and souling continued in parts of England as late as the 1930s, with children going from door to door singing songs and saying prayers for the dead in return for cakes or money.&lt;ref name=AFP&gt;{{cite book|first=Nicholas|last=Rogers|title=Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|pages=28–30|isbn=0-19-514691-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American-style Halloween celebrations have become increasingly popular with shops decorated with witches and pumpkins, and young people attending costume parties.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/how-halloween-has-taken-over-england-180953211/?no-ist Hanc, John.

The name ''Halloween'' is first attested in the 16th century as a Scottish shortening of the fuller ''All-Hallow-Even'', that is, the night before All Hallows' Day.&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite OED|Hallow-e'en}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dumfries]] poet [[John Mayne]]'s 1780 poem made note of pranks at Halloween "What fearfu' pranks ensue!".

Traditional customs and [[folklore|lore]] include [[divination]] practices, ways of trying to predict the future. A traditional Scottish form of divining one's future spouse is to carve an apple in one long strip, then toss the peel over one's shoulder. The peel is believed to land in the shape of the first letter of the future spouse's name.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=McNeill|first=F.

==Canada==
Scottish emigration, primarily to Canada before 1870 and to the United States thereafter, brought the Scottish version of the holiday to each country. The earliest known reference to ritual begging on Halloween in English speaking North America occurs in 1911, when a newspaper in [[Kingston, Ontario]] reported that it was normal for the smaller children to go street "[[guising]]" on Halloween between 6 and 7 p.m., visiting shops and neighbours to be rewarded with nuts and candies for their rhymes and songs.&lt;ref name="ATP"/&gt; Canadians spend more on candy at Halloween than at any time apart from Christmas. Halloween is also a time for charitable contributions.

==United States==
In the United States, where lingering [[Puritan]] tradition restricted the observance of many holidays, Halloween did not become a holiday until the 19th century. The transatlantic migration of nearly two million Irish following the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Great Famine (1845–1849)]] brought the holiday to the United States.

American librarian and author [[Ruth Edna Kelley]] wrote the first book length history of the holiday in the U.S., ''The Book of Hallowe'en'' (1919), and references [[souling]] in the chapter "Hallowe'en in America": "All Hallowe'en customs in the United States are borrowed directly or adapted from those of other countries. The taste in Hallowe'en festivities now is to study old traditions, and hold a Scotch party, using [[Robert Burns]]'s poem ''[[Halloween (poem)|Halloween]]'' as a guide; or to go a-souling as the English used. In short, no custom that was once honored at Hallowe'en is out of fashion now."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sacred-texts.com/pag/boh/boh17.htm |title=The Book of Hallowe'en: Chapter XV: Hallowe'en in America |publisher=Sacred-texts.com |accessdate=21 November 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main event for children of modern Halloween in the United States and Canada is [[trick-or-treating]], in which children, teenagers, (sometimes) young adults, and parents  (accompanying their children) disguise themselves in [[Halloween costume|costume]]s and go door-to-door in their neighborhoods, ringing each doorbell and yelling "Trick or treat!" to solicit a gift of candy or similar items.&lt;ref name=ADH&gt;{{cite book|last=Rogers|first=Nicholas|year=2002|chapter=Coming Over: Halloween in North America|title=Halloween: From Pagan Ritual to Party Night|pages=49–77|location=New York|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=0-19-516896-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Teenagers and adults will more frequently attend Halloween-themed costume parties typically hosted by friends or themed events at nightclubs either on Halloween itself or a weekend close to the holiday.

At the turn of the 20th century, Halloween had turned into a night of [[vandalism]], with destruction of property and cruelty to animals and people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nyise.org/hallowhistory.html |title=Halloween History |publisher=Nyise.org |accessdate=21 November 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141031031331/http://www.nyise.org/hallowhistory.html |archivedate=31 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Around 1912, the [[Boy Scouts of America|Boy Scouts]], [[Boys &amp; Girls Clubs of America|Boys Clubs]], and other neighborhood organizations came together to encourage a safe celebration that would end the destruction that had become so common on this night.

The commercialization of Halloween in the United States did not start until the 20th century, beginning perhaps with [[Halloween card|Halloween postcards]] (featuring hundreds of designs), which were most popular between 1905 and 1915.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shaktiweb.com/postcards|title=Antique Halloween Postcards and E-cards|accessdate=14 September 2006|last=Anderson|first=Richard|year=2000|publisher=shaktiweb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dennison Manufacturing Company (which published its first Halloween catalog in 1909) and the Beistle Company were pioneers in commercially made Halloween decorations, particularly die-cut paper items.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spookshows.com/beistle/beistle.htm|title=Beistle: An American Halloween Giant|accessdate=14 September 2006|author=Dawn Kroma|author2=Lou Kroma|publisher=Spookshows.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.halloweencollector.com/history|title=A Brief History of Halloween Collectibles|accessdate=14 September 2006|last=Ledenbach|first=Mark B.|publisher=halloweencollector.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; German manufacturers specialised in Halloween figurines that were exported to the United States in the period between the two World Wars.

Halloween is now the United States' second most popular holiday (after Christmas) for decorating; the sale of candy and costumes is also extremely common during the holiday, which is marketed to children and adults alike. The [[National Confectioners Association]] (NCA) reported in 2005 that 80% of American adults planned to give out candy to trick-or-treaters.&lt;ref name="candyusa.org1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.candyusa.org/Media/Seasonal/Halloween/pr_2005.asp|title=Trick-or-treaters can expect Mom or Dad's favorites in their bags this year|accessdate=14 September 2006|year=2005|publisher=National Confectioners Association|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060827010441/http://www.candyusa.org/Media/Seasonal/Halloween/pr_2005.asp|archivedate=27 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Saint Helena]], Halloween is actively celebrated, largely along the American model, with ghosts, skeletons, devils, vampires, witches and the like.

In the [[Dominican Republic]] it has been gaining popularity, largely due to many Dominicans living in the States and then bringing it to the island. In the larger cities of [[Santiago de los Caballeros|Santiago]] or [[Santo Domingo]] it has become more common to see children trick-or-treating, but in smaller towns and villages it is almost entirely absent, partly due to religious opposition.

==History==
A constellation of symptoms named "[[Gay-related immune deficiency]]" was noted in 1982. In 1983, a group of scientists and doctors at the [[Pasteur Institute]] in France, led by [[Luc Montagnier]], discovered a new virus in a patient with signs and symptoms that often preceded AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Barré-Sinoussi |first1= F |last2= Chermann |first2= J |last3= Rey |first3= F |last4= Nugeyre |first4= M |last5= Chamaret |first5= S |last6= Gruest |first6= J |last7= Dauguet |first7= C |last8= Axler-Blin |first8= C |last9= Vézinet-Brun |first9= F |last10= Rouzioux |first10= C |last11= Rozenbaum |first11= W |last12= Montagnier |display-authors= 2 |first12= L |title= Isolation of a T-lymphotropic retrovirus from a patient at risk for acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS) |journal= Science |volume= 220 |issue= 4599 |pages= 868–71 |year= 1983 |pmid= 6189183 |doi= 10.1126/science.6189183 |bibcode= 1983Sci...220..868B}}&lt;/ref&gt; They named the virus ''lymphadenopathy-associated virus'', or LAV, and sent samples to [[Robert Gallo]]'s team in the United States. Their findings were [[peer reviewed]] and slated for publication in ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]''.

At a 23 April 1984 press conference in Washington, D.C., [[Margaret Heckler]], Secretary of [[Health and Human Services]], announced that Gallo and his co-workers had discovered a virus that is the "probable" cause of AIDS. This virus was initially named HTLV-III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Sarngadharan |first1=MG |last2= DeVico |first2= AL |last3= Bruch |first3= L |last4=  Schüpbach |first4= J |last5= Gallo |first5= RC |display-authors= 2 |title= HTLV-III: The etiologic agent of AIDS |journal= Int.

Schmidt compared AIDS to documented cases of epidemic hysteria in the past which were mistakenly thought to be infectious. (Schmidt himself would later die of AIDS in 1994.){{sfn|Kalichman|2009|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=_mtDBCDwxugC&amp;pg=PA26 26]}}&lt;ref name="denialists-who-have-died"&gt;{{cite web |work= aidstruth.org |url= http://www.aidstruth.org/denialism/dead_denialists |title= AIDS Denialists Who Have Died |accessdate= 15 June 2009 |archive-date= 26 January 2010 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20100126000256/http://www.aidstruth.org/denialism/dead_denialists |deadurl= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1986, the viruses discovered by Montagnier and Gallo, found to be genetically indistinguishable, were renamed HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Coffin |first1= J |last2= Haase |first2= A |last3= Levy |first3= J |last4= Montagnier |first4= L |last5= Oroszlan |first5= S |last6= Teich |first6= N |last7= Temin |first7= H |last8= Toyoshima |first8= K |last9= Varmus |first9= H |last10= Vogt |first10= P |display-authors= 2 |title= What to call the AIDS virus? |journal= Nature |volume= 321 |issue= 6065 |page= 10 |year= 1986 |pmid= 3010128 |doi= 10.1038/321010a0 |bibcode = 1986Natur.321...10.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, the molecular biologist [[Peter Duesberg]] questioned the link between HIV and AIDS in the journal ''[[Cancer Research (journal)|Cancer Research]]''.&lt;ref name=duesberg1987&gt;{{cite journal |last= Duesberg |first= P |title= Retroviruses as carcinogens and pathogens: Expectations and reality |journal= [[Cancer Research (journal)|Cancer Research]] |volume= 47 |issue= 5 |pages= 1199–220 |year= 1987 |pmid= 3028606}}&lt;/ref&gt; Duesberg's publication coincided with the start of major [[public health]] campaigns and the development of [[zidovudine]] (AZT) as a treatment for HIV/AIDS.

In 1988, a panel of the [[Institute of Medicine]] of the [[U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] found that "the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is scientifically conclusive."&lt;ref name=iomreport&gt;{{cite web | url = http://books.nap.edu/openbook.php?record_id=771&amp;page=2 | title = Confronting AIDS: Update 1988 | publisher = [[Institute of Medicine]] of the [[U.S. National Academy of Sciences]] | year = 1988 | quote = …the evidence that HIV causes AIDS is scientifically conclusive.}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, ''Science'' published Blattner, Gallo, and Temin's "HIV causes AIDS",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Blattner |first1= W |last2= Gallo |first2= RC |last3= Temin |first3= HM |title= HIV causes AIDS |journal= Science |volume= 241 |issue= 4865 |pages= 515–6 |year= 1988 |pmid= 3399881 |doi= 10.1126/science.3399881 |url= http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/241/4865/515 |bibcode= 1988Sci...241..515B}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Duesberg's "HIV is not the cause of AIDS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Duesberg |first= P |title= HIV is not the cause of AIDS |journal= Science |volume= 241 |issue= 4865 |page= 514 |year= 1988 |pmid= 3399880 |doi= 10.1126/science.3399880 |url= http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/241/4865/514|bibcode = 1988Sci...241..514D}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also that same year, the [[The Perth Group|Perth Group]], a group of denialists based in [[Perth, Western Australia]] led by Eleni Papadopulos-Eleopulos,  published in the non-peer-reviewed journal ''[[Medical Hypotheses]]'' their first article questioning aspects of HIV/AIDS research,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Papadopulos-Eleopulos |first= E |title= Reappraisal of AIDS – Is the oxidation induced by the risk factors the primary cause? |journal= [[Medical Hypotheses]] |volume= 25 |issue= 3 |pages= 151–62 |year=1988 |pmid= 3285143 |doi= 10.1016/0306-9877(88)90053-9 |url= http://theperthgroup.com/SCIPAPERS/reappraisalofaids.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that there was "no compelling reason for preferring the viral hypothesis of AIDS to one based on the activity of oxidising agents."

In 1989, Duesberg exercised his right, as a member of the National Academy of Sciences, to bypass the peer review process and publish his arguments in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]'' (''PNAS'') unreviewed. The editor of ''PNAS'' initially resisted, but ultimately allowed Duesberg to publish, saying, "If you wish to make these unsupported, vague, and prejudicial statements in print, so be it. But I cannot see how this would be convincing to any scientifically trained reader."&lt;ref name=sciencebooth/&gt;

In 1990, [[Robert Root-Bernstein]] published his first peer-reviewed article detailing his objections to the mainstream view of AIDS and HIV.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Root-Bernstein |first= R |title= Do we know the cause(s) of AIDS? |journal= [[Perspectives in Biology and Medicine]] |volume= 33 |issue= 4 |pages= 480–500 |year= 1990 |pmid= 2216658}}&lt;/ref&gt; In it, he questioned both the mainstream view and the "dissident" view as potentially inaccurate.

In 1991, The Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV-AIDS Hypothesis, comprising twelve scientists, doctors, and activists, submitted a short letter to various journals, but the letter was rejected.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kZOso0FMsrMC | title=Impure Science: AIDS, Activism, and the Politics of Knowledge | publisher=University of California Press |last= Epstein |first= Steven | year=1996 | pages=143–4 |isbn= 9780520921252}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1993, ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' published an editorial arguing that Duesberg had forfeited his [[right of reply]] by engaging in disingenuous rhetorical techniques and ignoring any evidence that conflicted with his claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Maddox |first= J |title= Has Duesberg a right of reply? |journal= Nature |volume= 363 |issue= 6425 |page= 109 |year= 1993 |pmid= 8483492 |doi= 10.1038/363109a0 |bibcode= 1993Natur.363..109M}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, Papadopulos-Eleopulos et al. of the Perth Group, alleged in the journal ''[[Nature Biotechnology]]'' (then edited by fellow denialist [[Harvey Bialy]]) that the [[Western blot]] test for HIV was not standardized, non-reproducible, and of unknown specificity due to a claimed lack of a "[[Gold standard (test)|gold standard]]".&lt;ref name= "Papadopulos1993"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Papadopulos-Eleopulos |first1= E |last2= Turner |first2= VF |last3= Papadimitriou |first3= JM |title= Is a positive western blot proof of HIV infection? |journal= [[Nature Biotechnology]] |volume= 11 |issue= 6 |pages= 696–707 |year= 1993 |pmid= 7763673 |doi= 10.1038/nbt0693-696 |url= http://theperthgroup.com/SCIPAPERS/biotek8.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Kalichman|2009|p= [https://books.google.com/books?id=_mtDBCDwxugC&amp;pg=PA170 170]}}

On 28 October 1994, [[Robert Willner]], a physician whose medical license had been revoked for, among other things, treating an AIDS patient with [[ozone therapy]], publicly jabbed his finger with blood he said was from an HIV-infected patient.&lt;ref name=Cohen/&gt; Willner died in 1995 of a heart attack.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  |last= Bugl |first= P |title= The Rise of HIV/AIDS |publisher= Department of Mathematics, University of Hartford |url= http://uhavax.hartford.edu/bugl/rise.htm |accessdate= 22 January 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070204142451/http://uhavax.hartford.edu/bugl/rise.htm |archivedate= 4 February 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, The Group for the Scientific Reappraisal of the HIV-AIDS Hypothesis in 1991 published a letter in ''Science'' similar to the one they had attempted to publish in 1991.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Baumann |first1= E |last2= Bethell |first2= T |last3= Bialy |first3= H |last4= Duesberg |first4= P |last5= Farber |first5= C |last6= Geshekter |first6= C |last7= Johnson |first7= P |last8= Maver |first8= R |last9= Schoch |first9= R |last10= Stewart |first10= G |display-authors= 2 |title= AIDS proposal.

In 2006, [[Celia Farber]], a journalist and prominent HIV/AIDS denialist, published an essay in the March issue of ''[[Harper's Magazine]]'' entitled "Out of Control: AIDS and the Corruption of Medical Science", in which she summarized a number of arguments for HIV/AIDS denialism and alleged incompetence, [[Conspiracy (crime)|conspiracy]], and fraud on the part of the medical community.&lt;ref name=harpers&gt;{{cite news |first= C |last= Farber |title= Out of control: AIDS and the corruption of medical science |magazine =[[Harper's Magazine]] |date=March 2006 |url= http://www.harpers.org/archive/2006/03/0080961 |accessdate= 11 June 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090504174126/http://www.harpers.org/archive/2006/03/0080961 |archivedate= 4 May 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientists and AIDS activists extensively criticized the article as inaccurate, misleading, and poorly fact-checked.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/13/business/media/13harpers.html |title= An article in Harper's ignites a controversy over HIV |last= Miller |first= L |newspaper= The New York Times |date= 13 March 2006 |accessdate= 25 May 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.tac.org.za/Documents/ErrorsInFarberArticle.pdf |last1= Gallo |first1= R |last2= Geffen |first2= N |last3= Gonsalves |first3= G |last4= Jefferys |first4= R |last5= Kuritzkes |first5= DR |last6= Mirken |first6= B |last7= Moore |first7= JP |last8= Safrit |first8= JT |display-authors= 2 |title= Errors in Celia Farber's March 2006 article in Harper's Magazine |publisher= [[Treatment Action Campaign]] |date= 25 March 2006 |accessdate= 11 June 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090616194132/http://tac.org.za/Documents/ErrorsInFarberArticle.pdf |archivedate= 16 June 2009 |deadurl= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, members of the Perth Group testified at an appeals hearing for [[Andre Chad Parenzee]], asserting that HIV could not be transmitted by heterosexual sex. The judge concluded, "I reject the evidence of Ms Papadopulos-Eleopulos and Dr Turner. I conclude… that they are not qualified to give expert opinions."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/national/shadow-of-doubters/2007/05/04/1177788403414.html?page=fullpage |newspaper= [[Brisbane Times]] |title= Shadow of doubters |date= 5 May 2007 |accessdate= 11 June 2009 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090427144255/http://www.brisbanetimes.com.au/news/national/shadow-of-doubters/2007/05/04/1177788403414.html?page=fullpage |archivedate= 27 April 2009 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, a paper was published in the then non-peer-reviewed journal ''[[Medical Hypotheses]]'' by Duesberg and four other researchers which criticized a 2008 study by Chigwedere et al. which found that HIV/AIDS denialism in South Africa resulted in hundreds of thousands of preventable deaths from HIV/AIDS, because the government delayed the provision of antiretroviral drugs. The paper concluded that "the claims that HIV has caused huge losses of African lives are unconfirmed and that HIV is not sufficient or even necessary to cause the previously known diseases, now called AIDS in the presence of antibody against HIV."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Duesberg|first1=PH|last2=Nicholson|first2=JM|last3=Rasnick|first3=D|last4=Fiala|first4=C|last5=Bauer|first5=HH |display-authors= 2 |title=WITHDRAWN: HIV-AIDS hypothesis out of touch with South African AIDS - A new perspective.|journal=[[Medical Hypotheses]]|date=19 July 2009|pmid=19619953|url=http://www.duesberg.com/2009_Duesberg_et_al_Medical_Hypotheses.pdf|doi=10.1016/j.mehy.2009.06.024}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, the paper was withdrawn from the journal on the grounds of it having methodological flaws, and that it contained assertions "that could potentially be damaging to global public health”.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.nature.com/news/paper-denying-hiv-aids-link-secures-publication-1.9737 | title=Paper denying HIV–AIDS link secures publication | work=[[Nature (journal)|Nature]] | date=5 January 2012 | accessdate=10 October 2016 |last= Corbyn |first= Zöe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===U.S. courts===
In 1998, HIV/AIDS denialism and parental rights clashed with the medical establishment in court when Maine resident Valerie Emerson fought for the right to refuse to give AZT to her four-year-old son, Nikolas Emerson, after she witnessed the death of her daughter Tia, who died at the age of three in 1996. Her right to stop treatment was upheld by the court in light of "her unique experience."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1998/09/20/us/boy-is-healthy-without-drug-for-hiv-mother-says.html |title= Boy is healthy without drug for HIV, mother says |newspaper= [[The New York Times]] |date= 20 September 1998 |accessdate= 11 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nikolas Emerson died eight years later. The family refused to reveal whether the death was AIDS related.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.boston.com/news/globe/obituaries/articles/2006/03/10/nikolas_emerson_11_case_led_to_legal_fight_over_hiv/ |title= Nikolas Emerson, 11; Case led to legal fight over HIV |accessdate= 11 June 2009 |date= 10 March 2006 |last= Harkavy |first= J |newspaper= Boston Globe}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Africa===
In 2000, South Africa's President [[Thabo Mbeki]] invited several HIV/AIDS denialists to join his Presidential AIDS Advisory Panel.&lt;ref name="vv"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0027,schoofs2,16283,1.html |title=Debating the obvious: Inside the South African government's controversial AIDS panel |last=Schoofs |first=M |date=5 July 2000 |work=[[Village Voice]] |access-date=11 June 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080617232941/https://www.villagevoice.com/news/0027,schoofs2,16283,1.html |archive-date=17 June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; A response named the [[Durban Declaration]] was issued affirming the [[scientific consensus]] that HIV causes AIDS:

: "The declaration has been signed by over 5,000 people, including Nobel Prize winners, directors of leading research institutions, scientific academies and medical societies, notably the US National Academy of Sciences, the US Institute of Medicine, Max Planck institutes, the European Molecular Biology Organization, the Pasteur Institute in Paris, the Royal Society of London, the AIDS Society of India and the National Institute of Virology in South Africa. In addition, thousands of individual scientists and doctors have signed, including many from the countries bearing the greatest burden of the epidemic. Signatories are of MD, PhD level or equivalent, although scientists working for commercial companies were asked not to sign."&lt;ref name=durbandec/&gt;

In 2008, [[University of Cape Town]] researcher [[Nicoli Nattrass]], and later that year a group of Harvard scientists led by Zimbabwean physician [[Pride Chigwedere]] each independently estimated that Thabo Mbeki's denialist policies led to the early deaths of more than 330,000 South Africans.&lt;ref name=chigwedere/&gt;&lt;ref name=NattrassAA/&gt; [[Barbara Hogan]], the health minister appointed by Mbeki's successor, voiced shame over the studies' findings and stated: "The era of denialism is over completely in South Africa."&lt;ref name="nyt-dugger"/&gt;

In 2009, Fraser McNeill wrote an article arguing that South Africa's reluctance to openly address HIV/AIDS resulted from social conventions that prevent people from talking about causes of death in certain situations, rather than from Mbeki's denialist views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=McNeill |first= FG |date= 1 July 2009 |title=‘Condoms Cause Aids’: Poison, Prevention and Denial in Venda, South Africa |url=https://academic.oup.com/afraf/article/108/432/353/113835/Condoms-Cause-Aids-Poison-Prevention-and-Denial-in |journal=African Affairs |volume=108 |issue=432 |pages=353–70 |doi=10.1093/afraf/adp020 |issn=0001-9909}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, political scientist Anthony Butler has argued that "South African HIV/AIDS policy can be explained without appeals to leadership irrationality or wider cultural denialism."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Butler |first=A |date= 1 October 2005 |title=South Africa’s HIV/AIDS policy, 1994–2004: How can it be explained? |url=https://academic.oup.com/afraf/article/104/417/591/32035/South-Africa-s-HIV-AIDS-policy-1994-2004-How-can |journal=African Affairs |volume=104 |issue=417 |pages=591–614 |doi=10.1093/afraf/adi036 |issn=0001-9909}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2016 [[Aaron Motsoaledi]], the Health Minister of South Africa, wrote an article for the Centre for Health Journalism in which he criticised past South African leaders for their denialism, describing it as an "unlucky moment" in a country which has since become a leader in treatment and prevention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://bhekisisa.org/article/2016-07-15-aids2016-health-minister-aaron-motsoaledi-admits-that-key-leaders-were-in-denial |title= #AIDS2016: Health Minister Aaron Motsoaledi admits that 'key leaders were in denial' |last= Motsoaledi |first= Aaron |date= 20 July 2016 |publisher= Bhekisisa: Center for Health Journalism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Denialists' claims and scientific evidence==
{{See also|Duesberg hypothesis}}

Although members of the HIV/AIDS denialist community are united by their disagreement with the scientific finding that HIV is the cause of AIDS, the specific positions taken by various groups differ. Denialists claim many incompatible things: HIV does not exist; HIV has not been adequately isolated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Turner |first= V |year= 1999 |url= http://www.virusmyth.com/aids/hiv/vtcorweiss.htm |title= E-Mail Correspondence Between Val Turner and Robin Weiss |work= virusmyth.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; HIV does not fulfill [[Koch's postulates]],&lt;ref name=duesbergpnas&gt;{{cite journal |last= Duesberg |first= P |title= Human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: Correlation but not causation |journal= [[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume= 86 |issue= 3 |pages= 755–64 |year= 1989 |pmid= 2644642 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.86.3.755 |pmc= 286556 |bibcode= 1989PNAS...86..755D}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[HIV test]]ing is inaccurate,&lt;ref name= "Papadopulos1993"/&gt; and that [[antibody|antibodies]] to HIV neutralize the virus and render it harmless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.healtoronto.com/10reasons.html |work= HealToronto.com |title= 10 Scientific Reasons Why HIV Cannot Cause AIDS |accessdate= 28 September 2006 |deadurl= yes |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20060806081324/http://www.healtoronto.com/10reasons.html |archive-date= 6 August 2006 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Suggested alternative causes of AIDS include [[recreational drug use|recreational drugs]], [[malnutrition]], and the very [[antiretroviral|antiretroviral drugs]] used to treat the syndrome.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Duesberg |first1= P |last2= Koehnlein |first2= C |last3= Rasnick |first3= D |title= The chemical bases of the various AIDS epidemics: Recreational drugs, anti-viral chemotherapy and malnutrition |journal= [[Journal of Biosciences]] |volume= 28 |issue= 4 |pages= 383–412 |year= 2003 |pmid= 12799487 |doi= 10.1007/BF02705115}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Such claims have been examined extensively in the [[peer-review]]ed medical and scientific literature; a [[scientific consensus]] has arisen that denialist claims have been convincingly disproved, and that HIV does indeed cause AIDS.&lt;ref name=niaid /&gt;&lt;ref name=cdcfacts&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.cdc.gov/hiv/basics/index.html | title = Basic Information about HIV and AIDS | publisher  =[[Centers for Disease Control]] | date = 11 August 2010  | accessdate =4 February 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the cases cited by Duesberg where HIV "cannot be isolated", [[PCR]] or other techniques demonstrate the presence of the virus,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= O'Brien |first1= SJ |last2= Goedert |first2= JJ |title= HIV causes AIDS: Koch's postulates fulfilled |journal= [[Current Opinion (Elsevier)|Current Opinion in Immunology]] |volume= 8 |issue=  5 |pages= 613–8 |year= 1996 |pmid= 8902385 |doi= 10.1016/S0952-7915(96)80075-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; and denialist claims of HIV test inaccuracy result from an incorrect or outdated understanding of how HIV antibody testing is performed and interpreted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.kaisernetwork.org/health_cast/uploaded_files/081306_ias_sat_journalism.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616224514/http://www.kaisernetwork.org/health_cast/uploaded_files/081306_ias_sat_journalism.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=16 June 2007 |title=HIV Science and Responsible Journalism |date=13 August 2006 |accessdate=17 December 2008 |publisher=[[XVI International AIDS Conference]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.aidstruth.org/denialism/denialists/giraldo-immunoassays | title=How Immunoassays Work: The Curious Case of AIDS Denialist Roberto Giraldo and his Ignorance of the Basics | publisher=Aidstruth.org | date=16 May 2008 | accessdate=17 December 2008 | last=Moore | first=John | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100706160310/https://www.aidstruth.org/denialism/denialists/giraldo-immunoassays | archivedate=6 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding Koch's postulates, ''[[New Scientist]]'' reported: "It is debatable how appropriate it is to focus on a set of principles devised for bacterial infections in a century when viruses had not yet been discovered. HIV does, however, meet Koch's postulates as long as they are not applied in a ridiculously stringent way".  The author then demonstrated how each postulate has been met –  the suspected cause is strongly associated with the disease, the suspected pathogen can be both isolated and spread outside the host, and when the suspected pathogen is transmitted to a new and uninfected host, that host develops the disease.&lt;ref name=niaid /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.newscientist.com/article/dn17326-five-myths-about-hiv-and-aids.html | title =  Five myths about HIV and AIDS | first = J | last = Steinberg | authorlink = Jonny Steinberg | work= [[New Scientist]] | date = 23 June 2009 | accessdate =4 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter was proven in a number of tragic accidents, including an instance when multiple scientific technicians with no other known risk factors were exposed to concentrated HIV virus in a laboratory accident, and transmission by a dentist to patients, the majority of whom had no other known risk factor or source of exposure except the same dentist in common.&lt;ref name=niaid /&gt; In 2010, Chigwedere and [[Max Essex]] demonstrated in the [[medical journal]] ''[[AIDS and Behavior]]'' that HIV as the cause of AIDS fulfills both Koch's postulates and the [[Bradford Hill criteria]] for causality.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chigwedere|first1=P |last2=Essex |first2=M |url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10461-009-9654-7|title=AIDS Denialism and Public Health Practice|journal=AIDS and Behavior|date=8 January 2010|volume=14|issue=2|pages=237–47|doi=10.1007/s10461-009-9654-7|pmid=20058063}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Early denialist arguments held that the HIV/AIDS paradigm was flawed because it had not led to effective treatments. However, the introduction of [[highly active antiretroviral therapy]] in the mid-1990s and dramatic improvements in survival of HIV/AIDS patients reversed this argument, as these treatments were based directly on anti-viral activity and the HIV/AIDS paradigm.&lt;ref name="treatment-studies"&gt;Major studies confirming the benefits and effectiveness of modern anti-HIV therapy include, but are not limited to:

In a 2010 article on [[conspiracy theory|conspiracy theories]] in science, [[Ted Goertzel]] lists HIV/AIDS denialism as an example where scientific findings are being disputed on irrational grounds. He describes proponents as relying on [[rhetoric]], appeal to fairness, and the right to a dissenting opinion rather than on evidence.  They frequently invoke the [[meme]] of a "courageous independent scientist resisting orthodoxy", invoking the name of persecuted physicist and astronomer [[Galileo Galilei]].&lt;ref name = Goertzel&gt;{{Cite journal| last1 = Goertzel | first1 = T| title = Conspiracy theories in science| journal = EMBO Reports| volume = 11| issue = 7| pages = 493–499| year = 2010| pmid = 20539311| pmc = 2897118| doi = 10.1038/embor.2010.84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Regarding this comparison, Goertzel states:
{{quote|...being a dissenter from orthodoxy is not difficult; the hard part is actually having a better theory.

==Denialist community==
Denialists often use their critique of the link between HIV and AIDS to promote [[alternative medicine]] as a cure, and attempt to convince HIV-infected individuals to avoid [[Antiretroviral drug|ARV therapy]] in favour of vitamins, massage, yoga and other unproven treatments.&lt;ref name="nattrass-2007-si"/&gt;  Despite this promotion, denialists will often downplay any association with alternative therapies, and attempt to portray themselves as "dissidents".  An article in the ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'' stated:
{{quote|AIDS denialists [prefer] to characterize themselves as brave "dissidents" attempting to engage a hostile medical/industrial establishment in genuine scientific "debate." They complain that their attempts to raise questions and pose alternative hypotheses have been unjustly rejected or ignored at the cost of scientific progress itself...Given their resistance to all evidence to the contrary, today's AIDS dissidents are more aptly referred to as AIDS denialists.&lt;ref name="nattrass-2007-si"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Nattrass | first = N | year = 2007 | title = AIDS Denialism vs. Science | volume = 31 | issue = 5 | url = http://www.csicop.org/si/show/aids_denialism_vs._science/ | journal = [[Skeptical Inquirer]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Several scientists have been associated with HIV/AIDS denialism, although they have not themselves studied AIDS or HIV.&lt;ref name="NewScientist"/&gt; One of the most famous and influential is Duesberg, professor of molecular and cell biology at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], who since 1987 has disputed that the scientific evidence shows that HIV causes AIDS.&lt;ref name=duesberg1987/&gt; Other scientists associated with HIV/AIDS denialism include biochemists [[David Rasnick]] and [[Harvey Bialy]].

HIV/AIDS denialism has received some support from [[conservatism in the United States|political conservatives]] in the United States. Duesberg's work has been published in ''[[Policy Review]]'', a journal once published by [[The Heritage Foundation]] but later acquired by the [[Hoover Institution]],{{sfn|Epstein|1996|pp=131–158}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.duesberg.com/about/pdpolicy.html |last1= Duesberg |first1= P |first2= BJ |last2= Ellison |title= Is the AIDS virus a science fiction |magazine=[[Policy Review]] |date=Summer 1990 |pages= 40–51}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.duesberg.com/about/pdpolicyrep.html |last1= Duesberg | first1= P |first2= BJ |last2= Ellison |title= Is HIV the cause of AIDS? |magazine= [[Policy Review]] |date=Fall 1990 |pages= 70–83}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by [[Regnery Publishing]].

In a follow-up article in ''[[Skeptical Inquirer]]'',&lt;ref name=nattrass2012&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Nattrass |first1= N |title= The social and symbolic power of AIDS denialism |journal= Skeptical Inquirer |volume= 36 |date=July–August 2012 |pages=34–8 |publisher= [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]] |url= http://www.csicop.org/si/show/the_social_and_symbolic_power_of_aids_denialism}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nattrass overviewed the prominent members of the HIV/AIDS denialist community and discussed the reasons of the intractable staying power of HIV/AIDS denialism in spite of scientific and medical consensus supported by over two decades of evidence. She observed that despite being a disparate group of people with very different background and professions, the HIV/AIDS denialists self-organize to fill four important roles:&lt;ref name=nattrass2012/&gt;
* "Hero scientists" to provide scientific legitimacy: Most notably Duesberg who plays the central role of HIV/AIDS denialism from the beginning. Others include [[David Rasnick]], [[Étienne de Harven]], and [[Kary Mullis]] whose [[Nobel Prize]] makes him symbolically important.
* "Cultropreneurs" to offer fake cures in place of [[Management of HIV/AIDS|antiretroviral therapy]]: [[Matthias Rath]], [[Gary Null]], Michael Ellner, and Roberto Giraldo all promote [[alternative medicine]] and remedies with a dose of conspiracy theories in the form of books, healing products, radio shows and counseling services.
* HIV-positive "living icons" to provide proof of concept by appearing to live healthily without antiretroviral therapy: [[Christine Maggiore]] was and still is the most important icon in the HIV/AIDS denialist movement despite the fact that she died of AIDS related complications in 2008.
* "Praise singers": sympathetic journalists and filmmakers who publicize the movement with uncritical and favorable opinion. They include journalists [[Celia Farber]], Liam Scheff and Neville Hodgkinson; filmmakers [[House of Numbers (2009 film)|Brent Leung]] and  [[The Other Side of AIDS|Robert Leppo]].
Some of them had overlapping roles as board members of Rethinking AIDS and [[Alive and Well AIDS Alternatives]], were involved in the film ''[[House of Numbers (2009 film)|House of Numbers]]'', ''[[The Other Side of AIDS]]'' or on [[Thabo Mbeki]]'s AIDS Advisory Panel.
Nattrass argued that HIV/AIDS denialism gains social traction through powerful community-building effects where these four organized characters form "a symbiotic connection between AIDS denialism and alternative healing modalities" and they are "facilitated by a shared conspiratorial stance toward HIV science".&lt;ref name=nattrass2012/&gt;

===Former denialists===
Several of the few prominent scientists who once voiced doubts about HIV/AIDS have since changed their views and accepted the fact that HIV plays a role in causing AIDS, in response to an accumulation of newer studies and data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.aegis.com/topics/mdelaney.html |title= HIV, AIDS, and the distortion of science |first= M |last= Delaney |accessdate= 9 June 2011 |year= 2005 |magazine= [[Focus (Christian magazine)|Focus]] |volume= 15 |issue= 6 |pages= 1–6 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110604155409/http://www.aegis.com/topics/mdelaney.html |archivedate= 4 June 2011 |deadurl= yes |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Root-Bernstein, author of ''Rethinking AIDS: The Tragic Cost of Premature Consensus'' and formerly a critic of the causative role of HIV in AIDS, has since distanced himself from the HIV/AIDS denialist movement, saying, "Both the camp that says HIV is a pussycat and the people who claim AIDS is all HIV are wrong...The denialists make claims that are clearly inconsistent with existing studies."&lt;ref name=poz&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.poz.com/articles/451_2788.shtml |title= Dead Certain? |last= Lederer |first= B |magazine= [[POZ (magazine)|POZ]] |date= 1 April 2006 |accessdate= 31 October 2006 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20061113150749/http://www.poz.com/articles/451_2788.shtml |archivedate= 13 November 2006 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; | deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Joseph Sonnabend]], who until the late 1990s regarded the issue of AIDS causation as unresolved, has reconsidered in light of the success of newer antiretroviral drugs, stating, "The evidence now strongly supports a role for HIV… Drugs that can save your life can also under different circumstances kill you. This is a distinction that denialists do not seem to understand."&lt;ref name=poz/&gt; Sonnabend has also criticized HIV/AIDS denialists for falsely implying that he supports their position, saying:
{{Quotation|Some individuals who believe that HIV plays no role at all in AIDS have implied that I support their misguided views on AIDS causation by including inappropriate references to me in their literature and on their web sites. Before HIV was discovered and its association with AIDS established, I held the entirely appropriate view that the cause of AIDS was then unknown. I have successfully treated hundreds of AIDS patients with antiretroviral medications, and have no doubt that HIV plays a necessary role in this disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aidstruth.org/denialism/sonnabend |title= Statement by Joseph Sonnabend, M.D. |work= aidstruth.org |accessdate= 15 February 2011 |last1= Sonnabend |first1= J |deadurl= yes |archive-date= 17 May 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110517101454/http://www.aidstruth.org/denialism/sonnabend |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

A former denialist wrote in the ''[[Journal of Medical Ethics]]'' in 2004:
{{Quotation|The group [of denialists] regularly points to a substantial number of scientists supportive of its agenda to re-evaluate the HIV/AIDS hypothesis. Some of those members still listed are people who have been dead for a number of years. While it is correct that these people supported the objective of a scientific re-evaluation of the HIV/AIDS link when they were alive, it is clearly difficult to ascertain what these people would have made of the scientific developments and the accumulation of evidence for HIV as the crucial causative agent in AIDS, which has occurred in the years after their deaths.&lt;ref name=jme&gt;{{cite journal |last=Schüklenk |first= U |title= Professional responsibilities of biomedical scientists in public discourse |journal= J Med Ethics |volume= 30 |issue= 1 |pages=53–60; discussion 61–2 |year= 2004 |pmid= 14872076 |pmc= 1757140 |url= http://jme.bmj.com/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=14872076 |doi=10.1136/jme.2003.002980}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Death of HIV-positive denialists ===
In 2007, aidstruth.org, a website run by HIV researchers to counter denialist claims,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Cohen |first= J |title= HIV/AIDS.

For example, the editors of the magazine ''[[Continuum (magazine)|Continuum]]'' consistently denied the existence of HIV/AIDS. The magazine shut down after both editors died of AIDS-related causes.&lt;ref name=NewHumanist&gt;{{cite news |url= http://newhumanist.org.uk/2165/how-to-spot-an-aids-denialist |title= How to spot an AIDS denialist |magazine= [[New Humanist]] |date=November 2009 |last= Kalichman |first= S | authorlink = Seth Kalichman}}&lt;/ref&gt; In each case, the HIV/AIDS denialist community attributed the deaths to unknown causes, secret drug use, or stress rather than HIV/AIDS.&lt;ref name="denialists-who-have-died"/&gt;&lt;ref name=jme/&gt; Similarly, several HIV-positive former dissidents have reported being ostracized by the AIDS-denialist community after they developed AIDS and decided to pursue effective [[antiretroviral]] treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.aegis.org/news/misc/2000/bg000201.html |title= Bad science: They once thought HIV was harmless.

In 2008, activist [[Christine Maggiore]] died at the age of 52 while under a doctor's care for pneumonia. Maggiore, mother of two children, had founded [[Alive &amp; Well AIDS Alternatives|an organisation]] to help other HIV-positive mothers avoid taking antiretroviral drugs that reduce the risk of HIV transmission from mother to child.&lt;ref name=LATimesArticle&gt;{{cite news |url= http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/24/local/me-eliza24 |title= A mother's denial, a daughter's death |newspaper= [[Los Angeles Times]] |date= 24 September 2005 |accessdate= 29 December 2008 |last1= Ornstein |first1=C |first2=D |last2= Costello | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20081222041314/http://articles.latimes.com/2005/sep/24/local/me-eliza24 |archivedate= 22 December 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt; |deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; After her three-year-old daughter died of [[AIDS-related pneumonia]] in 2005, Maggiore continued to believe that HIV is not the cause of AIDS, and she and her husband [[Robin Scovill]] sued [[Los Angeles County]] and others on behalf of their daughter's estate, for allegedly violating [[Eliza Scovill]]'s civil rights by releasing an autopsy report that listed her cause of death as [[AIDS-related pneumonia]].&lt;ref name=LATdeath/&gt; The litigants settled out of court, with the county paying Scovill $15,000 in March 2009, with no admission of wrongdoing.

=== Local community group denialism ===
'''Australia:''' In 2009 representing the [[Australian Vaccination-Skeptics Network]], President [[Meryl Dorey]] signed a petition claiming that "the AIDS industry and the media" had tricked the public and the media into believing that the HIV virus causes AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Panic Virus: Fear, Myth and the Vaccination Debate|publisher = Schwartz Publishing Pty, Limited|date = 2011-01-25|isbn = 9781921870118|language = en|first = Seth|last = Mnookin|edition= Australian|page = xx}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Canada:''' The Alberta Reappraising AIDS Society created the petition in March 2000 and has reportedly since attracted "2,951 doubters" representing groups and individuals through the globe. Signatories reportedly deny the theory "that Aids is heterosexually transmitted".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = HIV/AIDS Rethinkers|url = http://aras.ab.ca/rethinkers.php|website = Alberta Reappraising AIDS Society|date=March 16, 2000|access-date = 2016-02-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Impact beyond the scientific community==
AIDS-denialist claims have failed to attract support in the scientific community, where the evidence for the causative role of HIV in AIDS is considered conclusive. However, the movement has had a significant impact in the political sphere, culminating with former South African President [[Thabo Mbeki]]'s embrace of AIDS-denialist claims.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gray|first=A |title=''The Politics of AIDS Denialism: South Africa's Failure to Respond'' - By Pieter Fourie and Melissa Meyer|journal=Political Studies Review|volume=10|issue=2|page=309 |doi=10.1111/j.1478-9302.2012.00269_2.x |type= Book review|year=2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The resulting governmental refusal to provide effective anti-HIV treatment in South Africa has been blamed for hundreds of thousands of premature AIDS-related deaths in South Africa.&lt;ref name="nyt-dugger"&gt;{{cite news |newspaper= The New York Times |first= C |last= Dugger |date= 25 November 2008 |accessdate= 17 December 2008 |title= Study cites toll of AIDS policy in South Africa |url= https://www.nytimes.com/2008/11/26/world/africa/26aids.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===North America and Europe===
Skepticism about HIV being the cause of AIDS began almost immediately after the discovery of HIV was announced. One of the earliest prominent skeptics was the journalist [[John Lauritsen]], who argued in his writings for the ''[[New York Native]]'' that AIDS was caused by [[Poppers|amyl nitrite poppers]], and that the government had conspired to hide the truth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.virusmyth.com/aids/data2/jlbio.htm |title= Biography of John Lauritsen |work= virusmyth.com |accessdate= 7 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lauritsen's ''The AIDS War'' was published in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Lauritsen |first= John |title= The AIDS War |publisher= Pagan Press |location= New York |year= 1993 |isbn=0-943742-08-0 |page= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Scientific literature====
The publication of Duesberg's first AIDS paper in 1987 provided visibility for denialist claims. Shortly afterwards, the journal ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' reported that Duesberg's remarks had won him "a large amount of media attention, particularly in the gay press where he is something of a hero."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Booth |first= W |title= A rebel without a cause of AIDS |journal= Science |volume= 239 |issue= 4847 |pages= 1485–8 |year= 1988 |pmid= 3281251 |doi= 10.1126/science.3281251 |url= http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/reprint/239/4847/1485 |bibcode= 1988Sci...239.1485B}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Duesberg's support in the [[gay community]] diminished as he made a series of statements perceived as [[Homophobia|homophobic]]; in an interview with ''[[The Village Voice]]'' in 1988, Duesberg stated his belief that the AIDS epidemic was "caused by a lifestyle that was criminal twenty years ago."&lt;ref name=epstein&gt;{{cite book |last= Epstein |first= S |title= Impure Science: AIDS, Activism, and the Politics of Knowledge |publisher= University of California Press |location= Berkeley |year= 1996 |isbn=0520202333 |page= 118 |ref= {{Harvid|Epstein|1996}}}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the following few years, others became skeptical of the HIV theory as researchers initially failed to produce an effective treatment or vaccine for AIDS.&lt;ref name="Burkett1995"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burkett|first=Elinor |title=The Gravest Show on Earth: America in the Age of AIDS|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YXLP4k7spJYC|year=1995|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|isbn=978-0-395-74537-3|pages=53–76|chapter=Ch. 2: Evidence to the Contrary}}&lt;/ref&gt; Journalists such as Neville Hodgkinson and [[Celia Farber]] regularly promoted denialist ideas in the American and British media; several television documentaries were also produced to increase awareness of the alternative viewpoint.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.virusmyth.net/aids/censorship.htm |title= Censorship |work= virusmyth.com |accessdate= 2 June 2006 |deadurl= yes |archive-date= 15 October 2009 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20091015032105/http://www.virusmyth.com/aids/censorship.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1992–1993, ''[[The Sunday Times]]'', where Hodgkinson served as scientific editor, ran a series of articles arguing that the AIDS epidemic in Africa was a myth. These articles stressed Duesberg's claims and argued that antiviral therapy was ineffective, HIV testing unreliable, and that AIDS was not a threat to heterosexuals. The ''Sunday Times'' coverage was heavily criticized as slanted, misleading, and potentially dangerous; the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' took the unusual step of printing a 1993 editorial calling the paper's coverage of HIV/AIDS "seriously mistaken, and probably disastrous."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1993/12/10/world/british-paper-and-science-journal-clash-on-aids.html |title= British paper and science journal clash on AIDS |last= Schmidt |first= WE |newspaper= The New York Times |date= 10 December 1993 |accessdate= 25 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Finding difficulty in publishing his arguments in the scientific literature, Duesberg exercised his right as a member of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] to publish in ''[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]]'' (''PNAS'') without going through the [[peer review]] process. However, Duesberg's paper raised a "red flag" at the journal and was submitted by the editor for non-binding review. All of the reviewers found major flaws in Duesberg's paper; the reviewer specifically chosen by Duesberg noted the presence of "misleading arguments", "nonlogical statements", "misrepresentations", and political overtones.&lt;ref name=sciencebooth&gt;{{cite journal |last=Booth |first= W |title= AIDS paper raises red flag at PNAS |journal= Science |volume= 243 |issue= 4892 |page= 733 |year=1989 |pmid=2916121|doi=10.1126/science.2916121|bibcode = 1989Sci...243..733B }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ultimately, the editor of ''PNAS'' acquiesced to publication,&lt;ref name=pnas1989&gt;{{cite journal |last=Duesberg |first= PH |title=Human immunodeficiency virus and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome: Correlation but not causation |journal=[[Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America]] |volume= 86 |issue= 3 |pages= 755–64 |year= 1989 |pmid= 2644642 |doi= 10.1073/pnas.86.3.755 |pmc= 286556 |bibcode= 1989PNAS...86..755D}}&lt;/ref&gt; writing to Duesberg: "If you wish to make these unsupported, vague, and prejudicial statements in print, so be it. But I cannot see how this would be convincing to any scientifically trained reader."&lt;ref name=sciencebooth/&gt;

HIV/AIDS denialists often resort to [[special pleading]] to support their assertion, arguing for different causes of AIDS in different locations and subpopulations. In North America, AIDS is blamed on the health effects of unprotected anal sex and poppers on homosexual men, an argument which does not account for AIDS in drug-free heterosexual women who deny participating in anal sex.  In this case, HIV/AIDS denialists claim the women are having anal sex but refuse to disclose it. In [[haemophilia]]c North American children who contracted AIDS from blood transfusions, the haemophilia itself or its treatment is claimed to cause AIDS.  In Africa, AIDS is blamed on poor nutrition and sanitation due to poverty.  For wealthy populations in South Africa with adequate nutrition and sanitation, it is claimed that the antiretroviral drugs used to treat AIDS cause the condition.  In each case, the [[Occam's razor|most parsimonious explanation]] and uniting factor – HIV positive status – is ignored, as are the thousands of studies that converge on the common conclusion that AIDS is caused by HIV infection.{{sfn|Kalichman|2009}}

Haemophilia is considered the best test of the HIV-AIDS hypothesis by both denialists and AIDS researchers.  While Duesberg claims AIDS in haemophiliacs is caused by contaminated clotting factors and HIV is a harmless [[passenger virus]], this result is contradicted by large studies on haemophiliac patients who received contaminated blood.  A comparison of groups receiving high, medium and low levels of contaminated clotting factors found the death rates differed significantly depending on HIV status.  Of 396 HIV positive haemophiliacs followed between 1985 and 1993, 153 died.  The comparative figure for the HIV negative group was one out of 66, despite comparable doses of contaminated clotting factors.  A comparison of individuals receiving blood donations also supports the results; in 1994 there were 6888 individuals with AIDS who had their HIV infection traced to blood transfusions.  Since the introduction of HIV testing, the number of individuals whose AIDS status can be traced to blood transfusions was only 29 (as of 1994).&lt;ref name = CohenScience1994/&gt;

With the introduction of [[HAART|highly active antiretroviral therapy]] (HAART) in 1996–1997, the survival and general health of people with HIV improved significantly.&lt;ref name="treatment-studies"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last2 = May | first2 = MT | last3 = Sterne | first3 = JA | last4 = Costagliola | first4 = D | last5 = Sabin | first5 = CA | last6 = Phillips | first6 = AN | last7 = Justice | first7 = AC | last8 = Dabis | first8 = F | last9 = Gill | first9 = J | last10 = Lundgren | first10 = J | last11 = Hogg | first11 = RS | last12 = De Wolf | first12 = F | last13 = Fätkenheuer | first13 = G | last14 = Staszewski | first14 = S | last15 = d'Arminio Monforte | first15 = A | last16 = Egger | first16 = M | author1 = Antiretroviral Therapy (ART) Cohort Collaboration |display-authors= 2 | title = HIV treatment response and prognosis in Europe and North America in the first decade of highly active antiretroviral therapy: A collaborative analysis | doi = 10.1016/S0140-6736(06)69152-6 | journal = The Lancet | volume = 368 | issue = 9534 | pages = 451–458 | year = 2006 | pmid = 16890831 | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; The positive response to treatment with anti-HIV medication cemented the scientific acceptance of the HIV/AIDS paradigm, and led several prominent HIV/AIDS denialists to accept the causative role of HIV.&lt;ref name=jme/&gt;&lt;ref name=poz/&gt; Finding their arguments increasingly discredited by the scientific community, denialists took their message to the popular press. A former denialist wrote:{{Quotation|Scientists among the HIV dissidents used their academic credentials and academic affiliations to generate interest, sympathy, and allegiances in lay audiences. They were not professionally troubled about recruiting lay people—who were clearly unable to evaluate the scientific validity or otherwise of their views—to their cause.&lt;ref name=jme/&gt;}}
In addition to elements of the popular and alternative press, AIDS denialist ideas are propagated largely via the Internet.&lt;ref name=deer&gt;{{cite news |last= Deer |first= B |date= 21 February 2012 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/science/blog/2012/feb/21/death-denial-hiv-aids?INTCMP=SRCH |title= Death by denial: The campaigners who continue to deny HIV causes Aids |newspaper= [[The Guardian]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2007 article in ''[[PLoS Medicine]]'' noted:
{{Quotation|Because these denialist assertions are made in books and on the Internet rather than in the scientific literature, many scientists are either unaware of the existence of organized denial groups, or believe they can safely ignore them as the discredited fringe.

However, many members of the general public do not have the scientific background to critique the assertions put forth by these groups, and not only accept them but continue to propagate them.&lt;ref name=SmithNovella&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Smith |first1= TC |last2= Novella |first2= SP |title= HIV denial in the internet era |journal= [[PLOS Medicine]] |volume= 4 |issue= 8 |pages= e256 |date= August 2007 |pmid= 17713982 |doi= 10.1371/journal.pmed.0040256 |url= http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371/journal.pmed.0040256&amp;ct=1&amp;SESSID=3d4baa1a64e57d8ff33e9d41eb2335a1 |pmc= 1949841 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080506012410/http://medicine.plosjournals.org/perlserv/?request=get-document&amp;doi=10.1371%2Fjournal.pmed.0040256&amp;ct=1&amp;SESSID=a61d4ab73afe3389776361583d621ef6 |archivedate= 6 May 2008 |deadurl= no |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Lay opinion and AIDS-related behaviors====
AIDS activists have expressed concern that denialist arguments about HIV's harmlessness may be responsible for an upsurge in HIV infections. Denialist claims continue to exert a significant influence in some communities; a survey conducted at minority gay pride events in four American cities in 2005 found that 33% of attendees doubted that HIV caused AIDS.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hutchinson |first1= AB |last2= Begley |first2= EB |last3= Clark |first3= HA |last4= Boyett |first4= BC |last5= Jardine |first5= MA |last6= Kellerman |first6= SE |year= 2005 |url= http://www.aegis.org/conferences/nhivpc/2005/TP-011.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080102062252/http://www.aegis.org/conferences/nhivpc/2005/TP-011.html|archivedate=2 January 2008|title= Mistrust and conspiracy beliefs about HIV/AIDS among participants in minority gay pride events |journal= 2005 National HIV Prevention Conference |page= Abstract TP-011 |nopp=y|display-authors= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, a 2010 survey of 343 people living with HIV/AIDS found that one in five of them thought that there was no proof that HIV caused AIDS, and that HIV treatments did more harm than good.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kalichman|first1=SC|last2=Eaton|first2=L|last3=Cherry|first3=C|title='There is no proof that HIV causes AIDS': AIDS denialism beliefs among people living with HIV/AIDS|journal=[[Journal of Behavioral Medicine]]|date=December 2010|volume=33|issue=6|pages=432–40|doi=10.1007/s10865-010-9275-7|pmid=20571892|pmc=3015095}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Stephen Thomas, director of the [[University of Pittsburgh]] [[Center for Minority Health]], "people are focusing on the wrong thing.

===South Africa===
{{Main|HIV/AIDS denialism in South Africa}}
HIV/AIDS denialist claims have had a major political, social, and public health impact in South Africa. The government of then President [[Thabo Mbeki]] was sympathetic to the views of HIV/AIDS denialists, with critics charging that denialist influence was responsible for the slow and ineffective governmental response to the country's massive [[AIDS epidemic]].

Independent studies have arrived at almost identical estimates of the human costs of HIV/AIDS denialism in South Africa. According to a paper written by researchers from the [[Harvard School of Public Health]], between 2000 and 2005, more than 330,000 deaths and an estimated 35,000 infant HIV infections occurred "because of a failure to accept the use of available [antiretroviral drugs] to prevent and treat HIV/AIDS in a timely manner."&lt;ref name=chigwedere/&gt; Nicoli Nattrass of the [[University of Cape Town]] estimates that 343,000 excess AIDS-related deaths and 171,000 infections resulted from the Mbeki administration's policies, an outcome she refers to in the words of [[Peter Mandelson]] as "genocide by sloth".&lt;ref name=NattrassAA/&gt;

====Durban Declaration====
In 2000, when the [[International AIDS Conference]] was held in [[Durban]], Mbeki convened a Presidential Advisory Panel containing a number of HIV/AIDS denialists, including Duesberg and [[David Rasnick]].&lt;ref name=journaids&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.journaids.org/politicsofhiv.php |title= The Politics of HIV/AIDS in South Africa |accessdate= 26 February 2007 |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070702083352/http://journaids.org/politicsofhiv.php |archivedate= 2 July 2007 |work= JournAIDS |publisher= HIV &amp; AIDS Media Project}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Advisory Panel meetings were closed to the general press; an invited reporter from the ''[[Village Voice]]'' wrote that Rasnick advocated that HIV testing be legally banned and denied that he had seen "any evidence" of an AIDS catastrophe in South Africa, while Duesberg "gave a presentation so removed from African medical reality that it left several local doctors shaking their heads."&lt;ref name=vv/&gt;

In his address to the International AIDS Conference, Mbeki reiterated his view that HIV was not wholly responsible for AIDS, leading hundreds of delegates to walk out on his speech.&lt;ref name=Controversy&gt;{{cite news |url= http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/africa/826742.stm |title= Controversy dogs AIDS forum |work= BBC News |date= 10 July 2000 |accessdate= 26 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mbeki also sent a letter to a number of world leaders likening the mainstream AIDS research community to supporters of the [[apartheid]] regime.&lt;ref name=journaids/&gt; The tone and content of Mbeki's letter led diplomats in the U.S. to initially question whether it was a hoax.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0027,schoofs,16189,1.html | title=Proof positive: How African science has demonstrated that HIV causes AIDS | date=5–11 July 2000 | accessdate=20 April 2007 | last=Schoof | first=M | newspaper=[[Village Voice]] | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080208133805/http://www.villagevoice.com/news/0027,schoofs,16189,1.html | archivedate=8 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/52730299.html?dids=52730299:52730299&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;date=Apr+19%2C+2000&amp;author=Barton+Gellman&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post&amp;edition=&amp;startpage=A.01&amp;desc=S.+African+President+Escalates+AIDS+Feud |title= South African president escalates AIDS feud |first= B |last= Gellman |newspaper= [[Washington Post]] |date= 19 April 2000 |accessdate= 26 February 2007 |subscription=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

AIDS scientists and activists were dismayed at the president's behavior and responded with the [[Durban Declaration]], a document affirming that HIV causes AIDS, signed by over 5,000 scientists and physicians.&lt;ref name=durbandec/&gt;&lt;ref name=Controversy/&gt;

====Criticism of governmental response====
The former South African health minister [[Manto Tshabalala-Msimang]] also attracted heavy criticism, as she often promoted nutritional remedies such as garlic, lemons, [[beetroot]] and [[olive oil]], to people suffering from AIDS,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.health-e.org.za/news/article.php?uid=20031487 |title= Beetroot battle at world AIDS conference |first= A |last= Thom |website= Health-e.org.za |date= 21 August 2006 |accessdate= 9 March 2007 |deadurl= yes |archive-date= 23 August 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070823213634/http://www.health-e.org.za/news/article.php?uid=20031487}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.mg.co.za/articlepage.aspx?area=/breaking_news/breaking_news__national/&amp;articleid=280903 |title= 'Dr Beetroot' hits back at media over Aids exhibition |newspaper= Mail &amp; Guardian |last= Blandy |first= Fran |date= 16 August 2006 |deadurl= yes |archive-date= 4 January 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070104191247/http://www.mg.co.za/articlepage.aspx?area=%2Fbreaking_news%2Fbreaking_news__national%2F&amp;articleid=280903 |accessdate= 20 September 2006 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.aegis.com/news/sapa/2005/sa050604.html |title= Manto again angers AIDS activists |work= AEGIS.com |agency= South African Press Association |accessdate= 20 September 2006 |deadurl= yes |archive-date= 30 September 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070930183013/http://www.aegis.com/news/sapa/2005/sa050604.html |date= 8 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; while emphasizing possible toxicities of antiretroviral drugs, which she has referred to as "poison".&lt;ref name=asg&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aidstruth.org/nattrass.pdf |title=AIDS, science and governance |first=N |last=Nattrass |work=aidstruth.org |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060623094834/http://www.aidstruth.org/nattrass.pdf |archivedate=23 June 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[South African Medical Association]] has accused Tshabalala-Msimang of "confusing a vulnerable public".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url= http://www.samedical.org/article.asp?ArticleID=1844 |title= SAMA calls for end to misrepresentation on treatment of AIDS |date= 29 August 2006 |publisher= [[South African Medical Association]] |accessdate= 12 March 2007 |deadurl= yes |archive-date= 10 August 2007 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20070810234414/http://www.samedical.org/article.asp?ArticleID=1844}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2006, a group of over 80 scientists and academics called for "the immediate removal of Dr. Tshabalala-Msimang as minister of health and for an end to the disastrous, pseudoscientific policies that have characterized the South African government's response to HIV/AIDS."&lt;ref name=wpleonard&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2006/09/06/AR2006090600586.html |title= Scientists rip S.

Former South African president [[Thabo Mbeki]]'s government was widely criticized for delaying the rollout of programs to provide antiretroviral drugs to people with advanced HIV disease and to HIV-positive pregnant women. The national treatment program began only after the [[Treatment Action Campaign]] (TAC) brought a legal case against Government ministers, claiming they were responsible for the deaths of 600 HIV-positive people a day who could not access medication.&lt;ref name=journaids/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20061009025030/http://www.tac.org.za/Documents/MTCTCourtCase/Heywood.pdf |archive-date= 9 October 2006 |deadurl= yes |url= http://www.tac.org.za/Documents/MTCTCourtCase/Heywood.pdf |title= Current Developments: Preventing mother-to-child HIV transmission In South Africa: Background, strategies and outcomes of the Treatment Action Campaign case against the Minister Of Health |last= Heywood |first= M |date= 2003 |journal= South African Journal on Human Rights |via= tac.org.za |pages= 278–315}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Africa was one of the last countries in the region to begin such a treatment program, and roll-out has been much slower than planned.&lt;ref name=asg/&gt;

At the [[XVI International AIDS Conference]], [[Stephen Lewis]], UN special envoy for AIDS in Africa, attacked Mbeki's government for its slow response to the AIDS epidemic and reliance on denialist claims:
{{Quotation|It [South Africa] is the only country in Africa … whose government is still obtuse, dilatory and negligent about rolling out treatment… It is the only country in Africa whose government continues to promote theories more worthy of a lunatic fringe than of a concerned and compassionate state.&lt;ref name=wpleonard/&gt;}}

In 2002, Mbeki requested that HIV/AIDS denialists no longer use his name in their literature and stop signing documents with "Member of President Mbeki's AIDS Advisory Panel".&lt;ref name=journaids/&gt; This coincided with the South African government's statement accompanying its 2002 AIDS campaign, that "...in conducting this campaign, government's starting point is based on the premise that HIV causes AIDS".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.avert.org/aids-south-africa.htm |title= AIDS in South Africa: Treatment, transmission and the government |work= avert.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nonetheless, Mbeki himself continued to promote and defend AIDS-denialist claims. His loyalists attacked former President [[Nelson Mandela]] in 2002 when Mandela questioned the government's AIDS policy, and Mbeki attacked [[Malegapuru William Makgoba]], one of South Africa's leading scientists, as a racist defender of "Western science" for opposing HIV/AIDS denialism.&lt;ref name="nyt-dugger"/&gt;

In early 2005, former South African President Nelson Mandela announced that his son had died of complications of AIDS. Mandela's public announcement was seen as both an effort to combat the stigma associated with AIDS, and as a "political statement designed to… force the President [Mbeki] out of his denial."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,1015842,00.html |title= No place for denial |first= S |last= Robinson |magazine= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= 9 January 2005 |accessdate= 26 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/southafrica/story/0,13262,1384732,00.html?gusrc=rss |title= Mandela's eldest son dies of AIDS |first= T |last= Happold |newspaper= The Guardian |date= 6 January 2005 |accessdate= 9 March 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Post-Mbeki government in South Africa ====
In 2008, Mbeki was ousted from power and replaced as President of South Africa by [[Kgalema Motlanthe]]. On Motlanthe's first day in office, he removed [[Manto Tshabalala-Msimang]], the controversial health minister who had promoted AIDS-denialist claims and recommended garlic, beetroot, and lemon juice as treatments for AIDS. [[Barbara Hogan]], newly appointed as health minister, voiced shame at the Mbeki government's embrace of HIV/AIDS denialism and vowed a new course, stating: "The era of denialism is over completely in South Africa."&lt;ref name="nyt-dugger"/&gt;

The '''heavy-browed mouse opossum''' (''Marmosa andersoni''), or '''Anderson's mouse opossum''', is a species of [[opossum]] in the family [[Didelphidae]].&lt;ref name = MSW3&gt;{{MSW3 Didelphimorphia | id = 10400071 | page = 8}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[endemic]] to a restricted range in southern [[Peru]].&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt; This opossum inhabits forests; it is [[nocturnal]] and probably [[arboreal]].&lt;ref name=iucn/&gt;

==Description==

As only seven individuals have been observed, the species as a whole is limited in description. The dark grey fur on the upper parts is relatively long and tipped with reddish-brown, while the underside is paler.

Marmosa Andersoni: Anderson’s Mouse Possum. Accessed 14 December 2012. Available from: http://eol.org/pages/290123/details&lt;/ref&gt; Anderson's mouse opossum has large thin ears, providing acute hearing. The tail, which is longer than the head and body, is furry at the base, with bristles that become longer and more slender towards the tip.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;ARKive&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;eol&lt;/ref&gt; Each foot has five digits and the big toe on the hindfoot is opposable, which, along with its prehensile tail, makes Anderson's mouse opossums well adapted for a life in the trees.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==Habitat==

Little is known about the ecology of this species. It is nocturnal and may be arboreal. The diet of Marmosa consists largely of insects and fruits but also lizards, bird eggs and small rodents. The second locality where was captured this species is a mixture of forest and bamboo.&lt;ref name="Solari"&gt;Solari, S. and Pine, R.H. (2008) Rediscovery and redescription of Marmosa (Stegomarmosa) andersoni Pine (Mammalia: Didelphimorphia: Didelphidae), an endemic Peruvian mouse opossum, with a reassessment of its affinities. Zootaxa, 1756: 49 - 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Range==

Anderson's mouse opossum is known from only three localities, within a narrow strip along the base of the Andes, in Cusco, and southern Peru.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"&gt;iucn&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Solari&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reproduction==

Anderson's mouse opossum is known only from one individual collected in 1954,&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; and several more specimens caught in the late 1990s,&lt;ref&gt;Solari&lt;/ref&gt; and thus very little is known about the biology of this incredibly rare animal. However, much can be deduced from studies of closely related species. It is likely to be nocturnal, and spend most of its time in trees.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt; Like all marsupials, gestation is probably short, with females' giving birth to poorly developed young and most of the development taking place during lactation.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt; It is likely that reproduction is similar to that of ''Marmosa robinsoni'', which gives birth to 6 to 14 young after a gestation period of just 14 days. The tiny young, measuring only up to 12 millimeters, attach themselves to the mother's mammae where they may remain for around 30 days.&lt;ref name="O'Connell"&gt;O'Connell, M.A. (1983) Marmosa robinsoni. Mammalian Species, 203: 1 - 6.&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike many marsupials, female mouse opossums do not possess a pouch to protect the young as they develop. The young are so undeveloped their eyes do not open until 39 to 40 days. It is likely that the young are completely weaned after around 65 days, and they may have an incredibly short life span of only one year. Marmosa species build nests for shelter, or use abandoned bird nests, holes in trees, or banana stalks. These nest sites are unlikely to be permanent; rather, the opossum will use whatever site is available as the sun begins to rise. Like ''M. robinsoni'', it is likely that Anderson's mouse opossum is insectivorous, with fruit also playing an important role in the diet.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connell&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conservation==

There are no major threats. In the one Western locality, there are natural gas fields in the Camisea region, which are being extracted; however, this is localized. Within the projected range, there is not a high rate of deforestation. In the vicinity of the eastern locality, there are threats including expanding coca crop.&lt;ref name="ReferenceC"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="10787">'''Historical metrology''' is the science that is dealing with the fundamental units of measurement, systems of units formerly in use in various countries, and the development of monetary units throughout their history.

==Antiquarianism movement==
The interest for historical metrology began by the early antiquarianism movement in Europe during 16th -17th centuries, when studies of the measurement systems in various ancient cultures became common, e.g. De Mensuris et ponderibus Romanis et Graecis, published in 1533 by [[Georgius Agricola]] (1494–1555). From the late 18th century and throughout the 19th century a plethora of books, with the aims to collate and clarify the relationships between different measurement systems and compile systems used in ancient cultures as well as in modern time, were published.

==Research efforts==
Research efforts were later also used to investigate measurement system in certain cultures or countries. Here it is appropriate to mention Hultsch,&lt;ref&gt;Hultsch, Friedrich Otto. Metrologicorum scriptorium reliquiae, collegit, recensuit, partim nunc primum edidit Fridericus Hultsch. 2 volumes. 1864/1866. (Reprinted 1971 by B. G. Teubner, Stuttgart.) and Hultsch, Friedrich Otto. Griechische und Römische Metrologie. 2nd ed. Berlin: Weidmann, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt; who published two monumental works, Griechische und römische Metrologie (1862) and Metrologicorum scriptorium reliquiae, collegit, recensuit, partim nunc primum edidit Fridericus Hultsch (1864/66).

==Published reports==
For some countries, principal divisions of executive governments have published reports that compile formerly used weights and measures. For example, this has been done for Bolivia, Great Britain, Costa Rica, Mexico, Portugal, Spain, Tanzania and the United States. In 1954, 1955,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |ref={{harvid|UN|1955}} |title=World Weights and Measures: Handbook for Statisticians |url=https://catalog.hathitrust.org/Record/001478405 |series=ST/STAT/SER. M/21, UN Publication No. 1955.XVII.2 |publisher=Statistical Office of the United Nations |location=New York |date=1955 }}.&lt;/ref&gt; and 1966, the United Nation compiled reports that were aimed at giving an overview of the non-metric units then in use in different parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations, Economic Commission for Asia and the Far East.

The book addresses the myriad units of measurement that have arisen through the ages, from weights used by ancient cultures to the scientific units of the modern world.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.springer.com/gb/book/9783319575964&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Horometry''' is the [[art]], practice or method by which time is measured in [[hour]]s or by smaller units. By this account, a "[[horometer (instrument)|horometer]]" ({{lang-el|hour + -meter}}) is an instrument that measures time.

'''''Hot Dog''''' is a Saturday morning documentary series for children, seen on [[NBC]] from September 12, 1970 to September 4, 1971. Created by [[Frank Buxton]] and co-produced by Buxton and [[Lee Mendelson]], the program was notable for its hosts&amp;nbsp;– [[Jo Anne Worley]], comedian [[Jonathan Winters]] and writer and actor [[Woody Allen]]. The pilot, televised on March 28, 1970, starred Worley, Allen and [[Tom Smothers]], who was replaced with Winters when the show became a series.

Based on Buxton's travels as a comedian (and later, as host of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] series, ''Discovery''), which took him on tours to various factories, ''Hot Dog'' explained, in a humorous manner, how we do things (such as snore) and how things were made (such as the eponymous hot dogs and their buns, plus condiments like mustard).

Seventy topics were covered during the course of this series, which lasted thirteen episodes and rerun the rest of the season. NBC won a Peabody award for the series in 1970.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.peabody.uga.edu/winners/winners_1970s.php&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the music in this series was performed by [[The Youngbloods]].

==Syndication and alternate versions==
Reruns of ''Hot Dog'' were [[television syndication|syndicated]] during the 1977–1978 television season, at a time when Allen had firmly established himself as a motion picture star, director, and writer. Portions of ''Hot Dog'' were also seen on a local [[KNBC]] children's program in [[Los Angeles]], ''[[That's Cat]]'', which debuted in 1976.

In 1971 the Individual topic segments were sold to schools on 16mm film.

The book is an overview of what lead to the creation of the X Prize, and the running of that first X Prize. Profiles of all the major players in the X Prize saga are included in the book. It chronologically starts with the influences that weighed upon Peter Diamandis, and his progression into the space industry. It also covers the process to get funding, rejections, and the arrival of the Ansaris, becoming title sponsors. The book surveys several of the teams that entered into the competition to win the Ansari X Prize. The team that is focused on most is that which won the X Prize in 2004, the one headed by Paul Allen and Burt Rutan, of SpaceShipOne. The book ends with an epilogue about [[Richard Branson]]'s [[Virgin Galactic]] scooping up the SpaceShipOne technology, and the spaceplane itself ending up in the [[Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum]]. The book includes a preface by Richard Branson, and an afterword by [[Stephen Hawking]].&lt;ref name=TSR-2016-10-03&gt; {{cite magazine |url= http://www.thespacereview.com/article/3071/1 |title= Review: How to Make a Spaceship |author= Jeff Foust |date= 3 October 2016 |publisher= The Space Review }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYJB-HTMASS&gt; {{Cite web |url= https://www.nyjournalofbooks.com/book-review/how-make-spaceship |title= How to Make a Spaceship: A Band of Renegades, an Epic Race, and the Birth of Private Spaceflight |author= Robert Schaefer |publisher= New York Journal of Books }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=IAPR-2017-09-06&gt; {{cite episode |url= http://iowapublicradio.org/post/how-make-spaceship |network= Iowa Public Radio |series= IPR |title= How to Make a Spaceship |author= Ben Kieffer; Katherine Perkins; |date= 6 September 2017 }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=DW-2016-12-08&gt; {{cite news |url= http://www.dw.com/en/how-to-make-a-spaceship-and-get-off-planet-with-renegades-and-college-dropouts/a-36690087 |title= How to make a spaceship and get 'off planet' with renegades and college-dropouts |author= Zulfikar Abbany |date= 8 December 2016 |publisher= Deutsche Welle }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=WashPost-2016-09-19&gt; {{cite newspaper |url= https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/innovations/wp/2016/09/19/the-renegade-whose-dream-started-the-latest-space-race/?noredirect=on |title= The renegade whose dream started the latest space race |author= Vivek Wadhwa |date= 19 September 2016 |publisher= Washington Post }} &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SFGATE-2016-10-06&gt; {{cite news |url= https://www.sfgate.com/books/article/How-to-Make-a-Spaceship-by-Julian-Guthrie-9882317.php |title= ‘How to Make a Spaceship,’ by Julian Guthrie |author= Tom Zoellner |date= 6 October 2016 |publisher= SFGate }} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Hydrogenoxalate.svg|thumb|right| Wireframe model of hydrogenoxalate]]
'''Hydrogenoxalate''' or '''hydrogen oxalate''' is an [[anion]] with [[chemical formula]] {{chem|HC|2|O|4|-}} or {{chem|HO|2|C–CO|2|-}}, derived from [[oxalic acid]] by the loss of a single [[proton]]; or, alternatively, from the [[oxalate]] anion {{chem|C|2|O|4|2-}} by addition of a proton.

The name is also used for any [[salt (chemistry)|salt]] containing this anion, such as [[sodium hydrogenoxalate|NaHC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], [[potassium hydrogenoxalate|KHC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]], or [[ammonium hydrogenoxalate|NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;HC&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;]].  Hydrogenoxalates may also be called (especially in older literature) '''bioxalates''', '''acid oxalates''', or '''monobasic oxalates'''.

'''Hyperchromicity''' is the increase of [[absorbance]] (''optical density'') of a material. The most famous example is the hyperchromicity of [[DNA]] that occurs when the DNA duplex is denatured.&lt;ref&gt;[https://pubs.acs.org/doi/abs/10.1021/acs.jchemed.6b00095?journalCode=jceda8]&lt;/ref&gt; The [[UV]] absorption is increased when the two single [[DNA]] strands are being separated, either by heat or by addition of denaturant or by increasing the [[pH]] level. The opposite, a decrease of absorbance is called '''hypochromicity'''.

==Hyperchromicity in DNA denaturation==
Heat denaturation of DNA, also called [[DNA melting | melting]], causes the double helix structure to unwind to form single stranded DNA.  When DNA in solution is heated above its melting temperature (usually more than 80&amp;nbsp;°C), the double-stranded DNA unwinds to form single-stranded DNA. The bases become unstacked and can thus absorb more light. In their native state, the bases of DNA absorb light in the 260-nm wavelength region. When the bases become unstacked, the wavelength of maximum absorbance does not change, but the amount absorbed increases by 37%. A double stranded DNA strand dissociating to two single strands produces a sharp cooperative transition.

Hyperchromicity can be used to track the condition of DNA as temperature changes.  The transition/melting temperature (T&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;) is the temperature where the absorbance of UV light is 50% between the maximum and minimum, i.e. where 50% of the DNA is denatured.a ten fold increase of monovalent cation concentration increases the temperature by 16.6 degree C

The '''hyperchromic effect''' is the striking increase in absorbance of DNA upon denaturation. The two strands of DNA are bound together mainly by the stacking interactions, hydrogen bonds and [[hydrophobic effect]] between the complementary bases. The hydrogen bond limits the resonance of the aromatic ring so the absorbance of the sample is limited as well. When the DNA double helix is treated with denatured agents, the interaction force holding the double helical structure is disrupted. The double helix then separates into two single strands which are in the random coiled conformation. At this time, the base-base interaction will be reduced, increasing the [[UV]] absorbance of DNA solution because many bases are in free form and do not form hydrogen bonds with complementary bases. As a result, the absorbance for single-stranded DNA will be 37% higher than that for double stranded DNA at the same concentration.

The '''International Heliophysical Year''' is a [[United Nations|UN]]-sponsored scientifically driven international program of scientific collaboration to understand external drivers of planetary environments and universal processes in [[Solar system|solar]]-terrestrial-[[Planets|planetary]]-[[heliosphere|heliospheric]] physics.  The IHY will focus on  advancements in all aspects of the [[heliosphere]] and its interaction with the [[interstellar medium]]. This effort culminates in the "International Heliophysical Year" (IHY) in 2007-2008. The IHY concluded in February, 2009, but was largely continued via the International Space Weather Initiative (ISWI)

The term ''"[[Heliophysics|Heliophysical]]"'' was coined to refer specifically to this activity of studying the interconnectedness of the entire [[Solar system|solar]]-[[Heliosphere|heliospheric]]-[[Planets|planetary]] system.  It is a broadening of the concept "[[geophysical]]," extending the connections from the Earth to the Sun &amp; interplanetary space. On the 50th anniversary of the [[International Geophysical Year]], the 2007 IHY activities will build on the success of IGY 1957 by continuing its legacy of system-sides studies of the extended heliophysical domain.

==History==
The IHY 2007 has been planned to coincide with the fiftieth anniversary of the [[International Geophysical Year|International Geophysical Year (IGY)]]  in 1957-1958, one of the most successful international science programs of all time.  The [[International Geophysical Year|IGY]] was a broad-based and all-encompassing effort to push the frontiers of [[geophysics]] and resulted in tremendous progress in space physics, Sun-Earth connections, [[planetary science]] and the [[heliosphere]] in general. The tradition of international science years began almost 125 years ago with the first [[International Polar Year]]  and international scientific studies of global processes at the North Pole in 1882-1883.  The IHY has received substantial support from the United Nations, and various space agencies around the world.

==Objectives==
The IHY has three primary objectives:

* Advancing our Understanding of the Heliophysical Processes that Govern the Sun, Earth and Heliosphere
* Continuing the tradition of international research and advancing the legacy on the 50th anniversary of the International Geophysical Year
* Demonstrating the Beauty, Relevance and Significance of Space and Earth Science to the World

==Science Goals==
The IHY team has also identified the following science goals for 2007-2008:

# Develop the basic science of heliophysics through cross-disciplinary studies of [https://web.archive.org/web/20051116084732/http://ihy.gsfc.nasa.gov/science_themes.shtml universal processes].
# Determine the response of terrestrial and [[planet]]ary [[magnetosphere]]s and [[Celestial body atmosphere|atmospheres]] to external drivers. 
# Promote research on the [[Sun]]-[[heliosphere]] system outward to the local [[interstellar medium]] - the new frontier.
# Foster international scientific cooperation in the study of heliophysical phenomena now and in the future
# Communicate unique IHY results to the scientific community and the general public

'''John Bird''' (1709–1776), the [[mathematical instrument]] maker, was born at [[Bishop Auckland]]. He worked in London for [[Jonathan Sisson]], and by 1745 he had his own business in the Strand. Bird was commissioned to make a brass [[Quadrant (instrument)|quadrant]] 8 [[Foot (unit)|feet]] across for the [[Royal Observatory, Greenwich|Royal Observatory at Greenwich]], where it is still preserved. Soon after, duplicates were ordered for France, Spain and Russia.

[[File:Mural Quadrant - by John Bird - London 1773.jpg|thumb|Mural quadrant constructed as a frame mounted on a wall. This instrument was made by Bird in 1773 and is in the [[Museum of the History of Science, Oxford]].]]Bird supplied the astronomer [[James Bradley]] with further instruments of such quality that the commissioners of longitude paid him [[Pound sterling|£]]500 (a huge sum) on condition that he take on a 7-year apprentice and produce in writing upon oath, a full account of his working methods. This was the origin of Bird's two treatises ''The Method of Dividing Mathematical Instruments'' (1767) and ''The Method of Constructing Mural Quadrants'' (1768). Both had a foreword from the astronomer-royal [[Nevil Maskelyne]]. When the Houses of Parliament [[Burning of Parliament|burned down in 1834]], the standard [[yard]]s of 1758 and 1760, both constructed by Bird, were destroyed.

Bird, with his fellow [[County Durham]] savant [[William Emerson (mathematician)|William Emerson]], makes an appearance in ''Mason and Dixon'' the novel by [[Thomas Pynchon]].

These are [[seashell]]s, the shells of various [[marine (ocean)|marine]] [[mollusk]]s including both [[gastropod]] and [[bivalve]]s. Each one was chosen to represent a [[sea|maritime]] state, based on the fact that the species occurs in that state and was considered suitable to represent the state, either because of the species' commercial importance as a local [[seafood]] item, or because of its beauty, rarity, exceptional size, or other features.

This is a list of '''[[Profiling (computer programming)|performance analysis]] tools''' for use in [[software development]].

==General purpose, language independent==
The following tools work based on log files that can be generated from various systems.
* TimeToPic visualizes a log file. If system has logging facility, its output can be shown on visual timeline. Developer can see from visualization what is happening on log. Can be used for code and "logic" level analysis. There are version for Windows and Linux. Supports log sizes up to 1 Gigabyte.
* [[time (Unix)]] - can be used to determine the run time of a program, separately counting user time vs. system time, and CPU time vs. clock time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/heterogeneous-computing/codexl/ |title=CodeXL |deadurl=yes |accessdate=26 September 2013 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130919162818/http://developer.amd.com/tools-and-sdks/heterogeneous-computing/codexl/ |archivedate=19 September 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Consiglio Nazionale delle Ricerche''' ('''CNR''')  or '''National Research Council''', is the largest research council in Italy. As a public organisation, its remit is to support [[scientific]] and [[technological]] [[research]]. Its headquarters are in [[Rome]].

==History==
The institution was founded in 1923. The first president was [[Vito Volterra]], succeeded by [[Guglielmo Marconi]]. The process of improvement of the national scientific research, through the use of specific laws, (see Law 59/1997), affects many research organizations, and amongst them is CNR, whose "primary function is to carry on, through its own organs, advanced basic and applied research, both to develop and maintain its own scientific competitiveness, and to be ready to take part effectively in a timely manner in the strategic fields defined by the national planning system".

On 23 December 1987, CNR registers the first Italian internet domain: cnr.it

==Reorganization==
With the issuing of the legislative decree of 30 January 1999, n. 19, which defines "The reorganization of the National Research Council" the central role of CNR in the Italian research system is confirmed.

In particular CNR is defined (see Article 1 of the above-mentioned decree 19/1999) as a "national research organization, with general scientific competence and with scientific research institutes distributed across Italy, which carries out activities of primary interest for the promotion of science and the progress of the country".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cnr.it/istituti/Istituti_eng.html National Research Council]&lt;/ref&gt;

CNR has the legal status of a public organization, and defines for itself autonomous rules and regulations, in accordance with the existing laws and the [[Civil Code]].

==Mission==
The new CNR has the following mission and activities:
*It promotes and carries on research activities, in pursuit of excellence and strategic relevance within the national and international ambit, in the frame of European cooperation and integration; in cooperation with academic research and with other private and public organizations, ensures the dissemination of results inside the country;
*in the scope of its triennial plan of activity and in the frame of the collaboration with universities and other private and public organizations, CNR defines, manages and coordinates national and international research programs, in addition to supporting scientific and research activities of major relevance to the nation; 
*it promotes the valorization, the precompetitive development and the [[Technology transfer|technological transfer]] of research results carried on by its own scientific network and by third parties with whom cooperative relationships have been established;
*it promotes collaboration in scientific and technological fields, and in the technical regulations field, with organizations and institutions of other Countries, and with supranational organizations in the frame of extra-governmental agreements; it provides, upon request from government authorities, specific skills for the participation of Italy in organizations or international scientific programs of an inter-governmental nature;
*it carries on, through its own program of [[scholarship]]s and research fellowships, educational and training activities in Ph.D. courses, in advanced after-university specialization courses, and in programs of continuous or recurring education; CNR can also perform activities of non university related higher education; 
*it provides supervision over those organizations designated to issue rules and regulations (see Law of 21 June 1986, n. 317), activity of dissemination of technical specifications in the frame of its institutional tasks, and, on demand, activities of certification, test and accreditation for [[Public Administration]];
*provides technical and scientific support to Public Administration upon their request;
*in the frame of fulfilling its institutional activities, CNR can supply private law services to third parties.

For the execution of these activities and any other activity related to them, CNR can stipulate agreements and contracts, establish or participate in [[Consortium|consortia]], foundations or societies with private or public parties, Italian or foreign.

In addition, through agreements or participation, CNR can implement programs, directives and regulations of the Regional governments or other Public Administrations, aimed to the dissemination of the research results in the economic system; it can also contribute to the realization of the conditions needed for the establishment of highly innovative enterprises.

Finally, CNR can participate in international research centers, in collaboration with analogous scientific institutions of other Countries.

[[Image:Galton number form.svg|thumb|right|300px|A number form from one of Francis Galton's (1888) subjects. Note the convolutions, and how the first 12 digits correspond to a clock face.]]

A '''number form''' is a mental map of [[number]]s, which [[Automaticity|automatically]] and involuntarily appears whenever someone who experiences number-forms thinks of numbers. Numbers are mapped into distinct spatial locations and the mapping may be different across individuals. Number forms were first documented and named by Sir [[Francis Galton]] in his ''The Visions of Sane Persons'' {{Harv|Galton|1881a}}. Later research has identified them as a type of [[synesthesia]] ({{Harvnb|Seron|Pesenti|Noël|1992}}; {{Harvnb|Sagiv|Simner|Collins|Butterworth|2006}}).

== Neural mechanisms ==
It has been suggested that number-forms are a result of "cross-activation" between regions of the [[parietal lobe]] that are involved in [[Numerical Cognition|numerical cognition]] and angular gyrus for spatial cognition ({{Harvnb|Ramachandran|Hubbard|2001}}; {{Harvnb|Hubbard|Pinel|Piazza|Dehaene|2005}}). Since the areas that process numerical and spatial representations are close to each other, this may contribute to the increased cross-activation. Compared to non-synesthetes, [[synesthesia|synesthetes]] display larger [[P3b]] amplitudes for month cues, but similar [[Visual N1|N1]] and P3b responses for arrow (&lt;- or -&gt;) and word (left or right) cues. ({{Harvnb|Teuscher|Brang|Ramachandran|Coulson|2010}}).

== Reaction time research ==
[[Reaction time]] studies have shown that number-form synesthetes are faster to say which of two numbers is larger when the numbers are arranged in a manner consistent with their number-form, suggesting that number forms are automatically evoked ({{Harvnb|Sagiv|Simner|Collins|Butterworth|2006}}; {{Harvnb|Piazza|Pinel|Dehaene|in press}}).  This can be thought of as a "spatial [[Stroop effect|Stroop]]" task, in which space is not relevant to the task, but which can hinder performance despite its irrelevance.  The fact that synesthetes cannot ignore the spatial arrangement of the numbers on the screen demonstrates that numbers are automatically evoking spatial cues. The reaction times for valid cues are smaller than invalid cues (words and arrows), but in synesthetes the response time differences for months are larger than those of non-synesthetes ({{Harvnb|Teuscher|Brang|Ramachandran|Coulson|2010}}).

== Differences with number line ==
These number forms can be distinguished from the non-conscious mental [[number line]] that we all have by the fact that they are 1) [[conscious]], 2) [[idiosyncratic]] (see image) and 3) stable across the lifespan. Although this form of synesthesia has not been as intensively studied as [[Grapheme → color synesthesia]], Hubbard and colleagues have argued that similar neural mechanisms might be involved, but acting in different brain regions ({{Harvnb|Hubbard|Pinel|Piazza|Dehaene|2005}}). Future studies will need to be conducted to test this hypothesis.

[[File:Occupational English Test logo.png|thumbnail|right]]
'''The Occupational English Test''' (also known as '''OET''') is an international [[English language]] test for the healthcare sector. It assesses the language communication skills of healthcare professionals who wish to register and practise in an English-speaking environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2428] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2428 Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

OET is available for the following 12 professions: dentistry, dietetics, medicine, nursing, occupational therapy, optometry, pharmacy, physiotherapy, podiatry, radiography, speech pathology, and veterinary science.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

OET was designed in the late 1980s by Professor [[Tim McNamara]], under the guidance of the [[Australian National Office for Overseas Skills Recognition]] (NOOSR), which administered the test at that time. The test has been researched and developed continuously since then to ensure that it has kept up with current theory and practice in language assessment. This work has been done primarily by the [[University of Melbourne|University of Melbourne’s]] Language Testing Research Centre and, more recently, also by [[Cambridge English Language Assessment]].

Since March 2013 the test has been owned by '''Cambridge Boxhill Language Assessment Trust (CBLA)''', a venture between [[Cambridge English Language Assessment]] and [[Box Hill Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2428] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2428 Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Recognition==
OET is recognised by regulatory healthcare bodies and councils in [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]] and [[Singapore]], [[Malaysia]], the [[Philippines]], recently in [[UK]] and [[Ireland]]. Many organisations, including hospitals, universities and colleges, are using OET as proof of a candidate’s ability to communicate effectively in a demanding healthcare environment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2411] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2411 Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, OET is recognised by the Australian Department of Immigration and Border Protection for a number of visa categories, including work and student visas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2428] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2428 Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Each recognising organisation determines which grade results mean that candidates meet the language competency standards to function in their profession.  A full list of regulatory organisations which accept OET can be seen on the [http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2434 official website].

==Format==
OET provides a valid and reliable assessment of all four language skills – Listening, Reading, Writing and Speaking – with an emphasis on communication in medical and health professional settings.
OET consists of four sub-tests:
* Listening (approximately 50 minutes)
* Reading (60 minutes)
* Writing (45 minutes)
* Speaking (approximately 20 minutes).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2411] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2411 Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Listening'''

The listening test consists of two parts. In Part A, candidates listen to a simulated consultation (dialogue) between a professional and a patient and are required to take notes under headings. In Part B, candidates listen to a health professional giving a short talk on a health-related topic and are required to complete a range of open-ended and fixed-choice questions.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Documents/ViewDocument.aspx?club=oet&amp;DocumentID=7592d58c-f766-4637-98c1-542133ab44f5] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Documents/ViewDocument.aspx?club=oet&amp;DocumentID=7592d58c-f766-4637-98c1-542133ab44f5 Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reading'''

The reading test consists of two parts. In Part A, lasting 15 minutes, candidates are asked to skim read 3 or 4 short texts and complete a summary paragraph by filling in the missing words. It is designed to test the reader’s ability to scan texts within a time limit, source information from multiple texts, and synthesise information. In Part B, lasting 45 minutes, candidates are asked to read two passages on a general healthcare topic and answer 8–10 multiple choice questions for each text. It is designed to test the reader’s ability to read and comprehend longer texts.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Documents/ViewDocument.aspx?club=oet&amp;DocumentID=b5d05b93-a046-4d09-8e87-1e06ef2ef04c] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Documents/ViewDocument.aspx?club=oet&amp;DocumentID=b5d05b93-a046-4d09-8e87-1e06ef2ef04c Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Writing'''

The writing paper asks candidates to write a letter, usually a letter of referral. For some professions a different type of letter is required, e.g. a letter of transfer or discharge, or a letter to advise a patient, carer or group. Candidates are given case notes which must be included in their letter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2569[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=256] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2569 Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Speaking'''

The speaking test is in the form of one-to-one conversations with an interlocutor. It starts with a short warm-up interview about the candidate’s professional background. This is followed by two role plays. Candidates have 2–3 minutes to prepare for each role play.  Role plays last about five minutes and are based on typical interactions between a health professional and a patient. The candidate adopts their usual professional role (e.g. as a nurse) and the interviewer plays a patient or sometimes a relative or carer. For veterinary science the interviewer is the owner or carer of the animal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2569] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2569 Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scoring==
Each of the four sub-tests that make up OET are graded A to E, where A is the highest grade and E is the lowest. There is no overall grade.

{| class="wikitable"
|-
! OET grade !! Description of ability
|-
| A || Very high level of performance
|-
| B || High level of performance, i.e. able to use English with fluency and accuracy adequate for professional needs
|-
| C || Good level of performance; however, not acceptable to a range of health and medical councils
|-
| D || Moderate level of performance; requires improvement
|-
| E || Low level of performance; requires considerable improvement
|}

'''Listening and reading'''

There is no fixed score-to-grade link for the listening and reading tests. Grade boundaries are continually reset because different test materials are used at each administration. A mean average of the percentage of candidates in each grade for the writing and speaking tests is applied to the spread of performances on the listening and reading tests to establish the grade boundaries.

'''Writing and speaking'''

In writing and speaking, the score is generated through statistical analysis of the two sets of scores from two independent assessors. This is converted, following established practice, to the final grade.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2571] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2571 Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Timing and results==
OET is available up to 12 times a year and can be taken at test venues around the world. A full list is available on the [http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2537 official website].

Results are published online approximately 16 business days after the test. Official statements of results are sent out in the post following the release of online results. There is no overall grade – candidates receive separate grades for each sub-test.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2411] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2411 Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

Most recognising organisations require candidates to have at least a B grade in each of the four sub-tests and recognise results as valid for up to two years. Most recognising organisations also require that candidates achieve the requisite grades for each sub-test in one sitting. However, candidates should check with the organisation that regulates their profession to confirm current requirements.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2571] http://www.occupationalenglishtest.org/Display.aspx?tabid=2571 Accessed 02 February 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

==Scandals==
The Occupational English Test was plagued with criticism from an Australian Government's Parliamentary Enquiry in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.aph.gov.au/Parliamentary_Business/Committees/House_of_Representatives_Committees?url=/haa/overseasdoctors/subs.htm&lt;/ref&gt; The broader community made negative statements about testing conditions and marking consistency to the Enquiry. One submission claimed that it is possible to get a pass by re-sitting the test multiple times as you will eventually be marked higher after 6 sittings of the OET test.

==Research==
OET is underpinned by over 30 years of research and the test is regularly updated to keep pace with changes in language testing in a healthcare context. There is strong emphasis on the ongoing validity and reliability of the test.  Leading language testing academics contribute to the continued development of the test, and subject matter experts are consulted to ensure that tasks are based on a typical workplace situations and the demands of the profession.

[[File:Ptolemy World Map.jpg|thumb|Map of the "Old World" (the [[Ptolemy world map]] in a 15th-century copy)]]

The term "'''Old World'''" is used commonly in the West to refer to [[Africa]], [[Asia]] and [[Europe]] ([[Afro-Eurasia]] or the World Island), regarded collectively as the part of the [[world]] known to its population before contact with the [[Americas]] and [[Oceania]] (the "[[New World]]").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/old-world?show=2&amp;t=1417643287 |title=Old World |work=[[Merriam-Webster|Merriam-Webster Dictionary]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is used in the context of, and contrasts with, the [[New World]] (the [[Americas]] and [[Oceania]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/new%20world |title=New world |work=Merriam-Webster Dictionary }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
In the context of [[archaeology]] and [[world history]], the term "Old World" includes those parts of the world which were in (indirect) cultural contact from the [[Bronze Age]] onwards, resulting in the parallel development of the early [[civilization]]s, mostly in the [[temperate]] zone between roughly the [[45th parallel north|45th]] and [[25th parallel north|25th]] parallels, in the area of the [[History of the Mediterranean region|Mediterranean]], [[Mesopotamia]], [[Iranian plateau|Persian plateau]], [[Indian subcontinent]] and [[History of China#Ancient China|China]].

These regions were connected via the [[Silk Road]] trade route, and they have a pronounced [[Iron Age]] period following the Bronze Age. In cultural terms, the Iron Age was accompanied by the so-called [[Axial Age]], referring to cultural, philosophical and religious developments eventually leading to the emergence of the historical [[Western world|Western]] ([[Hellenistic philosophy|Hellenism]], "[[classics|classical]]"), Near Eastern ([[Zoroastrian]] and [[Abrahamic]]) and Far Eastern ([[Hinduism]], [[Buddhism]], [[Jainism]], [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]]) cultural spheres.

==History==
The concept of the three [[continent]]s in the Old World, viz. [[Asia]], [[Africa]], and [[Europe]], goes back to [[classical antiquity]]. Their boundaries as defined by [[Ptolemy]] and other geographers of antiquity were drawn along the [[Nile]] and [[Don River (Russia)|Don]] rivers.{{citation needed|date=March 2017}} This definition remained influential throughout the Middle Ages (see [[T and O map]]) and the [[Early Modern period]].{{citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Other names==
The [[mainland]] of [[Afro-Eurasia]] (excluding [[island]]s such as the [[British Isles]], [[Japan]], [[Sri Lanka]], [[Madagascar]] and the [[Malay Archipelago]]) has been referred to as the ''[[World Island]]''.  The term may have been coined by Sir [[Halford John Mackinder]] in ''[[The Geographical Pivot of History]]''.&lt;ref&gt;See Francis P. Sempa, [http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_14/sempa_mac2.html "Mackinder's World."]  ''American Diplomacy'' (UNC.edu).  Retrieved 2018-09-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

The equivalent of the Old World had names in some of its ancient cultures, including [[Midgard]] in Germanic cosmology, and [[Oikoumene]] among the Greeks.

* Predecessors
** [[NPL network]] &amp;ndash;  a local area computer network operated by a team from the [[National Physical Laboratory (United Kingdom)|National Physical Laboratory]] in England that pioneered the concept of [[packet switching]].
** [[ARPANET]] &amp;ndash; an early packet switching network and the first network to implement the protocol suite [[TCP/IP]] which later became a technical foundation of the Internet.
** [[Merit Network]] &amp;ndash; a computer network created in 1966 to connect the mainframe computers at universities that is currently the oldest running regional computer network in the United States.
** [[CYCLADES]] &amp;ndash; a French research network created in the early 1970s that pioneered the concept of packet switching, and was developed to explore alternatives to the ARPANET design.
** [[CSNET|Computer Science Network]] (CSNET) &amp;ndash; a computer network created in the United States for computer science departments at academic and research institutions that could not be directly connected to ARPANET, due to funding or authorization limitations. It played a significant role in spreading awareness of, and access to, national networking and was a major milestone on the path to development of the global Internet.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7401">The '''Phillips report''' was a document summarizing a review conducted in November–December 1965 by a [[NASA]] team headed by Lt Gen [[Samuel C. Phillips]], director of the [[Project Apollo|Apollo]] manned [[Moon landing]] program, to investigate schedule slippage and cost overruns incurred by [[North American Aviation]], manufacturer of the [[Apollo Command/Service Module|Command/Service Module]] spacecraft and the second stage of the [[Saturn V]] [[launch vehicle]]. Phillips sent a summary of his findings with a strongly worded letter to NAA president [[Lee Atwood]] demanding corrective action be taken. North American revised its management of its Apollo contract items, and NASA management considered the matter a normal part of confidential agency-contractor relations.

But after a fire killed the entire crew of the first manned Apollo mission [[Apollo 1]] on January 27, 1967, a [[United States Senate Committee on Aeronautical and Space Sciences]] hearing overseeing NASA's investigation of the accident, led to the public disclosure of the Phillips Report by then junior Senator [[Walter Mondale]], who was told of its existence by [[ABC news]] reporter [[Jules Bergman]], who had seen a copy at NASA's Washington, DC [[NASA headquarters|Office of Manned Space Flight headquarters]].

==Review and NASA's response==
From November 22 to December 6, 1965, Phillips headed a [[tiger team]] investigating the causes of inadequate quality, schedule delays, and cost overruns in both the Apollo CSM and the Saturn V second stage, for which North American was prime contractor. He gave an oral presentation (with transparencies) of his team's findings to his boss, NASA Office of Manned Space Flight Administrator [[George E. Mueller]], and Mueller's boss, NASA Deputy Director [[Robert Seamans]], and also presented them in a letter to North American president [[Lee Atwood]], to which Mueller appended his own strongly worded letter to Atwood.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web  | last = Garber  | first = Steve  | authorlink =  | title = NASA Apollo Mission Apollo-1 -- Phillips Report  | work =

==Public disclosure and criticism==

Immediately after the fire in 1967, NASA followed its established procedure of investigating and identifying corrections for the cause, with Presidential and Congressional oversight. No one in NASA's upper management expected that the Phillips findings would be printed as a document, but this had been done and on February 13, Bergman was shown a copy at the [[NASA Headquarters|Office of Manned Space Flight headquarters]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web  | last =   | first =   | authorlink =  | title = Before This Decade is Out: Personal Reflections on the Apollo Program  | work = SP-4223  | publisher = NASA  | url =   | doi =  | accessdate = July 21, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He then told a junior Senator on the Aeronautical and Space Sciences Committee, [[Walter Mondale]], about the document, and later reported its existence on ABC. Mondale proceeded to grill the top managers, including Webb who was completely blind-sided (the formal review had not gone above Seamans), about the report's existence. Other Senators, such as [[Margaret Chase Smith|Margaret Chase]], then questioned Webb about NASA's choice of North American as the Apollo contractor.

Mondale said he had been told of the existence what he called "the Phillips report", and Seamans was afraid that Mondale might be in possession of a hard copy of the presentation, so he said tentatively that contractors have occasionally been given negative reviews, but that he knew of no such extraordinary report. Mondale raised controversy over the report, despite Phillips' refusal to characterize it as such before Congress, and was angered by what he perceived as Webb's deception and concealment of important program problems from Congress, and questioned NASA's selection of North American as prime contractor.&lt;ref&gt;On May 11, Webb issued a statement defending the selection. On June 9, Seamans filed a seven-page memorandum documenting the process that led to North American's selection in November 1961. {{cite web | url = http://www.astronautix.com/craft/csmction.htm | title = CSM Source Selection | publisher = [[Encyclopedia Astronautica]] | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110924092529/http://www.astronautix.com/craft/csmction.htm | archivedate = 2011-09-24 | df =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; Webb eventually provided a controlled copy of Phillips' memo to Congress. Seamans later wrote that Webb roundly chastised him in the cab ride leaving the hearing, for volunteering information which led to the disclosure of Phillips' memo.

==Senate conclusions==
The committee concluded in its final report that "the findings of the [Phillips] task force had no effect on the accident, did not lead to the accident, and were not related to the accident," but in its recommendations, stated "the committee believes it should have been informed of the situation."&lt;ref name="as204_senate"/&gt; Freshman Senators [[Edward Brooke]] and [[Charles H. Percy]] jointly wrote an "Additional Views" section appended to the committee report, expressing a bit more strongly that the Phillips review should have been disclosed to Congress. Mondale wrote his own Additional View, voicing his complaints in the most strongly worded terms.

In its final report, the committee agreed with NASA that the Phillips review had absolutely no bearing on the fire, though the chairman expressed his disappointment that Webb had not kept them informed of Apollo program problems at the time. But Mondale issued a minority opinion accusing NASA of "evasiveness, ... lack of candor, ... patronizing attitude exhibited toward Congress, ... refusal to respond fully and forthrightly to legitimate congressional inquiries, and ... solicitous concern for corporate sensitivities at a time of national tragedy".&lt;ref name="as204_senate"&gt;{{Cite journal |last    = Anderson |first   = Clinton P. |authorlink  = Clinton P.

'''''Pioneer 11''''' (also known as '''''Pioneer G''''') is a {{convert|259|kg|lb|adj=mid}} [[Robotic spacecraft|robotic]] [[space probe]] launched by [[NASA]] on April 6, 1973 to study the [[asteroid belt]], the environment around [[Jupiter]] and [[Saturn]], [[solar wind]] and [[cosmic ray]]s.&lt;ref name="PionOdys" /&gt; It was the first probe to [[Exploration of Saturn|encounter Saturn]] and the second to fly through the [[Asteroid belt#Exploration|asteroid belt]] and [[Exploration of Jupiter|by Jupiter]]. Thereafter, ''Pioneer 11'' became the [[List of artificial objects leaving the Solar System|second of five artificial objects]] to achieve the [[escape velocity]] that will allow them to [[Solar System#Farthest regions|leave the Solar System]]. Due to power constraints and the vast distance to the probe, the last routine contact with the spacecraft was on September 30, 1995, and the last good engineering data was received on November 24, 1995.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/missions/archive/pioneer.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="InDepth"&gt;{{cite web|title=Pioneer 11: In Depth|url=https://solarsystem.nasa.gov/missions/pioneer11/indepth|accessdate=10 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mission background==
===History===
Approved in February 1969, ''Pioneer 11'' and its twin probe, ''[[Pioneer 10]]'', were the first to be designed for exploring the [[outer Solar System]]. Yielding to multiple proposals throughout the 1960s, early mission objectives were defined as:
* Explore the [[interplanetary medium]] beyond the orbit of Mars
* Investigate the nature of the asteroid belt from the scientific standpoint and assess the belt's possible hazard to missions to the outer planets.
* Explore the [[Atmosphere of Jupiter|environment of Jupiter]].

Subsequent planning for an encounter with Saturn added many more goals:
* Map the magnetic field of Saturn and determine its intensity, direction, and structure.
* Determine how many electrons and protons of various energies are distributed along the trajectory of the spacecraft through the Saturn system.
* Map the interaction of the Saturn system with the [[solar wind]].
* Measure the temperature of Saturn's atmosphere and that of Titan, the largest satellite of Saturn.
* Determine the structure of the upper atmosphere of Saturn where molecules are expected to be electrically charged and form an ionosphere.
* Map the thermal structure of [[Atmosphere of Saturn|Saturn's atmosphere]] by infrared observations coupled with [[radio occultation]] data.
* Obtain spin-scan images of the [[Saturnian system]] in two colors during the encounter sequence and polarimetry measurements of the planet.
* Probe the ring system and the atmosphere of Saturn with S-band radio occultation.
* Determine more precisely the masses of Saturn and its larger satellites by accurate observations of the effects of their gravitational fields on the motion of the spacecraft.
* As a precursor to the [[Voyager Program|Mariner Jupiter/Saturn mission]], verify the environment of the ring plane to find out where it may be safely crossed by the Mariner spacecraft without serious damage.&lt;ref&gt;Mark, Hans: [https://history.nasa.gov/SP-349/ch5.htm ''Pioneer Odyssey'' SP-349/396, Chapter 5, NASA-Ames Research Center, 1974]&lt;/ref&gt;

''Pioneer 11'' was built by [[TRW Inc.|TRW]] and managed as part of the [[Pioneer program]] by [[NASA Ames Research Center]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasa.gov/centers/ames/missions/archive/pioneer.html NASA - The Pioneer Missions]&lt;/ref&gt; A backup unit, [[Pioneer H]], is currently on display in the "Milestones of Flight" exhibit at the [[National Air and Space Museum]] in [[Washington, D.C.]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasm.si.edu/exhibitions/gal100/index.cfm#pioneer10|title=Milestones of Flight|publisher=Smithsonian National Air and Space Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many elements of the mission proved to be critical in the planning of the [[Voyager program|''Voyager'' program]].&lt;ref name="burrows"&gt;William E. Burrows, ''Exploring Space'', (New York: Random House, 1990)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|266–8}}

===Spacecraft design===
The ''Pioneer 11'' bus measured {{convert|36|cm|in|sp=us}} deep and with six {{convert|76|cm|in|sp=us|adj=mid|-long}} panels forming the hexagonal structure. The bus housed propellant to control the orientation of the probe and eight of the twelve scientific instruments. The spacecraft had a mass of 260 kilograms.&lt;ref name="PionOdys"/&gt;{{rp|42}}

====Attitude control and propulsion====
{{Css Image Crop|Image= Pioneer 10 - Pioneer 11 - thrusters - p43.jpg|bSize= 339|cWidth= 75|cHeight= 75|oTop= 15|oLeft= 0|Location= right}}

Information for the orientation was provided by performing [[conical scanning]] maneuvers to track Earth in its orbit,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Weebau Spaceflight Encyclopedia| date = 9 November 2010| url = http://weebau.com/satplan/pioneer%2010.htm| accessdate = 12 January 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; a [[Star tracker#Star tracker|star sensor]] able to reference [[Canopus]], and two [[Sun sensor]]s.&lt;ref name="PionOdys"/&gt;{{rp|42–43}}

====Communications====
:The space probe included a redundant system  [[transceiver]]s, one attached to the [[high-gain antenna]], the other to an omni-antenna and medium-gain antenna. Each transceiver was 8 watts and transmitted data across the [[S-band]] using 2110 MHz for the uplink from Earth and 2292 MHz for the downlink to Earth with the [[Deep Space Network]] tracking the signal. Prior to transmitting data, the probe used a [[convolutional code|convolutional encoder]] to allow [[error correction|correction of errors]] in the received data on Earth.&lt;ref name="PionOdys"/&gt;{{rp|43}}

====Power====
[[File:Two of four SNAP 19 RTGs of a Pioneer space probe.jpg|right|75px|SNAP-19 RTG]]
:''Pioneer 11'' used four SNAP-19 [[radioisotope thermoelectric generator]]s (RTGs) ('''''[[:Image:Cutdrawing of an SNAP 19 RTG.jpg|see diagram]]'''''). They were positioned on two three-rod trusses, each {{convert|3|m|ftin|abbr=off|sp=us}} in length and 120 degrees apart. This was expected to be a safe distance from the sensitive scientific experiments carried on board. Combined, the RTGs provided 155 watts at launch, and decayed to 140 W in transit to Jupiter. The spacecraft required 100 W to power all systems.&lt;ref name="PionOdys"/&gt;{{rp|44–45}}

====Computer====
:Much of the computation for the mission was performed on Earth and transmitted to the probe, where it was able to retain in memory, up to five commands of the 222 possible entries by ground controllers. The spacecraft included two command decoders and a command distribution unit, a very limited form of processor, to direct operations on the spacecraft. This system required that mission operators prepare commands long in advance of transmitting them to the probe. A data storage unit was included to record up to 6,144 [[bytes]] of information gathered by the instruments. The digital telemetry unit would then be used to prepare the collected data in one of the thirteen possible formats before transmitting it back to Earth.&lt;ref name="PionOdys"/&gt;{{rp|38}}

===Launch and trajectory===
The ''Pioneer 11'' probe was launched on April 6, 1973 at 02:11:00 UTC, by the [[National Aeronautics and Space Administration]] from [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station Space Launch Complex 36|Space Launch Complex 36A]] at [[Cape Canaveral Air Force Station|Cape Canaveral]], Florida aboard an [[Atlas-Centaur]] launch vehicle. Its twin probe, ''[[Pioneer 10]]'', had launched a year earlier on March 3, 1972. ''Pioneer 11'' was launched on a trajectory directly aimed at Jupiter without any prior gravitational assists.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nasa.gov/sites/default/files/images/739459main_ACD97-0036-2.jpg&lt;/ref&gt; In May 1974, Pioneer was retargeted to fly past Jupiter on a north-south trajectory enabling a Saturn flyby in 1979. The maneuver used 17 pounds of propellant, lasted 42 minutes and 36 seconds and increased Pioneer 11's speed by 230&amp;nbsp;km/h.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last= |first= |date=9 May 1974 |title=Pioneer 11 Successfully Retargeted for Saturn |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zTFpyBr4WvgC&amp;pg=PA294 |magazine=New Scientist |location= |publisher= |access-date=5 December 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also made two mid-course corrections, on April 11, 1973 and November 7, 1974.&lt;ref name="InDepth"/&gt;

===Encounter with Jupiter===
{{main|Exploration of Jupiter}}
''Pioneer 11'' flew past Jupiter in November and December 1974. During its closest approach, on December 2, it passed {{convert|42,828|km|mi|sp=us}} above the cloud tops.&lt;ref name="PDSOverview"/&gt; The probe obtained detailed images of the [[Great Red Spot]], transmitted the first images of the immense polar regions, and determined the mass of Jupiter's moon [[Callisto (moon)|Callisto]]. Using the gravitational pull of Jupiter, a [[gravity assist]] was used to alter the trajectory of the probe towards Saturn. On April 16, 1975, following the Jupiter encounter, the micrometer detector was turned off.&lt;ref name="InDepth"/&gt;

===Saturn encounter===
[[File:Pioneer 11 Saturn Rings.png|thumb|250px|''Pioneer 11'' and Saturn rings on September 1, 1979 (artist's impression)]]
[[Image:An artist's impression of the encounter between Pioneer 11 and Saturn.jpg|thumb|caption|199px|Artist's impression of ''Pioneer 11''{{'}}s flyby of [[Saturn]]]]
''Pioneer 11'' passed by Saturn on September 1, 1979, at a distance of 21,000&amp;nbsp;km from Saturn's cloud tops.

By this time ''[[Voyager 1]]'' and ''[[Voyager 2]]'' had already passed Jupiter and were also en route to Saturn, so it was decided to target ''Pioneer 11'' to pass through the Saturn ring plane at the same position that the soon-to-come Voyager probes would use in order to test the route before the Voyagers arrived. If there were faint ring particles that could damage a probe in that area, mission planners felt it was better to learn about it via Pioneer. Thus, ''Pioneer 11'' was acting as a "pioneer" in a true sense of the word; if danger were detected, then the Voyager probes could be rerouted further away from the rings, but missing the opportunity to visit Uranus and Neptune in the process.

''Pioneer 11'' imaged and nearly collided with one of Saturn's small moons, passing at a distance of no more than {{convert|4000|km|mi|sp=us}}. The object was tentatively identified as [[Epimetheus (moon)|Epimetheus]], a moon discovered the previous day from ''Pioneer''{{'}}s imaging, and suspected from earlier observations by Earth-based telescopes. After the [[Voyager program|Voyager]] flybys, it became known that there are two similarly-sized moons (Epimetheus and [[Janus (moon)|Janus]]) in the same orbit, so there is some uncertainty about which one was the object of Pioneer's near-miss. ''Pioneer 11'' encountered Janus on September 1, 1979 at 14:52 [[UTC]] at a distance of 2500&amp;nbsp;km and [[Mimas (moon)|Mimas]] at 16:20 UTC the same day at 103000&amp;nbsp;km.

Besides Epimetheus, instruments located another previously undiscovered small moon and an additional ring, charted Saturn's magnetosphere and magnetic field and found its planet-size moon, [[Titan (moon)|Titan]], to be too cold for life. Hurtling underneath the ring plane, the probe sent back pictures of Saturn's rings. The rings, which normally seem bright when observed from Earth, appeared dark in the Pioneer pictures, and the dark gaps in the rings seen from Earth appeared as bright rings.

===Interstellar mission===
On February 23, 1990, ''Pioneer 11'' became the 4th man-made object to pass beyond the orbit of the planets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pioneer 11 Is Reported to Leave Solar System|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/02/25/us/pioneer-11-is-reported-to-leave-solar-system.html|accessdate=3 December 2017|date=25 February 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===NASA ends operations===
By 1995, ''Pioneer 11'' could no longer power any of its detectors, so the decision was made to shut it down.&lt;ref name="Farewell"&gt;{{cite news|title=Farewell to a Pioneer|work=Science News|date=14 October 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt; On September 29, 1995, NASA's [[Ames Research Center]], responsible for managing the project, issued a press release that began, "After nearly 22 years of exploration out to the farthest reaches of the Solar System, one of the most durable and productive space missions in history will come to a close."  It indicated NASA would use its [[Deep Space Network]] antennas to listen "once or twice a month" for the spacecraft's signal, until "some time in late 1996" when "its transmitter will fall silent altogether."

==Pioneer anomaly==
{{Main|Pioneer anomaly}}
Analysis of the radio tracking data from the ''Pioneer 10'' and ''11'' spacecraft at distances between 20–70 AU from the Sun has consistently indicated the presence of a small but anomalous [[Doppler effect|Doppler]] frequency drift. The drift can be interpreted as due to a constant acceleration of {{nowrap|(8.74 ± 1.33) × 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt; m/s&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}} directed towards the Sun. Although it is suspected that there is a [[Systematic bias|systematic origin]] to the effect, none was found. As a result, there is sustained interest in the nature of this so-called "[[Pioneer anomaly]]".&lt;ref name=britt20041018&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.space.com/scienceastronomy/mystery_monday_041018.html | accessdate=2011-06-07 | title=The Problem with Gravity: New Mission Would Probe Strange Puzzle | last=Britt | first=Robert Roy | date=October 18, 2004 | publisher=[[Space.com]] | quote=The discrepancy caused by the anomaly amounts to about {{convert|248500|mi|km|abbr=off}}, or roughly the distance between Earth and the Moon.

In [[chemical biology]] and [[biomolecular engineering]], '''rational design''' is the strategy of creating new molecules with a certain functionality, based upon the ability to predict how the molecule's structure will affect its behavior through physical models.  This can be done either from scratch or by making calculated variations on a known structure, and is usually contrasted with [[directed evolution]].  Applications of rational design include:

* [[Protein design]]
* [[Nucleic acid design]]
* [[Drug design]]
* [[Pathway design]]

'''Rural flight''' (or '''rural exodus''') is the [[Human migration|migratory pattern]] of peoples from [[rural sociology|rural areas]] into [[urban area]]s.  It is [[urbanization]] seen from the rural perspective.

In modern times, it often occurs in a region following the [[Factory farming|industrialization]] of [[agriculture]]—when fewer people are needed to bring the same amount of agricultural output to market—and related agricultural services and industries are consolidated.  Rural flight is exacerbated when the population decline leads to the loss of rural services (such as business enterprises and schools), which leads to greater loss of population as people leave to seek those features.

This phenomenon was first articulated through [[Christian McLean]]'s laws of migration in the 1880s, upon which modern theories &lt;!-- modern theories of what, migration? --&gt; are based.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Historical trends==
[[File:Dust Bowl - Dallas, South Dakota 1936.jpg|thumb|rt|250px|The effects of the [[Dust Bowl]] in [[Dallas, South Dakota]], May 1936]]
Prior to the [[Industrial Revolution]], rural flight occurred in mostly localized regions. Pre-industrial societies did not experience large rural-urban migration flows primarily due to the inability of cities to support large populations. Lack of large employment industries, high urban mortality, and low food supplies all served as checks keeping pre-industrial cities much smaller than their modern counterparts. [[Ancient Athens]] and Rome, scholars estimate, had peak populations of 80,000 and 500,000 paling in comparison with their current populations.&lt;ref name=Weeks&gt;{{cite book|last=Weeks|first=John|title=Population: an introduction to concepts and issues|year=2012|publisher=Wadsworth, Cengage Learning|location=Belmont, CA|pages=353–391}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The onset of the Industrial Revolution in Europe in the late 19th century removed many of the checks that had previously constrained urban populations. As food supplies increased and stabilized and industrialized centers moved into place, cities began to support larger populations, sparking the beginning of rural flight on a massive scale.&lt;ref name=Weeks /&gt; The United Kingdom went from having 20% of the population living in urban areas in 1800 to more than 70% by 1925.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Davis|first=Kingsley|title=The Urbanization of the Human Population|url=http://lgdata.s3-website-us-east-1.amazonaws.com/docs/3245/871552/The_Urbanization_of_the_Human_Population--Kingsley_Davis.pdf|publisher=Scientific American|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the late 19th century and early 20th century saw much of rural flight focused in [[Western Europe]] and the United States, as [[industrialization]] spread throughout the world during the 20th century, rural flight and [[urbanization]] followed quickly behind. Today, rural flight is an especially distinctive phenomenon in some of the newer urbanized areas including [[China]] and more recently [[sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name=Weeks /&gt;&lt;ref name=ChinaDaily&gt;{{cite web|last=Juan|first=Shan|title=Rural exodus to cities continue|url=http://usa.chinadaily.com.cn/epaper/2012-08/08/content_15652220.htm|publisher=China Daily|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Dust Bowl ===
The shift from mixed [[subsistence farming]] to commodity crops and livestock began in the late 19th century. New capital market systems and the railroad network began the trend towards larger farms that employed fewer people per acre. These larger farms used more efficient technologies such as steel plows, mechanical [[reaper]]s, and higher-yield seed stock, which reduced human input per unit of production.&lt;ref name="Cronon"&gt;{{cite book | last=Cronon| first=William| title=Nature's Metropolis: Chicago and the Great West| publisher=Norton| location=New York| year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; The other issue on the Great Plains was that people were using inappropriate farming techniques for the soil and weather conditions.  Most [[Homestead Acts|homestead]]ers had family farms generally considered too small to survive (under 320 acres), and European-American subsistence farming could not continue as it was then practiced.

During the [[Dust Bowl]] and the [[Great Depression]] of the 1930s, large numbers of people [[Depopulation of the Great Plains|fled rural areas of the Great Plains]] and the Midwest due to depressed commodity prices and high [[debt load]]s exacerbated by several years of drought and large [[dust storm]]s.&lt;ref name="Cooper"&gt;{{cite book | last=Cooper| first=Michael L.| title=Dust to eat: drought and depression in the 1930s| publisher=Clarion| location=New York| year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rural flight from the Great Plains has been depicted in literature, such as [[John Steinbeck]]'s novel ''[[The Grapes of Wrath]]'' (1939), in which a family from the [[Great Plains]] migrates to [[California]] during the Dust Bowl period of the 1930s.

===Modern rural flight===
Post-World War II rural flight has been caused primarily by the spread of [[industrialized agriculture]]. Small, labor-intensive [[family farms]] have grown into, or have been replaced by, heavily mechanized and specialized industrial farms. While a small family farm typically produced a wide range of crop, garden, and animal products—all requiring substantial labor—large industrial farms typically specialize in just a few crop or livestock varieties, using large machinery and high-density livestock containment systems that require a fraction of the labor per unit produced. For example, [[Iowa State University]] reports the number of [[hog farmer]]s in Iowa dropped from 65,000 in 1980 to 10,000 in 2002, while the number of hogs per farm increased from 200 to 1,400.&lt;ref name="ISU 1"&gt;{{cite web  |url=http://www.card.iastate.edu/iowa_ag_review/summer_03/article1.aspx| title=Living with Hogs in Rural Iowa| year=2003| work=Iowa Ag Review| publisher=[[Iowa State University]]| accessdate=25 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The consolidation of the feed, seed, [[processed grain]], and livestock industries has meant that there are fewer small businesses in rural areas. This decrease in turn exacerbated the decreased demand for labor. Rural areas that used to be able to provide employment for all young adults willing to work in challenging conditions, increasingly provide fewer opportunities for young adults. The situation is made worse by the decrease in services such as schools, business, and cultural opportunities that accompany the decline in population, and the increasing age of the remaining population further stresses the social service system of rural areas.

===Abandonment of small towns===
The rise of corporate agricultural structures directly affects small rural communities, resulting in decreased populations, decreased incomes for some segments, increased income inequality, decreased community participation, fewer retail outlets and less retail trade, and increased environmental pollution.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.extension.iastate.edu/agdm/articles/duffy/DuffyOct97.htm "Changes in Iowa farm structure"]; University of Iowa Extension;&lt;/ref&gt;

== Determinants of rural flight ==
There are several determinants, push and pull, that contribute to rural flight: lower levels of (perceived) economic opportunity in rural communities versus urban ones, lower levels of government investment in rural communities, greater education opportunities in cities, marriages, increased social acceptance in urban areas, and higher levels of rural fertility.

=== Economic determinants ===
Some migrants choose to leave rural communities out of the desire to pursue greater economic opportunity in urban areas. Greater economic opportunities can be real or perceived. According to the [[Harris-Todaro Model]], migration to urban areas will continue as long as "expected urban real income at the margin exceeds real agricultural product" (127).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Harris|first=John|title=Migration, Unemployment and Development: A Two-Sector Analysis|url=http://isites.harvard.edu/fs/docs/icb.topic1222150.files/Session%2018/harris_todaro70.pdf|publisher=American Economic Association|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, sociologist Josef Gugler points out that while individual benefits of increased wages may outweigh the costs of migration, if enough individuals follow this rationale, it can produce harmful effects such as overcrowding and unemployment on a national level.&lt;ref name=Gugler&gt;Gugler, Josef. "Overurbanization Reconsidered." ''Economic Development and Cultural Change'' 31, no. 1 (1 October 1982): 173–89.&lt;/ref&gt; This phenomenon, when the rate of urbanization outpaces the rate of economic growth, is known as [[overurbanization]].&lt;ref name=Davis&gt;Davis, Kingsley, and Hilda Hertz Golden. "Urbanization and the Development of Pre-Industrial Areas." Economic Development and Cultural Change 3, no. 1 (October 1954): 6–26.&lt;/ref&gt; Since the industrialization of agriculture, mechanization has reduced the number of jobs present in rural communities. Some scholars have also attributed rural flight to the effects of globalization as the demand for increased economic competitiveness leads people to choose capital over labor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Perz|first=Stephen|title=The Rural Exodus in the Context of Economic Crisis, Globalization, and Reform in Brazil|journal=The International Migration Review|volume=34|issue=3|pages=842–881|jstor=2675947|year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, rural fertility rates have historically been higher than urban fertility rates.&lt;ref name=Weeks /&gt; The combination of declining rural jobs and a persistently high rural fertility rate has led to rural-urban migration streams. Rural flight also contains a positive feedback loop where previous migrants from rural communities assist new migrants in adjusting to city life. Also known as [[chain migration]], migrant networks lower barriers to rural flight. For example, an overwhelming majority of rural migrants in China located jobs in urban areas through migrant networks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=China Human Development Report 2005: Development with Equity|publisher=UNDP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some families choose to send their children to cities as a form of investment for the future. A study conducted by Bates and Bennett (1974) concluded that rural communities in Zambia that had other viable investment opportunities, like livestock for instance, had lower rates of rural-urban migration as compared to regions without viable investment opportunities. Sending their children into cities can serve as long-term investments with the hope that their children will be able to send remittances back home after getting a job in the city.&lt;ref name=Zambia&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Bates|first=Robert|title=Determinants of the Rural Exodus in Zambia|journal=Cahiers d'Études Africaines|volume=14|issue=55|pages=543–564|jstor=4391333|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are severe challenges faced by poorer people in the agriculture sector because of diminishing access to productive farmland. Foreign investors through [[Foreign direct investment|Foreign Direct Investment]] (FDI) schemes have been encouraged to lease land in rural areas in [[Cambodia]] and [[Ethiopia]]. This has led to the loss of farmland, range land, woodlands and water sources from local communities. Large-scale agricultural projects funded by FDI only employed a few experts specialized in the relevant new technologies.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0024/002457/245765e.pdf|title=Learning knowledge and skills for agriculture to improve rural livelihoods|last=Robinson-Pant|first=Anna|publisher=UNESCO|year=2016|isbn=978-92-3-100169-7|location=|pages=90–91}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social determinants===
In other instances, rural flight may occur in response to social determinants. A study conducted in 2012 indicated that a significant proportion of rural flight in India occurred due to social factors such as migration with household, marriage, and education. Migration with households and marriage affect women in particular as most often they are the ones required to move with households and move for marriage, especially in developing regions.&lt;ref name=India&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hassan|first=Tarique|author2=Khan, Jabir |title=Determinants of Rural Out-Migration in India|journal=International Journal of Advanced Research in Management and Social Sciences|date=December 2012|volume=1|issue=12|url=https://www.academia.edu/5450848|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
	
Rural youth may choose to leave their rural communities as a method of transitioning into adulthood, seeking avenues to greater prosperity. With the stagnation of the rural economy and encouragement from their parents, rural youth may choose to migrate to cities out of social norms – demonstrating leadership and self-respect.&lt;ref name=Youth&gt;{{cite web|last=Min-Harris|first=C.|title=Youth migration and poverty in Sub-Saharan Africa: Empowering the Rural Youth|url=http://www.du.edu/korbel/hrhw/researchdigest/africa/YouthMigration.pdf|publisher=Disponible en ligne dans le site|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; With this societal encouragement combined with depressed rural economies, rural youth form a large proportion of the migrants moving to urban areas. In Sub-Saharan Africa, a study conducted by Touray in 2006 indicated that about 15% (26 million) of urban migrants were youth. 
	
Lastly, natural disasters can often be single-point events that lead to temporarily massive rural-urban migration flows. The 1930s Dust Bowl in the United States, for example, led to the flight of 2.5 million people from the Plains by 1940, many to the new cities in the West. It is estimated that as many as one out of every four residents in the Plains States left during the 1930s.&lt;ref name=DustBowlPBS&gt;{{cite web|title=Mass Exodus from the Plains|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/americanexperience/features/general-article/dustbowl-mass-exodus-plains/|publisher=PBS|accessdate=13 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; More recently, drought in Syria from 2006-2011 has prompted a rural exodus to major urban centers. Massive influxes in urban areas, combined with difficult living conditions, have prompted some scholars to link the drought to the arrival of the Arab Spring in Syria.&lt;ref name=Syria&gt;{{cite news|last=Aukalh|first=R.|title=A rural exodus as drought takes hold of Syria|url=https://www.thestar.com/news/world/2013/03/16/a_rural_exodus_as_drought_takes_hold_of_syria.html|accessdate=13 March 2014|newspaper=Toronto Star|date=16 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In the United States and Canada==
{{see also|Depopulation of the Great Plains}}
The terms are used in the [[United States]] and [[Canada]] to describe the flight of people from rural areas in the [[Great Plains]] and [[Midwest]] regions, and to a lesser extent rural areas of the northeast and southeast and Appalachia. It is also particularly noticeable in parts of [[Atlantic Canada]] (especially [[Newfoundland (island)|Newfoundland]]), since the [[collapse of the Atlantic northwest cod fishery|collapse of Atlantic cod fishing fields]] in 1992.

==China==
{{Main article|Migration in China}}
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Chinese migrant workers in a construction site.jpg|thumb|right|Migrant workers are working in a construction site.]] --&gt;
[[China]], like many other currently industrializing countries, has had a relatively late start to rural flight. Until 1983, the Chinese government, through the [[hukou system]], greatly restricted the ability of their citizens to internally migrate. Since 1983, the Chinese government has progressively lifted the restrictions on internal migration.

As with most examples of rural flight, several factors have led towards China’s massive urbanization. Income disparity, family pressure, surplus labor in rural areas due to higher average fertility rates, and improved living conditions all play a role in contributing to the flows of migrants from rural to urban areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Labour Migration|url=http://www.ilo.org/beijing/areas-of-work/labour-migration/lang--en/index.htm|publisher=International labour organization|accessdate=18 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Approximately, 250 million rural migrants now live in cities with 54% of the total Chinese population living in urban areas.&lt;ref name=Economist&gt;{{Cite journal|title=China's cities: The Great Transition|journal=The Economist|url=https://www.economist.com/news/leaders/21599360-government-right-reform-hukou-system-it-needs-be-braver-great|accessdate=18 April 2014|date=2014-03-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Germany==
===Middle ages===
Rural flight has been occurring to some degree in Germany since the 11th century. A corresponding principle of German law is ''[[Stadtluft macht frei]]'' ("city air makes you free"), in longer form ''Stadtluft macht frei nach Jahr und Tag'' ("city air makes you free after a year and a day"): by custom and, from 1231/32, by statute, a [[serf]] who had spent a year and a day in a city was free, and could not be reclaimed by their former master.

===German ''Landflucht''===
{{Main article|Landflucht}}
''[[Landflucht]]'' ("flight from the land") refers to the mass [[Human migration|migration]] of peasants into the cities that occurred in [[Germany]] (and throughout most of Europe) in the late 19th century.

In 1870 the rural population of Germany constituted 64% of the population; by 1907 it had shrunk to 33%.&lt;ref name= "Schapiro, Shotwell p. 300"&gt;SchapiroShotwell; 1922, p. 300.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1900 alone, the Prussian provinces of [[East Prussia]], [[West Prussia]], [[Province of Posen|Posen]], [[Silesia]], and [[Pomerania]] lost about 1,600,000 people to the cities,&lt;ref name= "Kirk p. 139"&gt;Kirk1969, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt; where these former agricultural workers were absorbed into the rapidly growing factory labor class;&lt;ref name= "Mises p. 8"&gt;Mises2006, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt; One of the causes of this mass-migration was the decrease in rural income compared to the rates of pay in the cities.&lt;ref name= "Shafir p. 150"&gt;Shafir 1996, p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt;

Landflucht resulted in a major transformation of the German countryside and agriculture. [[Mechanized agriculture]] and migrant workers, particularly Poles from the east (Sachsengänger), became more common. This was especially true in the [[province of Posen]] that was [[Prussian partition|gained by Prussia]] when [[partitions of Poland|Poland was partitioned]].&lt;ref name= "Shafir p. 150"/&gt; The Polish population of eastern Germany was one of the justifications for the creation of the "[[Polish corridor]]" after World War I and the absorption of the land east of the [[Oder-Neisse line]] into Poland after World War II. Also, some labor-intensive enterprises were replaced by much less labor-intensive ones such as [[game preserve]]s.&lt;ref name= "Drage p. 77"&gt;Drage 1909, p. 77.&lt;/ref&gt;

The word ''Landflucht'' has negative connotations in German, as it was coined by agricultural employers, often of the German aristocracy, who were lamenting their labor shortages.&lt;ref name= "Mises p. 8"/&gt;&lt;ref name= "McLean, Kromkowski p. 56"&gt;McLean, Kromkowski 1991, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sweden==
Rural flight and out-migration in Sweden can be traced in two distinct waves. The first, beginning in the 1850s when 82% of the Swedish population lived in rural areas, and continuing till the late 1880s, was mostly due to push factors in the countryside related to poverty, unemployment, low agricultural wages, debt peonage, semi-feudalism, and religious oppression by the State church. Most of the migration was ad-hoc and directed towards emigration to the three big cities of Sweden, America, Denmark, or Germany. Many of these first emigrants were unskilled, barely literate laborers who sought farm work or daily wage labour in the cities.

The second wave started from the late 1890s and reached its peak between 1922 and 1967, with the highest rates of rural flight occurring in the 1920s and the 1950s. This was mostly "pull factors" due to the economic boom and industrial prosperity in Sweden wherein the massive economic expansion and wage increases in the urban areas pulled young people to migrate for work and at the same time drove down work opportunities in the countryside. Between 1925 and 1965, Sweden's GDP per capita increased from USD 850 to USD 6200. Simultaneously, the percentage of the population living in rural areas decreased drastically from 54% in 1925 to 21% in 1965.

== Russia and the former Soviet states ==
Rural flight began later for [[Russia]] and the former states of the [[USSR]] than in [[Western Europe]]. In 1926 only 18% of Russians lived in urban areas, compared to over 75% at the same time in the United Kingdom. Although the process began later, throughout World War II and the decades immediately proceeding, rural flight proceeded at a rapid pace. By 1965, 53% of Russians lived in urban areas.&lt;ref name=Wadekin&gt;{{cite journal|last= Wadekin|first= Karl-Eugen|title= Internal Migration and the Flight from the Land in USSR|journal= Soviet Studies|date= October 1966|volume= 18|issue= 2|pages= 131–152|jstor= 149517|doi= 10.1080/09668136608410523}}&lt;/ref&gt; Statistics compiled by M. Ya Sonin, a Soviet author, in 1959, demonstrate the rapid [[urbanization]] of the [[USSR]]. Between 1939 and 1959, the rural population declined by 21.3 million, while that of urban centers increased by 39.4 million. Of this dramatic shift in population, rural flight accounts for more than 60% of the change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last= Sonin|first= M. Ya.|title= Vosproizvodstvo rabochei sily v SSSR i balans truda|date= March 1959|page= 144}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, most rural migrants tended to settle in cities and towns within their district.&lt;ref name=Wadekin /&gt;  Rural flight persisted through the majority of the 20th century. However, with the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union|end of the Soviet Union]], rural flight reversed as political and economic instability in the cities prompted many urban dwellers to return to rural villages.&lt;ref name=Wegren&gt;{{cite journal|last= Wegren|first= Stephen K.|title= Rural Migration and Agrarian Reform in Russia: A Research Note|journal= Europe-Asia Studies|date= July 1995|volume= 47|issue= 5|pages= 877–888|jstor= 152691|doi= 10.1080/09668139508412292|pmid= 12320195}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Novospasskoe1.jpg|thumb|The defunct church in the abandoned village Novospasskoye, [[Saratov Oblast]], Russia]]

Rural flight did not occur uniformly throughout the USSR. Western Russia and [[Ukraine]] experienced the greatest declines in rural population, 30% and 17% respectively. Conversely, peripheral regions of the USSR, like [[Central Asia]], experienced gains, contradicting the general pattern of rural-urban migration of this period. Increased diversification of crops and labor shortages were primary contributors to the gains in rural population in the periphery.&lt;ref name=Wadekin /&gt;

Rural flight in Russia and the former USSR had several major determinants. The industrialization of agriculture, which came later in Russia and the former USSR, led to declines in available rural jobs. Lower living standards and tough work also motivated some peasants to migrate to urban areas.&lt;ref name=Wadekin /&gt; In particular, the Soviet ''[[kolkhoz]]'' system (the collective farms in the Soviet Union) aided in maintaining low living standards for Soviet peasants. Beginning around 1928, the [[kolkhoz]] system replaced [[family farm]]s throughout the Soviet Union. Forced to work long hours for low pay at rates fixed by the government and often unadjusted to [[inflation]], Russian peasants experienced quite low living-conditions - especially compared to urban life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last= Editors of the Encyclopædia Britannica|title= kolkhoz|url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/321400/kolkhoz|publisher= Encyclopædia Britannica|accessdate= 29 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;   While [[Brezhnev]]'s wage reforms in 1965 ameliorated the low wages received by peasants, rural life remained suffocating, especially for the skilled and the educated.&lt;ref name=Wegren /&gt; 
[[File:Menkovo - abandoned post office - DSCF5841.JPG|thumb|An abandoned post office in [[Menkovo]], [[Yaroslavl Oblast]], Russia]]

Although migrants came from all segments of society, several groups were more likely to migrate than others. Like other examples of rural flight, the young were more likely than the old to migrate to the cities. Young women under 20 were the most likely segment of the population to leave rural life. This exodus of young women further exacerbated the demographic transitions occurring in rural communities as the rate of natural increase dropped precipitously over the course of the 20th century. Lastly, the skilled and educated were also likely to migrate to urban areas.&lt;ref name=Wadekin /&gt;&lt;ref name=Wegren /&gt;

== Mexico ==
Rural flight in Mexico occurred throughout the 1930s up until the present day. Like other developing nations, the beginning of industrialization in Mexico quickly accelerated the rate of rural flight.&lt;ref name=Arizpe&gt;{{cite journal|last=Arizpe|first=Lourdes|title=The Rural Exodus in Mexico and Mexican Migration to the United States|journal=International Migration Review|date=Winter 1981|volume=15|issue=4|pages=626–649|jstor=2545516|doi=10.2307/2545516}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1930s, President [[Lázaro Cárdenas|Cardenas]] implemented a series of agricultural reforms that led to massive redistribution of agricultural land among the rural peasants. Some commentators have subsequently dubbed the period from 1940-1965 as the "Golden Era for Mexican Migration."&lt;ref name=Arizpe /&gt;  During this period, Mexican agriculture grew at an average rate of 5.7% outpacing the natural increase of 3% of the rural population. Concurrently, government policies favoring industrialization led to a massive increase of industrial jobs in the cities. Statistics compiled in [[Mexico City]] demonstrate this trend with over 1.8 million jobs created over the course of the 1940s, 50s, and 60s.&lt;ref name=Arizpe /&gt; Young people with schooling were the segment of population most likely to migrate away from rural life to urban life, attracted by the promise of many jobs and a more modern lifestyle as compared to the conservative conditions in rural villages. Additionally, due to the large demand for new workers, many of these jobs had low entrance requirements that also provided on-site job training opening the avenue for [[human migration|migration]] to many rural residents. From 1940 to about 1965, rural flight occurred in a slow, yet steady pace with both agriculture and industry growing concurrently.&lt;ref name=Arizpe /&gt;

However, as government policies increasingly favored industry over agriculture, rural conditions began to deteriorate. In 1957, the Mexican government began to regulate the price of maize through massive imports in order to keep low urban food costs.&lt;ref name=Arizpe /&gt;  This regulation severely undercut the market price of [[maize]] lowering the profit margins of small farmers. At the same time, the [[Green Revolution]] had entered into Mexican agriculture. Inspired by the work of [[Norman Borlaug]], farmers that employed hybrid seeds and fertilizer supplements were able to double or even triple their yields per acre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Thurow|first=Roger|title=Enough: Why the World's Poorest Starve in an Age of Plenty|year=2009|publisher=PublicAffairs|location=New York, NY|author2=Kilman, Scott }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Unfortunately, these products came at a relatively high cost, out of the reach of many farmers struggling after the devaluation of the price of maize. The combined effects of the maize price regulation and the Green Revolution was the consolidation of small farms into larger estates.&lt;ref name=Shaw&gt;{{cite journal|last=Shaw|first=R. Paul|title=Land Tenure and the Rural Exodus in Latin America|journal=Economic Development and Cultural Change|date=October 1974|volume=23|issue=1|pages=123–132|jstor=1153146|doi=10.1086/450773}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 1974 study conducted by Osorio concluded that in 1960, about 50.3% of the individual land plots in Mexico contained less than 5 hectares of land. In contrast, the top 0.5% of estates by land spanned 28.3% of all arable land. As many small farmers lost land, they either migrated to the cities or became migrant workers roving from large estate to large estate. Between 1950 and 1970, the proportion of migrant workers increased from 36.7% to 54% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Osorio|first=S.R|title=Estructura Agrariay Desarrollo Agricola en Mexico|journal=Mexico: Fondo de Cultura Economica|year=1974}}&lt;/ref&gt; The centralized pattern of industrial development and government policies overwhelmingly favoring industrialization contributed to massive rural flight in Mexico beginning in the late 1960s until the present day.&lt;ref name=Arizpe /&gt;

==Consequences of rural flight==
Rural migrants to cities face several challenges that may hinder their quality of life upon moving into urbanized areas. Many migrants do not have the education or skills to acquire decent jobs in cities and are then forced into unstable, low paying jobs. The steady stream of new rural migrants worsens underemployment and unemployment, common among rural migrants. Employers offer lower wages and poorer labor conditions to rural migrants, who must compete with each other for limited jobs, often unaware of their labor rights. Rural migrants often experience poor living conditions as well. Many cities have exploded in population; services and infrastructure, in these cities, are unable to keep up with population growth. Massive influxes in rural population can lead to severe housing shortages, inadequate water and energy supply, and general slum-like conditions throughout cities.&lt;ref name=Weeks /&gt;&lt;ref name=Youth /&gt;

Additionally, rural migrants often struggle adjusting to city life. In some instances, there are cultural differences between the rural and urban areas of a region. Lost in urban regions, it becomes difficult for them to continue holding onto their cultural traditions. Urban residents may also look down upon these newcomers to the city who are often unaware of city social norms. Both marginalized and separated from their home cultures, migrants face many social challenges when moving to cities.&lt;ref name=Youth /&gt;

Women, in particular, face a unique set of challenges. Some women undergo rural flight to escape domestic abuse or forced early marriages. Some parents choose to send women to cities to find jobs in order to send remittances back home. Once in the city, employers may attempt to take advantage of these women preying on their unfamiliarity with labor laws and social networks on which to rely. In the worst of cases, destitution may force women into prostitution, exposing them to social stigma and the risks of sexually transmitted diseases.&lt;ref name=Youth /&gt;

He is standing with a fan in his right hand and with his left hand resting on books on a table.|[[Henry Savile (Bible translator)|Sir Henry Savile]], founder of the professorship]]
The position of '''Savilian Professor of Astronomy''' was established at the [[University of Oxford]] in 1619.  It was founded (at the same time as the [[Savilian Professor of Geometry|Savilian Professorship of Geometry]]) by [[Henry Savile (Bible translator)|Sir Henry Savile]], a mathematician and classical scholar who was [[Warden of Merton College, Oxford]], and [[Provost of Eton College]]. He appointed [[John Bainbridge (astronomer)|John Bainbridge]] as the first professor, who took up his duties in 1620 or 1621.

There have been 21 astronomy professors in all; [[Steven Balbus]], the professor {{as of|2015|lc=1}}, was appointed in 2012. Past professors include [[Christopher Wren]] (1661–73), architect of [[St Paul's Cathedral]] in London and the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] in Oxford; he held the professorship at the time of his commission to rebuild the cathedral after it was destroyed by the [[Great Fire of London]] in 1666.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www-history.mcs.st-andrews.ac.uk/Biographies/Wren.html|title=Wren biography|first1=J J |last1=O'Connor |first2=E F |last2=Robertson|publisher=University of St Andrews|date=February 2002|accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Three professors have been awarded the [[Gold Medal of the Royal Astronomical Society]]: [[Charles Pritchard]] (1870–93), [[Harry Hemley Plaskett|Harry Plaskett]] (1932–60) and [[Joseph Silk]] (1999–2012). The two Savilian chairs have been linked with professorial [[Oxbridge Fellow|fellowships]] at [[New College, Oxford]], since the late 19th century. In the past, some of the professors were provided with an official residence, either near New College or at the [[Radcliffe Observatory]], although this practice ended in the 19th century. The astronomy professor is a member of the Sub-Department of Astrophysics at Oxford.

==Foundation and duties==
[[Henry Savile (Bible translator)|Sir Henry Savile]], the [[Warden of Merton College, Oxford]], and [[Provost of Eton College]], was deeply saddened by what the 20th-century mathematician [[Ida Busbridge]] has described as "the wretched state of mathematical studies in England",&lt;ref name=Maths1&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.maths.ox.ac.uk/about-us/history|title=Oxford Mathematics and Mathematicians|first=I.

Tuition in [[trigonometry]] was to be shared by the two professors.  As many students would have had little mathematical knowledge, the professors were also permitted to provide instruction in basic mathematics in English (as opposed to Latin, the language used in education at Oxford at the time).&lt;ref name=Savile/&gt; He also required the astronomy professor "to take astronomical observations as well by night as by day (making choice of proper instruments prepared for the purpose, and at fitting times and seasons)", and to place in the library records of his discoveries.&lt;ref name=Laud/&gt;  Savile prohibited the professors from practicing astrology or preparing horoscopes, and stated that accepting any position as a priest or as an officer of the university or of a college would cause forfeiture of the professorship. Each professor was required to lecture in public for 45&amp;nbsp;minutes twice weekly during the university terms and would be fined 10&amp;nbsp;shillings for every day missed (except in cases of "grievous bodily ailment", although this excuse was only permitted for three weeks before the professor was required to provide a substitute lecturer).&lt;ref name=Laud/&gt; Students who were required to attend, but who failed to do without good cause, were to be fined sixpence.

==Appointment==
Savile selected [[John Bainbridge (astronomer)|John Bainbridge]] to be the first astronomy professor; Bainbridge had impressed him with a description of a comet seen in 1618.&lt;ref name=Savile/&gt; In the documents establishing the professorship ([[Seal (emblem)|sealed]] by Savile and the university in August 1619), Savile reserved to himself the right to appoint the professors during his lifetime, although he died in 1622 before the position fell vacant.  He provided that after his death, vacancies should be filled by a majority of a group of "most distinguished persons":&lt;ref name=ch6/&gt; the [[Archbishop of Canterbury]], the [[Lord Chancellor]], the [[Chancellor of the University of Oxford|Chancellor of the university]], the [[Bishop of London]], the [[Secretary of State (England)|Secretary of State]], the [[Chief Justice of the Common Pleas]], the [[Chief Justice of the King's Bench]], the [[Chief Baron of the Exchequer]] and the [[Dean of Arches|Dean of the Court of Arches]]. The [[Vice-Chancellor of the University of Oxford|Vice-Chancellor of the university]] was to inform the electors of any vacancy, and could be summoned to advise them.  The appointment could either be made straight away, or delayed for some months to see whether "any eminent mathematician can be allured" from abroad.&lt;ref name=ch6&gt;{{cite book|title=Oxford University Statutes Volume 1 – containing the Caroline Code or Laudian Statutes promulgated A.D. 1630|others=trans.

As part of reforms of the university in the 19th century, the University of Oxford commissioners laid down new statutes for the chair in 1881, replacing Savile's original instructions and requirements. The 1881&amp;nbsp;statute provided that the professor was to "lecture and give instruction in theoretical and practical Astronomy", and was to be a [[Oxbridge Fellow|Fellow]] of [[New College, Oxford|New College]].&lt;ref name=Statute/&gt; The electors for the professorship were to be the Warden of New College (or a person nominated by the college in his place), the Chancellor of the university, the President of the [[Royal Society]], the [[Astronomer Royal]], the [[Radcliffe Observatory#Radcliffe Observers|Radcliffe Observer]], a person nominated by the university council and one other nominated by New College.&lt;ref name=Statute&gt;{{cite book| url=https://archive.org/stream/statutesmadeforu00univuoft#page/70/mode/2up|title=Statutes made for the University of Oxford and for the Colleges and Halls therein, in pursuance of the Universities of Oxford and Cambridge Act, 1877, approved by the Queen in Council|date=1883|publisher=[[Clarendon Press]]|pages=70, 372}}&lt;/ref&gt; Changes to the university's internal legislation in the 20th and early 21st centuries abolished specific statutes for the duties of, and rules for appointment to, individual chairs such as the Savilian professorships.

==Professors' houses==
Two official residences have been provided for the astronomy professor.  The first was in [[New College Lane]], in central Oxford.  [[John Wallis]] (geometry professor 1649–1703) rented a house there from New College from 1672 until his death in 1703; at some point, it was divided into two houses.  Towards the end of his life, [[David Gregory (mathematician)|David Gregory]] (astronomy professor 1691–1708) lived in the eastern part of the premises.  Wallis's son gave the unexpired portion of the lease to the university in 1704 in honour of his father's long tenure of the geometry chair, to provide official residences for the two Savilian professors. New College renewed the lease at a low rent from 1716 and thereafter at intervals until the last renewal in 1814. Records of who lived in each house are not available throughout the period, but surviving documentation shows that the professors often sub-let the houses and that for about twenty years in the early 18th century the premises were being used as a lodging house.&lt;ref name=house&gt;{{cite journal|title=The Savilian Professors' Houses and Halley's Observatory at Oxford|first=H.

The second official residence was built during the time of [[Thomas Hornsby]] (astronomy professor 1763–1810), who proposed that an observatory should be built at a site to the north of the city centre. In 1772, construction began of the [[Radcliffe Observatory]] and an adjoining house for the astronomy professor, to which Hornsby moved.&lt;ref name=Hornsby/&gt; Thereafter the university sub-let his former residence.  Both of his successors, [[Abraham Robertson]] (1810–27) and [[Stephen Peter Rigaud|Stephen Rigaud]] (1827–39), were the geometry professor at their appointment to the astronomy chair, and in turn they moved from New College Lane to the Radcliffe Observatory. The university then sub-let the astronomy professor's house.&lt;ref name=house/&gt; The link between the professorship and the observatory was broken in 1839 with the appointment of [[George Johnson (priest)|George Johnson]]; he had little practical astronomical experience and the officers in charge of the observatory appointed [[Manuel Johnson (astronomer)|Manuel Johnson]] as Radcliffe Observer instead. In the early 19th century, New College decided that it wished to use the properties for itself and the lease expired without renewal in 1854.&lt;ref name=house/&gt; [[Charles Pritchard]] (1870–93) had a new observatory built in the [[University Parks]], but his attempts to persuade the university to add a residence for the Savilian professor were unsuccessful.&lt;ref name=Pritchard/&gt;

|Bainbridge practised as a physician in Leicestershire and London after leaving Cambridge. His first book, ''An Astronomicall Description of the Late Comet'', was published in 1619 and described the comet of the previous year. He was already known by this time to [[Henry Savile (Bible translator)|Sir Henry Savile]] and [[Henry Briggs (mathematician)|Henry Briggs]] (who Savile appointed as his first [[Savilian Professor of Geometry|geometry professor]]). After his appointment to the chair, Bainbridge also lectured and practised in medicine.

|When still an undergraduate, Ward impressed [[John Bainbridge (astronomer)|John Bainbridge]] (the first astronomy professor) during a mathematical disputation. Ward was appointed as university lecturer in mathematics at Cambridge in 1643, but was deprived of his [[Oxbridge Fellow|fellowship]] in the following year for refusing to agree to the religious oaths required by the [[Roundhead|Parliamentary]] authorities. He spent the following years tutoring and improving his mathematical knowledge, before succeeding his friend [[John Greaves]] in the Savilian chair, with Greaves's assistance. University lectures in astronomy were resumed under Ward, who was the first Savilian professor to teach the [[Copernican heliocentrism|Copernican]] discovery that the Earth and other planets revolved around the Sun. He studied comets and the movements of the planets, observing them from the room at the top of the tower of Wadham College in which he lived; he also preached and published theological works. He was elected [[List of Principals and Fellows of Jesus College, Oxford|Principal of Jesus College, Oxford]], in 1657, but [[Oliver Cromwell]] installed [[Francis Howell]] instead, raising Ward's stipend as compensation. He was President of [[Trinity College, Oxford]], from 1659 but resigned 1660 at [[The Restoration]] in favour of his ejected predecessor; he also gave up the professorship in the same year.

[[Oliver Cromwell]] appointed Wren in 1657 as [[Gresham Professor of Astronomy|Professor of Geometry]] at [[Gresham College]], London, on the recommendation of Wilkins; Wren lectured on [[Saturn]] (the appearance and phases of which he had earlier studied), [[Kepler]]'s works, light, and lenses. He provided partial solutions in 1658 to problems relating to curves set by [[Blaise Pascal]], the answers to which would help calculations for planetary orbits. He resigned from Gresham College upon his appointment to the Savilian chair, lecturing on topics such as spheres and navigation. He developed an interest in architecture from his mathematical studies, with early work including the chapel of [[Pembroke College, Cambridge]], and the [[Sheldonian Theatre]] in Oxford.

|Bradley was the nephew of [[James Pound]], a leading astronomer who was a colleague of [[Edmond Halley]] and [[Isaac Newton]], and helped his uncle with his observations near London even when Bradley was appointed as vicar of a church in [[Monmouthshire]]. He had a particular interest in the [[moons of Jupiter]], correcting errors in published astronomical tables, [[Mars]] and [[nebulae]], and was highly regarded by Halley.  Bradley resigned as a clergyman on appointment to the chair in 1721. His major discovery, in 1725, was the [[aberration of light]], in which stars appeared to move position as the earth moved, which led him to be able to calculate the speed of light and the time it took to travel from the Sun to the Earth.  He moved to the Savilian professors' house in 1732, and succeeded Halley as [[Astronomer Royal]] in 1742, improving the state of the buildings and instruments at the [[Greenwich Royal Observatory|Greenwich observatory]]. His continued observations on the positions of the stars (to help with navigation), the moon, and comets led to the discovery of [[nutation]]: the "nodding" of the Earth on its axis as it travelled around the Sun.  He recorded observations for 18 years to measure the phenomenon, which helped to show (as Newton argued) that the earth was flatter at the poles. He was awarded the [[Copley Medal]] of the [[Royal Society]] for this work. He carried on his astronomical observations, receiving many honours from home and abroad, until his death in 1762. Legal disputes about whether the state or his inheritors owned his papers led to a long delay in publication of his papers, but they eventually formed the starting point for further important work about the positions of the stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mari E.

|Rigaud, whose father was the observer at [[Kew Observatory]], made his first recorded observations in astronomy when at Exeter College, and was elected to a [[Oxbridge Fellow|fellowship]] of the college when still an undergraduate.

When [[Abraham Robertson]] succeeded Hornsby in 1810, Rigaud was appointed as [[Savilian Professor of Geometry]]; he succeeded his father at Kew in 1814, becoming joint observer with his grandfather. He succeeded Robertson in the astronomy and experimental philosophy positions in 1827.

He supported the decision of the Radcliffe trustees to move their observatory to a better site, in South Africa, in 1929, but was attacked by fellow Oxford academics in the struggles for improving science facilities at the university thereafter.

During this time he met the Oxford mathematician and astrophysicist [[Edward Arthur Milne]], and they became close friends. On the death of [[Herbert Hall Turner|Herbert Turner]] in 1930, Milne warned Plaskett about the antiquated observatory at Oxford and the lack of university support and resources for the work of the Savilian professor, but Plaskett was undeterred and was appointed to the position. He constructed England's first solar tower telescope to attract new researchers to Oxford, and reduced the work carried out at the observatory on seismology that Turner had begun, eliminating it in 1946. He ended undergraduate tuition at the observatory and, with Milne, set up the first school of astrophysics in the country, based on the teaching of graduate students through research initiatives. He retired in 1960, but continued his observations with his successor's permission until he turned eighty in 1973.

'''Stanisław Kuczborski''' (January 31, 1912 &amp;ndash; August 23, 2004) was a [[Poles|Polish]] [[pulmonology|pulmonologist]].

Kuczborski obtained his high school diploma in 1930, at the Mikołaj Kopernik Boys’ High School in [[Łódź]]. In 1930 he began his studies at the Medical Department of the [[Warsaw University]]. As a student, he contracted [[tuberculosis]] and was referred to Warsaw University's [[Sanatorium]] in [[Zakopane]]. This experience caused him to focus his medical studies. After he finished a one-year postgraduate internship in [[Warsaw]] hospitals, he worked in a sanatorium in [[Otwock]], near Warsaw. There he expanded work in the field of [[internal medicine]], particularly [[Physical medicine and rehabilitation]] (PM&amp;R), or physiatry. He spent the years during the Nazi occupation in the sanatorium. After [[World War II]], he returned to his home city of Łódź. In 1951, he received his [[PhD]] from the [[Medical University of Silesia]].

As a [[physician]], Kuczborski was a [[lung|pulmonary]] and physiatric consultant. His career was mainly associated with Łódź; only after from 1952 to 1955, did he reside in Warsaw serving as the deputy director of the Tuberculosis Institute in Warsaw. Kuczborski held posts as director of several hospitals in Łódź. He also established a laboratory of physiopathology of breathing, the first in the Łódź region and one of the first in Poland. He also was the director of the Lung Disease Hospital in Łagiewniki until he retired in 1977.

He held foreign (Denmark, France) scientific internships mainly in the field of functional tests and rehabilitation of the respiratory system. He was an honorary member of the International Union against Tuberculosis and Lung Disease located in Paris. In Poland, he received an honorary membership of the Polish Physiatry and Pulmonology Association. Kuczborski published 70 works, mainly on tuberculosis (TB) chemotherapy, physiopathology of breathing, rehabilitation and intensive care of the respiratory system diseases.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

'''Symbolic interactionism''' is a sociological theory that develops from practical considerations and alludes to people's particular utilization of [[dialect]] to make images and normal implications, for [[deductive reasoning|deduction]] and [[correspondence theory of truth|correspondence]] with others.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hall|first=Peter M.|year=2007|title=Symbolic Interaction|url=http://www.blackwellreference.com/subscriber/tocnode.html?id=g9781405124331_chunk_g978140512433125_ss1-310|journal=Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology|volume=|pages=|via=Blackwell Encyclopedia of Sociology}}&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, it is a frame of reference to better understand how individuals interact with one another to create symbolic worlds, and in return, how these worlds [[Socialization|shape individual behaviors]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Introducing communication theory : analysis and application|last=West|first=Richard L.|last2=Turner|first2=Lynn H.|publisher=|others=|year=|isbn=9781259870323|edition=6th|location=New York, NY|pages=|oclc=967775008}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is a framework that helps understand how society is preserved and created through repeated interactions between individuals. The interpretation process that occurs between interactions help create and recreate meaning. It is the shared understanding and interpretations of meaning that affect the interaction between individuals. Individuals act on the premise of a shared understanding of meaning within their social context.Thus, interaction and behavior is framed through the shared meaning that objects and concepts have attached to them.   

Symbolic interactionism comes from a [[sociology|sociological]] perspective which developed around the middle of the twentieth century and that continues to be influential in some areas of the discipline. It is particularly important in [[microsociology]] and [[Social psychology (sociology)|social psychology]]. It is derived from the American philosophy of [[pragmatism]] and particularly from the work of [[George Herbert Mead]], as a pragmatic method to interpret social interactions.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Caglar|first=Sebnem|last2=Alver|first2=Fusun|date=2015|title=The Impact of Symbolic Interactionism on Research Studies about Communication Science|url=https://search-proquest-com.proxy.library.georgetown.edu/docview/1768593872?accountid=11091#|journal=International Journal of Arts and Sciences|volume=8|pages=479–484|via=Proquest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

=== George Herbert Mead ===

Symbolic interaction was conceived by [[George Herbert Mead]] and [[Charles Horton Cooley]]. Mead argued that people's selves are social products, but that these selves are also [[Purposive behaviorism|purposive]] and creative, and believed that the true test of any theory was that it was "useful in solving complex social problems".&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/875554087|title=A first look at communication theory|last=Griffin|first=Emory A.|last2=Ledbetter|first2=Andrew|last3=Sparks|first3=Glenn Grayson|publisher=McGraw-Hill Education|others=|year=2015|isbn=9780073523927|edition= 9th|location=New York|pages=|oclc=875554087}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mead's influence was said to be so powerful that sociologists regard him as the one "true founder" of the symbolic interactionism tradition. Although Mead taught in a philosophy department, he is best known by sociologists as the teacher who trained a generation of the best minds in their field. Strangely, he never set forth his wide-ranging ideas in a book or systematic treatise. After his death in 1931, his students pulled together class notes and conversations with their mentor and published ''[[Mind, Self and Society]]'' in his name.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; It is a common misconception that [[John Dewey]] was the leader of this sociological theory; according to ''The Handbook of Symbolic Interactionism,'' Mead was undoubtedly the individual who "transformed the inner structure of the theory, moving it to a higher level of theoretical complexity".&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/51059349|title=Handbook of symbolic interactionism|last=|first=|date=2003|publisher=AltaMira Press|others=Reynolds, Larry T., Herman-Kinney, Nancy J., 1958-|year=|isbn=0759100926|location=Walnut Creek, CA|pages=|oclc=51059349}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Mind, Self and Society'' is the book published by Mead's students based on his lectures and teaching, and the title of the book highlights the core concept of social interactionism. ''Mind'' refers to an individual's ability to use symbols to create meanings for the world around the individual – individuals use language and thought to accomplish this goal. ''Self'' refers to an individual's ability to reflect on the way that the individual is perceived by others. Finally, ''society'', according to Mead, is where all of these interactions are taking place. A general description of Mead's compositions portray how outside [[social structure]]s, [[Social class|classes]], and [[Power (social and political)|power]] and abuse affect the advancement of self, personality for gatherings verifiably denied of the ability to characterize themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Brewster|first=Kiyona|date=August 2013|year=|title=Beyond Classic Symbolic Interactionism: Towards A Intersectional Reading Of George H.

[[Herbert Blumer]], a student and interpreter of Mead, coined the term and put forward an influential summary: people act a certain way towards things based on the meaning those things already have, and these meanings are derived from social interaction and modified through interpretation.&lt;ref name="SSSI"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/site/sssinteraction/|title=Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction|last=Williams|first=Patrick|last2=vom Lehn|first2=Dirk|date=|work=sites.google.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Blumer was a [[Social constructionism|social constructionist]], and was influenced by [[John Dewey]]; as such, this theory is very [[Phenomenology (philosophy)|phenomenologically]]-based. Given that Blumer was the first to use symbolic interaction as a term, he is known as the founder of symbolic interaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Aksan|first=Nilgun|last2=Kısac|first2=Buket|last3=Aydın|first3=Mufit|last4=Demirbuken|first4=Sumeyra|date=2009-01-01|title=Symbolic interaction theory|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1877042809001633|journal=Procedia - Social and Behavioral Sciences|series=World Conference on Educational Sciences: New Trends and Issues in Educational Sciences|volume=1|issue=1|pages=902–904|doi=10.1016/j.sbspro.2009.01.160}}&lt;/ref&gt; He believed that the "Most human and humanizing activity that people engage in is talking to each other."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; According to Blumer, human groups are created by people and it is only actions between them that define a society.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/18071|title=Symbolic interactionism: perspective and method|last=Blumer|first=Herbert|date=1969|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=|isbn=0138799245|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|pages=|oclc=18071}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that with interaction and through interaction individuals are able to "produce common symbols by approving, arranging, and redefining them."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Having said that, interaction is shaped by a mutual exchange of interpretation, the ground of socialization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Other theorists===

Two other theorists who have influenced symbolic interaction theory are Yrjö Engeström and David Middleton. Engeström and Middleton explained the usefulness of symbolic interactionism in the communication field in a variety of work settings, including "courts of law, health care, computer software design, scientific laboratory, telephone sales, control, repair, and maintenance of advanced manufacturing systems".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/41578004|title=Cognition and communication at work|last=Middleton|first=David|last2=Engeström|first2=Yrjö|date=1998|publisher=Cambridge University Press|others=|year=|isbn=0521645662|edition= Paperback|location=Cambridge|pages=|oclc=41578004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other scholars credited for their contribution to the theory are Thomas, Park, James, Horton Cooley, [[Florian Znaniecki|Znaniecki]], Baldwin, Redfield, and Wirth.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Unlike other social sciences, symbolic interactionism emphasizes greatly on the ideas of action instead of culture, class and power. According to [[behaviorism]], [[Darwinism]], [[pragmatism]], as well as [[Max Weber]], [[Action theory (philosophy)|action theory]] contributed significantly to the formation of social interactionism as a theoretical perspective in [[communication studies]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Assumptions, premises, and research methodology==
=== Assumptions ===
Most symbolic interactionists believe a physical reality does indeed exist by an individual's social definitions, and that social definitions do develop in part or in relation to something "real". People thus do not respond to this reality directly, but rather to the [[Social reality|social understanding of reality]]; i.e., they respond to this reality indirectly through a kind of filter which consists of individuals' different perspectives. This means that humans exist not in the physical space composed of realities, but in the "world" composed only of "objects".

Three assumptions frame symbolic interactionism:&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# ''Individuals construct meaning via the communication process.''
# ''[[Self-concept]] is a motivation for behavior.''
# ''A unique relationship exists between the individual and society.'' 

Having defined some of the underlying assumptions of symbolic interactionism, it is necessary to address the premises that each assumption supports. According to Blumer, there are three premises that can be derived from the assumptions above.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

=== Premises ===
'''''Premise 1: "Humans act toward things on the basis of the meanings they ascribe to those things."'''''

The first premise includes everything that a human being may note in their world, including physical objects, actions and concepts. Essentially, individuals behave towards objects and others based on the personal meanings that the individual has already given these items. Blumer was trying to put emphasis on the meaning behind individual behaviors, specifically speaking, psychological and sociological explanations for those actions and behaviors.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''''Premise 2: "The meaning of such things is derived from, or arises out of, the social interaction that one has with others and the society."'''''

The second premise explains the meaning of such things is derived from, or arises out of, the social interaction that one has with other humans. Blumer, following Mead, claimed people interact with each other by interpreting or defining each other's actions instead of merely reacting to each other's actions. Their "response" is not made directly to the actions of one another but instead is based on the meaning which they attach to such actions. Thus, human interaction is mediated by the use of [[Significant symbols|symbols]] and [[Sign (semiotics)|signification]], by [[Language interpretation|interpretation]], or by ascertaining the meaning of one another's actions.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; [[Meaning (linguistics)|Meaning]] is either taken for granted and pushed aside as an unimportant element which need not to be investigated, or it is regarded as a mere neutral link or one of the [[causal chain]]s between the causes or factors responsible for human behavior and this behavior as the product of such factors.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

'''''Premise 3: "The Meanings are handled in, and modified through, an interpretative process used by the person in dealing with the things he/she encounters.'''''

Symbolic interactionists describe thinking as an [[Inner conversations|inner conversation]].&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Mead called this inner dialogue ''minding'', which is the delay in one's thought process that happens when one thinks about what they will do next. These meanings are handled in, and modified through, an interpretive process&lt;ref&gt;This process occurs in the form of ''interaction with oneself'' or  ''taking into account of taking into account''. See the following paper: Kuwabara T., and K. Yamaguchi, 2013, [http://gyo.tc/13ES0 An Introduction to the Sociological Perspective of Symbolic Interactionism], ''The Joint Journal of the National Universities in Kyushu, Education and Humanities'', 1(1), pp. 1-11.&lt;/ref&gt; used by the person in dealing with the things he encounters. We naturally talk to ourselves in order to sort out the meaning of a difficult situation. But first, we need language. Before we can think, we must be able to interact symbolically.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; The emphasis on symbols, negotiated meaning, and social construction of society brought attention to the [[role]]s people play. [[Role-taking theory|Role-taking]] is a key mechanism that permits people to see another person's perspective to understand what an action might mean to another person. Role-taking is a part of our lives at an early age, for instance, playing house and pretending to be someone else. There is an improvisational quality to roles; however, [[Free will|actors]] often take on a script that they follow. Because of the uncertainty of roles in social contexts, the burden of role-making is on the person in the situation. In this sense, we are proactive participants in our environment.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/356659|title=Studies in ethnomethodology|last=Garfinkel|first=Harold|date=1967|publisher=Prentice-Hall|year=|isbn=0745600050|location=Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|pages=|oclc=356659}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Research methodology ===
The majority of interactionist research uses [[qualitative research]] methods, like [[participant observation]], to study aspects of [[social interaction]], and/or individuals' selves. Participant observation allows researchers to access symbols and meanings, as in [[Howard S. Becker]]'s ''Art Worlds'' and [[Arlie Russell Hochschild|Arlie Hochschild]]'s ''[[The Managed Heart]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.encyclopedia.com/social-sciences-and-law/sociology-and-social-reform/sociology-general-terms-and-concepts/symbolic-interactionism#symbolicinteractionism|title=Symbolic Interactionism|last=|first=|date=|website=www.encyclopedia.com|language=en|others=International Encyclopedia of Marriage and Family|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2011-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They argue that close contact and immersion in the everyday activities of the participants is necessary for understanding the meaning of actions, defining situations and the process that actors construct the situation through their interaction. Because of this close contact, interactions cannot remain completely liberated of value commitments. In most cases, they make use of their values in choosing what to study; however, they seek to be objective in how they conduct the research. Therefore, the symbolic-interaction approach is a micro-level orientation focusing on human interaction in specific situations.

==Five central ideas==

There are five central ideas to symbolic interactionism according to [[Joel M. Charon]], author of ''Symbolic Interactionism An Introduction, An Interpretation, An Integration'':&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Symbolic Interactionism An Introduction, An Interpretation, An Integration |last=Charon |first=Joel M.|year=2004 |publisher=Pearson |location=Boston |isbn=978-0-13-605193-0 |page=31 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

#"The human being must be understood as a social person. It is the constant search for social interaction that leads us to do what we do. Instead of focusing on the individual and his or her personality, or on how the society or social situation causes human behavior, symbolic interactionism focuses on the activities that take place between actors. Interaction is the basic unit of study. Individuals are created through interaction; society too is created through social interaction. What we do depends on interaction with others earlier in our lifetimes, and it depends on our interaction right now. Social interaction is central to what we do. If we want to understand cause, focus on social interaction.
#The human being must be understood as a thinking being. Human action is not only interaction among individuals but also interaction within the individual. It is not our ideas or attitudes or values that are as important as the constant active ongoing process of thinking. We are not simply conditioned, we are not simply beings who are influenced by those around us, we are not simply products of society. We are, to our very core, thinking animals, always conversing with ourselves as we interact with others. If we want to understand cause, focus on human thinking.
#Humans do not sense their environment directly, instead, humans define the situation they are in. An environment may actually exist, but it is our definition of it that is important. Definition does not simply randomly happen; instead, it results from ongoing social interaction and thinking. 
#The cause of human action is the result of what is occurring in our present situation. Cause unfolds in the present social interaction, present thinking, and present definition. It is not society's encounters with us in our past, that causes action nor is it our own past experience that does. It is, instead, social interaction, thinking, definition of the situation that takes place in the present. Our past enters into our actions primarily because we think about it and apply it to the definition of the present situation. 
#Human beings are described as active beings in relation to their environment. Words such as conditioning, responding, controlled, imprisoned, and formed are not used to describe the human being in symbolic interaction. In contrast to other social-scientific perspectives humans are not thought of as being passive in relation to their surroundings, but actively involved in what they do."

==Central interactionist themes==
To Blumer's conceptual perspective, he put them in three core principles: that people act toward things, including each other, on the basis of the meanings they have for them; that these meanings are derived through social interaction with others; and that these meanings are managed and transformed through an interpretive process that people use to make sense of and handle the objects that constitute their social worlds. Keeping Blumer's earlier work in mind [[David A. Snow]], professor of sociology at the [[University of California, Irvine]], suggests four broader and even more basic orienting principles: human agency, interactive determination, symbolization, and emergence. Snow uses these four principles as the thematic bases for identifying and discussing contributions to the study of social movements.

;''Human agency''

[[Human agency]] emphasizes the active, willful, goal-seeking character of human actors. The emphasis on agency focuses attention on those actions, events, and moments in social life in which agentic action is especially palpable.

;''Interactive determination''
Interactive determination specifies that understanding of focal objects of analysis, whether they are self-concepts, identities, roles, practices, or even social movements. Basically this means, neither individual, society, self, or others exist only in relation to each other and therefore can be fully understood only in terms of their interaction.

;''Symbolization''
Symbolization highlights the processes through which events and conditions, artifacts, people, and other environmental features that take on particular meanings, becoming nearly only objects of orientation. Human behavior is partly contingent on what the object of orientation symbolizes or means.

;''Emergence''

[[Emergence]] focuses on attention on the processual and non-habituated side of social life, focusing not only on organization and texture of social life, but also associated meaning and feelings. The principal of emergence tells us not only to possibility of new forms of social life and system meaning but also to transformations in existing forms of social organization.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

==New media==

[[New media]] is a term used to define all that is related to the internet and the interplay between technology, images and sound.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newmedia.org/what-is-new-media.html|title=What is new media?|author=Bailey Socha|first=|author2=Barbara Eber-Schmid|date=|website=www.newmedia.org|publisher=|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121202100513/http://www.newmedia.org/what-is-new-media.html|archivedate=2 December 2012|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; As studies of online community proliferate, the concept of online community has become a more accepted social construct.

Whatever.] Shelley Dubois. ''Wired Magazine''. 30 June 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; These studies show that online community is an important social construct in terms of its cultural, structural, political and economic character.

It has been demonstrated that people's ideas about community are formed, in part, through interactions both in online forums and face-to-face. As a result, people act in their communities according to the meanings they derive about their environment, whether online or offline, from those interactions. This perspective reveals that online communication may very well take on different meanings for different people depending on information, circumstance, relationships, power, and other systems that make up [[communities of practice]]. People enact community the way it is conceived and the meaning of community evolves as they come up with new ways to utilize it. Given this reality, scholars are continually challenged to research and understand how online communities are comprised, how they function, and how they are connected to offline social life.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Fernback|first=Jan|date=February 2007|title=Beyond the diluted community concept: a symbolic interactionist perspective                 on online social relations|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444807072417|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=49–69|doi=10.1177/1461444807072417|issn=1461-4448|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Symbolic interaction theory was discussed in ''The Cyberself: The Self-ing Project goes online, Symbolic Interaction in the Digital Age''. Laura Robinson discusses how symbolic interaction theory explains the way individuals create a sense of self through their interactions with others. However, she believes advances in technology have changed this. The article investigates the manner in which individuals form their online identity. She uses symbolic interaction theory to examine the formation of the cyber "I" and a digital "generalized other". In the article, Robinson suggests individuals form new identities on the internet. She argues these cyber identities are not necessarily the way the individual would be perceived offline.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=Laura|date=February 2007|title=The cyberself: the self-ing project goes online, symbolic interaction in the                 digital age|url=https://doi.org/10.1177/1461444807072216|journal=New Media &amp; Society|language=en|volume=9|issue=1|pages=93–110|doi=10.1177/1461444807072216|issn=1461-4448|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticisms==
Symbolic interactionists are often criticized for being overly impressionistic in their research methods and somewhat unsystematic in their theories. It is argued that the theory is not one theory, but rather, the [[Conceptual framework|''framework'']] for many different theories. Additionally, some theorists have a problem with symbolic interaction theory due to its lack of [[testability]]. These objections, combined with the fairly narrow focus of interactionist research on small-group interactions and other social psychological issues, have relegated the interactionist camp to a minority position among sociologists (albeit a fairly substantial minority). Much of this criticism arose during the 1970s in the U.S. when [[quantitative research|quantitative]] approaches to sociology were dominant. Perhaps the best known of these is by [[Alvin Ward Gouldner|Alvin Gouldner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/16192914|title=The coming crisis of western sociology|last=Gouldner|first=Alvin Ward|date=1971|publisher=Heinemann|year=|isbn=0435821504|location=London|pages=|oclc=16192914}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Framework and theories===
Some critiques of symbolic interactionism are based on the assumption that it is a [[theory]], and the critiques apply the criteria for a "good" theory to something that does not claim to be a theory. Some critics find the symbolic interactionist framework too broad and general when they are seeking specific theories. Symbolic interactionism is a theoretical ''framework'' rather than a theory&lt;ref&gt;see Stryker and Vryan (2006) for a clear distinction between the two as it pertains to [[Interactionism|interactionist]]-inspired conceptualizations&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Handbook of Social Psychology|last=Stryker|first1=Sheldon|last2=Vryan|first2=Kevin D.|date=January 2006|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=3–28|chapter=The Symbolic Interactionist Frame|doi=10.1007/0-387-36921-X_1|issn=1389-6903|accessdate=2018-09-22|chapter-url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sheldon_Stryker/publication/227124775_The_Symbolic_Interactionist_Frame/links/559af21808ae99aa62ce2e01/The-Symbolic-Interactionist-Frame.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can be assessed on the basis of effective conceptualizations. The theoretical framework, as with any theoretical framework, is vague when it comes to analyzing [[empirical data]] or predicting outcomes in social life. As a framework rather than a theory, many scholars find it difficult to use. Interactionism being a framework rather than a theory makes it impossible to test interactionism in the manner that a specific theoretical claim about the relationship between specific variables in a given context allows. Unlike the symbolic interactionist framework, the many theories derived from symbolic interactionism, such as [[role theory]] and the versions of identity theory developed by [[Sheldon Stryker]],&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stryker|first=Sheldon|date=1968|title=Identity Salience and Role Performance: The Relevance of Symbolic Interaction Theory for Family Research|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/349494|journal=Journal of Marriage and Family|volume=30|issue=4|pages=558–564|doi=10.2307/349494}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stryker|first=Sheldon|date=January 1994|title=Identity Theory: Its Development, Research Base, and Prospects|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/285539542_Identity_Theory_Its_Development_Research_Base_and_Prospects|journal=Studies in Symbolic Interaction|volume=16|pages=9–20|via=ResearchGate}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Peter Burke and colleagues,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Peter J.|date=1980|title=The Self: Measurement Requirements from an Interactionist Perspective|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3033745|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|volume=43|issue=1|pages=18–29|doi=10.2307/3033745}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Burke|first=Peter J.|last2=Reitzes|first2=Donald C.|date=1981|title=The Link Between Identity and Role Performance|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/3033704|journal=Social Psychology Quarterly|volume=44|issue=2|pages=83–92|doi=10.2307/3033704}}&lt;/ref&gt; clearly define concepts and the relationships between them in a given context, thus allowing for the opportunity to develop and test hypotheses. Further, especially among Blumerian processual interactionists, a great number of very useful conceptualizations have been developed and applied in a very wide range of social contexts, types of populations, types of behaviors, and cultures and subcultures.

===Social structure===
Symbolic interactionism is often related and connected with social structure. This concept suggests that symbolic interactionism is a construction of people's social reality.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; It also implies that from a realistic point of view, the interpretations that are being made will not make much difference. When the reality of a situation is defined, the situation becomes a meaningful reality. This includes methodological criticisms, and critical sociological issues. A number of symbolic interactionists have addressed these topics, the best known being Stryker's structural symbolic interactionism&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/5707030|title=Symbolic interactionism : a social structural version|last=Sheldon.|first=Stryker,|date=1980|publisher=Benjamin/Cummings Pub. Co|isbn=0805391541|location=Menlo Park, Calif.|oclc=5707030}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the formulations of interactionism heavily influenced by this approach (sometimes referred to as the "Indiana School" of symbolic interactionism), including the works of key scholars in sociology and psychology using different methods and theories applying a [[Structuralism|structural]] version of interactionism that are represented in a 2003 collection edited by Burke ''et al''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/853269009|title=Advances in Identity Theory and Research|last=Burke|first=Peter J.|date=2003|publisher=Springer US|others=Owens, Timothy J., Serpe, Richard T., Thoits, Peggy A.|year=|isbn=9781441991881|location=Boston, MA|pages=|oclc=853269009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another well-known structural variation of symbolic interactionism that applies quantitative methods is Manford H. Kuhn's formulation which is often referred to in sociological literature as the "Iowa School". "[[Negotiated order]] theory" also applies a structural approach.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Day|first=Robert|last2=Day|first2=JoAnne V.|date=January 1977|title=A Review of the Current State of Negotiated Order Theory: an Appreciation and a Critique|url=https://doi.org/10.1111/j.1533-8525.1977.tb02165.x|journal=The Sociological Quarterly|language=en|volume=18|issue=1|pages=126–142|doi=10.1111/j.1533-8525.1977.tb02165.x|issn=0038-0253|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Language ====
Language is viewed as the source of all meaning.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Blumer illuminates several key features about social interactionism. Most people interpret things based on assignment and purpose. The interaction occurs once the meaning of something has become identified. This concept of meaning is what starts to construct the framework of social reality. By aligning social reality, Blumer suggests that language is the meaning of interaction. Communication, especially in the form of symbolic interactionism is connected with language. Language initiates all forms of communication, verbal and non-verbal. Blumer defines this source of meaning as a connection that arises out of the social interaction that people have with each other.

==== Critical perspective ====
According to [[social theorist]] Patricia Burbank, the concepts of synergistic and diverging properties are what shape the viewpoints of humans as social beings. These two concepts are different in a sense because of their views of human freedom and their level of focus. According to Burbank, actions are based on the effects of situations that occur during the process of social interaction. Another important factor in meaningful situations is the environment in which the social interaction occurs. The environment influences interaction, which leads to a reference group and connects with perspective, and then concludes to a definition of the situation. This illustrates the proper steps to define a situation. An approval of the action occurs once the situation is defined. An interpretation is then made upon that action, which may ultimately influence the perspective, action, and definition.

Stryker emphasizes that the sociology world at large is the most viable and vibrant intellectual framework.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; By being made up of our thoughts and self-belief, the social interactionism theory is the purpose of all human interaction, and is what causes society to exist. This fuels criticisms of the symbolic interactionist framework for failing to account for social structure, as well as criticisms that interactionist theories cannot be assessed via [[Quantitative Methods|quantitative methods]], and cannot be [[Falsifiability|falsifiable]] or tested [[Empiricism|empirically]]. Framework is important for the symbolic interaction theory because for in order for the social structure to form, there are certain bonds of communication that need to be established to create the interaction. Much of the symbolic interactionist framework's basic tenets can be found in a very wide range of sociological and psychological work, without being explicitly cited as interactionist, making the influence of symbolic interactionism difficult to recognize given this general acceptance of its assumptions as "common knowledge".

The Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction (SSSI)&lt;ref name=SSSI/&gt; is an international professional organization for scholars, who are interested in the study of symbolic interaction. SSSI holds a conference in conjunction with the meeting of the [[American Sociological Association]] and [[the Society for the Study of Social Problems]]. This conference typically occurs in August and sponsors the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction holds the Couch-Stone Symposium each spring. The society provides travel scholarships for student members interested in attending the annual conference.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espach.salford.ac.uk/sssi/index.php|title=Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070607213739/http://www.espach.salford.ac.uk/sssi/index.php|archivedate=June 7, 2007|deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the annual conference, the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction sponsors yearly awards in different categories of symbolic interaction. Additionally, some of the awards are open to student members of the society. The Ellis-Bochner Autoethnography and Personal Narrative Research Award is given annually by the Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction affiliate of the National Communication Association for the best article, essay, or book chapter in autoethnography and personal narrative research. The award is named after renowned autoethnographers [[Carolyn Ellis]] and [[Art Bochner]]. The society also sponsors a quarterly journal, ''[[Symbolic Interaction (journal)|Symbolic Interaction]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://researcher.royalroads.ca/moodle/course/view.php?id=878|title=Royal Roads University Research Portal|last=|first=|date=|website=|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070625140648/http://researcher.royalroads.ca/moodle/course/view.php?id=878|archive-date=22 June 2007|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The organization also releases a newsletter, ''SSSI Notes''.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction has also the European branch.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eusssi2017.uni.lodz.pl/index.php/eu-sssi/|title=The European Society for the Study of Symbolic Interaction (EU SSSI)|last=|first=|date=|website=www.eusssi2017.uni.lodz.pl|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; It organizes each year the conference that integrates European symbolic interactionists.

 |In contemporary accounts it is also referred to as a '''robot bomb'''.{{sfn|Vanek|1999|p=81}}{{sfn|Lloyd|Hall|1997|p=222}}
 }} and in Germany as '''''Kirschkern''''' (cherrystone) or '''''Maikäfer''''' (maybug)&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, John.  ''The Race for Hitler's X-Planes'' (The Mill, Gloucestershire:  History Press, 2013), p.108.&lt;/ref&gt;—was an early [[cruise missile]] and the only production aircraft to use a [[pulsejet]] for power.

The V-1 was the first of the so-called "Vengeance weapons" ([[V-weapons]] or ''Vergeltungswaffen'') series designed for [[terror bombing]] of London. It was developed at [[Peenemünde Army Research Center]] in 1939 by the [[Nazi Germany|Nazi German]] ''[[Luftwaffe]]'' during the [[Second World War]]. During initial development it was known by the [[codename]] "Cherry Stone". Because of its limited range, the thousands of V-1 missiles launched into England were fired from launch facilities along the French ([[Pas-de-Calais]]) and Dutch coasts. The first V-1 was launched at London on 13 June 1944,&lt;ref&gt;[http://myunclefred.blogspot.co.uk/ War &amp; peace and the price of cat-fish] (Contemporary diary.)&lt;/ref&gt; one week after (and prompted by) the successful [[Operation Overlord|Allied landings in Europe]]. At peak, more than one hundred V-1s a day were fired at south-east England, 9,521 in total, decreasing in number as sites were overrun until October 1944, when the last V-1 site in range of Britain was overrun by [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] forces. After this, the  V-1s were directed at the port of [[Antwerp]] and other targets in Belgium, with 2,448 V-1s being launched. The attacks stopped only a month before the war in Europe ended, when the last launch site in the [[Low Countries]] was overrun on 29 March 1945.

The British operated an arrangement of [[air defence]]s, including [[anti-aircraft gun]]s and fighter aircraft, to intercept the bombs before they reached their targets as part of [[Operation Crossbow]], while the launch sites and underground [[List of V-1 storage depots|V-1 storage depots]] were targets of [[strategic bombing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite video|year=1944|title=''"American Sub Rescues Airmen"''|url=https://archive.org/details/gov.archives.arc.39150|publisher=[[Universal Newsreel]]|accessdate=21 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design and development==
In late 1936, while employed by the ''[[Argus Motoren]]'' company, [[Fritz Gosslau]] began work on the further development of remote-controlled aircraft; Argus had already developed a remote-controlled surveillance aircraft, the [[Argus As 292|AS 292]] (military designation FZG 43).

On 9 November 1939, a proposal for a remote-controlled aircraft carrying a payload of {{convert|1000|kg|lb|abbr=on}} over a distance of {{convert |500|km|mi|abbr=on}} was forwarded to the [[Ministry of Aviation (Germany)|RLM]] (German Air Ministry). Argus worked in cooperation with Lorentz AG and [[Arado Flugzeugwerke]] to develop the project as a private venture, and in April 1940, Gosslau presented an improved study of Project "''Fernfeuer''" to the RLM, as Project P 35 "''Erfurt''".

On 31 May, [[Rudolf Bree]] of the RLM commented that he saw no chance that the projectile could be deployed in combat conditions, as the proposed remote-control system was seen as a design weakness. Heinrich Koppenberg, the director of Argus, met with [[Ernst Udet]] on 6 January 1941 to try to convince him that the development should be continued, but Udet decided to cancel it.

Despite this, Gosslau was convinced that the basic idea was sound and proceeded to simplify the design. As an [[aircraft engine]] manufacturer, Argus lacked the capability to produce a fuselage for the project and Koppenberg sought the assistance of [[Robert Lusser]], chief designer and technical director at [[Heinkel]]. On 22 January 1942, Lusser took up a position with the Fieseler aircraft company. He met Koppenberg on 27 February and was informed of Gosslau's project. Gosslau's design used two [[pulsejet]] engines; Lusser improved the design to use a single engine.

A final proposal for the project was submitted to the Technical Office of the RLM on 5 June and the project was renamed Fi 103, as [[Fieseler]] was to be the chief contractor. On 19 June, ''[[Generalfeldmarschall]]'' [[Erhard Milch]] gave Fi 103 production high priority, and development was undertaken at the Luftwaffe's ''Erprobungsstelle'' coastal test centre at [[Karlshagen]], part of the [[Peenemünde-West]] facility.

By 30 August, Fieseler had completed the first fuselage, and the first flight of the Fi 103 V7 took place on 10 December 1942, when it was airdropped by a [[Focke-Wulf Fw 200|Fw 200]].{{sfn|Reuter|2000|pp=56–59}}

The V-1 was named by ''The Reich'' journalist Hans Schwarz Van Berkl in June 1944 with Hitler's approval.&lt;ref name="Evans2008"&gt;{{citation|author=Richard J. Evans|title=The Third Reich at War, 1939–1945|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0XZHSyTLyIMC&amp;pg=PA660|year=2008|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-1-59420-206-3|pages=660–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[File:V-1 cutaway.jpg|thumb|250px|V-1 cutaway]]
The V-1 was designed under the codename ''Kirschkern'' (cherry stone){{sfn|Zaloga|2005|p=6}} by Lusser and Gosslau, with a [[fuselage]] constructed mainly of welded [[sheet steel]] and wings built of [[plywood]]. The simple, Argus-built pulsejet engine pulsed 50 times per second,{{sfn|Werrell|1985|p=53}} and the characteristic buzzing sound gave rise to the colloquial names "buzz bomb" or "doodlebug" (a common name for a wide variety of flying insects). It was known briefly in Germany (on Hitler's orders) as ''Maikäfer'' ([[Phyllophaga (genus)|May bug]]) and ''Krähe'' (crow).{{sfn|Zaloga|2005|pp=8–9}}

===Power plant===
{{main|Argus As 014}}
Ignition of the Argus pulsejet was accomplished using an automotive type [[spark plug]] located about {{convert|76|cm|ft|abbr=on}} behind the intake shutters, with current supplied from a portable starting unit. Three air nozzles in the front of the pulsejet were at the same time connected to an external high-pressure air source that was used to start the engine. [[Acetylene]] gas was typically used for starting the engine, and very often a panel of wood or similar material was held across the end of the tailpipe to prevent the fuel from diffusing and escaping before ignition. The V-1 was fuelled by {{convert|625|L|USgal|abbr=off}} of 75 [[octane]] gasoline.

Once the engine had been started and the temperature had risen to the minimum operating level, the external air hose and connectors were removed and the engine's [[resonant]] design kept it firing without any further need for the electrical ignition system, which was used only to ignite the engine when starting.
[[File:V1 Launcher IWM Duxford.JPG|thumb|left|225px|Rear view of V-1 in [[IWM Duxford]] showing launch ramp section]]

The Argus As 014 (also known as a resonant jet) could operate at zero airspeed because of the nature of its intake shutters and its acoustically tuned resonant [[combustion chamber]]. However, because of the low static thrust of the pulse jet engine and the very high [[stall speed]] of the small wings, the V-1 could not take off under its own power in a practically short distance, and thus needed to be ground-launched by [[aircraft catapult]] or air-launched from a modified [[bomber]] aircraft such as a [[Heinkel He 111]].

Beginning in January 1941, the V-1's pulsejet engine was also tested on a variety of craft, including automobiles{{sfn|Zaloga|2005|p=5}} and an experimental [[attack boat]] known as the "Tornado". The unsuccessful prototype was a version of a ''Sprengboot'', in which a boat loaded with explosives was steered towards a target ship and the pilot would leap out of the back at the last moment. The Tornado was assembled from surplus [[seaplane]] hulls connected in [[catamaran]] fashion with a small pilot cabin on the crossbeams. The Tornado prototype was a noisy underperformer and was abandoned in favour of more conventional [[piston engine]]d craft.

The engine made its first flight aboard a [[Gotha Go 145]] on 30 April 1941.{{sfn|Zaloga|2005|p = 5}}

===Guidance system===
[[File:V1Musee.jpg|thumb|225px|A V-1 on display in ''[[Musée de l'Armée]]'']]
[[File:Launcher of V-1 rocket in Historisch-technisches Informationszentrum Peenemünde (1).JPG|thumb|A reconstructed starting ramp for V-1 flying bombs, [[Historical Technical Museum, Peenemünde]] (2009)]]
The V-1 [[missile guidance|guidance system]] used a simple [[autopilot]] developed by [[:de:Askania Werke#Astronomische und geod.C3.A4tische Instrumente|Askania]] in Berlin to regulate altitude and airspeed.{{sfn|Zaloga|2005|p = 6}} The RLM at first planned to use a [[radio control]] system with the V-1 for [[precision-guided munition|precision attacks]], but the government decided instead to use the missile against London.{{r|levine1992}} A weighted pendulum system provided fore-and-aft attitude measurement to control [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)|pitch]], damped by a [[gyrocompass]] which also stabilized it. Operating power for the [[gyroscope]] platform and the flight-control actuators was provided by two large spherical [[compressed air tank]]s that also [[pressurized]] the fuel tank. These air tanks were charged to {{convert|150|atm|psi|-1|abbr=on}} before launch. With the counter determining how far the missile would fly, it was only necessary to launch the V-1 with the ramp pointing in the approximate direction, and the autopilot controlled the flight.

There was a more sophisticated interaction between [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)|yaw]], [[Flight dynamics (aircraft)|roll]] and other sensors: a gyrocompass (set by swinging in a hangar before launch) gave feedback to control the dynamics of pitch and roll, but it was angled away from the horizontal so that controlling these [[degrees of freedom (engineering)|degrees of freedom]] interacted: the gyroscope remained true on the basis of feedback received from a magnetic compass,{{citation needed|date=February 2008}} and from the fore and aft pendulum. This interaction meant that [[rudder]] control was sufficient for steering and no banking mechanism was needed. In a V-1 that landed without detonating between [[Tilburg]] and [[Goirle]] in March 1945, several rolled up issues of the German wartime propaganda magazine ''[[Signal (magazine)|Signal]]'' were found inserted into the left wing's [[Cylinder (geometry)|tubular]] steel spar, used for weight to preset the missile's [[static equilibrium]] before launching. Several of the earliest V-1s to be launched were provided with a small radio [[transmitter]] (using a [[Vacuum tube#Triodes|triode valve]] marked 'S3' but equivalent to a then-current power valve, type RL 2,4T1) to check the general direction of flight related to the launching place's and the target's grid coordinates by radio [[bearing (navigation)]].

An odometer driven by a [[vane anemometer]] on the nose determined when the target area had been reached, accurately enough for [[area bombing]]. Before launch, the counter was set to a value that would reach zero upon arrival at the target in the prevailing wind conditions. As the missile flew, the airflow turned the propeller, and every 30 rotations of the propeller counted down one number on the counter. This counter triggered the arming of the warhead after about {{convert|60|km|mi|abbr=on}}.{{sfn|Werrell|1985|p=54}} When the count reached zero, two [[Pyrotechnic fastener|detonating bolts]] were fired. Two [[Spoiler (aeronautics)|spoilers]] on the [[Elevator (aircraft)|elevator]] were released, the linkage between the elevator and servo was jammed and a [[guillotine]] device cut off the control hoses to the rudder servo, setting the rudder in neutral. These actions put the V-1 into a steep dive.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=FZG 76 Geräte-Handbuch|chapter=Teil 1|pages=7–8|date= April 1944|language=German}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|url=http://www.psywarrior.com/V1RocketLeaf.html|title=German V-1 Leaflet Campaign|publisher=Psy Warrior|accessdate=20 October 2010}}.&lt;/ref&gt; While this was originally intended to be a power dive, in practice the dive caused the fuel flow to cease, which stopped the engine. The sudden silence after the buzzing alerted listeners of the impending impact. The fuel problem was quickly fixed, and when the last V-1s fell, the majority hit with power.

Initially, V-1s landed within a circle {{convert|19|mi|abbr=off}} in diameter, but by the end of the war, accuracy had been improved to about 7 miles, which was comparable to the [[V-2 rocket]].&lt;ref&gt;Kloeppel, Major Kirk M., The Military Utility of German Rocketry During World War II, Air Command and Staff College, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Warhead ===
The warhead was 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg of [[Amatol|Amatol-39]], later the [[aluminised explosive]] [[Trialen]] was used, as used for filling other Luftwaffe 1,000&amp;nbsp;kg bombs. Trialen fillings were identified by the warhead being painted red, although the assembled missiles were painted green or grey over this.

Fuzing was by a triple fuze system. The main fuzes were an electrical [[impact fuze]] and a mechanical backup impact fuze. These were immediate action fuzes, the intention being to detonate the warhead on the first impact with the surface, rather than allowing itself to become buried first. This was a major difference from the V-2, and a reason for the high lethality of the V-1. Although they did not demolish buildings or deep structures as effectively as the air-dropped bombs, or the deep-burying V-2, their blast effects were almost all released at the surface and caused many casualties. The electrical fuze, ZLPM 76, was mounted at the front, immediately behind the compass and the air speed propeller. It connected to a central exploder tube through the warhead, containing the [[gaine]] and boosters. Two transverse fuze pockets, in typical German fashion, were placed in the upper surface of the warhead for the secondary fuzes, also connecting to this same tube.

To avoid the risk of this secret weapon being examined by the British, there was a third time delay fuze. This was too short to be any sort of booby trap, just to destroy the weapon if a soft landing had not triggered the impact fuzes. These fuzing systems were very reliable and there were almost no dud V-1s recovered.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

===Launch ramp===
Ground-launched V-1s were typically propelled up an inclined launch ramp by an apparatus known as a ''Dampferzeuger'' ("steam generator"), which reacted stabilized [[hydrogen peroxide]] and [[potassium permanganate]] (''[[T-Stoff]]'' and ''[[Z-Stoff]]''),{{sfn|Werrell|1985}} the same combination of chemicals used as propellants for the [[Messerschmitt Me 163 Komet]] rocket plane, and the [[Walter HWK 109-500]] ''Starthilfe'' [[RATO]] rocket booster unit. Ramp-launch velocity for an operational V-1 was {{convert|580|km/h|mph|abbr=on}} as it left the end of the launch ramp.

The original design for launch sites included a number of hangars or storage garages as well as preparation and command buildings, as well as the launch ramp, all of which were easily identifiable from aerial photographs resulting in bombing attacks on the sites. Launching needed a steam generator.

100 litres of Hydrogen Peroxide and Potassium Permanganate was later used in place of steam, whereby the V-1 was thrown into the air using a system similar to that used on an aircraft carrier to launch planes.

A light design utilising a small (7.5m) preparation building, a small firing control room and the 36m launch ramp which was supplied in kit form, with legs resting in concrete recesses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.atlantikwall.org.uk/v1_light_stes.htm |title=V1 Light Sites |publisher=Atlantic Wall |accessdate=9 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Operation and effectiveness==
[[File:Mile end grove road 2.jpg|thumb| On 13 June 1944, the first V-1 struck London next to the railway bridge on [[A1205 road#Grove Road|Grove Road]], [[Mile End]], which now carries this [[English Heritage]] [[blue plaque]]. Eight civilians were killed in the blast.]]

The first complete V-1 airframe was delivered on 30 August 1942,{{sfn|Zaloga|2005|p=6}} and after the first complete [[Argus As 014|As.109-014]] was delivered in September,{{sfn|Zaloga|2005|p=6}} the first glide test flight was on 28 October 1942 at [[Peenemünde]], from under a Focke-Wulf Fw 200.{{sfn|Zaloga|2005|p=5}} The first powered trial was on 10 December, launched from beneath an He 111.{{sfn|Zaloga|2005|p=6}}

The [[LXV Army Corps (Wehrmacht)|LXV Armeekorps z.b.V.]] formed during the last days of November 1943 in France commanded by General der Artillerie z.V. [[Erich Heinemann]] was responsible for the operational use of V-1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.axishistory.com/books/149-germany-heer/heer-korps/2781-lxv-armeekorps-zbv LXV Armeekorps z.b.V.]&lt;/ref&gt;

The conventional launch sites could theoretically launch about 15 V-1s per day, but this rate was difficult to achieve on a consistent basis; the maximum rate achieved was 18. Overall, only about 25 per cent of the V-1s hit their targets, the majority being lost because of a combination of defensive measures, mechanical unreliability or guidance errors. With the capture or destruction of the launch facilities used to attack England, the V-1s were employed in attacks against strategic points in Belgium, primarily the port of [[Antwerp]].

Launches against Britain were met by a variety of countermeasures, including [[barrage balloons]] and aircraft including the [[Hawker Tempest]] and [[Gloster Meteor]]. These measures were so successful that by August 1944 about 80 per cent of V-1s were being destroyed&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, pp.108–9.&lt;/ref&gt; (the Meteors, although fast enough to catch the V-1s, suffered frequent cannon failures, and accounted for only 13).&lt;ref name="Christopher, p.109"&gt;Christopher, p.109.&lt;/ref&gt; In all, about 1,000 V-1s were destroyed by aircraft.&lt;ref name="Christopher, p.109"/&gt;

The intended operational altitude was originally set at {{convert|2750|m|ft|-2|abbr=on}}. However, repeated failures of a barometric fuel-pressure regulator led to it being changed in May 1944, halving the operational height, thereby bringing V-1s into range of the [[Bofors 40 mm|Bofors guns]] commonly used by Allied [[Anti-aircraft|AA]] units.{{sfn|Zaloga|2005|p=11}}

[[File:Fieseler Fi103 debajo de un Heinkel 111.jpg|thumb|left|A German ''Luftwaffe'' Heinkel He 111 H-22. This version could carry FZG 76 (V1) flying bombs, but only a few aircraft were produced in 1944. Some were used by bomb wing KG 3.]]
The trial versions of the V-1 were air-launched. Most operational V-1s were launched from static sites on land, but from July 1944 to January 1945, the ''Luftwaffe'' launched approximately 1,176 from modified [[Heinkel He 111]] H-22s of the ''Luftwaffe''{{'}}s [[Kampfgeschwader 3]] (3rd Bomber Wing, the so-called "Blitz Wing") flying over the [[North Sea]]. Apart from the obvious motive of permitting the bombardment campaign to continue after static ground sites on the French coast were lost, air-launching gave the ''Luftwaffe'' the opportunity to outflank the increasingly effective ground and air defences put up by the British against the missile. To minimise the associated risks (primarily radar detection), the aircrews developed a tactic called "lo-hi-lo": the He 111s would, upon leaving their airbases and crossing the coast, descend to an exceptionally low altitude. When the launch point was neared, the bombers would swiftly ascend, fire their V-1s, and then rapidly descend again to the previous "wave-top" level for the return flight. Research after the war estimated a 40 per cent failure rate of air-launched V-1s, and the He 111s used in this role were vulnerable to night-fighter attack, as the launch lit up the area around the aircraft for several seconds. The combat potential of air-launched V-1s dwindled as 1944 progressed at about the same rate as that of the ground-launched missiles, as the British gradually took the measure of the weapon and developed increasingly effective defence tactics.

==Experimental and long-range variants==
[[File:Arado Ar 234 Blitz mit V1 pic1.JPG|thumb|250px|Model of an [[Arado Ar 234]] carrying a V-1 at the [[Technikmuseum Speyer]]]]
[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1973-029A-24A, Marschflugkörper V1 vor Start.jpg|thumb|250px|A German crew rolls out a V-1.]]
[[File:V-1 (Fieseler Fi 103) in flight.jpg|thumb|V-1 (Fieseler Fi 103) in flight]]
Late in the war, several air-launched piloted V-1s, known as ''[[Fieseler Fi 103R (Reichenberg)|Reichenbergs]]'', were built, but these were never used in combat. [[Hanna Reitsch]] made some flights in the modified V-1 Fieseler ''Reichenberg'' when she was asked to find out why test pilots were unable to land it and had died as a result. She discovered, after simulated landing attempts at high altitude where there was air space to recover, that the craft had an extremely high [[stall speed]] and the previous pilots with little high-speed experience had attempted their approaches much too slowly. Her recommendation of much higher landing speeds was then introduced in training new ''Reichenberg'' volunteer pilots. The ''Reichenberg''s were air-launched rather than fired from a catapult ramp as erroneously portrayed in the film ''[[Operation Crossbow (film)|Operation Crossbow]]''.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

There were plans, not put into practice, to use the [[Arado Ar 234]] jet bomber to launch V-1s either by towing them aloft or by launching them from a "piggy back" position (in the manner of the ''[[Mistel]]'', but in reverse) atop the aircraft. In the latter configuration, a pilot-controlled, hydraulically operated dorsal trapeze mechanism would elevate the missile on the trapeze's launch cradle some eight feet clear of the 234's upper fuselage. This was necessary to avoid damaging the mother craft's fuselage and tail surfaces when the pulsejet ignited, as well as to ensure a "clean" airflow for the Argus motor's intake. A somewhat less ambitious project undertaken was the adaptation of the missile as a "flying fuel tank" ''(Deichselschlepp)'' for the [[Messerschmitt Me 262]] jet fighter, which was initially test-towed behind an [[Heinkel He 177|He 177A ''Greif'']] bomber. The pulsejet, internal systems and warhead of the missile were removed, leaving only the wings and basic fuselage, now containing a single large fuel tank. A small cylindrical module, similar in shape to a finless dart, was placed atop the vertical stabilizer at the rear of the tank, acting as a centre of gravity balance and attachment point for a variety of equipment sets. A rigid tow-bar with a pitch pivot at the forward end connected the flying tank to the Me 262. The operational procedure for this unusual configuration saw the tank resting on a wheeled trolley for take-off. The trolley was dropped once the combination was airborne, and explosive bolts separated the towbar from the fighter upon exhaustion of the tank's fuel supply. A number of test flights were conducted in 1944 with this set-up, but inflight "porpoising" of the tank, with the instability transferred to the fighter, meant the system was too unreliable to be used. An identical utilisation of the V-1 flying tank for the Ar 234 bomber was also investigated, with the same conclusions reached. Some of the "flying fuel tanks" used in trials utilised a cumbersome fixed and spatted undercarriage arrangement, which (along with being pointless) merely increased the drag and stability problems already inherent in the design.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

One variant of the basic Fi 103 design did see operational use. The progressive loss of French launch sites as 1944 proceeded and the area of territory under German control shrank meant that soon the V-1 would lack the range to hit targets in England. Air-launching was one alternative utilised, but the most obvious solution was to extend the missile's range. Thus the F-1 version developed. The weapon's fuel tank was increased in size, with a corresponding reduction in the capacity of the warhead. Additionally, the nose-cones and wings of the F-1 models were made of wood, affording a considerable weight saving. With these modifications, the V-1 could be fired at London and nearby urban centres from prospective ground sites in the Netherlands. Frantic efforts were made to construct a sufficient number of F-1s in order to allow a large-scale bombardment campaign to coincide with the [[Ardennes Offensive]], but numerous factors (bombing of the factories producing the missiles, shortages of steel and rail transport, the chaotic tactical situation Germany was facing at this point in the war, etc.) delayed the delivery of these long-range V-1s until February/March 1945. Beginning on 2 March 1945, slightly more than three weeks before the V-1 campaign finally ended, several hundred F-1s were launched at Britain from Dutch sites under Operation "Zeppelin".  Frustrated by increasing Allied dominance in the air, Germany also employed V1s to attack the RAF's forward airfields, such as Volkel, in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The RAF Regiment at War 1942–1946|last=Oliver|first=Kingsley|publisher=Pen &amp; Sword|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There was also a [[turbojet]]-propelled upgraded variant proposed,&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, John.  ''The Race for Hitler's X-Planes'' (The Mill, Gloucestershire:  History Press, 2013), p.179.&lt;/ref&gt; meant to use the [[Porsche 109-005]] low-cost turbojet engine&lt;ref&gt;[http://4.bp.blogspot.com/-IeOYPiW1wHM/VFNzWZ6dE2I/AAAAAAAAOAE/Fo67HeC4cOU/s1600/por12.png Porsche 109-005 engine drawing]&lt;/ref&gt; of some 500 kgf (1,100&amp;nbsp;lbf) thrust.

Almost 30,000 V-1s were made; by March 1944, they were each produced in 350 hours (including 120 for the autopilot), at a cost of just 4 per cent of a [[V-2 rocket|V-2]],{{sfn|Zaloga|2005|p=11}} which delivered a comparable payload. Approximately 10,000 were fired at England; 2,419 reached London, killing about 6,184 people and injuring 17,981.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = Tiscali | location = UK | title = Home front | url = http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/homefront/arp/arp4a.html | contribution = Air Raid Precautions – Deaths and injuries}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The greatest density of hits were received by [[Croydon]], on the south-east fringe of London. [[Antwerp]], Belgium was hit by 2,448 V-1s from October 1944 to March 1945.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.verzet.org/content/view/419/29/1/6/ | title = V-bommenterreur boven Antwerpen | language = German | publisher = Verzet | accessdate = 20 October 2010 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20100210045539/http://www.verzet.org/content/view/419/29/1/6/ | archivedate = 10 February 2010 | df = dmy-all }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.v2rocket.com/start/chapters/ant_map_large.jpg | title = Impact points of V-1 and V-2 around Antwerp | publisher = V2 Rocket | accessdate = 20 October 2010 | type = map | format = [[JPEG]]}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Intelligence reports==
{{For|Allied intelligence activities and German counterintelligence regarding the flying bomb|V-1 and V-2 Intelligence}}
The codename "''Flakzielgerät'' 76"—"[[Flak]] target apparatus" helped to hide the nature of the device, and some time passed before references to FZG 76 were linked to the V-83 pilotless aircraft (an experimental V-1) that had crashed on [[Bornholm]] in the Baltic and to reports from agents of a flying bomb capable of being used against London. Importantly, the Polish [[Home Army]] intelligence [[Home Army and V-1 and V-2|contributed information]] on V-1 construction and a place of development (Peenemünde). Initially, British experts were sceptical of the V-1 because they had considered only solid fuel rockets, which could not attain the stated range of {{convert|1000|kg|lb|abbr=on}}: {{convert|130|mi|abbr=off}}. However, they later considered other types of engine, and by the time German scientists had achieved the needed accuracy to deploy the V-1 as a weapon, British intelligence had a very accurate assessment of it.&lt;ref&gt;[[Reginald Victor Jones|Jones, R. V.]] (1978). ''Most Secret War: British Scientific Intelligence 1939–1945''. London: Hamish Hamilton. {{ISBN|0-241-89746-7}}. pp. 523-42.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countermeasures in England==
===Anti-aircraft guns===
[[File:The British Army in the United Kingdom 1939-45 H39728.jpg|thumb|right|A battery of static QF 3.7-inch guns on railway-sleeper platforms at [[Hastings]] on the south coast of England, July 1944]]
The British defence against the German long-range weapons was [[Operation Crossbow]]. [[Anti-aircraft]] guns of the Royal Artillery and [[RAF Regiment]] redeployed in several movements: first in mid-June 1944 from positions on the [[North Downs]] to the south coast of England, then a cordon closing the [[Thames Estuary]] to attacks from the east. In September 1944, a new linear defence line was formed on the coast of [[East Anglia]], and finally in December there was a further layout along the [[Lincolnshire]]–[[Yorkshire]] coast. The deployments were prompted by changes to the approach tracks of the V-1 as launch sites were overrun by the Allies' advance.

On the first night of sustained bombardment, the anti-aircraft crews around Croydon were jubilant – suddenly they were downing unprecedented numbers of German bombers; most of their targets burst into flames and fell when their engines cut out. There was great disappointment when the truth was announced. Anti-aircraft gunners soon found that such small fast-moving targets were, in fact, very difficult to hit. The cruising altitude of the V-1, between {{convert|600|to|900|m|ft|abbr=on}}, was just above the effective range of light anti-aircraft guns, and just below the optimum engagement height of heavier guns.

The altitude and speed were more than the rate of traverse of the standard British [[QF 3.75 inch AA|QF 3.7-inch]] mobile gun could cope with. The static version of the QF 3.7-inch, designed for use on a permanent, concrete platform, had a faster traverse. The cost and delay of installing new permanent platforms for the guns was fortunately found to be unnecessary - a temporary platform built devised by the REME and made from [[Railroad tie|railway sleepers]] and rails was found to be adequate for the static guns, making them considerably easier to re-deploy as the V-1 threat changed.&lt;ref name="Dobinson2001"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dobinson|first=Colin|title=AA Command: Britain's Anti-aircraft Defences of World War II|year=2001|publisher=Methuen|isbn=978-0-413-76540-6|page=436}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|This was known as a ''Pyle platform'', after the head of Anti-Aircraft Command, General [[Frederick Alfred Pile]]}}

The development of the [[proximity fuze]] and of [[History of radar#Centimetric Radar|centimetric]], 3&amp;nbsp;[[gigahertz]] frequency [[fire control radar|gun-laying radars]] based on the [[cavity magnetron]] helped to counter the V-1's high speed and small size. In 1944, [[Bell Labs]] started delivery of an anti-aircraft [[Kerrison Predictor|predictor]] [[fire-control system]] based on an [[analogue computer]], just in time for the [[Operation Overlord|Allied invasion of Europe]].

These electronic aids arrived in quantity from June 1944, just as the guns reached their firing positions on the coast. Seventeen per cent of all flying bombs entering the coastal "gun belt" were destroyed by guns in their first week on the coast. This rose to 60 per cent by 23 August and 74 per cent in the last week of the month, when on one day 82 per cent were shot down. The rate improved from one V-1 destroyed for every 2,500 shells fired initially, to one for every 100. This still did not end the threat, and V-1 attacks continued until all launch sites were captured by ground forces.

===Barrage balloons===
Eventually some 2,000 [[barrage balloon]]s were deployed, in the hope that V-1s would be destroyed when they struck the balloons' tethering cables. The leading edges of the V-1's wings were fitted with cable cutters, and fewer than 300 V-1s are known to have been brought down by barrage balloons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj89/hillson.html |title="Barrage Balloons for Low-Level Air Defense." |accessdate=2007-04-16 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070202050407/http://www.airpower.maxwell.af.mil/airchronicles/apj/apj89/hillson.html |archivedate=2 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }} ''Air &amp; Space Power Journal'', Summer 1989. Retrieved 20 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Interceptors===
The Defence Committee expressed some doubt as to the ability of the [[Royal Observer Corps]] to adequately deal with the new threat, but the ROC's Commandant [[Finlay Crerar|Air Commodore Finlay Crerar]] assured the committee that the ROC could again rise to the occasion and prove its alertness and flexibility. He oversaw plans for handling the new threat, codenamed by the RAF and ROC as "Operation Totter".

Observers at the coast post of [[Dymchurch]] identified the very first of these weapons and within seconds of their report the anti-aircraft defences were in action. This new weapon gave the ROC much additional work both at posts and operations rooms. Eventually RAF controllers actually took their radio equipment to the two closest ROC operations rooms at Horsham and Maidstone, and vectored fighters direct from the ROC's plotting tables. The critics who had said that the Corps would be unable to handle the fast-flying jet aircraft were answered when these aircraft on their first operation were actually controlled entirely by using ROC information both on the coast and at inland.

The average speed of V-1s was {{convert|550|km/h|abbr=on}} and their average altitude was {{convert|1000|m|abbr=on}} to {{convert |1200|m|abbr=on}}. Fighter aircraft required excellent low altitude performance to intercept them and enough firepower to ensure that they were destroyed in the air rather than crashing to earth and detonating. Most aircraft were too slow to catch a V-1 unless they had a height advantage, allowing them to gain speed by diving on their target.

When V-1 attacks began in mid-June 1944, the only aircraft with the low-altitude speed to be effective against it was the [[Hawker Tempest]]. Fewer than 30 Tempests were available. They were assigned to [[No. 150 Wing RAF]]. Early attempts to intercept and destroy V-1s often failed, but improved techniques soon emerged. These included using the airflow over an interceptor's wing to raise one wing of the V-1, by sliding the wingtip to within {{convert|6|in|cm|abbr=on}} of the lower surface of the V-1's wing. If properly executed, this manoeuvre would tip the V-1's wing up, overriding the [[gyroscope|gyro]] and sending the V-1 into an out-of-control dive. At least sixteen V-1s were destroyed this way (the first by a P-51 piloted by Major R. E. Turner of 356th Fighter Squadron on 18 June).&lt;ref&gt;Thomas, Andrew. ''V1 Flying Bomb Aces''. Botley, Oxford, UK: Osprey Publishing, 2013. {{ISBN|9781780962924}}&lt;/ref&gt; It could be seen that the aerodynamic flip method was actually effective when V-1s could be seen over southern parts of the Netherlands headed due eastwards at low altitude, the engine quenched. In early 1945 such a missile soared below clouds over [[Tilburg]] to gently alight eastwards of the city in open fields.

The Tempest fleet was built up to over 100 aircraft by September. Specially modified [[Republic P-47 Thunderbolt#P-47M|P-47M Thunderbolts]] (half their fuel tanks, half their 0.5in {12.7&amp;nbsp;mm} machine guns, boosted engines (2800&amp;nbsp;hp), all external fittings, and all their armour plate removed) were also pressed into service against the V-1s. In addition, [[North American P-51 Mustang]]s and [[Rolls-Royce Griffon|Griffon]]-engined [[Supermarine Spitfire]] [[Supermarine Spitfire (Griffon powered variants)#Mk XIV (type 379)|Mk XIVs]] were tuned to make them fast enough, and during the short summer nights the Tempests shared defensive duty with [[de Havilland Mosquito]]s. There was no need for airborne radar; at night the V-1's engine could be heard from {{convert|10|mi|km|abbr=on}} away or more, and the exhaust plume was visible from a long distance. [[Wing Commander (rank)|Wing Commander]] [[Roland Beamont]] had the 20&amp;nbsp;mm cannon on his Tempest adjusted to converge at {{convert|300|yd|m|abbr=on}} ahead. This was so successful that all other aircraft in 150 Wing were thus modified.

The anti-V-1 sorties by fighters were known as "Diver patrols" (after "Diver", the codename used by the [[Royal Observer Corps]] for V-1 sightings). Attacking a V-1 was dangerous: machine guns had little effect on the V-1's sheet steel structure, and if a cannon shell detonated the warhead, the explosion could destroy the attacker.
[[File:Spitfire Tipping V-1 Flying Bomb.jpg|thumb|A Spitfire using its wingtip to "topple" a V-1 flying bomb]]

In daylight, V-1 chases were chaotic and often unsuccessful until a special defence zone was declared between London and the coast, in which only the fastest fighters were permitted. The first interception of a V-1 was by F/L J. G. Musgrave with a [[No. 605 Squadron RAF]] Mosquito night fighter on the night of 14/15 June 1944. As daylight grew stronger after the night attack, a Spitfire was seen to follow closely behind a V-1 over Chislehurst and Lewisham. Between June and 5 September 1944, a handful of 150 Wing Tempests shot down 638 flying bombs,&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=h98DAAAAMBAJ&amp;pg=PA54 "4-Cannon Tempest Chases Nazi Robot Bomb."] ''Popular Mechanics'', February 1945.&lt;/ref&gt; with [[No. 3 Squadron RAF]] alone claiming 305. One Tempest pilot, Squadron Leader [[Joseph Berry (RAF officer)]] ([[No. 501 Squadron RAF|501 Squadron]]), shot down 59 V-1s, the Belgian ace Squadron Leader [[Remy Van Lierde]] ([[No. 164 Squadron RAF|164 Squadron]]) destroyed 44 (with a further nine shared) and W/C Roland Beamont (see above) destroyed 31.

The next most successful interceptors were the Mosquito (623 victories),{{sfn|Sharp|Bowyer|1995|p=179}} Spitfire XIV (303),&lt;ref&gt;Squadrons 91, 322 (Dutch) and 610. The top ace was S/L Kynaston of 91 Sqn with 21 destroyed. (''Ultimate Spitfire'' pp. 203–204)&lt;/ref&gt; and Mustang (232). All other types combined added 158. Even though it was not fully operational, the jet-powered [[Gloster Meteor]] was rushed into service with [[No. 616 Squadron RAF]] to fight the V-1s. It had ample speed but its cannons were prone to jamming, and it shot down only 13 V-1s.{{sfn|Cooper|1997|p=8}}&lt;!-- These were the first air battles between jet-powered aircraft in history, although that distinction is usually ascribed to the battles between manned jet fighters during the Korean War in 1950.—not an air "battle", but an interception--&gt;

In late 1944 a radar-equipped [[Vickers Wellington]] bomber was modified for use by the RAF's [[Fighter Interception Unit]] as an [[Airborne Early Warning and Control]] aircraft.{{sfn|Jackson|2007|p=217}} Flying at an altitude of {{convert |4000|ft|m}} over the North Sea, it directed Mosquito fighters charged with intercepting He 111s from Dutch airbases that sought to launch V-1s from the air.

===Disposal===
The first [[bomb disposal]] officer to defuse an unexploded V-1 was [[John Pilkington Hudson]] in 1944.{{sfn|Self|2011}}

===Deception===
To adjust and correct settings in the V-1 guidance system, the Germans needed to know where the V-1s were impacting. Therefore, [[Abwehr|German intelligence]] was requested to obtain this impact data from their agents in Britain. However, [[Double Cross System|all German agents in Britain had been turned]], and were acting as double agents under British control.

[[File:Flying Bomb- V1 Bomb Damage in London, England, UK, 1944 D21237.jpg|thumb|Aftermath of a V-1 bombing, London, 1944]]
On 16 June 1944, British double agent ''Garbo'' ([[Juan Pujol]]) was requested by his German controllers to give information on the sites and times of V-1 impacts, with similar requests made to the other German agents in Britain, ''Brutus'' ([[Roman Czerniawski]]) and ''Tate'' ([[Wulf Schmidt]]). If given this data, the Germans would be able to adjust their aim and correct any shortfall. However, there was no plausible reason why the double agents could not supply accurate data; the impacts would be common knowledge amongst Londoners and very likely reported in the press, which the Germans had ready access to through the neutral nations. In addition, as [[John Cecil Masterman]], chairman of the [[Double Cross System|Twenty Committee]], commented, "If, for example, St Paul's Cathedral were hit, it was useless and harmful to report that the bomb had descended upon a cinema in [[Islington]], since the truth would inevitably get through to Germany ..."{{sfn|Masterman|1972|pp=252–53}}

While the British decided how to react, Pujol played for time. On 18 June it was decided that the double agents would report the damage caused by V-1s fairly accurately and minimise the effect they had on civilian morale. It was also decided that Pujol should avoid giving the times of impacts, and should mostly report on those which occurred in the north west of London, to give the impression to the Germans that they were overshooting the target area.{{sfn|Crowdy|2008|pp=273–74}}

While Pujol downplayed the extent of V-1 damage, trouble came from ''Ostro'', an ''[[Abwehr]]'' agent in [[Lisbon]] who pretended to have agents reporting from London. He told the Germans that London had been devastated and had been mostly evacuated as a result of enormous casualties. The Germans could not perform aerial reconnaissance of London, and believed his damage reports in preference to Pujol's. They thought that the Allies would make every effort to destroy the V-1 launch sites in France. They also accepted ''Ostro''{{'}}s impact reports. Due to [[Ultra]], however, the Allies read his messages and adjusted for them.{{sfn|Masterman|1972|p=254}}

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 146-1981-004-19, Max Wachtel.jpg|thumb|Max Wachtel]]
A certain number of the V-1s fired had been fitted with radio transmitters, which had clearly demonstrated a tendency for the V-1 to fall short. ''[[Oberst]]'' Max Wachtel, commander of Flak Regiment 155 (W), which was responsible for the V-1 offensive, compared the data gathered by the transmitters with the reports obtained through the double agents. He concluded, when faced with the discrepancy between the two sets of data, that there must be a fault with the radio transmitters, as he had been assured that the agents were completely reliable. It was later calculated that if Wachtel had disregarded the agents' reports and relied on the radio data, he would have made the correct adjustments to the V-1's guidance, and casualties might have increased by 50 per cent or more.{{sfn|Jones|1978|p=422}}{{sfn|Crowdy|2008|p=280}}

The policy of diverting V-1 impacts away from central London was initially controversial. The War Cabinet refused to authorise a measure that would increase casualties in any area, even if it reduced casualties elsewhere by greater amounts. It was thought that [[Winston Churchill|Churchill]] would reverse this decision later (he was then away at a conference); but the delay in starting the reports to Germans might be fatal to the deception. So Sir [[Findlater Stewart]] of [[Home Defence Executive]] took responsibility for starting the deception programme immediately, and his action was approved by Churchill when he returned.{{sfn|Montagu|1978|pp=151–58}}

==End of the V-1 attacks against England==
By September 1944, the V-1 threat to England was temporarily halted when the launch sites on the French coast were overrun by the advancing Allied armies. 4,261 V-1s had been destroyed by fighters, anti-aircraft fire and barrage balloons. The last enemy action of any kind on British soil occurred on 29 March 1945, when a V-1 struck [[Datchworth]] in Hertfordshire.

==Assessment==
Unlike the V-2, the V-1 was a cost-effective weapon for the Germans as it forced the Allies to spend heavily on defensive measures and divert bombers from other targets. More than 25 per cent of [[Combined Bomber Offensive]]'s bombs in July and August 1944 were used against V-weapon sites, often ineffectively.&lt;ref name="levine1992"&gt;{{Citation|title=The Strategic Bombing of Germany, 1940-1945|publisher=Praeger|author=Levine, Alan J.|year=1992|location=Westport, Connecticut|pages=137, 139|isbn=0-275-94319-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; In early December 1944, American General [[Clayton Bissell]] wrote a paper that argued strongly in favour of the V-1 when compared with conventional bombers.{{sfn|Irons|2003|p=199}}

The following is a table he produced:

The statistics of this report, however, have been the subject of some dispute. The V-1 missiles launched from bombers were often prone to exploding prematurely, occasionally resulting in the loss of the aircraft to which they were attached. The Luftwaffe lost 77 aircraft out of 1,200 of these types of sorties.&lt;ref&gt;Hutchinson, Robert (2003) ''Weapons of Mass Destruction'': George Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson, {{ISBN|0297830910}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Wright Field]] technical personnel [[reverse engineering|reverse-engineered]] the V-1 from the remains of one that had failed to detonate in Britain. The result was the creation of the [[Republic-Ford JB-2|JB-2 Loon]].
General [[Hap Arnold]] of the United States Army Air Forces was concerned that this weapon could be built of steel and wood, in 2000 man hours and approximate cost of US$600 (in 1943).&lt;ref name="George Mindling pp6-31"&gt;George Mindling, Robert Bolton: ''US Airforce Tactical Missiles:1949-1969'': The Pioneers'', Lulu.com, 200: {{ISBN|0-557-00029-7}}. pp6-31&lt;/ref&gt; To put this figure in perspective, a [[Boeing B-29 Superfortress]] cost ~1000x more, and still ~100x more when taking into account its 10x higher payload (20,000&amp;nbsp;lb Vs 850&amp;nbsp;kg for V1) -- payload, which cost has to be added (while it is included in V1 cost) --, with the additional drawback of requiring (and putting in danger) 11 flying crew members.

==Belgian attacks==
The attacks on [[Antwerp]] and [[Brussels]] began in October 1944, with the last V-1 launched against Antwerp on 30 March 1945.&lt;ref name=dtic/&gt;{{rp|31}}

Antwerp was recognised by both the German and Allied high command as a very important port, essential to the further progression of Allied armies into Germany.&lt;ref name=dtic/&gt; The shorter range improved the accuracy of the V-1 which was six miles deviation per hundred miles of flight, the flight level was also reduced to around 3,000&amp;nbsp;ft.&lt;ref name="dtic"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.dtic.mil/dtic/tr/fulltext/u2/733387.pdf |title=The defence of Antwerp against the V-1 missile |publisher=Defense Technical Information Center |date=1971}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}

===Countermeasures at Antwerp===
Both British ([[80th Anti-Aircraft Brigade (United Kingdom)|80 AA Brigade]]) and US Army anti-aircraft batteries (30th AAA Group) were sent to Antwerp together with a searchlight regiment. The zone of command under the [[21st Army Group]] was called "Antwerp-X" and given the object of protecting an area with a radius of 7,000 yards covering the city and dock area.&lt;ref name=dtic/&gt;{{rp|34}} Initially attacks came from the south-east, accordingly a screen of observers and searchlights was deployed along the attack azimuth, behind which were three rows of batteries with additional searchlights.&lt;ref name=dtic/&gt;{{rp|36}}

US units deployed [[SCR-584 radar]] units controlling four [[90 mm Gun M1/M2/M3|90mm guns]] per battery using an [[Director (military)|M9 director]] to electrically control the battery guns.&lt;ref name=dtic/&gt;{{rp|40}}  Backup for the American guns was automatic 40mm batteries, which were not effective against V-1s.

British gun batteries were each equipped with eight [[QF 3.7-inch AA gun]] and two radar units, preferably the US SCR-584 with M9 director as it was more accurate than the British system.&lt;ref name=dtic/&gt;{{rp|45}}  Backup for the British guns was also automatic 40mm batteries.

The radar was effective from 28,000 yards, the M9 director predicted the target location position based on course, height and speed which combined with the gun, shell and fuse characteristics predicted an impact position, adjusted each gun and fired the shell.&lt;ref name=dtic/&gt;{{rp|51}}

In November attacks began from the north-east and additional batteries were deployed along the new azimuths, including the [[184th AAA Battalion (United States)]] brought from Paris. Additional radar units and observers were deployed up to 40 miles from Antwerp to give early warning of V-1 bombs approaching.&lt;ref name=dtic/&gt;{{rp|53}} The introduction of the [[Proximity fuze|VT fuse]] in January 1945 improved the effectiveness of the guns and reduced ammunition consumption.&lt;ref name=dtic/&gt;{{rp|68}}

From October 1944 to March 1945 4,883 V-1's were detected. Of these, only 4.5% fell into the designated protected area.&lt;ref name=dtic/&gt;{{rp|54}} The effectiveness of the anti aircraft defence meant that only 211 got through the defences, however those that fell within the area caused damage and loss of life.

==Japanese developments==
In 1943, an Argus pulsejet engine was shipped to Japan by German submarine. The Aeronautical Institute of [[University of Tokyo|Tokyo Imperial University]] and the [[Kawanishi Aircraft Company]] conducted a joint study of the feasibility of mounting a similar engine on a piloted plane. The resulting design was named [[Kawanishi Baika|''Baika'']] ("plum blossom") but bore no more than a superficial resemblance to the Fi 103. ''Baika'' never left the design stage but technical drawings and notes suggest that several versions were considered: an air-launched version with the engine under the fuselage, a ground-launched version that could take off without a ramp and a submarine launched version with the engine moved forwards.

==Post-war==
After the war, the armed forces of France, the [[Soviet Union]] and the United States experimented with the V-1.

===France===
After reverse-engineering captured V-1s in 1946, the French began producing copies for use as [[target drone]]s, starting in 1951. These were called the [[ARSAERO CT 10]] and were smaller than the V-1. The CT 10 could be ground-launched using [[JATO|solid rocket boosters]] or air-launched from a [[LeO 45]] bomber. More than 400 were produced, some of which were exported to the UK, Sweden, and Italy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Winter|first1=Frank|last2=Neufeld|first2=Michael J.|title=Missile, Cruise, V-1 (Fi 103, FZG 76)|url=https://www.si.edu/object/nasm_A19720633000|website=National Air and Space Museum|publisher=[[Smithsonian Institution]]|accessdate=1 May 2018|date=August 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Soviet Union===
The Soviet Union captured V-1s when they overran the [[Blizna]] test range in Poland, as well as from the [[Mittelwerk]].&lt;ref&gt;Christopher, John. ''The Race for Hitler's X-Planes'' (The Mill, Gloucestershire:  History Press, 2013), p.193.&lt;/ref&gt; The 10Kh was their copy of the V-1, later called [[10Kh|Izdeliye 10]].&lt;ref name="Christopher, p.193"&gt;Christopher, p.193.&lt;/ref&gt; Initial tests began in March 1945 at a test range in [[Tashkent]],&lt;ref name="Christopher, p.193"/&gt; with further launches from ground sites and from aircraft of improved versions continuing into the late 1940s. The inaccuracy of the guidance system when compared with new methods such as [[beam-riding]] and [[TV guidance]] saw development end in the early 1950s.

The Soviets also worked on a piloted attack aircraft based on the Argus pulsejet engine of the V-1, which began as a German project, the [[Junkers EF 126]] ''Lilli'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.luft46.com/junkers/juef126.html "Junkers Ju EF126 "Elli"."] luft46.com. Retrieved 20 October 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; in the latter stages of the war. The Soviet development of the ''Lilli'' ended in 1946 after a crash that killed the test pilot.&lt;ref name="Christopher, p.193"/&gt;

===United States===
[[File:USS Cusk;0834807.jpg|thumb|250px|A KGW-1 being fired from {{USS|Cusk|SS-348|6}} in 1951]]
{{main|JB-2 Loon}}
The United States reverse-engineered the V-1 in 1944 from salvaged parts recovered in England during June. By 8 September, the first of thirteen complete prototype Republic-Ford [[JB-2 Loon]]s, was assembled at [[Republic Aviation]]. The United States JB-2 was different from the German V-1 in only the smallest of dimensions. The wing span was only {{convert|2.5|in|cm|abbr=on}} wider and the length was extended less than {{convert|2|ft|m|abbr=on}}. The difference gave the JB-2 {{convert|60.7|sqft|m2}} of wing area versus {{convert |55|sqft|m2}} for the V-1.{{sfn|Mindling|Bolton|2009}}{{Rp|needed=yes|date=February 2012}}

A navalized version, designated KGW-1, was developed to be launched from [[Landing Ship, Tank|LST]]s as well as [[escort carrier]]s (CVEs) and long-range 4-engine reconnaissance aircraft. Waterproof carriers for the KGW-1 were developed for launches of the missile from surfaced submarines. Both the USAAF JB-2 and Navy KGW-1 were put into production and were planned to be used in the Allied invasion of Japan ([[Operation Downfall]]). However, the surrender of Japan obviated the need for its use.{{sfn|Mindling|Bolton|2009}}{{Rp|needed=yes|date=February 2012}} After the end of the war, the JB-2/KGW-1 played a significant role in the development of more advanced surface-to-surface tactical missile systems such as the [[MGM-1 Matador]] and later [[MGM-13 Mace]].

'''''Wild Law: A Manifesto for Earth Justice''''' is a book by [[Cormac Cullinan]] that proposes recognizing natural communities and ecosystems as legal persons with legal rights. The book explains the concept of [[wild law]], that is, human laws that are consistent with [[earth jurisprudence]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Discovering the meaning of Earth jurisprudence|publisher= Legalbrief |url=http://www.legalbrief.co.za/article.php?story=2002082769459999|date= 27 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foreworded by [[Thomas Berry]], the book was published by Green Books in November 2003 in association with The Gaia Foundation, London.  It was first published in South Africa, the author's home country, in August 2002 by Siber Ink.&lt;ref&gt;Temkin, Sanchia. 21 October 2002. Business Day (South Africa) ''Changing out approach to earth governance.''&lt;/ref&gt;

The feasibility of developing a new form of [[jurisprudence]] was discussed at a conference in [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] attended by Thomas Berry in April 2001, organised by the Gaia Foundation. A group of people involved with law and indigenous peoples attended from South Africa, Britain, Colombia, Canada and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Thomas Berry and an Earth Jurisprudence: An Exploratory Essay|url=http://connection.ebscohost.com/c/essays/35028715/thomas-berry-earth-jurisprudence-exploratory-essay|author=Mike Bell|publisher=The Trumpeter|volume=19|issue= 1|date=January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then ''Wild Law'' has been at the centre of many conferences and residential workshops: 
* A conference based on the concept of [[wild law]] was held in November 2005 at the [[University of Brighton]]. The conference was chaired by former Environment Minister [[Michael Meacher]] [[Member of Parliament|MP]] and speakers included Jacqueline McGlade, head of the [[European Environment Agency]] and Lynda Warren of the [[Environment Agency]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Former Environment Minister leads debate on 'Wild Law'|date=14 November 2005|url=http://www.brighton.ac.uk/news/2005/051114wildlaw.php?PageId=825|publisher=[[University of Brighton]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In November 2006, a conference based on the book was held at the University of Brighton in the UK and organised jointly by UKELA and ELF. 'A Walk on the Wild Side: Changing Environmental Law' and was chaired by John Elkington (of SustainAbility and the ELF Advisory Council) with guest speakers, Cormac Cullinan, Norman Baker MP (former Liberal Democrat Environment Spokesman), Satish Kumar (Resurgence) and Begonia Filgueira (Gaia Law Ltd).
* "A ‘Wild Law’ Response to Climate Change" workshop was held in September 2007 to develop a practical approach for applying Wild Law principles which are already helping shift legal processes in the US and South Africa. Organised by UKELA, with support from ELF and the Gaia Foundation, London and sponsored by the Body Shop. Held at a conference centre in Derbyshire in the UK, with internationally renowned speakers Cormac Cullinan, author of Wild Law, Professor Brian Goodwin, visiting scholar and teacher on MSc in Holistic Science, at the Schumacher College, International Centre for Ecological Studies, Devon, Andrew Kimbrell, executive director of The [[Center for Food Safety]] in United States and founder of the [[International Center for Technology Assessment]], Peter Roderick, director of the Climate Justice Programme and was Friends of the Earth’s lawyer in London from 1996.
* Wild Law was discussed in April 2007 at a conference, hosted by Center for Earth Jurisprudence, a collaborative initiative of Barry &amp; St. Thomas Universities, Florida, USA, on the emerging field of Earth Jurisprudence.&lt;ref&gt;[[Miami Herald]] 19 April 2007. ''Earth Jurisprudence'' Section: NC; Page 10.&lt;/ref&gt;
* The "’Wild Law’ - Ideas into Action" residential workshop is to be held in September 2008, to launch the first phase of international research by the UKELA and the Gaia Foundation to identify Wild Law in practice and provide a Wild Law toolkit for decision makers and practitioners. Held at a conference centre in Derbyshire in the UK, workshop leaders include: Mellese Damtie, Ethiopian lawyer and biologist, former Dean of the Legal Department at Ethiopia’s Civil Service College, Andrew Kimbrell, public interest attorney, activist and author, executive director of The Centre for Food Safety in United States and founder of the International Centre for Technology Assessment; and Professor Lynda Warren, emeritus professor at Aberystwyth University, environmental consultant and the research supervisor. Also participating, research paper coordinators, Begonia Filgueira, of Gaia Law Ltd and ERIC Ltd, and Ian Mason, practising barrister and Director of the Earth Jurisprudence Resource Centre; Cormac Cullinan, an environmental lawyer based in Cape Town, South Africa, author of Wild Law, director of the leading South African environmental law firm, Cullinan and Associates Inc., and CEO of EnAct International, an environmental governance consultancy; and Ng’anga Thiong’o, legal and policy adviser for Kenyan community NGO, Porini, and formerly to Green Belt Movement and Nobel prize winner, Wangari Maathai. This event is facilitated by Elizabeth Rivers, former commercial lawyer and professional facilitator, and Vicki Elcoate, Executive Director of UKELA.

The Tamaqua Borough Sewage Sludge Ordinance enacted in 2006 by the 7,000 inhabits of the community of Tamaqua, PA is based on the 2002 ideas set out in Wild Law and has been viewed potentially as one of the most important events of 2006.&lt;ref name="silver"&gt;[[Silver Donald Cameron|Cameron, Silver Donald.]] 11 January 2007. Rachel's Environment &amp; Health News. ''[http://www.precaution.org/lib/07/when_do_trees_have_standing.070108.htm When does a tree have rights?]'' Issue 889.&lt;/ref&gt;  Tamaqua's ordinance not only denies the right of corporations to spread sewage sludge as fertilizer on farmland, even when the farmer is willing, the ordinance recognizes natural communities and ecosystems as legal persons with legal rights.&lt;ref name="silver"/&gt; This ordinance is among the first " wild laws" to be passed anywhere in the world.&lt;ref name="silver"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1865">'''WorldWIT''' was a global online discussion community for [[women]] in [[business]] and [[technology]].

It was founded in 1999 as ChicWIT, in [[Chicago]]. ChicWIT was followed by MassWIT in [[Boston]], NycWIT in [[New York City]], and CapitolWIT in [[Washington, D.C.]] In October 2005 there were over 80 WorldWIT chapters in operation and over 40,000 members. Women (and a few men) used the daily WorldWIT [[newsletter]] to share business, technical, career, health, financial and life advice with one another.

WorldWIT was recognized in October 2004 as the Women's Business Organization of the Year, by the Stevie Awards Organization.

In March 2007, WorldWIT and its local city chapters were shut down.  This was the announcement:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
'''WORLDWIT FOUNDER BEGINS NEW CHAPTER'''&lt;br /&gt;
WorldWIT to close on March 23, 2007 – After seven years of connecting women in 25 countries around the globe, we are turning a corner and moving on to new endeavors.   
 . . . 
WorldWIT founder Liz Ryan’s demanding speaking and training schedule prevented her from taking the self-funded WorldWIT to the next level.
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

WorldWIT used [[L-Soft]] list serv technology and a robust website as the basis of its social networking platform.  Bill Phillips designed and managed both the listserv and website.  L-Soft published an online article featuring WorldWIT in 2005.  See http://www.lsoft.com/news/qa-issue2-2005-eu.asp

The '''''Wujing Zongyao''''' ({{zh|t=武經總要}}), sometimes rendered in English as the '''''Complete Essentials for the Military Classics''''', is a Chinese military [[compendium]] written from around 1040 to 1044.

The book was compiled during the [[Northern Song dynasty]] by [[Zeng Gongliang]] (曾公亮), Ding Du (丁度) and Yang Weide (楊惟德), whose writing influenced many later Chinese military writers. The compendium was published under the auspices of [[Emperor Renzong of Song]], who also authored the book's preface.{{sfn|Wang|1947|p=162}}  The book covers a wide range of subjects, including everything from naval [[warship]]s to different types of [[catapult]]s. It contains the earliest known written chemical formulas for [[gunpowder]], made from [[saltpeter]], [[sulphur]] and [[charcoal]] along with many added ingredients.{{sfn|Ebrey|1996|p=138}}{{sfn|Chase|2003}}  In addition to formulas for gunpowder, the compendium also contains details on various other gunpowder weapons such as [[fire arrow]]s, [[incendiary bomb]]s and projectiles, and [[grenade]]s and [[smoke bomb]]s.  It also describes an early form of the [[compass]] (using [[wikt: thermoremanent|thermoremanence]]), and has the oldest illustration of a Chinese [[Greek fire]] [[flamethrower]] with a double-action dual-[[piston]] cylinder-pump capable of shooting a continuous blast of flame.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=83}}

==History==
[[File:Renzong.jpg|thumb|Court portrait of [[Emperor Renzong of Song|Emperor Renzong]]]]
The ''Wujing Zongyao'' was compiled under the sponsorship of [[Emperor Renzong of Song]] (r. 1022–1063 AD),{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=19}}, who was concerned that many officials were unfamiliar with the military classics,{{sfn|Sawyer|2012|p=99}} and partially as a response to the Song dynasty's war with the [[Tangut people|Tangut]]s of [[Western Xia]].{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=33}} 

A team of scholars worked from 1040 to 1044 to compile the ''Wujing Zongyao'' with the intent to collect all known military knowledge{{sfnm|Needham|1987|1p=601|Needham|1987|2p=19}} and to disseminate it to a wider government audience.{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=33}} Its chief editor, Zeng Gongliang, was assisted by the [[astronomer]] Yang Weide and the scholar Ding Du.{{sfnm|Needham|1987|1p=601|Needham|1987|2p=19}} After five years, the book was published with a preface authored by Emperor Renzong himself.{{sfn|Wang|1947|p=162}} Lorge remarks that Zeng Gongliang, the chief editor, was a government official rather than a military general, implying that the ''Wujing Zongyao'' was likely written for other government officials.{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=33}}

Parts of the ''Wujing Zongyao'' were copied from older sources; historian Ralph D. Sawyer calls it "essentially a cut-and-paste job", containing many passages from earlier classical military writings whose original authors are left unidentified, a common practice at the time.{{sfn|Sawyer|2012|p=110}} During the Song dynasty, the ''Wujing Zongyao'' was appended to two other books: the ''Xingjun xuzhi'' and the ''Baizhan qifa'', both written by anonymous authors.{{sfn|Sawyer|2012|p=110}}

The ''Wujing Zongyao'' was one of 347 military treatises listed in the biographical chapters of the [[History of Song]] (1345 AD), one of the [[Twenty-Four Histories]].{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=19}} Of these 347 different military treatises from the Song period, only the ''Wujing Zongyao'', the ''Huqianjing'' (Tiger Seal Manual) of Xu Dong in 1004 AD, and fragments of similar works found in the later ''Yonglo Datian'', have survived.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=19}} The original text of the ''Wujing Zongyao'' was kept in the Imperial Library while a number of hand-written copies were distributed elsewhere, including a copy given to Wang Shao by [[Emperor Shenzong of Song]] in 1069 AD.{{sfn|Needham|1987|pp=19–20}}

The original copy of the ''Wujing Zongyao'' was lost during the [[Jin–Song Wars|Jin–Song wars]] when the invading [[Jin dynasty (1115–1234)|Jurchens]] sacked the Northern Song capital of [[Kaifeng]] in 1126 AD.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=20}} Only a few manuscripts survived as a result of its secretive nature. Very few trustees of the government were ever allowed to read it as increased propagation would have increased the chance of it falling into enemy hands.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=20}} A remaining copy of the ''Wujing Zongyao'' was remade into a newly published edition in 1231 AD in the [[Southern Song dynasty]].{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=20}} During the [[Ming Dynasty]] (1368–1644 AD), another book was published in 1439 AD featuring fragments of the ''Wujing Zongyao'' of 1231 while omitting some material and combining it with two other books, including a preface by Li Jin.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=21}} The entire ''Wujing Zongyao'' was reprinted in 1510 AD and this version is currently the oldest extant copy available.{{sfnm|Needham|1987|1p=601|Needham|1987|2p=20}} However, the historian [[Joseph Needham]] asserts that the 1510 AD edition is the most reliable in its faithfulness to the original version, since it was printed from blocks that were re-carved directly from tracings of the edition made in 1231 AD, rather than recombining fragments of the original with other material.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=20}}

After the ''Wujing Zongyao'' of 1510 was printed, other Ming copies were made. This included the [[Jiajing Emperor|Jiajing]] edition (1522–1566 AD), the [[Wanli Emperor|Wanli]] edition (1573–1619 AD) of [[Quanzhou]], and the Wanli edition (1573–1619) of [[Jinling]] by Tang Xinyün (preserved by Cunjingge).{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=20}} During the [[Qing Dynasty]] (1644–1911 AD) it was also reprinted in two different editions during the 18th century, and again in 1934 with the [[Shanghai]] edition.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=20}}

The ''Xu Wujing Zongyao'' (續武經總要; literally "Continuation of Wujing Zongyao") is a "continuation" of the ''Wujing Zongyao'' written in the late Ming dynasty. The book focuses primarily on army formations and military deployments.{{sfn|Sawyer|2012|p=110}} It was written by Fan Jingwen (1587–1644), who was then the Vice President of the Board of War (兵部尚書; ''bingbu shangshu''). Fan wrote the book because he felt that reprints of the ''Wujing Zongyao'' circulating at that time were out of date and did not take into account the technological and strategic changes that had occurred since the Song dynasty. The only surviving copy of the ''Xu Wujing Zongyao'' is held by [[Fudan University]] Library.{{sfn|Yates|2005|p=22}}

In the 3rd century, the Chinese engineer [[Ma Jun]] invented the [[south-pointing chariot]]. This was a wheeled vehicle that employed [[differential (mechanical device)|differential gearing]] in order to lock a figurine of an [[Xian (Taoism)|immortal]] in place on the end of a long wooden staff, the figure having its arm stretched out and always pointing to the southern [[cardinal direction]]. Although the authors of the ''Wujing Zongyao'' were mistaken in believing that the design of the south-pointing chariot was not handed down (as it was reinvented during the Song period and combined with an [[odometer]]), they described a new device which allowed one to navigate. This was the 'south pointing fish' (a thermoremanence [[compass]]), essentially a heated iron (or preferably steel) object cut in the shape of a fish and suspended in a bowl of water. The ''Wujing Zongyao'' part 1 volume 15 text stated:

{{quote |
When troops encountered gloomy weather or dark nights, and the directions of space could not be distinguished, they let an old horse go on before to lead them, or else they made use of the south-pointing carriage, or the south-pointing fish to identify the directions. Now the carriage method has not been handed down, but in the fish method a thin leaf of iron is cut into the shape of a fish two inches long and half an inch broad, having a pointed head and tail. This is then heated in a charcoal fire, and when it has become thoroughly red-hot, it is taken out by the head with iron tongs and placed so that its tail points due north. In this position it is quenched with water in a basin, so that its tail is submerged for several tenths of an inch. It is then kept in a tightly closed box. To use it, a small bowl filled with water is set up in a windless place, and the fish is laid as flat as possible upon the water-surface so that it floats, whereupon its head will point south.{{sfn|Needham|1962|p=252}}
}}

Later on in the Song dynasty the compass was used with maritime navigation.{{sfn|Mote|1999|p=326}} Several decades after the ''Wujing Zongyao'' was written, the scientist and statesman [[Shen Kuo]] (1031–1095 AD) wrote of the first truly magnetized compass needle in his book ''[[Dream Pool Essays]]'' (1088 AD). With a more efficient compass magnetized by [[lodestone]], the thermoremanence compass fell out of use.{{sfn|Needham|1962|pp=252–253}} The later maritime author [[Zhu Yu (author)|Zhu Yu]] wrote of the magnetic needle compass as a means to navigate at sea in his ''Pingzhou Table Talks'' of 1119 AD.{{sfn|Needham|1971|p=381}}{{sfn|Sivin|1995|p=22}}

==Naval technology==

The ''Wujing Zongyao'''s illustrated descriptions of warships had a significant influence on later naval handbooks and encyclopedias such as the naval section of the ''[[Wubei Zhi]]'' from circa 1628. These works would incorporate illustrations of ships originally from the ''Wujing Zongyao''. The use of pictures from the ''Wujing Zongyao'' would continue to appear in Japanese naval texts up until the 18th century. The illustrations were used by both Nishikawa Joken's ''Ka-i Tsūshō-kō'' (Studies on the Intercourse and Trade with Chinese and Barbarians) in 1708 and Kanazawa Kanemitsu's ''Wakan Senyōshū'' (Collected Studies on the Ships used by the Chinese and Japanese) in 1766.{{sfn|Needham|1971|p=381}}

The ''Wujing Zongyao'' divides Chinese warships into six categories: Tower ships (''lou chuan''), combat or war junks (''dou xian'' or ''zhan xian''), covered swoopers (''meng chong''), flying barques (''zou ge''), patrol boats (''you ting''), and sea hawk ships (''hai hu'').{{sfn|Turnbull|2002|pp=15–16}}{{sfn|Needham|1971|pp=424–425}} The ''Wujing Zongyao'''s typology for classifying Chinese warships would reappear in later naval texts for many centuries.{{sfn|Turnbull|2002|p=15}}

===Gunpowder weapons===
The ''Wujing Zongyao'' records detailed descriptions of gunpowder weapons such as incendiary projectiles, [[smoke bombs]], [[fire arrows]], and [[grenades]]. It documents incendiary projectiles containing low-nitrate gunpowder,{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=73}} which were launched from catapults or lowered down from city walls onto besiegers.{{sfn|Needham|1987|pp=70–71}} Examples of these incendiaries include the "swallow-tail" incendiary ({{lang|zh-Hant-TW|燕尾炬}}; ''yanweiju'') and the flying incendiary ({{lang|zh-Hant-TW|飛炬}}; ''feiju''). The swallow-tail incendiary was made of straw tied together and dipped in fat or oil. Chinese soldiers defending a city under siege would light the incendiary and lower it onto any wooden structure of the invading army to engulf it in fire. The flying incendiary visually resembled the swallow-tail incendiary, but was lowered using an iron chain from a [[swape]] lever installed within the walls of the city.{{sfn|Needham|1987|pp=70–71}} The book also describes an 'igniter ball' used in warfare and for finding the firing range. The ''Wujing Zongyao'' stated the following:

{{quote |
The 'igniter ball' (''yin huo qiu'') is made of paper round like a ball, inside which is put  between three and five pounds of powdered bricks. Melt yellow wax and let it stand until clear, then add powdered charcoal and make it into a paste permeating the ball; bind it up with hempen string. When you want to find the range of anything, shoot off this fire-ball first, then other incendiary balls can follow.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=73}}
}}

Gunpowder was attached to fire arrows ({{lang|zh-Hant-TW|火箭}}) and utilized as an incendiary.{{sfn|Wang|1947|p=165}} The ''Wujing Zongyao'' records that fire arrows were launched from bows or crossbows. The gunpowder used for fire arrows was likely a low-nitrate powder, and the quantity of gunpowder varied according to the type of bow.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=477}} In the book, the force of gunpowder is said to be enough to launch an arrow, but only when the elasticity of the crossbow is sufficient.{{sfn|Wang|1947|p=166}}

The ''Wujing Zongyao'' discusses various types of incendiary bombs and grenades. They used a low-nitrate gunpowder that, while not powerful enough to cause an explosion, was effective for incendiary weapons. The ''huoqiu'' ({{lang|zh-Hant-TW|火毬}}; literally "fire ball") was filled with gunpowder and launched using a trebuchet. Upon impact, the ''huoqiu'' would start a fire among an invading army.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=40}} Chinese bombs such as the thunder clap bomb or ''pili pao'' used a greater percentage of gunpowder than that of the ''huoqiu''. The gunpowder mixture for a bomb was placed within a rigid container that held in the expanding gas, allowing for more powerful explosions. The thunder clap bomb was constructed with a container made from bamboo.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=40}}

In the ''Wujing Zongyao'' and other military texts, the distinction between a bomb and a grenade is ambiguous. At the time, the Chinese usually did not categorize gunpowder weapons according to their delivery method. One of the few exceptions is the ''shoupao'', or hand bomb, which is analogous to the hand grenade.{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=40}}

===Formulas===

Gunpowder had already been invented prior to the ''Wujing Zongyao'' by Chinese alchemists in the 9th century.{{sfn|Lorge|2008|p=32}} Early references to gunpowder can be found in the Daoist book ''Zhenyuan miaodao yaolue'', written circa 850,{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=31}} and gunpowder was utilized in Chinese warfare as early as the 10th century in [[fire arrows]] and [[gunpowder]] [[Fuse (explosives)|fuse]]s used to light the Chinese two-piston [[flamethrower]].{{sfn|Needham|1987|pp=80–82}} 

However it was not until the ''Wujing Zongyao'' that the exact chemical formulas for early Chinese gunpowder was revealed.{{sfn|Wang|1947|p=177}} The ''Wujing Zongyao'' contains three formulas for gunpowder:{{sfn|Chase|2003|p=31}} one for an explosive bomb launched from a [[trebuchet]], another for a similar bomb with hooks attached so that it could latch on to any wooden structure and set it on fire, and another formula specified for a poison-smoke bomb used for [[chemical warfare]].{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=117}}

The ''Wujing Zongyao'''s first recorded gunpowder formula used in these bombs held a [[potassium nitrate]] level of 55.4% to 55.5%, sulfur content of 19.4% to 26.5%, and [[carbon]]aceous content of 23% to 25.2%.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=120}} The first step for making gunpowder is to powder and mix together sulphur, saltpetre, charcoal, pitch, and dried lacquer. Tung oil, dried plants, and wax are mixed next to create a paste. The paste and powder are combined and carefully stirred. Then the mixture is placed inside a paper container, wrapped up, and tied using hemp twine.{{sfn|Wang|1947|pp=161–162}} Several precautions are taken to prevent the gunpowder from becoming damp.{{sfn|Wang|1947|p=162}}

For the second formula, the inner ball alone had a nitrate percentage of 61.5% to 50.2%, a sulfur content of 30.8% to 25.1%, and if all carbonaceous matter was taken, 24.7%, if just taking the charcoal content alone, the carbon level was 7.7%.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=122}} If the outer coating and inner ball are both included with the second black-powder formula, that would yield a nitrate level of 34.7% to 54.8%, a sulfur content of 17.4% to 27.4%, and if all carbonaceous material is used, 47.9% carbon, if only charcoal is used, 17.8%.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=122}} If the inner ball of the third black-powder formula is only considered, it held nitrate levels of 39.6% if all carbonaceous matter was taken, 49.4% nitrate if excluding the poisons, and 60% if charcoal is specified alone.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=124}} The sulfur content was 19.8% if all carbonaceous matter was considered, 24.7% if this excluded poisons, and 30% if charcoal is specified alone.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=124}} The carbon content was 40.5% if all carbonaceous matter was considered, 25.9% if this excluded poisons, and 10% if charcoal alone was specified.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=124}} If both the inner ball and outer coating are considered for the third formula, that would yield a nitrate level of 27% if all carbonaceous matter was taken, 31.2% if this excluded poisons, and 51.7% if charcoal alone was used.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=124}} The sulfur content would be 13.5% if all carbonaceous matter was taken, 15.6% if this excluded the poisons, and 25.9% if only charcoal alone was specified.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=124}}  The carbon content was 59.5% if all carbonaceous matter was taken into account, 53.2% if this excluded poisons, and 22.4% if charcoal alone was specified.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=124}}

The first black-powder concoction was simply labeled as the "method for making the fire-chemical", with its ingredients and measured weight (in [[ounce]]s) of each ingredient listed in the section below with the others  listed in similar fashion.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=182}}

==Double-acting piston flamethrower==
[[File:Chinese Flamethrower.JPG|thumb|right|200px|A Chinese [[flamethrower]] from the ''Wujing Zongyao'']]
The ''Wujing Zongyao'' describes a flamethrower with a double-acting two-[[piston]] cylinder-pump capable of shooting a continuous blast of flame.{{sfn|Gernet|1982|p=310}} The first Chinese battle to use the double-piston pump flamethrower was the [[Battle of Langshan Jiang]] in 919 AD. In the Battle of Langshan Jiang (Wolf Mountain River, 狼山江), the naval fleet of the Wenmu King of Wuyue defeated the fleet of the Kingdom of Wu because he had used 'fire oil' (huo yóu, 火油) to burn his fleet; this signified the first Chinese use of gunpowder in warfare, since a slow-burning match fuse was required to ignite the flames.{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=81}} [[Greek fire]] is likely based on distilled petroleum and is a weapon of [[Byzantine Empire|Byzantine]] origin.{{sfn|Turnbull|2001|p=40}} The Chinese author Lin Yu explained in his book of 919 AD that Greek fire was acquired from their [[Arab]] [[maritime trade]] contacts in the [[Indian Ocean]].{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=82}} Furthermore, the Chinese had been using the piston [[syringe]] since the [[Han Dynasty]] (202 BC – 220 AD).{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=84}} However, it was the later ''Wujing Zongyao'' that would provide the first illustrated drawing and greater textual explanation for how this flamethrower operated. In describing the drawn illustration of the flamethrower in the book, the ''Wujing Zongyao'' states:

{{quote | On the right is the [[petrol]] flamethrower (lit. fierce fire oil-shooter). The tank is made of [[brass]], and supported on four legs. From its upper surface arise four (vertical) tubes attached to a horizontal cylinder above; they are all connected with the tank. The head and the tail of the cylinder are large (the middle) is of narrow (diameter). In the tail end there is a small opening as big as a millet grain. The head end has (two) round openings 1½ inches in diameter. At the side of the tank there is a hole with a (little) tube which is used for filling, and this is fitted with a cover. Inside the cylinder there is a (piston-)rod packed with [[silk]] floss, the head of which is wound round with hemp waste about ½ inches thick. Before and behind, the two communicating tubes are (alternately) occluded (lit. controlled), and (the mechanism) thus determined. The tail has a horizontal handle (the pump handle), in front of which there is a round cover. When (the handle is pushed) in (the pistons) close the mouth of the tubes (in turn).{{sfn|Needham|1987|p=82}}}}

{{quote | Before use the tank is filled with rather more than three catties of the oil with a spoon through a filter; at the same time gunpowder (composition) is placed in the ignition chamber at the head. When the fire is to be started one applies a heated [[branding iron]] (to the ignition chamber), and the piston-rod is forced fully into the cylinder—then the man at the back is ordered to draw the piston rod fully backwards and work it (back and forth) as vigorously as possible. Whereupon the oil (the petrol) comes out through the ignition chamber and is shot forth as blazing flame.{{sfn|Needham|1987|pp=83–84}}}}

Then the text goes on to provide further instructions about equipment, maintenance, and repair of flamethrowers:

{{quote | When filling, use the bowl, the spoon and filter; for igniting there is the branding iron; for maintaining (or renewing) the fire there is the container. The branding iron is made sharp like an [[wikt:awl|awl]] so that it may be used to unblock the tubes if they get stopped up. There are tongs with which to pick up the glowing fire, and there is a [[soldering iron]] for stopping up leaks. If the tanks or the tubes get cracked and leak they may be mended by using green wax. Altogether there are 12 items of equipment, all of brass except the tongs, the branding iron, and the soldering iron. Another method is to fix a brass [[gourd]]-shaped container inside a large tube; below it has two feet, and inside there are two small feet communicating with them (comm: all made of brass) and there is also the piston. The method of shooting is as described above. If the enemy comes to attack a city, these weapons are placed on the great [[defensive wall|rampart]]s, or else in outworks, so that large numbers of assailants cannot get through.{{sfn|Needham|1987|pp=83–84}}}}
