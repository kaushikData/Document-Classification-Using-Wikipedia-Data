The '''{{lang|en|All Alaska Sweepstakes}}''' was an annual [[Sled dog racing|dog-sled race]] held in [[Alaska]] during April. Mushers traveled from [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] to [[Candle, Alaska|Candle]], traveling along the [[Arctic Ocean|Bering Strait]], and then return to Nome.

Between 1908 and 1917 the race was held ten times. Due to the [[United States]]' involvement in the [[World War I|Great War]] and new [[List of sled dog races|dog-sled races]] elsewhere in [[North America]], the race was discontinued. Two commemorative events occurred in 1983 and 2008, to mark the 75th and 100th anniversaries of the first race, respectively.

== History ==
[[File:All_Alaska_Sweepstakes_Race.JPG|thumb|right|Start of 1915 {{lang|en|All Alaska Sweepstakes}}]]
In 1907, the local administrators of the Nome Kennel Club in [[Nome, Alaska]], developed plans for a long-distance dog-sled race that followed a route along the Bering Strait. The first race, named the All Alaska Sweepstakes, took place in the spring of 1908. The competition was held annually until the final race in 1917.

To be in the race, participants were required to register by November. Each team had anywhere from 10 to 20 dogs. The race started in [[Nome, Alaska|Nome]] and followed [[Telegraphy|telegraphic]] lines to [[Candle, Alaska|Candle]], Alaska, before retracing the route to Nome. The telegraphic lines enabled the mushers to communicate their checkpoint times and ranks to the media. The stop numbers and places were uncontrolled, so stewards were placed at each stop along the journey to resupply teams.

[[Mushing|Mushers]] were required to finish the race with as many dogs as they started with, whether they were alive, injured or dead. This rule encouraged participants to take adequate care of their dogs, since an injured or dead dog would be a great drawback. To help minimize the weight on each sled, a minimum amount of items such as clothes, water and shoes for the dogs was loaded.

The '''Bahamas national rugby union team''' represent the [[Bahamas]] in the sport of [[rugby union]]. The team have thus far not qualified for a [[Rugby World Cup]], but have participated in qualifying tournament. The nation is classified as tier three by the [[International Rugby Board]] (IRB).

==History==
The Bahamas made their international debut on March 22, 1997 in a match against [[Bermuda national rugby union team|Bermuda]]. Bermuda won the contest 24 points to 3. The Bahamas played [[Barbados national rugby union team|Barbados]] that April, and in the process won their first international; defeating Barbados 37-23. The team played three internationals during October 1998; although the Bahamas lost all three games, against Bermuda, [[Trinidad &amp; Tobago national rugby union team|Trinidad &amp; Tobago]] and [[Jamaica national rugby union team|Jamaica]].

The Bahamas compete in the [[Caribbean Championship]], a tournament which includes [[Antigua and Barbuda national rugby union team|Antigua]], [[Trinidad and Tobago national rugby union team|Trinidad and Tobago]], the [[Cayman Islands national rugby union team|Cayman Islands]], [[Jamaica national rugby union team|Jamaica]], the [[Bermuda national rugby union team|Bermuda]], [[British Virgin Islands national rugby union team|British Virgin Islands]], and [[Guyana national rugby union team|Guyana]].&lt;ref name=Completerugby&gt;Bath, Richard (ed.) ''The Complete Book of Rugby'' (Seven Oaks Ltd, 1997 {{ISBN|1-86200-013-1}}) p78&lt;/ref&gt;

They played a one-off international in 2001, losing to Barbados 18 points to 25. Another international was played in June 2003, where they lost 7 to 13 to the [[Cayman Islands national rugby union team|Cayman Islands]]. The Bahamas took part in the [[2007 Rugby World Cup - Americas qualification|Americas qualifying tournaments]] for the [[2007 Rugby World Cup]] in [[France]]. They won their first two matches, defeating the Cayman Islands and Bermuda, but lost their third against Jamaica. However, they did finish at the top of the Northern Pool, clinching the play-off match against the winner of the other pool. The Bahamas lost to Barbados in the play-off match, 52-3.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2899">A '''ball hog''' is a derisive term for a player who handles the ball exclusively to the point of impairing the team. Despite not being a violation of the [[rules of basketball]], "ball-hogging" is generally considered unacceptable playing behavior at all levels of basketball competition. The term is highly subjective, and any individual player might be considered a ball hog by some observers but not by others.

Ball-hogging usually involves excessive shooting of difficult [[Jump shot (basketball)|shots]], especially when other players are in advantageous positions. Ball hogs attempt to monopolize their play of the ball, frequently [[Dribble#Basketball|dribbling]] excessively and infrequently passing the ball to a teammate.&lt;ref name=dummies&gt;{{cite web | url =http://www.dummies.com/how-to/content/dealing-with-a-ball-hog-on-your-basketball-team.html | first = Greg  | last = Bach | title = Dealing with a Ball Hog on Your Basketball Team | publisher = For Dummies | accessdate = 1 Jan 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ball-hogging tends to manifest itself statistically as an abnormally high percentage of team shot attempts by the ball hog and often low percentages of shot accuracy and assists.  They also tend to have a very poor assist-to-turnover ratio, used as the main statistical indicator of how well a player "shares" the ball.

Ball-hogging can be detrimental to a team both immediately and in the long term.  For instance, a player with ball-hogging tendencies may overlook or neglect a teammate who is open for a relatively easy shot, choosing instead to take a more difficult shot himself, often at the team's expense. Additionally, repeated ball-hogging by a player can damage a team's cohesiveness and alienate the player from his teammates, coaches, and fans. Another example of a ball hog is a player whose aim is to boost his statistics.  This could be done even through assists. A player who tries to do the most of everything - holding the ball and executing all the plays, from scoring to assisting, when it is detrimental to the outcome of the game - can also be known as a ball hog.

In professional leagues, when an exceptionally competent player takes control of the ball a large amount of the time, but it is in the team's best interest due to the player's very high shot percentage and low turnover rate, and low availability of similarly skilled players on the team, he is not usually considered a ball hog. The expectation of a professional team is to play in the manner which will produce the most team wins, which will naturally lead to an imbalance among teammates of differing skill levels. However, in amateur and children's basketball, monopolizing the ball is often considered unsportsmanlike regardless of the effect it has on the team's wins.

[[File:Game 3 of the 2006 NBA Finals.jpg|thumb|right|The home court of the [[Miami Heat]] of the [[National Basketball Association]]]] In [[basketball]], the '''basketball court''' is the playing surface, consisting of a rectangular floor with baskets at either end. In professional or organized basketball, especially when played indoors, it is usually made out of a [[wood]], often [[maple]], and highly polished and completed with a 10 foot rim. Outdoor surfaces are generally made from standard paving materials such as [[concrete]] or [[asphalt concrete|asphalt]].

== Dimensions ==
Basketball courts come in different sizes. In the [[National Basketball Association]] (NBA), the court is {{convert|94|by|50|ft|m|sigfig=3}}. Under [[FIBA|International Basketball Federation]] (FIBA) rules,&lt;ref name="FIBA2006Rules"&gt;{{cite web | year = 2006 | url = http://www.fiba.com/asp_includes/download.asp?file_id=328 | title = Official Basketball Rules 2006 | format = pdf | work =  | publisher = [[FIBA|International Basketball Federation]] | accessdate = 2007-04-14| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20070406072645/http://www.fiba.com/asp_includes/download.asp?file_id=328| archivedate= 6 April 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt; the court is minutely smaller, measuring exactly {{convert|28|by|15|meters|ft|sigfig=3}}. In amateur basketball, court sizes vary widely. The baskets are always {{convert|10|ft|m|sigfig=3}} above the floor (except possibly in youth competition). Basketball courts have a three-point arc at both baskets. A basket made from behind this arc is worth three points; a basket made from within this line, or with a player's foot touching the line, is worth 2 points. The free-throw line, where one stands while taking a foul shot, is located within the three-point arc at 15 feet from the basket. A foul shot is worth 1 point, but if a shot is made from the foul line while in play it is still worth 2 points.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Wissel|first=Hal|title=Basketball: steps to success|year=1994|publisher=Human Kinetics Publishers, Inc.|location=United States|isbn=0-7360-5500-2|pages=ix}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sections==
[[File:Basketball terms.png|thumb|300px|Most important terms related to the basketball court]]
===Center circle===
The only two players permitted to enter this area prior to the tipoff are the players contesting the jump ball (usually but not always centers). Both players jump when the referee throws the ball in the air, each attempting to tap the ball into the hands of a player of their own team.

===Three-point line===
The three-point line is the line that separates the two-point area from the [[three-point field goal|three-point area]]; any shot converted beyond this line counts as three points. If the shooting player steps on the line, it is counted as two points. Any foul made in the act of shooting beyond the three-point line would give the player three [[free throws]] if the shot does not go in, and one if it does.

The distance to the [[three-point field goal|three-point]] line from the center of the basket varies depending on the level or league, and has changed several times. These are the current distances, with the league or level using each distance:

* 19.75&amp;nbsp;ft (6.02 m): High School
* 20.75&amp;nbsp;ft (6.32 m): NCAA
* 21.65&amp;nbsp;ft (6.60 m) to 22.15&amp;nbsp;ft (6.75 m): WNBA and FIBA
* 22&amp;nbsp;ft (6.71 m) to 23.75&amp;nbsp;ft (7.24 m): NBA

The NBA adopted the three-point line at the start of the [[1979–80 NBA season|1979–80 season]]. This is of variable distance, ranging from {{convert|22|ft|m}} in the corners to {{convert|23.75|ft|m}} behind the top of the key. During the 1994–95, 1995–96 and 1996–97 seasons, the NBA attempted to address decreased scoring by shortening the overall distance of the line to a uniform {{convert|22|ft|m}} around the basket. It was moved back to its original distance after the 1996–97 season. FIBA and the NCAA both adopted the three-point line in 1985.

In most high school associations in the United States, the distance is 19.75 feet. This was formerly the distance for [[college basketball]] as well. On May 26, 2007, the NCAA playing rules committee agreed to move the three-point line back one foot to 20.75 feet for the men. This rule went into effect for the 2008–2009 season. The three-point line for women (NCAA) moved back one foot to 20.75 feet at the start of the 2011–2012 season.

The international distance, used in most countries outside the United States and in [[FIBA]] and [[WNBA]] competition, is currently 6.6&amp;nbsp;m (21.65&amp;nbsp;ft) to 6.75&amp;nbsp;m (22.15&amp;nbsp;ft).

===Perimeter===
The perimeter is defined as the areas outside the free throw lane and inside the three-point line. Shots converted (successfully made) from this area are called "perimeter shots" or "medium-range shots."
If a player's foot is on the three-point line, the shot is considered a perimeter shot.

===Low post area===
The low post is defined as the areas that are closest to the basket but outside of the free throw lane.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nbaballers.org/BasketballGlossary/Basketball-Glossary-L.html Basketball Glossary Terms, Definition, Lane violation, Low post&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090430102709/http://nbaballers.org/BasketballGlossary/Basketball-Glossary-L.html |date=April 30, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This area is fundamental to strategy in basketball. Skilled low post players can score many points per game without ever taking a [[Jump shot (basketball)|jump shot]].

=== Key ===
The [[key (basketball)|key]], free throw lane or shaded lane refers to the usually painted area beneath the basket; for the NBA it is {{convert|16|ft|m}} wide, for the NCAA it is {{convert|12|ft|m}} wide; for both instances it extends {{convert|15|ft|m}} from the backboard. At the top of the rectangle is the [[free throw]] line, behind which players shoot uncontested shots when they're fouled. A circle is drawn around the free-throw line with a {{convert|6|ft|m}} [[radius]]; this is used for jump ball instances, as is done at the [[#Center circle|center circle]].  Two 6-inch hash lines, 3&amp;nbsp;ft from the free throw lane line and 5&amp;nbsp;ft 8 in from the free throw line, show the lower defensive box linked to the restricted area.

For FIBA tournaments, since October 2010 the key has been a rectangle 4.9 m wide and 5.8 m long. Previously it was a trapezoid 3.7 meters (12&amp;nbsp;ft) wide at the free-throw line and 6 meters (19 feet and 6.25&amp;nbsp;inches) at the end line.

The key is primarily used to prevent players from staying beneath the basket of the opponents' team for long periods (maximum three seconds).

The restricted area arc is a semi-circular arc drawn around the area directly underneath the basket. With some exceptions, members of the defending team cannot draw charging fouls in this area.
The restricted arc in all North American rule sets above high school level ([[National Collegiate Athletic Association|NCAA]] men's and women's, [[National Basketball Association|NBA]], and [[Women's National Basketball Association|WNBA]]) has a radius 4 feet (1.22 m) from below the center of the basket. The restricted area arc rule first appeared at any level of basketball in the NBA in the 1997-98 season.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://factuation.com/shaq-and-the-no-charge-zone-rule/ |title=Shaq and the No Charge Zone Rule |publisher=Factuation |date=July 1, 2015 |website=Factuation |access-date=February 27, 2018 |quote=In the 1997-1998 season, NBA added the “no charge zone” or the “restricted area”. This is the portion of the key, denoted by an arc in the painted area that is positioned four feet from the basket. The arc is important because a defending player can not force a charging foul within this area. It was designed to provide benefit offensive post-up player like [Shaquille] O’Neal, players who drive to the basket and limit collisions.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The NCAA restricted area arc was originally established for the 2011–12 men's and women's seasons at a {{conv|3|ft|adj=on}} radius from below the center of the basket, and was extended to match the (W)NBA radius for the 2015–16 season and beyond.

===Other lines===
On NBA floors, two hash marks are drawn at the end lines near the key to mark the area known as the lower defensive box. A defensive player is allowed to draw a charging foul within the restricted arc if the offensive player receives the ball and/or starts his drive within this area.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nba.com/nba101/misunderstood_0708.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, two lines are drawn on each of the sidelines, 28 feet from each of the endlines, which designates the extent of the coaching box and bench. This line marks the farthest extent a coach (aside from the sidelines) can stand. Directly behind this area is the team bench.

On the half-court line of NBA floors two lines extend outside the playing court, designating the place where substitutes wait before they can enter the playing court; directly behind this area are the various off-court officials such as the timekeeper and reserve referee.

===FIBA changes===

On April 26, 2008, FIBA announced several major rules changes involving the court markings. These changes took effect for major international competitions on October 1, 2010, after that year's World Championships [[2010 FIBA World Championship|for men]] and [[2010 FIBA World Championship for Women|women]], and became mandatory for other competitions on October 1, 2012 (although national federations could adopt the new markings before 2012). The changes were as follows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/news/lateNews/p/newsid/24352/arti.html |title=The FIBA Central Board approves historic rule changes |publisher=FIBA |date=2008-04-26 |accessdate=2008-04-28| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080430210952/http://www.fiba.com/pages/eng/fc/news/lateNews/p/newsid/24352/arti.html| archivedate= 30 April 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The shape of the key changed from a trapezoid to a rectangle as it is in the NBA, with NBA dimensions.
* The three-point line moved back to 6.75 meters (22&amp;nbsp;ft 1.7 in) from 6.25 meters (20&amp;nbsp;ft 6.1 in), compared to {{convert|23|ft|9|in|m|abbr=on}} for the NBA at the top of the arc.
* The FIBA adopted the NBA's restricted area arc with a marginally wider radius of 1.25 meters (4&amp;nbsp;ft 1.2 in).

'''Chajeon Nori''', occasionally translated as '''Juggernaut Battle''', is a traditional [[List of Korean games|Korean game]] usually played by men, originating in the [[Andong]] region.  It may have originated as a commemoration of [[Wang Geon]]'s victory over [[Gyeon Hwon]] at the [[Battle of Gochang]]([[Andong]]) in 930, near the end of the [[Later Three Kingdoms of Korea|Later Three Kingdoms]] period.  It resembles a jousting match, with the two commanders are atop large log frames maneuvered by their teams.  These trapezoidal log frames are known as ''dongchae'', and are composed of two 10-meter-long logs tied together with straw rope.  The ''dongchae'' lie horizontally at the beginning of play, but then are hoisted up by their team.   Some members of the team carry the ''dongchae'', while others fight with the opposing team to help their side advance.  

The commanders are chosen from among the team at the beginning of play.  The teams are traditionally named "east" and "west."  A team wins by forcing the other team's ''dongchae'' to the ground.  After their victory, the members of the winning team traditionally toss their straw sandals upward.

The '''Dunc Gray Velodrome''' is an Australian velodrome located at [[Bass Hill]] approximately 5 kilometres north west of the [[Sydney]] suburb of [[Bankstown, New South Wales|Bankstown]].  The cycling venue for the 2000 Olympic games, the Dunc Gray Velodrome was opened on 28 November 1999 and is named after [[Edgar "Dunc" Gray]], the first Australian to win a cycling Gold Medal at the [[Olympic Games]] ([[1932 Summer Olympics|Los Angeles 1932]]).&lt;ref name="Beech"&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.dailytelegraph.com.au/newslocal/south-west/sydney-olympics-future-plans-for-dunc-gray-velodrome-15-years-after-olympics/news-story/9a90bd2c419e0d8ff42cb30733f11dd2 | title=Sydney Olympics: Future plans for Dunc Gray Velodrome 15 years after Olympics | work=Canterbury-Bankstown Express | author=James Beech | date=2015-08-11 | accessdate=2016-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the time of its construction, the State Government owned the velodrome.  Bankstown Council managed the velodrome under a sublease.  In 1998, the council sublet the velodrome to Bankstown Sports Club, under a 21-year sublease.  The council is scheduled to resume control of the velodrome in 2019.&lt;ref name="Beech"/&gt;

==Construction==
Costing $42 million as a [[Cycling at the 2000 Summer Olympics|track cycling]] venue for the [[2000 Summer Olympics|Sydney 2000 Olympics]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.la84.org/6oic/OfficialReports/2000/2000v1.pdf 2000 ''Official Report of the XXVII Summer Olympiad.  Volume One - Preparing for the Games''.  Sydney Organising Committee for the Olympic Games (2001), p. 373.]&lt;/ref&gt; construction of the velodrome, as well as an 800m Criterium Practice Track, commenced in May 1998 and finished in November 1999. It currently has a [[seating capacity]] of 3,150, but was expanded to 5,821 seats to cater for the 2000 Olympics.

At 250 metres length, 60 kilometres worth of Baltic Pine (Finland) were used in its composition. The track bends at a maximum angle of 42° degrees, while the straights are at 12.5°. The Safety Track is 5 metres wide and the racing surface is of 7 metres width.

==Events==
The first major international cycling event ever held was the Oceania International Cycling Grand Prix from 8 to 12 December 1999&amp;nbsp;– an official pre-Olympic test event.

In April 2000 it hosted the 'Bankstown Millennium Buzz' performance in celebrating the Olympics and the millennium year. It hosted six days of track cycling events at the [[2000 Summer Olympics]], as well as Paralympic cycling.

In October 2007, The Dunc Gray Velodrome hosted the 2007 UCI Track Cycling Masters World Championships, for riders 30+ years of age.

'''GAA Scores''' is a [[podcast]] and website about [[Gaelic Athletic Association|Gaelic Games]].

==History==
GAA Scores was originally launched as a [[Twitter]] account by Conor Donnelly in January 2012, with updates from [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]] teams in various countries. The debut match was a [[Dr. McKenna Cup]] tie between [[Derry GAA|Derry]] and [[Ulster University#Jordanstown|UUJ]] at [[Celtic Park (Derry)|Celtic Park]]. The account received almost 1,000 followers on Twitter within the first week. Later that summer a website was founded with news and opinions on Gaelic Games.

The podcast was launched in May 2013 with Conor Donnelly, Pearse Corcoran and Michael O'Connor hosting the first season. [[Fermanagh GAA|Fermanagh]] footballer [[Ryan McCluskey]] replaced O'Connor midway through the second season.

==Podcast format==
The show is released weekly through [[iTunes]] and [[SoundCloud]].

==Link up with Gaelic Life==

An '''International Measurer of Sailing''' is a type of highly experienced [[Boat racing|race]] [[referee|official]] who has two principal functions in the sport of [[sailing]]: certification control and regatta equipment inspection.

For classes of [[yacht]]s that require it, measurers check that new equipment ([[Hull (watercraft)|hulls]], appendages, spas, [[sail]]s, etc.) complies with class rules before it can be used in competition. Where required by the organizers of a [[regatta]], measurers check that equipment during the regatta is compliant with class rules.

The most experienced measurers may become "International Measurers" recognised by the [[International Sailing Federation]].

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12644">[[File:Look Nevada binding.jpg|thumb|right|The original Look Nevada toe binding. Early examples, like this model, did not have a standardized flange to clip to on the toe, and the cup area is larger than later models. When boots were better standardized, the cup evolved into two "fingers", but the basic operation remained unchanged to this day.]]

Look's '''Nevada''', released in 1950, was the first recognizably modern alpine [[ski binding]]. The Nevada was only the toe portion of the binding, and was used with a conventional [[cable binding]] for the heel. An updated version was introduced in 1962 with a new step-in heel binding, the '''Grand Prix'''. These basic mechanisms formed the basis for LOOK bindings for over 40 years, changing mainly in name and construction materials. The Nevada toe pattern is almost universal among bindings today.

==History==
===Background===
In the immediate post-[[World War II]] era, most downhill ski bindings were of the "Kandahar" pattern of [[cable binding]]. This consisted of a metal cup at the front of the ski that kept the boot centred, with a leather strap buckled over the toe to hold it down into the cup. A long metal cable or spring ran around the back of the boot, over a flange protruding from the heel. The strap held the boot forward and kept the toe in the cup and under the strap. The system was designed to keep the toe firmly in place while allowing the heel to rise off the ski. This allowed for a smooth cross-country striding motion. For downhill use, the cable was clipped down near the heel to keep the boot in firmer contact with the ski, and allow some level of lateral control.&lt;ref name=lert&gt;Lert, pg. 26&lt;/ref&gt;

The major problem with these bindings is they did not release in the case of an accident. In particular, if the forward tip of the ski rotated to the side, the force was transmitted through the length of the ski to the boot, forming a huge [[Moment (physics)|moment arm]]. Even small forces could produce [[torque]]s able to break the ankle or knee, and spiral fractures of the calf were common. This was not as much of an issue in cross-country where the heel was relatively free to move, but in downhill use when the cable was clipped down this was a serious concern.&lt;ref name=lert/&gt; In the 1950s it was estimated that a skier had a 1% chance of suffering an injury on any given day, and that 10% of skiers would suffer a fracture over a single season.&lt;ref&gt;Seth Masia, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-JLvKdmbA1AC&amp;pg=PA28 "Twist 'n Shout: A History of Injuries"], ''Ski Heritage'', June 2003, pg. 28&lt;/ref&gt;

In the immediate post-war era there were a few halting attempts to address this problem. However, most suffered from the problem that the leather ski boots wore down quickly and the mounting point between the binding and boot was thus subject to constant change. Some designs address this by having the user screw metal fixings onto the boot sole to provide a more solid mounting point, but these would only fit a single style of binding. In any event, they required constant adjustment and were often complex. Richard Spademan, inventor of the [[Spademan binding]], would later dismissing them all, stating "Bindings were trash."&lt;ref name=m39&gt;Masia, pg. 39&lt;/ref&gt;

===Beyl's plate===
French sporting goods manufacturer Jean Beyl made one of the first attempts to solve the twisting fall problem. His design pivoted around a bearing under the foot, in order to ensure that torque did not built up to dangerous levels. Although it did not release the boot from the ski, it did release the force from the boot. To mount it, the boot was fastened to a metal plate, which was in turn cut into the upper surface of the ski in a mortise joint about a centimetre deep. The system was difficult to install, weakened the ski, and also heavy.

Beyl wanted a sexy name for the company, and took one from a [[Look (American magazine)|US photo magazine]]. Look was formed in [[Nevers]], France in 1948. The system saw limited sales, but was in use on the French ski team by 1950.

===Nevada===
Beyl was a perfectionist and was unhappy with his plate design. What he wanted was a lightweight solution that was easier to mount, yet retained the ability to absorb lateral forces.

His next design used a C-shaped piece that fit over the toe of the boot, eliminating the plate. The toe of a contemporary ski boot is essentially hemispherical, so the single clip kept the boot centred and, by riding over the top of it, pressed down onto the ski. Under a pure sideways release scenario, the clip would rotate to allow the boot to exit. However, if the force was also to the front, as in the case of the ski tip catching a tree root or front of a [[Mogul skiing|mogul]], the pivot would be too close to the line of motion to allow easy rotation. To address this, the entire body of the binding was also pivoted. In this sort of release scenario, the binding as a whole would rotate, and eventually the force would be far enough to the side that the clip would be forced sideways.

As before, Beyl wanted a US-sounding name for his new binding, and selected "Nevada". The binding was released in 1950, along with a Nevada-branded cable binding of conventional design. The Nevada toe was the first modern ski binding that worked safely with any unmodified boot, eschewing attempts to attach to the sole or use add-on plates or clips. The basic two-pivot design has become universal, and used with only minor modifications to this day.

===Nevada II and Grand Prix===
Through the 1950s, Look's only real competitor in Europe was [[Marker (ski bindings)|Marker]], who introduced their Duplex design in 1952. The Duplex improved on the Nevada by using two clips to hold the toe, rather than a single cup. By locating the clips at the corners of the binding, even falls that created straightforward pressure would cause it to open - the clips would be forced outwards and create sideways forces for the main pivot under the binding. In 1953 was replaced in production by the Simplex, which used a single cup like the Nevada, but retained the action of the Duplex and allowed straightforward release. Look and Marker competed for the majority of the European market through the 1950s and into the early 1960s. 

In 1962 Look dramatically updated their line with the introduction of the '''Nevada II'''. The new design used a single pivot point under the binding as before, but replaced the rotating cup with two longer fingers. The action to the original Marker Duplex design. However, the use of the two fingers had two effects, for one it allowed a much wider range of boot shapes to be accommodated, and for another, it allowed the boot to travel much further within the binding before it would release. Other bindings with shorter travel were subject to "pre-release", where a short, sharp force would pop the binding even when the movement would not have been enough to cause damage to the leg. This allowed the Nevada II to be safely used at much lower tension settings, improving the chances of it releasing when needed while still preventing pre-release.

At the same time, Look introduced their '''Grand Prix''' heel binding. This was essentially one half of a Nevada system, turned sideways so it released vertically instead of to the sides. With cable bindings the heel was normally held down by looping the cable over the heel or cupped it in a semi-circular indentation on the back of the heel. To fit these different styles of binding points, and the fact that the boots had no standardized size or shape, the rotating portion of the Grand Prix was mounted on a bracket that lifted it above the heel flange, allowing the user to adjust its height. The actual binding point was a bronze roller sized to be similar to a standard cable, this could clip on top of the heel, or would fit into the indentation cut into the heel of some boots.

The Grand Prix offered step-in convenience; to put the binding on, the skier inserted their toe under the Nevada II, then stepped down at the heel. The sole of their boot would catch a small plate or rod extending from the bottom of the binding, rotating it until it flipped up to lie vertically behind the skier's leg. During this motion the roller would catch the sole of the boot and lock it into position. Like the Nevada toe, a strong force rotating the boot, this time forward, would cause the binding to release.

===Further improvements===
[[File:Look bindings from N17 to 89.jpg|thumb|right|A variety of Look bindings from the original N17 to models typical for the 1990s. The operating principles remain the same throughout, all that changes are the materials and basic layout.]]

As the value of low-friction devices to aid boot release became clear in the late 1960s, Look modified the Nevada II into the '''Nevada T''' to take advantage of the [[teflon]] pads that were becoming common in the industry. In addition to a pad on top of the ski under the toe, Look also added a second smaller pad where the very front of the boot pressed under the Nevada's toe clips. The pad was shaped to force the boot sideways in the event of a forward fall, further adding to the forces trying to release the toe.

This basic Grand Prix system was later improved with the addition of a rotating platform under the heel of the boot, known as the "turntable", which stopped the boot from jamming on the heel release's arms when the toe was releasing to the side. These improvements were released as the '''Look Nevada N17''' in the late 1960s. The name now referred to both the toe and heel release as a pair, the separate Grand Prix name was dropped. The N17 was replaced by the similar N57 and N77 from the mid-1970s, which was improved in a number of minor ways, notably the option of a [[ski brake]] just behind the toe binding.

The Nevada patents ran out in 1976, a similar models with long-travel toes quickly appeared from other binding manufacturers, starting with Salomon.&lt;ref&gt;Release, pg. 30.&lt;/ref&gt; These replaced earlier designs, which generally used a single cup-shaped piece that fitted over the entire toe flange (as opposed to the toe, as in the original Nevada). These had the disadvantage of requiring careful adjustment to fit the height of the toe flange, and could be impacted if snow on the bottom of the heel lifted the toe upward. Today the Nevada-style "two finger toe" is universal among modern bindings.

[[File:New and old Look bindings.jpeg|thumb|right|Three decades of Look bindings: On the left is a Nevada II toe and Grand Prix heel, while the right side has a Rossignol-branded version of the 1990s Look Pivot. Both are sitting on a pair of [[Head Standard]] skis.]]

The N77, in turn, gave rise to the 89 and 99, a series of bindings for different skill levels, collectively referred to as the '''Look Pivot'''. The Pivot also introduced a button directly in front of the toe under the binding arms. When the boot slid forward along the ski, the boot would press on the button which released tension in the binding and made it much easier to release. This was a further improvement on the series of design changes improving the forward release capabilities of the toe. The ultimate evolution was the XM version, which also allowed the toe piece to rotated directly up, as is the case in a backward fall.

===Current models===
Various models of the Pivot were Look's primary offering into the 1990s. When Look was purchased in 1994 by Rossignol, they re-branded the Pivot under their own name. Look-branded versions re-appeared in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;Look press release, [http://www.powdermag.com/industry-news-and-events/look-and-rossi-return-the-pivotturntable-binding/ "The PIVOT is Back"], 1 December 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout its long history, Look's only other major binding design was the [[Look Integral]], which was aimed at ski rental shops.

'''McNichols Sports Arena''' was an [[indoor arena]] located in [[Denver]], [[Colorado]]. Located adjacent to [[Mile High Stadium]] and completed in 1975, at a cost of $16 million, it seated 16,061 for [[ice hockey|hockey]] games, 17,171 for [[basketball]] games and contained 27 luxury suites, which were installed as part of a 1986 renovation. It was named after Denver mayor [[William H. McNichols, Jr.]], who served from 1968 to 1983. A small-scale scandal surrounded the naming, because McNichols was in office at the time.  The 1986 renovations also saw the original [[Stewart-Warner]] end-zone scoreboards, which each had color matrix screens, upgraded by White Way Sign with new digits and to include new color video screens (which replaced the matrix screens).

The arena closed after the Nuggets and Avalanche moved to [[Pepsi Center]] and was demolished in 2000 to make space for a parking lot surrounding [[Broncos Stadium at Mile High]].

==Sports use==
McNichols Sports Arena was the home of the [[Denver Nuggets]] of the [[American Basketball Association|ABA]] and [[National Basketball Association|NBA]] for its entire existence from 1975 to 1999 It also hosted multiple hockey teams, including the [[Denver Spurs]] of the [[World Hockey Association|WHA]] during the 1975–76 season, the [[Colorado Rockies (NHL)|Colorado Rockies]] of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] from 1976 to 1982, the [[Colorado Flames]] of the [[Central Hockey League (1963–84)|CHL]] from 1982 to 1984, the Denver Grizzlies of the International Hockey League from 1994 to 1995, and the [[Colorado Avalanche]] of the [[National Hockey League|NHL]] from 1995 to 1999.

McNichols hosted the [[NCAA Division I Men's Basketball Championship|NCAA Final Four]] in 1990, won by [[University of Nevada, Las Vegas|UNLV]] over [[Duke University]] and the West Regional Semifinal in 1996. It was also host to the 1976 ABA All-Star Game, in which the host Nuggets defeated the ABA All-Stars, games 1, 2, and 5 of the 1976 ABA finals, and the 1984 [[NBA All-Star Game]]. It also hosted games one and two of the [[Stanley Cup]] Finals in 1996, where the Colorado Avalanche defeated the [[Florida Panthers]] in four games to bring Denver its first major sports championship.

[[UFC 1]], the first event of the [[Ultimate Fighting Championship]], was held there in 1993.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sherdog.com/fightfinder/fightfinder.asp?search=yes&amp;EventID=7 Fight Finder – UFC 1 The Beginning Mixed Martial Arts Statistics&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080420182851/http://www.sherdog.com/fightfinder/fightfinder.asp?search=yes&amp;EventID=7 |date=2008-04-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another notable event at McNichols took place on December 13, 1983, when the Nuggets hosted the [[Detroit Pistons]] in a regular season contest. Nugget players [[Kiki Vandeweghe]] and [[Alex English]] scored 51 and 47 points respectively, while Piston [[Isiah Thomas]] also scored 47 points, with teammate [[John Long (basketball)|John Long]] scoring 41 in a 186-184 triple-overtime Detroit win over the Nuggets. The game, still to date, is the highest-scoring game in NBA history, and also holds the record for the most players to score 40 or more points in a single game. However, the game was not televised in the Denver area (instead being shown back to the Detroit market, via [[WKBD-TV]]) and was attended by just over 9,300 people. This game has since been broadcast on [[NBA TV]] and [[ESPN Classic]].

==Notable events==

The group [[Heart (band)|Heart]] performed their rendition of "Unchained Melody" at the arena in 1980.  "Unchained Melody" was included on their highly-successful double LP ''[[Greatest Hits/Live]]'' released November 1980.

[[The Grateful Dead]] made a stop here on their Fall Southwest Tour on October 9, 1977.

Rolling Stones guitarists Keith Richards and Ron Wood performed as The New Barbarians at the arena in 1979.

[[REO Speedwagon]]'s concert from 1981 was performed here, as [[MTV]]'s first ever live concert.

The arena played host to [[Amnesty International]]'s [[A Conspiracy of Hope]] Benefit Concert on June 8, 1986. The show was headlined by [[U2]] and [[Sting (musician)|Sting]] and also featured [[Bryan Adams]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[Lou Reed]], [[Joan Baez]] and [[The Neville Brothers]].

Parts of U2's half-live rockumentary ''[[Rattle and Hum]]'', came from two concerts filmed in the arena, on the third leg of the band's 1987 [[The Joshua Tree Tour|Joshua Tree Tour]], including Bono's famous "Fuck the revolution!" speech during "[[Sunday Bloody Sunday (song)|Sunday Bloody Sunday]]".&lt;ref&gt;''Rattle &amp; Hum, The Movie'', 1988&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jethro Tull (band)|Jethro Tull]] played the arena 1976–1980

[[Def Leppard]] recorded one of their shows here in February 1988 and released it as ''[[Live: In the Round, in Your Face]]''.

Pop star [[Michael Jackson]] performed 2 consecutive sold-out shows in front of 40,251 people during his [[Bad World Tour]] in March 23, 24 1988.

Pop star [[Prince (musician)|Prince]] made a stop here on July 3, 1986 while on his [[Parade Tour]].

The bonus tracks on [[Stevie Ray Vaughan]] &amp; [[Double Trouble (band)|Double Trouble]]'s album ''[[In Step]]'', including "The House is Rockin’" (Live), "Let Me Love You Baby" (Live), "Texas Flood" (Live), and "Life Without You" (Live) were recorded on November 29, 1989 at McNichols Sports Arena.

[[Phish]] performed and recorded their show, on November 17, 1997, which was later released as a live album, entitled ''[[Live Phish Volume 11]]''.

[[ZZ Top]] performed at the venue's final concert on September 12, 1999.  They were the first rock band to play the arena on August 27, 1975.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://extras.denverpost.com/scene/mcnichols0912.htm|title=Denver Entertainment: The Denver Post|author=|date=|website=extras.denverpost.com|accessdate=6 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Final years==
The Colorado Avalanche played their final game on June 1, 1999 during the playoffs versus the [[Dallas Stars]] and the NBA's Denver Nuggets played their last game on May 5, 1999 against the [[Houston Rockets]]. Though the arena was only 24 years old when it was demolished, like most arenas of the 1970s, it was narrow and dark in the concourse level corridors. In addition, the locker rooms and shower facilities were not updated to NBA and NHL standards. Also, the arena lacked enough luxury suites (27 compared to some newer arenas' 200 or more) and had no club seating. Combined, these factors effectively made McNichols Sports Arena obsolete.

The '''Old Recreation Ground''' was  a football stadium, located in [[Hanley, Staffordshire|Hanley]], [[Stoke-on-Trent]] and home to [[Port Vale F.C.|Port Vale]] for almost 40 years. The Rec had been Vale's home between 1913 and 1950 and was the sixth ground the club used.&lt;ref name="Port-Vale.co.uk"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.port-vale.co.uk/page/ValePark/0,,10381,00.html |title=Port-Vale.co.uk: Vale Park |accessdate=18 December 2008|work=Port-Vale.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure and facilities==
[[File:The Old Recreation Ground attendances.JPG|thumb|right|400px|Average attendances, 1913–[[1949–50 Port Vale F.C. season|1950]].]]

The stadium was in rather bad condition, especially following years of neglect during [[World War II]]. The dressing rooms were bare, there were no toilet facilities throughout the entire ground, and [[Racing Homer|racing pigeon]]s were kept by ''[[The Sentinel (Staffordshire)|The Sentinel]]'' and a number of supporters so as to relay the scoreline to different parts of the city.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kent|first=Jeff|title=Port Vale Tales: A Collection Of Stories, Anecdotes And Memories|publisher=Witan Books|date=December 1991|pages=274|isbn=0-9508981-6-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[Port Vale F.C.]] opened the ground in 1913, and six years later were admitted into the [[English Football League]]. The visit of [[Potteries derby]] rivals [[Stoke City F.C.|Stoke]] on 6 March 1920 saw a crowd of 22,697 turn up to see an away victory.&lt;ref name="rdd"/&gt; Other big matches for Port Vale went more favourably in later years though, as they drew 2–2 with [[Arsenal F.C.|Arsenal]] in the [[FA Cup]] on 29 January 1927 and beat [[Sunderland A.F.C.|Sunderland]] 2–0 on 13 January 1936, again in the FA Cup.&lt;ref name="rdd"/&gt;

Ironically the club raised £50,000 to construct the new stadium, leading some to question why the directors did not simply attempt to raise a relatively much smaller sum of £3,000 in order to pay off the Huntbach family.&lt;ref name="if"&gt;''What If There Had Been No Port In The Vale?: Startling Port Vale Stories!''

[[File:Pitch invader at Red Sox vs Orioles, 2011-09-27.jpg|thumb|right|A police officer tackles a lone pitch invader at a 2011 [[Baltimore Orioles]] game.]]

A '''pitch invasion''', known as '''rushing the field''' or '''storming the field''' in North America, occurs when an individual or a crowd of people watching a sporting event run onto the playing area to celebrate or protest an incident. Pitch invasions may involve individual people or capacity crowds. Charges can be laid, resulting in fines or jail time.

This is especially common in [[college football|college]] and [[high school football]] when a team pulls off a major upset, defeats a major rival, ends a long [[losing streak]] or notches a history-making win.  Many schools employ [[riot police]] to physically prevent fans from rushing the field, a controversy in and of itself. However, with the widespread advent of artificial turf, some schools are becoming more lax about students invading the pitch. In the last few years, goal posts are also taken down within moments of the end of the game as a cautionary measure to prevent fans from climbing atop them to cause damage to the standard holding them up, damage to television camera equipment on the posts, and spectator injury. In the [[National Football League]], storming the field usually results in lifetime revocation of [[season ticket]]s from the holder of them, even if given or sold to another person.

* [[Chicago College All-Star Game]] (23 July 1976). With 1:22 remaining in the third quarter, the [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] led the College All-Stars 24–0 when a torrential rainstorm hit the field which made play impossible. After officials called for a delay, drunk and unruly fans invaded the pitch and tore down the goalposts. Officials, security, and police attempted to clear the field, but twelve minutes later, [[National Football League|NFL]] Commissioner [[Pete Rozelle]] and the sponsoring [[Chicago Tribune]] announced that the game had been called, which was greeted with jeers, and numerous brawls broke out on the flooded field before order was finally restored.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mmbolding.com/BSR/The_Chicago_All-Star_Game_1976.htm|title=Unconfigured Site|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2016|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160303222932/http://www.mmbolding.com/BSR/The_Chicago_All-Star_Game_1976.htm|archivedate=3 March 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Muscatine High School]] (8 September 1978). A [[high school football]] example of fans celebrating the end of a long losing streak—the Muskies had lost 44 consecutive games from 1973 to 1977, including 40 straight league games in the [[Mississippi Valley Conference (Iowa)|Mississippi Valley Conference]]. Optimism was high that the Muskies, now members of the newly formed [[Mississippi Athletic Conference|Mississippi Eight Conference]], would end their five-year-long losing streak sometime during the 1978 season, but it was in the season opener on the road against Ottumwa that Muscatine won their first game since the 1973 season opener. A touchdown with just over a minute left and a two-point conversion put Muscatine ahead with a 15-12 lead. Ottumwa advanced the ball to the Muskie 33-yard line on the ensuing series but was intercepted in the Muskie end zone with 2 seconds left. As soon as time expired more than 1,000 Muskie fans rushed the field to celebrate its first win in 45 contests; an attempt to tear down the goal posts was not successful.&lt;ref&gt;Bates, Roger, "Thank God it's over!" ''[[Muscatine Journal]]'', 9 September 1978.&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Buffalo Bills]] v [[Miami Dolphins]] (7 September 1980; NFL). The Bills broke a 20-game losing streak against their division rival Dolphins on this day, prompting the 79,000 fans in attendance at [[Rich Stadium]] to storm the field and tear down the stadium's goal posts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nfl.com/videos/buffalo-bills/09000d5d8208e8a1/Bills-stop-skid-vs-Dolphins|title=Bills stop skid vs. Dolphins|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* {{Cfb link|year=1982|team=California Golden Bears football|title=California}} v [[1982 Stanford Cardinal football team|Stanford]] (20 November 1982; [[Pac-12 Conference|Pacific-10]] [[American football|football]]).  In the final seconds of the 1982 [[Big Game (football)|Big Game]] against the [[University of California, Berkeley]] (Cal), [[Stanford Band]] members and Stanford players ran out onto the field, thinking the game was over.  Cal players [[lateral pass|lateralled]] the kickoff back and forth, with Cal's Kevin Moen dodging through the band for a winning touchdown, which he ended by running over trombone player Gary Tyrrell in the end zone. "[[The Play (Stanford vs. California)|The Play]]" is celebrated by Cal fans and inspires the ire of many Stanford fans. To this day, it remains one of the most famous plays in American football history. (The game does not end until the last play ends, even if the game clock runs out of time while the last play is still in progress.  A penalty was called as a result of "The Play", but it was only because the spectators and band members had crowded onto the field while the game was in progress.)
* [[Philadelphia Stars (football)|Philadelphia Stars]] v [[Michigan Panthers]] (17 July 1983; [[United States Football League|USFL]] [[American football|football]]) [[1983 USFL Championship Game|USFL Championship Game]]. After dropping four out of five games to start their first season in the new league, Michigan acquired some NFL veterans to finish the year 12-6 and vaulted over the Oakland Invaders in the single-tier playoffs. In front of a crowd of 46,565 paid attendees at [[Mile High Stadium]] in [[Denver]], the Panthers' late drive for a touchdown moved victory out of reach for the Stars, beating them 24-22.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lopresti|first1=Mike|title=Panthers a mile high, take first USFL championship – on Newspapers.com|url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/4099652/panthers_a_mile_high_take_first_usfl/|accessdate=22 January 2016|work=The San Bernardino County Sun|agency=Gannet News Service|date=18 Jul 1983|ref=USFLchamp83GAN}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the neutral ground afforded by a Super Bowl-style championship where the venue selected in advance of the playoffs, several hundred Michigan fans stormed the field and congregated in the area of the south stands and south goal post. Fans briefly mounted the goal post, nearly breaking it down, and missiles, notably bottles, were hurled by fans at [[Denver Police Department|Denver Police]], who responded with [[K-9 (police)|K-9 enforcement]], mace and batons. In the melee, 12 people were arrested by police, half from Michigan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=18 July 1983|page=18|url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/?spot=4099652|accessdate=22 January 2016|work=The San Bernardino County Sun|agency=Associated Press|date=18 July 1983|ref=USFLchamp83AP}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky]] v [[2002 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]] (9 November 2002; [[Southeastern Conference|SEC]] [[American football|football]]). Kentucky looked as if they would pull off a home upset of the Tigers when they held a 30–27 lead with two seconds left and LSU with the ball at their own 26-yard line. As [[quarterback]] [[Marcus Randall]] heaved a [[Hail Mary pass]] downfield, fans rushed onto the edges of the field ready to celebrate Kentucky's victory. However, the pass was deflected off two Wildcat defenders and into the hands of LSU [[wide receiver]] [[Devery Henderson]], who was able to run into the [[end zone]] to cap a 33–30 win for LSU and leaving the fans on the field stunned at the turn of events. The play would come to be known as the [[Bluegrass Miracle]].  Five years later at the same stadium, Wildcats fans invaded the field after avenging the loss with a win, and the school was fined $50,000 for a third violation of the conference's policy prohibiting pitch invasions (see below).
*[[2008 Texas vs. Texas Tech football game|Texas Tech v Texas]] (2 November 2008). Texas Tech fans invaded the [[Jones AT&amp;T Stadium]] turf three times during the final moments of the game. The first happened after [[Michael Crabtree]] caught a touchdown pass from [[Graham Harrell]] with one second to go: overjoyed fans, thinking the game was over and the [[2008 Texas Tech Red Raiders football team|Red Raiders]] had upset [[2008 Texas Longhorns football team|#1-ranked Texas]], spilled out onto the field, doing so again after the replay official announced that Crabtree had indeed stayed inbounds the moment before crossing the goal line. Tech was assessed two unsportsmanlike conduct penalties for this, forcing them to kick off from the 7-and-a-half yard line. After the ball was recovered by Tech, the game ended and the fans stormed the field one final time without penalty.
* [[Kick Six|Auburn v Alabama]] (30 November 2013). [[2013 Auburn Tigers football team|Auburn University]] faced off against their arch-rivals, the [[2013 Alabama Crimson Tide football team|University of Alabama]] in their annual rivalry game, popularly known as the [[Iron Bowl]]. Alabama entered the season ranked #1 after winning two consecutive BCS National Championships. Auburn had begun the season unranked, but had moved up to #4 in the rankings, marking the second time both teams were ranked in the Top 5 of the BCS rankings. The winner of the game would earn the right to play in the [[2013 SEC Championship Game|SEC Championship Game]]. With one second left on the clock and the score tied, Alabama elected to attempt a 57-yard field goal. The kick was short and Auburn defender [[Chris Davis (cornerback)|Chris Davis]] fielded it 9 yards deep in his own end zone. He returned the kick all the way to the Alabama end zone, scoring the game-winning touchdown, in a play known as the [[Kick Six]].  In spite of the SEC's penalties for rushing the field, thousands of Auburn fans (mainly students) flooded the field in delight at earning a spot in the SEC Championship game, as well as ending arch-rival Alabama's [[College football national championships in NCAA Division I FBS|national title]] hopes. Following the game, the Auburn grounds crew discovered that amongst the debris left on the field was a pile of cremains on the Auburn sideline, assumed to be placed there by a fan honoring a deceased relation's request to have his ashes scattered on the field. (Traditionally sports teams rarely permit "burials" on their pitch in order to protect the health of the turf, and if so it is almost always an important club figure whose remains are scattered.)
===Southeastern Conference penalties===
Section 10.5 of the [[Southeastern Conference]] By-Laws has a progressive fine policy adopted in 2004 for major sports: $5,000 for the first offence, $25,000 for the second offence, and $50,000 for third and subsequent offences within a three-year period of the last pitch invasion. In May 2015, the fines increased to $50,000, $100,000, and $250,000 for the first, second, and third plus subsequent offences, respectively. The period for past violations was also increased from three years to five. 

The [[Kentucky Wildcats football|Kentucky Wildcats]] have been hit with "the triple" for three football pitch invasions within eleven months:
* On 4 November 2006, the team was fined $5,000 for a pitch invasion after a football win against [[2006 Georgia Bulldogs football team|Georgia]].
* On 15 September 2007, the team was fined $25,000 for a pitch invasion after a football non-conference win against [[Governor's Cup (Kentucky)|archrival]] [[2007 Louisville Cardinals football team|Louisville]].
* On 13 October 2007, the team was fined $50,000 for a pitch invasion after a triple overtime football win against top-ranked [[2007 LSU Tigers football team|LSU]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.secsports.com/news/?ArticleId=9813|title=SEC Football Clubhouse – Latest Headlines, Standings, Schedule, and Leaders|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Vanderbilt, South Carolina and Missouri have been fined $25,000 for second offence violations, but most SEC schools have been fined $5,000. Missouri's fine is notable in that their second violation occurred after only three years as a member of the SEC: both came when supporters flooded [[Faurot Field]] after the team clinched a trip to the [[SEC Championship Game]], in [[2013 Missouri Tigers football team|2013]] and [[2014 Missouri Tigers football team|2014]].  Note that in association football, Kentucky and South Carolina have the rule in effect for women's games, but because the men's game is held under the auspices of [[Conference USA]], there is no pitch invasion fine in that sport. {{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

[[Auburn Tigers|Auburn]] became the first SEC institution to be fined the maximum of $250,000 following its football victory over [[Alabama Crimson Tide|Alabama]] on 25 November 2017. This came on top of violations following Auburn victories over Alabama in football in [[Kick Six|2013]] and Kentucky in men's basketball in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.saturdaydownsouth.com/auburn-football/sec-fines-auburn-250000-rushing-field-iron-bowl-win/|title=SEC fines Auburn $250,000 for rushing field after Iron Bowl win|publisher=Saturday Down South|accessdate=25 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other conference penalties===
Other conferences have similar by-laws; in some conferences, the pitch invasion rule is reset to zero after five years without a pitch invasion, and the fine is doubled in the event that a player or official is injured as a result of the pitch invasion.

However, more recently, some conferences have begun cracking down on pitch invasions in all sports.

===Tearing down the goal posts===

There has long been a tradition in American football — primarily in college football — under which fans celebrating a major victory will tear down the goal posts on the field after the game.&lt;ref&gt;Darren Rovell, [http://espn.go.com/sportsbusiness/s/2002/1120/1463785.html The ultimate form of fan participation], ESPN.com (20 November 2002).

Retrieved 22 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

Tearing down the goal posts can be dangerous, however, as people can be injured or killed by a falling goal post.  Persons who sit or hang on the goal posts while they are being pulled down can be injured if they fall off or if they land hard on the ground when the goal posts collapse. Camera equipment from a game broadcaster attached to the goalposts results in another injury possibility.  These dangers can create legal implications for the schools, the localities, and the venues where the games occur.&lt;ref&gt;David LaVetter &amp; Yun Seok Choi, [http://quod.lib.umich.edu/cgi/p/pod/dod-idx/implications-of-toppling-goal-posts-in-college-football.pdf?c=jsas;idno=6776111.0002.107 Implications of Toppling Goal Posts in College Football: Managing Institutional Risk], ''Journal of Sport Administration &amp; Supervision'', Volume 2, Issue 1, April 2010.  Retrieved 21 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Massachusetts]], there is a state statute that specifically prohibits the unauthorized tearing down of goal posts on a football field.  Chapter 266, Section 104A of the [[General Laws of Massachusetts|Massachusetts General Laws]] provides: "Whoever willfully and without right destroys, injures or removes a goal post on a football field shall be punished by a fine of not less than fifty nor more than two hundred dollars."&lt;ref&gt;[https://malegislature.gov/Laws/GeneralLaws/PartIV/TitleI/Chapter266/Section104A Massachusetts General Laws, Chapter 266, Section 104A], from the website of the [[Massachusetts General Court|Massachusetts state legislature]].

Retrieved 21 April 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;  On 26 November 1959 (Thanksgiving Day that year), a 14-year-old girl in [[Foxborough]], Jane Puffer, was hit on the head by a falling goal post.  She had been part of a crowd that was on the field after the conclusion of a high school football game while a group of fans was tearing down a goal post.  The steel goal post suddenly toppled to the ground, and Puffer was hit as she was apparently trying to push another girl out of its way.  She died of her injuries the next day.&lt;ref&gt;[[Associated Press]], [https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=2209&amp;dat=19591127&amp;id=Oa4rAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=t_0FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4384,2511083&amp;hl=en "Goal Post Kills Girl"], reprinted in the ''[[Nashua Telegraph]]'', page 1 (27 November 1959), and "Girl, 14, Near Death After Blow from Falling Goal Post", on page 3 of the same edition of the newspaper.

In spite of the law, on 22 December 1985, fans of the [[New England Patriots]] tore down a goal post in [[Sullivan Stadium]] (also in Foxborough) to celebrate the team's victory there in the regular season finale against the [[Cincinnati Bengals]], which clinched a playoff berth for the Patriots.  Some fans carried the goal post outside of the stadium, where they caused it to come into contact with an overhead high-voltage power line.  A man nearby, Jon Pallazola, was seriously injured.  There was evidence that he was injured when he tried to protect himself from being hit by the falling goal post immediately after it became electrified.  Pallazola subsequently sued a private security company that had been under contract to provide security at the stadium.  He received a large jury verdict against the company, and then settled his claim against the company for $4.5 million.  He also sued the Town of Foxborough but, in 1994, the [[Massachusetts Supreme Judicial Court]] ruled that his claim against the town was barred by a state statute that gave municipalities immunity from claims that they failed to provide police protection or prevent crimes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://scholar.google.com/scholar_case?q=640+N.E.2d+460&amp;hl=en&amp;as_sdt=20000006&amp;case=2218433522576570264&amp;scilh=0 Pallazola v.

He also filed a [[product liability]] lawsuit against the manufacturer of the goal post, contending that the goal post was "defective and unreasonably dangerous."

Pitch invasions are not uncommon but not as frequent nowadays in top level football, but historically it was common for the supporters of the winning team in a major match, such as a Cup Final, to flood onto the pitch after the final whistle. For example, in [[Kenneth Wolstenholme]]'s famous "Some people are on the pitch, [[they think it's all over]] – it is now!" comment on the BBC's television coverage of the [[1966 World Cup Final]]. "They" were fans who had encroached onto the pitch before the end of [[overtime (sports)|extra time]].

Pitch invasions became less common after the 1970s and 1980s. Counterintuitively, in that period that fans were barricaded in the stands by fences yet invasions were common; after the [[Hillsborough disaster]] in 1989, the barricading form of supposed crowd control was abandoned and pitch invasions became rarer. The decline may partly be due to the fact that in 1991 pitch invasions were criminalised in the UK under the Football Offences Act.&lt;ref name="FootballOffencesAct001"&gt;

  | accessdate = 2013-12-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they do still occur, especially in the lower divisions where there is less policing and security.

Famous pitch invasions include:
* [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] v [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] (17 April 1909) [[1909 Scottish Cup Final|Scottish Cup final replay]]. At the end of the drawn replay, the crowd invaded the pitch to protest at the lack of a result and at the prospect of having to pay to watch a third game. The SFA withheld the Cup.
* [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] v [[Sheffield Wednesday F.C.|Sheffield Wednesday]] (14 May 1966) [[1966 FA Cup Final|FA Cup final]]. Sheffield Wednesday had scored two goals while Everton had a goal disqualified as offside before Everton scored two goals in the second half to equalise. Shortly after the equalising goal Everton fan Eddie Canavagh invaded the pitch, eluding one police officer before being tackled and escorted off the pitch by a second officer. Everton went on to win the game 3-2. 
* [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] v [[Inter Milan]] (25 May 1967) [[1967 European Cup Final|European Cup final]]. As the final whistle blew, fans of Celtic flooded the pitch in jubilation as Celtic became the first British team to lift the European Cup.
* [[Hereford United F.C.|Hereford United]] v [[Newcastle United F.C.|Newcastle United]] (5 February 1972) [[FA Cup]]. [[Hereford United 2–1 Newcastle United|Non-league Hereford beat top-flight Newcastle 2–1 after extra time]]. There were pitch invasions after both Hereford goals and one at the end of the match.
* [[Manchester United]] v [[Manchester City]] (27 April 1974) [[1973-74 Football League#First Division|Football League First Division]]. There were pitch invasions a few minutes after [[Denis Law]] scored the only goal for the visiting team, in a match that would have given United hope of staying in the old First Division had they won as it was the second to last game of the season. Although United's fate was not sealed with that goal, the pitch invasion confirmed it as the match was abandoned 8 minutes before playing time had expired, along with negative results elsewhere.  
* [[England national football team|England]] v [[Scotland national football team|Scotland]] (4 June 1977) [[British Home Championship|Home International]]. Scotland won 2–1 with goals from [[Gordon McQueen]] and [[Kenny Dalglish]] in the match played at the [[Wembley Stadium (1923)|old Wembley]]. At the final whistle, Scotland supporters invaded the pitch and destroyed one of the goals. The scenes were broadcast live on UK TV, and this is identified as one of the key moments when [[football hooliganism]] caught the interest of politicians.
* [[Celtic F.C.|Celtic]] v [[Rangers F.C.|Rangers]] (10 May 1980) [[1980 Scottish Cup Final|Scottish Cup final]]. Celtic beat Rangers 1–0 during extra time and rioting ensued on the pitch at full-time. Mounted police had to break up the battling fans; this also led to the banning of alcohol from Scottish football grounds.
* [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] v [[Fulham F.C.|Fulham]] (14 May 1983) [[1982-83 Football League#Second Division|Football League Second Division]]. This match was controversially never concluded after Derby fans invaded the pitch. Fulham required a win to be promoted back into the top flight of English football but despite their protests the match was never replayed and the result, a 1–0 defeat, stood.
* [[Everton F.C.|Everton]] v [[Wimbledon F.C.|Wimbledon]] (7 May 1994). In an attempt to secure 40 consecutive years of top-flight football, Everton, who had been at the foot of the table for much of a dreadful season, needed to beat the in-form Wimbledon, who had not lost for 10 games in a row. The club's chairman had offered a trip to Las Vegas if they should make it 11. Despite one stand being closed due to construction the atmosphere was known as one of the greatest ever within Goodison Park. Although they went 2–0 down in the first 20 minutes, Everton managed a remarkable comeback to win the game 3–2 and secure survival. A mass pitch invasion ensued and many images of the emotional day were screened on the BBC's ''[[Grandstand (BBC)|Grandstand]]''.
* [[Carlisle United]] v [[Plymouth Argyle]] (8 May 1999). Having been bottom of the table for much of the season, Carlisle United needed a win to stand any chance of possible survival and retain their Football League status. With the score at 1-1 against Plymouth in injury time, on-loan goalkeeper [[Jimmy Glass]] came forward from his own half into the opposition box for the subsequent Carlisle corner kick. The ball met Glass on a rebound shot and he kicked into the net to score, winning the match and condemning [[Scarborough F.C.|Scarborough]] to relegation in the process. A mass pitch invasion took place before the match ended.
* [[FC Schalke 04|Schalke]] v [[SpVgg Unterhaching|Unterhaching]] (19 May 2001). Before the last round of matches of the [[2000–01 Fußball-Bundesliga|Bundesliga 2000–01 season]], Bayern Munich led Schalke 04 by three points, but with an inferior goal difference. Schalke managed to defeat Unterhaching 5–3 in their final match at the [[Parkstadion]]. Shortly before this match ended, Bayern gave up a 90th-minute goal against Hamburg. Most Schalke supporters believed their team had won their first championship since 1958. The pitch had thus been stormed in celebration although the match in Hamburg was not concluded yet. In Hamburg, an indirect free kick was awarded for Bayern and Patrik Andersson eventually scored the decisive equaliser. In Schalke, the atmosphere immediately turned from joy and celebration to shock, disbelief and mourning.
* [[Aston Villa]] v [[Manchester United]] (6 January 2002) [[FA Cup]]. Manchester United were 2–0 down with 15 minutes left of play; however, Manchester United scored three times in 5 minutes and their third goal caused many Manchester United fans to invade the pitch in celebration.
* [[Watford F.C.|Watford]] v [[Luton Town]] (10 September 2002). 10 minutes before the [[EFL Cup|Football League Cup]] game kicked off, Luton fans invaded the pitch, provoking the Watford fans to do the same. A mass brawl on the pitch ensued between the two sets and the game was delayed for 25 minutes before [[riot police]] regained order.&lt;ref name="BBC2249877"&gt;

* [[Queens Park Rangers]] v [[Crewe Alexandra F.C.|Crewe Alexandra]] (26 April 2003) [[Football League Division 2]]. QPR needed to win this game to pip Crewe of automatic promotion from Division 2. During the game there was a nasty coin throwing incident, and a QPR fan went onto the pitch to remonstrate with the [[referee (association football)|referee]]. The game finished 0–0, meaning Crewe were promoted, and hundreds of QPR fans invaded the pitch.&lt;ref name="BBCSport001"&gt;

* [[West Bromwich Albion F.C.|West Bromwich Albion]] v [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] (15 May 2005) [[FA Premier League]]. West Brom defeated Portsmouth 2–0; combined with other results, this completed one of the most amazing [[FA Premier League 2004-05#The relegation dog fight|escapes from relegation]] in English football history. West Brom became the first team since the advent of the modern [[FA Premier League|Premiership]] in 1992–93 to escape relegation after being bottom of the table at Christmas. Once all results came in and West Brom were secure, thousands of Baggies fans at [[The Hawthorns]] ecstatically ran onto the pitch. Many Portsmouth fans joined the celebrations, as one of the teams relegated at West Brom's expense were their arch-rivals [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]].
* [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] v [[Derby County F.C.|Derby County]] (1 April 2006) [[Football League Championship]]. Reading defeated Derby County 5–0 to secure the [[Football League Championship]] title. In the previous game [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] drew 1–1 with [[Leicester City F.C.|Leicester City]] at the [[Walkers Stadium]] to secure promotion to the [[FA Premier League]] for their first season in the top flight during their 135-year history. At the end of the game [[Reading F.C.|Reading]] fans spilled onto the pitch to celebrate these two achievements.
* [[Wigan Athletic]] v [[Portsmouth F.C.|Portsmouth]] (29 April 2006) [[FA Premier League]]. Portsmouth defeated [[Wigan Athletic|Wigan]] 2-1 to ensure Portsmouth's survival in the [[FA Premier League]]. Nicknamed "the Great Escape" by Portsmouth fans, this win marked the conclusion to an astonishing series of matches under their manager [[Harry Redknapp]] who had rejoined the club earlier in the year, after being sacked by fierce rivals [[Southampton F.C.|Southampton]], when Portsmouth were in a deep relegation crisis. It heralded the arrival of Portsmouth's new owner, [[Sacha Gaydamak]], who bankrolled the signings made by [[Harry Redknapp]] during the January transfer window. Portsmouth fans invaded the pitch at the [[DW Stadium]] in jubilation and relief at staying up. This marked the beginning of the saga leading to Portsmouth's relegation and bankruptcy.
* [[West Ham United F.C.|West Ham United]] v [[Millwall F.C.|Millwall]] (25 August 2009) [[Football League Cup]]. After West Ham equalised, fans invaded the pitch but did not cause a major disturbance. After West Ham scored twice more, hundreds of their fans invaded the pitch and riot police were hastily deployed. It took over six minutes for the police to clear the pitch. Sports Minister [[Gerry Sutcliffe]] was quoted as saying that the violence between West Ham and Millwall was "a disgrace to football" and the invasions were widely condemned by the FA and the players.&lt;ref name="Telegraph6093066"&gt;

Russian feminist rock band and protest group [[Pussy Riot]] claimed responsibility for the interruption.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Nyren |first=Erin |date=15 July 2018 |title=Pussy Riot Claims Responsibility for People Running Onto Field During World Cup |url=https://variety.com/2018/biz/news/pussy-riot-world-cup-people-running-onto-field-1202873620/ |work=[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]] |accessdate=15 July 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australian rules football==
[[File:Kick-to-kick.jpg|thumb|200px|A post-game kick-to-kick match is a rare sight. This follows an AFL match between the [[Melbourne Football Club|Melbourne Demons]] and [[Port Adelaide Football Club|Port Adelaide Power]] at the Melbourne Cricket Ground. 16000 fans were let onto the turf.]]
[[File:Lance 'Buddy' Franklin bringing up his 100th goal for the 2008 season.jpg|thumb|200px|This pitch invasion occurred when [[Lance Franklin]] scored his 100th goal of the season in the final round of the [[2008 AFL season|regular AFL season]].]]
Pitch invasions, hostile and violent, have long been a tradition of [[Australian rules football]]. At the end of an Australian rules match, it is traditional for supporters to run onto the field to celebrate the game and play games of [[kick-to-kick]] with their families. Supporters were once also able to do this during the half-time break. In recent years, this was subject to stricter controls, and then finally banned altogether, in the elite [[Australian Football League]]. However, it is still common in suburban and state football leagues like the [[Victorian Football League]].

It is also a tradition for football fans to engage in a ''mid-match'' pitch invasion when a player reaches a landmark achievement, typically a 100th goal in a season, a 1000th career goal, or in the case of [[Tony Lockett]]'s 1300th career goal in 1999, breaking the all-time goal-kicking record. The AFL has not yet succeeded in preventing these mid-match invasions, but players are duly protected by [[bodyguard]]s and stadium security while supporters flood onto the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Lance Franklin kicks his 100th goal|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C6cTjUjabw4|website=YouTube|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buddy Franklins 100th Goal|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5FZrOJ4wIFM|website=YouTube|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Buddy Franklin kicks his 100th goal|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Be_Qski_zds|website=YouTube|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There have been a few occasions of hostile pitch invasions; the most infamous of these occurred in the [[1967 Tasmanian State Premiership Final]], when hundreds of Wynyard fans invaded the field and tore down the goalposts to prevent North Hobart full forward David Collins from kicking a goal after the final siren.  The Tasmanian Football League declared the match a ''no result'' and withheld the 1967 State Premiership.

Another hostile pitch invasion occurred in an AFL night game between [[St Kilda Football Club|St Kilda]] and [[Essendon Football Club|Essendon]] in 1996, when the floodlights at [[Waverley Park]] lost power during the third quarter and fans rioted in the darkness and, coincidentally, also took down the goalposts. (The final quarter of the game was played three days later.){{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Some unusual pitch invasions have become part of football folklore, such as the famous incident of the pig named "Plugger" being let loose on the ground in round 18, 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.smh.com.au/news/afl/the-day-a-pitchinvading-porker-made-plugger-feel-pig-sick/2006/07/14/1152637868464.html|title=The day a pitch-invading porker made Plugger feel pig sick – AFL – Sport|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Similar incidents of animals invading the pitch have also occurred in recent years, including a feral cat which was arrested at [[Football Park|AAMI Stadium]], as well as occasional dogs. The outlawed practice of "[[streaking]]" (running naked onto the ground) occurred in some big matches, most famously the performance of Helen d'Amico in the [[1982 VFL Grand Final]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Naked Streaker – 1982 VFL Grand Final|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=3FYMUSdVbpQ|website=YouTube|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Female streaker's big change|url=http://www.news.com.au/national/female-streakers-big-change/story-e6frfkp9-1111116079340|website=news.com.au|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Frozen In Time: Helen D'Amico wows Richmond-Carlton fans at the 1982 Grand Final|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/sport/afl/frozen-in-time-helen-damico-wows-richmond-carlton-fans-at-the-1982-grand-final/story-fni5f22o-1226726977997|website=Herald Sun|publisher=News Corporation|accessdate=19 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Baseball==
[[File:BlueJaysPitchInvasion 02.JPG|thumb|Field intrusion at [[Toronto Blue Jays|Blue Jays]] baseball game]]
In modern [[major league baseball|baseball]], intruding or storming the field is typically undertaken by one or a small number of [[attention seeking]] fans or pranksters, rather than a large number of people although more-generalized riots have occurred.  Almost universally, the intruder(s) will be [[ejection (sports)|ejected]] from the [[baseball park|ballpark]] and potentially banned for life from it, and may also face [[criminal charges]] depending on the nature of the offence.

In cases when a game is broadcast on television and a person or small group runs onto the field, the broadcaster will cut to another camera shot elsewhere in the stadium, to the [[play-by-play announcer|commentators]] in the press box, or to a commercial break instead of focusing on the person(s); this is to avoid giving attention to their behavior, and to discourage imitators who might try the same thing (and as, occasionally, the person is also a [[streaking|streaker]], to avoid showing nudity).

===Famous incidents===
* [[New York Yankees]] at [[Washington Senators (1961–71)|Washington Senators]] (30 September 1971; [[American League]]). With the Senators preparing to move [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|to the Dallas area]] the following season, thousands of non-paying spectators entered [[RFK Stadium]] for the Senators' final home game after security left mid-game.  In the top of the ninth inning, with two out and the Senators leading 7-5, several hundred fans ran onto the field, tearing up the turf and stealing bases for souvenirs.  Without security, order could not be restored, and the game was [[Forfeit (baseball)|forfeited]] to the Yankees.
* [[Texas Rangers (baseball)|Texas Rangers]] at [[Cleveland Indians]] (4 June 1974; American League). In an effort to increase attendance, the Indians arranged a "[[Ten Cent Beer Night]]" promotion, drawing over 25,000 fans—three times their normal home crowd.  The game itself was plagued by sporadic pitch invasions and objects thrown into the field by inebriated fans.  In the ninth inning, a scuffle between an intruder and Texas outfielder [[Jeff Burroughs]] ended with a riot involving thousands of fans and both teams, and the Indians were forfeited.
* [[Chicago Cubs]] v [[Los Angeles Dodgers]] (25 April 1976; [[National League]]). Two protesters, William Thomas and his 11-year-old son, ran into the outfield at [[Dodger Stadium]] and tried to [[flag desecration|set fire]] to an [[Flag of the United States|American flag]] they had brought with them. Chicago outfielder [[Rick Monday]] noticed they had placed the flag on the ground and were fumbling with matches and lighter fluid; he then dashed over and grabbed the flag from the ground to thunderous cheers. He handed the flag to Los Angeles pitcher [[Doug Rau]], after which the ballpark police officers arrested the two intruders. When he came up to bat in the next half-inning, he got a standing ovation from the Los Angeles crowd and the big message board behind the left-field bleachers in the stadium flashed the message, "RICK MONDAY... YOU MADE A GREAT PLAY..." He later said, "If you're going to burn the flag, don't do it around me. I've been to too many veterans' hospitals and seen too many broken bodies of guys who tried to protect it."&lt;ref name=flag&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060424&amp;content_id=1415977&amp;vkey=news_chc&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=chc |title=Monday's act heroic after 30 years |publisher=Cubs at MLB.com |first=Ben |last=Platt |date=25 April 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070204001843/http://chicago.cubs.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20060424&amp;content_id=1415977&amp;vkey=news_chc&amp;fext=.jsp&amp;c_id=chc |archivedate=4 February 2007 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 25 August 2008, Monday was presented with an American flag flown over Valley Forge National Historical Park in honor of his 1976 rescue.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|first=Kathy |last=Boccella |title=Player who saved flag from desecration honored |date=26 August 2008 |work=[[Philadelphia Inquirer]] |url =http://www.philly.com/philly/news/27422784.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009023918/http://www.philly.com/philly/news/27422784.html |archivedate=9 October 2008 | accessdate=2012-03-17 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Kansas City Royals]] at [[New York Yankees]] (14 October 1976; [[1976 American League Championship Series|American League Championship Series]]). [[Chris Chambliss]] hit a [[walk-off home run]] in game five of the series to send the Yankees to their first [[World Series]] in twelve years, and fans rushed onto the field while Chambliss circled the bases. The scene was so frenetic that Chambliss himself wasn't even sure he touched home plate in the chaos, and after being asked about this by third baseman [[Graig Nettles]], had to be escorted back onto the field by police after fans had left to step on home plate in view of home plate [[Umpire (baseball)|umpire]] [[Art Frantz]].
* [[Detroit Tigers]] at [[Chicago White Sox]] (12 July 1979; American League). In a promotion famously known as [[Disco Demolition Night]] fans were invited to bring [[disco]] records with them to [[Comiskey Park]]. The records would then be destroyed in between games of a [[Doubleheader (baseball)|doubleheader]]. Fans were so caught up in the anti-disco mania that fans stormed the field and a near-riot broke out. The second game had to be cancelled and was eventually [[forfeit (baseball)|forfeited]] by the White Sox.

===Morganna, the Kissing Bandit===
[[Morganna|Morganna, the Kissing Bandit]] became famous for rushing the field in baseball and other sports from the early 1970s through the 1980s. She rushed the field on numerous occasions and kissed many [[Major League Baseball]] players including [[Nolan Ryan]], [[Pete Rose]], [[Johnny Bench]], [[George Brett]] (twice), [[Steve Garvey]], and [[Cal Ripken, Jr.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news| url = http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2004/pr/subs/siexclusive/07/09/flashback.morganna/ | title = Where Are They Now?

==Basketball==
College basketball has a similar phenomenon, known as "'''storming the court'''". This normally happens for the same reasons as storming the field in college football.

In high school and some colleges, walking on the court is the only way to exit from the stands. However, there are usually officials and security personnel that limit how far spectators can walk onto the court, at least while players and game officials are still leaving the court.

===Incidents===
The [[2011–12 Indiana Hoosiers men's basketball team|Indiana University]] men's basketball team defeated the [[2011–12 Kentucky Wildcats men's basketball team|#1 ranked Kentucky Wildcats]] 73-72 on 10 December 2011, after a three-point shot by [[Christian Watford]] with no time left on the clock. Fans at Indiana's [[Simon Skjodt Assembly Hall|Assembly Hall]] filled the court within seconds to create a series of iconic images. ESPN commentator [[Dick Vitale]], who was covering the game for the network, said it was the "best game of the year"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Q &amp; A: Dick Vitale's enthusiasm for NCAA tournament is contagious|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2012/mar/13/sports/la-sp-0314-dick-vitale-qa-20120314|accessdate=22 March 2012|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=13 March 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and that "[t]he atmosphere there was unreal, as I felt the building shaking after Watford hit the shot."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Vitale|first=Dick|title=Indiana basketball back on the map|url=http://espn.go.com/espn/dickvitale/story/_/id/7344694/indiana-hoosiers-basketball-back-big-way|accessdate=22 March 2012|newspaper=ESPN|date=12 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Watford's shot won an [[ESPY Award]] for [[Best Play ESPY Award|Best Play]]. Kentucky avenged their loss on their way to a National Championship later that season by defeating Indiana 102-90 during the Sweet Sixteen round of the [[2012 NCAA Men's Division I Basketball Tournament]].

Hundreds of students from [[2015–16 Iowa State Cyclones men's basketball team|Iowa State University]] stormed the court after the No. 4-ranked Cyclones' 83-82 [[comeback (sports)|come-from-behind]] victory over in-state rival [[2015–16 Iowa Hawkeyes men's basketball team|Iowa]] 11 December 2015, at [[Hilton Coliseum]] in [[Ames, Iowa]]. In the aftermath, ''[[Des Moines Register]]'' sports columnist Randy Peterson suffered a leg fracture.&lt;ref&gt;"Peterson breaks leg in court-storming incident", ''[[Des Moines Register]]'', December 11, 2015. Accessed 12-11-2015.

That's a great moment. Those college kids ... they've been camping out here (for tickets) for three days. There's only probably 10 schools that do that in the country. Give them their 15 or 20 minutes to do that. I thought it was pretty cool."&lt;ref&gt;"Injured Register columnist: 'I was not trampled'", ''[[Des Moines Register]]'', December 11, 2015. Accessed 12-11-2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===High schools===
Although not as well publicized as college incidents, fans storming the court after a big win is not uncommon at the high school level. The injuries suffered by several people following the Iowa State University men's basketball team's win over the University of Iowa in December 2015 prompted the [[Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union]] to issue a memorandum to athletic directors and coaches to remind fans that the organization and its sister organization, the Iowa High School Athletic Association, have policies prohibiting court storming after post-season games. "I have to wonder if the person injured was the star player, the coach, or one of the game officials if the attitude and need for 'storming the court' might change?" wrote IGHSAU executive director Mike Dick.&lt;ref&gt;Eslinger, Jason, "A Note from the Executive Director: Storming the Court: Don’t Do It!" [[Iowa Girls High School Athletic Union]], December 18, 2015. Accessed 12-29-2015. [http://ighsau.org/2015/12/18/a-note-from-the-executive-director-storming-the-court-dont-do-it/]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cricket==
{{See also|Sydney Riot of 1879}}
It used to be a common occurrence at the end of [[cricket]] [[Test cricket|Test matches]] for the crowd to invade the pitch to watch the presentation from the pavilion balcony. In the UK, this tradition ended in 2001 after a steward was injured in a pitch invasion at a [[one-day cricket|one-day match]] between England and Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/1393761.stm | work=BBC News | title=Steward hurt in cricket chaos | date=17 June 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Invading the pitch can now warrant a £1,000 fine and a lifetime ban from the ground. Post-match presentations are now held on the field or in a room within the venue restricted from public access and displayed on a video [[scoreboard]] if available.

In August 1975, vandals protesting the imprisonment of alleged armed robber [[George Davis (armed robber)|George Davis]] invaded the pitch of the [[Headingley Cricket Ground]] before the final day of the [[Australian cricket team in England in 1975|Third Ashes Test]] between England and Australia, digging holes in the field and covering one end of the pitch in oil. This led to the first-ever declaration of a Test ground being unfit for play, resulting in the match being abandoned and declared a draw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/onthisday/hi/dates/stories/august/19/newsid_2534000/2534763.stm|title=1975: Davis campaigners stop Test match|publisher=[[BBC]]|date=19 Aug 1975}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/216592.html|title=Vandals stopped play|publisher=ESPNcricinfo|date=12 Aug 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was significant as it denied England a chance to tie the series and potentially retain the Ashes; Australia eventually took back the Ashes.

In 1982, a pitch invasion at the [[WACA Ground|WACA]] led to Australian bowler [[Terry Alderman]] suffering a shoulder injury when attempting to apprehend one of the intruders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.espncricinfo.com/magazine/content/story/341460.html|title=A costly tackle|publisher=|accessdate=14 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two One Day International matches at the [[Bourda]] ground in [[Georgetown, Guyana]] have had their results disrupted by pitch invasions. In 1993, the crowd invaded on the last ball of a match as the West Indies ran a second run to tie the score against Pakistan; then, in 1999, the crowd invaded on the last ball of a match as Australia ran a third run to tie the score against the West Indies. In both cases, the fielding team had been a chance of effecting a run-out to prevent the tying run, had the crowd not invaded; but in both cases, match referee [[Raman Subba Row]] declared the match to be [[tie (cricket)|tied]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/default.aspx?pageid=438&amp;n=aussie-may-calls-for-better-security-measures-1999-04-23|title=Aussie May calls for better security measures|date=23 April 1999|accessdate=3 March 2012|newspaper=Hurriyet Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gaelic football and hurling==
In [[Gaelic football]] and [[hurling]], both national sports of Ireland, pitch invasions were acceptable and most widely seen at [[Provincial championships|Provincial]] and [[All-Ireland Final (disambiguation)|All-Ireland Final]]s. However, there has only been one occurrence at [[Croke Park]], after the [[2010 Leinster Senior Football Championship Final]], due to a crackdown since 2009 by the [[Gaelic Athletic Association|GAA]], though they still occur in other stadia around the country.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==International rules football==
[[International rules football]], a hybrid of Aussie Rules and [[Gaelic football]] is not known for pitch invasions; however, a famous one occurred in the first test of the [[2006 International Rules Series]] at [[Pearse Stadium]], [[Galway]] after Ireland defeated Australia.

The game included several impersonators and streakers, but at the end of the game, when Ireland had come from behind to win with goals in the dying seconds of the match, the crowd rushed the field, causing much controversy with the Australian players.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Rugby league==
In [[New South Wales Rugby League]] matches up until the 1980s, spectators often took to the field on the completion of the match within seconds after the final siren. This required the players to navigate through a crowd of people when coming off the field, and the cardboard corner posts were usually taken as "souvenirs".{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

This practice was discouraged when the publicly viewable game clock stopped with five minutes to play in order to ensure that spectators, not knowing when the game was about to finish, could not jump the gun and enter the playing arena with the game unfinished. Eventually the tradition died out, and spectators rarely, if ever, take the field in the present day [[National Rugby League]]; fines of $7000 and lifetime bans exist for those who do so.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

In 2007, a match between [[Hull Kingston Rovers]] and [[Hull F.C.|Hull FC]] at [[Craven Park, Hull|Craven Park]] also known as the 'Hull Derby', the match ended at a score off 30 – 20 in favour of Hull FC. After the final whistle Hull FC fans raided the pitch to congratulate their players. The same happened in 2015 after Hull beat Rovers 22-12 which secured them a play-off spot{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

==Rugby union==
Pitch invasions have occurred throughout the history of [[rugby union]], with some particular moments being the most infamous. In the past, additional security support has been constructed at stadiums due to foreseen trouble. An early example of this was at the [[1924 Summer Olympics]], when a wire fence was constructed to protect United States players.{{citation needed|date=May 2013}}

===Infamous pitch invasions===
* During the [[1971 Springbok tour]], hundreds were arrested after they tried to disrupt test matches between the Springboks and [[Australia national rugby union team|Australia]] in response to South African apartheid policies. Some people even attempted to saw down goal posts and dig trenches in the surface at the [[Sydney Cricket Ground]] to try to stop a test match going ahead, and in Queensland, a [[state of emergency]] was issued following fears prompted from the behaviour of people at the previous tests. Due to the success of the protests in disrupting the event, the [[Cricket Australia|Australian Cricket Board]] canceled the South African team's imminent tour due to security reasons.
* Perhaps the most infamous of pitch invasions at rugby matches occurred at the [[1981 Springbok tour]] of New Zealand. At Rugby Park in Hamilton (now the site of [[Waikato Stadium]]), 350 people pulled down a fence to invade the pitch, and police were forced to cancel the match after arresting a number of people after they got word that an escaped prisoner was piloting a light plane to fly around the stadium. The last test at [[Eden Park]] in Auckland was disrupted after protesters threw flour bombs and other objects onto the pitch to disrupt the game.
* During a 2002 rugby Tri-Nations match in Durban between South Africa and New Zealand, a drunk South African fan, Pieter van Zyl, scaled a perimeter fence, ran onto the pitch and tackled referee David McHugh, leaving McHugh with a dislocated shoulder and having to be carried from the pitch on a stretcher. Springbok lock, [[AJ Venter]] punched van Zyl and All Blacks flanker [[Richie McCaw]]  wrestled him to the ground whereupon police and security arrested him. van Zyl was convicted of trespassing and assault, and was sentenced to three months in jail, fined $275, and banned for life from attending rugby matches in South Africa.
* Another incident involving the South African team took place at the [[2003 Rugby World Cup]] in Australia when an intoxicated Samoan fan, with his face painted in the red and blue of the Samoan flag, ran onto the pitch and attempted to tackle Springbok [[Louis Koen (rugby player)|Louis Koen]] as he was kicking a goal in the late stages of a pool match against [[Samoa national rugby union team|Samoa]]. Koen kicked the goal, but also managed to inadvertently knock the fan unconscious with a kick to the head, as the fan had tried to tackle Koen around the legs.
* During a [[2011–12 Top 14 season|2011]] [[Top 14]] match between [[Northern Basque Country|Basque]] rivals [[Biarritz Olympique|Biarritz]] and [[Aviron Bayonnais|Bayonne]], players from both teams were involved in a brief off-the-ball brawl, among them Biarritz' [[Basques|Basque]] star and [[France national rugby union team|France international]] [[Imanol Harinordoquy]]. His father Lucien ran onto the pitch to attempt to defend his son, but was quickly wrestled to the ground by Bayonne players and taken from the pitch. The elder Harinordoquy issued an apology after the match, with his son choosing not to comment on the affair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.espnscrum.com/france-top-14-2011-12/rugby/story/155284.html |title=Harinordoquy's father apologises |work=ESPN Scrum |date=30 November 2011 |accessdate=2011-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Arena sports==
Most arena sports (like [[ice hockey]], [[arena football]], and [[indoor soccer]]) take precautions to separate the spectators from the players and to ensure one cannot cross into the other. This is not only for the protection of the players but also the spectators as it also helps prevent pucks, balls, and other objects from flying at speed into spectators and causing injury. Often, in addition to sidewalls, [[Plexiglas]] panels are used as a safety measure. Ice hockey uses the panels around the ice, team benches, and [[penalty box]]es to enforce separation under the rules, and after the [[Death of Brittanie Cecil|death of a young spectator]] in [[Columbus Blue Jackets|Columbus, Ohio]] in 2002, tall netting above the Plexiglas to protect spectators in each shooting end. Furthermore, the iced surface means stepping onto a hockey rink without [[ice skate|skates]] is dangerous. A few attempts to intrude in arena games have usually ended with physical player intervention.

'''Silesian Stadium''' (Polish: ''Stadion Śląski'') is a [[sport]] [[stadium]] located on the premises of [[Silesian Park]] in [[Chorzów]], [[Poland]]. The stadium has a fully covered capacity of 55,211&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldstadiums.com/europe/countries/poland.shtml|title=Stadiums in Poland|publisher=World Stadiums|accessdate=13 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;, after a recent refurbishment completed in October 2017. The stadium hosted many [[Polish national football team]] matches and for many decades was Poland's national stadium. After the [[National Stadium, Warsaw|National Stadium]] in [[Warsaw]] had been completed, the Silesian Stadium lost that role. The stadium was not in operation between 2009 and 2017 due to its ongoing reconstruction.

Silesian Stadium is a [[UEFA]] [[Category 4 stadium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dziennikzachodni.pl/sport/stadion-slaski/a/stadion-slaski-w-najwyzszej-kategorii-wedlug-uefa-co-to-znaczy,12749518/|title=Stadion Śląski w najwyższej kategorii według UEFA!

==History==

[[File:Chorzów, Stadion Śląski - fotopolska.eu (311344).jpg|left|thumb|230px|The opening ceremony of Silesian Stadium, Chorzów, 1956]]

In 1950, as a part of an ambitious project to build [[Silesian Park]], plans for Silesian Stadium were drawn up by Julian Brzuchowski.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.inyourpocket.com/katowice/Silesian-Stadium_72617f|title=Silesian Stadium: Back in Business!|publisher=InYourPocket|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Construction began in 1951, and the stadium opened in 1956. The stadium was inaugurated on 22 July 1956 with a match against [[East Germany]].

In 1993, the stadium officially was branded as Polish national stadium, due to the state of the venue in [[Warsaw]]. The stadium regularly hosted football matches, as well as concerts and other events.{{cn|date=November 2018}}

===Modernization===

Silesian Stadium was one of the venues shortlisted for [[UEFA Euro 2012]] tournament, but it did not make the final list. The venue was also shortlisted as the Polish candidate for [[UEFA Euro 2020]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.pl/1/5/Artykul/133255,Silesian-Stadium-picked-as-Euro-2020-candidate|title=Silesian Stadium picked as Euro 2020 candidate|publisher=Radio Poland|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

From 2009, the stadium underwent modernization which included the construction of a 43,000 square metre roof, new stands, lighting, video screens and an improved sound system. The speedway track has been replaced with a traditional track that will allow Chorzów to host international athletics events. The new roof collapsed in 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://stadiumdb.com/news/2017/06/poland_slaski_slowly_rising_for_glory_again|title=Poland: Śląski slowly rising to glory (?) again|publisher=Stadiumdb.com|accessdate=14 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; putting project on hold. Though originally planned to be completed by autumn 2011 for 415 million złoty, the finishing touches were only completed in 2017 costing around 650 million złoty.

===Football===

====Club football====
Numerous [[Ekstraklasa]] matches have been played - mostly by the local team [[Ruch Chorzów]], especially for the [[Local derbies in Poland#The Great Silesian Derby|Great Silesian Derby matches]] against neighbours [[Górnik Zabrze]] due to extra interest from the fans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dziennikzachodni.pl/sport/pilka-nozna/gornik-zabrze/a/gornik-ruch-02-wielkie-derby-slaska-dla-niebieskich-zdjecia-relacja-wideo,9418738/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-01 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160617105712/http://www.dziennikzachodni.pl/sport/pilka-nozna/gornik-zabrze/a/gornik-ruch-02-wielkie-derby-slaska-dla-niebieskich-zdjecia-relacja-wideo,9418738/ |archivedate=2016-06-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As it used to be the only national stadium with such a large capacity in the country for numerous years, [[Polish Cup]] matches have been frequently hosted there too,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stadionslaski.pl/stadion/mecze_ekstraklasy.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417050653/http://www.stadionslaski.pl/stadion/mecze_ekstraklasy.html |archivedate=2016-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; especially the final matches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.stadionslaski.pl/stadion/finaly_pucharu_polski.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2016-04-01 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417064840/http://www.stadionslaski.pl/stadion/finaly_pucharu_polski.html |archivedate=2016-04-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Skeleton''' is a [[Winter sports|winter sliding sport]] in which a person rides a small [[sled]], known as a skeleton bobsled (or -sleigh), down a frozen track while lying face down and head-first. The sport and the sled may have been named from the bony appearance of the sled.&lt;ref name="eb"&gt;[http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/547402/skeleton-sledding Skeleton sledding] Encyclopædia Britannica, 2013-07-23.&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike other sliding sports of [[bobsleigh]] and [[luge]], the race always involves single riders. Like bobsleigh, but unlike luge, the race begins with a running start from the opening gate at the top of the course. The skeleton sled is thinner and heavier than the luge sled, plus skeleton gives the rider more control making it safer than luge.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.shape.com/blogs/shape-your-life/luge-vs-skeleton-racing-whats-difference|title=How Are Luge and Skeleton Racing Different?|date=23 January 2014|website=Shape.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Skeleton is the slowest of the three sliding sports, as skeleton's face down head-first riding position is less aerodynamic than luge's face up, feet-first ride.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.thrillist.com/news/nation/winter-olympics-2018-luge-skeleton-bobsled-difference-explained|title=Here's How You Can Tell the Difference Between Luge, Skeleton, and Bobsled|first=Dustin|last=Nelson|date=19 February 2018|website=Thrillist.com|accessdate=17 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Previously, skeleton appeared in the Olympic program in [[St.&amp;nbsp;Moritz]], [[Switzerland]], in [[Skeleton at the 1928 Winter Olympics|1928]] and again in [[Skeleton at the 1948 Winter Olympics|1948]].&lt;ref name="SMTC"/&gt; It was added permanently to the Olympic program for the [[Skeleton at the 2002 Winter Olympics|2002 Winter Olympics]], at which stage a women's race was added.

During elite racing the rider experiences forces up to 5{{nbsp}}[[g-force|g]] and reaches speeds over 130&amp;nbsp;km/h (80&amp;nbsp;mph).&lt;ref name="eb" /&gt;

==History==
The skeleton originated in [[St. Moritz, Switzerland|St.&amp;nbsp;Moritz]], [[Switzerland]], as a spinoff of the popular British sport called [[Cresta Run|Cresta sledding]]. Although skeleton "sliders" use equipment similar to that of Cresta "riders", the two sports are different: while skeleton is run on the same track used by [[bobsled]]s and [[luge]], Cresta is run on Cresta-specific sledding tracks only. Skeleton sleds are steered using torque provided by the head and shoulders. The Cresta toboggan does not have a steering or braking mechanism, though Cresta riders use rakes on their boots in addition to shifting body weight to help [[Steering|steer]] and [[brake]]. 

The sport of skeleton can be traced to 1882, when English soldiers constructed a [[toboggan]] track between the towns of [[Davos]] and [[Klosters]] in [[Switzerland]]. While toboggan tracks were not uncommon at the time, the added challenge of curves and bends in the Swiss track distinguished it from those of Canada and the [[United States]].&lt;ref name="FIBT"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fibt.com/skeleton/history.html |title=History |publisher=Fibt.com |date=1999-10-02 |accessdate=2014-02-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140214001619/http://www.fibt.com/skeleton/history.html |archivedate=14 February 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The source of the word is debated; some speculating because the original sleds looked like [[skeletons]], and others because of an incorrectly [[anglicized]] version of the [[Norwegian language|Norwegian]] word for toboggan, "Kjaelke".

Approximately {{convert|30|km|-1|abbr=on}} away in the winter sports town of St.&amp;nbsp;Moritz, British men had long enjoyed racing one another down the busy, winding streets of the town, causing an uproar among citizens because of the danger to pedestrians and visiting tourists. In 1884, Major William Bulpett, with the backing of winter sports pioneer and [[Kulm (district)|Kulm]] hotel owner [[Caspar Badrutt]], constructed [[Cresta Run]], the first sledding track of its kind in St.&amp;nbsp;Moritz.&lt;ref name="BBSA"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.bobskeleton.org.uk/index.php?item=55 |title=British Bob Skeleton Association |accessdate=2007-07-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The track ran three-quarters of a mile from St.&amp;nbsp;Moritz to [[Celerina/Schlarigna|Celerina]] and contained ten turns still used today. When the [[Winter Olympic Games]] were held at St.&amp;nbsp;Moritz in [[1928 Winter Olympics|1928]] and [[1948 Winter Olympics|1948]], the Cresta Run was included in the program, marking the only two times skeleton was included as an Olympic event before its permanent addition in 2002 to the Winter Games.&lt;ref name="SMTC"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cresta-run.com/html/general_info.cfm |title=St. Moritz Tobogganing Club |accessdate=2007-07-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20121209005208/http://www.cresta-run.com/html/general_info.cfm |archivedate=9 December 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1887 Grand National competition in St.&amp;nbsp;Moritz, a Mr. Cornish introduced the now-traditional head-first position, a trend that was in full force by the 1890 Grand National.&lt;ref name="SMTC" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2007 |title =Skeleton Sledding |encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===International expansion===
Until 1905, skeleton was practiced mainly in Switzerland; however, in 1905, [[Styria]] held its first skeleton competition in [[Mürzzuschlag]], [[Austria]]. This opened the door to other national skeleton competitions including the [[Austria]]n championship held the following year. In 1908 and 1910, skeleton competitions were held in the [[Semmering Pass]].&lt;ref name="FIBT"/&gt; As the popularity of the sport grew, skeleton evolved into the sport recognized today. In 1892, the sled was transformed by L.&amp;nbsp;P. Child, an Englishman. The newly designed bare-bones sled resembled a human skeleton, and the sport adopted its modern name of skeleton, though it is still recognized as tobogganing in many countries.&lt;ref name="FIBT"/&gt;

In 1923, the [[Federation Internationale de Bobsleigh et de Tobogganing]] (FIBT) was established as the governing body of the sport. Soon afterward, in 1926, the [[International Olympic Committee]] declared bobsleigh and skeleton as Olympic sports and adopted the rules of the St.&amp;nbsp;Moritz run as the officially recognized Olympic rules.&lt;ref name="FIBT"/&gt; It was not until 2002, however, that skeleton itself was added to the Olympic program with the [[2002 Winter Olympics]] in [[Salt Lake City, Utah|Salt Lake City]], [[Utah]].  In 2015, the FIBT was renamed the International Bobsleigh &amp; Skeleton Federation (IBSF), and the Congress of the IBSF adopted its current governing statutes in 2016.&lt;ref name="ibsf-statutes"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2017-12-16 | url = http://www.ibsf.org/images/documents/downloads/IBSF_Statutes_01082016.pdf | format = PDF | title = IBSF Statutes | publisher = International Bobsleigh &amp; Skeleton Federation | date = 12 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Popularity in the sport has grown since the 2002 Winter Olympics and now includes participation by some countries that do not have or cannot have a track because of climate, terrain or monetary limitations. Athletes from such countries as [[Australia]], [[New Zealand]], [[Bermuda]], [[South Africa]], [[Argentina]], [[Iraq]], [[Israel]], [[Mexico]], [[Brazil]], and even the [[Virgin Islands]] have become involved with the sport in recent years.  The IBSF operates an support program for "emerging nations", which provides travel, coaching, and equipment funding assistance to countries which have neither a track nor three qualified pilots in three IBSF disciplines; in 2017, 20 national federations qualified for financial support in men's skeleton, and 11 qualified in women's skeleton.&lt;ref name="ibsf-emerging"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2017-12-16 | url = http://www.ibsf.org/images/documents/downloads/Development/2017_2018/IBSF_Emerging_Nations_Support_Package_2017-18_am.pdf | format = PDF | title = IBSF Emerging Nations Support Package 2017/18 | publisher = International Bobsleigh &amp; Skeleton Federation | date = 29 September 2017 | author = Pengilly, Adam}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== International competitions ==
[[File:Lizzy Yarnold 2017 Lake Placid WC (1 of 3).jpg|thumb|[[Lizzy Yarnold]] competing in the [[2017–18 Skeleton World Cup|World Cup]] at Lake Placid in November 2017]]
The IBSF organizes four competitive circuits for international skeleton competition, in three tiers: two Continental Cups, the Intercontinental Cup (ICC), and the top level [[Skeleton World Cup|World Cup]].  Each athlete receives points based on their results and the level of the competition, which are used to determine both their rankings on each circuit they race in and also an overall ranking across all four circuits.  

National federations are assigned athlete quota spots in the higher levels according to the overall rankings of their individual athletes during the previous season, but are free to send any qualified athlete to a competition in which they have available quota.  However, individual athletes' discipline rankings are used to determine the start order for the first heat of each race: the track becomes less smooth after each successive run, so earlier starts are more desirable.&lt;ref name="rules-2017"&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2017-12-16 | publisher = International Bobsleigh &amp; Skeleton Federation | title = International Skeleton Rules 2017 | url = http://www.ibsf.org/images/documents/downloads/Rules/2017_2018/2017_International_Rules_SKELETON.pdf | format = PDF | date = September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the second (fourth at the World Championships and Winter Olympics) heat, the competitors start in reverse order of their ranking after the previous heat.  (At four-heat races, start order in heats two and three is in ascending order of combined time from the prior heats.)

In addition to the four race series, the IBSF also organizes World Championships, which are held at the end of every sliding season except when the [[Olympic Winter Games]] are held, and a Junior World Championships (open to athletes aged 23 and under) which are held annually without regard to the Olympics.  One race each World Cup season is also designated the European Championship.&lt;ref name="rules-2017"/&gt;  The IBSF cooperates with the International Olympic Committee to supervise the skeleton races at the Olympic Winter Games, and the IBSF ranking system is used to determine the National Olympic Committees' athlete quota allocations.

On all of the regular competitive circuits, the race days are preceded by three or four days of pre-race training to allow athletes to learn the intricacies of each track, and each athlete must complete a certain number of successful training runs to be eligible to compete.  Normally, if the same competition also includes bobsleigh races, the skeleton races will be held first, as the heavier bobsleighs do more damage to the track.

=== Continental Cups ===
The two Continental Cup series are the Europe Cup (also called "Europa Cup" and "European Cup") and the North American Cup.  Both series are open to athletes from all participating nations, but with some restrictions: the top 15 athletes in combined ranking are not permitted to race in the Continental Cups, and athletes are not permitted to race unless their team has filled all of its assigned quota sports in the World Cup.  In addition, teams are limited to four athletes on their home continent and two athletes on the other continent.  (For the purposes of this restriction, African teams are considered to be home on the Europe Cup and Asian, Oceanian, and South American teams are home on the North American Cup.)&lt;ref name="rules-2017"/&gt;

As the bottom level of international skeleton competition, race results in the Continental Cups are assigned the lowest point values for ranking, with a first-place finish being with 75 points (compared to 120 points for the Intercontinental Cup and 225 points for the World Cup).  Only the top 30 athletes receive ranking points; 30th place is worth 1 point.&lt;ref name="rules-2017"/&gt;  However, two races are generally held in each discipline on a single race weekend, allowing consistently competitive athletes to earn a higher ranking than if they went to a single World Cup race and finished poorly.

=== Intercontinental Cup ===
The Intercontinental Cup (ICC) was introduced as an intermediate level between the Continental Cups and the World Cup; a first-place finish is worth 120 points in the IBSF ranking (vs. 225 points for a World Cup win).  Teams with three athletes in the top 60 (top 45 for women) of the IBSF overall ranking for the previous year may send three athletes (not necessarily the same ones) to each ICC race; teams with two athletes in the top 75 (top 60 for women) may send two; and all other teams may send one athlete each.  In order to be eligible to race in the ICC, athletes must have received a ranking in at least five IBSF competitions at three different tracks in the previous two years.&lt;ref name="rules-2017"/&gt;

=== World Cup ===
{{main article|Skeleton World Cup}}

The World Cup is the top level of international skeleton competition, and has the most stringent team quotas, with no teams receiving an automatic entry.  To qualify, a team must have placed at least one athlete in the top 60 of the overall ranking table (top 45 for women); teams with two athletes in the top 50 (top 35 for women) receive two quota spots, and teams with three athletes in the top 30 (top 25 for women) receive three.  The same athlete experience requirements as apply to the ICC also apply to the World Cup.&lt;ref name="rules-2017"/&gt;  At the end of the World Cup season, the man and woman with the highest ranking, considering only points earned in World Cup races, are given a trophy known as the "Crystal Globe".

=== Continental Championships ===
One World Cup race a year may be designated as a continental championship for the continent on which it is held.  This championship is a "paper" race, based only on the times in the regularly scheduled World Cup event, with the athletes representing a different continent excluded.  Currently, this is done only in Europe; the 2017/18 European Championship races were the World Cup races held on 15 December 2017 at [[Innsbruck]], [[Austria]].  The current European champions are [[Martins Dukurs]] of Latvia&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2017-12-17 | title = European Championship (Men's Skeleton) | date = 15 December 2017 | url = http://www.ibsf.org/en/component/events/event/169809 | publisher = International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Elena Nikitina]] of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2017-12-17 | title = European Championship (Women's Skeleton) | date = 15 December 2017 | url = http://www.ibsf.org/en/component/events/event/169810 | publisher = International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Senior World Championships ===
{{for|a list of past winners|Skeleton World Championships}}

In non-Olympic years, a national federation volunteers to organize the (Senior) World Championships (for both bobsleigh and skeleton), which are open to all athletes meeting the experience requirements that apply to the World Cup and the ICC (including junior athletes).  The quota system for the Senior World Championships is the same as for the World Cup, except that all national federations are entitled to send one athlete.  The defending Junior World Champion in each discipline also receives an automatic entry.  Unlike all other IBSF-sponsored races, the World Championships use a two-day, four-heat format, with rankings determined by total time for all four heats.&lt;ref name="rules-2017"/&gt;

The 2016/17 World Championships were held at [[Königssee bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton track]] in [[Bavaria]], 24–26 February 2017.  [[Martins Dukurs]] of Latvia won the men's competition&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2017-12-16 | publisher = International Bobsleigh &amp; Skeleton Federation | date = 26 February 2017 | url = http://www.ibsf.org/en/component/events/event/168617 | title = World Championship}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Jacqueline Lölling]] of Germany won the women's competition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2017-12-16 | publisher = International Bobsleigh &amp; Skeleton Federation | date = 25 February 2017 | url = http://www.ibsf.org/en/component/events/event/168615 | title = World Championship}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Because 2018 was an Olympic year, no World Championships were held for the 2017/18 season.

=== Junior World Championships ===
The Junior World Championships are held every year, but are scheduled to avoid conflict with the Olympics and the Senior World Championships.  Junior athletes are those who are under 23 years of age, or who turn 23 at some point during the competitive season.  All countries are entitled to send up to three athletes to the Junior World Championships, subject to the requirement that each entrant must have finished at least three IBSF sanctioned competitions on at least two tracks in the previous two years.&lt;ref name="rules-2017"/&gt;

The 2017–18 Junior World Championships were held on 25 January 2018 in [[St. Moritz-Celerina Olympic Bobrun|St. Moritz]], [[Switzerland]], and the winners were [[Anna Fernstädt]] of Germany and [[Nikita Tregubov]] of Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | publisher = International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation | accessdate = 2018-02-02 | date = 25 January 2018 | title = Skeleton Athletes Anna Fernstädt and Nikita Tregubov Junior World Champions | url = http://www.ibsf.org/en/news/9-skeleton/20497-skeleton-athletes-anna-fernstaedt-and-nikita-tregubov-junior-world-champions}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Olympic Winter Games ===
{{main|Skeleton at the Winter Olympics}}

The skeleton event in the Winter Olympics uses the same two-day, four-heat format as the World Championships, but team quotas are significantly smaller.  The International Olympic Committee assigns athlete quotas to national Olympic committees in cooperation with the IBSF and using the IBSF ranking system to determine qualification; 20 women and 30 men competed at the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] in Pyeongchang, Korea, with one automatic quota going to the host country (Korea) for each gender.  For men, three countries received three quota spots each, six were allocated two spots, and five got one; for women, two countries received three spots, four got two, and two got one.  The ranking of the countries for quota assignment was based on their third-highest, second-highest, or highest ranked athlete in total IBSF ranking over the qualification period.  In addition, three quota spots are reserved for countries whose continent did not receive any representation based on this assignment procedure.

National Olympic Committees may send athletes other than the ones whose rankings earned the quota spot, but the athletes chosen must be ranked in the top 60 (for men) or top 45 (for women) on the IBSF list and meet similar experience requirements to those that apply to the World Cup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | accessdate = 2017-12-16 | publisher = International Bobsleigh &amp; Skeleton Federation | title = Qualification System for the XXIII Olympic Winter Games PyeongChang 2018: Skeleton | date = 17 May 2016 | url = http://www.ibsf.org/images/documents/downloads/Quotas/2016_17/2016-05-17_-_PyeongChang_2018_Qualification_System_-_Skeleton_V1.1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, IBSF rule 4.1 provides that, for the purposes of determining the top 60 (or top 45) qualification, lower-ranking athletes from countries which have already received a full quota are "cleaned" from the list before an athlete's ordinal ranking is determined&lt;ref name="rules-2017"/&gt;  This had the effect of allowing continental representatives for Africa into the 2018 games, as they would otherwise have been too low on the ranking list to qualify (notably, Nigerian slider [[Simidele Adeagbo]] was ranked 74th before cleaning,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | publisher = International Bobsleigh and Skeleton Federation | title = Standings (2017/2018) (Women's skeleton) (IBSF ranking) | url = http://www.ibsf.org/en/rankings/rankings?season=2017&amp;ctype=6&amp;session= | accessdate = 2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt; but was in the top 45 after application of rule 4.1).

==Sport==
The accessibility of skeleton to [[Amateur sports|amateurs]] may have been the catalyst for its upswing in popularity. Most notably, [[Nino Bibbia]], a fruit and vegetable merchant from [[St. Moritz]], Switzerland, took Olympic gold at the 1948 event.&lt;ref name="BBSA" /&gt; With the advent of the first artificially refrigerated track in 1969 at [[Königssee]]/[[Berchtesgaden]], [[Germany]], athletes are currently able to practice the sport regardless of weather conditions.&lt;ref name="FIBT"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |year=2004 |title =Skeleton, in winter sports |encyclopedia=The Columbia Encyclopedia |publisher=Columbia University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sport is also promoted by skeleton officials as a gateway sport to “train young, aspiring athletes…for their future career in bobsleigh.”&lt;ref name="FIBT"/&gt;

===Track===
{{main|List of bobsleigh, luge, and skeleton tracks}}

===Sled===
“The ‘toboggans’ used in [[Alpine states|Alpine countries]] at the end of the 19th century were inspired by Canadian/Indian sleds used for transport”.&lt;ref name="FIBT"/&gt; Various additions and redesigning efforts by athletes have led to the skeleton sleds used today. In 1892, L.&amp;nbsp;P. Child introduced the “America”, a new metal sled that revolutionized skeleton as a sport. The stripped-down design provided a compact sled with metal runners, and the design caught on quickly. In 1902, Arden Bott added a sliding seat to help athletes shift their weight forward and backward, a feature that is no longer included on modern sleds.

In 2010, the FIBT restricted the materials with which skeleton sleds are permitted to be made. Sled frames must be made of steel and may not include steering or braking mechanisms. The base plate, however, may be made of plastics. The handles and bumpers found along the sides of the sled help secure the athlete during a run.&lt;ref name="rules"&gt;{{cite book |title= IBSF International Skeleton Rules |year= 2015 |url=http://www.ibsf.org/images/documents/downloads/2015_International_Rules_SKELETON.pdf |format= pdf |accessdate= 2017-03-19 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Further specifications are included in the FIBT ruling regarding sled dimensions:&lt;ref name="FIBT"/&gt;&lt;ref name="rules" /&gt;

Some athletes opt to attach ballasts if the combined weight of athlete and sled falls below the maximum combined weight. These ballasts may only be added to the sled, not the rider.

'''T-Bones Stadium''', formerly CommunityAmerica Ballpark, is a [[baseball park]] in [[Kansas City, Kansas]], located in the Kansas City neighborhood of [[Piper, Kansas]]. It is home of the [[Kansas City T-Bones]] of the independent [[American Association of Independent Professional Baseball|American Association]], and the former home of the [[Kansas City Wizards]] (now Sporting Kansas City) of [[Major League Soccer]]. It is located in the [[Village West]] area at 1800 Village West Parkway. Many local area High School teams, including Bonner Springs High School, in there annual [[Butch Foster Memorial Baseball Classic]] play at the ballpark and it is also the home of the [[Kansas City Kansas Community College]] Blue Devils. It has also been used for concerts and some community events.

== Description ==
[[File:CommunityAmerica Ballpark2.JPG|180px|left|thumb|View from center field]]
The ballpark was originally named after [[CommunityAmerica Credit Union]], a Kansas City area financial institution, which held naming rights to the park from 2002 to 2017. The reported dimensions of CommunityAmerica are {{convert|300|ft|m}} down the left field line (with an {{convert|18|ft|m|sing=on}} wall, affectionately known as "the Little Green Monster"), {{convert|411|ft|m}} to left center, {{convert|396|ft|m}} to dead center, {{convert|409|ft|m}} to right center, and {{convert|328|ft|m}} down the right field line.  Walls are about five feet high, with the exception of the Little Green Monster and the bullpen area in left center.&lt;ref&gt;[http://nlfan.com/kansascity/tickets.shtml http://nlfan.com/kansascity/tickets.shtml]&lt;/ref&gt;
The walls are about {{convert|10|ft|m}} high at the bullpens, which are in center field and add a few extra angles and contours to the outfield.  The playing and seating areas are completely surrounded by a {{convert|25|ft|m|sing=on}} wide concourse.
With the addition of bleacher seats in 2008, the park has 6,537 fixed seats, though its capacity (including the concourse, picnic area, right field grass berm, and center field party area) is usually considered over 7,500.

== History ==
Ground was broken on September 4, 2002, and was completed in just over nine months by Titan Construction, opening June 6, 2003.  Baseball had a record paid attendance of 10,345 on June 23, 2007.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|publisher=www.tbonesbaseball.com
|accessdate=2008-04-27
|last=
|first=
}}
&lt;/ref&gt; [[Major League Soccer]] attendance, with the new seating configuration, regularly exceeds 8,000, and its record paid attendance was 10,385 on March 29, 2008.  The 2006 Northern League All-Star game was held at CommunityAmerica Ballpark on July 18, with related festivities the day before.
Sporting Kansas City played its home games at the stadium while the team's new stadium was being constructed. Because of the soccer presence, the Baseball configuration had taken an unusual step. In most natural grass fields the base lines where baserunners run between bases is dirt. However, CommunityAmerica Ballpark had dirt sliding pits just around the three bases, homeplate, and the pitchers mound. This was so that grounds crews would not need to install excessive amounts of grass for each Wizards home game. On March 29, 2008, the Wizards played their first game at the ballpark and defeated [[D.C. United]] 2-0 in front of a sell-out crowd.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the start of the 2008 season, the left field berm area was replaced with permanent bleacher seats.  Additional metal bleachers were added on the concourse running from behind the former left field berm to the bullpens in center field.  This added 2,172 to the ballpark's fixed [[seating capacity]], raising it from its originally 4,365 fixed seats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 3, 2007 the ballpark was the site of a [[world record]]-setting performance of the [[Deep Purple]] hit "[[Smoke on the Water]]" by 1683 guitarists, in a publicity stunt for KYYS radio (now [[KZPT]]).&lt;ref&gt;

On November 20, 2017, the T-Bones announced that the naming rights agreement between the team and CommunityAmerica would not be renewed, with the facility being named T-Bones Stadium on an interim basis. As of June, 2018, no new naming rights partner has been secured. &lt;ref&gt;

In the 19th century, heated saltwater public baths opened and became especially popular with higher classes.&lt;ref name="AMPV"&gt;Projecto para a Construção de Pavilhões na Praia da Póvoa (Maio a Junho de 1924) - Arquivo Municipal da Póvoa de Varzim (2008)&lt;/ref&gt;Others claim that the practice of thalassotherapy is older: "The origins of thermal baths and related treatments can be traced back to remote antiquity. Romans were firm believers in the virtues of thermalism and thalassotherapy.&lt;ref name="Charlier, Roger H 2009"/&gt;

In thalassotherapy, trace elements of [[magnesium]], [[potassium]], [[calcium]], [[sodium]], and [[iodide]] found in seawater are believed to be absorbed through the skin.  The effectiveness of this method of therapy is not widely accepted as it has not been proven scientifically. The therapy is applied in various forms, as either showers of warmed seawater, application of marine [[mud]] or of [[algae]] paste, or the inhalation of sea [[fog]].  [[destination spa|Spas]] make hot seawater and provide mud and seaweed wrapping services.  This type of therapy is common in the [[Dead Sea]] area.{{Citation needed|date=November 2008}}

The '''Tollygunge Club''' {'''টালিগঞ্জ ক্লাব'''}, popularly called '''Tolly''', is a [[country club]] in India, located in [[Tollygunge]] in south [[Kolkata]].

Sir [[William Cruikshank (painter)|William Cruikshank]] established the club as an equestrian sports facility in 1895 to "promote all manner of sports". It is spread over {{convert|100|acre|m2}}, with a clubhouse that is over 200 years old.

==History==

The extensive grounds of the club were originally an [[indigo]] plantation laid out in 1781 by the Johnson family, who were amongst the pioneers of the plantation industry in India.

Later the grounds were to become a royal park at the heart of the princely estate established by the exiled family of [[Tipu Sultan]], the deposed ruler of [[Mysore]] and the house which the Johnsons had built as their home became the garden house of the new Mysore Estate.

In 1895, the entire property was acquired from the Mysore family by the Tollygunge Club Limited and the old Johnson home is today the club's clubhouse.

==Natural surroundings==

The club grounds boast an enviable collection of flowering trees and tropical plants, many of which have been brought from far afield as Australia and South America. These provide a natural sanctuary for a variety of exotic birds. '''Birds &amp; Trees of Tolly''', written by Kushal Mookherjee, explores these in greater detail.

'''Willie McKay''' is a British [[football agent]] based in [[Monaco]]. He is the agent of many top-level footballers, mainly based in England and France  specifically the [[Premier League]]. His clients include [[James McFadden]], [[Joey Barton]], [[Henri Camara]], [[Scott McDonald]], [[Jean-Joël Perrier-Doumbé]], [[Charles N'Zogbia]], [[Tyrone Mears]], [[Amdy Faye]], [[Ross McCormack]], and [[Pascal Chimbonda]]. He is also the agent of his twin sons, [[Jack McKay (footballer, born 1996)|Jack]] and Paul McKay.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Agent McKay has a pair of Doncaster stars in his ranks... his 16-year-old twin sons|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/sport/football/article-2314673/Willie-McKays-16-year-old-sons-star-Doncaster-Rovers-youth-team.html|publisher=Mail Online|date=25 April 2013|accessdate=7 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation by Quest ==

McKay was one of the agents investigated by the Quest team, led by [[John Stevens, Baron Stevens of Kirkwhelpington|Lord Stevens]], which looked into [[2006 allegations of corruption in English football|allegations of "bungs" and fraud in transfers]]. The [[Daily Express]] claimed in December 2006 that the £8.5m transfer of [[Jean-Alain Boumsong]] from [[Rangers F.C.]] to [[Newcastle United]] was one of the deals being examined by Quest. However Quest said of Graeme Souness, who was manager of Newcastle at the time of the Boumsong transfer, "We wish to make it clear that inconsistencies did not exist within the evidence given by Graeme Souness to Quest concerning his role in transfers covered by the Inquiry during his time as manager of Newcastle United FC and neither the Premier League nor do Quest have any concerns in this regard".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/sport.cfm?id=980622007 |title=Edinburgh Evening News |publisher=Edinburghnews.scotsman.com |date=26 November 2009 |accessdate=13 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071031193801/http://edinburghnews.scotsman.com/sport.cfm?id=980622007 |archivedate=31 October 2007 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the final report of the [[2006 allegations of corruption in English football#Stevens report|Stevens inquiry]] he was criticised for his failure to co-operate with the inquiry. However, Quest later issued the following statement: "Further to the key findings from the final Quest report published on 15 June 2007 by the Premier League, Quest would like to emphasise that, in that report, it was clear that no evidence of irregular payments was found in the transfers in the inquiry period which involved the agent Willie McKay. Quest would also like to thank Mr McKay for his cooperation with the inquiry".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,2207222,00.html |title=Quest finds no irregular payments in McKay deals &amp;#124; News &amp;#124; Guardian Unlimited Football |publisher=Football.guardian.co.uk |date= 8 November 2007|accessdate=13 January 2010 | location=London | first=Matt | last=Scott}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 1 February 2008 McKay won substantial libel damages against the Daily Express over false claims about his transfer dealings.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/sport/football/article3290292.ece Willie McKay awarded substantial damages | Football – Times Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]{{Dead link|date=January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==November 2007 arrests==
On 28 November 2007 it was reported by [[BBC News]] that McKay – together with Portsmouth manager Harry Redknapp and Managing Director [[Peter Storrie]], former Portsmouth and then acting Leicester chairman [[Milan Mandaric]], and former Portsmouth footballer [[Amdy Faye]], on loan at Rangers – had been arrested by [[City of London Police]] in relation to the ongoing inquiries into allegations of corruption in football.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7116823.stm Redknapp held in football inquiry] BBC News – 28 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://football.guardian.co.uk/News_Story/0,,2218469,00.html Redknapp arrested in corruption investigation] Guardian Unlimited – 28 November 2007&lt;/ref&gt; Mckay was never charged and police bail was dropped after 2 years.After 2 years of battling to save his name 
With constant pressure by HMRC and City of 
London police Mckay found it very difficult to build back his very successful business 
Mckay put it on Record that the constant obstacles HMRC put in front of him blamed
A unending persecution from an unknown at the very top of the HMRC is still continuing till
this day .

==Doncaster Rovers experiment==
In Doncaster Rovers' [[2011–12 in English football|2011–12]] season they struggled for form, failing to win any of their first seven matches. Then manager, [[Sean O'Driscoll]], was sacked, with [[Dean Saunders]] being brought in to replace him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/sport1/hi/football/teams/d/doncaster/9596378.stm|title=Dean Saunders replaces Sean O'Driscoll at Doncaster|publisher=BBC|date=23 September 2011|accessdate=23 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the help of McKay, Doncaster Rovers brought in several "big–name" players in on loans and short term contracts to try and rescue the club's [[Football League Championship|Championship]] status, &lt;ref name=willie&gt;{{cite web|title=Willie McKay experiment is over – Doncaster's John Ryan|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17727076|publisher=BBC sport|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; including [[El Hadji Diouf]], [[Pascal Chimbonda]], [[Herita Ilunga]], [[Carl Ikeme]], [[Frédéric Piquionne]], and [[Habib Beye]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Agent Willie McKay's plan to keep Doncaster in the Championship|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/15755659|publisher=BBC sport|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other players linked with the club included [[Robert Pires]] and the ex-[[Real Madrid]] midfielder [[Mahamadou Diarra]]. In the end, Doncaster were relegated to [[League One]] with three games still to play after a highly controversial match against Portsmouth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Doncaster 3–4 Portsmouth|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/sport/0/football/17643457|publisher=BBC sport|accessdate=19 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many supporters blamed the failure to stay in the Championship on McKay's involvement, others felt it was worth the try. At the end of the [[2011–12 in English football|2011–12]] season, chairman [[John Ryan (businessman)|John Ryan]] deemed the McKay "experiment" over as it "didn't work" and "wouldn't work in the third tier" anyway.&lt;ref name=willie/&gt;
