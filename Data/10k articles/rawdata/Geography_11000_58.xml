'''7742 Altamira''', provisional designation {{mp|1985 US}}, is a Henan [[asteroid]] from the central region of the [[asteroid belt]], approximately 7 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by Czech astronomer [[Antonín Mrkos]] at the South Bohemian [[Kleť Observatory]] in the Czech Republic, on 20 October 1985.&lt;ref name="MPC-Altamira" /&gt; It was named for the [[Cave of Altamira]] in Spain.&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt;

== Orbit and classification ==

''Altamira'' is a member of the [[Henan family]] ({{small|[[FIN tbl#532|532]]}}),&lt;ref name="Ferret" /&gt; a large [[asteroid family]] in the intermediate main-belt, named after [[2085&amp;nbsp;Henan]].&lt;ref name="Nesvorny-2014" /&gt;{{rp|23}} It orbits the Sun in the [[Kirkwood gap|central]] asteroid belt at a distance of 2.5–2.9&amp;nbsp;[[Astronomical unit|AU]] once every 4 years and 6 months (1,639 days; [[semi-major axis]] of 2.72&amp;nbsp;AU). Its orbit has an [[orbital eccentricity|eccentricity]] of 0.08 and an [[orbital inclination|inclination]] of 4[[Degree (angle)|°]] with respect to the [[ecliptic]].&lt;ref name="jpldata" /&gt; The body's [[observation arc]] begins at [[Palomar Observatory]] in May 1988, two and a half years after its official discovery observation at Klet.&lt;ref name="MPC-Altamira" /&gt;

== Physical characteristics ==

=== Spectral type ===

''Altamira'' has been characterized as an [[L-type asteroid]] by [[Pan-STARRS]] photometric survey,&lt;ref name="Veres-2015" /&gt; which agrees with the overall [[Asteroid spectral type|spectral type]] for members of the [[Henan family]].&lt;ref name="Nesvorny-2014" /&gt;{{rp|23}}

=== Rotation period ===

In January 2014, a rotational [[lightcurve]] of ''Altamira'' was obtained from photometric observation by astronomers at the [[Palomar Transient Factory]] in California. Lightcurve analysis gave a short [[rotation period]] of {{val|2.7}} hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.11 [[Magnitude (astronomy)|magnitude]] ({{small|[[LCDB quality code|U=2]]}}).&lt;ref name="Chang-2015" /&gt;

=== Diameter and albedo ===

According to the survey carried out by the [[NEOWISE]] mission of NASA's [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]], ''Altamira'' measures 6.5 kilometers in diameter, and its surface has an [[astronomical albedo|albedo]] of 0.184.&lt;ref name="WISE" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Masiero-2011" /&gt; The ''Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link'' assumes a standard albedo for carbonaceous asteroids of 0.057 and consequently calculates a larger diameter of 8.7 kilometers.&lt;ref name="lcdb" /&gt;

== Naming ==

This [[minor planet]] was named after the famous [[Cave of Altamira]], located in northern Spain. Discovered in 1879, its prehistoric [[cave painting]]s feature drawings of wild bison, deer, horses and boar, as well as handprints of the artists who created them. The cave with its paintings has been declared a UNESCO [[World Heritage Site]]. The asteroid's name was proposed by Czech astronomer [[Miloš Tichý]].&lt;ref name="springer" /&gt; The official naming citation was published by the [[Minor Planet Center]] on 24 June 2002 ({{small|[[Minor Planet Circulars|M.P.C.]] 46008}}).&lt;ref name="MPC-Circulars-Archive" /&gt;

The '''A71''' is a major [[road]] in [[Scotland]] linking [[Edinburgh]] with [[Lanarkshire]] and [[Ayrshire]]. It adjoins the Livingston Bypass [[A899 road|A899]].

It runs south west from Edinburgh for approximately 70 miles, through [[Saughton]], [[Wilkieston]] and south of [[Livingston, Scotland|Livingston]], [[Whitburn, West Lothian|Whitburn]] and [[Wishaw]], then by way of [[Overtown, North Lanarkshire|Overtown]], [[Garrion Bridge]], [[Stonehouse, South Lanarkshire|Stonehouse]], [[Strathaven]], [[Darvel]], [[Newmilns]], [[Galston, East Ayrshire|Galston]], [[Hurlford]] and [[Kilmarnock]] to [[Irvine, North Ayrshire|Irvine]] on the [[North Ayrshire]] coast.

Formerly a trunk route from the east to the west coast of [[Scotland]] it has since been downgraded to a mix of primary and secondary routes. From Edinburgh to [[Darvel]], it is now a secondary route,in a poor state of repair in some places. But, from Darvel to Irvine, it has retained its [[primary route]] status.

==Route==
===Edinburgh to Newmains===

The A71 almost parallels the [[M8 motorway (Scotland)|M8]] between the [[A720]] (Edinburgh City Bypass) and the junction with the [[A73 road|A73]] at [[Newmains]]. It passes through the village of Wilkieston and onto the [[Mid Calder]] bypass, which leads the route to the south of [[Livingston, Scotland|Livingston]]. The A71 follows a very straight course through [[Livingston, Scotland|Livingston]] with several grade separated junctions.

===Newmains to Darvel===  
[[File:New Garrion Bridge 2001 - A71 - geograph.org.uk - 756210.jpg|thumb|left|A71 crossing the [[River Clyde]] at [[Garrion Bridge]]]]
West of Livingston, the A71 turns sharply south west, bypassing [[Shotts]], [[Newmains]] and [[Wishaw]] then descends steeply into the [[Clyde Valley]], over [[Garrion Bridge]] at the junction with the [[A72 road|A72]]. The A71 climbs steeply up the western side of the Clyde valley on a road which it shares for a very short section with the A72.

When the A71 peaks at the top of the valley, it goes under the [[M74 motorway|M74]] at Jct 8 (a junction known locally as Canderside Toll), before turning towards the village of Stonehouse, where a bypass takes traffic to the north of the narrow village roads, before descending into the [[Avon Water|Avon]] valley and into [[Strathaven]]. This village, at a meeting of the A71, [[A723]] and [[A726]], provides a link to [[East Kilbride]] and [[Paisley, Renfrewshire|Paisley]], as well as to [[Lanark]], [[Hamilton, South Lanarkshire|Hamilton]] and [[Motherwell]].

===Darvel to Irvine===

The A71 then becomes a narrow and winding road across moorland, as the road ascends to the head of the Avon valley. At the highest point is [[Loudoun Hill]], an ancient site of human occupation, and the road here follows the route of a minor [[Roman road]] which once linked the [[River Clyde|Clyde Valley]] and the coast. The road descends into the [[Loudoun|Irvine Valley]], going through the towns of [[Darvel]] and [[Newmilns]], and bypassing [[Galston, East Ayrshire|Galston]] and then through [[Hurlford]]. At Darvel, the A71 becomes a [[primary route]] for the rest of its length to Irvine, and widens slightly, with a straighter alignment until its junction with the [[A77 road|A77]], south of Kilmarnock. The A71 remains as a dual-carriageway until its terminus in Irvine town centre. A crash barrier runs along the central reservation of the dual-carriageway from the A77 to the boundary with North Ayrshire at Dreghorn.

In mid 2014, the road began to subside between Darvel and Newmilns, with the westbound lane being affected near to the entrance to Gowanbank House.  Traffic lights were put in place while a solution was sought, however as of January 2017, a solution has been found and the traffic lights have been lifted.

'''American Memorial Park''' on the island of [[Saipan]], [[Northern Mariana Islands]],&lt;ref&gt;{{GNIS|1393401|American Marianas Memorial Park}}&lt;/ref&gt; was created as a living memorial honoring the sacrifices made during the [[Mariana and Palau Islands campaign|Marianas Campaign]] of [[World War II]].  Recreational facilities, a World War II museum, and flag monument keep alive the memory of over 4,000 [[United States]] military personnel and local islanders who died in June 1944.

The park has [[baseball]], [[bicycling]], [[running]], [[tennis]], [[picnicking]], and [[human swimming|swimming]].

The park is owned by the Government of the Commonwealth of the Northern Mariana Islands, and is managed in cooperation with the [[National Park Service]].

{{Regions of Arkansas}}
The '''Arkansas Delta''' is one of the six [[natural region]]s of the state of [[Arkansas]]. Willard B. Gatewood Jr., author of ''The Arkansas Delta: Land of Paradox'', says that rich cotton lands of the Arkansas Delta make that area "The Deepest of the Deep South."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author= Williard B. Gatewood Jr. and Jeannie M. Whayne, eds.|title=The Arkansas Delta: Land of Paradox|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZWI2SXH20QAC&amp;pg=PA3|year=1996|publisher=University of Arkansas Press|page=3|isbn=978-1-61075-032-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The region runs along the [[Mississippi River]] from [[Eudora, Arkansas|Eudora]] north to [[Blytheville, Arkansas|Blytheville]] and as far west as [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]]. It is part of the [[Mississippi embayment]], itself part of the [[Mississippi Alluvial Plain|Mississippi River Alluvial Plain]].&lt;ref&gt;Gatewood and Whayne 1993, p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; The flat plain is bisected by [[Crowley's Ridge]], a narrow band of rolling hills rising {{convert|250|to|500|ft|m}} above the flat delta plains. Several towns and cities have been developed along Crowley's Ridge, including [[Jonesboro, Arkansas|Jonesboro]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book |last= Smith |first= Richard M. |title= The Atlas of Arkansas |publisher= The University of Arkansas Press |year= 1989 |page= 19 |ISBN= 1557280479 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The region's lower western border follows the [[Arkansas River]] just outside [[Little Rock, Arkansas|Little Rock]] down through [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas|Pine Bluff]]. There the border shifts to [[Bayou Bartholomew]], stretching south to the [[Arkansas]]-[[Louisiana]] state line.

While the Arkansas Delta shares many geographic similarities with the [[Mississippi Delta]], it is distinguished by its five unique sub-regions: the St. Francis Basin, Crowley's Ridge, the White River Lowlands, the Grand Prairie and the Arkansas River Lowlands (also called "the Delta Lowlands"). Much of the region is within the [[Mississippi lowland forests]] ecoregion.

The Arkansas Delta includes the entire territories of 15 counties: [[Arkansas County, Arkansas|Arkansas]], [[Chicot County, Arkansas|Chicot]], [[Clay County, Arkansas|Clay]], [[Craighead County, Arkansas|Craighead]], [[Crittenden County, Arkansas|Crittenden]], [[Cross County, Arkansas|Cross]], [[Desha County, Arkansas|Desha]], [[Drew County, Arkansas|Drew]], [[Greene County, Arkansas|Greene]], [[Lee County, Arkansas|Lee]], [[Mississippi County, Arkansas|Mississippi]], [[Monroe County, Arkansas|Monroe]], [[Phillips County, Arkansas|Phillips]], [[Poinsett County, Arkansas|Poinsett]], and [[St. Francis County, Arkansas|St. Francis]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |title= The Arkansas Delta - The Region |publisher= Arkansas Delta Byways |url= http://www.deltabyways.com/region.htm |accessdate= July 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It also includes portions of another 10 counties: [[Jackson County, Arkansas|Jackson]], [[Lawrence County, Arkansas|Lawrence]], [[Prairie County, Arkansas|Prairie]], [[Randolph County, Arkansas|Randolph]],  [[White County, Arkansas|White]], [[Pulaski County, Arkansas|Pulaski]], [[Lincoln County, Arkansas|Lincoln]], [[Jefferson County, Arkansas|Jefferson]], [[Lonoke County, Arkansas|Lonoke]] and [[Woodruff County, Arkansas|Woodruff]] counties.&lt;ref&gt;Gatewood and Whayne (1993), N.Pag..&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
{{See also|St. Francis River|Crowley's Ridge|White River (Arkansas)|Arkansas River}}
The Delta is subdivided into five unique sub-regions, including the St. Francis Basin, Crowley's Ridge, the White River Lowlands, the Grand Prairie, and the Arkansas River Lowlands (also called "the Delta Lowlands").

===Grand Prairie===
[[File:Rice plot in Arkansas.jpg|right|thumb|Rice field near Stuttgart]]
The underlying impermeable clay layer in the [[Stuttgart soil series]] that allowed the region to be a flat grassland plain initially appeared to stunt the region's growth relative to the rest of the Delta. But in 1897, William Fuller began cultivating rice, a crop that requires inundation, with great success. Rice cultivation still features prominently in the region's economy and culture today. [[Riceland Foods]], the world's largest [[rice]] miller and marketer, is based in [[Stuttgart, Arkansas]] on the Grand Prairie.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite web |title= Grand Prairie |url= http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=2996 |date= December 16, 2011 |first= Guy |last= Lancaster |accessdate= August 28, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{See also|History of Arkansas}}

===Early history and frontier Arkansas===
In the earth's history, after the [[Gulf of Mexico]] withdrew from what was Missouri, many floods occurred in the Mississippi River Delta, building up alluvial deposits. In some places the deposits measure {{convert|100|ft|m}} deep.&lt;ref name=Bowden&gt;Bowden, Charles. "[http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2012/11/arkansas-delta/bowden-text Return to the Arkansas Delta]". ([https://www.webcitation.org/6H6hsLZCZ?url=http://ngm.nationalgeographic.com/2012/11/arkansas-delta/bowden-text Archive]) ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]''. November 2012. Retrieved on June 3, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

The region was occupied by succeeding cultures of indigenous peoples for thousands of years. Some cultures  built major earthwork mounds, with evidence of mound-building cultures dating back more than 12,000 years. These mounds have been preserved in three main locations: the [[Nodena Site]], [[Parkin Archaeological State Park]], and [[Toltec Mounds Archeological State Park]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last= Early |first= Ann M. |title= Indian Mounds |url= http://www.encyclopediaofarkansas.net/encyclopedia/entry-detail.aspx?entryID=573 |date= November 5, 2011 |publisher= The Butler Center |work= Encyclopedia of Arkansas |accessdate= July 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

French explorers and colonists encountered the historic [[Quapaw]] people in this region, who lived along the Arkansas River and its tributaries. The first European settlement in what became the state was the French trading center, [[Arkansas Post National Memorial|Arkansas Post]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |last= Smith |first= Darlene |title= Arkansas Post |work= Arkansas Historical Quarterly |publisher= Arkansas Historical Association |volume= 13 |date= Spring 1954 |page= 120 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The post was founded by [[Henri de Tonti]] while searching for [[Robert de La Salle]] in 1686.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite journal |last= Mattison |first= Ray H. |title= Arkansas Post: Its Human Aspects |work= Arkansas Historical Quarterly |publisher= Arkansas Historical Association |date= Summer 1957 |volume= 16 |pages= 119 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The commerce in the area was initially based on fishing and wild game. The [[fur trade]] and lumber later were critical to the economy.&lt;ref&gt;Gatewood and Whayne 1993, pp. 8-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Early European-American settlers crossed the Mississippi and settled among the swamps and bayous of east Arkansas.  Frontier Arkansas was a rough, lawless place infamous for violence and criminals.&lt;ref&gt;Gatewood and Whayne 1993, pp. 9-10.&lt;/ref&gt; Settlers, who were mostly French and Spanish colonists, generally engaged in a mutually beneficial give-and-take trading relationship with the Native Americans. French trappers often married Quapaw women and lived in their villages, increasing their alliances for trade.

Around 1800 United States settlers gradually entered this area.&lt;ref name=Bowden/&gt; In 1803 the US acquired the territory from France by the [[Louisiana Purchase]].&lt;ref&gt;Arnold et al (2002), p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt; As settlers began to acquire and clear land, they encroached on Quapaw territory and traditional hunting and fishing practices. The two cultures had divergent views of property. Relations deteriorated further after the [[1812 New Madrid earthquake]], which was felt throughout the region and taken as a portent. Some Native Americans considered the earthquake to be a sign of punishment for trading with the European settlers.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold et al (2002), p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

The beginning point of all subsequent surveys of the Louisiana Purchase was placed in the Arkansas Delta near [[Blackton, Arkansas|Blackton]]. In 1993 this site was named a [[National Historic Landmark]] and later preserved as [[Louisiana Purchase State Park]]. A granite marker, accessible via a boardwalk through a swamp, marks the starting point of the survey.&lt;ref name="nhlnom"&gt;{{Cite document |title= National Historic Landmark Nomination: Louisiana Purchase Survey Marker / Louisiana Purchase Initial Point Site |url= http://www.nps.gov/nhl/designations/samples/ar/BeginningPointLouisianaLandSurvey.pdf |format= PDF |last= Baker |first= William D. |date=September 16, 1991 |publisher=National Park Service |accessdate= July 31, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Territorial era through statehood===
{{See also|Arkansas Territory}}
[[File:Lakeport Plantation, Lake Village, Chicot County, Arkansas.jpg|left|thumb|[[Lakeport Plantation]] in Chicot County, built ca. 1850, is one of the few remaining plantation houses in Arkansas.]]
During the antebellum era, American settlers used enslaved African Americans as laborers to drain swamps and clear forests along the river to cultivate the rich alluvial plain. They began to develop cotton plantations, which produced the chief commodity crop of the region.&lt;ref name=Bowden/&gt;

After achieving territorial status in 1819, Arkansas reneged on an 1818 treaty with the Quapaw. Territory officials began removing the Quapaw from their fertile homeland in the Arkansas delta. The Quapaw had inhabited lands along the Arkansas River and near its mouth at the Mississippi River for centuries.

The invention of the [[cotton gin]] had made short-staple cotton profitable, and the Deep South was developed for cotton cultivation. It grew well in fertile delta soils. Settlers took these fertile lands for agriculture and pushed the Quapaw south to [[Louisiana]] in 1825-1826. The Quapaw returned to southeast Arkansas by 1830, but were permanently relocated to [[Oklahoma]] in 1833 under the [[Indian Removal Act]] passed by Congress.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |title= Arkansas Territorial Indian Affairs |first= Lonnie J. |last= White |work= Arkansas Historical Quarterly |volume= 21 |date= Autumn 1962 |page= 197 |publisher= [[Arkansas Historical Association]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

High cotton prices encouraged many planters to concentrate on cotton as a commodity crop, and the large plantations were dependent on [[slave labor]]. The [[plantation economy]] and a slave society were developed in the Arkansas Delta,&lt;ref name=Bowden/&gt; with black slaves forming the majority of the population in these counties. This region developed political interests different from outlying areas where yeomen farmers were concentrated.

Many [[African Americans]] were brought into the Delta throughout the early-to-mid-19th century through the domestic slave trade, transported from the Upper South. The counties with the largest populations of slaves by 1860 included Phillips (8,941), Chicot (7,512), and Jefferson (7,146).{{citation needed|date=June 2013}} Prior to the [[U.S. Civil War]], numerous Delta counties had majority-black and enslaved populations.&lt;ref name=Bowden/&gt; As Arkansas was developed later than some other areas of the Deep South, its wealthy planters did not construct as many grand plantation mansions as in other states. The [[American Civil War]] ended that prosperous antebellum period.&lt;ref name=Bowden/&gt;

The Civil War resulted in destruction to the river levees and other property damage. Expensive investment was required to repair the levees. The region's continued reliance on agriculture kept wages low, and the cotton market did not recover. Many [[freedmen]] stayed in the area, working by [[sharecropping]] and [[tenant farming]] as a way of life.

===20th century, through Civil Rights era===
{{expand section|date=June 2013}}
Like other states of the former Confederacy, the state legislature of Arkansas passed laws to [[Disfranchisement after Reconstruction era|disenfranchise most blacks]] and many poor whites, in an effort to suppress Republican voting. It passed the Election Law of 1891, which required secret ballots, and standardized ballots, eliminating many illiterate voters. It also created a centralized election board, providing for consolidation of Democratic political power. Having reduced voter rolls, in 1892 the Democrats passed a [[poll tax]] amendment to the constitution, creating another barrier to voter registration for struggling white and black workers alike, many unable to pay such fees in a cash-poor economy. These two measures caused sharp declines in the number of African-American and white voters; by 1895 no African-American members were left in the General Assembly. The Republican Party was hollowed out, and the farmer-labor alliance collapsed. Most blacks were kept off the rolls and out of electoral politics for more than six decades, until after Congressional passage of the [[Voting Rights Act of 1965]], although a concerted effort in the 1940s increased voter registration.

Social tensions rose in the area after World War I, as black veterans pushed for better conditions. Unlike other mass riots of [[Red Summer]] 1919, when whites attacked blacks in numerous northern and midwestern cities because of labor and social competition, the [[Elaine Race Riot]], now known as the "Elaine Massacre", was the result of rural forces. It occurred near [[Elaine, Arkansas]] in the Delta, where local planters were trying to discourage the formation of an agricultural union among blacks. White mobs killed an estimated 237 blacks; five whites were killed in the unrest.

The area suffered extensively during the [[Great Mississippi Flood of 1927]], which put tens of thousands of acres underwater, caused extensive property damage, and left many people homeless.{{citation needed|date=June 2013}}

In the 1940s the mechanized cotton picker was introduced into regional agriculture. This led to a significant decline in demand for manual labor. During World War II, the defense industry in California and other western locations attracted many African-American workers from Arkansas, Louisiana and Texas in a second wave of the [[Great Migration (African American)|Great Migration]], resulting in a marked population decrease in the Delta. The lack of jobs continued to cause a decline. Charles Bowden of ''[[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]]'' wrote, "By 1970 the sharecropping world was already disappearing, and the landscape of today—huge fields, giant machines, battered towns, few people—beginning to emerge."&lt;ref name=Bowden/&gt;

== Music ==
The Arkansas Delta is known for its rich musical heritage.  While defined primarily by its deep blues/gospel roots, it is distinguished somewhat from its Mississippi Delta counterpart by more intricately interwoven [[country music]] and [[R&amp;B]] elements.  Arkansas blues musicians have defined every genre of blues from its inception, including [[ragtime]], [[hokum]], [[country blues]], [[Delta blues]], [[boogie-woogie]], [[jump blues]], [[Chicago blues]], and [[blues-rock]].  Eastern Arkansas' predominantly African-American population in cities such as [[Helena, Arkansas|Helena]], [[West Memphis, Arkansas|West Memphis]], [[Pine Bluff, Arkansas|Pine Bluff]], [[Brinkley, Arkansas|Brinkley]], [[Cotton Plant, Arkansas|Cotton Plant]], [[Forrest City, Arkansas|Forrest City]] and others has provided a fertile backdrop of juke joints, clubs and dance halls which have so completely nurtured this music.  Many of the nation's blues pioneers were either born in the Arkansas Delta or lived in the region.  

Today the region hosts several blues events throughout the year, culminating in the Arkansas Blues and Heritage Fest. The festival attracts an average of about 85,000 people per day over its three-day run; it is rated in the top 10 music events in the nation by festivals.com.

[[Gospel music]], the mother of Delta Blues, is enshrined in the lives and social fabric of residents.  Many popular Delta artists in all other genres had their start singing or playing in church choirs and quartets.  Given the historic racism and entrenched segregation in the Delta, the African-American church and, by extension, its music, have taken on a central role in the lives of residents.  African-American gospel music's roots are deep in the Delta. Unlike the blues, which has been historically dominated by men throughout the Delta, women established a pioneering role in gospel music.  From the quartet traditions that dominate south Arkansas, to the classic and contemporary solo artists who have found national prominence in the east, gospel music in the Delta has made and continues to make a significant mark on the cultural landscape.

The Arkansas Delta's country music roots have depth, with legendary performers coming from the area.  While more geographically dispersed throughout the region, these artists represent the very best in country genres, including [[Bluegrass music|bluegrass]], [[rockabilly]], [[folk music]], and [[alternative country]].  This music expresses the long-standing relationship between blues and country. As young country musicians continue to develop in the Delta, they continue to help the genre grow and evolve.

R&amp;B music has also had a presence as an outgrowth of the strong blues and gospel traditions.  The East Central Delta area has produced a small number of talented and influential R&amp;B artists.

Arkansas's blues Influence, shares a rich heritage with Mississippi and [[Memphis, Tennessee]]. Arkansas was home to numerous blues masters, who are held in high esteem by newer generations learning blues history. Arkansas blues artists influenced decades of pop culture music by such artists as Muddy Waters, Little Milton, B.B. King, Eric Clapton, Jeff Beck, Joe Bonamassa, Stevie Ray Vaughan, George Harrison and the Rolling Stones. Some of the most notable Arkansas Delta born or affiliated blues/gospel artists include: Albert King, Big Bill Broonzy, Sippie Wallace, George Thomas, Bobby Rush, Eb Davis, Frank Frost, George Harmonica Smith, Hollis Gillmore, Howlin’ Wolf, Hubert Sumlin, James Cotton, Johnny Shines, Junior Walker, Sonny Boy Williamson II, Junior Wells, Larry Davis, Louis Jordan, Luther Allison, Michael Burks, Robert Johnson, Robert Lockwood Jr., Al Bell, J. Mayo "Ink" Williams, Robert Nighthawk, Sam Carr, Houston Stackhouse, James Cotton, Johnny Taylor, Shirley Brown, William "Petey Wheatstraw" Bunch, Son Seals, Luther Allison, Sister Rosetta Tharpe, Al Green, and others. Country/ Americana artists Johnny Cash and Levon Helm were also born and raised in the Arkansas Delta.

[[File:Downtown Jonesboro AR 001.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jonesboro, Arkansas|Jonesboro]], the largest city in the delta region]] 
The Arkansas Delta economy is still dominated by agriculture. The main commodity crop is [[cotton]]; other crops include [[rice]] and [[soybeans]].  [[Catfish farming]] has been developed as a new source of revenue for Arkansas Delta farmers, along with poultry production.

The Delta has some of the lowest population densities in the [[American South]], sometimes fewer than 1 person per square mile. Slightly more than half the population is African American, reflecting their deep history in the area. Eastern Arkansas has the most cities in the state with majority African-American populations.  Urbanization and the shift to mechanization of farm technology during the past 60 years has sharply reduced jobs in the Delta. People have followed jobs out of the region, leading to a declining tax base. This hampers efforts to support education, infrastructure development, community health and other vital aspects of growth.  The region's remaining people suffer from unemployment, extreme poverty, and illiteracy.

The [[Delta Cultural Center]] in [[Helena, Arkansas|Helena]] seeks to preserve and interpret the culture of the Arkansas Delta along with the [[University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff]]'s University and Cultural Museum.  The Arts and Science Center for Southeast Arkansas in [[Pine Bluff]] is charged with highlighting and promoting works of Delta artists.

The [[ivory-billed woodpecker]], which had not been sighted since 1944 and is believed to be [[extinct]], was reportedly seen in a swamp in east Arkansas in 2005.

The '''''Cerrado''''' ({{IPA-pt|seˈʁadu}}, {{IPA-pt|sɛˈʁadu|}}) is a vast [[Tropics|tropical]] [[savanna]] [[ecoregion]] of [[Brazil]], particularly in the states of [[Goiás]], [[Mato Grosso do Sul]], [[Mato Grosso]], [[Tocantins]] and [[Minas Gerais]]. The Cerrado [[biome]] core areas are the [[plateaus]] in the center of Brazil. The main habitat types of the Cerrado include: forest savanna, wooded savanna, park savanna and [[grass|gramineous]]-woody savanna. Savanna wetlands and [[gallery forest]]s are also included.&lt;ref&gt;[http://pt.scribd.com/doc/104063737/Phyto-environmental-characterization-of-Brazilian-Savanna-Cerrado-and-Brazilian-Atlantic-Forest-with-the-research-of-stone-lines-and-paleosols "  VASCONCELOS, Vitor Vieira; VASCONCELOS, Caio Vieira; VASCONCELOS, Davi Mourão Phyto-Environmental Characterization of Brazilian Savanna (Cerrado) and Brazilian Atlantic Forest, with the Research of Stone Lines and Paleosols Geografia. Ensino &amp; Pesquisa (UFSM), v. 14, p. 3, 2010."]&lt;/ref&gt;   The second largest of Brazil's major habitat types, after the Amazonian rainforest, the Cerrado accounts for a full 21 percent of the country's land area (extending marginally into Paraguay and Bolivia).&lt;ref name=conservation&gt;Conservation International. {{cite web |url=http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/cerrado/Pages/default.aspx |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-05-09 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080506090731/http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/Hotspots/cerrado/Pages/default.aspx |archivedate=2008-05-06 |df= }}. Access date: May 5, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The first detailed account of the Brazilian cerrados was provided by Danish botanist [[Eugenius Warming]] (1892) in the [[Eugenius Warming#Lagoa Santa|book Lagoa Santa]],&lt;ref name=warming&gt;Warming, E. (1892) Lagoa Santa: Et Bidrag til den biologiske Plantegeografi med en Fortegnelse over Lagoa Santas Hvirveldyr. Kongelige Danske Videnskabernes Selskabs Skrifter – Naturvidenskabelig og Mathematisk Afdeling, 6. Rk. vol. 6 (3): 153–488. Later French and Portuguese translations&lt;/ref&gt; in which he describes the main features of the cerrado vegetation in the state of Minas Gerais.&lt;ref name=oliveira&gt;Oliveira S., Paulo, and Robert Marquis J. The Cerrados of Brazil : Ecology and Natural History of a Neotropical Savanna. Columbia University Press, 2002. eBook.&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then vast amounts of research have proved that the Cerrado is one of the richest of all tropical savanna regions and has high levels of [[endemism]]. Characterized by enormous ranges of plant and animal biodiversity, [[World Wide Fund for Nature]] named it the biologically richest savanna in the world, with about 10,000 plant species and 10 endemic bird species.&lt;ref name=conservation/&gt; There are nearly 200 species of mammal in the Cerrado, though only 14 are endemic.&lt;ref name=conservation /&gt;

==Climate==
The Cerrado's climate is typical of the rather moister [[savanna]] regions of the world, with a semi-humid [[tropical climate]]. The Cerrado is limited to two dominant seasons throughout the year, wet and dry. Annual temperatures for the Cerrado average between 22 and 27&amp;nbsp;°C and average precipitation between 800–2000&amp;nbsp;mm for over 90% of the area.&lt;ref name=ratter&gt;RATTER, J.A.; RIBEIRO, J.F. &amp; BRIDGEWATER, S. (1997) The Brazilian Cerrado vegetation and Threats to its Biodiversity. Annals of Botany, 80: pp. 223–230&lt;/ref&gt; This [[ecoregion]] has a very strong dry season during the southern winter (approx. April–September).&lt;ref name="ratter" /&gt;

==Flora==
[[Image:Cerrado.jpg|thumb|350px|right|Cerrado vegetation of Brazil.]]
{{category see also|Flora of the Cerrado}}
The Cerrado is characterized by unique vegetation types.&lt;ref name=ratter /&gt; It is composed of a shifting mosaic of habitats, with the savanna-like ''cerrado'' itself on well-drained areas between strips of [[gallery forest]] (closed canopy tall forest) which occur along streams.&lt;ref name=ratter /&gt;&lt;ref name=vierra&gt;VIERRA, E.M. &amp; MARINHO-FILHO, J. (1998). Pre- and Post-Fire Habitat Utilization by Rodents of Cerrado from Central Brazil. Biotropica, 30: pp. 491–496&lt;/ref&gt; Between the ''cerrado'' and the gallery forest is an area of vegetation known as the wet ''campo'' with distinct up- and downslope borders where tree growth is inhibited due to wide seasonal fluctuations in the water table.&lt;ref name=ratter /&gt;&lt;ref name=vierra /&gt;

The savanna portion of the Cerrado is heterogeneous in terms of canopy cover. Goodland (1971) divided the Cerrado into four categories ranging from least to most canopy cover: ''campo sujo'' ([[herbaceous layer]] with occasional small trees about 3 m tall), ''campo cerrado'' (slightly higher density of trees about 4 m tall on average), ''cerrado sensu stricto'' (orchard-like vegetation with trees about 6 m high) and ''[[cerradao]]'' (canopy cover near 50% with general height 9 m).&lt;ref name=goodland&gt;GOODLAND, R. 1971. A physiognomic analysis of the 'cerrado' vegetation of central Brazil. ''Journal of Ecology'', 59: 411- 419&lt;/ref&gt;

Probably around 800 species of trees are found in the Cerrado.&lt;ref name=ratter /&gt; Among the most diverse families of trees in the Cerrado are the [[Leguminosae]] (153), [[Malpighiaceae]] (46), [[Myrtaceae]] (43), [[Melastomataceae]] (32) and [[Rubiaceae]] (30).&lt;ref name=herringer&gt;HERRINGER, E.P.; BARROSO, G.M.; RIZZO J.A. &amp; RIZZINI C.T. 1977. A Flora do Cerrado. In FERRI M.G. ed. ''IV SimpoUsio sobre o cerrado''. São Paulo, Brazil. 211–232&lt;/ref&gt; Much of the Cerrado is dominated by the [[Vochysiaceae]] (23 species in the Cerrado) due to the abundance of three species in the genus ''[[Qualea]]''.&lt;ref name=ratter /&gt; The herbaceous layer usually reaches about 60&amp;nbsp;cm in height and is composed mainly of the [[Poaceae]], [[Cyperaceae]],  [[Leguminosae]], [[Compositae]], [[Myrtaceae]] and [[Rubiaceae]].&lt;ref name=ratter /&gt; Much of the vegetation in the gallery forests is similar to nearby rainforest; however, there are some endemic species found only in the Cerrado gallery forests.&lt;ref name=ratter /&gt;

Soil fertility, fire regime and hydrology are thought to be most influential in determining Cerrado vegetation. Cerrado soils are always well-drained and most are [[oxisol]]s with low pH and low calcium and magnesium.&lt;ref name=ratter /&gt;&lt;ref name=furley&gt;FURLEY P.A. &amp; RATTER, J.A. 1988. Soil resources and plant communities of the Central Brazilian cerrado and their development. ''Journal of Biogeography'' 15: 97–108&lt;/ref&gt; The amount of potassium, nitrogen and phosphorus has been found to be positively correlated with tree trunk basal area in Cerrado habitats.&lt;ref name=goodland2&gt;GOODLAND, R &amp; POLLARD, R. 1973. The Brazilian Cerrado Vegetation: A Fertility Gradient. ''Journal of Ecology'' 61: 219–224&lt;/ref&gt; Much as in other grasslands and savannas, fire is important in maintaining and shaping the Cerrado's landscape; many plants in the Cerrado are fire-adapted, exhibiting characters like thick corky bark to withstand the heat.&lt;ref name=ratter /&gt;

Cerrado vegetation is believed to be ancient, stretching back perhaps as far in a prototypic form during the [[Cretaceous]] before Africa and South America separated.&lt;ref name="ratter2"&gt;RATTER, J.A. &amp; RIBEIRO, J.F. 1996. Biodiversity of the flora of the cerrado. In: PEREIRA, R.C. &amp; NASSER L.C.B., eds. ''Anais/Proceedings of the VIII Simpósio sobre o cerrado 1st Internet. Symposium on Tropical Savannas''. Planaltina, DF, Brazil. EMBRAPA/CPAC: 3–6&lt;/ref&gt; A dynamic expansion and contraction between cerrado and Amazonian rainforest has probably occurred historically, with expansion of the Cerrado during glacial periods like the [[Pleistocene]].&lt;ref name=mayle&gt;MAYLE, F.E.; BURBRIDGE, R. &amp; KILLEEN T.J. 2000. Millennial-Scale Dynamics of Southern Amazonian Rain Forests. Science 290: 2291–2294&lt;/ref&gt;  These processes and the resulting fragmentation have probably contributed to the high [[species richness]] both of the Cerrado and of the Amazonian rainforest.&lt;ref name=ratter /&gt;

==Fauna==
{{category see also|Fauna of the Cerrado}}

The insects of the Cerrado are relatively understudied.&lt;ref name=pinheiro&gt;PINHEIRO, F.; DINIZ, I.R.; COELHO, D. &amp; BANDEIRA, M.P.S. 2002. Seasonal pattern of insect abundance in the Brazilian cerrado. Austral Ecology 27: 132–136&lt;/ref&gt; A yearlong survey of the Cerrado at one reserve in Brazil found that the orders [[Coleoptera]], [[Hymenoptera]], [[Diptera]] and [[Isoptera]] accounted for 89.5% of all captures.&lt;ref name=pinheiro /&gt; The Cerrado also supports high density of leaf cutter ant ("saúvas")  nests (up to 4000 per hectare) which are also very diverse.&lt;ref name=leal&gt;LEAL, I.R. &amp; OLIVEIRA, P.S. 2000. Foraging ecology of attine ants in a Neotropical savanna: seasonal use of fungal substrate in the cerrado vegetation of Brazil. Insectes Sociaux 47: 376–382&lt;/ref&gt; Along with termites, leaf cutter ants are the primary herbivores of the Cerrado and play an important role in consuming and decomposing organic matter, as well as constituting an important food source to many other animal species.&lt;ref name="oliveira freitas"&gt;OLIVEIRA, P.S. &amp; FREITAS, A.V.L. 2004. Ant-plant-herbivore interactions in the neotropical cerrado savanna. Naturwissenschaften 91: 557–570&lt;/ref&gt; The highest diversity of galling insects (insects that build [[gall]]s) in the world is also found in the Cerrado, with the most species (46) found at the base of the Serro do Cipó in southeast Brazil.&lt;ref name=lara&gt;LARA, A.C.F. &amp; FERNANDES, G.W. 1996. The highest diversity of galling insects: Serra dó Cipo, Brazil. Biodiversity Letters 3: 111–114&lt;/ref&gt;

The Cerrado has a high diversity of vertebrates; 150 amphibian species, 120 reptile species, 837 bird species, and 161 mammal species have been recorded.&lt;ref name=myers&gt;MYERS, N.; MITTERMEIER, R.A.; MITTERMEIER, C.G.; DA FONESCA, G.A.B. &amp; KENT, J. 2000. Biodiversity hotspots for conservation priorities. Nature 403: 853–858&lt;/ref&gt; Lizard diversity is generally thought to be relatively low in the Cerrado compared to other areas like ''caatinga'' or lowland rainforest&lt;ref name=vitt&gt;VITT, L. 1991.

[[File:Physalaemus nattereri in deimatic behavior.jpg|thumb|The frog species ''[[Physalaemus nattereri]]'' is found in the open ''cerrado'' but not in adjacent gallery forests.&lt;ref name=brasileiro /&gt;]]
Most birds found in the Cerrado breed there although there are some Austral migrants (breed in temperate South America and winter in the Amazon basin) and Nearctic migrants (breed in temperate North America and winter in the Neotropics) that pass through.&lt;ref name=dasilva&gt;DA SILVA, J.S.C. 1997. Endemic birds species and conservation in the Cerrado region, South America. Biodiversity and Conservation 6: 435–450&lt;/ref&gt; Most breeding birds in the Cerrado are found in more closed canopy areas like gallery forests although 27% of the birds breed only in open habitats and 21% breed in either open or closed habitats.&lt;ref name=dasilva /&gt; Many of the birds in the Cerrado, especially those found in closed forest, are related to species from the Atlantic rainforest and also the Amazon rainforest.&lt;ref name=dasilva2&gt;DA SILVA, J.S.C. 1996. Distribution of Amazonian and Atlantic birds in gallery forests of the cerrado region, South America. Ornitologia Neotropical 7: 1–18&lt;/ref&gt; The [[crowned solitary eagle]], [[hyacinth macaw]], [[toco toucan]], [[buff-necked ibis]], [[dwarf tinamou]], and [[Brazilian merganser]] are examples of birds found in the Cerrado.

Gallery forests serve as primary habitat for most of the mammals in the Cerrado, having more water, being protected from fires that sweep the landscape and having a more highly structured habitat.&lt;ref name=redford&gt;REDFORD, K.H. 1986. The role of gallery forests in the zoogeography of the Cerrado's non-volant mammalian fauna. Biotropica 18: 126–135&lt;/ref&gt; Eleven mammal species are endemic to the Cerrado.&lt;ref name=redford /&gt; Notable species include large herbivores like the [[Brazilian tapir]] and [[Pampas deer]] and large predators like the [[maned wolf]], [[cougar]], [[jaguar]], [[giant otter]], [[ocelot]] and [[jaguarundi]]. Although the diversity is much lower than in the adjacent Amazon and Atlantic Forest, several species of monkeys are present, including [[black-striped capuchin]], [[black howler monkey]] and [[black-tufted marmoset]].&lt;ref name=henriques&gt;HENRIQUES, R.P.B. &amp; CAVALCANTE, R.J. 2004. Survey of a gallery forest orimate community in the cerrado of the Distrito Federal, central Brazil. 12: 78–83&lt;/ref&gt;

==History and human population==

Taking advantage of the sprouting of the herbaceous stratum that follows a burning in the Cerrado, the aboriginal inhabitants of these regions learned to use the fire as a tool, to increase the fodder to offer to their domesticated animals.

Xavantes, Tapuias, Karajás, Avá-Canoeiros, Krahôs, Xerentes, Xacriabás were some of the first indigenous peoples occupying different regions in the Cerrado. Many groups among the indigenous were nomads and explored the Cerrado by hunting and collecting. Others practiced coivara agriculture, an itinerant type of slash-and-burn agriculture. The mixing of indigenous, quilombola maroon communities, extractivists, geraizeiros (living in the drier regions), riverbank dwellers and vazanteiros (who live on floodplains) shaped a diverse local population that relies heavily on the resources of their environment.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ispn.org.br/english/peoples-of-the-cerrado/brazilian-mix/&lt;/ref&gt;

Until the mid-1960s, [[agriculture|agricultural]] activities in the Cerrado were very limited, directed mainly at the extensive production of [[beef cattle]] for subsistence of the local market,&lt;ref name=ratter /&gt; since cerrado soils are naturally infertile for agricultural production. After this period, however, the urban and industrial development of the Southeast Region has forced agriculture to the Central-West Region. The transfer of the country's capital to [[Brasília]] has been another focus of attraction of population to the central region. From 1975 until the beginning of the 1980s, many governmental programs have been launched with the intent of stimulating the development of the Cerrado region, through subsidies for agriculture.&lt;ref name=jenson /&gt; As a result, there has been a significant increase in agricultural and cattle production.

On the other hand, the urban pressure and the rapid establishment of agricultural activities in the region have been rapidly reducing the biodiversity of the ecosystems, and the population in the Cerrado region more than doubled from 1970 to 2010, going from 35.8 million to 76 million.&lt;ref&gt;Development for Sustainable Agriculture: The Brazilian Cerrado https://books.google.ca/books?id=HVzeCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=cerrado+population&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=sIxHN3fc3U&amp;sig=uji_f4hIzqhUQERvaC9Ccu_X5iA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=cerrado%20population&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt;

==Agriculture==

The Cerrado was thought challenging for agriculture until researchers at Brazil's agricultural and livestock research agency, [[Embrapa]], discovered that it could be made fit for industrial crops by appropriate additions of phosphorus and lime. In the late 1990s, between 14 million and 16 million tons of lime were being poured on Brazilian fields each year. The quantity rose to 25 million tons in 2003 and 2004, equalling around five tons of lime per hectare. This manipulation of the soil allowed for industrial agriculture to grow exponentially in the area. Researchers also developed tropical varieties of [[soybean]]s, until then a temperate crop, and currently, Brazil is the world's main [[soybean|soyabeans]] exporter due to the boom in animal feed production caused by the global rise in meat demand.&lt;ref&gt;The Economist. ''Brazilian agriculture: The miracle of the cerrado''. August 26, 2010. http://www.economist.com/node/16886442&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Observatory of Economic Complexity http://atlas.media.mit.edu/en/profile/hs92/1201/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rohter |first=Larry |date=October 2, 2007 |title= Scientists Are Making Brazil's Savannah Bloom |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2007/10/02/science/02tropic.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location= |access-date=December 7, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Today the Cerrado region provides more than 70% of the beef cattle production in the country, being also a major production center of grains, mainly soya, beans, maize and rice.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/investigates/special-report/brazil-deforestation/|title=Appetite for Destruction: Brazil’s soy boom devours tropical savanna|last=Spring|first=Jake|website=Reuters|language=en|access-date=2018-08-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Large extensions of the Cerrado are also used for the production of cellulose pulp for the paper industry, with the cultivation of several species of ''[[Eucalyptus]]'' and ''[[Pinus]]'', but as a secondary activity.  Coffee produced in the Cerrado is now a major export.&lt;ref&gt;Lopes, A. Scheid. "Soils under Cerrado: A Success Story in Soil Management." Better Crops International. 10.2 (1996): n. page.

[[Charcoal]] production for Brazil's [[steel]] industry comes in second to agriculture in the Cerrado.&lt;ref name=herringer /&gt; They actually are quite intertwined. When land is being cleared to make more land for agriculture, the tree's trunks and roots are often used in the production of charcoal, helping to make money for the clearing. The Brazilian steel industry has traditionally always used the trunks and roots from the Cerrado for charcoal but now that the steel mills in the state of [[Minas Gerais]] are the world's largest, it has taken a much higher toll on the Cerrado.&lt;ref name=herringer /&gt; However, recently because of the conservation efforts and the diminishing vegetation in the Cerrado, they now are receiving some charcoal from the [[eucalyptus]] plantations and these efforts are growing.&lt;ref name=herringer /&gt;

==Conservation==
The Cerrado is the second largest biome in South America and the most biodiverse savanna in the world. However, it is not currently recognized by the Brazilian Constitution as a National Heritage.&lt;ref name=ratter /&gt; It is also home to the [[Guarani Aquifer]], stores the largest fresh water underground reservoirs in South America, and supplies water to a third of the Amazon river and the largest basins in the continent.&lt;ref name="e360.yale.edu"&gt;The Cerrado: Brazil's Other Biodiverse Region Loses Ground http://e360.yale.edu/features/the_cerrado_brazils_other_biodiversity_hotspot_loses_ground&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;DW –
 Secrets of the Brazilian Cerrado http://www.dw.com/en/secrets-of-the-brazilian-cerrado/a-37066253&lt;/ref&gt;

Brazilian agriculturalists and ministers regard it as it has no conservation value, and the government has protected merely 1.5% of the Cerrado biome in Federal Reserves.&lt;ref name=conservation /&gt; By 1994, an estimated 695,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;&lt;ref name=jenson /&gt; of cerrado (representing 35% of its area) had been converted to 'anthropic landscape'.&lt;ref name=oliveira /&gt; In total, 37.3% of the Cerrado has already been totally converted to human use, while an additional 41.4% is used for pasture and charcoal production. The gallery forests in the region have been among the most heavily affected. It is estimated that only about 432,814 km2, or 21.3% of the original vegetation, remains intact today.&lt;ref&gt;Conservation International. http://www.biodiversityhotspots.org/xp/hotspots/cerrado/pages/impacts.aspx{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} Access date: 31/08/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

During the last 25 years this biome has been increasingly threatened by industrial single-crop [[monoculture]] farming, particularly soybeans, the unregulated expansion of industrial agriculture, the burning of vegetation for [[charcoal]] and the development of dams to provide irrigation are drawing criticisms and have been identified as potential threats to several Brazilian rivers.&lt;ref name=criticisms&gt;{{cite news|first=Eric |last=Hilaire |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/audioslideshow/2011/dec/22/cerrado-brazil-audio-slideshow |title=Disappearing Cerrado: 'Brazil's great untold environmental disaster' – audio slideshow &amp;#124; Environment &amp;#124; guardian.co.uk |publisher=Guardian |date= December 22, 2011|accessdate=2011-12-22 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=jenson&gt;A Disappearing Biome? Reconsidering Land-Cover Change in the Brazilian Savanna Wendy Jepson, The Geographical Journal. Vol. 171, No. 2 (Jun., 2005), pp. 99–111&lt;/ref&gt;

This industrial farming of the Cerrado, with the clearing of land for Eucalyptus and Soya plantation, has grown so much because of various forms of subsidy, including very generous tax incentives and low interest loans, this has caused an enormous establishment of highly mechanized, capital intensive system of agriculture.&lt;ref name=klink&gt;Carlos Klink and Ricardo Machado (2005). "Conservation of the Brazilian Cerrado". ''Conservation Biology'', Volume 19 #3.&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a strong agribusiness lobby in Brazil and in particular, the production of soybeans in the Cerrado is influenced by large corporations such as ADM, Cargill and Bunge, these latter two directly associated with the mass deforestation of this biome.&lt;ref&gt;Mighty Earth –

One issue with expanding this reserve is that research needs to be done to choose the location of these reserves because the Cerrado biome is floristically very heterogeneous and constitutes a biological mosaic.&lt;ref name=jenson /&gt; Teams from the University of Brasília, CPAC and the Royal Botanic Garden Edinburgh have been collaborating on this project for a number of years funded by Brazilian, European Community and British funds. The project has recently been expanded into a major Anglo-Brazilian initiative, Conservation and Management of the Biodiversity of the Cerrado Biome, with UK Overseas Development Administration funding1. Its aim is to survey the floristic patterns of Cerrado vegetation and to discover representative areas and biodiversity `hot-spots'.&lt;ref name=ratter /&gt;

'''Chandradwip''' or '''Chandradvipa''' is a small region in [[Barisal District]], [[Bangladesh]]. It was once the ancient and medieval name of [[Barisal|Barishal]].

== History ==
ThehHistory of Chandradwip goes back to the Pre-Pala Period.

Chandradwip was successively ruled by the [[Mauryas]], [[Guptas]] and the [[Pala Empire|Palas]]. Towards the end of the 10th century A.D., the [[Chandra Dynasty]] gave this region a "distinct political identity."

The Chandras were succeeded by the [[Deva Dynasty]]. After a brief period of confusion, the Deva Dynasty occupied this region and established their capital at Kachua. They were followed by the Basu and Mitra Mazumdar families. During the latter's rule, Chandradwip was auctioned off.

Until the 18th century A.D., the [[Hindu]] rulers of Chandradwip were independent. After that this kingdom became a [[Zamindar]]i, while the greater part of Chandradwip was named Bakerganj after a Muslim adventurer, Bakar Khan.

Chandradwip was one of the Hindu Kingdoms that survived the Muslim Invasion and Conquest. The presence of mighty rivers and canals prevented the [[Muslim]]s from conquering this region. It maintained its independence under the Kayastha rulers.

The prosperity of this kingdom reached its zenith during the time of Kandarpanarayan Rai. Many Chinese and European travelers left interesting accounts about this kingdom. The earliest Chinese accounts describe this region as " a famous place for the worship of the Hindu-Bauddha-Tantrik deity Tara" The Temple of Tara was situated near the seashore. It was visible from the sea. [[Chandragomin]], the famous grammarian of the 6th century, wrote his hymns on Tara from this place. In a manuscript of 1015 A.D., the region of Chandradwip was mentioned with the Tara-Temple. It was there during the rule of the Chandra kings.

During the [[Mughal Empire|Mughal Period]], this region came to be known as Bakla-Chandradwip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

[[Rabindranath Tagore]] wrote ''Bou Thakuranir Haath,'' a famous book about the Basu Maharani of Chandradwip which was latter filmed as [[Bou Thakuranir Haat]].

'''Conrad Malte-Brun''' (12 August 1775{{snd}}14 December 1826), born '''Malthe Conrad Bruun''', and sometimes referred to simply as '''Malte-Brun''',&lt;ref name=ac&gt;{{Cite AmCyc|wstitle=Malte-Brun}}&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Danish people|Dano]]-[[French people|French]] [[geographer]] and journalist. His second son, [[Victor Adolphe Malte-Brun]], was also a geographer. Today he is perhaps best remembered for coining the name for the geographic region [[Oceania]] (French ''Océanie'') around 1812.

==Biography==
Born in [[Thisted]] to an administrator of Danish [[crown land]]s, Malte-Brun was originally destined for a career as a [[pastor]], but chose instead to attend classes at the [[University of Copenhagen]], and became a supporter of the [[French Revolution]] and an activist in favor of [[freedom of the press]]. Following the harsh censorship laws instituted by the Danish ruler crown prince [[Frederick VI of Denmark|Frederick]] in September 1799, he was indicted because of his many pamphlets which contained outright criticism of the government, which the new censorship laws forbade. A particular cause for offence was a pamphlet he published in 1795 entitled "Catechism of the Aristocrats."&lt;ref name=ac/&gt;

The case of [[Peter Andreas Heiberg]], who for similar crimes had been sentenced to [[exile]] at [[Christmas]] of 1799, did not make Malte-Brun optimistic about his prospects. He had already left the country prior to the court sentence (which was first carried late 1800) and had settled first in [[Sweden]], later in the [[Imperial Free City|Free City]] of [[Hamburg]].

At some point during his exile, he started using his [[:Category:Danish masculine given names|Danish first name]], [[Malthe]], [[Double-barrelled name#Scandinavia|as part of his surname]], [[Bruun]].

[[File:1837 Malte-Brun Map of China and Japan - Geographicus - China-mb-1837.jpg|thumb|left|An 1837 edition of a Malte-Brun Map of China. This is one of the earliest maps to use the term [[Manchuria]] (''Mandchourie''), which Conrad Malte-Brun and Mentelle promoted as early as 1804.&lt;ref&gt;«Les provinces tributaires du nord ou la Mantchourie, la Mongolie, la Kalmouquie, le Sifan, la Petit Bucharie, et autres pays vulgairement compris sous la fausse dénomination de TARTARIE», in: {{citation

|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=CghUAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA144|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Malte-Brun arrived in [[France]] in November 1799, and began work on a geography treatise meant as a gift to his adoptive country. A poem on the death of [[Andreas Peter Bernstorff]] which he published during his exile procured for him permission to return to Denmark. But another pamphlet against the aristocracy subjected him to a new prosecution, and he left his country, and finally took up his residence in Paris. In December 1800, the Danish courts pronounced sentence of perpetual banishment against him, which was rescinded about the time of his death.&lt;ref name=ac/&gt; Malte-Brun's geography treatise was written with the help of [[Edme Mentelle]], a professor at the [[École Normale Supérieure|École Normale]]; together, they produced ''Géographie mathématique, physique et politique de toutes les parties du monde'' (6 vols., published between 1803 and 1812).

He was a regular contributor to ''[[Journal des Débats]]''. He at first opposed the [[French Consulate|consular government]], but subsequently became a zealous [[First French Empire|imperialist]], and after the fall of [[Napoleon]] an equally zealous monarchist, publishing in 1824 ''Traité de la légitimité considérée comme base du droit public de l'Europe chrétienne''.&lt;ref name=ac/&gt;

Aside from his political writings, he devoted himself especially to geographical studies.&lt;ref name=ac/&gt; He was the founder of ''Les Annales des Voyages'' (in 1807) and ''Les Annales des Voyages, de la Géographie et de l'Histoire'' (in 1819), which encouraged observations and reports as a basis for research. He became well known after contributing ''Tableau de la Pologne'', a treatise on the geography of [[Poland]] (in 1807, as the [[First French Empire|First Empire]] troops [[Duchy of Warsaw|established French tutelage in the region]]). In 1822-1824, he served as the first general secretary of the newly founded ''[[Société de Géographie]]''. Malte-Brun was the first person to suggest importing [[camel]]s into [[Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;Conrad Malte-Brun, ''Universal Geography: Containing the description of India and Oceanica'', Volume III, Book LVI 'Oceanica', Part IV 'New Holland and its dependancies', p.568. Longman, Hurst, Rees, Orme and Brown, London 1822.&lt;/ref&gt; See [[Australian feral camel]].

He died in [[Paris]] in 1826, as he was drafting the final version of his major work, the ''Précis de Géographie Universelle ou Description de toutes les parties du monde''. This appeared in eight volumes (1810–29), the last two volumes being by [[Jean Jacques Nicolas Huot|Huot]].&lt;ref name=ac/&gt; Malte-Brun's name was given to streets in both Paris ([[20th arrondissement]]) and Thisted.

[[File:Dioptra-principe.jpg|right|thumb|384px|Three stages in the evolution of the dioptra, from a simple horizontal sight, to a multi-angle measuring tool]]
A '''dioptra''' (sometimes also named '''dioptre''' or '''diopter''' from {{lang-el|διόπτρα}}) is a [[Hellenistic civilization|classical]] astronomical and [[surveying instrument]], dating from the 3rd&amp;nbsp;century BCE. The '''dioptra''' was a sighting tube or, alternatively, a rod with a sight at both ends, attached to a stand. If fitted with [[protractor]]s, it could be used to measure [[angle]]s.

==Use==
[[Greek astronomy|Greek astronomers]] used the dioptra to [[astrometry|measure the positions of stars]]; both [[Euclid]] and [[Geminus]] refer to the dioptra in their astronomical works. By the time of [[Ptolemy]] (2nd&amp;nbsp;century CE), it was obsolete as an astronomical instrument, having been replaced by the [[armillary sphere]].

It continued in use as an effective [[surveying]] tool. Adapted to surveying, the dioptra is similar to the [[theodolite]], or surveyor's transit, which dates to the sixteenth century. It is a more accurate version of the [[Groma surveying|groma]].

The dioptra may have been sophisticated enough, for example, to construct a tunnel through two opposite points in a mountain. There is some speculation that it may have been used to build the [[Eupalinian aqueduct]]. Called "one of the greatest engineering achievements of ancient times," it is a tunnel 1,036&amp;nbsp;meters (4,000&amp;nbsp;ft) long, "excavated through [[Mount Kastro]] on the Greek island of [[Samos Island|Samos]], in the 6th century BCE" during the reign of [[Polycrates]].  Scholars disagree whether the dioptra was available that early.&lt;ref name=Apostol&gt;{{cite web|last=Apostol|first=Tom M.|title=The Tunnel of Samos|url=http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/4106/1/Samos.pdf|publisher=caltech.edu|accessdate=19 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An entire book about the construction and surveying usage of the dioptra is credited to [[Hero of Alexandria]] (also known as Heron; a brief description of the book is available online; see Lahanas link, below). Hero was "one of history’s most ingenious [[engineer]]s and applied [[mathematician]]s."

The dioptra was used extensively on [[aqueduct (water supply)|aqueduct]] building projects. Screw turns on several different parts of the instrument made it easy to calibrate for very precise measurements

The dioptra was replaced as a surveying instrument by the [[theodolite]].

The '''Elwak–Mandera Road''', is a rural road in Kenya. The road links [[El Wak, Kenya|Elwak]], to the town of [[Mandera]], in the country's extreme northeast, near the tri-point where the borders of [[Kenya]], [[Ethiopia]] and [[Somalia]] meet.

==Location==
The road starts at [[El Wak, Kenya|Elwak]], [[Mandera County]], at the border with the town of [[El Wak, Somalia]]. It travels in a general northerly direction through a village called ''Warankara'', continuing north to the town of [[Rhamu]], at the border with Ethiopia, a distance of approximately {{convert|143|km|mi}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|accessdate=1 April 2016|last=GFC |

==Overview==
This road is an important transport corridor for traffic from [[Mombasa]] and [[Nairobi]] destined for Mandera. It also facilitates trade between Kenya and her neighbors to the north and northeast; Ethiopia and Somalia respectively. Travel along this road, although safer compared to a shorter route through [[Lafey]], is longer in distance and bumpier, due to the rough condition of the road.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wardheernews.com/mandera-residents-living-in-fear-of-al-shabaab/|title=Mandera Residents Living In Fear of Al-Shabaab|accessdate=1 April 2016|date=11 June 2013 |first=Muchemi |

The '''analysis of errors computed using the [[Global Positioning System]]''' is important for understanding how GPS works, and for knowing what magnitude of errors should be expected. The Global Positioning System makes corrections for receiver clock errors and other effects but there are still residual errors which are not corrected. The Global Positioning System (GPS) was created by the United States Department of Defense (DOD) in the 1970s. It has come to be widely used for navigation both by the U.S. military and the general public.

GPS receiver position is computed based on data received from the satellites. Errors depend on geometric dilution of precision and the sources listed in the table below.

[[File:Gps error diagram.svg|thumb|left| 300px|Geometric Error Diagram Showing Typical Relation of Indicated Receiver Position, Intersection of Sphere Surfaces, and True Receiver Position in Terms of Pseudorange Errors, PDOP, and Numerical Errors]]
User equivalent range errors (UERE) are shown in the table. There is also a [[numerical error]] with an estimated value, &lt;math&gt;\ \sigma_{num} &lt;/math&gt;, of about 1 meter. The standard deviations, &lt;math&gt;\ \sigma_R&lt;/math&gt;, for the coarse/acquisition (C/A) and precise codes are also shown in the table. These standard deviations are computed by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual components (i.e., RSS for root sum squares). To get the standard deviation of receiver position estimate, these range errors must be multiplied by the appropriate [[Dilution of precision (GPS)|dilution of precision]] terms and then RSS'ed with the numerical error. Electronics errors are one of several accuracy-degrading effects outlined in the table above. When taken together, autonomous civilian GPS horizontal position fixes are typically accurate to about 15 meters (50&amp;nbsp;ft). These effects also reduce the more precise P(Y) code's accuracy. However, the advancement of technology means that in the present, civilian GPS fixes under a clear view of the sky are on average accurate to about 5 meters (16&amp;nbsp;ft) horizontally.

The term user equivalent range error (UERE) refers to the error of a component in the distance from receiver to a satellite. These UERE errors are given as ± errors thereby implying that they are unbiased or zero mean errors. These UERE errors are therefore used in computing standard deviations. The standard deviation of the error in receiver position,
&lt;math&gt;\ \sigma_{rc}&lt;/math&gt;, is computed by multiplying PDOP (Position Dilution Of Precision) by
&lt;math&gt;\ \sigma_R&lt;/math&gt;, the standard deviation of the user equivalent range errors.
&lt;math&gt;\ \sigma_R&lt;/math&gt; is computed by taking the square root of the sum of the squares of the individual component standard deviations.

PDOP is computed as a function of receiver and satellite positions. A detailed description of how to calculate PDOP is given in the section, geometric dilution of precision computation (GDOP).

&lt;math&gt;\ \sigma_R&lt;/math&gt; for the C/A code is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;3\sigma_R= \sqrt{3^2+5^2+2.5^2+2^2+1^2+0.5^2} \, \mathrm{m} \,=\,6.7 \, \mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt;

The standard deviation of the error in estimated receiver position &lt;math&gt;\ \sigma_{rc}&lt;/math&gt;, again for the C/A code is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;\ \sigma_{rc} = \sqrt{PDOP^2 \times \sigma_R^2 + \sigma_{num}^2} = \sqrt{PDOP^2 \times 2.2^2 + 1^2} \, \mathrm{m}&lt;/math&gt;

The error diagram on the left shows the inter relationship of indicated receiver position, true receiver position, and the intersection of the four sphere surfaces.

== Signal arrival time measurement ==
The position calculated by a GPS receiver requires the current time, the position of the satellite and the measured delay of the received signal. The position accuracy is primarily dependent on the satellite position and signal delay.

To measure the delay, the receiver compares the bit sequence received from the satellite with an internally generated version. By comparing the rising and trailing edges of the bit transitions, modern electronics can measure signal offset to within about one percent of a bit pulse width, &lt;math&gt;\frac{0.01 \times 300,000,000 m/s}{(1.023 \times 10^6 /\mathrm{s})}&lt;/math&gt;, or approximately 10 nanoseconds for the C/A code. Since GPS signals propagate at the [[speed of light]], this represents an error of about 3 meters.

This component of position accuracy can be improved by a factor of 10 using the higher-chiprate P(Y) signal. Assuming the same one percent of bit pulse width accuracy, the high-frequency P(Y) signal results in an accuracy of &lt;math&gt;\frac {(0.01 \times 300,000,000\ \mathrm{m/s})} {(10.23 \times 10^6 / \mathrm{s})}&lt;/math&gt; or about 30 centimeters.

== Atmospheric effects ==
Inconsistencies of atmospheric conditions affect the speed of the GPS signals as they pass through the [[Earth's atmosphere]], especially the ionosphere. Correcting these errors is a significant challenge to improving GPS position accuracy. These effects are smallest when the satellite is directly overhead and become greater for satellites nearer the [[horizon]] since the path through the atmosphere is longer (see [[airmass]]). Once the receiver's approximate location is known, a mathematical model can be used to estimate and compensate for these errors.

{{anchor|Ionospheric delay}}
'''Ionospheric delay''' of a microwave signal depends on its frequency. It arises from ionized atmosphere (see [[Total electron content]]). This phenomenon is known as [[dispersion (optics)|dispersion]] and can be calculated from measurements of delays for two or more frequency bands, allowing delays at other frequencies to be estimated.&lt;ref&gt;The same principle, and the math behind it, can be found in descriptions of [[Dispersion measure|pulsar timing by astronomers]].&lt;/ref&gt; Some military and expensive survey-grade civilian receivers calculate atmospheric dispersion from the different delays in the L1 and L2 frequencies, and apply a more precise correction. This can be done in civilian receivers without decrypting the P(Y) signal carried on L2, by tracking the [[carrier wave]] instead of the [[modulation|modulated]] code. To facilitate this on lower cost receivers, a new civilian code signal on L2, called L2C, was added to the Block IIR-M satellites, which was first launched in 2005. It allows a direct comparison of the L1 and L2 signals using the coded signal instead of the carrier wave.

The effects of the ionosphere generally change slowly, and can be averaged over time. Those for any particular geographical area can be easily calculated by comparing the GPS-measured position to a known surveyed location. This correction is also valid for other receivers in the same general location. Several systems send this information over radio or other links to allow L1-only receivers to make ionospheric corrections. The ionospheric data are transmitted via satellite in [[Satellite Based Augmentation System]]s (SBAS) such as [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS) (available in North America and Hawaii), [[EGNOS]] (Europe and Asia) or [[Multi-functional Satellite Augmentation System]] (MSAS) (Japan), which transmits it on the GPS frequency using a special pseudo-random noise sequence (PRN), so only one receiver and antenna are required.

[[Humidity]] also causes a variable delay, resulting in errors similar to ionospheric delay, but occurring in the [[troposphere]]. This effect is more localized than ionospheric effects, changes more quickly and is not frequency dependent. These traits make precise measurement and compensation of humidity errors more difficult than ionospheric effects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navipedia.net/index.php/Earth_Sciences#Troposphere_Monitoring Navipedia: Troposphere Monitoring]&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Atmospheric pressure]] can also change the signals reception delay, due to the dry gases present at the troposphere (78% N2, 21% O2, 0.9% Ar...). Its effect varies with local temperature and atmospheric pressure in quite a predictable manner using the laws of the ideal gases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navipedia.net/index.php/Tropospheric_Delay Navipedia: Tropospheric Delay]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Multipath effects ==
GPS signals can also be affected by [[multipath interference|multipath]] issues, where the radio signals reflect off surrounding terrain; buildings, canyon walls, hard ground, etc. These delayed signals cause measurement errors that are different for each type of GPS signal due to its dependency on the wavelength.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.navipedia.net/index.php/Multipath Navipedia: Multipath]&lt;/ref&gt;

A variety of techniques, most notably narrow correlator spacing, have been developed to mitigate multipath errors. For long delay multipath, the receiver itself can recognize the wayward signal and discard it. To address shorter delay multipath from the signal reflecting off the ground, specialized antennas (e.g., a [[choke ring antenna]]) may be used to reduce the signal power as received by the antenna. Short delay reflections are harder to filter out because they interfere with the true signal, causing effects almost indistinguishable from routine fluctuations in atmospheric delay.

Multipath effects are much less severe in moving vehicles. When the GPS antenna is moving, the false solutions using reflected signals quickly fail to converge and only the direct signals result in stable solutions.

== Ephemeris and clock errors ==
While the [[ephemeris]] data is transmitted every 30 seconds, the information itself may be up to two hours old. Variability in solar radiation pressure&lt;ref&gt;[http://ipnpr.jpl.nasa.gov/progress_report/42-159/159I.pdf ''IPN Progress Report'' 42-159 (2004)]&lt;/ref&gt; has an indirect effect on GPS accuracy due to its effect on ephemeris errors. If a fast [[time to first fix]] (TTFF) is needed, it is possible to upload a valid ephemeris to a receiver, and in addition to setting the time, a position fix can be obtained in under ten seconds. It is feasible to put such ephemeris data on the web so it can be loaded into mobile GPS devices.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=SNT080408 |url=http://www.tdc.co.uk/index.php?key=ephemeris |title=Ephemeris Server Example |publisher=Tdc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2009-10-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090112033511/http://www.tdc.co.uk/index.php?key=ephemeris |archivedate=January 12, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; See also [[Assisted GPS]].

The satellites' atomic clocks experience noise and [[clock drift]] errors. The navigation message contains corrections for these errors and estimates of the accuracy of the atomic clock. However, they are based on observations and may not indicate the clock's current state.

These problems tend to be very small, but may add up to a few meters (tens of feet) of inaccuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://seismo.berkeley.edu/~battag/GAMITwrkshp/lecturenotes/unit1/unit1.html#3 |title=Unit 1 – Introduction to GPS |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090429034807/http://seismo.berkeley.edu/~battag/GAMITwrkshp/lecturenotes/unit1/unit1.html |archivedate=April 29, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

For very precise positioning (e.g., in [[geodesy]]), these effects can be eliminated by [[differential GPS]]: the simultaneous use of two or more receivers at several [[Benchmark (surveying)|survey points]]. In the 1990s when receivers were quite expensive, some methods of ''quasi-differential'' GPS were developed, using only ''one'' receiver but reoccupation of measuring points. At the TU Vienna the method was named ''qGPS'' and post processing software was developed.{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}}

== Geometric dilution of precision computation (GDOP) {{anchor|gdop}} ==
{{main article|Dilution of precision (GPS)}}

=== Computation of geometric dilution of precision ===
The concept of geometric dilution of precision was introduced in the section, ''error sources and analysis''. Computations were provided to show how PDOP was used and how it affected the receiver position error standard deviation.

When visible GPS satellites are close together in the sky (i.e., small angular separation), the DOP values are high; when far apart, the DOP values are low. Conceptually, satellites that are close together cannot provide as much information as satellites that are widely separated. Low DOP values represent a better GPS positional accuracy due to the wider angular separation between the satellites used to calculate GPS receiver position. HDOP, VDOP, PDOP and TDOP are respectively Horizontal, Vertical, Position (3-D) and Time Dilution of Precision.

Figure 3.1 Dilution of Precision of Navstar GPS data from the U.S. Coast Guard provide a graphical indication of how geometry affect accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

We now take on the task of how to compute the dilution of precision terms. As a first step in computing DOP, consider the unit vector from the receiver to satellite i with components &lt;math&gt;\frac{(x_i- x)}{R_i}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\frac {(y_i-y)}{R_i}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\frac {(z_i-z)}{R_i}&lt;/math&gt; where the distance from receiver to the satellite, &lt;math&gt;\ R_i &lt;/math&gt;, is given by:
:&lt;math&gt;R_i\,=\,\sqrt{(x_i- x)^2 + (y_i-y)^2 + (z_i-z)^2}&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;\ x, y,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ z&lt;/math&gt; denote the position of the receiver and &lt;math&gt;\ x_i, y_i,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ z_i&lt;/math&gt; denote the position of satellite ''i''. These ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' components may be components in a North, East, Down coordinate system a South, East, Up coordinate system or other convenient system. Formulate the matrix ''A'' as:
:&lt;math&gt;A = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac {(x_1- x)} {R_1} &amp; \frac {(y_1-y)} {R_1} &amp; \frac {(z_1-z)} {R_1} &amp; 1 \\
\frac {(x_2- x)} {R_2} &amp; \frac {(y_2-y)} {R_2} &amp; \frac {(z_2-z)} {R_2} &amp; 1 \\
\frac {(x_3- x)} {R_3} &amp; \frac {(y_3-y)} {R_3} &amp; \frac {(z_3-z)} {R_3} &amp; 1 \\
\frac {(x_4- x)} {R_4} &amp; \frac {(y_4-y)} {R_4} &amp; \frac {(z_4-z)} {R_4} &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}&lt;/math&gt;

The first three elements of each row of ''A'' are the components of a unit vector from the receiver to the indicated satellite. The elements in the fourth column are c where c denotes the speed of light. Formulate the matrix, ''Q'', as
:&lt;math&gt; Q = \left (A^T A \right )^{-1}
&lt;/math&gt;

This computation is in accordance with Chapter 11 of The global positioning system by Parkinson and Spilker where the weighting matrix, ''P'', has been set to the identity matrix. The elements of the ''Q'' matrix are designated as:&lt;ref&gt;Parkinson (1996)&lt;/ref&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;Q = 
\begin{bmatrix}
d_x^2    &amp; d_{xy}^2 &amp; d_{xz}^2 &amp; d_{xt}^2 \\
d_{xy}^2 &amp; d_{y}^2  &amp; d_{yz}^2 &amp; d_{yt}^2 \\
d_{xz}^2 &amp; d_{yz}^2 &amp; d_{z}^2 &amp; d_{zt}^2 \\
d_{xt}^2 &amp; d_{yt}^2 &amp; d_{zt}^2 &amp; d_{t}^2
\end{bmatrix}
&lt;/math&gt;

The Greek letter &lt;math&gt;\ \sigma&lt;/math&gt; is used quite often where we have used ''d''. However the elements of the ''Q'' matrix do not represent variances and covariances as they are defined in probability and statistics. Instead they are strictly geometric terms. Therefore, d as in dilution of precision is used. PDOP, TDOP and GDOP are given by
:&lt;math&gt;\begin{align}
  PDOP &amp;= \sqrt{d_x^2 + d_y^2 + d_z^2} \\
  TDOP &amp;= \sqrt{d_{t}^2} = |d_{t}| \\
  GDOP &amp;= \sqrt{PDOP^2 + TDOP^2}
\end{align}&lt;/math&gt;

in agreement with [https://web.archive.org/web/20141122153439/http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap1/149.htm "Section 1.4.9 of PRINCIPLES OF SATELLITE POSITIONING"].

The horizontal dilution of precision, &lt;math&gt; HDOP = \sqrt{d_x^2 + d_y^2}&lt;/math&gt;, and the vertical dilution of precision, &lt;math&gt;\ VDOP = \sqrt{d_{z}^2} = |d_z|&lt;/math&gt;, are both dependent on the coordinate system used. To correspond to the local horizon plane and the local vertical, ''x'', ''y'', and ''z'' should denote positions in either a North, East, Down coordinate system or a South, East, Up coordinate system.

=== Derivation of equations for computing geometric dilution of precision ===
The equations for computing the geometric dilution of precision terms have been described in the previous section. This section describes the derivation of these equations. The method used here is similar to that used in [https://books.google.com/books?id=lvI1a5J_4ewC&amp;pg=PA474 "Global Positioning System (preview) by Parkinson and Spiker"]

Consider the position error vector, &lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e}&lt;/math&gt;, defined as the vector from the intersection of the four sphere surfaces corresponding to the pseudoranges to the true position of the receiver.&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{e} = e_x\hat{x} + e_y\hat{y} + e_z\hat{z} &lt;/math&gt; where bold denotes a vector and &lt;math&gt;\hat{x}&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;\hat{y}&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;\hat{z}&lt;/math&gt; denote unit vectors along the x, y, and z axes respectively. Let &lt;math&gt;\ e_t&lt;/math&gt; denote the time error, the true time minus the receiver indicated time. Assume that the mean value of the three components of &lt;math&gt;\mathbf {e}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;\ e_t&lt;/math&gt; are zero.

:&lt;math&gt;A
\begin{bmatrix}
e_x \\ e_y \\ e_z \\ e_t
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
\frac {(x_1- x)} {R_1} &amp; \frac {(y_1-y)} {R_1} &amp; \frac {(z_1-z)} {R_1} &amp; 1 \\
\frac {(x_2- x)} {R_2} &amp; \frac {(y_2-y)} {R_2} &amp; \frac {(z_2-z)} {R_2} &amp; 1 \\
\frac {(x_3- x)} {R_3} &amp; \frac {(y_3-y)} {R_3} &amp; \frac {(z_3-z)} {R_3} &amp; 1 \\
\frac {(x_4- x)} {R_4} &amp; \frac {(y_4-y)} {R_4} &amp; \frac {(z_4-z)} {R_4} &amp; 1
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
e_x \\ e_y \\ e_z \\ e_t
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
e_1 \\ e_2 \\ e_3 \\ e_4
\end{bmatrix}
\ (1)&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;e_1&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e_2&lt;/math&gt;, &lt;math&gt;e_3&lt;/math&gt;, and &lt;math&gt;e_4&lt;/math&gt; are the errors in pseudoranges 1 through 4 respectively. This equation comes from linearizing [[Global Positioning System#Multidimensional Newton-Raphson calculations|the Newton-Raphson equation]] relating pseudoranges to receiver position, satellite positions, and receiver clock errors. Multiplying both sides by &lt;math&gt;A^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; there results
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
e_x \\ e_y \\ e_z \\ e_t
\end{bmatrix} = 
A^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix}
e_1 \\ e_2 \\ e_3 \\ e_4
\end{bmatrix} \ (2)&lt;/math&gt; .

Transposing both sides:
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
e_x &amp; e_y &amp; e_z &amp; e_t
\end{bmatrix} = 
\begin{bmatrix}
e_1 &amp; e_2 &amp; e_3 &amp; e_4
\end{bmatrix}\left (A^{-1} \right )^T \ (3)&lt;/math&gt; .
Post multiplying the matrices on both sides of equation (2) by the corresponding matrices in equation (3), there results
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
e_x \\ e_y \\ e_z \\ e_t
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
e_x &amp; e_y &amp; e_z &amp; e_t
\end{bmatrix} = 
A^{-1}
\begin{bmatrix}
e_1 \\ e_2 \\ e_3 \\ e_4
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
e_1 &amp; e_2 &amp; e_3 &amp; e_4
\end{bmatrix}\left (A^{-1} \right )^T \ (4)
&lt;/math&gt; .

Taking the expected value of both sides and taking the non-random matrices outside the expectation operator, E, there results:
:&lt;math&gt;E
\left (\begin{bmatrix}
e_x \\ e_y \\ e_z \\ e_t
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
e_x &amp; e_y &amp; e_z &amp; e_t
\end{bmatrix} \right ) = 
A^{-1} E
\left (\begin{bmatrix}
e_1 \\ e_2 \\ e_3 \\ e_4
\end{bmatrix}
\begin{bmatrix}
e_1 &amp; e_2 &amp; e_3 &amp; e_4
\end{bmatrix} \right )
\left (A^{-1} \right )^T \ (5)
&lt;/math&gt;
Assuming the pseudorange errors are uncorrelated and have the same variance, the covariance matrix on the right side can be expressed as a scalar times the identity matrix. Thus

:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_x^2    &amp; \sigma_{xy}^2 &amp; \sigma_{xz}^2 &amp; \sigma_{xt}^2 \\
\sigma_{xy}^2 &amp; \sigma_{y}^2  &amp; \sigma_{yz}^2 &amp; \sigma_{yt}^2 \\
\sigma_{xz}^2 &amp; \sigma_{yz}^2 &amp; \sigma_{z}^2 &amp; \sigma_{zt}^2 \\
\sigma_{xt}^2 &amp; \sigma_{yt}^2 &amp; \sigma_{zt}^2 &amp; \sigma_{t}^2
\end{bmatrix} = \sigma_R^2 \ A^{-1} \left (A^{-1} \right )^T = 
\sigma_R^2 \ \left (A^T A \right )^{-1} \ (6)&lt;/math&gt;
since &lt;math&gt;\ A^{-1} \left (A^{-1} \right )^T \left (A^T A \right ) = I &lt;/math&gt;

Note: &lt;math&gt;\left( A^{-1} \right)^T = \left( A^{T} \right)^{-1},&lt;/math&gt; since &lt;math&gt;I = \left( A A^{-1} \right)^T = \left( A^{-1}\right)^T A^T&lt;/math&gt;

Substituting for &lt;math&gt;\left( A^T A \right)^{-1} = Q&lt;/math&gt; there follows
:&lt;math&gt;
\begin{bmatrix}
\sigma_x^2    &amp; \sigma_{xy}^2 &amp; \sigma_{xz}^2 &amp; \sigma_{xt}^2 \\
\sigma_{xy}^2 &amp; \sigma_{y}^2  &amp; \sigma_{yz}^2 &amp; \sigma_{yt}^2 \\
\sigma_{xz}^2 &amp; \sigma_{yz}^2 &amp; \sigma_{z}^2 &amp; \sigma_{zt}^2 \\
\sigma_{xt}^2 &amp; \sigma_{yt}^2 &amp; \sigma_{zt}^2 &amp; \sigma_{t}^2
\end{bmatrix}  = \sigma_R^2
\begin{bmatrix}
d_x^2    &amp; d_{xy}^2 &amp; d_{xz}^2 &amp; d_{xt}^2 \\
d_{xy}^2 &amp; d_{y}^2  &amp; d_{yz}^2 &amp; d_{yt}^2 \\
d_{xz}^2 &amp; d_{yz}^2 &amp; d_{z}^2 &amp; d_{zt}^2 \\
d_{xt}^2 &amp; d_{yt}^2 &amp; d_{zt}^2 &amp; d_{t}^2
\end{bmatrix} \ (7)
&lt;/math&gt;

From equation (7), it follows that the variances of indicated receiver position and time are
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_{rc}^2 = \sigma_x^2 + \sigma_y^2 + \sigma_z^2 = \sigma_R^2\left(d_x^2 + d_y^2 + d_z^2\right) = PDOP^2 \sigma_R^2&lt;/math&gt; and
:&lt;math&gt;\sigma_t^2 = \sigma_R^2 d_t^2 = TDOP^2 \sigma_R^2&lt;/math&gt;

The remaining position and time error variance terms follow in a straightforward manner.

== Selective availability ==
GPS included a (currently disabled) feature called ''Selective Availability'' (''SA'') that adds intentional, time varying errors of up to 100 meters (328&amp;nbsp;ft) to the publicly available navigation signals. This was intended to deny an enemy the use of civilian GPS receivers for precision weapon guidance.

SA errors are actually pseudorandom, generated by a cryptographic algorithm from a classified ''seed'' [[key (cryptography)|key]] available only to authorized users (the U.S. military, its allies and a few other users, mostly government) with a special military GPS receiver. Mere possession of the receiver is insufficient; it still needs the tightly controlled daily key.

Before it was turned off on May 2, 2000, typical SA errors were about 50&amp;nbsp;m (164&amp;nbsp;ft) horizontally and about 100&amp;nbsp;m (328&amp;nbsp;ft) vertically.&lt;ref&gt;Grewal (2001), p. 103.&lt;/ref&gt; Because SA affects every GPS receiver in a given area almost equally, a fixed station with an accurately known position can measure the SA error values and transmit them to the local GPS receivers so they may correct their position fixes. This is called Differential GPS or ''DGPS''. [[Differential GPS|DGPS]] also corrects for several other important sources of GPS errors, particularly ionospheric delay, so it continues to be widely used even though SA has been turned off. The ineffectiveness of SA in the face of widely available DGPS was a common argument for turning off SA, and this was finally done by order of President [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]] in 2000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://clintonwhitehouse4.archives.gov/WH/EOP/OSTP/html/0053.html |title=President Clinton Orders the Cessation of GPS Selective Availability |archivedate=2000-05-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

DGPS services are widely available from both commercial and government sources. The latter include WAAS and the [[US Coast Guard|U.S. Coast Guard's]] network of [[Low frequency|LF]] marine navigation beacons. The accuracy of the corrections depends on the distance between the user and the DGPS receiver. As the distance increases, the errors at the two sites will not correlate as well, resulting in less precise differential corrections.

During the 1990–91 [[Gulf War]], the shortage of military GPS units caused many troops and their families to buy readily available civilian units. Selective Availability significantly impeded the U.S. military's own battlefield use of these GPS, so the military made the decision to turn it off for the duration of the war.

In the 1990s, the [[Federal Aviation Administration|FAA]] started pressuring the military to turn off SA permanently. This would save the FAA millions of dollars every year in maintenance of their own [[radio navigation]] systems. The amount of error added was "set to zero"&lt;ref name="OSTP"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.faa.gov/about/office_org/headquarters_offices/ato/service_units/techops/navservices/gnss/gps/policy/presidential/index.cfm?print=go#1|publisher=[[Federal Aviation Administration]]|title=Statement by the President regarding the United States' Decision to Stop Degrading Global Positioning System Accuracy|date=May 1, 2000|accessdate=2013-01-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; at midnight on May 1, 2000 following an announcement by U.S. President [[Bill Clinton]], allowing users access to the error-free L1 signal. Per the directive, the induced error of SA was changed to add no error to the public signals (C/A code). Clinton's executive order required SA to be set to zero by 2006; it happened in 2000 once the U.S. military developed a new system that provides the ability to deny GPS (and other navigation services) to hostile forces in a specific area of crisis without affecting the rest of the world or its own military systems.&lt;ref name="OSTP" /&gt;

On 19 September 2007, the [[United States Department of Defense]] announced that future [[GPS modernization|GPS III]] satellites will not be capable of implementing SA,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=11335 |title=DoD Permanently Discontinues Procurement Of Global Positioning System Selective Availability |publisher=DefenseLink |date=September 18, 2007 |accessdate=2008-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080218050849/http://www.defenselink.mil/releases/release.aspx?releaseid=11335 |archivedate=February 18, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; eventually making the policy permanent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pnt.gov/public/sa/ |title=Selective Availability |publisher=National space-based Positioning, Navigation, and Timing Executive Committee |accessdate=2008-02-20 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080113123316/http://pnt.gov/public/sa/ |archivedate=January 13, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Anti-spoofing ==
{{see also|GPS signals#Precision code}}
Another restriction on GPS, antispoofing, remains on. This encrypts the ''P-code'' so that it cannot be mimicked by a transmitter sending false information. Few civilian receivers have ever used the P-code, and the accuracy attainable with the public C/A&amp;nbsp;code was much better than originally expected (especially with [[Differential GPS|DGPS]]). So much so that the antispoof policy has relatively little effect on most civilian users. Turning off antispoof would primarily benefit surveyors and some scientists who need extremely precise positions for experiments such as tracking tectonic plate motion.

== Relativity ==
[[File:Orbit times.svg|thumb|right|Satellite clocks are slowed by their orbital speed but sped up by their distance out of the Earth's gravitational well.]]
A number of sources of error exist due to [[Theory of relativity|relativistic]] effects&lt;ref name=errors&gt;Webb (2004), p. 32.&lt;/ref&gt; that would render the system useless if uncorrected. Three relativistic effects are the time dilation, gravitational frequency shift, and eccentricity effects. Examples include the relativistic time ''slowing'' due to the speed of the satellite of about 1 part in 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;, the gravitational time dilation that makes a satellite run about 5 parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt; ''faster'' than an Earth-based clock, and the [[Sagnac effect]] due to rotation relative to receivers on Earth. These topics are examined below, one at a time.

=== Special and general relativity ===
According to the theory of relativity, due to their constant movement and height relative to the Earth-centered, non-rotating approximately inertial [[special relativity#Reference frames, coordinates and the Lorentz transformation|reference frame]], the clocks on the satellites are affected by their speed. [[Special relativity]] predicts that the frequency of the atomic clocks moving at GPS orbital speeds will tick more slowly than stationary ground clocks by a factor of &lt;math&gt;\frac{v^{2}}{2c^{2}}\approx 10 ^{-10}&lt;/math&gt;, or result in a delay of about 7 μs/day, where the orbital velocity is v = 4&amp;nbsp;km/s, and c = the speed of light. The [[time dilation]] effect has been measured and verified using the GPS.

The effect of gravitational frequency shift on the GPS due to [[general relativity]] is that a clock closer to a massive object will be slower than a clock farther away. Applied to the GPS, the receivers are much closer to Earth than the satellites, causing the GPS clocks to be faster by a factor of 5×10^(−10), or about 45.9 μs/day. This gravitational frequency shift is noticeable.

When combining the time dilation and gravitational frequency shift, the discrepancy is about 38 microseconds per day, a difference of 4.465 parts in 10&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name=Rizos&gt;Rizos, Chris. [[University of New South Wales]]. [http://www.gmat.unsw.edu.au/snap/gps/gps_survey/chap3/312.htm GPS Satellite Signals]. 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Without correction, errors in the initial pseudorange of roughly 10&amp;nbsp;km/day would accumulate. This initial pseudorange error is corrected in the process of solving the [[GPS#Navigation equations|navigation equations]]. In addition the elliptical, rather than perfectly circular, satellite orbits cause the time dilation and gravitational frequency shift effects to vary with time. This eccentricity effect causes the clock rate difference between a GPS satellite and a receiver to increase or decrease depending on the altitude of the satellite.

To compensate for the discrepancy, the frequency standard on board each satellite is given a rate offset prior to launch, making it run slightly slower than the desired frequency on Earth; specifically, at 10.22999999543&amp;nbsp;MHz instead of 10.23&amp;nbsp;MHz.&lt;ref name=Nelson&gt;[http://www.aticourses.com/global_positioning_system.htm The Global Positioning System by Robert A. Nelson Via Satellite], November 1999&lt;/ref&gt; Since the atomic clocks on board the GPS satellites are precisely tuned, it makes the system a practical engineering application of the scientific theory of relativity in a real-world environment.&lt;ref&gt;Pogge, Richard W.; [http://www.astronomy.ohio-state.edu/~pogge/Ast162/Unit5/gps.html "Real-World Relativity: The GPS Navigation System"]. Retrieved 25 January 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; Placing atomic clocks on artificial satellites to test Einstein's general theory was proposed by [[Friedwardt Winterberg]] in 1955.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bourabai.kz/winter/satelliten.htm |title=Astronautica Acta II, 25 (1956). |date=1956-08-10 |accessdate=2009-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Calculation of time dilation ===

To calculate the amount of daily time dilation experienced by GPS satellites relative to Earth we need to separately determine the amounts due to [[special relativity]] (velocity) and [[general relativity]] (gravity) and add them together.

The amount due to velocity will be determined using the [[Lorentz transformation]]. This will be:
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\gamma } = \sqrt{1-\frac{v^2}{c^2}} &lt;/math&gt;
For small values of ''v/c'', by using [[binomial expansion]] this approximates to:
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\gamma } \approx 1-\frac{v^2}{2 c^2} &lt;/math&gt;

The GPS satellites move at {{val|3874|u=m/s}} relative to Earth's center.&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt; We thus determine:
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\gamma } \approx 1-\frac{3874^2}{2 \left(2.998\times 10^8\right)^2} \approx 1-8.349\times 10^{-11} &lt;/math&gt;
This difference below 1 of {{val|8.349|e=-11}} represents the fraction by which the satellites' clocks move slower than Earth's. It is then multiplied by the number of nanoseconds in a day:
: &lt;math&gt; -8.349\times 10^{-11}\times 60\times 60\times 24\times 10^9\approx -7214 \text{ ns} &lt;/math&gt;

That is, the satellites' clocks lose 7,214 nanoseconds a day due to [[special relativity]] effects.

: Note that this speed of {{val|3874|u=m/s}} is measured relative to Earth's center rather than its surface where the GPS receivers (and users) are. This is because Earth's equipotential makes net time dilation equal across its geodesic surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.phys.unsw.edu.au/einsteinlight/jw/2006AJP.pdf | title = The equivalence principle as a stepping stone from special to general relativity | author = S. P. Drake | work = Am. J. Phys., Vol. 74, No. 1|pages= 22–25|date=January 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; That is, the combination of Special and General effects make the net time dilation at the equator equal to that of the poles, which in turn are at rest relative to the center. Hence we use the center as a reference point to represent the entire surface.

The amount of dilation due to gravity will be determined using the [[gravitational time dilation]] equation:
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\gamma } =\sqrt{1-\frac{2G M}{r c^2}} &lt;/math&gt;

For small values of ''M/r'', by using [[binomial expansion]] this approximates to:
: &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{\gamma } \approx 1-\frac{G M}{r c^2} &lt;/math&gt;

We are again only interested in the fraction below 1, and in the difference between Earth and the satellites. To determine this difference we take:
: &lt;math&gt; \Delta \left(\frac{1}{\gamma }\right) \approx \frac{G M_{\text{earth}}}{R_{\text{earth}} c^2}-\frac{G M_{\text{earth}}}{R_{\text{gps}} c^2} &lt;/math&gt;

Earth has a radius of 6,357&amp;nbsp;km (at the poles) making ''R&lt;sub&gt;earth&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 6,357,000 m and the satellites have an altitude of 20,184&amp;nbsp;km&lt;ref name="Nelson"/&gt; making their orbit radius ''R&lt;sub&gt;gps&lt;/sub&gt;'' = 26,541,000 m. Substituting these in the above equation, with ''M&lt;sub&gt;earth&lt;/sub&gt;'' = {{val|5.974|e=24}}, ''G'' = {{val|6.674|e=-11}}, and ''c'' = {{val|2.998|e=8}} (all in [[International System of Units|SI]] units), gives:
: &lt;math&gt; \Delta \left(\frac{1}{\gamma }\right) \approx 5.307\times 10^{-10} &lt;/math&gt;
This represents the fraction by which the satellites' clocks move faster than Earth's. It is then multiplied by the number of nanoseconds in a day:
: &lt;math&gt; 5.307\times 10^{-10}\times 60\times 60\times 24\times 10^9\approx 45850 \text{ ns} &lt;/math&gt;

That is, the satellites' clocks gain 45,850 nanoseconds a day due to [[general relativity]] effects. These effects are added together to give (rounded to 10 ns):

: 45850 – 7210 = 38640 ns

Hence the satellites' clocks gain approximately 38,640 nanoseconds a day or 38.6 μs per day due to relativity effects in total.

In order to compensate for this gain, a GPS clock's frequency needs to be slowed by the fraction:

: {{val|5.307|e=-10}} – &amp;nbsp;{{val|8.349|e=-11}} = {{val|4.472|e=-10}}

This fraction is subtracted from 1 and multiplied by the pre-adjusted clock frequency of 10.23&amp;nbsp;MHz:

: (1 – &amp;nbsp;{{val|4.472|e=-10}}) × 10.23 = 10.22999999543

That is, we need to slow the clocks down from 10.23&amp;nbsp;MHz to 10.22999999543&amp;nbsp;MHz in order to negate the effects of relativity.

=== Sagnac distortion ===
GPS observation processing must also compensate for the [[Sagnac effect]]. The GPS time scale is defined in an [[inertial]] system but observations are processed in an [[ECEF|Earth-centered, Earth-fixed]] (co-rotating) system, a system in which [[simultaneity]] is not uniquely defined. A coordinate transformation is thus applied to convert from the inertial system to the ECEF system. The resulting signal run time correction has opposite algebraic signs for satellites in the Eastern and Western celestial hemispheres. Ignoring this effect will produce an east–west error on the order of hundreds of nanoseconds, or tens of meters in position.&lt;ref&gt;Ashby, Neil [http://www.ipgp.fr/~tarantola/Files/Professional/GPS/Neil_Ashby_Relativity_GPS.pdf Relativity and GPS]. [[Physics Today]], May 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Natural sources of interference ==
Since GPS signals at terrestrial receivers tend to be relatively weak, natural radio signals or scattering of the GPS signals can [[Desensitization (telecommunications)|desensitize]] the receiver, making acquiring and tracking the satellite signals difficult or impossible.

== Artificial sources of interference ==
In automotive GPS receivers, metallic features in windshields,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.illinoistollway.com/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/TW_CONTENT_REPOSITORY/TW_CR_IPASS/LPT-SPECIALWINDSHIELDLIST.PDF |title=I-PASS Mounting for Vehicles with Special Windshield Features |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100326035712/http://www.illinoistollway.com/pls/portal/docs/PAGE/TW_CONTENT_REPOSITORY/TW_CR_IPASS/LPT-SPECIALWINDSHIELDLIST.PDF |archivedate=March 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; such as defrosters, or car window tinting films&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://solutions.3m.com/wps/portal/3M/en_US/WF/3MWindowFilms/Products/ProductCatalog/?PC_7_RJH9U5230GE3E02LECFTDQG0V7_nid=9928QS9MGHbeT4DCJBL6BVgl |title=3M Automotive Films}}. Note that the 'Color Stable' films are specifically described as ''not'' interfering with satellite signals.&lt;/ref&gt; can act as a [[Faraday cage]], degrading reception just inside the car.

Man-made [[electromagnetic interference|EMI]] (electromagnetic interference) can also disrupt or [[radio jamming|jam]] GPS signals. In one well-documented case it was impossible to receive GPS signals in the entire harbor of [[Moss Landing, California]] due to unintentional jamming caused by malfunctioning TV antenna preamplifiers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://gpsworld.com/the-hunt-rfi/ | title=The Hunt for RFI | work=GPS World | date=1 January 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.compliance-club.com/archive/bananaskins/201-225.asp |title=EMC compliance club "banana skins" column 222 |publisher=Compliance-club.com |date= |accessdate=2009-10-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Intentional jamming is also possible. Generally, stronger signals can interfere with GPS receivers when they are within radio range or line of sight. In 2002 a detailed description of how to build a short-range GPS L1 C/A jammer was published in the online magazine [[Phrack]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.phrack.org/issues.html?issue=60&amp;id=13#article Low Cost and Portable GPS Jammer]. [[Phrack]] issue 0x3c (60), article 13. Published December 28, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. government]] believes that such jammers were used occasionally during the [[War in Afghanistan (2001–present)|War in Afghanistan]], and the U.S. military claims to have destroyed six GPS jammers during the [[Iraq War]], including one that was destroyed with a GPS-guided bomb.&lt;ref&gt;American Forces Press Service. [http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=29230 Centcom charts progress]. March 25, 2003. {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091203004107/http://www.defenselink.mil/news/newsarticle.aspx?id=29230 |date=December 3, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A GPS jammer is relatively easy to detect and locate, making it an attractive target for [[anti-radiation missile]]s. The UK Ministry of Defence tested a jamming system in the UK's West Country on 7 and 8 June 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-460279/MoDs-tests-send-satnav-haywire-road-atlas.html | title = MoD's tests will send satnav haywire so take a road atlas | date = 2007-06-06 | work = The Daily Mail }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some countries allow the use of GPS repeaters to allow the reception of GPS signals indoors and in obscured locations; while in other countries these are prohibited as the retransmitted signals can cause multi-path interference to other GPS receivers that receive data from both GPS satellites and the repeater. In the UK Ofcom now permits the use of GPS/GNSS Repeaters&lt;ref name=Ofcom&gt;[http://stakeholders.ofcom.org.uk/consultations/gnss-repeaters/statement/] Ofcom Statement on Authorisation regime for GNSS repeaters&lt;/ref&gt; under a 'light licensing' regime.

Due to the potential for both natural and man-made noise, numerous techniques continue to be developed to deal with the interference. The first is to not rely on GPS as a sole source. According to John Ruley, "[[Instrument flight rules|IFR]] pilots should have a fallback plan in case of a GPS malfunction".&lt;ref&gt;Ruley, John. AVweb. [http://www.avweb.com/news/avionics/182754-1.html GPS jamming]. February 12, 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Receiver Autonomous Integrity Monitoring]] (RAIM) is a feature included in some receivers, designed to provide a warning to the user if jamming or another problem is detected. The U.S. military has also deployed since 2004 their [[SAASM|Selective Availability / Anti-Spoofing Module]] (SAASM) in the [[Defense Advanced GPS Receiver]] (DAGR).&lt;ref&gt;[https://rdit.army.mil/GPS/CustomContent/gps/ue/dagr.html US Army DAGR page] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20120805212524/https://rdit.army.mil/GPS/CustomContent/gps/ue/dagr.html |date=2012-08-05 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In demonstration videos the DAGR was shown to detect jamming and maintain its lock on the encrypted GPS signals during interference which caused civilian receivers to lose lock.

'''Gard''' or [[Gord (archaeology)]]. A Slavic term for "town", "city" or "castle." It's of Pomeranian origin and is in use in contemporary '''Kashubian''' language. It survived in such Pomeranian geographical names as:

* [[Stargard]] in West Pomerania
* [[Starogard Gdański]] in East Pomerania
* [[Nowogard]] in West Pomerania
* [[Białogard]] in West Pomerania

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4421">The '''geology of [[Croatia]]''' includes Precambrian rocks, covered over by younger sedimentary rocks and deformed or superimposed by tectonic activity. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|year=1997|title=Encyclopedia of European &amp; Asian Regional Geology|publisher=Springer|p=156-160}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geologic History &amp; Stratigraphy==
[[Precambrian]] rocks only outcrop in the north in between the Sava River and Drava River and include [[amphibolite]] [[schist]], micaschist, [[gneiss]] and [[granites]]. Early [[Paleozoic]] rocks include clastic rocks with calcareous intercalations near the Pannonian region and along the Inner Hinterland. Only [[Ordovician]], [[Silurian]] and [[Devonian]] rocks have been confirmed with fossil evidence. [[Conglomerate (geology)|Conglomerate]], [[shale]] and [[sandstone]] are typical of the late Paleozoic. Inliers and overthrusts from this period ([[Carboniferous]]-[[Permian]]) are up to 3.5 kilometers thick in the Main Dinaric Ridge.

A gap in sedimentation defines the boundary between the Permian and beginning of the [[Mesozoic]] in the [[Triassic]]. [[Allochthon]] [[dolomite]] and clastic rocks are common. Early Triassic rocks include siltite, mica, shale, thin limestone, gypsum and dolomite, while shelf limestone, dolomite and [[ammonite]] nests are typical of the Middle Triassic. Platy limestone, [[tuff]] and [[andesite]] from igneous activity are also common in this time frame. 

Up to 2.5 kilometers of reef limestone deposited in the Dinaric and Adriatic areas in the [[Jurassic]] and [[Malmian]] pelagic [[chert]] outcrops in the Main Dinaric Ridge. Oceanic rock appears in the [[Jurassic#Divisions|Dogger-Malm]] time with green sandstone, [[peridotite]], [[serpentinite]], [[spilite]], [[diabase]] and [[melaphyre]]. Platy limestone and chert deposited widely, up to four kilometers thick in the [[Cretaceous]]. 

[[Cenozoic]] [[Paleogene]] rocks unconformably overlie Cretaceous rocks with [[bauxite]], coal and freshwater limestone, overlain by marine limestone from the [[Eocene]] and [[flysch]] formed in a trough between two carbonate platforms. Sandstone, marl and limestone deposited in basins now beneath the Adriatic Sea during the [[Neogene]]. In the Pannonian area, Neogene material lies on top of older bedrock, emplaced on the periphery of the Paratethys Ocean. Neogene rocks include marl, conglomerate, sandstone, as well as andesite and tuff. In the Drava River valley, the Neogene is seven kilometers thick. Many units contain [[lignit]] and oil is found in lower units. Sand and clay from the last 2.5 million years of the [[Quaternary]] unconformably overlies Neogene rocks beneath the Adriatic. Karst rivers often contain glacial sediments and terra rossa is common both offshore and on the Main Dinaric Ridge. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=157-159}}

==Structural &amp; Tectonic Geology==
Croatia is part of the Dinarides. Early tectonic evolution in the Precambrian or Paleozoic is difficult to determine due to reworking in subsequent orogenies. The region's carbonate platform was split by an open sea belt in the Triassic, creating the Adriatic and Dinaric platforms. It resulted in local, intense continental subduction. Ultramafic [[ophiolite]] formed with the opening of a branch of the Tethys Ocean in the Cretaceous, followed by magmatic activity. With continued continental subduction in the Paleogene, uplift and the formation of tectonic windows began. The Adriaticum is a carbonate platform structural belt with Mesozoic-Paleogene flysch, chert and limestone superimposed on it. The Supradinaricum forms a [[nappe]] on the Dinaricum and are tectonically complex with oceanic rocks underlain by platform deposits. 

Evidence of the Carboniferous [[Variscan orogeny]] remains in Mt. Papuk in the east. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=159}}

==Natural resource geology==
Coal, oil, gas and water are the leading natural resources in Croatia. The carbonate platform karst landscape of Croatia helped to create the weathering conditions to form bauxite. Anhydrite, gypsum, clay, sand amphibolite, granite, spilite, gabbro, diabase and limestone are all quarried for building. {{sfn| Moores, E.M.; Fairbridge, Rhodes W.|1997|p=159}}

Guyana occurs within the northern part of the [[Guiana Shield]].The Guiana Shield forms the northern part of the [[Amazonian Craton]], the core of the South American continent.

Most of the geology of northern Guyana consists of [[Paleoproterozoic|Palaeoproterozoic]] [[Orosirian]] greenstone belts (Barama and Mazaruni Supergroups) intruded by granites. These are overlain unconformably by the [[Statherian]] Burro-Burro Group, which consist of the Muruwa Formation sandstones and Iwokrama Formation felsic volcanics. Both are intruded by granites associated with the Iwokrama Formation.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5848">The '''geology of the Netherlands''' describes the [[geologic timescale|geological sequence]] of the [[Netherlands]]. Large parts of the Netherlands today are below [[sea level]] and have in the past been covered by the sea or flooded at regular intervals. The modern Netherlands formed as a result of the interplay of the four main rivers ([[Rhine]], [[Meuse]], [[Schelde]] and [[IJssel]]) and the influence of the [[North Sea]]. The Netherlands is mostly composed of [[river delta|deltaic]], [[coast]]al and [[Aeolian processes|eolian]] derived sediments during the [[Pleistocene]] [[glacial]] and [[interglacial]] periods.

Fairly all of the west Netherlands is composed of the [[Rhine]]-[[Meuse]] river [[estuary]], but [[civilisation|human intervention]] greatly modified the natural processes at work. Most of the western Netherlands is below sea level due to the human process of turning standing bodies of water into usable land, a [[polder]].

In the east of the Netherlands, remains are found of the last [[ice age]], which ended approximately ten thousand years ago. As the continental [[ice sheet]] moved in from the north, it pushed [[moraine]] forward. The ice sheet halted as it covered the eastern half of the Netherlands. After the ice age ended, the [[moraine]] remained in the form a long hill-line. The cities of [[Arnhem]] and [[Nijmegen]] are built upon these hills.

==Sedimentary succession==
[[File:Map provinces Netherlands-en.svg|thumb|250px|Map of the Netherlands]]
===Paleozoic Era===
[[Rock (geology)|Rock]]s from the [[Carboniferous]] period (360 - 299 [[Mya (unit)|mya]]) [[outcrop]] in the southeastern province of [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], e.g. in the Heimans quarry. Younger sediments ([[Permian]] in age) are not exposed at surface. The [[Subsurface (geology)|subsurface]] of the Netherlands (including the Dutch sectors of the North Sea) is geologically far more significant especially with respect to the occurrence of [[oil]] and [[gas]] resources. The [[Slochteren]] reservoir rock in [[Groningen (province)|Groningen]] is an eolian [[sandstone]] from the [[Rotliegend]] (lower Permian). This reservoir has excellent [[porosity]] and [[Permeability (fluid)|permeability]] characteristics and supplies the vast majority of the Dutch natural gas reserves. The lateral equivalent of this reservoir comes at surface near the [[Germany|German]] town of [[Bad Bentheim]].

The latest Permian deposits in the area of northwestern [[Europe]] was characterised by the laying down of thick successions of [[rocksalt]] and [[anhydrite]]. This [[Zechstein]] stage also comprises [[dolomite]]s and [[limestone]]s. The salt is mined in the east of the Netherlands (in villages as [[Boekelo]]) and forms an excellent seal over the deeper North Sea reservoirs.

===Mesozoic Era===
[[Mesozoic Era|Mesozoic]] rocks are exposed in the Netherlands in the [[quarry]] near [[Winterswijk]] ([[Triassic]] ''[[Muschelkalk]]'' [[limestone]]s). The Jurassic [[Posidonia Shale]] is well developed but is buried deep in the West and under the North Sea. It acts as source rock for oil fields in the [[West Netherlands Basin]]. During late Jurassic times the [[Zuidwal volcano]] was active in a now submerged part of the Netherlands known as the [[Wadden Sea]].

During [[Cretaceous]] times, most of the Netherlands was covered by a warm shallow (inland) sea in which thick successions of [[chalk]] were deposited. This is in places [[chert]]-bearing; chalk is mined near the southern city of [[Maastricht]] and the [[Maastrichtian]] stage was named after this locality. Here a number of [[mosasaur]]-[[fossil]]s have been excavated as well. The [[Schoonebeek]] oil-bearing sandstones are Early [[Cretaceous]] in age and underlain by  [[hydrocarbon]]-rich Lower Cretaceous lacustrine Coevorden Formation which forms the [[source rock]] for the east Netherlands oil.

===Cenozoic Era===
The [[Cenozoic]] is characterised by a further shallowing and erosion of earlier sediments. In places a reasonable thickness of [[Paleocene]] and [[Eocene]] sediments is reached, but most of the subsurface of the Netherlands lack deposits of this age.

The recent Netherlands is formed by [[Pleistocene]] and [[Holocene]] age sediments as result of ([[ice|glacio]])-[[fluvial]], [[Aeolian processes|eolian]] and [[Marine (ocean)|marine]] sedimentation. Eolian dunes characterise the [[North Sea]] coast, a [[horseshoe]]-shaped [[moraine]] forms the [[Utrecht Hill Ridge]] (Dutch: Utrechtse Heuvelrug) and the river influence is still visible all over the Netherlands.

==Tectonics and orogeny==
Although the Netherlands seems to be a [[tectonics|tectonically]] quiet area, a number of fault activities have been shown in the past. The latest strong [[earthquake]], the [[1992 Roermond earthquake]] (5.4 on [[Richter scale]]), had its [[epicenter]] close to the Limburg city of [[Roermond]]. The south of the Netherlands is topographically higher and is linked to the geology of the [[Ardennes]] and the [[London-Brabant Massif]]. The Lower Rhine Graben, part of the [[European Cenozoic Rift System]], which has been tectonically active since the Oligocene, affects the southwestern part of the Netherlands.

'''Greater Indonesia''', or in [[Indonesian language|Indonesian]] and [[Malaysian language|Malaysian]], '''''Indonesia Raya''''' or '''''Melayu Raya''''', was a political concept that sought to bring the so-called [[Malay race]], only part of which were the actual [[Malays (ethnic group)|Malays]], together by uniting the British territories of [[British Malaya|Malaya]] and [[British Borneo|Borneo]] with the [[Dutch East Indies]].&lt;ref name="McIntyre"&gt;{{cite journal |last=McIntyre |first=Angus |authorlink= |coauthors= |year=1973 |month= |title=The 'Greater Indonesia' Idea of Nationalism in Malaysia and Indonesia. |journal=Modern Asian Studies |volume=7 |issue=1 |pages=75–83 |id= |url= |doi=10.1017/S0026749X0000439X}}&lt;!--|accessdate= 16 February 2008 --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; It was espoused by students and graduates of [[Universiti Pendidikan Sultan Idris|Sultan Idris Training College for Malay Teachers]] in the late 1920s, and individuals from Sumatra and Java including [[Muhammad Yamin]] and [[Sukarno]]  in the 1950s.&lt;ref name="McIntyre" /&gt; ''[[Indonesia Raya]]'' ("Greater Indonesia") is also the name of the Indonesian national anthem.

== Development of idea in colonial era ==
The Pan-Malay union was based on understandings on [[Malay race|similarities in race, shared language, religion and culture]] among ethnic groups in [[Maritime Southeast Asia]]. The ancient concept of ''[[Malay world|Alam Melayu]]'' or ''[[Nusantara]]'' advocates an historical awareness that the territory of [[British Malaya]], [[British Borneo]] and the [[Dutch East Indies]] were once united, to a degree, under native empires such as [[Srivijaya]], [[Majapahit]], the [[Malacca Sultanate]], [[Johor Sultanate|Johor]]-[[Riau Sultanate|Riau]] Sultanate and various other sultanates in [[Borneo]] island.

At the end of the 1920s, the idea to form a new independent nation grew among the people of Dutch East Indies, especially among educated [[pribumi]] (native Indonesian). While in the Malay peninsula, the idea of Greater Malay was proposed. In the Dutch East Indies, the activist youth of Indonesian nationalists were more interested in forming an independent Indonesia. In 1928 the [[Youth Pledge]] was declared in Batavia (today Jakarta) by Indonesian nationalist youth activists proclaiming three ideals; one motherland, one nation, and support one unifying language.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sumpahpemuda.org/ Sumpah Pemuda]&lt;/ref&gt;

The Malay nationalist [[Kesatuan Melayu Muda]] group, founded in 1938 by [[Ibrahim Hj Yaacob]], was one of the more notable entities that embraced the concept as part of its goals.&lt;ref&gt;Page 208-209 ''Kurikulum Bersepadu Sekolah Menengah Sejarah Tingkatan 2.''

== World War II ==
During [[World War II]] advocates of Greater Indonesia collaborated with the [[Japanese Empire|Japanese]] against the British and the Dutch.&lt;ref name="Graham"&gt;{{cite paper|first=Brown|last=Graham|url=http://www.crise.ox.ac.uk/pubs/workingpaper10.pdf|title=The Formation and Management of Political Identities: Indonesia and Malaysia Compared|publisher=Centre for Research on Inequality, Human Security and Ethnicity, CRISE, University of Oxford|date=February 2005|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120210163849/http://www.crise.ox.ac.uk/pubs/workingpaper10.pdf|archivedate=10 February 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The co-operation was based on the understanding that Japan would unite the Dutch East Indies, Malaya and Borneo and grant them independence.&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt; It was understood that under a unified Japanese occupation of these areas, the formation of Greater Indonesia was possible.&lt;ref name="Graham" /&gt;

In January 1942, [[Kesatuan Melayu Muda]] (KMM) requested the Japanese to grant Malaya the independence the Japanese had promised earlier. This was the first request for Malayan independence by a Malaya-wide political body. The request however was turned down.&lt;ref&gt;Insun Sony Mustapha. [http://www.malaysia-today.net/books/2005/07/introduction.htm Review of Malay nationalism before UMNO] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071229104648/http://www.malaysia-today.net/books/2005/07/introduction.htm |date=29 December 2007 }}. [[Malaysia Today]]. Retrieved 1 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The Japanese authorities instead disbanded Kesatuan Melayu Muda and established the ''Pembela Tanah Ayer'' (also known as the ''Malai Giyu Gun'' or by its [[Malay language|Malay]] acronym PETA) militia in its stead.

In July 1945 the KRIS (''Kesatuan Rakyat Indonesia Semenanjung'') or Indonesian Peninsular People Union, that later the name would be changed to ''"Kekuatan Rakyat Indonesia Istimewa"'' (Special Indonesian People Force) was formed in British Malaya under the leadership of Ibrahim Yaacob and Dr. Burhanuddin Al-Hemy with the aim to achieve independence from Great Britain and union with Republic of Indonesia. This plan has been consulted with Sukarno and Hatta.&lt;ref name="Reinventing Indonesia"&gt;{{cite book|title=Reinventing Indonesia: menemukan kembali masa depan bangsa|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Hqf1kaxuL3MC&amp;pg=PA72|year=2008|language=Indonesian|publisher=PT Mizan Publika|isbn=978-979-433-516-1|pages=72–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 August 1945, Ibrahim Yaacob met with Sukarno, Hatta and Dr. Radjiman in [[Taiping (Malaysia)|Taiping]], [[Perak]]. Sukarno transited in Taiping airport on his flight back from Saigon back to Jakarta. Previously Sukarno was summoned by Field Marshal [[Hisaichi Terauchi]] in Dalat to discuss about the Indonesian independence and to receive direct statement from Terauchi that Japanese Empire permitted the independence of Indonesia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Rushdy Hoesein|title=Terobosan Sukarno dalam Perundingan Linggarjati|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XK4SaVKUwO8C&amp;pg=PA39|year=2010|language=Indonesian|publisher=Penerbit Buku Kompas|isbn=978-979-709-489-8|pages=39–}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this meeting Yaacob expressed his intention to unite Malay Peninsula into independent Indonesia. It was in this short conference that Sukarno, flanked by Hatta, shook hands with Ibrahim Yaacob and said, 'Let us form one single Motherland for all the sons of Indonesia'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Joseph Chinyong Liow|title=The Politics of Indonesia-Malaysia Relations: One Kin, Two Nations|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PFq_7fuwtNwC&amp;pg=PA59|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-0-415-34132-5|pages=59–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, on 15 August 1945 [[Emperor Hirohito]] declared the surrender of Japanese Empire through radio broadcast. Promptly, Sukarno and Hatta [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence|proclaimed Indonesian Republic independence]] on 17 August 1945. Accused as collaborator, on 19 August Ibrahim Yaacob flew in Japanese military aeroplane to Jakarta. Yaacob sought refuge in Jakarta with his wife Mariatun Haji Siraj, his in-law Onan Haji Siraj and Hassan Manan. Ibrahim Yaacob that fought for the unity of Malay Peninsula into Indonesia then resides in Jakarta until his death in 1979.

With the [[surrender of Japan]] in August 1945, former Kesatuan Melayu Muda cadres formed the nucleus of the emerging political movements like the Malay Nationalist Party, Angkatan Pemuda Insaf, and [[Angkatan Wanita Sedar]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=From PKI to the Comintern, 1924-1941: The Apprenticeship of the Malayan Communist Party |last=Ooi |first=Keat Gin |authorlink= |year=2004 |publisher=ABC-CLIO |location=Oxford |isbn=1-57607-770-5 |pages=1791}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Malaya: The Making of a Neo-colony |last=Mohamed Amin |first= |authorlink= |author2=Malcolm Caldwell |author3=Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation |year=1977 |publisher=Bertrand Russell Peace Foundation |location=Nottingham |isbn=0-85124-190-5 |pages=265}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Politics in a plural society: a study of non-communal political parties in West Malaysia |last1=Vasil |first1=R.

On the other hand, after the [[Proclamation of Indonesian Independence]], through armed battles in [[Indonesian National Revolution]] between 1945–1949, the Republic of Indonesia finally gained recognition of sovereignty from the [[Netherlands]] during [[Dutch–Indonesian Round Table Conference]] in 1949. While across the straits after Japanese occupation the Malay Peninsula returned to British control.

== Confrontation and the Greater Indonesia ideal ==

After the end of World War II, the idea of Greater Indonesia was little heard until more than ten years later. In the late 1950s, Sukarno strongly opposed the British decolonisation initiative involving the formation of the Federation of Malaysia that would comprise the Malay Peninsula and North Borneo. That hostile political stance led to the [[Indonesia–Malaysia Confrontation]] in the early 1960s that was manifested in an undeclared war with small scale transborder battles and military infiltration in Borneo. Sukarno accused the new nation of Malaysia of being a British puppet state aimed at establishing neo-imperialism and neo-colonialism in Southeast Asia, and also at containing Indonesian ambition to be the regional hegemonic power. However, it was also suggested that Sukarno's campaign against the formation of Malaysia was actually motivated by a desire to unite the Malay Peninsula to complete the previously abandoned idea of Greater Indonesia.

In late 1965, the failed [[30 September Movement]] coup attempt caused Sukarno to fall from power and General [[Suharto]] to seize power in Indonesia. Because of this internal conflict, Indonesia lost its desire to continue its hostile policy against Malaysia, and therefore the war ended. On 28 May 1966, a conference held in Bangkok secured an agreement between the Federation of Malaysia and Republic of Indonesia to resolve the conflict. The violence ended in June, and the peace deal was signed on 11 August and officially recognised two days later. With this treaty, Indonesia and Malaysia officially agreed to be two separate national entities that mutually recognised each other's existence and sovereignty.

== Contemporary events ==
After the Indonesia-Malaysia peace deal, Indonesia was occupied with its own domestic problems building its economy while tried to maintain its unity as a diverse and plural nation. As a result, during the reign of Suharto freedom and democracy were sacrificed in the name of national stability and unity. In 1975 Indonesia annexed the former Portuguese colony of [[East Timor]] that finally achieved independence from Indonesia in 1999. Indonesia suffered various problems ranging from economic crisis, separatist movements in [[Aceh]] and [[West Papua (region)|Papua]], to the problem of [[terrorism]]. Indonesia is more interested in defining itself as Indonesian by trying to develop national character building, to define themselves as pluralist nation encapsulated in [[Bhinneka Tunggal Ika]] (unity in diversity) under [[Pancasila (politics)|Pancasila]] as national ideology with territorial claim only spanned from Sabang in Aceh to Merauke in Papua.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.setneg.go.id/index.php?Itemid=222&amp;id=2800&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view|title=Membangun Masa Depan Indonesia|author=Akbar Tandjung (Mantan Ketua Dewan Perwakilan Rakyat Republik Indonesia Periode 1999-2004)|language=Indonesian|publisher=Ministry of State Secretariat of the Republic of Indonesia|accessdate=16 October 2015|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120421175018/http://www.setneg.go.id/index.php?Itemid=222&amp;id=2800&amp;option=com_content&amp;task=view|archivedate=21 April 2012|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the largest nation in Southeast Asia, Indonesia seems to be satisfied on channelling its regional ambition through assuming leadership role among [[ASEAN]] countries.

On the other side, Malaysia was struggling on national building and facing problems regarding the national format alternatives; between leftist republic fighter and rightist traditional royalist. The remnants of Kesatuan Melayu Muda — the advocate of unification with Indonesia, which had been fighting for the independence for Malaya, aspired for the formation of Greater Indonesia or Greater Malay, to join the republic and encourage to overthrow the monarchy. However, at that time the majority of Malays supported the traditional institution of the Malay rulers ([[Monarchies of Malaysia|Malay Kingship]]) and Islam as national ideology; which led to the prominence of [[United Malays National Organisation]] (UMNO), which fought to uphold the traditional institution of the Malay Rulers and the special status of Islam.

The national unity issues in Malaysia also has been aggravated with inter-racial tensions, especially between the Malay majority with Chinese and Hindu Indian minorities, the problem that plagued Malaysian politics up until now.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://content.time.com/time/world/article/0,8599,1687973,00.html|title=Facing Malaysia's Racial Issues|author=Baradan Kuppusamy|publisher=[[Time (magazine)|Time]]|date=26 November 2007|accessdate=16 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The racial issue and the disagreement on citizenship and privileged issues between [[Bumiputra]] and Chinese and Indian Malaysian is the very problems that has caused the separation of [[Singapore]] from Malaysia back in the 1960s. By the end of the 1960s, UMNO gained domination in Malaysian politics, while their rival, the advocate of the republic and the union with Greater Indonesia, are stigmatised as leftists, communists or even traitors. In North Borneo, the [[Brunei]] royals chose not to follow [[Sarawak]] and [[Sabah]] on forming the Malaysia and remained under British protection until 1984.

With both parties kept busy and being occupied in their own problems, taking their own path of national systems; the ideal of a grand union that united the whole so-called Malay race under one great national entity called Greater Malay or Greater Indonesia has finally faded away, ceased to exist and remain [[irredentist]].

'''John Francon Williams''' [[FRGS]] (1854 – 4 September 1911) was a Welsh writer, geographer, historian, journalist, [[cartographer]] and inventor, born in [[Llanllechid]], [[Caernarvonshire]]. His seminal work was ''The Geography of the Oceans''.

==Family==
John Francon Williams was the second son of Richard Williams (b. 1818 [[Llanllechid]]) and his wife Mary (b. 1822 [[Denbighshire]]). Richard and Mary were blessed with two further sons William (b. 1843) and Henry (b. 1858), and two daughters, Mary Jr. (b. 1857)&lt;ref&gt;1861 UK Census Richard Williams (aged 43), Mary Williams (aged 39) and their children, William (aged 18), John (aged 7), Mary (aged 4), Henry (aged 3), residing at Cenfaes Terrace, Llanllechid, (retrieved 12 February 2018, findmypast.co.uk)&lt;/ref&gt; and Grace (b. 1862).&lt;ref&gt;1871 UK Census Richard Williams (aged 54), Mary Williams (aged 49) and their children, John (aged 17), Mary (aged 14), Henry (aged 13), and Grace (aged 9) residing at Pencennant (''Pen-y-ceunant''), Llanllechid, (retrieved 12 February 2018, findmypast.co.uk)&lt;/ref&gt; All the siblings were born in [[Llanllechid]], North Wales. The Williams family first lived at Cenfaes Terrace and then, as the family grew larger, moved to a stone cottage at 5 Pencennant (''Pen-y-ceunant''), one of a row of traditional terraced stone cottages in [[Llanllechid]], where all their immediate neighbours were also named Williams. The cottages positioned on a gentle slope had views directly overlooking the [[Ogwen Valley]] and the Snowdonian Mountains in the distance. Richard worked nearby as a slate quarryman (most probably) in [[Penrhyn Quarry]] located north of [[Bethesda, Gwynedd|Bethesda]] overlooking the [[River Ogwen]]. The Quarry was owned and run by the wealthy Dawkins-Pennant family, who also owned [[Penrhyn Castle]] and most of the land in the area. Over time, Richard Williams was promoted to the role of 'Overlooker' (a term used in the 19th century for a superintendent or overseer)&lt;ref&gt;Obscure Old English Occupations:http://www.worldthroughthelens.com/family-history/old-occupations.php (retrieved 12 February 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; at the slate quarry where he worked. 

During the next decade an increase of population in the area arose due to the extension of slate and stone quarrying. In the [[Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales]] (published in 1870-2), [[Llanllechid]] is described as thus: "Llanllechid, a village, a parish, and a sub-district in Bangor district, Carnarvon. The village stands near the river Ogwen, 3½ miles SW by S of Aber r. station, and 3½ SE of Bangor; and has a post office under Bangor, and a fair on 29 October."&lt;ref&gt;[[Imperial Gazetteer of England and Wales]] edited by Rev. John Marius Wilson (1870–72) published Edinburgh, A. Fullarton &amp; Co.: [http://www.visionofbritain.org.uk/place/6570].&lt;/ref&gt;

John and his two brothers and two sisters all attended the local school, where John showed a particularly strong aptitude and interest in Geography and History. By the mid-1870s, as a young adult, John moved away from Wales to [[Northampton]] where he took up a post as a school teacher. It was in [[Northampton]] that John met his future wife, Barbara.

==Career==
===Early career===
John Francon Williams worked as a journalist and editor on various newspapers and journals in [[Liverpool]]. In 1876 Williams was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Geographical Society]].&lt;ref&gt;Journal of the Royal Geographical Society, vol. 50, publ. 1880: List of the Fellows of the Royal Geographical Society; The number of Fellows elected during the past year (ending April 30th, 1880) included, John Francon Williams Esq. c/o George Philip &amp; Son, Caxton Buildings, Liverpool; https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.70717/2015.70717.Journal-Of-The-Royal-Geographical-Society-Vol50_djvu.txt&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Elected 13 March 1876 according to Archivist, Foyle Reading Room RGS-IBG&lt;/ref&gt;

===Association with George Philip &amp; Son===
[[File:Geography of America by John Francon Williams01.jpg|thumb|Geography of America by John Francon Williams]]
Williams started his publishing career in [[Liverpool]] under the guidance of the renowned cartographer and map publisher [[George Philip (cartographer)|George Philip]]. [[George Philip &amp; Son]] published maps and educational books, and in 1881 they published Williams's first book, ''A Class-Book of Modern Geography'', with examination questions, notes &amp; index. The book was written in collaboration with cartographer Professor [[William Hughes (geographer)]] [[FRGS]], and became the first publication in a successful run of works over the coming two decades by Williams for the publishing house George Philip &amp; Son. Between 1881 and 1893, George Philip &amp; Son published twelve English editions of ''A Class-Book of Modern Geography''.
[[George Philip (cartographer)|George Philip]] (1800–1882) and his son George Jr (1823–1902), ran [[George Philip &amp; Son]], and when [[George Philip (cartographer)|George Philip]] Sr retired on 1 July 1879 George Philip Jr took control of the business. The publishing house produced geographical and educational publications and operated from Caxton Buildings in [[Liverpool]], and from 30–32 [[Fleet Street]] in London.

"Further expansion was prompted by the demand from board schools established after 1870 for general textbooks, school stationery and equipment, and specialist atlases and wall maps. The firm also supplied atlases and textbooks for many overseas countries in several languages."&lt;ref&gt;[[George Philip (cartographer)|George Philip]] (biography), [[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]], [[Oxford University Press]] (retrieved 28 July 2017) http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/41112&lt;/ref&gt;
George Philip Jr spotted a gap in the market for quality school textbooks, and over the following two decades Williams wrote and edited over forty books that sold worldwide.

In 1881, Williams's seminal book ''The Geography of the Oceans'' was published.&lt;ref&gt;An extract from Geography of the Oceans by J. Francon Williams, 1881: The Atlantic Ocean Navigation and Commerce: (retrieved 18 September 2017):http://gluedideas.com/Geography-of-the-Oceans-1881/The-Atlantic-Ocean-Navigation.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Quoted in ''The Scotsman'', 17 October 2017, p. 34 – Sea the Danger (retrieved 4 November 2017)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

''The Geography of the Oceans'' focuses on topics such as: General Geography of the Oceans, Physical Geography of the Oceans, the Geography of Particular Oceans. The various sections focus on: the distribution of land and water, oceanic river-systems, the salts of the sea, the density, color and phosphorescence of the sea, distribution of marine life, temperature of the ocean, movements of the ocean, sidereal movements or tides, of the Atlantic, Pacific, Indian, Antarctic and the Arctic Ocean. It was the first book to cover with such intensity the geography of the oceans. 'A valuable little book entitled ''The Geography of the Oceans'', which may be regarded almost as a new departure in geographical science,' claimed the book reviewer in ''The Cornish Telegraph'', who continued,&lt;ref&gt;''The Cornish Telegraph'', Thursday 4 May 1882, p. 4 – Jottings From London (Column) ''The Geography of the Oceans'', (book review).&lt;/ref&gt; "I have found the book as fascinating as one of [[Jules Verne]]'s novels." The ''Daily Gazette'' called it, "A new geographical work of great importance".&lt;ref&gt;The ''Daily Gazette'' for Middlesbrough, Friday 4 March 1881, p. 2 – Literary Notes – ''The Geography of the Oceans'' (review).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1881, Williams and his family moved to [[West Derby]] in [[Lancashire]], where they lived at 52 Bonsall Road.&lt;ref&gt;1881 UK Census, West Derby, Lancashire, England. John and Barbara Williams. The Census states Barbara was born in Perthshire, Scotland.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[George Philip &amp; Son]] employed three in-house cartographers: [[John Bartholomew the elder]], [[William Hughes (geographer)]] and [[August Petermann]]. They were regarded as Europe's finest cartographers. As well as being a good friend of [[John Bartholomew]] J., Williams was also a friend of the Scottish journalist and writer [[John Geddie (journalist)|John Geddie]]. In June 1882 Williams, with cartographer [[John Bartholomew]] junior, nominated Geddie as a Fellow of the [[Royal Geographical Society]]. Williams was also acquainted with Edwin Ransom, owner of Kempston Mill, Bedford, [[Mayor of Bedford]] 1855–56, and proprietor of the ''Bedfordshire Times'' 1872–79. Ransom nominated Williams as a Fellow of the [[Royal Geographical Society]] in March 1876.&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence 9 May 2012, Archivist, Foyle Reading Room RGS-IBG.&lt;/ref&gt;

Williams also tried his hand as an inventor. One of his inventions (of which there were two different designs) was a new spaced measuring rule or scale, registered and patented on 21 April 1884.&lt;ref&gt;BT51/4/5500 – Class 3: wood, bone, ivory etc. Registered design No 5500: registered by John Francon Williams, Editor, of 57 Bonsall Road, West Derby, near Liverpool, Lancashire, 21 April 1884.

In 1887, Philips published ''Philip's Handy Volume Atlas of the World'' by [[William Hughes (geographer)]] and John Francon Williams. The pocket book contained 110 maps and plans all finely tinted, accompanied by statistical notes and other information. The ''Leeds Mercury'' said; "It would hardly be possible to find greater excellence in so convenient a form as we have in ''Philip's Handy Volume Atlas of the World.''"&lt;ref&gt;''Leeds Mercury'', Wednesday 13 July 1887, p. 9 – Literature – Philip's Handy Volume Atlas of the World  (book review)&lt;/ref&gt; ‘The volume deserves to have a wide circulation,’ stated the ''Liverpool Mercury'', and declared, "In fact, it is quite a little geographical library in itself."&lt;ref&gt;''Liverpool Mercury'', Wednesday 15 June 1887, p. 7. ''Philip's Handy Volume Atlas of the World'' by J. Francon Williams (review)&lt;/ref&gt; Williams dedicated the book to the President of the [[Royal Geographical Society]], [[Lord Aberdare]], Henry Austin Bruce, 1st Baron Aberdare. A glowing review of ''Philips' Handy Volume and Atlas of the World'' appeared in the ''West London Observer'' on Saturday 23 July 1887: "In days when the facilities of locomotion are such that everybody runs about the world, and the process of what popularly known as 'globe-trotting' goes on to an extraordinary extent and in a systematic manner, a comprehensive volume, small, compact, admirably arranged, clearly printed and well bound, and which can be carried in the pocket, like that published by Messrs. Philip &amp; Son of Liverpool and London, is entitled to be regarded as a special boon. Containing more than a hundred maps with brief but succinct notes and a capital index, the different countries of the world are revealed in all essential particulars with luminous perspicacity. The maps are fine specimens of engraving, and the letterpress clear and distinct. The author is Mr. J. Francon Williams FRGS and his name will be a sufficient guarantee for the correctness of the data furnished up to the period of publication. The production of this most useful work must have entailed a large outlay, but it cannot be doubted that, as it will supply a popular want, the sale will be enormous, and fully compensate the enterprising publishers for the cost and trouble incurred. We earnestly recommend the 'Handy Volume', not alone to travellers, but to all who have occasion in connection with literary pursuits, or the prosecution of business, 'to survey mankind from China to Peru,' or over those wider districts, which a century ago were practically beyond even a poets pen."&lt;ref&gt;''West London Observer'', Saturday 23 July 1887, p. 5 – Philips' Handy Volume and Atlas of the World'' (review).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the late 1880s, Williams worked in conjunction with the publisher and editor [[George Newnes]] (Sir George Newnes, 1st Baronet) – now regarded as the founding father of popular journalism – during the years when Newnes was building his publishing empire. It was during this period that Williams also founded his own publication.&lt;ref&gt;National Library Scotland – Map Division, 159 Causewayside, Edinburgh, EH9 1PH: J. F.

In 1888, Philips' published several geographical atlases they named 'Handy-Volumes' compiled and written by Williams that were distributed widely worldwide; ‘All these compact and clearly-printed miniature works, suitable for pocket or desk, and rightly named ‘Handy-Volumes’ are supplied with indexes, and geographical, statistical and historical notes, carefully gathered by Mr. J.

In [[America]], John’s history books were introduced into the school curriculum where they remained for many years.&lt;ref&gt;''Early American Textbooks 1775-1900'' by the Office of Educational Research and Improvement US Department of Education - John Francon Williams, pages 174 &amp; 175 lists the John Francon Williams books that became part of the American School Curriculum: http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.872.2900&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Forever the businessman, on 4 July 1888, Williams wrote a letter from [[Liverpool]] to the politician and educator Hon. [[George William Ross]] in [[Toronto]], [[Ontario]], [[Canada]], in which Williams included as a gift a copy of his recently published ''Atlas of British America''. Williams was hoping to break into the Canadian market. Ross was at that time the Minister of Education for [[Ontario]] in the Liberal government of Sir [[Oliver Mowat]] and oversaw the purchase of schoolbooks for the province. In the letter, Williams writes, ‘Permit me to beg your kind acceptance of the accompanying copy of our little ''Atlas of British America'', and also to ask you to examine it with a view to its authorization for use in the public schools and colleges of your province.’ In 1899, Ross became the [[Premier of Ontario]].&lt;ref&gt;Report of the Commissioners, publ.

In November 1889, John Francon Williams was introduced to HRH [[Edward VII|Albert Edward, Prince of Wales]]. During their meeting Williams presented the Prince of Wales with a copy of his 1887 book, ''Philips' Handy-volume Atlas of the British Empire''.

On 15 December 1890, the Council of the London branch of the [[Froebel Society]] – (established in 1874 to teach and validate school examinations and teaching training courses at kindergarten level, applying German educator [[Friedrich Frobel]]’s methods) – passed a resolution to publish a new monthly journal titled ''Child Life,'' dedicated to kindergarten education.&lt;ref&gt;[[Froebel Society]], 12 Buckingham Street, Adelphi, WC London: ‘By a resolution of the Council of December 15, 1890, ''Child Life'', a kindergarten journal, was adopted as the medium of communication among the subscribers of the [[Froebel Society]], but the journal is in no other sense the organ of the Society, nor is the Society in any way responsible for the opinions expressed therein. p. 15, Vol. 1 no 1’: http://urweb.roehampton.ac.uk/digital-collection/froebel-archive/child-life-journals/child-life-1891/index.html&lt;/ref&gt; The first publication priced at three pence was issued in January 1891.

In his articles Williams emphasizes the importance of maps in the study of geography and accents the necessity for children to learn the art of map reading. ‘Geography for all practical purposes of life is embodied in maps,’ and follows on by declaring, ‘Maps are to geography what notation is to music.’ He advises the prospective teacher that; ‘Every lesson must be thoughtfully and thoroughly prepared, and the more elementary the lesson the greater, and really, the need of careful preparation. Not everyone is a born teacher, but everyone engaged in teaching may, by diligent study and perseverance, gain by art what he has not by nature, and no subject affords such opportunities for the exercise and display of skill in the art of teaching as geography.’&lt;ref&gt;''Child Life'', February 1891 Vol. 1 no 2: J.

During 1891, Philip’s issued a series of Map-Drawing Books titled appropriately, ''Philips’ Series of Map-Drawing Books'' written and compiled by J. Francon Williams. A series of 24 books in two different editions were published; the Imperial at 13 in. by 11 in. priced at 6d, or the slightly smaller Crown edition at 10 in. by 8 in. priced at 3d. Each book contained a complete full-coloured map and an uncoloured map for the student to colour in and to complete names etc., an outline map with coastlines and lines of latitude and longitude, and a blank sheet with the border of only the map. The books allowed the student to draw the maps repeatedly.&lt;ref&gt;''The Seaman’s Medical Guide'', by Archibald Finlay, 1891, page 217, publ.

George Philip &amp; Son  – ''Philips’ Grammar School Atlases No. 1, No. 2 &amp; No. 3,'' edited by J. Francon Williams, 1891: https://archive.org/details/b20405650?q=Francon+williams &lt;/ref&gt; The atlases were referred to as being, ‘undoubtedly the finest examples of small atlases for ordinary school use ever issued.’

Also in 1891, Philip's published, ''Philips’ Picturesque History of England'' (with notes and three hundred illustrations and maps) by J. Francon Williams. The book retailed at 5s. A review in the ''[[Scotsman]]'' praised Williams for his ‘unflagging vivacity and narrative power. Incidents and characters are depicted in their true proportions.’&lt;ref&gt;''The Seaman’s Medical Guide'', by Archibald Finlay, 1891, page 225, publ. George Philip &amp; Son - ''Philips’ Picturesque History of England'' by J. Francon Williams, 1891: https://archive.org/details/b20405650?q=Francon+williams&lt;/ref&gt; ‘The book is appropriately named in more ways than one. It tells the story of the English people - their growth, the development of their national institutions, the establishment of their worldwide empire, the achievements of their great monarchs, warriors, statesmen and writers, the social and economic conditions of the nation at various epochs. A distinctive feature of the work is the number and excellence of the illustrations.’

In 1893, [[George Philip &amp; Son]] published the 866-page tome, ''A Compendium of Modern Geography - Physical - Political - Commercial'', by William Hughes and John Francon Williams. Williams writes in the preface of the book, ‘This work, as the tile implies, is designed for the use of advanced students, and also as a work of reference for those who are engaged in teaching geography.’ Compiling the book was a mammoth undertaking.  ‘All the Countries of the World, as well as the Continents, are described in a sufficiently exhaustive manner to meet the requirements of almost all examinations in geography. Due prominence has been given to the Mountain and River Systems and other natural features; the present political condition of each State is indicated and, bearing in mind the fact the study of Commercial geography is daily becoming of greater importance, the Industry and Trade of the principal countries are dealt with in considerable detail.’ Williams goes on to assure the reader, 'In the preparation of this work the best and most recent British and foreign authorities have been consulted, and no pains have been spared to make the book a reliable exponent of the geographical knowledge of the present day.'&lt;ref&gt;Preface in ''A Compendium of Modern Geography'' by William Hughes and J. Francon Williams, 1893, held in the archives at Central Library, William Brown Street, Liverpool L3 8EW: https://capitadiscovery.co.uk/liverpool/items/1028822?query=j.+francon+williams&amp;resultsUri=items%3Fquery%3Dj.%2Bfrancon%2Bwilliams&lt;/ref&gt; It was Williams that compiled, edited and wrote the majority of the book as [[William Hughes (geographer)]] had passed away seventeen years earlier in 1876.

In the decade prior to the arrival of ''[[Pears' Cyclopaedia]]'' (1897), a much smaller work measuring 135 x 105 mm was available. It sold for sixpence in cloth, or one shilling in leather hardback, and was extremely popular, selling 800,000 copies by 1896. Eli Lemon Sheldon (pen-name Dom Lemon) compiled the book. Its success led its publisher to create a series of similar little books that sold equally well. Number 36 in the series was ''A World Gazetteer'' compiled by John Francon Williams.&lt;ref&gt;George Philip 1888 Maps and John Francon Williams: Historyhttp://www.miniaturemaps.net/_webedit/uploaded-files/All%20Files/1851-1900/1888a%20Philip.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Williams' revised version had the same atlas, with slightly larger maps. [[George Philip &amp; Son]] printed the book.

===Later career===
In 1896, with Williams' increase in wealth he moved his family yet again,&lt;ref&gt;1891 UK Census, Wallasey, St Hilary, in Cheshire, England. The Williams family is living in Wallasey in Cheshire. John Francon Williams (aged 37)&lt;/ref&gt; this time to a freehold property in Mount Pleasant Road in [[Wallasey]], which he named Balmain, after his wife, whose middle name was Balmain.&lt;ref&gt;New Brighton Electoral Division, Wallasey Polling District, 1896 – John Francon Williams, Balmain, Mount Pleasant Road.&lt;/ref&gt;

By late 1898, the Williams family had moved yet again and were now living in a detached house, ''Fairlight'', in Forest Avenue, Chingford, London.&lt;ref&gt;Letter to [[John George Bartholomew]] from John Francon Williams, dated 17 November 1898, and addressed, Fairlight, Forest Avenue, Chingford, London – National Library Scotland – Map Division, 159 Causewayside, Edinburgh, EH91PH: J. F. Williams folder containing original hand-written letters by John Francon Williams dating from 1888–1900 &amp; 1906–1907, in the [[John George Bartholomew]] archive.&lt;/ref&gt;

In later life John Francon Williams focused his career on being a Publishers Representative (Agent). He would travel to [[Edinburgh]], [[Birmingham]], [[Liverpool]], [[Leicester]], [[Manchester]], London and also abroad, primarily the United States and Canada, pursuing and securing contracts for publishing houses. One of the houses he acted for in Edinburgh was [[John Bartholomew and Son]], which now belonged to his longtime friend, [[John George Bartholomew]]. Williams' eldest son, John Jr, would accompany his father on some of these trips. John Jr, was noted as being a sickly child, "who is much troubled with asthma and bronchitis."&lt;ref&gt;Letter written by John Francon Williams, dated 23 January 1899, to his friend [[John Bartholomew]], in which Williams talks of eldest son John, "who is much troubled with asthma and bronchitis."&lt;/ref&gt; In 1899, Williams’s friend Sir [[Alfred Lewis Jones]] of Messrs [[Elder Dempster Lines|Elder, Dempster &amp; Co.]], (a Liverpool, ship-owner) kindly gave Williams’s son John Jr a voyage on one of his steamers to [[New Orleans]], in the hope that it would help with his medical condition.

One of the prime reasons why Williams travelled to the United States was to try and set up an Anglo-American Syndicate, which would help promote publishers, publishing houses and their products. Williams discusses this matter in a handwritten letter to his friend [[John George Bartholomew]].&lt;ref&gt;Letter written by John Francon Williams, dated 28 January 1899, to his friend [[John George Bartholomew]], in which Williams talks of setting up an Anglo-American Syndicate.&lt;/ref&gt; Here he mentions his "unavoidable connection" with map-maker [[George Washington Bacon]], with whom he is working with on several projects, both editorial and administrative, and hopes that his friend Sir [[Alfred Lewis Jones]] (the millionaire ship-owner) might be interested in becoming a financial partner in the Syndicate. Williams was particularly keen to publish a Physical Atlas worldwide through the syndicate.

In 1899, Williams was commissioned by Mazawattee (publishers) to write a Gazetteer Pocket Atlas containing 9,000 to 10,000 places.&lt;ref&gt;In a handwritten letter from Williams to [[John George Bartholomew]] dated 3 January 1899 held in the [[National Library of Scotland]] Williams mentions his commission for the atlas by the Mazawattee company&lt;/ref&gt; Williams was also commissioned by [[Alfred Harmsworth]], (later 1st Viscount Northcliffe), founder of the ''Harmsworth Magazine'' (later known as the ''London Magazine''), to write a series of articles. His first article, published at the start of 1900, was entitled ''Then and Now: 1800–1900, Why This is the Most Wonderful Century in Time''. It was written to commemorate the advancement in engineering during the 19th century and to welcome in the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Then and Now: 1800–1900, Why This is the Most Wonderful Century in Time, article by J.F. Williams, article extracted from The ''Harmsworth Magazine''. Volume 3 – The National Archives, reference: D/B/BRY/1/2/670, Date: 1900, Held at: Hackney Archives Department. http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/12edb89a-d894-44f3-8719-16a03815534f.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 1900, John Francon Williams travelled to [[Boston]], Massachusetts, from [[Liverpool]] aboard the SS ''Winifredian''.&lt;ref&gt;Saloon Passenger List, SS Winifredian, Liverpool to Boston, ships Captain G.W. Muir, departing 20 July 1900 – John Francon Williams.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901, by the time George Philip Jr had retired from [[George Philip &amp; Son]], Williams had moved his family yet again, to 22 Queens Grove Road, [[Chingford]] in [[Essex]].&lt;ref&gt;1901 UK Census, Chingford, Essex, England: the Williams family are living in Chingford, Essex.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1901/02, the Williams family relocated yet again, this time to [[Clackmannan]] in Scotland, possibly for Barbara to be closer to her sisters, Ann and Margaret Dougall, along with whom they resided in Clackmannan at Mains House. Both were spinsters and died within a few days of one another, Ann Dougall on 17 March 1903 &lt;ref&gt;Register of Deaths: 1903, Deaths in the Parish of Clackmannan in the County of Clackmannanshire – p. 3, no. 8, Ann Balmain Dougall, aged 64, 17 March 1903 from breast cancer (retrieved 6 September 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; and Margaret Dougall three days later on 20 March 1903 (one day after her sister's burial).&lt;ref&gt;Register of Deaths: 1903, Deaths in the Parish of Clackmannan in the County of Clackmannanshire – page 3, no., 9, Margaret Dougall, aged 70, died 20 March 1903 (retrieved 6 September 2017)&lt;/ref&gt; The sisters are buried next to each other in the old cemetery in Clackmannan.&lt;ref&gt;Ann Balmain Dougall buried 21 March 1903 – the old cemetery, Clackmannan, section E lair no. 269 aged 64, no. 746, p. 502 in the burial register&lt;/ref&gt; The sisters brother Aeneas Dougall (who died on 24 March 1897) is also buried there.&lt;ref&gt;Aeneas Dougall buried 24 March 1897 – the old cemetery, Clackmannan, section E lair no. 270, no. 433, p. 502 in the burial register&lt;/ref&gt;

John Francon Williams travelled to New York City, leaving on 19 March 1904 from [[Liverpool]] aboard the SS ''Etruria''.&lt;ref&gt;Passenger List, SS Etruria, Liverpool to New York, departing 19 March 1904 – John Francon Williams&lt;/ref&gt; He travelled as a representative for various publishing houses.&lt;ref&gt;On his death certificate J. F. Williams is recorded as an "Export Trade Specialist".&lt;/ref&gt;

John's wife Barbara died in [[Clackmannan]] on 24 November 1909 at the family home, Mains House.&lt;ref&gt;Register of Deaths: 1909, Deaths in the Parish of Clackmannan in the County of Clackmannanshire – p. 10, no. 30, Barbara Balmain Williams, aged 59, died 24 November 1909 from cancer of the liver (retrieved 6 September 2017).&lt;/ref&gt; She was buried alongside her sisters and brother in the old cemetery in Clackmannan.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Balmain Williams buried 27 November 1909 aged 59 – the old cemetery, Clackmannan, section E lair no. 270, no. 1103, p. 502 in the register.&lt;/ref&gt; She died from cancer of the liver.

===The Hawes Junction rail crash===
On Christmas Eve, 24 December 1910, the overnight express train from London to [[Glasgow]] departed at midnight from [[St Pancras Station]], with scheduled stops at [[Manchester]], [[Leeds]], [[Skipton]], etc. The train consisted of four timber-bodied coaches, two sleeping cars and two brake vans and a locomotive. John Francon Williams and his eldest son John Williams Jr. happened to be in Manchester attending to publishing business on 24 December and had arranged to spend Christmas Day with relatives and friends in [[Clackmannan]] in the [[Central Lowlands]] of Scotland. They decided to catch the overnight express train at Manchester, so that they could enjoy Christmas festivities in Clackmannan.

At 19 minutes to six in the morning, close to [[Hawes Junction]], the express train travelling at high speed smashed into an oncoming locomotive. The express train concertina'd and careered off the tracks. Except for two electrically lit sleeping cars, the coaches were lit by the Pintsch oil gas system. The impact broke the gas pipe in one of the front carriages and an explosion followed. Fire spread quickly through the wooden carriages killing twelve trapped and injured passengers.

The ''Dundee Courier'' on Tuesday 27 December in their coverage of the [[Hawes Junction rail crash]] reported: ''The news of the disaster occasioned considerable anxiety to the relatives of Mr John Francon Williams, a prominent and highly-respected resident of Clackmannan. Mr Williams and his eldest son Mr John Williams, were in business in Manchester, and had sent word to their friends in Clackmannan that they intended to travel North with the night express so as to arrive home on Saturday morning for Christmas. The fact that they did not put in an appearance in Clackmannan on Saturday, coupled with the news of the disaster, naturally aroused fears for their safety in the minds of their waiting relatives. Telegraphic communication was opened up with the hotel in Manchester where Mr Williams had been staying, and yesterday (26 December) it was ascertained that, though the father and son had fully intended travelling with the ill-fated express, through pressure of business they had been compelled to postpone their departure till Monday evening, an arrangement, which, in the light of what subsequently occurred, may be regarded as providential.'' &lt;ref&gt;''The Dundee Courier'', Tuesday 27 December 1910, p. 5 – Pathetic Scenes at Hawes Junction During Inquest on Victims of Express Disaster (report) – Clackmannan Gentleman's Providential Escape (retrieved 8 August 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
By 1911 John's landscape had changed dramatically. He was now boarding at 25 St. Stephen's Road, [[Leicester]], with the Grimsley family; widow Fanny Grimsley and her three unmarried daughters, Eliza aged 37, Jane aged 25, and Martha aged 21.&lt;ref&gt;1911 England Census, 25 St. Stephen's Road, Leicester – John Francon Williams (retrieved 27 January 2018)&lt;/ref&gt; Also boarding at the handsome 7-roomed property were four female lodgers. John was at this point in his career working as a Publishers Representative (agent) and still traveling extensively. 

John Francon Williams died from a brain haemorrhage on 4 September 1911 in the County Hospital, [[Alloa]], and is buried in an unmarked grave beside his wife in Clackmannan Cemetery in [[Clackmannanshire]], Scotland.&lt;ref&gt;1911 UK Census, Leicestershire, England. John Francon Williams (aged 57)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Register of Deaths: 1911, Deaths in the Parish of Alloa in the County of Clackmannanshire – page 57, no., 171, John Francon Williams, aged 57, died 4 September 1911 from a brain haemorrhage (retrieved 6 September 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

| ShortSummary=Pig, Goat, Banana, and Mantis live in a semi-isolated cement tree house they inherited from their Old Uncle Robot. They grew up in the tree house, raised by their Uncle, until the trithalium crystals in his cerebrex burned out, causing him to permanently deactivate, leaving them suddenly on their own. Because they all grew up in the same treehouse together, they have developed a really close bond, but they still have very different personalities that often clash in dramatic ways. However, even though they do battle with each other from time to time, they always come together whenever a crisis threatens their home or strange family unit.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3138">'''Mameria''' is an area of high-altitude [[jungle]] to the northeast of the [[Paucartambo, Paucartambo|Paucartambo]] range in southeast [[Peru]], drained by the [[Mameria river]], an affluent of the [[Nistrón river]].  Until the 1960s this remote and sparsely populated area would have been considered a part of the Callanga jungle area.  [[Machiguenga]] peoples, fleeing the slavery that they were subject to along the [[Yavero river]], fled to this area which acquired its current name from the Machiguenga observing that "mameri," which means "there are none," regarding the lack of fish in the river.

Mameria has pre-Columbian stone ruins that are the remains of ancient [[Inca]]n [[coca]] plantations, some of which were sacked by the Peruvian helicopter-borne General [[Ludwig Essenwanger]] in 1980, a year after the area was first brought to the attention of the outside world by the also helicopter-borne expedition made by French-Peruvian explorers [[Herbert Cartagena|Herbert]] and [[Nicole Cartagena]], guided by Peruvian campesino/adventurer Goyo Toledo.  The Cartagena's book, ''Paititi, dernier refuge des Incas'' (1981) recounts their expedition of their search for the lost city of [[Paititi]].

In 1980 Goyo Toledo returned—on foot—to Mameria, the first known person since the ancient Incans to do so.  The next year his brother Gabino, and Guillermo Mamani, made their way to Mameria to look for, and find, Goyo.  In 1983 an architect/adventurer from Cusco, [[César Vilchez]], his nephew [[César Medina]], [[Carlos Cartagena]], and [[Manuel Guevarra]] found their way to Mameria in a grueling two-month journey during which they nearly perished from hunger.  Between 1984 and 1989 the American explorer [[Gregory Deyermenjian]] made five expeditions to Mameria—for three of which he was accompanied by Peruvian explorer [[Paulino Mamani H.]]—conducting anthropological as well as archaeological research concerning the area's Machiguenga inhabitants and ancient archaeological remains.

In the mid-1990s the Peruvian adventurer [[Darwin Moscoso]] made a long journey to Mameria, later producing a fine map of the area.  An in-depth review of the history and archaeology of Mameria can be found in Deyermenjian's article ''Mameria: An Incan Site Complex in the High-Altitude Jungles of Southeast Peru'', in the Volume 3 Number 4 (2003) issue of [[Athena Review]].  Deyermenjian sees Mameria as having functioned as an Incan frontier settlement, providing coca to the Incas of the highlands in pre-Conquest times, which became totally forgotten after the fall of the highland Incas to the Spaniards, protected until even now by its remote location, difficulty of access, and the difficulty of life there.

:'' Redirected here: '''feet above sea level'''
'''Metres above mean sea level''' ('''MAMSL''') or simply '''metres above sea level''' ('''MASL''' or '''m a.s.l.''') is a [[Non-SI units mentioned in the SI|standard]] [[metric system|metric]] [[measurement]] in [[metres]] of the [[elevation]] or [[altitude]] of a location in reference to a historic mean [[sea level]]. Mean sea levels are affected by [[climate change]] and other factors and change over time. For this and other reasons, recorded measurements of elevation above sea level might differ from the actual elevation of a given location over sea level at a given moment.

== Uses ==

Metres above sea level is the standard measurement of the elevation or altitude of:
* [[Geographic location]]s such as [[town]]s, [[mountain]]s and other [[landmark]]s.
* The top of [[building]]s and other [[nonbuilding structure|structure]]s.
* Flying objects such as [[airplane]]s or [[helicopters]].

== How it is determined ==

The elevation or altitude in metres above sea level of a location, object, or point can be determined in a number of ways. The most common include:
* [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS), which triangulates a location in reference to multiple [[Artificial Satellite|satellite]]s.
* [[Altimeter]]s. They typically measure [[atmospheric pressure]], which decreases as altitude increases.
* [[Aerial photography]].
* [[Surveying]].

Accurate measurement of historical mean sea levels is complex. Land mass subsidence (as occurs naturally in some islands) can give the appearance of rising sea levels. Conversely, markings on land masses that are uplifted due to geological processes can suggest a lowering of mean sea level.

== Other measurement systems ==

[[Foot (length)|Feet]] above sea level is the most common analogue for metres above sea level in the US customary measurement system.

== Abbreviations ==

Metres above sea level is commonly abbreviated mamsl or MAMSL, based on the abbreviation AMSL for [[above mean sea level]]. Other abbreviations are m.a.s.l.&lt;ref name="BC"&gt;{{cite journal | last = Ricardo Bressani | first = Ricardo |author2=Carlos Chon | year = 1996 | title = Effects of altitude above sea level on the cooking time and nutritional value of common beans | journal = Plant Foods for Human Nutrition (Formerly Qualitas Plantarum) | volume = 49 | issue = 1 | pages = 53–61 | url = http://www.springerlink.com/index/H05M8274480PJTM4.pdf | accessdate = 2007-05-06 | doi = 10.1007/BF01092522}}&lt;/ref&gt; and MASL.&lt;ref name ="TD"&gt;{{cite web | title = Meters above Sea Level - What does MSL stand for?

[[File:Plunge pool.png|thumb|Water going over the falls carries sand and pebbles that scour a plunge pool at its base.]]

A '''plunge pool''' (or '''plunge basin''' or '''waterfall lake''') is a deep depression in a stream bed at the base of a [[waterfall]] or [[Shut-in (river)|shut-in]]. It is created by the [[erosion|erosional]] forces of cascading water on the rocks at formation's base where the water impacts.&lt;ref name=EG&gt;Marshak, Stephen, 2009, ''Essentials of Geology,'' W. W. Norton &amp; Company, 3rd ed. {{ISBN|978-0393196566}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term may refer to the water occupying the depression, or the depression itself.&lt;ref&gt;Robert L Bates, Julia A Jackson, ed. ''Dictionary of Geological Terms: Third Edition'',  p. 391, [[American Geological Institute]] (1984)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Formation==

Plunge pools are formed by the natural force of falling water, such as at a [[waterfall]] or cascade; they also result  from man-made structures such as some [[spillway]] designs.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=x66ppt1lkHoC&amp;pg=PA105&amp;#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false The Management of the Zambezi River Basin and Kariba Dam], p. 105 (2010)&lt;/ref&gt; Plunge pools  are often very deep, generally related to the height of fall, the volume of water, the resistance of the rock below the pool and other factors.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent J. Zipparro, Hans Hasen, [https://books.google.com.ph/books?redir_esc=y&amp;id=JIJUAAAAMAAJ&amp;focus=searchwithinvolume&amp;q=plunge+pool Davis' Handbook of Applied Hydraulics], p. 16.46 (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; The impacting and swirling water, sometimes carrying rocks within it, [[Abrasion (geology)|abrades]] the riverbed into a basin, which often features rough and irregular sides. Plunge pools can remain long after the waterfall has ceased flow or the stream has been diverted. Several examples of former plunge pools exist at [[Dry Falls]] in the [[Channeled Scablands]] of eastern [[Washington (state)|Washington]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://pubs.usgs.gov/gip/70007447/report.pdf  The Channeled Scablands of Eastern Washington: the geologic story of the Spokane flood ], p.18-19 [[United States Geological Survey]] (1973)&lt;/ref&gt;

Plunge pools are [[fluvial]] features of [[erosion (geology)|erosion ]] which occur in the [[cycle of erosion|youthful stage]] of river development, characterized by steeper [[Stream gradient|gradients]] and faster water flows. Where softer or fractured rock has been eroded back to a [[knickpoint]], water continues to bombard its base. Because this rock is often less resistant than overlying strata, the water from the higher elevation continues eroding downward until an equilibrium is achieved.

A somewhat similar bowl-shaped feature developed by flowing water, as opposed to falling water, is known as a scour hole.  These occur both naturally and as a result of [[Bridge scour|bridge building]].

[[File:Mars, as seen by the Hubble Telescope.jpg|thumb|Polar ice cap on [[Mars]], seen by the [[Hubble Telescope]]]]

A '''polar ice cap''' or '''polar cap''' is a high-[[latitude]] region of a [[planet]], [[dwarf planet]], or [[natural satellite]] that is covered in [[ice]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://nsidc.org/cgi-bin/words/letter.pl?P The National Snow and Ice Data Center Glossary] {{webarchive|url=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090710225721/http://nsidc.org/cgi-bin/words/letter.pl?P |date=10 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are no requirements with respect to size or composition for a body of ice to be termed a polar ice cap, nor any geological requirement for it to be over land; only that it must be a body of solid phase matter in the [[polar region]]. This causes the term "polar ice cap" to be something of a misnomer, as the term [[ice cap]] itself is applied more narrowly to bodies that are over land, and cover less than 50,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;: larger bodies are referred to as [[ice sheets]].

The composition of the ice will vary. For example, [[Earth]]'s polar caps are mainly [[water]] ice, whereas [[Mars]]'s polar ice caps are a mixture of [[Dry ice|solid carbon dioxide]] and water ice.

Polar ice caps form because high-latitude regions receive less energy in the form of [[solar radiation]] from the [[Sun]] than [[equator]]ial regions, resulting in lower surface [[temperature]]s.

Earth's polar caps have changed dramatically over the last 12,000 years. [[Season]]al variations of the ice caps takes place due to varied solar energy absorption as the planet or moon revolves around the Sun. Additionally, in geologic time scales, the ice caps may grow or shrink due to [[climate]] variation.

&lt;/gallery&gt;

===North Pole===
{{see also|Arctic sea ice decline}}
Earth's [[North Pole]] is covered by floating [[pack ice]] ([[sea ice]]) over the [[Arctic Ocean]]. Portions of the ice that do not melt seasonally can get very thick, up to 3–4 meters thick over large areas, with ridges up to 20 meters thick.  One-year ice is usually about 1 meter thick.  The area covered by sea ice ranges between 9 and 12 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. In addition, the [[Greenland ice sheet]] covers about 1.71 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and contains about 2.6 million km³ of ice. When the ice breaks off (calves) it forms icebergs scattered around the northern Atlantic.&lt;ref&gt;

|publisher=nsidc.org
|accessdate=27 March 2008
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the [[National Snow and Ice Data Center]], "since 1979, winter Arctic ice extent has decreased about 4.2 percent per decade". Both 2008 and 2009 had a minimum Arctic sea ice extent somewhat above that of 2007. At other times of the year the ice extent is still sometimes near the 1979–2000 average, as in April 2010, by the data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center.&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web

|title=Arctic Sea Ice News &amp; Analysis
|publisher=National Snow and Ice Data Center
|accessdate=9 May 2010
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;  Still, between these same years, the overall average ice coverage appears to have declined from 8 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; to 5 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

===South Pole===
{{See also|Climate of Antarctica}}
[[File:Antarctica 6400px from Blue Marble.jpg|thumb|A satellite composite image of Antarctica]]
Earth's [[south pole|south polar]] land mass, [[Antarctica]], is covered by the [[Antarctic ice sheet]].  It covers an area of about 14.6 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and contains between 25 and 30 million km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of ice. Around 70% of the [[fresh water]] on Earth is contained in this ice sheet.

Data from the National Snow and Ice Data Center shows that the sea ice coverage of Antarctica has a slightly positive trend over the last three decades (1979–2009).&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historical cases===

Over the past several decades, Earth’s polar ice caps have gained significant attention because of the alarming decrease in land and sea ice. [[NASA]] reports that since the late 1970s, the [[Arctic]] has lost an average of 20,800 square miles (53,900 square kilometers) of ice per year while the [[Antarctic]] has gained an average of 7,300 square miles (18,900 km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of ice per year. On September 19, 2014, for the first time since 1979, Antarctic sea ice extent exceeded 7.72 million square miles (20 million square kilometers), according to the [[National Snow and Ice Data Center]]. The [[ice extent]] stayed above this benchmark extent for several days. The average maximum extent between 1981 and 2010 was 7.23 million square miles (18.72 million square kilometers). The single-day maximum extent in 2014 was reached on Sept. 20, according to [[NSIDC]] data, when the sea ice covered  7.78 million square miles (20.14 million square kilometers). The 2014 five-day average maximum was reached on Sept. 22, when sea ice covered 7.76 million square miles (20.11 million square kilometers), according to [[NSIDC]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Antarctic Sea Ice Reaches New Record Maximum|url=https://www.nasa.gov/content/goddard/antarctic-sea-ice-reaches-new-record-maximum|publisher=NASA Goddard Space Flight Center|accessdate=10 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The current rate of decline of the ice caps has caused many investigations and discoveries on glacier dynamics and their influence on the world’s climate. In the early 1950s, scientists and engineers from the US Army began drilling into polar ice caps for geological insight. These studies resulted in “nearly forty years of research experience and achievements in deep polar [[ice core]] drillings... and established the fundamental drilling technology for retrieving deep ice cores for climatologic archives.” &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Langway|first=Chester|title=The history of early polar ice cores, Cold Regions Science and Technology|date=April 2008|volume=52|issue=2|pages=101–117}}&lt;/ref&gt; Polar ice caps have been used to track current climate patterns but also patterns over the past several thousands years from the traces of CO2 and CH4 found trapped in the ice. In the past decade, polar ice caps have shown their most rapid decline in size with no true sign of recovery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thewatchers.adorraeli.com/2011/03/10/polar-ice-is-melting-more-faster-than-predicted/|title=Polar ice is melting more faster than predicted|publisher=The Watchers|accessdate=18 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Josefino Comiso, a senior research scientist at NASA, found that the “rate of warming in the Arctic over the last 20 years is eight times the rate of warming over the last 100 years.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Thompson |first=Elvia |title=Recent Warming of Arctic May Affect Worldwide Climate |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2003/1023esuice.html |publisher=[[NASA]] |accessdate=2 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September 2012, sea ice reached its smallest size ever. Journalist John Vidal stated that sea ice is "700,000 sq km below the previous minimum of 4.17m sq km set in 2007".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Videl |first=John |title=Arctic Ice Shrinks 18% against Record, Sounding Climate Change Alarm Bells |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2012/sep/19/arctic-ice-shrinks |work=[[The Guardian]] |location=London |accessdate=3 October 2012 |date=19 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In August 2013, Arctic sea ice extent averaged 6.09m km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, which represents 1.13 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; below the 1981–2010 average for that month.&lt;ref&gt;National Snow and Ice Data Center [http://nsidc.org/arcticseaicenews/2013/09/a-real-hole-near-the-pole/ A real hole near the pole], 4 September 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to Earth, the planet [[Mars]] also has polar ice caps.  They consist of primarily water-ice with a few percent dust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | title=North polar deposits of Mars: Extreme purity of the water ice |author1=Grima, Cyril G. |author2=Kofman, W. |author3=Mouginot, J. |author4=Phillips, R.

Data collected in 2001 from NASA missions to Mars show that the southern residual ice cap undergoes sublimation inter-annually.  The most widely accepted explanation is that fluctuations in the planet's orbit are causing the changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2007/02/070228-mars-warming.html | title=Mars Melt Hints at Solar, Not Human, Cause for Warming, Scientist Says | first=Kate | last=Ravilious | work=[[National Geographic News]] | publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] | date=28 February 2007 | accessdate=28 October 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Afghanistan]] is made up of 34 [[province]]s ({{lang|fa|ولايت}} ''[[Wilayah|wilåyat]]''). The '''provinces of Afghanistan''' are the primary [[administrative division]]s. Each province encompasses a number of [[districts of Afghanistan|districts]] or usually over 1,000 villages. 

Provincial governments are led by a [[List of current governors of Afghanistan|governor]] who is appointed by the [[President of Afghanistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ahmed|first=Azam|title=For Afghan Officials, Facing Prospect of Death Is in the Job Description|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/09/world/asia/for-afghan-officials-prospect-of-death-comes-with-territory.html|accessdate=18 June 2013|newspaper=[[New York Times]]|date=December 8, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each province is represented in the [[government of Afghanistan]] by two members in the [[House of Elders]]. One is elected by the provincial council to a four-year term while the second is elected by the district councils to a three-year term. Representation in the [[House of the People (Afghanistan)|House of the People]] is directly from the districts, although in each province, two or more of the representatives must be women. They are appointed by the [[President of Afghanistan]]. 

Provincial governors have played a critical role in the reconstruction of the Afghan state following the creation of the new government under [[Hamid Karzai]].&lt;ref name="auto1"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://doi.org/10.1017/CBO9781139161817.001|title=Building a Theory of Strongman Governance in Afghanistan|last=Mukhopadhyay|first=Dipali|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=43|language=en|doi=10.1017/cbo9781139161817.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to international security scholar, Dipali Mukhopadhyay, many of the provincial governors are former [[warlord]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;s who have been incorporated into the political system.&lt;ref name="auto1" /&gt;

[[File:Goodbye, Glaciers.ogv|thumb|300px|In all, about 25 percent of the ice that melted between 2003 and 2010 occurred in the [[Americas]] (excluding Greenland).]]

The '''retreat of glaciers since 1850''' affects the availability of fresh water for irrigation and domestic use, mountain recreation, animals and plants that depend on glacier-melt, and, in the longer term, the level of the oceans.  Studied by [[glaciologist]]s, the temporal coincidence of [[glacier]] retreat with the measured increase of atmospheric [[greenhouse gas]]es is often cited as an evidentiary underpinning of [[global warming]].  Mid-latitude mountain ranges such as the [[Himalayas]], [[Alps]], [[Rocky Mountains]], [[Cascade Range]], and the southern [[Andes]], as well as isolated tropical summits such as [[Mount Kilimanjaro]] in Africa, are showing some of the largest proportionate glacial losses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]]|title=Graph of 20 glaciers in retreat worldwide|work=Climate Change 2001 (Working Group I: The Scientific Basis)|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/fig2-18.htm|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Thomas Mölg|title=Worldwide glacier retreat|work=RealClimate|url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=129|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Glacier mass balance]] is the key determinant of the health of a glacier.  If the amount of frozen precipitation in the [[accumulation zone]] exceeds the quantity of glacial ice lost due to melting or in the [[ablation zone]] a glacier will advance; if the accumulation is less than the ablation, the glacier will retreat.  Glaciers in retreat will have negative mass balances, and if they do not find an equilibrium between accumulation and ablation, will eventually disappear.

The [[Little Ice Age]] was a period from about 1550 to 1850 when the world experienced relatively cooler temperatures compared to the present.  Subsequently, until about 1940, glaciers around the world retreated as the climate warmed substantially.  Glacial retreat slowed and even reversed temporarily, in many cases, between 1950 and 1980 as global temperatures [[:File:Global monthly temperature record.png|cooled slightly]].&lt;ref name=pelto1&gt;{{cite web|last=Pelto|first=Mauri|title=Recent Global Glacier Retreat Overview|url=http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/glacier_retreat.htm|work=North Cascade Glacier Climate Project|accessdate=February 14, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since 1980, a significant [[global warming]] has led to glacier retreat becoming increasingly rapid and ubiquitous, so much so that some glaciers have disappeared altogether, and the existences of many of the remaining glaciers are threatened.  In locations such as the Andes of South America and Himalayas in Asia, the demise of glaciers in these regions has the potential to affect water supplies in those areas.

The retreat of mountain glaciers, notably in western North America, Asia, the Alps and [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] regions of South America, Africa and [[Indonesia]], provide evidence for the rise in global temperatures since the late 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Intergovernmental panel on climate change|title=2.2.5.4 Mountain glaciers|work=Climate Change 2001 (Working Group I: The Scientific Basis|url=http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/064.htm|accessdate=February 14, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140901175741/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/064.htm|archivedate=September 1, 2014|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=National Snow and Ice Data Center|title=Global glacier recession|work=GLIMS Data at NSIDC|url=http://nsidc.org/data/glims/glaciermelt/index.html|accessdate=February 14, 2015|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080705060036/http://nsidc.org/data/glims/glaciermelt/index.html|archivedate=July 5, 2008|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The acceleration of the rate of retreat since 1995 of key [[outlet glacier]]s of the [[Greenland ice sheet|Greenland]] and [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet|West Antarctic]] [[ice sheet]]s may foreshadow a [[sea level rise|rise in sea level]], which would affect coastal regions.

==Glacier mass balance==

[[File:Glacier Mass Balance.png|thumb|280px|Global glacial mass balance in the last fifty years, reported to the [[World Glacier Monitoring Service|WGMS]] and [[National Snow and Ice Data Center|NSIDC]].

{{Main article|Glacier mass balance}}
The mass balance, or difference between [[glacier ice accumulation|accumulation]] and [[Ablation zone|ablation]] (melting and [[sublimation (chemistry)|sublimation]]), of a glacier is crucial to its survival.&lt;ref name=mote-kaser&gt;{{cite journal|first1=Philip W.|last1=Mote|first2=Georg|last2=Kaser|journal=American Scientist|volume=95|issue=4|year=2007|title=The Shrinking Glaciers of Kilimanjaro: Can Global Warming Be Blamed?|url=http://www.americanscientist.org/issues/pub/2007/4/the-shrinking-glaciers-of-kilimanjaro-can-global-warming-be-blamed/1|pages=318–325|doi=10.1511/2007.66.318}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Climate change]] may cause variations in both temperature and snowfall, resulting in changes in mass balance. A glacier with a sustained negative balance loses equilibrium and retreats. A sustained positive balance is also out of equilibrium and will advance to reestablish equilibrium. Currently, nearly all glaciers have a negative mass balance and are retreating.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Alex S. Gardner|author2=Geir Moholdt|author3=J. Graham Cogley|author4=Bert Wouters|author5=Anthony A. Arendt|author6=John Wahr|author7=Etienne Berthier|author8=Regine Hock|author9=W. Tad Pfeffer|author10=Georg Kaser|author11=Stefan R. M.

Glacier retreat results in the loss of the low-elevation region of the glacier. Since higher elevations are cooler, the disappearance of the lowest portion decreases overall ablation, thereby increasing mass balance and potentially reestablishing equilibrium. If the mass balance of a significant portion of the accumulation zone of the glacier is negative, it is in disequilibrium with the climate and will melt away without a colder climate and or an increase in frozen precipitation.&lt;ref name=hubbard&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hubbard|first1=Bryn|author2=Neil F. Glasser|title=Field Techniques in Glaciology and Glacial Geomorphology|date=May 20, 2005|publisher=Wiley|isbn=978-0470844274|pages=179–198|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Y9MWQT0gdBMC&amp;pg=PA179}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=pelto2&gt;{{cite journal|author=Pelto, M.S.|title=Forecasting temperate alpine glacier survival from accumulation zone observations|journal=The Cryosphere|year=2010|volume=4|issue=1|pages=67–75|url=http://www.the-cryosphere.net/4/67/2010/tc-4-67-2010.pdf|format=PDF|doi=10.5194/tc-4-67-2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Methods for measuring retreat include staking [[Glacier terminus|terminus location]], [[global positioning]] mapping, [[aerial mapping]] and laser [[altimetry]].&lt;ref name=hubbard/&gt;&lt;ref name=clark&gt;{{cite book|last1=Clark|first1=Peter U.|title=Abrupt Climate Change: Final Report, Synthesis and Assessment Product|date=September 28, 2009|publisher=DIANE Publishing Company|isbn=9781437915693|pages=39–45|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=92T2d-0NBkQC&amp;pg=PA39}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key symptom of disequilibrium is thinning along the entire length of the glacier. This indicates a diminishment of the accumulation zone. The result is marginal recession of the accumulation zone margin, not just of the terminus. In effect, the glacier no longer has a consistent accumulation zone and without an accumulation zone cannot survive.&lt;ref name=pelto2/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Mauri S.|last=Pelto|authorlink=Mauri S. Pelto|title=The Disequilibrium of North Cascade, Washington Glaciers 1984–2004|work=In Hydrologic Processes|url=http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/diseqilibrium.html|accessdate=February 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[Easton Glacier]] in Washington state, U.S. will likely shrink to half its size but at a slowing rate of reduction and stabilize at that size despite the warmer temperature over a few decades. However, the [[Grinnell Glacier]] in Montana, U.S. will shrink at an increasing rate until it disappears. The difference is that the upper section of Easton Glacier remains healthy and snow-covered, while even the upper section of the Grinnell Glacier is bare, is melting and has thinned.

Though the glaciers of the Alps have received more attention from glaciologists than in other areas of Europe, research indicates that glaciers in northern Europe are also retreating.

As initial cause for glacier retreat in the alps since 1850, a decrease of the glaciers [[albedo]], caused by industrial [[black carbon]] can be identified.

Details on the retreat of Siberian and Russian Far East glaciers less adequate than in most other glaciated areas of the world. There are several reasons for this, the principal one being that since the collapse of [[Communism]] there has been a large reduction in the number of monitoring stations.&lt;ref name=unep&gt;{{cite web|title=Global Glacier Changes: facts and figures Northern Asia|url=http://www.grid.unep.ch/glaciers/pdfs/6_7.pdf|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme|accessdate=July 17, 2015|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another factor is that in the Verkhoyansk and Cherskiy Ranges it was thought glaciers were absent before they were discovered during the 1940s, whilst in ultra-remote Kamchatka and Chukotka, although the existence of glaciers was known earlier, monitoring of their size dates back no earlier than the end of World War II.&lt;ref name=ananicheva/&gt; Nonetheless, available records do indicate a general retreat of all glaciers in the Altai Mountains with the exception of volcanic glaciers in Kamchatka. [[Sakha Republic|Sakha’s]] glaciers, totaling seventy square kilometers, have shrunk by around 28&amp;nbsp;percent since 1945 reaching several percent annually in some places, whilst in the Altai and Chukotkan mountains and non-volcanic areas of Kamchatka, the shrinkage is considerably larger.&lt;ref name=unep/&gt;

====Himalayas and Central Asia====
[[File:Glacial lakes, Bhutan.jpg|thumb|390px|This [[NASA]] image shows the formation of numerous glacial lakes at the termini of receding glaciers in [[Bhutan]]-[[Himalaya]].]]
The Himalayas and other mountain chains of central Asia support large glaciated regions.

As with glaciers worldwide, those of the greater Himalayan region are experiencing a decline in mass, and researchers claim that between the early 1970s and early 2000s, there had been a 9&amp;nbsp;percent reduction in ice mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Laghari|first1=Javaid|title=Climate change: Melting glaciers bring energy uncertainty|journal=Nature|volume=502|issue=7473|pages=617–618|url=http://www.nature.com/news/climate-change-melting-glaciers-bring-energy-uncertainty-1.14031#/b5|accessdate=November 15, 2015|date=November 11, 2013|doi=10.1038/502617a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Change in temperature has led to melting and the formation and expansion of glacial lakes which could cause an increase in the number of glacial lake outburst floods (GLOFs).

North American glaciers are primarily located along the spine of the Rocky Mountains in the United States and Canada, and the Pacific Coast Ranges extending from northern [[California]] to [[Alaska]]. While [[Greenland]] is geologically associated with North America, it is also a part of the Arctic region. Apart from the few tidewater glaciers such as [[Taku Glacier]], in the advance stage of their [[tidewater glacier cycle]] prevalent along the coast of Alaska, virtually all of those in North America are in a state of retreat. This  rate has increased rapidly since around 1980, and overall each decade since has seen greater rates of retreat than the preceding one. There are also small remnant glaciers scattered throughout the [[Sierra Nevada (U.S.)|Sierra Nevada]] mountains of California and [[Nevada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Huegel|first=Tony|title=Sierra Nevada Byways: 51 of the Sierra Nevada's Best Backcountry Drives (Backcountry Byways)|year=2008|publisher=Wilderness Press|isbn=978-0-89997-473-6|pages=2|url=https://books.google.com/?id=lqF-mz0HMkYC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=remnant+glaciers+in+california#v=onepage&amp;q=remnant%20glaciers%20in%20california&amp;f=false|accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Castor|first=Stephen B.|title=Proceedings of the 39th Forum on the Geology of Industrial Minerals, Nevada|year=2004|publisher=Nevada Bureau of Mines and Geology|pages=192|url=https://books.google.com/?id=zxZpWTnRXpEC&amp;pg=PA192&amp;dq=glaciers+in+the+state+of+nevada#v=onepage&amp;q=glaciers%20in%20the%20state%20of%20nevada&amp;f=false|author2=Keith G, Papke, Richard O.

====Cascade Range====
The [[Cascade Range]] of western North America extends from southern [[British Columbia]] in Canada to northern California. Excepting Alaska, about half of the glacial area in the U.S. is contained within the over 700 glaciers of the [[North Cascades National Park|North Cascades]], a portion of those located between the Canada–US border and [[I-90]] in central [[Washington (U.S. state)|Washington]]. These contain much water as is found in all the lakes and reservoirs in the rest of the state, and provide much of the stream and river flow in the dry summer months, approximating some {{convert|870000|m3|yd3|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Pelto|first=Mauri S.|title=Recent Global Glacier Retreat Overview|url=http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/glacier_retreat.htm|accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Eastonterm.jpg|thumb|250px|The Easton Glacier retreated {{convert|255|m|ft|abbr=on}} from 1990 to 2005.]]
As recently as 1975 many North Cascade glaciers were advancing due to cooler weather and increased precipitation that occurred from 1944 to 1976. By 1987 the North Cascade glaciers were retreating and the pace had increased each decade since the mid-1970s. Between 1984 and 2005 the North Cascade glaciers lost an average of more than {{convert|12.5|m}} in thickness and 20–40&amp;nbsp;percent of their volume.&lt;ref name=pelto2/&gt;

Glaciologists researching the North Cascades found that all 47 monitored glaciers are receding while four glaciers—[[Spider Glacier (Phelps Ridge, Washington)|Spider Glacier]], [[Lewis Glacier (Oregon)|Lewis Glacier]], [[Milk Lake Glacier]] and [[David Glacier]]—have disappeared completely since 1985. The [[White Chuck Glacier]] (near [[Glacier Peak]]) is a particularly dramatic example. The glacier area shrank from {{convert|3.1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in 1958 to {{convert|0.9|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} by 2002. Between 1850 and 1950, the [[Boulder Glacier (Washington)|Boulder Glacier]] on the southeast flank of [[Mount Baker]] retreated {{convert|8700|ft}}. William Long of the United States Forest Service observed the glacier beginning to advance due to cooler/wetter weather in 1953. This was followed by a {{convert|743|m}} advance by 1979.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Mauri S.

This retreat has occurred during a period of reduced winter snowfall and higher summer temperatures. In this region of the Cascades, winter [[snowpack]] has declined 25% since 1946, and summer temperatures have risen 0.7&amp;nbsp;[[Celsius|°C]] (1.2&amp;nbsp;[[Fahrenheit|°F]]) during the same period. The reduced snowpack has occurred despite a small increase in winter precipitation—thus, it reflects warmer winter temperatures leading to rainfall and melting on glaciers even during the winter. As of 2005, 67% of the North Cascade glaciers observed are in disequilibrium and will not survive the continuation of the present climate. These glaciers will eventually disappear unless temperatures fall and frozen precipitation increases. The remaining glaciers are expected to stabilize, unless the climate continues to warm, but will be much reduced in size.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Mauri S.

====U.S. Rocky Mountains====
On the sheltered slopes of the highest peaks of [[Glacier National Park (U.S.)|Glacier National Park]] in [[Montana]], the [[eponymous]] glaciers are diminishing rapidly. The area of each glacier has been mapped for decades by the [[National Park Service]] and the U.S. Geological Survey. Comparing photographs from the mid-19th century with contemporary images provides ample evidence that they have retreated notably since 1850. Repeat photography since clearly show that glaciers such as [[Grinnell Glacier]] are all retreating. The larger glaciers are now approximately a third of their former size when first studied in 1850, and numerous smaller glaciers have disappeared completely. Only 27% of the {{convert|99|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} area of Glacier National Park covered by glaciers in 1850 remained covered by 1993.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=U.S. Geological Survey |title=Glacier Monitoring in Glacier National Park |url=http://www.nrmsc.usgs.gov/research/glaciers.htm |accessdate=April 25, 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130218164617/http://www.nrmsc.usgs.gov/research/glaciers.htm |archivedate=February 18, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers believe that by the year 2030, the vast majority of glacial ice in Glacier National Park will be gone unless current climate patterns reverse their course.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=U.S. Geological Survey, U.S. Department of the Interior | title=Glacier Retreat in Glacier National Park, Montana| url=http://nrmsc.usgs.gov/research/glacier_retreat.htm| accessdate=April 25, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Grinnell Glacier is just one of many glaciers in Glacier National Park that have been well documented by photographs for many decades.

The semiarid climate of [[Wyoming]] still manages to support about a dozen small glaciers within [[Grand Teton National Park]], which all show evidence of retreat over the past 50 years. [[Schoolroom Glacier]] is located slightly southwest of [[Grand Teton]] is one of the more easily reached glaciers in the park and it is expected to disappear by 2025.  Research between 1950 and 1999 demonstrated that the glaciers in [[Bridger-Teton National Forest]] and [[Shoshone National Forest]] in the [[Wind River Range]] shrank by over a third of their size during that period. Photographs indicate that the glaciers today are only half the size as when first photographed in the late 1890s. Research also indicates that the glacial retreat was proportionately greater in the 1990s than in any other decade over the last 100 years. [[Gannett Glacier]] on the northeast slope of [[Gannett Peak]] is the largest single glacier in the [[Rocky Mountains]] south of Canada. It has reportedly lost over 50% of its volume since 1920, with almost half of that loss occurring since 1980. Glaciologists believe the remaining glaciers in Wyoming will disappear by the middle of the 21st century if the current climate patterns continue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Wyoming Water Resources Data System Library | title=Glacial Icemelt in the Wind River Range, Wyoming | url=http://library.wrds.uwyo.edu/wrp/90-16/90-16.html | date=July 11, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Canadian Rockies]], glaciers are generally larger and more widespread than to the south in the Rocky Mountains. One of the more accessible in the Canadian Rockies is the [[Mount Athabasca|Athabasca Glacier]], which is an outlet glacier of the {{convert|325|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} [[Columbia Icefield]]. The Athabasca Glacier has retreated {{convert|1500|m|ft|abbr=on}} since the late 19th century. Its rate of retreat has increased since 1980, following a period of slow retreat from 1950 to 1980. The [[Peyto Glacier]] in [[Alberta]] covers an area of about {{convert|12|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, and retreated rapidly during the first half of the 20th century, stabilized by 1966, and resumed shrinking in 1976.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Canadian Cryospheric Information Network | title=Past Variability of Canadian Glaciers | url=http://www.socc.ca/cms/en/socc/glaciers/pastGlaciers.aspx | accessdate=February 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[Illecillewaet Glacier]] in British Columbia's [[Glacier National Park (Canada)]], part of the [[Selkirk Mountains]] (west of the Rockies) has retreated {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} since first photographed in 1887.

In [[Garibaldi Provincial Park]] in Southwestern [[British Columbia]] over {{convert|505|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, or 26%, of the park, was covered by glacier ice at the beginning of the 18th century. Ice cover decreased to {{convert|297|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} by 1987–1988 and to {{convert|245|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} by 2005, 50% of the 1850 area. The {{convert|50|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} loss in the last 20 years coincides with negative mass balance in the region. During this period all nine glaciers examined have retreated significantly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=J. Koch, B. Menounos  |author2=J.

There are thousands of glaciers in Alaska but only few have been named. The [[Columbia Glacier (Alaska)|Columbia Glacier]] near [[Valdez, Alaska|Valdez]] in [[Prince William Sound]] has retreated {{convert|15|km|mi|abbr=on}} in the last 25 years. Its calved icebergs partially caused the [[Exxon Valdez]] oil spill, when the tanker changed course to avoid the ice tips. The Valdez Glacier is in the same area, and though it does not calve, has also retreated significantly. "A 2005 aerial survey of Alaskan coastal glaciers identified more than a dozen glaciers, many former tidewater and [[Ice calving|calving]] glaciers, including Grand Plateau, Alsek, Bear, and Excelsior Glaciers that are rapidly retreating. Of 2,000 glaciers observed, 99% are retreating."&lt;ref name=pelto5/&gt; Icy Bay in Alaska is fed by three large glaciers—Guyot, Yahtse, and Tyndall Glaciers—all of which have experienced a loss in length and thickness and, consequently, a loss in area.

A large region of population surrounding the central and southern Andes of [[Argentina]] and [[Chile]] reside in arid areas that are dependent on water supplies from melting glaciers. The water from the glaciers also supplies rivers that have in some cases been dammed for [[hydroelectric]] power. Some researchers believe that by 2030, many of the large ice caps on the highest Andes will be gone if current climate trends continue. In Patagonia on the southern tip of the continent, the large ice caps have retreated a {{convert|1|km|mi|abbr=on}} since the early 1990s and {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} since the late 19th century. It has also been observed that Patagonian glaciers are receding at a faster rate than in any other world region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Patagonian ice in rapid retreat |date=April 27, 2000 |publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/3662975.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Northern Patagonian Ice Field]] lost {{convert|93|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} of glacier area during the years between 1945 and 1975, and {{convert|174|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} from 1975 to 1996, which indicates that the rate of retreat is increasing. This represents a loss of 8% of the ice field, with all glaciers experiencing significant retreat. The [[Southern Patagonian Ice Field]] has exhibited a general trend of retreat on 42 glaciers, while four glaciers were in equilibrium and two advanced during the years between 1944 and 1986.  The largest retreat was on [[O'Higgins Glacier]], which during the period 1896–1995 retreated {{convert|14.6|km|mi|abbr=on}}.

Notice the larger terminal lakes, the retreat of the white ice (ice free of moraine cover), and the higher moraine walls due to ice thinning. [[:File:DSCN5238-muller-moraine b.jpg|Photo.]] ]]
In New Zealand, mountain glaciers have been in general retreat since 1890, with an acceleration since 1920. Most have measurably thinned and reduced in size, and the snow accumulation zones have risen in elevation as the 20th century progressed. Between 1971–75 Ivory Glacier receded {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} from the glacial terminus, and about 26% of its surface area was lost. Since 1980 numerous small glacial lakes formed behind the new terminal moraines of several of these glaciers. Glaciers such as Classen, Godley and Douglas now all have new glacial lakes below their terminal locations due to the glacial retreat over the past 20 years. Satellite imagery indicates that these lakes are continuing to expand. There has been significant and ongoing ice volume losses on the largest New Zealand glaciers, including the [[Tasman Glacier|Tasman]], Ivory, Classen, [[Mueller Glacier|Mueller]], Maud, [[Hooker Glacier (New Zealand)|Hooker]], Grey, Godley, Ramsay, [[Murchison Glacier|Murchison]], Therma, [[Volta Glacier|Volta]] and Douglas Glaciers. The retreat of these glaciers has been marked by expanding proglacial lakes and terminus region thinning.  The loss in Southern Alps total ice volume from 1976–2014 is 34&amp;nbsp;percent of the total.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | last=Salinger| first=Jim| last2= Fitzharris |first2= Blair | last3= Chinn |first3= Trevor| author-link = Jim Salinger| title=New Zealand's Southern Alps have lost a third of their ice| journal= [[The Conversation (website)|The Conversation]] | url=http://theconversation.com/new-zealands-southern-alps-have-lost-a-third-of-their-ice-28916| date=July 29, 2014| accessdate=February 18, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several glaciers, notably the much-visited [[Fox Glacier|Fox]] and [[Franz Josef Glacier]]s on New Zealand's [[West Coast, New Zealand|West Coast]], have periodically advanced, especially during the 1990s, but the scale of these advances is small when compared to 20th-century retreat.

==Tropical glaciers==
[[Tropical]] glaciers are located between the [[Tropic of Cancer]] and the [[Tropic of Capricorn]], in the region that lies [[latitude|23° 26′ 22″]] north or south of the [[equator]]. Strictly, a tropical glacier is located within the astronomical [[tropics]]; the area where the annual temperature variation is less than the daily variation, and is within the oscillation area of the [[Intertropical Convergence Zone]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kaser and Osmaton|title=Tropical Glaciers|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge|isbn=978-0-521-63333-8|pages=17–18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tropical glaciers are the most uncommon of all glaciers for a variety of reasons. Firstly, the  regions are the warmest part of the planet. Secondly, the seasonal change is minimal with temperatures warm year round, resulting in a lack of a colder winter season in which snow and ice can accumulate. Thirdly, few taller mountains exist in these regions upon which enough cold air exists for the establishment of glaciers. Overall, tropical glaciers are smaller than those found elsewhere and are the most likely glaciers to show rapid response to changing climate patterns. A small temperature increase of only a few degrees can have almost immediate and adverse effect on tropical glaciers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | first=Raymond| last=Pierrehumbert |authorlink=Raymond Pierrehumbert |title=Tropical Glacier Retreat |work=RealClimate |url=http://www.realclimate.org/index.php?p=157  |date=May 23, 2005| accessdate=March 8, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Near the Equator, ice is still found in East Africa, the Andes of South America and New Guinea.  The retreat of equatorial glaciers has been documented via maps and photographs covering the period from the late 1800s to nearly the present.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hastenrath|first=Stefan|title=Recession of equatorial glaciers : a photo documentation|year=2008|publisher=Sundog Publishing|location=Madison, Wis.|isbn=978-0-9729033-3-2|pages=142|url=http://www.sundogpublishing.com/shop/recession-of-equatorial-glaciers-a-photo-documenation-s-hastenrath/|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130515081904/http://www.sundogpublishing.com/shop/recession-of-equatorial-glaciers-a-photo-documenation-s-hastenrath/|archivedate=2013-05-15|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 99.64% of tropical glaciers are in Andean mountains of South America, 0.25% on the African glaciers of Rwenzori, Mount Kenya and Kilimanjaro, and 0.11% in the Irian Jaya region in New Guinea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Osmaton and Kaser|title=Tropical Glaciers|year=2002|publisher=Cambridge|location=New York|isbn=978-0-521-63333-8|pages=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Almost all Africa is in [[tropical]] and [[subtropical]] climate zones. Its glaciers are found only in two isolated ranges and the [[Ruwenzori Range]]. Kilimanjaro, at {{convert|5895|m|ft|abbr=on}}, is the highest peak on the continent. Since 1912 the glacier cover on the summit of Kilimanjaro has apparently retreated 75%, and the volume of glacial ice is now 80% less than it was a century ago due to both retreat and thinning.&lt;ref name=kilimanjaro4&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.geology.ohio-state.edu/news_detail.php?newsId=1 |title=Snows of Kilimanjaro Disappearing, Glacial Ice Loss Increasing |publisher=Ohio State University |accessdate=August 31, 2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901111936/http://www.geology.ohio-state.edu/news_detail.php?newsId=1 |archivedate=September 1, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In the 14-year period from 1984 to 1998, one section of the glacier atop the mountain receded {{convert|300|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Andrew Wielochowski | title=Glacial recession on Kilimanjaro| url=http://www.kilimanjaro.cc/glacial-recession.htm | date=October 6, 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2002 study determined that if current conditions continue, the glaciers atop Kilimanjaro will disappear sometime between 2015 and 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal  |author=Lonnie G.

To the north of Kilimanjaro lies [[Mount Kenya]], which at {{convert|5199|m|ft|abbr=on}} is the second tallest mountain on the  continent. Mount Kenya has a number of small glaciers that have lost at least 45% of their mass since the middle of the 20th century. According to research compiled by the [[U.S. Geological Survey]] (USGS), there were eighteen glaciers atop Mount Kenya in 1900, and by 1986 only eleven remained. The total area covered by glaciers was {{convert|1.6|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in 1900, however by the year 2000 only about 25%, or {{convert|0.4|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} remained.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=U.S. Geological Survey | title=Glaciers of Africa | work=U.S. Geological Survey Professional Paper 1386-G-3 | format=PDF | url=http://pubs.usgs.gov/prof/p1386g/africa.pdf#search='USGS%20Mount%20Kilimanjaro%20glacier'}}&lt;/ref&gt; To the west of Mounts Kilimanjaro and Kenya, the Ruwenzori Range rises to {{convert|5109|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Photographic evidence indicates a marked reduction in glacially covered areas over the past century. In the 35-year period between 1955 and 1990, glaciers on the [[Rwenzori Mountains]] receded about 40%. It is expected that due to their proximity to the heavy moisture of the [[Congo River|Congo]] region, the glaciers in the Ruwenzori Range may recede at a slower rate than those on Kilimanjaro or in Kenya.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Andrew Wielochowski  | title=Glacial recession in the Rwenzori | url=http://www.kilimanjaro.cc/rwenzoriglaciers.htm | accessdate=July 20, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
A study by glaciologists of two small glaciers in South America reveals another retreat. More than 80% of all glacial ice in the northern Andes is concentrated on the highest peaks in small plains of approximately {{convert|1|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}} in size. A 1992 to 1998 observation of the [[Chacaltaya]] Glacier in [[Bolivia]] and Antizana Glacier in [[Ecuador]] indicate that between {{convert|0.6|m|ft|abbr=on}} and {{convert|1.9|m|ft|abbr=on}} of ice was lost per year on each glacier. Figures for Chacaltaya show a loss of 67% of its volume and 40% of its thickness over the same period. Chacaltaya Glacier has lost 90% of its mass since 1940 and was expected to disappear altogether sometime between 2010 and 2015.

[[Jan Carstensz]]'s 1623 report of glaciers covering the [[List of highest mountains of New Guinea|equatorial mountains]] of [[New Guinea]] was originally met with ridicule, but in the early 20th century at least five subranges of the [[Maoke Mountains]] (meaning "Snowy Mountains") were indeed still found to be covered with large ice caps.  Due to the location of the island within the tropical zone, there is little to no seasonal variation in temperature. The tropical location has a predictably steady level of rain and snowfall, as well as cloud cover year round, and there has been no noticeable change in the amount of moisture which has fallen during the 20th century.

For this mountain there is photographic evidence of massive glacial retreat since the region was first extensively explored by airplane in 1936 in preparation for the [[Carstensz Expedition|peak's first ascent]].

==Polar regions==
Despite their proximity and importance to human populations, the mountain and valley glaciers of tropical and mid-latitude glaciers amount to only a small fraction of glacial ice on the Earth. About 99&amp;nbsp;percent of all freshwater ice is in the great ice sheets of polar and subpolar [[Antarctica]] and [[Greenland]]. These continuous continental-scale ice sheets, {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} or more in thickness, cap much of the polar and subpolar land masses. Like rivers flowing from an enormous lake, numerous outlet glaciers transport ice from the margins of the ice sheet to the ocean.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Kusky|first=Timothy|title=Encyclopedia of Earth and Space Science|year=2010|publisher=Facts on File|isbn=978-0-8160-7005-3|pages=343|url=https://books.google.com/?id=vMk4t21fOvoC&amp;pg=PA343&amp;dq=most+of+the+world's+ice+is+locked+up+in+antarctica+and+greenland#|accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iceland===
The northern Atlantic island nation of [[Iceland]] is home to [[Vatnajökull]], which is the largest ice cap in Europe. The [[Breiðamerkurjökull]] glacier is one of Vatnajökull's outlet glaciers, and receded by as much as {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} between 1973 and 2004. In the early 20th century, Breiðamerkurjökull extended to within {{convert|250|m|ft|abbr=on}} of the ocean, but by 2004 its terminus had retreated {{convert|3|km|mi|abbr=on}} further inland. This glacier retreat exposed a rapidly expanding lagoon, [[Jökulsárlón]], which is filled with icebergs calved from its front. Jökulsárlón is {{convert|110|m|ft|abbr=on}} deep and nearly doubled its size between 1994 and 2004. Mass-balance measurements of Iceland's glaciers show alternating positive and negative mass balance of glaciers during the period 1987–95, but the mass balance has been predominantly negative since. On Hofsjökull ice cap, mass balance has been negative each year from 1995–2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Sveinsson|first=Óli Gretar Blondal|title=XXV Nordic Hydrological Conference|url=http://www.vedur.is/media/vatnafar/saga/NHC2008_volume2_web.pdf|publisher=Nordic Association for Hydrology|accessdate=2011-10-15|format=pdf|date=August 11–13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the Icelandic glaciers retreated rapidly during the warm decades from 1930 to 1960, slowing down as the climate cooled during the following decade, and started to advance after 1970. The rate of advance peaked in the 1980s, after which it slowed down until about 1990. As a consequence of rapid warming of the climate that has taken place since the mid-1980s, most glaciers in Iceland began to retreat after 1990, and by 2000 all monitored non-surge type glaciers in Iceland were retreating. An average of 45 non-surging termini were monitored each year by the Icelandic Glaciological Society from 2000–2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Sigurdsson, Oddur, Trausti Jonsson and Tomas Johannesson| title=Relation between glacier-termini variations and summer temperature in Iceland since 1930| format=PDF| website= | publisher=Hydrological Service, National Energy Authority| url=http://www.igsoc.org/annals/46/a46A210.pdf| accessdate=September 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Northern Europe===
Arctic islands north of Norway, [[Finland]] and Russia have all shown evidence of glacier retreat. In the [[Svalbard]] [[archipelago]], the island of [[Spitsbergen]] has numerous glaciers. Research indicates that Hansbreen (Hans Glacier) on Spitsbergen retreated {{convert|1.4|km|mi|abbr=on}} from 1936 to 1982 and another {{convert|400|m|ft|abbr=on}} during the 16-year period from 1982 to 1998.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Glowacki, Piotr| title=Glaciology and environmental monitoring | work=Research in Hornsund| url=http://hornsund.igf.edu.pl/srodowisko_en.html | accessdate=February 14, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Blomstrandbreen, a glacier in the King's Bay area of Spitsbergen, has retreated approximately {{convert|2|km|mi|abbr=on}} in the past 80 years.

===Greenland===
[[File:Retreat of the Helheim Glacier, Greenland.jpg|thumb|300px|Retreat of the Helheim Glacier, Greenland]]
In [[Greenland]], glacier retreat has been observed in outlet glaciers, resulting in an increase of the ice flow rate and destabilization of the mass balance of the ice sheet that is their source. The net loss in volume and hence sea level contribution of the Greenland Ice Sheet (GIS) has doubled in recent years from {{convert|90|km3|mi3|abbr=on}} per year in 1996 to {{convert|220|km3|mi3|abbr=on}} per year in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Rignot, E.  |author2=Kanagaratnam, P.  |lastauthoramp=yes | title=Changes in the Velocity Structure of the Greenland Ice Sheet| journal=Science| date=February 17, 2006| volume=311| issue=5763| pages=986–990| url=http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/311/5763/986| doi=10.1126/science.1121381| pmid=16484490|bibcode = 2006Sci...311..986R }}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers also noted that the acceleration was widespread affecting almost all glaciers south of 70 N by 2005. The period since 2000 has brought retreat to several very large glaciers that had long been stable. Three glaciers that have been researched—[[Helheim Glacier]], [[Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier]], and [[Jakobshavn Isbræ]]—jointly drain more than 16% of the [[Greenland Ice Sheet]]. In the case of Helheim Glacier, researchers used satellite images to determine the movement and retreat of the glacier. Satellite images and aerial photographs from the 1950s and 1970s show that the front of the glacier had remained in the same place for decades. In 2001 the glacier began retreating rapidly, and by 2005 the glacier had retreated a total of {{convert|7.2|km|mi|abbr=on}}, accelerating from {{convert|20|m|ft|abbr=on}} per day to {{convert|35|m|ft|abbr=on}} per day during that period.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=Ian Howat | title=Rapidly accelerating glaciers may increase how fast the sea level rises | work=UC Santa Cruz,  November 14–27, 2005 Vol. 10, No. 14 | url=http://currents.ucsc.edu/05-06/11-14/glacier.asp |accessdate=November 27, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jakobshavn Isbræ in west Greenland, a major outlet glacier of the Greenland Ice Sheet, has been the fastest moving glacier in the world over the past half century. It had been moving continuously at speeds of over {{convert|24|m|ft|abbr=on}} per day with a stable terminus since at least 1950. In 2002 the {{convert|12|km|mi|abbr=on}} long floating terminus of the glacier entered a phase of rapid retreat, with the ice front breaking up and the floating terminus disintegrating and  accelerating to a retreat rate of over {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} per day. On a shorter timescale, portions of the main trunk of Kangerdlugssuaq Glacier that were flowing at {{convert|15|m|ft|abbr=on}} per day from 1988 to 2001 were measured to be flowing at {{convert|40|m|ft|abbr=on}} per day in the summer of 2005. Not only has Kangerdlugssuaq retreated, it has also thinned by more than {{convert|100|m|ft|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=M Truffer, University of Alaska Fairbanks; M Fahnestock, University of New Hampshire | title=The Dynamics of Glacier System Response: Tidewater Glaciers and the Ice Streams and Outlet Glaciers of Greenland and Antarctica I |url=http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm05/fm05-sessions/fm05_C41A.html | archivedate=April 22, 2006|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060422071200/http://www.agu.org/meetings/fm05/fm05-sessions/fm05_C41A.html|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rapid thinning, acceleration and retreat of Helheim, Jakobshavns and Kangerdlugssuaq glaciers in Greenland, all in close association with one another, suggests a common triggering mechanism, such as enhanced surface melting due to regional climate warming or a change in forces at the glacier front. The enhanced melting leading to lubrication of the glacier base has been observed to cause a small seasonal velocity increase and the release of meltwater lakes has also led to only small short term accelerations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author=S.

Thus, suggests ocean temperature controls ice sheet surface runoff at specific sites. These findings also show that models underestimate the sensitivity of Greenland glaciers to ocean warming and resulting ice sheet runoff. Hence, without better modelling, new observations suggest that past projections of sea level rise attribution from the Greenland Ice Sheet require upward revision.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|journal=Geophysical Research Letters|volume=42 |issue=14 |pages=5909–5917 |author1=Eric Rignot |author2=Ian Fenty |author3=Yun Xu |author4=Cilan Cai |author5=Chris Kemp |year=2015|title=Undercutting of marine-terminating glaciers in West Greenland|doi=10.1002/2015GL064236|url=http://escholarship.org/uc/item/28j711jc|bibcode=2015GeoRL..42.5909R}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Antarctica===
{{See also|List of glaciers in the Antarctic|List of Antarctic ice shelves}}
[[File:Larsen B Collapse.jpg|thumb|250px|The collapsing Larsen B Ice Shelf in [[Antarctica]] is similar in area to the U.S. state of [[Rhode Island]].]]
[[climate of Antarctica|Antarctica]] is intensely cold and arid. Most of the world's freshwater ice is contained within its sheets. Its most dramatic example of glacier retreat is the loss of large sections of the [[Larsen Ice Shelf]] on the [[Antarctic Peninsula]]. The recent collapse of Wordie Ice Shelf, Prince Gustav Ice Shelf, Mueller Ice Shelf, Jones Ice Shelf, Larsen-A and Larsen-B Ice Shelf on the Antarctic Peninsula has raised awareness of how dynamic ice shelf systems are.

The Antarctic sheet is the largest known single mass of ice. It covers almost 14 million km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and some 30 million km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of ice. Around 90% of the fresh water on the planet's surface is held in this area and if melted would raise sea levels by 58 metres.&lt;ref name="IPCC"&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/412.htm#tab113 ''Physical characteristics of ice on Earth'', Climate Change 2001: Working Group I: The Scientific Basis.

The Antarctic sheet is divided by the [[Transantarctic Mountains]] into two unequal sections known as the [[East Antarctic ice sheet]] (EAIS) and the smaller [[West Antarctic Ice Sheet]] (WAIS). The EAIS rests on a major land mass but the bed of the WAIS is, in places, more than 2,500 metres below [[sea level]]. It would be [[seabed]] if the ice sheet were not there. The WAIS is classified as a marine-based ice sheet, meaning that its bed lies below sea level and its edges flow into floating ice shelves. The WAIS is bounded by the [[Ross Ice Shelf]], the [[Ronne Ice Shelf]], and outlet glaciers that drain into the [[Amundsen Sea]].

Ice shelves are not stable when surface melting occurs, and the collapse of Larsen Ice Shelf has been caused by warmer melt season temperatures that have led to surface melting and the formation of shallow ponds of water on the ice shelf.

==Effects of glacier retreat==
{{See also|Deglaciation}}
The continued retreat of glaciers will have a number of different quantitative effects. In areas that are heavily dependent on water runoff from glaciers that melt during the warmer summer months, a continuation of the current retreat will eventually deplete the glacial ice and substantially reduce or eliminate runoff. A reduction in runoff will affect the ability to [[irrigation|irrigate]] crops and will reduce summer stream flows necessary to keep dams and reservoirs replenished. This situation is particularly acute for irrigation in South America, where numerous artificial lakes are filled almost exclusively by glacial melt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Melting glaciers threaten Peru|date=October 9, 2003|publisher=BBC News|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/americas/3172572.stm}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Central Asian]] countries have also been historically dependent on the seasonal glacier melt water for irrigation and drinking supplies. In Norway, the Alps, and the [[Pacific Northwest]] of North America, glacier runoff is important for hydropower.

Some of this retreat has resulted in efforts to slow down the loss of glaciers in the Alps. To retard melting of the glaciers used by certain Austrian ski resorts, portions of the [[Stubai Alps|Stubai]] and Pitztal Glaciers were partially covered with plastic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author1=M.

Many species of freshwater and saltwater plants and animals are dependent on glacier-fed waters to ensure the cold water habitat to which they have adapted. Some species of freshwater fish need cold water to survive and to reproduce, and this is especially true with [[salmon]] and [[cutthroat trout]]. Reduced glacial runoff can lead to insufficient stream flow to allow these species to thrive.  Alterations to the [[ocean currents]], due to increased freshwater inputs from glacier melt, and the potential alterations to [[thermohaline circulation]] of the [[World Ocean]], may affect existing [[fisheries]] upon which humans depend as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Economics of Adapting Fisheries to Climate Change|year=2011|publisher=OECD Publishing|isbn=978-92-64-09036-1|pages=47–55|url=https://books.google.com/?id=FboCKhLSfysC&amp;pg=PA47&amp;dq=increased+glacier+melt+impact+fisheries#v=onepage&amp;q=increased%20glacier%20melt%20impact%20fisheries&amp;f=false|accessdate=2011-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One major concern is the increased risk of [[Glacial Lake Outburst Flood]]s (GLOF), which have in the past had great effect on lives and property.&lt;ref name=unep2&gt;{{cite press release|date=16 April 2002|title=Global Warming Triggers Glacial Lakes Flood Threat|publisher=United Nations Environment Programme|accessdate=14 November 2015|url=http://www.unep.org/Documents.Multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID=245&amp;ArticleID=3042|archive-url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20050526075346/http%3A//www.unep.org/Documents.multilingual/Default.asp?DocumentID%3D245%26ArticleID%3D3042|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 May 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Glacier meltwater left behind by the retreating glacier is often held back by [[moraine]]s that can be unstable and have been known to collapse if breached or displaced by earthquakes, landslides or avalanches.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite report|title=An Overview of Glaciers, Glacier Retreat, and Subsequent Impacts in Nepal, India and China|publisher=WWF Nepal Program|date=March 2005|page=3|url=http://assets.panda.org/downloads/himalayaglaciersreport2005.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; If the terminal moraine is not strong enough to hold the rising water behind it, it can burst, leading to a massive localized flood. The likelihood of such events is rising due to the creation and expansion of glacial lakes resulting from glacier retreat.&lt;ref name=unep2/&gt; Past floods have been deadly and have resulted in enormous property damage. Towns and villages in steep, narrow valleys that are downstream from glacial lakes are at the greatest risk. In 1892 a GLOF released some {{convert|200000|m3|yd3|abbr=on}} of water from the lake of the [[Glacier de Tête Rousse]], resulting in the deaths of 200 people in the French town of [[Saint-Gervais-les-Bains]].&lt;ref name=pelto5&gt;{{cite web|author=Mauri S. Pelto|title=Recent Global Glacier Retreat Overview|url=http://www.nichols.edu/departments/glacier/glacier_retreat.htm|accessdate=August 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; GLOFs have been known to occur in every region of the world where glaciers are located. Continued glacier retreat is expected to create and expand glacial lakes, increasing the danger of future GLOFs.

The potential for major [[sea level rise]] depends mostly on a significant melting of the polar ice caps of Greenland and Antarctica, as this is where the vast majority of glacial ice is located. If all the ice on the polar ice caps were to melt away, the oceans of the world would rise an estimated {{convert|70|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Although previously it was thought that the polar ice caps were not contributing heavily to sea level rise (IPCC 2007), recent studies have confirmed that both Antarctica and Greenland are contributing {{convert|0.5|mm|in}} a year each to global sea level rise.&lt;ref name="pmid17272686"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rahmstorf S, Cazenave A, Church JA |title=Recent climate observations compared to projections |journal=Science |volume=316 |issue=5825 |page=709 |date=May 2007 |pmid=17272686 |doi=10.1126/science.1136843 |url= |bibcode=2007Sci...316..709R|author2=and others |displayauthors=1 |last3=Church |last4=Hansen |last5=Keeling |last6=Parker |last7=Somerville }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Velicogna | first1 = I. | doi = 10.1029/2009GL040222 | title = Increasing rates of ice mass loss from the Greenland and Antarctic ice sheets revealed by GRACE | journal = Geophysical Research Letters | volume = 36 | issue = 19 | pages = L19503 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2009GeoRL..3619503V | citeseerx = 10.1.1.170.8753 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Cazenave | first1 = A. | last2 = Dominh | first2 = K. | last3 = Guinehut | first3 = S. | last4 = Berthier | first4 = E. | last5 = Llovel | first5 = W. | last6 = Ramillien | first6 = G. | last7 = Ablain | first7 = M. | last8 = Larnicol | first8 = G. | doi = 10.1016/j.gloplacha.2008.10.004 | title = Sea level budget over 2003–2008: A reevaluation from GRACE space gravimetry, satellite altimetry and Argo | journal = Global and Planetary Change | volume = 65 | issue = 1 | pages = 83–88 | year = 2009 | pmid =  | pmc = |bibcode = 2009GPC....65...83C | url = https://hal.archives-ouvertes.fr/hal-00401223/document }}&lt;/ref&gt; The fact that the IPCC estimates did not include rapid ice sheet decay into their sea level predictions makes it difficult to ascertain a plausible estimate for sea level rise but recent studies find that the minimum sea level rise will be around {{convert|0.8|m|ft}} by 2100.&lt;ref name="pmid18772435"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Pfeffer WT, Harper JT, O'Neel S |title=Kinematic constraints on glacier contributions to 21st-century sea-level rise |journal=[[Science (journal)|Science]] |volume=321 |issue=5894 |pages=1340–3 |date=September 2008 |pmid=18772435 |doi=10.1126/science.1159099 |url= |bibcode = 2008Sci...321.1340P |last2=Harper |last3=O'Neel }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sugar Loaf''' is a forested mountain in the [[Western Area]] of [[Sierra Leone]] in west [[Africa]]. The capital city of [[Freetown]] is built around its lower slopes. Parts of the mountain are protected as the [[Western Area Forest Reserve]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.visitsierraleone.org/sugar-loaf-mountain/&lt;/ref&gt;

The 19th-century British missionary [[George Thompson (traveller)|George Thompson]] documented his ascent of Sugar Loaf in his 1859 book ''The Palm Land; Or, West Africa, Illustrated''.&lt;ref name="Thompson1859"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Thompson|title=The Palm Land; Or, West Africa, Illustrated.

On Monday 14 August, 2017 in the [[2017 Sierra Leone mudslides]] a landslide triggered by heavy rains swept down one of its flanks and inundated a part of the urban area of [[Regent, Sierra Leone|Regent]] with mud with many deaths reported.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/live/world-africa-40825933&lt;/ref&gt;

{{About|the rock formation in [[New South Wales]] ([[Australia]])|the islands in [[Queensland]] ([[Australia]])|The Three Sisters (Queensland)|other uses|Three Sisters (disambiguation)}}
[[File:blue mountains - three sisters.jpg|thumb|270px|The Three Sisters towering above the [[Jamison Valley]]. The lighter coloured orange/yellow sections indicate fresh rock, exposed by recent erosion.]]

The '''Three Sisters''' are an unusual [[rock formation]] in the [[Blue Mountains (Australia)|Blue Mountains]] of [[New South Wales]], [[Australia]], on the north escarpment of the [[Jamison Valley]]. They are close to the town of [[Katoomba, New South Wales|Katoomba]] and are one of the Blue Mountains' best known sites, towering above the Jamison Valley.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.visitnsw.com/destinations/blue-mountains/katoomba-area/katoomba/attractions/three-sisters-in-the-blue-mountains-national-park|title=Three Sisters in the Blue Mountains - Katoomba|publisher=VisitNSW.com|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their names are Meehni (922&amp;nbsp;m), Wimlah (918&amp;nbsp;m), and Gunnedoo (906&amp;nbsp;m).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluemts.com.au/tourist/thingstodo/threesisters/|title=The Three Sisters|publisher=Stralia Web|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Three Sisters Sunset.jpg|thumb|right|180px|The Three Sisters at sunset]]

==Geology==
The Sisters were formed by land [[erosion]]. The [[Banks Wall Sandstone|sandstone]] of the Blue Mountains was eroded over time by wind, rain and rivers, causing the cliffs surrounding the Jamison Valley to be slowly broken up.

[[File:3SistersandMtSolitary.jpg|thumb|A view of The Three Sisters rock formation alongside Mount Solitary.]]

==Aboriginal legend==
The commonly told legend of the Three Sisters is that three sisters, Meehni, Wimlah and Gunnedoo, lived in the Jamison Valley as members of the Katoomba tribe. They fell in love with three men from the neighbouring Nepean tribe, but [[marriage]] was forbidden by tribal law. The brothers were not happy to accept this [[law]] and so decided to use force to capture the three sisters. A major tribal battle ensued, and the sisters were turned to stone by an elder to protect them, but he was killed in the fighting and no one else could turn them back.  This legend is claimed to be an [[Indigenous Australians|Indigenous Australian]] [[Dreamtime (mythology)|Dreamtime]] legend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Sarzin|first=Anne |title=Myth and meaning in the Blue Mountains |work=UTS: Newsroom &amp;gt; U:Read it |publisher=University of Technology |date=2003-11-03 |url=http://newsroom.uts.edu.au/news/2003/11/myth-and-meaning-in-the-blue-mountains |accessdate=2014-07-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aboriginal traditional owners, the [[Gandangara people|Gundungurra]], have a legend that includes the Sisters rock formation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gundungurra.org.au/|title=Gundungurra Tribal Council Aboriginal Corporation|publisher=Baddog Productions|accessdate=18 November 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Giant Stairway==
From nearby [[Echo Point (lookout)|Echo Point]], a bushwalking trail leads to the Three Sisters and down to the [[valley]] floor via more than 800 well-maintained [[steel]] and stone steps called "the Giant Stairway". Then a 1.5-hour walk on The Federal Pass trail leads to the base of Katoomba Falls and the [[Katoomba Scenic Railway]]. Walkers who don't wish to climb back to the top can take the Scenic Railway back to the plateau for a fee.

'''William A. Libbey III''' (March 27, 1855 – September 6, 1927) was an [[United States|American]] professor of [[physical geography]] at [[Princeton University]]. He was twice a member of the U.S. Olympic Rifle Team, and rose to the rank of [[colonel]] in the [[New Jersey National Guard]]. He is also known for his first ascent of [[Mount Princeton]] in 1877.

==Biography==
[[File:Lewis School Princeton south facade.jpg|thumb|left|Libbey's Princeton home, Thanet Lodge, also known as Greenholm, built in 1902, now home to the [[Lewis School of Princeton]]]]

===Early life===

He was born in [[Jersey City, New Jersey]] to William Libbey, Jr., a wealthy New York City merchant, and Elizabeth Marsh (Libbey).&lt;ref name="GeoGeo"&gt;[http://etcweb.princeton.edu/CampusWWW/Companion/geological_geophysical_sciences_department.html "Geological and Geophysical Sciences, Department of " Princeton University]&lt;/ref&gt;  As an undergraduate at Princeton Libbey was responsible for the adoption of orange and black as the school colors.  During his freshman year he wore a tie, on a dare from classmate Melanchthon Jacobus, with the colors of [[William III of England]], [[House of Orange-Nassau|Prince of Orange-Nassau]], after whom [[Nassau Street (Princeton)|Nassau Street]] had been named in 1724, and later [[Nassau Hall]] in 1756.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bearse|first1=Myrna|title=Princeton: Still Making History|date=2005|publisher=Indigo Custom Publishing|isbn=978-0976287575|page=7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ia5qlL4YCh0C&amp;pg=PA7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The next year he arranged for the manufacture of 1,000 yards of orange and black ribbon and proceeded to sell it, from the [[Grand Union Hotel (Saratoga Springs, New York)|Grand Union Hotel]], at an intercollegiate regatta in [[Saratoga, New York]] as "Princeton's colors."  After the Princeton crew team won, he sold out and orange and black have been Princeton's definitive colors ever since.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Princeton's Colors: The Orange and the Black|url=https://www.princeton.edu/princetoniana/things-princeton/colors-shields/|website=Princetoniana|publisher=Princeton University}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Professor===

Libbey graduated from Princeton in 1877 and that summer went on the Princeton scientific expedition to the [[Western United States|West]].  It was there that on the afternoon of July 17, 1877, at 12:30 pm he reached the summit of Mount Princeton.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.princeton.edu/~paw/archive_old/PAW97-98/02-1008/1008feat1.html Merritt, J. I. (1997) "The Once and Future Mountain" ''Princeton Alumni Weekly'' Princeton University]&lt;/ref&gt; Following his summer in the West, Libbey studied in Berlin and Paris.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.princeton.edu/~paw/archive_old/PAW97-98/02-1008/1008feat1.html#libbey "William Libbey and the 1877 Expedition" ''Princeton Alumni Weekly'' Princeton University]&lt;/ref&gt;

Libbey returned and received his [[doctorate]] in geology in 1879, the first awarded by Princeton.  In 1880 he was appointed as director of the Elizabeth Marsh Museum of Geology and Archaeology as well as an associate professor to teach physical geography.&lt;ref name="GeoGeo"/&gt;  In 1883 he was appointed as a full professor and continued to teach the physical geography classes.&lt;ref name="GeoGeo"/&gt;

In 1897 Libbey was involved with the controversy concerning whether the [[Acoma Pueblo|Acoma]] people had once lived on [[Enchanted Mesa]].  After great exertion, he spent a couple of hours on the mesa top and concluded that nothing was there and that it had never been occupied.  Subsequent work by archaeologists have shown that Libbey's conclusion was hasty.&lt;ref name="Simmons"&gt;[http://www.freenewmexican.com/news/43920.html Simmons, Marc (20 May 2006) "Trail dust: The Enchanted Mesa: myth or true tale?" ''The Santa Fe New Mexican''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080531004304/http://www.freenewmexican.com/news/43920.html |date=May 31, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the [[1912 Summer Olympics]] he won the silver medal as a member of the American team in the team running deer, [[Shooting sports|single shots competition]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.databaseolympics.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=LIBBEWIL01 "William Libbey" profile Olympics database] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070901171121/http://www.databaseolympics.com/players/playerpage.htm?ilkid=LIBBEWIL01 |date=September 1, 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

Libbey died in [[Princeton, New Jersey]].

The service provides detailed maps of the whole world. It includes a search, information about traffic jams, routing and [[Yandex Panoramas|street panoramas]]. The service was launched in 2004.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gpsbusinessnews.com/GPS-phones-generate-traffic-information-in-Russia_a1206.html|title=GPS phones generate traffic information in Russia|first=Ludovic|last=Privat|website=Gpsbusinessnews.com|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Yandex Maps is the most popular cartographic service in [[Russia]]. It has about 11.5 million users in Russia per month, and over 20 million worldwide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://comments.ua/world/225794-yandeks-zapustil-georeklamu.html|title="Яндекс" запустил георекламу|website=Comments.ru|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mediaplanerist.ru/maps.yandex/|title=Реклама на Яндекс.Карты.ru|website=Mediaplanerist.ru|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://semsocial.ru/polzovateli-yandeksa-mogut-redaktirovat-karti-08042015-1951] {{dead link|date=October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://1prime.ru/Transport_communications/20111206/753277953.html|title=Панорамные снимки еще десяти городов России опубликованы на "Яндекс.Картах"|website=1prime.ru|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
The service initially had maps only of Russia and Ukraine, but now includes world maps.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

Maps are available in four versions: maps, [[Satellite imagery|satellite images]], satellite images with captions, and legend (hybrid).

Users can measure distance and get directions by dragging between spots on a map.&lt;ref name="bettertechtips.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bettertechtips.com/internet/google-maps-alternatives/#7Yandex_Map|title=9 Map Apps Alternative to Google Maps|date=22 June 2017|website=Bettertechtips.com|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The search is available by both geographical objects (addresses, streets, cities, regions and countries) and by organizations. The illumination of the district, city or region is available after searching the organization on the site.

Yandex Maps has a mobile application for [[Apple iOS|iOS]], Android and Windows phones.&lt;ref name="bettertechtips.com"/&gt;

Yandex Traffic is a feature on Yandex Maps that displays traffic conditions in [[Real-time data|real time]] on major roads and highways. It can be viewed at the Yandex Maps website, or via the app.

Yandex Traffic works by analyzing the GPS-determined locations transmitted to Yandex by a large number of mobile phone users. By calculating the speed of users along a length of road, Yandex is able to generate a live traffic map. It processes the incoming raw data about mobile phone device locations, and then excludes anomalies such as a postal vehicle that makes frequent stops. When a threshold of users in a particular area is noted, the overlay along roads and highways on the map changes color.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.pl/books?id=pOsODAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA62&amp;lpg=PA62&amp;dq=Yandex+traffic&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=iwzReIzLyU&amp;sig=xVHWubQAZaSPDPhbSypQwfghqDM&amp;hl=pl&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwikyteN-5DXAhUjJJoKHRtDAFIQ6AEIajAJ#v=onepage&amp;q=Yandex+traffic&amp;f=false|title=Encyclopedia of E-Commerce Development, Implementation, and Management|first=Lee|last=In|date=31 March 2016|publisher=IGI Global|accessdate=27 October 2017|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gorod.afisha.ru/people/kto-sostavlyaet-karty-yandeksprobok/|title=Афиша Город: Кто составляет карты "Яндекс.Пробок" – Архив|website=Gorod.afisha.ru|accessdate=27 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Zealand''' ({{lang-da|Sjælland}}, {{IPA-da|ˈɕɛˌlanˀ|pron}}), at 7,031&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, is the largest and most populous [[islands of Denmark|island]] in [[Denmark proper]] (thus excluding [[Greenland]] and [[Disko Island]], which are larger). Zealand has a population of 2,302,074 (as of 1 January 2018).&lt;ref&gt;[http://statistikbanken.dk/statbank5a/SelectVarVal/Define.asp?Maintable=BEF4&amp;PLanguage=1 BEF4: Population 1 January by Islands], Statistics Denmark&lt;/ref&gt;

It is the [[List of European islands by area|13th-largest island in Europe]] by area and the [[List of European islands by population|4th most populous]]. It is connected to [[Funen]] by the [[Great Belt Fixed Link]], to [[Lolland]], [[Falster]] (and Germany from 2028) by the [[Storstrøm Bridge]] and the [[Farø Bridges]]. Zealand is also linked to [[Amager]] by several bridges. Zealand is linked indirectly, through intervening islands by a series of bridges and tunnels, to southern [[Sweden]].

[[Copenhagen]], the capital of Denmark, is located partly on the eastern shore of Zealand and partly on the island of [[Amager]]. Other cities on Zealand include [[Roskilde]], [[Hillerød]], [[Næstved]] and [[Helsingør]]. 

Despite their identical names, the island is not connected historically to the Pacific nation of [[New Zealand]], which is named after the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] province of [[Zeeland]].

==Etymology==
The exact origin of the Danish name "Sjælland" is controversial. ''Sjæl'' in Danish today means "soul", but based on older records one can exclude this interpretation. Even a derivation derived from ''siô / sæ'' (meaning "sea") corresponding closely to the English name is today largely rejected{{clarify span|text= – but it may be that the English name predated Danish research on its origin, compared with the current understanding; So the Danes themselves assumed that the name means "Zealand"|explain=As written, I'm afraid this is simply incoherent |date=September 2018}}. The prevailing view today is: The Old Danish form "Siâland" comes from a composition of the word *''selha-'' with the ending *''wundia-''. The latter means "indicates, resembles". The word *''selha-'' can have two different meanings: it can mean on the one hand "seal" (in modern Danish ''sæl'') and on the other hand mean "deep bay, fjord". Since the main settlement on Zealand was previously Roskilde, which is only accessible by sea through the narrow [[Roskilde Fjord]] (branched from the [[Ise Fjord]]), it is usually assumed that the sailors named the island after this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sprogmuseet.dk/ordhistorier/sj%C3%A6lland/|title=Sjælland …|last=Katlev|first=Jan|date=4 August 2009|website=www.sprogmuseet.dk|language=Danish|publisher=Danish Language Museum|accessdate=29 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mythological origins==
[[File:Gefion.jpg|thumb|left|[[Gefion Fountain|Gefion]] carving Zealand from [[Sweden]].]]
In [[Norse mythology]] as told in the ''[[Gylfaginning]]'', the island was created by the goddess [[Gefjon|Gefjun]] after she tricked [[Gylfi]], the king of Sweden. She removed a piece of land and transported it to Denmark, which became Zealand. The vacant area was filled with water and became [[Mälaren]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Den Store Danske Encyklopædi]], article ''Gefion''&lt;/ref&gt; However, since modern maps show a similarity between Zealand and the Swedish lake [[Vänern]], it is sometimes identified as the hole left by Gefjun.

==Geography==
Zealand is the most populous Danish island. It is irregularly shaped, and is north of the islands of [[Lolland]], [[Falster]], and [[Møn]]. The small island of Amager lies immediately east.

Copenhagen is mostly on Zealand but extends across northern Amager. A number of bridges and the [[Copenhagen Metro]] connect Zealand to Amager, which is connected to [[Scania]] in [[Sweden]] by the [[Øresund Bridge]] via the artificial island of [[Peberholm]]. Zealand is joined in the west to Funen, by the Great Belt Fixed Link, and Funen is connected by bridges to the country's mainland, [[Jutland]].

On June 5, 2007, the regional subsidiary of national broadcaster [[DR (broadcaster)|DR]] reported that [[Kobanke]] in the southeast near the town [[Rønnede]] in [[Faxe Municipality]], with a height of {{convert|122.9|m}}, was the highest natural point on Zealand. [[Gyldenløveshøj]], south of the city [[Roskilde]], has a height of {{convert|126|m}}, but that is due to a man-made hill from the [[17th century]] and its highest natural point is only {{convert|121.3|m}}.

Zealand gives its name to the [[Selandian]] era of the [[Paleocene]].
