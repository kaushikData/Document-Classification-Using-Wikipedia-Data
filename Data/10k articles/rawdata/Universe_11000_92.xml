      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5763">[[Image:Backsaws.jpg|thumb|300px|right|Three backsaws: dōzuki (top), Gent's saw and Tenon saw]]

A '''backsaw''' is any [[hand saw]] which has a stiffening rib on the edge opposite the [[Blade|cutting edge]], enabling better control and more precise cutting than with other types of saws. Backsaws are normally used in [[woodworking]] for precise work, such as cutting [[Dovetail joint|dovetails]], [[miter joint|mitres]], or [[mortise and tenon|tenons]] in [[cabinet making|cabinetry]] and [[joiner]]y. Because of the stiffening rib, backsaws are limited in the depth to which they can cut. Backsaws usually have relatively closely spaced teeth, often with little or no set.

==Types of backsaws==

Backsaws include the '''tenon saw''', the '''dovetail saw''', and the (United Kingdom) '''sash saw'''&lt;sup id="fn_1_back"&gt;[[#fn 1|1]]&lt;/sup&gt;. Tenon and dovetail saws usually have a [[pistol grip]] style handle which may be open or closed at the bottom.  

Different types of backsaw include:
* '''[[Miter saw|Mitre saw]]''' – often referred to as a large backsaw (20–30 inches or 60–90&amp;nbsp;cm) used either in a wooden or metal [[mitre box]] or in a metal frame which allowed cutting mitres of any specified angle. Note that not all mitre saws are backsaws, and the electric mitre saw (or chop saw) has largely taken its place today.
* '''Tenon saw''' – a midsized backsaw. The saw derives its name from its use in the cutting of tenons for [[mortise and tenon]] joinery. Tenon saws are commonly available with rip-filed teeth for rip cutting and cross-cut for cutting across the grain. Teeth are relatively fine, with 13 teeth per inch being a common size for the saw.
* '''Sash saw''' – name that seems to have been used in the 18th and 19th century for a smaller tenon saw, used in fabricating [[window sash]]es. The term is also used currently to refer to a thin, flexible saw used to free sashes that have been painted shut.
* '''Dovetail saw''' – a small backsaw used to cut [[dovetail joint|dovetails]]. These saws will usually have a higher number of teeth per inch (around 15 - 20 T.P.I.) with teeth sharpened in a rip tooth pattern and minimal set to leave a narrow kerf. This fine rip tooth pattern also works well in cross cutting operations.
* '''Gent's saw''' or '''Gentleman's saw''' (rare) – a small dovetail saw with a straight turned handle, rather than an open one typical of most saws. The name seems to have arisen from its use by the nineteenth century dilettante who would now be called a [[hobby]]ist but it is hard to find a nineteenth century reference to it. For example, in the section on tools in ''Every Man his own Mechanic'' (1881) (816pp), tenon, dovetail and [[sash saw]]s are listed as a group but there is no mention of a gent's saw. It is adapted for use in making joints in very small woodwork such as that in some [[musical instrument]]s, [[Doll|dolls' furniture]] or other [[Scale model|model-making]]. Its distinguishing features are its small size and turned handle.
* '''Razor saw''' – a very small backsaw having very finely pitched [[Crosscut saw|crosscut]] teeth, often with no set. The Razor saw is used by hobbyists, notably [[Model aircraft]], [[Model yachting|boat]], and [[Rail transport modelling|railroad]] enthusiasts. Razor saws typically use disposable blades (or are occasionally designed to be completely disposable), since their teeth are so small as to be impractical to re-sharpen. A razor saw is capable of making clean cuts in very soft woods like [[Balsa]], which most other saws would tend to tear out.  Unlike most other types of backsaws, razor saws are also frequently used to cut plastics and soft metals.
* '''Dōzuki''' – a [[japanese saw|Japanese backsaw]], used for centuries by carpenters and cabinetmakers in Japan. Although this saw does not share an ancestry with the other backsaws in this group, the concept is the same. Like most Japanese saws, the dōzuki cuts on the pull stroke, allowing much straighter and narrower cuts than those achieved with push-stroke saws.  This is due to tension on the blade during the cut (versus compression for a western saw), so less thickness is required to keep the saw blade straight.

==Design==
[[File:Backsaw.jpeg|thumb|300px|Flush-cutting Backsaw, handle can be turned to the other side]]
The work of a backsaw requires a thin, stiff blade. These two immediately incompatible requirements are resolved by [[Swage|swaging]] (and perhaps, [[spot welding]]) a stiffening cap over the length of the top edge of the blade. This thickening of the blade is the back and is generally made from some kind of metal, usually brass or steel. The stiffening back is carried through into the handle so that the blade does not bend between the two. The thickening of the back limits the depth to which the saw can cut but this is generally not a limitation in their typical uses.

==Associated tools==
* A backsaw is often used in combination with a [[mitre box]] to produce precisely angled cuts.
* Another accessory commonly used is the [[bench hook]].
* Another tool associated with the use of backsaws is the [[marking knife]]. This leaves a cleaner line than a pencil would and it cuts the fibres at the surface of the wood. Without this, the action of the saw would lift them and leave a ragged edge.

[[File:Drill - Hole Types.png|thumb|Hole types: blind (left), through (middle), interrupted (right).]]
A '''blind hole''' refers to a hole that is [[reamer|ream]]ed, [[drill]]ed, or [[Milling machine|milled]] to a specified depth without breaking through to the other side of the workpiece. The etymology is that it is not possible to see through a ''blind'' hole. Other types of holes also include [[through hole]]s, and [[wiktionary:clearance hole|clearance hole]]s. In this instance blind may also refer to any feature that is taken to a specific depth, more specifically referring to internally [[Screw thread|thread]]ed hole (tapped holes). Not considering the drill point, the depth of the blind hole, conventionally, may be slightly deeper than that of the threaded depth.

There are three accepted methods of threading blind holes:
# Conventional [[Taps and Dies|tapping]], especially with bottom taps
# [[Threading (manufacturing)#Single-point threading|Single-point threading]], where the workpiece is rotated, and a pointed cutting tool is fed into the workpiece at the same rate as the pitch of the internal thread. Single-pointing inside a blind hole, like [[Boring (manufacturing)|boring]] inside one, is inherently more challenging than doing so in a through hole. This was especially true in the era when manual machining was the only method of control. Today, [[Numerical control|CNC]] makes these tasks less stressful, but nevertheless still more challenging than with through holes.
# Helical interpolation, where the workpiece remains stationary and CNC control moves a [[milling cutter]] in the correct helical path for a given thread, milling the thread.

==Machine tools used for threading blind holes==
At least two U.S. tool manufacturers have manufactured tools for [[Threading (manufacturing)#Thread milling|thread milling]] in blind holes: Ingersoll Cutting Tools of Rockford, Illinois, and Tooling Systems of Houston, Texas, who introduced the ThredMil in 1977, a device that milled large internal threads in the blind holes of oil well [[blowout preventer]]s. Today many CNC milling machines can run such a thread milling cycle (see a video of such a cut in the "External links" section).

The '''Buick Regal''' is an upscale [[mid-size]]d [[car|automobile]] that was first introduced by [[Buick]] for the 1973 model year. [[North America]]n production ended in 2004 and began again in 2011. For the 2011 model year, [[Buick]] re-introduced the Regal to the [[North America]]n market, positioned as an upscale [[sports sedan]].&lt;ref name="gm2011"&gt;{{cite press release|date=2009-11-12|url=http://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/news/news_detail.brand_gm.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2009/Nov/1112_GM_Buick_Regal|publisher=GM Media Online|title=The 2011 Regal: A Buick Bred On The Autobahn}}&lt;/ref&gt; Production and sales in [[China]] have continued since 1999.&lt;ref name="Wards05"/&gt;

For certain model years between 1973 and 2004, the Regal shared bodies and powertrains with the similar [[Buick Century]]. The two most recent generations (2011–present) are North American market versions of the [[Opel Insignia]], known as the [[Vauxhall Motors|Vauxhall]] Insignia in the [[United Kingdom|UK]].

[[File:Nona6.jpg|thumb|left|1973 Buick Regal coupe]]

[[File:Buick-Regal-(A-body)-Vilnius-Lithuania-back.jpg|thumb|left|1976 Buick Regal sedan (rear view)]]

[[Buick]] had been the first GM division to bring a [[personal luxury car]] to market with its full-size 1963 [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]], but was otherwise slow to react to the developing lower-priced mid-size personal luxury market, which [[Pontiac]] created with the 1969 [[Pontiac Grand Prix|Grand Prix]] and [[Chevrolet]] with the [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo|Monte Carlo]] the following year, 1970. At the same time, [[Oldsmobile]] added a formal notchback coupé to its intermediate line, the [[Cutlass Supreme]], in 1970 and that model soon became Olds' best selling intermediate. Buick did not get its own personal luxury coupe until the GM intermediates were redesigned in 1973, the so-called "Colonnade" cars that eliminated hardtop models completely. In a curious name swap, the Skylark name was dropped from Buick's intermediate line and instead the Century nameplate, last used in the 1950s, was revived for them.

A highly trimmed, two-door [[coupe]], the first Regal shared its front and rear styling with its Century parent with distinctions amounting to differing grilles and taillight lenses. The Regal shared the same "Colonnade" [[Hardtop|pillared hardtop]] roofline (a [[hardtop]] with [[Pillar (car)|B-pillars (center pillars)]] but frameless doors unlike a sedan body) and greenhouse (window area) with the Grand Prix, Monte Carlo, and Cutlass Supreme as well as the lower-priced Buick Century Luxus coupe. Like its corporate cousins, the Regal (and Luxus) featured the newly fashionable opera windows, which were small fixed rear-side windows surrounded by sheetmetal, instead of the traditional roll-down windows.

For the first [[model year]] in 1973, the Regal nameplate was only used for Buick's version of the GM intermediate [[personal luxury car|personal luxury]] [[coupe]], but the following year gained a [[sedan (car)|sedan]] companion (there was no Regal [[station wagon]]).

Regal interiors were generally more luxurious than lesser Century models with woodgrain trim on [[dashboard]] and [[door panel]]s, along with door-pull straps and [[bench seat]]s with center [[armrest]]s with cloth, velour, or vinyl upholstery. Optionally available throughout the run was a 60/40 split bench seat with [[armrest]]. For 1976 and 1977, the Regal [[coupé|coupe]] was available with the S/R option that included reclining bucket seats with corduroy upholstery.

The model lasted five years with minimal changes, although there was a fairly substantial facelift in coupes for 1976 (sedans retained their original 1973 sheetmetal through 1977), which incorporated the recently-legalized square headlights (horizontally mounted on coupes, and vertically on [[sedan (car)|sedan]]s—much like the mid-1960s Pontiacs). The Regal coupe sold reasonably well, although it lagged behind the Monte Carlo and Cutlass Supreme which had become the best-selling cars in America by 1976.

The Regal was most commonly powered by [[Buick V8 engine#350|Buick's 350&amp;nbsp;in³ V8]], which was standard equipment on all models for 1973 and 1974, and optional on coupes but standard on sedans from 1975 to 1977, and the larger [[Buick V8 engine#455|455 cu&amp;nbsp;in V8]] was optional for 1973 and 1974 models only. Starting in 1975, Regal coupes came standard with Buick's resurrected {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V6 engine]] previously offered on the 1964–1967 [[Buick Skylark|Skylark]]; the engine's tooling had been sold to [[Kaiser Motors]] for use in [[Jeep]] models (Kaiser was purchased by American Motors in 1970 and Jeep became an AMC division) and sold back to GM by AMC in 1974. For 1975 and 1976, the Century and Regal were the only mid-sized cars in America to offer V6 engines. The bolt pattern for this vehicle is 5×{{convert|4+3/4|in|mm|1}}.

The Century designation was quietly dropped from the Regal for 1975.

A downsized Regal appeared for the 1978 model year with Buick's new {{convert|196|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} [[V6 engine]] as standard equipment and a revised version of the venerable {{convert|231|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} V6 as an option (which became standard for 1980). Initially, a 3-speed [[manual transmission]] was standard but this was later replaced by an automatic. This model lasted 10 years. The base model was equipped with softer-riding luxury [[Suspension (vehicle)|suspension]], and did not offer a manual transmission in later years.

[[File:Buick Regal -- 08-14-2009.jpg|thumb|left|1978–1979 Buick Regal]]
[[File:Regal A-Body.JPG|thumb|left|1980 Buick Regal]]
[[File:Buick Regal G-Body.jpg|thumb|left|1982–1987 Buick Regal]]

The 1978 Regal could be equipped with a {{convert|3791|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} [[Turbocharged]] V6 engine with [[automatic transmission]] and the [[Sedan (automobile)|sedan model]] was dropped, once again leaving Regals exclusively as [[coupé]]s with the [[Buick Century|Century]] nameplate applied to bread-and-butter sedans and [[station wagon]]s. Non-turbo versions were offered with either a 2-bbl or a 4-bbl [[carburetor]].  The [[Buick LeSabre]] was also available with the turbocharged engine. The only other turbocharged cars available in the U.S. market in 1978 were imports from [[Mercedes-Benz]], [[Porsche 930|Porsche]] and [[Saab Automobile|Saab]]. The Turbo Regal also included a firm [[Car handling|handling]] suspension with larger tires and sport [[Rim (wheel)|wheels]].

A major facelift for 1981 gave the Regal a much more aerodynamic profile, helping make it possible for the car to compete on the [[NASCAR]] racing circuit.  The sloping [[Hood (car)|hood]] and nose of the car made it the favorite of several NASCAR teams. [[Richard Petty]] drove one to victory in the [[1981 Daytona 500]], and the car won a majority of the 1981 and 1982 seasons races and won the NASCAR manufacturers title in 1981 and 1982. [[V8 engine|V8]]s for street use were still available, but had shrunk to {{convert|265|cuin|L|1|abbr=on}} (1980 and 1981 only, [[Pontiac]] built), and the V6 was rapidly gaining popularity. In January 1982, a new Century appeared on the [[front-wheel drive]] [[GM A platform (FWD)|A-body]], but the former [[rear-wheel drive]] Century sedan and wagon were not discontinued. These models were simply [[Badge|rebadged]] as Regals, and for the first time the name appeared on a full model lineup. The wagon was discontinued after 1983, and the sedan dropped from the lineup the next year. From 1986 to 1987, the [[Oldsmobile V8 engine#307|{{convert|307|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V8]] was available as an option. The {{convert|3791|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} 2-bbl V6 was standard. The [[Turbo-Hydramatic#THM200-4R|200-4R]] [[Overdrive (mechanics)|overdrive]] [[Transmission (mechanics)|transmission]] was an option with either engine.

=== Somerset Limited Edition ===
For 1980, the Regal was offered in a special Somerset Limited Edition [[Trim level (automobile)|trim]] which featured unique tan and dark blue designer exterior paint, wire wheel covers, sport [[Wing mirror|mirrors]], and chrome Somerset badging. The interior had tan and blue plush [[velour]] [[Upholstery#Automobile upholstery|upholstery]], brushed [[Chrome plating#Automotive use|chrome]] trim, and additional Somerset badging.

A Somerset Limited Edition model was also offered on the restyled 1981 Regal. It had unique dark sandstone and camel exterior paint, sport mirrors, and turbine wheels. The interior plush velour upholstery was camel with dark brown piping.

=== Grand National, Turbo-T, T-Type, and GNX ===
In February 1982, the Regal Grand National debuted, which was named for the [[NASCAR Sprint Cup Series|NASCAR Winston Cup Grand National Series]] (the "Grand National" term was part of the Cup series nomenclature until 1986).&lt;ref&gt;http://legendarydreamcargarage.com/dreamcargarage/539&lt;/ref&gt; Buick had won the Manufacturers Cup in 1981 and 1982, and wanted to capitalize on its success: "What wins on Sunday, sells on Monday". These 1982 cars were not painted black, which may confuse those not familiar with them. All started out as charcoal gray Regals that were shipped off to a subcontractor for finishing.

Originally intended for a run of 100 units, Cars and Concepts of [[Brighton, Michigan]], retrofitted 215 Regals with the GN package. Most obvious was the light silver gray firemist paint added to each side. Red [[Pinstriping#Automobiles|pinstripes]] and billboard shadow lettering proclaiming "Buick" were applied. The wheel opening moldings and [[rocker panel]] moldings were blacked out using black vinyl tape. Finally, a front air dam and [[rear spoiler]] were installed. On the inside, special "Lear-Siegler" seats were installed. These seats are fully adjustable and were covered with silver brandon cloth with black vinyl inserts. The front seat had Buick's "6" emblem embroidered onto them. Also, a special clock delete plate was added to the [[Dashboard|instrument panel]] which contained the yellow and orange "6" logo and the words "Grand National Buick Motor Division".)

The 1982 GN came with a [[naturally aspirated]] {{convert|252|CID|L|1|abbr=on}} V6 engine with {{convert|125|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000 rpm and {{convert|205|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of [[torque]] at 2,000 rpm. Of the 215 Regal Grand Nationals produced in 1982, at least 35 were based on the Buick Regal Sport coupe package with the turbocharged {{convert|3791|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} V6 engine with {{convert|175|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000 rpm and {{convert|275|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 2,600 rpm. There were only 2,022 Sport coupes produced in 1982, and the number of cars with both the GN and Sport coupe packages is estimated to be fewer than 50.

For 1983, there was no Grand National. The Sport coupe model was renamed the [[T-Type]]; 3,732 were produced ({{convert|190|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 1,600 rpm and {{convert|280|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 2,400 rpm). The T-Type had been used on other Buicks, starting with the [[Buick Riviera|Riviera]] in 1981 (in 1979 and 1980, it was the S Type).  The 1983 Regal T-Type featured tube [[Exhaust manifold|headers]], Hydro-Boost II [[brake]]s, 200-4R 4-speed overdrive trans and 3.42 [[rear axle]] (7.5").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autotraderclassics.com/car-article/Future+Collectible%3A+1986+Buick+Grand+National*T_Type-66683.xhtml |title=Buick Grand National Buyer's Guide |publisher=Autotraderclassics.com |date= |accessdate=2010-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Buick T-Type (2669441886).jpg|thumb|Buick Regal T-Type]]

For 1984, the Grand National returned, now in all black paint. The [[turbocharged]] {{convert|3791|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on}} became standard and was refined with [[sequential fuel injection]], [[distributor]]-less computer controlled [[Ignition system|ignition]], and boasted {{convert|200|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,400 rpm and {{convert|300|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 2,400 rpm. Only 5,204 turbo Regals were produced that year, only 2,000 of which were Grand Nationals. Because this was the first year production of the computer controlled  sequential fuel injection and distributor-less ignition, this is often considered the year and model that started the development of the legendary [[intercooled]] Grand Nationals.  The performance of this package was well ahead of its time and the "little V6" easily kept up with the bigger V8s. [[Dragstrip|{{convert|1/4|mi|m|0}}]] performance was listed at 15.9 seconds at stock boost levels of {{convert|10|psi|bar|abbr=on}}, while for the same year, the [[Chevrolet Camaro (third generation)|Chevrolet Camaro]] was listed at 17.0 and the [[Chevrolet Corvette (C4)|Chevrolet Corvette]] at 15.2 seconds.&lt;ref name=cd_corvette&gt;

|publisher=Car and Driver
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon, performance enthusiasts determined the modifications that worked and the Grand Nationals easily broke into the 13-second territory. All Grand Nationals had the [[Lear Siegler]]-made cloth/leather interior which was only available for this year. An estimated 200 of the 1984 Grand Nationals were produced with the T-Top option which makes these the rarest of the Grand Nationals.

For 1986, a modified engine design with air-air intercooling boosted the performance even further to a specified {{convert|235|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} at 4,000 rpm and {{convert|330|lbft|0|abbr=on}} of torque at 2,400 rpm. The Grand Nationals (quantity 5,512) and T-Types (quantity 2,384) were both produced in 1986. For 1987, performance reached {{convert|245|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|355|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. Buick dropped the T-Type package for Regal for 1987 models and opted for a "T" sport package instead. There were only 7,896 turbo Regals produced in 1986. In 1987, when turbo Regals reached their peak in popularity, a total of 27,590 turbo Regals were produced through December, with those models produced between September and December of that year window stickered as "1987½ Buick Grand National" vehicles.

[[File:WO2T.jpg|thumb|1987 Regal turbo-T Limited with rare blackout trim package]]

For 1987, a lightweight WE4 (turbo T) option was offered. Only 1,547 of this variant were produced. The differences between a WE4 and the Grand National were the interior trim package, wheels, exterior badging, aluminum [[Bumper (car)|bumper]] supports, and aluminum rear [[drum brake]]s as opposed to the Grand National's [[cast iron]], making the WE4 a lighter and faster car. The rear spoiler was only available as a [[Car dealership|dealer]] installed option. Nineteen eighty-seven was the only year that the LC2 turbo option was available on any Regal, making it possible to even see a Limited with a vinyl [[Landau (automobile)|landau roof]] and a [[power bulge]] turbo hood. Turbo Regal Limiteds were one of the rarest models of turbo Regals produced second only to the GNX at 1,035 turbo Limiteds. Turbo Regal Limiteds could be ordered with many options with most having chrome external trim but for $35 could have been built with the full black-out trim option making them extremely rare. Limiteds were treated to a very luxurious interior with [[plush]] [[carpeting]] and optional bench pillow seats and a [[Gear stick|column shift]]. The 1987 model would be the end of the manufacture of the [[Rear wheel drive|RWD]] "G-Body" Regal, but [[General Motors|GM]] had to extend the build of the Grand National to meet customer demand into December.
[[File:Buick GNX (20206519195).jpg|thumb|Buick Regal GNX]]
[[File:Buick GNX (20180268696).jpg|thumb|GNX rear view]]
For the final year, 1987, Buick introduced the limited production GNX, for "Grand National Experimental", at $29,900. Made in partnership with [[Linamar|McLaren Performance Technologies]]/[[American Specialty Cars|ASC]], Buick produced only 547 GNs with the interior trim package, that were then sent off to [[McLaren Automotive|McLaren]] and upgraded into the Buick GNX. Buick underrated the GNX at {{Convert|276|hp|PS kW|0|abbr=on}} @ 4,400 rpm and a very substantial {{convert|360|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 3,000 rpm of [[Torque#Machine torque|torque]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

Changes made included a special [[Garrett AiResearch]] T-3 [[turbocharger]] with a [[ceramic]]-impeller blowing through a more efficient and significantly larger capacity [[intercooler]] with a "Cermatel (ceramic-aluminum) coated" pipe connecting the intercooler to the engine. A GNX specific E-EPROM, low-restriction exhaust with dual [[muffler]]s, reprogrammed turbo Hydramatic 200-4R transmission with a custom [[torque converter]] and transmission cooler, and unique [[Differential (mechanical device)|differential]] cover/[[Panhard]] bar included more of the performance modifications. Exterior styling changes include vents located on each front [[Fender (vehicle)|fender]], 16&amp;nbsp;inch black mesh style wheels with VR-speed rated tires, and deletion of the hood and fender emblems. The interior changes of the GNX included a serial number on the dash plaque and a revised instrument cluster providing [[Stewart-Warner]] [[Analog device|analog gauges]], including an analog turbo [[boost gauge]]. Performance was measured faster than the [[Ferrari F40]] and the [[Porsche 930]] with a [[Dragstrip|{{convert|1/4|mi|m|0}}]] time of 12.7 seconds at {{Convert|113.1|mi/h|km/h|0|abbr=on}} (0.3 and 0.8 seconds quicker, 2.9 and {{convert|13.3|mph|0|abbr=on}} faster) and a 0-{{convert|60|mph|km/h|0|abbr=on}} time of 4.6 seconds (0.4 and 0.3 seconds quicker, respectively).&lt;ref&gt;[http://imgur.com/gallery/uzXOy], ''MotorTrend'', accessed Aug 11, 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;
GNX #001 is the 1986 prototype currently owned by Buick and sometimes makes appearances at car shows around the US. The GNX used a unique [[torque arm]] that was mounted to a special, GNX only, rear differential cover, for increased [[Traction (engineering)|traction]]. The torque arm rear suspension alters the suspension geometry, making the body lift while planting the rear tires down, resulting in increased traction.

The stealthy appearance of the all-black GNX and Grand National (and the resemblance of its grill to his helmet's mouthpiece), coupled with the fact that the Grand National was initially released during the popularity of ''[[Star Wars]]'' movies, earned it the title "[[Darth Vader]]'s Car".  [[Car and Driver]] covered the GNX model's introduction with the headline "Lord Vader, your car is ready."  Due to the six cylinder engine, the Buick make, and the black paint Grand Nationals were sometimes referred to as the "Dark Side". The "Dark Side" contrasted with the more common V8 [[Ford Mustang (third generation)|Mustangs]] and Camaros that were popular at the time.

A new Regal appeared in October 1987 on the [[GM W platform]] as the first vehicle on that platform;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1987-08-30-8703050938-story.html&lt;/ref&gt; this generation ran with few changes for nine years. Though the new Regal returned to Buick's original concept in being offered only as a coupe and in being aimed once again squarely at the personal luxury buyer, it departed from tradition in being the first front-wheel drive model, and in having no serious performance option or edition. Neither a [[V8 engine|V8]] engine nor a turbocharged [[V6]] was offered; the only engine available for 1988 was the Chevrolet 2.8&amp;nbsp;L V6, producing {{convert|125|hp|abbr=on}}. From 1990, owing to the declining personal luxury car market, the Regal was again offered as a four-door [[sedan (car)|sedan]] (as were the Cutlass Supreme and Grand Prix the same year, the latter offered as a sedan for the first time).

The Regal was initially offered in base ''Custom'' and upscale ''Limited'' trim lines. For 1989, the ''[[Buick Gran Sport#Regal GS / Regal Gran Sport|Gran Sport]]'' trim line was added, featuring aluminum wheels, body side cladding and a console mounted shifter attached to the 4-speed automatic. For 1990, the Regal gained the option of the Buick 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6. The 3800 V6 was unique to the Regal, differentiating it from the mechanically similar [[Chevrolet Lumina]], [[Oldsmobile Cutlass Supreme]] and [[Pontiac Grand Prix]]. Anti-lock brakes were made standard on all but the base ''Custom'' cars from 1992, and the grille was redesigned again for 1993. Along with the new look came an electronically controlled [[automatic transmission]] and [[Buick LeSabre|LeSabre]]-like rear lights and bumper.

For 1993, a driver's side [[airbag]] was added, along with standard [[Anti-lock braking system|ABS]] on all models, standard power windows, and {{convert|20|hp|0|abbr=on}} more in the base engine due to a revised intake manifold and cylinder head. The ''Limited'' coupe was deleted; only the ''Custom'' and ''Gran Sport (GS)'' coupes remained. Dual airbags were new for 1995 along with a new interior. For 1996, the larger {{convert|3791|cc|L CID|1|abbr=on|order=flip}} V6 engine became the ''3800 Series II'' and gained {{convert|35|hp|0|abbr=on}}. {{citation needed span|Although 1996 was the last model year of this model, sales continued into 1997 as the replacement model was late (arriving in January 1997).|date=October 2018}}

[[File:Buick Regal.jpg|thumb|left|1997–2004 Buick Regal sedan]]

For the 1997 model year, the Century and Regal once again rode upon the same platform; the revised [[GM W platform|W platform]] that was shared with the [[Oldsmobile Intrigue]], the [[Pontiac Grand Prix]], the [[Chevrolet Lumina]] and [[Chevrolet Monte Carlo]].&lt;ref&gt;https://adage.com/article/news/buick-s-regal-read-costly-web-launch/263/&lt;/ref&gt; The Regal coupe was discontinued. Differences between the Regal and Century were mostly cosmetic. As the upmarket version, the Regal offered larger engines and fancier trim, and once again boasted a newer version of the 3.8&amp;nbsp;L V6. While the Century was mainly a reliable, economy-minded car based upon the W-body, the Regal was fitted with many amenities, including heated leather seats (optional on the Century), a [[Monsoon speakers|Monsoon]] 8-speaker surround sound system, dual climate control, and expansive interior space. Few changes occurred during this version's seven-year run. It offered 5-passenger seating on all trim levels like the Pontiac Grand Prix and Oldsmobile Intrigue (formerly Cutlass Supreme), unlike their predecessors that had optional 6-passenger seating and the Buick Century (formerly built on the [[GM A platform|A platform]]) which had standard 6-passenger seating.

This period held the fastest Buick since the days of the 1991-1996 Roadmaster, the Buick Regal GS. This car was now [[supercharged]] instead of turbocharged, and produced {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on}} and {{convert|280|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} of torque. When introduced in January 1997&lt;ref&gt;http://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-1996-08-11-9608110276-story.html&lt;/ref&gt;, Buick advertised the Regal as the "car for the supercharged family". Buick also released two other model types, the LSE and the GSE. The LSE stayed with the {{convert|200|hp|abbr=on}} engine with upgrades and the GSE stayed with the {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on}} supercharged engine with upgrades. Also, in 2000 Buick came out with a concept GSX that had an intercooled 3.8&amp;nbsp;L, but was supercharged rather than turbocharged. It had {{convert|295.24|hp|abbr=on}}

The North American Regal was replaced in 2005 by the [[Buick LaCrosse]], also built on the W platform. The final 2004 Buick Regal rolled off the assembly line on June 1, 2004.&lt;ref name="Wards05"&gt;{{cite book |title=Ward's Automotive Yearbook 2005 |publisher=Ward's Communications, Inc |year=2005 |page=112}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Regal LS and GS performance ===
[[File:Regal l67.jpg|thumb|left|The 3800 Series II L67 Supercharged engine in a 1998 GS]]

The Regal LS from the factory had a 1/4 mile (~400 m) elapsed time (ET) of 15.8 seconds and could do 0-60&amp;nbsp;mph in under 8 seconds. The supercharged Regal GS had a 1/4 mile ET of 14.9 seconds, and acceleration to {{convert|60|mi/h|km/h|-1|abbr=on}} took 6.7 seconds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Albee Digital Communications |url=http://www.albeedigital.com/supercoupe/articles/0-60_Quarter_Mile_Times/B_0-60times.html |title="B" 0-60 and 1/4 mile times for Factory Stock Vehicles |publisher=Albeedigital.com |date= |accessdate=2009-06-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130410163805/http://www.albeedigital.com/supercoupe/articles/0-60_Quarter_Mile_Times/B_0-60times.html |archivedate=2013-04-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Regal GS, equipped with the supercharged 3.8 liter V6 engine (L67) produced {{convert|240|hp|abbr=on}} &amp; {{convert|280|lb·ft|N.m|abbr=on}} of torque. The Regal GS's PCM has programming that activates torque management to reduce wheel spin at launch. The Regal LS was EPA rated at 19/30 MPG city/freeway while the supercharged Regal GS was EPA rated at 18/27 MPG city/freeway.

=== Regal LSX and GSX (SLP Performance) ===
SLP Performance offered dealer-installed options and dealer supplied accessories for both LS and GS models.

The three power train packages, referred to as stages, added between 15-30 HP. Performance tires, handling and braking, and lowering options were offered along with interior and exterior cosmetic options.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fabini.com/slp/slpbuickgsx.html |title=SLP Buick Regal GSX |work=Fabini's Auto Trim Co |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110710215458/http://www.fabini.com/slp/slpbuickgsx.html |archivedate=2011-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Joseph Abboud Edition===
From 2001 to 2004 Buick offered a [[Joseph Abboud]] appearance package on both the GS and LS models. This package included either a solid [[taupe]] or two-tone taupe/[[Chestnut (color)|chestnut]] leather seats, two-tone leather wrapped steering wheel, leather shifter handle and boot, 16" aluminum wheels; and Joseph Abboud signature emblems on the front doors, floor mats, front seat head rests, and taillights.

The Regal has sold well in the Chinese market as a large, relatively luxurious model, despite its high price, costing more than the North American version. The Chinese market Regal has slightly different frontal sheetmetal compared to the North American version and different engines including the 2.0&amp;nbsp;L ''[[Family II engine#L34|L34]]'', the 2.5&amp;nbsp;L ''[[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LB8|LB8]]'' V6  and the 3.0&amp;nbsp;L ''[[GM 60-Degree V6 engine#LW9|LW9]]'' V6. Gearbox choices were a 4 speed automatic for V6 models while four cylinder variants are paired with a 5 speed manual gearbox. V6 models had a set of black dashboard gauges while the four cylinder models had white dashboard gauges.  These models also had slightly different names: the entry-level model was the ''New Century'', with more upscale models carrying the ''GL'' and ''GLX'' names. Later, ''G'' and ''GS'' models were added. Production for this generation ended in November 2008 in China being replaced the Opel Insignia based Regal.

GM revealed the fifth generation Regal to North American dealers on October 14, 2009, and introduced the Regal to the public in November, 2009 at the [[LA Auto Show]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://archives.media.gm.com/archive/documents/domain_2/docId_57405_pr.html |title=Regal Named as Next Buick Sedan |date=2010-10-04 |publisher=General Motors Company |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z4e8SLa1?url=http://archives.media.gm.com/archive/documents/domain_2/docId_57405_pr.html |archivedate=2011-05-30 |accessdate=2011-05-30 |quote=...more than 1,000 dealers this week will be the first to learn the name of Buick’s next mid-size sport sedan will be the Buick Regal. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sales of the Regal began in February 2010. In North America, the Regal is positioned below the larger, more expensive [[Buick LaCrosse|LaCrosse]] and above the [[Buick Verano|Verano]] compact sedan which debuted late in calendar year 2011.

=== Production ===
[[File:Buick Regal - China.jpg|thumb|left|Chinese variant of the Regal]]

Production of the [[Shanghai GM]] variant of the Regal began in November 2008 and ended in July 2017.

North American production at [[General Motors of Canada]]'s [[Oshawa, Ontario]], assembly plant was confirmed on November 25, 2009, and production began at [[Oshawa Car Assembly]] in February 2011.&lt;ref name="mediaGM_2009-11-25"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mediaGM_2009-11-25-brand"/&gt; The initial production for the North American market was done together with its Opel twin the [[Opel Insignia]] in the [[Adam Opel AG]]'s [[Rüsselsheim]], Germany assembly plant from 1 March 2010 to 25 March 2011 (33,669 cars in 2010 and 12,637 in 2011).&lt;ref name="Opel_FactFig2011"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Opel_Plant_display"&gt;Production period according to a Foto on display at the Opel plant as seen on September 22, 2012, during the Open House on occasion of the 150-year Opel jubilee&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Trim Levels ===

==== {{anchor|CXL and CXL Turbo}} CXL ====
The Regal debuted in North America with a single engine, the 2.4L DOHC I4 engine and was rated at {{Convert|182|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|172|lbft|Nm|0}} of torque. The 2.4L engine is mated to a GM [[Hydramatic|Hydra-Matic]] 6T45 six-speed

The 2011 Regal produced in North America was offered in one trim level, called CXL, and was offered with two engine choices and seven option packages. Buick had planned to offer a lower-level trim called CX with cloth seats and a higher level trim called CXS, but those trim levels have not yet been offered.&lt;ref name="mt_2011-09_p3"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/112_0911_2011_buick_regal/future_plans.html |title=2011 Buick Regal |first=Todd |last=Lassa |date=November 2009 |work=motortrend.com |publisher=MotorTrend Magazine, Source Interlink Media |page=3 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5z4YVbINn?url=http://www.motortrend.com/roadtests/sedans/112_0911_2011_buick_regal/future_plans.html |archivedate=2011-05-30 |accessdate=2011-05-30 |quote=...Buick will add base, cloth-seat CX and high-zoot CXS trim levels. |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== GS ====
[[File:2011 Buick Verano (5490346021).jpg|thumb|left|2011 Buick Regal GS]]
At the 2010 [[North American International Auto Show]] in Detroit, GM showed a concept GS version of the Regal based on the Opel Insignia [[Opel Performance Center|OPC]] and the Vauxhall Insignia VXR. The concept featured a 2.0L, {{convert|270|hp|kW|abbr=on}}, {{convert|295|lbft|abbr=on}} high-output DOHC I4 turbocharged Ecotec engine, a 6-speed manual transmission and all-wheel drive.

The production GS leaves most of the concept specifications intact, but is front-wheel drive. The GS features Buick's Interactive Drive Control System with GS mode, a choice of an FGP Germany F40-6 six-speed manual or Aisin AF-40 (G2) six-speed automatic transmission, high performance brakes with Brembo front calipers and high performance strut (HiPerStrut) front suspension. 19&amp;nbsp;inch wheels will be standard and 20&amp;nbsp;inch forged aluminum wheels will be available. The GS is expected to accelerate from zero to 60 miles per hour in under seven seconds. The production version is  equipped with GS-only high-output version of the Ecotec 2.0L turbo engine with {{Convert|270|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|295|lbft|abbr=on}} of torque. The GM LHU engine used in the GS trim makes 135&amp;nbsp;hp per liter - Buick’s highest specific output ever.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Harman |first=Dan |title=Buick Regal |date=2014-02-05 |url=http://www.mojomotors.com/review/buick-regal/ |publisher=Mojo Motors |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6NA6CL8No?url=http://www.mojomotors.com/review/buick-regal/ |archivedate=2014-02-05 |accessdate=2014-02-05 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The GS went on sale in fall 2011 as a 2012 model.&lt;ref name="gm_pr_gs"&gt;{{cite press release|title=Buick Regal GS Production Model Takes Sports Sedan Performance To A New Level For Buick|date=2010-11-04|publisher=General Motors Company|url=http://media.gm.com/content/media/us/en/news/news_detail.brand_gm.html/content/Pages/news/us/en/2010/Nov/1104_gm_regal_gs|quote=Body style/driveline: four-door, five-passenger, front-engine transaxle.

==== eAssist ====
[[File:2012 Buick Regal eAssist WAS 2012 0830.JPG|thumb|2012 Buick Regal with optional [[BAS Hybrid#Generation II BAS (eAssist)|eAssist]] hybrid system]]

=== 2014 Update ===
[[File:2014 Regal.JPG|thumb|2014 Buick Regal eAssist]]
GM revealed an updated 2014 Regal at the 2013 [[New York Auto Show]]. Changes include a revised interior and exterior, a boost in performance for the CXL Turbo up to 258&amp;nbsp;hp (192&amp;nbsp;kW) and 295&amp;nbsp;lb·ft (400 N·m) of torque, and an available all-wheel drive option offered for the 2.0L engine/6-speed automatic transmission equipped vehicles. Changes for the GS include revised interior and exterior, a drop in power to match that of the CXL Turbo, and available an all-wheel drive option offered for the 2.0L / six-speed automatic transmission equipped vehicles. The six-speed manual transmission is still offered, but only in the front-wheel drive variant. Buick's [[Buick#VentiPorts|VentiPorts]] have reappeared starting with 2014 models, a styling feature unique to Buick that dates back to 1949.

Several new safety features were added for the 2014 year, which include forward collision warning, lane-departure warning, blind-spot monitoring, rear cross-traffic alert, and a following-distance indicator. The foregoing are all part of a Driver Confidence package, while collision preparation, which pre-loads the brake system ahead of an imminent collision, and adaptive cruise control are available separately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Lamm|first=John|title=2014 Buick Regal / Regal GS|url=http://www.caranddriver.com/news/2014-buick-regal-photos-and-info-news|work=Car and Driver|accessdate=3 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On April 4, 2017, an all-new sixth generation Buick Regal was introduced at GM's Design Dome in [[Warren, Michigan]] as a 2018 model in both [[Hatchback|liftback]] and station wagon versions. Buick Regal began sales in China on July 21, 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://media.gm.com/media/cn/en/buick/vehicles/All-New-Buick-Regal/2017.html "All-New Buick Regal"], ''Buick News China'', Retrieved on 16 August 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Similar to the previous generation, it is related to the [[Opel Insignia|Opel and Vauxhall Insignia]] sold in Europe and [[Holden Commodore (ZB)|Holden ZB Commodore]] in Australia, and like the previous generation, the vehicles were developed and are produced in Germany.

===Regal Sportback===
[[File:Buick Regal 2.0T IMG 20180417 111121.jpg|thumb|left|Rear view]]
The fastback version of the Regal, now branded as Regal Sportback, is the replacement for the Regal sedan. While the roofline is similar to that of its predecessor, the new liftback configuration provides added utility. It has grown larger in size, and is around 300 to 500 pounds lighter than the previous Regal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2017 Buick Regal Will Be Lighter, Longer Than Current Model|url=http://gmauthority.com/blog/2015/07/2017-buick-regal-will-be-lighter-longer-than-current-model/|last=Singer|first=Drew|website=GM Authority|date=July 30, 2016|accessdate=August 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It carries two versions of the ''[[GM Ecotec engine#LTG|LTG]]'' 2.0 L [[Turbocharged]] [[inline-4]] engine. [[Front-wheel drive]] models produce {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} @ 5400 rpm and {{convert|260|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 2000 rpm, while the [[all-wheel drive]] model produces {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} @ 5500 and {{convert|295|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} @ 3000 rpm, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=2018 Buick Regal spy shots|url=http://www.motorauthority.com/news/1102584_2018-buick-regal-spy-shots|last=Vijayenthiran|first=Viknesh|website=Motor Authority|date=February 27, 2016|accessdate=August 6, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Regal TourX===
[[File:2018 Buick Regal TourX Preferred AWD, rear right.jpg|thumb|left|2018 Buick Regal TourX]]
The station wagon variant, named Regal TourX, was also introduced and went on sale at the same time as the hatchback, marking the first time since the demise of the [[Buick Roadmaster|Roadmaster]] in 1996 that Buick had a station wagon in its lineup. The TourX competes against the [[Volvo V60 Cross Country]], [[Audi A4 Allroad]], [[Subaru Outback]], and [[BMW 3 Series (F30)|BMW 3 Series wagon]], and offers up to 73.5 cubic feet of storage space behind the front seats, but only comes in all-wheel drive, along with a ''[[GM Ecotec engine#LTG|LTG]]'' turbocharged 2.0-liter four-cylinder producing an estimated {{convert|250|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|295|lbft|Nm|0|abbr=on}} mated with an eight-speed automatic transmission.&lt;ref name="wagon" /&gt; The TourX is not available in Canada.

===GS===
[[File:Buick Regal II GS 001.jpg|thumb|left|Buick Regal GS front]]
[[File:Buick Regal II GS 002.jpg|thumb|left|Buick Regal GS rear]]
The 2018 GS is the performance version of sixth generation Regal. This generation of GS sports a 3.6 liter [[GM High Feature engine|LGX]] V6 engine producing 310&amp;nbsp;hp, signals return of V6 usage in a mid-size Buick after a hiatus of 13 years. This V6 engine makes GS the most powerful production Buick, (along with the [[Buick LaCrosse|third generation LaCrosse]]).

A '''clothing swap''' is a type of [[swapmeet]] wherein participants exchange their valued but no longer used [[clothing]] for clothing they will use. Clothing swaps are considered not only a good way to refill one's wardrobe, but also are considered an act of environmentalism.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.onegreenplanet.org/lifestyle/how-clothing-swaps-could-help-save-the-world/&lt;/ref&gt; It is also used to get rid of and obtain specialist clothing. Cloth swap can be specialized - they can cater for example for clothes swaps only for high end brands.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.stylewe.com/category/sweater-dresses-59_230&lt;/ref&gt;

== Description ==

The notion of swapping is not a new concept; however, many groups and organizations exist that hold clothing swaps, in a variety of sizes, to raise money and clothes for charitable donations.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/2014/sep/15/how-to-set-up-clothes-swap-in-your-area&lt;/ref&gt;

Clothes swaps originated in San Francisco California with events hosted by Suzanne Agasi in the late nineties.&lt;ref&gt;http://business.time.com/2009/09/22/qa-with-clothing-swap-founder-suzanne-agasi/&lt;/ref&gt;

Online clothes swapping has also become popular, with websites offering an environmentally friendly and frugal alternative to shopping or second-hand shops.

[[Turbulent flow]]s are complex multi-scale and chaotic motions that need to be classified into more elementary components, referred to '''coherent turbulent structures'''. Such a structure must have temporal coherence, i.e. it must persist in its form for long enough periods that the methods of time-averaged statistics can be applied. Coherent structures are typically studied on very large scales, but can be broken down into more elementary structures with coherent properties of their own, such examples include [[hairpin vortices]]. Hairpins and coherent structures have been studied and noticed in data since the 1930s, and have been since cited in thousands of scientific papers and reviews.&lt;ref name = "green"&gt;#Green, Sheldon I., “Fluid Vortices: Fluid mechanics and its applications” Dordrecht: Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1995.

[[Flow visualization]] experiments, using smoke and dye as tracers, have been historically used to simulate coherent structures and verify theories, but computer models are now the dominant tools widely used in the field to verify and understand the formation, evolution, and other properties of such structures. The kinematic properties of these motions include size, scale, shape, [[vorticity]], [[Turbulence kinetic energy | energy]], and the dynamic properties govern the way coherent structures grow, evolve, and decay. Most coherent structures are studied only within the confined forms of simple wall turbulence, which approximates the coherence to be steady, fully developed, incompressible, and with a zero pressure gradient in the [[boundary layer]].  Although such approximations depart from reality, they contain sufficient parameters needed to understand turbulent coherent structures in a highly conceptual degree.&lt;ref name= "hussain"&gt;Hussain, A. K. M. F. "Coherent structures- reality and myth" Phys. Fluids 26, 2816, doi: 10.1063/1.864048. (1983) &lt;/ref&gt;

==History and Discovery== 
The presence of organized motions and structures in turbulent shear flows was apparent for a long time, and has been additionally implied by [[Mixing length model | mixing length]] hypothesis even before the concept was explicitly stated in literature. There were also early correlation data found by measuring jets and turbulent wakes, particularly by Corrsin and Roshko. Hama's hydrogen bubble technique, which used [[flow visualization]] to observe the structures, received wide spread attention and many researchers followed up including Kline. Flow visualization is a laboratory experimental technique that is used to visualize and understand the structures of turbulent [[shear flow | shear flows]].&lt;ref name = "green" /&gt;
[[File:Fog visualization.jpg|thumb|An example of a flow visualization using fog as the visual tracer]]

With a much better understanding of coherent structures, it is now possible to discover and recognize many coherent structures in previous flow-visualization pictures collected of various turbulent flows taken decades ago. Computer simulations are now being the dominant tool for understanding and visualizing coherent flow structures. The ability to compute the necessary time-dependent [[Navier–Stokes equations | Navier-Stokes equations]] produces graphic presentations at a much more sophisticated level, and can additionally be visualized at different planes and resolutions, exceeding the expected sizes and speeds previously generated in laboratory experiments. However, controlled flow visualization experiments are still necessary to direct, develop, and validate the numerical simulations now dominant in the field.&lt;ref name = "hussain" /&gt;

==Definition==
A [[Turbulence  | turbulent flow]] is a flow regime in fluid dynamics where fluid velocity varies significantly and irregularly in both position and time.&lt;ref&gt;Pope S B. Turbulent flows[J]. 2001.&lt;/ref&gt;Furthermore, a coherent structure is defined as a turbulent flow whose vorticity expression, which is usually stochastic, contains orderly components that can be described as being instantaneously coherent over the spatial extent of the flow structure. In other words, underlying the three-dimensional chaotic vorticity expressions typical of turbulent flows, there is an organized component of that vorticity which is phase-correlated over the entire space of the structure. The instantaneously space and phase correlated vorticity found within the coherent structure expressions can be defined as coherent vorticity, hence making coherent vorticity the main characteristic identifier for coherent structures. Another characteristic inherent in turbulent flows is their [[intermittency]], but intermittency is a very poor identifier of the boundaries of a coherent structure, hence it is generally accepted that the best way to characterize the boundary of a structure is by identifying and defining the boundary of the coherent vorticity.&lt;ref name = "hussain" /&gt;

By defining and identifying coherent structure in this manner, turbulent flows can be decomposed into coherent structures and incoherent structures depending on their coherence, particularly their correlations with their vorticity. Hence, similarly organized events in an ensemble average of organized events can be defined as a coherent structure, and whatever events not identified as similar or phase and space aligned in the ensemble average is an incoherent turbulent structure. 

Other attempts at defining a coherent structure can be done through examining the correlation between their momenta or pressure and their turbulent flows. However, it often leads to false indications of turbulence, since pressure and velocity fluctuations over a fluid could be well correlated in the absence of any turbulence or vorticity. Some coherent structures, such as [[Vortex ring | vortex rings]], etc. can be large-scale motions comparable to the extent of the shear flow. There are also coherent motions at much smaller scales such as hairpin vortices and typical eddies, which are typically known as coherent substructures, as in coherent structures which can be broken up into smaller more elementary substructures.

==Characteristics== 
Although a coherent structure is by definition characterized by high levels of coherent vorticity, [[Reynolds stress]], production, and heat and mass transportation, it does not necessarily require a high level of kinetic energy. In fact, one of the main roles of coherent structures is the large-scale transport of mass, heat, and momentum without requiring the high amounts of energy normally needed. Consequently, this implies that coherent structures are not the main production and cause of Reynolds stress, and incoherent turbulence can be similarly significant.&lt;ref&gt;Ganapathisubramani, B., Longmire, E. K., Marusic, I. “Characteristics of vortex packets in turbulent boundary layers” J. Fluid Mech., vol. 478, pp. 35-46 (2003). &lt;/ref&gt;

Coherent structures cannot [[Superposition principle| superimpose]], i.e. they cannot overlap and each coherent structure has its own independent domain and boundary. Since eddies coexist as spatial superpositions, a coherent structure is not an [[Eddy (fluid dynamics)|eddy]]. For example, eddies dissipate energy by obtaining energy from the mean flow at large scales, and eventually dissipating it at the smallest scales. There is no such analogous exchange of energy between coherent structures, and any interaction such as tearing between coherent structures simply results in a new structure. However, two coherent structures can interact and influence each other. The mass of a structure change with time, with the typical case being that structures increase in volume via the diffusion of vorticity. 

One of the most fundamental quantities of coherent structures is characterized by coherent vorticity, &lt;math&gt; \Omega_c &lt;/math&gt;. Perhaps the next most critical measures of coherent structures are the coherent vs. incoherent Reynold's stresses, &lt;math&gt; -u_c\nu_c &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; - \langle u_r\nu_r \rangle &lt;/math&gt;. These represent the transports of momentum, and their relative strength indicates how much momentum is being transported by coherent structures as compared to incoherent structures. The next most significant measures include contoured depictions of coherent strain rate and shear production. A useful property of such contours is that they are invariant under Galilean transformations, hence the contours of coherent vorticity constitute an excellent identifier to the structure's boundaries. The contours of these properties not only locate where exactly coherent structure quantities have their peaks and saddles, but also identify where the incoherent turbulent structures are when overlaid on their directional gradients. In addition, spatial contours can be drawn describe the shape, size, and strength of the coherent structures, depicting not only the mechanics but also the dynamical evolution of coherent structures. For example, in order for a structure to be evolving, and hence dominant, its coherent vorticity, coherent Reynolds stress, and production terms should be larger than the time averaged values of the flow structures.&lt;ref name = "hussain" /&gt;

==Formation==
Coherent structures form due to some sort of instability, e.g. the [[Kelvin–Helmholtz instability]]. Identifying an instability, and hence the initial formation of a coherent structure, requires the knowledge of initial conditions of the flow structure. Hence, documentation of the initial condition is essential for capturing the evolution and interactions of coherent structures, since initial conditions are quite variable. Overlooking the initial conditions was common in early studies due to researchers overlooking their significance. Initial conditions include the mean velocity profile, thickness, shape, the probability densities of velocity and momentum, the spectrum of Reynolds stress values, etc.  These measures of initial flow conditions can be organized and grouped into three broad categories: [[Laminar flow | laminar]], highly disturbed, and fully turbulent.&lt;ref name = "hussain" /&gt;

Out of the three categories, coherent structures typically arise from instabilities in laminar or turbulent states.  After an initial triggering, their growth is determined by evolutionary changes due to non-linear interactions with other coherent structures, or their decay onto incoherent turbulent structures. Observed rapid changes lead to the belief that there must be a regenerative cycle that takes place during decay. For example, after a structure decays, the result may be that the flow is now turbulent and becomes susceptible to a new instability determined by the new flow state, leading to a new coherent structure being formed. It is also possible that structures do not decay and instead distort by splitting into substructures or interacting with other coherent structures.

==Categories of Coherent Structures==

===Lagrangian Coherent Structures===
[[File:Skeleton turbulence.png|400px|right|thumb|Attracting (red) and repelling (blue)  LCSs extracted from a two-dimensional turbulence experiment (Image: Manikandan Mathur)&lt;ref name=Mathur2007&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Mathur | first1 = M. | last2 = Haller | first2 = G. | last3 = Peacock | first3 = T. | last4 = Ruppert-Felsot | first4 = J. | last5 = Swinney | first5 = H. | title = Uncovering the Lagrangian Skeleton of Turbulence | doi = 10.1103/PhysRevLett.98.144502 | journal = Physical Review Letters | volume = 98 | issue = 14 | pages = 144502 | year = 2007 | pmid =  17501277| pmc = |bibcode = 2007PhRvL..98n4502M }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

[[Lagrangian coherent structures]] (LCSs) are influential material surfaces that create clearly recognizable patterns in passive tracer distributions advected by an unsteady flow. LCSs can be classified as hyperbolic (locally maximally attracting or repelling material surfaces), elliptic (material vortex boundaries), and parabolic (material jet cores). These surfaces are generalizations of classical invariant manifolds, known in [[dynamical systems]] theory, to finite-time unsteady flow data. This Lagrangian perspective on coherence is concerned with structures formed  by fluid elements, as opposed to the [[Euler equations (fluid dynamics) | Eulerian]] notion of coherence, which considers features in the instantaneous velocity field of the fluid.  Various mathematical techniques have been developed to identify [[Lagrangian coherent structure | LCSs]] in two- and three-dimenisonal data sets, and have been applied to laboratory experiments, numerical simulations and geophysical observations. &lt;ref&gt;Peacock, T., Haller, G. "Lagrangian Coherent structures: the hidden skeleton of fluid flows" Physics Today, 41 (2013). http://georgehaller.com/reprints/PhysToday.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Haller2015&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1146/annurev-fluid-010313-141322| title = Lagrangian Coherent Structures| journal = Annual Review of Fluid Mechanics| volume = 47| pages = 137| year = 2015| last1 = Haller | first1 = G. | bibcode = 2015AnRFM..47..137H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hairpin Vortices===
Hairpin vortices are found on top of turbulent bulges of the [http://www.cfd-online.com/Wiki/Introduction_to_turbulence/Wall_bounded_turbulent_flows turbulent wall], wrapping around the turbulent wall in hairpin shaped loops, where the name originates. The hairpin-shaped vortices are believed to be one of the most important and elementary sustained flow patterns in turbulent boundary layers. Hairpins are perhaps the simplest structures, and models that represent large scale turbulent boundary layers are often constructed by breaking down individual hairpin vortices, which could explain most of the features of wall turbulence. Although hairpin vortices form the basis of simple conceptual models of flow near a wall, actual turbulent flows may contain a hierarchy of competing vortices, each with their own degree of asymmetry and disturbances.&lt;ref&gt;Adrian, R. J. “Hairpin vortex organization in wall turbulence” Phys. Fluids 19, 041301 (2007). &lt;/ref&gt;

Hairpin vortices resemble the horseshoe vortex, which exists because of perturbations of small upward motion due to differences in upward flowing velocities depending on the distance from the wall. These form multiple packets of hairpin vortices, where hairpin packets of different sizes could generate new vortices to add to the packet. Specifically, close to the surface, the tail ends of hairpin vortices could gradually converge resulting in provoked eruptions, producing new hairpin vortices. Hence, such eruptions are a regenerative process, in which they act to create vortices near the surface and eject them out onto the outer regions of the turbulent wall. Based on the eruptive properties, such flows can be inferred to be very efficient at heat transfer because of mixing. Specifically, eruptions carry hot fluids up while cooler flows are brought downwards during the converging of tails of the hairpin vortices before erupting.&lt;ref&gt;Haidari, A. H., Smith, C. R. “The generation and regeneration of single hairpin vortices” J. Fluid Mech., vol. 277, pp. 135-162. (1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

It is believed that production and contributions to &lt;math&gt; -\overline{u'v'} &lt;/math&gt;, the Reynolds stress, occur during strong interactions between the inner and outer walls of hairpins. During the production of this Reynold's stress term, the contributions come in sharp intermittent time segments when eruptions bring new vortices outward. 

Formation of hairpin vortices has been observed in experiments and numerical simulations of single hairpins, however observational evidence for them in nature is still limited. Theodorsen has been producing sketches that indicate the presence of hairpin vortices in his flow visualization experiments. These smaller elementary structures can be seen overlaying the main vortex in the sketch to the right (image of sketch to Theodorsen's steam experiment that exposes the presence of structures). The sketch was well advanced for the time, but with the advent of computers came better depictions. Robinson in 1952 isolated two types of flow structures that he named the "horseshoe", or arch, vortex and the "quasi-streamwise" vortex (classic figure shown to the right).&lt;ref name="green"/&gt; 
 
[[File:CreativeLicensedAfterRobinson.png|thumb|Describes the two main flow structures that Robinson found through Direct Numerical Simulations&lt;ref name="green"/&gt;]]

Since the mass usage of computers, [[Direct numerical simulation| direct numerical simulations]] or DNS have been used widely, producing vast data sets describing the complex evolution of flow. DNS indicates many complicated 3-dimensional vortices are embedded in regions of high shear near the surface. Researchers look around this region of high shear for indications of individual vortex structures based on accepted definitions, like coherent vortices. Historically, a vortex has been thought of as a region in the flow where a group of vortex lines come together hence indicating the presence of a vortex core, with groups of instantaneous circular paths about the core. In 1991, Robinson defined a vortex structure to be a core consisting of convected low pressure regions, where instantaneous streamlines can form circles or spiral shapes relative to the plane normal to the vortex core plane. Although it is not possible to track the evolution of hairpins over long periods, it is possible to identify and trace their evolution over short time periods. Some of the key notable features of hairpin vortices are how they interact with the background shear flow, other vortices, and how they interact with the flow near the surface.&lt;ref name="green"/&gt;

[[File:Deer stone, Mongolia.jpg|thumb|Deer stone, Mongolia.]]
'''Deer stones''' (also known as '''reindeer stones''') are ancient [[megalith]]s carved with symbols found largely in [[Siberia]] and [[Mongolia]]. The name comes from their carved depictions of flying deer. There are many theories to the reasons behind their existence and the people who made them.

==Construction==
Deer stones are usually constructed from [[granite]] or [[greenstone (archaeology)|greenstone]], depending on which is the most abundant in the surrounding area.&lt;ref name=soulflight&gt;{{cite web|last=Vitebsky|first=Piers|title=The Reindeer People: Living with Animals and Spirits in Siberia |work=Soul Flight to the Sun|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Company|accessdate=2011-12-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; They have varying heights; most are over 3 feet tall,&lt;ref name=muse&gt;{{cite web |last=Fitzhugh |first=William |title=Project Muse |url=http://muse.jhu.edu/journals/arc/summary/v046/46.1-2.fitzhugh.html |work=Stone Shamans and Flying Deer of Northern Mongolia: Deer Goddess of Siberia or Chimera of the Steppe? |publisher=University of Wisconsin Press |accessdate=2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; but some reach a height of 15 feet. The tops of the stones can be flat, round or smashed, suggesting that perhaps the original top had been deliberately destroyed. The stones are usually oriented with the decorated face to the east.

The carvings and designs were most usually completed before the stone was erected, though some stones show signs of being carved in place.&lt;ref name=american-mongolia/&gt; The designs were pecked or ground into the stone surface. Deep-grooved cuts and right-angle surfaces indicate the presence of metal tools. Stone tools were used to smooth the harsh cuts of some designs.&lt;ref name=muse/&gt; Nearly all the stones were hand carved, but some unusual stones show signs that they could have been cut with a primitive type of mechanical drill.&lt;ref name=american-mongolia/&gt;

== Types of stones ==
V. V. Volkov, in his thirty years of research, classified three distinct types of deer stones.

===Classic Mongolian===
These stones are fairly detailed and more elegant in their depiction methods. They usually feature a belted warrior with a stylized flying [[reindeer]] on his torso.  This type of stone is most prominent in southern Siberia and northern Mongolia. This concentration suggests that these stones were the origin of the deer stone tradition, and further types both simplified and elaborated on these.&lt;ref name=complex/&gt;

===West Asian-European===
These stones feature a central region of the stone, sectioned off by two "belts", horizontal lines. There are also "earring hoops", large circles, diagonal slashes in groups of two and three known as "faces", and "necklaces", collection of stone pits resembling their namesake.

===Sayan-Altai===
The Sayan-Altai stones feature some of the West Asian-European markings, including free-floating, straight-legged animals, daggers and other tools. The appearance of deer [[Motif (visual arts)|motifs]] is markedly diminished, and those that do appear often do not emphasise the relationship between reindeer and flying. The Sayan-Altai stones can be sub-divided into two types:
* The Gorno-Altai stones have simple warrior motifs, displaying tools in the belt region of the stone. Reindeer motifs appear but are few.
* The Sayan-Tuva stones are similar to the Gorno-Altai but contain fewer images of animals. No deer motifs are present. The artistic style is much simpler, often consisting of only belts, necklaces, earrings and faces.

&lt;gallery&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;

==Imagery==
[[File:Reindeer Detailing.jpg|thumb|200px|Different applications of ornate antler detailing]]
There are many common images that appear in deer stones, as well as a multitude of ways they are presented.&lt;ref name=american-mongolia&gt;{{cite web|last=Fitzhugh|first=William|title=American-Mongolia Deer Stone Project|url=http://www.mnh.si.edu/Arctic/html/pdf/2009_mongolia_report_online_version.pdf|work=Field Report 2009|publisher=Arctic Studies Center|accessdate=2011-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Reindeer===
Reindeer feature prominently in nearly all of the deer stones.  Early stones have very simple images of reindeer, and as time progresses, the designs increase in detail.  A gap of 500 years results in the appearance of the complicated flying reindeer depiction.  Reindeer are depicted as flying through the air, rather than merely running on land.  Piers Vitebsky writes, "The reindeer is depicted with its neck outstretched and its legs flung out fore and aft, as if not merely galloping but leaping through the air."&lt;ref name=soulflight/&gt; The antlers, sometimes appearing in pairs, have become extremely ornate, utilizing vast spiral designs that can encompass the entire deer. These antlers sometimes hold a sun disc or other sun-related image.  Other artwork from the same period further emphasizes the connection between the reindeer and the sun, which is a very common association in Siberian [[shamanism]]. Tattoos on buried warriors contain deer tattoos, featuring antlers embellished with small birds' heads. This reindeer-sun-bird imagery perhaps symbolizes the shaman's spiritual transformation from the earth to the sky: the passage from earthly life to heavenly life. As these deer images also appear in warrior tattoos, it is possible that reindeer were believed to offer protection from dangerous forces.&lt;ref name=muse/&gt; Another theory is that the deer spirit served as a guide to assist the warrior soul to heaven.&lt;ref name=complex&gt;{{cite web|last=Fitzhugh|first=William|title=The Mongolian Deer Stone-Khirigsuur Complex|work=Dating and Organization of a Late Bronze Age Menagerie|accessdate=2011-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other animals===
Particularly in the Sayan-Altai stones, a multitude of other animals are present in deer stone imagery.  One can see depictions of tigers, pigs, cows, horse-like creatures, frogs and birds.&lt;ref name=american-mongolia/&gt; Unlike the reindeer, however, these animals are depicted in a more natural style. This lack of ornate detailing indicates the lack of [[supernatural]] importance of such animals, taking an obvious backseat against the reindeer.&lt;ref name=complex/&gt; The animals are often paired off with one another in confrontation, e.g. a tiger confronting a horse in a much more earthly activity.

===Weapons and tools===
[[File:Sample Stones.jpg|thumb|300px|Several sample stone differences]]
Weapons and tools can be seen throughout all the stones, though weapons make a strong appearance in the Sayan-Altai stones.&lt;ref name=american-mongolia/&gt; Bows and daggers crop up frequently, as well as typical Bronze-Age implements, such as fire-starters or chariot reins.&lt;ref name=muse/&gt; The appearance of these tools helps date the stones to the Bronze Age.

===Patterns===
[[Chevron (insignia)|Chevron]] patterns crop up occasionally, usually in the upper regions of the stone.  These patterns can be likened to military shields, suggesting the stones' connection to armed conflict.  It has also been suggested that chevron patterns could be a shamanic emblem representing the skeleton.&lt;ref name=muse/&gt;

===Human faces===
Human faces are a much rarer occurrence and are usually carved into the top of the stone.  These faces are carved with an open mouth, as though singing. This also suggests a religious/shamanistic connection of the deer stone, as vocal expression is a common and important theme in [[shamanism]].

==Geographic distribution==
Archaeologists have found over 900 deer stones in Central Asia and South Siberia.&lt;ref name=Turbat&gt;Ts. Turbat et al ''Deer Stones of the Jargalantyn Am'' 2011 {{ISBN|978-99962-845-8-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similar images are found in a wider area, as far west as [[Kuban]], [[Russia]]; the [[Southern Bug]] in the [[Ukraine]]; [[Dobruja]], [[Bulgaria]]; and the [[Elbe]], which flows through the [[Czech Republic]] and [[Germany]].&lt;ref name=Jacobson&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jacobson|first1=Esther|title=The deer goddess of ancient Siberia : a study in the ecology of belief|date=1993|publisher=Brill|location=Leiden|isbn=978-90-04-09628-8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vnlRu7CW95gC&amp;dq=Deer+Stone&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origin and purpose==
Deer stones were probably originally erected by [[Bronze Age]] nomads around 1000 BCE though further research into the [[Cimmerian]] stone stelae-[[Kurgan stelae]] should be taken into much consideration. Later cultures have often reused the stones in their own burial mounds (known as ''[[kheregsüür]]s'') and for other purposes. Modern vandals have also defaced and even looted the stones.

There are several proposed theories for the purpose of the deer stones. There are different viewpoints about the origins of deer stone art. According to H.L. Chlyenova, the artistic deer image originated from the Sak tribe and its branches (Chlyenova 1962). Volkov believes that some of the methods of crafting deer stone art are closely related to Scythians (Volkov 1967), whereas Mongolian archaeologist D. Tseveendorj regards deer stone art as having originated in Mongolia during the Bronze Age and spread thereafter to Tuva and the Baikal area (Tseveendorj 1979). D. G. Savinov (1994) and M. H. Mannai-Ool (1970) have also studied deer stone art and have reached other conclusions. The stones do not occur alone, usually with several other stone monuments, sometimes carved, sometimes not.  The soil around these gatherings often contains traces of animal remains, for example, horses. Such remains were placed underneath these auxiliary stones. Human remains, on the other hand, were not found at any of the sites, which discredits the theory that the stones could function as gravestones.&lt;ref name=muse/&gt; The markings on the stones and the presence of sacrificial remains could suggest a religious purpose, perhaps a prime location for the occurrence of shamanistic rituals.&lt;ref name=soulflight/&gt; Some stones include a circle at the top and stylised dagger and belt at the bottom, which has led some scholars, such as [[William W. Fitzhugh|William Fitzhugh]], to speculate that the stones could represent a spiritualized human body, particularly that of a prominent figure such as a warrior or leader.&lt;ref name=muse/&gt; This theory is reinforced by the fact that the stones are all very different in construction and imagery, which could be because each stone tells a unique story for the individual it represents.

==Modern studies==
In 1892, V.V. Radlov published a collection of drawings of deer stones in Mongolia. Radlov's drawings showed the highly stylized images of deer on the stones, as well as the settings in which they were placed. Radlov showed that in some instances the stones were set in patterns suggesting the walls of a grave, and in other instances, the deer stones were set in elaborate circular patterns, suggesting use in rituals of unknown significance.&lt;ref name=Jacobson/&gt;

In 1954 A.P. Okladnikov published a study of a deer stone found in 1856 by D.P. Davydov near modern [[Ulan-Ude]] now known as the Ivolga stone, displayed in the Irkutsk State Historical Museum. Okladinkov identified the deer images as reindeer, dated the stone's carving to the 6th-7th Centuries BC, and concluded from its placement and other images that it was associated with funerary rituals, and was a monument to a warrior leader of high social prominence.&lt;ref name=Jacobson/&gt;

A 1981 study by V.V. Volkov is the most extensive study of deer stones to date. It identified two cultural conditions behind the deer stones. The eastern deer stones appear to be associated with cemeteries composed of above-ground slab graves. The other cultural tradition is associated with the circular structures suggesting use as the center of rituals.&lt;ref name=Jacobson/&gt;

In 2006, the Deer Stone Project of the [[Smithsonian Institution]] and [[Mongolian Academy of Sciences]] began to record the stones digitally with [[3D scanner|3-D laser scanning]].

'''Diethylene glycol dinitrate''' is a [[nitration|nitrated]] [[alcohol]] [[ester]] produced by the action of concentrated [[nitric acid]], normally admixed with an excess of strong [[sulfuric acid]] as a dehydrating agent, upon [[diethylene glycol]].

Diethylene glycol dinitrate is a colorless, odorless, viscous, oily liquid, with [[specific gravity]] 1.4092 at 0&amp;nbsp;°C and 1.3846 at 20&amp;nbsp;°C; freezing point −11.5&amp;nbsp;°C under a standard atmosphere; the theoretical boiling point of approximately 197&amp;nbsp;°C difficult to confirm as the compound begins to decompose and spontaneously inflames at or slightly below this temperature. Partial pressure is reported as {{convert|0.007|mmHg|mPa|abbr=on}} at 22.4&amp;nbsp;°C and {{convert|760|mmHg|abbr=on}}. It is readily miscible in most non-polar solvents, [[methanol]], and cold [[acetic acid]]. Solubility in water (4.1&amp;nbsp;g/L at 24&amp;nbsp;°C) and [[ethanol]] is very low. While chemically similar to a number of powerful [[high explosive]]s, pure diethylene glycol dinitrate is extremely hard to initiate and will not propagate a [[detonation wave]]. It inflames only with difficulty (requiring localized heating to decomposition point) unless first atomized, and burns placidly even in quantity.

Mixed with [[nitrocellulose]] and [[extruded]] under pressure, diethylene glycol dinitrate forms a tough [[colloid]] whose characteristics (good [[specific impulse]], moderate burn rate and temperature, great resistance to accidental ignition and casual handling) make it well suited as a [[smokeless powder]] for artillery and a [[solid propellant]] for rocketry. It was widely used in this capacity during World War II (e.g., by the Kriegsmarine&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navweaps.com/index_tech/tech-100.htm&lt;/ref&gt;). It also found use as a "productive" desensitizer (one that contributes to the overall power of the explosion rather than having a neutral or negative effect) in [[nitroglycerine]] and [[nitroglycol]]-based explosives such as [[dynamite]] and [[blasting gelatin]]. It is also used as [[plasticizer]] for [[energetic material]]s.

If ingested, like nitroglycerine, it produces rapid [[vasodilation]] through the release of [[nitrogen monoxide]], NO.  Popularly termed [[nitric oxide]], NO is a physiological signaling molecule that relaxes smooth muscle.  Consequently, diethylene glycol dinitrate has occasionally been used medically to relieve [[Angina pectoris|angina]], substernal [[chest pain]] associated with impaired [[cardiac]] circulation.   The rationale is that the concurrent headache it induces is somewhat less severe than other [[nitro compound]]s.

At present, interest in the chemical seems to be mostly historical: more potent [[perchlorate]]–metal mixtures have long since supplanted it as a solid propellant; safer explosives have replaced nitroglycerine, true dynamites (the term is often used generically, even by experienced field technicians, to refer to almost any explosive supplied in small, discrete packages) retaining only a few specialist uses. The medical application was never widespread, the standard nitroglycerine being faster acting and almost literally dirt cheap; oral nitrates in any case being only [[palliative]], not an effective treatment.

[[Triethylene glycol dinitrate]], diethylene glycol dinitrate, and [[trimethylolethane trinitrate]] are being considered as replacements for nitroglycerin in propellants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stormingmedia.us/cat/sub/subcat20-57.html |title=Guns and Ordnance: Ammunition and Explosives - Storming Media |publisher=Stormingmedia.us |date= |accessdate=2011-12-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ecology''' is a broad biological science and can be divided into many sub-disciplines using various criteria. Many of these fields overlap, complement and inform each other, and few of these disciplines exist in isolation.  For example, the [[population ecology]] of an organism is a consequence of its [[behavioral ecology]] and intimately tied to its [[community ecology]]. Methods from [[molecular ecology]] might inform the study of the population, and all kinds of data are modeled and analyzed using [[quantitative ecology]] techniques.  

When discussing the study of a single species, a distinction is usually made between its ''biology'' and its ''ecology''.  For example, "[[polar bear]] biology" might include the study of the polar bear's [[physiology]], [[morphology (biology)|morphology]], [[pathology]] and [[ontogeny]],  whereas "polar bear ecology" would include a study of its prey species, its population and [[metapopulation]] status, distribution, dependence on environmental conditions, etc.  In that sense, there can be as many subdisciplines of ecology as there are species to study. 

==Other criteria==
[[Ecology]] can also be classified on the basis of:

* the primary kinds of organism under study, e.g. [[animal ecology]], [[plant ecology]], [[insect ecology]];
* the [[biomes]] principally studied, e.g. [[forest ecology]], [[grassland ecology]], [[desert ecology]], [[benthic ecology]], [[marine ecology]], [[urban ecology]];
* the geographic or climatic area, e.g. [[arctic ecology]], [[tropical ecology]]
* the spatial scale under consideration, e.g. [[macroecology]], [[landscape ecology]];
* the philosophical approach, e.g. [[systems ecology]] which adopts a [[holistic]] approach;
* the methods used, e.g. [[molecular ecology]].

==List of subdisciplines==
Specialized branches of ecology include, among others:

* [[applied ecology]], the practice of employing ecological principles and understanding to solve real world problems (includes [[agroecology]] and [[conservation biology]]);
* [[biogeochemistry]], effect of biota on global chemistry, and the cycles of matter and energy that transport the Earth's chemical components in time and space.
* [[biogeography]], the study of the geographic distributions of species ;
* [[chemical ecology]], which deals with the ecological role of biological chemicals used in a wide range of areas including defense against predators and attraction of mates;
* [[community ecology]], which focus on understanding how different species interact with each other;
* [[conservation biology|conservation ecology]], which studies how to reduce the risk of species extinction;
* [[ecological succession]], which focuses on understanding directed vegetation change;
* [[ecophysiology]] which studies the interaction of physiological traits with the abiotic environment;  
* [[ecotoxicology]], which looks at the ecological role of toxic chemicals (often [[pollutant]]s, but also naturally occurring compounds);
* [[evolutionary ecology]] or [[ecoevolution]] which looks at evolutionary changes in the context of the populations and communities in which the organisms exist;
* [[fire ecology]], which looks at the role of fire in the environment of plants and animals and its effect on ecological communities;
* [[functional ecology]], the study of the roles, or functions, that certain species (or groups thereof) play in an ecosystem;
* [[global ecology]], which examines ecological phenomena at the largest possible scale, addressing [[macroecology|macroecological]] questions;
* [[landscape ecology]], which studies the interactions between discrete elements of a [[landscape]]; 
* [[macroecology]], the study of large scale phenomena;
* [[marine ecology]], and [[aquatic ecology]], where the dominant environmental milieu is water;
* [[microbial ecology]], the ecology of micro-organisms;
* [[microecology]], the study of small scale phenomena;
* [[paleoecology]], which seeks to understand the relationships between species in fossil assemblages;
* [[population ecology]], which tries to gain understanding and predicting spatio-temporal dynamics of a single species. Includes Metapopulation ecology and Demography;
* [[quantitative ecology]], the development of mathematical and statistical tools to interpret and analyze ecological data;
* [[restoration ecology]], which attempts to understand the ecological basis needed to restore impaired or damaged ecosystems;
* [[soil ecology]], the ecology of the pedosphere;
* [[theoretical ecology]], the development of ecological theory, usually with mathematical, statistical and/or computer modeling tools;
* [[urban ecology]], the study of ecosystems in urban areas.

Ecology also plays important roles in many inter-disciplinary fields:

* [[ecological design]] and [[ecological engineering]].
* [[ecological economics]].
* [[festive ecology]].
* [[human ecology]] and [[ecological anthropology]].
* [[Social ecology (academic field)|social ecology]], [[ecological health]] and [[environmental psychology]].

Ecology has also inspired (and lent its name to) other non-biological disciplines such as

* [[industrial ecology]].
* [[media ecology]].
* [[software ecology]] and [[information ecology]].

Finally, ecology is used to describe several philosophies or ideologies, such as 

* [[deep ecology]]
* [[Social ecology (theory)|social ecology]]

'''Emissions Reduction Currency Systems (ERCS)''' are schemes that provide a positive economic and or social reward for reductions in [[greenhouse gas]] emissions, either through distribution or redistribution of national currency or through the publishing of [[coupons]], [[loyalty programs|reward points]], [[local currency]], or [[complementary currency]].

==Compared to other emissions reductions instruments==
Emissions reduction currency is different from an [[emissions credit]]. The value of an emissions credit is determined by a national cap in emissions and the degree to which the credit confers a right to pollute.  The ultimate value of an emissions credit is realised when it is surrendered to avoid punitive fines for emitting.

Emissions reduction currency is also different from a voluntary [[carbon offset]] where a payment is made, typically to fund alternative energy or reforestation, the emissions reduction or sequestration resulting from which is used to reduce or cancel the payers responsibility for emissions produced by themselves.  The value of an offset is in its being held by the purchaser and applies only for the period and purpose against which the offset applies.

An emissions reduction currency, by contrast, is purely an incentive for behaviour change by individuals or groups.  As such the currency creates an additional economic benefit for emissions reductions separate from the cost imposed by national emissions caps or the voluntary cost assumed by the purchaser of a voluntary offset.

Emissions reduction currencies are not exchangeable within national [[cap and trade]] systems and as such do not confer any right to pollute.

While no emissions reduction currency system has achieved the scale of emissions crediting systems, there are a number of small scale schemes in operation or being set up.  In addition there are a number of approaches that are currently hypothetical being promoted by a number of organisations, academic institutions and [[think tank]]s.

Emissions reduction currency systems conceptually are inclusive of [[Personal carbon trading|carbon currency]] systems but also include schemes that reduce emissions in incidental ways such as through waste reduction and community education.

==History==
The idea of a global wealth system based on alternative energy production was first suggested by [[Buckminster Fuller]] in his 1969 book ''[[Operating Manual for Spaceship Earth]]''.  This idea was piloted by [[Garry Davis]] who distributed these "kilowatt dollars" at the 1992 [[Earth Summit]] held in [[Rio de Janeiro]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hz7y60h_cME YouTube interview with Garry Davis by Kiwah.org]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://garrydavis.blogspot.com/2008/09/isn-it-time-for-world-money.html Garry Davis Blog 'Isn't it time for world money']&lt;/ref&gt; Edgar Kempers and Rob Van Hilton launched the Kiwah (kilowatt hour) currency at the Copenhagen Climate Summit in 2009.

==Categories of Emissions Reduction Currency Systems==

Emission reduction currency systems can be designated as belonging to one or more of five categories:

===Carbon title schemes===
Introduction of sustainable land management practices in [[tropical rainforest]] and other high carbon environments can lead to [[wikt:abatement|abatement]] of emissions from land clearing that might have otherwise occurred or from additional [[CO2 sequestration]].

Land purchased and managed for these purposes can be used to create an independently tradeable carbon right,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.austlii.edu.au/au/legis/wa/consol_act/cra2003143/ Western Australian Carbon Rights Act of 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; which may or may not be recognised within an emissions credit scheme. For example, aboveground biomass resulting from land use changes can currently be converted to recognised [[emissions credits]] under the [[Kyoto Protocol]] [[Clean Development Mechanism]] (CDM).  Increases in [[soil carbon]] for reasons other than [[reforestation]] either through changes to land management practices or through the burial of [[biochar]] are currently not included in [[emissions credit]] systems such as the CDM.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science?_ob=ArticleURL&amp;_udi=B6VP6-4X24C72-2&amp;_user=10&amp;_rdoc=1&amp;_fmt=&amp;_orig=search&amp;_sort=d&amp;_docanchor=&amp;view=c&amp;_searchStrId=1025310422&amp;_rerunOrigin=google&amp;_acct=C000050221&amp;_version=1&amp;_urlVersion=0&amp;_userid=10&amp;md5=e396df780eaece96355b377a3c5ca906 Biochar—One way forward for soil carbon in offset mechanisms in Africa?, Environmental Science &amp; Policy]&lt;/ref&gt;

These certificates of legal title can be traded as a form of currency independently of their use as an offset, yielding additional economic benefits.
This use is suggested by The Carbon Currency Foundation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carboncurrencyfoundation.org/ Official Carbon Currency Foundation Website]&lt;/ref&gt;

Another emissions reduction currency system proposed on this basis is the ECO, a project of The Next Nature Lab which is an initiative of [[Eindhoven University of Technology]] in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.eco-currency.net/ The official ECO project website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nextnature.net/2010/05/eco-currency-%E2%80%93-a-proposal-to-balance-economical-and-environmental-value/ The Next Nature Lab website]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promotional discount schemes===
An emissions reduction currency system based on promotional discount is one where participants are rewarded for reducing their emissions by gaining points which can be redeemed for discounts from businesses advertising in the system.

[[RecycleBank]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.recyclebank.com/ Official Recyclebank Website]&lt;/ref&gt; is one such scheme where participants weigh recycled materials in specially designed disposal bins that identify themselves to scales embedded in garbage collection vehicles.  Recyclebank is also funded by municipal governments that purchase and operate the required equipment, allowing RecycleBank to operate as a private for profit company. Another similar scheme is Greenopolis&lt;ref&gt;[http://greenopolis.com/ Official Greenopolis website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.goodcleantech.com/2008/01/greenopolis_green_social_netwo.php GoodCleanTech.Com review of Greenopolis]&lt;/ref&gt; that works through [[social media]] websites such as Facebook.

EarthAid&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthaid.net/ Official EarthAid Website]&lt;/ref&gt; uses specialised software that publishes utility bills from companies in an online format that participants can share with family and friends.  Reduced energy consumption earns [[loyalty programs|reward points]] that can be redeemed for prizes at businesses in the EarthAid rewards network.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/04/23/AR2009042304522.html The Washington Post – Eureka! Get Paid For Paring Down Home Energy Costs]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Allocation schemes===

An emissions currency reduction system based on allocation is one where all individual participants are awarded an equal allotment of emissions currency.  Participants then trade goods and services with one another to obtain enough of the currency to cover their actual emissions.
The objective of an allocation scheme is to obtain social parity between participants with regards to emissions reductions.

Technically an [[emissions credit|emissions crediting scheme]],an allocation scheme is classed as an emissions reduction currency system because the trading of the currency between individuals as parity is sought can create a secondary market of trading where the currency can act as a medium of exchange, and this trading creates an additional positive economic value associated with emissions reductions.

The Global Resource Bank&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grb.net/ Global Resource Bank Official Website]&lt;/ref&gt; is one organisation advocating such a global allocation scheme.

===Emissions rationing schemes===

Otherwise known as [[personal carbon trading]], an emissions reduction currency system based on [[rationing]] presumes a standard ration of emissions allowable for an average citizen that incrementally decreases over time.

Participants using less than the rationed amount receive a currency that can be traded with those emitting more than the allowed amount.
All participants pledge to in total remain below the average with a net positive value in the scheme.

Carbon Rationing Action Groups&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbonrationing.org.uk/ Official Carbon rationing Action Groups Website]&lt;/ref&gt; (CRAG), started in the United Kingdom, has a global network of groups. CRAG participants use a standard average for the country as a basis for the rationed amount. Participants emitting at above rationed levels must pay those below it in national currency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theecologist.org/take_action/campaigns/269560/a_rational_approach_to_carbon.html The Ecologist – A rational approach to carbon]&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Norfolk Island]], Australia is in the process of implementing an island-wide voluntary personal carbon trading scheme designed by [[Southern Cross University]] Professor Garry Egger,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smh.com.au/environment/energy-smart/islanders-lead-world-on-personal-carbon-test-scheme-20101026-172ea.html Sydney Morning Herald – Islanders lead world on personal carbon test scheme]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Community based currency schemes===

A community based emissions reduction currency scheme is a C4 type local currency in which [[local currency]] issues are backed by the emissions reductions of the schemes members.  The local currency, when accepted for trade by other members or local businesses, thereby rewards participants for their efforts at global warming prevention.  These currencies may have various degrees of convertibility into carbon saved, [[renewable energy]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.smallisbeautiful.org/publications/essays_swann/place_of_local_currency.html The Place for Local Currency in a World Economy: Toward an Economy of Permanence, Robert Swann, The E.F. Schumacher Society 1981]&lt;/ref&gt; or national currency.

The Edogawatt is a form of emissions reduction currency used in [[Edogawa, Tokyo]] that is an initiative of the local [[Jōdo Shinshū]] Jukou-in temple.  In this scheme, the temple and devotees purchase solar panels and sell the excess power to the [[Tokyo Electric Power Company]].  The temple then takes the difference between the price paid by the Tokyo Electric Power Company and the price paid for natural energy in Germany and sells Green Power Certificates as a fund raiser for the temple.  Purchasers of the Green Power Certificates are given 30 Edogawatt bills per certificate. "These are currently being used among people ... as a certificate of debt or obligation in exchange for baby-sitting, carrying loads, translating and other small jobs. They have provided an incentive for creation of a mutual aid society within the community and we would like to make them a tool for deepening interpersonal relationships and trust."&lt;ref&gt;[http://juko-in.or.jp/Eactivity.htm Official website of the Juko-in Temple]&lt;/ref&gt;

http://www.qoin.org/what-we-do/past-projects/kyoto4all/ Kyoto4All was a 2006 report written by Peter van Luttervelt, David Beatty and Edgar Kampers for the Dutch Ministry of Environment (then named VROM). The study described a series of monetary models to connect citizens-consumers to the climate change targets of the post-Kyoto period.

The Maia Maia Emissions Reduction Currency System,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.maiamaia.org/ Official Maia Maia Project website]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.complementarycurrency.org/ccDatabase/les_public.html International database of complementary currencies]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://blog.green.tv/blog/2009/10/carbon-credit-schemes-dont-fall-from-the-sky-you-know/ Green.tv interview with founder of the Maia Maia Project]&lt;/ref&gt; is a scheme developed in Western Australia. The system currency is known as a "boya", named after the indigenous [[Nyungar]] people's word for rock trading tokens used by them.  Each boya is based on 10 kilograms of carbon dioxide equivalent global warming prevention which is equates to a $100 tonne CO2-e [[Carbon_tax#Social_cost_of_carbon|Social Cost of Carbon]], which approximates a middle estimate from peer reviewed studies. The first issue of boya occurred on 30 January 2011 in [[Fremantle, Western Australia]] at an event hosted by the International [[Permaculture]] Service and the [[Gaia Foundation]] of Western Australia.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ccmag.net/maia-maia-boya-emissions-nelson Community Currency Magazine April 2011 edition]&lt;/ref&gt; Other issuers of Boya include the [[University of Vermont]] and in Australia, primary schools, non-profit organisations, and a neighbourhood association.

The Liquidity Network,&lt;ref&gt;[http://theliquiditynetwork.org/ Liquidity Network Home Page]&lt;/ref&gt; an initiative of the [[Foundation for the Economics of Sustainability]] is proposing to introduce a community run emissions reduction currency in the County of Kilkenny in Ireland.  The proposal is currently before council for consideration.

===Monetizing Schemes===
A monetised emissions reduction currency is backed by the financial value of emissions credits or certified under a regulatory scheme or other financial products derived from them.  These credits can be converted into [[fiat currency]] through transferring ownership of the underlying assets such as selling the [[emission credits]] into [[cap and trade]] markets.

The [[Ven (currency)|Ven]] is a [[virtual economy|virtual currency]] issued by the [[Hub Culture]] social media network.  The value of Ven is determined on the financial markets from a basket of currencies and commodities.  The Ven may be categorised as an emissions reduction currency because carbon futures are included as one of the commodities used to value the currency.

Carbon Manna&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carbonmanna.org/ Official Carbon Manna home page]&lt;/ref&gt; is a proposed scheme that will use proceeds from pre-selling credits from bundled emissions reduction projects to reimburse users directly or to enroll them in the successful mobile phone currency [[M-PESA]] being used in developing countries to reduce monetary transaction costs and hedge against currency fluctuations.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.huffingtonpost.com/richard-seireeni/transforming-the-african_b_199242.html Richard Seireeni ''Transforming the African Brand Through Sustainability'' –  Huffington Post]&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1993">The '''empty weight''' of an [[aircraft]] is based on its weight without any [[payload]] (cargo, passengers, usable fuel, etc.).&lt;ref&gt;https://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aircraft/media/FAA-H-8083-1A.pdf Aircraft Weight and Balance Handbook&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aircraft/airplane_handbook/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-07-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110630014450/http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aircraft/airplane_handbook/ |archivedate=2011-06-30 |df= }} Airplane Flying Handbook (12-11)&lt;/ref&gt;  Many different empty weight definitions exist, here are some of the more common ones used.

== GAMA Standardization ==

In 1975 the [[General Aviation Manufacturers Association]] (GAMA) standardized the definition of empty weight terms for [[Aircraft flight manual|Pilot Operating Handbooks]] as follows:

{|
|-
| ||Standard Empty Weight
|-
| +||Optional Equipment
|-
| colspan=2 |
----
|-
| ||Basic Empty Weight
|}

Standard Empty Weight includes the following:
* Empty weight of the airplane
* Full [[Hydraulic fluid|Hydraulic Fluid]]
* [[Usable fuel|Unusable Fuel]]
* Full Oil

Optional Equipment includes the following:
* All equipment installed beyond standard

== Non GAMA Usage ==

Previously the following were commonly used to define empty weights:

{|
|-
| ||Empty Weight
|-
| +||Unusable Fuel
|-
| Colspan=2 |
----
|-
| ||Standard Empty Weight
|}
{| 
|-
| ||Standard Empty Weight
|-
| +||Optional Equipment
|-
| colspan=2 |
----
|-
| ||Licensed Empty Weight
|}

In this definition Empty Weight includes the following:
* Empty weight of the airplane
* Undrainable Oil
* Full Hydraulic Fluid

Note that weight of oil must be added to Licensed Empty Weight for it to be equivalent to Basic Empty Weight

The '''environmental impact of the [[energy industry]]''' is diverse. [[Energy]] has been harnessed by human beings for millennia. Initially it was with the use of [[fire]] for light, heat, cooking and for safety, and its use can be traced back at least 1.9 million years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1163886 |pmid=19390038 |title=Fire in the Earth System |journal=Science |volume=324 |issue=5926 |pages=481–4 |year=2009 |last1=Bowman |first1=D.

In recent years there has been a trend towards the increased [[renewable energy commercialization|commercialization of various renewable energy sources]].

Rapidly advancing technologies can potentially achieve a transition of energy generation, water and waste management, and food production towards better environmental and energy usage practices using methods of [[systems ecology]] and [[industrial ecology]].&lt;ref&gt;Kay, J.

===Climate change===
[[File:Instrumental Temperature Record (NASA).svg|right|thumb|Global mean surface temperature anomaly relative to 1961–1990.]] 
{{main|Attribution of recent climate change}}

The [[Scientific opinion on climate change|scientific consensus on global warming and climate change]] is that it is caused by [[anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions]], the majority of which comes from burning [[fossil fuel]]s with [[deforestation]] and some agricultural practices being also major contributors.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.epa.gov/climatechange/basics/&lt;/ref&gt; A 2013 study showed that two thirds of the industrial greenhouse gas emissions are due to the fossil-fuel (and cement) production of just ninety companies around the world (between 1751 and 2010, with half emitted since 1986).&lt;ref&gt;Douglas Starr, [http://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/08/just-90-companies-are-blame-most-climate-change-carbon-accountant-says "The carbon accountant. Richard Heede pins much of the responsibility for climate change on just 90 companies. Others say that's a cop-out"], ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'', volume 353, issue 6302, 26 August 2016, pages 858-861.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Richard Heede, [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10584-013-0986-y "Tracing anthropogenic carbon dioxide and [[methane emissions]] to fossil fuel and cement producers, 1854–2010"], ''Climatic Change'', January 2014, volume 122, issue 1, pages 229–241 ([http://download.springer.com/static/pdf/371/art%253A10.1007%252Fs10584-013-0986-y.pdf?originUrl=http%3A%2F%2Flink.springer.com%2Farticle%2F10.1007%2Fs10584-013-0986-y&amp;token2=exp=1480862039~acl=%2Fstatic%2Fpdf%2F371%2Fart%25253A10.1007%25252Fs10584-013-0986-y.pdf%3ForiginUrl%3Dhttp%253A%252F%252Flink.springer.com%252Farticle%252F10.1007%252Fs10584-013-0986-y*~hmac=38abf81d7d261975e4357370f3826c88c8afbd448ba0a4a6ee15b507bee6af11 PDF]).&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there is a highly publicized [[Climate change denial|denial of climate change]], the vast majority of scientists working in [[climatology]] accept that it is due to human activity. The [[IPCC]] report ''Climate Change 2007: Climate Change Impacts, Adaptation and Vulnerability'' predicts that climate change will cause shortages of food and water and increased risk of flooding that will affect billions of people, particularly those living in poverty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/science/nature/6532323.stm 
|title= Billions face climate change risk
|publisher=BBC NEWS Science/Nature 
|date=2007-04-06
|accessdate=2011-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One measurement of greenhouse gas related and other [[Externality]] comparisons between energy sources can be found in the ExternE project by the [[Paul Scherrer Institut]] and the [[University of Stuttgart]] which was funded by the [[European Commission]].&lt;ref name="ExternEFTR"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.externe.info/expoltec.pdf |title=Final Technical Report, Version 2 |author=Rabl A. |date=August 2005 |work=Externalities of Energy: Extension of Accounting Framework and Policy Applications |publisher=European Commission |display-authors=etal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120307120342/http://www.externe.info/expoltec.pdf |archivedate=7 March 2012 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to that study,&lt;ref name="ExternEGraphs"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gabe.web.psi.ch/projects/externe_pol/index.html |title=External costs of electricity systems (graph format) |year=2005 |work=ExternE-Pol |publisher=Technology Assessment / GaBE ([[Paul Scherrer Institut]]) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131101201452/http://gabe.web.psi.ch/projects/externe_pol/index.html |archivedate=1 November 2013 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[hydroelectric]] electricity produces the lowest CO2 emissions, [[wind energy|wind]] produces the second-lowest, [[Nuclear power|nuclear energy]] produces the third-lowest and [[solar energy|solar]] [[photovoltaic]] produces the fourth-lowest.&lt;ref name="ExternEGraphs"/&gt;

Similarly, the same research study (ExternE, Externalities of Energy), undertaken from 1995 to 2005 found that the cost of producing electricity from coal or oil would double over its present value, and the cost of electricity production from gas would increase by 30% if external costs such as damage to the environment and to human health, from the [[Atmospheric particulate matter|airborne particulate matter]], [[nitrogen oxides]], [[chromium VI]] and [[arsenic]] emissions produced by these sources, were taken into account. It was estimated in the study that these external, downstream, fossil fuel costs amount up to 1%-2% of the [[Economy of the European Union|EU’s entire Gross Domestic Product (GDP)]], and this was before the external cost of global warming from these sources was even included.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ier.uni-stuttgart.de/forschung/projektwebsites/newext/externen.pdf New research reveals the real costs of electricity in Europe]&lt;/ref&gt; The study also found that the environmental and health costs of nuclear power, per unit of energy delivered, was €0.0019/kWh, which was found to be lower than that of many [[renewable]] sources including that caused by [[biomass]] and photovoltaic [[solar panels]], and was thirty times lower than coal at €0.06/kWh, or 6 cents/kWh, with the energy sources of the lowest external environmental and health costs associated with it being [[wind power]] at €0.0009/kWh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.externe.info/externe_2006/exterpols.html ExternE-Pol, External costs of current and advanced electricity systems, associated with emissions from the operation of power plants and with the rest of the energy chain, final technical report.] See figure 9, 9b and figure 11&lt;/ref&gt;

===Biofuel use===
{{further|Environmental impact of biofuels}}
[[Biofuel]] is defined as solid, liquid or gaseous [[fuel]] obtained from relatively recently lifeless or living biological material and is different from [[fossil fuel]]s, which are derived from long-dead biological material. Various [[plant]]s and plant-derived materials are used for biofuel manufacturing.

====Bio-diesel====
{{main|Environmental effects of biodiesel}}
{{see also|Indirect land use change impacts of biofuels|Sustainable biofuel}}
High use of bio-diesel leads to land use changes including [[deforestation]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.cifor.org/publications/pdf_files/WPapers/WP68Pacheco.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

====Firewood====

Unsustainable [[firewood]] harvesting can lead to [[Biodiversity loss|loss of biodiversity]] and [[erosion]] due to loss of forest cover. An example of this is a 40-year study done by the [[University of Leeds]] of African forests, which account for a third of the world's total [[tropical forest]] which demonstrates that [[Africa]] is a significant [[carbon sink]]. A [[climate change]] expert, Lee White states that "To get an idea of the value of the sink, the removal of nearly 5 billion tonnes of [[carbon dioxide]] from the atmosphere by intact tropical forests is at issue.

According to the [[U.N.]] the African continent is losing forest twice as fast as the rest of the world. "Once upon a time, Africa boasted seven million square kilometers of forest but a third of that has been lost, most of it to [[charcoal]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/8272603.stm 
|title= Africa's burning charcoal problem 
|publisher=BBC NEWS Africa 
|date= 2009-09-25
|first= Anthea |last=Rowan |accessdate=2011-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fossil fuel use===
[[Image:Global Carbon Emissions.svg|thumb|right|Global fossil [[carbon]] emission by fuel type, 1800-2007 AD.]]
The three [[fossil fuel]] types are [[coal]], [[petroleum]] and [[natural gas]]. It was estimated by the [[Energy Information Administration]] that in 2006 primary sources of energy consisted of petroleum 36.8%, coal 26.6%, natural gas 22.9%, amounting to an 86% share for fossil fuels in primary energy production in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eia.doe.gov/iea/overview.html|title=International Energy Annual 2006|accessdate=2009-02-08|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090205035658/http://www.eia.doe.gov/iea/overview.html|archivedate=5 February 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the burning of fossil fuels produced around 32 billion [[tonnes]] (32 [[gigatonne]]s) of [[carbon dioxide]] and additional [[air pollution]]. This caused negative [[externality|externalities]] of $4.9 trillion due to global warming and health problems (&gt; 150 $/ton carbon dioxide).&lt;ref&gt;[[Ottmar Edenhofer]], ''King Coal and the queen of subsidies''. In: ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' 349, Issue 6254, (2015), 1286, {{DOI|10.1126/science.aad0674}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Carbon dioxide is one of the [[greenhouse gas]]es that enhances [[radiative forcing]] and contributes to [[global warming]], causing the [[Instrumental temperature record|average surface temperature]] of the Earth to rise in response, which [[Scientific opinion on climate change|climate scientists]] agree will cause major adverse [[Effects of global warming|effects]].

====Coal====
{{Main|Environmental impact of the coal industry}}

The environmental impact of [[coal mining]] and burning is diverse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ucsusa.org/clean_energy/coalvswind/c02c.html 
|title=Environmental impacts of coal power: air pollution |year=2009  |publisher=Union of Concerned Scientists  |accessdate=2011-04-22 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Legislation passed by the U.S. Congress in 1990 required the [[United States Environmental Protection Agency]] (EPA) to issue a plan to alleviate toxic pollution from coal-fired power plants.  After delay and litigation, the EPA now has a court-imposed deadline of March 16, 2011, to issue its report.

==== Petroleum ====
{{Main|Environmental impact of the petroleum industry}}
[[File:Oil-spill.jpg|right|thumb|A beach after an [[oil spill]].]]

The environmental impact of [[petroleum]] is often negative because it is [[toxic]] to almost all forms of life. The possibility of [[climate change]] exists. Petroleum, commonly referred to as oil, is closely linked to virtually all aspects of present society, especially for transportation and heating for both homes and for commercial activities.

====Gas====
[[Natural gas]] is often described as the cleanest fossil fuel, producing less carbon dioxide per joule delivered than either coal or oil.,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.naturalgas.org/environment/naturalgas.asp#greenhouse/ Natural Gas and the Environment] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090503132200/http://www.naturalgas.org/environment/naturalgas.asp |date=3 May 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and far fewer pollutants than other fossil fuels.  However, in absolute terms it does contribute substantially to global carbon emissions, and this contribution is projected to grow. According to the [[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]],&lt;ref&gt;[[IPCC Fourth Assessment Report]] (Working Group III Report, Chapter 4)&lt;/ref&gt; in 2004 natural gas produced about 5,300 Mt/yr of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; emissions, while coal and oil produced 10,600 and 10,200 respectively (Figure 4.4); but by 2030, according to an updated version of the [[Special Report on Emissions Scenarios#B2|SRES B2]] emissions scenario, natural gas would be the source of 11,000 Mt/yr, with coal and oil now 8,400 and 17,200 respectively.&lt;!--   dead link &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ipcc.ch/ipccreports/ar4-wg3.htm IPCC]&lt;/ref&gt;  --&gt; ([[List of countries by carbon dioxide emissions|Total global emissions]] for 2004 were estimated at over 27,200 Mt.)

In addition, natural gas itself is a greenhouse gas far more potent than carbon dioxide when released into the atmosphere but is released in smaller amounts.

===Electricity generation===
{{main|Environmental impact of electricity generation}}
The environmental impact of electricity generation is significant because modern society uses large amounts of electrical power.  This power is normally [[electricity generation|generated]] at [[power plant]]s that convert some other kind of energy into electrical power.  Each such system has advantages and disadvantages, but many of them pose environmental concerns.

{{main|Environmental impact of reservoirs}}
The environmental impact of reservoirs is coming under ever increasing scrutiny as the world demand for water and energy increases and the number and size of reservoirs increases. [[Dam]]s and the [[reservoir]]s can be used to supply [[drinking water]], generate [[hydroelectric]] power, increasing the water supply for [[irrigation]], provide recreational opportunities and for flood control. However, adverse environmental and sociological impacts have also been identified during and after many reservoir constructions. Whether reservoir projects are ultimately beneficial or detrimental&amp;mdash;to both the environment and surrounding human populations&amp;mdash; has been debated since the 1960s  and probably long before that. In 1960 the construction of [[Llyn Celyn]] and the flooding of [[Capel Celyn]] provoked political uproar which continues to this day. More recently, the construction of [[Three Gorges Dam]] and other similar projects throughout [[Asia]], [[Africa]] and [[Latin America]] have generated considerable environmental and political debate.

===Nuclear power===
{{main|Environmental impact of nuclear power}}
[[File:Nuclear power environmenal collage.jpg|thumb|right|Nuclear power activities involving the environment; mining, enrichment, generation and geological disposal.]]
The environmental impact of [[nuclear power]] results from the [[nuclear fuel cycle]], operation, and the effects of [[nuclear accidents]].

The routine health risks and [[greenhouse gas emission]]s from nuclear fission power are smaller than those associated with coal, oil and gas. However, there is a "catastrophic risk" potential if containment fails,&lt;ref name=ipfm2010/&gt; which in nuclear reactors can be brought about by over-heated fuels melting and releasing large quantities of fission products into the environment. The most long-lived radioactive wastes, including spent nuclear fuel, must be contained and isolated from humans and the environment for hundreds of thousands of years. The public is sensitive to these risks and there has been considerable [[Anti-nuclear movement|public opposition to nuclear power]]. Despite this potential for disaster, normal fossil fuel related pollution is still considerably more harmful than any previous nuclear disaster.

The 1979 [[Three Mile Island accident]] and 1986 [[Chernobyl disaster]], along with high construction costs, ended the rapid growth of global nuclear power capacity.&lt;ref name=ipfm2010&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fissilematerials.com/ipfm/site_down/rr09.pdf |title=The Uncertain Future of Nuclear Energy |author=International Panel on Fissile Materials |date = September 2010|work=Research Report 9 |page=1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A further disastrous release of radioactive materials followed the 2011 Japanese tsunami which damaged the [[Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant]], resulting in [[Fukushima I nuclear accidents|hydrogen gas explosions and partial meltdowns]] classified as a [[International Nuclear Event Scale|Level 7]] event. The large-scale release of radioactivity resulted in people being evacuated from a 20&amp;nbsp;km exclusion zone set up around the power plant, similar to the 30&amp;nbsp;km radius [[Chernobyl Exclusion Zone]] still in effect.

===Wind power===
{{main|Environmental impact of wind power}}
[[File:Wb deichh drei kuhs.jpg|thumb|right|[[Livestock]] grazing near a wind turbine.]]

The '''environmental impact of wind power''' when compared to the environmental impacts of fossil fuels, is relatively minor. According to the [[IPCC]], in assessments of the [[Life-cycle greenhouse-gas emissions of energy sources|life-cycle global warming potential of energy sources]], wind turbines have a [[median]] value of between 12 and 11 ([[gram|g]]{{CO2}}[[Carbon dioxide equivalent|eq]]/[[kWh]]) depending, respectively, on if offshore or onshore turbines are being assessed.&lt;ref name="IPCC 2014 Annex III"&gt;{{cite web |title=IPCC Working Group III – Mitigation of Climate Change, Annex II I: Technology - specific cost and performance parameters |url=http://report.mitigation2014.org/drafts/final-draft-postplenary/ipcc_wg3_ar5_final-draft_postplenary_annex-iii.pdf |publisher=IPCC |accessdate=1 August 2014 |page=10 |year=2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140616215117/http://report.mitigation2014.org/drafts/final-draft-postplenary/ipcc_wg3_ar5_final-draft_postplenary_annex-iii.pdf |archivedate=16 June 2014 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=IPCC Working Group III – Mitigation of Climate Change, Annex II Metrics and Methodology. pg 37 to 40,41 |url=http://report.mitigation2014.org/drafts/final-draft-postplenary/ipcc_wg3_ar5_final-draft_postplenary_annex-ii.pdf |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140929140555/http://report.mitigation2014.org/drafts/final-draft-postplenary/ipcc_wg3_ar5_final-draft_postplenary_annex-ii.pdf |archivedate=29 September 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Compared with other [[low carbon power]] sources, wind turbines have some of the lowest [[global warming potential]] per unit of electrical energy generated.&lt;ref&gt;Begoña Guezuraga, Rudolf Zauner, Werner Pölz, ''Life cycle assessment of two different 2 MW class wind turbines'', [[Renewable Energy (journal)|Renewable Energy]] 37 (2012) 37-44, p 37. {{DOI|10.1016/j.renene.2011.05.008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While a wind farm may cover a large area of land, many land uses such as agriculture are compatible with it, as only small areas of turbine foundations and infrastructure are made unavailable for use.&lt;ref name=mar&gt;[http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf  Why Australia needs wind power] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070101080556/http://www.sustainabilitycentre.com.au/WindPowersStrength.pdf |date=1 January 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="British Wind Energy Association"&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.bwea.com/ref/faq.html| title=Wind energy Frequently Asked Questions| publisher=British Wind Energy Association| accessdate=21 April 2006| deadurl=yes| archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060419225935/http://www.bwea.com/ref/faq.html| archivedate=19 April 2006| df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are reports of bird and bat mortality at wind turbines as there are around other artificial structures. The scale of the ecological impact may or may not be significant, depending on specific circumstances. Prevention and mitigation of wildlife fatalities, and protection of [[peat bogs]], affect the siting and operation of wind turbines.

There are anecdotal reports of negative health effects from noise on people who live very close to wind turbines.&lt;ref name="Gohlke"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1289/ehp.11602 |pmid=18560493 |pmc=2430245 |title=Health, Economy, and Environment: Sustainable Energy Choices for a Nation |journal=Environmental Health Perspectives |volume=116 |issue=6 |pages=A236–7 |year=2008 |last1=Gohlke |first1=Julia M |last2=Hrynkow |first2=Sharon H |last3=Portier |first3=Christopher J }}&lt;/ref&gt; Peer-reviewed research has generally not supported these claims.&lt;ref name="Toronto Star-2009.12.15"&gt;{{cite news

Aesthetic aspects of wind turbines and resulting changes of the visual landscape are  significant.&lt;ref name=TK&gt;Thomas Kirchhoff (2014): [http://www.naturphilosophie.org/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/Kirchhoff_2014_Energiewende-und-Landschaftsaesthetik.pdf Energiewende und Landschaftsästhetik.

==Mitigation==

===Energy conservation===
{{main|Energy conservation}}
Energy conservation refers to efforts made to reduce energy consumption. Energy conservation can be achieved through increased [[efficient energy use]], in conjunction with decreased [[World energy resources and consumption|energy consumption]] and/or reduced consumption from conventional energy sources.

Energy conservation can result in increased [[financial capital]], [[Natural environment|environmental]] quality, [[national security]], [[personal security]], and [[Thermal comfort|human comfort]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2011}}  Individuals and organizations that are direct [[consumer]]s of energy choose to conserve energy to reduce energy costs and promote [[economic security]]. Industrial and commercial users can increase energy use efficiency to maximize [[Profit (economics)|profit]].

The increase of global energy use can also be slowed by tackling [[human population growth]], by using non-coercive measures such as better provision of [[family planning]] services and by empowering (educating) women in developing countries.

===Energy policy===
{{main|Energy policy}}
Energy policy is the manner in which a given entity (often governmental) has decided to address issues of [[energy development]] including [[energy production]], [[Resource distribution|distribution]] and [[Consumption (economics)|consumption]].  The attributes of energy policy may include [[legislation]], international treaties, incentives to investment, guidelines for [[energy conservation]], [[tax]]ation and other public policy techniques.

==Brazil==
The Brazilian version of the Idea was launched in late 2005. The engines available are the new 1.4-litre 8-valve {{Convert|86|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} Fire engine (the same as in the [[Fiat Punto|Grande Punto]]) and the latest version of the [[General Motors|GM]]-sourced Powertrain 1.8-litre 8-valve {{Convert|114|hp|kW|0|abbr=on}} engine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fiatcars.org/fiat-idea |title=Fiat Idea |publisher=Fiat Cars |date= |accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both have [[flexible fuel]] technology, which lets the driver use either [[gasoline]] or [[ethanol]].

This version has a longer wheelbase and height compared to the European version.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.automobile-catalog.com/auta_details1.php |title=1991 BMW 850i Automatic |publisher=Automobile-catalog.com |date= |accessdate=22 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The interior design is taken from the [[Fiat Palio|Fiat Palio Mk. III]], and adapted to the South American market{{Citation needed|date=September 2008}}. It also has a panoramic glass roof as an option, known as the SkyDome.

The Idea is exported in two different trim levels (the ELX with the 1.4-litre engine and the HLX with the 1.8 engine) and it has four [[airbag]]s, [[anti-lock braking system]] with [[Electronic brakeforce distribution|EBD]]; parking, rain and lights sensor, security laminated glass, the SkyDome, 15" alloys, [[Bluetooth]] phone system, and leather seats among other features.

Over 170,000 Ideas have been sold in Brazil since its launch (2005).
In 2010 the Idea received another facelift with new front, rear and door handles.

===Idea Adventure===
[[File:2258369992 4bc01db3f0 o.jpg|right|thumb|Idea Adventure]]
The '''Idea Adventure''' is a [[mini SUV|mini crossover]] version that was launched in September 2006 in [[São Paulo]], Brazil. It has a revised suspension, tires are Pirelli Scorpion 205/70 R15, a protective body kit, specially designed 15" alloys, interior mods like the white instruments, the specially designed seats with leather, and a standard safety equipment which features double front and side airbags, ABS brakes with EBD. In 2009 the whole '''Adventure''' line (Idea, [[Fiat Doblò|Doblò]], [[Fiat Strada|Strada]] and [[Fiat Palio Weekend|Palio Weekend]]) was equipped with a [[locking differential]]. The line was rebadged as '''Adventure Locker'''.

The '''Fleischmann–Pons experiment''' was an investigation conducted in the 1980s by [[Martin Fleischmann]] of the [[University of Southampton]] and [[Stanley Pons]] of the [[University of Utah]] into whether [[electrolysis]] of [[heavy water]] on the surface of a [[palladium]] (Pd) electrode produces physical effects that defy [[chemistry|chemical]] explanation.{{sfn|ps=|Voss|1999}} Of particular interest was evidence of "excess" (i.e. non-chemical) [[heat]] extracted from the [[deuterium]] fraction of common [[surface water]] which, if true, could have delivered the largest economic shock to the global [[energy industry]] since the [[Pennsylvania oil rush]].

On March 23, 1989, Fleischmann (then one of the world's leading electrochemists) and Pons reported their work via a press release&lt;ref name=Utahpress1989&gt;
{{cite journal |ref=harv |mode=cs2 |last=University of Utah|title='Simple experiment' results in sustained n-fusion at room temperature for first time|url=http://newenergytimes.com/v2/reports/UniversityOfUtahPressRelease.shtml|accessdate=28 July 2011
}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the University of Utah (who asserted ownership of the technology)&lt;ref name=Utahpress1989/&gt; claiming that the table-top apparatus had produced anomalous heat (understood as "excess" heat) of a magnitude they asserted would defy explanation except in terms of nuclear processes, which later came to be referred to as "[[cold fusion]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |mode=cs2

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the results from [[calorimetry]], they further reported measuring small amounts of nuclear reaction byproducts, including [[neutrons]] and [[tritium]].&lt;ref name=FP1989&gt;{{harvnb|Fleischmann|Pons|1989|p=301}} ("It is inconceivable that this [amount of heat] could be due to anything but nuclear processes...

Many scientists tried to replicate the experiment with the few details available. Hopes faded due to the large number of negative replications, the withdrawal of many reported positive replications, the discovery of flaws and sources of experimental error in the original experiment, and finally the discovery that Fleischmann and Pons had not actually detected nuclear reaction byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Browne|1989}}, {{harvnb|Close|1992}}, {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993}}, {{harvnb|Taubes|1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; By late 1989, most scientists considered cold fusion claims dead.{{sfn|ps=|Browne|1989}}&lt;ref name="most scientists"&gt;{{harvnb|Taubes|1993|pp=262, 265–266, 269–270, 273, 285, 289, 293, 313, 326, 340–344, 364, 366, 404–406}}, {{harvnb|Goodstein|1994}}, {{harvnb|Van Noorden|2007}}, {{harvnb|Kean|2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[Martin Fleischmann]] of the [[University of Southampton]] and Stanley Pons of the [[University of Utah]] hypothesized that the high compression ratio and mobility of [[deuterium]] that could be achieved within palladium metal using electrolysis might result in nuclear fusion.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|1989|p=301}} To investigate, they conducted electrolysis experiments using a palladium cathode and heavy water within a calorimeter, an insulated vessel designed to measure process heat. Current was applied continuously for many weeks, with the [[heavy water]] being renewed at intervals.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|1989|p=301}} Some deuterium was thought to be accumulating within the cathode, but most was allowed to bubble out of the cell, joining oxygen produced at the anode.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|Anderson|Li|1990}} For most of the time, the power input to the cell was equal to the calculated power leaving the cell within measurement accuracy, and the cell temperature was stable at around 30&amp;nbsp;°C. But then, at some point (in some of the experiments), the temperature rose suddenly to about 50&amp;nbsp;°C without changes in the input power. These high temperature phases would last for two days or more and would repeat several times in any given experiment once they had occurred. The calculated power leaving the cell was significantly higher than the input power during these high temperature phases. Eventually the high temperature phases would no longer occur within a particular cell.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|Anderson|Li|1990}}

In 1988, Fleischmann and Pons applied to the [[United States Department of Energy]] for funding towards a larger series of experiments. Up to this point they had been funding their experiments using a small device built with $100,000 [[Out-of-pocket expenses|out-of-pocket]].{{sfn|ps=|Crease|Samios|1989|p=V1}} The grant proposal was turned over for [[peer review]], and one of the reviewers was [[Steven E. Jones|Steven Jones]] of [[Brigham Young University]].{{sfn|ps=|Crease|Samios|1989|p=V1}} Jones had worked for some time on [[muon-catalyzed fusion]], a known method of inducing nuclear fusion without high temperatures, and had written an article on the topic entitled "Cold nuclear fusion" that had been published in ''[[Scientific American]]'' in July 1987. Fleischmann and Pons and co-workers met with Jones and co-workers on occasion in [[Utah]] to share research and techniques. During this time, Fleischmann and Pons described their experiments as generating considerable "excess energy", in the sense that it could not be explained by [[chemical reaction]]s alone.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|Anderson|Li|1990}} They felt that such a discovery could bear significant commercial value and would be entitled to [[patent|patent protection]]. Jones, however, was measuring neutron flux, which was not of commercial interest.{{sfn|ps=|Crease|Samios|1989|p=V1}}{{clarify|date=November 2015}} To avoid future problems, the teams appeared to agree to simultaneously publish their results, though their accounts of their 6 March meeting differ.{{sfn|ps=|Lewenstein|1994|pp=8–9}}

==Announcement==
In mid-March 1989, both research teams were ready to publish their findings, and Fleischmann and Jones had agreed to meet at an airport on 24 March to send their papers to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' via [[FedEx]].{{sfn|ps=|Lewenstein|1994|pp=8–9}} Fleischmann and Pons, however, pressured by the University of Utah, which wanted to establish priority on the discovery,&lt;ref name="utah patent"&gt;{{harvnb|Shamoo|Resnik|2003|p=86}}, {{harvnb|Simon|2002|pp=28–36}}&lt;/ref&gt; broke their apparent agreement, submitting their paper to the ''Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry'' on 11 March, and disclosing their work via a press release&lt;ref name=Utahpress1989/&gt; and press conference on 23 March.{{sfn|ps=|Crease|Samios|1989|p=V1}} Jones, upset, faxed in his paper to ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'' after the press conference.{{sfn|ps=|Lewenstein|1994|pp=8–9}}

Fleischmann and Pons' announcement drew wide media attention.&lt;ref name=Brooks&gt;For example, in 1989, the ''Economist'' editorialized that the cold fusion "affair" was "exactly what science should be about." {{cite journal |ref=harv |mode=cs2 |first=JK|last=Footlick|title=Truth and Consequences: how colleges and universities meet public crises|isbn=978-0-89774-970-1|page=51|location=Phoenix|publisher=Oryx Press|year=1997}} as cited in {{cite journal |ref=harv |mode=cs2 |first=M|last=Brooks|title=[[13 Things That Don't Make Sense]]|isbn=978-1-60751-666-8|page=67|location=New York|publisher=[[Doubleday (publisher)|Doubleday]]|year=2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; But the 1986 discovery of [[high-temperature superconductivity]] had made the scientific community more open to revelations of unexpected scientific results that could have huge economic repercussions and that could be replicated reliably even if they had not been predicted by established theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simon|2002|pp=57–60}}, {{harvnb|Goodstein|1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; And many scientists were also reminded of the [[Mössbauer effect]], a process involving [[Isomeric transition|nuclear transitions]] in a solid. Its discovery 30 years earlier had also been unexpected, though it was quickly replicated and explained within the existing physics framework.{{sfn|ps=|Goodstein|1994}}

The announcement of a new purported clean source of energy came at a crucial time: adults still remembered the [[1973 oil crisis]] and the problems caused by oil dependence, anthropogenic [[global warming]] was starting to become notorious, the [[anti-nuclear movement]] was labeling nuclear power plants as dangerous and getting them closed, people had in mind the consequences of [[strip mining]], [[acid rain]], the [[greenhouse effect]] and the [[Exxon Valdez oil spill]], which happened the day after the announcement.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Petit|2009}}, {{harvnb|Park|2000|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the press conference, [[Chase N. Peterson]], then the president of the University of Utah, Fleischmann and Pons, backed by the solidity of their scientific credentials, repeatedly assured the journalists that cold fusion would solve environmental problems and would provide a limitless inexhaustible source of clean energy using only seawater as fuel.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taubes|1993|pp=xviii–xx}}, {{harvnb|Park|2000|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; They said the results had been confirmed dozens of times and they had no doubts about them.{{sfn|ps=|Taubes|1993|pp=xx–xxi}} In the accompanying press release Fleischmann was quoted saying: "What we have done is to open the door of a new research area, our indications are that the discovery will be relatively easy to make into a usable technology for generating heat and power, but continued work is needed, first, to further understand the science and secondly, to determine its value to energy economics."&lt;ref name="Utahpress1989"/&gt;

==Response and fallout==
Although the experimental protocol had not been published, physicists in several countries attempted, and failed, to replicate the excess heat phenomenon. The first paper submitted to ''Nature'' reproducing excess heat, although it passed peer-review, was rejected because most similar experiments were negative and there were no theories that could explain a positive result;&lt;ref group="notes" name="Beaudette rejection"&gt;On 26 January 1990, journal ''Nature'' rejected Oriani's paper, citing the lack of nuclear ash and the general difficulty that others had in replication.{{harvnb|Beaudette|2002|p=183}} It was later published in ''Fusion Technology''.{{harvnb|Oriani|Nelson|Lee|Broadhurst|1990|pp=652–662}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|ps=|Beaudette|2002|pp=183, 313}} this paper was later accepted for publication by the journal ''Fusion Technology''.

In April 1989, Fleischmann and Pons published a "preliminary note" in the ''[[Journal of Electroanalytical Chemistry]]''.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|1989|p=301}} This paper notably showed a gamma peak without its corresponding [[Compton edge]], which indicated they had made a mistake in claiming evidence of fusion byproducts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tate|1989|p=1}}, {{harvnb|Platt|1998}}, {{harvnb|Close|1992|pp=277–288, 362–363}}, {{harvnb|Taubes|1993|pp=141, 147, 167–171, 243–248, 271–272, 288}}, {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|pp=63, 138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fleischmann and Pons replied to this critique,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref= harv |mode= cs2 |title= Measurement of gamma-rays from cold fusion (letter by Fleischmann et al. and reply by Petrasso et al.) |journal= Nature |volume= 339 |date= 29 June 1989 |doi= 10.1038/339667a0 |url= http://www.psfc.mit.edu/icf/Home%20Page/Papers/Petrasso_Nature.pdf |bibcode= 1989Natur.339..667F |page= 667 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20130720173049/http://www.psfc.mit.edu/icf/Home%20Page/Papers/Petrasso_Nature.pdf |archivedate= 20 July 2013 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt; but the only thing left clear was that no gamma ray had been registered and that Fleischmann refused to recognize any mistakes in the data.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taubes|1993|pp=310–314}}, {{harvnb|Close|1992|pp=286–287}}, {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|pp=63, 138–139}}&lt;/ref&gt; A much longer paper published a year later went into details of calorimetry but did not include any nuclear measurements.{{sfn|ps=|Fleischmann|Pons|Anderson|Li|1990}}

Nevertheless, Fleischmann and Pons and a number of other researchers who found positive results remained convinced of their findings.{{sfn|ps=|Browne|1989}} The University of Utah asked Congress to provide $25 million to pursue the research, and Pons was scheduled to meet with representatives of President Bush in early May.{{sfn|ps=|Browne|1989}}

On 30 April 1989, cold fusion was declared dead by the ''New York Times''. The ''Times'' called it a circus the same day, and the ''Boston Herald'' attacked cold fusion the following day.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taubes|1993|p=242}} (Boston Herald's is {{harvnb|Tate|1989}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 May 1989, the [[American Physical Society]] held a session on cold fusion in Baltimore, including many reports of experiments that failed to produce evidence of cold fusion. At the end of the session, eight of the nine leading speakers stated that they considered the initial Fleischmann and Pons claim dead, with the ninth, [[Johann Rafelski]], abstaining.{{sfn|ps=|Browne|1989}} [[Steven E. Koonin]] of [[Caltech]] called the Utah report a result of "''the incompetence and delusion of Pons and Fleischmann,''" which was met with a standing ovation.{{sfn|ps=|Taubes|1993|p=266}} [[Douglas R.

On 4 May, due to all this new criticism, the meetings with various representatives from Washington were cancelled.{{sfn|ps=|Taubes|1993|pp=267–268}}

From 8 May only the A&amp;M tritium results kept cold fusion afloat.{{sfn|ps=|Taubes|1993|pp=275, 326}}

In August 1989, in spite of this trend, the state of [[Utah]] invested $4.5 million to create the National Cold Fusion Institute.{{sfn|ps=|Joyce|1990}}

The [[United States Department of Energy]] organized a special panel to review cold fusion theory and research.{{sfn|ps=|US DOE|1989|p=39}} The panel issued its report in November 1989, concluding that results as of that date did not present convincing evidence that useful sources of energy would result from the phenomena attributed to cold fusion.{{sfn|ps=|US DOE|1989|p=36}} The panel noted the large number of failures to replicate excess heat and the greater inconsistency of reports of nuclear reaction byproducts expected by established [[conjecture]]. Nuclear fusion of the type postulated would be inconsistent with current understanding and, if verified, would require established conjecture, perhaps even theory itself, to be extended in an unexpected way. The panel was against special funding for cold fusion research, but supported modest funding of "focused experiments within the general funding system."{{sfn|ps=|US DOE|1989|p=37}} Cold fusion supporters continued to argue that the evidence for excess heat was strong, and in September 1990 the National Cold Fusion Institute listed 92 groups of researchers from 10 different countries that had reported corroborating evidence of excess heat, but they refused to provide any evidence of their own arguing that it could endanger their patents.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, no further DOE nor NSF funding resulted from the panel's recommendation.{{sfn|ps=|Mallove|1991|pp=246–248}} By this point, however, academic consensus had moved decidedly toward labeling cold fusion as a kind of "pathological science".&lt;ref name="nytdoe"&gt;

In March 1990 Dr. Michael H. Salamon, a Utah physicist, and nine co-authors reported negative results.

In early May 1990 one of the two A&amp;M researchers, [[Kevin Wolf]], acknowledged the possibility of spiking, but said that the most likely explanation was tritium contamination in the palladium electrodes or simply contamination due to sloppy work.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taubes|1993|pp=410–411}}, {{harvnb|Close|1992|pp=270, 322}}, {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|pp=118–119, 121–122}}&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1990 an article in ''Science'' by science writer [[Gary Taubes]] destroyed the public credibility of the A&amp;M tritium results when it accused its group leader [[John Bockris]] and one of his graduate students of spiking the cells with tritium.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Taubes|1993|pp=410–411, 412, 420}}, the Science article was {{harvnb|Taubes|1990}}, {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|pp=122, 127–128}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In October 1990 Wolf finally said that the results were explained by tritium contamination in the rods.{{sfn|ps=|Huizenga|1993|pp=122–123}} An A&amp;M cold fusion review panel found that the tritium evidence was not convincing and that, while they couldn't rule out spiking, contamination and measurements problems were more likely explanations,&lt;ref name="spiking"&gt;{{harvnb|Taubes|1993|pp=418–420}} "While it is not possible for us to categorically exclude spiking as a possibility, it is our opinion, that possibility is much less probable than that of inadvertent contamination or other explained factors in the measurements.", {{harvnb|Huizenga|1993|pp=128–129}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Bockris never got support from his faculty to resume his research.

On 30 June 1991 the National Cold Fusion Institute closed after it ran out of funds;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |ref=harv |mode=cs2 |title=National Cold Fusion Institute Records, 1988–1991|url=http://content.lib.utah.edu/cdm4/item_viewer.php?CISOROOT=/UU_EAD&amp;CISOPTR=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; it found no excess heat, and its reports of tritium production were met with indifference.{{sfn|ps=|Taubes|1993|p=424}}

On 1 January 1991, Pons left the University of Utah and went to Europe.{{sfn|ps=|Taubes|1993|p=424}}{{sfn|ps=|Huizenga|1993|p=184}} In 1992, Pons and Fleischman resumed research with [[Toyota Motor Corporation]]'s IMRA lab in France.{{sfn|ps=|Taubes|1993|p=424}} Fleischmann left for England in 1995, and the contract with Pons was not renewed in 1998 after spending $40 million with no tangible results.{{sfn|ps=|Taubes|1993|pp=136–138}} The IMRA laboratory stopped cold fusion research in 1998 after spending £12 million.{{sfn|ps=|Voss|1999}} Pons has made no public declarations since, and only Fleischmann continued giving talks and publishing papers.{{sfn|ps=|Taubes|1993|pp=136–138}}

== Revival and LENR ==
In the mid-1990s there was heated debate among scientists that promoted the room-temperature fusion and those who observed that isotopic shifts and heavy-element transmutations pointed not to fusion but to some sort of neutron-induced reaction.

In 1997, theorist Lewis Larsen looked at some of this data and suspected that a neutronization process was occurring in low-energy nuclear reactions (LENR). Physicist Allan Widom joined Larsen's team in 2004, and in 2006 they published a theory in the ''European Physical Journal C – Particles and Fields.''

The Widom–Larsen theory is consistent with existing physics.  Their theory explains nuclear reactions based on creation of ultra-low-momentum neutrons and their recapturing.  The reaction rate are based on collective many-body interactions and not on few-body interactions that had been presumed for Fleischmann–Pons experiment.

Ultimately, although their experiment did not show what Fleischmann and Pons thought it did, it prompted new exciting venues of research that may highly expand applications of theoretical particle physics&lt;ref name="LENR neutronization"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blogs.scientificamerican.com/guest-blog/its-not-cold-fusion-but-its-something/|title=It's Not Cold Fusion...

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2533">[[File:Acp tzero DSC00467.jpg| thumb|[[AC Propulsion]] backtracking genset trailer]]
A '''genset trailer''' is a [[range extender (vehicle)|range extending device]] for use with [[battery electric vehicle]]s consisting of an [[internal combustion engine]] and an [[electric generator]] (collectively called a [[engine-generator|genset]]).  They run on traditional fuels such as gasoline or diesel and are sized to provide the continuous power requirements for the vehicle they are used with.  Most small to midsized passenger vehicles would require {{convert|15|to|20|kW|hp|abbr=on}} for unlimited freeway travel using fuel.  Larger vehicles could require {{convert|30|kW|hp|abbr=on}} or more of power depending on how heavy or un-aerodynamic they happen to be. This essentially converts an electric vehicle into a series-hybrid.

One such trailer was the [[AC Propulsion]] backtracking Long Ranger range extending gasoline-fueled trailer, making it a gasoline-electric series [[plug-in hybrid electric vehicle]].  This trailer used a {{convert|500|cc|cuin|abbr=on}} Kawasaki engine with a {{convert|9.5|USgal|L impgal|abbr=on}} fuel tank and achieved {{convert|30|-|35|mpgus|L/100km mpgimp|abbr=on}}. It was rated at {{convert|20|kW|hp|abbr=on}} [[Direct current|DC]] output and could maintain {{convert|60|to|80|mph|km/h|abbr=on}}.

The disadvantages of genset trailers are gaseous emissions from the engine, system maintenance, the additional cost of fuel, and storage when it is not in use on the road.  Also, since it is a trailer, it is impractical for some motorists.  

Advantages of a genset trailer include improved efficiency over a dedicated series hybrid when the trailer is disconnected for local travel, additional cargo space and a simpler and more cost effective basic vehicle.  Similar to a series hybrid such a combined vehicle would require fewer batteries to achieve an effectively longer range.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9198">A '''hydrotrope'''  is a compound that solubilises hydrophobic compounds in aqueous solutions (by means other than [[micellar solubilization]]). Typically, '''hydrotropes''' consist of a [[hydrophilic]] part and a [[hydrophobic]] part (like [[surfactants]]) but the hydrophobic part is generally too small to cause spontaneous self-aggregation.&lt;br&gt;'''Hydrotropes''' do not have a [[critical concentration]] above which [[self-aggregation]] 'suddenly' starts to occur (as found for [[micelle]]- and [[Vesicle (biology and chemistry)|vesicle]]-forming surfactants, which have a [[critical micelle concentration]] or cmc and a [[critical vesicle concentration]] or cvc, respectively). Instead, some hydrotropes aggregate in a step-wise self-aggregation process, gradually increasing aggregation size. However, many '''hydrotropes''' do not seem to self-aggregate at all, unless a [[solubilisate]] has been added.  Hydrotropes are in use industrially. Examples of hydrotropes include [[urea]], [[tosylate]], [[cumenesulfonate]] and [[xylenesulfonate]].

The term ''hydrotropy'' was originally put forward by [[Carl Neuberg]]&lt;ref name=neuberg&gt;Neuberg, C., Biochem. Z., 1916, 76, 107.&lt;/ref&gt; to describe the increase in the solubility of a solute by the addition of fairly high concentrations of alkali metal salts of various organic acids. However, the term has been used in the literature to designate non-micelle-forming substances, either liquids or solids, organic or inorganic, capable of solubilizing insoluble compounds.

The chemical structure of the conventional Neuberg’s hydrotropic salts (proto-type, sodium benzoate) consists generally of two essential parts, an anionic group and a hydrophobic aromatic ring or ring system. The anionic group is involved in bringing about high aqueous solubility, which is a prerequisite for a hydrotropic substance. The type of anion or metal ion appeared to have a minor effect on the phenomenon.&lt;ref name=neuberg/&gt; On the other hand, planarity of the hydrophobic part has been emphasized as an important factor in the mechanism of hydrotropic solubilization&lt;ref&gt;Evstigneev, M.P., Evstigneev V.P., Hernandez Santiago A.A., Davies, David B. 2006. Effect of a mixture of caffeine and nicotinamide on the solubility of vitamin (B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) in aqueous solution. European Journal of Pharmaceutical Sciences 28 (1-2) 59-66.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Suzuki,H., Sunada, H., 1998. Mechanistic studies on hydrotropic solubilization of nifedipine in nicotinamide solution, Chem &amp; Pharm Bulletin.46 (1) 125-130.&lt;/ref&gt;

To form a hydrotrope, an aromatic hydrocarbon solvent is sulfonated creating an aromatic sulfonic acid. It is then neutralized with a base.&lt;ref name=Stanton2010&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stanton|first=Kathleen|author2=Caritas Tibazarwa |author3=Hans Certa |author4=William Greggs |author5=Donna Hillebold |author6=Lela Jovanovich |author7=Daniel Woltering |author8=Richard Sedlak |title=Environmental Risk Assessment of Hydrotropes in the United States, Europe, and Australia.|journal=Integrated Environmental Assessment and Management|year=2010|volume=6|issue=1|pages=155–163|doi=10.1897/IEAM_2009-019.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additives may either increase or decrease the solubility of a solute in a given solvent. These salts that increase solubility are said to ‘salt in’ the solute and those salts that decrease the solubility ‘salt out’ the solute. The effect of an additive depends very much on the influence, it has on the structure of water or its ability to compete with the solvent water molecules.&lt;ref&gt;Da Silva, R.C., Spitzer, M., Da Silva, L.H.M., Loh, W., 1999. Investigations on the mechanism of aqueous solubility increase caused by some hydrotropes, Thermochimica Acta., 328, 161-167.&lt;/ref&gt;
A convenient quantitation of the effect of a solute additive on the solubility of another solute may be obtained by the
Setschetow equation:&lt;ref&gt;Singhai, A., 1992. Studies on solubilization, formulation and evaluation of some drugs, Dept. of Pharm. Sci. Dr. H. S. Gaur vishwavidhyalaya., Sagar, 10.&lt;/ref&gt;

: &lt;math&gt;\log{\frac {S_0}{S}} = K \cdot C_a&lt;/math&gt;; where

: S&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; = solubility in the absence of the additive

: S = solubility in the presence of the additive

: C&lt;sub&gt;a&lt;/sub&gt; = concentration of the additive

: K = salting coefficient, which is a measure of the sensitivity of the activity coefficient of the solute towards the salt.

== Applications  ==
Hydrotropes are in use industrially and commercially in cleaning and personal care product formulations to allow more concentrated formulations of surfactants. About 29,000 metric tons are produced (i.e., manufactured and imported) annually in the US.&lt;ref name=Stanton2010 /&gt; Annual production (plus importation) in Europe and Australia is approximately 17,000 and 1,100 metric tons, respectively.&lt;ref name="HERA2005"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.heraproject.com/files/24-F-HERA%20Hydrotropes%20Sept%202005.pdf|title=Hydrotropes|last=Human &amp; Environmental Risk Assessment on ingredients of household cleaning products (HERA)|year=2005|work=Risk Assessment}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SIDS&gt;{{cite web|last=Hydrotropes Consortium |title=SIDS Initial Assessment Report for SIAM 21 Hydrotropes. |url=http://www.chem.unep.ch/irptc/sids/OECDSIDS/Hydrotropes.pdf |year=2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130402032100/http://www.chem.unep.ch/irptc/sids/OECDSIDS/Hydrotropes.pdf |archivedate=2013-04-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Adenosine triphosphate (ATP) has been shown to be a hydrotrope able to prevent aggregation of proteins at normal physiologic concentrations and to be approximately an order of magnitude more effective than sodium xylene sulfonate in a classic hydrotrope assay.&lt;ref name="PatelMalinovska2017"/&gt; The hydrotrope activity of ATP was shown to be independent of its activity as an "energy currency" in [[cell (biology)|cells.]]&lt;ref name="PatelMalinovska2017"/&gt;

== Environmental Considerations ==
Hydrotropes have a low [[bioaccumulation]] potential, as the octanol:water partition coefficient  is &lt;1.0.&lt;ref name=Stanton2010/&gt; Studies have found hydrotopes to be very slightly volatile, with vapour pressures &lt;2.0x10-5 Pa.&lt;ref name=Stanton2010/&gt; They are aerobically biodegradable.  Removal via the secondary wastewater treatment process of activated sludge is &gt;94%.&lt;ref name=SIDS/&gt;  Acute toxicity studies on fish show an LC50 &gt;400&amp;nbsp;mg active ingredient (a.i.)/L.  For Daphnia, the EC50 is &gt;318&amp;nbsp;mg a.i./L.  The most sensitive species is green algae with EC50 values in the range of 230–236&amp;nbsp;mg a.i./ L and No Observed Effect Concentrations (NOEC)  in the range of 31–75&amp;nbsp;mg  a.i./L.&lt;ref name=SIDS/&gt; The aquatic Predicted No Effect Concentration (PNEC) was found to be 0.23&amp;nbsp;mg a.i./L.&lt;ref name=HERA2005/&gt; The Predicted Environmental Concentration (PEC)/PNEC ratio has been determined to be &lt; 1 and, therefore, hydrotropes in household laundry and cleaning products have been determined to not be an environmental concern.&lt;ref name=Stanton2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=HERA2005/&gt;

== Human Health ==
Aggregate exposures to consumers (direct and indirect dermal contact, ingestion, and inhalation) have been estimated to be 1.42&amp;nbsp;ug/Kg bw/day.&lt;ref name=HERA2005/&gt; 
Animal studies do not suggest sensitization, but there are no reliable human data available.&lt;ref name=SIDS/&gt; Calcium xylene sulfonate and sodium cumene sulfonate have been shown to cause temporary, slight eye irritation in animals.&lt;ref name=SIDS/&gt;  Studies have not found hydrotropes to be mutagenic, carcinogenic or have reproductive toxicity.&lt;ref name=SIDS/&gt;

'''Kosovo A Power Station''' is a lignite power station with five units at [[Obilić]], [[Kosovo]].{{efn|name=status}} It is the second largest power station in Kosovo with capacity of 650&amp;nbsp;MW after [[Kosovo B Power Station]]. It is described as the worst single-point source of pollution in Europe and it is expected to be closed by 2017.&lt;ref name=wb&gt;

==History==
Kosovo A Power Station was opened in 1962. It was operated by [[EPS Surface Mining Kosovo]] and [[EPS TPP Kosovo]] until the end of [[Kosovo War]]. After [[United Nations Interim Administration Mission in Kosovo|UNMIK]] administration was established in Kosovo on 1 July 1999, [[Elektroprivreda Srbije]] (EPS) lost its access to the local coal mines and power plants, including Kosovo A and [[Kosovo B Power Station|Kosovo B]] power plants.&lt;ref name="eps - au"&gt;{{cite web|title=About Us|url=http://www.eps.rs/Eng/Article.aspx?lista=Sitemap&amp;id=9|website=eps.rs|accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since then, it is operated by Korporata Energjetike e Kosovës (KEK).

In December 2015, US-based company ContourGlobal signed a memorandum of understanding with the [[Government of Kosovo]], to build a new [[USD|$]]1.06 billion worth power plant to replace 45-year old Kosovo A Power Station.&lt;ref name="new_plant18"&gt;{{cite news|title=US ContourGlobal to launch tendering for Kosovo power plant construction in April|url=https://seenews.com/news/us-contourglobal-to-launch-tendering-for-kosovo-power-plant-construction-in-april-560094|accessdate=15 January 2018|work=seenews.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; The construction is expected to start in 2018.&lt;ref name="new_plant18" /&gt;

==Generation units==
* Unit 1 has a generation power of 50 MW and a {{convert|120|m}} tall chimney with a diameter of {{convert|4|m}} at the top.
* Unit 2 has a generation power of 200 MW and a {{convert|120|m}} tall chimney with a diameter of {{convert|7|m}} at the top.
* Unit 3 has a generation power of 250 MW and a {{convert|120|m}} tall chimney with a diameter of {{convert|7|m}} at the top.

==Events==

===2014===
On 6 June 2014, the power station exploded killing two people and injuring 13 others. The station was then subsequently shut down. The cause of the explosion was due to the explosion of [[hydrogen tank]] located in a separate part of the power station from the [[electric generator|generator]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rte.ie/news/2014/0606/622005-kosovo/ |title=Explosion at Kosovo power plant - RTÉ News |publisher=Rte.ie |date= |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-27734312 |title=BBC News - Two killed in Kosovo power station blast near Pristina |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=1970-01-01 |accessdate=2014-06-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Walag |title= Coal Combustion from Power Plant Industry Inmisamis Oriental, Philippines: a Potential Groundwater Contamination and Heavy Metal Detection |journal=Asian Journal of Microbiology, Biotechnology &amp; Environmental Sciences |volume=18 |issue=1 |year=2016 |pages=55–59 |issn=0972-3005 |url=https://www.academia.edu/24631111/Coal_Combustion_from_Power_Plant_Industry_in_Misamis_Oriental_Philippines_A_Potential_Groundwater_Contamination_and_Heavy_Metal_Detection |access-date=2016-04-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{not in citation|date=April 2016}}&lt;!-- the word "lixiviation" is not used in the referenced article --&gt;.

In a typical leaching operation, the solid mixture to be separated consists of particles, [[Chemically inert|inert]] insoluble carrier A and [[Solution|solute]]&amp;nbsp;B. The [[solvent]],&amp;nbsp;C, is added to the mixture to selectively dissolve&amp;nbsp;B. The overflow from the stage is free of solids and consists of only solvent C and dissolved&amp;nbsp;B. The underflow consists of slurry of liquid of similar composition in the liquid overflow and solid carrier&amp;nbsp;A. In an ideal leaching [[wikt: equilibrium| equilibrium]] stage, all the solute is dissolved by the solvent; none of the carrier is dissolved. The mass ratio of the solid to liquid in the underflow is dependent on the type of equipment used and properties of the two phases.

Leaching is the process by which inorganic, organic contaminants or radionuclides are released from the solid phase into the water phase under the influence of mineral [[dissolution (chemistry)|dissolution]], [[desorption]], [[complexation]] processes as affected by pH, [[redox]], dissolved organic matter and (micro)[[biological activity]]. The process itself is universal, as any material exposed to contact with water will leach components from its surface or its interior depending on the [[porosity]] of the material considered.

One such reaction is:
:Ag&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S + 4NaCN → 2Na[Ag(CN)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;] + Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;S

==Leaching processes for biological substances==

Many biological organic and inorganic substances occur in a mixture of different components in a solid. In order to separate the desired solute constituent or remove an undesirable solute component from the solid phase, the solid is brought into contact with a liquid. The solid and liquid are in contact, and the solute or solutes can diffuse from the solid into the solvent, resulting in separation of the components originally in the solid. This separation process is called ''liquid-solid leaching'' or simply ''leaching''. Because in leaching the solute is being extracted from the solid this is also called ''extraction''. In leaching, when an undesirable component is removed from a solid with water, the process is called ''washing''.&lt;ref name=Geankoplis&gt;{{cite book|last=Geankoplis|first=Christie|title=Transport Process and Separation Principles|year=2004|publisher=Pretence Hall|location=NJ|isbn=978-0-13-101367-4|pages=802–817}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the biological and food processing industries, many products are separated from their original natural structure by liquid-solid leaching. An important process for example is the leaching of sugar from [[sugar beet]]s with hot water. In the production of vegetable oils, organic solvents such as [[hexane]], [[acetone]], or [[ether]] are used to extract oil from nuts, beans, and seeds.

In the pharmaceutical industry, many different pharmaceutical products are obtained by leaching plant roots, leaves, and stems.&lt;ref name=Geankoplis/&gt;

==Leaching processes for inorganic and organic materials==
Leaching is extensively used in metal processing industries. The useful metal may occur in mixtures with very large amounts of undesirable constituents, and leaching is used to remove the metals as soluble salts.&lt;ref name=Geankoplis/&gt; The use of acids is prevalent in the metal processing industry. [[Sulfate]]s are normally used to remove metals from the solid phase.  These processes result in harmful sulfate-rich environmental byproducts. Because acids solubilize metals, large-scale release of heavy-metal-rich acidic mine drainage (AMD) can thereby occur.

==Shrinking-core model==
As mentioned above when leaching a solid with a liquid the desired solid goes to the liquid phase while undesired solid remains. The removal of the solid as the liquid dissolves into the particle leads to a diameter of unleached core that shrinks with time. A mathematical model can be used for this process, derived using [[Fick's law of diffusion]] taking pore diffusion as rate limiting step:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Seader and Henley|first=J.D. and Ernest J.|title=Separation Process Principles|year=2001|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons inc.|location=U.K|isbn=978-0-471-46480-8|pages=639–641}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
:&lt;math&gt;t=\frac{\rho _Br_s^2}{6D_ebM_Bc_{A_b}} \left[ 1-3 \left(\frac{r_c}{r_s}\right)^2 + 2 \left(\frac{r_c}{r_s}\right)^3 \right]&lt;/math&gt;

==Environmentally friendly leaching==
Some recent work has been done to see if organic acids can be used to leach [[lithium]] and [[cobalt]] from spent [[Battery (electricity)|batteries]] with some success. Experiments performed with varying temperatures and concentrations of [[malic acid]] show that the optimal conditions are 2.0 m/L of organic acid at a temperature of 90 °C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Li|author2=Jing Ge |author3=Renjie Chen |author4=Feng Wu |author5=Shi Chen |author6=Xiaoxiao Zhang |title=Environmental friendly leaching reagent for cobalt and lithium recovery|journal=International Journal of Integrated Waste Management, Science and Technology|date=March 16, 2010|volume=30|series=Waste Management|issue=12|pages=2615–2621|url=http://www.journals.elsevier.com/waste-management/#description|accessdate=December 22, 2011|doi=10.1016/j.wasman.2010.08.008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction had an overall efficiency exceeding 90% with no harmful byproducts.

:4 LiCoO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(solid) + 12 C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(liquid) → 4 LiC&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;(liquid) + 4 Co(C&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(liquid) + 6 H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O(liquid) + O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;(gas)

The same analysis with [[citric acid]] showed similar results with an optimal temperature and concentration of 90 °C and 1.5 molar solution of citric acid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Li|first=Li|author2=Jing Ge |author3=Feng Wu |author4=Renjie Chen |author5=Shi Chen |author6=Borong Wu |title=Recovery of cobalt and lithium from spent lithium ion batteries using organic citric acid as leachant|journal=Journal of Hazardous Materials|date=2010-04-15|volume=176|issue=1-3|pages=288–293|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S030438940901810X|accessdate=December 22, 2011|doi=10.1016/j.jhazmat.2009.11.026}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3076">'''Louis Russell Glavis''' (1883&amp;ndash;1971) was an [[United States|American]] [[lawyer]] and an [[United States civil service|employee]] of the [[United States Department of the Interior]]. He was a prominent figure in the 1910 [[Pinchot-Ballinger Controversy]]; 
a political dispute between [[William Howard Taft|President Taft]]'s [[United States Secretary of the Interior|Secretary of Interior]], [[Richard Achilles Ballinger|Richard Ballinger]] and [[Conservation movement|conservation]]ist [[Gifford Pinchot]] over Governmental [[Conservation (ethic)|conservation]] policies.

In 1909, Glavis was an agent of  the  Department's [[General Land Office]]'s Field Division in the northwestern United States and was based in [[Portland, Oregon]]. He provided Pinchot with [[whistleblower|information]] about land deals in [[Alaska]] which he, Glavis, believed were illegal. Pinchot, in turn, accused Secretary Ballinger of providing Clarence Cunningham's syndicate of land claims that did not respect [[Theodore Roosevelt|Roosevelt]]'s conservation policies; policies Taft claimed to uphold in his administration.  These accusations led to the controversy. After a Senate hearing, Ballinger was exonerated and Glavis was fired on the grounds of insubordination by President Taft who supported Ballinger's position.&lt;ref&gt;Mowry. pp. 252-255.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1933, Glavis was rehired by incoming Secretary of Interior [[Harold L. Ickes]] as Chief of the Division of Investigation. This Division was responsible for investigating charges of corruption involving all the Department's many business contracts.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins. pp. 332-333&lt;/ref&gt; However, after three years, Ickes found Glavis to have a generally insubordinate nature. Glavis would conduct unauthorized surveillance of Department employees he felt were disloyal, for example. Ultimately, Glavis resigned from the Department in the summer of 1936 and was transferred to a Senate investigating committee.&lt;ref&gt;Watkins pp. 432-433.&lt;/ref&gt;  Later, Ickes wrote in his diary that he felt disappointed in Glavis, whom Ickes had once admired for his honesty; and that he had been unfairly unjust toward Ballinger, someone he had opposed in 1910, as he had also had to act in a similar way with Glavis.&lt;ref&gt;Ickes. p.550&lt;/ref&gt; In the biographical supplement that came with the Ickes diaries that were published in 1953, it is mentioned that Glavis had returned to a private law practice.

In the [[oil industry]] '''measured depth''' (commonly referred to as MD, or just the '''depth'''), is the length of the [[borehole]].&lt;ref name="Schlumberger"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.glossary.oilfield.slb.com/Display.cfm?Term=measured%20depth|title=Measured depth|last=Schlumberger|year=2011|work=Oilfield Glossary|accessdate=3 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In conventional vertical wells, this coincides with the [[true vertical depth]], but in [[directional well|directional]] or [[horizontal well|horizontal]] wells, especially those using [[extended reach drilling]], the two can deviate greatly. For example, at the time of writing (2012) a borehole in Odoptu field, [[Sakhalin-I]], has the greatest measured depth of any borehole at 12,345 m, but most of this is horizontal, giving it a true vertical depth of only 1,784 m. For comparison, the [[Kola Superdeep Borehole]] has a slightly shorter measured depth at 12,262 m, but since this is a vertical borehole, this is also equal to the true vertical depth, making the Kola Superdeep Borehole deeper by a factor of 6.9.

'''Niobium carbide''' ([[Niobium|Nb]][[Carbon|C]] and Nb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;C) is an extremely [[hardness|hard]] [[refraction (metallurgy)|refractory]] [[ceramic]] material, commercially used in [[tool bit]]s for cutting tools. It is usually processed by [[sintering]] and is a frequent additive as grain growth inhibitor in [[Cementation (metallurgy)|cemented]] carbides. It has the appearance of a brown-gray metallic powder with purple lustre. It is highly [[corrosion]] resistant.

Niobium carbide is a frequent intentional product in [[microalloyed steel]]s due to its extremely low solubility product in [[austenite]], the lowest of all the refractory metal carbides. This means that micrometre-sized precipitates of NbC are virtually insoluble in steels at all processing temperatures and their location at grain boundaries helps prevent excessive grain growth in these steels. This is of enormous benefit, and the cornerstone of microalloyed steels, because it is their uniform, very fine grain size that ensures both toughness and strength.
The only commonly occurring compound with a lower solubility and hence, greater potential for restricting the grain growth of steels is [[titanium nitride]].

Depending on grain size, niobium carbide may burn at 200-800&amp;nbsp;°C in air. A layer of niobium carbide can be created by [[chemical vapor deposition]]. [[Zirconium carbide]] and niobium carbide can be used as refractory coatings in [[nuclear reactor]]s.

==Synthesis==
Niobium carbide can be produced by the heating of Niobium oxide in a vacuum at 1800&amp;nbsp;°C and adding coke.

==Physical properties==
Niobium carbide has an [[Young's modulus]] of approximately 452GPa, and a shear modulus of 182GPa.&lt;ref name="LCM"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Brenton |first=R.|date=1969  |title= Elastic properties and thermal expansion of niobium mono-carbide to high temperatures |journal=Journal of the Less Common Metals|volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=273–278 |doi= 10.1016/0022-5088(69)90103-9|display-authors=etal}} [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0022508869901039 Abstract at Sciencedirect]&lt;/ref&gt;  It has a Poisson's ratio of 0.227.&lt;ref name="LCM" /&gt;

==Natural occurrence==

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2216">A '''nuclear power plant emergency response team''' (ERT) is an [[incident response team]] composed of plant personnel and civil authority personnel specifically trained to respond to the occurrence of an [[Nuclear and radiation accidents by country|accident]] at a [[nuclear power plant]].

Each nuclear power plant is required to have a detailed emergency plan.  In the event of a potential accident (as defined by the [[International Nuclear Event Scale]]), the ERT personnel are notified by beeper and have a set time limit for reporting to their duty station.

Potential duty stations include:
* The nuclear power plant's [[Control Room]]
* The nuclear power plant's Emergency Operations Facility
* An offsite (i.e., not near the nuclear plant) operations facility
* A news center
* Roving teams of [[health physicist]]s who scan for possible [[radiation]]
* Police traffic direction

In the United States, ERT personnel are required to train twice a year and typically train four times.  The [[Federal Emergency Management Agency|Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA)]] (with support from the [[Nuclear Regulatory Commission|Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC)]] and other agencies) grades some of the drills.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nrc.gov/reading-rm/doc-collections/commission/secys/2008/secy2008-0168/2008-0168scy.pdf Annual Update on the Status of Emergency Preparedness Activities]&lt;/ref&gt;  The drills normally are not announced in advance so as to simulate "surprise" conditions.

The '''Online Electric Vehicle''' '''(OLEV)''' is an electric vehicle that charges wirelessly while moving using [[electromagnetic induction]] (the wireless transfer of power through [[magnetic field]]s). It functions by using a segmented "recharging" road that induces a current in "pick-up" modules on the vehicle.

OLEV is the first public transport system that used a "recharging" road and was first launched on March 9, 2010 by The [[KAIST|Korea Advanced Institute of Science and Technology]] (KAIST).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/environment/article2948.ece|title=Korea unveils the ‘future of transport’ — the Online Electric Vehicle {{!}} The Times|last=Salmon|first=Andrew|date=2010-10-03|work=|newspaper=The Times|language=en-GB|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Mechanical Description ==
The OLEV system is split into two main parts: the segmented "recharging" road and the "pick-up" modules on the vehicle.

=== In the Road ===
In the "recharging" road, slim W-shaped [[ferrite core]]s (magnetic cores used in induction) are buried 30&amp;nbsp;cm underground in a fish bone like structure. Power cables are wrapped around the center of the fish bone structures to make the "primary coils". This design combines the magnetic fields of the two sides of the cables and shapes the fields in a way that maximizes induction. Moreover, the primary coils are placed in segments across certain spans of the road so that only about 5% to 15% of the road needs to be remodeled. To power the primary coils, the cables are attached to the South Korean national power grid through a [[power inverter]]. The inverter accepts 60Hz 3-phase 380 or 440 [[voltage]] from the grid to generate 20k[[Hertz|Hz]] of AC electricity into the cables. In turn, the cables create a 20&amp;nbsp;kHz magnetic field that sends [[flux]] through the slim ferrite cores to the pick-ups  on the OLEV.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Shim|first=H.

=== On the OLEV ===
Attached beneath the vehicle, are "pick-up" modules, or the secondary coils, that consist of wide W-shaped ferrite cores with wires wrapped around the center. When the pick-ups "pick up" the flux from the primary coils, each pick-up gains about 17&amp;nbsp;kW of power from the induced current. This power is sent to the electric motor and battery through a [[Regulator (automatic control)|regulator]] (a managing device that can distribute power based on need), thereby charging the OLEV wirelessly.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

As seen in the table above, the generation 1 OLEV lacks a realistic margin for error. The lower current means a smaller magnetic field and requires the secondary coil to be very close to the floor, which can be an issue while driving. Moreover, if the primary and secondary coils are vertically misaligned by a distance over 3mm, the power efficiency drops greatly.

To fix these issues, KAIST came up with the generation 2 OLEV. In the gen 2 OLEV, the current in the primary coil was doubled to create a stronger magnetic field that allows for a larger air gap. The ferrite cores in the primary coils were changed to a U shape and the cores in the secondary coil were changed a flat board shape to pick-up as much flux as possible. This design allows the vertical misalignment to be about 20&amp;nbsp;cm with a 50% power efficiency. However, the U shaped cores also require return cables which bumps up the cost of production. Overall, the gen 2 made up for the gen 1's margins but, was more costly.

In response to the cost issue of gen 2, the third generation OLEV was developed. The third generation OLEV, uses ultra-slim W-shaped ferrite cores in the primary coil to reduce the amount of ferrite used to 1/5 of gen 2 and to remove the need of return cables. The secondary coil uses a thicker variation of the w-shaped cores as a way to make up for the lesser area for the magnetic flux to flow through compared to gen 2. Overall, the gen 3 OLEV made up for the gen 1's small margins and gen 2's increased cost.

The '''Ontario Power Company Generating Station''' is a former generating station located along the [[Niagara River]] in [[Niagara Falls]], Ontario, Canada, slightly upstream from the [[Rankine Generating Station]].

==Background==
In 1890, the US [[Niagara Falls Hydraulic Power and Manufacturing Company]] and its subsidiary Cataract Company formed the International Niagara Commission composed of experts, to analyze proposals to harness [[Niagara Falls]] on the US/Canada border to generate power. They settled on [[alternating current]], or AC, electricity as being the preferred transmission method and, after going through many proposals. In 1893, they awarded the generating contract to [[Westinghouse Electric (1886)|Westinghouse Electric]] with further transmission lines and transformer contracts awarded to [[General Electric]].&lt;ref&gt;Robert L. Bradley, Jr., ''Edison to Enron: Energy Markets and Political Strategies'', John Wiley &amp; Sons - 2011, page 40&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Quentin R. Skrabec, ''The 100 Most Significant Events in American Business: An Encyclopedia'', ABC-CLIO - 2012, page 113&lt;/ref&gt; Work began in 1893 and in November 1896, power generated from Niagara Falls at the [[Adams Power Plant Transformer House|Edward Dean Adams Power Plant]] was being sent to [[Buffalo, New York]] as well as the Niagara Falls plants of the [[Pittsburgh Reduction Company]] which needed large quantities of cheap electricity for [[smelting]] aluminum.&lt;ref name="Mark Essig 2009, page 274"&gt;Mark Essig, Edison and the Electric Chair: A Story of Light and Death, Bloomsbury Publishing USA - 2009, page 274&lt;/ref&gt;

A similar set of events were happening on the Canadian side of the falls. In June 1887, recognizing an opportunity, the [[Ontario Hydro|Ontario Power Company]] of Niagara Falls was incorporated in Canada “to supply manufacturers, corporations, and persons with water, hydraulic, electric or other power.” While its operations were in [[Queen Victoria Park]] in [[Niagara Falls, Ontario]], its executive office was in Buffalo with the following officers: Albright, president; [[Francis Vinton Greene|Francis V. Greene]], vice-president; and Robert C. Board, [[Corporate Secretary|secretary]] and treasurer.

In 1903, the Company obtained an agreement with the Commissioners of the [[Queen Victoria Park|Queen Victoria Niagara Falls Park]] that allowed the company to develop at least 180,000 [[horsepower]] of [[electricity]]. The company built its [[hydroelectric]] [[generating plant]], which opened in 1905, at the base of the [[Horseshoe Falls]] just above river level.  The plant had 15 generators, which produced 203,000 horsepower of [[electric power]],&lt;ref name="The Ontario Power Company"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Ontario Power Company|url=http://www.niagarafallsinfo.com/history-item.php?entry_id=1441&amp;current_category_id=248|website=niagarafallsinfo.com|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was designed and built by [[L. L. Nunn|L.L. Nunn]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/900243298|title=The electric edge of academe : the saga of Lucien L. Nunn and Deep Springs College|last=1938-|first=Newell, L. Jackson,|isbn=9781607814061|location=Salt Lake City, Utah|oclc=900243298}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1904, Albright hired Buffalo [[architect]] [[Edward Brodhead Green|E. B. Green]] to design the [[Beaux-Arts architecture|Beaux-Arts]] ''Ontario Power Company'' buildings, Murray Street at Buchanan Avenue, including the Entrance Pavilion, Spillway Building, Office &amp; Transformer Station, Gate House, Screen House, and ‘’Ontario Power Company Generating Station’’ at river level.

The [[hydroelectric]] [[generating plant]] worked by allowing water to enter the generating station from an [[inlet]] located one mile upstream of [[Niagara Falls]], near [[Dufferin Islands]], and was then brought to the plant through buried conduit pipes and steel [[penstock]]s tunneled through the rock.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ontario Power Company|url=http://www.niagarafrontier.com/power.html#Ontpower|website=niagarafrontier.com|publisher=Niagara Falls (Ontario) Public Library|accessdate=20 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The conduits, two steel and one wooden (bound with iron hoops and encased in cement), ran underground 6,180 feet (1,884 meters) to the top of the generating station. There, each conduit connected with six [[penstock]]s, six feet in diameter. At the point where the conduits and the penstocks join, there was a section which turned upwards into a [[spillway]], called a [[surge tank]].  The [[surge tank]]s served to reduce fluctuations in heat and pressure during both the increase and decrease of loads. The open spillways sent any excess water to the [[Niagara River]] if the load suddenly reduced, which prevented any unwanted rise in pressure.

From the distributing station, the [[transmission line]]s carried power at 60,000 [[volt]]s each with a capacity of 40,000 [[kilowatt]]s, running over a right of way that was 300 feet wide and 32,000 feet long. This ran north to an area down the [[Niagara River]] known as [[Devil's Hole State Park|Devil's Hole]], where they then crossed the [[Niagara River]] into [[New York State]] across a 1,300 feet long span. In addition to the high tension [[Electric power distribution|feeders]], there were approximately 30 miles of lines serving [[Canada|Canadian]] customers at generator voltage.

The power that was transmitted to [[New York State]] was then sold in bulk to [[The Niagara Lockport and Ontario Power Company|Niagara Lockport and Ontario Power Company]], a New York company, which was then distributed to individual customers.  The largest individual consumers of power from these lines included several entities with direct ties to Albright: The [[Lackawanna Steel Company]], [[Empire State Railway]], [[New York Central Railroad]], the [[Shenandoah Steel Wire Company]], the [[Syracuse Consolidated Street Railway|Syracuse Rapid Transit Railway Company]], the [[Lockport Gas and Electric Light Company]], the [[Auburn Light Heat and Power Company]], the [[Erie Railroad|Erie Railroad Company]], and the [[Genesee County Electric Light Power and Gas Company]].

The plant continued to operate until 1999 when [[Ontario Power Generation]] (formerly [[Ontario Hydro]]) decommissioned the Ontario Power Company Generating Station from service in order to accommodate the construction of [[Niagara Fallsview Casino Resort]], built on the former transformer building location.

As of 2015, the 1905 Generating Station along the [[Niagara River]] edge is owned by the [[Niagara Parks Commission]], and sits abandoned.&lt;ref name="The Ontario Power Company"/&gt;

'''Pentamethylantimony''' or '''pentamethylstiborane''' is an [[organometalllic compound]] containing five [[methyl group]]s bound to an [[antimony]] atom with formula Sb(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.  It is an example of a [[hypervalent]] compound.

Pentamethylantimony can be made by reacting Sb(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Br&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; with two equivalents of [[methyl lithium]].&lt;ref name="wallen"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wallenhauer|first1=Stephan|last2=Seppelt|first2=Konrad|title=Antimony(V) and Bismuth(V) Methyl Compounds: A Structural Comparison|journal=Inorganic Chemistry|date=January 1995|volume=34|issue=1|pages=116–119|doi=10.1021/ic00105a021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another production route is to convert [[trimethylstibine]] to the trimethyl antimony dichloride, and then replace the chlorine with methyl groups with methyl lithium.&lt;ref name=haal/&gt;

==Properties==
Pentamethylantimony is colourless.&lt;ref name="wallen"/&gt; At -143°V it crystallizes in the [[orthorhombic]] system with [[space group]] ''Ccmm''. Unit cell dimensions are a=6.630&amp;nbsp;Å b=11.004&amp;nbsp;Å c=11.090&amp;nbsp;Å.  There are four formula per unit cell. Unit cell volume is 809.1&amp;nbsp;Å&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.&lt;ref name="wallen"/&gt; The trigonal bipyramid shape has three equatorial positions for carbon, and two axial positions at the peaks of the pyramids. The length of the antimony-carbon bond is around 214&amp;nbsp;pm for equatorial methyl groups and 222&amp;nbsp;pm for the axial positions. The bond angles are 120° for ∠C-Sb-C across the equator, and 90° for ∠C-Sb-C between equator and axis.&lt;ref name="wallen"/&gt; The molecules rapidly change carbon atom position, so that in NMR spectrum as low as −100°C, there is only one kind of hydrogen position.&lt;ref name=haal&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Haaland|first1=Arne|last2=Hammel|first2=Andreas|last3=Rypdal|first3=Kristin|last4=Swang|first4=Ole|last5=Brunvoll|first5=Jon|last6=Gropen|first6=Odd|last7=Greune|first7=Michael|last8=Weidlein|first8=Johann|last9=Nasiri|first9=Ahmad|last10=Okada|first10=Yoshito|title=Molecular Structure of Pentamethylantimony by Gas Electron Diffraction; Structure and Bonding in Sb(CH3)5 and Bi(CH3)5 Studied by Ab Initio MO Calculations.|journal=Acta Chemica Scandinavica|date=1993|volume=47|pages=368–373|doi=10.3891/acta.chem.scand.47-0368}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pentamethylantimony is more stable than [[pentamethylbismuth]], because in lower energy [[trimethylbismuth]], the non-bonding pair of electrons is more shielded due to the f-electrons and the [[lanthanoid contraction]]. [[Trimethylantimony]] is higher in energy, and thus less is released in a decomposition of pentamethylantimony.&lt;ref name="wallen"/&gt; Pentamethylantimony can be stored as a liquid in clean glass at room temperature.&lt;ref name=downs/&gt;

Pentamethylantimony melts at -19°C. Although it decomposes when boiling is attempted and can explode, it has a high vapour pressure at 8&amp;nbsp;mmHg at 25°C.&lt;ref name=downs&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Downs|first1=A.

There are two absorption bands in the ultraviolet at 2380 and 2500&amp;nbsp;Å.&lt;ref name=downs/&gt;

==Reactions==
Pentamethylantimony reacts with methyl lithium to yield a colourless lithium hexamethylantimonate in [[tetrahydrofuran]].&lt;ref name="wallen"/&gt;

:Sb(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt; + LiCH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; → Li(thf)Sb(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;

Pentamethylantimony reacts with silsesquioxanes to yield tetramethylstibonium silsesquioxanes. eg (''cyclo''-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; yields (''cyclo''-C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;11&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;Si&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;(OSB(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

[[Phosphonic acid]]s and [[phosphinic acid]]s combine with pentamethylantimony to yield compounds like (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SbOP(O)Ph&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SbOP(O)(OH)Ph and (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;SbOP(O)(OH)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, eliminating methane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Graves|first1=Guy E.|last2=Van Wazer|first2=John R.|title=Methyl group replacement on pentamethylantimony with organophosphorus substituents|journal=Journal of Organometallic Chemistry|date=May 1978|volume=150|issue=2|pages=233–237|doi=10.1016/S0022-328X(00)84725-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Stannocene]] Sn(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; combines with pentamethylantimony to produce bis(tetramethylstibonium)tetracyclopentadienylstannate ([(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Sb]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;Sn(C&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bos|first1=Klaas D.|last2=Bulten|first2=Eric J.|last3=Meinema|first3=Harry A.|last4=Noltes|first4=Jan G.|title=Synthesis of bis(tetramethylstibonium)tetracyclopentadienylstannate a novel type of organotin(II) compound|journal=Journal of Organometallic Chemistry|date=20 March 1979|volume=168|issue=2|pages=159–162|doi=10.1016/s0022-328x(00)83270-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pentamethylantimony reacts with many very weak acids to form a tetramethylstibonium salt or tetramethylstibonium derivative with the acid.  Such acids include water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[alcohol]]s, [[thiol]]s, [[phenol]], [[carboxylic acid]]s, [[hydrogen fluoride]], [[thiocyanic acid]], [[hydrazoic acid]], [[difluorophosphoric acid]], [[thiophosphinic acid]]s, and alkylsilols.&lt;ref name=aoc&gt;{{cite book|author=Hubert Schmidbaur|title=Advances in Organometallic Chemistry|date=1976|publisher=Academic Press|isbn=9780080580159|url=https://books.google.com.au/books?id=rhM8auhrK5MC&amp;pg=PA235|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With halogens, pentamethylantimony has one or two methyl groups replaced by the halogen atoms.&lt;ref name=aoc/&gt; Lewis acids also react to form tetramethyl stibonium salts, including [(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Sb]TlBr&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, [(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;Sb][CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;SbCl&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;], &lt;ref name=aoc/&gt;

Pentamethylantimony reacts with the surface of [[silica]] to coat it with Si-O-Sb(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; groups. Over 250°C this decomposes to Sb(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;) and leaves methyl groups attached to the silica surface.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wang|first1=Y.|last2=Morrow|first2=B.

==Process description==
A hydrogen fueled [[proton exchange membrane fuel cell]], for example, uses [[hydrogen gas]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and oxygen (O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) to produce electricity and water (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O); a regenerative hydrogen fuel cell uses electricity and water to produce hydrogen and oxygen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nfcrc.uci.edu/2/ACTIVITIES/PROJECTS/hydrogen/ElectrolyzerandReversibleFuelCell.aspx |title=Electrolyzer and Reversible Fuel Cell |publisher=Nfcrc.uci.edu |accessdate=2009-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090618111819/http://www.nfcrc.uci.edu/2/ACTIVITIES/PROJECTS/hydrogen/ElectrolyzerandReversibleFuelCell.aspx |archivedate=2009-06-18 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.whec2008.com/abstract/450.asp |title=6th Framework Programme, Research – STREP program GenHyPEM n° 019802 and Global Energy |publisher=Whec2008.com |date=2008-06-19 |accessdate=2009-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2005/TM-2005-214032.pdf |title=Hydrogen-oxygen PEM regenerative fuel cell |format=PDF |accessdate=2009-09-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110303170325/http://gltrs.grc.nasa.gov/reports/2005/TM-2005-214032.pdf |archivedate=2011-03-03 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

When the fuel cell is operated in regenerative mode, the anode for the electricity production mode(fuel cell mode) becomes the cathode in the hydrogen generation mode (reverse fuel cell mode), and vice versa. When an external voltage is applied, water at the cathode side will undergo electrolysis to form hydrogen and oxide ions; oxide ions will be transported through the electrolyte to anode where it can be oxidised to form oxygen. In this reverse mode, the polarity of the cell is opposite to that for the fuel cell mode.  
The following reactions describe the chemical process in the hydrogen generation mode:

At cathode: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; → H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt;

At anode: O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; → 1/2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + 2e&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt;

Overall: H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O → 1/2O&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; + H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;

==Solid oxide regenerative fuel cell (SORFC)==
One example of RFC is solid oxide regenerative fuel cell. [[Solid oxide fuel cell]] operates at high temperatures with high fuel-to-electricity conversion ratios and it is a good candidate for high temperature electrolysis.&lt;ref name="Laguna-Bercero2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laguna-Bercero|title=Performance and Aging ofMicrotubular YSZ-based Solid Oxide Regenerative Fuel Cells|journal=Fuel Cells|date=30 July 2010|doi=10.1002/fuce.201000069|first1=M.

The state of the art for O&lt;sup&gt;2−&lt;/sup&gt; conducting yttria stabilized zirconia(YSZ) based SORFC using Ni–YSZ as the hydrogen electrode and LSM (or LSM–YSZ) as the oxygen electrode has been actively studied.&lt;ref name="Laguna-Bercero2010"/&gt; Dönitz and Erdle reported on the operation of YSZ electrolyte cells with current densities of 0.3 A cm&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; and 100% Faraday efficiency at only 1.07 V.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dönitz |first1=W. |last2=Erdle |first2=E. |title=High-temperature electrolysis of water vapor—status of development and perspectives for application |journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy |year=1985 |volume=10 |issue=5 |pages=291–295 |doi=10.1016/0360-3199(85)90181-8 |url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0360319985901818}}&lt;/ref&gt; The recent study by researchers from Sweden shows that ceria-based composite electrolytes, where both proton and oxide ion conductions exist, produce high current output for fuel cell operation and high hydrogen output for electrolysis operation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=zhu|first=Bin |author2=Ingvar Albinsson |author3=Camilla Andersson |author4=Karin Borsand |author5=Monika Nilsson |author6=Bengt-Erik Mellander|title=Electrolysis studies based on ceria-based composites|journal=Electrochemistry Communications|date=20 February 2006|volume=8|issue=3|pages=495–498|doi=10.1016/j.elecom.2006.01.011|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1388248106000269}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zirconia doped with scandia and ceria (10Sc1CeSZ) is also investigated as potential electrolyte in SORFC for hydrogen production at intermediate temperatures(500-750&amp;nbsp;°C).It is reported that 10Sc1CeSZ shows good behavior and produces high current densities, with suitable electrodes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Laguna-Bercero|first=M.A |author2=S.J.

Current density–voltage ( j–V) curves and impedance spectra are investigated and recorded. Impedance
spectra are realized applying an ac current of 1–2A RMS (root-mean-square) in the frequency range from 30&amp;nbsp;kHz
to 10&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; Hz. Impedance spectra shows that the resistance is high at low frequencies(&lt;10&amp;nbsp;kHz) and near zero at high frequencies(&gt;10&amp;nbsp;kHz).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Brisse|first=Annabelle |author2=Josef Schefold |author3=Mohsine Zahida|title=High temperature water electrolysis in solid oxide cells|journal=International Journal of Hydrogen Energy|date=October 2008|volume=33|issue=20|pages=5375–5382|doi=10.1016/j.ijhydene.2008.07.120|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0360319908008355}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Since high frequency corresponds to electrolyte activities, while low frequencies corresponds to electrodes process, it can be deduced that only a small fraction of the overall resistance is from the electrolyte and most resistance comes from anode and cathode. Hence, developing high performance electrodes are essential for high efficiency SORFC. Area specific resistance(ASR) can be obtained from the slope of j-V curve. Commonly used/tested electrodes materials are nickel/zirconia cermet (Ni/YSZ) and lanthanum-substituted strontium titanate/ceria composite for SORFC cathode, and lanthanum strontium manganite (LSM) for SORFC anode. Other anode materials can be lanthanum strontium ferrite
(LSF), lanthanum strontium copper ferrite(LSCuF) and lanthanum strontium cobalt ferrite (LSCoF). Studies show that Ni/YSZ electrode was less active in reverse fuel cell operation than in fuel cell operation,and this can be attributed to a diffusion-limited process in the electrolysis direction, or its susceptibility to aging in a high-steam environment,
primarily due to coarsening of nickel particles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Marina|first1=O. A.|last2=Pederson|first2=L. R.|last3=Williams|first3=M. C.|last4=Coffey|first4=G.

The '''safety testing of explosives''' involves the determination of various properties of the different energetic materials that are used in commercial, mining, and military applications. It is highly desirable to measure the conditions under which explosives can be set off for several reasons, including: safety in handling, safety in storage, and 
safety in use.

It would be very difficult to provide an absolute scale for sensitivity with respect to the different properties of [[explosives]]. Therefore, it is generally required that one or more compounds be considered a standard for comparison to those compounds being tested. For example, [[PETN]] is considered to be a [[primary explosive]] by some individuals, and a [[secondary explosive]] by others. As a general rule, PETN is considered to be either a relatively insensitive primary explosive, or one of the most sensitive secondary explosives. PETN may be detonated by striking with a hammer on a hard steel surface (a very dangerous thing to do), and is generally considered the least sensitive explosive with which this may be done. For these facts and other reasons, PETN is considered one standard by which other explosives are gauged.

Another explosive that is used as a calibration standard is [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]], which was afforded the arbitrary [[Figure of Insensitivity]] of 100. Other explosives could then be compared against this standard.

==Types of safety testing==
Because there are different ways to set off explosives, there are several different components to the safety testing of explosives:

* Impact testing. The impact testing of explosives is performed by dropping a fixed weight onto a prepared sample of the explosive to be tested from a given distance. The weight is released, impacts upon the sample, and the result is noted. The impact distances are determined and the results are analyzed by the sensitivity test and analysis methods selected. The two most common sensitivity test and analysis methods are the [[Bruceton analysis]] and [[Neyer d-optimal test]]. These methods allow the user to determine the 50% initiation level (the distance at which 50% of the samples will "go"), and a standard deviation. Impact testing may also be performed with liquid samples confined in special cells.
* Friction testing. There are several techniques through which explosives may be tested to determine their sensitivity to friction. One of the most popular is the ABL friction test, which uses a line of explosives on a prepared metal plate, placed in front of a specially prepared metal wheel that is forced down upon the plate with a hydraulic press. The metal plate is then struck with a pendulum to move it, squeezing the explosives between plate and wheel as the plate moves. Initiation is determined, and analyzed by the [[Bruceton analysis]] or [[Neyer d-optimal test]], as above. BAM friction testing is similar, except that the sample is placed on a ceramic plate which is then moved side-to-side as a ceramic peg exerts force on the sample.
* [[Electrostatic discharge]]. Testing for ESD, or [[electric spark|"spark"]] sensitivity of explosives is performed with a machine designed to discharge from a capacitor through a prepared sample. The [[Sandia National Labs]] design employs a dipping needle that punctures a sample cell and discharges the spark simultaneously. The amount of energy discharged into the cell becomes the variable in which [[Bruceton analysis]] or [[Neyer d-optimal test]] is performed to determine spark sensitivity.
* [[Thermal sensitivity]]. Determining the point at which a compound is capable of detonating under confinement with thermal stress is useful. A fixed quantity of material is placed in an aluminum blasting cap shell, and pressed into place with an aluminum plug. The sample is immersed in a hot metal bath, and the time-to-detonation is measured. If over 60 seconds, a fresh sample is run again at a higher temperature. In this manner, it is possible to determine the temperature at which an explosive will detonate on the small scale. Unlike the other tests above, this figure is misleading as explosives have more thermal issues on the large scale. Therefore, the thermal sensitivity figures established using this technique are higher than one would expect in the real world.  Thermal safety testing may also be performed via [[differential scanning calorimetry]], in which a small (sub-milligram) sample is placed in a sample cell, and the temperature is increased slowly. The calorimeter determines how much energy is required to increase the temperature of the sample. Using this device, characteristics such as the [[melting point]], [[phase transition]]s and decomposition temperature of an explosive may be determined.

Used together, these numbers may be used to determine the potential threats afforded by energetic materials when employed in the field. It cannot be stressed enough that these figures are relative; when we determine that impact sensitivity of an explosive is lower for that of a tested explosive than PETN, for example, the number produced in the impact test is dimensionless, but it means that it is expected that it would take a greater impact to detonate it than PETN. Therefore, an experienced ordnance technician who works with raw PETN will know that the new explosive is not as sensitive with regards to impact. However, it could be more sensitive to friction, spark, or thermal issues. These conditions must be taken into account before any compound is to be stored, handled, or used in the field.

'''Savonius wind turbines''' are a type of [[vertical-axis wind turbine]] (VAWT), used for converting the force of the [[wind]] into [[torque]] on a rotating [[Axle|shaft]]. The turbine consists of a number of aerofoils, usually—but not always—vertically mounted on a rotating shaft or framework, either ground stationed or tethered in [[Airborne wind turbine|airborne systems]].

== Origin ==
The Savonius wind turbine was invented by the [[Finland|Finnish]] engineer [[Sigurd Johannes Savonius]] in 1922. However, [[Europe]]ans had been experimenting with curved blades on vertical wind turbines for many decades before this. The earliest mention is by the Italian Bishop of Czanad, [[Fausto Veranzio]], who was also an engineer. He wrote in his 1616 book ''Machinae novae'' about several vertical axis wind turbines with curved or V-shaped blades. None of his or any other earlier examples reached the state of development made by Savonius. In his Finnish biography there is mention of his intention to develop a turbine-type similar to the Flettner-type, but autorotationary. He experimented with his rotor on small rowing vessels on lakes in his country. No results of his particular investigations are known, but the [[Magnus effect]] is confirmed by König.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author = Felix van König |url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=3790600776 |title = Windenergie in praktischer Nutzung |publisher = Pfriemer |date = 1978 |isbn = 3-7906-0077-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two Savonius patents: [https://www.google.com/patents/US1697574 US1697574], were filed in 1925 by Sigurd Johannes Savonius, and [https://www.google.com/patents/US1766765 US1766765], in 1928.

==Operation==
[[Image:Savonius turbine.svg|thumb|left|upright|alt=Two-scoop Savonius turbine|Schematic drawing of a two-scoop Savonius turbine]]

The Savonius turbine is one of the simplest turbines.  [[Aerodynamic]]ally, it is a [[Drag (physics)|drag]]-type device, consisting of two or three scoops. Looking down on the rotor from above, a two-scoop machine would look like an "S" shape in [[cross section (physics)|cross section]]. Because of the [[curvature]], the scoops experience less drag when moving against the wind than when moving with the wind.  The differential drag causes the Savonius turbine to spin.  Because they are drag-type devices, Savonius turbines extract much less of the wind's [[wind power|power]] than other similarly-sized lift-type turbines. Much of the swept area of a Savonius rotor may be near the ground, if it has a small mount without an extended post, making the overall energy extraction less effective due to the lower [[wind speed]]s found at lower heights.
{{-}}

==Power and rotational speed ==

According to [[Betz's law]], the maximum power that is possible to extract from a rotor is &lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{max}} = \frac{16}{27} \rho \cdot r \cdot h \cdot v^3&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\rho&lt;/math&gt; is the [[density of air]], &lt;math&gt;h&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; are the height and radius of the rotor and &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; is the wind speed. However, in practice the extractable power is about half that &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web| title = Increase in the Savonius rotors efficiency via a parametric investigation| work = ResearchGate| accessdate = 2017-06-02| url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/228957621_Increase_in_the_Savonius_rotors_efficiency_via_a_parametric_investigation}}&lt;/ref&gt; (one can argue that only one half of the rotor — the scoop co-moving with the wind — works at each instant of time). Thus, one gets &lt;math&gt;P_{\mathrm{max}} \approx 0.36\, \mathrm{kg\, m^{-3}} \cdot h \cdot r \cdot v^3&lt;/math&gt;.

The [[angular frequency]] of a rotor is given by &lt;math&gt;\omega = \frac{\lambda \cdot v}{r}&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is a dimensionless factor called the [[tip-speed ratio]]. ''λ'' is a characteristic of each specific windmill, and for a Savonius rotor ''λ'' is typically around unity.

For example, an oil-barrel sized Savonius rotor with ''h''={{val|1|u=m}} and ''r''={{val|0.5|u=m}} under a wind of ''v''={{val|10|u=m/s}}, will generate a maximum power of {{val|180|u=W}} and an angular speed of {{val|20|u=rad/s}} (190 revolutions per minute).

==Use==
[[Image:Taiwan 2009 JinGuaShi Historic Gold Mine Combined Darrieus Savonius Wind Turbines FRD 8638.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Combined [[Darrieus wind turbine|Darrieus]]-Savonius generator in [[Taiwan]]]]

Savonius turbines are used whenever cost or [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] is much more important than [[Energy conversion efficiency|efficiency]].

Most [[anemometer]]s are Savonius turbines for this reason, as efficiency is irrelevant to the application of measuring wind speed.  Much larger Savonius turbines have been used to generate [[electric]] power on deep-water [[buoy]]s, which need small amounts of power and get very little maintenance. Design is simplified because, unlike with horizontal axis wind turbines ([[Wind turbine#Horizontal axis|HAWT]]s), no pointing mechanism is required to allow for shifting wind direction and the turbine is self-starting.  Savonius and other vertical-axis machines are good at pumping water and other high torque, low rpm applications and are not usually connected to electric power grids. In the early 1980s Risto Joutsiniemi developed a [[:fi:Windside-roottori|helical rotor (wiki:fi)]] version that does not require end plates, has a smoother torque profile and is self-starting in the same way a crossed pair of straight rotors is.

The most ubiquitous application of the Savonius wind turbine is the [[Flettner rotor]], which is commonly seen on the roofs of vans and buses and is used as a cooling device. The ventilator was developed by the German aircraft engineer [[Anton Flettner]] in the 1920s. It uses the Savonius wind turbine to drive an extractor fan. The vents are still manufactured in the UK by Flettner Ventilator Limited.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flettner.co.uk/home.htm Flettner]&lt;/ref&gt;

Small Savonius wind turbines are sometimes seen used as advertising signs where the rotation helps to draw attention to the item advertised. They sometimes feature a simple two-frame [[animation]].

==Tethered airborne Savonius turbines==
* [[Airborne wind turbines]]
* Kite types
* When the Savonius rotor axis is set horizontally and tethered, then kiting results. There are scores of patents and products that use the net lift [[Magnus effect]] that occurs in the [[Autorotation (helicopter)|autorotation]] of the Savonius rotor. The spin may be mined for some of its energy for making noise, heat, or electricity.

==Formation==
Selenoyl fluoride can be formed by the action of warm [[fluorosulfonic acid]] on [[barium selenate]]&lt;ref&gt;''Advanced Inorganic Chemistry A Comprehensive Text'' Cotton and Wilkinson&lt;/ref&gt; or [[selenic acid]]. SeO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; + SeF&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; can give this gas along with other oxyfluorides.

==Reactions==
Selenoyl fluoride is more reactive than its analogon [[sulfuryl fluoride]]. It is easier to hydrolyse and to reduce. It may react violently upon contact with [[ammonia]].

Selenoyl fluoride reacting with [[xenon difluoride]] gives FXeOSeF&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.scribd.com/doc/30122309/Noble-Gas-Compounds&lt;/ref&gt;

'''TWISTEX''' (an [[acronym]] for '''T'''actical '''W'''eather-'''I'''nstrumented '''S'''ampling in/near '''T'''ornadoes '''Ex'''periment) is a [[tornado]] research experiment that was founded and led by [[Tim Samaras]] of [[Bennett, Colorado]], US.

==Background==
The project normally runs from mid-April through the end of June with a domain that covers the [[Great Plains]] and portions of the [[Midwestern United States]]. The project is normally at full strength for most of May and June with four vehicles, all equipped with roof-mounted mobile [[mesonet]] [[weather station]]s. One of the vehicles transports an array of [[in situ]] thermodynamic and video probes. Due to graduate and upper-division undergraduate student participant availability, a reduced vehicle compliment consisting of the in situ probe deployment truck and one support mesonet station vehicle is used in the first few weeks of the project.

The objectives of this research are to better understand tornado generation, maintenance and decay processes and to gain insight and knowledge of the seldom sampled near-surface internal tornado environment. Progress on these research fronts is aimed toward increasing tornado warning lead time while the internal tornado near-surface sampling provides essential ground truth data for structural engineering analysis of the interaction of tornadic winds with homes and buildings.&lt;ref&gt;twistex.org.&lt;/ref&gt;

TWISTEX is one of the featured teams in seasons 3, 4 and 5 of ''[[Storm Chasers (TV series)|Storm Chasers]]'' on the [[Discovery Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;Discovery Channel Online. [http://dsc.discovery.com/tv/storm-chasers/teams/teams-tab-06.html Meet The Teams, TWISTEX], 2009-11-25&lt;/ref&gt; The group has also been featured on [[National Geographic Channel]]'s "Disaster Labs".

On May 31, 2013, [[Tim Samaras]], his 24-year-old son Paul Samaras, and 45-year-old [[California]] native Carl Young lost their lives in the record wide EF3 [[Multiple-vortex tornado|multiple-vortex]] [[2013 El Reno tornado|El Reno tornado]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cnn.com/2013/06/02/us/midwest-weather/index.html?hpt=hp_t1|title='Unpredictable' storm in Oklahoma turned on three chasers - CNN|first=By Jake Carpenter and Catherine E. Shoichet,|last=CNN|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were unable to escape along gravel roads as the funnel rapidly expanded to envelop them. Their Chevrolet Cobalt was caught by a subvortex, and Paul and Carl were ejected from the car. Tim was buckled in the passenger's seat, and was killed as the car was thrown approximately half a mile by the storm. Dan Robinson of [[St. Louis]] was a few hundred yards from them, but successfully escaped with minor injuries. [[Hinton, Oklahoma|Hinton]] resident Richard Henderson, who decided to follow the twister, lost his life in that same area. He snapped a picture of the storm from his cellular phone before it struck him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Clay, Nolan |publisher=''[[The Oklahoman]]''|date=June 3, 2013|accessdate=June 4, 2013|title=Oklahoma storms: Amateur storm chaser took photo of tornado that killed him|url=http://newsok.com/article/3841315}}&lt;/ref&gt; Several other storm chasers, including [[The Weather Channel]]'s [[Mike Bettes]], were also caught in the same sub-vortex but escaped with only minor injuries. Bettes and the '''Tornado Hunt''' crew were lifted up by the [[Tornado#Size and shape|wedge tornado]] in their sport utility vehicle. That storm threw them two hundred yards off [[U.S. Route 81 in Oklahoma|U.S. Route 81]]. The SUV was destroyed afterward.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/weather-channels-storm-chasing-suv-561319|title=Weather Channel's Storm-Chasing SUV Destroyed by Tornado (Photo)|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Five other people who were not involved with storm chasing also lost their lives in this tornado.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://usnews.nbcnews.com/_news/2013/06/02/18696369-at-least-12-dead-after-rain-twisters-lash-mid-us-storms-head-east|title=At least 16 dead after rain, twisters lash mid-US; storms head east|first=U.S.|last=News|publisher=|accessdate=29 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tornado core sampling==
[[Image:TWISTEX HITPR Probe.jpg|thumb|300px|left|The HITPR probe used to take in-situ tornado measurements.]]

Several hardened instruments will be deployed in paths of tornadoes to collect the following datasets:
*[[Atmospheric pressure]]
*[[Temperature]]
*[[Humidity]]
*[[Wind speed]] and [[Wind direction|direction]]
*Visualization for accurate debris/[[hydrometeor]] velocities and for verification of the tornado-relative location of the in situ sampling

The [[Atmospheric thermodynamics|thermodynamic]] probes are called Hardened In-situ Tornado Pressure Recorders (HITPR). All of the hardened instrumentation can collect/store the datasets. Measurements are recorded at 10 samples/second, and stored on non-volatile flash cards.

TWISTEX will also have video probes that will provide visualization using 7 cameras each for a total of 14 cameras being deployed into the tornado core. Collectively the two camera probes will be used for [[photogrammetry]] purposes to visualize/measure tornado-driven debris and hydrometeors as well as for determining the tornado-relative location of the HITPRs.

New additional technologies will be used by deployment crew members to collect photogrammetric data from tornadoes as close as possible. One technique will be to record close tornado imagery using two digitally synchronized high-resolution high-speed cameras running at 500 frames per second for stereo photogrammetry techniques. This technique will provide excellent time resolution for velocity determination of low-level tornado core winds and lofted debris.

==Tornado proximity environment sampling==
[[File:TonyLaubach TWISTEX MesonetVehicles.JPG|thumb|Two of the TWISTEX mesonet vehicles, M1 and M2.]]

While there are abundant kinematic datasets gathered by mobile radar of the tornadic region of supercells, the number of quality mobile mesonet or sticknet thermodynamic datasets of the flow field proximate to the tornadic region, generally within the supercell [[rear-flank downdraft]] (RFD) outflow, are comparatively rare. Even rarer are mesonet datasets reaching within about 1.5&amp;nbsp;km of tornadoes and datasets sampling the thermodynamic evolution of the RFD [[Outflow (meteorology)|outflow]].

Each of the participating TWISTEX vehicles will have a mobile mesonet (MM) station mounted on the roof including the probe deployment truck. The mobile mesonet will be attempting to gather near-surface thermodynamic and kinematic data in as many quadrants of the RFD as possible. When coupled with the in-situ probe array data which represents another effective mesonet station, it is hoped to obtain thermodynamic and kinematic mapping that will describe characteristics of the flow reaching the tornado. Even if the hardened tornado probes do not take a direct hit, a peripheral tornado sampling is still very worthwhile.

'''Titanium carbide''', [[Titanium|Ti]][[Carbon|C]], is an extremely [[hardness|hard]] ([[Mohs scale of mineral hardness|Mohs]] 9–9.5) [[refractory]] [[ceramic]] material, similar to [[tungsten carbide]].  It has the appearance of black powder with the [[sodium chloride]] ([[Cubic crystal system#Rock-salt structure|face-centered cubic]]) [[crystal structure]]. As found in nature its crystals range in size from 0.1 to 0.3mm.

Titanium carbide is used in preparation of [[cermet]]s, which are frequently used to [[machining|machine]] [[steel]] materials at high cutting speed.  It is also used as an abrasion-resistant surface coating on metal parts, such as [[tool bit]]s and  watch mechanisms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.eduloc.com/products/511.html|title=Titanium carbide TiC powder cas 12070-08-5|last=|first=|date=|website=www.eduloc.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=June 2014}} Titanium carbide is also used as a [[heat shield]] coating for [[atmospheric reentry]] of [[spacecraft]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sforza|first1=Pasquale M.|title=Manned Spacecraft Design Principles|url=https://books.google.fr/books?id=ntWcBAAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA406&amp;ots=i1g3SbIaAy&amp;dq=titanium%20carbide%20heat%20shield&amp;hl=fr&amp;pg=PA406#v=onepage&amp;q=titanium%20carbide&amp;f=false|publisher=Elsevier|accessdate=4 January 2017|page=406|language=en|date=13 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It occurs in nature as a form of the very rare mineral ''{{Interlanguage link|khamrabaevite|en|Khamrabaevite|it|Khamrabaevite|WD=}}'' ({{Lang-ru|Хамрабаевит}}) - (Ti,V,Fe)C. It was discovered in 1984 on Mount Arashan in the Chatkal District,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dunn|first1=Pete J|title=New mineral names|journal= American Mineralogist|date=1985|volume=70|pages=1329–1335|url=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; USSR (modern [[Kyrgyzstan]]), near the Uzbek border. The mineral was named after Ibragim Khamrabaevich Khamrabaev, director of Geology and Geophysics of [[Tashkent]], [[Uzbekistan]].

==Physical properties==
Titanium carbide has an [[elastic modulus]] of approximately 400 GPa and a shear modulus of 188 GPa.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |url=http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/journal/jap/37/10/10.1063/1.1707923 |title=Low‐Temperature Elastic Properties of ZrC and TiC |last=Chang |first=R |last2=Graham |first2=L |date=1966 |journal=Applied Physics |publisher= |volume=37|pages=3778 |doi=10.1063/1.1707923}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tool bits without tungsten content can be made of titanium carbide in [[nickel]]-cobalt matrix [[cermet]], enhancing the cutting speed, precision, and smoothness of the workpiece.{{citation needed|date=September 2014}}

The resistance to [[wear]], [[corrosion]], and [[oxidation]] of a [[tungsten carbide]]–[[cobalt]] material can be increased by adding 6–30% of titanium carbide to tungsten carbide. This forms a [[solid solution]] that is more [[brittleness|brittle]] and susceptible to breakage.{{clarify|reason=why would that be an advantage?|date=July 2015}}

Titanium carbide can be [[Etching|etched]] with [[reactive-ion etching]].

Polarimetric radar can discern meteorological and nonmeteorological [[hydrometeor]]s and the co-location of a PTDS with the enhanced reflectivity of a debris ball are used by meteorologists as confirmation that a tornado is occurring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Tornadic Debris Signature from Dual Polarization Radar |publisher = NWS Birmingham, AL |date = October 3, 2012 |url = http://www.srh.noaa.gov/bmx/?n=weatherreview_1001 |accessdate = 2014-05-12 |archiveurl = |archivedate = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
[[File:Debris Ball Radar Products.jpg|thumb|left|Comparison of four radar products: reflectivity, Z, top left; velocity, SRM, top right; and polarimetric products, differential reflectivity, Z&lt;sub&gt;DR&lt;/sub&gt;, on bottom left; correlation coefficient, CC, on bottom right, used to identify TDSs]]
Debris balls can be a result of [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] or [[biomass]] debris and are more likely to occur if a tornado crosses a "target-rich" environment such as a forest or populated area. A TDS is most likely to be observed when a tornado is closer to a radar site and the farther away from the radar that a TDS is observed the more likely that the tornado is stronger. As a result of the strong [[wind]]s required to damage structures and loft debris into the air, debris balls are normally the result of EF3 or stronger tornadoes on the [[Enhanced Fujita Scale]]. Weaker tornadoes may also not cause debris balls due to their mostly short-lived nature and thus any debris may not be sampled by radar.&lt;ref name=jointpol&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ryzhkov|first=Alexander V.|author2=Schuur, Terry J. |author3=Burgess, Donald W. |author4=Heinselman, Pamela L. |author5=Giangrande, Scott E. |author6= Zrnic, Dusan S. |title=The Joint Polarization Experiment: Polarimetric Rainfall Measurements and Hydrometeor Classification|journal=Bull.

Debris balls are seen on radar reflectivity images as a small, roundish area of high reflectivity values. Research conducted on debris balls that were noted during the [[2011 Super Outbreak]] suggested that horizontal reflectivity from debris balls ranged from 51 to 72 [[dBZ (meteorology)|dBZ]] during those outbreaks. Reflectivity values also decreased with increasing height.&lt;ref name=tdsapr27 /&gt; Due to the irregular and variable size, shapes, and tumbling nature of tornadic debris, debris balls typically produce a [[Weather radar#Polarization|correlation coefficient]] (''ρ&lt;sub&gt;hv&lt;/sub&gt;'') less than 0.80. Differential reflectivity (''Z&lt;sub&gt;DR&lt;/sub&gt;'') values associated with debris balls are normally near or below 0&amp;nbsp;dB. Debris balls are almost always associated with a strong velocity couplet and the corresponding algorithm based detection, the [[tornado vortex signature]] (TVS) or tornado detection algorithm (TDA).&lt;ref name=tdslesson&gt;{{cite web|title=Dual-Pol Radar Applications: Tornadic Debris Signatures|url=http://www.wdtb.noaa.gov/courses/dualpol/Applications/TDS/player.html|publisher=National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration|accessdate=31 December 2012|author=Schlatter, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trigonelline is a product of niacin metabolism that is excreted in urine of mammals.&lt;ref&gt;''[[Merck Index]]'', 11th Edition, '''9606'''.&lt;/ref&gt;

Trigonelline occurs in many plants.

Trigonelline [[crystallization|crystallizes]] as a monohydrate from [[ethanol|alcohol]] in hygroscopic prisms (m.p.&amp;nbsp;130&amp;nbsp;°C or 218&amp;nbsp;°C [''dry, dec.'']). It is readily soluble in water or warm alcohol, less so in cold alcohol, and slightly so in [[chloroform]] or [[diethylether|ether]]. The salts crystallize well, the monohydrochloride, in leaflets, sparingly soluble in dry alcohol. The [[picrate]] forms shining prisms (m.p.&amp;nbsp;198−200&amp;nbsp;°C) soluble in water but sparingly soluble in dry alcohol or ether. The alkaloid forms several aurichlorides: the normal salt, B•HCl•AuCl&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, is precipitated when excess of [[gold chloride]] is added to the hydrochloride, and, after crystallization from dilute hydrochloric acid containing some gold chloride, has m.p.&amp;nbsp;198&amp;nbsp;°C. Crystallized from water or very dilute hydrochloric acid, slender needles of B&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;•3 HAuCl&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; (m.p.&amp;nbsp;186&amp;nbsp;°C) are obtained.

When trigonelline is heated in closed tubes with [[barium hydroxide]] at 120&amp;nbsp;°C, it gives rise to methylamine, and, if treated similarly with hydrochloric acid at 260&amp;nbsp;°C creates [[chloromethane]] and [[nicotinic acid]] (a form of vitamin B&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;). Trigonelline is a methyl [[betaine]] of nicotinic acid.&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.sciencemadness.org/library/books/the_plant_alkaloids.pdf ''The Plant Alkaloids'']&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4642">{{short description|A hypothesized form of dark matter that has properties intermediate between those of hot dark matter and cold dark matter}}
'''Warm dark matter''' ('''WDM''') is a hypothesized form of [[dark matter]] that has properties intermediate between those of [[hot dark matter]] and [[cold dark matter]], causing structure formation to occur bottom-up from above their free-streaming scale, and top-down below their free streaming scale. The most common WDM candidates are [[sterile neutrino]]s and [[gravitino]]s. The WIMPs ([[weakly interacting massive particles]]), when produced non-thermally could be candidates for warm dark matter. In general, however the thermally produced WIMPs are [[cold dark matter]] candidates.

==keVins and GeVins==
One possible WDM candidate particle with a mass of a few [[keV]] comes from introducing two new, zero charge, zero [[lepton number]] [[fermion]]s to the [[Standard Model]] of Particle Physics: "keV-mass inert fermions" (keVins) and "GeV-mass inert fermions" (GeVins). keVins are overproduced if they reach thermal equilibrium in the early universe, but in some scenarios the entropy production from the decays of unstable heavier particles can suppresses their abundance to the correct value. These particles are considered "inert" because they only have suppressed interactions with the [[W and Z bosons|Z boson]]. 
[[Sterile neutrinos]] with masses of a few keV are possible candidates for keVins. 
At temperatures below the [[electroweak scale]] their only interactions with standard model particles are [[weak interactions]] due to their [[Neutrino oscillations|mixing]] with ordinary [[neutrinos]]. Due to the smallness of the mixing angle they are not overproduced because they freeze out before reaching thermal equilibrium. Their properties are consistent with astrophysical bounds coming from structure formation and the [[Pauli principle]] if their mass is larger than 1-8 keV.

In February 2014, different analyses&lt;ref name=bulbul&gt;E. Bulbul ''et al.'' https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.2301
"Detection of An Unidentified Emission Line in the Stacked X-ray spectrum of Galaxy Clusters"&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=boyarski&gt;A. Boyarski ''et al.'': https://arxiv.org/abs/1402.4119,
 "An unidentified line in X-ray spectra of the Andromeda galaxy and Perseus galaxy cluster"&lt;/ref&gt; have extracted from the spectrum of X-ray emissions observed by [[XMM-Newton]], a monochromatic signal around 3.5 keV. This signal is coming from different [[galaxy cluster]]s (like [[Perseus]] and [[Centaurus]]) and several scenarios of warm dark matter can justify such a line. We can cite, for example, a 3.5 keV candidate annihilating into 2 photons,&lt;ref name=annihilating&gt;E. Dudas, L. Heurtier, Y. Mambrini:  https://arxiv.org/abs/arXiv:1404.1927, "Generating X-ray lines from annihilating dark matter"&lt;/ref&gt; or a 7 keV dark matter particle decaying into a photon and a neutrino.&lt;ref name=sterile&gt;H.

The '''XENON''' [[dark matter]] research project, operated at the [[Italy|Italian]] [[Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso|Gran Sasso National Laboratory]], is a deep underground research facility featuring increasingly ambitious experiments aiming to detect [[dark matter]] particles. The experiments aim to detect particles in the form of [[weakly interacting massive particles]] (WIMPs) by looking for rare interactions via nuclear recoils in a liquid xenon target chamber. The current detector consists of a dual phase [[time projection chamber]] (TPC).

The experiment detects [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] and [[ionization]] produced when particles interact in the liquid xenon volume, to search for an excess of nuclear recoil events over known backgrounds. The detection of such a signal would provide the first direct experimental evidence for dark matter candidate particles. The collaboration is currently led by Italian professor of physics [[Elena Aprile]] from [[Columbia University]].

==Detector principle==
[[File:2phaseTPC b.jpg|thumbnail|Sketch of the working principle of a xenon dual-phase TPC]]
The XENON experiment operates a dual phase [[time projection chamber]] (TPC), which utilizes a liquid xenon target with a gaseous phase on top. Two arrays of [[photomultiplier]] tubes (PMTs), one at the top of the detector in the gaseous phase (GXe), and one at the bottom of the liquid layer (LXe), detect [[Scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] and [[electroluminescence]] light produced when charged particles interact in the detector. Electric fields are applied across both the liquid and gaseous phase of the detector. The electric field in the gaseous phase has to be sufficiently large to extract electrons from the liquid phase.

Particle interactions in the liquid target produce [[scintillation (physics)|scintillation]] and [[ionization]]. The prompt scintillation light produces 178&amp;nbsp;nm ultraviolet photons. This signal is detected by the PMTs, and is referred to as the S1 signal. This technique has proved sensitive enough to detect single photoelectrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aprile |first=E. |collaboration=XENON100 Collaboration |display-authors=etal |year=2014 |title=Observation and applications of single-electron charge signals in the XENON100 experiment |journal=[[Journal of Physics G]] |volume=41 |issue=3 |pages=035201 |arxiv=1311.1088 |bibcode=2014JPhG...41c5201A |doi=10.1088/0954-3899/41/3/035201}}&lt;/ref&gt; The applied electric field prevents recombination of all the electrons produced from a charged particle interaction in the TPC. These electrons are drifted to the top of the liquid phase by the electric field. The ionization is then extracted into the gas phase by the stronger electric field in the gaseous phase. The electric field accelerates the electrons to the point that it creates a proportional scintillation signal that is also collected by the PMTs, and is referred to as the S2 signal.

The detector allows for a full 3-D position determination&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aprile |first1=E. |collaboration=XENON100 Collaboration |display-authors=etal |year=2012 |title=The XENON100 dark matter experiment |journal=[[Astroparticle Physics]] |volume=35 |issue=9 |pages=573–590 |arxiv=1107.2155 |bibcode=2012APh....35..573X |doi=10.1016/j.astropartphys.2012.01.003|citeseerx=10.1.1.255.9957 }}&lt;/ref&gt; of the particle interaction. Electrons in liquid xenon have a uniform drift velocity. This allows the interaction depth of the event to be determined by measuring the time delay between the S1 and S2 signal. The position of the event in the x-y plane can be determined by looking at the number of photons seen by each of the individual PMTs. The full 3-D position allows for the [[fiducial (disambiguation)|fiducialization]] of the detector, in which a low-background region is defined in the inner volume of the TPC. This fiducial volume has a greatly reduced rate of background events as compared to regions of the detector at the edge of the TPC, due to the self-shielding properties of liquid xenon. This allows for a much higher sensitivity when searching for very rare events.

Charged particles moving through the detector are expected to either interact with the electrons of the xenon atoms producing electronic recoils, or with the nucleus, producing nuclear recoils. For a given amount of energy deposited by a particle interaction in the detector, the ratio of S2/S1 can be used as a discrimination parameter to distinguish electronic and nuclear recoil events.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aprile |first1=E. |display-authors=etal |year=2014 |title=Analysis of the XENON100 dark matter search data |journal=[[Astroparticle Physics]] |volume=54 |issue= |pages=11–24 |arxiv= 1207.3458|bibcode=2014APh....54...11A |doi=10.1016/j.astropartphys.2013.10.002}}&lt;/ref&gt; This ratio is expected to be greater for electronic recoils than for nuclear recoils. In this way backgrounds from electronic recoils can be suppressed by more than 99%, while simultaneously retaining 50% of the nuclear recoil events.

==XENON10==
[[File:ShieldandCryostatXENON100.jpg|thumb|200px|The cryostat and shield of XENON100. The shield consists of an outer layer of 20&amp;nbsp;cm of water, a 20&amp;nbsp;cm layer of lead, a 20&amp;nbsp;cm layer of polyethylene, and on the interior a 5&amp;nbsp;cm copper layer]]

The XENON10 experiment was installed at the underground [[Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso|Gran Sasso laboratory]] in [[Italy]] during March 2006. The underground location of the laboratory provides 3100&amp;nbsp;m of water-equivalent shielding. The detector was placed within a shield to further reduce the background rate in the TPC. XENON10 was intended as a prototype detector, to prove the efficacy of the XENON design, as well as verify the achievable threshold, background rejection power and sensitivity. The XENON10 detector contained 15&amp;nbsp;kg of liquid xenon. The sensitive volume of the TPC measures 20&amp;nbsp;cm in diameter and 15&amp;nbsp;cm in height.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aprile |first=E. |collaboration=XENON10 Collaboration |display-authors=etal |year=2011 |title=Design and Performance of The XENON10 Experiment |journal=[[Astroparticle Physics]] |volume=34 |issue=9 |pages=679–698 |arxiv=1001.2834 |bibcode=2011APh....34..679A |doi=10.1016/j.astropartphys.2011.01.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An analysis of 59 live days of data, taken between October 2006 and February 2007, produced no WIMP signatures. The number of events observed in the WIMP search region is statistically consistent with the expected number of events from electronic recoil backgrounds. This result excluded some of the available parameter space in [[Minimal Supersymmetric Standard Model|minimal Supersymmetric models]], by placing limits on spin independent WIMP-nucleon cross sections down to below {{val|10|e=-43|u=cm2}} for a {{val|30|u=GeV/c2}} WIMP mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Angle |first=J. |collaboration=XENON10 Collaboration |display-authors=etal |year=2008 |title=First Results from the XENON10 Dark Matter Experiment at the Gran Sasso National Laboratory |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=100 |issue=2 |pages=021303 |arxiv=0706.0039 |bibcode=2008PhRvL.100b1303A |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.100.021303 |pmid=18232850}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Due to nearly half of natural xenon having odd spin states (&lt;sup&gt;129&lt;/sup&gt;Xe has an abundance of 26% and spin-1/2; &lt;sup&gt;131&lt;/sup&gt;Xe has an abundance of 21% and spin-3/2), the XENON detectors can also be used to provide limits on spin dependent WIMP-nucleon cross sections for coupling of the dark matter candidate particle to both neutrons and protons. XENON10 set the world's most stringent restrictions on pure neutron coupling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Angle |first=J. |collaboration=XENON10 Collaboration |display-authors=etal |year=2008 |title=Limits on spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon cross-sections from the XENON10 experiment |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=101 |issue=9 |pages=091301 |arxiv=0805.2939 |bibcode=2008PhRvL.101i1301A |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.101.091301 |pmid=18851599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:BottomPMTArray.jpg|100px|thumb|200px|alt=Borrom PMT Array of XENON100|The bottom PMT array of XENON100 contains 80 PMTs which are spaced as closely as possible in order to maximize light collection efficiency.]]

The second phase detector, XENON100, contains 165&amp;nbsp;kg of liquid xenon, with 62&amp;nbsp;kg in the target region and the remaining xenon in an active veto. The TPC of the detector has a diameter of 30&amp;nbsp;cm and a height of 30&amp;nbsp;cm. As WIMP interactions are expected to be extremely rare events, a thorough campaign was launched during the construction and commissioning phase of XENON100 to screen all parts of the detector for radioactivity. The screening was performed using [[semiconductor detector#Germanium detectors|high-purity Germanium detectors]]. In a few cases [[mass spectrometry]] was performed on low mass plastic samples. In doing so the design goal of &lt;10&lt;sup&gt;−2&lt;/sup&gt; events/kg/day/keV &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aprile |first=E. |collaboration=XENON100 Collaboration |display-authors=etal |year=2011 |title=Material screening and selection for XENON100 |journal=[[Astroparticle Physics]] |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=43–49 |arxiv=1103.5831 |bibcode=2011APh....35...43A |doi=10.1016/j.astropartphys.2011.06.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; was reached, realising the world's lowest background rate dark matter detector.

The detector was installed at the [[Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso|Gran Sasso National Laboratory]] in 2008 in the same shield as the XENON10 detector, and has conducted several science runs. In each science run, no dark matter signal was observed above the expected background, leading to the most stringent limit on the spin independent WIMP-nucleon cross section in 2012, with a minimum at {{val|2.0|e=-45|u=cm2}} for a {{val|65|u=GeV/c2}} WIMP mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aprile |first=E. |collaboration=XENON100 Collaboration |display-authors=etal |year=2012 |title=Dark Matter Results from 225 Live Days of XENON100 Data |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=109 |issue=18 |page=181301 |arxiv=1207.5988 |bibcode=2012PhRvL.109r1301A |doi=10.1103/physrevlett.109.181301 |pmid=23215267}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results constrain interpretations of signals in other experiments as dark matter interactions, and rule out exotic models such as inelastic dark matter, which would resolve this discrepancy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aprile |first=E. |collaboration=XENON100 Collaboration |display-authors=etal |year=2011 |title=Implications on inelastic dark matter from 100 live days of XENON100 data |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=84 |issue=6 |pages= 061101|arxiv=1104.3121 |bibcode=2011PhRvD..84f1101A |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.84.061101}}&lt;/ref&gt; XENON100 has also provided improved limits on the spin dependent WIMP-nucleon cross section.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Aprile |first=E. |collaboration=XENON100 Collaboration |display-authors=etal |year=2012 |title=Limits on spin-dependent WIMP-nucleon cross sections from 225 live days of XENON100 data |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=111 |issue=2 |page=021301 |arxiv=1301.6620 |bibcode=2013PhRvL.111b1301A |doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.111.021301 |pmid=23889382}}&lt;/ref&gt; An [[axion]] result was published in 2014,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aprile |first=E. |collaboration=XENON1000 Collaboration |display-authors=etal |year=2014 |title=First Axion Results from the XENON100 Experiment |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=90 |issue=6 |page=062009 |bibcode=2014PhRvD..90f2009A |doi=10.1103/PhysRevD.90.062009|arxiv=1404.1455}}&lt;/ref&gt; setting a new best axion limit.

XENON100 operated the then-lowest background experiment, for dark matter searches, with a background of 50 mDRU (1 mDRU=10&lt;sup&gt;−3&lt;/sup&gt; events/kg/day/keV).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Aprile |first=E. |collaboration=XENON100 Collaboration |display-authors=etal |year=2011 |title=Study of the electromagnetic background in the XENON100 experiment |journal=[[Physical Review D]] |volume=83 |issue=8 |pages=082001 |arxiv=1101.3866 |bibcode=2011PhRvD..83h2001A |doi=10.1103/physrevd.83.082001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==XENON1T==

Construction of the next phase, XENON1T, started in Hall B of the [[Laboratori Nazionali del Gran Sasso|Gran Sasso National Laboratory]] in 2014. The detector contains 3.5 tons of ultra radio-pure liquid Xenon, and has a fiducial volume of about 2 tons. The detector is housed in a 10&amp;nbsp;m water tank that serves as a muon veto. The TPC is 1&amp;nbsp;m in diameter and 1&amp;nbsp;m in height. The predicted sensitivity at {{val|50|u=GeV/c2}} is {{val|2.0|e=-47|u=cm2}}.{{citation needed|date=August 2016}} This is 100x lower than the current limit published for XENON100.

It is expected to explore/test [[supersymmetry]] candidates such as [[CMSSM]].&lt;ref name=Roszkowski2014&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roszkowski |first1=L. |last2=Sessolo |first2=E.

===In the news===

The detector project team, called the XENON Collaboration, is composed of 135 investigators across 22 institutions from Europe, the Middle East, and the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xenon1t.org/ |title=Homepage of the XENON1T Dark Matter Search |website=www.xenon1t.org |access-date=2017-06-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:XENON1T.png|thumb|Upper limit for spin-independent WIMP-nucleon cross section according to recent data (published Nov. 2017)]]
The first results from XENON1T were released by the XENON collaboration on May 18, 2017, based on 34 days of data-taking between November 2016 and January 2017. While no WIMPs or dark matter candidate signals were officially detected, the team did announce a record low reduction in the background radioactivity levels being picked up by XENON1T. The exclusion limits exceeded the previous best limits set by the [[Large Underground Xenon experiment|LUX experiment]], with an exclusion of cross sections larger than {{val|7.7|e=-47|u=cm2}} for WIMP masses of {{val|35|u=GeV/c2}}.&lt;ref name="Xenon1TMay173"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Aprile|first1=E. |collaboration=XENON collaboration |display-authors=etal |year=2017 |title=First Dark Matter Search Results from the XENON1T Experiment |journal=[[Physical Review Letters]] |volume=119 |issue= 7679|pages=153–154 |arxiv=1705.06655 |bibcode=2017Natur.551..153G |doi=10.1038/551153a |pmid=29120431 |doi-access=free}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.space.com/36991-most-sensitive-dark-matter-detector-online.html |title=The World's Most Sensitive Dark Matter Detector Is Now Up and Running |date=May 24, 2017 |accessdate=May 25, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because some signals that the detector receives might be due to neutrons, reducing the radioactivity increases the sensitivity to [[weakly interacting massive particles|WIMPs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.uchicago.edu/article/2017/05/18/worlds-most-sensitive-dark-matter-detector-releases-first-results |title=World’s most sensitive dark matter detector releases first results |date=2017-05-18 |work=UChicago News |access-date=2017-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==XENONnT==
XENONnT is the next upgrade step with a total xenon mass of 8 tonnes. Apart from a larger volume the experiment will feature even lower background radiation levels. It is designed to reach a sensitivity where neutrinos become a significant background. Commissioning is expected to start in 2019.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://indico.cern.ch/event/686555/contributions/2971166/attachments/1682810/2704147/ICHEP2018_murra_v1.pdf|author=Michael Murra|accessdate=September 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
