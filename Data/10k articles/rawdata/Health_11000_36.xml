[[File:Europe population over 65.png|thumb|400px|Percentage of the population over 65 in Europe in 2010]]

The '''ageing of Europe''', also known as the '''greying of Europe''', is a demographic phenomenon in Europe characterised by a decrease in [[total fertility rate|fertility]], a decrease in [[mortality rate]], and a higher [[life expectancy]] among European populations.&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite web|author=Giuseppe Carone and Declan Costello|year=2006|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/fandd/2006/09/carone.htm|title=Can Europe Afford to Grow Old?|publisher=International Monetary Fund Finance and Development magazine|accessdate=15 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Low birth rates and higher life expectancy contribute to the transformation of Europe's [[population pyramid]] shape. The most significant change is the transition towards a much older population structure, resulting in a decrease in the proportion of the working age while the number of the retired population increases. The total number of the older population is projected to increase greatly within the coming decades, with rising proportions of the post-war baby-boom generations reaching retirement. This will cause a high burden on the working age population as they provide for the increasing number of the older population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/eurostat/statistics-explained/index.php/Population_structure_and_ageing|title=Population structure and ageing - Statistics Explained|website=Ec.europa.eu|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout history many states have worked to keep high birth rates in order to have moderate taxes, more economic activity and more troops for their military.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/europes-shrinking-aging-population|title=Europe's Shrinking, Aging Population|last=|first=|date=June 13, 2012|website=Stratfor.com|language=en|access-date=2017-03-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overall trends==
{{Main|Historical demography#Historical population of the world|l1=Historical population of the world}}
Giuseppe Carone and Declan Costello of the [[International Monetary Fund]] projected in September 2006 that the ratio of retirees to workers in Europe will double to 0.54 by 2050 (from four workers per retiree to two workers per retiree).&lt;ref name=a/&gt;&lt;ref name=c&gt;{{cite web|url=http://goldsea.com/Asiagate/607/17europe.html|title=Europe's Aging Population Faces Social Problems Similar to Japan's|publisher=Goldsea Asian American Daily|accessdate=15 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; William H. Frey, an analyst for the [[Brookings Institution]] [[think tank]], predicts the [[Population pyramid|median age]] in Europe will increase from 37.7 years old in 2003 to 52.3 years old by 2050 while the median age of Americans will rise to only 35.4 years old.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

[[Máire Geoghegan-Quinn]], the former [[European Commissioner for Research, Innovation and Science]], stated that by 2020 a quarter of the population of Europe will be 60 years or older. This shift in demographics will drastically change the economic, labor market, health care, and social security of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;European Commission (2014). [https://ec.europa.eu/research/social-sciences/pdf/policy_reviews/kina26426enc.pdf "Population Aging in Europe: Facts, Implications, and Policies."]. Retrieved 1 May 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[OECD|Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development]] estimates 39% of Europeans between the ages of 55 to 65 work. If Frey's prediction for Europe's rising median age is correct, Europe's economic output could radically decrease over the next four decades.&lt;ref name=b&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Bernstein|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/29/international/europe/29AGIN.html?ex=1372219200&amp;en=48abc5aeb06b894c&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308030015/http://www.nytimes.com/2003/06/29/international/europe/29AGIN.html?ex=1372219200&amp;en=48abc5aeb06b894c&amp;ei=5007&amp;partner=USERLAND|dead-url=yes|archive-date=8 March 2008|title=Aging Europe Finds Its Pension Is Running Out|work=The New York Times|accessdate=15 December 2007 | date=29 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Austria's Social Affairs Minister said in 2006 that, by 2010, the 55- to 64-year-old age bracket in the [[European Union]] would be larger than the 15- to 24-year-old bracket. The Economic Policy Committee and the European Commission issued a report in 2006 estimating the working age population in the EU will decrease by 48 million, a 16% reduction, between 2010 and 2050, while the elderly population will increase by 58 million, a gain of 77%.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The [[United States Census Bureau|U.S. Census Bureau]] estimates the [[European Union]] will experience a 14% decrease in its workforce and a 7% decrease in its consumer populations by 2030.&lt;ref name=d&gt;{{cite web|author=Paul S.

The feminisation of an old age is reflected by an increasing number of females age 65 and older. The longer life span is prevalent amongst women across the world.&lt;ref name="1944- 2012"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/697596943|title=Population : an introduction to concepts and issues|last=Weeks|first=John Robert|date=2012|publisher=Wadsworth Cengage learning|isbn=9781111185978|edition=11th|location=Belmont, CA|oclc=697596943}}&lt;/ref&gt; In Europe the life expectancy for women is 81 years old, while men's life expectancy is only 74 years old, which gives 7 years' difference.&lt;ref name=":04"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/|title=World Population Ageing 2017|website=United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2017)|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Life expectancy at age 60 is four years longer for women in comparison to men.

==Causes==
{{Multiple issues|section=yes|

}}
{{main|Population ageing}}Population ageing in Europe is caused primarily by three factors: declining [[Total fertility rate|fertility rates]], increased life expectancy and migration.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.un.org/en/development/desa/population/publications/|title=World Population Ageing 2017|website=United Nations, Department of Economic and Social Affairs, Population Division (2017)|accessdate=26 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The causes of population ageing vary among countries.

=== Fertility ===
[[File:Trends_in_Total_Fertility_1950-2010.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Trends_in_Total_Fertility_1950-2010.png|thumb|Trends in Total Fertility 1950–2010]]The high number of people aged 60 and older in Europe is the result of high fertility rates, which occurred in years 1950–1960.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The period after the end of the World War II, which was characterised by good social and economic status of the population in the child-bearing age and resulted in a "baby boom".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Artzrouni|first1=M|last2=Easterlin|first2=R|date=1982|title=Birth History, Age Structure, and Post World War II Fertility in Ten Developed Countries: An Exploratory Empirical Analysis|journal=Genus|volume=38|pages=81–99}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Current low fertility levels also contribute to the ageing of Europe.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; As the fertility levels drop, the age structure of the population changes, and the number of the younger groups decrease in relation to the older age groups.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Europe's fertility rates have been less than the 2.1 children per woman (standard) replacement level and are projected to remain below the replacement level in the future.&lt;ref name="stratfor.com22"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.stratfor.com/analysis/europes-shrinking-aging-population|title=Europe's Shrinking, Aging Population|website=Stratfor.com|accessdate=28 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Mortality ===
People are living longer with projections of average [[life expectancy]] reaching 84.6 years for men and 89.1 for women by 2060, an increase of 7.9 years of life for men and 6.6 years of life for women compared to 2010.&lt;ref name="stratfor.com22"/&gt; The longer life span results in the changing age structure in the population by increasing the numbers of people in the older age group.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The average life expectancy of the older population will depend on the progress in medicine to prevent the diseases, which are leading causes of death.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Among top three causes of death are [[Coronary artery disease|ischemic artery disease]], [[stroke]] and [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Migration ===
People [[Immigration|immigrating]] and [[Emigration|emigrating]] from the country will cause fluctuations, in particular, in the size of the working age group of the population.&lt;ref name="1944- 2012"/&gt; If there are high numbers of young immigrants coming to the country it will result in decrease of the proportion of the ageing population.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In following countries the immigration is projected to slow the population ageing: Luxembourg, Switzerland, Norway, Germany, Sweden, Finland, Belgium, Denmark, Austria and United Kingdom.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Emigration, would make the opposite effect on population aging by having the people in the working age leaving the country, and accelerating the aging of population as the result.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Increase of the aging population caused by emigration is projected to occur in Latvia.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Effects==
{{Main|Opposition to immigration}}
There have been mixed feelings over the European population's increased life expectancy and declining birth rate ever since the European countries were the first to start the [[demographic transition]] between the 18th and 19th centuries, and perhaps even more since this was achieved. Demographic studies and resultant reports conducted by the [[European Commission]]&lt;ref&gt;Eurostat, ''Population Projections'', European Commission, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; point to the declining [[birth rate]] of the population of the native European peoples, which would need to be reversed from its present level of about 1.4 in order to preclude a population decline of the native European peoples by nearly half in each [[generation]], back to a replacement level of 2.1. Some have claimed that in order to compensate, it is necessary to allow migrants to settle in Europe in order to prevent labour [[shortage]]s. It has been argued that such immigration leads to [[ethnic conflict]]s, such as the [[2005 French riots|2005 civil unrest in France]].&lt;ref&gt;Steyn, Mark (2006) ''America Alone: The End of the World As We Know It'' Washington D.C., Regnery Publishing. On pages 10 and 54, birth rates among people of European ancestry populations in various nations are indicated that show all populations of European ancestry are reproducing at an average birth rate of only about 1.4, almost half the replacement rate of 2.1, and thus their population has a negative (declining) growth rate that will decline by almost half every generation.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes.com2"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/29/magazine/29Birth-t.html?fta=y "Childless Europe: What Happens to a Continent When it Stops Making Babies?"] ''New York Times Magazine'' Sunday, June 29, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Himmelfarb, Milton, and Victor Baras (eds). 1978. Zero Population Growth-For Whom?: differential fertility and minority group survival. Westport, CT: Praeger; Leuprecht, C. 2011. "'Deter or Engage?:Demographic Determinants of Bargains in Ethno-Nationalist Conflicts'." in [http://www.paradigmpublishers.com/books/BookDetail.aspx?productID=280257 Political Demography: identity, conflict and institutions ed. J. A. Goldstone, E. Kaufmann and M. Toft. Boulder, CO: Paradigm Press]&lt;/ref&gt;

Long-term decreasing rates in fertility and increasing life expectancy could have damaging consequences for almost every European nation. One consequence of ageing might be lower inflation rates as elderly people are more inflation averse and have sufficient political power for governments to care about their preferences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vlandas|first1=T|title=Grey power and the economy: Ageing and inflation across advanced economies|journal=Comparative Political Studies |date=2017|doi=10.1177/0010414017710261}}&lt;/ref&gt; These demographic trends provoked debate over the best policies that can reverse these trends and lessen their consequences. RAND Europe, an independent not-for-profit research institute, was able to collect these policies through research and analysis. There were three broad policy approaches that were generated from the debate. The first policy is to encourage childbearing among younger couples that involves marriage and cohabitation. The second policy states that there should be an increase in the immigration of working-age people. Thirdly, there should be an improvement of social policy in general, to mitigate negative consequences of these trends. The research intends to examine the relationship between demographic trends and European government policies and determine which policies can reduce the consequences of low fertility and population ageing.&lt;ref name="Low Fertility and Population Ageing"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Grant|first=Jonathan|date=2004-01-01|title=Low Fertility and Population Ageing |url=http://www.rand.org/pubs/monographs/MG206.html|journal=|volume=|pages=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Countries==
=== Belgium ===
{{Main|Demographics of Belgium}}
The [[International Monetary Fund]]'s (IMF) High Council of Finance's (HCF) Study Committee on Aging (SCA) predicted in 2007 that Belgium's population will increase by 5% by 2050 due to immigration, a higher fertility rate, and longer life expectancy. However, the IMF's study indicates Belgium's elderly population will increase by over 63% to over 25% of the country's overall population.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}[[File:Population_pyramid_of_Belgium_2016.png|link=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/File:Population_pyramid_of_Belgium_2016.png|thumb|Population pyramid of Belgium 2016]]The Belgian government spent 9.1% of its GDP on pensions and 7.1% on health care expenses in 2005. By 2050 total social spending is expected to increase by 5.8%, assuming there is no change in the age of retirement. Most of this higher social spending comes from pension and health care, rising by 3.9% to 13.0% of GDP and 3.7% to 10.8% of GDP, respectively.{{Citation needed|date=October 2011}}

The decline in the workforce will partly compensate by lowering unemployment which will in turn lower the cost of childcare.&lt;ref name="j"&gt;{{cite web|author=Rodolfo Luzio and Jianping Zhou|year=2007|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/scr/2007/cr0788.pdf|title=March 2007, IMF Country Report No. 07/88, Belgium: Selected Issues|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=15 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The IMF also predicts that by 2050 the percentage of Belgian population over the age of 65 will increase from 16% to 25%.&lt;ref name="k"&gt;{{cite web|author=Rudolf Luzio|year=2007|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/survey/so/2007/CAR0531A.htm|title=Belgium: Time to Shift to Higher Gear|publisher=International Monetary Fund|accessdate=15 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The population of the Russian Federation declined from its peak of 148,689,000 in 1991, to about 143 million people in 2013, a 4% decline. The World Bank predicted in 2005 that the population was set to decrease to 111 million by 2050, a 22% decline, if trends did not improve.&lt;ref name=s/&gt; The United Nations similarly warned that the population could decline by one third by mid-century.&lt;ref name=t&gt;{{cite news|author=Steven Eke|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4125072.stm|title=Russia's population falling fast|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=22 December 2007 | date=23 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2006 a national programme was developed with a goal to reverse the decline by 2020. A study published shortly after in 2007 showed that the rate of population decrease had slowed: According to the study, deaths exceeded births by 1.3 times, down from 1.5 times in the previous year, thus, if the net decrease in January–August 2006 was 408,200 people, in the same period during 2007 it was 196,600. The decline continued to slow in 2008 with only half the population loss compared to 2007. The reversal continued at the same pace in 2009 as death rates continued to fall, birth rates continued to rise and net migration stayed steady at about 250,000; in 2009 Russia saw population growth for the first time in 15 years.&lt;ref name="bbc1"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/8468185.stm Russia sees first population increase in 15 years] [[BBC]] Retrieved on 18 February 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gks2009"&gt;[http://www.gks.ru/bgd/free/b10_00/IssWWW.exe/Stg/d01/7-0.htm 2009 demographic figures] [[Goskomstat|Rosstat]] Retrieved on 18 February 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Populationgrowth.png|thumb|right|500px|The trend in the number of births and deaths 1992–2010]]
The improving economy has had a positive impact on the country's low birth-rate, as it rose from its lowest point of 8.27 births per 1000 people in 1999 to 11.28 per 1,000 in 2007. Russian Ministry of Economic Development hopes that by 2020 the population will stabilise at 138–139 million, and that by 2025 it will begin to increase again to its present-day status of 142–145, also raising the life expectancy to 75 years.&lt;ref&gt;Newsru, ''Население России за пять лет уменьшилось на 3,2 миллиона до 142 миллионов человек'', 19.Oct.2007 [http://www.newsru.com/russia/19oct2007/uzhe142.html Retrieved] same date&lt;/ref&gt;

The two leading [[List of causes of death by rate|causes of death]] in Russia are [[Cardiovascular disease|heart disease]] and stroke, accounting for about 52% of all deaths.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.who.int/whosis/mort/profiles/mort_euro_rus_russianfed.pdf Mortality Country Fact Sheet 2006] [[WHO]] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080313110138/http://www.who.int/whosis/mort/profiles/mort_euro_rus_russianfed.pdf |date=13 March 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; While [[cardiovascular disease]]-related deaths decreased in Japan, North America, and Western Europe between 1965 and 2001, in Russia CVD deaths increased by 25% for women and 65% for men.

The percentage of [[Infertility|infertile]], married couples rose to 13% in the first decade of the 21st century, partially due to poorly performed abortions. According to expert Murray Feshbach 10–20% of women who have abortions in Russia are made infertile, though according to the 2002 census, only about 6–7% of women have not had children by the end of their reproductive years.&lt;ref name=w&gt;{{cite news|author=Nicholas Eberstadt|year=2004|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/ac2/wp-dyn/A38176-2004Feb12?language=printer|title=The Emptying of Russia|work=The Washington Post|accessdate=22 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://web.worldbank.org/WBSITE/EXTERNAL/DATASTATISTICS/0,,contentMDK:20541648~isCURL:Y~menuPK:1192714~pagePK:64133150~piPK:64133175~theSitePK:239419,00.html World Bank report on Russia's demography] World Bank Retrieved on 3 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Provincial governments have begun offering special incentives to couples who procreate. In 2005 Sergei Morozov, the Governor of [[Ulyanovsk Oblast]], made 12 September a provincial holiday, the "[[Day of Conception]]," on which couples are given half of the work day off to copulate.

Mothers who give birth on 12 June, Russia's national day, are rewarded with money and expensive consumer items. In the first round of the competition 311 women participated and 46 babies were born on the following 12 June. Over 500 women participated in the second round in 2006 and 78 gave birth. The province's birth rate rose 4.5% between 2006 and 2007.&lt;ref name=u&gt;{{cite news|author=Masha Stromova|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/09/12/world/main3253182.shtml|title=Have Sex, Make A Baby, Win A Car?|publisher=CBS News|accessdate=22 December 2007 | date=12 September 2007| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20071230073425/http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2007/09/12/world/main3253182.shtml| archivedate= 30 December 2007 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Large-scale immigration is suggested as a solution to declining workforces in western nations, but according to the [[BBC]], would be unacceptable to most Russians. Organisations like the [[World Health Organization]] and the UN have called on the Russian government to take the problem more seriously, stressing that a number of simple measures such as raising the price of alcohol or forcing people to wear [[seat belt]]s might make a lasting difference.&lt;ref name=t/&gt;

Then-[[President of Russia|President]] [[Vladimir Putin]] said in a state of the nation address that "no sort of immigration will solve Russia's demographic problem". Yevgeny Krasinyev, head of migration studies at the state-run Institute of Social and Economic Population Studies in Moscow, said Russia should only accept immigrants from the [[Commonwealth of Independent States]], a view echoed by Alexander Belyakov, the head of the [[Duma]]'s Resources Committee.

[[Human migration|Migration]] in Russia grew by 50.2% in 2007, and an additional 2.7% in 2008, helping stem the population decline. Migrants to Russia primarily come from CIS states and are Russians or Russian speakers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gks.ru/bgd/free/b08_00/IssWWW.exe/Stg/d01/7-0.htm Демография] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080225172120/http://www.gks.ru/bgd/free/b08_00/IssWWW.exe/Stg/d01/7-0.htm |date=25 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Thousands of migrant workers from Ukraine, Moldova, and the rest of the CIS have also entered Russia illegally, working but avoiding taxes.&lt;ref name=v&gt;{{cite web|author=Fred Weir|year=2002|url=http://www.csmonitor.com/2002/0418/p06s02-woeu.html|title=Russia's population decline spells trouble|publisher=The Christian Science Monitor|accessdate=22 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are an estimated 10 million illegal immigrants from the [[Republics of the Soviet Union|ex-Soviet]] states in Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Russia cracking down on illegal migrants|work=International Herald Tribune|date=15 January 2007|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2007/01/15/news/migrate.php}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Only AID volunteers are eligible to become Jeevansathis. Currently AID has seven Jeevansaathis.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| url= http://aidindia.org/main/content/section/15/399/| title= AID - Jeevansaathis| publisher= Association for India's Development| accessdate= 2010-06-03| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20100605085605/http://aidindia.org/main/content/section/15/399/| archivedate= 2010-06-05| deadurl= yes| df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5335">''Briganti'' is the Proto-Celtic term for ''Brighid'', or ''Brigid''.  The name ''*Brigantī'' means "The High One", cognate with the name of the [[Celtic Britons|ancient British]] goddess [[Brigantia (goddess)]], the [[Old High German]] personal name ''Burgunt,'' and the [[Sanskrit]] word ''Bṛhatī'' (बृहती) "high", an epithet of the [[Hindu]] dawn goddess [[Ushas]]. The ultimate source is [[Proto-Indo-European]] ''*bʰr̥ǵʰéntih₂'' (feminine form of ''*bʰérǵʰonts'', “high”), derived from the root ''*bʰerǵʰ-'' (“to rise”).&lt;ref&gt;Matasović, Ranko, Etymological Dictionary of Proto-Celtic (Leiden Indo-European Etymological Dictionary Series no. 9), Brill, 2009, pp. 78-79&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Mallory, J. P. and Adams, Douglas Q. (eds.), Encyclopedia of Indo-European Culture, Taylor &amp; Francis, 1997, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''British Retail Consortium''' (or '''BRC''') is a [[trade association]] in the [[United Kingdom]].  .

==History==
The British Retail Consortium was formed in January 1992 when the British Retailers' Association and the Retail Consortium merged. In 1998 it produced the first edition of the BRC Food Technical Standard and Protocol for food suppliers. This has been widely adopted not just throughout the UK but around the world.

==Functions==
It campaigns for the retail industry and is the authoritative voice of retail, recognized for its powerful campaigning and influence within government and as a provider of in-depth retail information. The BRC leads the industry and works with their members to tell the story of retail, shape debates and influence issues and opportunities which will help make that positive difference. Their work represents the careers of people who work in the industry, the communities retail touches and competitiveness as a fundamental principle of the industry’s success

Simmonds}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total collective dose is the dose to the exposed human population between the time of release until its elimination from the environment, perhaps integrating to time equals infinity. However, doses are generally reported for specific populations and a stated time interval. The [[International Commission on Radiological Protection]] (ICRP) states:"To avoid aggregation of low individual doses over extended time periods and wide geographical regions the range in effective dose and the time period should be limited and specified.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 paragraph B238&lt;/ref&gt;

==Limitations==
The ICRP states; "Collective effective dose is an instrument for optimisation, for comparing radiological technologies and protection procedures. Collective effective dose is not intended as a tool for epidemiological studies, and it is inappropriate to use it in risk projections. This is because the assumptions implicit in the calculation of collective effective dose (e.g., when applying the LNT model) conceal large biological and statistical uncertainties. Specifically, the computation of cancer deaths based on collective effective doses involving trivial exposures to large populations is not reasonable and should be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 paragraph 161&lt;/ref&gt;

All calculations that involve adding doses assume the [[Linear no-threshold model]] for health effects.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 paragraph 160&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly the collective dose will not give a good indication of health consequences where the doses to some individuals are large enough to cause to [[Ionizing radiation#Biological effects|deterministic]] effects.
The cancer risk due to a unit dose of radiation depends on the age and [[Radiation-induced cancer#Epidemiology|other characteristics]] of the population. Small local populations, for example radiation workers, may not have a typical population profile.

Releases of [[radioisotopes]] can expose future generations to ionizing radiation and the calculation of the collective dose from such releases will contain [[Measurement uncertainty|uncertainties]]. For example, it is impossible to be sure of future population sizes and habits (e.g. diet and agricultural practices). Also the effects of a given radiation dose in the future may be greater (longer life expectancies) or less (improvements in cancer treatment) than for current exposures.

When calculating the total collective dose due to a release of long-lived radionuclides (e.g. [[Carbon-14]]) it is necessary to make assumptions about the habits and population sizes of future generations, and sometimes it is assumed that population sizes and behaviour remain the same for all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Smith|first=J.G.|title=The methodology for assessing the radiological consequences of routine releases of radionuclides to the environment used in PC-CREAM 08|year=2009|publisher=Health Protection Agency|location=Didcot|isbn=978-0-85951-651-8|pages=10|url=http://www.hpa.org.uk/Publications/Radiation/HPARPDSeriesReports/HPARPD058/|author2=(editors), J.R. Simmonds}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dose units==
The SI unit for Collective dose, S, is man-[[sievert]]s.&lt;ref&gt;ICRP publication 103 paragraph 160&lt;/ref&gt;  The person-[[Röntgen equivalent man|rem]] is sometimes used as the non SI unit in some regulatory systems.

==Examples==
Atmospheric [[Nuclear weapons testing|nuclear weapons]] tests in isolated areas often resulted in doses of less than 1 mSv to any individual. All the thousands of atmospheric tests that occurred in the 20th century together now cause a 30,000 man-Sv collective dose each year from [[Nuclear fallout|fallout]]. The annual dose reduces each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Radiation, People and the Environment|url=http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Booklets/RadPeopleEnv/radiation_booklet.html|work=Topical Booklets &amp; Overviews|publisher=International Atomic Energy Agency|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{History of the Philippines}}

'''Dentistry in the Philippines''' can be divided into five periods of [[dental practice]]. Using the timeline of [[Philippine history]] as a template, they are: the Pre-Spanish era (from the Prehistoric period to the Classical period), the Spanish era, the American era, the Japanese-occupation era (during [[World War II]]) and the independent Philippine-Republics era.

==Pre-Spanish era (before 900 to 1521)==
===Barber-dentists===
The practice of extracting teeth has been practiced in the Philippines before the islands became a colony of Spain.&lt;ref name=DCP&gt;{{cite web|title=Taking A Look Back To The History Of Dental Practice In The Philippines|url=http://www.dentalclinicphilippines.com/news/taking-a-look-back-to-the-history-of-dental-practice-in-the-philippines/|publisher=Dental Clinic Philippines (2012)|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the early Filipino to act as "dental practitioners" and "curers of toothaches" were [[Barber surgeon|barber]]s. Their crude and "queer methods" pulling out teeth from patients involved the use of fingers and [[nail-plier]]s.&lt;ref name=PDA&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Philippine Dentistry|url=http://www.philippinedentalassociation.co/pda/history/|publisher=Philippine Dental Association (PDA)|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spanish era (1521 to 1898)==
===Tooth-pullers===
During the Spanish regime in the Philippines, dentistry was not recognized as a profession.&lt;ref name=DCP/&gt; There were no royal decrees and laws from the Spanish government to govern and guide the practice of dentists. A professional regulating body was also non-existent to oversee the field of dental practice during that time period.&lt;ref name=PRC&gt;{{cite web|title=History, Board of Dentistry|url=http://www.prc.gov.ph/prb/default.aspx?id=11&amp;content=65|publisher=Professional Regulation Commission|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, dentists were known as ''sacamuelas'' (plural of ''sacamuela'' meaning "tooth-puller"). Any person of the time period who were skillful in pulling teeth could become a sacamuela.&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt;

===First true dentists===
The first dentist in Spanish Philippines to open a dental clinic to practice true dentistry was José "Capitan Cheng-cheng" Arevalo.&lt;ref name=DCP/&gt; Arevalo was the first Filipino dentist.&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt; Arevalo was assisted by his wife who was skilled in "gold craftsmanship".&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt; Arevalo's clinic was in Quiapo, Manila. Arevalo later became a partner of Monsiuer M. Fertri, a dentist from France, who opened another dental clinic in Quiapo, Manila&lt;ref name=DCP&gt;{{cite web|title=Taking A Look Back To The History Of Dental Practice In The Philippines|url=http://www.dentalclinicphilippines.com/news/taking-a-look-back-to-the-history-of-dental-practice-in-the-philippines/|publisher=Dental Clinic Philippines (2012)|accessdate=1 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; in 1858, after residing in Hong Kong.&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt; Fertri needed Arevalo's expertise as a [[prosthetist]].&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt;  

The development of dentistry as a profession started when the University of Santo Tomas offered a special course with a basic curriculum&lt;ref name=DCP/&gt; to train ''cirujano ministrantes''&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt; (plural of ''cirujano ministrante'', literally meaning "one who administers surgery"). Their name was later changed to ''cirujano dentistas'' (plural of ''cirujano dentista'' meaning "dentist-surgeon" or "dental surgeon").&lt;ref name=DCP/&gt;

==American era (1898 to 1946)==
===American-era Board of Dental Examiners===
During the American administration of the Philippines, examinations and licensing of dentists were introduced in the islands.&lt;ref name=PRC/&gt; Major General Elwell Otis, the Military Governor of the Philippines at the time, instructed the US Provost Marshal General to assess the skills of the dentists who already practicing their craft in the islands.&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt; On August 2, 1899, the US Provost Marshal General established the Board of Dental Examiners.&lt;ref name=PRC/&gt;&lt;ref name=DCP/&gt; Examinations were held and licenses to practice were issued.&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt;

In 1903, Act No. 593 known as "The Act of Regulating the Practice of Dentistry in the Philippine Islands" was passed to regulate the practice of dentistry in the Philippines.&lt;ref name=PRC/&gt;&lt;ref name=DCP/&gt; Through this Act, the Board of Dental Examiners was reorganized on January 10, 1903.&lt;ref name=PRC/&gt;&lt;ref name=DCP/&gt; The members of the Board of Dental Examiners were appointed by the Commissioner of Public Health after obtaining approval from the Board of Health of the Philippine Islands. The members were two Americans (Dr. Robert Oliver and Dr. Wallace G. Skidmore) and one Filipino (Dr. Antonio Vergel de Dios),&lt;ref name=PRC/&gt; with Oliver as the chairman while Skidmore as the secretary treasurer.&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt;

===Schools of dentistry===
Some Filipinos who practiced dentistry in the Philippines at the time were graduates of schools of dentistry in the United States.&lt;ref name=DCP/&gt; Among them were Dr. Gregorio R. Mateo, Dr. Francisco Ponce, Dr. Placido Flores and Dr. Joaquin A. Lada.&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt;

The Sociedad dental de Filipinas, an organization of dentists in the Philippines founded in February 1908, initiated the establishment of dental schools in the Philippines and vied for the improvement of the profession in the islands.&lt;ref name=DCP/&gt;&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt; It was located in the corner of [[Escolta Street|Escolta]] and Soda Streets.&lt;ref&gt;''Dental Profession in the Philippines'' historical marker by the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines|National Historical Institute]], installed 1961&lt;/ref&gt; The first school of dentistry in the Philippines -The year 1913 marked the beginning of the De Ocampo Memorial College. It was then named Philippine Dental College- the first Dental College recognized by the Philippine government and authorized to confer the degree of Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) in March 25, 1916 and Doctor of Dental Medicine (DDM) in December 19, 1932. the Colegio Dental del Liceo de Manila - was founded in 1913 offering and granting degrees of Doctor of Dental Surgery (DDS) and Doctor of Dental Medicine (DDM).&lt;ref name=DCP/&gt;&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt; The Colegio Dental del Liceo de Manila was later renamed in 1914 as the Philippine Dental College.&lt;ref name=DCP/&gt;&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt; Afterwards, other universities and colleges also opened their own schools of dentistry. Among them were the University of the Philippines in 1915, the National University in 1922, the Centro Escolar University in 1925, and the Manila College of Dentistry in 1929.&lt;ref name=DCP/&gt; The teachers in these schools were US Army dental officers. Among them were Col. George G. Graham who taught [[periodontology]], Major Harry Smalley who taught a course in prosthesis, and Major Thomas Page who taught operative dentistry.&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt;

===Regulatory amendments===

On February 5, 1915, the regulations concerning the holding of dental examinations and dental practice were amended by the Philippine Legislature through Act No. 2462. After the enactment of Act No. 2462, the appointment of the members of the Board of Dental Examiners were relegated to the Director of Health and is to be approved by the Secretary of the Interior.&lt;ref name=PRC/&gt; Act No. 2462 was further amended through Act No. 2602. The amendments in Act No. 2602 were related to the qualification, appointment, and removal of the members of the Board of Dental Examiners and the qualifications of candidates for dental board licensure examinations. Further changes were made through Act No. 3680 and 3681, in relation to reciprocity and removal of age requirement respectively for taking the dental licensure tests.&lt;ref name=PRC/&gt; 

In 1932, the Board of Dental Examiners was placed under the administration of the Department of Public Instruction upon the enactment of Public Act No. 4007 (the Reorganization Law of 1932).&lt;ref name=PRC/&gt;

According to [https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452301118300178 Dalanon and Matsuka], Southwestern Colleges in Cebu City, which is now known as [[Southwestern University Phinma|Southwestern University PHINMA]] was the first dental school outside of Manila. This was followed by the creation of Iloilo City Colleges and the University of San Agustin, which are both located in Iloilo City. Before World War II, the Philippines (10) had the most number of dental schools in Asia, more than India (7), Japan (7), Indonesia (3), Pakistan (2), Thailand (1) and Korea (1).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2018-07-07|title=The Evolution of Dental Education in the Philippines|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2452301118300178|journal=Health Professions Education|language=en|doi=10.1016/j.hpe.2018.07.001|issn=2452-3011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Japanese-occupation era (1942 to 1945)==
During World War II, the Philippines was occupied by the soldiers of the Japanese Empire from 1942 to 1945. Only a few number of dentists in the Philippines practiced their profession during the war and the occupation, often using resourcefulness due to insufficient availability of dental supplies. Ten years before the war, there was a steady supply of dental materials and equipment from the United States. Curricula for schools, including those that are for dental schools, were modified by the Japanese occupiers according to their military propaganda. After the war, dentists in the Philippines who survived the occupation returned to practicing their profession.&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt;

==Independent Philippine-Republics era (1946 to present)==

===Independent Philippine-Republics era Board of Dental Examiners===
In 1948, the Board of Dental Examiners became an independent regulatory body due to Philippine Republic Act No. 546. The first members of that independent board appointed by the Secretary of Health was composed of Dr. Gervasio Erana, Dr. Germanico Carreon, and [[Diosdado Carpio]], with Erana as the chairman of the board. The board was later given the "authority to issue, suspend or revoke certificates of registration and the power to administer oaths and oversee dental education requirements" after the enactment of The Philippine Dental Act of 1965 (Republic Act No. 4419).&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt;

===New dental schools===
Four new schools of dentistry were established in 1948. In Luzon, the Philippine College of Dental Medicine was founded, later to be renamed as the College of Dentistry of the University of the East. In the same year, three dental schools were established in the Visayas region. Among them were the at the Southwestern Colleges, at the Iloilo City Colleges and at the University of San Agustin.&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt;

===Population of dentists===
At one point in time, the [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) reported that there were about 43,220 dentists in the Philippines, meaning that there was one dentist responsible for the oral health of 22,300 students.&lt;ref name=DCP/&gt;

==Other notable Filipino dentists==
There were Filipino dentists who excelled in the field of dentistry during the Philippine-Republics era: among them were Dr. Victorino G. Villa and Dr. Luz C. Macapanpan. Villa became the Dean of the College of Dentistry of the University of the Philippines. Villa wrote an article about detino-enamel and other research papers that were published in the United States. On the other hand, Macapanpan focused her research regarding dental histology.&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt; Nieva Basa Eraña-Velázquez was the first Filipino woman dentist.&lt;!---from Association of Philippine Orthodontists article---&gt;

==Military dentists==
Philippine Republic Act No. 481 created the Dental Corps of the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines]], making it a technical service separate from the military's Medical Service. This law was sponsored by congressman and dental physician Ricardo Y. Ladrido.&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt;

==Dental associations==
After the founding of the Sociedad dental de Filipinas in 1908, another organization known as the National Dental Association was established in 1924.&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt; After World War II and the Japanese military occupation of the Philippines, on August 12, 1945, these two organizations joined to form the [[Philippine Dental Association]] (PDA). The PDA was inaugurated on September 7, 1945.&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Philippine Dental Association]]'' historical marker by the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines|National Historical Institute]], installed 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In some sources, the founding year of the Philippine Dental Association is attributed to the year 1908, the year when the Sociedad dental de Filipinas was established.&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt;

==Dental publications==
Among the official dentistry organs published in the Philippines during the American era was the ''Odontologia Filipina'' of the Colegio Dental del Liceo de Manila (Philippine Dental College). Its editor was Gregrorio Agramon.&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt; In 1924, ''The National Dental Review'' was published by the National Dental Association under the editorship of Dr. Eladio Aldecoa.&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt; After the union of the Sociedad dental de Filipinas and the National Dental Association after World War II to form the Philippine Dental Association, the Philippine Dental Association published its first issue of its official publication known as ''Journal of the Philippine Dental Association'' in January 1948.&lt;ref name=PDA/&gt;

== Marker from the National Historical Commission of the Philippines ==
[[File:PDA marker, Makati 2.jpg|left|thumb|Historical marker.]]
In recognition of its place in Philippine history and society, a [[Historical markers of the Philippines|historical marker]] was installed by the [[National Historical Commission of the Philippines]] for the dentistry profession. The marker entitled '''Dental Profession in the Philippines''' was installed in 1961 at the Philippine Dental Association building, Ayala Avenue, Makati City.

The '''Drug Effectiveness Review Project''' (DERP) is an [[Oregon]]-based collaboration of public and private organizations, including fifteen states, that have joined together to provide systematic evidence-based reviews of the comparative effectiveness and safety of [[Medication|drugs]] in many widely used drug classes and to apply the findings to inform public policy and related activities. It is managed at [[Oregon Health &amp; Science University]]. 

The purpose of the DERP reports is to make available information regarding the comparative effectiveness and safety profiles of different drugs within pharmaceutical classes.

DERP reports are not usage guidelines, nor should they be read as an endorsement of or recommendation for any particular drug, use or approach. Oregon Health &amp; Science University does not recommend or endorse any guideline or recommendation developed by users of these reports.

==The EB-eye – the EBI Search engine for biological data==
The [[European Bioinformatics Institute]] is a non-profit academic organisation that forms part of the European Molecular Biology Laboratory ([https://www.embl.org EMBL]). 
The [[European Bioinformatics Institute|EBI]] is a centre for research and services in bioinformatics. The Institute manages databases of biological data including nucleotide sequences, protein sequences and macromolecular structures.

=== The Mission of the EBI ===
*  To provide freely available data and bioinformatics services to the scientific community in ways that promote scientific progress. 
*  To contribute to the advancement of biology through basic investigator-driven research in bioinformatics. 
*  To provide advanced bioinformatics training to scientists at all levels, from PhD students to independent investigators. 
*  To help disseminate cutting-edge technologies to industry.

=== What is the EB-eye ?===
The EB-eye is a fast and efficient search engine that currently provides easy and uniform access to  biological data resources hosted at the [[European Bioinformatics Institute|EBI]].
The project was started in August 2006 and is developed on top of the [[Lucene|Apache Lucene]] technology. It is a Java framework that provides extremely powerful indexing and search capabilities. 
The EB-eye presents the hits of a search in a very simple way and acts as a gateway to access  biological entries and related information in dedicated portals. One of the key features of EB-eye is the capability to coherently display the relationships that exist between diverse databases allowing the user to navigate this network of cross-references.
The user can search globally across all [[European Bioinformatics Institute|EBI]] data resources through the “Global Search” box or even create more specific queries on targeted resources by using the EB-eye [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/querybuilder.ebi Query Builder].
EB-eye publicly exposes both a web and a [[Web services]] [[RESTful]] interface.

=== Access to the EB-eye ===
* From the [https://www.ebi.ac.uk EBI web site]
* From [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch]
* From the [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/swagger.ebi RESTful Web services API]

==== Global Search ====
The global search is available on the [[European Bioinformatics Institute|EBI]] web site. You can simply type some query terms into the text search box there and press the search button (or press Enter). The system then displays a summary page with a list of various data sets and the number of matches found in each of them.

===== Global Search examples =====
* Search for [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/search.ebi?db=allebi&amp;query=insulin+receptor insulin receptor]
* Search for [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/search.ebi?db=allebi&amp;query=p53 p53]
* Search for [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/search.ebi?db=allebi&amp;query=web+production web production team]
* Search for [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/search.ebi?db=allebi&amp;query=escherichia+%21coli escherichia NOT coli] 
* Search for [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/search.ebi?db=allebi&amp;query=C2H2+zinc+finger+family C2H2 zinc finger family]
* Search for [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/search.ebi?db=allebi&amp;query=DNA+binding DNA binding]

==== Query Builder====
The [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/querybuilder.ebi Query Builder] allows users to create and save complex queries on the available data to get specific search results. See the [[EB-eye#Complex query examples|complex query examples]] section.

==== What can the user Search for? ====
Many resources at EBI are indexed within the search engine, but some are  not.
The EB-eye can search only the information that gets indexed. This implies that other search engines operating on biological data might yield different results. As a rule of thumb, the EB-eye search engine index identifiers, names, descriptions, keywords and cross-references.

==== Complex query examples ====
* Search for [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/search.ebi?db=uniprot&amp;query=description%3A%28azurin%29 description:azurin]
* Search for [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/search.ebi?db=allebi&amp;query=paired+box+protein+NOT+fragment+NOT+paxillin paired box protein BUT NOT fragment OR paxillin]
* Search for [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/search.ebi?db=uniprot&amp;query=description%3A%28paired+box+protein%29++INTERPRO%3A%28IPR001523%29 description:(paired box protein) INTERPRO:(IPR001523)] in UniProtKB
* Search for [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/search.ebi?db=allebi&amp;query=%28bacterium+OR+organism%29+AND+%28unidentified+OR+uncultured%29 (bacterium OR organism) AND (unidentified OR uncultured)] (environmental samples)
* Search for [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/search.ebi?db=biomodels&amp;query=calcium+oscillation calcium oscillation] (Calcium oscillation models)

It is also possible to search using cross-references.

==== Help &amp; documentation for EB-eye ====
Further information about how to use this search engine is available at the EB-eye [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/documentation.ebi help and documentation].

==== Programmatic access to the EB-eye ====
The EB-eye is also programmatically accessible through [[Web services]] technologies using the EB-eye [https://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/swagger.ebi RESTful] interface. The EB-eye [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ebisearch/ws/rest?_wadl RESTful WADL] ([[Web Application Description Language]]) is publicly available. 
See also the [http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/webservices/ main Web services pages] at the [[European Bioinformatics Institute|EBI]].

==== Other Lucene-based search engine in biology/bioinformatics ====
Lucene has been around for a while now. Many bioinformatics centres have been experimenting with its use with biological data and databases. A pioneering development in this field is headed by Dr. Don Gilbert at Indiana University, called [http://gmod.org/wiki/Lucegene LuceGene], a part of the [http://www.gmod.org GMOD] (Generic Software Components for Model Organisms Databases) initiative. Another example is the search engine in the [https://www.uniprot.org  UniProt web site] which is also based on Lucene and adds features such as sorting large data sets, subqueries across data sets and group-by queries. Lucene is also used in QuALM a question answering system for Wikipedia.

[[Image:GaltaTempleWater.jpg|thumb|The lower tank of the temple.]]

'''Galtaji''' is an ancient [[Hindu]] pilgrimage about 10&amp;nbsp;km away from [[Jaipur]], in the Indian state of [[Rajasthan]]. The site consists of a series of temples built into a narrow crevice in the ring of hills that surrounds Jaipur.  A natural spring emerges high on the hill and flows downward, filling a series of  sacred ''kunds'' (water tanks) in which pilgrims bathe.  Visitors and pilgrims can ascend the crevasse, continuing past the highest water pool to a hilltop temple from there are views of Jaipur and its fortifications spreads out across the valley floor.  It is believed that a Saint named Galav lived here, practiced meditation, and did penance (''[[tpasya]]'').&lt;ref name="SachdevTillotson2002"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Vibhuti Sachdev|author2=Giles Henry Rupert Tillotson|title=Building Jaipur: The Making of an Indian City|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=7F_MJcTjDOQC&amp;pg=PA39|accessdate=29 August 2013|year=2002|publisher=Reaktion Books|isbn=978-1-86189-137-2|pages=39–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple features a number of pavilions with rounded roofs, carved pillars, and painted walls. The complex is set around a natural spring and waterfalls that create 7 pools, the upper and lower pool are used for bathing by pilgrims.&lt;ref name="Gold1990"&gt;{{cite book|author=AnnGrodzins Gold|title=Fruitful Journeys: The Ways of Rajasthani Pilgrims|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iAMo1TMH6iYC&amp;pg=PA278|accessdate=29 August 2013|year=1990|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-06959-6|pages=278–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The temple complex of ''Sita Ram ji temple'' is colloquially known as Monkey temple (''Galwar Bagh'') in travel literature, due to the large tribe of monkeys, who live here in the temples, which have been largely abandoned and are only partially restored. These [[rhesus macaques]] were featured in [[National Geographic Channel]]'s ''[[Rebel Monkeys]]'' series and "Thar Desert - Sacred sand" episode of [[Wildest India]] Series.

==Water tanks==
The temple is known for its natural springs, the water from which accumulates in tanks (''kund''s).  There are seven tanks, the holiest being the Galta Kund, which never goes dry.  It is considered auspicious to bathe in the waters of Galtaji, especially on [[Makar Sankranti]], and thousands come to bathe every year.{{fact|date=March 2018}}

'''Game preservation''' is maintaining a stock of game to be hunted legally. It includes:
*Preventing [[poaching]]
*Preventing losses due to attack by [[predator]]s.
*Encouraging breeding, and sometimes captive breeding for release.

==Britain==
Until hand-held [[gun]]s were invented, sport hunting was largely for the deer or [[wild boar]] (by hounds or bow-and-arrow, but [[Ælfric of Eynsham]]'s ''Colloquium'' written in [[Anglo-Saxon]] times speaks of the usual way to catch deer being to drive them into a net), or [[hare]] (by a fast dog); the ''Colloquium'' mentions two [[stag]]s and a [[wild boar]] as a typical day's catch.

What are now called [[game bird]]s were caught by [[falconry]], or had to be netted or snared or trapped or [[birdlime|limed]] by a [[wildfowl|fowler]] employed by the owner of the hunting right. When the fowler used [[falconry]], he seems to have needed to catch and train his hawks; the ''Colloquium'' mentions:
*The fowler offering to sell a hawk in exchange for a swift dog.
*That there are two sorts of hawks, the larger and the smaller, likeliest the [[northern goshawk|goshawk]] and the [[sparrowhawk]].

Most game preservation and poaching centered on [[deer]].

The arrival of firearms changed bird-hunting. At first birds had to be stalked sitting, but changes in shotgun design in the 18th century made it possible to shoot them flying.

&lt;ref name=TLA&gt;''The Long Affray'', by Harry Hopkins, publ. 1985 [[Secker &amp; Warburg]], London, {{ISBN|0-436-20102-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the 18th and 19th centuries game preservation laws became ever more severe in favour of the [[rural gentry]] and their sport shooting rights. Game in Britain was mostly [[deer]], [[hare]]s, [[rabbit]]s, [[pheasant]]s, [[partridge]]s, and [[grouse]]. Game caused much damage to crops, and a persistent complaint among the rural population was not being allowed to kill rabbits and hares to defend crops and garden vegetables. In Scotland farmers dreaded grouse invading ripening cornfields to eat the seeds, and deer in a few nights eating the whole of a crop of [[turnip]]s intended as winter feed for cattle.

Steady growth of industrial towns in the later 19th century gradually built up a stock of population who when called to court (as [[magistrates]] or as [[jury]] members) could not be relied on to automatically support the rural gentry's side of court cases. In 1880 pressure from farmers over damage to crops caused by game and hunting led [[William Ewart Gladstone|Gladstone]]'s government to pass the [[Ground Game Act]].

The book ''The Long Affray''&lt;ref name=TLA/&gt; describes 38 violent fights in the 19th century and 3 in the 18th century, some with shooting and/or death, of gamekeepers plus their helpers versus poachers. Between 1833 and 1843 42 British gamekeepers lost their lives in such incidents. Between autumn 1860 and the end of 1861, over 40 gamekeepers were injured in [[Staffordshire]], some grievously, in fights involving nearly 100 poachers.

[[Mantrap (snare)|Mantrap]]s and [[spring guns]] were often deployed against poachers, but often caught wrong people: for example, a [[parson]] "botanizing", and a naval admiral's 3 sons who entered a game covert for an innocent reason; if a hunted fox went into a game [[covert]] the [[foxhunt]] sometimes lost hounds to devices meant to catch poachers' [[lurcher]]s, and horses by stepping in mantraps.

In the 19th century, [[democratisation]] of local government in rural areas gradually reduced the power of the country squires.

As the [[Industrial Revolution]] advanced, large gangs of coalminers and factory workmen sometimes made poaching forays in numbers that forced the gamekeepers' men to back off and watch, such as:
*A gang of 60 or 70 poachers invaded [[Temple Newsam]]'s game preserve near [[Leeds]], shooting game up to the wall of the mansion.
*A gang of 50 to 60 coalminers and [[ribbon]]-weavers invaded [[D.S.Dugdale]]'s game preserve near [[Coventry]] and [[Nuneaton]] and advanced through a game covert in line abreast: 28 had guns, 12 had sticks, and the rest each knocked 2 stones together; 2 accompanied on horseback to direct the advance of the line.

Through this time, selling game was illegal, but there was a widespread undercover system to transport legally shot and poached game (e.g. in the luggage compartments of [[stagecoach]]es) to traders in towns, much of it to [[Leadenhall Street]] in London. One thing that encouraged poaching was customers (including the [[caterer]]s for the London [[Lord Mayor]]'s Banquet) preferring game without shot damage and with no shot pellets embedded in its flesh: this favored game which had been netted or snared rather than shot.

===Wildlife and game preservation===
In Britain wild predators and scavengers were very badly affected by being shot by [[gamekeeper]]s as "vermin" during the [[wikt:heyday|heyday]] of game preservation in the 18th and 19th centuries: for example, the gamekeepers' records of the [[Glengarry]] Estate in [[Scotland]] record killing in 3 years in the 19th century:
*'''Mammals''': 11 [[fox]]es, 198 [[European wildcat|wildcat]]s, 246 [[marten]]s, 106 [[wikt:polecat|polecat]]s, 67 [[badger]]s, 301 [[stoat]]s and [[weasel]]s, 46 [[otter]]s, 78 [[domestic cat|house cat]]s
*'''Birds of prey''': 27 [[white-tailed sea eagle]]s, 15 [[golden eagle]]s, 3 [[European honey buzzard|honey buzzard]]s, 18 [[osprey]]s, 63 [[northern goshawk|goshawk]]s, 285 [[common buzzard]]s, 371 [[rough-legged buzzard]]s, 83 [[hen harrier]]s, 5 [[marsh harrier]]s, 98 "blue hawks" (?= [[peregrine falcon]]s), 7 [[red-footed falcon|orange-legged falcon]]s, 275 [[kite (bird)|kite]]s, 11 [[hobby (bird)|hobby hawk]]s, 78 [[merlin (bird)|merlin hawk]]s, 6 [[gyr falcon]]s, 462 [[kestrel]]s, 35 "horned owls", 71 "fern owls" (?= [[short-eared owl]]s)
*'''Other birds''': 1431 [[hooded crow]]s, 475 [[raven]]s, 8 [[magpie]]s

===Relevant laws===
*1389: [[King Richard II]] passed a law bringing in the Qualification law, which only allows men who own more than a certain value of land to hunt game.
*1603: Trading in [[partridge]]s and [[pheasant]]s and [[deer]] was made illegal, but continued illegally through all the times following.
*1723: [[Black Act]] (9 Geo. 1 c. 22), made it a hanging offence to appear armed in a deer park or warren, or to hunt or steal deer, with the face blackened or disguised. Repealed in 1827.
*1803: [[Malicious Shooting or Stabbing Act 1803|Ellenborough]]'s Act made it a [[capital offence]] to forcibly resist arrest. (Gamekeepers had power of arrest.)
*1827: [[Lord Suffield]]'s Bill made [[mantrap (snare)|mantrap]]s and [[spring guns]] illegal.
*1828: The [[Night Poaching Act 1828]], forbids poaching by night, still in force; introduces [[penal transportation]] as a penalty for poaching.
*1831: The [[Game Act 1831]], established close seasons, and removed the Qualification restriction. Game became the property of whoever owned the land that it was on at the time. Buying and selling game legalised. Still in force.
*1862: The [[Poaching Prevention Act 1862]] allowed police to [[stop and search]] anyone on the road for evidence of poaching. (In theory, this was allowed only if the suspect was coming from a game preserve area.)
*1868: Penal transportation ceases as [[Western Australia]] (the last British colony to do so) refuses to accept any more penal transportees.
*1880: The [[Ground Game Act 1880]], gave land occupiers including tenants the [[unalienable]] right to take [[hare]]s and [[rabbit]]s on their land. Still in force.

==France==
Game preservation in France was enforced as severely and rigidly, until the [[French Revolution]] quickly violently ended the power of the rural gentry, and one of the revolutionary government's first actions was to sweep away the game preservation laws root and branch.

==Life==

Born in Blanefield, by [[Kirkoswald, South Ayrshire|Kirkoswald]], in [[Ayrshire]], he was the fourth son of Gilbert Blane of Blanefield (d.1771) and Agnes McFadzen.&lt;ref name="royalsoced.org.uk"&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied medicine at [[Edinburgh University]] and [[Glasgow University]] (MD 1778)&lt;ref name="Waterston" /&gt; before moving to London.  The challenge of establishing a practice in London was eased by his friendship with Dr William Hunter, elder brother of the famous [[John Hunter (surgeon)|John Hunter]] who is now widely regarded as the father of modern surgery in Britain.  Dr William Hunter introduced Blane to [[George Brydges Rodney, 1st Baron Rodney|Lord Rodney]] who appointed Blane as his personal physician aboard [[HMS Sandwich (1759)|HMS ''Sandwich'']].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Blane was appointed Physician to the Fleet (1779–1783) and accompanied Rodney, initially to pursue the Spanish squadron besieging [[Gibraltar]] and engaging them at the [[Battle of Cape St. Vincent (1780)|Battle of Cape St. Vincent]], and then to the [[West Indies]]. Blane did much to improve the health of sailors by improving their diet and enforcing proper sanitary precautions. He demanded monthly reports from other ships' surgeons which enabled him to build up a detailed picture of the high levels of sickness that affected the squadron.  Despite [[James Lind|James Lind's]] 1753 publication of ''A treatise on scurvy'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=PkRcAAAAcAAJ&amp;pg=PA127&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Lind, James (1753). A treatise on scurvy in three parts|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; which established the importance of fresh fruit and vegetables in preventing scurvy, the Admiralty had not implemented his recommendations, and scurvy remained a significant cause of sickness in the Fleet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Blane published a pamphlet for the benefit of ships' surgeons in 1780 entitled ''On the most effective means for preserving the health of seamen, particularly in the Royal Navy.''  He advocated the use of citrus juice as a preventative and cure for scurvy in the squadron and eventually, as Commissioner of the Sick and Wounded Board, persuaded the Admiralty to go against the theories of the medical establishment and introduce lemon juice as daily addition to the naval diet in 1795.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Physician to the Fleet: The Life and Times of Thonas Trotter 1760-1832|last = Vale and Edwards|first = |publisher = The Boydell Press|year = 2011|isbn = 978 1 84383 604 9|location = Woodbridge|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Later lemons were replaced by limes which could be obtained from Britain's Caribbean colonies, and for this reason, "[[limey]]" became a common slang word for a British person.&lt;ref name="Distillations"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=   Price |first1=Catherine  |title=The Age of Scurvy |journal=Distillations |date=2017|volume=3|issue=2 |pages=12–23 |url=https://www.sciencehistory.org/distillations/magazine/the-age-of-scurvy|accessdate=April 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On his return to Britain, he became Physician to [[St Thomas' Hospital]] (1783–1795), Physician Extraordinary to the Prince of Wales (1786) and Physician in Ordinary to the King (George IV and William IV). He was a founder member of the [[Fellow of the Royal Society]] in 1784 and delivered their [[Croonian lecture]] in 1788 ''On the Nature of the Muscles, and on the Theory of Muscular Motion''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.royalsociety.org/DServe/dserve.exe?dsqIni=Dserve.ini&amp;dsqApp=Archive&amp;dsqCmd=Show.tcl&amp;dsqDb=Persons&amp;dsqPos=0&amp;dsqSearch=%28Surname%3D%27blane%27%29 |title=Library and Archive Catalogue |publisher=Royal Society |accessdate=15 December 2010 }}{{dead link|date=January 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; By virtue of these court and hospital appointments, he built up a good practice for himself in London, and the government constantly consulted him on questions of [[public hygiene]].&lt;ref name="EB1911"&gt;{{EB1911|inline=1|wstitle=Blane, Sir Gilbert|volume=4|page=41}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1795 Blane was appointed as Commissioner on the Sick and Wounded Board of the Admiralty; the provision of soap, lemons, adequate ventilation and standardised medical stores have all been attributed to his reforms.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He was an instrumental advisor to the government in the drafting of the 1799 Quarantine Act. Blane left the Commission in 1802.[[File:17850000-Tourniquet Use-GILBERT-BLANE.jpg|thumb|Blane advocated that each man be issued a tourniquet in battle.  ''Observations on the diseases incident to seamen'' (1785), pp. 498-499]]In 1809 Blane provided expert medical advice with regards to the [[Walcheren expedition]].  This involved a British occupation of [[Walcheren|Walcheren Island]] with 40,000 men.  The island was surrounded by marshland and many troops were struck down with 'Walcheren Fever', most likely [[malaria]]. The General Staff heeded Blane's advice that the occupying forces should be evacuated due to the likelihood of sickness.  In reward for his services to the Walcheren expedition and his other Naval contributions he was made [[baronet]], of [[Blanefield]] in the [[County of Ayr]], on 26 December 1812.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette |issue=16663 |date=31 October 1812 |page=2189}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

His printed works include ''Observations on the Diseases of Seamen'' (1785)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Observations on the diseases incident to seamen|last = Blane|first = GIlbert|publisher = London: Joseph Cooper; Edinburgh: William Creech|year = 1785|isbn = |location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Elements of Medical Logic'' (1819).&lt;ref name="EB1911" /&gt;

He was an advocate for issuing each [[Royal Navy]] sailor with a [[tourniquet]] to stem catastrophic bleeding in battle.

Blane lived at [[Burghfield]] in Berkshire and at [[Kirkoswald, South Ayrshire|Kirkoswald]] in Ayrshire.

==Death==
He died at Sackville Street in the [[Piccadilly]] area of [[London]] on 26 June 1834.&lt;ref name="royalsoced.org.uk" /&gt;

==Family==

Blane married Elizabeth Gardiner in 1786. She died in 1832.&lt;ref name="royalsoced.org.uk"/&gt;

== The Gilbert Blane Medal ==
[[File:20160816-Gilbert Blane Medal.jpg|thumb|The Gilbert Blane Medal designed by [[Benedetto Pistrucci]]. The example above was awarded to Surg Lt Cdr Jowan Penn-Barwell in 2015.]]
In 1830 Sir Gilbert Blane established, with the sanction of the Board of the Admiralty, a fund for the encouragement of Naval Medical science, which was vested in the corporation of the Royal Colleges of Surgeons of London.  The fund of £300 was to be used to confer gold medals, to be awarded jointly by the Presidents of the Royal Colleges of Physicians and Surgeons, to the Medical Officer of the Royal Navy who was judged to demonstrate ''"the most distinguished proofs of skill, diligence, humanity and learning in the exercise of their professional duties"''. The medal was designed by [[Benedetto Pistrucci]] who had designed the 1817 St George and dragon reverse of the British [[Sovereign (British coin)|gold sovereign]] which is still used today.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.royalmintmuseum.org.uk/history/people/artists/benedetto-pistrucci/index.html|title=The Royal Mint Museum|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=22 August 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is currently struck in [[Gold plating|gold-plated]] [[Sterling silver]]; the reverse side is inscribed with the motto '''Mente Manuque''&lt;nowiki/&gt;'; with mind and hand. Under the original terms, a pair of medals would be awarded biennially.  Blane himself judged the first award of a pair of medals in 1832; to [[John Liddell (doctor)|Dr John Liddell]] of [[HMS Asia (1824)|HMS ''Asia'']] for his preparations for the 1827 [[Battle of Navarino]] and to Dr William Donnelly of HMS ''Hussar'' for his examinations of the nature of syphilis and rheumatic fever.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These were the only medals adjudicated by Blane prior to his death in 1834. In 1913 the rules of the prize were amended and the medal was to be awarded to the Medical Officer who achieved the highest mark in his professional examinations for promotion to Staff Surgeon.  In 1936 the regulations were again changed to a form that remains extant to this day:&lt;blockquote&gt;This fund is employed for the purposes of conferring a Gold Medal on the Medical Officer of the Royal Navy who, to a degree which is considered worthy of recognition, has brought about an advance in any branch of Medical Science in its application to Naval Service, or has contributed to an improvement in any matter affecting the health or living conditions of Naval personnel. In adjudicating the award of the Medal consideration will be given to achievement by Medical Officers in research, in original articles and reports; criticisms of a constructive character of existing conditions; and information which is brought to notice or work performed, or suggestions made, by Medical Officers within the scope of the regulations governing the award as stated above.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/JRNMSVOL89Images/JRNMS_VOL_89#page/n125/mode/2up Journal Royal Naval Medical Service 2003 89(3);121-122]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Coulter|first=JL|date=1960|title=The Gilbert Blane medal|url=https://archive.org/stream/JRNMSVOL46Images/JRNMS_VOL_46#page/n155/mode/2up|journal=Journal of the Royal Naval Medical Service|volume=46|issue=4|pages=183–91|doi=|pmid=|access-date=16 August 2016|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The Gilbert Blane Medal is awarded annually to this day, alternately by the [[Royal College of Surgeons of England]] and the [[Royal College of Physicians]], upon the recommendation of the Medical Director General (Navy).  The medal was last awarded to Surg Lt Cdr Matthew O'Shea in 2018 for his work on reviewing the military relevance of [[tuberculosis]] in the modern era.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.birmingham.ac.uk/university/colleges/mds/news/2018/02/hawkey-oshea-awards.aspx|title=Birmingham researchers awarded the Garrod Medal and the Gilbert Blane Medal|last=|first=|date=2 February 2018|website=|access-date=24 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Giuseppe Levi''' (October 14, 1872 – February 3, 1965) was an Italian [[Anatomy|anatomist]] and [[Histology|histologist]], professor of [[Outline of human anatomy|human anatomy]] (since 1916) at the universities of [[University of Sassari|Sassari]], [[University of Palermo|Palermo]] and [[University of Turin|Turin]]. He was born on October 14, 1872 in [[Trieste]] to Jewish parents, Michele Levi and Emma Perugia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.treccani.it/enciclopedia/giuseppe-levi_%28Dizionario-Biografico%29/|title=LEVI, Giuseppe|author = Pannese, Ennio| work = [[Dizionario Biografico degli Italiani]] | publisher=[[Istituto dell'Enciclopedia Italiana]]|year = 2005| volume =64|accessdate=2012-12-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was married to Lidia Tanzi and had five children: Gino, Mario, Alberto, Paola (who became the wife of [[Adriano Olivetti]]), and writer [[Natalia Ginzburg]] (wife of [[Leone Ginzburg]] and mother of [[Carlo Ginzburg]]),&lt;ref name="bio-natalia-ginzburg"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bio-levi-treccani" /&gt; who described her father's personality in the successful Italian book ''Lessico famigliare'' (1963).

Levi was a pioneer of ''in vitro'' studies of cultured cells. He contributed to the study of the nervous system, especially on the plasticity of sensory ganglion cells.&lt;ref name="bio-levi-neurosci"/&gt;

While in Turin, he tutored three students who later won the [[Nobel prize]]: [[Salvador Luria]], [[Renato Dulbecco]] and [[Rita Levi-Montalcini]].&lt;ref name="bio-levi-neurosci"/&gt;

He was admitted as a national member of the [[Accademia Nazionale dei Lincei]] in 1926.&lt;ref name="bio-levi-treccani" /&gt; In 1931 he subscribed to the oath of allegiance to the Fascist regime imposed to University professors.

[[File:Garden of herbs.jpg|thumb|A variety of herbs are visible in this [[garden]]. Pictured is [[Mentha|mint]], along with some other herbs]]

In general use, '''herbs'''&lt;!--please do not change to the singular; this has caused problems over "an herb" vs. "a herb"--&gt; are plants with savory or aromatic properties that are used for flavoring and [[garnish (food)|garnishing]] food, medicinal purposes, or for fragrances; excluding [[vegetables]] and other plants consumed for [[macronutrients]]. Culinary use typically distinguishes herbs from [[spices]]. ''Herbs'' generally refers to the [[leaf]]y green or [[flower]]ing parts of a plant (either fresh or dried), while ''spices'' are usually dried and produced from other parts of the plant, including [[seed]]s, [[Bark (botany)|bark]], [[root]]s and [[fruit]]s.

Herbs have a variety of uses including culinary, medicinal, and in some cases, spiritual. General usage of the term "herb" differs between culinary herbs and [[medicinal herb]]s; in medicinal or spiritual use, any parts of the plant might be considered as "herbs", including leaves, roots, flowers, seeds, root bark, inner bark (and [[Vascular cambium|cambium]]), [[resin]] and [[pericarp]].

The word "herb" is pronounced {{IPAc-en|h|ɜːr|b}} in [[Commonwealth English]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Cambridge Advanced Learners' Dictionary &amp; Thesaurus |publisher=Cambridge University Press |chapter=Herb |chapter-url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/british/herb?q=herb}}&lt;/ref&gt; but {{IPAc-en|ɜːr|b}} is common among [[North American English]] speakers and those from other regions where [[h-dropping]] occurs. In [[botany]], the word "herb" is used as a synonym for "[[herbaceous plant]]".

==Definition==
[[File:The Herb Garden - geograph.org.uk - 1629279.jpg|thumb|Herb Garden in Derbyshire, England, originally planted in the 1870s by Lady Louisa Egerton, recreated by the National Trust, largely following the original design.]]
In [[botany]], the term herb refers to a [[herbaceous plant]],&lt;ref name="RHS encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Royal Horticultural Society encyclopedia of gardening |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |isbn=9781405303538 |edition=2nd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=pulnPwAACAAJ|pages=404,679}}&lt;/ref&gt; defined as a small, [[Spermatophyte|seed-bearing plant]] without a woody stem in which all aerial parts (i.e. above ground) die back to the ground at the end of each [[growing season]].&lt;ref name="Allaby2012"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Allaby |first1=Michael |title=A Dictionary of Plant Sciences |date=2012 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780191079030 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DB09DAAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt; Usually the term refers to perennials,&lt;ref name="RHS encyclopedia" /&gt; although herbaceous plants can also be [[Annual plant|annual]]s (where the plant dies at the end of the growing season and grows back from seed next year),&lt;ref name="Stuart1989"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Stuart |first1=Malcolm |title=The Encyclopedia of herbs and herbalism |date=1989 |publisher=Crescent Books |isbn=978-0517353264 |page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; or [[Biennial plant|biennial]]s.&lt;ref name="RHS encyclopedia" /&gt; This term is in contrast to [[shrub]]s and [[tree]]s which possess a woody stem.&lt;ref name="Allaby2012" /&gt; Shrubs and trees are also defined in terms of size, where shrubs are less than 10 meters tall, and trees may grow over 10 meters.&lt;ref name="Allaby2012" /&gt; The word herbaceous is derived from Latin ''herbāceus'' meaning "grassy", from ''herba'' "grass, herb".&lt;ref name="OED"&gt;{{cite book |title=Oxford dictionary of English. |date=2010 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199571123 |page=819 |edition=3rd |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=anecAQAAQBAJ}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another sense of the term herb can refer to a much larger range of plants,&lt;ref name="Bown1995"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bown |first1=Deni |title=Encyclopedia of herbs &amp; their uses |date=1995 |publisher=Dorling Kindersley |isbn=978-0751302035 |pages=10,11}}&lt;/ref&gt; with culinary, therapeutic or other uses.&lt;ref name="RHS encyclopedia" /&gt; For example, some of the most commonly described herbs such as Sage, Rosemary and Lavender would be excluded from the botanical definition of a herb as they do not die down each year, and they possess woody stems.&lt;ref name="Stuart1989" /&gt; In the wider sense, herbs may be herbaceous perennials but also trees,&lt;ref name="Bown1995" /&gt; subshrubs,&lt;ref name="Bown1995" /&gt; shrubs,&lt;ref name="Bown1995" /&gt; annuals,&lt;ref name="Bown1995" /&gt; [[liana]]s,&lt;ref name="Bown1995" /&gt; [[fern]]s,&lt;ref name="Bown1995" /&gt; [[moss]]es,&lt;ref name="Bown1995" /&gt; [[algae]],&lt;ref name="Bown1995" /&gt; [[lichen]]s,&lt;ref name="Stuart1989" /&gt; and [[fungi]].&lt;ref name="Stuart1989" /&gt; Herbalism can utilize not just stems and leaves but also fruit, roots, bark and gums.&lt;ref name="Stuart1989" /&gt; Therefore one suggested definition of a herb is a plant which is of use to humans,&lt;ref name="Stuart1989" /&gt; although this definition is problematic since it could cover a great many plants that are not commonly described as herbs.

[[ancient Greece|Ancient Greek]] philosopher [[Theophrastus]] divided the plant world into trees, shrubs and herbs.&lt;ref name="Bremness1994"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bremness |first1=Lesley |title=The complete book of herbs |publisher=Viking Studio Books |isbn=9780140238020 |page=8 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VqfnrH-W2kwC}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herbs came to be considered in 3 groups, namely [[pot herb]]s (e.g. onions), sweet herbs (e.g. thyme) and salad herbs (e.g. wild celery).&lt;ref name="Stuart1989" /&gt; During the seventeenth century as [[selective breeding]] changed the plants size and flavor away from the wild plant, pot herbs began to be referred to as [[vegetable]]s as they were no longer considered only suitable for the pot.&lt;ref name="Stuart1989" /&gt;

== Culinary herbs ==
[[File:Thyme-Bundle.jpg|thumb|A bundle of [[Thymus (plant)|thyme (''Thymus'')]]]]
{{See also|List of culinary herbs and spices}}
Culinary herbs are distinguished from [[vegetable]]s in that, like spices, they are used in small amounts and provide [[flavor]] rather than substance to [[food]].&lt;ref name="Small National Research Council Canada 2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Small |first=E. |author2=National Research Council Canada |title=Culinary Herbs |publisher=NRC Research Press |year=2006 |isbn=978-0-660-19073-0 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UL9lpNrx0kwC&amp;pg=PA1 |access-date=9 October 2018 |page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Herbs can be [[perennial]]s such as [[thyme]] or [[lavender]], [[Biennial plant|biennials]] such as [[parsley]], or [[Annual plant|annuals]] like [[basil]]. Perennial herbs can be [[shrub]]s such as [[rosemary]], ''Rosmarinus officinalis'', or [[tree]]s such as [[bay laurel]], ''Laurus nobilis''&amp;nbsp;– this contrasts with [[Herbaceous plant|botanical herbs]], which by definition cannot be woody plants. Some plants are used as both herbs and spices, such as [[dill]] weed and dill seed or [[coriander]] leaves and seeds. There are also some herbs, such as those in the mint family, that are used for both culinary and medicinal purposes.

Emperor [[Charlemagne]] (742-814) compiled a list of 74 different herbs that were to be planted in his gardens. The connection between herbs and health is important already in the European Middle Ages--''[[The Forme of Cury]]'' (that is, "cookery") promotes extensive use of herbs, including in salads, and claims in its preface "the assent and advisement of the masters of physic and philosophy in the King's Court".&lt;ref name="Freeman"&gt;{{cite book |title=Herbs for the Medieval Household, for Cooking, Healing and Divers uses |pages=ix–x |first=Margaret B. |last=Freeman |location=New York |publisher=The Metropolitan Museum of Art |year=1943}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Herbal teas==
{{main|Herbal tea}}
Some herbs can be infused in boiling water to make herbal teas (also termed tisanes).&lt;ref name="RHS encyclopedia" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Bown1995" /&gt; Typically the dried leaves, flowers or seeds are used, or fresh herbs are used.&lt;ref name="RHS encyclopedia" /&gt; Herbal teas tend to made from aromatic herbs,&lt;ref name="Bremness1994" /&gt; may not contain [[tannin]]s or [[caffeine]],&lt;ref name="RHS encyclopedia" /&gt; and are not typically mixed with milk.&lt;ref name="Bown1995" /&gt; Common examples include [[chamomile]] tea,&lt;ref name="Bown1995" /&gt; or [[Mint tea]].&lt;ref name="Bremness1994" /&gt;

== Medicinal herbs ==
{{Main|Medicinal plants|Herbalism}}
{{see also|List of plants used in herbalism|}}
[[File:In Effigiam Nicholai Culpeper Equitis by Richard Gaywood.jpg|thumb|[[Nicholas Culpeper]] was an English [[botany|botanist]], [[Herbalism|herbalist]], [[physician]], and [[astrology|astrologer]].&lt;ref name="ODNB"&gt;Patrick Curry: "Culpeper, Nicholas (1616–1654)", ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'' (Oxford, UK: OUP, 2004)&lt;/ref&gt; (etching by Richard Gaywood between 1644 and 1662)]]

Herbs were used in [[prehistoric medicine]]. As far back as 5000 BCE, evidence that [[Sumer]]ians used herbs in medicine was inscribed on cuneiform.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Ruth D. |last=Wrensch |title=The Essence of Herbs |publisher=University Press of Mississippi |year=1992 |page=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 162 CE, the physician [[Galen]] was known for concocting complicated herbal remedies that contained up to 100 ingredients.&lt;ref name="Tapsell"&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Tapsell LC, Hemphill I, Cobiac L, Sullivan DR, Fenech M, Patch CS, Roodenrys S, Keogh JB, Clifton PM, Williams PG, Fazio VA, Inge KE |date=2006 |title=Health benefits of herbs and spices: The past, the present, the future |journal=Medical Journal of Australia |volume=185 |issue=4 |pages=S1–S24 |url=http://ro.uow.edu.au/hbspapers/1397/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some plants contain [[phytochemical]]s that have effects on the body.  There may be some effects when consumed in the small levels that typify culinary "spicing", and some herbs are toxic in larger quantities. For instance, some types of herbal extract, such as the extract of St. John's-wort (''[[Hypericum perforatum]]'') or of kava (''[[Piper methysticum]]'') can be used for medical purposes to relieve depression and stress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Adele G Dawson |title=Herbs, Partners in Life: Healing, Gardening and Cooking with Wild Plants |publisher=Bear &amp; Co. |year=2000 |pages=5–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, large amounts of these herbs may lead to toxic overload that may involve complications, some of a serious nature, and should be used with caution. Complications can also arise when being taken with some prescription medicines.

Herbs have long been used as the basis of traditional [[Chinese herbal medicine]], with usage dating as far back as the first century [[Common Era|CE]] and far before. In India, the [[Ayurveda]] medicinal system is based on herbs.  Medicinal use of herbs in Western cultures has its roots in the [[Hippocratic]] (Greek) elemental healing system, based on a quaternary elemental healing metaphor. Famous herbalist of the Western tradition include [[Avicenna]] (Persian), [[Galen]] (Roman), [[Paracelsus]] (German Swiss), [[Nicholas Culpeper|Culpepper]] (English) and the botanically inclined Eclectic physicians of 19th century/early 20th century America ([[John Milton Scudder]], [[Harvey Wickes Felter]], [[John Uri Lloyd]]). Modern pharmaceuticals had their origins in crude herbal medicines, and to this day, some drugs are still extracted as fractionate/isolate compounds from raw herbs and then purified to meet pharmaceutical standards.

Certain herbs contain psychoactive properties that have been used for both religious and recreational purposes by humans since the early [[Holocene]] era, notably the leaves and extracts of the [[cannabis]] and [[coca]] plants. The leaves of the coca plant have been chewed by people in northern [[Peru]]vian societies for over 8,000 years,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Dillehay T, Rossen J, Ugent D, Karathanasis A, Vásquez V, Netherly P |year=2010 |title=Early Holocene coca chewing in northern Peru |journal=Antiquity |volume=84 |issue=326 |pages=939–953 |doi=10.1017/S0003598X00067004}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the use of cannabis as a psychoactive substance dates back to the first century CE in [[China]] and northern [[Africa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Ernest Abel |title=Marihuana: The First Twelve Thousand Years |publisher=Springer |location=New York |year=1980 |isbn=978-0-306-40496-2 |url=https://cannabis-truth.yolasite.com/resources/Abel.%20marihuana%20the%20first%20twelve%20thousand%20years.pdf |access-date=2018-07-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[indigenous peoples of Australia]] developed herbal medicine based on plants that were readily available to them. The isolation of the [[Indigenous peoples of Australia|indigenous people]] meant the remedies developed were for far less serious diseases, this was from not contracting western illnesses. Herbs such as [[Mentha australis|river mint]], [[Acacia pycnantha|wattle]] and [[eucalyptus]] were used for coughs, diarrhea, fever and headaches.&lt;ref name="Tapsell" /&gt;

== Sacred herbs ==

[[File:Balsamodendron ehrenbergianum00.jpg|thumb|''[[Commiphora gileadensis]]'' (Gilead myrrh)]]
Herbs are used in many [[religion]]s.  During the monastic era, monks would cultivate herbs alongside vegetables, while others would be set aside in medicinal herb garden for specific purposes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=English Herb Garden |first=Guy |last=Cooper |first2=Gordon I. |last2=Taylor |publisher=Random House |year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[myrrh]] (''Commiphora myrrha'') and [[frankincense]] (''Boswellia'' species) in [[Hellenistic religion]], the [[Nine Herbs Charm|nine herbs charm]] in [[Anglo-Saxon paganism]], [[neem]] (''Azadirachta indica'') leaves, [[bael]] (''Aegele marmelos'') leaves, holy basil or ''tulsi'' (''[[Ocimum tenuiflorum]]''), [[turmeric]] or "haldi" (''Curcuma longa''), [[cannabis]] in [[Hinduism]], and [[white sage]] in [[Wicca]]. [[Rastafari movement|Rastafari]] also consider [[Cannabis (drug)|cannabis]] to be a holy plant.

[[Siberia]]n [[shaman]]s also used herbs for spiritual purposes. Plants may be used to induce spiritual experiences for rites of passage, such as [[vision quest]]s in some [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Native American]] cultures.

Originally there was always doubt in ancient societies, especially in the sceptical medium of western traditions, as to the efficacity of herbal medicines.  The use of [[herbal cosmetics]] dates back to around six centuries ago in the European and Western countries. Mixtures and pastes were often concocted to whiten the face. During the 1940s, herbal cosmetics took a turn with the emerging red lipstick color, with every year gaining a more intense red. Herbal cosmetics come in many forms, such as face creams, scrubs, lipstick, natural fragrances, powders, body oils, deodorants and sunscreens.  They activate through the epithelium of sebaceous glands to make the skin more supple.  Ayurvedic oils are widely used in India, prized for their natural health-giving properties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=H. |last=Panda |title=Herbal Cosmetics Handbook |edition=3rd |publisher=Asia-Pacific Business Press |year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One method and perhaps the best, used to extract natural oils from herbs to make lipstick is [[partition chromatography]].  The process involves separation in watery solution, and then the injection of colour under pressure.

==Strewing herbs==
{{main|Strewing herb}}
Strewing herbs are scattered (strewn) over the floors of dwelling places and other buildings. Such plants usually have fragrant or astringent smells, and many also serve as insecticides (e.g. to repel flees) or disinfectants. For example, [[meadowsweet]] was sometimes strewn across floors in the middle ages because of its sweet smell.&lt;ref name="Bown1995" /&gt;

[[File:Père-Lachaise - Division 87 - Columbarium 1062.jpg|thumb|Karen Bramson's grave at the [[Père Lachaise Cemetery]] in Paris]]
'''Karen Bramson''' (''[[née]]'' Adler; born 10&amp;nbsp;August 1875 in [[Lyngby-Taarbæk Municipality|Tårbæk]], Denmark and died 26&amp;nbsp;January 1936 in Paris, France) was a Danish author who wrote novels and plays mostly in Danish or French although many of her writings have been translated into English.

Bramson spent her early life in Denmark and her later life in France.  She was awarded the [[Légion d'honneur]] for her work during the First World War and for her contributions to French literature.

==Early life in Denmark==
Karen Adler was born on August 10, 1875, in Tårbæk, [[Denmark]] with parents Julius Frederick Adler a wealthy cigar merchant in Copenhagen and Dorothea (Thea) Monies&lt;ref name = DBL/&gt; a second cousin of the physicist [[Niels Bohr]].&lt;ref name = Brenner/&gt;  She had several siblings, one of which was her elder brother, David Julius Adler. Karen was apparently a better writer than David, because she would sometimes write David Adler's school essays for him. Karen Adler started writing plays at the age of 12 and at 14, had a play in two acts - "Veninder" (Girlfriends) and "I pension for unge piger" (In a boarding house for young girls) - accepted at the [[Folketeatret, Copenhagen|Folketeatret]] (People's Theatre) in Copenhagen for a fee of 200 Danish Kroner.&lt;ref name = Holst&gt;{{Cite web | last = Holst | first = Holger Christian | date = 4 May 2000 | url = http://sites.univ-provence.fr/~wperse/holst.htm | title = Le jeune Alexis Leger/Saint-John Perse vu par Karen Bramson | trans-title = Young Alexis Leger/Saint-John Perse as seen by Karen Bramson | website = Colloque international Postérités de Saint-John Perse | language = French, English | publisher = Aix Marseilles University | access-date =  12 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; She had insisted that she should remain anonymous, but the theatre director could not resist giving her name to the local newspaper. Karen hurriedly withdrew her play and refunded the fee to avoid scandal and her father's wrath, for in 1890s Copenhagen, it was unheard of for a young lady of her class to attract such publicity and get paid for writing a play.&lt;ref name = KVInfo&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.kvinfo.dk/side/597/bio/216/origin/170/|title= Karen Bramson (1875 - 1936)|last1= Jensen |first1= Marianne Majgaard |date= 2003 |publisher=KVINFO |website= [[Dansk kvindebiografisk leksikon]] (Danish women's autobiographical library) |language = Danish |access-date= 6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1893, at the age of 17, Karen Adler married Louis Bramson (b. 1861 - d 1952). Louis, like Karen, came from a relatively prosperous Danish family, was a doctor and was 15 years older than Karen.&lt;ref name = DBL/&gt; In 1895 they had a son, Mogens Bramson. Karen Bramson continued to write and made her début in print with the two plays "Den unge Frue. Mands Vilje" (The young lady - Man's Will) published in 1900 and performed in 1907&lt;ref name = DBH/&gt; at the People's Theatre in Copenahgen.

In 1904, Karen and Louis Bramson built a country mansion which they called Solgården (Sun Yard) near the sea in Strøby Egede, [[Stevns Municipality]] just south of Copenhagen.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |date = 2015 | url = http://www.visitdenmark.co.uk/en-gb/denmark/solgardsparken-in-stroeby-egede-gdk619900 | title = Solgardsparken in Stroeby Egede | website = Visit Denmark | publisher = Danish Tourist Office | access-date = 20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; They invited artists from different parts of Europe and held plays on a stage they had built there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | date = 2015 | url = http://www.solgaardsparken.dk/default.asp?pageID=2 | title =  Solgårdsparken, Strøby Egede, Historiske billeder | trans-title = Solgards park, Stroby Egede, Historic images | language = Danish | publisher = Solgard Park, Strøby Egede | access-date = 20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  King [[Frederick VIII of Denmark]] is said to have stayed there in 1911 and, in commemoration, is said to have presented Karen with four marble statues of eagles which were placed on the corners of a tower in the building.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | publication-date = April 2008 | url= http://www.bruun-rasmussen.dk/vfs/catalogues/786/786_mob-porc | publisher = Bruun Rasmussen Antiques | publication-place = Copenhagen, Denmark | title = Auction 786; The Departments of Decorative Art |  page = 7 | access-date = 20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = Solgarden&gt;{{Cite web | date = 2015 | url = http://www.solgaardsparken.dk/default.asp?pageID=1 | title = Historien bag Solgårdsparken | trans-title = The History of Solgards Park | language = Danish | publisher =  Solgard Park, Strøby Egede |access-date = 20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web | url = http://historiskatlas.dk/Solg%C3%A5rdsparken_(6682) | title = Solgårdsparken | trans-title = Solgards park | publisher = Historical atlas | language = Danish | access-date = 20 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1912, Karen Bramson was elected a councillor of [[Copenhagen Municipality]] but declined, preferring to concentrate on writing.&lt;ref name = Suffragette&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Suffragette Refuses Office and Gains Literary Honors.

She was to spend the rest of her life in France.&lt;ref name = Solgarden/&gt;

==Literary career in France==
After Karen Bramson settled permanently in Paris, France at the beginning of the First World War, she wrote mostly in French.  During the war, she was attached to the press department of the French [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs]], which tried to create international awareness of the country's situation. Bramson was an enthusiastic writer and propagandist for the French cause and tried to help the plight of French prisoners of war in Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title= Says Germany Spreads Phtsisis Among Prisoners; Tuberculous Victims Deliberately Mixed with Others, Mme.

After the war, her greatest triumph was the performance in 1923 of her play "Le Professeur Klenow" at the [[Theatre de l'Odeon]] in Paris&lt;ref&gt;(2015) [http://www.theatre-odeon.eu/en/p Répertoire] Odéon Théâtre de l'Europe, Paris, Retrieved 3 June 2015&lt;/ref&gt; with actor [[Poul Reumert]] in the lead role.&lt;ref name = RegieTheatrale&gt;{{cite web

Shortly before, at the same theatre, her play "De evige Fjender" (The Eternal Enemies) with Reumert and the actress [[Bodil Ipsen]] in the lead roles met with limited success. However, in June 1924 the same play translated into English with the title "Tigercats" and starring [[Edith Evans]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Worsley|first1=Luccy|title=The Times Great Women's Lives: A Celebration in Obituaries|date=15  September 2014|publisher=The History Press|location=United Kingdom|isbn=9780750962346|chapter=Dame Edith Evans}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nicholas Hannen (actor)|Nicholas Hannen]]&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Obituary: Fru Karen Bramson|last=|first=|date=1936-01-28|newspaper=The Times|access-date=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|work=|page=13|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Robert Loraine]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Senelick|first1=Laurence|title=Theatre Arts on Acting|date=September 2013|publisher=Routledge|location=United Kingdom|isbn=9781134723751|page=316}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Liggera|first1=Lanayre D.|title=The Life of Robert Loraine: The Stage, the Sky, and George Bernard Shaw|date=August 2013|publisher=University of Delaware Press|location=USA|isbn=9781611494594|page=181}}&lt;/ref&gt; was performed at the  [[Garrick Theatre]] and then the [[Royal Strand Theatre]]  in London, where it was much more successful and ran for 116 performances.&lt;ref name = LondonStage&gt;{{cite book | first =  J.P. | last = Wearing | title = The London Stage 1920-1929: A Calendar of Productions, Performers, and Personnel |edition=2nd | publisher = Rowman &amp; Littlefield Education|location = London, UK| date = 2014 | isbn = 978-0810893016 | oclc = 863695327|page = 313 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Tigercats", directed by [[David Belasco]] also ran for 48 performances in the [[Belasco Theatre]] on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] in New York with [[Katharine Cornell]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Sicherman|first1=Barbara|last2=Green|first2=Carol Hurd|title=Notable American Women: A Biographical Dictionary, Volume 4: The Modern Period|date=January  1986|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=USA|isbn=9780674627338|page=168}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Lorraine in the lead roles.&lt;ref name = TigerCats&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.ibdb.com/production.php?id=9606 |title= Tiger Cats|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2015 |publisher= The Internet Broadway Database|access-date= 6 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other plays by Karen Bramson performed in England about this time were "Medusa", "The Godless" ([[Wyndham's Theatre|Wyndhams theatre]] December 1925), "The Enchantress" (The [[Garrick Theatre]] April 1926), "The Man they Buried…" (The [[Ambassadors Theatre (London)|Ambassadors Theatre]] June 1928) and "The Tower of Babel" (Venturers Society July 1929).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name = LondonStage/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.kent.ac.uk/library/specialcollections/theatre/r.php/36461/show.html|title= Theatre collections: Medusa (La Femme Fatale) | last1= Adller |first1= F.  |date= 8 March 1926 |website= University of Kent, UK, Special Collections|publisher= the Pleasure Gardens Theatre, Folkstone, Kent, England|access-date= 10 June  2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Tigercats" was revived at the [[Royalty Theatre|Royalty theatre]] in May 1931 with Edith Evans and Robert Lorraine in the same roles as before.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  In 1925 she was the first foreign female author to have a play accepted at the [[Comédie-Française]] in Paris.&lt;ref name = Loiret&gt;{{cite news |date= 28 January 1936|title= Mort de l 'écrivain danois Mme Karen-Bramson|trans-title= Death of the Danish author Mrs Karen Bramson|language= French|newspaper= Journal du Loiret|page= 1 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Other plays of hers performed in Paris included "Puissance de Roi" ([[Odéon-Théâtre de l'Europe|Odéon Theatre]]), "Des yeux qui s'ouvrent" (also at the Odéon) and "Bonheur" (Ambassadeurs theatre).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; She was made an Officier in the Légion d'honneur in 1927 because of her contributions to French literature and plays.&lt;ref name = Burials&gt;{{cite web |url= http://gravsted.dk/person.php?navn=karenbramson|title= Karen Bramson, Dansk forfatter |language= Danish | trans-title = Karen Bramson, Danish author | last1= Adller |first1= F.  |date= 2013 |website= |publisher= Kendtes gravsted (Celebrity burials) |access-date= 6 June  2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1934 she also received the [[Tagea Brandt Rejselegat]] Danish award.
Karen Bramson was known in fashionable circles in Paris had a reputation for being a brilliant hostess inviting artists, diplomats and politicians to receptions in her house. For example, she was friends with the poet and diplomat [[Saint-John Perse]] (who was awarded the [[Nobel Prize for Literature]]), the diplomat [[Philippe Berthelot]], his wife Hélène&lt;ref name = Holst/&gt; and the French politician [[Louis Barthou]].&lt;ref name = Figaro&gt;{{cite news |date= 1 February 1936|title= Nécrologie - Les obsèques du Mme Karen Bramson|trans-title= Obituary - Funeral of Mrs Karen Bramson|language= French|newspaper= Le Figaro|location= Paris, France}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Despite her versatile talents, her literary ambitions and a life in the media spotlight, her inner personality was mostly hidden. She disliked giving interviews and was reticent about divulging details of her personal life.&lt;ref name = KVInfo/&gt;

==Final years and Death==

==Reception and legacy==
Her first plays ("The Young Lady", "Man's Will" in 1900 and "Mothers" in 1901 ) have been described as focussing on the oppression women suffer in marriage and she often explored themes of interpersonal relationships and the battle of the sexes.  Deadly love and female masochist tendencies have also been mentioned by reviewers.&lt;ref name = DBL/&gt; One newspaper review of her play "Tiger Cats" noted the London audience "...consisting mainly of middle-aged, unmarried women cheered wildly these scenes of sadism."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wearing|first1=J.

==Bramson's family==
Karen Bramson and her husband Louis Bramson had one son Mogens Louis Bramson&lt;ref name = Mogens/&gt;  After 1914, she lived apart from her husband, but had a friendly relationship with him throughout her life.

'''Lake Pancharevo''' (Панчаревско езеро, ''Pancharevsko ezero'' or Язовир Панчарево, ''Pancharevo Reservoir'') is an [[artificial lake]] in western [[Bulgaria]], at the end of the [[Pancharevo Gorge]] of the [[Iskar River]], located at 600 m above sea level between the [[Vitosha]] and [[Lozenska]] mountains. It is 3&amp;nbsp;km long and up to 700 m wide, reaching a depth of 30 m, and is situated 12&amp;nbsp;km southeast of the capital city of [[Sofia]], where the [[Vitoshka Bistritsa]] flows into the [[Iskar (river)|Iskar]]. The villages of [[Pancharevo]] and [[Kokalyane]] and the Pancharevo [[mineral spring]]s lies on the lake's western shore, while at the southern end of the lake there is a [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] power station. Sports centres and catering establishments have been constructed around the lake, making it a favoured outing location for the residents of Sofia. Further upstream in the gorge there are two additional artificial lakes: the [[Pasarel Reservoir]] and the [[Iskar Reservoir]].

The lake was created in 1956 in connection with the construction of Hydrohub "Iskar", as a drinking, irrigation and energy source for the Sofia Agglomeration.

The (Sredets) National Rowing Base is located on the shore of Lake Pancharevo. Built in 1968, the rowing base is the first modern facility in [[Bulgaria]], specializing in conducting training and competitions in rowing events. In 1977 it hosted the World Cup canoe in the capital, and in 1981, the World Championships for young people in water sports. Over the years, it has been host to several world championships, national and international rowing regattas, and the European Triathlon Championships.

The '''Living Standards Measure''' or LSM is a marketing and research tool used in [[South Africa]] to classify [[standard of living]] and [[disposable income]]. It segments the population into ten [[decile]]s based on their relative means, with LSM 1 being the decile with the least means and 10 being the decile with the greatest means. It does this by ranking people based on ownership of the components of a standard basket of goods (which varies over time). For instance, those people who owned a television set would rank higher in the LSM than those who did not.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Living Standards Measure|url=http://www.saarf.co.za/lsm/lsms.asp|website=South African Audience Research Foundation|publisher=South African Audience Research Foundation|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In effect, the LSM is an [[Income inequality metrics|income inequality metric]], despite specifically excluding income as one of the tested metric.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|first=Werner|last=Ruch|title=Measuring poverty in SA|magazine=The Fieldworker|publisher=Stats SA|date=July 2014|volume=5|url=http://www.statssa.gov.za/wp-content/uploads/2014/07/Fieldworker-Low-Res-June-2014.pdf|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its components are reflective of the fact that South Africa has a high [[Gini coefficient]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=South Africa Overview|url=http://www.worldbank.org/en/country/southafrica/overview|website=The World Bank|publisher=The World Bank|accessdate=20 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12409">'''Local boards''' or '''local boards of health''' were local authorities in urban areas of [[England and Wales]] from 1848 to 1894. They were formed in response to [[cholera]] epidemics and were given powers to control sewers, clean the streets, regulate environmental health risks including [[slaughterhouses]] and ensure the proper supply of water to their districts. Local boards were eventually merged with the corporations of [[municipal borough]]s in 1873, or became [[urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]s in 1894.

==Pre-Public Health Act 1848==
{{see|Improvement commissioners}}

==Public Health Act 1848==
The first local boards were created under the '''Public Health Act 1848''' (11 &amp; 12 Vict. c.63).  The aim of the act was to improve the sanitary condition of towns and populous places in England and Wales by placing: the supply of water; sewerage; drainage; cleansing; paving, and environmental health regulation under a single local body. The act could be applied to any place in England and Wales except the [[City of London]] and some other areas in the [[County of London|Metropolis]] already under the control of [[Metropolitan Commission of Sewers|sewer commissioners]].

The Act was passed by the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]] [[First Russell ministry|government]] of [[John Russell, 1st Earl Russell|Lord John Russell]], in response to the urging of [[Edwin Chadwick]]. This was supported by reports, from local branches of the [[Health of Towns Association]] (formed in 1844), of poor and insanitary conditions in many UK cities.&lt;ref name=Ashton-Ubido&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ashton |first=John |author2=Ubido, Janet |title=The Healthy City and the Ecological Idea |journal=Journal of the Society for the Social History of Medicine |year=1991 |volume=4 |issue=1 |pages=173–181 |url=http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf |accessdate=8 July 2013 |doi=10.1093/shm/4.1.173 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224102422/http://www.johnrashton.securemachines.co.uk/documentbank/the%20healthy%20city%20and%20the%20ecological%20idea.pdf |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===General Board of Health===
The act created a '''General Board of Health''' as a central authority to administer the act. There were three commissioners:- the president of the board being the First Commissioner of Her Majesty's Woods and Forests, Land Revenues, Works and Buildings, the other two members being appointed by warrant. The board was originally to be dissolved after five years, but acts of parliament were passed annually allowing for its continuation.  Chadwick was appointed a Commissioner, and the Board was strongly associated with him. In 1852, Edward Gotto was employed to carry out the national General Board of Health Survey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |last=Thorne |first=Alice |title=An Archaeological Desk-Based Assessment and Walkover Survey of Land at The Pentagon Centre, Chatham |year=Oct 2006 |url=http://archaeologyse.co.uk/ReportLibrary/2006/2006-2565-Pentagon-Centre-Chatham-DBA.pdf |page=19 |accessdate=1 February 2014 |publisher=archaeologyse.co.uk }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The board finally ceased to exist on 1 September 1858.

===Forming a local board of health===
Local boards could be formed in two ways:
* By a petition of one tenth of the inhabitants rated to [[poor law|relief of the poor]] in any city, town, borough (municipal or parliamentary), parish or place with a defined boundary not having less than 30 such qualified ratepayers.
* By the General Board if the death rate exceeded twenty-three in a thousand in any place.

In the latter case a superintending inspector appointed by the General Board would hold an inquiry into the sewerage, drainage, supply of water, state of burial grounds and other matters relating to the sanitary condition of the town, and where necessary define boundaries for the district of the local board.

Where the boundaries of a proposed local board's district were the same as an existing local unit, the act was applied by [[Order in Council]].  Where a new district was created this was done by provisional order of the General Board, confirmed by parliament.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spartacus-educational.com/PHchadwick.htm|title=Edwin Chadwick|author=|date=|website=spartacus-educational.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Membership of a local board===
Members of local boards were either:
* Selected by the corporations of [[municipal borough]]s
* Elected by owners of property and by rate payers

Where a local board district coincided with a borough, or was entirely within a borough's limits, all the members were selected by the corporation.  Where a district was entirely outside a municipality, all the members were elected.  In districts which were partly in and partly outside a borough the board had a mixture of selected and elected members.  Selected members did not have to be members of the corporation. Borough mayors were ''ex officio'' board members.

Those entitled to elect board members could have multiple votes depending on how much property they owned.  This ranged from one vote for owners of property worth less than fifty pounds, to six votes for those holding more than 250 pounds of property. It followed that board members were generally wealthy property owners or members of the professions.

===Powers of a local board===
The powers and duties of a local board of health were enumerated in the act:
* Employees: A local board of health was allowed to appoint a number of employees including a surveyor, a clerk, a treasurer and an officer of health (who had to be a qualified doctor). It was compulsory for the Board to appoint an inspector of nuisances (sanitary inspector) to investigate complaints and take action against 'nuisances' (nuisances was a very broad concept encompassing a wide range of environmental public health problems: such as unsanitary dwellings, accumulations of refuse and sewage, smoke dust and smells and industrial emissions, polluted water, noise, adulterated food, slaughterhouse issues etc.). 
* Sewers: The local board took over ownership of all public sewers in its district. Where private sewers operated for profit, the local board could purchase them.
* Street cleansing: The local board was required to clean the streets in its district, removing dust, ashes, rubbish, filth, dung and soil.
* Public lavatories: The local board could provide "public necessities" (as the act called them).
* Slaughterhouses: The local board was to regulate slaughterhouses, and was allowed to provide such facilities itself.
* Street paving: The local board took over the public streets in the district, and could also require that private streets be paved.
* Pleasure grounds: The local boards were allowed to provide and lay out pleasure grounds.
* Water Supply:	The local board was allowed to supply water, but only if a private company could not provide the service.
* Burials: The local board was allowed to provide houses for the reception of the dead prior to burial. They could also apply to the General Board to have an existing graveyard closed.
* Land:	The local board could purchase land.

==Local Government Act 1858==
The 1848 Act was replaced by the '''Local Government Act 1858''' (21 &amp; 22 Vict. c. 98). The act came into force in all existing local board of health districts on 1 September 1858. The act made some changes to the procedure for constituting a local board and gave them some additional powers. There was also a change in nomenclature: the authorities created by the 1858 act were simply entitled "local boards" and their areas as "local government districts".

===The Local Government Act Office and the Local Government Board===
When the General Board of Health was abolished in 1858 its responsibilities in respect of local government passed to the [[Home Secretary|Secretary of State of the Home Department]], in whose department a '''Local Government Act Office''' was formed to administer the local boards.  In 1871 a separate agency was again formed entitled the [[Local Government Board]], with a President who was frequently a [[Cabinet of the United Kingdom|Cabinet]] member.  The Local Government Board also took over the duties of the [[Poor Law Board]].

===Constituting local boards===
The procedure for adopting the act and constituting a local board was laid out in sections 12 – 17 of the act, and was similar to that in the 1848 act.

Changes made included:
* [[Improvement commissioners]] could adopt the act for their district, the board of commissioners becoming in addition the local board.
* Petitions from ten per cent of the ratepayers of places other than those with a "known or defined boundary" to adopt the act were now made to the Secretary of State. If one in twenty ratepayers objected to the formation of a local board they now had the [[right to petition]] against it.
* The power to create a local board where there was excess mortality was abolished.

The method of electing members of the board remained the same, although existing or new boards could now be divided into wards.

===Additional powers===
The [[Town Police Clauses Act 1847]] had included model clauses for the government of towns which could be adopted in all or in part by existing borough corporations, local boards of health or improvement commissioners. The application of these was very uneven, so they were incorporated into the 1858 act, all local boards gaining these powers.

Areas covered by the clauses were:
* Removal of obstructions and nuisances in the street
* Fires and fire prevention
* Provision and control of places of public resort
* Regulation of [[hackney carriages]]
* Provision of public bathing houses
* Naming streets and numbering houses
* Improving the line of streets
* Removal of ruinous or dangerous buildings
* Provision of public clocks

The local board also took over any lamps, lamp posts and gas posts provided by the [[Lighting and Watching Act 1833]], and was given a new power to provide a market place where one was required or inadequate.

==Number of local boards==
The number of local boards peaked at 721 in 1873.  In that year the [[Public Health Act 1872]] merged local boards into municipal boroughs and improvement commissioners where they shared the same district.  419 of the local boards had been formed under the '''Public Health Act 1848''', the remaining 302 under the '''Local Government Act 1858'''.

The number of local boards was inflated in 1862–63, as communities adopted the act in order to avoid being grouped into [[highway district]]s under the [[Highways Act 1862]].  Many of these local government districts had a population of fewer than 500, and several fewer than 100. Further legislation was passed in 1863 to limit the population of a new local government district to 3,000 or more. Some of these small authorities survived as [[urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]s until the [[Local Government Act 1929|county review orders]] of the 1930s.

==Sanitary districts and urban districts==
The [[Public Health Act 1875]] designated local government districts as [[sanitary district|urban sanitary districts]], with the local board becoming the urban sanitary authority. The titles of the district and board did not change however, the local board assuming extra duties as a sanitary authority.

Local boards and local government districts were finally abolished by the [[Local Government Act 1894]], when all urban sanitary districts became [[urban district (Great Britain and Ireland)|urban district]]s. A new urban district council was to govern the district. The new council was to be directly elected by all those entitled to voted in parliamentary elections, replacing the weighted property voting system used for local boards.

'''National Safety Month (NSM)''' is an annual month-long observance in the [[United States]] each June. 
[[File:National Safety Month Badget.png|thumb|Official Badge of National Safety Month 2018]]
During National Safety Month, individuals and organizations participate by making efforts to reduce the leading causes of unintentional injury and death at [https://www.osha.gov/oshstats/commonstats.html work]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/oshstats/commonstats.html|title=Commonly Used Statistics {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;, on the [http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/t/general-statistics/fatalityfacts/state-by-state-overview road]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.iihs.org/iihs/topics/t/general-statistics/fatalityfacts/state-by-state-overview|title=General statistics|work=IIHS|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;, and in homes and communities. 

== History ==
In 1996, the [[National Safety Council]] established June as National Safety Month, aiming to increase awareness of the leading safety and health risks and ultimately decrease the number of unintentional injuries and deaths in the United States. 
[[File:NSM Wrigley Building.png|thumb|Wrigley Building in Chicago lit up green for National Safety Month in 2017]]
[https://facilityexecutive.com/2017/05/chicago-skyline-turning-green-for-national-safety-month/ In 2017]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://facilityexecutive.com/2017/05/chicago-skyline-turning-green-for-national-safety-month/|title=Chicago Skyline Turning Green For National Safety Month|last=McCandless|first=Mary Ellen|date=2017-05-30|work=Facility Executive - Creating Intelligent Buildings|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;, several buildings in the city of Chicago lit their building lights green to show their support for National Safety Month. 

== National Safety Month 2018 ==
The theme for National Safety Month in June 2018 is "[https://www.nsc.org/work-safety/get-involved/national-safety-month No 1 Gets Hurt]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nsc.org/work-safety/get-involved/national-safety-month|title=National Safety Month|website=www.nsc.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;." Each week in June correlates with a different safety topic:

=== Week 1 - Emergency Preparedness ===
Federal agencies, like [[United States Department of Homeland Security|Ready.gov]], the [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] and the [[Centers for Disease Control and Prevention]], provide resources for emergency preparedness. Some 10,000 cardiac arrests occur each year in the workplace. Only 45% of American workers have had first aid training and only 50 percent know where to locate an automated external defibrillator.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.safetyandhealthmagazine.com/articles/15886-more-than-half-of-workers-arent-trained-on-first-aid-cpr-survey|title=More than half of workers aren’t trained on first aid, CPR: survey|access-date=2018-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Week 2 - Wellness ===
The [[Institute Of Medicine|Institute of Medicine]] estimates that 50-70 million Americans chronically suffer from a sleep disorder. For an individual, sleep disorders can have a substantial impact in reducing quality of life, increasing the risk of other health problems such as heart disease and diabetes, and even reducing lifespan.

=== Week 3 - Falls ===
Falls are the leading cause of injury-related death for adults age 65 and older&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/HomeandRecreationalSafety/Falls/adultfalls.html|title=Important Facts about Falls  {{!}} Home and Recreational Safety {{!}} CDC Injury Center|date=2018-03-12|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Falls are also the leading cause of death in construction according to [[Occupational Safety and Health Administration|OSHA]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.osha.gov/stopfalls/|title=OSHA's Fall Prevention Campaign {{!}} Occupational Safety and Health Administration|website=www.osha.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Week 4 - Driving ===
Drowsy driving contributes to about 10 percent of all motor vehicle-related crashes, exceeding federal estimates by nearly eightfold, according to newly released research from the AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Treffers|first=R.|last2=Kubelka|first2=J.|last3=Fell|first3=J.C.|last4=Smith|first4=Ryan C.|last5=Turturici|first5=Marissa|date=2018-02-08|title=Prevalence of Drowsy Driving Crashes: Estimates from a Large-Scale Naturalistic Driving Study|url=http://aaafoundation.org/prevalence-drowsy-driving-crashes-estimates-large-scale-naturalistic-driving-study/|journal=AAA Foundation for Traffic Safety.|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== National Safety Month 2017 ==
The theme for National Safety Month in June 2017 was "Keep Each Other Safe," which underscored the role every individual plays in the effort to eliminate preventable deaths. Each week in June correlated with a different safety topic:

=== Week 1 - Stand up to Falls ===
One in three older adults falls each year. About 2.5 million nonfatal falls were treated in emergency departments in 2013&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cdc.gov/HomeandRecreationalSafety/Falls/adultfalls.html|title=Important Facts about Falls  {{!}} Home and Recreational Safety {{!}} CDC Injury Center|date=2018-03-12|website=www.cdc.gov|language=en-us|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Week 2 - Recharge to be in Charge ===
More than 70 million Americans suffer from sleep problems, according to research from the [[National Institutes of Health]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nhlbi.nih.gov/about/scientific-divisions/national-center-sleep-disorders-research|title=National Center on Sleep Disorders Research {{!}} National Heart, Lung, and Blood Institute (NHLBI)|website=www.nhlbi.nih.gov|language=en|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Sleep disorders, like [[sleep apnea]], can be serious enough to interfere with an employee's well-being. Approximately 13% of work injuries could be attributed to sleep problems&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Uehli|first=Katrin|last2=Mehta|first2=Amar J.|last3=Miedinger|first3=David|last4=Hug|first4=Kerstin|last5=Schindler|first5=Christian|last6=Holsboer-Trachsler|first6=Edith|last7=Leuppi|first7=Jörg D.|last8=Künzli|first8=Nino|date=2014-02|title=Sleep problems and work injuries: A systematic review and meta-analysis|url=https://www.smrv-journal.com/article/S1087-0792(13)00008-7/fulltext|journal=Sleep Medicine Reviews|language=English|volume=18|issue=1|pages=61–73|doi=10.1016/j.smrv.2013.01.004|issn=1087-0792}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Week 3 - Prepare for Active Shooters ===
An average of 70 people were wounded and 46 killed per year in active shooter events between 2014 and 2015&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://injuryfacts.nsc.org/home-and-community/safety-topics/firearms/|title=Firearms – Injury Facts|website=injuryfacts.nsc.org|language=en-US|access-date=2018-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

=== Week 4 - Don't just sit there ===
Overexertion continues to be a leading cause of injury over all age groups. It was the second leading reason that adults age 25-64 ended up in emergency departments in 2013, and the third leading cause for kids ages 10 and older, often from too-heavy backpacks, computers and gaming, and poor posture.

== Light Your City's Skyline Green ==
[[File:USG Building NSM.jpg|thumb|USG building of Chicago lit green for National Safety Month 2017]]
In 2017, the [[Building Owners and Managers Association]] of Chicago (BOMA) approved the Council's lighting request, and [[Blue Cross Blue Shield Tower|Blue Cross and Blue Shield of Illinois]] building, [[Prudential Headquarters|Prudential Plaza]] and [[Wrigley Building|The Wrigley Building]], 400-410 North Michigan Ave., Chicago, Ill., were lit green in June to show support for National Safety Month. The buildings participate in the BOMA Building Lighting Partner Program – an initiative to light up the skyline for various civic and philanthropic causes.

'''Nephrotic syndrome''' is a collection of symptoms due to [[kidney]] damage.&lt;ref name=NIH2014&gt;{{cite web|title=Nephrotic Syndrome in Adults|url=https://www.niddk.nih.gov/health-information/kidney-disease/nephrotic-syndrome-adults|website=National Institute of Diabetes and Digestive and Kidney Diseases|accessdate=9 November 2017|date=February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes [[proteinuria|protein in the urine]], [[hypoalbuminemia|low blood albumin levels]], [[hyperlipidemia|high blood lipids]], and significant [[edema|swelling]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Other symptoms may include weight gain, feeling tired, and foamy urine.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Complications may include [[blood clots]], infections, and [[high blood pressure]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt;

&lt;!-- Cause and diagnosis --&gt;
Causes include a number of kidney diseases such as [[focal segmental glomerulosclerosis]], [[membranous nephropathy]], and [[minimal change disease]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=Fer2018&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ferri|first1=Fred F.|title=Ferri's Clinical Advisor 2018 E-Book: 5 Books in 1|date=2017|publisher=Elsevier Health Sciences|isbn=9780323529570|page=889|url=https://books.google.ca/books?id=wGclDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA889|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may also occur as a complication of [[diabetes]] or [[lupus]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; The underlying mechanism typically involves damage to the [[glomeruli]] of the kidney.&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; Diagnosis is typically based on [[urinalysis|urine testing]] and sometimes a [[kidney biopsy]].&lt;ref name=NIH2014/&gt; It differs from [[nephritic syndrome]] in that there are no [[red blood cells]] in the urine.&lt;ref name=Fer2018/&gt;

==Signs and symptoms==
[[File:Gezichtsoedeem.jpg|thumb|right| Nephrotic syndrome is usually accompanied by retention of [[water]] and [[sodium]]. The degree to which this occurs can vary between slight edema in the eyelids that decreases during the day, to affecting the lower limbs, to generalized swelling, to full blown [[anasarca]].&lt;ref name=nelson&gt;{{cite book|last= Behrman|first= Richard E.|author2=Robert M Kliegman |author3= Hal B.

Nephrotic syndrome is characterized by large amounts of [[proteinuria]] (&gt;3.5 g per 1.73&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; body surface area per day,&lt;ref name="Electronic Module"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.som.tulane.edu/classware/pathology/medical_pathology/New_for_2001/renal/chap7.html | archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20081220233419/http://www.som.tulane.edu/classware/pathology/medical_pathology/New_for_2001/renal/chap7.html| archive-date= 2008-12-20|title= Electronic Learning Module for Kidney and Urinary Tract Diseases |work= |accessdate=2015-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; or &gt; 40&amp;nbsp;mg per square meter body surface area per hour in children), [[hypoalbuminemia]] (&lt; 2,5 g/dl), [[hyperlipidaemia]], and [[edema]] that begins in the face. [[Lipiduria]] (lipids in urine) can also occur, but is not essential for the diagnosis of nephrotic syndrome. [[Hyponatremia]] also occurs with a low [[fractional sodium excretion]].

Hyperlipidaemia is caused by two factors:
* Hypoproteinemia stimulates protein synthesis in the liver, resulting in the overproduction of [[lipoproteins]].
* Lipid catabolism is decreased due to lower levels of [[lipoprotein lipase]], the main enzyme involved in lipoprotein breakdown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hawaii.edu/medicine/pediatrics/pedtext/s13c02.html|title=Case Based Pediatrics Chapter|website=Hawaii.edu|accessdate=23 August 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cofactors, such as [[apolipoprotein C2]] may also be lost by increased filtration of proteins.

A few other characteristics seen in nephrotic syndrome are:
* The most common sign is [[excess fluid]] in the body due to the serum hypoalbuminemia. Lower serum oncotic pressure causes fluid to accumulate in the interstitial tissues.  Sodium and water retention aggravates the edema.  This may take several forms:
** Puffiness around the [[Human eyes|eyes]], characteristically in the morning.
** [[Edema|Pitting edema]] over the [[leg]]s.
** Fluid in the [[pleural cavity]] causing [[pleural effusion]]. More commonly associated with excess fluid is pulmonary edema.
** Fluid in the [[peritoneal cavity]] causing [[ascites]].
** Generalized edema throughout the body known as [[anasarca]].
* Most of the patients are normotensive but [[hypertension]] (rarely) may also occur.
* [[Anaemia]] (iron resistant microcytic hypochromic type) maybe present due to transferrin loss.
* [[Dyspnea]] may be present due to [[pleural effusion]] or due to diaphragmatic compression with ascites.
* [[Erythrocyte sedimentation rate]] is increased due to increased fibrinogen &amp; other plasma contents.
* Some patients may notice foamy or frothy [[urine]], due to a lowering of the [[surface tension]] by the severe [[proteinuria]]. Actual urinary complaints such as [[haematuria]] or [[oliguria]] are uncommon, though these are seen commonly in [[nephritic syndrome]].
* May have features of the underlying cause, such as the [[rash]] associated with [[systemic lupus erythematosus]], or the [[neuropathy]] associated with [[diabetes]].
* Examination should also exclude other causes of gross edema&amp;mdash;especially the [[cardiovascular]] and [[hepatic]] system.
* [[Muehrcke's nails]]; white lines (leukonychia) that extend all the way across the nail and lie parallel to the lunula&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Fitzpatrick's dermatology in general medicine.|year=2003|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=New York, NY [u.a.]|isbn=0-07-138076-0|page=659|edition=6th|editor=Freedberg, Irwin M. et.al}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This coefficient will be greater than 200–400&amp;nbsp;mg/mmol in nephrotic syndrome. This pronounced loss of proteins is due to an increase in glomerular permeability that allows proteins to pass into the urine instead of being retained in the blood. Under normal conditions a 24-hour urine sample should not exceed 80 milligrams or 10 milligrams per decilitre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = https://www.nlm.nih.gov/medlineplus/spanish/ency/article/003622.htm|title = Valores normales de proteína en orina de 24 horas|accessdate = 24 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* A hypoalbuminemia of less than 2.5 g/dL,&lt;ref name = "Conde" /&gt; that exceeds the ''hepatic clearance'' level, that is, [[protein synthesis]] in the liver is insufficient to increase the low blood protein levels.
* Edema is thought to be caused by two mechanisms. The first being hypoalbuminemia which lowers the [[oncotic pressure]] within vessels resulting in hypovolemia and subsequent activation of the [[renin–angiotensin system]] and thus retention of sodium and water. Additionally, it is thought that albumin causes a direct effect on the epithelial sodium channel (ENaC) on the principal cell that leads to the reabsorption of sodium and water. Nephrotic syndrome edema initially appears in parts of the lower body (such as the legs) and in the eyelids. In the advanced stages it also extends to the [[pleural cavity]] and [[peritoneum]] (ascites) and can even develop into a generalized anasarca. It has been recently seen that intrarenal sodium handling abnormality is related to Atrial Natriuretic Peptide resistance is associated with decreased abundance and altered subcellular localization of dopamine receptor in renal tubules.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author1=Cátia Fernandes-Cerqueira |author2=Benedita Sampaio-Maia |author3=Janete Quelhas-Santos |author4=Mónica Moreira-Rodrigues |author5=Liliana Simões-Silva |author6=Ana M.

* [[Hyperlipidaemia]] is caused by an increase in the synthesis of low and very low-density lipoproteins in the liver that are responsible for the transport of cholesterol and [[triglyceride]]s. There is also an increase in the hepatic synthesis of cholesterol.

== Pathophysiology ==
[[File:Gray1130.svg|thumb|Drawing of the renal glomerulus.]]The renal glomerulus filters the blood that arrives at the [[kidney]]. It is formed of capillaries with small pores that allow small molecules to pass through that have a molecular weight of less than 40,000 [[Atomic mass unit|Daltons]],&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://escuela.med.puc.cl/paginas/cursos/tercero/IntegradoTercero/Mec231_38.html|title=Apuntes de fisiopatología de sistemas|accessdate=8 Sep 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080908021010/http://escuela.med.puc.cl/paginas/Cursos/tercero/IntegradoTercero/Mec231_38.html|archivedate=2008-09-08|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; but not larger macromolecules such as proteins.

In nephrotic syndrome, the glomeruli are affected by an [[inflammation]] or a ''hyalinization'' (the formation of a homogenous crystalline material within cells) that allows proteins such as [[albumin]], [[antithrombin]] or the [[immunoglobulin]]s to pass through the cell membrane and appear in urine.&lt;ref name="scielo" /&gt;

Albumin is the main protein in the blood that is able to maintain an [[oncotic pressure]], which prevents the leakage of fluid into the extracellular medium and the subsequent formation of edemas.

As a response to hypoproteinemia the liver commences a compensatory mechanism involving the synthesis of proteins, such as [[alpha-2 macroglobulin]] and [[lipoprotein]]s.&lt;ref name="scielo" /&gt; An increase in the latter can cause the [[hyperlipidemia]]  associated with this syndrome.

== Causes  ==
[[File:Glomerulus pas.JPG|thumb|Histological image of a normal kidney glomerulus. It is possible to see a glomerulus in the centre of the image surrounded by renal tubules.]]
Nephrotic syndrome has many causes and may either be the result of a glomerular disease that can be either limited to the kidney, called ''primary'' nephrotic syndrome (primary [[glomerulonephrosis]]), or a condition that affects the kidney and other parts of the body, called ''secondary'' nephrotic syndrome.

=== Primary glomerulonephrosis ===
Primary causes of nephrotic syndrome are usually described by their [[histology]]:&lt;ref&gt;
{{cite web|url=http://www.senefro.org/modules.php?name=subsection&amp;idsection=3&amp;idsubsection=264|title=Descripción histológica de las glomerulonefritis ideopáticas|accessdate =8 Sep 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Minimal change disease]] (MCD): is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in children. It owes its name to the fact that the [[nephron]]s appear normal when viewed with an [[optical microscope]] as the lesions are only visible using an [[electron microscope]].  Another symptom is a pronounced proteinuria. 
* [[Focal segmental glomerulosclerosis]] (FSGS): is the most common cause of nephrotic syndrome in adults.&lt;ref name="uptodate" /&gt; It is characterized by the appearance of tissue [[scar]]ring in the glomeruli. The term ''focal'' is used as some of the glomeruli have scars, while others appear intact; the term ''segmental'' refers to the fact that only part of the glomerulus suffers the damage.
* [[Membranous glomerulonephritis]] (MGN): The inflammation of the glomerular membrane causes increased leaking in the kidney. It is not clear why this condition develops in most people, although an auto-immune mechanism is suspected.&lt;ref name="uptodate"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uptodate.com/contents/the-nephrotic-syndrome-beyond-the-basics |title=Patient information: The nephrotic syndrome (Beyond the Basics) |accessdate =2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Membranoproliferative glomerulonephritis]] (MPGN): is the inflammation of the glomeruli along with the deposit of [[antibody|antibodies]] in their membranes, which makes filtration difficult.
* [[Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis]] (RPGN): (Usually presents as a nephritic syndrome) A patient's glomeruli are present in a ''crescent moon'' shape. It is characterized clinically by a rapid decrease in the glomerular filtration rate (GFR) by at least 50% over a short period, usually from a few days to 3 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://emedicine.medscape.com/article/240457-overview|title = Rapidly progressive glomerulonephritis|author = James W Lohr, MD|accessdate = 2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

They are considered to be "[[Diagnosis of exclusion|diagnoses of exclusion]]", i.e. they are diagnosed only after secondary causes have been excluded.

=== Secondary glomerulonephrosis ===
[[File:Diabetic glomerulosclerosis (8) PAM.jpg|thumb|235px|Diabetic glomerulonephritis in a patient with nephrotic syndrome.]]
Secondary causes of nephrotic syndrome have the same histologic patterns as the primary causes, though they may exhibit some difference suggesting a secondary cause, such as [[inclusion bodies]].&lt;ref name="epidemiología" /&gt; They are usually described by the underlying cause.
* [[Diabetic nephropathy]]: is a complication that occurs in some [[diabetes|diabetics]]. Excess blood sugar accumulates in the kidney causing them to become inflamed and unable to carry out their normal function. This leads to the leakage of proteins into the urine. 
* [[Systemic lupus erythematosus]]: this [[autoimmune disease]] can affect a number of organs, among them the kidney, due to the deposit of [[immune complex|immunocomplexes]] that are typical to this disease. The disease can also cause ''[[lupus nephritis]]''.
* [[Sarcoidosis]]: This disease does not usually affect the kidney but, on occasions, the accumulation of inflammatory [[granuloma]]s (collection of [[immune cell]]s) in the glomeruli can lead to nephrotic syndrome. 
* [[Syphilis]]: kidney damage can occur during the secondary stage of this disease (between 2 and 8 weeks from onset).
* [[Hepatitis B]]: certain [[antigen]]s present during hepatitis can accumulate in the kidneys and damage them.
* [[Sjögren's syndrome]]: this autoimmune disease causes the deposit of immunocomplexes in the glomeruli, causing them to become inflamed, this is the same mechanism as occurs in systemic lupus erythematosus.
* [[HIV]]: the virus's antigens provoke an obstruction in the glomerular capillary's lumen that alters normal kidney function.
* [[Amyloidosis]]: the deposit of ''amyloid substances'' (proteins with anomalous structures) in the glomeruli modifying their shape and function.
* [[Multiple myeloma]]: renal impairment is caused by the accumulation and precipitation of light chains, which form casts in the distal tubules, resulting in renal obstruction. In addition, myeloma light chains are also directly toxic on proximal renal tubules, further adding to renal dysfunction.
* [[Vasculitis]]: inflammation of the blood vessels at a glomerular level impedes the normal blood flow and damages the kidney.
* [[Cancer]]: as happens in myeloma, the invasion of the glomeruli by cancerous cells disturbs their normal functioning.
* [[Genetic disorder]]s: [[congenital nephrotic syndrome]] is a rare [[genetic disorder]]  in which the protein [[nephrin]], a component of the glomerular filtration barrier, is altered.
* [[Drug]]s ( e.g. gold salts, [[penicillin]], [[captopril]]):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cepvi.com/medicina/enfermedades/sindrome_nefrotico4.shtml|title = Fármacos que pueden producir síndrome nefrótico |accessdate =8 Sep 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; gold salts can cause a more or less important loss of proteins in urine as a consequence of metal accumulation. Penicillin is nephrotoxic in patients with kidney failure and captopril can aggravate proteinuria.

== Diagnosis ==
[[File:Urinbecher.jpg|thumb|200px|right| [[Urinalysis]] will be able to detect high levels of proteins and occasionally microscopic [[haematuria]].]]
[[File:Ultrasonography of kidney with nephrotic syndrome.jpg|thumb|[[Renal ultrasonography|Ultrasound of a kidney]] with nephrotic syndrome. There is a hyperechoic kidney without demarcation of the cortex and medulla.&lt;ref name=Hansen2015&gt;Content initially copied from: {{cite journal|last1=Hansen|first1=Kristoffer|last2=Nielsen|first2=Michael|last3=Ewertsen|first3=Caroline|title=Ultrasonography of the Kidney: A Pictorial Review|journal=Diagnostics|volume=6|issue=1|year=2015|pages=2|issn=2075-4418|doi=10.3390/diagnostics6010002}} [https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/ (CC-BY 4.0)]&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Along with obtaining a complete [[medical record|medical history]], a series of [[biochemical]] tests are required in order to arrive at an accurate diagnosis that verifies the presence of the illness. In addition, imaging of the kidneys (for structure and presence of two kidneys) is sometimes carried out, and/or a biopsy of the kidneys. The first test will be a urinalysis to test for high levels of proteins,&lt;ref name="mapfre"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.mapfre.es/salud/es/cinformativo/sindrome-nefrotico.shtml|title = Nefrología y urología|accessdate = 12 Sep 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; as a healthy subject excretes an insignificant amount of protein in their urine. The test will involve a 24-hour bedside urinary total protein estimation. The urine sample is tested for [[proteinuria]] (&gt;3.5 g per 1.73 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; per 24 hours). It is also examined for [[urinary casts]], which are more a feature of active nephritis. Next a blood screen, [[comprehensive metabolic panel]] (CMP) will look for [[hypoalbuminemia]]: [[albumin]] levels of ≤2.5 g/dL (normal=3.5-5 g/dL). Then a [[Renal function#creatinine clearance|Creatinine Clearance C&lt;sub&gt;Cr&lt;/sub&gt;]] test will evaluate renal function particularly the glomerular filtration capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.urovirtual.net/paciente/saber/rinyones/articulo9.asp|title = El diagnóstico del síndrome nefrótico|accessdate = 12 Sep 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Creatinine]] formation is a result of the breakdown of muscular tissue, it is transported in the blood and eliminated in urine. Measuring the concentration of [[organic compounds]] in both liquids evaluates the capacity of the glomeruli to filter blood. [[Electrolytes]] and [[urea]] levels may also be analysed at the same time as [[creatinine]] (EUC test) in order to evaluate renal function. 
A lipid profile will also be carried out as high levels of [[cholesterol]] ([[hypercholesterolemia]]), specifically elevated [[Low density lipoprotein|LDL]], usually with concomitantly elevated [[Very low density lipoprotein|VLDL]], is indicative of nephrotic syndrome.

A kidney biopsy may also be used as a more specific and invasive test method. A study of a sample's [[anatomical pathology]] may then allow the identification of the type of glomerulonephritis involved.&lt;ref name="mapfre" /&gt; However, this procedure is usually reserved for adults as the majority of children suffer from minimum change disease that has a remission rate of 95% with [[corticosteroid]]s.&lt;ref name="biopsia"&gt;{{cite web |url = http://www.scielo.cl/scielo.php?pid=S0370-41062006000300011&amp;script=sci_arttext|title = Indicaciones de la biospsia renal en niños|accessdate = 2008-09-14 |author1=Voguel S, Andrea |author2=Azócar P, Marta |author3=Nazal Ch, Vilma |author4=Salas del C, Paulina }}&lt;/ref&gt; A biopsy is usually only indicated for children that are ''corticosteroid resistant'' as the majority suffer from focal and segmental glomeruloesclerosis.&lt;ref name="biopsia" /&gt;

Further investigations are indicated if the cause is not clear including analysis of [[auto-immune]] markers ([[Anti-nuclear antibody|ANA]], [[Antistreptolysin O titre|ASOT]], [[C3 (complement)|C3]], [[cryoglobulin]]s, [[Serum protein electrophoresis|serum electrophoresis]]), or [[Medical ultrasonography|ultrasound]] of the whole abdomen.

===Classification===

&lt;/center&gt;

===Differential diagnosis===
Some symptoms that are present in nephrotic syndrome, such as edema and proteinuria, also appear in other illnesses. Therefore, other pathologies need to be excluded in order to arrive at a definitive diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elizalde.gov.ar/area_medica/Normas/nuevas/nefrotico.doc  |title=Diagnóstico diferencial en el síndrome nefrótico  |accessdate=2008-09-14  |deadurl=bot: unknown  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090306092804/http://www.elizalde.gov.ar/area_medica/Normas/nuevas/nefrotico.doc  |archivedate=2009-03-06  |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Edema: in addition to nephrotic syndrome there are two other disorders that often present with edema; these are [[heart failure]] and [[liver failure]].&lt;ref name="manual"&gt;{{cite book | last = Harold Friedman| first = H| publisher = Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins| title = Problem-oriented Medical Diagnosis| edition = Seventh| year = 2001| isbn = 0-7817-2909-2| chapter = General problems | chapterurl = | pages = 3 and 4.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Congestive heart failure can cause [[water retention (medicine)|liquid retention]] in tissues as a consequence of the decrease in the strength of ventricular contractions. The liquid is initially concentrated in the ankles but it subsequently becomes generalized and is called anasarca.&lt;ref name="cepvi"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cepvi.com/medicina/enfermedades/insuficiencia_cardiaca.shtml|title = El edema en la insuficiencia cardíaca|accessdate = 2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients with congestive heart failure also experience an abnormal swelling of the heart [[cardiomegaly]], which aids in making a correct diagnosis. Jugular venous pressure can also be elevated and it might be possible to hear heart murmurs. An echocardiogram is the preferred investigation method for these symptoms. Liver failure caused by [[cirrhosis]], hepatitis and other conditions such as alcoholism, IV drug use or some hereditary diseases can lead to swelling in the lower extremities and the abdominal cavity. Other accompanying symptoms include [[jaundice]], dilated veins over umbilicus ([[caput medusae]]), scratch marks (due to widespread itching, known as [[pruritus]]), enlarged spleen, [[spider angiomata]], encephalopathy, bruising, nodular liver and anomalies in the liver function tests.&lt;ref name="cardiología"&gt;{{cite book | last = Goldman| first = Lee|author2=Braunwald, Eugene| publisher = Harcourt| title = Cardiología en atención primaria| year = 2000| isbn = 8481744328| chapter = Edemas| pages = 114–117.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Less frequently symptoms associated with the administration of certain pharmaceutical drugs have to be discounted. These drugs promote the retention of liquid in the extremities such as occurs with [[Non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug|NSAIs]], some [[antihypertensive drug]]s, the [[adrenal gland|adrenal]] corticosteroids and sex [[hormone]]s.&lt;ref name="cardiología" /&gt;
[[Acute (medicine)|Acute]] [[Hypervolemia|fluid overload]] can cause edema in someone with kidney failure. These people are known to have kidney failure, and have either drunk too much or missed their dialysis. In addition, when [[Metastasis|Metastatic cancer]] spreads to the lungs or abdomen it causes effusions and fluid accumulation due to obstruction of lymphatic vessels and veins, as well as serous exudation.
* Proteinuria: the loss of proteins from the urine is caused by many pathological agents and infection by these agents has to be ruled out before it can be certain that a patient has nephrotic syndrome. [[Multiple myeloma]] can cause a proteinuria that is not accompanied by hypoalbuminemia, which is an important aid in making a differential diagnosis;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:MKktIJ4-hrQJ:www.revistanefrologia.com/mostrarfile.asp%3FID%3D672|title = La proteinuria en el mieloma múltiple|accessdate = 2008-09-14|author = Rivera, F |author2= Egea, J.J|author3= Jiménez del Cerro, L.A|author4= Olivares, J }}&lt;/ref&gt; other potential causes of proteinuria include [[asthenia]], weight loss or [[bone pain]]. In [[diabetes mellitus]] there is an association between increases in [[glycated hemoglobin]] levels and the appearance of proteinuria.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.bvs.sld.cu/revistas/end/vol9_2_98/end05298.htm|title = Relación de la proteinuria con el nivel de hemoglobina glicosilada en los diabéticos|accessdate = 2008-09-14 |author = Bustillo Solano, Emilio}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other causes are [[amyloidosis]] and certain other allergic and infectious diseases.

== Complications ==
Nephrotic syndrome can be associated with a series of complications that can affect an individual's health and quality of life:&lt;ref name="scielo"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://scielo.sld.cu/scielo.php?script=sci_arttext&amp;pid=S0034-75311999000400010|title = Complicaciones agudas del síndrome nefrótico|accessdate = 11 Sep 2008|author = Durán Álvarez, Sandalio}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Thrombosis|Thromboembolic]] disorders: particularly those caused by a decrease in blood antithrombin III levels due to leakage. Antithrombin III counteracts the action of [[thrombin]]. Thrombosis usually occurs in the renal veins although it can also occur in arteries. Treatment is with oral anticoagulants (not heparin as heparin acts via anti-thrombin 3 which is lost in the proteinuria so it will be ineffective.) Hypercoagulopathy due to extravasation of fluid from the blood vessels (edema) is also a risk for venous thrombosis.
* [[Infection]]s: The increased susceptibility of patients to infections can be a result of the leakage of immunoglobulins from the blood, the loss of proteins in general and the presence of oedematous fluid (which acts as a breeding ground for infections). The most common infection is [[peritonitis]], followed by lung, skin and urinary infections, [[meningoencephalitis]] and in the most serious cases [[septicaemia]]. The most notable of the causative organisms are ''[[Streptococcus pneumoniae]]'' and ''[[Haemophilus influenzae]]''.
* [[Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis]] can develop where there is ascites present. This is a frequent development in children but very rarely found in adults.&lt;ref name="Ruiz"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ruiz |first1=S |last2=Soto |first2=S |last3=Rodado |first3=R |last4=Alcaraz |first4=F |last5=López Guillén |first5=E |title=[Spontaneous bacterial peritonitis as form of presentation of idiophatic nephrotic syndrome in a black adult]. |journal=Anales de medicina interna (Madrid, Spain : 1984) |date=September 2007 |volume=24 |issue=9 |pages=442-4 |pmid=18198954}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Acute [[kidney failure]] due to [[hypovolemia]]: the loss of vascular fluid into the tissues (edema) produces a decreased blood supply to the kidneys that causes a loss of kidney function. Thus it is a tricky task to get rid of excess fluid in the body while maintaining circulatory euvolemia.
* [[Pulmonary edema]]: the loss of proteins from blood plasma and the consequent fall in oncotic pressure causes an abnormal accumulation of liquid in the lungs causing [[Hypoxia (medical)|hypoxia]] and [[dyspnoea]].
* [[Hypothyroidism]]: deficiency of the [[thyroglobulin]] transport protein thyroxin (a glycoprotein that is rich in [[iodine]] and is found in the [[thyroid]] gland) due to decreased thyroid binding globulin.
* [[Vitamin D deficiency]] can occur. Vitamin D binding protein is lost. 
* [[Hypocalcaemia]]: lack of [[calcifediol|25-hydroxycholecalciferol]] (the way that [[vitamin D]] is stored in the body). As vitamin D regulates the amount of calcium present in the blood, a decrease in its concentration will lead to a decrease in blood calcium levels. It may be significant enough to cause [[tetany]]. Hypocalcaemia may be relative; calcium levels should be adjusted based on the albumin level and ionized calcium levels should be checked. 
* Microcytic [[hypochromic]]  [[anaemia]]: [[iron]] deficiency caused by the loss of [[ferritin]] (compound used to store iron in the body). It is iron-therapy resistant.
* Protein [[malnutrition]]: this occurs when the amount of protein that is lost in the urine is greater than that ingested, this leads to a negative [[nitrogen]] balance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Zollo| first = Anthony J| publisher = Elsevier España| title = Medicina interna. Secretos| edition = Cuarta| year = 2005| isbn = 8481748862| chapter = Nefrología| page = 283}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="balancenitrógeno" /&gt;
* [[Growth retardation]]: can occur in cases of relapse or resistance to therapy. Causes of growth retardation are protein deficiency from the loss of protein in urine, [[Anorexia (symptom)|anorexia]] (reduced protein intake), and steroid therapy (catabolism).
* [[Cushing's syndrome]]

== Treatment ==
The treatment of nephrotic syndrome can be symptomatic or can directly address the injuries caused to the kidney.

=== Symptomatic  ===
The objective of this treatment is to treat the imbalances brought about by the illness:&lt;ref name="libro online"&gt;{{cite book |last= Curtis|first= Michael J.|enlaceauthor= |author2= Page, Clive P.|author3= Walker, Michael J.A|author4= Hoffman, Brian B. |publisher= Harcourt|title= Farmacología integrada|year= 1998 |isbn= 8481743402|chapter= Fisiopatología y enfermedades renales }}&lt;/ref&gt; edema, hypoalbuminemia, hyperlipemia, hypercoagulability and infectious complications.
* '''Edema''': a return to an unswollen state is the prime objective of this treatment of nephrotic syndrome. It is carried out through the combination of a number of recommendations:
** Rest: depending on the seriousness of the edema and taking into account the risk of thrombosis caused by prolonged bed rest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.unizar.es/med_naturista/Ejercicio/reposo.pdf|title = El reposo prolongado|author = Saz Peiro, Pablo|accessdate =8 Sep 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
** [[Medical nutrition therapy]]: based on a [[Diet (nutrition)|diet]] with the correct energy intake and balance of proteins that will be used in synthesis processes and not as a source of calories. A total of 35 kcal/kg body weight/day is normally recommended.&lt;ref name="Dietoterapia"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nutrar.com/detalle.asp?ID=6135  |title=Dietoterapia del síndrome nefrótico  |accessdate=8 Sep 2008  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090122133712/http://www.nutrar.com/detalle.asp?ID=6135  |archivedate=2009-01-22  |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; This diet should also comply with two more requirements: the first is to not consume more than 1 [[gram|g]] of protein/kg body weight/ day,&lt;ref name = "Dietoterapia" /&gt; as a greater amount could increase the degree of proteinuria and cause a negative nitrogen balance.&lt;ref name="balancenitrógeno"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://angiejr3.tripod.com/id4.html|title = Balance de nitrógeno y equilibrio nitrogenado|quote = It occurs during renal pathologies, during fasting, in eating disorders or during heavy physical exercise. |accessdate =8 Sep 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Patients are usually recommended lean cuts of meat, fish, and poultry. The second guideline requires that the amount of water ingested is not greater than the level of [[fluid balance|diuresis]]. In order to facilitate this the consumption of salt must also be controlled, as this contributes to water retention. It is advisable to restrict the ingestion of sodium to 1 or 2 g/day, which means that salt cannot be used in cooking and salty foods should also be avoided.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.botanical-online.com/alimentosconmuchasal.htm|title = Lista de alimentos ricos en sodio|accessdate =8 Sep 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foods high in sodium include seasoning blends (garlic salt, Adobo, season salt, etc.) canned soups, canned vegetables containing salt, luncheon meats including turkey, ham, bologna, and salami, prepared foods, fast foods, soy sauce, ketchup, and salad dressings.  On food labels, compare milligrams of sodium to calories per serving.  Sodium should be less than or equal to calories per serving.
** [[Pharmacology|Medication]]: The pharmacological treatment of edema is based on the [[Prescription (Pharmacology)|prescription]] of [[diuretic]] [[drug]]s (especially [[loop diuretics]], such as [[furosemide]]). In severe cases of edema (or in cases with physiological repercussions, such as [[scrotum|scrotal]], [[Foreskin|preputial]] or [[urethra]]l edema) or in patients with one of a number of severe infections (such as [[sepsis]] or [[pleural effusion]]), the diuretics can be administered [[Intravenous therapy|intravenously]]. This occurs where the risk from plasmatic expansion&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.udomfyc.org/descarga/sesiones/2006y7/fluidoterapia.pdf|title = Fluidoterapia: tipos de expansores|quote = Plasma expanders are natural or synthetic substances (dextran, albumin...), that are able to retain liquid in the vascular space.|accessdate = 8 Sep 2008|deadurl = yes|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080920190812/http://www.udomfyc.org/descarga/sesiones/2006y7/fluidoterapia.pdf|archivedate = 2008-09-20|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; is considered greater than the risk of severe hypovolemia, which can be caused by the strong diuretic action of intravenous treatment. The procedure is the following: 
:# Analyse [[haemoglobin]] and [[haematocrit]] levels.
:# A solution of 25% albumin is used that is administered for only 4 hours in order to avoid pulmonary edema.
:# Haemoglobin and haematocrit levels are analysed again: if the haematocrit value is less than the initial value (a sign of correct expansion) the diuretics are administered for at least 30 minutes. If the haematocrit level is greater than the initial one this is a contraindication for the use of diuretics as they would increase said value. 
:It may be necessary to give a patient [[potassium]] or require a change in dietary habits if the diuretic drug causes [[hypokalaemia]] as a side effect.

* '''Hypoalbuminemia''': is treated using the medical nutrition therapy described as a treatment for edema. It includes a moderate intake of foods rich in animal proteins.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.cun.es/areadesalud/tu-salud/nutricion-y-salud/alimentos-ricos-en-proteinas/ |title = Lista de alimentos ricos en proteínas|quote = Expressed as grams per 100 g of food.|accessdate =8 Sep 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Hyperlipidaemia''': depending of the seriousness of the condition it can be treated with medical nutrition therapy as the only treatment or combined with drug therapy. The ingestion of cholesterol should be less than 300&amp;nbsp;mg/day,&lt;ref name = "Dietoterapia" /&gt; which will require a switch to foods that are low in [[saturated fat]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tusalud.com.mx/221005.htm |title=Sustitución de los alimentos ricos en grasas de la dieta |quote=Organizations in the US recommend that no more than 30% of total daily calorie intake is from fats. |accessdate= 8 Sep 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080212091444/http://www.tusalud.com.mx/221005.htm |archivedate=February 12, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Avoid saturated fats such as butter, cheese, fried foods, fatty cuts of red meat, egg yolks, and poultry skin.  Increase unsaturated fat intake, including olive oil, canola oil, peanut butter, avocadoes, fish and nuts. In cases of severe hyperlipidaemia that are unresponsive to nutrition therapy the use of [[hypolipidemic agent|hypolipidemic]] drugs, may be necessary (these include [[statin]]s, [[fibrate]]s and resinous sequesters of [[bile acid]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Martín Zurro|first= Armando |publisher= Elsevier España|title= Compendio de atención primaria: Conceptos, organización y práctica clínica|edition= Segunda|year= 2005|isbn= 8481748161|pages= 794|chapter= Hipolipemiante, diuréticos, estatina. }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Thrombophilia''': low molecular weight [[heparin]] (LMWH) may be appropriate for use as a [[prophylactic]] in some circumstances, such as in asymptomatic patients that have no history of suffering from thromboembolism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hvn.es/servicios_asistenciales/medicina_interna/descargas/EstadosdeHipercoagulabilidad_20062007.pdf  |title=Profilaxis de los fenómenos tromboembólicos  |accessdate=2008-09-14  |author=Jiménez Alonso, Juan }}{{dead link|date=May 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="pmid17599972"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Glassock RJ |title=Prophylactic anticoagulation in nephrotic syndrome: a clinical conundrum |journal=J.

During this time and if the [[prothrombin time]] is within its [[therapeutic range]] (between 2 and 3),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.iqb.es/cbasicas/farma/farma05/analisis/i1.htm|title = Rango Internacional Normalizado (INR)|accessdate = 2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; it may be possible to suspend the LMWH while maintaining the OACs for at least 6 months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fisterra.com/guias2/tao.asp  |title=Tratamiento de la hipercoagulabilidad  |accessdate=2008-09-14  |deadurl=yes  |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080915104946/http://www.fisterra.com/guias2/tao.asp  |archivedate=2008-09-15  |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''Infectious complications''': an appropriate course of [[antibacterial]] drugs can be taken according to the infectious agent.
In addition to these key imbalances, vitamin D and calcium are also taken orally in case the alteration of vitamin D causes a severe hypocalcaemia, this treatment has the goal of restoring physiological levels of calcium in the patient.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.fisterra.com/guias2/hipocalcemia.asp|title = Tratamiento de la hipocalcemia|accessdate = 2008-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Achieving better blood glucose level control if the patient is diabetic.
* [[Blood pressure]] control. [[ACE inhibitors]] are the drug of choice. Independent of their blood pressure lowering effect, they have been shown to decrease protein loss.

===Kidney damage ===
The treatment of kidney damage may reverse or delay the progression of the disease.&lt;ref name="libro online" /&gt; Kidney damage is treated by prescribing drugs:
* '''[[Corticosteroids]]''': the result is a decrease in the proteinuria and the risk of infection as well as a resolution of the edema.&lt;ref name="pmid17943754"&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hahn D, Hodson EM, Willis NS, Craig JC|first=|date=|year=2015|editor1-last=|editor1-first=|title=Corticosteroid therapy for nephrotic syndrome in children|journal=Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews|volume=|issue=|pages=CD001533|doi=10.1002/14651858.CD001533.pub5|pmid=25785660|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prednisone]] is usually prescribed at a dose of 60&amp;nbsp;mg/m² of body surface area/day in a first treatment for 4–8 weeks. After this period the dose is reduced to 40&amp;nbsp;mg/m² for a further 4 weeks. Patients suffering a relapse or children are treated with prednisolone 2&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day till urine becomes negative for protein. Then, 1.5&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day for 4 weeks. Frequent relapses treated by: [[cyclophosphamide]] or nitrogen mustard or ciclosporin or [[levamisole]]. Patients can respond to prednisone in a number of different ways:
** Corticosteroid sensitive patient or early steroid-responder: the subject responds to the corticosteroids in the first 8 weeks of treatment. This is demonstrated by a strong diuresis and the disappearance of edemas, and also by a negative test for proteinuria in three urine samples taken during the night.
** Corticosteroid resistant patient or late steroid-responder: the proteinuria persists after the 8-week treatment. The lack of response is indicative of the seriousness of the glomerular damage, which could develop into chronic kidney failure.
** Corticosteroid intolerant patient: complications such as [[hypertension]] appear, patients gain a lot of weight and can develop aseptic or [[avascular necrosis]] of the [[hip]] or [[knee]],&lt;ref&gt;According to MedlinePlus, avascular necrosis is the ''death of the bone caused by insufficient blood supply to the bone.&lt;/ref&gt; [[cataract]]s and thrombotic phenomena and/or [[embolism]]s.
** Corticosteroid dependent patient: proteinuria appears when the dose of corticosteroid is decreased or there is a relapse in the first two weeks after treatment is completed.
The susceptibility testing in vitro to glucocorticoids on patient's peripheral blood mononuclear cells is associated with the incidence of not optimal clinical responses: the most sensitive patients in vitro have shown a higher incidence of corticodependence, while the most resistant patients in vitro showed a higher incidence of ineffective therapy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Cuzzoni |first1=E |last2=De Iudicibus |first2=S |last3= Stocco |first3=G |last4=Favretto |first4=D |year=2016 |title=In vitro sensitivity to methyl-prednisolone is associated with clinical response in pediatric idiopathic nephrotic syndrome. |journal=Clin Pharmacol Ther |volume=100 |pages=268–74 |doi=10.1002/cpt.372 |pmid=27007551}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Immunosupressor]]s ([[cyclophosphamide]]): only indicated in recurring nephrotic syndrome in corticosteroid dependent or intolerant patients. In the first two cases the proteinuria has to be negated before treatment with the immunosuppressor can begin, which involves a prolonged treatment with prednisone. The negation of the proteinuria indicates the exact moment when treatment with cyclophosphamide can begin. The treatment is continued for 8 weeks at a dose of 3&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day, the immunosuppression is halted after this period. In order to be able to start this treatment the patient should not be suffering from [[neutropenia]] nor anaemia, which would cause further complications. A possible [[Adverse drug reaction|side effect]] of the cyclophosphamide is [[Baldness|alopecia]]. [[Complete blood count]] tests are carried out during the treatment in order to give advance warning of a possible infection.

== Epidemiology ==
Nephrotic syndrome can affect any age, although it is mainly found in adults with a ratio of adults to children of 26 to 1.&lt;ref name = "epi"&gt;{{cite book |last1= Borrego R.|first1= Jaime |last2= Montero C., |first2= Orlando|publisher= Corporación para investigaciones biológicas|title= Nefrología: Fundamentos de medicina|edition= Cuarta|year= 2003|isbn= 9589400639|page= 340}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The syndrome presents in different ways in the two groups: the most frequent glomerulopathy in children is [[minimal change disease]] (66% of cases), followed by focal segmental glomerulosclerosis (8%) and mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis (6%).&lt;ref name="epidemiología"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://webcache.googleusercontent.com/search?q=cache:hsqMptZ7b3AJ:sabanet.unisabana.edu.co/medicina/semestre7/medinterna_I/guis2005-2/SINDROMES%2520GLOMERULARES%25202.doc|title = Frecuencia de las glomerulonefritis y causas de las glomerulonefritis secundarias|accessdate = 8 Sep 2008}}{{Dead link|date=August 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; In adults the most common disease is mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis (30-40%), followed by focal and segmental glomeruloesclerosis (15-25%) and minimal change disease (20%). The latter usually presents as secondary and not primary as occurs in children. Its main cause is diabetic nephropathy.&lt;ref name="epidemiología" /&gt; It usually presents in a patient's 40s or 50s.
Of the glomerulonephritis cases approximately 60% to 80% are primary, while the remainder are secondary.&lt;ref name="epi" /&gt;

There are also differences in epidemiology between the sexes, the disease is more common in men than in women by a ratio of 2 to 1.&lt;ref name="epi" /&gt;

The [[Epidemiology|epidemiological]] data also reveals information regarding the most common way that symptoms develop in patients with nephrotic syndrome:&lt;ref name="epi" /&gt; spontaneous remission occurs in up to 20% or 30% of cases during the first year of the illness. However, this improvement is not definitive as some 50% to 60% of patients die and / or develop chronic renal failure 6 to 14 years after this remission. On the other hand, between 10% and 20% of patients have continuous episodes of remissions and [[relapse]]s without dying or jeopardizing their kidney. The main causes of death are cardiovascular, as a result of the chronicity of the syndrome, and thromboembolic accidents.

== Prognosis ==
The prognosis for nephrotic syndrome under treatment is generally good although this depends on the underlying cause, the age of the patient and their response to treatment. It is usually good in children, because [[minimal change disease]] responds very well to [[steroids]] and does not cause [[chronic renal failure]]. Any relapses that occur become less frequent over time;&lt;ref name="aeped"&gt;{{cite web|url = http://www.aeped.es/infofamilia/temas/sdnefrotico2.htm|title = Pronóstico de la enfermedad|accessdate = 2016-05-21|author = Guerrero Fernández, J }}&lt;/ref&gt; the opposite occurs with [[mesangiocapillary glomerulonephritis]], in which the kidney fails within three years of the disease developing, making [[dialysis]] necessary and subsequent [[kidney transplant]].&lt;ref name="aeped" /&gt; In addition children under the age of 5 generally have a poorer prognosis than prepubescents, as do adults older than 30 years of age as they have a greater risk of kidney failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url = http://bvs.sld.cu/revistas/med/vol34_3_95/med02395.htm|title = Síndrome nefrótico idiopático: diagnóstico histológico por biopsia renal percutanea|date= 1995 |accessdate = 2016-05-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other causes such as [[focal segmental glomerulosclerosis]] frequently lead to [[chronic kidney disease|end stage renal disease]]. Factors associated with a poorer prognosis in these cases include level of [[proteinuria]], [[blood pressure]] control and kidney function ([[Glomerular filtration rate|GFR]]).

Without treatment nephrotic syndrome has a very bad prognosis especially ''rapidly progressing glomerulonephritis'', which leads to acute kidney failure after a few months.

== Notable cases ==
[[Jonah Lomu]] was diagnosed with nephrotic syndrome in 1995. The legendary [[All Blacks]] rugby union player managed to continue to play throughout his illness, though he occasionally took time off for treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Jonah Lomu dies of heart attack, aged 40: follow latest as tributes paid to New Zealand rugby great|url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/sport/rugbyunion/international/newzealand/12002268/Jonah-Lomu-dies-age-40-follow-latest-as-tributes-paid-to-New-Zealand-rugby-great-live.html|website = Telegraph.co.uk|accessdate = 2015-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He received a kidney transplant in 2004; however, this transplant failed in 2011.

The '''Partnership for Child Development''' (PCD) is a [[research]] and [[technical assistance]] group based at [[Imperial College London]] that seeks to improve [[School health services|health and nutrition in school-age children]] and youth in low-income countries, thereby improving their education outcomes. PCD was formed in 1992 at the [[University of Oxford]] to bridge gaps between academia, funding bodies and the education and health sectors in low-income countries.&lt;ref&gt;Nokes C (1996), Journal of Biosocial Science [http://journals.cambridge.org/download.phpfile=%2FJBS%2FJBS28_04%2FS0021932000022525a.pdf&amp;code=a6ed33fdec9dafba4579326df0a7aa58] A healthy body and a healthy mind? : The relationship between ill-health and cognitive function in school-age children. Accessed 28 March 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

__TOC__

==History==
Based on a growing evidence base for the beneficial nature of [[anthelminthic|antihelminthic]] treatment (deworming) in the early 1990s, the Partnership for Child Development was formed by the [[United Nations Development Programme]] and the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] within the Scientific Coordinating Centre at the University of Oxford.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=A. Cerami &amp; K.S. Warren, Drugs, Parasitology Today, Vol. 10|url=http://ac.els-cdn.com/0169475894902348/1-s2.0-0169475894902348-main.pdf?_tid=62678b3a-3e51-11e4-9b7d-00000aacb361&amp;acdnat=1410948179_b62921a6960eda51d5a4bca1cf5dd2d0|website=Elsevier|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; PCD is now based within [[Imperial College London]]'s Department of Infectious Disease Epidemiology, in [[St Mary's Hospital, London]] with long-term technical assistance operations in Ethiopia, Ghana, Kenya, Mali and Nigeria which are funded by international development organisations including the [[World Bank]] and the [[Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bundy|first1=Donald|title=Rethinking School Health: A Key Component of Education for All|publisher=World Bank|page=84|edition=1st}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organisational Focus==
PCD supports low-income countries to meet their school health needs using the findings of evidence-based research. PCD is a knowledge-based institution which creates and shares information. Core health interventions that PCD supports are [[school feeding in low-income countries|school feeding &amp; nutrition]], deworming, [[WASH|water and sanitation]], disability screening and health education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New NTD Data to Inform Large Scale Deworming in Ethiopia|url=http://www.comminit.com/democracy-governance/content/new-ntd-data-inform-large-scale-deworming-ethiopia|website=The Communication Initiative|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It conducts operational research showing how interventions can be implemented and evaluated at the country level, for example enabling mass treatment of children for common infections such as [[hookworm]] and [[bilharzia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jamison, D. T., J. G. Breman, A. R. Measham, G. Alleyne, M. Claeson, D. B. Evans, P. Jha, A. Mills, and P.

In recent years, a major focus of this work has been assisting educators and health professionals to work together to help schools respond to the threat that [[HIV]]/[[AIDS]] poses to education, as well as supporting governments to better target orphans and vulnerable children in their child health programming.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Measuring the education sector response to HIV and AIDS|url=http://unesdoc.unesco.org/images/0022/002230/223028e.pdf|website=UNESCO|publisher=UNESCO, Paris|accessdate=17 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Skovdal|first1=M|title=Acceptability of conditions in a community-led cash transfer programme for orphaned and vulnerable children in Zimbabwe|journal=Health Policy and Planning|volume=1-9|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A major function of PCD is [[capacity building]], by means of courses and workshops for governmental and non-governmental staff in developing countries. These include annual training courses in school-based health, nutrition in sub-Saharan Africa and Asia in partnership with local academic organisations such as [[Mahidol University]], the [[University of Ghana]] and the [[Kenya Medical Research Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Report of the 2nd Training Course on School Health and Nutrition Programmes in Asia|url=http://www.tm.mahidol.ac.th/training/school-health-nutrition-2013/report-February-2013-Course-Vientiane.pdf|website=Mahidol University, Faculty of Tropical Medicine|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=UNAIDS Inter-Agency Task Team (IATT) on Education Member Activities|url=http://www.unesco.org/bpi/pdf/iatt_member_pcd_041209_en.pdf|website=UNESCO|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

PCD are a core member of [[FRESH, UNESCO|FRESH]] (Focusing Resources on Effective School Health), an inter-agency initiative that the group jointly developed with [[WHO]], [[UNICEF]], [[UNESCO]] and the [[World Bank]]. This initiative is a key guiding strategy for PCD's development work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The FRESH M&amp;E Framework A Generic Framework for Monitoring and Evaluation of School Health Interventions|url=http://siteresources.worldbank.org/EDUCATION/Resources/278200-1290520949227/7575842-1299102554334/FRESH_MandEFramework.pdf|website=World Bank|publisher=World Bank, Washington D.C.|accessdate=18 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Perceptual mapping''' is a [[diagram]]matic technique used by asset [[marketing|marketers]] that attempts to visually display the perceptions of customers or potential customers. Typically the [[positioning (marketing)|position]] of a company's [[product (business)|product]], [[product line]], or [[brand]] is displayed relative to their competition.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Mccarthy, E. J., Mcguiggan, I. R., Perreault, D. W., &amp; Quester, G. P. (2007). ''Marketing: Creating and delivering value.'' Australia, Sydney: McGraw-Hill&lt;/ref&gt; '''Perceptual maps''', also known as '''market maps''', usually have two dimensions but can be multi-dimensional; they can be used to identify gaps in the market and potential partners or merger targets as well as to clarify perceptual problems with a company's product.

== Uses ==
Perceptual mapping enables companies to better understand their customers: the who, why, where, how and what of their behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Drucker|first1=Peter F|title=The Practice of Management|date=2007|publisher=Routledge|location=London|isbn=0750685042|page=x Foreword|edition=2nd}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Brassington|first1=Frances|last2=Pettitt|first2=Stephen|title=Essentials of Marketing|date=2013|publisher=Pearson Education|location=Harlow|isbn=9780273728139|page=243|edition=3|language=English|chapter=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jobber|first1=David|last2=Ellis-Chadwick|first2=Fiona|title=Principles and Practice of Marketing|date=2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Maidenhead|isbn=9780077140007|page=290|edition=7|language=English|format=Paperback|chapter=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Feintzeig|first1=Rachel|title=Business News: Holiday Stress for Businesses|publisher=Wall Street Journal (Europe edition)|date=24 December 2015|page=B2|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Jenkins|first1=Holman W Jr|title=The Broadband Future And Its Enemies|publisher=Wall Street Journal (Europe edition)|date=19 November 2015|location=New York|page=A.10|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;
If a business is perceived in a manner they find unsatisfactory, further research then identifies what can be done to change that. Perceptual mapping also allows businesses to see what consumers think of other brands, particularly their competitors. Regular uses of the maps can help track  preferences, and see changes as they happen. Perceptual mapping can help define market segments, showing clusters of businesses differentiated by key aspects (such as higher class or number of restaurants). Within the clusters found in perceptual maps of entire industries, a business can classify potential partners or possible businesses to merge with, since the clustering of brands signifies the similarity in businesses, meaning they have corresponding attributes. It can also help identify gaps in a market where a new product or service could be introduced.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Perceptual maps can also be used to help keep track of how a new product, such as a recently introduced smartphone, is being viewed in a specific market. It is important to see that the way a business is marketing its product is not only successful, but successful in a manner that aligns with the business’s overarching goal for positioning.

Some companies seem to have fallen out of favor with the public, such as Quicken Loans&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rudegeair|first1=Peter|title=At Quicken Loans, a Will to Do Battle|publisher=Wall Street Journal (Europe edition)|date=16 June 2015|page=25|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; and VW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anonymous|title=A mucky business; The Volkswagen scandal|issue=416.8957|publisher=The Economist|date=26 September 2015|pages=23–25|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perceptual mapping can help elicit the extent of the damage.

== Limitations ==
There are many limitations to perceptual mapping. The largest is the number of variables used. Traditionally, the map uses two variables and does not account for others. This assumption can hinder the reliability of results, as in some cases, it is not safe to assume that there are only two major factors influencing the decision of purchase for a consumer. For example, a graph may use quality of food and pricing, but not take into account other relevant variables such as the number of visits and locations. Also, there is often a blurred line between what a business can offer and what a consumer thinks the business can offer. This could be due to miscommunication, lack of knowledge, impact from social media, and so on. These untruths can influence the result, creating a slight bias in the statistics. Another limitation is data gathering. The data needed to form a perceptual map is usually obtained through surveys, and can be difficult to obtain. The range of behaviours that the map covers is also a constraint, as the limitation to two variables means that its application works mainly with purchase decisions made with little thought and effort, such as purchasing a beverage at a store or going to a fast food restaurant.

== Examples ==
Perceptual maps can have any number of dimensions but the most common is two dimensions. The first perceptual map below shows consumer perceptions of various [[automobile]]s on the two dimensions of sportiness/conservative and classy/affordable. This sample of consumers felt [[Porsche]] was the sportiest and classiest of the cars in the study (top right corner). They felt [[Plymouth (automobile)|Plymouth]] was most practical and conservative (bottom left corner).

[[Image:PerceptualMap1.png|center|frame|Perceptual map of competing products]]

Cars that are positioned close to each other are seen as similar on the relevant dimensions by the consumer. For example, consumers see Buick, Chrysler, and Oldsmobile as similar. They are close competitors and form a competitive grouping. A company considering the introduction of a new model will look for an area on the map free from competitors. Some perceptual maps use different-sized circles to indicate the sales volume or market share of the various competing products.

Displaying consumers’ perceptions of related products is only half the story. Many perceptual maps also display consumers’ ideal points. These points reflect ideal combinations of the two dimensions as seen by a consumer. The next diagram shows a study of consumers’ ideal points in the alcohol/spirits product space. Each dot represents one respondent's ideal combination of the two dimensions. Areas where there is a cluster of ideal points (such as A) indicate a [[market segment]]. Areas without ideal points are sometimes referred to as demand voids.

[[Image:PerceptualMap2.png|center|frame|Perceptual map of ideal points and clusters]]

A company considering introducing a new product will look for areas with a high density of ideal points. They will also look for areas without competitive rivals. This is best done by placing both the ideal points and the competing products on the same map.

Some maps plot ideal vectors instead of ideal points. The map below displays various aspirin products as seen on the dimensions of effectiveness and gentleness. It also shows two ideal vectors. The slope of the ideal vector indicates the ratio of the two dimensions preferred by those consumers within that segment. This study indicates that there is one segment that is more concerned with effectiveness than harshness, and another segment that is more interested in gentleness than strength.

== Other types of mapping ==
=== Spidergrams ===
Spidergrams are an alternative to perceptual mapping that similarly are visual marketing tools; however, spidergrams also request customers to rate attributes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jobber|first1=David|last2=Ellis-Chadwick|first2=Fiona|title=Principles and Practice of Marketing|date=2013|publisher=McGraw-Hill|location=Maidenhead|isbn=9780077140007|page=291|edition=7|language=English|format=Paperback|chapter=8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Multidimensional perceptual maps ===
[[File:Multi-Dimensional Perceptual Map.gif|thumb|Example of a multi-dimensional perceptual map]]
Traditional perceptual maps are built with two visual dimensions (X and Y axis). Multidimensional perceptual maps are built with more dimensions visualised as profile charts in small map regions, and then items are mapped to the regions by their similarity to the vectors that represent the region. A common technique to construct this kind of multidimensional perceptual maps is the [[self-organizing map]]. This helps pinpoint more variables, allowing for more in-depth research into what influences the consumer. This means that the perceptual map can be applied beyond low-involvement purchases, and also helps with identification of segments in a market.

=== Intuitive maps ===
Perceptual maps need not come from a detailed study. There are also intuitive maps (also called judgmental maps or consensus maps) that are created by marketers based on their understanding of their industry. These are limited by not being based on consumer data.

When detailed marketing research studies are done methodological problems can arise, but at least the information is coming directly from the consumer. An assortment of statistical procedures can be used to convert the raw data collected in a survey into a perceptual map. [[Preference regression (in marketing)|Preference regression]] will produce ideal vectors. [[Multi dimensional scaling (in marketing)|Multi dimensional scaling]] will produce either ideal points or competitor positions. [[Factor analysis]], [[discriminant analysis (in marketing)|discriminant analysis]], [[cluster analysis (in marketing)|cluster analysis]] and [[logit analysis (in marketing)|logit analysis]] can also be used. Some techniques are constructed from perceived differences between products, others from perceived similarities, and still others from [[Cross elasticity of demand|cross price elasticity of demand]] data from electronic scanners.

==Modern techniques==

Marketers can reveal shoppers' collective perceptual map with increasing precision and detail by aggregating and analysing their data; this is done, for example, in the smartphone and laptop industries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Lee|first1=Anthony JT|last2=Sun|first2=Chih-Yuan|last3=Yang|first3=Fu-Chen|last4=Chen|first4=Chao-Hung|last5=Wang|first5=Chun-Sheng|title=Mining perceptual maps from consumer reviews|journal=Decision Support Systems|date=2016|volume=82|issue=February|pages=12–25|doi=10.1016/j.dss.2015.11.002|publisher=Elsevier B.V.|language=English|issn=0167-9236}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Zaribaf|first1=Mehdi|last2=Shameli|first2=Nora|title=Notebook Positioning by Perceptual Map and Laddering Method|journal=New Marketing Research Journal |date=Fall 2012 |volume=2 |issue=3|pages=121–134|publisher=University of Isfahan, Iran|language=Persian|issn=2228-7744}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, they can be used in non-commercial applications, such as identifying factors involved in dangerous driving.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Vanlaar |first1=Ward |last2=Simpson |first2=Herb |last3=Robertson |first3=Robyn|title=A perceptual map for understanding concern about unsafe driving behaviours |journal=Accident Analysis and Prevention |date=2008 |volume=40 |issue=5 |pages=1667–1673|doi=10.1016/j.aap.2008.05.009|publisher=Elsevier B.V. |language=English |issn=0001-4575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Physical culture''' is a [[health]] and [[strength training]] movement that originated during the 19th century in Germany, England, and the United States.

==Origins==
The physical culture movement in the [[United States]] of the 19th century owed its origins to several cultural trends.&lt;ref&gt;Shelly McKenzie, ''Getting Physical: The Rise of Fitness Culture in America'' (University Press of Kansas; 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States, German immigrants after 1848 introduced a physical culture system based on gymnastics that became popular especially in colleges. Many local [[Turners|Turner]] clubs introduced physical education (PE) in the form of 'German gymnastics' into American colleges and public schools. The perception of Turner as 'non-American' prevented the 'German system' from becoming the dominating form. They were especially important mainly in the cities with a large [[German-American]] population, but their influence slowly spread.&lt;ref&gt;Gertrud Pfister, "The Role of German Turners in American Physical Education," ''International Journal of the History of Sport'' (2009) 26#13 pp 1893-1925.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the late 19th century reformers worried that sedentary white collar workers were suffering from various "[[diseases of affluence]]" that were partially attributed to their increasingly sedentary lifestyles. In consequence, numerous exercise systems were developed, typically drawing from a range of traditional folk games, dances and sports, military training and [[medical]] [[calisthenics]].

Physical culture programs were promoted through the education system, particularly at [[military academies]], as well as via public and private [[gymnasiums]].

Industry began the production of various items of exercise-oriented [[sports equipment]]. During the early and mid-19th century, these printed works and items of apparatus generally addressed exercise as a form of remedial [[physical therapy]].

Certain items of equipment and types of exercise were common to several different physical culture systems, including exercises with [[Indian club]]s, [[medicine ball]]s, wooden or iron [[wand]]s and [[dumbbell]]s.

[[Combat sports]] such as [[fencing]], [[boxing]], [[savate]] and [[wrestling]] were also widely practiced in physical culture schools, and were touted as forms of physical culture in their own right.

The [[Muscular Christianity]] movement of the late 19th century advocated a fusion of energetic Christian activism and rigorous physical culture training.

=="The Battle of the Systems"==
As physical culture became increasingly popular and profitable, there arose intense national and then international competition amongst the founders and/or promoters of various systems.  This rivalry became informally known as "the [[Battle of the Systems]]".  Both public gyms and educational institutions tended to take an [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] approach, whereas private physical culture [[Club (organization)|clubs]] and [[organizations]] often promoted particular exercise systems according to [[nationalistic]] loyalties.

The [[Germany|German]] [[Turnverein]] promoted a system of what became known as "heavy [[gymnastics]]", meaning strenuous exercises performed with the use of elaborate equipment such as [[pommel horse]]s, [[parallel bars]] and [[climbing]] structures. The Turnverein [[philosophy]] combined physical training with [[intellectual]] pursuits and with a strong emphasis upon German culture. Numerous events in modern competitive gymnastics originated in, or were popularized by the Turnverein system.

The [[Czech Republic|Czech]] [[Sokol]] physical culture movement was largely inspired by the Turnverein.

By contrast with the German and Czech systems, the "Swedish System" founded by [[Per Henrik Ling]] promoted "light gymnastics", employing little, if any apparatus and focusing on [[calisthenics]], [[breathing]] and [[stretching]] exercises as well as [[massage]].

At the turn of the 20th century, bodybuilder and showman [[Eugen Sandow]]'s system, based upon [[weight training|weight lifting]], enjoyed considerable international popularity, while [[Edmond Desbonnet]] and [[George Hebert]] popularized their own systems within France and French-speaking countries.  [[Bernarr Macfadden]]'s system became especially popular within the United States, via the promotion carried out through his publishing empire.

==Physical Culture ("Physie") in Australia==

A physical culture practice for women, informally known as "physie" (pronounced "fizzy") developed in Australia in the 19th century and continues to this day. It combines elements of march, rhythmic gymnastics and dance, with a focus on good posture and is aimed at young girls and women, from pre-school age to seniors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2015-06-23/exploring-sydneys-obsession-with-the-physical-culture-movement/6566726}}&lt;/ref&gt; The original physie school&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smh.com.au/national/physie-the-underground-fusion-of-dance-and-sport-20150626-ghy9m5.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; was the medical gymnasium Bjelke-Petersen Bros, founded in [[Hobart]] in 1892 by Hans Christian [[Bjelke-Petersen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://physicalculture.com.au/history/}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It has been in continuous operation since that time (becoming the Bjelke-Petersen School of Physical Culture Ltd. in 2011). Other leading historical schools include the Edith Parsons School of Physical Culture, founded in Sydney in 1961; and the Burns Association of Physical Culture, founded in Sydney in 1968, both still in operation. Competitions are held between local clubs with an annual championship.

==Contemporary interest in 19th-century physical culture==

Considerable academic research into 19th-century physical culture has been undertaken since the 1980s, and numerous articles, theses and books have been produced addressing the topic from various perspectives.&lt;ref&gt;McKenzie, ''Getting Physical: The Rise of Fitness Culture in America''ch 1&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of contemporary strength and health training programs are based directly upon, or draw inspiration from various physical culture systems.

The historic [[Hegeler Carus Mansion]] in [[LaSalle, Illinois]] features a basement gymnasium that is believed to be a uniquely preserved example of a late-19th-century [[turnverein]] physical culture training facility. 

Modern collections of antique physical culture apparatus include those of the Joe and Betty Weider Museum of Physical Culture, part of the [[H.J. Lutcher Stark Center for Physical Culture and Sports]] at the [[University of Texas at Austin]] and the Gymuseum collection at the Forteza Fitness and Martial Arts studio in Ravenswood, Chicago.

'''''Proof of Heaven: A Neurosurgeon's Journey into the Afterlife''''' is a 2012 auto-biographical book written by the American [[neurosurgeon]] [[Eben Alexander (author)|Eben Alexander III]]. It relates and discusses his memories of experiences during a [[coma]].
__NOTOC__
==Summary==
In the fall of 2008, Alexander, a doctor at Lynchburg General Hospital in Virginia, contracted a very rare [[bacterial meningitis]] and spent seven days in a coma. During this state, Alexander experienced something that gave him reason to believe in consciousness after death. In this book Alexander relates the details of his experience from the point of view of a neurosurgeon and discusses how this has affected his views on life, philosophy and medicine.

'''Psych-Ed''' is an annual national [[psychology]] quiz held for school students in India. 

==Background==
Psych-Ed is India's first psychology quiz, inaugurated in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.indiatoday.in/lifestyle/buzz-top/story/fortis-psychology-quiz-mental-health-children-lifest-332894-2016-08-02|title=India's first-ever psych quiz for students to get kids talking about mental health|date=August 2, 2016|work=India Today}}&lt;/ref&gt; The quiz is held annually in August and September. 

The main objective of the quiz is to address the [[mental health]] concerns among the youth in India. The quiz was conceptualized and executed by Dr. Samir Parikh, Director of Department Mental Health &amp; Behavioural Sciences at [[Fortis Healthcare]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.businessworld.in/article/Eupheus-Learning-And-Fortis-Healthcare-Join-Hands-To-Bring-Psychology-And-Mental-Health-To-Light/12-07-2018-154606/|title=Eupheus Learning And Fortis Healthcare Join Hands To Bring Psychology And Mental Health To Light|date=July 12, 2018|work=Businessworld}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.newznew.com/psych-ed-iii-2018-indias-only-national-quiz-competition-on-psychology-for-school-students-opens-registration/|title=PSYCH-ED III 2018 – India’s Only National Quiz Competition On Psychology For School Students–Opens Registration|date=July 10, 2018|work=Newznew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Format== 
The format of the quiz is designed to teach psychological concepts. The different rounds include rollover, [[riddle]], [[puzzle]], wipe out round, and minus point rounds. The quiz tests the knowledge of psychology and allied sciences, making students think analytically and methodically.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.healthcareexecutive.in/fortis-psyched-ii-2017-held-fortis-memorial-research-institute-gurugram|title=fortis-psyched-ii-2017-held-fortis-memorial-research-institute-gurugram|date=August 22, 2017|work=healthcareexecutive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Psych-Ed is conducted in 3 rounds. A school can register one team of 3 students to participate in the quiz. The first round is an online multiple choice question round. 72 zonal finalists are selected for round 2 on the basis of the scores of round 1. 12 teams per zone are selected to represent the 6 zones. The zonal rounds are conducted at Delhi-NCR, [[Mumbai]], [[Kolkata]], [[Bengaluru]], [[Mohali]] and [[Jaipur]]. For the grand finale, 6 winners from the zonal rounds compete at Delhi-NCR. The final round includes diverse activities, and the team with the highest score is declared the winner of Psych-Ed for that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.dailypioneer.com/avenues/psych-ed-quiz-competition.html|title=PSYCH-ED QUIZ COMPETITION

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1781">The '''Royal Danish Academy of Suregry''' ([[Danish language|Danish]]: Det Kongelige Kirurgiske Akademi), or '''Academia Chirurgorum Regia''', was an educational institution which existed from 1785 until 1842 in [[Copenhagen]], [[Denmark]]. Its former building at [[Bredgade]] now houses [[Medical Museion (Copenhagen)|Medical Museion]], [[University of Copenhagen]]'s museum of medicine.

==History==
The Academy of Surgery was founded on [[1785 in Denmark|22 June 1785]] as a replacement for the [[Theatrum Anatomico-chirurgicum]] from 1736.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kobenhavnshistorie.dk/bog/khsd/1700/1785.html|title=1785|language=Danish|publisher=Selskabet for Københavns Historie|accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Queen Dowager [[Juliana Maria of Brunswick-Wolfenbüttel|Juliane Marie]] donated a lot in Bredgade, near [[Frederiks Hospital]], and a building for the new institution was completed in 1787 to a design by Peter Meyn. The first president of the Academy was Alexander Kølpin (1731&amp;ndash;1801).

The Academy of Surgery merged with the Faculty of Medicine at the [[University of Copenhagen]] on 1 January 1842. The building remained in use for dissections and lectures on surgery. It now houses [[Medical Museion (Copenhagen)|Medical Museion]], the University's museum of medicine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Krop,_psyke_og_sundhed/Sundhedsvidenskab/Medicinens_historie/Kirurgisk_Akademi|title=Kirurgisk Akademi|language=Danish|publisher=Gyldendal|accessdate=2012-04-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Ruth Morris Bakwin''' (1898 – July 31, 1985) was a noted [[pediatrician]] and child psychologist and the first woman intern at the Fifth Avenue Hospital in New York City (now the [[New York Medical College]]). Bakwin and her husband, also a pediatrician, were long associated with [[New York University School of Medicine]].

Bakwin died on vacation in Alaska in 1985. She and her husband, who died in 1973, owned an 1890 [[Vincent van Gogh]] painting that they passed to their son before it was sold for more than $40 million in 2006.

==Biography==
Bakwin was born in Chicago in 1898. Her parents were Edmund Morris and Helen Swift Morris, and their fathers had been meat-packing plant owners [[Edward Morris (businessman)|Edward Morris]] and [[Gustavus Franklin Swift|Gustavus Swift]], respectively.&lt;ref name="Tribune"&gt;{{cite web|title=Dr. Ruth M. Bakwin, New York pediatrician|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1985-08-03/sports/8502200648_1_pediatrics-edward-pioneer|website=[[Chicago Tribune]]|accessdate=March 26, 2017|language=en|date=August 3, 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bakwin was educated at [[Wellesley College]] and [[Weill Cornell Medicine|Cornell University Medical School]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.nytimes.com/1985/08/02/nyregion/dr-ruth-bakwin-dies-professor-of-pediatrics.html |title= Dr. Ruth Bakwin dies; professor of pediatrics |date= August 2, 1985 |work= [[The New York Times]] |accessdate= December 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; While at Cornell, Bakwin started a fund to assist students at the school with financial need.&lt;ref name="Finding"&gt;{{cite web|title=Finding aid to the Ruth Morris Bakwin, MD (1898-1985) Papers|url=http://library.weill.cornell.edu/sites/default/files/bakwin_0.pdf|publisher=[[Weill Cornell Medicine]]|accessdate=March 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1925 Ruth and [[Harry Bakwin]] married in Paris. Harry was also a pediatrician, and he had been one of the first physicians to diagnose a patient with [[autism]]. While the Bakwins were in postgraduate training in Europe, where most people drank beer at the end of the day, they instead took up art appreciation. On a return visit to Europe in the late 1920s, they purchased [[Vincent van Gogh]]'s 1890 version of ''[[L'Arlésienne (painting)|L'Arlésienne]]''. The Bakwins befriended several well-known artists, including [[Diego Rivera]] and [[Chaim Soutine]].&lt;ref name="Sheets"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sheets|first1=Hilarie M.|title=Parting with the family van Gogh|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/04/22/arts/design/parting-with-the-family-van-gogh.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=March 26, 2017|date=April 22, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ruth Bakwin studied with [[Anna Freud]] in Vienna.&lt;ref name=Tribune/&gt;

Bakwin was a member of the Department of Pediatrics at the New York University Medical School from 1930 until her death. She was also Director of Pediatric Services at the New York Infirmary from 1936 to 1954 and was elected a member of its Board in 1961, and then became a trustee after the Infirmary merged with Beekman Hospital (now the [[New York Downtown Hospital]]) in 1979. With her husband, she co-authored several textbooks including the highly regarded ''Clinical Management of Behavior Disorders in Children'' (1968).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Ogilvie, Marilyn |title= The Biographical Dictionary of Women in Science: Pioneering Lives from Ancient Times to the Mid-20th Century, Volume 1|year=2000|publisher=Routledge|location=New York, NY|isbn=0-415-92038-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1950 she received the [[Hobart and William Smith Colleges|Elizabeth Blackwell Award]] for her distinguished career in pediatrics from the New York Infirmary. In 1983 she won the Alumnae Achievement Award at Wellesley College.&lt;ref name="Wellesley"&gt;{{cite web|title=Ruth Morris Bakwin '19 |url=https://www.wellesley.edu/alumnae/awards/achievementawards/allrecipients/ruth_morris_bakwin_19#ep5l0DVeItyswOCZ.97| website=[[Wellesley College]]|accessdate=March 26, 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While on vacation in 1985 in [[Kodiak, Alaska]], Bakwin died of a heart attack. She was predeceased by her husband in 1973. In 2006 Bakwin's son Edward sold ''L'Arlésienne'' at [[Christie's]] in New York for $40.3 million.&lt;ref name="Vogel"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Vogel|first1=Carol|title=A famous face, and now an auction star|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/05/03/arts/design/03auction.html|website=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=March 26, 2017|date=May 3, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the U.S.,  both the term "sheltered workshop" and its replacement term, "work center," are used by the Wage and Hour Division of the [[U.S. Department of Labor]] to refer to entities that are authorized to employ workers with disabilities at sub-minimum wages.&lt;ref name=DOLFOHGLOSSARY&gt;{{cite web| title = U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, Field Operations Handbook, Chapter 64, 'Employment of Workers with Disabilities at Special Minimum Wages under Section 14(c),' Section 64k, 'Addendum,' Section 64k00, 'Glossary,' 'Sheltered Workshop or Work Center.'| url= http://www.dol.gov/whd/FOH/ch64/64k00.htm|accessdate = 2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The term has generally been used to describe facilities that employ people with disabilities exclusively or primarily.&lt;ref name=DOLFOHCOVERAGE&gt;{{cite web| title = U.S. Department of Labor, Wage and Hour Division, Field Operations Handbook, Chapter 64, 'Employment of Workers with Disabilities at Special Minimum Wages under Section 14(c),' Section 64b, 'Coverage,' Section 64b01, 'Enterprise Coverage,' 'Competitive employment.'| url= http://www.dol.gov/whd/FOH/ch64/64b01.htm|accessdate = 2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

U.S. public policy at the Federal level has shifted away from sheltered workshops in favor of “'administer[ing] services, programs, and activities in the most integrated setting appropriate to the needs of . . . individuals with disabilities. . . . ['T]he most integrated setting' is one that 'enables individuals with disabilities to interact with nondisabled persons to the fullest extent possible . . . .'”&lt;ref name=DOJOlmstead&gt;{{cite web| title = Statement of the U.S. Department of Justice on Enforcement of the Integration Mandate of Title II of the Americans with Disabilities Act and Olmstead v. L.C. | url= http://www.ada.gov/olmstead/q&amp;a_olmstead.htm|accessdate = 2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sheltered workshops in the U.S. have become the subject of criticism for being exploitative, abusive and discriminatory.  In January 2011, the National Disability Rights Network, or NDRN, issued a report titled "Segregated and Exploited:  The Failure of the Disability Service System to Provide Quality Work."&lt;ref name=NDRMREPT&gt;{{cite web| title =National Disability Rights Network, 'Segregated and Exploited:  The Failure of the Disability Service System to Provide Quality Work,' January 2011.| url= http://www.ndrn.org/images/Documents/Resources/Publications/Reports/Segregated-and-Exploited.pdf|accessdate = 2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The report charged that "hundreds of thousands of people with disabilities are being isolated and financially exploited by their employers."&lt;ref name=NDRMREPT /&gt;

In March 2011, a speech by Samuel R. Bagenstos, the Principal Deputy Assistant Attorney General in the Civil Rights Division of the [[U.S. Department of Justice]], cited the NDRN report in explicitly criticizing the entire concept underlying the sheltered workshop.&lt;ref name=bagenstos&gt;{{cite web| title = Bagenstos, Samuel R., '''Olmstead'' Goes to Work,' Remarks as Prepared for Delivery at Case Western Reserve University School of Law, March 15, 2011| url= http://www.ada.gov/olmstead/documents/bagenstos_speech_cwru.pdf|accessdate = 2011-08-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Bagenstos took the position that the principle articulated in the U.S. Supreme Court decision in [[Olmstead v. L.C.]]—which he described as "that persons with disabilities have a right to spend their lives in the most integrated setting appropriate for them as individuals" -- "is just as sensibly applied to the employment setting."   He argued that "a full and equal life in the community—the ultimate goal of ''Olmstead''—cannot be achieved without a meaningful, integrated way to spend the day, including integrated 'work options.'"&lt;ref name=bagenstos /&gt;  And he stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;[W]hen individuals with disabilities spend years— indeed, decades—in congregate programs doing so-called jobs like these, yet do not learn any real vocational skills, we should not lightly conclude that it is the disability that is the problem. Rather, the programs’ failure to teach any significant, job-market-relevant skills leaves their clients stuck. As a recent review of the literature concludes, “[t]he ineffectiveness of sheltered workshops for helping individuals progress to competitive employment is well established.”&lt;ref name=bagenstos /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==United Kingdom==

In the U.K., the term has been replaced with [[social enterprise]].  However, the notion of 'social enterprise' implies that the organisation would trade in the market and take on a degree of business [[risk]], and not be completely dependent on government [[subsidy]], as the traditional model of the sheltered workshop may allow. In this newer model, the enterprise might receive a [[subsidy]] in compensation for the reduced [[productivity]] of its disadvantaged workers, in order to allow it to compete on a "level playing field" with conventional firms.

==Australia==

The Australian Disability Enterprise (ADE) sector in Australia generally has its roots in the early 1950s when families of people with disability established sheltered workshops to provide vocational activity for people with disability. At this time employment opportunities for people with disability were extremely limited.

In 1986, following the introduction of the Commonwealth Disability Services Act (1986) principles and objectives for service delivery was passed into legislation. This resulted in the transition from the Sheltered Workshop system to the new business services model. In 1996, additional reforms were introduced for the purpose of improving service quality, matching service funding to the support needs of people with disability receiving assistance, and to link funding to employment outcomes. This led to a reform agenda in the ADE sector, with the introduction of legislated Quality Assurance standards that required ADEs to obtain independent verification of their compliance to these prior to receiving ongoing funding from the Australian Government. Additionally, a funding model that links payments to individual support needs was introduced.

.&lt;ref name="dss.gov.au"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dss.gov.au/our-responsibilities/disability-and-carers/program-services/for-service-providers/australian-disability-enterprises |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150327022439/https://www.dss.gov.au/our-responsibilities/disability-and-carers/program-services/for-service-providers/australian-disability-enterprises |archivedate=2015-03-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; ADEs are primarily not for profit organisations, with profits reinvested in the employees with a disability or supplementary services for these employees.&lt;ref name="dss.gov.au"/&gt;

In Australia, funding can only be used to provide training and support to 'supported' employees. This type of employment is in contrast to 'open employment' where people with disabilities enter mainstream, competitive employment alongside people without disabilities.

In some ADEs individuals are paid as little as $1.79 an hour, based on the BSWAT (Business Services Wage Assessment Tool), which was found to be discriminatory in 2013 and will be phased out by April 2015 .&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Wage Justice Campaign - People With Disabilities Australia |url=http://www.pwd.org.au/campaigns/real-wages-for-real-work.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.humanrights.gov.au/department-social-services-dss&lt;/ref&gt; The BSWAT tool is not used in all ADEs, indeed, many ADEs argued it was unsuitable when it was first introduced. Wages are based on a percentage of award rates, according to the workplace competencies and productivity of the person with a disability in comparison to a worker without a disability. The work undertaken in ADEs is often of a kind that would generally be undertaken by automated processes and has a very low profit margin for the ADE - the purpose of the work is marketed as to not to make a profit, but to allow the person with a disability the opportunity to engage in an employment environment, providing a sense of contribution and the dignity of work.

Following on from the court challenge on the discriminatory nature of the BSWAT, a large percentage of parents and employees of ADEs (along with the relevant Peak Body, National Disability Services) began a campaign to ensure their jobs were protected. Many raised the point that ADEs are not typical workplaces and provide significantly more support and opportunities than open employment workplaces. These parents, carers and Employees were concerned that if ADEs were forced to pay full livable award wages for employees with a disability, many would be financially unsustainable.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ade.org.au/about-us&lt;/ref&gt;  An episode of the ABC's Background Briefing in September 2014 discounted many of the parents and ADE's claims as deceptive spin, for sustaining the exploitative nature of the entire scheme.  &lt;ref&gt;http://www.abc.net.au/radionational/programs/backgroundbriefing/the-fair-wage-campaign-that-backfired/5765182&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Society for Epidemiologic Research''' (abbreviated '''SER''') is a [[learned society]] dedicated to [[epidemiology]]. It was originally proposed in 1967 by [[Abraham Lilienfeld]], [[Milton Terris]], and [[Brian MacMahon]], and was founded the following year.&lt;ref name=editorial&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harlow|first1=Bernard L.|last2=Szklo|first2=Moyses|title=Editorial: The 50th Anniversary of the Society for Epidemiologic Research|journal=American Journal of Epidemiology|date=1 June 2017|volume=185|issue=11|pages=988–989|doi=10.1093/aje/kwx120}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its co-founders included Lilienfeld, Terris, and MacMahon. Their motivation in founding SER was to provide an annual meeting where junior faculty in epidemiology departments and graduate students could present their ongoing research to senior epidemiologists and receive criticism, comments, and encouragement. 

Since 1968, SER has grown and its current membership is approximately 1800 individuals. The mission of SER today is “to keep epidemiologists at the vanguard of scientific developments”.&lt;ref&gt;Boslaugh S, editor. Encyclopedia of Epidemiology. Thousand Oaks, CA: SAGE Publications, Inc.; 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;         

==Leadership==
In 2016, [[Andrew Olshan]] was elected president of the society; he became president-elect on July 1 of that year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://sph.unc.edu/sph-news/olshan-elected-president-of-society-for-epidemiologic-research/ | title=Olshan elected president of Society for Epidemiologic Research | publisher=UNC Gillings School of Global Public Health | work=News | date=6 July 2016 | accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suzanne S. Bevan serves as executive director.

==Annual Meeting==
An annual meeting is held by the SER in June of each year. Of particular interest is the idea of consequential epidemiology, or the public health, preventive medicine, intervention, and policy implications of epidemiology, which is further discussed in a 2015 publication by Frumkin.&lt;ref&gt;Frumkin H. Work that matters: toward consequential environmental epidemiology. Epidemiology 2015; 26(2): 137-40.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The annual meeting typically brings together 750 to 900 attendees.  Annual meetings have been held since 1968, and consist of presentations of ongoing research, a keynote address on a topic of current interest, and instructional workshops prior to the conference that began in the 1980s. Ongoing research was initially presented by the means of slides, but in 1997 this was changed to posters.  Abstracts presented at SER meetings are annually published in a supplemental issue of the American Journal of Epidemiology.&lt;ref&gt;Oxford University Press. American Journal of Epidemiology. 2017. https://academic.oup.com/aje (accessed May 25 2017).&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publications==
The Society sponsors two [[peer-reviewed journal]]s: the ''[[American Journal of Epidemiology]]'' and ''[[Epidemiologic Reviews]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://epiresearch.org/about-us/ | title=About Us | work=Society for Epidemiologic Research | accessdate=20 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to this, SER also releases digitally the SERplaylist, SERtalks, SERexperts, and SERdigital.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5351">'''Standards of identity for food''' are mandatory requirements that are set by a governing body to determine what a food product must contain to be marketed under a certain name in allowable commerce. Mandatory standards, which differ from voluntary grades and standards applied to agricultural commodities, protect the consumer by ensuring a label accurately reflects what is inside (for example, that mayonnaise is not an imitation spread or that ice cream is not a similar but different frozen dessert).&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition - Order Code 97-905] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212033139/http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf |date=2011-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A US trade organization defines the term as follows:

"A standard of identity sets out what ingredients a product must contain, which ingredients it may contain, and any requirements of manufacturing.
For example, “Whisky” is defined as “a potable alcoholic distillate obtained from a mash of cereal grain saccharified by diastase of malt or by other enzymes and fermented by the action of yeast”. It may contain caramel and flavouring. No other ingredients are allowed. If someone were to produce a whisky containing a dye, they would not be permitted to call the product “whisky”, since dye is not a permitted additive. 
Standards of identity are set out in the Food and Drug Regulations. They may be identified by the symbol “'''[S]'''” following the product name in boldface type. As such, they are official common names for products and no other name can be substituted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.doingbusinesswithlcbo.com/tro/Packaging-Quality/Label-Standards/Common-Name-Standard-of-Identity.shtml] ''Doing Business with LCBO''&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2014 lawsuit in the United States illustrated the necessity of such regulations. When Hampton Creek implied in its advertising that mayonnaise being marketed by Unilever was not "real" mayonnaise, the latter sued Hampton for defamation and cited the definitions promulgated by the [[Food and Drug Administration]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodbusinessnews.net/Opinion/Keith%20Nunes/Why%20standards%20of%20identity%20matter.aspx?cck=1] ''Why Standards of Identity Matter'', Nunes, Keith, in "Food Business News," 16 June 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
Each State within the US reserves the authority to set standards of identity for foods marketed within the state.  In addition, the departments of the Federal government carry authority to set requirements for food products that are offered for interstate commerce.  Such standards are issued by the [[U.S. Department of Agriculture]],&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OPPDE/larc/Policies/Labeling_Policy_Book_082005.pdf] ''Food Standards and Labeling Policy''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpo.gov/fdsys/pkg/CFR-2012-title9-vol2/pdf/CFR-2012-title9-vol2-part319.pdf] ''Definitions and Standards of Identity or Composition'', Part 319 CFR&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.federalregister.gov/articles/2014/08/20/2014-19770/united-states-standard-of-identity-for-honey] ''United States Standard of Identity for Honey''&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Food and Drug Administration]]&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ag.ndsu.edu/foodlaw/processingsector/standardofidentity]''Standard of Identity, Petitions, Food Additives, Food Product Claims, and Organic Food'', describing the requirements of the 1983 [[Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?CFRPart=130] ''TITLE 21--FOOD AND DRUGS - CHAPTER I--FOOD AND DRUG ADMINISTRATION,

==Canada==
The [[Canadian Food Inspection Agency]] issues standards of identity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inspection.gc.ca/food/labelling/food-labelling-for-industry/eng/1383607266489/1383607344939] Canadian Food Inspection Agency, ''Food Labeling for Industry''&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/regulations/C.R.C.,_c._291/page-23.html] Justice Laws websited, ''Standards of Identity for Specified Fruit and Vegetable Products''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Australia and New Zealand==
The Commonwealth nations use many of the same terms employed by the Canadian Food Inspection Agency.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/code/Pages/default.aspx] Food Standards (Australia and New Zealand), ''Food Standards Code''&lt;/ref&gt; [[Food Standards Australia New Zealand]], formerly Australia New Zealand Food Authority (ANZFA), is the governmental body responsible for developing food standards for Australia and New Zealand.

==France==
*[[Appellation d'Origine Contrôlée]] (AOC), "term of controlled origin" is the French certification granted to certain French geographical indications for wines, cheeses, butters, and other agricultural products.

==Italy==
[[Denominazione di Origine Controllata]] is the Italian quality assurance label for food products and especially wines.

Canine '''subvalvular aortic stenosis''' (SAS) is an abnormal, [[congenital heart defect|congenital]] [[heart murmur]] caused by subaortic [[stenosis]] (SAS).  There is a high incidence of this condition among [[Rottweiler]] dogs.

There is very good evidence that it is heritable, passed on from generation to generation genetically. This genetic trait is what is called [[polygenic]], so that the inheritance is complex. An animal might have the genes for SAS, yet have no actual sign of SAS. Also, an animal might have signs of subaortic stenosis, and yet offspring with signs of SAS may not be seen for a couple of generations. Any animal that has subaortic stenosis should not be bred, because they can definitely pass the defect on to future offspring. There is some controversy as to whether the parents of an animal with SAS should be bred again.

[[Heart murmurs]] are graded on a scale of 1 to 6, with one being very mild and six being very serious, with some animals dying before they reach this high stage due to a sudden leap in the grade or through long-term slowing down.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.akc.org/content/health/articles/heart-murmur-in-dogs/|title=Heart Murmur in Dogs|last=Burke|first=Anna|work=American Kennel Club|access-date=2018-02-12|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murmurs can exist due to a large number of heart problems (infection, trauma, anemia, etc.; some are innocent, with no cardiac pathology. Tests such as chest X-rays, [[echocardiography]], and [[electrocardiography]] can be performed to evaluate the severity of the situation

The condition is usually detected during puppy visits to the veterinarian by hearing a heart murmur during physical examination. A heart murmur is the abnormal sound of blood rushing through one of the heart valves. Instead of just the heartbeat, a whistle of blood flow through a narrowed opening is heard. The puppy will most likely appear normal in all other respects. There is a possibility that the murmur may come and go, or it may develop slowly; this can be determined by frequent checks of a puppy's heart during its first few months. The chance for long-term survival of SAS is low.

Puppies and dogs diagnosed with subaortic [[stenosis]] can suffer from heart failure and sudden death. If a dog with SAS develops heart failure, medications can be prescribed to alleviate the clinical signs (sudden/strong [[lethargicism]], continuous heavy panting, rise in temperature etc.)

The OFA has established a Congenital Heart Registry whose guidelines were established by veterinary cardiologists. A dog which auscultates normally at 12 months of age is considered to be free of [[congenital heart disease]]; upon confirmation of this, the OFA will issue a certificate.

==Rottweilers==
Aortic stenosis in the Rottweiler appears to be true subvalvular aortic stenosis (SAS), similar to that in the [[Newfoundland dog]], as opposed to the valvular form (seen more in [[boxer dogs]]) or the supravalvular form sometimes seen in people.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6107">'''Third-party reproduction''' or '''donor-assisted reproduction''' is any [[human reproduction]] in which [[DNA]] or [[gestation]] is provided by a third party or donor other than the one or two [[parent]]s who will [[child rearing|raise the resulting child]]. This goes beyond the traditional [[father]]–[[mother]] model, and the third party's involvement is limited to the reproductive process and does not extend into the raising of the child. Third-party reproduction is used by couples unable to reproduce where they would otherwise be unable to do so, by [[same-sex couple]]s, and by men and women without a partner. Where donor gametes are provided by a donor, the donor will be a biological parent of the resulting child, but in third party reproduction, he or she will not be the caring parent.

One can distinguish several categories, some of which may be combined:
* [[Sperm donation]]. A donor provides [[sperm]] in order to father a child for a third-party female.
* [[Egg donation]]. A donor provides [[ovum|ova]] to a woman or couple in order for the egg to be fertilized and implanted in the recipient woman.
** [[Spindle transfer]]. A third party's [[mitochondrial DNA]] is transferred to the future mother's ovum. This is used to prevent [[mitochondrial disease]]. 
* [[Embryo donation]] 
** with [[embryo]]s which were originally created for a genetic mother's [[assisted reproductive technology|assisted pregnancy]]. Once the genetic mother has completed her own treatment, she may donate unused embryos for use by a third party.
** or where embryos are specifically created for donation using donor eggs and donor sperm.
* [[Embryo adoption]]. Embryos created during a donor's assisted pregnancy are adopted to be implanted in a third party recipient.
* [[Surrogacy]]. An embryo is gestated in a third party's uterus (traditional surrogacy) or a woman is inseminated in order to gestate a child for a third party (straight surrogacy).

Pregnancy is typically initiated by [[artificial insemination]] in the case of sperm donation and by [[embryo transfer]] after [[in vitro fertilisation]] (IVF) in the case of egg donation, embryo donation, and surrogacy. Thus a child can have a genetic and social (non-genetic, non-biological) father, and a genetic, gestational, and social (non-biological) mother, and any combinations thereof. Theoretically a child thus could have 5 parents.

A '''donor treatment''' is where gametes, i.e. sperm, ova or embryos are provided, or 'donated' by a third party for the purpose of third-party reproduction.

==Combinations==
[[Surrogacy]] includes, in its wider sense, all situations where a ''surrogate'' carries a pregnancy for another person. Recently, there has been a tendency to separate the gestational carrier situation from the "true" surrogate restricting the term for a woman who provides a combination of ovum donation and gestational carrier services.

In a 'conventional surrogacy', a surrogate agrees to be inseminated with the sperm of the male partner of the 'commissioning' couple, or with the sperm of one of the male partners in a same-sex relationship,  or with sperm provided by a [[sperm donor]]. The surrogate is inseminated, conceives, and hands over the baby at the completion of the pregnancy. In conventional surrogacy, the egg which is fertilized is therefore that of the surrogate. A famous case involving [[paternity (law)|paternity]] rights and surrogacy is the [[Baby M]] case.

In a 'gestational surrogacy', a surrogate agrees to the implantation in her of an embryo which may be created either by using an egg provided by another woman who may be part of a 'commissioning' couple, or she may be a single woman. Alternatively, an egg provided by a donor may be used to create the embryo. The embryo implanted in the surrogate may be fertilised using sperm from the male partner of the 'commissioning couple', or by using sperm provided by a [[sperm donor]].

[[Embryo donation]] is where extra embryos from a successful IVF of a couple are given to other couples or women for transfer with the goal of producing a successful pregnancy. Embryos for [[embryo donation]] may also be created specifically for [[embryo transfer]] using donor eggs and sperm, or in some cases donor eggs and donor sperm. It may thus be seen as a combination of sperm donation and egg donation, since what is donated is a combination of these. Such embryos may also be donated to a 'commissioning' woman or a 'commissioning' couple and gestated by a surrogate where, for example, the 'commissioning' woman or the woman of the 'commissioning' couple is infertile and is unable to bring a pregnancy to full term on medical grounds, or is unwilling for social, medical or other reasons, to do so.

{{pp-semi-indef|small=yes}}
[[File:Weewee.JPG|thumb|Sample of human urine]]
'''Urine''' is a liquid [[by-product]] of [[metabolism]] in humans and in many animals. Urine flows from the [[kidney]]s through the [[ureter]]s to the [[urinary bladder]]. [[Urination]] results in urine being [[excretion|excreted]] from the body through the [[urethra]].

The cellular metabolism generates many by-products which are rich in [[nitrogen]] and must be [[clearance (medicine)|cleared]] from the [[Circulatory system|bloodstream]], such as [[urea]], [[uric acid]], and [[creatinine]]. These by-products are expelled from the body during urination, which is the primary method for excreting water-soluble chemicals from the body. A [[urinalysis]] can detect [[nitrogenous waste]]s of the [[mammal]]ian body.

Urine has a role in the earth's [[nitrogen cycle]]. In balanced [[ecosystem]]s urine fertilizes the [[soil]] and thus helps [[plant]]s to grow. Therefore, [[Reuse of excreta|urine can be used]] as a [[fertilizer]]. Some animals use it to [[territory (animal)#Scent marking|mark their territories]]. Historically, aged or fermented urine (known as [[lant]]) was also used for [[gunpowder]] production, household cleaning, [[Tanning (leather)|tanning]] of leather and [[dyeing]] of textiles. 

Human urine and [[human feces|feces]] are collectively referred to as [[human waste]] or human excreta, and are managed with a [[sanitation]] system. [[Livestock]] urine and feces also require proper management if the [[concentrated animal feeding operation|livestock population density is high]].

==Physiology==
{{Main|Renal physiology}}
[[File:Urea Structural Formula V2.svg|thumb|Urea structure]]
Most animals have [[excretory system]]s for elimination of soluble toxic wastes. In humans, soluble wastes are excreted primarily by the [[urinary system]] and, to a lesser extent in terms of [[urea]], removed by [[perspiration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Arthur C. Guyton|author2=John Edward Hall|title=Textbook of medical physiology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=sTZHAQAAIAAJ|accessdate=26 September 2011|year=2006|publisher=Elsevier Saunders|edition=11|isbn=978-0-8089-2317-6|chapter=25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The urinary system consists of the [[kidney]]s, [[ureter]]s, [[urinary bladder]], and [[urethra]]. The system produces urine by a process of [[filtration]], [[absorption (chemistry)|reabsorption]], and tubular secretion. The kidneys extract the soluble wastes from the bloodstream, as well as excess water, sugars, and a variety of other compounds. The resulting urine contains high concentrations of urea and other substances, including toxins. Urine flows from the kidneys through the ureter, bladder, and finally the urethra before passing from the body.

=== Duration ===
Research looking at the duration of [[urination]] in a range of [[mammal]] species found that nine larger species urinated for 21 ± 13 seconds irrespective of body size.&lt;ref name="Yang"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Yang|first1=P. J.|last2=Pham|first2=J.|last3=Choo|first3=J.|last4=Hu|first4=D. L.|title=Duration of urination does not change with body size|journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences|date=26 June 2014|volume=111|issue=33|pages=11932–11937|doi=10.1073/pnas.1402289111|pmc=4143032}}&lt;/ref&gt; Smaller species including rodents and bats cannot produce jets and instead urinate with a series of drops.&lt;ref name="Yang" /&gt;

==Characteristics==

===Quantity===
Average urine production in adult humans is around 1.4 L of urine per person per day with a normal range of 0.6 to 2.6 L per person per day, produced in around 6 to 8 urinations per day depending on state of hydration, activity level, environmental factors, weight, and the individual's health.&lt;ref name="RoseParker2015" /&gt; Producing too much or too little urine needs medical attention. [[Polyuria]] is a condition of excessive production of urine (&gt; 2.5 L/day), [[oliguria]] when &lt; 400 mL are produced, and [[anuria]] one of &lt; 100 mL per day.

===Constituents===
{{Further|Urinalysis}}
About 91-96% of urine consists of water.&lt;ref name="RoseParker2015" /&gt; Urine also contains an assortment of inorganic salts and organic compounds, including proteins, hormones, and a wide range of metabolites, varying by what is introduced into the body.

The total solids in urine are on average 59 g per person per day. Organic matter makes up between 65% and 85% of urine dry solids, with volatile solids comprising 75–85% of total solids. [[Urea]] is the largest constituent of the solids, constituting more than 50% of the total. On an elemental level, human urine contains 6.87 g/L carbon, 8.12 g/L nitrogen, 8.25 g/L oxygen, and 1.51 g/L hydrogen. The exact proportions vary with individuals and with factors such as [[diet (nutrition)|diet]] and health.&lt;ref name="RoseParker2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rose|first1=C.|last2=Parker|first2=A.|last3=Jefferson|first3=B.|last4=Cartmell|first4=E.|title=The Characterization of Feces and Urine: A Review of the Literature to Inform Advanced Treatment Technology|journal=Critical Reviews in Environmental Science and Technology|volume=45|issue=17|year=2015|pages=1827–1879|issn=1064-3389|doi=10.1080/10643389.2014.1000761 | pmc= 4500995 | pmid=26246784 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In healthy persons, urine contains very little protein; an excess is suggestive of illness.

===Color===
[[File:P. 28 a chart showing urine colours and their meaning.jpg|thumb|Medical experts have long connected urine colour with certain medical conditions. A medieval chart showing the medical implications of different urine color]]
Urine varies in appearance, depending principally upon a body's level of [[tissue hydration|hydration]], as well as other factors. Normal urine is a transparent solution ranging from colorless to amber but is usually a pale yellow. In the urine of a healthy individual the color comes primarily from the presence of [[urobilin]]. Urobilin is a final waste product resulting from the breakdown of [[heme]] from [[hemoglobin]] during the destruction of aging blood cells.

Colorless urine indicates over-hydration, generally preferable to dehydration (though it can remove essential salts from the body). Colorless urine in drug tests can suggest an attempt to avoid detection of illicit drugs in the bloodstream through over-hydration.

* Dark yellow urine is often indicative of dehydration.
* Yellowing/light orange may be caused by removal of excess [[B vitamin]]s from the bloodstream.
* Certain medications such as [[rifampin]] and [[phenazopyridine]] can cause orange urine.
* Bloody urine is termed [[hematuria]], a symptom of a wide variety of medical conditions.
* Dark orange to brown urine can be a symptom of [[jaundice]], [[rhabdomyolysis]], or [[Gilbert's syndrome]].
* Black or dark-colored urine is referred to as melanuria and may be caused by a [[melanoma]] or non-melanin [[acute intermittent porphyria]].
* Pinkish urine can result from the consumption of [[beet]]s.
* Greenish urine can result from the consumption of [[asparagus]] or foods or beverages with green dyes.
* Reddish or brown urine may be caused by [[porphyria]] (not to be confused with the harmless, temporary pink or reddish tint caused by [[beeturia]]).
* Blue urine can be caused by the ingestion of [[methylene blue]] (e.g., in medications) or foods or beverages with blue dyes.
* Blue urine stains can be caused by [[blue diaper syndrome]].
* Purple urine may be due to [[purple urine bag syndrome]].

===Odor===
Some time after leaving the body, urine may acquire a strong "fish-like" odor because of contamination with bacteria that break down urea into [[ammonia]]. This odor is not present in fresh urine of healthy individuals; its presence may be a sign of a [[urinary tract infection]].{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}}

The odor of normal human urine can reflect what has been consumed or specific diseases. For example, an individual with diabetes mellitus may present a sweetened urine odor. This can be due to kidney diseases as well, such as kidney stones.

Eating asparagus can cause a strong odor reminiscent of the vegetable caused by the body's breakdown of [[asparagusic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Lison M, Blondheim SH, Melmed RN | title = A polymorphism of the ability to smell urinary metabolites of asparagus | journal = Br Med J | volume = 281 | issue = 6256 | pages = 1676–8 | year = 1980 | pmid = 7448566 | pmc = 1715705 | doi = 10.1136/bmj.281.6256.1676 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Likewise consumption of [[saffron]], [[ethanol|alcohol]], [[coffee]], [[tuna fish]], and [[onion]] can result in telltale scents.{{Citation needed|date=March 2012}} Particularly spicy foods can have a similar effect, as their compounds pass through the kidneys without being fully broken down before exiting the body.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Stefan Gates|author2=Max La Riviere-Hedrick|title=Gastronaut: adventures in food for the romantic, the foolhardy, and the brave|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dlSXXguGw9UC&amp;pg=PA87|accessdate=27 April 2011|date=15 March 2006|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|isbn=978-0-15-603097-7|pages=87–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110713222322/http://www.livestrong.com/article/248141-foods-that-affect-the-odor-of-urine/ Foods that Affect the Odor of Urine].

==Examination for medical purposes==
[[File:Bigot, Trophime - A Doctor Examining Urine.jpg|thumb|270px|right|''A Doctor Examining Urine''. [[Trophime Bigot]].]]Many physicians in ancient history resorted to the inspection and examination of the urine of their patients. [[Hermogenes (philosopher)|Hermogenes]] wrote about the color and other attributes of urine as indicators of certain diseases. Abdul Malik Ibn Habib of [[Andalusia]] d.862 AD, mentions numerous reports of urine examination throughout the [[Umayyad]] empire.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Habib, Abdul Malik d.862CE/283AH "Kitaab Tib Al'Arab" (The Book of Arabian Medicine), Published by Dar Ibn Hazm, Beirut, Lebanon 2007(Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Diabetes mellitus]] got its name because the urine is [[polyuria|plentiful]] and [[sweetness|sweet]]. The name ''[[uroscopy]]'' refers to any visual examination of the urine, including [[microscopy]], although it often refers to the aforementioned prescientific or protoscientific forms of urine examination. [[Clinical urine tests]] today duly note the gross color, turbidity, and odor of urine but also include [[urinalysis]], which chemically analyzes the urine and [[quantification (science)|quantifies]] its constituents. A [[microbiological culture|culture]] of the urine is performed when a [[urinary tract infection]] is suspected, as [[bacteriuria|bacteria in the urine]] are unusual otherwise. A microscopic examination of the urine may be helpful to identify organic or inorganic substrates and help in the diagnosis.

The color and volume of urine can be reliable indicators of hydration level. Clear and copious urine is generally a sign of adequate hydration. Dark urine is a sign of [[dehydration]]. The exception occurs when [[diuretics]] or excessive amounts of [[ethanol|alcohol]]{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} or [[caffeine]]{{citation needed|date=January 2013}} are consumed, in which case urine can be clear and copious and the person still be dehydrated.

===Fertilizer===
{{Main|Reuse of excreta#Urine}}

Urine contains large quantities of nitrogen (mostly as [[urea]]), as well as reasonable quantities of dissolved potassium. The exact composition of nutrients in urine varies with diet, in particular nitrogen content in urine is related to quantity of protein in the diet. A high protein diet results in high urea levels in urine.

Urine is very high in nitrogen (can be over 10% in a high protein diet), low in phosphorus (1%), and moderate in potassium (2-3%). Urine typically contains 70% of the [[nitrogen]] and more than half the [[potassium]] found in urban waste water flows, while making up less than 1% of the overall volume. If urine is to be separated and collected for use as a fertiliser in agriculture, then the easiest method of doing so is with [[sanitation]] systems that utilise waterless [[urinals]], [[Urine-diverting dry toilets|urine-diverting dry toilets (UDDTs)]] or [[urine diversion]] flush toilets.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;von Münch, E., Winker, M.

Undiluted urine can chemically burn the leaves or roots of some plants, particularly if the soil moisture content is low. For this reason, urine fertilizer is usually applied diluted with water.

When diluted with water (at a 1:5 ratio for container-grown [[annual plant|annual]] crops with fresh growing medium each season or a 1:8 ratio for more general use), it can be applied directly to soil as a fertilizer.&lt;ref name="Morgan"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.ecosanres.org/PM_Report.htm|title=An Ecological Approach to Sanitation in Africa: A Compilation of Experiences|last=Morgan|first=Peter|year=2004|edition=CD release|location=Aquamor, Harare, Zimbabwe|chapter=10.

===Cleaning===
Because urea in urine breaks down into ammonia, urine has been used for the cleaning properties of the ammonia therein. In pre-industrial times urine was used – in the form of ''[[lant]]'' or aged urine – as a cleaning fluid.&lt;ref&gt;Sueton, Vespasian 23 [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html#23 English], [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Suetonius/12Caesars/Vespasian*.html#23 Latin].

Urine was also used for [[Urine therapy#Rome|whitening teeth in Ancient Rome]].

===Gunpowder===
{{Main|Potassium nitrate}}
Urine was used before the development of a [[chemical industry]] in the manufacture of [[gunpowder]]. Urine, a nitrogen source, was used to moisten straw or other organic material, which was kept moist and allowed to rot for several months to over a year. The resulting [[Salt (chemistry)|salts]] were washed from the heap with water, which was evaporated to allow collection of crude saltpeter crystals, that were usually refined before being used in making gunpowder.&lt;ref name="LeConte"&gt;&lt;!-- this ref is also used in the potassium nitrate article --&gt;

{{See also|Urophagia}}
The ''[[US Army Field Manual]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.equipped.com/21-76/ch6.pdf Water Procurement], US Army Field Manual&lt;/ref&gt; advises ''against'' drinking urine for survival. These guides explain that drinking urine tends to worsen rather than relieve dehydration due to the salts in it, and that urine should not be consumed in a survival situation, even when there is no other fluid available. In hot weather survival situations where other sources of water are not available, soaking cloth (a shirt for example) in urine and putting it on the head can help cool the body.

During [[World War I]] the [[Germans]] experimented with numerous poisonous gases for use during war. After the first German [[chlorine]] gas attacks, Allied troops were supplied with masks of cotton pads that had been soaked in urine. It was believed that the [[ammonia]] in the pad neutralized the chlorine. These pads were held over the face until the soldiers could escape from the poisonous fumes, although it is now known that chlorine gas reacts with urine to produce [[Chloramine|toxic fumes]] (''see [[chlorine]] and [[use of poison gas in World War I]]'').{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} The [[Vickers machine gun]], used by the British Army during World War I, required water for cooling when fired so soldiers would resort to urine if water was unavailable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.royalarmouries.org/what-we-do/research/nfc/single-object/172 | title=Vickers Mk.I machine gun | publisher=[[Royal Armouries]] | accessdate=September 26, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ancient Rome|Ancient Romans]] used fermented human urine (in the form of [[lant]]) to cleanse grease stains from clothing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ancienthistory.about.com/library/weekly/aa031303a.htm |title=Hygiene in Ancient Rome |accessdate=2010-02-09 |work=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The emperor [[Nero]] instituted a tax ({{lang-la|vectigal urinae}}) on the urine industry, continued by his successor, [[Vespasian]].  The Latin saying ''[[Pecunia non olet]]'' (money doesn't smell) is attributed to Vespasian – said to have been his reply to a complaint from his [[Titus|son]] about the unpleasant nature of the tax. Vespasian's name is still attached to public [[urinal (restroom)|urinal]]s in France (''vespasiennes''), Italy (''vespasiani''), and Romania (''vespasiene'').

[[Alchemy|Alchemists]] spent much time trying to extract gold from urine, which led to discoveries such as [[white phosphorus]] by German alchemist [[Hennig Brand]] when distilling [[fermentation (biochemistry)|fermented]] urine in 1669. In 1773 the French chemist [[Hilaire Rouelle]] discovered the organic compound [[urea]] by boiling urine dry.

== Society and culture ==

=== Language ===
The English word ''urine'' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|juː|r|ᵻ|n}}, {{IPAc-en|ˈ|j|ɜːr|ᵻ|n}}) comes from the [[Latin]] ''urina'' (''-ae'', ''f''.), which is cognate with ancient words in various [[Indo-European languages]] that concern water, liquid, diving, rain, and urination. The [[Onomatopoeia|onomatopoetic]] term "piss" was the usual word for urination before the 14th century. "Urinate" was at first used mostly in medical contexts. "Piss" continues to be used, but is considered vulgar; it is also used in such colloquialisms as "to piss off" and "piss poor", and the slang expression "pissing down" to mean "heavy rain". [[Euphemism]]s and [[baby talk|expressions used between parents and children]] (such as "wee", "pee", and many others) have long existed.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3642">[[File:Wrocław water tower Wisniowa.JPG|thumb|right|150px|View from the east, from avenue Wiśniowa]]
This historic '''Wrocław water tower''' is situated in Borek, the district of [[Krzyki]] that is the southern borough of [[Wrocław]], [[Poland]] (formerly Breslau in Germany).

==Construction==
The [[water tower]] at Sudecka Street (formerly Hohenzollernstraße) in Wrocław was designed by [[Karl Klimm]], a reputed local architect. Famed at the beginning of the 20th century, Klimm also designed the impressive building of the High School of Construction Engineering and Machinery (the today’s Faculty of Architecture of the [[Wrocław University of Technology]]) and the [[Zwierzyniecki Bridge]] (formerly known as the Pass Bridge).

Built 1904-1905 beside Wiśniowa Avenue and Sudecka Street junction, the tower supplied water to the residents of the southern districts of Wrocław for many years. The tower is 63 meters high. It was equipped with an electric lift from the very beginning. From June 1906 the lift allowed people to reach an observation deck situated at a height of 42 meters (the ticket cost 10 pfennig), from which one could admire the vista of Wrocław, its surroundings and [[Mount Ślęża]]. Two years later a red flag used to be hung at the top to inform people about very good viewing of the [[Sudetes|Sudety Mountains]] on a given day.

Two sculptors, Taschner and Bednorz, decorated the lower part of the building with [[bas-relief]]s in [[sandstone]], representing fantastic creatures reminiscent of medieval [[bestiary|bestiaries]]. From a fountain situated on the north-eastern [[façade]] flowed crystal clear water that had its source in the tower’s vault. The fountain once depicted a [[nymph]] mounting [[Triton (mythology)|Triton]].

This giant brick construction was modelled on medieval castles. The tower was placed on solid foundations, which housed flats for company employees operating the water supply system.

==History==
During the [[Battle of Breslau (1945)|Battle of Festung Breslau]] in 1945 the tower served as a command point. The surrounding area was heavily bombed and damaged in raging combat, yet the tower remained almost intact during [[World War II]]. However, the war and the following years saw the tower suffer greatly from neglect. Until the mid eighties the tower served as a reservoir, equalizing water pressure for the southern districts.

In 1995 the tower was purchased from the city by the Stephan Elektronik Investment Company. The building was rejuvenated and started its new life as a stylish [[restaurant]] complex, called ''Wieża Cisnień'' (the [[Polish language|Polish]] name for "water tower").

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6727">'''Your Disease Risk''' is a publicly available [[health risk assessment]] tool on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;Crokcer, MK. SPH Web Site Predicts Cancer Risk.  The Harvard Crimson.  January 26, 20000&lt;/ref&gt;  Launched in early 2000 and continually updated, the site offers risk assessments for twelve different cancers and four other important chronic diseases: heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and osteoporosis.

The site began in 1998 as a pen and paper questionnaire called the Harvard Cancer Risk Index.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite journal  |vauthors=Colditz GA, Atwood KA, Emmons K, etal |title=Harvard report on cancer prevention volume 4: Harvard Cancer Risk Index. Risk Index Working Group, Harvard Center for Cancer Prevention |journal=Cancer Causes Control |volume=11 |issue=6 |pages=477–88 |date=July 2000 |pmid=10880030 |url=http://www.kluweronline.com/art.pdf?issn=0957-5243&amp;volume=11&amp;page=477}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In January 2000, The Harvard Cancer Risk Index developed into an online assessment and was renamed Your Cancer Risk, and offered assessments for four cancers: breast, colon, lung, and prostate.  Six months later, eight additional cancers were added.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Voelker R |title=Quick uptakes: online risk assessment expands |journal=JAMA |volume=284 |issue=4 |pages=430 |date=July 2000|doi=10.1001/jama.284.4.430-b  |pmid=10904490 |url=http://jama.ama-assn.org/cgi/pmidlookup?view=long&amp;pmid=10904490}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, the site was renamed Your Disease Risk to reflect the addition of four further conditions: heart disease, stroke, diabetes, and osteoporosis.  Since many common chronic diseases share risk factors, the renaming promoted the importance of a healthy lifestyle to lowering disease risks.

In 2007, the site moved to the [[Alvin J. Siteman Cancer Center]] at [[Barnes-Jewish Hospital]] and [[Washington University School of Medicine]].

In 2012, researchers released a related iPad [[Mobile app|app]], called Zuum, that offers customized advice for healthier living based on an individual's diet, exercise and other habits.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Moore | first = Elizabeth Armstrong | title = Free iPad app guesses your risk for common diseases | url = http://news.cnet.com/8301-17938_105-57485848-1/free-ipad-app-guesses-your-risk-for-common-diseases | accessdate = 11 January 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2018, the site was re-designed to work across multiple screen sizes - from smartphone to desktop - and a new "Snapshot" tool was added, which provides a quick estimate of 6 diseases from one brief questionnaire. 

== User Experience ==
Your Disease Risk has a simple, straightforward interface.  Questionnaires can be completed in a matter of minutes, and for each disease, the site offers both a visual and verbal risk estimate as well as personalized tips for prevention.  The site can also show users what their risk could be should they adopt various healthy behaviors.  Tailored screening tips and recommendations for making health changes in communities are also part of site results.

== Methodology ==
The calculations and algorithms used to calculate and display risk estimates in Your Disease Risk are the product of an ongoing process of expert consensus.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt; Epidemiologists, clinicians, and other health specialists regularly review the current scientific evidence for each disease, identifying established and probable risk factors for each.  This information is then used to develop or revise calculations that generate a user’s risk of disease compared to average risk in the population for someone of the same age and sex.

A validation study found Your Disease Risk to provide well calibrated estimates&lt;ref name="Kim2004"&gt;{{cite journal|vauthors=Kim DJ, Rockhill B, Colditz GA |title=Validation of the Harvard Cancer Risk Index: a prediction tool for individual cancer risk |journal=J Clin Epidemiol |volume=57 |issue=4 |pages=332–40 |date=April 2004 |pmid=15135833 |doi=10.1016/j.jclinepi.2003.08.013|url=http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/S0895435603003494}}&lt;/ref&gt; of cancer risk in the general population. For individual women, the discriminatory accuracy&lt;ref name="Kim2004" /&gt; for colon cancer was 0.67, for ovarian cancer 0.59, and for pancreatic cancer was 0.71.  For individual men, the discriminatory accuracy&lt;ref name="Kim2004" /&gt; for colon cancer was 0.71 and for pancreatic cancer was 0.72. These values exceed the performance of many other cancer risk prediction tools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Rockhill B, Spiegelman D, Byrne C, Hunter DJ, Colditz GA |title=Validation of the Gail et al. model of breast cancer risk prediction and implications for chemoprevention |journal=J.
