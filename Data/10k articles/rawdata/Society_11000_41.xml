[[File:Strakova akademie z Mánesova mostu (2).jpg|thumb|right|250px|The [[Straka Academy]], seat of the [[Government of the Czech Republic]], was raided by police.]]

The '''2013 Czech political corruption scandal''' started with a raid against organized crime which was conducted  in the [[Czech Republic]] in June 2013 by the [[Police of the Czech Republic|Police]] Unit for Combating Organized Crime ({{lang-cs|Útvar pro odhalování organizovaného zločinu}}, ÚOOZ) and the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office ({{lang|cs|Vrchní státní zastupitelství}}) in [[Olomouc]]. It involved several highly positioned state officers and politicians, as well as controversial entrepreneurs and [[lobbyist]]s. The scandal affected the top levels of [[Czech politics]], including [[List of Prime Ministers of the Czech Republic|Prime Minister]] [[Petr Nečas]] and his [[Petr Nečas's Cabinet|coalition government]]. On 17 June 2013, it resulted in the resignation of the Prime Minister and the cabinet. Nečas also quit as  leader of the [[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|Civic Democratic Party]] (ODS).

== Overview ==
The investigation of the case started in early 2012, according to Robert Šlachta, the head of the Unit for Combating Organized Crime. Ivo Ištvan, the Chief Public Prosecutor in Olomouc, confirmed that a total of 400 policemen were deployed in the raid.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/policie-pri-zatahu-jsme-nasli-150-milionu-a-desitky-kilogramu-zlata-p9w-/krimi.aspx?c=A130614_111235_krimi_jav|title=Při zátahu našla policie až 150 milionů a desítky kilogramů zlata|date=14 June 2013|work=Mladá fronta DNES|publisher=iDNES|language=Czech|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 13 June 2013, some of the closest advisors and collaborators of the [[Czech Prime Minister]], including Jana Nagyová, Managing Director of the Section of the Prime Minister of the [[Czech Republic's Cabinet]], and Lubomír Poul, Director of the Office of the Government, were arrested in association with unspecified misconduct. Ondrej Páleník, former head of the [[Military Intelligence Service (Czech Republic)|Military Intelligence Service]]; Milan Kovanda, current head of the Military Intelligence Service;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.ihned.cz/politika/c1-60063860-policiste-zadrzeli-sefa-vojenske-rozvedky-kovandu-razie-probehla-i-v-jeho-uradu|title=Policisté zadrželi šéfa vojenské rozvědky Kovandu.

The seat of the Government of the Czech Republic and offices of several influential Prague lobbyists were raided by police.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lidovky.cz/zasahovali-jsme-na-vlade-na-pripadu-pracujeme-nekolik-mesicu-pra-/zpravy-domov.aspx?c=A130613_140816_ln_domov_ogo|title=Na vládě jsme zasahovali, zopakoval mluvčí policie.

He also denied speculation about his resignation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lidovky.cz/necas-nemam-informace-o-zadne-trestne-cinnosti-svych-spolupracovniku-1el-/zpravy-domov.aspx?c=A130613_161703_ln_domov_ogo|title=Nerezignuji, Nagyové věřím dál, řekl nalezený Nečas|date=13 June 2013|work=Lidové noviny|publisher=lidovky.cz|language=Czech|accessdate=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.ihned.cz/cesko/c1-60061380-na-uradu-vlady-zasahovala-v-noci-policie|title=Všechno směřuje k zakázkám pražských kmotrů.

On 14 June 2013, the Unit for Combating Organized Crime and the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office in Olomouc announced that Nagyová and members of the Military Intelligence Service had been accused of [[abuse of power]] and corruption. Nagyová, one of the closest collaborators of the Prime Minister, allegedly misused the Intelligence Service to monitor Nečas' wife (among others)&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-22903570|title=Czech PM Petr Necas under pressure as aide charged |date=14 June 2013|publisher=BBC|accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; without the official approval of the [[Ministry of Defence (Czech Republic)|Defence Minister]] in late 2012. Her motives were, according to the police, purely private. Petr Nečas was in divorce proceedings when the scandal erupted.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/zpravy/politika/_zprava/sefka-necasova-kabinetu-si-udajne-objednala-u-vojaku-sledovani-premierovy-zeny--1224309|title=Šéfka Nečasova kabinetu si údajně objednala u vojáků sledování premiérovy ženy|last=Firbacherová|first=Pavla |date=14 June 2013|publisher=[[Czech Radio]]|language=Czech|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/06/15/world/europe/czech-police-charge-7-in-corruption-investigation.html?_r=0|title=Czech Police Charge Officials in Corruption Investigation|last=Bilefsky|first=Dan|date=14 June 2013|publisher=The New York Times|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=idnes/&gt;

Additionally, the investigation targeted an organized group of lobbyists and state officers attempting to influence state institutions for their own enrichment. The Unit for Combating Organized Crime confiscated around [[CZK]] 120{{ndash}}150m ($7.8m&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.economist.com/blogs/easternapproaches/2013/06/czech-politics-0|title=Is this the political end of Petr Nečas? |date=14 June 2013|publisher=The Economist|accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;) in cash and tens of kilograms of gold during the raid. Eight people were charged with various offences.&lt;ref name="idnes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/policie-pri-zatahu-jsme-nasli-150-milionu-a-desitky-kilogramu-zlata-p9w-/krimi.aspx?c=A130614_111235_krimi_jav|title=Při zátahu našla policie až 150 milionů a desítky kilogramů zlata|date=14 June 2013|work=[[Mladá fronta DNES]]|publisher=iDNES|language=Czech|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/zeman-povazuje-obvineni-vznesena-v-kauze-nagyova-za-podlozena-p73-/domaci.aspx?c=A130615_114457_domaci_js|title=Zeman láme hůl nad Nečasem.

Nečas, under pressure from opposition parties and politicians, repeated his refusal to resign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/vyjadreni-premiera-necase-ve-snemovne-policejni-razie-pp6-/domaci.aspx?c=A130614_114147_domaci_jj|title=Nečas odsoudil postup policie, trafiky považuje za politickou dohodu|last=Jiřička|first=Jan |date=14 June 2013|work=Mladá fronta DNES|publisher=iDNES|language=Czech|accessdate=14 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; He issued an apology for the actions of Jana Nagyová and denied that he was aware of it. He also announced her retirement from the office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.ihned.cz/politika/c1-60075050-hluboce-lituji-a-omlouvam-se-reaguje-necas-na-sledovani-lidi-s-nagyovou-se-rozlouci|title=Hluboce lituji a omlouvám se, reaguje Nečas na sledování lidí.

On 15 June, the District Court in [[Ostrava]] decided to take into custody Nagyová, Páleník, Tluchoř, Fuksa, Jan Pohůnek, former employee of the Military Intelligence Service, Marek Šnajdr, former Deputy, and Roman Boček, former employee of the Ministry of Agriculture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/zpravy/politika/_zprava/byvaly-poslanec-za-ods-marek-snajdr-se-dnes-dozvi-jestli-skonci-ve-vazbe--1224860|title=Soud rozhodne, zda pošle Šnajdra do vazby.

On 16 June 2013, Petr Nečas announced that he would resign on Monday, 17 June 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/e4e8da5e-d6d9-11e2-9214-00144feab7de.html|title=Scandal forces Necas to quit as Czech PM|date=17 June 2013|publisher=[[Financial Times]]|accessdate=17 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''"I am fully aware of how the ups and downs of my personal life currently burden the political scene and ODS ... I want to emphasize that I'm aware of my political responsibility and I draw the consequences from that"'', he said.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lidovky.cz/klicove-jednani-koalice-sjizdeji-se-clenove-gremia-ods-ppo-/zpravy-domov.aspx?c=A130616_212823_ln_domov_hm|title=Nečas kauzu Nagyová neustál.

Chci zdůraznit, že jsem si vědom své politické odpovědnosti a vyvozuji z ní tyto důsledky."'')&lt;/ref&gt;

On 16 July 2013, the [[Supreme Court of the Czech Republic]] in [[Brno]] decided in favour of three former members of the [[Chamber of Deputies of the Czech Republic]], Ivan Fuksa, Marek Šnajdr and Petr Tluchoř, on the grounds of their [[parliamentary immunity]] at the time of their involvement in the case. The three named persons were released from prison. Jana Nagyová and the other suspects were released from custody on 19 July 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rozhlas.cz/zpravy/politika/_zprava/1236751|title=Všichni obvinění v kauze Nagyová jsou na svobodě, jako poslední z vazby vyšel Jan Pohůnek|date=19 July 2013|publisher=Czech Radio|language=Czech|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the court, the danger of influencing witnesses has passed, as key witnesses have already been interrogated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/propusteni-nagyove-z-vazby-dfx-/domaci.aspx?c=A130719_102405_domaci_jw|title=Nagyová, Páleník i ostatní jsou na svobodě, ovlivnění svědků už nehrozí|last=Wirnitzer|first=Jan |date=19 July 2013|work=Mladá fronta DNES|publisher=iDNES|language=Czech|accessdate=22 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Czech news websites, Nečas married Nagyová on 21 September 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/svatba-petra-necase-ozenil-jana-nagyova-fck-/domaci.aspx?c=A130921_164445_domaci_skr|title=Bývalý premiér Nečas se podle bulváru oženil s Janou Nagyovou|date=21 September 2013|work=Mladá fronta DNES|publisher=iDNES|language=Czech|accessdate=22 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.ihned.cz/cesko/c1-60840070-necas-s-nagyovou-jsou-podle-bulvaru-manzele-svatbu-ale-utajili|title=Nečas s Nagyovou jsou podle bulváru manželé.

In February 2014, Nečas was charged with bribery.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2014-02-11/czech-ex-pm-charged-with-bribery-in-deal-that-toppled-him.html|title=Czech Ex-PM Charged With Bribery in Deal That Toppled Him |last=Laca|first=Petr|author2=Ponikelska, Lenka|date=12 February 2014|publisher=[[Bloomberg News]]|accessdate=12 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Progress in further years ==

The case of misusing of [[Military Intelligence Service (Czech Republic)|Military Intelligence Service]] had been trialed by District Court of Prague 1 since November 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/necasiva-nagyova-a-zpravodajci-u-soudu-dyj-/krimi.aspx?c=A141119_151317_krimi_cen|title=Soud poprvé veřejně otevře kauzu Nagyová, 521 dní po Nečasově demisi|date=20 November 2014|work=iDNES.cz [online]|publisher=Mafra MF Dnes|language=Czech|accessdate=20 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the trial [[Petr Necas]] himself admitted he requested monitoring of his wife Radka Necasova in 2012 due to security risks connected with his role as PM.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://zpravy.idnes.cz/oduvodneni-verdiktu-v-kauze-nagyova-a-zpravodajcu-fwo-/domaci.aspx?c=A150826_100748_domaci_cen|title=Soudkyně uvěřila Nečasovi, že rodinu nechal sledovat on, ne Nagyová|date=26 August 2015|work=iDNES.cz [online]|publisher=Mafra MF Dnes|language=Czech|accessdate=26 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

On 29 May 2015 the court acquitted all charged persons (including Jana Nagyová and military intelligence officers) of those particular charges while saying the monitoring of later PM’s spouse was not considered as any illegal wrongdoing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://domaci.ihned.cz/c1-64085620-soud-zprostil-janu-necasovou-obzaloby-hrozil-ji-az-3-5lety-trest|title=Soud zprostil Janu Nečasovou viny. Vojenské zpravodajství podle něj nezneužila|date=29 May 2015|work=Hospodářské Noviny [online]|publisher=HN|language=Czech|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The public prosecutor refused such outcome and appealed immediately after court’s statement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://echo24.cz/a/wvJGc/obzaloba-proti-necasove-u-soudu-zkrachovala-istvan-se-divi|title=Obžaloba proti Nečasové u soudu zkrachovala, Ištvan se diví|date=29 May 2015|work=Echo24.cz [online]|publisher=Echo24|language=Czech|accessdate=29 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Appeal court (Regional Court of [[Prague]]) reviewed the trial in April 2016 and annulled it because the District Court overlooked some evidence. Another trial was held but on 17 June 2016, all charged persons were acquitted of their charges once again.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Trest za osvobození Nagyové. Státní zástupce hrozí odvoláním.

== Analysis and conclusions ==
According to the Czech media and political commentators, the case consists of several more or less related parts. A leaked police document based on [[Telephone tapping|wiretapping records]] indicates that spying on the Prime Minister's wife by his managing director was prompted by personal motives and that the relationship between Nagyová and Nečas was more than collegial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tyden.cz/rubriky/domaci/politika/zive-zatah-na-politiky-nagyovou-vyslychali-celou-noc_273366.html|title=Policisté odhalili Nagyovou při prověřování Janouška a Grygárka|date=14 June 2013|publisher=[[Týden]]|language=Czech|accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; "We see a story that meets the quality parameters of a good Mexican [[telenovela]]", commented the newspaper ''[[Mladá fronta DNES]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.parlamentnilisty.cz/arena/monitor/Je-to-komedie-i-tragedie-pisi-deniky-o-premierove-Nagyove-275712|title=Je to komedie i tragédie,píší deníky o premiérově Nagyové|date=15 June 2013|publisher=Parlamentní listy|language=Czech|accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The arrests and charging of several deputies were substantiated by the fact that they were rewarded by lucrative posts in exchange for their resignation and loyalty to the party ([[Civic Democratic Party (Czech Republic)|ODS]]) during an important parliamentary vote. While the police considers it to be a case of corruption, Nečas claims it was a standard political deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/domaci/231268-necas-nekonci-vyzvy-k-odstoupeni-nevyslysim/|title=Nečas nekončí: "Výzvy k odstoupení nevyslyším"|date=14 June 2013|publisher=[[Czech Television]]|language=Czech|accessdate=15 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.businessweek.com/news/2013-06-13/czech-premier-battles-for-survival-as-police-detain-close-aide|title=Czech Illegal Spy Scandal Threatens Necas as Officials Held (5)|last=Laca|first=Peter|date=14 June 2013|publisher=[[Businessweek]]|accessdate=15 June 2013|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nečas found himself among the suspects, as he had promised and provided the bribe to the deputies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hn.ihned.cz/c1-60096530-policie-petr-necas-nabizel-uplatek|title=Policie: Petr Nečas nabízel úplatek|last=Surmanová|first=Kateřina|date=19 June 2013|work=Hospodářské noviny|publisher=iHNED|language=Czech|accessdate=19 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The large police operation also focused on activities of influential Prague entrepreneurs and lobbyists, namely [[Roman Janoušek]] and Ivo Rittig. The investigative authorities raided their offices in association with suspicious activities related to investments made by the Magistrate of the Capital City of Prague and other state-controlled subjects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskatelevize.cz/ct24/exkluzivne-na-ct24/231176-smeruje-razie-k-janouskovi-a-rittigovi-oba-jsou-spojovani-s-pochybnymi-tendry/|title=Směřuje razie k Janouškovi a Rittigovi?

The police investigation was prompted by suspicion that Libor Grygárek, a former Deputy at the Chief Public Prosecutor's Office in Prague, was in connection with an organized group of entrepreneurs abusing state contracts (Janoušek and Rittig were among suspected).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ceskenoviny.cz/zpravy/policiste-nagyovou-odhalili-pri-proverovani-grygarka-a-janouska/951308|title=Policisté Nagyovou odhalili při prověřování Grygárka a Janouška|date=14 June 2013|work=[[ČTK]]|publisher=České noviny|language=Czech|accessdate=16 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Grygárek was neither arrested nor charged with any crime at that time.

'''Arabic tea''' ({{Lang-ar|شاي عربي}}; shay ʿarabiyy &lt;small&gt;Arabic pronunciation:&lt;/small&gt; {{IPA-ar|šāy||Tea pronunciation in Arabic.ogg}}) Is a variety of hot teas popular throughout the [[Arab world]]. It is commonly served to guests and [[Corporate law|business partners]] at [[meeting]]s and [[Party|social events]], and has been drunk by Arab people for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.pilotguides.com/articles/syrian-drinks-repast-in-a-teacup/|title=Syrian Drinks - Syrian Tea - Arab Culture and Hospitality -|work=The Official Globe Trekker Website|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://prezi.com/r-upyncstrij/famous-arabic-tea/|title=Arabian Tea|website=prezi.com|language=en|access-date=2017-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is considered to be a healthy drink largely because boiling water kills of most of the bacteria and viruses that would otherwise cause sickness, and some claim that they offer additional medicinal advantages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://theteaspot.com/tea-traditions.html|title=Tea Traditions, Tea Culture of the World, Tea History {{!}} TEA SPOT|website=theteaspot.com|access-date=2017-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nutrizonia.com/arabic-sage-tea/|title=Arabic Sage Tea - :: Nutrizonia ::|date=2016-02-01|work=:: Nutrizonia ::|access-date=2017-04-07|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Arab society ==
Tea is an important drink in the Arab world and is usually served with breakfast, after lunch, and with dinner. For Arabs, tea denotes [[hospitality]], and is typically served to guests. It is also common for [[Arabs]] to drink tea with dates, which acts as a sweetener. It owes its popularity to its social nature; tea is one of the most important aspects of hospitality and business etiquette in [[Arab culture]]. Importantly, one should not reject tea when offered, because it can be considered rude.

== Varieties ==
There are many different types of Arabic tea:
[[File:Tea and peanuts.jpg|thumb|Arabic tea in [[Libya]] with Peanuts]]
[[image:The menthe.jpg|thumb|right|220px|Maghrebi Mint tea in [[Morocco]]]]
[[Image:شاي أحمر.JPG|thumb|widthpx|Black Tea in [[Tunisia]]]]
*''[[Salvia officinalis | Sage]]'' ({{lang-ar|مريمية}}; Maryamiya) tea is typically served after a meal to aid in digestion and eliminate gas or heartburn. It has a distinct flavor, and, if brewed without black tea, is non-caffeinated. Homegrown, dried sage leaves are considered best for making Sage Arabic Tea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Maramia- Sage Tea {{!}} Rooted In Salt|url=http://www.rootedinsalt.com/2014/07/maramia-sage-tea/|website=Rooted In Salt|date=31 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Chamomile]]'' ({{lang-ar|بابونج}}; bābūnaj) tea is made by brewing dried chamomile flowers and has many health benefits, including reducing stress and anxiety, alleviating pain and discomfort, and also improving sleep and insomnia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Chai Babooneh - Chamomile Tea|url=http://turmericsaffron.blogspot.ch/2012/11/chai-babooneh-chamomile-tea.html|website=turmericsaffron.blogspot.ch}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
*''[[Anise]]'' ({{lang-ar|يانسون}}; Yānsūn) tea has been well known for hundreds of years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Anise Tea (Yansoon) - Taste of Beirut|url=http://www.tasteofbeirut.com/anise-tea-yansoon/|website=Taste of Beirut|date=24 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Thyme]]'' ({{lang-ar|زَعْتَر}}; [[Za'atar|Za'tar]]) tea helps improve memory and cleans out the stomach. Rich in antioxidants, this tea is also useful in preventing aging from within.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=11 Promising Benefits of Za'atar {{!}} Organic Facts|url=https://www.organicfacts.net/health-benefits/herbs-and-spices/zaatar.html|website=www.organicfacts.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Cardamom]]'' ({{lang-ar|هال}}; Hal) tea is very common in the Arab world, and is known for its strong aroma. It is sometimes mixed with coffee, and is said to help digestion and increase saliva flow. It is drunk before meals to prepare digestive enzymes. Although one of the most expensive spices in the world, cardamom is still largely harvested by hand for many Arab customers.
*''[[Maghrebi mint tea]] (at-tāy)'': ({{lang-ar|الشاي}} ''aš-šāy''; [[Maghrebi Arabic]]: التاي ''at-tāy'') also known as Moroccan mint tea, is a [[green tea]] prepared with [[spearmint]] leaves and sugar, traditional to the [[Maghreb]] region (the northwest African countries of [[Morocco]], [[Algeria]], [[Tunisia]], [[Libya]], and [[Mauritania]]). The tea was originally made by English traders and has spread in popularity throughout Africa, France, and other neighboring countries. Known for its flavor and vitality, the fresh mint used to prepare the at-tāy helps to clear the palate after meals.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://moroccanfood.about.com/od/tipsandtechniques/ss/How-To-Make-Moroccan-Mint-Tea.htm|title=How to Make the Perfect Pot of Moroccan Mint Tea|last=|first=|date=|work=|newspaper=About.com Food|access-date=2016-10-21|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.organicauthority.com/eco-chic-table/the-art-of-moroccan-mint-tea-and-how-to-brew-it.html|title=The Art of Moroccan Mint Tea and How to Brew It|last=|first=|date=|website=Organic Authority|publisher=|access-date=2016-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Mentha | Mint]] (Na’nā’)'' ({{lang-ar|شاي بالنعناع}}; ''shay bil na’nā’'') tea is commonly used to get over colds, a sore throat, sinus congestion, and stomach ulcers. Seasonal allergies can also be treated by drinking cups of tea containing rosemarynic acid: an anti-inflammatory agent found in mint.
*''[[Black Tea]]'' ({{lang-ar|شاي أحمر}}; shay ʾaḥmar; Literally: "Red tea") is the most common, usually the brand name Lipton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Syrian Drinks - Syrian Tea - Arab Culture and Hospitality -|url=http://www.pilotguides.com/articles/syrian-drinks-repast-in-a-teacup/|website=The Official Globe Trekker Website}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Roselle (plant)|Hibiscus]]'' ({{lang-ar|كركديه}}; karkaday) tea is drunk hot in the winter and cold in the summer. [[Hibiscus tea]] has a large amount of vitamin C.
*''[[Kuwaiti tea|Cinnamon tea]]'' also [[Kuwaiti tea]] ({{lang-ar|الشاي بالقرفة}}; shay bālqrfh) is created by putting water in a boiler together with cinnamon sticks and sugar. Cinnamon tea contains many health benefits such as bacterial resistance, diabetes treatment, protection against heart disease, and prevention of colon disorders, as well as containing many antioxidant compounds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=9 Benefits of Cinnamon|url=https://www.xn--lgbbz3e9a.net/herbs/cinnamon-health-benefits-and-side-effects|website=Benefits|language=ar-AR|date=10 February 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*''[[Dried lime tea]]''  ({{lang-ar|شاي لومي}}; shay noomi) also known as chai noomi basra, noomi basra tea or loomi tea, is a type of herbal tea made from dried limes that is traditional to [[Iraq]], [[Kuwait]], [[Oman]] and [[United Arab Emirates]].

== Served ==
Tea in the Arab world is usually a strong dark mix, similar to the so-called "breakfast tea" served in other parts of the world. Often brewed with sugar and served in long glasses, it can also be made with mint or cardamom, or with a dash of milk. In Yemen, black tea is brewed in water and milk.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shebayemenifood.com/content/yemeni-tea Yemeni Tea]. shebayemenifood.com. 05.30.2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cartoon violence''' is the representation of [[Violence|violent actions]] involving [[animation|animated]] characters and situations. This may include violence where a character is unharmed after the action has been inflicted.

==Debates==
People have different views about cartoons and the violence within them. Some researchers believe that high level of [[violence in cartoons]] can make children more aggressive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1159766/Cartoon-violence-makes-children-aggressive.html |title=Cartoon violence 'makes children more aggressive' |last=Clark |first=Laura |publisher=Associated Newspapers |location=London |date=2009-03-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their studies also found that young children tend to mimic the negative behavior they see on television. Output aimed at children as young as seven, which include a number of cartoons, had the highest levels of violence.

Some researches on the other hand believe that people need to consider the ways in which children process information, the amount of mental effort they invest, and their own life experience to gain an understanding of how television violence affects children. For instance recent research has indicated that children do not appear to mimic acts of violence in the media, whether television or cartoons.&lt;ref&gt;Christopher J. Ferguson, (2010) "[http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Video%20Games%201%20Year.pdf Video Games and Youth Violence: A Prospective Analysis in Adolescents] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120525061300/http://www.tamiu.edu/~cferguson/Video%20Games%201%20Year.pdf |date=May 25, 2012 }}", ''Journal of Youth and Adolescence''&lt;/ref&gt;
Blumberg, Bierwirth and Schwartz argue that children possess the ability to differentiate real life from animation, as well as the ability to understand right from wrong. They know that violent acts qualify as immoral and infringe on the welfare of others, therefore the violence witnessed in cartoons will register as "make believe" to children and will not be applied into their real lives.&lt;ref name=Blumberg&gt;{{cite journal|author=Blumberg, Bierwirth and Schwartz|title=Does Cartoon Violence Beget Aggressive Behavior in Real Life? An Opposing View|doi=10.1007/s10643-008-0280-1|journal=Early Childhood Educ J|date=26 August 2008|pages=102|publisher=Springer Science+Business Media|subscription =yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Options for Parents and Restriction==
There are a number of ways parents can control their children’s exposure to violence. One of the most effective and common ways of prevention is restricting the amount and types of programs children watch. With older children, parents might want to discuss, and explain television. This can help children to understand television material and overcome the effect [[Television violence|TV violence]] has on their outlook and behaviors.

Three initiatives have been put in place to combat violence in cartoons (&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Cartoon Violence: Is it as Detrimental to Preschoolers as we Think?|journal=Early Childhood Education Journal|date=2002-03-01|first=Kristen|last=Peters|author2=Fran Blumberg|volume=29|issue=3|pages=143–149|id= |url=|type = PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;). The first is The [[Children's Television Act]] which requires [[Broadcasting|broadcaster]]s to air shows which are [[education]]al and provide information for the children. The second initiative is the [[V-chip]] [[legislation]] that gives parents the opportunity to block out violent shows from their television. The third legislation against violent cartoons is the National Cable Television Association’s [[TV Parental Guidelines]], which is a system that rates the [[Television show]]s based on their contents

In [[Action (fiction)|action]]-[[Adventure (genre)|adventure]] oriented cartoons, the most consistent avenue of addressing violence is the use of a form of [[fantasy violence]] in which no one is injured or killed onscreen. In science fiction cartoons, for example, enemy forces are typically said to be [[robot]]s so that they may be destroyed in bulk by the heroes without concern over killing living beings. In cases where vehicles are known to be piloted by living beings, [[tank]]s, [[aircraft]], and other war vehicles that are destroyed in combat always allow time for the [[aviatior|pilot]] to escape or bail out. Realistic [[firearm]]s are often replaced with futuristic [[beam weapon]]s which still seldom hit anyone. Swords and other [[bladed weapon]]s may be prohibited from being used as offensive weapons but may be used defensively or be depicted as magical weapons. Direct violence is frequently limited to [[hand to hand combat]] where directly kicking or punching another character may or may not be allowed. The majority of action adventure cartoons over the past decades have used these methods of depicting dynamic action scenes although their use has been heavily criticized as "sanitized violence". Cartoons based on the [[Voltron]], [[Transformers]], [[G.I. Joe]], and [[Masters of the Universe]] franchises (especially the versions produced during the 1980s) are notable examples using variations on fantasy violence.

Additionally, parents should limit the total screen time for children older than two years of age to no more than one to two hours per day. Children under two years of age should avoid watching television altogether. Televisions should be kept out of children’s bedrooms and parents should watch television with their children and discuss the content.&lt;ref name=Strasburger&gt;{{cite journal|author=Strasburger, V. |author2=Jordan, A. |author3=Donnerstein |last-author-amp=yes |title=Health Effects of Media on Children and Adolescents|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Health practitioners can also play their part by taking the time to ask their young patients how much time per day they spend with entertainment media and if there is a television or computer with Internet access in their bedroom.&lt;ref name=Strasburger/&gt;

==Effects==
{{Main|Media violence research}}
Effects of cartoon violence on youth remain controversial.  Research has generally been divided on this issue with no consensus reached regarding the effects of violence on behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Steven Kirsh, (2006) "[Cartoon violence and aggression in youth]", ''Aggression and Violent Behavior''&lt;/ref&gt; That being said, the impact of exposure to violence may remain regardless of whether children choose to imitate it.&lt;ref name=Blumberg/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3111">'''Casualty estimation''' is the process of estimating the number of injuries or deaths in a battle or natural disaster that has already occurred.  On the other, [[casualty prediction]] is the process of estimating the number of injuries or deaths that might occur in a planned or potential battle or natural disaster.

Measures used to imply casualties include:
* Reported number of kills
* Number of enemy individual weapons captured after engagement
* Number of tanks and aircraft lost
* Remote sensing of mass graves

==Methods==

[[MASINT|Measurement and signature intelligence]] alone cannot give a reasonable estimate of casualties. What [[Electro-optical MASINT#Spectroscopic MASINT|Spectroscopic MASINT]] can do is help find mass graves. [[Geophysical MASINT]] can help localize metal and possibly bodies at that site. [[TECHINT]] is needed if there are weapons or artifacts to analyze.  IMINT has a role to play in  tracking movements. These all have to combine with all-source analysis. Perhaps the losses of tanks and aircraft, if available, might better predict what actually happened in a battle. [[Electro-optical MASINT#Mass graves|MASINT's mass graves capability]] is a means that has been used for remote sensing of clandestine mass graves.

Author Sam Adams' book, ''War of Numbers'' discusses, in great detail, a process of casualty estimation.  Adams was a CIA analyst who eventually resigned over what he felt was political manipulation of casualty figures in the [[Vietnam War]]. He explains how he came up with casualty figures for the NLF and PAVN.  Adams, and other U.S. analysts dealing with a guerilla war in jungle, found there were better metrics than "body count". [[David Hackworth]], for example, used number of enemy weapons captured after an engagement, and that turned out to be a good predictor of casualties, with certain limits.

==Earthquakes==
{{main|Earthquake casualty estimation}}
Recent advances are improving the speed and accuracy of loss estimates immediately after [[earthquakes]] (within less than an hour) so that injured people may be rescued more efficiently. After major and large earthquakes, rescue agencies and [[civil defense]] managers rapidly need quantitative estimates of the extent of the potential disaster, at a time when information from the affected area may not yet have reached the outside world. For the injured below the rubble every minute counts.
To rapidly provide estimates of the extent of an earthquake disaster is much less of a problem in industrialized than in developing countries. This article focuses on how one can estimate earthquake losses in developing countries in real time.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1342">'''Charitable prom organizations''' are groups, primarily in the [[United States]], that give away [[prom]] dresses to high school girls who may not be able to otherwise afford them.  One such group, [[The Glass Slipper Project]], works with [[Chicago]] area girls.  The project has been discussed on the website for ''[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]]''&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oprah.com/uyl/volunteer/children/vol_children_atrisk_08.jhtml]&lt;/ref&gt; and in the ''[[Chicago Tribune]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/lifestyle/chi-0402230203feb23,0,4053973.story?coll=chi-leisuretempo-hed]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[The Perfect Prom Project]] is active at the [[University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign]].   

Charitable prom organizations in the US are listed on donatemydress.org.&lt;ref&gt;[http://donatemydress.org donatemydress.org]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110304054952/http://donatemydress.org/ |date=March 4, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some prom retail stores are also charitable prom organizations.  Synchronicity Boutique &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.synchronicityboutique.com www.synchronicityboutique.com]&lt;/ref&gt; donated over $10,700 to 240 local high schools that purchased dresses from their store in Baltimore.

==Girl child==
Conditions that increases the risk of girl-child sexual assault in Nigeria can be found in schools, [[Child harvesting|baby factories]] and the practice of child labour. Studies conducted in Nigeria disclose that young girls are victims in majority of reported assault cases in hospitals. A four-year review of sexual assault cases at [[Lagos University Teaching Hospital|LASUTH]] that began in 2008 and ended in December 2012, showed that out of a total 287 reported cases of sexual assault, 83% of the victims were below the age of 19.&lt;ref&gt;Akinlusi FM, Rabiu KA, Olawepo TA, Adewunmi AA, Ottun TA, Akinola OI.

===Child labour===
One of the traditional means of [[socialization]] of children is through trading.{{sfn|Ebigbo|2003|p=97}} However, the introduction of young girls into street trading increases the vulnerabilities of the girls to sexual harassment. Sexual abuse of young girls in Nigeria is linked [[Girl Child Labour in Nigeria|child labour]].{{sfn|Ebigbo|2003|p=104}}

{{see also|Child labor|Military use of children}}
'''Children' rights in Colombia''' ({{lang-es|Derechos de los niños en Colombia}}) is the status of [[children's rights]] in the [[Republic of Colombia]]. Colombia signed the [[Convention on the Rights of the Child]] in 1989 and later ratified the CRC on September 2, 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.colombiaaprende.edu.co/html/home/1592/article-76046.html {{es icon}} Colombiaaprende.edu.co: Unidos por los niños y las niñas]&lt;/ref&gt; Internally issues related to children are mostly under the ''[[Instituto Colombiano de Bienestar Familiar]]'', or the ICBF, which is translated as the Colombian Institute for Family Welfare.

The average school-leaving age in Colombia is 12. The numerous [[Wars involving Colombia|internal conflicts]] in which Colombia has been involved, has used children for combat related duties throughout the years, as well as political, social and economic instability have pushed for child labor. More recently the current [[Colombian armed conflict|internal armed conflict]], while the government enforces the enlistment of adults in the military under the legal age, 18-year-olds, the [[guerrilla movements in Colombia|guerrillas]] and [[Paramilitarism in Colombia|paramilitary groups]] resort to the recruitment, sometimes forced, of children for combat. Between 11,000 and 14,000 children are estimated to be involved with left-wing guerrilla groups and right-wing paramilitaries in [[Colombia]]. According to [[Human Rights Watch]], "Approximately 80 percent of child combatants in Colombia belong to one of the two left-wing guerrilla groups, the [[Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia|FARC]] or [[National Liberation Army (Colombia)|ELN]]. The remainder fights in [[paramilitary]] ranks."&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrw.org/english/docs/2005/02/22/colomb10202.htm Colombia: Armed Groups Send Children to War] [[Human Rights News]] a website of [[Human Rights Watch]] February 22, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover the children are also affected by the violence of war and the forced displacement that has come with it. Colombia has one of the highest number of victims of [[land mine]]s in the world, most of the victims being children.

== Emmanuel ==
In 2002, FARC guerrillas kidnapped presidential candidate [[Ingrid Betancourt]] and secretary [[Clara Rojas]]. A general rumor spread that Rojas was pregnant in captivity after a relationship with a guerrilla leader. This was later confirmed by [[John Frank Pinchao]], a policeman who was also in captivity under the FARC along Betancourt and Rojas and escaped. Pinchao said that Rojas had a child in captivity named Emmanuel and he was being raised by the guerrillas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.liberenaemmanuel.org/welcome/ Free Emmanuel] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071010113220/http://www.liberenaemmanuel.org/welcome/ |date=October 10, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Child sexual abuse===
Child pornography and [[Sexual slavery|sexual exploitation]] are issues in Colombia. Children are mainly affected by [[Poverty in Colombia|poverty]] and end up in local brothels; others are placed into regional and international prostitution trade networks. These networks are often run by bigger cartels associated to [[Illegal drug trade in Colombia|illegal drug trade]], weapons smuggling, and counterfeiting. Children end up in local brothels; others are placed into regional and international prostitution trade networks. These networks are often run by bigger syndicates also involved in narcotics, weapons, and counterfeiting. Children may be traded to neighboring countries like Venezuela, or to markets in countries as distant as Spain or Germany.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wunrn.com/news/2007/09_07/09_17_07/092307_colombia.htm womensnewsnetwork WUNRN: “A Child in Danger is a Child that Cannot Wait” – Colombia and Child Prostitution in Today’s World] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080514123606/http://www.wunrn.com/news/2007/09_07/09_17_07/092307_colombia.htm |date=May 14, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Children may be traded to neighboring countries like [[Venezuela]], or to markets in countries in [[Europe]], the [[Middle East]] or [[Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.semana.com/wf_InfoArticulo.aspx?idArt=107846 {{es icon}} Revista Semana: Child commercial sexual violence is the third illegal most lucrative business in the world]&lt;/ref&gt;

The determination of the overall effectiveness of force employment during military operations. Combat assessment is composed of three major components:
*[[battle damage assessment]] (BDA)
*[[munitions effects assessment]]
*[[reattack recommendation]].

The GS-3 is normally the single point of contact for combat assessment at the joint force level, assisted by the joint force GS-2.

{{Criminal defenses}}
{{Tort law|defenses}}

The '''defence of property''' is a common method of [[Justification (jurisprudence)|justification]] used by [[Legal defense|defendants]] who argue that they should not be held liable for any loss and injury that they have caused because they were acting to protect their [[property]]. [[Court]]s have generally ruled that the [[use of force]] may be acceptable.

==English Law==
Generally, see [[self-defence in English law]]. In addition to the right of self-defence at [[common law]], section 3 of the [[Criminal Law Act 1967]] states that
:A person may use such force as is reasonable in the circumstances in the prevention of crime or in arresting offenders or suspects.

Insofar as an attack on property is a crime, reasonable force may be used to prevent the crime or to arrest the offender, whether it be [[theft]] of a sum of money or the [[Criminal Damage Act 1971|damage]] of an object. In many cases of [[robbery]] and [[burglary]], the threat will be to both a person and property, and this combination can be a powerful defence. In ''AG's Reference (No 2 of 1983)'' (1984) 1 AER 988&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII | litigants =Attorney-General's Reference No 2 of 1983 | link = | country = | court = EWCA | division = Crim | year = 1984 | num = 1 | para = | eucase = | parallelcite = [1984] QB 456  | date = 3 February 1984 | courtname = [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] | juris = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lane CJ. held that a defendant who manufactured ten petrol bombs to defend his shop during the [[Toxteth Riots]] could set up the defence of showing that he possessed an explosive substance "for a lawful purpose" if he could show he acted to protect himself or his family or property by means he believed reasonably necessary to meet the attack. In theory, the defence of property by itself cannot reasonably provide a justification for inflicting serious injury, but there are a number of cases approving considerable violence to arrest criminals threatening property.

Although ''R v Scully'' (1824) 171 ER 1213 held that it was not justifiable to shoot an intruder merely to arrest him, on the facts, “the life of the prisoner was threatened, and if he considered his life in actual danger, he was justified in shooting the deceased as he had done; but if, not considering his own life in danger, he rashly shot this man, who was only a trespasser, he would be guilty of manslaughter.” See [[self-defence (Australia)]] for a comparative view on whether the use of excessive force causing death should give rise to a mitigatory defence and "Reform" below. In ''Mead and Belt's Case'' (1823) 68 ER 1006. Holroyd J. instructed a jury that violence could not be used against a civil trespasser, adding: “But, the making an attack upon a dwelling, and especially at night, the law regards as equivalent to an assault on a man's person; for a man's house is his castle and therefore, in the eye of the law, it is equivalent to an assault."

One recent case on using force against a burglar is ''[[Tony Martin (farmer)|Anthony Martin]] v R'' (2001) EWCA 2245,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII | litigants = Martin v R | link = Tony Martin (farmer) | country = | court = EWCA | division = Crim | year = 2001 | num = 2245 | para = | eucase = | parallelcite = [2002] 2 WLR 1, [2002] 1 Cr App R 27, [2003] QB 1 | date = 30 October 2001 | courtname = [[Court of Appeal of England and Wales|Court of Appeal]] | juris = }}&lt;/ref&gt; which resulted in the householder being convicted. As the law currently stands, a person in possession can use no more force than they reasonably believe necessary to remove a trespasser from the premises. Further, where the threat to the land or its possession is not immediate, and other measures could be taken that would make force unnecessary (e.g., calling the police or seeking remedies through the courts) the defence will normally be lost. But in ''Chamberlain v Lindon'' (1998) 1 WLR 1252&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII | litigants = Chamberlain v Lindon | link = | country = | court = EWHC | division = Admin | year = 1998 | num = 329| para = | eucase = | parallelcite = | date = 18 March 1998 | courtname = [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] | juris = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lindon demolished a wall to protect a [[right of way (public throughway)|right-of-way]], honestly believing that it was a reasonable means of protecting his property (and, incidentally, avoiding litigation). It was held that it was not necessary to decide whether Lindon’s action was justified as a matter of civil law.

For the purpose of the criminal law, what mattered was whether Lindon believed that his actions were reasonable. Although this case is on the specific interpretation of the statutory defence under s5 [[Criminal Damage Act 1971]], the fact that the defendant was not out of time after nine months of inaction is interesting. On a similar statutory defence, ''DPP v Bayer and Others'' (2004) 1 Cr. App. R. 493&lt;ref&gt;{{cite BAILII | litigants = Director of Public Prosecutions v Bayer &amp; Ors | link = | country = | court = EWHC | division = Admin | year = 2003 | num = 2567 | para = | eucase = | parallelcite = [2004] 1 WLR 2856  | date = 4 November  | courtname = [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] | juris = }}&lt;/ref&gt; dealt with defence of private property as a defence to aggravated trespass under section 68 of the [[Criminal Justice and Public Order Act 1994]].

The court held that if defendants argued they had used reasonable force to defend property from actual or imminent damage that would constitute a criminal act, then the court had to consider whether, on the facts as the defendants honestly believed them to be, the force used was reasonable in all the circumstances.

==Reform==

The defence of "private defence" or "protective force," when unlawful force is used or threatened against a person who may use proportionate force to defend persons or property, is distinguished from the line of authority concerned with a similar defence against trespassers. In the Law Commission's Report No. 218 ''Offences Against the Person and General Principles'' (1993)&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!-- {{cite BAILII}} only works for case reports --&gt; ''Legislating the Criminal Code: Offences against the Person and General Principles (Report)'' [http://www.bailii.org/ew/other/EWLC/1993/218.html &amp;#x5b;1993&amp;#x5d; EWLC 218] (1 January 1993)&lt;/ref&gt; at pp 106–110) these defences are set out (so far as they relate to defence of property) as follows:
:27(i) The use of force by a person for any of the following purposes, if only such as is reasonable in the circumstances as he believes them to be, does not constitute an offence:
::(c) to protect his property... from trespass;
::(d) to protect property belonging to another from . . . damage caused by a criminal act or (with the authority of the other) from trespass...
:29(i) For the purposes of s 27...
::(a) a person uses force in relation to... property not only where he applies force to, but also where he causes an impact on,... that property;"

'''''Dishonored: Death of the Outsider''''' is an [[Action-adventure game|action-adventure]] [[Stealth game|stealth]] [[video game]] developed by [[Arkane Studios]] and published by [[Bethesda Softworks]]. It is a standalone expansion pack following ''[[Dishonored 2]]'', and was released 15 September 2017 on [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]]. It follows former-assassin Billie Lurk as she finds her mentor Daud and aids in his quest to kill [[The Outsider (Dishonored)|the Outsider]], a supernatural being who bestows magical powers on a select few.

==Gameplay==
The gameplay is more or less the same as in ''[[Dishonored]]'' and ''[[Dishonored 2]]''. The player is equipped with a short sword.  If the player sneaks up on a foe, they can stab them to death quickly and quietly. The player also has other gear, such as a wrist-mounted crossbow, land mines, and grenades.  A new piece of gear in this game is the hook mine, which grabs a nearby enemy and knocks them unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/dishonored-2-death-of-the-outsiders-hook-mines-look-very-cool/ |title=Dishonored 2 Death of the Outsider's Hook Mines look very, very cool |last=Donnelly |first=Joe |date=6 September 2017 |work=PC Gamer |access-date=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the first mission, the player gains access to three supernatural abilities. Unlike previous games in the series, the player does not purchase them with "runes"; they are all fully unlocked from the start. These abilities cost energy to use, but unlike in the previous games, the player's energy regenerates fully on its own; there are no energy-replenishing consumables.

Lurk's main mobility power is "Displace", which allows her to set a marker in the world, and then teleport that marker at any time.&lt;ref name="Displace"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pcgamer.com/billies-displace-ability-sounds-awesome-in-dishonored-2-death-of-the-outsider/ |title=Billie's 'displace' ability sounds awesome in Dishonored 2: Death of the Outsider |last=Donnelly |first=Joe |date=13 June 2017 |work=[[PC Gamer]] |access-date=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; "Semblance" allows the player to take the faces of living NPCs and use them as a temporary disguise, though they can only take a character's face once. The disguise drains power as the player moves, but not when they are standing still.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.rockpapershotgun.com/2017/09/15/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider-best-power/ |title=Evasion of the bodysnatcher in Dishonored: Death Of The Outsider |last=Meer |first=Alec |date=15 September 2017 |work=Rock, Paper, Shotgun |access-date=25 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Using Semblance on specific named NPCs may produce unique interactions. Completing the game unlocks an "original game plus" mode, where the player has access to some powers featured in ''[[Dishonored 2]]''.&lt;ref name="Displace"/&gt;

As in the previous games, the player can collect "bonecharms", which are scattered throughout the levels.  Wearing a bonecharm provides minor upgrades to the player's abilities.

During missions, the player may pick up optional "Contracts" at black markets, which are side missions that involve doing tasks such as assassinating another character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.engadget.com/2017/08/26/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider/ |title='Dishonored' gets unleashed in 'Death of the Outsider' |last=Hardawar |first=Devindra |date=26 August 2017 |publisher=Engadget |access-date=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In one example, the character is tasked with killing a mime and making it look like a suicide.&lt;ref name="Cut Loose"/&gt;

==Plot==

After the events of ''[[Dishonored 2]]'', Emily Kaldwin is reinstated as empress and begins to salvage the Empire previously broken by Delilah's rule. Billie Lurk wakes aboard her ship, the Dreadful Wale, having a recurring nightmare regarding her right arm and eye. Billie has tracked down her old mentor Daud's whereabouts to a boxing club in Albarca Baths. She makes her way to Daud's location, finding that the boxing club is run by a Void-worshiping cult called the Eyeless.

Lurk witnesses Daud being restrained by a special device that cancels out his Void-given powers. She disables the device, thereby freeing Daud. Daud is happy to see Billie and asks for her help in one last job: killing the Outsider, to which Lurk agrees. On board the Dreadful Wale, Daud explains that the Eyeless are in possession of a ritual knife, a special blade that was originally used to create the Outsider thousands of years ago. Daud surmises that the blade will allow Billie to kill the Outsider. Billie is then visited by the Outsider, who gives her a cryptic message, whilst simultaneously replacing her right arm with a Void-made arm, and her eye with a special red artifact, the Sliver of the Eye. The arm gives Lurk supernatural abilities.

Billie makes her way into the city once again to investigate the leadership of the Eyeless. Upon figuring out the identities of the leaders, Billie steals two keys to a safety deposit box in Karnaca's largest bank. She is able to infiltrate the bank and steal the knife, while also discovering that one of the Eyeless' leaders attempted to abandon the group and hid important documents in the Royal Conservatory. Once Billie retrieves the knife, the Outsider appears and explains that he knows more than most, revealing that Daud had died of natural causes aboard the Dreadful Wale while Billie was on the heist, much to her dismay. She returns to the Dreadful Wale and cremates her mentor's deceased body, thus also burning down the Dreadful Wale (an anagram of 'Farewell Daud').

Billie then infiltrates the Royal Conservatory, where she finds the documents. They detail the location of a Void portal at an abandoned mine outside Karnaca. Billie travels to the mine, which is now overseen and operated by the Cult that originally created the Outsider. The Cult members discuss occult sciences while marveling at the Void creatures walking about near the dig site. Billie learns from their notes that the Mark of the Outsider is actually his name, written in an esoteric script that only the dead can read. Billie makes her way to an artifact called the Eye of the Dead God and absorbs it, allowing her to safely enter the Void portal.

Once inside the Void, Billie makes her way to the Ritual Hold, where the Outsider resides. There she finds the Outsider, seemingly bound and immobile. Billie is then given a choice, to either return the Outsider to the mortal realm by having Daud's Void spirit pronounce the Outsider's real name to him, or to use the ritual knife to kill the Outsider. Either way, the Outsider is displaced, and Billie acknowledges that with the Outsider gone, the world will be changed in innumerable ways. However, the Void will continue to exist and there is no longer anybody who can decide who will gain its power.

==Development==
Dinga Bakaba, lead designer of ''[[Dishonored 2]]'', was one of the initial voices for making the ''Death of the Outsider'' standalone.&lt;ref name="Cut Loose"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamespot.com/articles/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider-lets-players-cut-/1100-6452891/ |title=Dishonored: Death Of The Outsider Lets Players Cut Loose As It Closes Out The Main Story |last=Fillari |first=Alessandro |date=26 August 2017 |publisher=GameSpot |access-date=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game removes the chaos system featured in previous games, which tracked how many characters the player killed and altered the world depending on if the player had a high bodycount.&lt;ref name="Cut Loose"/&gt; Developers felt that removing the need to find elixirs, which were previously required to fully restore energy, encouraged players to experiment more with the full range of powers. Giving all the powers at once was "liberating" for Arkane, as they knew the full extent of what any player could do at any point in the game.&lt;ref name="End"/&gt; Time restraints meant that levels couldn't all be "themed" in the same way ''Dishonored 2''{{'}}s levels were, though some levels are intended to make the player rely on different powers than others.&lt;ref name="End"/&gt; Co-creative director Harvey Smith had immediate concerns about the semblance power when it was first pitched, as he felt implementing the idea appropriately would take an excessive amount of work; ultimately the full extent and ramifications of the power were reduced to more "manageable" levels, and Smith was glad for its inclusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pcgamesn.com/dishonored-2/dishonored-death-of-the-outsider-semblance |title=Dishonored: Death of the Outsider delivers on the social stealth we were promised a decade ago |last=Peel |first=Jeremy |date=29 August 2017 |publisher=PCGamesN |access-date=3 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Death of the Outsider'' is meant to bring an end to "the Kaldwin era", an arc that began in the first ''[[Dishonored]]'' with the assassination of Jessamine Kaldwin and followed characters involved with it, such as [[Corvo Attano]] and [[Emily Kaldwin]].&lt;ref name="End"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2017/08/23/gamescom-2017-why-death-of-the-outsider-is-the-end-of-dishonored-as-we-know-it |title=Gamescom 2017: Why Death of the Outsider is the End of Dishonored as We Know It |last=O'Brien |first=Lucy |date=23 August 2017 |publisher=IGN |access-date=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Whether any future ''Dishonored'' games will be made is undecided, but would feature different characters as their protagonists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uk.ign.com/articles/2017/08/25/quakecon-2017-future-dishonored-games-would-feature-different-characters |title=Quakecon 2017: Future Dishonored Games Would Feature Different Characters |last=Osborn |first=Alex |date=25 August 2017 |publisher=IGN |access-date=2 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[IGN]]'s Tom Marks considered it "a worthy end", but felt it didn't reach the "high bar" of ''Dishonored 2''. Marks praised the "wonderfully detailed" levels and the encouragement to use abilities more liberally, though expressed mixed feelings at the removal of the Chaos system and lack of character progression.&lt;ref name="IGN" /&gt; Alessandro Fillari at ''[[GameSpot]]'' gave the game a positive review, praising the level design and individual missions, while also criticizing the story, stating that "while starting strong, the story eventually runs out of steam."&lt;ref name="game_spot" /&gt;

''[[GamesRadar+]]'' ranked it 19th on their list of the 25 Best Games of 2017.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.gamesradar.com/best-games-2017/ |title=The best games of 2017 |author=GamesRadar staff |date=22 December 2017 |website=[[GamesRadar+]] |publisher=[[Future plc]] |accessdate=25 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Enets people''' ({{lang-ru|энцы}}, ''entsy''; singular: {{lang|ru|энец}}, ''enets''), or Yenetses, Entsy, Entsi, Yenisei, Yenisei-Samoyed, Yenisey Samoyeds or Yeniseian people are a [[indigenous people|traditionally nomadic people]] who live on the east bank, near the mouth, of the [[Yenisei River]]. Many live in the village of [[Potapovo]] in [[Krasnoyarsk Krai]] in western [[Siberia]] near the [[Arctic Circle]]. According to the [[Russian Census (2010)|2010 Census]], there are 227&amp;nbsp;Enets in [[Russia]]. In [[Ukraine]], there were 26&amp;nbsp;Entsi in 2001, of whom&amp;nbsp;18 were capable of speaking the language.

The [[Enets language]] is a [[Samoyedic languages|Samoyedic]] language, formerly known as Yenisei Samoyedic (not to be confused with the [[Yeniseian languages|Yeniseian]] language family, which is completely unrelated). They still speak their language, but education is in Russian so there is fear they may lose their language.
==Current situation==
British travel writer [[Colin Thubron]] visited the town of Potapovo in the late 1990s and found the Entsi deculturated and demoralized, beset with problems of [[alcoholism]]. The [[reindeer]] [[collective farm|collective]] established in [[Nikita Khrushchev]]'s day had been severely impacted by [[acid rain]] from the [[nickel]] [[smelter]]s at [[Norilsk]]. A [[fur farm]] that raises [[fox]] was similarly diminished. About half the population was unemployed with a few employed in [[reindeer]] herding on the west side of the river, the remainder living by fishing in the Yenisei River. Fisherman from Potapovo sometimes catch red [[sturgeon]] and ''[[Omul]]'', a type of [[salmon]], as well as [[Salvelinus|char]], [[gang fish]], and [[northern pike]]. Thubron mentions a salted [[muksun]] fish product.

Some social services continue to be provided by the Russian government: a small hospital, with a doctor and a few nurses; schools (although older children must attend in [[Dudinka]] to the north); and small [[Russian government]] [[pension]]s. The electric plant had recently burned and electricity was provided intermittently by a generator. Life expectancy is 45 with many dying violent deaths due to family violence and fighting.

| [[County Londonderry|Derry]]
| 1613/1585

Calgach may have been [[Calgacus]]. The name may come from [[Proto-Celtic]] ''*calg-ac-os,'' "Possessing a Blade" or "Possessing a Penis".
The prefix "London" was added in 1613, after the town had been rebuilt across the river from its previous site, in recognition of donations from the livery companies of the City of London which had enabled the English and Scottish settlers to colonise the site. This was the same time as the County was formed. There is [[Derry/Londonderry name dispute|some dispute]] over whether to use the name Londonderry or Derry.
Most of the area for County Londonderry came from the previous [[County Coleraine]], which was formed in 1585. Coleraine comes from ''Cúil Raithin'', "Nook of the Ferns".

|-  align="left"
| [[County Monaghan|Monaghan]]
| 1585

"Muine" means "brake" (a thickly overgrown area) or "hillock", hence the county council's interpretation as "land of the little hills".

| 1607
| [[Leinster]]

[[Image:1901 Eastern Telegraph cables.png|300px|thumb|[[Eastern Telegraph]] cable network in 1901]]
A '''global network''' is any [[communication network]] which spans the entire [[Earth]]. The term, as used in this article refers in a more restricted way to ''bidirectional'' communication networks, and to technology-based networks. Early networks such as [[international mail]] and unidirectional communication networks, such as [[radio network|radio]] and [[television network|television]], are described elsewhere.

The first global network was established using [[electrical telegraph]]y and global span was achieved in 1899. The [[public switched telephone network|telephony network]] was the second to achieve global status, in the 1950s. More recently, interconnected [[IP network]]s (principally the [[Internet]], with estimated 2.5 billion users worldwide in 2014 &lt;ref&gt;http://export.gov/northcarolina/build/groups/public/@eg_us_nc/documents/webcontent/komarketingpresentation065541.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;), and the [[GSM]] [[mobile communication]] network (with over 6 billion worldwide users in 2014) form the largest global networks of all.

Setting up global networks requires immensely costly and lengthy efforts lasting for decades. Elaborate interconnections, [[Telephone exchange|switching]] and [[routing]] devices, laying out physical carriers of information, such as land and [[submarine communications cable|submarine cables]] and [[earth station]]s must be set in operation. In addition, international [[communication protocol]]s, legislation and agreements are involved.

Global networks might also refer to networks of individuals (such as [[Scientific collaboration network|scientists]]), communities (such as [[city network|cities]]) and organizations (such as [[Civil society#Global|civil organizations]]) worldwide which, for instance, might have formed for the management, mitigation and resolval of [[global issue]]s.

==Satellite global networks==

[[Communication satellite]]s are an important part of global networks. However, there are specific [[low Earth orbit]] (LEO) global [[satellite constellation]]s, such as [[Iridium satellite constellation|Iridium]], [[Globalstar]] and [[Orbcomm]], which are comprised by dozens of similar satellites which are put in orbit at regularly spaced positions and form a [[mesh network]], sometimes sending and receiving information directly among themselves. Using [[VSAT]] technology, [[satellite internet access]] has become possible.

==Mobile wireless networks==

It is estimated that 80% of the global mobile market uses the GSM standard, present in more than 212 countries and territories. Its [[wikt:ubiquity|ubiquity]] makes international [[roaming]] very common between mobile phone operators, enabling subscribers to use their phones in many parts of the world. In order to achieve this, these networks must be interconnected by way of [[peering]] arrangements, and therefore the GSM network is a truly global one.

==Network interconnection==

The telegraph and [[telex]] communication networks have been phased out, so [[interconnection]] among existing global networks arise at several points, such as between the voice [[telephony]] and digital [[data network]]s, and between these and satellite networks. Many applications run now on several networks, such as [[VoIP]] (voice over IP). [[Mobile communication]] (voice and data) networks are also intimately intertwinned, because the majority of 21st century [[cell phone]]s have both voice and data (internet navigation and [[email]]ing) capabilities.

Digital global networks require huge carrying capacity in the main [[internet backbone|backbone]]s. This is currently achieved by [[fiber optic cable]]s.

==Social and economic impact==
The Canadian [[sociologist]] [[Marshall McLuhan]] was the first to forecast the huge impact of the matrix of global networks upon [[society]], coining the term [[global village (term)|global village]]. His work, however, related to radio and television networks, which are [[broadcast]] (unidirectional) networks, thus predating the much larger impact of the internet.&lt;ref&gt;Harasim, L. (Ed.) - [https://books.google.com/books?id=9RAnJzaiqvMC Global Networks: Computers and International Networks, 1993]&lt;/ref&gt;

Global networks have revolutionized human communication several times. The first to do so was the electrical telegraph. Its impact was so large that it has been dubbed the [[Victorian Internet]]. It was expanded many times in its coverage with the advent of [[radiotelegraphy]], and with text messaging using [[telex]] machines.

The Internet and mobile communication networks have made possible entirely new forms of [[social interaction]], activities and organizing, thanks to its basic features such as widespread [[usability]] and access, and instant communication from any connected point to another. Thus, its [[Internet#Social impact|social impact]] has been, and still is, enormous. Finally, the impact on governance have been significant facilitating the emergence of 'transnational policy networks' &lt;ref&gt;Stone, Diane. Knowledge actors and transnational governance: The private-public policy nexus in the global agora. Palgrave Macmillan, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are over 50,000 '''Iraqis in the Netherlands''', including immigrants from Iraq and locally born people of Iraqi heritage, constiting 0.3% of the total population in the Netherlands. Some sources claim an estimation of 60,000 people of Iraqi descent living in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jenniferhamm.com/profiles_iraqis.html Jennifer Hamm :: Freelance Journalist&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; The Iraqi community in the Netherlands is the 4th largest and has the highest percentage of qualified and professional people and artistes who have integrated well and have become useful members of the Dutch society.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safara.info/English/2.htm :: Safara.info :: Iraqi Embassy in the Hague ::&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Migration history==
The first wave of immigrants was in 1992, the data confirm duo this phenomenon, which rose gradually to reach a peak in 1998. 19.5 per cent of the interviewees from study report came in that year. While 13.5 per cent in 1999. However, numbers have decreased in 2003 and 2004, which was 1 per cent, and in 1992, the proportion was 2 per cent.&lt;ref name=StudyReportIraqiComInNetherlands&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nsv-sociologie-facta.nl/activiteiten/dvds2007/papers/The%20Iraqi%20Community%20in%20the%20Netherlands.doc |title=Study Report of the Iraqi Community in the Netherlands |accessdate=2008-02-14 |publisher=nsv-sociologie-facta.nl }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Iraqi community in the Netherlands has increased from 8,000 in 1995 to approximately 40,000 in 2002. Apart from this group, there is an unknown number of Iraqis illegally staying in the Netherlands.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fas.org/irp/world/netherlands/aivd2002.pdf Iraqi migration to the Netherlands]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main motives of the Iraqi migration are political asylum seeking resulting previous conditions in Iraq regarding the nature of the former regime, and the circumstances of successive wars and the economic embargo which was imposed on Iraq.

==Demography==
A recent study report, shows that two-thirds of the Iraqi community in the Netherlands are young and well qualified to work in the various fields of life. However, many of which are unemployed despite being well educated. The level of integration of the Iraqi community with the Dutch people is noticeably low. It amounts to a quarter out of the standards of social integration. The level of mastery of the Dutch language and of the participation in the social and political activities is quite low. The commitment to the mother culture with its Islamic, Arab and Iraqi references is quite high.
Judging by gender of the Iraqi population, it has been assessed that 60 per cent are males and females account for 40 per cent.&lt;ref name=StudyReportIraqiComInNetherlands/&gt;

Most of the Iraqi community are younger age groups and qualify for the labor market, the age categories are between 26-35 and 36–45 years, they were 28 per cent for each category. This reflects the new age of the Iraqi community in the Netherlands, which also means that most members of this community are first generation.&lt;ref name=StudyReportIraqiComInNetherlands/&gt;

With regard to the marital status, the largest proportion of whom are married is at 58 per cent, this figure represents 53 per cent males and 68 per cent females. Due to a lot of Iraqi women coming to the Netherlands because of family reunification, whether married already or later. The (non or never married) was accounted for 25 per cent.&lt;ref name=StudyReportIraqiComInNetherlands/&gt;

There is a good proportion of inter-marriage between members of the Iraqi community in the Netherlands and Dutch or others. The proportion is 12.5 per cent with Dutch people, that was among 13 cases of Iraqi men with Dutch women and 4 cases of Iraqi women married from  Dutch men. The rest is refers to some cases with foreigners. While the highest rate of marriage represents 81 per cent of the same country (Iraq).&lt;ref name=StudyReportIraqiComInNetherlands/&gt;

There is a high level of friendship relations between Iraqi immigrants and the Dutch people. There is no divergence for Iraqis in accordance with their religious background of both Muslims and Christians to build a friendship with the Dutch. Where equal ratio between them is 70 per cent for each part. While the proportion of the non-believers is 100 per cent, which reflects the overcome on some reservations expressed by some immigrants from religious background.

==Education==

The rate of education to the Iraqi community, whether men or women is high and over that with Moroccans, Surinamese and comparing with the Dutch people too.&lt;ref name=StudyReportIraqiComInNetherlands/&gt; According to the study, the total holding higher degrees (High Institute, Bachelor's, Master's and Ph.D.) are 54 per cent. While the rest carry secondary school and below certificates. 
However, there was a low proportion of Iraqis who obtained diploma’s and certificates from the Netherlands. The proportion is 21 per cent for various academic levels. But the percentage is higher for a secondary certificate, it is not a high level compared with other graduates from Iraq who made up 69 per cent. That means that most holders of these certificates are younger ages in the community study, or second generation.&lt;ref name=StudyReportIraqiComInNetherlands/&gt;

==Employment==
There is a high rate of the unemployment among Iraqi immigrants, 40 per cent of whom are unemployed, compared with only 13 per cent who officially work and 12 per cent free work. Unemployment is also concentrated among people who are higher educated, especially university graduates, while lower percentage is among other educational levels.&lt;ref name=StudyReportIraqiComInNetherlands/&gt;

==Language==
There is a low percentage of Iraqis who use the Dutch language in their homes through their dealings with their children and parents. The proportion was only 17.5 per cent. Meanwhile, there is 47.5 per cent who do not use it at all. According to results of the study, the majority of interviewees (62 per cent) have impression that the Dutch language is (difficult). Compared with 30 per cent of them who felt that it is (reasonable to learn). While only 7 per cent said it is (easy).&lt;ref name=StudyReportIraqiComInNetherlands/&gt;

'''John Dougan''' ({{lang-ru|Джон Марк Дуган}}) is a former police officer who fled the [[United States]] for [[Moscow]], [[Russia]] to obtain [[political asylum]] in 2016. Dougan was running a website that had been critical of Ric Bradshaw, the [[sheriff]] of [[Palm Beach County, Florida]]. Dougan fled after his home was raided by law enforcement authorities on March 14, 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Swisher |first1=Skyler |title=Critic of Palm Beach County sheriff says FBI searched his home in probe of computer hack |url=http://www.sun-sentinel.com/local/palm-beach/fl-palm-fbi-hack-raid-20160314-story.html |accessdate=5 October 2018 |publisher=Sun Sentinel |date=14 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dougan stated that after the raid on his home, the FBI was following him and his family, so he decided to flee the country. He wore various disguises and snuck into Canada to avoid U.S. Customs, which he suspected had him on a [[no-fly list]]. Dougan then took a flight from [[Toronto]] to [[Istanbul]], and boarded another flight to his final destination, Moscow, Russia.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ntv.ru/novosti/1622358/|title="Достало!": американский полицейский объяснил свое желание переехать в Россию|website=НТВ|language=Russian|trans-title="Enough!": American policeman explained his desire to move to Russia|access-date=2016-05-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Dougan started his website, PBSOtalk.org, and began making public records requests based on tips from readers and anonymous posters on the website. In 2012, he received information and public records, that the elected Sheriff of Palm Beach County was using taxpayer money to take campaign contributors, some with ties to organized crime. After filing a complaint with the Florida Commission on Ethics, the Sheriff was cleared "because he didn't know it was a violation of the law." However, the Commission stated the money he used to take those people to dinner was "inconsistent with the proper performance of his public duties".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/palm-beach-county-sheriff-ric-bradshaw-chided-for-/nN2sx/|title=Palm Beach County Sheriff Ric Bradshaw chided for using tax money|work= [[The Palm Beach Post]] |access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the ethics complaint was filed, the Chief Deputy of Palm Beach County filed a lawsuit against Dougan &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/sheriffs-office-second-in-command-files-defamation/nPKbn/|title=Sheriff's Office second-in-command files defamation lawsuit|work= The Palm Beach Post|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; after the Sheriff's office tried unsuccessfully to purchase the web site from Dougan.

In what was billed as a digital election-day dirty trick the night before the November 2012 elections,&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/local-govt-politics/aaronson-denies-sending-email-blasting-bradshaw-in/nRBJ9/|title=Aaronson seeks investigation into faux email blasting Bradshaw...|work= The Palm Beach Post|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; an email was sent out to the A-list of voters in Palm Beach County from BurtAaronson.com, a domain owned by Dougan. The email stated that BurtAaronson.com no longer endorsed the Sheriff as a candidate and instead endorsed the other candidate in the race. The real Burt Aaronson, who was, at the time, a county commissioner, stated he was outraged and had no knowledge of the email. He accused Dougan of identity theft, and attempted to have Dougan arrested. The Palm Beach County State Attorney's office, however, determined since Dougan owned the domain, he was legally justified in using it, however, called the email "outrageous conduct," further saying that laws have not kept up with mischief that can be wreaked on the Internet.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In 2015, Dougan obtained and posted a collection of audio recordings of a Palm Beach County detective speaking to an unidentified woman. The recordings revealed targeted retaliations and investigations against the Sheriff's political enemies, including Dougan, that speak critically of the Sheriff.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.palmbeachpost.com/news/news/crime-law/deputy-who-said-he-went-after-bradshaws-enemies-in/nnRny/|title=Deputy who said he went after Bradshaw's enemies investigated|work= The Palm Beach Post|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The FBI and Palm Beach County raid on Dougan's home was motivated by the posting of these audio files, which was deemed to be wiretapping. The other reason listed on the warrant was for suspected hacking, and posting of names, of thousands of names, addresses and phone numbers of law enforcement officers, judges and FBI agents, though the property appraiser claimed nothing was ever hacked.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.mypalmbeachpost.com/news/news/crime-law/pbso-investigating-release-of-confidential-law-enf/nqRHw/|title=PBSO investigating release of confidential law enforcement addresses|last=Writer|first=By Lawrence Mower - Palm Beach Post Staff|website=www.mypalmbeachpost.com|access-date=2016-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dougan claimed it was merely a reason to seize his computers and attempt to locate the sources of his information as well as to shut down his web site.

==2016 Election Claims==
During the [[United States presidential election, 2016|2016 U.S. Presidential elections]], Dougan falsely claimed to have played a role in the leak of emails from the Democratic National Committee and the Hillary Clinton campaign.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Poulsen |first1=Kevin |title=Fugitive Cop Says He’s Behind the DNC Leaks.

'''John XIII College, Cochabamba''', [[Bolivia]], founded by the [[Jesuit|Jesuits]] in 1966, is a middle and high school that follows a work-study model. Most of its students are from low-income families in mining towns. 

== Educational model ==
Juan XXIII College is administered by the [[Society of Jesus]] and covers the sixth year of primary through four years of secondary school. It now follows the [[Fe y Alegría]] school model which originated in [[Venezuela]] in 1955. It caters to the poor, drawing its students from a wide area. The [[Inter-American Development Bank]] assisted in funding the extension of this model to more schools in Bolivia. John XIII graduates contributed to this effort.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://centroderecursos.alboan.org/ebooks/0000/0728/6_FyA_CAS.pdf|title=ALBOAN Aid Center |last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

John XIII took on this model in its fifth year of operation, in 1971, when Alfonso Pedrajas {"Pica") helped transform it, introducing to Bolivia a more socialist approach that creates a sense of solidarity and interdependence. He used the slogan: "Not students who work but workers who study." 

In 1976 Pica began admitting girls to the boarding school. He also increased the intake from outlying provinces and mining towns. Work is included in the curriculum and trade union leader [[Workers' Vanguard Party|Filemon Escóbar]] spent a time teaching at John XIII.  

In 1986, during a Latin American Congress of Fe y Alegría in [[Cochabamba]], John XXIII was named as a [[Latin America]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n model of education for production. The school along with its [[utopia]]&lt;nowiki/&gt;n vision have been described as "little new Bolivia".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://eju.tv/2009/03/alfonso-pedrajas/|title=Alfonso Pedrajas|website=eju.tv|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Graduates of John XIII and of the Jesuit [[Colegio San Calixto, La Paz]], while serving as Jesuit volunteers in Bolivia, have brought about growth of this educational model in Jesuit schools. Elements of the school model include parent participation, pay in kind for school expenses, use of peasant educators, and physical labor (fetching firewood and water and tending an orchard).  Evening activities include story reading and sharing personal histories. The model spread to Rodeo (1985),&lt;ref&gt;[http://chile.americasolidaria.org/informate/finalizamos-proyecto-de-rodeo-y-tiraque-en-bolivia/ School in Rodeo, Bolivia. Retrieved 17 December 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; Pampa (1987), and Churicana (1988).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.feyalegria.org/archivos/file/PromocionSocialEnLasYachayWasisDeBolivia_AidaFerreyra.pdf Fe y Alegria Bolivia archives. Retrieved 17 December 2016.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Colegio Juan XXIII uses a system of student self-government, with a student prime minister and other ministers, to enable students to experience democracy and to expand their social skills.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.entwicklung.at/en/themes/projects/detail-en/project/show/colegio-juan-xxiii-cochabambabolivien-und-salzburger-schulen-im-nord-sued-dialog/|title=Colegio Juan XXIII Cochabamba/Bolivien und Salzburger Schulen im Nord-Süd-Dialog- Austrian Development Agency|website=www.entwicklung.at|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Kc9xQ7-whQC&amp;pg=PA135&amp;lpg=PA135&amp;dq=Colegio+Juan+XXIII,+Cochabamba&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rTU2nNPQVn&amp;sig=F0aHTo1-ReZwH4_ob1SJMuoxzmw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiJ_NKXxfnQAhVK4CYKHVLHBPc4FBDoAQgmMAI#v=onepage&amp;q=Colegio%20Juan%20XXIII,%20Cochabamba&amp;f=false|title="El evangelio es la encarnación de los derechos humanos--": una respuesta a los ataques del MAS : la Iglesia Católica y su lucha por la recuperación de la democracia|date=2011-01-01|publisher=Plural editores|isbn=9789995413750|language=es}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Simon Education Foundation in 2007 initiated a Pilot Center for Technology Education in Cochabamba at John XIII that has served as a model for six other such centers in Bolivia; their first effort was training electricians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.simon.es/images/stories/simon/empresa/Simon|title=Simon Education Foundation|last=|first=|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=17 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Facilities include a coliseum, library, audio-visual rooms, two special education classrooms (serving 200 children with disabilities), and 24 ordinary classrooms.&lt;ref name="decom" /&gt;

==Alumni association==
On 19 November 1991 the National Association of Alumni of John XXIII College was formed, with working groups like "CEADES Health and Environment" which works toward improving health and environmental conditions, contributing to Bolivia's social development.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ceadesbolivia.org/institucion.aspx|title=CEADES :: Quienes Somos|website=www.ceadesbolivia.org|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://promoleonardoboff1985.blogspot.com/2011_03_01_archive.html|title=El juancho: ayer, hoy y posiblemente mañana|last=Antelo|first=Omar Quiroga|date=2011-03-15|website=Promoción Leonardo Boff 1985|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
John looks forward with nervous excitement to the annual Orange order march in [[Glasgow]], in which he will lead his local Orange Lodge band as mace-swinger. However, as the day progresses he begins to become disillusioned with the day and his colleagues, as he witnesses their growing drunkenness and unwarranted violence against [[Catholicism|Catholic]] homes on the march's route. Events of the day lead him to question his involvement with the band, which also threatens his own safety.

'''Languages''' spoken in the [[Serbia]]n province of '''[[Vojvodina]]''' include [[South Slavic languages]] ([[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Croatian language|Croatian]], [[Bunjevac language|Bunjevac]], [[Šokac language|Šokac]], [[Macedonian language|Macedonian]], [[Slovenian language|Slovenian]], [[Bulgarian language|Bulgarian]]), [[West Slavic languages]] ([[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Polish language|Polish]], and [[Czech language|Czech]]), [[East Slavic languages]] ([[Rusyn language|Rusyn]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]], [[Russian language|Russian]]), [[Hungarian language]], [[Romanian language]], [[German language]], [[Romani language]], [[Albanian language]], [[Chinese language]], etc.

==Historical overview==

It is unknown which languages were spoken in the territory of present-day Vojvodina in [[paleolithic]] and [[neolithic]] times. First speakers of [[Indo-European languages]] arrived here in 4200 BC and since the first written traces about this region appeared, there are records about speakers of various Indo-European languages that lived in this area, including speakers of [[Thracian languages|Thracian]], [[Illyrian languages|Illyrian]], [[Celtic languages|Celtic]], [[Iranian languages|Iranian]] and [[Italic languages|Italic]] branches of Indo-European language family. The decline and fall of the [[Roman Empire]] brought to this area speakers of [[Turkic languages|Turkic]] and [[Germanic languages|Germanic]] languages as well. Speakers of [[South Slavic languages]] settled in the area in the 6th century, while speakers of [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]] appeared in the 9th century. [[Ottoman Empire|Ottoman]] conquest of the region in the 16th century brought to this area speakers of [[Turkish language|Turkish]], [[Romani language|Romani]], and other languages, while [[Habsburg Monarchy|Habsburg]] conquest in the end of the 17th and first half of the 18th century brought here the speakers of [[German language|German]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Pannonian Rusyn language|Rusyn]], [[Czech language|Czech]], [[Ukrainian language|Ukrainian]] and other languages. In recent years, there is an increasing number of speakers of [[Chinese language]] as well.

===2011 census===

According to the 2011 census, main languages spoken in Vojvodina were:
*[[Serbian language|Serbian]]: 1,485,791 (76.91%)
*[[Hungarian language|Hungarian]]: 241,164 (12.48%)
*[[Slovak language|Slovak]]: 47,760 (2.47%)
*[[Romani language|Romani]]: 27,430 (1.42%)
*[[Romanian language|Romanian]]: 24,133 (1.25%)
*[[Croatian language|Croatian]]: 14,576 (0.75%)
*[[Pannonian Rusyn language|Rusyn]]: 11,154 (0.58%)

==Usage of minority languages==
[[Image:Novi Sad mayor office.jpg|thumb|150px|Plaque in front of Mayor's office written in four official languages used in the City of Novi Sad: ([[Serbian language|Serbian]], [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], and [[Pannonian Rusyn language|Rusyn]])]]
Besides [[Serbian language|Serbian]], which is the official language in the whole country, there are five regional languages in the official use by the provincial administration in Vojvodina: [[Hungarian language|Hungarian]], [[Romanian language|Romanian]], [[Slovak language|Slovak]], [[Pannonian Rusyn language|Rusyn]], and [[Croatian language|Croatian]]. The Serbian language is used in all municipality governments, while minority languages are used in selected municipality governments. The Serbian language with [[Cyrillic script]] is in official use in all 45 municipalities of Vojvodina, while Serbian [[Latin script]] is in official use in only 23 of 45 municipalities. The Hungarian language is in official use in 29 municipalities, Slovak in 12, Romanian in 9, Rusyn in 6, and Croatian and Czech in 1 municipality each (however, the Czech language is not official at provincial level).

[[Radio Television of Vojvodina]], the public broadcaster in the province, broadcasts programme in 10 languages: Serbian, Hungarian, Slovak, Rusyn, Romanian, Bunjevac, Ukrainian, Romani, Croatian, and Macedonian. Certain TV shows are also translated into [[Sign language]].

'''Lesbian feminism''' is a [[cultural movement]] and [[Critique|critical]] perspective, most influential in the 1970s and early 1980s (primarily in [[North America]] and [[Western Europe]]), that encourages women to direct their energies toward other women rather than men, and often advocates [[lesbian]]ism as the logical result of [[feminism]].&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Rich | first1= Adrienne | year = 1980 | title = [[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence]] | journal = Signs | volume = 5 | issue = | pages = 631–660 | doi=10.1086/493756| url = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some key thinkers and activists are [[Charlotte Bunch]], [[Rita Mae Brown]], [[Adrienne Rich]], [[Audre Lorde]], [[Marilyn Frye]], [[Mary Daly]], [[Sheila Jeffreys]], [[Barbara Smith]], [[Pat Parker]], [[Margaret Sloan-Hunter]], [[Cheryl Clarke]],  [[Gloria E. Anzaldúa|Gloria Anzaldua]], [[Cherríe Moraga|Cherrie Moraga]], and [[Monique Wittig]] (although the latter is more commonly associated with the emergence of [[queer theory]]).

Lesbian feminism came together in the early 1970s out of dissatisfaction with [[second-wave feminism]] and the [[gay liberation movement]].&lt;ref&gt;Faderman, Lillian: "Surpassing the Love of Men," p. 17. Quill/William Morrow, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[Ellen DuBois (1971). http://www.feministezine.com/feminist/modern/Old_and_New_Wave-Feminism.html Feminism Old Wave and New Wave]. The Feminist eZine. Accessed May 28, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the words of lesbian feminist [[Sheila Jeffreys]], "Lesbian feminism emerged as a result of two developments: lesbians within the WLM ([[Women's liberation movement|Women's Liberation Movement]]) began to create a new, distinctively feminist lesbian [[politics]], and lesbians in the GLF ([[Gay Liberation Front]]) left to join up with their sisters".&lt;ref name="Jeffreys19"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Sheila|title=Unpacking Queer Politics: A Lesbian Feminist Perspective|date=2003|edition=1st|page=19|publisher=[[Polity (publisher)|Polity]]|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0745628370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Judy Rebick]], a leading Canadian journalist and political activist for feminism, lesbians were and always have been at the heart of the [[women's movement]], while their issues were invisible in the same movement.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.international.activism.uts.edu.au/conferences/rebick/discussion.html Research on International Activism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323092851/http://www.international.activism.uts.edu.au/conferences/rebick/discussion.html |date=2012-03-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesbian feminism of color emerged as a response to lesbian feminism thought that failed to incorporate the issues of [[Social class|class]] and [[Race (human categorization)|race]] as sources of oppression along with [[heterosexuality]].

== Key ideas ==
Lesbian feminism, much like feminism, [[lesbian and gay studies]], and [[queer theory]], is characterized by the ideas of contestation and revision. At the same time, one of the key themes of lesbian feminism is the analysis of [[heterosexuality]] as an [[institution]].&lt;ref name=":1"/&gt; Lesbian feminist texts work to denaturalise heterosexuality and, based on this denaturalization, to explore heterosexuality's "roots" in institutions such as [[patriarchy]], [[capitalism]], and [[colonialism]]. Additionally, lesbian feminism advocates lesbianism as a rational result of [[Social alienation|alienation]] and dissatisfaction with these institutions.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Sheila Jeffreys defines lesbian feminism as having seven key themes:
* An emphasis on women's love for one another
* [[Separatism|Separatist]] organizations
* Community and ideas
* Idea that lesbianism is about ''choice'' and ''resistance''
* Idea that [[the personal is political]]
* A rejection of [[social hierarchy]]
* A critique of [[Androcentrism|male supremacy]] (which, according to Jeffreys, eroticises inequality)&lt;ref name="Jeffreys19" /&gt;

Lesbian feminist literary critic Bonnie Zimmerman frequently analyzes the language used by writers from within the movement, often drawing from autobiographical narratives and the use of personal testimony. According to Zimmerman, lesbian feminist texts tend to be expressly non-linear, poetic and even obscure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zimmerman |first=Bonnie |date=Autumn 1981 |title=What Has Never Been: An Overview of Lesbian Feminist Literary Criticism |url= |journal=Feminist Studies |volume=7 |issue=3 |pages=451 |doi=10.2307/3177760 |pmid= |access-date=|jstor=3177760 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesbian feminists of color argue for [[intersectionality]], in particular the crossings of [[gender]], [[sex]], class, and race, as an important component of lesbian feminist thought.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

=== Biology, choice and social constructionism ===
{{see also|Political lesbianism|Queer by choice}}

As outlined above, lesbian feminism typically situates [[lesbian]]ism as a form of resistance to "man-made" institutions. Cheryl Clarke writes in her essay ''New Notes on Lesbianism'' "I name myself "lesbian" because this culture oppresses, silences, and destroys lesbians, even lesbians who don't call themselves "lesbians." I name myself "lesbian" because I want to be visible to other black lesbians. I name myself "lesbian" because I do not subscribe to predatory/institutionalized heterosexuality".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Days of Good Looks: The Prose and Poetry of Cheryl Clarke |last=Cheryl |first=Clarke |publisher=Da Capo Press |year=2006 |isbn=0-7867-1675-4 |location= |pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to ''A Dictionary of Gender Studies'', some lesbians who believed themselves to be 'born that way' considered political lesbians or those who believe lesbianism is a choice based on the institutionalized heterosexuality were appropriating the term 'lesbian' and not experiencing or speaking out against the oppression that those women experience.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Dictionary of Gender Studies|last=Griffin|first=Gabriele|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2017|isbn=9780191834837|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Indeed, it could be argued that lesbian feminism pre-empted if not laid the groundwork for queer theory to posit sexuality as culturally specific.{{Original research inline|date=July 2018}}

=== Separatism ===
{{main|Separatist feminism}}{{see also|Queer nationalism}}

Lesbian separatism is a form of separatist feminism specific to lesbians. Separatism has been considered by lesbians as both a temporary strategy, and as a lifelong practice but mostly the latter.&lt;ref&gt;{http://feminist-reprise.org/docs/FF/feminism_first_english.htmC&lt;/ref&gt; In separatist feminism, lesbianism is posited as a key feminist [[strategy]] that enables [[women]] to invest their energies in other women, creating new space and [[dialogue]] about women's relationships, and typically, limits their dealings with men.&lt;ref&gt;Revolutionary Lesbians: "How to Stop Choking to Death Or: Separatism," 1971, in, "For Lesbians Only: A Separatist Anthology," ed. Hoagland, Sarah Lucia, and Julia Penelope. p. 22-24. Onlywomen Press, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesbian separatism became popular in the 1970s as some lesbians doubted whether [[mainstream]] society or even the [[Gay liberation|Gay rights]] movement had anything to offer them. In 1970, seven women (including [[Del Martin]]) confronted the North Conference of Homophile [meaning homosexual] Organizations about the relevance of the gay rights movement to the women within it. The delegates passed a resolution in favor of women's liberation, but Del Martin felt they had not done enough and wrote "If That's All There Is", an influential 1970 essay in which she decried gay rights organizations as sexist.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Blasius, Shane Phelan [https://books.google.com/books?id=B_tMFSkHzr8C&amp;pg=PA352 We are everywhere: a historical sourcebook in gay and lesbian politics], Routledge, 1997 {{ISBN|0-415-90859-0}} p. 352&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vern L. Bullough [https://books.google.com/books?id=A7x_VnES2esC&amp;pg=PA160 Before Stonewall: activists for gay and lesbian rights in historical context], Routledge, 2002 {{ISBN|1-56023-193-9}} p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; In the summer of 1971, a lesbian group calling themselves "[[The Furies Collective|The Furies]]" formed a commune open to lesbians only, where they put out a monthly newspaper. "The Furies" consisted of twelve women, aged eighteen to twenty-eight, all feminists, all lesbians, all white, with three children among them.&lt;ref name="google3"&gt;Dudley Clendinen, Adam Nagourney [https://books.google.com/books?id=6zRFBGTSgoUC&amp;pg=PA104 Out for Good: The Struggle to Build a Gay Rights Movement in America], Simon &amp; Schuster, 2001 {{ISBN|0-684-86743-5}}, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; They shared chores and clothes, lived together, held some of their money in common, and slept on mattresses on a common floor.&lt;ref name="google3"/&gt; They also started a school to teach women auto and home repair so they would not be dependent on men.&lt;ref name="google3"/&gt; The newspaper lasted from January 1972 to June 1973;&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Zimmerman [https://books.google.com/books?id=0EUoCrFolGcC&amp;pg=PA322 Lesbian histories and cultures: an encyclopedia] Garland Pub., 2000 {{ISBN|0-8153-1920-7}}, p. 322&lt;/ref&gt; the commune itself ended in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Penny A. Weiss, Marilyn Friedman [https://books.google.com/books?id=63J-U6N2THYC&amp;pg=PA131 Feminism and community], Temple University Press, 1995 {{ISBN|1-56639-277-2}} p. 131&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Charlotte Bunch]], an early member of "The Furies", viewed separatist feminism as a strategy, a "first step" period, or temporary withdrawal from mainstream activism to accomplish specific goals or enhance [[Personal development|personal growth]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Charlotte Bunch]] (1972). "Lesbians in Revolt: Male Supremacy Quakes and Quivers".&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Davis, Flora. Moving the Mountain: The Women's Movement in America since 1960, University of Illinois Press, 1999, {{ISBN|0-252-06782-7}}, p271&lt;/ref&gt; Other lesbians, such as [[Lambda Award]] winning author [[Elana Dykewomon]], have chosen separatism as a lifelong practice.

In addition to advocating withdrawal from working, personal or casual relationships with men, "The Furies" recommended that Lesbian Separatists relate "only (with) women who cut their ties to [[male privilege]]"&lt;ref name="Bunch 1972, pp.8-9"&gt;Bunch, Charlotte/The Furies Collective, "Lesbians in Revolt", in ''The Furies: Lesbian/Feminist Monthly'', vol. 1, January 1972, pp.8–9&lt;/ref&gt; and suggested that "as long as women still benefit from heterosexuality, receive its privileges and security, they will at some point have to betray their sisters, especially Lesbian sisters who do not receive those benefits".&lt;ref name="Bunch 1972, pp.8-9"/&gt;

This was part of a larger idea that Bunch articulated in ''Learning from Lesbian Separatism'', that "in a male-supremacist society, heterosexuality is a political institution" and the practice of separatism is a way to escape its domination.&lt;ref&gt;Bunch, Charlotte. (November 1976). ''Learning from Lesbian Separatism''. [[Ms. (magazine)|Ms.]].&lt;/ref&gt;

In her 1988 book, ''Lesbian Ethics: Towards a New Value'', lesbian philosopher [[Sarah Lucia Hoagland]] alludes to lesbian separatism's potential to encourage lesbians to develop healthy community ethics based on shared values. Hoagland articulates a distinction (originally noted by Lesbian Separatist author and anthologist, [[Julia Penelope]]) between a ''lesbian subculture'' and a ''lesbian community''; membership in the subculture being "defined in negative terms by an external, hostile culture", and membership in the community being based on "the values we believe we can enact here".&lt;ref&gt;Hoagland, Sarah Lucia. (1988). Lesbian Ethics: Towards a New Value. Institute for Lesbian Studies. Palo Alto, California.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bette Tallen believes that lesbian separatism, unlike some other [[separatist]] movements, is "not about the establishment of an [[independent state]], it is about the development of an autonomous [[self-identity]] and the creation of a strong solid lesbian community".&lt;ref&gt;Tallen, Bette S. ''Lesbian Separatism: A Historical and Comparative Perspective'', in ''For Lesbians Only: A Separatist Anthology'', [[Onlywomen Press]], 1988, {{ISBN|0-906500-28-1}}, p141&lt;/ref&gt;

Lesbian historian [[Lillian Faderman]] describes the separatist impulses of lesbian feminism which created culture and cultural artifacts as "giving love between women greater visibility" in broader culture.&lt;ref name="Faderman, Lillian p220"&gt;Faderman, Lillian. ''Odd Girls and Twilight Lovers'', Columbia University Press, {{ISBN|0-231-07488-3}}, p. 220&lt;/ref&gt; Faderman also believes that lesbian feminists who acted to create separatist institutions did so to "bring their ideals about integrity, nurturing the needy, self-determination and equality of labor and rewards into all aspects of institution-building and economics".&lt;ref name="Faderman, Lillian p220"/&gt;

The practice of Lesbian separatism sometimes incorporates concepts related to [[queer nationalism]] and [[political lesbianism]]. Some individuals who identify as Lesbian separatists are also associated with the practice of [[Dianic paganism]].&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.warren-wilson.edu/~religion/newifo/religions/paganism/index/goddess/essay.shtml Empowering the Goddess Within] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120212231957/http://www.warren-wilson.edu/~religion/newifo/religions/paganism/index/goddess/essay.shtml |date=2012-02-12 }}'', by Jessica Alton&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1754 Goddesses and Witches: Liberation and Countercultural Feminism] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141026140651/http://www.religion-online.org/showarticle.asp?title=1754 |date=2014-10-26 }}'', by Rosemary Ruether&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "womyn's land" has been used in America to describe communities of lesbian separatists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/02/01/fashion/01womyn.html | work=The New York Times | title=My Sister's Keeper | first=Sarah | last=Kershaw | date=2009-02-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
Elsewhere, lesbian feminists have situated female separatism as quite a mainstream thing and have explored the mythology surrounding it. [[Marilyn Frye]]'s (1978) essay ''Notes on Separatism and Power'' is one such example. She posits female separatism as a strategy practiced by all women, at some point, and present in many feminist projects (one might cite women's refuges, electoral quotas or women's studies programmes). She argues that it is only when women practice it, self-consciously ''as'' separation from men, that it is treated with controversy (or as she suggests [[hysteria]]). On the other hand, male separatism (one might cite gentleman's clubs, labour unions, sports teams, the military and, more arguably, decision-making positions in general) is seen as quite a normal, even expedient phenomenon.

Still, other lesbian feminists put forward a notion of "tactical separatism" from men, arguing for and investing in things like women's sanctuaries and [[consciousness-raising]] groups, but also exploring everyday practices to which women may temporarily retreat or practice solitude from [[men]] and [[masculinity]].

Margaret Sloan-Hunter compared lesbian separatism to black separatism. In her work ''Making Separatist Connections: The Issue is Woman Identification'' she stated "If Lesbian separatism fails it will be because women are so together that we will just exude woman identification wherever we go. But since sexism is much older than racism, it seems that we must for now embrace separatism, at least psychically, for health and consciousness sake. This is a revolution, not a public relations campaign, we must keep reminding ourselves".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.feminist-reprise.org/docs/Sloan-Hunter.htm|title=Making Separatist Connections|website=www.feminist-reprise.org|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some of the lesbian feminist groups, however, were skeptical of separatism. As such, a prominent black lesbian feminist group, the [[Combahee River Collective]], stated that separatism is not a viable political strategy for them.

=== The woman-identified woman ===
If the founding of the lesbian feminist movement could be pinpointed at a specific moment, it would probably be May 1970, when [[Radicalesbians]], an activist group of 20 lesbians led by lesbian novelist [[Rita Mae Brown]], took over the ''Congress to Unite Women'', a women's conference in [[New York City]]. Uninvited, they lined up on stage wearing matching T-shirts inscribed with the words "[[Lavender Menace]]", and demanded the microphone to read aloud to an audience of 400 their essay "[[The Woman-Identified Woman]]", which laid out the main precepts of their movement.&lt;ref&gt;Jay, Karla: "Tales of the Lavender Menace: A Memoir of Liberation," p. 142-144. Basic Books, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt; Later on, Adrienne Rich incorporated this concept in her essay "[[Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence]]", in which she unpacks the idea that patriarchy dictates women to be focused on men or to be "men-identified women. Becoming women-identified women, i.e. changing the focus of attention and energy from men to women, is a way to resist the patriarchal oppression".&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Contrary to some popular beliefs about "[[misandry|man-hating]] [[Butch and femme|butch]] [[Dyke (lesbian)|dykes]]", lesbian feminist theory does not support the concept of female masculinity. Proponents like Sheila Jeffreys (2003:13) have argued that "all forms of masculinity are problematic".

This is one of the principal areas in which lesbian feminism differs from queer theory, perhaps best summarized by [[Judith Halberstam]]'s quip that "If Sheila Jeffreys didn't exist, [[Camille Paglia]] would have had to invent her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2005/jul/02/gender.politicsphilosophyandsociety|title=The ugly side of beauty|author=Bindel, Julie|date=July 2, 2005|publisher=The Guardian, UK}}, Retrieved 2013-05-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

The overwhelming majority of the activists and scholars associated with lesbian feminist theory have been women; however, there are a few exceptions. For instance, political theorist [[Eugene Lewis]], whose critique of patriarchal society explores the parallels between the theatrical mockery of women in the works of [[C.S. Lewis]] (no relation) and underground [[male prostitution]] rings, describes himself as "a lesbian feminist in the ideological sense".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Lewis | first1 = Eugene | year = 1997 | title = Reflections on Patriarchy: A Comparison of the Gendered Worlds of the Sex Industry and the Chronicles of Narnia | url = | journal = Journal of Women in Culture and Society | volume = 21 | issue = 3| page = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Womyn's culture ===
"[[Womyn]]" along with "wimmin" and "womin" were terms created by alliances within the lesbian feminist movement to distinguish them from men and masculine (or "[[phallogocentric]]") language. The term "women" was seen as derivative of men and ultimately symbolized the prescriptive nature of women's oppression. A new vocabulary emerged more generally, sometimes referencing lost or unspoken [[matriarchal]] civilizations, [[Amazons|Amazonian warriors]], ancient – especially Greek – goddesses, sometimes parts of the female anatomy and often references to the natural world. It was frequently remarked that the movement had nothing to go on, no knowledge of its roots, nor histories of lesbianism to draw on. Hence the emphasis on consciousness-raising and carving out new (arguably) "[[gynocentrism|gynocentric]]" cultures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Newton|first=Esther|date=1984|title=The Mythic Mannish Lesbian: Radclyffe Hall and the New Woman|jstor=3173611|journal=Signs|doi=10.1086/494087|pmid=|volume=9|pages=557–575}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Lesbians and mainstream feminism ==
As a critical perspective, lesbian feminism is perhaps best defined in opposition to mainstream feminism and queer theory. It has certainly been argued that mainstream feminism has been guilty of homophobia in its failure to integrate sexuality as a fundamental category of gendered inquiry, and its treatment of lesbianism as a separate issue.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://bitchmedia.org/article/everything-about-feminism-you-wanted-to-know-but-were-afraid-to-ask|title=Everything You Always Wanted to Know About Feminism But Were Afraid to Ask {{!}} Bitch Media|website=Bitch Media|access-date=2016-03-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.colorado.edu/UCB/StudentAffairs/WomensResourceCenter/evokejournal/currentissue/submissions/words/nolan_bouchillon_difference.html|title=Evoke Journal|last=Bouchillon|first=Nolan|date=2007|website=University of Colorado|publisher=|access-date=March 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In this respect, [[Adrienne Rich]]'s (1980) classic text "[https://web.archive.org/web/20160213095421/http://people.terry.uga.edu/dawndba/4500compulsoryhet.htm Compulsory Heterosexuality and Lesbian Existence]" is instructive and one of the landmarks in lesbian feminism.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Influence within feminist organizations ===
==== National Organization for Women (USA) ====
Lesbians have been active in the mainstream American feminist movement. The first time lesbian concerns were introduced into the [[National Organization for Women|National Organization for Women (NOW)]] was in 1969, when [[Ivy Bottini]], an open lesbian who was then president of the New York chapter of NOW, held a public forum titled "Is Lesbianism a Feminist Issue?".&lt;ref name="bare_url_d"&gt;[[Barbara Love|Love, Barbara J.]] [https://books.google.com/books?id=kpNarH7t9CkC&amp;pg=PA51&amp;dq=1968+lesbian+ivy+bottini&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=7#v=onepage&amp;q=1968%20lesbian%20ivy%20bottini Feminists Who Changed America, 1963-1975]&lt;/ref&gt; However, NOW president [[Betty Friedan]] was against lesbian participation in the movement. In 1969 she referred to growing lesbian visibility as a "lavender menace" and fired openly-lesbian newsletter editor [[Rita Mae Brown]], and in 1970 she engineered the expulsion of lesbians, including Ivy Bottini, from NOW's New York chapter.&lt;ref&gt;Bonnie Zimmerman [https://books.google.com/books?id=0EUoCrFolGcC&amp;pg=PA134 Lesbian histories and cultures: an encyclopedia], Garland Pub., 2000 {{ISBN|0815319207}} p. 134&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vicki Lynn Eaklor [https://books.google.com/books?id=qJZdHuZ0aM0C&amp;pg=PA145 Queer America: a GLBT history of the 20th century], ABC-CLIO, 2008 {{ISBN|0313337497}} p. 145&lt;/ref&gt; In response, on the first evening when four hundred feminists were assembled in the auditorium at the 1970 Congress to Unite Women, a group of twenty women wearing T-shirts that read "Lavender Menace" came to the front of the room and faced the audience.&lt;ref name="google2"&gt;Flora Davis [https://books.google.com/books?id=ioM-8naFn60C&amp;pg=PA264 Moving the mountain: the women's movement in America since 1960], University of Illinois Press, 1999 {{ISBN|0-252-06782-7}} p. 264&lt;/ref&gt; One of the women then read the group's declaration ''The Woman-Identified Woman'', the first major lesbian feminist statement.&lt;ref name="google2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Cheshire Calhoun [https://books.google.com/books?id=7V73W75tGssC&amp;pg=PA27 Feminism, the Family, and the Politics of the Closet: Lesbian and Gay Displacement], Oxford University Press, 2003 {{ISBN|0-19-925766-3}} p. 27&lt;/ref&gt; The group, who later named themselves "Radicalesbians", were among the first to challenge the heterosexism of heterosexual feminists and to describe lesbian experience in positive terms.&lt;ref&gt;Carolyn Zerbe Enns [https://books.google.com/books?id=bIe7ZtOubc8C&amp;pg=PA105 Feminist theories and feminist psychotherapies: origins, themes, and diversity], Routledge, 2004 {{ISBN|078901808X}} p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; In 1971, NOW passed a resolution that proclaimed “a woman's right to her own person includes the right to define and express her own sexuality and to choose her own lifestyle," as well as a conference resolution stating that forcing lesbian mothers to stay in marriages or to live a secret existence in an effort to keep their children was unjust.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2"&gt;[http://now.org/resource/now-leading-the-fight/ Leading the Fight | National Organization for Women].

==== National Plan of Action of the 1977 National Women's Conference (USA) ====
In November 1977 the [[National Women's Conference]] issued a [http://www.lindagriffith.com/IWY%20PlanofAction.html National Plan of Action], which stated in part, "Congress, State, and local legislatures should enact legislation to eliminate discrimination on the basis of sexual and affectional preference in areas including, but not limited to, employment, housing, public accommodations, credit, public facilities, government funding, and the military. State legislatures should reform their penal codes or repeal State laws that restrict private sexual behavior between consenting adults. State legislatures should enact legislation that would prohibit consideration of sexual or affectional orientation as a factor in any judicial determination of child custody or visitation rights. Rather, child custody cases should be evaluated solely on the merits of which party is the better parent, without regard to that person's sexual and affectional orientation." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lindagriffith.com/IWY%20PlanofAction.html Plan of Action].

== Tensions with queer theory ==
The emergence of queer theory in the 1990s built upon certain principles of lesbian feminism, including the critique of compulsory heterosexuality, the understanding of gender as defined in part by heterosexuality, and the understanding of sexuality as institutional instead of personal. Despite this, queer theory is largely set in opposition to lesbian feminism. Whereas lesbian feminism is traditionally critical of [[BDSM]], [[Butch and femme|butch/femme identities and relationships]], [[transgender]]ism, [[transsexuality]], [[pornography]], and [[prostitution]], queer theory tends to embrace them. Queer theorists embrace [[Genderqueer|gender fluidity]] and subsequently have critiqued lesbian feminism as having an essentialist understanding of gender that runs counter to their stated aims. Lesbian feminists have critiqued queer theory as implicitly male-oriented and a recreation of the male-oriented Gay Liberation Front that lesbian feminists initially sought refuge from. Queer theorists have countered by pointing out that the majority of the most prominent queer theorists are feminists and many (including [[Judith Butler]], [[Judith Halberstam]], and [[Gayle Rubin]]) are lesbians.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jagose |first=Annamarie |date=1996 |title= Queer Theory: An Introduction |location=New York, NY |publisher=New York University Press}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Barry (2002) suggests that in choosing between these possible alignments (lesbian feminism and/or queer theory) one must answer whether it is gender or sexuality that is the more "fundamental in personal identity."{{citation needed|date=August 2018}}

=== Views on BDSM ===
Because of its focus on equality in sexual relationships, lesbian feminism has traditionally been opposed to any form of BDSM that involve perpetuation of gender stereotypes. This view was challenged in the late 1970s, most notably by the [[Samois]] group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Encyclopedia of Women's Health|author1=Sana Loue|author2=Martha Sajatovic|author3=Keith B. Armitage|publisher=Springer|year=2004|isbn=0-306-48073-5|page=363}}[https://books.google.com/books?id=LbHWgd-mDbsC&amp;pg=PA363&amp;lpg=PA363&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=9#v=onepage]&lt;/ref&gt; Samois was a San Francisco-based feminist organization focused on BDSM. Samois members felt strongly that their way of practicing BDSM was entirely compatible with feminism, and held that the kind of feminist sexuality advocated by [[Women Against Violence in Pornography and Media]] was conservative and puritanical.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leatherarchives.org/resources/issue21.pdf |publisher=Leather Times |author=Gayle Rubin |title=Samois |page=3 |date=Spring 2004 |accessdate=2009-08-06 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090327070824/http://www.leatherarchives.org/resources/issue21.pdf |archivedate=March 27, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, many black lesbian feminists have spoken out against the practice of BDSM as racist. According to scholars [[Darlene Pagano]], [[Karen Sims]], and [[Rose Mason]], sadomasochism, in particular, is a practice that often lacks sensitivity to the black female experience as it can be historically linked to similar forms of sexual violence and dominance enacted against black female slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rich|first1=B.

=== Views on bisexuality ===
[[Bisexuality]] is rejected by some lesbian feminists as being a reactionary and anti-feminist [[Backlash (sociology)|backlash]] to lesbian feminism.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Wilkinson |first1=Sue |authorlink1= |last2= |first2= |authorlink2= |editor1-first=Lynne |editor1-last=Harne |editor1-link= |others=Elaine Miller |title=All the Rage: Reasserting Radical Lesbian Feminism |trans-title=|url= |type= |edition= |series= |volume= |date= |year= 1996|month= |origyear= |publisher= [[Teachers College, Columbia University|Teacher's College Press]]|location= New York City|isbn= 0-807-76285-7 |oclc= 35202923|doi= |id= |page= |pages=75–89 |at= |trans-chapter=|chapter=Bisexuality as Backlash |chapterurl= |quote= |ref= |bibcode= |laysummary= |laydate= |author-mask= |display-authors= |postscript= |lastauthoramp=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A bisexual woman filed a lawsuit against the lesbian feminist magazine ''[[Common Lives/Lesbian Lives]]'', alleging discrimination against bisexuals when her submission was not published.&lt;ref name="sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu"&gt;[http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/iwa/findingaids/html/CommonlIves.html Common Lives/Lesbian Lives Records, Iowa Women's Archives, University of Iowa Libraries, Iowa City, Iowa] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150821003341/http://sdrc.lib.uiowa.edu/iwa/findingaids/html/CommonlIves.html |date=August 21, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A number of women who were at one time involved in lesbian feminist activism  [[Coming out|came out]] as bisexual after realizing their attractions to men. A widely studied example of lesbian-bisexual conflict within feminism was the Northampton Pride March during the years between 1989 and 1993, where many feminists involved debated over whether bisexuals should be included and whether or not bisexuality was compatible with feminism. Common lesbian feminist critiques leveled at bisexuality were that bisexuality was [[Antifeminism|anti-feminist]], that bisexuality was a form of [[false consciousness]], and that bisexual women who pursue relationships with men were "deluded and desperate." However, tensions between bisexual feminists and lesbian feminists have eased since the 1990s, as bisexual women have become more accepted within the feminist community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= Routledge International Encyclopedia of Queer Culture|last= Gerstner|first= David A.|year= 2006|publisher= [[Routledge]]|location= United Kingdom|isbn= 978-0-415-30651-5|page= |pages= 82–3|accessdate=October 3, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=XS_SnVPixE8C&amp;pg=PA82&amp;lpg=PA82&amp;dq=%22bisexual+feminism%22#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nevertheless, some lesbian feminists such as [[Julie Bindel]] are still critical of bisexuality. Bindel has described female bisexuality as a "fashionable trend" being promoted due to "sexual [[hedonism]]" and questioned whether bisexuality even exists.&lt;ref name="Bindel"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/julie-bindel/where-is-the-politics-in-_b_1589435.html |title=Where's the Politics in Sex? |publisher=''[[The Huffington Post]]'' |accessdate=2012-10-03 |first=Julie |last=Bindel |date=June 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She has also made [[tongue-in-cheek]] comparisons of bisexuals to [[Animal fancy|cat fanciers]] and [[Satanism|devil worshippers]].&lt;ref name="guardian.co.uk"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/2008/nov/08/lesbianism |title=It's not me.

Lesbian feminist Sheila Jeffreys writes in ''The Lesbian Heresy'' (1993) that while many feminists are comfortable working alongside gay men, they are uncomfortable interacting with bisexual men. Jeffreys states that while gay men are unlikely to [[Sexual harassment|sexually harass]] women, bisexual men are just as likely to be troublesome to women as heterosexual men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= The Lesbian Heresy|last= Jeffreys|first= Sheila|year= 1993|publisher= Spinifex Press Pty Ltf|location= [[Melbourne]], [[Australia]] |isbn= 1-875559-17-5|page= 124|pages= |accessdate=October 4, 2012 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0FFWxDu9gn0C&amp;pg=PA124&amp;lpg=PA124&amp;dq=feminism+%22bisexual+men%22#v=onepage}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contrast, ''[[Bi Any Other Name]]'' (1991), an anthology edited by [[Loraine Hutchins]] and [[Lani Ka'ahumanu]] considered one of the seminal books in the history of the modern bisexual rights movement, contains (among other things) the piece, "Bisexuality: The Best Thing That Ever Happened to Lesbian Feminism?", by Beth Elliot.&lt;ref name="lanikaahumanu1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lanikaahumanu.com/bianyothername.shtml|title=b i · a n y · o t h e r · n a m e|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Views on transgender people ===
Though lesbian feminists views vary, there is a specific lesbian feminist canon which rejects [[transgenderism (social movement)|transgenderism]], [[transsexualism|transsexuals]] and [[transvestism|transvestites]], positing trans people as, at best, gender dupes or functions of a discourse on mutilation; or at worst, shoring up support for traditional and violent gender norms. This is a position marked by intense controversy. Sheila Jeffreys summarized the arguments on this topic in ''Unpacking Queer Politics'' (2003).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Jeffreys|first1=Sheila|title=Unpacking Queer Politics: A Lesbian Feminist Perspective|date=2003|edition=1st|publisher=[[Polity (publisher)|Polity]]|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=978-0745628370}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1979, lesbian feminist [[Janice Raymond]] published ''[[The Transsexual Empire: The Making of the She-Male]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://worldcat.org/isbn/0807762725 |title=book |publisher=Worldcat.org |date= |accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Controversial even today, it looked at the role of [[transsexualism]] – particularly psychological and [[Surgery|surgical]] approaches to it – in reinforcing traditional gender stereotypes, the ways in which the medical-psychiatric complex is medicalizing “gender identity”, and the social and political context that has been instrumental in making transsexual treatment and surgery a normal and therapeutic medicine.

Raymond maintains that transsexualism is based on the "patriarchal myths" of "male mothering," and "making of woman according to man's image." She claims this is done in order "to colonize [[feminist]] identification, culture, politics and [[human sexuality|sexuality]]," adding: "All transsexuals [[rape]] women's bodies by reducing the real female form to an artifact, appropriating this body for themselves .... Transsexuals merely cut off the most obvious means of invading women, so that they seem non-invasive."&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Janice. (1994). ''The Transsexual Empire'', p. 104&lt;/ref&gt;

These views on transsexuality have been criticized by many in the [[LGBT]] and feminist communities as [[transphobic]] and constituting [[hate speech]] against transsexual men and women.&lt;ref name="rose2004"&gt;Rose, Katrina C. (2004) "The Man Who Would be Janice Raymond."

In her book, Janice Raymond includes sections on [[Sandy Stone (artist)|Sandy Stone]], a trans woman who had worked as a sound engineer for [[Olivia Records]], and Christy Barsky, accusing both of creating divisiveness in women's spaces.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond, Janice. (1994).

Lesbian feminism is sometimes associated with opposition to [[sex reassignment surgery]];&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=|title=Mistaken Identity|last=Bindel|first=Julie|date=May 23, 2007|work=|access-date=|via=The Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt; some lesbian feminist analyses see sex reassignment surgery as a form of violence akin to BDSM.&lt;ref&gt;Wayne, Tiffany K., and Lois W.

== Lesbian of color feminism ==
Feminism among lesbians of [[Person of color|color]] emerged as a response to the texts produced by [[White people|white]] lesbian feminist authors in the late 1970s. Typically, lesbian feminism at the time failed to recognize issues related to intersectionality between race, gender, and class.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|editor1-last=Moraga |editor1-first=Cherríe |editor2-last=Anzaldúa |editor2-first=Gloria E.|title =This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color|publisher = Kitchen Table/Women of Color Press|year = 1983|isbn = 978-0913175033|location = |pages = 98–101}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from this, lesbian feminists of color addressed the relationship between feminism as a movement and "ideology of cultural nationalism or racial pride", as well as the differences found in the prevalent texts.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Among the most influential lesbian feminists of color are [[Audre Lorde]], [[Gloria E.

Black lesbian feminism emerged as a venue to address the issue of racism in the mainstream feminist movement, which was described as white, middle-class, and predominantly heterosexual. According to a 1979 statement by Barbara Smith, "the reason racism is a feminist issue is easily explained by the inherent definition of feminism", which is "the political theory and practice to free all women: women of color, working-class women, poor women, physically challenged women, lesbians, old women, as well as white economically privileged heterosexual women." Later, in 1984, she extended her views on black lesbian feminism mission to "a movement committed to fighting sexual, racial, economic and heterosexist oppression, not to mention one which opposes imperialism, anti-Semitism, the oppressions visited upon the physically disabled, the old and the young, at the same time that it challenges militarism and imminent nuclear destruction is the very opposite of narrow.” &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://isreview.org/issue/91/black-feminism-and-intersectionality|title=Black feminism and intersectionality {{!}} International Socialist Review|website=isreview.org|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most prominent black lesbian feminists were writers rather than scholars and expressed their position in literary ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://blackfeminism.library.ucsb.edu/introduction.html|title=Black American Feminisms Bibliography: Introduction|last=Harlow|first=Gwen|website=blackfeminism.library.ucsb.edu|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Allida Mae Black states that unlike black feminism, in 1977 the position of black lesbian feminism was not as clear as the position of black feminism and was "an allusion in the text."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J8ZaIoiRW4YC|title=Modern American Queer History|last=Black|first=Allida Mae|date=2001-01-01|publisher=Temple University Press|isbn=9781566398725|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from this, the position of black lesbian feminists was expressed in their interviews and public speeches. As such, in a 1980 interview published in [[The American Poetry Review|American Poetry Review]], Audre Lorde stated that a "true feminist deals out of a lesbian consciousness whether or not she ever sleeps with women", as well as that all black women, whether they admit it or not, are lesbians because they are "raised in the remnants of a basically matriarchal society" and are still oppressed by patriarchy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.english.illinois.edu/maps/poets/g_l/lorde/feminist.htm|title=Audre Lorde on Being a Black Lesbian Feminist|website=www.english.illinois.edu|access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pat Parker's work reflected the oppression she suffered and observed in lives of other women. In her poem ''Have you Ever Tried to Hide'', Parker calls out racism in the white feminist movement. In her multiple works, including the poem "Womanslaughter", she drew attention to the violence Black women experience in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Movement in Black|last=Parker|first=Pat|publisher=Firebrand Books|year=1999|isbn=1563411083|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among others, Parker defended the idea of complex identities and stated that, for her, revolution will happen when all elements of her identity "can come along."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://elixher.com/heritage-pat-parker/|title=HERitage: Pat Parker|website=ELIXHER|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Combahee River Collective ====
The [[Combahee River Collective]] is a Boston-based black feminist group that was formed as a radical alternative to the [[National Black Feminist Organization|National Black Feminist Organization (NBFO)]] founded by Margaret Sloan-Hunter in 1973.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Let Nobody Turn Us Around: Voices of Resistance, Reform, and Renewal |editor1-last=Marable |editor1-first=Manning |editor2-last=Mullings |editor2-first=Leith |publisher=Rowman and Littlefield |year=2000 |isbn=0-8476-8346-X |location= |page=524}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the organization's members, NBFO lacked attention to the issues of sexuality and economic oppression. The Collective united the women that were dissatisfied with racism in white feminist movement and sexism in civil rights movement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://outhistory.org/exhibits/show/lesbians-20th-century/lesbian-feminism |title=Lesbian Feminism, 1960s and 1970s · Lesbians in the Twentieth Century, 1900-1999 |website=outhistory.org |access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the organization alludes to the [[Underground Railroad]] Combahee River Raid that happened in 1863 under [[Harriet Tubman]]'s leadership and freed 750 slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Theorizing Feminism: Parallel Trends in the Humanities and Social Sciences |editor1-last=Herrmann |editor1-first=Anne C. |editor2-last=Stewart |editor2-first=Abigail J. |publisher=Westview Press |year=2001 |isbn=0-8133-6788-3 |location= |page=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Combahee River Collective issued a statement in 1977 that described the organization's vision as being opposed to all forms of oppression — including sexuality, gender identity, class, disability, and age oppression (later incorporated in the concept of intersectionality) that shaped the conditions on black women's lives.

In its "Statement", the Combahee River Collective defined itself as a left-wing organization leaning towards socialism and anti-imperialism. The organization also claimed that unlike some white feminist groups or NBFO, the Collective members are in "solidarity with progressive Black men and do not advocate the fractionalization" and emphasizing that "the stance of Lesbian separatism ... is not a viable political analysis or strategy."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://circuitous.org/scraps/combahee.html |title=The Combahee River Collective Statement|website=circuitous.org |access-date=2016-03-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other organizations under the stance of black lesbian feminism include [[Salsa Soul Sisters|Salsa Souls Sisters]], formed in 1974 in New York City and considered to be the oldest black besbian feminist organization; and Sapphire Sapphos, formed in 1979 in Washington, DC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=_rvcAwAAQBAJ |title=A Queer Capital: A History of Gay Life in Washington |last=Beemyn |first=Genny |date=2014-06-20 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=978-1-317-81938-7 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=9JguzYBtZT0C |title=Aberrations in Black: Toward a Queer of Color Critique |last=Ferguson |first=Roderick A. |date=2004-01-01 |publisher=University of Minnesota Press |isbn=978-0-8166-4129-1 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Visual art works ====
The more recent art form used to express black lesbian feminist ideas is film. In particular, [[Aishah Shahidah Simmons]], an award-winning black lesbian feminist, made ''NO! The Rape Documentary'' (2006), a [[Documentary film|documentary]] that explores how rape is used as a weapon of homophobia. For Simmons, a sexual assault survivor herself, the film was also an exploration of how rape impacted her Black feminist lesbian journey.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thefeministwire.com/2012/02/introducing-aishah-shahidah-simmons/|title=Introducing: Aishah Shahidah Simmons - The Feminist Wire|website=The Feminist Wire|language=en-US|access-date=2016-03-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://notherapedocumentary.org/aishah-shahidah-simmons-bio|title=NO!

=== Chicana lesbian feminism ===
Chicana lesbian feminism emerged from the [[Chicana feminism]] movement in the late 1970s and early 1980s. During this time, Chicana feminism began to form as a “social movement aimed to improve the position of Chicanas in American society.”&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Garcia|first=Alma M.|title=The Development of Chicana Feminist Discourse 1970-1980|journal=Gender and Society|date=1989|volume=3|pages=217–238|doi=10.1177/089124389003002004|pmid=|url=http://gas.sagepub.com/content/3/2/217.full.pdf+html}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Chicanas separated from the [[Chicano movement]] began drawing their own political agendas, and started to question their traditional female roles.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt; Specifically, Chicana feminists (see also [[Chicana literature]]) started addressing the forces that affected them as women of color and fighting for social equality.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

In ''With Her Machete in Her Hand: Reading Chicana Lesbians'' (2009), the first monograph dedicated to the work of Chicana lesbians, Catriona Rueda Esquibel stated "Chicana lesbians are central to understanding Chicana/o communities, theories, and feminisms."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=With Her Machete in Her Hand: Reading Chicana Lesbians|date=2009|publisher=University of Texas Press|last1=Esquibel|first1=Catriona Rueda}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to black lesbian feminists, Chicana lesbian feminists use literature as a way of naming themselves, expressing their ideas, and reclaiming their experiences flagged with a number of accusations.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They are accused of being lesbians, of betraying society by denying men of their reproductive role, and of betraying their Chicana identity by adhering to feminist and lesbian ideologies, both things considered by Chicano culture as "white" notions.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{cite journal|date=2010|title=Lesbianismo y literatura chicana: la construcción de una identidad|url=http://estudiosamericanos.revistas.csic.es/index.php/estudiosamericanos/article/view/331|journal=Anuario de Estudios Americanos|volume=67|issue=1|pages=77–105|last1=Toda Iglesia|first1=Maria Angeles|doi=10.3989/aea.2010.v67.i1.331}}&lt;/ref&gt; The key Chicana lesbian feminist thinkers include [[Cherrie Moraga]], [[Gloria Anzaldúa]], Lidia Tirado White, [[Alicia Gaspar de Alba]], Emma Pérez, Carla Trujillo, [[Monica Palacios]], [[Ana Castillo]], Natashia López, and [[Norma Alarcon]].

In the feminist [[anthology]], ''[[This Bridge Called My Back|This Bridge Called My Back: Writings by Radical Women of Color]]'', Moraga and Anzaldúa describe the Chicana lesbian feminist mission as follows: "we attempt to bridge the contradictions in our experience. We are the colored in a white feminist movement. We are the feminists among the people of our culture. We are often the lesbians among the straight. We do this bridging by naming ourselves and by telling our stories in our own words."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=This Bridge Called my Back|publisher=Kitchen Table/Women of Color Press|year=1983|isbn=978-0913175033|location=|pages=98–101}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the foundational concepts of Chicana lesbian feminist movement is “theory in the flesh”, which is "flesh and blood experiences of the woman of color."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Specifically, as described by Moraga and Anzaldúa, "a theory in flesh means one where the typical realities of our lives —our skin color, the land or concrete we grew up on, our sexual belongings—all fuse to create a political born out of necessity."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In Moraga's article ''La Güera,'' she continues making reference to the theory in the flesh: "it wasn't until I acknowledged and confronted my own lesbianism in the flesh, that my heartfelt identification with and empathy for my mother's oppression —due to being poor, uneducated, Chicana— was realized."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Furthermore, this theory incorporates the ideas of finding strength in and celebrating each other's difference as well as reinterpreting the history by “shaping new myths”,&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; and lays in a process of naming themselves but also naming the enemies within oneself to break down paradigms. As Moraga explains in her prose ''Loving in the War Years: Lo que nunca paso por sus labios'': "in this country, lesbianism is a poverty — as is being brown, as is being a woman, as is being just plain poor. The danger lies in ranking the oppressions. The danger lies in failing to acknowledge the specificity of the oppression. The danger lies in attempting to deal with oppression purely from a theoretical base. Without an emotional, heartfelt grappling with the source of our own oppression, without naming the enemy within ourselves and outside of us, no authentic, non-hierarchical connection among oppressed groups can take place."&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

==== Genres and main themes ====
Chicana lesbian feminists challenge traditional forms of knowledge production, and introduce new ways of knowledge creation through new forms of writing. Many Chicana lesbian feminists use what [[Teresa de Lauretis]] named “fiction/theory”, “a formally experimental, critical and lyrical, autobiographical and theoretically conscious, practice of writing-in-the-feminine that crosses genre boundaries (poetry and prose, verbal and visual modes, narrative and cultural criticism), and instates new correlations between signs and meanings.”&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; They combine genres such as autobiography, poetry, theory, personal diaries or imaginary interviews. At the same time, Chicana lesbian feminists today navigate and struggle across a variety of discursive contexts (as activist, academics, feminists, and artists).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Phenomenology of Chicana experience and identity: Communication and transformation in praxis|date=2000|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|last1=Martinez|first1=J, M}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Through their literature and art, Chicana lesbian feminists explore their [[Lived body|body lived experiences]], a fundamental aspect in the construction of lesbian identity.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; They reclaim the idea of the real body and the physical aspect of it. Chicana lesbian feminists bring into the discussion the conflicts with the concept of ''la familia'', the new ''familias'' they create, and their right to choose their own sexuality. Martha Barrera writes “we are just as valid a ''familia'' as we would be if she were a brown man who I married in the Catholic Church.”&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; At the same time they try to find reconciliation with their ''familia''. Juanita M. Sánchez writes “my father wanted me to go to work my grandmother wanted me to speak more Spanish she couldn't speak English i wanted to make a living selling popsicles on my 1948 cushman scooter nothing turned out like they wanted but my mother did say, “if you want to be with a woman, que le hace, as long as you're happy”.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Chicana lesbian feminists confront their lesbian identity with their Chicano identity.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; This constitutes a central aspect of Chicana lesbian literature. Renée M. Martinez expresses her impossibility to reconcile the two identities: "being a Chicana and a lesbian, my parents' daughter and a lesbian, alive and a lesbian", lesbianism “would sever me from everything that counted in my life: homosexuality, the ultimate betrayal of my Mexican heritage, was only for white people.”&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Anzaldúa|editor1-first=Gloria E.|editor2-last=Keating|editor2-first=Analouise|title=This Bridge We Call Home: Radical Visions For Transformation|date=2002|chapter=Del puente al arco iris: transformando de guerrera a mujer de la paz—From Bridge to Rainbow: Transforming from Warrior to Woman of Peace, by Renee M. Martinez|pages=42–50|publisher=Routledge|isbn=0-415-93681-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Moraga writes how “the woman who defies her role ... is purported to be a “traitor to her race” by contributing to the “genocide” of her people ... In short, even if the defiant woman is not a lesbian, she is purported to be one; for, like the lesbian in the Chicano imagination, she is una Malinchista. Like the Malinche of Mexican history, she is corrupted by foreign influences which threaten to destroy her people. […] Lesbianism can be construed by the race then as the Chicana being used by the white man, even if the man never lays a hand on her. The choice is never seen as her own. Homosexuality is his disease with which he sinisterly infects Third World people, men and women alike.”&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

'''Ma'anyan''' (colonial spelling '''Maanjan''' or '''Meanjan'''), '''Dayak Maanyak''' or '''Eastern Barito Dayak''' people are a sub-ethnic group of the [[Dayak people]] indigenous to [[Borneo]]. They are also considered as part of the east Barito [[Dusun people (Barito)|Dusun group]] with the name '''Dusun Ma'anyan'''. According to J. Mallinckrodt (1927), the Dusun people group is part of the [[Ot Danum people]] cluster, although later that theory was disproved by A. B. Hudson (1967), who argues that the Ma'anyan people are a branch of the Barito family. The Ma'anyan people who are often referred to as [[Dayak people]] are also referred to as Dayak Ma'anyan. The Dayak Ma'anyan people inhabit the east side of [[Central Kalimantan]], especially in the [[East Barito Regency]] and parts of [[South Barito Regency]] which are grouped as Ma'anyan I. The Dayak Ma'anyan people also inhabit the northern parts of [[South Kalimantan]], especially in [[Tabalong Regency]] which refers to the Dayak Warukin people. The [[Dayak Balangan people]] or Dusun Balangan people which are found in the [[Balangan Regency]] and the [[Dayak Samihim people]] that are found in the [[Kotabaru Regency]] are grouped together with the Dayak Ma'anyan people group. The Dayak Ma'anyan people in South Kalimantan are grouped as Ma'anyan II.

Administratively, the Ma'anyan people have just recently appeared in the 2000 census and made up 2.8% of the Central Kalimantan population; previously the Ma'anyan people were grouped together with the Dayak people in the 1930 census.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Riwanto Tirtosudarmo|title=Mencari Indonesia: Demografi-Politik Pasca-Soeharto|year=2007|publisher=Yayasan Obor Indonesia|isbn=979-799-083-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The uniqueness of the Dusun Ma'anyan people among others are agriculture, elaborate funeral ceremonies, and having shaman to treat their disease.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Susanto, A. Budi|title=Politik Dan Postkolonialitas Di Indonesia|year=2003|publisher=Kanisius|isbn=978-979-210-850-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Rumah Betang Muara Bagok.jpg|thumb|right|''Rumah Betang'', a traditional Ma'anyan house in Muara Bagok, [[East Barito Regency]], [[Central Kalimantan]].]]
It is said that the Ma'anyan people arrived and settled on [[Madagascar]] island in 945 to 946 AD, sailing through the [[Indian Ocean]] on 1,000 leeboard sailboats.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Roland Oliver &amp; Brian M. Fagan|title=Africa In The Iron Age: c.500 BC-1400 AD|year=1975|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=0-5210-9900-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Based on historical facts, every stone relief in [[Borobudur]] tells of the [[Malay archipelago]] conditions during the peak of [[Buddhism]] period.{{clarify|date=June 2015}}{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} The [[Srivijayan]], [[Nan Sarunai]] and [[Majapahit]] kingdom had used the leeboard sailboats throughout its history. It is known that the [[Srivijaya]] kingdom did expand its empire covering [[West Java]], part of [[Central Java]] and the desperate Empu Sendok from [[Medang Kingdom]] which was about to reach [[East Java]] in 929 to 947 AD. Therefore, it is possible that scholars and artisans of that time period recorded the events of the Ma'anyan people evacuating in large numbers on leeboard sailboats in 945 to 946 AD on the stone reliefs of [[Borobudur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sanusi Pane|title=Sedjarah Indonesia, Volumes 1-2|year=1965|publisher=Balai Pustaka|pages=58–59}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the oral literature of the Ma'anyan people, after the Nan Sarunai kingdom was attacked by the [[Majapahit kingdom]], the Ma'anyan people broke up into several sub-group. Among the sub-groups, they are:-
* Ma'anyan Paku
* Ma'anyan Paju Epat/Ampat or Ma'anyan Siong
* Ma'anyan Dayu Lasi Muda
* Ma'anyan Paju Sapuluh of Kampung Sapuluh (had [[Banjar people|Banjarese]] influence)
* Ma'anyan Banua Lima or Paju Dime (had [[Banjar people|Banjarese]] influence)
** Ma'anyan Warukin (had [[Banjar people|Banjarese]] influence)
** Ma'anyan Jangkung (extinct and had [[Banjar people|Banjarese]] influence)

According to the Ma'anyan people, before they had begun occupying the current regions, they came from the downstream of [[South Kalimantan]]. Although today the [[East Barito Regency]] is not part of the [[South Kalimantan]] province, that region in the past was the last region to be a part of the [[Banjar sultanate]] before it was annexed to the [[Dutch Indies]] in 1860. It was a region of the [[Banjar sultanate]] that had shrunk and was land-locked as it was surrounded by other [[Dutch Indies]] territories.

==Ma'anyan people in Tabalong Regency and Balangan Regency in South Kalimantan==
[[File:Dayak Maanyan.png|thumb|upright|right|Ma'anyan people in a fruit market in Telang, 1963.]]
The Dayak Ma'anyan Warukin people whom are often referred as Dayak Warukin people are the sub-ethnic of the Ma'anyan people group living in villages such as Warukin, Haus and its surrounding in [[Tabalong Regency]], [[South Kalimantan]].&lt;ref&gt;http://melayuonline.com/ind/culture/dig/2710/kematian-dalam-pengetahuan-orang-dayak-maanyan-di-kalimantan-tengah&lt;/ref&gt; The settlements of the Dayak Warukin are found in regions where its surroundings are [[Banjar people|Banjarese]] settlements. The Dayak Warukin in Warukin village in [[Tanta District]], [[Tabalong Regency]] are part of the Ma'anyan Banua Lima people. The Ma'anyan Banua Lima people are a sub-ethnic of the Ma'anyan people found in Banua Lima, [[East Barito Regency]]. The original name of the people was Ma'anyan Paju Lima. The word "Banua" (literally means, continent) came from the [[Banjar language]]. The funeral ceremony of the Dayak Warukin people according to the [[Kaharingan]] religion is called ''mambatur'', or ''marabia'' for the Ma'anyan Banua Lima people.

The similarities of the Ma'anyan Warukin language with the [[Banjar language]] of Kuala Lupak are about 50%. While the similarities of the Ma'anyan Warukin language with the [[Banjar language]] of Asam-Asam village are about 57%.

There are four regions of [[Dayak people|Dayak]] culture in [[Tabalong Regency]], where one of its region is of Dayak Ma'anyan culture, namely:-
* Cultural region of Dayak Ma'anyan in Warukin village.
* Cultural region of Dayak Deyah of Kampung Sapuluh, which covers ten villages in Upau, Haruai and Bintang Ara districts.
* Cultural region of Dayak Deyah of Muara Uya and Jaro.
* Cultural region of [[Lawangan people|Dayak Lawangan]] of Binjai village.

Outside of the four [[Dayak people|Dayak]] cultural regions in [[Tabalong Regency]], there are also [[Banjar people]] who form as the majority of the [[Tabalong Regency]] population and these [[Banjar people]] are not bound by [[Dayak people|Dayak]] customary laws.

They speak  [[Moru language|Moru]], a [[Central Sudanic languages|Central Sudanic language]]. Many members of this ethnicity are [[Christian]]s, most being members of the Episcopal Church of the Sudan (ECS).&lt;ref&gt;LAWIRI, E.B. (1987)	The Growth of the Church in Moru Country.  Moru Literacy Project, Mundri, Sudan.  He set the Christian foundation through his work in Lui.&lt;/ref&gt; The Pioneer missionary in the area was Dr [[Kenneth Grant Fraser]] of the [[Church Missionary Society]] (CMS).&lt;ref&gt;Fraser, E.

==History==
The clearest communal historical narratives are of attacks by the [[Azande]], particularly those that drove them onto a hill near [[Lui, South Sudan|Lui]], raids by slavers from the North.  It was loosely part of the Ottoman-Egyptian province of [[Equatoria]], administered by [[Sir Samuel Baker]] and then [[Charles George Gordon]] and finally [[Emin Pasha]].  The Moru area was then part of the [[Lado Enclave]], in the far north east of the [[Congo Free State]], later [[Belgian Congo]] from 1894 to 1910.&lt;ref&gt;Stenger, S.J. (1969) "The Congo Free State and the Belgian Congo before 1910", in Colonialism in Africa, 1870-1960, vol. 1, (ed. Gavin, L.H. &amp; Duignan, P.) Cambridge University Press: Cambridge.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Men wounded by lions, Lui 1923.jpg|thumb|Patients at Lui hospital in 1923, having been wounded by lions.]]Dr [[Kenneth Grant Fraser]], a physician and missionary for the Gordon Memorial Sudan Mission (GMSM) of the [[Church Mission Society|Church Missionary Society]] (CMS) of England, and his wife Eileen began working in South Sudan in 1920 to improve access to health care, establish churches, and improve education. Fraser organized the establishment of a hospital at Lui and developed a program that trained and equipped medical workers to provide medical care under his direction at the hospital. Leper colonies were created under his direction. He trained teachers and evangelists to serve schools and churches that were established in Moruland along main roads. The buildings also operated as dispensaries. The benefits have included a good quality of education for the Moru people and reform of some harmful indigenous practices and customs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | author=James Lomole Simeon, Esq., Chancellor of the Diocese of Khartoum, Sudan |year=2003 | url=http://www.dacb.org/stories/sudan/fraser_kenneth.html | title=Fraser, Kenneth, 1877 to 1935, Episcopal, Sudan | publisher=Dictionary of African Christian Biography | accessdate=March 18, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
The Moru, who belong to the ethnic group which includes the [[Madi people|Madi]], [[Lugbara people|Lugbara]], [[Avukaya]] and [[Logo]] of [[Uganda]] and [[Democratic Republic of Congo]], live in the southern part of Mundri County, [[Western Equatoria]], South Sudan.  Mundri County is located in Central Western part of Equatoria Region in [[Western Equatoria]] Province.  It is between 4°N and 6°N of Equator and 29°E and 31°E. There are five main divisions of the Moru, namely: Miza; Ägyi; Moroändri; Kediro and 'Bari'ba, who each live in a distinct area and have their own dialectical differences.&lt;ref&gt;TUCKER, A.N. (1940) The Eastern Sudanic Languages.  OUP&lt;/ref&gt;  Other partial divisions can also be recognised.

The northern part of [[Mundri County]] is inhabited by the [[Jur people|Jur]] cluster, which includes the Beli, Sopi, Mödö, Nyamusa, Wira, Biti and [[Morokodo]].  Although they are often erroneously classified as Moru they form a distinct language group, more closely related to the [[Bongo people (South Sudan)|Bongo]] and [[Baka people (Congo and South Sudan)|Baka]].  The Moru have received the most attention in the past and Moru Miza was the vernacular used in education and the church throughout the district.

Settlement is in extended family groups surrounded by their gardens.  These families are linked together into clans under headmen and sub-chiefs, but there are few physical concentrations of villages.  The term village is generally used to describe the people who relate to one centre.

==Agriculture==
[[File:Hoeing in Mundri County.jpg|thumb|Using the traditional Moru hoe to clear a field ready for planting]]Most families are subsistence farmers depending on rain fed agriculture to produce food for their families.&lt;ref&gt;SHARLAND, Roger.W. (1989)	Using Indigenous Knowledge in Relation to Subsistence Sector Extension: Interaction between the Agricultural and Wild Environments in Moru Agriculture in Southern Sudan.  PhD Thesis AERDD, Reading University.&lt;/ref&gt;  Any surplus may be sold for cash or bartered for products that cannot be produced locally.  The staple crop is [[sorghum]] which is grown in various field types in association with [[sesame]], [[cowpeas]], [[bulrush millet]] and [[finger millet]].  Other important crops are [[Bambara groundnut|groundnuts]], [[maize]], [[cassava]], [[sweet potatoes]], [[okra]], pumpkins and various green vegetables.  Livestock are kept mainly on the northern and eastern sides of the district.  The most commonly kept animals are sheep and goats.  Poultry are kept by most households.  The number of cattle has increased during the last two decades.[[File:Harvested grain in Mundri.jpg|thumb|Recently harvested sorghum drying on a raised platform.  Sorghum is the main staple and there are a number of different varieties grown together.]]

Contact with the wild bush is important, and many of the relishes are obtained from wild sources.&lt;ref&gt;SHARLAND, Roger.W. (1989) Using Indigenous Knowledge in Relation to Subsistence Sector Extension: Interaction between the Agricultural and Wild Environments in Moru Agriculture in Southern Sudan.  PhD Thesis AERDD, Reading University.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;SHARLAND, Roger.W. (1991) "Trees in the garden: Interaction between the wild and agricultural domains in practice among the Moru of the Southern Sudan" in Unasylva vol. 42 No.164.&lt;/ref&gt;  Hunting and fishing are important economic and social activities.  Other wild foods include vegetables,&lt;ref&gt;SHARLAND, Roger.W. (1994)"Understanding weeds in a subsistence society&amp;nbsp;– Moru perception of herb species in the garden."  pp.;191–211 in AHMED, M.M.M. (ed) Indigenous Farming Systems, Knowledge and Practices in the Sudan.  Institute of African and Asian studies, University of Khartoum, Sudan.&lt;/ref&gt; wild fruit, fungi and insects, especially termites.  The bush is also the source of building materials, fuel and fibres.  The traditional way of cultivation is for close relatives to cultivate together in one area.  This is traditionally called a Kätiri, and is traditionally made of segments divided round a central marker such as a large tree or ant hill.&lt;ref&gt;CATFORD, J.R. (1951) ‘Kätiri Cultivation in the Moru District of Equatoria’.  Sudan Notes and Records Vol 32.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Dancing==
Between and during economic activities, the Moru spend a lot of time on other cultural pursuits which are of non-economic values. Predominant among the many cultural and social activities are dancing and singing. Both of these  activities serve as recreation and realization of cultural values.  Drumming, dancing and singing in Moru society are related to the three seasons. The correlation between the drumming, dancing and singing, the three seasonal periods, and general physical and economic welfare of the people, is one of the most interesting features of the Moru society.
&lt;ref&gt;FURULÄ, John Barayona. (1988) Moru Cultural Dance.  Moru Literature Project, Juba.&lt;/ref&gt;
From January to April, food is abundant, the people are healthy, physical labour is very little, and there is a great deal or idle time. During this time, the dance performed is called ''RUMA''. The number of drums used during this dance is four. The  biggest drum is called ''Dugye'' (sometimes also called ''Lari Endre'' ‘the mother drum’), the medium size drum is called Ruma, from which the dance takes its name, and the two small high pitched drums are called ''Lari Ngwa'' ‘Children of the Drum’.
From May to August, when there is a great deal of agricultural economic activities, the dancing is called ''DEGO''.  The number of drums  used during this dance is one ''Dugye'' and two small ''lari ngwa''. With the peoples' strength sapped by the heavy labours and the assumed or real scarcity of food, the movements or this dance begin slow in relation to the rhythm or the songs which is also slow. The movements progress to Ngala when the movements and steps become considerably quicker and faster. ''DEGO'' dances are infrequent and do not last a complete night.
From September to December the dance is called ''YELU''.  The number of drums used is five. They consist of one ''Dugye'', one ''Diri'' (also known as ''Biri'') and three small high-pitched drums ''Lari Ngwa''. The movements which are involved reflect the great health and strength which the people have just acquired as a result of eating freshly harvested crops.  ''YELU'' is the harvest season dance.

===Musical Instruments===
[[File:Moru gara.jpg|thumb|A rattle called gara is used by women in church or at dances.  It is made from a particular gourd filled with okra seeds.]]The ''Kudi'' and ''Lekyembe'' are harps which play important roles in Moru society. They serve as recreation and realization of cultural values. They particularly play a role during engagement between males and females. They are also used as important instruments for covering long distances and entertainment.

A rattle called ''gara'' is used by women in church or at dances.  It is made from a small [[gourd]] that has been dried. It has a spherical body and narrow tapering neck with rounded end that serves as the instrument's handle. It is filled with a number of medium-sized seeds, normally okra, inserted through a circular hole cut into the centre of the top, and then resealed.&lt;ref&gt;http://southernsudan.prm.ox.ac.uk/details/1979.20.11/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mutulu Shakur''' (born '''Jeral Wayne Williams'''; August 8, 1950) is an American activist and former member of the [[Black Liberation Army]], sentenced to sixty years in prison for his involvement in a [[Brink's robbery (1981)|1981 robbery of a Brinks armored truck]] in which a guard and two police officers were killed.

Shakur was a politically active as a teen with the [[Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM)]] and later the black separatist movement the [[Republic of New Afrika]]. He was stepfather to the late rap artist [[Tupac Shakur]].&lt;ref name="search"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bop.gov/iloc2/InmateFinderServlet?Transaction=NameSearch&amp;needingMoreList=false&amp;LastName=Shakur&amp;Middle=&amp;FirstName=Mutulu&amp;Race=U&amp;Sex=U&amp;Age=&amp;x=331&amp;y=291|title=Federal Bureau of Prisons|publisher=Bop.gov|accessdate=2013-05-03}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Personal life==
{{BLP sources|date=September 2018}}
Shakur was born in [[Baltimore, Maryland]], on August 8, 1950, as Jeral Wayne Williams. At age seven he moved to [[Jamaica, New York|Jamaica, Queens, New York City]] with his mother and younger sister.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.biography.com/people/mutulu-shakur-507004|title=Mutulu Shakur|website=Biography|language=en-us|access-date=2018-03-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By his late teens, he was politically active with the [[Revolutionary Action Movement (RAM)]] and later joined the Republic of New Afrika. He has four biological children and one surviving stepchild.{{citation needed|date=June 2017}}

In 1970, Shakur started working with the [[Lincoln Detox]] (detoxification) Community (addiction treatment) Program, which offered drug treatment to addicts using acupuncture vs the FDA approved drug methadone. He became certified and licensed to practice acupuncture in the State of California in 1976. Eventually he became the program’s assistant director and remained associated with the program until 1978. He went on to help found and direct the Black Acupuncture Advisory Association of North America (BAAANA) and the Harlem Institute of Acupuncture.

Since his incarceration, he founded a New York-based organization named Dare 2 Struggle that released a 10-year anniversary tribute album for Tupac Shakur called ''[[A 2Pac Tribute: Dare 2 Struggle]]'' in 2006 through music industry veteran Morey Alexander's First Kut Records and Canadian activist Deejay Ra's Lyrical Knockout Entertainment. The album features artists such as [[Mopreme Shakur]], [[Outlawz]], and Imaan Faith. As Shakur explains it, the CD was created in order to motivate, inspire, and challenge black people to struggle against their obstacles. He also recorded a radio PSA for Deejay Ra's "Hip-Hop Literacy" campaign, encouraging reading of books about Tupac. Shakur was interviewed in the [[Academy Awards|Oscar]]-nominated documentary ''Tupac: Resurrection'', in which he described how he wrote a "[[Thug Life]] Handbook" with Tupac, expressing an anti-drug and anti-violence message.

==Arrest and incarceration==
Shakur was one of six Black Liberation Army members to carry out the [[Brink's robbery (1981)]]. They stole $1.6 million in cash from a [[Brink's]] [[armored car (valuables)|armored car]] at the Nanuet Mall, in [[Nanuet, New York]], killing a Brink's guard, Peter Paige, seriously wounding another Brinks guard Joseph Trombino, and subsequently killing two Nyack police officers, [[Edward O'Grady II|Edward O'Grady]] and [[Waverly Brown]] (the first black member of the Nyack, New York, police department).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Batson|first1=Bill|title=Nyack Sketch Log: The Brink’s Robbery|url=http://www.nyacknewsandviews.com/2011/10/bb_brinksrobbery20111018/|website=NyackNewsandViews}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trombino recovered from the wounds he received in this incident but was killed in 2001 in the [[September 11 attacks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=

Shakur, the alleged ringleader of the group, evaded capture for six years and thus was the last one to go on trial on charges related to the robbery. In the 1980s, Shakur and [[Marilyn Buck]] were indicted on [[Racketeer Influenced and Corrupt Organizations Act]] (RICO) charges. While at large, on July 23, 1982, he became the 380th person added by the [[FBI Ten Most Wanted Fugitives, 1980s|FBI to the Ten Most Wanted Fugitives]] list.  He was arrested February 12, 1986, in California by the FBI. Shakur and Buck were tried in 1987 and convicted on May 11, 1988.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://query.nytimes.com/gst/fullpage.html?res=940DEED61E3AF931A25756C0A96E948260|title=2 Ex-fugitives Convicted of Roles in Fatal Armored-Truck Robbery|author=Lubasch, Arnold H.|publisher=''[[New York Times]]''|date=May 12, 1988|accessdate=2008-10-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although federal parole was abolished pursuant to the [[Sentencing Reform Act|Sentencing Reform Act of 1984]], Shakur's convictions were exempt because the Act's provisions didn't take effect until 1987. Thus, under the rules in effect at the time of his conviction, he was due for a mandatory parole determination after serving thirty of his original sixty-year sentence, which came in 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.law.cornell.edu/cfr/text/28/2.53|title=28 CFR 2.53 - Mandatory parole.|website=LII / Legal Information Institute|access-date=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the [[United States Parole Commission]] denied his release for unspecified grounds on April 7, 2016. Shakur's next parole eligibility review will occur in 2018,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/news/national/tupac-shakur-stepfather-mutulu-shakur-denied-parole-article-1.2610521|title=Tupac Shakur’s stepfather Mutulu Shakur denied parole|newspaper=NY Daily News|access-date=2016-12-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; and according to the Bureau of Prison, his sentence will be completed December 15, 2024.

'''Nominal identity''' is the [[identity (disambiguation)|identity]] in name only as opposed to the individual experience of that identity. The concept is often used in sociology, psychology and linguistics.

==Social sciences==
Nominal identity is the name to which one identifies, or calls oneself (i.e. general "African American," "Irish," "Straight," "Gay," "Female," "Male"). Whereas '''virtual identity''' is the experience of that identity, "The latter is, in a sense, what the name means; this is primarily a matter of its consequences for those who bear it, and can change while the nominal identity remains the same (and vice versa)."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Jenkins |first= Richard |title=Rethinking Ethnicity: Arguments and Explorations |publisher=Sage Publications LTD |year=2001 |location=London, UK |page=72 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=qoOj0SSrQrYC&amp;pg=PA72&amp;lpg=PA72&amp;dq=definition+of+%22nominal+identity%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=ZnfdIAETQH&amp;sig=MWuGxzYHP_0uU-gENR0_tEDEP4I&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gz6dS_KYIML38AbCl5icDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=4&amp;ved=0CBIQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=definition%20of%20%22nominal%20identity%22&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those who self-identify as "gay," the term may not confer the same experience for two people or even between various geographical or cultural regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Jenkins |first=Richard |title=Social Identity |publisher=Routledge |year=2008 |location=Oxon, UK |page=100 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hRIe8YaaBIIC&amp;pg=PA100&amp;lpg=PA100&amp;dq=definition+of+%22nominal+identity%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=YVpKCmNEHi&amp;sig=fVvb72cDaQCPAQMvWP3fK97xUZo&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gz6dS_KYIML38AbCl5icDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=7&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwBg#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, while one may talk about a "chair," "chair" itself can entail many forms, from arm chair to ladder back to even tree stump, if the experience of "chair" is something upon which a person sits.

[[Pierre Bourdieu]] uses the term nominal identity in ''[[Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste]]'' to mean both that which the identity of a subject is named and also where identity is an insignificant measurement or representation of the "perceived reality" of a subject or phenomenon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bourdieu |first=Pierre |authorlink= Pierre Bourdieu |author2=Translated by Richard Nice  |title=Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1984 |location= Cambridge, MA |page=18 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVaS6gS9Jz4C&amp;pg=PA18&amp;dq=bourdieu+%22nominal+identity+of+the+%27indicators%27&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Bourdieu |first=Pierre |authorlink=Pierre Bourdieu |author2=Translated by Richard Nice  |title=Distinction: A Social Critique of the Judgment of Taste |publisher=Harvard University Press |year=1984 |location=Cambridge, MA |page=194 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nVaS6gS9Jz4C&amp;pg=PA194&amp;dq=bourdieu+%22nominal+identity+%28that%22&amp;cd=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; To further clarify, for Bourdieu nominal identity can often mean "face value" or "appearance." He often mentions the term nominal identity in order to illustrate the idea of a more complex reality, beyond the name, within the studied subject.

===Nominal identity in ethnicity===
Ethnic identity is a "social identity arising through group formation, individual identification with a group, and interaction between different ethnic groups."&lt;ref name="wrong"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Categorically Wrong? Nominal versus Graded Measures of Ethnic Identity |journal=Linguistics and Philosophy |date=2000-09-01 |first=Henry E. |last=Brady |author2=Cynthia S. Kaplan  |volume=35 |issue=3 |pages=56–91 |doi=10.1007/BF02699766 |url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/lf5autv45gqym5we/ |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Henry E. Brady and Cynthia S. Kaplan compiled a study called "Categorically Wrong? Nominal versus Graded Measures of Ethnic Identity" that takes a look at ethnicity as a nominal identity. Their study proposed whether or not "the attitudes of members of the group with the more salient identity can be completely explained by its nominal identity while the attitudes of the members of the group with less salient identity require a graded measure of ethnicity."&lt;ref name="wrong"/&gt;

Brady and Kaplan focused on the country Estonia, where they posited two groups: "Estonians," and one that they call the "Slavs," a collective group of Russians, Ukrainians, or Belarusians. They chose this geographical area in particular because of the "centrality of ethnicity in the politics of transition in the USSR."&lt;ref name="wrong"/&gt; media usage (such as television, radio, or newspaper, whether it was the Estonia language Republic television or Russian-language media), individuals who identify themselves with another nationality, and the language used at home.

Brady and Kaplan concluded that "ethnicity is not always a nominal characteristic"&lt;ref name="wrong"/&gt; for these two groups in Estonia. It is only nominal when most salient. "Ethnic identity ... causes individuals within a group to form their attitudes based upon their nominal identity".&lt;ref name="wrong"/&gt; Individuals may generalize themselves in a certain category such as their nationality, but when it comes down to variables of different degrees in formulating their ethnicity, it is no longer nominal. It is their way of dividing themselves from a generalized name.

==Linguistics==
Nominal identity in [[linguistics]] pertains to the identity of a word or group of words functioning as a noun or an adjective within a sentence's structure. Specifically, it relates to how one can look at a sentence and propose a different understanding of that sentence through the analysis of its identity defined in its lexical construct, such as in the example used by Chris Barker&lt;ref name="Barker"&gt;{{cite journal |title=Squibs and Discussion: Individuation and Quantification. |journal=Linguistic Inquiry |date=Fall 1999 |first=Chris |last= Barker |volume=30 |issue=4 |pages=683–691 |url=http://www.mitpressjournals.org/doi/abs/10.1162/002438999554264 |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-03-23 |doi=10.1162/002438999554264}}&lt;/ref&gt; when discussing one of [[Manfred Krifka]]'s study "Four thousand ships passed through the lock: Object-induced measure functions on events":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Four thousand ships passed through the lock: Object-induced measure functions on events |journal=Linguistics and Philosophy |year=1990 |first=Manfred |last=Krifka |volume=13 |pages=487–520 |url= http://semantics.uchicago.edu/kennedy/classes/s07/events/krifka90.pdf |format=PDF |accessdate=2010-03-23 |doi=10.1007/bf00627291}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"(1) Four thousand ships passed through the lock last year."&lt;ref name="Barker"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

On the surface, the proposition suggests that 4,000 distinct ships passed through the lock last year. However, as Krifka points out in his study, one could say that there were fewer than 4,000 distinct ships and that some of those ships passed through the lock more than once. Individuals reading this sentence could argue about the interpretation of this sentence. The outcome could be many interpretations when looking at the sentence more closely and determining what variables were taken into consideration when making this statement.&lt;ref name="Barker"/&gt;

The '''Nubi language''' (also called '''Ki-Nubi''') is a [[Sudanese Arabic]]-based [[creole language]] spoken in [[Uganda]] around [[Bombo, Uganda|Bombo]], and in [[Kenya]] around [[Kibera]], by the descendants of [[Emin Pasha]]'s [[Sudan]]ese soldiers who were settled there by the [[British Empire|British colonial administration]]. It was spoken by about 15,000 people in [[Uganda]] in 1991 (according to the census), and an estimated 10,000 in Kenya; another source estimates about 50,000 speakers as of 2001. 90% of the [[lexicon]] derives from [[Arabic language|Arabic]],&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Ineke Wellens. ''The Nubi Language of Uganda: An Arabic Creole in Africa''. BRILL, 2005 {{ISBN|90-04-14518-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the grammar has been simplified,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Modern Arabic: Structures, Functions, and Varieties |author=Clive Holes |year=2004 |publisher=Georgetown U P |isbn=9781589010222 |pages=421 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8E0Rr1xY4TQC&amp;pg=PA26&amp;lpg=PA26 |accessdate=2017-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; as has the sound system.

The Nubi speakers are [[Kakwa people|Kakwa]] who came from the Nubian region, first into [[Equatoria]], and from there southwards into Uganda and the [[Democratic Republic of the Congo]]. [[Idi Amin]], who was Kakwa, recruited the Kawa and [[Nubians]] into his army, to kill the [[Acholi people|Acholi]] and [[Lango people|Lango]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EkSP9XUIAKsC&amp;pg=PA81&amp;lpg=PA81&amp;dq=kakwa+nubians&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vo4OICTTZE&amp;sig=-C22qmbLmekVtHrJEPs79uNbkwA&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjQj4TxpoTSAhVD-GMKHUxtBXwQ6AEIKTAD#v=onepage&amp;q=kakwa%20nubians&amp;f=false|title=Uganda Since Independence: A Story of Unfulfilled Hopes|last=Mutibwa|first=Phares Mukasa|date=1992-01-01|publisher=Africa World Press|isbn=9780865433571|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1977/04/06/amin-buys-loyalty-of-soldiers/92db022c-dc34-4a6a-af97-56eae2ccf728/&lt;/ref&gt;

Jonathan Owens argues that Nubi constitutes a major counterexample to [[Derek Bickerton]]'s theories of [[creole language]] formation, showing "no more than a chance resemblance to Bickerton's universal creole features" despite fulfilling perfectly the historical conditions expected to lead to such features.{{Citation needed|date=March 2017}}

==Grammar==

=== Phonology ===

====Vowels&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;====
There are five vowels in Nubi. Vowels are not distinguished by length except in at least two exceptions from Kenyan Nubi (which are not present in Ugandan dialects) where ''"bara"'' means ''"outside"'' and is an adverb while ''"baara"'' means ''"the outside"'' and is a noun, and also where ''"saara"'' meaning ''"bewitch"'' is compared to ''"sara"'' meaning ''"herd, cattle".'' Despite this, there is a tendency for vowels in stressed syllables to be registered as long vowels.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Speakers may use [[Arabic phonology|Standard Arabic phonemes]] for words for which the Arabic pronunciation has been learned. The a [[Retroflex consonant|retroflex]] version of the /r/ sound may also occur and some dialects use /l/ in its place. [[Gemination|Geminates]] are very unusual in Nubi. These less common phonemes are shown in brackets.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Ineke Wellens gives the following orthography for Nubi where it differs from the IPA symbols: /{{IPA|ʃ}}/ = sh; /t{{IPA|ʃ}}/ = ch; /{{IPA|dʒ}}/ = j; /{{IPA|ɲ}}/ = ny; /w/ = w or u; /j/ = y or i; /{{IPA|θ}}/ = th; /{{IPA|ð}}/ = dh; /x/ = kh; /{{IPA|ħ}}/ = ḥ.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==== Syllable Structure ====
[[Syllable|Syllables]] typically have a CV, VC, V or CVC structure with VC only occurring in initial syllables. Final and initial CC occur only in a few specific examples such as ''"skul"'' which means ''"school"'' or ''"sems"'' which means ''"sun"''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[Stress (linguistics)|Stress]] can change the meaning of words for example ''"saba"'' means ''"seven"'' or ''"morning"'' depending on whether the stress is on the first or second syllables respectively. Vowels are often omitted in unstressed, final syllables and sometime even the stressed final ''"u"'' in the passive form may be deleted after ''"m", "n", "l", "f"'' or ''"b".'' This can caused syllables to be realigned even across words.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Nominals ===
[[Noun|Nouns]] are [[Inflection|inflected]] by [[Grammatical number|number]] only (taking a singular or plural form) although for most nouns this does not represent a [[Morphology (linguistics)|morphological]] change. Jonathan Owens gives 5 broad [[Noun class|noun classes]] of nouns:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;
# Nouns which undergo a stress shift when the plural is formed.
# Nouns which undergo [[apophony]].
# Nouns which take a suffix and undergo a stress shift in the plural form.
# Nouns which form the plural by [[suppletion]]
# [[Bantu languages|Bantu]] [[Loanword|loan-words]] which take different prefixes in the singular and plural forms
The table below shows examples of each type of pluralisation. The apostrophe has been placed before the stressed syllable:&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;''"Nuswan"'' may be supplemented by a suffix as if it were type 3, thus, ''"nuswana"'' could also mean ''"women".''&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

[[Adjective|Adjectives]] follow the noun and some adjectives have singular and plural forms which must agree with the noun. Adjectives may also take the prefixes ''"al", "ali", "ab"'' or ''"abu"'' which mark them as [[Habitual aspect|habitual]]. When a noun is a possessor follow the possessed noun and is mark with the particle ''"ta"'' which is placed between the two nouns.

'''Palestinians in Egypt''' refers to the [[Palestinian refugee]]s who fled to Egypt during the [[1948 Palestine war]], and their descendants, as well as Palestinians expelled from Jordan, following the events of [[Black September in Jordan|Black September]]. Some Palestinians and their descendants have never been naturalized and so keep the distinct status of Palestinian refugee. Other Palestinians, mostly Christians,{{citation needed|date=May 2017}}  received Egyptian citizenship through marriage with Egyptian nationals or by other means.

Furthermore, Palestinians refugees benefit from special rights granted by Egyptian Law. They can attend Egyptian public schools, access to healthcare, and have the same rights as Egyptian citizens except the right to vote.

There was also an earlier wave of Palestinian immigration, in which Palestinian Christians settled in Egypt during the [[Ottoman Syria|Ottoman era]], along with [[Lebanese people|Lebanese]] and [[Syrians]], forming what was known as the "[[Syro-Lebanese in Egypt|Shawam]]" (شوام) community.
 
Estimates of the size of the Palestinian population in Egypt range from 270,245 to 300,000{{Citation needed|date=September 2018}}.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3455">[[Iran]] uses three official calendar systems, including the [[Solar Hijri calendar]] as the main and national calendar, the [[Gregorian calendar]] for international events and Christian holidays, and the [[Islamic calendar]] ([[Lunar calendar]]) for Islamic holidays.

The surfeit of public holidays has been a subject of concern for almost 30 years. A substantial number of unofficial holidays are added each year to the national holidays that further aggravate the situation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.iran-daily.com/1387/3267/html/national.htm |title=Iran Daily - National - 11/11/08 |accessdate=2017-06-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090515001536/http://www.iran-daily.com/1387/3267/html/national.htm |archivedate=May 15, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Iran has the most public holidays in the world with around 25 holidays. The holidays in Iran may differ regarding the Arabic Calendar.[http://publicholidays.me/iran/][http://www.qppstudio.net/publicholidays2016/iran.htm]

'''Simon Oakland''' (August 28, 1915 – August 29, 1983) was an American actor of stage, screen, and television.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;  During his career, Oakland performed primarily on television, appearing in over 130 series and made-for-television movies between 1951 and 1983.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0643000/ "Simon Oakland"], Internet Movie Database ([[IMDb]]).  Retrieved April 27, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and career==
Oakland was born in the [[Brooklyn]] borough of [[New York City]], the son of Jacob Weiss and Ethel Oaklander. His father was a plasterer and builder.&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Villain on the screen really is a nice guy|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=-fhHAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=BAANAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4105%2C5627166|accessdate=3 March 2016|work=The Morning Record|date=9 December 1967|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt; While he later claimed in media interviews to have been born in 1922&lt;ref name=wilson/&gt;&lt;ref name=blank/&gt; (a date repeated in his ''[[New York Times]]'' obituary),&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite news|title=Simon Oakland, 61, Actor who starred in 3 TV series, dies|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1983/09/01/obituaries/simon-oakland-61-actor-who-starred-in-3-tv-series-dies.html|accessdate=1 March 2016|work=[[New York Times]]|date=1 September 1983}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Michigan Obituaries, 1820-2006|url=https://familysearch.org/pal:/MM9.3.1/TH-1961-42398-3942-23?cc=221569|website=FamilySearch|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Social Security (United States)|Social Security]] and [[vital records]] indicate he was born '''Simon Weiss''' in 1915; his [[stage name]] was likely derived from his mother's maiden name, Oaklander.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Death Records|url=http://vitals.rootsweb.ancestry.com/ca/death/search.cgi|website=RootsWeb|accessdate=2 April 2016}} Duplicate entries under surname Weiss and Oakland with same Social Security number.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Death Index, 1940-1997|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VG1Z-HJM|website=FamilySearch|accessdate=2 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=California Death Index, 1940-1997|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:VP8M-21D|website=FamilySearch|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Social Security Death Index|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:JT14-C6N|website=FamilySearch|accessdate=1 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|group=Note|Some primary sources suggest his birth name may have been '''Isidor Weiss'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=United States Census, 1930|url=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/1:1:X4V8-3W2|quote=Isidor Weiss in household of Jacob Weiss, Brooklyn|website=Family Search|accessdate=3 June 2016}} {{registration}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=New York, New York, Births, 1910-1965|url=https://www.ancestry.com/inst/discoveries/PfRecord?emailId=N-94baad5d-c64d-4bc3-9abb-3be6f5302c00&amp;collectionId=61457&amp;recordId=865994&amp;ahsht=2018-02-02T02:05:06&amp;language=en-US&amp;ahsh=12f2634fd6b1cede02f7f82bbc4a17b3|website=Ancestry.com|publisher=New York City Department of Health|accessdate=2 February 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; One source reported that his "real name" was ''Si Oaklander'',&lt;ref name=wilson&gt;{{cite news|last1=Wilson|first1=Earl|title=People Recognise His Face But Not Oakland's Name|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=wT41AAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=amcEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6752%2C6147391|accessdate=1 March 2016|work=[[Sarasota Herald-Tribune]]|date=14 May 1977|page=11A}}&lt;/ref&gt; but this is contradicted by the weight of evidence.}}

He began his [[performing arts]] career as a [[musician]] (he was a [[violin]]ist,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Thompson|first1=Ruth|title=More Than 800 Programs for Simon Oakland|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=r2wmAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=lP8FAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2493%2C176288|accessdate=3 March 2016|work=The Gettysburg Times|issue=TV Magazine|date=28 October 1968|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[avocation]] he would pursue during his entire career as an actor). Oakland began his acting career in the late 1940s. He enjoyed a series of [[Broadway (theatre)|Broadway]] hits, including ''Light Up the Sky'', ''[[The Shrike (play)|The Shrike]]'' and ''[[Inherit the Wind (play)|Inherit the Wind]]'', and [[theater]] was one of his lasting passions. He was a concert violinist until the 1940s.

==Moving to films and television==
In 1955 Oakland made his film debut, though uncredited, as an Indiana state trooper in ''[[The Desperate Hours (film)|The Desperate Hours]]''.  He next appeared in two films released in 1958:  as the character Mavrayek in ''[[The Brothers Karamazov (1958 film)|The Brothers Karamazov]]'' and then in the role of [[Edward S. Montgomery|Edward Montgomery]] in ''[[I Want to Live!]]''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0643000/ "Simon Oakland"], IMDb.  Retrieved April 27, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  The character Montgomery was a real-life journalist, who had reported on the California murder trial and 1955 execution of [[Barbara Graham]], played by [[Susan Hayward]] in the film.  Oakland's portrayal of the journalist as a "tough, but compassionate" personality resulted in the actor's often being [[Typecasting (acting)|typecast]] in his subsequent roles in both films and on television.

Simon Oakland's notable performance in ''I Want to Live!'' led to his playing a long series of tough-guy types, usually in positions of authority, most notably in ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'', in which he plays the psychiatrist who explains [[Norman Bates]]'s [[multiple personality disorder]]. He also appeared in ''[[West Side Story (film)|West Side Story]]'', ''[[The Sand Pebbles (film)|The Sand Pebbles]]'', and ''[[Bullitt]]''. He made two guest appearances on [[CBS]]'s ''[[Perry Mason (TV series)|Perry Mason]]'', both times as the murder victim. He also appeared in the [[Broadcast syndication|syndicated]] crime drama, ''[[Decoy (TV series)|Decoy]]'', starring [[Beverly Garland]]. Oakland appeared once each on the CBS western, ''[[Dundee and the Culhane]]'' and in another syndicated crime drama series, ''[[Sheriff of Cochise]]'', starring [[John Bromfield]]. Oakland played the regular role of General Thomas Moore on [[NBC]]'s ''[[Baa Baa Black Sheep (TV series)|Baa Baa Black Sheep]]'', starring [[Robert Conrad]]. He also appeared in two episodes of the original ''[[The Twilight Zone]]'' TV series. In 1974 and 1975, he was a series regular on ''[[Kolchak: The Night Stalker]]'', playing newspaper editor Tony Vincenzo. (He'd previously played the same character in the two made-for-television movies that served as the pilot for the series.)

Oakland was the familiar voice-over for the tag line "When It Absolutely, Positively Has To Be There Overnight" heard at the end of each television commercial for the long-running Federal Express advertising campaign, created by the New York advertising agency Ally &amp; Gargano.{{fact|date=July 2018}} 

He also played the role of a Sony dealer for an ad campaign of ten national radio commercials, written and directed by Peter Hoffman, for the New York office of the global advertising agency McCann-Erickson when they had the Sony account.{{fact|date=July 2018}}

==Personal life==
Oakland was married to Lois Lorraine Porta (1918–2003).&lt;ref name=blank&gt;{{cite news|title=Simon Oakland: 'Face is Familiar - What's his name?'|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=xXsfAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=NVMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=7108%2C1400924|last1=Blank|first1=Edward L.|accessdate=2 March 2016|work=[[The Pittsburgh Press]]|date=3 January 1972|page=39}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SFNM"&gt;{{cite news|title=Funeral Services &amp; Memorials: Lois Lorraine Oakland, 84|url=https://newspaperarchive.com/profile/phil-nesci/clipnumber/29000/|accessdate=30 March 2016|work=Santa Fe New Mexican|date=9 April 2003|location=New Mexico|page=12|via=[[Newspaperarchive.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The couple had one daughter, Barbara.&lt;ref name=nyt /&gt;

==Death==
Simon Oakland continued working up to the year of his death. His last credited acting appearance was in the episode "Living and Presumed Dead" on the [[CBS]] television series ''[[Tucker's Witch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0734112/?ref_=nm_flmg_act_1 "Living and Presumed Dead",] ''Tucker's Witch'' episode S01E11, originally broadcast May 5, 1983. IMDb.  Retrieved April 28, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;  That episode aired just three months before Oakland died of colon cancer in [[Cathedral City, California]], on August 29, 1983, a day after the actor's 68th birthday.

{{Dutch dialects}}

'''South Guelderish''' (Dutch: ''Zuid-Gelders'', German: ''Südgeldersch'', ''Kleverländisch'') refers to the easternmost group of [[Dutch language|Dutch]] dialects spoken along the lower Rhine (Dutch [[Nederrijn]] and German [[Lower Rhine region|Niederrhein]]). In its narrower sense, the term refers strictly to the Rivierenlands, [[Nijmegen|Nijmeegs]], and Liemers sub-dialects; in its broader sense, the term encompasses also North Limburgish in the [[Netherlands]] and Kleverlander (around [[Kleve|Cleves]]; Dutch ''Kleverlands'', German ''Kleverländisch'') and [[East Bergish]] in [[Germany]]. South Guelderish (in the narrow sense) — especially Rivierenlands — is sometimes included as part of [[Brabantic]], a more widely spoken Dutch dialect and the closest relative of South Guelderish. Alternatively, it is considered to extend southward into Northern [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]] until the [[Uerdingen line]]. It is arguably more appropriate to group South Guelderish (narrow sense), North Limburgish, Kleverlander, and East Bergish into one dialect group—East Dutch.  

In the Netherlands, South Guelderish is spoken in the following regions: North [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]], the [[Veluwezoom National Park]], [[Rijk van Nijmegen]], [[Land van Maas en Waal]], the [[Bommelerwaard]], the [[Tielerwaard]], the [[Betuwe]], [[Land van Cuijk]] and [[Liemers (region)|Liemers]].

==Status==
The status of East Dutch differs greatly between the Netherlands and Germany. On the Dutch side, East Dutch is subject to the influence of Standard Dutch. Since it is a Dutch dialect, it is already similar enough to the standard language to have had relatively little influence. In Germany, however, since 1713, when Prussia took control of the area, Kleverlander and East Bergish have been in retreat under the pressure of Standard German to which they are only distantly related. The dialects, mainly in their vocabulary, have been influenced.

Furthermore, large-scale [[industrialization]] in the [[Kleve|Cleves]]–[[Duisburg]] area in Germany, as well as the resulting [[immigration]], during the late 19th century and the 20th century, has greatly reduced its use today, leaving very few native speakers. For example, in Duisburg (though traditionally within the South Guelderish area), it has virtually died out. (See [[Duisburg Platt Dialect]]).

As noted before, South Guelderish is sometimes included within Brabantic. That is because there exists no tight [[isogloss]] bundle between the Brabantic and South Guelderish dialects. Instead, change occurs in two individual steps: the ''alt''-''oud'' isogloss, between [[Groesbeek]] and [[Nijmegen]], and the ''ies''-''ijs'' isogloss, west of Nijmegen.

==Trivia==
* A dialect of South Guelderish origin spoken in the United States is [[Pella Dutch]]. 
* The [[Limburg (Netherlands)|Limburg]]ish band [[Rowwen Hèze]] sings in North Limburgish, a subdialect of South Gelderish.

'''Stella Nova''' is one of New Zealand's largest [[science fiction fandom]] associations. Originally known as the ''Science Fiction Modellers' Club of New Zealand'', it is based in [[Auckland]], the country's largest city, where it is the largest sf fan club, catering for fans of [[science fiction]], [[fantasy]], and related activities such as [[role-playing game|role-playing gaming]].  As of August 2008, the club had about 30 members.

While currently more quiescent, the club's activities have previously included model-making, producing fan videos, and publishing a fanzine.

Members of Stella Nova have been run several New Zealand National [[Science Fiction Convention]]s, including ''OdysseyCon'' in 2001, ''EmotiCon'' in 2003, ''ConTour'' in 2004, ''Conclave'' in 2006, and ''ConScription'' in 2009. ([[New Zealand National Science Fiction Convention]]s are held each year, frequently alternating between [[Auckland]] and [[Wellington]].)

==Notable members==
[[Philippa Boyens]], Norman Cates, Mary MacLachlan, and Wayne Taz Stables are ex-members who have been active in the club's model-making or fan video production, and have since progressed to fantasy film production on feature films such as [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)]].

The '''Tankas''' ({{zh|t=[[wikt:蜑|蜑]]家|s=[[wikt:疍|疍]]家|p=Dànjiā|cy=Daahngā}}) or '''boat people''' are an ethnic subgroup in [[Southern China]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Maria Jaschok |author2=Suzanne Miers |editor1=Maria Jaschok |editor2=Suzanne Miers |title=Women and Chinese patriarchy: submission, servitude, and escape |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f5o_t7VxHYAC&amp;pg=PA237 |year=1994 |publisher=Zed Books |isbn=1-85649-126-9 |page=xvi |quote=Tanka, a marginalised boat people which could be found in the Southern provinces of China.}}&lt;/ref&gt; who have traditionally lived on [[junk (ship)|junks]] in coastal parts of [[Guangdong]], [[Guangxi]], [[Fujian]], [[Hainan]], and [[Zhejiang]], as well as [[Hong Kong]], and [[Macau]]. Though many now live onshore, some from the older generations still live on their boats and pursue their traditional livelihood of fishing. Historically, the Tankas were considered to be [[outcast (person)|outcast]]s. Since they were boat people who lived by the sea, they were sometimes referred to as "'''sea [[gypsies]]'''" by the Chinese and British. Tanka origins can be traced back to the native ethnic minorities of southern China who may have taken refuge on the sea and gradually assimilated into [[Han culture]]. However, Tanka have preserved many of their native traditions that are not found in [[Han Chinese culture]].

A small number of Tankas also live in parts of [[Vietnam]]. There they are called '''Dan''' ({{lang|vi|Đàn}}) and are classified as a subgroup of the [[Ngái]] ethnicity.

"Boat people" was a general category for both the Tanka and the [[Hoklo people|Hoklo]], who also made their living on boats. They spoke different dialects, and the Hoklo originated from [[Fujian]]. The Hoklo used the term Hoklo to refer to themselves, while the name Tanka was used only by Cantonese to describe the Tanka.

There were two distinct categories of people based on their way of life, and they were further divided into different groups.

Chinese scholars and gazettes described the Tanka as a "Yao" tribe, with some other sources noting that "Tan" people lived at Lantau, and other sources saying "Yao" people lived there. As a result, they refused to obey the salt monopoly of the [[Song dynasty]] Chinese government. The county gazetteer of Sun on in 1729 described the Tanka as "Yao barbarians", and the Tanka were viewed as animals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Meacham |title=The Archaeology of Hong Kong |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WZ-jF8sCV4YC&amp;pg=PA162|year=2008 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |isbn=962-209-925-4 |page=162 |quote=Other sources mention "Yao" who also lived on Lantau. Chinese sources describe several efforts to bring these folk to heel and, finally, a campaign to annihilate them... Later sources refer to the Tanka boat people as "Yao" or "barbarian," and for centuries they were shunned and not allowed to settle on land. Even as late as 1729, the Sun on county gazetteer recorded that "in Guangdong there is a tribe of Yao barbarians called the Tanka, who have boats for homes and live by fishing." These presumed remnants of the Yueh and their traditional way of life were looked down upon by the Han Chinese through the centuries,}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Wolfram Eberhard suggested that the Yueh are related to the Tanka, that the Chinese admixture in the Tanka is due to the Tanka prostitutes serving Chinese, and that the Tanka replaced their own culture with Chinese culture, including the Chinese language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Wolfram Eberhard |title=China's minorities: yesterday and today |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=OmewTouZAoj00gHM4I3nAQ&amp;ct=result&amp;id=QhRHAAAAMAAJ |year=1982 |publisher=Wadsworth |isbn=0-534-01080-6 |page=89 |quote=Several styles of Chinese music come from Southern non-Chinese.

===Historiography===
Some southern Chinese historic views of the Tanka were that they were a separate aboriginal ethnic group, "not Han Chinese at all".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Leo J.

Often this view was embroidered with tales about how the Tanka had short legs, good only for shipboard life. Some stories alleged that they had six toes and even a tail. It was commonly asserted that they spoke their own aboriginal}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese Imperial records also claim that the Tanka were descendants of aboriginals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=C.

The Tanka were regarded as Yueh and not Chinese, they were divided into three classifications, "the fish-Tan, the oyster-Tan, and the wood-Tan" in the 12th century, based on what they did for a living.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=R.

The three groups of Punti, Hakka, and Hoklo, all of whom spoke different Chinese dialects, despised and fought each other during the late Qing dynasty.

The [[Nankai University]] of [[Tianjin]] published the Nankai social and economic quarterly, Volume 9 in 1936, and it referred to the Tanka as aboriginal descendants before Chinese assimilation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Nan kai da xue (Tianjin, China).

===Scholarly opinions on Baiyue connection===
The most widely held theory is that the Tanka are the descendants of the native Yue inhabitants of Guangdong before the Han Cantonese moved in.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Eugene Newton Anderson |title=The floating world of Castle Peak Bay |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=fw02TrngHNCUtwfJzo3uDA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=N5qfAAAAMAAJ|volume=Volume 4 of Anthropological studies |year=1970 |publisher=American Anthropological Association |page=13 |quote=The most widely accepted theory of the origins of these people is that they are derived from the aboriginal tribes of the area.

Ho concludes that the word Tan originally covered a specific tribe, then was extended like Man further north to cover various groups. At first it referred to the Patung Tan people, then to the Lingnan Tan, i.e.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A minority of scholars who challenged this theory deny that the Tanka are descended from natives, instead claiming they are basically the same as other Han Cantonese who dwell on land, claiming that neither the land dwelling Han Cantonese nor the water dwelling Tanka have more aboriginal blood than the other, with the Tanka boat people being as Chinese and as Han as ordinary Cantonese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Eugene Newton Anderson |title=The floating world of Castle Peak Bay |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=fw02TrngHNCUtwfJzo3uDA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=N5qfAAAAMAAJ |volume=Volume 4 of Anthropological studies |year=1970 |publisher=American Anthropological Association |page=13 |quote=and boat people are such as one would expect between groups leading such different ways of life. in culture, the boat people are Chinese. Ward (1965) and McCoy (1965) point out that the land people are probably not free from aboriginal intermixture themselves, and conclude that the boat people are probably not more mixed. As Ward states, "(l)... the boat-people's descent is probably neither more nor less 'non-Han' than that of most other Cantonese-speaking inhabitants of Kwangtung.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Eugene Newton Anderson claimed that there was no evidence for any of the conjectures put forward by scholars on the Tanka's origins, citing Chen, who stated that "to what tribe or race they once belonged or were once akin to is still unknown".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Eugene Newton Anderson |title=The floating world of Castle Peak Bay |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=fw02TrngHNCUtwfJzo3uDA&amp;ct=result&amp;id=N5qfAAAAMAAJ |volume=Volume 4 of Anthropological studies |year=1970 |publisher=American Anthropological Association |page=15 |quote=Neither theory for the origin of the boat people has much proof. Neither would stand up in court. Chen's conclusion is still valid today: "...to what tribe or race they once belonged or were once akin to is still unknown." (Chen, 1935:272)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some researchers say the origin of the Tanka is multifaceted, with a portion of them having native Yueh ancestors and others originating from other sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=梁廣漢 |title=Profile of historic relics in the early stage of Hong Kong |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=iktGAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=tanka+aboriginal&amp;dq=tanka+aboriginal&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=-5-0To_MH4bt0gG2_qHSBw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CCwQ6AEwADgy |year=1980 |publisher=學津書店 |page=57 |quote=Tanka – They are boat-dwellers.

The [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]], who were granted [[Macau]] during the [[Ming dynasty]], often married Tanka women since Han Chinese women would not have relations with them. Some of the Tanka's descendants became [[Macanese people]].

Some Tanka children were enslaved by Portuguese raiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Charles Ralph Boxer|title=Fidalgos in the Far East, 1550–1770: fact and fancy in the history of Macau|url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=r-NOT8r_JoaQ0QGBhYzdDQ&amp;id=kePUAAAAMAAJ|year=1948|publisher=M.

The Chinese poet Wu Li wrote a poem, which included a line about the Portuguese in Macau being supplied with fish by the Tanka.&lt;ref&gt;Chaves, p. 53: Wu Li, like Bocarro, noted the presence in Macau both of black slaves and of non-Han Chinese such as the Tanka boat people, and in the third poem of his sequence he combines references to these two groups: Yellow sand, whitewashed houses: here the black men live; willows at the gates like sedge, still not sparse in autumn.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaves, p. 54: Midnight's when the Tanka come and make their harbor here; fasting kitchens for noonday meals have plenty of fresh fish. . .The second half of the poem unfolds a scene of Tanka boat people bringing in fish to supply the needs of fasting Christians.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaves, p. 141: Yellow sand, whitewashed houses: here the black men live; willows at the gates like sedge, still not sparse in autumn. Midnight's when the Tanka come and make their harbor here; fasting kitchens for noonday meals have plenty of fresh fish.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chaves, p. 53: The residents Wu Li strives to reassure (in the third line of this poem) consisted — at least in 1635 when Antonio Bocarro, Chronicler-in-Chief of the State of India, wrote his detailed account of Macau (without actually having visited there) — of some 850 Portuguese families with "on the average about six slaves capable of bearing arms, amongst whom the majority and the best are negroes and such like," as well as a like number of "native families, including Chinese Christians . . . who form the majority [of the non-Portuguese residents] and other nations, all Christians." 146 (Bocarro may have been mistaken in declaring that all the Chinese in Macau were Christians.)&lt;/ref&gt;

When the Portuguese arrived at Macau, women from [[Goa]] (part of [[Portuguese India]]), [[Siam]], [[Indochina]], and [[Malay Peninsula|Malaya]] became their wives, rarely were they Chinese women.&lt;ref&gt;João de Pina-Cabral, p. 39: To be a Macanese is fundamentally to be from Macau with Portuguese ancestors, but not necessarily to be of Sino-Portuguese descent. The local community was born from Portuguese men. [...] but in the beginning the woman was Goanese, Siamese, Indo-Chinese, Malay – they came to Macau in our boats. Sporadically it was a Chinese woman.&lt;/ref&gt; The Tanka women were among the only people in China willing to mix and marry with the Portuguese, with other Chinese women refusing to do so.&lt;ref&gt;João de Pina-Cabral, p. 39: When we established ourselves here, the Chinese ostracized us. The Portuguese had their wives, then, that came from abroad, but they could have no contact with the Chinese women, except the fishing folk, the Tanka women and the female slaves. Only the lowest class of Chinese contacted with the Portuguese in the first centuries. Later the strength of Christianization, of the priests, started to convince the Chinese to become Catholic. [...] But, when they started to be Catholics, they adopted Portuguese baptismal names and were ostracized by the Chinese Buddhists. So they joined the Portuguese community and their sons started having Portuguese education without a single drop of Portuguese blood.&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of marriages between Portuguese and natives was between Portuguese men and women of Tanka origin, who were considered the lowest class of people in China and had relations with Portuguese settlers and sailors, or low class Chinese women.&lt;ref&gt;João de Pina-Cabral, p. 164: I was personally told of people that, to this day, continue to hide the fact that their mothers had been lower-class Chinese women—often even tanka (fishing folk) women who had relations with Portuguese sailors and soldiers.&lt;/ref&gt; Western men like the Portuguese were refused by high class Chinese women, who did not marry foreigners.&lt;ref&gt;João de Pina-Cabral, p. 165: In fact, in those days, the matrimonial context of production was usually constituted by Chinese women of low socio-economic status who were married to or concubies of Portuguese or Macanese men. Very rarely did Chinese women of higher status agree to marry a Westerner. As Deolinda argues in one of her short stories,"8 should they have wanted to do so out of romantic infatuation, they would not be allowed to&lt;/ref&gt;

Literature in Macau was written about love affairs and marriage between the Tanka women and Portuguese men, like "A-Chan, A Tancareira", by Henrique de Senna Fernandes.&lt;ref&gt;João de Pina-Cabral, p. 164: Henrique de Senna Fernandes, another Macanese author, wrote a short story about a tanka girl who has an affair with a Portuguese sailor. In the end, the man returns to his native country and takes their little girl with him, leaving the mother abandoned and broken-hearted. As her sailorman picks up the child, A-Chan's words are: 'Cuidadinho . . . cuidadinho' ('Careful . . . careful'). She resigns herself to her fate, much as she may never have recovered from the blow (1978).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christina Miu Bing Cheng, p. 173: Her slave-like submissiveness is her only attraction to him. A-Chan thus becomes his slave/mistress, an outlet for suppressed sexual urges. The story is an archetypical tragedy of miscegenation. Just as the Tanka community despises A-Chan's cohabitation with a foreign barbarian, Manuel's colleagues mock his 'bad taste' ('gosto degenerado') (Senna Fernandes, 1978: 15) in having a tryst with a boat girl.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christina Miu Bing Cheng, p. 173: As such, the Tanka girl is nonchalantly reified and dehumanized as a thing ( coisa). Manuel reduces human relations to mere consumption not even of her physical beauty (which has been denied in the description of A-Chan), but her 'Orientalness' of being slave-like and submissive.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Christina Miu Bing Cheng, p. 170: We can trace this fleeting and shallow relationship in Henrique de Senna Fernandes' short story, A-Chan, A Tancareira, (Ah Chan, the Tanka Girl) (1978). Senna Fernandes (1923–), a Macanese, had written a series of novels set against the context of Macau and some of which were made into films.&lt;/ref&gt;

As Hong Kong developed, some of the fishing grounds in Hong Kong became badly polluted or were [[Land reclamation in Hong Kong|reclaimed]], and so became land.

Always there is plenty to see, as the Tanka. the people who live in the boats, are full of life. They are an aboriginal tribe, speaking an altogether different language from the Chinese. On the land they are like fish out of water. They are said never to intermarry with landlubbers, but somehow or other their tongue has crept into many villages in the Chiklung section. The Chinese say the Tanka speech sounds like that of the Americans. It seems to have no tones. A hardy race, the Tanka are untouched by the epidemics that visit our coast, perhaps because they live so much off land. Each family has a boat, its own little kingdom, and, there being plenty of fish, all look better fed than most of our land neighbours. Christianity is, with a few rare exceptions, unknown to them. The only window of our Chiklung house gives the missioner a full view of the village life of some of the boat tribe. The window at present is just the absence of the south wall of the little loft to the shop.

The Chinese say the Tanka speech sounds like that of the Americans. It seems to ha.e no tones. A hardy race, the Ta&gt;ii;i are untouched by the epidemics that visit our coast, perhaps because they live so much off land. Each family has a boat, its own little kingdom, and, there being plenty of fish, all look better fed than most of our land neighbours. Christianity is, with a few rare exceptions, unknown to them. The only window of our Chiklung house gives the missioner a full view of the village life of some of the boat tribe. The window at present is just the absence of the south wall of the little loft to the shop. Wooden bars can be inserted in holes against robbers.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before leaving the market, by special invitation we had a swim from off one of the sampans (a term used around Canton: here "baby boat" is the name). The water was almost hot and the current surprisingly swift. Nevertheless the Tanka men and boys go in several times a day, and wash jacket and trousers, undressing and dressing in the water. They seem to let the clothes dry on them.

A report called "Correspondence respecting the alleged existence of Chinese slavery in Hong Kong: presented to both Houses of Parliament by Command of Her Majesty" was presented to the English Parliament in 1882 concerning the existence of slavery in Hong Kong, of which many were Tanka girls serving as prostitutes or mistresses to westerners.

To understand the social bearings of domestic servitude as it obtains in Hong Kong, it must be observed that although the Chinese residents of Hong Kong are under British rule and live in close proximity to English social life, there has always been an impassable gulf between respectable English and Chinese society in Hong Kong. The two forms of social life have exercised a certain influence upon each other, but the result now visible is, that while Chinese social life has remained exactly what it is on the mainland of China, the social life of many foreigners in Hong Kong has comparatively degenerated, and not on'y accommodated itself in certain respects to habits peculiar to the system of •patriarchalism, but caused a certain disrespectable but small class of Chinese to enter into a social alliance with foreigners, which, while detaching them from the restraining influence of the custom and public opinion of Chinese society, left them uninfluenced by the moral powers of foreign civilisation.&lt;ref&gt;Correspondence, p. 54: To understand the social bearings of domestic servitude as it obtains in Hong Kong, it »must be observed that although the Chinese residents of Hong Kong are under British rule and live in close proximity to English social life, there has always been an impassable gulf between respectable English and Chinese society in Hong Kong.

This exceptional class of Chinese residents here in Hong Kong consists principally of the women known in Hong Kong by the popular nickname "ham-shui-mui" (lit. salt water girls), applied to these members of the so-called Tan-ka or boat population, the Pariahs of Cantonese society. These Tan-ka people of the Canton river are the descendants of a tribe of aborigines pushed by advancing Chinese civilisation to live on boats on the Canton river, being for centuries forbidden by law to live on shore. The Emperor Yung Ching (A.D. 1730) allowed them to settle in villages in the immediate proximity of the river, but they were left by him, and remain to the present day excluded from competition for official honours, whilst custom forbids them to intermarry with the rest of the people. These Tan-ka people were the secret but trusty allies of foreigners from the time of the East India Company to the present day. They furnished pilots and supplies of provisions to British men-of-war and troop ships when doing so was by the Chinese Government declared treason, unsparingly visited with capital punishment. They invaded Hong Kong the moment the Colony was opened, and have ever since maintained here a monopoly, so to say, of the supply of Chinese pilots and ship's crews, of the fish trade, the cattle trade, and especially of the trade in women for the supply of foreigners and of brothels patronised by foreigners. Almost every so-called "protected woman," i.e. kept mistress of foreigners here, belongs to this Tan-ka tribe, looked down upon and kept at a distance by all the other Chinese classes. It is among these Tan-ka women, and especially under the protection of those "protected '' T;in-ka women, that private prostitution and the sale of girls for purposes of concubinage flourishes, being looked upon by them as their legitimate profession. Consequently, almost every "protected woman '' keeps a nursery of purchased children or a few servant girls who are being reared with a view to their eventual disposal, according to their personal qualifications, either among foreigners here as kept women, or among Chinese residents as their concubines, or to be sold for export to Singapore, San Francisco, or Australia. Those protected women, moreover, generally act as protectors each to a few other Tanka women who live by sly prostitution. The latter, again, used to be preyed upon—till quite recently His Excellency Governor Hennessy stopped this fiendish practice—by informers paid with Government money, who would first debauch such women and then turn round against them charging them before the magistrate as keepers of unlicensed brothels, in which case a heavy fine would be inflicted, to pay which these women used to sell their own children, or sell themselves into bondage worse than slavery, to the keepers of the brothels licensed hy Government. Whenever a sly brothel was broken up these keepers would crowd the shroffs office of the police court or the visiting room of the Government Lock Hospital to drive their heartless bargains, which were invariably enforced with the weighty support of the Inspectors of brothels appointed by Government under the Contagious Diseases Ordinance. The more this Ordinance was enforced the more of this buying and selling of human flesh went on at the very doors of Government offices.

It is amongst these outcasts of Chinese society that the worst abuses of the Chinese system of domestic servitude exist, because that system is here unrestrained by the powers of traditional custom or popular opinion. This class of people, mustering perhaps here in Hong Kong not more than 2,000 persons, are entirely beyond the argument of this essay. They form a class of their own, readily recognised at a glance. They are disowned by Chinese society, whilst they are but parasites on foreign society.

Ernest John Eitel claimed that all "half caste" people in Hong Kong were descended exclusively from Europeans having relationship with Tanka women, and not Chinese women. The theory that most of the Eurasian mixed race Hong Kong people are descended only from Tanka women and European men, and not ordinary Cantonese women, is backed up by other researchers who pointed out that Tanka women freely consorted with foreigners due to the fact that they were not bound by the same Confucian traditions as the Cantonese, and having a relationship with European men was advantageous for Tanka women. The ordinary Cantonese women did not sleep with European men, the Eurasian population was formed only from Tanka and European admixture.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Meiqi Lee |title=Being Eurasian: memories across racial divides |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mVGd71y1Y-0C&amp;pg=PA262|year=2004 |publisher=Hong Kong University Press |isbn=962-209-671-9 |page=262 |quote=EJ Eitel, in the late 1890s, claims that the 'half-caste population in Hong Kong ' were from the earliest days of the settlement almost exclusively the offspring of liaisons between European men and women of outcaste ethnic groups such as Tanka (Europe in China, 169). Lethbridge refutes the theory saying it was based on a 'myth' propagated by xenophobic Cantonese to account for the establishment of the Hong Kong Eurasian community. Carl Smith's study in the late 1960s on the protected women seems, to some degree, support Eitel's theory. Smith says that the Tankas experienced certain restrictions within the traditional Chinese social structure. Custom precluded their intermarriage with the Cantonese and Hakka-speaking populations. The Tanka women did not have bound feet. Their opportunities for settlement on shore were limited. They were hence not as closely tied to Confucian ethics as other Chinese ethnic groups. Being a group marginal to the traditional Chinese society of the Puntis (Cantonese), they did not have the same social pressure in dealing with Europeans (CT Smith, Chung Chi Bulletin, 27). 'Living under the protection of a foreigner,' says Smith, 'could be a ladder to financial security, if not respectability, for some of the Tanka boat girls' (13 ).}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Maria Jaschok |author2=Suzanne Miers |editor1=Maria Jaschok |editor2=Suzanne Miers |title=Women and Chinese patriarchy: submission, servitude, and escape |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=f5o_t7VxHYAC&amp;pg=PA223|year=1994 |publisher=Zed Books |isbn=1-85649-126-9 |page=223 |quote=He states that they had a near- monopoly of the trade in girls and women, and that: The half-caste population in Hong Kong were, from the earliest days of the settlement of the Colony and down to the present day, almost exclusively the offspring of these Tan-ka people.

The day labourers settled down in huts at Taipingshan, at Saiyingpun and at Tsimshatsui. But the largest proportion of the Chinese population were the so-called Tanka or boat people, the pariahs of South-China, whose intimate connection with the social life of the foreign merchants in the Canton factories used to call forth an annual proclamation on the part of the Cantonese Authorities warning foreigners against the demoralising influences of these people. These Tan-ka people, forbidden by Chinese law (since A.D. 1730) to settle on shore or to compete at literary examinations, and prohibited by custom from intermarrying with the rest of the people, were from the earliest days of the East India Company always the trusty allies of foreigners. They furnished pilots and supplies of provisions to British men-of war, troopships and mercantile vessels, at times when doing so was declared by the Chinese Government to be rank treason, unsparingly visited with capital punishment. They were the hangers-on of the foreign factories of Canton and of the British shipping at Lintin, Kamsingmoon, Tungkin and Hongkong Bay. They invaded Hongkong the moment the settlement was started, living at first on boats in the harbour with their numerous families, and gradually settling on shore. They have maintained ever since almost a monopoly of the supply of pilots and ships' crews, of the fish trade and the cattle trade, but unfortunately also of the trade in girls and women. Strange to say, when the settlement was first started, it was estimated that some 2,000 of these Tan-ka people had flocked to Hongkong, but at the present time they are about the same number, a tendency having set in among them to settle on shore rather than on the water and to disavow their Tan-ka extraction to mix on equal terms with the mass of the Chinese community. The half-caste population in Hongkong were, from the earliest days of the settlement of the Colony and down to the present day, almost exclusively the off-spring of these Tan-ka people. But, like the Tan-ka people themselves, they are happily under the influence of a process of continuous re-absorption in the mass of the Chinese residents of the Colony.&lt;ref&gt;Eitel, p. 169: The day labourers settled down in huts at Taipingshan, at Saiyingpun and at Tsimshatsui.

Our next picture shows a Chinese tanka boat. The tanka boats are counted by thousands in the rivers and bays of China. They are often employed by our national vessels as conveyances to and. from the shore, thereby saving the health of the sailors, who would be otherwise subjected to pulling long distances under a hot sun, with a liability of contracting some fatal disease peculiar to China, and thus introducing infection in a crowded crew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Ballou's monthly magazine, Volume 8|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6BDZAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA514|year=1858|publisher=Thomes &amp; Talbot|page=514|quote=quered, gilded and ornamented. In Simoda, they take the place of horses, the latter being used only under the saddle. The third engraving represents the dinner given on board the Powhatan, in honor of the commissioners appointed by the emperor to conduct negotiations. Commodore Perry invited the officers of the squadron to meet the Japanese officials, of whom there were about seventy. A very excellent dinner was served up, to which the guests did ample justice. Toasts to the emperor and president were drank with all the honors, and the company did not disperse until a very late hour.  Our next picture shows a Chinese tanka boat. The tanka boats are counted by thousands in the rivers and bays of China. They are often employed by our national vessels as conveyances to and. from the shore, thereby saving the health of the sailors, who would be otherwise subjected to pulling long distances under a hot sun, with a liability of contracting some fatal disease peculiar to China, and thus introducing infection in a crowded crew.  On her voyage, the Powhatan touched at Singapore, the capital of a small island at the southern extremity of Malacca. The town stands on a point of land near a bay, affording a safe anchorage at all seasons, and commanding the navigation of the Straits of Malacca. While the Powhatan lay at anchor here, the captain permitted two jugglers to come on board to gratify the wishes of the sailors, by exhibiting their skill in legerdemain, which art they profess in a wonderful degree of perfection. The feat of swallowing a sword was performed, as exhibited in our fifth engraving. But as the weapon belonged to the juggler, the men suspected it was prepared for the purpose, and that the blade consisted of running slides, which, by the pressure of the tongue to the point, would be forced into the hilt. The Malay, however, was determined to confound the doubters, and taking up a piece of rough cast iron from the armorer's forge, swallowed it with as much ease and facility as he did the sword. The performances ended with a lively dance executed by two cobras, to the accompaniment of harsh sounds from a trumpet played by an assistant.  From Singapore lev us pasS to the Sandwich Islands, those gems of the Pacific. The arrival at the Sandwich Islands is always a welcome event in a cruise—the delicious climate, the abundance of fruits, the romantic scenery, the gentle manners of the inhabitants, render this portion of the globe peculiarly attractive. Our sixth engraving represents a group of Sandwich Island girls dancing the hula-hula to the intense delight of a group of Jack tars, who probably experience as much satisfaction at the exhibition, as was ever experienced by the refined Parisians at the efforts of Taglioni, Cerito, or Fanny Ellsler. The hula-hula was formerly a favorite dance among the Sandwich Islands, but has now become nearly extinct through the influence of the missionaries. There are still, however, a few Kanakas, who are addicted to their old amusement. The dance does not admit of much grace, each female going through her gyrations with the mechanical stiffness of an automaton.  The next port we shall touch at, pleading the privilege of a roving commission, is Cape Town,  the capital of the Cape of Good Hope, the wellknown British colony at the Southern extremity of Africa. This point early attracted the attention of the Dutch, who saw that it was of the first importance as a watering-place for their ships. They accordingly established a colony there about the middle of the 17th century. They treated the native inhabitants, the Hottentots, with great severity, driving most of them beyond the mountains, and reducing the remainder to slavery. In 1795, it was captured by the English, but restored by the peace of Amiens, in 1802. In 1806, it was again captured by the English, and has remained in their possession since. It is defended by a castle of considerable strength, and contains many fine public buildings. The harbor is tolerably secure from September to May, during the prevalence of the southeast winds ; but during the rest of the year, when the winds blow from the north and northwest, vessels are obliged to resort to Fulse Bay, on the other side of the peninsula.  Our seventh engraving presents a sketch of a group of marketmen at Cape Town. We here see the native fish dealers and purchasers. A young negro in the foreground is feeding a pelican with a small fish which he has purloined from the bench. The principal market of Cape Town is not very attractive externally, but it is noted for the abundance and excellence of its fish, flesh and fowl, which supply the inhabitants and the ships touching at the port. The sales are conducted much after the manner of this country. The salesmen arc representatives of all quarters of the globe, and include specimens of the native Hottentot and the genuine Yankee, who is always found where money is to be made.  The eighth engraving is a view of the natives and their huts at St. Augustine's Bay, Madagascar. The inhabitants of this remarkably fertile island are composed of two distinct classes—the Arabs, or descendants of foreign colonists, and the Negroes, or original inhabitants of the island. The character of the inhabitants differs much in the different parts of the island, and the accounts of writers vary greatly on this subject. The island is off the eastern coast of Africa, separated from the continent by the Mozambique channel, and is about 900 miles long and 200 broad. Its surface is greatly diversified, and its mountain scenery is exceedingly grand. The name and position of this island was first made known to Europeans by Marco Polo, in the 13th century, though the Arabs had been acquainted with it for several centuries. It was visited by the Portuguese in the beginning of the 16th century. The French made several attempts to found colonies there in the middle of the 17th century, but abandoned them after ineffectual struggles with the natives. In 1745, they renewed their efforts with but little better success. In 1814, it was claimed by England as a dependency of Mauritius, which had been ceded to her by France, and some settlements were established. One of the native kings of the interior, who had shown himself eager to procure a knowledge of European arts for his subjects, consented, in 1820, to relinquish the slave trade on condition that ten Madagassees should be sent to England, and ten to Mauritius, for education. Those sent to England were placed under the care of the}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"Macao.

"We arrived here on the twenty-second, and dispatched a boat to the shore immediately for letters. I received three or four of those fine large letters which are the envy of all who see them, and which are readily distinguishable by their size, and the beautiful style in which they are directed. You cannot imagine the delight with which I devoured their costents. I am glad you wrote so much of our dear pet. 0, my Dita, the longing I feel to take the dear little thing to my heart is agonising! Yesterday I was on shore, and saw a beautiful child of about the same age as ours. I was almost crazy at the sight. Twenty months old! How she must prattle by this time! I fancy I can see her trotting about, following you around the house. What a recompense for the hardest toil of the day would it not be to me, could I only lie down on the floor and have a good romp with her at night!

"And now for Macao, and what I saw, felt, and did. You probably know that a very numerous Chinese population lives entirely in boots; some of them so small that one pities the poor unfortunates who live so miserably. They are born, grow up, marry, and raise children in these boats. You would be astonished to see mothers, with infants at the breast, managing the sails, oars, and rudder of the boat as expertly as any sailor. The Tanka is of very light draft, and, being able to go close in shore, is used to land passengers from the larger boats. As we neared the shore, we noticed small boats pulling toward us from all directions. Soon a boat, "manned" by two really pretty young girls pulling oars, and a third sculling, came alongside, calling out earnestly, 'Takee me boat!' 'Takee me boat!' They had beautiful teeth, white as ivory, brilliant eyes, and their pretty faces, so earnest and pleading, were wreathed in smiles as we gave them the preference over others that joined us from all quarters, clinging to the sides of our large boat, and impeding our headway. The boatmen tried in vain to drive them off. One brute of a fellow splashed repeatedly a poor girl, who. though not at all pretty, had such a depth of meaning and such a sad expression in her eyes and face as charmed me completely. It would have interested any one to hear her scold back, and to see the flashing of her eyes, and the vivid expression in every feature. When I frowned at our sailor, the sudden change in her face from anger to smiles, the earnest 'takee me boat,' as she caught evidence of sympathy from me, was beautiful. We were assailed with these cries from so many, and there was such a clamour, that, in self-defense, we had to choose a boat and go. The first-mentioned girls, on account of their beauty, won the majority, and their boat was clean and well furnished, which is more than could be said of many of them. I caught the look of disappointment which passed over the features of the girl I have described, and it haunts me even now. Trifling as it, appeared to us, such scenes constitute the great events in their poor lives, and such triumphs or defeats are all-important to them.

"Upon entering the Tanka boat, we found the mother of the young girls, and a young infant dressed heroically. The infant was the child of the prettiest one of the girls, whose husband was away fishing. The old woman was quite talkative, and undoubtedly gave us lots of news!

"They had a miniature temple on the bows of the boat, with Joss seated cross-legged, looking very fat, and very red, and very stupid. Before him was an offering of two apricots, but Joss never deigned to look at it, and apparently had no appetite. I felt a sincere respect, however, for the devotional feeling of these poor idolaters, recognising even there the universal instinct which teaches that there is a God.

"I called upon the commodore, who received me with great courtesy, and gave me a very interesting account of the voyage out, by the way of Mauritius, of the Susquehanna, to which I was first appointed. She has gone on to Amoy.

"I made the acquaintance of a Portuguese family, named Lurero. The young ladies are quite accomplished, speaking French, Spanish, and Italian, but no English. They came down to receive the visit of our consul and lady, who called while I was there. Mr. Lurero gave me some specimens of a soap-fruit, and showed me the tree. The fruit is an exceedingly fine soap, which, without any preparation, is used for washing the finest goods.

"We expect to hear of the sailing of the 'Japan Expedition' by the next mail. When Commodore Perry arrives, we shall be kept so busy that time will fly rapidly, and we shall soon be looking forward to our return home, unless Japan disturbances (which are not seriously anticipated) delay us.

"I did not tell you of my visit to 'Camoens' Cave,' the principal attraction of Macao. This 'cave' was the resort of the distinguished Portuguese poet Camoens, who there wrote the greater part of the ' Lusiad.' The cave is situated in the midst of the finest wooded walks I ever saw. The grounds are planted beautifully, and immense vases of flowers stand around. The grounds are not level, but lie up the side of a slope or hill, irregular in shape, and precipitous on one side. There are several fine views, particularly that of the harbor and surrounding islands."

I will here reproduce the following additional items regarding Camoens, from the pen of Walter A. Hose: —

"Macao had a particular interest for me as the first foothold that modern civilisation obtained upon the ancient shores of 'far Cathay,' and as the birthplace of one of the finest epic poems ever written. ... On one of those calm and beautiful nights peculiar to sub-tropical climes, I stood alone upon the white sea-wall, and no sound fell upon my ears save the whirring monotone of insects in the trees above the hills, the periodical chime of bells from anchored ships, and the low, sweet cadence of the incoming tide.

==Surnames==
The [[Fuzhou Tanka]] have different surnames than the Tanka of Guangdong.&lt;ref&gt;Hansson, p. 117: Unless a change of surnames occurred for some unknown reason, or unless the ' water names' are not the real names of the Fujian boat people, it would seem that the Dan people lacked Chinese-style surnames at the time the Fujian branch&lt;/ref&gt; Qing records indicate that "Weng, Ou, Chi, Pu, Jiang, and Hai" (翁, 歐, 池, 浦, 江) were surnames of the [[Fuzhou Tanka]].&lt;ref&gt;Hansson, p. 116: In a late Qing dynasty work which has a section on boat people that mainly refers to those in Fujian, common surnames are said to be Weng 翁 ('old fisherman'), Ou 歐, Chi 池 (pond), Pu 浦 (river bank), Jiang 江 (river) and Hai 海 (sea). None of those surnames is a very common one in China and a few are very rare.&lt;/ref&gt; Qing records also stated that Tanka surnames in Guangdong consisted of "Mai, Pu, Wu, Su, and He" (麥, 濮, 吴, 蘇, 何), alternatively some people claimed Gu and Zeng as Tanka surnames.&lt;ref&gt;Hansson, p. 116: Some of them list the five names Mai 麥, Pu 濮, Wu 吴, Su 蘇 and He 何 The Huizhou prefectural gazetteer even states that there are no other boat people surnames, while others also add Gu 顧 and Zeng 曾 to make seven&lt;/ref&gt;

==DNA tests and disease==
Tests on the DNA of the Tanka people found that the disease [[Thalassemia]] was common among the Tanka. Tests also stated that the ancestors of the Tanka were not Han Chinese, but were native people.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0035920371901854?via=ihub | doi=10.1016/0035-9203(71)90185-4 | volume=65 | title=Cooley's anaemia among the tanka of South China | year=1971 | journal=Transactions of the Royal Society of Tropical Medicine and Hygiene | pages=59–62 | author=McFadzean A.J.S., Todd D.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tropicalmedandhygienejrnl.net/article/0035-9203(71)90185-4/abstract Cooley's anaemia among the tanka of South China, A.J.S.Â McFadzean, D.Â Todd]{{Dead link|date=June 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=no }}.

The Tanka suffer from [[lung cancer]] more than the Cantonese and [[Teochew people|Teochew]]. The frequency of the disease is higher among Tanka. The rate among the Teochew is lower than that of the Cantonese.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Asiaweek, Volume 15 |url=https://books.google.com/books?ei=VHG1TrSpCKb10gGFi_HRBw&amp;ct=result&amp;id=dIIMAQAAMAAJ|year=1989 |publisher=Asiaweek Ltd. |page=90 |quote=Koo has found too that cancer rates differ among Hongkong's Chinese communities.

'''Thoranam''' ({{lang-ta|தோரணம்}} [[IAST]] {{IAST|'''Tōraṇam'''}}) are hanging decorations in [[Tamil Nadu]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.oocities.org/rmayooranathan/decoration_concept.html&lt;/ref&gt; Rooted in [[Tamil culture]]&lt;ref&gt;http://flickrhivemind.net/Tags/chennai,thoranam/Interesting&lt;/ref&gt; it got a history way back to the [[Sangam period]]. The main purpose it was used on those days, since no printed invitations, to differentiate whether it is a happy occasion or mourning for the people who visit that place. It is made up of tender coconut leaf blades and has two types.

Thoranam in a song sung by 8th century [[Andal]] pasuram, [[Nachiar Tirumozhi]] of ''[[Divya Prabandha]]''&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tamilvu.org/tdb/titles_cont/music/html/naachiyar.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://dravidaveda.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=844&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Tamil language|Tamil]] literature

Meaning : ''I had a dream O friend! The town was decked with festoons and golden urns. Surrounded by a thousand caparisoned elephants our Kannan came towards me ( to marry )''

[[File:Thoranam.jpg|thumb|Mangala Thoranam (Auspicious)]]

* Mangala Thoranam - Auspicious are used during festival season and happy occasions in houses and temples.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.straitstimes.com/breaking-news/singapore/story/hindu-temples-decoration-sets-new-singapore-record-20131006&lt;/ref&gt; Thoranam has a bird like design and got four or five them which faces upward direction.

[[File:Thoranam3.jpg|thumb|Amangala Thoranam (Inauspicious)]]

* Amangala Thoranam - Inauspicious are used at mourning places. It has three birds which faces downwards.

Another thoranam is ''Maavilai Thoranam'' made up of mango tree leaves which will be tied up on the main door of a temple or house for auspicious. Mango leaves are good disinfectant which helps when there is a gathering of people for festivals are good occasions.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.thiruvenkadumandaitivu.com/2013/09/blog-post_13.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Veppilai thoranam is made up of Neem leaves where veepam (neem) + ilai(leaf) = veppilai.

The '''Togutil''' people (also known as '''Inner Tobelo''', a term referring to the isolated people of Halmahera who live in the woods and "can sleep standing up under a leaf during rain"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thejakartaglobe.com/archive/a-public-works-project-threatens-rice-harvest-in-remote-indonesia/ |title=A Public Works Project Threatens Rice Harvest in Remote Indonesia |publisher=The Jakarta Globe |date=2012-04-22 |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;) are an indigenous group with a semi-nomadic lifestyle living in the jungles of [[Totodoku]], [[Tukur-Tukur]], [[Lolobata]], [[Kobekulo]] and [[Buli, North Maluku]] in the [[Aketajawe-Lolobata National Park]], [[North Halmahera Regency]], [[North Maluku]], [[Indonesia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Central PKMST Project (Indonesia)|title=Isolated Community Development: Data &amp; Information|year=1994|publisher=Directorate of Isolated Community Development, Directorate General of Social Welfare Development, Department of Social Affairs, Central PKSMT Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The external ethnonym ''Togutil'' is equivalent to the native designations ''o fongana ma nyawa'' and ''o hongana ma nyawa'' (literally "the forest people").&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.497.215&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|title=Social Change and the Reformulation of Identity Among the Forest Tobelo of Halmahera Tengah|page=3-4|accessdate=2018-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.liputan6.com/read/328947/suku-togutil-di-rimba-halmahera |title=Suku Togutil di Rimba Halmahera |publisher=Liputan6 |date=2011-04-11 |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their lifestyle is very much dependent on the surroundings of the jungle. Sago is a staple food.

Their settlements are usually in groups of community along river banks. There are about 42 households of Togutil communities that settled along the [[Dodaga river]], while about 500  lived along the Akelamo river.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=International Council for Bird Preservation, BirdLife International|title=World Birdwatch, Volumes 18-21|year=1996|publisher=International Council For Bird Presentation}}&lt;/ref&gt; Their houses are made of wood and bamboo with ''Pelem'' leaves (a type of [[Livistonia]]) as roofing. Generally their houses do not have walls or wooden flooring.

The Togutils are categorized as separate group of people living in the interiors of north and central [[Halmahera]]. The Togutil people use the same language as the [[Tobelo people]] that live in the coastal area. Their communities are often categorized as a group of outcasts living in the jungles compared to the Tobelo living in the coastal area. Their physical appearance, especially their facial features and skin tone have a stronger resemblance to the [[Malay people]] than of the Tobelo.&lt;ref name="TSATMQ"&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Spencer Sochaczewski|title=The Sultan and the Mermaid Queen: Surprising Asian People, Places and Things that Go Bump in the Night|year=2009|publisher=Editions Didier Millet|isbn=981-4217-74-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to legend, they are actually coastal dwellers who moved to the jungles in order to avoid taxes. In 1915 during rule of the [[Dutch East Indies]], there was an effort to settle them in the countryside of Kusuri and Tobelamo. But because they refused to pay taxes, they returned to the jungles and the settlement effort became a failure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mirror.unpad.ac.id/koran/mediaindonesia/2011-10-23/mediaindonesia_2011-10-23_024.pdf |title=Relokasi Suku Togutil |author=Panca Syurkani |publisher=Media Indonesia |date=2011-10-23 |accessdate=2015-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Lifestyle==
The Togutil have a very laid back lifestyle.&lt;ref name="TSATMQ"/&gt; Some of them still wear [[loincloth]]es, although most of them have adopted modern clothing. Apart from farming they lived on sago, pigs, and fish from the rivers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Paul Spencer Sochaczewski|title=An Inordinate Fondness for Beetles|year=2012|publisher=Editions Didier Millet|isbn=981-4385-20-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; They also harvest [[Megapode]] eggs, resins, and antler horns to be sold to people from the coastal area. Bananas, cassava, sweet potatoes, papayas and sugar cane are common crops that can be found in their gardens. However, because of their semi-nomadic lifestyle, it is presumed that the farms are not cultivated intensively. Therefore, as it is common in areas where there are primitive tribes, jungles in this region do not show any significant disruption.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.halmaherautara.com/artikel.php?id=61&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4654">'''Tyra Hunter''' (1970 &amp;ndash; August 7, 1995) was an African-American [[trans woman|transgender woman]] who died after being injured as a passenger in a [[car accident]] and being refused emergency medical care.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=HBRR1isU-VAC|title=The Transgender Studies Reader|authors= [[Susan Stryker]], [[Stephen Whittle]]|publisher=CRC Press|year=2006|ISBN=9780415947091|accessdate=2009-11-24}}{{Page needed|date=November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://transgriot.blogspot.com/2007/08/trya-hunter-anniversary.html|title=Anniversary of Tyra Hunter's Death|accessdate=2009-11-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Emergency medical technician]]s at the scene of the accident uttered derogatory epithets and withdrew medical care after cutting open Tyra's pants and
discovering that she had a penis,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.qrd.org/qrd/trans/1995/tyra.hunter.case.reopened-12.04.95|title=Tyra Hunter Case Reopened 12-04-1995|accessdate=2016-09-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Emergency room|ER]] staff at [[DC General Hospital]] subsequently provided dilatory and inadequate care.

On December 11, 1998, a jury awarded Hunter's mother, Margie, $2.9 million after finding the District of Columbia, through its employees in the D.C. Fire Department and doctors at D.C. General, liable under the D.C. Human Rights Act and for negligence and medical malpractice for causing Tyra's death. While $600,000 of the amount was awarded for damages attributable to violations of the D.C. Human Rights Act associated with the withdrawal of medical care at the accident scene and openly denigrating Tyra with epithets, a further $1.5 million was awarded to her mother for Tyra's conscious pain and suffering and for economic loss from the wrongful death medical malpractice claim.  Doctors at D.C. General failed to diagnose and treat Tyra who died of internal bleeding in the hospital emergency room.  Evidence at the trial demonstrated that had Tyra been provided with a blood transfusion and referred to a surgeon, she would have had an 86% chance of surviving.

The case against the District of Columbia was tried by Richard F. Silber. Dana Priesing, an observer at the trial, wrote that the evidence supported "the inference that a stereotype (namely that Tyra was an anonymous, drug using, [[transgender]] street person) affected the treatment Tyra received," and that the "ER staff, as evidenced by their actions, did not consider her life worth saving." The trial itself included a great deal of "unlikely testimony and missing evidence."&lt;ref name="gendercentre"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gendercentre.org.au/resources/polare-archive/archived-articles/damages-awarded-after-transsexual-womans-death.htm|title=Damages Awarded after Transsexual Woman's Death|accessdate=2014-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adrian Williams, one of the EMTs who had neglected to treat Hunter, testified that he assumed she was a man on sight, "failing to notice that she had breasts, make-up, women's clothing, a woman's hairstyle, and white nail polish."&lt;ref name="gendercentre"/&gt; One D.C. General employee, after being subpoenaed, left for Africa and did not return until late December 1998. In the end, none of the EMTs involved were ever disciplined.

Tyra had transitioned at the age of 14 and lived entirely as a woman. Over 2,000 people attended her funeral.

T.Y.R.A. (Transgender Youth Resources and Advocacy), a program of the Illinois Gender Advocates and [[Howard Brown Health Center]], is a [[Chicago]] area transgender youth initiative named in the memory of Tyra Hunter.

The status of '''women in Pakistan''' is one of systemic [[gender subordination]] even though it varies considerably across classes, regions, and the rural/urban divide due to uneven socioeconomic development and the impact of tribal, feudal, and capitalist social formations on women's lives. The Pakistani women of today do, however,  enjoy a better status than in the past.{{vague|date=October 2018}}&lt;ref name="adb_wom_pak"&gt;{{cite book

Almost all religious groups often quote the Quran and advocate subordination of women in Pakistan.

Even with these improvements, rampant domestic abuse and a high rate of [[child marriage]]s and [[forced marriage]]s still remain.

[[Pakistan]] has a dual system of civil and [[sharia]] law. The [[Constitution of Pakistan]] recognizes equality between men and women (Art. 25(2) states "There shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex") but also recognizes as valid [[Sharia law]] (Chapter 3A. – [[Federal Shariat Court]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.na.gov.pk/publications/constitution.pdf|title=The Constitution of the Islamic Republic of Pakistan|publisher=National Assembly of Pakistan|date=April 20, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Fatima jinnah1.jpg|thumb|[[Fatima Jinnah]] (1893–1967) was a Pakistani dental surgeon, biographer, stateswoman and one of the leading founders of Pakistan]]
&lt;!-- ancient, medieval, British --&gt;
Historically, Muslim reformers such as [[Syed Ahmad Khan]] tried to bring education to women, limit [[polygamy]], and empower women in other ways through education.&lt;ref name="whistory"/&gt; The founder of Pakistan, [[Muhammad Ali Jinnah]], was known to have a positive attitude towards women.&lt;ref name="whistory"/&gt; After the independence of Pakistan, women's groups and feminist organisations started by prominent leaders like Mohtarma [[Fatima Jinnah]] started to form that worked to eliminate socio-economic injustices against women in the country.

Jinnah points out that Muslim women leaders from all classes actively supported the Pakistan movement in the mid-1940s. Their movement was led by wives and other relatives of leading politicians. Women were sometimes organised into large-scale public demonstrations. Before 1947 there was a tendency for the Muslim women in Punjab to vote for the Muslim League while their menfolk supported the Unionist Party.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Azra Asghar Ali|title=Indian Muslim Women's Suffrage Campaign: Personal Dilemma and Communal Identity 1919–47|journal=Journal of the Pakistan Historical Society\date=April 1999|volume=47|issue=2|pp=33–46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Many Muslim women supported the [[Indian National Congress]] [[Quit India Movement]]. Some like [[Syeda Safia Begum]] of [[Muslim Town, Lahore|Muslim Town]] [[Lahore]] started the first [[English School for Muslim Children]] in Muslim Town in 1935.
Pakistani women were granted the [[women's suffrage|suffrage]] in 1947,&lt;ref name="woman_suffrage_timeline"&gt;{{cite web

Had [[Ayub Khan (Field Marshal)|General Ayub Khan]] run fair elections, Ms. [[Fatima Jinnah]] of Pakistan would have become the first Muslim President of the largest Muslim country in the world. However, despite that setback, during 1950–60, several pro-women initiatives were taken.

===Zulfikar Ali Bhutto Government===
The regime of [[Zulfikar Ali Bhutto]] (1970–1977) was a period of liberal attitudes towards women. All government services were opened to women including the district management group and the foreign service (in the civil service), which had been denied to them earlier. About 10% of the seats in the [[National Assembly of Pakistan|National Assembly]] and 5% in the provincial assemblies were reserved for women, with no restriction on contesting general seats as well. However, the implementation of these policies was poor as the Government faced a financial crisis due to the [[Indo-Pakistani War of 1971|war with India]] and consequent split of the country.&lt;ref name="adb_wom_pak"/&gt;

Gender equality was specifically guaranteed in the [[Constitution of Pakistan#The Constitution of 1973|Constitution of Pakistan]] adopted in 1973. The constitution stipulates that "there shall be no discrimination on the basis of sex alone." The Constitution additionally affords the protection of marriage, family, the mother and the child as well as ensuring "full participation of women in all spheres of national life.".&lt;ref&gt;Constitution of Pakistan Articles 25, 27, 32, 34 and 35.&lt;/ref&gt; However, many judges upheld the "laws of Islam", often misinterpreted, over the Constitution's guarantee of non-discrimination and equality under the law.&lt;ref name="alice_violence"&gt;{{cite web

In 1975, an official delegation from Pakistan participated in the First World Conference on Women in [[Mexico]], which led to the constitution of the first Pakistan Women's Rights Committee.

===Zia-ul-Haq's Military Regime===
{{main article|Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization}}

General [[Zia ul-Haq]], then Army Chief of Staff, overthrew the democratically elected Zulfikar Ali Bhutto government in a military coup on 5 July 1977. The Sixth Plan during the martial law régime of General Zia-ul-Haq (1977–1986) was full of policy contradictions. The régime took many steps toward institutional building for women's development, such as the establishment of the [[Women's Division]] in the Cabinet Secretariat, and the appointment of another commission on the Status of Women. A chapter on [[women in development]] was included for the first time in the Sixth Plan. The chapter was prepared by a working group of 28 professional women headed by [[Syeda Abida Hussain]], chairperson of the [[Jhang District]] council at that time. The main objective as stated in the Sixth Plan was "to adopt an integrated approach to improve women's status".&lt;ref name="adb_wom_pak"/&gt; In 1981, General Zia-ul-Haq nominated the ''[[Majlis-e-Shoora]]'' (Federal Advisory Council) and inducted 20 women as members, however Majlis-e-Shoora had no power over the executive branch.&lt;ref&gt;F. Shaheed, K. Mumtaz. et al. 1998. "Women in Politics: Participation and Representation in Pakistan". Shirkat Gah, Pakistan.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, the National Assembly elected through nonparty elections doubled women's reserved quota (20 percent).

However, Zia-ul-Haq initiated [[Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization|a process of Islamization]] by introducing discriminatory legislation against women such as the set of [[Hudood Ordinance]]s and the ''Qanun-e-Shahadat'' Order (Law of Evidence Order). He banned women from participating and from being spectators of sports and promoted [[purdah]].&lt;ref name="adb_wom_pak"/&gt; He suspended all fundamental rights guaranteed in the Constitution that had been adopted in 1973, including the right to be free of discrimination on the basis of sex. He also proposed laws regarding [[Qisas]] and [[Diyat]], Islamic penal laws governing retribution (''qisas'') and compensation (''diyat'') in crimes involving bodily injury. When the victim was a woman, the amount of ''diyat'' was halved&lt;ref&gt;Asma Jahangir, "A Pound of Flesh," Newsline (Karachi), December 1990, pp. 61–62.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ordinance, 1979 was a subcategory of the [[Hudood Ordinance]]. ''[[Zina (Arabic)|Zina]]'' is the crime of non-marital sexual relations and adultery. The Zina Ordinance included ''zina-bil-jabr'', the category of forced intercourse. If the woman who accuses a man of ''zina-bil-jabr'' (rape) cannot prove to the judicial system that she was raped, she faces adultery charges.&lt;ref name="csid6_julie"&gt;[http://www.islam-democracy.org/documents/pdf/6th_Annual_Conference-JulieNorman.pdf Rape Law in Islamic Societies: Theory, Application and the Potential for Reform] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070616161350/http://www.islam-democracy.org/documents/pdf/6th_Annual_Conference-JulieNorman.pdf |date=16 June 2007 }}. Julie Norman. "Democracy and Development: Challenges for the Islamic World", CSID Sixth Annual Conference, Washington, DC – 22–23 April 2005&lt;/ref&gt; In order for a rapist to receive "hadd," the maximum punishment provided for under the [[Quran]], either the rapist must confess to the rape, or four pious adult Muslim men must witness the "act of penetration" itself and testify against the rapist.&lt;ref&gt;Offence of Zina (Enforcement of Hudood) Ord., 1979, Section 8.&lt;/ref&gt; 

Under ''Qanun-e-Shahadat'', a woman's testimony was not weighed equally to that of a man.&lt;ref&gt;Qanun-e-Shahadat Order of 1984 (Law of Evidence), Article 17&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, if a woman does not have male witnesses but does have female witnesses, their testimony would not satisfy the evidence requirement. The perpetrator may be acquitted and the victim may face adultery charges. The threat of being prosecuted discourages victims from filing complaints.

In addition, the legal possibility of marital rape was eliminated; by definition, rape became an extramarital offence according to the Zina ordinance. The ordinance prompted international criticism. [[Women's rights]] groups helped in the production of a film titled "Who will cast the first stone?" filmmaker by Sabiha Sumar to highlight the oppression and sufferings of women under the Hudood Ordinances.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newsline.com.pk/NewsSep2005/interviewsep2005.htm|title=I've had no support from Pakistanis at home|author=Sairah Irshad Khan|work=Newsline|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20051025102228/http://www.newsline.com.pk/NewsSep2005/interviewsep2005.htm|archivedate=25 October 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In September 1981, the first conviction and sentence under the Zina Ordinance, of [[rajm|stoning to death]] for Fehmida and Allah Bakhsh were set aside under national and international pressure. In September 1981, women came together in [[Karachi]] in an emergency meeting to oppose the adverse effects on women of martial law and the Islamization campaign. They launched what later became the first full-fledged national women's movement in Pakistan, the [[Women’s Action Forum]] (WAF). WAF staged public protests and campaigns against the Hudood Ordinances, the Law of Evidence, and the Qisas and Diyat laws (temporarily shelved as a result).&lt;ref name="crime_or_custom"&gt;{{cite web

In 1983, an orphaned, thirteen-year-old girl Jehan Mina was allegedly raped by her uncle and his sons, and became pregnant. She was unable to provide enough evidence that she was raped. She was charged with [[adultery]] and the court considered her pregnancy as the proof of adultery. She was awarded the ''[[Tazir]]'' punishment of one hundred [[flagellation|lashes]] and three years of rigorous imprisonment.&lt;ref name="shahnaz_mediating"&gt;[http://www.crvawc.ca/docs/pub_khan2001.pdf Mediating The Hadood Laws In Pakistan] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128175557/http://www.crvawc.ca/docs/pub_khan2001.pdf |date=28 November 2006 }}.

In 1983, [[Safia Bibi]], a nearly blind teenaged domestic servant was allegedly raped by her employer and his son. Due to lack of evidence, she was convicted for adultery under the Zina ordinance, while the rapists were acquitted. She was sentenced to fifteen lashes, five years imprisonment, and a fine of 1000 rupees. The decision attracted so much publicity and condemnation from the public and the press that the Federal [[Shariah]] Court of its own motion, called for the records of the case and ordered that she should be released from prison on her own bond. Subsequently, on appeal, the finding of the trial court was reversed and the conviction was set aside.&lt;ref name="asifa_her_honor"&gt;{{cite web|title=Her Honor:An Islamic Critique of the Rape Laws of Pakistan from a Woman-sensitive Perspective|url=http://www.law.wisc.edu/facstaff/download.php?iID=175 |author=Asifa Quraishi|journal=Michigan Journal of International Law|volume=18|number=2|date=Winter 1997|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060901152331/http://www.law.wisc.edu/facstaff/download.php?iID=175|archivedate=1 September 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[International Commission of Jurists]] mission to Pakistan in December 1986 called for repealing of certain sections of the Hudood Ordinances relating to crimes and so-called "Islamic" punishments which discriminate against women and non-Muslims.

There is considerable evidence that legislation during this period has negatively impacted Pakistani women's lives and made them more vulnerable to extreme violence. Majority of women in prison were charged under the Hudood Ordinance. Similarly, a national level study conducted in ''dar-ul-aman''s (shelters for women) mentioned that 21% of women had Hudood cases against them.&lt;ref&gt;Farzana Bari (1998), Voices of Resistance: The Status of Shelters for Women in Pakistan, Islamabad, p.26.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a 1998 report by [[Amnesty International]], more than one-third of all Pakistani women in prison were being held due to having been accused or found guilty of zina.&lt;ref name="amnesty_noprogress"&gt;{{cite web

===Benazir Bhutto Government===
[[File:Benazir bhutto 1988.jpg|thumb|[[Benazir Bhutto]] became the first woman elected to lead a Muslim state. [[Assassination of Benazir Bhutto|She was assassinated]] while campaigning for the [[Pakistani general election, 2008|Pakistani general election of 2008]].]]

After Zia-ul-Haq's regime, there was a visible change in the policy context in favour of women. The Seventh, Eighth, and Ninth plans formulated under various democratically elected governments have clearly made efforts to include women's concerns in the planning process. However, planned development failed to address gender inequalities due to the gap between policy intent and implementation.&lt;ref name="adb_wom_pak"/&gt;

In 1988, [[Benazir Bhutto]] (Zulfikar Ali Bhutto's daughter) became the first female [[Prime Minister of Pakistan]], and the first woman elected to head a Muslim country.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; During her election campaigns, she voiced concerns over social issues of women, health and discrimination against women. She also announced plans to set up [[women's police station]]s, courts and women's development banks. She also promised to repeal controversial Hudood laws that curtailed the rights of women However, during her two incomplete terms in office (1988–90 and 1993–96), Benazir Bhutto did not propose any legislation to improve welfare services for women. She was not able to repeal a single one of Zia-ul-Haq's Islamisation laws. By virtue of the eighth constitutional amendment imposed by Zia-ul-Haq, these laws were protected both from ordinary legislative modification and from judicial review.&lt;ref name="crime_or_custom"/&gt;

In early 1988, the case of Shahida Parveen and Muhammad Sarwar sparked bitter public criticism. Shahida's first husband, Khushi Muhammad, had divorced her and the papers had been signed in front of a magistrate. The husband however, had not registered the divorce documents in the local council as required by law, rendering the divorce not legally binding. Unaware of this, Shahida, after her mandatory 96-day period of waiting (''iddat''), remarried. Her first husband, rebounding from a failed attempt at a second marriage, decided he wanted his first wife Shahida back. Shahida's second marriage was ruled invalid. She and her second husband, Sarwar were charged with adultery. They were sentenced to death by stoning.&lt;ref name="shahnaz_mediating"/&gt; The public criticism led to their retrial and acquittal by the Federal Shariah Court.

Ministry of Women's Development (MWD) established Women's Studies centres at five universities in [[Islamabad]], [[Karachi]], [[Quetta]], [[Peshawar]], and [[Lahore]] in 1989. However, four of these centres became almost non-functional due to lack of financial and administrative support.&lt;ref name="adb_wom_pak"/&gt; Only the center at [[University of Karachi]] (funded by the [[Canadian International Development Agency]]) was able to run a master of arts programme.

The [[First Women Bank]] Ltd. (FWBL) was established in 1989 to address women's financial needs. FWBL, a nationalised commercial bank, was given the rôle of a development finance institution, as well as of a social welfare organisation. It operates 38 real-time online branches across the country, managed and run by women. MWD provided a credit line of Rs 48 million to FWBL to finance small-scale credit schemes for disadvantaged women. The Social Action Programme launched in 1992/93 aimed at reducing gender disparities by improving women's access to social services.

Pakistan acceded to the [[Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women]] (CEDAW) on 29 February 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

However MWD faced a lack of resources initially.&lt;ref name="adb_wom_pak"/&gt; Pakistan failed to submit its initial report that was due in 1997.&lt;ref&gt;Report by the Committee on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination Against Women, 1 May 2000, U.N. doc. CEDAW/C/2000/II/1.&lt;/ref&gt; Pakistan neither signed nor ratified the Optional Protocol of the Women's Convention, which has led to non-availability of avenues for filing grievances by individuals or groups against Pakistan under CEDAW.&lt;ref name="alice_violence"/&gt;

===Nawaz Sharif Government===
In 1997, [[Nawaz Sharif]] was elected as the Prime Minister. He had also held office for a truncated term (1990–1993), during which he had promised to adopt Islamic law as the supreme law of Pakistan.

In 1997, the Nawaz Sharif government formally enacted the Qisas and Diyat Ordinance, which institutes [[shariah]]-based changes in Pakistan's criminal law. The ordinance had earlier been kept in force by invoking the president's power to re-issue it every four months.&lt;ref name="crime_or_custom"/&gt;

Sharif then proposed a fifteenth amendment to the Constitution that would entirely replace the existing legal system with a comprehensive Islamic one and would override the "constitution and any law or judgment of any court.".&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "Pakistan Proposes New Islamic Laws," 28 August 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; The proposal was approved in the National Assembly (lower house), where Sharif's party has a commanding majority, but, it remained stalled in the Senate after facing strong opposition from women's groups, human rights activists, and opposition political parties.&lt;ref&gt;Associated Press, "Pakistan Moves Closer to Islamic Rule," 9 October 1998.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 1997 ruling by the [[Lahore High Court]], in the highly publicised Saima Waheed case, upheld a woman's right to marry freely but called for amendments to the 1965 Family Laws, on the basis of Islamic norms, to enforce parental authority to discourage "love marriages".&lt;ref name="crime_or_custom"/&gt;

The report of the Inquiry of the Commission for Women (1997) clearly stated that the Hudood legislation must be repealed as it discriminates against women and is in conflict with their fundamental rights. A similar commission during Benazir Bhutto's administration had also recommended amending certain aspects of Hudood Ordinance. However, neither Benazir Bhutto nor Nawaz Sharif implemented these recommendations.

The enhancement of women's status was stated as one of the 16 goals listed in the ''Pakistan 2010 Program'' (1997), a critical policy document. However, the document omits women while listing 21 major areas of interests. Similarly, another major policy document, the "Human Development and Poverty Reduction Strategy" (1999), mentioned women as a target group for poverty reduction but lacks gender framework.

The country's first all-women university, named after [[Fatima Jinnah]], was inaugurated on 6 August 1998. It suffered from delays in the release of development funds from the Federal Government.&lt;ref name="adb_wom_pak"/&gt;

===Pervez Musharraf's régime===

In 2000, the [[Church of Pakistan]] ordained its first women [[deacon]]s.&lt;ref name="women_as_clergy"&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002 (and later during court trials in 2005), the case of [[Mukhtaran Mai]] brought the plight of rape victims in Pakistan under an international spotlight. On 2 September 2004, the Ministry of Women Development was made an independent ministry, separating from the Social Welfare and Education Ministry.

In July 2006, General [[Pervez Musharraf]] asked his Government to begin work on amendments to the controversial 1979 Hudood Ordinance introduced under Zia-ul-Haq's régime.&lt;ref name="hindu_Musharraf_wants"&gt;{{cite news

====Legislation for protection of women====
On 29 January 2010 the President signed the 'Protection against Harassment of Women at Workplace Bill 2009' which the [[Parliament of Pakistan|parliament]] adopted on 21 January 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/04-zardari-signs-women-prot-bill-qs-08 | title=Women's bill sets tough penalties | work=Dawn.com | date=30 January 2010 | accessdate=5 July 2016 | author=Shamim-ur-Rahman | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100131230825/http://www.dawn.com/wps/wcm/connect/dawn-content-library/dawn/news/pakistan/04-zardari-signs-women-prot-bill-qs-08 | archivedate=31 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two additional bills were signed into law by the President in December 2012 criminalising the primitive practices of Vani, watta-satta, swara and marriage to the Quran which used women as tradable commodoties for settlement of disputes. In addition the punishment for acid throwing to life imprisonment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.pakistantoday.com.pk/2011/12/23/national/president-signs-two-women%E2%80%99s-rights-bills-into-law/ | title=President signs two women's rights bills into law | work=Pakistan Today | date=23 December 2011 | accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The government further established special task force in the interior [[Sindh]] region to for action against the practice of [[Karo-Kari]] establishing helplines and offices in the districts of [[Sukkur]], [[Jacobabad]], [[Larkana]] and [[Khairpur District|Khairpur]].

In 2012 the government revived the National Commission on Status of Women established by General Musharraf for three years in 2000, later being revived for three years at a time. The bill moved by government established the commission as a permanent body with the task to ensure the implementation of women protection legislation and abuses against women.

==Practices==

===Purdah===

Now, many women in Pakistan don't wear Purdah, which is opposed by many religious scholars. Generally, women living in more developed areas like Lahore, Karachi and Islamabad are more liberal in terms of dressing than women living in less developed areas.

===Child marriage (vani)===
Although the Child Marriages Restraint Act makes it illegal for girls under the age of 16 to be married, instances of child marriages are commonly found in rural areas. [[Vani (custom)|Vani]] is a [[child marriage]] custom followed in tribal areas and the Punjab province. The young girls are forcibly married off in order to resolve the feuds between different clans;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

|work=BBC News | date=5 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swara (custom)|Swara]], [[Pait likkhi]] and [[Addo Baddo]] are similar tribal and rural customs that often promote marriage of girls in their early teenage years. In one extreme case in 2012, a local [[Jirga]] in Aari village, [[Swat District|Swat]] ordered that Roza Bibi, a girl of six, must be married off to settle a dispute between her family and the rival family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Swat Jirga Forces Family To Marry Off 6-Year-Old Girl To Settle Feud|url=http://www.rferl.org/content/pakistan-swat-jirga-marry-off-6-year-old-girl-feud/24764045.html|accessdate=8 November 2012|newspaper=Radio Free Europe Radio Liberty|date=7 Nov 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;. As of 2018, the trend of Vani is decreased very much, allowing more young girls to live their childhood freely.

===Watta satta===
[[Watta satta]] is a tribal custom in which brides are traded between two clans. In order to marry off a son, one must also have a daughter to marry off in return. If there is no sister to exchange in return for a son's spouse, a cousin, or a distant relative can also do. Even though Islamic law requires that both partners explicitly consent to marriage, women are often forced into marriages arranged by their fathers or tribal leaders.&lt;ref name="alice_violence"/&gt; Watta satta is most common in rural parts of northwest and west Pakistan, and its tribal regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://openknowledge.worldbank.org/handle/10986/5877|title=Watta Satta: Bride Exchange and Women's Welfare in Rural Pakistan|work=Open Knowledge Repository}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="irinnews.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.irinnews.org/report/75716/pakistan-traditional-marriages-ignore-hiv-aids-threat|title=PAKISTAN: Traditional marriages ignore HIV/AIDS threat|work=IRIN|publisher=United Nations press service|date=6 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dowry===
Like in other parts of [[South Asia]], the custom of [[dowry]] is practised in Pakistan,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Hussain, R. |year=1999|title=Community perceptions of reasons for preference for consanguineous marriages in Pakistan|journal=Journal of Biosocial Science|volume=31|issue=4|pages=449–461|pmid=10581876|doi=10.1017/s0021932099004496}}&lt;/ref&gt; and conflicts related to it often result in violence, even [[dowry death]]s. At over 2000 dowry-related deaths per year, and annual rates exceeding 2.45 deaths per 100,000 women from dowry-related violence, Pakistan has the highest reported number of dowry death rates per 100,000 women in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.refworld.org/pdfid/4e4213da2.pdf |title=Operational Note: Pakistan|publisher=Refworld, A United Nations initiative|date=August 2011|pages=16–21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mpra.ub.uni-muenchen.de/21365/|title=To estimate an equation explaining the determinants of Dowry|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honour killings (''karo-kari'')===
{{Main article|Honour killing in Pakistan}}
A majority of the victims of [[honour killing]]s are women and the punishments meted out to the murderers are very lenient.&lt;ref name="crime_or_custom"/&gt;&lt;ref name="amnesty_honor"&gt;{{cite web

The practice of summary killing of a person suspected of an illicit liaison is known as ''[[karo kari]]'' in Sindh and Balochistan. In December 2004, the Government passed a bill that made ''karo kari'' punishable under the same penal provisions as murder.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Marriage to Quran===
In some parts of [[Sindh]], the practice of marrying a woman to [[Quran]] is prevalent among landlords, although this practice is alien to Islam and has no religious basis. The practice is often used by men to keep and grab the land of their sisters and daughters.&lt;ref name="sadaf_women"&gt;{{cite web

{{Further information|Culture of Pakistan|Role of women in Pakistani media}}
Although Pakistan's population is almost entirely Muslim (96.4% as of 2010&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;), women's  status differs significantly by community.&lt;ref name=Sathar&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.pide.org.pk/pdf/PDR/2000/Volume2/89-110.pdf | title=Women's Autonomy in the Context of Rural Pakistan | author=Zeba Ayesha Sathar |author2=Shahnaz Kazi | journal=The Pakistan Development Review | year=2000 | volume=39 | issue=2 | pages=89–110}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Women's dress varies depending on region, class and occasion, but [[shalwar kameez]] is the principal garment worn by Pakistani women.&lt;ref name="wluml_dresscodes"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wluml.org/english/exhibitions/dresscodes/06-pakistan.ppt|title=Pakistan Dresscodes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070927011900/http://www.wluml.org/english/exhibitions/dresscodes/06-pakistan.ppt |archivedate= 27 September 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gharara]]s (a loose divided skirt worn with a blouse) and [[lehenga]]s were once common, but are now worn mostly at weddings.

Few Pakistani women wear the [[hijab]] or [[burqa]] in public, and the degree to which they choose to cover varies; with the use of the burqa being primarily predominant in [[Pashtuns|Pashtun]] territories.&lt;ref name=Sherazee&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1102048 | title='The difference between black and blue' | work=Dawn.com | date=25 April 2014 | accessdate=5 July 2016 | author=Sherazee, Mahnoor }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Some traditionally Afghan clothing styles have become prevalent in recent decades in some areas of Pakistan.&lt;ref name=Sherazee/&gt; 
Pakistan has no laws banning or enforcing the hijab. Surveys conducted in Pakistan show that most women wearing the hijab do so of their own choice. The veil is not an absolute requirement, and  women may even wear jeans and T-shirts in urban areas of [[Karachi]], [[Lahore]], [[Islamabad]] and other big cities. In last five years, western dressing has become much common among women in cities. Many women wear pants, plazzo and tight jeans with long shirts as well as short shirts. Most women in small cities and rural areas wear the Shalwar Kameez, which consists of a tunic top and baggy trouser set which covers their arms, legs and body. A loose [[dupatta]] scarf is also worn around the shoulders, upper chest and head. Men also have a similar dress code, but only women are expected to wear a dupatta in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.virtualtourist.com/travel/Asia/Pakistan/Local_Customs-Pakistan-Clothing-BR-1.html | title=Clothing in Pakistan and other Local Custom Reviews | work=VirtualTourist | accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://studenttravel.about.com/od/womenstudenttravelers/a/muslimclothing.htm | title=Women's Muslim Dress - Women Traveler's Dress in Islamic Countries | work=Student Travel Planning | date=9 February 2015 | accessdate=5 July 2016 | author=Crislip, Kathleen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Pakistani women who do not wear the hijab may wear the dupatta or [[Chador|chadar]] instead.
A [[sari]] is a formal dress worn on special occasions by some, mainly urban, women. The [[Muhammad Zia-ul-Haq's Islamization|Islamization under General Zia ul Haq's dictatorship]] branded the sari as an "un-Islamic" form of dress.&lt;ref name="wluml_dresscodes"/&gt; but it has made a comeback in fashionable circles.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

==Education and economic development==
In Pakistan, the women's access to property, education, employment etc. remains considerably lower compared to men's.&lt;ref name="sd_dim_pak"/&gt; The social and cultural context of Pakistani society has historically been predominantly patriarchal.&lt;ref name="adb_wom_pak"/&gt; Women have a low percentage of participation in society outside of the family.&lt;ref&gt;United Nations' Women's Indicators and Statistics, 1994, Pakistan Gender Indic ators – projections for 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the improvement in Pakistan's [[literacy rate]] since its independence, the educational status of Pakistani women is among the lowest in the world.&lt;ref name="sd_dim_pak"/&gt; The literacy rate for urban women is more than five times the rate for rural women.&lt;ref name="ESCAP"/&gt; The literacy rate is still lower for women compared to men: the literacy rate is 45.8% for females, while for males it is 69.5% (aged 15 or older, data from 2015).&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;

At the end of the 20th century, the school drop-out rate among girls was very high (almost 50 percent), even though the educational achievements of female students were higher than male students at different levels of education.&lt;ref name="adb_wom_pak"/&gt; Since then, education for women has improved rapidly. In [[Lahore]] there are 46 public colleges out of which 26 are female colleges and some of the others are co-educational. Similarly the public universities of Pakistan have female enrollment than male.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Noor has written 442 stories on this site. |url=http://www.student-media.com/education-in-pakistan-for-women/ |title=Education in Pakistan for Women, Women Education in Pakistan &amp;#124; Student Media, News &amp; New Research articles around the world |publisher=Student-media.com |date=11 September 2011 |accessdate=2012-01-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

UNESCO and the Orascom subsidiary of Pakistan telco, Mobilink have been using mobile phones to educate women and improve their literacy skills since 4 July 2010. The local BUNYAD Foundation of Lahore and the UN's work via the Dakar Framework of Action for EFA are also helping with this issue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ictec.wordpress.com/2011/06/18/improving-female-literacy-through-icts-in-pakistan/ |title=Improving female literacy through ICTs in Pakistan « ICTs, Education &amp; Entrepreneurship |publisher=Ictec.wordpress.com |date=18 June 2011 |accessdate=2012-01-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As of 2010,&lt;!-- That's what the reference shows --&gt; the literacy rate of females in Pakistan was at 39.6 percent compared to that of males at 67.7 percent.&lt;ref name="lloyd105"&gt;{{Cite journal| last =Lloyd | first =Cynthia | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Rural girls in Pakistan: Constraints of policy and culture | journal = | volume =1 | issue =1 | pages =105–110 | publisher= | location = | date = | url =http://www.cgdev.org/doc/books/lewis-lockheed-eduCaseStudies/lewis-lockheed-chapter4.pdf | issn = | doi = | id = | accessdate =2010-01-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;  More recent statistics provided by the UNICEF - shows that female education amongst 15-24 year olds has increased substantially to 61.5% - an increase of 45%. Male education is at a steady rate of 71.2%.&lt;ref name="unicef1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org/infobycountry/pakistan_pakistan_statistics.html |title=Statistics &amp;#124; Pakistan |publisher=UNICEF |date= |accessdate=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The objectives of education policies in Pakistan aim to achieve equality in education between girls and boys and to reduce the gender gap in the educational system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Qureshi | first=Rashida | coauthors= | editor= | others= | title=Gender and Education in Pakistan | year=2007 | month= | url= | type=Hardcover| accessdate= | edition=1st | date= | publisher=University Press | location=Oxford  | id= | pages= | chapter=1 | chapterurl= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the policy also encourages girls, mainly in rural areas of Pakistan, to acquire basic home management skills, which are preferred over full-scale primary education.  The attitudes towards women in Pakistani culture make the fight for educational equality more difficult.  The lack of democracy and feudal practices of Pakistan also contribute to the gender gap in the educational system.&lt;ref name="lloyd105"/&gt; 
Girls of rural areas are facing many problems regarding their studies. There are several issues and causes of education problems for girls in rural areas of Pakistan.
Inaccessibility of education in Pakistan, especially in backward areas is a result of distance, child labor, scarcity of teachers, local leaders, frequent policy changes and fear of losing power. In KPK and Balochistan women are severely bound by cultural constraints and prejudices. They are involved in reproductive and productive and community work for 14 to 18 hours. Women which are the 51% on the country population, have been forced to just bear children for their husband and remain within their houses. In Balochistan, female literacy rate stands between 15 to 25%.
In backward areas, girls schools are far away from their homes, many families cannot afford traveling expenses for their children. Separate schools for girls are not available. Girls are living under the fear of extremist. In KPK militant groups have blasted thousands of schools because they are against women education , they have given threats to several governments and private girls school for stopping girls education.&lt;ref&gt;https://nation.com.pk/21-Feb-2015/women-education-in-pakistan&lt;/ref&gt; 

This [[Feudalism in Pakistan|feudal system]] leaves the underpowered, women in particular, in a very vulnerable position.  The long-lived socio-cultural belief that women play a reproductive role within the confines of the home leads to the belief that educating women holds no value. Although the government declared that all children of the ages 5–16 can go to school, there are 7.261 million children out of school at the primary level in Pakistan, and 58% are female (UNESCO, Education for All Global Monitoring Report 2011).&lt;ref name="nargis1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Nargis|first=Sultana|title=Right to Education for Girls in Pakistan: Malala's Struggle Must Continue|url=http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/right-education-girls-pakistan-malala-s-struggle-must-continue|accessdate=25 April 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140517115947/http://www.opensocietyfoundations.org/voices/right-education-girls-pakistan-malala-s-struggle-must-continue|archive-date=17 May 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although girls have the right to get an education legally, in many rural regions of Pakistan girls are strongly discouraged from going to school and discriminated against, as there are violent acts such as [[acid throwing]] which many girls fall victim to for attending school.

===Rural/urban divide and government policy===
Females are educated equally like Males in urban areas such as Lahore, Islamabad and Karachi. However, in rural areas, the education rate is substantially lower. This has begun to change with the issuance of government policy, in which 70% of new schools are built for girls,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1108131/70pc-of-new-schools-in-kp-will-be-for-girls |title=70pc of new schools in KP will be for girls - Pakistan |publisher=Dawn.Com |date= |accessdate=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and also plans to increase the size of women's school so that the infrastructure matches those of men's schools&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.omantribune.com/index.php?page=news&amp;id=168263&amp;heading=Pakistan |title=KP readies to start more girls' schools |publisher=Oman Tribune |date= |accessdate=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; and more female colleges have also been established in order to provide women with higher education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thenews.com.pk/Todays-News-7-251661-2-girls-colleges-to-be-established |title=2 girls colleges to be established |publisher=The News |date=23 May 2014 |accessdate=2014-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Women in elite urban districts of Pakistan enjoy a far more privileged lifestyle than those living in rural tribal areas.   Women in urbanized districts typically lead more elite lifestyles and have more opportunities for education.  Rural and tribal areas of Pakistan have an increasingly high rate of poverty and alarmingly low literacy rates.  In 2002 it was recorded that 81.5 percent of 15- to 19-year-old girls from high-income families had attended school while 22.3 percent of girls from low-income families had ever attended school.&lt;ref name="lloyd105"/&gt;  

In comparison, it was recorded that 96.6 percent of Pakistani boys ages 15–19 coming from high-income families had attended schooling while 66.1 percent of 15- to 19-year-old boys from low-income families had attended school.&lt;ref name="lloyd105"/&gt; Girls living in rural areas are encouraged not to go to school because they are needed in the home to do work at a young age.  In most rural villages, secondary schooling simply does not exist for girls, leaving them no choice but to prepare for marriage and do household tasks. These rural areas often have inadequate funding and schooling for girls is at the bottom of their priorities.

===Employment===
Pakistan is a largely rural society (almost two thirds of the population lives in rural areas&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;) and women are rarely formally employed. This does not mean that women do not participate in the economy: quite on the contrary, women usually work on the farm of the household, practice [[subsistence agriculture]], or otherwise work within the household economic unit.&lt;ref name=Sathar/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/008/af348e/af348e07.htm|title=Rural women in household production: Increasing contributions and persisting drudgery|publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, women are often prevented from advancing economically, due to social restrictions on women's movement and gender mixing, as well as due to low education.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.urban.org/sites/default/files/alfresco/publication-pdfs/2000601-Women-in-Pakistan-Urban-Informal-Economy.pdf | title=Women in Pakistan's Urban Informal Economy | year=2016 | accessdate=5 July 2016 | author=Ammar A. Malik}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Workforce participation====
Although women play an active role in Pakistan's economy, their contribution has been grossly underreported in some censuses and surveys.&lt;ref name="sd_dim_pak"/&gt;  Part of the understimation of women's economic role is that Pakistan, like many other countries, has a very large [[informal sector]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.ilo.org/islamabad/areasofwork/informal-economy/lang--en/index.htm%3C/ref%3E%3Cref%3Ehttp://www.jespk.net/publications/228.pdf | title=Informal economy in Pakistan | publisher=International Labour Organization | accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The 1991–92 [[Labour Force Survey]] revealed that only about 16% of women aged 10 years and over were in the labour force. According to [[World Bank]], in 2014, women made up 22.3% of the labour force in Pakistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://data.worldbank.org/indicator/SL.TLF.TOTL.FE.ZS | title=Labor force, female (% of total labor force) | publisher=The World Bank | accessdate=5 July 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

According to the 1999 report by the Human Rights Commission of Pakistan, only two percent of Pakistani women participate in the formal sector of employment.&lt;ref&gt;Human Rights Commission of Pakistan's 1999 Report.&lt;/ref&gt; However, the 1980 agricultural census stated that the women's participation rate in agriculture was 73%. The 1990–1991 Pakistan Integrated Household Survey indicated that the female labour force participation rate was 45% in rural areas and 17% the urban areas.&lt;ref name="sd_dim_pak"/&gt; Pakistani women play a major role in agricultural production, livestock raising and cottage industries.&lt;ref name="sd_dim_pak"/&gt;

In 2008, it was recorded that 21.8 percent of females were participating in the labor force in Pakistan while 82.7 percent of men were involved in labor.&lt;ref name="hayat13"&gt;{{Cite journal | last =Hayat | first =Malik | authorlink = | coauthors = | title =Pakistan Employment Trends for Women | journal =Labour Market Information and Analysis Unit | volume =5 | issue =2 | pages =13–17 | publisher =Ministry of Labour and Manpower | location = | date = | url =http://www.lmis.gov.pk/PETFW%20FINAL%20DRAFT.pdf | issn = | doi = | id = | accessdate =2010-01-13 }}{{Dead link|date=September 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The rate of women in the labor force has an annual growth rate of 6.5 percent.  Out of the 47 million employed peoples in Pakistan in 2008, only 9 million were women and of those 9 million, 70 percent worked in the agricultural sector.  The income of Pakistani women in the labor force is generally lower than that of men, due in part to a lack of formal education.&lt;ref name="hayat13"/&gt; The low female literacy rate is a large obstacle in women taking part in the workforce.

Due to the religious and cultural values in Pakistan, women who do try to enter the workforce are often pushed into the lower of the three employment structures. This structure level, unorganized services sector, has low pay, low job security and low productivity. In order to improve this situation, governmental organizations and political parties need to push for the entrance of women into the organized services sector.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Mahpara | first1 = B. S. | last2 = Qurra-tul-ain | first2 = A. S. | year = 2011 | title = Employment situation of women in pakistan | url = | journal = International Journal of Social Economics | volume = 38 | issue = 2| pages = 98–113 | doi = 10.1108/03068291111091981 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Conservative interpretations of Islam have not promoted women's rights in the workforce, since they value women as keepers of the [[family honor]], support [[gender segregation]], and institutionalization of gender disparities.&lt;ref name="coleman7217"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coleman|first=Isobel|title=Gender Disparities, Economic Growth and Islamization in Pakistan|url=http://www.cfr.org/asia-and-pacific/gender-disparities-economic-growth-islamization-pakistan/p7217|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|access-date=22 June 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504225550/http://www.cfr.org/asia-and-pacific/gender-disparities-economic-growth-islamization-pakistan/p7217|archive-date=4 May 2016|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Furthermore, women who do work are often paid less than minimum wage, because they are seen as lesser beings in comparison to men, and  “their working conditions vis-à-vis females are often hazardous; having long working hours, no medical benefits, no job security, subjected to job discrimination, verbal abuse and sexual harassment and no support from male oriented labor unions”(An In-Depth Analysis of Women's Labor Force Participation in Pakistan).

Although these religious and cultural barriers exist keeping women away from the workforce, studies have shown that women-only entrepreneurial training that allows participants to develop capital and competences, can break these down. Programs such as this can go a long way in an Islamic socio-cultural context to develop tolerance and understanding.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Muhammad | first1 = A.

===Land and property rights===
Around 90% of the Pakistani households are headed by men and most female-headed households belong to the poor strata of the society&lt;ref name="ESCAP"/&gt;&lt;ref name="sd_dim_pak"/&gt;

Women lack ownership of productive resources. Despite women's legal rights to own and inherit property from their families, in 2000 there were very few women who had access and control over these resources.&lt;ref name="adb_wom_pak"/&gt;

==Other concerns==

===Gender roles===
[[File:Kashmiri_girl.jpg|thumb|A girl in [[North Pakistan]].]]
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:MalihaLodhiUN.jpg|thumb|right|[[Permanent Representative of Pakistan to the United Nations]] [[Maliha Lodhi]] addressing the [[United Nations Security Council]].]] --&gt;

Pakistan is a [[patriarchal]] society where men are the primary authority figures and women are subordinate.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender roles and their influence on life prospects for women in urban Karachi, Pakistan: a qualitative study|url=http://ecommons.aku.edu/pakistan_fhs_son/21|work=The Aga Khan University|publisher=Global Health Action|authors=Ali, T., Krantz, G., Gul, R., Asad, N., Johansson, E., Mogren, I.|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gender is one of the organizing principles of Pakistani society. Patriarchal values embedded in local traditions, religion and culture predetermine the social value of gender. Islam heavily influences gender roles in particular. An artificial divide between production and reproduction, made by the ideology of [[sexual division of labor]], has placed women in reproductive roles as mothers and wives in the private arena of home and men in a productive role as breadwinners in the public arena.&lt;ref name=Mariam&gt;{{cite book|last=West|first=Asian Development Bank, Programs Department|title=Women in Pakistan|date=2000|publisher=Asian Development Bank, Programs Dept. (West) and Office of Environment and Social Development|location=[Philippines]|isbn=971-561-297-0|url=http://www.adb.org/sites/default/files/pub/2000/women_pakistan.pdf|author2=Mariam S. Pal|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150725014619/http://adb.org/sites/default/files/pub/2000/women_pakistan.pdf|archivedate=25 July 2015|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pakistani women lack social value and status because of negation of their roles as producers and providers in all social roles. The preference for sons due to their productive role often dictates the allocation of household resources in their favor. Traditionally, male members of the family are given better education and are equipped with skills to compete for resources in the public arena, while female members are imparted domestic skills to be good mothers and wives. Lack of skills, limited opportunities in the job market, and social, religious and cultural restrictions limit women’s chances to compete for resources in the public arena.&lt;ref name = Mariam/&gt;

This situation has led to the social and economic dependency of women that becomes the basis for male power over women in all social relationships. However, the spread of [[patriarchy]] is not even. The nature and degree of women’s subordination vary across classes, regions, and the rural/urban divide. Patriarchal structures are relatively stronger in the rural and tribal setting where local customs establish male authority and power over women's lives. On the other hand, women belonging to the upper and middle classes have increasingly greater access to education and employment opportunities and can assume greater control over their lives.&lt;ref name = Mariam/&gt;

According to Pakistani standards, 'good women' could be either educated or uneducated and are expected to be unselfish, calm, tolerant, empathetic, reliable, able to organize, compromise, coordinate and maintain hospitality within the house and in keeping good relationships.&lt;ref name=TazGenderKar /&gt; They are also expected to do household chores, care for her children, husband and in-laws and, when needed, provide the home with external income.&lt;ref name=TazGenderKar&gt;{{cite web|last=Ali|first=Tazeen S|title=Gender roles and their influence on life prospects for women in urban Karachi, Pak0istan: a qualitative study|pmc=3208374 |author2=Krantz, Gunilla; Gul, Raisa; Asad, Nargis; Johansson, Eva; Mogren, Ingrid|doi=10.3402/gha.v4i0.7448|date=2 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Women are also expected to marry a man of their [[Arranged marriage|parent's choice]], follow Islam's code of dress&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=How people in Muslim countries prefer women to dress in public|url=http://pewrsr.ch/KEyUvb| |work=University of Michigan’s Institute for Social Research|publisher=Pew Research Centre}}&lt;/ref&gt; and sacrifice their own dreams.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gender roles and their influence on life prospects for women in urban Karachi, Pakistan: a qualitative study|url=http://www.globalhealthaction.net/index.php/gha/article/view/7448/13343#AF0002 |work=Global Health Action|publisher=Global Health Action|authors=Ali, T., Krantz, G., Gul, R., Asad, N., Johansson, E., Mogren, I.|year=2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study carried out by [[Gallup Pakistan]], the Pakistani affiliate of Gallup International, majority of the Pakistanis believe that both males and females have different roles to play in the society. Although women’s role has broadened beyond being a housewife over time, many people still give priority to men in politics, education, employment, and related walks of life. When the respondents were asked to give their opinion on a number of statements about gender roles 63% of the respondents agreed with the statement that "Boys’ education is more important than girls’"; 37% disagreed with it. The percentage of people agreeing with this statement was higher among rurallites (67%) as compared to the urbanites (53%). However, more than 90% believe that [[Women's education in Pakistan|female children should be educated]], nearly half of them believing that, should opportunity be available, they should rise to college education and beyond.

Fifty five percent (55%) of the respondents believe that "Both husband and wife should work"; while 45% said it is wrong for both husband and the wife to work. More than 50% of men including those from rural areas agree that both husband and wife should work for a better living.  When the respondents were asked whether "Men are better politicians as compared to women or not"; 67% agree men are better politicians while 33% think otherwise. More women agree with this statement as compared to men. In response to the following statement "If jobs are in shortage should men be given priority for employment"; 72% of the respondents believe they should be given priority while 28% disagree. Eighty three percent (83%) of the respondents think that "To live a happy life women need children"; while only 17% think they do not. A vast majority of all respondents including 82% of women respondents believe that "prosperous women should raise their voice to support the rights of poor women."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gallup Pakistan Poll Findings on Gender Roles|url=http://www.gallup.com.pk/Polls/27-4-09.pdf|work=Gallup Pakistan|publisher=Gilani Research Foundation|page=2|year=2009|access-date=29 May 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140529182019/http://www.gallup.com.pk/Polls/27-4-09.pdf|archive-date=29 May 2014|dead-url=yes|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and divorce issues===
The average age of women for marriage increased from 16.9 years in 1951 to 22.5 years in 2005. A majority of women are married to their close relatives, i.e., first and second cousins. Only 37 percent of married women are not related to their spouses before marriage.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}} A study published in 2000 recorded that the divorce rate in Pakistan was extremely low due to the social stigma attached to it.&lt;ref name="adb_wom_pak"/&gt;

Many girls are still married off into a child marriage, and many complications with this can occur as childbirth from a child can cause complications with the baby and mother.&lt;ref name="ghosh1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Ghosh|first=Palash|title=Child Marriage Should Be Legal: Pakistani Legal Advisory Body|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/child-marriage-should-be-legal-pakistani-legal-advisory-body-1560767|publisher=IBT Media|accessdate=16 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; A common system in place with marriage is the Dowry system in which a low or no status is assigned to a girl right from the prenatal stage.There are issues around the dowry system such as dowry related violence, in which the wife is abused by her husband. Before the marriage, the groom will make heavy financial demands on the bride's family as a condition of marrying their daughter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=PAKISTAN: Apathy of the State and the Civil Society towards a Violence Called Dowry|url=http://www.humanrights.asia/news/ahrc-news/AHRC-ART-017-2014|accessdate=10 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In order for many parents' daughters to get married, they start "obtaining loans from people, getting interest based loans from banks, utilising their life savings and even sell their homes" (JAHEZ (Dowry Conditions Set by the Groom for Marriage)). Within the dowry system, abuse is likely to occur after the marriage has taken place. Prior to the marriage, if certain conditions that the groom and his family have put in place are not met, they will threaten to break off the marriage, which would be devastating for the bride and her family because of the lengths the bride's family already had to go through to pay her dowry and because traditionally it is a great dishonor to the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Danka|first=Mutfi|title=JAHEZ (Dowry Conditions Set by the Groom for Marriage)|url=http://www.croydonmosque.com/pdf/JAHEZ%20Dowry%20Conditions%20set%20by%20the%20Groom%20for%20Marriage.pdf|accessdate=15 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Health===
{{see also|Family planning in Pakistan}}

According to 1998 figures, the female infant mortality rate was higher than that of male children. The maternal mortality rate was also high, as only 20 percent of women were assisted by a trained provider during delivery.&lt;ref name="adb_wom_pak"/&gt; Only 9 percent of women used contraceptives in 1985, but by 2000 this figure had increased substantially,&lt;ref name="adb_wom_pak"/&gt; and as of 2012/13, the contraceptive prevalence rate was 35.4%.&lt;ref name=CIA&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/pk.html|title=The World Factbook|publisher=[[CIA]]|date=17 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[total fertility rate]] is 2.75 children born/woman (2015 est.).&lt;ref name=CIA/&gt;

Pakistan has taken certain initiatives in the health sector to redress gender imbalances. The SAP was launched in 1992–1993 to accelerate improvement in the social indicators. Closing the gender gap is the foremost objective of the SAP. The other major initiative is the Prime Minister's program of lady health workers (LHWs). Under this community-based program, 26,584 LHWs in rural areas and 11,967 LHWs in urban areas have been recruited to provide basic health care including family planning to women at the grassroots level. Other initiatives include the village-based family planning workers and extended immunisation programs, nutritional and child survival, cancer treatment, and increased involvement of media in health education.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3211">The '''Zipser Germans''' or '''Zipsers''' ({{lang-de|Zipser}}, {{lang-ro|Ţipţeri}}, {{lang-hu|Cipszer}}) are a German-speaking (specifically [[Zipser German]]-speaking) ethnic group which developed in the [[Spiš|Zips region]] of [[Upper Hungary]]—what is now [[Slovakia]]—as that region was settled by people from central Germany beginning in the 13th century.&lt;ref name="KJS"&gt;Karl Julius Schröer, ''Die deutschen Mundarten des ungrischen Berglandes'' (1864)&lt;/ref&gt; Beginning in at least the 18th century, many members of the ethnic group migrated to northern [[Romania]], including to southern [[Bukovina]]&lt;ref name="Hadb2"&gt;Oskar Hadbawnik, ''Die Zipser in der Bukowina'' (1968) discusses the Zipserfest held in Jakobeny in 1936 to commemorate 150 years since the Zipsers migrated to Jakobeny in 1786.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LBD"&gt;І. Я. Яцюк, ''Тернопільський національний педагогічний університет ім. Володимира Гнатюка'', ''Наукові записки. Серія “Філологічна”'', ''УДК 81’282.4:811.112.2(477)'': ''Lexikalische Besonderheiten Deutscher Dialekte in Galizien- und der Bukowina'': “Die Siedler in den ursprünglichen Bergwerksgemeinden im Südwesten der Bukowina sprachen Zipserisch und zwar Gründlerisch, wie es in der Unterzips gesprochen wurde. Dabei wurde [v] im Anlaut wie [b] ausgesprochen: Werke – berka, weh – be, Schwester – schbesta. Anlautendes [b] wurde zu [p]: Brot – prot, Brücke – prik.”&lt;/ref&gt; and to [[Maramureş|Maramuresch]] and [[Transylvania]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacob Steigerwald, ''Tracing Romania's heterogeneous German minority'' (1985), page 8&lt;/ref&gt;

During and after the [[Second World War]], most Zipsers evacuated or were expelled to Germany. A community of speakers remains in the Zips town of [[Chmeľnica]] (''Hopgarten'') (their distinctive dialect is called "Outzäpsersch", German: "Altzipserisch", literally "Old Zipserish"),&lt;ref&gt;Somewhat confusingly, literature on the language also uses "Altzipserisch" in two other ways: to refer to the dialect of the Upper Zips as contrasted with "Gründlerisch", and to refer to the original Central German (Gründlerisch) lect of the speakers who migrated to Romania, as contrasted with the Upper-Austrian-influenced lect they now speak. For example, Claus Stephani in ''Zipser Mära und Kasska'' (1989) writes that the later settlers "sprachen Oberösterreichisch, die anderen eine Gründler Mundart: Altzipserisch" (spoke Upper Austrian, [while] the others [spoke] a Gründler dialect: Old Zipserish).&lt;/ref&gt; and others remain in Romania where they and other German-speaking groups are currently represented by the [[Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania]] (DFDR).
