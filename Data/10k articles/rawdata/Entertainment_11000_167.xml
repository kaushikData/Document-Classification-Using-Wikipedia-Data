'''Action origami''' is [[origami]] that can be animated, first appearing with the traditional Japanese flapping bird. The original traditional action model is the flapping bird. Typically models where the final assembly involves some special action, for instance blowing up a waterbomb, are also classed as action origami. More rarely models like [[paper plane]] and spinners which have no moving parts are included. Some traditional action origami involved cuts but modern models typically are built with no cuts. Action origami are normally toys built to amuse but some are designed to inspire wonder.

==Action toys==
[[File:Żaba - origami.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Jumping frog]]
Action toys include birds or butterflies with flapping wings, beaks that peck, and frogs that hop,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Origami in Action: Paper Toys that Fly, Flap, Gobble and Inflate|author=Robert J. Lang|authorlink=Robert J. Lang|isbn=0-312-15618-9|publisher=St. Martin's Griifin|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as popular traditional models like the [[Paper fortune teller|fortune teller]]. [[Paper popper]]s or bangers are models that make a noise when flicked down hard.

Some action origami is designed to accompany a story whilst it is built.

==Complex models==
Some models are far more complex than can be classed as toys.They are built to amaze and astonish. For instance [[Robert J. Lang]]'s Bassist, Pianist, and Violinist is a set of action models where each one plays an instrument when pulled on appropriately.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.langorigami.com/art/gallery/gallery.php4?name=instrumentalists|title=Bassist, Pianist, and Violinist|author=Robert J Lang}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jeremy Shafer has made a number of extraordinary action models including a Swiss army knife with tools that open out, a slithering snake skin, and flashers, one of which he demonstrated on ''[[The Carol Duvall Show]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Origami to Astonish and Amuse|author=Jeremy Shafer|authorlink=Jeremy Shafer|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=0-312-25404-0|year=2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical models==
[[Image:Origami spring.jpg|thumb|200px|''[[Spring (device)|Spring]] Into Action'', designed by Jeff Beynon.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www1.ttcn.ne.jp/~a-nishi/ The World of Geometric Toy], ''[http://www1.ttcn.ne.jp/~a-nishi/spring/z_spring.html Origami Spring]'', August, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;]]

Flashers are models with a regular pattern that can be folded up small and rapidly expanded. The [[miura fold]] is a similar idea that has been used in commercial applications. Versions on a regular pattern can for instance be used to make a human figure when folded up or a maze when opened.

==Action origami using smart materials==
Different smart material technologies are used by the researchers to yield active action origami structures. Scientists and engineers are using materials such as electroactive polymers (EAP),&lt;ref&gt;S Ahmed et al 2014 Smart Mater. Struct. 23 094003&lt;/ref&gt; shape memory polymers,&lt;ref&gt;Soft Matter, 2013,9, 7688–7694&lt;/ref&gt; and shape memory alloys&lt;ref&gt;2014 Smart Mater. Struct. 23 094001&lt;/ref&gt; to achieve action origami structures. This origami-inspired concept has wide range of applications such as space deployable solar array, heart stent, morphing wings etc.,&lt;ref&gt;Proc. SPIE 9432, Behavior and Mechanics of Multifunctional Materials and Composites 2015, 943206 (April 1, 2015)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Soft Matter, 2012,8, 1764–1769&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kjelkeoverisen.jpg|thumb|260px|[[Fridtjof Nansen]] reached a record latitude of 86°14′ during his [[Nansen's Fram expedition|North Pole expedition]] of 1893–96. ]]

An '''adventure''' is an exciting experience that is typically a bold, sometimes [[risk]]y, undertaking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dictionary.reference.com/browse/adventure |title=Adventure |work=dictionary.com |date= |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Adventures may be activities with some potential for physical danger such as [[traveling]], [[exploring]], [[skydiving]], [[mountain climbing]], [[scuba diving]], [[river rafting]] or participating in [[extreme sports]].

==Motivation==
Adventurous experiences create psychological [[arousal]],&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6YjcgAn8TfsC&amp;pg=PA187 |title=On the psychobiology of personality |chapter=Sensation Seeking and Participation in Physical Risk Sports |author=M Gomà-i-Freixanet |year=2004 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=978-0-08-044209-9 |page=187}}&lt;/ref&gt; which can be interpreted as negative (e.g. [[fear]]) or positive (e.g. [[flow (psychology)|flow]]).  For some people, adventure becomes a major pursuit in and of itself. According to adventurer [[André Malraux]], in his ''La Condition Humaine'' (1933), "If a man is not ready to risk his life, where is his dignity?".{{full citation needed|date=June 2013}} Similarly, [[Helen Keller]] stated that "Life is either a daring adventure or nothing."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Keller|first=Helen|title=The Open Door|year=1957}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outdoor adventurous activities are typically undertaken for the purposes of [[recreation]] or [[wikt:excitement|excitement]]: examples are [[adventure racing]] and [[Adventure travel|adventure tourism]]. Adventurous activities can also lead to gains in knowledge, such as those undertaken by explorers and pioneers – the British adventurer [[Jason Lewis (adventurer)|Jason Lewis]], for example, uses adventures to draw global [[sustainability]] lessons from living within finite environmental constraints on expeditions to share with schoolchildren. [[Adventure education]] intentionally uses challenging experiences for [[learning]].

==Adventure in mythology and fiction==
Some of the oldest and most widespread stories in the world are stories of adventure such as [[Homer]]'s ''[[The Odyssey]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/02/14/books/review/Mansbach-t.html|title=Odysseus Remixed|author=Adam Mansbach|date=12 February 2010|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Richard Jenkyns |url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/98/05/31/reviews/fagles-odyssey.html |title=Heroic Enterprise – (Book review: The Odyssey translated by Robert Fagles) |publisher=nytimes.com |date=1996-12-22 |accessdate=2013-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zweig, P. (1974). ''The adventurer: The fate of adventure in the Western world'', New York: Basic Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[knight errant]] was the form the "adventure seeker" character took in the late Middle Ages.

The [[adventure novel]] exhibits these "protagonist on adventurous journey" characteristics as do many popular feature [[Adventure film|films]], such as ''[[Star Wars (film)|Star Wars]]''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1977/05/26/movies/moviesspecial/26STAR.html|title=A Trip to a Far Galaxy That's Fun and Funny|author=Vincent Canby|date=26 May 1977|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Raiders of the Lost Ark]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?res=EE05E7DF173AA42CA1494CC6B6799D836896|title=Movie Review: Raiders of the Lost Ark|author=Vincent Canby|date=12 June 1981|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Alice's Adventures in Wonderland - Carroll, Robinson - S001 - Cover.jpg|thumb|right|[[Lewis Carroll]]'s ''[[Alice's Adventures in Wonderland]]'' is a well-known example of a fantasized adventure story.]]

===Outdoors===
Adventure books may have the theme of the hero or main character going to face the [[wilderness]] or [[Mother Nature]]. Examples include books such as [[Hatchet (book)|Hatchet]] or [[My Side of the Mountain]]. These books are less about "questing", such as in mythology or other adventure novels, but more about surviving on their own, living off the land, gaining new experiences, and becoming closer to the natural world.

===Questing===
Many adventures are based on the idea of a quest: the hero goes off in pursuit of a reward, whether it be a skill, prize, or perhaps the safety of a person. On the way, the hero must overcome various obstacles. Mythologist [[Joseph Campbell]] discussed his notion of the [[monomyth]] in his book, ''[[The Hero with a Thousand Faces]]''. Campbell proposed that the heroic mythological stories from culture to culture followed a similar underlying pattern, starting with the "call to adventure", followed by a hazardous journey, and eventual triumph.

===Video games===
{{See also|Adventure game}}
{{Expand section|date=January 2018}}
Many [[video games]] are adventure games.

==Adventure in nonfiction==
From ancient times, travelers and explorers have written about their adventures. Journals which became best-sellers in their day were written, such as [[Marco Polo]]'s journal ''[[The Travels of Marco Polo]]'' or [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Roughing It]]''. Others were personal journals, only later published, such as the journals of [[Meriwether Lewis|Lewis]] and [[William Clark|Clark]] or [[Captain James Cook]]'s journals. There are also books written by those not directly a part of the adventure in question, such as [[The Right Stuff (book)|The Right Stuff]] by [[Tom Wolfe]], or books written by those participating in the adventure but in a format other than that of a journal, such as Conquistadors of the Useless by [[Lionel Terray]]. Documentaries often use the theme of adventure as well.

==Adventure sports==
There are many sports classified as adventure sports, due to their inherent danger and excitement. Some of these include [[mountain climbing]], [[skydiving]], or other [[extreme sports]].

[[File:JihadBarney.jpg|right|thumb|175px|Cover of ''The Jihad to Destroy Barney'' (1990s) [[roleplaying]] guidebook.]]
'''Anti-Barney humor''' is a form of [[humor]] that targets the children's television series ''[[Barney &amp; Friends]]''. The notion that the show is "saccharine", "boring", "annoying", "sugary", "dangerous" or "uneducational" has made the program a target for parody and negative attacks by children of various ages, adolescents, and adults in the [[United States]] and elsewhere. Other popular children's characters such as [[Dora the Explorer]], [[Bert and Ernie]], [[Elmo]], [[Caillou]], [[Peppa Pig]], [[SpongeBob SquarePants]] and the [[Teletubbies]] have been subject to subversive adult humor; in Barney's case, however, the humor has typically been far more [[dark comedy|dark]] and the attacks more vicious and hostile toward Barney, with practitioners openly and regularly speaking of their desire to kill the title character.

Anti-Barney humor was most popular in the mid-1990s, at the peak of the show's popularity, and was pervasive in popular culture during that time frame.

==History==
Almost immediately after ''Barney and Friends'' first aired in 1992, the result was that it mesmerized and fascinated many viewers under the age of four, but was strongly disapproved of by most older children and young adults, who criticized it for being "saccharine", "sunshine-and-flowers", and "one-dimensional".&lt;ref name=WJTMitchell /&gt; [[University of Chicago]] professor [[W. J. T. Mitchell]] noted that {{blockquote|"Barney is on the receiving end of more hostility than just about any other popular cultural icon I can think of. Parents admit to a cordial dislike of the saccharine saurian, and no self-respecting second-grader will admit to liking Barney."&lt;ref name=WJTMitchell&gt;{{cite book | chapterurl=http://www.press.uchicago.edu/Misc/Chicago/532046.html | first=W.J.T. | last=Mitchell | authorlink=W. J. T. Mitchell | title=The Last Dinosaur Book: The Life and Times of a Cultural Icon | chapter=Chapter 37: Why Children Hate Dinosaurs | publisher=[[University of Chicago Press]] | year=1998 | isbn=0-226-53204-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

These children were among the first to practice anti-Barney humor, and were given an entire chapter of the 1995 book ''Greasy Grimy Gopher Guts: The Subversive Folklore of Childhood.''&lt;ref&gt;''Greasy Grimy Gopher Guts: The Subversive Folklore of Childhood,'' by Josepha Sherman and T.K.F. Weisskopf, {{ISBN|0-87483-444-9}} (see {{cite web|url=http://www.greenmanreview.com/greasy_grimy_gopher_guts.html |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010312235715/http://www.greenmanreview.com/greasy_grimy_gopher_guts.html |archive-date=March 12, 2001 |title=The Green Man Review entry |dead-url=yes |access-date=September 2, 2016 }})&lt;/ref&gt;

Eventually, adults began to contribute to the anti-Barney humor, including some parents and celebrities. Many families now refuse to watch the show because of its supposed "one-dimensionality" and "lack of educational value", and several [[YouTube]] videos have plush dolls of the character being destroyed in various ways, including being [[Combustion|burnt]], destroyed by small [[explosion]]s, being shot by many weapons using [[tannerite]] or being run over by vehicles.

Sources of hostility include episodes where Barney and the other characters do potentially harmful acts such as [[Lie|lying]], [[cheating]], [[stealing]] (with no punishment or scolding from the purple dinosaur), and catching [[Insect bites and stings|stinging]] [[insect]]s.&lt;ref name=talkstrangers&gt;[http://www.jihad.net/non-fiction/bell-babysit.txt] Bellinghausen, Alex. ''Barney: The Babysitter''. Jihad.net non-fiction archives.&lt;/ref&gt;  Other reasons cited for the hostility also include the purple dinosaur's voice (described by many parents as "dopey"), lack of varied facial expressions other than a toothy smile, and personality (described as being "self-centered"), as well as how the children in the series interact with the dinosaur characters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.punkwalrus.com/cybertusk/kill_barney.html | publisher=Punkadyne Labs | accessdate=2008-09-14 | title=Why We Hate Barney | first=Grig| last=Larson }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JihadFAQ5&gt;{{cite newsgroup|newsgroup=alt.barney.dinosaur.die.die.die|url=http://groups.google.ca/group/alt.tv.the-jihad/browse_thread/thread/107b17dd9600986b/58231550ca3041b9?lnk=st&amp;q=barney+dinosaur+FAQ#58231550ca3041b9 | title=The Official FAQ of the Jihad to Destroy Barney the Purple Dinosaur v3.03 (Jihad FAQ, Part 5) | author=The Jihad to Destroy Barney|message-id=12OCT199323305949@ctrvx1.vanderbilt.edu|date=13 Oct 1993 &lt;!-- 04:30:00 GMT --&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Barney vs. The San Diego Chicken'', Ted Giannoulas stated {{blockquote|[...] "Perhaps the most insightful criticism regarding Barney is that his shows do not assist children in learning to deal with negative feelings and emotions. As one commentator puts it, the real danger from Barney is denial: the refusal to recognize the existence of unpleasant realities. For along with his steady diet of giggles and unconditional love, Barney offers our children a one-dimensional world where everyone must be happy and everything must be resolved right away."''&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20080521072121/http://bulk.resource.org/courts.gov/c/F3/179/179.F3d.384.98-11003.html Lyons Partnership v. Ted Giannoulas, 179 F.3d 384, 386 (5th Cir. 1999)], citing Chava Willig Levy, "The Bad News About Barney", ''Parents'', Feb. 1994, at 191-92 (136-39).&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Additionally, the show was ranked #50 on ''[[TV Guide]]''{{'}}s List of the 50 Worst TV Shows of All Time.&lt;ref&gt;''CBS News'': TV Guide's [http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2002/07/12/entertainment/main515057.shtml 50 Worst TV Shows]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

===''Barkley vs. Barney''===
[[Charles Barkley]] was the guest host of ''[[Saturday Night Live]]'' on September 25, 1993, and performed a skit that parodied his ''[[Godzilla]]''-themed [[Godzilla vs. Charles Barkley|Nike commercial]] by facing off against Barney in a one-on-one matchup.&lt;ref&gt;[http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2005/writers/pete_mcentegart/04/15/ten.spot/index.html Pete McEntegart, "The 10 Spot", ''Sports Illustrated'' 10 July 2005]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|Tkix60xjUC8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Baloney and Kids''===
The animated series ''[[Animaniacs]]'' had a [[satire]] episode in which [[Yakko, Wakko, and Dot|the Warner siblings]] confront "Baloney", an orange dinosaur meant to be a parody of Barney. The entire episode is dedicated to lampooning the series, as well as [[PBS]] for airing it (the introduction promotes the show as part of the "SBS (Stupid Broadcasting Service)" while the voice-over says, "''Baloney and Kids'' is brought to you by this station and other stations that lack clever programming."). The Warners try various methods to get rid of Baloney (including dropping anvils on his head; after the second time Baloney says, "Let's do that again!"), but only escape when the show runs out of time, at which point they also take with them three extremely desperate adult members of the regular crew (including [[Hello Nurse (Animaniacs)|Hello Nurse]]).

===Music and related video===
One of the first well known anti-Barney songs was Tony Mason's&lt;ref name="tonyMasonConfession"&gt;[http://www.tonymason.com/ tonymason.com]...For the record...WEIRD AL DID NOT WRITE OR PERFORM Barney's On Fire!!!! I, TONY MASON DID, BACK IN 1993...&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Barney's on Fire]]" (often miscredited to [["Weird Al" Yankovic]], who denied writing the song).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.myspace.com/weirdal Weird Al Yankovic at MySpace]&lt;/ref&gt;  Although Yankovic did not write "Barney's on Fire", he did mention Barney in the lyrics of the parody song "[[Jurassic Park (song)|Jurassic Park]]" (''"...I'm afraid those things'll harm me / 'Cause they sure don't act like Barney..."''). The music video for "Jurassic Park" also includes Barney's head being bitten off by a [[Tyrannosaurus]], who later coughs up the head after receiving the [[Heimlich maneuver]] from a brontosaurus. Comedian [[Stephen Lynch (musician)|Stephen Lynch]] has gained fame from his "Evil Barney Bus Driver" and "Evil Barney Babysitter" audio skits (among others), which he did for [[Opie and Anthony]] in 1997 and which have been commonly posted on the Internet.

An online video created by Ryan Steinhardt in 1998 combines clips from ''Barney and Friends'' with the [[2Pac]] single "[[Hit 'Em Up]]", designed to give the viewer the impression that Barney and the other characters from the show are rapping. The humor is based on the juxtaposition of the actual song's heavy use of profanity and violent content, as opposed to the regular lessons and content on ''Barney and Friends''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;videoid=1175900&amp;searchid=f265ee83-f467-45f7-b83a-2573631bd3b8 |publisher=MySpace |title=Barney Shakur |accessdate=2008-08-10 |year=1998 |first=Ryan |last=Steinhardt }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.daddydesign.com/Barney.html | publisher=Daddy Designs | accessdate=2008-08-10 | title=Site Map: A little entertainment | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080801150758/http://www.daddydesign.com/Barney.html| archivedate= 1 August 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after the show's debut, various parody songs began circulating on elementary school playgrounds to the tune of Barney's closing theme, most of which involved the opening line "I hate you, you hate me, let's team up and kill Barney", and involving various gruesome ways of doing away with the character.

A small Italian comic book imprint, Parody Press (an imprint of Eternity Comics), released an anthology comic book entitled ''Kill Barny'' [sic] in 1994, a collection of short stories and one-page strips depicting the death of the purple dinosaur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.comiccollectorlive.com/LiveData/Issue.aspx?id=900552c5-c4d5-42e3-b822-95ec8e1b0df3 | accessdate=2008-09-14 | title=Kill Barny! 1-A |date=January 1994 | publisher=Comic Collector Live }}&lt;/ref&gt; Several months later, another issue was released under the name ''Kill Barny Again!'', reprinting most of ''Kill Barny'' but with some new material pages and a new cover.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://cgi.ebay.it/Kill-Barny-Again-1st-ed-Vol-1-1-Bevis-Butthead-comic_W0QQitemZ230272794310QQihZ013QQcategoryZ64QQcmdZViewItem | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130218082627/http://cgi.ebay.it/Kill-Barny-Again-1st-ed-Vol-1-1-Bevis-Butthead-comic_W0QQitemZ230272794310QQihZ013QQcategoryZ64QQcmdZViewItem | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2013-02-18 | accessdate=2008-09-14 | title=''Kill Barny Again,'' 1st edition.| language=Italian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Mad Magazine fold-in for issue #328 &lt;!--Date of issue needed--&gt;asked, ''"What Single Goal Has Brought Agreement And Unity Among Vastly Different Groups?"'' and the image, which featured pairs of opposite people proclaiming their support for the answer, folded into a dead Barney with the word "extinct" on it, and the caption then read ''"Death to Barney."''

A 1994 ''[[FoxTrot]]'' comic strip features 10-year-old Jason writing a letter to PBS telling them that Barney should be eating the kids after he saw "Jurassic Park" to which his friend Marcus says he would watch the show if that happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Wildly FoxTrot: A FoxTrot Treasury {{ndash}} Customer Reviews|url=https://www.amazon.com/Wildly-FoxTrot-A-Treasury/product-reviews/0836204166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The science humor magazine ''[[Annals of Improbable Research]]'' published, in its 1995 January and February issue, a [[taxonomical]] article entitled ''The Taxonomy of Barney'' that included X-rays of the character's [[skeleton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://improbable.com/airchives/paperair/volume1/v1i1/barney.htm|title=The Taxonomy of Barney|author=Theriot, Edward C.|accessdate=2007-06-09|date=January–February 1995|publisher=[[Annals of Improbable Research]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Film===
The closing scene of the 1998 film ''[[Mafia!]]'' has an assassin, Nick "The Eskimo" Molinaro, fatally stabbing a purple Barney-like dinosaur (who is seen eagerly watching pornography in his apartment) with a harpoon. The closing credits note that a shrine was built in Molinaro's honor, visited by millions of grateful parents for doing "the one deed to benefit all mankind."

The 2002 film ''[[Death to Smoochy]]'' loosely parodies anti-Barney humor. The film features disgraced former children's star "Rainbow Randolph" (portrayed by [[Robin Williams]]) as he tries to sabotage the Barney-like character that replaced him, a purple rhinoceros named Smoochy (portrayed by [[Edward Norton]]), and later the efforts of the [[Irish Mob]] to kill Smoochy. At one point, Smoochy's resemblance to Barney is acknowledged when Randolph refers to him as "Bastard son of Barney" in the film's final act.

===Internet fiction===
Several works of short fiction have revolved around not only killing Barney, but portraying him as a demonic force to be defeated in an epic tale of good versus evil,&lt;ref name=NonJihadStories /&gt; including a series of short stories written by Brian Bull, such as the ''Day of The Barney'' trilogy about two children who fight the purple dinosaur and free hordes of children from his demonic control,&lt;ref name=NonJihadStories&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.jihad.net/nonjihad.html | publisher=The Jihad to Destroy Barney | accessdate=2008-08-10 | title=The Non-Jihad Story Collection }} Includes works by Brian Bull.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Batman versus Barney''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20000511113042/http://home.earthlink.net/~bcbull/bat1.htm Bull, Brian; "Batman vs. Barney" part 1]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!--Do not write in the actual quote of Elmo's swear words--&gt;
Another YouTube video shows [[Elmo]] singing his "Elmo's World" song while [[Barney and Friends|Barney the Dinosaur]] singing his "I love you" song. As a result of Elmo's hate for Barney's singing, he shoots him with a shotgun or pistol and afterwards swears at the dead Barney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wifBBIc2kIM|title=Elmo kills Barney|publisher=YouTube}} This is one example of the "Elmo kills Barney" videos.

===Jihad===
'''''The Jihad to Destroy Barney''''' is a fictional [[jihad]] that sees itself in the ultimate battle against Barney (spelled ''B'harne'' therein) and his followers. It is described as ''"a heterogeneous organization of people on the Internet dedicated to defamation, humiliation, eradication, killing, and removal of Barney the Purple Dinosaur of the television show ''Barney &amp; Friends'' from the airwaves and from every human's life."''&lt;ref name=Guardian21May2003&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2003/may/21/familyandrelationships.comment | publisher=The Guardian | accessdate=2008-08-03 | date=21 May 2003 | title=No, not the Barney song! | first=Michael | last=Hann | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20080916195230/http://www.guardian.co.uk/media/2003/may/21/familyandrelationships.comment| archivedate= 16 September 2008 &lt;!--DASHBot--&gt;| deadurl= no}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JihadFAQ&gt;[http://www.jihad.net/faq.html Jihad to Destroy Barney: FAQ v3.6x]&lt;/ref&gt; B'harne is depicted as a purple, scaly lizard-like [[demon]] with sharp talons, long teeth and glowing evil red eyes.

References to a Barney "Jihad" were found on Barney-related [[Usenet]] newsgroups as early as 1993.{{citation needed|date=October 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://groups.google.com/group/alt.barney.dinosaur.die.die.die/browse_thread/thread/e7f4856e6784d1fe/b18036567613da74 "Joining the Jihad", alt.barney.dinosaur.die.die.die, 13 October 1993]&lt;/ref&gt; The website itself was active as of 1995.&lt;ref name=NYDN1995&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/archives/money/1995/06/29/1995-06-29_business_is_blooming_on_inte.html |publisher=[[New York Daily News]] |accessdate=2008-08-06 |title=Business is Blooming on Internet |first=Rosemary |last=Metzler Lavan |date=29 June 1995 }}{{dead link|date=October 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PFTN&gt;{{cite book | title=Postcards from the Net: An Australian's Guide to the Wired World | first=Jon | last=Casimir | publisher=Allen &amp; Unwin | year=1997 | isbn=1-86448-233-8 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JljtNryBF6IC | page=301 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, [[Douglass Streusand]], a professor of [[Islamic history]] at [[Marine Corps University|Marine Corps Staff College]] in [[Virginia]], discovered that the first entry of an Internet search on the term "jihad" referred to Barney.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=6392989 | accessdate=2008-09-14 | title=The War on the Word 'Jihad' | first=Guy | last=Raz | date=30 October 2006 | work=[[All Things Considered]]| publisher=[[National Public Radio]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=="Barney = 666" joke==
One of the most widely distributed works of anti-Barney humor appeared in the 2001 book ''Science Askew,'' which determined that a phrase describing Barney contained a [[chronogram]] of the [[Book of Revelation]]'s [[Number of the Beast]], 666.&lt;ref name="SA"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ldX0FkgurzoC|accessdate=2008-08-03|title=Science Askew |author1=Simanek, Donald E |author2=Holden, John C.|isbn=9780750307147|publisher=CRC Press|year=2001|page=115}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Below is the formula of the equation:
# The character of Barney is well-described as a "cute purple dinosaur".
# The book points out how the former [[Latin alphabet]] used the letter ''V'' in place of ''U''.
# Therefore the above phrase is modified to "cvte pvrple dinosavr".
# Letters that do not represent [[Roman numerals]] are removed, leaving: "c v v l d i v"
# When the remaining numbers 100, 5, 5, 50, 500, 1, and 5 are added, the result is 666, the [[Number of the Beast]].&lt;ref name="SA"/&gt; A summary of the Antichrist calculation was included in the [http://groups.google.ca/group/alt.tv.barney/msg/0b25b206190cb6ea Barney FAQ v1.2] (posted on Usenet's alt.tv.barney newsgroup in December 1993).&lt;ref&gt;
[http://www.google.com/search?q=barney+cvte+pvrple+666 Google search]; as of 7 September 2007, this yielded 1380 results, most of which include the Barney/Antichrist Joke.&lt;/ref&gt;
# This also works with "lovable purple dinosaur".  This gives the letters "l v l v l d i v", which in turn gives 50, 5, 50, 5, 50, 500, 1, and 5, which also add up to 666.

==Computer games==
*The game ''[[Wolfenstein 3D]]'' by [[id Software]] was [[Mod (video gaming)|modded]] to replace [[Boss (video gaming)|boss]] characters with Barney.&lt;ref name="Kushner"&gt;{{cite book|title=Masters of Doom: How Two Guys Created an Empire and Transformed Pop Culture|last=Kushner|first=David|publisher=Random House Trade Paperbacks|date=2004|isbn=9780812972153}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- page 166 --&gt; Because these changes were destructive (the original [[source code]] had to be replaced for the mod to take effect), the developers separated media data from the main program when developing ''[[Doom (1993 video game)|Doom]]''.&lt;ref name="Kushner" /&gt; These were known as [[Doom WAD|WADs]], for "Where's All the Data".&lt;ref name="Kushner" /&gt; This was modded to feature Barney as one of the enemy targets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=[[PC Magazine]]|title=The PC Magazine/Ziff-Davis Interactive Shareware Awards|last=Rubenking|first=Neil J.|volume=13|issue=19|publisher=[[Ziff Davis]]|pages=314–318|date=8 November 1994|issn=0888-8507}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- page 316 --&gt;&lt;!-- list of mods listed in chapter 14 of http://www.gamers.org/docs/FAQ/doomfaq/sect3.html

*A computer game was released for [[Macintosh]] entitled ''Barney Carnage''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.macintoshgarden.org/games/barney-carnage ''Barney Carnage'']&lt;/ref&gt; One of the bosses in ''[[Monster Madness: Battle for Suburbia]]'' is a monstrous Barney parody named Mr. Huggles, who attacks by singing and attempting to hug unwilling pedestrians. After fighting him, his suit comes off, revealing a more vicious [[Jabba the Hutt]]-like being.
*In the fighting game [[M.U.G.E.N]], several fan-made characters of Barney exist, and are made to be deliberately weak so players can watch other characters, such as Godzilla, fight and defeat him effortlessly.&lt;ref&gt;{{YouTube|lXeSzvdDipo}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* John Dondzila wrote a [[homebrew (video games)|homebrew]] game for the [[ColecoVision]] in 1996 which involved killing Barney. Called ''Purple Dinosaur Massacre'', it was originally written for gaining sprite programming experience on the ColecoVision, but was released to the web via ClassicGaming.com in 1997 and gained some popularity among the readers of the website.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=ColecoVision.dk Homebrew Section Presents: John Dondzila |url=http://www.colecovision.dk/dondzila.htm |website=colecovision.dk |accessdate=23 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legal responses==
[[Lyons Partnership]], owners of the [[intellectual property]] rights to ''[[Barney &amp; Friends]]'', claimed that Barney spoofs represented [[Trademark infringement|trademark]] and [[copyright infringement]]. Lyons' lawyers subsequently demanded that such material be removed from the Internet. Some site owners complied after such threats,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gargaro.com/barney.html Removal of "Barney Dies" sound files, Carolyn Gargaro]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://drwho.virtadpt.net/barney-cease-and-desist.html "A children's toy could get me sued", drwho.virtadpt.net]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=SeaTime27Apr2002&gt;{{cite news | url=http://community.seattletimes.nwsource.com/archive/?date=20020427&amp;slug=ptchillingletters27 | date=27 April 2002 | publisher=The Seattle Times | title=The Parody Police: Bash Barney online; soon you've got mail | first=Sarah Lai | last=Stirland | accessdate=2008-08-03 }}&lt;/ref&gt; but American law establishes [[parody]] as a [[fair use]] defense against such infringement claims.

===''Barney vs. The San Diego Chicken''===
In 1994, [[Sketch comedy|comedy sketches]] of [[The San Diego Chicken]] during professional sporting events began to include scenes of the Chicken beating up a dinosaur character. Lyons Partnership began sending letters to Ted Giannoulas, who portrays the Chicken, demanding that he stop the alleged violation of Lyons' rights on the Barney character.

These threats did not stop the mock battles between the Chicken and Barney. On 8 October 1997, Lyons filed lawsuit in [[Fort Worth, Texas]] federal district court against Giannoulas, claiming copyright and trademark infringement and further claiming that such performances would confuse children. In his case, Giannoulas cited that the purple dino was a "symbol of what is wrong with our society--an homage, if you will, to all the inane, banal platitudes that we readily accept and thrust unthinkingly upon our children", that his qualities are "insipid and corny", and that he also explains that, in an article posted in a 1997 issue of ''[[The New Yorker]]'', he argues that at least some perceive Barney as a "pot-bellied," "sloppily fat" dinosaur who "giggle[s] compulsively in a tone of unequaled feeble-mindedness" and "jiggles his lumpish body like an overripe [[eggplant]]."  This court agreed with Giannoulas, and ruled against Lyons on 29 July 1998, declaring the sketches to be a parody that did not infringe on the rights of the character that Lyons created.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.current.org/ch/ch814b.html Current.org: "The case of Barney v. Chicken", articles from 1997 and 1998] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060523050923/http://www.current.org/ch/ch814b.html |date=2006-05-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/News/Court/1197.barney.html |title=E!

Lyons appealed this ruling to the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit|Fifth Circuit Court of Appeals]], but again lost their case to Giannoulas on July 7, 1999.&lt;ref&gt;[https://caselaw.findlaw.com/us-5th-circuit/1437277.html FindLaw: 5th Circuit decision, Lyons Partnership vs Ted Giannoulas]&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Barney vs. EFF''===
The [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] hosted online archives from the Computer Underground Digest that contained Barney parody material. In 2001, Gibney, Anthony &amp; Flaherty, LLP, lawyers for Lyons Partnership, issued a threat letter to
EFF claiming infringement of the Barney character. EFF strongly defended itself against these claims citing the established defence of parody, backed by [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution|United States First Amendment]] protections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.eff.org/Censorship/SLAPP/IP_SLAPP/20010706_eff_barney_response.html |title=EFF Response to "Barney" Legal Threat |accessdate=2002-09-17 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20020917044706/http://www.eff.org/Censorship/SLAPP/IP_SLAPP/20010706_eff_barney_response.html |archivedate=2002-09-17 |df= }}, [[Electronic Frontier Foundation]] letter, 6 July 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

{{As of|2006|11|29}}, the EFF successfully defended an anti-Barney website from a lawsuit. An article in British publication ''[[The Register]]'' applauded the victory.&lt;ref&gt;(2006-11-29). "[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2006/11/29/barney_goes_down_hard/ EFF defeats Barney the Dinosaur]". ''[[The Register]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Barney vs. CyberCheeze''===
Around 2001, [[Olympia, Washington]]-based comedy website CyberCheeze&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cybercheeze.com/humor/list/31.html |title=Original articles on cybercheeze.com |accessdate=2001-02-15 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20010215213318/http://www.cybercheeze.com/humor/list/31.html |archivedate=2001-02-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; posted a work entitled ''"150 Ways to Kill the Purple Dinosaur."'' Lyons threatened legal action in response, and CyberCheeze replied on their site that the threat was ''"about as intellectual as the purple quivering mass of gyrating goo you call Barney, but that it also is demeaning to everyone that visits our website and reads this worthless attempt and scare tactic."''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theregister.co.uk/2001/06/22/barney_barney_makes_dino_outfit/ ''The Register'': "Barney barney makes dino outfit purple with rage"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/news/digiwood/0,1412,44998,00.html Wired News: "Lawyers: Keep Barney Pure"], includes reference to the EFF situation.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Antoine Marie Joseph Artaud''', better known as '''Antonin Artaud''' ({{IPA-fr|aʁto|lang}}; 4 September 1896 – 4 March 1948), was a French [[dramatist]], [[poet]], [[essayist]], [[actor]], and [[theatre director]], widely recognized as one of the major figures of [[twentieth-century theatre]] and the  European [[avant-garde]].&lt;ref name="Poetry Foundation"&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.poetryfoundation.org/bio/antonin-artaud |publisher= Poetry Foundation |title= Antonin Artaud| website= poetryfoundation.org| date= | access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= EncycBrit&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| url= http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/36724/Antonin-Artaud | work= [[Encyclopedia Britannica]]| title= Antonin Artaud| date=1948-03-04| edition= | year= | page= | volume= | via= britannica.com| access-date= 2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name= Escholar&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.escholar.manchester.ac.uk/uk-ac-man-scw:1m2969| title= Antonin Artaud and the Avant-Garde Theatre| last= Gadoffre| first= G.

== Early life ==
Antonin Artaud was born on the 4th of September 1896 in [[Marseille]], France, to Euphrasie Nalpas and Antoine-Roi Artaud.&lt;ref name= authors&gt;{{cite book| first= John| last= Wakeman| title= World Authors, 1950–1970: A Companion Volume to Twentieth Century Authors| publisher= Wilson | year= 1975 | isbn= 9780824204198}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both his parents were natives of [[Smyrna]] (modern-day [[İzmir]]), and he was greatly affected by his [[Greek people|Greek]] ancestry.&lt;ref name= authors /&gt; Antoine-Roi Artaud was a shipowner.&lt;ref name= Escholar /&gt; Euphrasie gave birth to nine children, but four were stillborn and two others died in childhood. Antonin contracted [[meningitis]] at age four. At the time the disease had no cure, but after a long struggle including a comatose period, a severely weakened Antonin survived.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Arana|first1=R.

Artaud's parents arranged a long series of [[sanatorium]] stays for their temperamental son, which were both prolonged and expensive. This lasted five years, with a break of two months in June and July 1916, when Artaud was [[conscription|conscripted]] into the [[French Army]]. He was discharged due to addiction to laudanum and mental instability. During Artaud's "rest cures" at the sanatorium, he read [[Arthur Rimbaud]], [[Charles Baudelaire]], and [[Edgar Allan Poe]]. In May 1919, the director of the sanatorium prescribed [[laudanum]] for Artaud, precipitating a lifelong addiction to that and other [[opiate]]s.&lt;ref name="Antonin Marie Joseph Artaud"&gt;{{cite web |last1= Morfee|first1=Adrian|title=Antonin Marie Joseph Artaud|url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CH1200010684&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=csunorthridge&amp;it=r&amp;p=LitRC&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=ca041aa318b4b8e9fe8d56620a267715|website=Literature Resource Center|publisher=Modern French Poets|accessdate=12 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Antoine suffered a [[nervous breakdown]] at age 19; this was not the end of his mental illness.&lt;ref name= Escholar /&gt;

== Career ==
In March 1921, Artaud moved to Paris to pursue a career as a writer (against his father's wishes)&lt;ref name= Escholar /&gt; and instead discovered he had a talent for [[avant-garde]] theatre. While training and performing with directors including [[Charles Dullin]] and [[Georges Pitoëff|Georges Pitoeff]], he continued to write both poetry and essays. At the age of 27, he mailed some of his poems to the journal ''[[La Nouvelle Revue Française]]''; they were rejected, but the editor, [[Jacques Rivière]], wrote back seeking to understand him, and a relationship via letters developed. Their compilation into an [[Epistolary novel|epistolary]] work, ''Correspondance avec Jacques Rivière'', was Artaud's first major publication.

Artaud cultivated a great interest in [[film|cinema]] as well, writing the scenario for the first surrealist film, ''[[The Seashell and the Clergyman]]'' (1928), directed by [[Germaine Dulac]]. This film influenced [[Salvador Dalí]] and [[Luis Buñuel]], two key Spanish surrealists, when they made ''[[Un Chien Andalou]]'' (1929). Artaud's performance as [[Jean-Paul Marat]] in [[Abel Gance]]'s [[Napoléon (1927 film)|''Napoleon'']] (1927) used exaggerated movements to convey the fire of Marat's personality. He also played the monk Massieu in [[Carl Theodor Dreyer]]'s ''[[The Passion of Joan of Arc]]'' (1928).

In 1926–28, Artaud ran the [[Alfred Jarry]] Theatre, along with [[Roger Vitrac]]. He produced and directed original works by Vitrac, as well as pieces by [[Paul Claudel|Claudel]] and [[Strindberg]]. The theatre advertised that they would produce Artaud's play ''[[Jet de sang]]'' in their 1926–1927 season, but it was never mounted and was not premiered until 40 years later. The Theatre was extremely short-lived, but was attended by an enormous range of European artists, including [[André Gide]], [[Arthur Adamov]], and [[Paul Valéry]].

In 1931, Artaud saw [[Balinese dance]] performed at the [[Paris Colonial Exposition]]. Although he did not fully understand the intentions and ideas behind traditional Balinese performance, it influenced many of his ideas for theatre. Also during this year, Artaud's ''First Manifesto for a Theatre of Cruelty'' was published in ''[[La Nouvelle Revue Française]]''; it would later appear as a chapter in ''[[The Theatre and Its Double]]''. In 1935, Artaud's production of his adaptation of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley|Shelley]]'s ''[[The Cenci]]'' premiered. ''Les Censi'' was a commercial failure, although it employed innovative sound effects-including the first theatrical use of the electronic instrument the [[Ondes Martenot]]—and had a set designed by [[Balthus]].

After the production failed, Artaud received a grant to travel to [[Mexico]], where in 1936 he met his first [[Mexican people|Mexican]]-Parisian friend, the painter [[Federico Cantú]], when Cantú gave lectures on the decadence of Western civilization. Artaud also studied and lived with the [[Tarahumara|Tarahumaran people]] and experimented with [[peyote]], recording his experiences, which were later released in a volume called ''Voyage to the Land of the Tarahumara''. (In 1976, an English translation was published under the title ''The Peyote Dance''.) The content of this work closely resembles the poems of his later days, concerned primarily with the [[supernatural]]. Artaud also recorded his horrific withdrawal from [[heroin]] upon entering the land of the Tarahumaras. Having deserted his last supply of the drug at a mountainside, he literally had to be hoisted onto his horse and soon resembled, in his words, "a giant, inflamed gum". Artaud would return to opiates later in life.

In 1937, Artaud returned to France, where he obtained a walking stick of knotted wood that he believed belonged not only to [[St. Patrick]], but also [[Lucifer]] and [[Jesus Christ]]. Artaud traveled to Ireland, landing at [[Cobh]] and travelling to [[Galway]] in an effort to return the staff, though speaking very little English, and no Irish whatsoever, he was unable to make himself understood. He would not have been admitted at Cobh, according to Irish government documents, except that he carried a letter of introduction from the Paris embassy. Most of his trip was spent in a hotel room he was unable to pay for. He was forcibly removed from the grounds of Milltown House, a [[Jesuit]] community, when he refused to leave. Before deportation he was briefly confined in the notorious [[Mountjoy Prison]]. According to Irish Government papers he was deported as "a destitute and undesirable alien".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thedublinreview.com/extracts-from-the-artaud-file/ |accessdate= 2012-06-28 |deadurl=yes |work= [[The Dublin Review]] | title= ‘An absent-minded person of the student type’: Extracts from the Artaud file| first= Antonin| last= Artaud| archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20140413140545/http://thedublinreview.com/extracts-from-the-artaud-file/ |archivedate= 2014-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; On his return trip by ship, Artaud believed he was being attacked by two crew members, and he retaliated. He was arrested and put in a [[straitjacket]].

His best-known work, ''The Theatre and Its Double'', was published in 1938. This book contained the two manifestos of the [[Theatre of Cruelty]]. There, "he proposed a theatre that was in effect a return to magic and ritual and he sought to create a new theatrical language of totem and gesture – a language of space devoid of dialogue that would appeal to all the senses."&lt;ref name= GBotting&gt;{{cite book| first= Gary| last= Botting| authorlink= Gary Botting| title= The Theatre of Protest in America| place= Edmonton| publisher= Harden House| year= 1972}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|6}} "Words say little to the mind," Artaud wrote, "compared to space thundering with images and crammed with sounds." He proposed "a theatre in which violent physical images crush and hypnotize the sensibility of the spectator seized by the theatre as by a whirlwind of higher forces." He considered formal theatres with their proscenium arches and playwrights with their scripts "a hindrance to the magic of genuine ritual."&lt;ref name= GBotting /&gt;{{rp|6}}

===Medical hiatus===
His return from Ireland brought about the beginning of the final phase of Artaud's life, which was spent in different asylums. When France was occupied by the [[Nazism|Nazis]], friends of Artaud had him transferred to the [[psychiatric hospital]] in [[Rodez]], well inside [[Vichy France|Vichy]] territory, where he was put under the charge of Dr. [[Gaston Ferdière]]. Ferdière began administering [[Electroconvulsive therapy|electroshock treatments]] to eliminate Artaud's symptoms, which included various delusions and odd physical tics. The doctor believed that Artaud's habits of crafting magic spells, creating [[astrology]] charts, and drawing disturbing images were symptoms of [[mental illness]]. Artaud, at his peak tried to commit even more harm from his insanity by lashing out at others. The electroshock treatments created much controversy, although it was during these treatments—in conjunction with Ferdière's [[art therapy]]—that Artaud began writing and drawing again, after a long dormant period. In 1946, Ferdière released Artaud to his friends, in which placed him in the psychiatric clinic at [[Ivry-sur-Seine]].&lt;ref name="Antonin Marie Joseph Artaud"/&gt;

===Career resumed===
Artaud was encouraged to write by his friends, and interest in his work was rekindled. He visited an exhibition of works by [[Vincent van Gogh]] which resulted in a study ''Van Gogh le suicidé de la société'' [''Van Gogh, The Man Suicided by Society''], published by K éditeur, Paris, 1947 which won a critics' prize.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url= http://www.artseensoho.com/Life/readings/artaud.html |title=Antonin Artaud, from "Van Gogh: the Man Suicided by Society" |publisher=ARTseenSOHO |date= |accessdate= 2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; He recorded ''{{lang|fr|Pour en Finir avec le Jugement de dieu}}'' [''To Have Done With the Judgment of God''] between 22 and 29 November 1947. This work was shelved by Wladimir Porché, the director of the French Radio, the day before its scheduled airing on 2 February 1948. The performance was prohibited partially as a result of its [[scatology|scatological]], [[anti-American]], and [[anti-religion|anti-religious]] references and pronouncements, but also because of its general randomness, with a cacophony of [[xylophone|xylophonic]] sounds mixed with various [[percussion|percussive]] elements. While remaining true to his Theatre of Cruelty and reducing powerful emotions and expressions into audible sounds, Artaud had utilized various, somewhat alarming cries, screams, grunts, [[onomatopoeia]], and [[glossolalia]].

As a result, Fernand Pouey, the director of dramatic and literary broadcasts for French radio, assembled a panel to consider the broadcast of ''{{lang|fr|Pour en Finir avec le Jugement de dieu.}}'' Among the approximately 50 artists, writers, musicians, and journalists present for a private listening on 5 February 1948 were [[Jean Cocteau]], [[Paul Éluard]], [[Raymond Queneau]], [[Jean-Louis Barrault]], [[René Clair]], [[Jean Paulhan]], [[Maurice Nadeau]], [[Georges Auric]], [[Claude Mauriac]], and [[René Char]]. Although the panel felt almost unanimously in favor of Artaud's work, Porché refused to allow the broadcast. Pouey left his job and the show was not heard again until 23 February 1948 at a private performance at the Théâtre Washington.

==Final years==
In January 1948, Artaud was diagnosed with [[colorectal cancer]]. He died shortly afterwards on 4 March 1948, alone in a psychiatric clinic, at the foot of his bed, clutching his shoe. It was suspected that he died from a lethal dose of the drug [[chloral hydrate]], although it is unknown whether he was aware of its lethality. The clinic is located in Ivry-Sur-Seine, which is a commune in the southeastern suburbs of Paris.

Thirty years later, French radio finally broadcast the performance of ''{{lang|fr|Pour en Finir avec le Jugement de dieu.}}''

== Apprenticeship with Charles Dullin ==
Arguably one of Artaud's most significant influences in shaping his radical ideas for the theater was [[Charles Dullin]].  Dullin, a cohort and collaborator of the celebrated French "teacher-directors" [[Jacques Copeau]], [[André Antoine]], and [[Théâtre National Populaire|Firmin Gémier]], founded in July 1921 what he referred to as a "laboratory theater" which he named "Théâtre de l'Atelier", located in Néronville, France.  Dullin's goal when he created this theater, where he trained aspiring actors, was to create the "complete actor",
"to form actors with a general culture, which they so often lack; to inculcate them from the very beginning with solid principles of actors’ techniques: good diction, physical training; to expand their means of expression to include dance and pantomime; in one word, to form the complete actor."&lt;ref name= FD77&gt;{{cite journal| last= Deák| first= František| title= Antonin Artaud and Charles Dullin: Artaud's Apprenticeship in Theatre| work= Educational Theatre Journal| volume= 29| number= 3| date= October 1977| publisher= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|346}}

Artaud was taken on as an apprentice by Dullin in 1921, under whom he arduously trained for eighteen months, ten to twelve hours a day, with particular emphasis on mime, gymnastics, improvisation, voice production, and various exercises intended to heighten one’s sensory perception.&lt;ref name=Goodall&gt;{{cite journal| last= Goodall| first= Jane| title= Artaud’s Revision of Shelley’s ''The Cenci'': The Text and its Double| work= Comparative Drama| pages= 115–126 | volume= 21| number= 2| date= Summer 1987}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|119}}  By making contact with one’s surroundings, the actor was to get in tune with "La Voix du Monde" (the voice of the world), making way for "Voix de Soi-Même" (the voice of oneself), in order to be able to get the actor in tune with his true voice, with which he is to express himself on stage.  Perhaps the most evident influence that Dullin had on Artaud's 1935 stage production of [[Percy Bysshe Shelley]]’s ''[[The Cenci]]'' were his improvisational exercises related to the five human senses, intended by Dullin as preparation, not for the stage.  In his seminars, Dullin strongly emphasized that his actors must "see before describing, hear before answering...and feel before trying to express himself", often using bells, the sound of footsteps, and masks as preparation.&lt;ref name= FD77 /&gt;{{rp|347}}

The actors were encouraged to forget the weight of their bodies, while using them more than their faces to express themselves, often wearing a full or half mask.&lt;ref name= FD77 /&gt;{{rp|347}} It was this internalization process that interested Artaud most, often focusing on man's struggle against elemental forces, a significant theme in his Theatre of Cruelty and the 1935 staging of ''The Cenci''. Dullin recorded an exercise he gave to Artaud in which he was to mime his struggle against the currents of a river.&lt;ref name=Goodall /&gt;{{rp|119}} Artaud was quoted as saying of Dullin, "Hearing Dullin teach I feel that I’m rediscovering ancient secrets and a whole forgotten mystique of production".&lt;ref name= FD77 /&gt;{{rp|351}}

In Artaud's Theatre of Cruelty, he warned against the dangers of psychology in theater and strove to create a theater in which the [[Mise en scène|mise-en-scène]], everything present in the staging of a production, could be understood as a codified stage language, with minimal emphasis on spoken language.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| last= Artaud| first= Antonin| title= Das Theater und sein Double| language= German| location= Frankfurt a.M.| publisher= Fischer| year= 1986| page= 88}}&lt;/ref&gt; He voiced his concerns of the dangers relating to "psychological equilibrium" present in Dullin's vocal improvisation exercises, "These exercises of improvisation reveal and sharpen true personality. Intonation is found within oneself and pushed out with the burning power of feeling, not achieved through imitation".&lt;ref name= FD77 /&gt;{{rp|349–350}} In his 1935 production of ''The Cenci'', it was these raw elemental forces and his wishes for the audience to feel the character's anguish that Artaud focused on.

The drama written by Percy Shelley contained themes of abuse, incest, violence, murder and betrayal. In Artaud's stage directions, he described the opening scene as "suggestive of extreme atmospheric turbulence, with wind-blown drapes, waves of suddenly amplified sound, and crowds of figures engaged in ‘furious orgy’", accompanied by "a chorus of church bells", as well as the presence of numerous large mannequins.&lt;ref name=Goodall /&gt;{{rp|120}} In this scene, which is often referred to as "the banquet scene", Dullin's influence on Artaud is very clear, as both the sounds of bells and the sounds of amplified footsteps were present, along with the strongly emphasized theme of elemental forces.  While Shelley's version of ''The Cenci'' conveyed the motivations and anguish of the Cenci's daughter Beatrice with her father through monologues, Artaud was much more concerned with conveying the menacing nature of the Cenci's presence and the reverberations of their incest relationship though physical discordance, as if an invisible "force-field" surrounded them.&lt;ref name=Goodall /&gt;{{rp|123}}

While Artaud implemented much of what he learned from his apprenticeship with Charles Dullin, the two butted heads towards the end of Artaud's apprenticeship, citing differences in their goals for the theater. [[Lugné-Poe|Lugné Poe]], influential French theater director in the symbolist movement, described Artaud as "a painter lost in the midst of actors".&lt;ref name= FD77 /&gt;{{rp|350}} Artaud's strong interest in oriental theater, specifically Balinese and Chinese, was in part shared by his mentor Dullin, but Dullin, unlike Artaud, did not think Western theater should be adopting oriental language and style. He was quoted as saying of Artaud's influences from oriental theater, "To want to impose on our Western theater rules of a theatre of a long tradition which has its own symbolic language would be a great mistake."&lt;ref name= FD77 /&gt;{{rp|351}} Artaud's wishes that Western theatre be much more resembling of Oriental theatre was a major source of conflict between the two French actors/directors.  Artaud's implementation of Dullin's sensory awareness exercises into the stage production were clearly observable in ''The Cenci'', Jane Goodall writes of the performance,

{{quote|The predominance of action over reflection accelerates the development of events...the monologues...are cut in favor of sudden, jarring transitions...so that a spasmodic effect is created. Extreme fluctuations in pace, pitch, and tone heighten sensory awareness intensify...the here and now of performance.|Jane Goodall&lt;ref name= Goodall /&gt;{{rp|119}} }}

Artaud's implementation of Dullins preparation techniques, not intended for the stage, in combination with the physical and symbolic language specific to oriental theater were Artaud's strongest influences in both the shaping of The Theater of Cruelty and his staging of ''The Cenci''.

== Theatre of Cruelty ==
''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' describe his Theatre of Cruelty as "a not very good primitive ceremonial experience intended to liberate the human subconscious and reveal man to himself", and go on to say that ''Manifeste du théâtre de la cruauté'' (1932; ''Manifesto of the Theatre of Cruelty'') and ''Le Théâtre et son double'' (1938; ''The Theatre and Its Double'') both called for "communion between actor and audience in a magic exorcism; gestures, sounds, unusual scenery, and lighting combine to form a language, superior to words, that can be used to subvert thought and logic and to shock the spectator into seeing the baseness of his world."&lt;ref name="EncycBrit" /&gt;

In ''[[Theatre and its Double|The Theatre and Its Double]]'', Artaud expressed his admiration for [[Eastern world|Eastern]] forms of theatre, particularly the [[Bali]]nese. He admired Eastern theatre because of the codified, highly ritualized and precise physicality of Balinese dance performance, and advocated what he called a "[[Theatre of Cruelty]]". At one point, he stated that by [[cruelty]] he meant not exclusively [[Sadism and Masochism|sadism]] or causing pain, but just as often a violent, physical determination to shatter the false [[reality]]. He believed that text had been a tyrant over meaning, and advocated, instead, for a theatre made up of a unique language, halfway between thought and gesture. Artaud described the spiritual in physical terms, and believed that all theatre is physical expression in space.

{{quote|The Theatre of Cruelty has been created in order to restore to the theatre a passionate and convulsive conception of life, and it is in this sense of violent rigour and extreme condensation of scenic elements that the cruelty on which it is based must be understood. This cruelty, which will be bloody when necessary but not systematically so, can thus be identified with a kind of severe moral purity which is not afraid to pay life the price it must be paid.|Antonin Artaud, ''The Theatre of Cruelty'', in ''The Theory of the Modern Stage'' (ed. Eric Bentley), Penguin, 1968, p.66}}

Evidently, Artaud's various uses of the term cruelty must be examined to fully understand his ideas. [[Lee Jamieson]] has identified four ways in which Artaud used the term cruelty. First, it is employed metaphorically to describe the essence of human existence.

{{quote|[Nietzsche's] definition of cruelty informs Artaud's own, declaring that all art embodies and intensifies the underlying brutalities of life to recreate the thrill of experience ... Although Artaud did not formally cite Nietzsche, [their writing] contains a familiar persuasive authority, a similar exuberant phraseology, and motifs in extremis ...|[[Lee Jamieson]], ''Antonin Artaud: From Theory to Practice'', Greenwich Exchange, 2007, p.21-22}}

Artaud's second use of the term (according to Jamieson), is as a form of discipline. Although Artaud wanted to "reject form and incite chaos" (Jamieson, p.&amp;nbsp;22), he also promoted strict discipline and rigor in his performance techniques. A third use of the term was ‘cruelty as theatrical presentation’. The Theatre of Cruelty aimed to hurl the spectator into the centre of the action, forcing them to engage with the performance on an instinctive level. For Artaud, this was a cruel, yet necessary act upon the spectator, designed to shock them out of their complacency:

{{quote|Artaud sought to remove [[aesthetic distance]], bringing the audience into direct contact with the dangers of life. By turning theatre into a place where the spectator is exposed rather than protected, Artaud was committing an act of cruelty upon them.|[[Lee Jamieson]], ''Antonin Artaud: From Theory to Practice'', Greenwich Exchange, 2007, p.23}}

Artaud wanted to put the audience in the middle of the 'spectacle' (his term for the play), so they would be 'engulfed and physically affected by it'. He referred to this layout as being like a 'vortex' – a constantly shifting shape – 'to be trapped and powerless'. He also placed a great emphasis on sound rather than words or dialogue, by incorporating loud cries, screams, eerie sounds, or noises causing the audience to become uncomfortable. Words were an insufficient medium of expression.

Finally, Artaud used the term to describe his philosophical views, which will be outlined in the following section.
In 1989 Norwegian actor-turned-director [[Lars Øyno]] made the performance of "Elagabal" with his colleagues at Trondelag Teatre in [[Trondheim, Norway]]. That led to the foundation of Grusomhetens Teater in [[Oslo]] in 1992. Using Artaud's manifestos as sources for a contemporary practice on stage, he made 23 plays in the theater of cruelty form. Øyno traveled in countries like India, Russia, Germany, Poland, UK, US, etc. A resurrection of the Theater of Cruelty attracted drama festivals in different countries. Yet Grusomhetens Teater is the one and only troupe in the world dedicated completely to Artaud's principles of theater.
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.grusomhetensteater.no |title=Grusomhetens Teater &amp;#124; |publisher=Grusomhetensteater.no |date= |accessdate=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

To him, reality appeared to be a consensus, the same consensus the audience accepts when they enter a theatre to see a play and, for a time, pretend that what they are seeing is real.

Artaud saw suffering as essential to existence and thus rejected all [[utopia]]s as inevitable [[dystopia]]. He denounced the degradation of civilization, yearned for cosmic purification, and called for an ecstatic loss of the self. Hence Jane Goodall considers Artaud to be a modern [[Gnostic]] while Ulli Seegers stresses the [[Hermeticism|Hermetic]] elements in his works.

A very important study on the Artaud work comes from [[Jacques Derrida]]. According to the philosopher, as theatrical writer and actor, Artaud is the embodiment of both an aggressive and repairing gesture, which strikes, sounds out, is harsh in a dramatic way and with critical determination as well. Identifying life as art, he was critically focused on the western cultural social drama, to point out and deny the double-dealing on which the western theatrical tradition is based; he worked with the whirlpool of feelings and lunatic expressions, being subjugated to a counter-force which came from the act of gesture.&lt;ref name=JEM7&gt;{{cite book

Artaud was heavily influenced by seeing a Colonial Exposition of Balinese Theatre in Marseille. He read eclectically, inspired by authors and artists such as [[Seneca the Younger|Seneca]], [[Shakespeare]], [[Edgar Allan Poe|Poe]], [[Lautréamont]], [[Alfred Jarry]], and [[André Masson]].

== Influence ==
Artaud has been cited as a profoundly influential figure in the history of theater, [[avant-garde art]], literature, and other disciplines.&lt;ref name= EncycBrit /&gt; His work proved to be a significant influence on the [[Theater of the Absurd]], particularly the works of [[Jean Genet]] and [[Samuel Beckett]], and helped inspire a movement away from the dominant role of language and rationalism in contemporary theater.&lt;ref name= EncycBrit /&gt; Artaud also had a significant influence on the philosophers [[Gilles Deleuze]] and [[Félix Guattari]], who borrowed Artaud's phrase "the body without organs" to describe [[Body without organs|their conception]] of the virtual dimension of the body and, ultimately, the basic substratum of reality in their ''[[Capitalism and Schizophrenia]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Deleuze, Gilles and Félix Guattari. "28 November 1947: How Do You Make Yourself a Body Without Organs?" In ''A Thousand Plateaus: Capitalism and Schizophrenia''. Trans. Brian Massumi. Minneapolis: University of Minnesota Press, 1987. 149–166.&lt;/ref&gt; Poet [[Allen Ginsberg]] claimed his introduction to Artaud, specifically "To Have Done with the Judgement of god", by [[Carl Solomon]] had a tremendous influence on his most famous poem "[[Howl]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| first= Allen| last= Ginsberg| title= "Howl" Original Draft Facsimile, Transcript &amp; Variant Versions, Fully Annotated by Author, with Contemporaneous Correspondence, Account of First Public Reading, Legal Skirmishes, Precursor Texts &amp; Bibliography| editor-first= Barry| editor-last= Miles| publisher= Harper Perennial| year= 1995| page= 130| isbn= 0-06-092611-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Theatrical practitioner [[Peter Brook]] took inspiration from Artaud's "Theatre of Cruelty" in a series of workshops that led up to his [[Royal Shakespeare Company]] production of ''[[Marat/Sade]]'' in 1964, which was performed in New York and Paris as well as London. The [[Living Theatre]] was also heavily influenced by Artaud, as was much English-language [[experimental theatre]] and [[performance art]]; [[Karen Finley]], [[Spalding Gray]], Liz LeCompte, [[Richard Foreman]], [[Charles Marowitz]], [[Sam Shepard]], [[Joseph Chaikin]], and more all named Artaud as one of their influences.&lt;ref name= GBotting /&gt;{{rp|6–25}}  In the winter of 1968, Williams College offered a dedicated intersession class in Artaudian theater, resulting in a week-long "Festival of Cruelty," under the direction of [[Keith Fowler]].  The Festival included productions of ''The Jet of Blood, All Writing is Pig Shit'', and several original ritualized performances, one based on the [[Charles Whitman|Texas Tower killings]] and another created as an ensemble catharsis called ''The Resurrection of Pig Man''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| title= Dark Days| work= [[Williams Record]]| place= Williamstown, Massachusetts| date= January 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Charles Marowitz's play ''Artaud at Rodez'' is about the relationship between Artaud and Dr. Ferdière during Artaud's confinement at the psychiatric hospital in Rodez; the play was first performed in 1976 at the Teatro a Trastavere in Rome.&lt;ref&gt;"Marowitz, Charles (1977).

The play told Artaud's story from his early years of aspiration when he wished to be part to the establishment, through to his final years as a suffering, iconoclastic outsider.In Canada, playwright [[Gary Botting]] created a series of Artaudian "happenings" from ''The Aeolian Stringer'' to ''Zen Rock Festival'', and produced a dozen plays with an Artaudian theme, including ''Prometheus Re-Bound''.&lt;ref&gt;Edmonton: Harden House, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; The Latin American dramatic novel ''[[Yo-Yo Boing!]]'' by [[Giannina Braschi]] includes a debate between artists and poets concerning the merits of Artaud's "multiple talents" in comparison to the singular talents of other French writers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title= Yo-Yo Boing'' by Giannina Braschi''| chapter= Introduction |first= Doris| last= Sommer| publisher= Latin American Literary Review Press| place= Pittsburgh| year= 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; The band [[Bauhaus (band)|Bauhaus]] included a song about the playwright, called "Antonin Artaud", on their album ''[[Burning from the Inside]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waste.org/bauhaus/l/antoninartaud.html |title=bauhaus:lyrics:antonin artaud |publisher=Waste.org |date= |accessdate=2016-10-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Influential [[Argentina|Argentine]] hard rock band [[Pescado Rabioso]] recorded an album titled ''[[Artaud (album)|Artaud]]''.

'''''Apano Sin''''' is a 2000 [[computer game]] for the [[Amiga]]; a top-down vertical [[Shoot 'em up#Scrolling shooters|shooter]], Apano Sin had players destroy waves of enemies through five stages, had no end-level boss battles, a two-way weapon system and offered the unique ability to have the player ship flip backwards in order to fire shots at enemies coming behind it.

==Plot==
The game takes place in the Apano System, where its human-like inhabitants have been busily exploring, colonizing and extracting resources from the planets and moons within it. The seventh planet in the system, Apano Sin, is selected to be the next colonized planet by the system's inhabitants. Everything goes well on the planet until the researchers discover water below Apano Sin's surface. Upon ingesting this water, the researchers discover it rejuvenates the body, but upon continual consumption, the subject overdoses and becomes violent and over-active. This scenario comes true as the entire staff of the Apano Sin project take over the planet and its four moons using the project's defense ships to wreak havoc upon the uninfected. The player, assuming the role of a nameless ship captain, is assigned to rid the planet of the infected staff.

'''The Association of Commercial Television in Europe (ACT)''' represents the interests of leading commercial broadcasters in 37 European countries. The ACT member companies finance, produce, promote and distribute content and services benefiting millions of Europeans across all platforms. By offering a wide range of choice and variety to the viewer, commercial broadcasters are a leading source of entertainment and information to millions of European citizens.

==History==
The ACT was set up in 1989. Back then, there were fewer than 100 broadcasters in the twelve Member States of the European Community. With the occasional exception, most European countries had only ended the state monopoly of television broadcasting in the mid-1980s. Back then, the ACT had five founder members. As commercial television models proved popular with viewers, so many new channels were launched and ACT membership grew quickly. However, some of the key regulatory issues were already becoming apparent, with European rules adopted in 1989 for the first time on transfrontier television, advertising, programme quotas, and then separate rules negotiated for copyright in the early 1990s.

==Mission==
The ACT's role is to protect and to promote the interests of the European private broadcasters. ACT engages with the European Union's institutions to achieve a balanced and appropriate regulatory framework which will encourage further investment and growth in the audiovisual sector. This will allow the commercial audiovisual industry to continue to get high-quality content to viewers.
In more detail, ACT monitors policy developments at European level and provides its members with regulatory expertise. ACT also engages with European decision makers and engages in a constant dialogue while providing them with the first-hand expertise about the audiovisual sector. Furthermore, ACT is a leading platform for its members to network and exchange ideas about latest policy developments and best practices. Last but not least, ACT represents the industry at external public events, institutional working groups, European and international organisations.

==EU Media Policy==
The ACT promotes and advocates the interests of its member companies in a wide range of media policy issues at European level. ACT activities aim at a balanced and appropriate regulatory framework which will encourage further investment and growth in the audiovisual sector. 
ACT responds to relevant consultations, inquiries and maintains dialogue with the European institutions. Current key policy issues are the following:
* Audiovisual Media Services 
* Accessibility
* Portability
* Copyright Package
* Digital Contracts 
* e-Privacy
* Intellectual Property Rights

The film was given a [[limited release]] by [[New Line Cinema]] during the fall of 2000, and was released on [[DVD]] the following year. Critical reception was mixed, and the film was a [[box office bomb]].

==Plot==
Pierre Delacroix (real name Peerless Dothan) is an uptight, [[Harvard University|Harvard]]-educated African-American man in the employment of television network CNS. At work, he endures torment from his boss Thomas Dunwitty, a tactless, boorish white man. Not only does Dunwitty use [[AAVE]] and the word "[[nigger]]" repeatedly in conversations, he also proudly proclaims that he is more black than Delacroix and that he can use "nigger" since he is [[interracial marriage|married to a colored woman]] and has two mixed-race children. Dunwitty frequently rejects Delacroix's scripts for series that portray black people in positive, intelligent scenarios, dismissing them as "[[The Cosby Show|Cosby clones]]".

In an effort to escape his contract through being fired, Delacroix develops a [[minstrel show]] with the help of his personal assistant Sloane Hopkins. ''Mantan: The New Millennium Minstrel Show'' features black actors in [[blackface]], extremely racist jokes and puns, and offensively stereotyped [[Computer-generated imagery|CGI]]-animated cartoons. Delacroix and Hopkins recruit two impoverished street performers, Manray and Womack, to star in the show. While Womack is horrified when Delacroix tells him details about the show, Manray sees it as his big chance to become rich and famous for his tap-dancing skills.

To Delacroix's horror, not only does Dunwitty enthusiastically endorse the show, it also becomes hugely successful. As soon as it premieres, Manray and Womack become big stars, while Delacroix, contrary to his original stated intent, defends the show as [[satire]]. Delacroix quickly embraces the fame and recognition he receives while Hopkins becomes ashamed of her association with it. Meanwhile, an underground, militant [[rap music|rap]] group called the [[Mau Mau Uprising|Mau Maus]], led by Hopkins' older brother Julius, becomes increasingly angry at the show's content. Though they had earlier unsuccessfully auditioned for the program's live band position, the group plans to end the show using violence.

Womack quits, fed up with the show and Manray's increasing [[megalomania|ego]]. Manray and Hopkins grow closer, despite Delacroix's attempts to sabotage their relationship. Delacroix confronts Hopkins, and when she lashes back at him, he fires her. She then shows him a videotaped [[montage (filmmaking)|montage]] she created of racist footage culled from assorted media to shame Delacroix into stopping production of the show, but he refuses to watch it. After an argument with Delacroix, Manray realizes he is being exploited and defiantly announces that he will no longer wear blackface. He appears in front of the studio audience, who are all in blackface, and does his dance number in his regular clothing. The network executives immediately turn against Manray, and Dunwitty fires him.

The Mau Maus kidnap Manray and announce his public execution via live [[webcast]]. The authorities work feverishly to track down the source of the internet feed, but Manray is nevertheless assassinated while doing his famous tap dancing. At his office, Delacroix (now in blackface himself, mourning Manray's death) fantasizes that the various black-themed antique collectibles in his office are staring him down and coming to life; in a rage, he destroys many of the items. The police kill all the members of the Mau Maus except for One-Sixteenth Blak, a white member who demands to die with the others.

Furious, Hopkins confronts Delacroix at gunpoint and demands that he play her tape. As he does so, Hopkins reminds him of the lives that were ruined because of his actions. During a struggle over the gun, Delacroix is shot in the stomach. Hopkins flees while proclaiming that it was Delacroix's own fault that he got shot. Delacroix, holding the gun in his hands to make his wound appear self-inflicted, watches the tape as he lies dying on the floor. The film concludes with a long montage of racially insensitive and demeaning clips of African-American characters from [[Hollywood]] films of the first half of the 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;Some of the films used in the sequence are ''[[The Birth of a Nation]]'', ''[[The Jazz Singer]]'', ''[[Gone with the Wind (film)|Gone with the Wind]]'', ''[[Babes in Arms (film)|Babes in Arms]]'', ''[[Holiday Inn (film)|Holiday Inn]]'', ''[[Judge Priest]], ''[[Ub Iwerks]]' cartoon ''[[Little Black Sambo]]'', [[Walter Lantz]]'s cartoon ''[[Scrub Me Mama with a Boogie Beat]]'', the ''[[Screen Songs]]'' short ''Jingle Jangle Jungle'', the [[Merrie Melodies]] short ''[[All This and Rabbit Stew]]'', and, from the [[Hal Roach]] comedy ''School's Out'', ''[[Our Gang]]'' kids [[Allen "Farina" Hoskins]] and [[Matthew "Stymie" Beard]].&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Manray is shown doing his last ''Mantan'' sequence on stage.

==Production==
Most of the film was shot on [[Mini DV]] [[digital video]] using the [[Sony]] VX 1000 camera, and later converted to film format.&lt;ref name="LeeCommentary" /&gt; This kept the budget limited to $10 million and allowed the use of multiple cameras to simultaneously capture masters, two-shots and close-ups to save time.&lt;ref name="LeeCommentary" /&gt; The ''Mantan: New Millenium Minstrel Show'' sequences, and their sponsor ads, were shot on [[16 mm film|Super 16]] film stock.&lt;ref name="LeeCommentary"&gt;[[Spike Lee|Lee, Spike]] (2001). Audio commentary for ''Bamboozled''. New Line Home Entertainment.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Soundtrack==
{{main|Bamboozled (soundtrack)}}
The [[soundtrack album]] for the film was released September 26, 2000 by [[Motown Records]]. The album consisted of [[hip hop]] and contemporary [[R&amp;B]], and was [[India.Arie]]'s first time on an album, with six singles.

[[Roger Ebert]] gave the film 2 stars out of a possible 4, writing that the film was "perplexing," raising important issues but handling them poorly. "The film is a satirical attack on the way TV uses and misuses African-American images, but many viewers will leave the theater thinking Lee has misused them himself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/bamboozled-2000|title=Bamboozled Movie Review &amp; Film Summary (2000) - Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|website=www.rogerebert.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Battletoads Arcade''''', also known as '''''Super Battletoads''''' or just '''''Battletoads''''', is a 1994 [[scrolling beat 'em up]] [[arcade game]] in the ''[[Battletoads]]'' series developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]] and published by [[Electronic Arts]]. Up to three players, as the Battletoads, brawl aliens and mutant rodents through six [[Level (video gaming)|levels]] to save the universe from the [[Dark Queen (Battletoads)|Dark Queen]]. The game also includes vertical and [[bonus level]]s. Each Toad has its own signature attack, and as customary for the series, players can knock enemies towards the screen, [[fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]].

Rare took greater liberties with violence and gore in ''Battletoads Arcade'' since the product was not destined for home consoles. It was Rare's first game to use the 3D graphics technology later popularized in ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]'' and ''[[Killer Instinct (1994 video game)|Killer Instinct]]''. Although the game [[playtest]]ed well and appeared to be financially viable, the publisher hesitated to release it. The game proved unsuccessful in the arcades and its in-production [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] and [[Game Boy]] [[Porting of video games|ports]] were canceled despite the latter being reportedly completed [http://www.rarefandabase.com/exclusive-an-interview-with-rares-paul-machacek/]. They were going to be rebranded as '''''Super Battletoads''''' [https://twitter.com/Paul_Mach1/status/694515060778090496]. Retrospective reviews were more positive--''[[Retro Gamer]]'' even declared it the best of the series. ''Battletoads Arcade'' received its console debut when it was [[Video game console emulator|emulated]] in the 2015 ''[[Rare Replay]]'', a compilation of games from Rare's history for the [[Xbox One]]. ''Rare Replay'' reviewers were surprised by the quality of the arcade game and some considered it a highlight of the package. ''Battletoads Arcade'' currently remains the last released entry in the ''Battletoads'' series.

== Gameplay ==

[[File:Battletoads arcade.png|thumb|left|A player decapitates three rat foes]]

''Battletoads Arcade'' is a coin-operated, [[scrolling beat 'em up]] [[arcade video game]].&lt;ref name="IGN: retrospective"/&gt; Up to three players, as the ''[[Battletoads]]'' ([[Battletoads (characters)|Rash, Pimple, and Zitz]]), punch and kick oncoming enemies through six [[Level (video gaming)|levels]]&lt;ref name=RG86/&gt; to save their alternate universe from the [[Dark Queen (Battletoads)|Dark Queen]].&lt;ref name=KLOV/&gt; ''Arcade'' was the first ''Battletoads'' game to feature three-player [[Cooperative gameplay|cooperative multiplayer]].&lt;ref name=RG86/&gt; Players control their characters with [[ordinal direction|eight-directional]] [[joystick]]s and two buttons (attack and jump).&lt;ref name=KLOV/&gt; Characters can run if the player pushes the joystick twice in the same direction.&lt;ref name="AllGame: controls"/&gt; The Toads vary in fighting style: Rash is nimble, Pimple is burly, and Zitz is a balance of the two.&lt;ref name=KLOV/&gt; As customary for the series, the Toads can knocked enemies offscreen such that they appear to fly towards the players, [[fourth wall|breaking the fourth wall]].&lt;ref name="AllGame: review"/&gt;&lt;ref name=RG86/&gt; The Toads can also eat flies to regenerate [[Health (gaming)|health]].&lt;ref name=KLOV/&gt; Each Toad has its own signature exaggerated power and attack,&lt;ref name=RG86/&gt; in which their limbs turn into objects such as axes and drills.&lt;ref name="AllGame: review"/&gt; Enemies include aliens, mutant rodents, and snowmen.&lt;ref name="AllGame: synopsis"/&gt;

Each level has a unique theme, such as a "Christmas grotto",&lt;ref name=RG86/&gt; and a [[Boss (video gaming)|boss fight]] finale.&lt;ref name="AllGame: synopsis"/&gt; Some bosses, such as General Slaughter, return from previous games.&lt;ref name=RG86/&gt; Some levels differ in presentation and gameplay. Some levels are ''[[Double Dragon]]''-style [[2.5D (visual perception)|2.5D]] brawlers, while others are strictly two-dimensional. In one level, the Toads wear jetpacks and descend a tunnel, and in the final level, the Toads shoot enemies from a vehicle.&lt;ref name=KLOV/&gt; Players can also destroy a spaceship in a ''[[Street Fighter II]]''-style [[bonus stage]].&lt;ref name=RG86/&gt; ''Battletoads Arcade'' is displayed in [[standard-definition television|standard definition]] [[raster graphics]] in horizontal orientation with either mono or stereo sound within an upright [[arcade cabinet]].&lt;ref name=KLOV/&gt;

== Development ==

The game was developed by [[Rare (company)|Rare]], published by [[Electronic Arts]], and released in 1994&lt;ref name="IGN: retrospective"/&gt; as the fifth game in the ''Battletoads'' series. Rare founders Tim and Chris Stamper created the series in response to interest in the ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles]]''. The ''Battletoads'' series—especially the 1991 original ''[[Battletoads (video game)|Battletoads]]'' for the [[Nintendo Entertainment System]] (NES)—became popular in its own right and led to a series of sequels.&lt;ref name=RG86/&gt;&lt;ref name="AllGame: synopsis"/&gt; Since this sequel was in development for arcades rather than consoles, Rare took greater liberties in its depiction of violence, unlike their obligations in the rest of the series. While the original NES ''Battletoads'' censored blood, ''Battletoads Arcade'' showed gore and decapitation. The Dark Queen was also depicted in a more lascivious style.&lt;ref name="IGN: retrospective"/&gt; Rare had begun to experiment with 3D graphics around this time, and went with [[PowerAnimator]] (later [[Autodesk Maya]]). ''Battletoads Arcade'' was the first Rare game to use PowerAnimator, well before it was implemented in ''[[Killer Instinct]]'' and ''[[Donkey Kong Country]]''.&lt;ref name=RG123/&gt; Rare's George Andreas had worked on the game and recalled it sitting around "for ages" despite being finished. Andreas could not discern why the game was unsuccessful, as it had [[playtest]]ed and sold well in their market tests.&lt;ref name=RG84/&gt; A [[Porting of video games|port]] for the [[Super Nintendo Entertainment System|Super NES]] was planned but canceled, likely due to the game's mediocre reception in arcades.&lt;ref name=RG86/&gt; Rare's Brendan Gunn had worked on the port and said that the team had nearly finished the first level before the project was scrapped. He figured that the decision may have been linked to mediocre sales but was not sure.&lt;ref name=RG84/&gt; ''Battletoads Arcade'' is also known as ''Super Battletoads''.&lt;ref name="IGN: Super B"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Polygon: Super B"/&gt;

''Battletoads Arcade'' received its first console release as ''Battletoads Arcade'' when it was emulated for the [[Xbox One]] as part of the 2015 ''[[Rare Replay]]'' compilation of 30 games from Rare's 30-year history.&lt;ref name="Destructoid: Rare Replay"/&gt; In the ''Rare Replay'' version, additional features include a setting for unlimited [[Glossary of video game terms#Continue|continues]], the ability to "rewind" time (and replay a section), and the opportunity to [[saved game|save game progress]] at any time.&lt;ref name="Engadget: Rare Replay"/&gt;

}}
In a 2013 interview, Rare's Chris Tilson said that the company had low expectations for future arcade releases after ''Battletoads Arcade'' "bombed badly".&lt;ref name=RG123/&gt; Sales were mediocre.&lt;ref name=RG86/&gt; Christopher Michael Baker (''[[AllGame]]'') wrote that the arcade release rode the success of its console game predecessor when the order is usually reversed. He found the two games similar in brawling style with simple controls, but felt that the arcade game had better graphics. He noted how both included the effect of knocking enemies towards the players off-screen. Baker felt that the signature attacks were interesting and added [[replay value]]. Overall, he was somewhat let down by the arcade game, having expected something more, but rated ''Battletoads Arcade'' four of five stars.&lt;ref name="AllGame: review"/&gt; ''AllGame'' compared ''Battletoads Arcade'' to ''[[Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles: Turtles in Time|Turtles in Time]]'' and ''[[The Simpsons Arcade Game]]''.&lt;ref name="AllGame: synopsis"/&gt;

''[[Retro Gamer]]'' retrospectively wrote that ''Battletoads Arcade'' was a "relatively obscure" game, but the best in the series. They described it as "unmistakeable" Rare: "bombastic, colorful, and well-designed". ''Retro Gamer'' put it on par with the arcade games of [[Konami]] and [[Sega]] and praised its humor, combat, and character. They added that ''Arcade'' was a [[swan song]] for the series, with numerous references to moments and levels from previous games. For example, the first stage atop the Dark Queen's ship was similar to the opening of ''[[Battletoads &amp; Double Dragon]]'' and the jetpack level was reminiscent of the "Wookie Hole" level in the original ''Battletoads''. The magazine added that the level of gore set it apart from previous series entries and that the game had a mediocre reception in arcades. They called its console cancellation "a tragedy".&lt;ref name=RG86/&gt;

Chris Carter (''[[Destructoid]]'') wrote that the game was an unexpected favorite in his ''Rare Replay'' review.&lt;ref name="Destructoid: Rare Replay"/&gt; Philip Kollar (''[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'') was also "surprised" by the game, which he found incredibly fun. Kollar ranked the game near the middle of the ''Rare Replay'' collection.&lt;ref name="Polygon: ranked"/&gt; Timothy Seppala (''[[Engadget]]'') was grateful to be introduced to ''Battletoads Arcade'' on ''Rare Replay''. He considered the game among Rare's "finest moments" and one of two retro titles worth playing.&lt;ref name="Engadget: Rare Replay"/&gt; Sam Machkovech (''[[Ars Technica]]'') described the game as one of the rarest in the compilation.&lt;ref name="Ars Technica: review"/&gt;

== Legacy ==

As of 2017, ''Battletoads Arcade'' remains the last ''Battletoads'' game released.&lt;ref name="IGN: retrospective"/&gt;&lt;ref name=RG86/&gt; Rare had begun planning on a possible sequel in the mid-2000s but ultimately decided that there was no original direction for the game apart from its past. They did not want to repeat the failed [[TMNT (video game)|''Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles'' reboot]].&lt;ref name=RG84/&gt; ''Battletoads Arcade'' served as an inspiration for the cooperative play mode in the 2011 ''[[Ratchet &amp; Clank: All 4 One]]''.&lt;ref name="Gamasutra: Ratchet"/&gt; ''Kotaku'' included ''Battletoads Arcade'' in its list of [[16-bit era]] beat 'em ups with the best graphics.&lt;ref name="Kotaku: best looking"/&gt;

'''Bauerntarock''' (farmers' [[tarot]]) also called '''Brixentaler Bauerntarock''', is a [[Trick-taking game|point-trick card game]] played in the [[Brixental]], Austria.&lt;ref name="GoT"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|title=The Game of Tarot|date=1980|publisher=Duckworth|location=London|pages=556-561|ref=GoT}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may have originated in the 19th century as an adaptation of the 54-card [[Tapp Tarock]] game onto the cheaper and smaller 36-card [[German playing cards|German deck]].&lt;ref name="Parlett"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Parlett|first1=David|title=The Oxford Guide to Card Games|date=1990|publisher=Oxford University Press|location=Oxford|pages=266-268|ref=Parlett}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possibility is that it was adapted from the 78-card Tarok-Ombre game as the ratio of trumps to non-trumps is almost the same.&lt;ref name="History"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Dummett|first1=Michael|last2=McLeod|first2=John|title=A History of Games Played with the Tarot Pack|date=2004|publisher=The Edwin Mellen Press|location=Lewiston|pages=125-148|ref=History}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ulf"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Ulf|first1=Martin|title=The Tarock of the Skat Inventors part II|journal=[[The Playing-Card]]|date=2016|volume=44|issue=3|pages=164-178}}&lt;/ref&gt; It uses the [[Skat Schedule]] found in popular regional games such as [[Jass]] and [[Schafkopf]]. It is closely related to [[Bavarian Tarock]], [[Württemberg Tarock]], and especially [[Dobbm]].&lt;ref&gt;McLeod, John. [https://www.pagat.com/aceten/toppm.html Dobbm] at [[pagat.com]]. Retrieved 17 November 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; Like Bavarian Tarock and [[Tapp (card game)|Tapp]], Brixental Bauerntarock and Dobbm do not belong to the true [[tarot]] games, but have adopted rules from [[Tapp Tarock]]. The most fundamental difference between these games and true tarot games is in the use of German or French decks instead of true [[Tarot playing cards]].


== Cards ==
=== Trick-taking strength ===
The cards’ trick-taking power broadly corresponds to their card point value. Thus the [[Deuce (playing card)|Deuce or ''Daus'']] (''Sau, Ass'') is the highest-ranking card. Then follow the: Ten &gt; [[King (playing card)|King]] &gt; [[Ober (playing card)|Ober]] &gt; [[Unter (playing card)|Unter]] &gt; Nine &gt; Eight &gt; Seven &gt; Six. This ranking is also valid within the trump suit as well as the plain suits. Hearts are permanent trumps.

=== Card value ===
The card values are exactly the same as in [[Schafkopf]] or the related game of [[Bavarian Tarock]]. The ten, with 10 points, is just below the ''Daus'' (11 points) in value, but well above the King (4), Ober (3) and Unter (2). The so-called ''Spatzen'' ("sparrows" i.e. the Nines, Eights, Sevens and Sixes) only play a role during the game based on their trick-taking ability, but do not score points at the end of the hand.

There are 120 card points in the deck. The 6 of bells is marked as "[[Weli|WELI]]" but has no significance in this game. The lowest trump, the 6 of hearts, however, is called the ''Spatz'' (sparrow) and plays a special role in bonuses and penalties mirroring the role of the ''[[The Magician (Tarot card)|pagat]]''.

== Rules ==
=== Dealing ===
Like most [[Ace-Ten games]] but unlike other [[tarot card games]], rotation is clockwise. In a three-player game, the dealer passes out eleven cards to each player with three cards going to the ''[[talon (cards)|talon]]'' (stock). With four players, everyone gets eight cards with four going to the ''talon''.

=== Bidding ===
Players bid to become the declarer and play against the others (the defenders). Bidding starts with the player to the dealer's left. Tarock players have the following options:
*'''Pass''' (''Weiter''): if all players pass, then the dealer redeals.
*'''Play''' (''Ich spiele!''): the player is bidding for one of two contracts:
**'''Hineinschauen''': The lower bid. The declarer can exchange cards with ''talon''.
**'''Sumpern''': The higher bid. The declarer does not use the ''talon'' (i.e. it is a 'hand game') and the score is doubled (240 points). Other players may raise this by declaring "five points more" (''fünf Augen mehr''); in turn this may be raised with "ten points more" (''zehn Augen mehr'') i.e. bidding to score 71 card points. This may continue in steps of five points to the maximum which is "all tricks" (''alle Stiche'').

The discarded cards or the unused ''talon'' will count towards the declarer's score at the end of the hand unless he failed to win any tricks. In this case, he is ''matsch'' and the talon is forfeited to the defenders. After bidding, any defender who passed has the right to double the score for the hand (240 or 480 points). The declarer then has the right to redouble (480 or 960 points).

=== Playing ===

The declarer's goal is to win a majority of card points. The declarer leads to the first trick. Players must follow suit (''[[Farbzwang]]''). If void, they must play a trump (''[[Trumpfzwang]]''). Only when void of the suit led and trumps can any card be sloughed. There is no compulsion to win the trick (no ''[[Stichzwang]]''). The winner of each trick leads to the next one.

There is a penalty of 5 points for losing the ''Spatz'' to the opposite side; 10 points if it was on the last trick. There is a bonus of 10 points for winning the last trick with the ''Spatz''. These points are also subject to doubling.

== Scoring ==
The declarer's game score is calculated by subtracting half the points of the hand (60 points for no doubling, 120 for once, 240 for twice, or 480 for thrice) from the hand score (points from captured cards, ''Spatz'' penalties or bonuses, and the ''talon'' which may have been doubled, redoubled, etc.) After one player accumulates a game score of 100 or more, the number of new hands to play is limited to the current round (everyone should have had an equal chance as dealer). The winner is the player with the highest cumulative game score and the others have to pay the difference. The player with the lowest game score has to pay an extra 20 points to the winner.&lt;ref name="GoT" /&gt;

'''''BioShock Infinite''''' is a [[first-person shooter]] [[video game]] developed by [[Irrational Games]] and published by [[2K Games]]. It was released worldwide for the [[Microsoft Windows]], [[PlayStation 3]], and [[Xbox 360]] platforms on March 26, 2013; an [[OS X]] port by [[Aspyr]] was later released on August 29, 2013 and a [[Linux]] port was released on March 17, 2015. ''Infinite'' is the third installment in the [[BioShock (series)|''BioShock'' series]], and though it is not immediately part of the storyline of previous ''BioShock'' games, it features similar gameplay concepts and themes. Irrational Games and creative director [[Ken Levine (game developer)|Ken Levine]] based the game's setting on historical events at the turn of the 20th century, such as the 1893 [[World's Columbian Exposition]], and based the story on the concept of [[American exceptionalism]], while also incorporating influences from more recent events at the time such as the 2011 [[Occupy movement]].

The game is set in the year 1912 and follows its protagonist, former [[Pinkerton (detective agency)|Pinkerton]] agent [[List of characters in the BioShock series#Booker DeWitt|Booker DeWitt]], who is sent to the airborne city of [[Columbia (BioShock)|Columbia]] to find a young woman, [[Elizabeth (BioShock)|Elizabeth]], who has been held captive there for most of her life. Though Booker rescues Elizabeth, the two become involved with the city's warring factions: the [[Nativism (politics)|nativist]] and [[Elitism|elite]] Founders that rule Columbia and strive to keep its privileges for [[White Americans]], and the Vox Populi, underground [[Rebellion|rebels]] representing the [[underclass]] of the city. During this conflict, Booker learns that Elizabeth possesses strange powers to manipulate "Tears" in the [[space-time continuum]] that ravage Columbia, and soon discovers her to be central to the city's dark secrets.

The player controls Booker Dewitt throughout the game, eventually working with the [[artificial intelligence (video games)|AI]]-controlled Elizabeth. Like previous ''BioShock'' games, the player uses a combination of weapons, clothing called Gear that offer unique attributes, and psychokinetic powers granted through Vigors. Elizabeth's powers can also be used to help fight hostile forces. In contrast to the limited spaces of the underwater city of [[Rapture (BioShock)|Rapture]], the openness of Columbia provides for more dynamic combat, including combat that takes place aboard the city's Sky-Line [[rollercoaster]]-like rail system. [[Downloadable content]] for the game includes a story-based mission, ''[[BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea|Burial at Sea]]'', that links ''Infinite''{{'}}s story to that of the original ''[[BioShock]]'' game.

The game won over 85 pre-release awards for its display at [[Electronic Entertainment Expo 2011|E3 2011]], including [[Game Critics Awards#Best of Show|Best of Show]] from the [[Game Critics Awards]]. At release, ''BioShock Infinite'' received critical acclaim, with praise particularly directed at its story, setting, and visual art design, and is often regarded as one of the best video games of the [[Seventh generation of video game consoles|seventh generation of consoles]]. According to review aggregator [[Metacritic]], it was the third-highest rated video game of 2013. Within two months of release, it sold over 3.7 million retail copies, and has since sold more than 11 million copies overall. [[List of accolades received by BioShock Infinite|It won year-end accolades]], including [[Game of the Year]] from several [[Video game journalism|gaming publications]]. A remastered version of the game was released on [[PlayStation 4]] and [[Xbox One]] on September 13, 2016, as part of ''[[BioShock: The Collection]]'', alongside its predecessors. 

An April 2018 article by [[Kotaku]] stated that a sequel to ''BioShock Infinite'' is in development, under the [[Working title|working name]] ''Parkside''.

Reaching an [[airship]], Booker promises to take Elizabeth to [[Paris]]; when she realizes they are going to [[New York City]] to wipe away Booker's debt, a tearful Elizabeth knocks him out. Booker awakens to find the airship under the control of Daisy Fitzroy, who offers to return the ship if Booker helps her arm the Vox Populi.

Booker and Elizabeth join forces to secure weapons from a local gunsmith.  However, several twists of fate result in Elizabeth having to overlay the contents of various Tears onto the present reality.  Ultimately, they land in a world where Booker is a [[martyr]] of the Vox Populi whose "sacrifice" sparked open warfare between the two factions. Fitzroy, convinced that the non-dead Booker is "either an impostor, or a ghost," turns her forces against him. With Booker's help, Elizabeth kills Fitzroy to prevent her from executing a Founder boy. As they attempt to leave by airship, Songbird attacks the duo and they crash back to Columbia. Continuing onwards, they unravel a conspiracy behind the city's founding: Zachary Hale Comstock had the Lutece twins construct a "Siphon" device to inhibit Elizabeth's powers; Elizabeth is Comstock's adopted daughter, whom he plans to groom into taking over after his death; and Comstock plotted to kill his wife and the Luteces to hide the truth. 

Elizabeth is again captured by Songbird, and as Booker pursues, he ends up brought forward in time to 1984 by an elderly Elizabeth, showing him the devastation that Columbia is causing while attacking New York City. The older Elizabeth prepares to return Booker to 1912 and gives him information on controlling Songbird, in hopes he can recover her younger self and erase the years of torture and brainwashing she had suffered in becoming Comstock's tool.&lt;ref name="eurogamer ending"/&gt; Once returned, Booker rescues Elizabeth, and the pair pursue Comstock to his airship. Comstock demands that Booker explain Elizabeth's past to her and the two begin to argue; an enraged Booker smashes the back of Comstock's skull on a [[baptismal font]] before drowning him. Booker denies knowledge about Elizabeth's missing little finger, but she asserts that he has simply forgotten. Controlling Songbird, the pair fend off a massive Vox Populi attack, before ordering Songbird to destroy the Siphon. 

As Songbird turns on Booker again, Elizabeth's powers fully awaken, allowing her to open a Tear and transport them to the underwater city of [[Rapture (BioShock)|Rapture]].{{efn|It is not clear if this is the same Rapture from either of the previous two ''BioShock'' games.

Elizabeth explains that Comstock will always remain alive in alternate universes, as the Luteces have enlisted the Bookers of numerous different universes to try to end the cycle.&lt;ref name="eurogamer ending"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-04-bioshock-infinite-ending-explained |title=BioShock Infinite ending explained |first=Tom |last=Phillips |date=April 4, 2013 |accessdate=April 4, 2013 |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130407094002/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-04-bioshock-infinite-ending-explained |archivedate=April 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As stopping Comstock requires intervening in his birth, Elizabeth takes Booker back in time to a baptism he attended, in the hope of atoning for the sins he committed at Wounded Knee; she explains that, while Booker changed his mind, some Bookers in alternate universes accepted the baptism and were reborn as "Zachary Comstock."&lt;ref name="eurogamer ending"/&gt; Comstock, later aware of his connection to Booker and sterility from overusing the Lutece Tear machine, abducted Anna to provide a biological heir for Columbia. Booker, by now joined by other universe Elizabeths at the baptism, allows them to drown him at the moment of his baptismal choice, thus preventing Comstock's existence. One by one, the Elizabeths begin to disappear, the screen cutting to black on the last.&lt;ref name="cvg ending"/&gt;

In a [[post-credits scene]], a&lt;!--there is no confirmation that this Booker is the one we have been playing throughout the game--&gt; Booker{{efn|The game does not clarify if this is the same version of Booker that the player has played as, or a Booker from a different alternate reality.}} awakens in his apartment on October 8, 1893.

==Gameplay==
Like ''BioShock'' and ''BioShock 2'', ''BioShock Infinite'' is a [[first-person shooter]] with [[role-playing video game|role-playing]] elements. In contrast to the limited spaces of Rapture in previous ''BioShock'' games, the expanded environment of Columbia provides for more dynamic combat challenges in ''Infinite''.&lt;ref name="cvg combat"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/347753/interviews/bioshock-infinite-combat-has-evolved-in-a-very-substantial-way/ |title=BioShock Infinite: 'Combat has evolved in a very substantial way' |first=Tom |last=Ivan |date=May 25, 2012 |accessdate=May 27, 2012 |work=[[Computer and Video Games]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120527073533/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/347753/interviews/bioshock-infinite-combat-has-evolved-in-a-very-substantial-way/ |archivedate=May 27, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; As Booker, the player must fight their way through Columbia using weapons and a variety of tools in order to complete objectives. The player may carry only two weapons at a time,&lt;ref name="manual7"&gt;{{Harvnb|Irrational Games, ed.|(2013)|page=7|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt; and can collect other weapons and ammunition either from defeated enemies or from random locations around the city.&lt;ref name="guide17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Walsh; Sharp|(2013)|page=17|ref=guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to his health, Booker is also equipped with a shield. When damaged, the shield regenerates after a few seconds, while health can be replenished with medical kits or food.&lt;ref name="manual2"&gt;{{Harvnb|Irrational Games, ed.|(2013)|page=2|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt; Should Booker die, the player revives in a safe area but loses a slight amount of money; Booker regains partial health and is granted additional ammunition, while local enemies are also partially healed. Players can still recover from death should they lose all their money.&lt;ref name="guide13"&gt;{{Harvnb|Walsh; Sharp|(2013)|page=13|ref=guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Booker gains powers and abilities through Vigors, Gears, and Infusions, all scattered around Columbia. Vigors, the equivalent of ''BioShock''{{'}}s Plasmids,&lt;ref name="polygon dec2012 preview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2012/12/7/3739008/bioshock-infinite-hands-on-preview |title=BioShock Infinite hands-on: Mysteries in the clouds |first=Michael |last=McWheartor |date=December 7, 2012 |accessdate=December 7, 2012 |publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121210230504/http://www.polygon.com/2012/12/7/3739008/bioshock-infinite-hands-on-preview |archivedate=December 10, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; grant activated powers such as creating shockwaves, releasing bolts of electricity, and machine/human possession.&lt;ref name="manual10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Irrational Games, ed.|(2013)|page=10|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vigors require Salt, the equivalent of [[magic points]] or ''BioShock''{{'}}s EVE, for powering their abilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/08/what-i-didnt-love-about-bioshock-infinite/ |title=What I didn’t love about BioShock Infinite |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=December 8, 2012 |accessdate=December 12, 2012 |first=Evan |last=Lahti |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121212175317/http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/08/what-i-didnt-love-about-bioshock-infinite/ |archivedate=December 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Salts can be found throughout Columbia,&lt;ref name="guide17"/&gt; and are also granted upon death.&lt;ref name="guide13"/&gt; Wearing Gears grant passive abilities that can improve the player's strength or damage resistance, similar in function to ''BioShock''{{'}}s Tonics.&lt;ref name="polygon dec2012 preview"/&gt; Each piece of Gear attaches to one of four specific slots: Hats, Shirts, Boots, and Pants. Only one piece of Gear can be affixed to a slot at a time; any extra Gear is stored in the player's inventory.&lt;ref name="guide17"/&gt; Infusions grant the ability to permanently boost the player's health, Salts or shield meter by one stat; they also fully restore whatever is being boosted.&lt;ref name="guide17"/&gt;

At certain points throughout the story, the player will be forced to make a choice in order to continue, each choice making minor changes on the story. For example, at a raffle at the start of the game, Booker wins and the raffle is revealed to be a front for a public stoning of an interracial couple. As a reward for winning the raffle, Booker is given the very first throw, and the player is given a choice to throw at the couple or at the announcer. If the player chooses the latter option, the couple appears later to thank him for sparing them, but if the player chooses the former option, the announcer congratulates him later in the game.&lt;ref name="guide34"&gt;{{Harvnb|Walsh; Sharp|(2013)|page=34|ref=guide}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Syline Combat.jpg|thumb|upright=1.2|[[List of characters in the BioShock series#Booker DeWitt|Booker]] wielding a gun as he rides the Sky-Line in combat]]
Booker can traverse Columbia both on foot and by riding the "Sky-Line." The Sky-Line is a [[roller coaster]]-like rail-based system — originally designed for moving cargo around Columbia but later used for personal transport — whereupon the player activates a wrist-mounted tool — called the Sky-Hook — that Booker and enemies wear to jump and hang onto the self-powered tracks. The player can jump onto, off of, and between Sky-Line tracks at any time, and may face enemies that use the system to attack; the player can use one-handed weapons in Booker's free hand while using the Sky-Line. Freedom of movement along the Sky-Line allows for several varieties of combat, including flanking, cover, and area-of-effect attacks through creative uses of the system.&lt;ref name="kotaku interview"/&gt;&lt;ref name="psblog levine"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/09/22/bioshock-infinite-10-minute-gameplay-video-ken-levine-talks-combat/ |title=BioShock Infinite: 10-minute Gameplay Video, Ken Levine Talks Combat |first=Sid |last=Shuman |date=September 22, 2010 |accessdate=September 24, 2010 |publisher=[[Sony Computer Entertainment]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100926214727/http://blog.eu.playstation.com/2010/09/22/bioshock-infinite-10-minute-gameplay-video-ken-levine-talks-combat/ |archivedate=September 26, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ign levine interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/111/1112232p2.html |title=Building the World of BioShock Infinite |first=David |last=Clayman |date=August 19, 2010 |accessdate=August 23, 2010 |work=[[IGN]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100823085455/http://xbox360.ign.com/articles/111/1112232p2.html |archivedate=August 23, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Booker can also dive off from the Sky-Line to strike enemies with his Sky-Hook; while on the ground, he can melee and execute enemies with it.&lt;ref name="manual4"&gt;{{Harvnb|Irrational Games, ed.|(2013)|page=4|ref=manual}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Once reunited with Elizabeth, the player must work with her to escape Columbia. The player does not directly control Elizabeth, but instead she reacts to the player and the current situation in a manner similar to the [[AI]] Director in ''[[Left 4 Dead]]''.&lt;ref name="kotaku interview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5614097/it-would-be-dishonest-to-say-this-is-not-bioshock |title=It Would Be Dishonest To Say This Is Not BioShock |first=Stephan |last=Tolito |date=August 16, 2010 |accessdate=August 16, 2010 |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100818090150/http://kotaku.com/5614097/it-would-be-dishonest-to-say-this-is-not-bioshock |archivedate=August 18, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike ''BioShock'', where the player is tasked with protecting a Little Sister while [[Quest (video gaming)#Escort quests|escorting]] her,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/07/ask-ars-is-bioshock-infinite-going-to-be-one-long-escort-mission.ars |title=Ask Ars: will Bioshock Infinite be one long escort mission? |first=Ben |last=Kuchera |date=July 17, 2011 |accessdate=July 18, 2011 |publisher=[[Ars Technica]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722095855/http://arstechnica.com/gaming/news/2011/07/ask-ars-is-bioshock-infinite-going-to-be-one-long-escort-mission.ars |archivedate=July 22, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elizabeth requires no protection and can take care of herself in combat.&lt;ref name="psblog levine"/&gt; While the player is in battle, Elizabeth scavenges the area for supplies such as ammunition, medical kits, Salts, and other items, and tosses them to Booker as needed. She can also use her Tear-opening powers to aid the player, bringing in weapons, health, Salts, environmental features such as cover or a ledge for higher ground, and automated defense units.

As the player progresses through the city, he is opposed by various enemies, classified into three types: Standard Enemies, Heavy Hitters and Basic Security Automata.

The Vox Populi also possess their own versions of the Fireman, Beast and Motorized Patriot. Basic Security Automata are armed machines scattered throughout Columbia that act as a security defense system for the city, consisting of the fixed Gun and Rocket Automatons, and the flying Mosquito.&lt;ref name="manual11-13"/&gt;

After completing the story mode on Easy, Normal, or Hard difficulties, a "1999 Mode" is unlocked, where the challenge of the game is significantly increased. Enemies are much tougher, the player's navigational aid and aim assist is removed, and resource management is much more crucial to survival; also, the difficulty of the game cannot be changed while playing. Additionally, in this mode, reviving after dying uses up more money; should Booker die with less than $100, the game ends, and the player is sent back to the main menu and has to resume from their last autosave prior to the section where they died.&lt;ref name="EuroG review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="guide11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Walsh; Sharp|(2013)|page=11|ref=guide}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alternatively, 1999 Mode can simply be unlocked by inputting a secret code — the [[Konami Code]] — in the main menu.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/03/25/bioshock-infinite-1999-mode-konami-code/ |title=Unlock BioShock Infinite's 1999 mode with the Konami code |first=Omri |last=Petitte |date=March 26, 2013 |accessdate=November 14, 2013 |work=[[PC Gamer]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131105193402/http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/03/25/bioshock-infinite-1999-mode-konami-code/ |archivedate=November 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The mode is a callback to ''[[System Shock 2]]'', a video game developed by Irrational Games, released in 1999.&lt;ref name="kotaku 1999"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5878338/average-gamers-are-going-to-hate-bioshock-infinites-1999-mode |title=Average Gamers are Going To Hate BioShock Infinite's 1999 Mode |first=Mike |last=Fahey |date=January 23, 2012 |accessdate=March 10, 2014 |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140328142321/http://kotaku.com/5878338/average-gamers-are-going-to-hate-bioshock-infinites-1999-mode |archivedate=March 28, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The original score for ''BioShock Infinite'' was composed by [[Garry Schyman]], who had previously composed both the scores for ''BioShock'' and ''BioShock 2''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2012/12/20/bioshock-infinite-scored-by-series-composer-garry-schyman/ |title=BioShock: Infinite scored by series composer Garry Schyman |first=Brenna |last=Hillier |date=December 20, 2012 |accessdate=December 20, 2012 |publisher=[[VG247]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121224012605/http://www.vg247.com/2012/12/20/bioshock-infinite-scored-by-series-composer-garry-schyman/ |archivedate=December 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Ken Levine stated that ''Infinite''{{'}}s score was different compared to that of the previous games in the series, in that it was "sparer" in "instrumentation and the style." He felt that the game had a "much more of an American feel to it," and added that team wanted "a bit more of a [[American frontier|frontier]] feel to it, slightly." Levine went on to comment that the score was partly inspired by [[Jonny Greenwood]]'s score for ''[[There Will Be Blood]]'', which served as a "good" starting point, and [[Paul Buckmaster]]'s score for ''[[12 Monkeys (film)|12 Monkeys]]''.&lt;ref name="IGN music"/&gt;

From the very beginning during development, Schyman opted for a completely fresh approach to the score for ''Infinite'' due to its differences with previous ''BioShock'' games.&lt;ref name="gameinformer music"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2013/03/19/game-music-spotlight-bioshock-infinite-composer-gary-schyman.aspx |title=Game Music Spotlight: BioShock Infinite Composer Gary Schyman |first=Matt |last=Helgeson |date=March 19, 2013 |accessdate=January 7, 2014 |work=[[Game Informer]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140110174754/http://www.gameinformer.com/b/features/archive/2013/03/19/game-music-spotlight-bioshock-infinite-composer-gary-schyman.aspx |archivedate=January 10, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He said that compared to the previous games, ''Infinite''{{'}}s world and time period were "completely different and unique in nearly every respect," and that it was "much more fleshed out in terms of the characters" with story being driven by the two main protagonists.&lt;ref name="IGN music"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/2013/03/12/the-music-of-bioshock-infinite |title=The Music of BioShock Infinite |work=[[IGN]] |date=March 12, 2013 |accessdate=January 7, 2014 |first=Andrew |last=Goldfarb |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140219172526/http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/03/12/the-music-of-bioshock-infinite |archivedate=February 19, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Schyman noted that he worked on the score over an extended period of time, and due to the game's long and evolving development cycle, it took longer to find the right approach to the score.&lt;ref name="PCGamer music"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/03/14/bioshock-infinites-composer-garry-schyman-on-making-music-for-the-songbird/ |title=BioShock Infinite's composer Garry Schyman on making music for the Songbird |work=[[PC Gamer]] |date=March 15, 2013 |accessdate=January 7, 2014 |first= |last=PC Gamer |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107071740/http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/03/14/bioshock-infinites-composer-garry-schyman-on-making-music-for-the-songbird/ |archivedate=January 7, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; After much experimentation, Schyman found that using a simpler musical score was best for the game as he felt that it was consistent with the simpler time of 1912.&lt;ref name="IGN music"/&gt; However, Schyman stated that he did not limit himself to the [[1912 in music|music of the period]],&lt;ref name="IGN music"/&gt; and added that while the game's setting of 1912 was very influential, it was not determinative. He said, "I did not wish to imitate the popular music of 1912 which is not particularly emotional to our ears in 2013."&lt;ref name="PCGamer music"/&gt; Originally working with a more [[orchestra]]l approach, Schyman later used very intimate small [[String orchestra|string ensembles]] with anywhere from three to ten players to compose the game's relatively simpler score.&lt;ref name="IGN music"/&gt; Schyman also called Elizabeth a critical element to the music, explaining that "a lot of the music relates to her and some of the emotional things that she's going through." He went on to describe ''Infinite''{{'}}s music as "more of an emotional score" as it was about the relationship between the two key characters in the game, Booker and Elizabeth.&lt;ref name="gameinformer music"/&gt;

Levine stated that choosing the [[Music licensing|licensed music]] for ''Infinite'' was much more challenging compared to the original ''BioShock''.&lt;ref name="wired Q&amp;A"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/04/ken-levine-interview/all/ |title=Q&amp;A: Ken Levine’s Brave New World of BioShock Infinite |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=April 26, 2012 |accessdate=January 7, 2013 |first=John |last=Mix Meyer |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130602054559/http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2012/04/ken-levine-interview/all/ |archivedate=June 2, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="kotaku jazz"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/5896452/jazz-teddy-roosevelt-and-jumping-off-the-edge-what-makes-bioshock-infinite-tick |title=Jazz, Teddy Roosevelt, and Jumping Off the Edge: What Makes BioShock Infinite Tick |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |date=March 26, 2012 |accessdate=March 26, 2012 |first=Kate |last=Cox |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120329005013/http://kotaku.com/5896452/jazz-teddy-roosevelt-and-jumping-off-the-edge-what-makes-bioshock-infinite-tick |archivedate=March 29, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He commented that with the original ''BioShock'', set in 1960 in the mid 20th century, it was easy to acquire musical pieces representative of the era, with him saying that the team "had this huge slate of great music to choose from."&lt;ref name="wired Q&amp;A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kotaku jazz"/&gt; Levine stated that with ''Infinite'', however, it was set in 1912 in the early 20th century, which had music he described to be "awful" and "not very listenable" to the "modern ear." Consequently, the development team had to "dig really deep" and research extensively for more satisfactory music in ''Infinite''{{'}}s time period.&lt;ref name="wired Q&amp;A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kotaku jazz"/&gt; Levine noted that he was not strict with selecting the music and songs that was accurate to the game's time period, as he felt that the most important thing with regards to the music was "that you get people to feel things." He added that the game's fictional nature justified him and the team "play[ing] a little fast and loose" and "[doing] things a little differently" with the music.&lt;ref name="wired Q&amp;A"/&gt; Levine also stated that ''Infinite''{{'}}s music would play a "strange role" in the game; he explained that the music would "tie into the macro story, to some degree," and that the team had "a lot of little stories" to tell about it.&lt;ref name="wired Q&amp;A"/&gt;&lt;ref name="kotaku jazz"/&gt;

''BioShock Infinite''{{'}}s soundtrack, original music, and songs received numerous accolades. The game won for Best Song in a Game ("[[Will the Circle Be Unbroken?]]" performed by Courtnee Draper &amp; Troy Baker) and was nominated for Best Soundtrack at the VGX 2013.&lt;ref name="VGX_2013"/&gt; It later won for Outstanding Achievement in Original Music Composition at the 17th Annual D.I.C.E.

Although the gameplay's combat was mostly well received and praised,&lt;ref name="GI review PC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSpot review X360/PC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rev3 Review"/&gt; it was the most polarizing aspect of the game, with ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''{{'}}s Tom Hoggins noting "the gunplay is far from ''Infinite''{{'}}s most satisfying component."&lt;ref name="Telegraph Review"/&gt; Nevertheless, critics opined that the game's gunplay and shooting was an improvement over its predecessors.&lt;ref name="CVG review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="CCC review"/&gt; The game's expanded environments were well received,&lt;ref name="OPMUK review"/&gt; with ''Edge'' noting they encouraged the player to think more tactically and improvise.&lt;ref name="Edge review"/&gt; Tom Francis of ''[[PC Gamer]]'' and Hoggins felt that ''Infinite''{{'}}s overall combat was an improvement over the previous ''BioShock'' games largely due to the dynamism of the expanded environments.&lt;ref name="PCGUK review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph Review"/&gt; The addition of the Sky-Line received special praise from critics.&lt;ref name="IGN PC review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rev3 Review"/&gt; Sullivan felt that the Sky-Line "delivers a new FPS experience entirely,"&lt;ref name="GRadar review"/&gt; while Gregory hailed it as a "real game-changer."&lt;ref name="OPMUK review"/&gt; Critics also enjoyed the Vigors, weapons, and upgrades,&lt;ref name="GI review PC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSpot review X360/PC"/&gt; with McCaffrey praising the game's "myriad combat options."&lt;ref name="IGN PC review"/&gt;

In contrast, the gameplay was criticized by some as monotonous and repetitive,&lt;ref name="GameFront review"/&gt; with ''VideoGamer.com''{{'s}} Steven Burns explaining the game's lack of real sense of escalation in either abilities or enemies made combat very tiresome and grating.&lt;ref name="VG review"/&gt; Some also noted that ''Infinite'' had regressed into a simple shooter compared to the role-playing ''[[System Shock]]'' games,&lt;ref name="CVG review"/&gt; with Newman stating that "combat feels too constrained as a result."&lt;ref name="Time Review"/&gt; There were also complaints that middle portion of the game was padded by gameplay flaws.&lt;ref name="IGN PC review"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Telegraph Review"/&gt; Critics expressed disappointment that the game limited the player to only two weapons,&lt;ref name="VG review"/&gt; with Reparaz feeling that this, along with the lack of outlandish upgrades, made ''Infinite''{{'}}s "less inventive" combat "not quite up to ''BioShock''{{'}}s high standards."&lt;ref name="OXM review"/&gt; Criticism was also directed at the combat's "meager" death penalty,&lt;ref name="GI review PC"/&gt;&lt;ref name="OXM review"/&gt; with complaints that this resulted in a less challenging game.&lt;ref name="CVG review"/&gt;

==Themes==
Shawn Robertson, the game's lead artist, stated that, despite the several [[Theme (narrative)|themes]] the game would explore, the story in the end was not about them. Robertson explained that the themes were there to serve as a backdrop and to frame a "more human-sized" and emotionally resonant story about individuals. He went on to say that, while the "opera-sized story" and "the political turmoil" would serve as the background, the story was ultimately about Booker and Elizabeth.&lt;ref name="gamasutra reveal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/29872/Interview_Irrational_Games_Leaves_The_Sea_For_The_Sky_With_BioShock_Infinite.php |title=Interview: Irrational Games Leaves The Sea For The Sky With BioShock Infinite |first=Leigh |last=Alexander |date=August 12, 2010 |accessdate=August 12, 2010 |publisher=[[Gamasutra]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100815071828/http://www.gamasutra.com/view/news/29872/Interview_Irrational_Games_Leaves_The_Sea_For_The_Sky_With_BioShock_Infinite.php |archivedate=August 15, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ken Levine (game developer)|Ken Levine]], the creative lead of the game, stated that players are supposed to draw their own conclusions from the game, and ultimately decide "what is good and bad." He explained that "there are many parts of ''Infinite'' that are open to interpretation, and the purpose is that you draw your own theories from them." To this end, Levine avoided providing an authoritative final answer regarding the game's ending, replying "What actually matters is what people think. Why does my interpretation matter more than yours?"&lt;ref name="Levine meaning"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.computerandvideogames.com/416306/interviews/ken-levine-and-the-search-for-meaning-in-bioshock-infinite/ |title=Interview: Ken Levine and the search for meaning in BioShock Infinite |first=Rob |last=Crossley |date=June 26, 2013 |accessdate=November 8, 2013 |publisher=[[ComputerAndVideoGames.com]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109200057/http://www.computerandvideogames.com/416306/interviews/ken-levine-and-the-search-for-meaning-in-bioshock-infinite/ |archivedate=November 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Acknowledging that ''Infinite''{{'}}s themes left fans debating and frustrated, Levine was nevertheless satisfied by the game's opacity, stating that it was his intent, and compared the game's [[interpretation of quantum mechanics]] to some of his favorite films; ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (film)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'', ''[[Fight Club]]'', ''[[The Master (2012 film)|The Master]]'', ''[[Miller's Crossing]]'', and ''[[There Will Be Blood]]''.&lt;ref name="Levine meaning"/&gt; Rob Crossley of [[ComputerAndVideoGames.com|CVG]] stated that "To [Levine], the [game's] [[Many-worlds interpretation|Many Worlds Theory]] is a [[Literary technique|storytelling device]]; one that gives his narrative something unique in games yet celebrated in film: [[interpretability]].&lt;ref name="Levine meaning"/&gt;

Levine claimed that the core messages in ''Infinite'' were neither personal nor political, insisting instead that they were historical.

The game's theme of "constants and variables" received attention, primarily drawn towards the characters of Robert and Rosalind Lutece, who are shown to be key figures behind Columbia and the drivers for the game's events. In an early scene, they ask Booker to flip a coin, which has come up heads 122 times out of 122 flips evidenced by tally marks on both sides of the sandwich board worn by Robert) indicating that the Luteces have recruited a different Booker from a similar number of alternate realities, in order to accomplish their aims. The coin-flip is a "constant" present in every universe and is thus destined to always have the same result.&lt;ref name="eurogamer ending"/&gt; This scene has been compared to works like ''[[The Garden of Forking Paths]]'' and ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead]]'', which have similar themes about the subject of choice versus fate.&lt;ref name="Inc Fate"/&gt;&lt;ref name="eurogamer american fairground"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-05-bioshock-infinite-americas-fairground |title=BioShock Infinite: America's Fairground |publisher=[[Eurogamer]] |date=April 5, 2013 |accessdate=April 8, 2013 |first=Christian |last=Donlan |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408011352/http://www.eurogamer.net/articles/2013-04-05-bioshock-infinite-americas-fairground |archivedate=April 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The story's theme of multiple realities in particular was also commented as drawing parallels with the fact that, in contrast to previous ''BioShock'' games, ''Infinite'' only had a single ending despite the in-game morality decisions it offered. ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''{{'}}s Chris Kohler explained that, similar to how the alternate universes within the story all had their similar "constants" and different "variables", the game could be played through in an infinite number of ways, but that certain things would always be the same.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.wired.com/gamelife/2013/04/bioshock-infinite-spoilers/ |title=Letters From Columbia: Breaking Down BioShock Infinite |work=[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]] |date=April 3, 2013 |accessdate=December 28, 2013 |first=Chris |last=Kohler |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227220422/http://www.wired.com/gamelife/2013/04/bioshock-infinite-spoilers |archivedate=December 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Tom Phillips of [[Eurogamer]] agreed, interpreting Elizabeth's line ("We swim in different oceans, but land on the same shore") as meaning that, just like Booker's journey in different worlds, different players would have different experiences throughout the game but would nevertheless all reach the same ending.&lt;ref name="eurogamer ending"/&gt; This has led some to identify ''BioShock Infinite'' as a [[Metagaming|metagame]] and meta-commentary on the whole process of players making different choices in games.&lt;ref name="VentureTaka"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/04/12/the-deanbeat-bioshock-infinite-is-a-work-of-art-trapped-in-a-violent-video-game/ |title=The DeanBeat: BioShock Infinite is art trapped in a violent video game |publisher=[[VentureBeat]] |date=April 12, 2013 |accessdate=December 28, 2013 |first=Dean |last=Takahashi |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131228010807/http://venturebeat.com/2013/04/12/the-deanbeat-bioshock-infinite-is-a-work-of-art-trapped-in-a-violent-video-game/ |archivedate=December 28, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bioshock-infinite-review-irrational-ken-levine-booker-449979 |title=BioShock Infinite Review [Video] |first=Edward |last=Smith |date=March 25, 2013 |accessdate=December 29, 2013 |publisher=[[International Business Times UK]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235127/http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/bioshock-infinite-review-irrational-ken-levine-booker-449979 |archivedate=December 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.incgamers.com/2013/10/telltales-walking-dead-season-two-else-wed-like-see |title=Telltale’s Walking Dead Season Two: What else we’d like to see |first=Peter |last=Parrish |date=October 29, 2013 |accessdate=December 29, 2013 |publisher=IncGamers |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131109190053/http://www.incgamers.com/2013/10/telltales-walking-dead-season-two-else-wed-like-see |archivedate=November 9, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Wong2013&gt;{{Citation

Some have also inferred ''Infinite'' to be an alternate version of previous ''BioShock'' games, with comparisons being made between elements of the games such as the protagonists, antagonists, setting, and story. The story's theme of alternate universes and Elizabeth's explanation that "There's always a lighthouse, there's always a man, there's always a city" has been cited as reinforcement to this.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/03/29/the-one-twist-in-bioshock-infinite-you-might-have-missed-completely/ |title=The One Twist in BioShock Infinite's Ending You Might Have Missed Completely |first=Paul |last=Tassi |date=March 29, 2013 |accessdate=December 29, 2013 |work=[[Forbes]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130331050928/http://www.forbes.com/sites/insertcoin/2013/03/29/the-one-twist-in-bioshock-infinite-you-might-have-missed-completely/ |archivedate=March 31, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fandomania.com/constants-and-variables-bioshock-bioshock-2-and-bioshock-infinite-compared/ |title=Constants and Variables: BioShock, BioShock 2, and BioShock: Infinite Compared |first=Celeste |last=Monsour |date=April 4, 2013 |accessdate=December 29, 2013 |publisher=Fandomania |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131230235030/http://fandomania.com/constants-and-variables-bioshock-bioshock-2-and-bioshock-infinite-compared/ |archivedate=December 30, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Infinite''{{'}}s themes of [[racism]], [[religion]] and an ideological society caused controversy. In the various reveals of the Founders and Vox Populi before release, Levine and [[Irrational Games]] were criticized by various groups; upon demonstrating the Founders, people that favored the ideals of the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] including Levine's relatives felt the game was attacking that movement; on the announcement of the Vox Populi, Levine found some websites claiming the game was an attack on the [[labor movement]], and one white supremacist website claimed that "The Jew Ken Levine is making a white-person-killing simulator."&lt;ref name="pcgam political"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/13/bioshock-infinite-interview-ken-levine-racism-history/ |title=Interview: Ken Levine on American history, racism in BioShock Infinite: "I’ve always believed that gamers were underestimated." |first=Evan |last=Lahti |date=December 13, 2012 |accessdate=December 18, 2012 |work=[[PC Gamer]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121217024813/http://www.pcgamer.com/2012/12/13/bioshock-infinite-interview-ken-levine-racism-history/ |archivedate=December 17, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Levine considered that ''Infinite'', like ''BioShock'' before it, was a [[Rorschach test]] for most people, though it would be taken negatively in nature and upset them, as his vision in crafting the stories was "about not buying into a single point of view".&lt;ref name="pcgam political"/&gt; Some of the game's imagery has been used by conservative groups.

===Graphic violence===
''Infinite''{{'}}s graphic depiction of violence generated substantial discussion. [[Polygon (website)|Polygon]]'s Chris Plante considered that the degree of violence in the game could detract it to players who are more interested in the game's themes and narrative. He believed that unlike films that are based on violence as part of their themes, ''Infinite'' does not attempt to rationalize its violence, claiming the "magnitude of lives taken" and the "cold efficiency in doing so" was "unfamiliar to even the most [[exploitative films]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.polygon.com/2013/4/2/4174344/opinion-why-my-wife-wont-play-bioshock-infinite |title=Opinion: Violence limits BioShock Infinite's audience — my wife included |first=Chris |last=Plante |date=April 2, 2013 |accessdate=April 3, 2013 |publisher=[[Polygon (website)|Polygon]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130405104454/http://www.polygon.com/2013/4/2/4174344/opinion-why-my-wife-wont-play-bioshock-infinite |archivedate=April 5, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Kotaku's Kirk Hamilton agreed, stating that while violence is a common theme across video games, "[the] ridiculous violence stands out in such sharp relief when placed against the game's thoughtful story and lovely world." Hamilton acknowledged that ''Infinite'' likely would have been difficult to sell at the mass market if it lacked the first-person shooter elements, but still said that the violent kills felt "indulgent and leering" and unnecessary for the game. [[Cliff Bleszinski]], the creative lead of ''[[Gears of War (series)|Gears of War]]'', a series Bleszinski acknowledges as being purposely violent, agreed with these sentiments, saying he "felt the violence actually detracted from the experience".&lt;ref name="kotaku violence"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://kotaku.com/bioshock-infinite-is-insanely-ridiculously-violent-it-470524003 |title=BioShock Infinite Is Insanely, Ridiculously Violent. It's A Real Shame |first=Kirk |last=Hamilton |date=April 4, 2013 |accessdate=April 4, 2013 |publisher=[[Kotaku]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130408011356/http://kotaku.com/bioshock-infinite-is-insanely-ridiculously-violent-it-470524003 |archivedate=April 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Dean Takahashi of [[VentureBeat]] felt that the game's nature as a first-person shooter limited its audience appeal due to the extreme violence inherent in the genre.&lt;ref name="VentureTaka"/&gt;

Rus McLaughlin of VentureBeat stated that the sudden onset of violence at the carnival at the start of the game was a necessary element to show that "Columbia is not perfect. It's ugly, [[xenophobic]], and ready to explode." McLaughlin also considered the message carried by ''Infinite'' about the extreme nature of the violent acts Booker commits to be tied to his redemption by the end of the game, that "there can be no morality in an extreme".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2013/04/10/bioshock-infinites-extreme-violence-is-completely-valid/view-all/ |title=BioShock Infinite’s extreme violence is completely valid |first=Rus |last=McLaughlin |publisher=[[VentureBeat]] |date=April 10, 2013 |accessdate=April 10, 2013 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130413110335/http://venturebeat.com/2013/04/10/bioshock-infinites-extreme-violence-is-completely-valid/view-all |archivedate=April 13, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Sterling from [[Destructoid]] said that the violence in the game is justified because "''BioShock Infinite'' is a game about violence." He claimed that "Though he (Booker) feels guilt for what he did, he's a violent man at heart, who inescapably resorts to butchery to solve his problems" and "His entire story is one of denial." Similarly, Sterling also pointed out that "Columbia is a fake, a sham, with an atmosphere of horror under its manufactured surface." He believed that having a non-violent option would go against everything natural to the game itself and "Those asking for a non-violent ''BioShock Infinite'' are asking for a different game entirely." He claimed that those asking for a non-violent ''BioShock'' were asking for "yet more homogenization in games" and "''BioShock Infinite'' is not your game if you want a non-violent exploration of its themes, because ''Infinite''{{'}}s themes revolve around violence as a core concept".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/why-does-bioshock-infinite-need-to-be-non-violent--251424.phtml |title=Why does BioShock Infinite need to be non-violent? |first=Jim |last=Sterling |date=April 12, 2013 |accessdate=November 1, 2013 |publisher=[[Destructoid]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131103091433/http://www.destructoid.com/why-does-bioshock-infinite-need-to-be-non-violent--251424.phtml |archivedate=November 3, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Levine defended the game's depiction of violence, stating that using violence as a narrative device was as old as storytelling itself and that it was "a part of the storyteller's toolkit."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/04/04/ken-levine-game-violence/ |title=Violence is "a part of the storyteller's toolkit," says Ken Levine |first=Omri |last=Petitte |date=April 4, 2013 |accessdate=December 28, 2013 |work=[[PC Gamer]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131229035653/http://www.pcgamer.com/2013/04/04/ken-levine-game-violence |archivedate=December 29, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to say that art had a responsibility to authentically replicate and depict violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ign.com/articles/2013/12/05/ken-levine-on-bioshock-infinites-explicit-violence |title=Ken Levine on BioShock Infinite's Explicit Violence |first=Lucy |last=O'Brien |date=December 4, 2013 |accessdate=December 28, 2013 |work=[[IGN]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208041857/http://www.ign.com/articles/2013/12/05/ken-levine-on-bioshock-infinites-explicit-violence |archivedate=December 8, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He later explained that he felt "the reaction to the violence [in ''BioShock Infinite''] is more an expression of people building confidence in the industry's ability to express itself in more diverse fashions".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/06/28/326437835/modern-video-games-go-beyond-jumping-on-blocks |title=Modern Video Games Go Beyond 'Jumping On Blocks' |date=June 28, 2014 |accessdate=July 2, 2014 |publisher=[[NPR]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140702091607/http://www.npr.org/blogs/alltechconsidered/2014/06/28/326437835/modern-video-games-go-beyond-jumping-on-blocks |archivedate=July 2, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sequel==

In February 2014, while promoting ''[[BioShock Infinite: Burial at Sea|Burial at Sea: Episode Two]]'', series director [[Ken Levine (game developer)|Ken Levine]] revealed that ''BioShock Infinite'' would be [[Irrational Games]]' last game in the ''BioShock'' series, leaving the intellectual property in the hands of [[2K Games]], should they like to continue the franchise with another developer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://techland.time.com/2014/02/18/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-winding-down-irrational-games-as-you-know-it/ |title=BioShock Creator Ken Levine ‘Winding Down Irrational Games as You Know It’ |work=TIME.com |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140218210505/http://techland.time.com/2014/02/18/bioshock-creator-ken-levine-winding-down-irrational-games-as-you-know-it/ |archivedate=February 18, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; That same month, 2K Games stated that the ''BioShock'' series will continue, telling ''Game Informer'' they "look forward to exploring the next ''BioShock''". &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.comingsoon.net/news/gamenews.php?id=115118 |title=BioShock to Continue Despite Irrational Games Closure |work=ComingSoon.net |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140415115407/http://www.comingsoon.net/news/gamenews.php?id=115118 |archivedate=April 15, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In May 2014, 2K Games stated that work on the ''BioShock'' series is continuing with [[2K Marin]] at the helm.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.vg247.com/2014/05/30/bioshock-is-not-dead-future-titles-will-be-developed-by-2k-marin/ |title=BioShock is not dead, future titles will be developed by 2K Marin |first=Sharif |last=Saed |date=May 30, 2014 |accessdate=May 30, 2014 |publisher=[[VG247]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140531003725/http://www.vg247.com/2014/05/30/bioshock-is-not-dead-future-titles-will-be-developed-by-2k-marin/ |archivedate=May 31, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In a 2016 interview, Levine explained that the pressure and stress of managing a large team as he had to for ''Infinite'' had impacted his health and personal relationships, and rather than stay on to build a larger game, decided to leave the ''BioShock'' franchise.&lt;ref name="glixel sept2016"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/we-were-all-miserable-inside-bioshock-video-game-franchise-w439921 |title=Inside the Making of 'BioShock' Series With Creator Ken Levine |first=Chris |last=Suellentrop |date=September 14, 2016 |accessdate=September 15, 2016 |work=[[Rolling Stone]] |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160916112859/http://www.rollingstone.com/culture/news/we-were-all-miserable-inside-bioshock-video-game-franchise-w439921 |archivedate=September 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In an April 2018 ''[[Kotaku]]'' feature on the state of [[Hangar 13 (company)|Hangar 13]], another development studio within 2K Games (which had undergone significant restructuring after the release of ''[[Mafia III]]''), several employees stated that some Hangar 13 developers had joined a new studio in the Bay Area and were working on a project known under the [[working title]] ''Parkside'', which they stated was the next game in the ''BioShock'' franchise.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.kotaku.com/how-the-makers-of-mafia-iii-lost-their-way-1825242177/|title=How The Makers of Mafia III Lost Their Way|last=Schreier|first=Jason|date=April 13, 2018|website=[[Kotaku]]|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=May 21, 2018|quote=In the midst of all this confusion, some employees of Hangar 13 couldn’t help but look with envy at their neighbors.

Word got out, though, that it was in fact a new game in one of the most interesting shooter franchises of the past decade: BioShock.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''The Brox Sisters''' were an [[United States|American]] trio of singing sisters, enjoying their greatest popularity in the 1920s and early 1930s.

==Early life==
The sisters were:
*Lorayne (born '''Eunice''', 11 November 1901&amp;nbsp;– 14 June 1993)
*Bobbe (born '''Josephine Brock''', 28 November 1902&amp;nbsp;– 2 May 1999)
*Patricia (born '''Kathleen''', 14 June 1904&amp;nbsp;– 27 August 1988).

The family name "Brock" was changed to "Brox" for theater marquees. The trio grew up in [[Tennessee]] and retained [[Southern American English|Southern]] accents during their performing careers. 	

They began in the 1910s touring the [[Vaudeville]] circuit in the United States and Canada. At the start of the 1920s they achieved success in New York on the [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]] stage. Near the end of the decade they relocated to [[Los Angeles, California|Los Angeles]]. The act broke up in the early 1930s after the sisters got married. They made their final professional reunion appearance on radio in 1939.

==Broadway==
The trio performed in [[Irving Berlin|Irving Berlin's]] ''[[Music Box Revue]]'' from 1921 to 1924, at the [[Olympia Theatre (New York)|New York Theatre]]. Berlin's hit song "Everybody Step" was written for and debuted by the sisters.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/obituary-bobbe-brox-1094483.html Bobbe Brox obituary]&lt;/ref&gt; They recorded a number of Berlin compositions, including "Bring on the Pepper," "How Many Times," "[[Lazy (Irving Berlin song)|Lazy]]," "School House Blues," "Some Sunny Day," and "Tokio Blues."

In 1925 and 1926, they performed on Broadway in the musical comedy ''[[The Cocoanuts (musical)|The Cocoanuts]]'', with the [[Marx Brothers]]. In 1927, they appeared in the [[Ziegfeld Follies|Ziegfeld Follies of 1927]] at the [[New Amsterdam Theatre]] with [[comedian]] [[Eddie Cantor]].

==Film history==
The Brox Sisters were among the earliest artists to appear on Warner Bros.' [[Vitaphone Varieties|Vitaphone]] sound shorts in the late 1920s. They were featured in three productions: "Glorifying the American Song," "Down South" (both in 1928), and "Headin' South" (1929). None of these features currently exist in full audio and visual format, with research underway to locate missing visual or audio components.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.picking.com/vitaphone43.html The Vitaphone Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1929, they appeared in the film ''[[The Hollywood Revue of 1929]]'', performing the songs "[[Singin' in the Rain (song)|Singin' in the Rain]]" with [[Cliff Edwards]] and "[[Strike Up the Band (song)|Strike Up the Band]]" in the finale of the first act.

In 1930, the sisters appeared in the film ''[[King of Jazz]]''. They performed the song "A Bench in the Park", with [[Joe Venuti]] and [[Eddie Lang]], and with [[The Rhythm Boys]] ([[Bing Crosby]], [[Harry Barris]] and [[Al Rinker]]).  In that year they also appeared in the film ''[[Spring Is Here (film)|Spring Is Here]]'' in which they performed the song "Crying for the Carolines".

They perform "[[Falling in Love Again (Can't Help It)|Falling in Love Again]]" in the movie ''[[Hollywood on Parade]]'' (1932).

==Radio and recordings==
The sisters also made [[radio]] broadcasts in the 1920s. They recorded a series of [[gramophone record|phonograph records]] for [[Brunswick Records]] and [[Victor Records]], as well as appearing on sides for [[Columbia Records|Columbia]].

'''Caselex''' is a unique legal information service opening up national case law and other important decisions (like those of competition authorities) with a European connotation to legal professions. As such it contributes to the [[Europeanisation of law]].

== Caselex: a unique gateway to the interpretation of European law ==
Relying on a network of editors throughout Europe Caselex systematically summarizes in English case law and other decisions that have a cross border value to legal professionals. The service consists of the Caselex Market Definitions Module and several Case Law Modules. 

== Caselex Market Definitions Module ==
Defining relevant markets is crucial in concentration control and antitrust cases. The ''Caselex Market Definitions Module'' gives user friendly access to English summaries of relevant markets definitions of concentration control decisions rendered by ''all'' 34 national and European competition authorities (29 [[EU member states|EU Member States]], 4 [[EFTA and the European Union|EFTA]] countries and  [[Directorate-General for Competition|DG COMP]] of the [[European Commission]]) since 2000 up to today.

Accordingly, by giving an instant synoptic European-wide overview of all relevant markets defined it provides support to lawyers submitting notifications and to competition authorities responsible for concentration control under the [http://ec.europa.eu/competition/mergers/legislation/regulations.html EU 2004 Merger Control Regulation] as well as national rules thereon. Each product market is searchable on the basis of names of products and NACE codes and each definition backed up by the line of reasoning of the competition authority. Full texts of original decision are also available and downloadable in PDF.

Currently (October 2015), the database holds over 3.500 national and 900 DG COMP decisions holding more than 10.000 market definitions. The launch of this Module is foreseen in January 2016.

== Caselex Case Law Modules ==
Next to that Caselex covers important national case law from all EU Member States Caselex (next to case law from the [[European Court of Justice]]). Well structured English summaries allow for instant access to and full understanding of case law that would otherwise not travel across Europe. Currently (October 2015) the Modules hold almost 5.000 summaries covering the following areas of law:
* [[EU competition law|Competition Law]]
* [[Employment law|Employment Law]]
* [[Public procurement law|Public procurement Law]]
* [[Media law|ICT and Media Law]]
* [[Social Law Library|Social Security Law]]

"'''Dark Horse'''" is a song recorded by American singer [[Katy Perry]] featuring rapper [[Juicy J]]. It was originally released on September 17, 2013, by [[Capitol Records]] as the first promotional single from Perry's fourth [[studio album]], ''[[Prism (Katy Perry album)|Prism]]'' (2013). Three months later, it was released as the third official single on December 17. Both artists co-wrote the song with its producers, [[Max Martin]], [[Cirkut (record producer)|Cirkut]], and [[Dr. Luke]], alongside [[Sarah Hudson (singer)|Sarah Hudson]]. It was conceived by Perry and Hudson during a writing session in Perry's hometown of [[Santa Barbara, California]], and Juicy J was later commissioned for a verse on the song.

"Dark Horse" combines the genres of [[Trap music (hip hop)|trap]] and [[Hip hop music|hip hop]], replicating what has been described as a "[[Southern rap]]-[[techno]] mashup". The track features a minimal production, with a "seductive" and "mature" tone to Perry's vocals, while Juicy J is featured on the song's intro and [[Rapping|rapped]] [[Bridge (music)|bridge]]. Perry, in interviews, said she wanted the song to have a "witchy, [[Spell (paranormal)|spell]]-y kind of [[black magic]]-y idea", so she wrote it from the perspective of a [[witch]] warning a man not to [[falling in love|fall in love]] with her because if he does, she will be his last. The song was part of a competition sponsored by [[Pepsi]] in which fans could vote via [[Twitter]] on whether they would prefer either "Dark Horse" or "[[Walking on Air (Katy Perry song)|Walking on Air]]" to be released as the first promotional single from ''Prism''.

"Dark Horse" was a commercial success, charting at number one in Canada, the [[Netherlands]] and the United States. It also reached the top ten in almost 20 countries including [[New Zealand]], United Kingdom, [[Sweden]] and [[Venezuela]] as well as the Digital Songs chart of ''Billboard'' magazine.&lt;ref name="Caulfield"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5855135/beyonce-leads-for-third-week-at-no-1-on-billboard-200-chart |title=Beyonce Leads for Third Week at No. 1 on Billboard 200 Chart |first=Keith |last=Caulfield |work=Billboard |date=January 2, 2014 |accessdate=January 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140104075520/http://www.billboard.com/articles/news/5855135/beyonce-leads-for-third-week-at-no-1-on-billboard-200-chart |archivedate=January 4, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Billboard identified Dark Horse as cementing trap music's place on the charts.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.billboard.com/articles/events/year-in-music-2015/6804537/justin-bieber-omi-kygo-lillywood-robin-schulz-mr-probs-tropical-house-hits-2015&lt;/ref&gt; Perry first performed the song live at the 2013 [[iHeartRadio Music Festival]] in [[Las Vegas]] on September 20, 2013. The song's first major television performance was at the [[56th Annual Grammy Awards]] on January 26, 2014.&lt;ref name="GrammyPerformance2014" /&gt; "Dark Horse" was nominated for [[Grammy Award for Best Pop Duo/Group Performance|Best Pop Duo/Group Performance]] at the [[57th Annual Grammy Awards]].

Perry then asked producer [[Dr. Luke]] to contact one of his [[Kemosabe Records]] artists, American rapper [[Juicy J]], for a guest verse. Juicy J complimented Perry as having a "very professional" work ethic and being substantially involved in the song's development. He said: "My verse I did on that song, she was singing it. She's really a genius, she was by the mixing board and telling the guy what to take in and take out. She's really hands-on with her music, she knows music."&lt;ref name="Collab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.mtv.ca/news/music/katy-perrys-dark-horse-shows-off-her-genius-juicy-j-says/ |title=Katy Perry's 'Dark Horse' Shows Off Her 'Genius,' Juicy J Says |first=Rob |last=Markman |publisher=MTV News.

In a press release on August 20, 2013, [[Pepsi]] announced a partnership with Perry to promote her fourth studio album ''Prism'': a social "[[Twitter|tweet]]-to-unlock" voting program, encouraging fans to tweet the hashtag #KATYNOW in exchange for song titles and lyrics.

The music video was directed by [[Mathew Cullen]], who previously worked with Perry on her music video for the song "[[California Gurls]]". Perry's idea for the music video was to combine Ancient Egyptian culture with Memphis, Tennessee [[hip hop]]: setting the video in ancient [[Memphis, Egypt]] as a nod to Juicy J's Tennessee hometown. Speaking of Perry's concept, Cullen said "That's music to my ears — when an artist has a couple concepts that they want to mash up to create something fresh."&lt;ref name="TimeMagazine"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rothman |first=Lily |title=Katy Perry Dark Horse Music Video: Egypt Setting Gets OK from Experts |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2014/02/21/katy-perry-dark-horse-egypt/ |magazine=Time |accessdate=February 24, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140223223043/http://entertainment.time.com/2014/02/21/katy-perry-dark-horse-egypt/ |archivedate=February 23, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Synopsis===
[[File:Dark Horse Disintegration.png|thumb|right|The video was criticized for including a scene where Perry's character disintegrated a man (pictured), originally seen wearing a pendant appearing to display the [[Arabic language|Arabic]] word for "[[Allah]]", which was subsequently edited out of the video]]
During the video's opening, it is revealed that the music video takes place "a crazy long time ago" in [[Memphis, Egypt]]. For the opening verses, Perry's character Katy Pätra, the witch of Memphis, is shown wearing a white dress and white and blue wig while floating on a large [[barge]] at sunset, with pyramids and palm trees visible in the background. The video transitions to a different scene where Pätra, now wearing a longer dress and a black wig, sits in an extravagant [[Sphinx]]-like throne while pharaohs gather to bring her expensive gifts (such as a large [[diamond]]) in an attempt to "win her heart."

After retrieving the first suitor's gift, she hits the man with a magical bolt of lightning from her hand, turning him into a pile of sand, and takes his jewels to wear on her teeth as a [[grill (jewelry)|grill]]. Another suitor brings her [[candy]], [[cupcake]]s, [[twinkie]]s, and spicy [[cheese puffs]]. After she burns her mouth with the spicy cheese puffs, she turns the suitor into a large cup of water, which she drinks. Pätra also appears as a gray statue in a scene where golden pythons and gray guardian statues such as [[Anubis]], [[Horus]], [[Nisroch]] and [[Apep]] surround her, and in a scene with a blue background where she wears a golden dress and several golden hieroglyphs levitate around her.

During Juicy J's verse, the rapper emerges from a gold [[sarcophagus]] while Pätra accepts an Egyptian chariot with hydraulics (she turns the associated suitor into a set of giant dice to hang from the frame) and rejects a suitor who turns out to have the [[Sobek|face of a crocodile]] by turning him into a wallet. During the final chorus, the last suitor brings Pätra a large gold pyramid with a pink capstone, which she ascends. At the top of the pyramid, Pätra, dressed as [[Isis]], uses her powers to conjure up a magical "perfect storm" with pink, purple, and violet clouds. Although it seems like Pätra has finally found a gift she likes, the final frame of the video reveals that she has turned the final suitor into a dog with a human head.

===Reception===
The music video was criticized by some for appropriating the symbols and imagery of Egyptian culture. Cullen, the director, defended the music video, saying that, while he believes it is dangerous to rip things directly from present cultures without adding anything to them, Ancient Egypt is part of what he calls our "shared collective mythology". He said: "The most important thing is that when you create something, and this is actually something Katy and I worked to do — you bring a new spin to it." Egyptologist [[David P. Silverman]] praised the music video's use of Egyptian imagery and the interest it could generate to viewers: "[Egypt has] always been a part of popular culture. It encourages people to think of these things, and some of those people actually begin to learn a lot." The video was noted by conspiracy theorists for bearing resemblance to imagery used by the alleged [[Illuminati]], but Ritner rejected the allegations, saying that "The many discussions of the Illuminati are nonsense" and that, in fact, the [[Freemasonry|masonic]] imagery associated with the Illuminati is drawn from Egyptian imagery (as a common source for both).&lt;ref name="TimeMagazine" /&gt;

On June 9, 2015, the music video for "Dark Horse" became the first video by a female artist to reach 1 billion views on [[Vevo]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Katy Perry's 'Dark Horse' Passes 1 Billion Vevo Views |first=Erin |last=Strecker |url=http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6590902/katy-perry-dark-horse-1-billion-vevo-views |magazine=Billboard |date=June 10, 2015 |accessdate=June 10, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150612233806/http://www.billboard.com/articles/columns/pop-shop/6590902/katy-perry-dark-horse-1-billion-vevo-views |archivedate=June 12, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Katy Perry Just Beat Taylor Swift To A Huge Milestone |first=Gil |last=Kaufman |url=http://www.mtv.com/news/2181184/katy-perry-dark-horse-billion-video-taylor-swift/ |publisher=MTV News |date=June 9, 2015 |accessdate=June 9, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150610090021/http://www.mtv.com/news/2181184/katy-perry-dark-horse-billion-video-taylor-swift/ |archivedate=June 10, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Perry also became the first female to have a video on [[YouTube]] with 1 billion views.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/music/news/a31487/katy-perry-just-left-taylor-swift-in-the-dust-on-youtube/ |title=Katy Perry Just Left Taylor Swift in the Dust on YouTube |publisher=[[Seventeen (American magazine)]] |accessdate=August 1, 2015 |date=June 9, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150723153039/http://www.seventeen.com/celebrity/music/news/a31487/katy-perry-just-left-taylor-swift-in-the-dust-on-youtube/ |archivedate=July 23, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 2018, the video has received over 2.4 billion views on YouTube, making it the [[List of most viewed YouTube videos#All-time|fourteenth most viewed video of all time]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Most Viewed Videos of All Time (Over 375 million views) |url=https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLirAqAtl_h2r5g8xGajEwdXd3x1sZh8hC |publisher=YouTube |accessdate=July 7, 2015 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160809182529/https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLirAqAtl_h2r5g8xGajEwdXd3x1sZh8hC |archivedate=August 9, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Accusations of blasphemy====
The music video caused controversy among some [[Muslim]]s who criticized a scene in the video where a man wearing a [[pendant]] appearing to display the [[Arabic]] word for "[[Allah]]" is disintegrated and turned into sand by Perry's character. The scene took place 1 minute and 15 seconds into the video. A petition launched on [[Change.org]] accused Perry of "representing an opposition of God" and demanded that the video be taken down from [[YouTube]]. The petition reached over 65,000 signatures and as a response, the pendant was digitally removed from the video on February 26, 2014, after which the petition was closed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Katy Perry Dark Horse video edited |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26366249 |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=February 27, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140227124602/http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/entertainment-arts-26366249 |archivedate=February 27, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Copyright infringement lawsuit==
On July 1, 2014, the ''[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]]'' reported that Christian rapper [[Flame (rapper)|Flame]] and others filed a lawsuit against Perry, Capitol Records, and Perry's co-writers for infringing copyright on the song "Joyful Noise", which appeared on the 2008 album ''[[Our World: Redeemed]]''.&lt;ref name="post-dispatch"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Patrick |first1=Robert |title=St. Louis Christian hip-hop singers sue Katy Perry over 'Dark Horse' |url=http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/st-louis-christian-hip-hop-singers-sue-katy-perry-over/article_a18ee60f-8f8d-5e5e-bdb1-cbfaff93597d.html |website=[[St. Louis Post-Dispatch]] |accessdate=July 3, 2014 |date=July 1, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140820073736/http://www.stltoday.com/news/local/crime-and-courts/st-louis-christian-hip-hop-singers-sue-katy-perry-over/article_a18ee60f-8f8d-5e5e-bdb1-cbfaff93597d.html |archivedate=August 20, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Flame's DJ, Cho'zyn Boy, stated that Perry's song is "identical" to "Joyful Noise", but ten BPM slower in tempo and one step higher in pitch.&lt;ref name="rapzilla"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Daniels |first1=David |title=Flame's DJ Explains Why 'Joyful Noise' and Katy Perry's 'Dark Horse' Are Similar |url=http://www.rapzilla.com/rz/news/38-backstage/8695-flames-dj-explains-why-joyful-noise-and-katy-perrys-dark-horse-are-similar |website=[[Rapzilla]] |publisher=Philip Rood and Chad Horton |accessdate=July 3, 2014 |date=July 2, 2014 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140706182725/http://www.rapzilla.com/rz/news/38-backstage/8695-flames-dj-explains-why-joyful-noise-and-katy-perrys-dark-horse-are-similar |archivedate=July 6, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the infringement claims, the suit claims that "by any measure, the devoutly religious message of 'Joyful Noise' has been irreparably tarnished by its association with the witchcraft, paganism, black magic, and Illuminati imagery evoked by the same music in 'Dark Horse'".&lt;ref name="huffpo"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Sieczkowski |first1=Cavan |title=Christian Singers Sue Katy Perry Over 'Dark Horse' |url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2014/07/02/christian-singers-sue-katy-perry-dark-horse-_n_5552496.html |publisher=[[The Huffington Post]].

On February 1, 2015, the song was performed by Perry during the [[Super Bowl XLIX halftime show]], where she was on a chessboard, with her dancers as chess pieces.

The film depicts the last two years of the princess's life, beginning with events when [[Diana, Princess of Wales|Diana]] ([[Naomi Watts]]) divorces [[Charles, Prince of Wales]].  She meets and falls in love with Pakistani [[Cardiac surgery|heart surgeon]], [[Hasnat Khan]] ([[Naveen Andrews]]).   The film depicts her historic tours of [[Angola]], in her campaign against the use of land mines.  Trips to causes in  [[Australia]], [[Pakistan]], [[New York City]], [[Bosnia]], [[Italy]], and ultimately, [[Paris]] are also shown, with recreations of the fashions she wore in real life. Her desire for a life with Khan ends due to his wish for a private life and objections to her celebrity.  The film depicts her dating of Egyptian [[Dodi Fayed]] as an attempt to make Khan jealous, but it ends with the car crash that killed Diana, Fayed, and Fayed's driver in the [[Pont de l'Alma|Pont Alma Tunnel]], in [[Paris]] – however, there is no re-enactment of the crash scene.

==Reception==
The film has received overwhelmingly negative reviews.&lt;ref name="BBC'" /&gt; On review aggregator ''[[Rotten Tomatoes]]'', it has an 8% approval rating based on reviews from 97 critics and an average score of 3.5/10. The consensus states: "Naomi Watts tries hard in the title role, but ''Diana'' buries her efforts under a shoddy script and clumsy direction."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/diana_2013/ |title=Diana |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Flixster]] |accessdate=23 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a 35 (out of 100), based on 28 reviews.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/diana/ |title=Diana |work=[[Metacritic]] |accessdate=14 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Edwards from ''[[Daily Mirror|The Mirror]]'' said it was a "cheap and cheerless effort that looks like a [[Channel 5 (UK)|Channel 5]] mid-week matinee" and that "[[Wesley Snipes]] in a blonde wig would be more convincing", awarding the film one star out of five.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/lifestyle/going-out/film/diana-film-review-naomi-watts-2254659 |title=Diana film review |publisher=The Mirror |date=6 September 2013 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Peter Bradshaw]] of ''[[The Guardian]]'' also awarded it one star out of five and called the film "car crash cinema".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2013/sep/05/diana-review |title=Diana – review |work=The Guardian |date=6 September 2013 |accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joshua Rothkopf of ''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out New York]]'' called Watts's performance "extraordinary" and gave the film 3 stars out of 5, calling it "a restrained biopic that affords its subject the romantic privacy that life denied her."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.timeout.com/us/film/diana-movie-review |title=Diana: movie review (PG-13) |work=''[[Time Out (magazine)|Time Out New York]]'' |date=29 October 2013 |accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nigel Andrews]] of the ''[[Financial Times]]'' said that "once again Watts supplies the wattage" but that her performance is "frighteningly isolated... the compensating passion in a torpid drama."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/2/e1034134-210e-11e3-8aff-00144feab7de.html |title=Film reviews: Diana, Hawking, InRealLife, Kelly + Victor, The Call and Metro Manila |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=19 September 2013 |accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jim Schembri of [[3AW]] praised Watts' "impressive performance" but remarked that the film "could actually have done with another half-hour putting more meat onto the bones of these underdeveloped chapters of her story. "&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.3aw.com.au/blogs/denis-walter-blog/new-release-movie-reviews--october-10/20131010-2v9vn.html |title=New release movie reviews - October 10 |work=[[3AW]] |date=10 October 2013 |accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dominic Corry of flicks.co.nz called the film "bad in the blandest way possible" and lamented that "Watts is let down by the [[Mills &amp; Boon]]-level script".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flicks.co.nz/blog/reviews/review-diana/ |title=REVIEW: DIANA |work=flicks.co.nz |date=10 October 2013 |accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fionnuala Halligan of ''[[Screen International|Screen Daily]]'' also criticised the writing, saying that Watts' "brave performance should not be under-estimated given the poverty of the dialogue and the pressure of the part."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.screendaily.com/reviews/the-latest/diana/5060086.article |title=Diana |work=''[[Screen International|Screen Daily]]'' |date=6 September 2013 |accessdate=30 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Naomi Watts received a [[Razzie Award]] nomination for Worst Actress for her work in both this film and ''[[Movie 43]]'', where she lost to [[Tyler Perry]] for his performance in drag in ''[[A Madea Christmas (film)|A Madea Christmas]]''.

== Plot ==
Dill Mill Gayye follows the lives of surgical interns and resident doctors of Sanjeevani. Set in the backdrop of Sanjeevani Hospital, it deals with the pressures, drama, romance, inter personal relationships and humour in their lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Dil Mil Gaye |url=http://starone.indya.com/serials/dmg/ |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091120062130/http://starone.indya.com/serials/dmg/ |archivedate=20 November 2009 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Season 1 (2007–09) ===
The first season follows the lives of surgical interns and resident doctors of Sanjeevani. At the start of the show the interns are Dr. Anjali Gupta, Dr. Armaan Malik, Dr. Riddhima Gupta, Dr. Atul Joshi, and Dr. Sapna Shah. Dr. Shashank Gupta is head of the hospital, and the father of Anjali and Riddhima. 

During the course of the show, Armaan and Riddhima fall in love, Atul falls in love with Anjali, and Sapna Shah gets married and leaves Sanjeevani. Three new interns enter: Dr. Rahul Garewal, Dr. Muskaan Chadda, and Dr Nikita Malhotra. Muskaan and Rahul's families intend for them to marry, but they do not want to do so. Muskaan falls in love with Armaan and Rahul and Riddhima become friends. Nikita turns out to be Armaan's and Rahul's college friend. Muskaan and Rahul have a romantic relationship for some time. Nikita falls in love with Dr. Abhimanyu Modi, a senior doctor.  Season one ended on a [[cliffhanger]] showing Riddhima and Armaan getting shot in a shootout right after they get engaged and Abhimanyu's estranged wife Jiah returns.

A '''diner''' is a small restaurant found predominantly in the [[Northeastern United States]] and [[Midwest]]{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}, as well as in other parts of the US, [[Canada]], and parts of [[Western Europe]]. Diners offer a wide range of foods, mostly [[American cuisine]], a casual atmosphere, and, characteristically, a combination of booths served by a waitstaff and a long sit-down counter with direct service, in the smallest simply by a cook. Many diners have extended hours, and some along highways and areas with significant [[shift work]] may stay open 24 hours.
 
Even today many diners share an archetypal exterior form.  Some of the earliest were converted rail cars, retaining their streamlined structure and interior fittings.  From the 1920s to the 1940s, diners, by then commonly known as "lunch cars", were usually [[prefabrication|prefabricated]] in factories like modern [[mobile home]]s and delivered on site with only the utilities needing to be connected. As a result, many early diners were typically small and narrow in order to fit onto a rail car or truck.  This small footprint also allowed them to be fitted into tiny and relatively inexpensive lots that otherwise were unable to support a larger enterprise.  Diners were historically [[small business]]es operated by the owner, with some presence of restaurant chains evolving over time.

Diners typically serve staples of American cuisine such as [[hamburger]]s, [[french fries]], [[club sandwich]]es, and other simple, quickly cooked, and inexpensive fare, such as [[meatloaf]]. Much of the food is [[flattop grill|grilled]], as early diners were based around a gas-fueled flat-top. [[Coffee]] is a diner staple. Diners often serve hand-blended [[milkshake]]s and desserts such as [[pie]]s, which are typically displayed in a glass case. [[Comfort food]] cuisine draws heavily from, and is deeply rooted in, traditional diner fare.

Classic American diners often have an exterior layer of [[stainless steel]] siding—a feature unique to diner architecture. In some cases, diners share nostalgic, retro style features also found in some restored [[drive-in]]s and old [[movie theatre]]s.

==History==
[[File:Rosebud Diner.jpg|thumb|[[The Rosebud (diner)|The Rosebud]], a restored 1941 [[Worcester Lunch Car Company|Worcester Lunch Car]] #773 in [[Somerville, Massachusetts]]]]

A crude precursor of the diner was created in 1872 by Walter Scott, who sold food out of a horse-pulled wagon to employees of the ''[[Providence Journal]]'', in [[Providence, Rhode Island]]. Scott's diner can be considered the first diner with [[Walk-up window|walk-up]] service, as it had windows on each side of the wagon.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Commercial production of such "lunch wagons" began in [[Worcester, Massachusetts|Worcester]], [[Massachusetts]], in 1887, by Thomas Buckley. Buckley was successful and became known for his "White House Cafe" wagons. Charles Palmer received the first patent (1893) for the diner, which he billed as a "Night-Lunch Wagon." He built his "fancy night cafes" and "night lunch wagons" in the Worcester area until 1901.

===Prefabricated diners===
As the number of seats increased, wagons gave way to pre-fabricated buildings made by many of the same manufacturers which had made the wagons. Like the lunch wagon, a stationary diner allowed one to set up a food service business quickly using pre-assembled constructs and equipment.

The [[Transfer Station (Hudson County)|Transfer Station]] neighborhood of [[Union City, New Jersey]] was the site, in 1912, of the first lunch wagon built by Jerry and Daniel O'Mahoney and John Hanf, which was bought for $800 and operated by restaurant entrepreneur Michael Griffin, who chose the location for its copious foot traffic. The wagon helped spark New Jersey's golden age of diner manufacturing, which in turn made the state the diner capital of the world. In the decades that followed, nearly all major U.S. diner manufacturers, including Jerry O'Mahoney Inc., started in New Jersey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|author=Gabriele, Michael C.|title=Jersey Gems|magazine=[[New Jersey Monthly]]|date=May 2018|page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jerry O'Mahony (1890-1969), who hailed from [[Bayonne, New Jersey]],  is credited by some to have made the first such "diner".&lt;ref&gt;p.16 Westergaard, Barbara ''A Guide to New Jersey'' Rutgers University Press&lt;/ref&gt; The O'Mahony Diner Company of [[Elizabeth, New Jersey]], produced 2,000 diners from 1917 to 1952.  Only approximately twenty&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dinercity.com|title=Loading...|author=|date=|website=www.DinerCity.com|access-date=October 21, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; remain throughout the United States and abroad.  Others more credibly credit Philip H. Duprey and Grenville Stoddard, who established the Worcester Lunch Car and Carriage Manufacturing Company in Worcester, Massachusetts, in 1906, when O'Mahony was still just 16.

Until the [[Great Depression]], most diner manufacturers and their customers were located in the Northeast. Diner manufacturing suffered with other industries during the Depression, though not as much as many industries, and the diner offered a less expensive way of getting into the restaurant business as well as less expensive food than more formal establishments. After [[World War II]], as the economy returned to civilian production and the [[suburb]]s boomed, diners were an attractive [[small business]] opportunity. During this period, diners spread beyond their original urban and small town market to highway strips in the suburbs, even reaching the [[Midwest]], with manufacturers such as Valentine. After the [[Interstate Highway System]] was implemented in the U.S. in the 1960s, diners saw a boom in business as mobile travellers would stop for a meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.curbed.com/2017/5/30/15716116/restaurants-diners-prefab-historic-preservation|title=Diners, the original prefab success story|author=|date=|website=curbed.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Bendix Diner.jpg|thumb|left|The Bendix Diner in [[Hasbrouck Heights, New Jersey]]]]
In many areas, diners were superseded in the 1970s by [[fast food]] restaurants, but in parts of [[New Jersey]], [[New York (state)|New York]], the [[New England]] states, [[Delaware]], and [[Pennsylvania]], the independently-owned diner remains relatively common. Since the 1970s, most newly constructed diners lack the original narrow, stainless steel, streamlined appearance, and are usually much bigger buildings, though some are still made of several prefabricated modules, assembled on site, and manufactured by the old line diner builders. A wide variety of architectural styles were now used for these later diners, including [[Cape Cod (house)|Cape Cod]] and [[Colonial architecture|Colonial]] styles. The old-style single module diners featuring a long counter and a few small booths sometimes now grew additional dining rooms, lavish [[wallpaper]], fountains, crystal [[chandelier]]s and Greek statuary. The definition of the term "diner" began to blur as older, prefabricated diners received more conventional frame additions, sometimes leaving the original structure nearly unrecognizable as it was surrounded by new construction or a renovated [[facade]]. Businesses that called themselves diners but which were built onsite and not prefabricated began to appear. These larger establishments were sometimes known as diner-restaurants.

*Sterling Streamliner diners
Inspired by the streamlined trains, and especially the [[Burlington Zephyr]], Roland Stickney designed a diner in the shape of a streamlined train called the Sterling Streamliner in 1939.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|pages=76–78|last=Witzel|first=Michael Karl|title=The American Diner|year=2006|publisher=MBI Publishing|isbn=978-0-7603-0110-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Built by the [[John B Judkins Company|J.B. Judkins]] coach company, which had built custom car bodies,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uglyinvestments.net/auto/details.aspx?id=61 |title=1939 Sterling Diner |publisher=Antique Car Investments |date= |accessdate=2010-08-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Sterling and other diner production ceased in 1942 at the beginning of American involvement in World War II. Two Sterling Streamliners remain in operation: the [[Salem Diner]] at its original location in [[Salem, Massachusetts]] and the [[Modern Diner]] in [[Pawtucket, Rhode Island]].

==Architecture==
[[File:Wellsboro Diner interior.jpg|thumb|Interior of a 1938 Sterling manufactured diner, with curved ceiling, in [[Wellsboro, Pennsylvania]]]]
Like a [[mobile home]], the original style diner is narrow and elongated and allows roadway or railway transportation to the restaurant's site. In the traditional diner floorplan, a service counter dominates the interior, with a preparation area against the back wall and floor-mounted stools for the customers in front. Larger models may have a row of booths against the front wall and at the ends. The decor varied over time. Diners of the 1920s&amp;ndash;1940s feature [[Art Deco]] or [[Streamline Moderne]] elements or copy the appearance of rail dining cars (though very few are, in fact, refurbished rail cars). They featured porcelain enamel exteriors, some with the name written on the front, others with bands of enamel, others in flutes. Many had a "barrel vault" roofline. Tile floors were common. Diners of the 1950s tended to use [[stainless steel]] panels, porcelain enamel, glass blocks, [[terrazzo]] floors, [[Formica (plastic)|Formica]], and [[neon sign]] trim. Diners built in the 2000s generally have a different type of architecture; they are laid out more like restaurants, retaining some aspects of traditional diner architecture (stainless steel and Art Deco elements, usually) while discarding others (the small size, and emphasis on the counter).

==Cultural significance==
[[File:Nighthawks by Edward Hopper 1942.jpg|thumb|300px|[[Edward Hopper]]'s iconic ''[[Nighthawks]]'' (1942) captured the ambiance of an urban diner at night]]
Diners attract a wide spectrum of the local populations, and are generally [[small business]]es. From the mid-twentieth century onwards, they have been seen as [[culture of the United States|quintessentially American]], reflecting the perceived cultural diversity and [[Egalitarianism|egalitarian]] nature of the country at large. Throughout much of the 20th century, diners, particularly in the [[Northeastern United States|Northeast]], were often owned and operated by [[Greek-American]] immigrant families. The presence of Greek casual food, like [[Gyro (food)|gyros]] and [[souvlaki]], on several diners' menus, testifies to this cultural link.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Joseph|last= Berger|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Diners in Changing Hands; Greek Ownership on the Wane  |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2008/03/16/nyregion/nyregionspecial2/16Rdinersnj.html |quote= |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=March 16, 2008 |accessdate=2009-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first= Dena|last= Kleiman|authorlink= |coauthors= |title=Greek Diners, Where Anything Is Possible |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/02/27/garden/greek-diners-where-anything-is-possible.html?pagewanted=all |quote=... Greeks became a visible presence in the diner and coffee shop business in the late 1950s after several waves of immigration. They congregated largely on the East Coast, where the food service industry provided an easy economic foothold for many immigrants who were often unskilled and unable to speak English. As with immigrants from many nations, one relative would send word of opportunity back home, encouraging others to come to America. |work=The New York Times |date=February 27, 1991 |accessdate=2009-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Diners frequently stay open 24 hours a day, especially in cities, and were once America's most widespread 24-hour public establishments, making them an essential part of urban culture, alongside bars and nightclubs; these two segments of nighttime urban culture often find themselves intertwined, as many diners get a good deal of late-night business from persons departing drinking establishments. Many diners were also historically placed near factories which operated 24 hours a day, with [[shift work|night shift]] workers providing a key part of the customer base. All this meant diners could serve as symbols of loneliness and isolation. [[Edward Hopper|Edward Hopper's]] iconic 1942 painting ''[[Nighthawks]]'' depicts a diner and its occupants, late at night. The diner in the painting is based on a real location in [[Greenwich Village]], but was chosen in part because diners were anonymous slices of Americana, meaning that the scene could have been taken from any city in the country-and also because a diner was a place to which isolated individuals, awake long after bedtime, would naturally be drawn. The spread of the diner meant that by 1942 it was possible for Hopper to cast this institution in a role for which, fifteen years earlier, he had used an [[Automat (painting)|Automat]] all-night restaurant.

But as a rule, diners were always symbols of American optimism. [[Norman Rockwell]] made his 1958 painting, ''The Runaway'', generically American by placing his subjects, a young boy and a protective highway patrolman, at the counter of an anonymous diner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artgalleryartist.com/norman-rockwell/art/the-runaway.jpg Norman Rockwell - ''The Runaway'']&lt;/ref&gt; In television and cinema (e.g. ''[[The Blob]]'', ''[[Happy Days]]'', ''[[Grease (film)|Grease]]'' and ''[[Diner (film)|Diner]]''), diners and [[soda fountain]]s have come to symbolize the period of prosperity and optimism in America in the 1950s. They are shown as the place where [[teenager]]s meet after school and as an essential part of a [[courtship|date]].  The television show ''[[Alice (TV series)|Alice]]'' used a diner as the setting for the program, and one is often a regular feature in [[sitcom]]s such as [[Seinfeld]]. The diner's cultural influence continues today. Many non-prefab restaurants (including franchises like [[Denny's]]) have copied the look of 1950s diners for [[nostalgia|nostalgic]] appeal, while [[Waffle House]] uses an interior layout derived from the diner.

Manhattan was once known for its diners. The [[Moondance Diner]] was shipped to [[Wyoming]] to make room for development.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/ny_local/2008/08/16/2008-08-16_moondance_diner_gathering_dust_in_wyomin.html | location=New York | work=Daily News | title=Moondance diner gathering dust in Wyoming one year after move | first=Kristen V. | last=Brown | date=August 16, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Diners provide a nationwide, recognizable, fairly uniform place to eat and assemble, desirable traits mirrored by [[fast food|fast food chains]]. The types of food served are likely to be consistent, especially within a region (exceptions being districts with large immigrant populations, in which diners and [[café|coffee shop]]s will often cater their menus to those local cuisines), as are the prices charged. At the same time, diners have much more individuality than fast food chains; the structures, menus, and even owners and staff, while having a certain degree of similarity to each other, vary much more widely than the more rigidly standardized chain and franchise restaurants. The [[Poirier's Diner]] and [[Munson Diner]], both manufactured by the [[Kullman Dining Car Company]] of [[Lebanon, New Jersey]], are listed on the [[National Register of Historic Places]].&lt;ref name="nris"&gt;{{NRISref|2009a}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cuisine==

[[File:NYC-Diner-ToGo-Cheeseburger-Deluxe.jpg|thumb|left|upright=0.7|A bacon cheeseburger from a New York City diner in a to-go container. Comes with a pickle slice, onion rings, coleslaw and french fries.]]
[[File:Milkshakes at Mels Diner.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|Many diners serve a metal cup alongside a milkshake, containing what cannot fit in the glass]]
Diners almost invariably serve American food such as [[hamburger]]s, [[french fries]], [[club sandwich]]es, and other simple fare. Much of the food is grilled, as early diners were based around a [[grill (cooking)|grill]]. There is often an emphasis on [[breakfast]] foods such as [[egg (food)|eggs]] (including [[omelette]]s), [[waffle]]s, [[pancake]]s, and [[French toast]]. Like the British [[greasy spoon]], the typical American diner serves mainly fried or grilled food, for example: [[Egg (food)|fried eggs]], [[bacon]], hamburgers, [[hot dog]]s, [[hash brown]]s, waffles, pancakes, omelettes, deep fried [[Chicken (food)|chicken]], [[patty melt]]s, and [[sausage]]s. These are often accompanied by [[baked beans]], french fries, [[cole slaw]], or [[toast]]. Some diners serve these "breakfast foods" throughout the business day and others who focus on breakfast may close at around 3 pm.  These are most commonly known as [[pancake house]]s. [[Coffee]] is ubiquitous at diners, if not always of high quality. Many diners do not serve [[alcoholic drink]]s, although some may serve beer and inexpensive wine, while others—particularly in New Jersey and on Long Island—carry a full drink menu, including [[mixed drinks]]. Many diners serve hand-blended [[milkshake]]s. The food is usually quite inexpensive, with a decent meal (sandwich, side dish, drink) available for less than ten dollars.

There is regional variation among diners with traditional regional American food. In [[Michigan]] and the Ohio Valley at "[[Coney Island (restaurant)|Coney Island]]–style" restaurants, [[Coney Island hot dog|coney dogs]] are served, as are certain types of [[Greek cuisine]] like [[Gyro (food)|gyros]] influenced by Greek diner owners. In [[Indiana]] and [[Illinois]], fried pork tenderloin sandwiches are typically on the menu. The Northeast has more of a focus on seafood, with [[clams|fried clams]] and [[shrimp|fried shrimp]] commonly found in [[Maine]]. In [[Pennsylvania]], [[cheesesteak]] sandwiches and [[scrapple]] are fixtures in most diners. Diners in the southwest serve [[Tamal (dish)|tamal]]es. In the southern U.S., typical breakfast dishes include [[grits]], [[biscuits and gravy]], and [[soul food]] such as [[fried chicken]] and [[collard greens]]. In New Jersey, the "[[Pork roll]], Egg, and Cheese Sandwich" is a staple of many diners. Many diners have transparent display cases in or behind the counter for the [[dessert]]s. It is common with new diners to have the desserts displayed in rotating pie cases.  Typical desserts include a variety of [[pie]]s, often on view in a separate transparent case. Most diners in New York and Chicago also offer [[cheesecake]].

==Immigrant influences==
{{unreferenced section|date=November 2017}}
{{original research section|date=November 2017}}
Several foreign ethnic influences have been introduced into the diner industry. Many diners in the United States — especially in New Jersey, Illinois, New York, Massachusetts, Pennsylvania, and Connecticut — are owned or operated by [[Greeks|Greek]] Americans. Eastern European owners, chiefly Polish, Ukrainian, and Eastern European Jews, are also typical. [[Italian people|Italian]] Americans also have a notable presence. And in some places where there are significant [[Latino]] populations, [[Mexican people|Mexicans]] and [[Cuban people|Cubans]] may also have notable presences. These influences can be seen in certain frequent additions to diner menus, such as Greek [[moussaka]], Slavic [[blintz]]es, and Jewish [[matzah balls|matzah ball soup]], deli-style sandwiches (e.g., corned beef, pastrami, Reubens), and bagels and lox.

==In media==
[[File:Jax At The Tracks, Truckee.jpg|thumb|The diner ''Jax At The Tracks'' in [[Truckee]], California, was featured in the food reality television series ''[[Diners, Drive-Ins and Dives]]'' in June 2010]]
[[File:John's Diner by John Baeder.jpg|thumb|[[John Baeder]], 2007, ''John's Diner with John's Chevelle'']]

Diners have figured significantly in American films and television since the form developed. In ''[[I Love Lucy]]'', the episode titled 'The Diner' shows the perils, pitfalls, and difficulty in operating a diner, to much comedic effect. Archetypal appearances include significant scenes in classic films such as ''[[Sullivan's Travels]]'' and ''[[The Killers]]''.  The 1982 "rites of passage" film [[Diner (film)|''Diner'']] was centered on an eatery shared by the protagonists.  ''[[Waitress (film)|Waitress]]'' in 2007 was about a [[waiting staff|waitress]] in a diner.,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eater.com/2015/1/30/7934459/the-history-of-diner-waitress-uniforms|title=How Diner Waitress Uniforms Have Evolved From Scandalous Bloomers to Gingham Dresses|publisher=Eater|language=English|author=Jennifer Wright|date=30 January 2015|accessdate=8 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Television series include the [[Food Network]] show ''[[Diners, Drive-Ins, and Dives]]''.  ''[[Pennsylvania Diners and Other Roadside Restaurants]]'', is a 1993 documentary.

The diner as an institution was iconically captured by painter Edward Hopper in his 1942 ''Nighthawks'', a vignette mimicked by a movie lead-in aired nightly on the [[Turner Classic Movies|Turner Classic Movie Channel]].  Diners are the focus of [[Photorealism|photorealist]] painter [[John Baeder]] who spent about 40 years painting diners across the US.

The '''Fake News Awards''' was created by U.S. President [[Donald Trump]] to highlight the news outlets he said were responsible for misrepresenting him or producing false reports both before, and during, his presidency. On January 17, 2018, a post to the blog of the [[GOP]] website announced the winners.&lt;ref name="Siddiqui"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/us-news/2018/jan/17/trump-fake-news-awards-winners |title=Donald Trump faces backlash as he reveals 'Fake News Awards' winners |last1=Siddiqui |first1=Sabrina |date=January 18, 2018 |newspaper=The Guardian|access-date=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; They included errors by journalists on social media and news reports that later issued [[Correction (newspaper)|corrections]].&lt;ref name="Siddiqui"/&gt;

==Creation==
President Trump first proposed an award—then called the "Fake News Trophy"—in a November 2017 [[Twitter|tweet]], stating "We should have a contest as to which of the Networks, plus CNN and not including Fox, is the most dishonest, corrupt and/or distorted in its political coverage of your favorite President (me)."&lt;ref name="Borchers"&gt;{{cite news |last=Borchers |first=Callum |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2018/01/17/trumps-fake-news-awards-are-shaping-up-to-be-a-total-flop/ |title=Trump's 'Fake News Awards' were a huge flop |work=[[The Washington Post]] |date=January 17, 2018|access-date=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time, it was unclear whether he intended to actually create the award.&lt;ref name="Grynbaum"&gt;{{cite news |last=Grynbaum |first=Michael M. |last2=Flegenheimer |first2=Matt |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/17/business/media/fake-news-awards.html |title=Trump Hands Out 'Fake News Awards,' Sans the Red Carpet |date=January 17, 2018 |work=[[The New York Times]]|access-date=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In late December, Trump's re-election campaign sent emails to supporters with a link to an online poll asking them to rank three nominated stories as "fake," "faker" or "fakest" news.&lt;ref name=Anapol-Fake&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anapol|first1=Avery|title=Trump asks supporters to help award 'Fake News' trophy|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/administration/366676-trump-asks-supporters-asking-to-award-fake-news-trophy|work=TheHill|date=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Borchers|first1=Callum|title=Trump’s ‘fake news trophy’ contest is now an actual thing|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/the-fix/wp/2017/12/28/trumps-fake-news-trophy-contest-is-now-an-actual-thing/|work=Washington Post|date=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Trump next mentioned the awards in a January 2, 2018 tweet. At this time, he called them the "Most Dishonest &amp; Corrupt Media Awards of the Year", and wrote they would be awarded for "dishonesty &amp; bad reporting in various categories". The awards were scheduled for January 8, 2018 at 5pm [[Central Standard Time|CST]].&lt;ref name="Watson"&gt;{{cite news |last=Watson |first=Kathryn |title=Trump tweets he will announce awards for most 'dishonest' and 'corrupt' media of the year |url=https://www.cbsnews.com/news/trump-to-announce-awards-for-most-dishonest-and-corrupt-media-of-the-year/ |newspaper=[[CBS News]] |date=January 2, 2018|access-date=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a January 7 tweet, Trump changed the date to January 17, citing increased interest in the award.&lt;ref name="Stewart"&gt;{{cite news |last=Stewart |first=Emily |url=https://www.vox.com/policy-and-politics/2018/1/17/16900824/john-mccain-trump-press |title=John McCain to Donald Trump: stop attacking the press |date=January 17, 2018 |work=[[Vox (website)|Vox]]|access-date=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several late-night talk show hosts, including [[Samantha Bee]] and [[Jimmy Kimmel]], satirically campaigned for an award. ''[[The Late Show with Stephen Colbert]]'' displayed a billboard doing such in New York City's [[Times Square]], with categories including "Least [[Breitbart]]y" and "Corruptest Fakeness",&lt;ref name="Grynbaum"/&gt; and [[Trevor Noah]]'s ''[[The Daily Show]]'' bought a full-page ad in ''[[The New York Times]]''.&lt;ref name="Serjeant"&gt;{{cite news |last=Serjeant |first=Jill |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/us-usa-trump-media/the-fakeys-comedians-turn-tables-on-trumps-fake-news-awards-idUSKBN1F52L1 |title='The Fakeys': Comedians turn tables on Trump's 'fake news' awards |work=[[Reuters]] |date=January 16, 2018|access-date=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  ''[[The Tonight Show Starring Jimmy Fallon]]'' aired a sketch satirizing the Fake News Awards on January 16.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/369297-fallon-parodies-trumps-fake-news-awards |title=Fallon parodies Trump’s ‘Fake News Awards’ |last=Greenwood |first=Max |date=January 17, 2018 |work=TheHill|access-date=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Awards==
The ten stories awarded were from [[CNN]] (four times), ''[[The New York Times]]'' (twice), ''[[The Washington Post]]'', [[ABC News]], ''[[Newsweek]]'' and ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''.&lt;ref name=Riley-Smith&gt;{{cite news |last1=Riley-Smith |first1=Ben |last2=Graham |first2=Chris |title=Fake News Awards: CNN 'wins' taking 4 out of 11 'accolades' announced by Donald Trump |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/2018/01/18/fake-news-awardscnn-wins-taking-4-11-accolades-announced-donald/ |accessdate=January 18, 2018 |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;
An eleventh bonus award was given to reports about [[Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections]] in general, which was called "perhaps the greatest hoax perpetrated on the American people".&lt;ref name="Siddiqui"/&gt;

The initial announcement of the winners was described by media [[Pundit|pundits]] as a flop, because the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]'s website experienced technical difficulties and displayed a 404 error, along with a note that stated "we're [[Make America Great Again|making it great again]]".&lt;ref name="Borchers" /&gt; Eventually, a link to a working blog post was supplied.

The three stories on the online poll previously offered to Trump's supporters were ABC's reporting on Michael Flynn, CNN's reporting on Trump access to WikiLeaks documents, and Zeke Miller's erroneous report on the Martin Luther King Jr. bust.&lt;ref name=Anapol-Fake/&gt;&lt;ref name="Borchers"/&gt;

==Reception==
Reaction to the "awards" was strong from different sources. Trump's supporters have seen the "awards" as a tongue-in-cheek approach to highlighting what they believe is media biased against the president, while critics have viewed them as an attempt to undermine [[freedom of the press]].&lt;ref name=Riley-Smith/&gt;

In response to the Fake News Awards, the [[Committee to Protect Journalists]] announced on January 8, 2018, its "Press Oppressors awards". The group gave Trump the "Overall Achievement in Undermining Global Press Freedom" for inspiring cries of "fake news" in China, Syria, and Russia. Other awards went to [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]], [[Xi Jinping]], and [[Aung San Suu Kyi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Hafner |first=Josh |url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/01/09/trump-takes-top-honors-press-oppressors-awards/1017934001/ |title=Trump takes top 'honors' in Press Oppressors awards |work=USA Today |date=January 9, 2018 |accessdate=August 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "awards" were called an assault on a free press and the [[First Amendment]] by 2016 presidential candidate [[Evan McMullin]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=McMullin|first1=Evan|last2=Finn|first2=Mindy|title=The Fake News Awards are another escalation in Trump's assault on press freedoms|url=http://beta.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-mcmullin-finn-fake-news-awards-20180117-story.html|work=Los Angeles Times|date=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was described similarly by ''The Guardian'', who called it "a bizarre spectacle".&lt;ref name="Siddiqui"/&gt; Trump was also criticized for the awards by Republican Senators [[Jeff Flake]] and [[John McCain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Bredemeier |first1=Ken |title=Two Republican Senators Assail Trump for Media Attacks |url=https://www.voanews.com/a/republican-senators-assail-trump-media-attacks/4211911.html |date=January 18, 2018 |work=VOA |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; McCain, in an [[op-ed]] in ''The Washington Post'', commented that Trump's use of the phrase "fake news" is "being used by autocrats to silence reporters, undermine political opponents, stave off media scrutiny, and mislead citizens".&lt;ref name="Stewart" /&gt; Connecticut governor [[Dannel Malloy]] called the awards "fascist propaganda".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Anapol|first1=Avery|title=Connecticut governor: Trump 'Fake News' awards are 'fascist propaganda'|url=http://thehill.com/homenews/state-watch/369602-connecticut-gov-fake-news-awards-are-fascist-propaganda|work=The Hill|date=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On Twitter, some media commentators congratulated the "winners", and others mocked the awards. The Twitter account for the ''[[New York Daily News]]'' expressed disappointment that it did not win an award. The journalist Chris Riotta joked that he was "honored and humbled" to be included in the awards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Anuradha |first=Gayathri |url=http://www.ibtimes.com/president-trumps-fake-news-awards-leave-non-winners-feeling-robbed-2642579 |title=President Trump's Fake News Awards Leave Non-Winners Feeling 'Robbed' |work=International Business Times |date=January 17, 2018 |accessdate=January 18, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''GCompris''' is a software suite comprising [[educational entertainment]] software for children aged 2 to 10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.expresscomputeronline.com/20031006/indiacomputes02.shtml |title=Why Free Software makes sense in education |publisher=Express Computer |date=2003-10-06 |accessdate=2007-07-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070808160630/http://www.expresscomputeronline.com/20031006/indiacomputes02.shtml |archivedate=2007-08-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; GCompris was originally written in [[C (programming language)|C]] and [[Python (programming language)|Python]] using the [[GTK+]] [[widget toolkit]], but a rewrite in [[C++]] and [[Qt Meta Language|QML]] using the [[Qt (software)|Qt]] widget toolkit is since early 2014 in process. GCompris is [[free and open-source software]] subject to the requirements of the [[GNU General Public License]] version 3 and has been part of the [[GNU project]].&lt;ref name="gnu"&gt;[https://www.gnu.org/education/edu-software-gcompris.html « GCompris - GNU Project - Free Software Foundation »], ''lists.gnu.org'', Sept 20, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

The name GCompris is a [[pun]], in the [[French language]] is pronounced the same as the phrase "I have understood", ''J'ai compris'' {{IPA-fr|ʒekɔ̃ˈpʁi|}}.

It is available for [[Linux]], [[macOS]] and [[Microsoft Windows|Windows]]. Binaries compiled for Microsoft Windows and macOS are distributed with a restricted number of activities; it is possible to access all the activities for a fee.

== Extent ==
At the time of writing GCompris comprised more than 130 games, called "activities". These are bundled into the following groups:
[[File:GCompris V15.02 Main Menu.png|thumb|Screenshot of Main Menu of Gcompris V15.02.]]
* Computer discovery: keyboard, mouse, different mouse gestures
* Numeracy: table memory, enumeration, double entry table, mirror images
* Science: the canal lock, the water cycle, the submarine, electric simulations
* Geography: place the country on the map
* Games: chess, memory, connect 4, oware, sudoku
* Reading: reading practice
* Other: learn to tell time, puzzle of famous paintings, vector drawing, cartoon making

== Development history ==
[[File:Thimothi Giet DSC 9731.jpg|thumb|right|Timothée Giet, Current Maintainer of GCompris]]
The first version of the game was made in 2000 by Bruno Coudoin, a French software engineer. Since the first release it was distributed freely on the Internet and was protected by the [[GNU General Public License]]. The motivation  behind the development was to provide native educational application for Linux. Since then, the software has seen continuous improvements, in terms of graphics and number of activities, thanks to the help of many developers and graphic artists joining the project over the years.

A new version of Gcompris is completely rewritten using Qt Quick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gcompris.net/wiki/Developer's_corner|title=Developer's corner - GCompris|author=|date=|website=gcompris.net|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The current version is developed using Javascript, QML and C++ languages. An android and raspberry pi versions are available for download.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gcompris.net/downloads-en.html|title=Download - GCompris|first=Timothée|last=Giet|date=|website=gcompris.net|accessdate=15 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{distinguish|screen burn-in}}

In [[television]], a '''ghost''' is a replica of the transmitted image, offset in position, that is super-imposed on top of the main image. It is often caused when a TV signal travels by two [[Multipath propagation|different paths]] to a receiving antenna, with a slight difference in timing.&lt;ref&gt;Jorma Hyypia, ''Beating TV Interference'', ''[[Popular Mechanics]]'' , June 1980 page 126&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:TV ghosting interference.jpg|thumb|A simulated example of severe ghosting in an analog TV broadcast.]]

== Analog ghosting ==
[[Image:IdealTVpathnoghost.png|thumb|right|250px|Ideal situation for TV signal propagation: The signal leaves the [[transmitter]] (TX) and travels through one path to the receiver (the TV set, which is labeled RX)]]
[[Image:MultipathTVghost.png|thumb|right|250px|An object (an aircraft) complicates the system by adding a second path. The signal arrives at RX by two paths which have different lengths. The main path is the direct path, while the second is a reflection from the plane.]]
[[File:TV ghost eliminator.agr.jpg|thumb|A "ghost eliminator" sold to consumers in the 1960s and 70s to make ghosting less visible. This unit was a simple resistive [[Attenuator (electronics)|attenuator]].]]
Common causes of ghosts (in the more specific sense) are:
* [[Impedance matching|Mismatched impedance]] along the communication [[channel (communications)|channel]], which causes unwanted [[Reflection (physics)|reflections]]. The technical term for this phenomenon is [[ringing (signal)|ringing]].
* [[Multipath propagation|Multipath]] distortion, because [[radio frequency]] [[wave]]s may take paths of different length (by reflecting from buildings, transmission lines, aircraft, clouds, etc.) to reach the [[receiver (radio)|receiver]]. In addition, RF leaks may allow a signal to enter the set by a different path; this is most common in a large building such as a tower block or [[hotel]] where one TV antenna feeds many different rooms, each fitted with a TV aerial socket (known as pre-echo). By getting a better antenna or cable system it can be eliminated or mitigated.

Note that ghosts are a problem specific to the [[video]] portion of television, largely because it uses [[Amplitude modulation|AM]] for transmission.  [[SECAM]] TV uses [[Frequency modulation|FM]] for the [[chrominance]] signal, hence ghosting only affects the [[luma (video)]] portion of its signal. TV is broadcast on [[VHF]] and [[UHF]], which have [[line-of-sight propagation]], and easily reflect off of buildings, mountains, and other objects.

The [[sound reproduction|audio]] portion uses [[Frequency modulation|FM]], which has the desirable property that a stronger [[Signalling (telecommunication)|signal]] tends to overpower interference from weaker signals due to the [[capture effect]].  Even when ghosts are particularly bad in the picture, there may be little audio interference.

===Pre-echo===

If the ghost is seen on the left of the main picture, then it is likely that the problem is pre-echo, which is seen in buildings with very long TV downleads where an RF leakage has allowed the TV signal to enter the tuner by a second route. For instance, plugging in an additional aerial to a TV which already has a communal TV aerial connection (or [[cable TV]]) can cause this condition.

==Digital ghosting==
Ghosting is not specific to [[analog television|analog]] transmission. It may appear in [[digital television]] when interlaced video is incorrectly [[deinterlacing|deinterlaced]] for display on progressive-scan output devices. The mechanisms that cause ghosting in analog television may corrupt the signal beyond use for [[digital television]]. 8VSB, [[COFDM]], and other modulation schemes seek to correct this.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="57170">The '''history of Canadian sports''' falls into five stages of development: early recreational activities before 1840; the start of organized competition, 1840-1880; the emergence of national organizations, 1882-1914; the rapid growth of both amateur and professional sports, 1914 to 1960; and developments of the last half-century.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara Schrodt, "Problems of Periodization in Canadian Sport History," ''Canadian Journal of History of Sport'' (1990) 21#1 pp 65-76.&lt;/ref&gt;  Some sports, especially hockey, lacrosse and curling enjoy an international reputation as particularly Canadian.&lt;ref&gt;Heather Mair, "[http://id.erudit.org/revue/ijcs/2007/v/n35/040763ar.html?lang=en Curling in Canada: From Gathering Place to International Spectacle]," ''International Journal of Canadian Studies'' (2007), Issue 35, pp 39-60&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadian sports attract large numbers of participants and huge audiences; hockey, played by 1.4 million Canadians, has become part of the national identity. Team sports often involved informal gambling. More formal bigger-stakes wagering and prize competitions were characteristic  especially of horse racing and boxing. In the 21st century the major team sports are hockey, baseball, softball, football, and basketball. Women, once shunted aside, are now actively competing in most of these sports; the nation celebrated the medal performance  of its Olympic athletes. As in  many modern nations the challenges faced by sports in recent decades include violence, racism, illegal drug therapies, ridicule of women, the increasingly disproportionate salaries of professional athletes, and the soaring cost of the newest model stadiums. Such problems stand in contrast to the fundamental values of sports including personal health, teamwork, striving for responsibility, loyalty, equality, winning, pleasure, and freedom.

Individual sports have long been important, including skating, skiing, golf, paddling, swimming, and track and field; in recent years there has been a surge of interest in more "extreme" sports such as snowboarding, rollerblading and mountain climbing.

==Origins==
Immigrants brought along their favourite sports, often adapting them to the snowy environment.  The influence of the games of the First Nations can be seen especially in the evolution of lacrosse.  British officers, soldiers, and royal officials, and indeed ordinary British immigrants as well, transplanted such games as football, rugby, curling, and cricket; sailors brought rowing competitions. Britons considered these sports to be conducive to relieving boredom on remote outposts, and more generally produced team spirit, good health, hardiness, and manliness; they were a sophisticated alternative to "blood sports", such as cockfighting, bullfighting or bear baiting.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow and Kevin B. Wamsley, ''Sport in Canada: A History'' (2005) ch 2&lt;/ref&gt;

===First Nations===
Paraschak, identifies two approaches to the history of Native American sports. On the one hand, there is the history of First Nation athletes playing within the Euro-American mainstream culture. Important topics include the issues of racism, exploitation, and ethnocentric distortion. Secondly there is the history of the sports played among the natives, especially the history of lacrosse as well as other games.&lt;ref&gt;Victoria Paraschak, "Native Sport History: Pitfalls and Promise," ''Canadian Journal of History of Sport'' (1989) 20#1 pp 57-68&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Charles Ballem, "Missing From The Canadian Sport Scene: Native Athletes." ''Canadian Journal of History of Sport'' (1983) 14#2 pp 33-39.&lt;/ref&gt;  The different tribes played (and wagered bets on) toboggan, snowshoe, and canoe races as well as archery, wrestling, spear throwing and running events. They provided entertainment for the community and a way to sharpen essential survival skills, including the ability to endure pain and hardship.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow and Wamsley (2005) p 11&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Edward Norbeck Claire R. Farrer, eds., ''Forms of Play of Native North Americans'' (West Publishing Company: 1979)&lt;/ref&gt;

===First organized sports===
The roots of organized sports in Canada date back to the 1770s, often originating in horse racing at British military garrisons, curling in Scottish settlements, and lacrosse among the Indians. Perhaps the first athletic celebrities were the Canadian scullers who won several international championships.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Roxborough, "The Beginning of Organized Sport in Canada," ''Canada'' (1975) 2#3 pp 30-43&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Morrow and Wamsley, ''Sport in Canada: A History'' (2005) ch 3&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cultural influences of sports===
French Canadians by 1700 were influenced by native culture to the degree that they began to measure themselves and their masculinity against their native counterparts by competing against them in such activities as canoeing, snowshoeing, and tobogganing and in the team sport of lacrosse. In building on this mix of  French and native traditions, the French  Canadiens expressed not only their masculinity and identity through sports, but also built a sense of  national identity  that contrasted sharply  with the Anglo spirit of sports for bourgeois gentlemen during the Victorian era.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Robidoux, "Historical Interpretations of First Nations Masculinity and its Influence on Canada's Sport Heritage." ''International Journal of the History of Sport'' (2006) 23#2 pp 267-284&lt;/ref&gt;

Much of Canadian historiography on sports education deals with the linkage  between sports education and the construction of a national identity.  Hudon (2005) examines the history of sports education from 1870 to 1940 in Quebec's classic schools for boys from ages 11 to 18. He finds an impact of  religious pedagogy on sports education, arguing that it promoted a Catholic spirituality with masculine undertones.&lt;ref&gt;Christine Hudon, "'Le Muscle et Le Vouloir': Les Sports dans les Colleges Classiques masculins au Quebec, 1870-1940," ["Muscle and Will": Sports in Boys' Colléges Classiques in Quebec, 1870-1940] ''Historical Studies in Education'' (2005) 17#2 pp 243-263&lt;/ref&gt;

In Anglophone Canada  a strong influence came from the ideals of English author and reformer [[Thomas Hughes]],   especially as exemplified in ''Tom Brown's Schooldays'' (1857). Hughes's notions that sportsmanship exemplified moral education and  provided training for citizenship, have  had a powerful influence on the Canadian sport community. Despite  commercialism and the celebration of high-performance athletes, the Hughesian principles of Christian socialism continues to  influence  sports programs for youth. Outside of sports the social and moral agendas behind muscular Christianity influenced numerous reform movements, thus linking it to the political left in Canada, contrary to its right-wing reputation in other parts of the world.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Kidd, "Muscular Christianity and Value-centred Sport: the Legacy of Tom Brown in Canada." ''International Journal of the History of Sport'' (2006) 23#5 pp 701-713&lt;/ref&gt;

Canadians in the 19th century came to believe themselves possessed of a unique "northern character," due to the long, harsh winters that only those of hardy body and mind could survive. This hardiness was claimed as a Canadian trait, and such sports as ice hockey and snowshoeing that reflected this were asserted as characteristically Canadian.&lt;ref&gt;? Dave Brown, "The Northern Character Theme and Sport in Nineteenth Century Canada," ''Canadian Journal of History of Sport'' (1989) 20#1 pp 47-56&lt;/ref&gt;   Outside the arena Canadians express the national characteristics of being peaceful, orderly and polite. Inside they scream their lungs out at ice hockey games, cheering the speed, ferocity, and violence, making hockey an ambiguous symbol of Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Robidoux, "Imagining a Canadian Identity through Sport: A Historical Interpretation of Lacrosse and Hockey," ''The Journal of American Folklore'' (2002) 115#456, pp.209-225&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sports fans==
The advantage of the larger cities was the potential availability of a large paying crowd; the problem was providing cheap transportation for people not living close by. The solution was to use steamers, and later railways and trams to run special schedules to bring fans to an outlying event. As early as the 1830s steamers were making special trips to horseracing events to horse races. By the 1860s there were special trains or steamers to take fans to rowing contests, track and field events, bicycle races, and other contests.&lt;ref&gt;Morrow and Wamsley, ''Sport in Canada: A History'' (2005) pp 44-47&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Trevor Williams, "Cheap Rates, Special Trains and Canadian Sport in the 1850's," ''Canadian Journal of History of Sport'' (1981) 12#2 pp 84-93.&lt;/ref&gt;

Baseball emerged in the 1870s, as a nonviolent, rules-oriented game that appealed to middle-class reformers seeking antidotes to crime, rowdiness and social disorder. However, when professional baseball emerged in the 1880s, unruly behavior by players and fans contradicted the reformers ideal of a gentleman's game played before a well-behaved audience. Gambling became a major feature, as did the rise of working-class players and rowdy working-class fans. The only solution the reformers found was to separate gentleman elite amateur baseball from the professional version that was getting out of control.&lt;ref&gt;Colin D. Howell, "Baseball, Class and Community in the Maritime Provinces, 1870-1910," ''Social History / Histoire Sociale'' (1989) 22#4 pp 265-286&lt;/ref&gt;

Although many small cities and towns had their own local teams, the residents paid special attention to the celebrity players on the great big-city teams. Advancing technology of the telegraph, the radio, and television allowed real time reporting of major games, often to public gatherings or restaurants or bars. Further details were sure to appear the next newspaper, keeping up local interest, and wagering, on a daily basis. Vicarious participation as the fan of a particular team enhanced a sense of belonging to the Canadian nation and its rapidly developing popular culture.&lt;ref&gt;Stacy L. Lorenz, "A Lively Interest on the Prairies": Western Canada, the Mass Media, and a 'World of Sport,' 1870-1939," ''Journal of Sport History'' (2000) 27#2 pp 195-227&lt;/ref&gt;

===Funding===
In recent decades professional sports has involved large scale funding for stadiums. The intense interest shown by the fan base in their community's teams encourages the political leadership to invest heavily in public subsidies for new arenas. There is a "honeymoon" effect producing a surge in attendance in the first few years of the new arena. In the 1972-2003 era, the honeymoon effect for major new arenas in hockey, baseball, and basketball is an increase in attendance of 15-20% in the first few years. The honeymoon ends after 5 to 8 years.&lt;ref&gt;John C. Leadley and Zenon X. Zygmont, "When Is the Honeymoon Over? National Hockey League Attendance, 1970-2003," ''Canadian Public Policy'' (2006) 32#2 pp 213-232&lt;/ref&gt;

===Media===
As the popular daily press emerged in all Canadian cities in the late 19th century, they broadened their audience appeal by detailed coverage of local provincial and national sporting events.  Readers developed a sense of community pride, while also involving fans in the national and international "world of sport."  The telegraph provided near-real-time coverage of events.  Despite the vast distances separating them from other Canadians, local fans discovered that they were part of a common national audience as they followed the successes and disappointments of Canadian and American hockey and baseball teams, as well as such sports as rowing and boxing.&lt;ref&gt;Stacy L. Lorenz, "'In the Field of Sport at Home and Abroad': Sports Coverage in Canadian Daily Newspapers, 1850-1914." ''Sport History Review'' 2003 34(2): 133-167. {{ISSN|1087-1659}}; Lorenz, "'A Lively Interest on the Prairies': Western Canada, the Mass Media, and a 'World of Sport,' 1870-1939." ''Journal of Sport History'' 2000 27(2): 195-227. {{ISSN|0094-1700}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Organizational infrastructure==
In the early 20th century the major sports set up volunteer national organizations to take jurisdiction; by 1914 there were 20 governing bodies. By 1919 the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada (AAU) presided over all leadership and provided international recognition. The AAU promoted  participation in the Olympics.  All the governing bodies saw sport as a suitable training ground or productive citizenship, allegiance to the social order, and English Canadian nationalism. They fought againstprofessionalism through a "Canadian Parliament of Sport".  However, in the 1930s the amateur leaders split bitterly over the issue of a liberalized amateur code, as ice hockey, basketball and lacrosse walked out of the AAU. By 1939, the jurisdiction of the AAU was reduced to track and field and the other individual Olympic sports. The Canadian Olympic Association broke away in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Bruce Kidd|title=The Struggle for Canadian Sport|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=l_jJJspDo7UC&amp;pg=PA21|year=1996|publisher=U. of Toronto Press|pages=21–28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1909 until 1967, the Canadian Track and Field Association (C.T.F.A.) controlled track and field sports. It operated under the umbrella of the A.A.U. of C. (Amateur Athletic Union of Canada). In 1968, the C.T.F.A broke loose from the A.A.U. of C. The A.A.U. of C. dissolved in the early 1970s as all national the federations in the different sports went their own ways. In 1991 the C.T.F.A. changed its name to [[Athletics Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Mick Green|author2=Barri Houlihan|title=Elite Sport Development: Policy Learning And Political Priorities|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xwQjLb2ix1wC&amp;pg=PA106|year=2005|publisher=Psychology Press|page=106}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Informal stick-and-ball games on ice had been played for years, especially in the Maritime provinces and at military garrisons. In its modern form hockey was standardized by students at McGill University in 1875. The game rapidly spread nationwide; recognition came in 1893 when Lord Stanley, Canada's governor general, established the Stanley Cup. Ice hockey was distinctly Canadian; it was a winter sport with vague rules, played on conveniently available outside ice. There were few spectators.  Professional teams appeared around 1900; in 1904, five cities in the United States and Ontario formed the International Hockey League (IHL). The American-based league paid salaries that attracted many Canadian stars. Canadian amateur teams were forced to secretly pay their players, even as they proclaimed the principles of amateurism. The IHL collapsed in 1907. in 1908 came the first Canadian-based professional league, the Ontario Professional Hockey League. The [[Timiskaming Professional Hockey League|Timiskaming League]], fuelled by gambling and mining profits, started paying players and raiding amateur and professional senior teams for players

Canadians explored polar extremes of masculinity by a watching the Ottawa Silver Seven battle the  Montreal Wanderers  in 1907. Reporters depicted the game as a combination of "strenuous spectacle" and "brutal butchery." Middle-class ideals of gentlemanly masculinity and genteel sportsmanship stood opposed to a rough, working-class expression of violent masculinity. They both coexisted within the fast, skilled, rugged, hard-hitting hockey, thereby appealing to the largest possible audience.&lt;ref&gt;Stacy L. Lorenz, and Geraint B. Osborne, "'Talk about Strenuous Hockey': Violence, Manhood, and the 1907 Ottawa Silver Seven-Montreal Wanderer Rivalry." ''Journal of Canadian Studies'' (2006) 40#1 pp 125-156&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1910, the world of ice hockey had split into two worlds, the amateurs of the junior, intermediates and the seniors playing for the new [[Allan Cup]], while the professionals took over as the elite leagues, playing for the [[Stanley Cup]]. From a combination of the money of the mining of Timiskaming and the industry of Montreal, the [[National Hockey Association]] (NHA) was formed. Unlike previous leagues, which were derived from amateur hockey associations, the NHA organized itself as a business, organizing each team as a franchise of the business and first used standard player's contracts and a salary cap. Professional ice hockey came to the west coast with the arrival of the Patrick family, organizing the [[Pacific Coast Hockey Association]] (PCHA). Organized as a single business, it developed as an alternative elite league and furthered the development of ice hockey in western Canada. Professional ice hockey was established from coast to coast by this time. Although the PCHA eventually failed, other professional leagues were organized to take its place.

In 1917, the NHA became the [[National Hockey League]] (NHL). After a few weak years, the NHL grew with expansion into the United States. By 1940 it had strong bases in Montreal, Toronto, Boston, New York, Chicago, and Detroit—the "original six".  After 1926 it became a cartel that controlled all aspects of professional hockey. Other  professional leagues one by one collapsed. The NHL exerted its control by expansion into the U.S., the establishment of a minor league system.

At the same time, amateur hockey continued, and was still competitive with professional ice hockey. The [[Winnipeg Falcons]], composed of Icelandic Canadians, was excluded from Winnipeg's senior hockey league for the 1919-20 season. Nevertheless, the team became Canadian national champions and won the 1920 Olympic gold medal in Antwerp.  Combined with their willingness to volunteer for military service in the Great War, its success made the team a symbol of Canadian manhood, transcending the ethnic stereotyping and discrimination that affected some other sports teams during postwar era.&lt;ref&gt;Ryan Eyford, "From Prairie Goolies to Canadian Cyclones: the Transformation of the 1920 Winnipeg Falcons." ''Sport History Review'' (2006) 37#1 pp 5-18.&lt;/ref&gt;

With fans having less discretionary spending during the [[Great Depression]], the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association faced financial uncertainty. Its response was to reevaluate its purist position on amateurism and to rethink its relation to the system of amateur sports, which was headed by the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada. The weak performance of the Canadian hockey team at the 1936 Olympics led to substantial changes in policies and procedures.&lt;ref&gt;John Wong, "Sport Networks on Ice: the Canadian Experience at the 1936 Olympic Hockey Tournament." ''Sport History Review'' 2003 34(2): 190-212.&lt;/ref&gt;

The NHL formed an affiliation with the major governing body in Canadian amateur hockey, the Canadian Amateur Hockey Association (CAHA).  The alliances made with the minor leagues and the CAHA, in particular, gave the NHL's market control over players such as  the waivers, reserve clause, draft, and territorial right much broader impact.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel S. Mason, "The International Hockey League and the Professionalization of Ice Hockey, 1904-1907."  ''Journal of Sport History'' (1998) 25#1 pp 1-17.&lt;/ref&gt;  Although the NHL only had six teams, they had control of the best players. Players could be signed for life to an NHL team's organization at the age of twelve.

The original six era cemented the NHL as the biggest draw in Canada, fuelled partly by the rivalry of the [[Montreal Canadiens]] and the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]]. The Canadiens' [[Maurice Richard|Maurice "Rocket" Richard]] (1921–2000) became one of Canada's iconic heroes, especially in Quebec. Playing from 1942–60, he scored 544 regular season goals and 82 more in playoffs. Famed for his dashing style of play, his intensity, determination, and scoring prowess, Richard became the first 50-goal scorer in NHL history in 1944-45, with a 50-game schedule. He was named to the All Star team 14 times, won two Hart trophies as league MVP, and led the Canadiens to eight Stanley Cups.&lt;ref&gt;Benoit  Melancon, ''The Rocket: A Cultural History'' (Vancouver: Greystone Books, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;

After World War II, the amateur system declined in the face of competition from professional ice hockey, both in the growth of minor leagues, and the introduction of televised matches by the NHL. Several amateur leagues, such as the Quebec Senior League, became first mixed then fully professional. While senior play for the Allan Cup continued, fewer and fewer senior players were available. Further growth in hockey leagues in the United States led to further demand for players. By this time, several of the minor leagues had many players who could have played in the NHL, had there been more teams. By the 1960s, there was interest in setting up another professional league in the United States. In response, the NHL expanded to 12 teams, the new positions mostly filled by players from the minors. The control of junior players by the NHL went away at this time. The signing of contracts to under-age players, binding them to a single team was replaced by a draft of the available players by the NHL teams. The junior leagues became the pre-eminent Canadian leagues, discarding the control of the regional associations to set up "major junior" leagues. Senior amateur play dwindled further with the increase in professional positions.

By the 1960s, Canada had difficulty forming amateur senior teams to compete internationally. University players and a dedicated amateur national team were no match for the organized amateurism of teams from Europe, especially the [[Soviet Union]]. Finally, the Canadian ice hockey federation broke off from amateur play at the Olympics and world championships. The Canadians demanded that the organizations allow professionals, those considered Canada's best.

In September 1972, Canada's best hockey players from the National Hockey League (NHL) played the elite amateurs from the [[Soviet Union]] in a friendly series. Canadian prime minister Pierre Trudeau and his Soviet counterpart, [[Alexei Kosygin]] in 1971 proposed increasing the hockey competitions between the two northern nations. National hockey officials Planned series of eight games, four to be played across Canada and four in Moscow. Canadians saw the [[Summit Series]] as an affirmation of their global supremacy in hockey. However, the Soviets planned an upset that would impress the world and let them claim the Canadian game as their own. The publicity was enormous. The media portrayed a global contests pitting East against West - communism against capitalism - and many of the players were swept away with the sense of history in the making.  The Summit series became a politically charged event with widespread cultural repercussions - quite literally, a Cold War. The Canadians fell 2  games behind but swept the final three games in Moscow to win the series four games to three, with one tie.&lt;ref&gt;J. J. Wilson, "27 Remarkable Days: the 1972 Summit Series of Ice Hockey Between Canada and the Soviet Union." ''Totalitarian Movements and Political Religions'' (2004) 5#2 pp 271-280&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Markku Jokisipilä, "Maple Leaf, Hammer, and Sickle: International Ice Hockey During the Cold War." ''Sport History Review'' (2006) 37#1 pp 36-53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Summit Series awoke an interest in developing the sport of ice hockey further in Canada. Before 1919, few safety rules existed in amateur hockey. By 1945, however, there were rules against boarding and hits from behind, and fighting was penalized more severely. By 1972, the professionals still did not wear helmets, required in amateur play. Fighting was still allowed in amateur and professional play in Canada. There was also an interest in further developing the quality of instruction. Canada returned to international play with the IIHF and the Olympics allowing professionals.

At the same time, the number of professional teams was expanding with the formation of the [[World Hockey Association]]. New professional teams were formed in Edmonton, Winnipeg, Quebec and Ottawa. Several of the teams made it into the expanded NHL in 1979, which now had professional teams from Vancouver all the way east to Quebec City. The 1980s saw a period of consolidation, and the introduction of European players into the professional teams of the NHL, made necessary by the expansion of the NHL. In the 1990s, the Canadian dollar declined, and while Canada gained an NHL team in Ottawa, teams from Quebec City and Winnipeg move to the United States.

Women's hockey continued to develop in popularity in the 1980s. The first women's world championship was held in 1990. Women's ice hockey became a medal sport in the Olympics of 1998. Women players developed to the point where professional leagues were organized and women players started playing in men's professional leagues.
 
The [[Memorial Cup]], a tournament originated in 1920 for junior-level teams began to grow in popularity. The junior leagues also grew in popularity and expanded into United States near to the border. The junior leagues, like the professionals, started to allow non-Canadian players, partly in response to the American teams, and partly in response to the growing popularity and competition within its ranks to make it to the Memorial Cup tournament. The growth of cable television meant more junior-level games were televised.

By 2000, the NHL had grown to 30 teams and has not expanded since. The junior leagues had consolidated into three; in Quebec and the Maritimes, Ontario and Western Canada. The further introduction of European players became a concern and was limited. In 2002, Canada won its first men's ice hockey title in 50 years, at the Olympics in [[Salt Lake City]], using NHL players. The Canadian team won another title in 2010, at the Olympics held in Vancouver, where the Olympics used Canadian standard-sized rinks.

==Football, rugby and soccer==
The game of Soccer goes back centuries in England, where around 1823 was transformed into rugby.  The first game in Canada came in the 1860s with British officers playing university students in Montreal. Universities quickly adopted the new sport, as did rowing clubs that found it useful in the off-season. The Americans were developing a similar game, so in 1874 McGill played two games with Harvard, alternating the rules. The series was played out for several years, but Canada increasingly adopted the American rules and so the two versions of football were very similar. In 1898 the Canadian rules were formalized; they differed from the American rules chiefly in the size of the field and in three- rather than four-down play.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Zweig, "Playing Football the Canadian Way: When McGill Met Harvard in 1874 an Old Game Took a New Direction," ''Beaver'' (1995) 75#55 pp 24-29.&lt;/ref&gt;

Governor General Earl Grey donated a championship trophy in 1907 to the best amateur team; the [[Grey Cup]] went to the professional champions in 1954. Major innovations, such as the forward pass, came in the 1920s and 1930s as American athletes and coaches arrived. In 1936, fearful of the drift towards Americanization, the Canadian Rugby Union placed a limit on the number of foreigners; import quotas remain in effect in the 21st century. After 1945 football flourished at the intercollegiate and professional levels. The [[Canadian Football League]] (CFL) distributed franchises across the country, and crowds flocked to the games. The Grey Cup championship game, first telecast in 1952, attracts one of the largest TV audiences, over 4&amp;nbsp;million. The CFL added five American teams in 1993; this proved a costly blunder, as four teams folded and the fifth moved to Montreal. After surviving the closing of the Ottawa Rough Riders in 1996 and bankruptcies by the Toronto and Hamilton teams in 2003, football has recovered and is in fair health in the 21st century.&lt;ref&gt;Charles A. Kupfer, "Crabs in the Grey Cup: Baltimore's Canadian Football Sojourn, 1994-95," ''International Journal of the History of Sport'' (2007) 24#1 pp 49-6&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Nauright, and Phil White, "Mediated Nostalgia, Community and Nation: the Canadian Football League in Crisis and the Demise of the Ottawa Rough Riders, 1986-1996," ''Sport History Review'' (2002) 33#2 pp: 121-137.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Soccer in Canada]] has grown in popularity in recent decades, especially as a school sport for boys and girls. It has more players than ice hockey. At the professional level, the [[Toronto FC]] in 2007 became the first Canadian club in the American [[Major League Soccer]] (MLS). In 2009, another MLS franchise was awarded to [[Vancouver Whitecaps FC|Vancouver]], and began play in the 2011 season.  In 2010, an MLS franchise was awarded to [[Montreal Impact|Montreal]] for the [[2012 Major League Soccer season|2012 season]]. Both the Vancouver and Montreal clubs had their roots in lower-tier professional soccer leagues.

==Other sports==

===Lacrosse===
{{See also|Lacrosse}}

Lacrosse was invented in the 1850s, when the Anglophone middle class of Montreal adopted the Indian game of "baggataway", which was a violent game played by the First Nation teams numbering hundreds of players.&lt;ref&gt;T. George Vellathottam, Kevin G. Jones, "Highlights in the Development of Canadian Lacrosse to 1931," ''Canadian Journal of History of Sport &amp; Physical Education'' (1974) 5#2 pp 31-47&lt;/ref&gt;  The 1860s saw the first powerhouse team, the Montreal Shamrocks; it was Irish, Catholic, and aggressive. During the 1870s and 1880s the Shamrocks had bloody confrontations with the upscale Protestant Montreal and Toronto Lacrosse Clubs.  Field lacrosse spread across the country with the tide of Anglophone settlers from Ontario and Quebec. By the early 1890s it was the most popular summer game in Canada. The golden age came in the 1900s, as two professional leagues operated. Escalating violence led to the collapse of the professional leagues in 1914, and the game's base of support shrank to Montreal, Victoria, Vancouver, New Westminster, and small-towns in Ontario. The organizational infrastructure proved too weak—for example, it was never adopted by schools or churches.&lt;ref&gt;Michael A. Robidoux, "Imagining a Canadian Identity through Sport: A Historical Interpretation of Lacrosse and Hockey," ''The Journal of American Folklore'' (2002) 115#456  pp.209-225 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4129220 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1931, promoters introduced "box lacrosse" to broaden the fan base to include a summer audience. Played in a smaller space, box lacrosse could be held indoors or in baseball stadiums. The game was especially violent. The poverty of the Great Depression reduced the number of fans who could afford to attend and cities that could find sponsors. The promoters, while failing to make a profit, changed the landscape of Canadian amateur lacrosse, isolating it from the more widely contested field lacrosse played in the United States, Britain, and Australia. In 1987 the National Lacrosse League began; it opened clubs in twelve cities in the United States and Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Donald M. Fisher, "'Splendid but Undesirable Isolation': Recasting Canada's National Game as Box Lacrosse, 1931-1932" ''Sport History Review'' (2005) 36#2 pp 115-129&lt;/ref&gt;

Field lacrosse was revived in the late 1990s when some Ontario universities included it in their women's athletic programs; university women now play the game once associated with Canadian masculinity.

===Basketball===
{{Main article|Basketball in Canada}}
{{Main article|History of basketball}}
[[James Naismith]], a Canadian who emigrated to the U.S., invented basketball in Springfield, Massachusetts in the 1890s. It rapidly became popular as an indoor winter sport that needed a minimum of equipment, gaining popularity at upscale high schools and colleges in both the U.S. and Canada.  In 1946, early in the era of professional basketball, the owners of the Toronto Maple Leaf hockey team started a franchise in the newly formed Basketball Association of America. Seven thousand spectators watched the first game of the Toronto Huskies, but they lost and attendance fell off as newsmen called it a freak show. The Huskies ended in last place, and folded. It had suffered inconsistent management decisions and the temper tantrums of its coach. The Huskies could not compete with Toronto's successful teams and sporting heroes in hockey, baseball, football, rugby, and wrestling.&lt;ref&gt;Shane Peacock, "The Toronto Huskies: Pro Basketball's False Start." ''Beaver'' 1996 76(5): 33-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Boxing===
{{main article|Boxing in Canada}}
The sport of boxing, both amateur and professional, has been practised in Canada since before Confederation. Professional boxing was illegal in Canada during the London Prize Ring era but fights still took place outside major towns in barns and farmers' fields. The first universally recognized world boxing champion from Canada was [[George Dixon (boxer)|George Dixon]] a black man from Halifax, Nova Scotia. Despite its relatively small population this country has produced many world class pugilists in both the pro and amateur ranks.&lt;ref&gt;Murray Greig, "Goin' the Distance" ''MacMillan'' 1996, Pp 56-61.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Curling===
{{main article|Curling}}
Curling, a sport that earned Olympic status in 1998, arrived with Scottish soldiers in the 1750s. the Royal Caledonian Curling Club in Scotland standardized the rules in the 1830s.  It involves sliding a 42-pound teapot-shaped granite curling stone by its handle toward a goal painted on the ice, with players using brooms to alter its course.   The sweeping removes debris, and warms the surface, creating a hydroplane-like effect. By 1903 Winnipeg had become the world's curling capital of an intensely competitive winter sport played throughout Canada.&lt;ref&gt;

===Cricket===
Cricket never caught on, despite efforts by an imperial-minded elite to promote the game as a way of identifying with the British Empire.  Linked to upper class Canadian elites, the game never became popular with the general public. It had to compete with baseball, and was handicapped by the short summer season. During the First World War, Canadian units stationed in Britain played baseball, not cricket.&lt;ref&gt;David Cooper, "Canadians Declare 'It Isn't Cricket': a Century of Rejection of the Imperial Game, 1860-1960."

Baseball and the Canadian Forces During the First World War," ''Canadian Military History'' (2001) 10#2 pp 27-40&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ultimate and disc sports (Frisbee)===
{{Main article|Ken Westerfield|Ultimate Canada}}
In Canada, organized [[Flying disc games|disc sports]] began in the early 1970s, with promotional efforts from [[Irwin Toy]] (Frisbee distributor for Canada), the [[Ken Westerfield#The Canadian Open and the first Frisbee freestyle competition|Canadian Open Frisbee Championships]], Toronto (1972–1985), the Vancouver Open [[Frisbee]] Championships (1974-1976). [[Flying disc freestyle|Freestyle]], [[double disc court]], [[Guts (game)|disc guts]], [[Ultimate (sport)|ultimate]] and [[disc golf]], became [[Flying disc games|disc sports]] first events. The first [[Canadian Ultimate Championships]] (CUC) were held, for the open division, in Ottawa 1987, produced by Marcus Brady and Brian Guthrie. [[Ottawa-Carleton Ultimate Association|OCUA]] subsequently hosted the 1993, 1999, 2002 and 2011 Canadian Ultimate Championships.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ocua hall of fame|url=http://www.ocua.ca/ultimate-2008-hall-of-fame|accessdate=November 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Lindsay Pattison, "'The Dynamics of the Disc': Ultimate (Frisbee), Community, &amp; Memory, 1968-2011" Diss.

==Women==
{{see also|Canadian women's ice hockey history}}
Sports are high priority in Canadian culture, but women were long relegated to second-class status by men. There were regional differences as well, with the eastern provinces emphasizing a more feminine "girls rule" game of basketball, while the Western provinces preferred identical rules.  Girls’ and women’s sport has traditionally been slowed down by a series of factors: girls and women historically have low levels of interest and participation; there were very few women in leadership positions in academic administration, student affairs or athletics; there were few women coaches; the media strongly emphasized men's sports as a demonstration of masculinity, suggesting that women seriously interested in sports were crossing gender lines; the male sports establishment was actively hostile. Staunch feminists dismissed sports as unworthy of their support. Women's progress was uphill; they first had to counter the widespread notion that women's bodies were so restricted and delicate that vigorous physical activity was dangerous. These notions where first challenged by the "new woman" around 1900. These women started with bicycling; they rode into new gender spaces in education, work, and suffrage.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ann Hall, ''The Girl and the Game: A History of Women's Sport in Canada'' (Broadview Press, 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1920s marked a breakthrough for women, including working-class young women in addition to the pioneering middle class sportswomen. The Women's Amateur Federation of Canada (WAAF) was formed in 1926 to make possible new opportunities, particularly in international competition. The WAAF worked to rebut the stereotype that vigorous physical activity and intense competition was "unwomanly". One tactic was to set up a system of medical supervision for all women athletes. The WAAF forged an alliance with supportive men who dominated the Amateur Athletic Union of Canada; this allowed women to compete in the Olympics and the British Empire Games.

Many barriers fell in the 1920s: the Edmonton Grads became the world champions of women's basketball; the first Canadian women participated in the Olympics; and women sportswriters such as Phyllis Griffiths were hired to cover their feats on the sports pages.

The 1930s brought setbacks, as critics recommended  non-competitive athletic  activities as the recreation most suited to women. During the 1930s, a team of women from the small town of Preston, Ontario, overcame the difficulty of obtaining adequate ice time for practice, and the challenge of raising adequate funds from their small fan base. The Rivulettes  dominated women's ice hockey, winning ten provincial championships and four of the six Dominion championships.&lt;ref&gt;Carly Adams, "Queens of the Ice Lanes": The Preston Rivulettes and Women's Hockey in Canada, 1931-1940," ''Sport History Review'' (2008) 39#1 pp 1-29&lt;/ref&gt;  With money short during the Great Depression; after 1939 the hyper-masculinity of the Second World War blocked women's opportunities.  Women's hockey largely disappeared during the Second World War. After the war, the back-to-the-family conservatism Women's sports in the shadows. The feminists of the 1970s rarely helped promote women's breakthroughs in sports. Nevertheless, more and more women engaged in aerobics and organized sport. Figure skater [[Barbara Ann Scott]] was the outstanding female athlete of the 1940s, as the 1948 Olympic champion, a two-time World champion (1947–1948), and a four-time Canadian national champion (1944–46, 48) in ladies' singles.  She was very heavily covered by the media. However, it focused less on her sportsmanship and athletic achievements and more on her beauty and her "sweetheart" image.&lt;ref&gt;Don Morrow, "Sweetheart Sport: Barbara Ann Scott and the Post World War II Image of the Female Athlete in Canada," ''Canadian Journal of History of Sport'' (1987) 18#1 pp 36-54&lt;/ref&gt;

Change for women in sport began slowly, but then accelerated after 1980. The Fitness and Amateur Sport Act of 1961 (Bill C-131) and the report of the Royal Commission on the Status of Women in 1970 marked major advances. Perhaps the most critical development came in 1974, when Marion Lay and the federal government’s Fitness and Amateur Sport Branch (FASB) sponsored a National Conference on Women and Sport.  it brought together coaches, academic administrators, and athletes to talk over the issues raised by the Royal Commission, and to chart a way forward.  Even so, there was no way to monitor the process and implement the recommendations. The 1980s accelerated the movement forward. The Sport Canada’s Women’s Program in 1980; the Female Athlete Conference in 1981; the Women in Sport program in 1981; and the Constitution Act of 1982. In 1981 Abby Hoffman, a former Olympian, was named director general of Sport Canada. Its  "Policy on Women's Sport" called for equality. The AAU of Canada now became more supportive. Court cases nail down the women's right to participate. In the provinces, human rights commissions addressed dozens of sport-related equity cases for women. Gender barriers in sports became a political topic, as shown by the Minister’s Task Force Report in 1992 and the landmark decision of the Canadian Sport Council to include gender equity quotas in their operating principles.  By the 1990s women proved eager to enter formerly all-male sports such as ice hockey, rugby, and wrestling.  Their activism and their prowess on the playing field eroded old stereotypes and opened up new social roles for the woman athlete on campus and in her community. New problems emerged for sportswomen trying to achieve equal status with sportsmen: raising money, attracting popular audiences, and winning sponsors.&lt;ref&gt;M. Ann Hall, ''The Girl and the Game: A History of Women's Sport in Canada.'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt;

Harrigan, (2003) reviews the emergence of women's athletics in higher education during 1961-2001. The establishment of the National Fitness and Amateur Sport Advisory Council helped women's intercollegiate sports to gain momentum. simultaneously there was a rise in the proportion of women in the student bodies, which enhanced the visibility of their sports. To overcome institutional inertia, women concentrated on organizing their sports and raising the consciousness of both male and female students. In 1969, the Canadian Women's Intercollegiate Athletic Union was formed to oversee events and sanction national championships; it merged with the Canadian Intercollegiate Athletic Union in 1978. Women increasingly became more active after 1980.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick J. Harrigan, "Women's Agency and the Development of Women's Intercollegiate Athletics, 1961-2001." ''Historical Studies in Education'' (2003) 15#1 37-76&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multi-sports Games==

===Olympics===
{{main article|1976 Summer Olympics|1988 Winter Olympics|2010 Winter Olympics}}
Canadians have participated in the Olympics since 1900.

The 1976 Summer Olympics, officially known as the "Games of the XXI Olympiad," held in Montréal, was the first Olympics in Canada. The entire province of Quebec prepared for the games and associated activities, generating a resurgence of interest in amateur athletics across the province. The spirit of Québec nationalism helped motivate the organizers; however, the city went $1 billion into debt.&lt;ref&gt;Patrick Allen, "Les Jeux Olympiques: Icebergs ou Rampes de Lancements?," [The Olympic Games: Icebergs or launching pads?] ''Action Nationale'' (1976) 65#5 pp 271-323&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Paul Charles Howell, ''The Montreal Olympics: An Insider's View of Organizing a Self-financing Games'' (Montréal: McGill-Queens University Press, 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;  The Games helped introduce Quebec (and Canada) to the rest of the world. [[Nadia Comaneci]]'s outstanding performances in gymnastics helped popularize the sport in Canada.&lt;ref&gt;Pierre Cayouette, "Montreal 1976" ''Beaver'' (2009) 89#6 pp 42-44.&lt;/ref&gt;

Like Montreal, Calgary, Alberta, which hosted the [[1988 Winter Olympics]], used the event to reposition itself as world-class city.&lt;ref&gt;David Whitson, "Bringing the world to Canada: 'the periphery of the centre,'" ''Third World Quarterly''  (2004) 25#7 pp 1215-1232.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[2010 Winter Olympics]], officially known as the XXI Olympic Winter Games, was held from February 12 to February 28, 2010, in Vancouver, British Columbia, and nearby venues.

===Commonwealth Games===
Canada hosted the [[1930 British Empire Games|first ever British Empire Games in 1930]] in [[Hamilton, Ontario]], as well as the [[1954 British Empire and Commonwealth Games]] in [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], the [[1978 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Edmonton|Edmonton, Alberta]], and the [[1994 Commonwealth Games]] in [[Victoria, British Columbia]]. [[Halifax Urban Area|Halifax, Nova Scotia]] had been nominated to host the [[2014 Commonwealth Games]] before it withdrew its bid due to unacceptably high cost projections.

===Pan American Games===
{{main article|1967 Pan American Games|1999 Pan American Games|2015 Pan American Games}}
Canada hosted three [[Pan American Games]]. Winnipeg hosted the [[1967 Pan American Games]] and the [[1999 Pan American Games]]. Toronto hosted the [[2015 Pan American Games]]. The Toronto 2015 Pan American Games was the largest multi-sport event hosted in Canada in terms of athletes competing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=David |last=Peterson |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/globe-debate/why-toronto-should-get-excited-about-the-pan-am-games/article19543736/ |title=Why Toronto should get excited about the Pan Am Games |work=The Globe and Mail |date=July 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Imagery''', in a literary text, is an author's use of vivid and descriptive language to add depth to their work. It appeals to human senses to deepen the reader's understanding of the work. Powerful forms of imagery engage all of the senses.

==Forms== 
There are seven major types of imagery, each corresponding to a sense, feeling, action, or reaction:

*'''Visual imagery''' pertains to graphics, visual scenes, pictures, or the sense of sight.
*'''Auditory imagery''' pertains to sounds, noises, music, or the sense of hearing. (This kind of imagery may come in the form of [[onomatopoeia]]).
*'''Olfactory imagery''' pertains to odors, scents, or the sense of smell.
*'''Gustatory imagery''' pertains to flavors or the sense of taste.
*'''Tactile imagery''' pertains to physical textures or the sense of touch.

===Less used===
*'''Kinesthetic imagery''' pertains to movements.
*'''Organic imagery / subjective imagery''', pertains to personal experiences of a character's body, including emotion and the senses of hunger, thirst, fatigue, and pain.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetics of Robert Frost: Examples|url=http://www.frostfriends.org/imagery.html|publisher=Friends of Robert Frost|accessdate=12 March 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''[http://www.j-pop.com J-POP SUMMIT]''', hosted by SUPERFROG Project, a 501(c)(3) non-profit organization, is a Japanese cultural festival held every summer since 2009 in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], United States.[[J-Pop Summit#cite note-1|&lt;sup&gt;[1]&lt;/sup&gt;]] By introducing the latest in Japanese music, fashion, film, art, games, tech-innovations, [[anime]], food, as well as niche subcultures, the festival has become a landing platform for new trends from [[Japan]].[[J-Pop Summit#cite note-2|&lt;sup&gt;[2]&lt;/sup&gt;]] The festival is also getting attention by foreign companies and organizations as an effective promotional opportunity and an entry point into US markets. In 2014, the festival was held in [[Japantown, San Francisco|Japantown]] and enjoyed 120,000 in attendance in two days. Since 2015, the festival expanded its area to different locations in the city; [[Fort Mason|Fort Mason Center]], [[Union Square, San Francisco|Union Square]], NEW PEOPLE Cinema and [[Castro Theatre]] and successfully re-launched as an indoor event.  J-POP SUMMIT in 2018 was canceled due to unforeseen circumstances with the venue. Website http://www.j-pop.com

== History ==
J-POP SUMMIT first took place as the opening ceremony of NEW PEOPLE building at Japan Town in San Francisco in 2009. Since then it has become an annual festival to introduce the latest Japanese pop culture including Anime, Manga, Food, Sake, Games, Fashion, Films, and Music. In recent years, Interactive (tech innovations) and Travel have been added to its content diversity to make stronger bonds between IT companies in the two countries and also to revitalize Japanese inbound tourism from the US. The event has provided good opportunities for Japanese companies to expand their business to the U.S. market.[[J-Pop Summit#cite note-4|&lt;sup&gt;[4]&lt;/sup&gt;]][[J-Pop Summit#cite note-5|&lt;sup&gt;[5]&lt;/sup&gt;]]

== Location ==
J-POP SUMMIT was held in Japantown as a free outdoor event from 2009 until 2014, and it moved to Fort Mason Center in 2015. When it was in Japantown, the streets were turned into a pedestrian precinct. The number of attendees kept increasing year by year and finally in 2014, it went over the crowd capacity of Japantown. Thus J-POP SUMMIT made its big move to an indoor festival venue to pursue the next level of exhibition and staging, and became a ticketed event in 2015. In 2017, J-POP SUMMIT will be held again at the Fort Mason Center For Arts &amp; Culture (Festival Pavilion, Firehouse and outside Parking area)

'''Pantaleón Villegas y Soldi''' (July 27, 1873 – April 8, 1898)  better known as '''León Kilat''' ("Lightning Lion" in [[Cebuano language|Cebuano]]), was a [[revolutionary]] leader in [[Cebu]] during the [[Philippine Revolution]] against [[Spain]].  He was born in Bacong, [[Negros Oriental]], to Don Policarpio Villegas and Doña Úrsula Soldi. His grandfather was Don Pedro Villegas, a native of [[Spain]], and Dorotea, a daughter of a ''capitán'' of [[Bacong]].

In 1895, he worked at Botica Antigua located in the corner of Calle del Palacio and Calle Legazpi (Burgos and Legazpi). It was a well-known drugstore frequented by many Cebuanos. With him were Ciriaco Murillo and Eulogio Duque who told the writer [[Manuel Enríquez de la Calzada]] that Pantaleón actually used the name "Eulogio", instead of Pantaleón. Because there were two Eulogios working in the drugstore, the [[Germans|German]] owner had to call him instead "León". Why he used the name "Eulogio" was not known.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20091026192428/http://geocities.com/lkilat/&lt;/ref&gt;

Villegas did not stay long at Botica Antigua. He transferred to a bakery in Pahina (Fagina). From there he moved on to a circus owned by [[Tagalogs]] on their way to [[Manila]]. The circus happened to be owned by a [[katipunero]]. It was there that he was recruited into the secret council of the [[Katipunan]].

During the rebellion against Spain, Kilat led the revolutionaries in [[Cebu Province|Cebu]].  Initially intending to begin the rebellion on Easter Sunday, he was forced to change his plans when the Spaniards discovered the planned revolt.  Kilat and his men began the rebellion in Cebu on [[Palm Sunday]], April 3, 1898. He was, however, betrayed and murdered on [[Good Friday]], April 8, 1898, in [[Carcar, Cebu]]. He was stabbed to death by his own [[aide-de-camp]], Apolinario Alcuitas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title =Western Visayas:Pantaleon Villegas | url=http://www.msc.edu.ph/centennial/hero/wv/page8.html | accessdate = 2007-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The town of Bacong in Negros Oriental has honored Villegas with a statue erected in the town plaza in 1926. On July 27, 2008, the 135th anniversary of Villegas' birth, the Philippine National Historical Institute turned over a historical marker in honor of Villegas to local and provincial officials in his hometown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | last =Pal | first =Alex | title =Bacong remembers Leon Kilat's heroism | pages =18 | publisher =The Visayan Daily Star | date = 2008-08-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Literature}}

'''Literature''', most generically, is any body of written works. More restrictively, literature refers to writing considered to be an art form or any single writing deemed to have artistic or intellectual value, often due to deploying language in ways that differ from ordinary usage.

Its Latin root ''literatura''/''litteratura'' (derived itself from ''littera'': ''letter'' or ''handwriting'') was used to refer to all written accounts. The concept has changed meaning over time to include texts that are spoken or sung ([[oral literature]]), and non-written verbal art forms. [[History of printing|Developments in print technology]] have allowed an ever-growing distribution and proliferation of written works, culminating in [[electronic literature]].

Literature is classified according to whether it is [[fiction]] or [[non-fiction]], and whether it is [[poetry]] or [[prose]]. It can be further distinguished according to major forms such as the [[novel]], [[short story]] or [[drama]]; and works are often categorized according to historical periods or their adherence to certain [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] features or expectations ([[genre]]).

== Definitions ==
Definitions of literature have varied over time: it is a "culturally relative definition".&lt;ref name="Leitch ''et al.'', ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'', 28"&gt;Leitch ''et al.'', ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'', 28&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Western Europe]] prior to the 18th century, literature denoted all books and writing.&lt;ref name="Leitch ''et al.'', ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'', 28" /&gt; A more restricted sense of the term emerged during the [[Romanticism|Romantic period]], in which it began to demarcate "imaginative" writing.&lt;ref name="Ross, The Emergence of Literature: Making and Reading the English Canon in the Eighteenth Century, 406"&gt;Ross, "The Emergence of "Literature": Making and Reading the English Canon in the Eighteenth Century", 406&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Eagleton|2008|p=16}} Contemporary debates over what constitutes literature can be seen as returning to older, more inclusive notions; [[Cultural studies]], for instance, takes as its subject of analysis both popular and minority genres, in addition to [[Western canon|canonical works]].

The [[value judgment]] definition of literature considers it to cover exclusively those writings that possess high quality or distinction, forming part of the so-called ''[[belles-lettres]]'' ('fine writing') tradition.{{sfn|Eagleton|2008|p=9}} This sort of definition is that used in the [[Encyclopædia Britannica Eleventh Edition|''Encyclopædia Britannica'' Eleventh Edition]] (1910–11) when it classifies literature as "the best expression of the best thought reduced to writing."&lt;ref name="Biswas, ''Critique of Poetics'', 538"&gt;Biswas, ''Critique of Poetics'', 538&lt;/ref&gt; Problematic in this view is that there is no objective definition of what constitutes "literature": anything can be literature, and anything which is universally regarded as literature has the potential to be excluded, since value judgments can change over time.{{sfn|Eagleton|2008|p=9}}

The [[Formalism (literature)|formalist]] definition is that "literature" foregrounds poetic effects; it is the "literariness" or "poetic" of literature that distinguishes it from ordinary speech or other kinds of writing (e.g., [[journalism]]).&lt;ref name="Leitch ''et al.'', ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'', 4"&gt;Leitch ''et al.'', ''The Norton Anthology of Theory and Criticism'', 4&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Eagleton|2008|p=2-6}} Jim Meyer considers this a useful characteristic in explaining the use of the term to mean published material in a particular field (e.g., "[[scientific literature]]"), as such writing must use language according to particular standards.&lt;ref name="meyer"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Meyer|first=Jim|year=1997|title=What is Literature? A Definition Based on Prototypes|url=http://www.und.nodak.edu/dept/linguistics/wp/1997Meyer.htm|journal=Work Papers of the Summer Institute of Linguistics, University of North Dakota Session|volume=41|issue=1|accessdate=11 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The problem with the formalist definition is that in order to say that literature deviates from ordinary uses of language, those uses must first be identified; this is difficult because "[[ordinary language]]" is an unstable category, differing according to social categories and across history.{{sfn|Eagleton|2008|p=4}}

[[Etymology|Etymologically]], the term derives from [[Latin language|Latin]] ''literatura/litteratura'' "learning, a writing, grammar," originally "writing formed with letters," from ''litera/littera'' "letter".&lt;ref name=oetyd&gt;{{cite web|title=literature (n.)|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=literature&amp;allowed_in_frame=0|publisher=Online Etymology Dictionary|accessdate=9 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In spite of this, the term has also been applied to [[Oral literature|spoken or sung texts]].&lt;ref name=meyer /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Finnegan|first=Ruth|title=How Oral Is Oral Literature?|journal=Bulletin of the School of Oriental and African Studies|year=1974|volume=37|issue=1|pages=52–64|jstor=614104|doi=10.1017/s0041977x00094842 }} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Genres ===
[[Literary genre]] is a mode of categorizing literature. A French term for "a literary type or class".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Meyer Howard |last=Abrams |author-link=Meyer Howard Abrams |title=Glossary of Literary Terms |publisher=[[Harcourt Brace College Publishers]] |location=New York |year=1999 |page=108 |url=https://books.google.es/books?id=vTAJAAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA108 |isbn=9780155054523}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, such classes are subject to change, and have been used in different ways in different periods and traditions.

== History ==
{{Main article|History of literature}}
[[File:LuxorTemple03.jpg|thumb|left|alt=Inscribed hieroglyphics cover an obelisk in foreground. A stone statue is in background.|[[Egyptian hieroglyphs]] with [[cartouche]]s for the name "[[Ramesses II]]", from the [[Luxor Temple]], [[New Kingdom]]]]
The history of literature follows closely the development of [[civilization]]. When defined exclusively as written work, [[Ancient Egyptian literature]],{{sfn|Foster|2001|p=19}} along with [[Sumerian literature]], are considered the world's [[Ancient literature|oldest literatures]].&lt;ref name="Black et al. ''The Literature of Ancient Sumer'', xix"&gt;Black et al. ''The Literature of Ancient Sumer'', xix&lt;/ref&gt; The primary [[genre]]s of the literature of [[Ancient Egypt]]—[[Didacticism|didactic]] texts, hymns and prayers, and tales—were written almost entirely in verse;{{sfn|Foster|2001|p=7}} while use of poetic devices is clearly recognizable, the [[prosody (linguistics)|prosody]] of the verse is unknown.{{sfn|Foster|2001|p=8}}{{sfn|Foster|2001|p=9}} Most [[Sumerian literature]] is apparently [[poetry]],&lt;ref&gt;Michalowski p. 146&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Black p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; as it is written in left-justified lines,&lt;ref&gt;Black et al., Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; and could contain line-based organization such as the [[couplet]] or the [[stanza]],&lt;ref&gt;Michalowski p. 144&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Original research|section|date=April 2017}}Different historical periods are reflected in literature. National and tribal sagas, accounts of the origin of the world and of customs, and myths which sometimes carry moral or spiritual messages predominate in the pre-urban eras. The epics of [[Homer]], dating from the early to middle [[Iron age]], and the great [[Indian epic poetry|Indian epics]] of a slightly later period, have more evidence of deliberate literary authorship, surviving like the older myths through oral tradition for long periods before being written down.

Literature in all its forms can be seen as written records, whether the literature itself be factual or fictional, it is still quite possible to decipher facts through things like characters' actions and words or the authors' style of writing and the intent behind the words. The plot is for more than just entertainment purposes; within it lies information about economics, psychology, science, religions, politics, cultures, and social depth. Studying and analyzing literature becomes very important in terms of learning about human history. Literature provides insights about about how society has evolved and about the societal norms during each of the different periods all throughout history. For instance, [[Postmodernism|postmodern]] authors argue that history and fiction both constitute systems of signification by which we make sense of the past.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Timothy Findley's Novels Between Ethics and Postmodernism|last=Krause|first=Dagmar|publisher=Königshausen &amp; Neumann|year=2005|isbn=3826030052|location=Wurzburg|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is asserted that both of these are "discourses, [[Social constructionism|human constructs]], signifying systems, and both derive their major claim to truth from that identity."&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Literature provides views of life, which is crucial in obtaining truth and in understanding human life throughout history and its periods.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Philosophy, Literature and the Human Good|last=Weston|first=Michael|publisher=Routledge|year=2001|isbn=0415243378|location=London|pages=xix, 133}}&lt;/ref&gt; Specifically, it explores the possibilities of living in terms of certain values under given social and historical circumstances.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Literature helps us understand references made in more modern literature because authors often reference mythology and other old religious texts to describe ancient civilizations such as the Hellenes and the Egyptians.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Historical-critical Introduction to the Philosophy of Mythology|last=Schelling|first=F.W.J.|publisher=SUNY Press|year=2007|isbn=9780791471319|location=New York|pages=49}}&lt;/ref&gt; Not only is there literature written on each of the aforementioned topics themselves, and how they have evolved throughout history (like a book about the history of economics or a book about evolution and science, for example) but one can also learn about these things in fictional works. Authors often include historical moments in their works, like when Lord Byron talks about the Spanish and the French in "Childe Harold's Pilgrimage: Canto I"&lt;ref&gt;Lord Byron, (2008) Childe Harold’s Pilgrimage: Canto I.  Lord Byron: The Major Works. ed. McGann, J.J. New York: Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt; and expresses his opinions through his character Childe Harold. Through literature we are able to continuously uncover new information about history. It is easy to see how all academic fields have roots in literature.&lt;ref name="go.galegroup.com"&gt;English: a degree for the curious. (2013, September 16). UWIRE Text, p. 1. Retrieved from:http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?id=GALE%7CA342994126&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=otta77973&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;asid=0b1f124b2250452bd1bab5551e352af3&lt;/ref&gt; Information became easier to pass down from generation to generation once we began to write it down. Eventually everything was written down, from things like home remedies and cures for illness, or how to build shelter to traditions and religious practices. From there people were able to study literature, improve on ideas, further our knowledge, and academic fields such as the medical field or trades could be started. In much the same way as the literature that we study today continue to be updated as we{{Who|date=April 2017}} continue to evolve and learn more and more.

As a more urban culture developed, academies provided a means of transmission for speculative and philosophical literature in early civilizations, resulting in the prevalence of literature in [[History of China#Ancient China|Ancient China]], [[Ancient India]], [[History of Iran|Persia]] and [[Classical antiquity|Ancient Greece and Rome]]. Many works of earlier periods, even in narrative form, had a covert moral or didactic purpose, such as the Sanskrit ''[[Panchatantra]]'' or the ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' of Ovid. [[Drama]] and [[satire]] also developed as urban culture provided a larger public audience, and later readership, for literary production. [[Lyric poetry]] (as opposed to epic poetry) was often the speciality of courts and aristocratic circles, particularly in East Asia where songs were collected by the Chinese aristocracy as poems, the most notable being the ''Shijing'' or ''[[Book of Songs (Chinese)|Book of Songs]]''. Over a long period, the poetry of popular pre-literate balladry and song interpenetrated and eventually influenced poetry in the literary medium.

In ancient China, early literature was primarily focused on philosophy, [[historiography]], [[military science]], agriculture, and [[Chinese poetry|poetry]]. China, the origin of modern [[paper making]] and [[woodblock printing]], produced the world's first [[print culture]]s.&lt;ref&gt;A Hyatt Mayor, Prints and People, Metropolitan Museum of Art/Princeton, 1971, nos 1–4. {{ISBN|0-691-00326-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Much of Chinese literature originates with the [[Hundred Schools of Thought]] period that occurred during the [[Zhou Dynasty|Eastern Zhou Dynasty]] (769‒269 BCE). The most important of these include the Classics of [[Confucianism]], of [[Taoism|Daoism]], of [[Mohism]], of [[Legalism (Chinese philosophy)|Legalism]], as well as works of military science (e.g. [[Sun Tzu]]'s ''[[The Art of War]]'') and [[History of China|Chinese history]] (e.g. [[Sima Qian]]'s ''[[Records of the Grand Historian]]''). Ancient Chinese literature had a heavy emphasis on historiography, with often very detailed court records. An exemplary piece of [[narrative history]] of ancient China was the ''[[Zuo Zhuan]]'', which was compiled no later than 389 BCE, and attributed to the blind 5th-century BCE historian [[Zuo Qiuming]].

In ancient India, literature originated from stories that were originally orally transmitted. Early genres included [[Sanskrit drama|drama]], [[Panchatantra|fables]], [[Sūtra|sutras]] and [[Indian epic poetry|epic poetry]]. [[Sanskrit literature]] begins with the [[Vedas]], dating back to 1500–1000 BCE, and continues with the [[Sanskrit Epics]] of [[Iron Age India]]. The Vedas are among the [[Ancient literature|oldest sacred texts]]. The Samhitas (vedic collections) date to roughly 1500–1000 BCE, and the "circum-Vedic" texts, as well as the [[shakha|redaction]] of the Samhitas, date to c. 1000‒500 BCE, resulting in a [[Vedic period]], spanning the mid-2nd to mid 1st millennium BCE, or the [[Bronze Age|Late Bronze Age]] and the [[Iron Age India|Iron Age]].&lt;ref name="Flood"&gt;[[Gavin Flood]] sums up mainstream estimates, according to which the Rigveda was compiled from as early as 1500 BCE over a period of several centuries. {{Harvnb|Flood|1996|p=37}}&lt;/ref&gt; The period between approximately the 6th to 1st centuries BCE saw the composition and redaction of the two most influential Indian epics, the ''[[Mahabharata]]'' and the ''[[Ramayana]]'', with subsequent redaction progressing down to the 4th century AD. Other major literary works are [[Ramcharitmanas]] &amp; Krishnacharitmanas.

In ancient Greece, the epics of [[Homer]], who wrote the ''[[Iliad]]'' and the ''[[Odyssey]]'', and [[Hesiod]], who wrote ''[[Works and Days]]'' and ''[[Theogony]]'', are some of the earliest, and most influential, of Ancient Greek literature. Classical Greek genres included philosophy, [[poetry]], historiography, [[comedies]] and [[drama]]s. [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] authored philosophical texts that are the foundation of [[Western philosophy]], [[Sappho]] and [[Pindar]] were influential [[lyric poetry|lyric poets]], and [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]] were early Greek historians. Although drama was popular in Ancient Greece, of the hundreds of [[tragedy|tragedies]] written and performed during the [[classical age]], only a limited number of plays by three authors still exist: [[Aeschylus]], [[Sophocles]], and [[Euripides]]. The plays of [[Aristophanes]] provide the only real examples of a genre of comic drama known as [[Ancient Greek comedy|Old Comedy]], the earliest form of Greek Comedy, and are in fact used to define the genre.&lt;ref&gt;''Aristophanes: Butts'' K.J.Dover (ed), Oxford University Press 1970, Intro. p. x.&lt;/ref&gt;

Roman histories and biographies anticipated the extensive mediaeval literature of lives of saints and miraculous chronicles, but the most characteristic form of the [[Middle Ages]] was the [[Romance (heroic literature)|romance]], an adventurous and sometimes magical narrative with strong popular appeal. Controversial, religious, political and instructional literature proliferated during the Renaissance as a result of the invention of printing, while the mediaeval romance developed into a more character-based and psychological form of narrative, the [[novel]], of which early and important examples are the Chinese [[Journey to the West|Monkey]] and the German [[Goethe's Faust|Faust]] books.

In the [[Age of Reason]] philosophical tracts and speculations on history and human nature integrated literature with social and political developments. The inevitable reaction was the explosion of [[Romanticism]] in the later 18th century which reclaimed the imaginative and fantastical bias of old romances and folk-literature and asserted the primacy of individual experience and emotion. But as the 19th century went on, European fiction evolved towards [[Realism (arts)|realism]] and [[Naturalism (literature)|naturalism]], the meticulous documentation of real life and social trends. Much of the output of naturalism was implicitly polemical, and influenced social and political change, but 20th century fiction and drama moved back towards the subjective, emphasizing unconscious motivations and social and environmental pressures on the individual. Writers such as [[Marcel Proust|Proust]], [[T.S.Eliot|Eliot]], [[James Joyce|Joyce]], [[Franz Kafka|Kafka]] and [[Luigi Pirandello|Pirandello]] exemplify the trend of documenting internal rather than external realities.

[[Genre fiction]] also showed it could question reality in its 20th century forms, in spite of its fixed formulas, through the enquiries of the skeptical [[Detective fiction|detective]] and the alternative realities of [[science fiction]]. The separation of "mainstream" and "genre" forms (including journalism) continued to blur during the period up to our own times. [[William Burroughs]], in his early works, and [[Hunter S. Thompson]] expanded documentary reporting into strong subjective statements after the [[World War II|second World War]], and [[Postmodernism|post-modern]] critics have disparaged the idea of objective realism in general.

==Psychology and literature==
Theorists suggest that literature allows readers to access intimate emotional aspects of a person's character that would not be obvious otherwise.{{sfn|Hogan|2011|p=1}} That literature aids the psychological development and understanding of the reader, allowing someone to access emotional states from which they had distanced themselves. D. Mitchell, for example, explains how one author used young adult literature to describes  a state of "wonder" she had experienced as a child.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |jstor = 821301|title = From the Secondary Section: Young Adult Literature and the English Teacher|journal = The English Journal|volume = 90|issue = 3|pages = 23–25|last1 = Mitchell|first1 = Diana|year = 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are also those who focus on the significance of literature in an individual's psychological development. For example, language learning uses literature because it articulates or contains culture, which is an element considered crucial in learning a language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=vBcsaEQmwBEC&amp;pg=PT10&amp;dq=literature+importance+in+psychology+reading&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjfoNrb3fXeAhUENY8KHV69Dk4Q6AEIQjAE#v=onepage&amp;q=literature%20importance%20in%20psychology%20reading&amp;f=false|title=So-called "Alternative FLL-Approaches"|last=Oebel|first=Guido|date=|publisher=GRIN Verlag|year=2001|isbn=9783640187799|location=Norderstedt|pages=|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is demonstrated in the case of a study that revealed how the presence of cultural values and culturally familiar passages in literary texts played an important impact on the performance of minority students in English reading.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Handbook of Child Psychology, Child Psychology in Practice|last=Damon|first=William|last2=Lerner|first2=Richard|last3=Renninger|first3=Ann|last4=Sigel|first4=Irving|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|year=2006|isbn=0471272876|location=Hoboken, NJ|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologists have also been using literature as a tool or therapeutic vehicle for people, to help them understand challenges and issues. An example is the integration of subliminal messages in literary texts or the rewriting of traditional narratives to help readers address their problems or mold them into contemporary social messages.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Discontinuous Discourses in Modern Russian Literature|last=Makin|first=Michael|last2=Kelly|first2=Catriona|last3=Shepher|first3=David|last4=de Rambures|first4=Dominique|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|year=1989|isbn=9781349198511|location=New York|pages=122}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Children's Literature and its Effects|last=Cullingford|first=Cedric|publisher=A&amp;C Black|year=1998|isbn=0304700924|location=London|pages=5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hogan also explains that the time and emotion which a person devotes to understanding a character's situation makes literature "ecological[ly] valid in the study of emotion".{{sfn|Hogan|2011|p=10}} That is literature unites a large community by provoking universal emotions, as well s allowing readers to access cultural aspects that they have not been exposed to, and that produce new emotional experiences.{{sfn|Hogan|2011|p=11}} Theorists argue that authors choose literary device according to what psychological emotion they are attempting to describe.&lt;ref name="Nezami, S. R. A. 2012"&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Nezami |first=S.R.A. |date=February 2012 |title=The use of figures of speech as a literary device—a specific mode of expression in English literature |url=http://go.galegroup.com/ps/i.do?action=interpret&amp;id=GALE%7CA283834622&amp;v=2.1&amp;u=otta77973&amp;it=r&amp;p=AONE&amp;sw=w&amp;authCount=1 |journal=Language in India |volume=12 |issue=2 |pages=659–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some psychologists regard literature as a valid research tool, because it allows them to discover new psychological ideas.{{sfn|Hogan|2011|p=19}} Psychological theories about literature, such as [[Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs]] have become universally recognized.

Psychologist [[Abraham Maslow|Maslow's]] "Third Force Psychology Theory" helps literary analysts to critically understand how characters reflect the culture and the history to which they belong. It also allows them to understand the author's intention and psychology.{{sfn|Paris|1986|p=61}} The theory suggests that human beings possess within them their true "self" and that the fulfillment of this is the reason for living. It also suggests that neurological development hinders actualizing this and a person becomes estranged from his or her true self.{{sfn|Paris|1986|p=25}} Maslow argues that literature explores this struggle for self-fulfillment.&lt;ref name="Nezami, S. R. A. 2012" /&gt; Paris in his "Third Force Psychology and the Study of Literature" argues that "[[D.H. Lawrence]]'s 'pristine unconscious' is a metaphor for the real self".{{sfn|Paris|1986|p=65}} Literature, it is here suggested, is therefore a tool that allows readers to develop and apply critical reasoning to the nature of emotions.

Poetry is a form of literary art which uses the [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]] qualities of language (including music, and [[rhythm]]) to evoke meanings beyond a [[prose]] paraphrase.&lt;ref name=oedpoetry&gt;{{cite web|title=poetry, n.|url=http://www.oed.com/view/Entry/146552|work=Oxford English Dictionary|publisher=OUP|accessdate=13 February 2014}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; Poetry has traditionally been distinguished from [[prose]] by its being set in [[Verse (poetry)|verse]]; prose is cast in [[Sentence (linguistics)|sentences]], poetry in [[Line (poetry)|lines]]; the [[syntax]] of prose is dictated by meaning, whereas that of poetry is held across meter or the visual aspects of the poem.{{sfn|Preminger|1993|p=938}}{{sfn|Preminger|1993|p=939}} This distinction is complicated by various hybrid forms such as the [[prose poem]]&lt;ref name=prosepoemaap&gt;{{cite web|title=Poetic Form: Prose Poem|url=http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5787|work=Poets.org|publisher=Academy of American Poets|accessdate=15 February 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131002221057/http://www.poets.org/viewmedia.php/prmMID/5787|archivedate=2 October 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[prosimetrum]],{{sfn|Preminger|1993|p=981}} and more generally by the fact that prose possesses rhythm.{{sfn|Preminger|1993|p=979}} Abram Lipsky refers to it as an "open secret" that "prose is not distinguished from poetry by lack of rhythm".&lt;ref name=lipsky&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lipsky|first=Abram|title=Rhythm in Prose|journal=The Sewanee Review|year=1908|volume=16|issue=3|pages=277–289|jstor=27530906}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Prior to the 19th century, poetry was commonly understood to be something set in metrical lines; accordingly, in 1658 a definition of poetry is "any kind of subject consisting of {{sic|hide=y|Rhythm}} or Verses".&lt;ref name=oedpoetry /&gt; Possibly as a result of [[Aristotle]]'s influence (his ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]''), "poetry" before the 19th century was usually less a technical designation for verse than a normative category of fictive or rhetorical art.&lt;ref name="Ross, The Emergence of Literature: Making and Reading the English Canon in the Eighteenth Century, 398"&gt;Ross, "The Emergence of "Literature": Making and Reading the English Canon in the Eighteenth Century", 398&lt;/ref&gt; As a form it may pre-date [[literacy]], with the earliest works being composed within and sustained by an oral tradition;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Finnegan|first=Ruth H.|title=Oral poetry: its nature, significance, and social context|year=1977|publisher=Indiana University Press|page=66}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=magoun&gt;{{cite journal|last=Magoun, Jr.|first=Francis P.|title=Oral-Formulaic Character of Anglo-Saxon Narrative Poetry|journal=Speculum|year=1953|volume=28|issue=3|pages=446–467|jstor=2847021|doi=10.2307/2847021}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; hence it constitutes the earliest example of literature.

== Prose ==
{{Main article|Prose|Literary fiction}}
Prose is a form of [[language]] that possesses ordinary [[syntax]] and [[natural speech]], rather than a regular [[Metre (poetry)|metre]]; in which regard, along with its [[presentation]] in sentences rather than lines, it differs from most poetry.{{sfn|Preminger|1993|p=938}}{{sfn|Preminger|1993|p=939}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Glossary: P|url=http://www.wwnorton.com/college/english/litweb10/glossary/P.aspx|work=LitWeb, the Norton Introduction to Literature Studyspace|accessdate=15 February 2014|author=Alison Booth|author2=Kelly J. Mays }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, developments in modern literature, including [[free verse]] and [[prose poetry]] have tended to blur any differences, and American poet [[T.S. Eliot]] suggested that while: "the distinction between [[Verse (poetry)|verse]] and prose is clear, the distinction between [[poetry]] and prose is obscure".&lt;ref&gt;Eliot T.S. 'Poetry &amp; Prose: The Chapbook. Poetry Bookshop: London, 1921.&lt;/ref&gt;

On the historical development of prose, Richard Graff notes that "[In the case of [[Ancient Greece]]] recent scholarship has emphasized the fact that formal prose was a comparatively late development, an "invention" properly associated with the [[Classical antiquity|classical period]]".&lt;ref name=graff&gt;{{cite journal|last=Graff|first=Richard|title=Prose versus Poetry in Early Greek Theories of Style|journal=Rhetorica: A Journal of the History of Rhetoric|year=2005|volume=23|issue=4|pages=303–335|jstor=10.1525/rh.2005.23.4.303|doi=10.1525/rh.2005.23.4.303}} {{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Philosophical, historical, journalistic, and scientific writings are traditionally ranked as literature. They offer some of the oldest prose writings in existence; novels and prose stories earned the names "fiction" to distinguish them from factual writing or nonfiction, which writers historically have crafted in prose.
===Fiction===
====[[Novel]]====
A long [[fictional]] prose narrative. In English, the term emerged from the [[Romance language]]s in the late 15th century, with the meaning of "news"; it came to indicate something new, without a distinction between fact or fiction.&lt;ref name=sommerville&gt;{{cite book|last=Sommerville|first=C. J.|year=1996|title=The News Revolution in England: Cultural Dynamics of Daily Information|location=Oxford|publisher=OUP|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt; The romance is a closely related long prose narrative. [[Walter Scott]] defined it as "a fictitious narrative in prose or verse; the interest of which turns upon marvellous and uncommon incidents", whereas in the novel "the events are accommodated to the ordinary train of human events and the modern state of society".&lt;ref&gt;"Essay on Romance", ''Prose Works'' volume vi, p.&amp;nbsp;129, quoted in "Introduction" to Walter Scott's ''Quentin Durward'', ed. Susan Maning. Oxford: Oxford University Press, 1992, p.&amp;nbsp;xxv. Romance should not be confused with [[Harlequin Romance]].&lt;/ref&gt; Other European languages do not distinguish between romance and novel: "a novel is ''le roman'', ''der Roman'', ''il romanzo''",&lt;ref name="Doody 1996, p. 15"&gt;Doody (1996), p.&amp;nbsp;15.&lt;/ref&gt;  indicates the proximity of the forms.&lt;ref name=brooklyn&gt;{{cite web|title=The Novel|url=http://academic.brooklyn.cuny.edu/english/melani/cs6/novel.html|work=A Guide to the Study of Literature: A Companion Text for Core Studies 6, Landmarks of Literature|publisher=[[Brooklyn College]]|accessdate=22 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although there are many historical prototypes, so-called "novels before the novel",{{sfn|Goody|2006|p=19}} the modern novel form emerges late in cultural history—roughly during the eighteenth century.{{sfn|Goody|2006|p=20}} Initially subject to much criticism, the novel has acquired a dominant position amongst literary forms, both popularly and critically.&lt;ref name=brooklyn /&gt;{{sfn|Goody|2006|p=29}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Novel, Volume 2: Forms and Themes|year=2006|publisher=Princeton UP|location=Princeton|isbn=978-0-691-04948-9|page=31|editor=Franco Moretti|chapter=The Novel in Search of Itself: A Historical Morphology}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[Novella]]====
In purely quantitative terms, the novella exists between the novel and short story; the publisher [[Melville House Publishing|Melville House]] classifies it as "too short to be a novel, too long to be a short story".&lt;ref name=antrim&gt;{{Cite newspaper|last=Antrim|first=Taylor|title=In Praise of Short|journal=The Daily Beast|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2010/08/04/the-novella-is-making-a-comeback.html|accessdate=15 February 2014|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is no precise definition in terms of word or page count.{{sfn|Giraldi|2008|p=796}} [[Literary prize]]s and [[Publishing|publishing houses]] often have their own arbitrary limits,&lt;ref name=ripatrazone&gt;{{cite web|last=Ripatrazone|first=Nick|title=Taut, Not Trite: On the Novella|url=http://www.themillions.com/2013/09/taut-not-trite-on-the-novella.html|publisher=[[The Millions]]|accessdate=15 February 2014|date=2013-09-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; which vary according to their particular intentions. Summarizing the variable definitions of the novella, William Giraldi concludes "[it is a form] whose identity seems destined to be disputed into perpetuity".{{sfn|Giraldi|2008|p=793}} It has been suggested that the size restriction of the form produces various stylistic results, both some that are shared with the novel or short story,{{sfn|Giraldi|2008|p=796}}{{sfn|Giraldi|2008|p=795}}&lt;ref name=fetherling&gt;{{cite web |last=Fetherling |first=George |title=Briefly, the case for the novella |url=http://www.sevenoaksmag.com/commentary/94_comm1.html |publisher=Seven Oaks Magazine |accessdate=15 February 2014 |year=2006 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.li/20120912031610/http://www.sevenoaksmag.com/commentary/94_comm1.html |archivedate=12 September 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and others unique to the form.&lt;ref name=nortonolm&gt;{{cite web|last=Norton|first=Ingrid|title=Of Form, E-Readers, and Thwarted Genius: End of a Year with Short Novels|url=http://www.openlettersmonthly.com/of-form-e-readers-and-thwarted-genius-end-of-a-year-with-short-novels/|publisher=[[Open Letters Monthly]]|accessdate=15 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====[[Short story]]====
A dilemma in defining the "short story" as a literary form is how to, or whether one should, distinguish it from any short narrative; hence it also has a contested origin,&lt;ref name=boyd&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyd|first=William|title=A short history of the short story|url=http://www.prospectmagazine.co.uk/magazine/william-boyd-short-history-of-the-short-story/#.Uxr1EoVVO-c|publisher=Prospect Magazine|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; variably suggested as the earliest short narratives (e.g. the [[Bible]]), early short story writers (e.g. [[Edgar Allan Poe]]), or the clearly modern short story writers (e.g. [[Anton Chekhov]]).&lt;ref name=colibaba&gt;{{cite journal|last=Colibaba|first=Ştefan|title=The Nature of the Short Story: Attempts at Definition|journal=Synergy|year=2010|volume=6|issue=2|pages=220–230|url=http://synergy.ase.ro/issues/2010-vol6-no2/14-the-nature-of-the-short-story-attempts-at-definition.pdf|accessdate=6 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from its distinct size, various theorists have suggested that the short story has a characteristic subject matter or structure;&lt;ref name=rohrberger&gt;{{cite journal|last=Rohrberger|first=Mary|author2=Dan E. Burns |title=Short Fiction and the Numinous Realm: Another Attempt at Definition|journal=Modern Fiction Studies|year=1982|volume=XXVIII|issue=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=may&gt;{{cite book|last=May|first=Charles|title=The Short Story. The Reality of Artifice|year=1995|publisher=Twain|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; these discussions often position the form in some relation to the novel.&lt;ref name=pratt&gt;{{cite book|year=1994|publisher=Ohio UP|location=Athens|author=Marie Louise Pratt|editor=Charles May|title=The Short Story: The Long and the Short of It}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Essays ===
{{Main article|Essay}}
An [[essay]] consists of a discussion of a topic from an author's personal point of view, exemplified by works by [[Michel de Montaigne]] or by [[Charles Lamb (writer)|Charles Lamb]].{{fact|date=November 2018}} Genres related to the essay may include the [[memoir]] and the [[epistle]].

=== Natural science ===
As advances and specialization have made new scientific research inaccessible to most audiences, the "literary" nature of science writing has become less pronounced over the last two centuries. Now, science appears mostly in [[scientific journal|journals]]. Scientific works of [[Aristotle]], [[Nicolaus Copernicus|Copernicus]], and [[Isaac Newton|Newton]] still exhibit great value, but since the science in them has largely become outdated, they no longer serve for scientific instruction. Yet, they remain too technical to sit well in most programs of literary study. Outside of "[[history of science]]" programs, students rarely read such works.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

=== Philosophy ===
Philosophy has become an increasingly academic discipline. More of its practitioners lament this situation than occurs with the sciences; nonetheless most new philosophical work appears in [[Academic publishing|academic journals]]. Major philosophers through history—[[Plato]], [[Aristotle]], [[Socrates]], [[Augustine of Hippo|Augustine]], [[René Descartes|Descartes]], [[Søren Kierkegaard|Kierkegaard]], [[Friedrich Nietzsche|Nietzsche]]—have become as canonical as any writers. Some recent philosophy works are argued to merit the title "literature", but much of it does not, and some areas, such as [[logic]], have become extremely technical to a degree similar to that of [[mathematics]].{{fact|date=November 2018}}


=== History ===
A significant portion of historical writing ranks as literature, particularly the genre known as [[creative nonfiction]], as can a great deal of journalism, such as [[literary journalism]]. However, these areas have become extremely large, and often have a primarily utilitarian purpose: to record data or convey immediate information. As a result, the writing in these fields often lacks a literary quality, although it often(and in its better moments)has that quality. Major "literary" historians include [[Herodotus]], [[Thucydides]] and [[Procopius]], all of whom count as canonical literary figures.{{fact|date=November 2018}}


=== Law ===
[[Law]] offers more ambiguity. Some writings of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], the law tables of [[Hammurabi]] of [[Babylon]], or even the early parts of the [[Bible]] could be seen as legal literature. [[Roman law|Roman civil law]] as codified in the ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis]]'' during the reign of [[Justinian I]] of the [[Byzantine Empire]] has a reputation as significant literature. The founding documents of many countries, including [[Constitution]]s and [[Law Code]]s, can count as literature.{{fact|date=November 2018}}

== Drama ==
{{Main article|Drama}}

Drama is literature intended for [[performance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Elam|first1=Kier|title=The Semiotics of Theatre and Drama|date=1980|publisher=Methuen|location=London and New York|isbn=978-0-416-72060-0|page=98}}&lt;/ref&gt; The form is often combined with music and dance, as in [[opera]] and [[musical theatre|musical theater]]. A [[Play (theatre)|play]] is a subset of this form, referring to the written dramatic work of a [[playwright]] that is intended for performance in a theater; it comprises chiefly [[dialogue]] between [[Fictional character|characters]], and usually aims at dramatic or theatrical performance rather than at reading. A [[closet drama]], by contrast, refers to a play written to be read rather than to be performed; hence, it is intended that the meaning of such a work can be realized fully on the page.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cody|first1=Gabrielle H.|title=The Columbia Encyclopedia of Modern Drama|date=2007|publisher=Columbia University Press|location=New York City|page=271|edition=Volume 1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly all drama took verse form until comparatively recently.

[[Greek theatre|Greek drama]] exemplifies the earliest form of drama of which we have substantial knowledge. [[Tragedy]], as a dramatic [[genre]], developed as a performance associated with [[religion|religious]] and civic [[festival]]s, typically enacting or developing upon well-known [[history|historical]] or [[mythology|mythological]] themes. Tragedies generally presented very serious [[Theme (literature)|themes]]. With the advent of newer technologies, scripts written for non-stage media have been added to this form. [[War of the Worlds (radio)]] in 1938 saw the advent of literature written for radio broadcast, and many works of Drama have been adapted for film or television. Conversely, television, film, and radio literature have been adapted to printed or electronic media.

== Other narrative forms ==
* [[Electronic literature]] is a literary genre consisting of works that originate in digital environments.
* [[Film]]s, videos and broadcast [[soap opera]]s have carved out a niche which often parallels the functionality of prose fiction.
* [[Graphic novel]]s and [[comic book]]s present stories told in a combination of sequential artwork, dialogue and text.

== Literary techniques ==
{{Main article|list of narrative techniques}}
Literary technique and literary device are used by authors to produce specific effects.

Literary techniques encompass a wide range of approaches: examples for fiction are, whether a work is narrated in [[Grammatical person|first-person]], or from another perspective; whether a traditional linear narrative or a [[nonlinear narrative]] is used; the [[literary genre]] that is chosen.

Literary devices involves specific elements within the work that make it effective. Examples include [[metaphor]], [[simile]], [[ellipsis]], narrative [[Motif (narrative)|motifs]], and [[allegory]]. Even simple [[word play]] functions as a literary device. In fiction [[stream-of-consciousness narrative]] is a literary device.

== Legal status ==
{{Expand section|date=February 2014}}

=== United Kingdom ===
Literary works have been protected by copyright law from unauthorized reproduction since at least 1710.&lt;ref&gt;The Statute of Anne 1710 and the Literary Copyright Act 1842 used the term "book". However, since 1911 the statutes have referred to literary works.&lt;/ref&gt; Literary works are defined by copyright law to mean ''any work, other than a dramatic or musical work, which is written, spoken or sung, and accordingly includes (a) a table or compilation (other than a database), (b) a computer program, (c) preparatory design material for a computer program, and (d) a database.''

Literary works are not limited to works of literature, but include all works expressed in print or writing (other than dramatic or musical works).&lt;ref&gt;''University of London Press v. University Tutorial Press'' [1916]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Awards ==
{{Main article|List of literary awards}}

There are numerous [[Literary award|awards]] recognizing achievement and contribution in literature. Given the diversity of the field, awards are typically limited in scope, usually on: form, [[genre]], language, nationality and output (e.g. for first-time writers or [[debut novel]]s).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite newspaper|title=Man Booker 2013: Top 25 literary prizes|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/culture/books/bookprizes/10139413/Man-Booker-2013-Top-25-literary-prizes.html|publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group|The Telegraph]]|accessdate=8 March 2014|author=John Stock|author2=Kealey Rigden |date=2013-10-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Nobel Prize in Literature]] was one of the six [[Nobel Prizes]] established by the will of [[Alfred Nobel]] in 1895,&lt;ref name=nobelfacts&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts on the Nobel Prize in Literature|url=https://www.nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/facts/literature/index.html|work=Nobelprize.org|publisher=Nobel Media AB|accessdate=8 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and is awarded to an author on the basis of their body of work, rather than to, or for, a particular work itself.{{efn|However, in some instances a work has been cited in the explanation of why the award was given.}} Other literary prizes for which all nationalities are eligible include: the [[Neustadt International Prize for Literature]], the [[Man Booker International Prize]] and the [[Franz Kafka Prize]].

'''Melomics''' (derived from "genomics of melodies") is a computational system for the [[algorithmic composition|automatic composition of music]] (with no human intervention), based on bioinspired algorithms.&lt;ref name="BBC"/&gt;

==Technological aspects==

Melomics applies an [[evolutionary music|evolutionary approach]] to music composition, i.e., music pieces are obtained by simulated evolution. These themes compete to better adapt to a proper fitness function, generally grounded on formal and aesthetic criteria. The Melomics system encodes each theme in a genome, and the entire population of music pieces undergoes [[evo-devo]] dynamics (i.e., pieces read-out mimicking a complex embryological development process).&lt;ref name="AIM"&gt;{{cite journal |last= Sánchez|first= C|last2= Moreno |first2= F|last3= Albarracin |first3= D |last4= Fernandez |first4= JD|last5= Vico |first5= FJ|date= 2013| title= Melomics: A Case-Study of AI in Spain|url= http://geb.uma.es/images/papers/AIMAGAZINE.pdf|journal= AI Magazine|volume= 34|issue= 3|pages= 99–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Stieler|first=Wolfgang|title=Die Mozart-Maschine|journal=Technology Review (Germany)|year=2012|volume=December|pages=26–35| url =http://www.heise.de/tr/artikel/Die-Mozart-Maschine-1750720.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nature"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Ball|first=Philip| title= Algorithmic Rapture| journal= Nature| volume= 188| year =2012| pages= 456| url =http://www.readcube.com/articles/10.1038/488458a | doi = 10.1038/488458a}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last= Fernandez |first= JD|last2= Vico |first2= FJ|date= 2013| title= AI Methods in Algorithmic Composition: A Comprehensive Survey|url= http://www.jair.org/media/3908/live-3908-7454-jair.pdf|journal= Journal of Artificial Intelligence Research|volume= 48|pages= 513–582}}&lt;/ref&gt; The system is fully autonomous: once programmed, it composes music without human intervention.

This technology has been transferred to industry as an academic spin-off, Melomics Media, which has provided and reprogrammed a new computer cluster that created a huge collection of popular music. The results of this evolutionary computation are being stored in Melomics' site,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Melomics.com|url=http://Melomics.com|accessdate=6 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; which nowadays constitutes a vast repository of music content. A differentiating feature is that pieces are available in three types of formats: playable ([[MP3]]), editable ([[MIDI]] and [[MusicXML]]) and readable (score in [[PDF]]).

==Computer clusters==

The Melomics computational system includes two computer clusters: [[Melomics109]] and [[Iamus (computer)|Iamus]], dedicated to popular and artistic music, respectively.&lt;ref name="AIM" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title= Artificial music: The computers that create melodies|publisher= BBC Future|last= Ball |first= Philip| publication-date =8 August 2014| url =http://www.bbc.com/future/story/20140808-music-like-never-heard-before/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Melomics109: The largest repository of popular music===

[[Melomics109]] is cluster programmed and integrated in the Melomics system.&lt;ref name="taz"&gt;{{cite news | last=Lenhart|first=Christian| title= Die Mozart-Maschine| work= taz.de| date =13 January 2013| url =http://www.taz.de/Computer-komponiert-klassische-Musik/!108691/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its first product is a vast repository of popular music compositions (roughly 1 billion), covering all essential styles. In addition to [[MP3]], all songs are available in editable formats ([[MIDI]]);&lt;ref name="Time" /&gt; and music is licensed under [[CC0#Zero .2F Public domain|CC0]], meaning that it is freely downloadable.&lt;ref name="taz" /&gt;&lt;ref name="THP"&gt;{{cite news | last=Bosker|first=Bianca| title= Life As Francisco Vico, Creator Of The Incredible Computer-Composer Iamus| work= The Huffington Post| date =13 January 2013| url =http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2013/01/13/francisco-vico-iamus-melomics_n_2457374.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[0music (album)|0music]] is the first album published by [[Melomics109]], which is available in [[MP3]] and [[MIDI]] formats, under [[CC0#Zero .2F Public domain|CC0]] license.

It has been argued that, by making such amount of editable, original and [[royalty-free]] music accessible to people, Melomics may accelerate the process of [[commoditization]] of music, and change the way music is composed and consumed in the future.&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;{{cite news | last=Smith|first=Sylvia| title= Iamus: Is this the 21st century's answer to Mozart?| work= BBC News Technology| date =3 January 2013| url =https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/technology-20889644}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Time"&gt;{{cite news | last=Peckham|first=Matt| title= Finally, a computer that writes contemporary music without human help| work= Time Magazine| date =4 January 2013| url =http://techland.time.com/2013/01/04/finally-a-computer-that-writes-contemporary-music-without-human-help/}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="THP" /&gt;

===Iamus: First album of professional contemporary music by a non-human intelligence===

In the first stages of the development of the Melomics system, [[Iamus (computer)|Iamus]] composed ''Opus one'' (on October 15, 2010), arguably the first fragment of professional contemporary classical music ever composed by a computer in its own style, rather than attempting to emulate the style of existing composers. The first full composition (also in contemporary classic style), ''[[Hello World! (composition)|Hello World!]]'', premiered exactly one year after the creation of ''Opus one'', on October 15, 2011. Four later works premiered on July 2, 2012, and were broadcast live&lt;ref name=iamus-CD&gt;{{cite news|last=Ball|first=Philip|title=Iamus, classical music's computer composer, live from Malaga|url=https://www.theguardian.com/music/2012/jul/01/iamus-hello-world-review?newsfeed=true|accessdate=2 July 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=1 July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the School of Computer Science at Universidad de Málaga&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=School of Computer Science (University of Malaga - Spain) |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ygMRtXxqEBw&amp;feature=plcp |title=Can machines be creative? (live from Malaga) |publisher=YouTube |date=2012-07-02 |accessdate=2012-10-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; as part of the events included in the [[Alan Turing Year|Alan Turing year]]. The compositions performed at this event were later recorded by the [[London Symphony Orchestra]], creating [[Iamus (album)|Iamus' eponymous first album]], which New Scientist reported as the "first complete album to be composed solely by a computer and recorded by human musicians."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite  journal | title=Computer composer honours Turing's centenary|journal=New Scientist|date=5 July 2012|url =https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528724.300-computer-composer-honours-turings-centenary.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commenting on the quality and authenticity of the music, Stephen Smoliar, critic of classical music at ''[[The San Francisco Examiner]]'', commented "What is primary is the act of making the music itself engaged by the performers and how the listener responds to what those performers do... what is most interesting about the documents generated by Iamus is their capacity to challenge the creative talents of performing musicians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Smoliar|first=Stephen|title=Thoughts about Iamus and the composition of music by computer|newspaper=The Examiner|date=4 January 2013|url=http://geb.uma.es/otros-recuros/examiner}} Accessed: 10 January 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mighty Haag Circus''' was started by Ernest Haag (17 June 1866 - 1 Feb. 1935) in [[Shreveport, Louisiana]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circusesandsideshows.com/owners/ernesthaag.html Circuses and Sideshows, Ernest Haag, Mighty Haag Shows, with photos]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave |grid=50178616 |name=Ernest Haag }}&lt;/ref&gt; His [[circus]] toured continuously for over 40 years, from 1891 to 1935. Ernest Haag Circus toured using a boat, carts, trains, horse pulled wagons and trucks. At the time it was one of the largest traveling Circus in the [[United States]].  Many of Haag performers went on to have very successful careers after working in Haag Circus. [[Harry James]] (1916–1983) grew up in the Mighty Haag Circus as his father, Everett Robert James, was the [[bandleader]] in Mighty Haag Circus. Harry James' mother, Myrtle Maybelle (Stewart), was an [[Acrobatics|acrobat]] and horseback rider in the Circus. Maybelle and Everett liked Ernest Haag so much they gave their son his middle name, Harry Haag James. Harry James was born in [[Albany, Georgia]] while the Haag Circus was performing there. The James family departed the Circus in 1931 when Harry was 15. Laurence Brasfield of [[Uncle Cyp and Aunt Sap Brasfield]] start in the Haag Circus at age 14. Cornet player Don Essig played in Haag Circus. Starting as Haag performers Rube Walters and Heinie Emgard became a [[vaudeville]] act. Fisher's Performing Elephants continued tours after the Haag Circus ended. Ruby Haag Brown performed for 50 years in the  Haag Circus, the [[Ringling Bros. and Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus]], the [[Circus Hall of Fame]] and [[Shrine Circus]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circuswagons.org/calliopes-and-musical-instruments/mighty-haag-steam-calliope/ circuswagons.org Mighty Haag Circus]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://virginiachronicle.com/cgi-bin/virginia?a=d&amp;d=HR19360626.2.24 Virginia Chronicle, MIGHTY HAAG SHOW THREE-RING WILD ANIMAL CIRCUS COMiNG TO MONTERREY, July 2 1936, McDowell, 26 June 1936 ]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://josephinesjournal.com/sells-circus.htm Josephine Journal, Mighty Haag Circus, Sells Brothers Circus]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Beginnings==
The story goes that Ernest Haag ran away from home (Plymouth, Indiana) at age 12 to join a Circus. From Indiana he traveled to Philadelphia and New York shining shoes and selling newspapers. Then got a job as musician and an orchestra leader. Ernest played alto in the short lived ''Robinson Two-Car Show''. He started a juice business. From Philadelphia he traveled south and turned his juice business into a [[minstrel show]], that failed. He did a side show at the local [[fair]] grounds after purchasing a small tent from an old side-show man, Squire Bowman.&lt;ref&gt;[http://restorehighland.org/photogallery/2011-holiday-tour-of-homes/ Shreveport’s Highland neighborhood, Restore Highland, 2745 Fairfield Avenue - Pine Wold, Ernest Haag home]&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of 24, Ernest Haag started his circus show by purchasing a [[Flat-bottomed boat]] on the [[Red River of the South|Red River]] near Shreveport, Louisiana in 1890. He hired local performers to put his show together and called it "The Big Show". In 1895 he renamed the show the '''Mighty Haag Shows'''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/find-a-grave-prod/photos/2014/194/118964944_1405399718.jpg Mighty Haag Shows add, Lafayette]&lt;/ref&gt; Ed Conklin a local [[juggler]] was one of first performers. The show moved down the [[Catawba River]] to [[Bayou Teche]]. From there down the [[Atchafalaya river]] near [[Morgan City, Louisiana]]. In Morgan City Haag moved his show to [[carts]] and later and [[wagon]]s as he toured by land. Haag added more carts and wagon to the show as he toured Louisiana and then [[Kansas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circushistory.org/Bandwagon/bw-1947Oct.htm Hobby Bandwagon, Vol. 2, No. 9, Haag Circus Oct. 1947]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mighty Haag Circus==
The Mighty Haag Shows toured [[Mississippi]], [[Tennessee]] and [[Kentucky]]. For 10 years The Mighty Haag Shows toured through the [[Southern United States]].  In 1909 the Circus had out grown the [[horse]] and [[mule]] pulled wagons. Haag moved his Circus to 14 [[railroad car]]s calling show '''Mighty Haag Railroad Shows'''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hrc.contentdm.oclc.org/utils/ajaxhelper/?CISOROOT=p15878coll6&amp;CISOPTR=219&amp;action=2&amp;DMSCALE=20&amp;DMWIDTH=144&amp;DMHEIGHT=400&amp;DMX=0&amp;DMY=0&amp;DMTEXT=&amp;DMROTATE=0 Add for Mighty Haag Railroad Shows, Babylon, NY, July 27, 1911]&lt;/ref&gt; Carved wagons, cages for [[animals]], [[Pawnee Bill]] [[Calliope (music)|calliope wagon]] and [[chariot]]s where place in rail cars.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circushistory.org/Pdf/Billboard26May1906.pdf Billboard, page 21, Roster Mighty Haag Railroad Shows, May 26, 1906]&lt;/ref&gt; The Mighty Haag Railroad Shows toured from 1910 to 1912 in [[Eastern Canada]] including: [[Ontario]], Quebec, [[New Brunswick]], [[Nova Scotia]] and [[Prince Edward Island]], including [[Charlottetown]]. The Mighty Haag Circus toured many US states as far west as [[Montana]]. Mighty Haag Railroad Circus show had highly trained animal with [[elephant]]s, [[bear]]s, [[ponies]], [[camel]]s, [[lion]]s, [[tiger]] and blue-faced [[monkey]]s, along with [[hyena]], [[ocelot]] and [[badger]]. Tuckapo ponies act was put on by Capt. J. C. Farley. In 1915 Circus entrance fee was 35 cents. At its peak in 1918, the show had 100 workers, 3-Ring Circus in a 180 by 80 tent and 45 vehicles of all types. Circus was also known for the one-legged clown, Roy Fortune, a [[highwire walker]] and [[Acrobatics|aerialist]]; also the [[sword swallower]] Marguerite Davis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circushistory.org/History/Billboard1915.htm#1919 Circus Historical Society, Excerpts From Billboard - 1915-1917, 1919]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.swordswallow.com/halloffame.php swordswallow.com, Hall of Fame, Marguerite Davis]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bcyesteryear.com/node/621 BC Yester Year's, The Mighty Haag Railroad Shows Once Made Stops in Johnson City, 04-01-2013]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1915 Ernest Haag sold all his railroad cars to Great Wortham Shows carnival and move back to wagons, renaming the show to the '''Mighty Haag Circus'''. The wagons toured locally in Louisiana and [[Texas]]. In the early 1930 with good roads and [[truck]]s now available, Haag moved his Circus and tents to trucks. The elephants were used to help with stuck trucks. Mighty Haag Circus rested and wintered first in [[Lecompte, Louisiana]] and then later back in Shreveport. With the success of the Circus Haag had a home made in Shreveport. In 1920 the Circus moved it wintered headquarter to [[Marianna, Florida]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circusesandsideshows.com/circuses/mightyhaagshows.html Circuses and Sideshows, Mighty Haag Shows, with many photos]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circushistory.org/Bandwagon/bw-1952Sep.htm circushistory.org, Mighty Haag Shows, 1952]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.circushistory.org/Bandwagon/bw-1963Nov.htm King Bros.

Ruby also did aerial acts in the show. She was married to Harry Eugene Haag Senior for 29 years.&lt;ref&gt;[http://bucklesw.blogspot.com/2008/08/ruby-haag-obituary.html obituary Ruby Haag Brown]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.legacy.com/obituaries/tribtown/obituary.aspx?n=ruby-haag-brown-fisher&amp;pid=116198978 legacy.com, Ruby Haag Brown]&lt;/ref&gt;

For the summer of 1936 Harry Haag, Ruby Haag and Fisher family, with horses and trained dogs opened the '''Bud Hawkins Circus'''.

The brothers were in fact cousins, Roy Haag and Henry Haag. Henry was Ernest son and Roy was Ernest's nephew.

== Career ==
Young was born in London and grew up there. He came to the United States in 1992 as a manager of game design for [[Virgin Interactive]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/08/23/technology/game-designer-who-breaks-the-mold.html|title=Game Designer Who Breaks the Mold|last=Marriott|first=Michel|date=2001-08-23|work=The New York Times|access-date=2017-11-25|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt; He rose to the rank of Vice President of Product Development over four years. Young is listed as Executive Producer on Virgin's ''[[The 7th Guest]]'', a break-through PC game released in 1994. 

Young left for [[Electronic Arts]] in 1997, joining [[Origin Systems]] as General Manager overseeing the [[Ultima (series)|''Ultima'']], [[Wing Commander (franchise)|''Wing Commander'']], and ''[[Jane's Combat Simulations|Janes Combat Simulations]]'' businesses. In addition to his executive role at Origin, Young has a co-executive producer credit on the [[Wing Commander (film)|''Wing Commander'' film]]. In 1999 he moved to EA's Redwood Shores headquarters and created [[Majestic (video game)|''Majestic'']], a pioneering [[Alternate reality game|Alternate Reality]] game released in 2001. ''Majestic'' was hailed as a bold experiment in game design but was not commercially successful. After ''Majestic'', Young led the teams making console games based on the [[The Lord of the Rings (film series)|''Lord of the Rings'' movies]] for EA, overseeing ''[[The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers (video game)|The Lord of the Rings: The Two Towers]]'' and [[The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King (video game)|''The Lord of the Rings: The Return of the King'']].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mobygames.com/developer/sheet/view/developerId,1770/|title=Neil Young Video Game Credits and Biography - MobyGames|website=MobyGames|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Those games were very successful. He took over Maxis as General Manager in early 2004, then moved to Los Angeles to run [[EALA (software company)|EALA]] in late 2004. While at EALA, In 2006, Young secured a three-game deal between EA and [[Steven Spielberg]] (the games were to be collaborations between game teams at EALA and the film director). The first two games released in the partnership with Spielberg were ''[[Boom Blox]]'' and ''[[Boom Blox Bash Party]]''. Young also oversaw the release of ''[[Medal of Honor: Airborne]]'' as EALA GM. In 2007 Young left EALA and founded EA: Blueprint, a new division of EA that experimented with new intellectual property and new ways of building games.

In 2008, Young saw the potential in making games for the new [[iPhone]] and founded [[ngmoco]], a mobile game company. Funded by [[Kleiner Perkins Caufield &amp; Byers]], [[Norwest Venture Partners]], and [[Institutional Venture Partners|Instituional Venture Partners]] (among others), ngmoco released a series of mobile games including ''[[Rolando (video game)|Rolando]]'', ''[[MazeFinger]]'', ''[[GodFinger]]'', and ''[[We Farm]]''. The company also developed a new mobile platform called [[Plus+]], sparking the interest of [[DeNA Co., Ltd.|DeNA]], a large Japanese mobile game publisher. DeNA acquired ngmoco in 2010 for more than $400 Million. Young left DeNA in 2012. 

The ngmoco founding team got back together in 2013 with N3TWORK, funded (again) by Kleiner Perkins. N3TWORK's mission was to create a new app for organizing and viewing internet content. N3TWORK abandoned its content browsing app and started making mobile games in 2015. The company is enjoying some success with their current mobile game ''[[Legendary: Game of Heroes]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://venturebeat.com/2017/07/18/mobile-game-company-n3twork-acquires-agamemnon-to-create-marketing-platform/|title=Mobile game company N3twork acquires Agamemnon to create marketing platform {{!}} GamesBeat|website=venturebeat.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''number-one ticket holder''' is a person who holds membership ticket number 1 of a particular sporting club. Possession of the number one ticket is largely symbolic. The tradition of having a number one ticket holder is mainly observed in [[Australia]]. The ticket is often given to a celebrity or past sports player in order to raise the profile of the club and publicity.

==Australian Football League==
The [[Australian Football League]] is the premier [[Australian rules football]] competition in Australia. Most clubs nominate a single number one ticket holder each year.

'''Odd Ogg''' was a toy of the 1960s that was produced by the [[Ideal Toy Company]]. The ODD OGG was a half turtle and half frog and resembled a robotic version of this unique combination. Ideal Toy Company manufactured the ODD OGG in 1962. While ODD OGG might not be as popular as other toys produced by Ideal, such as Kissy doll, [[Tammy doll]], or even the [[Magic 8-ball]], it is remembered by many [[Baby Boomers]] to this day.

The ODD OGG came with four plastic balls and the objective was for the child to roll them directly into ODD OGG's center. If a child succeeded in doing this, the toy would roll towards them. If a child failed to correctly roll the ball into the underbelly of ODD OGG, then the toy would stick out its tongue and move backwards.

'''''Outland''''' is a [[comic strip]] written and illustrated by [[Berkeley Breathed]] from [[1989 in comics|1989]] until [[1995 in comics|1995]].  It was a Sunday-only [[Spin-off (media)|spin-off]] of Breathed's strip ''[[Bloom County]]'', featuring many of the same characters.

==Overview==
On September 3, 1989, a month after retiring ''Bloom County'', Breathed began his second syndicated strip with a minor character from the previous strip.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Rubin |first=Sylvia |date=August 5, 1989 |title=Fond farewell from the folks of 'Bloom County' |url=https://www.newspapers.com/clip/24860470/fond_farewell_from_the_folks_of_bloom/ |newspaper=[[Daily Press (Virginia)|Daily Press]] |publisher=The Daily Press Inc. |location=[[Newport News, Virginia]] |volume=94 |issue=217 |pages=C1,C4 |via=[[Newspapers.com]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ronald-Ann Smith]], a little girl from the "wrong side of the tracks" in Bloom County, entered a magic doorway in a grimy alley that looked down into a cheery world of "cotton-candy trees" known as the Outland (the ground of her world did not align with that of Outland, so the door originally appears to be hovering in the sky above it).

In its earliest form, ''Outland'' had been intended to be an experimental strip for Breathed, featuring a channel for creativity in the forms of new characters (such as Mortimer Mouse, based on the rejected name for [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]]'s [[Mickey Mouse]]) and bizarre backgrounds (many of which initially resembled those seen in ''[[Krazy Kat]]''). However, [[Opus the Penguin]] returned in the strip's third installment, and [[Bill the Cat]] appeared months after that. Before long, the premise of another world beyond a magic door had been lost completely.

Breathed wrote that the strip became "Bloom County without the continuing narrative that a daily appearance allows" in the first Outland book collection. Other characters from ''Bloom County'', such as [[Milquetoast the Cockroach]], [[Steve Dallas]], [[Oliver Wendell Jones]], and [[Michael Binkley]], became major players in the strip. Some characters, such as [[Cutter John]], made an occasional guest appearance. A few prominent members of ''Bloom County'', such as [[Milo Bloom]], did not make an active appearance at all (Milo did appear in the second-to-last installment of ''Outland'', as a background extra on a bus).

In 1991, Breathed wrote a children's [[Christmas]] book entitled ''[[A Wish for Wings That Work]]''. The story revolved around Opus and included several ''Outland'' characters (although the Outland itself was not explicitly referenced in the story). It was made into an animated television movie that same year.

Finally, on March 26, 1995, Breathed decided to end the strip and retire from cartooning. At the strip's end, Steve Dallas came out as [[gay]], and eloped to California with [[Mark Slackmeyer]] from the comic strip ''[[Doonesbury]]''. Opus returned to [[Antarctica]] to live with his mother, whom he had finally located (some story arcs of the original comic ''Bloom County'' focused on his quest to find her).

Eight years later, Breathed abandoned retirement and picked up where ''Outland'' had left off. The result was the Sunday-only reunion strip, ''[[Opus (comic strip)|Opus]]''.

Many ''Outland'' strips have never been reprinted in color, though all appeared in black &amp; white in ''[[Comics Revue]]'' magazine.

''Outland'' strips also appeared in the 2004 book ''Opus: 25 Years of His Sunday Best'', which reprinted strips from ''Bloom County'' and the new ''Opus'' strip as well.

'''''Popstar! Magazine''''' was a worldwide released [[teen magazine]] featuring news stories on celebrities.

==History==
''Popstar! Magazine'' is a nationally recognized teen-entertainment magazine for young adults published in print and digital editions. It was founded by editor in chief Matthew Rettenmund and was first published on October 15, 1998, with the then-new boy band [[98 Degrees]] on its inaugural cover. ''Popstar!'' was the first U.S. teen-entertainment title to be published in full color and on glossy paper throughout. In a September 1, 2004, article in ''[[Folio (magazine)|Folio]]'' magazine, media critic Simon Dumenco wrote, "''Popstar!'', in short, created a new blueprint for the teen celebrity magazine market," arguing that its design and approach influenced Bonnie Fuller and the tidal wave of celebrity tabloids of the early 2000s. The magazine later expanded to include fashion and beauty elements, albeit with a very celebrity-oriented twist. As of 2011, ''Popstar!'' was the oldest continuously published teen-entertainment title in America. ''Popstar!'.'

''Popstar!'' is known for its interaction with readers via social media. Popstar has over 330 million views on YouTube, 2 million Facebook likes, and 445,000 Twitter followers. Popstar's former Editor-in-Chief [[Colleen Broomall]] often appeared on syndicated radio and television shows as a pop culture expert.

==Circulation==
An annual survey in 2007 by [[Experian]] Simmons Research of [[Fort Lauderdale, Florida]] found that ''Popstar! Magazine'' tied [[Nickelodeon Magazine]] among American girls 8 to 14 for familiarity, with nearly one in three girls in that age group surveyed saying they had read or looked at the magazine.  Circulation was 270,148 as of December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;Olson, Elizabeth [https://www.nytimes.com/2007/05/28/business/media/28fanzine.html OMG!

'''Potrzebie''' ({{IPAc-en|p|ɒ|t|r|ə|ˈ|z|iː|b|i}}; {{IPA-pl|pɔtˈʂɛbʲe}} [[dative]]/[[locative]] of ''[[wikt:potrzeba|potrzeba]]'', "a need") is a [[Polish language|Polish]] word popularized by its [[Non sequitur (absurdism)|non sequitur]] use as a [[running gag]] in the early issues of ''[[MAD Magazine|Mad]]'' not long after the comic book began in 1952.

==Origin==
''Mad'' [[editing|editor]] [[Harvey Kurtzman]] spotted the word printed in the Polish language section of a multi-languaged "Instructions for Use" sheet accompanying a bottle of [[aspirin]], and Kurtzman, who was fascinated with unusual words, decided it would make an appropriate but meaningless background gag. After cutting the word out of the instruction sheet, he made copies and used rubber cement to paste "Potrzebie" randomly into the middle of ''Mad'' satires.

==Appearances==
''Potrzebie'' was first used in a story in ''Mad'' 11 (May 1954), where it was the exclamation of a character who spoke only in foreign languages and song lyrics, in "Murder the Story," a parody illustrated by [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]].  It was used again in [[Bernard Krigstein]]'s "From Eternity Back to Here!" in ''Mad'' 12 (June 1954) on an airplane advertising banner. With the same type font, it reappeared in Jack Davis's "Book! Movie!" in ''Mad'' 13 (July 1954), pasted into a panel as the title of an abstract painting seen in the background.  In the same issue the word appears as POTS-REBIE, emblazoned on a cauldron in which Robinson Crusoe is roasting a frankfurter. This piece reappeared in one of the earliest ''Mad'' paperbacks, ''Bedside Mad''&lt;ref&gt;''Bedside Mad''. E.C. Publications, New York, 1959, p173&lt;/ref&gt;  It was illustrated as a [[rebus]] in "Puzzle Pages!" in ''Mad'' 19 (January 1955).  These stories, like others in ''Mad'' comics, were written by Harvey Kurtzman.  Frequent repetition gave it the status of a [[catch phrase]] or [[in-joke]] among the readership which continues to the present day. In the first ''Mad Style Guide'', edited by [[Bhob Stewart]] in 1994, the word was made available for display on T-shirts and other licensed ''Mad'' products. It also sees occasional use as a [[metasyntactic variable]] by [[Hacker (programmer subculture)|hackers]].
[[Image:Potrzebie13.jpg|right|thumb|300px|Fourth appearance of the word in [[Jack Davis (cartoonist)|Jack Davis]]'s "Book! Movie!" (''Mad'' 13)]]

A typical appearance of the word is exemplified by the ''Mad'' version of [[Chaucer]]'s ''[[Canterbury Tales]]'' (from ''Mad'' 43, December 1958), which begins:
:"Whon thot Aprille swithin potrzebie,
:"The burgid prillie gives one heebie-jeebie.

==System of measurement==
In issue 33, ''Mad'' published a partial table of the "Potrzebie System of Weights and [[Units of measurement|Measures]]", developed by 19-year-old [[Donald E. Knuth]], later a famed [[computer science|computer scientist]]. According to Knuth, the basis of this new revolutionary system is the potrzebie, which equals the thickness of ''Mad'' issue 26, or 2.2633484517438173216473&amp;nbsp;mm,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knuth |first=Donald E. |year=2011 |title=Selected Papers on Fun &amp; Games |chapter=The Potrzebie System of Weights and Measures (addendum to chapter 1, a reprint of the MAD article)}}&lt;/ref&gt; although a digit was mistakenly dropped and the thickness appeared as 2.263348517438173216473&amp;nbsp;mm in the MAD article. A standardization in terms of the wavelength of the red line of the emission spectrum of [[cadmium]] is also given, which if the 1927 definition of the Ångstrom is taken for the value of that wavelength, would equal 2.263347539605392&amp;nbsp;mm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.webofstories.com/play/17067?o=R |title=DONALD KNUTH - The Potrzebie System of Weights and Measures |publisher=Webofstories.com |date=2008-01-24 |accessdate=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Volume was measured in ngogn (equal to 1000 cubic potrzebies), mass in [[blintz]] (equal to the mass of 1 ngogn of [[halavah]], which is "a form of pie [with] a [[specific gravity]] of [[Pi|3.1416]] and a specific heat of .31416"), and time in seven named units (decimal powers of the average earth rotation, equal to 1 "[[Bob Clarke (illustrator)|clarke]]"). The system also features such units as ''[[Alfred E. Neuman|whatmeworry]]'', ''[[cowznofski]]'', ''[[veeblefetzer|vreeble]]'', [[hoo-hah|''hoo'']] and [[hoo-hah|''hah'']].

According to the "Date" system in Knuth's article, which substitutes a 10-clarke "[[Norman Mingo|mingo]]" for a month and a 100-clarke "[[cowznofski]]", for a year, the date of October 29, 2007, was originally rendered as "Cal 7, 201 C.M." (for Cowznofsko Madi, or "in the Cowznofski of our MAD"). The dates are calculated from October 1, 1952, the date MAD was first published. Dates before this point are referred to, tongue-in-cheek, as "B.M." ("Before MAD.") Later Knuth preferred 0-origin indexing,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Knuth |first=Donald E. |year=2011 |title=Selected Papers on Fun &amp; Games |chapter=The Revolutionary Potrzebie (addendum to chapter 3, a reprint of an Engineering and Science Review article)}}&lt;/ref&gt; so October 29, 2007 is now rendered as "Cal 6, 201 C.M.". The ten "Mingoes" are: Tales (Tal.) Calculated (Cal.) To (To) Drive (Dri.) You (You) Humor (Hum.) In (In) A (A) Jugular (Jug.) Vein (Vei.)

[[Google calculator|Google's calculator]] can perform conversions from potrzebie system to other units.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.google.com/search?ei=Q9T4WZPBHYuB0wLR1rfICA&amp;q=3+potrzebie+%2F+2+ngogn&amp;oq=3+potrzebie+%2F+2+ngogn&amp;gs_l=psy-ab.3...216750.220355.0.221077.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0..0.0....0...1.1.64.psy-ab..0.0.0....0.d50B9hpie1k 3 potrzebie / 2 ngogn = 0.000292824232 kilometers per liter] (retrieved October 31, 2017) &lt;/ref&gt;

==Other media==
The word made an impression on many readers, for example [[Jazz music|jazz]] [[guitarist]] [[Jimmy Raney]], who recorded the tune "Potrezebie" {{sic}} on the [[album]] ''The Dual Role of Bob Brookmeyer'' (1954; reissued on [[compact disc]] in 1992). In the late 1960s, "Potrzebie" was a ''[[Jeopardy!|Jeopardy]]'' category.

"Potrzebie" became the default [[password]] for the #1 (which is "God" or the root account) [[user account]] in several [[MUSH]]es and [[MUCK]]s (e.g., [[PennMUSH]], TinyMUCK, [[Fuzzball MUCK]], TinyMUSH, and TinyMUX).
[[Image:Zip022707.gif|right|thumb|500px|[[Bill Griffith]]'s ''[[Zippy the Pinhead|Zippy]]'' (February 27, 2007)]]
Other odd words favored by Kurtzman and popularized by him through their use as running gags in ''Mad'' were ''[[veeblefetzer]]'', ''[[axolotl]]'', ''hoohah'', ''osszefogva'', ''bitsko'', ''furshlugginer'', ''[[Moxie]]'', ''ganef'' and ''[[halva|halavah]]''. Many of these are of [[Yiddish]] or Jewish origin.

In the [[Bill Griffith]] [[comic strip]] ''[[Zippy the Pinhead|Zippy]]'' for [[February 27]], 2007, Zippy and Zerbina mention both ''potrzebie'' and ''[[axolotl]]'' in a panel captioned, "They like to use out-of-date words and [[catchphrase]]s." The word was also featured as the title of the [[May 30]], 2018 strip and again just over three months later on [[September 8]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://comicskingdom.com/zippy-the-pinhead/2018-05-30 ''Zippy'' by Bill Griffith, Wednesday, May 30, 2018 &amp;ndash; Comics Kingdom.] Retrieved May 30, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://comicskingdom.com/zippy-the-pinhead/2018-09-08 ''Zippy'' by Bill Griffith, Saturday, September 8, 2018 &amp;ndash; Comics Kingdom.] Retrieved September 8, 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In "Agatha H. and the Clockwork Princess," the second of the novelizations of [[Phil Foglio|Phil]] and [[Kaja Foglio|Kaja]] Foglio's "[[Girl Genius]]" webcomic, the character Herr Doktor Potrezbie Spün is one of the many footnoted references.

'''Sarah Lewitinn''' (born February 3, 1980), also known by her nickname '''Ultragrrrl''', is an [[Egyptian-American]] record producer, music critic, DJ, blogger, and music director for the Canadian fashion brand, Aritzia. She began her career as an assistant [[editing|editor]] at ''[[Spin Magazine]]'', and soon helped champion rock bands like [[My Chemical Romance]] and [[The Killers]], which led to her starting her own record label, Stolen Transmission. In 2006, ''[[New York Magazine|New York]]'' magazine named Lewitinn as one of the most "influential people in music", citing that "Like it or not, she has more power than any print music critic.".&lt;ref name="Influential"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nymag.com/news/features/influentials/16905/|title=The Most Influential People in Music|publisher=New York Magazine}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Born in New York City to [[History of the Jews in Egypt|Egyptian-Jewish]] parents, Lewitinn was raised and educated in [[Tenafly, New Jersey]].&lt;ref&gt;Anderman, Jaon. [http://www.boston.com/ae/music/articles/2006/11/05/power_trio/ "Power Tri: Meet three examples of a new breed of record company talent hunter. In a downsized, downloading industry, they need more than good ears to put out great music."], ''[[The Boston Globe]]'', November 5, 2006. Accessed May 28, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; She began her career as a teenager writing for the [[AOL]]-based [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] Kidz site before interning at Spin Magazine. It was at that time she received the moniker of "Ultragrrrl", by which she continues to be known. After briefly working at the defunct [[Kurt Andersen]]-run Inside.com in 1999, Lewitinn was hired as an assistant to Michael Hirschorn at [[VH1]]. Lewitinn graduated with a degree in Advertising and Marketing from [[Fashion Institute of Technology]] in 2001.

In 2002, she was the first manager for both rock bands [[stellastarr*]] and [[My Chemical Romance]], both prior to their first major record deals. Her blog, Ultragrrrl.com (launched in July 2003), further established her as a taste-maker in the New York indie rock scene, as did her early championing of the rock band [[The Killers]] before they were signed to [[Island Def Jam]]. She returned to Spin several months later, this time as an assistant editor with her own column. In 2005, Lewitinn quit Spin to start her own record label, [[Stolen Transmission]] in partnership with Island Def Jam and [[Rob Stevenson]], the Island Def Jam [[A&amp;R]] executive responsible for signing [[The Killers]] as well as [[Fall Out Boy]], [[Thrice]], and [[The Bravery]]. Bands which were signed or had releases by Stolen Transmission include [[Oohlas|The Oohlas]], [[The Horrors]], [[Playradioplay|PlayRadioPlay!]], [[Monty Are I]], [[Permanent ME]], [[Schoolyard Heroes]], The Photo Atlas, [[Innerpartysystem]], and Bright Light Fever. Though Stolen Transmission severed its official relationship with Island Def Jam in December 2007,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://prod1.cmj.com/articles/display_article.php?id=51047542 |accessdate=May 30, 2008 }}{{dead link|date=May 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewitinn edited IDJ's parent company [[Universal Music Group]]'s short-lived website, Dance Hall.

In January 2008, Lewitinn, along with Stevenson, launched [http://forthewinmedia.com For The Win! Media], an Internet marketing company focused on promoting bands and Web sites. Clients have included [[Pet Shop Boys]], [[Lady Sovereign]], [[The Verve]] and [[The Futureheads]] as well as the film "[[Anvil! The Story of Anvil]]". However, in August 2008, Stevenson was named president of [[EMI]]'s [[Virgin records|Virgin US]] label. In November 2008, Lewitinn became a featured presenter and on-air talent for [[Fuse TV|FUSE]]'s show "Fuse On Tour" where she presents "The Ultragrrrl Report". Lewitinn left for The Win! Media in 2009 and is now a member of the Digital Strategy Team at the [[public relations]] firm [[Edelman (firm)|Edelman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://twitter.com/ultragrrrl/status/7969542748 |title=Twitter / ultragrrrl: For those asking, I'm part |publisher=Twitter.com |date=2010-01-19 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sarah provided a lot of smart counsel at Edelman but she was often criticized for throwing around the F bomb and not being "office trained"

Lewitinn is also a DJ and, along with New York-based publicist Karen Ruttner, threw a weekly party also called "Stolen Transmission" at various locations on [[Manhattan|Manhattan's]] [[Lower East Side]], including [[Pete Wentz|Pete Wentz's]] bar, Angels &amp; Kings. The Stolen Transmission party won two [[PAPER Magazine|Paper Magazine]] Nightlife Awards for People's Choice Best Party in 2005 and 2006 and Lewitinn herself won People's Choice for Best Deejay those two years as well. In October 2009, Lewitinn went on tour as the backing DJ for [[Grammy]]-nominated [[Contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] singer-songwriter [[Melanie Fiona]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://ultragrrrl.blogspot.com/2009/10/im-going-on-tour.html |title=Ultragrrrl: I'M GOING ON TOUR! |publisher=Ultragrrrl.blogspot.com |date=2009-10-18 |accessdate=2014-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewitinn also joined the 9th annual Independent Music Awards judging panel to assist independent musicians' careers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/imajudges2010.asp |title=2010 Judges |publisher=Independent Music Awards |date= |accessdate=2014-08-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111001005627/http://www.independentmusicawards.com/ima_new/imajudges2010.asp |archivedate=October 1, 2011 |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lewitinn has published two books, both released by Simon Spotlight, a division of [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]. Her first was "[https://www.amazon.com/Pocket-DJ-Sarah-Lewitinn/dp/1416907238 The Pocket DJ]", a guide to "building the best music library", divided into "Essential Genres" the best music of certain eras and genres, "Essential Artists" a list of musicians who are important to pop culture or have "a profound influence on music" including such diverse artists as [[Eminem]], [[The Beatles]], [[Nirvana (band)|Nirvana]], [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], [[Björk]] and [[Queen (band)|Queen]], "Celebrity Playlists", recommended music from DJs, musicians and others and "Other Playlists", a list of various situations with recommended songs for them, ranging from pool parties to playlists for going back to school. Her second book, "[https://www.amazon.com/Pocket-Karaoke-Sarah-Lewitinn/dp/1416950907/ Pocket Karaoke]" featured karaoke song lists, including those contributed by [[Simon LeBon]] of [[Duran Duran]] and [[Mikey Way]] of My Chemical Romance.

==In popular culture==

The character Natalie "Motorrrju" Levine from [[Marc Spitz]]'s 2006 novel ''Too Much, Too Late'', was based on Sarah "Ultragrrrl" Lewitinn.{{Citation needed|date=August 2016}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="42193">'''Social Presence Theory''' was developed by [[John Short]]{{dn|date=November 2018}} with the help of [[Ederyn Williams]], and [[Bruce Christie]]. The theory came together by the appearance of difference in the physical proximity that was produced by different mediums. &lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Psychology of Telecommunications|last=Short|first=John|last2=Williams|first2=Ederyn|last3=Christie|first3=Bruce|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|year=1976|isbn=0471015814|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;The main thesis and major points of the theory were first described in 1956 in [[The Naked Sun]], a novel by [[Isaac Asimov]]. Social Presence Theory is defined by Short, Williams &amp; Christie as the ability of a communications medium to transmit social cues. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In a study conducted by Baozhou, Weiguo and Zhou Social Presence builds trust between individuals, which is crucial to our interactions in person or online.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Baozhou|first=Lu|last2=Weighou|first2=Fan|last3=Zhou|first3=Mi|date=2015|title=Social presence, trust, and social commerce purchase intention: An empirical research.|url=https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0747563215302715|journal=Computers in Human Behavior|volume=56|pages=225-237|via=Elsevier Science Direct}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lombard &amp; Ditton &lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Lombard|first=Matthew|last2=Ditton|first2=Theresa|date=1997|title=At the Heart of It All: The Concept of Presence|url=https://academic.oup.com/jcmc/article/3/2/JCMC321/4080403|journal=Computer Mediated Communication|volume=3|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;(1997) interpreted Social Presence  Theory as a multi-dimensional and flexible concept that identifies mediums depending on how intimate, personal, warm, and sensible they are when helping form personal connections between individuals.&lt;ref name="shen3382"&gt;Shen, Yu, &amp; Khalifa 2010, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gooch2"&gt;Gooch &amp; Watts 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;Social Presence  serves as a measure for psychological processes such as social orientation, identifying motivations, and [[Groupthink|group think]]. Social Presence  Theory inspires the feeling of being together, even through a screen. The Theory explains primitive responses to social cues. &lt;ref name="shen3382" /&gt;

== Definition &amp; Emergence ==
Social Presence  Theory is defined by the different physical proximities produced by different mediums,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; the two more popular being face-to-face communication and online interaction.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Social Presence  is measured by the ability to project physical and emotional presence, and experience it from others in interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Krish 2012, p. 101-102.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="westerman"&gt; Westerman 2015, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt; Computer-mediated communication has risen in the recent years, which has forced Social Presence  Theory to be adapted to the new medium, and how we portray our persona in order to make connections with others on the internet.&lt;ref name="kehrwald"&gt;Kehrwald 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tu|first=Chih-Hsiung|date=January 2000|title=On-line learning migration: From social learning theory to social presence theory in a CMC environment|url=https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Chih_Hsiung_Tu/publication/220172861_On-line_learning_migration_From_social_learning_theory_to_social_presence_theory_in_a_CMC_environment/links/59d7cd610f7e9b12b36124d4/On-line-learning-migration-From-social-learning-theory-to-social-presence-theory-in-a-CMC-environment.pdf|journal=Network and Computer Applications|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Effective communication is measured by the parties' interpersonal involvement, while considering constraints of the communication medium used.&lt;ref name="sallnas"&gt;Sallnas, Rassmus-Grohn, &amp; Sjostrom 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

The definition of Social Presence  remains inconsistent as scholars attempt to pinpoint what the phenomenon encompasses, and how it can be adapted as new mediums of interpersonal communication arise. Social Presence  in recent years has been defined as the feeling of community a learner experiences in an online environment.&lt;ref name="Tu"&gt;Tu and McIssac, 2002&lt;/ref&gt; We have developed multiple non-verbal intimacy behaviors in the online community that develop our personal relationships with people when we communicate in a medium where there is not real life contact. &lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dixson|first=Marcia|date=2016|title=Nonverbal immediacy behaviors and online student engagement: bringing past instructional research into the present virtual classroom|url=https://www.tandfonline.com/doi/abs/10.1080/03634523.2016.1209222?journalCode=rced20|journal=Communication Education|volume=66|pages=37-53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other research has defined Social Presence as the awareness of others in an interaction combined with an appreciation of the interpersonal aspects of that interaction. &lt;ref name="short" /&gt; &lt;ref name="rice"&gt;Rice, 1993&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref name="walther"&gt; Walther 1992.&lt;/ref&gt; Gunawardena (1995) argued that Social Presence  varied in perception and was a subjective issue based upon objective qualities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gunawardena|first=C.

The definitions and interpretations of Social Presence  given by multiple sources after the original work conducted by Short, Williams and Christie have offered a clearer view that Social Presence  is more of a combination of factors that present themselves in a way so as to develop greater [[intimacy]] within a group that has a positive effect on the individual's [[affective filter]]s.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cobb|first=Susan Copley|date=2009|title=Social Presence and Online Learning: A Current View from a Research Perspective|url=https://www.ncolr.org/jiol/issues/pdf/8.3.4.pdf|journal=Journal of Interactive Online Learning|volume=8|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Several researchers have suggested that [[intimacy]] and [[immediacy (philosophy)|immediacy]] are contributing factors to Social Presence  with intimacy defined as  a measure of communication involving [[eye contact]], proximity and [[body language]] &lt;ref name="argyle"&gt; Argyle &amp; Dean 1965.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="burgeoon"&gt;Burgeoon, et al., 1984&lt;/ref&gt; and immediacy defined as the psychological distance between two parties that is conveyed through verbal and nonverbal cues in speech.&lt;ref name="walther" /&gt; 

Communicators face different challenges in order to tap into the necessities of the people they are trying to communicate with in a world that revolves around [[Multicommunicating|multicommunication]], communicators must adapt and evolve to reach audiences.&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Turner|first=J|date=2018|title=Options for the Construction of Attentional Social Presence in a Digitally Enhanced Multicommunicative Environment|url=https://academic.oup.com/ct/article/28/1/22/4944963|journal=Communication Theory|volume=28|pages=22-45|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social Presence  was originally studied in connection with face-to-face (F2F), audio, and interactive television encounters. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The emergence of computer-mediated communication (CMC) in education and training provided an entirely new series of variables and characteristics to already existing Social Presence  models. &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In e-learning context, it was redefined as learners' ability to portray themselves as "real" members of a community in social and emotional ways. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=E-learning in the 21st century: A framework for research and practice|last=Garrison|first=D.

Tu (2000,2001)&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; argued that within [[Distance education|distance learning]], Social Presence  rests upon three dimensions, [[social context]], [[online communication]], and [[interactivity]]. Social contexts contribute to a predictable degree of perceived Social Presence . Social contexts involve task orientation and privacy,&lt;ref name="steinfield"&gt;Steinfield 1986.&lt;/ref&gt; topics,&lt;ref name="argyle" /&gt; &lt;ref name="walther" /&gt; [[social relationships]], and social process. &lt;ref name="walther" /&gt; A closely related theory, [[electronic propinquity]], also examines this quality of human connection through technology.&lt;ref name="westerman" /&gt;

== Key concepts ==
Social Presence Theory, per Short, Williams and Christie in 1976,&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; is primarily composed of [[Intimacy]]&lt;ref name="argyle" /&gt; and [[Immediacy (philosophy)|Immediacy]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Language Within Language: Immediacy, a Channel in Verbal Communication|last=Wiener|first=M|last2=Mehrabain|first2=A|publisher=Ardent Media|year=1968|isbn=|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;Services, A. T. (2018, September 27). ''Social Presence Theory (PDF) .'' Retrieved from Memorial Library: &lt;nowiki&gt;https://www.mnsu.edu/its/academic/isalt_social_presence_theory.pdf&lt;/nowiki&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; [[Nonverbal communication|Non-verbal communication]] and [[Efficiency]] are two sub-terms that are relevant to the theory. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;     

=== Intimacy ===
[[Intimacy]] is defined as the feeling of closeness and belonging that two people may feel with each other.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Chapter 2. Intimacy in Law|url=http://dx.doi.org/10.1515/9781400826759.47|work=The Purchase of Intimacy|publisher=Princeton University Press|isbn=9781400826759|access-date=2018-11-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Argyle and Dean (1965) defined the interpretation of intimacy in an interaction as something that is influenced by a number of factors, such as physical distance, eye contact, smiling, body language, and potential conversation topics. We create intimacy by interpreting non-verbal cues, whether it is in person or online. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; 

=== Immediacy ===
Immediacy is defined as giving urgency or importance to an exchange. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The interpretation of immediacy was brought up by Wiener and Mehrabian in 1968 into Social Presence Theory, and it was paraphrased and further explained by Cobb as a measure of the psychological distance between the communicator and the recipient of that exchange. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The urgency we indicate when communicating with others gives them a sense of closeness and importance to their relationship. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Non-Verbal Communication ===
In an exchange participants share a multitude of additions to the verbal communication, like eye contact, posture, physical distance and facial expressions. &lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kinesics and Context|last=Birdwhistell|first=R.L.|publisher=University of Philadelphia Press|year=1970|location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt; When engaging in computer  - mediated interactions the non-verbal cues can be more ambiguous such as, emoticons, urgency of response, and personal topics within the conversation. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Efficiency ===
In Social Presence Theory, one medium may be more reliable to get the message across. The communicator is the judge when it comes to picking a medium, and getting across their message to the desired audience in the most efficient way possible. There is never a clear answer when it comes to saying what is the most efficient way. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

==Classification==
Social Presence  theory classifies different [[communication]] media along a one-dimensional continuum of ''Social Presence'' , where the degree of [[social presence|Social Presence]]  is equated to the degree of ''awareness'' of the other person in a communication interaction.&lt;ref name="sallnas" /&gt; 

Social Presence Theory in communication is effective if the communication medium has the appropriate Social Presence  required for the level of [[Interpersonal relationship|interpersonal]] [[involvement]] required in an engagement, which is one of the challenges communicators have at the time of engaging the correct [[Audience|audiences]].&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;  

On a continuum of Social Presence , the face-to-face medium is considered to have the most Social Presence , and written, text-based communication the least.&lt;ref name="biocca"&gt;Biocca, Harms, &amp; Burgoon 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; Inter-party and interpersonal exchanges are two aspects of interactions identified by Short, Williams, &amp; Christie (1976). It is assumed in Social Presence  theory that in any interaction involving two parties, both parties are concerned with acting out certain roles and developing or maintaining some sort of personal relationship.&lt;ref name="short"&gt;Short, John, Ederyn Williams, and Bruce Christie 1976.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Face - to - Face interactions ===
The most basic of interactions are done face-to-face, and the participants exchange, in addition to verbal communication, a set of non-verbal cues just as facial expression, direction of gaze, posture, dress, and body language. &lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Social Psychology of Telecommunications|last=Short|first=John|last2=Williams|first2=Ederyn|last3=Christie|first3=Bruce|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Ltd|year=1976|isbn=0471015814|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the work about [[Kinesics]] done by [[Ray Birdwhistell|Birdwhistell]] in 1970&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Kinesics and Context|last=Birdwhistell|first=R.L.|publisher=University of Philadelphia Press|year=1970|location=Philadelphia}}&lt;/ref&gt; there were two types of functions identified for non-verbal cues. &lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; One of the functions is directly related to the message that is being sent between one individual to another, and the is concerned withe the communication process and the integrational aspects. &lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The integrational activity includes the behavior that keeps the interaction in process, and the comprehensibility that goes in the exchange between individuals. Argyle in 1969, identified six functions of six non-verbal cues and what role they play in the communications process. &lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Interaction|last=Argyle|first=M|publisher=Methuen|year=1969|location=London|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are three that are integrational and three that are informational. &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

The integrational functions&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; are: 

# Mutual attention and responsiveness: eye-gaze, head nods and gestures. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
# Channel control: head nods and eye movements. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Argyle|first=M|last2=Lalljee|first2=M|last3=Cook|first3=M|date=1968|title=The effects of visibility on interaction in the dyad|journal=Human Relations|volume=21|pages=3-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;
#[[Feedback]]: This is mainly for the speaker to know how the audience is receiving the message. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The informational functions&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt; are: 

#[[Illustration|Illustrations]]: Hand functions to paint a picture or an object. &lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
#[[Emblem|Emblems]]: Gestures being used instead of a word, like moving your head up and dow to say "yes."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;
# Interpersonal attitudes: eye-gaze, gestures, proximity and facial expressions. &lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;

# 

=== Computer-Mediated interactions ===
As [[computer-mediated communication]] has evolved a more relational view of Social Presence  has emerged. Social Presence  has come to be viewed as the way individuals represent themselves in their online environment. &lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; It's a personal stamp that indicates that the individual is available and willing to engage and connect with other persons in their online community. Social Presence  is demonstrated by the way messages are posted and how those messages are interpreted by others. &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;Social Presence  defines how participants relate to one another which in turn affects their ability to communicate effectively.&lt;ref name="kehrwald" /&gt;

Social Presence  theory provides a foundation for communication systems designers and serves as a main principle in [[computer-mediated communication]] studies.&lt;ref name="shen338"&gt; Shen, Yu, &amp; Khalifa 2010, p. 338&lt;/ref&gt; Aragon (2003), Gorham &amp; Cristophel (1990), and Tu &amp; McIsaac (2002) place high importance on using engagement tactics in online classrooms geared towards increasing Social Presence  and reducing distance (Kendall &amp; Kendall, 2017). These tactics include ways to humanize the interactions between instructor and students.&lt;ref name="kendall"&gt;Kendall &amp; Kendall 2017, p. 64.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Asynchronous learning|Asynchronous]] (pre-produced content accessed individually by students on the web) and [[Synchronization|synchronous]] (real-time, simultaneous live connections of students together) components combined can enliven online interactions. &lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;Depending on the technology used, synchronous sessions can provide both audio and video connection, allowing an interchange involving both sight and sound, and all the rich nonverbal communication inherent in tone of voice and facial expression.

Accepted as a major design principle, designers have used Social Presence Theory to gain insight into user behavior when developing web-based applications and social computing technologies.&lt;ref name="shen339"&gt;Shen, Yu, &amp; Khalifa 2010, p. 339.&lt;/ref&gt; They use social communication tools to enhance the student experience and to overcome the challenges of forming interpersonal relationships in a virtual space.&lt;ref name="kilic764"&gt;Kilic Cakmak, Cebi, &amp; Kan 2014, p. 764&lt;/ref&gt; Designers seek to provide a high-quality experience for the users by encouraging meaningful interactions between users and the development of interpersonal relationships.&lt;ref name="shen339" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Osei-Frimpong|first=K|last2=McLean|first2=G|date=March 2018|title=Examining online social brand engagement: A social presence theory perspective.|url=|journal=Technological Forecasting and Social Change|volume=128|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a study conducted by Jahng and Littau in 2016&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt; the importance we give to computer mediated communications in order to trust the people we communicate with is reinforced. Their study describes how important it is for Journalists to be present and active on Social media in order to create a bond of trust with their audiences. Individuals do not feel comfortable when professionals are not as active on social platforms as it has been established to be the norm. &lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

Research related to the importance of Social Presence  in the success of students points to the need to design social communication tools to enhance users’ experience of one another.&lt;ref name="kilic765"&gt;Kilic Cakmak, Cebi, &amp; Kan 2014, p. 765.&lt;/ref&gt;  Social Presence  affects different aspects of a learner’s experience such as, their "success (Russo &amp; Benson, 2005; Zhan &amp; Mei, 2013), satisfaction (Gunawardena &amp; Zittle, 1997; Richardson &amp; Swan, 2003; So &amp; Brush, 2008; Zhan &amp; Mei, 2013), and performance (Lomicka &amp; Lord, 2007; Richardson &amp; Swan, 2003)."&lt;ref name="kilic764" /&gt; A positive Social Presence  enables students to engage on another with ease while a negative Social Presence  has been shown to increase disappointment in users which decreases [[cognition]] and familiarity with the material.&lt;ref name="kilic"&gt;Kilic Cakmak, Cebi, &amp; Kan 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Without Social Presence  learning interaction suffers, which has negative effects on learning performance.&lt;ref name="wei"&gt;Wei, Chen, &amp; Kinshuk 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Significance==
Social Presence  is critical in improving instructional effectiveness in any setting especially in distance education. Tu (2000,2001) argued that within distance learning, Social Presence  rests on three dimensions: social context, online communication, and interactivity. Social contexts contribute to a predictable degree of perceived Social Presence . Social contexts involve task orientation, privacy, topics, social relationships, and social process.&lt;ref name="steinfield" /&gt;&lt;ref name="argyle" /&gt;&lt;ref name="walther" /&gt; As an example, when a conversation is task-based and public without a sense of community being in place, the perception of Social Presence  is low and affective filter (a communication blockage brought about by negative emotional feelings) is high. In addition, Social Presence  research sheds light on the relationship between a shared learning space and participants' satisfaction and encourages to build up a shared learning space for a better e-learning environment. &lt;ref&gt;Johnson, R. D., Hornik, S., &amp; Salas, E. (2008). An empirical examination of factors contributing to the creation of successful e-learning environments. ''International Journal of Human-Computer Studies,66''(5), 356-369. &lt;/ref&gt;

More recently Social Presence  has been used as a concept in exploring interpersonal communication suggesting a direct association between Social Presence  with feelings of closeness.&lt;ref name="gooch"&gt;Gooch &amp; Watts 2015.&lt;/ref&gt; Recent research highlights the importance of Social Presence in educational settings when delivering feedback on marked assessments.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = Assignments 2.0: The role of social presence and computer attitudes in student preferences for online versus offline marking|url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1096751615000457|journal = The Internet and Higher Education|date = 2016-01-01|pages = 8–16|volume = 28|doi = 10.1016/j.iheduc.2015.08.002|first = Rachel|last = Grieve|first2 = Christine R.|last2 = Padgett|first3 = Robyn L.|last3 = Moffitt}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Measurement ==
There hasn't been a general agreement on how to measure Social Presence Theory, but there are three major instruments that can be used to have a better understanding of the Theory. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  

* The Social Presence Scale was developed by  [[Gunawardena]] and Zittle in 1997. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; The test measures [[immediacy (philosophy)|immediacy]], which is one of the two main components of this theory. This measurement has been proven reliable and it is continually used in research. &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;    
* The Social Presence and Privacy Questionnaire was developed by Tu in 2002. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; This measurement has been developed on three different dimensions: [[social context]], [[Computer-mediated communication|online communication]], [[interactivity]]. The test contains 17 social presence items and 13 privacy items rated on a five point rating scale. &lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  
* Self-Reporting Social Presence Scale, was developed by Krejins, Kirschner, Jochems and Buuren in 2011. It is a scale that consists on five items with an internal consistency.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;  

==Conclusion==
Steinfield (1986) found that task [[complexity]], [[interdependence]], [[uncertainty]], and the perceived need to communicate over distances were positively associated with increasing [[online communication]]. Walther (1992) argued that social relationships could stimulate changes in discourse as well. In examining text-based CMC (e-mails) of conference participants, Walther discovered participants formed impressions of other participants from their communications. These impressions developed into visual interpretations of the other, and a sense of intimacy and identification between participants, which led to greater perceptions of Social Presence .

Gunawardena (1991) argued that a purely text-based communication system (e-mail, discussion boards and chat) rests upon the assumption that people using such a system have already developed a level of comfort with the technology that allow the person to effectively use it. Gunawardena argued further that text-based communications should account for not all users having a level of comfort in its use. Courses or conferences that will rely heavily on such a system for communication should begin with light and casual conversation in areas that the user has a lot of familiarity and can devote more resources to gaining a comfort level with the technology.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Later work by Palloff and Pratt (1999, 2003) validated Gunawardena's recommendation in their call for establishing learning communities among online users at the very beginning of courses. In doing so, Palloff and Pratt argue that affective filters are lowered. 

Interactivity involves the activities and communication styles online users engage in. Norton (1986) identified eleven communication styles that can be associated with online communications: impression-leaving, contentious, open, dramatic, dominant, precise, relaxed, friendly, attentive, animated, and image. What style participants use in communicating, especially the style teachers use, will impact Social Presence .&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

In their 2002 study on Social Presence , Tu and McIssac declared, "Social Presence  positively influences online instruction; however, frequency of participation does not represent high Social Presence ." In both a quantitative and qualitative analysis of 51 volunteers' interactions, Tu and McIssac found that social context was more qualitative (a learned skill set rather than a prescriptive set of actions) to achieve positive impact, online communication was more strongly related to quantifiable and organizational skills of participants, and that interactivity was a combination of skill sets and communication styles used in combination. As a result, Tu and McIssac identified the following variables that had strong positive effects on the fueling or perception of Social Presence .

While research in Social Presence  is ongoing, researchers are confidently recommending designing online and e-format courses for its presence along the three dimensions we have discussed. By building trust online, providing social "hand holding" support up front in any course using CMC and promoting informal relationships, teachers and instructors can provide a strong sense of Social Presence , increase sense of community, and in turn increase interaction among participants.

[[File:Moreau Voltaire Sophonisbe.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Michel Moreau]]: Illustration of Sophonisbe 1786]]
'' '''Sophonisbe''' '' is a tragedy in five acts by [[Voltaire]]. The play, printed in 1769 but dated 1770, was a stage failure when it premiered in 15 January 1774.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=age:Voltaire - Œuvres complètes Garnier tome7.djvu/45 |url=https://fr.wikisource.org/wiki/Page:Voltaire_-_%C5%92uvres_compl%C3%A8tes_Garnier_tome7.djvu/45 |website=fr.wikisource.org |publisher=Wikisource |accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
==Action==
The action takes places in a hall of the palace of [[Cirta]] at the time if the [[Second Punic War]]. [[Sophonisbe]], daughter of Asdrubal ([[Hasdrubal Gisco|Hasdrubal]]) is married to king Siphax ([[Syphax]]) of [[Numidia]]. Her former fiancé Massinisse ([[Massinissa]]) defeats and kills Siphax with the help of the Romans and wants to marry Sophonisbe; Scipion ([[Publius Cornelius Scipio Africanus]]) however wants her sent to Rome. Massinisse therefore kills both Sophonisbe and himself.&lt;ref name="DeTemple"&gt;Vgl. Siegfried Detemple: ''Sophonisbe'', in: ''Voltaire: Die Werke. Katalog zum 300. Geburtstag.'' Reichert, Wiesbaden 1994, pp.220f.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Literary sources==
The material for the plot derives from accounts by [[Titus Livius]], [[Polybius]] and [[Appian]], which had already been adapted into stage plays by a number of writers including [[Gian Giorgio Trissino]] (1514), [[Jean Mairet]] (1629), [[Pierre Corneille]] (1663) and [[Nathaniel Lee]] (1675). Analysis of the dramatic structure and the verse indicates that Voltaire drew on a number of earlier version of the story while crafting his own.&lt;ref name="Genesis"/&gt;

==Contemporary reception==
Voltaire succeeded in having the play premiered at the [[Comédie-Française]] in 15 January 1774 but there were only four performances before it was taken off the stage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Hageman |first=Marjolein  |date=2010 |title=La Réception du théâtre de Voltaire dans les Provinces-Unies au XVIIIème siècle
 |type=PhD |page=161 |publisher=Universiteit Leiden |url=https://openaccess.leidenuniv.nl/bitstream/handle/1887/15946/Th%E8se+compl%E8te+Leyde+revue+bis.pdf;jsessionid=092158515F6361A077A8031CFE59043C?sequence=4 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The failure of both this and his other play ''[[Don Pèdre, roi de Castille]]'' depressed him, and he took a break from writing tragedies until 1777, when he wrote ''[[Irène (tragedy)|Irène]]'' and ''[[Agathocle]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Theodore Besterman]]: Exil (1773–1775), in: Voltaire, Winkler, München, 1971, p.441&lt;/ref&gt;

==Printed edition==
Voltaire had arranged the printing of the work in late 1769 with the widow Duchesne in Paris. Publication followed at the end of that year, carrying the date 1770. The work was published with the title ''Sophonisbe, Tragédie de Mairet, reparée à neuf'', Veuve Duchesne, Paris, 1770.&lt;ref name="DeTemple"/&gt; Voltaire added an explanatory preface in which he claimed that Mairet's work had been adapted by a certain Jean-Baptiste Lantin, who had died fifty years previously, but this is certainly spurious.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Bengesco |first1=Georges |title=Voltaire: Bibliographie de ses Oeuvres |date=1882 |publisher=Rouveyre et G. Blond |location=Paris |page=77 |url=https://doc.rero.ch/record/10675/files/Bibliographie_Voltaire_Bengesco_volume1.pdf |accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It may be that Voltaire was uncertain about how the theatre-going public would respond to the play, and wished to distance himself to some degree from his own creation.&lt;ref name="Genesis"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Malone Feige |first1=Camilla |title=Genesis and sources of Voltaire's "Sophonisbe" |url=http://digitallibrary.usc.edu/cdm/ref/collection/p15799coll39/id/281023|website=digitallibrary.usc.edu |publisher=USC Digital Library |accessdate=1 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Spider-Man 2''''' is a 2004 American [[superhero film]] directed by [[Sam Raimi]] and written by [[Alvin Sargent]] from a story by [[Alfred Gough]], [[Miles Millar]] and [[Michael Chabon]]. A sequel to the 2002 film ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'', it is the second installment in the [[Spider-Man in film#Sam Raimi films|''Spider-Man'' trilogy]] based on the fictional [[Marvel Comics]] character of [[Spider-Man|the same name]]. [[Tobey Maguire]], [[Kirsten Dunst]], [[James Franco]], [[Rosemary Harris]], and [[J. K. Simmons]] reprise their respective roles as [[Spider-Man|Peter Parker / Spider-Man]], [[Mary Jane Watson]], [[Harry Osborn]], [[Aunt May]], and [[J. Jonah Jameson]], while [[Alfred Molina]] and [[Donna Murphy]] join the cast as [[Doctor Octopus|Otto Octavius / Doctor Octopus]] and Rosalie Octavius.

Set two years after the events of ''Spider-Man'', the film finds Peter Parker struggling to manage both his personal life and his duties as Spider-Man, while Dr. Otto Octavius becomes a diabolical villain after a failed experiment kills his wife and leaves him neurologically fused to mechanical tentacles. Spider-Man must stop him from successfully recreating the experiment, which threatens to destroy the city, while dealing with a subconscious desire to stop being Spider-Man that is stripping him of his powers.

[[Principal photography]] began in April 2003 in [[New York City]] and also took place in [[Los Angeles]]. ''Spider-Man 2'' was released in both conventional and [[IMAX]] theaters on June 30, 2004 and grossed $783&amp;nbsp;million worldwide, becoming the [[2004 in film#Highest-grossing films|third highest-grossing film of the year]]. It won the [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects]] and was also nominated for [[Academy Award for Best Sound|Best Sound Mixing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]]; it also received five awards at the [[Saturn Award]]s, including [[Saturn Award for Best Fantasy Film|Best Fantasy Film]] and [[Saturn Award for Best Director|Best Director]] for Raimi. It is considered as one of the most influential and one of the [[List of films considered the greatest#Comic%2FSuperhero|best superhero films of all-time]]&lt;ref name="Den of Geek"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.denofgeek.us/movies/best-and-worst-superhero-movies/22448/top-10-best-and-worst-superhero-movies|title=Top 10 Best and Worst Superhero Movies |publisher=[[Den of Geek]]|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Street"&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.thestreet.com/story/12736276/2/the-10-greatest-superhero-movies-of-all-time.html|title=The 10 Greatest Superhero Movies of All Time |publisher=[[TheStreet.com|The Street]]|accessdate=September 15, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.rollingstone.com/movies/pictures/readers-poll-the-15-greatest-superhero-movies-20140409/|title=Readers' Poll: The 15 Greatest Superhero Movies|publisher=''[[Rolling Stone]]''|via=|accessdate=June 13, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mrqe.com/lists/comic-adaptations/cinemas-best-comic-book-adaptations|title=MRQE's Best of Comics &amp; Superheroes |publisher=Mrqe.com |accessdate=4 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://editorial.rottentomatoes.com/guide/50-best-superhero-movies-of-all-time/5/|title=50 Best Superhero Movies of All Time|publisher=Rotten Tomatoes}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Its success led to ''[[Spider-Man 3]]'' (2007).

==Plot==
&lt;!--Per WP:FILMPLOT, plot summaries for featured film articles should be between 400-700 words.--&gt;

[[Spider-Man|Peter Parker]], secretly the superhero Spider-Man, is estranged from both love interest [[Mary Jane Watson]] and best friend [[Harry Osborn]], and additionally discovers his [[Aunt May]] is facing eviction. He also finds himself suffering temporary, but reoccurring losses of his powers, often in life-threatening situations.

Harry, now head of [[Oscorp]]'s genetic and scientific research division, is sponsoring a [[fusion power]] project by nuclear scientist Otto Octavius, who befriends and mentors Peter. While handling hazardous materials, Octavius wears a harness of powerful [[robotic arm|robotic tentacle arms]] with [[artificial intelligence]]. During a public demonstration that Peter and Harry attend, a power spike causes the fusion reactor to destabilize. Octavius refuses to shut down the reactor, which goes critical — killing his wife and burning the inhibitor chip blocking the arms from his nervous system. Peter shuts the experiment down, destroying it in the process.

At a hospital, doctors prepare to surgically remove Octavius' harness. However, without the inhibitor chip the arms have developed sentience and attack them. Upon regaining consciousness and seeing the carnage, Octavius escapes and takes refuge at a harbor. Becoming increasingly influenced by the arms' AI, he robs a bank in order to fund a second experiment. Peter and May coincidentally are there, and   Octavius takes May hostage. Peter rescues her, but Octavius flees with stolen money. The ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' subsequently dubs the scientist [[Doctor Octopus]].

Mary Jane becomes engaged to [[astronaut]] [[John Jameson (comics)|John Jameson]], son of ''Bugle'' publisher [[J. Jonah Jameson]]. Peter suffers an emotional breakdown over his inability to balance his life, resulting in him losing his powers. He abandons his Spider-Man identity, returns to his normal life, and attempts to reconcile with Mary Jane. A garbageman brings Peter's Spider-Man costume to Jameson, who takes credit for driving Spider-Man into hiding. Peter tells May the truth behind his [[Uncle Ben]]'s death and how he is responsible. May forgives him, but the rise in [[New York City]] crime rates worries Peter.

Requiring the isotope [[tritium]] to fuel his reactor, Octavius visits Harry to demand it. Harry agrees in exchange for Spider-Man, whom he believes is responsible for the death of his father [[Norman Osborn]]. He tells Octavius to seek Peter, who Harry believes is friends with Spider-Man, but tells Octavius not to harm him. Octavius locates Peter, tells him to find Spider-Man, and captures Mary Jane. Her endangerment leads to Peter's powers resurfacing. Just as Jameson admits he was wrong about Spider-Man, Peter steals his costume back from the ''Bugle'' and goes after Octavius.

As Peter battles Octavius, they fall onto a [[New York City Subway]] train. Octavius sabotages the controls and leaves Peter to save the passengers, which he does at a great physical toll. When he faints from exhaustion, the grateful passengers save him from falling and bring him into the train, seeing his unmasked face but promising to keep their knowledge hidden. In vain, they try to protect him when Octavius returns to capture Peter, whom Octavius delivers to Harry.

After giving Octavius the tritium, Harry prepares to kill Spider-Man, only to be shocked to see Peter under the mask. Peter convinces Harry to direct him to Octavius' lair, as bigger things are at stake. As Spider-Man, he arrives at the doctor's waterfront laboratory and attempts to rescue Mary Jane discreetly. Octavius discovers him and they fight once again as the nuclear reaction swells. Peter ultimately subdues Octavius, reveals his identity, and persuades Octavius to let his dream go for the greater good. Octavius finally commands the tentacles to obey him, and gives his life to destroy the experiment. Mary Jane sees Spider-Man's true identity and feelings, which he says is why they cannot be together. Peter returns Mary Jane to John, and leaves.

Harry is visited by a vision of his father in a mirror, pleading for Harry to avenge his death. Refusing to hurt Peter, Harry shatters the mirror, unintentionally revealing a secret room containing prototypes of the [[Green Goblin]]'s equipment. On her wedding day, Mary Jane abandons John at the altar and runs to Peter's apartment. After they kiss, they hear police sirens, and Mary Jane encourages him go help as Spider-Man.

Immediately after finishing ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'', director [[Sam Raimi]] with help from James Keltie segued into directing a sequel.&lt;ref name="amazing"&gt;{{cite video|title=Making the Amazing |medium=DVD |publisher=[[Sony]]|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2002, Sony hired [[Alfred Gough]] and [[Miles Millar]] to write a script with [[Doctor Octopus]], [[Lizard (comics)|the Lizard]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slashfilm.com/concept-art-canceled-pixar-movie-newt-and-sam-raimis-abandoned-lizard-designs-from-spider-man-2/&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Black Cat (Marvel Comics)|Black Cat]] as the villains.&lt;ref name="greg"&gt;{{cite web|authorlink=Greg Dean Schmitz|first=Greg Dean |last=Schmitz |title= Greg's Preview – Spider-Man 2|publisher=Yahoo!|url=https://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hp&amp;cf=prev&amp;id=1808417249&amp;gpt=ch|accessdate=April 15, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20061225161307/http://movies.yahoo.com/shop?d=hp&amp;cf=prev&amp;id=1808417249&amp;gpt=ch|archivedate=December 25, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; On May 8, 2002, following ''[[Spider-Man (2002 film)|Spider-Man]]'''s record breaking $115&amp;nbsp;million opening weekend, [[Sony Pictures]] announced a sequel for 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Spider-Man sequel set for 2004|publisher=BBC|date=May 8, 2002 |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment/film/1974457.stm|accessdate=March 25, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Entitled ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'', after the character's main comic book title,&lt;ref name="spidey's back"&gt;{{cite news |first=Chris |last=Hewitt|title=Spidey's Back|work=[[Empire (magazine)|Empire]]|pages=79–90|date=June 25, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; the film was given a budget of $200&amp;nbsp;million&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/arts/fridayreview/story/0,12102,1235533,00.html|title=Spider-Man 2 Budget|publisher=Guardian.com|date=April 30, 2002|accessdate=November 7, 2006|location=London|first=Archie|last=Thomas}}&lt;/ref&gt; and aimed for a release date of May 7, 2004. The following month, [[David Koepp]] was added to co-write with Gough and Millar.&lt;ref name="greg"/&gt;

In September 2002, [[Michael Chabon]] was hired to rewrite.&lt;ref name="greg"/&gt; His draft had a younger Doc Ock, who becomes infatuated with Mary Jane. His mechanical limbs use [[endorphin]]s to counteract the pain of being attached to his body, which he enjoys. When he injures two muggers on a date, this horrifies Mary Jane and in the resulting battle with Spider-Man his tentacles are fused together, and the fusion begins to kill him. In the script, Octavius is the creator of the genetically-altered spider from the first film, and gives Peter an antidote to remove his powers: this means when Octavius is dying with his tentacles, he wants to extract Spider-Man's spine to save himself. This leads to the alliance with Harry in the final film. Beforehand, Harry and the ''[[Daily Bugle]]'' put a $10&amp;nbsp;million price on Spider-Man's head, causing the city's citizens to turn against him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Jeff |last=Vandermeer|title=Read Michael Chabon's Script for Spider-Man 2|publisher=io9|date=April 14, 2008|url=http://io9.com/379291/read-michael-chabons-script-for-spider+man-2|accessdate=April 14, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer [[Avi Arad]] rejected the [[love triangle]] angle on Ock, and found Harry putting a price on Spider-Man's head unsubtle.&lt;ref name="amazing"/&gt;

Raimi sifted through the previous drafts by Gough, Millar, Koepp and Chabon, picking what he liked with screenwriter [[Alvin Sargent]].&lt;ref name="raimi beeb"&gt;{{cite news|first=Stella |last=Papamichael|title=Sam Raimi|publisher=BBC|date=July 9, 2004|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/films/2004/07/09/sam_raimi_spiderman_2_interview.shtml|accessdate=April 30, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He felt that thematically the film had to explore Peter's conflict with his personal wants against his responsibility, exploring the positive and negatives of his chosen path, and how he ultimately decides that he can be happy as a heroic figure.&lt;ref name="amazing"/&gt; Raimi stated the story was partly influenced by ''[[Superman II]]'', which also explored the titular hero giving up his responsibilities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Brian|last= Cronin|title=Guest Spot: Rohan Williams Interviews Sam Raimi and Rob Tapert (Part 1)|publisher=[[Comic Book Resources]]|date=November 28, 2007|url=http://goodcomics.comicbookresources.com/2007/11/28/guest-spot-rohan-williams-interviews-sam-raimi-and-rob-tapert-part-1/|accessdate=November 28, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The story is mainly taken from ''[[The Amazing Spider-Man]]'' No. 50, "Spider-Man No More!" It was decided that Doctor Octopus would be kept as the villain, as he was both a visually interesting villain who was a physical match for Spider-Man, and a sympathetic figure with humanity, accompanied by the fact that the character had been repeatedly considered as a villain for the first film over the course of its 15-year development.&lt;ref name="amazing"/&gt; Raimi changed much of the character's backstory, however, adding the idea of Otto Octavius being a hero of Peter, and how their conflict was about trying to rescue him from his demons rather than kill him.&lt;ref name="spidey's back"/&gt;

===Filming===
[[File:Spydercam.jpg|thumb|The Spydercam]]
''Spider-Man 2'' was shot on over one hundred sets and locations, beginning with a pre-shoot on [[The Loop (rapid transit)|the Loop]] in Chicago during two days in November 2002. The crew acquired a train of [[2200 series (CTA)|2200 series]] cars, placing sixteen cameras for background shots of Spider-Man and Doc Ock's train fight.&lt;ref name="amazing"/&gt; [[Principal photography]] began on April 12, 2003 in New York City. The crew moved on May 13 to Los Angeles,&lt;ref name="greg"/&gt; shooting on ten major sets created by production designer Neil Spisak. After the scare surrounding his back pains, [[Tobey Maguire]] relished performing many of his stunts, even creating a joke of it with Raimi, creating the line "My back, my back" as Spider-Man tries to regain his powers.&lt;ref name="raimi beeb"/&gt; Even [[Rosemary Harris]] took a turn, putting her stunt double out of work. In contrast, [[Alfred Molina]] joked that the stunt team would "trick" him into performing a stunt time and again.&lt;ref name="amazing"/&gt;
[[File:NY-Spiderman.JPG|thumb|left|Frame of an old burnt-out New York Central Railroad dock on the west side of Manhattan, which was used for the film.]]
Filming was put on hiatus for eight weeks, in order to build Doc Ock's pier lair. It had been Spisak's idea to use a collapsed pier as Ock's lair, reflecting an exploded version of the previous lab and representing how Octavius' life had collapsed and grown more monstrous,&lt;ref name="amazing"/&gt; evoking the cinema of [[Fritz Lang]] and the film ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom |last=Russo|title=A Bug's Life|work=[[Premiere (magazine)|Premiere]]|url=http://www.premiere.com/movienews/1704/a-bugs-life.html|accessdate=May 6, 2007|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071102191140/http://www.premiere.com/movienews/1704/a-bugs-life.html &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate=November 2, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; Filming then resumed on that set, having taken fifteen weeks to build, occupying Sony's Stage 30. It was {{convert|60|ft|m}} by {{convert|120|ft|m}} long, and {{convert|40|ft|m}} high, and a quarter-scale miniature was also built for the finale as it collapses.&lt;ref name="amazing"/&gt; Filming was still going after Christmas 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Patrick|last=Sauriol|title=Scoop: Spider-Man 2 reshoots this week?|publisher=Mania Movies|date=December 28, 2003|url=http://www.mania.com/40497.html|accessdate=May 3, 2007|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929090545/http://www.mania.com/40497.html|archivedate=September 29, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[camera system]] called the [[Spydercam]] was used to allow filmmakers to express more of Spider-Man's world view, at times dropping fifty stories and with shot lengths of just over {{convert|2400|ft|m}} in New York or {{convert|3200|ft|m}} in Los Angeles. For some shots the camera would shoot at six frames per second for a faster playback increasing the sense of speed. Shots using the Spydercam were pre-planned in digital versions of cities, and the camera's movement was controlled with motion control, making it highly cost-effective. The camera system was only used in the previous film for the final shot.&lt;ref name="amazing"/&gt;

===Visual effects===
Although roughly the same, costume designer [[James Acheson]] made numerous subtle changes to Spider-Man's costume. The colors were made richer and bolder, the spider emblem was given more elegant lines and enlarged, the eye-lenses were somewhat smaller, and the muscle suit underneath was made into pieces, to give a better sense of movement. The helmet Maguire wore under his mask was also improved, with better movement for the false jaw and magnetic eye pieces, which were easier to remove.&lt;ref name="amazing"/&gt;

To create [[Doctor Octopus]]' mechanical tentacles, Edge FX was hired to create a corset, a metal and rubber girdle, a rubber spine and four foam rubber tentacles which were {{convert|8|ft|m}} long, which altogether weighed {{convert|100|lb|kg}}. The claws of each tentacle, which were dubbed "death flowers", were controlled by a single puppeteer in a chair. Each tentacle was controlled by four people, who rehearsed every scene with Molina to give a natural sense of movement as if the tentacles were moving due to Octavius' muscle movement.&lt;ref name="eight"/&gt; On-set, Molina christened his co-stars "Larry", "Harry", "Moe" and "Flo", with "Flo" being the top-right tentacle.&lt;ref name="wizard"&gt;Mike Cotton. "Spider-Man 3." ''[[Wizard (magazine)|Wizard: The Comics Magazine]]'' June 2007: p. 30–31.&lt;/ref&gt;

Edge FX was only hired to do scenes where Octavius carries his tentacles. CGI was used for when the tentacles carry Octavius: a {{convert|20|ft|m|abbr=on}} high rig held Molina to glide through his surroundings, with CG tentacles added later.&lt;ref name="eight"&gt;{{cite video|title=Eight Arms To Hold You|medium=DVD|publisher=Sony|year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The CG versions were scanned straight from the practical ones.&lt;ref name="amazing"/&gt; However, using the practical versions was always preferred to save money,&lt;ref name="eight"/&gt; and each scene was always filmed first with Edge FX's creations to see if CGI was truly necessary. Completing the illusion, the sound designers chose not to use servo sound effects, feeling it would rob the tentacles of the sense that they were part of Octavius' body, and instead used motorcycle chains and piano wires.&lt;ref name="amazing"/&gt;

''[[Chicago Tribune]]''{{'s}} Mark Caro stated that Alfred Molina was a "pleasingly complex" villain, and the film as a whole "improves upon its predecessor in almost every way."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mark |last=Caro |url=http://metromix.chicagotribune.com/movies/mmx-040628-moviespiderman2,0,7449342.story |title=Caro reviews ''Spider-Man 2'' |work=Chicago Tribune |date=June 28, 2004 |accessdate=May 29, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060828213024/http://metromix.chicagotribune.com/movies/mmx-040628-moviespiderman2,0,7449342.story |archivedate=August 28, 2006 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Kenneth Turan]], of the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', gave the film 4 out of 5 stars, and concurred with Caro when he stated, "Doc Ock grabs this film with his quartet of sinisterly serpentine mechanical arms and refuses to let go."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Kenneth |last=Turan |url=http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-turan29jun29,2,5508627.story?coll=cl-mreview |title=Turan reviews ''Spider-Man 2'' |work=Los Angeles Times |date=June 29, 2004 |accessdate=May 29, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070929083206/http://www.calendarlive.com/movies/reviews/cl-et-turan29jun29%2C2%2C5508627.story?coll=cl-mreview |archivedate=September 29, 2007 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]], who had given the first film two and a half stars, gave ''Spider-Man 2'' a perfect four out of four stars, calling it "The best superhero movie since the modern genre was launched with ''[[Superman (1978 film)|Superman]]'' (1978)", and praising the film for "effortlessly [combining] special effects and a human story, keeping its parallel plots alive and moving."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=Roger Ebert|first=Roger|last=Ebert|url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20040629/REVIEWS/406300301/1023|title=Ebert reviews ''Spider-Man 2''|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=June 30, 2004|accessdate=May 29, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; He later called it the fourth best film of 2004."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Ebert's 10 Best Lists 1967–Present |work=Chicago Sun-Times |date=December 15, 2004 |accessdate=July 12, 2008 |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/20041215/COMMENTARY/41215001/1023 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060908200137/http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=%2F20041215%2FCOMMENTARY%2F41215001%2F1023 |archivedate=September 8, 2006 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[IGN]]'s Richard George felt "Sam Raimi and his writing team delivered an iconic, compelling version of Spider-Man's classic foe...

Conversely, [[J. Hoberman]], of ''[[The Village Voice]]'', thought the first half of the film was "talky bordering on tiresome", with the film often stopping to showcase Raimi's idea of humor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|authorlink=J.

[[File:Budweiser Clydesdales Boston.jpg|thumb|200px|The [[Budweiser Clydesdales]], mascots of the U.S. beer brand [[Budweiser]]; its parent company [[Anheuser-Busch]] frequently advertises during the Super Bowl, and have won ''[[USA Today]]''{{'}}s [[Super Bowl Ad Meter|annual Super Bowl ad survey]] 14 times in its history.&lt;ref name=usatoday-admeter2014/&gt;&lt;ref name=usatoday-bud2013/&gt;]]
The U.S. television broadcast of the [[Super Bowl]] – the championship game of the [[National Football League]] (NFL) – features many high-profile [[television advertisement|television commercials]], colloquially known as '''Super Bowl ads'''. The phenomenon is a result of the game's extremely high viewership and wide demographics: Super Bowl games have frequently been among the United States' [[List of most watched television broadcasts in the United States|most watched television broadcasts]], with [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]] having estimated that [[Super Bowl XLIX]] in 2015 was seen by at least 114.4 million viewers in the United States, surpassing [[Super Bowl XLVIII|the previous year's Super Bowl]] as the highest-rated television broadcast in U.S. history. As such, advertisers have typically used commercials during the Super Bowl as a means of building awareness for their products and services among this wide audience, while also trying to generate [[Marketing buzz|buzz]] around the ads themselves so they may receive additional exposure, such as becoming a [[viral video]].

Super Bowl commercials have become a cultural phenomenon of their own alongside the game itself; many viewers only watch the game to see the commercials,&lt;ref name="forbes-4m"&gt;{{Cite web | url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2014/01/29/yes-a-super-bowl-ad-really-is-worth-4-million/ | title=Yes, A Super Bowl Ad Really Is Worth $4 Million | work=[[Forbes.com]] | date=January 29, 2014 | access-date=September 15, 2017 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171002055356/https://www.forbes.com/sites/onmarketing/2014/01/29/yes-a-super-bowl-ad-really-is-worth-4-million/ | archive-date=October 2, 2017 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; national surveys (such as the ''[[USA Today]]'' [[Super Bowl Ad Meter]]) judge which advertisement carried the best viewer response, and [[CBS]] has aired yearly specials since 2000 chronicling notable commercials from the game. Super Bowl advertisements have become iconic and well-known because of their [[Cinematography|cinematographic]] quality, unpredictability, surreal humor, and use of special effects. The use of celebrity cameos has also been common in Super Bowl ads. A number of major brands, including [[Budweiser]], [[Coca-Cola]], [[Doritos]], [[GoDaddy]] and [[Master Lock]], have been well known for making repeated appearances during the Super Bowl.

The prominence of airing a commercial during the Super Bowl has also carried an increasingly high price: the average cost of a 30-second commercial during the Super Bowl has ranged from $37,500 at [[Super Bowl I]], to around $2.2 million at [[Super Bowl XXXIV]] in 2000, and by [[Super Bowl XLIX]] in 2015, had doubled to around $4.5 million. The cost of advertising during the Super Bowl has reached a point that some companies may not be able to recoup their costs from the resulting revenue.&lt;ref name=forbes-4million/&gt; Some commercials airing during, or proposed to air during the game, have also attracted controversy due to the nature of their content.

Super Bowl commercials are largely limited to the United States' broadcast of the game. Complaints about the inability to view the ads are prevalent in Canada, where [[Simsub|federal "simsub" regulations]] require pay television providers to replace feeds of programs from U.S. broadcast stations with domestic feeds if they are being broadcast at the same time as a Canadian broadcast station. In 2016, the [[CRTC]], Canada's telecom regulator, enacted a policy to forbid the use of simsub during the Super Bowl, citing viewer complaints and a belief that these ads were an "integral part" of the game; [[Super Bowl LI]] was the first game to fall under this policy. The NFL's Canadian rightsholder [[Bell Media]] challenged the policy at the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|federal appeals court]], arguing that it violated the [[Broadcasting Act (1991)|Broadcasting Act]] by singling out a specific program for regulation, and devalued its broadcast rights to the game. The court, however, ruled in December 2017 that the CRTC's actions were reasonable.

Super Bowl games have frequently been among the United States' [[List of most watched television broadcasts in the United States|most watched television broadcasts]]; [[Super Bowl XLIX]] in 2015 set an all-time record for viewership at the game, with an average of 114.4 million viewers according to [[Nielsen ratings|Nielsen]], exceeding a record set the previous year at [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] (112.2 million). Of the top twenty television broadcasts in the United States by viewership, only one program—"[[Goodbye, Farewell and Amen]]", the 1983 series finale of ''[[M*A*S*H (TV series)|M*A*S*H]]''—was not a Super Bowl, ranking in between [[Super Bowl XLIII]] (98.7 million) and [[Super Bowl XLIV|XLIV]] (106.6 million) with 106 million viewers.&lt;ref name="thr-mashrecord"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/live-feed/super-bowl-dethrones-mash-sets-53083 | title=Super Bowl dethrones 'M*A*S*H,' sets all-time record | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=February 8, 2010 | last=Hibberd | first=James | access-date=February 2, 2013 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110211114725/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/blogs/live-feed/super-bowl-dethrones-mash-sets-53083 | archive-date=February 11, 2011 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tvbn-2015ratings"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/02/super-bowl-xlix-is-most-watched-show-in-u-s-television-history/358523/ | title=Super Bowl XLIX is Most-Watched Show in U.S. Television History With 114.4 Million Viewers | publisher=Tribune Media | work=TV By The Numbers | date=February 2, 2015 | access-date=March 20, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150523092250/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2015/02/02/super-bowl-xlix-is-most-watched-show-in-u-s-television-history/358523/ | archive-date=May 23, 2015 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="top-rated"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/tv-toprated.html | title=Television's Top-Rated Programs | via = sandiego.edu | publisher=[[Nielsen Media Research]] | date = April 12, 2002 | publication-date=April 30, 2000 | accessdate=January 15, 2007 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080513153855/http://history.sandiego.edu/gen/recording/tv-toprated.html | archivedate=May 13, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Nielsen SB chart"&gt;{{cite web|title=Super Bowl 50 Draws 111.9 Million TV Viewers, 16.9 Million Tweets|url=http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2016/super-bowl-50-draws-111-9-million-tv-viewers-and-16-9-million-tweets.html|publisher=Nielsen.com|accessdate=February 11, 2016|date=February 8, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160213024944/http://www.nielsen.com/us/en/insights/news/2016/super-bowl-50-draws-111-9-million-tv-viewers-and-16-9-million-tweets.html|archive-date=February 13, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; The game broadcast not only attracts a wide audience, but a diverse audience spanning many [[demographic]]s and age groups, and women have accounted for at least 40% of Super Bowl viewers. As such, airing a commercial during the Super Bowl can be valuable for advertisers seeking an audience for their products and services.&lt;ref name=forbes-4million/&gt;&lt;ref name=Adweek-womendominant&gt;{{cite web |title=Women Are the Dominant Media Voice During the Super Bowl |url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/women-are-dominant-media-voice-during-super-bowl-155227 |website=[[Adweek]] |first=Kat |last=Gordon |date=January 27, 2014 |access-date=March 20, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318224538/http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/women-are-dominant-media-voice-during-super-bowl-155227 |archive-date=March 18, 2015 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the overall [[Marketing buzz|buzz]] surrounding them, commercials aired during the Super Bowl receive additional airplay and exposure outside of the game as well, such as during [[newscast]]s and [[morning show]]s.&lt;ref name=forbes-4m /&gt;&lt;ref name=salon-beforesuperbowlad/&gt; Since 2000, [[CBS]] has aired an annual television special prior to the game, ''Super Bowl’s Greatest Commercials'', which showcases notable Super Bowl ads from prior games, and in recent years, has allowed viewers to vote for their favorite Super Bowl ads to be featured during it.&lt;ref name="thr-greatestcommercials"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/super-bowls-greatest-commercials-cbs-hosts-vote-282740 | title='Super Bowl's Greatest Commercials' Special Adds Hosts Jillian Michaels and Boomer Esiason, Fan Vote (Video) | work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]] | date=January 17, 2012 | first=Jethro | last=Nededog | access-date=March 19, 2015 | archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150318221350/http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/super-bowls-greatest-commercials-cbs-hosts-vote-282740 | archive-date=March 18, 2015 | dead-url=no | df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=deadline-cbsgreatest&gt;{{cite web|title=CBS Sets 2015 Greatest Super Bowl Commercials Special|url=http://deadline.com/2014/11/reatest-super-bowl-commercials-special-cbs-2015-1201299339/|website=Deadline|accessdate=March 19, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many viewers watch the Super Bowl only for the commercials: in 2015, [[Dish Network]] went as far as allowing the "Primetime Anytime" and "AutoHop" features on its [[Hopper (DVR)|Hopper]] [[digital video recorder]], which automatically records primetime programs from the major networks and trims commercials from the recordings, to function in reverse and allow users to view a recording of the Super Bowl that skips over the game itself and only shows the commercials.&lt;ref name=wsj-reverseautohop&gt;{{Cite web|title=Attention Football-Hating TV Commercial Lovers – This Dish is For You|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/01/29/attention-football-hating-tv-commercial-lovers-this-dish-is-for-you/|accessdate=January 29, 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=January 29, 2015|first=Amol|last=Sharma|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201054601/http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/01/29/attention-football-hating-tv-commercial-lovers-this-dish-is-for-you/|archive-date=February 1, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The popularity of video sharing websites such as [[YouTube]] have also allowed Super Bowl advertisements to become [[viral video]]s;&lt;ref name=forbes-4m/&gt; to take advantage of this, a growing number of advertisers have elected to post previews of their commercial, or even the full-length commercial, online prior to the game.&lt;ref name=time-theforce/&gt; A notable example of this strategy occurred at [[Super Bowl XLV]]: on February 2, 2011, four days prior to the game, [[Volkswagen]] posted the full version of its ''[[Star Wars]]''-themed ad "[[The Force (advertisement)|The Force]]" on YouTube.

The high cost of purchasing advertising time, on top of the cost of producing the commercial itself, has led to concerns by marketers that the increased sales that can result from a Super Bowl commercial does not recoup the cost of buying the ad time. Some advertisers, including [[Dr. Pepper Snapple Group]], [[General Motors]] and [[Pepsi]], chose to skip recent Super Bowls due to the high costs of advertising—although Pepsi would return in 2013, followed by GM in 2014. As a lower-cost alternative, some advertisers have elected to purchase advertising time during the games' extended pre-game shows (which, during [[Super Bowl XLVIII]], ranged from $100,000 to $2 million), or from individual [[network affiliates]] that are broadcasting it.&lt;ref name=forbes-4million/&gt;&lt;ref name=variety-chevy2015&gt;{{Cite web|title=How Chevrolet Freaked Out Super Bowl Viewers Without Buying an Ad During the Game|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/how-chevrolet-freaked-out-super-bowl-viewers-without-buying-an-ad-during-the-game-1201421368/|website=Variety|accessdate=March 21, 2015|first=Brian|last=Steinberg|date=February 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150331060803/http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/how-chevrolet-freaked-out-super-bowl-viewers-without-buying-an-ad-during-the-game-1201421368/|archive-date=March 31, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=adage-pregame&gt;{{cite web|title=On Fox, Super Bowl Ads Start Before the Game Does|url=http://adage.com/article/special-report-super-bowl/fox-super-bowl-ads-start-game/148610/|website=Advertising Age|accessdate=March 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402124312/http://adage.com/article/special-report-super-bowl/fox-super-bowl-ads-start-game/148610/|archive-date=April 2, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As the [[2018 Winter Olympics]] marked the first time since [[1992 Winter Olympics|1992]] that the Winter Olympics and Super Bowl were shown by the same network in a single year, NBC offered advertisers the opportunity to purchase packages of time for their ads covering both [[Super Bowl LII]] and the Olympics.

==Notable Super Bowl commercials==
{{main|List of Super Bowl commercials}}

Many Super Bowl advertisements have become iconic and well-known because of their quality, unpredictability, humor, and use of special effects. In recent years, advertisers have also attempted to stand out from others by producing ads with [[cinematography|cinematographic]] qualities, and ads that channel emotions and real-world issues.&lt;ref name=usatoday-admeter2014 /&gt;&lt;ref name=variety-11ads /&gt;&lt;ref name=lat-makeithappy /&gt; The use of celebrity cameos has also been common in Super Bowl ads, ranging from then-unknown personalities, to unexpected combinations of celebrities, such as a 2007 CBS network promo for ''[[Late Show with David Letterman|Late Show]]'' that featured [[David Letterman]] and [[Oprah Winfrey]]—whom Letterman had conflicts with following a joke directed at her during the [[67th Academy Awards]], and a 2010 sequel that also included [[Jay Leno]] (who was slated to return to its competitor, ''[[The Tonight Show]]'', following a [[2010 Tonight Show conflict|publicized conflict]] between NBC and [[Conan O'Brien]]).&lt;ref name=variety-11ads/&gt;&lt;ref name=usatoday-unlikelystars/&gt;

===Early advertising===
Several notable commercials aired during Super Bowl games during the 1970s. In a commercial during [[Super Bowl IV]] in 1970, [[Chicago Bears]] linebacker [[Dick Butkus]] endorsed [[Prestone]], a brand of [[antifreeze]], stating the tagline, "Because plugging holes is my business." The ad marked the first highly successful celebrity endorsement in Super Bowl advertising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|editor1-last=Batchelor|editor1-first=Bob|editor2-last=Coombs|editor2-first=Danielle Sarver|title=We Are What We Sell: How Advertising Shapes American Life. . .

Later in the decade, Fawcett would become better known for her role on the television series ''[[Charlie's Angels]]''.&lt;ref name=usatoday-unlikelystars&gt;{{Cite web|title=Unlikely stars emerge from Super Bowl ads|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/driveon/2013/02/04/super-bowl-ads-unlikely-stars-go-daddy-volkswagen-kia/1890265/|website=USA Today|accessdate=March 21, 2015|date=February 4, 2013|first1=Bruce|last1=Horovitz|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150130181240/http://www.usatoday.com/story/money/business/driveon/2013/02/04/super-bowl-ads-unlikely-stars-go-daddy-volkswagen-kia/1890265/|archive-date=January 30, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At [[Super Bowl XI]] in 1977, [[Xerox]] aired an advertisement entitled "Monks"; starring [[Jack Eagle]] as Brother Dominic—a monk discovering that he could create copies of a [[manuscript]] using a new Xerox [[photocopier]]. The advertisement was so well received that Brother Dominic became the mascot of Xerox for years afterward.  Xerox premiered a new version of "Monks" in January 2017 (although not as a Super Bowl ad), which updated the premise of the original ad to feature the company's modern products.[[Young &amp; Rubicam|Y&amp;R New York]]'s CEO Leslie Sims described "Monks" as being the "first viral ad", explaining that it "was the first commercial that got people to request to see it again on TV".&lt;ref name="adweek-1977update"&gt;{{cite web|title=Xerox Updates Its Iconic 1977 'Brother Dominic' Super Bowl Spot for Our Digital Age|url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/xerox-updates-its-iconic-1977-brother-dominic-super-bowl-spot-our-digital-age-175352|website=Adweek|accessdate=28 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170106133254/http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/xerox-updates-its-iconic-1977-brother-dominic-super-bowl-spot-our-digital-age-175352|archive-date=January 6, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=lat&gt;{{Cite web|first=|last=|title=Jack Eagle, Comedian acted in TV commercials|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/18/local/me-passings18.S1|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|publisher=Tribune Publishing|date=January 18, 2008|accessdate=February 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120404064751/http://articles.latimes.com/2008/jan/18/local/me-passings18.S1|archive-date=April 4, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Master Lock: "Tough Under Fire" ===
Among the most prominent of campaigns during early Super Bowl games were those of [[Master Lock]]. In 1965, the company had first run a television commercial demonstrating the strength of its [[Lock (security device)|padlocks]], by having a person shoot it with a [[handgun]] in a failed attempt to breach it. The campaign was pulled after the company's advertising director, Edson F. Allen, realized the stunt could be imitated by those who were unsure of the commercial's authenticity. By the 1970s, Allen discussed the possibility of reviving the concept, but using a [[rifle]] rather than a handgun to make it harder to imitate. The resulting commercial would premiere in 1974 during [[Super Bowl VIII]]; despite concerns by the staff of Master Lock and their agency, [[Campbell Mithun]], over the content of the ad, the commercial was well received by the general public.&lt;ref name=milwaukee-lock/&gt;&lt;ref name=usatoday-masterlock/&gt;&lt;ref name=wsj-newbieadvertisers&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Perlberg|first1=Steven|title=Super Bowl Gets a Spike in Newbie Advertisers|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/super-bowl-gets-a-spike-in-newbie-advertisers-1421876156|accessdate=March 25, 2015|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=January 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324224726/http://www.wsj.com/articles/super-bowl-gets-a-spike-in-newbie-advertisers-1421876156|archive-date=March 24, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When [[Cramer-Krasselt]] took over as Master Lock's agency later in the year, the company decided to make the gun ads a tradition, and began to produce new ads themed around the concept (including one featuring skeptics of previous editions of the ad, and one showcasing the company's major corporate clients) for future Super Bowls during the subsequent decades (aside from a brief hiatus in 1986 and 1987), and the early 1990s. Allen went as far as describing the ads as an "event" that continued to attract media attention after the game. The Super Bowl ads helped improve Master Lock's market share; from 1973 through 1994, sales had increased from $35 million per year to $200 million per year. Master Lock's yearly Super Bowl commercials accounted for nearly all of the company's annual advertising budget.&lt;ref name=milwaukee-lock&gt;{{cite web|title=Master Lock's famous commercial helps maintain lock on the market|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fpZQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EhMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4191,4036051&amp;dq=master+lock+super+bowl+ad&amp;hl=en|work=The Milwaukee Sentinel|date=March 14, 1994|accessdate=February 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906143734/https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=fpZQAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=EhMEAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4191,4036051&amp;dq=master+lock+super+bowl+ad&amp;hl=en|archive-date=September 6, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=usatoday-masterlock&gt;{{Cite web|title=Revisiting the classic Master Lock ad from 1974|url=http://admeter.usatoday.com/2015/01/09/revisiting-the-classic-master-lock-ad-from-1974/|accessdate=March 20, 2015|work=USA Today|date=January 9, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402093606/http://admeter.usatoday.com/2015/01/09/revisiting-the-classic-master-lock-ad-from-1974/|archive-date=April 2, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Master Lock article|journal=Brill's Content|date=1999|volume=2|issue=1-5|publisher=Brill Media Ventures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=33liAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=master+lock+super+bowl+budget&amp;dq=master+lock+super+bowl+budget&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=9hATVauJL82wsATj2YHYBg&amp;ved=0CD4Q6AEwBDgK|accessdate=March 25, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ambler|first1=Tim|title=The Financial Times Guide to Marketing : from advertising to zen|date=1996|publisher=Pitman Pub.|location=London|isbn=0273620320}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coca-Cola ===
At [[Super Bowl XIV]] in 1980, [[Coca-Cola]] aired an advertisement popularly known as "[[Hey Kid, Catch!]]", featuring [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] [[All-Pro]] defensive lineman [[Joe Greene (American football)|"Mean Joe" Greene]] being offered a Coca-Cola by a young fan—played by Tommy Okon,&lt;ref name=ew-joegreene/&gt; drinking it in one sip, and tossing the kid his game-worn jersey as repayment. The advertisement was filmed in 1979 and premiered that October, but did not gain mainstream attention until its airing during Super Bowl XIV. "Hey Kid, Catch!" became one of Greene's most famous roles; the ad would win a [[Clio Award]], spawn a [[made-for-TV movie]] on NBC entitled ''The Steeler and the Pittsburgh Kid'', and be re-made for other markets with local athletes. In a 2011 poll by ''[[Advertising Age]]'', readers named "Hey Kid, Catch!"  as the best Super Bowl commercial of all-time.&lt;ref name=usatoday-heykid&gt;{{Cite web|title='Hey kid, catch!'

The ad also became the subject of parodies on television series, such as ''[[The Simpsons]]'', and in other ads. At [[Super Bowl XLIII]] in 2009, Coca-Cola aired a parody of the ad for its [[Coca-Cola Zero]] brand starring Steelers [[Safety (American and Canadian football position)|safety]] [[Troy Polamalu]]. Continuing an ongoing theme in the promotion of Coke Zero, the ad was interrupted by a Coca-Cola "brand manager" accusing Polamalu of "stealing" their commercial; in response, Polamalu tackled him and ripped off his shirt to give to the child.&lt;ref name=freep-09ads&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hinds|first1=Julie|title=Super Bowl ads deliver big laughs|url=http://archive.freep.com/article/20090202/ENT03/902020367/Super-Bowl-ads-deliver-big-laughs|website=Detroit Free Press|accessdate=March 20, 2015|date=February 2, 2009|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402133105/http://archive.freep.com/article/20090202/ENT03/902020367/Super-Bowl-ads-deliver-big-laughs|archive-date=April 2, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=abchron-meanjoezero&gt;{{Cite web|title=Coke to reprise ‘Mean Joe’ commercial for Super Bowl|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2009/01/26/daily11.html|website=Atlanta Business Chronicle|accessdate=March 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402172150/http://www.bizjournals.com/atlanta/stories/2009/01/26/daily11.html|archive-date=April 2, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Procter &amp; Gamble]] aired a parody of the ad entitled "Stinky".

===Macintosh: "1984"===
{{main|1984 (advertisement)}}
[[File:Macintosh 128k transparency.png|thumb|upright|"1984", an ad for the [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh]] computer (pictured), has been widely considered the best Super Bowl ad of all-time.]]
At [[Super Bowl XVIII]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple Computer]] broadcast an advertisement for its [[Macintosh 128K|Macintosh computer]] entitled "1984", created by the agency [[Chiat/Day]] and directed by [[Ridley Scott]]. The advertisement, which incorporated elements inspired by the novel ''[[Nineteen Eighty-Four]]'', featured a woman wearing track-and-field clothing (including orange pants and a white shirt branded with an image of the Macintosh) sprinting into a large auditorium and hurling a large hammer into a screen (displaying a large [[Big Brother (Nineteen Eighty-Four)|Big Brother]]-like figure speaking to a massive assembly of drone-like people in the audience), concluding with the message "On January 24, Apple Computer will introduce the Macintosh. And you'll see why 1984 won’t be like '1984.'" The advertisement received critical acclaim from both viewers and critics alike for helping position the Macintosh as a unique entry into the [[personal computer]] market, and is often considered to be one of the best Super Bowl advertisements of all-time.&lt;ref name=Adweek-1984goodasitgets&gt;{{cite web |last1=Hayden |first1=Steve |title='1984': As Good as It Gets |url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/1984-good-it-gets-125608 |website=[[Adweek]] |date=January 30, 2011 |access-date=January 21, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150121183238/http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/1984-good-it-gets-125608 |archive-date=January 21, 2015 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=forbes-1984&gt;{{Cite web|title=Experts and Viewers Agree: Apple's '1984' Is The Best Super Bowl Ad Of All Time|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2012/01/30/experts-and-viewers-agree-apples-1984-is-the-best-super-bowl-ad-of-all-time/|work=Forbes|accessdate=February 3, 2013|first=Jacquelyn|last=Smith|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130206012848/http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2012/01/30/experts-and-viewers-agree-apples-1984-is-the-best-super-bowl-ad-of-all-time/|archive-date=February 6, 2013|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url= http://www.duke.edu/~tlove/mac.htm | title= Apple's 1984: The Introduction of the Macintosh in the Cultural History of Personal Computers | archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/19991005015117/http://www.duke.edu/~tlove/mac.htm | archivedate= October 5, 1999 | first= Ted | last= Friedman | date= October 1997 | deadurl= yes | df= mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The ad first aired nationally during Super Bowl XVIII. As the agency wanted "1984" to be eligible for that year's industry awards, which were only open to ads that aired during 1983, a low-profile premiere of the ad occurred on the [[Twin Falls, Idaho]] station [[KMVT]] on December 31, 1983 shortly before midnight.&lt;ref name=mentalfloss-1984&gt;{{cite web|title=The True Story of Apple's "1984" Ad's First Broadcast...Before the Super Bowl|url=http://mentalfloss.com/article/29911/true-story-apples-1984-ads-first-broadcastbefore-super-bowl|work=Mental Floss|accessdate=January 18, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140107034201/http://mentalfloss.com/article/29911/true-story-apples-1984-ads-first-broadcastbefore-super-bowl|archive-date=January 7, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Apple attempted to follow up "1984" the following year with a new ad entitled "[[Lemmings (advertisement)|Lemmings]]", to promote its [[Macintosh Office]] system. The ad, which featured blindfolded businessmen walking over the edge of a cliff in unison, was criticized for its "dark" theme and exaggerated premise. By contrast, "Lemmings" has been considered to be one of Apple's worst television advertisements.&lt;ref name=forbes-appleworst&gt;{{Cite web|title=Apple's Worst Ads – Before The Unfortunate 'Genius'|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2012/08/03/apples-worst-ads-before-the-unfortunate-genius/|work=Forbes|accessdate=February 3, 2013|first=Jacquelyn|last=Smith|date=August 3, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121110115649/http://www.forbes.com/sites/jacquelynsmith/2012/08/03/apples-worst-ads-before-the-unfortunate-genius/|archive-date=November 10, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Budweiser===
The [[beer]] brand [[Budweiser (Anheuser-Busch)|Budweiser]] has long been a Super Bowl fixture. Its parent company [[Anheuser-Busch]] held a long-term contract with the NFL that allowed it to buy several slots of air time from the game's broadcaster each year at a steep discount, a contract that ran through [[Super Bowl 50]];&lt;ref name="sbj-5m"&gt;Ourand, John (February 3, 2015). “[http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2015/02/02/Media/SuperBowlAds.aspx CBS price for Super Bowl 50 spot: $5M?] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150204032822/http://www.sportsbusinessdaily.com/Journal/Issues/2015/02/02/Media/SuperBowlAds.aspx |date=February 4, 2015 }}” ''Sports Business Journal''.

In 2017, Budweiser broadcast "Born the Hard Way", an ad which dramatized Anheuser-Busch co-founder [[Adolphus Busch]]'s emigration to the United States from Germany to establish the company. The advertisement attracted controversy among supporters of U.S. president [[Donald Trump]] for being pro-immigration, in the wake of an [[Executive Order 13769|executive order]] issued by Trump which briefly restricted entry into the country by residents of several countries with predominant [[Muslim]] populations.

In 2018, Budweiser broadcast "Stand by You", an ad which chronicled Anheuser-Busch's [[disaster relief]] program of distributing cans of [[drinking water]] from its brewery in [[Cartersville, Georgia]]. The Clydesdales were, once again, downplayed from its television spots, with the brewery only airing a 5-second bumper in the second quarter to promote its streaming ClydesdaleCam event.&lt;ref name="no_clydesdales"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fortune.com/2018/01/26/budweiser-2018-super-bowl-commercial-video/|title=Budweiser's New Super Bowl Has Nothing to Do With Beer|work=Fortune|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180204175925/http://fortune.com/2018/01/26/budweiser-2018-super-bowl-commercial-video/|archive-date=February 4, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Clydesdales were featured in several digital-oriented companion campaigns alongside the game, including ClydesdaleCam, a second, web-exclusive ad entitled "Beer Country", as well as themed [[Snapchat]] filters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/how-the-budweiser-clydesdales-will-make-an-appearance-during-the-super-bowl/|title=How the Budweiser Clydesdales Will Make an Appearance During the Super Bowl|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207011003/http://www.adweek.com/brand-marketing/how-the-budweiser-clydesdales-will-make-an-appearance-during-the-super-bowl/|archive-date=February 7, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Budweiser has introduced other campaigns during the Super Bowl as well. During [[Super Bowl XXIII]], Budweiser aired an episodic series of commercials known as the ''[[Bud Bowl]]''—which featured a football game between [[stop motion]]-animated beer bottles representing Budweiser and [[Bud Light]], with commentary by [[Bob Costas]] and [[Paul Maguire]]. Proving popular, the ''Bud Bowl'' would return at subsequent Super Bowls; it had become so popular that some viewers actually [[Sports betting|wagered]] on the outcome of the ''Bud Bowl'' as if it were an actual event.&lt;ref name=variety-11ads&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Stienberg|first1=Brian|title=Super Bowl Ads: 11 Commercials That Forced The Big Game To Change Its Spots|url=https://variety.com/2015/tv/news/super-bowl-ads-11-commercials-that-forced-the-big-game-to-change-its-spots-1201415196/|website=Variety|accessdate=March 21, 2015|date=January 26, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150324100122/http://variety.com/2015/tv/news/super-bowl-ads-11-commercials-that-forced-the-big-game-to-change-its-spots-1201415196/|archive-date=March 24, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=trib-budbowl&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bud Bowl-king Of Ads For The King Of Beers|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-11-17/business/9104140117_1_beer-bottle-computer-animation-super-bowl|accessdate=March 21, 2015|work=Chicago Tribune|date=November 17, 1991|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402123817/http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1991-11-17/business/9104140117_1_beer-bottle-computer-animation-super-bowl|archive-date=April 2, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ds-budbowl&gt;{{cite web|title=Not-So-Secret Origin Of The Bud Bowl, Including Surprise, Alternate Ending|url=http://deadspin.com/5139483/not+so+secret-origin-of-the-bud-bowl-including-surprise-alternate-ending?autoplay=true|work=Deadspin|publisher=[[Gawker Media]]|accessdate=February 6, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140222001541/http://deadspin.com/5139483/not+so+secret-origin-of-the-bud-bowl-including-surprise-alternate-ending?autoplay=true|archive-date=February 22, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, Budweiser introduced the first of a series of ads featuring a group of three [[Budweiser Frogs|frogs]] named Bud, Weis, and Er.

The ad featured scenes depicting the history and revitalization of [[Detroit]], as well as local rapper [[Eminem]] and his song "[[Lose Yourself]]". The ad was critically acclaimed, and won a [[63rd Primetime Creative Arts Emmy Awards|Creative Arts Emmy Award]] for "Best Commercial" in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Mark Memmott |url=https://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2011/02/08/133592299/eminems-imported-from-detroit-super-bowl-ad-for-chrysler-scores-big |title=Eminem's 'Imported from Detroit' Super Bowl Ad For Chrysler Scores Big : The Two-Way |publisher=NPR |date=2011-02-08 |accessdate=2016-02-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20171029065528/http://www.npr.org/sections/thetwo-way/2011/02/08/133592299/eminems-imported-from-detroit-super-bowl-ad-for-chrysler-scores-big |archive-date=October 29, 2017 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Tetzeli |first=Rick |url=http://www.fastcompany.com/1724789/super-bowl-ad-stories-chrysler-eminem-break-awkward-silence-detroit |title=Super Bowl Ad Stories: Chrysler, Eminem Break an Awkward Silence in Detroit |website=Fast Company |date=2011-02-07 |accessdate=2016-02-08 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170207114426/https://www.fastcompany.com/1724789/super-bowl-ad-stories-chrysler-eminem-break-awkward-silence-detroit |archive-date=February 7, 2017 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Ashley C.

During [[Super Bowl XLVI]],  Chrysler broadcast "Halftime in America", a two-minute long commercial directed by [[David Gordon Green]], written by poet [[Matthew Dickman]] and narrated by actor [[Clint Eastwood]]. The commercial recounted the [[automotive industry crisis of 2008–10]], set to scenes showing Americans in despair, but then in hope. The narration of the ad equated the emergence from the crisis to the second half of a football game, explaining that "All that matters now is what’s ahead: how do we come from behind? How do we come together? And how do we win? Detroit’s showing us it can be done. And what’s true about them is true about all of us. This country can’t be knocked out with one punch. We get right back up again, and when we do the world’s gonna hear the roar of our engines." The ad was heavily viewed online after the game, receiving over 4 million views on [[YouTube]] within 36 hours, but also attracted [[#Chrysler: "Halftime in America"|controversy]] due to its political overtones.&lt;ref name=time-halftimeinamerica&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Corliss |first1=Richard |title=Clint’s Halftime Ad: From the Director of Pineapple Express |url=http://entertainment.time.com/2012/02/07/clints-chrysler-ad-from-the-director-of-pineapple-express/ |website=[[Time.com]] |publisher=[[Time Inc.|Time]] |date=February 7, 2012 |access-date=March 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402091337/http://entertainment.time.com/2012/02/07/clints-chrysler-ad-from-the-director-of-pineapple-express/ |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Dot-com commercials during Super Bowl XXXIV}}
[[Super Bowl XXXIV]] (2000) became notable for featuring a large number of commercials from [[dot-com company|dot-com companies]], to the extent that critics dubbed it the "Dot-com Super Bowl".&lt;ref name="Comp1"&gt;Shroeder, Charlie.

Despite their aspirations and the boosts in traffic they received from the ads, all of the publicly held companies which advertised saw their stocks slump after the game as the [[dot-com bubble]] began to rapidly deflate. Some of the companies that advertised during the game—including [[Epidemic Marketing]] and [[Pets.com]], had become defunct by the end of the year, and at [[Super Bowl XXXV]], only three dot-com companies—[[E-Trade]], [[HotJobs]], and [[Monster.com]]—advertised during the game.&lt;ref name=sfchron-dotcomsuperbowl&gt;{{Cite web|title=Dot-Com Super Bowl Advertisers Fumble / But Down Under, LifeMinders.com may win at Olympics|url=http://www.sfgate.com/business/networth/article/Dot-Com-Super-Bowl-Advertisers-Fumble-But-Down-2739134.php|accessdate=March 18, 2015|work=San Francisco Chronicle|first=Kathleen|last=Pender|date=September 13, 2000|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160201190730/http://www.sfgate.com/business/networth/article/Dot-Com-Super-Bowl-Advertisers-Fumble-But-Down-2739134.php|archive-date=February 1, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bloom"&gt;Hyman, Mark, and Tom Lowry.

=== Doritos ===
In 2006, [[Doritos]] began holding a promotion known as ''[[Crash the Super Bowl]]'', soliciting viewers to film their own Doritos commercials to possibly be aired during the game. At [[Super Bowl XLIII]] in 2009, an additional bonus prize of $1 million was added if any of the winning entries were named #1 on the Super Bowl Ad Meter survey results; Doritos would reach the #1 spot on the survey that year with an ad entitled "Free Doritos", created by Joe and Dave Herbert of [[Batesville, Indiana|Batesville]], [[Indiana]].

===GoDaddy===
The [[Domain name registrar|domain registrar]] and [[web hosting]] company [[GoDaddy]] was well known for producing Super Bowl commercials featuring female spokespersons it dubbed "GoDaddy Girls", such as professional driver [[Danica Patrick]], and for its 2011 ad, comedian [[Joan Rivers]].&lt;ref name=adage-godaddybumpy/&gt; Many of the company's planned Super Bowl ads were allegedly rejected by broadcasters due to their risqué subject matter, leading to GoDaddy instead airing a "teaser" ad during the game that instructed viewers to watch the uncensored version of the ad on their website.&lt;ref name=adage-godaddybumpy/&gt;

The company's first appearance at [[Super Bowl XXXIX]] parodied the "[[Super Bowl XXXVIII halftime show controversy|wardrobe malfunction]]" that had occurred at last year's halftime show,&lt;ref name=Adweek-nomoresleaze/&gt; featuring a woman testifying to [[United States Congress|Congress]] about why GoDaddy wanted to advertise during the game, but a strap of her [[tank top]] coming undone. The ad was scheduled to air twice, but its second airing was pulled in response to concerns by Fox and the NFL over its content. The following year at [[Super Bowl XL]], thirteen ad concepts were rejected by [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] due to their content.&lt;ref name=adage-godaddybumpy&gt;{{cite web|last1=Stienberg|first1=Brian|title=GoDaddy Taking a Less Bumpy Road to Super Bowl Ads|url=http://adage.com/article/special-report-super-bowl/godaddy-taking-a-bumpy-road-super-bowl-ads/231439/|website=Advertising Age|accessdate=April 6, 2015|date=December 8, 2011|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150228105209/http://adage.com/article/special-report-super-bowl/godaddy-taking-a-bumpy-road-super-bowl-ads/231439/|archive-date=February 28, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ft-godaddy&gt;{{cite web |last1=Calkins |first1=Tim |author2=Rucker |title=Case study: GoDaddy and the Super Bowl |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9ff5a8ba-347d-11e0-9ebc-00144feabdc0.html |accessdate=April 6, 2015 |work=[[Financial Times]] |date=February 9, 2011 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402002643/http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/9ff5a8ba-347d-11e0-9ebc-00144feabdc0.html |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, a GoDaddy ad entitled "Exposure" was rejected by Fox for using the word "[[beaver]]" as a [[double entendre]]. In turn, the ad was replaced with one advertising the availability of the ad on GoDaddy's website, attracting two million visits.&lt;ref name=adage-godaddyexposure&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hampp|first1=Andrew|title=GoDaddy Super Bowl Spot Sets Web-Traffic Record|url=http://adage.com/article/digital/godaddy-super-bowl-spot-sets-web-traffic-record/124846/|accessdate=April 6, 2015|work=Advertising Age|date=February 4, 2008|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160203082021/http://adage.com/article/digital/godaddy-super-bowl-spot-sets-web-traffic-record/124846/|archive-date=February 3, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2013, GoDaddy's chief marketing officer Barb Rechterman announced that the company would no longer air provocative ads during the Super Bowl, explaining that "our new brand of Super Bowl commercials will make it crystal clear what we do and who we stand for. We may be changing our approach, but as we've always said, we don't care what the critics think. We are all about our customers."&lt;ref name=Adweek-nomoresleaze&gt;{{cite web |last1=Nudd |first1=Tim |title=Go Daddy Promises No More Sleazy Super Bowl Ads |url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/go-daddy-promises-no-more-sleazy-super-bowl-ads-153518 |website=[[Adweek]] |date=October 31, 2013 |access-date=April 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311193021/http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/go-daddy-promises-no-more-sleazy-super-bowl-ads-153518 |archive-date=March 11, 2015 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

GoDaddy's ad in 2015, "Journey Home", was controversial for different reasons: it featured a puppy travelling back to its owner after falling out of a pickup truck, only to learn that he had been sold to a new owner using a website built with GoDaddy. The ad was criticized by animal rights groups, who felt that it implied an endorsement of commercial [[puppy mill]]s. GoDaddy quickly pulled the ad in response to the controversy; GoDaddy CEO [[Blake Irving]] explained that the ad's humor had "clearly missed the mark". [[PETA]] partially praised the ad for portraying the seller as being a "callous jerk", but explained that "The sale of animals online and from pet stores and breeders should be roundly condemned, and it was today. GoDaddy did the right thing by swiftly promoting adoption."&lt;ref name=Adweek-puppymill&gt;{{cite web |last1=Monollos |first1=Kristina |title=GoDaddy Pulls Super Bowl Ad After Complaints About 'Puppy Mill' Humor |url=http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/godaddy-pulls-super-bowl-ad-after-complaints-about-puppy-mill-humor-162590 |work=[[Adweek]] |date=January 27, 2015 |access-date=April 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150405083518/http://www.adweek.com/news/advertising-branding/godaddy-pulls-super-bowl-ad-after-complaints-about-puppy-mill-humor-162590 |archive-date=April 5, 2015 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=slate-godaddypuppy&gt;{{cite web |last1=Alison |first1=Griswold |title=Apparently Puppies Aren’t Always a Safe Bet in Super Bowl Ads |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2015/01/28/budweiser_lost_dog_and_godaddy_journey_home_super_bowl_ads_love_puppies.html |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |publisher=[[The Slate Group]] |date=January 28, 2015 |access-date=April 6, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402084455/http://www.slate.com/blogs/moneybox/2015/01/28/budweiser_lost_dog_and_godaddy_journey_home_super_bowl_ads_love_puppies.html |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== "Small Business Big Game" ===
As a byproduct of the increased cost of ad time at the Super Bowl, financial software company [[Intuit]] made its debut at [[Super Bowl XLVIII]] by hosting a promotion known as "Small Business Big Game", in which [[small business]]es with "inspiring" stories competed for a chance to earn a commercial during the Super Bowl funded by Intuit, as decided by user votes. Company CEO [[Brad D. Smith]] explained that the promotion was an extension of the company's goals to improve financial lives "in a way that you'd never imagine going back", while Ken Wach, senior vice president of marketing for Intuit's Small Business Group, explained that "normally you're looking at Budweiser ads or Chevy ads, so this was about putting small businesses on the national stage and shining the spotlight on them as heroes of the economy."&lt;ref name="wsj-sbbg"/&gt;

The winner of the 2014 edition was [[GoldieBlox]], a toy company with a focus on promoting [[mechanical engineering]] to young girls.&lt;ref name="wsj-sbbg"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Tadnea|first1=Nathalie|title=How Intuit Refined Its ‘Small Business Big Game’ Super Bowl Strategy|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/how-intuit-refined-its-small-business-big-game-super-bowl-strategy-1448037331|accessdate=February 3, 2016|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=November 20, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160202050746/http://www.wsj.com/articles/how-intuit-refined-its-small-business-big-game-super-bowl-strategy-1448037331|archive-date=February 2, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; While the campaign was a success for the winner, resulting in increased prominence and sales, Wach felt that Intuit was not able to "sustain the momentum as much as we would have liked".

=== "I'm going to Disney World!" ===
[[Disney Parks]] is known for an advertising campaign associated with the Super Bowl entitled "What's Next?", but more popularly known as "[[I'm going to Disney World!]]". The ads feature a player from the winning team (typically the [[Super Bowl MVP|MVP]]) responding with the eponymous declaration after being asked what they would do after the game. These ads typically premiere on the day after the Super Bowl. The series began following [[Super Bowl XXI]], and first featured [[Phil Simms]] of the [[New York Giants]]. Disney has reportedly offered players $30,000 if they participate in the commercial and visit a Disney theme park (usually [[Disney World]] or [[Disneyland]]) afterward, and has extended the campaign to champion players in other sports. At [[Super Bowl XL]], Disney aired an in-game commercial themed around the campaign, featuring [[Pittsburgh Steelers]] and [[Seattle Seahawks]] players rehearsing the line in case they won.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06038/651246-66.stm|title=Ward's MVP performance in Super Bowl XL puts him in special class|work=Pittsburgh Post-Gazette|access-date=2018-02-07|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110522154405/http://www.post-gazette.com/pg/06038/651246-66.stm|archive-date=May 22, 2011|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/12/sports/different-fortunes-for-two-champions-giants-have-a-quiet-off-season.html,%20https://www.nytimes.com/1987/07/12/sports/different-fortunes-for-two-champions-giants-have-a-quiet-off-season.html?pagewanted=all|title=Different Fortunes for Two Champions; GIANTS HAVE A QUIET OFF SEASON|last=Litsky|first=Frank|date=1987-07-12|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/26/sports/super-bowl-xxxii-notebook-not-going-to-disneyland.html|title=SUPER BOWL XXXII: NOTEBOOK; Not Going to Disneyland|last=Jolly|first=Tom|date=1998|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-07|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208004353/http://www.nytimes.com/1998/01/26/sports/super-bowl-xxxii-notebook-not-going-to-disneyland.html|archive-date=February 8, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Local advertising during the Super Bowl ==
&lt;!-- Only add examples that have been covered by notable _national_ sources. --&gt;
In order to dodge the high costs of obtaining national ad time, or to broadcast more regionalized campaigns, some advertisers elect to purchase local advertising time from the individual network affiliates airing the Super Bowl, such as the [[Church of Scientology]]—who bought local ad time in major urban markets such as [[New York City]] in 2014, and the [[Bank of Montreal]] to promote its [[BMO Harris Bank]] branches.&lt;ref name=gandm-bbad /&gt;&lt;ref name=slate-scientology&gt;{{cite web |title=Watch That Creepy Scientology Ad From the Super Bowl |url=http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2014/02/02/scientology_super_bowl_ad_2014_watch_the_tv_spot_for_the_religion_that_aired.html |work=[[Slate (magazine)|Slate]] |publisher=[[The Slate Group]] |date=February 2, 2014 |first=Jeffrey |last=Bloomer |access-date=February 3, 2014 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203223149/http://www.slate.com/blogs/the_slatest/2014/02/02/scientology_super_bowl_ad_2014_watch_the_tv_spot_for_the_religion_that_aired.html |archive-date=February 3, 2014 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, [[Old Milwaukee]] broadcast a Super Bowl ad starring [[Will Ferrell]]; as an extension of the beer's regional campaign with the actor, the ad only aired in the city of [[North Platte, Nebraska]].&lt;ref name=Adweek-milwaukee&gt;{{cite web|title=Old Milwaukee Airs Will Ferrell Super Bowl Ad in North Platte, Neb.|url=http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/old-milwaukee-airs-will-ferrell-super-bowl-ad-north-platte-neb-138074|work=[[Adweek]]|accessdate=February 3, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140221162215/http://www.adweek.com/adfreak/old-milwaukee-airs-will-ferrell-super-bowl-ad-north-platte-neb-138074|archive-date=February 21, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, several notable local ads were broadcast.

[[Political advertising]] and most direct forms of issue-related advertising are usually not aired during the Super Bowl because of [[equal-time rule]]s or other factors,&lt;ref&gt;Teinowitz, Ira.

=== Just For Feet: "Kenyan Mission" ===
At [[Super Bowl XXXIII]], footwear retailer [[Just For Feet]] aired its first Super Bowl ad. In the commercial, a barefoot [[Kenya]]n runner is tracked by a group of Caucasian men in a [[Humvee]]. The runner is offered drug-laced water which knocks him unconscious; when he wakes up, the runner discovers that the men had given him [[Nike Inc.|Nike]] shoes. The runner rejects the shoes and attempts to shake them off whilst running away.&lt;ref name="salon-adfromhell"/&gt;

The ad was widely criticized for its derogatory premise; [[Bob Garfield]] described the commercial as being "[[Neocolonialism|neo-colonialist]]", "culturally [[Imperialism|imperialist]]", and "probably [[racist]]", while Chuck McBride, creative director of Nike's agency [[Wieden+Kennedy]], stated that he "couldn't believe that they had done this." Just For Feet had spent $7 million on the ad, including $1.7 million for the time, and the rest on production and promotional costs. Despite its concerns about its content, Just For Feet relied on the expertise of their hired agency, [[Saatchi &amp; Saatchi]], because they assured that the ad was their best work. Just For Feet CEO Harold Ruttenberg explained to ''[[Salon (website)|Salon]]'' that "we took out advertisements. We gave away more than $1 million of product. Then the ad runs. And you would not believe the deluge of comments made about this company. I couldn't sleep for a solid month. And it's all because of these guys who said they knew everything."&lt;ref name="salon-adfromhell"/&gt;

Just For Feet filed a $10 million lawsuit against Saatchi &amp; Saatchi for [[malpractice]], alleging that the agency was damaging its reputation and goodwill through its "appallingly unacceptable and shockingly unprofessional performance", which ran "contrary to the deepest held principles of Just for Feet, which has always sought to promote racial harmony, finds racism abhorrent, and condemns drug use." Just for Feet filed for [[chapter 11 bankruptcy]] in November 1999, and the lawsuit was dropped. It was later found that the company had been engaging in [[accounting fraud]].&lt;ref name="salon-adfromhell"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.salon.com/1999/05/28/kenya/|title=The ad from hell|date=1999-05-28|work=Salon|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180207122817/https://www.salon.com/1999/05/28/kenya/|archive-date=February 7, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2006-02-03-super-ads-usat_x.htm|title=Ten rules to make ads magical|website=USA Today|access-date=2018-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807170107/http://usatoday30.usatoday.com/money/advertising/2006-02-03-super-ads-usat_x.htm|archive-date=August 7, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bizjournals.com/birmingham/stories/2000/04/03/focus4.html|title=Just For Feet: The rise and fall of a superstar|website=www.bizjournals.com|access-date=2018-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170302112100/http://www.bizjournals.com/birmingham/stories/2000/04/03/focus4.html|archive-date=March 2, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB105278122330015100|title=Former Official at Just for Feet Pleads Guilty to Fraud Charges|last=|first=|date=|work=Wall Street Journal|access-date=2018-02-06|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180102214014/https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB105278122330015100|archive-date=2018-01-02|dead-url=yes|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== General Motors: "Robot" ===
At [[Super Bowl XLI]], [[General Motors]] aired a 60-second ad entitled "Robot", which was meant to promote the powertrain warranty it offered for its vehicles. Themed around an "obsession" with quality, the ad depicted an assembly line robot being fired for dropping a screw. After attempting several alternative careers, the robot is depicted committing [[suicide]] by rolling off the edge of a bridge into a river. The sequence is interrupted to reveal that the events were just a dream, and that the robot had not been fired at all. Although ranking in ninth place on the Adbowl survey, "Robot" received criticism for its glamorization of suicide; the [[American Foundation for Suicide Prevention]] (AFSP) was a notable critic of the spot, as well as the [[National Alliance on Mental Illness]] (NAMI) and other suicide prevention groups. The AFSP stated that "the ad, in its carelessness, portrays suicide as a viable option when someone fails or loses their job."&lt;ref name="adage-gmrobot"&gt;{{cite web|title=GM to Edit Super Bowl Suicidal Robot Spot|url=http://adage.com/article/news/gm-edit-super-bowl-suicidal-robot-spot/114888/|website=Advertising Age|accessdate=January 31, 2016|date=February 9, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160206185853/http://adage.com/article/news/gm-edit-super-bowl-suicidal-robot-spot/114888/|archive-date=February 6, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cnnmoney-gmrobor"&gt;{{cite web|title=GM changing robot suicide ad|url=http://money.cnn.com/2007/02/09/news/companies/gm_robotad/|website=CNNMoney.com|accessdate=January 31, 2016|date=February 9, 2007|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160207140038/http://money.cnn.com/2007/02/09/news/companies/gm_robotad/|archive-date=February 7, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some critics also interpreted the ad's thematics as being in poor taste, as GM had laid off 35,000 factory workers in the previous year.&lt;ref name="cnnmoney-gmrobor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mpp"&gt;{{cite web|title=GM's Wild Ride Of A Week Results In Robot Ad Revision|url=http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/55335/gms-wild-ride-of-a-week-results-in-robot-ad-revis.html?edition=|publisher=MediaPost Publications|accessdate=January 31, 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20151003054230/http://www.mediapost.com/publications/article/55335/gms-wild-ride-of-a-week-results-in-robot-ad-revis.html?edition=|archive-date=October 3, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A GM spokesperson defended the commercial as being "a story of GM's commitment to quality", and stated that this was "the predominant impression by previewers of the ad". GM pulled the original version of the ad from its YouTube page, and edited the ad to remove the suicide scene from future airings.&lt;ref name="cnnmoney-gmrobor"/&gt;&lt;ref name="mpp"/&gt;

[[File:Tim Tebow Denver Sports Authority Field 2012-01-01.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Focus on the Family]] received criticism for its [[pro-life]] ad featuring [[Tim Tebow]].]]
{{main|Focus on the Family#Football advertisements}}
At [[Super Bowl XLIV]], the non-profit evangelical organization [[Focus on the Family]] aired an advertisement featuring then-[[Florida Gators football|Florida Gators]] [[quarterback]] [[Tim Tebow]] and his mother, Pam. Prior to becoming pregnant with Tim, and while serving as [[Baptist]] [[missionaries]] in the [[Philippines]], Pam had contracted [[amoebic dysentery]] and fell into a [[coma]]. She discovered she was pregnant while recovering. Because of the medications used to treat her, the fetus experienced a severe [[placental abruption]].&lt;ref name="Early years"/&gt; Doctors expected a [[stillbirth]] and recommended an [[abortion]]. The Tebows decided against it, citing their strong faith.&lt;ref name="Early years"&gt;{{cite web|title=Coaching character|url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20071007/NEWS/710060317?p=1&amp;tc=pg|work=The Gainesville Sun|last=Richardson|first=Suzy A.|date=October 7, 2007|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6C3RRbZ4e?url=http://www.gainesville.com/article/20071007/NEWS/710060317?p%3D1%26tc%3Dpg|archivedate=November 9, 2012|accessdate=November 10, 2007|deadurl=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the ad, Pam described Tim as a "miracle baby" who "almost didn't make it into this world", and remarked that "with all our family's been through, we have to be tough"—after which she was tackled by Tim.

The then-unseen ad drew criticism from some women's rights groups, who asked CBS to pull the ad because they felt it would be divisive.

===Ashley Madison and ManCrunch===
[[Avid Life Media]], an operator of [[online dating service]]s, has had two Super Bowl ads rejected by broadcasters. In 2009, [[NBC]] rejected an ad for the [[extramarital]] dating site [[Ashley Madison]], which featured the tagline "Who Are You Doing After the Game?", from appearing during [[Super Bowl XLIII]].&lt;ref name=nydailynews/&gt;  Avid Life Media's CEO [[Noel Biderman]] felt the rejection was "ridiculous", noting an apparent [[double standard]] of allowing advertisements for [[alcoholic beverage]]s to air during NFL games despite the number of [[Long-term effects of alcohol#Alcohol-related deaths|deaths]] attributed to them. Biderman considered the NFL demographic to be a core audience of the site, and promised to "find a way to let them know about the existence of this service."&lt;ref name=nydailynews&gt;{{Cite web| last=Hill| first=Catey| date=January 29, 2009| url=http://www.nydailynews.com/money/2009/01/28/2009-01-28_banned_these_ads_are_too_racy_for_the_su-1.html| title=Banned!

The following year at [[Super Bowl XLIV]], an advertisement for Ashley Madison's sister site [[ManCrunch]]—a dating website for [[homosexual]] relationships—was rejected by [[CBS]]. The ad featured two male football fans reaching into the same bowl of chips, and after a brief pause, passionately kissing and [[dry humping]] each other, much to the surprise of another man present. Company spokesperson Elissa Buchter considered the rejection to be discrimination, by contending that CBS would not have objected to the ad had it featured a kiss between a man and a woman, and acknowledging the frequent airplay of advertisements for [[erectile dysfunction]] medications on U.S. television as a double standard. Fellow spokesperson Dominic Friesen stated that the company was "very disappointed" of CBS's decision, noting that the network had allowed the aforementioned Focus on the Family ad to air during the game.&lt;ref name=fancast-mancrunch/&gt;&lt;ref name=hp-mancrunch&gt;{{Cite web|title=ManCrunch SuperBowl Ad REJECTED: Gay Dating Site Ad Denied By CBS (VIDEO)|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/28/mancrunch-superbowl-ad-ga_n_440773.html|work=Huffington Post|publisher=[[AOL]]|accessdate=February 5, 2014|first=Danny|last=Shea|date=January 28, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140109235939/http://www.huffingtonpost.com/2010/01/28/mancrunch-superbowl-ad-ga_n_440773.html|archive-date=January 9, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[New York Post]]'' writer felt that their ad was "no more racy than nearly any beer commercial not starring the Budweiser Clydesdales".&lt;ref name=nyp-mancrunch&gt;{{Cite web|title=Man-kiss ad isn't gay-OK with CBS|url=http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/all_guy_dating_site_gets_super_bowl_fCCRuiVFPXkWlORm7cs03N|publisher=The New York Post|accessdate=February 2, 2013|first=Amanda|last=Melillo|date=January 29, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120416000859/http://www.nypost.com/p/news/national/all_guy_dating_site_gets_super_bowl_fCCRuiVFPXkWlORm7cs03N|archive-date=April 16, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Avid Life was also accused of [[ambush marketing]] by critics, who argued that the company was intentionally submitting ads that would get rejected by broadcasters and receive free publicity from the ensuing controversy, thus removing the need to actually buy ad time during the game. However, the company denied these claims, and indicated that it did have serious intentions to purchase ad time during the game if its commercials were accepted.&lt;ref name=fancast-mancrunch&gt;{{cite web|last=Phillips|first=Tracy|title=CBS Rejects Gay Dating Site’s Super Bowl Ad|url=http://www.fancast.com/blogs/2010/tv-news/cbs-rejects-gay-themed-super-bowl-ad/|work=Fancast.com|accessdate=February 5, 2014|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110310131813/http://www.fancast.com/blogs/2010/tv-news/cbs-rejects-gay-themed-super-bowl-ad|archivedate=March 10, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hp-mancrunch/&gt;  In an article posted following the 2015 security breach of Ashley Madison, a former CBS standards &amp; practices employee stated that the ManCrunch ad had actually been rejected for its use of NFL trademarks, and not because of its content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Bartlett|first1=Kristen|title=How Ashley Madison ruined my reputation (on purpose) long before the hack.|url=http://happyplace.someecards.com/workplace/ashley-madison-avid-life-media-super-bowl-homophobic-ad/|accessdate=July 22, 2015|publisher=[[Someecards]]|date=July 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150722134807/http://happyplace.someecards.com/workplace/ashley-madison-avid-life-media-super-bowl-homophobic-ad/|archive-date=July 22, 2015|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===PETA===
[[Animal rights]] activist organization [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals]], known for its salacious and shocking [[publicity stunt]]s, has routinely submitted Super Bowl ads that have been rejected. Most of the advertisements have been explicitly sexual in nature. In 2018, PETA submitted a [[blasphemy|blasphemous]] advertisement instead, with a priest (portrayed by [[James Cromwell]]) telling a meat industry executive that he could not be forgiven for the sins of what PETA claimed were deceptive advertisements, even if he confessed. NBC expressed willingness to air the 2018 advertisement on the condition that the organization would buy additional ads during the [[2018 Winter Olympics]], which would have doubled the price; PETA refused and accused the network of [[price gouging]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a15886361/peta-super-bowl-ad-james-cromwell/|title=PETA Just Released an Incredibly Controversial "Super Bowl" Ad|first=Megan|last=Friedman|work=Country Living|date=January 25, 2018|accessdate=January 28, 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180129005022/http://www.countryliving.com/life/entertainment/a15886361/peta-super-bowl-ad-james-cromwell/|archive-date=January 29, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Randall Terry anti-abortion ad ===
In 2012, [[Randall Terry]] attempted to use a provision in [[Federal Communications Commission]] policies requiring "reasonable access" to local [[political advertising|advertising time for political candidates]] within 45 days of an election or primary, to force several [[NBC]] stations to air a graphic [[anti-abortion]] [[attack ad]] during [[Super Bowl XLVI]] that featured images of blood-covered [[fetus]]es. Following a complaint by the Chicago-based [[NBC Owned Television Stations|NBC-owned]] station [[WMAQ-TV|WMAQ]], the FCC ruled that Terry could not expect reasonable access to advertising time during the Super Bowl because of the magnitude of the event and the limited amount of local advertising time available. Furthermore, it was also found that Terry did not show enough evidence that he was a ''bona fide'' candidate eligible to receive ad time in the first place.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0212/72430.html |title=FCC Can Nix Super Bowl Ad |work=Politico |date=February 3, 2012 |accessdate=February 3, 2012 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120204123217/http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0212/72430.html |archive-date=February 4, 2012 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-fetus&gt;{{Cite web|title=Randall Terry's self-promoting Super Bowl fetus ads|url=https://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/12/randall-terry-super-bowl-fetus-ads|work=The Guardian|accessdate=February 2, 2013|location=London|first=Amanda|last=Marcotte|date=January 12, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131227101916/http://www.theguardian.com/commentisfree/cifamerica/2012/jan/12/randall-terry-super-bowl-fetus-ads|archive-date=December 27, 2013|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Chrysler: "Halftime in America" ===
{{main|Halftime in America}}
Chrysler's [[Super Bowl XLVI]] ad "Halftime in America" was controversial due to its political overtones, especially as it came during the lead-up to the [[United States presidential election, 2012|2012 U.S. presidential election]]. Critics interpreted the ad as being in support of re-electing [[Barack Obama]], suggesting that the metaphor of "[[halftime]] in America" symbolized the performance of Obama's first four-year term as president going into his re-election campaign, and noting Obama had supported [[George W. Bush]]'s bailout of Chrysler whilst acting as a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]] senator.&lt;ref name=newyorker-bushbailout&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cassidy|first1=John|title=An Inconvenient Truth: It Was George W.

Eastwood would later appear as a surprise guest at the [[2012 Republican National Convention]] in support of nominee [[Mitt Romney]], [[Clint Eastwood at the 2012 Republican National Convention|addressing an empty chair meant to represent Obama]].&lt;ref name=time-halftimeinamerica/&gt;&lt;ref name="BarbaroShear"&gt;{{Cite web|last1=Barbaro|first1=Michael|last2=Shear|first2=Michael D.|title=Before Talk With a Chair, Clearance From the Top|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/01/us/politics/romney-aides-scratch-their-heads-over-eastwoods-speech.html|work=The New York Times|accessdate=August 31, 2012|date=August 31, 2012|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120901022917/http://www.nytimes.com/2012/09/01/us/politics/romney-aides-scratch-their-heads-over-eastwoods-speech.html|archive-date=September 1, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nyt-chrysler2012&gt;{{Cite web |last1=Blow |first1=Charles M. |title=It’s Halftime in America |url=http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/its-halftime-in-america/?_r=0 |work=[[The New York Times]] |date=February 6, 2012 |access-date=March 25, 2015 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402164457/http://campaignstops.blogs.nytimes.com/2012/02/06/its-halftime-in-america/?_r=0 |archive-date=April 2, 2015 |dead-url=no |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===SodaStream===
In 2013, [[SodaStream]] submitted a Super Bowl advertisement directed by [[Alex Bogusky]], which featured a pair of [[Coca-Cola]] and [[Pepsi]] deliverymen finding their bottles exploding and disappearing when another person uses the SodaStream to make their own beverages; representing a [[Disruptive innovation|disruption]] of the [[soft drink]] market. The ad was rejected by [[CBS]] for its direct attacks towards the two rival companies.&lt;ref name=dailybeast-soda&gt;{{cite web|title=How SodaStream Took on the Super Bowl—and Lost, Then Won|url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/02/01/how-sodastream-took-on-the-super-bowl-and-lost-then-won.html|work=The Daily Beast|accessdate=February 3, 2013|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130203020441/http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2013/02/01/how-sodastream-took-on-the-super-bowl-and-lost-then-won.html|archive-date=February 3, 2013|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A ''[[Forbes]]'' writer expressed concern that the network may have had intentionally shown [[protectionism]] towards the two soft drink companies (who have been long-time Super Bowl advertisers), and drew comparisons to a recent incident where the [[CBS Interactive|CBS-owned]] technology news site [[CNET]] was controversially forced by its parent company to block [[Dish Network]]'s [[Hopper (DVR)|Hopper with Sling]] [[digital video recorder]] from being considered Best in Show at [[International CES|CES 2013]] because the broadcaster was in active litigation over an automatic [[commercial skipping]] feature on the device.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Burns|first=Will|title=CBS Bans SodaStream Ad.

An older SodaStream commercial was shown in its place, which also featured exploding pop bottles in a similar fashion, but with no direct references to any other brand;&lt;ref name=dailybeast-soda/&gt; ironically, this particular ad had been banned in the United Kingdom by [[Clearcast]] for being considered "a denigration of the bottled drinks market."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Sweney|first=Mark|title=SodaStream to seek legal advice after ad ban appeal fails|url=https://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/dec/04/sodastream-fails-ad-ban|accessdate=January 25, 2013|newspaper=[[The Guardian]]|date=December 4, 2012|location=London|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140203181610/http://www.theguardian.com/media/2012/dec/04/sodastream-fails-ad-ban|archive-date=February 3, 2014|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coca-Cola: "It's Beautiful" ===
In 2014, [[Coca-Cola]] aired a Super Bowl advertisement entitled "It's Beautiful"; themed around [[multiculturalism]], the ad featured scenes depicting [[Race and ethnicity in the United States|Americans of various ethnicities]], along with a [[same-sex couple]]—the first to ever appear in a Super Bowl ad, set to a rendition of the [[American patriotic music|patriotic]] hymn "[[America The Beautiful]]" with lyrics sung in multiple languages.&lt;ref name=time-cocacolaad/&gt;&lt;ref name=guardian-cocacolaad/&gt;

The ad was divisive, with users taking to [[Twitter]] under the [[hashtag]] "#SpeakAmerican" to discuss their views and opinions on its content: those against the ad argued that per the [[melting pot]] principle, Coca-Cola should not have used languages other than [[English language|English]], the [[Languages of the United States|most common language of the country]], to promote its products to ethnic minorities, and former [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[Congressman]] [[Allen West (politician)|Allen West]] stated that "If we cannot be proud enough as a country to sing 'America the Beautiful' in English in a commercial during the Super Bowl, by a company as American as they come—doggone we are on the road to perdition." By contrast, others praised the ad for celebrating the diversity of American people. ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' writer [[Jill Filipovic]] noted that the company had been increasingly targeting minorities, such as [[Latino American]]s (who are more likely to be heavy drinkers of soft drinks because of their low cost) and drew comparisons to the marketing of [[cigarettes]] to women, but that "before we applaud Coke's advertising diversity, we should ask: do we really want Coke to diversify?"&lt;ref name="time-cocacolaad"/&gt;&lt;ref name=independent-cocacolaad&gt;{{Cite web|title=A racist response?

=== Nationwide Insurance: "Boy" ===
At [[Super Bowl XLIX]] in 2015, after an eight-year hiatus, [[Nationwide Insurance]] returned to the game with two new advertisements.

Viewers and critics acknowledged that the subject matter of "Boy" was a major contrast to other, upbeat and comedic ads broadcast during Super Bowl XLIX (including Nationwide's second ad, "Invisible Mindy"). Reception towards the ad was overwhelmingly negative; viewers criticized the company via social media for its decision to broadcast an ad dealing with such subject matter during the Super Bowl, [[Amobee]] estimated only 12% of reactions to the ad on [[Twitter]] were positive, and it ranked near the bottom of the ''USA Today'' Ad Meter results. Nationwide CMO Matthew Jauchius defended the ad, noting that the negative response was "a little stronger than we anticipated", and that "Boy" was intended to "begin a dialogue to make safe happen for children everywhere."&lt;ref name=wsj-makesafehappen&gt;{{Cite web|title=Nationwide Knew Super Bowl Spot Would Touch a Nerve|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/02/02/nationwide-knew-super-bowl-spot-would-touch-a-nerve/|website=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=March 13, 2015|first=Nathalie|last=Tadena|date=February 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150319091900/http://blogs.wsj.com/cmo/2015/02/02/nationwide-knew-super-bowl-spot-would-touch-a-nerve/|archive-date=March 19, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cbf-nationwide&gt;{{Cite web|title=Nationwide defends Super Bowl ad|url=http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/blog/2015/02/nationwide-defends-that-super-bowl-ad.html|website=Columbus Business First|accessdate=March 13, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150311111150/http://www.bizjournals.com/columbus/blog/2015/02/nationwide-defends-that-super-bowl-ad.html|archive-date=March 11, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=nydn-makesafehappen&gt;{{Cite web|title=Nationwide's Super Bowl XLIX ad proves to be super bummer on social media|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/nationwide-super-bowl-ad-twitter-reaction-article-1.2099796|website=New York Daily News|accessdate=March 13, 2015|date=February 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150220004627/http://www.nydailynews.com/entertainment/gossip/nationwide-super-bowl-ad-twitter-reaction-article-1.2099796|archive-date=February 20, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jauchius later exited Nationwide two months after the advertisement aired.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/nationwide-cmo-departs-wake-dead-buy-super-bowl-ad/298485/|title=Nationwide CMO Exits in Wake of 'Dead Boy' Super Bowl Ad|access-date=2017-08-10|language=en|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170807165959/http://adage.com/article/cmo-strategy/nationwide-cmo-departs-wake-dead-buy-super-bowl-ad/298485/|archive-date=August 7, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== 84 Lumber: "The Journey" ===
Building supply company [[84 Lumber]] debuted at [[Super Bowl LI]] with "The Journey"; the ad depicted a mother and daughter migrating from [[Mexico]] to the United States border, only to discover that a [[border wall|wall]] had been built on it. However, after the daughter presented a handmade version of the U.S. flag that she had made with pieces of fabric collected along the way, the two discover a giant door in the wall.

The original version of the ad was rejected by Fox, as they believed that the border wall imagery was too politically sensitive in the wake of [[Donald Trump]]'s presidency, as his campaign promises included a plan to [[Mexico–United States barrier#Trump administration|build a wall across the entire southern border]].

=== GNC: "Courage to Change" ===
On January 31, 2017, it was reported that an advertisement for the health store chain [[GNC (store)|GNC]] had been rejected by the NFL for broadcast during Super Bowl LI. The ad had been rejected due to the company's inclusion on a list of "[[blacklist|prohibited companies]]" issued by the [[NFL Players Association]]; a small number of GNC's products contain [[Dehydroepiandrosterone|DHEA]] and [[Synephrine]], which are [[Steroid use in American football|performance-enhancing substances banned by the NFL]]. Inclusion on this list prohibits NFL players from promoting or endorsing the company. NFL policies do not allow advertising for “dietary or nutritional supplements that contain ingredients other than vitamins and minerals, energy drinks, or any prohibited substance”. Advertisements for health stores are not banned, provided that they do not reference such products. GNC's advertisement featured motivational themes as part of a larger "Courage to Change" marketing campaign, and did not make any references to specific products sold by the chain.&lt;ref name="usatoday-gnclawsuit"&gt;{{cite web|title=GNC's Super Bowl ad controversy escalates|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/super/2017/02/03/gnc-super-bowl-commercial-controversy-fox/97436046/|website=USA Today|accessdate=3 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170208002908/http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/nfl/super/2017/02/03/gnc-super-bowl-commercial-controversy-fox/97436046/|archive-date=February 8, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="wsj-nflbannedcompany"&gt;{{cite web|title=GNC’s Super Bowl Ad Rejected by NFL|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/gncs-super-bowl-ad-rejected-by-nfl-1485886063|website=The Wall Street Journal|accessdate=1 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170201152053/https://www.wsj.com/articles/gncs-super-bowl-ad-rejected-by-nfl-1485886063|archive-date=February 1, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday-gncban"&gt;{{cite web|title=Watch the GNC ad the NFL rejected from Super Bowl|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ad-meter/2017/01/31/gnc-ad-commercial-super-bowl-rejected/97275868/|website=USA Today|accessdate=1 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170223155317/http://www.usatoday.com/story/sports/ad-meter/2017/01/31/gnc-ad-commercial-super-bowl-rejected/97275868/|archive-date=February 23, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On February 2, 2017, it was reported that GNC had threatened to sue Fox over the rejection. The letter of intent stated that the contents of GNC's commercial had been "expressly approved" twice by Fox, and that the broadcaster did not inform GNC that ads broadcast during the Super Bowl were subject to approval by the NFL or any league policies. The company stated that Fox had "induced GNC to spend millions of dollars in production costs and in the development of a national, coordinated marketing and rebranding campaign centered around this advertisement."&lt;ref name="adage-gnclawsuit"&gt;{{cite web|title=GNC Intends to Sue Fox Over Rejected Super Bowl Spot|url=http://adage.com/article/agency-news/gnc-intends-sue-fox-rejected-super-bowl-spot/307829/|website=Advertising Age|accessdate=3 February 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170203140934/http://adage.com/article/agency-news/gnc-intends-sue-fox-rejected-super-bowl-spot/307829/|archive-date=February 3, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday-gnclawsuit"/&gt;

=== Ram Trucks: "Built to Serve" ===
In 2018 at [[Super Bowl LII]], Fiat Chrysler Automobiles marque [[Ram Trucks]] aired a commercial entitled "Built to Serve", as one of two Ram ads during the game. It featured an extract from the "Drum Major Instinct" sermon given by [[Martin Luther King Jr.]] on February 4, 1968 (exactly 50 years prior), wherein King explained the virtues of serving others. The speech was, in turn, set to footage of people using their Ram vehicles to help others.&lt;ref name="nyt-mlkad"/&gt;&lt;ref name="adweek-mlkad"/&gt;

The ad was largely criticized, as viewers considered it to be in bad taste for FCA to use the words of MLK to promote a product. It was also pointed out that, ironically, King had made comments criticizing the advertising industry during the same sermon. He described advertisers as being "gentlemen of massive verbal persuasion", explaining that "in order to be a man of distinction, you must drink this whiskey. In order to make your neighbors envious, you must drive this type of car. In order to be lovely to love you must wear this kind of lipstick or this kind of perfume. And you know, before you know it, you're just buying that stuff." William B. Wachtel, co-founder of the [[Drum Major Institute]], stated that "In a twist of irony, one of the specific evils Dr. King condemned was the exploitation of the drum major instinct by advertisers, particularly car advertisers".&lt;ref name="usatoday-mlkad"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/nation-now/2018/02/05/mlk-speech-used-rams-car-ad-goes-criticize-car-ads/306984002/|title=That Martin Luther King Jr. speech used in Ram's car ad?

Use of the speech was approved by [[Intellectual Properties Management]], the exclusive commercial licensor of King's estate. A representative of the organization stated that they approved the ad because its overall message "embodied Dr. King's philosophy that true greatness is achieved by serving others."&lt;ref name="adweek-mlkad"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.adweek.com/creativity/ram-gets-emotional-and-comical-in-a-pair-of-60-second-super-bowl-spots/|title=Ram Gets Emotional and Comical in a Pair of 60-Second Super Bowl Spots|work=Adweek|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180206131844/http://www.adweek.com/creativity/ram-gets-emotional-and-comical-in-a-pair-of-60-second-super-bowl-spots/|archive-date=February 6, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://variety.com/2018/tv/news/ram-trucks-martin-luther-king-advertising-super-bowl-1202687940/|title=Commercial Crash: Ram Trucks Ad With Martin Luther King Fails to Inspire|last=Steinberg|first=Brian|date=2018-02-05|work=Variety|access-date=2018-02-06|language=en-US|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180208131747/http://variety.com/2018/tv/news/ram-trucks-martin-luther-king-advertising-super-bowl-1202687940/|archive-date=February 8, 2018|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="usatoday-mlkad"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt-mlkad"/&gt; Although the [[King Center for Nonviolent Social Change|King Center]] distanced itself from the ad by stating that it was not responsible for its licensing, it was pointed out that Intellectual Properties Management was based within the facilities of the King Center to begin with, and thus had close ties to the family.

== Internationally ==
The Super Bowl commercials are generally limited to the American television broadcast of the game. This prevents international viewers from watching the game with these often iconic commercials. Online postings of the commercials on sites such as [[YouTube]] have partially alleviated the issue,&lt;ref name="torstar-spike"/&gt;&lt;ref name="tgam-2012"/&gt; while NBC posted the [[Super Bowl XLIX]] commercials on a [[Tumblr]] blog as they aired during the game for the benefit of its U.S. online stream (which did not contain all of the same ads as the television feed).&lt;ref name=variety-superbowltumblr&gt;{{Cite web|title=Super Bowl Ads: NBC Turns to Tumblr to Post Spots After They Air on TV|url=https://variety.com/2015/digital/news/super-bowl-ads-nbc-turns-to-tumblr-to-post-spots-after-airing-on-tv-1201410862/|website=Variety|accessdate=January 29, 2015|first=Todd|last=Spangler|date=January 21, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150129193325/http://variety.com/2015/digital/news/super-bowl-ads-nbc-turns-to-tumblr-to-post-spots-after-airing-on-tv-1201410862/|archive-date=January 29, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Complaints about the U.S. Super Bowl ads are common in Canada; although U.S. network affiliates are widely available on pay television providers in the country, "[[simultaneous substitution]]" regulations give Canadian television networks the right to request that a U.S. feed of a program be replaced with its Canadian counterpart on these providers if it is airing a program in [[simulcast]] with a U.S. network. This rule is intended to protect the investments of Canadian broadcasters in exclusive domestic broadcast rights, and also protect Canadian advertisers who had purchased their own advertising time on the Canadian network. As a result, most American Super Bowl ads are effectively "blacked out" by the Canadian broadcaster.&lt;ref name="torstar-spike"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/companies/article/931746--demand-for-super-bowl-ads-spikes-in-canada|title=Demand for Super Bowl ads spikes in Canada|first=Dana|last=Flavelle|work=[[Toronto Star]]|date=February 1, 2010|accessdate=February 5, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110205001727/http://www.thestar.com/business/companies/article/931746--demand-for-super-bowl-ads-spikes-in-canada|archive-date=February 5, 2011|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="tgam-2012"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/marketing/adhocracy/why-most-super-bowl-ads-get-stopped-at-the-border/article2324816/singlepage/|title=Why most Super Bowl ads get stopped at the border|first=Susan|last=Krashinsky|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=February 3, 2011|accessdate=February 4, 2011|location=Toronto|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120206050113/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/marketing/adhocracy/why-most-super-bowl-ads-get-stopped-at-the-border/article2324816/singlepage/|archive-date=February 6, 2012|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.montrealgazette.com/business/turfed+from+simulcast/4222338/story.html|title=Funny U.S. ads turfed on CTV's Super Bowl simulcast: HD broadcast overrides Fox's on cable, replacing U.S. commercials with Canadian|first=Brendan|last=Kelly|work=[[The Gazette (Montreal)]]|date=February 4, 2010|accessdate=February 5, 2010|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110207052344/http://www.montrealgazette.com/business/turfed+from+simulcast/4222338/story.html|archive-date=February 7, 2011|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members of Parliament [[Bob Nault]] and [[Wayne Easter]] have stated that the [[Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission]] (CRTC), Canada's telecom regulator, has only received around 100 specific complaints about Super Bowl ads in relation to the simsub rules.&lt;ref name="torstar-complaints"&gt;{{cite web|title=Canadian MPs say CRTC made a bad call on Super Bowl ads|url=https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/12/15/canadian-mps-say-crtc-made-a-bad-call-on-super-bowl-ads.html|website=Toronto Star|accessdate=18 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118215613/https://www.thestar.com/business/2016/12/15/canadian-mps-say-crtc-made-a-bad-call-on-super-bowl-ads.html|archive-date=January 18, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some U.S.-based advertisers, particularly [[PepsiCo]] and [[Anheuser-Busch]] (via its Canadian subsidiary [[Labatt]]), do buy ad time during the Canadian broadcast on [[CTV Television|CTV]], owned by [[Bell Media]]—the broadcasting subsidiary of Canadian telecommunications firm [[BCE]] and the current rightsholder of the game, to air at least some of their American commercials, but many Canadian advertisers simply re-air ads from their regular rotation, or air the same ad multiple times over the course of the game, neither of which is typical during the U.S. network broadcast.&lt;ref name="tgam-2012" /&gt; Reasons cited by Canadian advertisers for these practices include the additional talent and post-production fees that would be required to broadcast the American ads in Canada, and the perceived lower "cultural resonance" of the game for Canadian viewers as opposed to Americans.&lt;ref name="tgam-2012" /&gt; As such, and because Canada's population is approximately a tenth of the United States', advertising time costs a fraction of the price to air an ad on the U.S. broadcast: prices ranged between $170,000 to $200,000 for a 30-second slot on CTV's telecast of [[Super Bowl XLIX]].&lt;ref name=gandm-bbad/&gt;&lt;ref name=gandm-nomoresuperbowlsimsub/&gt;

On the other hand, in the 2010s, there were a growing number of Super Bowl ads produced specifically for the Canadian broadcast: [[Hyundai]]'s Canadian subsidiary began airing its own Super Bowl ads in 2010,&lt;ref name=marketing-hyundaigaspocalypse&gt;{{cite web|title=Hyundai Goes Apocalyptic for Super Bowl|url=http://www.marketingmag.ca/brands/hyundai-goes-apocalyptic-on-super-bowl-broadcast-70745|website=Marketing Magazine|accessdate=February 1, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402095138/http://www.marketingmag.ca/brands/hyundai-goes-apocalyptic-on-super-bowl-broadcast-70745|archive-date=April 2, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Budweiser produced the [[ice hockey|hockey]]-themed  "Flash Fans" to air during the Canadian broadcast of [[Super Bowl XLVI]]. The following year, two Canadian companies—[[BlackBerry Limited|BlackBerry]] and [[Gildan Activewear]], made their debut as U.S. Super Bowl advertisers; their ads were also broadcast in Canada alongside those by [[McDonald's Canada]], who debuted its "Our Food.

=== Canadian simsub ban ===
On January 29, 2015, the CRTC announced a proposal to forbid the invocation of simultaneous substitution on the Super Bowl telecast, thus allowing U.S. feeds of the event to co-exist with those of Canadian rightsholders on pay television providers. The decision came as a result of a series of hearings held by the CRTC known as ''Let's Talk TV'', which explored reforms of the Canadian television industry: the Commission cited viewer frustration over the use of simsubs, especially surrounding the Super Bowl, and argued that the commercials were an "integral part" of the game due to their cultural significance.&lt;ref name=gandm-nomoresuperbowlsimsub&gt;{{Cite web|title=CRTC opens door for U.S. Super Bowl ads to air on Canadian TV|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/marketing/crtc-opens-door-for-us-super-bowl-ads-to-air-on-canadian-tv/article22696212/|accessdate=January 29, 2015|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|date=January 29, 2015|location=Toronto|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150201031352/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/industry-news/marketing/crtc-opens-door-for-us-super-bowl-ads-to-air-on-canadian-tv/article22696212/|archive-date=February 1, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=crtc-2015-25&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Regulatory Policy CRTC 2015-25|url=http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2015/2015-25.htm|publisher=CRTC|accessdate=February 3, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150203074901/http://www.crtc.gc.ca/eng/archive/2015/2015-25.htm|archive-date=February 3, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2015, Bell filed an appeal against this decision, arguing that the move would devalue its exclusive broadcast rights to the game, and violated the [[Broadcasting Act (1991)|Broadcasting Act]], which forbids the "making of regulations singling out a particular program or licensee."&lt;ref name=gandm-bellappeal&gt;{{Cite web|title=Bell appeals CRTC decision to air U.S. Super Bowl commercials|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/bell-to-fight-crtc-ruling-on-super-bowl-simsub/article23244271/|accessdate=March 12, 2015|work=[[The Globe and Mail]]|location=Toronto|date=March 2, 2015|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150309142710/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/bell-to-fight-crtc-ruling-on-super-bowl-simsub/article23244271/|archive-date=March 9, 2015|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; A report commissioned by Bell estimated that without this lucrative exclusivity, it would lose about US$13.6 million per-year.&lt;ref name="bloomberg-blitzes"/&gt;

On September 6, 2016, the [[Federal Court of Appeal (Canada)|Federal Court of Appeal]] dismissed Bell Media's lawsuit for being premature, because it was filed before the CRTC had formally implemented the rules.&lt;ref name="gandm-yesnoads"&gt;{{cite web|title=Court dismisses Bell appeal of CRTC policy on Super Bowl ads|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/court-rules-against-bells-attempt-to-swap-super-bowl-commercials/article31722299/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=12 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503231636/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/court-rules-against-bells-attempt-to-swap-super-bowl-commercials/article31722299/|archive-date=May 3, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="cbc-lawsuitdismiss"&gt;{{cite web|title=Court rules against Bell in bid to overturn ban on U.S. ads airing during Super Bowl|url=http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/crtc-super-bowl-ads-appeal-1.3751203|website=CBC News|accessdate=12 September 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160908205129/http://www.cbc.ca/news/business/crtc-super-bowl-ads-appeal-1.3751203|archive-date=September 8, 2016|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; On November 2, 2016, Bell was granted an appeal.&lt;ref name="gandm-bellappeal 2"&gt;{{cite web|title=Bell wins right to appeal new Super Bowl ad policy|url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/bell-wins-right-to-appeal-new-super-bowl-ad-policy/article32643801/|website=The Globe and Mail|accessdate=2 November 2016|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170503231633/http://www.theglobeandmail.com/report-on-business/bell-wins-right-to-appeal-new-super-bowl-ad-policy/article32643801/|archive-date=May 3, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the lead-up to [[Super Bowl LI]] (which would be the first game to fall under this policy), a number of stakeholders, including the NFL, Bell Media, local unions. as well as politicians from both Canada and the U.S., called upon the CRTC to reverse the ruling. U.S. senators [[Marco Rubio]] and [[Ron Johnson (Wisconsin politician)|Ron Johnson]] wrote to an ambassador that the CRTC's decision "sends a troubling signal about the value Canada places on its largest trading partner, best customer and close friend." Bell had also urged prime minister [[Justin Trudeau]] to invoke section 26(2) of the [[Broadcasting Act (1991)|Broadcasting Act]] (which grants the government power to require the broadcasting of programming that is "of urgent importance to Canadians", and had only been invoked once before to mandate the broadcast of a major speech by a Prime Minister) to override the CRTC policy and still require that the Super Bowl LI telecast be subject to simsub.&lt;ref name="bloomberg-blitzes"&gt;{{cite web|title=NFL Blitzes Trudeau in Arcane Super Bowl Advertising Dispute|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-09/nfl-blitzes-trudeau-in-arcane-super-bowl-advertising-dispute|website=Bloomberg L.P.|accessdate=18 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118141116/https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2017-01-09/nfl-blitzes-trudeau-in-arcane-super-bowl-advertising-dispute|archive-date=January 18, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broadcasting Act|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-9.01/page-5.html#docCont|publisher=Government of Canada|accessdate=18 January 2017|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170118140027/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/B-9.01/page-5.html#docCont#docCont|archive-date=January 18, 2017|dead-url=no|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Swiebertje''' is a character from the books of Dutch author [[John Henri uit den Bogaard]], who wrote a series of children's books based on the character from 1936 to 1974. The books were adapted for television ([[Joop Doderer]] playing the title role), in a series of shows which aired on [[NCRV]] in the 1960s and 1970s, one of the longest-running and most popular shows in Dutch TV history.

==Character and adventures==
The character Swiebertje is a tramp, and is supposed to be inspired by a drawing by [[Tjeerd Bottema]]. He is a "lovable vagabond", and his character as well as the TV show "present a comforting image of a simple rural past".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lechner|first=Frank J.|title=The Netherlands: Globalization and National Identity|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4geRyL5imswC&amp;pg=PT221|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135907709|page=221}}&lt;/ref&gt; His wanderings, during which he typically got in trouble but always found a happy ending, evoked romanticism and adventure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Geelen|first=R.|title=Praktijkboek Dementiezorg|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=K0oxLB4Zbz0C&amp;pg=PA302|year=2012|publisher=Bohn Stafleu van Loghum|language=Dutch|isbn=9789031385683|page=302}}&lt;/ref&gt; The "innocent" show was the second-most popular show among children in 1966; the most popular was the more adult program ''[[Bonanza]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Noordman|first1=Joannes Maria Antonius|last2=Rietveld-van Wingerden|first2=Marjoke|last3=Bakker|first3=Petronella Catharina Maria|title=Vijf eeuwen opvoeden in Nederland|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=mT9CrHjhTnUC&amp;pg=PA344|year=2010|publisher=Van Gorcum|language=Dutch|isbn=9789023246138|page=344|chapter=Opvoeding en zorg in 'de eeuw van het kind'}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Regular characters included, besides Swiebertje, the police officer Bromsnor ([[Lou Geels]]), housekeeper Saartje ([[Riek Schagen]]), and shopkeeper Malle Pietje ([[Piet Ekel]]).&lt;ref name="oosterwijk"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.telegraaf.nl/prive/article20644801.ece|title='Malle Pietje' haalt herinneringen aan Swiebertje op|last=Oosterwijk|first=Mariët|date=20 July 2008|work=[[De Telegraaf]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=20 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Joop Doderer==
On TV, he was played by [[Joop Doderer]], who became so identified with the part that the Dutch expression for the most extreme form of  [[Typecasting (acting)|typecasting]], where an actor is identified with just one single character, is called the ''Swiebertje-effect''. [[Oudewater]] has a Swiebertje statue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=ANWB Reisgids NL, Utrecht|language=Dutch|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Qe9PWlbNfxMC&amp;pg=PA97|year=2006|publisher=[[Royal Dutch Touring Club]]|isbn=9789018023102|page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; Doderer played Swiebertje for seventeen years and grew to dislike the character. After the show had run its course, in 1975, he was unable to find serious roles because he was so much identified with Swiebertje; he left for England, where playing roles in high-quality television drama proved a relief. He returned to the Netherlands, and to the stage, and later made peace with the character, saying that Swiebertje derived its popularity from his [[everyman]]-qualities.&lt;ref name="iedereen"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.volkskrant.nl/vk/nl/2676/Cultuur/article/detail/667718/2005/09/23/Swiebertje-was-een-man-van-iedereen.dhtml|title=Swiebertje was een man van iedereen|last=Ockhuysen|first=Ronald|date=23 September 2005|work=[[de Volkskrant]]|language=Dutch|accessdate=19 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Mistress of the World''''' ({{lang-de|'''Die Herrin der Welt'''}}) is an eight-part 1919 [[silent film]] made in the [[Weimar Republic]] starring [[Mia May]] in the lead role. The film, under the creative control of director [[Joe May]], is noted for bringing together talent from across German cinema, including many who would work behind the camera during the emergence of [[German Expressionism|German Expressionist]] cinema.

The story follows a young Danish woman on her globe-trotting adventures to find the legendary lost treasure of the [[Queen of Sheba]] that she hopes will enable her to bring revenge on the man that drew her father to commit [[suicide]] and led to her own social destruction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yqRNiYpofMcC&amp;pg=PA57&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;dq=%22Mistress+of+the+World%22+1919&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=58wNkxKu9A&amp;sig=P00iOTt9VE1pkoVsfnGthiZ2XCk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=hpMTU9ixFsnBhAe-y4GoDQ&amp;ved=0CF0Q6AEwCQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Mistress%20of%20the%20World%22%201919&amp;f=false|title=Thrillers|first=Martin|last=Rubin|year=1999|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=57|isbn=9780521588393}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first film was released in Germany on 5 December 1919, and this was followed each week by the release of the subsequent episodes.&lt;ref&gt;Halle, McCarthy (2003), p.15&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
===Part 1, The Girlfriend of the Yellow Man===
{{lang-de|Die Herrin der Welt 1. Teil &amp;ndash; Die Freundin des gelben Mannes}}

Young Danish adventuress Maud Gregaards ([[Mia May]]) answers an  advertisement to take up a position as a governess in [[Republic of China (1912–49)|China]]. There, she falls victim to the [[Forced prostitution|white slave]]-trade and is placed in a brothel. She is freed by her travel companion, Dr. Kien-Lung ([[Henry Sze]]), but the physician is then kidnapped by the devilish Hai-Fung, who also captures and tortures Maud. Chinese consul Madsen ([[Michael Bohnen]]) releases both Dr. Kein-Lung and Maud from the clutches of Hai-Fung. It is later revealed that Maud is harbouring a secret plot of revenge that brought her to China. Maud decides to tell her two trusted companions what that secret is.

===Part 2, The Race for Life===
{{lang-de|Die Geschichte der Maud Gregaards}}

The second part of this film is a prequel to the first part. Maud explains to her companions why she travelled to China. Maud's father was an archivist at the Foreign Office in [[Denmark]]. There he was blackmailed to hand over a Chinese secret agreement. Unable either to face the blackmailers or to betray his country, he commits suicide. Maud later falls in love with Baron Murphy ([[Hans Mierendorff]]) for whom she works as a translator, and they become engaged. Unknowingly, Maud translates the Chinese document for the Baron, after which he takes the secret and flees the country, leaving Maud to be arrested as a spy. In jail, Maud gives birth to the Baron's child but the baby dies in prison. On being released from jail, Maud comes into the possession of information about the rabbi of Kuan-Fu, who is said to have knowledge of the hidden treasure of the [[Queen of Sheba]]. She decides to travel to China to find the treasure which she hopes will allow her to take revenge on her former lover.&lt;ref&gt;Ashkenazi (2012), p.123&lt;/ref&gt;

===Part 3, The City of Gold===
{{lang-de|Der Rabbi von Kuan-Fu}}

Maud Gregaards, Kien-Lung and Consul Madsen travel together to find the rabbi of Kuan-Fu, the last surviving member of an ancient Jewish settlement in [[Guangzhou|Canton]], who is said to be in possession of the secret to the fabled treasure of the Queen of Sheba.&lt;ref name="Halle18"&gt;Halle, McCarthy (2003), p.18&lt;/ref&gt; The three companions enter the ancient ruins where the rabbi is believed to live, watched suspiciously by the local natives. On finding the old rabbi, Madsen reveals that he is Jewish and gains the trust of the holy man.&lt;ref name="Halle18"/&gt; They are entrusted with the Gem of [[Astarte]], which was once given to King [[Solomon]] by the Queen of Sheba, and within it the map to the treasure. Before he can reveal any further information the rabbi dies. On leaving the ruins Madsen is injured fighting with the natives, and is abandoned by Kien-Lung; the Gem of Astarte is briefly lost in the same encounter. As Madsen meets back up with Kien-Lung, a fight breaks out between the two men, only Maud's intervention separates the two.

===Part 4, King Macombe===
{{lang-de| König Macombe}}

Maud, along with, Madsen and Kien-Lung, adventure into [[Central Africa]], to search for the biblical city of [[Ophir]] where the treasure lies. There they enter the realm of King Makombe, at the heart of the Cult of Astarte. The tribe's Medicine Man ([[Louis Brody]]) steals the Gem of Astarte to appease the natives against the invaders. Maud, Madsen and Dr. Kien-Lung flee but during the escape Kien-Lung is struck by a [[poisoned arrow]] and dies. Maud and Madsen find shelter in a cave, where they are hidden from their pursuers. In the final scene, Maud and Madsen reach the gates of Ophir.

===Part 5, Ophir, City of the Past ===
[[File:Mia May, The Mistress of the World.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Mia May as the embodiment of the goddess Astarte in Part V]]
{{lang-de|Teil &amp;ndash; Ophir, die Stadt der Vergangenheit}}

Maud and Madsen eventually find the City of Ophir, but are discovered in the treasury of the Queen of Sheba and are captured as intruders. Maud is to be sacrificed because she had desecrated the sacred ground of the city. Madsen is sent to the slave city of Sabyten, where he is to suffer life as a slave. As Maud is laid on the sacrificial altar, the high priest sees she wears the necklace of Astarte, and Maud is declared as the reincarnation of the goddess, whose return had been predicted. Madsen escapes from captivity with the help of an American engineer, Allan Stanley ([[Paul Hansen (tenor)|Paul Hansen]]), whom he met in the slave city, and returns to rescue Maud. The three find the treasure and manage to telegraph the outside world for help. An American expedition hears their plea and sends a plane to rescue all three, but Madsen is killed in the escape. As they fly from the city an earthquake leaves the mysterious City of Ophir in ruins.

===Part 6, The Woman with the Billions===
{{lang-de|Teil &amp;ndash; Die Frau mit den Milliarden}}

Maud Gregaards, now incredibly rich, seeks out a new life, and under the name Maud Fergusson, settles in the [[United States]]. The American newspaper publisher, Fletcher, who sent the rescuing aircraft to Ophir, turns her story into headline news, making Maud a celebrity. This story is attacked by a rival newspaper, ''Harrison's Universe'', run by Hannibal Harrison ([[Wilhelm Diegelmann]]), declaring the whole adventure a fantasy. Both tabloids are reduced to a war over Maud, while a theater agent, Karpeles ([[Paul Morgan (actor)|Paul Morgan]]), makes a film about Maud's adventure. Although little more than fabrication, the movie makes her a superstar. Meanwhile, Maud and Allan fall in love and leave for [[Europe]].

===Part 7: The Benefactress of Mankind===
{{lang-de|Teil &amp;ndash; Die Wohltäterin der Menschheit}}

The billionaire Maud Fergusson, attempts to start a new life with Allan Stanley. The wealth gained from the Queen of Sheba's treasure allows the "Mistress of the World" to live a carefree life in [[Denmark]] and the two plan to marry. Stanley insists that before they marry that Maud tells him the name of the man who is responsible for all her misfortunes. Maud, however, has put her past behind her and just wants to find peace. She plans to become a benefactor of mankind, sponsoring research and technology projects with their billions. Allan, meanwhile, develops a remote fusion machine that can melt metal. Since guns can be destroyed with this powerful invention, he soon falls into the sights of ruthless weapon manufacturers that want to stop its production. On the day of the invention's first public demonstration, there is a huge explosion, caused by Maud's nemesis Baron Murphy. Allan is killed in the explosion.

===Part 8: The Revenge of Maud Fergusson===
{{lang-de|Teil &amp;ndash; Die Rache der Maud Fergusson}}

The death of Allan, shortly before their wedding, sends Maud on a quest for bloody revenge. Helped by a detective, Hunt, ([[Rudolf Lettinger]]), Maud discovers that Baron Murphy is behind her fiancé's death and sparks a newspaper campaign against the Baron to expose him. Murphy loses his entire fortune and is forced to leave the country and dies while desperately battling through a snowstorm. Hunt also discovers that a young academic Credo Merville ([[Ernst Hofmann]]) is Murphy and Maud's son, who is supposed to have died shortly after his birth. In the end, mother and son fall into each other's arms.

==Development==
===Production===
Austrian film producer [[Joe May]] conceived the idea for filming ''The Mistress of the World'', which he loosely based on the novel ''Die Herrin der Welt'' by author [[Karl Figdor]], in early 1919.&lt;ref&gt;Ashkenazi (2012), p.116&lt;/ref&gt; May produced ''The Mistress of the World'' as a [[serial film]], which Carjels argues was more influenced by the French serials of the time rather than the American 'cliff-hanger' serials.&lt;ref name="Carjels63-64"&gt;Carjels (2011), pp.63-64&lt;/ref&gt; Whereas the popular American serials were filmed over two reels, making them short openers to a [[feature film]], each part of ''The Mistress of the World'' was shot over six reels, making them feature length.&lt;ref name="Carjels63-64"/&gt; Another difference to the American serials was the lack of a cliffhanger ending. Each episode of ''Mistress'' was a self-contained story, but the end goal was still out of reach, drawing audiences back to find out how the story resolved rather than how the heroine escaped a dangerous situation.&lt;ref name="Carjels63-64"/&gt;

Normal prerelease hype for serials was often manufactured through movie tie-ins, serialization in other media and spot prizes given to audience members.&lt;ref name="Carjels63-64"/&gt; May attempted a different approach for ''The Mistress of the World'', which at first appeared to be meager in comparison. He instead released a steady stream of information regarding the production of the film, which included stories around the film's stars, the set design and the process of making the film. This in turn led to massive audience anticipation, making ''The Mistress of the World'' one of the first ''[[epic film|Monumentalfilm]]'', and this promotional technique was embraced by other productions that followed.&lt;ref name="Carjels63-64"/&gt; May continued to feed the entertainment journals with facts from the film in the run up to its release, in an attempt to promote the enormity of the film: a 2,000 page script, 200 days of exterior filming and 150 days of interior filming.&lt;ref name="Carjels65"&gt;Carjels (2011) p.65&lt;/ref&gt; A set was created at [[Woltersdorf, Brandenburg|Woltersdorf]] in Germany where a crew of 30,000 people fed by 100 cooks were utilised over the entire shoot and by the end of the production the film had cost six million Marks.&lt;ref name="Carjels65"/&gt; This steady stream of figures resulted in the series being described as "a completely new film experience", and even without the story being unveiled May had given ''The Mistress of the World'' a feeling of importance and gravitas.&lt;ref name="Carjels65"/&gt;

As well as starring many stars of Weimar cinema, ''The Mistress of the World'' is also notable for bringing together many of the most important writers and production and set designers of early German Expressionism. Of note in parts II and III, acting as Assistant director, was [[Fritz Lang]], who also acted as a script writer in part VIII. Working in the role of set and production design were [[Otto Hunte]], [[Martin Jacoby-Boy]], [[Erich Kettelhut]] and [[Karl Vollbrecht]], all of whom would work in the years following with Lang on many of his iconic German films setting the tone of German Expressionist films in such classics as ''[[Dr. Mabuse the Gambler]]'' (1922), ''[[Die Nibelungen]]'' (1924) and ''[[Metropolis (1927 film)|Metropolis]]'' (1926).

==Reception==
===Europe===
The first part of ''The Mistress of the World'' was premiered on 5 December 1919 at the Tauentzienpalast in Berlin, along with other high-end cinemas.&lt;ref name="Carjels68-69"&gt;Carjels (2011) pp.68-69&lt;/ref&gt; The Tauentzienpalast was redecorated for the premier and the audience found themselves surrounded by tropical trees and bushes in an attempt to transport them to the exotic world of the film. Men dressed in Chinese servant uniforms handed out souvenirs, and large tapestries hung from the walls.&lt;ref name="Carjels68-69"/&gt;

Initial reviews to the film were very positive. ''Die illustrierte Filmwoche'' noted how no other film had created such anticipation and disappointed so little. ''Die Kinematograph'' saw it as a masterpiece of German film-making skill, while ''Der Film'' believed that "it will win over foreign markets".&lt;ref name="Carjels70"&gt;Carjels (2011) p.70&lt;/ref&gt; The more independent cultural publications were less positive, ''[[Berliner Börsen-Courier]]'' wrote that the serial did not rise above the average feature and that it lacked a sense of greatness, strength and depth.&lt;ref name="Carjels70"/&gt; George Gottholt, writing in the ''Freie Deutsche Bühne'', was very negative in his views, stating "This film, and others like, it have a vulgarizing effect on the taste and a dumbing-down effect on the intellect of its audience."&lt;ref name="Carjels71"&gt;Carjels (2011) p.71&lt;/ref&gt; Carjels compares ''The Mistress of the World'' to a modern globe-trotting adventure story more akin to an [[Indiana Jones]] or [[Lara Croft]] film, rather than a more intellect take such as ''[[Madame Dubarry]]''.&lt;ref name="Carjels71"/&gt;

Although receiving mixed reviews, the public responded positively and ''The Mistress of the World'' was the most commercially successful German film of the 1919-1920 season, outstripping ''[[The Cabinet of Dr. Caligari]]'' (1920) in popular appeal.&lt;ref&gt;Halle, McCarthy (2003), p.14&lt;/ref&gt;

===United States===
''The Mistress of the World'' was released in the United States in 1922 by [[Paramount Pictures]] but was shortened and re-edited into four films, spanning twenty reels, the result of which was that half of the eight films were removed.&lt;ref name="Carjels127"&gt;Carjels (2011) p.127&lt;/ref&gt; The four films were titled: Number 1. ''The Dragon's Claw'', Number 2. ''The Race for Life'', Number 3. ''The City of Gold'' and Number 4. ''Saved by Wireless''.&lt;ref name="Carjels128"&gt;Carjels (2011) p.128&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Robert Kane (producer)|Robert Kane]], who oversaw the editing process for Paramount, it took four months to recut and give the film a more 'American Tempo'.&lt;ref name="Carjels127"/&gt; The Paramount series only followed the events of the original story up until the end of part 5, not following the heroine's return to New York and her ultimate revenge.

Whereas the original series of films were intended to be a mix of adventure, melodrama and comedy, the American edit was created to concentrate on the action. This was reflected in the promotional campaign with 11 of the 13 posters offered to the exhibitors, showing fight scenes or daredevil acts, similar to those used in American serials.&lt;ref name="Carjels130"&gt;Carjels (2011) p.130&lt;/ref&gt;

==1960 film==
In 1960 [[CCC Films]] released a two part ''[[Mistress of the World]]'' feature film directed by [[William Dieterle]] starring [[Martha Hyer]] as Karin Fergusson.

'''''The Osmonds''''' is a 1972 [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC-TV]] Saturday morning cartoon series produced by [[Rankin/Bass Productions]] starring the [[The Osmonds|Osmond Brothers]]. Each episode features the family in a different location around the world, with young [[Jimmy Osmond|Jimmy's]] antics usually driving the plot of the episode. As with most television series oriented around bands, the Osmonds' songs were featured prominently in the series. The series featured Jimmy's pet dog named Fuji, with a speaking mind of its own. [[Marie Osmond]] did not appear in the series, as she would not make her performing debut until 1973.  An abridged version of "One Bad Apple" was used for the opening of the show, while a brief instrumental version of the same song was used for the end credits.

Like ''[[The Jackson 5ive (TV series)|The Jackson 5ive]]'', it used an [[laugh track]] created by [[Rankin/Bass]].&lt;ref&gt;Iverson, Paul R. (February 1994, rev. December 2012), The Advent of the Laugh Track (2nd ed.), Hempstead, New York: Hofstra University Archives Check date values in: |date= (help)&lt;/ref&gt;  Unlike the Jacksons, the Osmond brothers provided their own speaking voices in their series.

==Episodes==
Each episode features one song by The Osmonds and one solo song by either Donny or Jimmy.  Songs are followed by their album inclusions.
