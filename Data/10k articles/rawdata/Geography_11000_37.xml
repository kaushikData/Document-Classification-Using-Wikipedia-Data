'''Abu Ageila''' is a strategically important [[road junction]] and [[dam]] in the north of the [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] peninsula, because of its proximity to the border with Israel, approximately 25&amp;nbsp;km from [[Auja al-Hafir]] and 45&amp;nbsp;km southeast of [[El Arish]]. It was the site of major battles in the [[Battles of the Sinai (1948)|1948]], [[Suez Crisis#The Hedgehog-Abu Uwayulah operations|1956]] and [[Battle of Abu-Ageila (1967)|1967]] wars between [[Israel]] and [[Egypt]]. The adjacent location Umm Katef ({{lang-ar|أم كاتف}}) was another key Egyptian position in the Abu Ageila battles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gawrych|first1=G.W.|title=Key To The Sinai: The Battles For Abu Agelia In The 1956 And 1967 Arab Israeli Wars [Illustrated Edition]|date=2014|publisher=Pickle Partners Publishing|isbn=9781782895794|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uJNvCwAAQBAJ|accessdate=22 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a recent biography of [[Ariel Sharon]] by David Landau, in preparation for an attack on the Suez Canal were war to break out between Israel and Egypt, Sharon ordered the secret expulsion of 3,000 Bedouin from Abu Ageila, in late January 1972, to clear the way for a military exercise code-named ''Oz'' (valour). No warning was given, and the expulsion order was executed during the onset of freezing temperatures in the desert, over three days. Moreover, no time was allowed for the Bedouin (nomadic tribes) - the [['Azazme]], kin to the [[Tarabin bedouin|Tarabin]] in El Arish&lt;ref name="Negev Townships"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Chatty|first1=Dawn|authorlink=Dawn Chatty|title=Nomadic Societies in the Middle East And North Africa: Entering the 21st Century|date=2006|publisher=Brill|isbn=9789004147928|page=905|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JzqIpRZAvdEC&amp;pg=PA768&amp;dq=Azazme&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiHmo7q9rzQAhUHUSYKHYgwBUQQ6AEIHzAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Azazme&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; - to collect their belongings. As a result, some forty died, predominantly children, babies and old people, as they were forced to relocate to Gabal Khalal mountain. Israeli IDF members associated with the expulsion said later that Sharon probably intended to use the land for an Israeli settlement. Lt. Gen. [[David Elazar]] later ordered that the Bedouin be allowed to return.&lt;ref&gt;Anshel Pfeffer, [http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.573778 'Sharon ordered expulsion of 3,000 Bedouin, new biography reveals ,'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140213180815/http://www.haaretz.com/news/diplomacy-defense/.premium-1.573778 |date=2014-02-13 }} at Haaretz, 11 February 2014&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Politics of Taiwan}}
The '''administrative divisions of [[Taiwan]]''', officially the Republic of China, consists of provinces&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1465&amp;CtNode=1347 | work=Taiwan Review | title=Gone with the Times | date=October 1999 | accessdate=2012-01-11 | last=Hwang | first=Jim | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120226030251/http://taiwanreview.nat.gov.tw/ct.asp?xItem=1465&amp;CtNode=1347 | archivedate=2012-02-26 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipalities]]. The provinces are "streamlined" and no longer functional.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tpg.gov.tw/|title=Taiwan Provincial Government Official Website|accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Each province is, however, subdivided into [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|cities]] and [[County (Taiwan)|counties]]. There are 6 [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipalities]] ([[Kaohsiung]], [[New Taipei]], [[Taichung]], [[Tainan]], [[Taipei]] and [[Taoyuan, Taiwan|Taoyuan]]), 3 [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|cities]] ([[Chiayi]], [[Hsinchu]] and [[Keelung]]) and 13 [[County (Taiwan)|counties]].

==History==
{{see also|Political divisions of Taiwan (1895–1945)|History of the administrative divisions of China (1912–49)}}

===Territory===
In 1945, after the [[World War II]], the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]] acquired Taiwan (Formosa) and [[Penghu]] (the Pescadores) from the [[Empire of Japan]]. In 1949, the [[government of the Republic of China]] led by the [[Kuomintang]] lost the [[Chinese Civil War]] and retreated to [[Taipei]], [[Taiwan]]. The government lost almost all its jurisdiction over [[mainland China]], with only some [[List of islands of Taiwan|offshore islands]] remaining. This history gives two different sources of the current Taiwanese administrative divisions on the [[Free area of the Republic of China]] or Taiwan Area.
* The island of Taiwan (Formosa) and [[Penghu]] (the Pescadores): inherited from the divisions of [[Taiwan under Japanese rule|Taiwan]] under the [[Empire of Japan]].
* [[Kinmen]] (Quemoy) and the [[Matsu Islands]]: inherited from the divisions of [[mainland China]] under the [[Republic of China (1912–49)|Republic of China]].

===Changes to divisions===
Since 1949, the government has made some changes in the area under its control. The two provincial governments were streamlined and much of their functions transferred to the central or county governments. Six [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipalities]] have been created on the territory belonged to [[Taiwan Province]].

Since 1949, the most controversial part of the political division system has been the existence of [[Taiwan Province]], as its existence was part of a larger controversy over the [[political status of Taiwan]]. Since 1998, most of the duties and powers of [[Taiwan Provincial Government]] have been transferred to the [[government of the Republic of China|central government]], through amendments to the constitution. The much smaller [[Fujian Province, Republic of China|Fukien province]], [[Fujian Provincial Government]] has been in streamlined form since 1956.

There has been some criticism of the current administrative scheme as being inefficient and not conducive to regional planning. In particular, most of the administrative cities are much smaller than the actual metropolitan areas, and there are no formal means for coordinating policy between an administrative city and its surrounding areas.

Before 2008, the likelihood of consolidation was low. Many of the cities had political demographics which were very different from their surrounding counties, making the prospect of consolidation highly politically charged. For example, while the [[Kuomintang]] argued that combining [[Taipei City]], [[Taipei County]], and [[Keelung City]] into a metropolitan Taipei region would allow for better regional planning, the [[Democratic Progressive Party]] argued that this was merely an excuse to eliminate the government of Taipei County, which it had at times controlled, by swamping it with votes from [[Taipei City]] and [[Keelung City]], which tended to vote Kuomintang.

On 1 October 2007, Taipei County was upgraded to a quasi-municipality ({{lang|zh-hant|準直轄市}}) on the same level as Kaohsiung City and Taipei City.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://web.ner.gov.tw/culturenews/culture/culture-detail.asp?id=84927 |work= 國立教育廣播電台新聞 |access-date= 2016-07-04 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080127040144/http://web.ner.gov.tw/culturenews/culture/culture-detail.asp?id=84927    |date= 2007-10-01 |script-title=zh:歷時28年 臺北縣今升格為準直轄市 |trans-title=After 28 years, Taipei County today is promoted to quasi-municipality status |deadurl=yes|archivedate= 2008-01-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allowed the county to have the organizational and budgetary framework of a ''de jure'' municipality, but it was still formally styled as a county. Taichung County and Tainan City lobbied the central government for similar status. [[Taoyuan City|Taoyuan County]] was also upgraded to a quasi-municipality on 1 January 2011, as its population was above 2 million on the date of elevation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2010/new/dec/7/today-p3.htm|work=Liberty Times|date=2010-12-07|script-title=zh:升格為準直轄市 / 元旦改制日 桃園人口須維持200萬)}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Under President [[Ma Ying-jeou]]'s administration, the central government has reorganized more counties and cities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2008/new/dec/27/today-p3.htm |work=Liberty Times |date=2008-12-27 |script-title=zh:三都十五縣 馬指示漸進推動 |trans-title=Ma directs gradual progression towards 3 municipalities and 15 counties |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hjOy5NgD?url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2008/new/dec/27/today-p3.htm |archivedate=June 22, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Four mergers and promotions were approved in 2009 and became effective on 25 December 2010 and one more became effective in 25 December 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2009/new/jun/24/today-t1.htm |work=Liberty Times |date=2009-06-24 |script-title=zh:縣市升格 北中高過關 南縣市補考 |trans-title=Promotion of Cities and Counties: Taipei, Taichung, and Kaohsiung approved; Tainan awaits further examination |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5hmHkK2Ql?url=http://www.libertytimes.com.tw/2009/new/jun/24/today-t1.htm |archivedate=June 24, 2009 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://zh.wikinews.org/wiki/%E8%87%BA%E7%81%A3%E5%86%8D%E6%B7%BB%E7%9B%B4%E8%BD%84%E5%B8%82 | work=Wikinews | date=2009-06-29 | script-title=zh:臺灣再添直轄市}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The summary of changes on administrative divisions are shown below

|-
|[[Kaohsiung]] City||Formerly a provincial city, elevated as a special municipality in 1979. In 2010, a new Kaohsiung special municipality was established by merging former [[Kaohsiung County]] with the existing Kaohsiung City.

&lt;small&gt;Note:
# Since the provinces are streamlined, special municipalities are usually counted with cities and counties.
# In Chinese, all special municipalities, cities, and county-administered cities have the word "shì" (市, "city") in their full official names.
# Cities are sometimes called provincial cities (省轄市, shěngxiáshì) to distinguish them from the other two types of cities.
# Under the administrative scheme, some cities and counties may share the same name but are independent administrations; this occurs with Chiayi City and Chiayi County, and Hsinchu City and Hsinchu County.&lt;/small&gt;

===Special municipalities, cities and counties===
{{Taiwan Labelled Map}}
{{main|Special municipality (Taiwan)|Provincial city (Taiwan)|County (Taiwan)}}
{{see also|List of administrative divisions of Taiwan}}
Currently there are three types and in total 22 administrative divisions are directly governed by the central government ([[Executive Yuan]]). According to the ''Local Government Act'' of [[Taiwan]], a place with population more than 1.25 million may become a [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]], a place with population between 0.5 and 1.25 million may become a [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|city]]. Counties with population more than 2 million may grant some extra privileges in local autonomy that was designed for special municipalities.

These 22 divisions are also regulated by the ''Local Government Act'' as local self-governance bodies. Each division has its own executive called "city/county government" and own legislature called "city/county council". The city mayors, county magistrates and all legislators are elected by the people under its jurisdiction every four years. Geographically,

According to the ''Local Government Act'', a [[County (Taiwan)|county]] is divided into [[Township (Taiwan)|townships]] and [[County-administered city|county-administered cities]]. The county seat or place with population between 100,000 and 500,000 may become a [[county-administered city]]. A [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipality]] or a [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|city]] is divided into [[District (Taiwan)|districts]].

The [[Township (Taiwan)|townships]], [[County-administered city|county-administered cities]] in [[County (Taiwan)|counties]], and mountain indigenous [[District (Taiwan)|district]] in [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipalities]] are also local self-governance bodies. Each division has its own executive called "township/city/district office" and own legislature called "township/city/district council". The city mayors, township/district chiefs and all legislators are elected by the people under its jurisdiction every four years. The normal [[District (Taiwan)|districts]] in [[Special municipality (Taiwan)|special municipalities]] and [[Provincial city (Taiwan)|cities]] are governed as branches of the municipality/city government and do not hold any local self-governance power.

The mountain indigenous [[Township (Taiwan)|township]] and [[District (Taiwan)|districts]] are created for its significant population of [[Taiwanese aborigines]], in these divisions, only [[Taiwanese aborigines]] may be elected to be the township/district chiefs.

===Lower-level administrative divisions===

===Joint Service Centers of Executive Yuan===
{{see also|Regions of Taiwan}}
The central government operates five regional Joint Service Centers (JSC, {{lang|zh-tw|[[:zh:行政院聯合服務中心|區域聯合服務中心]]}}) outside [[Taipei]] as outposts of the government ministries in the [[Executive Yuan]], similar to the cross-departmental mode of working in the former [[Government Office]]s in England. These regions, laid out the Comprehensive National [[Spatial planning|Spatial Development]] Plan for Taiwan ({{lang|zh-tw|臺灣地區國土綜合開發計劃}}), can be considered a [[de facto]] level of government, perhaps equivalent to the [[English region]]s or the [[federal districts of Russia]].

The divisions of northern Taiwan are not covered by any JSC, including [[Hsinchu]] (city and [[Hsinchu County|county]]), [[Keelung]], [[New Taipei City|New Taipei]], [[Taipei]], [[Taoyuan, Taiwan|Taoyuan]] and [[Yilan County, Taiwan|Yilan]]. They are served directly by the headquarter of [[Executive Yuan]] in [[Taipei]].

=== Romanization ===
{{Main|Chinese language romanization in Taiwan}}

The [[romanization]] used for Taiwanese [[placename]]s above the county level is a modified form of [[Wade–Giles]], ignoring the apostrophes and hyphens of the original, thus yielding "Taipei" instead of "T'ai-pei" and "Yilan" instead of "I-lan", for example. Some [[postal romanization]]s also exist, like "Keelung" and "Kinmen".
In 2002, the ROC adopted [[Tongyong Pinyin]] as its national standard for romanization. Most [[Township (Taiwan)|townships]] and [[County-controlled city|county-controlled cities]] changed their romanization to Tongyong Pinyin at that time. However, some local administrations, like [[Taipei]] and [[Taichung]], decided to use [[Hanyu Pinyin]]. In 2009, Tongyong Pinyin was replaced by [[Hanyu Pinyin]] as the ROC government standard.&lt;ref name="taipei_times_2008-09-18"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=Taipei Times|date=2008-09-18|title=Hanyu Pinyin to be standard system in 2009|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/taiwan/archives/2008/09/18/2003423528}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="china_post_2008-09-18"&gt;{{cite news|publisher=The China Post|date=2008-09-18|title=Gov't to improve English-friendly environment|url=http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national%20news/2008/09/18/175155/Gov%27t-to.htm|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080919054355/http://www.chinapost.com.tw/taiwan/national/national%20news/2008/09/18/175155/Gov%27t%2Dto.htm|archivedate=2008-09-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Currently, most of the divisions are romanized by [[Hanyu Pinyin]] system, but some local governments still use [[Tongyong Pinyin]], like [[Kaohsiung]]. In 2011, the ROC Ministry of the Interior restored historical romanizations for two towns, [[Lukang, Changhua|Lukang]] and [[Tamsui District|Tamsui]].

The {{Nihongo|'''Akashi Strait'''|明石海峡|Akashi Kaikyō}} is a [[strait]] between the [[Japanese archipelago|Japanese islands]] of [[Honshu]] and [[Awaji Island|Awaji]]. The strait connects [[Seto Inland Sea]] and [[Osaka Bay]]. The width of the Akashi Strait is approximately 4 kilometers. Its maximum depth is about 110 meters.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.jb-honshi.co.jp/english/bridgeworld/bridge.html|title=Akashi-Kaikyo Bridge - Bridge World - Enjoy the top of the Bridge, the LONGEST BRIDGE in the world!|website=www.jb-honshi.co.jp|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The utmost tidal current is about {{convert|4.5|m/s|kn|abbr=off}}.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The 1.5 kilometer strait is one of the important points of the Seto Inland Sea and is at the mouth of the [[Pacific Ocean]]. The surrounding waters around Akashi Strait is a known fishery area. The Akashi Strait is designated as an international shipping channel by the Maritime Traffic Safety Act in [[Japan]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[Akashi Kaikyō Bridge]] crosses the strait. This 3.911 kilometer long [[suspension bridge]] links the city of [[Kobe]], the capital of the [[Hyōgo Prefecture]], on [[Honshu|Honshu Island]] to Iwaya on [[Awaji Island]], also within the Hyōgo Prefecture. Its longest span measures 1.991 kilometers.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; After 10 years of construction it was finally opened to traffic on 5 April 1998.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.roadtraffic-technology.com/projects/akashi-kaikyo-bridge-strait-japan/|title=Akashi Kaikyo Bridge, Akashi Strait|website=Road Traffic Technology|access-date=2016-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the time of its opening in 1998, it was the world's longest suspension bridge.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

The '''Azores hotspot''' is a [[volcano|volcanic]] [[hotspot (geology)|hotspot]] located at the [[Azores]] in the Northern [[Atlantic Ocean]]. A volcanic hotspot is defined as an area of high volcanic activity, a long term source of volcanism. The type of hotspot that characterises the [[Azores]] is a relatively young one associated with a bathymetric swell, a [[gravity anomaly]] and [[basalt]] [[geochemistry]] that differs from normal ocean ridge basalts.&lt;ref name="Gente et al"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.kharsag.net/images/download/GenteG3_03.pdf |title=Interaction between the Mid-Atlantic Ridge and the Azores hot spot during the last 85 Myr: Emplacement and rifting of the hot spot-derived plateaus |author1=Gente P. |author2=Dyment J. |author3=Maia M. |author4=Goslin J. |journal=Geochemistry Geophysics Geosystems |year=2003 |volume=4 |issue=10 |pages=1–23 |doi=10.1029/2003GC000527 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220044834/http://www.kharsag.net/images/download/GenteG3_03.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-20 |df= |bibcode=2003GGG.....4.8514G}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Azores hotspot also differs from usual hotspots like [[Hawaii]] due the fact that it has interactions with the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]], which lies just west of the hotspot. The centre of the hotspot plume has been suggested to be located 100 to 200&amp;nbsp;km east of the [[Mid-Atlantic Ridge]] near the island of [[Faial Island|Faial]].&lt;ref name="Cannat et al."&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.ipgp.fr/rech/lgm/je/PDF/1999CannatetalEPSL.pdf |title=Mid-Atlantic Ridge–Azores hotspot interactions: along-axis migration of a hotspot-derived event of enhanced magmatism 10 to 4 Ma ago |author=Cannat, M. |author2=Briais, A. |author3=Deplus, C. |author4=Escartin, J. |author5=Georgen, J. |author6=Lin, J. |author7=Mercouriev, S. |author8=Meyzen, C. |author9=Muller, M. |author10=Pouliquen, G. |author11=Rabain, A. |author12=da Silva, P. |last-author-amp=yes |journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters |year=1999 |volume=173 |issue=3 |pages=257–269 |doi=10.1016/S0012-821X(99)00234-4 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220044834/http://www.ipgp.fr/rech/lgm/je/PDF/1999CannatetalEPSL.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-20 |df= |bibcode=1999E&amp;PSL.173..257C}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geological area==
The Azores domain comprises the [[Azores Plateau]] and the Azores archipelago (formed of 9 islands extending a distance of 480&amp;nbsp;km) which has been volcanically active for around 7Myr. The archipelago lies on the lateral branch of the Mid-Atlantic Ridge near the junction of three major tectonic plates; the [[North American Plate]], the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[African Plate]].&lt;ref name="Silveira et al."&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222700910_Azores_hotspot_signature_in_the_upper_mantle/file/d912f509cbbf326f27.pdf | title=Azores hotspot signature in the upper mantle | author=Silveria, G. | author2=Stutzmann, E. | author3=Davaille, A. | author4=Montagner, J. | author5=Mendes-Victor, L. | author6=Sebai, A. | last-author-amp=yes | journal=Journal of Volcanology and Geothermal Research | year=2006 | volume=156 | issue=1–2 | pages=23–34 | doi=10.1016/j.jvolgeores.2006.03.022| bibcode=2006JVGR..156...23S }}&lt;/ref&gt; This unique location causes the area to have ridge-hotspot interaction with a variation of volcanic processes.

==The Azores Plateau==

The Azores archipelago rises from Azores Plateau, which is an area of thickened [[oceanic crust]] and is thought to be formed from the Azores hotspot 20 Mya. This has been shown through mapping negative velocity [[S-wave]] anomalies beneath the Azores. This has shown that beneath the Azores Plateau there is a negative anomaly limited in the upper 250–300&amp;nbsp;km which is suggestive to be a signature to a present-day dying plume which would have created the Azores Plateau.&lt;ref name="Silveira et al."/&gt;

==Hotspot–ridge interactions==

The Mid Atlantic Ridge offers a different perspective and insight into hotspots. The ridge acts as a cross section through the mantle plume. Anomalies on the Mid Atlantic Ridge have been shown to relate to interactions with the hotspot beneath the Azores. Gravity field modelling studies have shown that the crustal thickness in this area is 60% greater than normal, there is an elevated [[Mid-ocean ridge|spreading ridge]].&lt;ref name="Bourdon et al."&gt;{{cite journal | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/222493962_Ridge-hotspot_interaction_along_the_Mid-Atlantic_Ridge_between_3730_and_4030N_the_UTh_disequilibrium_evidence | title=Ridge-hotspot interaction along the Mid-Atlantic Ridge between 37°30′ and 40°30′N: the UTh disequilibrium evidence | author=Bourdon, B. | author2=Langmuir, C. H. | author3=Zinder, A. | last-author-amp=yes | journal=Earth and Planetary Science Letters | year=1996 | volume=142 | pages=175–189 | doi=10.1016/0012-821x(96)00092-1 | bibcode=1996E&amp;PSL.142..175B}}&lt;/ref&gt; The influence of the hotspot on the spreading ridge is mainly asymmetrical to the hotspot (north and south). It is thought that crust at ridges is formed by a combination of processes (magmatic and tectonic) with magma addition coming from short lived [[magma chamber]]s.&lt;ref name="Singh et al."&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://lib.gig.ac.cn/local/nature/442,1029-1032.pdf |title=Discovery of a magma chamber and faults beneath a Mid-Atlantic Ridge hydrothermal field |author=Singh, S. C. |author2=Crawford, W. C. |author3=Carton, H. |author4=Seher, T. |author5=Combier, V. |author6=Cannat, M. |author7=Canales, J. P. |author8=Dusunur, D. |author9=Escartin, J. |author10=Miranda, M. |last-author-amp=yes |journal=Nature |year=2006 |volume=442 |issue=7106 |pages=1029–1032 |doi=10.1038/nature05105 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220080930/http://lib.gig.ac.cn/local/nature/442%2C1029-1032.pdf |archivedate=2013-12-20 |df= |pmid=16943836 |bibcode=2006Natur.442.1029S }}&lt;/ref&gt; The hotspot is suggested to be responsible of increased melt production within the mantle supporting a longer lived magma chamber causing the crust to be thicker. However, the Mid Atlantic Ridge has also been shown to have effects on the Azores hotspot that effected the characteristics of the Azores Plateau. It has been suggested that the main volcanic ridges on the plateau were created at the Mid Atlantic Ridge spreading axis. The interactions between the Mid Atlantic Ridge and the Azores hotspot are responsible for the unique [[Geomorphology|geomorphological]] characteristics displayed in the Azores Plateau, archipelago and the area of ridge that passes through it.

'''Badgini''' (also spelled '''Bajini''') was a [[sultanate]] on the island of [[Grande Comore]]. It was independent until 1886, when [[Said Ali bin Said Omar of Grande Comore|Sultan Said Ali bin Said Omar]] of [[Sultanate of Bambao|Bambao]] made it a part of the unified [[Ngazidja]] Sultanate. It was ruled by the M'Dombozi clan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5331">The [[Hinduism|Hindu]] religious text ''[[Manusmriti]]'' describes '''Brahmavarta''' as the region between the rivers [[Saraswati River|Saraswati]] and [[Drishadwati]] in India. The text defines the area as the place where the "good" people are born, with "goodness" being dependent on location rather than behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Mlecchas, Yavanas and Heathens: Interacting Xenologies in Early Nineteenth-Century Calcutta |first=Dermot |last=Killingley |title=Beyond Orientalism: The Work of Wilhelm Halbfass and Its Impact on Indian and Cross-cultural Studies |editor1-first=Eli |editor1-last=Franco |editor2-first=Karin |editor2-last=Preisendanz |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |year=2007 |isbn=978-8-12083-110-0 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=tv-4tyO9u_QC&amp;pg=PA125 |page=125}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name has been translated in various ways, including "holy land", "sacred land",&lt;ref name="Olivelle" /&gt; "abode of gods" and "the scene of creation".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Early Aryans to Swaraj |volume=1 |editor1-first=S.

The precise location and size of the region has been the subject of academic uncertainty.&lt;ref name="Scharfe"&gt;{{cite book |title=The State in Indian Tradition |first=Hartmut |last=Scharfe |publisher=BRILL |year=1989 |isbn=900-4-09060-6 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=2AQ4AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA12 |page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some scholars, such as the archaeologists [[Bridget Allchin|Bridget]] and [[Raymond Allchin]], believe the term ''Brahmavarta'' to be synonymous with the [[Aryavarta]] region.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Rise of Civilization in India and Pakistan |first1=Bridget |last1=Allchin |first2=Raymond |last2=Allchin |authorlink1=Bridget Allchin |authorlink2=Raymond Allchin |publisher=Cambridge University Press |year=1982 |isbn=978-0-52128-550-6 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=r4s-YsP6vcIC&amp;pg=PA250 |page=250}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to ''Manusmriti'', the purity of a place and its inhabitants decreased the further it was from Brahmavarta. [[Aryan]] (noble) people were believed to inhabit the "good" area and the proportion of [[Mleccha]] (barbarian) people in the population rose as the distance from it increased. This implies a series of concentric circles of decreasing purity as one moved away from the Brahmavarta centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Sanskrit &amp; Prakrit, Sociolinguistic Issues |first=Madhav |last=Deshpande |publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |year=1993 |isbn=978-8-12081-136-2 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=NDrqaELkKTEC&amp;pg=PA85 |page=85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The translation of ''Manusmriti'' made by [[Patrick Olivelle]], a professor of [[Sanskrit]], says: {{quote|The land created by the gods and lying between the divine rivers Saraswati and Drishadwati is called 'Brahmavarta' - the region of Brahman. The conduct handed down from generation to generation among the social classes and the intermediate classes of that land is called the 'conduct of good people'.

Kuruksetra and the lands of the Matsyas, Pancalas, and Surasenakas constitute the 'land of Brahmin seers', which borders on the Brahmavarta. All the people on earth should learn their respective practices from a Brahmin born in that land.&lt;ref name="Olivelle"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Law Code of Manu |author=Manu |editor-first=Patrick |editor-last=Olivelle |editorlink=Patrick Olivelle |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2004 |isbn=978-0-19280-271-2 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=VmfXnfB-474C&amp;pg=PA24 |page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn|These are the ancient [[Kuru Kingdom|Kuru]], [[Matsya Kingdom|Matsya]], [[Panchala]] and [[Surasena]] kingdoms.}}}}

The French [[Indology|Indologist]] who later converted to Hindu, [[Alain Daniélou]], notes that the ''[[Rig Veda]]'', which is an earlier Hindu text, describes the region later known as Brahmavarta as the heartland of Aryan communities and the geography described in it suggests that those communities had not moved much beyond the area. He says that later texts, contained in the ''[[Brahmanas]]'', indicate that the centre of religious activity had moved from Brahmavarta to an adjacent area south-east of it known as Brahmarisihidesa.{{efn|Translated as "Land of Brahmin sages".&lt;ref name="Scharfe" /&gt;}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=A Brief History of India |first=Alain |last=Daniélou |authorlink=Alain Daniélou |others=Trans.

'''Clare Palmer''' (born 1967) is a British philosopher, theologian and scholar of [[environmental studies|environmental]] and [[religious studies]] who is currently a professor in the Department of Philosophy at [[Texas A&amp;M University]]. She has previously held academic appointments at the [[University of Greenwich]], the [[University of Stirling]], [[Lancaster University]] and [[Washington University in St. Louis]], among others. Palmer is known for her work in [[environmental ethics|environmental]] and [[animal ethics|animal]] ethics.

She has published three sole-authored books—''Environmental Ethics'' ([[ABC-CLIO]], 1997), ''Environmental Ethics and Process Thinking'' ([[Oxford University Press]], 1998) and ''Animal Ethics in Context'' ([[Columbia University Press]], 2010)—as well as the co-authored ''Companion Animal Ethics'' ([[Wiley-Blackwell]], 2015) and seven sole- or co-edited [[edited collection|collections]]. She is a former editor of the religious studies journal ''Worldviews: Environment, Culture, Religion'', and a former president of the [[International Society for Environmental Ethics]].

In ''Environmental Ethics and Process Thinking'', which was based on her doctoral research, Palmer explores the possibility of a [[process philosophy]]-inspired account of environmental ethics, focussing on the work of [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Charles Hartshorne]]. She ultimately concludes that a process ethic is not a desirable approach to environmental questions, despite the fact that process thought has been co-opted by some environmentalist thinkers. In ''Animal Ethics in Context'', Palmer asks about responsibilities to aid animals, in contrast to the typical focus in animal ethics on not harming animals. She defends a contextual, relational ethic according to which humans will typically have duties to assist only [[domestication|domestic]], and not [[wild animals|wild]], animals in need. However, humans will often be permitted to assist wild animals, and may be obligated to do so if there is a particular (causal) relationship between humans and the animals' plight.

[[File:The Queen's College, Oxford (pic 2).jpg|thumb|right|[[The Queen's College, Oxford]] ''(pictured 2012)'' where Palmer read for her doctorate.]]
Palmer read for a [[BA (Hons)]] in theology at [[Trinity College, Oxford]], graduating in 1988, before reading for a [[Doctor of Philosophy|doctorate]] in philosophy at the same university. From 1988 to 1991, she was based at [[Wolfson College, Oxford|Wolfson College]], before becoming a Holwell Senior Scholar at [[The Queen's College, Oxford|The Queen's College]].&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; In 1992, having previously published [[book reviews]], Palmer published her first research publication,&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; "Stewardship: A Case Study in Environmental Ethics", in the [[edited collection]] ''The Earth Beneath: A Critical Guide to Green Theology'', published by [[SPCK]]. She was also, along with Ian Ball, Margaret Goodall, and John Reader, a co-editor of the volume.&lt;ref&gt;Ball, Ian, Margaret Goodall, Clare Palmer and John Reader, eds. (1992).

''Environmental Ethics''. Santa Barbara and Denver: ABC-CLIO.&lt;/ref&gt; Additionally, the first issue of ''Worldviews: Environment, Culture, Religion'' (later renamed ''Worldviews: Global Religions, Culture, and Ecology''), a [[peer reviewed]] [[academic journal]] in [[religious studies]], was published. Palmer was the founding editor,&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Clare (1997). "Editorial". ''Worldviews: Environment, Culture, Religion'' '''1''' (1): 1–2. {{doi|10.1163/156853597X00173}}&lt;/ref&gt; and she remained editor until 2007.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt;

Palmer returned to working in the UK in 1998, becoming a lecturer in religious studies at the [[University of Stirling]].&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; That same year, she published ''Environmental Ethics and Process Thinking'' with the [[Clarendon Press]] imprint of [[Oxford University Press]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Clare (1998).

Palmer remained at Stirling for several years before taking up the post of [[senior lecturer]] in philosophy at [[Lancaster University]] in 2001. While at Lancaster, she became the vice-president of the [[International Society for Environmental Ethics]] (ISEE). In 2005, she moved to [[Washington University in St. Louis]], where she took up the role of [[associate professor]], jointly appointed in departments of philosophy and environmental studies.&lt;ref name="CV"/&gt; The same year, the five-volume encyclopaedia ''Environmental Ethics'', co-edited by Palmer and [[J.

London and New York: Routledge.&lt;/ref&gt; and, in the subsequent year, she was part of "The Animal Studies Group" which published the collection ''Killing Animals'' with the [[University of Illinois Press]].&lt;ref&gt;The Animal Studies Group, ed. (2006). ''Killing Animals''. Champaign-Urbana: Illinois University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; While at Washington, she was also the editor of both ''Teaching Environmental Ethics'' ([[Brill (publisher)|Brill]], 2007)&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Clare, ed.

==Thought==

===Environmental ethics===
[[File:John B. Cobb, Jr.jpg|thumb|right|The process philosopher [[John B. Cobb]] ''(pictured, 2013)'' challenges Palmer's interpretation of [[Alfred North Whitehead]]'s philosophy.]]
In ''Environmental Ethics and Process Thinking'', Palmer examines whether [[process philosophy]], in particular the philosophies of [[Alfred North Whitehead]] and [[Charles Hartshorne]], can provide an appropriate background for engaging in environmental ethics.&lt;ref name="Garland"/&gt; Process thought, Clark notes, has frequently appealed more to theologically-inclined environmental ethicists than [[classical theism]]; in particular, the views of Hartshorne and Cobb have been influential.&lt;ref name="Clark"/&gt;

Palmer first sets forth a process ethic. The ethic she presents is similar to [[John Stuart Mill]]'s [[utilitarianism]], but while Mill's approach locates value in [[pleasure]], Palmer's process ethic locates value in "richness" of experience. She then compares this ethic to several dominant schools in environmental ethics: "individualist consequentialism" (as championed by [[Peter Singer]], Donald VanDeVeer and [[Robin Attfield]]), "individualist deontological environmental ethics" (including the diverse positions presented by [[Albert Schweitzer]], Kenneth Goodpastor, [[Tom Regan]] and [[Paul Taylor (philosopher)|Paul Taylor]]), "collectivist environmental ethics" (including those thinkers who advocate doing what is best for nature as a whole, such as [[Aldo Leopold]] and Callicott in his earlier work) and [[deep ecology]].&lt;ref name="Garland"/&gt;

Process ethics, Palmer argues, is closer to individualist consequentialism than individualist deontological environmental ethics. In considering collectivist environmental ethics, Palmer asks how process thinkers could approach natural collectives, such as [[ecosystem]]s. She argues that Whitehead could view them as single entities with a good of their own, while Hartshorne could not. The primary difference between process ethics and collectivist environmental ethics, however, is that the former has a [[theological]] basis. The advocates of deep ecology have previously sought support from the views of Whitehead; two affinities are the shared [[holism]] and a shared concern with the extension of the [[self]], but Palmer finds that the views of Whitehead and the views of the deep ecology advocate [[Arne Næss]] differ in these areas.&lt;ref name="Garland"/&gt;

The book was not intended to either present or defend any particular position in environmental ethics, but rather to explore what process philosophers could say or have said about environmental issues.&lt;ref name="Response to Cobb and Menta"/&gt; There are, for Palmer, two key problems with a process approach to environmental ethics. The first concerns the value of human and nonhuman life; for process thinkers, the latter will always be trumped by the former in terms of value. The second concerns human perspectives; as process philosophy invariably models interpretation of all entities on human experience, it is not well-suited to characterising non-human nature. Palmer thus concludes that process philosophy does not provide a suitable basis for environmental ethics.&lt;ref name="Garland"/&gt;

The book was hailed as an important addition to the literature in both environmental ethics and process philosophy.&lt;ref name="Morris"/&gt; Garland offered two challenges to Palmer's claims. First, he challenged her linking of process ethics with individualist consequentialism, arguing that it is instead somewhere between individualist consequentialism and deep ecology. Second, he challenged Palmer's claim that process philosophers will always favour human ends over nonhuman ends.&lt;ref name="Garland"/&gt; Cobb and Menta, though both welcoming her consideration of process philosophy, challenged Palmer's interpretation of the philosophy of Whitehead and Hartshorne on a number of points.&lt;ref name="Cobb"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Menta"/&gt;

In addition to writing on process approaches to the environment, Palmer has contributed to [[Christian ethics|Christian]] environmental ethics more broadly,&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Claire (1994).

===Animal ethics===
[[File:Go on you can do it - Flickr - Lip Kee.jpg|thumb|right|Palmer opens her ''Animal Ethics in Context'' by comparing our intuitive response to the suffering in a case of [[wildebeest]] drowning during migration ''(example migration pictured)'' and a case of horses neglected by their human owners.&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Clare (2010). ''Animal Ethics in Context''. New York: Columbia University Press. pp. 1–2.&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Palmer does not explicitly connect ''Environmental Ethics and Process Thought'' to ''Animal Ethics in Context'', her second monograph; the latter does, however, address environmental ethics, insofar as it offers an attempt to bridge environmental ethics and animal ethics.&lt;ref name="Dombrowski"/&gt; In contrast to more typical approaches to animal ethics which focus on the ethics of harming animals, Palmer asks, in ''Animal Ethics in Context'', about the ethics of aiding animals,&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; with a focus on the distinction between [[wild animal|wild]] and [[domestication|domestic]] animals.&lt;ref name="Dombrowski"/&gt; She follows mainstream animal ethics approaches in arguing that humans have a ''prima facie'' duty not to harm any animal. However, when it comes to aiding animals, she argues that human obligations differ depending on the context.&lt;ref name="Dombrowski"/&gt;

Palmer begins by defending the claim that animals have moral standing, and then surveys three key approaches to animal ethics; utilitarian approaches, [[animal rights]] approaches, and [[capabilities approach]]es. All are lacking, she argues, as they are fundamentally capacity-oriented, and thus unable to properly take account of human relationships to animals. However, her approach leans more strongly towards a Regan-inspired rights view. She next identifies different kinds of relations humans may have with animals: [[affection|affective]], [[contractarianism|contractual]] and, most significantly, [[cause|causal]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;

Palmer identifies the ''[[laissez faire]]'' intuition (LFI), which is the intuition that humans do not have an obligation to aid wild animals in need. There are three forms of the LFI:
#The strong LFI, according to which humans may not harm or assist wild animals.
#The weak LFI, according to which humans may not harm wild animals, but may assist them, despite lacking an obligation to do so.
#No-contact LFI, according to which humans may not harm wild animals, but may assist them, and may gain obligations to assist them if humans are responsible for the animals' plight.&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;

Ultimately, Palmer endorses the no-contact version of the LFI. She defends the distinction between doing and allowing harm, and then defends the idea that humans have different positive obligations towards domestic animals and wild animals. At the centre of Palmer's approach is the fact that humans are causally responsible for the hardship faced by some animals, but not the hardship faced by others. She then deploys this philosophy in a number of imagined cases in which humans have varying relations to particular animals in need. She closes the book by considering possible objections, including the idea that her approach would not require someone [[Famine, Affluence, and Morality|to save a drowning child at little cost to themselves]].&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt;

Thus, Palmer argues that humans are not normally required to aid wild animals in need.&lt;ref name="Dorado"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Against the View"/&gt; The philosopher Joel MacClellan, a critic of intervention, challenges Palmer on three grounds: first, he says that the difference between our obligations to domestic and wild animals in Palmer's [[thought experiments]] could be justified on scientific, rather than moral, grounds; second, he challenges Palmer's characterisation of wildness as a relationship, rather than a capacity, arguing that a description of an animal as wild likely conveys that the animal has certain capacities lacked by domestic animals; and, third, he suggests that just as a utilitarian approach to wild animal suffering may ''demand'' too much, Palmer's contextual approach may ''permit'' too much, by allowing the policing of nature. The affinities between utilitarian and contextualist approaches, MacClellan argues, come from their shared idea of what is and is not valuable.&lt;ref name="MacClellan"/&gt; The pro-intervention philosopher Catia Faria criticises Palmer's argument from the other direction. Faria challenges Palmer's account by pointing to the counter-intuitive conclusions it would reach, Faria claims, in cases of assisting humans with whom an individual does not have significant relationships. Unless Palmer is willing to deny that humans have obligations to help suffering distant humans, Faria argues, the account cannot justify not aiding animals.&lt;ref name="Faria"/&gt;

In addition to contextual animal ethics and her exploration of animals in environmental ethics, Palmer has written on disenhanced animals (i.e., animals that have been engineered to lose certain capacities)&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Clare (2011). "Animal Disenhancement and the Non-Identity Problem: A Response to Thompson". ''Nanoethics'' '''5''' (1): 43–8. {{doi|10.1007/s11569-011-0115-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Sandøe, Peter, Paul M. Hocking, Sophie Collins, Björn Forkman, Kirsty Haldane, Helle H. Kristensen and Clare Palmer (2014). "The Blind Hens' Challenge: Does it undermine the view that only welfare matters in our dealings with animals?" ''Environmental Values'' '''23''' (6): 727–42.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[companion animals]].&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Clare (2013). "Companion Cats as Co-Citizens? Comments on Sue Donaldson and Will Kymlicka's ''Zoopolis''". ''Dialogue: Canadian Philosophical Review'' '''52''' (4): 759–67. {{Doi|10.1017/S0012217313000826}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Palmer, Clare (2012). "Does Breeding a Bulldog Harm It? Breeding, Ethics and Harm to Animals". ''Animal Welfare'' '''21''': 157–66. {{doi|10.7120/09627286.21.2.157}}&lt;/ref&gt; The latter topic was the focus of her co-authored text ''Companion Animal Ethics'',&lt;ref name="Companion Animal Ethics"/&gt; which explores ethical issues concerning companion animals, including feeding, medical care, euthanasia and others.&lt;ref&gt;Hiestand, Karen (2016). "''Companion Animal Ethics''". ''Veterinary Record'' '''178''' (11): 269. {{doi|10.1136/vr.i1425}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Its approximate surface area is {{convert|4,152|km2|0|abbr=on}}, of which {{convert|3,446|km2|0|abbr=on}} is in Romania. With the lagoons of [[Lake Razelm|Razim–Sinoe]] ({{convert|1,015|km2|0|abbr=on}} with {{convert|865|km2|0|abbr=on}} water surface), located south of the main delta, the total area of the Danube Delta is {{convert|5,165|km2|0|abbr=on}}. The Razim–Sinoe lagoon complex is geologically and ecologically related to the delta proper and the combined territory is listed as a [[List of World Heritage Sites in Romania|World Heritage Site]].

[[File:Danube Delta evolution.gif|500px|thumb|center|Historical evolution of the Danube Delta (AD 1 – 2015)]]
The modern Danube Delta began to form after 4000 BCE in a bay of the [[Black Sea]], when the sea rose to its present level. A sandy barrier blocked the Danube bay where the river initially built its delta. Upon filling the bay with [[sediment]], the delta advanced outside this barrier-blocked estuary after 3500 BCE, building several successive lobes:&lt;ref&gt;Giosan et al., 2006, Young Danube delta documents stable Black Sea level since the middle Holocene: Morphodynamic, paleogeographic, and archaeological implications, ''Geology'', 34, 757–760 (2006).

It consists of an intricate pattern of marshes, channels, streamlets and lakes. The average altitude is 0.52 m, with 20% of the territory below sea level, and more than half not exceeding one meter in altitude. Dunes on the most extensive [[strand plain]]s of the delta (Letea and Caraorman strand plains) stand higher (12.4 m and 7 m respectively). The largest lakes are lakes Dranov (21.7&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;), Roșu (14.5&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) and Gorgova (13.8&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;).

=== Distributaries of the Danube ===

The [[Danube]] branches into three main [[Distributary|distributaries]] into the [[river delta|delta]], '''[[Chilia branch|Chilia]]''', '''[[Sulina branch|Sulina]]''', and '''[[Sfântu Gheorghe branch|Sfântul Gheorghe]] (Saint George)'''. The last two branches form the '''Tulcea''' channel, which continues as a single body for several kilometers after the separation from the Chilia. At the mouths of each channel [[Alluvion|gradual formation of new land]] takes place, as the delta continues to expand.

'''[[Chilia branch|Chilia]]''', in the north, the longest, youngest, and most vigorous, with two secondary internal deltas and one microdelta in full process of formation at its mouth (to Ukraine).

'''[[Sulina branch|Sulina]]''', the central and thus the shortest arm, which consequently led to its extensive use for traffic and severe transformation. At its mouth is located the main port and a single settlement with urban characteristics of the Romanian part of the delta. Because of the [[alluvium]] deposited at its mouth, a channel gradually advancing into the sea (presently it has 10&amp;nbsp;km) was built in order to protect navigation.

[[Sfântu Gheorghe branch|Sfântul Gheorghe]] ('''Saint George''' in [[English language|English]]), in the south, is the oldest and most sparsely populated. Its [[alluvium]] has led to the creation, beginning in 1897, of the [[Sacalin Island]]s, which today measure 19&amp;nbsp;km in length.

=== Climate ===

The climate of the Danube Delta is continental, with strong influences from the vicinity of the [[Black Sea]] and its prevalent amphibian environment. It is the driest and sunniest region of Romania. The mean annual temperature is 11&amp;nbsp;°C (−1&amp;nbsp;°C in January and 22&amp;nbsp;°C in July), with mean precipitation between 400&amp;nbsp;mm/year and 300&amp;nbsp;mm/year, decreasing from west to east. Evaporation is around 1,000&amp;nbsp;mm/year, amplified by strong and frequent winds, resulting in long periods of drought in the summer. The northwest winds cause frequent storms in spring and autumn. In the interior of the delta, the continental character of the climate is very pronounced.

The Danube Delta falls within the [[Pannonian steppe]] [[ecosystem]] of eastern Europe, with Mediterranean influences. As a young region in full process of consolidation, the Danube Delta represents a very favourable place for the development of highly diverse [[flora]] and [[fauna]], unique{{clarify|date=January 2016}} in [[Europe]], with numerous rare species. It hosts 23 natural ecosystems, but due to the extent of [[wetlands]] an aquatic environment is prevalent; a terrestrial environment is also present on the higher grounds of the continental [[levees]], where [[xerophile]] ecosystems have developed. Between the aquatic and terrestrial environments is interposed a swampy, easily flooded strip of original flora and fauna, with means of adaptation to water or land, depending on the season or [[hydrological]] regime. At the contact between freshwater and sea water, some special physical, chemical and biological processes take place, which have led biologists to consider this area as a very different ecosystem called '''beforedelta'''. Musura Gulf, north of Sulina, and Saint George Gulf are considered the most representative of this type of ecosystem.

Situated on major migratory routes, and providing adequate conditions for nesting and hatching, the Danube Delta is a magnet for birds from six major [[ecoregions]] of the world, including the Mongolian, Arctic and Siberian. There are over 320 species of birds found in the delta during summer,&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/list/588/video Danube Delta - UNESCO World Heritage Centre&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; of which 166 are hatching species and 159 are migratory. Over one million individual birds (swans, wild ducks, [[coots]], etc.) winter here.

==== Ecosystem of running water ====

This comprises the arms of the Danube, and a series of its more important streamlets and channels. It is an environment rich in [[plankton]], [[worm]]s, [[mollusc]]s, [[Larva|grub]]s, and [[sponge]]s, with numerous species of fish, such as the [[carp]], [[pike (disambiguation)#Fishes|pike]], [[pike perch]], [[sheat-fish]], and freshwater [[sturgeons]] ([[sterlet]], [[Vyza]] and [[Danube mackerel]]).

==== Ecosystem of stagnant water ====

This environment includes the lakes, and various ponds, streamlets and channels. It is characterized by a rich floating and submerse flora (''[[Myriophyllum]]'', ''[[Ceratophyllum]]'', ''[[Vallisneria]]'' etc., under the water; ''[[Nymphaea alba]]'', ''[[Nuphar lutea]]'', ''[[Trapa natans]]'', ''[[Alisma plantago]]'' etc., floating plants with roots near the lakes' borders; and ''[[Salvinia natans]]'', ''[[Stratiotes aloides]]'', ''[[Spirogyra]]'' etc., floating plants without roots, having negative effect for aquatic [[bioproductivity]]). Of the fish, the most important are [[Tench]] (''Tinca tinca''), [[common bream]] (''Abramis brama''), [[common rudd]] (''Scardinius erythropthalmus''), [[Prussian carp]] (''Carassius auratus gibelio''), [[wels catfish]] (''Silurus glanis''), [[European perch]] (''Perca fluviatilis''), and [[northern pike]] (''Esox lucius'').

==== Ecosystem of marshy and flooding areas ====

[[File:RO004MS-04.jpg|thumb|200px|The Danube Delta birds: [[grey heron]] (''Ardea cinerea''), [[mallard]] or wild duck (''Anas platyrhynchos''), [[great white pelican]] (''Ardea cinerea''), [[great crested grebe]] (''Podiceps cristatus''). Stamp of Romania, 2004]]

Reed plants and floating reed islands (called '''plaur''' in [[Romania]]) are the most common and well known components of the Danube Delta. Vegetation of this ecosystem consists of the common reed (''[[Phragmites communis]]'') and, on near river banks, mace reed/cattail (''[[Typha latifolia]]'', ''[[Typha angustifolia]]''), sedge (''[[Carex dioica]]'', ''[[Carex stricta]]''), Dutch rush (''[[Scirpus radicans]]'', ''[[Schoenoplectus lacustris]]''), and brook mint (''[[Mentha aquatica]]''), etc. They provide ideal spawning and nesting grounds. The '''plaur''' are a mixture of reed roots, grass and soil, usually floating or anchored to the riverbed. As a rule, the reed surrounds the lakes and ponds, and slowly invades the water surface.

This type of ecosystem is noted for its variety and large population of birds, some of them very rare. The most important are the [[tufted duck]] (''Aythya fuligula'', [[red-crested pochard]] (''Netta rufina''), [[mallard]] (''Anas platyrhynchos''), [[greylag goose]] (''Anser anser''), [[pygmy cormorant]] (''Microcarbo pygmeus''), [[purple heron]] (''Ardea purpurea''), [[great egret|great white egret]] (''Egretta alba''), [[little egret]] (''Egretta garzetta''), [[eurasian spoonbill]](''Platalea leucorodia''), [[great white pelican]] (''Pelecanus onocrotalus''), [[Dalmatian pelican]] (''Pelecanus crispus''), [[mute swan]] (''Cygnus olor''), and [[glossy ibis]] (''Plegadis falcinellus''). A recent and welcomed newcomer is the [[common pheasant|pheasant]] (''Phasianus colchicus'').

Among the mammals, there is the [[Eurasian  otter]] (''Lutra lutra''), [[European mink]] (''Mustela lutreola''), [[stoat|little ermine]] (''Mustela erminea aestiva''), [[wild boar]] (''Sus scrofa''), and [[wildcat|wild cat]] (''Felis silvestris''), in winter the [[European hare|hare]] (''Lepus europaeus'') and, on the brink of disappearing from the delta, the wolf and the fox. The [[raccoon dog|East Asian raccoon dog]] (''Nyctereutes procyonoides''), bizam/introduced [[muskrat]] (''Ondatra zibethica''), and to some extent South American [[coypu|nutria]] (''Myocastor coypus''), are recent species that have successfully adapted.

==== River bank and levee ecosystems ====

[[File:Nycticorax nycticorax' AM1 slepowron.jpg|thumb|230px|Black-crowned night heron]]
The firm land of the delta used to be covered with large groves of willow trees, which have been cut down almost entirely and replaced with Canadian poplars. On the river banks kept in their natural state, small groves of willow trees (''[[Salix alba]]'', ''[[Salix fragilis]]'', ''[[Salix purpurea]]'', ''[[Salix petandra]]'', ''[[Salix triandra]]'' etc.) can still be found, mixed with white poplar (''[[Populus alba]]''). Occasionally, the willow trees form corridors along the arms and bigger channels of the Danube. On the [[levees]] of [[Letea]] and [[Caraorman]], mixed forests of oak (''[[Quercus robur]]'', ''[[Quercus pedunculiflora]]'') with various trees (''[[Fraxinus pallisae]]'', ''[[Ulmus foliacea]]'', ''[[Populus tremula]]''), shrubs (''[[Prunus spinosa]]'', ''[[Crataegus monogyna]]'', ''[[Rosa canina]]'', ''[[Berberis vulgaris]]'' etc.), and vines (''[[Vitis sylvestris]]'', ''[[Hedera helix]]'', ''[[Humulus lupulus]]'', ''[[Periploca graeca]]'', which reaches up to 25m) grow on [[sand dune]] areas. On the Letea levee, these exotic-looking forests grow especially in the depressions between the sand dunes, in small groves called '''hasmace'''. Fauna of this region include the [[meadow viper]] (''Vipera ursinii''), [[osprey]] (''Pandion haliaetus''), and [[Eurasian eagle owl]] (''Bubo bubo''), etc.

The Danube Delta is perhaps the least inhabited region of temperate [[Europe]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.halmyris.org/history/danube-delta|title=The Danube Delta – Halmyris|website=www.halmyris.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-12-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=December 2015}} On the Romanian side live about 20,000 people, of whom 4,600 live in the port of [[Sulina]], which gives an average density of approx. two inhabitants per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. The rest of the population is scattered among 27 villages, of which only three, all situated marginally, had  more than 500 people in 2002. The city of [[Tulcea]], at the western edge of the delta, has a population of 92,000 (in 2002); it represents the node of the region and the gate to the delta.

[[File:Sulina 4.jpg|right|thumb|250px|Sulina City – 1870 lighthouse]]

Its acute isolation and harsh conditions of living, based mainly on subsistence, made the Danube Delta a place of emigration, or transit at least. Very few of those born in the region stay there through adulthood; at the same time, the origins of its inhabitants vary widely, as people from many parts of [[Romania]] can be found in the delta. The total population has remained more or less constant throughout the 20th century; there were 12,000 inhabitants in the 1890s, and 14,000 before the Second World War. [[Romanians]] account for approximately 80% of the population, and [[Ukrainians]] for 10%. Other people living in the delta include ethnic minorities such as Greeks, Turks and Bulgarians (in 1992). Distinctive to the region, but very rare as an ethnic entity, are the [[Lipovans]], descendants of the Orthodox Old Rite followers who fled from religious persecution in [[Russia]] during the 18th century.

On the Ukrainian side, located at the northern edge of the delta, the town of [[Izmail]] has a population of 85,000, [[Kiliya, Ukraine|Kiliya]] a population of 21,800, and [[Vilkovo]], the main center of the [[Lipovan]] community, a population of 9,300.

==History==

[[File:Danube mouths 1867.JPG|thumb|The Danube Delta in 1867, as a part of the Ottoman Empire]]

Recorded history notes that the [[Dacians]] lived in the Danube Delta before it was conquered by the [[Romans]].  After later invasion by the [[Goths]], the region changed hands many times.  During the 15th century, the Danube Delta became part of the [[Ottoman Empire]]. In 1812, following the [[Russo-Turkish War (1806–1812)|Russo-Turkish War]], the borders of the Ottoman and [[Russian Empire]]s were set by the Kilia and Old Stambul Channels of the Danube, and in 1829 by the St George Channel. The [[Treaty of Paris (1856)|Treaty of Paris]] of 1856, which ended the [[Crimean War]], assigned the Danube Delta to the [[Ottoman Empire]] and [[Commissions of the Danube River|established an international commission]] which undertook a series of works to help navigation. In 1878, following the [[Russo-Turkish War (1877–1878)|defeat of Ottoman Empire]] by Russia and Romania, the border between the two countries was set by the Kilia and Old Stambul Channels.
[[File:DeltaPierderi.jpg|220px|left|thumb|Territorial losses of Romania in the Danube delta since 1948]]
In 1991, the Romanian part of the Danube Delta became part of [[UNESCO]]'s list of [[World Heritage Site]]s. Around 2,733&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the delta are strictly protected areas.

In 1998, under UNESCO's [[Programme on Man and the Biosphere]], the 6,264.03&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of the Danube Delta were established as a [[biosphere reserve]], shared by Romania and Ukraine.

Historically, in Romania, part of the Danube Delta was marked as a reserve in 1938.

In Ukraine, the Danube branch of the Black Sea State Reserve was established in 1973. In 1981, it was reorganized into the Natural Reserve "Danube Fluxes", and in 1998, it was extended into the Danube biosphere reserve.

Large-scale works began in the Danube Delta as early as the second half of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Iordachi, Constantin, Van Assche, Kristof (2014) The Bio-Politics of the Danube Delta. [https://rowman.com/ISBN/9780739195154 Lexington Books]. {{ISBN|978-0-7391-9514-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; First corrections of the Sulina arm began in 1862, and they continued throughout the 20th century. As a result, the length of the Sulina arm was reduced from 92 to 64&amp;nbsp;km, and its flow more than doubled, thus making it suitable for large-vessel navigation. Correcting the six large [[meanders]] on its course thereby reduced the length of the Sfântu Gheorghe from 108&amp;nbsp; to 108&amp;nbsp;km, and its flow also increased somewhat. Both these increases were made to the detriment of the Chilia arm, which at present remains the most unspoiled arm of the main three. These corrections, as well as the digging of various secondary channels throughout the body of the delta, have had a serious impact on the ecosystem. Natural environments have been altered, the breeding pattern of fish has been disrupted, and the flows in the main arms have increased, with serious consequences regarding the discharge of [[alluvia]] and the erosion of banks.

[[File:Danube Delta, fisherman.jpg|thumb|left|230px]]
Reed was intensively harvested during the [[Communist]] era. The regime had plans to transform the delta into a large agro-industrial zone. Although the first modern agricultural exploitation dates from 1939 (Ostrovul Tãtaru), only after 1960 were large areas drained and converted, to the detriment of the wetlands. In 1991 agricultural land in the delta surpassed 100,000 hectares, and more than a third of its surface has been affected by crop cultivation, forest plantation, or [[pisciculture]]. As a result of these changes, along with the increasing pollution and [[eutrophication]] of the waters of the Danube, and decades of exploitation and poor fishing regulations, the fish population has been visibly reduced.

In 2004, Ukraine inaugurated work on the [[Bistroe Channel]] that would provide an additional navigable link from the Black Sea to the populous Ukrainian section of the Danube Delta. However, because of the negative impact which this new channel might have on the fragile ecosystem of the delta, the [[European Union]] advised Ukraine to shut down the works. Romanian officials threatened to sue Ukraine at the [[International Court of Justice]]. Under the presidency of [[Kuchma]], Ukraine had responded that Romania was only afraid of the competition that the new channel would bring, and continued working on the channel. Under the presidency of [[Yuschenko]], who visited Romania in 2005, both sides agree that professionals should decide the fate of the channel. In the long run, Ukraine plans to build a navigation channel, if not through Bistroe Channel, then through another channel.

'''''Empires of the Indus: The Story of a River''''' is a [[non-fiction]] book by [[Alice Albinia]] that covers the writer's journey from [[Karachi]] to [[Tibet]], which is the natural course of the [[Indus River]]. The book gives an insight into the communities as well as the history and political framework of the countries through which the Indus flows.  ''Empires of the Indus'' was awarded the [[Jerwood Award]] by the [[Royal Society of Literature]] in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;

The content of the book is divided in 12 distinct sections, preceded by a preface. A map of the Indus river is given and several colour photographs. The book also has special sections named glossary, notes, select bibliography and an index. The glossary makes the book more understandable and comprehensible for readers not familiar with certain words and terms used in Pakistan, India and Tibet.

The '''geographical centre of Earth''' is the [[centroid|geometric centre]] of all land surfaces on [[Earth]]. In a more strict definition, it is the superficial [[barycenter]] of the mass distribution produced by treating each continent or island as a region of a thin shell of uniform density and approximating the [[geoid]] with a sphere. The centre is inside Earth but can be projected to the closest point on the surface.

In 1864, [[Charles Piazzi Smyth]], Astronomer Royal for Scotland, gave in his book ''Our Inheritance in the Great Pyramid'' the coordinates with {{coord|30|00|N|31|00|E|type:landmark_region:EG_scale:1000000|name=Geographical centre of all land surfaces on Earth (Smyth 1864)|display=inline}}, the location of the [[Great Pyramid of Giza]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Our inheritance in the Great Pyramid|last=Smyth|first=Charles Piazzi|authorlink=Charles Piazzi Smyth|year=1864|publisher=W.

He also argued the cultural significance of the location and its vicinity to Jerusalem. The expert committee deciding the issue, however, voted for Greenwich because "so many ships used the port of London".&lt;ref name="Wilson"/&gt; Referring to Smyth's book, [[Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard]] wrote in his 1884 book, ''The imaginary metrological system of the Great pyramid of Gizeh'', that the perfect location of the Great Pyramid along the longitudinal line could only have been purposefully done by its builders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The imaginary metrological system of the Great pyramid of Gizeh |last=Barnard |first=Frederick Augustus Porter |authorlink=Frederick Augustus Porter Barnard |year=1884 |publisher=[[John Wiley &amp; Sons]] |location= |isbn= |page= |pages=12–13 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ww7gAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA13&amp;dq=%22geographical+center%22+earth+pyramid&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=HZakT4eTFYeO8wTf4-y8Aw&amp;ved=0CEsQ6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=geographical%20center%20earth%20pyramid&amp;f=false |accessdate=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the September 1919 issue of ''Trestle Board Magazine'', [[Freemasonry|Mason]] William Galliher stated that knowledge of the Great Pyramid being the geographical centre was "determined by many years of scientific investigation" and that the Great Pyramid was likely to be the "last of the present land surface of the earth" to survive a cataclysmic event, due to its positioning.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=William Galliher |date=September 1919 |title=The Riddle of Cheops Pyramid |journal=Trestle Board Magazine |volume=33 |issue=3 |pages=9 |publisher=[[Kessinger Publishing]] |doi= |pmid= |pmc= |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e4bGA0Ss5VwC&amp;pg=PT18&amp;dq=%22geographical+center%22+earth&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=LZCkT53OGZSi8QTik5HXAw&amp;ved=0CFgQ6AEwBTgK#v=onepage&amp;q=geographical%20center%20earth&amp;f=false |accessdate=May 4, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1973, Andrew J. Woods, a physicist with [[General Atomics|Gulf Energy &amp; Environmental Systems]] in San Diego, used a digital global map and calculated the coordinates on a mainframe system as {{coord|39|00|N|34|00|E|type:landmark_scale:1000000|name=Geographical centre of all land surfaces on Earth (Woods 1973)|display=inline}}, in modern Turkey, 1,000&amp;nbsp;km north of Giza.&lt;ref name="Woods"&gt;{{cite book|series=I.C.R.

In 2003, a similar result was yielded by Holger Isenberg: 40°52'0"N, 34°34'0"E.&lt;ref&gt;Isenberg, Holger. ''Giza: Centre of Earth'', page 5, 2003. http://mars-news.de/pyramids/gizacenter5.html&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, [[Google Maps]] marked 40°52′N 34°34′E as the geographic centre of the world. &lt;ref&gt;http://www.hurriyetdailynews.com/google-marks-turkeys-corum-as-center-of-the-earth-100514&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, [[Susan Wise Bauer]] claimed in her book '' Earliest Accounts to the Fall of Rome'', that the theory that the Great Pyramid was the geographical centre of Earth would only hold true if a [[Mercator projection]] is used as the map for Earth, which was "unlikely to have been a common practice of the ancient Egyptians".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The History of the Ancient World: From the Earliest Accounts to the Fall of Rome |last=Bauer |first=Susan Wise |authorlink=Susan Wise Bauer |year=2007 |publisher=[[W.

The [[Republic of Macedonia]] is a country situated in [[Balkans|southeastern]] Europe with [[Geographic coordinate system|geographic coordinates]] {{Coord|41|50|N|22|00|E|type:country}}, bordering [[Kosovo]] and [[Serbia]] to the north, [[Bulgaria]] to the east, [[Greece]] to the south and [[Albania]] to the west. The country is part of the wider [[Macedonia (region)|region of Macedonia]] and makes up most of [[Vardar Macedonia]]. The country is a major transportation corridor from [[Western Europe|Western]] and [[Central Europe]] to [[Southern Europe]] and the [[Aegean Sea]]. Macedonia is a landlocked country but has three major natural lakes: [[Lake Ohrid]], [[Lake Prespa]] and [[Lake Dojran]]. It has a water area of 857&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, while its land area is 24,856&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;.

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Macedonia belongs to the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and Digital Map of European Ecological Regions by the [[European Environment Agency]], Macedonia's territory can be subdivided into four [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Pindus|Pindus Mountains]] [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]], [[Balkans|Balkan]] [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]], [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodopes]] [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]] and [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] [[sclerophyll]]ous and [[Temperate broadleaf and mixed forests|mixed forests]].

== Climate ==
{{Main|Republic of Macedonia#Climate}}
[[File:Macedonia map of Köppen climate classification.svg|thumb|300px|Macedonia map of Köppen climate classification.]]
Macedonia has a unique climate explained by its location and topography. The climate of the plains is a [[Mediterranean climate]] combined with the influence of the [[Black Sea]].&lt;ref name="castellan p.13"&gt;Georges Castellan, ''op. cit.'', p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; The country also holds continental characteristics, which are accentuated by the mountains in the south which prevent hot air from the south from moving to the north. Conversely, the [[Šar Mountains]], which are located in the northwestern part, block cold northern winds. In whole, the northern and western parts of the country are relatively close to a [[Continental climate]] and the southern and eastern to a Mediterranean climate.&lt;ref name="petit futé P.25"&gt;Dominique Auzias et Jean-Paul Labourdette, ''op. cit.'', p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;

Macedonia has four seasons, but the lengths of the seasons varies based on geography. The spring is often very short.&lt;ref name="petit futé P.25"/&gt; Summers are subtropical and it is not uncommon to see temperatures of above {{convert|40|°C|0|abbr=on}} during this season, especially in the plains along the valley of the [[Vardar]] river.&lt;ref name="castellan p.13"/&gt; Winters, although moderate, can be quite cold. Snowfalls during winter are common and occasionally heavy. The average annual temperature of the air is {{convert|11.5|°C|0|abbr=on}}, but the plains experience higher temperatures, {{convert|15|°C|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="petit futé P.25"/&gt; The warmest month is July, which has an average temperature of {{convert|22.2|°C|0|abbr=on}} and the coldest is January, with a temperature of {{convert|0.3|°C|0|abbr=on}}. The maximum and minimum temperatures recorded in Macedonia to date are {{convert|45.7|°C|0|abbr=on}} and {{convert|-31.5|°C|0|abbr=on}}, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.macedonianembassy.org.uk/country_profile.html |title=Macedonian ambassy in the United-Kingdom – Country and people |publisher=Macedonianembassy.org.uk |date= |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101013050120/http://www.macedonianembassy.org.uk/country_profile.html |archivedate=13 October 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rainfall is abundant in the western and eastern parts of the country, but the temperature decreases significantly in the Vardar region.&lt;ref name="petit futé P.25"/&gt; This region sees warmer winters through the ''Vardarec'' wind. This wind comes up from the mouth of the Vardar river and brings warm air.&lt;ref name="castellan p.13"/&gt; Skopje, considered a low-lying city, has an average of 64 rainy days per year. The month of October is the wettest with 61&amp;nbsp;mm; the driest is August with 28&amp;nbsp;mm. Rains are most common in the spring and fall.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/weather/world/city_guides/results.shtml?tt=TT004680 |title=Weather Centre – Skopje |publisher=BBC |date= |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Physical Geography ==

=== Boundaries ===
The country has some 766&amp;nbsp;km of boundaries, shared with Kosovo (159&amp;nbsp;km or 99&amp;nbsp;mi) to the northwest, Serbia (62&amp;nbsp;km or 39&amp;nbsp;mi) to the North, Bulgaria (148&amp;nbsp;km) to the east, Greece (246&amp;nbsp;km) to the south, and Albania (151&amp;nbsp;km) to the west.

The north border with Serbia and Kosovo is 221 kilometers in length. The border was made after World War II, between [[SR Macedonia]] and [[SR Serbia]].&lt;ref name="Boundaries of ROM"/&gt; But in 2008 when Kosovo [[2008 Kosovo declaration of independence|declared independence]] the border with it was remarked again. Rather more than half of the boundary separates Macedonia from Kosovo. From the tripoint with Albania, the boundary trends north-eastwards along the watershed of [[Šar Mountain]]. It describes a curve to the south across the River [[Lepenec]] and then turns to north-east to traverse Mount Crna before taking a course slightly to the north of east across the landscape features to the tripoint with Bulgaria.
[[File:Satellite image of Macedonia in December 2002.jpg|thumb|right|350px|Satellite image of Macedonia in December|alt=Photo of a cloud-covered Macedonia taken from space]]
The east border with Bulgaria has length of approximately 148&amp;nbsp;km. The settled boundary from Yugoslavia and the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]] was accepted after the independence in 1992.&lt;ref name="Boundaries of ROM"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ewan W. Anderson|title=International Boundaries: A Geopolitical Atlas|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=E7-menNPxREC&amp;pg=RA1-PA510|year=2003|publisher=Psychology Press|isbn=978-1-57958-375-0|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; The boundary starts from the tripoint with Greece, the boundary runs north, crossing the [[Strumica River|River of Strumica]] and then rising to the watershed which it follows northwards and then north-westwards to the tripoint with Serbia.

The south border that splits Macedonia from Greece is 228&amp;nbsp;km long and it is the longest Macedonian border. The border was marked with the [[Treaty of Bucharest (1913)|Treaty of Bucharest]] on 10 August 1913.&lt;ref name="Boundaries of ROM"/&gt; The border starts from the tripoint with Albania, in [[Lake Prespa]], the boundary runs in a straight line eastwards across the lake and then continues in the north of east trend across the relief to the Voras Oros, where it turns north-eastwards. It traverses the watershed of the Voras Oros and then continues eastwards along the watershed before dropping to the valley of Vardar river. The boundary continues eastwards and then turns north across the [[Dojran lake]], before, on the latitude of [[Valandovo]], turning east to the tripoint with Bulgaria on Mount Tumba.

The boundary with Albania was marked first in 1926 and then remarked with the [[Paris Peace Treaties, 1947|Treaty of Paris]] in 1947.&lt;ref name="Boundaries of ROM"/&gt; The boundary starts from the tripoint with Kosovo and follows a watershed before crossing, and for a short distance, following the [[Black Drin]] river and continuing along a crest line to [[Ohrid Lake]]. It crosses the lake, leaving approximately one-third in Albania, traverses a high ridge and meets the tripoint with Greece in Lake Prespa.

=== Topography ===
{{Main|Mountains of the Republic of Macedonia}}
[[File:Mount Korab, Republic of Macedonia.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Landscape of Mount Korab – the highest mountain in the country|alt=Mount Korab rising above clouds]]

Macedonia is a [[landlocked country]] that is geographically clearly defined by a central valley formed by the Vardar river and framed along its borders by mountain ranges. The terrain is mostly rugged, located between the [[Šar Mountains]] and [[Osogovo]], which frame the valley of the [[Vardar]] river. Three large lakes&amp;nbsp;— Lake Ohrid, Lake Prespa and Dojran Lake&amp;nbsp;— lie on the southern borders, bisected by the frontiers with Albania and Greece. Ohrid is considered to be one of the oldest lakes and biotopes in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.moe.gov.mk/soer2/ohrid_a.htm  |title=Macedonian Ministry of Environment |publisher=Web.archive.org |date= |accessdate=23 August 2010 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080119010740/http://www.moe.gov.mk/soer2/ohrid_a.htm |archivedate = 19 January 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; The region is seismically active and has been the site of destructive earthquakes in the past, most recently in 1963 when Skopje was heavily damaged by a major earthquake, killing over 1,000.

Macedonia also has scenic mountains. They belong to two different [[mountain range]]s: the first is the [[Šar Mountains]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Encyclopædia Britannica |url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/523838/Sar-Mountains |title=Britannica's article about Sar Mountains |publisher=Britannica.com |date= |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.euratlas.com/Atlasphys/Sarplanina2.htm |title=Sar Mountains on the Euratlas map of the Europe's most significant mountain ranges |publisher=Euratlas.com |date= |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; that continues to the West Vardar/Pelagonia group of mountains ([[Baba Mountain, Macedonia|Baba Mountain]], [[Nidže]], [[Kožuf|Kozuf]] and [[Jakupica]]), also known as the [[Dinaric Alps|Dinaric range]]. The second range is the [[Osogovo]]–[[Belasica]] mountain chain, also known as the [[Rhodope Mountains|Rhodope range]]. The mountains belonging to the Šar Mountains and the West Vardar/Pelagonia range are younger and higher than the older mountains that are part of the Osogovo-Belasica mountain group. The ten highest mountains in Macedonia are:

=== Hydrography ===
[[File:Golemo Ezero.jpg|thumb|left|Golemo Ezero, glacial lake located at 2218 m altitude in the [[Pelister]] mountains|alt=Golemo Ezero surrounded by land scattered with snow]]
In the Republic of Macedonia there are 1,100 large sources of water. The rivers flow into three different basins: the Aegean, the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] and that Black Sea basin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mymacedonia.net/links/geography.htm |title=Macedonia |publisher=Mymacedonia.net |date= |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Aegean basin is the largest. It covers 87% of the territory of the Republic, which is 22,075&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; . [[Vardar]], the largest river in this basin, drains 80% of the territory or 20,459&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;. Its valley plays an important part in the economy and the communication system of the country. The project named The Vardar Valley is considered to be crucial for the strategic development of the country.

The river [[Black Drim]]) forms the Adriatic basin, which covers an area of about 3,320&amp;nbsp;km², i. e. 13% of the territory. It issues from Lakes Prespa and Ohrid.

The Black Sea basin is the smallest with only 37&amp;nbsp;km² It covers the northern side of Mount [[Skopska Crna Gora]]. Here is the source of the river [[Binačka Morava]] which joins the [[South Morava]] and later the [[Danube]], which eventually flows into the Black Sea.

Despite being a landlocked country, Macedonia has three large lakes (Ohrid, [[Lake Prespa|Prespa]], and [[Lake Dojran|Dojran]]), three artificial lakes and roughly 50 ponds.

There are nine spa resorts in Macedonia: Banište, Banja Bansko, Istibanja, Katlanovo, [[Kežovica]], Kosovrasti, Banja Kočani, Kumanovski Banji and Negorci.

[[File:Vardar Veles Macedonia.jpg|thumb|right|250px|Vardar in [[Veles (city)|Veles]]|alt=The brown-coloured Vardar flowing through Veles]]

The Vardar is the longest and most important river in the Republic of Macedonia. It is {{convert|388|km|mi|abbr=on}} long, and drains an area of around {{convert|25,000|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}.

The river rises at Vrutok, a few kilometers north of [[Gostivar]] in the Republic of Macedonia. It passes through Gostivar, Skopje and into Veles, crosses the Greek border near [[Gevgelija]], [[Polykastro]] and [[Axioupoli]], before emptying into the Aegean Sea in [[Central Macedonia]] west of [[Thessaloniki]] in northern Greece.

The Vardar basin includes two-thirds of the territory of the Republic of Macedonia. For that the area is called "Vardar Macedonia" after the river, to distinguish it from "Aegean Macedonia" (in Greece) and "[[Pirin Macedonia]]" (in Bulgaria).

The valley comprises fertile lands in [[Polog]], Gevgelija and other parts. The river is surrounded by mountains elsewhere. The M1 / E75, connecting with [[Greek National Road 1]], runs through the valley along the river's entire length to near Skopje.

The river is depicted on the coat of arms of Skopje, which in turn is incorporated in the city's flag.&lt;ref&gt;Official portal of the city of Skopje: [http://www.skopje.gov.mk/EN/DesktopDefault.aspx?tabindex=0&amp;tabid=34 City symbols]. – Retrieved on 13 May 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Lake Ohrid ====
{{Main|Lake Ohrid}}
[[File:Ohridsoeen.jpg|thumb|250px|left|View of Ohrid Lake|alt=clouds above Lake Ohrid]]

Lake Ohrid (Macedonian: Охридско Езеро, Ohridsko Ezero) straddles the mountainous border between the southwestern Republic of Macedonia and eastern Albania. Lake Ohrid is the deepest lake of the [[Balkans]], with a maximum depth of 288&amp;nbsp;m (940&amp;nbsp;ft) and a mean depth of 155&amp;nbsp;m (508&amp;nbsp;ft). It covers an area of {{convert|358|km2|sqmi|abbr=on}}, containing an estimated 55.4&amp;nbsp;km³ of water. It is 30.4&amp;nbsp;km long by 14.8&amp;nbsp;km wide at its maximum extent with a shoreline length of 87.53&amp;nbsp;km, shared between the Republic of Macedonia (56.02&amp;nbsp;km) and Albania (31.51&amp;nbsp;km). The lake drains an area of around 2600&amp;nbsp;km² and is fed primarily by underground springs on the eastern shore (about 50% of total inflow), with roughly 25% shares from rivers and direct precipitation. Over 20% of the lake's water comes from nearby Lake Prespa, about {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the southeast and at 150 m higher altitude than Lake Ohrid. 
[[File:Ohrid and Prespa lakes topographic map.svg|thumb|200px|right|Topographic map of Lakes Ohrid and Prespa|alt=map showing Lakes Ohrid and Prespa and the surrounding rivers, mountains, etc.]]
While Lake Ohrid is special as such, by far the most spectacular quality is its impressive endemism. Similar to [[Lake Baikal]] or [[Lake Tanganyika]], Lake Ohrid harbors endemic species covering the whole food-chain, from [[phytoplankton]] and sestile algae (20 species; e.g., Cyclotella fottii), over plant species (2 species; e.g., Chara ohridana), zooplankton (5 species; e.g., Cyclops ochridanus), [[cyprinid]] fish (8 species; e.g., Pachychilon pictus), to predatory fish (2 trout species; [[Ohrid trout]] Salmo letnica and "Belvica" Acantholingua ohridana) and finally its diverse endemic bottom fauna (176 species; e.g. Ochridagammarus solidus), with particularly large endemism among [[crustacean]]s, [[mollusc]]s, sponges and [[planarian]]s.

There are three cities on the lake's shores: [[Ohrid]] and [[Struga]] on the Macedonian side; [[Pogradec]] in Albania. There are also several fishing villages, although tourism is now a more significant part of their income. The catchment area of the lake has a population of around 170,000 people, with 131,000 people living directly at the lake shore (43,000 in Albania and 88,000 in the Republic of Macedonia).

==== Lake Prespa ====
{{Main|Lake Prespa}}
[[File:Prespa-ostrov.jpg|thumb|200px|right|View of the island of [[Golem Grad]] in Lake Prespa|alt=The island of Golem Grad in Lake Prespa]]

The Great Prespa Lake (Macedonian: Преспанско Езеро, Prespansko Ezero) is divided between Albania, Greece and the Republic of Macedonia. The biggest island in the Great Prespa Lake, on the Republic of Macedonia's side, is called ''[[Golem Grad]]'' ("Large Fortress"), or Snake Island (Змиски Остров). The other island ''Mal Grad'' ("Small Fortress", in Albania) is the site of a ruined 14th century monastery dedicated to [[St. Peter]]. Today, both islands are uninhabited. (See also: [[List of islands of the Republic of Macedonia]]).

Because Great Prespa Lake sits about 150m above Lake Ohrid, which lies only about {{convert|10|km|mi|abbr=on}} to the west, its waters run through underground channels in the [[karst]] and emerge from springs which feed streams running into Lake Ohrid.

==== Dojran Lake ====
{{Main|Dojran Lake}}

Dojran Lake, located in southeastern Macedonia, is the smallest of the three major lakes with an area of 42.7&amp;nbsp;km². It is shared between the Republic of Macedonia (27.1&amp;nbsp;km²) and Greece (15.6&amp;nbsp;km²).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cybermacedonia.com/lakesdoj.html |title=Lake Dojran |publisher=Cyber Macedonia |year=2001 |accessdate=1 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090707035025/http://www.cybermacedonia.com/lakesdoj.html |archivedate=7 July 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The town of [[Dojran]] is situated on the west coast of the lake, while the Greek village of [[Mouries]] lies to the east. To the north is the mountain [[Belasica]] and to the south is the Greek town of [[Doirani]]. The lake is round in shape, has a maximum depth of 10 metres, has a north-to-south length of 8.9&amp;nbsp;km, and is 7.1&amp;nbsp;km at its widest.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.exploringmacedonia.com/?ItemID=817A860778ED85498E53827EA52860C7 |title=Lake Dojran |publisher=National Tourism Portal of the Republic of Macedonia |date= |accessdate=1 September 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209230026/http://www.exploringmacedonia.com/?ItemID=817A860778ED85498E53827EA52860C7 |archivedate=9 February 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flora and fauna ===
[[File:Pinus peuce Habitus BotGardBln0906.jpg|thumb|150px|left|''[[Pinus peuce]]'', the Macedonian pine or molika, one of Macedonia's most recognizable trees|alt=a tall green tree]]
The flora of Macedonia is represented with around 210 [[Family (biology)|families]], 920 [[Genus (biology)|genera]], and around 3,700 plant [[species]]. The most abundant group are the [[flowering plant]]s with around 3,200 species, which is followed by mosses (350 species) and [[fern]]s (42).

[[Phytogeography|Phytogeographically]], Macedonia belongs to the Illyrian province of the [[Circumboreal Region]] within the [[Boreal Kingdom]]. According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]] and Digital Map of European Ecological Regions by the [[European Environment Agency]], the territory of the Republic can be subdivided into four [[ecoregion]]s: the [[Pindus Mountains]] [[mixed forests]], [[Balkan]] [[mixed forests]], [[Rhodopes]] [[mixed forests]] and [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] [[sclerophyllous]] and [[mixed forests]].

The fauna of Macedonian forests is abundant and includes bears, [[wild boar]]s, [[wolf|wolves]], foxes, [[squirrel]]s, [[chamois]] and [[deer]]. The [[Eurasian lynx|lynx]] is found, although very rarely, in the mountains of western Macedonia, while deer can be found in the region of [[Demir Kapija]]. Forest birds include the [[blackcap]], the [[grouse]], the [[black grouse]], the [[Eastern imperial eagle|imperial eagle]] and the forest owl.

The three artificial lakes of the country represent a separate fauna zone, an indication of long-lasting territorial and temporal isolation. The fauna of Lake Ohrid is a relict of an earlier era and the lake is widely known for its letnica trout, [[lake whitefish]], [[Gudgeon (fish)|gudgeon]], [[Rutilus|roach]], podust, and pior, as well as for certain species of snails of a genus older than 30&amp;nbsp;million years; similar species can only be found in [[Lake Baikal]]. Lake Ohrid is also noted in zoology texts for the [[European eel]] and its baffling reproductive cycle: it comes to Lake Ohrid from the [[Sargasso Sea]], located in the Atlantic Ocean, and lurks in the depths of the lake for ten years. When sexually mature, the eel is driven by unexplained instincts in the autumn to return to its point of birth. There it spawns and dies, leaving its offspring to seek out Lake Ohrid to begin the cycle anew.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.macedonia.co.uk/client/index1.aspx?page=247 |title=Macedonian Fauna |publisher=Macedonia.co.uk |date= |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Minerals and ores ===
Macedonia is rich in low-grade [[iron]] ore, [[copper]], [[lead]], [[zinc]], [[chromite]], [[manganese]], [[nickel]], [[tungsten]], [[gold]], [[silver]], [[asbestos]], and [[gypsum]]. Also it is one of possibly two places in the world where the [[lorandite]] mineral is found.

=== Land use ===
* 16.1% of the country's territory is [[arable land]].
* 1.36% of permanent [[crop]]s
* 82.54% – other. (2011).

According to 2004 estimates, there are 1278&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of irrigated land, and 6.4&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; of total renewable water resources.

=== Degradation and protection of the environment ===
[[File:Balkan Fires, Earth from Aqua (EOS PM-1) (2007-07-25).jpg|150px|thumb|The [[Balkans]] in July 2007, fires were particularly visible in Greece, Albania and Macedonia|alt=Photo of the Balkans taken from space showing wildfires]]

In July 2007, fires were particularly visible in Greece, Albania and Macedonia.

The environment is preserved in areas impractical and sparsely populated. In addition, the country has three major national parks, created under the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] regime of 1948–1958. The parks of Pelister, Mavrovo and Galičica cover an area of {{convert|108250|acre|km2}} and allow for the protection of natural areas by their exceptional geological setting, their fauna and flora. The ornithological reserve of Ezerani, north of [[Lake Prespa]], is 2,000 hectares big and is home to sixty animals protected by the [[Convention on the Conservation of European Wildlife and Natural Habitats|Bern Convention]].

However, if it is protected where man has little access, nature is threatened the outskirts of towns and villages. Indeed, in order to make Macedonia, formerly rural and poor, a modern and prosperous country, the Yugoslav communist regime established many factories, often highly polluting. These factories, located mainly in the regions of [[Veles (city)|Veles]] and Skopje are still functioning. The emissions of waste pollutants have decreased after 1991, after independence, because many companies have gone bankrupt or have reduced their activity after the transition to a market economy.

The other danger of degradation of nature lies in waste. Indeed, only the city of Skopje has a processing center for household waste in the rest of the country, so they are left in open dumps. The lack of resources and political will behind these fatal neglect for the environment.

Macedonia is also experiencing serious problems in water management. The country, however should be able to secure its water through its dams and its sources. In summer, water restrictions are common.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://balkans.courriers.info/article11084.html |title=Drought: the waste and mismanagement put Macedonia on the wagon, Courrier des Balkans, August&amp;nbsp;23, 2008 |publisher=Balkans.courriers.info |date= |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The summer period is also marked by the devastation of forests by wildfire.&lt;ref&gt;[http://tf1.lci.fr/infos/monde/europe/0,,3504745,00-feu-ravage-europe-sud-.html TF1-LCI.fr – Fire – Fire ravaged southern Europe, 28 July 2007] {{fr icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008, six million trees were planted in Macedonia to regenerate damaged forests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.terradaily.com/reports/Macedonia_plants_six_million_trees_to_revive_fire-ravaged_forests_999.html |title=Macedonia plants six million trees to revive fire-ravaged forests, 19 novembre 2008 |publisher=TerraDaily |date= |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The environmental degradation nevertheless mobilizes local groups and Macedonia is a signatory to international treaties like the [[Kyoto Protocol]].&lt;ref name="world factbook"&gt;[https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/mk.html CIA The World Factbook – Macedonia]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Differences in population and urbanization ===
[[File:Прилеп-панорама.jpg|thumb|left|200px|Panorama of [[Prilep]] and the plain of [[Pelagonia]]|alt=the red-roofed buildings of Prilep and surrounding mountains and vallies]]
The Republic of Macedonia consists primarily of rural country towns, with only 45% of the population concentrated in the larger towns and cities. Skopje, with more than 500,000 inhabitants, is by far the largest city in the country. The surrounding region, one of the few plains of the country, includes several other cities, like [[Tetovo]] and [[Gostivar]]. [[Bitola]], [[Prilep]] and other significant cities, are located in the plain of Pelagonia in the south. The rest of the population is concentrated in the valley of the Vardar and the few other basins and plains of the country.

[[Urbanization]], which is developing very fast since the communist era of Yugoslavia, has led to uncontrolled and illegal constructions.  Other cities have not grown as fast as the capital, which has gained more than 300,000 inhabitants between 1948 and 1981. Bitola, Prilep and [[Kumanovo]], the three other major cities, did not exceed 30,000 inhabitants in 1948 and have barely reached 100,000 people since. Kumanovo, which is the second largest city of Macedonia, had only 105,000 inhabitants in 2002, which is substantial difference comparing it with the population of the capital Skopje – 506,000 inhabitants.

Municipalities in the northwest frequently have Albanian majorities, and a couple with Turkish majorities. Almost all of the rest have Macedonian majorities]]

The [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonians]] are the largest ethnic group in the country,  accounting for 64.2% of the total population, according to the 2002 census. They speak the [[Macedonian language]] and most are [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]]. [[Albanians in the Republic of Macedonia|Ethnic Albanians]] are the country's largest minority, making up one-quarter of the total population. They live mainly in the west and northwest. The [[Turks in the Republic of Macedonia|Turks]], who comprise nearly 4% of the population, are mostly scattered, though they form a majority in two municipalities ([[Plasnica Municipality|Plasnica]] and [[Centar Župa Municipality|Centar Župa]]). The [[Romani people|Romani]] make up 2.7% of the population and are also concentrated throughout Macedonia, while the [[Serbs in the Republic of Macedonia|Serbs]], who form just under 2% of the total population, live mostly in the north of the country.&lt;ref name="world factbook"/&gt;

=== Administrative divisions ===
{{Main|Statistical regions of the Republic of Macedonia|Municipalities of the Republic of Macedonia}}
[[File:MKD muni nonn Rural-Urban-fr.png|thumb|left|200px|Map of the Macedonian municipalities (urban municipalities in blue, are distinguished from rural municipalities which are in green)|alt=Map of Macedonia showing which municipalities are rural and which are urban]]

Macedonia is divided into eight statistical regions: [[Skopje statistical region|Skopje]], [[Pelagonia statistical region|Pelagonia]], [[Polog statistical region|Polog]], [[Vardar statistical region|Vardar]], [[Eastern statistical region|Eastern]], [[Southeastern statistical region|Southeastern]], [[Northeastern statistical region|Northeastern]] and [[Southwestern statistical region|Southwestern]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stat.gov.mk/english/katalog.asp?bg=1&amp;pg=1.03 |title=General and Regional Statistics |publisher=State Statistical Office of the Republic of Macedonia |date= |accessdate=31 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101113145247/http://www.stat.gov.mk/english/katalog.asp?bg=1&amp;pg=1.03 |archivedate=13 November 2010 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The country is further divided into 84 municipalities. Until 1996, there were 123 municipalities, but several laws aimed at increasing the rights of minorities decreased the number of municipalities and modified their overall role. Skopje, the nation's capital, is itself divided into ten municipalities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.statoids.com/umk.html |title=Municipalities of Macedonia |publisher=Statoids.com |date= |accessdate=23 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Economic geography ==
Macedonia, like most countries in Eastern Europe, has a developing economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imf.org/external/pubs/ft/weo/2010/01/weodata/groups.htm#oem |title=IMF Emerging and Developing Economies List |publisher=World Economic Outlook Database |date=April 2010 |accessdate=25 August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Under Yugoslavia, Macedonia saw the establishment of many factories and the significant modernisation of the country, especially after the devastating [[1963 Skopje earthquake|Skopje earthquake of 1963]]. Since independence in 1991, Macedonia has suffered the transition to market economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://web.ceu.hu/cens/assets/files/publications/Exec_Economy_Macedonia |title=The Economy of Macedonia since Transition |publisher=Central European University |date= |accessdate=25 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110719195504/http://web.ceu.hu/cens/assets/files/publications/Exec_Economy_Macedonia |archivedate=19 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Greece, which believes that the republic is monopolising the cultural and historical heritage of Macedonia, imposed an embargo in 1993 and has prevented the country's accession to organisations like the [[European Union]] and [[NATO]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/09/14/world/greece-to-lift-embargo-against-macedonia-if-it-scraps-its-flag.html?scp=1&amp;sq=Greece%20to%20Lift%20Embargo%20Against%20Macedonia%20if%20It%20Scraps%20Its%20Flag%20&amp;st=cse |title=Greece to Lift Embargo Against Macedonia if It Scraps Its Flag |publisher=New York Times |date=14 September 1995 |accessdate=25 August 2010 | first=Christopher S. | last=Wren}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1995, the Greek embargo was lifted and Macedonia was able to access the IMF and World Bank. The country still suffers, however, from its isolation and lack of foreign investment. In 2007, the unemployment rate was estimated at 32% and the [[black market]] provided about 20% of the Gross Domestic Product.&lt;ref name="world factbook"/&gt;

=== Characteristics and advantages ===
The Republic of Macedonia's geographical positioning provides it with many advantages. One advantage is the geographical position of the country. It is the center of the [[Balkans]], between [[Belgrade]] and [[Athens]], [[Tirana]] and [[Sofia]], between the [[Adriatic]] and Black Sea. The Vardar valley forms a natural corridor, which connects Greece to the rest of Europe. This corridor is crossed by the highway E75, which crosses in Europe and connects Scandinavia with [[Attica]]. This highway has also been renovated in Macedonia with the [[European Agency for Reconstruction]], and the communication channels that connect the Adriatic to the Black Sea, called the Corridor VIII, were also upgraded and maintained through international assistance including the [[Italia]]n one.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corridor8.org/index2.php?page=corridor_single&amp;id=1 |title=Secretariat Corridor8.it |publisher=Corridor8.org |date=9 February 2010 |accessdate=23 August 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110725200230/http://www.corridor8.org/index2.php?page=corridor_single&amp;id=1 |archivedate=25 July 2011 |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Macedonia is also rich with minerals. The country in fact has substantial deposits of [[chromium]] and other nonferrous metals like [[copper]], [[zinc]], [[manganese]] and [[nickel]].&lt;ref name="world factbook"/&gt; The country also has gypsum mines,&lt;ref name="world factbook"/&gt; [[marble]] and [[granite]], located in Pelagonia. [[Lignite]], provides 80% of the Macedonian electricity. In addition to mines and quarries, the country has large cement plants and large complexes of metal, created by the communist regime.

[[Agriculture]] is encouraged by the significant water resources, managed by dams and canals. The presence of hot springs of volcanic origin can heat the greenhouses in winter, particularly in the [[Strumica]] region, whose products include [[tomato]]es and [[cucumber]]s in the month of February. Different climates provide opportunities for various productions in the geographical area, so the [[vine]] and [[tobacco]] are operated in the south, the [[rice]] in the region of [[Kočani]] which is largely irrigated, and the wood industry is concentrated around [[Štip]].&lt;ref&gt;Dominique Auzias and Jean-Paul Labourdette, ''cit.'', p. 182&lt;/ref&gt; Agriculture contributes a significant share of exports, especially with the wine and tobacco. The low cost of labor also helps the textile industry.

{{Politics of Egypt}}

For administrative purposes, [[Egypt]] is divided into twenty-seven [[governorates]] ({{lang|ar|محافظة}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|muḥāfaẓah}}''; {{IPA-arz|moˈħɑfzˤɑ}}; [[genitive case#Arabic|genitive case]]: ''{{transl|ar|ALA|muḥāfaẓat&amp;nbsp;}}'' {{IPA-arz|moˈħɑfzˤet|}}; plural: {{lang|ar|محافظات}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|muḥāfaẓāt&amp;nbsp;}}''{{IPA-arz|moħɑfˈzˤɑːt|}}).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Governorates of Egypt|url=http://www.statoids.com/ueg.html|website=Statoids|accessdate=16 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Egyptian governorates are the top tier of the country's jurisdiction hierarchy. A governorate is administered by a governor, who is appointed by the [[President of Egypt]] and serves at the president's discretion. Most governorates have a population density of more than one thousand per km², while the three largest have a population density of less than two per km².

==Overview==
Governorates are either fully "urban" or a mixture of "urban" and "rural." The official distinction between "urban" and "rural" is reflected in the lower tiers: that is, fully urban governorates have no regions (''[[Regions of Egypt|markaz]]''), as the ''markaz'' is, natively, a conglomeration of villages. Moreover, governorates may comprise just one city, as in the case of [[Cairo Governorate]] or [[Alexandria Governorate]]. Hence, these one-city governorates are only divided into districts (urban neighborhoods). [[Cairo Governorate]] consists of 41 districts; [[Alexandria Governorate]] consists of 7.

Two new governorates were created in April 2008: [[Helwan Governorate|Helwan]] and [[6th of October Governorate|6th of October]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/894/eg6.htm |title=Redrawing the map |accessdate=2008-05-19 |author=Reem Leila |work=Al Ahram Weekly (On-line) |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090810065313/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2008/894/eg6.htm |archivedate=2009-08-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, however, the 6th of October and Helwan governorates were again incorporated into the [[Cairo Governorate|Cairo]] and [[Giza Governorate|Giza]] Governorates, respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://english.ahram.org.eg/NewsContent/1/0/10037/Egypt/Egypts-PM-centralises-Helwan-and--October-governor.aspx|title=Egypt's PM centralises Helwan and 6 October governorates  - Egypt - Ahram Online|website=english.ahram.org.eg}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Luxor Governorate|Luxor]] was created in December 2009, to be the 29th governorate of Egypt, but with the abolition of the 6th of October and Helwan governorates, the number of governorates has decreased to 27.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.thedailynewsegypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=26302 |title=Luxor announced Egypt’s 29th governorate |accessdate=2009-12-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100213171023/http://thedailynewsegypt.com/article.aspx?ArticleID=26302 |archivedate=February 13, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Before the [[Egyptian revolution of 1952|1952 revolution]], state penetration of the rural areas was limited by the power of local notables. Under [[Gamal Abdel Nasser|Nasser]], [[Land reform in Egypt|land reform]] reduced those notables socioeconomic dominance, and the peasants were incorporated into cooperatives which transferred mass dependence from landlords to the government. The extension of officials into the countryside permitted the regime to bring development and services to the village. The local branches of the ruling party, the [[Arab Socialist Union (Egypt)|Arab Socialist Union]] (ASU), fostered a certain peasant political activism and coopted the local notables — in particular the village headmen — and checked their independence from the regime.&lt;ref name="CountryStudy"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Metz, ed|first1=Helen Chapin|title=Egypt: A Country Study.|date=1990|publisher=Washington: GPO for the Library of Congress|url=http://countrystudies.us/egypt/113.htm|accessdate=21 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

State penetration did not retreat under [[Anwar Sadat|Sadat]] and [[Hosni Mubarak|Mubarak]]. The earlier effort to mobilize peasants and deliver services disappeared as the local party and cooperative withered, but administrative controls over the peasants remained intact. The local power of the old families and the headmen revived but more at the expense of peasants than of the state. The district police station balanced the notables, and the system of local government (the mayor and council) integrated them into the regime.&lt;ref name="CountryStudy" /&gt;

Until 1979, local government enjoyed limited power in Egypt's highly centralized state. Under the central government, there were twenty-six governorates, which were subdivided into regions (conglomeration of villages; named in {{lang-ar|مركز}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|markaz&amp;nbsp;}}'' "center", plural: {{lang|ar|مراكز}} ''{{transl|ar|ALA|marākiz}}''&lt;span style="margin:2.5px;"&gt;)&lt;/span&gt;, each of which was further subdivided into towns or villages.&lt;ref name="CountryStudy" /&gt; At each level, there was a governing structure that combined representative councils and government-appointed executive organs headed by governors, district officers, and mayors, respectively. Governors were appointed by the president, and they, in turn, appointed subordinate executive officers. The coercive backbone of the state apparatus ran downward from the Ministry of Interior through the governors' executive organs to the district police station and the village headman.&lt;ref name="CountryStudy" /&gt;

Sadat took several measures to decentralize power to the provinces and towns. Governors acquired more authority under Law Number 43 of 1979, which reduced the administrative and budgetary controls of the central government over the provinces. The elected councils acquired, at least formally, the right to approve or disapprove the local budget. In an effort to reduce local demands on the central treasury, local government was given wider powers to raise local taxes. Local representative councils became vehicles of pressure for government spending, and the soaring deficits of local government bodies had to be covered by the central government. Local government was encouraged to enter into joint ventures with private investors, and these ventures stimulated an alliance between government officials and the local rich that paralleled the [[infitah]] alliance at the national level. Under Mubarak, decentralization and local autonomy became more of a reality, and local policies often reflected special local conditions. Thus, officials in Upper Egypt often bowed to the powerful Islamic movement there, while those in the port cities struck alliances with importers."&lt;ref name="CountryStudy" /&gt;

'''Harris Geospatial Solutions''' provides software for the analysis and visualization of scientific data and imagery. The company develops products such as [[IDL (programming language)|IDL]], ENVI and IAS which are used in a variety of industries, including [[remote sensing]], engineering, geology, aerospace, defense and intelligence, and [[medical imaging]].

==History==
When a group of scientists who developed the [[Mariner 6 and 7|Mariner Mars]] space probes in 1977, David Stern, who was working at the [[University of Colorado]] developed a programming language called Mariner Mars Spectral Editor, which later evolved to [[IDL (programming language)|IDL]], Interactive Data Language, in order to supplement [[FORTRAN]], specifically for data analysis and visualization at that time. As his vision developed, Stern left the university and started working in his attic to improve the programming language. He incorporated Research Systems Inc. (RSI) and released IDL as a proprietary programming language for visualizing data. [[NASA]] [[Goddard Space Center]] and [[Ball Aerospace]] were ones of the company's early customers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.exelisvis.com/Company/Mission,VisionValues/ExelisVISHistory.aspx|publisher=Exelis VIS|title=Exelis VIS History|accessdate=2015-04-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, the software package, ENVI, was released. Written in IDL, ENVI enhanced the text-based IDL and enabled a suite of [[graphical user interface]]s specialized in [[remote sensing]] imagery analysis. RSI was acquired by [[Eastman Kodak]] as a wholly owned subsidiary in 2000. Four years later, RSI along with the Remote Sensing Systems division of Eastman Kodak, were sold to [[ITT Corporation]] and were renamed ITT Visual Information Solutions.

In 2011, ITT Corporation was divided into three standalone companies, and ITT Visual Information Solutions became part of [[Exelis Inc.]] along with ITT Defense and Information Solutions. ITT Visual Information Solutions was renamed again to the current Exelis Visual Information Solutions.

In 2015 Exelis Visual Information Solutions was purchased by the Harris Corporation, becoming Harris Geospatial Solutions.

'''Helgalund''', '''Helgalunden''', or '''Tjurberget''', is a  [[neighbourhood]] on the island [[Södermalm]] in [[Stockholm]], [[Sweden]]. The picturesque area was designed by architect and city planner [[Per Olof Hallman]], c. 1930.

The neighbourhood is located on the hill Tjurberget with [[park]]s in the north and south.  At the centre of Helgalund is Allhelgonakyrkan, the "Church of all saints," in the grove Helgalunden, from which the area takes its name.  The eight groves of Rosenlundsparken, Tjurbergsgatan, Blekingegatan, Götgatan, Dalslandsgatan, Tjurberget, Assesorsgatan, and Grindsgatan roughly make up the borders of the area.

==Voting statistics==
Helgalund is divided between the [[constituency|constituencies]] of ''Katarina 9-12'' and the inhabitants tend to vote [[leftist]]:

In 2002:

* 15-20% were for the [[Vänsterpartiet|Left Party]] in 2002
* 25-35% were for the [[Socialdemokratiska arbetarpartiet|Social Democrats]]
* 7-12% were for the [[Miljöpartiet|Green Party]].

Other groups:

* [[Moderate Party|Conservatives]] 11-18%
* [[Liberal People's Party (Sweden)|Liberals]] 14-20%
* [[Kristdemokraterna|Christian Democrats]] 3-6%
* [[Centerpartiet|Center Party]] 1-2%
* Others 2-3%

Helgalund is home to the [[National Academy of Mime and Acting]], as well as a bust of actress [[Greta Garbo]].

The '''Hong Kong International Convention for the safe and environmentally sound recycling of ships''', or '''Hong Kong Convention''' is a mulitateral convention adopted in 2009, which has not entered into force. The conference that created the convention was attended by 63 countries, and overseen by the [[International Maritime Organization]] (IMO), which is a specialist agency of the United Nations (U.N).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.imo.org/|title=International Maritime Organization|work=imo.org|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The convention has been designed to try to improve the health and safety of current [[ship breaking]] practices. Ship breaking is considered to be "amongst the most dangerous of occupations, with unacceptably high levels of fatalities, injuries and work-related diseases"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilo.org/safework/areasofwork/hazardous-work/WCMS_110335/lang--en/index.htm|title=IShip-breaking: a hazardous work|work=ilo.org|accessdate=18 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; by the [[ILO]] as large ships are often beached and then dismantled by hand by workers with very little [[personal protective equipment]] (PPE). This is most common in Asia, with India, Bangladesh, [[China]], and Pakistan holding the largest ship breaking yards.&lt;ref&gt;Mikelis, Nikos.http://www.imo.org/includes/blastDataOnly.asp/data_id%3D23449/shiprecycling.pdf "A statistical overview of ship recycling", September 2007. Retrieved on 22 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hong Kong Convention recognised that [[ship recycling]] is the most environmentally sound way to dispose of a ship at the end of its life, as most of the ship's materials can be reused. However, it sees current methods as unacceptable. The work sees many injuries and fatalities to workers, as they lack the correct [[safety equipment]] to handle the large ship correctly as it is dismantled and most vessels contain a large amount of [[hazardous material]]s such as [[asbestos]], [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]], [[Tributyltin|TBT]], and [[Chlorofluorocarbon|CFCs]], which can also lead to highly life-threatening diseases such as [[mesothelioma]] and lung cancer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/Sites-Types/mesothelioma |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100906150654/http://www.cancer.gov/cancertopics/factsheet/sites-types/mesothelioma |archivedate=6 September 2010 |df=dmy-all }} Retrieved on 22 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Inventory of Hazardous Materials==
The ''Inventory of Hazardous Materials'' has been designed to try to minimise the dangers of these hazards. The Convention defines a hazard as: “any material or substance which is liable to create hazards to [[human health]] and/or the [[Natural environment|environment]]".&lt;ref&gt;http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/ships/pdf/Convention.pdf Retrieved on 22 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

All vessels over 500 gross tonnes (GT) that are in commercial service (the convention does not apply to [[warship]]s or [[naval auxiliary]] or ships operating their whole life only in waters subject to the sovereignty or jurisdiction of the State whose flag the ship is entitled to fly) will have to comply with the convention once it comes into force. Each party that does wish to comply must restrict the use of hazardous materials on all ships that fly the flag of that party.&lt;ref&gt;International Maritime Organization http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/ships/pdf/Convention.pdf 'agenda item 8' Retrieved on 11 March 2015&lt;/ref&gt;

New ships must all carry an Inventory of Hazardous Materials. The inventory will list all 'hazardous materials' on board the vessel, including their amounts and locations. Existing ships must comply no later than five years after the convention comes into force, or prior to being recycled if this occurs before the five-year period. The inventory will remain with a vessel throughout its lifespan, being updated as all new installations enter the ship, as these may potentially contain hazards. The presence of the inventory will then ensure the safety of crew members during the vessel's working life, and also the safety of workers during the recycling process.

The convention was open for signature between 1 September 2009 and 31 August 2010, and remained open for accession afterwards. It will enter into force two years after "15 states, representing 40% of the world merchant shipping by gross tonnage, and on average 3% of recycling tonnage for the previous 10 years, have either signed it without reservation as to [[ratification]], acceptance or approval, or have deposited instruments of ratification, acceptance, approval or accession with the Secretary General".&lt;ref&gt;http://www.imo.org/Environment/mainframe.asp?topic_id=818 Retrieved on 22 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt; None of these conditions was met as of 2017:

==Relation to EU instruments==
The EU Ship Recycling Regulation &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ec.europa.eu/environment/waste/ships/|title=Ship recycling - Waste - Environment - European Commission|work=europa.eu|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; entered into force on 30 December 2013. Although this regulation closely follows the Hong Kong convention, there are important differences. The Regulation sets out a number of requirements for European ships, European ship owners, ship recycling facilities willing to recycle European ships, and the relevant competent authorities or administrations. It also requires the Commission to adopt a number of acts implementing the Regulation (in particular the European List of ship recycling facilities authorized to recycle ships flying the Union flag). For the Inventory of Hazardous Materials required by the EU regulation, there are additional substances listed as prohibited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://eur-lex.europa.eu/legal-content/EN/TXT/?uri=CELEX:52012PC0118|title=EUR-Lex - 52012PC0118 - EN - EUR-Lex|work=europa.eu|accessdate=18 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''hummock''' is a small knoll or mound above ground.&lt;ref name="Bates"&gt;Bates, Robert L. and Julia A. Jackson, ed. (1984). “hummock.” Dictionary of Geological Terms, 3rd Ed. New York: Anchor Books. p. 241.&lt;/ref&gt; They are typically less than 15 meters in height and tend to appear in groups or fields. It is difficult to make generalizations about hummocks because of the diversity in their morphology and sedimentology.&lt;ref name="Grab"&gt;Grab, Stefan. (2003). “Aspects of the geomorphology, genesis and environmental significance of earth hummocks (thufur, pounus): miniature cryogenic mounds.” ''[[Progress in Physical Geography]]'' 29, 2. p. 139-155.
&lt;/ref&gt; An extremely irregular surface may be called ''hummocky''.&lt;ref name="Willams"&gt;Willams, Peter J. and Michael W. Smith. (1989). The Frozen Earth: Fundamentals of Geocryology. Cambridge, UK: Cambridge UP, p. 149-163.&lt;/ref&gt;

An ice hummock is a boss or rounded knoll of ice rising above the general level of an ice-field. Hummocky ice is caused by slow and unequal pressure in the main body of the packed ice, and by unequal structure and temperature at a later period.

== Bog hummocks ==
Hummocks in the shape of low ridges of drier peat moss typically form part of the structure of certain types of [[raised bog]], such as [[plateau bog|plateau]], [[kermi bog|kermi]], [[palsa bog|palsa]] or [[string bog]]. The hummocks alternate with shallow wet depressions or [[flark]]s.

==Swamp hummocks== 
'''Swamp hummocks''' are mounds typically initiated as fallen trunks or branches covered with moss and rising above the swamp floor. The low-lying areas between hummocks are called hollows.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.amjbot.org/content/91/8/1251.full&lt;/ref&gt; A related term, used in the [[Southeastern United States]], is "[[Hammock (ecology)|hammock]]".

==Earth hummocks of cryogenic origin==
[[Image:frost upheaval.jpg|thumb|Cryogenic earth hummocks on [[Mount Kenya]]]]
[[Cryogenic]] earth hummocks go by many different names; in North America they are earth hummocks; thúfur in Greenland and Iceland; and pounus in [[Fennoscandia]]. These cold climate landforms appear in regions of [[permafrost]] and seasonally frozen ground.&lt;ref name="Grab"/&gt; They usually develop in fine-grained soils with light to moderate vegetation in areas of low relief where there is adequate moisture to fuel cryogenic processes.&lt;ref name="Davis"&gt;Davis, Neil. (2001). Permafrost: A Guide to Frozen Ground in Transition. Fairbanks, Alaska: University of Alaska Press. p. 133, 137-40, 146, 175-76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cryogenic earth hummocks appear in a variety of cold-ground environments, making the story of their genesis complex. Geologists recognize that hummocks may be polygenetic and form by a combination of forces that are yet to be well understood.&lt;ref name="Grab"/&gt;

Recent research on cryogenic hummocks has focused on their role as environmental indicators. Because hummocks can both form and disintegrate rapidly (well within a human lifetime)&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; they are an ideal landform to monitor for medium range environmental change.&lt;ref name="Grab"/&gt; There are several explanations of earth hummock formation.

===Cryoexpulsion of clasts===
Hummocks may form as a result of clasts migrating to the surface through frost push and pull mechanisms. As the clasts rise they push up on the ground above forming bulging mounds.&lt;ref name="Grab"/&gt;

===Cellular circulation===
Hummock excavation normally reveals a disturbed soil profile, often with irregular streaks of organic matter or other colorations suggesting fluidity at some time past.&lt;ref name="Davis"/&gt; The disturbance, a form of [[cryoturbation]] often extends to a depth roughly equal to the hummock’s height. This has been explained by some as the result of convection processes whereby warmer soil and water at depth expands, becomes less dense and rises, while gravity forces denser soil downwards. Circulation has also been explained as driven solely by density of soil material, not temperature induced density changes.&lt;ref name="Willams"/&gt;

===Differential frost heave (cryostatic pressure hypothesis)===
This is the most widely accepted explanation of [[Cryogenics|cryogenic]] hummock genesis.&lt;ref name="Grab"/&gt; Irregularities in preexisting ground conditions (differences in grain size, ground temperature, moisture conditions of vegetation) cause surface downwards freezing during the winter to spread unevenly. Encroaching frost exerted increasing pressure on the adjacent unfrozen soil. Trapped between the freezing surface soils and the buried permafrost layer the soil material is forced upwards into hummocks. While this is currently the most commonly accepted hypothesis, there is still only limited evidence of this happening.&lt;ref name="Willams"/&gt;

==Hummocks created by debris avalanches==
Debris avalanches are caused by sudden collapses of large volumes of rock from the flanks of mountains, especially volcanoes.&lt;ref&gt;Reubi, O, Ross, P. S., &amp; White, J.D.L. (2005). Debris Avalanche deposits associated with large igneous province volcanism: An example from the Mawson Formation, central Allan Hills, Antarctica. Geological Society of America Bulletin. p. 117, 1612-1627.&lt;/ref&gt; These events are fast-moving, gravity-driven currents of saturated debris that do not necessarily include juvenile material.&lt;ref name="Francis"&gt;Francis, P, &amp; Oppenheimer, C (2003). Volcanoes. Oxford: Oxford University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Debris avalanche deposits are characterized by the debris-avalanche block (hummocks) and the debris-avalanche matrix. Debris avalanches are diagnosed for landscapes where the volcano has an amphitheater at the source with hummocky terrain downhill. In some cases, such as [[Mount Shasta]] in California, the amphitheater has been filled in by later volcanic activity and all that remains are the hummocks.&lt;ref name="Ui"&gt;Ui, T., Takarada, S., Yoshimoto, M., (2000). Debris Avalanches. In [[Haraldur Sigurdsson|Sigurdsson, H.]], Houghton, B.F (eds), Encyclopedia of Volcanoes. San Diego: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

Debris avalanche blocks are identifiable because they keep their internal stratigraphy. The blocks simply break off the mountain and slide down, completely intact, identifiable because they differ from the surrounding landscape.&lt;ref name="Francis"/&gt; The volume and height of hummocks is mostly dependent on their location; the closer to the source region, the larger they become.&lt;ref name="Ui"/&gt; The bottom layer of a debris avalanche deposit is the fine-grained matrix which forms due to the shear at the base of the large, turbulent moving mass.&lt;ref name="Francis"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1056">'''Iere Village''' is a small village in southern [[Trinidad]], north west of [[Princes Town]]. Though small in size, the village is rich in history. It is the site of the first [[Presbyterian]] church, the first [[Islamic]] mosque and the first government funded school in Trinidad. The village is located on the Naparima Mayaro Road just outside Princes Town. The village's primary school, Iere Government Primary, has been rebuilt and located further up the road from its original location on Richmond.

The '''Karakoram–Kunlun Tract''' is the mountainous region between [[Kashmir]] and the [[Tarim Basin]], which served as a historical frontier region between the two domains. Major rivers [[Yarkand River|Yarkand]] and [[Karakash River|Karakash]] that water the Tarim Basin originate in the [[Karakoram]] range and flow throw this region. It was also the region through which passed the trade between India and China throughout history as well as the spread of [[Buddhism]] to Central Asia and China.

'''La Mujer Muerta''' is a subrange of the [[Sierra de Guadarrama]], [[Sistema Central]], located in [[Segovia Province]], [[Spain]]. 

The silhouette of the mountain range takes the shape of a reclining woman with when seen from certain angles, hence its name which means "dead woman" in the [[Spanish language]]. The highest point is [[La Pinareja]] (2197 m).

==Television to radio transfers==
Some television series transfer in the other direction.  Both the [[science fiction]] series ''[[Doctor Who]]'' and ''[[Blake's 7]]'' have become short-lived radio series.  Several [[comedy|comedies]], such as ''[[To the Manor Born]]'' (in 1997) and ''[[One Foot in the Grave]]'', have also been transferred.

As another example, in 2004 the [[Andy Hamilton]] comedy ''[[Trevor's World of Sport]]'' transferred to Radio 4. Having largely failed in its television incarnation, it was felt the older medium might suit it better. This would seem to create the impression that, whereas popular radio shows are "promoted" to television, an unpopular television show was being "demoted" to radio. However, public opinion on the radio series has been mostly positive, suggesting that it was a good decision.

This is a '''list of [[airport]]s in the [[Maldives]]''', grouped by type and sorted by location.

The ''Maldives'' or ''Maldive Islands'', officially the ''Republic of Maldives'', is an [[island country]] in the [[Indian Ocean]] formed by a double chain of [[Atolls of the Maldives|twenty-six atolls]] stretching in a north-south direction off [[India]]'s [[Lakshadweep]] islands, between [[Minicoy Island]] and [[Chagos Archipelago]]. It stands in the [[Laccadive Sea]], about {{convert|700|km|0}} southwest of [[Sri Lanka]].

The [[atoll]]s of Maldives encompass a [[Territory (country subdivision)|territory]] spread over roughly {{convert|90000|km2|0}}, making it one of the most disparate countries in the world. It features 1,192 [[islets]], of which two hundred are inhabited. The Republic of Maldives's [[capital city|capital]] and largest city is [[Malé]].

Fatal [[bear attack]]s in North America have occurred in a variety of settings.  There have been several in the bears' [[wilderness]] [[habitat]]s involving hikers, hunters, and campers.   [[Brown bear]] incidents have occurred in their native range spanning [[Alaska]], [[Northern Canada|Northern]] and [[Western Canada]], and portions of the [[Rocky Mountains]] in the United States.  The locations of [[American black bear|black bear]] wilderness fatal attacks reflect their wider range: all Canadian Provinces except the [[Atlantic Canada|Atlantic Provinces]] and several major mountainous areas in the United States.

Bears held [[Captivity (animal)|captive]] by [[Animal training|animal trainers]], in [[zoos]], [[carnivals]], or kept as pets have been responsible for several attacks. There have also been unusual cases in which a person entered a bear's cage and was then mauled.

Bear attacks are rare in North America.&lt;ref name="outsideMarch2001"&gt;{{cite web |last=Fraser |first=Caroline |title=You Are in Bear Country |url=http://www.outsideonline.com/1891081/you-are-bear-country |work=Outside Magazine Online |accessdate=25 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="msnbc162009"&gt;{{cite web |last=Celizic |first=Mike |title=New TV show is unfair to bears, some experts growl |url=http://today.msnbc.msn.com/id/28519221 |work=MSNBC.com |accessdate=6 January 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nyt4July1995"&gt;{{cite news |title=Bear Kills Woman and Her Son in Alaska |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/04/us/bear-kills-woman-and-her-son-in-alaska.html |accessdate=8 July 2010 |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=4 July 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Attacks are for [[Predation|predatory]], [[Territory (animal)|territorial]], or [[Bear attack#Protecting young|protective]] reasons.&lt;ref name="stpaug21978"&gt;{{cite news |last=Klinkenberg |first=Jeff |title=This grizzly study was close up |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=zOkLAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=QVoDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3699,684466 |accessdate=6 January 2011 |newspaper=[[St. Petersburg Times]] |date=2 August 1978}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Most wilderness attacks have occurred when there were only one or two people in the vicinity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Herrero |first=Stephen |publisher=Globe Pequo |year=2002 |page=5 |isbn=1-58574-557-X |title=Bear Attacks: Their Causes and Avoidance |author-link=Stephen Herrero}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=journal_wildlife_2011&gt;{{cite journal |last=Herrero |first=Stephen |title=Fatal attacks by American black bear on people: 1900–2009 |journal=[[Journal of Wildlife Management]] |date=April 2011 |volume=75 |issue=3 |pages=596–603 |doi=10.1002/jwmg.72 |url=http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/jwmg.72/abstract |authorlink=Stephen Herrero}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In this list, three species of [[bear]] are recognized: the [[brown bear]] (''Ursus arctos'', commonly known as the [[grizzly bear]]), the [[American black bear]] (''Ursus americanus''), and the [[polar bear]] (''Ursus maritimus'').

A week later, another hunter seeking shelter from rain, investigated his cabin, which had been ransacked by a grizzly bear, and found Vetter dead in the cabin. A newspaper was found which had been written on in blood by Vetter before his death, describing his battle with a grizzly bear, and ending with the words "I'm dying." The hunter, and another man, searched for signs of the bear, and found Vetter's hat, two empty rifle shells, and his rifle with a shell jammed in its chamber.

The '''Maidenhead Locator System''' (a.k.a. '''QTH Locator''' and '''IARU Locator''') is a [[geographic coordinate system|geographic co-ordinate system]] used by [[amateur radio]] operators to succinctly describe their locations, which replaced the deprecated [[QRA locator]] that was limited to European [[Contact (amateur radio)|contact]]s.&lt;ref name="G4FTJ"&gt;{{cite book|title=Amateur Radio Operating Manual (third edition)|author=R. J. Eckersley, G4FTJ|publisher=[[Radio Society of Great Britain]]|year=1985|isbn=0-900612-69-X|location=Potters bar, UK|pages=64–66}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its purpose is to be concise, accurate and robust in the face of [[Interference (communication)|interference]] and adverse transmission conditions. The Maidenhead Locator System can describe locations anywhere in the world.

Maidenhead locators are also commonly referred to as ''QTH Locator'', ''grid locators'' or ''grid squares'', although the "squares" are distorted on any non-[[equirectangular projection|equirectangular]] [[cartographic projection]]. Use of the terms ''QTH locator'' and ''QRA locator'' was initially discouraged, as it caused confusion with the older QRA locator system. The only abbreviation recommended to indicate a Maidenhead reference in Morse code and radio teleprinter transmission was "LOC", as in "LOC KN28LH".&lt;ref name="G4FTJ"/&gt;

Dr. John Morris [[Amateur_radio#Call_signs|G4ANB]] originally devised the system and it was adopted at a meeting of the VHF Working Group in [[Maidenhead]], England in 1980.&lt;ref name=QRZ.RU-Locator_System/&gt;

==History==

[[DXing|DX]] [[contesting]] is scored based on the distance of [[Contact (amateur radio)|contact]]s, typically 1 point per kilometre,&lt;ref name="SM5AGM-Maidenhead"&gt;{{Cite web | title = The Locator System | author = Folke Rosvall, SM5AGM | website = jonit.com | accessdate = 2017-01-30 | url = http://www.jonit.com/fieldlist/maidenhead.htm }}&lt;/ref&gt; so there is a need for amateurs to exchange their locations over the air. To facilitate this, following the growth of the sport in the 1950s, the German&lt;ref name=QRZ.RU-Locator_System/&gt; [[QRA locator]] system was adopted in 1959. The QRA locator system was limited to describing European coordinates, however, and by the mid-1970s there was growing recognition for a need for a global locator system.&lt;ref name="SM5AGM-Maidenhead"/&gt;

By the time of their April 1980 meeting, in [[Maidenhead, England]], the VHF Working Group had received 20 different proposals to replace the QRA locator grid. That devised by Dr. John Morris G4ANB was deemed to be the best.&lt;ref name="SM5AGM-Maidenhead"/&gt;

At the 1999 [[International Amateur Radio Union|IARU]] Conference in Lillehammer it was decided that the latitude and longitude to be used as a reference for the determining of locators should be based on the [[World Geodetic System|World Geodetic System 1984]] (WGS-84).&lt;ref name=QRZ.RU-Locator_System&gt;{{cite web
|url=http://www.qrz.ru/vhf/qth_h.pdf
|title=The Locator System
|format=PDF
|accessdate=2014-07-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Description of the system==
[[Image:Maidenhead Locator System explained.svg|thumb|right]]
A Maidenhead locator compresses [[latitude]] and [[longitude]] into a short string of characters, which is similar in concept to the [[World Geographic Reference System]] or GEOREF.  This position information is presented in a limited level of precision to limit the number of characters needed for its transmission using voice, [[Morse code]], or any other operating mode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal
|author=Edmund Tyson, N5JTY|url-access=subscription|access-date=2018-03-09
|journal=QST
|title=Conversion between geodetic and grid locator systems
|url=http://www.arrl.org/files/file/protected/Group/Members/Technology/tis/info/pdf/18929.pdf
|publisher=The American Radio Relay League
|date=January 1989
|location=Newington, CT,
|pages=29–30,43
}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The chosen coding uses alternating pairs of letters and digits, like so:

* BL11bh16

In each pair, the first character encodes longitude and the second character encodes latitude.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web
|title = Maidenhead Grid Squares
|url = http://www.amsat.org/amsat/articles/houston-net/grids.html
|author = Bruce Paige, KK5DO
|publisher = [[AMSAT]]
|year = 2000
|accessdate=10 September 2012
}}&lt;/ref&gt; These character pairs also have traditional names, and in the case of letters, the range of characters (or "encoding base number") used in each pair does vary.

[[Image:Maidenhead Locator Map.png|thumb|The world is divided into 324 (18²) Maidenhead fields.]]
To avoid negative numbers in the input data, the system specifies that latitude is measured from the [[South Pole]] to the [[North Pole]], and longitude measured eastward from the [[antimeridian]] of [[Greenwich]], giving the [[Prime Meridian]] a [[easting and northing|false easting]] of 180° and the [[equator]] a [[easting and northing|false northing]] of 90°.

To simplify manual encoding, the base for the first pair of letters—traditionally called a ''field''—was chosen to be 18, thus dividing the globe into 18 zones of longitude of 20° each, and 18 zones of latitude 10° each. These zones are encoded with the letters "A" through "R".

[[Image:Maidenhead grid over Europe.svg|thumb|Fields are divided into 100 squares each.]]
The second pair of numbers, called a ''square'' and placed after the first pair of letters, uses a base number of 10, and is encoded using the digits "0" to "9".  This is where the alternative name "grid squares" comes from. Each of these squares represents 1° of latitude by 2° of longitude.
For additional precision, each square can optionally be sub-divided further, into ''subsquares''.  These are encoded into a second pair of letters, often (but not always) presented in lowercase. Again, to make manual calculations from degrees and minutes easier, 24 was chosen as the base number, giving these subsquares dimensions of 2.5' of latitude by 5' of longitude.  The letters used are "a" through "x".

The resulting Maidenhead subsquare locator string is hence composed of two letters, two digits, and two more letters.  To give an example, W1AW, the [[American Radio Relay League]]'s [[Hiram Percy Maxim]] Memorial Station in [[Newington, Connecticut]], is found in grid locator {{Coor Maidenhead|41.71463|-72.72713|yes}}. Two points within the same Maidenhead subsquare are always less than {{cvt|12|km|mi}} apart, which means a Maidenhead locator can give adequate precision from only six easily transmissible characters.

For even more precise location mapping, two additional digits were proposed and ratified as an ''extended locator'', making it altogether eight characters long, and dividing ''subsquares'' into even smaller ones.  Such precision has uses in very short communication spans.  Beyond this, no common definition exists to extend the system further into even smaller squares.  Most often the extending is done by repeating alternating subsquare and square rules (base numbers 24 and 10 respectively).  However, other bases for letter encodings have also been observed, and therefore such ''extended extended'' locators might not be compatible.

To summarise:
* Character pairs encode [[longitude]] first, and then [[latitude]].
* The first pair (a ''field'') encodes with base 18 and the letters "A" to "R".
* The second pair (''square'') encodes with base 10 and the digits "0" to "9".
* The third pair (''subsquare'') encodes with base 24 and the letters "a" to "x".
* The fourth pair (''extended square'') encodes with base 10 and the digits "0" to "9".
* The fifth and subsequent pairs are not formally defined, but recycling the third and fourth pair algorithms is one possible definition:
** BL11bh16oo66

On [[shortwave]] frequencies, positions are reported at ''square'' precision, and on VHF and UHF, ''subsquare'' precision is used.  More precise position reports are very rarely used.

==Adoption and use==
Like the QRA system before it, Maidenhead locators were enthusiastically adopted by radio amateurs beyond contesting, and it is now in widespread use.

Maidenhead locators are still used as part of the formulas for scoring in many [[VHF]] amateur radio contests and as the basis of earning awards like the American Radio Relay League's [[VHF/UHF Century Club]], URE TTLOC, etc. operating award.

In IARU Region 1 rules, VHF distance calculations are carried out between Maidenhead subsquare centres assuming a ''spherical'' Earth.  This results in a small error in distance, but makes calculations simpler and, given the inherent imprecision in the used input data, it is not the biggest error source.

The relatively new [[WSJT_(amateur_radio_software)#FT8|FT8]] narrowband digital mode transmits Maidenhead locator square as part of standard messages, with the 4 character locator square being efficiently represented within 15 bits of the transmitted string.

Until the adoption of [[WGS 84]] as the official [[geodetic datum]] of the Maidenhead locator system in 1999,&lt;ref name=QRZ.RU-Locator_System/&gt; operators had usually specified their location based on their local national datum. Consequently, stations very near the edges of squares (at denoted precision) may have changed their locators when changing over to the use of WGS 84.

==Hardware and software support==
In 1985, the Radio Society of Great Britain published a small set of [[BASIC]] language routines to convert from locator references to geographical coordinates (latitude and longitude) for further processing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

|location=Potters Bar, UK
|pages=129–161
}}&lt;/ref&gt; A complete program in BASIC called ''Universal Gridlocator'' was made available the following year by ARRL for a nominal cost of US$3.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

|location=Newington, CT
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many other utilities exist to convert latitude and longitude to locators, as this is a favourite [[Hack (technology slang)|hack]] for programmers who are also radio amateurs. [[Perl]] supports conversion between geographical coordinates and Maidenhead locators in module Ham::Locator by Andy Smith, available on [[CPAN]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://search.cpan.org/~meh/Ham-Locator-0.1000/lib/Ham/Locator.pm Ham::Locator] CPAN module&lt;/ref&gt;

Many commercially available general purpose (civil) [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) receivers (e.g. Garmin GPS-12) have the option to display positions in Maidenhead Locator format.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

== Biography ==

Manuel María Paz Delgado was born June 6, 1820 in the town of [[Almaguer, Cauca]], [[Colombia]]. His parents were  Domingo de Paz and Baltazara Delgado, and his siblings were José Miguel de Paz and Carmen de Paz.&lt;ref name="Obra"/&gt; After studying literature in his native Amaguer and still being quite young, he moved to [[Popayán]] to serve as a soldier in the Guardia Nacional, joining Dec. 29, 1839.&lt;ref name="Obra"/&gt;

As a private he participated in several of the civil wars of the [[Republic of New Granada]], and distinguished himself for his bravery.&lt;ref name="Recuento"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Obra"/&gt; As the years passed, he rose through the military ranks, obtaining the rank of [[Colonel]] in 1848.&lt;ref name="Recuento"/&gt; At the same time, along with his military career, he was also developing a career as a painter and cartographer, participating in an 1848 artistic exhibition with the "Mesa Revuelta",&lt;ref name="Obra"/&gt; a work highly admired by the exhibition's selection jury.

[[File:Manuel María Paz (watercolor 9098, 1855 CE).jpg|thumb|Watercolor of the [[Lagunas de Siecha]], in [[Chingaza Natural National Park]], painted by Manuel María Paz in 1855 during the Comisión Corográfica.]]

In 1852 he was married to Felisa Castro. Six children resulted from this union, José Domingo, Felisa, Francisco, María, Ana María y Julián.&lt;ref name="Obra"/&gt; In 1853 he joined the [[Comisión Corográfica]] to work as an artist with [[Henry Price (painter)|Henry Price]], who later retired from the project for reasons of health.&lt;ref name="Recuento"/&gt;

Between 1853 and 1858 he painted 127 lithogaphed watercolors,&lt;ref name="Recuento"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;52 lithogaphed watercolors in 1853 during the fourth corográfic expedition, 16 in 1855 during the sixth expedition, 11 in 1856 during the seventh expedition, 16 in 1857 during the eighth expedition, and more than 32 illustrations of the [[San Agustín culture]], executed by [[Agustín Codazzi]].&lt;/ref&gt; which not only served to illustrate the work of the Comisión, but also included other works published separately under the auspices of [[Agustín Codazzi]]. During these years, María Paz also assisted the celebrated geographer in creating maps of the different regions of the country.

Codazzi died in 1859, in the arms of his friend Manuel María Paz.&lt;ref name="Obra"/&gt; As a result, the work of the Comisión came to a complete stop. [[Tomás Cipriano de Mosquera]] did not want the work to be lost, so he contracted with María Paz and Manuel Ponce de León to finish the works begun under the direction of General Codazzi, and to publish them.&lt;ref name="Obra"/&gt; As a result of this effort, the ''Atlas de los Estados Unidos de Colombia'' appeared in 1865, followed by the ''Atlas Geográfico e Histórico de la República de Colombia'' in 1889. The French [[Société de géographie]] conferred membership on Paz on Dec. 6, 1889 based on the second of the two publications.&lt;ref name="Obra"/&gt;

In the period between the publication of the two works, he also participated in various artistic expositions, such as an 1871 exhibition commemorating celebrating the ''fiestas patrias'' (patriotic national holidays), and in 1883, as a part of the celebrations commemorating the birth of Simón Bolívar the liberator.&lt;ref name="Recuento"/&gt;

After an exhausting but productive life, Manual María Paz Delgado died on Sept. 16, 1902, in the parish of [[San Victorino]] in [[Bogotá]].&lt;ref name="Recuento"/&gt;

A '''place of worship''' is a specially designed structure or consecrated space where individuals or a group of people such as a [[wikt:congregation|congregation]] come to perform acts of devotion, veneration, or religious study. A building constructed or used for this purpose is sometimes called a '''house of worship'''. [[Temple]]s, [[church building|churches]], [[synagogue]]s and [[mosque]]s are examples of structures created for worship. A [[monastery]], particularly for [[Buddhists]], may serve both to house those belonging to religious orders and as a place of worship for visitors. Natural or topographical features may also serve as places of worship, and are considered holy or sacrosanct in some religions; the rituals associated with the [[Ganges]] river are an example in [[Hinduism]].

Under [[International Humanitarian Law]] and the [[Geneva Conventions]], religious buildings are offered special protection, similar to the protection guaranteed hospitals displaying the [[International Red Cross and Red Crescent Movement|Red Cross or Red Crescent]]. These international laws of war bar firing upon or from a religious building.

[[Religious architecture]] expresses the religious beliefs, aesthetic choices, and economic and technological capacity of those who create or adapt it, and thus places of worship show great variety depending on time and place.

The word ''[[wikt:church|church]]'' derives from the Greek ''ekklesia'', meaning ''the called-out ones''.

Other [[Christian denomination]]s, including the [[Religious Society of Friends]], [[Mennonites]], [[Christadelphians]], and some [[unitarianism|unitarians]], object to the use of the word "church" to refer to a building, as they argue that this word should be reserved for the body of believers who worship there.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gee|first=Matthew|date=8 May 2009|title=Meeting for Church Affairs|journal=The Friend|location=London, UK|volume=167|issue=19|page=8|issn=0016-1268|url=http://www.thefriend.org/articledisplay.asp?articleid=3897}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Instead, these groups use words such as "Hall" to identify their places of worship or any building in use by them for the purpose of assembly.

A  '''Hindu temple''' is a symbolic house, seat and body of god. It is a structure designed to bring human beings and gods together, using symbolism to express the ideas and beliefs of [[Hinduism]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Stella Kramrisch|title=The Hindu Temple|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=NNcXrBlI9S0C|year=1946|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass |isbn=978-81-208-0223-0|pages=135, context: 40–43, 110–114, 129–139 with footnotes}}, Quote: "The [Hindu] temple is the seat and dwelling of God, according to the majority of the [Indian] names" (p. 135); "The temple as Vimana, proportionately measured throughout, is the house and body of God" (p. 133).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Michell1977p61"&gt;{{cite book|author=George Michell|title=The Hindu Temple: An Introduction to Its Meaning and Forms|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ajgImLs62gwC&amp;pg=PA61|year=1977|publisher=University of Chicago Press|isbn=978-0-226-53230-1|pages=61–62}}; Quote: "The Hindu temple is designed to bring about contact between man and the gods" (...)

==Islam==
A [[Mosque]] (/mɒsk/; from {{lang-ar| المسجد Al-masjid}}) is a place of worship for followers of [[Islam]].
There are strict and detailed requirements in Sunni jurisprudence (fiqh) for a place of worship to be considered a masjid, with places that do not meet these requirements regarded as musallas. There are stringent restrictions on the uses of the area formally demarcated as the mosque (which is often a small portion of the larger complex), and, in the Islamic Sharia law, after an area is formally designated as a mosque, it remains so until the Last Day.

Many mosques have elaborate domes, minarets, and prayer halls, in varying styles of architecture. Mosques originated on the Arabian Peninsula, but are now found in all inhabited continents. The mosque serves as a place where Muslims can come together for salat (صلاة ṣalāt, meaning "prayer") as well as a center for information, education, social welfare, and dispute settlement. The imam leads the congregation in prayer.

*Before entering the temple, one should bathe and wear fresh washed clothes
*One should not be chewing any edibles
* One should try to keep as silent as possible inside temple.
* Mobile phones should not be used in the temple.

**Some synagogues, especially Reform synagogues, are called temples, but Orthodox and Conservative Judaism consider this inappropriate as they do not consider synagogues a replacement for the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].

 __TOC__

==Background==

The first passive sampling devices were developed in the 1970s to determine concentrations of contaminants in the air. In 1980 this technology was first adapted for the monitoring of organic contaminants in water.&lt;ref name="Alvarez 2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Alvarez|first=D.|title=Development of Semipermeable Membrane Devices (SPMDs) and Polar Organic Integrative Samplers (POCIS) for Environmental Monitoring|journal=Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry|year=2013|volume=23|pages=2179–2181|doi=10.1002/etc.2339}}&lt;/ref&gt; The initial type of passive sampler developed for aquatic monitoring purposes was the semipermeable membrane device (SMPD).&lt;ref name="Alvarez 2013" /&gt; SPMD samplers are most effective at absorbing hydrophobic pollutants with a [[partition coefficient|log octanol-water partitioning coefficient]] (Kow) ranging from 4-8.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2007"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Alvarez, D. A. |author2=Huckins,J. N. |author3=Petty, J.D. |author4=Jones-Lepp, T. |author5=Stuer-Lauridsen, F. |author6=Getting, D.T. |author7=Goddard, J.P. |author8=Gravel A. |title=Comprehensive Analytical Chemistry: Passive Sampling Techniques in Environmental Monitoring|year=2007|publisher=Elsevier|location=Netherlands|isbn=978-0-444-52225-2|pages=171–197}}&lt;/ref&gt; As the global emission of bioconcentratable [[persistent organic pollutants]] (POPs) was shown to result in adverse ecological effects, industry developed a wide range of increasing water-soluble, polar [[hydrophilic]] organic compounds (HpOCs) to replace them. These compounds generally have lower [[bioconcentration factor]]s. However, there is evidence that large fluxes of these HpOCs into aquatic environments may be responsible for a number of adverse effects to aquatic organisms, such as altered behavior, [[neurotoxicity]], [[endocrine disruption]], and impaired reproduction.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2007" /&gt; In the late 1990s research was underway to develop a new passive sampler in order to monitor HpOCs with a log Kow value of less than 3.&lt;ref name="Alvarez 2013" /&gt;  In 1999 the POCIS sampler was under development at the University of Missouri-Columbia. It gathered more support in the early 2000s as concern increased regarding the effects of [[environmental impact of pharmaceuticals and personal care products|pharmaceutical and personal care products]] in surface waters.&lt;ref name="Alvarez 2013" /&gt;
 
The [[United States Geological Survey]] (USGS) has been heavily involved in the development of passive samplers and has articles in their database regarding the development of POCIS as early as 2000. The USGS Columbia Environmental Research Center (CERC) is a self-proclaimed international leader in the field of passive sampling.&lt;ref name="USGS 2004"&gt;{{cite web|title=Passive Sampling|url=http://www.cerc.usgs.gov/Branches.aspx?BranchId=8|publisher=United States Geological Society (USGS) Columbia Environmental Research Center|accessdate=24 May 2014|date=May 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; There have been recent efforts by the USGS to connect people who have an interest in passive sampling. An international workshop and symposium on passive sampling was held by the USGS in 2013 to connect developers, policy makers and end users in order to discuss ways of monitoring environmental pollution.&lt;ref&gt;http://ipsw.eu/2013/ International Passive Sampling Workshop and Symposium (IPSW)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fundamentals==

The POCIS device was developed and patented by Jimmie D. Petty, James N. Huckins, and David A. Alvarez, of the Columbia Environmental Research Center.&lt;ref name="USGS 2004"/&gt; Integrative passive samplers are an effective way to monitor the concentration of organic contaminants in aquatic systems over time. Most aquatic monitoring programs rely on collecting individual samples, often called [[environmental monitoring#grab samples|grab samples]], at a specific time.&lt;ref name="Chimuka"&gt;Chimuka L, Cukrowska E. 2008. Monitoring of Aquatic Environments Using Passive Samplers. ''Open Analytical Chemistry Journal'' 2:1-9.&lt;/ref&gt; The grab sampling method is associated with many disadvantages that can be resolved by passive sampling techniques. When contaminants are present in trace amounts, grab sampling may require the collection of large volumes of water. Also, lab analysis of the sample can only provide a snapshot of contaminant levels at the time of collection. This approach therefore has drawbacks when monitoring in environments where water contamination varies over time and episodic contamination events occur.&lt;ref name="Alvarez 2013" /&gt; Passive sampling techniques have been able to provide a time-integrated sample of water contamination with low detection limits and in situ extraction of [[analyte]]s.&lt;ref name="Harman"&gt;Harman C, Allan IJ, Vermeirssen ELM. 2012. Calibration and Use of the Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler- A Critical Review. ''Environmental Toxicology and Chemistry'' 14:2724-2738.&lt;/ref&gt;

===POCIS set-up===

The POCIS sampler consists of an array of sampling disks mounted on a support rod. Each disk consists of a solid [[sorbent]] sandwiched between two polyethersoulfone (PES) [[microporous material|microporous]] membranes which are then compressed between two stainless steel rings which expose a sampling area.&lt;ref name="Harman" /&gt; A standard POCIS disk consists of a sampling surface area to sorbent mass ratio of approximately 180&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;g. Because the amount of chemical sampled is directly related to the sample surface area, it is sometimes necessary to combine extracts from multiple POCIS disks into one sample. Stainless steel rings, or other rigid inert material, are essential to prevent sorbent loss as the PES membranes are not able to be heat sealed.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2007" /&gt; The POCIS array is then inserted and deployed within a protective canister. This canister is usually made of stainless steel or [[polyvinyl chloride|PVC]] and works to deflect debris that may displace the POCIS array during its deployment.&lt;ref name="ITRC 2006" /&gt;

The PES membrane acts as a [[semipermeable membrane|semipermeable]] barrier between the sorbent and surrounding aquatic environment. It allows dissolved contaminants to pass through the sorbent while selectively excluding any particles larger than 100&amp;nbsp;nm.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2007" /&gt; The membrane resists [[biofouling]] because the polyethersulphone used in the design is less prone than other materials.&lt;ref name="ITRC 2006" /&gt; The POCIS is versatile in that the sorbents can be changed to target different classes of contaminants. However, only two sorbent classes are considered as standards of all POCIS deployments to date.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2004" /&gt;

===Theory and modeling===

Each POCIS disk will sample a certain volume of water per day. The volume of water sampled varies from chemical to chemical and is dependent on the [[physical property|physical]] and [[chemical property|chemical]] properties of the compound as well as the duration of sampling. The sampling rate of POCIS can vary with changes in the water flow, turbulence, temperature, and the buildup of solids on the sampler’s surface.&lt;ref name="ITRC 2006" /&gt; The accumulation of contaminants into a POCIS device is the result of three successive process occurring at the same time. First, the contaminants have to diffuse across the water [[boundary layer]]. The thickness of this layer is dependent on water flow and turbulence around the sampler and can significantly alter sampling rates. Second, the contaminant must transport across the membrane either through the water-filled pores or through the membrane itself. Finally, contaminants transfer from the membrane into the sorbent material mainly through [[adsorption]]. These last two steps make the modeling, understanding, and prediction of accumulation by a POCIS device challenging. To date, a limited number of chemical sampling rates have been determined.&lt;ref name="Harman" /&gt;

Accumulation of chemicals by a POCIS device generally follows first order kinetics. The kinetics are characterized by an initial integrative phase, followed by an [[partition equilibrium|equilibrium partitioning]] phase. During the integrative phase of uptake, a passive sampling device accumulates residues linearly relative to time, assuming constant exposure concentrations. Based on current results, the POCIS sampler remains in a linear phase for at least 30 days, and has been observed up to 56 days. Therefore, both laboratory and field data justify the use of a linear uptake model for the calculation of sample rates.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2007" /&gt; In order to estimate the ambient water concentration of contaminants sampled by a POCIS device, there must be available [[calibration]] data applicable for in situ conditions regarding the target compound. Currently, this information is limited.&lt;ref name="ITRC 2006" /&gt;

==Applicability==

POCIS can be deployed in a wide range of aquatic environments including stagnant pools, rivers, springs, [[estuary|estuarine]] systems, and [[wastewater]] streams.&lt;ref name="USGS 2004"&gt;http://www.cerc.usgs.gov/pubs/center/pdfdocs/pocis.pdf. United States Geological Society (USGS) Columbia Environmental Research Center. Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS)&lt;/ref&gt; However, there has been little research into the use of POCIS in strictly marine environments.&lt;ref name="Harman" /&gt; Prior to deployment of a POCIS device, it is essential to select a study site that will maximize the effectiveness of the sampler. Selecting an area that is shaded will help prevent light sensitive chemicals from being degrading. The site should also allow the sampler to be submerged in the water without being buried in the sediment.&lt;ref name="USGS 2004" /&gt; It is ideal to place the sampler in moving water in order to increase sampling rates, however, areas with an extremely turbulent water flow should be avoided as to prevent damage to the POCIS device. Passive samplers are very vulnerable to vandalism and it is therefore important to secure the sampler in areas that are not easily visible and that are away from areas frequently used by people.&lt;ref name="USGS 2004" /&gt;
 
POCIS samplers can be deployed for a period of time ranging from weeks to months. The shortest deployment lengths are typically 7 days but average 2–3 months.&lt;ref name="Harman" /&gt; It is important to have a long enough deployment period to allow for adequate detection of contaminants at ambient environmental concentrations. Often, the two different types of POCIS devices will be deployed together in order to provide the greatest understanding of contamination.&lt;ref name="Harman" /&gt; It is also important to deploy enough POCIS devices to ensure a large enough sample of contaminant is recovered for chemical analysis. An estimate or the number of samplers needed at a given site can be determined by the following equation.&lt;ref name="Alvarez 2010"&gt;Alvarez DA. 2010. Guidelines for the Use of the Semipermeable Membrane Device (SPMD) and the Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS) in Environmental Monitoring Studies.''Section D, Water Quality Book 1, Collection of Water Data by Direct Measurement.''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relevant contaminants===

Any compound with a log Kow of less than or equal to 3 can concentrate in a POCIS sampler.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2007" /&gt; Applicable classes of contaminants measured by POCIS are pharmaceuticals, household and industrial products, hormones, herbicides, and polar pesticides (Table 1). Currently, there are two POCIS configurations that are targeted for different classes of contaminants. A general POCIS design contains a sorbent that is used to collect pesticides, natural as well as synthetic hormones, and wastewater related chemicals. The pharmaceutical POCIS configuration contains a sorbent that is designed to specifically target classes of pharmaceuticals.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.nemi.gov/methods/method_summary/10622/ National Environmental Methods Index (NEMI). USGS: POCIS:  Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS).&lt;/ref&gt;

===POCIS processing===

Before the POCIS is constructed, all the hardware as well as the sorbents and membrane must be thoroughly cleaned so that any potential interference is removed. During and after sampling the only cleaning necessary is the removal of any sediment that has adhered to the surface of the sampler. After assembly, and prior to deployment, the samplers are stored in frozen airtight containers to avoid any contamination. The samplers should be kept in airtight containers during transportation both to and from the sampling site so that airborne contaminants do not contaminate the sampler. It is ideal to keep the samplers cold while transporting them in order to preserve the integrity of the samples.&lt;ref name="ITRC 2006" /&gt;

After the POCIS is retrieved from the field, the membrane is gently cleaned to reduce the possibility of any contamination to the sorbent.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2007" /&gt; The sorbent is placed into a [[chromatography]] column so that the chemicals that samples can be recovered using an organic solvent. The solvent used is specifically chosen based on the type of sorbent and chemicals sampled. The sample can go through further processing such as cleanup or [[fractionation]] depending on the desired use of the sample.&lt;ref name="ITRC 2006" /&gt;

===Data analysis===

After the sample has been processed, the extract can be analysed using a variety of data analysis techniques.&lt;ref name="Harman" /&gt; The chemical analysis and analytical instrumentation used depends on the goal of the study. Many analyses require multiple samples, although in some cases a single POCIS sample can be used for multiple analyses.&lt;ref name="Alvarez 2010" /&gt;
  
It is vital to use [[quality control]] (QC) procedures when using passive samplers.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2007" /&gt; It is common practice for 10% to 50% of the total number of samples to be used for QC purposes. The number of QC samples depends on the study objectives.&lt;ref name="Alvarez 2010" /&gt; The QC samples are used to address issues such as sample contamination and analyte recovery.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2007" /&gt; The types of QC samples commonly used include; reagent blanks, field blanks, matrix spikes, and procedural spikes.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2007" /&gt;

A large number of studies have been performed in which POCIS data was combined with  [[bioassay]]s to measure biological endpoints. Testing POCIS extracts in biological assays is useful as a POCIS device samples over its entire deployment period, and biologically active compounds can be effectively monitored. It can also be argued that the use of POCIS is a more relevant from an [[ecotoxicology|ecotoxicological]] perspective as the use of a passive sampler mimics the uptake of compounds by organisms. Another strength in using bioassays to test environmental samples is that they can provide an integrative measure of the toxic potential of a group of chemical compounds, rather than a single contaminant.&lt;ref name="Harman" /&gt;

==Other passive samplers==

There are many types of passive samplers used that specialize in absorbing different classes of aquatic contaminants found in the environment.&lt;ref name="ITRC 2006" /&gt; [[Chemcatcher]] and SMPD are two types of passive samplers that are also commonly used.&lt;ref name="Alvarez 2013" /&gt; Monitoring programs use SMPDs to measure to hydrophobic organic contaminants. SPMDs are designed to mimic the [[bioconcentration]] of contaminants in fatty tissues (ITRC, 2006). Contaminants applicable to the use of an SPMD include, but are not limited to, [[polychlorinated biphenyls]] (PCBs), [[polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs), [[organochloride|organochlorine]] pesticides, [[Dioxins and dioxin-like compounds|dioxins]], and [[furans]].&lt;ref name="ITRC 2006" /&gt;
 
The SPMD consist of a thin-walled, [[nonporous]], [[polyethylene]] membrane tube that is filled with high molecular weight [[lipid]].&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2004" /&gt; These tubes are approximately 90&amp;nbsp;cm long and wrap around the inside of a stainless steel deployment canister.&lt;ref name="USGS 2004"&gt;http://www.cerc.usgs.gov/pubs/center/pdfdocs/pocis.pdf. United States Geological Society (USGS) Columbia Environmental Research Center. Polar Organic Chemical Integrative Sampler (POCIS)&lt;/ref&gt; SMPDs are efficient at absorbing pollutants with a log Kow of 4-8. This slightly overlaps with the range of contaminants absorbed by POCIS. Because of this, SMPDs and POCIS devices are often used together in monitoring studies to achieve a more representative understanding of contamination.&lt;ref name="Alvarez et al. 2004" /&gt;

==Future development==

The POCIS system is continually evaluated for the potential to sample a wide range of contaminants. Calibration data and analyte recovery methods are currently being generated by researchers around the world. Techniques to merge the POCIS device with bioassays are also under development.&lt;ref name="ITRC 2006" /&gt; The POCIS sampler already serves as a versatile, economical, and robust tool for monitoring studies and observing trends in both space and time. However, sampling rates are not yet robust enough to supply reliable contaminant concentrations, particularly when regarding environmental quality standards.&lt;ref name="Harman" /&gt;  A limited number of sampling rates have been determined for chemicals and the determination of additional sampling rate data is necessary for the advancement of passive sampling technology.&lt;ref name="ITRC 2006" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7661">'''Q-guidance''' is a method of missile [[guidance system|guidance]] used in some U.S. [[ballistic missiles]] and some civilian space flights. It was developed in the 1950s by [[J. Halcombe Laning]] and Richard Battin at the [[Charles Stark Draper Laboratory|MIT Instrumentation Lab]].

Q-guidance is used for missiles whose trajectory consists of a relatively short [[boost phase]] (or powered phase) during which the missile's propulsion system operates, followed by a [[coast phase|ballistic phase]] during which the missile coasts to its target under the influence of gravity. ([[Cruise missile]]s use different guidance methods).  The objective of Q-guidance is to hit a specified target at a specified time (if there is some flexibility as to the time the target should be hit then other types of guidance can be used).

==Early Implementations==

At the time Q-guidance was developed the main competitive method was called Delta-guidance. According to Mackenzie,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;Mackenzie: Inventing Accuracy&lt;/ref&gt; [[Titan missile|Titan]], some versions of [[Atlas missile|Atlas]], [[LGM-30 Minuteman|Minuteman]] I and II used Delta-guidance, while Q-guidance was used for [[Thor missile|Thor IRBM]] and [[Polaris missile|Polaris]], and presumably [[Poseidon missile|Poseidon]]. It appears, from monitoring of test launches, that early Soviet ICBMs used a variant of Delta-guidance.

==Delta-guidance overview==

Delta-guidance is based on adherence to a planned reference trajectory, which is developed before the flight using ground-based computers and stored in the missile's guidance system. In flight, the actual trajectory is modeled mathematically as a [[Taylor series]] expansion around the reference trajectory. The guidance system attempts to zero the linear terms of this expression, i.e. to bring the missile back to the planned trajectory.  For this reason, Delta-guidance is sometimes referred to as "fly [along] the wire", where the (imaginary) wire refers to the reference trajectory.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

In contrast, Q-guidance is a dynamic method, reminiscent of the theories [[dynamic programming]] or [[State space (controls)|state based feedback]].  In essence, it says "never mind where we were supposed to be, given where we are what should we do to make progress towards the goal of reaching the required target at the required time".  To do this it relies on the concept of "velocity to be gained".

==Velocity To Be Gained==
At a given time ''t'' and for a given vehicle position ''r'', the correlated velocity vector ''V''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is defined as follows: if the vehicle had the velocity ''V''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and the propulsion system was turned off, then the missile would reach the desired target at the desired time under the influence of gravity.  In some sense, ''V''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; is the desired velocity.

The actual velocity of the missile is denoted by ''V''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; and the missile is subject to both the acceleration due to gravity ''g'' and that due to the engines ''a''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt;.  The velocity to be gained is defined as the difference between ''V''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt; and ''V''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt;:

: &lt;math&gt;V_{TBG} = V_c - V_m&lt;/math&gt;

A simple guidance strategy is to apply acceleration (i.e. engine thrust) in the direction of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;TBG&lt;/sub&gt;.  This will have the effect of making the actual velocity come closer to ''V''&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;.  When they become equal (i.e. when ''V''&lt;sub&gt;TBG&lt;/sub&gt; becomes identically zero) it is time to shut off the engines, since the missile is by definition able to reach the desired target at the desired time on its own.

The only remaining issue is how to compute ''V''&lt;sub&gt;TBG&lt;/sub&gt; easily from information available on board the vehicle.

==The Q Matrix==

A remarkably simple differential equation can be used to compute the velocity to be gained:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dV_{TBG}}{dt} = -a_T - Q V_{TBG}&lt;/math&gt;

where the ''Q'' matrix is defined by

:&lt;math&gt;Q = \left. \frac{\partial V_c}{\partial r}\right|_{r_T,t_f}&lt;/math&gt;

where ''Q'' is a symmetric 3 by 3 time-varying matrix.  (The vertical bar refers to the fact that the derivative must be evaluated for a given target position ''r''&lt;sub&gt;T&lt;/sub&gt; and time of free flight ''t''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt;.)&lt;ref&gt;Battin: Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; The calculation of this matrix is non-trivial, but can be performed offline before the flight; experience shows that the matrix is only slowly time varying, so only a few values of Q corresponding to different times during the flight need to be stored on board the vehicle.

In early applications the integration of the differential equation was performed using analog hardware, rather than a digital computer. Information about vehicle acceleration, velocity and position is supplied by the onboard [[Inertial measurement unit]].

'''Derivation of the equation'''

Notation:

''t'' the current time

''r'' the current vehicle position vector

''V''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; the current vehicle velocity vector

''T'' the time the vehicle will reach the target

''t''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; the time of free flight for the correlated vehicle, i.e. t-T

[...]

==Cross Product Steering==

A reasonable strategy to gradually align the thrust vector to the ''V''&lt;sub&gt;TBG&lt;/sub&gt; vector is to steer at a rate proportional to the cross product between them.  A simple control strategy that does this is to steer at the rate

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \kappa (a_T \times V_{TBG})&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\kappa&lt;/math&gt; is a constant. This implicitly assumes that ''V''&lt;sub&gt;TBG&lt;/sub&gt; remains roughly constant during the maneuver.  A somewhat more clever strategy can be designed that takes into account the rate of time change of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;TBG&lt;/sub&gt; as well, since this is available from the differential equation above.

This second control strategy is based on Battin's insight&lt;ref&gt;Battin: An Introduction&lt;/ref&gt; that "If you want to drive a vector to zero, it is [expedient] to align the time rate of change of the vector with the vector itself". This suggests setting the auto-pilot steering rate to

:&lt;math&gt;\omega = \kappa (V_{TBG} \times \frac{d V_{TBG}}{dt})&lt;/math&gt;

Either of these methods are referred to as '''cross-product steering''', and they are easy to implement in analog hardware.

Finally, when all components of ''V''&lt;sub&gt;TBG&lt;/sub&gt; are small, the order to cut-off engine power can be given.

'''Salt surface structures''' are extensions of [[salt tectonics]] that form at the Earth's surface when either [[diapir]]s or salt sheets pierce through the overlying [[strata]]. They can occur in any location where there are salt deposits, namely in cratonic basins, [[Rift|synrift]] basins, [[passive margin]]s and [[Convergent boundary|collisional margins]]. These are environments where mass quantities of water collect and then evaporate; leaving behind salt and other [[evaporite]]s to form sedimentary beds.&lt;ref name=hudec2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hudec|first1=Michael R.|last2=Jackson|first2=Martin P.A.|title=Terra infirma: Understanding salt tectonics|journal= Earth-Science Reviews|year=2007|volume=82|issue=1|pages=1–28|bibcode=2007ESRv...82....1H|doi=10.1016/j.earscirev.2007.01.001}}&lt;/ref&gt; When there is a difference in pressure, such as additional sediment in a particular area, the salt beds – due to the unique ability of salt to behave as a fluid under pressure – form into new structures. Sometimes, these new bodies form subhorizontal or moderately [[Strike and dip|dipping]] structures over a younger stratigraphic unit, which are called allochthonous salt bodies or  salt surface structures.&lt;ref name=hudec2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=hudec1&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hudec|first1=Michael R.|last2=Jackson|first2=Martin P.A.|title=Advance of allochthonous salt sheets in passive margins and orogens|journal=AAPG Bulletin|year=2006|volume=90|issue=10|doi=10.1306/05080605143}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Deposition environments.jpg|Image of example environments for salt deposition. Areas of likely deposition are shown in lavender.|thumb|right]]

=== Tectonic environments ===
Four key environments can facilitate salt deposition.  These places allow salt-bearing water to collect and evaporate, leaving behind bedded deposits of solidified salt crystals.  Below are short descriptions of these environments and a few examples.
# Convergent boundaries – Areas where two [[plate tectonics|plates]] collide; if there is water trapped between the two, there is the possibility of evaporation and deposition.  The [[Mediterranean Sea]],&lt;ref name=Huguen&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Huguen|first1=C|last2= Chamot-Rooke|first2=N.|last3=Loubrieu|first3=B.|last4=Mascle|first4=J.|title=Morphology of a pre-collisional, salt bearing, accretionary complex: The Mediterranean Ridge (Eastern Mediterranean)|journal=Marine Geophysical Research|date=March 2006|volume=27|issue=1|page=61|doi=10.1007/s11001-005-5026-5|bibcode=2006MarGR..27...61H}}&lt;/ref&gt; particularly during the [[Messinian salinity crisis]], is a prime example.
# Rifted boundaries/passive margins – Also known as divergent boundaries, these areas begin as [[rift]] basins, where extension is pulling apart the crust.  If this rifting allows water to flood the resulting valley, salt deposition can occur.  Examples include the [[Campos Basin]], Brazil, [[Kwanza Basin]], West Africa,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Rouby|first1=D|last2=Raillard|first2=Stéphane|last3=Guillocheau|first3=François|last4=Bouroullec|first4=Renaud|last5=Nalpas|first5=Thierry|title=Kinematics of a growth fault/raft system on the West African margin using 3-D restoration|journal=Journal of Structural Geology|year=2002|volume=24|issue=4|page=783|doi=10.1016/S0191-8141(01)00108-0|bibcode=2002JSG....24..783R}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Gulf of Mexico]].&lt;ref name=Prather&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Prather|first1=BE|title=Calibration and visualization of depositional process models for above grade slopes: a case study from the Gulf of Mexico|journal=[[Marine and Petroleum Geology]]|date=May 2000|volume=17|issue=5|page=619|doi=10.1016/S0264-8172(00)00015-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Cratonic basins – Within continental boundaries, salt deposition can occur anywhere that bodies of water can collect.  Even away from ocean sources, water is capable of dissolving and carrying ions that can later precipitate as salts, and when the water evaporates, the salts are left behind.  Examples of these basins are the [[South Oman Salt Basin]]&lt;ref name=Amthor&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Amthor|first1=JE|last2= |title=Stratigraphy and sedimentology of a chert reservoir at the Precambrian-Cambrian Boundary: the Al Shomou Siliclyte, South Oman Salt Basin|journal=GeoArabia|year=2005|volume=10|issue=2|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Michigan Basin]].  In the past, there was a great shallow sea covering most of the [[Great Plains]] region of the United States; when this sea dried up, it created the [[Strataca]] deposit now mined in [[Kansas]], among others.

=== Characteristics ===
Salt has two key characteristics that make it unique in a tectonic setting, and important economically. The first is that salt (and other evaporites) deform plastically over geologic time, and thus behaves as a fluid rather than a rigid structure.&lt;ref name=Weijermars&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Weijermars|first1=D.M.|last2=Jackson|first2=M.P.A.|last3=Venderville|first3=B.|title=Rheological and tectonic modeling of salt provinces|journal=Tectonophysics|volume=217|year=1993|issue=217|page=143|bibcode=1993Tectp.217..143W|doi=10.1016/0040-1951(93)90208-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows structures with salt components to deform more easily and have a slightly different appearance. Take, for example the [[Geology of the Appalachians|Appalachians]], which contain some salt deposits, and the [[Geology of the Rocky Mountains|Rocky Mountains]], which is an [[Accretion (geology)|accretionary]] terrain with little to no salt. This also allows for the creation of structural traps for oil and gas, as well as metals &lt;ref name=Warren&gt;{{cite book|last1=Warren|first1=J.|title=Evaporites: Their Evolution and Economics|year=1999|publisher=Oxford|pages=438|isbn= 978-3-540-26011-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which makes them sought after targets in industry.
The second, which is the fact that evaporites are often less dense, or more [[Buoyancy|buoyant]], than the surrounding rock, which aids in its mobility and creates a [[Rayleigh-Taylor instability|Rayleigh Taylor instability]]. This means that the less dense substance will find a way to rise through or away from the more dense one. In salt tectonics, this occurs in three ways; the first is differential loading, where the salt flows from an area of high pressure to lower pressure, the second is gravitational spreading, where the salt spreads out laterally under its own gravitational weight, the last is thermal convection, where warmer – and thus less dense – salt rises through colder and more dense salt.&lt;ref name=Jackson&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Jackson|first1=M.P.A.|last2=Talbot|first2=C.J.|title=External shapes, strain rates an dynamics of salt structures|journal=Geological Society of America Bulletin|volume=97|issue=3|page=305|bibcode=1986GSAB...97..305J|doi=10.1130/0016-7606(1986)97&lt;305:ESSRAD&gt;2.0.CO;2|year=1986}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is only seen in laboratory settings due to the unlikely occurrence of salt bodies with great enough temperature variance.

== Evolution histories ==
[[File:Peircemnt 2.jpg|Peircemnt 2|Illustration of the six piercement types; black arrows show the forces acting on the salt layer, white arrows show the reaction of the salt to these forces.|thumb|right]]
In order for originally horizontal beds to form the allochthonous salts, they must first break free of their geological restraints. The first base structure can be formed in a combination of six ways:&lt;ref name=hudec2 /&gt;
# '''Reactive piercement''' – a normal fault synrift relieves pressure above the salt layer. This causes the salt to flow into the area of lower pressure to maintain its equilibrium.&lt;ref name=Vendeville&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Vendeville|first1=BC|last2=Jackson|first2=MPA|title=The rise of diapirs during thin-skinned extension|journal=Marine and Petroleum Geology|date=August 1992|volume=9|issue=4|pages=331–354|doi=10.1016/0264-8172(92)90047-I|url=http://www.beg.utexas.edu/indassoc/agl/pubs/Rise.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# '''Active piercement''' – salt moves through sediments where there are no structures to take advantage of.&lt;ref name=Vendeville /&gt;
# '''Erosional piercement''' – overlying sediments are eroded away, revealing the present [[salt dome]].
# '''Thrust piercement'''  – local thrust faults apply force to salt sheets which follow the path of least resistance up the footwall of the fault.
# '''Ductile piercement''' – not so much a 'piercing' movement, but local differential pressure force the salt to rise through weaker overlying sediments. Occurs due to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability created by salt's low density.
# '''Passive piercement'''  – after the salt column has initially pierced the overlying sediments, the rate it rises matches or supersedes the growing sediment layers.&lt;ref name=Vendeville /&gt;
From here there are three paths that a forming surface structure can take.
Two stem from a diapir base, and the third from a sheet base. The sheet becomes a source-fed thrust, not unlike the thrust piercement, it takes advantage of local fault planes to rise. The difference between the two diapir bases, is that one, termed a plug-fed thrust, has a sediment cap over the top, preventing the salt from freely flowing until building pressure forces it through the cap; the other, a plug-fed extrusion, lacks the sediment cap and is allowed to flow freely.&lt;ref name=hudec1 /&gt;

== Types of surface structures ==
Once the salt structure has reached the surface, it is termed one of four names; salt-wing intrusions, extrusive advance, open-toed advance or thrust advance.&lt;ref name=hudec2 /&gt;&lt;ref name=hudec1 /&gt; There is a certain level of transition between the four, as some process, such as the dissolution and removal of salt, deposition of new sediment, erosion and thrusting can shift the characteristics between them.
[[File:Salt Wing Intrusion.jpg|Salt-wing intrusion|thumb|left]]

=== Salt-wing intrusions ===
Salt-wing intrusions are technically underground structures; found in shortening, or compressional, systems, they form radial salt wedges between detached bedding planes. However, the caps on them can be eroded away, revealing the salt and transforming it into an extrusive advance.&lt;ref name=hudec2 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fossen2010"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fossen|first=Haakon|title=Structural Geology|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=01PI5jhjiiQC&amp;pg=PA388|date=2010-07-15|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=978-1-139-48861-7|page=388}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Extrusive Advance 3d.jpg|Extrusive advance showed in 3D|thumb|right]]

=== Extrusive advance ===
Extrusive advances begin once the diapir reaches the ground’s surface and the salt is exposed. The salt then spreads from the feeder under gravitational pressure alone.&lt;ref name=hudec2 /&gt; This flowing has two consequences that form the structure. First, as the top of the salt flows faster than the bottom, there is a frontal roll along the leading edge. Second, the salt overrides any sediment being deposited at the same time, causing the feature to climb upsection and prograde.  Over time, some of the salt is dissolved away, leaving a layer of impurities and other sediments behind, the thickness of this roof, or sediment cap, depends on the percentage of impurities in the salt and the sedimentation rate of the area.&lt;ref name=hudec2 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fossen2010" /&gt;

[[File:Close toed advnance.jpg|Thrust or close-toed advance in 3D|thumb|left]]

=== Thrust advance ===
Thrust advances return to salt sheets as their primary base structure, and form because salt provides a weak detachment layer for faulting systems. When force is applied in such systems, the buried sheet will advance along the hanging wall. There are three driving processes in this type of advance; gravitational pressure of both the salt and overlying sediments, spreading of the margin and general plate tectonics.&lt;ref name=hudec2 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fossen2010" /&gt;

=== Open-toed advance ===
[[File:Open-toe advance 3d.jpg|Open-toe advance in 3D. Wide arrows show the direction of motion, thin arrows indicate salt motion.|thumb|right]]
Open-toed advances can either evolve from the dissolution of salts from an extrusive advance structure, or it could have evolved from a plug-fed thrust. They are partially buried advances where only the advancing edge, called the toe, is open to flow, which is controlled by a combination of gravitational forces and differential pressure of the overlying sediments. There are three described sediment roof types: [[Syncline|synclinal]] basins – isolated patches of consolidated sediments, prograding roof – a growing sheet of sediments, and salt breakout – where  the salt had to force its way through the overlying sediments.&lt;ref name=hudec2 /&gt;&lt;ref name="Fossen2010" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9075">'''Senior Chinese Unofficial Member''' ({{zh|c=首席華人非官守議員}}) denotes the highest-ranking [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] member of the [[Legislative Council]] and [[Executive Council of Hong Kong|Executive Council]] under [[Colonial Hong Kong|colonial British rule]]. As Chinese council members were frequently referred to as "Chinese Representatives", the senior member was also known as the "Senior Chinese Representative". In the later years of the colonial rule, many Senior Chinese Unofficial Member also served as [[Senior Unofficial Member]] at the same time.

==歷史沿革==
歷史上立法局首位華人非官守議員是[[伍才]]，他於[[1880年]]成為首位獲委到立法局的華人 非官守議員；而 周壽臣|周壽臣爵士則是歷史上行政局首位華人非官守議員，他於[[1926年]]成為第一位獲委到[[行政局]]的華人。

根據統計，香港殖民地歷史中分別有22人及11人擔任過立法局及行政局的首席華人非官守議員。當中，[[周壽臣|周壽臣爵士]]、[[羅旭龢|羅旭龢爵士]]、[[周埈年|周埈年爵士]]、[[周錫年|周錫年爵士]]、[[馮秉芬|馮秉芬爵士]]、[[關祖堯|關祖堯爵士]]、[[簡悅強|簡悅強爵士]]、[[鍾士元|鍾士元爵士]]及[[鄧蓮如|鄧蓮如女男爵]]共九人曾擔任過立法局及行政局首席華人非官守議員兩個職位。

此外，在立法局中，在任最長的首席華人非官守議員是[[何啟|何啟爵士]]，共24年；而最短的是[[曹善允|曹善允博士]]、[[郭贊]]及[[關祖堯|關祖堯爵士]]，三人各自出任此職僅約一年。在眾人當中，周埈年爵士是唯一兩次出任立法局首席華人非官守議員的人士；鄧蓮如女男爵則是唯一一位出任此位的女性。 

至於在行政局方面，在任最長的首席華人非官守議員是周壽臣爵士，共10年；而最短的是馮秉芬爵士，只有約一年。鄧蓮如女男爵是首位出任行政局首席華人非官守議員的女性。就兩局而言，[[劉鑄伯]]及關祖堯爵士兩人都是在任內去世的首席華人非官守議員；而周埈年爵士及周錫年爵士兩人是唯一來自同一家族的首席華人非官守議員。

在[[第二次世界大戰|戰後]]，由於華人人數佔行政、立法兩局總議員人數的比例愈來愈大，因此首席華人非官守議員很多時也是[[首席非官守議員]]，例如自[[1974年]]至[[1997年]]期間，行政局首席非官守議員一職皆由華人出任；而立法局首席非官守議員一職自戰後也大多由華人出任，故此首席華人非官守議員一銜在[[香港1970年代|1970年代]]起漸被淘汰，並索性被稱呼首席非官守議員。 --&gt;

'''Thaddeus Xaverius Peregrinus Haenke''' (5 October 1761 &amp;ndash; 4 November 1816) ({{lang-cs|Tadeáš Haenke}}; {{lang-es|Tadeo Haenke}}) was a [[botanist]] who participated in the [[Malaspina Expedition]], exploring a significant portion of the Pacific basin including the coasts of North and South America, Australia, the Philippines, New Zealand, and the Marianas. His collections of botanical specimens were the basis for the initial scientific descriptions of many plants in these regions, particularly South America and the Philippines. His extensive botanical work and far-ranging travel have prompted some to liken him to a "Czech [[Alexander von Humboldt|Humboldt]]".&lt;ref name="Cutter"&gt;Cutter (1983)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
[[Image:Tadeus Haenke.JPG|thumb|left|Memorial plaque of 1885 at his birthplace, in German, with plaque in Czech added in the 1960s]]

Haenke was born 5 October 1761 in the village of Kreibitz, [[Bohemia]] (now [[Chřibská]], [[Czech Republic]]). His parents were ethnic Germans and his father, Elias George Thomas Haenke, was a successful lawyer and  farmer who also served as mayor. A keen observer of nature from childhood, Haenke pursued this interest throughout his education. He studied natural science and philosophy at the [[Charles University in Prague|University of Prague]] where his mentor was [[Joseph Gottfried Mikan]], the resident professor of botany. He served as an assistant to Mikan, helping care for the school's botanic gardens. Haenke received a doctorate in 1782, continued to study in Prague until 1786 and then became a student at the University of Vienna where he studied medicine and botany under [[Nikolaus Joseph von Jacquin]].&lt;ref name="Cutter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Sterling"&gt;Sterling (1997)&lt;/ref&gt;

While still a student, Haenke made extensive botanical collections from what is now the Czech Republic; wrote a treatise on the botany of the [[Giant Mountains]]; edited an edition of Linnaeus' ''[[Genera Plantarum]]'' (published in 1791); and was awarded a silver medal from the Royal Czech Scientific Society. He was also an accomplished musician, a capable illustrator, and spoke five languages. &lt;ref name="Sterling" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Beidleman"&gt;Beidleman (2006)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Malaspina expedition==
[[File:MalaspinaRouteMap.png|400px|thumb|right|Map showing the route of Malaspina's ship ''Descubierta'' with the return to Spain from Tonga omitted. The route of Bustamante's ''Atrevida'' was mostly the same, but deviated in some places.]]
By 1789 Haenke was a prominent young scholar whose name was put forward by Jacquin and [[Ignaz von Born]] when Spain was recruiting a scientific corps for the [[Malaspina expedition]]. [[Emperor Joseph II]] had met Haenke before and he approved the appointment. Thus Haenke became “Naturalist-Botánico de Su Magestad” for the expedition. A long, roundabout journey from Vienna brought Haenke to [[Cadiz]] on 30 July 1789, just hours after the two ships of the expedition, the ''[[Descubierta and Atrevida]]'', had set sail.&lt;ref name="Sterling" /&gt;

Determined not to miss this opportunity, he took passage on another ship, intending to catch up with the expedition in [[Montevideo]]. This vessel was shipwrecked near his destination and Haenke was forced to swim for the shore, salvaging only his collecting equipment and his copy of ''Genera Plantarum''. Again, he had just missed the expedition. After recuperating in Buenos Aires, he hired guides for a trek overland across the pampas and Andes, hoping to catch the expedition at Valparaiso. Along the way, Haenke managed to collect about 1400 plants, many of them new to science. Although his botanical work must have slowed them down, he managed to reach the coast in time to join Malaspina in April 1790.&lt;ref name="Sterling" /&gt;

From there Haenke continued with the expedition for the next three years, collecting plants and recording his observations on botany, zoology, geology, and ethnology. They initially traveled up the west coast of the Americas as far as Alaska, then returned south to Acapulco and crossed the Pacific to explore the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Sterling" /&gt; At each port of call Haenke focused on botany with varying results. In [[Yakutat Bay]], Alaska the plants he collected were disappointingly similar to those in Europe so he focused instead on Indian culture, especially music. In [[Nootka Sound]] he made the first scientific collection of plants from Canada.&lt;ref name="Cutter" /&gt; Their brief stay in California enabled Haenke to collect and catalog over 250 species, most notably he was the first scientist to collect the seeds and specimens of the [[coast redwood]].&lt;ref name="Beidleman" /&gt; 

After crossing the Pacific, Haenke collected thousands of plants during their seven-month stay in the Philippines. Further collecting took place in Australia, New Zealand, and Tonga. In the summer of 1793 the expedition returned to Peru where Malaspina received orders to return home by way of Montevideo. Haenke was permitted to leave the ship with an assistant and cross overland to Buenos Aires with the intention of undertaking botanical and other scientific work along the way. Instead of rejoining the fleet again in the fall of 1794 as planned, Haenke became engrossed with the local botany and settled in [[Cochabamba]], Bolivia to continue his scientific studies.

[[Image:Victoria amazonica, 2015-08-08, Phipps Conservatory, 08.jpg|thumb|left|''Victoria amazonica'', first identified by Haenke in 1801]]
For the next quarter-century, Haenke continued his botanical exploration of Bolivia, Peru and Brazil. In 1801 he made one of his most memorable discoveries, the giant water lily, ''[[Victoria amazonica]]'', with a six-foot wide lily pad. In addition, Haenke maintained his own botanic garden, owned a silver mine and served as the local physician in his adopted home town, Cochabamba. He is also credited with establishing the manufacture of saltpeter in Chile and helping to start the glass industry there.&lt;ref name="Beidleman" /&gt;

Although he had always hoped to return to Europe, Haenke died unexpectedly in 1816 when he was accidentally poisoned by his maid.&lt;ref name="Beidleman" /&gt; 

==Legacy==
When Malaspina returned from his voyage he became embroiled in a dispute with Spain's minister, [[Manuel de Godoy]], and was subsequently imprisoned for seven years. As a result, the official expedition report went unpublished for nearly a century, and many of the expedition's reports and findings were never released.&lt;ref name="Beidleman" /&gt;

Haenke's botanical collections consisting of more than 15.000 specimens were found in [[Cadiz]] after his death. They were bought in 1821 by the [[Czech National Museum]] and transferred to Prague. The Czech botanist [[Carl Bořivoj Presl]] spent nearly 15 years producing the "Reliquiae Haenkeanae" (published from 1825 to 1835), a work based on Haenke's botanical specimens collected in the Americas and the Philippines and purchased in Cadiz. Six volumes were produced but ultimately the work remained unfinished due to a lack of funds.&lt;ref name="Sterling" /&gt;

[[Haenke Island]] and Haenke Glacier in Alaska are named in his honor. A small private museum, "Muzeum Tadeáše Haenkeho", was established at Haenke's birth home in Chřibská, Czech Republic. 

Around 240 taxons carry his name, including:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="961">The '''Torani Canal''' in northeastern [[Guyana]] was constructed by BK International Inc. to transfer water from the [[Berbice River]] to the [[Canje River]]. The canal is 19 kilometres long. The contract was awarded to BK International Inc. by the Government of Guyana through a competitive bidding process.

The canal inlet on the Berbice River is located some 80 km from the sea where, although subject to tidal influence, flow is fresh throughout the year. A five-door [[sluice]] controls the flow of water into the canal.  The outlet on the Canje River is near the community of [[Wel te Vreeden]]. A three-door sluice controls flow out of the canal.

The Torani Canal also functions to flush saltwater out of the Canje River, especially during farm irrigation times.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9645">The '''United States Geography Olympiad''', often abbreviated as '''USGO''', is a nationwide academic geography competition for primary and secondary school students in the United States. It was introduced during the 2012-2013 school year. It currently consist of approximately 105 National Qualifying Exam sites held around the United States and its territories, along with a certain number of international schools, and a National Championships held in Arlington, VA at the end of April. The National Qualifying Exam sites are held in conjunction with the high school-level regional and state tournaments of [[National History Bee and Bowl|The National History Bee and The National History Bowl]].

The United States Geography Olympiad is also the official qualifying competition for American students looking to qualify for the [[International Geography Olympiad]], an international geography competition, which is held every summer in a different country. The international competition consists of three parts: a written test, a multimedia test and some fieldwork-related activity. James Mullen of Cupertino, CA, won the 2014 International Geography Olympiad while the USA finished 10th out of 36 countries overall.

The United States Geography Olympiad currently includes two categories: a Junior Varsity category and a Varsity category.  For each academic school year, students who are younger than 16 years of age, as of July 1 of the summer following the school year, can participate in the Junior Varsity category - there is no younger age limit. Students who are 16 or older (up to 19), as July 1 of the summer following the school year, must participate in the Varsity category. Only students in the Varsity category are eligible to qualify for the US National Team which will participate during that summer in the International Geography Olympiad.

The US Geography Olympiad is not associated with [[National Geographic (magazine)|National Geographic]] or the National Geographic Bee.

== History of the competition ==
The US Geography Olympiad was founded in the summer of 2012 under the name "United States Geography Challenge" by [[David Madden (Jeopardy! contestant)|David Madden]] and Enrico Contolini. David Madden is a former 19-day champion on Jeopardy!, who also serves as Executive Director for both The National History Bee and [[National History Bowl and Bee|The National History Bowl]]. Enrico Contolini is an engineer and self-taught geography enthusiast and researcher who coached his daughter Isabella to be the top female student nationally in the National Geographic Bee in both 2010 and 2011. The name of the competition was changed to the United States Geography Olympiad in October 2013.

Along with acting as the qualifying competition for American students looking to attend the International Geography Olympiad, the US Geography Olympiad was founded to test the geography skills of American students and to help promote geography education. The competition aims to reward students who have devoted themselves to studying the world, and its countries and peoples, as a thorough knowledge of geography is essential to being an educated citizen today. The US Geography Olympiad aims at being more than a competition, and for this reason it also runs a USGeoChallenge Facebook page where geography-related articles and news, quizzes, links to relevant websites and blogs are posted on a regular bases to foster educational discussions and opportunities for those interested in geography as a subject.

The Elementary and Middle School divisions were introduced in 2015. The Middle School division was divided into 7th and 8th grade divisions in 2016.

== Format of the competition ==
The Regional and/or State Qualifying event is currently organized as a 50 multiple-choice question written test to be completed in 20 minutes. Students may take the Qualifying Exam up to three times, as three different versions of the Exam are offered at different regional tournaments. To qualify for Nationals, students must finish in either the top half of the students in their division (Varsity or JV) at their site, or in the top 50% of students taking that particular version of the Qualifying Exam nationally. 

The National competition currently consists of three different events: A written exam, a map skills exam, and an 80 question multiple choice exam. Participants are given one hour to finish the first set of 40 multiple choice questions and the map skills exam. After a break, participants are given another hour to finish the second set of 40 multiple choice questions and the written exam. The written exam is based on the written exam at the International Geography Olympiad (iGeo), and the multiple choice exam is based on the multimedia exam at iGeo. 

After the competition, participants are given a rank score in each event, based on how their scores placed within that event. Any ties are shown by a .5 ranking; thus, a student that is tied for 1st place would have a rank score of 1.5. To determine participants' final rank, rank values in the three events are added together and ranked from greatest to least. The most favorable rank score would be 3.0, signifying that the participant ranked 1st in all three events. Rankings for Junior Varsity and Varsity divisions are separate, because the top 4 students in Varsity earn a seat in the US Team going to iGeo.

==Past locations==

The JV and Varsity Championships have always been held at the Crystal Gateway Marriott in the [[Crystal City, Arlington, Virginia|Crystal City]] neighborhood of [[Arlington, Virginia]].

In 2015, the Elementary and Middle School Championships were held at the Marriott Downtown Louisville in [[Louisville, Kentucky|Louisville]], [[Kentucky]]. In 2016, the Elementary, 7th Grade, and 8th Grade Championships were held at the Hyatt Regency O'Hare in [[Rosemont, Illinois]]. The Hyatt Regency O'Hare also hosted the Elementary and Middle School Championships for 2017 on Memorial Day weekend. In 2018, the Middle School and Elementary National Championships were held at the Atlanta Marriott Marquis.
