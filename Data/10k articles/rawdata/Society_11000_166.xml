[[File:Monumento a Esteban Echeverría 2.JPG|thumb|right|A statue in Buenos Aires honoring [[Esteban Echeverría]] remembers his words: "You Argentine fight for the May Democracy and your cause is not only legitimate but also saint in the eyes of God and the free nations of the world" &lt;small&gt;(''Vosotros argentinos lucháis por la democracia de Mayo y vuestra causa no sólo es legítima sino también santa ante los ojos de Dios y de los pueblos libres del mundo'')&lt;/small&gt;. On the other side it says "Slaves, or men subdue to an absolute power, don't have homeland, because homeland is not connected to the place of birth, but in the free exercise of the citizen rights." &lt;small&gt;(''Los esclavos, o los hombres sometidos al poder absoluto, no tienen patria, porque la patria no se vincula a la tierra natal, sino en el libre ejercicio de los derechos ciudadanos.'')&lt;/small&gt;]]

The '''1837 generation''' ({{lang-es|Generación del '37}}) was an Argentine intellectual movement named after the date a literary hall with most of its members was established. Influenced by the new [[Romanticism|romantic]] ideas, they rejected the cultural Spanish heritage of the country. They did not acknowledge any national roots in the [[Indigenous peoples in Argentina|indigenous peoples]] or the period of European colonization, focusing instead on the Revolution as the birth of the country, as it gave them freedom, the possibility of behave as free people. They considered themselves "sons of the [[May Revolution]]", they were born shortly after it, and wrote some of the earliest Argentine literary works.

The group established a literary hall in 1837 in Buenos Aires, hence the name. This ''Salón Literario'' closed six months after it was created because of the reiterated warnings from the government. Initially, they claimed to be neutral in the [[Argentine Civil Wars]], they wrote works biased against the [[Federales (Argentina)|federal]] governor [[Juan Manuel de Rosas]] (such as ''[[El Matadero]]'' by [[Esteban Echeverría]] or ''[[Facundo]]'' by [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]]) because Rosas were the Buenos Aires government on that time, but they were also against the former [[Unitarian Party|Unitarian]] governments, with whom they didn't agree in their absolutist manners that were considered by them as a mere restoration of the manners of the Spanish colony. Their efforts to install a full democratic Republic and guarantees of the civil rights by means of a peaceful ''propaganda'' were vains and shortly after that they ended up exiled or assassinated. After Rosas was overthrown in 1852, their writings were inspirers of the first [[Argentine Constitution]] in 1853, and their persons promoters of the ''Organización Nacional'', the articulation and organization of the political divisions, infrastructure and institutions of the country, that in its final form didn't was federal nor unitarian but a balance of both.

They were called "unitarians" in a loose sense and by Rosas ''propaganda''.

Some notable members of this generation were [[Esteban Echeverría]], [[Juan Bautista Alberdi]], [[Juan María Gutiérrez]], [[Domingo Faustino Sarmiento]] who was president between 1868 and 1874, [[Miguel Cané (senior)]], [[Bartolomé Mitre]], [[Andrés Lamas]], [[Antonio Somellera]], [[Vicente Fidel López]], [[Carlos Tejedor (politician)|Carlos Tejedor]], [[Juan Bautista Peña]], [[Florencio Varela (writer)|Florencio Varela]], [[Juan Cruz Varela]], [[José Mármol]], [[José Rivera Indarte]] (Buenos Aires), [[Quiroga Rosas]], [[Antonino Aberastain]], [[Santiago Cortínez]] (San Juan), [[Benjamín Villafañe]], [[Félix Frías]] (Tucumán), [[Francisco Álvarez (actor)|Francisco Álvarez]], [[Paulino Paz]], Enrique Rodríguez, [[Avelino Ferreyra]], [[Ramón Ferreyra]] (Córdoba), [[Juan Thompson]] (Corrientes).

Abdur Rahim Popalzai II  played a leading role in the events which lead up to the [[Qissa Khwani Bazaar massacre|Qissa Khwani massacre]] and was sentenced to nine years in prison for his role in the uprising. Abdur Rahim Popalzai [II] borrowed his anti-imperialist ideology from [[Maulana Obaidullah Sindhi]] and [[Husain Ahmad Madani|Maulana Hussain Ahmed Madani]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/740873/a-popalzai-lune-the-writing-on-qasim-khan-mosques-walls/|title=A Popalzai Lune: The writing on Qasim Khan mosque’s walls - The Express Tribune|date=26 July 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1939, Abdur Rahim Popalzai II protested in Bannu against the British bombing Waziristan, for which he was sentenced to five years imprisonment.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

'''Albanians of Croatia''' are an autochthonous [[national minority]] recognized by the [[Constitution of Croatia]]. As such, they elect a special representative to the [[Croatian Parliament]], shared with members of four other national minorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.sabor.hr/Default.aspx?art=1874 | language = Croatian | publisher = Croatian Parliament | title = Pravo pripadnika nacionalnih manjina u Republici Hrvatskoj na zastupljenost u Hrvatskom saboru | work = Zakon o izborima zastupnika u Hrvatski sabor | accessdate = 2011-12-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[2011 Croatian census]], there were 17,513 [[Albanians]] living in Croatia, 0.41% of total population. The largest religious groups among the Albanians were [[Muslims]] (9,594 or 54.8% of them) and [[Catholics]] (7,109 or 40.6% of them).&lt;ref name="census2011-ethnorelig"&gt;{{cite web | work = Census of Population, Households and Dwellings 2011 | url = http://www.dzs.hr/Eng/censuses/census2011/results/htm/E01_01_12/E01_01_12.html | title = 4.

In the 1712/14 census done in Lika and Krbava among [[Vlachs of Croatia|Vlach]] population, and other documents, many surnames with Albanian and [[Arbanasi people|Arbanasi]] word roots were recorded, such as those with suffixes "-aj" (e.g. Bulaja, Mataija, Šolaja, Saraja, Suknajić, Rapajić), "-ez" (Kokez, Kekez, Ivez, Malez etc.), and others (Šimleša, Šimrak, Šinđo/a/n, Šintić, Kalember, Flego, Macura, Cecić, Kekić, Zotović etc.).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation| last=Šarić| first=Marko| author-link=| editor=Željko Holjevac| year=2009| title=Identitet Like: Korijeni i razvitak| volume=1| contribution=Predmoderne etnije u Lici i Krbavi prema popisu iz 1712./14.| publisher=Institut društvenih znanosti Ivo Pilar| place=Zagreb| page=370| language=Croatian| isbn=978-953-6666-65-2| url=http://www.pilar.hr/images/stories/dokumenti/lika/lika_1_mail_r_325.pdf| access-date=2014-12-18| archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150924073300/http://www.pilar.hr/images/stories/dokumenti/lika/lika_1_mail_r_325.pdf| archive-date=2015-09-24| dead-url=yes| df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Prezimenik I"&gt;{{cite book| author=P.

Albanians came to Croatia in various historical periods. In the Middle Ages they lived in coastal cities and some were assimilated with Vlachs, in the 17th and 18th century the [[Arbanasi people]] settled the area around [[Zadar]], and in modern time they came as seasonal workers, war refugees or sportspeople. Many people in Croatia descended from earlier waves of Albanian migration bear surnames of linguistically Albanian origin, but do not speak [[Albanian language|the language]] and are not considered to be Albanians.&lt;ref name="Prezimenik I"/&gt;

==History==
In the Middle Ages there was a large [[Albanians|Albanian]] community in Ragusa (today's [[Dubrovnik]]). In a document dating from 1285 from there, the sentence Audivi unam vocem clamantem in monte in lingua albanesca ("I heard a calling voice from the mountains in [[Albanian language") is handed down. This is the oldest written record of the [[Albanian language]] per se.

Some of them came to Croatian lands at the time of Venetian rule because in parts of [[Croatia]] and [[Albania]] were under the rule of the Venetian Republic. Thus through the internal migration, the Albanian families also migrated, of which a large number was croatianized over the centuries to come. Internal migration has been of economic nature.

Another period is the time of liberation wars against the [[Ottomans]] when Christian [[Albanians|Albanian]] families migrated to the liberated territories of [[Croatia]].

At the time of [[Yugoslavia]], [[Albanians]] migrated to [[Croatia]] for economic and political reasons, especially after 1945. [[Albanians|Albanian]] migrants were mainly from [[Kosovo]] and the [[Republic of Macedonia]].

Traditionally, Croatian [[Albanians]] have been involved with jewelery, filigree, bakery and restaurant management, such as bakeries and confectioners.

====Croatian War for Independence====
During the [[Croatian War for Independence]], according to the Association of Volunteers of the Homeland War, Croatia has protected 2,579 Albanian volunteers in 1991, of whom 86 were killed, 37 were missing and more than 500 were injured. Among them were generals ([[Rahim Ademi]] and [[Agim Çeku]]) and some famous soldiers, out of which 270 officers.

===Arbanasi===
The [[Arbanasi people|Arbanasi]] (Albanian also Arbëreshët e Zarës "Albanians of Zadar") are a small population group in [[Croatia]] still existing today. They are ethnically Catholic [[Albanians]] who fled the [[Ottomans]] between 1726 and 1733 in the Croatian coastal country, where they are still present today. In the city of [[Zadar]] they founded their own named after them district, which persists to this day. The Arbanasi traditionally speak a different dialect of Albanian.

'''Anti-mask''' or '''anti-masking laws''' refer to legislative or penal initiatives that seek to stop individuals from concealing their faces, who do so often to go unidentified during a crime.

==North America==

===United States===
There are anti-mask laws in many U.S. states and the [[District of Columbia]].&lt;ref name= anapsid&gt;[http://www.anapsid.org/cnd/mcs/maskcodes.html CND: State Codes Related To Wearing Masks]&lt;/ref&gt;
* New York State's anti-mask law was enacted in 1845, to provide for public safety after disputes between landlords and tenants.&lt;ref name="cnn" /&gt;
* Many anti-mask laws date back to the mid-20th century when states and municipalities, passed them to stop the violent activities of the [[Ku Klux Klan]], whose members typically wore [[Ku Klux Klan hood|hoods]] of white linen to conceal their identities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.splcenter.org/fighting-hate/intelligence-report/1999/unmasking-klan|title=UNMASKING THE KLAN|newspaper=Southern Poverty Law Center|date=1999-09-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://codes.findlaw.com/ny/penal-law/pen-sect-240-35.html|title=New York Penal Law – PEN § 240.35 {{!}} FindLaw|newspaper=Findlaw|access-date=2017-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* In the 21st century those laws have been applied to political protesters such as those affiliated with the [[Occupy Movement]] or [[Anonymous (group)|Anonymous]] – wearing [[Guy Fawkes mask]]s.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dcist.com/2012/10/occupys_halloween_party_might_break.php Occupy's Halloween Party Might Break D.C.'s Anti-Mask Law] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141018035022/http://dcist.com/2012/10/occupys_halloween_party_might_break.php |date=2014-10-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://nymag.com/daily/intelligencer/2011/09/old_anti-mask_law_foiling_wall.html |title=Old Anti-Mask Law Foils Wall Street Protestors |last=Coscarelli |first=Joe |date=September 20, 2011 |work=Daily Intelligencer |access-date=2018-07-13 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://www.aclu.org/free-speech/hi-oh-silver-aclu-challenges-michigan-anti-mask-law-behalf-lone-ranger-protesters With a 'Hi-Oh, Silver!'

* In some areas motorcyclists have been arrested using anti-masking laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.motorcycleprofilingproject.com/bikers-arrested-wearing-bandanas/|title=Bikers Arrested for Wearing Bandanas|date=2016-11-29|newspaper=Motorcycle Profiling Project|language=en-US|access-date=2016-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These laws have been challenged on the grounds that they violate the guarantees of the [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution]] to free speech and free association.  Some courts have weighed freedom of speech against the public safety interest, and upheld such laws.  For example, the Georgia Supreme Court found the law constitutional on the grounds that the wearing of the mask was an act of intimidation and a threat of violence, which is not protected speech.&lt;ref name="nyt"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/12/06/us/georgia-supreme-court-reinstates-ban-on-wearing-of-klan-masks.html |title=Georgia Supreme Court Reinstates Ban on Wearing of Klan Masks |last=Applebome  |first=Peter  |date=1990-12-06 |access-date=2018-07-13 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  That law has exceptions for holiday celebrations, theatre performances, and occupational safety; the ruling makes it unclear if someone is violating the law if they wear a mask without the intent to threaten violence.  A three-judge panel of the [[United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit]] upheld a New York law on the ground that wearing a Ku Klux Klan mask did not convey a protected message beyond that conveyed by wearing a hood and robe.&lt;ref name="cnn"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.cnn.com/2004/LAW/01/23/antimask.ruling |title=Justice not so clear-cut over laws directed at Klan |last=Drew |first=Kevin |date=Jan 23, 2004 |access-date=2018-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Other courts have struck down anti-mask laws.  For example, Tennesee and Florida state laws have been invalidated on the grounds that they were unconstitutionally broad.&lt;ref name="nyt" /&gt; An ordinance in [[Goshen, Indiana]], was struck down based on First Amendment doctrine that [[First Amendment to the United States Constitution#Anonymous speech|specifically protects]] anonymous speech and anonymous association, especially for unpopular groups like the KKK.&lt;ref name="cnn" /&gt;

===Canada===
* After several high-profile protests, the [[Canadian Parliament]] introduced [[Bill C-309]], which bans the wearing of masks during a riot or other unlawful assembly.&lt;ref&gt;[http://vancouver.mediacoop.ca/story/canadian-anti-masking-bill-imminent/10849 Canadian Anti-Masking Bill Imminent]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/canada/police-chiefs-back-anti-mask-bill-1.1061197 Police chiefs back anti-mask bill]&lt;/ref&gt; The bill became law on June 19, 2013.&lt;ref&gt;Meagan Fitzpatrick, CBC News Wearing a mask at a riot is now a crime http://www.cbc.ca/news/politics/story/2013/06/19/pol-mask-bill-royal-assent.html&lt;/ref&gt; Those convicted of it face up to 10 years in prison.&lt;ref&gt;[http://rt.com/news/canadians-ten-years-protesting-masks-965/ Mask ban: Canada's veiled protesters face 10 years' jail]&lt;/ref&gt;
* Canada's Criminal code, Section 351(2),  also covers "Disguise with Intent", whereby "Every one who, with intent to commit an indictable offence, has his face masked or coloured or is otherwise disguised is guilty of an indictable offence and liable to imprisonment for a term not exceeding ten years". With some exceptions, an indictable offence in Canada is one that is subject to a fine of greater than $5,000 or imprisonment of more than six months.
* in 2017 a [[Quebec ban on face covering]] for transition and government services became publicized.

=== Overview ===
{{Expand section|date=June 2018}}
The present table provides a non-exhaustive overview comparing legal restrictions of face coverings in European states. The 2010 [[French ban on face covering]] is widely regarded as the most strict, prohibiting face coverings in almost all situations in public places, as opposed to limited restrictions in countries such as Denmark that only outlaws such practices in the context of public assemblies such as demonstrations.

=== Austria ===
* In Austria since 2002 masking ban on demonstrations under § 9 of the Assembly Law (Versammlungsgesetz). Violation of the ban need not be prosecuted if the mask does not threaten public order and security. Violation of the ban entails, according to § 19a.b of the Law, imprisonment up to six months, repeated offenses one year or a fine.
* Parliament approved new legislation on 16 May 2017, which stipulates that people who wear clothing that covers their faces, such as burqas, niqabs, full face helmets or scarves (motorcyclists) etc. in places like universities, public transportation or courthouses will face fines of 150 euros (about $167). The measure took effect in October 2017.&lt;ref name="Bilefsky"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/05/17/world/europe/austria-veil-ban-muslim.html |title=Austrian Parliament Bans Full Facial Veils in Public |author=Dan Bilefsky and Victor Homola |work=The New York Times |date=17 May 2017 |accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Noack"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/worldviews/wp/2017/10/09/austria-wanted-to-ban-burqas-now-it-also-fines-mascots-and-stops-cyclists-who-wear-scarves/? |title=Austria's new anti-burqa law isn't quite working as intended |author=Rick Noack |work=The Washington Post |date=9 October 2017 |accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after the enactment on 1 October 2017, there were some incidents in which people were incorrectly fined by the police, leading some commentators to point out flaws in the law, or incorrect understanding of it amongst the police.&lt;ref name="Noack"/&gt;

=== Belgium ===
A Belgian law adopted in June 2011 prohibits appearing in public "with a face masked or hidden, in whole or in part, in such a way as to be unidentifiable". Violations can result in fines and up to seven days in jail. On 11 July 2017 the ban in Belgium was upheld by the [[European Court of Human Rights]] (ECHR) after having been challenged by two Muslim women who claimed their rights had been infringed.&lt;ref name="Belgium17"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/world/2017/07/11/Top-Europe-court-upholds-ban-on-full-face-veil-in-Belgium-.html|title=Top Europe court upholds ban on full-face veil in Belgium |author= |work=Al-Arabiyya English |date=11 July 2017|website=|access-date=11 July 2017|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170713141738/http://english.alarabiya.net/en/News/world/2017/07/11/Top-Europe-court-upholds-ban-on-full-face-veil-in-Belgium-.html|archivedate=13 July 2017|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denmark ===
* Wearing masks during assemblies in a public place is illegal in Denmark.&lt;ref name="GreenLeft Weekly"&gt;{{cite web|author=Name: * |url=https://www.greenleft.org.au/node/43081 |title=Denmark: Police brutalise climate protesters &amp;#124; Green Left Weekly |publisher=Greenleft.org.au |date=2010-01-23 |accessdate=2014-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Danish penal code (Straffeloven) § 134 b, which was inserted with effect from 3 June 2000, makes the violation punishable by a fine or up to six months imprisonment. Part 2 of § 134 b further criminalizes the possession of effects which must be viewed as intended to be used for masking in an assembly. The §134 b, part 3, exempts from penalty masking which is done to protect one's face against the weather.&lt;ref name="Maskeringsforbud"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.retsinformation.dk/Forms/R0710.aspx?id=832 |title=LOV nr 440 af 31/05/2000 om ændring af straffeloven (Maskeringsforbud) |work=retsinformation.dk |publisher=Civilstyrelsen |accessdate=27 June 2018 |language=da}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ban does not apply in [[Greenland]] or the [[Faroe Islands]].&lt;ref name="Maskeringsforbud"/&gt;

=== France ===
* The [[French ban on face covering]] is an act of parliament passed by the Senate of France on 14 September 2010, resulting in the ban on the wearing of face-covering headgear, including masks, helmets, balaclava, niqābs and other veils covering the face in public places, except under specified circumstances.

=== Germany ===
* Since 1985, according to § 17a Abs. 2 Versammlungsgesetz you may not disguise your identity in public meetings such as demonstrations so the police are able to identify you. This violation can be fined with imprisonment up to one year.&lt;ref name="Dejure"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://dejure.org/gesetze/VersG/17a.html |title=§ 17a VersG |publisher=dejure.org |date= |accessdate=2014-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
In Italy, a law issued in 1975 strictly forbids wearing of any attire that could hide the face of a person. Penalties (fines and imprisonment) are provided for such behaviour. The original purpose of the anti-mask law was to prevent crime or terrorism. The law allows for exemptions for a "justified cause", which has sometimes been interpreted by courts as including religious reasons for wearing a veil, but others –including local governments– disagree and claim religion is not a "justified cause" in this context.&lt;ref name="BBCItaly"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/8658017.stm |title=Police stop Muslim woman wearing veil in Italy |work=BBC News |date=3 May 2010 |accessdate=27 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Latvia ===
In Latvia, a law issued in 2016 to ban niqab and burqa in entire country was passed by Latvian parliament.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/islamic-muslim-face-veil-niqab-burqa-banned-latvia-despite-being-worn-by-just-three-women-entire-a6993991.html Independent.co.uk: Islamic face veil to be banned in Latvia despite being worn by just three women in entire country]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Netherlands ===
In the Netherlands, a first attempt towards a partial prohibition on face covering was made from 2012 to 2015, but the bill was struck down. A new attempt was made in the years after when a new bill was submitted on 27 November 2015. Eventually a limited anti-mask law was passed on 26 June 2018. The law is called ''Instelling van een gedeeltelijk verbod op het dragen van gezichtsbedekkende kleding in het onderwijs, het openbaar vervoer, overheidsgebouwen en de zorg (Wet gedeeltelijk verbod gezichtsbedekkende kleding)'' ("Introduction of a partial ban on the wearing of face-covering clothing in education, public transport, governmental buildings and healthcare (Partial Face-Covering Clothing Ban Act)"). It is illegal to wear clothing which covers the entire face, or covered up to the point where only the eyes are uncovered, or renders the face unrecognisable, on public transport and in buildings and associated yards of educational institutions, governmental institutions and healthcare institutions. Frequently cited examples are a [[Motorcycle helmet|full face helmet]], a [[Balaclava (clothing)|balaclava]], a [[burqa]] or a [[niqāb]]. Clothes exempt from the Act are: 
*those worn by clients, patients or their visitors in residential parts of healthcare institutions;
*those necessary for the protection of the body in relation to health or security;
*those necessary in relation to the requirements made to the performance of a profession or sport.

On 26 June 2018, the bill was passed in the [[Senate (Netherlands)|Dutch Senate]].&lt;ref name="Nu.nl"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.nu.nl/politiek/5332217/eerste-kamer-stemt-in-met-boerkaverbod.html |title=Eerste Kamer stemt in met 'boerkaverbod' |work=nu.nl |date=26 June 2018 |accessdate=26 June 2018 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.eerstekamer.nl/wetsvoorstel/34349_wet_gedeeltelijk_verbod |title=Wet gedeeltelijk verbod gezichtsbedekkende kleding |publisher=Dutch Senate |accessdate=27 June 2018 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Rijksoverheid"&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://www.rijksoverheid.nl/actueel/nieuws/2018/06/26/gedeeltelijk-verbod-gezichtsbedekkende-kleding |title=Gedeeltelijk verbod gezichtsbedekkende kleding |publisher=Rijksoverheid |date=26 June 2018 |accessdate=27 June 2018 |language=nl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Norway ===
According to § 11, part 5 of the police statute (politiloven) from 1995, it is prohibited to be masked during an event taking place in public. Exempted from the prohibition are participants in theatre, masquerade or similar.

=== Spain ===
According to the November 2013 ''[[Citizens' Security Law]]'' ({{lang|es|[[:es:Ley mordaza|Ley mordaza]]}}), demonstration protesters who cover their faces may be fined up to [[€]]30,000.&lt;ref name="mordaza"&gt;{{cite web| url= https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/11/29/us-spain-security-idUSBRE9AS0MX20131129| title= Spain's anti-protest bill criticized as anti-democratic| publisher= Reuters| accessdate= 2014-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Sweden ===
* According to the 2005 'Law on the Prohibition of masking in some cases', it is prohibited for participants in the demonstration to fully or partially cover the face in a way that complicates identification. This prohibition applies only if there are disturbances of public order at demonstrations, or if there is an immediate danger of such disturbances. The ban does not apply to the covering of the face for religious reasons. It also does not apply to the extent participants are authorized (under 2 Ch. 7 a § Order Act) to fully or partially cover the face.&lt;ref name="Lagen"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://lagen.nu/2005:900 |title=Lag (2005:900) om förbud mot maskering i vissa fall |publisher=Lagen.nu |date=2006-01-01 |accessdate=2014-02-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== United Kingdom ===
* During the [[2011 United Kingdom anti-austerity protests]] one of the temporary policies discussed in the [[Cabinet Office Briefing Room|COBRA]] meeting was to ban the covering of the face during the riots. Generally only enforced in areas in a riot stage, none were arrested solely for wearing masks, only ordered to take them off. However, many arrested who committed other crimes, such as looting and attacking police officers, were charged with failing to adhere to the mask ban as well as all the other infringements when placed before the court.{{citation needed|date=January 2016}}
* For a century, covering or blacking one's face was a criminal act that could lead to the death penalty; the [[Black Act]] was repealed in 1823.

== Asia-Pacific ==

=== Australia ===
* It is legal by all rights to wear masks in public. Police, notably in Victoria, have petitioned the state and territory governments to make it illegal unless a person has a valid reason for why they are/should be allowed to wear a mask in public.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.heraldsun.com.au/news/law-order/wearing-a-mask-while-protesting-may-soon-be-illegal-following-violent-brawl/news-story/e16436faef8c95f1715a4977ac0fccbf?nk=ef5d630675fec993ed86fdb22bc2f981-1485184012|title=Wearing a mask while protesting may soon be illegal following violent brawl|last=|first=|date=2016-04-04|work=|access-date=2017-01-23|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15787">[[File:Assyrianfolkdance.jpg|thumb|260px|right|Folk dance in an Assyrian party.]]
'''Assyrian folk dances''' are sets of [[dance]]s that are performed throughout the world by [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]], mostly on occasions such as [[wedding]]s, community parties and other jubilant events.&lt;ref&gt;Andrae, W. Farbige kemik aus Assur, Fig. 29, s.24&lt;/ref&gt;

Assyrian folk dances are mainly made up of [[circle dance]]s that are performed in a line, which may be straight, curved, or both. Most of the dances allow unlimited number of participants, with the exception of the ''Sabre Dance'', which require three at most. Assyrian dances would vary from weak to strong, depending on the mood and [[tempo]] of a song.

Assyrian folk dances belong to five [[time signature|metric groups]]: {{music|time|2|4}} (10 dances), {{music|time|4|4}} (6 dances), {{music|time|6|8}} (13 dances), {{music|time|9|8}} (1 dance), {{music|time|10|8}} (1 dance). The tempo would usually range from slow (70 Beats Per Minute) to very fast (140 beats).&lt;ref&gt;Stauder, W. Harfen Und Leiern Vorderasiens im Babylonischer under Assyrischer Zeit, s. 51-55, 36-38&lt;/ref&gt;

==Technique==
[[File:Assyriankhigga.jpg|thumb|right|230px|[[Traditional clothing|Lore clothing]] may be worn in the [[folk dance]].]]
All Assyrians dances, with the exception of the ''Sabre Dance'', are done in a connected circle. Most Assyrian line dances are itinerant dances and move laterally. In an open floor space, the lines assume open circular shapes where they tend to curve and acquire [[spiral]] shapes as determined by floor space availability.&lt;ref&gt;Engel, Carl. The Musik of the most ancient nation, London, 1864.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are only five ways of moving the body; ''Step, leap, run, hop'' and ''jump''. The legs are also used to stamp, stomp and kick. The arms are used predominantly and they'd usually move independently of the legs. Arm gestures include [[Deflection (physics)|bouncing]], swinging forward and back, moving side-to-side, lifting above the head and [[clapping]].

In many dances, the torso, along with the shoulders and arms, bounce up and down rhythmically. [[Stomp (strike)|Stomp]]s and stamps are also executed in Assyrian folk dances. Knee bends, deep [[Squatting position|squat]]s and leg extensions are a regular occurrence in Assyrian dance.&lt;ref&gt;Anca Giurchescu, Sunni Bloland; Romanian Traditional Dance; Wild Flower Press; Mill Valley, California; 1995&lt;/ref&gt;

The connections include, hand-to-hand, hand to shoulder, and hand to hip, with hand-to-hand being the most popular. The hand-to-hand type has three connections; The "W", the "V" and the "T". The "W" arm hold is the most common where the arms are raised into the "W" position (or, at least, it appears to look like the letter W). The "T" dance is where hands are placed on other participants's shoulders. This is the least common dance of the three.&lt;ref&gt;Subhi Anwar Rashid, Mesopotamien, Abb 137&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dances ==
===Fast pace===
{{Assyrian culture}}
*'''''Siskany''''': The Siskany dance involves the participants briskly shaking their shoulders where they move their limbs energetically, with an emphasis on their feet in a zippy manner. Sometimes the khigga beat is geared up to this to indicate a climactic end. The pulsating tempo is consanguineous to the [[electronic dance music]] and [[dance-pop]] found in western music. It goes by the time signature of {{music|time|4|4}} and the tempo is around 120-135bpm. 
*'''''Gubbare''''': Mostly danced at the end of a party. The music is fast, lively and upbeat, akin to a [[jig]]. The music accompanying the dance is typically in the [[major key]]. [[Little finger|Pinkies]] interlock, dancers repeatedly go forward and back in motion in the circle. Popular song in a gubareh beat is ''Tom Tom'' by [[Linda George (Assyrian singer)|Linda George]]. Gubareh is in {{music|time|4|4}} and its tempo is around 125-135bmp.
*'''''Bablaka''''': Fervently danced, with pinkies interlocking, where they (hands and arms too) move up and down energetically and perennially.&lt;ref&gt;Rudolf Laban, The Mastery of Movement; Boston: Plays; 1950.&lt;/ref&gt; But unlike ''gubareh'', the participant is more stable where they will not prance forward and backwards in the dance floor. Motion is intemperately focused on arms, shoulders and hands in ''bablaka''. Dancers may also rhythmically bend knees. The beat is virtually homogeneous to ''gubareh''. It also danced at the end of parties. The meter is {{music|time|4|4}} and tempo is around 125-130bpm.
*'''''Belaty''''': The dance is accompanied by a moderately fast-paced [[Arab pop|Arabic rhythm]] (similar to [[belly dancing]] music). Dancers would connect hand-to-hand in the circle, lift legs to the beat whilst making a slight leap and kick their legs to the sides in the air (this would repeat). An example of a notable song with a belaty beat is ''Ahela Yoni'' by [[Ashur Bet Sargis]]. Becoming somewhat rare and unwonted recently, with songs traditionally in its rhythm being played and danced to in the slower ''Bagiyeh'' or ''Peda'' beat. The beat is 125-135bpm. {{music|time|4|4}}.
*'''''Tolama''''': Lively and energetic dance where the participants constantly jump and kick legs in the air repeatedly (similar in fashion to ''belaty'' and ''gubareh''), whilst also moving their torso forward and backwards. It also danced at the end of parties after Gubbareh, but it is not as commonly practiced as Gubbareh. Notable song in this beat is ''Shoshonla'' by [[Shamiram Urshan]]. The time signature is {{music|time|2|4}} and temp is 125-140bpm.
*'''''[[sword dance|The Sabre Dance]]''''': A [[solo dance]] that usually involves one to three participants. As the dance starts, the [[sword]] bearer dances by himself, waving his sword and holding his shield (a shield is optional, though). The dance represents the symbolic surrender of the [[bride]] to the [[groom]] and his family. In weddings, it is performed by the closest male relatives of the couple. The rhythm is a {{music|time|6|8}} duple meter, and this gives a "springy" feeling to the dance.&lt;ref&gt;Subhi Anwar Rashid, Mesopotamien (Musikgeschichte in Bildern, Leipzig 1984, S. 130 Abb 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Moderate pace===
[[File:Assyrianfolkcostume.png|thumb|230px|Assyrian youth in folk costume dancing khigga.]]
*'''''[[Khigga]]''''': The most popular Assyrian dance and the most common dance beat in Assyrian music. Individuals hold hands with the line or circle following around the dance floor where they gently move one leg forward, backward and repeat with the next leg. Khigga is the most simplest of Assyrian folk dance. Its music is the first beat that is played when welcoming the [[bride]] and [[groom]] to the [[wedding reception|reception]] hall. There is a slightly slower variant of this dance where the participants connect with their pinkies instead, though it is not to be confused with the slower ''Georgina'' dance. A notable song with this beat is ''Moralon'' by [[Evin Agassi]]. Furthermore, the term ''khigga'' is also occasionally used to denote all the Assyrian folk circle dances, i.e. "Khigga'd belaty" ("khigga of belaty"), "khigga'd gubareh", etc. Khigga goes by the [[time signature]] of {{music|time|4|4}} with moderate [[tempo]] between 105-115bpm. 
*'''''Heavy Khigga (Khigga Yaqoora)''''': Virtually the same dance as above, except the tempo is 'heavier' where the participants would make more ardent and exaggerated moves, as its name suggests, namely knee bending. It is not to be confused with ''Siskani'', as that dance beat is faster and has distinguishing techniques. Connection can also be made by pinkies. Examples of songs having this beat is ''Zayno Mala'' by David Simon. Heavy khigga goes by the [[time signature]] of {{music|time|4|4}} with [[tempo]] between 115-120bpm.
*'''''[[Tamzara|Tanzara]]''''': Legend has it that the dance was brought to Anatolia by the Ancient [[Assyrian people|Assyrians]] during there conquest of the region in the [[Assyrian empire]] in commemoration to the god of food and vegetation. Dancers connect by holding hands in the circle or line, go forwards and backwards by making a little knee bending. Uncommon than above dances. The time signature is {{music|time|2|4}} and tempo is 115-125bpm.
*'''''[[Kochari]]''''': The notable attribute of this dance is that the participants are connected by arms-on-arms (akin to [[dabke]]). Each leg makes a kick in a repetitive manner. Common among Assyrians in Syria. Very rare among other Assyrians. {{music|time|2|4}}, 110-120bmp

===Slow pace===
* '''''Sheikhani''''': One of the more older dances, Sheikhani is more laid-back, albeit bouncy, and slightly slower than khigga. The main movement is [[two-step (dance move)|two-step]]. The two-step begins with the right foot (right-left-right) and is then repeated with the left foot (left-right-left). Hands are interlocked, left arm is bent at the elbow and pressed against the back, right arm held forward against the back of the dancer in front. The dancers go forward a couple steps in, with their arms at their sides and at the same time, kick into the center. After that, they immediately step back out. A notable song with a sheikhani beat is ''Wye Wye Minakh'' by [[Sargon Gabriel]]. Sheykhani is {{music|time|4|4}} in time signature and is 90-105bpm.
*'''''Bagiye''''': Evolved from Sheikhani, Bagiyeh has a move where the dancers slowly turn to face the back of the dancer in front or side of them, leisurely kick both legs in the air, then brusquely raise hands into air whilst making a sharp rotation. The dancers would turn to the right; their hands are hooked to one another by the fingers, the right arm is bent in front of the body, and the left arm is bent in behind the back. Although similar, bagiye is sluggish and more onerous than sheikhany. There is a homogeneous variant of this dance called ''Peda'' with particularised sets of songs, popularised by singer-songwriter [[Adwar Mousa]] in [[Syria]]. The dance beat has gotten popular in the late 2000s and 2010s, with songs traditionally in the ''belaty'' rhythm being played in this beat. Notable song with a bagiyeh beat is ''Yalekhta'' by Linda George. Bagiyeh is {{music|time|4|4}} in time signature and is 80-95bpm.
*'''''Georgina''''':  A [[Kurdish dance|Kurdish]]-inspired dance that's slow paced and usually accompanied by [[sentimental ballad]]s (one popular song being ''Zereneh'' by [[Janan Sawa]]). The music tends have a [[Turkish music|Turkish]] and [[Kurdish music|Kurdish]] flavour. Dancers hold the pinkie or little finger and move them rhythmically (akin to ''bablaka'', albeit gently). It is more common among Chaldean Assyrians. The tempo is around 70bpm-80bpm. {{music|time|3|4}}.
*'''''Chobi''''': A modern circle dance found in [[Iraqi music]]. It is participated by [[Iraqi Assyrians]]. The dance is similar to ''khigga'', but it would have more pronounced leg elevation and swaying. Each leg swiftly kicks to the air and repeats. Arms sway forwards and backwards. Songs may usually be in [[Iraqi Arabic]], but a few Assyrian songs such as ''Teela Teela'' by Evin Agassi would have this rhythm. The tempo is around 95bpm-100bpm.&lt;ref&gt;Subhi Anwar Rashid, The History of Musical Instruments in Old Iraq, Fig. 41 (In Arabic)&lt;/ref&gt;
*'''''Arabanoo''''': A slow circle dance where dancers interconnect with pinkies and sway tardily around in a circle. Mostly practiced among Urmian Assyrians. It is not to confused with Georgina as it is slower and more serene in comparison. ''Aywateh'' by Evin Agassi utilizes this beat. Uncommon. {{music|time|6|8}}, 52-66bpm
*'''''Azia Tamma''''': Similar to ''sheikhani'' in terms of pace, but with more steps that go forward and backwards (or reverse) a notch. Not common. {{music|time|2|4}}, 82-88bpm

{{Azerbaijanis}}
'''Azerbaijanis in Kazakhstan''' ({{lang-az|Qazaxıstan azərbaycanlıları}}) are part of the [[Azerbaijani diaspora]].

[[File:Block_party_(Manhattan,_October_4_2008).jpg|thumb|right|A block party in [[Manhattan]]]]
A '''block party''' or '''street party''' is a [[party]] in which many members of a single [[community]] congregate, either to observe an event of some importance or simply for mutual enjoyment.  The name comes from the form of the party, which often involves closing an entire [[city block]] to vehicle traffic.  Many times, there will be a celebration in the form of playing [[music]] and [[dance]] and activities like pony rides, inflatable slides, popcorn machines and [[barbecue]]s.

As a form of [[activism]] street parties are festive and/or artistic efforts to reclaim roadways as public space by large groups of people. They were made known in Western Europe and North America by the actions of [[Reclaim the Streets]],{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}} a widespread "dis-organization" dedicated to reclaiming public space from automobiles and [[consumerism]].

==Poland==
Poland [[Orange Alternative]] staged festive protests to break the [[Communist]] [[government]]'s monopoly on public life.{{citation needed|date=May 2018}}

[[File:Royal wedding street parties main 480 29april2011.jpg|thumb|right|A street party in [[London]] for the 2011 Royal Wedding]]
In the UK, street parties are mainly known as private residents' events and have a special cultural meaning. They have historically been held to commemorate major national events, such as [[VE Day]] or the Queen's jubilees, with [[Bunting (textile)|bunting]] dressing the street, and children playing in the street. An estimated 10 million people took part in street parties in 1977 for the Queen's [[Silver Jubilee]].

The tradition seems to have begun mainly in England and Wales after [[World War I]] as residents' own "peace teas" to celebrate the signing of the [[Treaty of Versailles]] in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.streetparty.org.uk/history.aspx |title=History of Street Parties |publisher=Streets Alive Ltd. |accessdate=2017-06-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The tradition was boosted for the [[Wedding of Prince William of Wales and Kate Middleton|wedding of Prince William and Kate Middleton]] in April 2011 with about 1 million people joining in street parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetparty.org.uk/royal-wedding-street-parties.aspx |title=Street Parties for the Royal Wedding 2011 |publisher=Streetparty.org.uk |date=2011-04-29 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; For the [[Diamond Jubilee of Elizabeth II|Queen's Diamond Jubilee]] in June 2012 about 2 million took part.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.streetparty.org.uk/queens-jubilee-street-parties.aspx |title=Street Parties for the Queen's Diamond Jubilee 2012 |publisher=Streetparty.org.uk |date=2012-06-05 |accessdate=2013-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Now street parties are held annually and at any time for residents to meet their neighbours in a traffic-free street in a private street party. Some "street parties" are public events taking many forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-12979666 |title=Royal wedding: Why so few street parties? |first=Katie |last=Fraser |date=2011-04-06 |accessdate=2017-06-21 |publisher=[[BBC News]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An application needs making to the local authority to close a road for a street party.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.wrexham.gov.uk/assets/pdfs/year_of_culture/application_street_party.pdf|title=Application for Closure under Town Police Clauses Act 1847|last=Wrexham County Borough Council|first=|date=2018|website=Wrexham County Borough Council|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=19 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite the age of the legislation, any order made by the local authority uses the [[Town Police Clauses Act 1847]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.deeside.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/05/may-races-closure-notice-v7_50b7fa4fdc.pdf|title=Town Police Clauses Act 1847.

[[File:Mifflin Street Block Party.png|thumb|right|People and police officers at a very large block party]]
[[File:OakFoodAndDrums.JPG|thumb|right|Musicians performing at a block party]]
Block parties are reported as a [[World War I]] innovation originating from the East Side of [[New York City]], where an entire block was roped off and patriotic songs sung and a parade held to honor the members of that block who had gone off to war.&lt;ref&gt;"Block Parties", [[The Outlook (New York)|The Outlook]], 16 October 1918; reviewed 2008-09-20.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fiocco v. Carver, 234 NY 219 (1922)&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, many inner city block parties were actually held illegally, because they did not file for an event permit from the local authorities. However, police turned a blind eye to them.

In the [[United States]], block parties usually occur on holidays such as [[Independence Day (United States)|Independence Day]] and [[Memorial Day]]. Some towns may also have an annual block party.

Block parties gained popularity in the United States during the 1970s, particularly within the [[hip hop culture|hip hop community]]. Block parties were often held outdoors and power for the DJ's [[Sound reinforcement system|sound system]] was taken illegally from street lights, as referenced in the song "South Bronx" by [[KRS-One]].

Sometimes the occasion may be a theme such as a recent popular movie or "Welcome to our town" for a new family. Often block parties involve barbecues and lawn games such as [[Simon Says]], [[karaoke]], and group dancing such as the [[Electric Slide]], the [[Macarena (song)|Macarena]] or [[line dancing]]. In many small towns, the local fire department may also participate in the party, bringing out trucks that they display for show.

Before and during [[World War II]], the [[Breton nationalism|Breton nationalist movements]] were generally associated with [[anti-French]] and the political right-wing.&lt;ref&gt;[[Michel Nicolas]], ''Histoire du mouvement breton'', Syros, 1982, p. 102 ; [[Alain Déniel]], p. 318 ; see also in the bibliography : [[Bertrand Frélaut]], [[Georges Cadiou]], [[Françoise Morvan]], [[Kristian Hamon]].&lt;/ref&gt; The extent to which this led to [[Collaboration with the Axis Powers during World War II|collaboration with the Nazi occupiers of France]] during the war, together with their motivations, is a matter of historical controversy.

== Background ==

Before the occupation,  [[Breton nationalist]]s were split between regionalism, federalism, and separatism.  Essentially these factions, though divided, remained insensitive and frankly hostile to democratic ideals.  Among these groups, only the openly separatist [[Breton National Party]] remained organized; dissolved in 1939, it was rapidly reconstituted in the autumn of 1940 and became the most active political party in Brittany under the Occupation{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.  Having broken in 1931 from regionalism, its founders ([[Olier Mordrel]] and [[François Debeauvais]]) were inspired by the Irish Revolution and played the nationalist card.  When war broke out, the [[Breton National Party]] chose a position of strict neutrality. This party's ideas were anti-democratic and complacent towards xenophobia and antisemitism, influenced by German racism and close to all the varieties of European fascism. During the war the activism of the Breton National Party completely dominated the other branches of the Breton movement, who found themselves discredited.

== Collaboration with the Vichy regime ==

On 15 December 1940 a "petition" signed by 46 Bretons requesting "administrative autonomy" in the confines of a united France was sent to [[Philippe Pétain]].  On 22 January 1941, the [[Vichy government]] named [[Hervé Budes de Guébriant]] President of the National Commission for Agricultural Cooperation.  The daily journal ''La Bretagne'' was created by Yann Fouéré on 21 March 1941.  It took a regionalist point of view, opposed to the separatism of the [[Breton National Party]].  An appreciable number of Breton nationalists were also to be found in the [[Consultative Committee of Brittany]], created on 11 October 1942 by [[Jean Quénette]], prefect of the region of Brittany.  "An organization of study and work", according to [[Yvonnig Gicquel]], it did not wield any executive or decisive powers (against the wishes of the provincial parliament which conceived the adoption of the Breton regionalist doctrine).  The will of its members (including members of the Breton National Party Yann Fouéré, [[Joseph Martray]], etc.) was to transform this consultative committee into a true legislative assembly to tackle regional problems.  Many of its members were to resurface when [[CELIB]] was created.

== Collaboration with Germany ==
[[File:L'Heure bretonne, journal hebdomadaire nationaliste breton.jpg|thumb|upright|''[[L'Heure Bretonne]]'', a collaborationist Breton newspaper of 1942]]

===German politics===
The work of [[Henri Fréville]] and [[Kristian Hamon]] have opened up this field for research. Three different periods can be considered.

Before 1939, Germany was trying to stop France and the United Kingdom from entering the war. During the [[phony war]], Germany planned to favor regionalist movements (particularly those of [[Flanders]] and Brittany) in order to undermine France. This was in revenge for the [[Treaty of Versailles]]. and to ensure that Germany remained the only Continental power, with no threats on its western border. Some weapons were delivered but never used. By the end of June and early July, some Breton nationalists could take it for granted the independence of Brittany was well on the way when the Germans appointed a military governor in Brittany ruling over the five départements of ancient Brittany.&lt;ref&gt;''de 1940 à 1941, Réapparition d'une Bretagne provisorement incomplète, un provisoire qui dure encore'', bulletin et mémoires de la Société Archéologique et historique d'Ille-et-Vilaine, t.CXIX  [[Etienne Maignen]], 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

But after the defeat of France a settlement was quickly made with the occupying power. The projects to undermine France were abandoned and the support for the nationalists disappeared (in particular it was formally forbidden to proclaim a Breton state or to harm public order).  Moreover, the formal annexation of Alsace-Lorraine was never proclaimed.  After the Conference of Montoire nationalist movements were simply tolerated (transport permits were given as well as authorizations for purchases of gasoline that soon meant little in practice), and German support went no further than preventing the Vichy regime from suppressing the nationalist movements.

====Ideology====
Bretons were not considered [[untermenschen]] (subhuman) by the Nazis, unlike the [[Jews]] and [[Romani people|Gypsies]] for example.&lt;ref name="Stone2009"&gt;{{cite book|author=David Stone|title=Hitler's Army, 1939-1945: The Men, Machines and Organization|year=2009|publisher=MBI Publishing Company|isbn=978-0-7603-3750-9|page=38}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NevidRathus2009"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Jeffrey S. Nevid|author2=Spencer A. Rathus|title=Psychology and the Challenges of Life|date=23 November 2009|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=978-0-470-38362-9|page=1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mordrel, Lainé and some other Celticists argued that the Bretons were a 'pure' strain of the Celtic race, who had retained their "[[nordicism|Nordic]]" qualities, a view consistent with Nazi Aryan [[master race]] ideology. Other Nationalists, such as Perrot, adopted a more conservative-Catholic stance consistent with longstanding Breton anti-radical ideologies that had emerged among the Royalist-Catholic "[[First White Terror|Whites]]" during the French Revolution.

====Strategic rationale====
A main intention of the German occupiers was to break French national unity. Its support for Breton nationalism needs to be seen in this wider context which included other aspects, for example the division of France into the occupied zone and the Vichy zone. But Breton nationalists very soon realized that Germany was in practice trying to keep its friends in the Vichy government content and therefore refusing to give any priority at all to the Breton nationalist demands.

Nazi scholar Rudolf Schlichting toured the region and sent the following comment to his superiors: "from a racial point of view there would be no objection to a [[Germanization]] of the Breton population. It is evident that we have no interest in promoting the Breton national consciousness, once the separation [with France] is accomplished. Not a penny should be spent on the promotion of the Breton language. The French language will however be replaced by German. In one generation Brittany will be a predominately (''sic'') German country. This goal is definitely attainable through the schools, the authorities, the army and the press."&lt;ref&gt;Hutton, C. (2002). Linguistics and the Third Reich: Mother-tongue Fascism, Race and the Science of Language, {{ISBN|0-203-02101-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Breton National Party===
Important members of the Breton National Party including [[Morvan Lebesque]] and [[Alan Heusaff]] began collaborating with the Germans to one degree or another. The example of Ireland, or even the ideal of an independent Brittany - continued to be their reference points. Recent studies have shown the close links that Breton separatist leaders such [[Célestin Lainé]] and [[Alan Louarn]] had with German military intelligence (the [[Abwehr]]), going back well before the war, to the 1920s. After the defeat of 1940, the Germans used these separatist agents in military operations or in repression against the Resistance. A short-lived breakaway faction of the Breton National Party, created in 1941, was the [[Mouvement Ouvrier Social-National Breton]] (Breton National-Socialist Workers Movement) led by [[Théophile Jeusset]].

==== Brezona ====
At the end of 1940, [[Job Loyant]] &amp;mdash; along with [[Kalondan]], [[André Lajat]], and [[Yves Favreul-Ronarc'h]], a former leader of the Breton National Party in [[Loire-Atlantique]] &amp;mdash; developed the doctrine of the [[Brezona]] movement: supremacy of the Breton race, formation of a national community, and government by the elite.  This movement was to have but a brief existence.  To prevent a possible takeover of the BNP by this splinter group, [[Yann Goulet]] appeared at [[Nantes]] to pronounce the excommunication of the Brezona "deviationists."  With his revolver in plain sight on the hip of the black uniform he wore as chief of the Youth Organizations, he left no doubt as to his intentions.  The Nantes PNB meeting, at which the Brezona movement had hoped to take control, took place without incident.

====Bezen Perrot====
{{Main|Bezen Perrot}}
A number of Breton nationalists choose to join the Bezen Perrot organization, a German militia led by [[Célestin Lainé]] and [[Alan Heusaff]].  As many as 70 to 80 people joined its ranks at one point or another, with typically 30 to 66 at any one time depending on recruiting and defection.  At the end of the war a handful of Breton militants decided to ask for German support in the face of the assassination of several leading figures of the Breton cultural movement, such as [[Jean-Marie Perrot|Abbé Perrot]].  Having originally been named ''Bezen Kadoudal'', the 1943 assassination of the priest prompted Lainé to give his name to the organization in December of that year.

It had already been envisaged by German strategists that in the event of Allied invasion the Breton nationalists would form a rearguard, and that further nationalist troops could be parachuted into Brittany.&lt;ref&gt;Daniel, A, ''Le Mouvement Breton'', p.303-06&lt;/ref&gt; In late 1943 sabotage dumps had been hidden for use by the militia.&lt;ref&gt;Biddiscombe, P. "The Last White Terror: the Maquis Blanc and its impact in liberated France, 1944-1945", in: ''The Journal of Modern History'', 2001, p. 834&lt;/ref&gt;

====Strolladoù Stourm====
The [[Strolladoù Stourm]] (also known as Bagadoù stourm), led by Yann Goulet and [[Alan Louarn]], was the armed wing of the Breton National Party.  A handful of their members took part in a confrontation with the population of [[Landivisiau]], on August 7, 1943. Yann Goulet, their leader, forbade participation in [[Bezen Perrot]].

====Landerneau Kommando====
By April 1943, the Gestapo had created specific units to combat the [[French Resistance]]. Formed at the end of April 1944 in [[Landerneau]], the Landerneau [[Kommando]] took part in these units.  It was composed of 18 German soldiers and ten French agents (some of whom were Breton separatists as well as former Resistance members). They fought against the [[maquis (World War II)|maquis]] (rural French Resistance units) of [[Trégarantec]], [[Rosnoën]], and [[Ploumordien]]. Several Resistance members were tortured, and the Kommando also summarily executed some prisoners.

==Actions by the Resistance==
[[File:Groupe-liberte-de-saint-nazaire.jpg|thumb|Breton resistors near [[Saint-Nazaire]] with the [[flag of Brittany]], probably photographed after the Liberation]]
Several Breton nationalists were assassinated by the Resistance in 1943. The best known was [[Jean-Marie Perrot|Abbé Perrot]], killed on 12 December 1943 by [[Jean Thépaut]], a member of the Communist Resistance. Earlier, on the 3 September, [[Yann Bricler]] had been shot in his office by three FTP members, and similarly [[Yves Kerhoas]] was killed by the Resistance when leaving a fete in the village of [[Plouvenez]]. When American troops arrived in 1944, communist ''maquis'' members began their repressive actions. [[Jeanne Coroller-Danio]], the Breton historian who worked under the name ''Danio'', was beaten to death along with her brother-in-law, Commander Le Minthier; the Tastevint brothers were [[castrated]],{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} and the Maubré sisters and their brother were savagely murdered in [[Morbihan]]{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

The BNP, dissolved along with the [[French Communist Party]] in 1939, no longer legally existed.  Its activists were hunted down and not distinguished from the Breton militants who wore the symbol of the dukes of Brittany ("ermine-trimmed berets").  Many were deported to detention camps; notably at the Camp Marguerite in Rennes where 150 nationalists were detained for alleged collaborationism.&lt;ref&gt;Biddiscombe, p. 835&lt;/ref&gt;  The Breton nationalists sought to defend the fact{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} that their widespread image as an overtly fascist, even Nazi, movement had nothing to do with the actual political backgrounds of their activists, as varied as the [[Action française]] (royalist), the [[French Section of the Workers' International]] (SFIO, socialist), the separatist [[Breton National Party]] (PAB), or the French Communist Party.  Moreover, Yann Goulet received financial and public backing from several communist militants at the time of the Liberation{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.  Other militants accused of collaboration demonstrated to the courts that they had protected Jewish families during the occupation ([[Alan Eon]]&amp;ndash;[[Yann Goulet]]){{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}.

== The nationalist movement after the liberation of France ==
After France was liberated, it was as collaborators, not as separatists, that the PNB members were punished, and even then it was by no means all those members that were affected. Only 15 to 16 per cent of PNB members appeared in court, and few non-member sympathisers were prosecuted. Most leading members escaped in Ireland or Germany and were not judged. There was no mass repression as claimed in post-war separatist propaganda. However the post-war nationalist movements will tend to minimise the collaboration with nazi Germany and will create the myth of the separatists repression by the French government.&lt;ref&gt;Ronan Calvez, ''La Radio en langue bretonne: Roparz Hemon et Pierre-Jakez Hélias : deux rêves de la Bretagne'', Presses universitaires de Rennes, 2000, 330 pages, p. 91  : "En réalité, à la Libération, au sein du mouvement breton, on minimise la collaboration, on crée le mythe de l'épuration sauvage"&lt;/ref&gt;

On the other hand, the standpoint of the Breton nationalists consider that the representation of the Breton nationalism during World War II in the media is a pretext to discredit the current aspirations of the autonomist movement, such as the recognition of linguistic rights.&lt;ref&gt;[http://esteurop.free.fr/artic13/reveil13.html Point de vue de L. Girard]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Involvement in the Resistance ==
Several leading Breton activists - regionalists, federalists and separatists - joined the Resistance against the occupation{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}}. They had various motivations:

===Sao Breiz===
As early as 1940 some joined ''[[Sao Breiz]]'', the Breton wing of the [[Free French]]. This included several members of the [[Union Régionaliste Bretonne]] (Breton Regionalist Union) and the ''[[Ar brezoneg er skol]]'' association, founded before the war by Yann Fouéré. M. de Cadenet, a member of the latter group, and some of his associates wrote a draft statute, presented to General [[Charles de Gaulle]] which would have given Brittany a number of political freedoms after the return of peace. According to Yann Fouéré, this plan was close in spirit to the one that the Breton Consultative Committee wanted to submit in 1943 to Marshal Pétain. Neither of these two plans resulted in anything.

===Joining underground organisations===
Activists like [[Francis Gourvil]], [[Youenn Souffes-Després]] and [[Jean Le Maho]] had before the war been members of minority separatist or federalist movements such as the [[Parti Autonomiste Breton]] (PAB) or the [[Ligue fédéraliste de Bretagne]]. These organisations were always clearly anti-fascist and critical of the extreme right. This led their members directly into the underground Resistance. Others joined the Resistance as individuals and after the war restarted their involvement in Breton nationalism. The action of a few members of [[Bezen Perrot]] has often concealed a very different reality, for example the members of [[Bagadou Stourm]] who founded the [[Forces Bretonnes de l'Intérieur]] (Breton Forces of the Interior, a Breton wing of de Gaulle's French Forces of the Interior), and were deported to [[Buchenwald]].

===Liberty Group===
For other groups, such as the Liberty Group of [[Saint-Nazaire]] (composed of young former members of [[Bagadoù stourm]]), pro-British feeling was the determining factor in pushing them to ally themselves with the Resistance.  The Liberty Group, under the name of ''Bataillon de la Poche'' ("Pocket Battalion"), helped to liberate Saint-Nazaire from a pocket of German holdouts in May 1945.

=== Breton nationalists linked to the London-based leadership of the Resistance ===
* The painter [[René-Yves Creston]], despite his involvement with ''[[L'Heure Bretonne]]'' (a Breton nationalist and antisemitic newspaper), was affiliated with the Resistance network of the [[Musée de l'Homme]]. He was engaged in reconnaissance work for the British. It seems that in October 1940, he received via [[Yann Fouéré]] a memo destined for London concerning Breton autonomy (to be continued by the [[Comité Consultatif de Bretagne]]), with a short preface specifying the origins of the "Breton question."
* In 1940, the overtly pro-Nazi [[Olier Mordrel]] covertly sent [[Hervé Le Helloco]] on a mission to England (via the channels of the Resistance) in order to convince the leadership of the Resistance of the "Allied leanings" of the Breton movement.  This effort went no further because of Helloco's track record, and the reaction of the Nazi-allied PNB.

'''Carpathian Germans''' ({{lang-de|Karpatendeutsche, Mantaken}}, {{lang-hu|kárpátnémetek}} or ''felvidéki németek'', {{lang-sk|karpatskí Nemci}}) are a group of [[ethnic Germans]]. The term was coined by the historian Raimund Friedrich Kaindl (1866–1930), originally generally referring to the German-speaking population of the area around the [[Carpathian Mountains]]: the [[Cisleithania]]n (Austrian) crown lands of [[Kingdom of Galicia and Lodomeria|Galicia]] and [[Bukovina]], as well as the [[Lands of the Crown of Saint Stephen|Hungarian]] half of the [[Austria-Hungary|Austro-Hungarian monarchy]] (including the [[Spiš|Zips]] region), [[Bosnia and Herzegovina in Austria-Hungary|Bosnia-Herzegovina]] and the northwestern ([[Maramuresch]]) region of [[Kingdom of Romania|Romania]]. Since the First World War, only the Germans of Slovakia (the '''Slovak Germans''' or ''Slowakeideutsche'', including the [[Zipser Germans]]) and those of [[Carpathian Ruthenia]] in [[Ukraine]] have commonly been called ''Carpathian Germans''.

==History==

===Kingdom of Hungary===
Germans settled in the northern territory of the medieval [[Kingdom of Hungary (1000–1538)|Kingdom of Hungary]] (then called [[Upper Hungary]], today mostly Slovakia) from the 12th to 15th centuries (''see [[Ostsiedlung]]''), mostly after the [[Mongol invasion of Europe]] in 1241. There were probably some isolated settlers in the area of [[Bratislava|Pressburg/Pozsony]] (Bratislava) earlier. The Germans were usually attracted by kings seeking specialists in various trades, such as craftsmen and miners. They usually settled in older Slavic market and mining settlements. Until approximately the 15th century, the ruling classes of most cities in present-day Slovakia consisted almost exclusively of Germans.
[[File:skkadepressburger1869.jpg|thumb|''Pressburger Zeitung'', 1869]]
[[File:skkadegrenzbote1891.jpg|thumb|''Westungarischer Grenzbote'', 1891]]
[[File:Nemci 1900.png|thumb|Carpathian Germans in 1900]]
The main settlement areas were in the vicinity of Pressburg and some language islands in the [[Spiš]] (Hungarian: ''Szepesség''; German: ''Zips''; {{lang-la|Scepusium}}) and the [[Hauerland]] regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |publisher=Museum of Carpathian German Culture (''Múzeum kultúry karpatských Nemcov'') |url=http://www.kdv.sk/muzeum.html |title=Karpatskí Nemci ("Carpathian Germans") |language=Slovak |date=n.d. |accessdate=2008-05-04 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080508031328/http://www.kdv.sk/muzeum.html |archivedate=2008-05-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The settlers in the Spiš region were known as ''Zipser Sachsen'' (Zipser [[Saxons]], Hungarian: ''cipszerek''). Within Carpathian Ruthenia, they initially settled around [[Teresva]] (Hungarian: ''Taracköz''; German: ''Theresiental'') and [[Mukachevo]] (Hungarian: ''Munkács''; German: ''Munkatsch'').

The Carpathian Germans, like the Slovaks, were subjected to [[Magyarization]] policies in the latter half of the 19th and the beginning of the 20th century. Furthermore, many Carpathian Germans voluntarily magyarized their names to climb the social and economic ladder.&lt;ref name="voluntary"&gt;[http://www.policy.hu/discus/messages/102/canek-czroma.pdf Policy.hu] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030520135505/http://www.policy.hu/discus/messages/102/canek-czroma.pdf |date=May 20, 2003 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 October 1918, the National Council of Carpathian Germans in [[Kežmarok]] (Hungarian: ''Késmárk''; German: ''Käsmark'') declared their loyalty to the Kingdom of Hungary, but a Slovak group declared Slovakia part of [[Czechoslovakia]] two days later.

===First Czechoslovak Republic===
During the First Czechoslovak Republic (1918–1938), Carpathian Germans had a specific political party, the [[Zipser German Party]] (1920–1938) of Andor Nitsch, who was elected from 1925 to 1935 on a common Hungarian-German list for parliamentary elections. In 1929, another party, more nationalist-oriented, was formed in Bratislava, the [[Carpathian German Party]] (KdP), which made a common list at the 1935 parliamentary elections with the [[Sudeten German Party]], whose leader [[Konrad Henlein]] became its head in 1937 with Franz Karmasin as deputy. In 1935, both parties obtained a seat in both parliamentary assemblies. In 1939, the KdP was renamed [[German Party (Slovakia)|German Party]] with [[Franz Karmasin]] as führer, who had become in October 1938 state secretary for German Affairs in the [[Slovak Republic (1939–1945)|Tiso government]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.gschweng.de/Limbach_Geschichte.htm# |title=Herta Brydon, Limbach - Geschichte und Brauchtum eines deutschsprachigen Dorfes in der Slowakei bis 1945, 1991 |access-date=2007-06-02 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070620040226/http://www.gschweng.de/Limbach_Geschichte.htm# |archive-date=2007-06-20 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Dr. Thomas Reimer, [http://www.carpathiangerman.com/history.htm Carpathian Germans history]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ondrej Pöss, Geschichte und Kultur der Karpatendeutschen, Slowakisches Nationalmuseum&amp;nbsp;— Museum der Kultur der Karpatendeutschen, Bratislava, Bratislava/Pressburg, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

The status of Slovak Republic as a client state of [[Nazi Germany]] during [[World War II]] made life difficult for Carpathian Germans at the war's end. Nearly all remaining Germans fled or were evacuated by the German authorities before the end of the war. Most Germans from Spiš evacuated to Germany or the [[Sudetenland]] before the arrival of the [[Red Army]]. This evacuation was mostly due to the initiative of [[Adalbert Wanhoff]] and the preparations of the diocese of the German [[Evangelical Church in Germany|Evangelical Church]], between mid-November 1944 and 21 January 1945. The Germans from Bratislava were evacuated in January and February 1945 after long delays, and those of the Hauerland fled at the end of March 1945. The Red Army reached Bratislava on 4 April 1945.

===After WWII===
After the end of the war, one third of the evacuated or fugitive Germans returned home to Slovakia. However, on 2 August 1945, they lost the rights of citizenship,&lt;ref&gt;[[Germans in Czechoslovakia (1918-1938)|Sudeten Germans]] in the border regions of the [[Czech lands]] and the Hungarians in the south of Slovakia also lost their citizenship&lt;/ref&gt; by [[Beneš decrees|Beneš decree]] no. 33, and they were interned in camps such as in Bratislava-Petržalka, [[Nováky]], and in Krickerhau [[Handlová]]. In 1946 and 1947, about 33,000 people were expelled from Slovakia under the [[Potsdam Agreement]], while around 20,000 persons were allowed/forced to remain in Slovakia because they were able, on petition, to use the "[[Slovakisation]]" process,&lt;ref name="voluntary" /&gt; which meant that they declared themselves as Slovaks and changed their names into their Slovak equivalent or simply Slovakized them.,&lt;ref name="voluntary" /&gt; while others were simply forced to do so because their skills were needed. Out of approximately 128,000 Germans in Slovakia in 1938, by 1947 only some 20,000 (15.6% of the pre-war total) remained. The citizenship consequences of the Beneš decrees were revoked in 1948, but not the expropriation. There were many massacres in 1944-45, such as that of 270 civilians from the Upper Zips and [[Dobšiná]], Carpathian Germans who had fled to Bohemia as refugees and intended to return home after the war.

==Today==
[[File:skkadeplaque.jpg|thumb|Memorial plaque commemorating expelled Carpathian Germans, Bratislava]]
[[File:Skkadeplaque2.jpg|thumb|left|Plate in the Slovak museum of German culture in Bratislava]]
According to national censuses, there were 6,108 (0.11%) Germans in Slovakia in 2007, 5,405 in 2001, 5,414 in 1991, and 2,918 in 1980. A Carpathian German Homeland Association has been created to maintain traditions,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.kdv.sk/ Karpatendeutscher Verein]&lt;/ref&gt; and since 2005 there is also a museum of the culture of Carpathian Germans in Bratislava.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.snm.sk/?about-the-museum-9 Museum of Carpathian German Culture]&lt;/ref&gt; There are two German-language media financially helped by the Slovak government, ''Karpatenblatt'' (monthly) and ''IKEJA news'' (Internet), plus minority broadcasting in German on the Slovak radio.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/minorities/3_FCNMdocs/PDF_2nd_SR_SlovakRepublic_en.pdf|title=Second report on the implementation of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities in the Slovak Republic|year=2005|accessdate=6 August 2011|location=Bratislava}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coe.int/t/dghl/monitoring/minorities/3_FCNMdocs/PDF_3rd_SR_SlovakRepublic_en.pdf|title=Third report on the implementation of the Framework Convention for the Protection of National Minorities in the Slovak Republic|date=May 2009|accessdate=6 August 2011|location=Bratislava}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, their countrymen, now living in Germany and Austria, founded cultural associations as well. There is also a Carpathian German Landsmannschaft of North America.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.karpatendeutsche.de/ Karpatendeutsche Landsmannschaft]&lt;/ref&gt;

Amongst prominent member ethnic Germans in post World War II Slovakia is [[Rudolf Schuster]], the second President of Slovakia (1999–2004).

The Carpathian and other German-speaking groups in Romania are currently represented by the [[Democratic Forum of Germans in Romania]] (DFDR).

===Language===
Due to the isolation of the German from countries where German has been standardized (Germany, Austria, and Switzerland), there are many obscure German dialects that still exist in Slovakia. Many of these dialects are in danger of extinction.

In the Upper and Lower [[Zips (region)|Zips regions]] (and later in Romania), the [[Zipser Germans]] spoke [[Zipser German|Zipserisch]]&lt;!--using the German name only to avoid "Zipser Germans spoke Zipser German"--&gt;. A community of speakers remains in [[Hopgarten]], speaking a distinctive dialect called "Outzäpsersch" (German: Altzipserisch, literally "Old Zipserish"). In Dobsina they spoke what they called Dobschauisch or Topschauisch. In Metzenseifen (Medzev) they spoke Mantak of which only a few dozen people speak it today. The German schools were closed after World War II in the all of the former German-speaking towns, and children were forcibly taught Slovak. German was not to be used in the workplace or even in the street.

'''Crime in Armenia''' is multi-dimensional. It includes [[murder]], [[tax evasion]], [[political corruption|corruption]], [[extortion]], [[money laundering]], [[police brutality]], [[organized crime]], and clan or gang violence.

In 2017 there were 20 284 criminal cases registered in Armenia, up from 18 764 in 2016.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.armstat.am/file/article/sv_12_17r_550.pdf|title=Criminal statistics for 2017 by ArmStat|last=|first=|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Crime by type ==
=== Murder ===
{{Further|List of countries by intentional homicide rate}}
In 2017 there were 49 cases of murder in Armenia (about 1.6 per 100,000 population), down from 66 in 2016.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;  Total of 409 persons died because of various criminal cases (down from 424 in 2016), including 202 cases of death because of crime leading to  road accident.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

In 2012, Armenia had a murder rate of 1.8 per 100,000 population.&lt;ref name="UNODC" /&gt; There were a total of 54 murders in Armenia in 2012.&lt;ref name="UNODC"&gt;[https://www.unodc.org/gsh/en/index.html ''Global Study on Homicide''.] [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]], 2013.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Organised crime  ===
Organized crime permeates the Armenian economy.  In Yerevan there are organized, criminal clans known as "akhperutyuns" ({{lang-hy|ախբերություն}}, or ''brotherhoods'').  They assert their power through their position and connections.  The various factions sometimes battle for rights over their "turf". The origins of akhperutyuns are criminal law and the tradition of Armenian family life (ojakh). Members are guided by the underworld laws brought from Russian prisons.&lt;ref name="MeanStreets"&gt;{{cite news |first=Vahan |last=Ishkhanyan  |coauthors= |title=Mean Streets: A rare look at Armenia’s Capital clans |work=ArmeniaNow |page= |date=March 3, 2006 |accessdate=June 30, 2009 |url=http://www.armenianow.com/?action=viewArticle&amp;IID=1071&amp;AID=1390&amp;lng=eng }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===  Corruption ===
{{Main|Corruption in Armenia}}

In 2017 634 corruption related criminal cases were registered, which led to criminal persecution of 376 persons.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[United Nations Development Programme]] in Armenia views corruption in Armenia as "a serious challenge to its development".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.undp.am/?page=Speeches&amp;id=9 "Strengthening Cooperation between the National Assembly, Civil Society and the Media in the Fight Against Corruption"], Speech by Ms. Consuelo Vidal, (UN RC / UNDP RR), April 6, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Domestic violence ===
A 2008 study by [[Amnesty International]] stated more than a quarter of women in [[Armenia]] "have faced physical violence at the hands of husbands or other family members."&lt;ref name="AmnestyIntl-Nov-13-2008"&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/news-and-updates/report/no-pride-silence-domestic-sexual-violence-against-women-armenia-20081113 ''There’s no pride in silence: domestic and sexual violence against women in Armenia''], [[Amnesty International]], November 13, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;  Since reporting domestic violence is heavily stigmatized in Armenian society, many of these women have no choice but to remain in abusive situations.&lt;ref name="AmnestyIntl-Nov-13-2008"/&gt;

=== Environment protection ===
In 2017 there were 885 cases of breaches of legislation on environment protection leading to total 3346 million AMD compensation demands.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

== By location ==
In 2017 there were 10219 criminal cases registered in Yerevan, about the half of all 20284 criminal cases in Armenia in 2017.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9189">[[Namibia]] is situated in sub-Saharan Africa, a region that has some of the highest crime rates in the world. Among other factors, this situation is contributed to by poverty, a low level of development, and enormous social and economic disadvantages.&lt;ref name=UNCrime&gt;{{citation

Organised crime across all of Southern Africa probably only developed in the 1980s. While the thousands of kilometers of unsecured borders are often believed to be responsible for enabling cross-border crime, "research has shown that criminals prefer legal border points".&lt;ref name=Hbschle&gt;{{cite news

==Types of crime==

===Crimes against the person===

====Serial killings====
Namibia has experienced at least one serial killings event when between 2005 and 2007 the [[B1 Butcher]] killed and dismembered five women and deposited body parts along Namibia's [[B1 road (Namibia)|National Road B1]]. The identity of the B1 Butcher was never conclusively determined.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====Violence====
Namibia has a high rate of domestic violence, particularly against women and children. Rape and murder cases are frequent. The number of rape cases reported annually was estimated to be between 700 and 1,600 in 2010, and domestic violence is primarily done by men against women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

A census in 2011&lt;ref name="The Namibian"&gt;{{cite web|title=Census gives snapshot of Namibia's population|url=https://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?id=106621&amp;page=archive-read|website=The Namibian|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that the Namibian population was 2 113 077, and the UN Drugs and Organised Crime Office counted the number of murders in 2012 at 388&lt;ref name="2014 Global Homicide Report, p. 124"&gt;{{cite web|last1=UNODC Statistics|title=2014 Global Homicide Report|url=https://www.unodc.org/documents/gsh/pdfs/2014_GLOBAL_HOMICIDE_BOOK_web.pdf|website=United Nations|publisher=UN Office for Drugs and Crime|accessdate=26 November 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; or 17.2 people per 100,000. This is relatively high compared to other African countries; for comparison, Guinea-Bissau had 140 murders or 8.4 per 100,000 people according to UN survey data.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

There are a number of non-profit organisations to counter gender-based violence but the problem is perceived to become worse. Former President [[Hifikepunye Pohamba]] suggested in 2014 that 6 March should become a national prayer day,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

====Infanticide====
There are a number of cases every year where newborn babies are dumped in river beds, in rubbish-bins and in dams. According to the report published by the parliamentary standing committee on human resources, social and community development, from 2003 to 2007, baby dumping rose from 6 to 23 cases per year, a 283 percent rise. Most of these cases of concealment of birth go unreported; Windhoek Water Works alone reported in 2008 that they discover 13 dead newborns in their waste water system per month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

===Property crimes===
====Money laundering====
[[Money laundering]] is legislated by the ''Financial Intelligence Act'' and controlled by the ''Financial Intelligence Centre''. The Centre reported a significant increase in suspicious transactions in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

}}&lt;/ref&gt; but already in 2003 the [[United Nations]] described the situation  as "critical".&lt;ref name=UNCrime/&gt;

====Stock theft====
{{main|Stock theft in Namibia}}

Stock theft is a prevalent crime in Namibia and carries hefty penalties. After a 2004 law amendment to the [[Stock Theft Act]], stealing livestock over the value of 500[[N$]] results in a 20-year (repeat offenders: 30 year) mandatory prison sentence. This clause has in 2011 been declared unconstitutional, but several people were sentenced until then.&lt;ref name=cut&gt;{{Cite news | title=Stock theft sentence cut by 17 years | last=Menges | first=Werner | newspaper=[[The Namibian]] | date=13 December 2011 | page=1 | url=https://www.namibian.com.na/index.php?id=89362&amp;page=archive-read}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dan art''' is created by the [[Dan people]] of [[Liberia]] and the [[Ivory Coast]].

==Masks==
{{Main|Dan masks}}

[[Masks]] are the most important art form of the [[Dan people]] of [[Liberia]].&lt;ref name="Johnson 1986"&gt;{{cite book|last=Johnson|first=Barbara C.|title=Four Dan sculptors : continuity and change|year=1986|publisher=Fine Arts Museums of San Francisco|location=San Francisco|isbn=088401049X}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are perceived to embody the most powerful of spirit forces, called ''ge ''or ''gle''.

==Feast Ladles==
The ''wunkirmian'' is a large ceremonial [[ladle (spoon)|ladle]] that is carved to honor a particular woman who has distinguished herself through generosity or hospitality. The ''wunkirmian'' is owned by the ''wunkirle'', who is considered the "most hospitable woman" of her village quarter. Traditionally, she chooses her own successor.

Curator Barbara C. Johnson describes the role of the feast ladle in a Dan feast: "At feast times [the wunkirle] marches with her spoon at the head of the line of women from her quarter. Each woman carries a pot of cooked rice or soup. The wunkirle either distributes to the food to the guests, or more frequently uses her ladle to indicate the distribution. At some feasts the wurkirlone of a village compete with each other in generosity by distributing small gifts of peanuts, candy, coins and other foods. The women dance at these times. The wunkirle's prestige may be indicated by her being carried in a hammock through the village by the women of her quarter. They also contribute gifts of their own, but always in the name of the wurkirle."&lt;ref name="Johnson 1986" /&gt;

Besides acting as "emblems of honor," feast ladles have spiritual power.&lt;ref name="Johnson 1986" /&gt; According to the Dan, the ladles embody ''[[Dan people#Religion|du]]'' and contain the power of the ''wunkirle''. The ''wunkirmiam'' is for the woman what the masks are for the men; ''wunkirmiam'' are the woman's chief liaison with the power of the spirit world and the symbol of that connection.&lt;ref name="Fischer and Himmelherber 1984"&gt;{{cite book|last=Fischer|first=Eberhard|title=The Arts of the Dan in West Africa|year=1984|publisher=Museum Reitberg|location=Zurich|author2=Hans Himmelherber}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like masks, each ''wunkirmian'' is given its own name.

The most common form of the wunkirmian has a handle carved as a human head that displays the characteristic of the ''buangle'' mask: narrow eyes and an oval face. The face on the ladle depicts a specific woman.

==Carved wooden heads on pedestals or staffs==
Janus-faced heads on a staff are reported to be carried by certain masked performers. The two faces looking in opposite directions symbolize the supernatural ability of the gle to see in all directions.&lt;ref name="Himmerheber 1960"&gt;{{cite book|last=Himmelheber|first=Hans|title=Negerkunst und Negerkunstler|year=1960|publisher=Klinkhardt &amp; Biermann|location=Braunscheweig}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like feast ladles, these heads are considered powerful spiritual objects that act as receptacles for ''du''. Some are created as portraits of deceased family members that embody that person's spirit.

==Brass Casting==
&lt;gallery mode=packed&gt;

&lt;/gallery&gt;
It is difficult to determine the antiquity of brass casting among the [[Dan people|Dan]], but it is clear that the practice began at least in the early 19th century if not much earlier. Some scholars believe that the We people to the East may have introduced the practice to the Dan.&lt;ref name="Schwab 1947"&gt;{{cite book|last=Schwab|first=George|title=Tribes of the Liberian Hinterland|year=1947|publisher=Papers of the Peabody Museum|location=Cambridge}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brass casting was a practice of Dan blacksmiths. In Dan communities, the blacksmith was always awarded a high status because he was responsible for agricultural tools and weapons.&lt;ref name="Johnson 1986" /&gt; Brass-casting took place at night to protect the object from onlookers. Brass-casters created brass objects using the cire-perdue, or [[lost wax method]].

By the late 1930s, a Liberian government decree outlawing all brass jewelry resulted in an abundance of brass, which brass-casters used to figurative sculptures. Typically, figures stand at about 8 inches tall and carry objects of cultural importance in their hands. The figures were made principally as prestige items.

{{distinguish|History of feminism}}
{{Feminism sidebar |history}}

'''Feminist history''' refers to the re-reading of history from a female [[perspective (cognitive)|perspective]].  It is not the same as the [[history of feminism]], which outlines the origins and evolution of the [[feminist movement]].  It also differs from [[women's history]], which focuses on the role of women in historical events.  The goal of feminist history is to explore and illuminate the female viewpoint of history through rediscovery of female writers, artists, philosophers, etc., in order to recover and demonstrate the significance of women's voices and choices in the past.&lt;ref name=Cain1994&gt;Cain, William E., ed. ''Making Feminist History: The Literary Scholarship of Sandra M. Gilbert and Susan Gubar'' (Garland Publications, 1994)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Laslitt1997&gt;Laslitt, Barbara, Ruth-Ellen B. Joeres, Mary Jo Maynes, Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, and Jeanne Barker-Nunn, ed. ''History and Theory: Feminist Research, Debates, Contestations'' (University of Chicago Press, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Lerner1981&gt;Lerner, Gerda, ''The Majority Finds Its Past: Placing Women in History'' (Oxford University Press, 1981)&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist History seeks to change the nature of history to include gender into all aspects of historical analysis, while also looking through a critical feminist lens. Jill Matthews states “the purpose of that change is political: to challenge the practices of the historical discipline that have belittled and oppressed women, and to create practices that allow women an autonomy and space for self-definition”&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Matthews|first=Jill|date=1986|title=Feminist History|url=https://doi.org/10.2307/27508788|journal=Labour History|volume=|issue=50|pages=147–153|doi=10.2307/27508788|jstor=27508788}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two particular problems which feminist history attempts to address are the exclusion of women from the historical and [[philosophy|philosophical tradition]], and the negative characterization of women or the feminine therein; however, feminist history is not solely concerned with issues of [[gender]] ''per se'', but rather with the reinterpretation of history in a more [[holistic]] and balanced manner. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If we take feminism to be that cast of mind that insists that the differences and inequalities between the sexes are the result of historical processes and are not blindly "natural," we can understand why feminist history has always had a dual mission—on the one hand to recover the lives, experiences, and mentalities of women from the condescension and obscurity in which they have been so unnaturally placed, and on the other to reexamine and rewrite the entire historical narrative to reveal the construction and workings of gender." —[[Susan Pedersen (historian)|Susan Pedersen]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historians.org/perspectives/issues/2000/0010/0010vie1.cfm|title=Pedersen, Susan. "The Future of Feminist History"|publisher=|accessdate=6 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The "disappearing woman" has been a focus of attention of academic feminist scholarship.  Research into women's history and literature reveals a rich heritage of neglected culture.&lt;ref&gt;Spender, Dale. Invisible woman: The schooling scandal. Writers &amp; Readers. London 1982&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Spender, Dale. Women of ideas - and what men have done to them from Aphra Behn to Adrienne Rich. Routledge &amp; Kegan Paul. London 1982&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the major issues with the history of feminism is its inability to address the concept of intersectionality. Jill Matthews states “The new feminist history emerged almost 20 years ago as an arm of the Women's Liberation Movement, or second wave feminism, and it continues to serve that political process”.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Understanding Feminist History==
Feminist history combines the search for past female scholars with a modern feminist perspective on how history is affected by them. While many mistake it as women's history, feminist history does not solely focus on the retelling of history from a woman's perspective. Rather, it is interpreting history with a feminist frame of mind. It is also not to be confused with the history of feminism, which recounts the history of the feminist movements. Feminist historians, instead, include “cultural and social investigations” in the job description.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; Feminist history came into being as women began writing accounts of their own and other women's lives. A few of these, such as [[Susan B. Anthony]] and [[Audre Lorde]], documented histories of their feminist movements.

Feminist historians collect to analyze and analyze to connect. Rather than just recording women's history, they allow a connection to be made with “public history."&lt;ref name="jstor.org"&gt;{{Cite journal

}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, problems remain in integrating this improved history into a curriculum appropriate for students. Finally, feminist historians must now be able to understand the digital humanities involved in creating an online database of their primary sources as well as published works done by notable feminist historians. Feminist digital humanists work with feminist historians to reveal an online integration of the two histories. Harvard's [http://guides.library.harvard.edu/content.php?pid=57201&amp;sid=419685 Women’s Studies Database] contain sources, like the Gerritsen Collection, that allow scholarly papers by feminists to be written and publicly convey the fact that there is more than one history and the progress made in combining them.

==Relations to Women's History==
Feminist historians use women's history to explore the different voices of past women. This gathering of information requires the help of experts who have dedicated their lives to this pursuit. It provides historians with primary sources that are vital to the integration of histories. Firsthand accounts, like Fiedler's And the Walls Come Tumbling Down? (A Feminist View from East Berlin) recounts the daily lives of past women. It documents how their lives were affected by the laws of their government. Women's historians go on to interpret how the laws changed these women's lives, but feminist historians rely on this information to observe the ‘disappearing woman’. Fieldler even mentioned that “[t]hese feminists were disappointed when they meant ordinary eastern women who were good housewives too, while enjoying outside work."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=And the Walls Come Tumbling Down? A Feminist View from East Berlin |author=Soja Fiedler |journal=Alternatives: Global, Local, Political |volume=18 |issue=1|date=Winter 1993 |pages=97–108 |jstor=40644766}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because these feminists only knew the public history of the [[German Democratic Republic]], they projected themselves into the imaginary.

Upon investigation of eastern women's lives, they found that though the GDR's socialist policies encouraged women in the labor force, there had been no women creating these policies. Once again, the patriarch had created a public history in which women were cut out. The discovery of neglected cultural accounts, similar to Fiedler's, has allowed women's historians to create large databases, available to feminist historians, out of them. These sources are analyzed by the historians to compare them to scholarly works published during the same time period. Finding works that are within the same time period isn't too difficult, but the challenge is in knowing how to combine what they learned from the source with what they know from the works.

==Integrating Histories==
Feminist historians see mainly two specific histories. The first is the public, singular history. It is composed of political events and newspapers. The second is made up of women's history and analyzed primary sources. The integration of these two histories helps historians to look at the past with a more feminist lens, the way feminist historians do. Professor Peter G. Filene of the University of North Carolina recounted in his paper Integrating Women's History and Regular History that “[his] purpose is to help students understand the values and behavior of people who are unlike themselves. Through history we enter other lives, analyze the forces that shaped those lives, and ultimately understand patterns of culture."&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; In fact, when Filene was asked to teach a course on the history of American women, the revelations of past women allowed him to recognize that he wasn't learning heroine history, or herstory, but a compensatory history. However, this thought limited his studies. He found himself thinking of women's contributions to what men had already written down. Rather than having the histories of the ‘public’ and the ‘domestic’ sphere, one should know that this line between the two is imaginary.

Though not all women are politicians or war generals, boys are raised in the [[Separate spheres|domestic sphere]]. Not only that, but men come back to it every day in their private homes. Even President [[Theodore Roosevelt]] can be quoted to say “[n]o man can be a good citizen who is not a good husband and a good father.”&lt;ref name="jstor.org"/&gt; Similar to how history needs domestic history incorporated into it, men's history cannot be understood without their private experiences known. Women's history thus needs their private experiences to be combined with their public. To successfully integrate these histories, the world must not have male and female spheres that are synonyms for the private and public. The connections found in public and private men's and women's history need to be systematically synthesized to successfully integrate them. So the idea of just two histories creates the challenge that most feminist historians have.

== Feminist historiography ==
Feminist historiography is another notable facet of feminist history. One important feminist historiography writer and researcher is [[Judith M. Bennett]]'''.''' In her book, ''History Matters: Patriarchy and the Challenge of Feminism'', Bennett writes on the importance of studying a “patriarchal equilibrium”.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=History Matters: Patriarchy and the Challenge of Feminism|last=Bennett|first=Judith|publisher=|year=2009|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cheryl Glenn also writes on the importance of feminist historiography “Writing women (or any other traditionally disenfranchised group) into the history of rhetoric, then, can be an ethically and intellectually responsible gesture that disrupts those frozen memories in order to address silences, challenge absences, and assert women's contributions to public life”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Glenn|first=Cheryl|date=2000|title=Truth, Lies, and Method: Revisiting Feminist Historiography|url=https://doi.org/10.2307/378937|journal=College English|volume=62|issue=3|pages=387–389|via=|doi=10.2307/378937|jstor=378937}}&lt;/ref&gt; This facet of feminist history inspect historical writings that are typically assumed to be canon, and reinvents them under a feminist lens.

The '''Hanlin Academy''' was an academic and administrative institution founded in the eighth-century [[Tang dynasty|Tang China]] by [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Emperor Xuanzong]] in [[Chang'an]].

Membership in the academy was confined to an elite group of scholars, who performed secretarial and literary tasks for the court. One of its main duties was to decide on an interpretation of the [[Chinese classics]]. This formed the basis of the [[Imperial examination]]s, which aspiring bureaucrats had to pass to attain higher level posts. Painters working for the court were also attached to the academy.

When the [[Qing dynasty]] revived the Ming ''Siyiguan'' 四夷館, the [[Manchu people|Manchus]], who "were sensitive to references to barbarians", changed the name from ''yi'' 夷 "barbarian" to ''yi'' 彝 "[[Yi people]]", and changed the [[Shan language|Shan]] [[exonym]] from ''Baiyi'' 百夷 "hundred barbarians" to ''Baiyi'' 百譯 "hundred translations".&lt;ref&gt;Wild (1945), p. 620.&lt;/ref&gt;

The later [[Tongwen Guan]] set up by the Qing dynasty for translating western languages was subordinated to the [[Zongli Yamen]] and not the Hanlin.

==1900 fire==
[[File:Hanlin Academy cropped.jpg|thumb|The Hanlin Academy in 1744, after a renovation under the [[Qianlong Emperor]]]]
The Beijing Hanlin Academy and its library were severely damaged in a fire during the [[Boxer Rebellion|siege of the Foreign Legations]] in [[Beijing]] in 1900 by the [[Kansu Braves]] while fighting against the [[Eight-Nation Alliance]]. On June 24, the fire spread to the Academy:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7232">'''Infrastructure security''' is the [[security]] provided to protect [[infrastructure]], especially [[critical infrastructure]], such as [[airport]]s, [[highway]]s &lt;ref&gt;http://www.tsa.gov/travelers/highway/index.shtm&lt;/ref&gt; [[rail transport]], [[hospital]]s, [[bridge]]s, [[transport hub]]s, network communications, [[Media (communication)|media]], the [[Grid (electricity)|electricity grid]], [[dam]]s, [[power plant]]s, [[seaport]]s, [[Oil refinery|oil refineries]], and [[water system]]s. Infrastructure security seeks to limit vulnerability of these structures and systems to [[sabotage]], [[terrorism]], and [[contamination]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.tsa.gov/who_we_are/index.shtm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-12-07 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081216161520/http://www.tsa.gov/who_we_are/index.shtm |archivedate=2008-12-16 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critical infrastructures naturally utilize information technology as this capability has become more and more available. As a result, they have become highly interconnected, and interdependent. Intrusions and disruptions in one infrastructure might provoke unexpected failures to others. How to handle
interdependencies becomes an important problem.&lt;ref name=electrical-defense/&gt;

The most recent example of vulnerable infrastructure was the electrical grid in 2003, when Northeastern American areas experienced a [[Northeast Blackout of 2003|power outage]] that appears to have originated in the Midwest, and possibly from a tree branch.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/blohm_r/NYTimes130504.htm/&amp;date=2009-10-25+13:43:27&lt;/ref&gt;

==Potential causes of infrastructure failure==
Critical infrastructure is vital for essential functioning of a country. Incidental or deliberate damage will have serious impact on the economy as well as providing essential services to the communities it serves. There are a number of reasons why infrastructure needs to be heavily secured and protected.

* [[Terrorism]] - person or groups deliberately targeting critical infrastructure for political gain. In the [[November 2008 Mumbai attacks]], the Mumbai central station and hospital were deliberately targeted.
* [[Sabotage]] - person or groups such as ex-employee, political groups against governments, environmental groups in defense of environment. Refer to [[People's Alliance for Democracy#Seizure of Suvarnabhumi International Airport|Bangkok's International Airport Seized by Protestors]].
* [[Information warfare]] - private person hacking for private gain or countries initiating attacks to glean information and also damage a country's infrastructure. For example, in [[2007 cyberattacks on Estonia|cyberattacks on Estonia]] and [[cyberattacks during the 2008 South Ossetia war]].
* [[Natural disaster]] - hurricane or natural events which damage critical infrastructure such as oil pipelines, water and power grids. See [[Hurricane Ike#Oil and gas spills|Hurricane Ike]] and [[Economic effects of Hurricane Katrina]].

==Security challenges for the electricity infrastructure==
One of the fundamental foundations of modern society is the electrical power systems. An intentional disruption of electricity supplies would affect national security, the economy, and every person's life. Because power grids and their sources are widely dispersed, this is a challenge for the effectiveness of defensive organizations and structures.&lt;ref name="elec-infra"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Massoud|first=Amin|date=April 2002|title=Security Challenges for the Electricity Infrastructure (Supplement to Computer Magazine)|journal=Computer|publisher=IEEE computer society|volume=35|issue=4|pages=8|doi=10.1109/MC.2002.10042}}&lt;!--| accessdate =2009-11-07--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Sabotage can damage electrical sources for the power grid, including civilian nuclear power stations. Sabotage in the form of cyberattacks can create havoc with computer, communication,  and information systems, which could severely interrupt the electrical supply. This in turn can cause major disruptions to other infrastructure components of society. Comprehensive defense plans are proposed.&lt;ref name=electrical-defense&gt;{{Cite journal

One method is to isolate load systems. Sophisticated defense systems should be
wide-area, real-time protection, with control systems that are alerted and guided by sensing technologies. Communication and information must be capably routed.&lt;ref name=electrical-defense/&gt;

==Remedies==

Many countries have initiated government agencies to directly manage the security of critical infrastructure usually through the Ministry of Interior/Home Affairs, dedicated security agencies to protect facilities such as [[United States Federal Protective Service]] and also creation of dedicated transport police such as the [[British Transport Police]]. There are also commercial transportation security units such as the [[Amtrak Police]] in the United States.

A number of government organizations has focus on infrastructure security and protection.  The Technical Support Working Group has the [http://www.tswg.gov/tswg/ip/ip_ma.htm Infrastructure Protection Subgroup]. The UK has the [[National Infrastructure Security Co-ordination Centre]].

Several infrastructures also use fiber optic perimeter intrusion detection security systems, which enables the detection and location of intrusions over many miles of deployed fiber. This is commonly used at water utility sites&lt;ref name="Future Fibre Technologies Inc and Unlimited Technology Inc announce a major perimeter security upgrade program for 24 pennsylvania based water utility sites "&gt;[https://www.forbes.com/feeds/prnewswire/2010/04/21/prnewswire201004212111PR_NEWS_USPR_____NY91268.html Future Fibre Technologies Inc and Unlimited Technology Inc announce a major perimeter security upgrade program for 24 pennsylvania based water utility sites ], Forbes.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="15591">'''Kim Timby''' (born 1970 in California, United States) is a [[History of photography|photography historian]] based in Paris who teaches at the [[École du Louvre]] and works as a curator for a private collection specialising international nineteenth-century photography. From her research and teaching, Timby writes on the cultural history of photography as a technology.

== Education ==
Timby’s research draws on her learning, and combines her interests, in [[anthropology]], history and photography. Her early experience of the medium was through her maternal grandmother, who had a darkroom and was active in her local photo club and showed her how to print in the darkroom. Her first camera was a high school graduation gift.

Timby was educated at the private [[Connecticut College]], [[New London, Connecticut|New London]], where as an Anthropology undergraduate she undertook a minor subject studio arts, studying photography and making photographs in the vintage processes of [[cyanotype]] and [[gum printing]]. From there she  graduated with a Bachelor of Arts in [[Social anthropology|Social Anthropology]] in 1992 before completing an M.A. in that discipline in 1996 at the [[École des hautes études en sciences sociales|École des Hautes Études en Sciences Sociales]], [[France]], and from 2002–2006 undertook her PhD at the same [[Paris]] institution.

== Career ==
Timby’s Master's thesis was "La photographie et l'ethnologie de la France. Modes d'emploi et apports de l'image" (‘Photography and the ethnology of France. Uses and contributions of the image’) dealing with the usefulness of photography to museums of French [[ethnography]] and how photography was employed by anthropologists in their [[Field research|field work]] and publications in studying French culture or as object of study in its own right. This research shifted her interest from traditional anthropology toward history, taking her into the [[history of photography]], where her anthropology guides her consideration of its cultural impact.

Timby’s research subsequent to her master's degree and her interest in photographic technologies and their social utility and impact stem also from her work as a [[curator]]. From 1996 to 2001 she was employed in that role at the [[Carnavalet Museum|Musée Carnavalet]], the museum of the history of Paris, a city so closely associated with the progress of photography from its invention.

There she prepared exhibitions including "Paris in 3D: from Stereoscopy to Virtual Reality, 1850-2000”, an exercise in configuring rigorous academic archival research for general consumption.

Timby had first become interested in [[Stereoscopy|stereography]] when working with the photography historian [[Peter E. Palmquist|Peter Palmquist]] for a month in the early 1990s as an undergraduate in the US. His study of original photographs and primary source materials to uncover overlooked aspects of the history of photography chimed with her background in anthropology and as an historian. Palmquist took her to an antique shop in [[Arcata, California|Arcata]] (California) where he lived, and there she bought her first stereo view.

Timby was able to find temporary work that engaged her interest in photography and anthropology at the [[Musée de l'Homme|Musée de l’Homme]] photography department and Musée Carnavalet specialising in the history of Paris. In 1996 she began co-curating a 3D exhibition at the Carnavalet museum, and the resultant display opened in Paris in October 2000 and closed January 2001. The exhibition and catalogue&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author1=Reynaud, Francoise | author2=Tambrun, Catherine | author3=Timby, Kim | author4=Musıe Carnavalet | title=Paris in 3D : from stereoscope to virtual reality, 1850-2000 | publication-date=2000 | publisher=Booth Clibborn Editions | isbn=978-1-86154-162-8 }}&lt;/ref&gt; in English and in French ( “Paris en 3D: de la stéréoscopie à la réalité virtuelle, 1850-2000”) in hardbound editions, appealed to a diverse audience who, using the different stereo viewers enclosed in the book, could enjoy hundreds of images, stereo pairs, [[Anaglyph 3D|anaglyphs]], [[Lenticular printing|lenticular]] images and [[Holography|holograms]], of Parisian life from the early nineteenth century to the present. Timby contributed text that one reviewer&lt;ref&gt;Rulien, Diane E. "Paris in 3D: From the Stereoscope to Virtual Reality 1850-2000." PSA Journal, vol. 67, no. 3, 2001, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;  called an ‘historical roadmap of the techniques leading to the development of 3D photography from stereocards, anaglyphs, and holograms to 3D computer imagery and [[virtual reality]]’. The book and exhibition were of ‘landmark’ historical value, in the opinion of another reviewer,&lt;ref&gt;Britt Salvesen, Curator and Department Head of the Wallis Annenberg Photography Department, Prints and Drawings Department, at the Los Angeles County Museum of Art,  ‘A Deep Look at Lenticulars’, in the National Stereoscopic Association (U.S.) journal Stereo world. Columbus, Ohio. March/April 2016. 18-19&lt;/ref&gt; with many of its pictures showing antique equipment and portraits of pioneers of stereoscopy and integrated biographical information and excerpts of treatises of prominent persons in stereoscopy. In the opinion of David Haberstich, the exhibition was ‘definitive’ in dealing with perception, art, and technology.&lt;ref&gt;“There will be other exhibitions dealing with stereoscopy and virtual reality, given the importance of the subject, but it is difficult to imagine anything similarly definitive and of comparable diversity and magnitude. If the exhibition 'Paris en 3D' was essentially about perception, art, and technology, rather than about documenting the history of a city, nevertheless its concentration on Paris provided a unique and rational focus. The catalogue serves as a permanent surrogate and constitutes a landmark study in this specialized area of the history of photography, with profound implications for future discourse about photographic vision.” David Haberstich (2001) in Book Reviews, History of Photography, 25:4, 392-396, DOI: 10.1080/03087298.2001.10443243&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2001, with a training and research grant from the Ministry of Culture and Communication (photographic patrimony) for access to patents, and by the Carnavalet museum as part of her work on the exhibition "Paris in 3D: de stereoscopy to virtual reality, 1850-2000 ", Timby published a 23-page academic paper on research into commercial, advertising, entertainment, and even medical and religious, applications of the lenticular image invention in France, and its technical development.&lt;ref&gt;Kim Timby, ‘Images en relief et images changeantes. La photographie à réseau ligné’, Études photographiques, no. 9, May 2001, p. 124-147&lt;/ref&gt;

== Investigation into 3D and colour photography ==
When researching 3D imaging Timby found that [[Color photography|colour]] was a major consideration, a thread that developed during her PhD on lenticular photography, begun after "Paris in 3D" closed and she had left Carnavalet. Her first published work on colour was the 2005 article "Colour Photography and Stereoscopy: Parallel Histories," from she developed the idea that colour, like 3D, was a constructed illusion; an ambition in common of the two technologies was the reproduction of an aspect of [[Perception|human perception]] through its [[deconstruction]] and reconstruction.”&lt;ref&gt;Kim Timby. ‘Colour Photography and Stereoscopy: Parallel Histories’, History of Photography, vol. 29, n" 2. Summer 2005, p. 183-196.&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 2005, before the completion in 2006 of her PhD at the Paris École des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales (EHESS), Timby was appointed Director of Collections at the Musée [[Nicéphore Niépce]] in [[Chalon-sur-Saône]], France which houses the archive of devices and objects once belonging to the inventor of photography as well as nearly three million images from all photographic processes.

There, her work included curating "Sous un beau ciel bleu: un siècle de couleurs et de photographie" (June 17–October 1, 2006), augmenting the second strand of her research interests, colour photography, into the technological, [[Aesthetics|aesthetic]], and social history which she has since pursued investigations alongside stereoscopy.  Timby’s other projects at the Musée Nicéphore Niépce included designing and implementing new permanent exhibition spaces structured around a rotating series of mini-exhibits, thus continuing her informed engagement with a wide audience.

Timby elaborates a cultural history of photography by examining human engagement with, and transformation of, its particular techniques and technologies, as she does with the [[Photo booth|photo-booth]], precursor to the ‘[[Selfie stick|selfie-stick]]’, in her paper “Photographies d’amitié. De l’usage collectif du photomaton,” (‘Photographs of friendships: the collective use of the photo booth’). For the same purpose, she tracks the mid-century development of colour printing technologies for magazine photographs as a response to audiences’ and advertisers’ desire, and the adaptation of photographers, amateur and professional, to its availability and special demands.

== Researching animated photography ==
In a move to alma mater École des Hautes Etudes en Sciences Sociales in 2009, and until 2012, Timby co-coordinated investigation in "La Création Photographique", a research program in the history of photography funded by the [[Agence nationale de la recherche|Agence Nationale de la Recherche]].

During this period she published a chapter 'Le cinéma dans une seule photo' : le portrait animé des années 1910’, a contribution to a collection of essays on the crossover between cinema and the still image,&lt;ref&gt;Guido, L., &amp; Lugon, O. (2010). Fixe-animé: Croisements de la photographie et du cinéma au XXe siécle. Paris: L'Age d'Homme.&lt;/ref&gt; also reproduced as ‘Cinema in a Single Photo: The Animated Screen Portrait of the 1910s’ in an English edition.&lt;ref&gt;Guido, L., &amp; Lugon, O. (2012). Between still and moving images: Photography and cinema in the 20th century. London: John Libbey Publishing.&lt;/ref&gt; Her text first raises the way that lenticular [[animation]], in novelty portraits and advertising, satisfied an expectation of progress toward ever more perceptual [[Realism (arts)|naturalism]] in photographic technologies, and this was expanded in the second chapter of her book ''3D and Animated Lenticular Photography: Between Utopia and Entertainment'', published in 2015.

Response to the book was positive and recognised the value of Timby’s contribution to the literature on lenticular imagery which in comparison to the history and analysis of other 3D technologies had received little attention.&lt;ref&gt;reviewed by Jan Baetens, ''[[Leonardo (journal)|Leonardo]]'', October 2016 [https://www.leonardo.info/review/2016/10/review-of-3d-and-animated-lenticular-photography-between-utopia-and-entertainment]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Britt Salvesen,  ‘A Deep Look at Lenticulars’ in the National Stereoscopic Association (U.S.) journal Stereo world.

In ''Lettre mensuelle du Stéréo-Club Français'' Octobre 2015, n°984. p.19&lt;/ref&gt;

== Teaching ==
Alongside the research affiliation with the EHESS where she was also in charge of a postgraduate seminar, Timby was a professor at the [[Paris College of Art]] from January 2010 to the end of 2012 and is currently, since 2005, professor responsible for the [[École du Louvre]]'s intensive 3-year History of Photography survey course.&lt;ref&gt;Laureline Meizel. ”Images à la sauvette” et papiers gras ou pourquoi et comment se salir les doigts.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6101">The '''Kofyar''' are a population in central [[Nigeria]] numbering around 50,000. After several anthropological studies, they provide{{citation needed|date=May 2016}} good illustrations of how colonial authorities become unwittingly enmeshed in local politics; of sustainable subsistence agricultural production in crowded areas; of successful self-directed development of market-oriented agriculture; and of the use of "traditional" cultural resources to prosper in modern Nigeria.

==Colonial history==

The population known as the Kofyar actually comprises three different "tribes" as designated by British colonial officers: the Doemak (or Dimmuk), Merniang, and Kwalla. However the three groups have a common [[Kofyar language|language]], economic pattern, and origin myth, and had formed into a union called the [[Koffyer Federation]] in the 1940s; they have therefore been referred to as a single group by anthropologists.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Glenn Davis 1996  ''Settlement Ecology: The Social and Spatial Organization of Kofyar Agriculture''.  University of Arizona Press, Tucson&lt;/ref&gt;

When first encountered by early British colonial authorities, they lived in the rugged hills in the southeastern corner of the [[Jos Plateau]] and in settlements around the plateau base.  Their subjugation by the British was largely non-violent until 1930, when a young Assistant District Officer named Barlow was killed in the hill village of Latok by a rock thrown at his head. After this the residents of Latok and neighboring villages were forced out of the hills and made to live on the plains below for nine years.  In an award-winning study, anthropologist Robert Netting explained how Barlow had been unknowingly used in a local political dispute.&lt;ref&gt;Netting, Robert McC. 1987 "Clashing Cultures, Clashing Symbols: Histories and Meanings of the Latok War".  ''Ethnohistory'' 34(4):352–380&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture and agriculture in the Kofyar homeland==

Robert Netting began anthropological research with the Kofyar in the early 1960s.  In the Kofyar homeland population densities were high, approaching 500/km² in many areas.  Netting's primary focus was on the Kofyar ecological adaptations, including the highly intensive agriculture being practiced and also the social institutions that were instrumental to sustainability.  Much of the land was in annual cultivation, with animal herds providing dung compost for fertilizer, and steep hillsides were intricately terraced. Netting's ''Hill Farmers of Nigeria'',&lt;ref&gt;Netting, Robert McC. 1968 ''Hill Farmers of Nigeria: Cultural Ecology of the Kofyar of the Jos Plateau''. Univ. of Washington Press, Seattle&lt;/ref&gt; a classic book in the field of [[cultural ecology]], showed how social institutions such as household form and land tenure had adjusted to the intensive cultivation system. Netting compared adaptations of Kofyar and their neighbors to demonstrate [[Ester Boserup]]'s&lt;ref&gt;Boserup, Ester. 1965. ''The Conditions of Agricultural Growth: The Economics of Agrarin Change under Population Pressure''. Aldine, Chicago.&lt;/ref&gt; thesis that agricultural intensification relates to the growth of increasingly dense population and decreasing per capita land area. Kofyar families farmed most intensively close to their homesteads while using less intensive bush and forest fallow systems, which required less investment, on more distant fields. Netting also observed that the Kofyar demonstrated a reversion to less labor-intensive long-fallow systems when land became available on the plains south of their traditional region. He further developed these ideas and placed the Kofyar within a much broader comparative context in his ''Smallholders, Householders''.&lt;ref&gt;Netting, Robert Mc. 1993. ''Smallholders, Householders: Farm Families and the Ecology of Intensive, Sustainable Agriculture''. Stanford University Press, Stanford&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economic and cultural change since the 1960s==

During the 1950s, the Kofyar began to settle in the fertile plains of the [[Benue Valley]] to the south of the Jos Plateau. Pioneering farms there used extensive [[slash and burn|slash-and-burn]] methods, but with rising population density and market stimulus, intensive methods were gradually introduced. By the 1980s, Benue Valley Kofyar were producing considerable surpluses of [[yam (vegetable)|yams]], [[rice]], [[peanut]]s, [[pearl millet]] and [[sorghum]] using labor-intensive but generally sustainable methods&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Glenn Davis, Robert McC. Netting and M. Priscilla Stone 1990 Seasonality, "Labor Scheduling and Agricultural Intensification in the Nigerian Savanna". ''American Anthropologist'' 92:7–23&lt;/ref&gt; – an interesting contrast to the externally supported agricultural development schemes in the region, which have generally failed.

As in the homeland, millet beer was found to play a key role not only in daily life&lt;ref&gt;Netting, Robert Mc. 1964 "Beer as a locus of value among the West African Kofyar". ''American Anthropologist'' 66: 375-384&lt;/ref&gt; but in the organization of agricultural production.  The highly productive farming system ran almost entirely on human labor, with little external inputs, and a key strategy for mobilizing local labor was the "mar muos", a festive labor party at which all workers were served generous amounts of millet beer.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Glenn Davis, Robert McC. Netting and M. Priscilla Stone 1990 "Seasonality, Labor Scheduling and Agricultural Intensification in the Nigerian Savanna". ''American Anthropologist'' 92:7–23&lt;/ref&gt;

Although most Kofyars now live in the Benue Valley (or in cities), the Jos Plateau homeland is still inhabited largely because of the Kofyars' efforts to maintain it as a cultural and economic resource.  Many Kofyar who live elsewhere still keep secondary homes in the homeland.&lt;ref&gt;Stone, Glenn Davis 1998 "Keeping the Home Fires Burning: The Changed Nature of Householding in the Kofyar Homeland". ''Human Ecology'' 26:239–265&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''labour revolt''' or '''worker's uprising''' is a period [[civil unrest]] characterised by strong [[Labour movement|labour]] militancy and strike activity. The history of labour revolts often provides the historical basis for many advocates of [[marxism]], [[communism]], [[socialism]] and [[anarchism]], with many instances occurring across the world in both the 19th and 20th centuries.

==Labour revolts in France==
The [[Canut Revolts]] in Lyons, France were the first clearly defined worker uprising of the Industrial Revolution.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The First occurred in November 1831 and was followed by later revolts in 1834 and 1848. Following the closure of the national workshops after the 1848 revolution in Paris, there was an uprising in Paris involving 100,000 insurgents involved in a three-day battle with the army, volunteers and reserve forces.

The [[Paris Commune]] in France (1871) is hailed by both anarchists and Socialists as the first assumption of power by the working class,{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} but controversy of the policies implemented in the Commune helped the split between the two groups.

==Labour revolts in the United States==
The [[Great Railroad Strike of 1877]] and the [[1877 Shamokin Uprising]] occurred in the United States.

The [[Battle of Blair Mountain]] in Logan County, West Virginia, USA (1921) was the largest organised armed uprising in American Labour History, and had a major impact on labour legislation in the United States.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Labour revolts in Russia, Germany and Eastern Europe==
The [[Revolution of 1905]] in led to the creation of the [[Saint Petersburg Soviet]] or worker's council which became the model for most Communist Revolutionary Activity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} The Soviet was revived in the [[Russian Revolution]] and the model was repeated in the [[German Revolution of 1918–19]], The [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]] and the [[Hungarian Soviet Republic]].

Some revolutionary activity within the Eastern Bloc resembled Labour Revolts, such as the [[Uprising of 1953 in East Germany]], the [[Hungarian Revolution of 1956]], the [[Polish 1970 protests]] although many communists would dispute this as 'Counter-Revolutionary' activity.{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Labour revolts in Great Britain==
A [[Red Clydeside]] was a period of labour and political militancy in the city of Glasgow, Scotland between the 1910s and the 1930s. Most famously, this resulted in raising the red flag in the [[Battle of George Square]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}}

==Labour revolts in Spain==
*The [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934]]

==Labour revolts elsewhere==
Some observers claimed that the [[protests of 1968]] were part of a "revolutionary wave",{{Citation needed|date=August 2009}} with much of the activity motivated by students.

== History ==

During Mir Abdullah Khan Wai's rule Sardar Kakkar Khan haibatzai Lehri Baloch lost his life in [[Bibi Nani]] whilst fighting the [[Kalhora]] tribe from Kachhi. The [[Kalhora]] were forced to leave Kachhi when a retaliatory attack was launched on them by a collection of Baloch tribes&lt;ref name="Baloch"/&gt;&lt;ref name="A" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V06_284.gif Balochistan - The Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 6, p. 278]&lt;/ref&gt;

Sardar [[Mir Jahangir Khan Lehri Baloch]] actively assisted the [[Khan of Kalat]] (Mir Khudaidad Khan) in controlling rebels in Kadh region of Mastung and lost his life in the process. After his death Sardar [[Mir Dost Mohammad Khan Lehri]] supervised the tribe until his decease in the year 1905. Sardar [[Mir Dost Mohammad Lehri]] was succeeded by Sardar [[Mir Mohammad Bahram Khan]] who was well loved and respected by the Lehris as well as [[Baloch people|Baloch]] from other tribes.&lt;ref name="Baloch"/&gt;

In the past, the Lehris were mostly land owners; agriculture being the main means of their livelihoods.&lt;ref&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V22_105.gif Sarawān - The Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 22, p. 99.]&lt;/ref&gt; They have an estimated population of about 400,000 in [[Balochistan (Pakistan)|Balochistan]].

This is a list of the world's '''longest wooden ships'''. The vessels are sorted by ship length including [[bowsprit]], if known.

Finding the world's longest wooden ship is not straightforward since there are several contenders, depending on which definitions are used. For example, some of these ships benefited from substantial iron or even steel components since the flexing of wood members can lead to significant leaking as the wood members become longer. Some of these ships were not very seaworthy, and a few sank either immediately after launch or soon thereafter. Some of the more recent large ships were never able or intended to leave their berths, and function as floating museums. Finally, not all of the claims to the title of the world's longest wooden ship are credible or verifiable.

A further problem is that especially wooden ships have more than one "length". The most used measure in length for registering a ship is the "length of the topmost deck" – the "length on deck" (LOD) – 'measured from leading edge of stem post to trailing edge of stern post on deck level' or the "length between perpendiculars" (LPP, LBP) – 'measured from leading edge of stem post to trailing edge of stern post in the construction waterline (CWL)'. In this method of measuring bowsprit including [[jibboom]] and out-board part of spanker boom if any have both no effect on the ship's length. The longest length for comparing ships, the total "[[Length overall|overall]]" length (LOA) based on sparred length, should be given if known.

The longest wooden ship ever built, the six-masted New England gaff schooner ''Wyoming'', had a "total length" of {{convert|137|m|ft}} (measured from tip of jib boom (30 metres) to tip of spanker boom (27 metres) and a "length on deck" of {{convert|107|m|ft|abbr=on}}. The {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}}-difference is due to her extremely long jib boom of {{convert|30|m|ft|abbr=on}} her out-board length being {{convert|27|m|ft|abbr=on}}.

At the time of its construction, it was the largest ferryboat ever built. Unlike its later sister, the ''Contra Costa'' which had a steel hull, the wooden-hulled ''Solano'' had tall masts in the center of mass ("hogposts") anchoring several wires ("guys") that strengthened the hull against the weight of the trains.&lt;ref&gt;Trimble, P.C. &amp; Knorp, W.

===International courts===
There are a number of international courts that are the highest courts of appeal for members of the [[Organisation of Eastern Caribbean States]] (OECS), [[European Union]] (EU), and some of the countries of the [[Commonwealth of Nations]] respectively. However, the members of those organisations do sometimes have high courts of their own and their jurisdiction may be limited: for example the EU's court of justice can only interpret EU law and treaties, domestic cases cannot be appealed.

[[File:El-matrimonio-romano.jpg|thumb|Statue depiction of Ancient Roman ''Matrimonium'']]

'''Manus''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|m|eɪ|n|ə|s}}; {{IPA-la|ˈmanʊs|lang}}) was an [[Ancient Roman]] type of [[Marriage in ancient Rome|marriage]],&lt;ref name="Gardner"&gt;Jane F. Gardner,''Women in Roman Law and Society'',First Midland Book Edition, 1991, 11&lt;/ref&gt; of which there were two forms: '''cum manu''' and '''sine manu'''.&lt;ref name="John"/&gt; In a cum manu marriage, the wife was placed under the legal control of the husband.&lt;ref name="Gardner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="John"/&gt; In a sine manu marriage, the wife was still under the legal control of her father.&lt;ref name="Colish"&gt;Marcia L. Colish,''The Stoic Tradition from Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages'', Brill Academic Publishers, 1990, 2 Edition, 383&lt;/ref&gt; 

In both cum manu and sine manu marriages, if both the husband and wife were ''[[Status in Roman legal system|alieni iuris]]'' (persons under ''[[patria potestas]]'', that is, under the power of his or her family's ''[[pater familias]]'') the marriage could only take place with the approval of both of the ''[[Pater familias|patres familias]]''.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt; However, the creation and termination of the marriage somewhat depended on the type of marriage.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt; 

Initially cum manu was the only form of marriage but in time the cum manu union faded and only sine manu marriage was widely practiced.&lt;ref name="Van"&gt;Rena Van den Bergh, "The Role of Education in the Social and Legal Position of Women in Roman Society", 11&lt;/ref&gt;

==Cum manu==
In a '''cum manu''' union the wife legally and [[ritually]] became a member of her husband's [[family]].&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt; She stood under the control of the husband’s ''[[potestas]]''&lt;ref name="Gardner"/&gt; or that of his father, and was thus no longer under the control of her father.&lt;ref name="Gardner"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Judith P. Hallett and Thoman Van Nortwick,''Compromising Traditions'',Routledge, 1997, 34&lt;/ref&gt; This change of status was referred to as ''[[Capitus Diminutio|capitis deminutio minima]]'',&lt;ref name="Susan"&gt;Susan Treggiari,''Roman Marriage: Iusti Coniuges'',Oxford University Press, 1993, 28&lt;/ref&gt; and the wife received the title of ''[[Mater familias|materfamilias]]'', meaning “mother of the household” - a title reserved for a woman in a cum manu union.&lt;ref name="Susan"/&gt; Legally the wife was [[Adoption|"adopted"]] by her husband and assumed the status of a daughter in the family.&lt;ref name="Gardner"/&gt; This granted her the same entitlements as the other children in the family over matters of [[intestate succession]].&lt;ref name="Gardner"/&gt; Therefore, the wife no longer [[Inheritance|inherited]] from her father but from her husband.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt; However, the husband held a limited power over her in comparison to his children.&lt;ref name="Gardner"/&gt; For example, the husband did not have the legal right of ''life and death'' the way he would his daughter, or that of ''[[noxal surrender]]'' and ''[[sales|sale]]''.&lt;ref name="Gardner"/&gt; 

The wife in a cum manu marriage held no proprietary capacity meaning she could not own any [[property]].&lt;ref name="Gardner"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt; Everything acquired prior to cum manu was thus transferred into the husband's property or that of his ''[[Pater familias|paterfamilias]]''.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt; During [[Cicero|Cicero's]] time property such as [[dowry]] was recognized as distinguishable and therefore recoverable.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt; [[Liability (financial accounting)|Liabilities]] the wife may have acquired before marriage were erased.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt; 

A [[widowed]] or [[divorced]] woman would become ''[[sui iuris]]''.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt; For a widowed wife two significant benefits came from cum manu marriage: the husband could grant the wife the ability to select her [[Women's rights|tutor]] and she was able to create a [[Will (law)|will]].&lt;ref name="Gardner12"&gt;Jane F. Gardner,''Women in Roman Law and Society'',First Midland Book Edition, 1991, 12&lt;/ref&gt; 

Cum manu (i.e. the woman enters into manus) was procured by one of three ways: '''[[Confarreatio]]''', '''Coemptio''' and '''Usus'''.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt;[[File:August Pio-Clementino Inv259.jpg|thumb|Roman high priests often associated with ''Confarreatio'' ceremony]]

===Confarreatio===
The ritual of '''[[confarreatio]]''' was one way of obtaining cum manu marriage and was available only to [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]].&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt; This is a particular kind of [[sacrifice]] made to [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]].&lt;ref name="Evans"&gt;Judith Evans Grubbs,''Women and the law in the Roman Empire: a sourcebook on marriage, divorce and widowhood'', 2002 by Rouledge, 22
&lt;/ref&gt; During this [[ritual]] the [[bridegroom]] and bride shared a bread made of ''farreus'' known as [[Emmer|emmer grain]], hence confarreatio translates to “sharing of emmer bread.”&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; This process required the presence of ten [[witnesses]] and the [[recital]] of ceremonial [[sacred]] [[Verse (poetry)|verses]].&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; High [[priests]] such as the priests of [[Jupiter (mythology)|Jupiter]], [[Mars (mythology)|Mars]], and [[Quirinus]] were required to be born from a confarreatio union and were otherwise unqualified to obtain [[priesthood]].&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; 

As confarreatio slowly fell from favor it became difficult to find [[candidates]] for priesthood.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Susan23"&gt;Susan Treggiari,''Roman Marriage: Iusti Coniuges'',Oxford University Press, 1993, 23&lt;/ref&gt; In order to revive confarreatio marriages, the practice endured some [[amendments]].&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Consequently, the ''[[Flamen Dialis|flamen Dialis’s]]'' wife only fell under the control of her husband during rituals, and was otherwise as autonomous as other women.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; Cum manu was no longer acquired by the employment of confarretio and became restricted to [[Patrician (ancient Rome)|patricians]] pursuing priestly positions.&lt;ref name="Susan24"&gt;Susan Treggiari,''Roman Marriage: Iusti Coniuges'',Oxford University Press, 1993, 24&lt;/ref&gt;

===Coemptio===
The matrimonial process of '''coemptio''' was in essence a [[Legal fiction|fictitious]] notional sale of the woman to the husband.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Gardner12"/&gt; Coemptio occurred at any time throughout marriage.&lt;ref name="Susan24"/&gt; This was a process of mancipation.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; The transaction occurred with a [[Weighing scale|scales]]-holder and in the presence of at least five [[witnesses]], all of whom were adult male Roman [[citizens]].&lt;ref name="Susan24"/&gt;

Coemptio could occur not only with a husband but also with an outsider.&lt;ref name="Susan24"/&gt; However, this process is deemed for the “sake of trust” not for the “sake of marriage.”&lt;ref name="Susan24"/&gt; Coemptio was only a convenient legal practice.&lt;ref name="Susan24"/&gt;  If a wife, who had become cum manu through the process of coemptio, [[divorced]], she became [[emancipated]].&lt;ref name="Susan"/&gt; By the 2nd century AD, a wife was able to compel her husband to [[emancipate]] her, a right not shared by her children.&lt;ref name="Susan24"/&gt; Coemptio was presumably a rare practice even during the 2nd century BC under [[Gaius Gracchus|Gaius]].&lt;ref name="Gardner12"/&gt; In addition, it was possibly the remains of earlier practices of notional sale.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt;

===Usus===
A cum manu acquired by '''usus''' was simply the [[cohabitation]] of the husband and wife for the duration of a year.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt; After a year passed the wife was transferred into the ownership of her partner, she was considered taken by the [[decree]] of yearly possession.&lt;ref name="Gardner13"&gt;Jane F. Gardner,''Women in Roman Law and Society'',First Midland Book Edition, 1991, 13&lt;/ref&gt; This process required no [[ceremonial]] practices.&lt;ref name="Gardner13"/&gt; 

If the woman was not willing to come into [[ownership]] of her husband, manus by usus was easily preventable.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; As conditioned in the [[Twelve Tables]] if the wife absented herself for the total of three days and three nights before the end of the year, each year, the marriage was not cum manu, and she was not under the ownership of her husband.&lt;ref name="Evans"/&gt; If a woman married cum manu through the process of usus later divorced, she became [[emancipated]].&lt;ref name="Susan"/&gt; Subsequently, the law of usus was dissolved by legal [[Coming into force|enactments]] presumably because it fell out of use.

==Sine manu==
In a '''sine manu''' union the wife legally and ritually remained a member of her father's family, standing under the control of her father's [[potestas]].&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt; A sine manu marriage did not change the legal status of the bride after the marriage, in regards to property rights.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John Peradotto and J.P. Sulliva,''Women in the Ancient World: The Arethus Papers'', State University of New York Press, 1984, 243&lt;/ref&gt; In other words, the [[bride]] is not under control of the husband.&lt;ref name="John"&gt;[[John William Smith (legal writer)|John William Smith]], John Innes Clark Hare, Horace Binny Wallace, John William Wallace,''A selection of leading cases, on various branches of the law'' Law Booksellers and Publishers, 1855, Volume 2, 409&lt;/ref&gt; This form of marriage held no ceremonial formalities led by a [[public official]].&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt; Ultimately it involved a husband and wife living together under the intention of a marriage, in conjunction with the legal capacity of marriage under the [[Roman law]].&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt; Although no official ceremony was held, it was [[customary]] for the bride to be escorted to her [[bridegroom]]'s house.&lt;ref name="Colish"/&gt; The children of this union were legally members of the husband’s [[agnatic]] [[Kinship|kin]].&lt;ref name="Susan32"&gt;Susan Treggiari,''Roman Marriage: Iusti Coniuges'',Oxford University Press, 1993, 32&lt;/ref&gt; They held no legal connection with the mother’s [[Pater familias|paterfamilias]], and could not make claims on her [[Intestacy|intestate]].&lt;ref name="Susan32"/&gt; 

It was only when the woman’s paterfamilias died that she became ''[[sui iuris]]''.&lt;ref name="Susan32"/&gt; This union allowed the wife to become independent sooner than cum manu, under the assumption that the fathers are likely to have died before a husband. Primarily this served the natal family, allowing her property to stay in the father’s possession.&lt;ref name="Evans21"&gt;Judith Evans Grubbs,''Women and the law in the Roman Empire: a sourcebook on marriage, divorce and widowhood'', 2002 by Rouledge, 21&lt;/ref&gt; 

Various factors may have led to the extinction of cum manu and the predominance of sine manu during the Roman Republic. Women faced with the loss of property when entering a cum manu marriage began to only [[consent]] to sine manu unions.&lt;ref name="Van"/&gt;

'''Mohammad Umer Daudzai''' ({{lang-ps|محمد عمر داودزی}} - born October 12, 1957) is a [[Politics of Afghanistan|Politician]] in [[Afghanistan]], most recently having served as the [[Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan)|Minister of Interior]] during the challenging [[Afghan presidential election, 2014|2014 electoral year]]. After a career with international non-governmental organizations including the [[United Nations Development Program]] in [[Geneva]], Daudzai started work as two term [[Chief of Staff]] of [[President of Afghanistan|Afghan President]] [[Hamid Karzai]] from 2003 to 2005 and then from 2007 to around 2010. From 2005 until 2007, President Karzai appointed him as Afghan [[Ambassador]] in [[Afghanistan–Iran relations|Iran]]. He then served as Afghan Ambassador to [[Afghanistan–Pakistan relations|Pakistan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/524228/omer-daudzai-emerges-as-strong-candidate-to-replace-karzai/|title=Omer Daudzai emerges as strong candidate to replace Karzai}}&lt;/ref&gt; tasked with advancing efforts to reach a political solutions to the war in Afghanistan. In September 2013, Daudzai was asked to serve as [[Ministry of the Interior (Afghanistan)|Afghan Minister of the Interior]] in [[Kabul]] and instead ensure security for the elections.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Khan |first=Tahir |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/524228/omer-daudzai-emerges-as-strong-candidate-to-replace-karzai/ |title=Omer Daudzai emerges as strong candidate to replace Karzai - The Express Tribune |publisher=Tribune.com.pk |date= |accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daudzai has left official office and continues to work in Afghanistan's politics through supporting youth groups, and mobilizing politically influentials people and organizations in support of strengthening the country's democratic order. He has also emerged as a critic of President [[Ashraf Ghani]]'s unbalanced regional diplomacy and pursuit of unilateral closeness to Pakistan—arguing in a NYT oped that "rather than expect a miraculous U-turn from Islamabad, Mr. Ghani’s government would do better to use its resources, and the international community’s continued support, to concentrate on its main purpose: consolidating the Afghan state."&lt;ref name="nytimes1"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2015/03/23/opinion/afghanistan-and-pakistan-the-false-promise-of-rapprochement.html]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;

==Early life and education==
Daudzai was born on 12 October 1957 in the [[Qarabagh District, Kabul|Qarabagh District]] of the [[Kabul Province]] in Afghanistan. He grew up and completed his primary education in his home district of Qarabagh. In order to continue his higher education, Omar moved to the capital city [[Kabul]].

==80s and 90s: Anti-Soviet Jihad and Association with Hezbi Islami==
During the 1980s Daudzai became active in the resistance against the [[Soviet–Afghan War|Soviet-occupation]] and joined the [[Mujahideen]] group of [[Gulbuddin Hekmatyar]]: [[Hezbi Islami]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/10/24/world/asia/24afghan.html?pagewanted=2&amp;_r=2 |title=Iran Is Said to Give Top Karzai Aide Cash by the Bagful (Page 2 of 2)|first=Dexter |last=Filkins |publisher=The New York Times|location=United States|date=October 23, 2010|accessdate=2010-10-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; While still influential with the former cadre of Hebi Islami who are active in Afghanistan's politics, Daudzai has ended his official ties with the party reportedly after the Soviet withdrawal in 1989 and remains politically independent.

==1996-2003: UN Employee==
During the Taliban era Daudzai decided to settle in [[Peshawar]], Pakistan, and began working for the organization [[Save the Children]]. While working there through a scholarship program, he was able to go to the [[Victoria University (United Kingdom)|Victoria University]] in the [[United Kingdom]] for his Masters in Science. After completing his Masters he came back to work for the Swedish Committee in [[Jalalabad]], Afghanistan. In 1996 he moved to [[Islamabad]], Pakistan, where he started working for the [[United Nations Development Program]] (UNDP). In 2001 he moved to [[Geneva]], [[Switzerland]], where he assumed the role of "Area Development Specialist" in UNDP Geneva.

==2003-2005: Afghan Chief of Staff==
In November 2003 Daudzai was approached by the [[Afghan Transitional Administration]] to assume the office of the Chief of Staff of the President and took the position. At that time, the key challenge was establishing the Afghan state amidst an environment full of traditional power holders and illegal militias. Commenting on how only few militias have disarmed, he said: "Any force not part of the Afghan National Army is a challenge, but this is reality, so we ought to deal with it diplomatically and peacefully. I hope we will succeed."&lt;ref name="Al-Ahram"&gt;[http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/699/in5.htm Al-Ahram Weekly: Waiting for Godot] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090910115117/http://weekly.ahram.org.eg/2004/699/in5.htm |date=September 10, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Daudzai served as Hamid Karzai's Chief of Staff until 2005&lt;ref name=NYT-2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2004/06/21/story23336867.asp |accessdate=September 4, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101027170444/http://archives.tcm.ie/irishexaminer/2004/06/21/story23336867.asp |archivedate=October 27, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; when he moved to [[Tehran]] as the [[Foreign relations of Afghanistan|Afghan Ambassador]] to [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.tehrantimes.com/PDF/10371/10371-16.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==2007-2011: Return as Chief of Staff==
In 2007, he replaced Jawed Ludin and resumed the position of the Chief of Staff for Afghan President Hamid Karzai.

===Peace Talks and the Taliban Imposer Episode===
In the summer of 2010, outside Daudzai's influence, Karzai sat down with a man believed to be former [[Taliban]] Cabinet minister [[Akhtar Muhammad Mansour]] to discuss peace between the Taliban and the Afghan Government. According to Daudzai, it later turned out the man wasn't Mansour at all, but an imposter who was just a shopkeeper in [[Quetta]]. Daudzai blamed the [[United Kingdom|British]] for this debacle, because he said that they brought the man in front of Karzai. "International partners should not get excited so quickly with those kinds of things," Daudzai said, adding that the incident shows that the Afghan peace talks should be "Afghan-led and fully Afghanized."&lt;ref name="cbcnews"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2010/11/26/world/main7092313.shtml |title=CBS: Afghans Blame British for Taliban Imposter |publisher=Cbsnews.com |date=2010-11-26 |accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wikileaks Cables Daudzai also believed that the [[Norway|Norwegian]]s might have been fooled into meeting self-proclaimed members of the Taliban who may in fact not have been Taliban members at all. Daudzai claimed that he had never heard anything about contact between the Taliban and Norwegian authorities.&lt;ref name="newsinenglish.no"&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://www.newsinenglish.no/2011/01/31/wikileaks-norway-talked-to-taliban/ |title=Aftenposten: WikiLeaks: Norway talked to Taliban |publisher=Newsinenglish.no |date=2011-01-31 |accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Atlantic profiled him as:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mujib Mashal is an Afghan writer based in Kabul. |url=https://www.theatlantic.com/international/archive/2014/06/the-men-who-run-afghanistan/373197/ |title=The Men Who Run Afghanistan |publisher=The Atlantic |date=2014-06-23 |accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; "A soft-spoken former aid worker, Daudzai served as the president’s liaison to the many warlords and strongmen he had to keep in check—both to ensure stability and to secure his reelection in 2009. While Daudzai was once associated with the conservative Hizb-e-Islami party, the 56-year-old...is more pragmatic in his worldview. When Karzai made an ultimately unsuccessful push for reconciliation with the Taliban in 2011, he dispatched Daudzai as his ambassador to Pakistan. To express his displeasure with the Americans, who tried to oust him during his 2009 reelection campaign, Karzai replaced Daudzai as chief of staff with Abdul Karim Khurram, a conservative former culture minister with an anti-American reputation."

===Cash Aid from Iran to Hamid Karzai's Office===
In 2010, there were rumors that then President Hamid Karzai's office was receiving bags filled with cash from Iranian officials.

Two weeks after the controversy about the Iranian money Daudzai came out to the Afghan Media for an open interview. In the interview Daudzai showed piles of files that proved that every cent of the money coming from Iran were spent on government expenses only and that he had record for all the money that came from Iran.

According to [[wikileaks cables]] Daudzai told deputy US ambassador Francis Ricciardone already in February 2010 that certain Afghan officials were on Tehran's payroll, including some people nominated for cabinet positions.

"'''Mr. Hankey's Christmas Classics'''" is the fifteenth episode of the [[South Park (season 3)|third season]] of the animated television series ''[[South Park]]''. An [[album]] of the same name consisting of versions of songs from the show as well as a number of additional songs was released the week prior to the episode's original air date, December 1, 1999.

==Reception==
In September 2008, Russian prosecutors filed a motion to ban the series based on complaints received about this episode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| title =Bid to ban "extremist" U.S. cartoon| url =https://www.reuters.com/article/oddlyEnoughNews/idUSL869731820080908|work =| publisher= [[Reuters]]|date = 2008-09-08|accessdate = 2008-10-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The TV station was allowed to keep its license by agreeing not to re-air the program.&lt;ref name="Dobson2012"&gt;{{cite book|last=Dobson|first=William J.|title=The Dictator's Learning Curve: Inside the Global Battle for Democracy|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YpK7opoaY6wC&amp;pg=PT171|accessdate=9 May 2015|date=2012-06-05|publisher=Knopf Doubleday Publishing Group|isbn=9780385533362|pages=171–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ted Gournelos]] called "Merry Fucking Christmas" as sung by Mr. Garrison, "ridiculously offensive".&lt;ref name="Gournelos2009"&gt;{{cite book|last=Gournelos|first=Ted|title=Popular Culture and the Future of Politics: Cultural Studies and the Tao of South Park|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=MSs2AAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA65|accessdate=9 May 2015|date=2009-09-30|publisher=Lexington Books|isbn=9780739137222|pages=65–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Episode ==

The episode is styled as a [[variety show]] and features [[Mr. Hankey]] as the host;&lt;ref name="ArianoBunting2006"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ariano|first1=Tara|last2=Bunting|first2=Sarah D.|title=Television Without Pity: 752 Things We Love to Hate (and Hate to Love) about TV|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cm28udLiQlkC&amp;pg=PA169|accessdate=9 May 2015|year=2006|publisher=Quirk Books|isbn=9781594741173|pages=169–}}&lt;/ref&gt; he sits by the fire in his sewer home and introduces shorts featuring unusual holiday songs. In a similar fashion to "[[Starvin' Marvin in Space]]", the episode was dedicated to [[Mary Kay Bergman]], the original voice of most of the female characters on the show up to that point, who had committed suicide less than a month earlier. Since the episode features audio from the ''Christmas Classics'' album, which had been recorded months earlier, it marks the final episode in which Bergman's voice is heard.

During the "Christmas Time in Hell" song Satan is singing along with various celebrities in Hell, including [[Jeffrey Dahmer]], [[John F. Kennedy]], [[John F. Kennedy, Jr.]], [[Diana, Princess of Wales]], [[Gene Siskel]], [[Mao Zedong]], [[Genghis Khan]], [[Michael Landon]] and [[Jimmy Stewart]]. A framed picture of comedian [[Andy Dick]] is also seen during the dance number.

=== "Fighting the frizzies, at eleven." ===
After every commercial break, a live action segment featuring a news anchor is shown, saying "Fighting the frizzies, at eleven." In the DVD commentary, Stone and Parker indicate this is a reference to a bootleg tape of ''[[Star Wars Holiday Special]]''. The original tape featured a brief clip at the end from [[WCBS-TV]] featuring newscaster [[Rolland Smith]] informing viewers, "Fighting the frizzies, at eleven." However, while the original news ad was apparently referring to "frizzy" hair, the ending credits of this episode of ''South Park'' feature the news anchor boxing a man in a giant fuzzy suit.&lt;ref&gt;''The Complete South Park Season 3'' DVD&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Muslim Khatris''' are religious converts  from [[Hindu]]  [[Khatri]] community. Khatri word in Punjabi is thought to be variant of kshatriya in Sanskrit. In western districts of the Punjab (Sargodha, Mianwali, [[Murree]], [[Attock]], Chakwal, [[Rawalpindi]] and [[Gujrat City|Gujrat]], [[Gujranwala]]), converted Khatri traders called themselves "Sheikh", a family title or surname which is carried on up to their current generations throughout Pakistani Punjab.

== History ==
Khatri's have an extensive military tradition and have excelled in the armed forces, having received many honors and gallantry awards for their service.khatri word is Punjabi version of kshatriya in Sanskrit or the warrior class.  Khatri's have sometimes expanded into agriculture. Although a large majority of Khatris are [[Muslims]]. The conversion started in 12th century. In western districts of the Punjab ([[Sargodha]], [[Mianwali]], [[Multan]], [[Jhang]], [[Chakwal]], [[Rawalpindi]],[[Eminabad]] and [[Faislabad]]) converted Khatri traders called themselves "Khoja". Some time they are called "Khoja Shaikh". With the advent of Islam following conquests by [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] tribes from [[Central Asia]] from the 11th century on wards, there were conversions of Hindus to the faith from among various Punjabi communities, including Khatris. Generally they retained their tribal and clan affiliations as has been the norm in the region. Similarly, the Khatris who converted to Islam continue to retain a strong social identity and are known as [[Punjabi Shaikh]].

== Khawaja Shaikh ==
{{Main|Khawaja Shaikh}}

Members of the Khatri caste, after converting to Islam, adopted the title Khawaja Shaikh ({{lang-ar|''' خواجہ شيخ'''}}) and to this community belong many prominent Muslim trading families of [[South Asia]].

== Qanungoh Shaikh ==
{{Main|Qanungoh Shaikh}}

Qanungoh Shaikhs ({{lang-fa|''' قانونگوہ شيخ'''}}) belonged to all the districts of the [[Punjab region|Punjab]]. They have different lineages and represent families who were holding hereditary office of ''Qanungoh'' ("law readers")  during the Muslim period.

This designation was used in the Punjab and other provinces of India and Pakistan for hereditary registrar of landed property in a subdivision of a district.

== Saudagaran-e-Delhi ==
{{Main|Punjabi Saudagaran-e-Delhi}}

In addition the Punjabi Saudagaran-e-Delhi community are also of Khatri ancestry. Historically, this community lived in [[Delhi]], and other north Indian towns, but after the [[Pakistan Movement|independence]] a lot of them moved to Pakistan. In Pakistan also the Muslim Khatris are expanded to various occupations.

'''No Bra Day''' is an annual observance on [[October 13]] on which women are encouraged to forgo wearing a [[bra]] as a means to encourage [[breast cancer]] awareness. No Bra Day was initially observed on July 9, 2011, but within three years it had moved to October 13, the month of [[National Breast Cancer Awareness Month]]. Users on social media are encouraged to post using the hashtag #nobraday to promote awareness of breast cancer symptoms and to encourage [[gender equality]]. Some users on social media sites also encourage women to post pictures of themselves not wearing a bra. Some women embrace No Bra Day as a political statement while others prefer the comfort of discarding what they view as a restrictive, uncomfortable garment.

The observance has spread worldwide. The event was spun off a medical event in Toronto, Canada, that encourages breast cancer survivors to consider [[reconstructive surgery]]. First held on October 19, 2011, the medical event was named BRA (Breast Reconstruction Awareness) Day. It was adapted by an anonymous individual who conceived of No Bra Day as a way to encourage women to enjoy being braless and to become knowledgeable about breast cancer symptoms. The day is controversial as some see it as sexualizing and exploiting women's bodies while at the same time belittling a serious disease.

== Origins ==

=== Event origins ===

The original event known as "BRA Day" was started by Toronto plastic surgeon Dr. Mitchell Brown. The first BRA Day event, titled "Breast Reconstruction – An Evening of Learning and Sharing", was held in Toronto, Canada at [[Women's College Hospital]] and [[Toronto General Hospital]] on October 19, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Closing the loop on breast cancer |url=http://www.womenscollegehospital.ca/news-and-events/connect/news/closing-the-loop-on-breast-cancer |publisher = Women's College Hospital| website=www.womenscollegehospital.ca |accessdate=September 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Brown found that many Canadian women who underwent a [[mastectomy]] due to breast cancer resisted undergoing [[reconstructive surgery]]. He founded "Breast Reconstruction Awareness" (BRA) Day to increase women's awareness of the availability of [[Breast reconstruction|reconstructive breast surgery]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Toronto BRA Day Event Program – Toronto Plastic Surgery |url=https://www.torontoplasticsurgery.com/toronto-bra-day-event-program/ |website=Toronto Plastic Surgery |accessdate=September 19, 2018 |date=October 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; BRA day is intended to raise awareness of [[breast cancer]] screening, alert women to breast cancer symptoms, and to encourage women to conduct regular self examinations. The event was adopted in the U.S. in 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National BRA Day |url=http://q961.com/the-history-of-the-bra-on-national-bra-day-photos/ |website=Q 96.1 |accessdate=September 19, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{asof|2018|9}}, the BRA Day event devoted to educating women about reconstructive surgery, and hosted by the [[Canadian Cancer Society]], continued to be held across Canada. BRA day is observed on different dates in different provinces of Canada during the month of October.&lt;ref name=ccs&gt;{{cite web |title=Canadian Cancer Society |url=http://www.cancer.ca/en/support-and-services/support-services/bra-day/?region=bc |website=www.cancer.ca |accessdate=September 19, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of No Bra Day can be traced back to the first BRA Day held in Toronto, in 2011. In July that year, an anonymous individual using the name Anastasia Doughnuts conceived of No Bra Day and published the first website promoting the event.&lt;ref name=anastasia/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=National No Bra Day |url=http://www.holidayscalendar.com/event/national-no-bra-day/ |website=Holidays Calendar |accessdate=September 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Happy National No Bra Day!

=== Cultural genesis ===

Women have protested the physical and cultural restrictions imposed by bras over many years. In 1966, during the height of the [[hippie]] era in San Francisco, two women students at [[San Francisco State University|San Francisco State College]] protested a proposed law that would require women to wear bras by walking topless near the campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=FALSE: Hillary Clinton Went Topless in the 1960s |url=https://www.snopes.com/fact-check/hillary-clinton-topless-1960s/ |website=Snopes.com |accessdate=September 21, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Nude Fine Art Print from San Francisco State College, 1966 at Wolfgang's |url=https://www.wolfgangs.com/photography/nude/fine-art-print/GAP0008.html |website=Wolfgang's |accessdate=September 21, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; On August 1, 1969, an Anti-Bra Day was declared in San Francisco to protest societal pressure to wear constrictive, feminine garments. The protest drew large crowds, blocking traffic, and a few women took their bras off from under their clothing in the Financial District.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://diva.sfsu.edu/collections/sfbatv/bundles/231116|title=Anti-Bra Protest in Downtown San Francisco – Bay Area Television Archive|website=diva.sfsu.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=svE1UqlqbWsC&amp;pg=PA139|title=All the People|first=Joy|last=Hakim|date=September 10, 2018|publisher=Oxford University Press|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1968, feminists organized [[Miss America protest|a protest]] at the [[Miss America Contest]] and tossed a number of feminine products in a garbage can. A newspaper headline erroneously stated that the women had burned their bras.&lt;ref name=boucher/&gt; That protest has been interpreted as a rejection of society's perception of women's bodies and dress requirements. During the 1970s women wore what they wanted without regard for political correctness. During the last two decades of the 20th century, bras expressed both professionalism and, due to the attention given a pink satin conical bra worn by [[Madonna (entertainer)|Madonna]], sexual freedom.&lt;ref name="weiss"/&gt;

=== Beginnings in social media ===

The first No Bra Day event was created by an anonymous internet user self-named "Anastasia Doughnuts" for July 9, 2011&lt;ref name=anastasia/&gt;&lt;ref name="weiss"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Weiss |first1=Piper |title=Today is National No Bra Day.

=== Feminist connection ===

Some participants connect not wearing a bra to feminist protests like those at the 1968 [[Miss America protest]]. There, protesters symbolically threw a number of feminine products including bras into a "Freedom Trash Can".&lt;ref name=dow&gt;{{cite journal|last=Dow|first=Bonnie J.|year=2003|title=Feminism, Miss America, and Media Mythology|url=http://www.public.asu.edu/~kleong/missamericacommodificationfeminist.pdf|journal=Rhetoric &amp; Public Affairs|volume=6|issue=1|pages=127–149|doi=10.1353/rap.2003.0028|issn=1094-8392|jstor=41939812|access-date=January 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; They described the items as "instruments of female torture"&lt;ref name="Duffett 1968, p. 4"&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Duffett |first=Judith |date=October 1968 |title=WLM vs. Miss America |work=Voice of the Women's Liberation Movement |page=4}}&lt;/ref&gt; and accouterments of what they perceived to be enforced [[femininity]]. The protest gained notoriety when a local news story in the Atlantic City ''Press'' erroneously reported that "the bras, girdles, falsies, curlers, and copies of popular women's magazines" were burned.&lt;ref name=boucher&gt;{{cite news|last=Boucher |first=John L. |title=Bra-Burners Blitz Boardwalk |work=Atlantic City Press |date=September 8, 1968}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Campbell|first=W.

Some feminists who support the idea of using No Bra Day to raise awareness of breast cancer are concerned with the sexualization of the #nobraday hashtag in social media.&lt;ref name="albala"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Albala |first1=Samantha |title=National No Bra Day: Is Everyone Missing The Point? |url=https://bust.com/tv/13140-national-no-bra-day-is-everyone-missing-the-point.html |website=bust.com |accessdate=September 21, 2018 |language=en-gb}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Philippines, the observance is seen as a day to advance the cause of [[gender equality]].

The tabloid website [[TMZ]] posted an item about "Happy No Bra Day" with an image of [[Selena Gomez]] wearing a see-through top.

Jean Sachs, CEO of Living Beyond Breast Cancer, thinks No Bra Day is offensive. "I mean breast cancer is a life-threatening illness. It has nothing to do with wearing a bra or not wearing a bra." Gayle Sulik, founder and executive director of the Breast Cancer Consortium, said, "But we don't really pay attention to what's going on with breast cancer. That's a hugely damaging impact of this sort of message".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Dupere |first1=Katie |title=#NoBraDay forgets that women are more than their boobies |url=https://mashable.com/2015/10/13/nobraday-breast-cancer/ |website=Mashable |accessdate=September 21, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In New Zealand, the New Zealand Breast Cancer Foundation attempted to repeat the success of a Scottish television breast cancer awareness campaign that educated women about the appearance of their breasts. It featured comedienne Elaine C. Smith showing pictures of typical breasts displaying cancer symptoms.&lt;ref name=drum&gt;{{cite web |title=Elaine C Smith stars in Scottish Government breast cancer campaign created by The Leith Agency |url=https://www.thedrum.com/news/2012/09/04/elaine-c-smith-stars-scottish-government-breast-cancer-campaign-created-leith-agency |website=The Drum |accessdate=September 23, 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; But New Zealand's Commercial Approval Bureau would have likely given the ad showing breasts and nipples for medical purposes an Adults Only classification, requiring it to be broadcast after 8:30 pm.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Bond |first1=Anthony |title=Images from advert responsible for 50% rise in women seeing GP about breast cancer BANNED in New Zealand |url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/world-news/images-advert-responsible-50-rise-2322952 |website=mirror |accessdate=September 23, 2018 |date=September 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Breast Cancer Foundation opted to place objects strategically in front of the nipples instead.&lt;ref name=drum/&gt;

=== Personal decision ===

One writer criticized the Facebook site's message "P.S. Ladies…. Wearing a white t-shirt on this day is not only acceptable, but encouraged!" as objectifying women's bodies. Some women resist the attempt to politicize their decision to not wear a bra or fetishize their breasts for a cause.&lt;ref name=care2/&gt; One woman commented, "The reason is that I tried being braless, and I liked it better. It wasn't a political decision, except insofar as everything a woman does with her body that isn't letting someone else dictate what she ought to do with it is a political decision".&lt;ref name= brenhouse&gt;{{cite web |last1=Brenhouse |first1=Hillary |title=The Joy of Not Wearing a Bra |url=https://www.newyorker.com/culture/personal-history/the-joy-of-not-wearing-a-bra |website=The New Yorker |accessdate=September 15, 2018 |date=October 26, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite |last1=Epstein |first1=Ben |title=Political Choice |website=Oxford Scholarship Online  |doi=10.1093/oso/9780190698980.003.0004 |date=April 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Franzevich Lesgaft''' ({{lang-ru|Пётр Францевич Лесгафт}}) (21 September 1837 &amp;ndash; 1909) was a [[Russia]]n [[teacher]], [[anatomist]], [[physician]] and social reformer. He was the founder of the modern system of physical education and medical-pedagogical control in physical training, one of founders of theoretical anatomy. [[Lesgaft National State University of Physical Education, Sport and Health]] in [[St. Petersburg]] is named after him.
Unity and integrity of all organs in human body was the basis of '''Peter Lesgaft''' system of the pointed exercises for both physical development and intellectual, moral and [[aesthetic]] education. 

Outdoor games were his favorite means in both physical development and formation of character of a child.
== Biography ==
'''Peter Lesgaft''' was born on 21 September 1837 in [[Sankt-Petersburg]], the third son of a jeweler of German descent. 
In 1861 he graduated from Imperial Medical-Surgical Academy in St. Petersburg and remained there as a teacher of anatomy. 
In 1869 he became a professor at the University of Kazan, but soon was barred from teaching for his outspoken criticism of the unscientific methods used. In 1872 he became consultant on therapeutic gymnastics in the private practice of Dr. Berglindt. 
In 1872-1874 he supervised a group of Russian women for the first time allowed to employment in the Imperial Medical-Surgical Academy. He also became known for publication of a descriptive history of sport in Europe and ancient Greece and an article on naturalistic gymnastics.  As a result, he was put in charge of the physical training of military cadets. In 1875, he was sponsored by the Russian Military Ministry to spend two summers in Western Europe, studying the systems of physical education. During that time he visited 26 cities in 13 European countries.   He carefully studied British system visiting English public schools, the Central Army Gymnastics School at [[Aldershot]], the Royal Military Academy at [[Woolwich]] and [[Oxford University]]. 
In 1877, he published ‘‘Relationship of Anatomy to Physical Education'' and ‘‘The Major Purpose of Physical Education in Schools''. He was able to organizing courses for physical education instructors for the military academies — until then non-existent. 
In 1893 '''Peter Lesgaft''' organized Biological laboratory which in 1918 was transformed into P.F.Lesgaft Institute of Natural Science.

In [[Greek mythology]], '''Priapus''' ({{IPAc-en|p|r|aɪ|ˈ|eɪ|p|ə|s}};&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.collinsdictionary.com/dictionary/english/priapus?showCookiePolicy=true|title=Priapus
|accessdate=24 September 2014|publisher=Collins Dictionary|date=n.d.}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{lang-grc|Πρίηπος}}, {{grc-transl|Πρίηπος}}) was a minor rustic fertility god, protector of [[livestock]], fruit plants, gardens and male [[genitalia]]. Priapus is marked by his oversized, permanent [[erection]], which gave rise to the medical term [[priapism]]. He became a popular figure in [[Erotic art in Pompeii and Herculaneum|Roman erotic art]] and [[Latin literature]], and is the subject of the often humorously obscene collection of verse called the ''[[Priapeia]]''.

==Relationship with other deities==
Priapus was described as the son of [[Aphrodite]] by [[Dionysus]], or the son of Dionysus and [[Chione (daughter of Boreas)|Chione]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Scholia]] on [[Theocritus]], 1. 21&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps as the father or son of [[Hermes]],&lt;ref&gt;Kerenyi, ''Gods of the Greeks'', 1951, p. 175, noting G. Kaibel, ''Epigrammata graeca ex lapidibus collecta'', 817, where the other god's name, both father and son of Hermes, is obscured; [[Hyginus]] (''Fabulae'' 160) makes Hermes the father of Pan.&lt;/ref&gt; and the son of [[Zeus]] or [[Pan (mythology)|Pan]], depending on the source.&lt;ref&gt;"Priapus". ''The Oxford Companion to World Mythology''. David Leeming. Oxford University Press, 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; According to legend, [[Hera]] cursed him with inconvenient impotence (he could not sustain an erection when the time came for sexual intercourse), ugliness and foul-mindedness while he was still in Aphrodite's womb, in revenge for the hero [[Paris (mythology)|Paris]] having the temerity to judge Aphrodite more beautiful than Hera.&lt;ref&gt;An elaboration on a ''[[scholium]]'' on [[Apollonius of Rhodes]]' ''Argonautica'' i. Kereny remarks of the jealousy of Hera in this case, "a cheap theme, and certainly not an ancient one" (Kerenyi 1951, p.176).&lt;/ref&gt; The other gods refused to allow him to live on [[Mount Olympus]] and threw him down to Earth, leaving him on a hillside. He was eventually found by shepherds and was brought up by them.

Priapus joined Pan and the [[satyr]]s as a spirit of fertility and growth, though he was perennially frustrated by his impotence. In a ribald anecdote told by Ovid,&lt;ref&gt;Ovid, ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'', vi.319ff&lt;/ref&gt; he attempted to rape the goddess [[Hestia]] but was thwarted by an [[donkey|ass]], whose braying caused him to lose his erection at the critical moment and woke Hestia. The episode gave him a lasting hatred of asses and a willingness to see them destroyed in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;"Priapus." ''Who's Who in Classical Mythology'', Routledge. 2002.&lt;/ref&gt; The emblem of his lustful nature was his permanent [[erection]] and his large penis. Another myth states that he pursued the nymph [[Lotis (mythology)|Lotis]] until the gods took pity on her and turned her into a [[lotus tree|lotus]] plant.&lt;ref name="bloomsbury"&gt;"Priapus." ''Bloomsbury Dictionary of Myth''. 1996.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Worship and attributes==
[[File:Pompeya erótica5.jpg|thumb|225px|Priapus depicted with the attributes of [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]] in a fresco found at Pompeii]]
The first extant mention of Priapus is in the eponymous comedy ''Priapus'', written in the 4th century BC by [[Xenarchus]]. Originally worshipped by Greek colonists in [[Lampsacus]] in [[Asia Minor]], the cult of Priapus spread to mainland Greece and eventually to Italy during the 3rd century BC.&lt;ref name="ocd"&gt;Robert Christopher Towneley Parker. "Priapus". ''The Oxford Classical Dictionary.'' Ed. Simon Hornblower and Anthony Spawforth. Oxford University Press 2003.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lucian]] (''De saltatione'') tells that in [[Bithynia]] Priapus was accounted as a warlike god, a rustic tutor to the infant [[Ares]], "who taught him dancing first and war only afterwards," [[Karl Kerenyi]] observed.&lt;ref&gt;Kerenyi, ''Gods of the Greeks'', 1951, p. 154, also pp.  175–77. .&lt;/ref&gt; [[Arnobius]] is aware of the importance accorded Priapus in this region near the [[Hellespont]].&lt;ref&gt;In ridiculing the literal aspects of pagan gods given human form, he mentions "the Hellespontian Priapus bearing about among the goddesses, virgin and matron, those parts ever prepared for encounter." (Arnobius, ''Seven Books against the Heathen'' III.10 ([http://www.intratext.com/IXT/ENG1008/_P3.HTM on-line text]).&lt;/ref&gt; Also, Pausanias notes:
{{quote|This god is worshipped where goats and sheep pasture or there are swarms of bees; but by the people of Lampsacus he is more revered than any other god, being called by them a son of Dionysus and Aphrodite.&lt;ref&gt;Pausanias, ''Description of Greece'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Paus.+9.31.2 9.31.2].&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In later antiquity, his worship meant little more than a cult of sophisticated pornography.&lt;ref&gt;Mark P.O. Morford, Robert J. Lenardon, Michael Sham. (2011, 9th ed.). "Classical Mythology" (New York, NY.: Oxford University Press) {{ISBN|978-0-19-539770-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Outside his "home" region in Asia Minor, Priapus was regarded as something of a joke by urban dwellers. However, he played a more important role in the countryside, where he was seen as a guardian deity. He was regarded as the patron god of sailors and fishermen and others in need of good luck, and his presence was believed to avert the [[evil eye]].&lt;ref&gt;"Priapus." Encyclopædia Britannica. 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Priapus does not appear to have had an organized cult and was mostly worshiped in gardens or homes, though there are attestations of temples dedicated to the god. His sacrificial animal was the [[ass (animal)|ass]], but agricultural offerings (such as fruit, flowers, vegetables and fish) were also very common.&lt;ref name="ocd" /&gt;

Long after the fall of Rome and the rise of [[Christianity]], Priapus continued to be invoked as a symbol of health and fertility. The 13th century [[Lanercost Chronicle]], a history of northern England and Scotland, records a "lay [[Cistercian]] brother" erecting a statue of Priapus (''simulacrum Priapi statuere'') in an attempt to end an outbreak of cattle disease.&lt;ref&gt;Yves Bonnefoy, ''Roman and European Mythologies'', pp. 139–142. University of Chicago Press, 1992. {{ISBN|0-226-06455-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1980s, D. F. Cassidy founded the [[St. Priapus Church]] as a modern church centred on worship of the [[phallus]].&lt;ref&gt;[[J. Gordon Melton]] (1996, 5th ed.). ''Encyclopedia of American Religions'' (Detroit, Mich.: Gale) {{ISBN|0-8103-7714-4}} p. 952.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Andy Nyberg, "St. Priapus Church: The Organized Religion", ''[[The Advocate (LGBT magazine)|The Advocate]]'', Sep. 1983, pp. 35–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Depictions==
[[File:Musée Picardie Archéo 03.jpg|thumb|upright|225px|[[Gallo-Roman culture|Gallo-Roman]] bronze statuette (ca 1st century CE) of Priapus (or a [[Hooded Spirits|Genius cucullatus?]]) discovered in [[Picardy]], northern France, made in two parts, with the top section concealing a giant phallus.]]

Priapus' iconic attribute was his [[priapism]] (permanently erect [[penis]]); he probably absorbed some pre-existing [[phallus|ithyphallic]] deities as his cult developed. He was represented in a variety of ways, most commonly as a misshapen gnome-like figure with an enormous erect phallus. Statues of Priapus were common in ancient Greece and Rome, standing in gardens. The [[Athens|Athenians]] often conflated Priapus with [[Hermes]], the god of boundaries, and depicted a hybrid deity with a winged helmet, sandals, and huge erection.&lt;ref name="bloomsbury" /&gt;

Another attribute of Priapus was the sickle which he often carries in his right hand. This too was used to threaten thieves, doubtless with castration:&lt;ref&gt;[[Lloyd deMause|deMause, Lloyd]] (ed.) (1976), ''The History of Childhood'', p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For the sickle used for the castration of sacrificial animals, see Burkert, Walter (1983) ''Homo Necans: The Anthropology of Ancient Greek Ritual and Myth'', translated by Peter Bing, p. 68, quoting Martial 3.24.&lt;/ref&gt; Horace (''Sat.'' 1.8.1–7) writes:&lt;ref&gt;Moul, V. A. (2016). [https://kclpure.kcl.ac.uk/portal/files/57785240/source_for_priapus_cowley_note.pdf "The Source for Priapus in Cowley’s Ode “To The Royal Society” (1667)"], p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Olim truncus eram ficulnus, inutile lignum,&lt;br /&gt;cum faber, incertus scamnum faceretne Priapum,&lt;br /&gt;maluit esse deum. deus inde ego, furum aviumque&lt;br /&gt;maxima formido; nam fures dextra coercet&lt;br /&gt;obscenoque ruber porrectus ab inguine palus;&lt;br /&gt;ast importunes volucres in vertice harundo&lt;br /&gt;terret fixa vetatque novis considere in hortis.''
:"Once I was a trunk of fig, a useless piece of wood,&lt;br /&gt;when a carpenter, unsure whether he should make a bench or a Priapus,&lt;br /&gt;decided to make a god. So I am a god, of thieves and birds&lt;br /&gt;a very great scarer; for my right hand curbs thieves,&lt;br /&gt;as does the red pole which projects from my indecent groin;&lt;br /&gt;but as for the importunate birds, the reed fixed on my head&lt;br /&gt;terrifies them and forbids them to settle in the new gardens."

A number of [[epigram]]s, apparently written as if to adorn shrines of Priapus, were collected in the ''[[Priapeia]]''. In these, Priapus frequently threatens sexual assault against potential thieves:&lt;ref&gt;Craig A. Williams, ''Roman Homosexuality: Ideologies of Masculinity in Classical Antiquity'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=STP5BgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT46 p. 21]. Oxford University Press US, 1999. {{ISBN|0-19-512505-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:''Percidere, puer, moneo; futuere, puella;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;barbatum furem tertia poena manet.''
:"I warn you, boy, you will be screwed; girl, you will be laid with;&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;a third penalty awaits the bearded thief."

:''Femina si furtum faciet mihi virve puerve,&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;haec cunnum, caput hic praebeat, ille nates.
:"If a woman steals from me, or a man, or a boy,&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;let the first give me her cunt, the second his head, the third his buttocks."

:''per medios ibit pueros mediasque puellas&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;mentula; barbatis non-nisi summa petet.''
:"My dick will go through the middle of boys and the middle of girls,&lt;br /&gt;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;&amp;nbsp;but with bearded men it will aim only for the top."

A number of Roman paintings of Priapus have survived. One of the most famous images of Priapus is that from the [[House of the Vettii]] in [[Pompeii]]. A [[fresco]] depicts the god weighing his phallus against a large bag of coins. In nearby [[Herculaneum]], an excavated snack bar has a painting of Priapus behind the bar, apparently as a good-luck symbol for the customers.{{citation needed|date=February 2014}}

==In literature==
As well as the collection known as the ''[[Priapeia]]'' mentioned above, Priapus was a frequent figure in Latin erotic or mythological verse.

In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Fasti (poem)|Fasti]]'',&lt;ref&gt;Fasti, 6.319ff.&lt;/ref&gt; the [[nymph]] [[Lotis (mythology)|Lotis]] fell into a drunken slumber at a feast, and Priapus seized this opportunity to advance upon her. With stealth he approached, and just before he could embrace her, [[Silenus]]'s donkey alerted the party with "raucous braying". Lotis awoke and pushed Priapus away, but her only true escape was to be transformed into the [[lotus tree]]. To punish the donkey for spoiling his opportunity, Priapus bludgeoned it to death with his gargantuan phallus. In later versions of the story, Lotis is replaced with the virginal goddess [[Hestia]].{{Citation needed|date=September 2011}} Ovid's anecdote served to explain why donkeys were sacrificed to Priapus in the city of [[Lampsacus]] on the Hellespont, where he was worshipped among the offspring of [[Hermes]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Gaius Julius Hyginus|Hyginus]], ''Fabulae'', 160.&lt;/ref&gt;

Priapus is repeatedly mentioned in Petronius's ''[[Satyricon]]''. William Arrowsmith, in the introduction and notes to his translation of the work, draws parallels between his hounding of the protagonist and that of [[Poseidon]] in Homer's ''[[Odyssey]]''.

Priapus is mentioned in Geoffrey Chaucer's "[[The Merchant's Tale]]", part of ''[[The Canterbury Tales]]''.
During a description of a garden that the protagonist, Januarie, creates, Priapus is invoked in his form as God of gardens:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
&lt;poem&gt;
Ne Priapus ne myghte nat suffise,
Though he be God of gardyns, for to telle
The beautee of the gardyn and the welle,
That stood under a laurer alwey grene.&lt;ref&gt;G. Chaucer, ''The Merchant's Prologue and Tale'', (Cambridge University Press, Cambridge, 2006), p63&lt;/ref&gt;

(Priapus might not suffice,
Though he be god of gardens, to tell
Of the beauty of the garden and the well
That stood under the laurel, always green.)
&lt;/poem&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;
Priapus serves to remind the reader, or listening audience, that Januarie's intentions are driven by lust and not love.

Priapus is mentioned in [[William Carlos Williams]]'s poem "[[Paterson (poem)|Paterson]]". Priapus is also mentioned in John Steinbeck's ''[[East of Eden (novel)|East of Eden]]'': "She conducted her house like a cathedral dedicated to a sad but erect Priapus."

[[T.S. Eliot]] refers to Priapus in his poem "Mr. Appolinax" (published in ''Prufrock and Other Observations'', 1920): "When Mr. Apollinax visited the United States / His laughter tinkled among the teacups. / I thought of Fragilion, that shy figure among the birch-trees,/ And of Priapus in the shrubbery / Gaping at the lady in the swing."

Priapus is also mentioned in Vladimir Nabokov's ''[[Invitation to a Beheading]]'': "Or when you, with eyes closed tight, devouring a spurting peach and then, having finished, but still swallowing, with your mouth still full, you cannibal, your glazed eyes wandered, your fingers were spread, your inflamed lips were all glossy, your chin trembled, all covered with drops of the cloudy juice, which trickled down onto your bared bosom, while the Priapus who had nourished you suddenly, with a convulsive oath, turned his back to me, who had entered the room at the wrong moment."

Priap[us] is mentioned as well in Nabokov's ''[[Lolita]]'': "She was the loveliest nymphet green-red-blue Priap himself could think up".

== Patron of merchant sailing ==
Priapus' role as a patron god for merchant sailors in ancient Greece and Rome is that of a protector and navigational aide. Recent shipwreck evidence contains apotropaic items carried onboard by mariners in the forms of a terracotta phallus, wooden Priapus figure, and bronze sheath from a military ram. Coinciding with the use of wooden Priapic markers erected in areas of dangerous passage or particular landing areas for sailors, the function of Priapus is much more extensive than previously thought.&lt;ref name=neilson&gt;Neilson III, Harry R.  2002.  "A terracotta phallus from Pisa Ship E: more evidence for the Priapus deity as protector of Greek and Roman navigators."  ''The International Journal of Nautical Archaeology'' 31.2: 248–253.&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Priapus is commonly associated with the failed attempts of [[rape]] against the nymphs Lotis and Vesta in Ovid's comedy Fasti&lt;ref&gt;Fantham, Elaine.  1983.  "Sexual Comedy in Ovid's Fasti: Sources and Motivation." ''Harvard Studies in Classical Philology'' 87: 185.&lt;/ref&gt; and the rather flippant treatment of the deity in urban settings, Priapus' protection traits can be traced back to the importance placed on the [[phallus]] in ancient times (particularly his association with fertility and garden protection).&lt;ref name=neilson/&gt; In Greece, the phallus was thought of to have a mind of its own, animal-like, separate from the mind and control of the man.&lt;ref&gt;Csapo, Eric. 1997. "Riding the Phallus for Dionysus: Iconology, Ritual, and Gender-Role De/Construction." ''Phoenix'' 51.3/4: 260.&lt;/ref&gt;  The phallus is also associated with "possession and territorial demarcation" in many cultures, attributing to Priapus' other role as a navigational deity.&lt;ref name=neilson/&gt;

==Modern derivations==

===Medical terminology===
The medical condition [[priapism]] derives its name from Priapus, alluding to the god's permanently engorged penis.

===Natural history===
* The group of worm-like marine burrowing animals known as the [[Priapulida|Priapulidea]], literally "penis worms", also derives its name from Priapus.
* ''[[Mutinus caninus]]'', a woodland fungus, draws its first name from Priapus's Roman name, due to its phallic shape.

===In popular culture===
* It has been suggested by some scholars that the modern popular [[garden gnome]] is a descendant of Priapus.&lt;ref&gt;Peter D. Arnott, ''An Introduction to the Roman World.'' London: MacMillan, 1970; Judith Harris, ''Pompeii Awakened: A Story of Rediscovery.'' I.B.Tauris, 2007, p. 117. {{ISBN|1-84511-241-5}}. Hugh Lloyd-Jones, ''Greek in a Cold Climate.'' Rowman &amp; Littlefield, 1991, p. 64. {{ISBN|0-389-20967-8}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In [[Sherrilyn Kenyon]]'s ''[[Fantasy Lover]]'', Priapus is Julian's half-brother, who cursed him to live in the book and only come out to be someone's lover from full moon to full moon.
* Doujinshi artist Mentaiko wrote a [[Bara (genre)|bara]] [[doujinshi]] [[manga]] inspired by the Priapus mythos in 2011. The manga is currently ongoing.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.mangago.me/read-manga/priapus/&lt;/ref&gt;
* Nicolas Presl interprets the myth in his wordless graphic novel "Priape" (Genève, Atrabile, 2006)
* 2014 Indie Game ''A Date in the Park'' uses Priapus as a clue for the main character to find his love interest.

'''Spanish Costa Rican''' are people from [[Costa Rica]] with Spanish ancestry from both the conquerors of the [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|colonial period]] as immigrants who arrived after independence and the [[Central American Federation]] of disunion. Historically this part of the population was called [[Criollo people|Criollo]] and were privileged but did not have equal rights with the [[Spaniards]], some of them were mixed with [[Mestizos]]. Approximately 16,482 Spanish citizens living in Costa Rica for 2009.&lt;ref&gt;''Censo electoral de españoles residentes en el extranjero 2009'' [http://www.ine.es/censoe/censo_cerrado/index.html INE-Censo cerrado.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100127104640/http://www.ine.es/censoe/censo_cerrado/index.html |date=27 January 2010 }} Retrieved 2014-12-08.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Immigration ==
The [[Spanish diaspora|Spanish immigration]] began with the exploration of [[Hernán Ponce de León]] and [[Juan Castañeda|Juan de Castañeda]] along the Pacific coast, soon after led to the native population of this region under Spanish control. Although a small number of colonists settled in [[Costa Rica]] because of the small number of Indians who inhabited the region.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.angelfire.com/bc/gonebirding/colony.html La conquista española y colonización] Retrieved 2014-12-08.&lt;/ref&gt; After independence, the governors were interested in populating the territories with white workers, preferably imported from Europe. After independence, the governors were interested in populating territories with [[white people]] workers, preferably brought from Europe, banana cultivation was attracting a lot of capital and labor for the construction of the railway to the Atlantic.

=== Catalan Immigration ===
In the early twentieth century many Spaniards used Costa Rica as a bridge to move to Panama attracted by the construction of the Canal. The events in Catalonia for the same dates Catalan prompted many to migrate to Costa Rica, becoming in a few years a thriving and influential Catalan colony that persists today. This colony, located in San Jose (Costa Rica) came to consist mainly of Catalan, followed by Gallegos, Asturian and Castilian. Currently the Catalans make up most of the community of Spaniards in Costa Rica.

===Canarian Immigration===

Some Canarians had already settled in Costa Rica, beginning in the 16th century; a Canarian from [[Lanzarote]] island, Jose Martinez, was among the first Spanish settlers to arrive in [[Costa Rica]] in the 16th century&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Francisco Hernández Delgado|author2=María Dolores Rodríguez Armas|title=La emigración de Lanzarote y sus causas|url=http://www.archivoteguise.es/publicacion/2/la-emigracion-de-lanzarote-y-sus-causas|website=Archivo Histórico Municipal de Teguise (www.archivoteguise.es)|publisher=Departamento de Cultura y Patrimonio, Ayuntamiento de Teguise|accessdate=27 July 2016|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160727180641/http://www.archivoteguise.es/publicacion/2/la-emigracion-de-lanzarote-y-sus-causas|archivedate=July 27, 2016|location=Teguise, Lanzarote, Canary Islands|language=Spanish|date=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;. But large-scale Canarian immigration took place in 1884, when over 8,000 Canarians emigrated to a small town when the Costa Rican government invited Canarian immigration to populate the uninhabited town.&lt;ref&gt;

== Costa Ricans of Spanish ancestry ==
[[File:Niños costarricenses.JPG|thumb|250px|right|Costa Rican children at a Costa Rican School. Note that many have Hispanic features.]]

The mark on the Spanish in [[Costa Ricans|Costa Rican society]] is very large so much ethnic and cultural, about 80% of the white population is overwhelmingly of Spanish origin, and 17% of the population is [[mestizo]] (Spanish with [[Indigenous peoples|native]]). According to a genetic study called "Geographic Patterns of Genome Admixture in Latin American Mestizos" the most comprehensive study of mestizo populations of Latin America and published in 2008 in the journal PLoS Genetics, and in which participated the School of Biology, [[University of Costa Rica]], the average resident of the Central Valley of Costa Rica has 65% of European genes (42.5% Spaniards), 30% [[Indigenous peoples|native]] and 5% [[Ethnic groups of Africa|African population]].&lt;ref&gt;''PLOS Genetics'':[http://www.plosgenetics.org/article/info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000037?imageURI=info:doi/10.1371/journal.pgen.1000037.g001#pgen.1000037.s003 Geographic Patterns of Genome Admixture in Latin American Mestizos] Retrieved on, 8 November 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; In total the Spaniards contributed very largely on the genetics of Costa Ricans, being the Spanish and mestizo place greater weight in the nation (90%), other European (7%), Chinese, blacks and Arabs (2%) and communities Indians (1%).

=== Notables Spanish Costa Ricans ===
Notables Costa Ricans of Spanish descent or part Spaniard, we are taking into account those who have certain inherited Spanish blood (mestizos and lineal descendants), this inheritance are acquiring all generations of these, but now many Costa Rican Hispanics are mixed with Asians, descendants of other Europeans or with descendants of Africans.

'''Stranded Pakistanis in Bangladesh''' ({{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|پھنسے ہوئے پاکستانی}}}}, {{lang-bn|উদ্বাস্তু পাকিস্তানী}}) are [[Urdu]]-speaking Muslim migrants with homelands in present-day [[India]] and [[Pakistan]] who settled in [[East Pakistan]] (now [[Bangladesh]]) following the [[partition of India]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Stranded Pakistanis Dreaming of Deliverance |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/13/world/stranded-pakistanis-dreaming-of-deliverance.html |newspaper=The New York Times |date=13 May 2000 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=BBC1&gt;{{cite news |title=Vote for 'stranded Pakistanis' |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/3003949.stm |work=BBC News|date=6 May 2003 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="The Guardian"&gt;{{cite news |title='Stranded Pakistanis' living in camps in Bangladesh – in pictures |url=https://www.theguardian.com/global-development/gallery/2014/aug/11/stranded-pakistanis-camps-bangladesh-bihari-in-pictures |newspaper=The Guardian |date=11 August 2014 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=SC rejects plea for repatriation of stranded Pakistanis |url=http://www.dawn.com/news/1173194/sc-rejects-plea-for-repatriation-of-stranded-pakistanis |newspaper=Dawn |date=1 April 2015 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Express Tribune"&gt;{{cite news |title=SC rejects plea regarding repatriation of stranded Pakistanis in Bangladesh |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/861834/sc-rejects-plea-regarding-repatriation-of-stranded-pakistanis-in-bangladesh/ |newspaper=The Express Tribune |date=31 March 2015 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Repatriation of stranded Pakistanis |url=http://www.daily-sun.com/print/editorial/2015/02/22/489052 |newspaper=Daily Sun |location=Dhaka |date=22 February 2015 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This identification can encompass several groups of people. First among them is "[[Bihari Muslims]]". Although most of this population belonged to [[Bihar|State of Bihar]] in India there are many from other Indian states such as U.P. (United Provinces or later [[Uttar Pradesh]]). There are still others who had settled in what is now known as Bangladesh in the late 19th century.  The second term of reference for this group coined by themselves after creation of Bangladesh is "Stranded Pakistanis". In [[Urdu]] media in Pakistan and elsewhere this was translated as "Mehsooreen" or the "Besieged". Another common term is "Non-Bengalis", which includes not only the Urdu-speaking but also [[Punjabis]], [[Pashtun people|Pathans]] and [[Baloch people|Baloch]] living in Bangladesh.{{cn|date=November 2017}} Henceforth any of the above terms may be used to identify this group depending on the context and history.

Biharis were [[Statelessness|stateless]] until 2008 when a judgement by the Dhaka High Court gave them right of citizenship. The judgement does not cover refugees who were adults at the time of [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].&lt;ref name=BBC&gt;{{cite news |title=Citizenship for Bihari refugees |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/south_asia/7407757.stm |work=BBC News |date=19 May 2008 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In March 2015, [[Ministry of Foreign Affairs (Pakistan)|Ministry of Foreign Affairs of Pakistan]] said that more than 170,000 Biharis had been repatriated to Pakistan and the remaining 'stranded Pakistanis' are not its responsibility but rather the responsibility of Bangladesh.&lt;ref name=Tribune&gt;{{cite news |title=Stranded Pakistanis in Bangladesh not Pakistan's responsibility, FO tells SC |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/861364/stranded-pakistanis-in-bangladesh-not-pakistans-responsibility-fo-tells-sc/ |newspaper=The Express Tribune |date=30 March 2015 |accessdate=26 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partition==
In pre-independence [[British India]], there was an [[Urdu]]-speaking Muslim minority in the Hindu majority state of [[Bihar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refugeesinternational.org/content/article/detail/8245  Bangladesh: Stateless Biharis Grasp for a Resolution and Their Rights - Refugees international] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321134045/http://www.refugeesinternational.org/content/article/detail/8245 |date=21 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[1947]], at the time of [[partition of India]], the Bihari Muslims, many of whom were fleeing the violence that took place during partition, fled to the newly independent [[East Pakistan]]. They held a disproportionate number of positions in the new country due to the fact that Urdu was made the national language of the new state and as such was, for many Biharis, their mother tongue.  This led to much resentment from the native [[Bengali people|Bengali]]s, who had to acquire a new language and were at a disadvantage on their own soil.

==Independence of Bangladesh==
In 1971, when the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]] broke out between East and [[West Pakistan]], the Biharis sided with West Pakistan, opposed the Bengali demand of making Bengali an official language, and chose to maintain [[Urdu]] as the state language as for many Bihari, it was their mother tongue. With covert and later overt Indian support, East Pakistan became the independent state of [[Bangladesh]]. During the war there were "many attacks on the Bihari community as they were seen as symbols of Pakistani domination."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/chronology.asp?groupId=77103 Chronology for Biharis in Bangladesh - Minorities at Risk, University of Maryland] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100602055513/http://www.cidcm.umd.edu/mar/chronology.asp?groupId=77103 |date=2 June 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1971/12/22/archives/bengalis-hunt-down-biharis-who-aided-foe.html|title=Bengalis Hunt Down Biharis, Who Aided Foe|last=Rangan|first=Kasturi|date=1971-12-22|work=The New York Times|access-date=2018-02-02|language=en-US|issn=0362-4331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Refugee crisis==
The Biharis were now left behind as the Pakistani army and Pakistani civilians evacuated, and they found themselves unwelcome in both countries. Pakistan feared a mass influx of Biharis could destabilize a fragile and culturally mixed population which shared no similarity with the Bihari; furthermore, the Pakistani government believed that since Bangladesh was still the successor state of East Pakistan, it had to fulfil its duty in absorbing these refugees just as Pakistan (West) did with the many millions of refugees (incidentally, including Bangali) who fled to West Pakistan. Some groups in Pakistan have urged the Pakistan government to accept the Biharis.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.arabnews.com/?page=4&amp;section=0&amp;article=75378&amp;d=28&amp;m=12&amp;y=2005&amp;pix=world.jpg&amp;category=World PRC Wants Urgent Steps for Biharis’ Repatriation - Arab News]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dawn.com/2004/02/08/nat6.htm MQM demands issuance of CNICs to Biharis-2004 : Dawn]&lt;/ref&gt;

In an agreement in 1974 Pakistan accepted 170,000 Bihari refugees; however, the repatriation process subsequently stalled.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.safhr.org/refugee_watch18_4.htm Bangladesh State and the Refugee Phenomenon : South Asian forum for Human Rights - The Bihari Refugees]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Post-independence Bangladesh scorned the Biharis for having supporting the Pakistan army. With neither country offering citizenship, the Biharis were stateless. Organisations like [[Refugees International]] urged the governments of Pakistan and Bangladesh to "grant citizenship to the hundreds of thousands of people who remain without effective nationality".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refugeesinternational.org/content/publication/detail/7828/ Citizens of Nowhere: The Stateless Biharis of Bangladesh - Refugees International 2006 report] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070614045741/http://www.refugeesinternational.org/content/publication/detail/7828/ |date=14 June 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2006 a report estimated between 240,000 and 300,000 Biharis lived in 66 crowded camps in [[Dhaka]] and 13 other regions across Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;Refugees International (see below)&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, a case came before a high court in which ten Biharis were awarded citizenship according to the court's interpretation of the constitution. Subsequently, however, little progress was made in expanding that ruling to others.  Many Pakistanis and international observers believe the plight of the Biharis has been politicized with political parties giving the refugees false hopes and impracticable expectations.  In recent years, several court rulings in Bangladesh have awarded citizenship to Biharis living in Bengali refugee camps, as the majority of these refugees were born there.  International observers believe that Bangladesh, as the successor state needs to fulfil its international obligations and grant citizenship to this ''officially stateless'' ethnic group or arrange for the peaceful repatriation to their native state of Bihar, over the border in India from where they originally hail from. ref&gt;. 

In a visit to Bangladesh in 2002 Pakistani president [[Pervez Musharraf]] said while he had every sympathy for the plight of thousands of people in Bangladesh known as 'stranded Pakistanis', he could not allow them to emigrate to Pakistan as Pakistan was in no position to absorb such a large number of refugees which shared no linguistic, cultural or history with that of Pakistan.  He encouraged his Bengali counterpart not to politicize the issue and accept the refugees as citizens being the successor state of East Pakistan.  Pakistani government officials have threatened to deport the more than 1.5 million illegal Bengali refugees living in its country if the issue is not resolved acceptably.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/2163374.stmMusharraf wraps up Bangladesh visit - BBC News - 31 July, 2002]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Bangladeshi citizenship==
In May 2003 a high court ruling in Bangladesh allowed 10 Biharis to obtain citizenship and voting rights;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/3003949.stm  Vote for 'stranded Pakistanis' - BBC News 6 May, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; the ruling also exposed a generation gap amongst Biharis, with younger Biharis tending to being "elated" with the ruling but with many older people "despair[ing] at the enthusiasm" of the younger generation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/south_asia/2941974.stm Mixed feelings over Bihari ruling - BBC News 28 May, 2003]&lt;/ref&gt; Many Biharis now seek greater civil rights and citizenship in Bangladesh.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refugeesinternational.org/content/article/detail/8245  Bangladesh: Stateless Biharis Grasp for a Resolution and Their Rights -Refugees International] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070321134045/http://www.refugeesinternational.org/content/article/detail/8245 |date=21 March 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== In popular culture ==
''Of Martyrs and Marigolds'', a novel by [[Aquila Ismail]], highlights the atrocities committed by [[Mukti Bahini|Bengali nationalists]] against [[Biharis]] during the [[Bangladesh Liberation War]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Zehra |first1=Batool |title=The other side of history |url=http://tribune.com.pk/story/340653/the-other-side-of-history/ |newspaper=The Express Tribune |date=26 February 2012 |accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Tamil Lexicon''''' ([[Tamil language|Tamil]]: தமிழ்ப் பேரகராதி ''Tamiḻ Pērakarāti'') is a twelve-volume [[dictionary]] of the [[Tamil language]]. Published by the [[University of Madras]], it is said to be the most comprehensive dictionary of the Tamil language to date. On the basis of several precursors, including [[Rottler's Tamil–English Dictionary]], [[Winslow's Tamil–English Dictionary]], and [[Pope's Compendious Tamil–English Dictionary]], work on a more exhaustive dictionary began in January 1913 and the first forms were printed by the end of 1923. Initially estimated at {{INR}} 100,000, the total cost of the project came to about {{INR}} 410,000. The first edition had 4,351 pages in seven volumes, including a one-volume supplement, which were printed between 1924 and 1939 and had 104,405 words, with an additional 13,357 words in the supplementary volume, totaling to 124,405 words &lt;ref&gt;http://www.thehindu.com/2005/04/29/stories/2005042915320300.htm&lt;/ref&gt; in all.

The dictionary was reprinted in 1956 and 1982. Work on the revised and expanded edition of the dictionary, being published in twelve volumes, began on 1 May 2003, with the first volume published in 2012 under the vice-chancellorship of K. Thiruvasagam.&lt;ref name="Hindu_DelayHowlersEmbarrassScholars"/&gt; The revised edition of the dictionary will include words taken from secondary sources like modern and old literary works, newspapers, scientific journals and inscriptions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

==History==

Although the origin of the Tamil language dates back to antiquity, the first regular lexicon of the language, with words arranged alphabetically, did not appear until the eighteenth century.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Lexicons of the earlier period were not arranged alphabetically but metrically, on the basis of the first-letter rhyme, a characteristic of [[Tamil poetry]]. ''Agaraadhi Nigandu'' was the first alphabetically arranged lexicon published in 1594. Several dictionaries followed suit, including those by the foreign missionaries, such as ''Palporut Choolaamani'', ''Podhigai Nigandu'', Tamil–Portuguese Dictionary of Fr. Antem de Proenca, ''Dictionarium Tamulicum'', ''Chathur Agaraadhi'', Fabricius's Tamil–English Dictionary, ''Manual Dictionary of the Tamil Language'' (The Jaffna Dictionary), ''Oru Sor Pala Porul Vilakkam'', Rottler's Tamil–English Dictionary, Winslow's Tamil–English Dictionary, Pope's Compendious Tamil–English Dictionary, Classical Tamil–English Dictionary, Tamil Pocket Dictionary, Tranquebar Dictionary, N. Kadhirvel Pillai's Dictionary, Sangam Dictionary, and ''Ilakkiya Sol Agaraadhi''.

When the 67,542-words Winslow's Tamil–English Dictionary, which was sourced on the unpublished work of Rev. Joseph Night and Rev. Samuel Hutsings, was published in 1862 by the American Mission Press, it was considered the best lexicon available at that time. This dictionary by [[Miron Winslow]] was based on the works of [[Johann Rottler]], which itself was inspired from [[Johann Fabricius]]'s work in the mid-18th century. Winslow was sent out to [[Jaffna]] and then transferred to [[Madras]] by the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]]. In both the places, he collaborated with Arumuga Navalar. It had the most number of words of any Tamil dictionary up to the time. The copyright of the dictionary was held by the American Ceylon Mission.&lt;ref name="Hindu_TheTamilLexicon"&gt;{{cite news

Soon there was a demand to revise the Winslow dictionary. However, the mission suffered from lack of funds due to the closure of the Arbuthnot Bank. Citing lack of scholars in [[Ceylon]] (now [[Sri Lanka]]), it then sought the help of the Madras branch of the Christian Literature Society.&lt;ref name="Hindu_TheTamilLexicon"/&gt;

[[G. U. Pope]], upon hearing of these plans, offered to give his collection of material for an exhaustive lexicon of the Tamil language. As he had retired to [[Oxford]] to work on the Tamil Classics, he suggested an editor be sent out to Oxford to work with him on the re-issue of Winslow's dictionary. The [[Government of Madras]] and the University of Madras reacted positively to Pope's suggestion. However, before any concrete decision could be taken, Pope died in 1907. In 1909, his son came to Madras with his father's papers and gifted them to the [[Oriental Manuscripts Library]], permitting the use of the material for any new Tamil dictionary. In 1910, [[J. S. Chandler]] of the American Mission, then residing in [[Kodaikanal]], forwarded a proposal to the Madras government on the new Tamil dictionary project.&lt;ref name="Hindu_TheTamilLexicon"/&gt;



With the Pope's collection it had, the government reacted to Chandler's proposal in January 1911 by appointing a five-member Lexicon committee comprising a representative each from the government, the university, the [[Madras Tamil Sangam]], and the missionary bodies of Ceylon and [[South India]]. Chandler, who was nominated by South Indian missionaries, was appointed chairman of the committee and was asked to work full-time as editor of the project.&lt;ref name="Hindu_TheTamilLexicon"/&gt;

Detailed discussions took place for the next couple of years, and the University of Madras was made supervisor of the project. The total cost of the project was estimated at {{INR}} 100,000 for a period of five years that the project was expected to take.&lt;ref name="Hindu_TheTamilLexicon"/&gt;

Work on the project began on 1 January 1919, with the appointment of three pundits, three clerks and two typists. The scholars included a Tamil pundit, a [[Sanskrit]] pundit and one familiar with the other [[Dravidian languages]] and [[Urdu]]. M. Raghava Iyangar of [[Ramnad]], a Tamil scholar, assumed the leader of the team. Incidentally, the Tamil [[typewriter]] used for the project, with a keyboard developed by Yost of the American Mission, was the first to be ever used in an office in India.&lt;ref name="Hindu_TheTamilLexicon"/&gt;

When Chandler retired in 1922 at the age of 80, about 81,000 words had been compiled. Few more words were added soon, and in 1924 the Lexicon went to press. With the University of Madras holding the copyright, the printing of the work was entrusted to the Diocesan Press (now CLS Press), which had earlier printed the Winslow's dictionary as the American Mission Press.&lt;ref name="Hindu_TheTamilLexicon"/&gt;

In 1926, S. Vaiyapuri Pillai was appointed editor for the project. Further delays resulted in the final volume of the dictionary getting published only in 1936, with Pillai continuing as editor till the project was completed in 1939.&lt;ref name="Hindu_DelayHowlersEmbarrassScholars"/&gt; In 1939, an additional 20,000 words collected for the Lexicon were published. In 1954, a concise version of the lexicon was published.&lt;ref name="Hindu_TheTamilLexicon"/&gt;

The dictionary was digitised in 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''Volga Tatars of Kazakhstan''' are a minority in [[Kazakhstan]], and make up 1.5% of the population. There are 249,000 [[Volga Tatars]] living in Kazakhstan accordingly to 1999 census (see [[Demographics of Kazakhstan]]).

[[Volga Tatars]] have penetrated the area that is today Kazakhstan from the nineteenth century, entering the region as traders offering manufactured goods to nomadic Kazakhs. They were also [[Islam|Islamic]] missionaries, and Tatar settlers were the conduit of [[Islam]] into the region.

Volga Tatars became well assimilated in Kazakhstani society. During the Soviet period many Tatars occupied positions in the medium-level administration and they comprised a significant part of the Kazakhstani intelligentsia.

Now each Kazakhstan oblast has its own Tatar cultural centre, dedicated to preserve ethnic identity.

The '''Thakali''' are an ethnolinguistic group originating from the Thak Khola region of the [[Mustang District]] in the [[Dhaulagiri]] zone of [[Nepal]]. Thak-sat-se is the traditional area of the Thakali community, which lies in the salt trading zone on the south of [[Tukuche]] mountain, the valley of the [[Kali Gandaki]] river in western Nepal. According to 2001 census, Thakali's population of around 13,000 constitute only 0.06% of Nepal's population. There are around 30,000 Thakali in Nepal, of which are Buddhist, [[Hindus]] and some both.

The Thakalis are some of Nepal's most successful businessmen. They trade in places like Tukuche and Thaksatse. They generalised their population as they moved towards modern lifestyle. They were classified according to the place of Mustang they came from. Furthermore, many are owners of Nepal's hotels and motels. However, due to extensive trade all over [[Nepal]], [[Sikkim]], [[Bhutan]] and [[Tibet]], many Thakalis have resettled in [[Pokhara]],  [[Kathmandu]] and in southern Nepal. You will also see good number of them in [[Japan]] and in [[England]] these days. Due to this, the Thakalis outside their homeland follow a form of [[Tibetan Buddhism]], while Thakalis in southern Nepal practice [[Buddhism]] with bit of Hindu flavor. Those in [[Mustang District|Mustang]] remain much more traditionally [[Buddhist]].

&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Thakali: A Himalayan Ethnography|last=Vinding|first=Michael|publisher=Serindia Publications, Inc.|year=1998|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Thakali have their own [[Thakali language]] (''Panchgaunle'') and their own culture regarding birth, marriage and death ceremony. They have their own festivals like [[Tungla]] and [[Fala (festival)|Fala]].

The Thakalis are very organized people. They have neat kitchens and keep tidy houses. [[Lhafewa]] (Bar Barse Kumbha Mela), Tornala (ancestral worship) and Falo (Kumar Yatra) are the major festivals of the Thakali. Dhnom is the title of the Thakali priest who works as the local [[shaman]]. [[Madaal]], Khaprang, and Thamken are their main musical instruments.

The '''Cimba''' {{IPA-xx|tʃimba|}}, also spelled '''Tjimba''', are a remote, [[Herero language|Herero-speaking]] [[hunter-gatherer]] people of the [[Kaokoveld]] desert in northwest [[Namibia]] and southwest [[Angola]], in the mountain ranges bordering the [[Kunene River]]. They continue to use [[stone tool]]s, and use ''[[Adenium boehmianum]]'' to poison their arrows.&lt;ref&gt;Neuwinger, Hans Dieter. 1996. ''African ethnobotany: poisons and drugs : chemistry, pharmacology, toxicology'', p. 97. &lt;/ref&gt; 

Their [[Herero people|Herero]] neighbors portray them as Herero who have lost their cattle and are therefore impoverished, but they are a distinct people, both culturally and physically.&lt;ref&gt;McCalman, H.R. and B.J.

'''[[Venezuelan people|Venezuelans]] in [[Spain]]''' form one of the main immigrant groups from [[Hispanic America]] in the country. Spain is the [[Europe]]an country to which most Venezuelans choose to migrate because of the language, family ties and shared customs. As all Latin Americans, Venezuelans who emigrate are allowed to gain Spanish citizenship, within three years due to their Spanish ancestry. In addition, Venezuelans who are children or grandchildren of Spanish citizens can legally obtain Spanish citizenship from their countries of origin, an option open to over 3 million Venezuelans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.elmundo.com.ve/noticias/actualidad/noticias/se-reducen-54--permisos-de-trabajo-a-venezolanos-e.aspx |title=Se reducen 54% permisos de trabajo a venezolanos en España |author=[[El Mundo (Venezuela)|El Mundo]] |language=Spanish |accessdate=21 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
As one of the former Spanish colonies in the Americas and a major destination of Spanish emigration up until the second half of the 20th century, Venezuela shares strong ties with Spain.

After Venezuela underwent a transition to a populist fascism camouflaged as socialism which then was imposed as comunism by the government under [[Hugo Chavez]] in the 1990s, many Venezuelans emigrated to avoid prosecution under the Chavez regime. Some estimated 100,000 Venezuelans settled in Madrid. They assimilated well into Spanish society as they spoke Spanish and Venezuela was a former Spanish colony.

'''Vijay Deverakonda''' is an [[Indian people|Indian]] film actor known for his works in [[Telugu cinema]].&lt;ref name=c&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/todays-paper/tp-features/tp-metroplus/this-film-came-at-the-right-time/article6902995.ece|title=‘This film came at the right time’|website=thehindu.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vijay made his film debut in 2011 with [[Ravi Babu]]'s romantic comedy ''[[Nuvvila]]'' (2011), but he gained recognition with his supporting role in the coming-of-age drama ''[[Yevade Subramanyam]]'' (2015).  

Vijay gained stardom by playing the lead role in the 2016 blockbuster romantic comedy ''[[Pelli Choopulu]]'', which won the [[National Film Award for Best Feature Film in Telugu]] and the [[Filmfare Award for Best Film - Telugu]]. Vijay has since starred in lead roles in critical and commercial successes such as ''[[Arjun Reddy]]'' (2017), ''[[Mahanati]]'' (2018), ''[[Geetha Govindam]]'' (2018), and ''[[Taxiwaala]]'' (2018), some of which rank among the [[list of highest-grossing Telugu films]]. His performance in ''[[Arjun Reddy]]'' won him several accolades, including the [[Filmfare Award for Best Actor - Telugu]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/vijay-sai-deverakonda-telugu-cinema-arjun-reddy-sandeep-reddy-vanga/1/1052913.html|title=Serial kisser Deverakonda is the Emraan Hashmi of Telugu cinema}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=a&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_pqngUO_pP4|title=Yevade Subramanyam Theatrical Trailer - Nani, Malavika Nair|first=|last=Vyjayanthi Network|date=15 January 2015|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vijay has established himself as one of the leading stars in [[Telugu cinema]], and he affectionately refers to his fans as "Rowdies".

== Career ==

===Early career and struggle (2011-2015)===
Deverakonda made his film debut by playing a cricketer opposite [[Yami Gautam]] in  Ravi Babu's romantic comedy [[Nuvvila]] in 2011,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gulte.com/movienews/52556/Ravi-Babu-to-Direct-Vijay-Deverakonda|title=Ravi Babu with Vijay Deverakonda?|website=gulte.com|accessdate=10 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and then had a small cameo role in [[Sekhar Kammula]]'s ''[[Life Is Beautiful (2012 film)|Life is Beautiful]]''. Both films were decently successful but failed to give Deverakonda much recognition.&lt;ref name=h&gt;{{cite web|url=http://movies.ndtv.com/regional/shekhar-kammulas-telugu-film-life-is-beautiful-pushed-to-september-14-607260|title=NDTV Movies: Regional-Movies - Tamil Movies - Telugu Movies - Bengali Movies - Latest Movie News - Celebrity Gossip|website=movies.ndtv.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Then, he was introduced to an assistant director at the time, Nag Ashwin, who later cast him in a supporting role for the 2015 movie ''[[Yevade Subramanyam]]'' alongside actor [[Nani (actor)|Nani]].&lt;ref name=i&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thehindu.com/features/metroplus/an-eye-for-story/article6874716.ece|title=An eye for story|website=thehindu.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was produced by the daughters of [[Ashwini Dutt]], a producer in the Telugu film industry. [[Priyanka Dutt]] backed him, and once shooting started, Swapna Dutt signed him onto her company.&lt;ref name=j&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oSstKbH8NQg|title=Swapna Dutt Speech - Yevade Subramanyam Audio Launch Live - Nani, Malavika Nair|first=|last=Vyjayanthi Network|date=21 February 2015|publisher=|accessdate=30 August 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=k&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.radiokhushi.com/news/details/1501/Evade-Subramanyam-says-Nani|title='Evade Subramanyam' says Nani|first=|last=Radiokhushi|website=www.radiokhushi.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film went on to be a critical and commercial success, and Deverakonda won high praise for his diction, energy, and role in the movie. This movie finally gave him a much-desired break in [[Telugu language|Telugu]] cinema.&lt;ref name=l&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.greatandhra.com/movies/reviews/yevade-subramanyam-review-yes-he-is-worth-the-find-64844.html|title='Yevade Subramanyam' Review: Yes, He Is Worth The Find|website=greatandhra.com|accessdate=30 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Success and stardom (2015-present)===
Vijay's first lead role was in ''[[Pelli Choopulu]]'', a romantic coming-of-age entertainer directed by [[Tharun Bhascker Dhaassyam]], with [[Ritu Varma]] as the female lead.

The '''Zo people''' is the name of the tribes living in the [[Chin State|Chin]] area. Those who come from the Zomi{{clarify|date=October 2018}} area are considered [[wikt:highlander|highlanders]]). There are many different subgroups of Zo, such as the [[Mizo people|'''Mizo''']], the [[Kuki people|'''Kuki''']], the [[Chin people|'''Chin''']] and a number of other names, who are part of a large group of related [[Tibeto-Burman]] peoples spread throughout northwest [[Myanmar]] and the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]] of Bangladesh. In northeastern India, they inhabit the states of [[Nagaland]], [[Mizoram]], [[Meghalaya]], [[Manipur]] and [[Assam]]. This dispersal across international borders resulted from a [[British Raj|British colonial policy]] that drew borders on political grounds rather than ethnic ones.&lt;ref&gt;T. Haokip, 'The Kuki Tribes of Meghalaya: A Study of their Socio-Political Problems', in S.R. Padhi (Ed.). ''[https://www.academia.edu/4392866/The_Kuki_Tribes_of_Meghalaya_A_Study_of_their_Socio-Political_Problems Current Tribal Situation: Strategies for Planning, Welfare and Sustainable Development]''. Delhi: Mangalam Publications, 2013, p. 85.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Zomi people have typical Tibeto-Burman features and are generally of short stature with straight black hair and dark brown eyes. Natively, the Zo speak one of the fifty or so languages that linguists call the [[Kuki-Chin languages|Kuki-Chin language group]], which is also known as Kuki-Chin (Kuki/Chin), Mizo/Kuki/Chin, or Kuki Naga.

==Names==

Various names have been used for the Zomi peoples, but the individual groups generally acknowledge descent from ancestral Zomi. Among the more prominent names given to this group are "Chin" and "Lushai", generally in Myanmar, and "Mizo" and "Kuki", generally in India.

In the literature, the term ''Kuki'' first appeared in the writings of Rawlins when he wrote about the tribes of the [[Chittagong Hill Tracts]]. It referred to a "wild tribe" comprising numerous clans. These clans shared a common past, culture, customs and tradition. They spoke in dialects that had a common root language belonging to the Tibeto-Burman group.&lt;ref&gt;Grierson (1909), ''Linguistic Survey of India'', Vol. III, Tibeto-Burman Family, General Introduction, Specimens of the Tibetan Dialects, The Himalayan Dialects and The North Assam Group, Pt. II, with Grierson (1903), Specimens of the Bodo, Naga and Kachin Groups, Pt. III, Grierson (1904) Specimens of the Kuki, Chin and Burma Groups.&lt;/ref&gt;

The origin of the name "Chin" is uncertain. Later the British used the compound term "Chin-Kuki-Mizo" to group the Kukish language speaking people, and the Government of India inherited this.&lt;ref&gt;Violence and identity in North-east India: Naga-Kuki conflict - Page 201 S. R. Tohring - 2010 "... for these tribes including • the Kuki/ speaking tribe such as: 'Chin', 'Mizo', 'Chin-Kuki-Mizo', 'CHIKIM', 'Zomi', 'Zou', 'Zo'. ... During the British era, the British rulers used the term 'Chin-Kuki-Mizo' and the Government of India seemed to follow ..."&lt;/ref&gt; Missionaries chose to employ the term Chin to christen those on the Burmese side and the term Kuki on the Indian side of the border.&lt;ref&gt;Sachchidananda, R. R. Prasad -''Encyclopaedic profile of Indian tribes''- Page 530 1996&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Pradip Chandra Sarma, ''Traditional Customs and Rituals of Northeast India: Arunachal ... '' Page 288 Vivekananda Kendra Institute of Culture "chose to employ the term Chin to christen those on the Burmese side and the term Kuki on the Indian side of the ...

Beginning in the 1990s, the generic names Chin and Kuki have been rejected by some for "Zomi", a name used by several small groups speaking Northern Kukish languages, including the [[Zomi people|Zomi]].&lt;ref&gt;History of Zomi T. Gougin - 1984 "In Burma the people like to renounce the term Chin in favour of Zomi. Zomi is becoming more and more popular in Churachandpur district of Manipur adjoining the Chin State of Burma as group identity in repudiating Chin and Kuki. The term ..."&lt;/ref&gt; The speakers of the Northern Kukish languages are sometimes lumped together as the [[Gangte people]]. Some [[Zomi nationalism|Zomi nationalists]] have stated that the use of the label Chin would mean subtle domination by Burmese groups.&lt;ref&gt;B. Datta-Ray ''Tribal identity and tension in north-east India'' Page 34 1989 "Now to accept the term Chin would mean subtle Paite domination in the matter, which the other groups like the Hmars, Zous, Anals and Koms may not coopt. A Zomi leader categorically stated that 'Chin' is a Burmese word which literally ..."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Keat Gin Ooi -  Southeast Asia: A Historical Encyclopedia, from Angkor Wat to East ... - Volume 1 - Page 353 2004 "Until recently, there appeared to be a consensus that the term Chin was not an identity that any of these peoples would choose to describe themselves, ... Some promote the terms Zomi and Zo, stating that they are derived from the name of the mythic common ancestor of all ..."&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Mizo", incorporated in the name of the Indian state Mizoram, was also rejected by the [[Zomi National Congress]].&lt;ref&gt;Ramamoorthy Gopalakrishnan - ''Socio-political framework in North-East India '' Page 149 1996 "Later, the term 'Mizo' created a lot of confusion particularly when the Zomi(Newly formed) National Congress emerged. ... But the problem arose with the use of the term 'Chin' (it is not given due recognition in the List of Scheduled Tribes in Manipur)."&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chin Kho Lian Guite - ''Politico-economic development of the tribals of Manipur: a study ... '' Page 8 1999 "Conceptual Meaning and Various Interpretations of the Terms— Chin, Kuki and Mizo (a) Chin The term Chin is the name given to this Zomi/Zomi tribes (formerly known as Chin-Kuki-Mizo) group of people in Myanmar (Burma).
