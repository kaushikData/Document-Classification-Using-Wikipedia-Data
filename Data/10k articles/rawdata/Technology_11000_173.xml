'''2,4,5-Trichlorophenoxyacetic acid''' (also known as '''2,4,5-T'''), a synthetic [[auxin]], is a chlorophenoxy acetic acid [[herbicide]] used to [[Defoliant|defoliate]] broad-leafed plants. It was developed in the late 1940s and was widely used in the agricultural industry until being phased out, starting in the late 1970s due to toxicity concerns. [[Agent Orange]], a defoliant used by the British in the [[Malayan Emergency]] and the U.S. in the [[Vietnam War]], was equal parts 2,4,5-T and [[2,4-D]] (2,4-dichlorophenoxyacetic acid). 2,4,5-T itself is toxic with a [[NOAEL]] of 3&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day and a [[LOAEL]] of 10&amp;nbsp;mg/kg/day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The US-Malaysian nexus: Themes in superpower-small state relations |pages=284–290 |publisher=Institute of Strategic and International Studies, Malaysia |author=Pamela Sodhy |year=1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{mcn|date=January 2015}} Additionally, the manufacturing process for 2,4,5-T contaminates this chemical with trace amounts of  [[2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-p-dioxin|2,3,7,8-tetrachlorodibenzo-''p''-dioxin]] (TCDD). TCDD is a [[carcinogenic]] [[persistent organic pollutant]] with long-term effects on the environment.  With proper temperature control during production of 2,4,5-T, TCDD levels can be held to about .005 ppm.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}  Before the TCDD risk was well understood, early production facilities lacked proper temperature controls and individual batches tested later were found to have as much as 60 ppm of TCDD.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

In 1970, the [[United States Department of Agriculture]] halted the use of 2,4,5-T on all food crops except rice, and in 1985, the [[EPA]] terminated all remaining uses in the U.S. of this herbicide. In Canada, the use and sale of 2,4,5-T was prohibited after 1985.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Backgrounder: 2,4,5-T Use in Ontario|url=https://news.ontario.ca/mnr/en/2013/06/245-t-use-in-ontario.html|accessdate=9 March 2018|publisher=Ministry of Natural Resources and Forestry|date=13 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The international trade of 2,4,5-T is restricted by the [[Rotterdam Convention]]. 2,4,5-T has since largely been replaced by [[dicamba]] and [[triclopyr]].

Human health effects from 2,4,5-T at low environmental doses or at biomonitored levels from low environmental exposures are unknown. Intentional overdoses and unintentional high dose occupational exposures to chlorophenoxy acid herbicides have resulted in weakness, headache, dizziness, nausea, abdominal pain, myotonia, hypotension, renal and hepatic injury, and delayed neuropathy.{{mcn|date=January 2015}}.

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1963 a production vessel for 2,4,5-T exploded in the Philips-Duphar plant in the Netherlands. Six workers that cleaned up afterwards got seriously intoxicated and developed [[chloracne]]. After twelve years, four of the six cleaners had died.

[[File:Absorber.svg|thumb|250px|Laboratory absorber. '''1a)''': CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; inlet; '''1b)''': H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O inlet; '''2)''': outlet '''3)''': absorption column; '''4)''': packing.]]

In [[chemistry]], '''absorption''' is a physical or chemical [[phenomenon]] or a [[Process (science)|process]] in which [[atom]]s, [[molecules]] or [[ion]]s enter some bulk phase – [[liquid]] or [[solid]] material. This is a different process from [[adsorption]], since molecules undergoing absorption are taken up by the volume, not by the surface (as in the case for adsorption). A more general term is ''[[sorption]]'', which covers absorption, [[adsorption]], and [[ion exchange]]. Absorption is a condition in which something takes in another substance.&lt;ref name=Organic-chemistry/&gt;

In many processes important in technology, the chemical absorption is used in place of the physical process, e.g., absorption of carbon dioxide by sodium hydroxide – such acid-base processes do not follow the Nernst partition law.

For some examples of this effect, see [[liquid-liquid extraction]]. It is possible to extract from one [[liquid]] phase to another a [[Solution|solute]] without a chemical reaction. Examples of such solutes are [[noble gases]] and [[osmium tetroxide]].&lt;ref name=Organic-chemistry&gt;
{{cite book|last = McMurry|first = John|title = Fundamentals of Organic Chemistry
|edition = Fifth|publisher = Agnus McDonald|year = 2003
|pages = 409|isbn = 0-534-39573-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of absorption means that a substance captures and transforms energy. The absorbent distributes the material it captures throughout whole and adsorbent only distributes it through the surface.

The process of gas or liquid which penetrate into the body of adsorbent is commonly known as absorption.

{{Quote box
| title = [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry|IUPAC]] definition
| quote = '''Absorption: The process of one material (absorbate) being retained by another (absorbent); this may be the physical solution of a gas, liquid, or solid in a liquid, attachment of molecules of a gas, vapour, liquid, or dissolved substance to a solid surface by physical forces, etc. In spectrophotometry, absorption of light at characteristic wavelengths or bands of wavelengths is used to identify the chemical nature of molecules, atoms or ions and to measure the concentrations of these species. }} 

==Equation==
If absorption is a physical process not accompanied by any other physical or chemical process, it usually follows the '''[[distribution law|Nernst distribution law]]''': 
:"the ratio of concentrations of some solute species in two bulk phases when it is equilibrium and in contact is constant for a given solute and bulk phases":
:: &lt;math&gt;\frac{[x]_{1}}{[x]_{2}} = \text{constant} = K_{N(x,12)}&lt;/math&gt;

The value of constant K&lt;sub&gt;N&lt;/sub&gt; depends on temperature and is called '''[[partition coefficient]]'''. This equation is valid if concentrations are not too large and if the species "x" does not change its form in any of the two phases "1" or "2". If such molecule undergoes association or [[Dissociation (chemistry)|dissociation]] then this equation still describes the equilibrium between "x" in both phases, but only for the same form – concentrations of all remaining forms must be calculated by taking into account all the other equilibria.&lt;ref name=Organic-chemistry/&gt;

In the case of gas absorption, one may calculate its concentration by using, e.g., the [[Ideal gas law]], c = p/RT. In alternative fashion, one may use [[partial pressure]]s instead of concentrations.

==Types of absorption==
Absorption is a process that may be chemical (reactive) or physical (non-reactive). 

=== Chemical absorption ===
Chemical absorption or reactive absorption is a chemical reaction between the absorbed and the absorbing substances. Sometimes it combines with physical absorption. This type of absorption depends upon the [[stoichiometry]] of the reaction and the concentration of its reactants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Leiviskä|first=Tiina|author2=Gehör, Seppo|author3=Eijärvi, Erkki|author4=Sarpola, Arja|author5=Tanskanen, Juha|title=Characteristics and potential applications of coarse clay fractions from Puolanka, Finland |journal=Central European Journal of Engineering|date=10 April 2012|volume=2|issue=2|pages=239–247|doi=10.2478/s13531-011-0067-9|bibcode=2012CEJE....2..239L}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Physical absorption ===

==== Water in a solid ====
[[Hydrophile|Hydrophilic]] solids, which includes many solids of biological origin, can readily absorb water.  [[Chemical polarity|Polar]] interactions between water and the molecules of the solid favour partition of the water into the solid, which can allow significant absorption of water vapour even in relatively low humidity.  

===== Moisture regain =====
A plant fibre (or other hydrophilic material) that has been exposed to the atmosphere will usually contain some water even if it feels dry.  The water can be driven off by heating in an oven, leading to a measurable decrease in weight, which will gradually be regained if the fibre is returned to a 'normal' atmosphere.  This effect is important in the textile industry, where the proportion of a material's weight made up by water is called the ''moisture regain''. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cameo.mfa.org/wiki/Moisture_regain|title=Moisture regain - CAMEO|website=cameo.mfa.org|language=en|access-date=2018-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Advanced Technology Leisure Application Simulator''', or '''ATLAS''', is a large [[hydraulic]] [[motion simulator]]. It was designed, as the name implies, for the theme park industry. The ATLAS is a product of Rediffusion Simulation&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Peltz|first1=James F.|title=Hughes Agrees to Sell Flight Simulator Unit|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-11-25/business/fi-60803_1_flight-simulator|accessdate=August 24, 2014|date=November 25, 1993}}&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Sussex]], [[England]], now owned by [[Thales Group]] and known as [[Thales Training &amp; Simulation]]. Disney filed multiple patents on their variant of the device, including US Utility Patent #5161104 [https://www.google.com/patents/US5161104].

The ATLAS was derived from military flight simulation technology. It uses six hydraulic actuators to provide a broad range of movement.

In the later half of the 1980s, [[Walt Disney Imagineering]] bought and refined this technology for two theme park attractions; [[Star Tours]] at [[Disneyland]] (and later [[Disney's Hollywood Studios]], [[Tokyo Disneyland]], and [[Disneyland Paris]]) and [[Body Wars]] at [[Epcot]]. The technology was also used in 2016 for the [[Iron Man Experience]] at [[Hong Kong Disneyland]]. The Disney attractions feature large, 40-person cabins hidden from outside view, arranged lengthwise with four or six simulators per installation. There are four simulators at Disneyland's Star Tours and EPCOT's Body Wars, while the remaining Star Tours installations have six. Body Wars is now defunct and the simulators have been removed from the building in the years since the closure of the [[Wonders of Life]] pavilion.

'''Advanced meat recovery''' ('''AMR''') is a [[slaughterhouse]] deboning process by which the last traces of skeletal muscle [[meat]] are removed from animal bones after the [[primal cut]]s have been carved off manually.

The machinery used in this process separates meat from bone by scraping, shaving, or pressing the meat from the bone without breaking or grinding the bone. Products produced by advanced meat recovery machinery can be labeled using terms associated with hand-deboned product (i.e., "[[beef]]", "[[pork]]", "beef trimmings", etc.). AMR meat typically is used as an ingredient in products requiring further processing, such as [[hot dog]]s.

This meat is comparable in appearance, texture, and composition to meat trimmings and similar meat products derived by hand.

[[USDA]] regulations for procurement of frozen fresh ground beef products state that "Beef that is mechanically separated from bone with automatic deboning systems, advanced lean (meat) recovery (AMR) systems or powered knives, will not be allowed".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.mindfully.org/Food/2003/Irradiated-Beef-Schools-USDA30may03.htm |title=USDA Purchases of Ground Beef Items Frozen Technical Requirements Schedule – GB-2003 / USDA 29may03 |access-date=2009-10-15 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20030608042601/http://www.mindfully.org/Food/2003/Irradiated-Beef-Schools-USDA30may03.htm |archive-date=2003-06-08 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Regulation in the United States==
In the [[United States]], [[United States Department of Agriculture|USDA]] regulations stipulate that AMR machinery cannot grind, crush, or pulverize bones to remove edible meat tissue, and bones must emerge intact. The meat produced in this manner can contain no more than 150(±30) milligrams of [[calcium]] per 200 grams product,&lt;ref name="USDA Regulations 1"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.fsis.usda.gov/OPPDE/rdad/FRPubs/03-038IF.pdf |title=USDA Regulations |access-date=2007-05-01 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170125075300/https://www.fsis.usda.gov/OPPDE/rdad/FRPubs/03-038if.pdf |archive-date=2017-01-25 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; as calcium in such high concentrations in the product would be indicative of bone being mixed with the meat. Products that exceed the calcium content limit must instead be labeled "[[Mechanically separated meat|mechanically separated beef or pork]]" in the ingredients statement.

In 1994, the [[Food Safety and Inspection Service]] (FSIS) issued a rule allowing such meat to be labeled as meat for human consumption, providing that the bones from which it was removed were still intact after processing. In 1997, following tests indicating that central nervous system (CNS) tissue was showing up in mechanically removed meat, FSIS issued a directive to its inspectors instructing them to ensure that spinal cord tissue was removed from bones before the AMR process. Following the identification of a [[Bovine spongiform encephalopathy|BSE]]-infected U.S. dairy cow in December 2003, FSIS issued new regulations expanding the definition of prohibited CNS tissue to include additional cattle parts. Furthermore, all AMR-processed product from cattle more than 30 months old now is prohibited from being used for food, and such product from younger cattle and from other
livestock species also is prohibited if it contains CNS material.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf CRS Report for Congress: Agriculture: A Glossary of Terms, Programs, and Laws, 2005 Edition - Order Code 97-905] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110212033139/http://ncseonline.org/nle/crsreports/05jun/97-905.pdf |date=2011-02-12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The USDA's AMR guidelines restrict the processing of the parts of cattle that may contain central nervous tissue from AMR systems in cattle over 30 months of age. However, non-CNS tissue meat can be processed and is considered meat, as are the muscle cuts. Although some sources claim AMR systems use [[ammonia]] (or anhydrous ammonia, ammonia hydroxide, etc.) to treat the meat, this appears to be due to confusion between AMR and the production of lean finely textured beef (LFTB, commonly referred to as [[pink slime]]).{{cn|date=August 2016}} LFTB is in fact treated with ammonia,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.beefproducts.com/ammonium_hydroxide.php |title=Beef Products, Inc. - Ammonium Hydroxide |access-date=2012-12-27 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170804210314/http://beefproducts.com/ammonium_hydroxide.php |archive-date=2017-08-04 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; and so is substantially more restricted than most AMR products.

==Regulation in Europe==
In 2012, the European Commission changed the classification of desinewed meat (DSM) so that it could no longer be called 'meat' but must be included in the category of [[mechanically recovered meat]] (MRM). The downgrade of DSM took effect in the UK in May 2012. Unlike other types of MRM, which have the appearance of a paste, DSM resembled minced meat and was previously sold in the UK as 'meat'.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.food.gov.uk/news-updates/news/2012/apr/dsm#.URuJLGeDrP4 ''Moratorium on desinewed meat'', Food Standards Agency, 2012-04-04, accessed 2013-02-13]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alfons Rissberger''' (born May 25, 1948 in [[Worms, Germany|Worms]]) is a [[Germany|German]] [[Entrepreneurship|entrepreneur]], [[business consultant]] and [[author]] as well as initiator and founding board member of, the biggest initiative between politics and economy for Germany's digital future.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://magazin.spiegel.de/EpubDelivery/spiegel/pdf/13685786|title="Moderne Analphabeten"|format=PDF|date=1994|website=[[Der Spiegel]]|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Life ==
Since 43 years Rissberger has been a consultant for politics and economy with a focus on success and efficiency in the IT-age, especially regarding IT usage in management and education. In 1987 he was the first German scientist who was responsible for a model experiment by the Federal-State-Commission for education management and research support (BLK)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blk-bonn.de/blk-rueckblick.htm|title=Die BLK: Rückblick auf 37 Jahre im Dienst von Bund und Ländern|website=Bund-Länder-Kommission|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; which looked at e-learning at an elementary school. 
From 1985 until 1993 Rissberger was responsible for IT basic education (ITG) and [[Educational technology|e-learning]] in the educational system of the [[Rhineland-Palatinate]] ministry of education and cultural affairs. From 1993 until 2005 he was managing director of DVZ Datenverarbeitungszentrums Mecklenburg-Vorpommern GmbH (data processing center) and since that time he owns the business Rissberger Strategie Consulting in [[Hamburg]] and [[Schwerin]].

He is married for the second time. He has two children with his first wife.

After an apprenticeship in television technology-craftsmanship he studied electrical engineering, computer sciences and vocational education - with a focus on educational psychology and political sciences – in [[Goethe University Frankfurt|Frankfurt]] and [[Technische Universität Darmstadt|Darmstadt]]. He holds a diploma in engineering and completed the first and second state examination in vocational education.

As son of a locksmith he financed his studies by working as a night cargo workman at [[Frankfurt Airport]] and by setting up informatics-course-systems at the community colleges [[Höchst (Frankfurt am Main)|Frankfurt-Höchst]] and Worms, his hometown. The concept of these informatics-courses was the foundation for recommendations by the [[Gesellschaft für Informatik]] ("German Informatics Society") and by the Deutsche Volkshochschul-Verband e.V. ("German Community Collage Union") for vocational education.

From 1970 until 1991 he pursued teaching and leading activities in the school and college domain as well as in the area of advanced training of executive managers in the economy. His focus was applied informatics; among others from 1979 until 1991 as college professor in the areas informatics, trade, foreign business, taxation and tourism at the University of Applied Sciences of the state Rhineland-Palatinate, located in Worms. He lectured for 10 years at the BASF-Führungskolleg at the University Seminary of Economy in the water castle Gracht in Liblar near [[Cologne]].

Since 1974 Rissberg is consultant for politics and economy with an emphasis on success and efficiency in the IT-age. He is surveyor at the Enquete-Komission ''Deutschlands Weg in die Informationsgesellschaft'' (Enquete-Commission Germany's path to an information society) of the German [[Bundestag]], he is a member of the science advisory council of the [[Konrad Adenauer Foundation]], he is initiator and chairman of the Mecklenburg-Vorpommern multimedia advisory council, he is leader and initiator of various research projects in the area of e-learning, he is initiator and author of television and video productions as well as initiator and author of textbooks and numerous other publications.

From 1985 until 1993 Rissberger headed up the department for new information and communication technologies at the Ministry of Education, Science and Advanced Training Rheinland-Pfalz in Mainz. He was responsible for the introduction of IT basic education in secondary education in all public schools within the state. He is also editor of the first German IT basic education schoolbook published by Klett-Verlag. Rissberger was initiator and leader of a number of German and European first-time BLK-model-experiments in the area of e-learning. He is idea generator for new school formats (such as the technical collage for informatics) and for new vocational training areas.

In 1994 he was initiator of the Berlin memorandum Aktiver Lernen: Multimedia für eine bessere Bildung (active learning: multimedia for a better education).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/spiegel/print/d-13685786.html|title= Schulen "Moderne Analphabeten"|date=1994-11-28|website=[[Der Spiegel]]|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1999 he was idea generator and founding board member of Initiative D21 with chancellor [[Gerhard Schröder]] as chairman of the advisory council.

From 2001 until 2005 Rissberger was founder and managing director of DVZ Consulting GmbH in Schwerin.

In 2001 Rissberger had demanded a focused national project "e-learning in the German-speaking educational system" with a concept for the first virtual University in Germany "VirtuS- Virtual University Schwerin",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rissberger.de/pages/uni-projekt.html|title=VirtUS - Virtuelle Universität Schwerin|date=2001-10-23|website=Rissberger Strategie Consulting|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tu-dresden.de/bu/wirtschaft/wiim/ressourcen/dateien/dateien/counsel/VirtusD_Memorandum.pdf?lang=de|title=Berliner Memorandum "VirtusD Virtuelle Universität Deutschland - E-Learning für eine bessere Bildung an den Hochschulen"|date=2007-01-13|website=[[TU Dresden]]|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rissberger.de/pdf/VirtuS_Konzept_2012.pdf|title=(Vorläufiges) Endergebnis Ende 2012|format=PDF|date=2012|website=Rissberger Strategie Consulting|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the project did not yet come about (effective: 2016).

In 2007 he was initiator and co-editor of the Berlin memorandum "VirtusD Virtuelle Universität Deutschland – E-Learning für eine bessere Bildung an den Hochschulen" (VirtusD Virtual University Germany – e-learning for a better education at Universities).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pro-physik.de/details/news/1119175/Memorandum_fuer_virtuelle_Universitaet.html|title=Memorandum für virtuelle Universität|date=2007-01-11|website=[[Physik Journal]]|access-date=2018-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 2006 he owns Rissberger Strategie Consulting in Hamburg and Schwerin.

Since 1976 he is a [[Social democracy|social democrat]] and was party leader and fraction speaker in his former hometown Worms-Horchheim.

'''Anidolic lighting systems''' use [[nonimaging optics|anidolic optical components]] to light rooms. Light redirected by these systems does not converge to a [[Focus (optics)|focal point]] or form an image,&lt;ref&gt;Chaves, p. 72&lt;/ref&gt; whence the name (from ''an'', without, and ''eidolon'', image&lt;ref name=S14/&gt;).

Anidolic lighting uses non-imaging mirrors, lenses, and [[Waveguide_(optics)|light guides]] to capture exterior [[sunlight]] and direct it deeply into rooms, while also scattering rays to avoid glare. The human eye's response to light [[Weber–Fechner law#Vision|is non-linear]], so a more even distribution of the same amount of light makes a room appear brighter.

It is most challenging to effectively capture and redistribute of light on cloudy, overcast days,&lt;ref name=S14&gt;Scartezzini, p. 14&lt;/ref&gt; when the [[Diffuse_sky_radiation|sunlight is diffuse]].

==Optical elements==
Mirrors are typically [[parabolic reflector|parabolic]] or [[ellipse|elliptical]] mirrors. Lenses are frequently made in multiple sections, like a [[Fresnel lens]]. Light guides include [[light pipe]]s and anidolic ceilings.

==Lens systems==
{{main|Prism lighting}}
&lt;!-- [[File:Half-prism tile.svg|thumb|left|How light is bent by a single prism (a prism tile has many prisms)]] Need to fix mistake; incoming beams don't refract!--&gt;
Lens systems use reflection and refraction within [[optical prism]]s to redirect daylight. Some forms of prims lighting have been used for centuries, and others are 21st-century.

[[Deck prism]]s were set into the upper decks of ships to light the decks below. [[Pavement lights]] were set into floors or sidewalks to let light into a basement below. The underside was frequently extended into prisms to direct and spread the light.&lt;ref name=glassian/&gt;

[[Prism tile]]s were designed to bend sunbeams coming through a window upwards, so that they would reach deeper into a room. They were placed in the upper parts of window frames, where they were called "transom lights".&lt;ref name=glassian&gt;

==Mirror systems==
[[File:Zenithal anidolic example 1.jpg|thumb|left|200px|right|Basic zenithal daylighting arrangement. An external parabolic or [[ellipse|elliptical]] mirror captures [[zenith]]al daylight, and converges it, to let it pass through a narrow opening in the exterior wall. On the inside, two parabolic mirrors widen the beam to around 60°. The floor area next to the conventional window is lit by the window.]]

Anidolic mirror lighting systems can be divided into three parts:
* daylight capture, usually with [[zenith]]al light [[Concentrating solar power|collector]]
* optimal transmission of the light (via anidolic ceilings, [[light tube]]s, etc.)
* distribution of captured light to target areas inside the rooms

Architectural design also require optimal integration into the building [[facade]].&lt;ref name=S14/&gt; 

===Collection===
Typically, light is captured with a [[Non-imaging optics#Compound parabolic concentrator|compound parabolic collector]] (CPC) or elliptical collector (CEC) mounted on the exterior wall. These mirrors provide a wide and even collection pattern. The vertical capture angle approaches 90 degrees, from the [[horizon]] to the vertical plane of the supporting wall. An even capture pattern alleviates the need for a [[solar tracker]]: a permanently fixed anidolic collector remains effective at any time of day.&lt;ref&gt;Chaves, p. 146&lt;/ref&gt; 

External parabolic collectors require proper [[heat insulation]] (usually double-glazed windows over the zenithal opening) and [[roller blinds]] to reduce excessive lighting, glare and heat on sunny days.&lt;ref name=S14/&gt;

Snow and weatherproofing are also a consideration.

===Transmission===
[[File:Solatube 160 DS rafter cutaway.jpg|thumb|A simple [[light tube]], showing collection, transmission, and distribution]]

Unlike the industrial [[parabolic trough]]s used in [[Concentrating solar power|solar concentrator]]s, architectural CPC mirrors do not concentrate captured light into a single [[Focus (optics)|focal point]] or focal line (which creates a [[fire hazard]]). Instead, light is directed into the building through a relatively wide opening.

===Distribution===
A second CPC or CEC mirror acting as an angle transformer&lt;ref&gt;See Chaves, pp.75, for a discussion on angle transformer properties.&lt;/ref&gt; disperses this beam into a wide-angle, diffused pattern. If it transmits light from a wide external CPC, a light tube actually becomes a flat ''anidolic ceiling''.&lt;ref name=S14/&gt; 

===Architectural integration===
''Integrated anidolic systems'' reduce external protrusion and attempt to visually blend into traditional facades. However, like other anidolic systems, they are susceptible to glare and offer no protection from overheating on sunny days.&lt;ref&gt;Scartezzini, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

===Example===
For example, the external CPC in the reference lights a 6-metre deep room. It protrudes 0.67 metres from the exterior wall and employs a 3.6 metre long, 0.5 meter tall [[light tube]], followed by a 0.9 metre long interior CPC, to deliver captured light into the back of the room.&lt;ref name=S14/&gt; This arrangement provided 32% energy savings over a six-month period compared to a reference facade.&lt;ref name=S14/&gt;

'''Automatic Tracking Satellite Dishes''' are [[satellite dish]]es used while a vehicle is in motion. Automatic tracking satellite dishes utilize [[gyroscopes]], [[GPS]] position sensors, and uses unique satellite identification data and an integrated [[Digital Video Broadcasting|DVB]] decoder to aid in identification of the satellite that it is pointing at.

The dishes consist usually of [[stepper motor]]s to drive and aim the dish, [[gyroscopes]] to detect changes in position while the vehicle is in motion, a [[parabolic reflector]], [[low-noise block converter]], and control unit.

[[File:Garbage bag Basel Bebbisagg.JPG|thumb|Official waste disposal bag from [[Basel]], Switzerland]]

A '''bag''' (also known regionally as a '''sack''') is a common [[tool]] in the form of a non-rigid [[container]]. The use of bags predates [[recorded history]], with the earliest bags being no more than lengths of animal skin, [[cotton]], or woven plant fibers, folded up at the edges and secured in that shape with strings of the same material.&lt;ref name="Chenoune"&gt;Farid Chenoune, ''Carried Away: All About Bags'' (2005).&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their simplicity, bags have been fundamental for the [[Civilization|development of human civilization]], as they allow people to easily collect loose materials such as [[berry|berries]] or [[food grains]], and to transport more items than could readily be carried in the [[hand]]s.&lt;ref name="Chenoune"/&gt; The word probably has its origins in the [[Old Norse language|Norse]] word ''baggi'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sprakrad.no|title=Språkrådet|publisher=|accessdate=3 December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; from the reconstructed [[Proto-Indo-European]] bʰak, but is also comparable to the [[Welsh language|Welsh]] baich (load, bundle), and the [[Greek language|Greek]] βάσταγμα (''bástagma'', load).

Cheap [[disposable]] paper bags and [[plastic shopping bag]]s are very common in the retail trade as a convenience for [[shopping|shoppers]], and are often supplied by the shop for free or for a small [[fee]]. Customers may also take their own shopping bags to use in shops. Although, paper had been used for purposes of wrapping and padding in [[ancient China]] since the 2nd century BC,&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 122"&gt;Needham, Volume 4, 122.&lt;/ref&gt; the first use of paper bags (for preserving the flavor of [[tea]]) in China came during the later [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907 AD).&lt;ref name="needham volume 4 122"/&gt;

==History==
Bags have been around for hundreds of years and have been used by both men and women. Bags have been prevalent as far back as [[ancient Egypt]]. Many [[Egyptian hieroglyphs|hieroglyphs]] depict males with bags tied around their waist. The Bible mentions pouches, especially with regard to Judas Iscariot carrying one around, holding his personal items. In the 14th century, wary of pickpockets and thieves, many people used drawstring bags, in which to carry their money. These bags were attached to "girdles" via a long cord fastened to the waist.

Women also wore more ornate drawstring bags, typically called ''hamondeys'' or ''tasques'', to display their social status. The 14th-century handbags evolved into wedding gifts from groom to bride. These medieval pouches were embroidered, often with depictions of love stories or songs. Eventually, these pouches evolved into what is known as a ''chaneries'', which were used for gaming or food for falcons. During the Renaissance, Elizabethan England's fashions were more ornate than ever before. Women's wore their pouches underneath the vast array of petticoats and men wore leather pockets or ''bagges'' inside their breeches. Aristocrats began carrying ''swete bagges'' filled with sweet-smelling material to make up for poor hygiene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The History of Handbags: A Timeline |url=http://www.handbagheaven.com/history-of-handbags.html |website=Handbag Heaven |accessdate=29 July 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140729184927/http://www.handbagheaven.com/history-of-handbags.html |archivedate=29 July 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Modern==
In the modern world, bags are ubiquitous,&lt;ref name="Chenoune"/&gt; with many people routinely carrying a wide variety of them in the form of [[cloth]] or [[leather]] [[briefcase]]s, [[handbag]]s, and [[backpack]]s, and with bags made from more disposable materials such as [[paper]] or [[plastic]] being used for [[shopping]], and to carry home [[groceries]]. A bag may be closable by a [[zipper]], [[snap fastener]], etc., or simply by folding (e.g. in the case of a paper bag). Sometimes a [[money]] bag or travel bag has a [[Lock (security device)|lock]]. The bag likely predates the inflexible variant, the [[basket]], and bags usually have the additional advantage over baskets of being foldable or otherwise compressible to smaller sizes. On the other hand, baskets, being made of a more rigid material, may better protect their contents.

An empty bag may or may not be very light and foldable to a small size. If it is, this is convenient for carrying it to the place where it is needed, such as a shop, and for storage of empty bags. Bags vary from small ones, like [[handbag|purse]]s, to large ones for use in [[travel]]ing like a [[suitcase]]. The [[pocket]]s of [[clothing]] are also a kind of bag, built into the clothing for the carrying of suitably small objects.

==Environmental aspects==
There are environmental concerns regarding use and disposal of plastic shopping and trash bags. Efforts are being taken to control and reduce their use in some [[European Union]] countries, including [[Ireland]] and the [[Netherlands]]. In some cases the cheap bags are taxed so the customer must pay a fee where they may not have done previously. Sometimes heavy duty reusable plastic and fabric bags are sold, typically costing €0.5 to €1, and these may replace disposable bags entirely. Sometimes free replacements are offered when the bag wears out. A notable exception to this trend is the [[UK]], where disposable plastic bags are still freely available and are dominant. This trend has spread to some cities in the United States.

A bag may or may not be [[disposable]]; however, even a disposable bag can often be used many times, for economic and environmental reasons. On the other hand, there may be logistic or hygienic reasons to use a bag only once. For example, a [[garbage bag]] is often disposed of with its content. A bag for packaging a [[disposable product]] is often disposed of when it is empty. Similarly, bags used as receptacles in medical procedures, such as the [[colostomy bag]] used to collect waste from a surgically diverted biological system, are typically disposed of as [[medical waste]]. Many [[snack food]]s, such as [[pretzel]]s, [[cookie]]s, and [[potato chip]]s, are available in disposable single-use sealed bags.

A '''bite indicator''' is a mechanical or electronic device which indicates to an [[angling|angler]] that something is happening at the [[fishing hook|hook]] end of the [[fishing line]].

== Types ==

There are many types of bite indicators. Which ones work best depends on the type of fishing.

* [[Fishing float]]s: widely used as bite indicators.
* [[Quiver tip]]s: attached onto the end of the [[fishing rod]].
* Bite alarms: electronic devices which bleep when a fish tugs a fishing line. The fishing line is wound on a running roller which makes a noise when the fishing line moves, thus alerting the [[angling|angler]] that a fish might be hooked.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.carp.net/faq/cfaq_3.htm#c3_5 Bite indicators]&lt;/ref&gt; They are attached to the fishing rod between the reel and the first eye on the rod, and give an audibly alert when there is a simple movement of the line. Bite alarms can range from simple devices with an on/off switch that do no more than indicate when the line moves over the roller, to more complicated devices with volume, tone and sensitivity controls. They are useful when fishing with more than one rod, and are commonly used when [[coarse fishing]] for [[carp]]. Whereas [[Float (fishing)|floats]] can be used as visual bite detectors, bite alarms are audible bite detectors.  Although more expensive than visual devices, audible devices are popular as they do not require constant monitoring. They were invented by [[Richard Walker (angler)|Richard Walker]].

A '''bucket''' (also called a '''scoop''' to qualify shallower designs of tools) is a specialized container attached to a machine, as compared to a [[bucket]] adapted for manual use by a human being. It is a [[bulk material handling]] component.

The bucket has an inner volume as compared to other types of machine attachments like blades or shovels.

The bucket could be attached to the [[lifting hook]] of a [[Crane (machine)|crane]], at the end of the arm of an [[excavator|excavating machine]], to the wires of a [[dragline excavator]], to the arms of a [[power shovel]] or a [[tractor]] equipped with a [[backhoe loader]] or to a [[Bucket loader|loader]], or to a [[Dredging|dredge]].

The name "bucket" may have been coined from buckets used in [[water wheel]]s, or used in water turbines or in similar-looking devices.

==Purposes==
Buckets in mechanical engineering can have a distinct quality from the traditional bucket (pail) whose purpose is to contain things. Larger versions of this type of bucket equip [[bucket truck]]s to contain human beings, buckets in water-hauling systems in mines or, for instance, in [[helicopter bucket]]s to hold water to combat fires.

Two other types of mechanical buckets can be distinguished according to the final destination of the device they equip: energy-consumer systems like excavators or energy-capturer systems like water bucket wheels or turbines.

==Size and shape==
Buckets exist in a variety of sizes or shapes. They can be quite large like those equipping [[Hulett]] cranes, used to discharge ore out of cargo ships in harbours or very small such as those used by deep-sea exploration vehicles.

The shape of the bucket can vary from the truncated conical shape of an actual bucket to more scoop-like or spoon-like shapes akin to water turbines. The cross section can be round or square.

[[File:Farmington-Mine-Disaster-rescue.jpg|thumb|right|175px|Three miners are extracted during the [[Farmington Mine disaster]], in a bucket attached to a crane]]

==Designs==

===Simple design===
This is the same shape of a domestic form, the one-piece-standing single element, but often with an augmented size.

====Mining====
In early developments of [[mining]], a large simple bucket allowed easy insertion of both miners and construction materials such as [[pit prop]]s, and later extraction of miners and ore. Common terms used in various parts of the world include: Bowk; Kibble; Hoppit; Hoppet. Latterly they have been called sinking buckets, as they are now only used when sinking new mine shafts before insertion of the cage, or for emergency rescue.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://myweb.tiscali.co.uk/coalface/glossary/hterms.htm|title=Coalface terms: H|publisher=Caolface Glossary|accessdate=16 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Concrete bucket====
[[File:Betonkorb.JPG|thumb|180px|right|Concrete bucket on a crane.]]
'''Concrete bucket'''s help deliver concrete on a specific site of a building by the means of a [[tower crane]]. They have a bottom opening to allow concrete to flow out of the bucket when in-place. See also [[tremie]].

====Electrical trucks bucket====
They are placed at the end of an excavator-like arm and have to be made from a material that provides isolation from electricity, like fiber glass, to help the workers protect themselves. There may be a door on the side of the bucket.

===Excavator bucket===
Excavator buckets are made of solid steel and generally present teeth protruding from the cutting edge, to disrupt hard material and avoid wear-and-tear of the bucket. Subsets of the excavator bucket are: the ditching bucket, trenching bucket, A ditching bucket is a wider bucket with no teeth, {{convert|5|-|6|ft|2}} used for excavating larger excavations and grading stone. A trenching excavator bucket is normally {{convert|6|to|24|in|0|abbr=on}} wide and with protruding teeth.

===Clamshell bucket===
[[File:Coal loading shell grabs, Cardiff.jpg|thumb|Clamshell buckets from a retired [[bulk-handling crane|coal-loading crane]], now displayed at a dock re-development in [[Cardiff]]]]
The clamshell bucket is a more sophisticated articulated several-piece device, including two elementary buckets associated on a hinged structure forming a claws-like appendage with an internal volume.

===Buckets-wheel===

====In mining====
The design is used in [[bucket-wheel excavator]]s. The buckets in the wheel have to be made of solid material to withstand the resistance of the material it cuts through.

====In water hoisting====

====In energy production====
The bucket wheel design is also used to capture the water energy in water-wheels or water turbines like [[Pelton wheel]]s. The buckets also have to be made of solid material to withstand the force of the water flow. Their shape is optimized according to their purpose.
Other designs include vertical shaft wind turbines designs like on the [[Savonius wind turbine]]. In this case, the buckets have to be made of a light material.

===Buckets-ladders (buckets-chains)===
The buckets-ladders are used in [[bucket elevator]]s or in the dredge design of some dredgers.

== In rotordynamics ==
[[File:Campbelldiagram.png|thumb|300px|Analytical Campbell Diagram for a Simple Rotor]]
In [[Rotordynamics|rotordynamical]] systems, the eigenfrequencies often depend on the rotation rates due to the induced [[gyroscopic]] effects or variable hydrodynamic conditions in [[fluid bearing]]s. It might represent the following cases:

1. ''Analytically'' computed values of [[eigenfrequency|eigenfrequencies]] as a function of the shaft's rotation speed. This case is also called "whirl speed map".&lt;ref name="Logan"&gt;
{{Cite book

| last = Logan, Earl Jr
| title = Handbook of Turbomachinery (Mechanical Engineering, No. 158)
| date = 2003-05-01
}}&lt;/ref&gt; Such chart can be used in turbine design as shown in the numerically calculated Campbell diagram example illustrated by the image: analysis shows that there are well-damped critical speed at lower speed range. Another critical speed at mode 4 is observed at 7810 rpm (130&amp;nbsp;Hz) in dangerous vicinity of nominal shaft speed, but it has 30% damping - enough to safely ignore it.

[[File:Campbell Diagram.png|thumb|300px|Campbell Diagram of a steam turbine]]

2. ''Experimentally'' measured vibration response spectrum as a function of the shaft's rotation speed ([[waterfall plot]]), the peak locations for each slice usually corresponding to the [[eigenfrequency|eigenfrequencies]].

== In acoustical engineering ==

In [[acoustical engineering]], the Campbell diagram would represent the pressure spectrum [[waterfall plot]] vs the machine's shaft rotation speed (sometimes also called ''3D noise map'').

{{wiktionarypar|changeover}} 
In [[manufacturing]], '''changeover''' is the [[wikt:process|process]] of converting a line or machine from running one product to another. Changeover times can last from a few minutes to as much as several weeks in the case of [[automobile]] manufacturers retooling for new models. The terms ''set-up'' and ''changeover'' are sometimes used interchangeably however this usage is incorrect. Set-up is only one component of changeover. Example: A [[soft drink]] [[bottling|bottler]] may run 16oz glass bottles one day, perform a changeover on the line and then run 20oz plastic bottles the next day.

== The 3 Ups ==
Changeover can be divided into the 3 Ups:

===Clean-up===
''Clean-up [[product (business)|product]], materials and [[wikt:component|component]]s from the line. It may range from minor, if only the [[label]] of a package is being changed (for example from an [[English language|English]] to a [[Spanish language|Spanish]] label) to major, requiring complete disassembly of the equipment, cleaning and [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilizing]] of the line components in the case of an injectable pharmaceutical product.

===Set-up===
''Set-up'' is the process of actually converting the equipment. This may be achieved by adjusting the equipment to correspond to the next product or by changing non-adjustable "change parts" to accommodate the product. Typically it will be a combination of both. 

===Start-up===
''Start-up'' is the time spent fine tuning the equipment after it has been restarted. It is characterized by frequent stoppages, jams, quality rejects and other problems. It is generally caused by variability in the clean-up and set-up or by variability in the product or its components.

The '''Columbian exchange''', also known as the '''Columbian interchange''', named for [[Christopher Columbus]], was the widespread transfer of plants, animals, culture, human populations, technology, and ideas between the [[Americas]], West Africa, and the [[Old World]] in the 15th and 16th centuries. It also relates to European colonization and trade following [[Christopher Columbus]]'s [[voyages of Christopher Columbus#First voyage|1492 voyage]].&lt;ref name = "history"&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Nunn |first1= Nathan |last2= Qian |first2= Nancy |year= 2010 |title= The Columbian Exchange: A History of Disease, Food, and Ideas |journal= [[Journal of Economic Perspectives]] |volume= 24 |issue= 2 |pages= 163–188 |jstor= 25703506 |doi= 10.1257/jep.24.2.163 |citeseerx= 10.1.1.232.9242 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Invasive species]], including [[communicable diseases]], were a byproduct of the Exchange. The changes in agriculture significantly altered and changed global populations. The most significant immediate impact of the Columbian exchange was the cultural exchanges and the transfer of people (both free and enslaved) between continents.

The new contact between the global population circulated a wide variety of crops and livestock, which supported increases in population in both hemispheres, although diseases initially caused precipitous declines in the numbers of [[indigenous peoples of the Americas]]. Traders returned to Europe with [[maize]], [[potato]]es, and [[tomato]]es, which became very important crops in Europe by the 18th century.

The term was first used in 1972 by American historian [[Alfred W. Crosby]] in his [[environmental history]] book ''[[The Columbian Exchange]]''.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.smithsonianmag.com/history/alfred-w-crosby-on-the-columbian-exchange-98116477/?no-ist | title=Alfred W. Crosby on the Columbian Exchange|work=Smithsonian Magazine|first= Megan|last=Gambino|date=October 4, 2011|accessdate=October 19, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was rapidly adopted by other historians and journalists and has become widely known.

== Origin of the term ==
In 1972 [[Alfred W. Crosby]], an American historian at the [[University of Texas at Austin]], published ''[[The Columbian Exchange]]''.&lt;ref name="Smithsonian"/&gt; He published subsequent volumes within the same decade. His primary focus was mapping the biological and cultural transfers that occurred between the Old and New World. He studied the effects of Columbus' voyages between the two. Specifically, the global diffusion of crops, seeds, and plants from the New World back into the Old. His research made a lasting contribution to the way scholars understand the variety of contemporary ecosystems that arose due to these transfers. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carney |first1=Judith |title=Black Rice: The African Origins of Rice Cultivation in the Americas |date=2001 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=United States of America |pages=4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term has become popular among historians and journalists, such as [[Charles C. Mann]], whose book ''[[1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created|1493]]'' expands and updates Crosby's original research.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Potatoes eventually became an important staple of the diet in much of Europe, contributing to about 25% of the population growth in Afro-Eurasia between 1700 and 1900.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nathan|first=Nunn|last2=Nancy|first2=Qian|date=2011|title=The Potato's Contribution to Population and Urbanization: Evidence from a Historical Experiment|url=|journal=Quarterly Journal of Economics|volume=2|pages=593–650|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many European rulers, including [[Frederick the Great]] of Prussia and [[Catherine the Great]] of Russia, encouraged the cultivation of the potato.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Crosby|first1=Alfred|title=The Columbian Exchange: Biological and Cultural Consequences of 1492|date=2003|publisher=Praeger|location=Westport, Connecticut|pages=184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Maize and [[cassava]], introduced by the [[Portuguese people|Portuguese]] from South America in the 16th century,&lt;ref&gt;[http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/suprtubr.htm "Super-Sized Cassava Plants May Help Fight Hunger In Africa"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131208143623/http://researchnews.osu.edu/archive/suprtubr.htm |date=December 8, 2013 }}, The Ohio State University&lt;/ref&gt; have replaced [[sorghum]] and [[millet]] as Africa's most important food crops.&lt;ref&gt;[http://scitizen.com/biotechnology/maize-streak-virus-resistant-transgenic-maize-an-african-solution-to-an-african-problem_a-28-925.html "Maize Streak Virus-Resistant Transgenic Maize: an African solution to an African Problem"], ''Scitizen'', August 7, 2007&lt;/ref&gt; 16th-century [[Spanish colonization of the Americas|Spanish colonizers]] introduced new staple crops to [[Asia]] from the [[Americas]], including [[maize]] and [[sweet potato]]es, and thereby contributed to population growth in Asia.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20090924212813/http://afe.easia.columbia.edu/special/china_1950_population.htm "China's Population: Readings and Maps"], Columbia University, East Asian Curriculum Project&lt;/ref&gt; On a larger scale, the coming of potatoes and maize to the old world "resulted in caloric and nutritional improvements over previously existing staples" throughout the Eurasian landmass&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Nathan|first=Nunn|last2=Nancy|first2=Qian|date=2010|title=The Columbian Exchange: A History of Disease, Food and Ideas|url=http://www.econ.yale.edu/~nq3/NANCYS_Yale_Website/resources/papers/NunnQianJEP.pdf|journal=Journal of Economic Perspectives|volume=2|pages=163–88, 167|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; as they created more varied and abundant food production.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Columbian Exchange: Biological and Cultural Consequences of 1492|last=Crosby|first=Alfred W.|publisher=Praeger|year=2003|isbn=|location=|pages=177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tomatoes, which came to Europe from the New World via [[Spain]], were initially prized in [[Italy]] mainly for their ornamental value (see [[#Tomatoes in the Old World|below]]). From the 19th century [[tomato sauce]]s became typical of [[Neapolitan cuisine]] and, ultimately, [[Italian cuisine]] in general.&lt;ref name=Riley2007&gt;{{cite encyclopedia| encyclopedia=The Oxford Companion to Italian Food | title=Tomato| editor=Riley, Gillian| year=2007|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=978-0-19-860617-8| pages=529–530}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Coffee]] (introduced in the Americas circa 1720) from Africa and the Middle East and [[sugarcane]] (introduced from [[South Asia]]) from the [[Spanish West Indies]] became the main export commodity crops of extensive [[Latin America]]n [[Hacienda|plantations]].

==== Rice ====
Rice was another crop that became widely cultivated during the Columbian exchange. As the demand in the New World grew, so did the knowledge on how to cultivate it. The two primary species used were oryza glaberrima and oryza sativa; originating from West Africa and Southeast Asia respectively. Slave holders in the New World relied upon the skills of enslaved Africans to further cultivate both species. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Carney|first=Judith A.|date=2001|title=African Rice in the Columbian Exchange|jstor=3647168|journal=The Journal of African History|volume=42|issue=3|pages=377–396}}&lt;/ref&gt;. North and South Carolina were key places where rice was grown during the slave trade, and islands of the Caribbean like Puerto Rico and Cuba were equally great centers of production. Enslaved Africans brought their knowledge of water control, milling, winnowing, and other general agrarian practices to the fields. This widespread knowledge amongst enslaved Africans eventually led to rice becoming a staple dietary item in the New World. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carney |first1=Judith |title=Black Rice: The African Origins of Rice Cultivation in the Americas |date=2001 |publisher=Harvard University Press |location=United States of America |pages=4-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Fruits ====
Citrus fruits and grapes were brought to the Americas from the Mediterranean. At first these crops struggled to adapt to the climate in the new world but by the late 19th century they were growing more consistently. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=McNeill |first1=J.R. |title=The Columbian Exchange |url=https://www.ncpedia.org/anchor/columbian-exchange |website=NCpedia |publisher=State Library of North Carolina |accessdate=23 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The guava plant (Diospyros mespiliformis) originated in West Africa and is now grown in Hawaii, Florida and areas of California. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Twitty |first1=Michael |title=The Cooking Gene |date=2017 |publisher=HarperCollins Publishing |page=293}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bananas were introduced to the Americas by Portuguese sailors who brought the fruits from West Africa during their enslavement of Africans in the 16th century. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gibson |first1=Arthur |title=Bananas &amp; Plantains |url=https://www.webcitation.org/6C3gSxUtN?url=http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/economicbotany/Musa/index.html |website=WebCite |publisher=UCLA |accessdate=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bananas were still only consumed in minimal amounts around the 1880's. The U.S. didn't see major rises in banana consumption until banana plantations in the Caribbean grew. The [[History of modern banana plantations in the Americas]] details the spread of this crop within the Americas.

==== Tomatoes ====
It took three centuries after their introduction in Europe for tomatoes to become widely accepted. Tobacco, potatoes, chili peppers, tomatillos, and tomatoes are all members of the nightshade family and all of these plants bear some resemblance to the European nightshade that even an amateur could deduce just by simple observation of the flowers and berries; tomatoes and potatoes can be quite lethal if the wrong part of the plant is consumed at the wrong quantity or at least cause a person to experience copious amounts of vomiting and diarrhea. Of all the New World plants introduced to Italy, only the potato took as long as the tomato to gain acceptance.  16th-century physicians, thus, had good reason to be wary that this native Mexican fruit was poisonous and the generator of "melancholic humours".  In 1544, [[Pietro Andrea Mattioli]], a [[Grand Duchy of Tuscany|Tuscan]] physician and botanist, suggested that tomatoes might be edible, but no record exists of anyone consuming them at this time. On October 31, 1548, the tomato was given its first name anywhere in Europe when a house steward of [[Cosimo I de' Medici, Grand Duke of Tuscany|Cosimo I de' Medici, Duke of Florence]], wrote to the De' Medici's private secretary that the basket of ''pomi d'oro'' "had arrived safely". At this time, the label ''pomi d'oro'' was also used to refer to figs, melons, and citrus fruits in treatises by scientists.&lt;ref name=Gentilcore&gt;''A History of the Tomato in Italy Pomodoro!'', David Gentilcore (New York, NY: Columbia University Press, 2010).&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early years, tomatoes were mainly grown as ornamentals in Italy. For example, the [[Duchy of Florence|Florentine]] aristocrat [[Giovan Vettorio Soderini]] wrote how they "were to be sought only for their beauty" and were grown only in gardens or flower beds. Tomatoes were grown in elite town and country gardens in the fifty years or so following their arrival in Europe and were only occasionally depicted in works of art. However, in 1592 the head gardener at the botanical garden of [[Aranjuez]] near Madrid, under the patronage of [[Philip II of Spain]], wrote, "it is said [tomatoes] are good for sauces". Besides this account, tomatoes remained exotic plants grown for ornamental purposes, but rarely for culinary use. The combination of pasta with tomato sauce was developed only in the late nineteenth century. Today around {{convert|32000|acres|0|abbr=on}} of tomatoes are cultivated in Italy, although there are still areas where relatively few tomatoes are grown and consumed.&lt;ref name=Gentilcore/&gt;

===Livestock===
{{further information|Plains Indians#The horse}}
Initially at least, the Columbian exchange of animals largely went in one direction, from Europe to the New World, as the Eurasian regions had domesticated many more animals. [[Horse]]s, [[donkey]]s, [[mule]]s, [[pig]]s, [[cattle]], [[sheep]], [[goat]]s, [[chicken]]s, large [[dog]]s, [[cat]]s and [[bee]]s were rapidly adopted by native peoples for transport, food, and other uses.&lt;ref name="Francis2006-livestock"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|editor=Michael Francis, John|encyclopedia=Iberia and the Americas: Culture, Politics, and History: a Multidisciplinary Encyclopedia|title=Columbian Exchange—Livestock| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OMNoS-g1h8cC&amp;pg=PA303|year=2006|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=978-1-85109-421-9|pages=303–308}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of the first European exports to the Americas, the horse, changed the lives of many [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] tribes. The mountain tribes shifted to a [[nomadic]] lifestyle, as opposed to [[agriculture]], based on hunting [[bison]] on horseback and moved down to the [[Great Plains]]. The existing Plains tribes expanded their territories with horses, and the animals were considered so valuable that horse herds became a measure of wealth.&lt;ref&gt;[[Evolution of the horse|This transfer reintroduced horses]] to the Americas, as the species had died out there prior to the development of the modern horse in Eurasia.&lt;/ref&gt;

The effects of the introduction of European livestock on the environments and peoples of the New World were not always positive. In the Caribbean, the proliferation of European animals had large effects on native fauna and undergrowth and damaged ''conucos,'' plots managed by indigenous peoples for subsistence.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

===Disease===
{{further information|Influx of disease in the Caribbean|Virgin soil epidemic|Cocoliztli epidemics}}
European exploration of tropical areas was aided by the New World discovery of [[quinine]], the first effective treatment for [[malaria]]. Europeans suffered from this disease, but some indigenous populations had developed at least partial resistance to it. In Africa, resistance to malaria has been associated with other genetic changes among sub-Saharan Africans and their descendants, which can cause [[sickle-cell disease]].&lt;ref name="history" /&gt;{{rp|164}} In fact, the resistance of sub-Saharan Africans to malaria in the Southern United States contributed to the development of slavery in those regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Esposito|first=Elena|date=Summer 2015|title=Side Effects of Immunities: the African Slave Trade|url=http://eh.net/eha/wp-content/uploads/2015/05/Esposito.pdf|journal=European University Institute|volume=|pages=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Before regular communication had been established between the two hemispheres, the varieties of domesticated animals and [[infectious diseases]] that jumped to humans, such as [[smallpox]], were substantially more numerous in the Old World than in the New due to more extensive long-distance trade networks. Many had migrated west across Eurasia with animals or people, or were brought by traders from Asia, so diseases of two continents were suffered by all occupants. While Europeans and Asians were affected by the Eurasian diseases, their [[endemic]] status in those continents over centuries resulted in many people gaining [[acquired immunity]].

By contrast, "Old World" diseases had a devastating effect when introduced to Native American populations via European carriers, as the people in the Americas had no natural [[immunity (medical)|immunity]] to the new diseases. [[Measles]] caused many deaths. The [[smallpox]] epidemics are believed to have caused the largest death tolls among Native Americans, surpassing any wars&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html "The Story Of... Smallpox – and other Deadly Eurasian Germs"], ''Guns, Germs and Steel'', PBS {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5mr1L9bc6?url=http://www.pbs.org/gunsgermssteel/variables/smallpox.html |date=17 January 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and far exceeding the comparative loss of life in Europe due to the [[Black Death]].&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;{{rp|164}} It is estimated that upwards of 80–95 percent of the Native American population died in these epidemics within the first 100–150 years following 1492. Many regions in the Americas lost 100%.&lt;ref name="history"/&gt;{{rp|165}} The beginning of demographic collapse on the North American continent has typically been attributed to the spread of a well-documented smallpox epidemic from Hispaniola in December 1518.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Caribbean: A History of the Region and Its Peoples.|last=Palmié|first=Stephan|publisher=University of Chicago Press|year=2011|isbn=9780226645087|location=Chicago|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; At that point in time, approximately only 10,000 indigenous people were still alive in Hispaniola.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Similarly, [[yellow fever]] is thought to have been brought to the Americas from Africa via the [[Atlantic slave trade]]. Because it was endemic in Africa, many people there had acquired immunity. Europeans suffered higher rates of death than did African-descended persons when exposed to yellow fever in Africa and the Americas, where numerous epidemics swept the colonies beginning in the 17th century and continuing into the late 19th century. The disease caused widespread fatalities in the Caribbean during the heyday of slave-based sugar plantation.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The replacement of native forests by sugar plantations and factories facilitated its spread in the tropical area by reducing the number of potential natural mosquito predators.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The means of yellow fever transmission was unknown until 1881, when [[Carlos Finlay]] suggested that the disease was transmitted through mosquitoes, now known to be female mosquitoes of the species ''[[Aedes aegypti]]''.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

The [[history of syphilis]] has been well-studied, but the exact origin of the disease is unknown and remains a subject of debate.&lt;ref name=Kent08&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Kent ME, Romanelli F |title=Reexamining syphilis: an update on epidemiology, clinical manifestations, and management |journal=Ann Pharmacother |volume=42 |issue=2 |pages=226–36 |date=February 2008 |pmid=18212261 |doi=10.1345/aph.1K086 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are two primary hypotheses: one proposes that syphilis was carried to Europe from the [[Americas]] by the crew of Christopher Columbus in the early 1490s, while the other proposes that syphilis previously existed in Europe but went unrecognized.&lt;ref name=Orgin10/&gt; These are referred to as the "Columbian" and "pre-Columbian" hypotheses.&lt;ref name=Orgin10&gt;{{cite journal|last=Farhi|first=D|author2=Dupin, N|title=Origins of syphilis and management in the immunocompetent patient: facts and controversies.|journal=Clinics in Dermatology|date=Sep–Oct 2010|volume=28|issue=5|pages=533–8|pmid=20797514|doi=10.1016/j.clindermatol.2010.03.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The first written descriptions of the disease in the Old World came in 1493.&lt;ref name="quartz"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Smith|first1=Tara C.|title=Thanks Columbus!

===Cultural exchanges===

One of the influences related to the migration of people were cultural exchanges. For example, in the article "The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500–1800" Pieter Emmer makes the point that "from 1500 onward, a 'clash of cultures' had begun in the Atlantic".&lt;ref&gt;Emmer, Pieter. "The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500–1800." European Review 11, no. 1. Feb. 2003. p. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; This clash of culture transferred European values to indigenous cultures. For example, the emergence of private property in regions where there were little to no rights to lands, the concepts of monogamy and the nuclear family, the role of women and children in the family system, and the "superiority of free labor".&lt;ref&gt;Emmer, Pieter. "The Myth of Early Globalization: The Atlantic Economy, 1500–1800." European Review 11, no. 1. Feb. 2003. p. 46&lt;/ref&gt; An example of this type of cultural exchange occurred during the 1500s in North America. When these early European colonizers first entered North America, they encountered fence-less lands which indicated to them that this land was unimproved. For these Europeans, they were seeking economic opportunities, therefore, land and resources were important for the success of the mission. When these colonizers entered North America they encountered a fully established culture of people called the [[Powhatan]]. The Powhatan farmers in Virginia scattered their farm plots within larger cleared areas. These larger cleared areas were a communal place for naturally growing and useful plants. As the Europeans viewed fences as "hallmarks of civilization" they set about transforming "the land into something more suitable for themselves".&lt;ref&gt;Mann, Charles. 1493: Uncovering the New World Columbus Created. New York, New York: Vintage Books, 2011. loc. 1094 and 1050&lt;/ref&gt; In implementing their practices, the Europeans enslaved, murdered, and exploited indigenous populations. Furthermore, in cases of enslaved peoples (and in particular, enslaved Africans) the Europeans simultaneously implemented their value system while at the same time justifying enslaving people through a philosophy which reduced the enslaved people to property. Thus, the slave traders and some of the plantation owners used the concept of family to exploit and control the enslaved people. In other subtle ways, which had a large impact the cultural exchanges involved sharing practices and traditions. An example of this can be found in the tobacco industry.

Tobacco was one of the luxury goods which was spread as a direct result of the Columbian exchange. As is discussed in regard to the trans-Atlantic slave trade, the tobacco trade increased demand for free labor and spread tobacco worldwide. In discussing the widespread uses of tobacco, the Spanish physician Nicolas Monardes (1493–1588) noted that "The black people that have gone from these parts to the Indies, have taken up the same manner and use of tobacco that the Indians have".&lt;ref&gt;Monardes, Nicholas. "Of the Tabaco and of his Greate Vertues." Frampton, John trans, Wolf, Michael, ed. Taboacco.org. Accessed June 1, 2017 http://archive.tobacco.org/History/monardes.html&lt;/ref&gt; As the European colonizers and enslaved Africans traveled the globe and came into contact with indigenous peoples, they took with them the cultural practices related to tobacco, and spread them to additional regions. Therefore, demand for tobacco grew in the course of the cultural exchanges and increased contacts among peoples.


==== Trans Atlantic Slave Trade ====

The Trans Atlantic Slave Trade was the transfer of Africans from primarily West Africa to parts of the Americas between the 16th and 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carney |first1=Judith |title=Black Rice |date=2001 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=2–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 10 million slaves arrived in the Americas from Africa. The journey that enslaved Africans took from parts of Africa to America is commonly known as the middle passage. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Gates |first1=Louis |title=100 Amazing Facts About the Negro |url=http://www.pbs.org/wnet/african-americans-many-rivers-to-cross/history/how-many-slaves-landed-in-the-us/ |website=PBS |publisher=WNET |accessdate=25 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Enslaved Africans had a significant influence on the emerging African American culture in the New World as well as all other nations to where they were transported, especially the Caribbean and Brazil. The presence of enslaved Africans not only represented skilled labor but it also gave way to a new population which represented a hybrid of the two cultures. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carney |first1=Judith |title=Black Rice |date=2001 |publisher=Harvard University Press |pages=2–8}}
&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Birth of African American Culture: An Anthropological Perspective'' is a book written by Sidney Mintz and Richard Price further detailing the cultural impact of Enslaved Africans in America. Mintz and Price's book helped to publicize how integral the socialization aspects of plantation life were to the structures of black culture.

The treatment of enslaved Africans during the Trans Atlantic Slave Trade became one of the most controversial topics in the history of the New World. Since its abolishment in 1865 in the USA and its total extinction by 1890 in the rest of the New World, it has remained a key subject in politics, pop culture and media.

{{further information|Introduced species|Invasive species|Lists of invasive species}}
Plants that arrived by land, sea, or air in the times before 1492 are called [[archaeophyte]]s, and plants introduced to Europe after those times are called [[Neophyte (botany)|neophytes]]. [[Invasive species]] of [[plant]]s and [[pathogen]]s also were introduced by chance, including such weeds as [[Salsola|tumbleweeds]] (''Salsola'' spp.) and [[Avena fatua|wild oats]] (''Avena fatua''). Some plants introduced intentionally, such as the [[kudzu|kudzu vine]] introduced in 1894 from [[Japan]] to the United States to help control [[soil erosion]], have since been found to be invasive pests in the new environment. 

Fungi have also been transported, such as the one responsible for [[Dutch elm disease]], killing [[Ulmus americana|American elms]] in North American forests and cities, where many had been planted as street trees. Some of the invasive species have become serious ecosystem and economic problems after establishing in the New World environments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | url=http://www.actionbioscience.org/biodiversity/simberloff.html | title=Introduced Species: The Threat to Biodiversity &amp; What Can Be Done | author=Simberloff, Daniel | journal=American Institute of Biological Sciences: Bringing Biology to Informed Decision Making. | year=2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fernández Pérez, Joaquin and Ignacio González Tascón (eds.) (1991). ''La agricultura viajera''. Barcelona, Spain: Lunwerg Editores, S. A.&lt;/ref&gt; A beneficial, although probably unintentional, introduction is ''[[Saccharomyces eubayanus]]'', the yeast responsible for [[lager]] beer now thought to have originated in [[Patagonia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.discovery.com/history/lager-yeast-pagatonia-110823.html Elusive Lager Yeast Found in Patagonia], ''Discovery News'', August 23, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; Others have crossed the Atlantic eastwards to Europe and have had the power to change the course of history: in the 1840s [[Phytophthora infestans|phytophthera infestans]] crossed the oceans and caused problems with the potato crop in several nations of Europe but totally destroyed the crop of Ireland and lead millions to starve to death and die in the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Irish Potato Famine]].

In addition to these, many animals were introduced to new habitats on the other side of the world either accidentally or incidentally. These include such animals as [[brown rat]]s, [[earthworm]]s (apparently absent from parts of the pre-Columbian New World), and [[zebra mussel]]s, which arrived on ships.&lt;ref name = "Hoddle"&gt;{{cite web |first = M. S. |last = Hoddle |url=http://cisr.ucr.edu/quagga_zebra_mussels.html |title=Quagga &amp; Zebra Mussels |publisher=Center for Invasive Species Research, [[University of California, Riverside ]] |date= |accessdate=June 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escaped and feral populations of non-indigenous animals have thrived in both the Old and New Worlds, often negatively impacting or displacing native species. In the New World, populations of feral European cats, pigs, horses and cattle are common, and the [[Burmese python]] and [[green iguana]] are considered problematic in Florida. In the Old World, the [[Eastern gray squirrel]] have been particularly successful in colonising [[Great Britain]] and populations of [[raccoon]]s can now be found in some regions of Germany, the Caucasus and Japan. Fur farm escapees such as [[coypu]] and [[American mink]] have extensive populations.

==History==
The first antenna was created in England in 2003 by Adam Montandon in collaboration with colorblind artist [[Neil Harbisson]].&lt;ref name="BBCOutlook"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Bannister|first1=Matthew|title=Outlook|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/p00my2ry|publisher=BBC World Service|accessdate=4 June 2014|page=16m41s|date=2012-01-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The invention, under the name "eyeborg" and under the heading ''Bridging the Island of the Colourblind Project'', won a British award in Innovation (Submerge 2004)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.plymouth.ac.uk/pages/view.asp?page=10944] Submerge Innovation Award (Bristol, 2004){{dead link|date=February 2017|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a European award in Content Tools and Interface Design ([[Europrix]] 2004).&lt;ref&gt;[[Europrix]] Europrix Awards&lt;/ref&gt; In 2007, Peter Kese, a software developer from [[Kranj]], [[Slovenia]], made further developments to the antenna by increasing the number of color [[hue]]s to 360 and adding [[color saturation]] through different volume levels.&lt;ref&gt;Harbisson, Neil. [http://www.artinfo.com/news/enlarged_image/27743/96442/ "Painting by ear"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080803074843/http://www.artinfo.com/news/enlarged_image/27743/96442/ |date=2008-08-03 }} ''Modern Painters, The International Contemporary Art Magazine'' pp.70-73. New York, June 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, Matias Lizana, a student from [[Universitat Politècnica de Catalunya]] developed the antenna into a chip as part of his final year project.&lt;ref name="lavanguardia.es"&gt;Sanchis, Ima.

==Color to sound scales==
{{See also|Sonochromatism#Harbisson's Sonochromatic Scales}}
[[File:Harbisson's Sonochromatic Scales.png|550px|thumb|right| The Harbisson's Sonochromatic Music Scale]]
Harbisson's Sonochromatic Music Scale (2003) is a microtonal and [[logarithmic scale]] with 360 notes in an octave. Each note corresponds to a specific degree of the [[color wheel]]. The scale was introduced to the first antenna in 2004.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.artinfo.com/news/story/27743/june-2008-table-of-contents/] ''Modern Painters, The International Contemporary Art Magazine'' pp 70-73 (New York, June 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

Harbisson's Pure Sonochromatic Scale (2005) is a non-logarithmic scale based on the [[:wikt:transpose|transposition]] of light frequencies to sound frequencies. The scale discards color as being part of a color wheel and ignores musical/logarithmic perception so it can overstep the limits of human perception. The introduction of the new scale to the eyeborg in 2010, allows users to decide whether they want to perceive colors logarithmically or not.&lt;ref name="lavanguardia.es"/&gt;

==Collaborations==
[[File:Eyeborgs for the blind.jpg|thumb|right|Blind Ecuadorians trying out cyborg antennas (2011)]]
Since 2005, antennas have been donated to blind communities in Europe, Asia and America with the aim of helping the blind develop the sense of color.&lt;ref&gt;EFE [http://www.prensa.com/impreso/tecnologia-%C2%B4cyborg%C2%B4-para-la-vision/35482 "Tecnologia cyborg para la vision"], [[EFE]], 27 October 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The first blind person to try out an eyeborg was [[Sabriye Tenberken]] followed by blind students from [[Braille Without Borders]] in Tibet and members of the Sociedad de Ciegos de Pichincha in Ecuador.&lt;ref&gt;Redacción [http://elcomercio.pe/tecnologia/721054/noticia-fundacion-se-dedica-convertir-humanos-ciborgs "Una fundación se dedica a convertir humanos en ciborgs"] ''[[El Comercio (Peru)]]'', 1 Mar 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, vice-president of Ecuador [[Lenin Moreno]] announced that his government would collaborate with the [[Cyborg Foundation]] to create antennas and new sensory extensions.&lt;ref&gt;Redaccion [http://www.eltiempo.com.ec/noticias-cuenca/81856-gobierno-impulsara-plan-para-no-videntes/ "Gobierno impulsara plan para no videntes"], [[El Tiempo (Ecuador)]], 30 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012, after lecturing at Escola Politécnica de Pernambuco in Recife,&lt;ref&gt;Redação [http://www.diariodepernambuco.com.br/nota.asp?materia=20120430114940 "Primeiro ciborgue do mundo estará nesta quarta na UPE"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512032546/http://diariodepernambuco.com.br/nota.asp?materia=20120430114940 |date=2012-05-12 }}, ''[[Diário de Pernambuco]]'', 30 April 2012&lt;/ref&gt; the [[Cyborg Foundation]] signed a partnership to create antennas and other new human extensions in collaboration with [[Universidade de Pernambuco]] in Brazil.&lt;ref&gt;Lins, Letícia [http://oglobo.globo.com/tecnologia/homem-ciborgue-desenvolve-projeto-no-brasil-4794658 "Homem-ciborgue desenvolve projeto no Brasil"], ''[[O Globo]]'', 2 May 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

Antennas are currently being treated as body parts rather than as devices, and therefore are donated rather than sold.&lt;ref&gt;Maia, Rafael [http://tecnologia.terra.com.br/campus-party/2012/noticias/0,,OI5602708-EI19138,00-Nao+quero+vender+olhos+diz+ciborgue+que+ouve+as+cores.html "Nao quero vender olhos"], [[Terra Networks]], 9 February 2012.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Dimethyl dicarbonate''' ('''DMDC''') is an [[organic compound]] which is a colorless liquid with a pungent odor at high concentration at [[room temperature]]. It is primarily used as a [[drink|beverage]] [[preservative]], processing aid, or [[Sterilization (microbiology)#Chemical sterilization|sterilant]] ([[International Numbering System|INS No.]] 242), and acts by [[Enzyme inhibitor|inhibiting]] the [[enzyme]]s [[acetate kinase]] and [[L-glutamic acid decarboxylase]].&lt;ref name="Chembank1924"&gt;[http://chembank.broad.harvard.edu/compounds/display_structure.html?tab=properties&amp;structure_id=1924]{{dead link|date=October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has also been proposed that DMDC inhibits the enzymes [[alcohol dehydrogenase]] and [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase|glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate]] [[glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase|dehydrogenase]] by causing the methoxycarbonylation of their [[histidine]] components.&lt;ref name="findarticles01"&gt;[http://www.findarticles.com/p/articles/mi_m3488/is_n10_v71/ai_8963440 DMDC's role in bottle stability - dimethyl dicarbonate], Wines &amp; Vines, Oct 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

== Use in wine ==
In [[wine]], it is often used to replace [[potassium sorbate]], as it inactivates [[yeast (wine)|wine spoilage yeasts]] such as ''[[Brettanomyces]]''. Once it has been added to beverages, the efficacy of the chemical is provided by the following reactions:
:DMDC + water → methanol + carbon dioxide
:DMDC + ethanol → ethyl methyl carbonate
:DMDC + ammonia → methyl carbamate
:DMDC + [[amino acid]] → derived carboxymethyl

The application of DMDC is particularly useful when wine needs to be sterilized but cannot be sterile filtered, [[pasteurization|pasteurized]], or sulfured. DMDC is also used to stabilize non-alcoholic beverages such as carbonated or non-carbonated juice beverages, isotonic sports beverages, iced teas and flavored waters.

DMDC is added before the filling of the beverage. It then breaks down into small amounts of [[methanol]] and [[carbon dioxide]], which are both natural constituents of fruit and vegetable juices.

The EU [[Scientific Committee on Food]], the [[Food and Drug Administration (United States)|FDA]] in the United States and the [[The Joint FAO/WHO Expert Committee Report on Food Additives|JECFA]] of the WHO have confirmed the safe use in beverages. The [[Food and Drug Administration|FDA]] approved its use in wines in 1988, with the maximum level being permitted set at 200&amp;nbsp;mg/L, and only if there were fewer than 500 yeast cells/mL at time of dosage.&lt;ref&gt;US Food and Drug Administration: {{cite web|url=http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodAdditives/FoodAdditiveListings/ucm091048.htm |title=Listing of Food Additives Status Part I |accessdate=2011-10-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130314104055/http://www.fda.gov/Food/FoodIngredientsPackaging/FoodAdditives/FoodAdditiveListings/ucm091048.htm |archivedate=2013-03-14 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is also approved in the EU, where it is listed under [[E number]] E242,&lt;ref&gt;UK Food Standards Agency: {{cite web |url=http://www.food.gov.uk/safereating/chemsafe/additivesbranch/enumberlist |title=Current EU approved additives and their E Numbers |accessdate=2011-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; as well as Australia and New Zealand.&lt;ref&gt;Food Standards Australia and New Zealand, Application A1015 - Classification of Dimethyl Dicarbonate - Approval Report -15 December 2010{{cite web |url=http://www.foodstandards.gov.au/code/applications/pages/applicationa1025clas4387.aspx |title= Application A1025 - Classification of Dimethyl Dicarbonate|accessdate=2010-12-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Earthbag_Edge_of_7_School_Basa_Nepal.jpg|thumb|right|A school made from earthbags that survived the [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake]].]]
'''Earthbag construction''' is an inexpensive method using mostly local soil to create structures which are both strong and can be quickly built.

It is a [[natural building]] technique developed from historic military [[bunker]] construction techniques and temporary flood-control [[Dike (construction)|dike]] building methods. The technique requires very basic construction materials: sturdy sacks filled with organic material usually available on site. 

Standard earthbag fill material has internal stability. Either moist subsoil that contains enough clay to become cohesive when tamped, or a water-resistant angular [[gravel]] or crushed [[volcanic rock]] is used. Walls are gradually built up by laying the bags in courses—forming a staggered pattern similar to [[bricklaying]].

The walls can be curved or straight, domed with earth or topped with conventional roofs. Curved walls provide good lateral stability, forming round rooms and/or domed ceilings like an [[igloo]].

Buildings with straight walls longer than {{Convert|5|m|ft|1|abbr=on}} in length need intersecting walls or bracing buttresses. International standards exist for bracing wall size and spacing for earthen construction in different types of seismic risk areas, most notably the performance-based standards of New Zealand&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Hugh. (2006) [https://www.researchgate.net/publication/238731694_New_Zealand_Aseismic_Performance-Based_Standards_Earth_Construction_Research_and_Opportunities Aseismic Performance-Based Standards for Earth Construction], pp. 52–66&lt;/ref&gt; recommended by the [[ASTM International]]'s earth building standards&lt;ref&gt;Standard Guide for Design of Earthen Wall Building Systems E2392 / E2392M – 10e1&lt;/ref&gt;. Static shear testing shows that earthbag can reach similar strengths to New Zealand's reinforced adobe standards with specific soil strengths and reinforcement&lt;ref&gt; Stouter, Patti (May 2017)  Estimated Shear Strengths of Contained Earth Walls. Build Simple Inc. www.BuildSimple.org &lt;/ref&gt; although unreinforced weak soil earthbag can have lower shear strength than unreinforced adobe. 
	
To improve friction between bags and wall tensile strength [[barbed wire]] is usually placed between courses. [[Twine]] is also sometimes wrapped around the bags to tie one course to the next, to hold in-progress structures together and keep courses well-seated on barbed wire prongs. [[Rebar]] can be hammered into walls to strengthen corners and opening edges and provide resistance against overturning.

The structure is typically finished with [[plaster]], either cement [[stucco]] on a strong mesh layer or an [[adobe]] or lime plaster, to shed water and prevent fabric UV damage.

This construction technique is one of the most versatile [[natural building]] methods and can be used for benches, freestanding walls, [[emergency shelter]]s, temporary or permanent [[house|housing,]] or [[barn]]s and commercial buildings. Earthbag is frequently chosen for many small-to-medium-sized institutional structures in the developing world. Subgrade structures including underground and bermed dwellings (such as [[Earthship|Earthships]]), [[Cistern|cisterns]], [[Spring_box|spring boxes]], [[Root cellar|root cellars]], and retaining walls can be built with stabilized soil fill or with additional reinforcement and water-resistant gravel or sand fill.

==Earthbag development==
===Superadobe===
While Gernot Minke, the German professor of earthen architecture, first developed a technique of using bags filled with pumice to build walls, it was architect and builder [[Nader Khalili]] who first popularized earthbag construction (particularly for residential buildings)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthbagbuilding.com/history.htm History of Earthbag at]. Earthbagbuilding.com. Retrieved on 2011-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt;.
     
Khalili called his technique [[superadobe]], because he filled the bags with moistened adobe soil. Buildings at the Cal Earth Institute in [[Hesperia, California|Hesperia, CA]], which he established in 1991, include domes and vaulted roofs. Khalili pioneered code approval of earthbag domes for seismic risk regions&lt;ref&gt; Kahlili, Nadir and Vittore, P. (1998) [http://www.earthbagbuilding.com/Testing/superadobe.htm Earth Architecture and Ceramics: The Sandbag/ Superadobe/ Superblock Construction System] Cal-Earth&lt;/ref&gt;. Several books and videos have been produced by the institute to demonstrate his methods, however a number of other individuals and groups now offer training workshops.

===Writers===
Although Joseph Kennedy probably invented the term earthbag (as well as contained earth), Paulina Wojciechowska wrote the first book on the topic of earthbag building in 2001, ''Building with Earth: A Guide to Flexible-Form Earthbag Construction''. Kelly Hart developed a massive online database of earthbag information that encouraged idea sharing. Kaki Hunter and Doni Kiffmeyer worked on a variety of projects after studying with Khalili, calling earthbag 'flexible form rammed earth'. Their 2004 book, ''Earthbag Building: the Tools, Tricks and Techniques'', is available as an e-book.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ebooks.com/ebooks/book_details.asp?IID=256395 Earthbag Building: The Tools, Tricks and Techniques eBook]. eBooks.com (2004-11-19). Retrieved on 2011-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

Free online booklets have been developed by different authors, including Owen Geiger and Patti Stouter. These include structural research and field testing techniques developed for rural areas.&lt;ref&gt;[http://buildsimple.org/resource-lists.php BSI Resources]. Build Simple Inc. Retrieved on 2017-01-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2011 e-book by Geiger, ''Earthbag Building Guide: Vertical Walls Step-by-Step'', provides photo illustrations of the process and discussions of new techniques for low-risk areas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.earthbagbuilding.com/articles/ebbuildingguide.htm|title=Earthbag Building Guide: Vertical Walls|last=Geiger|first=Owen|date=2011|website=www.earthbagbuilding.com|publisher=|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Promoters===
Many like Akio Inoue, from Tenri University in Japan and Scott Howard of Earthen Hand have tested and built buildings. Hart, with Geiger,&lt;ref&gt;Natural Building Blog [http://www.naturalbuildingblog.com/]&lt;/ref&gt; encouraged earthbag's development into different culturally and climatically-appropriate shapes. Robert Shear built an [[earthship]] inspired earthbag house in Utah and Morgan Caraway of Sustainable Life School is building a house that incorporates earthship design principles as well.

Dr. John Anderton of South Africa has tested a triple channel bag version that reduces the slumping problems inherent in non-cohesive fill material like sand,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.earthbagbuild.com/earthbagbuild.htm EarthBag Building System]. Earthbagbuild.com. Retrieved on 2011-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt; and pioneered work in a narrow wall contained sand system which he calls E-khaya.

Fernando Pacheco of Brazil pioneered the use of lighter HDPE mesh tubing for simpler hyperadobe walls.{{Citation needed|date=June 2018}} 

Rebuilding after natural disasters and in low-income regions around the world has included earthbag. Although heavy earthen walls are usually dangerous in quakes, [[April 2015 Nepal earthquake|Nepal's spring 2015 earthquakes]] left earthbag buildings in good condition near destroyed buildings. 

Engineer Nabil Taha developed the first general specifications for one type of exterior pinning reinforcement appropriate for the highest seismic risk zones.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.structure1.com/Earthbag.pdf Project Types: Sustainable Building 541-850-6300]. (PDF). Retrieved on 2011-07-27.&lt;/ref&gt; Several engineering students have tested uncured or low strength earthbag, and Build Simple has tested cured cohesive walls&lt;ref&gt; EarthbagBuilding.com [http://www.earthbagbuilding.com/testing.htm Earthbag Testing Research Summary]&lt;/ref&gt;. Organizations building in Nepal are currently working with engineers to improve and refine reinforcement options for seismic-resistant earthbag. 

== Construction method==
[[File:Earthbag Structure Time-Lapse.webm|right|thumb|Timelapse video of an earthbag building being made]]
Construction usually begins by digging a [[trench]] to undisturbed mineral [[subsoil]], which is partially filled with stones and/or gravel to create a [[rubble trench foundation]]. In high seismic risk regions a reinforced concrete footing or grade beam may be recommended. Earthbag buildings can also be built on conventional [[Concrete slab|concrete slabs]] (though this is more expensive and uses more embodied energy than a rubble trench foundation) and can have a bermed or underground "floating" foundation like an earthship as well.

Several courses of gravel in doubled woven bags form a water-resistant [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]]. Each layer usually has two strands of [[barbed wire]] on top, that attaches to the bag to prevents slippage and resists any tendency for the outward expansion of dome or rectangular walls.

Bags on the course above are offset by {{Convert|200|mm|in|0|abbr=on}}—half of the {{Convert|450|mm|in||abbr=on}} wall width—similar to running bond in masonry. Bags can either be pre-filled with material and hoisted up, or bags or tubes are filled in place. The weight of the earthen fill locks the bag in place on the barbed wire below. A light tamping of the bags or tubes consolidates the moist clay-containing fill and creates interlocking bags or tubes anchored on the barbed wire. 

=== Container types ===
Solid-weave [[polypropylene]] is most popular, available around the world to transport rice or other grains. Polypropylene is low cost and resists water damage, [[Decomposition|rot]], and [[insect]]s. Tubes are often available from manufacturers who sew them into bags. Mesh tubes of soft crocheted poly fibers are also used, although stiff extruded mesh or woven mesh bags can also be used.

Organic/natural materials such as [[hemp]], [[burlap]] (like "[[gunny sack]]s") can be used. Since these may rot, they should only be used with cohesive fills (containing a significant proportion of clay) that form solid masses when tamped.

=== Terminology ===
[[File:Types of Contained Earth.jpg|thumb|Types of Contained Earth]]
Earthbag is now a varied family of techniques. Each type of fill and container has different strength and reinforcement requirements. 

For hazardous locations, accurate terminology is needed. [[Contained Earth]] (CE) is based on the original technique, but with specific soil strengths and reinforcement chosen for hazard levels. CE uses damp, cohesive, tamped bag fill, which bonds strongly with barbed wire and other reinforcement as the wall cures.

CE is not 'sandbags'. Contained Sand (CS) uses sand fill or any fill too dry or with poor cohesion that performs structurally like sandbags. CS must be built with solid-weave fabric bags and have good protection from fabric damage, relying on the strength of the bag fabric for wall strength&lt;ref&gt; Canadell R., Samuel, A. Blanco and S. Cavalero (2016) [https://upcommons.upc.edu/handle/2117/87476 Comprehensive Design Method for Earthbag and Superadobe] Materials and Design 96 (2016) 270- 282&lt;/ref&gt;. CS needs more vertical reinforcement for both shear and out-of-plane strength than CE, or may require a structural skin. Some builders use narrow bags of contained sand as wall infill. 

Contained Gravel (CG) uses fill of any aggregate larger than coarse sand, usually in doubled rice bags, although strong mesh can be used. CG limits dampness transmission from footings. 

Modular CE is built in grain bags or similar tubes. Walls rely on attachment between barbed wire barbs and/ or added pins between courses. Solid CE is hyperadobe built in some type of [[Warp knitting|knit raschel]] mesh tube, so that the damp earthen fill solidifies between courses.

===Bag-fill materials===
Generally inorganic material is used as filler, but some organic material (such as rice hulls) can be used if a strong matrix like wire mesh reinforces the plaster. 

Earthen fill may contain 5–50% clay, and can be 'reject fines,' 'road base,' 'engineered fill,' or local subsoil. 'Raw' or un-stabilized soils cure as solid units but cannot withstand prolonged soaking. Subsoils with clay mold tightly and attach well to barbed wire prongs and rebar. 

Soil fill can contain a high proportion of aggregate, as long as it tamps and cures strongly. Crushed bottles, strong rubble, or plastic trash can be used, but high aggregate mixes may interfere with inserting rebar. 

Sands, stone dust and gravels can survive prolonged flood conditions, but most require special bracing during construction as well as some form of structural skin. Sand fill may be appropriate for several courses to provide a vibration damping building base, but becomes unstable in ordinary bags above {{Convert|60-100|cm|in||abbr=on}} in height. 

Cement, lime or bitumen stabilization can allow clay soil to withstand flooding or allow sands to be used in traditional bags with a non-structural plaster skin. Because earthbag walls are usually {{Convert|38|cm|in|abbr=on}} thick a large amount of stabilizer is needed.
 
Thermal insulating properties are important for climates that experience temperature extremes. The thermal [[Thermal insulation|insulating]] value of a material is directly related to both the porosity of the material and the thickness of the wall. Crushed [[volcanic rock]], [[pumice]] or [[rice hulls]] yield higher insulation value than clay or sand. Untreated organic materials that could decay should not be used as part of a structural wall, although they can be used as infill. 

United Earth Builders has tried a light straw clay in the hyperadobe mesh tubing to form a layer 200 mm (8") thick outside of a dome&lt;ref&gt; United Earth Builders (2017) [http://www.unitedearthbuilders.com/projects UEB Eco-Guesthouse Prototype] Accessed July 5, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;.
	 
Thermal mass properties of earthen fill moderate temperature swings in climates that experience high temperature fluctuations from night to day. This [[thermal flywheel effect]] makes massive earth walls ideal for mild or hot and dry climates. Clay or sand also have excellent heat retention characteristics and, when properly insulated from the home's exterior, can serve as thermal mass in a [[passive solar building design]] in cool climates, keeping interior temperatures stable year-round.

=== Reinforcement and Structural Performance ===
Solid CE may be built with less barbed wire in low-risk areas because walls solidify between courses. Earthbag using woven bags or tubes need barbed wire for any level of natural hazard since the bag-to-bag surfaces are slippery. Pins between courses do not contribute important linear out-of-plane strength&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Brandon et al. (2013) Wind Load Test of Earthbag Wall. Buildings 2013, 3, 532-544&lt;/ref&gt;. Walls of earthbag with barbed wire are more flexible than adobe and may resist collapse when carefully detailed.  

Earthbag of weak soil with no steel can be half the shear strength of unreinforced adobe, which is easily damaged in earthquakes. New Zealand's code detailing and plans allow unreinforced adobe walls to survive almost 0.6 g forces (comparable to Ss values for 2% probability of excedance in 50 years), but earthbag needs stronger soil to match this strength. Earthbag in Nepal surpassed this strength slightly by resisting forces above 0.7 g in early 2015 &lt;ref&gt;Stouter, P. (May 2015) Rebuilding Nepal Sustainably: Culture, Climate and Quakes p. 7 Build Simple Inc., www.BuildSimple.org &lt;/ref&gt;. Domes tested in California resisted approximately 1 g forces, due to the stable shape of these less than {{Convert|7|m|ft|abbr=on}} diameter buildings &lt;ref&gt;Kahlili, N. and Vittore, P. (1998) [http://www.earthbagbuilding.com/Testing/superadobe.htm Earth Architecture and Ceramics: The Sandbag/ Superadobe/ Superblock Construction System] Cal-Earth&lt;/ref&gt;.

Current earthbag techniques of inserting rebar unattached to base and overlapping without connection may only resist 1.2 g or less, even if using very strong soil. Special reinforcement is needed 

Solid CE of strong soil has higher shear and out of plane strength than modular CE,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite |title=Stronger EB Corners|last=Stouter|first=P.|date=May 2016|website=www.BuildSimple.org|publisher=Build Simple Inc.|access-date=2017-01-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;. It may also allow the use of mesh for horizontal reinforcement in addition to or in place of barbed wire.

Contained gravel or contained sand may perform best with wire wrapped around the sides of straight wall sections, alternating with the next course having barbed wire gift-wrapped under and over the same straight sections. Base walls of CG in high risk regions may need additional buttresses at the foundation level where builders cannot afford a reinforced concrete (RC) grade beam or footing. A narrower plastic mesh tube often used for erosion control wattle could be filled with gravel to allow a half-width RC ring beam under the wide walls.

===Forming the house===
A roof can be formed by gradually sloping the walls inward to construct a dome. Vaulted roofs can be built on forms. Or a bond beam is used under a traditional roof type. Hip roofs, gable-type trusses or vigas may be needed to reduce outward stress on earthen walls.

Earth domes are inexpensive to build, but waterproofing them is complex or expensive in humid regions.
	 
Windows and doors can be formed with a traditional masonry [[lintel]] or with [[corbel]]ing or [[arch|brick-arch]] techniques, on temporary forms. Light may also be brought in by skylights, glass-capped pipes, or bottles placed between bag courses during construction.

===Finishing===
Cover the wall to prevent damage to the bags from [[UV]] rays or moisture with cement-based [[stucco]], or lime or earthen [[plaster]]. If walls are 'raw' earth, an infill plaster of earth with straw is used to fill the nooks between bags or courses. A finish plaster is applied on top.

Roof overhangs are helpful to reduce plaster [[waterproofing]] requirements, although plaster on lower walls may be stronger and more water-resistant than plaster on upper walls.

Some buildings use a planted-earth "living roof" ("green-roof") to top the structure, while others use a more conventional framing and roof placed atop earth-bag walls.

==Environment friendly==
Earthbag construction uses very little energy compared to other durable construction methods. Unlike concrete, brick or wood, no energy is needed to produce the earthen fill other than gathering soil. If on-site soil is used, little energy is needed for transportation. Unlike [[rammed earth]] construction, only human labor energy is required to tamp the soil lightly. The energy-intensive materials that ''are'' used — plastic (for bags &amp; twine), steel wire, and perhaps the outer shell of plaster or stucco — are used in relatively small quantities compared to other types of construction, often totaling less than 5% of the building materials. Buildings last a long time when maintained. However, if 'raw' or unstabilized soil is used as fill, when the building is no longer useful the earthen fill can be [[recycled]] into either garden areas, backfill, or new earthen buildings.

Since then, local builders flocked to ongoing earthbag training opportunities, including those by Good Earth Nepal, which have led to official Nepal building code acceptance of this technique. International NPOs have built hundreds of contained earth or earthbag buildings in Nepal as well.

==Colonization of the Moon==
Khalili proposed using the techniques of earthbag construction for [[Colonization of the Moon|building structures on the Moon]] or other planets. Currently, it is quite expensive to lift a positive-mass payload from Earth. Thus, Khalili's techniques would seem to be an ideal solution as the requisite supplies would consist of lightweight bags and a few tools to fill them. He specified that such bags would probably have pre-sewn "[[hook and loop]]" (i.e. [[Velcro]]) fastener strips in lieu of barbed wire.

The ''' KODAK  Motioncorder ''' is a 512 x 480 [[High-speed camera]].  It is part of the [[Photron]] FASTCAM line of cameras, introduced in 1996.
Photron Kodak Motioncorder was introduce in 1996.  The camera was manufacture by Photron but trade branded as a KODAK MASD product.   The Kodak Motioncorder and the Photron FASTCAM Super 10K Motioncorder are the same camera, just different trade names.

==Overview and features==
The Kodak Motioncorder native resolution is 512 x 480 pixels x 8 bits at 250 FPS.  By reducing the resolution, the frame rate for recording can be increased.  As an example, 1000 FPS is achieved with a resolution of 256 x 240 pixels at 8 bits.   The 10,000 FPS requires the resolution be reduced to 128 x 34 pixels at 8 bits.  The Kodak Motioncorder came with three different memory storages capabilities.  The Processor could hold either 128 MB, 384 MB or 512 MB.  With the maximum memory, the camera can record 2,184 images or 8.73 seconds of record time at 250 FPS.  Digital image data could be read from the Processor through a [[SCSI]] interface.  Live video images could be displayed on [[NTSC]] or [[PAL]] monitors.  Ancillary information would be display as OSD (On-Screen-Data).  The camera cable could be up to 16m from the Processor.  The system could be controlled from a computer through an RS-232 interface sending simple [[ASCII]] commands.

The Kodak Motioncorder  has been used in many diverse applications such as production line troubleshooting, packaging machine design and university research.   It has been verified by the manufacture that over 4000 Motioncorders/Super 10K cameras were produced from 1996 to 2005.

Another popular High-speed camera from this era was the Redlake Motionscope.  Both products used the same CCD sensor (7.4&amp;nbsp;um pixel.  The Kodak Motioncorder could record 250 FPS while the Redlake Motionscope could record 240 fps.  These two products ushered in a new class of cameras which were low cost with relatively high speed image capture that was not previously available.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8503">'''Emotions in virtual communication''' differ in a variety of ways from those in face-to-face interactions due to the characteristics of [[computer-mediated communication]] (CMC).  CMC may lack many of the auditory and visual cues normally associated with the emotional aspects of interactions.&lt;ref&gt;Kelly, J. R. and Barsade, S.G. (2001). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Sigal_Barsade/publication/222829420_Mood_and_Emotions_in_Small_Groups_and_Work_Teams/links/0fcfd50ed6e8ba6374000000.pdf "Mood and Emotions in Small Groups and Work Teams"]. Organizational behavior and human decision processes 86(1): 99-130.&lt;/ref&gt;  Research in this area has investigated how and when individuals display and interpret various [[emotion]]s in virtual settings.

==Expression==
[[File:Emoticon.svg|thumb|100px|A smiley face might reassure the recipient of a message—or be interpreted as sarcasm.]]
While text-based communication eliminates audio and visual cues, there are other methods for adding [[emotion]].  [[Emoticon]]s, or emotional icons, can be used to display various types of emotions.  Similar to emotional displays in face-to-face communication, it was found that females tend to use more emoticons than their male counterparts.&lt;ref&gt;Wolf, A. (2000). "Emotional expression online: Gender differences in emoticon use." CyberPsychology &amp; Behavior 3(5): 827-833.&lt;/ref&gt;  Beyond simply using emoticons, in virtual communication platforms, people tend to capitalize letters or words to add emphasis to speaking.&lt;ref&gt;Kiesler, S. and Sproull, L. (1992). "Group decision making and communication technology." Organizational behavior and human decision processes 52(1): 96-123.&lt;/ref&gt;

There are a variety of characteristics of virtual communication that result in an increase in the amount of emotion displayed.  The lack of social cues in CMC has been found to have a depersonalizing effect.&lt;ref&gt;Siegel, J., Dubrovsky, V., Kiesler, S., and McGuire, T. (1986). "Group processes in computer-mediated communication." Organizational behavior and human decision processes 37(2): 157-187.&lt;/ref&gt;  Additionally, there can be greater anonymity or perceptions of anonymity in virtual communication.  This combination of anonymous and social detached communication has been shown to increase the likelihood of [[flaming (Internet)|flaming]], or angry and hostile language as a result of uninhibited behavior.&lt;ref&gt;Alonzo, M. and Aiken, M. (2004). "Flaming in electronic communication." Decision Support Systems 36(3): 205-213.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moor, P. J., Heuvelman A., and Verleur, R. (2010). [http://scholar.petermoor.nl/youtube.pdf "Flaming on youtube"]. Computers in Human Behavior 26(6): 1536-1546.&lt;/ref&gt;

Furthermore, it has been shown that virtual communication can reduce normative social pressures.&lt;ref&gt;Bordia, P. (1997). [https://elearn.jku.at/wiki/images/5/55/Bordia.pdf "Face-to-face versus computer-mediated communication: A synthesis of the experimental literature"]. Journal of Business Communication 34(1): 99.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result of decreased social pressures, individuals may feel more comfortable disclosing either positive or negative [[affect (psychology)|affect]], which may not be considered appropriate in normal face-to-face interactions.  For example, in a large part due to decreased social hierarchies, Gilmore and Warren (2007) found many instances of feelings of intimacy, playfulness, and pride in a virtual teaching environment.&lt;ref&gt;Gilmore, S. and Warren, S. (2007). "Themed article: Emotion online: Experiences of teaching in a virtual learning environment." Human Relations 60(4): 581.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretation==
The lack of social and emotional cues over virtual communication platforms can result in increased instances of misinterpreting emotion and intentions.  Kruger, Epley, Parker, and Ng (2005) found that individuals overestimate both their ability to clearly relay and interpret emotions via email.&lt;ref&gt;Kruger, J., Epley, N., Parker, J. and Ng, Z. W. (2005). [http://faculty.chicagobooth.edu/nicholas.epley/krugeretal05.pdf "Egocentrism over e-mail: can we communicate as well as we think?"] Journal of Personality and Social Psychology 89(6): 925&lt;/ref&gt; They attribute this inability to relay emotions effectively to others over CMC to a combination of [[egocentrism]] and a lack of paralinguistic cues including [[gesture]]s, emphasis, and [[Intonation (linguistics)|intonations]].

One of the reasons that emails that are intended to be positive may come across as more neutral is that the process of email itself tends to be less stimulating than face-to-face communication.&lt;ref&gt;Kock, N. (2005). [https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Ned_Kock/publication/3230378_Media_richness_or_media_naturalness_The_evolution_of_our_biological_communication_apparatus_and_its_influence_on_our_behavior_toward_E-communication_tools/links/0f317538725c5a868a000000.pdf "Media richness or media naturalness? The evolution of our biological communication apparatus and its influence on our behavior toward e-communication tools"]. Professional Communication, IEEE Transactions on 48(2): 117-130.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since many people tend to associate emails with work-related matters, they come to expect less positive affect to be displayed in emails.&lt;ref&gt;Lea, M. and Spears, R. (1991). "Computer-mediated communication, de-individuation and group decision-making." International Journal of Man-Machine Studies 34(2): 283-301.&lt;/ref&gt;  Furthermore, the emotional ambiguity of email messages may actually lead to them to be interpreted as more negatively than they were intended.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;Byron, K. (2008). [http://www.imbs.uci.edu/ssarc/internship/webdocs/session03/02-ByronArticle.pdf "Carrying too heavy a load? The communication and miscommunication of emotion by email"]. Academy of Management Review 33(2): 309.&lt;/ref&gt; Byron (2008) notes that emails from senders higher in status will be more likely be perceived as negative than emails received from people who are lower in status.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"/&gt;

Given the permanent and potentially public nature of virtual communication, it is much more likely that unintended parties will view and interpret messages as opposed face-to-face communication, which is fleeting.  It has been found that when third parties view virtual communications, the third parties may interpret interactions as contentious disputes, when in fact there may not have actually been any conflict.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, P. (2007). "Themed article: Sexed up intelligence or irresponsible reporting? The interplay of virtual communication and emotion in dispute sensemaking." Human Relations 60(4): 609-636.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Management==

Due to the excess disclosure of and the potential to misinterpret emotions, conflicts can arise in virtual communication.  Communication mediums that have the greatest amount of emotional cues and immediacy of feedback will be best to reduce conflict.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"&gt;Maruping, L. M. and Agarwal, R. (2004). "Managing team interpersonal processes through technology: a task-technology fit perspective." Journal of Applied Psychology 89(6): 975.&lt;/ref&gt;  Increased emotional cues allow for better detection of negative affect, and greater displays of positive affect to counter any negative emotions.  Immediacy of feedback relates to how quickly messages are transmitted via a particular communication medium, and the expectation for which they will be responded.&lt;ref&gt;Dennis, A. R. and Valacich, J. S. (1999). Rethinking media richness: Towards a theory of media synchronicity. System Sciences, 1999. HICSS-32. Proceedings of the 32nd Annual Hawaii International Conference on, IEEE.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, instant messaging has a higher degree of immediacy of feedback than email because instant messaging tends to result in much more synchronous communication than email.  Immediacy of feedback allows individuals to detect and address frustration and other negative emotions more quickly.  Furthermore, communication mediums that are more synchronous better allow for spontaneous comments, such as jokes, which are necessary for positive affect.&lt;ref name="autogenerated2004"/&gt;  Increased positive affect helps to create positive interactions which reduce the likelihood of conflict.

'''Engineering samples''' are the [[beta version]]s of [[integrated circuit]]s that are meant to be used for compatibility qualification or as demonstrators.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.intel.com/support/processors/sb/CS-030747.htm Intel's Information about Intel Engineering / Qualification Sample Processors]&lt;/ref&gt; They are usually loaned to OEM manufacturers prior to the chip's commercial release to allow product development or display. Usually, they are picked out of a very large{{quantify|date=September 2018}} batch and perform correctly. However, rarely they may have faults that were fixed in the production model.{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}}

Engineering samples are usually handed out under a [[non-disclosure agreement]] or an other type of confidentiality agreement.

Some engineering samples, such as [[Pentium 4]] processors were rare and favoured{{Citation needed|date=July 2018}} for having unlocked base-clock multipliers.

&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:Flagging tape.png|thumb|200px|Flagging tape]] --&gt;
'''Flagging''' is a colored non-adhesive tape used in marking objects.  It is commonly made of [[PVC]] or [[Vinyl group|vinyl]], and wood fibre cellulose-based [[biodegradable]] flagging also exists.

==Uses==
===Surveying===
Flagging is used in [[surveying]] to mark grade levels, utility lines, [[survey stakes]] and other boundary markers.
Surveyors frequently attach their flagging to wooden stakes or lathes, with writing on it.  One side tends to have a long number which they reference in a log book.  The other side tends to have abbreviations suggesting what the stake marks.  Choice of color depends on many factors, and can include availability, and personal preference, or may adhere to some sort of color code.  No color codes appear to be mandatory or universal, but certain colors do tend to be used for specific purposes.

===Forestry===
In [[forestry]] flagging is commonly used to mark [[tree]]s for various purposes.  It can be used to mark trees for [[logging]], to mark dangerous or unhealthy trees, to mark invasive species, or to mark saplings.  State and National forests often use a wide variety of flagging tape, sometimes even getting specially printed tape when the full range of color codes is used up.

===Wildland fire suppression===
Flagging is widely used in [[wildland fire suppression]] both as a [[navigation]]al aid for firefighters and to mark trees.  When walking to a [[wildfire]] a crew may use flagging to flag their way to the fire, both to aid other firefighters in quickly finding the site and so they can find their way back out easily.  Specially marked flagging also exists for fire use, imprinted with terms such as "spot fire" or "escape route".

===Triage===
In [[triage]], flagging is used in lieu of a [[triage tag]] to mark patients in a mass casualty [[disaster]] situation.  Four colors of flagging are typically used:

* Black - deceased
* Red - seriously injured, in need of immediate medical attention to save life
* Yellow - seriously injured but not immediately life-threatening, medical attention can be delayed
* Green - non-serious injuries or "walking wounded"

===Outdoor recreation===
Flagging is used as a navigational aid by [[hunting|hunters]], [[hiking|hikers]], [[geocaching|geocachers]], [[caving|spelunkers]], mountain bikers, offroad vehicle users, and for other uses such as [[paintball]].

''' GIADS''' - '''German Improved Air Defence System''' - is the standard Air Command and Control System (ACC System / AC2 – System) of the [[German Air Force]] Tactical Command and Control Service (GAF TACCS).

== Definition ==
GIADS is the standard ACC System of the GAF TACCS. It is operated in the static [[Control and Reporting Centre]]s (CRC [[Erndtebrück]] and CRC [[Schönewalde]]) and the deployable CRC (on [[Holzdorf Air Base]]) in order to provide Airspace Surveillance, to control Air Force Operations, and to meet the military commitment of the [[Bundeswehr]].

== History ==
Up to the year 2000 the standard AC2 System of the GAF TACCS was [[ARKONA (FüWES)|ARKONA]] which had been taken over former the former [[Air Forces of the National People's Army|
East German Air Force]]. In the time to come it had to be replaced by the successor system GIADS. In July 2000 the first GIADS CRC in [[Schönewalde]] became operational. Since that time GIADS has been improve, further developed and introduced to the other German CRCs (including Deployable CRC). By the introduction of GIADS III in 2010/11, the probable final GAF AC2 System’s generation might have been procured.

== Prospect ==
GIADS lll should be replaced in line with the joint NATO procurement programme by the successor AC2 product, the ''Air Command and Control System ([[ACCS]])''.

==Functionality==
* Coincident / parallel RADAR data processing of up to 20 different civil/military sensors data sources
* Correlation with civil [[flight plan]] data 
* Processing of a [[Recognized Air Picture]] (RAP)
* Control of military [[aircraft]] and [[Surface to Air Missile]] (SAM) units
* Data Recording an Replay function 
* Processing of up to 12,000 plots; 3,000 system tracks and 1,000 flight paln
* [[ICAO]] [[Mode S]] capability

=== Advantages in comparison to ARKONA ===
* Automatic selection of the most beneficial radar data source by Multi-Sensor-Tracking
* Decisive enhancement of the Fighter Control capability
* [[NATO]] [[Link 16]] capability (interim / disposal solution)
* Enhanced support (e.g. emergence cases, air space violations, critical air vehicles)
* Data exchange with up to 24 external AC2 Systems 
* Improved IT-Security

== In-Service Support Management ==
The GAF Material Command, followed by the [[Waffensystemkommando der Luftwaffe|GAF Weapon Systems Command]] – WSC (de: Waffensystemkommando der Luftwaffe – WaSysKdoLw), have been in charge of the GIADS In-Service Support Management (ISSM).

'I was born in the Soviet Union, and we were poor when we came here' — to Edison, New Jersey — 'so it's incredible to me that that many people are interested.'"&lt;/ref&gt; At age 14, he joined his family's retail-wine business. After his family moved, he graduated from [[North Hunterdon High School]].&lt;ref&gt;O'Donnell, Chuck.

Accessed June 29, 2018. "The Vaynerchuks eventually relocated and Gary would graduate from North Hunterdon High School, but the Edison environment and his own immigrant’s experience seem to have shaped Vaynerchuk to his core."&lt;/ref&gt; Vaynerchuk graduated with a bachelor's degree from [[Mount Ida College]] in [[Newton, Massachusetts]] in 1998.&lt;ref name="New York Times"&gt;{{cite news|last=Asimov | first=Eric |title= Pop goes the critic | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/dining/09pour.html?_r=1|date=September 8, 2009 | work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Career ==

=== Wine Library ===

After graduating from college in 1998, Vaynerchuk assumed day-to-day control of his father's [[Springfield Township, Union County, New Jersey|Springfield, New Jersey]] store, Shopper's Discount Liquors.

In March 2009, Vaynerchuk signed a 10-book deal with [[HarperStudio]], reportedly for over $1,000,000, and released his first book, ''Crush It! Why Now is the Time to Cash in on your Passion'', in October 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | author = Nelson, Sara | title = Twitter's "Garyvee" Vaynerchuk Gets A Book Deal   | date = April 2, 2009   | url =  https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB123868606261082747 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the first weeks of its release ''Crush It!'' climbed to #1 on the Amazon Best Seller list for Web Marketing books. It also opened at number two on the New York Times Hardcover Advice bestseller list and on the ''[[Wall Street Journal]]'' bestseller List.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"&gt;{{cite news |accessdate=2009-11-02 |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/11/01/books/bestseller/ |title=Hardcover Advice for the week of October 24, 2009 |work=The New York Times |date=2009-11-01 |first=Jennifer |last=Schuessler}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Crush It!'' was also among the first books released on the [[Vook]] platform.&lt;ref&gt;marketwire.com [http://www.marketwire.com/press-release/Gary-Vaynerchuks-Crush-It-Now-a-Vook-1066071.htm Gary Vaynerchuk's "Crush It!"

In 2011, Vaynerchuk's second book was released. ''The Thank You Economy'' explores the numbers and soft factors that drive successful relationships between businesses and consumers.&lt;ref&gt;''The New York Times'' [https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2011/03/27/hardcover-advice/ The New York Times Best Sellers]&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Thank You Economy'' reached the number two spot on the New York Times hardcover advice bestseller list.

In 2013, Vaynerchuk released his third book, ''Jab, Jab, Jab, Right Hook: How to Tell Your Story in a Noisy Social World'', through publisher [[HarperCollins|Harper Collins]]. By highlighting campaigns and strategies that both succeeded and failed across all of the major social media platforms, Vaynerchuk's third book shows social media marketing strategies and tactics that he believes businesses should be avoiding or employing. ''Jab, Jab, Jab, Right-Hook'' debuted at the top of the [[The Wall Street Journal|Wall Street Journal]]'s business books list and at number four on the New York Times hardcover advice bestseller list.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/books/best-sellers/2016/03/27/advice-how-to-and-miscellaneous/?_r=0|title=NYT Best Sellers|last=|first=|date=December 15, 2013|website=|publisher=|accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303497804579237991296864348|title = Best-Selling Books Week Ended Dec. 1|date = |accessdate = |website = The Wall Street Journal|publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2016, Vaynerchuk's fourth book, ''AskGaryVee: One Entrepreneur's Take on Leadership, Social Media, and Self-Awareness'', was published by Harper Business, part of [[Harper Collins]]. Based on Vaynerchuk's [[YouTube]] series, #AskGaryVee, Vaynerchuk compiled questions and answers from his YouTube show into a book, based on categories including self-awareness, parenting, and entrepreneurial hustle. #AskGaryVee became Vaynerchuk's fourth [[New York Times]] bestseller.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

In January 2018, Vaynerchuk published a fifth book, ''Crushing It: How great entrepreneurs build and  influence- and how you can, too''.&lt;ref name = entrepreneurmag&gt;{{cite web | url = https://www.entrepreneur.com/article/307849 | publisher = Entrepreneur | title =  Gary Vaynerchuk Explains the Difference Between Entrepreneurs and Wantrepreneurs | accessdate = 26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = businessinsiderbook&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.businessinsider.com/best-business-and-leadership-books-goodreads-2018-6 | title = The 10 best business and leadership books of 2018 so far, according to readers | publisher = Business Insider | accessdate = 26 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Green information system''' ('''green IS''') or Green IT as per International Federation of Global &amp; Green ICT "IFGICT"  is a combination of [[Environment (biophysical)|environment]] and [[information technology]] (IT). The relationship between information technology and the environment is complex, because of  the negative environmental impact of IT production, use, and disposal then, making this effect greener has been termed [[Green Information Technology]], which considers IT's environmental impact primarily as a problem to be mitigated. Another effect involves the positive impact of using [[information system]]s (IS) to improve the eco-sustainability of businesses and society; this is termed green IS. This green IS viewpoint sees IS as a partial solution to many environmental problems. So green IS is a solution for the negative environmental effect of information technology. IS facilitates the reuse of waste and energy and can serve as a tool for industrial symbiosis, which involves "the mutualistic interaction of different industries for beneficial reuse of waste flows or energy cascading that results in a more resource-efficient production system and fewer adverse environmental impacts".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gholami|first1=Roya|last2=Binti Sulaiman|first2=Ainin|last3=Ramayah|first3=T|last4=Molla|first4=Alemayehu|title=Senior managers’ perception on green information systems (IS) adoption and environmental performance: Results from a field survey.|journal=Information &amp; Management|date=2013|volume=50|issue=7|pages=431–438|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0378720613000724|doi=10.1016/j.im.2013.01.004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''ISO 9564''' is an [[international standard]] for [[personal identification number]] (PIN) management and security in [[financial services]].

The PIN is used to verify the identity of a customer (the user of a [[bank card]]) within an [[electronic funds transfer]] system, and (typically) to authorize the transfer or withdrawal of funds. Therefore, it is important to protect PINs against unauthorized disclosure or misuse. Modern banking systems require interoperability between a variety of [[PIN pad|PIN entry devices]], [[smart cards]], [[Card reader#Smart card readers|card readers]], [[card issuer]]s, [[acquiring bank]]s and [[retailers]] &amp;ndash; including transmission of PINs between those entities &amp;ndash; so a common set of rules for handling and securing PINs is required, both to ensure technical compatibility and a mutually agreed level of security. ISO 9564 provides principles and techniques to meet these requirements.

ISO 9564 comprises three parts,&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Parts 1, 2 and 4. Part 3 was withdrawn in 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; under the general title of ''Financial services &amp;mdash; Personal Identification Number (PIN) management and security''.

==Part 1: Basic principles and requirements for PINs in card-based systems==

ISO 9564-1:2011&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=54083 ISO 9564-1:2011 ''Financial services &amp;mdash; Personal Identification Number (PIN) management and security &amp;mdash; Part 1: Basic principles and requirements for PINs in card-based systems'']&lt;/ref&gt; specifies the basic principles and techniques of secure PIN management. It includes both general principles and specific requirements.

===Basic principles===

The basic principles of PIN management include:

* PIN management functions shall be implemented in software and hardware in such a way that the functionality cannot be modified [[tamper-evident|without detection]], and that the data cannot be obtained or misused.
* Encrypting the same PIN with the same key but for a different [[bank account]] shall not predictably give the same cipher text.
* Security of the PIN encryption shall depend on secrecy of the key, not [[security through obscurity|secrecy of the algorithm]].
* The PIN must always be stored [[encrypted]] or physically secured.
* Only the customer (i.e. the user of a card) and/or authorized card issuer staff shall be involved with PIN selection or issuing. Where card issuer staff are involved, appropriate strictly enforced procedures shall be used.
* A stored encrypted PIN shall be protected from substitution.
* A PIN shall be revoked if it is compromised, or suspected to be.
* The card issuer shall be responsible for PIN verification.
* The customer shall be advised of the importance of keeping the PIN secret.

===PIN entry devices===

The standard specifies some characteristics required or recommended of ''PIN entry devices'' (also known as [[PIN pad]]s), i.e. the device into which the customer enters the PIN, including:

* All PIN entry devices shall allow entry of the digits zero to nine. Numeric keys may also have letters printed on them, e.g. as per [[E.161]]. These letters are only for the customers' convenience; internally, the PIN entry device only handles digits. (E.g. the standard does not support [[multi-tap]] or similar.) The standard also recommends that customers should be warned that not all devices may have letters.
* The PIN entry device shall be [[tamper-resistance|physically secured]] so that it is not feasible to modify its operation or extract PINs or [[encryption key]]s from it.
* The PIN entry device should be designed or installed so as to prevent other people from [[Shoulder surfing (computer security)|observing the PIN as it is entered]].
* The keyboard layout should be standardized, with consistent and unambiguous labels for function keys, such as "enter", "clear" (this entry) and "cancel" (the transaction). The standard also recommends specific colours for function keys: green for "enter", yellow for "clear", red for "cancel".

===Smart card readers===
A PIN may be stored in a secure [[smart card]], and verified [[offline]] by that card. The PIN entry device and the [[Card reader#Smart card readers|reader]] used for the card that will verify the PIN may be integrated into a single physically secure unit, but they do not need to be.

Additional requirements that apply to smart card readers include:

* The [[Card reader#Smart card readers|card reader]] should be constructed in such a way as to prevent someone monitoring the communications  to the card by inserting a monitoring device into the card slot.
* If the PIN entry device and the card reader are not both part of an integrated secure unit, then the PIN shall be encrypted while it is transmitted from the PIN entry device to the card reader.

===Other specific PIN control requirements===

Other specific requirements include:

* All hardware and software used for PIN processing shall be implemented such that:
** Their correct functioning can be assured.
** They cannot be modified or accessed without detection.
** The data cannot be inappropriately accessed, modified or misused.
** The PIN cannot be determined by a [[brute-force search]].
* The PIN shall not be communicated verbally. In particular bank personnel shall never ask the customer to disclose the PIN, nor recommend a PIN value.
* PIN encryption keys should not be used for any other purpose.

====PIN length====

The standard specifies that PINs shall be from four to twelve digits long, noting that longer PINs are more secure but harder to use. It also suggests that the issuer should not assign PINs longer than six digits.

====PIN selection====

There are three accepted methods of selecting or generating a PIN:

;assigned derived PIN: The card issuer generates the PIN by applying some cryptographic function to the account number or other value associated with the customer.

;assigned random PIN: The card issuer generates a PIN value using a [[random number generator]].

;customer selected PIN: The customer selects the PIN value.

====PIN issuance and delivery====

The standard includes requirements for keeping the PIN secret while transmitting it, after generation, from the issuer to the customer. These include:

* The PIN is never available to the card issuing staff.
* The PIN can only be displayed or printed for the customer in an appropriately secure manner. One method is a ''PIN mailer'', an envelope designed so that it can be printed without the PIN being visible (even at printing time) until the envelope is opened. A PIN mailer must also be constructed so that any prior opening will be obvious to the customer, who will then be aware that the PIN may have been disclosed.
* The PIN shall never appear where it can be associated with a customer's account. For example, a PIN mailer must not include the account number, but only sufficient information for its physical delivery (e.g. name and address). The PIN and the associated card shall not be mailed together, nor at the same time.

====PIN encryption====

To protect the PIN during transmission from the PIN entry device to the verifier, the standard requires that the PIN be encrypted, and specifies several formats that may be used. In each case, the PIN is encoded into a ''PIN block'', which is then encrypted by an "approved algorithm", according to [[#Part 2: Approved algorithms for PIN encipherment|part 2]] of the standard).

The PIN block formats are:

=====Format 0=====
The PIN block is constructed by [[XOR]]-ing two 64-bit fields: the ''plain text PIN field'' and the ''account number field'', both of which comprise 16 four-bit [[nibble]]s.

The plain text PIN field is:
* one nibble with the value of 0, which identifies this as a format 0 block
* one nibble encoding the length ''N'' of the PIN
* ''N'' nibbles, each encoding one PIN digit
* 14−''N'' nibbles, each holding the "[[Padding (cryptography)|fill]]" value 15 (i.e. 1111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)

The account number field is:
* four nibbles with the value of zero
* 12 nibbles containing the right-most 12 digits of the [[primary account number]] (PAN), excluding the [[check digit]]

=====Format 1=====
This format should be used where no PAN is available. The PIN block is constructed by concatenating the PIN with a transaction number thus:
* one nibble with the value of 1, which identifies this as a format 1 block
* one nibble encoding the length ''N'' of the PIN
* ''N'' nibbles, each encoding one PIN digit
* 14−''N'' nibbles encoding a unique value, which may be a transaction sequence number, time stamp or random number

=====Format 2=====
Format 2 is for local use with off-line systems only, e.g. [[smart cards]]. The PIN block is constructed by concatenating the PIN with a filler value thus:
* one nibble with the value of 2, which identifies this as a format 2 block
* one nibble encoding the length ''N'' of the PIN
* ''N'' nibbles, each encoding one PIN digit
* 14−''N'' nibbles, each holding the "fill" value 15 (i.e. 1111&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)
(Except for the format value in the first nibble, this is identical to the plain text PIN field of format 0.)

=====Format 3=====
Format 3 is the same as format 0, except that the "fill" digits are random values from 10 to 15, and the first nibble (which identifies the block format) has the value 3.

=====Extended PIN blocks=====
Formats 0 to 3 are all suitable for use with the [[Triple Data Encryption Algorithm]], as they correspond to its 64-bit [[Block size (cryptography)|block size]]. However the standard allows for other encryption algorithms with larger block sizes, e.g. the [[Advanced Encryption Standard]] has a block size of 128 bits. In such cases the PIN must be encoding into an ''extended PIN block'', the format of which is defined in a 2015 amendment to ISO 9564-1.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=61447 ISO 9564-1:2011/Amd 1:2015 ''Financial services &amp;mdash; Personal Identification Number (PIN) management and security &amp;mdash; Part 1: Basic principles and requirements for PINs in card-based systems AMENDMENT 1'']&lt;/ref&gt;

==Part 2: Approved algorithms for PIN encipherment==

ISO 9564-2:2014&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=61448 ISO 9564-2:2014 ''Financial services &amp;mdash; Personal Identification Number (PIN) management and security &amp;mdash; Part 2: Approved algorithms for PIN encipherment'']&lt;/ref&gt; specifies which encryption algorithms may be used for encrypting PINs. The approved algorithms are:
* [[Triple Data Encryption Algorithm]]
* [[RSA (cryptosystem)|RSA]];
* [[Advanced Encryption Standard]]

==Part 3 (withdrawn)==

ISO 9564-3 ''Part 3: Requirements for offline PIN handling in ATM and POS systems'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/iso_catalogue/catalogue_tc/catalogue_detail.htm?csnumber=35124 ISO 9564-3:2003 ''Banking &amp;mdash; Personal Identification Number management and security &amp;mdash; Part 3: Requirements for offline PIN handling in ATM and POS systems'']&lt;/ref&gt; most recently published in 2003, was withdrawn in 2011 and its contents merged into [[#Part 1: Basic principles and requirements for PINs in card-based system|part 1]].

==Part 4: Requirements for PIN handling in eCommerce for Payment Transactions==
{{Expand section|date=October 2016}}

ISO 9564-4:2016&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iso.org/iso/home/store/catalogue_ics/catalogue_detail_ics.htm?csnumber=61246 ISO 9564-4:2016 ''Financial services &amp;mdash; Personal Identification Number (PIN) management and security &amp;mdash; Part 4: Requirements for PIN handling in eCommerce for Payment Transactions'']&lt;/ref&gt; defines minimum security requirements and practices for the use of PINs and PIN entry devices in [[electronic commerce]].

In [[computing]], a '''legacy system''' is an old method, technology, [[computer system]], or [[Application software|application program]], "of, relating to, or being a previous or outdated computer system,"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Merriam-Webster|url=http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/legacy|accessdate=June 22, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; yet still in use. Often referencing a system as "legacy" means that it paved the way for the standards that would follow it. This can also imply that the system is out of date or in need of replacement.

== Overview ==
The source of the term "legacy" in a technical sense is [[Legacy preferences|its use in university admissions]]. In that context , a "legacy" is a [[euphemism]], used to describe someone receiving special treatment during admissions, because descended from an [[alumnus]].

The first use of the term "legacy" to describe computer systems probably occurred in the 1970s.  By the 1980s it was commonly used to refer to existing computer systems to distinguish them from the design and implementation of new systems. Legacy was often heard during a conversion process, for example, when moving data from the legacy system to a new database.

While this term may indicate that some engineers may feel that a system is out of date, a legacy system may continue to be used for a variety of reasons. It may simply be that the system still provides for the users' needs. In addition, the decision to keep an old system may be influenced by economic reasons such as [[return on investment]] challenges or [[vendor lock-in]], the inherent challenges of [[change management]], or a variety of other reasons other than functionality. [[Backward compatibility]] (such as the ability of newer systems to handle legacy [[file format]]s and [[character encoding]]s) is a goal that [[software developer]]s often include in their work.

Even if it is no longer used, a legacy system may continue to impact the organization due to its historical role. Historic data may not have been converted into the new system format and may exist within the new system with the use of a customized [[schema crosswalk]], or may exist only in a [[data warehouse]]. In either case, the effect on [[business intelligence]] and [[operational reporting]] can be significant.  A legacy system may include procedures or terminology which are no longer relevant in the current context, and may hinder or confuse understanding of the methods or technologies used.

Organizations can have compelling reasons for keeping a legacy system, such as:
* The system works satisfactorily, and the owner sees no reason to change it.
* The costs of redesigning or replacing the system are prohibitive because it is large, [[monolithic system|monolithic]], and/or complex.
* Retraining on a new system would be costly in lost time and money, compared to the anticipated appreciable benefits of replacing it (which may be zero).
* The system requires near-constant [[availability]], so it cannot be taken out of service, and the cost of designing a new system with a similar availability level is high. Examples include systems to handle customers' accounts in [[bank]]s, [[computer reservations system]]s, [[air traffic control]], energy distribution ([[power grid]]s), [[nuclear power plant]]s, military defense installations, and systems such as the [[TOPS]] database.
* The way that the system works is not well understood. Such a situation can occur when the designers of the system have left the organization, and the system has either not been fully documented or documentation has been lost.
* The user expects that the system can easily be replaced when this becomes necessary.
* Newer systems perform undesirable (especially for individual or non-institutional users) secondary functions such as ''a'') tracking and reporting of user activity and/or ''b'') automatic updating that creates "[[Backdoor (computing)|back-door]]" security vulnerabilities and leaves end users dependent on the good faith and honesty of the vendor providing the updates.  This problem is especially acute when these secondary functions of a newer system cannot be disabled.

==Problems posed by legacy computing==
Legacy systems are considered to be potentially problematic by some software engineers for several reasons.&lt;ref&gt;(for example, see Bisbal et al., 1999).&lt;/ref&gt;
* If legacy [[software]] runs on only antiquated [[computer hardware|hardware]], the cost of maintaining the system may eventually outweigh the cost of replacing both the software and hardware unless some form of [[emulator|emulation]] or [[backward compatibility]] allows the software to run on new hardware.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lamb|first1=John|title=Legacy systems continue to have a place in the enterprise|url=http://www.computerweekly.com/feature/Legacy-systems-continue-to-have-a-place-in-the-enterprise|accessdate=27 October 2014|work=Computer Weekly|date=June 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* These systems can be hard to maintain, improve, and expand because there is a general lack of understanding of the system; the staff who were experts on it have retired or forgotten what they knew about it, and staff who entered the field after it became "legacy" never learned about it in the first place. This can be worsened by lack or loss of documentation. [[Comair]] airline company fired its CEO in 2004 due to the failure of an antiquated legacy crew scheduling system that ran into a limitation not known to anyone in the company.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stephanie Overby |url=http://www.cio.com/article/112103/Comair_s_Christmas_Disaster_Bound_To_Fail |title=Comair's Christmas Disaster: Bound To Fail - CIO.com - Business Technology Leadership |publisher=CIO.com |date=2005-05-01 |accessdate=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Legacy systems may have vulnerabilities in older operating systems or applications due to lack of security patches being available or applied. There can also be production configurations that cause security problems. These issues can put the legacy system at risk of being compromised by attackers or knowledgeable insiders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Razermouse |url=http://www.mousesecurity.com/?p=220 |title=The Danger of Legacy Systems |publisher=Mousesecurity.com |date=2011-05-03 |accessdate=2012-04-29 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120323165836/http://www.mousesecurity.com/?p=220 |archivedate=March 23, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Integration with newer systems may also be difficult because new software may use completely different technologies.  Integration across technology is quite common in computing, but integration between newer technologies and substantially older ones is not common.  There may simply not be sufficient demand for integration technology to be developed.  Some of this "glue" code is occasionally developed by vendors and enthusiasts of particular legacy technologies.
*Budgetary constraints often lead corporations to not address the need of replacement or migration of a legacy system. However, companies often don’t consider the increasing supportability costs (people, software and hardware, all mentioned above) and do not take into consideration the enormous loss of capability or business continuity if the legacy system were to fail. Once these considerations are well understood, then based on the proven ROI of a new, more secure, updated technology stack platform is not as costly as the alternative - and the budget is found.
*Due to the fact that most legacy programmers are entering retirement age and the number of young engineers replacing them is very small, there is an alarming shortage of available workforce. This in turn results in difficulty in maintaining legacy systems, as well as an increase in costs of procuring experienced programmers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.modernizationhub.com|title=Benefits of Mainframe Modernization|last=|first=|date=|website=Modernization Hub|language=en-US|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2017-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Improvements on legacy software systems==
Where it is impossible to replace legacy systems through the practice of [[application retirement]], it is still possible to enhance (or "re-face") them. Most development often goes into adding new interfaces to a legacy system.  The most prominent technique is to provide a Web-based interface to a terminal-based mainframe application. This may reduce staff productivity due to slower response times and slower mouse-based operator actions, yet it is often seen as an "upgrade", because the interface style is familiar to unskilled users and is easy for them to use. John McCormick discusses such strategies that involve [[Middleware (distributed applications)|middleware]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jun 02, 2000 |url=http://www.gcn.com/state/vol6_no6/guide/748-1.html |title=Mainframe-web middleware - John McCormick |publisher=Gcn.com |date=2000-06-02 |accessdate=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Printing improvements are problematic because legacy software systems often add no formatting instructions, or they use protocols that are not usable in modern PC/Windows printers. A print server can be used to intercept the data and translate it to a more modern code. [[Rich Text Format|Rich Text Format (RTF)]] or [[PostScript]] documents may be created in the legacy application and then interpreted at a PC before being printed.

Biometric security measures are difficult to implement on legacy systems.  A workable solution is to use a [[telnet]] or [[http]] proxy server to sit between users and the mainframe to implement secure access to the legacy application.

The change being undertaken in some organizations is to switch to [[automated business process]] (ABP) software which generates complete systems. These systems can then interface to the organizations' legacy systems and use them as [[Information repository|data repositories]]. This approach can provide a number of significant benefits: the users are insulated from the inefficiencies of their legacy systems, and the changes can be incorporated quickly and easily in the ABP software.

[[Model-driven engineering|Model-driven]] [[reverse engineering|reverse]] and [[forward engineering]] approaches can be also used for the improvement of legacy software.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = Software modernization and cloudification using the ARTIST migration methodology and framework | publisher = Scalable Computing: Practice and Experience (SCPE) | year = 2014 | volume = 15 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.12694/scpe.v15i2.980 | doi = 10.12694/scpe.v15i2.980}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==NASA example==

Andreas Hein, from the Technical University of Munich, researched the use of legacy systems in space exploration.  According to Hein, legacy systems are attractive for reuse if an organization has the capabilities for verification, validation, testing, and operational history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = A.M. Hein | title = How to Assess Heritage Systems in the Early Phases? | publisher = ESA | series = 6th International Systems &amp; Concurrent Engineering for Space Applications Conference 2014  | year = 2014 | url = https://www.academia.edu/8441540/How_to_Assess_Heritage_Systems_in_the_Early_Phases }}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = A.M. Hein | title = Heritage Technologies in Space Programs - Assessment Methodology and Statistical Analysis | publisher = Technical University of Munich | series = PhD thesis Faculty of Mechanical Engineering  | year = 2016 | url = https://www.researchgate.net/publication/310478449_Heritage_Technologies_in_Space_Programs_-_Assessment_Methodology_and_Statistical_Analysis }}&lt;/ref&gt; These capabilities must be integrated into various software life cycle phases such as development, implementation, usage, or maintenance. For software systems, the capability to use and maintain the system are crucial. Otherwise the system will become less and less understandable and maintainable.

According to Hein, verification, validation, testing, and operational history increases the confidence in a system's reliability and quality. However, accumulating this history is often expensive. NASA's now retired [[Space Shuttle]] program used a large amount of 1970s-era technology. Replacement was cost-prohibitive because of the expensive requirement for flight certification.  The original hardware completed the expensive integration and certification requirement for flight, but any new equipment would have had to go through that entire process again.  This long and detailed process required extensive tests of the new components in their new configurations before a single unit could be used in the Space Shuttle program. Thus any new system that started the certification process becomes a ''[[de facto]]'' legacy system by the time it is approved for flight.

Additionally, the entire Space Shuttle system, including ground and launch vehicle assets, was designed to work together as a closed system.  Since the specifications did not change, all of the certified systems and components performed well in the roles for which they were designed.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | author = A.M. Hein | title = How to Assess Heritage Systems in the Early Phases? | publisher = ESA | series = 6th International Systems &amp; Concurrent Engineering for Space Applications Conference 2014 | year = 2014 | url = https://www.academia.edu/8441540/How_to_Assess_Heritage_Systems_in_the_Early_Phases| page =3 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even before the Shuttle was scheduled to be retired in 2010, NASA found it advantageous to keep using many pieces of 1970s technology rather than to upgrade those systems and recertify the new components.

==Additional uses of the term ''Legacy'' in computing==
The term ''legacy support'' is often used in conjunction with legacy systems. The term may refer to a feature of modern software.  For example, [[Operating system]]s with "legacy support" can detect and use older hardware. The term may also be used to refer to a business function; e.g.  A software or hardware vendor that is supporting, or providing [[software maintenance]], for older products.

A "legacy" product may be a product that is no longer sold, has lost substantial market share, or is a version of a product that is not current.  A legacy product may have some advantage over a modern product making it appealing for customers to keep it around. A product is only truly "obsolete" if it has [[Pareto efficiency|an advantage to nobody]] – if no person making a rational decision would choose to acquire it new.

The term "legacy mode" often refers specifically to [[backward compatibility]]. A software product that is capable of performing as though it were a previous version of itself, is said to be "running in legacy mode."  This kind of feature is common in operating systems and internet browsers, where many applications depend on these underlying components.

The [[Mainframe computer|computer mainframe]] era saw many applications running in legacy mode. In the modern business computing environment, [[n-tier]], or [[3-tier]] [[Computer architecture|architectures]] are more difficult to place into legacy mode as they include many components making up a single system.

[[Virtual machine|Virtualization]] technology is a recent innovation allowing legacy systems to continue to operate on modern hardware by running older operating systems and browsers on a software system that emulates legacy hardware.

==Brownfield architecture==

Programmers have borrowed the term [[Brownfield land|''brownfield'']] from the construction industry, where  previously developed land (often polluted and abandoned) is described as ''brownfield''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://searchunifiedcommunications.techtarget.com/sDefinition/0,,sid186_gci1062754,00.html |title=Definition of greenfield and brownfield deployment |publisher=Searchunifiedcommunications.techtarget.com |date= |accessdate=2012-04-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* ''Brownfield architecture'' is a type of software or network architecture that incorporates legacy systems.
* ''Brownfield deployment'' is an upgrade or addition to an existing software or network architecture that retains legacy components.

==Alternative view==
There is an alternate favorable opinion &amp;mdash; growing since the end of the Dotcom bubble in 1999 &amp;mdash; that legacy systems are simply computer systems in working use:

{{quote|"[[Legacy code]]" often differs from its suggested alternative by actually working and scaling.|[[q:Bjarne Stroustrup|Bjarne Stroustrup, creator of C++]]}}

IT analysts estimate that the cost of replacing [[business logic]] is about five times that of reuse,{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} even discounting the risk of system failures and security breaches. Ideally, businesses would never have to [[Rewrite (programming)|rewrite]] most core business logic: ''debits = credits'' is a perennial requirement. 

The IT industry is responding with "legacy modernization" and "legacy transformation": refurbishing existing business logic with new user interfaces, sometimes using [[screen scraping]] and service-enabled access through [[web service]]s. These techniques allow organizations to understand their existing code assets (using discovery tools), provide new user and application interfaces to existing code, improve workflow, contain costs, minimize risk, and enjoy classic qualities of service (near 100% uptime, security, scalability, etc.).{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

This trend also invites reflection on what makes legacy systems so durable. Technologists are relearning the importance of sound [[Computer architecture|architecture]] from the start, to avoid costly and risky rewrites. The most common legacy systems tend to be those which embraced well-known IT architectural principles, with careful planning and strict methodology during implementation. Poorly designed systems often don't last, both because they wear out and because their inherent faults invite replacement. Thus, many organizations are rediscovering the value of both their legacy systems and the theortical underpinnings of those systems.

This is a list of notable [[copy protection]] schemes for CD and DVD.

For other medias, see [[List of copy protection schemes|List of Copy Protection Schemes]].

== Commercial CD protection schemes ==
&lt;!-- Please only add schemes which have their own article.--&gt;
; [[CD-Cops]]
: Requires the user to enter CD-code (or reads embedded CD-code) that describes geometry of CD to correctly locate data on the disc.
; [[SafeDisc|SafeDisc (versions 1-5)]]
: Adds unique digital signature at the time of manufacturing which is designed to be difficult to copy or transfer so that software is able to detect copied media.
; SafeCast
: The encryption key will expire after pre-determined date so the media can be used only temporarily. Also used to implement trial editions of programs.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite press|url=https://www.thefreelibrary.com/Macrovision+Unveils+SAFECAST+Copy+Protection+Solution;+SAFECAST...-a054129804|title=Macrovision Unveils SAFECAST Copy Protection Solution; SAFECAST Technology Designed to Secure Pre-Release Software from Unauthorized Copying. - Free Online Library|website=www.thefreelibrary.com|date=March 17, 1999|access-date=2018-09-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[SecuROM]]
: Limits the number of PCs activated at the same time from the same key.
; StarForce
: Asks for Serial ID at install or startup to verify the license.
; [[TAGES]]
: Verifies authentic copy by checking existence of "twin sectors" which are sectors with same logical address but different data. However, twin sectors may be hard to read in order to copy but are easy to write.

== Commercial DVD protection schemes ==
&lt;!-- Please only add schemes which have their own article.--&gt;
; [[Analog Protection System]]
: Adds pulses to analog video signals to negatively impact the [[Automatic gain control|AGC]] circuit of a recording device so the images on copied DVDs becomes garbled.
; [[ARccOS Protection|Sony ARccOS Protection]]
: Inserting corrupted sectors in areas where normal players will not access but ripping software does to trigger errors during replication.
; [[Burst Cutting Area]]
: Writing barcode in circular area near the center of the disc (referred to as burst cutting area) which cannot be written without using special equipment.
; [[DVD-Cops]]
: See CD-Cops in previous section.
; [[DVD region code]]
: Restricts region where media can be played by matching region number with configuration flag in DVD players.
; [[LaserLock]]
: Includes hidden directory on the CD containing corrupted data which will cause errors while being copied.
; ProtectDISC Software
: Adds unique digital signature to the CD or DVD that cannot be transferred from copy to copy. A solution for software and games on CD or DVD provided by [[Protect Software]].
; ProtectDISC Video
: Prevents ripping software to analyze the structure of the DVD. A solution for Video-DVDs provided by [[Protect Software]].
; [[SafeDisc|SafeDisc (version 4)]]
: See SafeDisc (versions 1-5) in previous section.
; [[SecuROM]]
: See previous section.
; [[TAGES]]
: See previous section.

== Commercial Audio CD/DVD protection schemes ==
&lt;!-- Please only add schemes which have their own article.--&gt;
; [[Cactus Data Shield]]
: By intentionally violating [[Red Book (audio CD standard)|Red Book]] CD Digital Audio standards, such as erroneous disc navigation and corrupted data, prevents successful ripping of the data. However, the original disc itself does not play correctly in some CD/DVD players.
; Wavy data track&lt;ref&gt;&lt;!--{{US Patent|US6304971B1}}--&gt;{{Cite web|title=Digital compact disc player security system reproducing method and apparatus|url=https://patents.google.com/patent/US6304971B1/en &lt;!--|issue-date=1999-08-16|access-date=2018-09-23 --&gt;}}&lt;/ref&gt;
: Discs' data track is wavy instead of straight, so only discs with the same wavy-shaped data track will be playable.
; [[Extended Copy Protection|Extended Copy Protection (XCP)]]
: Installs software on the computer after agreement to [[EULA]] at the first time the media is inserted, and the software will watch for any ripper software trying to access the CD-drive. This copy protection can be defeated simply by using a computer that is not running [[Microsoft Windows]], not using an account with administrative privileges, or preventing the installer from running, and has long since been discontinued due to a [[Sony BMG copy protection rootkit scandal|public relations disaster]] caused by the software behaving identically to a [[rootkit]].
; [[Key2Audio]]
: Another deliberate violation of the Red Book standard intended to make the CD play only on CD players and not on computers by applying bogus data track onto the disc during manufacturing, which CD players will ignore as non-audio tracks. The system could be disabled by tracing the outer edge of a CD with a felt-tip marker.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/11/17/interview-bohemia-interactives-ceo-on-fighting-piracy-creative-drm/ | title = Can You Violate Copyright Law With a Magic Marker? | accessdate = 2013-02-11 | last = Coerner | first = Brendan | date = 3 June 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[MediaMax CD3]]
: Installs software on the computer that tries to play the media so other software cannot read data directly from audio discs in the CD-ROM drive. Silently installing software on a computer created a controversy about modifying a computer's behaviour without a user's consent.

: Multiple [[TOC (CD)|table of contents]] (TOC) made normal cd player to not read beyond first track. However, one could read GD-ROM on CD reader by swapping the disc after reading fake TOC.
; [[FADE]]
: Creates fake scratches on the disk image which copying programs will automatically try to fix. Instead of alerting the user that the copied disc is detected, the program will play the game in buggy manner.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = http://www.pcgamer.com/2011/11/17/interview-bohemia-interactives-ceo-on-fighting-piracy-creative-drm/ | title = Interview: Bohemia Interactive’s CEO on fighting piracy, creative DRM | accessdate = 2013-02-11 | last = Grayson | first = Nathan | date = 17 Nov 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
; [[PlayStation]] (CD-ROM)
: The authority pattern pressed on internal circumference of the media, which could not be copied, is used to detect authorized copies. Some titles also uses Libcrypt mechanism to validate the disc by using [[checksum]] as magic number to subroutines.
; [[PlayStation 2]] (CD-ROM, DVD-ROM)
: A map file that contains all of the exact positions and file size info of the disc is stored at a position that is beyond the file limit. The game calls this place directly so that burned copy with no data beyond file limit cannot be played.
; [[PlayStation Portable|PSP]] ([[Universal Media Disc]])
: Since no blank media or writer exists, the media itself cannot be copied, but one could make [[ISO image]] (a file version of the UMD) on a memory card. The unique format also made the media difficult to adapt and expensive.
; [[Xbox (console)|Xbox]] (DVD)
: It has been theorized that the discs have a second partition that is read from the outside in (opposite current standards thus making the second partition unreadable in PC DVD drives). Also, the Xbox is said to use a different DVD file system (instead of UDF).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8978">The '''MPLAB''' series of devices are [[Programmer (hardware)|programmer]]s and [[In-circuit emulator|debugger]]s for [[Microchip Technology|Microchip]] [[PIC microcontroller|PIC and dsPIC]] [[microcontroller]]s, developed by [[Microchip Technology]].

The ICD family of [[In-circuit emulator|debugger]]s has been produced since the release of the first Flash-based PIC microcontrollers, and the latest ICD 3 currently supports all current PIC and dsPIC devices. It is the most popular combination debugging/programming tool from Microchip.

The REAL ICE [[In-circuit emulator|emulator]] is similar to the ICD, with the addition of better debugging features, and various add-on modules that expand its usage scope. The ICE is a family of discontinued in-circuit emulators for PIC and dsPIC devices, and is currently superseded by the REAL ICE.

==MPLAB ICD==
The '''MPLAB ICD''' is the first in-circuit debugger product by Microchip, and is currently discontinued and superseded by ICD 2.&lt;ref name="icd1"&gt;[http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/51192c.pdf MPLAB®ICD Kit], Microchip&lt;/ref&gt; The ICD connected to the engineer's PC via [[RS-232]], and connected to the device via ICSP.&lt;ref name="icd1"/&gt;

The ICD supported devices within the PIC16C and PIC16F families, and supported full speed execution, or single step interactive debugging.&lt;ref name="icd1"/&gt; Only one hardware breakpoint was supported by the ICD.&lt;ref name="icd1"/&gt;

==MPLAB ICD 2==
[[File:MPLAB ICD2.png|thumb|The MPLAB ICD 2]]
The '''MPLAB ICD 2''' is a discontinued in-circuit debugger and programmer by Microchip, and is currently superseded by ICD 3.&lt;ref name="icd2"&gt;[http://www.microchip.com/DevelopmentTools/ProductDetails.aspx?PartNO=dv164005 MPLAB ICD 2 In-Circuit Debugger], Microchip&lt;/ref&gt; The ICD 2 connects to the engineer's PC via USB or [[RS-232]], and connects to the device via ICSP.&lt;ref name="icd2b"&gt;[http://ww1.microchip.com/downloads/en/DeviceDoc/51264B.pdf MPLAB®ICD 2 In-Circuit Debugger/Programmer], Microchip&lt;/ref&gt;

The ICD 2 supports most PIC and dsPIC devices within the PIC10, PIC12, PIC16, PIC18, dsPIC, rfPIC and PIC32 families,&lt;ref&gt;[http://nnp.ucsd.edu/phy120b/pic_manuals_pdf/Readme_for_MPLAB_ICD_2.htm Release Notes for MPLAB® ICD 2 In-Circuit Debugger], University of California&lt;/ref&gt; and supports full speed execution, or single step interactive debugging.&lt;ref name="icd2b"/&gt; At breakpoints, data and program memory can be read and modified using the [[MPLAB]] IDE.&lt;ref name="icd2"/&gt; The ICD 2 firmware is field upgradeable using the [[MPLAB]] IDE.&lt;ref name="icd2"/&gt;

The ICD 2 can be used to erase, program or reprogram PIC MCU program memory, while the device is installed on target hardware, using ICSP.&lt;ref name="icd2"/&gt; Target device voltages from 2.0V to 6.0V are supported.&lt;ref name="icd2"/&gt;

==MPLAB ICD 3==
[[File:MPLAB ICD3.png|thumb|The MPLAB ICD 3]]
The '''MPLAB ICD 3''' is an in-circuit debugger and programmer by Microchip, and is the latest in the ICD series.&lt;ref name="icd3"&gt;[http://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails.aspx?PartNO=DV164035 MPLAB ICD 3 In-Circuit Debugger], Microchip&lt;/ref&gt; The ICD 3 connects to the engineer's PC via USB, and connects to the device via ICSP.&lt;ref name="icd3"/&gt; The ICD 3 is entirely USB-bus-powered, and is 15x faster than the ICD 2 for programming devices.&lt;ref name="icd3"/&gt;

The ICD 3 supports all current PIC and dsPIC devices within the PIC10, PIC12, PIC16, PIC18, dsPIC, rfPIC and PIC32 families, and supports full speed execution, or single step interactive debugging.&lt;ref name="icd3"/&gt; At breakpoints, data and program memory can be read and modified using the [[MPLAB]] IDE.&lt;ref name="icd3"/&gt; The ICD 3 firmware is field upgradeable using the [[MPLAB]] IDE.&lt;ref name="icd3"/&gt;

The ICD 3 can be used to erase, program or reprogram PIC MCU program memory, while the device is installed on target hardware, using ICSP.&lt;ref name="icd3"/&gt; Target device voltages from 2.0V to 5.5V are supported.&lt;ref name="icd3"/&gt;

The ICD 3 has over-voltage protection in the probe drivers to guard against power surges from the target.&lt;ref name="icd3"/&gt; All lines have over-current protection. The ICD 3 can also provide power to a target, up to 100 [[Ampere|mA]].&lt;ref name="icd3"/&gt;

==MPLAB REAL ICE==
[[File:MPLAB REALICE.png|thumb|The MPLAB REAL ICE]]
The '''MPLAB REAL ICE''' ('''I'''n-'''C'''ircuit '''E'''mulator) is a high-speed emulator for Microchip devices. It debugs and programs PIC and dsPIC microcontrollers in conjunction with the [[MPLAB]] IDE, while the target device is "in-circuit".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails.aspx?PartNO=DV244005 MPLAB REAL ICE In-Circuit Emulator], Microchip Website&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b2"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=O4XNBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA519&amp;dq=mplab+REAL+ICE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCAQ6AEwAQ Microcontrollers: High-Performance Systems and Programming], CRC Press, 28-Oct-2013&lt;/ref&gt; The REAL ICE is significantly faster than the ICD 2, for programming and debugging.&lt;ref name="b1"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=r7ihP8HDd2cC&amp;pg=PA214&amp;dq=mplab+REAL+ICE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CBsQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=mplab%20REAL%20ICE&amp;f=false Programming the PIC Microcontroller], Tata McGraw-Hill Education&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="b4"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=pdbf2HuMzREC&amp;pg=PA157&amp;dq=mplab+REAL+ICE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCYQ6AEwAjgK#v=onepage&amp;q=mplab%20REAL%20ICE&amp;f=false PIC Microcontrollers: An Introduction to Microelectronics], Elsevier, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The REAL ICE connects to the engineer's [[Personal computer|PC]] via a [[USB]] 2.0 interface, and connects to the target device via [[In-circuit serial programming|ICSP]] (PGC/PGD programming pins), typically using a RJ11 connector. [[Low-voltage differential signaling|LVDS]] is also available for high-speed data transfer between the device and the REAL ICE. MPLAB REAL ICE is field upgradeable through firmware downloads in MPLAB IDE.

The REAL ICE supports 8-bit devices (PIC10, PIC12, PIC16, PIC18), 16-bit devices (PIC24, dsPIC) and 32-bit devices (PIC32MX).&lt;ref name="b3"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=PTcNpClUH1QC&amp;pg=PR25&amp;dq=mplab+REAL+ICE&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCcQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=mplab%20REAL%20ICE&amp;f=false Programming 32-bit Microcontrollers in C: Exploring the PIC32], Newnes, 08-Apr-2011&lt;/ref&gt;

===Performance Pak===
The REAL ICE Performance Pak is an optional add-on to the REAL ICE, that consists of a High Speed Probe Driver and Receiver that employ two CAT5 cables.&lt;ref name="ripp"&gt;[http://www.microchipdirect.com/ProductSearch.aspx?Keywords=ac244002 MPLAB REAL ICE PERFORMANCE PAK], Microchip Direct&lt;/ref&gt; Debug pins are driven using LVDS communications, and the additional trace connections allow high speed serial trace uploads to the PC.&lt;ref name="ripp"/&gt;

===Isolator===
The REAL ICE Isolator is an optional add-on to the REAL ICE, that enables connectivity to AC and High-voltage applications not referenced to ground.&lt;ref name="rii"&gt;[http://www.microchipdirect.com/ProductSearch.aspx?Keywords=AC244005 MPLAB REAL ICE Isolator], Microchip Direct&lt;/ref&gt; Control signals are magnetically or optically isolated providing up to 2.5 kV equivalent isolation protection.&lt;ref name="rii"/&gt; The isolator acts as an isolated bridge, where signals are passed through with complete transparency to the MPLAB REAL ICE or [[MPLAB]] IDE.&lt;ref name="rii"/&gt;

==MPLAB ICE2000==
The '''MPLAB ICE2000''' is a discontinued in-circuit emulator for PIC and dsPIC devices.&lt;ref name="b5"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=3mIfLv_vhqsC&amp;pg=PR15&amp;dq=MPLAB+ICE2000&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCgQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=MPLAB%20ICE2000&amp;f=false Networking and Internetworking with Microcontrollers], Elsevier, 30-Apr-2004&lt;/ref&gt; It has been superseded by the REAL ICE.

The ICE2000 connects to the engineer's PC via a [[parallel port]] interface, and a USB converter is available. The ICE2000 requires emulator modules, and the test hardware must provide a socket which can take either an emulator module, or a production device.

==MPLAB ICE4000==
[[File:MPLAB ICE4000.png|thumb|The MPLAB ICE4000]]
The '''MPLAB ICE4000''' is a discontinued in-circuit emulator for PIC and dsPIC devices.&lt;ref name="b5"/&gt; It has been superseded by the REAL ICE.&lt;ref name="ice4k"&gt;[http://www.microchip.com/Developmenttools/ProductDetails.aspx?PartNO=ICE4000 MPLAB® ICE 4000], Microchip&lt;/ref&gt; The ICE4000 is no longer directly advertised on Microchip's website, and Microchip states that it is not recommended for new designs.&lt;ref name="ice4k"/&gt;

The ICE4000 connects to the engineer's PC via a USB 2.0 interface. PIC devices under debug with the ICE4000 ran at full speed, and the emulator supported unlimited breakpoints, and complex break/trigger logic.&lt;ref name="ice4k"/&gt; The emulator supported multiple external inputs and external outputs to sync with other instruments.&lt;ref name="ice4k"/&gt;

==Description==
''Pongamia pinnata (L.) Pierre'' is a [[legume]] tree that grows to about {{convert|15|-|25|m|ft|round=5}} in height with a large [[canopy (biology)|canopy]] which spreads equally wide. It may be [[deciduous]] for short periods. It has a straight or crooked trunk, {{convert|50|-|80|cm|round=5}} in diameter, with grey-brown bark which is smooth or vertically fissured. Branches are glabrous with pale [[stipule|stipulate]] scars. The [[imparipinnate]] leaves of the tree alternate and are short-stalked, rounded or [[leaf shape|cuneate]] at the base, ovate or oblong along the length, obtuse-acuminate at the apex, and not toothed on the edges. They are a soft, shiny burgundy when young and mature to a glossy, deep green as the season progresses with prominent veins underneath.&lt;ref name=WorldAgro&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldagroforestry.org/treedb2/AFTPDFS/Pongamia_pinnata.pdf |title=Pongamia pinnata; Fabaceae - Papilionoideae; (L.)

Flowering generally starts after 3–4 years with small clusters of white, purple, and pink [[flower]]s blossoming throughout the year. The [[raceme]]-like [[inflorescence]] bear two to four flowers which are strongly [[fragrant]] and grow to be {{convert|15|-|18|mm}} long. The [[Sepal|calyx]] of the flowers is bell-shaped and truncate, while the [[petal|corolla]] is a rounded ovate shape with basal auricles and often with a central blotch of green color.&lt;ref name=AustRFK6.1-2010/&gt;&lt;ref name=daff_AU&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.daff.qld.gov.au/__data/assets/pdf_file/0003/67575/IPA-Pongamia-Risk-Assessment.pdf |title=Weed Risk Assessment : Pongamia |publisher=Daff.qld.gov.au |accessdate=2013-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Croppings of [[indehiscent]] pods can occur by 4–6 years. The brown seed pods appear immediately after flowering and mature in 10 to 11 months. The pods are thick-walled, smooth, somewhat flattened and elliptical, but slightly curved with a short, curved point. The pods contain within them one or two bean-like brownish-red seeds, but because they do not split open naturally the pods need to decompose before the seeds can germinate. The seeds are about {{convert|1.5|-|2.5|cm}} long with a brittle, oily coat and are unpalatable to herbivores.&lt;ref name=WorldAgro/&gt;&lt;ref name=daff_AU/&gt;

The tree is well suited to intense heat and sunlight and its dense network of lateral roots and its thick, long [[taproot]] make it drought-tolerant. The dense shade it provides slows the evaporation of surface water and its [[root nodules]] promote [[nitrogen fixation]], a symbiotic process by which gaseous [[nitrogen]] (N&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) from the air is converted into [[ammonium]] (NH&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, a form of nitrogen available to the plant). M. pinnata is also a [[Freshwater swamp forest|fresh water flooded forest]] species as it can survive total submergence in sweet water for few months continuously. M. pinnata tree is the pioneer tree in [[Ratargul Swamp Forest|Ratargul fresh water flooded forest]] in [[Bangladesh]] and [[Tonlé Sap|Tonlesap]] lake swamp forests in [[Cambodia]]

''Millettia pinnata'' is an [[outbreeding]] [[diploid]] legume tree, with a diploid [[chromosome]] number of 22.&lt;ref name=daff_AU/&gt; Root nodules are of the determinate type (as those on soybean and common bean) formed by the causative bacterium ''[[Bradyrhizobium]]''.

==Uses==
[[File:Pongamia pinnata.jpg|thumb|Millettia pinnata is renowned for its shade and is well known in traditional uses for its medicinal properties. It is also grown as a host plant for [[lac]] insects. The tree is also one of the food plants for Common Cerulean (''[[Jamides celeno]]''). The seeds contain pongam oil that is now being explored as an alternate fuel source.]]

''Pongamia pinnata (L.) Pierre'' is well-adapted to [[arid]] zones and has many traditional uses. It is often used for landscaping purposes as a [[windbreak]] or for shade due to the large canopy and showy fragrant flowers. The flowers are used by gardeners as compost for plants requiring rich [[nutrients]]. The bark can be used to make twine or rope and it also yields a black gum that has historically been used to treat wounds caused by poisonous fish. The wood is said to be beautifully grained but splits easily when sawn thus relegating it to [[firewood]], posts, and tool handles.&lt;ref name="Winrock" /&gt;

While the oil and residue of the plant are [[toxic]] and will induce nausea and vomiting if ingested, the fruits and sprouts, along with the seeds, are used in many traditional remedies.&lt;ref name="Purdue" /&gt; Juices from the plant, as well as the oil, are [[antiseptic]]{{medcn|date=January 2016}} and resistant to pests. In addition ''M. pinnata'' has the rare property of producing seeds of 25–40% [[lipid]] content of which nearly half is [[oleic acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cilr.uq.edu.au/UserImages/File/factsheets/Pongamia%20Binder1.pdf |title=Pongamia Factsheet |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oil made from the seeds, known as [[pongamia oil]], is an important asset of this tree and has been used as [[Oil lamp|lamp oil]], in [[soap]] making, and as a [[lubricant]] for thousands of years. The oil has a high content of [[triglycerides]], and its disagreeable taste and odor are due to bitter [[flavonoid]] constituents including [[karanjin]], [[pongamol]], [[tannin]] and [[karanjachromene]].&lt;ref name="Purdue"/&gt; It can be grown in [[rainwater harvesting]] ponds up to {{convert|6|m|ft|abbr=on}} in water depth without losing its greenery and remaining useful for biodiesel production.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.scribd.com/doc/58789361/Rain-Water-Harvesting-by-Freshwater-Flooded-Forests |title=Rain water harvesting by fresh water flooded forests |publisher=Scribd.com |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The residue of oil extraction, called press cake, is used as a fertilizer and as animal feed for ruminants and poultry.&lt;ref&gt;Heuzé V., Tran G., Delagarde R., Hassoun P., Bastianelli D., Lebas F., 2017. Karanja (Millettia pinnata). Feedipedia, a programme by INRA, CIRAD, AFZ and FAO. https://www.feedipedia.org/node/636&lt;/ref&gt;

Long used as shade tree, ''M. pinnata'' is heavily self-seeding and can spread lateral roots up to {{convert|9|m|ft|abbr=on}} over its lifetime. If not managed carefully it can quickly become a weed leading some, including [[Miami-Dade County]], to label the tree as an [[invasive species]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://miami-dade.ifas.ufl.edu/old/programs/urbanhort/publications/PDF/Miami-Dade-County-Invasive-Plants.pdf |title=Miam-Dade County Invasive Plants |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; However this dense network of lateral roots makes this tree ideal for controlling [[soil erosion]] and binding [[sand dunes]].&lt;ref name="Winrock" /&gt;

=== Research efforts ===
The seed oil has been found to be useful in diesel generators and, along with ''[[Jatropha]]'' and [[Castor oil plant|Castor]], it is being explored in hundreds of projects throughout India and the third world as feedstock for [[biodiesel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|pmid=15939268|year=2005|last1=Karmee|first1=SK|last2=Chadha|first2=A|title=Preparation of biodiesel from crude oil of Pongamia pinnata|volume=96|issue=13|pages=1425–9|doi=10.1016/j.biortech.2004.12.011|journal=Bioresource Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is especially attractive because it grows naturally through much of arid India, having very deep roots to reach water, and is one of the few crops well-suited to commercialization by India's large population of rural poor. Several unelectrified villages have recently used [[pongamia oil]], simple processing techniques, and diesel generators to create their own grid systems to run water pumps and electric lighting.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tve.org/ho/doc.cfm?aid=1433&amp;lang=English |title=On Biodiesel |publisher=Tve.org |date= |accessdate=2013-09-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120426092429/http://tve.org/ho/doc.cfm?aid=1433&amp;lang=English |archivedate=April 26, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1997, the [[Indian Institute of Science]] started researching and promoting the use of the seed oil as a [[vegetable oil fuel]] for stationary generators for electricity and irrigation pumps in the rural areas of [[Karnataka]] and [[Andhra Pradesh|Andhra]]. The program, SuTRA, successfully demonstrated the sustainability of such oil use in several villages all over India.{{citation needed|date=December 2011}}

In 2003, the [[Himalayan Institute of Yoga Science and Philosophy]] as part of its Biofuel Rural Development Initiative started a campaign of education and public awareness to rural farmers about ''M. pinnata'' in two Indian states. One of the Himalayan Institute's partners developed a consistently high yield [[grafting|scion]] that reduced the time it takes to mature from 10 years to as little as three. To help the farmers in the transition from traditional crops to ''M. pinnata'' the Indian government has contributed over $30 million in low-interest loans and donated 4.5 million kg (5,000&amp;nbsp;[[short ton]]s) of rice to sustain impoverished drought-stricken farmers until the trees begin to produce income. Since the project began in 2003 over 20 million trees have been planted and 45,000 farmers are now involved.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.himalayaninstitute.org/Humanitarian/BiofuelsEnergyFarming.aspx Himalayan Institute] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070825002528/http://www.himalayaninstitute.org/humanitarian/biofuelsenergyfarming.aspx |date=2007-08-25 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:plantationpre.jpg|thumb|left|Pacific Renewable Energy trial plantation in [[Caboolture, Queensland]].]]
In 2006, the Himalayan Institute began looking at locations in Africa to transplant ''M. pinnata'' into. Initially they began in [[Uganda]] but due to the lack of [[infrastructure]] and growing [[desertification]] the project has been growing very slowly. They have also begun a project in the [[Kumbo]] region of [[Cameroon]] where conditions are better. There has been some suggestions that ''M. pinnata'' could be grown all the way across the continent as a way to prevent the encroachment of the [[Sahara]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.riverreporter.com/issues/07-01-18/head1-biodiesel.html |title=Biodiesel in Africa |publisher=Riverreporter.com |date=2006-01-18 |accessdate=2013-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[University of Queensland]] node of the Australian Research Council Center for Excellence in Legume Research, under the directorship of Professor Peter Gresshoff, in conjunction with [[Pacific Renewable Energy]] are currently working on ''M. pinnata'' for commercial use for the production of biofuel. Projects are currently focused on understanding aspects of ''M. pinnata'' including root biology, nodulation, nitrogen fixation, domestication genes, grafting, salinity tolerance, and the genetics of the oil production pathways. Emphasis is given to analyzing [[carbon sequestration]] (in relation to carbon credits) and nitrogen gain.

Research has also been put into using the material left over from the oil extraction as a feed supplement for cattle, sheep and poultry as this byproduct contains up to 30% protein. Other studies have shown some potential for [[biocide|biocidal]] activity against ''[[Vibrio cholerae|V. cholerae]]'' and ''[[Escherichia coli|E. coli]]'', as well an anti-inflammatory, antinociceptive (reduction in sensitivity to painful stimuli) and antipyretic (reduction in fever) properties. There is also research indicating that ''M. pinnata'' can be used as a natural [[insecticide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1007/s12155-008-9003-0|title=Pongamia pinnata: An Untapped Resource for the Biofuels Industry of the Future|year=2008|last1=Scott|first1=Paul T.|last2=Pregelj|first2=Lisette|last3=Chen|first3=Ning|last4=Hadler|first4=Johanna S.|last5=Djordjevic|first5=Michael A.|last6=Gresshoff|first6=Peter M.|journal=BioEnergy Research|volume=1|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1430">'''Molten salt oxidation''' is a non-flame, [[thermal process]] that destroys all organic materials while simultaneously retaining inorganic and [[hazardous material|hazardous components]] in the melt. It is used as either hazardous [[waste treatment]](with air) or [[energy harvesting]] similar to coal and wood [[gasification]](with steam).
The molten salt of choice has been [[sodium carbonate]] (m.p 851°C), but other salts can be used. Sulfur, halogens, phosphorus and similar volatile pollutants are oxidized and retained in the melt. Most organic carbon content leaves as relatively pure CO/{{CO2}}/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;/H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O gas (depending on the feed conditions, whether steam or air is used), and the effluent only requires a cold trap and a mild aqueous wash (except [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]-containing wastes). It has been used for safe [[biological weapon|biological]] and [[chemical weapon]]s destruction, and processing waste such as [[scrap tires]] where direct incineration/effluent treatment is difficult.
The major downside of the process compared to direct incineration is the eventual saturation of the melt by contaminants, and needing reprocessing/replacement.

'''Nuclear reactor physics''' is the branch of science that deals with the study and application of chain reaction to induce a controlled rate of fission in a nuclear reactor for the production of energy.&lt;ref name=NuclearRxPhysics&gt;van Dam, H., van der Hagen, T. H. J. J., &amp; Hoogenboom, J. E. (2005). ''Nuclear reactor physics''. Retrieved from http://www.janleenkloosterman.nl/reports/ap3341.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;
Most [[nuclear reactor]]s use a [[chain reaction]] to induce a controlled rate of [[nuclear fission]] in fissile material, releasing both [[nuclear power|energy]] and free [[neutron]]s.  A reactor consists of an assembly of nuclear fuel (a [[Nuclear reactor core|reactor core]]), usually surrounded by a [[neutron moderator]] such as [[water|regular water]], [[heavy water]], [[graphite]], or [[zirconium hydride]], and fitted with mechanisms such as [[control rods]] that control the rate of the reaction.  

The physics of [[nuclear fission]] has several quirks that affect the design and behavior of nuclear reactors. This article presents a general overview of the physics of nuclear reactors and their behavior.

==Criticality==

In a nuclear reactor, the [[neutron]] population at any instant is a function of the rate of neutron production (due to fission processes) and the rate of neutron losses (due to non-fission absorption mechanisms and leakage from the system). When a reactor’s neutron population remains steady from one generation to the next (creating as many new neutrons as are lost), the fission chain reaction is self-sustaining and the reactor's condition is referred to as "critical". When the reactor’s neutron production exceeds losses, characterized by increasing power level, it is considered "supercritical", and when losses dominate, it is considered "subcritical" and exhibits decreasing power.

The "[[Six factor formula|Six-factor formula]]" is the neutron life-cycle balance equation, which includes six separate factors, the product of which is equal to the ratio of the number of neutrons in any generation to that of the previous one; this parameter is called the effective multiplication factor k, also denoted by K&lt;sub&gt;eff&lt;/sub&gt;, where  k =  Є ''L''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; ρ ''L''&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; ''f'' η, where Є = "fast-fission factor", ''L''&lt;sub&gt;f&lt;/sub&gt; = "fast non-leakage factor", ρ = "resonance escape probability", ''L''&lt;sub&gt;th&lt;/sub&gt; = "thermal non-leakage factor", ''f'' = "thermal fuel utilization factor", and η = "reproduction factor". This equation's factors are roughly in order of potential occurrence for a fission born neutron during critical operation. As already mentioned before,  k = (Neutrons produced in one generation)/(Neutrons produced in the previous generation). In other words, when the reactor is critical, k = 1; when the reactor is subcritical, k &lt; 1; and when the reactor is supercritical, k &gt; 1.  

''[[Nuclear chain reaction|Reactivity]]'' is an expression of the departure from criticality.  δk = (k − 1)/k.  When the reactor is critical, δk = 0.  When the reactor is subcritical, δk &lt; 0.  When the reactor is supercritical, δk &gt; 0.  Reactivity is also represented by the lowercase Greek letter rho ('''ρ'''). Reactivity is commonly expressed in decimals or percentages or pcm (per cent mille) of Δk/k. When reactivity ρ is expressed in units of delayed neutron fraction β, the unit is called the ''[[Louis Slotin#Dollar unit of reactivity|dollar]]''.

If we write 'N' for the number of free neutrons in a reactor core and &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; for the average lifetime of each neutron (before it either escapes from the core or is absorbed by a nucleus), then the reactor will follow the [[differential equation]] (''evolution equation'')

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dt} = \frac{\alpha N}{\tau}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is a constant of proportionality, and &lt;math&gt;dN/dt&lt;/math&gt; is the rate of change of the neutron count in the core.  This type of differential equation describes [[exponential growth]] or [[exponential decay]], depending on the sign of the constant &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;, which is just the expected number of neutrons after one average neutron lifetime has elapsed:

:&lt;math&gt;\alpha = P_{impact}P_{fission} n_{avg} - P_{absorb} - P_{escape}&lt;/math&gt;

Here, &lt;math&gt;P_{impact}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that a particular neutron will strike a fuel nucleus, &lt;math&gt;P_{fission}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that the neutron, having struck the fuel, will cause that nucleus to undergo fission, &lt;math&gt;P_{absorb}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that it will be absorbed by something other than fuel, and &lt;math&gt;P_{escape}&lt;/math&gt; is the probability that it will "escape" by leaving the core altogether.  &lt;math&gt;n_{avg}&lt;/math&gt; is the number of neutrons produced, on average, by a fission event—it is between 2 and 3 for both &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U and &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu.

If &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is positive, then the core is ''supercritical'' and the rate of neutron production will grow exponentially until some other effect stops the growth.  If &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is negative, then the core is "subcritical" and the number of free neutrons in the core will shrink exponentially until it reaches an equilibrium at zero (or the background level from spontaneous fission).  If &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is exactly zero, then the reactor is ''critical'' and its output does not vary in time (&lt;math&gt;dN/dt = 0&lt;/math&gt;, from above). 

Nuclear reactors are engineered to reduce &lt;math&gt;P_{escape}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;P_{absorb}&lt;/math&gt;.  Small, compact structures reduce the probability of direct escape by minimizing the [[surface area]] of the core, and some materials (such as [[graphite]]) can [[Reflection (physics)|reflect]] some neutrons back into the core, further reducing &lt;math&gt;P_{escape}&lt;/math&gt;.  

The probability of fission, &lt;math&gt;P_{fission}&lt;/math&gt;, depends on the nuclear physics of the fuel, and is often expressed as a [[cross section (physics)|cross section]].  Reactors are usually controlled by adjusting &lt;math&gt;P_{absorb}&lt;/math&gt;.  [[Control rods]] made of a strongly neutron-absorbent material such as [[cadmium]] or [[boron]] can be inserted into the core: any neutron that happens to impact the control rod is lost from the chain reaction, reducing &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt;.  &lt;math&gt;P_{absorb}&lt;/math&gt; is also controlled by the recent history of the reactor core itself (see below).

===Starter sources===
{{main|Startup neutron source}}{{See also|Zero power critical}}
The mere fact that an assembly is supercritical does not guarantee that it contains any free neutrons at all.  At least one neutron is required to "strike" a chain reaction, and if the [[spontaneous fission]] rate is sufficiently low it may take a long time (in &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U reactors, as long as many minutes) before a chance neutron encounter starts a chain reaction even if the reactor is supercritical.  Most nuclear reactors include a "starter" [[neutron source]] that ensures there are always a few free neutrons in the reactor core, so that a chain reaction will begin immediately when the core is made critical.  A common type of [[startup neutron source]] is a mixture of an [[alpha particle]] emitter such as &lt;sup&gt;241&lt;/sup&gt;Am ([[americium-241]]) with a lightweight isotope such as &lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt;Be ([[beryllium-9]]).

The primary sources described above have to be used with fresh reactor cores. For operational reactors, secondary sources are used; most often a combination of [[antimony]] with [[beryllium]]. Antimony becomes [[neutron activation|activated]] in the reactor and produces high-energy [[gamma photon]]s, which produce [[photoneutron]]s from beryllium.

[[Uranium-235]] undergoes a small rate of natural spontaneous fission, so there are always some neutrons being produced even in a fully shutdown reactor. When the [[control rod]]s are withdrawn and criticality is approached the number increases because the absorption of neutrons is being progressively reduced, until at criticality the chain reaction becomes self-sustaining. Note that while a neutron source is provided in the reactor, this is not essential to start the chain reaction, its main purpose is to give a shutdown neutron population which is detectable by instruments and so make the approach to critical more observable. The reactor will go critical at the same control rod position whether a source is loaded or not.

Once the chain reaction is begun, the primary starter source may be removed from the core to prevent damage from the high [[neutron flux]] in the operating reactor core; the secondary sources usually remains in situ to provide a background reference level for control of criticality.

==Subcritical multiplication==

Even in a subcritical assembly such as a shut-down reactor core, any stray neutron that happens to be present in the core (for example from spontaneous fission of the fuel, from radioactive decay of fission products, or from a [[neutron source]]) will trigger an exponentially decaying chain reaction.  Although the chain reaction is not self-sustaining, it acts as a multiplier that increases the [[secular equilibrium|equilibrium]] number of neutrons in the core.  This ''subcritical multiplication'' effect can be used in two ways:  as a probe of how close a core is to criticality, and as a way to generate fission power without the risks associated with a critical mass. 

If &lt;math&gt;k&lt;/math&gt; is the neutron multiplication factor of a subcritical core and &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt; is the number of neutrons coming per generation in the reactor from an external source, then at the instant when the neutron source is switched on, number of neutrons in the core will be &lt;math&gt;S_0&lt;/math&gt;. After 1 generation, this neutrons will produce &lt;math&gt;k \times S_0 &lt;/math&gt; neutrons in the reactor and reactor will have a totality of &lt;math&gt; k \times S_0 + S_0 &lt;/math&gt; neutrons considering the newly entered neutrons in the reactor. Similarly after 2 generation, number of neutrons produced in the reactor will be &lt;math&gt; k \times (k \times S_0 + S_0) + S_0 &lt;/math&gt; and so on. This process will continue and after a long enough time, the number of neutrons in the reactor will be,

:&lt;math&gt; S_0 +k \times S_0 + k \times k \times S_0 + \ldots &lt;/math&gt;

This series will converge because for the subcritical core, &lt;math&gt; 0 &lt; k &lt; 1 &lt;/math&gt;. So the number of neutrons in the reactor will be simply,

:&lt;math&gt; \frac{S_0}{1-k} &lt;/math&gt;

The fraction &lt;math&gt;\frac{1}{1-k}&lt;/math&gt; is called subcritical multiplication factor.

Since power in a reactor is proportional to the number of neutrons present in the nuclear fuel material (material in which fission can occur), the power produced by such a subcritical core will also be proportional to the subcritical multiplication factor and the external source strength.

As a measurement technique, subcritical multiplication was used during the [[Manhattan Project]] in early experiments to determine the minimum critical masses of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U and of &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu.  It is still used today to calibrate the controls for nuclear reactors during startup, as many effects (discussed in the following sections) can change the required control settings to achieve criticality in a reactor.  As a power-generating technique, subcritical multiplication allows generation of nuclear power for fission where a critical assembly is undesirable for safety or other reasons.  A subcritical assembly together with a neutron source can serve as a steady source of heat to generate power from fission.  

Including the effect of an external neutron source ("external" to the fission process, not physically external to the core), one can write a modified evolution equation:

:&lt;math&gt;\frac{dN}{dt} = \frac{\alpha N}{\tau} + R_{ext}&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;R_{ext}&lt;/math&gt; is the rate at which the external source injects neutrons into the core.  In [[secular equilibrium|equilibrium]], the core is not changing and dN/dt is zero, so the equilibrium number of neutrons is given by:

:&lt;math&gt;N = -\frac{\tau R_{ext}}{\alpha}&lt;/math&gt;

If the core is subcritical, then &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is negative so there is an equilibrium with a positive number of neutrons.  If the core is close to criticality, then &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is very small and thus the final number of neutrons can be made arbitrarily large.

==Neutron moderators==

To improve &lt;math&gt;P_{fission}&lt;/math&gt; and enable a chain reaction, uranium-fueled reactors must include a [[neutron moderator]] that interacts with newly produced [[fast neutrons]] from fission events to reduce their kinetic energy from several [[MeV]] to thermal energies of less than one [[Electronvolt|eV]], making them more likely to induce fission.  This is because &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U is much more likely to undergo fission when struck by one of these [[thermal neutron]]s than by a freshly produced neutron from fission.

Neutron moderators are thus materials that slow down neutrons.  Neutrons are most effectively slowed by colliding with the nucleus of a light atom, hydrogen being the lightest of all.  To be effective, moderator materials must thus contain light elements with atomic nuclei that tend to scatter neutrons on impact rather than absorb them.  In addition to hydrogen, beryllium and carbon atoms are also suited to the job of moderating or slowing down neutrons.

Hydrogen moderators include [[water]] (H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), [[heavy water]]([[deuterium|D]]&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and [[zirconium hydride]] (ZrH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;), all of which work because a hydrogen nucleus has nearly the same mass as a free neutron: neutron-H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O or neutron-ZrH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; impacts excite [[rotational mode]]s of the molecules (spinning them around).  [[Deuterium]] nuclei (in heavy water) absorb kinetic energy less well than do light hydrogen nuclei, but they are much less likely to absorb the impacting neutron.  Water or heavy water have the advantage of being [[Transparency (optics)|transparent]] [[liquid]]s, so that, in addition to shielding and moderating a reactor core, they permit direct viewing of the core in operation and can also serve as a working fluid for heat transfer. 

Carbon in the form of graphite has been widely used as a moderator.  It was used in [[Chicago Pile-1]], the world's first man-made critical assembly, and was commonplace in early reactor designs including the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[RBMK]] [[nuclear power plant]]s such as the [[Chernobyl accident|Chernobyl plant]].

===Moderators and reactor design===

The amount and nature of neutron moderation affects reactor controllability and hence safety.  Because moderators both slow and absorb neutrons, there is an optimum amount of moderator to include in a given geometry of reactor core.   Less moderation reduces the effectiveness by reducing the &lt;math&gt;P_{fission}&lt;/math&gt; term in the evolution equation, and more moderation reduces the effectiveness by increasing the &lt;math&gt;P_{escape}&lt;/math&gt; term.  

Most moderators become less effective with increasing temperature, so ''under-moderated'' reactors are stable against changes in temperature in the reactor core:  if the core overheats, then the quality of the moderator is reduced and the reaction tends to slow down (there is a "negative temperature coefficient" in the reactivity of the core).  Water is an extreme case:  in extreme heat, it can boil, producing [[void coefficient|effective void]]s in the reactor core without destroying the physical structure of the core; this tends to shut down the reaction and reduce the possibility of a fuel [[Nuclear meltdown|meltdown]].  ''Over-moderated'' reactors are unstable against changes in temperature (there is a "positive temperature coefficient" in the reactivity of the core), and so are less inherently safe than under-moderated cores.

Some reactors use a combination of [[neutron moderator|moderator]] materials.  For example, [[TRIGA]] type research reactors use ZrH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; moderator mixed with the &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U fuel, an H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O-filled core, and C (graphite) moderator and [[neutron reflector|reflector]] blocks around the periphery of the core.

==Delayed neutrons and controllability==
{{main|Delayed neutron}}
Fission reactions and subsequent neutron escape happen very quickly; this is important for [[nuclear weapons]], where the objective is to make a nuclear core release as much energy as possible before it physically [[explosion|explodes]].  Most neutrons emitted by fission events are [[prompt neutron|prompt]]: they are emitted effectively instantaneously.   Once emitted, the average neutron lifetime (&lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt;) in a typical core is on the order of a  [[millisecond]], so if the exponential factor &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; is as small as 0.01, then in one second the reactor power will vary by a factor of (1 + 0.01)&lt;sup&gt;1000&lt;/sup&gt;, or more than ten [[thousand]].  Nuclear weapons are engineered to maximize the power growth rate, with lifetimes well under a millisecond and exponential factors close to 2; but such rapid variation would render it practically impossible to control the reaction rates in a nuclear reactor.

Fortunately, the ''effective'' neutron lifetime is much longer than the average lifetime of a single neutron in the core.  About 0.65% of the neutrons produced by &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U fission, and about 0.20% of the neutrons produced by &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu fission, are not produced immediately, but rather are emitted from an excited nucleus after a further decay step. In this step, further [[radioactive decay]] of some of the fission products (almost always negative [[beta decay]]), is followed by immediate neutron emission from the excited daughter product, with an average life time of the beta decay (and thus the neutron emission) of about 15 seconds. These so-called [[delayed neutron]]s increase the effective average lifetime of neutrons in the core, to nearly 0.1 seconds, so that a core with &lt;math&gt;\alpha&lt;/math&gt; of 0.01 would increase in one second by only a factor of (1 + 0.01)&lt;sup&gt;10&lt;/sup&gt;, or about 1.1: a 10% increase. This is a controllable rate of change.

Most nuclear reactors are hence operated in a ''prompt subcritical'', ''delayed critical'' condition: the prompt neutrons alone are not sufficient to sustain a chain reaction, but the delayed neutrons make up the small difference required to keep the reaction going. This has effects on how reactors are controlled:  when a small amount of control rod is slid into or out of the reactor core, the power level changes at first very rapidly due to ''prompt subcritical multiplication'' and then more gradually, following the exponential growth or decay curve of the delayed critical reaction. Furthermore, ''increases'' in reactor power can be performed at any desired rate simply by pulling out a sufficient length of control rod. However, without addition of a [[neutron poison]] or active neutron-absorber, ''decreases'' in fission rate are limited in speed, because even if the reactor is taken deeply subcritical to stop prompt fission neutron production, delayed neutrons are produced after ordinary beta decay of fission products already in place, and this decay-production of neutrons cannot be changed.

==Kinetics==
The kinetics of the reactor is described by the balance equations of neutrons and nuclei (fissile, fission products).

==Reactor poisons==
{{main|Nuclear poison}}
Any element that strongly absorbs neutrons is called a [[Nuclear poison|reactor poison]], because it tends to shut down (poison) an ongoing fission chain reaction.  Some reactor poisons are deliberately inserted into fission reactor cores to control the reaction; [[boron]] or [[cadmium]] control rods are the best example.  Many reactor poisons are produced by the fission process itself, and buildup of neutron-absorbing fission products affects both the fuel economics and the controllability of nuclear reactors.

===Long-lived poisons and fuel reprocessing===

In practice, buildup of reactor poisons in nuclear fuel is what determines the lifetime of nuclear fuel in a reactor:  long before all possible fissions have taken place, buildup of long-lived neutron absorbing fission products damps out the chain reaction.  This is the reason that [[nuclear reprocessing]] is a useful activity:  spent nuclear fuel contains about 96% of the original fissionable material present in newly manufactured nuclear fuel.  Chemical separation of the fission products restores the nuclear fuel so that it can be used again.  

Nuclear reprocessing is useful economically because chemical separation is much simpler to accomplish than the difficult [[isotope separation]] required to prepare nuclear fuel from natural uranium ore, so that in principle chemical separation yields more generated energy for less effort than mining, purifying, and isotopically separating new uranium ore.  In practice, both the difficulty of handling the highly radioactive fission products and other political concerns make fuel reprocessing a contentious subject. One such concern is the fact that spent uranium nuclear fuel contains significant quantities of &lt;sup&gt;239&lt;/sup&gt;Pu, a prime ingredient in nuclear weapons (see [[breeder reactor]]).

===Short-lived poisons and controllability===
{{main|Iodine pit}}
Short-lived reactor poisons in fission products strongly affect how nuclear reactors can operate.  Unstable fission product nuclei transmute into many different elements (''secondary fission products'') as they undergo a [[decay chain]] to a stable isotope.  The most important such element is [[xenon]], because the isotope [[Xe-135|&lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe]], a secondary fission product with a half-life of about 9 hours, is an extremely strong neutron absorber.   In an operating reactor, each nucleus of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe becomes &lt;sup&gt;136&lt;/sup&gt;Xe (which may later sustain beta decay) by [[neutron capture]] almost as soon as it is created, so that there is no buildup in the core.  However, when a reactor shuts down, the level of &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe builds up in the core for about 9 hours before beginning to decay. The result is that, about 6–8 hours after a reactor is shut down, it can become physically impossible to restart the chain reaction until the &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe has had a chance to decay over the next several hours. This temporary state, which may last several days and prevent restart, is called the [[iodine pit]] or xenon-poisoning. It is one reason why nuclear power reactors are usually operated at an even power level around the clock.

&lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe buildup in a reactor core makes it extremely dangerous to operate the reactor a few hours after it has been shut down.  Because the &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe absorbs neutrons strongly, starting a reactor in a high-Xe condition requires pulling the control rods out of the core much farther than normal. However, if the reactor does achieve criticality, then the neutron flux in the core becomes high and &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe is destroyed rapidly—this has the same effect as very rapidly removing a great length of control rod from the core, and can cause the reaction to grow too rapidly or even become [[prompt critical]].

&lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe played a large part in the [[Chernobyl accident]]: about eight hours after a scheduled maintenance shutdown, workers tried to bring the reactor to a [[zero power critical]] condition to test a control circuit. Since the core was loaded with &lt;sup&gt;135&lt;/sup&gt;Xe from the previous day's power generation, it was necessary to withdraw more control rods to achieve this. As a result, the overdriven reaction grew rapidly and uncontrollably, leading to steam explosion in the core, and violent destruction of the facility.

==Uranium enrichment==

While many [[fissionable]] isotopes exist in nature, the only usefully [[fissile]] isotope found in any quantity is [[uranium|&lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U]]. About 0.7% of the uranium in most ores is the 235 isotope, and about 99.3% is the non-fissile 238 isotope.  For most uses as a nuclear fuel, uranium must be ''enriched'' - purified so that it contains a higher percentage of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U. Because &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U absorbs fast neutrons, the [[critical mass]] needed to sustain a chain reaction increases as the &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U content increases, reaching infinity at 94% &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U (6% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U).&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fissilematerials.org/ipfm/pages_us_en/fissile/fissile/fissile.php&lt;/ref&gt;
Concentrations lower than 6% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U cannot go fast critical, though they are usable in a nuclear reactor with a [[neutron moderator]].
A nuclear weapon primary stage using uranium uses [[Enriched uranium|HEU]] enriched to ~90% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U, though the secondary stage often uses lower enrichments. Nuclear reactors with water moderator require at least some enrichment of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U. Nuclear reactors with [[heavy water]] moderation can operate with natural uranium, eliminating altogether the need for enrichment and preventing the fuel from being useful for nuclear weapons; the [[CANDU reactor|CANDU]] power reactors used in [[Canada|Canadian]] power plants are an example of this type. 

[[Uranium enrichment]] is difficult because the chemical properties of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U and &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U are identical, so physical processes such as [[gaseous diffusion]], [[gas centrifuge]] or [[mass spectrometer|mass spectrometry]] must be used for [[isotopic separation]] based on small differences in mass.  Because enrichment is the main technical hurdle to production of nuclear fuel and simple nuclear weapons, enrichment technology is politically sensitive.

==Oklo: a natural nuclear reactor==
{{main|Natural nuclear fission reactor}}
Modern deposits of uranium contain only up to ~0.7% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U (and ~99.3% &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U), which is not enough to sustain a chain reaction moderated by ordinary water.  But &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U has a much shorter [[half-life]] (700 million years) than &lt;sup&gt;238&lt;/sup&gt;U (4.5 billion years), so in the distant past the percentage of &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U was much higher.  About two billion years ago, a water-saturated uranium deposit (in what is now the [[Oklo]] mine in [[Gabon]], [[West Africa]]) underwent a naturally occurring chain reaction that was moderated by [[groundwater]] and, presumably, controlled by the negative void coefficient as the water boiled from the heat of the reaction.  Uranium from the Oklo mine is about 50% depleted compared to other locations: it is only about 0.3% to 0.7% &lt;sup&gt;235&lt;/sup&gt;U; and the ore contains traces of stable daughters of long-decayed fission products.

A '''paper-ruling machine''' is a device developed by William Orville Hickok in the second half of the [[19th century]] for ruling [[paper]].&lt;ref name="hickok"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hickokmfg.com/history.htm|title=Company history|date=2016-09-24|publisher=The W.O.

The functionality of the machine is based on pens manufactured especially for the device. The pens have multiple tips side by side, and water-based ink is led into them along threads. It is possible to program stop-lines on the equipment by mounting pens on shafts equipped with cams that lower and raise them at predetermined points.&lt;ref name="americanbookbindersmuseum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://bookbindersmuseum.org/the-pen-ruling-machine/|title=The Pen Ruler|date=2016-09-24|publisher=American Bookbinders Museum}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The spread of computerized accounting between the 1960s and 1980s significantly decreased the demand for accounting tables and ruled paper. Nowadays, their demand is primarily filled by using [[offset printing]].&lt;ref name="americanbookbindersmuseum"/&gt;

A '''patio heater''' (also called a mushroom or umbrella heater) is a [[radiant heating]] appliance for generating [[thermal radiation]] for outdoor use.

A burner on top of a pole, it burns [[liquefied petroleum gas]] (LPG), [[propane]] or [[butane]], and directs the flames against a perforated metal screen. Heat is radiated from the surface of the screen in a circular pattern around the appliance. A reflector a top the burner reflects heat that would be otherwise lost upwards. This is because the reflecting hood is usually silvered which makes it a poor absorber of heat but excellent at reflecting infra-red radiation back. This reduces the amount of heat lost by conduction as silvered surfaces will not absorb infra-red light. The [[chimenea]] is an alternative to the patio heater for home use, which burns wood instead of gas.

Some newer types of patio heaters are [[Electric heating#Radiative heaters|electrically powered radiative heaters]] that emit infrared energy onto nearby surfaces, which in turn heat up the surrounding air.

Other styles of outdoor patio heaters include:
* Wall Mounted Patio Heater: fixed to a wall or structure making for safe operation
* Hanging Patio Heater: portable and small foot print which comes in electric only
* Tabletop Patio Heater: ultra portable and great for smaller groups or outdoor dining, but uses a small propane tank

Patio heaters have become popular with bars and restaurants since they extend the day and the season for their customers to sit outdoors. This increase in the popularity of the patio heater has led to concerns over their environmental effects. One patio heater can produce four tons of carbon dioxide annually.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=YZRf_BOUj8EC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=patio+heaters+wasteful&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=OpIdUsblDNew4AOvyYDgCQ&amp;ved=0CFEQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=patio%20heaters%20wasteful&amp;f=false | title=Get an Ethical Life: Flash | publisher=Hachette UK | date=Jun 24, 2011 | accessdate=28 August 2013 | author=Macbride, Peter | pages=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Fuel types ==

=== Propane fuel ===

Propane patio heaters are the most popular type as they are portable and easy to find refill locations such as gas stations or convenience stores. The downside to propane is that you need to purchase a separate tank for each heater you own and can be more costly to operate than electric or natural gas.

=== Natural gas fuel ===

Natural gas patio heaters are great as more and more houses come outfitted with natural gas lines. This makes it very convenient to hook into, however it is less portable than propane. Extension hoses are available, but can be a tripping hazard especially after the sun has gone down.

=== Electric ===

Electric patio heaters are a great choice for easy setup, and has indoor applications as well, for partially enclosed indoor-outdoor space. Electric heaters are typically generally a bit weaker, therefore it’s best for a small group of people.

'''Plus System, Inc.''' (also known as '''Visa Plus''' or simply '''Plus''') is a [[Denver]]-based [[Interbank network|ATM network]] that provides cash to [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] cardholders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/snapshot.asp?privcapId=13653375 |title=Company Overview of Plus System, Inc. |publisher=[[Bloomberg L.P.]] |date=January 27, 2018 |access-date=January 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a subsidiary of Visa Inc., Plus System connects all Visa [[Credit card|credit]], [[Debit card|debit]] and [[prepaid debit card|prepaid cards]], as well as [[Automated teller machine|ATM]] cards issued by various banks worldwide bearing the Visa logo.

Plus System started out as a consortium formed by 34 major U.S. banks to build a national network of [[automated teller machine]]s (ATM). It initially was composed of 2,000 ATMs linking 1,000 banks and their customers in 47 states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|journal=Computerworld|publication-date=August 1, 1983|page=12|last=Bartolik|first=Peter|title=Consortium Launches National Net Of ATMs}}&lt;/ref&gt;
As the booming ATM industry outgrew regional networks and began to go nationwide in the mid-1980s, [[credit-card]] giant Visa sought entry in the lucrative ATM network business and acquired a third of Plus System in 1987. Currently, there are over one million Plus-linked ATMs in 170 countries worldwide.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018|reason=Original citation given is dead and was probably an ATM locator without any numbers of total numbers of Plus-linked ATMs world wide}}

Plus cards can be linked in the following ways: as a standalone network, linked with a local interbank network or linked with any Visa product displaying the Visa flag on the front (Visa, Visa Debit and [[Visa Electron]]). Currently, there are 144 million proprietary Plus cards, not including a number of cards which have Plus as a secondary network.

Plus is widely used as a local interbank network most common in the [[United States]] where networks such as [[STAR (interbank network)|STAR]], [[NYCE]] and [[Pulse (interbank network)|Pulse]] also compete. It is also used in [[Canada]], though it is significantly smaller than [[Interac]] there, and in places such as [[India]] and [[Indonesia]] where there are many interbank networks.  The main competitor of Plus System is the [[Cirrus (interbank network)|Cirrus]] network, which is owned by Visa longtime rival [[MasterCard]].

'''Potassium picrate''', or '''potassium 2,4,6-trinitrophenolate''', is an organic chemical, a [[picrate]] of [[potassium]]. It is a reddish yellow or green crystalline material. It is a [[primary explosive]]. Anhydrous potassium picrate forms [[orthorhombic]] crystals.

== History ==
Potassium picrate was first prepared as impure in mid-17th century by [[Johann Rudolf Glauber]] by dissolving [[wood]] in [[nitric acid]] and neutralizing with [[potassium carbonate]]. It is commonly made by neutralizing [[picric acid]] by potassium carbonate. It was used since 1869. Its chief applications are in [[pyrotechnics]], in some [[whistle mix]]es, as a component of [[explosive]]s (with [[potassium nitrate]] and [[charcoal]]), [[propellant]]s (with [[potassium chlorate]]), and [[explosive primer]]s (with [[lead picrate]] and [[potassium chlorate]]). 

== Description ==
Potassium picrate is not a very powerful explosive. It is somewhat shock-sensitive. In contact with flame it [[deflagration|deflagrates]] with a loud sound. If ignited in confined space, it will [[detonate]]. It is more sensitive than [[picric acid]]. &lt;!-- Encyclopedia of explosives and related items, vol. 8, 1978 --&gt;

In contact with metals (e.g. lead, calcium, iron), potassium picrate, like [[ammonium picrate]] and [[picric acid]], forms picrates of said metals. These are often more dangerous and more sensitive explosives. Contact with such materials therefore should be prevented.

Potassium picrate is used to determine the concentration of nonionic [[surfactant]]s in water; materials detectable by this method are called '''potassium picrate active substances''' ('''PPAS''').

== Synthesis ==
As with other picrates, potassium picrate may be produced by the neutralization of picric acid with the corresponding carbonate.
As picric acid is barely soluble in water the reaction must be done in an appropriate solvent like methanol.
First dissolving the picric acid in methanol and then adding potassium carbonate will result in potassium picrate. Temperature control is important to prevent detonation or excessive methanol evaporation.

== Sensitivity ==
According to Urbanski, Potassium picrate detonated 10% of the time when struck by a mass of 2kg dropped from the height of 21cm.
By comparison, the more sensitive anhydrous lead picrate detonated 10% of the time when struck by the same mass dropped from the height of 2cm.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2922">'''RTTOV''' - the fast [[atmospheric radiative transfer codes|radiative transfer]] model for calculations of radiances for satellite infrared or microwave nadir scanning radiometers (see [[push broom scanner]]).

Given an atmospheric profile of temperature, variable gas concentrations, cloud and surface properties RTTOV calculates [[radiance]]s and [[brightness temperature]]s. The only mandatory input is water vapour. Optionally [[ozone]], [[carbon dioxide]], [[nitrous oxide]], [[methane]] and [[carbon monoxide]] can be variable with all other constituents assumed
to be constant.  The range of temperatures and water vapour concentrations over which the optical
depth computations are valid depends on the training datasets which were used.  The spectral range of the RTTOV9.1 model is 3-20 [[micrometres]] (500 – 3000&amp;nbsp;cm-1) in the infrared.

RTTOV  contains [[forward radiative transfer model|forward]], [[tangent linear radiative transfer model|tangent linear]], [[adjoint radiative transfer model|adjoint]] and K (full Jacobian matrices) versions of the model; the latter three modules for variational
assimilation or retrieval applications.

One of several applications of RTTOV are retrievals of brightness temperature and [[sea surface temperature]] from [[Advanced Very High Resolution Radiometer]] sensor.

==  FASTEM ==
Surface emissivity model which parameterizes surface emissivity. FASTEM2 computes the surface emissivity averaged over all facets representing the surface of the ocean and an effective path correction factor for the down-welling brightness temperature. FASTEM2 is applicable for frequencies between 10 and 220&amp;nbsp;GHz, for earth incidence angles less than 60 degrees.

'''RW3 Technologies''' is a software company that provides [[SaaS]] field sales, survey, and reporting applications for the [[consumer packaged goods]] (CPG) industry.  It is headquartered in the Bay Area of California.

== History ==
RW3 Technologies was founded in the Bay Area by Bruce Nagle in 1992.  &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Dvorak|first1=Phred|title=Do-It-Yourself Consulting: CEOs Gather to Swap Tips|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB118541288405378455|accessdate=9 July 2015|publisher=The Wall Street Journal|date=26 July 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; The company's primary focus was to streamline daily data entry processes for the sales industry.

In 1992, RW3 introduced one of the first Land-Line CPG broker sales systems that allowed for mobile data entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Borrego|first1=Annie Marie|title=Start-up Springboards|url=http://www.inc.com/magazine/20001015/20778.html|website=Inc.|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was initially used in food brokerage, though eventually expanded to include functionality for the [[Consumer Packaged Goods|consumer packaged goods]] industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Costello|first1=Daniel|title=Curing An Open Wound|url=http://www.destinationcrm.com/Articles/Older-Articles/The-Edge/Curing-An-Open-Wound-48561.aspx|website=Destination CRM|publisher=CRM Magazine|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000, the company expanded its [[business model]] to include [[B2B e-commerce|business-to-business]] account management.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ackerman|first1=Alliston|title=National Tobacco Company Undergoes Sales Force Evolution|url=http://consumergoods.edgl.com/news/National-Tobacco-Company-Undergoes-Sales-Force-Evolution79917/|accessdate=24 July 2015|agency=Consumer Goods Technology}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 2010, the company began development of their first general [[SaaS]] product application since the late 1990s; the SaaS application called InStore Mobile (now MarketCheck) was released in 2011. The in-store survey application allows for two-way communication between the account rep and broker, allowing organizations to improve and track retail conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=SMB Standout's - King's Hawaiian|url=http://www.consumergoods-digital.com/consumergoodstechnology/april_2015#pg7|accessdate=24 July 2015|agency=CGT|publisher=Edgell Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, RW3 released the BI Suite, a [[Business intelligence|business intelligence environment]] that enables rganizations to create views across departments and utilize multiple data sources to align sales strategies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Analytics Advantage|url=http://www.consumergoods-digital.com/consumergoodstechnology/november_2014#pg12|accessdate=24 July 2015|agency=Consumer Goods Technology|publisher=Edgell Communication}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014 Smartcall was launched and marketed to the CPG industry.  The application enables field sales reps to conduct traditional store calls and manage sales routes.  It is packaged with MarketCheck into their InStore Execution Suite, providing retail execution and monitoring applications for the consumer goods industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hagemeyer|first1=Dale|title=Market Guide for Retail Execution and Monitoring Solutions for the Consumer Goods Industry|url=https://www.gartner.com/doc/2998123/market-guide-retail-execution-monitoring|website=Gartner|accessdate=4 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Products ==
RW3 offers four SaaS products for the retail, wholesale, and B2B industries:

*'''MarketCheck''' - An application designed around the workflow of a field manager; enables users to access sales and analytics and other tools to help manage their brokers.

'''Satellite temperature measurements''' are [[Remote sensing#Data processing|inferences]]  of the [[temperature]] of the [[atmosphere]] at various altitudes as well as sea and land surface temperatures obtained from [[radiometric]] measurements by [[satellites]]. These measurements can be used to locate [[weather fronts]], monitor the [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation]], determine the strength of [[tropical cyclones]], study [[urban heat island]]s and monitor the global climate. [[Wildfires]], [[volcano]]s, and industrial hot spots can also be found via thermal imaging from weather satellites.

[[Weather satellite]]s do not measure temperature directly. They measure [[radiance]]s in various [[wavelength]] bands. Since 1978 [[microwave sounding unit]]s (MSUs) on [[National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration]] [[polar orbit]]ing satellites have measured the intensity of upwelling microwave radiation from atmospheric [[oxygen]], which is related to the temperature of broad vertical layers of the atmosphere. Measurements of [[infrared]] radiation pertaining to sea surface temperature have been collected since 1967.

Satellite datasets show that over the past four decades the [[troposphere]] has warmed and the [[stratosphere]] has cooled. Both of these trends are consistent with the influence of increasing atmospheric concentrations of [[greenhouse gases]].

==Measurements== 
[[Satellite]]s do not measure temperature. They measure radiances in various wavelength bands, which must then be mathematically inverted to obtain indirect inferences of temperature.&lt;ref name="NRC2000"&gt;{{cite book |chapter=Atmospheric Soundings |title=Issues in the Integration of Research and Operational Satellite Systems for Climate Research: Part I.

As a result, different groups that have analyzed the satellite data have produced differing temperature datasets. Among these are the [[UAH satellite temperature dataset|UAH dataset]] prepared at the [[University of Alabama in Huntsville]] and the RSS dataset prepared by [[Remote Sensing Systems]].

The satellite time series is not homogeneous. It is constructed from a series of satellites with similar but not identical sensors. The sensors also deteriorate over time, and corrections are necessary for orbital drift and decay.&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/JCLI-D-15-0744.1 Sensitivity of Satellite-Derived Tropospheric Temperature Trends to the Diurnal Cycle Adjustment] Journal of Climate May 3 2016&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://journals.ametsoc.org/doi/10.1175/2008JTECHA1176.1 Construction of the Remote Sensing Systems V3.2 Atmospheric Temperature Records from the MSU and AMSU Microwave Sounders] Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology July 2017&lt;/ref&gt; Particularly large differences between reconstructed temperature series occur at the few times when there is little temporal overlap between successive satellites, making intercalibration difficult.{{citation needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;ref&gt;[https://moyhu.blogspot.co.uk/2017/07/new-rss-tlt-v4-comparisons.html New RSS TLT V4 - comparisons] Moyhu July 4, 2017&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!-- this ref only says "One consequence is that with satellites there is a big problem with the inevitable changeovers" so not ideal but is better than nothing. hence leaving the CN tag in--&gt;

Satellites may also be used to retrieve surface temperatures in cloud-free conditions, generally via measurement of thermal infrared from [[AVHRR]].

===Tropospheric and stratospheric measurements===
{{See also|MSU temperature measurements}}
[[Image:Weighting Function.png|thumb|MSU weighting functions based upon the [[U.S. Standard Atmosphere]].]]
From 1979 to 2005 the [[microwave sounding unit]]s (MSUs) and since 1998 the [[Advanced Microwave Sounding Unit]]s on NOAA polar orbiting satellites have measured the intensity of upwelling [[microwave radiation]] from atmospheric [[oxygen]]. The intensity is proportional to the temperature of broad vertical layers of the [[atmosphere]], as demonstrated by theory and direct comparisons with atmospheric temperatures from radiosonde (balloon) profiles. Upwelling radiance is measured at different frequencies; these different frequency bands sample a different weighted range of the atmosphere.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssmi.com/msu/img/msu_weighting_functions.png Remote Sensing Systems] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130403061135/http://www.ssmi.com/msu/img/msu_weighting_functions.png |date=3 April 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The [[brightness temperature]] (T&lt;sub&gt;B&lt;/sub&gt;) measured by satellite is given by:&lt;ref name=Mears2009&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1175/2008JTECHA1176.1 |title=Construction of the Remote Sensing Systems V3.2 Atmospheric Temperature Records from the MSU and AMSU Microwave Sounders |journal=Journal of Atmospheric and Oceanic Technology |volume=26 |issue=6 |pages=1040–56 |year=2009 |last1=Mears |first1=Carl A. |last2=Wentz |first2=Frank J. |bibcode=2009JAtOT..26.1040M }}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;math&gt;T_B = W(0)T(0) + \int\limits_{0}^{TOA} W(z)T(z)\, dz &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;W(0)&lt;/math&gt; is the surface weight, &lt;math&gt;T(0)&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;T(z)&lt;/math&gt; are the temperatures at the surface and at the atmospheric level &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;W(z)&lt;/math&gt; is the atmospheric weighting function.

Both the surface and atmospheric weights are dependent on the surface emissivity &lt;math&gt;e_S&lt;/math&gt;, the absorption coefficient &lt;math&gt;\kappa(z)&lt;/math&gt; and the earth incidence angle &lt;math&gt;\theta&lt;/math&gt;; the surface weight is the product of &lt;math&gt;e_S&lt;/math&gt; and an attenuation factor:

&lt;math&gt; W(0) = e_Se^{-\tau (0, \infty) \sec\theta} &lt;/math&gt;

where

&lt;math&gt;\tau = \int\limits_{z1}^{z2} \kappa (z) dz &lt;/math&gt;

The atmospheric weighting functions &lt;math&gt;W(z)&lt;/math&gt; can be written as:

&lt;math&gt;W(z) = \kappa(z)\sec\theta e^{-\tau (z, \infty) \sec\theta} +  \kappa(z)\sec\theta e^{-\tau (0,z) \sec\theta}(1-e_S) e^{-\tau (0,\infty) \sec\theta}&lt;/math&gt;

The first term in this equation is related to the radiation emitted upward from the level &lt;math&gt;z&lt;/math&gt; and attenuated along the path to the top of the atmosphere (∞), the second include the radiation emitted downward from the level z to the surface (0) and the radiation reflected back by the surface (proportional to &lt;math&gt;e_S&lt;/math&gt;) to the top of the atmosphere, the exact form of &lt;math&gt;W(z)&lt;/math&gt; is dependent upon the temperature, water vapor and liquid water content of the atmosphere.

MSU Channel 1 is not used to monitor atmospheric temperature because it's too much sensitive to the emission from the surface, furthermore it is heavily contaminated by water vapor/liquid water in the lowermost troposphere.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Spencer|first=Roy|title=A TOVS Pathfinder Path C Product Daily 2.5 Degree Gridpoint Layer Temperatures and Oceanic Rainfall for 1979-93|url=http://iridl.ldeo.columbia.edu/SOURCES/.NASA/.msu/.dataset_documentation.html|accessdate=30 April 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Channel 2 or TMT is broadly representative of the [[troposphere]], albeit with a significant overlap with the lower stratosphere (the weighting function has its maximum at 350 hPa and half-power at about 40 and 800 hPa). In an attempt to remove the [[stratosphere|stratospheric]] influence, [[Roy Spencer (scientist)|Spencer]] and [[John Christy|Christy]] developed the synthetic "2LT or TLT" product by subtracting signals at different view angles; this has a maximum at about 650 hPa. However, this amplifies noise,&lt;ref name="Christy1998"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1175/1520-0442(1998)011&lt;2016:AOTMPF&gt;2.0.CO;2 |year=1998 |volume=11 |issue=8 |pages=2016–41 |title=Analysis of the Merging Procedure for the MSU Daily Temperature Time Series |journal=Journal of Climate |bibcode=1998JCli...11.2016. }}&lt;/ref&gt; increases inter-satellite calibration biases and enhances surface contamination.&lt;ref name="Fu2005"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/2004GL022266 |title=Satellite-derived vertical dependence of tropical tropospheric temperature trends |journal=Geophysical Research Letters |volume=32 |issue=10 |pages=L10703 |year=2005 |last1=Fu |first1=Qiang |last2=Johanson |first2=Celeste M. |bibcode=2005GeoRL..3210703F |citeseerx=10.1.1.211.3632 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The 2LT product has gone through numerous versions as various corrections have been applied.

Another methodology to reduce the influence of the stratosphere has been developed by Fu and Johanson,&lt;ref name="fu 2004"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1175/JCLI-3267.1 |title=Stratospheric Influences on MSU-Derived Tropospheric Temperature Trends: A Direct Error Analysis |journal=Journal of Climate |volume=17 |issue=24 |pages=4636–40 |year=2004 |last1=Fu |first1=Qiang |last2=Johanson |first2=Celeste M. |bibcode=2004JCli...17.4636F }}&lt;/ref&gt;  the TTT(Total Troposphere Temperature) channel is a linear combination of the TMT and TLS channel: TTT=1.156*TMT-0.153*TLS for the global average and TTT=1.12*TMT-0.11*TLS at tropical latitudes.

The T4 or TLS channel in representative of the temperature in the lower stratosphere with a peak weighting function at around 17&amp;nbsp;km above the earth surface.

Since 1979 the [[Stratospheric sounding unit]]s (SSUs) on the NOAA operational satellites provided near global stratospheric temperature data above the lower stratosphere.
The SSU is a far-infrared spectrometer employing a pressure modulation technique to make measurement in three channels in the 15 μm carbon dioxide absorption band. The three channels use the same frequency but different carbon dioxide cell pressure, the corresponding weighting functions peaks at 29&amp;nbsp;km for channel1, 37&amp;nbsp;km for channel2 and 45&amp;nbsp;km for channel3.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.ncdc.noaa.gov/oa/pod-guide/ncdc/docs/podug/html/c4/sec4-2.htm{{full citation needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Trends from the record==
{{See also|UAH satellite temperature dataset|MSU temperature measurements}}

Records have been created by merging data from nine different MSUs, each with peculiarities (e.g., time drift of the spacecraft relative to the local solar time) that must be calculated and removed because they can have substantial impacts on the resulting trend.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.usgcrp.gov/usgcrp/seminars/960521SM.html The Satellite Temperature Records: Parts 1 and 2] May 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

The process of constructing a temperature record from a radiance record is difficult. The satellite temperature record comes from a succession of different satellites and problems with inter-calibration between the satellites are important, especially NOAA-9, which accounts for most of the difference between various analyses.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ssmi.com/msu/msu_data_description.html Remote Sensing Systems] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20121123040542/http://www.ssmi.com/msu/msu_data_description.html |date=23 November 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; NOAA-11 played a significant role in a 2005 study by Mears ''et al.'' identifying an error in the diurnal correction that leads to the 40% jump in Spencer and Christy's trend from version 5.1 to 5.2.&lt;ref name="Mears2005"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1126/science.1114772 |pmid=16141071 |title=The Effect of Diurnal Correction on Satellite-Derived Lower Tropospheric Temperature |journal=Science |volume=309 |issue=5740 |pages=1548–51 |year=2005 |last1=Mears |first1=C.

The process of deriving trends from SSUs measurement has proved particularly difficult because of satellites drift, inter-calibration between different satellite with scant overlap and gas leak in the instrument carbon dioxide pressure cell, furthermore since the radiances measured by SSUs are due to emission by [[carbon dioxide]] the weighting functions move to higher altitudes as the carbon dioxide concentration in the stratosphere increase.
Mid to upper stratosphere temperature show strong negative trend interspersed by transient volcanic warming after the explosive volcanic eruptions of [[El Chichón]] and [[Mount Pinatubo]], little temperature trend has been observed since 1995.

===Comparison to instrumental record===
[[Image:Radiosonde Satellite Surface Temperature.svg|thumb|1958-2011 radiosonde, satellite and surface temperature record.]]

The satellite records have the advantage of global coverage, whereas the radiosonde record is longer. There have been complaints of data problems with both records.

To compare to the trend from the [[Instrumental temperature record|surface temperature record]] (+0.161{{Plusmn}}0.033&amp;nbsp;°C/decade from 1979 to 2012 according to NASA GISS&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter02_FINAL.pdf|title=IPCC AR5 WG1 Chapter 2: Observations Atmosphere and Surface|last=|first=|date=2013|website=ipcc.ch|publisher=Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change|page=193|access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;) it is most appropriate to derive trends for the part of the atmosphere nearest the surface, i.e., the lower [[troposphere]]. Doing this, through January 2017:

The IPCC fifth assessment report concluded: " based on multiple independent analyses of measurements from radiosondes and satellite sensors it is virtually certain that globally the troposphere has warmed and the stratosphere has cooled since the mid-20th century. Despite unanimous agreement on the sign of the trends, substantial disagreement exists among available estimates as to the rate of temperature changes, particularly outside the NH extratropical troposphere, which has been well sampled by radiosondes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter02_FINAL.pdf IPCC AR5 WG1 Chapter 2 page 196]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reconciliation with climate models==
{{See also|Climate model|Global warming}}

Surface temperature data showed substantial global average warming, while early versions of satellite and radiosonde data showed little or no warming above the surface. While the satellite  data now show global warming, there is still a significant difference between what [[General circulation model|Climate models]] predict and what the satellite data show for warming of the lower troposphere with the climate models predicting significantly more warming than what the satellites measure.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.remss.com/research/climate|title=Climate Analysis: Tropospheric Temperature|last=|first=|date=2017|website=remss.com|publisher=Remote Sensing Systems|access-date=3 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The climate models also overpredict the results of the radiosonde measurements.{{cn|date=February 2017}}

The most recent climate model simulations give a range of results for changes in global average temperature. Some models show more warming in the troposphere than at the surface, while a slightly smaller number of simulations show the opposite behavior. There is no fundamental inconsistency among these model results and observations at the global scale,&lt;ref name="SAP1_1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/bibliography/related_files/tmlw0602.pdf|title=Executive Summary: Temperature Trends in the Lower Atmosphere - Understanding and Reconciling Differences|date=2 May 2006|publisher=United States Global Climate Change Research Program|author1=Tom M.

In summary, despite unanimous agreement on the sign of the observed trends, there exists substantial disagreement between available estimates as to the rate of temperature changes in the tropical troposphere, and there is only low confidence in the rate of change and its vertical structure."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.ipcc.ch/pdf/assessment-report/ar5/wg1/WG1AR5_Chapter09_FINAL.pdf IPCC AR5 WG1 Chapter 9 page 772]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Historic differences===

{{See also|UAH_satellite_temperature_dataset#Corrections_made}}
For some time the only available satellite record was the UAH version, which (with early versions of the processing [[algorithm]]) showed a global cooling trend for its first decade. Since then, a longer record and a number of corrections to the processing have revised this picture: the UAH dataset has shown an overall warming trend since 1998, though less than the RSS version. In 2001, an extensive comparison and discussion of trends from different data sources and periods was given in the [[Third Assessment Report]] of the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC)  (section 2.2.4).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/060.htm United Nations Environment Programme] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110112044011/http://www.grida.no/climate/ipcc_tar/wg1/060.htm |date=12 January 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2017, RSS released v4 which significantly increased the trend making the difference between RSS and UAH substantial again.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.carbonbrief.org/major-correction-to-satellite-data-shows-140-faster-warming-since-1998 Major correction to satellite data shows 140% faster warming since 1998] Carbon Brief 30 June 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9930">The '''scenario approach''' or '''scenario optimization approach''' is a technique for obtaining solutions to [[robust optimization]] and [[chance-constrained optimization]] problems based on a sample of the [[constraint (mathematics)|constraint]]s. It also relates to [[inductive reasoning]] in modeling and decision-making. The technique has existed for decades as a [[heuristic]] approach and has more recently been given a systematic theoretical foundation.

== Description ==

In [[Optimization (mathematics)|optimization]], robustness features translate into constraints that are parameterized by the uncertain elements of the problem. In the scenario method&lt;ref&gt;G. Calafiore and M.C. Campi. ''Uncertain Convex Programs: Randomized Solutions and Confidence Levels.'' Mathematical Programming, 102: 25&amp;ndash;46, 2005. [http://www.springerlink.com/content/qlcbr9eg3dne6ldb/?p=ad759ab4ef9f49049f9b5ef14e7b00ee&amp;pi=1]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. Calafiore and M.C. Campi. "The scenario approach to robust control design," IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, 51(5). 742-753, 2006. [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/login.jsp?tp=&amp;arnumber=1632303&amp;url=http%3A%2F%2Fieeexplore.ieee.org%2Fxpls%2Fabs_all.jsp%3Farnumber%3D1632303]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;M.C. Campi and S. Garatti. ''The Exact Feasibility of Randomized Solutions of Uncertain Convex Programs.'' SIAM J. on Optimization, 19, no.3: 1211&amp;ndash;1230, 2008.[http://epubs.siam.org/siopt/resource/1/sjope8/v19/i3/p1211_s1]&lt;/ref&gt;, a solution is obtained by only looking at a random sample of constraints ([[heuristic]] approach) called ''scenarios'' and a deeply-grounded theory tells the user how “robust” the corresponding solution is related to other constraints. This theory justifies the use of [[randomization]] in robust and chance-constrained optimization.

== Data-driven optimization ==
At times, scenarios are obtained as random extractions from a model. More often, however, scenarios are instances of the uncertain constraints that are obtained as observations ([[data-driven science]]). In this latter case, no model of uncertainty is needed to generate scenarios. Moreover, most remarkably, also in this case scenario optimization comes accompanied by a full-fledged theory because all scenario optimization results are distribution-free and can therefore be applied even when a model of uncertainty is not available.

== Theoretical results ==
For constraints that are [[convex optimization|convex]] (e.g. in [[semidefinite programming|semidefinite problems]] involving [[Linear matrix inequality|LMIs, Linear Matrix Inequalities]]), a deep theoretical analysis has been established which shows that the probability that a new constraint is not satisfied follows a distribution that is dominated by a [[Beta distribution]]. This result is tight since it is exact for a whole class of convex problems.&lt;ref&gt;M.C. Campi and S. Garatti. ''The Exact Feasibility of Randomized Solutions of Uncertain Convex Programs.'' SIAM J. on Optimization, 19, no.3: 1211&amp;ndash;1230, 2008.[http://epubs.siam.org/siopt/resource/1/sjope8/v19/i3/p1211_s1]&lt;/ref&gt; More generally, various empirical levels have been shown to follow a [[Dirichlet distribution]], whose marginals are beta distribution.&lt;ref&gt; A. Caré, S. Garatti and M.C. Campi.''Scenario min-max optimization and the risk of empirical costs ''. SIAM Journal on Optimization, 25, no.4: 2061-2080, 2015, Mathematical Programming, published online, 2016. [http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/130928546]&lt;/ref&gt; The scenario approach with &lt;math&gt;L_1&lt;/math&gt; regularization has also been considered&lt;ref&gt; M.C. Campi and A. Carè. ''Random convex programs with L1-regularization: sparsity and generalization''. SIAM Journal on Control and Optimization, 51, no.5: 3532-3557, 2013.

Campi. ''FAST - Fast Algorithm for the Scenario Technique''. Operations Research, 62, no.3: 662-671, 2014. [https://pubsonline.informs.org/doi/abs/10.1287/opre.2014.1257]&lt;/ref&gt; Extensions to more complex, non-convex, set-ups are still objects of active investigation.

Along the scenario approach, it is also possible to pursue a risk-return trade-off.&lt;ref&gt;M.C. Campi and S. Garatti. ''A Sampling-and-Discarding Approach to Chance-Constrained Optimization: Feasibility and Optimality''. Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications, 148, Number 2, 257&amp;ndash;280, 2011 (preliminary version published in Optimization Online, 2008). [http://www.springerlink.com/content/a0146681n6878894/]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G.C. Calafiore. ''Random Convex Programs''. SIAM J. on Optimization, 20(6) 3427-3464, 2010. [http://epubs.siam.org/doi/abs/10.1137/090773490]&lt;/ref&gt;  Moreover, a full-fledged method can be used to apply this approach to control.&lt;ref&gt;S. Garatti and M.C. Campi. ''Modulating Robustness in Control Design: Principles and Algorithms.''. IEEE Control Systems Magazine, 33, 36&amp;#x2013;51, 2013. [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/xpl/articleDetails.jsp?arnumber=6479421&amp;filter%3DAND%28p_IS_Number%3A6479381%29]&lt;/ref&gt; First &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; constraints are sampled and then the user starts removing some of the constraints in succession. This can be done in different ways, even according to greedy algorithms. After elimination of one more constraint, the optimal solution is updated, and the corresponding optimal value is determined. As this procedure moves on, the user constructs an empirical “curve of values”, i.e. the curve representing the value achieved after the removing of an increasing number of constraints. The scenario theory provides precise evaluations of how robust the various solutions are. 

A remarkable advance in the theory has been established by the recent wait-and-judge approach&lt;ref&gt;M.C. Campi and S. Garatti. ''Wait-and-judge scenario optimization.''. Mathematical Programming, published online, 2016. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10107-016-1056-9?view=classic]&lt;/ref&gt;: one assesses the complexity of the solution (as precisely defined in the referenced article) and from its value formulates precise evaluations on the robustness of the solution. These results shed light on deeply-grounded links between the concepts of complexity and risk. A related approach, named "Repetitive Scenario Design" aims at reducing the sample complexity of the solution by repeatedly alternating a scenario design phase (with reduced number of samples) with a randomized check of the feasibility of the ensuing solution.&lt;ref&gt;G.C. Calafiore. ''Repetitive Scenario Design.''  IEEE Transactions on Automatic Control, Vol. 62, Issue 3, March 2017, pp. 1125-1137. [http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/7484339/]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Example ==

Consider a function &lt;math&gt;R_\delta(x)&lt;/math&gt; which represents the return of an [[investment]]; it depends on our vector of investment choices &lt;math&gt;x&lt;/math&gt; and on the market state &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt; which will be experienced at the end of the investment period.

Given a stochastic model for the market conditions, we consider &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; of the possible states &lt;math&gt;\delta_1, \dots, \delta_N&lt;/math&gt; (randomization of uncertainty). Alternatively, the scenarios &lt;math&gt;\delta_i&lt;/math&gt; can be obtained from a record of observations. 

We set out to solve the scenario optimization program

: &lt;math&gt;\max_x \min_{i=1,\dots,N} R_{\delta_i}(x). \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ \ (1)&lt;/math&gt;

This corresponds to choosing a portfolio vector ''x'' so as to obtain the best possible return in the worst-case scenario.&lt;ref&gt;B.K. Pagnoncelli, D. Reich and M.C. Campi. ''Risk-Return Trade-off with the Scenario Approach in Practice: A Case Study in Portfolio Selection''. Journal of Optimization Theory and Applications, 155: 707-722, 2012. [https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10957-012-0074-x]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G.C. Calafiore. ''Direct data-driven portfolio optimization with guaranteed shortfall probability''. Automatica, 49(2) 370-380, 2013. [http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0005109812005481]&lt;/ref&gt;

After solving (1), an optimal investment strategy &lt;math&gt;x^\ast&lt;/math&gt; is achieved along with the corresponding optimal return &lt;math&gt;R^\ast&lt;/math&gt;. While &lt;math&gt;R^\ast&lt;/math&gt; has been obtained by looking at &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; possible market states only, the scenario theory tells us that the solution is robust up to a level &lt;math&gt;\epsilon&lt;/math&gt;, that is, the return &lt;math&gt;R^\ast&lt;/math&gt; will be achieved with probability &lt;math&gt;1 - \epsilon&lt;/math&gt; for other market states. 

In quantitative finance, the worst-case approach can be overconservative. One alternative is to discard some odd situations to reduce pessimism&lt;ref&gt;M.C. Campi and S. Garatti.

[http://www.springerlink.com/content/a0146681n6878894/]&lt;/ref&gt;; moreover, scenario optimization can be applied to other risk-measures including CVaR - Conditional Value at Risk, so adding to the flexibility of its use.&lt;ref&gt;M.C.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4316">'''Project Starlight''' is a research project of the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] to develop a fleet of laser beam-propelled spacecraft and sending them to a star neighboring the Solar System, potentially [[Alpha Centauri]]. The project aims to send organisms on board the spacecraft.&lt;ref name="economist2017"&gt;{{cite news |date=November 2, 2017 |title=The first voyager to another star may be a worm or a tardigrade |url=https://www.economist.com/news/science-and-technology/21730862-life-fast-lane-first-voyager-another-star-may-be-worm-or |newspaper=[[The Economist]] |accessdate=2017-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
Starlight aims to accelerate the spacecrafts with powerful lasers, a method the project refers to as [[DEEP-IN]] (Directed Energy Propulsion for Interstellar Exploration),&lt;ref name="starlightpage"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deepspace.ucsb.edu/projects/starlight |title=Starlight Directed Energy for Relativistic Interstellar Missions |publisher=[[University of California, Santa Barbara]] |access-date=2017-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; thus allowing them to reach stars near the Solar System in a matter of years, in contrast to traditional propulsion methods which will require thousands of years. Each spacecraft will be the size of a DVD disc and will be powered by plutonium.&lt;ref name="economist2017"/&gt; They will fly at one-fifth of the speed of light, and in the case of Alpha Centauri, it will arrive after traveling more than twenty years from Earth.&lt;ref name="economist2017"/&gt; Starlight is a program of the Experimental Cosmology Group of [[University of California, Santa Barbara]] (UCSB), and has received funding from NASA.&lt;ref name="economist2017"/&gt; In 2015, the [[NASA Innovative Advanced Concepts]] (NIAC) selected DEEP-IN as a phase-1 project.&lt;ref name="niac2015"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.nasa.gov/feature/deep-in-directed-energy-propulsion-for-interstellar-exploration |title=DEEP IN Directed Energy Propulsion for Interstellar Exploration |publisher=NASA |access-date=2017-12-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Terrestrial biomes in space==
[[File:CelegansGoldsteinLabUNC.jpg|thumb|right|Sent onboard Starlight, ''C. elegans'' may become the first terrestrial microbe to reach Alpha Centauri]]
One goal of Starlight is to send terrestrial organisms along with the spacecraft, and observe how the interstellar environment and extreme acceleration affects them. This effort is known as ''Terrestrial Biomes in Space'', and the lead candidate is ''[[Caenorhabditis elegans]]'', a minuscule [[nematode]].&lt;ref name="economist2017"/&gt; The organism will spend most of the voyage in a frozen state, and once the spacecraft approaches its target they will be thawed by heat from the onboard plutonium.&lt;ref name="economist2017"/&gt; Following their revival, the organisms will be monitored by various sensors, and the data they produce will be sent back to Earth. ''C. elegans'' have been used extensively in biological research as a [[model organism]], owing to the fact that the worm has one of the least number of cells for an animal possessing a nervous system. A backup option for ''C. elegans'' are [[tardigrade]]s, [[micro-animals]] that are known for their resilience to various conditions lethal to other animals, such as the vacuum environment of space and strong doses of ionizing radiation.&lt;ref name="economist2017"/&gt;

===Planetary protection===
NASA's funding does not cover the ''Terrestrial Biome in Space'' portion of Starlight, as the experiment may potentially contaminate [[exoplanets]].&lt;ref name="economist2017"/&gt;

The Tama '''Iron Cobra''' is a bass drum pedal line made between 1992 and the present. They are a full-baseplate, double chain or kevlar strap drive, professional quality [[bass drum]] pedal used by many leading [[drummer]]s. The Iron Cobra comes in both single and double pedal configurations with 3 different drive choices and, recently, a longboard Speed Cobra option. Tama also produces an Iron Cobra Junior pedal for the beginner/intermediate audience. The pedal's initial popularity was in its adjustability, but it has also become known for its durability over time.

==History==
[[Tama Drums]] introduced the first Iron Cobra pedal prototype in 1992. This pedal had some of the eventual features of the production Iron Cobras but, with quickly machined, blocky parts, it looked quite a bit less refined than the eventual consumer version.

In 1993 the first generation Iron Cobra went on the market. The pedals looked similar to previous Tama models, having the typical silver, squared off footboard of the Tama pedals of the 1980s. The main difference with the new Cobra was the added adjustability of many of the components. The pedal was offered in a slightly less adjustable standard version and a full-featured professional version. The pedal was mostly the native silver color of the metal, with a few black painted details.

In 1998 the second generation Iron Cobra was released. This version had a more refined, curved footboard, updated branding and logo, and a black powder-coated finish. The [[ball bearings|bearings]] were upgraded and the hoop clamp was upgraded. All of the adjustment mechanisms were refined for the second generation, as the pedal had built its name on adjustability the past 5 years. Around this time was when the standard non-professional version became known as the Iron Cobra Junior. The Junior version had only a single [[chain]] drive, as opposed to the double chain of the full professional version.&lt;ref name="uberproaudio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.uberproaudio.com/articles/14-reviews/71-tama-iron-cobra-pedal-vs-hp200-iron-cobra-jr|title=Tama Iron Cobra pedal vs HP200 Iron Cobra Jr|publisher=uberproaudio.com|accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011 the third generation Iron Cobra came out with a new set of features. The pedal retained the black styling of the second generation, but with a few changes in features. This Cobra had a footboard surface that was smoother, the bearing housing was redesigned, the cam shapes were altered slightly, and the baseplate came with a feature called the Cobra Coil. The Cobra coil was a [[Spring (device)|spring]] mounted beneath the footboard that was supposed to increase speed and responsiveness. Unlike the other upgrades, this Cobra Coil feature is unique to the Iron Cobra line and has come to be seen as a gimmick, rather than a true upgrade, adding very little to the playability of the pedals.&lt;ref name="tamadrum"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamadrum.co.jp/ironcobra_20th/history_e.html|title=Iron Cobra 20th Anniversary - History &amp;#124; TAMA Drums|author=HOSHINO GAKKI CO., LTD.|publisher=tamadrum.co.jp|accessdate=2015-11-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150926003446/http://www.tamadrum.co.jp/ironcobra_20th/history_e.html|archivedate=2015-09-26|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013 the third generation pedals were joined by two new variants, the duo-glide, which allowed the [[cam]] shape to be altered,&lt;ref name="musicradar"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.musicradar.com/reviews/drums/tama-iron-cobra-600-series-pedal-576058|title=Tama Iron Cobra 600 Series pedal review &amp;#124; MusicRadar|publisher=musicradar.com|accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Speed Cobra, a longboard version with a unique light sprocket cam, new fastball bearing type, and a different beater shape.&lt;ref name="tamadrum2"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tamadrum.co.jp/speedcobra/|title=SpeedCobra &amp;#124; TAMA Drums|author=HOSHINO GAKKI CO., LTD.|publisher=tamadrum.co.jp|accessdate=2015-11-23|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160123144516/http://www.tamadrum.co.jp/speedcobra/|archivedate=2016-01-23|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Features==
Since the beginning the Iron Cobra was known for adjustability. Through all the generations, the pedal has had the ability to adjust the footboard angle independently of the beater shaft angle, adjust the beater head angle, adjust the hoop clamp size, adjust the beater shaft length, adjust the feel of the beater with a sliding weight, and adjust the spring tension. Not all of these adjustments are universally possible on all other pedals from other manufacturers.&lt;ref name="drummertalk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drummertalk.org/2009/10/31/gear-review-tama-iron-cobra/|title=Gear Review &amp;#8211; Tama Iron Cobra|publisher=drummertalk.org|accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The cam shape is not adjustable on the Iron Cobra, except on the third gen. duo-glide model, but the pedal has historically been offered with two different optional cams. The rolling-glide cam is round for a smooth action, while the powerglide cam changes radius mid-stroke for more acceleration. While most of the Iron Cobra pedals are double chain drive, the flexi-glide version has a [[kevlar]] strap drive. Since at least the second generation, the pedals have come with a hard plastic carrying case.&lt;ref name="drumgearreview"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.drumgearreview.com/2011/03/19/tama-iron-cobra-single-pedal/|title=&amp;raquo; Tama Iron Cobra Single Pedal - Drum Gear Review|publisher=drumgearreview.com|accessdate=2015-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''FracTracker Alliance''' is a 501(c)(3) non-profit that shares maps, images, data, and analysis related to the oil and gas industry hoping that a better informed public will be able to make better informed decisions regarding the world's energy future.&lt;ref name=about&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fractracker.org/about-us/|publisher=FracTracker|title=About Us|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FracTracker's information is focused in large part on unconventional extraction methods.&lt;ref name=sh&gt;{{cite news|last=Pryts|first=Monica|title=FracMapper site lets users pinpoint local gas/oil drilling|url=http://www.sharonherald.com/business/x1340804431/FracMapper-site-lets-users-pinpoint-local-gas-oil-drilling|accessdate=6 February 2014|newspaper=Sharon Herald|date=3 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;  FracTracker Alliance is based in the United States and has offices in [[Camp Hill, Pennsylvania]]; [[Pittsburgh]], [[Pennsylvania]]; Cleveland, Ohio; Washington, DC; New York; Berkeley, and California.&lt;ref name=about/&gt;

FracTracker reportedly aims to provide non-partisan information, and has no official position on the practice of [[hydraulic fracturing]].&lt;ref name=sh/&gt;

==History==

FracTracker Alliance originated as FracTracker.org, a project of the [[Center for Healthy Environments and Communities]] at the [[University of Pittsburgh Graduate School of Public Health]] with the objective of crowd-sourcing data concerning unconventional gas extraction from the [[Marcellus Shale]].&lt;ref name=bj/&gt;  Between 2010 and early 2012, FracTracker was funded by grants from The [[Heinz Endowments]] and The [[William Penn Foundation]].&lt;ref name=bj&gt;{{cite news|last=Kobell|first=Rona|title=Website collects, lets people track shale-drilling data in their area|url=http://www.bayjournal.com/article/website_collects_lets_people_track_shale_drilling_data_in_their_area|accessdate=6 February 2014|newspaper=Bay Journal|date=1 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

FracTracker.org's original director, Dr. Volz, left the University of Pittsburgh in April 2011.&lt;ref name=pcm&gt;{{cite news|last=Smit|first=Deb|title=What's next for Dan Volz?|url=http://www.popcitymedia.com/features/danvolz042011.aspx|accessdate=6 February 2014|newspaper=PopCityMedia|date=17 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after Dr. Volz left the University, FracTracker.org split off from the University as well (in early 2012), and formed a new non-profit named The FracTracker Alliance.&lt;ref name=bj/&gt; Many members of the original team from the [[University of Pittsburgh]] who had been working on FracTracker.org left the University to work for the new non-profit as (or shortly after) it was created.&lt;ref name=bj/&gt;

==Current Initiatives==

===Mapping===
FracTracker Alliance is known for its mapping of energy issues, available on FracTracker.org&lt;ref name=fm2/&gt;  FracTracker offers a variety of maps detailing drilling-related activity, and more recently renewable energy progress on its website. FracTracker's [https://www.fractracker.org/data/ data] comes from a variety of sources including state environmental agencies, news reports, [[freedom of information]] requests, user reports, collaborations with other groups, and information from other agencies.  FracTracker makes its data available for download, and makes clear where the data came from by including a variety of metadata along with its data (e.g. information about who created the original content, what is included in the dataset, when the dataset was taken, where the data features were located, and information about any changes from the original dataset).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Data Statement|url=http://www.fractracker.org/about-us/data-statement/|publisher=FracTracker|accessdate=7 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; FracTracker.org also offers regular in-person trainings about how to use their mapping tools.

FracTracker.org originally used a proprietary mapping system designed by Rhiza Labs in Pittsburgh,&lt;ref name=rhiza&gt;{{cite news|first=University of Pittsburgh|last=Press Release|title=Pitt Center Launches Online Tracking Tool to Assess Impact of Marcellus Shale Drilling|url=http://upmcbeaconhospital.com/media/NewsReleases/2010/Pages/pitt-center-launches-online-tracking-tool-assess-impact-marcellus-shale-drilling.aspx|accessdate=18 September 2018|date=29 June 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  but transitioned to a customized mapping platform based on [[Esri]]'s ARCGis Online that allows users to download full datasets both through FracTracker and through Esri.&lt;ref name=fm2&gt;{{cite web|last=Malone|first=Sam|url=http://www.fractracker.org/2012/09/fracmapper/|title=Unveiling FracMapper, FracTracker’s new mapping system!|accessdate=6 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fee-for-service===

FracTracker Alliance collaborates with many other nonprofit organizations, providing them with visualizations and information that help them communicate about energy choices and their impacts. These services are typically provided on a pro-bono basis, but for larger projects they apply a fee-for-service structure.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.fractracker.org/about-us/fee-for-service/|title=Fee-for-Service Structure / FracTracker Alliance|accessdate=18 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Czek.podrozniczy.1000zl.NBP.1989.jpeg|thumb|Obverse and reverse side of traveller's cheque of [[National Bank of Poland]] (nominal value: 1000 [[Polish złoty]]); sold in April 1989 in [[Budapest]] ([[Hungary]]), for use during travel to Poland only, never used.]]

A '''traveler's cheque'''{{efn|Alternatively spelt as ''traveller's check'', particularly in [[American English]]. See also [[differences between British English and American English]].}} is a [[medium of exchange]] that can be used in place of hard currency. They can be denominated in one of a number of major world currencies and are preprinted, fixed-amount [[cheque]]s designed to allow the person signing it to make an unconditional payment to someone else as a result of having paid the issuer for that privilege.  

They were generally used by people on vacation in foreign countries instead of cash, as many businesses used to accept traveler's cheques as currency. The incentive for merchants and other parties to accept them lay in the fact that as long as the original signature (which the buyer is supposed to place on the cheque in ink as soon as they receive the cheque) and the signature made at the time the cheque is used are the same, the cheque's issuer will unconditionally guarantee payment of the face amount even if the cheque was fraudulently issued, stolen, or lost. This means that a traveler's cheque can never 'bounce' unless the issuer goes bankrupt and out of business. If a traveler's cheque were lost or stolen, it can be replaced by the issuing financial institution. 

The financial institutions issuing traveler's cheques earn income in a number of ways. Firstly, they would charge a fee on sale of such cheques. In addition, they can earn interest for the period that the cheques are uncashed, while not paying any interest to the cheque holder, making them effectively interest-free loans. Also, the [[foreign exchange rate]] commonly used on traveler's cheques (generally based on rates applicable at the time of purchase) is less favourable compared to other forms of obtaining foreign currency, especially those on credit card transactions (which use a rate applicable at the statement date). On the other hand, the set up cost and the cost of issuing and processing traveler's cheques is much higher than for credit card transactions. The cheque issuer carries the [[exchange rate risk]], and would normally pay a fee to [[Hedge (finance)|hedge]] against the risk.

Their use has been in decline since the 1990s, when a variety of more convenient alternatives, such as [[credit card]]s, [[debit card]]s, [[pre-paid currency cards]] and [[automated teller machine]]s, became more widely available and were easier for travelers to use. Traveler's cheques are no longer widely accepted and cannot easily be cashed, even at the banks that issued them. The alternatives to traveler's cheques were generally cheaper and more flexible. Travel money cards offer similar features to traveler's cheques, including prepurchase of foreign currency at rates applicable at date of purchase, but offer greater ease and flexibility, such as use like a regular credit card, no need to get change in a local currency, besides other features.

== Terminology ==
Legally, the parties to traveler's cheque transactions are as follows. The organization that produces a traveler's cheque is the '''obligor''' or '''issuer'''. The bank or other place that sells it is the '''agent''' of the issuer. The [[natural person]] who buys the cheque is the '''purchaser'''. The entity to whom the purchaser hands the cheque in payment for goods or services is the '''payee''' or '''merchant'''. For purposes of clearance, the obligor is both '''maker''' and '''drawee'''.

== History ==
Traveler's cheques were first issued on 1 January 1772 by the ''London Credit Exchange Company'' for use in 90 European cities,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://archive.thisislancashire.co.uk/2005/1/3/452155.html | title=On this day – January 3 | website=thisislancashire.co.uk | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081015161253/http://archive.thisislancashire.co.uk/2005/1/3/452155.html | archivedate=October 15, 2008 | df= }} &lt;/ref&gt; and in 1874, [[Thomas Cook &amp; Son|Thomas Cook]] was issuing '[[circular note]]s' that operated in the manner of traveler's cheques.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.competition-commission.gov.uk/rep_pub/reports/1995/fulltext/361c3.pdf |title=Home |website=competition-commission.gov.uk |publisher=Competition Commission |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120106005443/http://www.competition-commission.gov.uk/rep_pub/reports/1995/fulltext/361c3.pdf |archivedate=2012-01-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[American Express]] developed a large-scale international traveler's cheque system in 1891, to supersede the traditional [[letter of credit|letters of credit]].&lt;ref name= Time56&gt;{{cite journal| url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,866900-7,00.html |title= Host With The Most| journal= [[Time (magazine)|Time]] |date= 9 April 1956| access-date= | subscription= yes}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is still the largest issuer of traveler's cheques today by volume.  American Express's introduction of traveler's cheques is traditionally attributed to employee [[Marcellus Flemming Berry]], after company president [[J.C. Fargo]] had problems in smaller European cities obtaining funds with a letter of credit.

Between the 1650s and the 1990s, traveler's cheques became one of the main ways that people took money on vacation for use in foreign countries without the risks associated with carrying large amounts of cash.

Several brands of travelers cheques have been marketed; the most familiar of those were [[Thomas Cook Group]], [[Bank of America]] and American Express.

=== Declining use ===
The convenience and wider acceptance of such alternatives as [[credit cards|credit]] and [[debit cards]] and the wider availability of [[Automatic teller machine|ATM]]s has led to a significant decline in the use of traveler's cheques since the 1990s. In addition, security concerns of retailers has led to many businesses ceasing to accept them, in turn making them less attractive to travelers. This has led to complaints about the difficulty that holders have in using them. In much of Europe and Asia, traveler's cheques are no longer widely accepted and cannot be easily cashed, even at the banks that issued them.

Since traveler's cheques do not earn interest, one of the main incentives financial institutions have to sell traveler's cheques is that they effectively represent an interest-free loan from the purchaser to the seller. The sustained decline in interest rates in most of the developed world since the early-to-mid 1990s has substantially reduced the profitability of traveler's cheques for their issuers. Financial institutions have responded to this development by charging new fees for traveler's cheques, increasing existing fees, or by exiting the business altogether.

== Usage ==
=== Purchasing cheques for later use ===
Traveler's cheques are sold by banks and agencies to customers for use at a later time. Upon obtaining custody of a purchased supply of traveler's cheques, the purchaser would immediately sign each cheque. The purchaser will also receive a receipt and some other documentation that should be kept in a safe place other than where they carry the cheques. Traveler's cheques can usually be replaced if lost or stolen, assuming the owner still has the receipt issued with the purchase of the cheques showing the serial numbers allocated.

=== Cashing cheques ===
To cash a traveler's cheque to make a purchase, the purchaser would, in the presence of the payee, date and [[countersign (legal)|countersign]] the cheque in the indicated space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www209.americanexpress.com/merchant/singlevoice/USEng/FrontServlet?request_type=navigate&amp;page=travelersChequesAndGiftCheques |title=Accepting American Express Travelers Cheques – watch out for fraud |accessdate=July 17, 2012 |publisher=[[American Express]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Denomination and change ===
Traveler's cheques are available in several currencies such as [[United States dollar|U.S. dollars]], [[Canadian dollar]]s, [[Pound sterling|Pounds sterling]], [[Japanese yen]], [[Chinese Yuan]] and [[Euro]]; denominations usually being 20, 50, or 100 (x100 for Yen) of whatever currency, and are usually sold in pads of five or ten cheques, e.g., 5 × €20 for €100. Traveler's cheques do not expire, so unused cheques can be kept by the purchaser to spend at any time in the future. The purchaser of a supply of traveler's cheques effectively gives an interest-free loan to the issuer, which is why it is common for banks to sell them "commission free" to their customers. The commission, where it is charged, is usually 1–2% of the total face value sold.

Any change for a purchase transaction would be given in the local currency.

=== Deposit and settlement ===
A payee receiving a traveler's cheque would follow its normal procedures for depositing cheques into its bank account: usually, endorsement by stamp or signature and listing the cheque and its amount on the deposit slip. The bank account will be credited with the amount of the cheque as with any other negotiable item submitted for clearance.

In the [[United States]], if the payee is equipped to process cheques electronically at point of sale (''see:'' [[Check 21 Act]]), they would still take custody of the cheque and submit it to a financial institution, particularly to avoid any confusion on the part of the purchaser.

== Security issues ==
One of the main advantages traveler's cheques provide is the replacement if lost or stolen. 

However, this feature has also created a black market where fraudsters buy traveler's cheques, sell them at 50% of their value to other people (such as travelers) and falsely report their traveler's cheque stolen with the company from which the cheque was obtained.  As such, they get back the value of the traveler's cheque and make 50% of the value as profit.&lt;ref&gt;Handboek voor de Wereldreiziger by Frans Timmerhuis&lt;/ref&gt;

The widespread problem of counterfeit traveler's cheques has caused a number of businesses to no longer accept them or to impose stringent safeguards when they are used.  It is a reasonable security procedure for the payee to ask to inspect the purchaser's [[identity document|picture ID]]; a driver's license or passport should suffice, and doing so would most usefully be towards the end of comparing the purchaser's signature on the ID with those on the cheque. The best first step, however, that can be taken by any payee who has concerns about the validity of any traveler's cheque, is to contact the issuer directly; a negative finding by a third-party [[cheque verification service]] based on an ID check may merely indicate that the service has no record about the purchaser (to be expected, practically by definition, of many travelers), or at worst that they have been deemed incompetent to manage a personal chequing account (which would have no bearing on the validity of a traveler's cheque).

Some purchasers have found the process of filing a claim for lost or stolen cheques is cumbersome, and have been left without recourse after their cheques were lost or stolen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consumeraffairs.com/credit_cards/amex_travelers_cheques.html |title=Top 31 Complaints and Reviews about American Express Travelers Cheques |publisher=Consumeraffairs.com |date= |accessdate=2014-03-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Alternatives ==
The widespread acceptance of credit cards and debit cards around the world starting in the 1980s and 1990s significantly replaced the use of traveler's cheques for paying for things on vacation.

In 2005, American Express released the ''American Express Travelers Cheque Card'', a [[stored-value card]] that serves the same purposes as a traveler's cheque, but can be used in stores like a credit card. It discontinued the card in October 2007.  A number of other financial companies went on to issue stored-value or [[Prepaid debit card#Prepaid debit cards|pre-paid debit cards]] containing several currencies that could be used like credit or debit cards at shops and at ATMs, mimicking the traveler's cheque in electronic form. One of the major examples is the [[Visa Inc.|Visa]] TravelMoney card.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://europeforvisitors.com/europe/articles/amex-travelfunds-visa-travelmoney-cards.htm |title=Visa TravelMoney Cards |publisher=europeforvisitors.com |accessdate=January 3, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;!-- Unsourced image removed: [[File:Fig5.Verreville.jpg|thumb|right|A pottery kiln within the glassworking cone. After the glass cone went out of use (c. 1840) a number of small pottery kilns were built within it, reusing the glass cone building to house them.]] --&gt;

'''Verreville Glassworks''' was established on the north bank of the [[River Clyde]] in the village of [[Finnieston]] in 1777. Glass making was discontinued in 1842. The buildings of the works, including the 120 feet high glasshouse cone, were converted into a pottery works which remained in production until 1918.
[[File:Fig1.Verreville.jpg|thumb|left|Aerial view of site under excavation. The River Clyde can be seen in the background. This area was the centre of major industry in Glasgow in the 19th and early 20th century.]]

In addition to a rich historical and documentary archive, evidence for the operations and technology of these industries was gained from excavations in 2005. The [[industrial archaeology|archaeological excavation]], carried out by [[Headland Archaeology]] uncovered several buildings and structures relating to both the glass and the pottery works.

==Historical background==

The Verreville Glassworks was established by a group of Glasgow merchants in 1777. Workmen were brought from England and Germany to build the cone, a major Glasgow landmark of its day, which reached a height of 120 feet. The company amalgamated with the Glasgow Bottlework Company in c. 1786 and in 1806 the business was sold to the Dumbarton Glass Company. The new business was immediately sold to John Geddes, on the condition that he did not make window glass or bottles.

John Geddes founded the '''‘Glasgow and Verreville Glass and Pottery Company’''', which quickly established itself and developed an export trade to North America and Ireland. However, pottery production was a very competitive market and Geddes was soon declared bankrupt. In 1830 the pottery was taken over by Robert Montgomery, a former manager. Montgomery’s involvement with the pottery was short-lived and by 1833 he too was declared bankrupt. The glassworks were closed in 1834.

The glassworks and John Geddes’ house and grounds (Verreville House) were bought by Robert Alexander Kidston who was a partner in the nearby Anderston Pottery (often called Lancefield Pottery). By this time the pottery had two earthenware kilns and one china kiln. Kidston tried to raise the quality of the products - he added the production of porcelain, imported Staffordshire workers and extended the works into the grounds of Verreville House – but by 1841 he himself was in financial trouble and the firm was taken over by a consortium, one of whom was Robert Cochran, whose family later owned the much larger Britannia Pottery in Glasgow. Glassmaking appears to have ceased production in 1842 and a number of small pottery kilns were built inside the original glassworks cone. Only white and earthenwares were being made by this time. The Cochran family remained in charge of the pottery until its eventual closure in 1918.

The [[Headland Archaeology|Headland excavations]] in 2005 revealed several features related to three major phases of development: glass manufacturing activity (c. 1777 – mid-1840s), pottery manufacturing phase (late 1840s – c. 1859) and the later pottery works (after c. 1859 – c. 1918).

===Glass Manufacturing Activity===
;The Glassworking Cone

The earliest phase of activity identified on site was associated with the [[glass production|production of glass]].  Evidence for the glass cone structure was identified by four evenly spaced brick built piers. These were constructed of hand made red bricks and formed a half circle in plan. It is probable that this is the remains of the northern half of the original octagonal glass cone structure built in 1777. These piers possibly supported an arcaded external wall, allowing access to the interior of the glass cone.

Leading into the central area of the ‘glass cone’ was a series of [[flue]]s. The largest was constructed of hand made red brick with a vaulted ceiling. The interior of the brick was blackened by soot and the floor was blackened natural sand, which contained a large quaintly of broken glass or [[cullet]]. These flues would have pulled cold air into a central (unidentified) glass [[furnace]], obliterated by the post-1920s buildings.

;The Glassworking Hovel

The sub square building (hovel), which housed the glass cone was only identified by one wall during the excavation. Two lengths of hand made red brick wall, interpreted as the original northern wall of the hovel were excavated. Truncated by later stone pillar bases the fragmentary walls were upstanding to a height of approximately 2&amp;nbsp;m. The western wall fragment had a remains of a double archway – possibly an original entrance into the glass cone.

;The Fritting Floors

Two glass working ‘floor’ structures were identified. The northern structure was constructed of yellow [[refractory]] bricks with single coarse brick walls spaced at regular intervals.  The floor base was vitrified with a thick layer of melted glass covering it. The southern structure appeared to be of a similar construction although was heavily truncated. These structures have been initially interpreted as possible [[frit]]ting (or melting) floors for the primary production of melted glass.

===Pottery Manufacturing Activity===
;Yard Area
A heavily compacted surface of crushed flint covered the eastern area of the site. Several parts of the surface had been repaired by rounded cobbles and obvious areas of wear, including possible cart ruts, were apparent.

;Pottery Buildings
Five buildings associated with pottery manufacture were identified during the excavation including a pottery drying room, workshops and furnaces.  These all appeared to date from the expansion of the pottery works c. 1820.

;The [[Kiln]]s
Six brick built kilns were identified during the course of the excavations. All were fragmentary and truncated by both the modern buildings and later 19th century buildings. All that survived of each was the partial remains of circular structures forming the base of the pottery-firing kiln. A number of rectangular ash pits, evenly spaced along the edges of the main kiln bases, were identified with each kiln. These contained ash and kiln furniture and were used to collect the burnt material falling from the fires above. Surrounding each of the kilns were cobbled floors, which sloped downward to the external edges of the ash pits – to allow easy emptying of the content of the ash pits.

Three kilns were situated within the probable location of the large circular glass cone, built in c. 1777.  Historical reference note that after the glass cone went out of use (c. 1840) a number of small pottery kilns were built within it, reusing the glass cone building to house them.

===The Later Pottery works===
During the final 50 years of production existing buildings were adapted to new functions and new technology. [[Steam power]] was by now incorporated within the factory.

The archaeological evidence for the final phase of Verreville Pottery factory offers glimpses into the complex operations of [[pottery]] manufacturing such as processing, constructing, drying and firing of vessels. Clay would arrive into the area via a short gauge rail line in the warehouse. It would then be mixed by paddles in water (blunging), placed into tanks and put into the slip drying room to evaporate off the water. After this the clay would be thrown (wedged) to remove air bubbles and moulded or slip cast before placing into the pot drying room and finally into the kilns for firing.

Archaeological remains included a slip drying oven, a tunnel furnace and a pot drying room as well as evidence for modifications  to the warehouse, courtyard area and workshop and the removal of the rectangular oven.
