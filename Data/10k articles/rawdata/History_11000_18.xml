'''''A History of the Arab Peoples''''' is a book written by the British-born [[Lebanon|Lebanese]] historian [[Albert Hourani]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hup.harvard.edu/catalog.php?isbn=9780674058194 HUP - Harvard University Press ''A History of the Arab Peoples'' info]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.librarything.com/work/45708/details Librarything data sheet]&lt;/ref&gt;

The book presents the history of the [[Arab]]s from the advent of [[Islam]] (although some [[Pre-Islamic Arabia|pre-Islamic history]] is included) to the late 20th Century. More recent editions contain an [[afterword]] by [[Malise Ruthven]] bringing the history up to the present day including the [[Invasion of Iraq]].

Hourani follows the methodology employed by [[Ibn Khaldun]] in his ''[[Muqaddimah]]'', specifically the reliance on the concept of ''[[asabiyyah]]'' as a means of accounting for dynastic and political changes. Thus, the book involves a considerable amount of [[social history]] as well as [[economic history]] in order to account for the rise and subsequent fall of [[historical powers]] such as the [[Umayyad dynasty|Umayyad]] and [[Ottoman Empire]]s.{{Citation needed|date=March 2007}}

Hourani's specialisation was in intellectual history, and this is also a focus of this work. Considerable rigour is given to explanations of the rise of [[Arab nationalism]], [[Salafism]], [[Ba'athism]] and [[Islamism]].

The book has been translated into [[Arabic language|Arabic]], and the book has found some currency in Arab universities and schools as an introductory text for Arab history. It has also been used as a text for upper-level courses in Arabic as a second language, on account of the highly readable style of Kamal Khouly's translation.

Coins of the [[Achaemenid Empire]] were issued from 520 BCE-450 BCE to 330 BCE. The Persian '''daric''' was the first [[gold coin]] which, along with a similar silver coin, the [[siglos]], (From [[Ancient Greek]] σίγλος, [[Hebrew]] שֶׁקֶל ([[shekel|shékel]])) represented the bimetallic [[monetary standard]] of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Achaemenid Persian Empire]] which has continued till today.&lt;ref name=iranica&gt;Michael Alram, [http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/daric "DARIC"], ''[[Encyclopaedia Iranica]]'', December 15, 1994, last updated November 17, 2011&lt;/ref&gt; It seems that before then, a continuation of Lydian coinage under Persian rule was highly likely. Achaemenid coinage includes the official imperial issues (Darics and Sigloi), as well as coins issued by the Achaemenid governors ([[Satraps]]), such as those stationed in ancient [[Asia Minor]].

When [[Cyrus the Great]] (550–530 BC) came to power, coinage was unfamiliar in his realm. Barter and to some extent silver [[bullion]] was used instead for trade.&lt;ref name="WM"/&gt; The practice of using silver bars for currency also seems to have  been current in [[Central Asia]] from the 6th century.&lt;ref&gt;Discovery of a hoard of currency with silver bars near [[Malayer]], dated circa 600 BCE, with photographs in {{cite book |last1=Bivar |first1=Adrian David Hugh |title=Hoard of Ingot-Currency of the Median Period from Nūsh-i Jān, near Malayir (1971) |pages=97-111 |url=https://archive.org/details/AHoardOfIngot-currencyOfTheMedianPeriodFromNush-iJan1971 |language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cyrus the Great introduced coins to the Persian Empire after 546 BC, following his conquest of [[Lydia]] and the defeat of its king [[Croesus]], who had put in place the first coinage in history.&lt;ref name="WM"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Metcalf |first1=William E. |title=The Oxford Handbook of Greek and Roman Coinage |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199372188 |pages=61-65 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=trkUDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA61 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With his conquest of Lydia, Cyrus acquired a region in which coinage was invented, developped through advanced metallurgy, and had already been in circulation for about 50 years, making the Lydian Kingdom one of the leading trade powers of the time.&lt;ref name="WM"/&gt; 

It seems Cyrus initially adopted the Lydian coinage as such, and continued to strike Lydia's lion-and-bull coinage.&lt;ref name="WM"/&gt; The [[stater]] coins had a weight of 10.7 grams, a standard initially created by [[Croesus]], which was then adopted by the Persians and became commonly known as the "Persic standard".&lt;ref name="AJN55"/&gt; The Persians also minted postumous Croeseid half-staters, with a weight of 5.35g, which would become the weight standard for the later Sigloi, introduced at the end of the 6th century BCE.&lt;ref name="AJN55"&gt;{{cite book |title=American Journal of Numismatics (Second Series), vol. 20 |date=2008 |page=55 |url=https://archive.org/details/AJNSecond2008Vols20to20/page/n65}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Cahill |first1=Nick |last2=Kroll |first2=John H |title=New archaic coin finds at Sardis, AJA 109 (2005). |date=2005 |journal=American Journal of Archaeology (Vol 109, No.4) |pages=609-614 |url=https://www.academia.edu/2465277/New_archaic_coin_finds_at_Sardis_AJA_109_2005_ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Soon after 546, Cyrus also had full control of [[Asia Minor]], including other kingdoms such [[Lycia]], [[Caria]] or [[Ionia]], following the conquests of his general [[Harpagus]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Christidēs |first1=A.-Ph |last2=Christidis |first2=A.-F. |last3=Arapopoulou |first3=Maria |last4=Χρίτη |first4=Μαρία |title=A History of Ancient Greek: From the Beginnings to Late Antiquity |date=2007 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521833073 |page=924 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WJbd0m6YaFkC&amp;pg=PA924 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the conquest of Lydia and the adoption of Lydian coinage, the nascent Achaemenid Empire thus obtained access to the most modern coinage of its time and the economic power that goes with it.&lt;ref name="WM63"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Metcalf |first1=William E. |title=The Oxford Handbook of Greek and Roman Coinage |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199372188 |page=63-64 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=trkUDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mint was located in [[Sardis]], now capital of all the Western Satrapies of the Achaemenid Empire, and continued minted operation under Cyrus.&lt;ref name="WM63"/&gt; This coinage would supply the western part of the Achaemenid Empire.&lt;ref name="WM63"/&gt;

Technically, these early coins used [[incuse]] punches on the reverse, while the obverse die would consist in some pictorial design ("die and punch" technique, rather than the later "two dies" technique).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Dow |first1=Joseph A. |title=Ancient Coins Through the Bible |date=2011 |publisher=Tate Publishing |isbn=9781617771354 |page=83 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZvYnpejBVy0C&amp;pg=PA83 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Lydian coins used double punches on the reserve, a technique which would be simplified in the time of Darius by using a single reverse punch on some coinage.&lt;ref name="WM63"/&gt; Some of the earliest Lycian coins under the Achaemenids also used an animal design on the obverse and incuse punches on the reverse, which developed into geometrical forms, such as two diagonals between projecting rectangular lugs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Carradice |first1=Ian |title=Coinage and administration in the Athenian and Persian empires: the Ninth Oxford Symposium on Coinage and Monetary History |date=1987 |publisher=B.A.R. |page=32 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-n4aAAAAYAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;ref&gt;"on the reverse an incuse punch which develops into a distinctive local form incorporating two diagonals between projecting rectangular lugs" in {{cite book |last1=Kraay |first1=Colin M. |title=Archaic and classical Greek coins |date=1976 |publisher=Methuen |isbn=9780416123104 |page=269 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SlNmAAAAMAAJ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As late as the time of the foundation of the [[Apadana Palace]] in [[Persepolis]], circa 515 BCE, it seems that the Achaemenid had not yet designed the Sigloi and Darics. This is known because no Darics or Sigloi were found in the [[Apadana hoard]], under the [[Apadana]] foundation stones of the [[Apadana Palace]] in [[Persepolis]] (dated to between 519 and 510 BC), whereas the hoard contained several gold Croeseids of the light type from [[Sardis]] (probably minted under the rule of Darius I) and several imported Archaic Greek silver staters.&lt;ref name="EI"/&gt;

==Darics and Sigloi==

{{essay-like |section|date=November 2018|reason=The earlier write-up were encyclopaedic, this is now entirely rambling}}
The coinage of the Achaemenid Empire started to move away from simply copying Lydian coinage to introducing changes with the reign of [[Darius I]] (ruled 522-486 BC).&lt;ref name="WM63"/&gt; Under Darius I, the minting of [[Croeseid]]s in [[Sardis]] was progressively replaced by the minting of Darics and Sigloi. From around 510-500 BC,&lt;ref name="WM63"/&gt; Darius simplified the coining procedure by replacing the double reverse punch of Lydian coins, by a single, oblong reverse punch, and he introduced the image of the Persian king in place of the lion and bull design.&lt;ref name="WM63"/&gt; This is known because no Darics or Sigloi were found in the [[Apadana hoard]], under the [[Apadana]] foundation stones of the [[Apadana Palace]] in [[Persepolis]] (dated to between 519 and 510 BC), whereas there were gold Croeseids of the light type and Greek silver staters.&lt;ref name="EI"&gt;{{cite book |title=Daric|url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/daric}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, a clay tablet, issued in year 22 of the reign of Darius I (circa 500 BCE), contained the impression on clay of two Type II Sigloi ("King shooting arrow"), showing that the new Sigloi had already been issued by 500 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |page=14, with photograph|title=Half-figure of the King: unravelling the mysteries of the earliest Sigloi of Darius I|journal=The Celator Vol.26 No.02 Feb 2012|url=https://community.vcoins.com/thecelator/The-Celator-Vol.26-No.02-Feb-2012.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Root |first1=Margaret Cool |title=The Persian archer at Persepolis : aspects of chronology, style and symbolism |date=1989 |pages=36-37 |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/rea_0035-2004_1989_num_91_1_4361 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of these and other discoveries, the creation of the Darics and Sigloi is dated to the last decade of the 6th century BC, during the reign of [[Darius I]].&lt;ref name="EI"/&gt; 

The new Achaemenid coins were initially only made in silver, and the Lydian gold design of Croesus was maintained.&lt;ref name="WM63"/&gt; Then, Darius introduced his new design for gold coins as well, which came to be known as Darics, from [[Old Persian]] ''Daruiyaka'', meaning "Golden".&lt;ref name="WM63"/&gt; Although the Achaemenids had developed their own currency, they still accepted local monetary production including civic issues, throughout the land under their control, in particular in Western Asia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mildenberg |first1=Leo |title=On the so-called satrapal coinage |date=2000 |page=10 |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/anatv_1013-9559_2000_act_12_1_950 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the Achaemenids fully exploited and developed coinage production from Western Asia, it seems the barter economy remained quite important in the Iranian heartland throughout the Achaemenid period, and the Achaemenids did not develop their own mints in Iran: minting coinage in Iran would only start later from circa 330 BCE under [[Alexander the Great]] and the [[Seleucid Empire]].&lt;ref name="WM63"/&gt; The circulation of the Daric was mainly confined to the Western part of the Achaemenid Empire.&lt;ref name="WM63"/&gt; 

It seems that all the minting activity for the Darics and the Sigloi for the whole Empire was essentially centralized in one mint, or possibly two mints at [[Sardis]] in [[Lycia]].&lt;ref name="WM68"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Metcalf |first1=William E. |title=The Oxford Handbook of Greek and Roman Coinage |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199372188 |pages=68-71 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=trkUDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA68 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sardis remained the central mint for the Persian Darics and Sigloi of Achaemenid coinage, and there is no evidence of other mints for the new Achaemenid coins during the whole time of the Achaemenid Empire.&lt;ref name="CHI619"&gt; {{cite book |last1=Fisher |first1=William Bayne |last2=Gershevitch |first2=I. |last3=Boyle |first3=John Andrew |last4=Yarshater |first4=Ehsan |last5=Frye |first5=Richard Nelson |title=The Cambridge History of Iran |date=1968 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |isbn=9780521200912 |page=619 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BBbyr932QdYC&amp;pg=PA619 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to hoard finds, Sardis was clearly the main mint, but there may also have been secondary mints in southwestern and northwestern [[Asia Minor]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.iranicaonline.org/articles/daric|title=Daric}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

Overall, it seems that the minting of Darics and Sigloi was rather small in quantity compared to the other local productions of coins in Asia Minor, or the circulation of Greek coins in the area.&lt;ref name="WM70"/&gt; Although the gold Daric became an international currency which was found throughout the Ancient world, the circulation of the silver Sigloi remained very much limited to Asia Minor: important hoards of Sigloi are only found in these areas, and finds of Sigloi beyond are always very limited and marginal compared to Greek coins, even in Achaemenid territories.&lt;ref name="CHI619"/&gt;

According to numismat [[Martin Price]], there is no doubt that the Darics and Sigloi of Types I and II were minted at [[Sardis]] and immediately followed the production of the [[Croeseid]]s, since they adopted similar weights and were of the same fabric.&lt;ref name="MP"&gt;Martin Price "Intervention" in {{cite book |last1=Root |first1=Margaret Cool |title=The Persian archer at Persepolis : aspects of chronology, style and symbolism |date=1989 |pages=50 |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/rea_0035-2004_1989_num_91_1_4361 |language=fr-FR}}&lt;/ref&gt; He insists that the finds of the Croeseids and the "Archer" types of Darics and Sigloi indicate that they were not an Imperial coinage, but rather the coinage of the Satrapy of Lydia.&lt;ref name="MP"/&gt;

The Siglos was 5.40-5.60 grams each, based on the 0.5 Lydian Siglos of 10.73-10.92 grams for the full unit. Purity was at first issue 97-98% but by the middle 4th century was 94-95%. 1 Siglos = 7.5 Attic [[Obolus|Obols]].

;Extent
[[File:Stater of Philip II of Macedon.jpg|thumb|The gold Stater of [[Philip II of Macedon]] (ruled 359–336 BC) was the first true competition for the Achaemenid Daric. It was called ''Dareikos Philippeios'' ("Philip's Daric") by the Greeks]]
In effect, the gold Daric became a currency desired in all the ancient world, since it was the most convenient format to exchange and accumulate wealth.&lt;ref name="WM68"/&gt; The Greeks never minted much gold, but their silver Athenian [[tetradrachm]]s also became a sort of world currency from the 5th century BC.&lt;ref name="WM68"/&gt; The first important competition against the prestigious Daric, as a means of storing wealth and making large payments on an international scale, came later from [[Philip II of Macedon]] (ruled 359–336 BC), when he issued his own gold coinage, pointedly called ''Dareikos Philippeios'' by the Greeks.&lt;ref name="WM68"/&gt;

;Archaeological finds
[[Daric]] coins have been found in [[Asia Minor]], [[Ancient Greece|Greece]], [[Macedonia (region)|Macedonia]] and [[Italy]]. The Siglos denomination have been found in hoards only in Asia Minor, and single coins with other Greek coinage from [[Ancient Egypt]] to [[Afghanistan]] ([[Kabul hoard]]) and [[Pakistan]] ([[Shaikhan Dehri hoard]]).&lt;ref name="WM68"/&gt;

In all the known hoards of the Achaemenid period, royal Achaemenid coinage, such as the sigloi, form actually a small minority, while most of the non-local coinage generally comes from the Greek realm, either from the independent Greek mainland or from the Greek colonies of Western Asia under the Achaemenid rule.{{sfn|Kagan, Archaic Greek Coins East of the Tigris|2009|pp=230-231}} For example the [[Kabul hoard]], in modern day [[Afghanistan]], included 30 coins from various Greek cities, about 33 [[Athenian coinage|Athenian coins]] and an Iranian imitation of an Athenian coin, only 9 royal Achaemenid silver coins (sigloi). There were also 29 locally minted coins and 14 [[punch-marked coins]] in the shape of bent bars.{{sfn|Bopearachchi, Coin Production and Circulation|2000|pages=300-301}}&lt;ref name="Cribb Iranian imitation"&gt;{{harvnb|Cribb, Dating India's Earliest Coins|1985|p=548}}: "The Iranian imitations were close copies of silver tetradrachms of Athens; the latest Greek coin of the Chaman Hazuri hoard is an example of these Iranian copies of an Athenian coin."&lt;/ref&gt; 

Some Achaemenid Satraps are also known to have minted coins in imitation of Athenian coinage, such as the Achaemenid Satrap of Egypt [[Sabakes]] (ruled circa 340-333 BCE). An Achaemenid copy of an Athenian coin, this time found in the [[Kabul hoard]] was minted in the vicinity of [[Babylon]] circa 380 BCE. 

The fact that Greek coins (both [[Archaic Greece|Archaic]] and early Classical) are comparatively numerous in Achaemenid period coin hoards, much more numerous than sigloi, suggests that the circulation of Greek coinage was central in the monetary system of the Empire.&lt;ref name="JK230"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Kagan |first1=Jonathan |title=Archaic Greek coins East of the Tigris|page=230-234 |url=https://www.academia.edu/1294681/ARCHAIC_GREEK_COINS_EAST_OF_THE_TIGRIS_ |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; These coins were probably not legal tenders in the Achaemenid Empire, but were valued for their weight in silver, and thus used as [[bullion]] silver. Numerous finds of [[hacksilber]] hoards in the East also exist from the period, in which various silver objects, including coins, are cut into pieces, in order to facilitate their exchange on the basis of their weight.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.cngcoins.com/Coin.aspx?CoinID=265591 Classical Numismatic Group]&lt;/ref&gt;

Greek coinage travelled throughout the Achaemenid Empire. For example, the Greek coins discovered in the [[Kabul hoard]] include the following types:

During the 4th century, following the weakening of central Achaemenid power, and the development of coinage technologies, Siglos production receded and numerous satrapal issues of a very high quality started to appear in Western Asia under the Achaemenid Empire.&lt;ref name="WM70"/&gt; These issues combined Achaemenid as well as Greek characteristics. Throughout, coin circulation was characterized by a mix of coins from the Achaemenid and Greek realms.&lt;ref name="WM70"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Metcalf |first1=William E. |title=The Oxford Handbook of Greek and Roman Coinage |date=2016 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=9780199372188 |pages=70-80 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=trkUDAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA63 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various Achaemenid satraps also issued imitations of Athenian tetradrachms, such as [[Sabakes]] in [[Egypt]].

;First attempts at portraiture

After his conquest of the [[Achaemenid Empire]], [[Alexander the Great]] established his own satraps in the conquered territories, some of them Achaemenids who had been favorable to the invader, such as [[Mazaios]], others some of Alexander's closest supports, such as [[Balacrus]]. Several satraps continued to use an Achaemenid type for their coinage, such as [[Balacrus]] when he became Hellenistic satrap of [[Cilicia]], complete with the local deety of Tarsus, [[Baal]].&lt;ref name=LM&gt;{{cite book |last1=Mildenberg |first1=Leo |title=On the so-called satrapal coinage |date=2000 |page=10 and Note 8 |url=https://www.persee.fr/doc/anatv_1013-9559_2000_act_12_1_950 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This coinage is said to have later influenced Alexander's imperial coinage, which was often minted in the same mints.&lt;ref name=LM/&gt;

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Dani was born on 20 June 1920 in [[Basna]], [[Central Provinces]], India,&lt;ref name="khan"&gt;Khan, M.N. [http://www.salaam.co.uk/knowledge/biography/viewentry.php?id=3326 Biographical Data]. ''Salaam''. Retrieved on 15 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; descending "from a family of [[Kashmiris|Kashmiri]] traders carrying the lineage name [[Wani (surname)|Wain]]."&lt;ref&gt;Anis Dani, "The making of the man" in ''Pakistan Archaeology'', n. 26 (1991), vol. I, p. 3&lt;/ref&gt; He graduated in 1944, with an [[Master of Arts|MA]] degree, to become the first Muslim graduate of [[Banaras Hindu University]]. He scored highest marks in the exams which earned him a Gold Medal. This also qualified him for a teaching fellowship from the same university. Although he was provided with the grant, he was not allowed to teach due to his religious beliefs.&lt;ref name="farah" /&gt; He stayed there for six months. In 1945, he started working as a trainee in archaeology under the guidance of [[Mortimer Wheeler]]. At this time, he participated in excavations at [[Taxila]] and [[Mohenjo-daro]]. He was subsequently posted at the Department of Archaeology of British India at [[Taj Mahal]], [[Agra]]. He received his PhD from the [[UCL Institute of Archaeology|Institute of Archaeology]], [[University College London]].

=== Career ===
After the [[Partition of India]], Dani migrated to [[East Pakistan]]. There, in 1947–49 he worked as Assistant Superintendent of the Department of Archaeology. At this time, he renovated the Verandra Museum at [[Rajshahi]]. In 1949, he married Safiya Sultana. Together, they had three sons (Anis, Navaid and Junaid) and a daughter (Fauzia).

Dani remained engaged in excavation works on the pre-[[Indus Valley Civilization|Indus Civilization]] site of [[Rehman Dheri]] in [[Northern Pakistan]].&lt;ref name="khano"&gt;Khan, O (1998). [http://www.harappa.com/script/danitext.html An interview with Dani] in Islamabad, on 6 January. Retrieved on 15 May 2008&lt;/ref&gt; He also made a number of discoveries of [[Gandhara]] sites in the [[Peshawar]] and [[Swat Valley]]s, and worked on Indo-Greek sites in [[Lower Dir|Dir]].&lt;ref&gt;Iqbal, M.

Retrieved on 6 March 2007&lt;/ref&gt; From 1980, he was involved in research focusing on the documentation of the rock carvings and inscriptions on ancient remains from the [[Neolithic]] age up to the late Buddhist period in the high mountain region of Northern Pakistan along with Karl Jettmar, Volker Thewalt and (much later, since 1989) Harald Hauptmann of the Heidelberg Academy of Sciences, [[University of Heidelberg]].&lt;ref&gt;Shahid, J. (2006). [http://www.dawn.com/2006/12/05/nat11.htm Dam threatens ancient remains], Dawn, 5 December. Retrieved on 6 March 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;
In 1990–91, he led the [[UNESCO]] international scientific teams for the Desert Route Expedition of the [[Silk Road]] in China and the Steppe Route Expedition of the [[Cities along the Silk Road|Silk Road]] in the [[Soviet Union]].

From his extensive fieldwork and research experience, Dani refuted any influence of [[South India]]n culture on the Indus Valley Civilization.&lt;ref name="khano" /&gt; Using a geographic perspective of the socio-political systems and cultural distribution of the [[Indus River|Indus Basin]] and surrounding hinterland, he observed that the [[Indo-Gangetic Plain]] did not play any significant role in the development of Indus Valley culture.&lt;ref&gt;Dani, A.H. (1975). [http://www.penn.museum/documents/publications/expedition/PDFs/17-2/Dani.pdf Origins of Bronze Age Cultures in the Indus Basin – a geographic perspective]. ''Expedition''. Retrieved on 4 November 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Nor was there any invasion from the seaside during the [[Bronze Age]], although the coastline facilitated maritime trade. The major influence, according to Dani, came from Central Asia in the west. He asserted that the hilly western borderland that appears as a boundary to the external eye is actually a network of hill plateaus where the local people have always moved freely. He therefore argued that the [[Culture of Pakistan|cultural history of Pakistan]] is more closely related to Central Asia through Buddhist, [[Persia]]n and later [[Sufism|Sufi]] influences.&lt;ref name="joffe" /&gt; He strove to revive this relationship by promoting organisations such as the Pak-Central Asia Friendship Association.

Dani maintained that despite the [[Arabian Sea]] allowing the [[Meluhha]]ns to establish trade relations with [[Mesopotamia]] and [[Ancient Egypt]], the majority of historical movements occurred between Central and South Asia. The geographic location as a link between the two regions has characterised the relationship "between the people of Pakistan and those of Central Asia in the field of culture, language, literature, food, dress, furniture and folklore".&lt;ref&gt;Dani, A.H.

'''Anders Sørensen Vedel''' (9 November 1542 – 13 February 1616)&lt;ref name="kalliope"&gt;[http://www.kalliope.org/biografi.cgi?fhandle=vedel Anders Sørensen Vedel - Biografi] at Kalliope.org&lt;/ref&gt; was a [[Denmark|Danish]] [[priest]] and [[historian]]. He translated the ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' by [[Saxo Grammaticus]] into Danish in 1575, and published the influential "''Hundredvisebogen''" in 1591.

==Biography==
Anders Sørensen was born in [[Vejle]], from which place the Vedel name comes.&lt;ref name="bricka"&gt;[[Carl Frederik Bricka]], ''Dansk Biografisk Lexikon'', vol. XVIII [Ubbe - Wimpffen], 1904, pp.292-301 [http://runeberg.org/dbl/18/0294.html Available online]&lt;/ref&gt; 14 years old he moved to study in [[Ribe]], and after finishing his education he moved on to [[Copenhagen University]] in 1561.&lt;ref name="bricka"/&gt; In 1562, he was the tutor of astronomer [[Tycho Brahe]] on Brahe's Grand Tour in [[Europe]],&lt;ref name="kalliope"/&gt; forming a lasting bond of friendship with him.&lt;ref name="bricka"/&gt; Vedel started studying at [[Wittenberg]] in 1565,&lt;ref name="kalliope"/&gt; which he finished in 1566, and was appointed priest at [[Copenhagen Castle]] in 1568.&lt;ref name="gyldendal"&gt;[http://www.denstoredanske.dk/Danmarks_geografi_og_historie/Danmarks_historie/Danske_historikere/Anders_S%C3%B8rensen_Vedel Anders Sørensen Vedel] at Gyldendals Encyklopædi&lt;/ref&gt; Vedel's historical knowledge was admired by leading politicians including [[Christoffer Valkendorf]],
[[Bjørn Andersen (politician)|Bjørn Andersen]], [[Arild Huitfeldt]], [[Johan Friis]] and [[Peder Oxe]], and he was seen as the right man to continue [[Christiern Pedersen]]'s [[Danish language]] translation of the [[Latin language|Latin]] chronicle ''[[Gesta Danorum]]'' by [[Saxo Grammaticus]].&lt;ref name="bricka"/&gt;

He started translation in 1570, and the finished work "''Den danske Krønicke''" was published in 1575.&lt;ref name="kalliope"/&gt; The work was both a translation and rewriting of the original Latin phrases.&lt;ref name="bricka"/&gt; While working on the translation, he was given the income of a [[Canon (priest)|''canon'']] at [[Ribe Cathedral]] in 1573.&lt;ref name="kalliope"/&gt; After pressure from Peder Oxe, [[Niels Kaas]], and {{Interlanguage link multi|Jørgen Rosenkrantz|dk|3=Jørgen Ottesen Rosenkrantz (1523-1596)}},&lt;ref name="bricka"/&gt; Vedel wrote a proposal for a Latin continuation of Saxo's work in 1578 which was finalized in 1581.&lt;ref name="gyldendal"/&gt; He was relieved of his priesthood in Copenhagen, and moved to Ribe in 1581.&lt;ref name="bricka"/&gt;

He was appointed Royal [[historian]] in 1584 and received a [[Prelate|prelature]] at Ribe to support himself,&lt;ref name="bricka"/&gt; and undertook the task of continuing the Danish chronicle in that year.&lt;ref name="nomos"&gt;[http://www.nomos-dk.dk/skraep/ASVedel-bio.htm Anders Sørensen Vedel - (1542-1616)] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100305163022/http://www.nomos-dk.dk/skraep/ASVedel-bio.htm |date=March 5, 2010 }} at NOMOS-DK.dk&lt;/ref&gt; However, he overreached himself in his attempt to do so. He planned an ambitious work in twenty-two books dealing with both [[language]]&lt;ref&gt;Marita Akhøj Nielsen (2004): Anders Sørensen Vedels filologiske arbejder, bd. 1-2, 820 sider, UJDS nr. 562, C.A. Reitzels Forlag, {{ISBN|87-7876-378-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[topography]] as well as with history.&lt;ref name="bricka"/&gt; However other tasks, lack of help from secretaries,&lt;ref name="bricka"/&gt; his own slowness and carefulness—and perhaps also a general underestimation of the demands of this work—led to very modest results. In 1594, after the death of chancellor Niels Kaas,&lt;ref name="bricka"/&gt; the task was given to [[Niels Krag]],&lt;ref name="nomos"/&gt; under Vedel's protestations.&lt;ref name="bricka"/&gt; He got a one-year reprieve, but could not produce satisfactory results, after which he turned his work over to Niels Krag.&lt;ref name="bricka"/&gt; Much of what he had written was lost at the [[Copenhagen Fire of 1728|fire of Copenhagen in 1728]].

One spin-off from this task which survived was his "''Hundredvisebogen''" (1591) of a hundred Danish [[ballads]] which became a solid foundation of later knowledge of the older Danish literary tradition.&lt;ref name="gyldendal"/&gt; It was published with the support of [[Sophie of Mecklenburg-Güstrow|Queen Sophie]].&lt;ref name="nomos"/&gt; Vedel's one hundred songs were republished by [[Peder Syv]] in 1695, as half of his collection of 200 folksongs. Vedel's own re-creation of some of the ballads shows his ability as a poet. In the [[Faroe Islands]], texts from "''Hundredvisebogen''" have been in use among folk singers right up until today.&lt;ref&gt;[[Marianne Clausen]] (2010): Vísuløg í Føroyum / Danish folk ballads in the Faroes, 506 pp, UJDS nr. 573, Stiðin&lt;/ref&gt;

Vedel died on 13 February 1616 in Ribe.

The '''Austrian Civil War''' ({{lang-de|Österreichischer Bürgerkrieg}}), also known as the '''February Uprising''' ({{lang-de|Februarkämpfe}}), is a term sometimes used for a few days of skirmishes between Nationalist and Marxist forces between 12 February and 16 February 1934, in [[Austria]]. The clashes started in [[Linz]] and took place principally in the cities of [[Vienna]], [[Graz]], [[Bruck an der Mur]], [[Judenburg]], [[Wiener Neustadt]] and [[Steyr]], but also in some other industrial cities of eastern and central Austria.

== Origins of the conflict ==

{{History of Austria}}

After the disintegration of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]] (following the [[First World War]]), the [[German Austria|state of Austria]] — largely comprising the [[German language|German-speaking]] parts of the former empire — became constituted as a [[parliamentary democracy]]. Two major factions dominated politics in the new nation: [[Socialism|socialists]] (represented politically by the [[Social Democratic Party of Austria|Social Democratic Workers' Party]]) and [[Conservatism|conservatives]] (politically represented by the [[Christian Social Party (Austria)|Christian Social Party]]). The socialists found their strongholds in the working class districts of the cities, while the conservatives could build on the support of the rural population and of most of the upper classes. The conservatives also maintained close alliances with the [[Roman Catholic Church]], and could count among their ranks some leading clerics.

As in most of the nascent [[Europe]]an democracies of the time, politics in Austria took on a highly ideological flavour. Both the socialist and the conservative camp did not merely consist of political parties, but possessed far-ranging power structures, including their own [[paramilitary]] forces. The conservatives began organising the ''[[Heimwehr]]'' ({{lang-de|Homeguard}}) in 1921–23; in response, the Social Democrats organised paramilitaries called the ''[[Republikanischer Schutzbund]]'' ({{lang-de|Republican Protection Association}}) after 1923. Altercations and clashes between these forces (at political rallies, etc.) occurred frequently.

A first major incident ensued early in 1927, when members of [[Hermann Hiltl]]'s ''Frontkämpfervereinigung'' ("Front Fighters Union" — a paramilitary association likewise affiliated with the conservative camp) shot and killed an eight-year-old boy and a war veteran marching with the Schutzbund in a counter-demonstration in [[Schattendorf]] ([[Burgenland]]).{{Citation needed|date=October 2016}} In July, three defendants in the case were acquitted, which led to outrage in the left-wing camp. On 15 July 1927, a [[July Revolt of 1927|general strike]] occurred, and demonstrations took place in the capital. After the storming of a police station, security forces started shooting at demonstrators. An angry group of people then set fire to the Palace of Justice (''[[Palace of Justice (Vienna)|Justizpalast]]''), seen as a symbol of a flawed and partial judicial system. Altogether, 89 people (85 of them demonstrators) lost their lives in this [[July Revolt of 1927|July revolt]], and many hundreds suffered injury. Surprisingly, the violence soon died down and the factions took their battle from the streets back into the political institutions.

However, the travails of the [[Austrian First Republic|First Republic]] only got worse in the following years. The [[Great Depression]] also showed its effects in Austria, resulting in high unemployment and massive inflation. In addition, from 1933 — the year [[Adolf Hitler]] became Chancellor of [[Germany]] — [[Nazism|National Socialist]] sympathisers (who wanted a [[German question#Later influence|unification of Austria with Hitler's Germany]]) threatened the Austrian state from within.

== Conflict ==

On 4 March 1933, Christian Social [[Chancellor of Austria|Chancellor]] [[Engelbert Dollfuß]] [[Self-elimination of Parliament|suspended the Austrian Parliament]]. In a close vote (on railway workers' wages) in the [[National Council of Austria|National Council]], each of the three presidents of parliament resigned their position in order to cast a ballot, leaving nobody to preside over the meeting. Even though the [[By-law|bylaws]] could have resolved this situation, Dollfuss used this opportunity to declare that parliament had ceased to function, and blocked all attempts to reconvene it. The Social Democratic Party had thus lost its major platform for political action. The conservatives, facing pressure and violence not only from the left but also from Nazis infiltrating from Germany, could now rule by decree on the basis of a 1917 emergency law, without checks on their power, and began to suspend civil liberties. They banned the Schutzbund and imprisoned many of its members.

[[File:Bundesarchiv Bild 102-00329, Wien, Februarkämpfe, Bundesheer.jpg|thumb|left|February fights: Federal Army soldiers take position in front of the [[Vienna State Opera]]]]

On 12 February 1934, a force, led by [[Heimwehr]] commander in [[Vienna]] Emil Fey, searched Hotel Schiff in [[Linz]], a property belonging to the Social Democratic Party. Linz Schutzbund commander Richard Bernaschek was the first to actively resist, sparking off armed conflict between a conglomeration of the Heimwehr, the police, the gendarmerie and the regular Federal Army against the outlawed, but still existent, socialist [[Republikanischer Schutzbund|Schutzbund]].&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 280–81.&lt;/ref&gt; Skirmishes between the two camps spread to other cities and towns in Austria, with the heat of the action occurring in [[Vienna]]. There, members of the Schutzbund barricaded themselves in city council housing estates ([[Gemeindebauten]]), the symbols and strongholds for the socialist movement in Austria, such as [[Karl-Marx-Hof]]. Police and paramilitaries took up positions outside these fortified complexes and the parties exchanged fire, initially only with small arms. Fighting also occurred in industrial towns such as [[Steyr]], [[Sankt Pölten]], [[Weiz]], [[Eggenberg (Graz)]], [[Kapfenberg]], [[Bruck an der Mur]], [[Graz]], [[Ebensee]] and [[Wörgl]].

An apparently decisive moment in the events came with the entry of the Austrian armed forces into the conflict. Though the army remained still a comparatively independent institution, chancellor Dollfuss ordered Karl-Marx-Hof shelled with [[light artillery]], endangering the lives of thousands of civilians and destroying many flats before forcing the socialist fighters to surrender.&lt;ref&gt;Reppe 79.&lt;/ref&gt;
The fighting ended in Vienna and [[Upper Austria]]n  by 13 February, but continued heavily in Styrian cities, especially in [[Bruck an der Mur]] and [[Judenburg]], until 14 or 15 February. After that, there were only small groups of socialists fighting against the armed forces, or fleeing from them. By 16 February 1934, the Austrian Civil War had ended.

== Fallout ==
[[File:Linz, Hafen - Gedenkstein für Hans Preiner 1934.jpg|thumb|right|Memorial stone for a police officer killed on 12 February 1934 in [[Linz]] during the war]]Several hundred people (including paramilitaries, members of the security forces and civilians) died in the armed conflict; more than a thousand suffered wounds. The authorities tried and executed nine Schutzbund leaders under the provisions of martial law. In addition, over 1,500 arrests were made. Leading socialist politicians, such as [[Otto Bauer]], were forced into exile.&lt;ref&gt;Brook-Shepherd 283.&lt;/ref&gt; [[John Gunther]] reported that Schutzbund members received "mercilessly severe" sentences.&lt;ref name="gunther1940"&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://archive.org/stream/in.ernet.dli.2015.149663/2015.149663.Inside-Europe#page/n437/mode/2up |title=Inside Europe |last=Gunther |first=John|location=New York|authorlink=John Gunther|publisher=Harper &amp; Brothers |year=1940 |page=416}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The incidents of February 1934 were taken as a pretext by the government to prohibit the Social Democratic Party and its affiliated [[trade unions]] altogether. In May, the conservatives replaced the democratic constitution by a [[corporatist]] constitution modelled along the lines of [[Benito Mussolini]]'s fascist [[Italy]]; therefore the socialists coined the term '[[Austrofascism]]' although the underlying ideology was essentially that of the most conservative elements in the Austrian Catholic [[clergy]], a feature inconsistent with both [[Italian Fascism]] and [[Nazism]]. The [[Patriotic Front (Austria)|Patriotic Front]] (''Vaterländische Front''), into which the Heimwehr and the Christian Social Party were merged, became the only legal political party in the resulting [[authoritarian]] regime, the ''[[Ständestaat]]''.

== Long-term effects ==
[[File:Buergerkriegsdenkmal Linz.JPG|thumb|right|Memorial to the victims and fighters at the place where the civil war started, in the courtyard of the Hotel Schiff in Linz.]]

Though small in scale in an international comparison (and small in scale indeed in the light of the events of the [[Second World War]] which soon followed), the Austrian Civil War nevertheless proved a decisive moment in the history of the Republic. After the Second World War, when Austria re-emerged on the political landscape as a sovereign nation, politics again fell under the domination of the Social Democrats and the conservatives, who now formed a party called the [[Austrian People's Party]] (ÖVP). However, so as to avoid a repeat of the bitter divisions of the First Republic, the leaders of the Second Republic were determined to put the idea of broad consensus at the heart of the new political system. The concept of the 'Grand Coalition' was introduced, in which the two major parties (Social Democrats and People's Party) shared in the government and avoided open confrontation. This system brought with it stability and continuity, but ultimately led to other political repercussions (also see ''[[Proporz]]''). But the events of the Austrian Civil War had persuaded many in the political establishment (and, indeed, the population at large) that a slow pace of political reform was a small price to pay for social calm.

Austrian political parties often stand accused of having done little to come to terms with the past. Even at the beginning of the 21st century, Austria's society bears the clear marks of division into the "red" (socialist) and "black" (conservative) areas of influence that trace back to the time of the First Republic and its civil war. This continues to cause extensive parallelisation even where ideology rarely plays a role, such as in first aid services, automotive organisations and science. {{Citation needed|date=June 2015}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2778">'''The Bourne Stone''' is an archaeological curiosity located in the town of [[Bourne, Massachusetts|Bourne]], [[Massachusetts]]. The stone is a 300-pound chunk of [[granite]], upon which two lines of [[carvings]] were made. 

== History ==

According to the [[Archaeological Institute of America]], the stone probably started as a doorstep of a Native American meeting house around 1680, then passed through several owners, landing at the [[Aptucxet Trading Post]] in Bourne about 1930.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.archaeological.org/events/20295|title=AIA Event Listings - The Bourne Stone - Bourne Historical Society|website=www.archaeological.org|accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; The stone has been displayed at the historical center since 2003.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.capecodtimes.com/article/20101020/news/10200327|title=Bourne Stone continues to baffle the experts|website=capecodtimes.com|accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Barry Fell]] claimed in his 1977 book - ''America B.C.: Ancient Settlers in the New World'' - that the markings are in an [[Iberian script]] and language which he translates to "A proclamation of annexation. By this Hanno takes possession".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ejLkBQAAQBAJ|title=Ancient Stone Sites of New England and the Debate Over Early European Exploration|last=Goudsward|first=David|date=2006-07-05|publisher=McFarland|isbn=9780786424627}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, Larry J. Zimmerman explained his own theory about the Bourne Stone in ''Collaboration In Archaeological Practice: Engaging Descendant Communities.'' He invited Norse runic expert Michael Barnes&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wickedyankee.blogspot.com/2012/10/the-bourne-stone-bourne-ma.html|title=Wicked Yankee: The Bourne Stone - Bourne, Ma|last=Yankee|first=Wicked|date=2012-10-31|website=Wicked Yankee|accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; to examine the stone.  Barnes stated that the markings were definitely not runic. Zimmerman and Patricia Emerson, Minnesota archaeologist, suggested that the markings looked like [[Native Americans in the United States|Native American]] [[petroglyphs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=30tgziT2erIC&amp;pg=PA70&amp;dq=Bourne+stone+barry+fell#v=onepage&amp;q=Bourne%20stone%20barry%20fell&amp;f=false|title=Collaboration in archaeological practice: engaging descendant communities|publisher=Altamira Press|year=2007|isbn=978-0-7591-1054-0|page=70|author=Larry J.

{{nihongo|'''''Bun'an'''''|文安}} was a {{nihongo|[[Japanese era name]]|年号,| ''nengō'',| lit. "year name"}} after ''[[Kakitsu]]'' and before ''[[Hotoku]].''  This period spanned the years from February 1444 through July 1449.&lt;ref&gt;Nussbaum, Louis-Frédéric. (2005). "''Bun'an''" in [https://books.google.com/books?id=p2QnPijAEmEC&amp;pg=PA89&amp;dq=  ''Japan encyclopedia'', p. 89;] n.b., Louis-Frédéric is pseudonym of Louis-Frédéric Nussbaum, ''see'' [https://archive.is/20120524174828/http://dispatch.opac.ddb.de/DB=4.1/PPN?PPN=128842709 Deutsche Nationalbibliothek Authority File].&lt;/ref&gt;  The reigning emperor was {{nihongo|[[Emperor Go-Hanazono of Japan|Go-Hanazono]]''-tennō''|後花園天皇}}.&lt;ref&gt;Titsingh, Isaac. (1834). [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA331,M1  ''Annales des empereurs du Japon'', pp. 331]-345.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Change of era==
* '''1444''' {{nihongo|''Bun'an gannen''|文安元年}}: The era name was changed to mark an event or a number of events. The previous era ended and a new one commenced in ''Kakitsu'' 4.

==Events of the ''Bun'an'' era==
* '''1444''' (''Bun'an 1, 1st month''): [[Ashikaga Yoshimasa|Yoshinari]]&lt;ref&gt;Yoshinari will change his name in ''[[Kyōtoku]]'' 2 (1453); and he will be more conventionally known in history as "Yoshimasa" &amp;ndash; but at this point, that is not yet his name.&lt;/ref&gt; made his first visit to ''[[Kanrei]]'' Hatakeyama Motokuni; and on this occasion, all the avenues along the route to and from the meeting were highly guarded.&lt;ref name="t343"&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA343,M1  p. 343.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1444''' (''Bun'an 1, 4th month''): The inhabitants of the eastern part of the capital and the western part of the capital each demanded exclusive rights to sell the dregs remaining from sake brewing. Crowds gathered at the Shinto shrine, [[Kitano Tenman-gū]]. ''Kanrei'' Motokuni sent troops to arrest the troublemakers, but they all escaped after having reduced the temple and much of western Kyoto to cinders.&lt;ref name="t343"/&gt;
* '''1444''' (''Bun'an 1, 8th month''): One of the [[Three Sacred Treasures]] was found after it had been missing for several months. The Sacred Jewel had been stolen in ''[[Kakitsu]]'' 3, on the 23rd day of the 9th month. Intruders in the palace had managed to steal all of the Sacred Treasures &amp;ndash; the mirror, the sword and the jewel. Later, a guard found the mirror and a priest found the sword, but the location of the jewel remained unknown until the 8th month of ''Bun'an gannen.''&lt;ref name="t343"/&gt;
* '''1445''' (''Bun'an 2, 11th month''): The ''kampaku'' [[Nijō Mochimoto]] died at age 48. [[Konoe Fusatsugu]] and [[Ichijō Kaneyoshi]] became the two primary contenders for this newly vacated position. The emperor sought ''Kanrei'' Motokuni's counsel before naming Fusatsugu to be the new ''kampaku''. The ''dainagon'' Fujiwara Tokifusa becomes ''naidaijin.''&lt;ref name="t343"/&gt;
* '''1445''' (''Bun'an 2, 11th month''): [[Hosokawa Katsumoto]] was named ''kanrei'' at the age of 12.&lt;ref name="t343"/&gt;
* '''1446''' (''Bun'an 3, 11th month''): The ''kampaku'' Fusatsugu asked the emperor to relieve him of his position as ''sadaijin.'' The ''udaijin'' Takakasa Fusahira succeeded Fusatsugu as ''sadaijin''; and the ''dainagon'' [[Nijō Mochimichi]] became ''udaijin.''&lt;ref name="t344"&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA344,M1  p. 344.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1446''' (''Bun'an 3, 11th month''): The shōgun received a patent from the emperor by which he learned that his name of "[[Ashikaga Yoshimasa|Yoshinari]]" had received Imperial approval.&lt;ref name="t344"/&gt;
* '''1447''' (''Bun'an 4, 11th month''): Yoshinari exercised regularly to improve the accuracy of his archery, and his arrows began to hit the center of the target sometimes.&lt;ref name="t345"&gt;Titsingh, [https://books.google.com/books?id=18oNAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PP9&amp;dq=nipon+o+dai+itsi+ran#PRA1-PA345,M1  p. 345.]&lt;/ref&gt;
* '''1448''' (''Bun'an 5, i2nd month''): The emperor moved in procession to visit his father; and the entire route was guarded by the troops of [[Hosokawa Katsumoto]].&lt;ref name="t345"/&gt;

'''Charles R. Lyons''' (1933–1999) was a professor of drama and comparative literature at [[Stanford University]] and co-owner of the art gallery [[Lyons Ltd]]. He received his AB (1955), MA (1956), and PhD (1964) from Stanford as well. As an undergraduate at Stanford he focused on [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] with the legendary professor [[Margery Bailey]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=UNFORGETTABLE TEACHERS: MARGERY BAILEY|url=http://www.stanfordalumni.org/news/magazine/2003/marapr/classnotes/bailey.html|accessdate=22 June 2011|newspaper=Stanford Magazine|date=March 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; the namesake of his endowed chair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Stanford Fill Professorships|url=http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=SJ&amp;s_site=mercurynews&amp;p_multi=SJ&amp;p_theme=realcities&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EB7275EC9D149FC&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM|accessdate=22 June 2011|newspaper=San Jose Mercury News|date=12 December 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Memorial Resolution: Charles R.

His interest in performance began in the 1950s as a professional actor in Los Angeles where he routinely performed at the [[Pasadena Playhouse]]. After finishing his masters, Lyons spent four years as a lieutenant in US Navy, where he served in the Far East and later in Washington, D.C as a liaison to [[Jacques Cousteau]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Blitzer|first=Carol|title=Affordable charm|url=http://www.paloaltoonline.com/weekly/morgue/2003/2003_03_28.charming28ja.html|accessdate=22 June 2011|newspaper=Palo Alto Weekly|date=March 28, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 1960s Lyons took a teaching position at [[Principia College]] in Illinois. In 1968 he moved on to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] becoming a professor of dramatic art and later the associate dean of letters and sciences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Memorial Resolution: Charles R.

Lyons' scholarly writings included Shakespeare, [[Anton Chekov|Chekov]], [[Henrik Ibsen|Ibsen]], [[Bertold Brecht|Brecht]], [[Samuel Beckett|Beckett]], and [[Sam Shepard|Shepard]]. His former students currently occupy key positions in theater and performance departments across the US and in Europe, as well in repertory theaters, professional theater companies, and the film industry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boudreau|first=John|title=Curtains for Stanford's Drama Dept.? : Stage: Beset by budget woes, the university's acclaimed drama program faces severe cuts .|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1991-12-26/entertainment/ca-1312_1_drama-program|accessdate=22 June 2011|newspaper=Los Angeles Times|date=December 26, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Throughout his career, Lyons continued to work at the practice of theater, directing productions of John Gay's ''[[The Beggar's Opera]]'', Samuel Beckett’s ''[[Endgame (play)|Endgame]]'', William Shakespeare's ''[[Two Gentlemen of Verona]]'' and ''[[Hamlet]]'' with [[Andre Braugher]] in the title role.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Lyons|first=Charles|title=Addressing the American Theater|journal=American Literary History|year=1983|volume=5|issue=1|pages=159–171|jstor=489766|doi=10.1093/alh/5.1.159}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerned with diversity issues within the arts, Lyons put forward a new [[Institute for Diversity in the Arts]] at Stanford, financed by the [[James Irvine Foundation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ray|first=ELAINE|title=Charles Lyons, who shaped Drama Department over past 26 years, dies at 66|url=http://news.stanford.edu/news/1999/may12/lyonsobit-512.html|accessdate=19 June 2011|newspaper=The Stanford Report|date=12 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=STANFORD GIVEN $3.2 MILLION FOR NEW PROGRAMS|newspaper=San Jose Mercury News|date=April 7, 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4577">'''Charles Sidney Spencer''' (born 12 June 1950) is Curator of Mexican and Central American Archaeology in the Division of [[Anthropology]] at the [[American Museum of Natural History]] in [[New York City]].  

"Dr. Spencer is an internationally renowned anthropological archaeologist specializing in the origins of hierarchical societies and the rise of the first political states in [[Mesoamerica]], where he has been conducting fieldwork for more than 25 years. His focus is the [[Oaxaca|Oaxaca Valley]] and surrounding regions, a mountainous part of southern [[Mexico]] that is home to the [[Zapotec peoples|Zapotec]] people. He is also widely recognized as a leader in the application of [[evolution|evolutionary theory]] and socio-political concepts to the study of prehistoric cultural change and has formulated a mathematical model of pristine [[state formation]]."&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/science/papers/academies.php American Museum of Natural History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Spencer completed his graduate training at the [[University of Michigan]], where he received his Ph.D. in [[Anthropology]] in 1981.  His dissertation, "The Cuicatlán Cañada and [[Monte Albán]]: Interregional Processes and Primary State Formation in Central Oaxaca," was published by Academic Press in 1982.  He has over 110 publications to date, including books, chapters, and articles.  Since the 1970s, Spencer has conducted extensive archaeological fieldwork in [[Mexico]] and [[Venezuela]].  He has trained a generation of graduate students in methodologies of field research, and he also has served on doctoral committees as primary advisor and as a reader.

Prior to his appointment at the AMNH in 1991, Dr. Spencer was Associate Professor of Anthropology at the [[University of Connecticut]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnh.org/science/divisions/anthro/bio.php?scientist=spencer American Museum of Natural History&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;   He was born June 12, 1950 in Ancon, Panama, then part of the [[Panama Canal Zone]].  He attended local U.S.-operated schools in the Canal Zone before leaving Panama to attend [[Rice University]], where he received his BA in Anthropology in 1972.  

In 2007, Dr. Spencer was elected to membership in the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]], one of the highest honors a scientist can receive from a U.S.-based organization.  At his induction ceremony in April 2008, NAS President Ralph Cicerone lauded Dr. Spencer as "the leading evolutionary archaeologist of his generation."  The citation continues: "His fieldwork has documented the rise of entrepreneurial rank societies, the origin of the stratified militaristic state, and the strategies of imperial colonization. His work combines empirical data with evolutionary concepts like tempo, mode, biased transmission, and adaptive peaks."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nasonline.org/site/Dir/2087896018?pg=vprof&amp;mbr=1010617&amp;returl=http://www.nasonline.org/site/Dir/2087896018?pg=srch&amp;view=basic&amp;retmk=search_again_link National Academy of Sciences:&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

Dr. Spencer is also a Fellow of the [[American Academy of Arts and Sciences]], along with his wife and research collaborator, Elsa M. Redmond, Ph.D.  They reside in the Connecticut suburbs of New York City.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==Career==
Pugsley became interested in writing in 1984 when, as a career officer in the [[New Zealand Army]], he worked on a television documentary about [[New Zealand]]'s involvement in the [[Gallipoli campaign]] and authored ''Gallipoli: The New Zealand Story'', which was shortlisted for the Goodman Fielder Wattie Book Award the same year.&lt;ref name=NZBC&gt;{{cite web |title=Pugsley, Christopher |url=https://www.bookcouncil.org.nz/writer/pugsley-christopher/ |publisher=New Zealand Book Council |accessdate=4 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1988, he retired from the New Zealand Army&lt;ref name=NZBC/&gt; to dedicate himself to a new career as historian.

===Academic career===
He received his PhD from the [[University of Waikato]] in 1992, and in 1994 he became Writing Fellow at the [[Victoria University of Wellington]].&lt;ref name=alumni&gt;{{cite web|title=New Zealand's foremost military historian to receive alumni award|url=http://www.waikato.ac.nz/news-events/media/2011/paid-to-indulge-military-historian-acknowledged|website=University of Waikato|accessdate=8 March 2018|date=3 August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then taught at [[University of New England, Australia]] from 1996 to 1999. Until 2014 he was Senior Lecturer in War Studies&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandhurst.mod.uk/academic/pugsley.htm RMAS biography]&lt;/ref&gt; at the [[Royal Military Academy Sandhurst]] and Adjunct Senior Fellow&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hist.canterbury.ac.nz/senior_fellows.shtml Canterbury Fellows page]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; at New Zealand's [[University of Canterbury]].

==Areas of interest==
During the 1990s he wrote a series of detailed articles called "Walking the Waikato Wars", in the now defunct New Zealand Defence Quarterly, in which he visited each Waikato Battle site and reviewed each battle through the eyes of a modern professional military officer using photographs and maps to illustrate events.

His primary area of interest is 20th-century New Zealand, Australian, Canadian and British Commonwealth military history, with particular focus on Gallipoli, and the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].

==Honours==
In the [[2015 New Year Honours (New Zealand)|2015 New Year Honours]], Pugsley was appointed an [[New Zealand Order of Merit|Officer of the New Zealand Order of Merit]], for services as a military historian.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.dpmc.govt.nz/publications/new-year-honours-list-2015 | title=New Year honours list 2015 |date=31 December 2014 | publisher=Department of the Prime Minister and Cabinet | accessdate=14 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011 the University of Waikato recognised him with a distinguished alumni award.&lt;ref name=alumni /&gt;

[[George Lucas]]'s [[science fiction]] multi-film ''[[Star Wars]]'' saga has had a significant impact on modern [[popular culture]].

Many efforts produced in the science fiction genre (particularly in film) can now be seen to draw heavy influence and inspiration from the original ''Star Wars'' trilogy as well as the magnitude of sequels, spin-offs, series, games and texts that it spawned. Sounds, visuals, and even the iconic score of the films have become integral components in the tapestry of American society. The film helped launch the science fiction boom of the late 1970s and early 1980s, making [[science fiction film]]s a [[blockbuster (entertainment)|blockbuster genre]].&lt;ref name=Cook&gt;{{cite book|last1=Cook|first1=David A.|title=Lost Illusions: American Cinema in the Shadow of Watergate and Vietnam, 1970–1979|date=2000|publisher=University of California Press|location=Berkeley|isbn=0-520-23265-8|edition=1st paperback print.}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Page needed|date=June 2016}} This very impact also made it a prime target for parody works and homages, with popular examples including ''[[Spaceballs]]'', ''[[Family Guy]]''{{'}}s "[[Blue Harvest]]" special, [[Seth Green]]'s "[[Robot Chicken: Star Wars]]", and Lucas's self-proclaimed favorite parody, "[[Hardware Wars]]" by [[Ernie Fosselius]].

===Filmmaking history===

====Financial impact on Fox====
[[20th Century Fox]] optioned ''Star Wars''. When it unexpectedly became the decade's blockbuster, grossing $100 million in three months, Fox's stock soared from $6 to $25 per share and generated revenues of $1.2 million a day for the studio. Fox purchased the [[Aspen Skiing Company|Aspen skiing]] and [[Pebble Beach Golf Links|Pebble Beach golf]] corporations with the increased cash flow and still declared excess profits in 1977. Income from ''Star Wars'' re-releases, sequels, and merchandising enriched the studio in the following decades. ''Star Wars'' helped Fox to change from an almost bankrupt [[production company]] to a thriving media conglomerate.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt;

====Impact on filmmaking====
''Star Wars'' fundamentally changed the aesthetics and narratives of [[Cinema of the United States|Hollywood]] films,&lt;ref name=Bigsby&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bigsby|first1=Christopher|title=The Cambridge Companion to Modern American Culture|date=2006|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge|isbn=0-521-84132-1|edition=[Online-Ausg.].}}&lt;/ref&gt; switching the focus of Hollywood-made films from deep, meaningful stories based on dramatic conflict, themes and [[irony]] to sprawling special-effects-laden blockbusters, as well as changing the Hollywood film industry in fundamental ways. Before ''Star Wars'', special effects in films had not appreciably advanced since the 1950s.&lt;ref name=Bigsby/&gt; ''Star Wars'' was also important in the movement towards the use of [[computer-generated imagery]] in films.&lt;ref name="chicago"/&gt; The commercial success of ''Star Wars'' created a boom in state-of-the-art special effects in the late 1970s. There was increased investment in [[special effect]]s. Companies like [[Industrial Light &amp; Magic]] and [[Digital Productions]] were created to provide them. The 1977 ''Star Wars'' pioneered the genre pastiche, where several classic film genres are combined in one film. In ''Star Wars'', the genres were science fiction, the Western, the war film, and the quasi-mystical epic.&lt;ref name=Cook/&gt; Along with ''[[Jaws (film)|Jaws]]'', ''Star Wars'' started the tradition of the summer blockbuster film in the entertainment industry, where films open on many screens at the same time and profitable [[Media franchise|franchises]] are important.&lt;ref name="chicago"/&gt;&lt;ref name=pbs/&gt; It created the model for the major film trilogy and showed that merchandising rights on a film could generate more money than the film itself did.&lt;ref name=msn/&gt;

The holographic video effect associated with ''Star Wars'' served as a technological tool for [[CNN]] during its 2008 Election Night coverage. CNN reporter [[Jessica Yellin]] and musician [[will.i.am]] looked as though they were in the network's [[New York City]] studios talking face-to-face with hosts [[Anderson Cooper]] and [[Wolf Blitzer]], when in reality, they were in [[Chicago]] at [[Barack Obama]]'s rally. The process involved Yellin and will.i.am standing in front of a blue screen in a special tent, while being shot by 35 HD cameras.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.chicagotribune.com:80/entertainment/tv/chi-cnn-hologram-081104-story,0,2621692.story |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081108053032/http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/tv/chi-cnn-hologram-081104-story%2C0%2C2621692.story |archivedate=November 8, 2008 |title=The Watcher: Freaky CNN hologram recalls 'Star Wars' - chicagotribune.com |publisher=Web.archive.org |date=2008-11-06 |accessdate=2016-06-13 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=====Parodies=====
The ''Star Wars'' saga has had a significant impact on modern American [[popular culture|pop culture]], both the films and characters have received [[List of Star Wars films and television series|official parodies in numerous films and television productions]], such as ''[[Family Guy]]''{{'}}s tribute-spoof season premiere episode called "[[Blue Harvest (Family Guy)|Blue Harvest]]", in dedication of the saga's 30th anniversary.

====Fan films====
{{Main category|Fan films based on Star Wars}}
The ''Star Wars'' saga has inspired many fans to create their own non-canon material set in the ''Star Wars'' galaxy. In recent years, this has ranged from writing fan-fiction to creating [[fan film]]s. In 2002, Lucasfilm sponsored the first annual [[The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards|Official ''Star Wars'' Fan Film Awards]], officially recognizing filmmakers and the genre. Because of concerns over potential [[copyright]] and trademark issues, however, the contest was initially open only to [[parody|parodies]], [[mockumentary|mockumentaries]], and documentaries. Fan-fiction films set in the ''Star Wars'' universe were originally ineligible, but in 2007 Lucasfilm changed the submission standards to allow in-universe fiction entries.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|accessdate=March 28, 2008|url = http://www.accessmylibrary.com/coms2/summary_0286-25279212_ITM |title=Filmmaker Kevin Smith Hosts 'The Official Star Wars Fan Film Awards' on SCI FI Channel; George Lucas to Present Special Honor | work = [[Business Wire]]|date=April 23, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lucasfilm, for the most part, has allowed but not endorsed the creation of these derivative fan-fiction works, so long as no such work attempts to make a profit from or tarnish the ''Star Wars'' franchise in any way.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |first = Sarah | last= Knapton|title= Court to rule in Star Wars costume battle|url= http://film.guardian.co.uk/news/story/0,,2271561,00.html|work=The Guardian |location=UK |date = April 7, 2008|accessdate=April 15, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While many fan films have used elements from the licensed Expanded Universe to tell their story, they are not considered an official part of the ''Star Wars'' canon. However, the lead character from the ''[[Pink Five]]'' series was incorporated into [[Timothy Zahn]]'s 2007 novel ''[[Allegiance (novel)|Allegiance]]'', marking the first time a fan-created ''Star Wars'' character has ever crossed into the official canon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20080727-9999-1a27starfilm.html |work=The San Diego Union Tribune |title=Final installment of 'Star Wars' parody is out there – somewhere |first=Peter |last=Rowe |accessdate=March 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080804000110/http://www.signonsandiego.com/news/features/20080727-9999-1a27starfilm.html |archivedate=August 4, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although since 2014, the novel became re-branded as [[Star Wars Legends|Legends]], the character has yet to reappear into the revised [[Star Wars canon|canon]].

The [[National Air and Space Museum|Smithsonian's National Air and Space Museum]] had an exhibition called "''Star Wars'': The Magic of Myth". It was an exhibition of original production models, props, costumes, and characters from the first three ''Star Wars'' films.&lt;ref name=Lancaster&gt;{{cite book|editor-last1=Lancaster|editor-first1=Kurt|editor-last2=Mikotowicz |editor-first2=Tom|last=Mackay|first=Daniel|chapter=Star Wars:The Magic of the Anti-Myth |title=Performing the Force: Essays on Immersion into Science Fiction, Fantasy and Horror Environments|date=2001|publisher=McFarland|location=Jefferson, N.C|isbn=0-7864-0895-2|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://airandspace.si.edu/exhibitions/star-wars/online/|title=Star Wars:The Magic of Myth, National Air and Space Museum|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2007, NASA launched a [[STS-120|space shuttle]] carrying an original lightsaber into orbit. The prop handle had been used as Luke Skywalker's lightsaber in ''Return of the Jedi''. After spending two weeks in orbit, it was brought back to Earth on November 7, 2007, to be returned to its owner George Lucas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nasa.gov/mission_pages/shuttle/behindscenes/Whatsgoingup.html |title=NASA – Items Taken Into Space Reflect Accomplishments on Earth |publisher=Nasa.gov |date=2007-11-23 |accessdate=2016-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first successfully launched space-rocket, to be sent by the [[private spaceflight]] company [[SpaceX]], was named the [[Falcon 1]]. [[Elon Musk]] used the word "falcon" within the name of the space-rocket, as a reference to the [[Millennium Falcon]] from Star Wars. The Falcon 1's success led to the fabrication of updated versions of the space rocket, in what became known as the Falcon family of space-rockets. The Falcon 1 has since been retired, in favor of the [[Falcon 9]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.space.com/35381-spectacular-spacex-rocket-landing-photos.html|title=These SpaceX Rocket Landing Photos Are Simply Jaw-Dropping|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Organisms named after ''Star Wars'' characters===
Characters and other fictional elements from ''Star Wars'' have inspired several scientific names of organisms.

Examples include:

===Political impact===
When [[Ronald Reagan]] proposed the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] (SDI), a system of lasers and missiles meant to intercept incoming [[Intercontinental ballistic missile|ICBMs]], the plan was quickly labeled "Star Wars", implying that it was science fiction and linking it to Reagan's acting career. According to [[Frances FitzGerald (journalist)|Frances FitzGerald]], Reagan was annoyed by this, but Assistant Secretary of Defense [[Richard Perle]] told colleagues that he "thought the name was not so bad."; "'Why not?' he said. 'It's a good movie. Besides, the good guys won.'"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| first= Frances| last= Fitzgerald | publisher = [[Simon &amp; Schuster]]|title=Way Out There in the Blue|isbn=0-684-84416-8 | url = https://www.nytimes.com/books/first/f/fitzgerald-blue.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; This gained further resonance when Reagan described the [[Soviet Union]] as an "[[Evil Empire speech|evil empire]]".

In television commercials, public interest group critics of the [[Ronald Reagan|Reagan]] administration's [[Strategic Defense Initiative]] program deridingly referred to the orbital missile defense project as "Star Wars". [[Lucasfilm]] originally sued to try to enjoin this usage of its trademark, and lost.&lt;ref name=HighFrontier&gt;''Lucasfilm Ltd. v. High Frontier'', 622 F.Supp. 931 (D.D.C. 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Explaining its decision, the court said,

{{quote|When politicians, newspapers, and the public generally use the phrase star wars for their convenience, in parody or descriptively to further a communication of their views on SDI, plaintiff has no rights as owner of the mark to prevent this use of STAR WARS. ...

===Religion (Jediism)===
{{Main|Jediism|Jedi census phenomenon}}

There is a real religion based on ''Star Wars''.

Realising that the loss of George Lucas's films has caused team members [[Atom (Ray Palmer)|Ray Palmer]] and [[Commander Steel#Live-action|Nate Heywood]] to lose their abilities, as Lucas's films were the inspiration for Ray and Nate's interests in science and history respectively. As a result, the team must convince Lucas to return to film school so that his work will inspire them in their future lives, with Lucas being convinced to return during a fight when the team are nearly killed in a garbage compactor, his decision restoring Ray and Nate's powers and allowing them to escape.

'''David Hill''' (born 20 June 1946) is an [[English people|English]]-born [[Australia]]n business leader and  [[writer|author]].

==Background and early career==
Born [[illegitimate]]ly in [[Eastbourne]], [[East Sussex]] in 1946, into an impoverished family of four boys, Hill and his twin brother spent time in [[Barnardo's]] children's home in [[Barkingside]] in Essex.&lt;ref name=migrantcentre/&gt; 
{{quotation|I can only remember it as traumatic. The idea of nurturing and care and affection and love just didn't enter the equation back in those days. I can remember Mum gave us some coloured writing paper so we could write to her. I remember the other kids stealing our paper, humiliating us, tearing it up and running away. It was only much later I realised a lot of this cruelty was that most of them didn't have anybody to write to.|David Hill, interviewed in 2008.}}

Hill's early years of schooling were at Bourne Junior Primary School. He migrated to Australia together with his elder brother and twin brother, and departed from [[Tilbury Docks]], [[London]] in April 1959 aboard the ''[[RMS Strathaird|SS Strathaird]]''. His mother arrived in Australia a few years later.&lt;ref name=migrantcentre&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.migrationheritage.nsw.gov.au/exhibition/belongings/david-hill/ |title=David Hill |work=Belongings: Post WWII migration memories and journeys |publisher=Migration Heritage Centre of New South Wales |first=Andrea |last=Fernandes |date=14 November 2008 |accessdate=15 March 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=talkingheads/&gt; Prior to departing England, Hill and his brothers had enrolled to attend Fairbridge Farm School in [[Molong, New South Wales|Molong]], near {{NSWcity|Orange}} in the [[Central West (New South Wales)|Central West]] region of New South Wales. Hill has since written a book about the experiences of the pupils there.&lt;ref name=talkingheads/&gt;  The documentary ''The Long Journey Home'' was aired on [[ABC1|ABC TV]] on 17 November 2009, detailing some of the history associated with Fairbridge Farm School and other [[orphanage]]s of that time.

Prior to his rise to prominence in business circles, Hill was variously a hardware shop assistant, a sandwich cutter, a labourer on building sites, a refuse collector and gardener, he sold tennis coaching courses, worked as a barman, waiter, pub [[security guard|bouncer]], delivery agent, tutor at the [[University of Sydney]], was a journalist, worked in [[investment bank]]ing, as an accountant, and was in charge of the NSW Government Ministerial Advisory Unit.&lt;ref name=migrantcentre/&gt;

{{DeLeonism}}
{{Marxism}}
{{Syndicalism sidebar}}
'''De Leonism''', occasionally known as '''Marxism–De Leonism''', is a [[Libertarian Marxism|libertarian Marxist]] current developed by the American activist [[Daniel De Leon]]. De Leon was an early leader of the first [[United States]] [[Socialism|socialist]] [[political party]], the [[Socialist Labor Party of America]] (SLP). De Leon combined the rising theories of [[revolutionary syndicalism]] in his time with [[orthodox Marxism]]. According to De Leonist theory, militant [[Industrial unionism|industrial unions]] are the vehicle of [[class struggle]]. [[Industrial unionism|Industrial unions]] serving the interests of the [[proletariat]] ([[working class]]) will bring about the change needed to establish a [[Socialist mode of production|socialist system]]. While sharing some characteristics of [[anarcho-syndicalism]] (the management of workplaces through unions) and with the SLP being a member of the predominantly anarcho-syndicalist [[Industrial Workers of the World]] (IWW), De Leonism actually differs from it in that he and the modern SLP still believe in the necessity of a central government to coordinate production as well as in the use of a revolutionary political party in addition to union action to achieve its goals.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.slp.org/res_state_htm/slp_vs_iww.html&lt;/ref&gt;

== Tactics ==
According to the De Leonist theory, workers would simultaneously form socialist industrial unions in the workplaces and a socialist political party which would organize in the political realm. Upon achieving sufficient support for a victory at the polls, the political party would be voted into office, giving the De Leonist program a mandate from the people. It is assumed that at that point the socialist industrial unions will have attained sufficient strength in the [[wiktionary:workplace|workplace]]s for workers there to take control of the means of production.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The De Leonist victory at the polls would be accompanied by a transfer of control of the factories, mines, farms and other [[means of production]] to workers councils organized within the industrial unions. De Leonists distinguish this event from the [[general strike]] to take control of the workplaces advocated by anarcho-syndicalists and refer to it instead as a "general lockout of the ruling class".{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The existing government would then be replaced with a government elected from within the socialist industrial unions and the newly elected socialist government would quickly enact whatever constitutional amendments or other changes in the structure of government needed to bring this about, [[Adjournment sine die|adjourning ''sine die'']]. Workers on the shop floor would elect local shop floor [[committee]]s needed to continue production and representatives to local and national councils representing their particular industry.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

Workers would also elect representatives to a central [[congress]], called an All-Industrial Congress, which would effectively function as the [[Central government|national government]]. These representatives would be subject to a [[Recall election|recall vote]] at any time. De Leonism would thus reorganize the national government along industrial lines with representatives elected by industry, not by geographic location.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

== Comparison to other forms of socialism ==
De Leonism lies outside the [[Leninism|Leninist]] tradition of [[communism]]. It predates Leninism as De Leonism's principles developed in the early 1890s with De Leon's assuming leadership of the SLP. Leninism and its [[Vanguardism|vanguard party]] idea took shape after the 1902 publication of Lenin's ''[[What Is to Be Done?]]'' Its adherents are generally opposed to the policies of the former [[Soviet Union]] and those of the [[China|People's Republic of China]] and other [[socialist state]]s and do not consider them socialist, but rather [[State capitalism|state capitalist]] or following "bureaucratic state despotism". The highly [[Decentralization|decentralized]] and [[Democracy|democratic]] nature of the proposed De Leonist government is in contrast to the [[democratic centralism]] of [[Marxism–Leninism]] and what they see as the [[Dictatorship|dictatorial]] nature of the Soviet Union.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

The success of the De Leonist plan depends on achieving majority support among the people both in the workplaces and at the polls, in contrast to the Leninist notion that a small vanguard party should lead the working class to carry out the revolution. De Leonism's stance against [[reformism]] means that it is referred to by the label "[[Impossibilism|impossibilist]]", along with the [[Socialist Party of Great Britain]].{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

De Leonist political parties have also been criticized for being allegedly overly [[dogma]]tic and [[Sectarianism|sectarian]]. Despite their rejection of Leninism and vanguardism, De Leonism also lies outside the "[[Democratic socialism|democratic socialist]]" and "[[Social democracy|social democratic]]" tradition. De Leon and other De Leonist writers have issued frequent [[polemic]]s against democratic socialist movements, especially the [[Socialist Party of America]]; and consider them to be reformist or "[[Bourgeoisie|bourgeois]] socialist". De Leonists have traditionally refrained from any activity or alliances viewed by them as trying to reform [[capitalism]], though the Socialist Labor Party in De Leon's time was active during strikes and such, such as [[social justice]] movements, preferring instead to concentrate solely on the twin tasks of building support for a De Leonist political party and organizing socialist industrial unions.{{citation needed|date=February 2012}}

'''Donald Harman Akenson''' (born May 22, 1941, [[Minneapolis]], [[Minnesota]])  is a historian and author. He is widely acknowledged as the world's foremost expert in the history of worldwide Irish migration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.queensu.ca/history/people/facultyinstructors/akenson-donald|title=Akenson, Donald {{!}} Department of History|website=www.queensu.ca|language=en|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt; Notably prolific, he has written at least 22 book-length, scholarly monographs, 3 jointly-authored scholarly books, 6 works of fiction and historical fiction, and 55 scholarly articles.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.queensu.ca/history/sites/webpublish.queensu.ca.histwww/files/files/DHACVJanuary2016.pdf|title=Akenson Queen's University|last=Akenson|first=Donald|date=2017|website=Queen's University|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is a Fellow of both the [[Royal Society of Canada]] and the [[Royal Historical Society]] (UK). He is also a [[Molson Prize]] Laureate, awarded for a lifetime contribution to Canadian culture (other winners include [[Margaret Atwood]], [[Marshall McLuhan]], and [[Glenn Gould]]). He was awarded a [[Guggenheim Fellowship]] in 1984, and in 1992 he won the prestigious [[Grawemeyer Award]], then the richest non-fiction book prize in the world. Akenson received his B.A. from [[Yale University]] and his doctorate from [[Harvard University]]. He is Douglas Professor of History at [[Queen's University]] in [[Kingston, Ontario]], Canada and was simultaneously Beamish Research Professor at the Institute of Irish Studies, [[University of Liverpool]] (2006–10), and Senior Editor of the [[McGill-Queen's University Press]] (1982-2012).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Irish History ==
Originally trained in economics and statistics at Yale, Akenson's mentor in the study of Irish History was John V. Kelleher, the founder of the Department of Celtic Languages and Literature at Harvard.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.irishtimes.com/news/john-v-kelleher-creative-force-for-establishment-of-irish-studies-in-us-universities-1.1130518|title=John V. Kelleher Creative force for establishment of Irish studies in US universities|work=The Irish Times|access-date=2017-09-05|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; All together, Akenson has written twenty-four books on the subject of Ireland.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Akenson's early works in Irish history focused on the religious history of Ireland, particularly the often ignored history of the [[Church of Ireland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=J.|first=Brose, Olive|date=1973-04-01|title=Donald Harman Akenson. &lt;italic&gt;The Church of Ireland: Ecclesiastical Reform and Revolution, 1800–1885&lt;/italic&gt;. New Haven: Yale University Press. 1971. Pp. xiii, 413. $15.00|url=https://academic.oup.com/ahr/article-abstract/78/2/452/146298/Donald-Harman-Akenson-The-Church-of-Ireland?redirectedFrom=fulltext|journal=The American Historical Review|language=en|volume=78|issue=2|doi=10.1086/ahr/78.2.452|issn=0002-8762}}&lt;/ref&gt; and on the history of Irish education, with an emphasis on how educational practices either tended to heal or to further engender sectarian strife. Brian Titley wrote of Akenson's efforts in the chronicling of Irish education that "until it attracted the attention of D.H. Akenson, the writing of Irish educational history was moribund, amateurish and narrow in both scope and sympathy."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=TITLEY|first=BRIAN|date=1979|title=The Historiography of Irish Education: A Review Essay|jstor=23768464|journal=The Journal of Educational Thought (JET) / Revue de la Pensée Éducative|volume=13|issue=1|pages=66–77|doi=10.2307/23768464}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Akenson then moved more exclusively to the study of the Irish diaspora, and now, having written well over a dozen books on Irish history and Irish migration, is considered "the most distinguished scholar of the history of the Irish diaspora."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.amazon.com/Ireland-Sweden-Great-European-Migration/dp/1846317509|title=Ireland, Sweden and the Great European Migration: 1815-1914. by Donald Harman Akenson|last=Akenson|first=Donald H.|date=2012-07-01|publisher=Liverpool University Press|isbn=9781846317507|location=Liverpool|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; He became known to many Irish-American scholars in 1984 and 1985 when in his ''The Irish In Ontario'' (1984) and ''Being Had: Historians, Evidence, and the Irish in North America'' (1985) he controversially called for (1) historians of Irish immigration in North America to make use of the better-documented Canadian data on Irish immigration and (2) historians to recognize that the long practice of ignoring Irish Protestant migration, particularly in the nineteenth century, was at best a foolish mistake and at worst a case of scholarly bigotry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dennis|first=Clark,|date=1986-02-01|title=&lt;sc&gt;donald harman akenson&lt;/sc&gt;. &lt;italic&gt;Being Had: Historians, Evidence, and the Irish in North America&lt;/italic&gt;.

In this latter work, and indeed as in all of his books, Akenson pulls no punches.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.historyireland.com/20th-century-contemporary-history/the-irish-diaspora/|title=The Irish Diaspora|date=2013-01-25|work=History Ireland|access-date=2017-09-06|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the publication of ''Being Had'' in 1985, he has remained one of the most respected but controversial scholars of Irish migration. In 1990 the [[Social Sciences and Humanities Research Council]] &lt;nowiki/&gt;of Canada named ''The Irish in Ontario'' (1984) "one of the most important publications in social science in the past 50 years in Canada,"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; and in 1994 he was named the winner of the [[Trillium Book Award]] for his biography of Irish writer and politician, [[Conor Cruise O'Brien]], ''Conor: The Biography of Conor Cruise O'Brien'' (1994).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Of his latest contribution to the history of Irish Migration, ''Ireland, Sweden and the Great European Migration, 1815–1914'' (2013), fellow Irish Diaspora historian Donald MacRaild wrote: "This monumental study clearly will have a huge impact in the field. Typically of Akenson, an original thinker of the first order, it debunks many myths, half-truths, and lazy assumptions on the part of historians. However, this isn't simply a book which debunks. It isn't a tract or a treatise. Its central contribution is in offering one of the best (perhaps the very best) comparative history of European emigration."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://liverpooluniversitypress.co.uk/products/60377|title=Ireland, Sweden and the Great European Migration - Liverpool University Press|website=Liverpool University Press|language=en|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Religious History ==
While mostly noted as a scholar of Irish migration, Akenson is also an award-winning scholar of religious history. His book ''God’s Peoples: Covenant and Land in South Africa, Israel, and Ulster'' was named the winner of the 1992 [[Grawemeyer Award]] for "ideas improving world order." At the time, the Grawemeyer Award was the richest non-fiction book prize in the world. Other notable winners include [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] and [[Aaron T. Beck]] (considered the father of cognitive therapy). ''Library Journal'' named ''God’s Peoples'' one of the best 30 books published in the US in all genres in 1992.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; His other works on religious history have also been highly praised. ''Some Family: The Mormons and How Humanity Keeps Track of Itself'' (2007) was a finalist for the British Columbia Achievement Prize for Best Canadian Non-fiction Book; ''Saint Saul: A Skeleton Key to the Historical Jesus'' (2000) was short-listed for the Canadian Writers’ Trust Prize; and ''Surpassing Wonder: The Invention of the Bible and the Talmuds'' (1998) was shortlisted for the [[Governor General's Awards]] for Non-fiction. A Senior Editor at McGill-Queen's University Press for thirty years, Akenson remains the editor of McGill-Queen's Studies in the History of Religion, series two, which includes more than seventy books by eminent scholars such as [[Jacob Neusner]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.mqup.ca/browse-books-pages-46.php?filters=a:1:%7Bi:13;s:4:%223735%22;%7D|title=Browse Books {{!}} McGill-Queen’s University Press|website=www.mqup.ca|access-date=2017-09-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Editor ==
In addition to teaching and research, Akenson was senior editor of McGill-Queen's University Press from 1982 to 2012. He was editor or founding editor of two long-running series of histories published by McGill-Queen's University Press: (1) the McGill-Queen's Studies in the History of Religion, series two (dedicated to the memory of George A. Rawlyk); (2) McGill-Queen's Studies in Ethnic History; and independently (3) Canadian Papers in Rural History.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; He remains the editor of the McGill-Queen's Studies in the History of Religion series.

'''Ernst Toller''' (1 December 1893 – 22 May 1939) was a [[Germany|German]] left-wing [[playwright]], best known for his [[Expressionism (theatre)|Expressionist]] plays. He served in 1919 for six days as President of the short-lived [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]], and was imprisoned for five years for his actions.&lt;ref name=Britannica&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/598659/Ernst-Toller |title=Ernst Toller|last= |first= |work= |date= |publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica |accessdate=17 Feb 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He wrote several plays and poetry during that period, which gained him international renown. They were performed in London and New York as well as Berlin. In 2000, several of his plays were published in an English translation.

In 1933 Toller was exiled from Germany after the [[Nazis]] came to power. He did a lecture tour in 1936-1937 in the United States and Canada, settling in California for a while before going to New York. He joined other exiles there. Struggling financially and depressed at learning his brother and sister had been sent to a [[concentration camp]] in Germany, he committed suicide in May 1939.

== Life and career ==
Toller was born in 1893 into a [[Jewish]] family in [[Szamocin|Samotschin (Szamocin)]], [[Province of Posen]], [[Kingdom of Prussia|Prussia]] (now [[Poznań]], Poland). He was the son of Ida (Kohn) and Max Toller, a pharmacist. His parents ran a general store.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.ca/books?id=jAr6iCh4_HAC&amp;pg=PA2&amp;dq=Ernst+Toller+Ida,+nee+Kohn,+and+his+father,+Max&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjy-qmS3vHeAhWnt1kKHWHuCwAQ6AEIFDAA]&lt;/ref&gt; He had a sister and brother. They grew up speaking Yiddish and German, and he later became fluent in English. The most recent biography on Toller is Robert Ellis' Ernst Toller and German Society. Intellectuals as Leaders and Critics published by Fairleigh Dickinson University Press.

At the outbreak of [[World War I]], he volunteered for military duty. After serving for 13 months on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]],&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; he suffered a complete physical and psychological collapse. His first drama, ''Transformation'' (''Die Wandlung'', 1919), was wrought from his wartime experiences.

Together with leading [[anarchists]], such as [[B. Traven]] and [[Gustav Landauer]], and [[communist]]s, Toller was involved in the short-lived 1919 [[Bavarian Soviet Republic]]. He served as President from April 6 to April 12. His government did little to restore order in [[Munich]]. His government members were not always well-chosen. For instance, the Foreign Affairs Deputy Dr. {{Interlanguage link multi|Franz Lipp|fr|vertical-align=sup}} (who had been admitted several times to psychiatric hospitals) informed [[Vladimir Lenin]] via cable that the ousted former Minister President, [[Johannes Hoffmann (SPD)|Johannes Hoffmann]], had fled to [[Bamberg]] and taken the key to the ministry toilet with him.  On Palm Sunday, April 1919, the [[Communist Party of Germany|Communist Party]] seized power, with [[Eugen Leviné]] as their leader.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| url=https://books.google.com/?id=-X4jgPG0360C&amp;pg=PA58&amp;lpg=PA58&amp;dq=bavarian+republic+levine+coup#v=onepage&amp;q=bavarian%20republic%20levine%20coup&amp;f=false| author=Jeffrey S. Gaab| title=Munich: Hofbräuhaus &amp; History| publisher=Peter Lang| page=58| isbn=9780820486062| year=2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortly after that, the republic was defeated by [[right-wing]] forces.

The noted authors [[Max Weber]] and [[Thomas Mann]] testified on Toller's behalf when he was tried for his part in the revolution. He was sentenced to five years in prison and served his sentence in the prisons of [[Stadelheim Prison|Stadelheim]], Neuburg, [[Eichstätt]]. From February 1920 until his release, he was in the fortress of [[Niederschönenfeld]], where he spent 149 days in solitary confinement and 24 days on hunger strike.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Dove|first=Richard|title=He Was a German: A Biography of Ernst Toller|year=1990|publisher=Libris|location=London|isbn=1870352858}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His time in prison was productive; he completed work on ''Transformation'', which premiered in Berlin under the direction of [[Karlheinz Martin]] in September 1919. At the time of this work's 100th performance, the Bavarian government offered Toller a pardon. He refused it out of solidarity with other [[political prisoner]]s. Toller continued writing in prison, completing some of what would be his most celebrated works, including the dramas ''Masses Man'' (''Masse Mensch''), ''The Machine Breakers'' (''Die Maschinenstürmer''), ''Hinkemann, the German'' (''Der deutsche Hinkemann''), and many poems. These works established him as an important German expressionist playwright, and they used symbols derived from the First World War and its aftermath in his society.

Not until after his release from prison in July 1925 was Toller able to see any of his plays performed. In 1925, the most famous of his later dramas, ''[[Hoppla, We're Alive!]]'' (''Hoppla, wir Leben!''), directed by [[Erwin Piscator]], premiered in Berlin. It tells of a  revolutionary discharged from a mental hospital after eight years, who discovers that his former comrades have grown complacent and compromised within the system they once opposed. In despair, he kills himself.&lt;ref&gt;Pearlman, Alan Raphael, ed. and trans. 2000. ''Plays One: Transformation, Masses Man, Hoppla, We're Alive!.'' By Ernst Toller. Absolute Classics series.

Intellectuals as Leaders and Critics" published by Fairleigh Dickinson University Press.{{Citation needed|date=October 2017}}

==Exile ==
In 1933, after the [[Nazi]] rise to power, Toller was exiled from Germany because of his work; the Nazis did not like modernist arts of any form. His citizenship was nullified by the Nazi government later that year. He traveled to London with 16 year old [[Christiane Grautoff]]; they married in London in 1935, the same year he participated as co-director in the Manchester production of his play ''Rake Out the Fires'' (''Feuer aus den Kesseln'').

In 1936 and 1937, Toller went on a lecture tour of the United States and Canada, settling in California. Fluent in English, he wrote screenplays but could not get them produced. In 1936 he moved to New York City, where he joined a group of artists and writers in exile, including [[Klaus Mann]], [[Erika Mann]] (at one time married to the poet [[W.H. Auden]], who was also in the US), and [[Therese Giehse]]. He earned some money from journalism.

Two of his early plays were produced in New York in this period: ''The Machine Wreckers'' (1922), whose opening night in 1937 he attended, and ''No More Peace'', produced in 1937 by the [[Federal Theatre Project]] and presented in New York City in 1938. Their sense of immediacy was gone: the first play was related to the First World War and its aftermath, and the second an earlier period of the rise of the Nazis. Their style was outmoded for New York, and the poor reception added to Toller's discouragement.&lt;ref name="bauland"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=wb_JWr4XSdsC&amp;pg=PA112&amp;lpg=PA112&amp;dq=Bloody+Laughter+by+Toller&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=fz99o2nQiD&amp;sig=2AcLYtR2W33cz9FpevOBeR2LmvM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=YlgzUrPEB4aLqQHQyYDAAg&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q=Bloody%20Laughter%20by%20Toller&amp;f=false Peter Bauland, ''The Hooded Eagle: Modern German Drama on the New York Stage''], Syracuse University Press, 1968, pp. 112-114&lt;/ref&gt;

Suffering from deep [[depression (mood)|depression]] after learning that his sister and brother had been arrested and sent to [[concentration camp]]s, and struggling with financial woes (he had given all his money to [[Spanish Civil War]] refugees), Toller committed [[suicide]] on May 22, 1939. He hanged himself in his room&lt;ref name=Britannica /&gt; at the [[Mayflower Hotel (New York)|Mayflower Hotel]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/ni/vol05/no08/fischer.htm|title=The Suicide of Ernst Toller|last=Fisher|first=Oscar|work=New International, Vol. 5, No. 8|date=August 1939|accessdate=22 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; after laying out on his hotel desk "photos of Spanish children who had been killed by fascist bombs."&lt;ref&gt;Jean-Michel Palmier, Weimar in Exile, pg 360&lt;/ref&gt;

[[W. H. Auden]]'s poem "In Memory of Ernst Toller" was published in ''[[Another Time (book)|Another Time]]'' (1940).

The English author [[Robert Payne (author)|Robert Payne]], who knew Toller in Spain and in Paris, later wrote in his diary that Toller had said shortly before his death:   
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If ever you read that I committed suicide, I beg you not to believe it."  Payne continued: "He hanged himself with the silk cord of his nightgown in a hotel in New York two years ago. This is what the newspapers said at the time, but I continue to believe that he was murdered."&lt;ref&gt;Robert Payne, "Diary entry for May 23, 1942", ''Forever China'' (Chungking Diaries), New York: Dodd, Mead, 1945&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;/blockquote&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1526">A '''feud letter''' ({{lang-de|Fehdebrief}} or ''Absagebrief'') was a [[document]] in which a [[feud]] was announced – usually with few words - in medieval Europe. The letter had to be issued three days in advance in order to be legally valid.

So that the feud did not became a case of [[murder]] and thus become punishable by law, those involved had to abide by the following rules:

# The feud, whether between [[knight]]s or between the [[nobility]] and towns, had to be initiated by a formal feud letter
# The killing of innocent parties was forbidden
# The razing of houses and laying waste to the land was allowed
# During the feud, fighting was not permitted in churches or in the home, and the parties were to be allowed go to and return from church or court without being molested.

== Examples ==
* Around 1444, the town of [[Soest, Germany|Soest]] declared war on the [[Archbishop]] of [[Cologne]] at the start of the [[Soest Feud]] with the following famous, brief feud letter:

''"Wettet, biscop Dierich van Moeres, dat wy den vesten Junker Johan can Cleve lever hebbet alls Juwe, unde wert Juwe hiermit affgesaget"''&lt;br&gt;(''"Know this, Bishop Dietrich of Moers, that we prefer the steadfast [[Junker]], John of Cleves, to you, and hereby give you notice thereof."'')

'''Friedrich Christoph Förster''' (24 September 1791 in [[Saaleplatte|Münchengosserstädt]] on the [[Saale]] – 8 November 1868 in [[Berlin]]) was a [[Germany|German]] historian and [[poet]].

==Biography==
He was the second son of Karl Christoph Förster (1751-1811), and consequently an older brother of the painter [[Ernst Joachim Förster]] (1800-1885). He received his early education at [[Altenburg]], and after a course of [[theology]] at [[Jena]], devoted some time to [[archaeology]] and the history of art.

At the outbreak of the [[Sixth Coalition|War of Liberation]] against [[Napoleon]] in 1813, he joined the [[Lützow Free Corps]] with [[Theodor Körner (author)|Theodor Körner]], quickly attaining the rank of captain. Like Körner, he wrote spirited war songs, which added to the national enthusiasm. On the conclusion of the war, he was appointed professor at the school of [[engineering]] and [[artillery]] in [[Berlin]], but on account of some democratic writings he was dismissed from this office in 1817. He then became connected with various journals until about 1829, when he received an appointment at the [[Altes Museum|royal museum]] in Berlin, with the title of court councillor ({{lang-de|Hofrat}}). He was the founder and secretary of the ''Wissenschaftlicher Kunstverein'' in Berlin.

==Works==
Förster's principal works are:
* ''Beiträge zur neueren Kriegsgeschichte'' (“Contributions to the history of modern wars,” Berlin, 1816)
* ''Grundzüge der Geschichte des preussischen Staates'' (“Essentials of Prussian history,” Berlin, 1818)
* ''Der Feldmarschall Blücher und seine Umgebungen'' (“Field marshal [[Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher|Blücher]] and his surroundings,” Leipzig, 1820)
* ''Friedrich der Grosse, Jugendjahre, Bildung und Geist'' (“[[Frederick the Great]]: Youth, Education and Intellect,” Berlin, 1822)
* ''[[Albrecht von Wallenstein]]'' (Potsdam, 1834)
* ''[[Frederick William I of Prussia|Friedrick Wilhelm I]], König von Preussen'' (Potsdam, 1834-1835)
* ''Die Höfe und Kabinette Europas im 18. Jahrhundert'' (“The courts and ministries of Europe in the 18th century,” Potsdam, 1836-1839)
* ''Leben und Taten Friedrichs des Grossen'' (“Life and deeds of Frederick the Great,” Meissen, 1840-1841)
* ''Wallensteins Prozess'' (Leipzig, 1844)
* ''Preussens Helden in Krieg und Frieden, neuere und neueste preussische Geschichte'' (“Prussia's heroes in war and peace, late and modern Prussian history,” 7 vols., Berlin, 1849-1860). This is a history of Prussia from 1640-1815. The three concluding volumes of this work contain the history of the war of liberation of 1813-1815. This worked provoked severe criticism.

He brought out an edition of [[Hegel]]'s works, adapted several of [[Shakespeare]]'s plays for the theatre, wrote a number of poems and an historical drama, ''Gustav Adolf'' (Berlin, 1832).

Many of his lesser writings were collected and published as ''Kriegslieder, Romanzen, Erzählungen und Legenden'' (“War songs, romances, stories and legends,” Berlin, 1838). The beginning of an autobiography of Förster, edited by H. Kletke, has been published under the title, ''Kunst und Leben'' (“Art and Life,” Berlin, 1873).

'''Gary Schiff''' (born February 3, 1972, as '''Gary J. Schiffhauer''') is an American politician and activist who represented Ward 9 on the [[Minneapolis City Council]]. A member of the [[Minnesota Democratic-Farmer-Labor Party]] (DFL), he was first elected in 2001 and re-elected in 2005 and 2009. Prior to his political career, Schiff was involved with a variety of activist groups and causes ranging from human rights with the [[Human Rights Campaign]], to historic preservation with Save Our [[Cowles Center for Dance and the Performing Arts|Shubert]].

During his city council tenure, Schiff worked to ease ordinances prohibitive to small businesses, especially [[microbreweries]], and strongly advocated against a publicly funded [[U.S. Bank Stadium|stadium]] for the [[Minnesota Vikings]]. In January 2013, Schiff began a campaign for mayor of Minneapolis in the [[2013 Minneapolis mayoral election|2013 election]] but after an unsuccessful DFL endorsement convention, dropped out of the race and backed an opponent (the eventual winner) in mid-June. His third and final term on the City Council ended in January 2014.

Schiff took over as president of the Council on Crime and Justice the following July. A federal audit identified misused grant funds under Schiff's leadership.

==Early life==
Schiff was born Gary J. Schiffhauer&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hudkins|first=Lonnie|title=Reporters' Notebook|newspaper=The Buffalo News|date=March 29, 1989}}&lt;/ref&gt; on February 3, 1972,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Schiff|first1=Gary|title=Join Mark Dayton for Gary Schiff's 40th Birthday Breakfast!|url=https://www.facebook.com/events/141689589284344/|website=Facebook|accessdate=February 3, 2015|date=February 3, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and grew up the youngest of six children in Western New York State.&lt;ref name=notonfence&gt;{{cite news|last=Roper|first=Eric|title=Minneapolis City Council's Schiff: 'Not one to sit on a fence'|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/159508905.html|accessdate=March 17, 2013|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=June 19, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1990, the [[American Civil Liberties Union]] represented Schiff after he graduated from [[Lewiston-Porter Central School District#High school|Lewiston-Porter High School]] in his hometown of [[Youngstown, New York]]. According to ''[[The Buffalo News]]'', Schiff had painted a mural along the school's stairwell that referenced "drugs, safe sex, AIDS and racism" in the style of artist [[Keith Haring]].&lt;ref name=mural&gt;{{cite news|last=Graves|first=Neil|title=Forum Airs Issues in Mural Flap: Ultimate Resolution May Rest With Court|newspaper=Buffalo News|date=September 14, 1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; In September of that year, the school's superintendent, Walter S. Polka, decided that parts of the mural's text were objectionable.&lt;ref name=mural/&gt; The American Civil Liberties Union became involved in an extended legal fight over the constitutionality of Polka's censorship, and a New York Supreme Court Justice sided with the Lewiston-Porter School Board.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Baldwin|first=Richard E.|title=Costs in Mural Dispute Total $24,664: School Board Gets Report on Lew-Port's Legal Fees|newspaper=Buffalo News|date=July 17, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1991, the school board voted 5-1 to paint over the mural. The board cited Schiff's involvement in a recent [[ACT-UP]] demonstration at the school—where demonstrators gave condoms and safe sex literature to students—as a major influence on their decision.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Chrzanowski|first=Ed|title=Lew-Port Board Votes to Paint Out Disputed Mural: Artist's Participation in ACT-UP is Factor|newspaper=Buffalo News|date=July 17, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of a transition that included moving from Youngstown to [[Minneapolis]] to attend college at the [[University of Minnesota]], Schiff shortened his name from the original Schiffhauer as a result of his parents' shame and refusal to acknowledge his sexuality in the small conservative town of Youngstown NY where the family attended church in a conservative Roman Catholic Parish (St. Bernard's, Youngstown, NY).  However, Robert and Rita Schiffhauer, Gary's parents, soon joined the PFLAG Chapter in nearby Buffalo, NY in order to understand and support their son which they continued to do throughout their lives.  Schiff's official public statement is that he shortened his name in an effort to move athe memories of bullying that he said made his youth "an act of survival".&lt;ref name=notonfence /&gt; In October 1992, he and six other students protested against the [[Reserve Officers' Training Corps]] (ROTC) and its compliance with a longstanding ban on homosexuals in the military. The seven protesters interrupted a meeting of the University Board of Regents, demanded the expulsion of the ROTC from campus, and handcuffed themselves to the Regents' chairs. Wearing signs that read "$old," suggesting that their human rights had been traded for Federal grant money, Schiff and the six other students were arrested by University Police and each charged with misdemeanors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Pinney|first=Gregor W.|title=Seven Students Arrested Protesting ROTC Policy at 'U' Regents Meeting|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=October 10, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1993 to 1995, Schiff directed the Progressive Student Leadership Exchange (PLSE), a program modeled on the [[Civil Rights Movement]]'s [[Freedom Summer]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Vaid|first=Urvashi|title=Virtual Equality: The Mainstreaming of Gay and Lesbian Liberation|year=1993|publisher=Anchor Books|location=New York|isbn=0385472994|pages=399–400}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Human Rights Campaign]] (HRC) took interest in the program, and invited Schiff to direct it as the newly named "Youth College for Campaign Training" in Washington, D.C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=HRC Launches First Youth College for Campaign Training|url=https://groups.google.com/group/bit.listserv.gaynet/tree/browse_frm/month/1996-03/b65654372545add4?rnum=101&amp;_done=/group/bit.listserv.gaynet/browse_frm/month/1996-03?&amp;pli=1|publisher=Human Rights Campaign|date=February 29, 1996|accessdate=November 12, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The HRC-funded program invited people aged 18–24 to participate in workshops, and sent the participants to "target states" where they worked in groups as campaign staff members.

==Minneapolis City Council==

Schiff, at the time working as a [[teaching assistant]] in the University of Minnesota's [[Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs]]&lt;ref name=mdmayorannouncement /&gt; on his way to earning a [[master's degree]] in [[urban planning]],&lt;ref name=preservationist /&gt; took a leave of absence to run for a seat on the Minneapolis City Council against Michael Guest and Kathy Thurber in 2001.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Olson|first1=Rochelle|title=Thurber Won't Seek Reelection to Minneapolis City Council|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=February 9, 2001|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-70200750.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; He won unanimous DFL endorsement on September 11, 2001 and, in a race that was overshadowed by the [[2001 terrorist attacks]], he ran against Lucky Rosenbloom, an African-American Republican.&lt;ref name=stribed2001&gt;{{cite news|last=''Star Tribune'' editorial staff|title=Minneapolis City Council|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=October 21, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schiff received the endorsement of the ''[[Star Tribune]]'', which noted his "first-hand knowledge" of [[light rail]] systems in other U.S. cities.&lt;ref name=stribed2001/&gt; Elected by a large majority in November 2001, Schiff became one of seven newly elected members on the 13-member city council, joining two [[Green Party of Minnesota|Green Party]] members, two other openly gay council members, one African-American council member, and four women.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brunswick|first=Mark|title=Minneapolis City Council|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=November 7, 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was sworn into office on December 17, 2001, earlier than his fellow councilmembers, when Thurber resigned from her seat to assume the position of deputy director of [[Perpich Center for Arts Education]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=New face on the City Council|url=http://docs.newsbank.com/openurl?ctx_ver=z39.88-2004&amp;rft_id=info:sid/iw.newsbank.com:AWNB:STMB&amp;rft_val_format=info:ofi/fmt:kev:mtx:ctx&amp;rft_dat=0F07F91B63A0FAC7&amp;svc_dat=InfoWeb:aggregated5&amp;req_dat=0FEAA90C14DCEF00|accessdate=January 9, 2014|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=December 18, 2001}}{{subscription required|via=NewsBank}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===First term (2001–05)===

In his first term, Schiff sponsored and cosponsored numerous legal reforms to the Minneapolis Zoning Code that reduced bureaucratic obstacles for small businesses and housing developers, including a measure that permitted sidewalk cafes to use permanent outdoor furniture&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Nelson|first=Rick|title=Proposal Would Prettify City's Sidewalk Cafes|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=June 28, 2002|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-87934703.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keefe|first=Merry|title=Regular Meeting of August 9, 2002|url=http://www.minneapolismn.gov/www/groups/public/@council/documents/proceedings/wcms1q-069959.pdf|work=Minneapolis City Council Official Proceedings|publisher=City of Minneapolis|accessdate=March 24, 2013|pages=683–684|format=PDF|date=November 5, 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a change in city zoning code that facilitated the construction of denser and more affordable housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Minneapolis City Council: Bonuses to Boost Housing Approved, Higher Density, More Low-Cost Units Sought|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=November 23, 2002|first1=Kevin |last1=Duchscher|first2=Rochelle|last2= Olson}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Keefe|first=Merry|title=Regular Meeting of November 22, 2002|url=http://www.minneapolismn.gov/www/groups/public/@council/documents/proceedings/wcms1q-069967.pdf|work=Minneapolis City Council Official Proceedings|publisher=City of Minneapolis|accessdate=March 24, 2013|pages=1153–1157|format=PDF|date=April 28, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also sponsored an ordinance to add domestic partnerships to the Zoning Code's definition of "family" in terms of housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ristuben|first=Steven J.|title=Regular Meeting of December 13, 2002|url=http://www.minneapolismn.gov/www/groups/public/@council/documents/proceedings/wcms1q-069970.pdf|work=Minneapolis City Council Official Proceedings|publisher=City of Minneapolis|accessdate=March 23, 2013|pages=1204–1205|format=PDF|date=January 30, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, with colleagues Barbara Johnson and Sandy Colvin Roy, Schiff developed a last-minute plan to restore $2 million in proposed cuts to the Minneapolis [[Minneapolis Fire Department|Fire]] and [[Minneapolis Police Department|Police]] Departments, following a $26 million cut from Local Government Aid by former Governor [[Tim Pawlenty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Olson|first1=Rochelle|title=Some Fire, Police Jobs Spared: In Adjusting and Approving Budget Cuts, the Minneapolis City Council Finds a Way to Save Positions|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=March 4, 2003|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-98778769.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; That same year, he sponsored an ordinance that effectively blocked police officers, city inspectors, and other city employees from inquiring about a resident's immigration status. The ordinance forbids police officers from arresting a suspect solely on the grounds of a suspected immigration status violation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brandt|first=Steve|title=Minneapolis OKs Rule on Immigrants: City Employees are Now Limited in What They Can Do to Turn People in for Possible Immigration Violations|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=July 12, 2003|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-105642078.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Second term (2005–09)===

In July 2004, the Minneapolis City Council passed a ban on indoor smoking in bars, restaurants, pool halls, and bowling alleys by a 12-1 margin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Scheck|first=Tom|title=Minneapolis City Council Passes Smoking Ban|publisher=Minnesota Public Radio|url=http://news.minnesota.publicradio.org/features/2004/07/23_scheckt_mplssmokeban/|date=July 23, 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2005, the ban took effect alongside other indoor smoking bans passed by other cities in the [[Minneapolis-St. Paul metropolitan area]].&lt;ref name=Stellar&gt;{{cite news|last=Stellar|first=Chris|title=Ward Nine: Schiff, Bicking Vie Again|newspaper=Minnesota Independent|date=September 7, 2009|url=http://minnesotaindependent.com/43772/ward-nine-schiff-bicking-eberhardy|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111218235042/http://minnesotaindependent.com/43772/ward-nine-schiff-bicking-eberhardy|archivedate=December 18, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, during the [[Minneapolis municipal elections, 2005|2005 Minneapolis City Council elections]], a write-in candidate named Dave Shegstad received 10 percent of the ninth ward vote under a "Smoke Out Gary" campaign slogan—a reference to Schiff's role as a co-author of the smoking ban. 59 percent of voters re-elected Schiff to a second term; his main opponent, Green Party candidate David Bicking, won 30 percent of the vote.&lt;ref name=Stellar/&gt;

In 2006, Schiff sponsored eliminating a cap on taxi licenses in Minneapolis. The move angered some local taxi drivers, who noted that an attending increase in licenses would lead to greater competition in the local taxicab business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Giles|first=Kevin|title=Hailing, Howling Follow New Cab Rules: Everyone Agrees that Minneapolis' New Taxi Ordinance Will Mean Changes|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=October 10, 2006|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-152597171.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; The City Council passed the cap lift, and the number of Minneapolis taxis doubled between 2010 and 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Roper|first=Eric|title=A Bumper-to-Bumper Crop of Cabs|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=May 9, 2012|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/150704145.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Beginning in 2008, Schiff and other city leaders contended with local ramifications of the [[2008-2012 global recession]], which included spate of foreclosures in economically distressed neighborhoods. In April 2008, the city council approved a pilot mortgage assistance program called Minneapolis Advantage. The program, which passed the council 10-2, offered [[forgivable loan]]s to homebuyers who were interested in properties on the same block as foreclosed or city-owned properties within targeted neighborhoods.&lt;ref name=Brandt&gt;{{cite news|last=Brandt|first=Steve|title=Minneapolis City Council authorized a pilot loan program Friday to try to prop up foreclosure-sapped neighborhoods|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=April 5, 2008|url=http://www.highbeam.com/doc/1G1-177693282.html}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schiff argued that the initiative was not targeted enough to have the designed effect and voted against it, along with fellow councilmember Paul Ostrow.&lt;ref name=Brandt/&gt;

The city also strictly regulated non-motorized [[pedicab]]s; it first permitted the bicycle-powered taxis in 1984, but there were no active pedicab licenses in the city by 2008.&lt;ref name=Pease&gt;{{cite news|last=Pease|first=Steve|title=Greasing the Wheels: Pedicab Hours Expanded|newspaper=Downtown Journal|date=September 8, 2008|url=http://www.journalmpls.com/node/12265|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130411045113/http://www.journalmpls.com/node/12265|archivedate=April 11, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schiff proposed eliminating some restrictions, and the city council passed ordinances allowing pedicabs to operate on downtown streets, downtown bridges, and on the Nicollet Mall, at any time except the morning and evening rush hours.&lt;ref name=Pease/&gt; In October 2011, when the city permitted pedicabs to operate during rush hours (with new safety regulations), eight licensed pedicab companies operated forty cabs in the downtown area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Brandt|first=Steve|title=Keeping Tabs on Pedicabs|newspaper= Star Tribune|date=October 9, 2011|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/131431988.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Third term (2009–13)===
[[File:Gary Schiff 2009 Ward 9 Candidate Forum.png|thumb|left|Gary Schiff speaking at a Ward 9 candidate forum in 2009]]
In February 2012, a reporter for the ''[[Minnesota Daily]]'' wrote that Schiff is "possibly the most active and popular City Council member" and noted that 60 percent of Ward 9 voters reelected him to a third term in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sudheimer|first=Nick|title=Map Would Pit Ward 2’s Cam Gordon against Fellow Councilman: The Green Party is Concerned About the Proposed Map|newspaper=Minnesota Daily|date=February 20, 2012|url=http://www.mndaily.com/2012/02/20/map-would-pit-ward-2%E2%80%99s-cam-gordon-against-fellow-councilman}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mayoral bid (2013)==
[[File:Gary Schiff, 2013 DFL convention.jpg|thumb|right|Schiff addressing the ill-fated DFL endorsement convention on June 15, 2013]]
Schiff had been considering running for mayor of Minneapolis in the [[2013 Minneapolis mayoral election]] as early as June 2012, and stated that his ultimate decision would not be contingent upon whether mayor [[R.T. Rybak]] opted to run for another term.&lt;ref name=notonfence /&gt; Speaking from the Harriet Brewing tap room on January 29, 2013, Schiff announced his official candidacy for the position.&lt;ref name=stribmayorannouncement /&gt; On the same day, he also held an event in the [[Dinkytown]] area near the University of Minnesota with rapper [[Brother Ali]] to kick off his campaign.&lt;ref name=mdmayorannouncement /&gt; Schiff was the second City Councilmember to announce his candidacy after [[Betsy Hodges]] of Ward 13,&lt;ref name=stribmayorannouncement /&gt; and Don Samuels of Ward 5 announced his candidacy later.&lt;ref name=mdmayorannouncement /&gt;

The University of Minnesota's [[Hubert H. Humphrey School of Public Affairs]] hosted the first mayoral debate on March 27, with Schiff among the five declared candidates who were seeking the DFL nomination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Boros|first=Karen|title=First Minneapolis mayoral debate ranges from public safety to Vikings stadium|url=http://www.minnpost.com/two-cities/2013/03/first-minneapolis-mayoral-debate-ranges-public-safety-vikings-stadium|accessdate=June 16, 2013|newspaper=MinnPost|date=March 28, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A week later, on April 4, Schiff took part in the city's second mayoral debate, this time located at a [[Kingfield, Minneapolis|Kingfield]]-neighborhood church.&lt;ref name=debate2&gt;{{cite news|last=Halter|first=Nick|title=Garbage burning, upbringing hot topics in second mayoral debate|url=http://www.southwestjournal.com/news/2013-city-election/garbage-burning-upbringing-hot-topics-in-second-mayoral-debate|accessdate=June 16, 2013|newspaper=[[Southwest Journal]]|date=April 4, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130715045034/http://www.southwestjournal.com/news/2013-city-election/garbage-burning-upbringing-hot-topics-in-second-mayoral-debate|archivedate=July 15, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the proceedings, he pledged that he would abide by the DFL's endorsement, making him the sole candidate to vow so among the five candidates seeking the endorsement at the time.&lt;ref name=debate2 /&gt; Schiff also participated in the city's first mayoral debate dealing specifically with issues concerning Minneapolis's [[Somali American|Somali population]], an event that took place on May 31 and was hosted at a Somali restaurant on [[Lake Street (Minneapolis)|Lake Street]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rao|first=Maya|title=Minneapolis mayoral candidates mix it up in bid to woo Somali votes|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/minneapolis/209763281.html?page=all&amp;prepage=1&amp;c=y#continue|accessdate=June 16, 2013|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=June 1, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Schiff received endorsements from the Minneapolis Firefighters Union,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Willms|first=Jan|title=Gary Schiff throws his hat into Mayoral race in Minneapolis|url=http://www.longfellownokomismessenger.com/gary-schiff-throws-his-hat-into-mayoral-race-in-minneapolis/|accessdate=June 16, 2013|newspaper=Longfellow/Nokomis Messenger|date=February 27, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Minnesota House of Representatives|state representative]] [[Karen Clark]],&lt;ref name=qanda&gt;{{cite news|last=Boros|first=Karen|title=Minneapolis mayoral candidate Gary Schiff Q-A: 'Every neighborhood should make progress'|url=http://www.minnpost.com/politics-policy/2013/04/minneapolis-mayoral-candidate-gary-schiff-q-every-neighborhood-should-make-p|accessdate=June 16, 2013|newspaper=MinnPost|date=April 3, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and former Vikings punter [[Chris Kluwe]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Rao|first=Maya|title=Former Viking Chris Kluwe endorses Schiff for mayor|url=http://www.startribune.com/local/blogs/209569301.html|accessdate=June 16, 2013|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=May 30, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; among others.&lt;ref name=qanda /&gt;

At the DFL endorsement convention, Schiff came in third place behind [[Mark Andrew (politician)|Mark Andrew]] and Hodges during the first two rounds of voting but was denied a place on the third round ballot after failing to meet a minimum vote threshold during round two.&lt;ref name=wideopen&gt;{{cite news|last=Rao|first=Maya|title=Mpls. mayoral race wide open after no one wins DFL endorsement|url=http://www.startribune.com/politics/statelocal/211698671.html?page=all&amp;prepage=1&amp;c=y#continue|accessdate=June 16, 2013|newspaper=Star Tribune|date=June 15, 2013|first2=Eric|last2=Roper}}&lt;/ref&gt; When Schiff backed Hodges with the intention, according to the ''Star Tribune'', of preventing Andrew from receiving the 60% of votes needed to win the endorsement, he lost the support of the Minneapolis Firefighters Union.&lt;ref name=wideopen /&gt; The convention concluded with no winner and, because no one was endorsed, Schiff stated that he would remain in the race.&lt;ref name=wideopen /&gt; His campaign manager, Mark Warren, left Schiff's campaign shortly after the convention&lt;ref name="loses campaign manager"&gt;{{cite news|last=Mannix|first=Andy|title=Gary Schiff loses campaign manager, fire department endorsement|url=http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2013/06/mpls_fire_dept_union_explains_pulling_schiff_endorsement.php|accessdate=September 24, 2013|newspaper=City Pages|date=June 17, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927055520/http://blogs.citypages.com/blotter/2013/06/mpls_fire_dept_union_explains_pulling_schiff_endorsement.php|archivedate=September 27, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a few days later, he declared an end to his bid for mayor and announced that he would campaign actively for Hodges.&lt;ref name="schiff drops out"&gt;{{cite news|last=McKenzie|first=Sarah|title=Schiff drops out of mayoral race, backs Hodges|url=http://www.southwestjournal.com/news/2013-city-election/schiff-drops-out-of-mayoral-race-backs-hodges|accessdate=June 19, 2013|newspaper=Southwest Journal|date=June 19, 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130816020400/http://www.southwestjournal.com/news/2013-city-election/schiff-drops-out-of-mayoral-race-backs-hodges|archivedate=August 16, 2013|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Gilla in Chomded was a [[poet]], [[scribe]] and [[scholar]] at the [[monastery]] of [[Tulach Léis]] (Tullylisk, [[County Down]]).

He authored the poem ''A Rí richid, réidig dam'', which has received extensive scholarly attention since the 19th century but still lacks a critical edition. It survives in the [[Book of Leinster]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Trinity College, Dublin|TCD]] MS 1339, previously H.2.18&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Aimirgin Glúngel tuir tend]]'' is another surviving poem credited to him.

[[File:Horned God.JPG|thumb|A sculpture of the Horned God Bucca of Cornish traditional witchcraft, found in the [[Museum of Witchcraft]] in [[Boscastle]], [[Cornwall]].]]

The '''Horned God''' is one of the two primary deities found in [[Wicca]] and some related forms of [[Neopaganism]]. 
The term ''Horned God'' itself predates Wicca, and is an early 20th-century [[syncretism|syncretic]] term for a horned or antlered anthropomorphic god with partly [[pseudohistorical]] origins, partly based on historical [[Horned deity|horned deities]].&lt;ref&gt;Michael D. Bailey ''Witchcraft Historiography (review)'' in Magic, Ritual, and Witchcraft - Volume 3, Number 1, Summer 2008, pp. 81-85&lt;/ref&gt;

The Horned God represents the [[God (Wicca)|male part]] of the religion's [[Wiccan ditheism|duotheistic theological system]], the [[Prince consort|consort]] of the female [[Triple Goddess (Neopaganism)|Triple Goddess]] of the Moon or other [[Mother Goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.druidry.org/library/gods-goddesses/horned-god-unofficial-autobiography |title=from the library of the Order of Bards, Ovates &amp; Druids |publisher=Druidry.org |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In common Wiccan belief, he is associated with nature, wilderness, sexuality, hunting, and the life cycle.&lt;ref name=farrargod&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Witches' God: Lord of the Dance |publisher=Robert Hale |location=London |first=Janet |last=Farrar |author2=Farrar, Stewart |year=1989 |pages= |isbn=0-7090-3319-2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|32–34}} Whilst depictions of the deity vary, he is always shown with either [[horn (anatomy)|horn]]s or [[antler]]s upon his head, often depicted as being [[Theriocephaly|theriocephalic]] (having a beast's head), in this way emphasizing "the union of the divine and the animal", the latter of which includes [[human]]ity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Horns of Power |publisher=Avalonia |location=London |first=Sorita |last=d'Este |year=2008 |pages=|isbn=1-905297-17-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|11}}

In traditional Wicca ([[British Traditional Wicca]]), he is generally regarded as a [[Dualistic cosmology|dualistic]] god of twofold aspects: bright and dark, night and day,  summer and winter,  the Oak King and the [[Holly King (archetype)|Holly King]].  In this dualistic view, his two horns symbolize, in part, his dual nature.  (The use of horns to symbolize duality is also reflected in the phrase "on the horns of a dilemma.") The three aspects of the Goddess and the two aspects of the Horned God are sometimes mapped on to the five points of the [[Pentagram]],  although which points correspond  to which deity aspects  varies. In some other systems, he is represented as a [[triple deities|triune]] [[god]], split into three aspects that reflect those of the Triple Goddess: the [[wikt:youth|Youth]] ([[Warrior]]), the [[wikt:father|Father]], and the [[Sage (philosophy)|Sage]].

The Horned God has been explored within several [[psychology|psychological]] theories and has become a recurrent theme in [[fantasy]] literature.&lt;ref name="encyclopedia_of_fantasy"&gt;

==In Wicca==
[[File:Gundestrup Cernunnos.jpg|thumb|The "Cernunnos" type antlered figure on the [[Gundestrup Cauldron]]]]

In traditional and mainstream Wicca, the Horned God is viewed as the divine male principality, being both equal and opposite to the Goddess. The Wiccan god himself can be represented in many forms, including as the [[Solar deity|Sun God]], the Sacrificed God and the Vegetation God,&lt;ref name="farrargod"/&gt; although the Horned God is the most popular representation. The pioneers of the various Wiccan or Witchcraft traditions, such as [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], [[Doreen Valiente]] and [[Roy Bowers|Robert Cochrane]], all claimed that their religion was a continuation of the [[Paganism|pagan]] religion of the [[Witch-Cult]] following historians who had purported the Witch-Cult's existence, such as [[Jules Michelet]] and [[Margaret Murray]].

For Wiccans, the Horned God is "the personification of the life force energy in animals and the wild"&lt;ref&gt;"Starhawk" in News-Week On-faith [http://newsweek.washingtonpost.com/onfaith/starhawk/2006/11/some_basic_definitions.html Some basic definitions] 2006&lt;/ref&gt; and is associated with [[Lord of the animals|the wilderness]], virility and [[Hunting God|the hunt]].&lt;ref name="Davy"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|16}} [[Doreen Valiente]] writes that the Horned God also [[Psychopomp|carries the souls of the dead to the underworld]].&lt;ref name="Greenwood"/&gt;

Wiccans generally, as well as some other neopagans, tend to conceive of the universe as polarized into gender opposites of [[masculinity|male]] and [[femininity|female]] [[Energy (esotericism)|energies]]. In traditional Wicca, the Horned God and the Goddess are seen as equal and opposite in gender polarity. However, in some of the newer traditions of Wicca, and especially those influenced by feminist ideology, there is more emphasis on the Goddess, and consequently the symbolism of the Horned God is less developed than that of the [[Goddess (Wicca)|Goddess]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

In Wicca the cycle of the seasons is celebrated during eight sabbats called The [[Wheel of the Year]]. The seasonal cycle is imagined to follow the relationship between the Horned God and the Goddess.&lt;ref name="Davy" /&gt; The Horned God is born in winter, impregnates the Goddess and then dies during the autumn and winter months and is then reborn by the Goddess at Yule.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; The different relationships throughout the year are sometimes distinguished by splitting the god into aspects, the Oak King and the Holly King.&lt;ref name="Davy" /&gt; The relationships between the Goddess and the Horned God are mirrored by Wiccans in seasonal rituals. There is some variation between Wiccan groups as to which sabbat corresponds to which part of the cycle. Some Wiccans regard the Horned God as dying at Lammas, August 1; also known as Lughnasadh, which is the first harvest sabbat. Others may see him dying at Mabon, the [[autumn equinox]], or the second harvest festival. Still other Wiccans conceive of the Horned God dying on October 31, which Wiccans call [[Samhain]], the ritual of which is focused on death. He is then reborn on Winter Solstice, December 21.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|28}} [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]] says (in 1959's ''[[The Meaning of Witchcraft]]'') that The Horned God is an Under-god, a mediator between an unknowable supreme deity and the people. (In Wiccan liturgy in the Book of Shadows, this conception of an unknowable supreme deity is referred to as "Dryghtyn." It is not a personal god, but rather an impersonal divinity similar to the Tao of Taoism.)

Whilst the Horned God is the most common depiction of masculine divinity in Wicca, he is not the only representation. Other examples include the [[Green Man]] and the [[solar deity|Sun God]].&lt;ref name=farrargod/&gt; In traditional Wicca, however, these other representations of the Wiccan god are subsumed or amalgamated into the Horned God, as aspects or expressions of him. Sometimes this is shown by adding horns or antlers to the iconography. The Green Man, for example, may be shown with branches resembling antlers; and the Sun God may be depicted with a crown or halo of solar rays, that may resemble horns. These other conceptions of the Wiccan god should not be regarded as displacing the Horned God, but rather as elaborating on various facets of his nature. Doreen Valiente has called the Horned God "the eldest of gods" in both The Witches Creed and also in her Invocation To The Horned God.

Wiccans believe that The Horned God, as Lord of Death, is their "comforter and consoler" after death and before reincarnation; and that he rules the [[Underworld]] or [[The Summerland|Summerland]] where the souls of the dead reside as they await rebirth. Some, such as Joanne Pearson, believe that this is based on the [[Mesopotamian]] myth of [[Inanna]]'s [[Inanna#Inanna's descent to the underworld|descent into the underworld]], though this has not been confirmed.&lt;ref&gt;

===Names===
[[File:Horned God and Mother Goddess (Doreen Valiente's Altar).jpg|thumb|right|Altar statues of the Horned God and Mother Goddess crafted by Bel Bucca and owned by the "Mother of Wicca", [[Doreen Valiente]]]]

[[Doreen Valiente]], a former High Priestess of the [[Gardnerian Wicca|Gardnerian tradition]], claimed that Gerald Gardner's [[Bricket Wood coven]] referred to the god as [[Cernunnos]], or '''Kernunno''', which is a Latin word, discovered on a [[pillar of the Boatmen|stone carving found in France]], meaning "the Horned One". Valiente claimed that the coven also referred to the god as '''Janicot''',{{needs IPA}} which she theorised was of [[Basque language|Basque]] origin, and Gardner also used this name in his novel ''High Magic's Aid''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Rebirth of Witchcraft |publisher=Robert Hale Ltd |first=Doreen |last=Valiente |year=2007 |pages= |isbn=0-7090-8369-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|52–53}}

[[Stewart Farrar]], a High Priest of the [[Alexandrian Wicca|Alexandrian tradition]] referred to the Horned God as Karnayna, which he believed was a corruption of the word Cernunnos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |title=What Witches Do |publisher=Robert Hale Ltd |first=Stewart |last=Farrar |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=0-7090-9014-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The historian [[Ronald Hutton]] has suggested that it instead came from the Arabic term [[Dhul-Qarnayn]] which meant "Horned One". This term had been used in the [[Quran|Qur'an]] to refer to [[Cyrus the Great]] or alternatively [[Alexander the Great]], who considered himself the son of the horned deity Ammon-Zeus, and wore horns as a part of his regalia. Margaret Murray had mentioned this information in her 1933 book ''The God of the Witches'', and Hutton theorised that [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex Sanders]] had taken it from there, enjoying the fact that he shared his name with the ancient Macedonian emperor.&lt;ref name="triumph"&gt;{{Cite book |title=The Triumph of the Moon: a History of Modern Pagan Witchcaraft |publisher=Oxford Paperbacks |first=Ronald |last=Hutton |year=1995 |pages= |isbn=0-19-285449-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|331}}

In the writings of [[Charles Cardell]] and [[Raymond Howard (Wiccan)|Raymond Howard]], the god was referred to as '''Atho'''. Howard had a wooden statue of Atho's head which he claimed was 2200 years old, but the statue was stolen in April 1967. Howard's son later admitted that his father had carved the statue himself.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thewica.co.uk/coven_of_atho%20article.htm#_ednref22 |title=The Coven of Atho |publisher=Thewica.co.uk |accessdate=2014-02-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6Z8swU6zn?url=http://www.thewica.co.uk/coven_of_atho%20article.htm |archivedate=2015-06-08 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Cochrane's Craft]], which was founded by [[Robert Cochrane (witch)|Robert Cochrane]], the Horned God was often referred to by a Biblical name; [[Tubal-cain]], who, according to the [[Bible]] was the first blacksmith.&lt;ref name="Roebuck"&gt;{{Cite book |first=Mike |last=Howard |title=The Roebuck in the Thicket: An Anthology of the Robert Cochrane Witchcraft Tradition |publisher=Capall Bann Publishing |isbn=1-86163-155-3 |year=2001 }} Chapter One.&lt;/ref&gt; In this neopagan concept, the god is also referred to as [[Brân the Blessed|Brân]], a Welsh mythological figure, [[Wayland the Smith|Wayland]], the smith in Germanic mythology, and [[Herne the Hunter|Herne]], a horned figure from [[English folklore]].&lt;ref name="Roebuck"/&gt;

In the neopagan tradition of [[Stregheria]], founded by [[Raven Grimassi]] and loosely inspired by the works of [[Charles Godfrey Leland]], the Horned God goes by several names, including [[Janus|Dianus]], [[Faunus]], Cern, and [[Actaeon]].{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}

==In psychology==

===Jungian analysis===
[[File:Gehörnter Gott, Enkomi.jpg|thumb|upright|Bronze figurine of a "Horned God" from [[Enkomi]], Cyprus]]

Sherry Salman considers the image of the Horned God in [[Jungian]] terms, as an archetypal protector and mediator of the outside world to the objective psyche. In her theory the male psyche's 'Horned God' frequently compensates for inadequate fathering.

When first encountered, the figure is a dangerous, 'hairy chthonic wildman' possessed of kindness and intelligence. If [[psychological repression|repressed]], later in life The Horned God appears as the lord of the Otherworld, or [[Hades]]. If split off entirely, he leads to violence, substance abuse and sexual perversion. When integrated he gives the male an ego 'in possession of its own destructiveness' and for the female psyche gives an effective [[anima and animus|animus]] relating to both the physical body and the psyche.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

In considering the Horned God as a symbol recurring in women's literature, Richard Sugg suggests the Horned God represents the 'natural Eros', a masculine lover subjugating the social-conformist nature of the female shadow, thus encompassing a combination of the [[Shadow (psychology)|shadow]] and animus. One such example is [[Heathcliff (Wuthering Heights)|Heathcliff]] from [[Emily Brontë]]'s ''[[Wuthering Heights]]''. Sugg goes on to note that female characters who are paired with this character usually end up socially ostracised, or worse &amp;ndash; in an inverted ending to the male hero-story.&lt;ref&gt;

[[horned deity|Many horned deities]] are known to have been worshipped in various cultures throughout history. Evidence for horned gods appear very early in the human record.  The so-called [[The Sorcerer (cave art)|Sorcerer]] dates from perhaps 13,000 BCE.  Twenty-one red deer headdresses, made from the skulls of the [[red deer]] and likely fitted with leather laces, have been uncovered at the Mesolithic site of [[Star Carr]].  They are thought to date from roughly 9,000 BCE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.teachinghistory100.org/objects/about_the_object/mesolithic_headdress |title=British Museum headdresses |website= |publisher=Trustees of the British Museum |access-date=2018-01-17 |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Several theories have been created to establish historical roots for modern [[Neopagan]] worship of a Horned God.

&lt;/ref&gt; and others, [[Margaret Murray]], in her 1921 book ''[[The Witch-Cult in Western Europe]]'', proposed the theory that the witches of the early-modern period were remnants of a pagan cult and that the Christian Church had declared the god of the witches was in fact [[the Devil]]. Without recourse to any specific representation of this deity, Murray speculates that the head coverings common in [[inquisition]]-derived descriptions of the devil "may throw light on one of the possible origins of the cult."&lt;ref name="MurrayWitch"&gt;{{Cite book|authorlink=Margaret Murray |last=Murray |first=Margaret |title=The Witch-cult in Western Europe (1921)|year=2006|publisher=Standard Publications|isbn=1-59462-126-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Nejamesa horned god of India.png|thumb|left|Horned God [[Naigamesha]] of the Indian sub-religion [[Kaumaram]]. Possibly from the Shunga period (1st-2nd century B.C), or earlier]]
In 1931 Murray published a sequel, ''The God of the Witches'', which tries to gather evidence in support of her witch-cult theory. In Chapter 1 "The Horned God".&lt;ref name="MurraGod"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Murray |first=Margaret |title=The God of the Witches (1931)|year=1970|isbn=0-19-501270-4|publisher=OUA USA}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murray claims that various depictions of humans with horns from [[Europe]]an and [[India]]n sources, ranging from the [[paleolithic]] French cave painting of "[[The Sorcerer (cave art)|The Sorcerer]]" to the Indic [[Pashupati]] to the modern English [[Dorset Ooser]], are evidence for an unbroken, Europe-wide tradition of worship of a singular Horned God. Murray derived this model of a horned god cult from [[James Frazer]] and [[Jules Michelet]].&lt;ref&gt;

In dealing with "[[The Sorcerer (cave art)|The Sorcerer]]",&lt;ref name=MurrayWitch/&gt;{{rp|23–4}} the earliest evidence claimed, Murray based her observations on a drawing by [[Henri Breuil]], which some modern scholars such as Ronald Hutton claim is inaccurate. Hutton states that modern photographs show the original cave art lacks horns, a human torso or any other significant detail on its upper half.&lt;ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|34}}  However, others, such as celebrated prehistorian [[Jean Clottes]], assert that Breuil's sketch is indeed accurate.  Clottes stated that "I have seen it myself perhaps 20 times over the years".&lt;ref name="Cave Art Cobblers?"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.strangehistory.net/2011/07/06/cave-art-cobblers/|title=Cave Art Cobblers? - Beachcombing's Bizarre History Blog|date=6 July 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Breuil considered his drawing to represent a shaman or magician - an interpretation which gives the image its name. Murray having seen the drawing called Breuil's image "the first depiction of a deity", an idea which Breuil and others later adopted.

Murray also used an inaccurate drawing of a [[mesolithic]] rock-painting at [[El Cogul|Cogul]] in northeast Spain as evidence of group religious ceremony of the cult, although the central male figure is not horned.&lt;ref name=MurrayWitch/&gt;{{rp|65}} The illustration she used of the Cogul painting leaves out a number of figures, human and animal, and the original is more likely a sequence of superimposed but unrelated illustrations, rather than a depiction of a single scene.&lt;ref name=triumph/&gt;{{rp|197}}

Despite widespread criticism of Murray's scholarship some minor aspects of her work continued to have supporters.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last=Ginzburg |first=Carlo |authorlink=Carlo Ginzburg |title=Ecstasies: Deciphering the Witches' Sabbath}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|9}}&lt;ref&gt;"Other historians, like Byloff and Bonomo, have been willing to build upon the useful aspects of Murray's work without adopting its untenable elements, and the independent and careful researches of contemporary scholars have lent aspects of the Murray thesis considerable new strength." — J. B. Russell (1972) ''Witchcraft in the Middle Ages''. Cornell University Press. p.37.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Influences from literature====
The popular image of the Greek god [[Pan (god)|Pan]] was removed from its classical context in the writings of the [[Romantics]] of the 18th century and connected with their ideals of a pastoral England. This, along with the general public's increasing lack of familiarity of [[Greek mythology]] at the time led to the figure of Pan becoming generalised as a 'horned god', and applying connotations to the character, such as benevolence that were not evident in the original Greek myths which in turn gave rise to the popular acceptance of Murray's hypothetical horned god of the witches.&lt;ref name=triumph/&gt;

{{Main|Aradia, or the Gospel of the Witches#Influence on Wicca and Stregheria}}
The reception of ''Aradia'' amongst Neopagans has not been entirely positive. Clifton suggests that modern claims of revealing an Italian pagan witchcraft tradition, for example those of [[Leo Martello]] and [[Raven Grimassi]], must be "match[ed] against", and compared with the claims in ''Aradia''. He further suggests that a lack of comfort with ''Aradia'' may be due to an "insecurity" within Neopaganism about the movement's claim to authenticity as a religious revival.&lt;ref name="Clifton"&gt;

Valiente offers another explanation for the negative reaction of some neopagans; that the identification of [[Lucifer]] as the god of the witches in ''Aradia'' was "too strong meat" for Wiccans who were used to the gentler, romantic paganism of Gerald Gardner and were especially quick to reject any relationship between witchcraft and [[Satanism]].&lt;ref name="Valiente61"&gt;[[Doreen Valiente|Valiente, Doreen]], quoted in Clifton, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{main|Witch-cult hypothesis#Post-Murray}}
In 1985 Classical historian [[Georg Luck]], in his ''Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds'', theorised that the origins of the Witch-cult may have appeared in late antiquity as a faith primarily designed to worship the Horned God, stemming from the merging of [[Cernunnos]], a horned god of the Celts, with the Greco-Roman [[Pan (god)|Pan]]/[[Faunus]],&lt;ref name="LuckArcana" /&gt; a combination of gods which he posits created a new deity, around which the remaining [[pagan]]s, those refusing to convert to Christianity, rallied and that this deity provided the prototype for later Christian conceptions of the [[Devil]], and his worshippers were cast by the Church as witches.&lt;ref name="LuckArcana" /&gt;

====Influences from occultism====
[[Image:Baphomet.png|thumb|upright|The 19th century image of a Sabbatic Goat, created by [[Eliphas Levi|Eliphas Lévi]]. Baphomet serves as an historical model for Murray's concept.]]

Eliphas Levi's image of "[[Baphomet]]" serves as an example of the transformation of the Devil into a benevolent fertility deity and provided the prototype for Murray's horned god.&lt;ref name="Wood"/&gt; Murray's central thesis that images of the Devil were actually of [[deities]] and that [[Christianity]] had demonised these worshippers as following [[Satan]], is first recorded in the work of Levi in the fashionable 19th-century [[Occult]]ist circles of England and France.&lt;ref name="Wood"&gt;Juliette Wood, "[http://www.juliettewood.com/papers/Tarot.pdf The Celtic Tarot and the Secret Traditions: A Study in Modern Legend Making]": ''Folklore'', Vol. 109, 1998&lt;/ref&gt;  Levi created his image of Baphomet, published in his ''[[Dogme et Rituel de la Haute Magie]]'' (1855), by combining symbolism from diverse traditions, including the ''[[The Devil (Tarot card)|Diable]]'' card of the 16th and 17th century [[Tarot of Marseille]]. Lévi called his image "The Goat of Mendes", possibly following [[Herodotus]]' account&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'' ii. 42, 46 and 166.&lt;/ref&gt; that the god of Mendes—the Greek name for Djedet, Egypt—was depicted with a goat's face and legs.  Herodotus relates how all male goats were held in great reverence by the Mendesians, and how in his time a woman publicly [[Zoophilia|copulated with a goat]].&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''Histories'' ii. 46. [[Plutarch]] specifically associates [[Osiris]] with the "goat at Mendes." [http://www.sacred-texts.com/gno/th1/th140.htm ''De Iside et Osiride'', lxxiii.]&lt;/ref&gt; [[E. A. Wallis Budge]] writes,

{{quote|At several places in the Delta, e.g. Hermopolis, Lycopolis, and Mendes, the god Pan and a goat were worshipped; Strabo, quoting (xvii. 1, 19) Pindar, says that in these places goats had intercourse with women, and Herodotus (ii. 46) instances a case which was said to have taken place in the open day. The Mendisians, according to this last writer, paid reverence to all goats, and more to the males than to the females, and particularly to one he-goat, on the death of which public mourning is observed throughout the whole Mendesian district; they call both Pan and the goat Mendes, and both were worshipped as gods of generation and fecundity. Diodorus ([http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/E/Roman/Texts/Diodorus_Siculus/1D*.html#ref32 i. 88]) compares the cult of the goat of Mendes with that of Priapus, and groups the god with the Pans and the Satyrs. The goat referred to by all these writers is the famous Mendean Ram, or Ram of Mendes, the cult of which was, according to Manetho, established by Kakau, the king of the IInd dynasty.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6SBLAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA353|title=The Gods of the Egyptians: Or, Studies in Egyptian Mythology|first=Sir Ernest Alfred Wallis|last=Budge|date=28 July 2018|publisher=Methuen &amp; Company|via=Google Books}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Historically, the deity that was venerated at Egyptian Mendes was a ram deity [[Banebdjedet]] (literally Ba of the lord of djed, and titled "the Lord of Mendes"), who was the soul of [[Osiris]]. Lévi combined the images of the Tarot of Marseilles Devil card and refigured the ram ''Banebdjed'' as a he-goat, further imagined by him as "copulator in Anep and inseminator in the district of Mendes".

===Gerald Gardner and Wicca===
[[Margaret Murray]]'s theory of the historical origins of the Horned God has been used by Wiccans to create a myth of historical origins for their religion.&lt;ref name="Davy"/&gt;{{rp|110}}  There is no verifiable evidence to support claims that the religion originates earlier than the mid-20th century.&lt;ref name="triumph"/&gt;

{{Main|Wicca#Theology}}
Modern scholarship has disproved Margaret Murray's theory, however various horned gods and mother goddesses were indeed worshipped in the British Isles during the ancient and early Medieval periods.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Pagan Religions of the Ancient British Isles |publisher=Blackwell |location= |first=Ronald |last=Hutton |year=1991 |pages=260–261 |isbn=0-631-17288-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The "father of Wicca", [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], who adopted Margaret Murray's thesis, claimed Wicca was a modern survival of an ancient pan-European pagan religion.&lt;ref name="NatureRelToday"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rLYCOOUlsBcC&amp;pg=PA6#PPA6,M1 |title=Nature Religion Today: Paganism in the Modern World |first=Joanne |last=Pearson |author2=Roberts, Richard H |author3=Samuel, Geoffrey  |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |location=Edinburgh |page=172 |date=December 1998 |isbn=0-7486-1057-X |oclc=39533917}}&lt;/ref&gt; Gardner states that he had reconstructed elements of the religion from fragments, incorporating elements from [[Freemasonry]], the [[Occult]], and [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]], which came together in the [[Hermetic Order of the Golden Dawn]], where Gardner met [[Aleister Crowley]], whose influence became the basis for Wiccan magical practices.&lt;ref&gt;

Gerald Gardner was initiated into [[Ordo Templi Orientis|the O.T.O.]] by Aleister Crowley and subsequently went on to found the Neopagan religion of Wicca. Various scholars on early Wiccan history, such as [[Ronald Hutton]], [[Philip Heselton]], and [[Leo Ruickbie]] concur that witchcraft's early rituals, as devised by Gardner, contained much from Crowley's writings such as the [[Liber XV, The Gnostic Mass|Gnostic Mass]]. The third degree initiation ceremony in Gardnerian Wicca (including the [[Great Rite]]) is derived almost completely from the Gnostic Mass.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eocto.org/article/101 |title=Ecclesia Ordinis Caelestis Templum Olympicus - Thelemic Origins of Wicca |publisher=Eocto.org |accessdate=2014-02-25}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Romano-Celtic fusion===
Georg Luck, repeats part of Murray's theory, stating that the Horned God may have appeared in late antiquity, stemming from the merging of [[Cernunnos]], an antlered god of the Continental Celts, with the Greco-Roman [[Pan (god)|Pan]]/[[Faunus]],&lt;ref name="LuckArcana"&gt;{{Cite book|authorlink=Georg Luck |last=Luck |first=Georg |year=1985 |title=Arcana Mundi: Magic and the Occult in the Greek and Roman Worlds: A Collection of Ancient Texts. |location=Baltimore, MD |publisher=Johns Hopkins University Press |pages=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; a combination of gods which he posits created a new deity, around which the remaining pagans, those refusing to convert to Christianity, rallied and that this deity provided the prototype for later Christian conceptions of [[Devil|the devil]], and his worshippers were cast by the Church as witches.&lt;ref name="LuckArcana"/&gt;

==Art, fantasy and science fiction==
[[Image:Francisco de Goya y Lucientes - Witches' Sabbath - WGA10007.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Francisco de Goya]]'s ''[[Witches' Sabbath (1789)|Witches Sabbat]]'' (1789), which depicts [[the Devil]] flanked by Satanic witches. The Witch Cult hypothesis states that such stories are based upon a real-life pagan cult that revered a horned god]]

In 1908's ''[[The Wind in the Willows]]'' by [[Kenneth Grahame]], in Chapter 7, "The Piper at the Gates of Dawn", Ratty and Mole meet a mystical horned being, powerful, fearsome and kind.&lt;ref name="Clifton"/&gt;{{rp|85}} Grahame's work was a significant part of the cultural milieu which stripped the Greek god Pan of his cultural identity in favor of an unnamed, generic horned deity which led to Murray's thesis of historical origins.

Outside of works that predate the publication of Murray's thesis, horned god motifs and characters appear in fantasy literature that draws upon her work and that of her followers.

In the novel ''[[Childhood's End]]'' (1953) by [[Arthur C. Clarke]], all humans have a collective premonition, also described as a memory of the future, of horned aliens which arrive to usher in a new phase of human evolution. The collective subconscious image of the horned aliens is what accounts for mankind's image of the devil or Satan. This theme is also explored in the ''[[Doctor Who]]'' story ''[[The Dæmons]]'' in 1971,  where the local superstitions around a landmark known as The Devil's Hump prove to be based on reality, as aliens from the planet Dæmos have been affecting man's progress over the millennia and the Hump actually contains a spacecraft.  The only Dæmon to appear is a classic interpretation of a horned satyr-like being with hooves.

In the critically acclaimed and influential 1950s TV series created by [[Nigel Kneale]], ''[[Quatermass and the Pit]]'', depictions of supernatural horned entities, with specific reference to prehistoric cave-art and shamanistic horned head-dress are revealed to be a "race-memory" of psychic [[Martian]] grasshoppers, manifested at the climax of the film by a fiery horned god.&lt;ref&gt;White, Eric (1996) ''Once they were men: Now they're Landcrabs: Monsterous Becomings in Evolutionist Cinema'', in

[[Marion Zimmer Bradley]], who acknowledges the influence of Murray, uses the figure of the "horned god" in her feminist fantasy transformation of [[King Arthur|Arthurian myth]], ''[[Mists of Avalon]]'' (1984), and portrays ritualistic incest between King Arthur as the representative of the horned god and his sister [[Morgan le Fay|Morgaine]] as the "spring maiden".&lt;ref&gt;

In the popular video game ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Morrowind|Morrowind]]'', its expansion ''[[The Elder Scrolls III: Bloodmoon|Bloodmoon]]'' has a plot enemy known as Hircine, the Daedric god of the Hunt, who appears as a horned man with the face of a deer skull. He condemned his "hounds" ([[werewolves]]) to walk the mortal ground during the Bloodmoon until a champion defeats him or Bloodmoon falls. When in combat, Hircine appears as a horned wolf or bear.

The 1992 ''[[Discworld]]'' novel ''[[Lords and Ladies (novel)|Lords and Ladies]]'', by [[Terry Pratchett]], features a King of the Elves who is strongly reminiscent of the Horned God.  Although not worshipped by [[Witches (Discworld)|the witches]] who are the heroines of the book (indeed, quite the reverse), they temporarily ally themselves with him out of necessity.

The '''Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995'''&lt;ref&gt;Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, {{USPL|104|45}}, November 8, 1995, 109 Stat. 398.&lt;/ref&gt; is a public law of the [[United States]] passed by the post-[[Republican Revolution]] [[104th United States Congress|104th Congress]] on October 23, 1995. The proposed law was adopted by the [[United States Senate|Senate]] (93–5),&lt;ref&gt;On the passage of {{USBill |104|S.|1322}}, the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, {{USSRollCall |104|1|496}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[United States House of Representatives|House]] (374–37).&lt;ref&gt;On the passage of {{USBill |104|S.|1322}}, the Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995, {{USHRollCall|1995|734}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act became law without a presidential signature on November 8, 1995.

The Act recognized Jerusalem as the capital of the State of Israel and called for Jerusalem to remain an undivided city. Its purpose was to set aside funds for the relocation of the [[Embassy of the United States, Jerusalem|Embassy of the United States in Israel]] from [[Tel Aviv Branch Office of the Embassy of the United States|its location]] in [[Tel Aviv]] to [[Jerusalem]], by May 31, 1999. For this purpose it withheld 50% of the funds appropriated to the State Department specifically for "Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings Abroad" as allocated in fiscal year 1999 until the United States Embassy in Jerusalem had officially opened.&lt;ref name= "BergGamb"&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Marshall J. |last1=Breger |title=Jerusalem Gambit: How We Should Treat Jerusalem Is a Matter of U.S. Constitutional Law as Well as Middle Eastern Politics |journal=National Review |date=October 23, 1995 |volume=47 |issue=20 |pages=41–4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Israel's declared capital is Jerusalem, but this is not internationally recognized, pending final status talks in the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].

Despite passage, the law allowed the President to invoke a six-month waiver of the application of the law, and reissue the waiver every six months on "national security" grounds. The waiver was repeatedly  renewed by Presidents [[Bill Clinton|Clinton]], [[George W.

==Background==
{{Jerusalem large}}
{{main|Positions on Jerusalem#United States|l1=United States positions on Jerusalem}}
Jerusalem holds unique spiritual and religious interests, such as [[Holy Places]] and religious buildings or sites, among the world's [[Abrahamic religions]] of [[Judaism]], [[Christianity]], and [[Islam]]. Following World War I, the victorious Principal Allied Powers recognized these as "a sacred trust of civilization", and stipulated that the existing rights and claims connected with them should be safeguarded in perpetuity, under international guarantee.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | at = Article 28 | title = League of Nations Mandate for Palestine | url = http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/palmanda.asp#art28}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher = ICJ | title = Reports | year = 2004 | contribution = Construction of a wall (advisory opinion) | pages = 165 para. 70, 188 para. 129.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | first = Paul JIM | last = de Waart | quote = The Court ascertained the legal significance of the 'sacred trust of civilization' of the League of Nations (LoN) in respect of the 1922 Palestine Mandate as the origin of the present responsibility of the United Nations | title = International Court of Justice Firmly Walled in the Law of Power in the Israeli–Palestinian Peace Process | journal = Leiden Journal of International Law | volume = 18 |issue=3 | year = 2005 | pages = 467–87 |doi=10.1017/S0922156505002839}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The terms of the British [[Balfour Declaration of 1917]] were included in the [[British Mandate for Palestine (legal instrument)|Mandate for Palestine]] by the [[League of Nations]]. The US government was not a party to these agreements; but stated official foreign policy in 1919 was to 'acquiesce' in the Balfour Declaration, but not officially support [[Streams of Zionism|Zionism]].&lt;ref&gt;Walworth (1986) 473-83, esp. p. 481; Melvin I.

These competing nationalist claims led to increasing civil violence during the inter-war period; following World War II, the "Question of Palestine" was placed before the [[United Nations]], as the League's successor agency.

On November 29, 1947, the UN General Assembly adopted Resolution 181, the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine]]; it contained a recommendation that Jerusalem be placed under a [[Corpus separatum (Jerusalem)|special international regime, a corpus separatum, administered by the United Nations and be separate from both the Jewish and Arab states envisioned]]. Following the [[1948 Arab–Israeli war|conflict that ensued]], cease-fires and the [[1949 Armistice Agreements]] were negotiated and accepted by both sides. One of these resulted, in part, in a temporary division of Jerusalem. The relevant Armistice Agreement with Jordan was signed on April 3, 1949,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://avalon.law.yale.edu/20th_century/arm03.asp|title=The Avalon Project : Jordanian-Israeli General Armistice Agreement, April 3, 1949|website=avalon.law.yale.edu|accessdate=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; but it was considered internationally as having no legal effect on the continued validity of the provisions of the partition resolution for the internationalization of Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="Corpus Separatum"&gt;See "Corpus Separatum §33 Jerusalem" Marjorie M.

He had secured the support of Great Britain (albeit qualified—Great Britain did not recognize the incorporation of East Jerusalem, maintaining that it ought to be part of a corpus separatum, an international enclave).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jcpa.org/jcpa/art/knesset6.htm THE CONSTITUENT ASSEMBLY: FIRST KNESSET 1949-1951.

On December 5, 1949 the Israeli Cabinet, meeting in [[Tel Aviv]], declared Jerusalem the capital of Israel, and on January 23, 1950, the [[First Knesset]] proclaimed that "Jerusalem was, and had always been, the capital of Israel."&lt;ref&gt;Martin Gilbert, ''Jerusalem in the Twentieth Century'' (New York, 1996), pp. 243-244.&lt;/ref&gt; Moreover, on April 24, 1950, the Jordan House of Deputies and House of Notables, in a joint session, adopted a resolution annexing the West Bank and Jerusalem. Because the status of Jerusalem had been included previously in the UN Partition Plan, most countries did not accept this Israeli position, and most embassies have been located elsewhere.&lt;ref name="Corpus Separatum"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.mfa.gov.il/MFA/Foreign+Relations/Israels+Foreign+Relations+since+1947/1947-1974/10+Jordanian+Annexation+of+West+Bank-+Resolution+A.htm|title=Jordanian Annexation of West Bank- Resolution Adopted by the House of Deputies, 24 April, 1950|website=Mfa.gov.il|accessdate=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The United States has stated that its policy on Jerusalem refers specifically to the geographic boundaries of the area that were set out for the "City of Jerusalem", or Corpus Separatum, in Resolution 181, but since 1950, US diplomats have traveled regularly to Jerusalem from the US Embassy in Tel Aviv to conduct business with Israeli officials.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, p. 253.&lt;/ref&gt; The United States has also stated that Jerusalem was part of Mandate Palestine, and in a de jure sense, has not since become part of any other sovereignty.&lt;ref&gt;Foreign Relations of the United States, 1961-1963: Near East, 1962-1963, V.

Advocacy for the Jerusalem Embassy Act reached a zenith during particularly critical times in negotiations for the [[Oslo Accords]] of the [[Israeli–Palestinian peace process|peace process]], despite opposition from both the Israeli and American administrations.&lt;ref name="LevyGood"&gt;[[Daniel Levy (political analyst)|Daniel Levy]], [http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=11647 Is it Good for the Jews?] {{webarchive|url=https://archive.is/20070810193628/http://www.prospect.org/cs/articles?articleId=11647 |date=August 10, 2007 }}, ''[[The American Prospect]]'', June 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The embassy move was, and continued to be, delayed by successive United States government in order to appear neutral on the issue of Jerusalem. However, on December 6, 2017, President [[Donald Trump]] announced that the US recognizes Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, and instructed the State Department to begin preparations to move the embassy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-us-canada-42259443|title=Jerusalem is Israel's capital - Trump|date=December 6, 2017|accessdate=December 7, 2017|website=Bbc.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are allegations by a group of Palestinians that the site is owned by Palestinian Refugees whose property was confiscated by Israel in 1948.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Khalidi|first=Walid|authorlink1=Walid Khalidi|title=The Ownership of the U.S. Embassy Site in Jerusalem|journal=[[Journal of Palestine Studies]]|date=2000|volume=29|issue=4|pages=80–101|doi=10.2307/2676563|JSTOR=2676563|publisher=[[University of California Press]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
The Act asserted that every country has a right to designate the [[Capital (political)|capital]] of its choice, and that Israel has designated Jerusalem. The act notes that "the city of Jerusalem is the seat of Israel's President, Parliament, and Supreme Court, and the site of numerous government ministries and social and cultural institutions." Jerusalem is defined as the spiritual center of [[Judaism]]. Furthermore, it stipulates that since the [[reunification of Jerusalem]] in 1967, religious freedom has been guaranteed to all.

S.3(a)(2) and (3) also stated that ''"[[Jerusalem]] should be recognized as the capital of the State of [[Israel]]; and the United States Embassy in Israel should be established in Jerusalem no later than May 31, 1999"''.

Although the Senate and House votes preceded visits by then Israeli Prime Minister [[Yitzhak Rabin]] and Jerusalem Mayor [[Ehud Olmert]] to [[Washington, D.C.|Washington]] to celebrate the 3000th anniversary of [[King David]]'s declaration of Jerusalem as the capital of the Jews,&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = http://www.jewishsf.com/content/2-0-/module/displaystory/story_id/2261/edition_id/37/format/html/displaystory.html | title = Jewish SF}}.&lt;/ref&gt; little to no progress was achieved in the physical relocation of the U.S. Embassy to Jerusalem until December 2017.

===Timetable===
Section 3 of the Act outlined the U.S. policy and set the initial parameters for the Secretary of State to report in order to receive the full funding — again, with a May 1999 target deadline for the appropriations. The section also briefly stated U.S. policy concerning the matter.

{{quote|
{{sm|Sec. 3. Timetable}}.
: (a) {{sm|Statement of the Policy of the United States}}.—
::: (1) Jerusalem should remain an undivided city in which the rights of every ethnic and religious group are protected.
::: (2) Jerusalem should be recognized as the capital of the State of Israel; and
::: (3) the United States Embassy in Israel should be established in Jerusalem no later than May 31, 1999.
: (b) {{sm|Opening Determination}}.—
:: Not more than 50 percent of the funds appropriated to the Department of State for fiscal year 1999 for "Acquisition and Maintenance of Buildings Abroad" may be obligated until the Secretary of State determines and reports to Congress that the United States Embassy In Jerusalem has officially opened.}}

The major roadblock has been the question of what effect, if any, the relocation may symbolize for other interested parties or neighboring nations involved in the ongoing and sometimes quite contentious Mid-East diplomacy and foreign relations. For this reason, since the legislation's introduction, the consensus has been that this action poses considerable risk to United States national security at home and abroad.

===Constitutional separation of powers===
Under the Constitution of the United States the President has exclusive authority to recognize foreign sovereignty over territory.&lt;ref&gt;See Restatement (3rd) Foreign Relations Law of the United States, American Law Institute, 1986, §§ 203 Recognition or Acceptance of Governments and §§ 204 Recognition and Maintaining Diplomatic Relations Law of the United States.&lt;/ref&gt; The Justice Department's Office of Legal Counsel concluded that the provisions of the Embassy Relocation Act "invade exclusive presidential authorities in the field of foreign affairs and are unconstitutional."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.justice.gov/olc/s770.16.htm |title=Bill to Relocate United States Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem: Memorandum Opinion for the Counsel to the President |publisher=United States Department of Justice |date=May 16, 1995 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100209074518/http://www.justice.gov/olc/s770.16.htm |archivedate=February 9, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Former U.S. presidents [[Bill Clinton]], [[George W. Bush]] and [[Barack Obama]] have alluded to or explicitly stated the belief that Congressional resolutions attempting to legislate foreign policy infringe upon the Executive's authority and responsibility to carry out sound and effective U.S. foreign relations.

Regarding the status of Jerusalem specifically, President Bush had deemed Congress' role as merely "advisory", stating that it "impermissibly interferes with the President's constitutional authority".&lt;ref&gt;[https://georgewbush-whitehouse.archives.gov/news/releases/2002/09/print/20020930-8.html Signing Statement by the President on H.R. 1646], the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, FY 2003, September 30, 2002, [[NARA]] Archives.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[U.S. Constitution]] reserves the conduct of foreign policy to the President; resolutions of Congress, such as the ones found in the Authorization Act of 2003 that included the Jerusalem Embassy Act's provisions, makes the arguments in favor of legislating foreign policy from Congress extremely problematic if not arguably invalid for that Constitutional reason.

Even from the Embassy Act's legislative beginnings, the question of Congress' over-reach, and whether it somehow usurped the Executive's authority or power over matters of foreign affairs, had played a subtle role in shaping the debate at the time. President Clinton took the unusual step of not signing the Embassy Act into law once Congress presented it to him, but instead, to show his disapproval, let 10 days of inaction pass, allowing the bill to return to Congress and automatically become law by Constitutional "default". Clinton's non-action reinforced this sticking point between the branches of the Federal government, without the potential public fallout from taking a "negative stand" on what appeared to be favorable, veto-proof legislation on the surface at the time.&lt;ref&gt;[http://clinton6.nara.gov/1995/10/1995-10-24-press-briefing-by-mike-mccurry.html Press Secretary Briefing, October 24, 1995], White House, National Archives and Records Administration.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.archives.gov/exhibits/charters/constitution_transcript.html#1.7 Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution of the United States].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Congressional Record, [http://thomas.loc.gov/cgi-bin/bdquery/z?d104:SN01322:@@@R Notes &amp; Major Actions on the Embassy Act], S. 1322, [[104th Congress]], [[Office of the Federal Register|OFR]] [[Archivist of the United States]].&lt;/ref&gt;

===Presidential waiver===
This constitutional question was apparent while the legislation was working its way through both chambers; Sen. Dole's amendment adopted into the introduced language included a provision that, in part, returned to the Executive Branch the power over foreign affairs that it already had.

&lt;blockquote&gt;
{{sm|Sec. 7. Presidential Waiver}}.
: (a) {{sm|Waiver Authority}}.—
::: (1) Beginning on October 1, 1998, the President may suspend the limitations set forth in section 3(b) for a period of six months if he determines and reports to Congress in advance that such suspension is necessary to protect the national security interests of the United States.
::: (2) The President may suspend such limitations for an additional six-month period at the end of any period during which the suspension is in effect under this subsections if the President determines and reports to Congress in advance of the additional suspension that the additional suspension is necessary to protect the national security interests of the United States.
::: (3) A report under paragraph (1) or (2) shall include—
::::: (A) a statement of the interests affected by the limitation that the President seeks to suspend; and
::::: (B) a discussion of the manner in which the limitation affects the interests.
: (b) {{sm|Applicability of Waiver to Availability of Funds}}.—
:: If the President exercises the authority set forth in subsection (a) in a fiscal year for the purpose set forth in such section 3(b) except to the extent that the limitation is suspended in such following fiscal year by reason of the exercise of the authority in subsection (a).
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Every six months since 1998, all presidents have invoked the waiver provision under section 7 of the Act, based on national security grounds, to defer the relocation of the embassy from Tel Aviv. The last waiver was signed by President Trump on June 4, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://s3.amazonaws.com/public-inspection.federalregister.gov/2018-14487.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Since this provision went into effect in late 1998, all the presidents serving in office during this period have determined moving forward with the relocation would be detrimental to U.S. national security concerns and opted to issue waivers suspending any action on this front. However, a re-assessment has to take place every six months. In response, members of Congress have begun to include language to do away with the President's exclusivity in making the determinations or flat-out remove the waiver provision completely from the Embassy Act altogether.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=s111-2737&amp;version=is&amp;nid=t0%3Ais%3A31 |title=Jerusalem Embassy Relocation Act of 2009 |accessdate=December 7, 2009 |author=111th Congress (2009) |date=November 5, 2009 |work=S. 2737 |publisher=GovTrack.us |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h111-3412&amp;version=ih&amp;nid=t0%3Aih%3A23 |title=Jerusalem Embassy and Recognition Act of 2009 |accessdate=December 7, 2009 |author=111th Congress (2009) |date=July 30, 2009 |work=H.R. 3412 |publisher=GovTrack.us |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|[The current] Administration remains committed to beginning the process of moving our embassy to Jerusalem;&lt;ref name = "PresDet"&gt;[[s:Jerusalem Embassy Act of 1995#Legislative History|Compiled List of Presidential Determinations]], Addendum to Public Law 104–45, Office of the Federal Register (FR pp compilation)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

: ... while President Obama's issuances mirror the wording first used by President Clinton.

* Section 214 of the Foreign Relations Authorization Act, FY 2003 states:

{{quote|The Congress maintains its commitment to relocating the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem and urges the President ... to immediately begin the process of relocating the United States Embassy in Israel to Jerusalem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.govtrack.us/congress/billtext.xpd?bill=h107-1646&amp;version=enr&amp;nid=t0:enr:449

:The U.S. Congress, however, has the "[[power of the purse]]", and could prohibit the expenditure of funds on any embassy located outside Jerusalem. The U.S. Congress has not managed to repeat the incorporation or passage of language similar to that in Section 214, needed for any attempt to force a foreign policy change by withholding funding.&lt;ref name = "BergPurse"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thefreelibrary.com/Jerusalem%20gambit:%20how%20we%20should%20treat%20Jerusalem%20is%20a%20matter%20of%20U.S....-a017443652

|quote=But in the end, using the spending power to curtail the President's Article II authority won't work. Congress cannot use the power of the purse to seize a power textually committed to the Executive alone. While Congress can probably appropriate money for the construction of a building in West Jerusalem (and create a financial penalty if no construction takes place) it cannot use the "spending power" to order the Executive either in 1996 or 1999 to make that building an embassy rather than a consulate or cultural center. Nor can it order the President to recognize Israeli sovereignty over Jerusalem.}}

* Claims have arisen that as a result of the Embassy Act, official U.S. documents and web sites refer to Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, although this has been the case in many instances before the Act became law. The [[The World Factbook|CIA World Factbook]] has carried the typical Federal citation concerning Israel's capital and the absence of the usual concentration of foreign embassies being within its boundaries or proximity.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url = https://www.cia.gov/library/publications/the-world-factbook/geos/is.html |chapter= Israel &amp;rarr; Government &amp;rarr; Capital | publisher = Central Ingelligence Agency | place = USA | year = 2011 |title= World FactBook}}.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A potential site for a future US Embassy office building in Jerusalem has been demarcated by Israel and the US, and is maintained in the neighborhood of [[Talpiot]]. Currently, the United States has three diplomatic office facilities in Jerusalem: [[Consulate General of the United States, Jerusalem|a consulate on Agron Road in West Jerusalem]], a consular annex on [[Nablus Road]] in East Jerusalem, and a new office annex in the neighborhood of [[Arnona]], located in an area of "[[no man's land]]" between East and West Jerusalem, which opened in October 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.israeltoday.co.il/NewsItem/tabid/178/nid/21990/Default.aspx|title=New US consulate to open in Jerusalem, but where's the embassy?|website=Israeltoday.co.il|accessdate=December 7, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2011 a new bill, the Jerusalem Embassy and Recognition Act of 2011 ([[United States House of Representatives|H.R.]] [http://www.govtrack.us/congress/bill.xpd?bill=h112-1006 1006]), was introduced. Cosponsored by fourteen [[United States Congress|Members of Congress]], including [[United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on Europe and Eurasia|House Europe Subcommittee]] Chairman [[Dan Burton]] (R), [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|House Foreign Affairs Committee]] Chairwoman [[Ileana Ros-Lehtinen]] (R) and [[United States House Foreign Affairs Subcommittee on the Middle East and South Asia|House Middle East Subcommittee]] Chairman [[Steve Chabot]] (R), the bill would discontinue the Presidential waiver authority included in the 1995 Act, relocate the [[List of diplomatic missions of the United States|U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv]] to Jerusalem, and affirm the city as the undivided capital of Israel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Diament|first=Nathan|title=OU Commends Introduction of 2011 Jerusalem Embassy Act| url= http://www.ou.org/public_affairs/article/84044|accessdate= March 22, 2011| publisher = OU Institute for Public Affairs|date=March 22, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bill died at the end of 2011, having failed to clear the [[United States House Committee on Foreign Affairs|House Foreign Affairs Committee]].

President [[Donald Trump]] signed the embassy waiver on June 1, 2017. The [[White House]] meanwhile stated that it did not represent a weakening of his support for Israel. It added that he stood by his promise of moving the embassy.&lt;ref name=signswaiver/&gt; On June 5, 2017, the U.S. Senate unanimously passed a resolution commemorating the 50th anniversary of reunification of Jerusalem by 90-0. The resolution reaffirmed the Jerusalem Embassy Act and called upon the President and all United States officials to abide by its provisions.&lt;ref name="timesofisrael.com"/&gt;

On December 6, 2017, President Trump officially [[United States recognition of Jerusalem as Israeli capital|recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel]], and ordered the [[United States Department of State|State Department]] to begin planning for the relocation of the U.S. Embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt; However, following the announcement, Trump signed an embassy waiver again,  delaying the move, as mandated by the Act, by at least six months.&lt;ref name=FR61127/&gt;&lt;ref name="toi"&gt;{{cite web|title=After Jerusalem recognition, Trump signs waiver delaying embassy move|date=December 7, 2017|author=Staff|publisher=The Times of Israel|accessdate=December 18, 2017|url=https://www.timesofisrael.com/after-jerusalem-recognition-trump-signs-waiver-delaying-embassy-move/}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United States Secretary of State|Secretary of State]] [[Rex Tillerson]] stated that the relocation process will begin immediately, but that the relocation itself however could take years to complete.&lt;ref name="toi"/&gt;  Legally, however, the U.S. embassy can be moved at any time outside of the scope of the Act.

On February 23, 2018, Trump announced that the US Embassy in Israel would reopen at the [[Arnona]] consular services site of the current US Consulate-General in Jerusalem on May 14, 2018, to coincide with the 70th anniversary of the [[Israeli Declaration of Independence]].&lt;ref name="State Department Feb 2018" /&gt;&lt;ref name="TIME 23 Feb 2018" /&gt; This announcement was welcomed by the [[Prime Minister of Israel|Israeli Prime Minister]] [[Benjamin Netanyahu]] and other Israeli government officials.&lt;ref name="JPost 23 Feb 2018"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Hacohen|first1=Hagay|title=Israeli leaders embrace US decision to open Embassy in Jerusalem in May|url=http://www.jpost.com/Israel-News/Israeli-leaders-embrace-US-decision-to-open-embassy-in-Jerusalem-in-May-14-543474|accessdate=February 26, 2018|publisher=[[The Jerusalem Post]]|date=February 23, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the announcement was also condemned by Palestinian officials including [[Hanan Ashrawi]] and chief negotiator [[Saeb Erekat]] since the Embassy's reopening will coincide with the 70th anniversary of the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|"Nakba"]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Tarnopolsky|first1=Noga|title=Date of U.S. Embassy move to Jerusalem shows how even the calendar is complicated in the Middle East|url=http://www.latimes.com/world/la-fg-israel-independence-day-20180224-story.html|accessdate=February 26, 2018|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=February 24, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, despite the move of the Embassy to Jerusalem, President Trump signed on June 4, 2018 an executive order postponing the move of the Embassy to Jerusalem, although it already moved to that city. He was required to sign the order since the Jerusalem Embassy Act requires the US Ambassador to have a permanent residence in Jerusalem, a condition not yet fulfilled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Diamond |first1=Jeremy |title=Trump again signs embassy waiver despite move to Jerusalem |url=https://edition.cnn.com/2018/06/05/politics/trump-us-embassy-jerusalem/index.html |accessdate=October 21, 2018 |publisher=[[CNN]] |date=June 5, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 18, 2018, [[United States Secretary of State]] [[Mike Pompeo]] announced that the US Embassy and Consulate-General in Jerusalem would be merged into a single diplomatic mission. In addition, Pompeo announced the establishment of special Palestinian Affairs Unit inside the Embassy to conduct [[Palestine–United States relations|relations]] with the Palestinians.&lt;ref name="State Department Oct 2018"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Pompeo |first1=Mike |title=On the Merging of U.S. Embassy Jerusalem and U.S. Consulate General Jerusalem |url=https://jru.usconsulate.gov/on-the-merging-of-u-s-embassy-jerusalem-and-u-s-consulate-general-jerusalem/ |publisher=U.S. Consulate General in Jerusalem |accessdate=21 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public opinion===
A poll, taken in November 2017, by the [[Brookings Institution]] found that, of a national sample of 2,000 adults, 63% of Americans polled opposed the move of the embassy from Tel Aviv to Jerusalem, while 31% supported it.&lt;ref name=BrookingsInst&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.brookings.edu/research/the-middle-east-and-russia-american-attitudes-on-trumps-foreign-policy/|title=The Middle East and Russia: American attitudes on Trump's foreign policy|author=Shibley Telhami|date=December 1, 2017|accessdate=January 22, 2017|agency=[[Brookings Institution]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among Democrats, 81% opposed the move and 15% were in support, while among Republicans, 44% opposed the move and 49% supported it.&lt;ref name=BrookingsInst/&gt;

In the 2017 AJC Survey of American Jewish Opinion, done in September 2017, it was found that 16% of American Jews polled supported an immediate move of the embassy to Jerusalem, 36% wanted to move the embassy at a later date in conjunction with Israeli-Palestinian peace talks, 44% opposed moving the embassy, and 4% said they weren't sure.&lt;ref name=AJCSurvey&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.ajc.org/survey2017|title=AJC Survey of American Jewish Opinion 2017|agency=AJC|date=September 13, 2017|accessdate=January 22, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Julio César Tello''' (April 11, 1880 – June 3, 1947)  was a Peruvian [[Archaeology|archaeologist]].&lt;ref name="EMuseumMankato"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/pqrst/tello_julio.html |title= Julio Cesar Tello |work= EMuseum, [[Minnesota State University, Mankato]] |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20060831071312/http://www.mnsu.edu/emuseum/information/biography/pqrst/tello_julio.html |archivedate= 2006-08-31 |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Tello is considered the "father of Peruvian archeology" and was America's first [[indigenous people of the Americas|indigenous]] archaeologist.  He made the major discoveries of the prehistoric [[Paracas culture]] and founded a national [[museum]] of archeology.&lt;ref name="iowa"&gt;[http://www.uiowapress.org/books/2009-spring/burger.htm Richard L. Burger, Abstract of "The Life and Writings of Julio C. Tello"], University of Iowa Press, accessed 27 September 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Tello was born a "mountain Indian" in an [[Andean]] village in [[Huarochirí Province]], Peru; his family spoke [[Quechua languages|Quechua]], the most widely spoken indigenous language in the nation.&lt;ref name="iowa"/&gt; He was able to gain a first-class education by persuading the Peruvian government to fund it. Tello completed his [[Bachelor's degree]] in [[medicine]] at the [[National University of San Marcos]] in Peru in 1909.&lt;ref name="EMuseumMankato"/&gt;  While still a student, Tello studied the practice of [[trepanation]] among natives of Huarochirí and amassed a very large collection of skulls.  He was also studying early pathologies in the population. His collection became the basis for a collection at his university.&lt;ref name="burger"/&gt;  His abilities were recognized early and senior men acted as mentors.

He was awarded a scholarship by [[Harvard University]], where he learned English and earned his [[Master's degree]] in [[anthropology]] in 1911.  Next he went to [[Europe]], where he studied [[archeology]].  In 1912 he attended the Congress of Americanists in [[England]], a group in which he became prominent in later years. It was the beginning of his active international life.&lt;ref name="burger"/&gt;

Tello traveled widely during his career, and regularly invited other scholars to Peru, developing an international network.&lt;ref name="burger"/&gt;  Although Tello published a number of papers in his lifetime, they appeared in little-known journals and newspapers, so they were not well known then even to Spanish speakers.&lt;ref name="iowa"/&gt; For some time his findings and theories were not widely known outside of Peru because he did not publish in recognized academic journals.
Tello discovered the cutler chain and paracas , that 2 cultures were one of the most old cultures in Peru.If you want to see more of this cutlers go to Peru.In peru you learn something new every day !

==Marriage and family==
In 1912 in England for a Congress of [[International Congress of Americanists|Americanists]], Tello met Olive Mabel Cheesman, an English woman who was a student at London University.  They married that year and had several children together. Their eldest daughter died in December 1938.&lt;ref name="burger"/&gt;

==Career==
In 1919 Tello was working with a team at the ''[[Chavín de Huantar]]'' [[archeological]] site, where he discovered a [[stele]] since named for him, the Tello [[Obelisk]]. Construction of the first temple at this major religious center was dated to 850 [[BCE]]. The work of Tello and others established that the site had been a center of complex culture that lasted for several hundred years, to sometime between 500 and 300 BCE. Until late-20th century discoveries established the dates of the 5000-year-old [[Norte Chico civilization|Norte Chico]] site, the [[Chavín culture]] was believed to be the oldest complex [[civilization]] in Peru.

Tello is best known for his discovery in 1927 of 429 [[mummy]] bundles in the ''Cerro Colorado'' area of [[Peru]] on the [[Paracas Peninsula]]. He first visited the site on July 26, 1925, following a trail that had begun in 1915 when he had purchased ancient textiles in [[Pisco]].&lt;ref name="burger"/&gt; On 25 October 1927, Tello and his team uncovered the first of hundreds of ceremonial mummified bundle burials. He was the first in Peru to practice a scientific method of archeological excavation, to preserve [[stratigraphy]] and elements to establish dating and context.  In 1928 the team began to remove the mummies and textiles for safekeeping.&lt;ref name="burger"/&gt;  His findings and interpretations have been the most significant source of information regarding the [[Paracas culture]], which dates to 750 BCE – 100 CE.

The necropolis contained ritual burials, in which corpses were placed in baskets in a sitting position. Each of the bodies was covered by large textiles, works of woven cotton that had been [[embroidered]] in wool to create elaborate designs. He discovered these remarkable textiles which have been described as "spectacular".&lt;ref name="feltham"&gt;{{cite book|last=Feltham|first=Jane|title=Peruvian Textiles |pages= 46–7|year=1989|publisher=Shire Ethnography|isbn=0-7478-0014-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tello and his team had collected 394 textiles and gained funding from the [[Rockefeller Foundation]] for their preservation. They put more than 180 on display by 1938 at the ''Instituto de Investigaciones Antropologicas'', where he and his team were on staff.&lt;ref name="burger"&gt;{{cite book|last=Burger|first=Richard L.|title=The life and writings of Julio C. Tello: America's first indigenous archaeologist, pp. 1, 28 and 38-39, 72|year=2009|publisher=University of Iowa Press|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=75xVOiyWo4gC&amp;pg=PA56&amp;dq=paracas+tello+skulls&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=gLmhTNTHCNC6jAebtv2HAw&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDQQ6AEwAg#v=onepage&amp;q=textiles&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Unlike some of his colleagues, Tello long believed that the [[Andean]] [[Highland (landform)|highlands]] had been important centers of ancient culture and made study of the area a focus of his work. His theory was proven by his work at sites such as [[Chavin de Huantar]] and [[Ayacucho]], a center of [[Wari culture]], as well as later scholars.  In 1936 he, together with prominent scholars [[Alfred Kroeber]], [[Samuel Lothrop]], [[Wendell Bennett]] and others established the [[Institute for Andean Research]] (IAR), to organize and recognize contributions in the field.&lt;ref name="burger"/&gt;

In 1938 the President, [[Óscar R. Benavides]], approved a reorganization of the national museums.  Impressed with the Paracas textile collection, he authorized the new ''Museo de Antropolgia'' to house it.  On January 3, 1939, Tello was named its first director.&lt;ref name="burger"/&gt; This is now the ''[[Museo Nacional de Arqueología, Antropología e Historia del Perú]]''.

The [[Julio C Tello Museum]] on the Paracas Peninsula is named in his honour.  After the reserve was established in 1975, the museum was built to house artifacts and interpret the archeology and culture of the Paracas, as well as the rich natural life of the marine reserve.

'''János Szalárdi''' (23 July 1601&amp;nbsp;– 27 September 1666) was a [[Hungary|Hungarian]] historian in the [[Principality of Transylvania (1570–1711)|Principality of Transylvania]].

He was appointed one of the conservators of the Transylvanian Archives in [[Alba Iulia|Gyulafehérvár]] (today: ''Alba Iulia, Romania''). He served as Secretary of the Chancellery (1644–1649) during the reign of [[George I Rákóczi]] when the position of [[Chancellor of Transylvania|Chancellor]] was vacant since 1634, the death of [[István Kovacsóczy]]. Later he was appointed Secretary for [[Prince of Transylvania]]. He participated in the [[Transylvanian Diet]] of 1666 which commissioned him to collection of taxes of the [[Partium]], [[Kolozs County|Kolozs]], [[Doboka County|Doboka]] and [[Szolnok-Doboka County|Inner Szolnok Counties]]. Szalárdi died in [[Făgăraș|Fogaras]] (today: ''Făgăraș, Romania'').

In 1865, when [[Benjamin Hall Kennedy]] retired as headmaster of [[Shrewsbury School]], his friends and former pupils created a fund with the intention of founding a chair in Latin to be named after him. Kennedy himself added £500 to the fund on the condition that the chair ''not'' be named after him! The professorship was thus created in 1869. In 1911, after Kennedy's death, the professorship was in fact renamed after him, with the consent of his family.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="93869">[[Agrarian reform]] and [[land reform]] have been a recurring theme of enormous consequence in world history. They are often highly political and have been achieved (or attempted) in many countries.

==Latin America==
[[File:MST International Socialist46623.jpeg|300px|thumb|right|Children singing the "[[Internationale]]" at the 20th Anniversary of Brazil's [[Landless Workers Movement]]]]

===Brazil===
[[Getúlio Vargas]], who rose to presidency in [[Brazil]] following the [[Brazilian Revolution of 1930]], promised a land reform but reneged on his promise.

A first attempt to make a nation-wide reform was set up in the government of [[José Sarney]] (1985–1990) as a result of the strong popular movement that had contributed to the fall of the military government. According to the 1988 [[Constitution of Brazil]], the government is required to "expropriate for the purpose of [[agrarian reform]], rural [[property]] that is not performing its social function" (Article 184). However, the "social function" mentioned there is not well defined, and hence the so-called First Land Reform National Plan never was put into force.

Throughout the 1990s, the [[Landless Workers' Movement]] has led a strong campaign on favor of fulfilling the constitutional requirement to land reform. They also took [[direct action]] by forceful occupation of unused lands. Their campaign has managed to get some advances for the past 10 years, during the [[Fernando Cardoso]] and [[Lula da Silva]] administrations.

It is overseen by the [[National Institute for Colonization and Agrarian Reform]].

===Bolivia===
{{Main|Land reform in Bolivia}}
Land in [[Bolivia]] was unequally distributed – 92% of the cultivable land was held by large estates – until the [[History of Bolivia (1920–64)#The Bolivian national revolution (1952-64)|Bolivian national revolution]] in 1952. Then, the [[Revolutionary Nationalist Movement]] government abolished forced [[Peasant|peasantry]] labor and established a program of [[expropriation]] and distribution of the rural property of the traditional landlords to the [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|indigenous]] peasants.  A unique feature of the reform in Bolivia was the organization of peasants into [[syndicates]]. Peasants were not only granted land but their militias also were given large supplies of arms. The peasants remained a powerful political force in Bolivia during all subsequent governments.  By 1970, 45% of peasant families had received title to land. Land reform projects continued in the 1970s and 1980s. A 1996 agrarian reform law increased protection for smallholdings and indigenous territories, but also protected absentee landholders who pay taxes from expropriation. Reforms were continued at 2006, with the [[Bolivian senate]] passing a bill authorizing the government redistribution of land among the nation's mostly indigenous poor.

===Chile===
{{main|Chilean land reform}}
[[Chilean land reform|Attempts at land reform]] began under the government of [[Jorge Alessandri]] in 1960, were accelerated during the government of [[Eduardo Frei Montalva]] (1964–1970), and reached its climax during the 1970-1973 [[presidency of Salvador Allende]]. Farms of more than {{convert|198|acre}} were expropriated. After the [[Chilean coup of 1973|1973 coup]] the process was halted and – up to a point – reversed by the market forces.

===Colombia===
[[Alfonso López Pumarejo]] (1934–1938) passed Law 200 of 1936&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://colombiasupport.net/2012/01/the-land-law-bill-forward-and-back/|title=The Land Law Bill: forward and back|last=|first=|date=|website=Colombia Support Network|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;, which allowed for the expropriation of private properties, in order to promote "social interest".

Later attempts declined, until the [[National Front (Colombia)|National Front]] presidencies of [[Alberto Lleras Camargo]] (1958–1962) and [[Carlos Lleras Restrepo]] (1966–1970), which respectively created the [[Colombian Institute for Agrarian Reform]] (INCORA) and further developed land entitlement. In 1968 and 1969 alone, the INCORA issued more than 60,000 land titles to farmers and workers.

Despite this, the process was then halted and the situation began to reverse itself, as the subsequent violent actions of [[Drug lord|drug lords]], [[Paramilitary|paramilitaries]], [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrillas]] and opportunistic large landowners severely contributed to a renewed concentration of land and to the displacement of small landowners.&lt;ref&gt;Matsetela (2000)&lt;/ref&gt;

In the early 21st century, tentative government plans to use the land legally expropriated from [[drug lords]] and/or the properties given back by demobilized paramilitary groups have not caused much practical improvement yet.

===Cuba===
{{main|Land reform in Cuba}}
Land reform was among the chief planks of the revolutionary platform of 1959.  Almost all large holdings were seized by the [[National Institute for Agrarian Reform]] (INRA), which dealt with all areas of agricultural policy.  A ceiling of 166 acres (67 hectares) was established, and tenants were given ownership rights, though these rights are constrained by government production quotas and a prohibition of real estate transactions.

===Guatemala===
{{Main|Decree 900}}
Land reform occurred during the "[[Guatemalan Revolution|Ten Years of Spring]]" (1944&amp;ndash;1954) under the governments of [[Juan José Arévalo]] and [[Jacobo Arbenz]], after a popular [[revolution]] forced out dictator [[Jorge Ubico]]. The largest part of the reform was the law officially called [[Decree 900]], which redistributed all uncultivated land from landholdings that were larger than {{convert|673|acre|ha}}. If the estates were between {{convert|672|acre|ha}} and {{convert|224|acre|ha}} in size, uncultivated land was expropriated only if less than two-thirds of it was in use.&lt;ref name="Gleijeses 1991"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Gleijeses|first=Piero|title=The Agrarian Reform of Jacobo Arbenz|journal=Journal of Latin American Studies|volume=21|issue=3|year=1989|pages=453–480}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law benefited 500,000 people, or one-sixth of the Guatemalan Population. Historians have called this reform as one of the most successful land reforms in history. However, the [[United Fruit Company]] felt threatened by the law and lobbied the United States government, which was a factor in the [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|US-backed coup]] that deposed the Jacobo Arbenz in 1954. The majority of the reform was rolled back by the US supported military dictatorship that followed.&lt;ref name="Gleijeses 1991"/&gt;

===Mexico===
{{Main|Land reform in Mexico}}
In 1856, the first land reform was driven by the {{lang|es|[[ley Lerdo]]}} (the Lerdo law), enacted by the liberal government. One of the aims of the reform government was to develop the economy by returning to productive cultivation the underutilized lands of the Church and the municipal communities (Indian commons), which required the distribution of these lands to small owners. This was to be accomplished through the provisions of Ley Lerdo that prohibited ownership of land by the Church and the municipalities. The reform government also financed its war effort by seizing and selling church property and other large estates. After the war, the principles of the Ley Lerdo were perverted by President [[Porfirio Diaz]], which caused land concentration and contributed to causing the [[Mexican Revolution]] in 1910. A certain degree of land reform was introduced, albeit unevenly, as part of the Mexican Revolution.

In 1934, president [[Lázaro Cárdenas]] passed the [[1934 Agrarian Code]] and accelerated the pace of land reform. He helped redistribute {{convert|45000000|acre|km2}} of land, {{convert|4000000|acre|km2}} of which were expropriated from American owned agricultural property. This caused conflict between [[Mexico]] and the [[United States]]. Agrarian reform had come close to extinction in the early 1930s. The first few years of the Cárdenas' reform were marked by high food prices, falling wages, high inflation, and low agricultural yields.  In 1935 land reform began sweeping across the country in the periphery and core of commercial agriculture. The Cárdenas alliance with peasant groups was awarded by the destruction of the hacienda system.  Cárdenas distributed more land than all his revolutionary predecessors put together, a 400% increase.  The land reform justified itself in terms of productivity; average agricultural production during the three-year period from 1939 to 1941 was higher than it had been at any time since the beginning of the revolution.

Starting with the government of [[Miguel Alemán Valdés|Miguel Alemán]] (1946–52), land reform steps made in previous governments were rolled back. Alemán's government allowed capitalist entrepreneurs to rent peasant land. This created phenomenon known as [[neolatifundismo]], where land owners build up large-scale private farms on the basis of controlling land which remains [[ejido|ejidal]] but is not sown by the peasants to whom it is assigned.

In 1970, President [[Luis Echeverría]] began his term by declaring land reform dead. In the face of peasant revolt, he was forced to backtrack, and embarked on the biggest land reform program since Cárdenas.  Echeverría legalized take-overs of huge foreign-owned private farms, which were turned into new collective [[ejido]]s.

In 1988, President [[Carlos Salinas de Gortari]] was elected.  In December 1991, he amended Article 27 of the Constitution, making it legal to sell {{lang|es|[[ejido]]}} land and allow peasants to put up their land as collateral for a loan.

[[Francisco Madero]] and [[Emiliano Zapata]] were strongly identified with land reform, as are the present-day (as of 2006) [[Zapatista Army of National Liberation]].

Today, most Mexican peasants are landowners.  However, their holdings are usually too small, and farmers must supplement their incomes by working for the remaining landlords, and/or [[traveling]] to the United States.

===Nicaragua===
During and after the [[Nicaraguan Revolution]] (1979), the [[Sandinista]] government officially announced their political platform which included  land reform.

The last months of Sandinista rule were criticized for the [[Piñata Plan]], which distributed large tracts of land to prominent Sandinistas. After their [[Sandinista#Opposition (1990 - 2006)|loss in the 1990 elections]], most of the Sandinista leaders held most of the private property and businesses that had been confiscated and nationalized by the FSLN government. This process became known as the {{lang|es|piñata}} and was tolerated by the new Chamorro government.

===Peru===
Land reform in the 1950s largely eliminated a centuries-old system of [[debt bondage|debt peonage]].

Further land reform occurred after the 1968 coup by [[left-wing politics|left-wing]] colonel [[Juan Velasco Alvarado]]. The military dictatorship under General Juan Velasco Alvarado (1968–75) launched a large-scale agrarian reform movement that attempted to redistribute land, hoping to break Peru's traditionally inequitable pattern of land holding and the hold of traditional oligarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Hunefeldt, C.  A Brief History of Peru.  New York, NY.&lt;/ref&gt;  The model used by Velasco to bring about change was the associative enterprise, in which former salaried rural workers and independent peasant families would become members of different kinds of cooperatives.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Hunefeldt, C. A Brief History of Peru. New York, NY&lt;/ref&gt; About 22 million acres were redistributed, more land than in any reform program outside of Cuba.  Unfortunately, productivity suffered as peasants with no management experience took control.  The military government continued to spend huge amounts of money to transform Peru's agriculture to socialized ownership and management.  These state expenditures are to blame for the enormous increase in Peru's external debt at the beginning of the 1970s.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;  State bankruptcy was partly caused by the cheap credit the government extended to promote agrarian development, state subsidies, and administrative expenditures to carry out the agrarian reform during this period.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;   The more radical effects of this reform were reversed by president [[Fernando Belaúnde Terry]] in the [[History of Peru#1980s|1980s]].

A third land reform occurred as part of a [[counterterrorism]] effort against the [[Shining Path]] during the [[Internal conflict in Peru]] roughly 1988&amp;ndash;1995, led by [[Hernando de Soto (economist)|Hernando de Soto]] and the [[Institute for Liberty and Democracy]] during the early years of the government of [[Alberto Fujimori]], before the latter's ''auto-coup''.

===Venezuela===
Before 1998, 60 percent of the land in Venezuela was owned by less than 1 percent of the population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://venezuelanalysis.com/analysis/874 | title=Venezuela Announces War Against "Latifundios"| date=2005-01-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;In 2001, [[Hugo Chávez]]'s government enacted [[Plan Zamora]] to redistribute government and unused private land to ''campesinos'' in need. 

The plan met with heavy opposition which lead to a [[2002 Venezuelan coup d'état attempt|coup attempt in 2002]]. When [[Pedro Carmona]] took over the presidency during that event, he reversed the land reform. However, the reversal was declared null when the coup failed and Chávez returned to power. By the end of 2003, 60,000 families had received temporary title to a total of 55,000 km² of land under this plan.

Despite the land reforms carried out by the government, which, according to some sources, have reduced the so-called ''latifundios'' (which means "big landownership"), most receivers of the land didn't have any knowledge about how to cultivate the land and grow crops. In many cases, peasants didn't even water, since water infrastructures were still missing in most of the regions.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news | url=http://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/06/19/AR2009061903400.html | title=In Venezuela, Land 'Rescue' Hopes Unmet| date=2009-06-20| last1=Forero| first1=Juan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, in some cases, ''campesitos'' didn't gain direct ownership of the land, but only the right to farm it without having to pay the rent and without sanctions from the government, and in some cases the land wasn't given to single peasant family, but managed in [[communes]], according to the rules of socialism. According to some sources, the expropriated land amounts to 4-5 million [[hectares]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://foreignpolicy.com/2015/11/13/this-land-was-your-land-venezuela-land-reform-chavez-maduro/ | title=This Land Was Your Land}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=106620230 | title=In Venezuela, Land Redistribution Program Backfires}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The above problems, together with a poor treatment of private companies from the government's side and the absence of [[free market]], led to a shortage [[crisis in Venezuela]], which is still ongoing, even though the redistribution of land itself (not carried out through the "communes") can be considered a positive achievement and it didn't probably cause the crisis.{{pov inline|date=November 2018}}

===Paraguay=== 

Land in [[Paraguay]] has been known to be unequally distributed prolonging rural [[poverty]] in Paraguay. Unequal distribution of land was seen more prominent under the 35-year dictatorship of President [[Alfredo Stroessner]] in the years of 1954 to 1989. Stroessner was also known to take away many [[Tenant farmer|campesino]]'s land in order to give it to military officials, foreign corporations and civilian supporters. As well as faked an alliance with the [[Colorado Party (Paraguay)|Colorado Party]] in order to distribute public land. Campesinos' cries for help for land reform were ignored and the prosecution against them continued, causing them to suffer from high poverty rates. June S. Beittel said that as a result of the unequal distribution of land it left, “ rural areas the most poverty-stricken.”&lt;ref&gt;https://fas.org/sgp/crs/row/R44936.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In the year of 1954, the Truth and Justice Committee focused on getting justice for the abuses many Campesinos were facing from their own government. 

Paraguayan [[democracy]] came a long way after its 35-year [[dictatorship]], but the unequal distribution of land is still a problem for the nation since their economy is one that is dependent on its agriculture. A [[census]] in 2008 revealed that “80 percent of agriculture land is held by just 1.6 percent of landowners, with the 600 largest properties occupying 40 percent of the total productive land. More than 300,000 family farmers have no land at all.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.oxfamamerica.org/static/media/files/Paraguay_background.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; Paraguayans have formed unions such as National Federation of Campesinos (FNC) who has fought for justice on the unequal land distributions in [[Latin America]] they have helped many campesinos reclaim acres of land since 1989. The ongoing inequality of land distribution has lead to a demand for land regulation. 

Paraguay has become the fourth world's largest distributors of [[soy]]. Due to this distribution, soy companies are the largest landowners, taking over 80 percent of the land. This production has negatively impacted the lives of rural peasants by leaving them without their own land. Thus, on March 2017, the streets of Paraguay’s capital were filled with more than 1000 campesinos demanding for agrarian reform.  

Thousands of rural [[peasants]] demand access to land, fair agricultural prices for what they produce and technical assistance. Due to the increase in soy production, campesinos has been forced out of their lands leading them to demand land regulations. This demand of the stabilization and fairness of agricultural prices is a result of Paraguay’s government failing to sustain secure prices for their produce which are leaving them to live in extreme poverty. In the effect of no secure economy for their produce, campesinos mandate technical help.

A great majority of Paraguayans continue to practice [[subsistence]] agriculture in the depths of the Paraguayan ''campo'' (countryside). Despite their struggle with poverty, inequality and land rights, Paraguayans are proud of their campesino structure and the traditional culture that arises from it, with this culture being the most prominent in Paraguay than anywhere else in Latin America.

In December 2017, “over one-third of the population was [[impoverished]] and 19% were living in ‘extreme poverty’”, so “the further centralization of land and power has only functioned to exacerbate socio-economic issues.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.huffingtonpost.com/mario-machado/not-with-a-bang-but-a-soy_b_3851685.html &lt;/ref&gt; Thus, the campesino movement is still ongoing due to the desire to continue their campesino traditions and to be able to make a living wage doing so.

===Ottoman Empire===
The [[Ottoman Land Code of 1858]] (1274 in the Islamic calendar) was the beginning of a systematic land reform programme started during the [[Tanzimat]] period by Sultan [[Abdülmecid I]] of the Ottoman Empire during the latter half of the 19th century, with the overall aims of increasing state revenue generated from land and for the state to be able to have greater control over individual plots of land. This was followed by the 1873 land emancipation act.

===Egypt===
Initially, [[Egyptian land reform]] essentially abolished the political influence of major land owners. However, land reform only resulted in the redistribution of about 15% of Egypt's land under cultivation, and by the early 1980s, the effects of land reform in Egypt drew to a halt as the population of Egypt moved away from agriculture. The Egyptian land reform laws were greatly curtailed under [[Anwar Sadat]] and eventually abolished.

===Iran===
{{main|White Revolution}}
Significant land reform in Iran took place under the [[shah]] as part of the socio-economic reforms of the White Revolution, begun in 1962, and agreed upon through a public referendum. At this time the Iranian economy was not performing well and there was political unrest. Essentially, the land reforms amounted to a huge redistribution of land to rural peasants who previously had no possibility of owning land as they were poorly paid labourers.
The land reforms continued from 1962 until 1971 with three distinct phases of land distribution: private, government-owned and endowed land.  These reforms resulted in the newly created peasant landowners owning six to seven million hectares, around 52-63% of Iran's agricultural land. According to Country-Data, even though there had been a considerable redistribution of land, the amount received by individual peasants was not enough to meet most families' basic needs, "About 75 percent of the peasant owners [however] had less than 7 hectares, an amount generally insufficient for anything but subsistence agriculture.".&lt;ref name="Iran - Rural Society"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-6428.html |title=Iran - Rural Society |publisher=Country-data.com |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;
By 1979 a quarter of prime land was in disputed ownership and half of the productive land was in the hands of 200,000 absentee landlords&lt;ref name="Iran - Rural Society"/&gt; The large land owners were able to retain the best land with the best access to fresh water and irrigation facilities. In contrast, not only were the new peasant land holdings too small to produce an income but the peasants also lacked both quality irrigation system and sustained government support to enable them to develop their land to make a reasonable living. Set against the economic boom from oil revenue it became apparent that the Land Reforms did not make life better for the rural population: according to Amid, "..only a small group of rural people experienced increasing improvements in their welfare and poverty remained the lot of the majority".&lt;ref&gt;Amid, M. (1990) 'Agriculture, Poverty and Reform in Iran' London, Routledge&lt;/ref&gt;
Moghadam argues{{Citation needed|date=March 2009}} that the structural changes to Iran, including the land reforms, initiated by the White Revolution, contributed to the revolution in 1979 which overthrew the Shah and turned Iran into an Islamic republic.

===Iraq===
Under British Mandate, Iraq's land was moved from communal land owned by the tribe to tribal sheikhs that agreed to work with the British.  Known as compradors, these families controlled much of Iraq's arable land until the end of British rule in 1958.  Throughout the 1920s and 30s, more and more land began to be centered in the hands of just a couple families.  By 1958 eight individual families owned almost 1 million acres.  
However, the British did attempt to instill some reforms to increase the productivity of the land in Iraq.  In 1926 the Pump Law was introduced, essentially legislating that all newly irrigated land would be tax free for 4 years.  This led to some short term gains in land productivity.  If land was cultivated for 15 years, it then became the property of the person who cultivated that land.  From 1914 to 1943 there was an increase from 1 million to 4.25 million acres of land developed.  Unfortunately, irrigation of the land was irresponsible, and many farmers didn't allow for drainage, which led to a buildup of salt and minerals in the land, killing its productivity.&lt;ref&gt;A History of Iraq by Charles Tripp&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 the rise of the Communist Party led to the seizing of much of the land by the Iraqi government.  Landholdings were capped at 600 acres in arable areas and 1200 acres in areas that had rainfall.  The concentrated landholdings by the state were then redistributed among the populace, in amounts of 20 acres in irrigated land, with 40 acres in land with rainfall.

In 1970, the [[Ba'th Party]], led by [[Saddam Hussein]] began instituting a wide series of sweeping land reforms.  The intent of the reforms was to remove control of land owned by the traditional rural elites and redistribute it to peasant families.  Modeled after the 1958 land reforms, much of the state land was rented out, though often to people who originally owned the large swathes of land.  The key to this new reform was the [[Agrarian Reform Law of 1970.]]Between 1970 and 1982, 264,400 farmers received grants of land.  However, these reforms did not contribute to an improvement in the production of agricultural goods, leading the regime to increase its imports of food products.&lt;ref&gt;A History of the Modern Middle East, William &gt; Cleveland and Martin Bunton&lt;/ref&gt;

===Maghreb===
As elsewhere in North Africa, lands formerly held by European farmers have been taken over. The nationalisation of agricultural land in [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]] led to the departure of the majority of Europeans.&lt;ref&gt;Raimondo Cagiano De Azevedo (1994). ''"[https://books.google.com/books?id=N8VHizsqaH0C&amp;pg=PA25&amp;dq&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false Migration and development co-operation.]"''. Council of Europe. p.25. {{ISBN|92-871-2611-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Syria===
Land reforms were first implemented in Syria during 1958. The Agricultural Relations Law laid down a redistribution of rights in landownership, tenancy and management.

The reforms were halted in 1961 due to a culmination of factors, including opposition from large landowners and severe crop failure during a drought between 1958 and 1961, whilst Syria was a member of the doomed United Arab Republic (UAR).

After the [[Ba'ath Party]] gained power in 1963 the reforms were resumed. The reforms were portrayed by the governing Ba'ath as politically motivated to benefit the rural property-less communities. According to [[Zaki al-Arsuzi]], a co-founder of the Ba'ath Party, the reforms would "liberate 75 percent of the Syrian population and prepare them to be citizens qualified to participate in the building of the state".&lt;ref&gt;as quoted in Heydemann 1999 p.193 'Authoritarianism in Syria: Institutions and Social Conflict' 1946-1970 Cornell University Press Ithica&lt;/ref&gt;

It has been argued that the land reform represented work by the 'socialist government', however, by 1984 the private sector controlled 74 percent of Syria's arable land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://countrystudies.us/syria/43.htm |title=Syria - Agriculture |publisher=Countrystudies.us |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  This questions both Ba'ath claims of commitment to the redistribution of land to the majority of peasants as well as the state government being socialist (if it allowed the majority of land to be owned in the private sector how could it truly be socialist?). Hinnebusch argued that the reforms were a way of galvanising support from the large rural population: "they [Ba'ath Party members] used the implementation of agrarian reform to win over and organise peasants and curb traditional power in the countryside".&lt;ref&gt;Hinnebusch, R. 2001 p.55 'Syria Revolution From Above' Routledge New York&lt;/ref&gt;  To this extent the reforms succeeded and resulted with an increase in Ba'ath party membership. They also prevented political threat emerging from rural areas by bringing the rural population into the system as supporters.

===Albania===
{{Main|Land reform in Albania}}
[[Albania]] has gone through three waves of land reform since the end of World War II: in 1946, the land in estates and large farms was expropriated by the communist government and redistributed among small peasants; in the 1950s, the land was reorganized into large-scale collective farms; and after 1991, the land was again redistributed among private smallholders.

===Estonia===
{{Main|Estonian Land Reform Act 1919|Estonian Land Reform Act 1991}}

[[Estonia]] has witnessed two periods of land reform in 1919 and 1991 which occurred very shortly after the [[Estonian Declaration of Independence|declaration of Estonian independence]] and the [[Estonian restoration of Independence|restoration of independence]] respectfully. The act of 1919 was primarily concerned with the transferral of land ownership from [[Baltic German]]s to ethnic [[Estonians]]. The 1991 act was instead aimed at the transfer of land ownership from the state (having been nationalised under [[Occupation of the Baltic states|Soviet occupation]]) to private individuals based on historic land ownership in 1940 as well as the protection of the legal rights of the present users of land.

===Finland===
In the general reparcelling out of land, begun in 1757 when Finland was a part of Sweden, the medieval model of all fields consisting of numerous strips, each belonging to a farm, was replaced by a model of fields and forest areas each belonging to a single farm.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www02.oph.fi/etalukio/historia/autonomia/isojako.html Isojako].

In these reparcelling processes, the land is redistributed in direct proportion to earlier prescription.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.helsinki.fi/kansatiede/histmaatalous/maanjaot/uusjako.htm Uusjako hajotti ryhmäkylät].

After the Second World War, [[Evacuation of Finnish Karelia|Karelians evacuated]] from areas ceded to Russia were given land in remaining Finnish areas, taken from public and private holdings with less than full compensation to the previous owners. Also the war veterans, and their widows benefited from these allotments. As a result of post-WWII land reform, 30,000 new farms were established, 33,000 small farms received more land and 67,000 families received either a plot for a single-family home or a homestead with some arable land.&lt;ref&gt;Virtanen, P.

===Ireland===
{{Main|Irish Land Acts}}
At the 19th century, most of the land in Ireland belonged to [[Absentee landlord|large landowners]], most of them of English origin. Most of the Irish population were tenants, having few rights and forced to pay [[Rack rent|high rents]]. This situation was a contributory factor to the [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]] of 1845-1852 and the main cause of the [[Land War]]'s of 1870s-1890s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.failteromhat.com/book/godkin-landwarinireland.htm|title=The Land War in Ireland - A History for the Times.|publisher=|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The governments of the [[United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland]] responded to the agitations in Ireland with a series of [[Irish Land Acts|land acts]], beginning with the First Irish Land Act 1870 (initiated by prime minister [[William Ewart Gladstone]]), followed by further five land acts overseen by a Land Commission, prior to independence in 1922, by which time over 90% of lands had transferred from landlords to their former tenant farmers on negotiated terms with funding provided by the UK government.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/international/encyclopedias-almanacs-transcripts-and-maps/land-purchase-acts-1903-and-1909 Land Purchase Acts 1903+1909 encyclopedic definitions]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Italy ===
Land reform has been a long-standing and widespread problem before the XX century, especially in [[South Italy]]. Despite the vain attempts of the governments to redistribute the land  in South Italy (the so-called ''Mezzogiorno''), from the pragmatic decree '' De administratione Universitatum '' (1792) of [[Ferdinand I of the Two Sicilies]] to the law ''Leggi eversive delle feudalità'' (which literally means "laws abolishing feudalism") in 1806-1808, enacted by [[Joseph Bonaparte]], the issue remained largely unsolved, mainly because of the strenuous opposition of the great landowners, unwilling to lose their privileges and to allow the emancipation of the peasant class. Even with the [[Unification of Italy]], despite the promises of the abolition of the so-called ''latifondi'' ("large estates"), the problem remained unsolved. South Italy's big landowners, which had been loyal to the [[Bourbons]] until the 1860, actively contributed to the unificiation of Italy in order to not lose its prestige, and expropriating estates from them would have implied, for the [[Kingdom of Italy (1861-1946)]], to have a powerful enemy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.brigantaggio.net/brigantaggio/Storia/Meridionale/Qsecond.htm|author=[[Tommaso Pedio]]|title=Latifondo e usi civici, prammatica 1792, eversione della feudalità, usurpazioni delle terre demaniali, adesione dei galantuomini al nuovo regime|access-date=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; South Italy's peasants, disappointed and irritated, rebelled and provoked a bloody civil war, known as [[Brigandage in Southern Italy after 1861|Post-Unification Brigandage]].

The first effective land reform was carried out in 1950, right after the birth of the [[Italian Republic]]. [[Italian Parliament]] passed the decree ''legge stralcio n. 841 del 21 ottobre 1950'', which provided the legal basis for land expropriation and redistribution. The redistribution occurred over a longer period of time, about 10-20 years.

The decree, financed in part with the funds of [[Marshall Plan]], launched by the [[United States]] in 1947, but also opposed by conservative members of the American administration&lt;ref&gt;Sulla complessa vicenda dell'apporto americano, Emanuele Bernardi, "La riforma agraria in Italia e gli Stati Uniti", Bologna, il Mulino, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; probably was, according to some scholars, the most important reform of the [[aftermath of World War II]]&lt;ref&gt;Corrado Barberis ''Teoria e storia della riforma agraria'' Firenze, Vallecchi, 1957&lt;/ref&gt;. The decree provided that the land had to be distributed to peasants through [[compulsory purchase]], thus turning them into [[Small business|small entrepreneurs]] no longer subjected to large landowners. On one side, the reform had a positive outcome to the population, but, on the other side, it also considerably reduced Italian farms size, reducing the chances for bigger companies to grow. However, this drawback was attenuated and, in some cases, eliminated by implementing forms of cooperation. [[Agricultural cooperatives]] started to spread, and, since then, agriculture turned into an entrepreneurial business which could expand, plan its production and centralize the sale of products.

After the land reform of 1950, large estates (''latifondi'') by law cannot be bigger than 300 [[hectares]] (3 [[km²]])&lt;ref&gt;Fonte: Pag 108 del libro ''Studi sul Mezzogiorno repubblicano: storia politica ed analisi'', Di Luca Bussotti, Rubbettino Editore srl, 2003&lt;/ref&gt;. Before the 1950, large estates were widespread, especially in South Italy. Nowadays large estate aren't present anymore on Italy's territory.

For example, in [[Sicily]] before the 1950, large estates larger than 500 [[hectares]] (5 [[km²]]) were 228.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.arts.ed.ac.uk/italian/gadda/Pages/resources/essays/borghisici.php&lt;/ref&gt;. Moreover, 20.6 percent of the island's land was owned by only 282 big landowners.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.marxismo.net/content/view/1932/92/ | title=L'Indipendenza della Catalogna e i compiti della sinistra spagnola}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

In the region [[Abruzzo]], large estates were also widespread. The most notable case is perhaps the estate of the [[Torlonia family]], which owned large estates near [[Fucino|Piana del Fucino]]; its size was more than 14,000 [[hectares]] (140 [[km²]]), and it was redistributed to 5,000 Italian families of landless farmers.&lt;ref&gt;Fonte: Pag 195 di "La Geografia. Per la scuola Media, Volume n°1; G. Bacchi, A. Londrrillo; [[Editore Bulgarini Firenze|Editore Bulgarini]]; [[Firenze]] [[1983]]"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Crop yield]] significantly increased after 1950, since agriculture had become intensive. Following the development of [[industry]], [[agriculture]] has now become a marginal sector of [[Italian economy]], but, by implementing  modern [[Agriculture|agricultural techniques]], its profitability per [[hectare]] increased.

===Russia and the Soviet Union===

The [[Emancipation reform of 1861]], effected during the reign of [[Alexander II of Russia]], abolished [[serfdom]] throughout Russia. More than 23 million people received their liberty. Serfs were granted the full rights of free citizens, gaining the rights to marry without having to gain consent, to own property and to own a business. The Manifesto prescribed that peasants would be able to buy the land from the landlords.

Until the beginning of the 20th century, the vast majority of Russian peasants held their land in communal ownership within peasant communities called [[Mir (commune)|mir]]s, which acted as village governments and cooperatives. Arable land was divided in sections based on soil quality and distance from the village. Each household had the right to claim one or more strips from each section depending on the number of adults in the household.   This communal system was abolished in 1906 by the capitalist-oriented [[Stolypin reform]]s. The reforms introduced the unconditional right of individual landownership. They encouraged peasants to buy their share of the community lands, leave the communities and settle in privately owned settlements called [[Khutor]]s. By 1910 the share of private settlements among all rural households in the European part of Russia was estimated at 10.5%.

The Stolypin reforms and the majority of their benefits were reversed after the [[October Revolution|communist revolution of 1917]]. The [[Decree on Land]], issued by Lenin at 1917, and the "Fundamental Law of Land Socialization" of 1918, decreed that private ownership of land is totally abolished - land may not be sold, purchased, leased, mortgaged, or otherwise alienated. All land, whether state, crown, monastery, church, factory, entailed, private, public, peasant, etc., shall be confiscated without compensation and become the property of the whole people, and pass into the use of all those who cultivate it. These decrees were superseded by the [[1922 Land Code]].   After the universal agricultural collectivization, land codes of the Soviet republics lost their significance. See [[Agriculture in the Soviet Union]].

After the collapse of the USSR, a new land code was enacted, allowing private land ownership. See [[Agriculture in Russia]].

===Sweden===
{{see also|Great Partition (Sweden)}}
In 1757, the general reparcelling out of land began. In this process, the medieval principle of dividing all the fields in a village into strips, each belonging to a farm, was changed into a principle of each farm consisting of a few relatively large areas of land. The land was redistributed in proportion to earlier possession of land, while uninhabited forests far from villages were socialized (see [[Agriculture in Sweden#History]]).

In the 20th century, Sweden, almost non-violently, arrived at regulating the length minimum of [[tenant farming]] contracts at 25 years.

===United Kingdom===
There have been many land reformers in the [[United Kingdom]], but most actual land reform has taken place in [[Scotland]] rather than [[England and Wales]].{{citation needed|date=April 2017}}
Advocates of land reform in Britain have included the 17th-century [[Diggers]], [[John Stuart Mill]], [[Alfred Russel Wallace]], and [[Jesse Collings]].

==Africa==

===Ethiopia===
{{Main|Land reform in Ethiopia}}
Historically, Ethiopia was divided into the northern highlands, which constituted the core of the old Christian kingdom, and the southern highlands, most of which were brought under imperial rule by conquest.   In the northern regions, the major form of ownership was a type of communal system known as ''rist''. According to this system, all descendants of an individual founder were entitled to a share, and individuals had the right to use a plot of family land. Rist was hereditary, inalienable, and inviolable. No user of any piece of land could sell his or her share outside the family or mortgage or bequeath his or her share as a gift, as the land belonged not to the individual but to the descent group. Most peasants in the northern highlands held at least some rist land. Absentee landlordism was rare, and landless tenants were estimated at only about 20% of holdings.    On the contrary, in the southern provinces, few farmers owned the land on which they worked. After the conquest, officials divided southern land equally among the state, the church, and the indigenous population. Tenancy in the southern provinces ranged between 65% and 80% of the holdings, and tenant payments to landowners averaged as high as 50% of the produce.   In the easternlowland periphery and the Great Rift Valley, most land were used for grazing. The pastoral social structure is based on a kinship system with strong interclan connections; grazing and water rights are regulated by custom.

Beginning in the 1950s, the government tried to modernize the agriculture by granting large tracts of traditional grazing lands to large corporations and converting them into large-scale commercial farms. In the north and south, peasant farmers lacked the means to improve production because of the fragmentation of holdings, a lack of credit, and the absence of modern facilities. Particularly in the south, the insecurity of tenure and high rents killed the peasants' incentive to improve production. Further, those attempts by the Imperial government to improve the peasant's title to their land were often met with suspicion. By the mid-1960s, many sectors of Ethiopian society favored land reform. University students led the land reform movement and campaigned against the government's reluctance to introduce land reform programs and the lack of commitment to integrated rural development.

In 1974, The socialist [[Derg]] government rose to power, and on March 4, 1975, the Derg announced its land reform program. The government nationalized rural land without compensation, abolished tenancy, forbade the hiring of wage labor on private farms, ordered all commercial farms to remain under state control, and granted each peasant family so-called "possessing rights" to a plot of land not to exceed ten hectares. The Ethiopian Church lost all its land. Although the Derg gained little respect during its rule, this reform resulted in a rare show of support for the junta.

Tenant farmers in southern Ethiopia welcomed the land reform, but in the northern highlands many people resisted land reform and perceived it as an attack on their rights to rist land. The lowland peripheries were only slightly affected by the reforms.

The land reform destroyed the feudal order. It changed landowning patterns – particularly in the south – in favor of peasants and small landowners. It also provided the opportunity for peasants to participate in local matters by permitting them to form associations.

===Kenya===
In the 1960s, president [[Jomo Kenyatta]] launched a peaceful land reform program based on "willing buyer-willing seller". It was funded by [[Great Britain]], the former colonial power.

In 2006, president [[Mwai Kibaki]] said it will repossess all land owned by "absentee landlords" in the coastal strip and redistribute it to squatters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Joseph |first=Odhiambo |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/low/africa/5275670.stm |title=Pledge to redistribute Kenya land |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-08-22 |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Namibia===
{{Main|History of Namibia#Land reform}}
Namibia's colonial past had resulted in a situation where about 20% of the population (mostly white settlers) owned about 75 percent of all the land.

In 1990, shortly after Namibia got its independence, its first president [[Sam Nujoma]] initiated a plan for land reform, in which land would be redistributed from whites to blacks. legislation passed in September 1994, with a compulsory, compensated approach.&lt;ref&gt;[http://allafrica.com/stories/200608170017.html Namibia: Land Reform to Cost Billions]&lt;/ref&gt;
The land reform has been slow, mainly because Namibia's constitution only allows land to be bought from farmers willing to sell. Also, the price of land is very high in Namibia, which further complicates the matter.

By 2007, some 12% of the total commercial farmland in the country was taken away from white farmers and given to black citizens.

===South Africa===
{{Main|Land Reform in South Africa}}
The [[Natives' Land Act]] of 1913 "prohibited the establishment of new farming operations, sharecropping or cash rentals by blacks outside of the reserves"&lt;ref name="Deininger, Klaus 1999"&gt;Deininger, Klaus. "Making Negotiated Land Reform Work: Initial Experience from Colombia, Brazil and South Africa." World Development Vol. 27(1999): 651-672&lt;/ref&gt; where they were forced to live.

In 1991, after a long anti-apartheid struggle led by the [[African National Congress]], State President [[F. W. de Klerk]] declared the repeal of several apartheid rules, particularly: the Population Registration Act, the Group Areas and the Natives' Land Act. A catch-all [[Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act, 1991|Abolition of Racially Based Land Measures Act]] was passed.&lt;ref name=concise&gt;{{cite book|title=A concise history of South Africa|first=Robert|last=Ross|publisher=Cambridge University Press|year=1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; These measures ensured no one could claim, or be deprived of, any land rights on the basis of race.

In 1994, shortly after the African National Congress came to power in South Africa, it initiated a land reform process focused on three areas: restitution, land tenure reform and land redistribution.&lt;ref name="Deininger, Klaus 1999"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moseley, W.G. and B.

Geographical Review. 98(3): 322-338.&lt;/ref&gt; Restitution, where the government compensates (monetary) individuals who had been forcefully removed, has been very unsuccessful and the policy has now shifted to redistribution.

Initially, land was bought from its owners (willing seller) by the government (willing buyer) and redistributed, in order to maintain public confidence in the land market.&lt;ref name="Deininger, Klaus 1999"/&gt;
This system has proved to be very difficult to implement, because many owners do not actually see the land they are purchasing and are not involved in the important decisions made at the beginning of the purchase and negotiation.

In 2000 the South African Government decided to review and change the redistribution and tenure process to a more decentralized and area based planning process. The idea is to have local integrated development plans in 47 districts.&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Ruth. "Decentralisation in South Africa's Land Redistribution."

===Zimbabwe===
{{Main|Land reform in Zimbabwe}}
By 1979, when [[Zimbabwe]] gained independence, 46.5% of the country's arable land was owned by around 6,000 commercial farmers,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Chigara|first=Ben|year=2002|title=Land Reform Policy|publisher=Ashgate Publishing|page=52|isbn=978-0-7546-2293-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; and white farmers, who made up less than 1% of the population, owned 70% of the best farming land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/africa/692638.stm |title=Britain's troubles with Mugabe|publisher=BBC News  | date=3 April 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As part of the [[Lancaster House Agreement]] of 1979, president [[Robert Mugabe]] initiated a "willing buyer, willing seller" plan, in which white land-owners were encouraged to sell their lands to the government, with partial funding from Britain.&lt;ref name="WILLING"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN081477542X&amp;id=ElOl_a0Rb9AC&amp;pg=PA301&amp;lpg=PA301&amp;ots=LHJcWuepy9&amp;dq=Mugabe+%22willing+buyer,+willing+seller%22&amp;sig=CO_KQT9eoFfdN470PDQUvtZgglg#PPA302,M1 Page 302] ''Big Men, Little People: The Leaders Who Defined Africa''&lt;/ref&gt; Around 71,000 families (perhaps 500,000 people) settled on 3.5 million hectares of former white-owned land under this programme, which was described by "The Economist" in 1989 as "perhaps the most successful aid programme in Africa".&lt;ref&gt;All Party Parliamentary Group Report Dec 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

The 1992 Land Acquisition Act was enacted to speed up the land reform process by removing the "willing seller, willing buyer" clause, limiting the size of farms and introducing a land tax (although the tax was never implemented.)&lt;ref name=pbs&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/africa/land/gp_zimbabwe.html |title=Online NewsHour – Land Redistribution in Southern Africa: Zimbabwe Program |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2012-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Act empowered the government to buy land compulsorily for redistribution, and a fair compensation was to be paid for land acquired. Landowners could challenge in court the price set by the acquiring authority. Opposition by landowners increased throughout the period of 1992 to 1997. In the 1990s, less than 1 million hectares (2.47 million acres) were acquired, and fewer than 20,000 families were resettled. Much of the land acquired during what has become known as "phase one" of land reform was of poor quality, according to Human Rights Watch. Only 19 percent of the almost 3.5 million hectares (8.65 million acres) of resettled land was considered prime, or farmable.

In 1997, the new British government, led by [[Tony Blair]], unilaterally stopped funding the "willing buyer, willing seller" land reform programme. Britain's ruling Labour Party felt no obligation to continue paying white farmers compensation.

In 2000, [[Zimbabwean constitutional referendum, 2000|a referendum on constitution]]al amendments was held. The proposed amendments called for a "fast track" land reform and allowed the government to confiscate white-owned land for redistribution to black farmers without compensation. The motion failed with 55% of participants against the referendum.&lt;ref name="CONSTREF"&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?vid=ISBN0749440651&amp;id=IEfzrFNicNkC&amp;pg=RA7-PA372&amp;lpg=RA7-PA372&amp;ots=hxNyGgpjJJ&amp;dq=Mugabe+Constitution+2000+February+12&amp;sig=01pjadymQ5N5OHGmuXfPG1ETsFI#PRA7-PA372,M1 Page 372] ''Africa Review 2003/2004''&lt;/ref&gt; However, self-styled "war veterans", led by [[Chenjerai Hunzvi]], began invading white-owned farms.

Parliament, dominated by [[Zanu-PF]], passed a constitutional amendment, signed into law on 12 September 2005, that nationalised farmland acquired through the "Fast Track" process and deprived original landowners of the right to challenge in court the government's decision to expropriate their land.&lt;ref&gt;{{webarchive |url=http://webarchive.loc.gov/all/20051112040534/http://voanews.com/english/archive/2005-09/2005-09-12-voa36.cfm?CFID=53041476&amp;CFTOKEN=35798529 |title=voanews.com |date=2005-11-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Supreme Court of Zimbabwe]] ruled against legal challenges to this amendment.&lt;ref name="zimsupct"&gt;Mike Campbell (Private) Limited v. The Minister of National Security Responsible for Land, Land Reform and Resettlement, Supreme Court of Zimbabwe, 22 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

During the "fast track", many parcels of land came under the control of people close to the government, as is the case throughout Africa.  The several forms of forcible change in management caused a severe drop in production and other economic disruptions.

==North America==

===Canada===
{{Main|Land Purchase Act (1875)}}
A land reform was carried out as part of [[Prince Edward Island]]'s agreement to join the [[Canadian Confederation]] in 1873. Most of the land was owned by [[absentee landlords]] in England, and as part of the deal Canada was to buy all the land and give it to the farmers.

===United States===
{{Main|Forty acres and a mule|Dawes Act}}
Following the [[American Civil War|U.S. Civil War]], many blacks and military officials considered land reform vital. The downfall of the [[Confederate States of America|Confederacy]] emancipated millions, but few former slaves had the means to exercise real autonomy. Land, even at depressed post-war prices, was difficult for African Americans to procure.&lt;ref&gt;Eric Foner, ''Reconstruction: America's Unfinished Revolution, 1863-1877'', Harper &amp; Row, 1988, p. 374&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, with southern wealth the result of centuries of forced labor, blacks nationwide called for property on the basis of just [[reparations for slavery|reparations]].&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 1988, p. 104&lt;/ref&gt; Politically, redistribution carried the support of [[Radical Republican]]s.&lt;ref&gt;Alan Brinkley, ''The Unfinished Nation: A Concise History of the American People'', 6th ed, McGraw-Hill, 2010, p.372-374&lt;/ref&gt; But opposing any grants to blacks were [[southern Democrats]], along with a White House committed to 'restoration'.&lt;ref&gt;Brinkley, 2010, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Clayborne Carson]], Emma J. Lapsansky-Werner, and [[Gary B. Nash]], ''The Struggle for Freedom: A History of African Americans'', Combined vol., 2nd ed., Prentice Hall, 2011, p. 265-266,276-277&lt;/ref&gt; Given national divisions, reform efforts were varied but short-lived.

Many [[African Americans]] believed property was critical to erasing slave-oriented social order.&lt;ref&gt;Brinkley, 2010, p. 371&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to speaking out, some demanded plots and moved into their master’s plantation homes by force.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 1988, p.104-105&lt;/ref&gt; Others bought land collectively, or squatted on what was undeveloped.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 1988, p. 105-106, 403&lt;/ref&gt; Throughout war and [[Reconstruction Era of the United States|Reconstruction]], the presence of [[Federal government of the United States|Federal]] troops provided a platform for agricultural policy. In 1865, [[William Tecumseh Sherman]] issued [[Sherman's Special Field Orders, No. 15|Field Order 15]], taking coastal land in [[South Carolina]], [[Georgia (U.S. state)|Georgia]] and [[Florida]], and dividing it into 40-acre plots for black settlement, hence the term "[[40 acres and a mule]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.history.umd.edu/Freedmen/sfo15.htm|title=Order by the Commander of the Military Division of the Mississippi|accessdate=2012-12-31|publisher=Freedmen and Southern Society Project}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March, Congress established the [[Freedmen’s Bureau]], whose commissioner had authority to redistribute confiscated or abandoned southern land.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://oll.libertyfund.org/?option=com_staticxt&amp;staticfile=show.php%3Ftitle=2282&amp;chapter=216250&amp;layout=html&amp;Itemid=27|title=Freedmen's Bureau Bill|chapter=An Act to Establish a Bureau for the Relief of Freedmen and Refugees|accessdate=November 2, 2018|publisher=[[The Online Library of Liberty]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Bureau held {{convert|850,000|acre|km2}}, and key directors pushed for its settling with former slaves. When President [[Andrew Johnson]] began to pardon Confederates and restore their property, [[Commissioner]] [[Oliver O. Howard]] issued Circular 13. The order instructed agents to establish 40-acre parcels with haste. Johnson rescinded the order, and an overwhelming majority of Bureau land returned to its previous owners.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 1988, p. 159&lt;/ref&gt;

The final reform attempts of Reconstruction occurred within state governments. In South Carolina, a land commission was established, which purchased property and sold it on long-term credit.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 1988, p. 375&lt;/ref&gt; Other state Republicans utilized new tax systems, penalizing large estates, to seize and divide land and stimulate black ownership. This indirect method achieved little, as taxes were repaid and lands were reclaimed. Of property not redeemed, much was exploited by investors.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 1988, pp. 375-377&lt;/ref&gt;

Ultimately, Reconstruction was discounted as 'Socialism' by moderates committed to free-market transformation, a popular new line of political attack&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 1988, pp. 524–525&lt;/ref&gt; levied against the likes of [[William M. Tweed|Boss Tweed]] and [[Benjamin Butler (politician)|Benjamin F. Butler]] alike.&lt;ref&gt;Republicans of the era firmly believed in free-labor ideology, considering the laws of contract vital to society. Reconstruction policy was predominantly geared to establishing a workforce employed conditionally, and paid for its work. Foner, 1988, pp. 164-169, 379-380&lt;/ref&gt; Radicals began to fall even earlier, with the failure of [[Impeachment of Andrew Johnson|Johnson’s impeachment]]. [[Liberal Republican Party (United States)|Liberal Republicans]], eroding the era's political landscape, called for an immediate end to “black barbarism”.&lt;ref&gt;James S. Pike, reporting on the south, indicating the growing appeal of racist rhetoric in anti-Reconstruction politics. Foner, 1988, p. 525&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 1988, pp. 524-531&lt;/ref&gt; White supremacist violence and [[Panic of 1873|financial panic]]&lt;ref&gt;Brinkley, 2010, p. 387&lt;/ref&gt; weakened Reconstruction to the breaking point. With the [[Compromise of 1877]], it was finished.&lt;ref&gt;Foner, 1988, pp. 602-612&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 19th century, [[Native Americans in the United States|Indian]] tribes owned about 138 million acres (560,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) of land in the USA. Land was considered the property of the whole tribe, which used it to cater to the needs of the individual tribe members. This approach to land ownership was different than the white European approach, which regarded land as private property of individuals.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Many US politicians{{Who|date=July 2014}} believed it was important to assimilate Native Americans into white American culture, and thus have their lands open for commerce and development. The [[Dawes Act]] (also known as the General Allotment Act or the Dawes Severalty Act), adopted by Congress in 1887, authorized the President of the United States to survey American Indian tribal land and divide it into allotments for individual Indians. Those who accepted allotments and lived separately from the tribe would be granted United States citizenship. The Dawes Act was amended in 1891, and again in 1906 by the [[Burke Act]].

Through the Dawes Act, many Indians received private title to a land-plot, but most of the Indian lands were considered "surplus", and put to sale to white European settlers. Thus, the total amount of land owned by Indians decreased to only 48 million acres (190,000&amp;nbsp;km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;) in 1934.{{Citation needed|date=July 2014}}

Most tribal land still owned by ethnic Indians was recollectivized in 1934.

===Afghanistan===
Afghanistan has had a couple of attempts at land reform.

In 1975, the government of president [[Mohammad Daoud Khan]] responded to the inequities of the existing land tenure conditions by issuing a Land Reform Law. It limited individual holdings to a maximum of 20 hectares of irrigated, double-cropped land. Larger holdings were allowed for less productive land. The government was to expropriate all surplus land and pay compensation. To prevent the proliferation of small, uneconomic holdings, priority for redistributed lands was to be given to neighboring farmers with two hectares or less. Landless sharecroppers, laborers, tenants, and nomads had next priority. Despite the government's rhetorical commitment to land reform, the program was quickly postponed. Because the government's landholding limits applied to families, not individuals, wealthy families avoided expropriation by dividing their lands nominally between family members. The high ceilings for landholdings restricted the amount of land actually subject to redistribution. Finally, the government lacked the technical data and organizational bodies to pursue the program after it was announced.

After the 1978 [[Saur Revolution]], the communist [[Peoples Democratic Party of Afghanistan]] (PDPA) issued Decree No. 6, which canceled gerau and other mortgage debts of agricultural laborers, tenants, and small landowners with less than two hectares of land. The cancellation applied only to debts contracted before 1973. The Decree No. 8 of November 1978 made new landholdings from the 20 hectares of prime irrigated land in the 1975 law to just six hectares. It divided all land into seven classes and again allowed for larger holdings of less productive land. There was no compensation for government-expropriated surplus land and it established categories of farmers who had priority for redistributed land; sharecroppers already working on the land had highest priority.&lt;ref&gt;Afghanistan Country Study and Government Publication&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.iit.edu/govdocs/afghanistan/Agriculture.html Afghanistan Country Study]&lt;/ref&gt;

===China===
{{also|Mass killings of landlords under Mao Zedong}}
Since the fall of the Qing dynasty in 1911, China has been through a series of land reform programs. The founder of the [[Kuomintang|Nationalist Party]], [[Sun Yat-sen]], advocated a "[[Land reform|land to the tiller]]" program of [[Socialist ideology of the Kuomintang#History|equal distribution of land]]. which was partly implemented by the Nationalist Government under [[Chiang Kai-shek]]. In the 1940s, the [[Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction]], funded with American money, with the support of the national government, carried out land reform and community action programs in several provinces.

In October 1947, two years before the foundation of the People's Republic of China (PRC), the Communist Party of China launched land reform campaigns that established control in North China villages.

In the mid-1950s, a second land reform during the [[Great Leap Forward]] compelled individual farmers to join collectives, which, in turn, were grouped into [[People's communes]] with centrally controlled [[property rights]] and an egalitarian principle of distribution. This policy was generally a failure in terms of production.&lt;ref name="Fao.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/sd/LTdirect/LTan0031.htm |title=SD: Institutions : Land reform in rural China since the mid-1980s, Part 1 |publisher=Fao.org |accessdate=2010-06-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101223213916/http://www.fao.org/sd/LTdirect/LTan0031.htm |archivedate=2010-12-23 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The PRC reversed this policy in 1962 through the proclamation of the Sixty Articles. As a result, the ownership of the basic means of production was divided into three levels with collective land ownership vested in the production team (see also Ho [2001]).

A third land reform beginning in the late 1970s re-introduced the family-based contract system known as the [[Responsibility system|Household Responsibility System]], was followed by a period of [[Economic stagnation|stagnation]]. Chen, Wang, and Davis [1998] suggest that the stagnation was due, in part, to a system of periodic redistributions that encouraged [[over-exploitation]] rather than private [[capital investment]] in future [[productivity]].&lt;ref name="Fao.org"/&gt; However, although [[land use rights]] were returned to individual farmers, collective land ownership was left undefined after the disbandment of the People's Communes.

Since 1983, China has launched a series of land policy reforms to improve land-use efficiency, to rationalize land allocation, to enhance land management, and to coordinate urban and rural development. These land policy reforms have yielded positive impacts on urban land use as well as negative socioeconomic consequences. On the positive side, they have contributed to emerging land markets, increased government revenue for the financing of massive infrastructure projects and provision of public goods, and improved the rationalization of land use. On the negative side, problems such as loss of social equity, socioeconomic conflicts, and government corruption have emerged.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1016/s0264-8377(02)00073-x| title = Land policy reform in China: Assessment and prospects| journal = Land Use Policy| volume = 20| issue = 2| pages = 109–120| year = 2003| last1 = Ding | first1 = C. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since 1998 China is in the midst of drafting the new [[Property Law]] which is the first piece of national legislation that will define the land ownership structure in China for years to come. The Property Law forms the basis for China's future land policy of establishing a system of [[Fee simple|freehold]], rather than of [[private ownership]] (see also Ho, [2005]).

===India===
{{Main|Land reform in India}}
Under the British occupation, the land system in India has been feudalic, with few absentee landlords holding most of the lands and claiming high rents from poor peasants. The demand for a land reform was a major theme in the demand for independence. After independence, the different states in India gradually started a land reform process in four main categories: abolition of intermediaries (rent collectors under the pre-Independence land revenue system); tenancy regulation (to improve the contractual terms including security of tenure); a ceiling on landholdings (to redistribute surplus land to the landless); and attempts to consolidate disparate landholdings. The extent and success of these reforms varied greatly between the different states of India.

===Japan===
The first land reform in recent history, called the [[Land Tax Reform (Japan 1873)|Land Tax Reform]] or {{nihongo||地租改正|chisokaisei}}, passed in 1873, six years after the [[Meiji Restoration]]. It established the right of private land ownership in Japan for the first time and was a major restructuring of the previous land taxation system.

The government initially ordered individual farmers to measure the plots of their land themselves, calculate their taxes, and submit the results to local tax officials. However, difficulties arose with the honesty of the measuring system and the government responded by forcefully changing land values to meet the set amount if self-reported values did not meet projected values. This caused widespread resentment among farmers and several large-scale riots, causing the government to lower the tax rate from 3% to 2.5%. The department continued its aggressive taxation until 1878, but the strictness of rules gradually decreased as it became clear that required amounts would be met. By 1880, seven years after the start of the land reforms, the new system had been completely implemented.

Private land ownership was recognized for the first time in Japan with the issuing of land titles. Previously, individual farmers were merely borrowing the land from feudal lords, who in turn were borrowing the land from the emperor. The reform abolished this archaic system of land ownership, and began to allow landowners to use their property as a financial asset in collateral or other investment. This law was one of the first steps towards the development of capitalism in Japan, paralleling the English (and later United Kingdom) statute [[Quia Emptores]] enacted several centuries earlier.

Another major land reform was carried out in 1947, during the [[Occupied Japan|occupied era]] after World War II, under instructions of the [[Supreme Commander of the Allied Powers]] based on a proposal from the Japanese government which had been prepared before the defeat of the [[Empire of Japan|Greater Japanese Empire]]. This last reform is also called {{nihongo||農地解放|Nōchi-kaihō|emancipation of farming land}}.

Between 1947 and 1949, approximately {{convert|5800000|acre|km2}} of land (approximately 38% of Japan's cultivated land) was purchased from the  [[landlord]]s under the reform program and re-sold at extremely low prices (after inflation) to the farmers who worked them. By 1950, three million peasants had acquired land, dismantling a power structure that the landlords had long dominated.&lt;ref&gt;Flores 1970, p. 901.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Philippines===
{{Main|Land reform in the Philippines}}
During the [[Diosdado Macapagal|Macapagal]] administration in the early 1960s, a limited land reform program was initiated in [[Central Luzon]] covering rice fields.

During the martial law era of the [[Ferdinand Marcos]] Administration, Presidential Decree 27 instituted a land reform program covering rice and corn farms. Rice and corn production under this land reform program was heavily supported by the Marcos Administration with land distribution and financing program known as the Masagana 99 and other production loans that led to increased rice and corn production. The country produced enough rice for local consumption and became a rice exporter during that period.

The [[Corazon Aquino]] Administration in the mid-1980s instituted a very controversial land reform known as CARP, which covered all agricultural lands. The program led to rice shortages in the succeeding years and lasted for 20 years without accomplishing the goal of land distribution. The program caused entrepreneurs to stay away from agriculture and a number of productive farmers left the farming sector. The CARP was a monumental failure in terms of cost to the government and the landowners whose lands were subjective to legal landgrabbing by the government. CARP expired at the end of December 2008.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.inquirer.net/specialfeatures/agrarianreform/view.php?db=1&amp;article=20090103-181229 CARP not renewed], Inquirer.net, 3 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sri Lanka===
In 1972, the Government of [[Sirimavo Bandaranaike]], through the Land Reform Law, imposed a ceiling of twenty hectares on privately owned land and sought to distribute lands in excess of the ceiling for the benefit of landless peasants. Both land owned by public companies and paddy lands under ten hectares in extent were exempted from this ceiling. Between 1972 and 1974, the Land Reform Commission took over nearly 228,000 hectares. In 1975 the Land Reform (Amendment) Law brought over 169,000 hectares of plantations owned by companies (including British-owned companies) under state control.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.country-data.com/cgi-bin/query/r-13209.html |title=Sri Lanka land reform legislation |publisher=Country-data.com |accessdate=2010-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===South Korea===
From 1945 to 1950, United States and South Korean authorities carried out a land reform that retained the institution of private property. They confiscated and redistributed all land held by the Japanese colonial government, Japanese companies, and individual Japanese colonists. The Korean government carried out a reform whereby Koreans with large landholdings were obliged to divest most of their land. A new class of independent, family proprietors was created.

===Taiwan===
{{Main|Land reform in Taiwan}}
In the 1950s, after the Nationalist government came to Taiwan, land reform and community development was carried out by the [[Sino-American Joint Commission on Rural Reconstruction]]. This course of action was made attractive, in part, by the fact that many of the large landowners were Japanese who had fled, and the other large landowners were compensated with Japanese commercial and industrial properties seized after Taiwan reverted from Japanese rule in 1945. The land program succeeded also because the [[Kuomintang]] were mostly from the mainland and had few ties to the remaining indigenous landowners. See also: [[Taiwan Land Reform Museum]]

===Vietnam===
{{Main|Land reform in Vietnam}}{{Main|Land reform in South Vietnam}}{{Main|Land reform in North Vietnam}}

In the years after [[World War II]], land redistribution to poor and landless peasants was initiated by the communist [[Viet Minh]] insurgents in areas which they controlled.  After the partition of the country into two parts ([[North Vietnam]] and [[South Vietnam]]), the communist land reform (1953–1956) redistributed land to more than 2 million poor peasants, but at a cost of thousands, possibly tens of thousands of lives &lt;ref&gt;''The Viet Minh Regime, Government and Administration in the Democratic Republic of Vietnam'', Bernard Fall, Greenwood Press, Connecticut, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt; and contributed to the exodus of up to 1 million people from the North to the South in 1954 and 1955.{{citation needed|date=July 2015}}. The land reform campaign was accompanied by large-scale repression and excesses.&lt;ref name="Nhan_VietEconPol"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Nhan|first1=Vo Tri|title=Vietnam's Economic Policy Since 1975|date=1990|publisher=Institute for Southeast Asian Studies|isbn=978-981-3035-54-6|pages=2–7|edition=1|url=https://books.google.com/?id=Y7htC9I_J34C&amp;pg=PA232&amp;dq=vo+nhan+tri#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=8 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; some of which were subsequently criticized within the ruling Workers Party of Vietnam itself.&lt;ref name="Nhan_VietEconPol"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Moise_LandRef"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moise|first1=Edwin E.|title=Land Reform and Land Reform Errors in North Vietnam|journal=Pacific Affairs|volume=49|issue=1, Sping 1976|pages=84–85|doi=10.2307/2756362|jstor=2756362|year=1976}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Communist Party of Vietnam, ''Kinh nghiệm giải quyết vấn đề ruộng đất trong cách mạng Việt Nam'' (Experience in land reform in the Vietnamese Revolution), available online: [https://web.archive.org/web/20080120020044/http://dangcongsan.vn/details.asp?topic=2&amp;subtopic=5&amp;leader_topic=79&amp;id=BT1060374012 Bao Dien tu Dang Cong san Viet Nam]&lt;/ref&gt;

South Vietnam made several further attempts in the post-[[Ngo Dinh Diem|Diem]] years, the most ambitious being the [[Land to the Tiller (South Vietnam)|Land to the Tiller]] program instituted in 1970 by President [[Nguyen Van Thieu]]. This limited individuals to 15 hectares, compensated the owners of expropriated tracts, and extended legal title to peasants who in areas under control of the South Vietnamese government to whom had land had previously been distributed by the [[Viet Cong]].

The '''list of Japanese era names''' is the result of a [[periodization]] system which was established by [[Emperor Kōtoku]] in 645. The system of {{nihongo|[[Japanese era name]]s|年号|''nengō''|"year name"}} was irregular until the beginning of the 8th century.&lt;ref name="tsuchihashi16"&gt;Tsuchihashi, Paul. (1952). [https://books.google.com/books?ei=7QY6TbbKOYT58AaIpuTaCg&amp;ct=result&amp;id=0HfrAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=Tsuchihashi+paul&amp;q=saimei#search_anchor  ''Japanese Chronological Tables from 601 to 1872'', p. 16].&lt;/ref&gt; After 701, sequential era names developed without interruption across a span of centuries.&lt;ref&gt;Brown, Delmer M. ''et al.'' (1979). {{Google books|w4f5FrmIJKIC|''Gukanshō'', p. 32.|page=32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Conversion table ==
To convert a Japanese year to a Western or [[Gregorian calendar]] year, find the first year of the [[nengō]] (''the nengō = the era name, see list below''). When found, subtract 1, and add the number of the Japanese year. For example, the 23rd year of the [[Shōwa period]] (Shōwa 23) corresponds to 1926 + 23 &amp;minus; 1 = [[Common Era]] 1948.

[[File:Longkan Shoujian - Chinese Dictionary Museum.JPG|thumb|300px|''Longkan Shoujian'' in the Chinese Dictionary Museum, [[Jincheng]], [[Shanxi]]]]
'''''Longkan Shoujian''''' ({{zh|t=龍龕手鑒}} "The Handy Mirror in the Dragon Shrine") is a [[Chinese dictionary]] compiled during the [[Liao Dynasty]] by the [[Khitan people|Khitan]] monk Xingjun (行均). Completed in 997, the work had originally been entitled ''Longkan Shoujing'' (龍龕手鏡 [鑒 and 鏡 are synonyms]), but had its title changed owing to [[naming taboo]] when it was later printed by the [[Song Dynasty|Song]] publishers. ([[Emperor Taizu of Song|Emperor Taizu]]'s grandfather had the name 敬, a homophone of 鏡.) The earliest surviving edition of the work is an incomplete [[Korea]]n one, reprinted in China in 1985.

''Longkan Shoujian'' was one of the many [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] ''yinyishu'' (音義書 "dictionary of pronunciations and meanings") produced in ancient China, which were meant to aid the study of Buddhist scriptures. However, the work stands out in two aspects. Firstly, its method of [[collation]] is innovative. While Chinese dictionaries before ''Shoujian'' collate [[Chinese character|character]]s either graphically (by [[radical (Chinese character)|radical]]) or phonetically (by [[tone name|tone]] and [[syllable rime|rime]]), the work employs both methods: the radicals, which number 242 (including the "radical" ''zai'' (雜 "miscellaneous"), where are found characters difficult to be analyzed graphically), are grouped by tone into four groups (each group occupies one ''juan'' (卷) or fascicle); the characters under each radical are in turn grouped by tone. Secondly, it collects more than 26,000 characters with a huge proportion of variant characters. Many of these variants are not recorded in any other works.

The characters in it are divided, in terms of orthography, into "standard" (正 ''zheng''), "vulgar" (俗 ''su''), "contemporary" (今 ''jin''), "archaic" (古 ''gu'') and "alternative" (或作 ''huozuo''), a classification more elaborated than that used in ''[[Ganlu Zishu]]''. The pronunciations of characters in it are indicated by either homophone or ''[[fanqie]]'' spelling. For some characters, only the pronunciations are given, not the meanings.

While being criticized for its unorthodox collation and collection by the [[Qing Dynasty|Qing]] philologists, it is hailed by Pan (1980) as an essential guide for deciphering the [[Dunhuang manuscripts]], which contains a large amount of "vulgar" characters.

'''Nada Klaić''' (21 July 1920, [[Zagreb]] – 2 August 1988, Zagreb{{sfn|Talan|Treskanica|2009|p=371}}) was a [[Croatia]]n [[historian]]. She was a Croatian [[Medievalism|medievalist]] of the 20th century.{{sfn|Majnarić|2009}} A substantial part of the work was devoted to criticism of medieval sources.{{sfn|Majnarić|2009}}

==Academic career==
Nada Klaić was born in [[Zagreb]], the granddaughter of the historian [[Vjekoslav Klaić]] and sister of landscape architect [[Smiljan Klaić]].{{sfn|Talan|Treskanica|2009|p=371}} She was a university professor and a prominent Croatian medievalist, graduated at the [[Faculty of Philosophy, Zagreb|Faculty of Philosophy]] of the [[University of Zagreb]], the same faculty where she was involved in teaching for 45 years.{{sfn|Talan|Treskanica|2009|p=371}} She started her teaching and scientific career at the Faculty's Department of History in 1943,{{sfn|Majnarić|2009}} to become a full professor of the Croatian medieval history in 1969.{{sfn|Majnarić|2009}}{{sfn|Talan|Treskanica|2009|p=371}} This position she held until her death in 1988.{{sfn|Majnarić|2009}}

Since 1946, when she took her doctor's degree with the thesis ''Političko i društveno uređenje Slavonije za Arpadovića'' (Political and Social Organization of [[Slavonia]] under the [[Árpád dynasty]]),{{sfn|Majnarić|2009}}{{sfn|Talan|Treskanica|2009|p=371}} she spent several decades engaged in researching Croatian medieval history. Nada Klaić gathered the results of her extensive analytical investigations, published first in journals and proceedings, and monographs and surveys of Croatian history.{{sfn|Talan|Treskanica|2009|p=371}}

==Historical studies==
She researched the period from the arrival of the [[Slavic peoples|Slavs]] (see [[Migration Period]]) until the 19th century.{{sfn|Majnarić|2009}} Under the early influence of M. Barada, Lj. Hauptmann, [[Bogo Grafenauer|B. Grafenauer]] and J. Šidak, she contributed to the Croatian [[Medievalism]] by writing papers about social history.{{sfn|Majnarić|2009}} The book ''History of the [[Yugoslavia|Yugoslav]] Peoples II'' (1959) includes her comprehensive overview of the history of Croatia in the [[Early Modern Times]], including elements of economic and social history.{{sfn|Majnarić|2009}}

She paid special attention to the history of cities, as shown by several studies and books: ''[[Zadar]] in the Middle Ages until 1409'' (with Ivo Petricioli, 1976), ''[[Zagreb]] in the Middle Ages'' (1982), ''Notes on [[Vukovar]] in the Middle Ages'' (1983), ''[[Trogir]] in the Middle Ages: Public Life of the City and its Inhabitants'' (1985), ''[[Koprivnica]] in the Middle Ages'' (1987).{{sfn|Majnarić|2009}}

She authored numerous works regarding revolts and social conflicts, which she collected in the book ''Social Turmoil and [[Croatian and Slovenian peasant revolt|Revolts]] in Croatia in the 16th and 17th Centuries'' (1976).{{sfn|Majnarić|2009}} She described the role of specific nobles in the books ''The Last Dukes of [[Celje]] in the [[Lands of the Crown of St. Stephen]]'' (1982) and ''[[Medvedgrad]] and its Masters'' (1987).{{sfn|Majnarić|2009}}

Much of her work is the analysis and publication of historical sources.{{sfn|Majnarić|2009}} Relying partly on the contributions of earlier historians, she analyzed the entire Croatian diplomatic material of the [[Early Middle Ages]] (''Diplomatic Analysis of the Documents from the [[Medieval Croatian state (disambiguation)|Age of Croatian Rulers of Croat Descent]]'', 1965, 1966–67), questioning its authenticity.{{sfn|Majnarić|2009}} Along with the anonymous [[Split (city)|Split]] chronicle called ''[[Historia Salonitana maior]]'' (1967), Klaić published several sources translated from Latin for the needs of students (''Sources for Croatian History before 1526'', 1972).{{sfn|Majnarić|2009}} 

She provided a comprehensive and original concept of the early medieval development of the Croatian lands in the book ''History of the [[Croats]] in the [[Early Middle Ages]]'' (1971), while she collected her writings about numerous problems of the later period in the book ''History of the Croats in the [[High Middle Ages]]'' (1976).{{sfn|Majnarić|2009}} Her posthumously published books are ''[[History of Bosnia and Herzegovina (958–1463)|Medieval Bosnia]]: Political Status of Bosnian Rulers before the Coronation of [[Tvrtko I of Bosnia|Tvrtko]] in 1377'' (1989) and ''History of the Croats in the Middle Ages'' (1990).{{sfn|Majnarić|2009}}

==Influence==
Klaić was one of the most prominent Croatian and Yugoslavian medievalist in the 20th century. Some of her achievements are the innovative and modern approach to Croatian history (especially for the Middle Ages), which helped release it from the [[romantic nationalism]] of the 19th century,{{sfn|Majnarić|2009}} and the revaluation of older historical sources.{{sfn|Majnarić|2009}} However, a substantial portion of her views and conclusions are controversial and the work provoked strong reactions in historiography.{{sfn|Majnarić|2009}} For example, that the document [[Pacta conventa (Croatia)|Pacta conventa]] is a forgery probably made in the 14th century,&lt;ref name="Antoljak-1995"&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://hrcak.srce.hr/65458?lang=en|language=Croatian|title=Milan Sufflay kao paleograf i diplomatičar|first=Stjepan|last=Antoljak|pages=144–45|journal=Arhivski vjesnik|number=38|date=November 1995|issn=0570-9008|publisher=[[Croatian State Archives]]|accessdate=2012-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; her "lack of opinion" over the matter of 1102 in a 1959 article disputing Croatian writer Oleg Mandić's earlier work on the matter,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.historiografija.hr/hz/1960/HZ_13_27_KLAIC.pdf|language=Croatian|title=O. Mandić, "Pacta conventa" i "dvanaest" hrvatskih bratstava.|last=Klaić|first=Nada|journal=Historical Journal|publisher=Croatian Historical Society|issn=0351-2193|volume=XI-XII|year=1958–59|pages=165–206|accessdate=10 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and her view on the Croatian migration and old homeland in the 7th century, as well other topics of the early Croatian history.{{sfn|Majnarić|2009}} 

Klaić was highly critical about the work by some scholars like [[Ferdo Šišić]] (which she dismissed as poorly analysed), or Lj. Hauptmann (regarding the thesis of Croats migration from [[White Croatia]] and the Iranian-Caucasian theory of the origin of early Croats).{{sfn|Marčinko|2000|p=146-49}} Her firm assumptions on the origin and early homeland of Croats based on Margetić's thesis whereby the Croats arrived to Dalmatia in the late 8th or early 9th century, although Margetić emphasized it was only an assumption, which he later reportedly rejected.{{sfn|Marčinko|2000|p=155}} The German and Austrian scholars H. Kunstmann, J. Herrmann, R. Werner and O. Kronsteiner loose considerations on Slavs were especially influential on her viewpoints.{{sfn|Marčinko|2000|p=150, 155}}{{sfn|Heršak, Nikšić|2007|p=261}}

Klaić posited that there was no Slavic migration from North to South, but rather from South to North, as the Slavs were indigenous to the Balkan, therefore was no migration of the so-called [[White Croats]] from the White Croatia in [[Carantania]].{{sfn|Marčinko|2000|pp=147, 150}} She supported the thesis by H. Kunstmann that Slavs did not have their own tribal names, and their names should be traced to the Illyrian, Greek and Byzantine cultural milieu.{{sfn|Marčinko|2000|pp=150, 153}} She believed the Croats were Slavs in the Avar Khaganate ruled by the Avars, and as such firmly considered that Croatian state organization and titles [[župa]]n and [[Ban (title)|ban]] were of Avar origin.{{sfn|Marčinko|2000|pp=150-54}} She thought the discovered graves which dated from before the 9th century belonged to the Avars, not Croats,{{sfn|Marčinko|2000|p=152}} and that the Avars lived in Dalmatia.{{sfn|Marčinko|2000|pp=150-53}}

This and other views, such as the Gothic administrative origin of [[Liburnia]] and the existence of Avarian ''županijska Liburnia'', ''banska Liburnia'' and ''županijska [[Istria]]'',{{sfn|Marčinko|2000|p=152}} as well her constant consideration of incompetence of the archaeologists in the absence of proof for her theories,{{sfn|Marčinko|2000|p=152, 163}} were criticized and dismissed by modern scholars like N. Budak and [[Peter Štih|P. Štih]] as lacking bases in reliable evidence and sources.{{sfn|Marčinko|2000|pp=162-63}} [[Miroslav Brandt]] criticised Klaić as a protégé of socialist Yugoslavia in her approach to Croatian historiography.&lt;ref name="Brandt"&gt;{{cite book|first=Miroslav|last=Brandt|title=Život sa suvremenicima - političke uspomene i svjetonazor|trans-title=Living with contemporaries – political memories and worldview|language=Croatian|publisher=Naklada Pavičić|place=Zagreb|year=1996|isbn=953-6308-22-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Heršak, Nikšić|2007|p=261}}&lt;ref name="Brandt"/&gt;{{sfn|Heršak, Nikšić|2007|p=261}}

'''Nikodim Milaš''' ({{lang-sr-cyr|Никодим Милаш}}; 1845–1915) was a [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] [[bishop]] in [[Dalmatia]] (nowaday [[Croatia]]). He was a writer and perhaps the greatest [[Serbia]]n expert on [[church law]] and the [[Slavonia|Slavic]] world.{{Citation needed|date=October 2008}}. As a canon lawyer in Dalmatia, he defended the Serbian Orthodox Church against the State. He was a [[polyglot]], fluent in German, Italian, Latin, Russian, Greek, and [[Old Church Slavonic|Old Slavonic]], and an author of numerous books.

==Biography==

Bishop Nikodim Milaš was born at [[Šibenik]] in Dalmatia (then part of the [[Austro-Hungarian Empire]]) on 4 April 1845 to Trifun and Maria Milaš (Serbian father and Italian mother). He was baptized Nikola. After attending the Jesuit Gymnasium in [[Zadar]] and graduating from the Serbian Orthodox Theological School at [[Sremski Karlovci]], he studied at the oldest college of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], the [[Kievan Theological Academy]] and Seminary (then part of [[Imperial Russia]]), and in 1871 took a master's degree in [[Canon Law]] and Church History, the fruit of which, his remarkable dissertation, ''Nomocanon of [[Photios I of Constantinople|Patriarch Photius]]'', brought him the golden cross of the [[Russian Orthodox Church]]. Upon his return home, Serbian Orthodox Bishop Stefan (Knežević) of Dalmatia appointed him professor of canon law at Zadar's Theological Orthodox Institute. In 1872, he published a study in which he criticized the Austro-Hungarian government for interfering in the life of the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] and its faithful.

Professor Nikola Milaš was [[tonsure]]d in 1873 and given the [[monastic name]] of Nikodim. Also, he was ordained [[deacon]], and two years later, [[presbyter]]. He received the rank [[archimandrite]] in 1880. Under his administration the theological institute in Zadar became one of the best Orthodox schools. Nikodim corresponded with the greatest Eastern Orthodox and Roman Catholic canonists at the time: Alexis Stepanovich Pavloff (d. 1898), Alexander Theodorovich Lavroff, Vasili Vasilievich Bolotoff, [[Pietro Gasparri]], [[Emil Albert Friedberg]], [[Joseph Putzer]], [[Friedrich Heinrich Vering]]. After the publication of his ([[hornbook]]), "''Principles of Jurisdiction in the Eastern Orthodox Church,''" in which he again levelled criticism on the Austro-Hungarian authorities, he was forced to take refuge in [[Belgrade]] in late 1885. There for the next two years, he was the [[rector (academia)|rector]] of the Belgrade Seminary (''[[Bogoslovija]]''). In early 1888 he was back in Zadar where he completed that same year two major works: "''Roman Catholic Propaganda: its foundation and rules today''" (1889) and his six-volume treatise on the Serbian Orthodox Church entitled "''Orthodox Church and Canon Law''" (1890). He liked Zadar, and the people would habe been glad to keep him; but the attraction of a Belgrade post carried him back there in the autumn of 1888. He was appointed Professor of Canon law and Church History at the [[Belgrade]]'s [[Grande école]] (''Velika škola'') and Bogoslovija (Theological Seminary). Two years later, when Bishop Stefan Knezević of Dalmatia died, Nikodim was elected Bishop of Dalmatia on 10 July 1890 and consecrated on 16 September 1890. Throughout his tenure he was under pressure from anti-Serb Orthodox authorities and forced to endure aggressive Roman Catholic [[proselytism]]. Bishop Nikodim collaborated with politician [[Sava Bjelanović]] during that difficult period. He once wrote:

"''Nije lak posao vladici u Dalmaciji i sa takozvanom pravoslavnom inteligencijom. Ovi i ovakvi ljudi prinudili su dalmatinske episkope Rajačića, Živkovića i Mutibarića da bježe iz Dalmacije u druge eparhije. ... Ali najteže je dalmatinskom episkopu sa Vladom, ako hoće da bude pravi pravoslavni episkop i čuvar vjere i crkve svoje. U Austriji od 1868. vlada zakon da pravoslavlje uživa jednaka prava kao i sve ostale priznate državne konfesije. Ali u samoj stvari ta je crkva u Austriji samo tolerirana.''"

"The bishop's job in Dalmatia is not an easy one and with a so-called Orthodox [[intelligentsia]] (many of whom were Roman Catholic, though declared themselves as Serbs). Those and like folk have caused  Dalmatian bishops such as [[Josif Rajačić]], Pantelejmon Živković and Jerotije Mutibarić to flee from Dalmatia and seek refuge in other diocese.... But what is really difficult for a bishop is to deal with State officials, if he wants to be a true Orthodox bishop and defender of his faith and church. In Austria there is a rule since 1868 that Orthodoxy has the same position as all other confessions in the State. But the truth of the matter is that the Church (Orthodox) is just tolerated."

In 1901 Nikodim published "''Orthodoxy in Dalmatia''" in answer to a [[papal encyclical]] in which Pope [[Leo XIII]] appealed for union. His book was criticized by the bishop of the [[Eparchy of Križevci]], who wrote:

''Nobody hates Union as much as Orthodox Dalmatians (meaning Serbs).''

Nikodim also had problems with his superiors. He refused elevation to the [[Holy Synod]] (the executive body of the Serbian Orthodox Church) of Belgrade and later of Sarajevo because he was not elected according to canon law. Always under constant pressure from civil authorities and other enemies, Nikodim was forced to retire in early 1912. He was succeeded by Bishop Dimitrije Branković.

Bishop Nikodim died at Dubrovnik on 12 April 1915. The only copy of his new book -- "''The Church and the State in the Austro-Hungarian Empire''"—has since disappeared.

==Legacy==
Nikodim Milaš grew up in a region where [[jurisprudence]] was founded on [[Roman law|Roman]] and [[Byzantine]] law. His extensive and exact legal erudition, and the skill with which he wrote about the complex canonical laws, soon brought him a reputation never before equalled, and caused him to be universally recognized as the greatest Eastern Orthodox canon lawyer of his day. Most of his work was translated into Russian, German, Romanian, Bulgarian and Greek, and has greatly influenced modern Orthodox [[canonists]], including I. Bogović, C. Metrović, Professor S. Troitsky (the Russian-Serbian canonist), Branko Cisarž (d. 1982), and Dimsho Perić (d. 2007), who wrote studies on the history of church-state relations in Serbia. Nikodim produced a number of collections of canonical texts, and was particularly interested in the churches of North Africa in the Roman period. He translated ''The Constitution (Syntagma) of the Divine and Sacred Canons'' by Rallis and Potlis, and placed his commentaries in the context of previous Biblical [[hermeneutic]] works. He had a good deal to say about Church-State relations, a subject which preoccupied most of his life.

He is included in [[The 100 most prominent Serbs]].

'''Paleoradiology''' (ancient radiology) is the study of [[archeology|archaeological]] remains through the use of [[Radiography|radiographic]] techniques, such as [[X-ray]], [[CT scan|CT]] (computer tomography) and [[X-ray microtomography|micro-CT]] scans.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chhem|first=Rethy|date=2004|title=Paleoradiology: current status and future challenges|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/docview/235996145?pq-origsite=summon|journal=Canadian Association of Radiologists Journal|volume=55|pages=198–199|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is predominately used by archaeologists and [[anthropology|anthropologists]] to examine [[mummy|mummified]] remains due to its non-invasive nature.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Paleoradiologists can discover post-mortem damage to the body, or any artefacts buried with them, while still keeping the remains intact. Radiological images can also contribute evidence about the person's life, such as their age and cause of death. The first recorded use of paleoradiology (although not by that name) was in 1896, just a year after the Rōntgen radiograph was first produced.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Although this method of viewing ancient remains is advantageous due to its non-invasive manner, many radiologists lack expertise in archeology and very few radiologists can identify ancient diseases which may be present.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Techniques ==

=== CT ===
{{Main|CT scan}}
CT scans are most commonly used in paleoradiological studies because they can create images of soft tissue, organs and body cavities of mummified remains without performing an invasive and damaging autopsy.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hoffman|first=Heidi|last2=Torres|first2=William E.|last3=Ernst|first3=Randy D.|date=2002|title=Paleoradiology: Advanced CT in the Evaluation of Nine Egyptian Mummies|journal=RadioGraphics|volume=22|issue=2|pages=377–385|doi=10.1148/radiographics.22.2.g02mr13377|pmid=11896227|issn=0271-5333}}&lt;/ref&gt; This enables archaeologists and anthropologists to digitally unwrap the remains and reveal what they contain. CT scanners create these images by taking multiple radiographic planes (or cuts) of the body at different angles which records the layers of different structures in the remains. This differs from typical [[Radiography|radiographic scans]] (X-rays) where all the structural layers are documented in one image, which can create shadows and therefore limit their accuracy.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|last=Brothwell|first=D|last2=Chhem|first2=R|date=2008|title=Paleoradiology Imaging Mummies and Fossils|url=https://link-springer-com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/content/pdf/10.1007/978-3-540-48833-0.pdf|journal=|publisher=Springer|volume=|pages=|doi=10.1007/978-3-540-48833-0|via=|isbn=978-3-540-48832-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

There are several main viewing techniques used in CT imaging.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://sites.google.com/a/wisc.edu/neuroradiology/image-acquisition/the-basics|title=The Basics - Neuroradiology|publisher=University of Wisconsin|date=2018|website=sites.google.com|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* Axial Imaging: images that are taken from transverse planes, cutting across the body. This provides information about the chest, abdomen and pelvic area of the body, as well as the cranium.
* Sagittal Imaging: images taken from the left or right sides of the body. This gives a greater indication of the length of fractures found on the remains. Together with axial imaging it can create a greater depth of visual understanding of the interior of the body.
* Coronal Imaging: images are taken from the back to the front of the body. This can provide a more accurate indication of the presence of organs in the chest cavity (e.g. the heart).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

[[File:The Wormian Inca bone.png|thumb|A 3D image of the skull of an Incan mummy]]
After these different views of the remains have been obtained, it is possible to create a three-dimensional reconstruction of the body. This brings into focus details which may have been missed on the axial imagining. [[Algorithm]] manipulation is used to create the rotational 3D images.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; In paleoradiology, the 3D images provide a greater understanding of the remains themselves. For example, in 2002, a study of nine Egyptian mummies found that by using the 3D reconstructions they could see the preservation of soft tissues, such as the penis on one male body and braided hair on female remains. The 3D modelling also illustrated discrepancies between the remains, as some had their internal organs removed while others had not.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

Due to their ability to take multiple planes of the remains, CT scans are able to virtually 'fly through' the body to assess internal composition and cavities.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cosmacini|first=P|last2=Piacentini|first2=P|date=2008|title=Notes on the history of the radiological study of Egyptian mummies: from X-rays to new imaging techniques|url=https://link-springer-com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/content/pdf/10.1007/s11547-008-0280-7.pdf|journal=La Radiologia Medica|volume=113|issue=5|pages=615–626|doi=10.1007/s11547-008-0280-7|pmid=18523844|via=Springer}}&lt;/ref&gt; These techniques are commonly used for diagnostic scans such as [[colonoscopy]] and [[bronchoscopy]], and the same method is applied to ancient remains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This enables researchers to digitally look through the remains from the top down, as though they were watching a short video of footage from the interior of the body. The technique presents observable data from the hollow cavities in the chest and abdomen regions. It can demonstrate whether there are internal organs present or if, in the case of Egyptian mummies, linen has been packed to maintain the body shape of the remains.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==== Micro-CT ====
{{Main|Micro-CT}}Micro-CT is a specialised form of CT scan used to create images with pixels in micrometres. These images are frequently used for bone density examinations and produce greater detail for images of bony structures. This radiology technique is often used to examine the teeth from mummified remains.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chhem|first=Rethy K.|date=2006-06-08|title=Paleoradiology: imaging disease in mummies and ancient skeletons|journal=Skeletal Radiology|volume=35|issue=11|pages=803–804|doi=10.1007/s00256-006-0144-y|pmid=16847646|issn=0364-2348}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early use (1895&amp;ndash;1970)==
[[File:Mummified cats.jpg|thumb|Two mummified Egyptian cats with a radiograph of the cat on the left|alt=]]
Radiographs, or X-rays, have been used to study and observe ancient remains since their invention by [[Wilhelm Röntgen]] in 1895. This early form of X-ray, sometimes known as Röntgenograms, was immediately used by physicists, anthropologists, anatomists and archaeologists as shown below.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boni|first=Thomas|last2=Chhem|first2=Rethy|date=2004|title=History of paleoradiology: early published literature, 1896-1921|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/docview/235982587/fulltext/E876D2B50A9948B1PQ/1?accountid=14757|journal=Canadian Association of Radiologists Journal|volume=55|issue=4|pages=203–210|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

* 1896; Carl Georg Walter Koenig, a German physicist, took images of an Egyptian child mummy as well as an Egyptian mummified cat. Fourteen images were taken using a very early form of X-ray, which Koenig realised could be used for more than just medical purposes.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Beckett|first=Ronald G.|date=2014-02-28|title=Paleoimaging: a review of applications and challenges|journal=Forensic Science, Medicine, and Pathology|volume=10|issue=3|pages=423–436|doi=10.1007/s12024-014-9541-z|pmid=24682794|issn=1547-769X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

* 1897; [[Albert Londe]], a French physicist, took radiographic images of an Egyptian mummy. From these images he was able to determine the presence of artefacts placed in the mummy's wrappings, such as decorative jewellery on the body (e.g. rings), as well as the approximate bone age of the remains by examining the growth plates. Londe’s thorough examination of the pictures demonstrated how ancient remains could be studied without damaging the wrappings and body.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
* 1898; Charles Lester Leonard and Stewart Culin conducted a radiographic examination of a [[Moche culture|Mochica mummy]] (Peruvian mummy). The mummy had been tightly wrapped and was left unopened to preserve its integrity. Leonard determined that the body was of a child who had been decorated in beads before burial.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* 1901&amp;ndash;1902; [[Dragutin Gorjanović-Kramberger|Karl Gorjanovic-Kramberger]] took images of Palaeolithic skeletons found in Croatia. By comparing the X-rays of the jaw of these remains with X-rays from a modern man he was able to determine differences between the two. The X-ray of the Palaeolithic jaw was also used to measure the length of the teeth.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

[[File:Tutankhamunxray.jpg|thumb|An X-ray of Tutankhamun's skull, the arrow pointing to a possible cause of death]]

* 1905; [[Heinrich Albers-Schönberg|Heinrich Ernst Albers-Schoenberg]] used the radiological method to examine an Egyptian mummy. He discovered that there was a substance in the thorax and pelvis which had most likely been placed there for mummification purposes. He was also able to determine the perseveration of soft tissues around the nose and mouth as well as details within the skull and the state of the spine, which was wholly intact.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

* 1912; [[Grafton Elliot Smith|Sir Grafton Elliot Smith]] examined the mummy of Egyptian pharaoh [[Thutmose IV|Thutmosis IV]] and was able to suggest an approximate bone age from these images. He recommended in his publication on the mummy that the use of radiology would be able to provide greater detail to the study of the remains in the future.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;
* 1921; F. Salomon studied a Peruvian mummy using X-rays, determining the bone age and the bone structure of the remains. He discovered that the remains were of a child around 2&amp;ndash;3 years old, and bone structure was at a normal developmental stage for this age.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;
*1933; X-ray imaging was used on Egyptian pharaoh [[Amenhotep I]] by Douglas Derry to discover the age of death. It was approximated to be 40&amp;ndash;50 based on the wear and condition of the teeth. Derry also noted post-mortem damage to the body, which has been attributed to grave robbers, as well as amulets and beads used to decorate the remains during mummification.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;
*1968; A portable X-ray machine was used to examine the mummy of [[Tutankhamun]] in his tomb in the [[Valley of the Kings]] by researcher R. G. Harrison. These images indicated an age of death of around 18&amp;ndash;20 years based on bone age from a study of the limb lengths, as well as tooth analysis. The rumoured cause of death of tuberculosis was also ruled out during this study. A new hypothesis was formed that Tutankhamun died because of blunt force trauma to the head, due to a depressed fracture found on the skull.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Current use in archaeology ==
CT scans are the most common radiological technique used in modern archaeology due to their ability to provide more detailed information about ancient remains (such as soft tissue and blood vessels) and to produce 3D images by taking layers of different angled pictures. Archaeologists are able to collect data such as age, sex, the cause of death, socioeconomic status, mummification and burial practices by analysing the CT images. The images can also reveal whether the remains were subject to ancient diseases or post-mortem damage.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Although paleoradiology practices are used on preserved remains such as European [[Bog body|bog bodies]] and frozen bodies from the High Andes, they are more frequently documented in the analysis of Egyptian mummified remains.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Boni|first=Thomas|last2=Chhem|first2=Rethy|date=2004|title=Diagnostic paleoradiology of mummified tissue: interpretation and pitfalls|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/docview/236112998?pq-origsite=summon|journal=Canadian Association of Radiologists Journal|volume=55|issue=4|pages=218–227|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Egyptology ===
[[File:Statue Paramesses Munich.JPG|thumb|Statue of Paramesses (later known as Ramesses I), pharaoh of Egypt during the 20th dynasty of New Kingdom Egypt]]
CT scans are used in [[Egyptology]] to gain insight into mummified bodies without risking damage to the integrity of the remains. Hoffman's recent study of nine Egyptian remains discovered new information regarding the mummification practices of Egyptians. The typical process of [[Mummification in Ancient Egypt|mummification]], as written by [[Herodotus]], involves the removal of the four major internal organs (liver, intestines, lungs and stomach) and placement of them in four [[Canopic jar|canopic jars]]. The heart is removed, embalmed and placed back into the body as it is an important feature in the journey to the [[Ancient Egyptian religion|Egyptian afterlife]]. However, Hoffman discovered that this was not the case in all mummies. Through analysis of CT-produced 3D images, the "fly-through" technique and a combination of axial and coronal images, it was discovered that four of the remains had not had their internal organs removed and in another four the heart could not be identified.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Hoffman suggests this may be due to socioeconomic differences between the mummies during the time they were alive. CT scans were further used in Hoffman's study to potentially identify one of the remains as [[Ramesses I]], a Pharaoh during [[New Kingdom of Egypt|New Kingdom Egypt]]. It was found that the mummification practices of this particular body were in conjunction with those typically used during the New Kingdom period, as images showed rolled linen placed inside the body in order to preserve its shape. The mummy's arms were also found to be placed across the chest as a symbol of nobility.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Imaging done by Rethy Chhem, in 2004, was able to correct a diagnosis of Ramesses II from X-rays done in 1976. The incorrect diagnosis had been of [[ankylosing spondylitis]], a form of arthritis. However, Chhem perceived that the pharaoh actually had [[diffuse idiopathic skeletal hyperostosis]], a calcification of the joints causing ligaments to attach to the spine.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The CT images provided a clearer and more detailed image of the spine when compared with the early X-rays. This enabled the researchers to provide a greater insight into diseases found in ancient remains and achieve a more accurate diagnosis. 

A recent CT scan of Tutankhamun in 2006 was able to provide evidence against the 'homicide theory'.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; A depression fracture noted on the skull from X-rays taken 30 years previously was found to be a post-mortem injury rather than a cause of death.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The hole in the head had been created in order to continue the embalming process of mummification.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; This CT investigation was also able to confirm Tutankhamun's age of death as nineteen and disprove the idea that the young pharaoh had suffered from [[scoliosis]]; rather the bend in his spine was from additional post-mortem damage to the body.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

== Disadvantages ==
Although the information and evidence gathered by radiological imaging of ancient remains have been largely beneficial to the fields of archaeology and anthropology, not all of the information can be considered accurate due to the lack of radiologists who specialise in [[paleopathology]]. Instead, to obtain the most information from CT or X-ray images a team must meet to discuss the findings (e.g. for a skeletal study of the remains, an orthopaedic surgeon, bone pathologist and musculoskeletal radiologist would meet).&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; Another disadvantage to this technique is the low contrast resolution. The researcher may be unable to determine a difference between soft tissue and artefacts left from the embalming process. Due to the decomposed state of some of the mummified remains, it can also be difficult to distinguish internal organs due to shrinkage and a lack of preservation. Post-mortem injuries and damage to the body can also hinder the ability of radiological scans to provide accurate information for researchers. For example, in frozen remains, there can difficulty when differentiating whether a CT suggests the body has air-inflated lung tissue or if there is frozen fluid in the lungs.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; 

Paleoradiology is informative in its ability to assist in determining the age of death of the remains, however, this is not always completely accurate or available information. In a sample of bog bodies, 35% were not able to be identified with any age group and 30% could not be sex determined. A radiological study of an iceman was only able to produce an estimate of 40&amp;ndash;50 years at age of death. In order to achieve a more accurate time frame, the body would have to be subject to an autopsy or similar physical assessment which would cause irreversible damage to the remains.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Another disadvantage of paleoradiology is the difficulty in transporting the equipment or the artefact/remains to spaces where the images can be taken.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Eppenberger|first=Patrick E.|last2=Cavka|first2=Mislav|last3=Habicht|first3=Michael E.|last4=Galassi|first4=Francesco M.|last5=Rühli|first5=Frank|date=2018-06-20|title=Radiological findings in ancient Egyptian canopic jars: comparing three standard clinical imaging modalities (x-rays, CT and MRI)|journal=European Radiology Experimental|language=en|volume=2|issue=1|pages=12|doi=10.1186/s41747-018-0048-3|issn=2509-9280|pmc=6008346|pmid=29951641}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in 2005 the mummy of Tutankhamun was imaged using a CT-scanner which had to be brought from the [[Cairo Museum]] to [[tomb KV62]] in the [[Valley of the Kings]].&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hawass|first=Zahi|date=2013|title=The Death of Tutankhamun|url=https://search-proquest-com.ezproxy1.library.usyd.edu.au/docview/1469896500?OpenUrlRefId=info:xri/sid:summon&amp;accountid=14757|journal=International Journal on Humanistic Ideology|volume=6|issue=1|pages=13–27|via=ProQuest}}&lt;/ref&gt; This was due to the fragile state of the remains which were unable to be removed from the climate-controlled tomb. In this study, funding came from  a five-year grant from the [[Supreme Council of Antiquities]], which was aided by the donation of a Siemens CT-scanner by the [[National Geographic Society]],&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; however typically funding for research can be problematic as equipment is costly and there may not be sufficient interest to prompt donations.

[[Image:Hamlet William Morris Hunt.jpeg|thumb|200px|[[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Hamlet]], Prince of Denmark.'' William Morris Hunt, oil on canvas, circa 1864]]
A '''protagonist''' ({{ety|grc|''πρωταγωνιστής'' (protagonistes)|one who plays the first part, chief actor}}) &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.04.0057%3Aentry%3Dprwtagwnisth%2Fs πρωταγωνιστής], Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, ''A Greek-English Lexicon'', on Perseus Digital Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dictionary.com/browse/protagonist "protagonist"]. [[Dictionary.com]], [[Random House]]. Retrieved November 17, 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; is the leading character of a story.

The protagonist is at the center of the story, makes the key decisions, and experiences the consequences of those decisions. The protagonist is the primary agent propelling the story forward, and is often the character who faces the most significant obstacles. If a story contains a [[subplot]], or is a narrative made up of several stories, then each subplot may have its own protagonist.&lt;ref&gt;Duncan, Stephen. ''A Guide to Screenwriting Success: Writing for Film and Television''. Rowman &amp; Littlefield (2006) {{ISBN|9780742553019}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The protagonist is the character whose fate is most closely followed by the reader or audience, and who is opposed by the [[antagonist]]. The antagonist will provide obstacles and complications and create conflicts that test the protagonist, thus revealing the strengths and weaknesses of the protagonist's character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?search=protagonist&amp;searchmode=none|title=protagonist - Search Online Etymology Dictionary|website=www.etymonline.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Ancient Greece==
The earliest known examples of a protagonist are found in [[Ancient Greece]]. At first, dramatic performances involved merely dancing and recitation by the chorus. Then in ''[[Poetics (Aristotle)|Poetics]]'', [[Aristotle]] describes how a poet named [[Thespis]] introduced the idea of one actor stepping out and engage in a dialogue with the chorus. This was the invention of tragedy, and occurred about 536 B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Müller, K.O. ''History of the literature of Ancient Greece''. [Library of Useful Knowledge.] Society for the Diffusion of Useful Knowledge. London (1840) page 306&lt;/ref&gt; Then the poet [[Aeschylus]], in his plays, introduced a second actor, inventing the idea of dialogue between two characters. [[Sophocles]] then wrote plays that included a third actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/art/protagonist|title=Protagonist - literature|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Aristotle. ''Poetics''. Oxford University Press (January 20, 2013) {{ISBN|978-0199608362}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[William Packard (author)|Packard, William]]. ''The Art of the Playwright''. Thunder’s Mouth Press. 1997 {{ISBN|1-56025-117-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Storey, Ian. Allan, Arlene. ''A Guide to Ancient Greek Drama''. John Wiley &amp; Sons (2008) {{ISBN|9781405137638}}. page 84&lt;/ref&gt;

A description of the protagonist's origin cited that during the early period of Greek drama, the protagonist served as the author, the director, and the actor and that these roles were only separated and allocated to different individuals later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=0jhjDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT235&amp;dq=protagonist+definition+classical+greece&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjDk7mB5PPeAhUmrlQKHXCxDT4Q6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=protagonist%20definition%20classical%20greece&amp;f=false|title=Moreno's Personality Theory and its Relationship to Psychodrama: A Philosophical, Developmental and Therapeutic Perspective|last=Telias|first=Rozei|date=2018-07-06|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781351021081|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is also a claim that the poet did not assign or create the protagonist as well as other terms for actors such as ''deuteragonist'' and ''tritagonist'' primarily because he only gave actors their appropriate part.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com.ph/books?id=lgpaDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT513&amp;dq=protagonist+protagonistes+classical+greece&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjL0faS5PPeAhXT0J8KHbm9DSkQ6AEIKTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=protagonist%20protagonistes%20classical%20greece&amp;f=false|title=History of the Literature of Ancient Greece|last=Bart|first=M. P.|date=2018-03-22|publisher=Charles River Editors|isbn=9781632956316|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, these actors were assigned their specific areas at the stage with the protagonist always entering from the middle door or that the dwelling of the ''[[deuteragonist]]'' (second most important character) should be on the right hand, and the ''[[tritagonist]]'' (third most important character), the left.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

In Ancient Greece, the protagonist is distinguished from the term "hero", which was used to refer to a human who became a semi-divine being. in the narrative.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A Guide to Ancient Greek Drama|last=Storey|first=Ian|last2=Allan|first2=Arlene|publisher=Blackwell Publishing|year=2008|isbn=1405102144|location=Malden, MA|pages=84}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Examples==

[[Euripides]]' play ''[[Hippolytus (play)|Hippolytus]]'' may be considered to have two protagonists. Phaedra is the protagonist of the first half, who dies partway through the play. Her stepson, the titular Hippolytus, assumes the dominant role in the second half of the play.&lt;ref&gt;Euripides. ''Hippolytos''. Oxford University Press (October 29, 1992) {{ISBN|978-0195072907}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Ibsen]]’s play ''[[The Master Builder]]'', the protagonist is the architect Halvard Solness. The young woman, Hilda Wangel, whose actions lead to the death of Solness, is the antagonist.&lt;ref&gt;Ibsen, Henrik. Meyer, Michael Leverson. editor. ''Ibsen Plays: 1: Ghosts; The Wild Duck; The Master Builder''. Dramatists Play Service Inc. (1980) {{ISBN|9780413463302}}. page 241&lt;/ref&gt;

In Shakespeare’s play ''[[Romeo and Juliet]]'', Romeo is the protagonist. He is actively in pursuit of his relationship with Juliet, and the audience is invested in that story. Tybalt, as an antagonist, opposes Romeo and attempts to thwart the relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, William. ''Romeo and Juliet''. Bloomsbury Arden Shakespeare; Third edition (July 15, 2012) {{ISBN|9781903436912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Shakespeare’s play ''[[Hamlet]]'', Prince Hamlet, who seeks revenge for the murder of his father, is the protagonist. The antagonist would be the character who most opposes Hamlet, Claudius (though, in many ways, Hamlet is his own antagonist).&lt;ref&gt;Shakespeare, William. ''Hamlet''. Simon &amp; Schuster (July 1, 1992) {{ISBN|978-0743477123}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes, a work will have a [[false protagonist]], who may seem to be the protagonist, but then may disappear unexpectedly. The character Marion in [[Alfred Hitchcock]]'s film ''[[Psycho (1960 film)|Psycho]]'' (1960) is an example.&lt;ref&gt;Kolker, Robert Phillip. ''Alfred Hitchcock's Psycho: A Casebook''. Oxford University Press (2004) {{ISBN|9780195169195}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A novel that contains a number of narratives may have a number of protagonists. [[Alexander Solzhenitsyn]]'s ''[[The First Circle]]'', for example, depicts a variety of characters imprisoned and living in a [[gulag]] camp.&lt;ref&gt;''The Solzhenitsyn Reader: New and Essential Writings, 1947–2005: Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn'', Edward E. Ericson, Jr., Daniel J. Mahoney.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leo Tolstoy]]'s ''[[War and Peace]]'', depicts fifteen major characters involved in or affected by a war.&lt;ref&gt;Moser, Charles. 1992. ''Encyclopedia of Russian Literature''. Cambridge University Press. pp. 298–300.&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Little Women]]'' boasts a cast of over five diverse females struggling with the inevitability of the crossing between childhood and womenhood.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.worldcat.org/oclc/14932247|title=A hunger for home : Louisa May Alcott's place in American culture|last=Sarah.|first=Elbert,|date=1987|publisher=Rutgers University Press|isbn=0813511992|location=New Brunswick|oclc=14932247}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Charlotte Brontë]]'s novel ''[[Jane Eyre]]'', Jane's spiritual and emotional growth captivate the social criticism of its day, exploring heavy subjects such as [[classism]], [[Human sexuality|sexuality]], [[religion]], and [[proto-feminism]] during the early 1800s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Charlotte Brontë's Novels: The Accents of Persuasion|last=Martin|first=Robert B|publisher=Norton|year=1996|isbn=|location=NY|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Peter and Wendy]], ''[[Wendy Darling]]'' is the protagonist.

In some cases, the protagonist is not a human: in [[Richard Adams]]' novel ''[[Watership Down]],'' a group of [[Anthropomorphism|anthropomorphised]] rabbits, led by the protagonist Hazel, escape their warren after seeing a vision of its destruction, starting a perilous journey to find a new home.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, Richard, 1920-2016. Watership Down. London :Rex Collings Ltd, 1972. Print.&lt;/ref&gt;

Langlands moved to the University of Exeter in 1998 to teach in the Department of Classics.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://shc.stanford.edu/events/dr-rebecca-langlands-ucla|title=Dr. Rebecca Langlands (UCLA)|last=Anonymous|date=2014-11-10|work=Stanford Humanities|access-date=2018-08-23|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was awarded a grant from the [[Arts and Humanities Research Council]] for the project ''Pudicitia: Sexual Ethics in Ancient Rome'' in February–June 2003 under its Research Leave scheme.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://impact.ref.ac.uk/CaseStudies/CaseStudy.aspx?Id=37315|title=REF Case study search|website=impact.ref.ac.uk|language=en|access-date=2018-08-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langlands was a visiting faculty member (2014/15) at UCLA Department of Classics.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

Langlands works on morality in the Roman world, stemming from her doctoral work on Valerius Maximus. More recently, she has focused on gender and sexuality in the ancient world generally. Langlands co-directs the project ''Sexual Knowledge, Sexual History'' with Kate Fisher and also co-directs the ''Sex and History'' project, which uses objects from history to facilitate discussion of modern sexual issues with young people.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://sexandhistory.exeter.ac.uk/|title=Sex &amp; History {{!}} Talking sex with objects from the past|website=sexandhistory.exeter.ac.uk|language=en-GB|access-date=2018-09-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Langlands has co-written a chapter in The Palgrave Handbook of Sexuality Education on "‘Sex and History’: Talking Sex with Objects from the Past" about the project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Fisher|first=Kate|title=‘Sex and History’: Talking Sex with Objects from the Past|date=2016|url=http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/books/NBK493585/|work=The Palgrave Handbook of Sexuality Education|editor-last=Allen|editor-first=Louisa|series=Wellcome Trust–Funded Monographs and Book Chapters|publisher=Palgrave Macmillan|isbn=9781137400321|pmid=29668201|access-date=2018-08-23|last2=Grove|first2=Jen|last3=Langlands|first3=Rebecca|editor2-last=Rasmussen|editor2-first=Mary Lou}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Garb (costume)===
A basic requirement of a [[Society for Creative Anachronism]] (SCA) event is that everyone wear clothing similar to that worn before 1601 AD.&lt;ref name='govdocs'&gt;SCA Governing Documents - {{cite web |url=http://www.sca.org/docs/govdocs.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2007-04-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070212042842/http://sca.org/docs/govdocs.pdf |archivedate=2007-02-12 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Within the SCA, the term for this type of period clothing is "garb", and there can be a very wide range in the time period, style and level of authenticity. Members often have "field" garb, simple cotton tunics or gowns that they wear to camping or other outdoor events, and "court" garb made of expensive brocades and silks that are reserved for formal events. Many SCA members make their own clothing, but can also purchase their garb from merchants or barter with other SCA members. Newcomers to the SCA can usually borrow garb for their first event or two by contacting the local group's Gold Key officer or Chatelaine/Castellan, who is responsible for helping acclimatize new members.

===Martial activities===
[[Image:SCA heavy combat at Pennsic 38.jpg|thumb|300px|Fighters practising at Pennsic XXXVII (2009). Note the use of rattan swords and edge padding on the shields.]]
The SCA recreates three forms of martial activities, including "heavy" armoured combat, [[fencing]] and [[archery]].  Armoured combat focuses on recreating [[tournament (medieval)|medieval tournament]] culture through courteous, chivalric displays of skill in practice, tournament and melee scenarios.  SCA fencing employs a form of heavy rapier fencing built upon techniques outlined in [[German school of fencing|German]] and [[Italian school of swordsmanship|Italian Renaissance]] era (15th-16th century) fencing manuals.  Archery activities in the SCA include both target archery and combat archery, using equipment modified for safety in conjunction with armoured combat during melee scenarios.

'''[[SCA Heavy Combat|Armoured Combat]]''' (sometimes referred to as "Heavy Combat", "Heavy List", or "Heavy Fighting") using weapons fashioned to generally approximate the [[sword]]-and-[[shield]], [[greatsword]], [[spear]], [[glaive]] and [[halberd]] of the High [[Middle Ages]].

[[SCA fencing|Fencing]] or '''Rapier Combat''', generally approximating the lightly armored "swashbuckling" of the 15th century and the 16th century, emphasizing the [[rapier]] over cutting swords. Many members of the Society study and practice period manuals from the salons of Western Europe whose Sword Masters taught the "Arte of Defence", where the term "fencing" came from.
 
'''Combat [[Archery]]''' using bows and crossbows has been a part of Society combat from the early days as well, and currently is highly regulated for safety concerns.  It is not allowed in tournaments, but only in war or melee scenarios.  The arrows used have specially designed tips and tails for safety, and the equipment has limits placed on how powerful it can be.

'''Thrown Weapons''' are also allowed in wars and melees.  This can include [[Javelin|javelins]], knives, axes, throwing maces, and other weapons.  A weapon must meet certain extra safety requirements (of weight and padding) to be allowed to be thrown.

'''Siege Combat''' is the reproduction of large siege engines for use in wars and melees, such as the [[onager]], [[ballista]], and [[trebuchet]].  The engines are obviously scaled down in size and power and shoot safe ammunition such as tennis balls.

The [[martial arts]] as practiced in the SCA are notable in that there are no referees to declare a winner. "Marshals" are on the field to maintain safety (e.g. watch for loose or broken equipment or to protect bystanders). It is the combatants who acknowledge the effect of blows. A combatant is on his or her own honor to "call" a "good shot", feigning its effect. For example, a good blow to the arm renders that arm useless, so the combatant will stop using it for the duration of the fight. Calling a leg shot, the combatant drops to his or her knees.

===Armored combat===

{{Main|SCA Armoured Combat}}

The Armored Combat or "Heavy Weapons Fighting" forms practiced in the SCA roughly mirror those of medieval infantry, and both [[Tournament (medieval)|tournaments]] and battles are fought. The fighters wear [[armor]] (often of their own making) made of plastic, leather, or steel, or any combination thereof. 

As a full-contact sport; moves are not planned or signaled and fighters strike each other with considerable force and speed. Weapons are primarily made of [[rattan]] to resemble [[sword]]s, [[Pike (weapon)|pike]]s, [[spear]]s, [[axe]]s and other medieval weapon types. [[Mace (bludgeon)|Mace]]s and axes have heads made of rubber or stiff foam, and pole weapons (resembling medieval [[pole-axe]]s, [[glaive]]s, [[halberd]]s or bills, etc.) may or may not be required to be similarly padded, depending upon the regulations in a given SCA kingdom.

For the purposes of calling blows, all heavy-weapons combatants are considered to be armored in a [[chain mail]] [[hauberk]], with an open-faced [[helmet]] with a nasal.  For that reason, a draw cut or glancing blow would have no effect, while a solid blow would. (Mail protects well against a slicing blade; it transmits most of the force of a blow.) Good strikes to the torso and head are treated as a 'killing blow'.

Most SCA fighters use a one-handed weapon in combination with a [[shield]] of some kind. With centuries of historical examples to draw upon, shields may range from large rectangular Roman-style [[Scutum (shield)|''scuta'']] to small bucklers, with common styles including the "kite", center-grip (round or oval), and "heater" (so called because it resembles the shape of a flatiron). Other popular weapon choices include two-weapons (one in each hand) or two-handed weapons such as [[greatsword]]s, [[glaive]]s, or [[katana]]. Some Kingdoms are also starting to experiment with thrown weapons such as javelins and throwing axes for use in melees and battles.

Most groups hold "fighter practices" where individual and group combat is practiced and informal instruction occurs, but in some areas there may be more formalized and structured training in a local style. Typically several years of direct experience in the SCA's Armored Combat are needed to excel in tournaments.

====Forbidden weapons====
Some weapons, while actively used within the SCA's target period, have been barred from use in SCA combat because it is difficult or impossible to make them safe. 

These include punching weapons ([[Katar (dagger)|Katar]] (कटार)), punch daggers and offensive shields such as the [[targe]], and flexible weapons such as the [[Flail (weapon)|flail]] or ball-and-chain, which can wrap around heads, limbs or shields to cause injury.

Recreations of period firearms, no matter what the type of propulsion used, are banned from use on the Armored Combat field.  This ban was put in place by the Board of Directors on January 16, 1999, on suggestion by the Society Earl Marshal at the time.  The stated reason was that the appearance of firearms signaled the downfall of chivalric combat, which the SCA attempts to recreate, and therefore having said items on the field detracts from the experience.

All of these weapons have been banned by the Society at large, and therefore cannot be used within any Kingdom across the SCA.

===Fencing or rapier combat===
[[SCA fencing]] rules differ substantially from [[Olympic Games|Olympic]] fencing rules. Instead of fencing for points, fencers attempt to 'disable' or 'kill' their opponent by striking at target areas. [[Rapier]] combatants are considered to be wearing street clothes and leather gloves, so both thrusts and cuts are accepted as attacks. SCA rules do not recognize lanes or right of way. Opponents fight "in the round". Body-to-body contact is prohibited, but hand-on-blade contact is allowed, so the off hand becomes an important factor. 

While many SCA members attempt to re-create [[rapier]] combat of the 16th and early 17th centuries, in practice it often becomes a blend of Society rules and modern fencing. Many rapier and smallsword enthusiasts study fencing manuals of the 15th and 16th centuries, and use rapier simulators made with schlaeger or bated rapier blades, rather than the more sport-oriented foil and épée blades. Some kingdoms are reviewing an experimental style called "side-sword", which allows percussive cuts and thrusts with blades suitable for cut-and-thrust style fencing.

Some fencing melees allow some firearm simulation (rubber band guns) as well. This activity is not universally accepted within the Society.

All kingdoms except the [[Kingdom of Calontir]] now have organized fencing activities.

===Combat archery===

Combat Archery allows the introduction of [[bow (weapon)|bow]]s and [[crossbow]]s to Heavy Weapons combat.  Strict rules are in place to limit the launch force of field weapons and the projectiles are specially built with large blunted tips and special backs to minimize the risk of true injury.  Consistent with other SCA combat, arrow strikes to shields are considered blocked, while strikes to armored areas of the body are not.  Judging the effects of blows is left to the honor of the combatant struck. The current Society-wide rules for Combat Archery specify that missile strikes are judged just as any blow.  That it is up to the fighter to determine if it hit them properly and with enough force.  It is stated however that strikes from arrows, by their nature, will be with less force than that with a sword.  Due to requirements of larger safety zones to protect spectators from ricochets and overshots, combat archery is usually limited to large melees. 

All archers are considered to be exactly the same as any other Heavy Combatant (though historically this hasn't always been true).  They are physically struck down to defeat them and they wear the same armor with the exception of the hands which can be more lightly armored half-gauntlets to be flexible enough to use their equipment.   Do note however that as always any combatant on the field may yield to his opponent in lieu of being hit.  Thus, many combat archers who have no other way to defend themselves will therefore yield when charged by another Heavy Combatant (instead of taking a blow from which they cannot defend themselves).

In some kingdoms, archers properly authorized, are allowed to carry melee weapons and to switch from bow/crossbow to the hand weapon. However they must properly retire their bow or crossbow before making the switch and meet safety requirements which protect any half-gauntleted hand (such as using a basket hilt).

===Other combat activities===

Thrown weapons are used in melees when permitted.  After the latest revision of the Marshal's Handbook basically any form of weapon can be made legal to be thrown.  Essentially as long as the weapon weighs under 2 pounds, has every tip padded appropriately, and meets a few other guidelines, it is legal for being thrown.  Also all thrown weapons can be used for striking or thrusting as well.

Siege Weapons are some of the most impressive pieces of machinery on the battlefield.  They are carefully designed within power guidelines to make sure that they cannot throw their ammo farther than 80 yards.&lt;ref name='siege'&gt;SCA Siege Engine Handbook - {{cite web |url=http://www.sca.org/officers/marshal/combat/siege/siege_engines_handbook.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2008-03-08 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080517163035/http://www.sca.org/officers/marshal/combat/siege/siege_engines_handbook.pdf |archivedate=2008-05-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Even at this level however there is much stored power in them and great care and training is required to use them properly and safely.

===Bardic arts===
The "bardic arts" are also popular. The [[bard]] in pre-medieval [[Celt]]ic society held a specific social class and had specific duties. In the SCA context, though, "bard" refers to most storytellers, poets, and musicians. 

SCA bards not only perform historical period pieces but often compose new period-style works, some of which are based on SCA culture. These may be in the style of ancient forms, such as a new version of a [[Child Ballad]], or a piece recounting (in period style) some aspect of the "Current Middle Ages" such as a history of an SCA kingdom, a tribute to an individual, or an account of an event. 

One crossover from [[science fiction fandom]] found in the SCA is "filking." A [[filk]] is a new lyric set to an existing melody. This practice has ample historical antecedent; ancient musical codices are full of [[Trope (music)|tropes]] that set new lyrics to existing tunes. For example, The Codex [[Carmina Burana]] is a collection of often-ribald lyrics set to the [[Gregorian chant]] tunes that were used in worship at the time. What sets filks apart is that the tunes are generally modern: Broadway show tunes, top-40 radio hits (going back to the 1960s when the SCA got its start), and so on. Filk has been used to teach novice members something about the organization's history (e.g., 'Imperium Compound,' versions of which were unique to each early kingdom and chronicled the reigns of the kings by the supposed foibles of each). SCA filksongs have also been used to protest Society policies or customs, with some success; for example, the famous 'Berzark Rag' protesting the use of excessive striking force advocated by the Society's Earl Marshal in the late 1960s resulted in his removal from office; and the strains of 'Causes of Rebellion' (aka 'Lie to the Council') by Astra of the Grey Shadows have stirred many a political tempest in their day. 

Sometimes, awards are given for prowess in the Bardic Arts; though not as developed or common as the martial arts awards, bards prize this recognition by their peers. Kingdoms and principalities may have a College of Bards. These may be highly structured or very loosely organized. 

Many [[early music]] performers resist being categorized only as a "bard," because they may have specific cultural interests and prefer to style themselves as [[minstrel]]s, [[troubadour]]s, [[trouvère]]s, [[minnesinger]]s, [[skald]]s, etc. 

A common bardic activity is the "bardic circle," where performers take turns sharing pieces. Circles may be structured, with participants passing a token to indicate who has the floor, or they may be informal, with performers following each other in no set order. Some circles may have a theme. Feasts are another common venue for musicians to perform individually or in groups (i.e. consorts and plays). 

During camping events at night, bards may practice "firewalking" (also known as fyrewalking or fire-crawling), where a performer or small group travel from campsite to campsite offering entertainment or joining other bardic circles in progress. Generally, it is considered polite to welcome a new bard who enters an encampment to perform (harkening back to the days when traveling bards were mostly the only entertainment or news to be had). Besides the applause, bards may be offered drink, food or other refreshments for their performances.

===Equestrian activities===

The Equestrian Guilds promote the study, practice, demonstration, and teaching of [[equestrianism|equestrian]]-related activities in the Knowne World. The EQ Guilds encourage participation in games that are modeled on training techniques used by medieval armies, as well as a version of [[jousting]]. 

At an equestrian event one may see riders competing in such games as: 
* Rings, where the rider uses a lance to collect variously-sized rings from tall stands placed in a row;
* Heads, where the rider must weave through a line of poles that have "heads" placed atop, while attempting to knock the heads off with a padded (or "boffer") sword;
* Reeds, where the rider must ride in a straight line between poles that have reeds set atop them, while attempting to knock the reeds off the poles with a padded sword;
* The Quintain, where the rider uses a lance to strike a shield-shaped target mounted on a pole (to simulate striking an opponent in the Joust);
* Pig Sticking, where a rider attempts to put a spear into a target on the ground (not a real pig);
* Mounted Archery, where the rider must control his/her mount while shooting arrows at a target;
* Mounted Crest Combat, where two opponents, wearing steel helmets, "attack" each other with boffer swords, attempting to knock the crest off the other's helmet;
* Jousting. (Note, SCA Equestrian rules prohibit full-contact jousting at this time. Lances are constructed with breakaway foam tips, and riders must be able to easily release the lance if enough force is made upon contact with their opponent.)

Some of these games are designed to teach the rider to control his/her mount and weapon while in a combat situation. Others simulate hunting from horseback. Riders who wish to participate must demonstrate their ability to control a horse at various [[horse gait|gaits]], and control a [[horse]] while holding a weapon. Riders start at the Beginner level riding at a walk, and then advance through intermediate (trot) and advanced (canter or gallop) when they have proven their abilities to the Equestrian marshallate.

===Heraldry===
The SCA maintains its own College of Arms to register and protect [[heraldry|heraldic devices]] of its members (at least within the Society). 

For the first three decades of the Society's existence, all heraldic device submissions had to be checked against extant SCA arms, heraldry taken from or alluding to works of fiction, and coats of arms granted to families alive or extinct. Following a major revision of the SCA's rules for heraldic submissions, SCA armorial bearings are now checked for conflict only against major coats of arms, devices and symbols that exist in the real world, and arms awarded within the Society itself. 

Thus, while a person cannot register the [[Coat of Arms]] of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Queen Elizabeth II]] or of [[France]], for example, the SCA's College of Arms no longer checks for device conflicts with arms registered with the several European colleges of arms. In practical terms, the Modest Proposal rendered the Society as autonomous in matters of heraldry as the Colleges of Arms of various nations are in reality.

The Society's College of Arms also registers and maintains SCA names, checking against duplication and ensuring at least minimal period authenticity. In some cases, names that were once acceptable (for example, Fiona) have been shown to be of modern origin and are no longer allowed. Though bearers whose names were approved before such research are not required to change them, no new submissions with names the heralds have documented as having come into use outside the SCA's period will be accepted.

While there is no requirement to register a name and/or device, members are encouraged to do so. Newcomers are often counseled by experienced members on choosing a suitable persona name, and local heralds are usually enthusiastic about helping new members create and register a unique device that represents their personality and interests.

===Cooking===
Many SCA events feature food ranging from simple "fighter's fare" or a "peasant lunch" of bread, cheese, hard-boiled eggs, and a simple vegetable or meat soup, to elaborate multi-course feasts served over a period of several hours. Such feasts may focus on dishes from England, France, Italy, Germany, Spain, or other locations and times within the SCA's period of study. Common dishes are roasted beef or chickens with mustard or other sauces on the side, meat pies, cheese-filled ravioli, green salads, "armored turnips" (turnips sliced and layered with cheese and spices), glazed carrots, applesauce, and pears or apples cooked in wine. 

Feasts are not always limited to strictly period foods and recipes, but they rarely include glaringly non-period items such as hamburgers or corndogs (though there was at least one group which put on a feast in which they documented 'beans and weenies'). As with period feasts, there is often an elaborate main dish or dessert called a [[Entremet|subtlety]]. (One group has a running gag at their annual feast in which the main dish is a mythical beast. To make a "sea dragon", for example, they assembled a {{convert|5|ft|m|adj=mid|-long}} meatloaf with a dozen chicken drumsticks arrayed along each side.) 

Cooks who strive to stick to period recipes for their dishes make an effort to ensure that their menus are balanced to allow for modern palates, ingredients, and equipment, or to compensate for tight budgets or labor shortages.

A running joke in the SCA (and at least one song in very deliberate ''bad taste'') concerns the supposed inedibility of feast food. On the contrary, SCA feasts are typically prepared by talented and capable volunteers who work long hours to prepare a good and filling meal&amp;mdash;and usually at a cost of only a few dollars per person. Sometimes these amateur efforts even equal or surpass the quality of many expensive restaurants.

Those who work to prepare feasts are highly regarded, customarily being called into the dining area at the conclusion of the feast and thanked with thunderous applause, and many kingdoms provide for awards and titles to be granted to those who excel in this field {{citation needed|date=May 2014}}.

===Calligraphy and illumination===
[[Western calligraphy|Calligraphy]] is the art of writing beautifully, while illumination is the artwork decorating the page, usually with paint and gold leaf. Together these arts are used to create [[illuminated manuscripts]], commonly called "scrolls" within the SCA. In many kingdoms, the awards that the royalty give in court are accompanied by an illuminated scroll made by a volunteer. Scrolls are also sometimes made to commemorate winning a tournament or competition, or an agreement between two parties within the context of the SCA. Despite the fact that period documents of this sort usually contained little illumination, scrolls are commonly modeled after the pages in [[Book of hours|Books of Hours]], Bibles or other medieval and Renaissance manuscripts, including elaborately painted borders around the text. Scribes use a variety of materials to produce these works. As with other arts, the authenticity of the materials used varies from scribe to scribe: paper, parchment or [[Vellum|vellum]] for the writing surface; watercolor, [[Gouache|gouache]], acrylic or dry pigments mixed with a binder like [[gum Arabic]], tempera (egg yolk) or glair (egg white) for paint; fountain pens, dip pens or quills for writing. Over the Society's history, the arts of calligraphy and illumination have advanced substantially, so that many scribes now use completely authentic materials and tools.

Scribes often attempt to match the period and style of a scroll to the persona of the recipient. While most scrolls are done on paper or vellum, this has occasionally led to SCA scribes creating works on objects ranging from stone tablets to drinking horns. This kind of creativity is generally encouraged, as long as the resulting object maintains a reasonable level of authenticity.

Most SCA kingdoms have an officer whose responsibility it is to train and nurture scribes and, if the kingdom gives scrolls with its awards, coordinate the production of those scrolls. That officer's title often includes the word "Signet" from the word for a seal used to sign documents in period.

===Dance===
Dance practices are held where [[Renaissance Dance]] and [[English Country Dance]] are taught in preparation for events and demos. There are also subsets within the SCA that practice and teach Middle Eastern (Egyptian Cabaret, Folkloric and American Tribal Style bellydance) and South Asian (Bharatanatyam, Kathak, Kuchipudi) styles of dance to be performed at events and around campfires.

===Fiber arts===
Many members, including men, enjoy practicing the arts of [[needlepoint]], [[embroidery]], [[cross-stitch]], [[weaving]], [[lace-making]], [[quilting]], [[kumihimo]], [[spinning (textiles)|spinning]], [[nalbinding]], [[sprang]], [[braiding]] and [[dyeing]]. Period techniques are employed when possible, yielding intricately detailed and useful artwork which beautifies clothing and objects. Embroidery and cross-stitch in particular are often employed to create favors,&lt;ref&gt;Favors - http://www.florilegium.org/files/ACCESS/On-Favors-art.html&lt;/ref&gt; given as gifts, tokens of affection or awards and often bear the [[coat of arms|arms]] or device of the person (usually a lady) giving the favor, or the arms of the SCA Order which the award is being bestowed (Pelican, Laurel, etc.).

===Chirurgeonate===
With all the varied activities that go on and all of the people that attend events...accidents are bound to happen.  The Chirurgeonate are a group of SCA members who volunteer to provide first aid at the various events.  As it says in the "Official Chirurgeon's Handbook": "The members of the Chirurgeonate include Red Cross or ASHI-trained first aiders, medical doctors, military medical corpsmen, nurses, paramedics, St. John’s and St. Andrew’s ambulance volunteers, and many other medical volunteers and professionals.  We come from all walks of life and from many countries around the globe.  We are united as members of the Chirurgeonate for one purpose:  to provide first aid at SCA events." [Chirurgeon's Handbook, 2007, 1.1]&lt;ref&gt;Chirurgeon's Handbook- {{cite web |url=http://www.sca.org/officers/chirurgeon/pdf/ChirurgeonsHandbook2007.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-06-14 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100615074548/http://sca.org/officers/chirurgeon/pdf/ChirurgeonsHandbook2007.pdf |archivedate=2010-06-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==SCA events==
Events, which occur on rented sites, vary enormously, offering a wide variety of activities and are attended by garbed participants.  SCA events are not typically spectator-oriented, so attendees are expected to follow SCA norms, including an attempt to dress in pre-17th century garb (clothing). This is one of the primary differences between SCA events and [[Renaissance Fair]]s.

Most events will normally finish with a Court to allow for the awarding of honors, and (in some areas) a feast. Evening activities can include bardic circles (formal and informal), medieval dancing, and post-revels (a party usually held at an individual's home).

[[Image:Cal-2004-007.jpg|frame|A family attending an SCA event]]

===Combat events and wars===
Combat events involve either tournaments with one-on-one SCA armored combat, or wars where teams compete against each other. Events focused on combat often have other activities happening at the same time.

Where a typical event may host anywhere from 20-800 participants over a weekend, the largest wars typically draw thousands from across the Society for up to two weeks. The longest and largest of these events is the [[Pennsic War]]—a two-week event in August catering to over 11,000 people participating in everything from combat to dance to history lessons. Combat at a war can involve forces numbering 100 to 3,000 participants on each side and can include safe versions of archery and [[siege engine]]s. The largest event in Australia is the [[Kingdom of Lochac#Rowany Festival|Rowany Festival]].

Several combat-related activities happen independently at an event. Armored combat (swords, axes, etc.), fencing, and target archery may happen simultaneously on separate fields.

===Arts and sciences===
The SCA promotes the crafts, skills, and technologies practiced in the time period and cultures that the SCA covers. Arts and sciences range from the recipes used for a feast to the armor used in combat, the clothes and costumes that are worn to the bardic arts of singing, storytelling, poetry and instrumental pieces. An officer in the local group called the Minister of Arts and Sciences is usually in charge of promoting these crafts and aiding members in finding appropriate information.
Other events are set up as a learning experience for the members. Typically, classes are given in history or crafts of the period, or in how to better perform activities within the SCA. Topics can range from [[heraldry]], [[philosophy]], and [[history]] to costuming, [[calligraphy]], and [[metalwork]]. Some "A&amp;S" events have competitions, with the largest offering overall prizes or championships in the arts.

===Coronations and investitures===
These events center on the changing of the ceremonial leadership of sub-groups from the local barony up to the kingdoms. These events typically are more focused on ceremonial affairs, concentrating more on meetings and organization than combat or arts and sciences. As such, they are also more centered on the SCA's internal culture than on historical matters.

===Demonstrations===
Demonstrations or ''demos'' are intended for audiences and are put on by volunteers for a variety of purposes. Schools and community groups may request or be offered demos for education or entertainment. The SCA provides demonstrations of medieval arts and sciences, and members often teach beginner classes on the crafts and activities that can be learned. Combat demonstrations are usually of SCA-style combat using rattan weapons, although rapier combat is also demonstrated.

The Society has attempted, somewhat successfully, to become a more family-friendly environment since its founding. Demos provide an opportunity for interested people to get more information about participation in their local branch of the SCA.

===Practices===
As interest levels allow, SCA groups hold regular practices for a variety of activities. These tend to be unofficial and informal affairs where pre-17th century costume, while always welcome, is not required. Some practices are ostensibly for one activity but attract people interested not necessarily in the activity itself but more in socializing. A dance practice, for example, may draw the entire chapter together to 'hang out', while a small percentage actually dance. This serves to help integrate the group and prevent segmentation.  These practices range from a variety of things from the various martial activities to the various arts and sciences. These practices serve a multitude of purposes. Often the most common practices in a group revolve around the arts and combat, and are organized by a group interested in a certain SCA activity under the auspices of a "guild." Common guilds include those for archery, brewing, cooking, dance, equestrian, fiber arts, period music, scribal arts, and smithing. In almost every group there is an associated officer that hosts these practices and serves as primarily a liaison between those willing to participate and those willing to teach.  These practices are not exclusively held by an overseeing group; sometimes masters of their trade will hold regular practices to take on new students and to continue the education of old ones.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1538">The '''Sordones''' were an ancient (Pre-[[Ancient Rome|Roman]]) people of the [[Iberian peninsula]] (the Roman [[Hispania]]). They are believed to be of [[Iberian language]]. Their territory was located in the [[Roussillon]], in what is now the [[France|French]] département of [[Pyrénées-Orientales]] and was limited in the west by the [[Pyrenees]]. They are classified as ancient [[Iberians|Iberian]] or as ancient [[Gaul]]s according to the sources.&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Nicolas Bouillet &amp; Alexis Chassang (dir.), « Sardones » in the ''Dictionnaire universel d’histoire et de géographie'', 1878&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.mac.cat/cat/Rutes/Ruta-dels-Ibers Museu d'arqueologia de Catalunya - La ruta dels ibers]&lt;/ref&gt;

The main towns of the Sordones were [[Ruscino]], present-day [[Château-Roussillon]] near [[Perpignan]], and Illiberis, present day [[Elne]].

''For the a form-fitting garment which covers the whole body see:[[Jumpsuit]] or [[Onesie (jumpsuit)|Onesie]]'' 

[[File:Selburose-sweater.jpg|thumb|280px|One from the Graham Leggate collection, Norwegian Selbu rose design]]

A '''jumper''' or jersey ([[British English]]), or '''sweater''' ([[American English]]) is a garment intended to cover the torso and arms.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oxforddictionaries.com/definition/sweater sweater: definition of sweater in Oxford dictionary (British &amp; World English),&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; A jumper is either a '''pullover''' or a [[cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]], distinguished in that cardigans open at the front while pullovers do not. Some British dictionaries include cardigans as a type of jumper,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://en.oxforddictionaries.com/definition/cardigan |title=definition of cardigan in British &amp; World English |quote=A knitted '''jumper''' fastening down the front. |work=[[OxfordDictionaries.com]] |publisher=Oxford University Press |accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while others do not;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dictionary.cambridge.org/dictionary/english/jumper?a=british |title=jumper |quote=a piece of clothing with long sleeves that is usually made from wool, is worn on the upper part of the body '''and does not open at the front'''. |work=Cambridge English Dictionary |publisher=[[Cambridge University Press]] |accessdate=26 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; in the latter case, there is no [[hypernym]] equivalent to ''sweater'' covering both pullovers and cardigans.

Sweaters are worn by adults and children of all genders; often over a [[shirt]], [[blouse]], [[T-shirt]], or other top, but sometimes next to the skin. Sweaters were traditionally made from [[wool]], but can now be made of [[cotton]], [[synthetic fiber]]s, or any combination thereof. Sweaters are maintained by washing or dry cleaning, and the use of a [[lint roller]] or [[Pill (textile)|pill]] razor.

==Types and design==
[[File:Hot dog sweater 1434172037.jpg|thumb| left|"Hot dog" Sweater]]
The term "sweater" is a catch-all for a variety of knit garments. Although the term often refers to a pullover, it can also refer to a [[cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]], a garment that opens and fastens down the front. Within either group, there is a great variety of design. Various [[neckline]]s are found, although the V-neck, turtleneck and the crew neck are the most popular.  The hemline is typically at hip height or slightly longer, just overlapping the waist of one's pants or skirt, but can vary significantly. It can range from just below the bust in women's garments to mid-thigh in either sex, or even longer in a knitted variation of the [[poncho]] [[shirtdress]]. The [[sleeve]] length is also variable, ranging from full-length or three-quarters to short-sleeved, cap sleeves or sleeveless. The front [[style line|seam]] or opening of a cardigan allows for further different styles, such as a [[surplice]] or a [[bolero jacket]].  All hems may have various types of borders, such as [[picot]]s, [[ribbing (knitting)|ribbing]] and frills.

[[basic knitted fabrics|Knitted fabrics]] are generally somewhat [[elasticity (physics)|elastic]] and have a softer hand (feel or drape) than woven fabric, sweaters that are more tightly fitted or have a soft drape may conform well to the body without requiring [[tailoring]] necessary in a woven garment such as darts, flares and gores. Even when such shaping is used, it can be knit into the fabric itself, without requiring seams.

Another type is a [[sweater vest]].

==Nomenclature==
[[File:1940 Trachtenstrickjacke anagoria.JPG|thumb|A cardigan]]
[[File:Islandpullover 004.jpg|thumb|A pullover from Iceland]]
[[File:Jumper altered PsCSJPG10.jpg|thumb|A jumper]]
A sweater with an open front fastened by [[button]]s or a [[zipper]] is generally called a '''[[Cardigan (sweater)|cardigan]]''', but the nomenclature for other styles in different [[List of dialects of the English language|dialects]] can be quite confusing. In [[British English]], a sweater may also be called a pullover, jumper or jersey. In the United States however, "[[Jumper (dress)|jumper]]" refers to a style of women's sleeveless dress, worn over a blouse or shirt, and "jersey" refers to a knit shirt, especially if part of an athletic uniform. If sleeveless, such a garment may be called a "slipover" or "tank top" in British English, while "tank top" in [[US English]] refers to a [[sleeveless shirt|sleeveless shirt or undershirt]]. In the U.S. a sleeveless sweater may also be called a [[sweater vest]], especially if it has a V-neck and somewhat formal appearance resembling a formal vest, a garment known as a [[waistcoat]] in the UK In British English, "vest" refers to an undershirt. In [[South African English]], a knitted sweater is always called a '''jersey''', while ''sweater'', when used, refers to a ''sweatshirt''. In the sport of [[ice hockey]], the top of a hockey player's uniform had traditionally been a sweater; and even though modern hockey uniform tops are more commonly a [[jersey (clothing)|jersey]] they are typically referred to as a "hockey sweater," regardless of the style, but frequently, in the U.S. it is called a hockey "jersey".

==Customary wear==
[[File:Seaman jumper.JPG|thumb|right|Seaman's jumper, woolen, hand-knitted.]]
Thin sweaters may be worn tucked into the waistband of [[trousers]]; but otherwise, men's sweaters are worn untucked. Nonetheless, some individuals, including some television and film actors, have been known for wearing tucked-in sweaters.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.gq.com/style/style-guy/coats-and-sweaters/200501/tucking-in-models-ralph-lauren|title=Tucking in sweaters|date=January 14, 2005|work=GQ.COM}}&lt;!--Notable individuals seen wearing their sweaters tucked include [[Cary Grant]], [[Gary Cooper]], [[Russ Salzberg]], [[Sylvester McCoy]], and [[Hadley Eliker]].  The most widely known is [[Bill Cosby]], for whom the [[neologism]] ''Cosby sweater'' was coined. &lt;see previous cite for link&gt; --&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

Sweaters are a versatile item of clothing and can be worn on top of almost any outfit. Sports sweaters are often worn on tops of sports kit while traveling to or from a sports ground. Sweaters can be worn with a [[dress shirt]] underneath (and optionally a [[Necktie|tie]]), which has the advantage of allowing the wearer to have the option of removing the sweater when it is uncomfortably warm and still looking presentable in many situations. Layering and the ease with which it allows for temperature regulation is a major benefit of the sweater as an article of clothing. Various methods have evolved for conveniently carrying a sweater, once removed.  The three most common approaches are: around the waist (either loin cloth or knotted in front style) and over the shoulder.

In the late 20th century, the sweater increasingly came to be worn as an alternative to a shirt when finer materials made them more comfortable next to the skin.

Some people enjoy wearing Christmas-related sweaters around Christmas time to get into the festive spirit. 
Some women's sweaters are meant to be worn belted; a belt or drawstring is sometimes knitted into the sweater itself. Leggings are commonly worn with long sweaters or sweater dresses.

==Ice hockey==
The [[Hockey jersey|uniforms]] that present day [[ice hockey]] players wear are sometimes referred to as "sweaters", although they nowadays usually more closely resemble the jerseys worn in other sports like [[association football|soccer]]. This is because original uniforms were simply sweaters with the team's logo stitched on the front. However, as technology changed, so did the uniforms as actual sweaters absorbed too much moisture and became weighed down and cumbersome throughout the course of a game.

==Sweatshirts==
{{anchor|Sweatshirt}}
{{Redirect|Sweatshirt|the song by [[Jacob Sartorius]]|Sweatshirt (song)}}

In 1926 [[Benjamin C. Russell| Benjamin Russell Jr.]], a quarterback for the [[Alabama Crimson Tide Football]] team, was tired of the constant chafing and itching caused by their wool football uniforms.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.gq.com/story/dropping-knowledge-the-crewneck-sweatshirt|title=Dropping Knowledge: The Crewneck Sweatshirt|last=Gallagher|first=Jake|date=2013-08-28|work=GQ|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Russell Jr. worked with his father, who owned a manufacturing company, to come up with a better option. At the time, [[Russell Athletic| Russell Manufacturing Company]] made garments for women's and children's knit shirts and undergarments.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.russellathletic.com/history|title=Sites-russell_us-Site|website=Russell US|language=default|access-date=2017-09-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Knowing the durability and comfort of cotton they created a new practice jersey that was a modification of a ladies’ [[union suit]] top from thick cotton&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://blog.queensboro.com/2015/02/11/a-brief-exploration-of-the-evolution-of-the-hoodie/|title=A Brief Exploration of the Evolution of the Hoodie|date=2015-02-11|work=Queensboro: Behind the Seams|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; that was produced throughout the factory. These loose, collarless pullovers – produced from women’s undergarments to be used as men’s football jerseys - would go on to become an iconic sweatshirt. Russell went on to create a new division of his factory, focusing solely on the production of sweatshirts in the Russell Athletic mills in 1930. Eventually, Russell Athletic mills became [[Russell Athletic (brand)|Russell Athletic]] co. 

The sweatshirt's potential as a portable advertising tool was discovered in the 1960s when U.S. universities began printing their names on the medium. For students and parents alike, university names on sweatshirts became the preferred casual attire for exhibiting school pride. The sweatshirt, along with the [[T-shirt]], provided a cheap and effective way of disseminating information on a mass scale. The T-shirt slogan fad of the seventies inevitably translated to sweatshirts. Recognizing the relative simplicity of customization and the power of clever graphics combined with catchphrases, sweatshirts became a vehicle for personal expression for both the designer and the person wearing them.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://fashion-history.lovetoknow.com/clothing-types-styles/sweatshirt|title=Sweatshirt|work=LoveToKnow|access-date=2017-09-19|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Sweatshirts are arguably a type of sweater, but made of a fabric and cut similar to [[sweatpants]]. A sweatshirt worn with sweatpants forms a sweatsuit a kind of exercise clothing designed to raise the core body temperature and cause [[perspiration]] in order to lose body weight before a weigh in for a weight divided sport. It is fashioned out of a thick, usually cotton jersey material.{{cn|date=July 2015}} Sweatshirts are also almost exclusively casual attire and not dressy as some other sweaters may be. Sweatshirts may or may not have a hood, and may or may not have a zipper. A sweatshirt with a hood is now usually referred to as a [[hoodie]], although more formal media still use the term "hooded sweatshirt".

'''Tadhg Óg Ó Cianáin''' (IPA:/{{IPA|taɪɡ ɔːɡ oʊ 'kɪə·nan}}/)&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Outside of [[Ulster]], Og (son) is pronounced /o:g/&lt;/ref&gt; (died ''[[circa|c.]]'' 1614) was an Irish writer.

He was the author of ''Turas na dTaoiseach/the Departure of the Lords'', a [[diary]] of the [[Flight of the Earls]], kept from September 1607 to November 1608, from Rathmullen, [[County Donegal]] to Rome. It is the earliest example in Irish of the diary genre. 

==Origins==

[[Ó Cianáin]] was a member of a professional Irish learned family who were originally [[erenagh]]s of the parish of Cleenish, [[Lough Erne]], but who had served for several centuries as historians to [[Maguire (surname)|Mag Uidir]] of [[Fermanagh|Fear Manach]] (2007, p.&amp;nbsp;437).

One of the family's most noted productions was [[Leabhar Adhamh Ó Cianáin]], written in or about the 1340s by [[Adhamh Ó Cianáin]] (died 1373) by and for himself, and out of the book of his teacher, [[Seán Mór Ó Dubhagáin]] (died 1372). The [[Annals of the Four Masters]] cite the deaths of members of the family under the years 1387, 1400, 1405, 1459, 1569, 1483.

Tadhg had at least one sibling, [[Cu Chonnacht Ó Cianáin]], (died 1615), a rymer or chronicler to Rory Maguire.

==In the service of Ó Néill==

Ó Cianáin appears to have entered the service of Ó Néill during the course of the [[Nine Years' War (Ireland)|Nine Years' War]]; he was one of seven of the surname located in the townland of Portnelligan, Tynan parish, south-west of [[Armagh]] pardoned on 6 December 1602 (2007, p.&amp;nbsp;20).

Ó Muraíle relates Ó Fiaich's suggestion that ''"[[Hugh Ó Neill, 2nd Earl of Tyrone|Hugh O Neill]] had granted them land in Co. Armagh, since it was not the Ó Cianáins' native country. Against that, however, there is a townland called Drumadd, north of Portnelligan and close to Armagh city, whose Irish name is Dromad Uí Cianáin. In addition, it may be noted that one of Co. Armagh's principal surnames in 1659 was O Keenan."'' (2007, p.&amp;nbsp;21).

==Turas na dTaoiseach==

Brady and Cleave made the following assessment:

{{quote|
"Tadhg kept a detailed account of the flight from [[Ulster]] and the journey to Rome, not on a high level of political reason and plans, but a plain man's view of what actually happened each day, what they ate and did, how they felt, what the various towns they passed through were like, culminating with their arrival in Rome and the subsequent arrival there of the [[king of France]]."
}}

The miraculous survival of Tadhg's unique manuscript-copy (MS A 21 Ó Cléirigh collection, [[University College Dublin]]). Tadhg in his immediate pre-flight year a resident of Portnelligan, [[Tynan]], [[County Armagh]], listed with six other Ó Cianáins as among the follower of Henry Óg Ó Neill in a pardon list 'fiant' of December 1602 (Cú Chonnacht, Seaán mac Conchobhair, Pádraig Óg, Uaithne, Seaán mac Pádraig Mhóir). Tadhg's property—fifteen cows, eight calves, one garron, one hackeny, twenty-five swine, all valued at £22.6s.3d—were forfeited but later returned to his wife at the intervention of the [[Earl of Thomond]], who was a relative of hers.

Tadhg died in Rome, apparently late in 1614. He was a brother to [[Cu Chonnacht Ó Cianáin]].

==Relatives in Ireland==

In the aftermath of the departure, Ó Cianáin's property, valued at £22 6 shillings 2 pence, was seized, but later returned to his wife at the behest of [[Donogh O'Brien, 4th Earl of Thomond]]. Thomond claimed to be a relative of Ó Cianáin's wife, possibly via the mysterious Donnchadh mac Mathgamhain Ó Briain who travelled with [[Rory Ó Donnell, 1st Earl of Tyrconnell]]. No further information is available on his children, if he had any.

His brother, [[Cu Chonnacht Ó Cianáin]], was tortured on the rack and hanged in [[Derry]] in July 1615.

==Other works==

On 28 March 1627, while collecting materials for what would become the ''[[Annals of the Four Masters]],'' [[Mícheál Ó Cléirigh]] made use of some [[hagiographical]] material written by him, since lost. (Walsh, 1996). Ó Muraíle (2007, p.&amp;nbsp;22) identifies this text as ''Ionnarba Mochuda a Rathain'' (''The Banishment of St Mochuda from Rahan'')—see [[Mo Chutu of Lismore]]. The original manuscript does not appear to have survived.

==About==

As part of the now-defunct Tulsa Center for the Study of Women's Literature, the journal was founded in 1982 by Germaine Greer while she was teaching at the [[University of Tulsa]]. Greer's purpose for the journal was to begin "the rehabilitation of women's literary history".&lt;ref name="greer quotation"&gt;''Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature'' 1.1 (1982): 23&lt;/ref&gt;  Following her tenure, Shari Benstock (1983–1986), Mary O’Toole (1986–1988), Holly Laird (1988–2005), and Laura Stevens (2005-2016) each served as the journal’s editor. Jennifer Airey became the editor in 2016.

The distinctive TSWL logo, present from the journal's inaugural issue, is a [[saxifrage|saxifrage flower]], captioned with a quotation from William Turner’s ''Herbal'': "The white saxifrage with the indented leafe is moste commended for the breakinge of the stone."&lt;ref name="turner quotation"&gt;''Herbal'' 3 (1568): 68&lt;/ref&gt;

The journal's editorial and advisory boards include scholars prominent in their fields. Board members include [[Nina auerbach|Nina Auerbach]], [[Marilyn Butler]], [[Carol T. Christ]], [[Helen Cooper (professor)|Helen Cooper]], [[Sandra Gilbert|Sandra M. Gilbert]], [[Susan Gubar]], [[Peggy Kamuf]], and [[Jane Marcus]].&lt;ref name="boards"&gt;[http://www.utulsa.edu/tswl/advisory_and_editorial_boards.htm 5]''Tulsa Studies in Women's Literature'' Advisory and Editorial Boards&lt;/ref&gt;

'''World-systems theory''' (also known as '''world-systems analysis''' or '''the world-systems perspective''')&lt;ref name=IW&gt;Immanuel Wallerstein, (2004), "World-systems Analysis." In ''World System History'', ed. George Modelski, in ''Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems'' (EOLSS), Developed under the Auspices of the UNESCO, Eolss Publishers, Oxford, UK&lt;/ref&gt; is a multidisciplinary, macro-scale approach to [[world history]] and [[social change]] which emphasizes the [[world-system]] (and not [[nation state]]s) as the primary (but not exclusive) unit of [[social analysis]].&lt;ref name=IW/&gt;&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;

"World-system" refers to the inter-regional and transnational [[division of labor]], which divides the world into [[core countries]], [[semi-periphery countries]], and the [[periphery countries]].&lt;ref name=TB&gt;Thomas Barfield, ''The dictionary of anthropology'', Wiley-Blackwell, 1997, {{ISBN|1-57718-057-7}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=V5dkKYyHclwC&amp;pg=PA498&amp;dq=#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Google Print, p.498-499]&lt;/ref&gt; Core countries focus on higher skill, [[Capital (economics)|capital]]-intensive production, and the rest of the world focuses on low-skill, labor-intensive production and extraction of [[raw material]]s.&lt;ref name=glob/&gt; This constantly reinforces the dominance of the core countries.&lt;ref name=glob/&gt; Nonetheless, the system has dynamic characteristics, in part as a result of revolutions in [[transport]] technology, and individual states can gain or lose their core (semi-periphery, periphery) status over time.&lt;ref name=glob/&gt; This structure is unified by the division of labour. It is a world-economy rooted in a capitalist economy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=World-systems analysis: An introduction|last=Wallerstein|first=Immanuel Maurice|publisher=Duke University Press|year=2004|isbn=|location=|pages=23–24|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For a time, certain countries become the world [[hegemon]]; during the last few centuries, as the world-system has extended geographically and intensified economically, this status has passed from the [[Netherlands]], to the [[United Kingdom]] and (most recently) to the [[United States]].&lt;ref name=glob/&gt;

==Background==

[[Immanuel Wallerstein]] has developed the best-known version of world-systems analysis, beginning in the 1970s.&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel (1974). The Modern World-System I: Capitalist Agriculture and the Origins of the European World-Economy in the Sixteenth Century. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PH&gt;Paul Halsall [http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/mod/wallerstein.html Modern History Sourcebook: Summary of Wallerstein on World System Theory], August 1997&lt;/ref&gt; Wallerstein traces the rise of the [[capitalism|capitalist]] world-economy from the "long" 16th century (c. 1450–1640). The rise of capitalism, in his view, was an accidental outcome of the protracted crisis of feudalism (c. 1290–1450).&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel (1992). "The West, Capitalism, and the Modern World-System", Review 15 (4), 561-619; also Wallerstein, The Modern World-System I, chapter one; Moore, Jason W. (2003) "[http://www.jasonwmoore.com/uploads/Moore__The_Modern_World-System_as_Environmental_History__Theory___Society__2003_.pdf The Modern World-System as Environmental History?] Ecology and the rise of Capitalism," Theory &amp; Society 32(3), 307–377.&lt;/ref&gt; Europe ([[Western world|the West]]) used its advantages and gained control over most of the world economy and presided over the development and spread of [[industrialization]] and capitalist economy, indirectly resulting in [[international inequality|unequal development]].&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=glob/&gt;&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;

Though other commentators refer to Wallerstein's project as world-systems "theory", he consistently rejects that term.&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel. 2004. ''The Uncertainties of Knowledge''. Philadelphia: Temple University Press.&lt;/ref&gt; For Wallerstein, world-systems analysis is a mode of analysis that aims to transcend the structures of knowledge inherited from the 19th century, especially the definition of capitalism, the divisions within the social sciences, and those between the social sciences and history.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Social Change and Development: Modernization, Dependency, and World-Systems Theory|last=So|first=Alvin Y.|publisher=Sage Publications|year=1990|isbn=|location=Newbury Park, London and New Delhi|pages=169–199|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Wallerstein, then, world-systems analysis is a "knowledge movement"&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel. 2004. 2004a. "World-Systems Analysis." In ''World System History: Encyclopedia of Life Support Systems'', edited by George Modelski. Oxford: UNESCO/EOLSS Publishers, http://www.eolss.net.&lt;/ref&gt; that seeks to discern the "totality of what has been paraded under the labels of the... human sciences and indeed well beyond".&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, ''The Uncertainties of Knowledge'', p. 62.&lt;/ref&gt; "We must invent a new language," Wallerstein insists, to transcend the illusions of the "three supposedly distinctive arenas" of society, economy and politics.&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel. 1991. "Beyond Annales," ''Radical History Review'', no. 49, p. 14.&lt;/ref&gt; The trinitarian structure of knowledge is grounded in another, even grander, modernist architecture, the distinction of biophysical worlds (including those within bodies) from social ones: "One question, therefore, is whether we will be able to justify something called social science in the twenty-first century as a separate sphere of knowledge."&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel. 1995. "What Are We Bounding, and Whom, When We Bound Social Research?" ''Social Research'' 62(4):839–856.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Moore, Jason W. 2011. 2011.

==Origins==

===Influences and major thinkers===
World-systems theory traces emerged in the 1970s.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; Its roots can be found in [[sociology]], but it has developed into a highly interdisciplinary field.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
World-systems theory was aiming to replace [[modernization theory]], which Wallerstein criticised for three reasons:&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
# its focus on the [[nation state]] as the only [[unit of analysis]]
# its assumption that there is only [[sociocultural evolution|a single path of evolutionary development for all countries]]
# its disregard of transnational structures that constrain local and national development.

There are three major predecessors of world-systems theory: the Annales school, the Marxist tradition, and the dependence theory.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=CAMV&gt;Carlos A. Martínez-Vela, [http://web.mit.edu/esd.83/www/notebook/WorldSystem.pdf World Systems Theory], paper prepared for the [http://web.mit.edu/esd.83/www/notebook/NewNotebook.htm Research Seminar in Engineering Systems], November 2003&lt;/ref&gt; The '''[[Annales School]]''' tradition (represented most notably by [[Fernand Braudel]]) influenced Wallerstein to focusing on [[longue durée|long-term processes]] and geo-ecological regions as [[unit of analysis]]. '''[[Marxism]]''' added a stress on [[social conflict]], a focus on the [[capital accumulation]] process and competitive [[class struggle]]s, a focus on a relevant totality, the transitory nature of social forms and a [[dialectic]]al sense of motion through conflict and contradiction.

World-systems theory was also significantly influenced by '''[[dependency theory]]''', a [[neo-Marxist]] explanation of development processes.

Other influences on the world-systems theory come from scholars such as [[Karl Polanyi]], [[Nikolai Kondratiev]]&lt;ref&gt;Kondratieff Waves in the World System Perspective. ''[http://cliodynamics.ru/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=336&amp;Itemid=1 Kondratieff Waves. Dimensions and Perspectives at the Dawn of the 21st Century]'' / Ed. by Leonid E. Grinin, Tessaleno C. Devezas, and Andrey V. Korotayev. Volgograd: Uchitel, 2012. P. 23–64.&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph Schumpeter]] (particularly their research on [[business cycles]] and the concepts of three basic modes of economic organization: reciprocal, redistributive, and market modes, which Wallerstein reframed into a discussion of mini systems, world empires, and world economies).

Wallerstein sees the development of the capitalist world economy as detrimental to a large proportion of the world's population.&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel (1983). Historical Capitalism. London: Verso.&lt;/ref&gt; Wallerstein views the period since the 1970s as an "age of transition" that will give way to a future world system (or world systems) whose configuration cannot be determined in advance.&lt;ref&gt;[[Terence Hopkins|Hopkins, Terence K.]], and Immanuel Wallerstein, coordinators (1996). ''The Age of Transition''. London: Zed Books.&lt;/ref&gt;

World-systems thinkers include [[Samir Amin]], [[Giovanni Arrighi]], [[Andre Gunder Frank]], and [[Immanuel Wallerstein]], with major contributions by [[Christopher Chase-Dunn]], [[Beverly Silver]], [[Volker Bornschier]], [[Janet Abu Lughod]], [[Thomas D. Hall]], [[Kunibert Raffer]], [[Theotonio dos Santos]], Dale Tomich, Jason W. Moore and others.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; In sociology, a primary alternative perspective is [[World Polity Theory]], as formulated by [[John W. Meyer]].{{citation needed|date=October 2016}}

===Dependency theory===
{{Main article|Dependency theory}}
World-systems analysis builds upon but also differs fundamentally from [[dependency theory]]. While accepting world inequality, the world market and imperialism as fundamental features of historical capitalism, Wallerstein broke with orthodox dependency theory's central proposition. For Wallerstein, core countries do not exploit poor countries for two basic reasons.

Firstly, core capitalists exploit workers in all zones of the capitalist world economy (not just the periphery) and therefore, the crucial redistribution between core and periphery is surplus value, not "wealth" or "resources" abstractly conceived. Secondly, core states do not exploit poor states, as dependency theory proposes, because capitalism is organised around an inter-regional and transnational division of labor rather than an international division of labour.

During the Industrial Revolution, for example, English capitalists exploited slaves (unfree workers) in the cotton zones of the American South, a peripheral region within a semiperipheral country, United States.&lt;ref&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel (1989). The Modern World-System III. San Diego: Academic Press&lt;/ref&gt;

From a largely Weberian perspective, [[Fernando Henrique Cardoso]] described the main tenets of dependency theory as follows:

* There is a financial and technological penetration of the [[periphery countries|periphery]] and [[semi-periphery countries]] by the developed capitalist [[core countries]].
* That produces an unbalanced economic structure within the peripheral societies and between them and the central countries.
* That leads to limitations upon self-sustained growth in the periphery.
* That helps the appearance of specific patterns of class relations.
* They require modifications in the role of the state to guarantee the functioning of the economy and the political articulation of a society, which contains, within itself, foci of inarticulateness and structural imbalance.&lt;ref&gt;Cardoso, F. H. (1979). Development under Fire. Mexico D.F.: Instituto Latinoamericano de Estudios Transnacionales, DEE/D/24 i, Mayo (Mexico 20 D.F., Apartado 85 - 025). Cited after Arno Tausch, Almas Heshmati, [http://ftp.iza.org/dp4393.pdf Re-Orient? MNC Penetration and Contemporary Shifts in the Global Political Economy], September 2009, IZA Discussion Paper No. 4393&lt;/ref&gt;

Dependency and world system theory propose that the [[poverty]] and backwardness of poor countries are caused by their peripheral position in the international [[division of labor]]. Since the capitalist world system evolved, the distinction between the central and the peripheral nations has grown and diverged. In recognizing a tripartite pattern in division of labor, world-systems analysis criticized [[dependency theory]] with its bimodal system of only cores and peripheries.

===Immanuel Wallerstein===
The best-known version of the world-systems approach was developed by [[Immanuel Wallerstein]].&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; Wallerstein notes that world-systems analysis calls for an unidisciplinary historical social science and contends that the modern disciplines, products of the 19th century, are deeply flawed because they are not separate logics, as is manifest for example in the ''de facto'' overlap of analysis among scholars of the disciplines.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; Wallerstein offers several definitions of a [[world-system]], defining it in 1974 briefly:

{{quote|a system is defined as a unit with a single division of labor and multiple cultural systems.&lt;ref name="Wallerstein"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wallerstein|first=Immanuel|date=Sep 1974|title=Wallerstein. 1974. "The Rise and Future Demise of the World-Capitalist System: Concepts for Comparative Analysis|journal=[[Comparative Studies in Society and History]]|volume=16|issue=4|page=390|url=http://bev.berkeley.edu/ipe/readings/Wallerstein.pdf}} Cited after [http://www.sociology.emory.edu/globalization/theories01.html]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He also offered a longer definition:

{{quote|...a social system, one that has boundaries, structures, member groups, rules of legitimation, and coherence. Its life is made up of the conflicting forces which hold it together by tension and tear it apart as each group seeks eternally to remold it to its advantage. It has the characteristics of an organism, in that it has a life-span over which its characteristics change in some respects and remain stable in others. One can define its structures as being at different times strong or weak in terms of the internal logic of its functioning.|&lt;ref&gt;[[Immanuel Wallerstein]] (1974) ''The Modern World-System'', New York, Academic Press, pp. 347-57.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In 1987, Wallerstein again defined it:

{{quote|...&amp;nbsp;not the system of the world, but a system that is a world and which can be, most often has been, located in an area less than the entire globe. World-systems analysis argues that the units of social reality within which we operate, whose rules constrain us, are for the most part such world-systems (other than the now extinct, small minisystems that once existed on the earth). World-systems analysis argues that there have been thus far only two varieties of world-systems: world-economies and world empires. A world-empire (examples, the [[Roman Empire]], [[Han China]]) are large bureaucratic structures with a single political center and an axial division of labor, but multiple cultures. A world-economy is a large axial division of labor with multiple political centers and multiple cultures. In English, the hyphen is essential to indicate these concepts. "World system" without a hyphen suggests that there has been only one world-system in the history of the world.|&lt;ref name=IW/&gt;}}

Wallerstein characterises the world system as a set of mechanisms, which redistributes surplus value from the ''[[periphery countries|periphery]]'' to the ''[[core countries|core]]''. In his terminology, the ''core'' is the developed, [[industrialized]] part of the world, and the ''periphery'' is the "[[underdeveloped]]", typically raw materials-exporting, poor part of the world; the ''market'' being the means by which the ''core'' exploits the ''periphery''.

Apart from them, Wallerstein defines four temporal features of the world system. ''Cyclical rhythms'' represent the short-term fluctuation of [[economy]], and ''secular trends'' mean deeper long run tendencies, such as general [[economic growth]] or decline.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt;&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; The term ''contradiction'' means a general controversy in the system, usually concerning some short term versus long term tradeoffs. For example, the problem of [[underconsumption]], wherein the driving down of wages increases the profit for capitalists in the short term, but in the long term, the decreasing of wages may have a crucially harmful effect by reducing the demand for the product. The last temporal feature is the ''crisis'': a crisis occurs if a constellation of circumstances brings about the end of the system.

In Wallerstein's view, there have been three kinds of historical systems across human history: "mini-systems" or what anthropologists call bands, tribes, and small chiefdoms, and two types of world systems, one that is politically unified and the other is not (single state world [[empire]]s and multi-polity world economies).&lt;ref name=IW/&gt;&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; World systems are larger, and are ethnically diverse. Modernity is unique in being the first and only fully capitalist world economy to have emerged around 1450 to 1550 and to have [[geography|geographically]] expanded across the entire planet, by about 1900. Not being political unified, many political units are included within the world system loosely tied together in an interstate system. Efficient division of labor is the unifying element of the different units, and it is also a function of capitalism, a system based on [[competition]] between free producers using [[wage labour|free labor]] with free commodities, 'free' meaning available for sale and purchase on a [[market (economics)|market]]. More specifically, it can be described as focusing on endless accumulation of capital; in other words, accumulation of capital in order to accumulate more capital. Such capitalism has a mutually dependent relationship with the world economy since it provides the efficient division of labour, the unifying element of the world economy, through the process of accumulating wealth. Likewise, such capitalism is dependent on the world economy since the latter provides a large market and a multiplicity of states, enabling capitalists to choose to work with states helping their interests.&lt;ref name=IW-D /&gt;

===Research questions===
World-systems theory asks several key questions:

* How is the world system affected by changes in its components (e.g. nations, ethnic groups, social classes, etc.)?&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* How does it affect its components?&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* To what degree, if any, does the core need the periphery to be underdeveloped?&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* What causes world systems to change?&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* What system may replace capitalism?&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;

Some questions are more specific to certain subfields; for example, [[Marxist]]s would concern themselves whether world-systems theory is a useful or unhelpful development of Marxist theories.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;

==Characteristics==
{{See also|Core-periphery}}

World-systems analysis argues that capitalism, as a historical system, has always integrated a variety of labor forms within a functioning division of labor (world economy). Countries do not have economies but are part of the world economy. Far from being separate societies or worlds, the world economy manifests a tripartite [[division of labor]], with core, semiperipheral and peripheral zones. In the core zones, businesses, with the support of states they operate within, monopolise the most profitable activities of the division of labor.

There are many ways to attribute a specific country to the core, semi-periphery, or periphery. Using an empirically based sharp formal definition of "[[wikt:domination|domination]]" in a two-country relationship, Piana in 2004 defined the "core" as made up of "free countries" dominating others without being dominated, the "semi-periphery" as the countries that are dominated (usually, but not necessarily, by core countries) but at the same time dominating others (usually in the periphery) and "periphery" as the countries dominated. Based on 1998 data, the full list of countries in the three regions, together with a discussion of methodology, can be found.

The late 18th and early 19th centuries marked a great turning point in the development of capitalism in that capitalists achieved state society power in the key states, which furthered the industrial revolution marking the rise of capitalism. World-systems analysis contends that capitalism as a historical system formed earlier and that countries do not "develop" in stages, but the system does, and events have a different meaning as a phase in the development of historical capitalism, the emergence of the three ideologies of the national developmental mythology (the idea that countries can develop through stages if they pursue the right set of policies): conservatism, liberalism, and radicalism.

Proponents of world-systems analysis see the world stratification system the same way [[Karl Marx]] viewed class (ownership versus nonownership of the means of production) and [[Max Weber]] viewed class (which, in addition to ownership, stressed occupational skill level in the production process). The core nations primarily own and control the major means of production in the world and perform the higher-level production tasks. The periphery nations own very little of the world's means of production (even when they are located in periphery nations) and provide less-skilled labour. Like a class system with a nation, class positions in the [[world economy]] result in an unequal distribution of rewards or resources. The core nations receive the greatest share of surplus production, and periphery nations receive the smallest share. Furthermore, core nations are usually able to purchase raw materials and other goods from non-core nations at low prices and demand higher prices for their exports to non-core nations. Chirot (1986) lists the five most important benefits coming to core nations from their domination of periphery nations:

# Access to a large quantity of raw material
# Cheap labour
# Enormous profits from direct [[capital investments]]
# A market for [[exports]]
# Skilled professional labor through [[human migration|migration]] of these people from the non-core to the core.&lt;ref name=chirot1986&gt;Chirot, Daniel. 1986. ''Social Change in the Modern Era.'' New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Wallerstein, the unique qualities of the modern world system include its capitalistic nature, its truly global nature, and the fact that it is a world economy that has not become politically unified into a world empire.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;

===Core nations===
{{Main article|core countries}}
* Are the most economically diversified, wealthy, and powerful (economically and militarily)&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;
* Have strong central governments, controlling extensive bureaucracies and powerful militaries&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;
* Have stronger and more complex state institutions that help manage economic affairs internally and externally
* Have a sufficient tax base so state institutions can provide infrastructure for a strong economy
* Highly industrialised and produce manufactured goods rather than raw materials for export&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* Increasingly tend to specialise in information, finance and service industries
* More often in the forefront of new technologies and new industries. Examples today include high-technology electronic and biotechnology industries. Another example would be assembly-line auto production in the early 20th century.
* Has strong [[bourgeois]] and [[working class]]es&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* Have significant means of influence over non-core nations&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* Relatively independent of outside control

Throughout the history of the modern world system, there has been a group of core nations competing with one another for access to the world's resources, economic dominance and [[hegemony]] over periphery nations. Occasionally, there has been one core nation with clear dominance over others.&lt;ref name=glob/&gt; According to Immanuel Wallerstein, a core nation is dominant over all the others when it has a lead in three forms of economic dominance over a period of time:

# '''''Productivity dominance''''' allows a country to produce products of greater quality at a cheaper price, compared to other countries.
# Productivity dominance may lead to '''''trade dominance.''''' Now, there is a favorable balance of trade for the dominant nation since more countries are buying the products of the dominant country than buying from them.
# Trade dominance may lead to '''''financial dominance'''''. Now, more money is coming into the country than going out. Bankers of the dominant nation tend to receive more control of the world's financial resources.&lt;ref name=wallerstein1980&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel. 1980. The Modern World System II: Mercantilism and the Consolidation of the European World-Economy, 1600-1750. New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Military]] dominance is also likely after a nation reaches these three rankings. However, it has been posited that throughout the modern world system, no nation has been able to use its military to gain economic dominance. Each of the past dominant nations became dominant with fairly small levels of military spending and began to lose economic dominance with military expansion later on.&lt;ref name=kennedy1987&gt;Kennedy, Paul. 1987. ''The Rise and Fall of the Great Powers: Economic Change and Military Conflict From 1500 to 2000.'' New York: Random House.&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, cores were found in Northwestern Europe (England, France, Netherlands) but were later in other parts of the world (such as the United States, Canada, and Australia).&lt;ref name=glob/&gt;&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;

===Peripheral nations===
{{Main article|Periphery countries}}
* Are the least economically diversified
* Have relatively weak governments&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;
* Have relatively weak institutions, with tax bases too small to support infrastructural development
* Tend to depend on one type of economic activity, often by extracting and exporting raw materials to core nations&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;
* Tend to be the least industrialized&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;
* Are often targets for investments from [[multinational corporation|multinational]] (or [[international corporation|transnational]]) [[corporation]]s from core nations that come into the country to exploit cheap unskilled labor in order to export back to core nations
* Have a small bourgeois and a large peasant classes&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;
* Tend to have populations with high percentages of poor and uneducated people
* Tend to have very high social inequality because of small upper classes that own most of the land and have profitable ties to multinational corporations
* Tend to be extensively influenced by core nations and their multinational corporations and often forced to follow economic policies that help core nations and harm the long-term economic prospects of peripheral nations.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;

Historically, peripheries were found outside Europe, such as in [[Latin America]] and today in [[sub-Saharan Africa]].&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;

===Semi-peripheral nations===
{{Main article|Semiperiphery countries}}
Semi-peripheral nations are those that are midway between the core and periphery.&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; Thus, they have to keep themselves from falling into the category of peripheral nations and at the same time, they strive to join the category of core nations. Therefore, they tend to apply protectionist policies most aggressively among the three categories of nations.&lt;ref name=IW-D&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel Maurice. "The Modern World System as a Capitalist World-Economy." ''World-Systems Analysis: An Introduction.'' Durham: Duke UP, 2004. 23-30. Print.&lt;/ref&gt; They tend to be countries moving towards industrialization and more diversified economies. These regions often have relatively developed and diversified economies but are not dominant in international trade.&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; They tend to export more to peripheral nations and import more from core nations in trade. According to some scholars, such as Chirot, they are not as subject to outside manipulation as peripheral societies; but according to others (Barfield), they have "periperial-like" relations to the core.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=chirot1977&gt;Chirot, Daniel. 1977. Social Change in the Twentieth Century. New York: Harcourt Brace Jovanovich.&lt;/ref&gt; While in the sphere of influence of some cores, semiperipheries also tend to exert their own control over some peripheries.&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; Further, semi-peripheries act as buffers between cores and peripheries&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; and thus "...partially deflect the political pressures which groups primarily located in peripheral areas might otherwise direct against core-states" and stabilise the world system.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=glob/&gt;

Semi-peripheries can come into existence from developing peripheries and declining cores.&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; Historically, two examples of semiperipheral nations would be Spain and Portugal, which fell from their early core positions but still managed to retain influence in Latin America.&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; Those countries imported silver and gold from their American colonies but then had to use it to pay for manufactured goods from core countries such as England and France.&lt;ref name=PH/&gt; In the 20th century, nations like the "settler colonies" of Australia, Canada and New Zealand had a semiperipheral status. In the 21st century, nations like Brazil, Russia, India, Israel, China, South Korea and South Africa (BRICS) are usually considered semiperipheral.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Morales Ruvalcaba|first1=Daniel Efrén|title=INSIDE THE BRIC: ANALYSIS OF THE SEMIPERIPHERAL NATURE OF BRAZIL, RUSSIA, INDIA AND CHINA|journal=Austral: Brazilian Journal of Strategy &amp; International Relations|date=11 September 2013|volume=2|issue=4|url=http://seer.ufrgs.br/index.php/austral/article/view/40942/26976|language=es|issn=2238-6912}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===External areas===
External areas are those that maintain socially necessary divisions of labor independent of the capitalist world economy.&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;

==Interpretation of world history==
[[File:Archaic globalization.svg|thumb|right|400px|The 13th century world-system]]
Before the 16th century, [[Europe]] was dominated by [[feudal]] economies.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; European economies grew from mid-12th to 14th century but from 14th to mid 15th century, they suffered from a major crisis.&lt;ref name=glob&gt;Frank Lechner, [http://www.sociology.emory.edu/globalization/theories01.html Globalization theories: World-System Theory], 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; Wallerstein explains this crisis as caused by the following:
# stagnation or even decline of agricultural production, increasing the burden of peasants,
# decreased agricultural productivity caused by changing climatological conditions ([[Little Ice Age]]),
# an increase in epidemics ([[Black Death]]),
# optimum level of the feudal economy having been reached in its [[economic cycle]]; the economy moved beyond it and entered a [[Depression (economics)|depression]] period.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt;

As a response to the failure of the feudal system, Europe embraced the capitalist system.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; Europeans were motivated to develop technology to explore and trade around the world, using their superior military to take control of the trade routes.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt; Europeans exploited their initial small advantages, which led to an accelerating process of accumulation of wealth and power in Europe.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt;

Wallerstein notes that never before had an economic system encompassed that much of the world, with trade links crossing so many political boundaries.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; In the past, geographically large economic systems existed but were mostly limited to spheres of domination of large empires (such as the [[Roman Empire]]); development of capitalism enabled the world economy to extend beyond individual states.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; [[International division of labor]] was crucial in deciding what relationships exists between different regions, their labor conditions and political systems.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; For classification and comparison purposes, Wallerstein introduced the categories of core, semi-periphery, periphery, and external countries.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; Cores monopolized the capital-intensive production, and the rest of the world could provide only workforce and raw resources.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt; The resulting inequality reinforced existing unequal development.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt;

According to Wallerstein there have only been three periods in which a core nation dominated in the modern world-system, with each lasting less than one hundred years. In the initial centuries of the rise of Europe, Northwestern Europe constituted the core, Mediterranean Europe the semiperiphery, and Eastern Europe and the Western hemisphere (and parts of Asia) the periphery.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt;&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; Around 1450, Spain and Portugal took the early lead when conditions became right for a capitalist world-economy. They led the way in establishing overseas colonies. However, Portugal and Spain lost their lead, primarily by becoming overextended with [[empire]]-building. It became too expensive to dominate and protect so many colonial territories around the world.&lt;ref name="kennedy1987" /&gt;&lt;ref name="chirot1977" /&gt;&lt;ref name=wallerstein1974&gt;Wallerstein, Immanuel. 1974. ''The Modern World System: Capitalist Agriculture and the Origins of the European World-Economy in the 16th Century.'' New York: Academic Press.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Fleuten 1647.jpg|right|thumb|Dutch [[fluyt]]s of the seventeenth century]]
The first nation to gain clear dominance was the Netherlands in the 17th century, after its revolution led to a new financial system that many historians consider revolutionary.&lt;ref name="kennedy1987" /&gt; An impressive [[shipbuilding]] industry also contributed to their economic dominance through more exports to other countries.&lt;ref name="chirot1986" /&gt; Eventually, other countries began to copy the financial methods and efficient production created by the Dutch. After the Dutch gained their dominant status, the [[standard of living]] rose, pushing up production costs.&lt;ref name="wallerstein1980" /&gt;

Dutch [[bankers]] began to go outside of the country seeking profitable investments, and the flow of [[capital (economics)|capital]] moved, especially to England.&lt;ref name="kennedy1987" /&gt; By the end of the 17th century, conflict among core nations increased as a result of the economic decline of the Dutch. Dutch [[financial investment]] helped England gain [[productivity]] and trade dominance, and Dutch military support helped England to defeat France, the other country competing for dominance at the time.

[[File:British Empire 1921.png|left|400px|thumb|Map showing the British Empire in 1921]]
In the 19th century, Britain replaced the Netherlands as the hegemon.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt; As a result of the new British dominance, the world system became relatively stable again during the 19th century. The British began to expand globally, with many colonies in the New World, Africa, and Asia. The colonial system began to place a strain on the British military and, along with other factors, led to an economic decline. Again there was a great deal of core conflict after the British lost their clear dominance. This time it was Germany, and later Italy and Japan that provided the new threat.

[[Industrialization]] was another ongoing process during British dominance, resulting in the diminishing importance of the agricultural sector.&lt;ref name=PH /&gt; In the 18th century, Britain was Europe's leading industrial and agricultural producer; by 1900, only 10% of England's population was working in the [[agricultural sector]].&lt;ref name=PH /&gt;

By 1900, the modern world system appeared very different from that of a century earlier in that most of the periphery societies had already been colonised by one of the older core nations.&lt;ref name="chirot1986" /&gt; In 1800, the old European core claimed 35% of the world's territory, but by 1914, it claimed 85% of the world's territory, with the [[Scramble for Africa]] closing out the imperial era.&lt;ref name="kennedy1987" /&gt; If a core nation wanted periphery areas to exploit as had done the Dutch and British, these periphery areas had to be taken from another core nation, which the US did by way of the [[Spanish–American War]], and Germany, and then Japan and Italy, attempted to do in the leadup to [[World War II]]. The modern world system was thus geographically global, and even the most remote regions of the world had all been integrated into the global economy.&lt;ref name=TB /&gt;&lt;ref name=glob /&gt;

As countries vied for core status, so did the United States. The [[American Civil War]] led to more power for the Northern industrial elites, who were now better able to pressure the government for policies helping industrial expansion. Like the Dutch bankers, British bankers were putting more investment toward the United States. The US had a small [[military budget]] compared to other industrial nations at the time.&lt;ref name="kennedy1987" /&gt;

The US began to take the place of the British as a new dominant nation after [[World War I]].&lt;ref name=glob /&gt; With Japan and Europe in ruins after [[World War II]], the US was able to dominate the modern world system more than any other country in history, while the [[USSR]] and to a lesser extent China were viewed as primary threats.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt; At its height, US economic reach accounted for over half of the world's industrial production, owned two thirds of the [[gold reserves]] in the world and supplied one third of the world's exports.&lt;ref name="kennedy1987" /&gt;

However, since the end of the [[Cold War]], the future of US hegemony has been questioned by some scholars, as its hegemonic position has been in decline for a few decades.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt; By the end of the 20th century, the core of the wealthy industrialized countries was composed of Western Europe, the United States, Japan and a rather limited selection of other countries.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt; The semiperiphery was typically composed of independent states that had not achieved Western levels of influence, while poor [[decolonization|former colonies]] of the West formed most of the periphery.&lt;ref name=glob /&gt;

==Criticisms==
World-systems theory has attracted criticisms from its rivals; notably for being too focused on economy and not enough on [[culture]] and for being too core-centric and state-centric.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; [[William I. Robinson]] has criticized world-systems theory for its nation-state centrism, state-structuralist approach, and its inability to conceptualize the rise of globalization.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Robinson|first=William I.|date=2011-11-01|title=Globalization and the sociology of Immanuel Wallerstein: A critical appraisal|url=http://iss.sagepub.com/content/26/6/723|journal=International Sociology|language=en|volume=26|issue=6|pages=723–745|doi=10.1177/0268580910393372|issn=0268-5809}}&lt;/ref&gt; Robinson suggests that world-systems theory doesn't account for emerging transnational social forces and the relationships forged between them and global institutions serving their interests.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; These forces operate on a global, rather than state system and cannot be understood by Wallerstein's nation-centered approach.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to Wallerstein himself, critique of the world-systems approach comes from four directions: the positivists, the orthodox Marxists, the state autonomists, and the culturalists.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; The positivists criticise the approach as too prone to [[generalization]], lacking [[quantitative data]] and failing to put forth a [[falsifiable]] proposition.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; Orthodox Marxists find the world-systems approach deviating too far from orthodox Marxist principles, such as by not giving enough weight to the concept of [[social class]].&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; The state autonomists criticize the theory for blurring the boundaries between state and businesses.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; Further, the positivists and the state autonomists argue that state should be the central [[unit of analysis]].&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; Finally, the culturalists argue that world-systems theory puts too much importance on the economy and not enough on the culture.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt; In Wallerstein's own words:

{{quote|In short, most of the criticisms of world-systems analysis criticize it for what it explicitly proclaims as its perspective. World-systems analysis views these other modes of analysis as defective and/or limiting in scope and calls for unthinking them.&lt;ref name=IW/&gt;}}

One of the fundamental conceptual problems of the world-system theory is that the assumptions that define its actual conceptual units are social systems. The assumptions, which define them, need to be examined as well as how they are related to each other and how one changes into another. The essential argument of the world-system theory is that in the 16th century a capitalist world economy developed, which could be described as a world system.&lt;ref name="Pieterse"&gt;Jan Nederveen Pieterse,  A Critique of World System Theory, in International Sociology, Volume 3, Issue no. 3, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt; The following is a theoretical critique concerned with the basic claims of world-system theory:
"There are today no socialist systems in the world-economy any more than there are feudal systems because there is only one world system. It is a world-economy and it is by definition capitalist in form." (Wallerstein 1979)&lt;ref name=Pieterse/&gt;

Robert Brenner has pointed out that the prioritization of the world market means the neglect of local class structures and class struggles:
"They fail to take into account either the way in which these class structures themselves emerge as the outcome of class struggles whose results are incomprehensible in terms merely of market forces." (Brenner 1982)&lt;ref name=Pieterse/&gt; Robert Brenner: Director of the Center for Social Theory and Comparative History at UCLA

Another criticism is that of reductionism made by Theda Skocpol: she believes the interstate system is far from being a simple superstructure of the capitalist world economy:
"The international states system as a transnational structure of military competition was not originally created by capitalism. Throughout modern world history, it represents an analytically autonomous level [... of] world capitalism, but [is] not reducible to it." (Skocpol 1979)&lt;ref name=Pieterse/&gt;

A concept that we can perceive as critique and mostly as renewal is the concept of coloniality ([[Anibal Quijano]], 2000, Nepantla, Coloniality of power, eurocentrism and Latin America &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.unc.edu/~aescobar/wan/wanquijano.pdf|title=Quijano, 2000, Nepantla, Coloniality of power, eurocentrism and Latin America|author=|date=|website=unc.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;). Issued from the think tank of the group "modernity/coloniality" ([[:es:Grupo modernidad/colonialidad]]) in Latin America, it re-uses the concept of world working division and core/periphery system in its system of coloniality. But criticizing the "core-centric" origin of World-system and its only economical development, "coloniality" allows further conception of how power still processes in a colonial way over worldwide populations (Ramon Grosfogel, "the epistemic decolonial turn" 2007 &lt;ref&gt;Ramon Grosfogel, "the epistemic decolonial turn", 2007&lt;/ref&gt;):" by "colonial situations" I mean the cultural, political, sexual, spiritual, epistemic and economic oppression/exploitation of subordinate racialized/ethnic groups by dominant racialized/ethnic groups with or without the existence of colonial administration". Coloniality covers, so far, several fields such as coloniality of gender ([[Maria Lugones]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://globalstudies.trinity.duke.edu/wp-content/themes/cgsh/materials/WKO/v2d2_Lugones.pdf|title=M. Lugones, coloniality of gender, 2008|author=|date=|website=duke.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;), coloniality of "being" (Maldonado Torres), coloniality of knowledge ([[Walter Mignolo]]) and [[Coloniality of power]] ([[Anibal Quijano]]).

==New developments==
New developments in world systems research include studies on the cyclical processes. More specifically, it refers to the cycle of leading industries or products (ones that are new and have an important share of the overall world market for commodities), which is equal to dissolution of quasi-monopolies or other forms of partial monopolies achieved by core nations. Such forms of partial monopolies are achievable through ownership of leading industries or products, which require technological capabilities, patents, restrictions on imports and/or exports, government subsidies, etc. Such capabilities are most often found in core nations, which accumulate capital through achieving such quasi-monopolies with leading industries or products.

As capital is accumulated, employment and wage also increase, creating a sense of prosperity. This leads to increased production, and sometimes even [[overproduction]], causing price competition to arise. To lower production costs, production processes of the leading industries or products are relocated to semi-peripheral nations. When competition increases and quasi-monopolies cease to exist, their owners, often core nations, move on to other new leading industries or products, and the cycle continues.&lt;ref name=IW-D /&gt;

Other new developments include the consequences of the [[dissolution of the Soviet Union]], the roles of [[gender]] and the culture, studies of [[slavery]] and incorporation of new regions into the world system and the precapitalist world systems.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; Arguably, the greatest source of renewal in world-systems analysis since 2000 has been the synthesis of world-system and environmental approaches. Key figures in the "greening" of world-systems analysis include Minqi Li, Jason W. Moore, Andreas Malm, Stephen Bunker, Alf Hornborg, and Richard York.

===Time period===
Wallerstein traces the origin of today's world-system to the "long 16th century" (a period that began with the [[voyages of Christopher Columbus|discovery of the Americas]] by Western European sailors and ended with the [[English Revolution]] of 1640).&lt;ref name=TB/&gt;&lt;ref name=glob/&gt;&lt;ref name=PH/&gt;  And, according to Wallerstein, globalization, or the becoming of the world's system, is a process coterminous with the spread and development of capitalism over the past 500 years.

[[Janet Abu Lughod]] argues that a pre-modern world system extensive across Eurasia existed in the 13th century prior to the formation of the modern world-system identified by Wallerstein. [[Janet Abu Lughod]] contends that the [[Secret History of the Mongols|Mongol Empire]] played an important role in stitching together the Chinese, Indian, Muslim and European regions in the 13th century, before the rise of the modern world system.&lt;ref&gt;Abu-Lugod, Janet (1989), "Before European Hegemony: The World System A.D. 1250-1350"&lt;/ref&gt; In debates, Wallerstein contends that Lughod's system was not a "world-system" because it did not entail integrated production networks, but it was instead a vast trading network.

[[File:Silk route.jpg|thumb|left|The 11th century world system]]

[[Andre Gunder Frank]] goes further and claims that a global world system that includes Asia, Europe and Africa has existed since the [[4th millennium BCE]]. The centre of this system was in Asia, specifically China.&lt;ref&gt;André Gunder Frank, Barry K. Gills, The world system: five hundred years or five thousand?, Routledge, 1996, {{ISBN|0-415-15089-2}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=LVAWQ1D8UJUC&amp;pg=PA3&amp;dq=%22world-system+is%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=ALVRTLv1J5SssAa_15zoAQ&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=2&amp;ved=0CC4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22world-system%20is%22&amp;f=false Google Print, p.3]&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrey Korotayev]] goes even further than Frank and dates the beginning of the world system formation to the 10th millennium BCE and connects it with the start of the [[Neolithic Revolution]] in the Middle East. According to him, the centre of this system was originally in [[Western Asia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://jwsr.ucr.edu/archive/vol11/number1/pdf/jwsr-v11n1-korotayev.pdf Korotayev A.

===Current research===
Wallerstein's theories are widely recognized throughout the world. In the United States, one of the hubs of world-systems research is at the [[Fernand Braudel Center|Fernand Braudel Center for the Study of Economies, Historical Systems and Civilizations]], at [[Binghamton University]].&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; Among the most important related periodicals are the ''[[Journal of World-Systems Research]]'', published by the [[American Sociological Association]]'s Section on the Political Economy of the World System (PEWS), and the ''[[Review, A Journal of the Fernand Braudel Center|Review]]'', published the Braudel Center.&lt;ref name=TB/&gt; 

Edythe E. Weeks asserts the proposition that it may be possible to consider, and apply critical insights, to prevent future patterns from emerging in ways to repeat outcomes harmful to humanity. (See ''Outer Space Development, Space Law and International Relations: A Method for Elucidating Seeds'' (Cambridge Scholars Publishing, 2012)). Her current research, as a Fulbright Specialist, further suggests that new territories such as the Antarctic Peninsula, Antarctica, the Arctic and various regions of outer space, including low Earth orbit, the geostationary orbit, Near Earth orbit are currently in the process of colonization. By applying lessons learned from our past, we can change the future towards a direction less likely to be widely criticized.

Muhammed Asadi suggests that the modern World System is highly militarized and a counterpart of the US permanent war economy where a global division of labor based on military Keynesian stabilization exists concomitant with economic accumulation. He calls these countries, militarized states, whose superior economic growth stabilizes the World System run by the command states (counterpart to Wallerstein's Core but includes military and political domination in addition to financial and trade domination) just like military spending in the US stabilizes the US economy. Militarization and wars are therefore encouraged by the Command States and facilitated by them. Militarized States have a life cycle in which destruction is almost inevitable and since their economic growth stabilizes the dominant economies it seldom translates into personal economic development &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://opensiuc.lib.siu.edu/dissertations/447/|title=The Military, Economy and the State: A New International System Analysis|first=Asadi, Muhammed|last=A.|date=16 May 2018|journal=Dissertations}}&lt;/ref&gt;
