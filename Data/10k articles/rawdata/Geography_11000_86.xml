Alcoves are weathering features common in dissected horizontal strata.  Alcoves form where chemical and physical weathering is concentrated along horizontal discontinuities where water and salts concetrate, such as the contact between a sandstone and an underlying shale bed. In the case of layered sandstones, an alcove may later be enlarged by [[Exfoliation (geology)|exfoliation]] of upper layers.  This is commonly seen in the sandstone alcoves of the [[Colorado Plateau]], like those in [[Navajo Sandstone]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://w3.salemstate.edu/~lhanson/gls210/gls210_wea2.htm  Products of Weathering, Lindley Hanson, Department of Geological Sciences, Salem State College] from salemstate.edu accessed October 21, 2018.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Autonomous Region of Bougainville''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|b|oʊ|g|ən|ˌ|v|ɪ|l}} {{respell|BOH|gən|VIL}}), previously known as the '''North Solomons Province''', is an [[Provinces of Papua New Guinea|autonomous region]] in [[Papua New Guinea]]. The largest island is [[Bougainville Island]] (also the largest of the [[Solomon Islands (archipelago)|Solomon Islands archipelago]]). The province also includes [[Buka Island]] and assorted outlying nearby islands including the [[Carteret Islands|Carterets]]. The capital is temporarily [[Buka, Papua New Guinea|Buka]], though it is expected that [[Arawa, Papua New Guinea|Arawa]] will be the permanent provincial capital. The population of the province is 249,358 (2011 census).

[[Bougainville Island]] is [[ecology|ecologically]] and [[physical geography|geographically]] part of the Solomon Islands archipelago but is not [[political geography|politically]] part of the nation of  [[Solomon Islands]]. [[Buka Island|Buka]], Bougainville, and most of the Solomons are part of the [[Solomon Islands rain forests]] [[ecoregion]]. The region's biodiversity is heavily threatened by [[mining]] activities, mostly conducted by foreign investors.&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.theguardian.com/world/2018/jan/10/bougainville-imposes-moratorium-on-panguna-mine-over-fears-of-civil-unrest|title=Bougainville imposes moratorium on Panguna mine over fears of civil unrest|first=Helen|last=Davidson|date=10 January 2018|website=the Guardian}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
{{Main|History of Bougainville}}
[[File:White Island, Bougainville.jpg|thumbnail|White Island, Bougainville]]

The island was named after the French [[explorer]] [[Louis Antoine de Bougainville]], who made expeditions to the Pacific. He is also the namesake of the tropical flowering vines of the genus ''[[Bougainvillea]]''. In 1885, the island was taken over by a German administration as part of [[German New Guinea]]. Australia occupied it in 1914 during World War I. After the war the [[League of Nations]] designated it as a [[League of Nations mandate|mandatory power]] and administered the island from 1918 until the Japanese invaded it in 1942 during World War II.

During [[World War II]], the island was occupied by Australian, American and Japanese forces. It was an important base for the [[RAAF]], [[RNZAF]] and [[United States Army Air Forces|USAAF]]. On 8 March 1944, during the [[Pacific War]], American forces were attacked by Japanese troops on Hill 700 on this island. The [[battle]] lasted five days, ending with a Japanese [[withdrawal (military)|retreat]].

Australia took over administration of the island when that war ended in 1945, managing it until [[Papua New Guinea Independence Act 1975|Papua New Guinea independence]] in 1975. Bougainville was appointed as a United Nations mandatory power, Australia having accepted dominion sovereignty under the [[Statute of Westminster 1931]] in the [[Statute of Westminster Adoption Act 1942]] and therefore being formally empowered to do so. It administered British and German New Guinea, but was not the official colonial power.

===Independence (1975) to present===
The island is rich in [[copper]] and [[gold]]. A large mine was established at [[Panguna]] in the early 1970s by [[Bougainville Copper Limited]], a subsidiary of [[Rio Tinto Group|Rio Tinto]]. Disputes by regional residents with the company over adverse environmental impacts, failure to share financial benefits, and negative social changes brought by the mine resulted in a local revival for a [[secessionist]] movement that had been dormant. Activists proclaimed the independence of Bougainville ([[Republic of North Solomons]]) in 1975 and in 1990, but both times government forces suppressed the separatists.

In 1988, the [[Bougainville Revolutionary Army]] (BRA) increased their activity significantly. Prime Minister Sir [[Rabbie Namaliu]] ordered the Papua New Guinea Defence Force (PNGDF) to put down the rebellion, and the conflict escalated into a [[Bougainville Civil War|civil war]]. The PNGDF retreated from permanent positions on Bougainville in 1990, but continued military action. The conflict involved pro-independence and loyalist Bougainvillean groups as well as the PNGDF. The war claimed an estimated 15,000 to 20,000 lives.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

In 1996, Prime Minister Sir [[Julius Chan]] hired [[Sandline International]], a [[private military company]] previously involved in supplying [[mercenary|mercenaries]] in the civil war in [[Sierra Leone]], to put down the rebellion. The [[Sandline affair]] was a controversial incident that resulted from use of these mercenary troops.

==Government and politics==
{{Politics of Bougainville}}
{{main|Autonomous Bougainville Government}}

The Bougainville conflict ended in 1997, after negotiations brokered by New Zealand.  A peace agreement was completed in 2000 and, together with [[Rotokas Record|disarmament]], provided for the establishment of an [[Autonomous Bougainville Government]]. The parties agreed to have a referendum in the future on whether the island should become politically independent.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.wsws.org/articles/2001/may2001/png-m23.shtml Will Marshall, "Papua New Guinea government obtains shaky weapons disposal pact in Bougainville"], ''World Socialist Web Site'', May 23, 2001.  Accessed on line March 4, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

Elections for the first autonomous government were held in May and June 2005; [[Joseph Kabui]], an independence leader, was elected President. He died in office on 6 June 2008. After interim elections to fill the remainder of his term, John Momis was elected as president in 2010 for a five-year term. He supports autonomy within a relationship with the national government of Papua New Guinea.

On 25 July 2005 rebel leader [[Francis Ona]] died after a short illness. A former surveyor with [[Bougainville Copper]], Ona was a key figure in the secessionist conflict and had refused to formally join the island's peace process.

In 2015 Australia announced it will establish a diplomatic post in Bougainville for the first time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Medhora|first1=Shalailah|title=Papua New Guinea not told of Australia's plans for new diplomatic post there|url=https://www.theguardian.com/australia-news/2015/jun/03/papua-new-guinea-not-told-of-australias-plans-for-new-diplomatic-post-there?CMP=ema_1731|website=The Guardian|accessdate=4 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2019 independence referendum==
[[President of the Autonomous Region of Bougainville|President]] [[John Momis]] confirmed that Bougainville will hold an [[Bougainvillean independence referendum, 2019|independence referendum]] some time before 2020 once the region has resolved some remaining issues.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://www.radioaustralia.net.au/international/radio/program/pacific-beat/bougainville-confirms-independence-referendum-before-2020/1077886|title = Bougainville confirms independence referendum before 2020 {{!}} Pacific Beat|website = www.radioaustralia.net.au|access-date = 2016-03-08
}}&lt;/ref&gt; The governments of both Bougainville and Papua New Guinea have set a tentative date of June 15, 2019 for the vote, which is the final step in the Bougainville Peace Agreement.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/304534/ball-rolling-on-bougainville-referendum|title=Ball rolling on Bougainville referendum|date=2016-05-22|website=Radio New Zealand|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, certain criteria on Bougainville's part must be met before any vote can occur, including having a viable economy and controlling the flow of illegal weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.radionz.co.nz/international/pacific-news/305199/bougainville-mp-confident-of-ongoing-international-help|title=Bougainville MP confident of ongoing international help|date=2016-05-30|website=Radio New Zealand|access-date=2016-05-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; As of September 27, 2017, none of these prerequisites have been met, with [[Prime Minister of Papua New Guinea|Papua New Guinea Prime Minister]] [[Peter O'Neill]] expressing doubt that such conditions will be met before the target date of the referendum.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2017-09-27/png-pm-casts-doubt-over-bougainville-independence-referendum/8990692|title=Bougainville independence referendum 'may not be possible': PNG PM|last=Tlozek|first=Eric|date=2017-09-27|work=ABC News|access-date=2018-01-06|language=en-AU}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Australian Strategic Policy Institute]] analyst Karl Claxton said there is a wide expectation Bougainville will vote to become independent.&lt;ref&gt;Australian Associated Press, "PNG leader apologises to Bougainville for bloody 1990s civil war", 29 January 2014 https://www.theguardian.com/world/2014/jan/29/papua-new-guinea-apologises-bougainville-civil-war&lt;/ref&gt;

==Economy==
A small percentage of the region's economy is from [[mining]]. Majority of economic growth comes from [[agriculture]] and [[aquaculture]]. The region's biodiversity, which is one of the most important in [[Oceania]], is heavily threatened by [[mining]] activities, mostly conducted by the rich bracket of society. Mining activities have caused civil unrest in the region many times. In January 2018, a moratorium on one mine was imposed by the Papua New Guinea government, in a bid to calm civil unrest against mining in the region.&lt;ref name="auto"/&gt;

==Districts and LLGs==
[[File:Un-bougainville.png|thumb|500px|District map of Bougainville (North Solomons)]]
Each province in Papua New Guinea has one or more districts, and each district has one or more Local Level Government (LLG) areas. For [[census]] purposes, the LLG areas are subdivided into wards, and those into census units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spc.int/PRISM/country/pg/Stats/Special_Products/Descrpn.htm|title=Pacific Regional Statistics - Secretariat of the Pacific Community|website=www.spc.int}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Regional leaders==

Bougainville has been headed by several different types of administration: a decentralised administration headed by a Premier (as [[North Solomons Province]] from 1975 to 1990), an appointed administrator during the height of the [[Bougainville Civil War]] (from 1990 to 1995), a Premier heading the [[Bougainville Transitional Government]] (from 1995 to 1998), the co-chairmen of the [[Bougainville Constituent Assembly]] (1999), a Governor heading a provincial government as in other parts of Papua New Guinea (2000 to 2005) and the [[Autonomous Bougainville Government]] (since 2005).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://press-files.anu.edu.au/downloads/press/p66801/mobile/ch08.html | title=8.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5227">[[File:Yugoslavia proposed banovinas 1939 1941.png|thumb|250px|Map showing the proposed Banovina of Serbia]]
The '''Banovina of Serbia''' or '''Banate of Serbia''' ({{lang-sh|Banovina Srbija}} / Бановина Србија), officially known as "'''the Serbian Lands'''" (''Srpske zemlje'' / Српске земље), was a proposed administrative unit of the [[Kingdom of Yugoslavia]]. Its creation was proposed after the establishment of the [[Banovina of Croatia]] in 1939. However, due to the Axis occupation and partition of Yugoslavia in 1941 (see [[World War II in Yugoslavia]]), the proposal was never implemented.

==The proposal==
The creation of the [[Banovina of Croatia]] in 1939–40 had been negotiated between Prime Minister [[Dragiša Cvetković]] and Croatian leader [[Vladko Maček]] (of the [[Croatian Peasant Party|HSS]]) in March–August 1939, and settled through [[Cvetković–Maček Agreement|an agreement]] on 26 August.{{sfn|Djilas|1991|p=130}} ''Croatia'' now became the only ''[[Banovinas of the Kingdom of Yugoslavia|banovina]]'' constituted on the principle of nationality, named after the majority people (with only a minority left outside it), and thus was close to a nation-state.{{sfn|Djilas|1991|pp=130–131}} The agreement had little support from Serbian political parties, and the [[Serbian Orthodox Church]] and [[Royal Yugoslav Army|Yugoslav Army]] opposed it.{{sfn|Djilas|1991|p=132}} Relations between Croatian and Serbian politicians (and Croats and Serbs) strained.{{sfn|Djilas|1991|p=132}} Its creation opened the question of the political status of the Serb people ("the [[Serbian question]]"){{sfn|Bazić|2003}} in the Kingdom of Yugoslavia, with some Serb intellectuals (notably the members of the [[Serbian Cultural Club]]) and politicians (including some members of the Yugoslav government, such as Dragiša Cvetković) proposed and planned the creation of the Serbian Banovina, which would include the territory of the existing banovinas of [[Vrbas Banovina|Vrbas]], [[Drina Banovina|Drina]], [[Danube Banovina|Danube]], [[Morava Banovina|Morava]], [[Zeta Banovina|Zeta]] and [[Vardar Banovina|Vardar]].{{sfn|Vucinich|Tomasevich|1969|p=31}} The Banovina of Croatia included a notable Serb population, while the Serbian Banovina would similarly include a notable non-Slavic population.{{sfn|Matica srpska|1999|p=134}} The plans were affirmed in the February 1940 number of ''Glas''.{{sfn|Matica srpska|1999|p=134}} It was stated that apart from the Banovina of Croatia, only the Serbian Banovina and Banovina of Slovenia had the right to exist.{{sfn|Matica srpska|1999|p=134}} The organization of the proposed banovina was supposed to be similar to that of Croatia.{{sfn|Vucinich|Tomasevich|1969|p=31}}

==Demographics==
According to 1931 Yugoslav census, the existing banovinas that, according to the proposal, would be included into the Banovina of Serbia had the following population:
* [[Vrbas Banovina]]: 1,037,382, of which 600,529 (58%) [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christians]]
* [[Drina Banovina]]: 1,534,739, of which 992,924 (65%) Orthodox Christians
* [[Danube Banovina]]: 2,387,295, of which 1,393,269 (58%) Orthodox Christians
* [[Morava Banovina]]: 1,435,584, of which 1,364,490 (95%) Orthodox Christians
* [[Zeta Banovina]]: 925,516, of which 516,490 (56%) Orthodox Christians
* [[Vardar Banovina]]: 1,574,243, of which 1,046,039 (66%) Orthodox Christians

The '''Bassa Friulana''' is a low-lying and level area of [[Friuli]], specifically the very southern part of the provincies of [[province of Pordenone|Pordenone]], [[province of Udine|Udine]] and [[province of Gorizia|Gorizia]] in the north-eastern Italian region of [[Friuli-Venezia Giulia]].

It is well known for its beaches (such as those of [[Grado, Italy|Grado]], [[Grado Pineta]], [[Lignano Sabbiadoro]], [[Lignano Pineta]] and [[Lignano Riviera]]), and for its lagoons (such as those of [[Grado Lagoon|Grado]] and [[Marano Lagunare]]). There is a unique example of [[industrial archaeology]] at [[Torviscosa]]. [[Palmanova]] is a small renaissance town shaped as a star. The  Roman and medieval  town of [[Aquileia]] is of great historical importance. [[Monfalcone]] has important shipyards.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2023">[[File:Bassin Bleu, Haiti.jpg|thumb|right|One of the pools of Bassin Bleu, May 2013]] 
'''Bassin Bleu''' ({{lang-ht|Basenblé}} ; Blue Basin) is a natural water site located west of the city of [[Jacmel]], in the [[Sud-Est (department)|Sud-Est]] [[Departments of Haiti|department]] of Haiti. It is a series of three pools along the [[Petite Rivière de Jacmel]].&lt;ref name="Planet 2017"&gt;{{cite web | last=Planet | first=Lonely | title=Bassin Bleu in Jacmel, Haiti | website=Lonely Planet | date=2017-06-23 | url=https://www.lonelyplanet.com/haiti/jacmel/attractions/bassin-bleu/a/poi-sig/1026256/358066 | access-date=2018-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Clammer 2016 p. 147"&gt;{{cite book | last=Clammer | first=P. | title=Haiti: | publisher=Bradt Travel Guides | series=Bradt Travel Guide. Haiti | year=2016 | isbn=978-1-84162-923-0 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e6AyDQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA147 | language=fr | access-date=2018-06-04 | page=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Access==
To access the site, you need to go in the direction of [[La Vallée-de-Jacmel]], and then Bassin-Bleu. From the village of Bassin-Bleu, the road to the site is up.

Access is not very difficult with a four-wheel drive vehicle. It is a winding road in the mountains allowing access to the site. Getting into the best open part and for diving from several levels requires about a 20 minute hike, then roping down a 12 ft rock face. Locals are often present for guidance and steadying. As of 2017, generally each person pays an "optional" contribution at the tourism office, then one can walk there independently or hire a local guide for a fee (about 100G per person). 

==Pools==
The site consists of three pools:
*Bassin Palmiste
*Bassin Bleu
*Bassin Clair

The latter is by far the most well-known with a cascade of {{convert|10|m|ft|1}} falling into a pool of turquoise water.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8889">'''Cape Parry''' is a [[headland]] in [[Canada]]'s [[Northwest Territories]]. Located at the northern tip of the [[Parry Peninsula]], it projects into [[Amundsen Gulf]]. The nearest settlement is [[Paulatuk]], {{convert|100|km|abbr=on}} to the south, and [[Fiji Island (Northwest Territories)|Fiji Island]] is located {{convert|9|km|abbr=on}} to the west. Cape Parry was formerly accessible through Cape Parry Airport that was located at the [[Distant Early Warning Line]]. The airport was listed as abandoned after the closure of the DEW line site.&lt;ref&gt;{{CFS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is named for the Arctic explorer [[William Edward Parry]].

==History==
Between the 1950s to the 1980s, a Distant Early Warning Line site (PIN-Main) was located south of Police Point, the cape's western point.&lt;ref name="PINmain"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lswilson.ca/pin-main.htm|title=Cape Parry NWT PIN-Main|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the period of 1969 to 1982, eighteen [[sounding rocket]] launches were made at Cape Parry.&lt;ref name="astronautix"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.astronautix.com/sites/capparry.htm|title=Cape Parry|accessdate=21 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Geography==
Cape Parry is a three pointed outcrop of coastal cliffs. The limestone formation rises {{convert|20|m|abbr=on}} [[above mean sea level|above sea level]]. The deeply incised coastal beaches are composed of sand and gravel, and form bays and inlets.&lt;ref name="NGPS" /&gt; On either side of the narrow isthmus that joins Cape Parry to the Parry Peninsula are Tyne Bay to the west and Gillet Bay to the east.&lt;ref name="PINmain" /&gt;

==Climate==
Absolute minimum temperature is {{Convert|-47.2|C}}, while absolute maximum temperature is {{Convert|23.9|C}}. Annual snowfall is {{convert|116.0|cm|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref name="ccn"/&gt; Although the manned [[weather station]] is no longer in operation there is an [[automatic weather station]] (CZCP) at the site.&lt;ref&gt;{{Can-arpt-wx|CZCP|Cape Parry}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Commonwealth Expedition''' or '''COMEX''' started in 1965 as an expedition from Britain to India in support of the multicultural ideals of the then called [[British Commonwealth]]. The idea was conceived by [[Lionel Gregory]], who attributes some of the ideas to conversations he had with [[Jawaharlal Nehru]]. Nehru invited young people "to organise a new consciousness in the Commonwealth through cultural and intellectual activities as well as common adventure." Nehru's death in 1964 led to the cancellation of the project, but at the invitation of the Government of India, an expedition of  
204 young people set out from London on 30 July 1965. This was Comex 1.

In India the five contingents visited different regions - then known as Calcutta, Madras, Bombay, Rajasthan and Lucknow. They all met up again in Simla - staying at the Vice-Regal Lodge and performing at the Gaiety Theatre.

Comex1 came under the patronage of H.R.H. The Duke of Edinburgh.  The young participants had been trained by the RAF Regiment to be competent drivers, navigators, and radio operators.  They traveled overland in five buses via Europe and the Middle East conducting a programme of cultural exchange in the capital of each country visited, arriving in India on 30 August 1965.

The journey was not easy. There were barely roads through the searingly hot desert approaching Pakistan. Shortly after entering India, war broke out between India and Pakistan.  Buses, driving at night had to observe a strict black-out. The experience had a huge impact on all who took part and on those they met.  In the days before 'gap years' and cheap travel, the journey gave those who took part an unusual combination of responsibility, enjoyment, challenge and reward.

A reunion on 17 and 18 October 2015 – 50 years after the first Comex  took  place at the High Commission of India's Nehru Centre. As many of those who joined the first expedition and who could be contacted were invited. Eighty people out of the original participants came to the event and shared their memories, photographs keepsakes found in innumerable lofts. A souvenir brochure was produced with the help of Massey Ferguson who had sponsored the 1965 expedition and were honoured guests at the reunion.

The history of Comex is outlined in several books by its founder and leader, Lionel Gregory OBE. They include ''Crying Drums'',&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Lionel. ''Crying Drums: The Story of the Commonwealth Expedition''. London: Allen and Unwin, 1972.&lt;/ref&gt; ''With a Song and not a Sword'',
&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Lionel. ''With a Song and Not a Sword''. London: COMEX, 1973&lt;/ref&gt; ''Together, Unafraid'',&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Lionel. ''Together Unafraid''. London: Hale, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt; and ''Journey of a Lifetime''.&lt;ref&gt;Gregory, Lionel. ''Journey of a Lifetime''. Plymouth: Northcote House, 1997.&lt;/ref&gt;

The model has been followed subsequently at regular intervals, for a total of 14 expeditions, overland across the [[Asian Highway]], within India itself, and into [[Africa]], with [[Zambia]] serving as a base.

{{Politics of Iceland}}

[[Iceland]] was historically divided into 23 [[County|counties]], ''sýslur'' and 23 independent towns, ''kaupstaðir''. Iceland is now split up between 24 [[sýslumaður|sýslumenn]] (magistrates) that are the highest authority over the local [[police]] (except in [[Reykjavík]] where there is a special office of police commissioner) and carry out administrative functions such as declaring [[bankruptcy]] and [[marriage|marrying]] people outside of the church. The jurisdictions of these magistrates often follow the lines of the historical counties but not always. When speaking of these new "administrative" counties the custom is to associate them with the county seats rather than using the names of the traditional counties, even when they cover the same area.

==Composition==
Independent towns (''kaupstaðir'') were first created in the 18th century as urbanisation began in Iceland, this practice continued into the 1980s the last town that was declared an independent town was [[Ólafsvík]] in 1983. Since then, the laws regarding [[Municipalities of Iceland|municipalities]] have been changed in such a way that there is no longer any distinction made between urban or rural municipalities.

===Historical counties===
The historical counties were:

*[[Árnessýsla]]
*[[Austur-Barðastrandarsýsla]]
*[[Austur-Húnavatnssýsla]]
*[[Austur-Skaftafellssýsla]]
*[[Borgarfjarðarsýsla]]
*[[Dalasýsla]]
*[[Eyjafjarðarsýsla]]
*[[Gullbringusýsla]]
*[[Kjósarsýsla]]
*[[Mýrasýsla]]

The [[Anglican]] [[diocese]] of '''North East Caribbean and Aruba''' was formed in 1842 as the '''Diocese of Antigua and the Leeward Islands''' when the [[Anglican diocese of Barbados]], then with the [[Diocese of Jamaica]] one of the two dioceses covering the Caribbean, was sub-divided. It celebrated its 175th birthday in 2017.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglican.ink/article/caribbean-diocese-mark-175th-anniversary Anglican (ink)]&lt;/ref&gt;

It is now one of the 8 dioceses within the [[Church in the Province of the West Indies|Province of the West Indies]] and comprises the 12 islands of [[Antigua]], [[Barbuda]], [[Dominica]], [[Montserrat]], [[Anguilla]], [[Aruba]], [[Nevis]], [[Saba]], [[Saint Barthélemy|St. Barts]], [[St. Eustatius]], [[St. Kitts]], and [[Saint Martin|St. Martin/St. Maarten]]. The diocesan cathedral is [[St. John's Cathedral (Antigua and Barbuda)|St John's Cathedral]] in St John's Antigua.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.anglicancommunion.org/structures/member-churches/member-church/diocese.aspx?church=west-indies&amp;dio=north-eastern-caribbean-aruba Anglican Communion]&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also a Catholic diocese covering a similar area, the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Saint John's – Basseterre]]

The diocese was under the jurisdiction of the Archbishop of Canterbury from its creation in 1842 until 1883, when the Province of the West Indies was created. Initially the Established Church of the area, and thus supported by public funds, it was disestablished in 1969.

'''''Endurance''''' was the three-masted [[barquentine]] in which Sir [[Ernest Shackleton]] sailed for the [[Antarctic]] on the 1914 [[Imperial Trans-Antarctic Expedition]]. She was launched in 1912 from [[Sandefjord]] in [[Norway]] and was crushed by ice, causing her to sink three years later in the [[Weddell Sea]] off [[Antarctica]].

== Design and construction ==
Designed by [[Ole Aanderud Larsen]], ''Endurance'' was built at the [[Framnæs shipyard]] in [[Sandefjord]], [[Norway]] and fully completed on 17 December 1912. She was built under the supervision of master wood shipbuilder Christian Jacobsen, who was renowned for insisting that all men in his employment were not just skilled shipwrights but also be experienced in seafaring aboard whaling or sealing ships. Every detail of her construction had been scrupulously planned to ensure maximum durability: for example, every joint and fitting was cross-braced for maximum strength.

The ship was launched on 17 December 1912 and was initially christened ''Polaris'' (eponymous with [[Polaris]], the North Star). She was {{convert|144|ft}} long, with a {{convert|25|ft}} beam and measured 348 [[gross register tonnage|tons gross]].&lt;ref name = stamp/&gt; Her original purpose was as an ice-capable [[steam yacht]], to provide luxurious accommodation for small tourist and hunting parties in the [[Arctic]]. As launched she had 10 passenger cabins, a spacious dining saloon and galley (with accommodation for two cooks), a smoking room, a [[darkroom]] to allow passengers to develop photographs, electric lighting and even a small bathroom. 

Though her hull looked from the outside like that of any other vessel of a comparable size, it was not. She was designed for polar conditions with a very sturdy construction. Her keel members were four pieces of solid oak, one above the other, adding up to a thickness of {{convert|85|in}}, while its sides were between {{convert|30|in}} and {{convert|18|in}} thick, with twice as many frames as normal and the frames being of double thickness. She was built of planks of [[oak]] and Norwegian [[fir]] up to {{convert|30|in}} thick, sheathed in [[Chlorocardium rodiei|greenheart]], a notably strong and heavy wood. The bow, which would meet the ice head-on, had been given special attention. Each timber had been made from a single oak tree chosen for its shape so that its natural shape followed the curve of the ship's design. When put together, these pieces had a thickness of {{convert|52|in}}.
[[File:Endurance4.jpg|thumb|Shackleton looking overboard at ''Endurance'' being crushed by the ice]]
[[File:Endurance Final Sinking.jpg|thumb|''Endurance'' final sinking November 1915]]
Of her three [[Mast (sailing)|masts]], the forward one was [[square-rigged]], while the after two carried fore and aft sails, like a schooner. As well as sails, ''Endurance'' had a {{convert|350|HP}} coal-fired [[steam engine]] capable of speeds up to {{convert|10.2|kn}}.

By the time of launch on 17 December 1912, ''Endurance'' was perhaps the strongest wooden ship ever built, with the possible exception of ''[[Fram]]'', the vessel used by [[Fridtjof Nansen]] and later by [[Roald Amundsen]]. However, there was one major difference between the ships. ''Fram'' was bowl-bottomed, which meant that if the ice closed in against her it would be squeezed up and out and not be subject to the pressure of the ice compressing around her. By contrast ''Endurance'' was designed with great inherent strength in her hull to resist collision with ice floes and to break through pack ice by ramming and crushing. However she was not intended to be frozen into heavy pack ice, and so was not designed to rise out of a crush. In such a situation she was dependent on the ultimate strength of her hull alone.{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

== Ownership ==
As ''Endurance'' was built for [[Adrien de Gerlache]] and [[Lars Christensen]], they intended to use her for polar cruises for tourists to hunt [[polar bear]]s. Financial problems led to de Gerlache pulling out of their partnership, leaving Christensen unable to pay the Framnaes yard the final amounts to hand over and fit out the ship. For over a year Christensen attempted to sell the ship as her unique design as an ice-capable passenger-carrying ship, with relatively little space for stores and no cargo hold made her useless to the [[whaling]] industry. Meanwhile she was too big, slow and uncomfortable to be a private [[steam yacht]]. In the event Christensen was happy to sell the ship to [[Ernest Shackleton]] for GB£11,600, which represented a significant loss to him as it barely covered the outstanding payments to Framnaes, let alone the ship's total build costs. He is reported to have said he was happy to take the loss in order to further the plans of an explorer of Shackleton's stature {{ref|Lansing}}. After Shackleton purchased the ship, she was rechristened ''"Endurance"'' after the Shackleton family motto ''"Fortitudine vincimus"'' (By endurance we conquer).

Shackleton had the ship relocated from Norway to London. She arrived at the [[Millwall Dock]] in the spring of 1914 where she was refitted and modified for expedition purposes. She was stripped of most of her luxurious accommodation and fittings. This included removing many of the passenger cabins to make room for space for stores and equipment, while the crew cabins on the lower deck were removed and converted into a cargo hold - the reduced crew of sailors that Shackleton would take on the expedition would make their quarters in the cramped [[forecastle]]. The darkroom remained in its original location ahead of the boiler. The refit also saw the ship repainted from her original white paint to a more austere (and visible amongst ice) black, and features such as gilt scrollwork on the bow and stern, were painted over. Despite her change of name she retained a large badge in the shape of a five-pointed star on her stern, which originally symbolized her name after the [[pole star]]. 

Her new equipment included four [[Ship's boat|ship's boats]]. Two were 21-foot (6.4 meter) transom-built rowing cutters purchased secondhand from the whaling industry. The third was a larger 22.5-foot (6.85 meter) double-ended rowing [[whaleboat]] built for the expedition to specifications drawn up by [[Frank Worsley]], ''Endurance's'' new captain. The fourth was a smaller [[motorboat]]. 

After her refit she made the short coastal journey to [[Plymouth]].

In the previous 16 years, nearly two dozen wooden vessels had sailed to the icy seas of the far south. All had returned home but the [[SY Aurora|''Aurora'']]. Lloyd's of London and the Indemnity Marine Assurance Company had underwritten her hull, machinery and equipment for £15,000. Just before she sailed, ''The Times'' had reported that "Hitherto the insurance of vessels taking part in Antarctic exploration has ceased at the last port touched, and ''Endurance'' will be the first vessel to be insured in the ice zone."

The Times had praised ''Endurance'' as "built specially for work in Polar seas," adding that "in an ice-coated sea there can be no turbulent waves which are the causes of so many disasters in warmer zones."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Heacox|first=Kim|title=The Antarctic Challenge|year=1999|publisher=National Geographic|location=Washington, D.C.|isbn=978-0792275367|page=82}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Final voyage ==

''Endurance'' sailed from [[Plymouth]], England on 6 August 1914 and set course for [[Buenos Aires]], [[Argentina]]. Shackleton remained in Britain, finalising the expedition's organization and for some last-minute fundraising. This was ''Endurance's'' first major voyage following its completion and amounted to a shakedown voyage. The trip across the [[Atlantic]] took more than two months. Built for the ice, her hull was considered by many of her crew too rounded for the open ocean. Shackleton took a steamer to Buenos Aires and caught up with his expedition a few days after ''Endurance's'' arrival.

On October 26, 1914 ''Endurance'' sailed from Buenos Aires to what would be her last port of call, the [[whaling]] station at [[Grytviken]] on the island of [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], arriving on November 5. She left [[Grytviken]] on 5 December 1914 heading for the southern regions of the [[Weddell Sea]].

Two days after leaving from [[South Georgia Island|South Georgia]], ''Endurance'' encountered polar pack ice and progress slowed down. For weeks ''Endurance'' worked its way through the pack, averaging less than {{convert|30|mi}} per day. By 15 January 1915 ''Endurance'' was within {{convert|200|mi}} of her destination, [[Vahsel Bay]]. However, by the following day, heavy pack ice was sighted in the morning and in the afternoon a gale developed. Under these conditions it was soon evident progress could not be made, and ''Endurance'' took shelter under the lee of a large grounded berg. During the next two days, ''Endurance'' moved back and forth under the sheltering protection of the berg.

On 18 January the gale began to moderate and ''Endurance'' set the topsail with the engine at slow. The pack had blown away. Progress was made slowly until hours later ''Endurance'' encountered the pack once more. It was decided to move forward and work through the pack, and at 5:00 pm  ''Endurance'' entered it. However, it was noticed that this ice was different from what had been encountered before. The ship was soon amongst thick but soft brash ice. The ship became beset. The gale now increased in intensity and kept blowing for another six days from a northerly direction towards land. By 24 January, the wind had completely compressed the ice in the whole [[Weddell Sea]] against the land. ''Endurance'' was icebound. All that could be done was to wait for a southerly gale that would start pushing, decompressing and opening the ice in the other direction. Instead, the days passed and the pack remained unchanged.

''Endurance'' drifted for months beset in the ice in the Weddell Sea. The changing conditions of the Antarctic spring brought such pressure that broke the hull of ''Endurance'' over the period from 27 October 1915, causing flooding of interior spaces. On the morning of 21 November 1915, ''Endurance'''s superstructure began to break and her timbers began snapping  and thus she had to be abandoned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/History/Ernest_Shackleton_map_time_line.htm|title=Ernest Shackleton, Endurance Voyage, Time Line and Map
|publisher=CoolAntarctica.com |year= 2001|accessdate=2012-10-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The crew remained on the ice for several more weeks, and when the ice pack broke up they used ''Endurance'''s three lifeboats to reach Elephant Island. Twenty-two men waited while Shackleton and five others took the largest of the lifeboats, ''[[Voyage of the James Caird|James Caird]]'', and sailed to [[South Georgia and the South Sandwich Islands#South Georgia|South Georgia]] to obtain rescue for the rest of the crew. Shackleton arrived at the whaling station on South Georgia Island two weeks later, but because the whaling ships were not equipped to penetrate Antarctic sea ice it took Shackleton three months before he successfully approached [[Elephant Island]] in August 1916 and rescued the rest of his crew on his third attempted rescue mission.{{citation needed|date=June 2016}}

'''Nationalities.'''
All the crew were born and resident in England before the expedition, except for the following:
* Shackleton. Irish
* Worsley. New Zealander.
* Greenstreet. New Zealander.
* Crean. Irish.
* Macklin. Indian
* McIlroy. Irish
* Wordie. Scottish.
* Hurley. Australian.
* Clark. Scottish.
* McNish. Scottish.
* Bakewell. American, may have claimed to be Canadian when he applied to join the ''Imperial'' expedition in Buenos Aires.
* McCarthy. Irish.
* Blackborrow. Welsh.
* Edgar Smith. Irish.
* McCarthy. Irish.
* Green. British
Blackborrow was originally refused a post aboard the vessel due to his young age and inexperience and decided to stow away, helped to sneak aboard by William Bakewell, a friend of his, and Walter How. When he was found Shackleton decided to make him a steward rather than leave him ashore at South Georgia. Blackborrow eventually proved his worth, earning the Bronze Polar Medal, and the honour of becoming the first human being ever to set foot on Elephant Island. His name is also the matter of some debate—it is sometimes spelled Percy, or Blackboro, or in other ways.

== Supposed advertisement ==
It is often said that Shackleton placed an advertisement in a newspaper reading:
{{quote | Men wanted for hazardous journey. Small wages, bitter cold, long months of complete darkness, constant danger, safe return doubtful. Honour and recognition in case of success. Sir Ernest Shackleton.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url = http://content.time.com/time/specials/packages/article/0,28804,1981290_1981354,00.html | title = The Greatest Adventures of All Time&amp;nbsp;— The Great Survivor | publisher = TIME | date = 2003-09-12 | accessdate = 2011-03-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
No trace of the supposed advertisement has come to light.

== Modern history ==
[[Alfred Lansing]] wrote a book titled ''[[Endurance: Shackleton's Incredible Voyage]]'' about the ordeal that Shackleton and his men endured aboard the ship. It became a bestseller when first published in 1959. 

Two [[Antarctic]] patrol ships of the [[British Royal Navy]] have been named ''Endurance'' in honour of Shackleton's ship.  The first {{HMS|Endurance|1967|6}}, launched in May 1956 and awarded pennant number A171 sometime later, acted as an ice patrol and [[Hydrography|hydrographic]] survey ship until 1986.  The second {{HMS|Endurance|A171|6}} was bought from [[Norway]] in 1992 where she was named MV ''Polar Circle''.  She suffered severe flooding in 2008 due to procedural errors during maintenance and despite being returned to the UK was not repaired prior to being scrapped in 2016.

On 8 February 2017, an episode of the preeminent Australian fact-based comedy podcast ''Do Go On'' was released wherein the details of ''Endurance''{{'}}s final voyage were discussed at great length. The discussion was helmed by David J. Warneke with Jess "Bop" Perkins and Matt Stewart also in attendance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://itunes.apple.com/au/podcast/do-go-on/id1057458646?mt=2|title=iTunes podcast}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The wreck ==
In 1998, wreckage found at Stinker Point on the south western side of [[Elephant Island]] was incorrectly identified as [[Flotsam and jetsam|flotsam]] from the ship. However, it belonged to the 1877 wreck of the Connecticut sealing ship ''Charles Shearer''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.lonelyplanet.com/shop_pickandmix/previews/antarctica-4-south-shetland-islands-preview.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-04-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121011125434/http://www.lonelyplanet.com/shop_pickandmix/previews/antarctica-4-south-shetland-islands-preview.pdf |archivedate=2012-10-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 2001, wreck hunter [[David Mearns]] unsuccessfully planned an expedition to find the wreck of ''Endurance''.&lt;ref name="outsideonline.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://outsideonline.com/outside/news/200312/200312_rush.html |title=Endurance Rush |publisher=OutsideOnline.com |date=1915-11-21 |accessdate=2011-03-27 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100920212117/http://outsideonline.com/outside/news/200312/200312_rush.html |archivedate=2010-09-20 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  By 2003, two rival groups were making plans for an expedition to find the wreck;&lt;ref name="outsideonline.com"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.coolantarctica.com/Antarctica%20fact%20file/History/antarctic_ships/endurance.htm |title=Endurance, Ships of the Antarctic explorers |publisher=Coolantarctica.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; however no expedition was actually mounted. In 2010, Mearns announced a new plan to search for the wreck. The plan is sponsored by the [[National Geographic Society]] but is subject to finding sponsorship for the balance of the US$10 million estimated cost.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.smh.com.au/national/shackletons-ship-ultimate-challenge-20100115-mch2.html |title=Shackleton's ship 'ultimate challenge' |publisher=[[Sydney Morning Herald]] |date= January 16, 2010|accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bluewater.uk.com/bluewater-recoveries.htm |title=Blue Water Recoveries are a deep sea shipwreck recovery company |publisher=Bluewater.uk.com |date= |accessdate=2011-03-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A 2013 study by Dr Adrian Glover of the [[Natural History Museum, London]] suggests the [[Antarctic Circumpolar Current]] could preserve the wreck on the seabed by keeping wood-boring "ship worms" away.&lt;ref name=jon&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-23682521|title=Antarctic: Where 'zombies' thrive and shipwrecks are preserved|author=Jonathan Amos|work==BBC News|date=14 August 2013|accessdate=14 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''High Resolution Wide Swath''' (HRWS) imaging is an important branch in [[Synthetic aperture radar]] (SAR) imaging, a remote sensing technique capable of providing high resolution images independent of weather conditions and sunlight illumination. This makes SAR very attractive for the systematic observation of dynamic processes on the Earth's surface, which is useful for environmental monitoring, earth resource mapping and military systems.

SAR technology has provided terrain structural information to geologists for mineral exploration,&lt;ref&gt;Ramadan T M, Onsi H M.

Conventional SAR systems are limited in that a wide swath can only be achieved at the expense of a degraded [[azimuth]] resolution. Since wide coverage swaths and high resolution output are both important, this poses challenges and contradicting requirements on the design of space-borne SAR systems and related new algorithms.

== Problem statement and basics ==
===Problem statement===
State-of-the-art high-resolution SAR systems are rather limited with regarding to their acquisition capability.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}
[[File:Table1.tif|thumb|Requirements for spaceborne SAR]] 
An example is [[TerraSAR-X]], which is a German Earth-Observation satellite.  Its major payload is an X-band (3.1&amp;nbsp;cm) radar sensor, with different modes of operation, which allows it to provide multiple imaging modes for recording images with different swath width, resolution and polarizations, see the figure for more details. In stripmap mode (spatial resolution of 3m), it needs 10 weeks to map global Earth's landmass. This limitation also posed a challenge in the design of the [[TanDEM-X]], which is the twin satellite of TerraSAR-X.  Flying in close formation only a few hundred metres apart, the two satellites are imaging the terrain below them simultaneously but from different angles. It requires one year to achieve one global interferometric acquisition of the Earth's landmass for TanDEM-X.

To overcome this, some scientists propose Tandem-L mission, which is a prominent example.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dlr.de/hr/en/Portaldata/32/Resources/dokumente/broschueren/Tandem-L_web_Broschuere2014_en.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; The Tandem-L mission concept is based on the use of two satellites that operate in L-band (24&amp;nbsp;cm wavelength), which has much longer wavelength compared to X-band. Longer wavelength allows it to fulfills the requirements for a tomographic measurement of the three-dimensional structure of vegetation and ice regions, also for large scale surveying of deformations with millimeter accuracy.

The future SAR missions may require a mapping capability one or even two orders of magnitude better than that of Tandem-L, whose goal is the investigation of dynamic processes on the Earth's surface. For this, an extremely powerful SAR instrument is required, capable of mapping the whole Earth's surface twice per week, in full polarization and with a spatial resolution well below 10 m.  On the other hand, some other missions requires a much higher spatial resolution.

===Basics===
Given a single satellite, frequent and seamless coverage can only be achieved if a wide swath is imaged.

The swath width constrains the pulse repetition interval (PRI) or equivalently pulse repetition frequency (PRF), which equals to 1/PRI in the following way.

If the SAR sensor flying with speed &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt;, and there are two targets '''P''' and '''Q''' on the ground, the azimuth angle is calculated as &lt;math&gt;\Delta \phi = \phi P - \phi Q&lt;/math&gt;. For small bandwidth SARs, the usual linear relation between azimuth frequency and angle with wavelength &lt;math&gt;\lambda&lt;/math&gt; is described as follows:

&lt;math&gt;P R F = ( - 2 v / \lambda ) * sin \phi = ( - 2 v / \lambda ) * \phi&lt;/math&gt;

In order to optimize performance and control the range of ambiguities, the PRI must be larger than the time that it takes to collect returns from the entire illuminated swath. However, on the other hand, to avoid huge azimuth ambiguity levels, a large PRI implies the adoption of a small Doppler bandwidth and constrains the achievable azimuth resolution.&lt;ref&gt;Guarnieri A M. Adaptive removal of azimuth ambiguities in SAR images[J]. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 2005, 43(3): 625-633.&lt;/ref&gt;

==ScanSAR With multiple azimuth channels==
 
One example is the combination of displaced phase centers in azimuth with the low resolution [[COSMO-SkyMed#SAR Capabilities|ScanSAR]] or terrain observation by progressive scans (TOPS) mode.&lt;ref&gt;Gebert, Nicolas, Gerhard Krieger, and Alberto Moreira. "Multichannel azimuth processing in ScanSAR and TOPS mode operation." IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing 48.7 (2010): 2994-3008.&lt;/ref&gt;

As in classical ScanSAR,&lt;ref&gt;Tomiyasu K. Conceptual performance of a satellite borne, wide swath synthetic aperture radar[J]. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 1981 (2): 108-116.&lt;/ref&gt; azimuth bursts are used to map several swaths. Innovative operation of multichannel SAR systems in burst modes is shown in the second image, where multichannel configurations with a single transmit ("Tx") antenna and several receiving ("Rx") antennas are considered, Tx and Rx can be realized on separate platforms as well as separately on the same platform or even integrated in the same antenna by transmit-and-receive (T/R) module technology.

One of the key steps is multichannel azimuth processing. A multichannel SAR in azimuth can be interpreted as a linear system of filter functions which characterize the individual apertures’ impulse responses in amplitude and phase in dependence on the Doppler frequency &lt;math&gt;f&lt;/math&gt;.  A general system model is shown in the left.

&lt;math&gt;U_s(f)&lt;/math&gt; characterizes the scene, while &lt;math&gt;H_s(f)&lt;/math&gt; is the azimuth impulse response of a single-aperture system, yielding&lt;math&gt;U(f)&lt;/math&gt;which gives the equivalent monostatic SAR signal. The functions &lt;math&gt;H_s(f)&lt;/math&gt; represent the channel between the transmitter (Tx) and each receiver&lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; (Rx &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;) with respect to the monostatic impulse response, resulting in the respective multichannel SAR signal&lt;math&gt;U_j(f)&lt;/math&gt;. Assuming a single transmitter and several receiver channels, the physical along-track distance between Rx &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;  and &lt;math&gt;T_x&lt;/math&gt; is given by Δx, while λ represents the carrier wavelength, &lt;math&gt;R_0&lt;/math&gt; represents the slant range, and&lt;math&gt;v_s&lt;/math&gt; and&lt;math&gt;v_g&lt;/math&gt;represent the velocities of the sensor and the beam on ground, respectively.

After reception, each signal is sampled in azimuth by the PRF, and hence, the maximum signal bandwidth is N⋅PRF according to the effective sampling rate. A compact characterization of the whole system is then given by the matrix &lt;math&gt;H(f)&lt;/math&gt;, where one should note the dependence on the parameter PRF.

According to a generalized sampling theorem, N independent representations of a signal, each subsampled at 1/N of the signal's Nyquist frequency, allow for the unambiguous "reconstruction" of the original signal from the aliased Doppler spectra of the N representations. This means that any bandlimited signal &lt;math&gt;U(f&lt;/math&gt; is uniquely determined in terms of the responses &lt;math&gt;U_j(f)&lt;/math&gt; or, equivalently, by the respective functions &lt;math&gt;H_j(f)&lt;/math&gt;. This is valid independently of the spatial sample distribution as long as the samples do not coincide in space. Then, the inversion of &lt;math&gt;H(f)&lt;/math&gt; yields a matrix &lt;math&gt;P(f)&lt;/math&gt;that contains in its rows N functions &lt;math&gt;P_j(f)&lt;/math&gt; each representing the filter for the multichannel processing of channel &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;P(f) = H^{-1} (f)&lt;/math&gt;

The original signal &lt;math&gt;U(f)&lt;/math&gt; is then recovered by filtering each channel &lt;math&gt;j&lt;/math&gt; with its appropriate "reconstruction" filter &lt;math&gt;P_j(f)&lt;/math&gt; and subsequent coherent combination of all weighted receiver channels.The associated resolution loss from sharing the synthetic aperture among different swaths is compensated by collecting radar echoes with multiple displaced azimuth apertures.

A possible drawback of multichannel ScanSAR or TOPS approaches is the rather high Doppler centroid,&lt;ref&gt;Cafforio C, Guccione P, Guarnieri A M. Doppler centroid estimation for ScanSAR data[J]. IEEE transactions on geoscience and remote sensing, 2004, 42(1): 14-23.&lt;/ref&gt; which is one of the most important parameters need to be estimated in computing SAR images. For some of the imaged targets, in case high resolution is desired. Moreover, high [[Squint (antenna)|squint]] angles may also challenge co-registration in interferometric applications.

== Single-channel SAR with multiple elevation beams==
Besides multichannel ScanSAR, concepts based on the simultaneous recording of echoes of different pulses, transmitted by a wide beam illuminator and coming from different directions, are of great interest.&lt;ref&gt;Krieger, Gerhard, et al. "Advanced concepts for ultra-wide-swath SAR imaging." Proceedings of the European Conference on Synthetic Aperture Radar (EUSAR). Vol. 2. VDE, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Schematic of a multi-channel receiver.tif|thumb|Schematic of a multichannel receiver. The signal from each subaperture element is independently amplified, down converted,and digitized. The digital processing enables flexible and adaptive beamforming a posteriori to signal reception.(A/D) is analog to digital converter]]

Because it has following benefits: Multiple apertures that are displaced in along-track can acquire additional samples along the synthetic aperture and meanwhile they enable an efficient suppression of azimuth ambiguities. Moreover, by controlling a highly directive receiver beam following the radar pulse as it travels on the ground, multiple channels in elevation can improve the SNR (signal noise ratio) without reducing the swath width. Also, advanced multi-channel SAR architectures can avoid the use of separate Tx and Rx antennas and enable an increase of the coverage area without the necessity to either lengthen the antenna or employ burst modes.

To achieve these benefits, the receiving antenna usually is split into multiple sub-apertures, and each is connected to its individual receiver channels.  Then, the digitally recorded sub-aperture signals are combined in a spatiotemporal processor to simultaneously form multiple independent beams and to gather additional information about the direction of the scattered radar echoes.

An alternative to a planar array is a reflector antenna in combination with a digital feed array, which is of special interest for low frequency radar systems operating in L- and P-band (1 m),&lt;ref&gt;http://www.alternatewars.com/BBOW/Radar/Radar_Bands_Wavelengths.htm&lt;/ref&gt; combines the capabilities of digital beamforming with the high directivity of a large reflector antenna.

The reflector based architecture offers the potential to use all array elements simultaneously for the transmission of a broad beam without spill-over as desired for wide swath illumination.

For a paraboloidal reflector with a feed array close to the focal point, the signals which come from a given direction, usually correspond to only one or a very small subset of activated feed elements. And this property could reduce the implementation complexity and the costs of a digital beamforming radar.

However, this method also has its drawback that is the presence of blind ranges across the swath, as the radar cannot receive while it is transmitting.

==Digital beamforming with reflector antenna==

An interesting alternative to a planar antenna is a reflector, fed by a multichannel array. A parabolic reflector focuses an arriving plane wave on one or a small subset of feed elements. As the swath echoes arrive as plane waves from increasing look angles, one needs hence to only read out one feed element after the other to steer a high-gain beam in concert with the arriving echoes. A drawback of the multi-beam mode is the presence of blind ranges across the swath, as the radar cannot receive while it is transmitting.&lt;ref&gt;Gebert N, Krieger G, Moreira A. High Resolution Wide Swath SAR Imaging with Digital Beamforming–Performance Analysis, Optimization, System Design[J]. EUSAR 2006, 2006.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krieger, Gerhard, Nicolas Gebert, and Alberto Moreira. "Multidimensional waveform encoding: A new digital beamforming technique for synthetic aperture radar remote sensing." IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing 46.1 (2008): 31-46.&lt;/ref&gt;

Several innovative techniques using multiple receive apertures (‘Rx’) have been suggested to overcome the inherent limitations of conventional SAR to perform HRWS imaging. For optimum performance the relation between sensor velocity &lt;math&gt;v&lt;/math&gt; and the along-track offsets &lt;math&gt;\Delta x&lt;/math&gt; of the &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; sub-apertures has to result in equally spaced effective phase centers thus leading to a uniform sampling of the received signal. This requires that optimal PRF equals to&lt;math&gt;2 v / N \Delta x&lt;/math&gt;.

If a non-optimum PRF is chosen, the gathered samples are spaced non-uniformly. This requires a further processing step after down-conversion and quantization of the multi-aperture azimuth signal before conventional monostatic algorithms (such as the Range Doppler Algorithm (RDA)&lt;ref&gt;Wu C, Jin M. Modeling and a correlation algorithm for spaceborne SAR signals[J]. IEEE Transactions on Aerospace and Electronic Systems, 1982 (5): 563-575.&lt;/ref&gt; and Chirp Scaling Algorithm (CSA)&lt;ref&gt;Raney R K, Runge H, Bamler R, et al. Precision SAR processing using chirp scaling[J]. IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing, 1994, 32(4): 786-799.&lt;/ref&gt;) can be applied. For this, the individual aperture signals are regarded as independent Rx channels (See lower figure,A/D stands for Analog to Digital Converter). The purpose of the azimuth processing is to combine &lt;math&gt;N&lt;/math&gt; channels, each has a bandwidth of &lt;math&gt;N * P R F&lt;/math&gt;,  sub-sampled with &lt;math&gt;PRF&lt;/math&gt; to obtain a signal effectively sampled with &lt;math&gt;N*PRF = PRF_{eff}&lt;/math&gt;, which achieve Nyquist criterion by averaging after the processing. So the output signal is free of aliasing in the optimum case.

== Staggered-SAR==

As stated in the previous section, that for multi-beam modes, it has a disadvantage which is the presence of blind ranges across the swath, as the radar cannot receive while it is transmitting.  The staggered-SAR&lt;ref&gt;Villano, Michelangelo, Gerhard Krieger, and Alberto Moreira. "Staggered SAR: High-resolution wide-swath imaging by continuous PRI variation." IEEE Transactions on Geoscience and Remote Sensing 52.7 (2014): 4462-4479.&lt;/ref&gt; can overcome this drawback by continuously varying the ''PRI'' in a cyclic manner, therefore allowing the imaging of a wide continuous swath without the need for a long antenna with multiple apertures.

Why this will work? Because in satellite SAR imaging, antenna length and required azimuth resolution set an upper bound to the selected ''PRI''. The ''PRI'', in turn, will limit the maximum continuous swath width in slant range, which is only slightly influenced by the uncompressed transmitted pulse length &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; . The continuous time interval that the radar echo can be received is upper bounded by the time interval between the end of a transmitted pulse and the beginning of next one, say &lt;math&gt;PRI - \tau&lt;/math&gt;. However, when the radar is transmitting, the device cannot receive radar echo, thus the radar can only receive a signal from targets that are included within &lt;math&gt;PRI - 2 \tau&lt;/math&gt;. The difference between these two time intervals &lt;math&gt;\tau&lt;/math&gt; causes the blind range area which is given by &lt;math&gt;c_0 * \tau&lt;/math&gt;, where &lt;math&gt;c_0&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of light in free space.

If the ''PRI'' is uniform, blind ranges will remain unchanged along azimuth, and after compression in azimuth, the image would have blind strips of width &lt;math&gt;c_0 * \tau&lt;/math&gt;.If the ''PRI'' varies, although, the blind ranges still exist, but the position of these blind ranges also vary and will be different for each transmitted pulse, because transmitted pulse are only related to the preceding transmitted pulses. So when the overall synthetic aperture is taken into consideration, it turns out that at each slant range, only some of the transmitted pulses are missing, thus it is possible to obtain a SAR image over a wide continuous swath.  The figure on the right shows the location of blind range of both fixed ''PRI'' and varied ''PRI''.

The '''International Ice Patrol''' is an organization with the purpose of monitoring the presence of [[iceberg]]s in the [[Atlantic Ocean|Atlantic]] and [[Arctic Ocean]]s and reporting their movements for safety purposes. It is operated by [[United States Coast Guard]] but is funded by the 13 nations interested in trans-Atlantic navigation. As of 2011 the governments contributing to the International Ice Patrol include [[Belgium]], [[Canada]], [[Denmark]], [[Finland]], [[France]], [[Germany]], [[Greece]], [[Italy]], [[Japan]], the [[Netherlands]], [[Norway]], [[Panama]], [[Poland]], [[Spain]], [[Sweden]], the [[United Kingdom]], and the [[United States|United States of America]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.navcen.uscg.gov/pdf/iip/2011_IIP_Annual_Report.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The organization was established in 1914 in response to the [[sinking of the RMS Titanic|sinking of the RMS ''Titanic'']]. The primary mission of the Ice Patrol is to alert any seacraft traveling the [[great circle]] shipping lanes between Europe and the major ports of the United States and Canada of the presence of any icebergs there. &lt;ref&gt;A.J. Panian. "Yough graduate steps into titanic role".

==History==
=== Founding ===
From the earliest journeys into the [[North Atlantic]], icebergs have threatened vessels. A review of the history of navigation prior to the turn of the 20th century shows an impressive number of casualties occurred in the vicinity of the [[Grand Banks of Newfoundland]]. For example, [[Lady of the Lake (brig)|''Lady of the Lake'']] sank in 1833 with a loss of 215 people. Between 1882 and 1890, 14 vessels were lost and 40 seriously damaged due to ice. This does not include the large number of [[whaling]] and fishing vessels lost or damaged by ice. It took one of the greatest marine disasters of all time to arouse public demand for international cooperative action to deal with this marine hazard. This disaster, the sinking of the {{ship|RMS|Titanic}} on 15 April 1912, was the prime impetus for the establishment of the International Ice Patrol.

On her maiden voyage from [[Southampton, England]] bound for New York, ''Titanic'' collided with an iceberg just south of the tail of the Grand Banks and sank in less than three hours. The loss of life was enormous with more than 1,500 of the 2,224 passengers and crew perishing. ''Titanic'', the brand new ship of the [[White Star Line]], was the largest passenger liner of her time displacing 45,000 tons and capable of sustained speed in excess of {{convert|22|kn|km/h|0}}. Loss of ''Titanic'' gripped the world with a sobering awareness of an iceberg's potential for tragedy. The sheer dimensions of the ''Titanic'' disaster created sufficient public reaction on both sides of the Atlantic to prod reluctant governments into action, producing the first [[Safety of Life at Sea]] ([[International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea|SOLAS]]) convention in 1914. 

After the ''Titanic'' disaster, the U.S. Navy assigned the cruisers {{USS|Chester|CL-1|6|}} and {{USS|Birmingham|CL-2|6}} to patrol the Grand Banks of Newfoundland for the remainder of 1912. In 1913, the [[United States Navy|Navy]] could not spare ships for this purpose, so the [[Revenue Cutter Service]] (forerunner of the [[United States Coast Guard]]) assumed responsibility, assigning the [[USCGC Seneca (1908)|USRC ''Seneca'']] and [[USCGC Tampa (1912)|USRC ''Miami'']] to conduct the patrol.

At the first [[International Conference on the Safety of Life at Sea]], which was convened in [[London]] on 12 November 1913, the subject of patrolling the ice regions was thoroughly discussed. The convention signed on 30 January 1914, by the representatives of the world's various maritime powers, provided for the inauguration of an international derelict-destruction, ice observation, and ice patrol service, consisting of vessels, which should patrol the ice regions during the season of iceberg danger and attempt to keep the trans-Atlantic lanes clear of derelicts during the remainder of the year. Due primarily to the experience gained in 1912 and 1913, the United States Government was invited to undertake the management of the triple service, the expense to be defrayed by the 13 nations interested in trans-Atlantic navigation.

The second International Conference on Safety of Life at Sea was convened in London on 16 April 1929. Eighteen nations participated, all of which signed the final act on 31 May 1929. Because of the fear in the United States Senate as a result of ambiguities in Article 54 dealing with control, the 1929 convention was not ratified by the United States until 7 August 1936, and even then the ratification was accompanied by three reservations. At the same time, Congress enacted legislation on 25 June 1936, formally requiring the [[Commandant of the Coast Guard]] to administer the International Ice Observation and Ice Patrol Service (Chap. 807, para. 2 49 USC 1922) and describing in general fashion the manner in which this service was to be performed. With only minor changes, this remains today as the basic Coast Guard authority to operate the International Ice Patrol. Since 1929, there have been three SOLAS conventions (1948, 1960 &amp; 1974). None of these have recommended any basic change affecting the Ice Patrol.

Every year since 1914, the United States Coast Guard and the International Ice Patrol lay a wreath from a ship or an aircraft at the site of the ''Titanic'' disaster on 15 April. The solemn ceremony is attended by the craft's crew and a dedication statement to the ''Titanic'' and her lost passengers is read.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.boston.com/news/local/connecticut/articles/2011/04/15/uscg_marks_99th_anniversary_of_titanic_sinking/ "USCG Marks 99th Anniversary of Titanic Sinking"], boston.com,  Associated Press (New London, Connecticut), 15 April 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;From  Steamboat Inspection Service to U.S. Coast Guard: Marine Safety in the United States from 1838 - 1946.

=== Administration ===
From its inception until the beginning of World War II, the Ice Patrol was conducted from two surface patrol cutters alternating surveillance patrols of the southern ice limits. In 1931 and thereafter a third ship was assigned to Ice Patrol to perform oceanographic observations in the vicinity of the Grand Banks. After World War II, aerial surveillance became the primary ice reconnaissance method with surface patrols phased out except during unusually heavy ice years or extended periods of reduced visibility. Use of the oceanographic vessel continued until 1982, when the Coast Guard's sole remaining oceanographic ship, {{USCGC|Evergreen|WLB-295|6}}, was converted to a medium endurance cutter. The aircraft has distinct advantages for ice reconnaissance providing much greater coverage in a relatively short period of time.

From 1946 until 1966, the Ice Patrol offices, operations center and reconnaissance aircraft were based at the Coast Guard Air Detachment Argentia, [[Newfoundland and Labrador|Newfoundland]] during the ice season.

Due to changing operational commitments and financial constraints the Coast Guard Argentia Air Detachment closed in 1966. Ice Patrol headquarters and operations center moved to [[Governors Island, New York]]&lt;ref name="proceedings"&gt;Osmer, Stephen R., LTJG USCG "The Aerial Ice Patrol: No More ''Titanics''s" ''United States Naval Institute Proceedings'' March 1976 pp. 103-104&lt;/ref&gt; where they remained until October 1983. 

Today the International Ice Patrol is located at the Coast Guard Research and Development Center in [[New London, Connecticut]]. The ice reconnaissance detachment, usually composed of eleven aircrew and four ice observers flying in a [[HC-130]] aircraft, continues to work out of Newfoundland.

The Ice Patrol disseminates information on icebergs and the limit of all known sea ice via radio broadcast from the U.S. Coast Guard Communications Command (COMMCOM) located in Chesapeake, Virginia via Inmarsat Safetynet, and radio facsimile chart.  Ice Patrol information is also available via http Internet access. 2002 changes to SOLAS requires ships transiting the region guarded by the Ice Patrol to use the services provided during the ice season.

The name originates from the [[Hebrew]] name "Yehudah", a son of the Jewish patriarch Jacob/Israel, and Yehudah's progeny forming the biblical [[Israelite]] [[tribe of Judah]] (Yehudah) and later the associated [[Kingdom of Judah]], which the 1906 Jewish Encyclopedia dates from [[Rehoboam|934]] until [[Siege of Jerusalem (587 BC)|586 BCE]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/8955-judah-kingdom-of |title=Judah, Kingdom of |publisher=Jewish Encyclopedia |date= |accessdate=2014-04-10}}&lt;/ref&gt; The name of the region continued to be incorporated through the Babylonian conquest, [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian]], [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]], and [[Roman Empire|Roman periods]] as [[Yehud (Babylonian province)|Yehud]], [[Yehud Medinata]], [[Hasmonean Kingdom|Hasmonean]] Judea, and consequently [[Herodian Kingdom|Herodian]] Judea and [[Judea (Roman province)|Roman]] Judea, respectively.

As a consequence of the [[Bar Kokhba revolt]], in 135 CE the region was renamed and merged with [[Roman Syria]] to form ''[[Syria Palaestina]]'' by the victorious Roman Emperor [[Hadrian]]. A large part of Judea was included in Jordanian [[Jordanian annexation of the West Bank|West Bank]] between 1948 and 1967 (i.e., the "West Bank" of the Kingdom of Jordan).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Mark A.

==Etymology==
The name  ''Judea'' is a Greek and [[Latin (language)|Roman]] adaptation of the name "[[Tribe of Judah|Judah]]", which originally encompassed the territory of the [[Israelite]] tribe of that name and later of the ancient [[Kingdom of Judah]]. [[Nimrud Tablet K.3751]], dated c.733 BCE, is the earliest known record of the name Judah (written in [[Assyrian cuneiform]] as Yaudaya or KUR.ia-ú-da-a-a).

Judea was sometimes used as the name for the entire region, including parts [[Transjordan (region)|beyond the river Jordan]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3135423 Studies in Palestinian Geography, Prof. S.J. Riggs, Auburn Theological Seminary, 1894, JSTOR The Biblical World]&lt;/ref&gt; In 200 CE [[Sextus Julius Africanus]], cited by [[Eusebius of Caesarea|Eusebius]] (''Church History'' 1.7.14), described "Nazara" ([[Nazareth]]) as a village in Judea.&lt;ref&gt;"A few of the careful, however, having obtained private records of their own, either by remembering the names or by getting them in some other way from the registers, pride themselves on preserving the memory of their noble extraction. Among these are those already mentioned, called Desposyni, on account of their connection with the family of the Saviour.

==Historical boundaries==
[[Image:Judea 1 by David Shankbone.jpg|thumb|The [[Judean Mountains|Judean hills]]]]
[[File:Ruin of Itri, Israel.jpg|thumb|[[Hurvat Itri]] in Judea]]
The classical Roman-Jewish historian [[Josephus]] wrote (''[[The Jewish War|Wars]]'' 3.3.5): &lt;blockquote&gt;In the limits of Samaria and Judea lies the village [[As-Sawiya#Khan as-Sawiya (Khirbet Berkit)|Anuath, which is also named Borceos]].&lt;ref&gt;Based on [[Charles William Wilson]]'s (1836–1905) identification of this site, who thought that Borceos may have been a place about 18 kilometers to the south of Neapolis (Nablus) because of a name similarity (''Berkit''). See p. 232 in: {{cite book |author= Wilson, Charles William |authorlink= Charles William Wilson |title= Picturesque Palestine, Sinai and Egypt |url= https://archive.org/details/picturesquepales01wilsuoft |volume=1 |year=1881 |publisher= [[D. Appleton &amp; Company|D. Appleton]] |location=New York}}. This identification is the result of the equivocal nature of Josephus' statement, where he mentions both "Samaria" and "Judea." Samaria was a sub-district of Judea. Others speculate that ''Borceos'' may have referred to the village [[Burqin, Palestine|Burqin]], in northern Samaria, and which village marked the bounds of Judea to its north.&lt;/ref&gt; This is the northern boundary of Judea. The southern parts of Judea, if they be measured lengthways, are bounded by a village adjoining to the confines of [[Arabia]]; the [[Jews]] that dwell there call it Jordan. However, its breadth is extended from the river Jordan to Joppa. The city Jerusalem is situated in the very middle; on which account some have, with sagacity enough, called that city the Navel of the country. Nor indeed is Judea destitute of such delights as come from the sea, since its maritime places extend as far as Ptolemais: it was parted into eleven portions, of which the royal city [[Jerusalem]] was the supreme, and presided over all the neighboring country, as the head does over the body. As to the other cities that were inferior to it, they presided over their several [[toparchies]]; Gophna was the second of those cities, and next to that Acrabatta, after them Thamna, and [[Lod|Lydda]], and [[Emmaus]], and Pella, and [[Idumea]], and [[Ein Gedi|Engaddi]], and [[Herodium]], and [[Jericho]]; and after them came Jamnia and [[Jaffa|Joppa]], as presiding over the neighboring people; and besides these there was the region of Gamala, and Gaulonitis, and Batanea, and Trachonitis, which are also parts of the kingdom of Agrippa. This [last] country begins at Mount Libanus, and the fountains of Jordan, and reaches breadthways to the [[Sea of Galilee|lake of Tiberias]]; and in length is extended from a village called Arpha, as far as Julias. Its inhabitants are a mixture of Jews and Syrians. And thus have I, with all possible brevity, described the country of Judea, and those that lie round about it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/ancient/josephus-wara.html |title=Ancient History Sourcebook: Josephus (37 – after 93 CE): Galilee, Samaria, and Judea in the First Century CE |publisher=Fordham.edu |date= |accessdate=2012-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Geography==
[[Image:Valley of Elah-Med woodland.jpg|thumb|[[Mediterranean]] [[oak]] and [[Pistacia palaestina|terebinth]] [[woodland]] in the [[Valley of Elah]], southwestern Judea]]
Judea is a mountainous region, part of which is considered a [[desert]]. It varies greatly in height, rising to an altitude of 1,020&amp;nbsp;m (3,346&amp;nbsp;ft) in the south at [[Mount Hebron]], {{convert|30|km|mi|abbr=on}} southwest of [[Jerusalem]], and descending to as much as 400&amp;nbsp;m (1,312&amp;nbsp;ft) ''below'' sea level in the east of the region. It also varies in rainfall, starting with about {{convert|400|–|500|mm|in}} in the western hills, rising to {{convert|600|mm|in}} around western Jerusalem (in central Judea), falling back to {{convert|400|mm|in}} in eastern Jerusalem and dropping to around {{convert|100|mm|in}} in the eastern parts, due to a [[rainshadow effect]] (this is the Judean desert). The climate, accordingly, moves between [[Mediterranean climate|Mediterranean]] in the west and [[desert climate]] in the east, with a strip of [[steppe climate]] in the middle. Major urban areas in the region include Jerusalem, [[Bethlehem]], [[Gush Etzion]], Jericho and [[Hebron]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lifeintheholyland.com/picturesque_palestine_vol1.htm |title=Picturesque Palestine I: Jerusalem, Judah, Ephraim |publisher=Lifeintheholyland.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geographers divide Judea into several regions: the Hebron hills, the Jerusalem saddle, the [[Bethel]] hills and the Judean desert east of Jerusalem, which descends in a series of steps to the [[Dead Sea]]. The hills are distinct for their [[anticline]] structure. In ancient times the hills were forested, and the [[Bible]] records agriculture and sheep farming being practiced in the area. Animals are still grazed today, with shepherds moving them between the low ground to the hilltops as summer approaches, while the slopes are still layered with centuries-old stone [[Terrace (agriculture)|terracing]]. The Jewish Revolt against the Romans ended in the devastation of vast areas of the Judaean countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ansmagazine.com/Winter07/ |title=Unlikely A Tale of Two Conquests: The Unlikely Numismatic Association Between the Fall of New France (AD 1760) and the Fall of Judaea (AD 70) |publisher=Ansmagazine.com |date= |accessdate=2012-12-31 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120707042740/http://ansmagazine.com/Winter07/ |archivedate=2012-07-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Mount Hazor]] marks the geographical boundary between Samaria to its north and Judea to its south.

==History==

===Early Iron Age===
{{main|History of ancient Israel and Judah|Kingdom of Judah}}
[[File:Levant 830.svg|thumb|Map of the southern [[Levant]], c.830s BCE&lt;small&gt;{{legend|#00ff00|Kingdom of Judah}}&lt;/small&gt;]]
The early history of Judah is uncertain; the Biblical account states that the [[Kingdom of Judah]], along with the [[Kingdom of Israel (Samaria)|Northern Kingdom]], was a successor to a united [[Kingdom of Israel (united monarchy)|Kingdom of Israel]], but modern scholarship generally holds that the united monarchy is ahistorical.&lt;ref name=Kuhrtp438&gt;{{cite book|last=Kuhrt|first=Amiele|title=The Ancient Near East|year=1995|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-0415167628|page=438}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Finkelstein, Israel 2002"&gt;Finkelstein, Israel, and Silberman, Neil Asher, ''The Bible Unearthed : Archaeology's New Vision of Ancient Israel and the Origin of Its Sacred Texts'', Simon &amp; Schuster, 2002. {{ISBN|0-684-86912-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bibleinterp.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bibleinterp.com/articles/2014/07/wri388001.shtml |title=The Bible and Interpretation - David, King of Judah (Not Israel) |publisher=Bibleinterp.com |date=2014-07-13 |accessdate=2018-09-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Thompson, Thomas L., 1999, ''The Bible in History: How Writers Create a Past'', Jonathan Cape, London, {{ISBN|978-0-224-03977-2}} p. 207&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the Northern Kingdom was conquered into the [[Neo-Assyrian Empire]] in 720&amp;nbsp;BCE. The Kingdom of Judah remained nominally independent, but paid tribute to the Assyrian Empire from 715 and throughout the first half of the 7th century BCE, regaining its independence as the Assyrian Empire declined after 640&amp;nbsp;BCE, but after 609 again fell under the sway of imperial rule, this time paying tribute at first to the Egyptians and after 601&amp;nbsp;BCE to the [[Neo-Babylonian Empire]], until 586&amp;nbsp;BCE, when it was finally conquered by Babylonia.

Judea is central to much of the narrative of the [[Torah]], with the [[Patriarchs]] [[Abraham]], [[Isaac]] and [[Jacob]] said to have been buried at [[Hebron]] in the [[Tomb of the Patriarchs]].

===Persian and Hellenistic periods===
[[File:1stMithritadicwar89BC.png|thumb|left|Hasmonean Kingdom at its greatest extent under [[Salome Alexandra]]]]

Judea remained under Persian rule until the conquest of [[Alexander the Great]] in 332&amp;nbsp;BCE, eventually falling under the rule of the [[Hellenistic period|Hellenistic]] [[Seleucid Empire]] until the revolt of [[Judas Maccabeus]] resulted in the [[Hasmonean]] dynasty of Kings who ruled in Judea for over a century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Roman conquest===
{{See also|Judea (Roman province)}}
Judea lost its independence to the Romans in the 1st century BCE, by becoming first a tributary kingdom, then a province, of the Roman Empire. The Romans had allied themselves to the [[Maccabees]] and interfered again in 63&amp;nbsp;BCE, at the end of the [[Third Mithridatic War]], when the [[proconsul]] Pompeius Magnus ("[[Pompey the Great]]") stayed behind to make the area secure for Rome, including his [[Siege of Jerusalem (63 BC)|siege of Jerusalem in 63 BCE]]. Queen [[Alexandra Salome]] had recently died, and a civil war broke out between her sons, [[Hyrcanus II]] and [[Aristobulus II]]. Pompeius restored Hyrcanus but political rule passed to the [[Herodian Dynasty|Herodian family]] who ruled as [[Iudaea Province#The client kingdom of Judea|client kings]]. In 6&amp;nbsp;CE, Judea came under direct Roman rule as the southern part of the province of [[Iudaea Province|Iudaea]], although Jews living in the province still maintained some form of independence and could judge offenders by their own laws, including capital offences, until c. 28 CE.&lt;ref&gt;[[Babylonian Talmud]], ''Avodah Zarah'' 8b; ibid, ''Sanhedrin'' 41a&lt;/ref&gt; The Province of Judea, during the late [[Hellenistic period]] and early [[Roman period]] was also divided into five conclaves: Jerusalem ('''ירושלם'''), [[Gadara]] ('''גדרה'''), [[Amathus, Transjordan|Amathus]] ('''עמתו'''), [[Jericho]] ('''יריחו'''), and [[Sepphoris]] ('''צפורין'''),&lt;ref&gt;[[Josephus]], ''Antiquities'' Book 14, chapter 5, verse 4&lt;/ref&gt; and during the Roman period had eleven administrative districts (toparchies): Jerusalem, [[Gophna]], [[Akrabatta]], [[Khirbet Tibnah|Thamna]], [[Lydda]], [[Emmaus Nicopolis|Ammaus]], [[Pella, Jordan|Pella]], [[Idumaea]], [[Engaddi]], [[Herodium|Herodeion]], and [[Jericho]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Schürer |first=E. |author-link=Emil Schürer |title=Geschichte des jüdischen Volkes im Zeitalter Jesu Christi [A History of the Jewish People in the Time of Jesus Christ] |publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons |translator=Miss Taylor |volume=1 |edition= |date=1891 |location=New York |page=157 |language= English |url=https://babel.hathitrust.org/cgi/pt?id=hvd.ah63dw;view=1up;seq=171 |doi= |id= |isbn= |jfm= }} Cf.

Jerusalem was [[Siege of Jerusalem (AD 70)|besieged in 70&amp;nbsp;CE]] and much of the population was killed or enslaved.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Bar Kokhba revolt===
{{main|Bar Kokhba revolt}}
Another 70 years later, the Jewish population revolted under the leadership of [[Simon bar Kokhba]] and established the last Kingdom of Israel, which lasted three years, before the Romans managed to conquer the province for good, at a high cost in terms of manpower and expense.

After the defeat of Bar Kokhba (132–135&amp;nbsp;CE) the [[Roman Emperor]] [[Hadrian]] was determined to wipe out the identity of Israel-Judah-Judea, and renamed it [[Syria Palaestina]]. Until that time the area had been called "province of Judea" ([[Roman Judea]]) by the Romans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/palname.html |title=The Name "Palestine" |publisher=Jewish Virtual Library |date= |accessdate=2010-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the same time, he changed the name of the city of [[Jerusalem]] to ''[[Aelia Capitolina]]''. The Romans killed many Jews and sold many more into slavery; many Jews departed into the [[Jewish diaspora]], but there was never a complete Jewish abandonment of the area, and Jews have been an important (and sometimes persecuted) minority in Judea since that time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

===Byzantine period===
[[File:Israel Byzantine 5c.jpg|300px|right|thumb|5th century CE: Byzantine provinces of [[Palaestina Prima|Palaestina I]] (Philistia, Judea and Samaria) and ''Palaestina II'' (Galilee and Perea)]]

The Byzantines redrew the borders of the Land of Palestine. The various Roman provinces (Syria Palaestina, Samaria, Galilee, and Peraea) were reorganized into three diocese of Palaestina, reverting to the name first used by Greek historian [[Herodotus]] in the mid-5th century BCE: [[Palaestina Prima]], [[Palaestina Secunda|Secunda]], and Tertia or Salutaris (First, Second, and Third Palestine), part of the [[Diocese of the East]].&lt;ref name="Shahinp8"&gt;Shahin (2005), p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=NYTimesIdniopulos&gt;{{cite news|title=Weathered by Miracles: A History of Palestine From Bonaparte and Muhammad Ali to Ben-Gurion and the Mufti|author=Thomas A.

''Palaestina Secunda'' consisted of the Galilee, the lower [[Jezreel Valley]], the regions east of Galilee, and the western part of the former [[Decapolis]] with the seat of government at [[Beit She'an|Scythopolis]]. ''Palaestina Tertia'' included the [[Negev]], southern Jordan—once part of Arabia—and most of [[Sinai Peninsula|Sinai]] with [[Petra]] as the usual residence of the governor. Palestina Tertia was also known as Palaestina Salutaris.&lt;ref name="Shahinp8" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Salutaris"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-439113/Palaestina-Salutaris|title=Roman Arabia|publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071011233133/http://www.britannica.com/eb/topic-439113/Palaestina-Salutaris|archive-date=2007-10-11|accessdate=2007-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to historian H.H.

Ben-Sasson, ''A History of the Jewish People'', Harvard University Press, 1976, {{ISBN|0-674-39731-2}}, p. 351&lt;/ref&gt; this reorganisation took place under [[Diocletian]] (284–305), although other scholars suggest this change occurred later in 390.{{Citation needed|date=July 2011}}

==Oil export revenues== 
Academic contributions have written about differences in petroleum revenue management in various countries. Many scholars see the natural resource wealth in some countries as a natural resource blessing, while in others it has been referred to as a natural [[resource curse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |newspaper=European Economic Review |url=http://mais611.wiki.usfca.edu/file/view/Sachs+and+Warner+Curse+of+Natural+Resources.pdf |title=The curse of natural resources |author1=Sachs J.

[[File:Rail density map.svg|thumb|350px|Map of the world with rail density (length of rail network divided by area of country) highlighted. This does not necessarily reflect actual rail use.]]

This is a '''list of countries by rail usage'''. Rail usage may be measured in tonne-kilometres (tkm) or passenger-kilometres (pkm) travelled for [[freight]] and [[passenger rail|passenger transport]] respectively. This is the number of tonnes or passengers multiplied by the average distance of their journeys in kilometres.

== Overview ==
Almost 10,000 billion freight tonne-kilometres are travelled around the world. Roughly one quarter of these are travelled in the [[United States]], another quarter in [[China]], and a third in [[Russia]]. Of the 3,000bn passenger-kilometres travelled across the world, 1,346bn of these are travelled solely in [[China]]. The average Swiss person travels 2,430&amp;nbsp;km by train each year, almost 500 more than the average Japanese person (the Japanese having the second-highest average kilometres travelled per passenger in the world).

In 2014 there were around 1 million kilometres of railway in the world (a decrease of 3% compared to 2013). Of this, 350,000&amp;nbsp;km were in Europe and mainly used for passenger service, 370,000&amp;nbsp;km were in North America and mainly used for freight, and 230,000&amp;nbsp;km were in Asia and used for both freight and passenger service.&lt;ref name=UICRS /&gt; In America and Europe, there are many low cost airlines and motorways which compete with rail for passenger traffic, while Asia has seen a large growth in [[high-speed rail]] with 257bn pkm representing 72% of total world high-speed rail passenger traffic.&lt;ref name=UICRS /&gt;

== Passenger rail ==
These figures do not include [[rapid transit|metro]] railway systems; see ''[[Lists of rapid transit systems]]'' for metro rail statistics.

=== Passenger-kilometres of rail transport per year ===
{{Refimprove section|date=April 2015}}
''Countries with more than five billion passenger-kilometres (tkm) travelled per year. Unless otherwise specified, data come from the [http://www.uic.org/IMG/pdf/synopsis_2015_print_5_.pdf Railway Statistics 2015 Report] by the [[International Union of Railways]] (UIC).''
&lt;!-- If possible, use UIC data, as they are collected using same methodology. Use another source only if UIC data are old (3+ years) or incomplete (covering only one major railway company in the country). --&gt;

[[File:NasaBenelux.jpg|upright=1.35|thumb|The Low Countries as seen from space]]

The '''Low Countries''', the '''Low Lands''' ({{lang-nl|de Lage Landen}}, {{lang-fr|les Pays Bas}}), or historically also '''the Netherlands''' ({{lang-nl|de Nederlanden}}), is a coastal lowland region in northwestern [[Europe]], forming the lower basin of the [[Rhine]], [[Meuse]], and [[Scheldt]] rivers, divided in the [[Middle Ages]] into numerous semi-independent principalities that consolidated in the countries of [[Belgium]], [[Luxembourg]], and the [[Netherlands]], as well as today's [[French Flanders]].&lt;ref name="britannica"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia | title=Low Countries | encyclopedia=Encyclopædia Britannica | publisher=Encyclopædia Britannica, Inc. | url=http://www.britannica.com/EBchecked/topic/349663/Low-Countries | accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Low+Countries | title=Low Countries - definition of Low Countries by the Free Online Dictionary, Thesaurus and Encyclopedia. | publisher=Farlex, Inc. | accessdate=26 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Historically, the regions without access to the sea have linked themselves politically and economically to those with access to form various unions of ports and [[hinterland]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Matei-Chesnoiu |first1=Monica |title=Re-imagining Western European Geography in English Renaissance Drama |date=2012 |publisher=Palgrave Macmillan |isbn=9780230366305 |page=105 |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=B3M_zRR-AmcC&amp;lpg=PA105&amp;pg=PA105#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; stretching inland as far as parts of the German [[Rhineland]]. It is why that nowadays some parts of the Low Countries are actually hilly, like Luxembourg and the south of Belgium. Within the [[European Union]] the region's political grouping is still referred to as the [[Benelux]] (short for Belgium-Netherlands-Luxembourg).

During the [[Roman empire]] the region contained a militarised frontier and contact point between [[Rome]] and [[Germanic peoples|Germanic tribes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Turner |first1=Barry |title=The Statesman's Yearbook 2011: The Politics, Cultures and Economies of the World |date=2010 |publisher=Springer |isbn=9781349586356 |page=908 |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=h5LlDQAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA908&amp;pg=PA908#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the collapse of the empire, the Low Countries were the scene of the early independent trading centres, that marked the reawakening of [[Europe]] in the 12th century. In that period, they rivalled [[Northern Italy|northern Italy]] as one of the most densely populated regions of [[Western Europe]]. Most of the cities were governed by guilds and councils along with a figurehead ruler; interaction with their ruler was regulated by a strict set of rules describing what the latter could and could not expect from them. All of the regions mainly depended on trade, manufacturing and the encouragement of the free flow of goods and craftsmen.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Braudel |first1=Fernand |title=Civilization and Capitalism, 15th-18th Century, Vol. III: The Perspective of the World |date=1992 |publisher=University of California Press |isbn=9780520081161 |page=98 |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=xMZI2QEer9QC&amp;lpg=PA98&amp;pg=PA98#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Dutch language|Dutch]] and [[French language|French]] dialects were the main languages used in secular city life.

Historically, [[Terminology_of_the_Low_Countries#Netherlands|the term ''Low Countries'']] arose at the Court of the [[Duke of Burgundy#House of Valois-Burgundy (1361–1482)|Dukes of Burgundy]], who used the term ''{{lang|fr|les pays de par deçà}}'' ("the lands over here") for the Low Countries as opposed to ''{{lang|fr|les pays de par delà}}'' ("the lands over there") for the [[Duchy of Burgundy]] and the [[County of Burgundy|Free County of Burgundy]], which were part of their realm but geographically disconnected from the Low Countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://vre.leidenuniv.nl/vre/dutchrevolt/dutch/verhaal/Pages/verhaal01.aspx |title=1.

Today the term is typically fitted to modern political boundaries&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Low Countries |url=http://www.thefreedictionary.com/Low+Countries |website=TheFreeDictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Low Countries {{!}} region, Europe |url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Low-Countries |website=Encyclopedia Britannica |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; and used in the same way as the term ''[[Benelux]]''.

The name of the country of the [[Netherlands]] has the same etymology and origin as the name for the region Low Countries, due to "nether" meaning "low".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=netherlands {{!}} Origin and meaning of netherlands by Online Etymology Dictionary |url=https://www.etymonline.com/word/Netherlands#etymonline_v_35463 |website=www.etymonline.com |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the Dutch language itself ''De Lage Landen'' is the modern term for Low Countries, and ''De Nederlanden'' (plural) is in use for the 16th century domains of [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]], the historic Low Countries, while ''Nederland'' (singular) is in use for the country of the Netherlands. However, in official use, the name of the Dutch kingdom is still [[Kingdom of the Netherlands]], ''{{lang|nl|Koninkrijk der Nederlanden}}'' (plural). This name derives from the 19th-century origins of the kingdom which originally included present-day Belgium.

In Dutch, and to a lesser extent in English, the Low Countries colloquially means the Netherlands and Belgium, sometimes the Netherlands and [[Flanders]]—the Dutch-speaking north of Belgium. For example, a ''{{lang|nl|[[Low Countries derby]]}}'' (''Derby der Lage Landen''), is a sports event between Belgium and the Netherlands.

Belgium separated in 1830 from the (northern) Netherlands. The new country took its name from ''Belgica'', the [[Latinisation of names|Latinised]] name for the Low Countries, as it was known during the [[Eighty Years' War]] (1568–1648). The Low Countries were in that war divided in two parts. On one hand, the northern [[Dutch Republic|Federated Netherlands]] or ''Belgica Foederata'' rebelled against the Spanish king; on the other, the southern [[Spanish Netherlands|Royal Netherlands]] or ''Belgica Regia'' remained loyal to the Spanish king.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Buys |first1=Ruben |title=Sparks of Reason: Vernacular Rationalism in the Low Countries, 1550-1670 |date=2015 |publisher=Uitgeverij Verloren |isbn=9789087045159 |page=17 |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=286ECgAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA17&amp;pg=PA17#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; This divide laid the early foundation for the later modern states of Belgium and the Netherlands.

== History ==
{{History of the Low Countries}}
{{see also|History of urban centers in the Low Countries}}
The region politically had its origins in [[Carolingian empire]]; more precisely, most of the people in it was within the Duchy of [[Lower Lotharingia]].&lt;ref name="Franks (Columbia Encyclopedia)"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/topic/Franks.aspx | title=Franks | publisher=[[Columbia University Press]] | work=[[Columbia Encyclopedia]] | year=2013 | accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://nobhist.narod.ru/lorraine.html | title=Lotharingia / Lorraine ( Lothringen ) | date=5 September 2013 | accessdate=1 February 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the disintegration of Lower Lotharingia, the Low Countries were brought under the rule of various lordships until they came to be in the hands of the [[House of Valois-Burgundy|Valois Dukes of Burgundy]]. Hence, a large part of the low countries came to be referred to as the [[Burgundian Netherlands]] also called the [[Seventeen Provinces]] up to 1581. Even after the political [[secession]] of the autonomous [[Dutch Republic]] (or "United Provinces") in the north, the term "low countries" continued to be used to refer collectively to the region. The region was temporarily united politically between 1815 and 1839, as the [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]], before this split into the three modern countries of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.

===Early history===
{{see also|Gallia Belgica|Germania Inferior}}
The Low Countries were part of the [[Roman Empire|Roman]] provinces of [[Gallia Belgica]] and [[Germania Inferior]]. They were inhabited by [[Belgic]] and [[Germanic tribes]]. In the 4th and 5th century, [[Franks|Frankish]] tribes had entered this Roman region and came to run it increasingly independently. They came to be ruled by the [[Merovingian dynasty]], under which dynasty the southern part (below the [[Rhine]]) was re-[[Christianization|Christianised]].

===Frankish empire===
{{see also|Lower Lorraine}}
By the end of the 8th century, the Low Countries formed a core part of a much expanded [[Francia]] and the Merovingians were replaced by the [[Carolingian dynasty]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Ramirez-Faria |first1=Carlos |title=Concise Encyclopeida Of World History |date=2007 |publisher=Atlantic Publishers &amp; Dist |isbn=9788126907755 |page=683 |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=gGKsS-9h4BYC&amp;pg=PA683#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 800, the Pope crowned and appointed [[Charlemagne]] [[Holy Roman Emperor|Emperor]] of the re-established [[Holy Roman Empire|Roman Empire]].

After the death of Charlemagne, Francia was divided in three parts among his three grandsons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Chopra |first1=Hardev Singh |title=De Gaulle and European Unity |date=1974 |publisher=Abhinav Publications |isbn=9780883862889 |page=131 |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=VedEZydsEYMC&amp;pg=PA131#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The middle slice, [[Middle Francia]], was ruled by [[Lothair I]], and thereby also came to be referred to as "Lotharingia" or "Lorraine". Apart from the original coastal [[County of Flanders]], which was within [[West Francia]], the rest of the Low Countries were within the lowland part of this, "[[Lower Lorraine]]".

After the death of Lothair, the Low Countries were coveted by the rulers of both [[West Francia]] and [[East Francia]]. Each tried to swallow the region and to merge it with their spheres of influence. Thus, the Low Countries consisted of [[fief]]s whose sovereignty resided with either the [[Kingdom of France (987–1498)]] or the [[Holy Roman Empire]]. While the further history the Low Countries can be seen as the object of a continual struggle between these two powers, the title of [[Duke of Lothier]] was coveted in the low countries for centuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Jeep |first1=John M. |title=Routledge Revivals: Medieval Germany (2001): An Encyclopedia |date=2017 |publisher=Routledge |isbn=9781351665391 |page=291-295 |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=ikArDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT291#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Duchy of Burgundy===
{{see also|Burgundian Netherlands}}
In the 14th and 15th century, separate fiefs came gradually to be ruled by a single family through [[royal intermarriage]]. This process culminated in the rule of the [[House of Valois]], who were the rulers of the [[Duchy of Burgundy]]. During the height of Burgundian influence, the Low Countries became the political and economic centre of [[Northern Europe]], noted for its crafts and luxury goods, notably [[early Netherlandish painting]], which is the work of artists who were active in the flourishing cities of [[Bruges]], [[Ghent]], [[Mechelen]], [[Louvain, Belgium|Louvain]], [[Tournai]] and [[Brussels]], all in present-day Belgium.[[Image:Van Eyck - Arnolfini Portrait.jpg|thumb|200px|[[Jan van Eyck]], The ''[[Arnolfini Portrait]]'', 1434, [[National Gallery]], London]]

===Seventeen Provinces===
{{see also|Habsburg Netherlands}}
In 1477 the [[Duchy of Burgundy|Burgundian holdings]] in the area passed through an heiress—[[Mary of Burgundy]]—to the [[Habsburgs]]. The Low Countries were roughly divided into [[Seventeen Provinces]]. [[Charles V, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles V]] united the provinces into one indivisible territory, covered by the [[Pragmatic Sanction of 1549]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History of Luxembourg: Primary Documents|url=https://eudocs.lib.byu.edu/index.php/History_of_Luxembourg:_Primary_Documents|website=EuroDocs|accessdate=Sep 10, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; while retaining existing customs, laws, and forms of government within the provinces.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Limm |first1=P. |title=The Dutch Revolt 1559 - 1648 |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=ibmOAwAAQBAJ&amp;lpg=PA6&amp;ots=eaSa6rTAbC&amp;dq=Pragmatic%20Sanction%20contributed%20to%20the%20Dutch%20Revolt&amp;pg=PA6#v=onepage&amp;q=pragmatic%20sanction&amp;f=false |publisher=Routledge |accessdate=20 October 2018 |language=en |date=12 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, Charles V introduced the title of ''Heer der Nederlanden'' ("Lord of the Netherlands"). Only he and his son could ever use this title.

The Pragmatic Sanction transformed the agglomeration of lands into a unified entity, of which the [[Habsburg]]s would be the heirs. By streamlining the succession law in all Seventeen Provinces and declaring that all of them would be inherited by one heir, Charles effectively united the Netherlands as one entity. After Charles' abdication in 1555, the Seventeen Provinces passed to his son, [[Philip II of Spain]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ronald |first1=Susan |title=Heretic Queen: Queen Elizabeth I and the Wars of Religion |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=o2SAFik2aTIC&amp;pg=PT89&amp;dq=pragmatic+sanction+of+1549&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUstCg45TeAhUSMewKHf-2CBkQ6AEIUzAI#v=onepage&amp;q=pragmatic%20sanction%20of%201549&amp;f=false |publisher=St. Martin's Press |accessdate=20 October 2018 |language=en |date=7 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Division===
{{see also|Dutch Republic|Spanish Netherlands}}
The Pragmatic Sanction is said to be one example of the Habsburg contest with [[political particularism|particularism]] that contributed to the [[Dutch Revolt]]. Each of the provinces had its own laws, customs and political practices. The new policy, imposed from the outside, angered many inhabitants, who viewed their provinces as distinct entities. It and other monarchical acts, such as the creation of bishoprics and promulgation of laws against [[heresy]], stoked resentments, which fired the eruption of the [[Dutch Revolt]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=State |first1=Paul F. |title=A Brief History of the Netherlands |date=2008 |publisher=Infobase Publishing |isbn=9781438108322 |page=46 |url=https://books.google.nl/books?id=5CTlTZlWU0IC&amp;lpg=PA37&amp;dq=pragmatic%20sanction%20of%201549&amp;pg=PA46#v=onepage&amp;q=pragmatic%20sanction&amp;f=true |accessdate=20 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the northern [[Seven United Provinces]] of the seventeen declared their independence from [[Habsburg Spain]] in 1581, the ten provinces of the [[Southern Netherlands]] remained occupied by the [[Army of Flanders]] under Spanish service and are therefore sometimes called the [[Spanish Netherlands]]. In 1713, under the [[Treaty of Utrecht]] following the [[War of the Spanish Succession]], what was left of the Spanish Netherlands was ceded to [[Austria]] and thus became known as the [[Austrian Netherlands]]. 

===Late Modern Period===
{{see also|United Kingdom of the Netherlands|Benelux}}
The [[United Kingdom of the Netherlands]] (1815–1830) temporarily united the Low Countries again, before this split into the three modern countries of the Netherlands, Belgium and Luxembourg.

During the early months of [[World War I]] (around 1914), The [[Central Powers]] invaded the Low Countries of [[Luxembourg]] and [[Belgium]] in what has been come to be known as the [[German invasion of Belgium]]. It led to the German occupation of the two countries. However, the German advance into [[France]] was quickly halted, causing a military stalemate for most of the war. In the end, a total of approximately 56,000 people were killed in the invasion.&lt;ref name="ia800502.us.archive.org"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://archive.org/details/statisticsofmili00grea |title=Statistics of the military effort of the British Empire during the Great War, 1914–1920 |last=Great Britain. War Office |date=14 April 2018 |publisher=London H.M. Stationery Off |accessdate=14 April 2018 |via=Internet Archive}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[World War II]] started in the region when [[Adolf Hitler]]'s [[Wehrmacht]] forces turned their eyes west to France. The Low Countries were an easy route of getting around the feared French [[Maginot Line]]. Hitler ordered a conquest of the Low Countries to be executed at the shortest possible notice to forestall the French and prevent [[Allies of World War 2|Allied]] [[air power]] from threatening the vital German [[Ruhr Area]].&lt;ref&gt;Frieser 2005, p. 74.&lt;/ref&gt; It would also provide the basis for a long-term air and sea campaign against Britain. As much as possible of the border areas in northern France should be occupied.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://der-fuehrer.org/reden/english/wardirectives/06.html|title= Directive No. 6 Full Text|access-date=5 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Germany used its [[Blitzkrieg]] tactics and took out the countries in a matter of two weeks. 

Belgium, the Netherlands, and Luxembourg were occupied from about May 1940 to about May 1945. During the occupation, their governments were forced to be exiled in Britain. In 1944, they signed the [[London Customs Convention]], laying the foundation for the [[Benelux|Benelux Economic Union]],&lt;ref name=Yapou1&gt;{{cite book|last=Yapou|first=Eliezer|title=Governments in Exile, 1939–1945|year=1998|location=Jerusalem|url=http://governmentsinexile.com/yapouluxembourg.html|chapter=Luxembourg: The Smallest Ally}}&lt;/ref&gt; an important forerunner of the [[EEC]] (later the [[EU]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Park |first1=Jehoon |last2=Pempel |first2=T.

==Literature==
One of the Low Countries' earliest literary figures is the blind poet [[Bernlef]], from {{circa|800}}, who sang both Christian psalms and pagan verses. Bernlef is representative of the coexistence of [[Christianity]] and [[Germanic paganism|Germanic polytheism]] in this time period.&lt;ref name="Lit-History"&gt;{{cite book|last=Hermans|first=edited by Theo|title=A literary history of the Low Countries|year=2009|publisher=Camden House|location=Rochester, N.Y.|isbn=1-57113-293-7|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=N1SgcVffQ_MC&amp;lpg=PP1&amp;dq=the%20low%20countries&amp;pg=PA3#v=onepage&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|1–2}}

The earliest examples of written literature include the [[Wachtendonck Psalms]], a collection of twenty five psalms that originated in the Moselle-Frankish region around the middle of the 9th century.&lt;ref name="Lit-History" /&gt;{{rp|3}}

&lt;!-- todo: find out how to put that [1] in text and link it to see also where more complete explanation can be easily given. I've truncated it somewhat, but most people should understand they can only use Swedish or their requests/mail/official paper from any official/whatever may go straight to the thashcan. Internal link to middle of sentence or specific line is not easily found from basic edit help pages at least. If you can fix this please do so, I follow the page and see example then thank you :) --&gt;

'''Heroica Nogales''' ({{IPA-es|eˈɾoika noˈɣales}}), more commonly known as '''Nogales,''' is a city and the county seat of the [[Nogales Municipality, Sonora|Municipality of Nogales]]. It is located on the northern border of the Mexican state of [[Sonora]]. The city is abutted on its north by the city of [[Nogales, Arizona]], across the [[Mexico–United States border|U.S.-Mexico border]].

==History==
The independent Nogales Municipality, which included the town of Nogales, was established on July 11, 1884.&lt;ref&gt;date of the publication of Law No. 29, which had been signed the previous day by the then Governor of Sonora, Luis Emeterio Torres.&lt;/ref&gt; The Nogales Municipality covers an area of 1,675&amp;nbsp;km². Nogales was declared a city within the Municipality on January 1, 1920.

===Batalla del 27 de agosto de 1918 ~ Battle of Ambos Nogales===

{{main article|Battle of Ambos Nogales}}
The international trade that existed between the two cities greatly propelled the economic development of Nogales, Sonora, and the greater Northern Sonora region, but that did not prevent significant problems from forming in the area after the outbreak of the 1910 [[Mexican Revolution]].

[[File:Panoramic view of the city of Nogales, Mexico, ca.1905 (CHS-1523).jpg|thumb|Panoramic view of the city of Nogales, Mexico, ca.1905]]

On August 27, 1918, at about 4:10&amp;nbsp;pm, a gun battle erupted unintentionally when a Mexican civilian attempted to pass through the border, back to Mexico, without being interrogated at the [[U.S. Customs]] house.  After the initial shooting, reinforcements from both sides rushed to the border. On the Mexican side, the majority of the belligerents were angry civilians upset with the killings of Mexican border crossers by the U.S. Army along the vaguely defined border between the two cities during the previous year (the [[United States Border Patrol|U.S. Border Patrol]] did not exist until [[Immigration Act of 1924|1924]]). For the Americans, the reinforcements were the 10th Cavalry, off-duty 35th Regimental soldiers and militia. Hostilities quickly escalated and several soldiers were killed and others wounded on both sides. The mayor of Nogales, Sonora, Felix B. Peñaloza was killed when waving a white truce flag/handkerchief with his cane.

[[File:Tumba de Felix Penaloza 2008.jpg|thumbnail|left|The tomb of Felix B. Penaloza (Mayor of Nogales, Sonora, in August 1918) at the Panteon de los Heroes, Heroica Nogales, Sonora, Mexico]]

Due in part to the heightened hysteria caused by World War I, allegations surfaced that German agents fomented this violence and died fighting alongside the Mexican troops it was claimed they led into battle. U.S. newspaper reports in Nogales prior to the August 27, 1918 battle documented the departure of the Mexican garrison in Nogales, Sonora, to points south that August in an attempt to quell armed political rebels.&lt;ref&gt;General DeRosey C. Cabell, “Report on Recent Trouble at Nogales, 1 September 1918,” Battle of Nogales 1918 Collection, Pimeria Alta Historical Society (Nogales, AZ). See also DeRosey C. Cabell, “Memorandum for the Adjutant General: Subject: Copy of Records to be Furnished to the Secretary of the Treasury. 30 September 1918,” Battle of Nogales 1918 Collection, Pimeria Alta Historical Society (Nogales, AZ).&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, an investigation by Army officials from [[Fort Huachuca|Fort Huachuca, Arizona]], could not substantiate accusations of militant German agents in the Mexican border community and instead traced the origins of the violence to the abuse of Mexican border crossers in the year prior to the Battle of Ambos Nogales. The main result of this battle was the building of the first permanent border fence between the two cities of Nogales.&lt;ref&gt;“Military Commanders Hold Final Conference Sunday,” ''Nogales Evening Daily Herald'' (Nogales, AZ), September 2, 1918; Daniel Arreola, “La Cerca y Las Garitas de Ambos Nogales: A Postcard Landscape Exploration,” ''Journal of the Southwest'', vol. 43 (Winter 2001), pp. 504-541&lt;/ref&gt; Though largely unheard of in the U.S. (and even within most of Mexico), the municipal leaders of Nogales, Sonora, successfully petitioned the Mexican Congress in 1961 to grant the Mexican border city the title of "Heroic City", leading the community's official name, '''Heroica Nogales''', a distinction shared with the Sonoran cities of [[Guaymas]], [[Caborca]], and [[Ures]], and a number of other cities in Mexico.

===Escobarista Rebellion===
Early in March 1929, the Escobarista Rebellion exploded in Nogales, sponsored by Obregonistas, supporters of Mexican president [[Álvaro Obregón]], who had been assassinated on July 17, 1928. General Manuel Aguirre, commanding the rebellious 64th Regiment, took power without firing a shot, causing ''federales'' from [[Naco, Sonora|Naco]] to send a daily airplane to attack the rebels. It dropped a few bombs over Nogales without doing any damage, while the rebels fought back with machine guns from the roofs without doing any damage to the airplane. There was only one casualty, a woman who was scared by a bomb explosion and had a heart attack. That same month, a hooded man appeared at night driving a tank on Morley Street on the U.S. side, then entered Mexico to help the ''federales'' in Naco. It seems that the tank had been bought in 1927 for fighting the [[Yaqui people|Yaquis]], but U.S. officials prohibited it from leaving the U.S., and it had been kept in a warehouse in [[Nogales, Arizona]].&lt;ref name="escobarismo"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.municipiodenogales.org/escobarismo.htm| title=La rebellion escobarista| accessdate=2007-10-19| author= Municipio de Nogales |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070716151408/http://www.municipiodenogales.org/escobarismo.htm &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-07-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Demographics==
{{As of|2000}}, the census reported that the City of Nogales had a population of 159,103 people, representing approximately 50% growth from 1990. By the 2005 census the official population of the city was 189,759, and that of Nogales Municipality was 193,517. At the latest census in 2010, the official numbers were 212,533 for the City of Nogales, and 220,292 for the Municipality.

The city and the municipality both rank third in the state in population, after [[Hermosillo]] and [[Ciudad Obregón]]. The municipality includes many outlying but small rural communities. The only other localities with over 1,000 inhabitants are La Mesa (2,996) {{coord|31|09|35|N|110|58|28|W|scale:10000_source:INEGI}} and Centro de Readaptación Social Nuevo (2,203) {{coord|31|11|04|N|110|58|04|W|scale:10000_source:INEGI}}. Nogales is served by [[Nogales International Airport (Mexico)|Nogales International Airport]].

The population growth is in part due to the influx of industry that has come since the opening of the [[maquiladora]] industry through the National Industrialization Program, decades before the [[North American Free Trade Agreement]] (NAFTA). During the 90s, this economic context was, in part, held by an important Sonora state social policy by the Secretary of Urban Infrastructure and Ecology, [[Vernon Perez Rubio]], accomplishing the city´s total coverage on drinking water, with a 20-year guaranteed service.&lt;ref&gt;Sonora State Government. Newsletter from the Sonora State Diffusion Board, Puerto Peñasco County. Volume CLV, Number 40, Secc. V. 18 May 1995, Hermosillo, Sonora.&lt;/ref&gt; Manufacturing now accounts for 55% of the city's [[gross domestic product]], and services are growing as well, most of this caused by the growing jobs in the city.

Nogales is known for its recent enormous population growth which covers the hills along the central narrow north-south valley. Dispersed among the houses, the visitor will find a mixture of factories, stores, etc. In 2006, the southern half of the city experienced a modern urbanization development including shopping malls, wide avenues, and modern housing conglomerations.

==Monuments==
At the center of Nogales, there is the Plaza de Benito Juárez. Here there is a statue with two leading figures designed by Spanish sculptor Alfredo Just. This is a tribute to Mexican President Benito Juárez, and the other is the "Monument to Ignorance", where a naked man who represents the Mexican people is fighting with a winged creature that represents ignorance.

==Economy==

===Transportation===
The primary commercial artery is [[Mexico Federal Highway 15]], which links the state with the U.S. as well as major cities in Mexico.

In aviation, the city is served by the [[Nogales International Airport (Mexico)|Aeropuerto internacional de Nogales]], which, {{as of|2015|lc=y}} had no commercial airline service.

===Tourism===
Due to its location, Nogales is one of the most important ports of entry for U.S. tourists.  The downtown area consists of bars, strip clubs, hotels, restaurants, and a large number of curio stores, which sell a large variety of artesanias (handicrafts, leather art, handmade flowers, clothes) brought from the deeper central and southern states of Mexico. Local dishes commonly available in restaurants include many types of antojitos (Mexican food) such as enchiladas, tacos, burritos with carne machaca (dried meat), menudo and tamales.&lt;ref name="sonora"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sonora.gob.mx/portal/Runscript.asp?p=ASP\pg212.asp|title=Municipio de Nogales Official Site|accessdate=2007-10-19|author=City of Nogales |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20070504191527/http://www.sonora.gob.mx/portal/Runscript.asp?p=ASP%5cpg212.asp &lt;!-- Bot retrieved archive --&gt; |archivedate = 2007-05-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Manufacturing===
[[Maquiladora]]s, or manufacturing plants, employ a large percentage of the population. Nogales' proximity to the U.S. and the abundance of inexpensive labor make it an efficient location for foreign companies to have manufacturing and assembly operations. Some of the companies that have established maquiladoras in Nogales include: [[Continental AG]], [[The Chamberlain Group]], [[Walbro]], [[General Electric]].

==== Production and export ====
Approximately 92 establishments produce foreign exports. Sixty-five of these establishments are located in seven industrial parks, which employ approximately 25,400 workers, around 50 percent of the total employed population of the municipality.&lt;ref name="sonora"/&gt;  Also important to the economy is livestock for both foreign export and cattle breeding.

==== Agriculture ====
Produce is one of Mexico's largest exports to the United States and the Mariposa Port of entry, at Nogales, is the most widely used route for produce destined for the U.S.  It is estimated that over 80 percent of Americas produce passes through Nogales each year.{{Citation needed|date=November 2018}} The produce industry requires facilities for the storage, packing, transport and logistics of these goods and provides many with employment on both sides of the border. November through March represent peak harvesting season and it is during these months when jobs are abundant and importation is at its highest.

== Municipal government ==
The Nogales Municipality was governed by the [[Institutional Revolutionary Party]] (PRI) for its entire history until the 2006 elections, when power shifted to the [[National Action Party (Mexico)|National Action Party]] (PAN).

== Religion ==
Since 13 March 2015, its Catedral Santuario de Nuestra Señora de Guadalupe is also the episcopal cathedral see of the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Nogales]]. It is a suffragan of the Metropolitan [[Archdiocese of Hermosillo]], from which its diocesan territory was split off.

== In Popular Culture == 
Nogales is discussed at length in the popular [[political economy|political economics]] book ''[[Why Nations Fail]]'', comparing the relative success of [[Nogales, Arizona]] north of the border to the poverty of Nogales, Sonora to the south.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Why_Nations_Fail.html?id=FXJvAAAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=kp_read_button#v=onepage&amp;q=Nogales&amp;f=false|title=Why Nations Fail: The Origins of Power, Prosperity, and Poverty|last=Acemoglu|first=Daron|last2=Robinson|first2=James A.|publisher=Currency|year=2017|isbn=978-0307719225|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
The Saola Working Group works with local Laotian communities to educate the importance of the Saola. Villagers are hired to remove hunting snares that are among the biggest threats to the animal. Camera traps to document range and population of Saola are another primary focus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3133">A '''Schmidt hammer''', also known as a '''Swiss hammer''' or a rebound hammer, is a device to measure the [[solid mechanics|elastic]] properties or strength of [[concrete]] or [[rock (geology)|rock]], mainly surface hardness and penetration resistance. It was invented by Ernst Schmidt, a Swiss engineer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.proceq.com/en/company-partners/proceq-group/history.html?pqr=2 Original Schmidt Hammer history]&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Schmidt hammer testing.jpg|thumbnail|Testing the compressive strength of a concrete cube using Schmidt hammer]]

The hammer measures the rebound of a spring-loaded mass impacting against the surface of a sample. The test hammer hits the concrete at a defined energy. Its rebound is dependent on the hardness of the concrete and is measured by the test equipment. By reference to a conversion chart, the rebound value can be used to determine the concrete's [[compressive strength]]. When conducting the test, the hammer should be held at right angles to the surface, which in turn should be flat and smooth. The rebound reading will be affected by the orientation of the hammer: when used oriented upward (for example, on the underside of a suspended slab), gravity will increase the rebound distance of the mass, and vice versa for a test conducted on a floor slab. Schmidt hammer measurements are on an arbitrary scale ranging from 10 to 100. 

Schmidt hammers are available from manufacturers in several different energy ranges, including (i) Type L-0.735 Nm impact energy, (ii) Type N-2.207 Nm impact energy, and (iii) Type M-29.43 Nm impact energy.

The test is also sensitive to other factors:
*Local variation in the sample. To minimize this, it is recommended to take a selection of readings and take an average or median value.
*Water content of the sample; a saturated material will give different results from a dry one.

Prior to testing, the Schmidt hammer should be calibrated using a calibration test anvil supplied by the manufacturer. Twelve readings should be taken, dropping the highest and lowest, and then taking the average of the ten remaining. This method of testing is classed as indirect as it does not give a direct measurement of the strength of the material. It simply gives an indication based on surface properties, and as such is suitable only for making comparisons between samples.  

This method for testing concrete is governed by [[ASTM International|ASTM]] C805.  ASTM D5873 describes the procedure for testing of rock.

The '''Highlands''' ({{lang-sco|the Hielands}}; {{lang-gd|A’ Ghàidhealtachd}} {{IPA-gd|ə ˈɣɛːəl̪ˠt̪ʰəxk|}}, "the place of the [[Gaels]]") is a historic region of [[Scotland]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.britannica.com/place/Highlands-region-Scotland|title=Highlands {{!}} region, Scotland, United Kingdom|work=Encyclopedia Britannica|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Culturally, the Highlands and the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]] diverged from the later [[Middle Ages]] into the [[modern period]], when [[Scots language|Lowland Scots]] replaced [[Scottish Gaelic]] throughout most of the Lowlands. The term is also used for the area north and west of the [[Highland Boundary Fault]], although the exact boundaries are not clearly defined, particularly to the east. The [[Great Glen]] divides the [[Grampian Mountains]] to the southeast from the [[Northwest Highlands]]. The [[Scottish Gaelic]] name of ''{{lang|gd|[[A' Ghàidhealtachd]]}}'' literally means "the place of the Gaels" and traditionally, from a Gaelic-speaking point of view, includes both the [[Western Isles]] and the Highlands.

The area is very sparsely populated, with many [[mountain range]]s dominating the region, and includes the highest mountain in the [[British Isles]], [[Ben Nevis]]. Before the 19th century the Highlands was home to a much larger population, but from ''circa'' 1841 and for the next 160 years, the natural increase in population was exceeded by emigration (mostly to Canada, the USA and Australia) and migration to the industrial cities of Scotland and England.&lt;ref name="Richards 2013"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Richards|first1=Eric|title=The Highland Clearances People, Landlords and Rural Turmoil|date=2000|publisher=Birlinn Limited|location=Edinburgh|isbn=978-1-78027-165-1|edition=2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|xxiii, 414 and ''passim''}} The area is now one of the most sparsely populated in [[Europe]]. At 9.1 per km&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; (23.6 per square mile) in 2012,&lt;ref name="density"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.highland.gov.uk/info/695/council_information_performance_and_statistics/165/highland_profile_-_key_facts_and_figures/2 |title=Highland profile — key facts and figures |publisher=[[Highland Council|The Highland Council]] |accessdate=2 June 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[population density]] in the Highlands and Islands is less than one seventh of Scotland's as a whole,&lt;ref name="density"/&gt; comparable with that of [[Bolivia]], [[Chad]] and [[Russia]].&lt;ref&gt;[[List of sovereign states and dependent territories by population density]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://kff.org/global-indicator/population-density/ |title=Global Health Facts : Demography &amp; Population : Population Density (Population Per Square Kilometer) |publisher=The Henry J Kaiser Family Foundation |accessdate=2 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Highland Council]] is the administrative body for much of the Highlands, with its administrative centre at [[Inverness]]. However, the Highlands also includes parts of the [[subdivisions of Scotland|council areas]] of [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]], [[Argyll and Bute]], [[Moray]], [[North Ayrshire]], [[Perth and Kinross]],  [[Stirling (council area)|Stirling]] and [[West Dunbartonshire]]. 

The Scottish highlands is the only area in the British Isles to have the [[taiga]] biome as it features concentrated populations of [[Scots pine]] forest: see [[Caledonian Forest]].

==History==

===Culture===
[[File:Scotland (Location) Named (HR).png|thumb|The main geographical divisions of Scotland]]
[[File:Battle of Alma Sutherland highlanders.png|thumb|[[Battle of Alma]], [[93rd (Sutherland Highlanders) Regiment of Foot|Sutherland Highlanders]]]]
Between the 15th century and the 20th century, the area differed from most of the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]] in terms of language. In Scottish Gaelic, the region is known as the ''{{lang|gd|[[Gàidhealtachd]]}}'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Martin Ball |author2=James Fife |title=The Celtic Languages |year=1993 |publisher=Routledge |page=136 |isbn=9780415010351 }}&lt;/ref&gt; because it was traditionally the Gaelic-speaking part of Scotland, although the language is now largely confined to [[The Hebrides]]. The terms are sometimes used interchangeably but have different meanings in their respective languages. [[Scottish English]] (in its [[Highland English|Highland form]]) is the predominant language of the area today, though Highland English has been influenced by Gaelic speech to a significant extent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Charles Jones |title=The Edinburgh History of the Scots Language |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |year=1997 |pages=566–567 |isbn=978-0748607549 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Historically, the "Highland line" distinguished the two Scottish cultures. While the Highland line broadly followed the geography of the Grampians in the south, it continued in the north, cutting off the north-eastern areas, that is [[Caithness]], [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]], from the more Gaelic Highlands and Hebrides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ladysue.webs.com/thescotsirish.htm |title=The Highland Line |publisher=Sue &amp; Marilyn |accessdate=8 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.electricscotland.com/webclans/geog/ |title=Historical Geography of the Clans of Scotland |publisher=Electricscotland.com |accessdate=8 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the aftermath of the [[Jacobitism|Jacobite]] risings, the British government enacted a series of laws to try to speed up the destruction of the [[Scottish clan|clan system]], including [[Disarming Act|bans on the bearing of arms]] and the wearing of [[tartan]], and limitations on the activities of the [[Scottish Episcopal Church]]. Most of this legislation was repealed by the end of the 18th century as the Jacobite threat subsided. There was soon a rehabilitation of Highland culture. Tartan was adopted for Highland regiments in the British Army, which poor Highlanders joined in large numbers in the era of the Revolutionary and [[Napoleonic Wars]] (1790–1815). Tartan had largely been abandoned by the ordinary people of the region, but in the 1820s, tartan and the [[kilt]] were adopted by members of the social elite, not just in Scotland, but across Europe.&lt;ref name="Roberts2002pp193-4"&gt;{{cite book |author=John Lenox Roberts |title=The Jacobite Wars: Scotland and the Military Campaigns of 1715 and 1745 |year=2002 |publisher=Polygon at Edinburgh |pages=193–195 |isbn=9781902930299 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sievers2007"&gt;{{cite book |author=Marco Sievers |title=The Highland Myth as an Invented Tradition of 18th and 19th Century and Its Significance for the Image of Scotland |year=2007 |publisher=GRIN Verlag |pages=22–25 |isbn=9783638816519 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The international craze for tartan, and for idealising a romanticised Highlands, was set off by the [[Ossian]] cycle,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Deidre Dawson |author2=Pierre Morère |title=Scotland and France in the Enlightenment |year=2004 |publisher=Bucknell University Press |pages=75–76 |isbn=0838755267 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Ferguson |title=The Identity of the Scottish Nation: An Historic Quest |year=1998 |publisher=Edinburgh University Press |page=227 |isbn=0748610715 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and further popularised by the works of [[Walter Scott]]. His "staging" of the [[visit of King George IV to Scotland]] in 1822 and the king's wearing of tartan resulted in a massive upsurge in demand for kilts and tartans that could not be met by the Scottish woollen industry. Individual clan tartans were largely designated in this period and they became a major symbol of Scottish identity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Norman C Milne |title=Scottish Culture and Traditions |year=2010 |publisher=Paragon Publishing |page=138 |isbn=1899820795 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This "Highlandism", by which all of Scotland was identified with the culture of the Highlands, was cemented by Queen Victoria's interest in the country, her adoption of [[Balmoral Castle|Balmoral]] as a major royal retreat, and her interest in "tartenry".&lt;ref name="Sievers2007"/&gt;

===Economy===
The Highlands before 1800 were very poor and traditional, and were not much affected by the uplift of the [[Scottish Enlightenment]] or the [[Industrial Revolution]] that was sweeping the Lowlands of Scotland. The period of the Napoleonic wars brought prosperity, optimism, and economic growth to the Highlands. The economy grew thanks to wages paid in industries such as kelping (in which [[kelp]] was burned for the useful chemicals obtained from the ashes), fisheries, and weaving, as well as large-scale infrastructure spending such as the [[Caledonian Canal]] project.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.ricksteves.com/watch-read-listen/read/articles/getting-high-on-highlands|title=Highlands Highlights in the Heart of Scotland by Rick Steves|website=www.ricksteves.com|language=en-US|access-date=2017-05-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Better source|reason=This source seems to be a travel blog by someone with no particular knowledge of the subject.|date=September 2018}} On the East Coast, farmlands were improved, and high prices for cattle brought money to the area. Service in the Army was also attractive to young men from the Highlands, who sent pay home and retired there with their army pensions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Malcolm Gray |title=The Highland economy, 1750-1850 |year=1957 |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=9780837185361 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This prosperity ended after 1815, and long-term negative factors began to undermine the economic position of the poor tenant farmers, who typically rented a few [[acre]]s, and were known as [[crofter]]s. Landowners were increasingly market-oriented in the century after 1750, and this tended to dissolve the traditional social and economic structure of the North-West Highlands and the Hebrides, causing great disruption for the crofters. The [[Highland Clearances]] and the end of the township system followed changes in land ownership and tenancy and the replacement of cattle by sheep.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.scotlandinfo.eu/scottish-highlands/|title=The Scottish Highlands|date=2015-02-27|work=Scotland Info Guide|access-date=2017-05-10|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Great Famine (Ireland)|Great Irish Famine]] of the 1840s was caused by a plant disease that reached the Highlands in 1846, causing great distress. 

The unequal concentration of land ownership remained an emotional and controversial subject, of enormous importance to the Highland economy, and eventually became a cornerstone of liberal radicalism. The poor crofters were politically powerless, and many of them turned to religion. They embraced the popularly oriented, fervently evangelical Presbyterian revival after 1800.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Thomas Martin Devine |title=The Scottish Nation |year=1999 |publisher=Penguin Books |chapter=Chapter 18 |isbn=0670888117 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Most joined the breakaway "Free Church" after 1843. This [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] movement was led by lay preachers who themselves came from the lower strata, and whose preaching was implicitly critical of the established order. The religious change energised the crofters and separated them from the landlords; it helped prepare them for their successful and violent challenge to the landlords in the 1880s through the [[Highland Land League]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=James Hunter |year=1974 |title=The Emergence of the Crofting Community: The Religious Contribution 1798–1843 |journal=Scottish Studies |volume=18 |issue= |pages=95–116 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
Violence erupted, starting on the [[Isle of Skye]], when Highland landlords cleared their lands for sheep and deer parks. It was quietened when the government stepped in, passing the [[Crofters' Holdings (Scotland) Act, 1886]] to reduce rents, guarantee fixity of tenure, and break up large estates to provide crofts for the homeless.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ian Bradley |date=Dec 1987 |title='Having and Holding' - The Highland Land War of the 1880s |journal=History Today |volume=37 |issue=12 |pages=23–28 |url=http://www.historytoday.com/ian-bradley/having-and-holding-highland-land-war-1880s |accessdate=8 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This contrasted with the [[Irish Land War]] under way at the same time, where the Irish were intensely politicised through roots in Irish nationalism, while political dimensions were limited. In 1885 three Independent Crofter candidates were elected to Parliament, which listened to their pleas. The results included explicit security for the Scottish smallholders; the legal right to bequeath tenancies to descendants; and the creation of a Crofting Commission. The Crofters as a political movement faded away by 1892, and the [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal Party]] gained their votes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=Ewen A. Cameron |date=June 2005 |title=Communication or Separation? Reactions to Irish Land Agitation and Legislation in the Highlands of Scotland, c. 1870–1910 |journal=English Historical Review |volume=120 |issue=487 |pages=633–66 |doi=10.1093/ehr/cei124}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Religion===
[[File:Loch Long.jpg|thumb|[[Loch Long]]]]
The [[Scottish Reformation]] achieved partial success in the Highlands. Roman Catholicism remained strong in some areas, owing to remote locations and the efforts of [[Franciscan]] missionaries from Ireland, who regularly came to celebrate [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]]. Although the presence of Roman Catholicism has faded, there remain significant Catholic strongholds within the Highlands and Islands such as [[Moidart]] and [[Morar]] on the mainland and [[South Uist]] and [[Barra]] in the southern Outer Hebrides. 
The remoteness of the region and the lack of a Gaelic-speaking clergy undermined the missionary efforts of the established church. The later 18th century saw somewhat greater success, owing to the efforts of the [[Scottish SPCK|SSPCK]] missionaries and to the disruption of traditional society after the [[Battle of Culloden]] in 1746. In the 19th century, the evangelical Free Churches, which were more accepting of Gaelic language and culture, grew rapidly, appealing much more strongly than did the established church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=George Robb |year=1990 |title=Popular Religion and the Christianisation of the Highlands in the Eighteenth and Nineteenth Centuries |journal=Journal of Religious History |volume=16 |issue=1 |pages= 18–34 |doi=10.1111/j.1467-9809.1990.tb00647.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

For the most part, however, the Highlands are considered predominantly Protestant, loyal to the [[Church of Scotland]]. In contrast to the Catholic southern islands, the northern [[Outer Hebrides]] islands (Lewis, Harris and North Uist) have an exceptionally high proportion of their population belonging to the Protestant [[Free Church of Scotland (post 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]] or the [[Free Presbyterian Church of Scotland]]. The [[Outer Hebrides]] have been described as the last bastion of [[Calvinism]] in Britain&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2006/apr/10/religion.world |title=Fury at ferry crossing on Sabbath |date=10 April 2006 |author=Gerard Seenan |publisher=The Guardian |accessdate=8 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and the Sabbath remains widely observed. Inverness and the surrounding area has a majority Protestant population, with most locals belonging to either [[Church of Scotland|The Kirk]] or the [[Free Church of Scotland (post 1900)|Free Church of Scotland]]. The church maintains a noticeable presence within the area, with church attendance notably higher than in other Scottish cities. Religion continues to play an important role in Highland culture, with Sabbath observance still widely practised, particularly in the Hebrides.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-scotland-highlands-islands-12847619 |title=Battle looms in Outer Hebrides over Sabbath opening |date=29 March 2011 |last=Cook |first=James |publisher=BBC News |accessdate=3 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Historical geography==
[[File:Inverness Ness&amp;Castle 15751.JPG|thumb|right|[[Inverness]], the administrative centre and traditional capital of the Highlands]]
[[File:Allt a' Mhuilinn.JPG|thumb|right|[[Ben Nevis]] from the path to the CIC Hut alongside the Allt a' Mhuilinn]]
In traditional Scottish [[geography]], the Highlands refers to that part of Scotland north-west of the [[Highland Boundary Fault]], which crosses mainland Scotland in a near-straight line from [[Helensburgh]] to [[Stonehaven]]. However the flat coastal lands that occupy parts of the counties of [[Nairnshire]], [[Morayshire]], [[Banffshire]] and [[Aberdeenshire (historic)|Aberdeenshire]] are often excluded as they do not share the distinctive geographical and cultural features of the rest of the Highlands. The north-east of [[Caithness]], as well as [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]], are also often excluded from the Highlands, although the [[Hebrides]] are usually included. The Highland area, as so defined, differed from the [[Scottish Lowlands|Lowlands]] in language and tradition, having preserved [[Gaels|Gaelic]] speech and customs centuries after the [[anglicisation]] of the latter; this led to a growing perception of a divide, with the cultural distinction between Highlander and Lowlander first noted towards the end of the 14th century. In [[Aberdeenshire]], the boundary between the Highlands and the Lowlands is not well defined. There is a stone beside the [[A93 road]] near the village of [[Dinnet]] on [[River Dee, Aberdeenshire|Royal Deeside]] which states 'You are now in the Highlands', although there are areas of Highland character to the east of this point.

A much wider definition of the Highlands is that used by the [[Scotch Whisky]] industry. [[Highland Single Malts]] are produced at distilleries north of an imaginary line between [[Dundee]] and [[Greenock]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotch-whisky.org.uk/understanding-scotch/whisky-regions-tours/ |title=Whisky Regions &amp; Tours |publisher=Scotch Whisky Association |accessdate=8 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; thus including all of [[Aberdeenshire]] and [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]].

[[Inverness]] is traditionally regarded as the capital of the Highlands,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scotland-inverness.co.uk/inverness.htm |title=Inverness: Capital of the Scottish Highlands |publisher=Internet Guide to Scotland |accessdate=8 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although less so in the Highland parts of [[Aberdeenshire]], [[Angus, Scotland|Angus]], [[Perthshire]] and [[Stirlingshire]] which look more to [[Aberdeen]], [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]], [[Dundee]] and [[Stirling]] as their commercial centres. Under some of the wider definitions in use, [[Aberdeen]] could be considered the largest city in the Highlands, although it does not share the recent Gaelic cultural history typical of the Highlands proper.

===Highland Council area===
The [[Highland Council]] area, created as one of the local government [[Subdivisions of Scotland|regions of Scotland]], has been a [[unitary authority|unitary council]] area since 1996. The council area excludes a large area of the southern and eastern Highlands, and the [[Western Isles]], but includes [[Caithness]]. ''Highlands'' is sometimes used, however, as a name for the council area, as in ''[[Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service]]''. ''[[Northern Scotland|Northern]]'', as in ''[[Northern Constabulary]]'', is also used to refer to the area covered by the fire and rescue service. This area consists of the Highland council area and the [[Island council areas of Scotland|island council areas]] of [[Orkney]], [[Shetland]] and the Western Isles.

Highland Council signs in the [[Pass of Drumochter]], between [[Glen Garry]] and [[Dalwhinnie]], say "Welcome to the Highlands".

===Highlands and Islands===

Much of the Highlands area overlaps the [[Highlands and Islands]] area. An [[Scottish Parliament constituencies and regions|electoral region]] called ''[[Highlands and Islands (Scottish Parliament electoral region)|Highlands and Islands]]'' is used in elections to the [[Scottish Parliament]]: this area includes [[Orkney]] and [[Shetland]], as well as the Highland Council local government area, the [[Western Isles]] and most of the [[Argyll and Bute]] and [[Moray]] local government areas. ''Highlands and Islands'' has, however, different meanings in different contexts. It means Highland (the local government area), Orkney, Shetland, and the Western Isles in ''[[Highlands and Islands Fire and Rescue Service]]''. ''[[Northern Scotland|Northern]]'', as in ''[[Northern Constabulary]]'', refers to the same area as that covered by the fire and rescue service.

===Historical crossings===
There have been [[trackway]]s from the Lowlands to the Highlands since [[prehistoric]] times. Many traverse the [[Mounth]], a spur of mountainous land that extends from the higher inland range to the [[North Sea]] slightly north of [[Stonehaven]]. The most well-known and historically important trackways are the [[Causey Mounth]], [[Elsick Mounth]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.megalithic.co.uk/article.php?sid=18037 |title=Elsick Mounth - Ancient Trackway in Scotland in Aberdeenshire |date=22 November 2007 |author=C Michael Hogan |publisher=The Megalithic Portal |accessdate=8 March 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Cryne Corse Mounth]] and [[Cairnamounth]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ads.ahds.ac.uk/catalogue/adsdata/arch-352-1/dissemination/pdf/vol_063/63_102_138.pdf |title=The Early Castles of Mar |date=10 December 1928 |author=W. Douglas Simpson |publisher= Proceedings of the Society |accessdate=8 March 2013 }}{{dead link|date=December 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Courier delivery===
Although most of the Highlands is geographically on the British mainland, it is somewhat less accessible than the rest of Britain; thus most UK couriers categorise it separately, alongside [[Northern Ireland]], the [[Isle of Man]], and other offshore islands. They thus charge additional fees for delivery to the Highlands, or exclude the area entirely. Whilst the physical remoteness from the largest population centres inevitably leads to higher transit cost, there is confusion and consternation over the scale of the fees charged and the effectiveness of their communication,&lt;ref name="CABcouriers"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cas.org.uk/news/3000-angry-scots-respond-cab-survey-rural-delivery-charges|title=3,000 angry Scots respond to CAB survey on rural delivery charges |date=25 January 2012 |publisher=2012 [[The Scottish Association of Citizens Advice Bureaux]] - Citizens Advice Scotland (Scottish charity SC016637) |accessdate=31 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the use of the word Mainland in their justification. Since the charges are often based on postcode areas, many far less remote areas, including some which are traditionally considered part of the lowlands, are also subject to these charges.&lt;ref name="CABcouriers"/&gt; [[Royal Mail]] is the only delivery network bound by a Universal Service Obligation to charge a uniform tariff across the UK. This, however, applies only to mail items and not larger packages which are dealt with by its [[Parcelforce]] division.

==Geology==
[[File:Liathach from Beinn Eighe.jpg|thumb|Liathach seen from [[Beinn Eighe]]. With the Munro "Top" of Stuc a' Choire Dhuibh Bhig 915 m (3,001 ft) in the foreground and the two Munro summits in the background.]]
[[File:main ridge of the cuillin in skye arp.jpg|thumb|The main ridge of the [[Cuillin]]]]
The Highlands lie to the north and west of the [[Highland Boundary Fault]], which runs from [[Isle of Arran|Arran]] to [[Stonehaven]]. This part of Scotland is largely composed of ancient rocks from the [[Cambrian]] and [[Precambrian]] periods which were [[Tectonic uplift|uplifted]] during the later [[Caledonian Orogeny]]. Smaller formations of [[Lewisian complex|Lewisian gneiss]] in the northwest are up to 3 billion years old. The overlying rocks of the [[Torridonian|Torridon Sandstone]] form mountains in the [[Torridon Hills]] such as [[Liathach]] and [[Beinn Eighe]] in [[Wester Ross]].

These foundations are interspersed with many [[igneous]] intrusions of a more recent age, the remnants of which have formed mountain [[massif]]s such as the [[Cairngorms]] and the [[Cuillin]] of [[Skye]]. A significant exception to the above are the fossil-bearing beds of [[Old Red Sandstone]] found principally along the [[Moray Firth]] coast and partially down the Highland Boundary Fault. The [[Jurassic]] beds found in isolated locations on [[Skye]] and [[Applecross]] reflect the complex underlying geology. They are the original source of much [[North Sea oil]]. The [[Great Glen]] is formed along a [[transform fault]] which divides the [[Grampian Mountains]] to the southeast from the [[Northwest Highlands]].&lt;ref name=Keay&gt;{{cite book |author=John Keay, Julia Keay |title=Collins Encyclopaedia of Scotland |year=1994 |publisher=HarperCollins |isbn=9780007103539 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=William Hutchison Murray |title=The islands of Western Scotland: the Inner and Outer Hebrides |year=1973 |publisher=Eyre Methuen |isbn= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The entire region was covered by ice sheets during the [[Pleistocene]] ice ages, save perhaps for a few [[nunatak]]s. The complex [[geomorphology]] includes incised valleys and [[loch]]s carved by the action of mountain streams and ice, and a [[topography]] of irregularly distributed mountains whose summits have similar heights above sea-level, but whose bases depend upon the amount of [[denudation]] to which the plateau has been subjected in various places.

==Early life and education==
Sonja Boehmer-Christiansen was born in [[Dresden]], [[East Germany]].&lt;ref name=hullarchive/&gt;&lt;ref name=ogel/&gt; In 1956, she moved to [[Adelaide]], South Australia, where she obtained a BA with Honours in [[Geomorphology]] from [[Adelaide University]] while also studying climatology, geology, physical geography and German literature.&lt;ref name=ogel/&gt;&lt;ref name=bc1982&gt;{{cite journal | last = Boehmer-Christiansen | first = Sonja | title = The scientific basis of marine pollution control | journal = [[Marine Policy]] | volume = 6 | issue = 1 | pages = 2–10 | publisher = [[Elsevier]] | doi = 10.1016/0308-597X(82)90038-0 | date = January 1982 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1016/0308-597X(82)90038-0 | ref = harv | postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=cru26&gt;{{cite web | last=Boehmer-Christiansen|first= Sonja | date=February 2010 | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/memo/climatedata/uc2602.htm | title=Memorandum submitted by Dr Sonja Boehmer-Christiansen (CRU 26) | publisher=[[Parliament of the United Kingdom|UK Parliament]] | accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=hoc&gt;{{cite web | url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/cm200910/cmselect/cmsctech/387/387ii.pdf | title=The disclosure of climate data from the Climatic Research Unit at the University of East Anglia | volume=II | page=124 | date=24 March 2010 | publisher=[[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] | accessdate=3 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; She moved again to England in 1969 and later attended the [[University of Sussex]] where she first obtained an MA followed by a DPhil in International Relations in 1981.&lt;ref name=hullarchive/&gt;&lt;ref name=bc1982/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Boehmer-Christiansen|first= Sonja A. | url=http://www.springerlink.com/content/74117811717l3360/ | title=Emerging international principles of environmental protection and their impact on Britain | journal=The Environmentalist | volume=10 | issue=2 | year=1990 | page=95 | doi=10.1007/bf02244387}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her doctoral thesis was titled, ''Limits to the international control of marine pollution''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Boehmer-Christiansen|first= S.A. | url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/limits-to-the-international-control-of-marine-pollution/oclc/53601092 | title=Limits to the international control of marine pollution | year=1981 | publisher=University of Sussex | accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
Boehmer-Christiansen joined the [[Science and Technology Policy Research|Science and Technology Policy Research Unit (SPRU)]] at the University of Sussex in 1985, working for a decade as a Research Fellow and then later as a Visiting Fellow.&lt;ref name=hullarchive/&gt;&lt;ref name=cru26/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.sussex.ac.uk/Units/spru/publications/annualreport/1998/docs/38-39.pdf | title=SPRU Annual Report – SPRU Staff: Associate Staff – Visiting Fellows and Professors | year=1998 | page=39 | publisher=[[University of Sussex]] | accessdate=30 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since the mid-1990s she had taught environmental policy, management and politics in the Geography Department at the University of Hull.&lt;ref name=spiked/&gt;&lt;ref name=hoc/&gt; As an Emeritus Reader she still works from the University of Hull's Geography Department.&lt;ref name=hull/&gt;&lt;ref name=cru26/&gt;

==Views on Climate change==
When asked about the publication in the Spring of 2003 of a revised version of the paper at the center of the [[Soon and Baliunas controversy]], Boehmer-Christiansen said, "I'm following my political agenda -- a bit, anyway. But isn't that the right of the editor?"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Monastersky|first=Richard|title=Storm Brews Over Global Warming|journal=[[Chronicle of Higher Education]]|date=5 September 2003|url=http://chronicle.com/article/Storm-Brews-Over-Global/27779/}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Boehmer-Christiansen has been a critic of [[global climate models|climate models]] saying they are based on data that cannot be verified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.theage.com.au/articles/2004/08/24/1093246516150.html | title=Tuvalu's tides divide scientists | publisher=[[The Age]] | date=25 August 2004 | accessdate=29 June 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
In 2006, she signed an open letter to Canadian Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] urging him to open the [[Kyoto Protocol]] to debate by holding balanced, comprehensive public-consultation sessions on the Canadian government's climate change plans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/financialpost/story.html?id=3711460e-bd5a-475d-a6be-4db87559d605 | title=Open Kyoto to debate – An open letter to Prime Minister Stephen Harper | publisher=[[National Post]] | date=11 April 2006 | accessdate=1 July 2012 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120512140810/http://www.canada.com/nationalpost/financialpost/story.html?id=3711460e-bd5a-475d-a6be-4db87559d605 | archivedate=12 May 2012 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She describes herself as agnostic on whether humans are causing [[global warming]], and believes its negative aspects to be politically exaggerated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.fcpp.org/publication.php/3348 | title=Conversations From the Frotier with Sonja Boehmer-Christiansen, Geomorphologist | publisher=Frontier Centre for Public Policy | date=29 June 2010 | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110726050446/http://www.fcpp.org/publication.php/3348|archivedate=26 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Third-party views==
According to [[Fred Pearce]], Boehmer-Christiansen is a [[Environmental skepticism|sceptic]] about [[acid rain]] and [[global warming]] and calls the science reports produced by the [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] "political constructs."&lt;ref name="Pearce"&gt;[[Fred Pearce|Pearce, Fred]], ''The Climate Files: The Battle for the Truth about Global Warming'', (2010) [[Guardian Books]], {{ISBN|978-0-85265-229-9}}, p. XIV.&lt;/ref&gt;

''The Guardian'' reported that Boehmer-Christiansen published – against the recommendations of a [[peer review|reviewer]] – a paper in ''[[Energy &amp; Environment]]'' claiming that the Sun is made of iron.&lt;ref name=guardian2011&gt;{{cite news | last=Barley|first= Shanta | url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2011/feb/25/real-climate-libel-threat | title=Real Climate faces libel suit| publisher=[[The Guardian]] | date=25 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last=Manuel | first=Oliver K. | url=http://multi-science.metapress.com/content/v3600623g8txh577/ | archive-url=https://archive.is/20130128141051/http://multi-science.metapress.com/content/v3600623g8txh577/ | dead-url=yes | archive-date=2013-01-28 | title=Earth's Heat Source – The Sun | journal=[[Energy &amp; Environment]] | volume=20 | issue=1–2 | pages=131–144 | year=2009 | doi=10.1260/095830509787689178 | arxiv=0905.0704 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Theodolite measurement on Ruapehu volcano.jpg|thumb|300px|alt= refer to caption|A [[vulcanologist]] takes theodolite measurements on the crater lake of [[Mt Ruapehu]].]]
[[Surveying]] in [[Australia]] and [[New Zealand]] is [[triangulation]]-based. As both countries were colonised by Great Britain during the same period of history, their survey systems share many similarities. Although they inherited the title deed system from the [[United Kingdom]], a distinctive feature is the [[Torrens System]], where [[real estate]] records are held in a central deposit and guaranteed by the state.

==Early history==
The first accurate mapping of both countries was compiled during the voyages of Captain Cook. Cook's experience in creating nautical charts of the eastern seaboard of Canada was an important factor in his appointment as captain of the voyage observing the transit of Venus. As he sailed the coastlines, he charted the bays and coastlines.

==Survey system of Australia==
Most states appointed surveyors-general early in their history. These officials were responsible for setting up reliable systems to record land purchases and claims. The current Australian survey system is the geocentric datum of Australia, established in 1994.&lt;ref name="Geocentric Datum Australia"&gt;{{cite web |title=Geocentric Datum of Australia (GDA) |url=http://www.ga.gov.au/scientific-topics/positioning-navigation/geodesy/geodetic-datums/gda|website=Geoscience Australia|accessdate=5 October 2015|language=English}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was adopted nationally on 1 January 2000.&lt;ref name="ICSM - GDA94"&gt;{{cite web|title=ICSM - GDA94|url=http://www.icsm.gov.au/gda/|website=ICSM|publisher=ICSM|accessdate=30 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Surveying is regulated at a federal level by Geoscience Australia.&lt;ref name="Geosci Aust History"&gt;{{cite web |title=Our History|url=http://www.ga.gov.au/about/who-we-are/history|website=Geoscience Australia|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Initially surveys were conducted using magnetic bearings. Later measurements were made on county arbitrary meridians, where surveys in each county were based off an initial point determined by government surveyors. In 1966, the first nationwide system, the Australian geodetic datum (AGD) was established.&lt;ref name="QLD Govt"&gt;{{cite web|title=Geodetic Datum|url=https://www.dnrm.qld.gov.au/mapping-data/maps/history/surveying/geodetic-datum|website=Department of Natural Resources And Mines|publisher=Queensland Government|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early exploration===
{{main|European exploration of Australia}}

Early surveying efforts concentrated on finding suitable town sites. Many towns in Australia were established by dividing a suitable site into small plots of land that were sold to English residents who then emigrated. Other exploration expeditions were made to the interior in an attempt to find fertile land.&lt;ref name=Tweedie&gt;{{cite web|last1=Tweedie|first1=Graham|title=A TRIBUTE TO SURVEYORS / EXPLORERS OF 19TH CENTURY AUSTRALIA|url=http://www.fig.net/resources/proceedings/fig_proceedings/fig2010/papers/ts05f/ts05f_tweedie_4084.pdf|website=FIG|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===New South Wales===
The first attempts to regulate surveying in New South Wales was in 1836. In 1876, use of the [[circumferentor]] was prohibited. The theodolite supplanted it as a more accurate measurer of angles.&lt;ref name=Smith-NSW&gt;{{cite web|last1=Smith|first1=E|title=A Brief History Of Surveying In NSW|url=http://www.dohertysmith.com.au/blog/a-brief-history-of-surveying-in-nsw/|website=Doherty Smith &amp; Associates|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Torrens system was introduced in 1862 by the Real Property Act.&lt;ref name="Timeline of Land Ownership"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Riley|first1=Carole|title=Land Ownership Timeline in New South Wales|url=http://heritagegenealogy.com.au/blog/land-ownership-timeline/}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous system of registering deeds is now known as the "old system".

===Western Australia===
A fully qualified surveyor in Western Australia is known as a licensed surveyor. The title is administered by the Land Surveyors Licensing Board of Western Australia.

==Survey system of New Zealand==
===History===
Prior to European colonisation, New Zealand was divided into territories of tribes (Iwi) and subtribes (hapu). Boundaries were defined by landmarks which were remembered in chants and oral tradition.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Ch12"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Winmill|first1=R.H.|editor1-last=Baldwin|editor1-first=J.|title=Law For Surveyors|date=1997|publisher=New Zealand Institute Of Surveyors/University Of Otago|chapter=12 - Maori Land Surveys}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Phillips&gt;{{cite book|last1=Taonui|first1=Rāwiri|editor1-last=Phillips|editor1-first=Jock|title=Māori peoples of New Zealand = Ngā iwi o Aotearoa.|date=2006|publisher=D. Bateman|location=Auckland|isbn=978-1-86953-622-0|pages=111–112|edition=repr.|chapter=16 Ngāpuhi|quote=Contains an example of a chant describing an Iwi's lands.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Land was held by customary possession, gifted, or by conquest and occupation.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Ch12"/&gt;

Sales of land to European colonists prior to 1840 were not regulated. Disputes arose mainly in areas where tribal possession was unclear.

Following the [[Treaty of Waitangi]] in 1840, all lands of New Zealand came under the dominion of the British crown. The treaty allowed the tribes possession of their customary lands. Europeans wanting to purchase land negotiated through a government commission. If negotiations were successful, the applicant was given a crown grant that gave them ownership under British law. The purchases prior to 1840 were known as old land claims and required to go through the same process. Many of these claims were reduced in size from the original agreements.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Ch4"&gt;{{cite book |last1=Lee |first1=L.P. |last2=Adam |first2=R.S. |editor1-last=Baldwin|editor1-first=J.|title=Law For Surveyors|date=1997|publisher=New Zealand Institute Of Surveyors/University Of Otago|chapter=4 - History of the New Zealand Survey System}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The position of surveyor-general was created in the royal instructions of 1840. The first regulations for surveying were established in 1842, when surveyors were required to deposit their licenses with the surveyor general's office to be returned upon completion of a survey. In 1852, [[Provinces of New Zealand|provinces]] were established and each established a survey department. These were often underfunded and most failed to systemise surveys in their territory, making boundaries unreliable because of gaps and overlaps between abutting surveys. Some small triangulation networks were established, and some cities established survey control points on routes known as standard traverses that surveyors could use as a basis for local surveys. In [[Otago Province|Otago]], true north was determined at six points throughout the province. Local surveys could be linked to these points so that their angle measurements were consistent throughout the district. The districts were known as meridional circuits, a term that has persisted in New Zealand surveying. &lt;ref name="Baldwin Ch4"/&gt;

In 1875 Major H S Palmer of the Ordnance Survey of Great Britain presented a damning report on the state of the survey system to the [[New Zealand Parliament]]. He recommended that a unified map projection was adopted and a single system of reference points was established across the country. In 1876, the provinces were abolished and  the survey departments were combined.&lt;ref name=LINZ-whakapapa&gt;{{cite web|title=LINZ/Our organization/Our Whakapapa |url=http://www.linz.govt.nz/about-linz/our-organisation/our-whakapapa |website=Land Information New Zealand|accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The chief surveyor of the Otago province, [[John Turnbull Thomson]], was made surveyor-general of the new government survey department. Thompson established meridional circuits throughout the country as well as reorganising the way land records were identified and recorded. By 1880, the small original triangulation networks had been extended and joined throughout New Zealand.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Ch4"/&gt;

====Geodetic surveys====

In the years following Major Palmer's report, triangulation had been extended throughout New Zealand, but accuracy had been found wanting. It was not until 1921 that Surveyor-General W.T. Neill began work on a system that would create accurate reference points throughout New Zealand. In 1923, the first baseline was measured near [[Kaingaroa, Northland|Kaingaroa]]. From 1930 onward, observations were made at night to improve accuracy. The longest observation was {{convert|120|km}} across [[Cook Strait]]. Work continued through World War II as the project was allowed topographical maps for military use to be quickly compiled. The last fieldwork was completed in early 1949, and the system became known as the New Zealand Geodetic Datum 1949. &lt;ref name="Baldwin Ch4" /&gt;

The 1949 datum was updated in 2000. To ease [[Global Positioning System|GPS]] measurement the new system was slightly shifted to become geocentric (the origin point of the system coincides with the centre of the Earth). It was also designed to be semi-dynamic, to cope better with seismic movement. This system is called the New Zealand Geodetic Datum 2000, and includes the NZ Transverse Mercator projection that topographical maps are published in.&lt;ref name=WITWAW&gt;{{cite web|last1=Jones|first1=A|last2=Blick|first2=G|title=Where In The World Are We|url=http://www.linz.govt.nz/system/files_force/media/file-attachments/witwaw.pdf?download=1&amp;download=1|website=Land Information New Zealand|accessdate=13 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These geodetic activities are responsible for the ubiquitous trig stations that reside mostly at the top of many hills throughout New Zealand.

===Current system===
[[Cadastral surveying]] in New Zealand is governed by the Cadastral Survey Act 2002, which defines legal bodies that deal with aspects of the profession. The act devolves power to create specific regulations to the surveyor-general, who periodically issues the surveyor-general's rules for cadastral surveys. The Land Transfer Act 1952 also influences the way surveys are done.

The [[Torrens title|Torrens system of land registration]] was introduced in the Land Transfer Act 1870. The act introduced a system where land title is held in a register as opposed to the previous system that registered the document containing the title information. It therefore made it unnecessary to search the history of a title, and made titles indefeasible, meaning that it cannot be claimed by persons other than the registered owner.

A separate system exists in parallel with the general land titles for land held in common by Māori as a tribe. This is controlled by the Te ture Whenua Maori (Maori Land) Act 1993. In 1980, 4.5% of New Zealand land was held in the Māori land system.&lt;ref name="Baldwin Ch12" /&gt; This does not include land held by Māori individuals in the general land system.

A surveyor who has fulfilled the requirements to legally sign subdivision plans is known as a licensed cadastral surveyor.

Construction surveying is not regulated at the state level in New Zealand. However, matters relating to surveying may require certification by a registered professional surveyor under contract law or [[Territorial authorities of New Zealand|local authority]] regulations.

Surveying in New Zealand uses whole circle (azimuth) bearings. Another oddity is the convention of writing coordinates where the northing is written before the easting, at odds with much of the rest of the world.

New Zealand Institute of Surveyors was established in 1888 after an earlier attempt in 1881.

'''Takuyo-Daisan''' is a [[guyot]] in the [[Western Pacific Ocean]] off [[Japan]]. It is {{convert|1409|m}} deep and has a square-shaped flat top surrounded by a perimeter ridge. Several other [[Seamount|seamounts]] lie nearby. 

The seamount formed as a [[volcanic island]] during the [[Cretaceous]] in the area currently occupied by [[French Polynesia]]. Subsequently [[Reef|reefs]] developed around the volcanic island and generated a [[carbonate platform]] which drowned during the [[Albian]] along with several other such platforms in the world.

== Name and research history ==
Takuyo-Daisan was formerly known as "Seiko guyot";&lt;ref name="CamoinDavies2009" /&gt; "Seiko guyot" was used even earlier for [[Takuyo-Daini]] while Takuyo-Daisan was named "Eiko".{{sfn|Vogt|Smoot|1984|p=11087}} This seamount was drilled by the [[Ocean Drilling Program]], with Site 879 located on the seamount.{{sfn|Arnaud Vanneau|Premoli Silva|1995|p=199}}

== Geography and geology ==
Takuyo-Daisan lies southeast of the city of [[Yokohama]], Japan.{{sfn|Haggerty|van Waasbergen|1995|p=842}} It is the easternmost seamount in the "Seiko" cluster{{sfn|Haggerty|van Waasbergen|1995|p=841}} of the [[Japanese Seamounts]].{{sfn|Arnaud Vanneau|Premoli Silva|1995|p=199}} The [[Boso Triple Junction]] lies only {{convert|200|km}} away from the seamount.{{sfn|Vogt|Smoot|1984|p=11087}}

=== Local ===
Takuyo-Daisan is a [[guyot]]{{sfn|Rack|Lawyer|Gee|1995|p=973}} that rises to a minimum depth of {{convert|1409|m}}{{sfn|Vogt|Smoot|1984|p=11088}} and is capped by an approximately square-shaped surface platform at about {{convert|1600|m}} depth{{sfn|Haggerty|van Waasbergen|1995|p=845}} which has a surface area of about {{convert|86|km2}}.{{sfn|Vogt|Smoot|1984|p=11088}} Depressions up to {{convert|75|m}} deep cover the flat top. The top is surrounded by a {{convert|0.6|-|1|km}} wide and up to {{convert|110|m}} high ridge, especially on the northeastern and southern sides.{{sfn|Haggerty|van Waasbergen|1995|p=843}} It may be either a [[bioherm]] or a [[karst]] landform. A {{convert|100|m}}{{sfn|Ogg|Camoin|Jansa|1995|p=361}}-{{convert|110|m}} high structure may be part of the old volcanic edifice;{{sfn|Rack|Lawyer|Gee|1995|p=973}} the interface between the carbonate platform and the volcanic basement has a sloping aspect.{{sfn|Haggerty|Premoli Silva|1995|p=943}}

Away from the platform, the seamount has steep slopes probably formed by short [[lava flow]]s{{sfn|Rack|Lawyer|Gee|1995|p=973}} that rise {{convert|4.3|km}} above the seafloor.{{sfn|Larson|Erba|Nakanishi|Bergersen|1995|p=915}} Channels, [[debris flow]] fronts and levees decorate its slopes.{{sfn|Vogt|Smoot|1984|p=11093}} Noticeable ridges emanate from the east-southeastern, southwestern, west-northwestern and north-northeastern corners of the seamount;{{sfn|Haggerty|van Waasbergen|1995|p=845}} they appear to be [[rift zone]]s,&lt;ref name="Sigurdsson1999" /&gt; and flank cones are found on the eastern slopes. The southern slopes feature [[Slump (geology)|slump]] deposits, and the entire seamount is surrounded by a sediment fan.{{sfn|Vogt|Smoot|1984|p=11093}} The volume of the entire seamount is about {{convert|1300|km3}}.{{sfn|Vogt|Smoot|1984|p=11090}} Two large seamounts lie west and southwest of Takuyo-Daisan with a smaller seamount between the two;&lt;ref name="Sigurdsson1999" /&gt; Takuyo-Daini is the western one and Jensen seamount the south-western one.{{sfn|Vogt|Smoot|1984|p=11093}} The seafloor underneath Takuyo-Daisan has an age of 143 million years.{{sfn|Larson|Erba|Nakanishi|Bergersen|1995|p=919}}

=== Regional ===
The [[Western Pacific Ocean]] features many [[seamount]]s with flat tops at depths of {{convert|1|-|2|km}} below sea level which are known as [[guyot]]s. They were considered to be remnants of eroded islands before [[Cretaceous]] carbonate platforms were discovered on them{{sfn|Haggerty|van Waasbergen|1995|p=841}} which resemble present-day [[atoll]]s although they do not have exactly the same properties.{{sfn|Larson|Erba|Nakanishi|Bergersen|1995|p=915}} Later similar submarine mountains were identified elsewhere in the Pacific Ocean as well. Menard 1958 suggested that the Western Pacific guyots once were part of an elevated region known as the [[Darwin Rise]], later compared to present day [[French Polynesia]].{{sfn|Haggerty|van Waasbergen|1995|p=842}}

Many of these seamounts originally formed in the [[South Pacific Ocean|South Pacific]], such as in [[French Polynesia]],{{sfn|Christie|Dieu|Gee|1995|p=495}}{{sfn|Pringle|Duncan|1995|p=553}} where a number of recent volcanoes and volcanic chains can be found.{{sfn|Christie|Dieu|Gee|1995|p=495}} The original location of Takuyo-Daisan closely matches the present-day location of the [[Society hotspot]],{{sfn|Pringle|Duncan|1995|p=548}} and together with Takuyo-Daini, Winterer Guyot and Isakov Guyot appears to form a linear volcanic chain,&lt;ref name="Koppers2003" /&gt; the Geisha guyots.{{sfn|Vogt|Smoot|1984|p=11086}}

=== Composition ===
Takuyo-Daisan has erupted [[basalt]]{{sfn|Pringle|Duncan|1995|p=549}} containing [[olivine]] and [[plagioclase]]{{sfn|Christie|Dieu|Gee|1995|p=502}} and which define an intermediary to [[tholeiitic]] [[magma]] suite.{{sfn|Christie|Dieu|Gee|1995|p=505}} Weathering of volcanic rocks has given rise to [[calcite]],{{sfn|Christie|Dieu|Gee|1995|p=502}} [[clay]]{{sfn|Ogg|Camoin|Jansa|1995|p=361}} which also contains [[coal]],{{sfn|Ogg|Camoin|Jansa|1995|p=366}} [[iddingsite]] and [[zeolite]].{{sfn|Christie|Dieu|Gee|1995|p=502}} Carbonates occur in the form of [[floatstone]], [[grainstone]], [[limestone]], [[packstone]], [[oncoid]]s, [[peloid]]s, [[rudstone]] and [[wackestone]];{{sfn|Haggerty|van Waasbergen|1995|p=867}} the limestone is of [[reef]]al origin.[[Hypersthene]] [[andesite]] samples taken from Takuyo-Daisan were probably brought there by [[ice raft]]ing{{sfn|Heezen|Matthews|Catalano|Natland|1973|p=693}} as no such rocks have ever been found on this kind of volcanic island.{{sfn|Heezen|Matthews|Catalano|Natland|1973|p=684}}

== Geologic history ==

=== Volcanism ===
Obtaining reliable [[radiometric dating|radiometric ages]] from Takuyo-Daisan has been difficult; the most reliable age has been obtained from nearby Takuyo-Daini, 118.4 ± 1.8 million years ago.{{sfn|Pringle|Duncan|1995|p=553}} From this date an age of 119.0 ± 1.8 million years ago has been inferred for Takuyo-Daisan.{{sfn|Larson|Erba|Nakanishi|Bergersen|1995|p=927}} A more recent date from Takuyo-Daisan is 117.5 ± 1.1 million years ago.&lt;ref name="Koppers2003" /&gt; The seamount formed at 9{{sfn|Haggerty|Premoli Silva|1995|p=942}}-7 degrees south from the equator.{{sfn|Haggerty|Premoli Silva|1995|p=941}}

Volcanic activity formed [[breccia]], [[lava flow]]s with thicknesses of about {{convert|1|m}}{{sfn|Ogg|Camoin|Jansa|1995|p=366}} and volcanic sediments. The volcanic rocks were subject to [[weathering]], forming over {{convert|20|m}} thick soils.{{sfn|Ogg|Camoin|Jansa|1995|p=361}} [[Phreatomagmatic]] deposits{{sfn|Haggerty|Premoli Silva|1995|p=943}} and rocks interpreted as [[peperite]] have also been found,{{sfn|Pringle|Duncan|1995|p=549}} implying that some lava flows may have interacted with wet soils as they were emplaced. Takuyo-Daisan at this time might have been an{{sfn|Ogg|Camoin|Jansa|1995|p=366}} at least {{convert|138|m}}{{sfn|Larson|Erba|Nakanishi|Bergersen|1995|p=929}} and possibly as much as {{convert|900|m}} high{{sfn|Vogt|Smoot|1984|p=11088}} [[tropical]] [[volcanic island]] with [[marsh]]es that were inhabited by [[Bioturbation|bioturbatory]] organisms.{{sfn|Ogg|Camoin|Jansa|1995|p=366}}

=== Carbonate sedimentation ===
[[Carbonate]] sedimentation at Takyuo-Daisan lasted from the [[Aptian]] to the [[Albian]] (based on [[foraminifera]]l [[fossil]]s{{sfn|Arnaud Vanneau|Premoli Silva|1995|p=211}}) and led to the deposition of about {{convert|150|m}}&lt;ref name="Flood1999" /&gt;-{{convert|200|m}} of carbonate sediment.{{sfn|Arnaud Vanneau|Premoli Silva|1995|p=199}} Carbonate sedimentation took place while the initial volcanic edifice was still emergent, similar to present-day [[Chuuk Lagoon|Truk]], [[Micronesia]];{{sfn|Ogg|Camoin|Jansa|1995|p=371}} this resulted in [[terrigenous]] sedimentation in the carbonates.{{sfn|Ogg|Camoin|Jansa|1995|p=366}} The total duration of carbonate sedimentation is about 15 million years,{{sfn|Haggerty|Premoli Silva|1995|p=946}} {{convert|3|m}} thick distinct sequences in the carbonate sediments may be correlated to [[Milankovich cycle]]s.{{sfn|Ogg|Camoin|Jansa|1995|p=373}}

The carbonate platform at Takuyo-Daisan featured both barrier shoals and [[lagoon]]al environments.{{sfn|Ogg|Camoin|Jansa|1995|p=366}} Biogenic [[mound]]s grew at the margin of the platform.&lt;ref name="Jansa1995" /&gt; Redeposition of carbonate sediments led to the formation of sandy [[shoal]]s{{sfn|Ogg|Camoin|Jansa|1995|p=370}} which formed the later perimeter ridge.{{sfn|Haggerty|Premoli Silva|1995|p=945}} Overall the environment of the platform was a warm [[Tethys Ocean|Tethyan]] environment.&lt;ref name="Masse1995" /&gt;

[[Alga]]e{{efn|Such as ''[[Marinella]]'', ''[[Neomeris]]'', ''[[Pycnoporidium]]'', ''[[Terquemella]]'' and ''[[Zittelina]]''.&lt;ref name="Masse1995" /&gt;}}{{sfn|Arnaud Vanneau|Premoli Silva|1995|p=212}} including [[algal mat]]s,{{sfn|Ogg|Camoin|Jansa|1995|p=365}} [[bivalve]]s, [[coral]]s,{{sfn|Arnaud Vanneau|Premoli Silva|1995|p=212}} [[cyanobacteria]],{{sfn|Ogg|Camoin|Jansa|1995|p=365}} [[echinoid]]s, [[foraminifera]]{{efn|[[Genera]] include ''[[Arenobulimina]]'', ''[[Axiopolina]]'', ''[[Bdelloidina]]'', ''[[Cuneolina]]'', ''[[Daxia]]'', ''[[Debarina]]'', ''[[Fischerina]]'', ''[[Istriloculina]]'', ''[[Lituola]]'', ''[[Nezzazata]]'', ''[[Novalesia]]'', ''[[Orbitolina]]'', ''[[Paracoskinolina]]'', ''[[Trocholina]]'', and ''[[Vercorsella]]''.{{sfn|Arnaud Vanneau|Premoli Silva|1995|pp=202-210}}}},{{sfn|Arnaud Vanneau|Premoli Silva|1995|p=212}} [[mollusc]]s,{{sfn|Haggerty|van Waasbergen|1995|p=867}} [[nannofossil]]-forming species{{sfn|Erba|Premoli Silva|Watkins|1995|p=164}} and [[rudist]]s inhabited the carbonate platform, and [[arthropod]]s and [[wood]]s have been found in the oldest carbonate deposits. The fauna of Takuyo-Daisan was not particularly diverse, probably because the seamount was located close to the paleoequator and away from the [[Tethys Ocean|Tethyan]] margin that many species found at Takuyo-Daisan originate from.{{sfn|Arnaud Vanneau|Premoli Silva|1995|p=212}} 

=== Drowning and post-drowning evolution ===
The drowning of the carbonate platform at Takuyo-Daisan has been attributed to different causes. A large [[transgression (geology)|transgression]] took place in the late [[Albian]] and may have caused the drowning. In other guyots nutrient excess has been implicated but there is no evidence of such at Takuyo-Daisan.{{sfn|Ogg|Camoin|Jansa|1995|p=374}} Other factors may include hostile conditions close to the equator and unfavourable changes of the geomorphology of the platform at the time of its drowning.{{sfn|Ogg|Camoin|Jansa|1995|p=375}} The drowning of the Takuyo-Daisan platform was simultaneous to the drowning of carbonate platforms elsewhere around the world and may have been caused by tectonically-induced sea level fluctuations.&lt;ref name="Winterer1995" /&gt;

After cessation of the platform activity, [[manganese]] crusts{{sfn|Haggerty|van Waasbergen|1995|p=867}} and [[chalk]]s later modified by [[phosphate]] developed on exposed rocks. During the [[Neogene]], [[Pelagic sediment#Oozes|oozes]],{{sfn|Ogg|Camoin|Jansa|1995|p=361}} terrigenous sediments,{{sfn|Rack|Lawyer|Gee|1995|p=981}} wind-borne material such as [[pollen]]{{sfn|Fenner|1995|p=62}} and [[volcanic ash]] from the approaching [[Volcanoes of Japan|Japanese volcanic arc]] accumulated on Takuyo-Daisan.{{sfn|Ogg|Camoin|Jansa|1995|p=361}}

Presently, Takuyo-Daisan lies in a region of high [[plankton]] productivity which has led to a high [[diatom]]{{efn|Diatom [[genera]] include ''[[Asterolampra]]'',  ''[[Asteromphalus]]'', ''[[Chaetoceros]]'', ''[[Cyclotella]]'', ''[[Neodenticula]]'', ''[[Nitzschia]]'', ''[[Odontella]]'', ''[[Paralia (genus)|Paralia]]'', ''[[Rhizosolenia]]'', ''[[Stephanopyxis]]'', ''[[Thalassionema]]'', ''[[Thalassiosira]]'', ''[[Thalassiothrix]]'' and ''[[Xanthiopyxis]]''.{{sfn|Fenner|1995|pp=73-74}}}} deposition rate{{sfn|Fenner|1995|p=73}} as well as high sedimentation rates in general. [[Coral]]s and [[sponge]]s have been found on the seamount; [[crinoid]]s may also occur there.{{sfn|Fenner|1995|p=76}}

'''Tide tables''', sometimes called '''tide charts''', are used for [[tide|tidal prediction]] and show the daily times and levels of high and low tides, usually for a particular location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Horton |first=Jennifer |url=http://science.howstuffworks.com/environmental/earth/oceanography/tide-table.htm |title=HowStuffWorks "What are tide tables?" |publisher=Science.howstuffworks.com |date=2008-04-30 |accessdate=2012-11-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Tide heights at intermediate times (between high and low water) can be approximated by using the [[rule of twelfths]] or more accurately calculated by using a published tidal curve for the location. Tide levels are typically given relative to a low-water datum, e.g. the mean lower low water (MLLW) datum in the US.&lt;ref&gt;[https://tidesandcurrents.noaa.gov/publications/tidal_datums_and_their_applications.pdf Tidal Datums And Their Applications], NOAA Special Publication NOS CO-OPS 1, Silver Spring MD, June 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication and Scope==
Tide tables are published in various forms, such as paper-based tables and tables available on the Internet. Most tide tables are calculated and published only for major [[port]]s, called "standard ports", and only for one year — standard ports can be relatively close together or hundreds of kilometers apart. The tide times for a minor port are estimated by the tide-table user manually calculating using the published time and height differences between a standard port and the minor port.

==Dates and times==
The dates of [[spring tide]]s and [[neap tide]]s, approximately seven days apart, can be determined by the heights of the tides on the classic tide tables: a small range indicates neaps and large indicates springs. 

The cycle of tides is dependent on the phase of the moon, with the highest tides [[spring tides]] occurring near full moon and new moon. As the lunar cycle is about 29.5 days, successive tides are approximately 24/29th of an hour later each day or about 50 minutes but many other observations and considerations are required to develop accurate tide tables.  On the [[Atlantic]] coast of northwest [[Europe]], the interval between each low and high tide averages about 6 hours and 10 minutes, giving two high tides and two low tides each day, with the highest tides about 2 days after full moon.

==Calculation==
Tide prediction was long beset by the problem of laborious calculations; and in earlier times, before the use of digital computers, official tide tables were often generated by the use of a special-purpose calculating machine, the [[tide-predicting machine]].

}}&lt;/ref&gt; {{Lang-ru|Перевал Торугарт}}) is a [[mountain pass]] in the [[Tian Shan]] mountain range near the border between the [[Naryn Province]] of [[Kyrgyzstan]] and the [[Xinjiang| Xinjiang Autonomous Region]] of [[People's Republic of China|China]]. It is one of two border crossings between Kyrgyzstan and China, the other being [[Irkeshtam]], some 165&amp;nbsp;km (103&amp;nbsp;mi) to the southwest.

The scenic Lake of [[Chatyr-Kul]] lies near the pass on the Kyrgyz side. The road to [[Naryn]] and then to [[Balykshy]] and [[Bishkek]]&amp;mdash;stretching for some {{Convert|400|km|abbr=on}}&amp;mdash;is narrow and in winter often impassable due to heavy snowfall and frequent [[avalanche]]s.  On the Chinese side, the Torugart Port of Entry (吐尔尕特口岸), where travelers must clear for customs, is located about {{Convert|110|km|abbr=on}} from the pass itself in [[Ulugqat]] County of the [[Kizilsu Kirghiz Autonomous Prefecture]]. Distances from the pass to major cities are: {{Convert|110|km|abbr=on}} to [[Ulugqat]], {{Convert|165|km|abbr=on}} to [[Kashgar]], {{Convert|170|km}} to [[Artux]] and some {{Convert|1630|km|abbr=on}} to [[Urumqi]].

==History==

The pass was used since antiquity. During the [[Han dynasty]] it was under the jurisdiction of a micro-state called '''Juandu''' ({{lang|zh-hans|捐毒国}}). During the [[Tang dynasty]], the region came under Tang control as part of [[Anxi Protectorate]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

Russia and China first established a port of entry at the Torugart Pass in 1881. In 1906, Russia's Sino-Russian Transport Bank financed the construction of the road from the pass to Kashgar for 20 million rubles. In 1952, the Torugart Pass replaced the [[Irkeshtam]] Pass, which lies some {{Convert|165|km|abbr=on}} southwest, as the primary overland link between Xinjiang and the then-[[Kirghiz Soviet Socialist Republic|Soviet Kyrgyz Republic]]. The pass was closed in 1969 due to the [[Sino-Soviet Split]] and reopened again in 1983. In 1995, the Torugart Port of Entry was relocated to a lower elevation (2,000m), closer to [[Kashgar]], some {{Convert|57|km|abbr=on}} away.

The pass is open to all nationalities but clearance requires careful arrangement of transportation.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url = http://caravanistan.com/border-crossings/kyrgyzstan/torugart-pass/|title = Torugart Pass |date = |accessdate = 11 November 2015|website = Caravanistan |publisher = |last = |first = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A China-Kyrgyzstan-Uzbekistan railway going through Torugard Pass has been in the works that would connect [[Kashgar]] and the [[Ferghana Valley]] since 2012.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine

The '''Zagros Mountains''' ({{lang-fa|{{Nastaliq|کوه‌های زاگرس}}}}; [[Lurish language|Lurish]]: {{Nastaliq|کۆیَل زاگروس}}; {{lang-ku|{{Nastaliq|چیاکانی زاگرۆس}}}}) are a long mountain range in [[Iran]], [[Iraqi Kurdistan|Iraq]] and southeastern [[Turkey]]. This mountain range has a total length of {{convert|1,600|km|mile|abbr=on}}. The Zagros mountain range begins in northwestern Iran and roughly follows Iran's western border, while covering much of southeastern Turkey and northeastern Iraq. From this border region, the range roughly follows Iran's coast on the [[Persian Gulf]]. It spans the whole length of the western and southwestern [[Iranian plateau]], ending at the [[Strait of Hormuz]]. The highest point is Mount [[Zardkuh]], at {{Convert|4548|m|ft}}.

The [[Zagros fold and thrust belt]] was formed by the collision of two [[tectonic plate]]s, the [[Eurasian Plate]] and the [[Arabian Plate]].&lt;ref name="readersnatural"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Natural Wonders of the World|publisher=Reader's Digest Association, Inc|year=1980|isbn=0-89577-087-3|editor-last=Scheffel|editor-first=Richard L.|location=United States of America|pages=422-423|quote=|editor-last2=Wernet|editor-first2=Susan J.|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This collision primarily happened during the [[Miocene]] and folded the entire rocks that had been deposited from the [[Carboniferous]] to the Miocene in the [[geosyncline]] in front of the Iranian Plate. The process of collision continues to the present and as the Arabian Plate is being pushed against the Eurasian Plate, the Zagros Mountains and the [[Iranian Plateau]] are getting higher and higher. Recent [[GPS]] measurements in [[Iran]]&lt;ref&gt;Nilforoushan F., Masson F., Vernant P., Vigny C., Martinod J., Abbassi M., Nankali H., Hatzfeld D., Bayer R., Tavakoli F., Ashtiani A., Doerflinger E., Daignières M., Collard P., Chéry J., 2003. GPS network monitors the Arabia-Eurasia collision deformation in Iran, Journal of Geodesy, 77, 411–422.&lt;/ref&gt; have shown that this collision is still active and the resulting deformation is distributed non-uniformly in the country, mainly taken up in the major mountain belts like [[Alborz]] and Zagros. A relatively dense GPS network which covered the Iranian Zagros&lt;ref&gt;Hessami K., Nilforoushan F., Talbot CJ., 2006, Active deformation within the Zagros Mountains deduced from GPS measurements, Journal of the Geological Society, London, 163, 143–148.&lt;/ref&gt; also proves a high rate of deformation within the Zagros. The GPS results show that the current rate of shortening in the southeast Zagros is ~{{convert|10|mm/yr|in/yr|abbr=on}}, dropping to ~{{convert|5|mm/yr|in/yr|abbr=on}} in the northwest Zagros. The north-south [[Kazerun]] [[strike-slip fault]] divides the Zagros into two distinct zones of deformation. The GPS results also show different shortening directions along the belt, normal shortening in the southeast and oblique shortening in the northwest Zagros. The Zagros mountains were created around the time of the second ice age, which caused the tectonic collision, leading to it's uniqueness.

The sedimentary cover in the SE Zagros is deforming above a layer of rock salt (acting as a [[ductile]] [[decollement]] with a low basal [[friction]]), whereas in the NW Zagros the salt layer is missing or is very thin. This different basal friction is partly responsible for the different topographies on either side of the Kazerun fault. Higher topography and narrower zone of deformation in the NW Zagros is observed whereas in the SE, deformation was spread more and a wider zone of deformation with lower topography was formed.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Nilforoushan F, Koyi HA., Swantesson J.O.H., Talbot CJ., 2008, Effect of basal friction on the surface and volumetric strain in models of convergent settings measured by laser scanner, Journal of Structural Geology, 30, 366–379.&lt;/ref&gt; Stresses induced in the Earth's crust by the collision caused extensive folding of the preexisting layered [[sedimentary rock]]s. Subsequent erosion removed softer rocks, such as [[mudstone]] (rock formed by consolidated mud) and [[siltstone]] (a slightly coarser-grained mudstone) while leaving harder rocks, such as [[limestone]] (calcium-rich rock consisting of the remains of marine organisms) and [[dolomite]] (rocks similar to limestone containing [[calcium]] and [[magnesium]]). This differential [[erosion]] formed the linear ridges of the Zagros Mountains. The [[Sedimentary depositional environment|depositional environment]] and tectonic history of the rocks were conducive to the formation and trapping of [[petroleum]], and the Zagros region is an important area for oil production. [[Salt dome]]s and [[salt glacier]]s are a common feature of the Zagros Mountains. Salt domes are an important target for [[petroleum exploration]], as the impermeable salt frequently traps petroleum beneath other rock layers.

===Type and age of rock===
The mountains have a totally sedimentary origin and are made primarily of [[limestone]]. In the Elevated Zagros or the Higher Zagros, the [[Paleozoic]] rocks could be found mainly in the upper and higher sections of the peaks of the Zagros Mountains along the Zagros main fault. On both sides of this fault, there are [[Mesozoic]] rocks, a combination of [[Triassic]] and [[Jurassic]] rocks that are surrounded by [[Cretaceous]] rocks on both sides. The Folded Zagros (the mountains south of the Elevated Zagros and almost parallel to the main Zagros fault) is formed mainly of [[Tertiary]] rocks, with the [[Paleogene]] rocks south of the Cretaceous rocks and then the [[Neogene]] rocks south of the Paleogene rocks. The mountains are divided into many parallel sub-ranges (up to {{convert|10|or|250|km|mile|abbr=on}} wide), and orogenically have the same age as the [[Alps]]. Iran's main [[oilfield]]s lie in the western central foothills of the Zagros mountain range. The southern ranges of the [[Fars Province]] have somewhat lower summits, reaching {{convert|4000|m|mile|abbr=off}}. They contain some limestone rocks showing abundant marine fossils.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;[[File:The view of Dena from Semirom road - panoramio.jpg|thumb|Glaciers on Dena]]

==History==
Signs of early agriculture date back as far as 9000 BC to the foothills of the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;La Mediterranée, Braudel, Fernand, 1985, Flammarion, Paris&lt;/ref&gt; There were settlements that later grew into cities, eventually named [[Anshan (Persia)|Anshan]] and [[Susa]]. [[Jarmo]] is one archaeological site in this area. [[Shanidar]], where the ancient skeletal remains of [[Neanderthal]]s have been found, is another. Some of the earliest evidence of [[wine]] production has been discovered in the mountains; both the settlements of [[Hajji Firuz Tepe]] and [[Godin Tepe]] have given evidence of wine storage dating between 3500 and 5400 BC.&lt;ref&gt;Phillips, Rod. A Short History of Wine. New York: Harper Collins. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;

During early ancient times, the Zagros was the home of peoples such as the [[Kassites]], [[Gutian people|Guti]], [[Elamites]] and [[Mitanni]], who periodically invaded the [[Sumer]]ian and/or [[Akkadian Empire|Akkad]]ian cities of [[Mesopotamia]]. The mountains create a geographic barrier between the [[Mesopotamia|Mesopotamian Plain]], which is in [[Iraq]], and the [[Iranian Plateau]]. A small archive of clay tablets detailing the complex interactions of these groups in the early second millennium BC has been found at [[Tell Shemshara]] along the [[Little Zab]].&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last1=Eidem|first1=Jesper|title=The Shemshara archives 1. The letters|volume=23|year=2001|series=Historisk-Filosofiske Skrifter|location=Copenhagen|publisher=Kongelige Danske videnskabernes selskab|isbn=87-7876-245-6|last2=Læssøe|first2=Jørgen}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Tell Bazmusian]], near Shemshara, was occupied between 5000 BCE and 800 CE, although not continuously.&lt;ref name="al-soof"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Al-Soof|first1=Behnam Abu|year=1970|title=Mounds in the Rania Plain and excavations at Tell Bazmusian (1956)|journal=Sumer|volume=26|pages=65–104|issn=0081-9271}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Climate==
The mountains contain several [[ecosystem]]s. Prominent among them are the forest and [[forest steppe]] areas with a [[semi-arid climate]]. As defined by the [[World Wildlife Fund]] and used in their Wildfinder, the particular terrestrial [[ecoregion]] of the mid to high mountain area is ''Zagros Mountains forest steppe'' (PA0446). The annual [[precipitation (meteorology)|precipitation]] ranges from {{convert|400|-|800|mm|in|abbr=on}} and falls mostly in winter and spring. Winters are severe, with low temperatures often below {{convert|-25|°C|°F|abbr=on}}. The region exemplifies the continental variation of the [[Mediterranean climate]] pattern, with a snowy winter and mild, rainy spring, followed by a dry summer and autumn.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Frey |first=W. |author2=W.

=== Glaciation ===
The mountains of the East-Zagros, the Kuh-i-Jupar ({{convert|4135|m|ft|abbr=on}}), Kuh-i-Lalezar ({{convert|4374|m|ft|abbr=on}}) and Kuh-i-Hezar ({{convert|4469|m|ft|abbr=on}}) do not currently have glaciers. Only at [[Zard Kuh]] and [[Dena]] some glaciers still survive. However, before the Last Glacial Period they had been glaciated to a depth in excess of {{convert|1900|m|mile|abbr=off}}, and during the Last Glacial Period to a depth in excess of {{convert|2160|m|ft|abbr=off}}. Evidence exists of a {{convert|20|km|mile|abbr=on}} wide glacier fed along a {{convert|17|km|mile|abbr=on}} long valley dropping approximately {{convert|1600|m|ft|abbr=on}} along its length on the north side of Kuh-i-Jupar with a thickness of {{convert|350|-|550|m|ft|abbr=on}}. Under precipitation conditions comparable to the current conditions, this size of glacier could be expected to form where the annual average temperature was between {{convert|10.5|and|11.2|°C|°F|abbr=on}}, but since conditions are expected to have been dryer during the period in which this glacier was formed, the temperature must have been lower.&lt;ref&gt;Kuhle, M.

Although currently degraded through [[overgrazing]] and [[deforestation]], the Zagros region is home to a rich and complex flora. Remnants of the originally widespread [[oak]]-dominated woodland can still be found, as can the park-like [[pistachio]]/[[almond]] steppelands. The ancestors of many familiar foods, including [[wheat]], [[barley]], [[lentil]], almond, [[walnut]], pistachio, [[apricot]], [[plum]], [[pomegranate]] and [[grape]] can be found growing wild throughout the mountains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cowan|first=edited by C.

The Zagros are home to many [[threatened]] or [[endangered]] organisms, including the [[Zagros Mountains mouse-like hamster]] (''Calomyscus bailwardi''), the [[Basra reed-warbler]] (''Acrocephalus griseldis'') and the [[striped hyena]] (''Hyena hyena'').
