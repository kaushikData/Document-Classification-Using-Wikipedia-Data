'''Abandonment costs''' or '''Abandonment expenditure (ABEX)''' are costs associated with the abandonment of a business venture. 

Abandonment costs traditionally applied to the process of abandoning an under-producing or non-producing [[oil well|oil]] or [[gas well]]. In that context, it means the removal of equipment, plugging of the well with [[cement]], any environmental clean-up, etc. necessary to shut the well down. It is occasionally referred to as "Removal and Abandonment" or R &amp; A. The objective of well abandonment is to ensure that no hydrocarbons leak into surface water or into the atmosphere.  The cost of a routine abandonment of a typical well in the [[United States]] is about $5,000 (~[[Texas]] average cost in year 2000). If a well has developed a leak that allows gas to flow up the outside of the well casing, finding and correcting the leak can push the cost of abandonment beyond $100,000. Wells that have been used as injectors or have been subject to fracking operation are more likely to develop leaks because the injected substances can create channels that permit uncontrolled flow outside the casing. 

The term's application has been broadened from its original context to apply to the abandonment of other business ventures, primarily in manufacturing. It is often used in a [[cost-benefit analysis]] to determine if a marginal venture should be continued or if it is more financially beneficial to abandon the venture and plow the remaining money into something else in an attempt to recoup the losses. For example, [[General Motors]] had some abandonment costs from shutting down the [[Pontiac]] and [[Saturn Corporation|Saturn]] brands. The existence of abandonment costs in an industry implies that there is no [[free exit]] from that industry.

[[EP additives]] are used in applications such as [[transmission (mechanics)|gearboxes]], while AW additives are used with lighter loads such as [[bushing (bearing)|bushing]]s.

== Details ==
Some popular AW additives are:
* [[zinc dithiophosphate]] (ZDP)
* [[zinc dialkyl dithio phosphate]] (ZDDP), probably the most widely used&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=J_AkNu-Y1wQC&amp;pg=PA374&amp;lpg=PA374&amp;dq=antiwear+additives+oil&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=j1Gu6IBWcu&amp;sig=npKkFxW5S_mBG3om2C5yfRcIuE0&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjUi625ltbRAhVrB8AKHWvxAQc4FBDoAQhPMAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=antiwear%20additives%20oil&amp;f=false|title=Fuels and Lubricants Handbook|publisher=ASTM International|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; in formulated [[engine oil]]s, also acts as a [[corrosion inhibitor]] and [[antioxidant]]
* [[Tricresyl phosphate]] (TCP), used for high-temperature operation, often used as an AW and EP additive in turbine engine lubricants, and also in some crankcase oils and [[hydraulic fluid]]s
* [[Halocarbon]]s ([[chlorinated paraffins]]), for extreme pressure operations
* [[Glycerol mono oleate]]
* [[Stearic acid]], adhering to surfaces via reversible adsorption process under 150&amp;nbsp;°C, which limits its use to mild contact conditions.

Some formulations use [[colloid]]al [[polytetrafluorethylene|PTFE]] ([[Teflon]]), but its efficiency is controversial.

Many AW additives function as EP additives, for example [[organophosphate]]s or [[sulfur]] compounds. The mechanism of function of TCP and ZDDP is explained in [[EP additive]]s.

Under extreme pressure conditions, the performance of AW additives becomes insufficient and designated [[EP additive]]s are required.

'''The Center for Analysis and Prediction of Storms''' ('''CAPS''') was established at the [[University of Oklahoma]] in 1989 as one of the first eleven [[National Science Foundation]] Science and Technology Centers.  Located at the [[National Weather Center]] in [[Norman, Oklahoma]], its mission is the development of techniques for the computer-based prediction of high-impact local weather, such as individual spring and winter storms, with the [[NEXRAD]] (WSR-88D) [[Weather radar|Doppler weather radar]] serving as a key data source.

== Activities ==
Since 1989, scientists in CAPS have developed and improved ARPS (The Advanced Regional Prediction System). ARPS is a comprehensive regional to stormscale atmospheric modeling/prediction system. It is a complete system that includes a realtime data analysis and assimilation system, the forward prediction [[Computer model|model]] and a post-analysis package. ARPS has been used successfully in many real thunderstorm cases research.

== Development and project ==
CAPS, along with several other [[University of Oklahoma]] institutions, is a partner in a new Engineering Research Center led by the [[University of Massachusetts Amherst]]. The [[Engineering Research Center for Collaborative Adaptive Sensing of the Atmosphere]] (CASA) seeks to revolutionize the remote sensing of the lower [[troposphere]], initially via inexpensive, low-power, phased array Doppler weather radars placed on [[cell towers]] and buildings.   unique component of this project is that the sensors collaborate with one another and dynamically adjust their characteristics to sense multiple atmospheric phenomena while meeting multiple end user needs in an optimal manner.  

CAPS also is leading an NSF Large Information Technology Research (ITR) grant that seeks to develop an infrastructure for [[mesoscale meteorology]] research and education. Known as Linked Environments for Atmospheric Discovery (LEAD), a transforming element of this project is the ability for analysis tools, forecast models, and data repositories to function as dynamically adaptive, on-demand systems that can change configuration rapidly and automatically in response to the evolving weather; respond immediately to user decisions based upon the weather problem at hand; and steer remote observing systems to optimize data collection and forecast/warning quality.

The '''Chevrolet Avalanche''' was a four-door, five or six passenger [[pickup truck]] sharing [[General Motors|GM's]] long-wheelbase chassis used on the [[Chevrolet Suburban]] and [[Cadillac Escalade ESV]]. Breaking with a long-standing tradition, the Avalanche was not available as a [[GMC (automobile)|GMC]], but only as a [[Chevrolet]]. Production of the Avalanche started in 
September 2001 and ended April 2013; producing two generations in its lifespan.

The Avalanche was launched in September 2001 as a 2002 model on the [[GMT800]] platform. First year Avalanches featured light gray plastic body cladding, intended to provide visual distinction from the [[Chevrolet Suburban|Suburban/Yukon XL]]. Avalanche also gave the public an advance look at the next generation of front fascia designs for the entire GM line. A full-length chrome strip splits each lamp assembly and the grille, with a gold Chevrolet "bow tie" in the center. The hood and fenders featured aggressive folds, in contrast to the soft box of the other GMT800 models.

[[File:2003-06 Chevrolet Avalanche WBH.jpg|thumb|left|GMT800 Chevrolet Avalanche WBH]]

2003 models featured a darker cladding, but GM's new president, [[Rick Wagoner]], demanded removal of this "unpopular" trim (as did certain elements of the public). From mid-year, Avalanche could be ordered without the cladding. The uncladded model, known as the Without Body Hardware (or better by its acronym "WBH"), and alternatively called "slicksides" by GM marketers, resembles the '03-'05 [[Chevrolet Silverado|Silverado]] in the front.

Avalanche was nominated for the ''[[North American Car of the Year|North American SUV of the Year]]'' award and was ''[[Motor Trend]]'' magazine's [[Car of the Year|SUV of the Year]] for 2002.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.motortrend.com/oftheyear/truck/truck_of_the_year_winners/index.html |title=Motor Trend Trucks of the Year Winners List |publisher=Motortrend.com |date=2009-02-24 |accessdate=2009-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are two [[Internal combustion engine|engine]] choices:
* A [[GM small-block engine|Vortec]] 5.3&amp;nbsp;L [[V8 engine|V8]] producing 285&amp;nbsp;hp (216&amp;nbsp;[[Kilowatt|kW]]), for the half-ton 1500 series;
* A [[Chevrolet Big-Block engine#8100|Vortec]] 8.1&amp;nbsp;L V8 with 340&amp;nbsp;hp (253&amp;nbsp;kW) and the [[GM 4L80-E transmission#4L85-E|4L85-E]] four-speed transmission, for the three-quarter-ton 2500 series. The drive train is  [[rear-wheel drive]] or available with selectable high/low  [[four-wheel drive]].

The Avalanche was originally marketed as being able to "change from a SUV to a super SUV". This was made possible by a plastic cover and an exclusive "midgate" which could open and close. The midgate was a divider behind the second row of seats that could be folded down, with the seats, to create a longer bed area, or folded up to make a larger cab area. A similar midgate was found on the Cadillac Escalade EXT, Hummer H2 SUT and the GMC Envoy XUV.

For those who planned to go off-road in their Avalanche, a Z71 Off-Road package was available that added off-road suspension, GM's AutoTrac full-time, push-button four-wheel-drive system, all-terrain white-lettered tires, seventeen-inch alloy wheels, leather seating surfaces with cloth accents, front dual power bucket seats, cloth door panel inserts, GM's OnStar telematics system, all-weather rubber floor mats, Chevrolet bowtie emblems embedded into the backrests of the seats (for 2002 models), dual-zone automatic climate controls with rear HVAC vents and remote controls, remote radio controls with headphone jacks for two pairs of headphones, a security system, gray-finished side running boards, power-heated side view mirrors with integrated turn signals, mud flaps, SRS side airbags, and more. Aside from these details, a Z71 Off-Road sticker on the rear side panels identified an Avalanche equipped with this package. Full leather seating surfaces were an available option, also removing the cloth door panel inserts, and also added heated front seats.

For those who liked the styling of the Z71 Off-Road package but did not plan to take their Avalanche off-road, a Z66 On-Road package was also available. The Z66 On-Road package featured all the equipment that the Z71 Off-Road package offered, but replaced the off-road suspension with sport on-road suspension, and did not offer four-wheel-drive. Aside from these details, a Z66 On-Road sticker on the rear side panels identified an Avalanche equipped with this package. As with the Z71 Off-Road package, full leather seating surfaces without the cloth accents were an available option, also removing the cloth door panel inserts, and also added heated front seats.

To further distinguish it from its Silverado siblings, the Avalanche was practically fully equipped, and only came with body side cladding. The Avalanche included features such as sixteen-inch [[alloy wheels]] and tires (chromed steel on the 2500 model), an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD player and six speakers, cloth seating surfaces, front bench seat with power front driver's seat, power windows, power door locks, [[keyless entry]], full instrumentation, dual front [[airbags]], and [[air conditioning]]. Options included [[OnStar]] [[telematics]] system, [[cassette player]], [[leather]] seating surfaces, front dual power bucket seats that could be heated, and side [[airbags]] for the front seats. A [[The North Face|North Face]] Edition, in partnership with the North Face brand included limited exterior color options, a unique Ebony/Green [[leather]] interior, special exterior ornamentation and decals, white-faced gauges, [[OnStar]] [[telematics]] system, specially colored door panel inserts and speaker grilles, and more.

For 2003, the Avalanche was slightly changed. A new interior, shared with the [[Chevrolet Tahoe]] and [[Chevrolet Suburban]], added a new, larger steering wheel with subsequent audio system and [[OnStar]] controls and cruise and speed controls, an optional six-speaker premium [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] sound system with external [[amplifier]], a new gauge cluster with information center, memory for the front driver's seat (on some models), new radio [[head units]], which included an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD/MP3 player and [[Radio Data System]] or an AM/FM stereo with six-disc CD/MP3 changer and [[Radio Data System]], optional [[XM Satellite Radio]], standard [[OnStar]] [[telematics]] system, optional rear audio controls with [[heaphone]] jacks, an optional rear [[DVD]] entertainment system by [[Panasonic]] with wireless [[headphones]], new warning chimes that played through the vehicle's audio system instead of through a separate speaker behind the dashboard, and newly available seventeen-inch [[alloy wheels]] and tires. A new '''WBH''' option, standing for '''Without Body Hardware''', deleted the Avalanche's standard gray body-side cladding panels and replacing them with a thin black strip of plastic, for a cleaner exterior appearance. If an Avalanche owner did not want any black accents on the side of their trucks, the black strip of plastic could also be removed altogether.

[[Conversion van]] specialists '''Southern Comfort''' offered a conversion package for the Avalanche, which offered unique chrome-plated alloy wheels, a rear DVD entertainment system with satellite TV service, unique two-tone and fading paint jobs with exterior color-keyed lower trim and front and rear bumpers, unique seating surfaces, multiple wood interior trim options, and most of the features which were also offered on its [[conversion vans]]. The trucks also featured the '''Southern Comfort''' emblems on the exterior of the vehicle, and since they retained the same basic features as a factory Avalanche, a full [[General Motors]] warranty was offered, and the trucks could also be serviced at any [[Chevrolet]] dealership, as with the factory trucks.

===Cladding trouble===
Soon after the release of the Chevrolet Avalanche, customers began to notice cosmetic problems with the [[cladding (metalworking)|cladding]] on their vehicles. Over time exposure to heat and sunlight would cause a chalky faded appearance. It was especially noticeable on the cargo bed panels, and sail-panel windows where "Zebra Striping" would appear. Customer reaction to this problem resulted in General Motors agreeing to a one time treatment of a product called [http://www.armordillots1.com/ ArmorDillo]. This product would temporarily restore the cladding for a period of about 6 months. After that it would wear off then need to be re-applied. Realizing this was not a permanent solution, GM, together with [http://gatorbackcoatings.com/ Gatorback Coatings], developed a coating that could be applied to the cladding to restore it to a like-new shine. This product was designed to etch into the plastic and bond a new layer of tinted acrylic over the faded plastic. Customers within the 3yr/36,000 original factory warranty could go to their dealership to have it restored under their original warranty under GM TSB:04-08-111-001C. General Motors did not use side body cladding on the second generation model. General Motors has also identified the original source of the faded cladding.

The [[GMT900]] Avalanche was introduced at the [[Chicago Auto Show]] in February 2006. Production of the redesigned Avalanche began at the [[Silao Assembly]] in April 2006. The Avalanche maintained the styled front end much like its sister vehicles, the [[Chevrolet Tahoe|Tahoe/Yukon]] and Suburban/Yukon XL, yet it still had the distinct midgate and integrated bed as found on the previous incarnation. It had all the same standard and available features as the Suburban and the Tahoe. The 2500 model of the previous generation was discontinued.

A special Z71 package was offered for the second generation Avalanche. This off-road package consisted of a suspension tuned for rough terrain, an exclusive automatic locking rear differential, aluminum under body skid plates (visible from the front of the SUV), wheel flares, badges, wheels and tires.

Later models introduced another version of the Vortec 5.3-liter V8 as the engine is now capable of running on E85 ethanol. When the 5.3 is running on normal gasoline, it produces {{convert|320|hp|kW}} and {{Convert|335|lbft|Nm}} of torque whereas its output rises to {{convert|326|hp|kW}} and {{convert|348|lbft|Nm}} of torque on E85, up from {{convert|310|hp|kW}} and {{convert|335|lbft|Nm}} in 2009. For the 2010 model year, the 6.0-liter was dropped from the Avalanche lineup which left the 5.3 V8 as the only engine available for the SUV. In its final year, the 6.0-liter produced {{convert|366|hp|kW|}} and {{convert|376|lbft|Nm}} of torque.

A 2007 Avalanche was given away to the Most Valuable Player of the [[2006 in baseball|2006]] [[Major League Baseball All-Star Game]], [[Michael Young (baseball player)|Michael Young]].

An Avalanche is regularly featured on the popular US crime drama [[CSI: New York]] and is driven by some members of the team.

In addition, a 2007 Z-71 Avalanche placed second in [[Speed TV]]'s reality TV series '[[Bullrun (TV series)|Bullrun]]' in 2009.

===Trim Levels===

The second-generation Avalanche came in three well-equipped trim levels:

The '''LS''' served as the base model Avalanche. It included seventeen-inch [[alloy wheels]] and tires, cloth seating surfaces, power front driver's bucket seat, [[OnStar]] [[telematics]] system, an AM/FM stereo with single-disc CD/MP3 player and auxiliary audio input jack with six speakers, [[keyless entry]], and black door handles, tailgate handle, and side mirrors, [[aluminum]] interior trim, front and side [[airbags]], [[traction control]], [[StabiliTrak]], and more.

The '''LT''' served as the midlevel model Avalanche. It added power dual front bucket seats, [[remote start]], [[XM Satellite Radio]], [[Bluetooth]] hands-free telephone system, and exterior color-keyed door handles, tailgate handle, and side mirrors, [[wood]] interior trim, as well as other features.

The '''LTZ''' was the top-of-the-line model Avalanche. It added [[leather]] seating surfaces, [[security alarm]], an AM/FM stereo with six-disc CD/MP3/DVD changer, an eight-speaker premium [[Bose Corporation|Bose]] CenterPoint amplified [[surround sound]] system, memory for the front driver's seat, twenty-inch polished [[alloy wheels]] and tires, and rear seat audio and video system controls,and the LTZ exclusive self-leveling Auto Ride suspension.

===Black Diamond Edition===

2013 marked the Avalanche's last year of production. For 2013, all Avalanches, regardless of trim level, featured the '''Black Diamond Edition Package''', which added '''Black Diamond Edition''' emblems to the rear pillars, replacing the previous trim level designation emblems, and also adding unique emblems inside the Avalanche commemorating its production from 2002 to 2013. The 2013 Avalanche was produced in limited numbers. Each 2013 Avalanche buyer received a limited-edition [[coffee table]] book with photographs of the owner's 2013 Avalanche, a copy of the [[window sticker]] from their vehicle, and a complete history of the Avalanche from 2002 to 2013. The book was shipped to either the [[Car dealership|dealership]] or owner's home after the owner took delivery of their new 2013 Avalanche. In addition, a newly available color, named Fairway Green Metallic, commemorated the last year of production for the Avalanche (2013).

Engines:
* 5.3-liter [[GM small-block engine#5300|Vortec 5300]] [[V8 engine|V8]] with [[Active Fuel Management]], {{convert|320|hp|kW}}
* 6.0-liter [[GM small-block engine#HO 6100|VortecMAX]] V8 with [[variable valve timing|VVT]] and [[Active Fuel Management]], {{convert|367|hp|kW}} (late 2006)

===Discontinuation===
In April 2012, GM announced that production of the Avalanche would end after the 2013 model year, after 2011 saw a sales decline of 2.6% to 20,088 vehicles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/04/13/gm-announces-end-of-chevy-avalanche-with-black-diamond-edition/ |title=GM announces end of Chevy Avalanche with Black Diamond edition |publisher=Autoblog |date=13 April 2012 |accessdate=13 April 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/66to6P7pM?url=http://www.autoblog.com/2012/04/13/gm-announces-end-of-chevy-avalanche-with-black-diamond-edition/ |archivedate=13 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Production of the Cadillac Escalade EXT also ended after the 2013 model year.

The abstract of an article by B. P. Chandra, V. Kalia and S. C. Datt of [[Rani Durgavati University]] (Jabulpur, India), entitled ''Crystalloluminescence: a new [[tool]] to determine the critical size of a [[crystal]] [[Atomic nucleus|nucleus]]'', states:
:"There is a time lag between the achievement of supersaturation in a solution and the appearance of crystalloluminescence flashes from crystal nuclei. The incubation time of crystalloluminescence decreases systematically with the concentration of the [[solution]]. A new method based on crystalloluminescence measurements is proposed for the determination of the critical size of the crystal nucleus."

A '''decoupling capacitor''' is a [[capacitor]] used to [[Decoupling_(electronics)|decouple]] one part of an [[electrical network]] (circuit) from another. Noise caused by other circuit elements is shunted through the capacitor, reducing the effect it has on the rest of the circuit.  An alternative name is '''bypass capacitor''' as it is used to bypass the power supply or other high impedance component of a circuit.

==Discussion==
Active devices of an electronic system (transistors, ICs, vacuum tubes, for example) are connected to their power supplies through conductors with finite resistance and inductance. If the current drawn by an active device changes, voltage drops from power supply to device will also change due to these impedances. If several active devices share a common path to the power supply, changes in the current drawn by one element may produce voltage changes large enough to affect the operation of others - [[voltage spike]]s or [[ground bounce]], for example - so the change of state of one device is coupled to others through the common impedance to the power supply.  A decoupling capacitor provides a bypass path for transient currents, instead of flowing through the common impedance. &lt;ref name=TTL75&gt; Don Lancaster, ''TTL Cookbook', Howard W. Sams, 1975, no ISBN, pp.23-24 &lt;/ref&gt;

The decoupling capacitor works as the device’s local [[Electric field|energy storage]]. The capacitor is placed between power line and ground to the circuit that current is to be provided. According to capacitor equation, &lt;math&gt;\textstyle i(t) = C \frac{\mathrm{d}v(t)}{\mathrm{d}t}&lt;/math&gt;, voltage drop between power line and ground results in current draw out from the capacitor to the circuit and when capacitance ''C'' is large enough, sufficient current is supplied to maintain an acceptable range of voltage drop. To reduce the effective series inductance, small and large capacitors are often placed in parallel; commonly positioned adjacent to individual integrated circuits. The capacitor stores a small amount of energy that can compensate for the voltage drop in the power supply conductors to the capacitor. 

In digital circuits, decoupling capacitors also help prevent radiation of [[electromagnetic interference]] from relatively long circuit traces due to rapidly changing power supply currents. 

Decoupling capacitors alone may not suffice in such cases as a high-power amplifier stage with a low-level pre-amplifer coupled to it.  Care must be taken in layout of circuit conductors so that heavy current at one stage does not produce power supply voltage drops that affect other stages. This may require re-routing printed circuit board traces to segregate circuits, or the use of a [[ground plane]] to improve stability of power supply.

==Decoupling==
A bypass capacitor is often used to decouple a subcircuit from AC signals or [[voltage spike]]s on a power supply or other line. A bypass capacitor can [[Shunt (electrical)|shunt]] energy from those signals, or transients, past the subcircuit to be decoupled, right to the return path.  For a power supply line, a bypass capacitor from the supply voltage line to the power supply return (neutral) would be used.

High frequencies and transient currents can flow through a capacitor to circuit ground instead of to the harder path of the decoupled circuit, but DC cannot go through the capacitor and continues on to the decoupled circuit.

Another kind of decoupling is stopping a portion of a circuit from being affected by switching that occurs in another portion of the circuit. Switching in subcircuit A may cause fluctuations in the power supply or other electrical lines, but you do not want subcircuit B, which has nothing to do with that switching, to be affected. A decoupling capacitor can decouple subcircuits A and B so that B doesn't see any effects of the switching.

==Switching subcircuits==
In a subcircuit, switching will change the load current drawn from the source. Typical power supply lines show inherent [[inductance]], which results in a slower response to change in current. The supply voltage will drop across these parasitic inductances for as long as the switching event occurs. This transient voltage drop would be seen by other loads as well if the inductance between two loads is much lower compared to the inductance between the loads and the output of the power supply.

To decouple other subcircuits from the effect of the sudden current demand, a decoupling capacitor can be placed in parallel with the subcircuit, across its supply voltage lines. When switching occurs in the subcircuit, the capacitor supplies the transient current. Ideally, by the time the capacitor runs out of charge, the switching event has finished, so that the load can draw full current at normal voltage from the power supply and the capacitor can recharge. The best way to reduce switching noise is to design a [[Printed circuit board|PCB]] as a giant capacitor by sandwiching the power and ground planes across a [[dielectric]] material.{{Citation needed|date=August 2018}}

Sometimes parallel combinations of capacitors are used to improve response. This is because real capacitors have parasitic inductance, which distorts the capacitor's behavior at higher frequencies.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=EEVblog|title=EEVblog #859 - Bypass Capacitor Tutorial|date=2016-03-10|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BcJ6UdDx1vg|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cypress.com/file/135716/download|title=Using Decoupling Capacitors|last=|first=|date=2017-04-07|website=Cypress|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-08-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Transient load decoupling==
[[Transient (oscillation)|Transient]] [[Electrical load|load]] decoupling as described above is needed when there is a large load that gets switched quickly. The parasitic inductance in every (decoupling) capacitor may limit the suitable capacity and influence appropriate type if switching occurs very fast.

[[Logic]] circuits tend to do sudden switching (an ideal logic circuit would switch from low voltage to high voltage instantaneously, with no middle voltage ever observable). So logic circuit boards often have a decoupling capacitor close to each logic IC connected from each power supply connection to a nearby ground. These capacitors decouple every IC from every other IC in terms of supply voltage dips. 

These capacitors are often placed at each power source as well as at each analog component in order to ensure that the supplies are as steady as possible. Otherwise, an analog component with poor [[power supply rejection ratio|power supply rejection ratio (PSRR)]] will copy fluctuations in the power supply onto its output. 

In these applications, the decoupling capacitors are often called ''bypass capacitors'' to indicate that they provide an alternate path for high-frequency signals that would otherwise cause the normally steady supply voltage to change. Those components that require quick injections of current can ''bypass'' the power supply by receiving the current from the nearby capacitor. Hence, the slower power supply connection is used to charge these capacitors, and the capacitors actually provide the large quantities of high-availability current.

==Placement==
A transient load decoupling capacitor is placed as close as possible to the device requiring the decoupled signal. This minimizes the amount of line [[inductance]] and series [[Electrical resistance|resistance]] between the decoupling capacitor and the device. The longer the conductor between the capacitor and the device, the more inductance is present.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.interfacebus.com/Design_Capacitors.html Capacitor Design Data, and Decoupling Placement, How-to] on [http://www.interfacebus.com/ Leroy's Engineering Web Site]&lt;/ref&gt;

Since capacitors differ in their high-frequency characteristics (and capacitors with good high-frequency properties are often types with small capacity, while large capacitors usually have worse high-frequency response), decoupling often involves the use of a combination of capacitors. For example in logic circuits, a common arrangement is ~100 nF ceramic per logic IC (multiple ones for complex ICs), combined with [[Electrolytic capacitor|electrolytic]] or [[tantalum capacitor]](s) up to a few hundred μF per board or board section.

The film was nominated for two [[Oscars]] at the [[89th Academy Awards]]: [[Academy Award for Best Sound Editing|Best Sound Editing]] and [[Academy Award for Best Visual Effects|Best Visual Effects]], and a [[BAFTA Award for Best Sound]] at the [[70th British Academy Film Awards]].

==Plot==
On April 20, 2010, ''[[Deepwater Horizon]]'', an [[Oil platform|oil drilling rig]] operated by private contractor [[Transocean]], is set to begin drilling off the southern coast of [[Louisiana]] on behalf of [[BP]]. Chief Electronics Technician Michael "Mike" Williams ([[Mark Wahlberg]]) and Offshore Installation Manager James "Mr. Jimmy" Harrell ([[Kurt Russell]]) are surprised to learn that the workers assigned to test the integrity of recently completed cement work are being sent home early, without conducting a [[cement bond log]] (CBL), at the insistence of BP managers Donald Vidrine ([[John Malkovich]]) and Robert Kaluza ([[Brad Leland]]). While Mike prepares the drilling team, including Caleb Holloway ([[Dylan O'Brien]]), Harrell meets with Vidrine and persuades him to conduct a test, which only serves to weaken the already poorly placed cement further. His patience thinning, and without waiting for Harrell to confirm the results, Vidrine orders the well to be flowed.

At first, the operation goes smoothly, but the cement job eventually fails completely, triggering a massive [[Blowout (well drilling)|blowout]] that overpowers and kills the drill team members Keith Manuel, Shane Roshto, Roy Kemp, Karl Kleppinger, Adam Weise, and Gordon Jones.

A chain of equipment malfunctions, coupled with a failed attempt to seal the well, ignites the oil, killing Dewey Revette, Stephen Curtis, Jason Anderson ([[Ethan Suplee]]), and Donald Clark. Andrea Fleytas ([[Gina Rodriguez]]), the rig's Dynamic Position Operator, tries to alert the [[Coast Guard]], only to be overruled by her superior, Captain Curt Kuchta, on the grounds that the rig is not in any imminent danger. With oil now spewing into the ocean, a frightened, oil covered [[pelican]] flies into the bridge of a nearby vessel and dies, which heads towards the rig just as the workers begin a frantic evacuation. Harrell, still alive, although seriously injured in the explosion, is rescued by Mike and assumes control of the situation, only to discover that the rig cannot be saved. Aaron Dale Burkeen, a close friend of Mike's, sacrifices himself to keep a burning crane from collapsing onto the surviving crew, while Mike and Caleb are able to rescue Vidrine and Kaluza and get them to safety.

As night falls and the burning oil lights up the area, the Coast Guard becomes aware of the incident and sends a ship to collect the survivors, who are being ferried in the lifeboats to the ''Damon Bankston''. With all the lifeboats full, Mike locates the emergency life raft, but it becomes separated from the rig before he and Andrea can board, causing the latter to suffer a [[panic attack]]. Just as the oil in the well itself ignites and destroys the rig, the two jump into the water and are picked up by rescuers, who then ferry them to the ''Damon Bankston''.

Returned home, the workers reunite with their families in a hotel lobby, during which the father of one of the dead crew members family angrily confronts Mike for failing to save his son, resulting in Mike having a panic attack himself.

The film ends with a series of clips showing the aftermath of the disaster, including testimony from the real-life Mike Williams and the revelation that not a single employee of either Transocean or BP was prosecuted for their actions. Pictures appear of the 11 men who lost their lives before the credits.  The movie postscript reads: [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill|"The blowout lasted for 87 days, spilling an estimated 210 million gallons of oil into the Gulf of Mexico. It was the worst oil disaster in U.S. history."]]

==Reception==

===Box office===
''Deepwater Horizon'' grossed $61.4 million in the United States and Canada and $60.4 million in other territories for a worldwide total of $121.8 million, against a net production budget of around $110 million.&lt;ref name="BOM"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=deepwaterhorizon.htm |title=''Deepwater Horizon'' (2016) |website=[[Box Office Mojo]] |publisher=[[IMDb]] |accessdate=August 17, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States and Canada, ''Deepwater Horizon'' was projected to gross $16–20 million from 3,259 theaters in its opening weekend, although some publications noted Wahlberg's films tend to outperform box office projections.&lt;ref name="DEAD"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/09/miss-peregrines-home-for-peculiar-children-deepwater-horizon-masterminds-magnificent-seven-weekend-box-office-preview-1201827350/ |title=‘Miss Peregrine’ To Punish Competition At Weekend Box Office – Preview |work= [[Deadline Hollywood]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LABudget"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/cotown/la-et-ct-movie-projector-20160926-snap-story.html|title='Miss Peregrine' expected to top 'Deepwater Horizon' and 'Magnificent Seven' at the box office|author=Ryan Faughnder|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=September 27, 2016|accessdate=September 28, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film made $860,000 from its Thursday night previews at 2,400 theaters, and $7.1 million on its first day.&lt;ref name=Thursday&gt;{{cite web|title=‘Miss Peregrine’ Enrolls Moviegoers On Thursday Night – Box Office |url=http://deadline.com/2016/09/miss-peregrine-tim-burton-deepwater-horizon-masterminds-weekend-box-office-1201828893/|website=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|accessdate=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In total, the film earned $20.2 million during its opening weekend, debuting at number two at the box office behind [[Tim Burton]]'s ''[[Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children (film)|Miss Peregrine's Home for Peculiar Children]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/weekend-box-office-miss-peregrine-934482|title=Weekend Box Office: 'Miss Peregrine's' Blows Past 'Deepwater Horizon' With $28.5M|author=Pamela McClintock|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 2, 2016|accessdate=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was released at a time when the marketplace was already dominated by two other adult-skewing pictures, ''[[The Magnificent Seven (2016 film)|The Magnificent Seven]]'' and ''[[Sully (film)|Sully]]''.&lt;ref name="DEAD1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/10/miss-peregrine-tim-burton-deepwater-horizon-masterminds-weekend-box-office-1201828893/|title=‘Miss Peregrine’ Rules With $28M+; ‘Deepwater Horizon’ Pulls $20.6M; ‘Masterminds’ Bombs – Sunday Update|author=Anthony D'Alessandro|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=October 2, 2016|accessdate=October 2, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film over-performed in the [[Gulf Coast]] region, and also did exceptionally well in IMAX, which earned $2.7 million of the film's total opening weekend.&lt;ref name="DEAD1"/&gt;

The film's opening weekend was regarded as underwhelming and a disappointment, given its hefty production budget, but dramas released during the fall, and Wahlberg's films, tend to have box office legs.&lt;ref name="DEAD1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/speakeasy/2016/10/02/miss-peregrines-home-for-peculiar-children-wins-weekend-box-office/|title=‘Miss Peregrine’s Home for Peculiar Children’ Wins Weekend Box Office|author=Erich Schwartzel|work=The Wall Street Journal|date=October 2, 2016|accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Forbes]]'' called the opening "good, but not great", especially considering the solid reviews.&lt;ref name="FA"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/scottmendelson/2016/10/02/box-office-tim-burtons-miss-peregrine-tops-deepwater-horizon-with-strong-28-5m-weekend/#7ccf2393378f|title=Box Office: Tim Burton's 'Miss Peregrine's' Tops 'Deepwater Horizon' With Strong $28.5M Weekend|author=Scott Mendelson|work=[[Forbes]]|date=October 2, 2016|accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; While most adult-skewing films would generally be made on a conservative budget in order to protect themselves financially, ''Deepwater Horizon'' was produced for $110–120 million (after tax rebates). Box office analyst Jeff Block said the film was "a hard sell. This should have been a $60 million film. The budget was out of control." Recent real-life drama films such as ''Sully'' ($60 million budget), ''[[Bridge of Spies (film)|Bridge of Spies]]'' ($40 million) and ''[[Captain Phillips (film)|Captain Phillips]]'' ($55 million) were made for more moderate amounts. ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' noted that when Hollywood spends north of $100 million on a film, it is intended for a much broader audience, but that was not the case for ''Deepwater Horizon'', as the main demographics were adults, with 67% of the total ticket buyers during its opening weekend being over the age of 35.&lt;ref name="Analysis"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/news/box-office-analysis-can-deepwater-934561|title=Box-Office Analysis: Can 'Deepwater Horizon' Be Rescued|author=Pamela McClintock|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|date=October 3, 2016|accessdate=October 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another possible reason for the film's mediocre debut was its marketing miss, which was also a subject of criticism; from the outset, Lionsgate marketed the film as a heroic tale versus an issues-oriented movie. The name "''Deepwater Horizon''" itself is more associated with the aftermath of the spill than the heroics of the men who survived and helped their fellow workers.&lt;ref name="Analysis"/&gt; ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' estimated the film lost at least $60 million, when factoring together all expenses and revenues.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lists/2016s-biggest-box-office-bombs-958780/item/box-office-bombs-gods-egypt-959603|title='Ben Hur' to 'BFG': Hollywood's Biggest Box-Office Bombs of 2016|author=Pamela McClintock|author2=Mia Galuppo|work=[[The Hollywood Reporter]]|publisher=[[Prometheus Global Media|Prometheus Global Media, LLC]]|date=September 8, 2016|accessdate=July 13, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Deepwater Horizon'' received generally positive reviews from critics. On [[Rotten Tomatoes]] the film has an approval rating of 84% based on 222 reviews with an [[average rating]] of 7/10. The site's critical consensus reads, "''Deepwater Horizon'' makes effective use of its titular man-made disaster to deliver an uncommonly serious – yet still suitably gripping – action thriller."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/deepwater_horizon |title=''Deepwater Horizon'' (2016) |work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]] |publisher=[[Fandango Media|Fandango]] |accessdate=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; On [[Metacritic]], the film has a score 68 out of 100 based on 52 critics, indicating "generally favorable reviews".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.metacritic.com/movie/deepwater-horizon |title=''Deepwater Horizon'' Reviews|work=[[Metacritic]] |publisher=[[CBS Interactive]] |accessdate=October 7, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Audiences polled by [[CinemaScore]] gave the film an average grade of "A–" on an A+ to F scale.&lt;ref name="CinemaScore"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://m.cinemascore.com |archive-url=https://archive.is/20150405021357/http://m.cinemascore.com/ |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2015-04-05 |title=CinemaScore |work=cinemascore.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Todd McCarthy of ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' gave the film a positive review, writing, "ruggedness and resilience counts for far more in the characterizations here than does nuance, and everyone delivers as required. From a craft and technical point of view, the film is all but seamless, a credit to the extra care taken to avoid a CGI look."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/review/deepwater-horizon-review-928722 |title='Deepwater Horizon': Film Review {{!}} TIFF 2016 |work= [[The Hollywood Reporter]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mike Ryan of ''[[Uproxx]]'' praised the film's performances and ability to make audiences angry at [[BP]]: "I’ll be honest, I didn’t think we needed a movie about this subject.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5598">The '''Doherty amplifier''' is a modified [[Electronic amplifier#Class B|class B]] [[radio frequency]] [[amplifier]] invented by [[William H. Doherty]] of [[Bell Telephone Laboratories]] Inc in 1936. In Doherty's day, within the Western Electric product line, the eponymous electronic device was operated as a linear amplifier with a driver which was modulated. In the 50,000 watt implementation, the driver was a complete 5,000 watt transmitter which could, if necessary, be operated independently of the Doherty amplifier and the Doherty amplifier was used to raise the 5,000 watt level to the required 50,000 watt level.

The amplifier was usually configured as a grounded-cathode, carrier-peak amplifier using two [[vacuum tube]]s in parallel connection, one as a class B carrier tube and the other as a class B peak tube ([[power transistor]]s in modern implementations). The tubes' source (driver) and load (antenna) were split and combined through + and — 90 degree phase shifting networks.&lt;ref&gt;In order to circumvent Western Electric's patent, RCA utilized + 90 and + 270 degree phase shifts; as any student of phasor math knows, + 270 degrees is equivalent to – 90 degrees, therefore these are effectively the same as + and – 90 degree phase shifts (RCA BT-50D, et al.)&lt;/ref&gt; Alternate configurations included a grounded-grid carrier tube and a grounded-cathode peak tube whereby the driver power was effectively passed-through the carrier tube and was added to the resulting output power, but this benefit was more appropriate for the earlier and less efficient triode implementations&lt;ref&gt;WE 117, CE 317A, CE 317B, WAPE station-built, et al.&lt;/ref&gt; rather than the later and more efficient tetrode implementations.&lt;ref&gt;CE 317C&lt;/ref&gt;

==Successor developments==
As successor to [[Western Electric]] Company, Inc. (WE) for radio broadcast transmitters, the Doherty concept was considerably refined by [[Continental Electronics]] Manufacturing Company of Dallas, Texas (CE).

Early Continental Electronics designs, by James O. Weldon and others, retained most of the characteristics of Doherty's amplifier but added medium-level screen-grid modulation of the driver (317B, et al.).

The ultimate refinement was the high-level screen-grid modulation scheme invented by Joseph B. Sainton.

Sainton's 317C series consisted of a class C carrier tube in parallel connection with a class C peak tube. The tubes' source (driver) and load (antenna) were split and combined through + and − 90-degree phase-shifting networks as in a Doherty amplifier. The unmodulated radio frequency carrier was applied to the control grids of both tubes. Carrier modulation was applied to the screen grids of both tubes but the screen grid bias points of the carrier and peak tubes were different and were established such that the peak tube was cut off when modulation was absent and the amplifier was producing rated unmodulated carrier power and both tubes were conducting and each tube was contributing twice the rated carrier power during 100% modulation as four times the rated carrier power is required to achieve 100% modulation. As both tubes were operated in class C, a significant improvement in efficiency was thereby achieved in the final stage. In addition, as the tetrode carrier and peak tubes required very little drive power, a significant improvement in efficiency within the driver was achieved as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{Ref patent

}}&lt;/ref&gt; The commercial version of the Sainton amplifier employed a cathode-follower modulator, not the push-pull modulator disclosed in the patent,&lt;ref&gt;The disclosed push-pull modulator consisted of a phase-splitter with unequal gains followed by a non-inverting cathode-follower modulator (gain less than unity) from the non-inverting side of the phase-splitter and an inverting modulator (gain significantly greater than unity) from the inverting side of the phase-splitter. Therefore, the disclosed push-pull modulator wasn't push-pull at all. The commercial version utilized a pair of tubes in parallel as a cathode-follower modulator with, consequently, no need to balance grossly different gains of the two modulator tubes. However, a scheme to finely balance the two modulator tubes, which had the same nominal gain, was incorporated just the same.&lt;/ref&gt; and the entire 50,000-watt transmitter was implemented using only nine total tubes of four tube types, all of these being general-purpose, a remarkable achievement, given that the 317C's most significant competitor, RCA's BTA-50H, was implemented using thirty-two total tubes of nine tube types, nearly one-half of these being special-purpose, employed only in the BTA-50H. Nearly 300 CE 317C transmitters were installed in North America alone, easily outdistancing all competitors combined.

'''Driftwood''' is [[wood]] that has been washed onto a shore or beach of a sea, lake, or river by the action of winds, tides or waves. It is a form of [[marine debris]] or tidewrack.

In some [[Dock (maritime)|waterfront]] areas, driftwood is a major nuisance. However, the driftwood provides shelter and food for birds, fish and other aquatic species as it floats in the ocean. [[Gribble]]s, [[shipworm]]s and [[bacterium|bacteria]] decompose the wood and gradually turn it into nutrients that are reintroduced to the [[food web]]. Sometimes, the partially decomposed wood washes ashore, where it also shelters birds, plants, and other species. Driftwood can become the foundation for [[sand dunes]].

Most driftwood is the remains of [[tree]]s, in whole or part, that have been washed into the [[ocean]], due to [[flood]]ing, high winds, or other natural occurrences, or as the result of [[logging]].  There is also a subset of driftwood known as drift lumber. Drift lumber includes the remains of man-made wooden objects, such as buildings and their contents washed into the sea during storms, wooden objects discarded into the water from shore, dropped [[dunnage]] or lost [[cargo]] from ships ([[jetsam]]), and the remains of [[shipwreck]]ed wooden ships and boats ([[flotsam]]).  Erosion and wave action may make it difficult or impossible to determine the origin of a particular piece of driftwood.

Driftwood can be used as part of decorative [[furniture]] or other [[art]] forms, and is a popular element in the [[aquascaping|scenery of fish tanks]].

==Fire==
The EPA includes driftwood in its list of "Items You Should Never Burn in Your [Wood-Burning] Appliance," because it will "release toxic chemicals when burned".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.epa.gov/burnwise/bestburn.html|title=Burn Wise - US EPA|first=US|last=EPA, OAR, OAQPS|date=|website=US EPA|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Driftwood in history==
According to [[Norse mythology]], the first humans, [[Ask and Embla]], were formed out of two pieces of driftwood, an [[ash (tree)|ash]] and an [[elm]], by the god [[Odin]] and his brothers, [[Vili and Vé]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.godchecker.com/pantheon/norse-mythology.php?deity=ASK pantheons and gods website] God checker.com Retrieved 09/09/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

The Vikings would cast wood into the sea before making landfall. And the location of the wood would be an indication as to where to build their [[mead hall]]s. The wood used would found the high-seat pillars of the new hall.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hurstwic.org/history/articles/mythology/religion/text/practices.htm] Heathen Practices in the Viking Age&lt;/ref&gt;

Driftwood carried by [[Arctic]] rivers was the main, or sometimes only, source of wood for some [[Inuit]] and other Arctic populations living north of the [[tree line]] until they came into regular contact with [[Europe]]an traders. Traditional Inuit boats such as the [[kayak]] were fashioned from driftwood frames covered in skins.  Wood that is burned today in these regions mainly consists of the remains of condemned wooden structures. Driftwood is still used as kindling by some.

The "[[Old Man of the Lake]]" in [[Crater Lake]], [[Oregon]] is a full-size tree that has been bobbing vertically in the lake for more than a century.&lt;ref&gt;Salinas, J., "The Old Man of the Lake," [https://web.archive.org/web/20090116011644/http://www.nps.gov/archive/crla/notes/vol27e.htm ''Nature Notes from Crater Lake National Park''], Vol. XXVII (1996).&lt;/ref&gt; Due to the cold water of the lake, the tree has been well preserved.

Driftwood Sculptures are sculptures that are made of driftwood on beaches or [[mudflat]]s:
*At [[Kullaberg]], [[Sweden]], [[Lars Vilks]] created [[Ladonia (micronation)|Nimis]] a driftwood artwork in the year 1980.  This sculpture and two others led to the declaration of [[Ladonia (micronation)|Ladonia]] as an independent nation.
*Sculptures were created on the [[Emeryville, California]] mudflat and marsh area of [[San Francisco Bay]] in the late 1960s.
*A driftwood sculpture was constructed in the [http://www.patrimoine.ville-arles.fr/arles/ville.cfm?action=edifice&amp;id=61 Chapelle St Anne] d' [http://www.ville-arles.fr/ Arles] (France) by the visitors to the exhibition "Marcher dans le pas des glaneurs" organized by "A Flots perdus" (Arlésiens artists), in March 2008.
*The [[Ashden Awards for Sustainable Energy]] (sometimes called the "Green Oscars") are sculpted out of driftwood.
*Artist [[Deborah Butterfield]] is known for her sculptures of horses, initially rendered from driftwood before being cast in bronze.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artnet.com/artists/deborah-butterfield/|title=Deborah Butterfield - artnet|author=|date=|website=www.artnet.com|accessdate=11 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1455">The '''Drinking Water Inspectorate''' ('''DWI''') is a section of [[Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs]] (DEFRA) set up to regulate the public [[water supply]] companies in [[England]] and [[Wales]].

Based in [[Whitehall]], it produces an annual report showing the quality of and problems associated with drinking water. Its remit is to assess the [[water quality|quality]] of [[drinking water]] in England and Wales, taking enforcement action if standards are not being met, and appropriate action when water is unfit for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dwi.gov.uk/ Drinking Water Inspectorate web site]. Accessed 5 October 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

It is also responsible for reporting on drinking water quality to the European Union under the European Drinking Water Directive (DWD), [[Council Directive 98/83/EC]], which concerns the quality of water intended for human consumption.&lt;ref&gt;[http://ec.europa.eu/environment/water/water-drink/index_en.html The European Commission's Environment DG web site].

'''Exopolysaccharides''' (also sometimes abbreviated '''EPSs''') are high-molecular-weight polymers that are composed of sugar residues and are secreted by a [[microorganism]] into the surrounding environment. Microorganisms synthesize a wide spectrum of multifunctional [[polysaccharide]]s including intracellular polysaccharides, structural polysaccharides and extracellular polysaccharides or exopolysaccharides. Exopolysaccharides generally consist of monosaccharides and some non-carbohydrate substituents (such as [[acetate]], [[pyruvate]], [[succinate]], and [[phosphate]]). Owing to the wide diversity in composition, exopolysaccharides have found multifarious applications in various food and pharmaceutical industries. Many microbial EPSs provide properties that are almost identical to the [[Natural gum|gum]]s currently in use. With innovative approaches, efforts are underway to supersede the traditionally used plant and algal gums by their microbial counterparts. Moreover, considerable progress has been made in discovering and developing new microbial EPSs that possess novel [[industrial significance]].&lt;ref name=10suresh&gt;{{cite book |author=Suresh and Mody|year=2009|chapter=Microbial Exopolysaccharides: Variety and Potential Applications|title=Microbial Production of Biopolymers and Polymer Precursors|publisher=Caister Academic Press|isbn = 978-1-904455-36-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Function ==
Capsular exopolysaccharides can protect pathogenic bacteria against desiccation and predation, and contribute to their pathogenicity.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghosh|first=Pallab Kumar|last2=Maiti|first2=Tushar Kanti|title=Structure of Extracellular Polysaccharides (EPS) Produced by Rhizobia and their Functions in Legume–Bacteria Symbiosis: — A Review|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.als.2016.11.003|journal=Achievements in the Life Sciences|volume=10|issue=2|pages=136–143|doi=10.1016/j.als.2016.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bacteria existing in biofilms are less vulnerable compared to planktonic bacteria, as the EPS matrix is able to act as a protective diffusion barrier.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Harimawan|first=Ardiyan|last2=Ting|first2=Yen-Peng|date=2016-10-01|title=Investigation of extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) properties of P. aeruginosa and B. subtilis and their role in bacterial adhesion|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0927776516304696|journal=Colloids and Surfaces B: Biointerfaces|volume=146|issue=Supplement C|pages=459–467|doi=10.1016/j.colsurfb.2016.06.039}}&lt;/ref&gt; The physical and chemical characteristics of bacterial cells can be affected by EPS composition, influencing factors such as cellular recognition, aggregation, and adhesion in their natural environments.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Furthermore, the EPS layer acts as a nutrient trap, facilitating bacterial growth.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

The exopolysaccharides of some strains of lactic acid bacteria, e.g., [[Lactococcus lactis]] subsp. cremoris, contribute a gelatinous texture to fermented milk products (e.g., [[Viili]]), and these polysaccharides are also digestible.&lt;ref name="WelmanAD2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bacterial Polysaccharides: Current Innovations and Future Trends|author=Welman AD|publisher=Caister Academic Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-904455-45-5|chapter=Exploitation of Exopolysaccharides from lactic acid bacteria}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LjunghWadstrom2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Lactobacillus Molecular Biology: From Genomics to Probiotics|author=Ljungh A, Wadstrom T (editors)|publisher=Caister Academic Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-904455-41-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; An example for industrial use of exopolysaccharides is the application of dextran in panettone and other breads in the bakery industry.&lt;ref name="UllrichM2"&gt;{{cite book|title=Bacterial Polysaccharides: Current Innovations and Future Trends|author=Ullrich M (editor)|publisher=Caister Academic Press|year=2009|isbn=978-1-904455-45-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ecology ===
Exopolysaccharides can facilitate the attachment of [[nitrogen-fixing bacteria]] to plant roots and soil particles, which mediates a symbiotic relationship.&lt;ref name=":02"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ghosh|first=Pallab Kumar|last2=Maiti|first2=Tushar Kanti|title=Structure of Extracellular Polysaccharides (EPS) Produced by Rhizobia and their Functions in Legume–Bacteria Symbiosis: — A Review|url=https://doi.org/10.1016/j.als.2016.11.003|journal=Achievements in the Life Sciences|volume=10|issue=2|pages=136–143|doi=10.1016/j.als.2016.11.003}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important for colonization of roots and the [[rhizosphere]], which is a key component of soil food webs and nutrient cycling in ecosystems. It also allows for successful invasion and infection of the host plant.&lt;ref name=":02" /&gt;

Bacterial extracellular polymeric substances can aid in [[bioremediation]] of heavy metals as they have the capacity to adsorb metal cations, among other dissolved substances.&lt;ref name=":12"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Pal|first=Arundhati|last2=Paul|first2=A. K.|date=2008-03-01|title=Microbial extracellular polymeric substances: central elements in heavy metal bioremediation|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12088-008-0006-5|journal=Indian Journal of Microbiology|language=en|volume=48|issue=1|pages=49|doi=10.1007/s12088-008-0006-5|issn=0046-8991|pmc=3450203}}&lt;/ref&gt; This can be useful in the treatment of wastewater systems, as biofilms are able to bind to and remove metals such as copper, lead, nickel, and cadmium.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt; The binding affinity and metal specificity of EPS varies depending on polymer composition, as well as environmental factors such as concentration and pH.&lt;ref name=":12" /&gt;

In a [[Geomicrobiology|geomicrobiological]] context, EPS has been observed to affect precipitation of minerals, particularly [[Carbonate|carbonates]].&lt;ref name=":22"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Tourney|first=Janette|last2=Ngwenya|first2=Bryne T.|date=2014-10-29|title=The role of bacterial extracellular polymeric substances in geomicrobiology|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0009254114003842|journal=Chemical Geology|volume=386|issue=Supplement C|pages=115–132|doi=10.1016/j.chemgeo.2014.08.011}}&lt;/ref&gt; EPS may also bind to and trap particles in biofilm suspensions, which can restrict dispersion and element cycling.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; Sediment stability can be increased by EPS, as it influences cohesion, permeability, and erosion of the sediment.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; There is evidence that the adhesion and metal-binding ability of EPS affects mineral leaching rates in both environmental and industrial contexts.&lt;ref name=":22" /&gt; These interactions between EPS and the abiotic environment allow for EPS to largely impact [[Biogeochemical cycle|biogeochemical cycling]].

=== Novel industrial use ===
Due to the growing need to find a more efficient and environmentally friendly alternative to conventional waste removal methods, industries are paying more attention to the function of bacteria and their EPSs in [[bioremediation]].&lt;ref name=":03"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mota|first=Rita|last2=Rossi|first2=Federico|last3=Andrenelli|first3=Luisa|last4=Pereira|first4=Sara Bernardes|last5=De Philippis|first5=Roberto|date=September 2016|title=Released polysaccharides (RPS) from Cyanothece sp.

Researchers found that adding EPSs from [[cyanobacteria]] to [[Wastewater|wastewaters]] removes heavy metals such as copper, cadmium and lead.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;EPSs alone can physically interact with these heavy metals and take them in through [[biosorption]].&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt; The efficiency of removal can be optimized by treating the EPSs with different acids or bases first before adding them to the wastewaters.&lt;ref name=":03" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

Contaminated soils contain high levels of [[Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbon|Polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons]] (PAHs); EPSs from two bacteria, [[Zoogloea|''Zoogloea'' sp]]. and&amp;nbsp; ''[[Aspergillus niger]]'', are efficient at removing these toxic compounds.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Jia|first=Chunyun|last2=Li|first2=Peijun|last3=Li|first3=Xiaojun|last4=Tai|first4=Peidong|last5=Liu|first5=Wan|last6=Gong|first6=Zongqiang|date=2011-08-01|title=Degradation of pyrene in soils by extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) extracted from liquid cultures|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S1359511311001644|journal=Process Biochemistry|volume=46|issue=8|pages=1627–1631|doi=10.1016/j.procbio.2011.05.005}}&lt;/ref&gt;&amp;nbsp;EPSs contain enzymes such as [[oxidoreductase]] and [[hydrolase]], which are capable of&amp;nbsp; degrading PAHs.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The amount of PAHs degradation depends on the concentration of EPSs added to the soil. This method proves to be low cost and highly efficient.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&amp;nbsp;

In recent years, EPSs from marine bacteria have been found to speed up the cleanup of oil spills.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gutierrez|first=Tony|last2=Berry|first2=David|last3=Yang|first3=Tingting|last4=Mishamandani|first4=Sara|last5=McKay|first5=Luke|last6=Teske|first6=Andreas|last7=Aitken|first7=Michael D.|date=2013-06-27|title=Role of Bacterial Exopolysaccharides (EPS) in the Fate of the Oil Released during the Deepwater Horizon Oil Spill|url=http://journals.plos.org/plosone/article?id=10.1371/journal.pone.0067717|journal=PLOS ONE|volume=8|issue=6|pages=e67717|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0067717|issn=1932-6203}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Deepwater Horizon oil spill]] in 2010, these EPS-producing bacteria were able to grow and multiply rapidly.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; &amp;nbsp;It was later found that their EPSs dissolved the oil and formed oil aggregates on the ocean surface, which sped up the cleaning process.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; These oil aggregates also &amp;nbsp;provided a valuable source of nutrients for other marine microbial communities. This let scientists modify and optimize the use of EPSs to clean up oil spills.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;

'''Flexoelectricity''' is a property of a [[dielectric]] material whereby it exhibits a spontaneous electrical polarization induced by a [[Deformation_(mechanics)#Strain|strain]] gradient. Flexoelectricity is closely related to [[piezoelectricity]], but while piezoelectricity refers to polarization due to uniform strain, flexoelectricity refers specifically to polarization due to strain that changes from point to point in the material. This nonuniform strain breaks [[centrosymmetry]], meaning that unlike in piezoelectiricty, flexoelectric effects can occur in centrosymmetric crystal structures.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=Flexoelectric Effect in Solids|journal = Annual Review of Materials Research|volume = 43|pages = 387–421|author= Pavlo Zubko, Gustau Catalan, and Alexander K. Tagantsev|date=2013|doi = 10.1146/annurev-matsci-071312-121634|hdl = 10261/99362}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flexoelectricity is not the same as [[Ferroelasticity]].

The electric polarization due to mechanical [[Stress_(mechanics)|stress]] in a dielectric is given by
:&lt;math&gt;P_i=d_{ijk}\sigma_{jk}+\mu_{ijkl}\frac{\partial\epsilon_{jk}}{\partial x_l}&lt;/math&gt;

where the first term corresponds to the direct [[piezoelectricity|piezoelectric]] effect and the second term corresponds to the flexoelectric polarization induced by the strain gradient.

Here, the flexoelectric coefficient, &lt;math&gt;\mu_{ijkl}&lt;/math&gt;, is a fourth-rank polar tensor and &lt;math&gt;d_{ijk}&lt;/math&gt; is the coefficient corresponding to the direct piezoelectric effect.

The '''Ford Nucleon''' is a [[concept car]] developed by [[Ford Motor Company|Ford]] in 1957 designed as a future [[nuclear-powered car]], one of a handful of such designs during the 1950s and '60s. The concept was only demonstrated as a scale model. The design did not include an [[internal-combustion engine]]; rather, the vehicle was to be powered by a small [[nuclear reactor]] in the rear of the vehicle, based on the assumption that this would one day be possible by reducing sizes. The car was to use a steam engine powered by [[nuclear fission|uranium fission]] similar to those found in [[nuclear submarine]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.damninteresting.com/?p=656 | last=Bellows | first=Alan | date=27 Aug 2006 | title= The Atomic Automobile | publisher=Damn Interesting | accessdate=8 Jan 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The mock-up of the car can be viewed at the [[The Henry Ford|Henry Ford Museum]] in [[Dearborn, Michigan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.roadsideamerica.com/story/2120 |title=The Henry Ford, America's Greatest History Attraction |accessdate=20 Mar 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Design concept==
At the time of the concept's unveiling, nuclear technology was relatively new and it was believed that soon nuclear-fission  technology could be made compact and affordable such that nuclear fuel would become the primary energy source in the U.S. and gasoline would become obsolete.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Transportation | author=Morris, Neil | year=2010 | isbn=978-1410939111 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=EoExSw2QMXQC | page=13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ford envisioned a future where gas stations would be replaced with full service recharging stations, and that the vehicle would get 5000 miles before the reactor would have to be swapped out for a new one.  These would be scaled down versions of the nuclear reactors that military submarines used at the time, utilizing uranium as the fissile material.  Because the entire reactor would be replaced, Ford hypothesized that the owner would have multiple choices for reactors, such as a fuel efficient model or a high performance model, at each reactor change.  Ultimately, the reactor would use heat to convert water into steam and the power train would be steam driven.&lt;ref name="bellows"&gt;{{cite book|title=Alien Hand Syndrome: And Other Too-Weird-Not-to-Be-True Stories|last=Bellows|first=Alan|publisher=Workman Publishing|date=2009|isbn=978-0-7611-5225-5|pp=168|chapter=The Nucleon - Ford Motor Company's vision for an atomic-age wonder-car}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The Nucleon is the inspiration for nuclear cars in the ''[[Fallout (series)|Fallout]]'' video game franchise.&lt;ref name="nuke"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.autoblog.com/2014/07/17/nuclear-powered-atomic-age-classic-cars/|title=Nuclear-powered concept cars from the Atomic Age|last=Marquis|first=Erin|date=July 17, 2014|accessdate=March 11, 2018|publisher=Autoblog.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, in-game billboards describe the fictional Chryslus Corvega Atomic V8 as having an "Atomic V8" engine.

The '''freestream''' is the [[Atmosphere of Earth|air]] far upstream of an [[Aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] body, that is, before the body has a chance to deflect, slow down or compress the air.  Freestream conditions are usually denoted with a &lt;math&gt;\infty&lt;/math&gt; symbol, e.g. &lt;math&gt;V_\infty&lt;/math&gt;, meaning the freestream velocity

'''George Nicholas Hatsopoulos''' (January 7, 1927 – September 20, 2018) was a [[Greek American]] mechanical engineer noted for his work in [[thermodynamics]] and for having co-founded [[Thermo Electron]].

==Early life==
Hatsopoulos was born in Athens, Greece in 1927&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=zecLAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22HATSOPOULOS,+GEORGE+NICHOLAS,+*%22+1927&amp;dq=%22HATSOPOULOS,+GEORGE+NICHOLAS,+*%22+1927&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=fZiHVJSDN8n0oAStmYLIBQ&amp;ved=0CBwQ6AEwAA]&lt;/ref&gt; and is related to{{how|date=June 2016}} the former rector of the [[Athens Polytechnic School]], [[Nicolas Kitsikis]]. He attended Athens Polytechnic before entering MIT, where received his Bachelor and Master of Science (1950), Mechanical Engineer (1954), and Doctorate of Science (1956).&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;MIT. (1956) Appointments To Administrative Positions And Four Faculty Changes Announced. ''The Tech.'' '''LXXVI''' No. 15, 3 http://tech.mit.edu/V76/PDF/N15.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hatsopoulos-Keenan reformulation of thermodynamics==

In 1965, he and [[Joseph Henry Keenan|Joseph Keenan]] published their textbook ''Principles of General Thermodynamics'', which restates the [[second law of thermodynamics]] in terms of the existence of stable equilibrium states.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Hatsopoulos | first = George, N. | author2 = Keenan, Joseph, H. | title = Principles of General Thermodynamics | publisher = John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc. | year = 1965 | id = CCN 65-12709}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their formulation of the second law of thermodynamics states that:

&lt;div style="font-size:115%"&gt;
{{cquote|When an isolated system performs a process after the removal of a series of internal constraints, it will reach a unique state of equilibrium: this state of equilibrium is independent of the order in which the constraints are removed.}}&lt;/div&gt;

The Hatsopoulos-Keenan statement of the Second Law entails the Clausius, Kelvin-Planck, and Carathéodory statements of the Second Law,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Gyftopoulos | first = Elias, P. |author2=Beretta, Gian Paolo | title = Thermodynamics. Foundations and Applications | publisher = Dover Pu., Inc. | year = 2005 | isbn = 0-486-43932-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; and has provided a basis to extend the traditional definition of [[entropy]] to the non-equilibrium domain.

In 1976, Hatsopoulos also contributed to a formulation of a unified theory of mechanics and thermodynamics, arguably a precursor of the emerging field of quantum thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., http://www.quantumthermodynamics.org&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
While at MIT, Hatsopoulos was head of the Engineering Division of [[Matrad Corporation]] (New York).&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; Matrad Corporation and MIT financially supported his doctoral thesis, ''The Thermo-Electron Engine''.&lt;ref&gt;Hatsopoulos, George Nicholas.

In 1996, Hatsopoulos won the [[John Fritz Medal]], which is the highest American award in the [[engineering]] profession and presented each year for scientific or industrial achievement in any field of pure or applied science. In 1997 he was awarded the 3rd Annual [[Heinz Award]] in Technology, the Economy and Employment.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heinzawards.net/recipients/george-hatsopoulos The Heinz Awards, George Hatsopoulos  profile]&lt;/ref&gt; Mr. Hatsopoulos is also a recipient of The International Center in New York's Award of Excellence.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8836">The '''Grüneisen parameter''', γ, named after [[Eduard Grüneisen]], describes the effect that changing the volume of a [[crystal lattice]] has on its [[phonon|vibrational properties]], and, as a consequence, the effect that changing temperature has on the size or dynamics of the [[crystal lattice|lattice]]. The term is usually reserved to describe the single thermodynamic property γ, which is  a weighted average of the many separate parameters γ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; entering the original Grüneisen's formulation in terms of the [[phonon]] nonlinearities.&lt;ref name="Grüneisen"&gt;{{Citation

__TOC__

== Thermodynamic definitions ==
Because of the equivalences between many properties and derivatives within thermodynamics (e.g. see [[Maxwell Relations]]), there are many formulations of the Grüneisen parameter which are equally valid, leading to numerous distinct yet correct interpretations of its meaning.

Some formulations for the Grüneisen parameter include:

&lt;math&gt;\gamma = V \left(\frac{dP}{dE}\right)_V = \frac{\alpha K_T}{C_V \rho} = \frac{\alpha K_S}{C_P \rho} = \frac{\alpha v_s^2}{C_P}&lt;/math&gt;

where V is volume, &lt;math&gt;C_P&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;C_V&lt;/math&gt; are the principal (i.e. per-mass) heat capacities at constant pressure and volume, E is energy, α is the volume [[thermal expansion|thermal expansion coefficient]], &lt;math&gt;K_S&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;K_T&lt;/math&gt; are the adiabatic and isothermal [[compressibility|bulk moduli]], &lt;math&gt;v_s&lt;/math&gt; is the speed of sound in the medium, and ρ is density. The Grüneisen parameter is dimensionless.

== Grüneisen constant for perfect crystals with pair interactions ==

The expression for the Grüneisen constant of a perfect crystal with pair interactions in &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt;-dimensional space has the form:&lt;ref name=Krivtsov_Kuzkin&gt;{{Citation

&lt;/math&gt;

where  &lt;math&gt;\Pi&lt;/math&gt; is the [[interatomic potential]], &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; is the equilibrium distance, &lt;math&gt;d&lt;/math&gt; is the space dimensionality.

The expression for the Grüneisen constant of a 1D chain with Mie potential exactly coincides with the results of MacDonald and Roy.&lt;ref name=McDonald_Roy&gt;{{Citation

Using the relation between Grüneisen parameter and interatomic potential one can derive the simple necessary and sufficient condition for [[Negative thermal expansion|Negative Thermal Expansion]] in perfect crystals with pair interactions

&lt;math&gt;
    \Pi'''(a)a &gt;  -(d-1)\Pi''(a).
&lt;/math&gt;

== Microscopic definition via the phonon frequencies==

The physical meaning of the parameter can also be extended by combining thermodynamics with a reasonable [[microphysics]] model for the vibrating atoms within a crystal. 
When the restoring force acting on an atom displaced from its equilibrium position is [[Proportionality (mathematics)|linear]] in the atom's displacement, the frequencies ω&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; of individual [[phonon]]s do not depend on the volume of the crystal or on the presence of other phonons, and the thermal expansion (and thus γ) is zero. When the restoring force is non-linear in the displacement, the phonon frequencies ω&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; change with the volume &lt;math&gt;V&lt;/math&gt;. The Grüneisen parameter of an individual vibrational mode &lt;math&gt;i&lt;/math&gt; can then be defined as (the negative of) the logarithmic derivative of the corresponding frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega_i&lt;/math&gt;:

&lt;math&gt;\gamma_i= - \frac{V}{\omega_i} \frac{\partial \omega_i}{\partial V}. &lt;/math&gt;

== Relationship between microscopic and thermodynamic models ==
Using the [[quasi-harmonic approximation]] for atomic vibrations, the macroscopic Grüneisen parameter (γ) can be related to the description of how the vibration frequencies ([[phonons]]) within a crystal are altered with changing volume (i.e. γ&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt;'s). 
For example, one can show that

&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{\alpha K_T}{C_V \rho}&lt;/math&gt;

if one defines &lt;math&gt;\gamma &lt;/math&gt; as the weighted average

&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \frac{\sum_i \gamma_i c_{V,i} }{ \sum_i c_{V,i} }, &lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt; c_{V,i}&lt;/math&gt;'s are the partial vibrational mode contributions to the heat capacity, such that &lt;math&gt;C_{V} = \frac{1}{\rho V} \sum_i c_{V,i} .&lt;/math&gt;

===Proof===
To prove this relation, it is easiest to introduce the heat capacity per particle &lt;math&gt;\tilde{C}_V = \sum_i c_{V,i}&lt;/math&gt;; so one can write

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\sum_i \gamma_i c_{V,i}}{\tilde{C}_V} = \frac{\alpha K_T}{C_V \rho} = \frac{\alpha V K_T}{\tilde{C}_V}&lt;/math&gt;.

This way, it suffices to prove

&lt;math&gt;\sum_i \gamma_i c_{V,i} = \alpha V K_T&lt;/math&gt;.

Left-hand side (def):

&lt;math&gt;\sum_i \gamma_i c_{V,i} = \sum_i \left[- \frac{V}{\omega_i} \frac{\partial \omega_i}{ \partial V} \right] \left[ k_B \left(\frac{\hbar \omega_i}{k_B T}\right)^2 \frac{\exp\left( \frac{\hbar \omega_i}{k_B T} \right)}{\left[\exp\left(\frac{\hbar \omega_i}{k_B T}\right) - 1\right]^2} \right]&lt;/math&gt;

Right-hand side (def):

&lt;math&gt;\alpha V K_T = \left[ \frac{1}{V} \left(\frac{\partial V}{ \partial T}\right)_P \right] V \left[-V \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial V}\right)_T\right] = - V \left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial T} \right)_P \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial V}\right)_T&lt;/math&gt;

Furthermore ([[Maxwell relations]]):

&lt;math&gt;\left( \frac{\partial V}{\partial T} \right)_P = \frac{\partial}{\partial T} \left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial P}\right)_T = \frac{\partial}{\partial P} \left(\frac{\partial G}{\partial T}\right)_P = - \left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial P} \right)_T&lt;/math&gt;

Thus

&lt;math&gt;\alpha V K_T = V \left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial P} \right)_T \left(\frac{\partial P}{\partial V}\right)_T = V \left( \frac{\partial S}{\partial V} \right)_T&lt;/math&gt;

This derivative is straightforward to determine in the [[quasi-harmonic approximation]], as only the ω&lt;sub&gt;i&lt;/sub&gt; are ''V''-dependent.

&lt;math&gt;\frac{\partial S}{\partial V} = \frac{\partial }{\partial V} \left\{ - \sum_i k_B \ln\left[ 1 - \exp\left( -\frac{\hbar\omega_i (V)}{k_BT} \right) \right] + \sum_i \frac{1}{T} \frac{\hbar\omega_i (V)}{\exp\left(\frac{\hbar\omega_i (V)}{k_BT}\right) - 1} \right\}&lt;/math&gt;

&lt;math&gt;V \frac{\partial S}{\partial V} = - \sum_i \frac{V}{\omega_i} \frac{\partial \omega_i}{\partial V} \;\; k_B \left(\frac{\hbar \omega_i}{k_BT}\right)^2 \frac{\exp\left( \frac{\hbar \omega_i}{k_B T} \right)}{\left[\exp\left(\frac{\hbar \omega_i}{k_B T}\right) - 1\right]^2} = \sum_i \gamma_i c_{V,i}&lt;/math&gt;

This yields

&lt;math&gt;\gamma = \dfrac{\sum_i \gamma_i c_{V,i}}{\sum_i c_{V,i}} = \dfrac{\alpha V K_T}{\tilde{C}_V}.&lt;/math&gt;

      <model>wikitext</model>
      <format>text/x-wiki</format>
      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6180">[[Pierre Huglin]] developed a bioclimatic heat index for [[vineyard]]s, the '''Huglin heat sum index''' (or ''after Huglin'' respectively '''-warmth index''' or short '''Huglin index,''') in which the temperature sum over the temperature threshold of 10&amp;nbsp;°C is calculated and then summed for all days from beginning of April to end of September. The calculation uses both the daily average temperatures and the maximum temperatures and slightly modifies the calculated total according to latitude. Each [[grape variety]] needs a certain amount of heat in order to be cultivated successfully in the long term in a given area. The calculated heat sums, which are based on data from [[weather stations]] or from [[climate models]], differ in that they are too low compared to the actual values in the vineyards. The index does not take into account e.g. thermally favoured hillsides where temperature values may be higher by about 1.5&amp;nbsp;°C to 2&amp;nbsp;°C.

== Definition &amp; Calculation ==

The Huglin index is calculated as a product of the coefficient ''K'' and the sum of the arithmetic mean of daily mean- and daily maximum temperatures relative to the baseline temperature of 10&amp;nbsp;°C (taking into account all days from 1st&amp;nbsp;April till 30th&amp;nbsp;September):

== Consequences of changes in the Huglin index ==

Due to [[climate change]], the Huglin index will continue to rise over coming decades, and the suitability of an area for a specific grape variety will continue to change.&lt;ref&gt;AgriCLASS Project: ''https://agriclass.climate.copernicus.eu/viticulture Viticulture Case Study'' (web site, part of Copernicus C3S)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Hans Reiner Schultz]], Dieter Hoppmann, Marco Hofmann: ''[http://www.hlug.de/static/klimawandel/inklim/dokumente/endberichte/weinbau.pdf Der Einfluss klimatischer Veränderungen auf die phänologische Entwicklung der Rebe, die Sorteneignung sowie Mostgewicht und Säurestruktur der Trauben.Beitrag zum Integrierten Klimaschutzprogramm des Landes Hessen (InKlim 2012) des Fachgebiets Weinbau der Forschungsanstalt Geisenheim],'' Geisenheim 2005, S.&amp;nbsp;12&amp;nbsp;f./32&amp;nbsp;ff.

Active [[thermography]] is an advanced [[nondestructive testing]] procedure, which uses a thermography measurement of a tested material thermal response after its external excitation. This principle can be used also for non-contact '''infrared non-destructive testing (IRNDT) of materials'''. The IRNDT&lt;ref name="irndt"&gt;[http://ttp.zcu.cz/en/laboratories/irndt/active-thermography Active thermography laboratory, University of West Bohemia, New Technologies - Research Centre, department Thermomechanics of Technological Processes]&lt;/ref&gt; method is based on an excitation of a tested material by an external source, which brings some energy to the material. [[Halogen lamp|Halogen lamps]], [[Flash-lamp|flash-lamps]], [[ultrasound generator]] or other sources can be used as the excitation source for the IRNDT. The excitation causes a tested material thermal response, which is measured by an [[Thermographic camera|infrared camera]]. It is possible to obtain information about the tested material surface and sub-surface defects or material inhomogeneities by using a suitable combination of excitation source, excitation procedure, infrared camera and evaluation method.

Modern thermographic systems with high-speed and high-sensitivity IR cameras extend the possibilities of the inspection method. Modularity of the systems allows their usage for research and development applications as well as in modern industrial production lines.

Thermovision nondestructive testing of components can be carried out on a wide range of various materials. Thermographic inspection of material can be regarded as a method of infrared defectoscopy, that is capable of revealing material imperfections such as cracks, defects, voids, cavities and other inhomogeneities. The thermographic testing can be provided on individual components in a laboratory or directly on technology facilities that are in duty.

== Introduction to infrared thermography ==

Infrared (IR) thermography&lt;ref name="thermography"&gt;[http://ttp.zcu.cz/en/laboratories/thermal-fields Laboratory of thermal fields measurement, University of West Bohemia, New Technologies - Research Centre, department Thermomechanics of Technological Processes]&lt;/ref&gt; is an analysis technique based on the detection of radiation in the IR [[wavelength spectrum]]. According to the black body radiation law, all objects with temperature greater than absolute zero emit IR radiation. The device detecting and composing a 2D image of the IR radiation is generally called an IR camera or a thermographic camera, also referred to as an infrared camera. The result of the thermographic recording is an image or a sequence, which corresponds to the intensity of the thermal radiation of the recorded object. The recording is called a [[Thermography|thermogram]]. The intensity of the thermal radiation of the object is directly connected with the object temperature. The thermogram is therefore an image of the object surface temperature distribution. IR thermography is in the most cases used for non-contact measurement of spatial and time distribution of temperature fields.

[[File:IRNDT fig 01 en.png|thumb|Scheme of the principles and factors influencing a thermographic measurement.]]

=== Properties ===

IR thermography has a number of advantages – it is non-contact measurement, it captures an area (similarly to the classical video camera in visible spectrum) or it can measure moving or rotating objects, even if the objects have a very high temperature. However, it should be noted that the IR radiation intensity detected by the infrared camera does not depend solely on the measured object temperature. The main drawback of IR thermography is the fact that the result is influenced by a number of factors such as the thermo-optical properties of the object (emissivity, transmissivity, reflectivity),&lt;ref name="optical properties"&gt;[http://ttp.zcu.cz/en/laboratories/optical-properties/optical-properties Laboratory of optical properties measurement, University of West Bohemia, New Technologies - Research Centre, department Thermomechanics of Technological Processes]&lt;/ref&gt; ambient temperature, environment properties, etc. Especially the knowledge of the measured object optical properties are fundamental for an accurate temperature measurement. Determination of these properties is often a complicated task and it requires experiences and an appropriate equipment.

=== Classification ===

Thermography can be classified as qualitative or quantitative, and passive or active. Qualitative thermography usually does not require an accurate temperature measurement. It only evaluates temperature differences between particular components, between different spots on the same object or between the measured object and the background. Qualitative thermography has many important applications, for example a thermal leaks diagnostics, thermal components diagnostics, searching for persons or in medicine. In contrast, the goal of quantitative thermography is an accurate temperature measurement of inspected objects. Knowledge of thermo-optical properties of the measured objects is essential in this case. Moreover, the thermo-optical properties often depend on temperature and it is also necessary to take into account an influence of environment.

Important applications of quantitative thermography include temperature monitoring during thermal processing or determination of thermal boundary conditions for numerical simulations of thermal processes.

Both the qualitative and quantitative approaches can be applied in terms of passive or active thermography. If the object temperature is not artificially affected during its measuring, it is called the passive thermography. If an artificial excitation using an external source is applied on the measured object, it is called active thermography. The external excitation causes temperature contrasts associated with material inhomogeneities or defects occurrence or it can be used for material properties identification. The active thermography is the important technique used for finding defects in materials, so called infrared non-destructive testing (IRNDT). Active thermography can be also applied for material thermal properties determination.

== Infrared non-destructive testing (IRNDT) ==

=== Active thermography ===

[[File:IRNDT fig 02 en.png|thumb|Scheme of the active thermography principle.]]

Active thermography uses an external source for measured object excitation, that means introducing an energy into the object. The excitation sources can be classified by the principles:

* optical radiation or microwaves absorption,
* electromagnetic induction,
* elastic waves transformation (e.g. ultrasound),
* convection (e.g. hot air),
* plastic deformation transformation (thermoplastic effect during mechanical loading).

Various excitation sources can be used for the active thermography and nondestructive testing, for example laser heating, flash lamps, halogen lamps, [[Electric heating|electrical heating]], [[ultrasonic excitation]], [[Eddy current|eddy currents]], [[Microwave|microwaves]], and others. The measured object can be heated by an external source directly, e.g. by halogen lamps or hot air. The material inhomogeneities or defects cause then a distortion of temperature field. This distortion is detected as temperature differences on the material surface. Another possibility is to use thermophysical processes in the material, when mechanical or electrical energy is transformed into thermal energy due to defects and inhomogeneities. It creates local temperature sources, which cause temperature differences detected on the object surface by infrared techniques. It is the case of ultrasound excitation for example.

=== IRNDT methods ===

A lot of methods were developed for active thermography for the nondestructive testing measurement evaluation. The evaluation methods selection depends on application, used excitation source and excitation type (pulse, periodic, continuous). In the simplest case, the response is evident from a thermogram directly. However, it is necessary to use advanced analysis techniques in most cases. The most common methods include Lock-In, Pulse or Transient (Step thermography) evaluation techniques. Continuous excitation can also be used in some cases.

* Lock-In thermography (periodic excitation method). A modulated periodic source is used for the excitation. The phase and amplitude shift of the measured signal are evaluated and the analysis can be done by various techniques. Halogen lamps, [[LED lamp|LED lamps]], ultrasound excitation or an electric current are suitable excitation sources. It has the advantage that it can be used on large surfaces and it puts a low thermal energy on the part being inspected. The disadvantage is a longer measurement time and dependence of detection capabilities on a geometrical orientation of defects (except of an indirect excitation such as ultrasound). The Lock-In method is suitable for testing components with a low thermal diffusivity and it has many modifications for various specific applications (such as Lock-In Ref, Lock-In Online, etc.).
* Pulse thermography (pulse method). A very short pulse – usually in the units of milliseconds – is used to excite the object. The cooling process is then analyzed. A flash lamp is typically used as an excitation source. The advantage of this method is the speed of the analysis and a possibility to estimate the defects depth. The disadvantage is a limited depth of the analysis, a limited area that can be inspected (with regard to a usable power of excitation sources) and a dependence of detection capabilities on geometrical orientation of defects.
* Transient thermography (step thermography, thermal wave method). In principle, the excitation and evaluation are similar to the pulse thermography, however, the pulse length is much bigger. Less powerful excitation sources are required compared to the pulse thermography. It is therefore possible to analyze larger areas and the measurement time is shorter than in the case of Lock-In thermography. As in the pulse thermography, the sensitivity of the method is limited by the geometrical orientation of defects. Halogen lamps are the suitable excitation source for this type of evaluation.
* Continual excitation. The simplest method usable only in special applications.

A high-speed cooled infrared camera with a high sensitivity is commonly used for IRNDT applications. However, an uncooled bolometric infrared camera can be used for specific applications. It can significantly reduce acquisition costs of the measurement system.

The IR nondestructive testing system  are usually modular. It means that various excitation sources can be combined with various infrared cameras and various evaluation methods depending on application, tested material, measuring time demands, size of a tested area, etc. The modularity allows universal usage of the system for various industrial, scientific and research applications.

== Application examples ==

IRNDT (infra-red nondestructive testing) method is suitable for detection and inspection of cracks, defects, cavities, voids and inhomogeneities in material, it is also possible to use the method for  inspection of welded joints of metal and plastic parts, inspection of [[Solar cell|solar cells]] and [[Solar panel|solar panels]],  determination of internal structure of material etc.

The main advantage of IRNDT method is availability for inspection of various materials in wide range of industrial and research applications.  IRNDT measurement is fast, nondestructive and noncontact. Restrictive condition for IRNDT method is inspection depth combined with dimension and orientation of defect/crack/inhomogeneity in material.

=== Pulse IRNDT analysis of a demonstration sample ===

[[File:IRNDT fig 03 en.jpg|thumb|Demonstration of tested specimen and IRNDT analysis results.]]

The demonstration and calibration sample is made of carbon fiber-epoxy composite. There are six holes of different depths on one side to simulate defects at different depths in range from 1 to 4&amp;nbsp;mm under the surface. The IRNDT analysis is performed from the flat side.

The results from the flash-pulse analysis show that the holes appear in different time frames of the evaluation – according to their depth. So the flash-pulse analysis does not only detect the presence of defects but also determine their depth under the surface if a thermal diffusivity of the sample is known.

=== Inspection of laser welded plastic parts ===

[[File:IRNDT fig 04 en.jpg|thumb|IRNDT analysis of laser welded plastic part with a defective weld and with a correct weld.]]

Laser welding of plastics is a progressive technology of connecting materials with different optical properties. Classical methods for testing of welding performance and weld joints quality – such as the metallographic cut microscopic analysis or [[X-ray]] [[tomography]] – are not suitable for routine measurements. Pulse IRNDT analysis can be successfully used for weld inspection in many cases.

The images show an example of plastic parts inspection with a defective weld and with a correct weld. The gaps in the defective weld and the correct uninterrupted weld line are both well visible in the results of the IRNDT flash-pulse analysis.

=== Inspection of laser welded joints ===

[[File:IRNDT fig 05 en.jpg|thumb|IRNDT evaluation with an indication  of weld imperfections and a correct weld of lap joint.]]

[[Laser beam welding]] is a modern technology of fusion welding. Currently finds its wide usage not only in the field of scientific research but also establishes itself in a variety of industries. Among the most frequent users belong the automotive industry, which due to its stable continuous innovation enables fast implementation of advanced technologies in their production. It is clear that laser welding significantly enhances engineering designs and thus brings a number of new products which previously could not be made by conventional methods.

The [[Laser beam welding|laser welding]] can produce quality welds of different types, both extremely thin and thick blanks. Weldable are common [[Carbon steel|carbon steels]], [[Stainless steel|stainless steels]], [[Aluminium|aluminum]] and its alloys, [[copper]], [[titanium]] and last but not least, special materials and its combinations.

An integral part of the weldments production is a quality control. Unlike conventional non-destructive test methods, IRNDT is used not only after the laser welding process, but also during it. This makes possible to decide whether or not to the weldment comply with established quality criteria during manufacture process.

[[File:LatheDrivePlate-carriers.jpg|thumb|Dead center (the conical piece) mounted in the spindle of a lathe and being used to support a workpiece being driven by a [[Lathe dog|carrier]] setup]]

A '''lathe center''', often shortened to '''center''', is a tool that has been ground to a point to accurately position a workpiece on an axis. They usually have an included angle of 60°, but in heavy machining situations an angle of 75° is used.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation | title = International library of technology: Drilling; Lathe work; Boring-mill work; Working chilled iron; Bench, vise, and floor work; Erecting | page = 21 | publisher = International Textbook | year = 1914 | volume = 138 | url = https://books.google.com/books?id=_Q9WAAAAMAAJ&amp;dq=%22lathe%20center%22&amp;pg=RA2-PA21 | postscript =.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The primary use of a center is to ensure [[concentric]] work is produced; this allows the workpiece to be transferred between machining (or inspection) operations without any loss of accuracy. A part may be ''turned'' in a [[lathe]], sent off for [[Hardening (metallurgy)|hardening]] and tempering and then ground ''between centers'' in a [[cylindrical grinder]]. The preservation of concentricity between the turning and grinding operations is crucial for quality work.

A center is also used to support longer workpieces where the [[tool bit|cutting]] forces would deflect the work excessively, reducing the finish and accuracy of the workpiece, or creating a hazardous situation.

A center lathe has applications anywhere that a ''centered'' workpiece may be used; this is not limited to lathe usage but may include setups in [[indexing head|dividing head]]s, cylindrical grinders, [[tool and cutter grinder]]s or other related equipment. The term ''between centers'' refers to any machining operation where the job needs to be performed using centers.

A center is inserted into a matching hole drilled by a [[Drill bit#Centre Drill Bits|center drill]]. The hole is conical near and at the surface, and cylindrical, deeper.

== Dead center ==
[[File:CenterLiveDead.jpg|thumb|right|150px|Revolving center (top) Dead center with carbide insert (bottom)]]

A '''dead center''' (one that does not turn freely, i.e., ''dead'') may be used to support the workpiece at either the fixed or rotating end of the machine. When used in the fixed position, a dead center produces friction between the workpiece and center, due to the rotation of the workpiece. Lubrication is therefore required between the center and workpiece to prevent [[friction welding]] from occurring. Additionally the tip of the center may have an insert of cemented [[tungsten carbide|carbide]] which will reduce the friction slightly and allow for faster speeds.  Dead centers are typically fully hardened to prevent damage to the important mating surfaces of the [[Machine taper#Morse|taper]] and to preserve the 60° angle of the nose.  As tungsten carbide is much harder than steel, a carbide-tipped center has greater wear resistance than a steel center.

== Soft center ==
'''Soft centers''' are a special version of the dead center in which the nose is deliberately left soft (unhardened) so that it may be readily machined to the correct angle prior to usage. This operation is performed on the headstock center to ensure that the center's axis is aligned with the spindle's axis.

== Live or revolving center ==
A '''revolving center''', also known as a '''live center''' in some countries, is constructed so that the 60° center runs in its own bearings and is used at the non-driven or [[Lathe (metal)#Tailstock|tailstock]] end of a machine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Culley| first =Ron|title = Fitting and machining| publisher = RMIT Publications | date =1997|origyear=1988 | location = PO Box 12477, Melbourne, Victoria| url = http://rmitpublishing.com.au/|isbn = 0-7241-3819-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt; It allows higher turning speeds without the need for separate lubrication, and also greater clamping pressures. [[lathe (metal)#CNC|CNC lathes]] use this type of center almost exclusively and they may be used for general machining operations as well. Spring-loaded centers are designed to compensate for center variations, without damage to the work piece or center tip. This assures the operator of uniform constant tension while machining. Some live centers also have interchangeable shafts. This is valuable when situations require a design other than a 60° male tip. A '''live center''', which may be hard or soft, is a plain center placed in the revolving mandrel; it moves and is therefore '''live'''.

== Pipe center ==
A '''pipe center''', also known as a '''bull nose center''' is a type of live center which has a large diameter conical nose rather than a sharp point. This allows the center to be used in the bore of a pipe or other workpiece with a large interior diameter. While a pipe center ensures the workpiece remains concentric, its main advantage is that it supports the workpiece securely, and can be used for parts whose larger inner diameter prevents the use of a normal pointed center. Thin-walled material such as pipes easily collapses if excessive force is used at the [[Chuck (engineering)#Three jaw|chuck]] end.

== Cup center ==
There are two types of '''cup centers'''.  The woodworking variety is a variation of the traditional live center.  This type of cup center has a central point like a normal live center and also has a ring surrounding it.  The ring supports the softer material around the center point and prevents the wood from splitting under pressure from the central point.  A different variety of cup center is used for metalworking.  The metalworking variety of cup center has a tapered hole rather than a conical point.  It supports the part by making contact with the outside diameter of the end of the part, rather than using a center hole.

A '''drive center''', also known as a '''grip center''', is used in the driving end of a machine (headstock). It is often used in woodworking or where softer materials are machined.

It consists of a dead center surrounded by hardened teeth, which bite into a softer workpiece allowing the workpiece to be driven directly by the center. This allows the full diameter of the workpiece to be machined in a single operation, in contrast with the usual requirement where a [[lathe carrier|carrier]] is attached to the workpiece at the driven end. The use of modified shell end mills in a drive center, instead of hardened pins, enables better gripping and prevents breakdown time due to pin stop.{{cn|date=September 2017}}

== Spring center ==
A '''spring center''' is a metalworking lathe center for maintaining a cutting tool like a reamer or a tap, in axial alignment with a hole being worked on. It consists of a point backed by a spring to push the cutting tool into the workpiece.

==Lattice energy vs lattice enthalpy==
The lattice energy is exothermic, i.e., the value of ''ΔH&lt;sub&gt;lattice&lt;/sub&gt;'' is negative because it corresponds to the coalescing of infinitely separated gaseous ions in [[vacuum]] to form the ionic lattice. The lattice ''enthalpy'' is reported as a positive value.

[[File:Sodium-chloride-3D-ionic.png|thumb|right|Sodium chloride crystal lattice]]
The concept of lattice energy was originally developed for [[rocksalt]]-structured and [[sphalerite]]-structured compounds like [[Sodium chloride|NaCl]] and [[Zinc sulfide|ZnS]], where the ions occupy high-symmetry crystal lattice sites. In the case of NaCl, lattice energy is the energy released by the reaction
: Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; (g) + Cl&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (g) &amp;rarr; NaCl (s)
which would amount to -786 kJ/mol.&lt;ref name="Johnson"/&gt;

Some textbooks &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Zumdahl|first=Steven S.|title=Chemistry|year=1997|publisher=Houghton Mifflin|location=Boston|isbn=0-669-41794-7|pages=357–358|edition=4th}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the commonly used [[CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=CRC handbook of chemistry and physics : a ready-reference book of chemical and physical data|last=Haynes|first=William M.|last2=Lide|first2=David R.|last3=Bruno|first3=Thomas J.|publisher=CRC Press, Taylor &amp; Francis Group|year=2017|isbn=9781498754293|location=Boca Raton, FL|pages=12-22 to 12-34}}&lt;/ref&gt; define lattice energy with the opposite sign, i.e. the energy required to convert the crystal into infinitely separated gaseous ions in [[vacuum]], an [[endothermic]] process.  Following this convention, the lattice energy of NaCl would be +786 kJ/mol. The lattice energy for [[Ionic compound|ionic]] crystals such as sodium chloride, metals such as iron, or covalently linked materials such as diamond is considerably greater in magnitude than for solids such as sugar or iodine, whose neutral molecules interact only by weaker [[Dipole-dipole force|dipole-dipole]] or [[van der Waals force]]s.

==Theoretical treatments==
The relationship between the molar lattice energy and the molar '''lattice enthalpy''' is given by the following equation:
:&lt;math&gt;\Delta _G U=\Delta _G H -p\Delta V_m&lt;/math&gt;, 
where &lt;math&gt;\Delta _G U&lt;/math&gt; is the molar lattice energy, &lt;math&gt;\Delta _G H&lt;/math&gt; the molar lattice enthalpy and &lt;math&gt;\Delta V_m&lt;/math&gt; the change of the volume per mole. Therefore, the lattice [[enthalpy]] further takes into account that work has to be performed against an outer pressure &lt;math&gt;p&lt;/math&gt;. 

The lattice energy of an ionic compound depends upon charges of the ions that comprise the solid. More subtly, the relative and absolute sizes of the ions influence  ''ΔH&lt;sub&gt;lattice&lt;/sub&gt;''.


===Born–Landé equation===
{{main|Born–Landé equation}}
In 1918&lt;ref&gt;I.D. Brown, ''The chemical Bond in Inorganic Chemistry'', IUCr monographs in crystallography, Oxford University Press, 2002, {{ISBN|0-19-850870-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Max Born|Born]] and [[Alfred Landé|Landé]] proposed that the lattice energy could be derived from the [[electric potential]] of the ionic lattice and a repulsive [[potential energy]] term.&lt;ref name = "Johnson"&gt;David Arthur Johnson, ''Metals and Chemical Change'', Open University, Royal Society of Chemistry, 2002,{{ISBN|0-85404-665-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;E = -\frac{N_AMz^+z^- q_e^2 }{4 \pi \varepsilon_0 r_0}\left(1-\frac{1}{n}\right),&lt;/math&gt;
where

:''N''&lt;sub&gt;A&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[Avogadro constant]];
:''M'' is the [[Madelung constant]], relating to the geometry of the crystal;
:''z''&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; is the charge number of cation;
:''z''&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; is the charge number of anion;
:''q''&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[elementary charge]], equal to {{val|1.6022|e=-19|u=C}};
:''ε''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the [[permittivity of free space]], equal to {{val|8.854|e=-12|u=C&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; J&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; m&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;}};
:''r''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; is the distance to closest ion; and
:''n'' is the Born exponent, a number between 5 and 12, determined experimentally by measuring the [[compressibility]] of the solid, or derived theoretically.&lt;ref&gt;Cotton, F. Albert; Wilkinson, Geoffrey; (1966). Advanced Inorganic Chemistry (2d Edn.) New York:Wiley-Interscience.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Born–Landé equation]] shows that the lattice energy of a compound depends on a number of factors
* as the charges on the ions increase the lattice energy increases (becomes more negative),
* when ions are closer together the lattice energy increases (becomes more negative)
Barium oxide (BaO), for instance, which has the NaCl structure and therefore the same Madelung constant, has a bond radius of 275 picometers and a lattice energy of -3054 kJ/mol, while sodium chloride (NaCl) has a bond radius of 283 picometers and a lattice energy of -786 kJ/mol.

===Kapustinskii equation===
The [[Kapustinskii equation]] can be used as a simpler way of deriving lattice energies where high precision is not required.&lt;ref name = "Johnson"/&gt;

=== Effect of polarisation ===

For ionic compounds with ions occupying lattice sites with [[crystallographic point groups]] ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''C''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;''&lt;sub&gt;h&lt;/sub&gt;'', ''C&lt;sub&gt;n&lt;/sub&gt;'' or ''C&lt;sub&gt;nv&lt;/sub&gt;'' (''n'' = 2, 3, 4 or 6) the concept of the lattice energy and the Born–Haber cycle has to be extended.&lt;ref name= ZPB1995a&gt;{{cite journal | author = M. Birkholz | title = Crystal-field induced dipoles in heteropolar crystals – I. concept | journal = Z. Phys. B | volume = 96 | pages = 325–332 | year = 1995 | doi = 10.1007/BF01313054 |bibcode = 1995ZPhyB..96..325B | url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/227050494_Crystal-field_induced_dipoles_in_heteropolar_crystals_I_concept}}&lt;/ref&gt; In these cases the [[Ionic polarization|polarization]] energy ''E&lt;sub&gt;pol&lt;/sub&gt;'' associated with ions on polar lattice sites has to be included in the Born–Haber cycle and the solid formation reaction has to start from the already polarized species. As an example, one may consider the case of [[pyrite|iron-pyrite]] FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, where sulfur ions occupy lattice site of point symmetry group ''C''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;. The lattice energy defining reaction then reads

: Fe&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt; (g) + 2 pol S&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; (g) &amp;rarr; FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (s)

where pol S&lt;sup&gt;−&lt;/sup&gt; stands for the polarized, gaseous sulfur ion. It has been shown that the neglection of the effect led to 15% difference between theoretical and experimental thermodynamic cycle energy of FeS&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; that reduced to only 2%, when the sulfur polarization effects were included.&lt;ref name= BJPC1992&gt;{{cite journal|author = M.

[[File:Leadingedgeextensions annotated.svg|thumb|300px|Aircraft wing leading-edge extensions{{snd}}annotated]]
A '''leading-edge extension''' ('''LEX''') is a small extension to an aircraft wing surface, forward of the leading edge. The primary reason for adding an extension is to improve the airflow at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]] and low airspeeds, to improve handling and delay the stall. A dog tooth can also improve airflow and reduce drag at higher speeds.

==Leading–edge slat==
[[File:Airfrance.a318-100.f-gugj.arp.jpg|thumb|[[Leading-edge slat]]s deployed on an [[Airbus A318-100]]]]
{{Main|Leading-edge slat}}
A [[leading-edge slat]] is an [[aerodynamic]] surface running spanwise just ahead of the wing leading edge. It creates a [[leading edge slot]] between the slat and wing which directs air over the wing surface, helping to maintain smooth airflow at low speeds and high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]]. This delays the [[stall (flight)|stall]], allowing the aircraft to fly at a higher angle of attack. Slats may be made fixed, or retractable in normal flight to minimize [[drag (physics)#drag in aerodynamics|drag]].

==Dogtooth extension==
[[File:hawker hunter t7 blue diamond in planform arp.jpg|thumb|Dog tooth on the wing of a [[Hawker Hunter]]]]
A '''dogtooth''' is a small, sharp zig-zag break in the leading edge of a wing. It is usually used on a swept wing, to generate a [[vortex]] flow field to prevent separated flow from progressing outboard at high angle of attack.&lt;ref&gt;''Effects of Wing-Leading-Edge Modifications on a Full-Scale, Low-Wing General Aviation Airplane'', Nasa TP 2011&lt;/ref&gt; The effect is the same as a [[wing fence]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.flightglobal.com/pdfarchive/view/1959/1959%20-%203173.html A Two-seat Gnat Development for the R.A.F.] ''Flight'' 1959&lt;/ref&gt; It can also be used on straight wings in a [[drooped leading edge]] arrangement.{{fact|date=August 2015|reason=Is that really a dog tooth and not a cuff?}}

Where the dogtooth is added as an afterthought, as for example on the [[Hawker Hunter]] and some variants of the [[Quest Kodiak]], the dogtooth is created by adding an extension to the outer section of the leading edge.

==Leading-edge cuff==
[[File:DroopedLeadingEdgeCuff01.JPG|thumb|Experimental drooped leading-edge cuff on an [[American Aviation AA-1 Yankee]]]]
{{Main|Leading-edge cuff}}
A leading edge cuff (or wing cuff) is a fixed [[aerodynamics|aerodynamic]] device employed on fixed-wing [[aircraft]] to introduce a sharp discontinuity in the leading edge of the wing in the same way as a dogtooth. It also typically has a slightly drooped leading edge to improve low-speed characteristics.

==Leading-edge root extension==
[[File:FA18 LEX.jpg|thumb|Condensation vortex flows along the LERX of an F/A-18]]
A leading-edge root extension (LERX) is a small [[fillet (mechanics)|fillet]], typically roughly triangular in shape, running forward from the leading edge of the [[wing root]] to a point along the fuselage.  These are often called simply leading-edge extensions (LEX), although they are not the only kind. To avoid ambiguity, this article uses the term LERX.

On a modern [[fighter aircraft]] LERX induce controlled [[aerodynamics|airflow]] over the wing at high [[angle of attack|angles of attack]], so delaying the stall and consequent loss of lift. In cruising flight the effect of the LERX is minimal. However at high angles of attack, as often encountered in a [[dog fight]] or during takeoff and landing, the LERX generates a high-speed [[vortex]] that attaches to the top of the wing. The vortex action maintains a smooth airflow over the wing surface well past the normal [[stall (flight)|stall]] point at which the airflow would otherwise break up, thus sustaining lift at very high angles.

LERX were first used on the [[Northrop F-5]] "Freedom fighter" which flew in 1959,&lt;ref&gt;Green, W. and Swanborough, G.; ''The complete book of fighters'', Salamander, 1994&lt;/ref&gt; and have since become commonplace on many combat aircraft. The [[F/A-18 Hornet]] has especially large examples, as does the [[Sukhoi Su-27]] and the [[CAC/PAC JF-17 Thunder]]. The Su-27 LERX help make some advanced maneuvers possible, such as the [[Pugachev's Cobra]], the [[Cobra Turn]] and the [[Kulbit]].

A long, narrow sideways extension to the fuselage, attached in this position, is an example of a [[chine (aircraft)|chine]].

==Leading-edge vortex controller ==
Leading-edge vortex controller (LEVCON) systems are a continuation of leading-edge root extension (LERX) technology, but with actuation that allows the leading edge vortices to be modified without adjusting the aircraft's attitude &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Lee |first1=Gwo-Bin |title=Leading-edge Vortices Control on a Delta Wing by Micromachined Sensors and Actuators |url=http://www.las.inpe.br/~jrsenna/AerospaceMEMS/Contr-Ensaios-voo/caltech1.pdf|publisher= American Institute of Aeronautics and Astronautics|accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Otherwise they operate on the same principals as the LERX system to create lift augmenting leading edge vortices during high [[Angle of attack|angle of attack]] flight.

This system has been incorporated in the Russian [[Sukhoi Su-57]] and Indian [[HAL Tejas]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Sweetman |first1=Bill |title=Sukhoi T-50 Shows Flight-Control Innovations |url=http://aviationweek.com/awin/sukhoi-t-50-shows-flight-control-innovations |website=Aviation Week |publisher=Aviation Week &amp; Space Technology |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

The LEVCONs actuation ability also improves its performance over the LERX system in other areas.
When combined with the [[thrust vectoring|thrust vectoring controller]] (TVC), the aircraft controllability at extreme [[angle of attack|angles of attack]] is further increased, which assists in stunts which require [[supermaneuverability]] such as [[Pugachev's Cobra]] &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Singh |first1=Ishan |title=What is the major purpose of LEVCON in an aircraft, aerospace? |url=https://www.quora.com/What-is-the-major-purpose-of-LEVCON-in-an-aircraft-aerospace |website=Quora |accessdate=18 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;.  
Additionally, on the [[Sukhoi Su-57]] the LEVCON system is used for increased [[Departure resistance|departure-resistance]] in the event of [[Thrust vectoring|thrust vectoring controller]] (TVC) failure at a post-stall attitude. It can also be used for trimming the aircraft, and optimizing the lift to drag ratio during cruise.

'''MT ''Bunga Kelana 3''''' is an Aframax tanker built in 1998, owned and operated by [[AET (company)|AET Tanker Holdings]], a subsidiary of [[MISC Berhad|Malaysian International Shipping Corporation (MISC)]] to transport crude oil from [[Bintulu]], [[Sarawak]].&lt;ref name="buswk" /&gt;

A '''mercury-arc valve''' or '''mercury-vapor rectifier''' or (UK) '''mercury-arc rectifier'''&lt;ref&gt;''Electrical Year Book 1937'', Emmott and Company, Manchester, England, pp 180-185&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Rissik, H.,Mercury-Arc Current Converters, Pitman. 1941.&lt;/ref&gt; is a type of electrical [[rectifier]] used for converting high-[[voltage]] or high-[[Electric current|current]] [[alternating current]] (AC) into [[direct current]] (DC). It is a type of [[cold cathode]] [[gas-filled tube]], but is unusual in that the cathode, instead of being solid, is made from a pool of liquid [[mercury (element)|mercury]] and is therefore self-restoring. As a result, mercury-arc valves were much more rugged and long-lasting, and could carry much higher currents than most other types of gas discharge tube.

Invented in 1902 by [[Peter Cooper Hewitt]], mercury-arc rectifiers were used to provide power for industrial motors, [[railway electrification system|electric railways]], [[Tram|streetcars]], and [[electric locomotive]]s, as well as for radio [[transmitter]]s and for [[high-voltage direct current]] (HVDC) power transmission. They were the primary method of high power rectification before the advent of [[semiconductor]] rectifiers, such as [[diode]]s, [[thyristor]]s and [[gate turn-off thyristor]]s (GTOs) in the 1970s. These solid state rectifiers have since completely replaced mercury-arc rectifiers thanks to their higher reliability, lower cost and maintenance and lower environmental risk.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=History {{!}} IEEE Power &amp; Energy Magazine|url=http://magazine.ieee-pes.org/marchapril-2014/history-12/|website=magazine.ieee-pes.org|accessdate=17 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== History ==
[[Image:Mercury arc rectifier bulb.jpg|thumb|upright=0.5|One of the first mercury arc bulbs built by Cooper Hewitt]]

In 1882 Jemin and Meneuvrier observed the rectifying properties of a mercury arc.&lt;ref&gt;https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=noV7iKthMJwC&amp;pg=PA10&amp;lpg=PA10&amp;dq=1882+Jemin+Mercury&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=TTHioZkcau&amp;sig=EmPHg8vk-9REflOqCuuM0cWuqDc&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiCmrnYnMvUAhWGOsAKHfd1AwMQ6AEIHjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=1882%20Jemin%20Mercury&amp;f=false&lt;/ref&gt; The mercury arc rectifier was invented by [[Peter Cooper Hewitt]] in 1902 and further developed throughout the 1920s and 1930s by researchers in both Europe and North America.  Before its invention, the only way to convert AC current provided by utilities to DC was by using expensive, inefficient, and high-maintenance [[rotary converter]]s or motor-generator sets.  Mercury-arc rectifiers or "converters" were used for charging storage batteries, [[Arc lamp|arc lighting]] systems,&lt;ref&gt;I.C.S. Reference Library volume 4B, [[International Textbook Company]], Scranton PA 1908, section 53, page 34.&lt;/ref&gt; the DC traction motors for [[trolleybus]]es, trams, and subways, and electroplating equipment.  The mercury rectifier was used well into the 1970s, when it was finally replaced by [[semiconductor rectifier]]s.

== Operating principles ==
[[File:Mercury Arc Rectifier.jpg|thumb|right|Glass-bulb mercury-arc rectifier from the 1940s]]

Operation of the rectifier relies on an electrical [[Electric arc|arc]] discharge between electrodes in a sealed envelope containing mercury vapor at very low pressure. A pool of liquid mercury acts as a self-renewing [[cathode]] that does not deteriorate with time. The mercury emits [[electron]]s freely, whereas the carbon [[anode]]s emit very few electrons even when heated, so the current of electrons can only pass through the tube in one direction, from cathode to anode, which allows the tube to rectify alternating current.

When an arc is formed, electrons are emitted from the surface of the pool, causing [[ionization]] of mercury vapor along the path towards the anodes. The mercury [[ion]]s are attracted towards the cathode, and the resulting ionic bombardment of the pool maintains the temperature of the ''emission spot'', so long as a current of a few amperes continues.

While the current is carried by electrons, the positive ions returning to the cathode allow the conduction path to be largely unaffected by the [[space charge]] effects which limit the performance of [[vacuum tube]]s. Consequently, the valve can carry high currents at low ''arc voltages'' (typically 20-30&amp;nbsp;V) and so is an efficient rectifier. Hot-cathode, gas discharge tubes such as the [[thyratron]] may also achieve similar levels of efficiency but heated cathode filaments are delicate and have a short operating life when used at high current.

The temperature of the envelope must be carefully controlled, since the behaviour of the arc is determined largely by the [[vapor pressure]] of the mercury, which in turn is set by the coolest spot on the enclosure wall. A typical design maintains temperature at {{convert|40|C}} and a mercury vapor pressure of 7 [[pascal (unit)|millipascal]]s.

The mercury ions emit light at characteristic wavelengths, the relative intensities of which are determined by the pressure of the vapor. At the low pressure within a rectifier, the light appears pale blue-violet and contains much [[ultraviolet]] light.

== Construction ==
The construction of a mercury arc valve takes one of two basic forms&amp;nbsp;— the glass-bulb type and the steel-tank type. Steel-tank valves were used for higher current ratings above approximately 500&amp;nbsp;A.

=== Glass-bulb valves ===
[[File:MercuryArcRectifier.svg|thumb|350px|right|A glass-envelope mercury-arc rectifier valve]]

The earliest type of mercury vapor electric rectifier consists of an evacuated glass bulb with a pool of liquid [[mercury (element)|mercury]] sitting in the bottom as the [[cathode]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Howatson A H|title=An Introduction to Gas Discharges|isbn=0-08-020575-5|publisher=[[Pergamon Press]]|location= Oxford|date= 1965|chapter=8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Over it curves the glass bulb, which condenses the mercury that is evaporated as the device operates. The glass envelope has one or more arms with [[graphite]] rods as [[anode]]s. Their number depends on the application, with one anode usually provided per phase.  The shape of the anode arms ensures that any mercury that condenses on the glass walls drains back into the main pool quickly to avoid providing a conductive path between the cathode and respective anode.  

Glass envelope rectifiers can handle hundreds of kilowatts of direct-current power in a single unit.  A six-phase rectifier rated 150 amperes has a glass envelope approximately 600&amp;nbsp;mm (24&amp;nbsp;inches) high by 300&amp;nbsp;mm (12&amp;nbsp;inches) outside diameter. These rectifiers will contain several kilograms of liquid mercury. The large size of the envelope is required due to the low thermal conductivity of glass.  Mercury vapor in the upper part of the envelope must dissipate heat through the glass envelope in order to condense and return to the cathode pool.  Some glass tubes were immersed in an oil bath to better control the temperature.

The current-carrying capacity of a glass-bulb rectifier is limited partly by the fragility of the glass envelope (the size of which increases with rated power) and partly by the size of the wires fused into the glass envelope for connection of the anodes and cathode. Development of high-current rectifiers required leadwire materials and glass with very similar coefficients of thermal expansion in order to prevent leakage of air into the envelope.  Current ratings of up to 500&amp;nbsp;A had been achieved by the mid-1930s, but most rectifiers for current ratings above this were realised using the more robust steel-tank design.

=== Steel-tank valves ===
For larger valves, a steel tank with ceramic insulators for the electrodes is used, with a vacuum pump system to counteract slight leakage of air into the tank around imperfect seals. Steel-tank valves, with water cooling for the tank, were developed with current ratings of several thousand amps.

Like glass-bulb valves, steel-tank mercury arc valves were built with only a single anode per tank (a type also known as the ''excitron'') or with multiple anodes per tank. Multiple-anode valves were usually used for multi-phase rectifier circuits (with 2, 3, 6 or 12 anodes per tank) but in HVDC applications, multiple anodes were often simply connected in parallel in order to increase the current rating.

=== Starting (ignition) ===
A conventional mercury-arc rectifier is started by a brief high-voltage arc within the rectifier, between the cathode pool and a starting electrode. By one of a number of means, the starting electrode is brought into contact with the pool and allowed to pass current through an inductive circuit. The contact with the pool is then broken, resulting in a high [[Electromotive force|emf]] and an arc discharge.

The momentary contact between the starting electrode and the pool may be achieved by a number of methods, including:
* allowing an external [[electromagnet]] to pull the [[electrode]] into contact with the pool; the electromagnet can also serve as the starting inductance,
* arranging the electromagnet to tip the bulb of a small rectifier, just enough to allow mercury from the pool to reach the starting electrode,
*  providing a narrow neck of mercury between two pools, and by passing a very high current at negligible [[voltage]] through the neck, displacing the mercury by [[magnetostriction]], thus opening the circuit,
* Passing current into the mercury pool through a bimetallic strip, which warms up under the heating action of the current and bends in such a way as to break the contact with the pool.

=== Excitation ===
Since momentary interruptions or reductions of output current may cause the cathode spot to extinguish, many rectifiers incorporate an additional electrode to maintain an arc whenever the plant is in use. Typically, a two or three phase supply of a few amperes passes through small ''excitation anodes''. A magnetically shunted transformer of a few hundred VA rating is commonly used to provide this supply.

This excitation or ''keep-alive'' circuit was absolutely necessary for single-phase rectifiers such as the excitron and for mercury-arc rectifiers used in the high-voltage supply of radiotelegraphy transmitters, as current flow was regularly interrupted every time the Morse key was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|publisher=[[American Radio Relay League]]|date=1926|title=The Radio Amateur's Handbook|edition=1st|author=Francis Edward Handy|location=Hartford, CT|pages=78–81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Grid control ===
Both glass and metal envelope rectifiers may have control grids inserted between the anode and cathode.

Installation of a control grid between the anode and the pool cathode allows control of the conduction of the valve, thereby giving control of the mean output voltage produced by the rectifier. Start of the current flow can be delayed past the point at which the arc would form in an uncontrolled valve. This allows the output voltage of a valve group to be adjusted by delaying the firing point, and allows controlled mercury-arc valves to form the active switching elements in an [[inverter (electrical)|inverter]] converting direct current into alternating current.

To maintain the valve in the non-conducting state, a negative bias of a few volts or tens of volts is applied to the grid.  As a result, electrons emitted from the cathode are repelled away from the grid, back towards the cathode, and so are prevented from reaching the anode.  With a small positive bias applied to the grid, electrons pass through the grid, towards the anode, and the process of establishing an arc discharge can commence.   However, once the arc has been established, it cannot be stopped by grid action, because the positive mercury ions produced by ionisation are attracted to the negatively charged grid and effectively neutralise it.  The only way of stopping conduction is to make the external circuit force the current to drop below a (low) critical current.

Although grid-controlled mercury-arc valves bear a superficial resemblance to [[triode]] valves, mercury-arc valves cannot be used as amplifiers except at extremely low values of current, well below the critical current needed to maintain the arc.

=== Anode grading electrodes ===
[[Image:Pole 1 mercury arc valves.jpg|thumb|right|Mercury arc valves of ASEA design, with four anode columns in parallel, in the [[HVDC Inter-Island]] scheme in [[New Zealand]].]]
Mercury-arc valves are prone to an effect called ''arc-back'' (or ''backfire''), whereby the valve conducts in the reverse direction when the voltage across it is negative.  Arc-backs can be damaging or destructive to the valve, as well as creating high short-circuit currents in the external circuit, and are more prevalent at higher voltages.  One example of the problems caused by backfire occurred in 1960 subsequent to the electrification of the Glasgow North Suburban Railway where steam services had to be re-introduced after several mishaps.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/MoT_EMUFailures1962.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;  For many years this effect limited the practical operating voltage of mercury-arc valves to a few kilovolts.

The solution was found to be to include grading electrodes between the anode and control grid, connected to an external [[resistor]]-[[capacitor]] divider circuit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Cory, B.J. |author2=Adamson, C. |author3=Ainsworth, J.D. |author4=Freris, L.L. |author5=Funke, B. |author6=Harris, L.A. |author7=Sykes, J.H.M. |title=High voltage direct current converters and systems |publisher=Macdonald &amp; Co. Ltd. |date=1965 |chapter=Chapter 2 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. [[Uno Lamm]] conducted pioneering work at [[ASEA]] in [[Sweden]] on this problem throughout the 1930s and 1940s, leading to the first truly practical mercury-arc valve for HVDC transmission, which was put into service on the 20&amp;nbsp;MW, 100&amp;nbsp;kV HVDC link from mainland Sweden to the island of [[Gotland]] in 1954.

Uno Lamm’s work on high voltage mercury-arc valves led him to be known as the "Father of HVDC" power transmission&lt;ref name=Gould92&gt;William R. Gould, "August Uno Lamm", in ''Memorial Tributes, Volume 5, 1992'', National Academy of Engineering. retrieved from http://books.nae.edu//books/0309046890/html/145.htm{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}" August 24, 2005&lt;/ref&gt; and inspired the [[IEEE]] to dedicate an award named after him, for outstanding contributions in the field of HVDC.

Mercury arc valves with grading electrodes of this type were developed up to voltage ratings of 150&amp;nbsp;kV. However, the tall porcelain column required to house the grading electrodes was more difficult to cool than the steel tank at cathode potential, so the usable current rating was limited to about 200&amp;ndash;300&amp;nbsp;A per anode. Therefore, Mercury arc valves for HVDC were often constructed with four or six anode columns in parallel. The anode columns were always air-cooled, with the cathode tanks either water-cooled or air-cooled.

== Circuits ==
Single-phase mercury-arc rectifiers were rarely used because the current dropped and the arc could be extinguished when the AC voltage changed polarity.  The direct current produced by a single-phase rectifier thus contained a varying component (ripple) at twice the power supply [[utility frequency|frequency]], which was undesirable in many applications for DC. The solution was to use [[Polyphase system|two-, three-, or even six-phase]] AC power supplies so that the rectified current would maintain a more constant voltage level. Polyphase rectifiers also balanced the load on the supply system, which is desirable for reasons of system performance and economy.

Most applications of mercury-arc valves for rectifiers used ''full-wave'' rectification with separate pairs of anodes for each phase.

In full-wave rectification both halves of the AC waveform are utilised.  The [[cathode]] is connected to the + side of the DC load, the other side being connected to the [[center tap]] of the [[transformer]] secondary winding, which always remains at zero potential with respect to ground or earth. For each AC phase, a wire from each end of that phase winding is connected to a separate [[anode]] "arm" on the mercury-arc rectifier. When the voltage at each anode becomes positive, it will begin to conduct through the mercury vapor from the cathode.  As the anodes of each AC phase are fed from opposite ends of the centre tapped transformer winding, one will always be positive with respect to the center tap and both halves of the AC Waveform will cause current to flow in one direction only through the load. This rectification of the whole AC waveform is thus called ''full-wave rectification''.

With three-phase alternating current and full-wave rectification, six anodes were used to provide a smoother direct current. Three phase operation can improve the efficiency of the transformer as well as providing smoother DC current by enabling two anodes to conduct simultaneously. During operation, the arc transfers to the anodes at the highest positive potential (with respect to the cathode).

In HVDC applications, a full-wave three-phase [[Diode bridge#Polyphase diode bridges|bridge rectifier]] or ''Graetz-bridge'' circuit was usually used, each valve accommodated in a single tank.

== Applications ==
As solid-state [[metal rectifier]]s became available for low-voltage rectification in the 1920s, mercury arc tubes became limited to higher voltage and especially high-power applications.

Mercury-arc valves were widely used until the 1960s for the conversion of alternating current into direct current for large industrial uses. Applications included power supply for streetcars, electric railways, and variable-voltage power supplies for large [[radio]] transmitters. Mercury-arc stations were used to provide DC power to legacy [[Thomas Edison|Edison]]-style [[War of Currents|DC power grids]] in urban centers until the 1950s. In the 1960s, [[solid-state (electronics)|solid-state]] silicon devices, first [[diode]]s and then [[thyristor]]s, replaced all lower-power and lower voltage rectifier applications of mercury arc tubes.

Several electric locomotives, including the [[New Haven EP5]] and the [[VGN EL-C|Virginian EL-C]], carried [[ignitron]]s on board to rectify incoming AC to traction motor DC.

[[File:Mercury Arc Valve, Radisson Converter Station, Gillam MB.jpg|thumb|right|A 150-[[kilovolt]], 1800 amp mercury-arc valve at [[Manitoba Hydro]]'s Radisson converter station, August 2003]]
One of the last major uses of mercury arc valves was in HVDC power transmission, where they were used in many projects until the early 1970s, including the [[HVDC Inter-Island]] link between the North and South Islands of [[New Zealand]] and the [[HVDC Kingsnorth]] link from [[Kingsnorth power station]] to [[London]].&lt;ref&gt;Calverley T.E., Gavrilovic, A., Last F.H., Mott C.W., The Kingsnorth-Beddington-Willesden DC Link, CIGRE session, Paris, 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; However, starting about 1975, silicon devices have made mercury-arc rectifiers largely obsolete, even in HVDC applications. The largest ever mercury-arc rectifiers, built by [[English Electric]], were rated at 150-[[Volt|kV]], 1800 A and were used until 2004 at the [[Nelson River DC Transmission System]] high-voltage DC-power-transmission project.  The valves for the Inter-Island and Kingsnorth projects used four anode columns in parallel, while those of the Nelson River project used six anode columns in parallel in order to obtain the necessary current rating.&lt;ref&gt;Cogle, T.C.J, The Nelson River Project - Manitoba Hydro exploits sub-arctic hydro power resources, Electrical Review, 23 November 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Inter-Island link was the last HVDC transmission scheme in operation using mercury arc valves. It was formally decommissioned on 1 August 2012. The mercury arc valve converter stations of the New Zealand scheme were replaced by new thyristor converter stations.  A similar mercury arc valve scheme, the [[HVDC Vancouver Island]] link was replaced by a three-phase AC link.

Mercury arc valves remain in use in some [[South Africa]]n mines, Kenya (at Mombasa Polytechnic - Electrical &amp; Electronic department), and on the [[Manx Electric Railway]] on the [[Isle of Man]] (mercury arc rectifier now decommissioned).

Mercury arc valves were used extensively in DC power systems on [[London Underground]],&lt;ref&gt;''London Transport in 1955'', p. 43, London Transport Executive, 1956 {{OCLC|867841889}}&lt;/ref&gt; and one was still observed to be in operation in 2004 at the disused [[London deep-level shelters|deep-level air-raid shelter]] at [[Belsize Park tube station|Belsize Park]].{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}  After they were no longer needed as shelters, Belsize Park and several other deep shelters were used as secure storage, particularly for music and television archives.  This led to the mercury-arc rectifier at the [[Goodge Street tube station|Goodge Street]] shelter featuring in an early episode of [[Doctor Who]] as an alien brain, cast for its "eerie glow".&lt;ref&gt;Antony Clayton, ''Subterranean City: Beneath the Streets of London'', p. 146, Historical Publications, 2000 {{ISBN|0948667699}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Others==
Special types of single-phase mercury-arc rectifiers are the [[Ignitron]] and the {{visible anchor|Excitron}}. The Excitron is similar to other types of valve described above but depends critically on the existence of an excitation anode to maintain an arc discharge during the half-cycle when the valve is not conducting current.  The Ignitron dispenses with excitation anodes by igniting the arc each time conduction is required to start.  In this way, ignitrons also avoid the need for control grids.

In 1919, the book "Cyclopedia of Telephony &amp; Telegraphy Vol. 1"&lt;ref&gt;The [[Project Gutenberg]] EBook of [http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15617/15617-h/15617-h.htm ''Cyclopedia of Telephony &amp; Telegraphy Vol. 1] ''&lt;/ref&gt; described an [[amplifier]] for [[telephone]] signals that used a magnetic field to [[modulation|modulate]] an arc in a mercury rectifier tube.  This was never commercially important.

==Environmental hazard==
Mercury compounds are toxic, highly persistent in the environment, and present a danger to humans and the environment. The use of large quantities of mercury in fragile glass envelopes presents a hazard of potential release of mercury to the environment should the glass bulb be broken. Some HVDC converter stations have required extensive clean-up to eliminate traces of mercury emitted from the station over its service life.  Steel tank rectifiers frequently required vacuum pumps, which continually emitted small amounts of mercury vapor.

==In popular culture==
In some Frankenstein movies mercury arc rectifiers are shown [https://moviesoothsayer.wordpress.com/2012/06/26/movie-madness-16-evil-of-frankenstein/].

[[File:Petrolkoks IMG 6166.jpg|thumb|250px|Petroleum coke]]
'''Petroleum coke''', abbreviated '''coke''' or '''petcoke''', is a final [[carbon]]-rich solid material that derives from [[oil refinery|oil refining]], and is one type of the group of fuels referred to as [[Coke (fuel)|coke]]s. Petcoke is the coke that, in particular, derives from a final [[cracking (chemistry)|cracking]] process—a thermo-based chemical engineering process that splits long chain hydrocarbons of petroleum into shorter chains—that takes place in units termed  [[coker unit]]s.&lt;ref name = P04522 /&gt; (Other types of [[Coke (fuel)|coke]] are derived from [[coal]].) Stated succinctly, coke is the "carbonization product of high-boiling hydrocarbon fractions obtained in petroleum processing (heavy residues)."&lt;ref&gt;http://goldbook.iupac.org/P04522.html&lt;/ref&gt; Petcoke is also produced in the production of [[synthetic crude]] oil (syncrude) from [[bitumen]] extracted from Canada’s [[oil sand]]s and from Venezuela's [[Orinoco oil sands]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.thoughtco.com/what-is-petcoke-1203827| title=What Is Petcoke?| accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=petc/&gt;

In petroleum coker units, residual [[oil]]s from other [[distillation]] processes used in [[petroleum refining]] are treated at a high temperature and pressure leaving the petcoke after driving off gases and volatiles, and separating off remaining light and heavy oils. These processes are termed "coking processes", and most typically employ [[chemical engineering]] plant operations for the specific process of [[delayed coking]]. 

[[Image:Delayed Coker.png|thumb|right|250px|A delayed coking unit.A schematic flow diagram of such a unit, where ''residual oil'' enters the process at the lower left (see →), proceeds via pumps to the ''main fractionator'' (tall column at right), the residue of which, shown in green, is pumped via a furnace into the ''coke drums'' (two columns left and center) where the final carbonization takes place, at high temperature and pressure, in the presence of steam.]]

This coke can either be fuel grade (high in [[sulfur]] and metals) or anode grade (low in sulfur and metals). The raw coke directly out of the coker is often referred to as [[green coke]].&lt;ref name = P04522 &gt;[http://goldbook.iupac.org/P04522.html Petroleum coke] on the website of the [[IUPAC]] Compendium of Chemical Terminology&lt;/ref&gt; In this context, "green" means unprocessed. The further processing of green coke by [[Calcination|calcining]] in a [[rotary kiln]] removes residual volatile hydrocarbons from the coke. The [[calcined petroleum coke]] can be further processed in an anode baking oven to produce anode coke of the desired shape and physical properties. The anodes are mainly used in the [[aluminium]] and [[steel]] industry.

Petcoke is over 90% carbon and emits 5% to 10% more [[carbon dioxide]] (CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) than coal on a per-unit-of-energy basis when it is burned. As petcoke has a higher energy content, petcoke emits between 30 and 80 percent more CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; than coal per unit of weight.&lt;ref name=petc&gt;[http://priceofoil.org/wp-content/uploads/2013/01/OCI.Petcoke.FINALSCREEN.pdf "Petroleum Coke: The Coal Hiding in the Tar Sands"], ''OilChange International'' priceofoil.org January, 2013.&lt;/ref&gt; The difference between coal and coke in CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; production per unit of energy produced depends upon the moisture in the coal, which increases the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per unit of energy – [[heat of combustion]]) and on the volatile hydrocarbons in coal and coke, which decrease the CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; per unit of energy.

==Types of petroleum coke==
There are at least four basic types of petroleum coke, namely, needle coke, honeycomb coke, sponge coke and shot coke. Different types of petroleum coke have different microstructures due to differences in operating variables and nature of feedstock. Significant differences are also to be observed in the properties of the different types of coke, particularly ash and volatile matter contents.&lt;ref name=Hassan1990&gt;Hassan Al-Haj Ibrahim, Desulfurization of petroleum coke, Research report, University of Pittsburgh, Pittsburgh, 1990.&lt;/ref&gt;

Needle coke, also called acicular coke, is a highly [[crystalline]] petroleum coke used in the production of electrodes for the [[steel]] and [[aluminium]] industries and is particularly valuable because the electrodes must be replaced regularly. Needle coke is produced exclusively from either [[Fluid catalytic cracking|FCC]] decant oil or coal tar pitch. 

Honeycomb coke is an intermediate coke, with ellipsoidal pores that are uniformly distributed. Compared to needle coke, honeycomb coke has a lower coefficient of thermal expansion and a lower electrical conductivity.&lt;ref name=Hassan1990 /&gt;

==Fuel-grade coke==
Fuel-grade coke is classified as either sponge coke or shot coke morphology. While oil refiners have been producing coke for over 100 years, the mechanisms that cause sponge coke or shot coke to form are not well understood and cannot be accurately predicted. In general, lower temperatures and higher pressures promote sponge coke formation. Additionally, the amount of [[heptane]] insolubles present and the fraction of light components in the coker feed contribute.

While its high heat and low [[Fly ash|ash]] content make it a decent fuel for power generation in coal-fired [[boiler]]s, petroleum coke is high in [[sulfur]] and low in [[Volatile organic compound|volatile]] content, and this poses environmental (and technical) problems with its combustion. Its [[heat of combustion|gross calorific value]] (HHV) is nearly 8000 Kcal/kg which is twice the value of average coal used in electricity generation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Pet Coke |url=http://www.essar.com/article.aspx?cont_id=UhfGZmBNAZc= |accessdate=25 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;. A common choice of sulfur recovering unit for burning petroleum coke is the [[SNOX process|SNOX Flue gas desulfurisation]] technology,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.energystorm.us/Snox_Process_A_Success_Story-r149018.html "SNOX Process: A Success Story"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090721122110/http://www.energystorm.us/Snox_Process_A_Success_Story-r149018.html |date=2009-07-21 }}, ''energystorm.us''. Cited therein: "Schoolbook, Chemistry 2000, Helge Mygind, {{ISBN|87-559-0992-2}}".&lt;/ref&gt; which is based on the well-known [[WSA Process]]. [[Fluidized bed combustion]] is commonly used to burn petroleum coke. [[Gasification]] is increasingly used with this feedstock (often using gasifiers placed in the refineries themselves).

==Calcined petroleum coke==
Calcined petroleum coke (CPC) is the product from [[Calcination|calcining]] petroleum coke.  This coke is the product of the [[coker unit]] in a crude [[oil refinery]]. The calcined petroleum coke is used to make [[anode]]s for the [[aluminium]], [[steel]] and [[titanium]] smelting industry.  The [[green coke]] must have sufficiently low metal content to be used as anode material.  Green coke with this low metal content is called anode-grade coke. When green coke has excessive metal content, it is not calcined and is used as [[Coke (fuel)|fuel-grade coke]] in furnaces.

==Desulfurization of petcoke==
A high [[sulfur]] content in petcoke reduces its market value, and may preclude its use as fuel due to restrictions on [[sulfur oxides]] emissions for environmental reasons. Methods have thus been proposed to reduce or eliminate the sulfur content of petcoke. Most of them involve the [[desorption]] of the inorganic sulfur present in the pores or surface of the coke, and the partition and removal of the organic sulfur attached to the aromatic carbon skeleton.

Potential petroleum [[desulfurization]] techniques can be classified as follows:&lt;ref&gt;''Desulfurization of Petroleum Coke: A Review,'' Hassan Al-Haj-Ibrahim and Badie I. Morsi, Industrial and Engineering Chemistry Research, 1992, 31, 1835–1840.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Solvent]] extraction
# Chemical treatment
# Thermal desulfurization
# Desulfurization in an oxidizing atmosphere
# Desulfurization in an atmosphere of sulfur-bearing gas
# Desulfurization in an atmosphere of hydrocarbon gases
# Hydrodesulfurization

As of 2011 there was no commercial process available to desulfurize petcoke.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Agarwal|first1=P.|last2=Sharma|first2=D.K.|title=Studies on the Desulfurization of Petroleum Coke by Organorefining and Other Chemical and Biochemical Techniques Under Milder Ambient Pressure Conditions|journal=Petroleum Science and Technology|date=2011|volume=29|issue=14|pages=1482–1493|doi=10.1080/10916460902839230}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Storage, disposal, and sale==
Nearly pure carbon, petcoke is a potent source of [[carbon dioxide]] if burned.&lt;ref name=OCIJanuary2013&gt;{{cite web|title=Petroleum Coke: The Coal Hiding in the Tar Sands|url=http://priceofoil.org/2013/01/17/petroleum-coke-the-coal-hiding-in-the-tar-sands/|publisher=Oil Change International|accessdate=May 18, 2013|first=Lorne |last=Stockman|date=January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petroleum coke may be stored in a pile near an oil refinery pending sale. For example, in 2013 a large stockpile owned by [[Koch Industries|Koch Carbon]] near the [[Detroit River]] was produced by a [[Marathon Petroleum]] refinery in [[Detroit, Michigan|Detroit]] which had begun refining [[bitumen]] from the [[oil sands]] of [[Alberta]] in November 2012. Large stockpiles of petcoke also existed in Canada as of 2013, and China and Mexico were markets for petcoke exported from California to be used as fuel.  As of 2013 Oxbow Corporation, owned by [[Bill Koch (businessman)|William I. Koch]], was a major dealer in petcoke, selling 11 million tons annually.&lt;ref name=NYT51713&gt;{{cite news|title=A Black Mound of Canadian Oil Waste Is Rising Over Detroit|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/05/18/business/energy-environment/mountain-of-petroleum-coke-from-oil-sands-rises-in-detroit.html|accessdate=May 18, 2013|newspaper=The New York Times|date=May 17, 2013|first=Ian |last=Austin}}.  &lt;/ref&gt;

In 2017 a quarter of US exports of the fuel went to India, an [[Associated Press]] investigation found.  In 2016 this amounted to more than eight million metric tons, more than 20 times as much as in 2010.&lt;ref name=AP&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Bay Area News Group |author1=Tammy Webber | author2=Katy Daigle | agency=Associated Press |page=A4 |work=San Jose Mercury-News | title=US exporting dirty fuel to pollution-choked India| year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; India's Environmental Pollution Control Authority tested imported petcoke in use near [[New Delhi]], and found [[sulfur]] levels 17 times the legal limit.&lt;ref name=AP/&gt;

The International Convention for Prevention of Pollution from Ships ([[MARPOL 73/78]]), adopted by the [[International Maritime Organization|IMO]], has mandated that marine vessels shall not consume residual fuel oils ([[bunker fuel]], etc) with a sulfur content greater than 0.1% from the year 2020.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=http://www.usaee.org/usaee2014/submissions/OnlineProceedings/Implications%20of%20RFO%20Phase%20Out-Ramberg&amp;VanVactor.pdf| title=Implications of Residual Fuel Oil Phase Out| accessdate=17 March 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly 38% of residual fuel oils are consumed in the shipping sector. In the process of converting excess residual oils into lighter oils by coking processes, pet coke is generated as a byproduct. Pet coke availability is expected to increase in the future due to falling demand for residual oil. Pet coke is also used in [[methanation]] plants to produce [[synthetic natural gas]], etc. in order to avoid a pet coke disposal problem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title= Reliance Jamnagar pet coke gasification project |url=http://gasification2016.missionenergy.org/presentation/ril.pdf |accessdate=15 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Health hazards==
Petroleum coke is sometimes a source of [[particulates|fine dust]], which can penetrate the filtering process of the human airway, lodge in the lungs and cause serious health problems. Studies have shown that petroleum coke itself has a low level of [[toxicity]] and there is no evidence of [[carcinogen]]icity.&lt;ref name="epa"&gt;https://www.epa.gov/petroleum-coke-chicago/health-effects-petroleum-coke&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title = U.S. world’s biggest supplier of heavy oil refining byproduct | url = https://www.staradvertiser.com/2017/12/01/breaking-news/u-s-worlds-biggest-supplier-of-heavy-oil-refining-byproduct/ | newspaper = [[Star-Advertiser]] | location = [[Honolulu]] | agency = [[Associated Press]] | date = December 1, 2017 | access-date = December 1, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Petroleum coke can contain [[vanadium]], a toxic metal. Vanadium was found in the dust collected in occupied dwellings near the petroleum coke stored next to the Detroit River. Vanadium is toxic in tiny quantities, 0.8 micrograms per cubic meter of air, according to the [[Environmental Protection Agency|EPA]].&lt;ref&gt;''Detroit Free Press,'' "HEALTH CONCERNS GO BEYOND FLINT WATER " by  Keith Matheny; Sunday March 27, 2016; page A1&lt;/ref&gt;

According to multiple EPA studies and analyses, petroleum coke has a low health hazard potential in humans. It does not have any observable carcinogenic, developmental, or reproductive effects. During animal case studies repeated-dose chronic inhalation did show respiratory [[inflammation]] due to dust particles, but not specific to petroleum coke.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Andrews|first=Anthony|year=2013|title=Petroleum Coke: Industry and Environmental Issues|url=http://www.nam.org/CRSreport/|journal=Congressional Research Service|volume=|pages=9|via=nam.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Phoenix-Fabelwesen.jpg|thumb|right|A phoenix depicted in a book of legendary creatures by [[Friedrich Justin Bertuch|FJ Bertuch]] (1747–1822)]]
In [[Greek mythology]], a '''phoenix''' ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|f|iː|n|ᵻ|k|s}}; {{lang-grc|φοῖνιξ}}, ''phoînix'') is a long-lived [[bird]] that cyclically regenerates or is otherwise born again. 

Associated with the Sun, a phoenix obtains new life by arising from the [[ash]]es of its predecessor. According to some sources, the phoenix dies in a show of flames and combustion, although there are other sources that claim that the legendary bird dies and simply decomposes before being born again.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA146 146]}} There are different traditions concerning the lifespan of the phoenix, but by most accounts the phoenix lived for  500 years before rebirth.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA67 67&amp;ndash;70]}} [[Herodotus]], [[Lucan]], [[Pliny the Elder]], [[Pope Clement I]], [[Lactantius]], [[Ovid]], and [[Isidore of Seville]] are among those who have contributed to the retelling and transmission of the phoenix motif.

In the historical record, the phoenix "could symbolize renewal in general as well as the sun, time, [[Roman Empire|the Empire]], [[metempsychosis]], [[consecration]], [[resurrection]], life in the heavenly [[Paradise]], [[Christ (title)|Christ]], [[Mary (mother of Jesus)|Mary]], [[virginity]], the exceptional man, and certain aspects of Christian life".{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = [https://books.google.com/books?id=jwIVAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA9 9]}}

==Etymology==
The modern English noun ''phoenix'' derives from [[Middle English]] ''phenix'' (before 1150), itself from [[Old English]] ''fēnix'' (around 750). Old English ''fēnix'' was borrowed from Medieval Latin ''phenix'', which is derived from Classical Latin ''phoenīx''. The Classical Latin ''phoenīx'' represents Greek φοῖνιξ ''phoinīx''.{{Sfn | Barnhart | 1995 | p = 564}}

In ancient Greece and Rome, the bird, phoenix, was sometimes associated with the similar-sounding [[Phoenicia]], a civilization famous for its production of purple dye from conch shells. A late antique etymology offered by the 6th- and 7th-century CE archbishop [[Isidore of Seville]] accordingly derives the name of the phoenix from its allegedly purple-red hue. Because the costly purple dye from Phoenicia was associated with the upper classes in antiquity and, later, with royalty, in the medieval period the phoenix was considered "the royal bird".{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 51}}

In spite of these [[folk etymology|folk etymologies]], with the deciphering of the [[Linear B]] script in the 20th century, the original Greek φοῖνιξ was decisively shown to be derived from [[Mycenaean Greek]] ''po-ni-ke'', itself open to a variety of interpretations.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 62–66}}

==Relation to the Egyptian Bennu==
Classical discourse on the subject of the phoenix points to a potential origin of the phoenix in [[Ancient Egypt]]. In the 19th century scholastic suspicions appeared to be confirmed by the discovery that Egyptians in [[Heliopolis (Ancient Egypt)|Heliopolis]] had venerated the [[Bennu]], a solar bird observed in some respects to be similar to the Greek phoenix.  However, the Egyptian sources regarding the bennu are often problematic and open to a variety of interpretations. Some of these sources may have actually been influenced by Greek notions of the phoenix, rather than the other way around.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 14–25}}

[[Herodotus]], writing in the 5th century BC, gives a somewhat skeptical account of the phoenix:

{{quote|[The Egyptians] have also another sacred bird called the phoenix which I myself have never seen, except in pictures. Indeed it is a great rarity, even in Egypt, only coming there (according to the accounts of the people of Heliopolis) once in five hundred years, when the old phoenix dies. Its size and appearance, if it is like the pictures, are as follow:– The plumage is partly red, partly golden, while the general make and size are almost exactly that of the eagle. They tell a story of what this bird does, which does not seem to me to be credible: that he comes all the way from Arabia, and brings the parent bird, all plastered over with myrrh, to the temple of the Sun, and there buries the body. In order to bring him, they say, he first forms a ball of myrrh as big as he finds that he can carry; then he hollows out the ball, and puts his parent inside, after which he covers over the opening with fresh myrrh, and the ball is then of exactly the same weight as at first; so he brings it to Egypt, plastered over as I have said, and deposits it in the temple of the Sun. Such is the story they tell of the doings of this bird.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, ''[[Histories (Herodotus)|The Histories]]'', [http://classics.mit.edu/Herodotus/history.2.ii.html Book II] Trans. G. Rawlinson (1858)&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Appearance==
[[File:Phoenix_detail_from_Aberdeen_Bestiary.jpg|thumb|right|Detail from the 12th-century ''[[Aberdeen Bestiary]]'', featuring a phoenix]]
The phoenix is sometimes pictured in ancient and medieval literature and medieval art as endowed with a [[Halo (optical phenomenon)|nimbus]], which emphasizes the bird's connection with the Sun.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 233}} In the oldest images of phoenixes on record these nimbuses often have seven rays, like [[Helios]] (the sun Titan of Greek mythology).{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = 246–247}} Pliny the Elder&lt;ref&gt;''Ancient Magic and the Supernatural in the Modern Visual and Performing Arts'', edited by Filippo CarlÁ,Irene Berti, page172&lt;/ref&gt; also describes the bird as having a crest of feathers on its head,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 233}} and [[Ezekiel the Tragedian|Ezekiel the Dramatist]] compared it to a rooster.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 257}}

Although the phoenix was generally believed to be colorful and vibrant, sources provide no clear consensus about its coloration. [[Tacitus]] says that its color made it stand out from all other birds.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 253}} Some said that the bird had peacock-like coloring, and [[Herodotus]]'s claim of the Phoenix being red and yellow is popular in many versions of the story on record.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 259}} Ezekiel the Dramatist declared that the phoenix had red legs and striking yellow eyes,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 257}} but [[Lactantius]] said that its eyes were blue like sapphires{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 256}} and that its legs were covered in yellow-gold scales with rose-colored talons.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | pp = 257–258}}

Herodotus, Pliny, [[Solinus]], and [[Philostratus]] describe the phoenix as similar in size to an eagle,{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 251}} but Lactantius and Ezekiel the Dramatist both claim that the phoenix was larger, with Lactantius declaring that it was even larger than an ostrich.{{Sfn | Van der Broek | 1972 | p = 252}}

==In later European culture==
[[Dante]] refers to the phoenix in ''[[Inferno (Dante)|Inferno]]'' Canto XXIV:
{{Verse translation|lang=it|
&lt;poem&gt;Così per li gran savi si confessa
che la fenice more e poi rinasce,
quando al cinquecentesimo anno appressa;

&lt;poem&gt;Even thus by the great sages 'tis confessed

In the play ''[[Henry VIII (play)|Henry VIII]]'' by [[William Shakespeare]] and [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]], the King says in [[s:The Life of King Henry the Eighth|Act V Scene v]], in flattering reference to his young daughter Elizabeth (who was to become [[Elizabeth I of England|Queen Elizabeth I]]):

{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;Nor shall this peace sleep with her; but as when
The bird of wonder dies, the maiden phoenix,
Her ashes new create another heir
As great in admiration as herself;
So shall she leave her blessedness to one,
When heaven shall call her from this cloud of darkness,
Who from the sacred ashes of her honour
Shall star-like rise as great in fame as she was,
And so stand fix'd.&lt;/poem&gt;}}

[[File:Woodworking-joint-rebate.gif|thumb|300px|right|A rabbet]]
A '''rabbet''' or '''rebate''' is a recess or groove cut into the edge of a piece of machinable material, usually [[wood]]. When viewed in cross-section, a rabbet is two-sided and open to the edge or end of the surface into which it is cut.

An example of the use of a rabbet is in a glazing bar where it makes provision for the insertion of the pane of glass and putty. It may also accommodate the edge of the back panel of a cabinet. It is also used in door and [[casement window]] [[jamb]]s, and for [[shiplap]] planking. A rabbet can be used to form a joint with another piece of wood (often containing a [[dado (joinery)|dado]]).

== Etymology ==
The word ''rabbet'' is from [[Old French]] ''rabbat'', "a recess into a wall",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite encyclopedia |last=Harper |first=Douglas |editor-link= |encyclopedia=Online Etymology Dictionary |title=rabbet, ''n'' |url=http://www.etymonline.com/index.php?term=rabbet |access-date=1 July 2018 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''rabattre'' "to beat down".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite OED|rabbet}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the Oxford English Dictionary, "In North America the more usual form is ''rabbet''".&lt;ref name="OED rebate n2"/&gt; The form "rebate" is often pronounced the same way as "rabbet".&lt;ref name="OED rebate n2"&gt;{{cite OED|rebate, n.2|id=159164}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==

[[File:Gaseous tritium light source.jpg|thumb|right|300px|Radioluminescent {{convert|1.8|Ci|GBq|lk=on|adj=on}} {{convert|6|×|0.2|in|mm|adj=on}} tritium vial used as a light source.  It consists of a sealed glass tube containing radioactive tritium gas whose inner surfaces are coated with a [[phosphor]].]]

'''Radioluminescence''' is the phenomenon by which [[luminescence|light is produced in a material]] by bombardment with [[ionizing radiation]] such as [[alpha particle]]s, [[beta particle]]s, or [[gamma ray]]s.  Radioluminescence is used as a low level light source for night illumination of instruments or signage or other applications where light must be produced for long periods without external energy sources.  Radioluminescent paint used to be used for clock hands and instrument dials, enabling them to be read in the dark.  Radioluminescence is also sometimes seen around high-power radiation sources, such as [[nuclear reactor]]s and [[Radionuclide|radioisotopes]].

==Mechanism==
Radioluminescence occurs when an incoming particle of [[ionizing radiation]]  collides with an atom or molecule, exciting an orbital electron to a higher energy level.  The particle usually comes from the [[radioactive decay]] of an atom of a [[Radionuclide|radioisotope]], an [[isotope]] of an element which is radioactive.  The electron then returns to its ground energy level by emitting the extra energy as a [[photon]] of light.  A chemical that releases light of a particular color when struck by ionizing radiation is called a [[phosphor]].  Radioluminescent light sources usually consist of a radioactive substance mixed with, or in proximity to, a phosphor.

==Applications==
{{see also|Luminous paint#Radioluminescent paint}}
Since radioactivity was discovered around the turn of the 20th century, the main application of radioluminescence has been in [[radioluminescent paint]], used on [[watch]] and [[compass]] dials, [[gunsight]]s, [[flight instruments|aircraft flight instrument]] faces, and other instruments, to allow them to be seen in the dark.  Radioluminescent paint consists of a mixture of a chemical containing a [[radioisotope]] with a radioluminescent chemical ([[phosphor]]).  The continuous [[radioactive decay]] of the isotope's atoms releases radiation particles which strike the molecules of the phosphor, causing them to give off light.  The constant bombardment by radioactive particles causes the chemical breakdown of many types of phosphor, so radioluminescent paints lose some of their luminosity over their working life.

===Tritium===
{{main article|Tritium radioluminescence}}
[[File:Tritium-watch.jpg|thumb|Watch face illuminated by tritium tubes]]

The latest generation of radioluminescent materials is based on [[tritium]], a radioactive isotope of [[hydrogen]] with half-life of 12.32 years that emits very low-energy beta radiation.  It is used on [[wristwatch]] faces, [[Sight (device)|gun sights]], and emergency [[exit signs]].  The tritium gas is contained in a small glass tube, coated with a [[phosphor]] on the inside.  [[Beta particles]] emitted by the tritium strike the phosphor coating and cause it to [[fluoresce]], emitting light, usually yellow-green.

Tritium is used because it is believed to pose a negligible threat to human health, in contrast to the previous radioluminescent source, radium ''(below)'', which proved to be a significant radiological hazard. The low-energy 5.7&amp;nbsp;keV beta particles emitted by tritium cannot pass through the enclosing glass tube.  Even if they could, they are not able to penetrate human skin. Tritium is only a health threat if ingested. Since tritium is a gas, if a tritium tube breaks, the gas dissipates in the air and is diluted to safe concentrations.
Tritium has a half-life of 12.3 years, so the brightness of a tritium light source will decline to half its initial value in that time.

===Promethium===
In the second half of the 20th century, radium was progressively replaced with paint containing [[promethium]]-147.  Promethium is a low-energy [[beta particle|beta-emitter]], which, unlike [[alpha particle|alpha emitters]] like radium does not degrade the phosphor lattice, so the luminosity of the material will not degrade so quickly.   It also does not emit the penetrating [[gamma ray]]s which radium does.  The half-life of &lt;sup&gt;147&lt;/sup&gt;Pm is only 2.62 years, so in a decade the radioactivity of a promethium dial will decline to only 1/16 of its original value, making it safer to dispose of, compared to radium with its half life of 1600 years.  However, this short half-life meant that the luminosity of promethium dials also dropped by half every 2.62 years, giving them a short useful life, which led to promethium's replacement by tritium (above).

Promethium-based paint was used to illuminate [[Apollo Lunar Module]] electrical switch tips and painted on control panels of the [[Lunar Roving Vehicle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Apollo Experience Report – Protection Against Radiation|url=http://www.hq.nasa.gov/alsj/tnD7080RadProtect.pdf|publisher=NASA|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Radium===
{{main article|Radium dials}}
{{see also|Radium Girls}}
[[File:Radium Dial.jpg|thumb|A 1950s radium clock, exposed to [[black light|ultraviolet light]] to increase luminescence]]
[[File:Radium-paint.jpg|thumb|Self-luminous white radium paint on the face and hand of an old clock.]]

The first use of radioluminescence was in luminous paint containing [[radium]], a natural [[radioisotope]].  Beginning in 1908, luminous paint containing a mixture of [[radium]] and [[copper]]-[[doped]] [[zinc sulfide]] was used to paint watch faces and instrument dials, giving a greenish glow. Phosphors containing [[copper]]-doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Cu) yield blue-green light; copper and [[manganese]]-doped zinc sulfide (ZnS:Cu,Mn), yielding yellow-orange light, are also used. Radium-based luminescent paint is no longer used due to the radiation hazard posed to those manufacturing the dials. These phosphors are not suitable for use in layers thicker than 25&amp;nbsp;mg/cm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;, as the self-absorption of the light then becomes a problem. Furthermore, zinc sulfide undergoes degradation of its crystal lattice structure, leading to gradual loss of brightness significantly faster than the depletion of radium.

ZnS:Ag coated [[spinthariscope]] screens were used by [[Ernest Rutherford]] in his experiments discovering the [[atomic nucleus]].

Radium was used in luminous paint until the 1960s, when it was replaced with the other radioisotopes above due to health concerns.&lt;ref name="Tykva"&gt;{{cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to [[alpha ray|alpha]] and [[beta ray]]s, radium emits penetrating [[gamma ray]]s, which can pass through the metal and glass of a watch dial, and skin.  A typical older radium wristwatch dial has a radioactivity of 3–10 [[Becquerel|kBq]] and could expose its wearer to an annual dose of 24 [[Sievert|millisieverts]] if worn continuously.&lt;ref name="Tykva" /&gt;  Another health hazard is its decay product, the radioactive gas [[radon]], which constitutes a significant risk even at extremely low concentrations when breathed.  Radium's long [[half-life]] of 1600 years means that surfaces coated with radium paint, such as watch faces and hands, remain a health hazard long after their useful life is over.  There are still millions of luminous radium clock, watch, and compass faces and aircraft instrument dials owned by the public.  The case of the "[[Radium Girls]]", workers in watch factories in the early 1920s who painted watch faces with radium paint and later contracted fatal cancer through ingesting radium when they pointed their brushes with their lips, increased public awareness of the hazards of radioluminescent materials, and [[Radioactive decay|radioactivity]] in general.

'''Retread''', also known as "recap", or a "remold" is a [[re-manufacturing]] process for [[tires]] that replace the [[tread]] on worn tires. Retreading is applied to casings of spent tires that have been inspected and repaired.&lt;ref name=Flapper&gt;{{cite book|last=(eds.)|first=Simme Douwe P. Flapper, Jo A.E.E. van Nunen, Luk N. van Wassenhove,|title=Managing closed-loop supply chains|year=2005|publisher=Springer|location=Berlin|isbn=3540272518|pages=119|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XspQ0PUNjvkC&amp;pg=PA119}}&lt;/ref&gt; It preserves about 90% of the material in spent tires and the material cost is about 20% compared to manufacturing a new one.

==Applications==
===United States===
Some applications for retreaded tires are airplanes, racing cars, buses and delivery trucks. Use of retreaded tires was common historically, but as of 2008, it was seldom used for passenger vehicles, mainly due to discomfort on the road, safety issues and cheaper tire brands surfacing on the market. About 17.6 million retreaded tires were sold in North America in 2006.&lt;ref name=Bodziak&gt;{{cite book|last=Bodziak|first=William|title=Tire Tread and Tire Track Evidence: Recovery and Forensic Examination Practical Aspects of Criminal &amp; Forensic Investigations|year=2008|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=1420006827|pages=90|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yRsHlttaMrMC&amp;pg=PA90}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Process==
There are two main processes used for retreading tires, called Mold Cure and Pre Cure. Both processes start with the inspection of the tire, followed by non-destructive inspection method such as [[shearography]] to locate non-visible damage and embedded [[road debris|debris]] and nails. Some casings are repaired and some are discarded. Tires can be retreaded multiple times if the casing is in usable condition. Tires used for short delivery vehicles are retreaded more than long haul tires over the life of the tire body. Casings fit for retreading have the old tread buffed away to prepare for retreading.&lt;ref name="Bodziak"/&gt;

Material cost for a retreaded tire is about 20% that of making a new tire.&lt;ref name="Flapper"/&gt;
About 90% of the original tires by weight is retained in retreaded tires. A 1997 study estimates that then current generation of commercial vehicles tires to last up to 600,000 miles if they're retreaded two to three times. &lt;ref name=Madu&gt;{{cite book|last=Madu|first=ed. by Christian N.|title=Handbook of environmentally conscious manufacturing|year=2001|publisher=Kluwer Academic Publishers|location=Boston, Mass. [u.a.]|isbn=0792384490|page=89|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=e-R5VOiv1YwC&amp;pg=PA89}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pre cure===
Previously prepared tread strip is applied to [[tire casing]] with [[cement]]. This method allows more flexibility in tire sizes and it is the most commonly used method, but results in a seam where the ends of the strip meet.&lt;ref name="Bodziak"/&gt;

===Mold cure===
Raw rubber is applied to the tire casing and it is then placed in a mold where tread is formed. A dedicated mold is required for each tire size and tread design. 

====Bead to Bead molding====
In this subtype, retreading is also applied to the side walls. These tires are given entirely new branding and stamps. &lt;ref name="Bodziak"/&gt;

==Regulations==
Some jurisdictions have regulations concerning tire retreading.

===Europe===
In Europe all retreads, by law, must be manufactured according to EC Regulation 108 (car tires) or 109 (commercial vehicle tires). As part of this regulation all tires must be tested according to the same load and speed criteria as those undergone by new tires.

The [[Land Fill Directive]] of 1999 banned tires in landfills in 2003, and banned shredded tires in 2006.&lt;ref name="Flapper"/&gt;

===United States===
The [[Department of Transportation]] requires marking of a "DOTR number" which shows the name of the retreader and when it was retreaded. &lt;ref name="Bodziak"/&gt;

==Safety==
The United States [[National Highway Traffic Safety Administration]] recognizes the public perception that retread tires frequently used by heavy vehicles are less safe than new tires as evidenced by [[tire debris]] frequently found on highways.  The NHTSA is continuing research to determine the proportion of tire debris from retreads in comparison to new tires. Additionally, the NHTSA is researching the cause of tire failure and the crash safety problem posed by tire failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nhtsa.gov/Research/Crash+Avoidance/Heavy+Vehicle+Research+-+Tires |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-10-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131019124610/http://www.nhtsa.gov/Research/Crash+Avoidance/Heavy+Vehicle+Research+-+Tires |archivedate=2013-10-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Federal Executive Order 13149 supports the use of retread tires for economic and environmental efficiency by requiring federal vehicles to use retread tires after original factory equipped tires become non serviceable, but only when "such products are reasonably available and meet applicable performance standards".

==Environmental Impact==
Retread tires in service lower the volume of raw materials required for the manufacturing of a new tire. This includes a pronounced reduction in the use of oil. In fact, the US EPA estimated a greater than 70% savings in oil used for a retread as compared to a new tire. This also means significant reductions in greenhouse gas emissions.

In addition to reducing the amount of raw materials extracted, retread tires also minimize the amount of waste that ends up in landfills. The latest figures by the US EPA indicate that over 11.2 M waste tires were dumped into the U.S. municipal solid waste stream. To understand this figure, it is equivalent to lining up passenger tires tread to tread from roughly Los Angeles to San Diego or Philadelphia to Washington DC. Because a retread tire prevents the need for manufacturing a new tire, significant environmental benefits are achieved. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.bandag.com/en-us/research-center/financial-environmental-benefits&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:RECON instrument package.JPG|thumb|Instrument package (LOBO, Satlantic, Inc., Halifax) treated with e-paint, copper foil and copper cladding to prevent colonization by barnacles and other sessile animals.]]

The '''River, Estuary, and Coastal Observing Network''' ('''RECON''') is a pioneering waterway observing system founded and maintained by Sanibel-Captiva Conservation.

RECON is funded primarily by private donations to SCCF's Marine Laboratory. Seven fixed locations stream water quality data from in situ [http://www.satlantic.com Satlantic] instrument packages. The sensor array includes a [[chemical-free]] [[nitrate]] sensor (ISUS), a CTD (conductivity, temperature, and depth) and [[fluorometer]] package for depth, turbidity, temperature, dissolved oxygen, salinity, and [[Chlorophyll|chlorophyll a]] fitted with a bleach injection system (WETLabs, Water Quality Monitor), and a CDOM fluorometer.&lt;ref&gt;[http://recon.sccf.org/about/sensor_details.shtml RECON sensor package details]&lt;/ref&gt; One of the stations also incorporates a Nortek Aquadopp 2-dimensional current profiler sampling at 1&amp;nbsp;MHz for flow measurements. Data are currently collected hourly and transmitted in near-real time via cellular modems to a dedicated [[SQL]] database and can be viewed also in near real-time and plotted at [http://recon.sccf.org RECON's website].

Extensive field testing by SCCF has led also to several innovative modifications to improve duration and robustness of these instruments.&lt;ref&gt;[http://recon.sccf.org/about/fouling.shtml RECON anti-fouling modifications]&lt;/ref&gt; These include a non-toxic exterior anti-fouling paint, copper foil applied to all connectors and cables, and a custom designed support structure to attach to existing pilings. Other enhancements include a user-friendly website designed for scientists, decision-makers and the general public. Information disseminated through the website includes concise definitions of water quality parameters measured and how to interpret trends in water quality at high resolution. To maintain data quality control, water samples are collected to validate instrument settings and readings with traditional wet-chemistry methods. Water samples are analyzed by a state-certified [[Florida Department of Environmental Protection]] laboratory in Tallahassee, FL. SCCF plans to maintain the observing systems for the next three years or more, depending on funding.

'''Single-phase generator''' (also known as '''single-phase alternator''') is an [[alternating current]] [[electrical generator]] that produces a single, continuously alternating voltage. Single-phase generators can be used to generate power in [[single-phase electric power]] systems. However, [[Polyphase coil|polyphase generators]] are generally used to deliver power in [[Three-phase electric power|three-phase distribution]] system and the current is converted to single-phase near the single-phase loads instead. Therefore, single-phase generators are found in applications that are most often used when the loads being driven are relatively light,&lt;ref name="navy"&gt;{{cite web|title=Module 5—Introduction to Generators and Motors (NAVEDTRA 14177)|url=http://www.maritime.org/doc/neets/mod05.pdf|work=Navy Electricity and Electronics Training Series|publisher=United States Navy|accessdate=4 September 2013|pages=3—7-3—8,3—15|date=September 1998}}&lt;/ref&gt; and not connected to a three-phase distribution, for instance, portable [[engine-generator]]s. Larger single-phase generators are also used in special applications such as single-phase [[traction power network|traction power]] for [[railway electrification system]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Hydropower Sustainability Assessment Tool|url=http://www.hydrosustainability.org/IHAHydro4Life/media/ProtocolAssessments/PDF%20Reports/Walchensee-Official-Assessment-FINAL-10-May-2013.pdf?ext=.pdf|publisher=E.ON Kraftwerke GmbH|accessdate=4 September 2013|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Designs==

===Revolving armature===
The design of revolving [[Armature (electrical engineering)|armature]] generators is to have the armature part on a [[Rotor (electric)|rotor]] and the magnetic field part on [[stator]]. A basic design, called '''elementary generator''',&lt;ref name="faa"&gt;{{cite book|title=Aviation Maintenance Technician Handbook—General (FAA-H-8083-30)|year=2008|url=http://www.faa.gov/regulations_policies/handbooks_manuals/aircraft/amt_handbook/media/FAA-8083-30_Ch10.pdf|publisher=Federal Aviation Administration|pages=10—130,10—161|accessdate=6 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; is to have a rectangular loop armature to cut the [[lines of force]] between the north and south poles. By cutting lines of force through rotation, it produces electric current. The current is sent out of the generator unit through two sets of [[slip ring]]s and [[Brush (electric)|brushes]], one of which is used for each end of the armature. In this two-pole design, as the armature rotates one revolution, it generates one cycle of [[Single-phase electric power|single phase]] alternating current (AC). To generate an AC output, the armature is rotated at a constant speed having the number of rotations per second to match the desired frequency (in [[hertz]]) of the AC output.

The relationship of armature rotation and the AC output can be seen in this series of pictures. Due to the circular motion of the armature against the straight lines of force, a variable number of lines of force will be cut even at a constant speed of the motion. At zero degrees, the rectangular arm of the armature does not cut any lines of force, giving zero voltage output. As the armature arm rotates at a constant speed toward the 90° position, more lines are cut. The lines of force are cut at most when the armature is at the 90° position, giving out the most current on one direction. As it turns toward the 180° position, lesser number of lines of force are cut, giving out lesser voltage until it becomes zero again at the 180° position. The voltage starts to increase again as the armature heads to the opposite pole at the 270° position. Toward this position, the current is generated on the opposite direction, giving out the maximum voltage on the opposite side. The voltage decrease again as it completes the full rotation. In one rotation, the AC output is produced with one  complete cycle as represented in the [[sine wave]].

[[File:Armature of single-phase generator with 4 windings.jpg|thumb|right|Armature of revolving armature single-phase generator with 4 windings and its output sine wave.]]
[[File:Single phase generator with four poles.jpg|thumb|left|Single phase generator with four poles]]

More poles can also be added to single-phase generator to allow one rotation to produce more than one cycle of AC output. In an example on the left, the stator part is reconfigured to have 4 poles which are equally spaced. A north pole is adjacent to the two south poles. The shape of the armature at the rotor part is also changed. It is no longer a flat rectangle. The arm is bent 90 degrees. This allows one side of the armature to interact with a north pole while the other side interacts with a south pole similarly to the two-pole configuration. The current is still delivered out through the two sets of slip rings and brushes in the same fashion as in the two-pole configuration. The difference is that a cycle of AC output can be completed after a 180 degree rotation of the armature. In one rotation, the AC output will be two cycles. This increases the frequency of the output of the generator. More poles can be added to achieves higher frequency at the same rotation speed of the generator, or same frequency of output at the lower rotation speed of the generator depending on the applications.

This design also allows us to increase the output voltage by modifying the shape of the armature. We can add more rectangular loops to the armature as seen on the picture on the right. The additional loops at the armature arm are connected in series, which are actually additional windings of the same conductor wire to form a coil in rectangular shape. In this example, there are 4 windings in the coil. Since the shapes of all windings are the same, the amount of the lines of force will be cut at the same amount in the same direction at the same time in all windings. This creates [[in phase]] AC output for these 4 windings. As a result, the output voltage is increased 4 time as shown in the sine wave in the diagram.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=AC Motors and Generators|url=https://archive.org/details/gov.dod.dimoc.29943|publisher=US Department of Defense|accessdate=5 September 2013|year=1961}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Revolving field===
[[File:Diagram of single-phase generator with two poles.svg|thumb|Diagram of revolving field single-phase generator with two poles]]
[[File:Diagram of single-phase generator with four poles.svg|thumb|Diagram of revolving field single-phase generator with four poles]]
The design of revolving field generators is to have the armature part on stator and the magnetic field part on rotor. A basic design of revolving field single-phase generator is shown on the right. There are two magnetic poles, north and south, attached to a rotor and two coils which are connected in series and equally spaced on stator. The windings of the two coils are in reverse direction to have the current to flow in the same direction because the two coils always interact with opposing polarities. Since poles and coils are equally spaced and the locations of the poles match to the locations of the coils, the magnetic lines of force are cut at the same amount at any degree of the rotor. As a result, the voltages induced to all windings have the same value at any given time. The voltages from both coils are "[[in phase]]" to each other. Therefore the total output voltage is two times the voltage induced in each winding. In the figure, at the position where pole number 1 and coil number 1 meet, the generator produces the highest output voltage on one direction. As the rotor turns 180 degrees, the output voltage is alternated to produce the highest voltage on the other direction.&lt;ref name="faa"/&gt; The frequency of the AC output in this case equals to the number of rotations of the rotor per second.&lt;ref name="navy"/&gt;

This design can also allow us to increase the output frequency by adding more poles. In this example on the right, we have 4 coils connected in series on the stator and the field rotor has 4 poles. Both coils and poles are equally spaced. Each pole has opposite polarity to its neighbors which are angled at 90 degrees. Each coils also have opposite winding to its neighbors. This configuration allows the lines of force at 4 poles to be cut by 4 coils at the same amount at a given time. At each 90-degree rotation, the voltage output polarity is switched from one direction to the other. Therefore, there are 4 cycles of the AC output in one rotation. As the 4 coils are wired in series and their outputs are "in phase", the AC output of this single-phase generator will have 4 times the voltage of that generated by each individual coil.&lt;ref name="faa"/&gt;

A benefit of the revolving field design is that if the poles are [[permanent magnets]], then there is no need to use any slip ring and brush to deliver electricity out of the generator as the coils are stationary and can be wired directly from the generator to the external loads.

==Small generators==
Single-phase generators that people are familiar with are usually small. The applications are for [[standby generator]]s in case of main power supply is interrupted and for supplying temporary power on construction sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Brumbach|first=Michael E.|title=Industrial electricity|publisher=Delmar|location=Clifton Park, N.Y.|isbn=9781435483743|page=418|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vRQe9XexjeMC&amp;pg=PA418&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=cS0xUqsjiai0BoHUgXg&amp;ved=0CGoQ6AEwBw#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|edition=8th}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another application is in [[small wind turbine|small wind technology]]. Although most of [[wind turbine]]s use three-phase generators, single-phase generators are found in some of the small wind turbine models with rated power outputs of up with 55&amp;nbsp;kW. The single-phase models are available in the [[vertical axis wind turbine]]s (VAWT) and Horizontal-axis wind turbines (HAWT).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Endurance E-3120-50 kW Wind Turbine from Endurance Wind Power|url=http://www.azocleantech.com/news.aspx?newsID=10161|accessdate=20 September 2013|newspaper=AZoNetwork|date=13 May 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Forsyth|first=Trudy|title=Small Wind Technology|url=http://ww2.wapa.gov/sites/western/renewables/Documents/webcast/2SmallWindtech.pdf|publisher=National Renewable Energy Laboratory|accessdate=20 September 2013|date=20 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the very early days of electricity generation, the generators at [[power station]]s had been single-phase AC or [[direct current]]. The direction of the power industry were changing in 1895 when more efficient [[Polyphase coil|polyphase generators]] were successfully implemented at [[Adams Power Plant Transformer House|Adams Hydroelectric Generating Plant]] which was the first large-scale [[Polyphase system|polyphase power]] station.&lt;ref name="nyc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Milestones:Adams Hydroelectric Generating Plant, 1895|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Adams_Hydroelectric_Generating_Plant,_1895|publisher=IEEE Global History Network|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Newer power stations started to adopt the polyphase system. In the 1900s, many railways started the [[Railway electrification system|electrification]] of their lines. During that time, the single-phase AC system had been widely used for their [[traction power network]]s beside the direct current system. The early generators for those single-phase traction networks are single-phase generators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Western Electrician, Volume 37|year=1906|publisher=Electrician Publishing Company|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=h3s2AQAAMAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=xTwxUsznHsjHtQaQvIG4DQ&amp;ved=0CEIQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even with newer three-phase motors which were introduced to some modern trains, the single-phases transmission for traction networks survive their time and are still in use in many railways today.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Mochizuki|first=Asahi|title=JRTR Speed-up Story 2 Part 2: Speeding-up Conventional Lines and Shinkansen|journal=Japan Railway &amp; Transport Review|date=October 2011|issue=58|url=http://www.jrtr.net/jrtr58/pdf/51-60web.pdf|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, many traction power stations have replaced their generators over time to use three-phase generators and convert into single-phase for transmission.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Railway Power Stations of New York City|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/The_Railway_Power_Stations_of_New_York_City|publisher=IEEE Global History Network|accessdate=12 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Hydro===
In the early development of [[hydroelectricity]], single-phase generators played an important role in demonstrating the benefits of alternating current. In 1891, a 3,000 volts and 133&amp;nbsp;Hz single-phase generator of 100 [[horsepower]] was installed at [[Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant]] which was belt-connected with Pelton water wheel. The power was transmitted through {{convert|4.2|km}} cables to power an identical motor at the mill. The plant was the first to generate alternating current electric power for industrial application and it was a demonstration of the efficiency in AC transmission. This was a precedent to larger for much larger plants such as the [[Adams Power Plant Transformer House|Edward Dean Adams Power Plant]] in [[Niagara Falls, New York]] in 1895.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Milestones:Ames Hydroelectric Generating Plant, 1891|url=http://www.ieeeghn.org/wiki/index.php/Milestones:Ames_Hydroelectric_Generating_Plant,_1891|publisher=IEEE Global History Network|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the larger plants were operated using polyphase generators for greater efficiency. That left the applications for single-phase hydroelectricity generation to special cases such as in light loads.

An example of using single-phase in a special case was implemented in 1902 at St. Louis Municipal Electric Power Plant. A 20&amp;nbsp;kW single-phase generator was direct-connected to a Pelton water wheel to generate electricity enough to power light loads. This was an early demonstration of [[in-conduit hydro]] to capture energy from water flow in the [[public water supply|public water]] [[Pipeline transport|pipeline]]. The energy for the water main in this case was not created by gravity, but the water was pumped by a larger steam engine at a water pumping station to supply water to customers. The decision to have water pumped by a larger engine then take some of the energy from water flow to power a smaller generator using water wheel was based on the cost. At the time, steam engines were not efficient and cost effective for a 20&amp;nbsp;kW system. Therefore, they installed a steam water pump to have enough energy to maintain water pressure for customer and to drive a small generator at the same time.&lt;ref name="st.louis"/&gt;

The main usage of single-phase hydroelectricity generation today is to supply power for traction network for railways. Many electrical transmission networks for railways especially in Germany rely on single-phase generation and transmission which are still in use today. A notable power station is [[Walchensee Hydroelectric Power Station]] in [[Bavaria]]. The station takes water from elevated [[Walchensee|Lake Walchensee]] to drive eight turbines that drive the generators. Four of those are three-phase generators to supply the [[power grid]]. The other four are single-phase generators are connected to Pelton turbines which have combined capacity of 52 MW to supply the German [[15 kV AC railway electrification]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Walchensee Power Plant. A Technological Jewel in the Alps.|url=http://apps.eon.com/documents/EWK_Walchensee_2010_e_eng.pdf|publisher=e.on Wesserkraft|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similar single-phase hydroelectricity generations are also used in another variance of railway electrification system in the United States. A power station at [[Safe Harbor Dam]] in [[Pennsylvania]] provides power generation for both public utilities and for [[Amtrak]] railway. Two out of its 14 turbines are connected to two single-phase generators to supply [[Amtrak's 25 Hz traction power system]]. The two turbines are of [[Kaplan turbine|Kaplan]] type with 5 blades rated 42,500 horsepower.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Facts &amp; Figures|url=http://www.shwpc.com/facts_figures.html|publisher=Safe Harbor Water Power Corporation|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steam===
In the early years, steam engines were used as prime movers of generators. An installation at [[St. Louis]] Municipal Electric Power Plant in the 1900s was an example of using steam engines with single-phase generators. The St. Louis plant used [[compound steam engine]] to drive a 100&amp;nbsp;kW single-phase generator which produced current at rated power of 1,150 volts.&lt;ref name=st.louis&gt;{{cite journal|title=St Louis Municipal Electric Power Plant|journal=Western Electrician|volume=30|issue=1-26|page=387|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tZNVAAAAYAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The steam engines were also used during the twentieth century in power stations for traction networks which had single-phase power distribution for specific railways. A special set of single-phase generators with steam turbines at Waterside Generating Station in [[New York City]] in 1938 was an example of such generation and distribution systems. The single-phase generators were eventually retired in the late 1970s due to concerns of a turbine failure in another station. The generators were replaced by two transformers to reduce from another three-phase power source to existing single-phase [[Overhead line|catenary]] power. Eventually, the transformers were replaced by two solid-state [[cycloconverter]] instead.&lt;ref name="nyc"/&gt;

===Nuclear===
Normally, [[nuclear power plants]] are used as [[base load power plant|base load]] stations with very high capacities to supply power to the grids. [[Neckarwestheim Nuclear Power Plant|Neckarwestheim I]] in [[Neckarwestheim]] is a unique nuclear power plant in that it is equipped with high-capacity single-phase generators to supply [[Deutsche Bahn]] railway with specific AC voltage at frequency of 16 2/3&amp;nbsp;Hz. The [[pressurized water reactor]] transport thermal energy to two turbines and generators which are rated for 187 MW and 152 MW.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Neckarwestheim I darf nicht länger laufen.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14553">The '''sliding criterion''' (discontinuity) is a tool to estimate easily the [[Shear strength (Discontinuity)|shear strength]] properties of a [[Discontinuity (Geotechnical engineering)|discontinuity]] in a [[Rock (geology)|rock]] mass based on visual and tactile (i.e. by feeling) characterization of the [[Discontinuity (Geotechnical engineering)|discontinuity]].&lt;ref name=HackPrice1995/&gt;&lt;ref name=Hack1998/&gt;&lt;ref name=HackPriceRengers/&gt;&lt;ref name=Price2008/&gt; The shear strength of a discontinuity is important in, for example, [[tunnel]], [[Foundation (engineering)|foundation]], or [[Slope stability analysis|slope]] engineering, but also stability of [[Slope stability|natural slopes]] is often governed by the shear strength along discontinuities.

The ''sliding-angle'' is based on the ease with which a block of rock material can move over a discontinuity and hence is comparable to the ''tilt-angle'' as determined with the [[Tilt test (Geotechnical engineering)|''tilt test'']], but on a larger scale. The ''sliding criterion'' has been developed for stresses that would occur in slopes between {{convert|2|and|25|m|ft}}, hence, in the order of maximum {{convert|0.6|MPa}}. The ''sliding criterion'' is based on back analyses of slope instability and earlier work of [[ISRM]]&lt;ref name=ISRMbluebook/&gt; and Laubscher.&lt;ref name=Laubscher/&gt; The ''sliding criterion'' is part of the [[Slope Stability Probability Classification]] (SSPC)&lt;ref name=HackPriceRengers/&gt; system for slope stability analyses.

==Sliding-angle==
The '''sliding-angle''' is calculated as follows:

{{nb5}} &lt;math&gt;''sliding-angle''&lt;/math&gt; &lt;math&gt; =\frac{Rl * Rs * Im * Ka}{0.0113}&lt;/math&gt;

::where ''sliding-angle'' is in degrees, and
::''Rl'' = roughness large scale
::''Rs'' = roughness small scale
::''Im'' = infill material in the discontinuity
::''Ka'' = karst; presence of karst (solution) features along the discontinuity
(The values for the parameters are listed in table 1 and explained below)

[[File:SlidingcriterionRl.jpg|right|thumb|Figure 1. Large scale example roughness graphs.]]

===Roughness large scale (''Rl'')===
The roughness large scale (''Rl'') is based on visual comparison of the trace (with a length of about 1 m) or surface (with an area of about 1 x 1 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of a [[Discontinuity (Geotechnical engineering)|discontinuity]] with the example graphs in figure 1. This results in a descriptive term: ''wavy, slightly wavy, curved, slightly curved'', or ''straight''.  The corresponding factor for ''Rl'' is listed in table 1.&lt;br /&gt;
The ''roughness large scale (Rl)'' contributes only to the friction along the discontinuity when the walls on both sides of the discontinuity are fitting, i.e. the [[Asperity (Geotechnical engineering)|asperities]] on both discontinuity walls match. If the discontinuity is non-fitting, the factor ''Rl'' = 0.75.

[[File:SlidingcriterionRs.jpg|right|thumb|Figure 2. Small scale example roughness graphs.]]

===Roughness small scale (''Rs'')===
The roughness small scale (''Rs'') is established visually and tactile (by feeling). 
The first term ''rough'', ''smooth'', or ''polished'' is established by feeling the surface of the [[Discontinuity (Geotechnical engineering)|discontinuity]]; ''rough'' hurts when fingers are moved over the surface with some (little) force, ''smooth'' feels that there is resistance to the fingers, while ''polished'' gives a feeling about similar to the surface of glass.&lt;br /&gt;
The second term is established visually. The trace (with a length of about 0.2 m) or surface (with an area of about 0.2 x 0.2 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; of a [[Discontinuity (Geotechnical engineering)|discontinuity]] is compared with the example graphs in figure 2; this gives ''stepped'', ''undulating'', or ''planar''. The two terms of visual and tactile give a combined term and the corresponding factor is listed in table 1.&lt;br /&gt;
The visual part of the ''roughness small scale (Rs)'' contributes only to the friction along the discontinuity if the walls on both sides of the discontinuity are ''fitting'', i.e. the [[Asperity (Geotechnical engineering)|asperities]] on both discontinuity walls match. If the discontinuity is non-fitting, the visual part of the ''roughness small scale (Rs)'' should be taken as ''planar'' for the calculation of the ''sliding-angle'', and hence, the ''roughness small scale (Rs)'' can be only ''rough planar, smooth planar, or polished planar''.

===Infill in discontinuity (''Im'')===
Infill material in a discontinuity has often a marked influence on the shear characteristics. The different options for infill material are listed in table 1, and below follows a short explanation for each option.

====Cemented discontinuity or cemented infill====
A ''cemented discontinuity'' or a ''discontinuity with cemented infill'' has higher shear strength than a non-cemented discontinuity if the cement or cemented infill is bonded to ''both'' discontinuity walls. Note that cement and cement bounds that are stronger than the surrounding intact rock ceases the discontinuity to be a mechanical plane of weakness, and, hence, the 'sliding-angle' has no validity.

====No infill====
''No infill'' describes a discontinuity that may have coated walls but no other infill.

====Non-softening infill====
''Non-softening'' infill material is material that does not change in shear characteristics under the influence of water nor under the influence of shear displacement. The material may break but no greasing effect will occur. The material particles can roll but this is considered to be of minor influence because, after small displacements, the material particles generally will still be very angular. This is further sub-divided in ''coarse'', ''medium'', and ''fine'' for the size of the grains in the infill material or the size of the grains or minerals in the discontinuity wall. The larger of the two should be used for the description. The thickness of the infill can be very thin, sometimes not more than a dust coating.

====Softening infill====
Softening infill material will under the influence of water or displacements, attain in lower shear strength and will act as a lubricating agent.
This is further sub-divided in ''coarse'', ''medium'', and ''fine'' for the size of the grains in the infill material or the size of the grains or minerals in the discontinuity wall. The larger of the two should be used for the description. The thickness of the infill can be very thin, sometimes not more than a dust coating.

====Gouge infill====
Gouge infill means a relatively thick and continuous layer of infill material, mainly consisting of clay but may contain rock fragments. The clay material surrounds the rock fragments in the clay completely or partly, so that these are not in contact with both discontinuity walls. A sub-division is made between ''less thick'' and ''thicker'' than the amplitude of the roughness of the discontinuity walls. If the thickness is less than the amplitude of the roughness, the shear strength will be influenced by the wall material and the discontinuity walls will be in contact after a certain displacement. If the infill is thicker than the amplitude, the friction of the discontinuity is fully governed by the infill.

====Flowing material infill====
Very weak and not compacted infill in discontinuities flows out of the discontinuities under its own weight or as a consequence of a very small trigger force (such as water pressure, vibrations due to traffic or the excavation process, etc.).

===Karst (''Ka'')===
The presence of solution ([[karst]]) features along the discontinuity.

{{Infobox sodium}}
'''Sodium''' is a [[chemical element]] with symbol&amp;nbsp;'''Na''' (from Latin ''natrium'') and [[atomic number]]&amp;nbsp;11. It is a soft, silvery-white, highly reactive [[metal]]. Sodium is an [[alkali metal]], being in [[group 1 element|group 1]] of the periodic table, because it has a single electron in its outer shell that it readily donates, creating a positively charged ion—the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; [[cation]]. Its only stable [[isotope]] is &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Na. The free metal does not occur in nature, but must be prepared from compounds. Sodium is the [[Abundance of elements in Earth's crust|sixth most abundant element in the Earth's crust]] and exists in numerous [[minerals]] such as [[feldspar]]s, [[sodalite]], and [[halite|rock salt]] (NaCl). Many salts of sodium are highly water-soluble: sodium ions have been [[Leaching (chemistry)|leached]] by the action of water from the [[Earth|Earth's]] [[mineral]]s over eons, and thus sodium and [[chlorine]] are the most common dissolved elements by weight in the oceans.

Sodium was first isolated by [[Humphry Davy]] in 1807 by the [[electrolysis]] of [[sodium hydroxide]]. Among many other useful sodium compounds, [[sodium hydroxide]] ([[lye]]) is used in [[Soap|soap manufacture]], and [[sodium chloride]] ([[edible salt]]) is a [[De-ice|de-icing]] agent and a nutrient for animals including humans.

Sodium is an [[Dietary mineral|essential element]] for all animals and some plants. Sodium ions are the major cation in the [[extracellular fluid]] (ECF) and as such are the major contributor to the ECF [[osmotic pressure]] and ECF compartment volume. Loss of water from the ECF compartment increases the sodium concentration, a condition called [[hypernatremia]]. [[Tonicity|Isotonic]] loss of water and sodium from the ECF compartment decreases the size of that compartment in a condition called ECF [[hypovolemia]].

By means of the [[Na+/K+-ATPase|sodium-potassium pump]], living human cells pump three sodium ions out of the cell in exchange for two potassium ions pumped in; comparing ion concentrations across the cell membrane, inside to outside, [[potassium]] measures about 40:1, and sodium, about 1:10. In [[Neuron|nerve cells]], the electrical charge across the cell membrane enables transmission of the nerve impulse—an [[action potential]]—when the charge is dissipated; sodium plays a key role in that activity.

==Characteristics==

===Physical===
[[File:Na-D-sodium D-lines-589nm.jpg|thumb|left|[[Emission spectrum]] for sodium, showing the [[Fraunhofer lines|D line]].]]
Sodium at [[standard temperature and pressure]] is a soft silvery metal that combines with oxygen in the air and forms grayish white [[sodium oxide]] unless immersed in oil or inert gas, which are the conditions it is usually stored in. Sodium metal can be easily cut with a knife and is a good conductor of electricity and heat because it has only one electron in its valence shell, resulting in weak [[metallic bonding]] and free electrons, which carry energy. Due to having low atomic mass and large atomic radius, sodium is third-least dense of all elemental metals and is one of only three metals that can float on water, the other two being lithium and potassium.&lt;ref name=Greenwood75&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 75&lt;/ref&gt; The melting (98&amp;nbsp;°C) and boiling (883&amp;nbsp;°C) points of sodium are lower than those of lithium but higher than those of the heavier alkali metals potassium, rubidium, and caesium, following periodic trends down the group.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/science-and-technology/chemistry/compounds-and-elements/alkali-metals|title="Alkali Metals." Science of Everyday Things|work=Encyclopedia.com|accessdate=15 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; These properties change dramatically at elevated pressures: at 1.5 [[Bar (unit)|Mbar]], the color changes from silvery metallic to black; at 1.9 Mbar the material becomes transparent with a red color; and at 3 Mbar, sodium is a clear and transparent solid. All of these high-pressure [[allotrope]]s are insulators and [[electride]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gatti|first1=M.|last2=Tokatly|first2=I.|last3=Rubio|first3=A.|date=2010|title=Sodium: A Charge-Transfer Insulator at High Pressures|journal=[[Physical Review Letters]]|volume=104|issue=21|page=216404|pmid=20867123|doi=10.1103/PhysRevLett.104.216404|bibcode=2010PhRvL.104u6404G|arxiv = 1003.0540 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Isotopes===
{{main|Isotopes of sodium}}
Twenty isotopes of sodium are known, but only &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Na is stable. &lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt;Na is created in the [[carbon-burning process]] in stars by fusing two [[carbon]] atoms together; this requires temperatures above 600 megakelvins and a star of at least three solar masses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1987SvAL...13..214D|title= Sodium Synthesis in Hydrogen Burning Stars|last1=Denisenkov |first=P.

==Chemistry==
Sodium atoms have 11 electrons, one more than the extremely stable configuration of the [[noble gas]] [[neon]]. Because of this and its low first [[ionization energy]] of 495.8&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol, the sodium atom is much more likely to lose the last electron and acquire a positive charge than to gain one and acquire a negative charge. This process requires so little energy that sodium is readily oxidized by giving up its 11th electron. In contrast, the second ionization energy is very high (4562&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol), because the 10th electron is closer to the nucleus than the 11th electron. As a result, sodium usually forms [[ionic compound]]s involving the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt; cation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Cambridge International AS and A Level Chemistry Coursebook|author=Lawrie Ryan|author2= Roger Norris|publisher=Cambridge University Press, 2014|edition=illustrated|isbn=1-107-63845-3|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The most common oxidation state for sodium is +1. It is generally less reactive than [[potassium]] and more reactive than [[lithium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=De Leon|first=N.|title=Reactivity of Alkali Metals|url=http://www.iun.edu/~cpanhd/C101webnotes/modern-atomic-theory/alkali-reac.html|publisher=[[Indiana University Northwest]]|accessdate=2007-12-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium metal is highly reducing, with the [[standard reduction potential]] for the Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;/Na couple being −2.71 volts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Atkins|first1=Peter W.|last2=de Paula|first2=Julio|title=Physical Chemistry|date=2002|edition=7th|publisher=W.

Sodium compounds are of immense commercial importance, being particularly central to industries producing [[glass]], [[paper]], [[soap]], and [[textile]]s.&lt;ref name=Ullmann/&gt; The most important sodium compounds are [[table salt]] (Na[[chloride|Cl]]), [[soda ash]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[carbonate|CO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]), [[baking soda]] (Na[[Bicarbonate|HCO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]), [[sodium hydroxide|caustic soda]] (NaOH), [[sodium nitrate]] (Na[[nitrate|NO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]), di- and tri-sodium phosphates, [[sodium thiosulfate]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[thiosulfate|S&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;]]·5H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O), and [[borax]] (Na&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;[[boron|B]]&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;O&lt;sub&gt;7&lt;/sub&gt;·10H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O).&lt;ref name="Holl"/&gt; In compounds, sodium is usually [[ionic bond|ionically bonded]] to water and anions and is viewed as a [[HSAB|hard]] [[Lewis acid]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Cowan|first=James A.|title=Inorganic Biochemistry: An Introduction|date=1997|publisher=Wiley-VCH|isbn=978-0-471-18895-7|page=7|oclc=34515430}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SodiumSterateChemStr.png|thumb|center|upright=1.4|Two equivalent images of the chemical structure of [[sodium stearate]], a typical soap.]]
Most [[soap]]s are sodium salts of [[fatty acid]]s. Sodium soaps have a higher melting temperature (and seem "harder") than potassium soaps.&lt;ref name="Holl"&gt;{{cite book|publisher=Walter de Gruyter|date=1985|edition=91–100|pages=931–943|isbn=3-11-007511-3|title=Lehrbuch der Anorganischen Chemie|last1=Holleman|first1=Arnold F.|last2=Wiberg|first2=Egon|last3=Wiberg|first3=Nils|language=German}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Like all the [[alkali metal]]s, sodium reacts [[Exothermic reaction|exothermically]] with water, and sufficiently large pieces melt to a sphere and may explode.  The reaction produces caustic soda ([[sodium hydroxide]]) and flammable [[hydrogen]] gas. When burned in air, it forms primarily [[sodium peroxide]] with some [[sodium oxide]].&lt;ref name=Greenwood84&gt;Greenwoood and Earnshaw, p. 84&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aqueous solutions===
Sodium tends to form water-soluble compounds, such as [[halides]], [[sulfate]]s, [[nitrates]], [[carboxylates]] and [[carbonate]]s. The main aqueous species are the aquo complexes [Na(H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O)&lt;sub&gt;''n''&lt;/sub&gt;]&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, where ''n'' = 4–8; with ''n'' = 6 indicated from X-ray diffraction data and computer simulations.&lt;ref name=Lincoln&gt;{{cite book|doi=10.1016/B0-08-043748-6/01055-0|title=Comprehensive Coordination Chemistry II|date=2004|isbn=978-0-08-043748-4|page=515|chapter=Metal Aqua Ions|last1=Lincoln|first1=S. F.|last2=Richens|first2=D. T.|last3=Sykes|first3=A. G.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Direct precipitation of sodium salts from aqueous solutions is rare because sodium salts typically have a high affinity for water; an exception is [[sodium bismuthate]] (NaBiO&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lange's Handbook of Chemistry|publisher=McGraw-Hill|date=1998|isbn=0-07-016384-7|last1=Dean|first1=John Aurie|last2=Lange|first2=Norbert Adolph}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of this, sodium salts are usually isolated as solids by evaporation or by precipitation with an organic solvent, such as [[ethanol]]; for example, only 0.35&amp;nbsp;g/L of sodium chloride will dissolve in ethanol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Burgess|first= J.|title=Metal Ions in Solution|publisher=Ellis Horwood|location=New York|date=1978|isbn=0-85312-027-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Crown ether]]s, like [[15-crown-5]], may be used as a [[phase-transfer catalyst]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Starks|first1=Charles M.|last2=Liotta|first2=Charles L.|last3=Halpern|first3=Marc|title=Phase-Transfer Catalysis: Fundamentals, Applications, and Industrial Perspectives|date=1994|publisher=Chapman &amp; Hall|page=162|isbn=978-0-412-04071-9|oclc=28027599}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sodium content in bulk may be determined by treating with a large excess of [[uranyl zinc acetate]]; the hexahydrate (UO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;ZnNa(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;)·6H&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;O precipitates and [[gravimetry|can be weighed]].

===Electrides and sodides===
Like the other alkali metals, sodium dissolves in ammonia and some amines to give deeply colored solutions; evaporation of these solutions leaves a shiny film of metallic sodium. The solutions contain the [[coordination complex]] (Na(NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, with the positive charge counterbalanced by [[electride|electrons as anions]]; [[cryptand]]s permit the isolation of these complexes as crystalline solids. Sodium forms complexes with crown ethers, cryptands and other ligands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Applications of the Newer Techniques of Analysis|editor=Ivor L. Simmons|publisher=Springer Science &amp; Business Media, 2012|isbn=1-4684-3318-0|page=160}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, [[15-crown-5]] has a high affinity for sodium because the cavity size of 15-crown-5 is 1.7–2.2&amp;nbsp;Å, which is enough to fit sodium ion (1.9&amp;nbsp;Å).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Design, Fabrication, Properties and Applications of Smart and Advanced Materials|editor=Xu Hou|publisher=CRC Press, 2016|edition=illustrated|isbn=1-4987-2249-0|page=175}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Anionic Polymerization: Principles, Practice, Strength, Consequences and Applications|editor=Nikos Hadjichristidis|editor2=Akira Hirao|

===Organosodium compounds===
[[File:Monensin2.png|thumb|The structure of the complex of sodium (Na&lt;sup&gt;+&lt;/sup&gt;, shown in yellow) and the antibiotic [[monensin]]-A.]]
Many organosodium compounds have been prepared. Because of the high polarity of the C-Na bonds, they behave like sources of [[carbanion]]s (salts with organic [[anion]]s). Some well-known derivatives include [[sodium cyclopentadienide]] (NaC&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;) and trityl sodium ((C&lt;sub&gt;6&lt;/sub&gt;H&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;CNa).&lt;ref&gt;{{OrgSynth |first1=W.

===Intermetallic compounds===
Sodium forms alloys with many metals, such as potassium, [[calcium]], [[lead]], and the [[group 11 element|group 11]] and [[group 12 elements|12]] elements. Sodium and potassium form KNa&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and [[NaK]]. NaK is 40–90% potassium and it is liquid at [[ambient temperature]]. It is an excellent thermal and electrical conductor. Sodium-calcium alloys are by-products of the electrolytic production of sodium from a binary salt mixture of NaCl-CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; and ternary mixture NaCl-CaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;-BaCl&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;. Calcium is only partially [[miscible]] with sodium. In a liquid state, sodium is completely miscible with lead. There are several methods to make sodium-lead alloys. One is to melt them together and another is to deposit sodium electrolytically on molten lead cathodes. NaPb&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, NaPb, Na&lt;sub&gt;9&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, Na&lt;sub&gt;5&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and Na&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt;Pb&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt; are some of the known sodium-lead alloys. Sodium also forms alloys with [[gold]] (NaAu&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;) and [[silver]] (NaAg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;). Group 12 metals ([[zinc]], [[cadmium]] and [[Mercury (element)|mercury]]) are known to make alloys with sodium. NaZn&lt;sub&gt;13&lt;/sub&gt; and NaCd&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; are alloys of zinc and cadmium. Sodium and mercury form NaHg, NaHg&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;, NaHg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Hg&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and Na&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;Hg.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Alloys: Preparation, Properties, Applications|last=Habashi|first=Fathi|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, 2008|isbn=3-527-61192-4|pages=278–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Because of its importance in human metabolism, salt has long been an important commodity, as shown by the English word ''salary'', which derives from ''salarium'', the wafers of salt sometimes given to Roman soldiers along with their other wages. In medieval Europe, a compound of sodium with the Latin name of ''sodanum'' was used as a [[headache]] remedy. The name sodium is thought to originate from the Arabic ''suda'', meaning headache, as the headache-alleviating properties of sodium carbonate or soda were well known in early times.&lt;ref name=newton&gt;{{cite book|last=Newton|first=David E.|editor-last=Baker|editor-first=Lawrence W.|title=Chemical Elements|date=1999|isbn=978-0-7876-2847-5|oclc=39778687}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Although sodium, sometimes called ''soda'', had long been recognized in compounds, the metal itself was not isolated until 1807 by [[Humphry Davy|Sir Humphry Davy]] through the [[electrolysis]] of [[sodium hydroxide]].&lt;ref name=Davy1807&gt;{{cite journal|first=Humphry|last=Davy|title=On some new phenomena of chemical changes produced by electricity, particularly the decomposition of the fixed alkalies, and the exhibition of the new substances which constitute their bases; and on the general nature of alkaline bodies|date=1808|volume=98|journal=Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society of London|pages=1–44|url=https://books.google.com/?id=gpwEAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA57|doi=10.1098/rstl.1808.0001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="weeks"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1021/ed009p1035|title=The discovery of the elements.

Or perhaps one finds it yet more advisable for the present to create two classes, ''metals'' and ''metalloids'', and to place ''Kalium'' and ''Natronium'' in the latter — Gilbert.)&lt;/ref&gt;  The chemical abbreviation for sodium was first published in 1814 by [[Jöns Jakob Berzelius]] in his system of atomic symbols,&lt;ref&gt;J.

Sodium imparts an intense yellow color to flames. As early as 1860, [[Gustav Kirchhoff|Kirchhoff]] and [[Robert Bunsen|Bunsen]] noted the high sensitivity of a sodium flame test, and stated in [[Annalen der Physik|Annalen der Physik und Chemie]]:&lt;ref name="bunsen1"&gt;{{cite journal|doi =10.1002/andp.18601860602| title=Chemische Analyse durch Spectralbeobachtungen|date=1860 |last1=Kirchhoff |first1=G.|last2=Bunsen|first2=R. |journal=Annalen der Physik und Chemie |volume=186|issue=6 |pages=161–189|bibcode=1860AnP...186..161K}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;In a corner of our 60&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; room farthest away from the apparatus, we exploded 3&amp;nbsp;mg of sodium chlorate with milk sugar while observing the nonluminous flame before the slit. After a while, it glowed a bright yellow and showed a strong sodium line that disappeared only after 10 minutes. From the weight of the sodium salt and the volume of air in the room, we easily calculate that one part by weight of air could not contain more than 1/20 millionth weight of sodium.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Occurrence==
The Earth's crust contains 2.27% sodium, making it the [[Abundance of the chemical elements|seventh most abundant element]] on Earth and the fifth most abundant metal, behind [[aluminium]], [[iron]], [[calcium]], and [[magnesium]] and ahead of potassium.&lt;ref name=Greenwood69&gt;Greenwood and Earnshaw, p. 69&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium's estimated oceanic abundance is 1.08{{e|4}} milligrams per liter.&lt;ref name = "abundancecrc"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kTnxSi2B2FcC|title=CRC Handbook of Chemistry and Physics, 84th Edition|last=Lide|first=David R.|date=2003-06-19|publisher=CRC Press|isbn=978-0-8493-0484-2|series=[[CRC Handbook]]|at=14: Abundance of Elements in the Earth's Crust and in the Sea|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because of its high reactivity, it is never found as a pure element. It is found in many different minerals, some very soluble, such as [[halite]] and [[natron]], others much less soluble, such as [[amphibole]] and [[zeolite]].  The insolubility of certain sodium minerals such as [[cryolite]] and [[feldspar]] arises from their polymeric anions, which in the case of feldspar is a polysilicate.

===Astronomical observations===
Atomic sodium has a very strong [[spectral line]] in the yellow-orange part of the spectrum (the same line as is used in [[Sodium-vapor lamp|sodium vapour street lights]]). This appears as an [[absorption line]] in many types of stars, including the [[Sun]]. The line was first studied in 1814 by [[Joseph von Fraunhofer]] during his investigation of the lines in the solar spectrum, now known as the [[Fraunhofer lines]]. Fraunhofer named it the 'D line', although it is now known to actually be a group of closely spaced lines split by a [[fine structure|fine]] and [[hyperfine structure]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=D-lines {{!}} spectroscopy|url=https://www.britannica.com/topic/D-lines|website=Encyclopedia Britannica|accessdate=6 November 2017|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The strength of the D line means it has been detected in many other astronomical environments. In stars, it is seen in any whose surfaces are cool enough for sodium to exist in atomic form (rather than ionised). This corresponds to stars of roughly [[F-type main sequence star|F-type]] and cooler. Many other stars appear to have a sodium absorption line, but this is actually caused by gas in the foreground [[interstellar medium]]. The two can be distinguished via high-resolution spectroscopy, because interstellar lines are much narrower than those broadened by [[stellar rotation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|bibcode=1994ApJ...436..152W|doi=10.1086/174889|title=A high-resolution survey of interstellar NA I D1 lines|journal=The Astrophysical Journal|volume=436|pages=152|year=1994|last1=Welty|first1=Daniel E|last2=Hobbs|first2=L.

The high demand for aluminium created the need for the production of sodium. The introduction of the [[Hall–Héroult process]] for the production of aluminium by [[Electrolysis|electrolysing]] a molten salt bath ended the need for large quantities of sodium. A related process based on the reduction of sodium hydroxide was developed in 1886.&lt;ref name=kirk/&gt;

Sodium is now produced commercially through the [[electrolysis]] of molten [[sodium chloride]], based on a process patented in 1924.&lt;ref name="pauling"&gt;Pauling, Linus, ''General Chemistry'', 1970 ed., Dover Publications&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="losal"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://periodic.lanl.gov/11.shtml|title=Los Alamos National Laboratory – Sodium|accessdate=2007-06-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is done in a [[Downs Cell|Downs cell]] in which the NaCl is mixed with [[calcium chloride]] to lower the [[melting point]] below 700&amp;nbsp;°C. As [[calcium]] is less [[electropositive]] than sodium, no calcium will be deposited at the cathode.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sodium Metal from France|publisher=DIANE Publishing|isbn=1-4578-1780-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; This method is less expensive than the previous [[Castner process]] (the electrolysis of [[sodium hydroxide]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Industrial Chemistry: For Advanced Students|author=Mark Anthony Benvenuto|publisher=Walter de Gruyter GmbH &amp; Co KG, 2015|edition=illustrated|isbn=3-11-038339-X}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The market for sodium is volatile due to the difficulty in its storage and shipping; it must be stored under a dry [[inert gas]] atmosphere or [[anhydrous]] [[mineral oil]] to prevent the formation of a surface layer of [[sodium oxide]] or [[sodium superoxide]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients: Development, Manufacturing, and Regulation, Second Edition|publisher=CRC Press, 2016|isbn=1-4398-0339-0|editor=Stanley Nusim|edition=2, illustrated, revised|page=303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applications==
Though metallic sodium has some important uses, the major applications for sodium use compounds; millions of tons of [[sodium chloride]], [[sodium hydroxide|hydroxide]], and [[sodium carbonate|carbonate]] are produced annually. Sodium chloride is extensively used for [[anti-icing]] and [[de-icing]] and as a preservative; examples of the uses of [[sodium bicarbonate]] include baking, as a raising agent, and [[sodablasting]]. Along with potassium, many important medicines have sodium added to improve their [[bioavailability]]; though potassium is the better ion in most cases, sodium is chosen for its lower price and atomic weight.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Remington|first=Joseph P.|title=Remington: The Science and Practice of Pharmacy|date=2006|publisher=Lippincott Williams &amp; Wilkins|isbn=978-0-7817-4673-1|pages=365–366|edition=21st|editor-last=Beringer|editor-first=Paul|oclc=60679584}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sodium hydride]] is used as a base for various reactions (such as the [[aldol reaction]]) in organic chemistry, and as a reducing agent in inorganic chemistry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wiberg|first1=Egon|last2=Wiberg|first2=Nils|last3=Holleman|first3=A.

Metallic sodium is used mainly for the production of [[sodium borohydride]], [[sodium azide]], [[indigo dye|indigo]], and [[triphenylphosphine]]. A once-common use was the making of [[tetraethyllead]] and titanium metal; because of the move away from TEL and new titanium production methods, the production of sodium declined after 1970.&lt;ref name=Ullmann&gt;Alfred Klemm, Gabriele Hartmann, Ludwig Lange, "Sodium and Sodium Alloys" in Ullmann's Encyclopedia of Industrial Chemistry 2005, Wiley-VCH, Weinheim. {{DOI|10.1002/14356007.a24_277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sodium is also used as an alloying metal, an [[anti-scaling agent]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LI4KmKqca78C&amp;pg=PA76|page=76|title=Metal cleaning: bibliographical abstracts, 1842–1951|last=Harris|first=Jay C.|date=1949|publisher=[[American Society for Testing and Materials]]|oclc=1848092}}&lt;/ref&gt; and as a reducing agent for metals when other materials are ineffective.

'''Steam''' is [[water]] in the [[gas]] phase, which is formed when water [[boiling|boils]]. Steam is invisible; however, "steam" often refers to wet steam, the visible [[mist]] or [[aerosol]] of water droplets formed as this [[water vapour]] [[condenses]]. At lower pressures, such as in the [[upper atmosphere]] or at the top of high mountains, water boils at a lower temperature than the nominal {{convert|100|°C|°F}} at [[standard temperature and pressure|standard pressure]]. If heated further it becomes [[superheated steam]]. 

The [[enthalpy of vaporization]] is the energy required to turn water into the gaseous form when it increases in [[volume]] by 1,700 times at standard temperature and pressure; this change in volume can be converted into [[Work (physics)|mechanical work]] by [[steam engine]]s such as reciprocating piston type engines and [[steam turbine]]s, which are a sub-group of steam engines. Piston type steam engines played a central role to the [[Industrial Revolution]] and modern steam turbines are used to generate more than 80% of the world's [[electricity]]. If liquid water comes in contact with a very hot surface or depressurizes quickly below its [[vapor pressure]], it can create a [[steam explosion]]. 

==Types of steam and conversions==
Steam is traditionally created by heating a boiler via burning coal and other fuels, but it is also possible to create steam with solar energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ijthermalsci.2012.01.012 |title=Characterization of light-induced, volumetric steam generation in nanofluids |year=2012 |last1=Taylor |first1=Robert A. |last2=Phelan |first2=Patrick E. |last3=Adrian |first3=Ronald J. |last4=Gunawan |first4=Andrey |last5=Otanicar |first5=Todd P. |journal=International Journal of Thermal Sciences |volume=56 |pages=1–11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.3571565 |title=Applicability of nanofluids in high flux solar collectors |year=2011 |last1=Taylor |first1=Robert A. |last2=Phelan |first2=Patrick E. |last3=Otanicar |first3=Todd P. |last4=Walker |first4=Chad A. |last5=Nguyen |first5=Monica |last6=Trimble |first6=Steven |last7=Prasher |first7=Ravi |journal=Journal of Renewable and Sustainable Energy |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=023104}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1063/1.3250174 |title=Vapor generation in a nanoparticle liquid suspension using a focused, continuous laser |year=2009 |last1=Taylor |first1=Robert A. |last2=Phelan |first2=Patrick E. |last3=Otanicar |first3=Todd |last4=Adrian |first4=Ronald J. |last5=Prasher |first5=Ravi S. |journal=Applied Physics Letters |volume=95 |issue=16 |pages=161907 |bibcode=2009ApPhL..95p1907T|url=https://works.bepress.com/todd_otanicar/1/download/ }}&lt;/ref&gt; Water vapor that includes water droplets is described as ''wet steam''. As wet steam is heated further, the droplets evaporate, and at a high enough temperature (which depends on the pressure) all of the water evaporates and the system is in [[vapor–liquid equilibrium]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Singh |first=R Paul |year=2001 |title=Introduction to Food Engineering |publisher=Academic Press |isbn=978-0-12-646384-2}}{{page needed|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Superheated steam]] is steam at a temperature higher than its [[boiling point]] for the pressure, which only occurs where all liquid water has evaporated or has been removed from the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.spiraxsarco.com/resources/steam-engineering-tutorials/steam-engineering-principles-and-heat-transfer/superheated-steam.asp |title=Superheated Steam |publisher=[[Spirax-Sarco Engineering]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Additionally, thermodynamic [[phase diagram]]s for water/steam, such as a temperature-entropy diagram or a [[Mollier diagram]] shown in this article, may be useful. Steam charts are also used for analysing thermodynamic cycles.

==Uses==

===Agricultural===
In [[agriculture]], steam is used for [[soil steam sterilization|soil sterilization]] to avoid the use of harmful chemical agents and increase [[soil health]]. 

===Domestic===
Steam's capacity to transfer heat is also used in the home: for cooking vegetables, steam cleaning of fabric, carpets and flooring, and for heating buildings.  In each case, water is heated in a boiler, and the steam carries the energy to a target object. Steam is also used in ironing clothes to add enough humidity with the heat to take wrinkles out and put intentional creases into the clothing. 

===Electricity generation (and cogeneration)===
About 90% of all electricity is [[Electricity generation|generated]] using steam as the [[working fluid]], nearly all by [[steam turbine]]s.&lt;ref Name="Wiser"&gt;{{cite book |title=Energy resources: occurrence, production, conversion, use |last=Wiser |first=Wendell H. |year=2000 |publisher=Birkhäuser |isbn=978-0-387-98744-6 |chapter=Energy Source Contributions to Electric Power Generation |page=190 |chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=UmMx9ixu90kC&amp;pg=PA190}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In electric generation, steam is typically condensed at the end of its expansion cycle, and returned to the boiler for re-use.  However, in [[cogeneration]], steam is piped into buildings through a [[district heating]] system to provide heat energy after its use in the electric generation cycle.  The world's biggest steam generation system is the [[New York City steam system]], which pumps steam into 100,000 buildings in [[Manhattan]] from seven cogeneration plants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Carl |last=Bevelhymer |url=http://www.gothamgazette.com/article/issueoftheweek/20031110/200/674 |title=Steam |website=[[Gotham Gazette]] |date=November 10, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Energy storage===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}
[[File:Dampfspeicherlok Genthin Henkel Werk.jpg|thumb|[[Fireless locomotive#Steam|Fireless steam locomotive]]&lt;br&gt;Despite the resemblance to a boiler, note the lack of a chimney and also how the cylinders are at the cab end, not the chimney end.]]
In other industrial applications steam is used for [[energy storage]], which is introduced and extracted by heat transfer, usually through pipes. Steam is a capacious reservoir for thermal energy because of water's high [[heat of vaporization]].

[[Fireless locomotive#Steam|Fireless steam locomotive]]s were [[steam locomotive]]s that operated from a supply of steam stored on board in a large tank resembling a conventional locomotive's boiler. This tank was filled by [[process steam]], as is available in many sorts of large factory, such as [[paper mill]]s. The locomotive's propulsion used pistons and connecting rods, as for a typical steam locomotive. These locomotives were mostly used in places where there was a risk of fire from a boiler's firebox, but were also used in factories that simply had a plentiful supply of steam to spare.

===Lifting gas===
Owing to its low molecular mass, steam is an effective [[lifting gas]], providing approximately 60% as much lift as helium and twice as much as hot air.  It is not flammable, unlike hydrogen, and is cheap and abundant, unlike helium.  The required heat, however, leads to condensation problems and requires an insulated envelope.  These factors have limited its use thus far to mostly demonstration projects.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.flyingkettle.com/jbfa.htm |title=Steam Balloon JBFA Article}}{{self-published inline|date=September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mechanical effort===
{{Unreferenced section|date=September 2013}}
[[Steam engine]]s and [[steam turbines]] use the expansion of steam to drive a [[piston]] or [[turbine]] to perform [[mechanical work]]. The ability to return condensed steam as water-liquid to the boiler at high pressure with relatively little expenditure of pumping power is  important. [[Condensation]] of steam to water often occurs at the low-pressure end of a steam turbine, since this maximizes the [[Energy conversion efficiency|energy efficiency]], but such wet-steam conditions must be limited to avoid excessive turbine blade erosion. Engineers use an idealised [[thermodynamic cycle]], the [[Rankine cycle]], to model the behavior of steam engines. Steam turbines are often used in the production of electricity.

===Sterilization===
An [[autoclave]], which uses steam under pressure, is used in microbiology laboratories and similar environments for [[Sterilization (microbiology)|sterilization]].

Steam, especially dry (highly superheated) steam, may be used for antimicrobial cleaning even to the levels of sterilization.  Steam is a non-toxic antimicrobial agent.&lt;ref&gt;EP Patent Publication 2,091,572&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1016/j.ajic.2011.11.013 |title=Biofilms on environmental surfaces: Evaluation of the disinfection efficacy of a novel steam vapor system |year=2012 |last1=Song |first1=Liyan |last2=Wu |first2=Jianfeng |last3=Xi |first3=Chuanwu |journal=American Journal of Infection Control |volume=40 |issue=10 |pages=926–30 |pmid=22418602}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Steam in piping===
Steam is used in [[piping]] for utility lines. It is also used in jacketing and tracing of piping to maintain the uniform temperature in pipelines and vessels.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Wood treatment===
Steam is used in the process of wood bending, killing insects and increasing plasticity.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

===Concrete treatment===
Steam is used to accentuate drying especially in prefabricates.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}
Care should be taken since concrete produces heat during hydration and additional heat from the steam could be detrimental to hardening reaction processes of the concrete.{{citation needed|date=September 2013}}

=== Cleaning ===
Used in cleaning of fibers and other materials, sometimes in preparation for painting. Steam is also useful in melting hardened grease and oil residues, so it is useful in cleaning kitchen floors and equipment and internal combustion engines and parts. Among the advantages of using steam versus a hot water spray are the facts that steam can operate at higher temperatures and it uses substantially less water per minute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Why Steam?|url=http://www.sioux.com/why-steam.html|website=Sioux Corporation Website|publisher=Sioux Corporation|accessdate=24 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Stone skimming -Patagonia-9Mar2010.jpg|thumb|upright=1.4|A stone skipping on calm water]]
'''Stone skipping''' (or '''stone skimming''') is the art of [[throwing]] a flat [[Rock (geology)|stone]] across water in such a way (usually [[Sidearm]]) that it bounces off the surface, preferably many times. The objective of the game is to see how many times a stone can bounce before sinking.

==Championships and records==
The North American Stone Skipping Association (NASSA), founded by Coleman-McGhee, in 1989 and is based in [[Driftwood, Texas]], sanctioned world championships for four years from 1989 through 1992{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}} in Wimberley, Texas. The next official NASSA World Championships is expected to be held at Platja d'en Ros beach in [[Cadaqués]], [[Catalonia]], [[Spain]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2007}}

The world record for the number of skips ''[[Guinness Book of Records]]'' is  88 by Kurt "Mountain Man" Steiner, (b. 1965). The cast was achieved on September 6, 2013 at Red Bridge in the Allegheny National Forest, Pennsylvania.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.guinnessworldrecords.com/world-records/1/most-skips-of-a-skimming-stone|title=Most skips of a skimming stone|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The previous record was 65 skips, by Max Steiner (no relation to K. Steiner), set at Riverfront Park, Franklin, Pennsylvania.

==Scientific explanation==
[[File:Skipping stones.svg|thumb|444px|Stone skipping]]
An early explanation of the physics of stone-skipping was provided by [[Lazzaro Spallanzani]] in the 18th century.

The stone generates lift in the same manner as a [[flying disc]], by pushing water down as it moves across the water at an angle. Surface tension has very little to do with it. The stone's rotation acts to stabilize it against the torque of lift being applied to the back.

Research undertaken by a team led by [[France|French]] [[physicist]] Lydéric Bocquet discovered that an angle of about 20° between the stone and the water's surface is optimal.&lt;ref name=pmid14702075&gt;{{cite journal |vauthors=Clanet C, Hersen F, Bocquet L |title=Secrets of successful stone-skipping |journal=Nature |volume=427 |issue=6969 |pages=29 |date=January 2004 |pmid=14702075 |doi=10.1038/427029a}}&lt;/ref&gt; Bocquet and his colleagues were surprised to discover that changes in [[speed]] and [[rotation]] did not change this fact, it just allow the stone to be in balance and to continue with a straight and uniform movement, due to gyroscopic effect.&lt;ref name=pmid14702075/&gt; Work by Hewitt, Balmforth and McElwaine has shown that if the horizontal speed can be maintained skipping can continue indefinitely.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author1=I.

Fluid Mech. | volume=669  | pages=328–353 | year=2011 | doi=10.1017/S0022112010005057}}&lt;/ref&gt; Earlier research reported by Bocquet calculated that the world record of 38 rebounds set by Coleman-McGhee, unchallenged for many years, required a speed of 12&amp;nbsp;m/s (25&amp;nbsp;mph), with a rotation of 14 [[Turn (geometry)|revolution]]s per second.&lt;ref name=pmid14702075/&gt;

A '''strain insulator''' is an [[electrical insulator]] that is designed to work in mechanical [[tension (physics)|tension]] (strain), to withstand the pull of a suspended electrical wire or cable.  They are used in overhead electrical wiring, to support [[radio]] [[antenna (radio)|antenna]]s and [[overhead power line]]s.    A strain insulator may be inserted between two lengths of wire to isolate them electrically from each other while maintaining a mechanical connection, or where a wire attaches to a pole or tower, to transmit the pull of the wire to the support while insulating it electrically.  Strain insulators were first used in [[telegraph]] systems in the mid 19th century.

==Description and use==
A typical strain insulator is a piece of [[glass]], [[porcelain]], or [[fiberglass]] that is shaped to accommodate two cables or a cable shoe and the supporting hardware on the support structure (hook eye, or eyelet on a steel pole/tower). The shape of the insulator maximizes the distance between the cables while also maximizing the load-bearing transfer capacity of the insulator. 

In practice, for [[radio antenna]]s, [[guy-wire]]s, [[overhead power line]]s and most other loads, the strain insulator is usually in physical [[tension (mechanics)|tension]].&lt;ref name="sediver"&gt;http://www.insulators.info/pictures/?id=137758928 Sediver deadend insulators @ 40000# and 30000# [Suspensions]&lt;/ref&gt;

When the line [[voltage]] requires more insulation than a single insulator can supply, strain insulators are used in series: A set of insulators are connected to each other using special hardware. The series can support the same strain as a single insulator, but the series provides a much higher effective insulation.

If one string is insufficient for the strain, a heavy steel plate effectively bundles several insulator strings mechanically. One plate is on the "hot" end and another is located at the support structure. This setup is almost universally used on long spans, such as when a power line crosses a river, canyon, lake, or other terrain requiring a longer than nominal span.&lt;ref&gt;http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/iel5/11056/34941/01668662.pdf Use of Factory-Formed Dead-Ends On High Temperature Conductors&lt;/ref&gt;

Strain insulators are typically used outdoors in overhead wiring. In this environment they are exposed to rain and, in urban settings, pollution. As a practical matter, the shape of the insulator becomes critically important, since a wetted path from one cable to the other can create a low-resistance electrical path.

Strain insulators intended for horizontal mounting (often referred to as "dead ends") therefore incorporate flanges to shed water, and strain insulators intended for vertical mounting (referred to as "suspension insulators") are often bell-shaped.&lt;ref name="sediver"/&gt;

The '''sweet potato''' (''Ipomoea batatas'') is a [[dicotyledon]]ous plant that belongs to the bindweed or morning glory [[Family (biology)|family]], [[Convolvulaceae]]. Its large, [[starch]]y, sweet-tasting, [[tuberous root]]s are a [[root vegetable]].&lt;ref name="Purseglove, 1991"&gt;{{cite book |last=Purseglove |first=John Williams |year=1968 |title=Tropical crops: Dicotyledons |series=Longman Scientific and Technical |publisher=John Wiley and Sons |publication-place=New York |url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Tropical_Crops.html?id=rYQ_AAAAYAAJ |isbn=978-0-582-46666-1}}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Woolfe, 1992"&gt;{{cite book |last=Woolfe |first=Jennifer A. |title=Sweet Potato: An untapped food resource |date=5 March 1992 |publication-place=Cambridge, UK |publisher=Cambridge University Press and the International Potato Center (CIP) |isbn=9780521402958}}&lt;/ref&gt; The young leaves and shoots are sometimes eaten as [[Leaf vegetable|greens]]. The sweet potato is only distantly related to the [[potato]] (''Solanum tuberosum'') and does not belong to the [[nightshade]] family, [[Solanaceae]], but both families belong to the same taxonomic order, the [[Solanales]].

The plant is a [[herbaceous plant|herbaceous]] [[perennial plant|perennial]] [[vine]], bearing alternate heart-shaped or palmately lobed [[Leaf|leaves]] and medium-sized [[sympetalous]] [[flower]]s. The edible tuberous root is long and tapered, with a smooth skin whose color ranges between yellow, orange, red, brown, purple, and beige. Its flesh ranges from beige through white, red, pink, violet, yellow, orange, and purple. Sweet potato [[cultivar]]s with white or pale yellow flesh are less sweet and moist than those with red, pink or orange flesh.&lt;ref name="loeb2009" /&gt;

''Ipomoea batatas'' is native to the tropical regions in the Americas.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/duke_energy/ipomoea_batatas.html |title=Ipomoea batatas |work=purdue.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://bioweb.uwlax.edu/bio203/2011/keesler_cole/classification.htm |title=Sweet Potato (Ipomoea batatas) Classification |work=uwlax.edu}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of the approximately 50&amp;nbsp;[[Convolvulaceae#Genera|genera]] and more than 1,000&amp;nbsp;species of Convolvulaceae, ''I. batatas'' is the only crop plant of major importance—some others are used locally (e.g., [[Ipomoea aquatica|''I. aquatica'']] "kangkong"), but many are poisonous. The genus ''Ipomoea'' that contains the sweet potato also includes several garden flowers called [[morning glory|morning glories]], though that term is not usually extended to ''Ipomoea batatas''. Some [[cultivar]]s of ''Ipomoea batatas'' are grown as [[ornamental plant]]s under the name ''tuberous morning glory,'' used in a [[horticultural]] context.

The sweet potato is often called a "yam" in parts of North America, but is botanically very distinct from the botanical [[yam (vegetable)|yam]]s.

==Naming==
{{See also|List of sweet potato cultivars}}
Although the soft, orange sweet potato is often called a ''"[[wikt:yam|yam]]"'' in parts of North America, the sweet potato is very distinct from the botanical [[yam (vegetable)|yam]]s (''Dioscorea''), which is native to Africa and Asia and belongs to the [[monocot]] family [[Dioscoreaceae]]. To add to the confusion, a different crop plant, the ''oca'' (''[[Oxalis tuberosa]]'', a species of wood sorrel), is called a "yam" in many parts of [[Polynesia]], including New Zealand.

Although the sweet potato is not closely related botanically to the common [[potato]], they have a shared etymology. The first Europeans to taste sweet potatoes were members of [[Christopher Columbus]]'s expedition in 1492. Later explorers found many cultivars under an assortment of local names, but the name which stayed was the indigenous [[Taíno people|Taino]] name of ''[[wikt:batata|batata]]''. The Spanish combined this with the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] word for potato, ''papa'', to create the word ''patata'' for the common potato.

In [[Argentina]], [[Venezuela]], [[Puerto Rico]] and the [[Dominican Republic]] the sweet potato is called ''batata''. In [[Mexico]], [[Peru]], [[Chile]], [[Central America]], and the [[Philippines]], the sweet potato is known as ''camote'' (alternatively spelled ''kamote'' in the Philippines), derived from the [[Nahuatl]] word ''camotli''.&lt;ref name="kamotenahuatl"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://elgaleon.weebly.com/page-18.html |title=Nahuatl influences in Tagalog |newspaper=El Galéon de Acapulco News |publisher=Embajada de México, Filipinas |accessdate=16 February 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130427213956/http://elgaleon.weebly.com/page-18.html |archivedate=27 April 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Peru, the [[Quechua languages|Quechua]] name for a type of sweet potato is ''kumar'', strikingly similar to the Polynesian name ''kumara'' and its regional Oceanic cognates (''kumala'', ''umala'', ''&amp;nbsp;'uala'', etc.), which has led some scholars to suspect an instance of [[Pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact#Linguistics|pre-Columbian trans-oceanic contact]].

In [[New Zealand]], the most common cultivar is the red (purple) cultivar called ''kumara'' (now spelled ''kūmara'' in the [[Māori language]]), but orange ('Beauregard') and gold cultivars are also available.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Yen |first=D. E. |journal=Economic Botany |volume=17 |number=1 |year=1963 |pages=31–45 |title=The New Zealand Kumara or Sweet Potato |jstor=4252401 |doi=10.1007/bf02985351}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kumara is particularly popular as a roasted food, often served with [[sour cream]] and [[sweet chili sauce]]. Occasionally, shops in Australia will label purple cultivars as "purple sweet potato" to denote the difference to the other cultivars. About 95% of Australia's production is of the orange cultivar named 'Beauregard', originally from North America, known simply as "sweet potato". A reddish-purple cultivar, 'Northern Star', is 4% of production and is sold as "kumara".

The sweet potato was grown in [[Polynesia]] before western exploration, and  the sweet potato cultivated in Polynesia is the ''Ipomoea batatas'', which is generally spread by vine cuttings rather than by seeds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/economicbotany/Ipomoea/index.html |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080519142258/http://www.botgard.ucla.edu/html/botanytextbooks/economicbotany/Ipomoea/index.html |archivedate=19 May 2008 |title=Batatas, Not Potatoes |publisher=Botgard.ucla.edu |accessdate=12 September 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweet potato has been [[Radiocarbon dating|radiocarbon-dated]] in the [[Cook Islands]] to 1000&amp;nbsp;CE.

Recent divergence time estimates suggest that sweet potatoes were already present in Polynesia thousands of years before humans arrived there. Additionally, there is evidence of long-distance dispersal of other species of ''Ipomoea'' from North America to [[Hawaii]]. This suggests natural long-distance dispersal of ''Ipomoea batatas'' is possible; that appears to be the simplest explanation for its presence in Polynesia: That the sweet potato arrived in the west Pacific naturally, rather than being carried there by humans.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Sweet potato history casts doubt on early contact between Polynesia and the Americas |url=https://www.eurekalert.org/pub_releases/2018-04/cp-sph040518.php |accessdate=23 September 2018 |publisher=EurekaAlert!

===Dispersal in historical times===
In response to a major crop failure, sweet potatoes were introduced to [[Fujian]] province of China in about 1594 from [[Luzon]]. The growing of sweet potatoes was encouraged by the Governor Chin Hsüeh-tseng (Jin Xuezeng).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Chinese Roundabout: Essays in History and Culture |first=Jonathan D. |last=Spence |edition=illustrated, reprint, revised |year=1993 |page=167 |publisher=W.

The sweet potato was introduced to [[Okinawa]], Japan in the early 1600s.&lt;ref name="Japan&amp;Dutch"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Goodman, Grant K. |title=Japan and the Dutch 1600-1853 |year=2013 |pages=66-67 |doi=10.4324/9781315028064}}{{full citation|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FirstGlobalization&gt;{{cite journal |author=Gunn, Geoffrey C. |title=First Globalization: The Eurasian Exchange, 1500-1800 |year=2003 |page=69 |doi=10.2307/20477565}}{{full citation|date=November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ObrienSweetPotato&gt;{{cite journal |author=Obrien, Patricia J. |title=The sweet potato: Its origin and dispersal |journal=American Anthropologist |volume=74 |issue=3 |year=1972 |pages=342-365 |doi=10.1525/aa.1972.74.3.02a00070}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweet potatoes became a staple in Japan because they were important in preventing famine when rice harvests were poor.&lt;ref name=ObrienSweetPotato/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |author=Itoh, Makiko |title=The storied history of the potato in Japanese cooking |newspaper=The Japan Times |date=April 22, 2017 |access-date=April 5, 2018 |url=https://www.japantimes.co.jp/life/2017/04/22/food/storied-history-potato-japanese-cooking/#.WsaQ6ojwaUk |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweet potatoes were later planted in Shōgun [[Tokugawa Yoshimune]]'s private garden.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Takekoshi, Yosaburō |year=1930 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ZoV8ti9RZBgC&amp;pg=PA352&amp;lpg=PA352&amp;dq= |title=Economic Aspects of the History of the Civilization of Japan |page=352}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was also introduced to [[Korea]] in 1764.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=Kim, Jinwung |year=2012 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=QFPsi3IK8gcC&amp;pg=PA255&amp;dq= |title=A History of Korea: From 'Land of the Morning Calm' to states in conflict |page=255}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The sweet potato arrived in Europe with the [[Columbian Exchange]]. It is recorded, for example, in ''[[Elinor Fettiplace's Receipt Book]]'', compiled in England in 1604.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Fettiplace |first1=Elinor |editor1-last=Spurling |editor1-first=Hilary |editor1-link=Hilary Spurling |title=Elinor Fettiplace's Receipt Book: Elizabethan Country House Cooking |date=1986 |origyear=1604 |publisher=Viking}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=CDW149&gt;Dickson Wright, 2011. Pages 149–169&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transgenicity===
The genome of cultivated sweet potatoes contains sequences of [[DNA]] from ''[[Agrobacterium]]'', with genes actively expressed by the plants. [[Transgene]]s were observed both in the sweet potato's closely related wild relatives, and in more distantly related wild species. This observation makes cultivated sweet potatoes the first known example of a naturally [[transgenic food crop]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Kyndt |first1=Tina |last2=Quispea |first2=Dora |last3=Zhaic |first3=Hong |last4=Jarretd |first4=Robert |last5=Ghislainb |first5=Marc |last6=Liuc |first6=Qingchang |last7=Gheysena |first7=Godelieve |last8=Kreuzeb |first8=Jan F. |title=The genome of cultivated sweet potato contains Agrobacterium T-DNAs with expressed genes: An example of a naturally transgenic food crop |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |date=20 April 2015 |doi=10.1073/pnas.1419685112 |volume=112 |pages=5844–5849 |pmid=25902487 |pmc=4426443}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Sweet potato is a natural GMO |url=http://www.genengnews.com/gen-news-highlights/sweet-potato-is-a-natural-gmo/81251182/|website=genengnews.com |publisher=Mary Ann Liebert |accessdate=23 April 2015 |date=22 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The plant does not tolerate [[frost]]. It grows best at an average [[temperature]] of {{convert|24|°C|°F|0|abbr=on}}, abundant sunshine and warm nights. Annual rainfalls of {{convert|750|-|1000|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} are considered most suitable, with a minimum of {{convert|500|mm|in|0|abbr=on}} in the growing season. The crop is sensitive to drought at the tuber initiation stage 50–60&amp;nbsp;days after planting, and it is not tolerant to water-logging, as it may cause tuber rots and reduce growth of storage roots if aeration is poor.&lt;ref name=Ahn1993&gt;{{cite book |last=Ahn |first=Peter |year=1993 |title=Tropical soils and fertilizer use |series=Intermediate Tropical Agriculture Series |publisher=Longman Scientific and Technical Ltd. |publication-place=UK |isbn=0-582-77507-8}}{{page needed|date=April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Depending on the cultivar and conditions, tuberous roots mature in two to nine months. With care, early-maturing cultivars can be grown as an [[Annual plant|annual]] summer crop in [[temperate climate|temperate]] areas, such as the northern [[United States]] and [[China]]. Sweet potatoes rarely [[flower]] when the daylight is longer than 11&amp;nbsp;hours, as is normal outside of the [[tropics]]. They are mostly propagated by stem or root cuttings or by adventitious shoots called "slips" that grow out from the tuberous roots during storage. True seeds are used for breeding only.

They grow well in many farming conditions and have few natural enemies; pesticides are rarely needed. Sweet potatoes are grown on a variety of soils, but well-drained, light- and medium-textured soils with a pH range of 4.5–7.0 are more favorable for the plant.&lt;ref name="Woolfe, 1992"/&gt; They can be grown in poor soils with little fertilizer. However, sweet potatoes are very sensitive to aluminum toxicity and will die about six weeks after planting if lime is not applied at planting in this type of soil.&lt;ref name="Woolfe, 1992"/&gt; Because they are sown by vine cuttings rather than seeds, sweet potatoes are relatively easy to plant. Because the rapidly growing vines shade out weeds, little weeding is needed. A commonly used herbicide to rid the soil of any unwelcome plants that may interfere with growth is [[Dimethyl tetrachloroterephthalate|DCPA]], also known as Dacthal. In the tropics, the crop can be maintained in the ground and harvested as needed for market or home consumption. In temperate regions, sweet potatoes are most often grown on larger farms and are harvested before first frosts.

In the Southeastern United States, sweet potatoes are traditionally cured to improve [[Sweet potato storage|storage]], flavor, and nutrition, and to allow wounds on the periderm of the harvested root to heal.&lt;ref name="ncsweetpotatoes.com"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ncsweetpotatoes.com/ |title=Sweet potatoes |publisher=North Carolina Sweet Potato Commission (NCSPC)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proper curing requires drying the freshly dug roots on the ground for two to three hours, then storage at {{convert|85|-|90|°F|°C|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} with 90 to 95% [[relative humidity]] from five to fourteen days. Cured sweet potatoes can keep for thirteen months when stored at {{convert|55|-|59|°F|°C|0|abbr=on|order=flip}} with &gt;90% relative humidity. Colder temperatures injure the roots.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://attra.ncat.org/attra-pub/sweetpotato.html |title=Sweetpotato: Organic Production |publisher=National Sustainable Agriculture Information Service}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://postharvest.ucdavis.edu/Produce/ProduceFacts/Veg/sweetpotato.shtml |title=Sweet potato |series=Produce Facts |publisher=UC Davis |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101105211935/http://postharvest.ucdavis.edu/Produce/ProduceFacts/Veg/sweetpotato.shtml |archive-date=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, global production of sweet potatoes was 105&amp;nbsp;million [[tonnes]], led by [[China]] with 67% of the world total (table).

In 2016, the world average annual yield for sweet potato crop was 13&amp;nbsp;tonnes per hectare. The most productive yield of sweet potatoes was in [[Senegal]], where the nationwide average annual yield was 39&amp;nbsp;tonnes per hectare.&lt;ref name=faostat16/&gt;

Sweet potatoes are cultivated throughout tropical and warm temperate regions wherever there is sufficient water to support their growth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=http://www.hort.purdue.edu/newcrop/proceedings1990/V1-424.html |contribution=Tropical root and tuber crops |author=O'Hair, Stephen K. |editor1=Janick, J. |editor2=Simon, J.E. |title=Advances in New Crops |publisher=Timber Press |location=Portland, OR |pages=424–428 |date=1990 |accessdate=26 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweet potatoes became common as a food crop in the [[Oceania|islands of the Pacific Ocean]], South India, [[Uganda]] and other African countries.

A [[cultivar]] of the sweet potato called the ''boniato'' is grown in the [[Caribbean]]; its flesh is cream-colored, unlike the more common orange hue seen in other cultivars. ''Boniatos'' are not as sweet and moist as other sweet potatoes, but their consistency and delicate flavor are different than the common orange-colored sweet potato.

Sweet potatoes have been a part of the diet in the United States for most of its history, especially in the Southeast.

Sweet potato cultivars with dark orange flesh have more beta-carotene than those with light-colored flesh, and their increased cultivation is being encouraged in Africa where vitamin&amp;nbsp;A deficiency is a serious health problem. A 2012 study of 10,000&amp;nbsp;households in [[Uganda]] found that children eating beta-carotene enriched sweet potatoes suffered less vitamin A deficiency than those not consuming as much beta-carotene.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Coghlan, A. |date=17 August 2012 |url=https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21528784.200-nutrientboosted-foods-protect-against-blindness.html |title=Nutrient-boosted foods protect against blindness |publisher=New Scientist |department=Health |accessdate=20 August 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Comparison to other food staples===
The table below presents the relative performance of sweet potato (in column&amp;nbsp;'''{{ref label|reference_name_G|G|G}}''') to other [[staple food]]s. While sweet potato provides less edible energy and protein per unit weight than cereals, it has higher nutrient density than cereals.&lt;ref name="ipc1"&gt;{{cite web |title=Roots and tubers in the global food system: A vision statement to the year 2020 |authors=Scott, Best, Rosegrant, and Bokanga |year=2000 |publisher=International Potato Center, and others |isbn=92-9060-203-1 |url=http://www.cipotato.org/publications/pdf/002468.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a study by the [[United Nations]] [[Food and Agriculture Organization]], sweet potatoes are the most efficient staple food to grow in terms of farmland, yielding approximately 70,000&amp;nbsp;[[Kilocalorie|kcal]]/[[Hectare|ha]] [[day|d]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/t0207e/T0207E04.htm |title=Roots, tubers, plantains and bananas in human nutrition |publisher=[[Food and Agriculture Organization]] |accessdate=2017-10-29 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Inginyo'' is mixed with cassava flour and [[tamarind]] to make ''atapa''. People eat ''atapa'' with smoked fish cooked in peanut sauce or with dried [[cowpea]] leaves cooked in peanut sauce. ''Emukaru'' (earth-baked root) is eaten as a snack anytime and is mostly served with tea or with peanut sauce. Similar uses are also found in [[South Sudan]].

The young leaves and vine tips of sweet potato leaves are widely consumed as a vegetable in West African countries (Guinea, [[Sierra Leone]] and [[Liberia]], for example), as well as in northeastern Uganda, East Africa.&lt;ref name="Abidin, 2004"/&gt; According to FAO leaflet No. 13 - 1990, sweet potato leaves and shoots are a good source of vitamins A, C, and B&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; (riboflavin), and according to research done by A. Khachatryan, are an excellent source of [[lutein]].

In [[Kenya]], Rhoda Nungo of the home economics department of the Ministry of Agriculture has written a guide to using sweet potatoes in modern recipes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Nutritious Kenyan Sweet Potato Recipes |editor=Nungo, Rhoda A. |publisher=KARi |location=Kakamega, Kenya |year=1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; This includes uses both in the mashed form and as flour from the dried tubers to replace part of the wheat flour and sugar in baked products such as cakes, chapatis, mandazis, bread, buns and cookies. A nutritious juice drink is made from the orange-fleshed cultivars, and deep-fried snacks are also included.

In [[Egypt]], sweet potato tubers are known as "batata" (بطاطا) and are a common street food in winter, when street vendors with carts fitted with ovens sell them to people passing time by the [[Nile]] or the sea. The cultivars used are an orange-fleshed one as well as a white/cream-fleshed one. They are also baked at home as a snack or dessert, drenched with [[honey]].

In [[Ethiopia]], the commonly found cultivars are black-skinned, cream-fleshed and called "bitatis" or "mitatis". They are cultivated in the eastern and southern lower highlands and harvested during the rainy season (June/July). In recent years, better yielding orange-fleshed cultivars were released for cultivation by [[Haramaya University]] as a less sugary sweet potato with higher vitamin&amp;nbsp;A content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=Tekalign |last1=Tsegaw |first2=Nigussie |last2=Dechassa |title=Registration of Adu and Barkume: Improved sweet potato (''Ipomoea batatas'') varieties for eastern Ethiopia |journal=East African Journal of Sciences |year=2008 |volume=2 |issue=2  |pages=189–191 |doi=10.4314/eajsci.v2i2.40382 |url=http://haramayajournals.org/index.php/ej/article/view/63/57}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweet potatoes are widely eaten boiled as a favored snack.

In East Asia, [[roasted sweet potato]]es are popular [[street food]]. In China, sweet potatoes, typically yellow cultivars, are baked in a large iron drum and sold as street food during winter. In Korea, sweet potatoes, known as ''{{Lang|ko|goguma}}'', are roasted in a drum can, baked in foil or on an open fire, typically during winter.
In Japan, a dish similar to the Korean preparation is called ''[[yaki-imo]]'' (roasted sweet potato), which typically uses either the yellow-fleshed "Japanese sweet potato" or the purple-fleshed "Okinawan sweet potato", which is known as ''beni-imo''.

[[Sweet potato soup]], served during winter, consists of boiling sweet potato in water with rock sugar and ginger. Sweet potato greens are a common side dish in [[Taiwanese cuisine]], often boiled or sautéed and served with a garlic and soy sauce mixture, or simply salted before serving. They, as well as dishes featuring the sweet potato root, are commonly found at [[bento]] ({{zh|poj=piān-tong}}) restaurants. In [[northeastern Chinese cuisine]], sweet potatoes are often cut into chunks and fried, before being drenched into a pan of boiling syrup.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ttmeishi.com/CaiPu/2c2ec442ae902a40.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071004141104/http://www.ttmeishi.com/CaiPu/2c2ec442ae902a40.htm |archive-date=2007-10-04 |title=CaiPu |language=Chinese |website=ttmeishi.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some regions of India, sweet potato is roasted slow over kitchen coals at night and eaten with some dressing while the easier way in the south is simply boiling or [[pressure cooking]] before peeling, cubing and seasoning for a vegetable dish as part of the meal. In Indian state of Tamil Nadu, it is known as 'Sakkara valli Kilangu'. It is boiled and consumed as evening snack. In some parts of India, fresh sweet potato is chipped, dried and then ground into flour; this is then mixed with wheat flour and baked into ''chapattis'' (bread). Between 15 and 20 percent of sweet potato harvest is converted by some Indian communities into pickles and snack chips. A part of the tuber harvest is used in India as cattle fodder.&lt;ref name=loeb2009&gt;{{cite book|title=The sweetpotato|author1=Gad Loebenstein |author2=George Thottappilly |year=2009|pages=391–425|isbn=978-1-4020-9475-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[Pakistan]], sweet potato is known as ''shakarqandi'' and is cooked as vegetable dish and also with meat dishes ([[Chicken as food|chicken]], [[mutton]] or [[beef]]). The ash roasted sweet potatoes are sold as a [[snack food|snack]] and [[street food]] in Pakistani [[bazaar]]s especially during the winter months.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.dawn.com/news/771928 |title=Exploiting sweet potato potential}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In Sri Lanka, it is called 'Bathala' and tubers are used mainly for breakfast (boiled sweet potato commonly with sambal or grated coconut) or as an supplementary curry dish for rice. There are many other culinary uses with sweet potato as well.

The tubers of this plant, known as ''kattala'' in [[Dhivehi language|Dhivehi]], have been used in the traditional diet of the [[Maldives]]. The leaves were finely chopped and used in dishes such as ''[[mas huni]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author-link=Xavier Romero-Frias |last=Romero-Frias |first=Xavier |year=1999 |title=The Maldive Islanders: A study of the popular culture of an ancient ocean kingdom |location=Barcelona, ES |ISBN=84-7254-801-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Japanese cuisine|In Japan]], both sweet potatoes (called "satsuma-imo") and true purple yams (called "daijo" or "beni-imo") are grown. Boiling and steaming are the most common cooking methods. Also, the use in vegetable [[tempura]] is common. ''Daigaku-imo'' is a baked sweet potato [[dessert]]. Because it is sweet and starchy, it is used in ''[[imo-kinton]]'' and some other [[wagashi|traditional sweets]], such as ''[[ofukuimo]]''.
''[[Shōchū]]'', a Japanese spirit normally made from the fermentation of [[rice]], can also be made from sweet potato, in which case it is called ''imo-jōchū''. ''Imo-[[rice|gohan]]'', sweet potato cooked with [[rice]], is popular in Guangdong, Taiwan and Japan. It is also served in ''[[nimono]]'' or ''[[nitsuke]]'', boiled and typically flavored with [[soy sauce]], ''[[mirin]]'' and ''[[dashi]]''.
In [[Korean cuisine]], sweet potato starch is used to produce ''dangmyeon'' ([[cellophane noodles]]). Sweet potatoes are also boiled, steamed, or roasted, and young stems are eaten as ''[[namul]]''. Pizza restaurants such as Pizza Hut and Domino's in Korea are using sweet potatoes as a popular topping. Sweet potatoes are also used in the distillation of a variety of Soju.

In [[Malaysia]] and [[Singapore]], sweet potato is often cut into small cubes and cooked with [[Colocasia esculenta|taro]] and coconut milk (''santan'') to make a sweet dessert called ''[[bubur caca]]'' or "[[bubu chacha]]". A favorite way of cooking sweet potato is deep frying slices of sweet potato in batter, and served as a tea-time snack. In homes, sweet potatoes are usually boiled. The leaves of sweet potatoes are usually stir-fried with only garlic or with ''sambal belacan'' and dried shrimp by Malaysians.

In the [[Philippines]], sweet potatoes (locally known as ''camote'' or ''kamote'') are an important food crop in rural areas. They are often a staple among impoverished families in provinces, as they are easier to cultivate and cost less than rice.&lt;ref name="manilatimes"/&gt; The tubers are boiled or baked in coals and may be dipped in sugar or syrup. Young leaves and shoots (locally known as ''talbos ng kamote'' or ''camote'' tops) are eaten fresh in salads with [[shrimp paste]] (''bagoong alamang'') or [[fish sauce]].

In [[Indonesia]], sweet potatoes are locally known as ''ubi jalar'' (lit: spreading tuber) and are frequently fried with batter and served as snacks with spicy condiments, along with other kinds of fritters such as fried bananas, tempeh, [[Tahu goreng|tahu]], breadfruits, or cassava. In the mountainous regions of [[West Papua (region)|West Papua]], sweet potatoes are the staple food among the natives there. Using the ''bakar batu'' way of cooking (free translation: burning rocks), rocks that have been burned in a nearby bonfire are thrown into a pit lined with leaves. Layers of sweet potatoes, an assortment of vegetables, and pork are piled on top of the rocks. The top of the pile then is insulated with more leaves, creating a pressure of heat and steam inside which cooks all food within the pile after several hours.

Young sweet potato leaves are also used as [[baby food]] particularly in [[Southeast Asia]] and [[East Asia]].&lt;ref name="faosweetpotato"&gt;{{cite book |department=South Pacific Commission |ID=Leaflet No. 13 |title=Sweet Potato |publisher=Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations |year=1990 |issn=1018-0966 |url=http://www.fao.org/wairdocs/x5425e/x5425e0d.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dost"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.fnri.dost.gov.ph/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=49 |title=10 Best Foods for Babies |author1=Ma, Idelia |author2=Glorioso, G. |date=January–December 2003 |department=Food and Nutrition Research Institute |publisher=Department of Science and Technology, Republic of the Philippines |accessdate=22 July 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130527133110/http://www.fnri.dost.gov.ph/index.php?option=content&amp;task=view&amp;id=49 |archivedate=27 May 2013 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mashed sweet potato tubers are used similarly throughout the world.&lt;ref name="emb"&gt;{{cite book |editor1=Ember, Carol R. |editor2=Ember, Melvin |title=Encyclopedia of Medical Anthropology |article=Cultures |publisher=Springer |year=2004 |page=596 |isbn=9780306477546 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=nrMRezmNrPcC&amp;lpg=PA596&amp;dq=sweet%20potato%20leaves%20baby%20food&amp;pg=PA596#v=onepage&amp;q=sweet%20potato%20leaves%20baby%20food&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The occasion is called ''La Castanyada''.&lt;ref&gt;[[:es:Castanyada#Castañada]]{{Better source|date=November 2018|reason=[[WP:CIRCULAR]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sweet potato is also appreciated to make cakes or to eat roasted through the whole country.

In [[Peru]], sweet potatoes are called 'camote' and are frequently served alongside [[ceviche]]. Sweet potato chips are also a commonly sold snack, be it on the street or in packaged foods.

[[Dulce de batata]] is a traditional [[Argentine cuisine|Argentine]], [[Paraguay]]an and [[Uruguay]]an [[dessert]], which is made of sweet potatoes. It is a sweet [[Fruit preserves|jelly]], which resembles a marmalade because of its color and sweetness but it has a harder texture, and it has to be sliced in thin portions with a knife as if it was a pie. It is commonly served with a portion of the same size of soft cheese on top of it.

In the [[Veneto]] ([[northeast Italy]]), sweet potato is known as ''patata mericana'' in the [[Venetian language]] (''patata americana'' in [[Italian language|Italian]], meaning "American potato"), and it is cultivated above all in the southern area of the region;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www2.regione.veneto.it/videoinf/rurale/prodotti/pat_americana.htm |series=Mondo agricolo veneto |title=la patata americana di Anguillara&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100112083605/http://www2.regione.veneto.it/videoinf/rurale/prodotti/pat_americana.htm |archive-date=12 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; it is a [[Venetian cuisine|traditional]] fall dish, boiled or roasted.

All parts of the plant are used for animal [[fodder]].

Several selections are cultivated in gardens as ornamental plants for their attractive foliage, including the dark-leafed cultivars 'Blackie' and 'Ace of Spades' and the chartreuse-foliaged 'Margarita'.

Cuttings of sweet potato vine, either edible or ornamental cultivars, will rapidly form roots in water and will grow in it, indefinitely, in good lighting with a steady supply of nutrients. For this reason, sweet potato vine is ideal for use in home [[aquarium]]s, trailing out of the water with its roots submerged, as its rapid growth is fueled by toxic [[ammonia]] and [[nitrates]], a waste product of aquatic life, which it removes from the water. This improves the living conditions for fish, which also find refuge in the extensive root systems.

Researchers at [[North Carolina State University]] are breeding sweet potato cultivars that would be grown primarily for [[biofuel]] production.

'''Tar paper''' is a heavy-duty [[paper]] used in [[construction]]. Tar paper is made by impregnating paper or fiberglass mat with [[tar]], producing a [[waterproof]] material useful for [[roof]] construction. Tar paper is distinguished from [[roofing felt]] which is impregnated with [[asphalt]] instead of tar; but these two products are used the same way, and their names sometimes are used informally as synonyms.

Tar paper has been in use for centuries. Originally felt was made from [[recycled]] rags but today felts are made of recycled paper products (typically cardboard) and sawdust. The most common product is #15 felt. Before the oil crisis, felt weighed about 15 pounds per square (one square = 100 square feet) and hence the asphalt-impregnated felt was called "15#" and "15-pound felt". Modern, inorganic mats no longer weigh 0.73&amp;nbsp;kg/m2, and to reflect this fact the new felts are called "#15". In fact, #15 mats can weigh from 7.5 to 12.5 pounds/sq depending on the manufacturer and the standard to which felt is made (i.e., CGSB, ASTM D227 Standard Specification for Coal-tar saturated Organic Felt Used in Roofing and Waterproofing, ASTM D4990, Standard Specification for Coal Tar Glass Felt Used in Roofing and Waterproofing, or none). Thirty-pound (30#) felt is now #30 felt, and usually weighs 16 to 27 pounds per square.

Tar paper is more accurately a Grade D building paper (the Grade D designation derives from a federal specification in the United States), which is widely used in the West. Building paper is manufactured from virgin [[kraft paper]], unlike felts, and then impregnated with asphalt. The longer fibres in the kraft paper allow for a lighter weight product with similar and often better mechanical properties than felt. Grade papers are rated in minutes—the amount of time it takes for a moisture sensitive chemical indicator to change colour when a small boat-like sample is floated on water. Common grades include 10, 20, 30, and 60 minute. The higher the rating the more moisture resistant and the heavier. A typical 20 minute paper will weigh about 3.3&amp;nbsp;lbs per square, a 30-minute paper 3.75, and a 60-minute paper about six. The smaller volume of material however does tend to make these papers less resistant to moisture than heavier felts.{{citation needed|date=December 2013}}

==Uses==
[[Image:Roofing felt.jpg|thumb|300px|Workers using special "roofing [[shovels]]" to remove composite shingles as part of a roof repair. Roofing felt or tar paper is here used as underlay(ment) between the wooden sheathing and exterior shingles.]]

Tar paper is far less common than asphalt felt paper and is used, among other things, for [[waterproofing]] roofs to prevent ingress of moisture. It is used in a small percentage of built-up roofs (BUR), as [[Bituminous waterproofing|underlayment]] with [[Asphalt shingle|asphalt]], [[Wood shingle|wood]], [[Shake (shingle)|shake]], and other [[Roof shingle|shingles]], or even gravel, since tar paper itself isn't particularly wind- or sun-resistant. It is sold in rolls of various widths, lengths, and thicknesses&amp;nbsp;– {{convert|3|ft|m|adj=mid|-wide}} rolls, {{convert|50|or|100|ft}} long and "15 lb" ({{convert|15|lb|disp=output only|sigfig=1}}) and "30 lb" ({{convert|30|lb|disp=output only}}) weights are common in the U.S.&amp;nbsp;– often marked with chalk lines at certain intervals to aid in laying it out straight on roofs with the proper overlap (more overlap for flatter roofs).

It can be installed in several ways, such as staples or [[roofing nail]]s, but it is also sometimes applied in several layers with hot asphalt, cold [[asphalt]] (adhesive), or non-asphaltic adhesives.

Older construction sometimes used a lighter-weight tar paper, stapled up with some overlap, as a water- and wind-proofing material on walls, but modern carpenters more often uses {{convert|8|or|10|ft|m|adj=on}} widths of "[[housewrap]]".

The '''ton''' is a [[unit of measurement|unit of measure]]. It has a long history and has acquired a number of meanings and uses over the years. It is used principally as a unit of mass. Its original use as a measurement of volume has continued in the capacity of cargo ships and in terms such as the freight ton. It can also be used as a measure of energy, for truck classification, or as a colloquial term.

It is derived from the ''[[Tun (volume)|tun]]'', the term applied to a cask of the largest capacity. This could contain a volume between {{convert|175|and|213|impgal|USgal l|lk=on}}, which could weigh around {{convert|2,000|lb|kg|lk=on}} and occupy some {{convert|60|cuft|m3|lk=on}} of space.&lt;ref name=BTS.GOV&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ntl.bts.gov/DOCS/narmain/narmain.html |title=Naval Architecture for All |publisher=United States Bureau of Transportation Statistics |accessdate=October 13, 2008 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081010071508/http://ntl.bts.gov/DOCS/narmain/narmain.html |archivedate=October 10, 2008 |df= }}. "Historically, a very important and standard cargo for European sailing vessels was wine, stored and shipped in casks called tuns. These tuns of wine, because of their uniform size and their universal demand, became a standard by which a ship's capacity could be measured. A tun of wine weighed approximately 2,240 pounds, and occupied nearly 60 cubic feet." ([[Thomas C. Gillmer|Gillmer, Thomas]] (1975). ''Modern Ship Design''. United States Naval Institute.) "Today the ship designers standard of weight is the long ton which is equal to 2,240 pounds." This is the weight of 35 cubic feet of Sea Water at a specific gravity of 1.025, compared to Fresh Water, specific gravity of 1.000 usually measured at 60 degrees F. Handy numbers: 35, 36, 37, number of Cubic Feet per Salt Water, Fresh Water and Lube Oil.&lt;/ref&gt; 

In the United Kingdom the ton is defined as 2,240 [[avoirdupois]] [[avoirdupois pound|pound]]s (1,016&amp;nbsp;kg).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url = http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1985/pdf/ukpga_19850072_en.pdf| title = Weights and Measures Act 1985| accessdate = 2010-02-03| date = 1985-10-30| publisher = Her Majesty's Stationery Office| deadurl = no| archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20091208083258/http://www.opsi.gov.uk/acts/acts1985/pdf/ukpga_19850072_en.pdf| archivedate = 2009-12-08| df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is equivalent to 20 [[hundredweight]], a hundredweight being eight [[Stone (unit)|stone]], and a stone weighing 14 pounds.  From 1965 the UK embarked upon a programme of [[Metrication in the United Kingdom|metrication]] and gradually introduced metric units, including the [[tonne]] (metric ton), defined as 1000&amp;nbsp;kg (2,204&amp;nbsp;lb). The UK [[Weights and Measures Act 1985]] explicitly excluded from use for trade many units and terms, including the ton and the term "metric ton" for "tonne".&lt;ref&gt;A Dictionary of Weights, Measures, and Units, edited by Donald Fenna, Oxford University Press&lt;/ref&gt;

In the United States and Canada&lt;ref name=Canada&gt;{{cite web|url=http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/W-6/page-10.html#docCont|title=Weights and Measures Act: Canadian units of measure, Schedule II (Section 4)|publisher=Department of Justice|accessdate=2011-07-06|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110811094412/http://laws-lois.justice.gc.ca/eng/acts/W-6/page-10.html#docCont|archivedate=2011-08-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a ton is defined to be {{convert|2000|lb|kg|0}}.

Where confusion is possible, the 2240&amp;nbsp;lb ton is called "[[long ton]]" and the 2000&amp;nbsp;lb ton "[[short ton]]"; the tonne is distinguished by its spelling, but usually pronounced the same as ton, hence the US term "metric ton". In the UK the final "e" of "tonne" can also be pronounced ({{IPAc-en|ˈ|t|ʌ|n|i}}),&lt;ref name="oedtonne"&gt;{{cite OED|tonne}}&lt;/ref&gt; or "metric ton" when it is necessary to make the distinction.

Where accuracy is required the correct term must be used, but for many purposes this is not necessary: the metric and long tons differ by only 1.6%, and the short ton is within 11% of both. The ton is the heaviest unit of weight referred to in colloquial speech.

The term "ton" is also  used to refer to a number of units of [[volume]], ranging from {{convert|35|to|100|cuft|m3|lk=on}} in capacity.

It can also be used as a unit of [[energy]], expressed as an equivalent of coal burnt or [[Trinitrotoluene|TNT]] detonated.

In refrigeration, a ton is a unit of [[Power (physics)|power]], sometimes called a ''[[ton of refrigeration]]''.  It is the power required to melt or freeze one short ton of ice per day.  The refrigeration ton hour is a unit of [[energy]], the energy required to melt or freeze {{frac|1|24}} short ton of ice.

===Others===

*The long ton is used for petroleum products such as [[aviation fuel]].
*'''Deadweight ton''' (abbreviation 'DWT' or 'dwt') is a measure of a ship's carrying capacity, including bunker oil, fresh water, ballast water, crew and provisions. It is expressed in tonnes (1000&amp;nbsp;kg) or long tons (2240 pounds, about 1016&amp;nbsp;kg). This measurement is also used in the U.S. tonnage of naval ships.
* Increasingly, [[tonne]]s are being used rather than long tons in measuring the displacement of ships. ''See'' [[tonnage]].
*'''Harbour ton''' used in South Africa in the 20th century, 2000 pounds or one short ton.

Both the long ton and the short ton are 20 [[hundredweight]], the long hundredweight and the short hundredweight being 112 and 100 pounds respectively. Before the twentieth century there were several definitions. Prior to the 15th century in England, the ton was 20&amp;nbsp;hundredweight, each of 108&amp;nbsp;lb, giving a ton of {{convert|2160|lb|kg}}.{{Citation needed|date=October 2009}}  In the nineteenth century in different parts of Britain, definitions of 2240, 2352, and 2400&amp;nbsp;lb were used, with 2000&amp;nbsp;lb for explosives; the legal ton was usually{{sic}} 2240&amp;nbsp;lb.&lt;ref&gt;Definitions of 2000, 2240, 2352, and 2400&amp;nbsp;lb are included in citations listed in the Oxford English Dictionary, 2nd ed. OED cites an 1858 dictionary of trade products "the legal ton by weight is usually 20 cwt".&lt;/ref&gt;

{{anchor|Assay ton}}
'''Assay ton''' (abbreviation 'AT') is not a unit of measurement, but a standard quantity used in [[assay]]ing ores of precious metals; it is {{frac|29|1|6}} grams (short assay ton) or {{frac|32|2|3}} grams (long assay ton), the amount which bears the same ratio to a milligram as a short or long ton bears to a [[troy ounce]]. In other words, the number of milligrams of a particular metal found in a sample of this size gives the number of troy ounces contained in a short or long ton of ore.

In documents that predate 1960 the word ''ton'' is sometimes spelled ''tonne'',{{fact|reason=No entry for tonne in SOED|date=June 2018}} but in more recent documents ''tonne'' refers exclusively to the [[metric ton]].

In [[nuclear power plant]]s '''tHM''' and '''MTHM''' mean tonnes of [[heavy metals]], and '''MTU''' means tonnes of [[uranium]]. In the [[steel]] industry, the abbreviation '''THM''' means 'tons/tonnes hot metal', which refers to the amount of liquid iron or steel that is produced, particularly in the context of [[blast furnace]] production or specific consumption.

A '''dry ton''' or '''dry tonne''' has the same mass value, but the material ([[sludge]], slurries, [[compost]], and similar mixtures in which solid material is soaked with or suspended in [[water]]) has been dried to a relatively low, consistent [[moisture]] level ([[dry weight]]). If the material is in its natural, wet state, it is called a '''wet ton''' or '''wet tonne'''.

==Units of volume==
{{See also|Tonnage}}
The [[Displacement (ship)|displacement]], essentially the weight, of a ship is traditionally expressed in [[long ton]]s. To simplify measurement it is determined by measuring the [[volume]], rather than weight, of water displaced, and calculating the weight from the volume and density.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=vylCkqTg7H0C&amp;pg=PA249 Displacement ton] Dictionary of international trade retrieved 22July2010&lt;/ref&gt;
For practical purposes the '''displacement ton''' (DT) is a unit of volume, {{convert|35|cuft|sigfig=4}}, the approximate volume occupied by one ton of [[seawater]] (the actual volume varies with salinity and temperature).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.oxfordreference.com/views/ENTRY.html?entry=t135.e351&amp;srn=1&amp;ssid=351170645#FIRSTHIT A Dictionary of Weights, Measures, and Units, Donald Fenna, 2002] {{ISBN|0-19-860522-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is slightly less than the 224 imperial gallons (1.018&amp;nbsp;m&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;) of the '''water ton''' (based on [[distilled water]]).

One '''measurement ton''' or '''freight ton''' is equal to {{convert|40|cuft|sigfig=4}}, but historically it has had several different definitions. It is sometimes abbreviated as "MTON".  It is used to determine the amount of money to be charged as "Freight" in carrying different sorts of cargo. In general if a cargo is heavier than salt water, the actual tonnage is used. If it is lighter than salt water, e.g. feathers, freight is calculated using Measurement Tons of 40 cubic feet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.msc.navy.mil/annualreport/2003/financial.htm |title=MSC 2003 in Review - Financial and Statistical Review |publisher=Msc.navy.mil |date=2003-09-30 |accessdate=2010-07-31 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110722195701/http://www.msc.navy.mil/annualreport/2003/financial.htm |archivedate=2011-07-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sddc.army.mil/EXTRACONTENT/billingrates/FY09%20Liner%20Breakbulk%20Definitions.doc Military Surface Deployment and Distribution Command]{{dead link|date=March 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}, 2009

In the past it has been used for a cargo ship but the register ton is now preferred. It is correctly abbreviated as "FT"{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} but some users are now using freight ton to represent a weight of {{convert|1|t|kg lb|0|lk=in}}, thus the more common abbreviations are now '''M/T''', '''MT''', or '''MTON''' (for measurement ton), which still cause it to be confused with the tonne, or even the [[megatonne]].

The '''register ton''' is a unit of volume used for the cargo capacity of a ship, defined as {{convert|100|cuft|m3|sigfig=4}}. It is often abbreviated '''RT''' or '''GRT''' for '''gross registered ton''' (The former providing confusion with the refrigeration ton). It is known as a ''tonneau de mer'' in Belgium, but, in France, a ''tonneau de mer'' is {{convert|1.44|m3|cuft|sigfig=4}}.

The '''Panama Canal/Universal Measurement System (PC/UMS)''' is based on [[net tonnage]], modified for Panama Canal billing purposes. PC/UMS is based on a mathematical formula to calculate a vessel's total volume; a '''PC/UMS net ton''' is equivalent to 100 cubic feet of capacity.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pancanal.com/eng/general/peajes-en-el-canal.html ''Panama Canal Tolls''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080916113752/http://www.pancanal.com/eng/general/peajes-en-el-canal.html |date=2008-09-16 }}, [[Panama Canal Authority]].

==Units of energy and power==

===Ton of TNT===
{{Main|TNT equivalent}}

*A '''ton of TNT''' or ''tonne of TNT'' is a unit of energy equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;9&lt;/sup&gt; (thermochemical) [[calorie]]s, also known as a gigacalorie (Gcal), equal to 4.184 [[gigajoule]]s (GJ).
*A '''kiloton of TNT''' or ''kilotonne of TNT'' is a unit of energy equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;12&lt;/sup&gt; calories, also known as a teracalorie (Tcal), equal to 4.184 terajoules (TJ).
*A '''megaton of TNT''' (1,000,000 metric tonnes) or ''megatonne of TNT'' is a unit of energy equal to 10&lt;sup&gt;15&lt;/sup&gt; calories, also known (infrequently) as a petacalorie (Pcal), equal to 4.184 petajoules (PJ).

Note that these are small calories (cal). The large or dietary calorie (Cal) is equal to one kilocalorie (kcal), and is gradually being replaced by the latter correct term.

Early values for the explosive energy released by [[trinitrotoluene]] (TNT) ranged from 900 to 1100 calories per gram. In order to standardise the use of the term ''TNT'' as a unit of energy, an arbitrary value was assigned based on 1000 calories ({{convert|1|kcal|3|abbr=on|disp=or|lk=out}}) per gram. Thus there is no longer a direct connection to the chemical TNT itself. It is now merely a unit of energy that happens to be expressed using words normally associated with mass (e.g., kilogram, tonne, pound).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.iaea.org/About/Policy/GC/GC42/Documents/gc42inf3.pdf|title=GC(42)/INF/3 - Measures to Strengthen Co-operation in Nuclear, Radiation and Waste Safety|author=|date=|website=iaea.org|accessdate=1 May 2018|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170711061722/https://www.iaea.org/About/Policy/GC/GC42/Documents/gc42inf3.pdf|archivedate=11 July 2017|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull404/article1.pdf Radioactive residues of the Cold War period] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051016232934/http://www.iaea.org/Publications/Magazines/Bulletin/Bull404/article1.pdf |date=2005-10-16 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The definition applies for both spellings: ''ton of TNT'' and ''tonne of TNT''.

Measurements in tons of TNT have been used primarily to express [[nuclear weapon yield]]s, though they have also been used since in [[seismology]] as well.

A [[tonne of oil equivalent]] (toe), sometimes ''ton of oil equivalent'', is a conventional value, based on the amount of energy released by burning one tonne of crude oil. The unit is used, for example, by the International Energy Agency (IEA), for the reported [[world energy consumption]] as [[TPES]] in millions of toe (Mtoe).&lt;ref name="IEA-Report-keyworld-2014"&gt;

=== Refrigeration ===
{{Main|Ton of refrigeration}}
The unit ''ton'' is used in [[refrigeration]] and [[Refrigeration ton|air conditioning]] to measure the rate of heat absorption. Prior to the introduction of mechanical refrigeration, cooling was accomplished by delivering ice.  Installing one [[ton of refrigeration|ton of mechanical refrigeration]] capacity replaced the daily delivery of one ton of ice.

* In North America, a '''standard ton of refrigeration''' is {{convert|12000|BTU/h|W|0|abbr=on|lk=on}}. "The [[heat absorption]] per day is approximately the [[heat of fusion]] of 1&amp;nbsp;''ton'' of ice at {{convert|32|°F}}."&lt;ref&gt;Marks' Standard handbook for Mechanical Engineers, 8th Ed., McGraw Hill, p. 19–3&lt;/ref&gt; This is approximately the power required to melt one short ton ({{convert|2000|lb|0|abbr=on|disp=or}}) of ice at {{convert|0|C|0|abbr=on}} in 24&amp;nbsp;hours, thus representing the delivery of {{convert|1|ST|LT t|3}} of ice per day.
* A less common usage is the power required to cool 1 long ton ({{convert|2240|lb|0|abbr=on|disp=or}} = {{convert|1|LT|ST t|3|abbr=on|disp=or}}) of water by {{convert|1|F-change}} every 10 minutes = {{convert|13,440|BTU/h|W|0|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title =ton (of refrigeration) | url =http://www.sizes.com/units/ton.htm | work =[http://www.sizes.com/ Sizes.com] | accessdate =2006-09-01 | deadurl =no | archiveurl =https://web.archive.org/web/20061020203121/http://www.sizes.com/units/ton.htm | archivedate =2006-10-20 | df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title=Measurements and Units | url=http://www.numericana.com/answer/units.htm#othertons | author=Gérard P.

A refrigeration ton should be regarded as power produced by a chiller when operating in standard [[Air Conditioning, Heating and Refrigeration Institute|AHRI]] conditions, which are typically {{convert|44|°F}} for chilled water unit, and {{convert|95|°F}} air entering the condenser. This is commonly referred to as "true ton". Manufacturers can also provide tables for chillers operating at other chilled water temperature conditions (as {{convert|65|°F|1|disp=or}}) which can show more favorable data, which are not valid when making performance comparisons among units unless conversion rates are applied.{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}

The refrigeration ton is commonly abbreviated as '''RT'''.

==Informal tons==
*'''Ton''' is also used informally, often as [[slang]], to mean a large amount of something, material or not.  For example, "I have a ton of homework to do this weekend."
*In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], a ton is colloquially used to refer to 100 of a given unit. Ton can thus refer to a speed of 100 miles per hour, and is prefixed by an indefinite article, e.g. "Lee was doing a ton down the motorway"; to money e.g. "How much did you pay for that?" "A ton" (£100); to 100 points in a game e.g. "Eric just threw a ton in our darts game" (in some games, e.g. [[cricket]], more commonly called a century); or to a hundred of any other countable figure.&lt;ref&gt;Colin R. Chapman, ''Weights, Money and Other Measures Used by our Ancestors'', p.93, Genealogical Publishing Com, 1996 {{ISBN|0-8063-1501-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;John MacRae-Hall, ''A Deniable Asset'', p.85, iUniverse, 2011 {{ISBN|1-4502-8078-1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford English Dictionary 2nd ed. lists colloquial use of "ton" from 1946 for £100, and later 100 mph, and for 100 in general.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Dutch language|Dutch]], when talking about money a ton is used to indicate [[100000 (number)|100,000]]. For example a house costing 2 ton would cost 200,000 euros.&lt;ref&gt;Bruce Donaldson, ''Dutch: A Comprehensive Grammar'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=aFN9AgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA357#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true page 357], Routledge, 2008 {{ISBN|1134082363}} .&lt;/ref&gt;  This convention has been in use since at least the 18th century.&lt;ref&gt;''A Description of Holland'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=UCYyAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA267#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=true page 267], J. and P. Knapton, 1743.&lt;/ref&gt;
*In [[Finnish language|Finnish]], ''tonni'' is often used as a synonym for one thousand ([[1000 (number)|1000]]), especially when referring to money. For example, "tonnin seteli" was a 1000 [[Finnish mark|mark]]'s [[banknote]] and a popular TV show was called "Kymppitonni" ("ten tons" = 10,000 marks).

'''Trimethylborane (TMB)''' is a toxic, [[Pyrophoricity|pyrophoric]] gas with the formula B(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; (which can also be written as Me&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;B, with Me representing [[methyl]]). 

==Properties==
As a liquid it is colourless. The strongest line in the [[infrared spectrum]] is at 1330&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; followed by lines at 3010&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt; and 1185&amp;nbsp;cm&lt;sup&gt;−1&lt;/sup&gt;.

Its melting point is −161.5&amp;nbsp;°C, and its boiling point is −20.2&amp;nbsp;°C.

Vapour pressure is given by {{nowrap|log ''P'' {{=}} 6.1385 + 1.75 log ''T'' − 1393.3/''T'' − 0.007735 ''T''}}, where ''T'' is temperature in [[kelvin]]s.&lt;ref name=IS/&gt;  Molecular weight is 55.914. The heat of vapourisation is 25.6&amp;nbsp;kJ/mol.&lt;ref name=cd&gt;[http://www.chemicaldictionary.org/dic/T/Trimethylborane_550.html Trimethylborane]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preparation==
Trimethylborane was first made by Stock and Zeidler.  Their method of preparation combined [[boron trichloride]] gas with [[dimethylzinc]].&lt;ref name=IS&gt;{{cite book|editor=Alvin P. Ginsberg|work=Inorganic Syntheses|volume=27|title=Trimethylborane|page=339|author=William S. Rees, Jr. and al|year=1990}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the substance can be prepared using [[Grignard reagents]] the output is contaminated by unwanted products from the solvent.  Trimethylborane can be made on a small scale with a 98% yield by reacting [[trimethylaluminium]] in [[hexane]] with [[boron tribromide]] in [[dibutyl ether]] as a solvent.&lt;ref name=IS/&gt;  Yet other methods are reacting [[tributyl borate]] with  trimethylaluminium chloride, or potassium tetrafluoroborate with trimethylaluminium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=A Convenient Preparation of Trimethylborane and Triethylborane|author=Roland Koumlstera, Paul Bingera Wilhelm, V.

Trimethylborane spontaneously ignites in air if the concentration is high enough.  It burns with a green flame producing soot.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |citeseerx = 10.1.1.137.1104|title=Military and Civilian Pyrotechnics|page=24|author=Herbert Ellern|year=1968|publisher=Chemical Publishing Company}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Slower oxidation with oxygen in a solvent or in the gas phase can produce dimethyltrioxadiboralane, which contains a ring of two boron and three oxygen atoms.  However the major product is dimethylborylmethylperoxide, which rapidly decomposes to dimethoxymethylborane.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Barton|first1=Lawrence|last2=Crump|first2=John M.|last3=Wheatley|first3=Jeffrey B.|title=Trioxadiborolanes from the oxidation of methyldiborane|journal=Journal of Organometallic Chemistry|date=June 1974|volume=72|issue=1|pages=C1–C3|doi=10.1016/s0022-328x(00)82027-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trimethylborane is a strong [[Lewis acid]].  It reacts with water and chlorine at room temperature.  It also reacts with grease but not with [[Teflon]] or glass.&lt;ref name=IS/&gt;  Trimethylborane can form an adduct with [[ammonia]]: (NH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;):B(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref name=nbs/&gt;

Trimethylborane reacts with [[diborane]] to disproportionate to form [[methylborane|monomethyldiborane]] and [[dimethylborane|dimethyldiborane]]:  (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)BH&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;.BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt; and (CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;BH.BH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;.

It reacts as a gas with [[trimethylphosphine]] to form a solid Lewis salt with a heat of formation of −41 kcal per mol.  This adduct has a heat of sublimation of −24.6 kcal/mol.  No reaction occurs with [[trimethylarsine]] or [[trimethylstibine]].&lt;ref name=dcm/&gt;

Methyl lithium reacting with the Trimethylborane produces a tetramethylborate salt: LiB(CH&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;4&lt;/sub&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;Georg Wittig in 1958&lt;/ref&gt;  The tetramethylborate ion has a negative charge and is [[Isoelectronicity|isoelectronic]] with [[neopentane]], [[tetramethylsilane]], and the [[tetramethylammonium]] cation.

==Use==
Trimethylborane has been used as a neutron counter.  For this use it has to be very pure.&lt;ref name=nbs&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gaylon S. Ross|title=Preparation of High Purity Trimethylborane|journal=Journal of Research of the National Bureau of Standards Section A|volume=66|number=1|date=2 October 1961|url=http://nvl.nist.gov/pub/nistpubs/jres/066/1/V66.N01.A06.pdf|displayauthors=etal }}&lt;/ref&gt;  It is also used in [[chemical vapour deposition]] where boron and carbon need to be deposited together.
