The '''Books of Jeu''' are two [[gnostic]] texts considered part of the [[New Testament apocrypha]]. The earliest known copy is written in [[Coptic language|Coptic]], and appears as part of the [[Bruce Codex]].{{sfn|DeConick|Shaw|Turner|2013|page=137}}

== Illustrative diagrams ==
One of the unusual features of the Books of Jeu are that they predominantly consist of mystic incantations and similarly esoteric diagrams, often including concentric circles and squares. Like much of gnostic teaching, it was only designed to be understood once a certain level of understanding was reached, and so appears to the casual observer to be quite obscure as to its meaning or purpose. The text has only been known for a brief time, and so there is not much academic research into them, however it does appear to be the case that the texts are some sort of manual for one or more unknown gnostic ritual(s).{{Citation needed|date=August 2017}}

'''Ecotechnics''' is defined as the '[[techne]]' of bodies. Ecotechnics thinks of the body as a technology which makes possible the inclusion of a whole new range of bodies. This gives people more agency and [[biopower]] over their own use of their bodies. This makes it usable for [[queer theory]] and [[disability studies]]. The term is then also central in Sullivan's and Murray's collection of essays ''Queering the Technologisation of Bodies''. It is built on [[Bernard Stiegler]]'s work that sees the body and technology as a double process: the technology and the body are informed by each other. [[Derrida]] who extends on both Jean-Luc Nancy and Stiegler's ideas argues that the 'proper body' implicates interconnections of technical additions. Ecotechnics goes against the [[essentialist]] and binary notion of the body as a technological object which positions it within [[post-structuralism]]. The body can only be understood within its environment and this environment is a technical one.

Dzhemal's maternal grandfather, Shapovalov, was the director of the [[Maly Theatre (Moscow)|Maly Theatre]] and First Deputy [[Minister of Culture of the Soviet Union]]. Irina Shapovalova gave birth to Geydar at age 18, divorcing his [[Azerbaijani people|Azerbaijani]] father soon afterwards. Her second marriage was to a military seaman, who moved with her to [[Estonia]] (then the [[Estonian SSR]]). A few years later, with a third husband, she returned to Moscow. Dzhemal was raised by his grandparents.
  
In 1965, after graduation from school and with assistance from his grandfather, Dzhemal entered the [[Institute of Oriental Languages]] at [[Moscow State University]], but a year later was expelled "for [[bourgeois nationalism]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rusrev.org/content/experts/default.asp?shmode=2&amp;idc=965&amp;ids=1|script-title=ru:Гейдар Джемаль|publisher=Russian Expert Review|language=Russian|accessdate=11 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then took a job as an editor at "Medicine" Publishing House, where he met a graduate of the [[Moscow State University]], [[Ilya Moskvin]]. He worked at the "Medicine" as an editor and edited many books on [[psychiatry]].

In the mid-1970s, friends advised Dzhemal, who was interested in psychiatry, to feign a mental illness in order to solve some problems with the police, who tried to prosecute him "for [[Parasitism (social offense)|parasitism]]". This worked as he was subsequently registered at a psychiatric institution. By that time, Dzhemal was already married; he raised his son Orkhan ("Yury").

Dzhemal died on December 5, 2016. He was 69 years old.

==Activism==
Since 1979, he was active in the underground [[All-Soviet Islamic movement]]. In the late 1980s, together with [[Aleksandr Dugin]], Dzhemal became a member of the nationalist [[Pamyat]] Society, but then disassociated with the organization completely. In 1990, Dzhemal took part in the creation of the ''Islamskaya Partiya Vozrozhdeniya'' ([[Islamic Renaissance Party (Russia)|Islamic Renaissance Party]]) in [[Astrakhan]] and became a deputy chairman of the party. In the same year he established an information center "[[Tauhid]]". From 1991 to 1993, he published the newspaper ''[[Al-Vakhdat]]'' (''Unity''). From 1993 to 1996, Dzhemal put on a few TV shows on Islamic issues (''[[Nyne]]'' (''Today''), ''[[Minaret]]'', etc.). In 1998, Dzhemal did a lecture tour in South Africa. In 1999, at the [[Orthodox Church|Orthodox]]-Islamic conference in [[St. Petersburg]] he put forward the thesis of the possibility of an [[anti-imperialist]] strategic alliance between people of Islam and [[Orthodox Christianity]]'s spirituality.

Dzhemal was among the 34 first signatories of the online anti-[[Vladimir Putin]] manifesto, "[[Putin must go]]", published on 10 March 2010.

Dzhemal commented on the [[Armenia]]n-[[Azerbaijan]]i [[Nagorno-Karabakh conflict]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Hasanov|first=A.|title=Heydar Jamal: By His London Speech Armenian President Announced His Consent to Withdraw From Azerbaijan's Occupied Lands|url=http://www.armeniandiaspora.com/showthread.php?216217-Heydar-Jamal-By-His-London-Speech-Armenian-President-Announced-His|accessdate=14 February 2014|newspaper=[[day.az]]|date=15 February 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Philosophy ==
{{unreferenced section|date=December 2016}}
Dzhemal's political analysis can be characterized as [[Islamic]] [[Marxism]]. In Dzhemal's writing, Marxism and Islam are both characterized by [[eschatology]], and the Islamic [[ummah]] play the [[Messianism|messianic]] role of [[Marx]]'s [[proletariat]] in ushering in the final stage of history. The modern world, in which [[imperialism]] has been replaced by what Dzhemal calls [[mundialization]], has at its core a conflict between [[transnational corporations]] and the government of the United States. The transnational corporations are run by a "super[[elite]]," which has its roots in European (and primarily British) [[aristocratic]] families. He believes that the [[September 11 attacks|events on September 11th]] are a grandiose provocation of superelite against the United States and the [[Islamic world]]. He has called [[Osama bin Laden]] and [[Taliban]] "creatures [[CIA]]" and  [[Zionism]] together with the [[KGB]], tools leading the superelite to domination over a planet.

In [[philosophy of religion]], Dzhemal has drawn on the tradition of [[German Romanticism]] to distinguish the religion of [[prophet]]s (which he sees as the religion of passionate expression) and the religion of [[priests]]. He believes that the prophets in the tradition of [[Abraham]] began from a position of [[creativity]] and [[novelty]], while priests are always fierce advocates of [[tradition]]. True religion, Dzhema believed is the religion of [[faith]] and [[death]]. Dzhemal did not accept all of the [[sects of Islam]]. He rejects [[Sufism]], the [[Hashemite]] Islam of the [[Arab people|Arab]] [[The Establishment|establishment]] and "the rule of the [[Turkic peoples|Turkic]] elements" that he believes has led to stagnation.
Dzhemal claimed that there are three major "clubs" in the world: Liberal club, Traditional club, Radical club. He claimed that liberalism is retreating and soon shall be replaced by rising Traditionalism. Radical club would be in opposition to both liberal and traditional club. 
In his point of view: 50% minus 1 share of the world was owned by Liberal club, 25% plus 1 share was owned by Traditional club. The remaining 25% were owned by organized crime, global jewish community and international bureaucracy. His major followers are Russian journalist Maxim Shevchenko, Russian philosopher Ruslan Aisin and his son Orhan Dzhemal. Orhan Dzhemal died in 2018 in Central African Republic where he worked as a journalist.
The [[anthropology]] of Dzhemal is based on a [[dichotomy]] of a [[divine spark]] and "[[clay]]" in the person.

'''Guidobaldo del Monte''' (11 January 1545 &amp;ndash; 6 January 1607, var. '''Guidobaldi''' or '''Guido Baldi'''), [[Marquess|Marquis]] del Monte, was an [[Italy|Italian]] [[mathematician]], [[philosopher]] and [[astronomer]] of the 16th century.

== Biography ==
Del Monte was born in [[Pesaro]]. His father, Ranieri, was from a leading wealthy family in [[Urbino]]. Ranieri was noted for his role as a [[soldier]] and also as the author of two books on [[military architecture]]. The Duke of Urbino, Duke Guidobaldo II, honoured him with the title Marchese del Monte so the family had only become a noble one in the generation before Guidobaldo. On the death of his father Guidobaldo inherited the title of Marchese.

Guidobaldo studied [[mathematics]] at the [[University of Padua]] in 1564. While there he became a friend of the great Italian poet [[Torquato Tasso]]. In fact Guidobaldo may have known Tasso before they studied at Padua together, for Tasso was almost exactly the same age as Guidobaldo and had been educated at the court of the Duke of Urbino, with the duke's son, from 1556.

Guidobaldo then served as a soldier in the ensuing conflict in [[Hungary]] between the [[Habsburg Empire]] and the [[Ottoman Empire]]. After serving in the army, Guidobaldo returned to his estate of (Monte Baroccio) [[Mombaroccio]] in the [[Marche]], where he was able to spend his time doing research into mathematics, [[mechanics]], [[astronomy]] and [[optics]]. He studied mathematics under [[Federico Commandino]] during this period and became one of his most staunch disciples. He also became a friend of [[Bernardino Baldi]], who was also a student of Commandino around the same time.

He corresponded with several mathematicians including [[Giacomo Contarini]], [[Francesco Barozzi]] and [[Galileo Galilei]]. His invention of a [[Technical drawing|drafting]] instrument for constructing regular [[polygon]]s and dividing a line into any number of segments was incorporated as a feature of Galileo's geometric and military [[compass]].

Guidobaldo was also important in helping Galileo Galilei in his academic career. Galileo, then a promising, but unemployed 26-year-old, had written an essay on [[hydrostatic balance]], which struck Guidobaldo as being nothing short of genius. He then commended Galileo to his brother, the Cardinal Del Monte, who referred him to the powerful Duke of [[Tuscany]], [[Ferdinando I de' Medici]]. Under his patronage, Galileo got an indication to a professorship of mathematics at the [[University of Pisa]], in 1589. Guidobaldo became a staunch friend of Galileo and helped him again in 1592, when he had to apply to the chair of mathematics at the [[University of Padua]], due to the hatred and machinations of [[Don Giovanni de' Medici|Giovanni de' Medici]], a son of [[Cosimo I de' Medici]], against Galileo. Notwithstanding their friendship, Guidobaldo was a critic of Galileo's principle of the isochronicity of the [[pendulum]], a major discovery which Guidobaldo thought was impossible.

Guidobaldo wrote an influential book about [[perspective (graphical)|perspective]], titled ''Perspectivae Libri VI'', published at [[Pesaro]] in 1600. Several painters, architects and the theater [[stage design]]er [[Nicola Sabbatini]] used this geometrical knowledge in their works.

He died at [[Mombaroccio]] in 1607.

He later became an [[associate professor]] there from 1910 to 1927 and then a temporary professor until his death in 1940. Landtman was the first modern sociological anthropologist. His most important journey was a two-year trip to [[Papua New Guinea]] where he lived with the Kiwai Papuans from 1910 to 1912. He was from 1922 to 1924 a member of the [[Parliament of Finland]], where he represented the [[Swedish People's Party of Finland]] (SFP).

[[File:The grave of Henry Calderwood, Morningside Cemetery, Edinburgh.jpg|thumb|The grave of Henry Calderwood, Morningside Cemetery, Edinburgh]]

Rev '''Henry Calderwood''' [[FRSE]] LLD (10 May 1830, [[Peebles]] – 19 November 1897, Edinburgh) was a Scottish [[Minister of religion|minister]] and philosopher.

==Life==

He was born in [[Peebles]] on 10 May 1830, the son of William Calderwood, a corn merchant, and his wife Elizabeth Mitchell.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

He was educated at the [[Stewart's Melville College|Edinburgh Institution]] and then the [[Royal High School (Edinburgh)|High School]] in [[Edinburgh]], and later attended [[University of Edinburgh]].&lt;ref name = Oxford&gt;{{cite web |url= http://oxfordindex.oup.com/view/10.1093/oi/authority.20110803095542471|title= Overview, Henry Calderwood, (1830—1897) philosopher|author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= 2014|website= Oxford Index|publisher= Oxford University Press|access-date= 28 July 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; He studied for the ministry of the [[United Presbyterian Church of Scotland]], and in 1856 was ordained pastor of the Greyfriars church, [[Glasgow]]. He also examined in mental philosophy for the [[University of Glasgow]] from 1861 to 1864, and from 1866 conducted the [[moral philosophy]] classes at that university, until in 1868 he became Professor of Moral Philosophy at Edinburgh, holding this post until his death 29 years later.&lt;ref&gt;Gilbert, W.M., editor, ''Edinburgh in the Nineteenth Century'', Edinburgh, 1901:183&lt;/ref&gt; He was made LL.D. of Glasgow in 1865.&lt;ref name = Oxford/&gt; At this point the family lived at 197 St Vincent Street.&lt;ref&gt;Glasgow Post Office Directory 1865-6&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1869 he was elected a Fellow of the [[Royal Society of Edinburgh]] his proposer being [[John Hutton Balfour]].&lt;ref&gt;http://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; His address was then given as ''Craigrowan'', a large villa in [[Merchiston]] on the west side of the city.&lt;ref&gt;http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=8367042&lt;/ref&gt;

His first and most famous work was The Philosophy of the Infinite (1854), in which he attacked the statement of [[William Hamilton (metaphysician)|Sir William Hamilton]] that we can have no knowledge of the [[Infinity|Infinite]]. Calderwood maintained that such knowledge, though imperfect, is real and ever-increasing; that [[Faith]] implies [[Knowledge]]. His moral philosophy is in direct antagonism to [[Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel|Hegelian]] doctrine, and endeavours to substantiate the doctrine of divine sanction. Beside the data of experience, the mind has pure activity of its own whereby it apprehends the fundamental realities of life and combat. He wrote in addition ''A Handbook of Moral Philosophy'', ''On the Relations of Mind and Brain'', ''Science and Religion'', ''The Evolution of Man's Place in Nature''.

Among his religious works the best-known is his ''Parables of Our Lord'', and just before his death he finished a Life of [[David Hume]] in the [[List of books for the "Famous Scots Series"|''Famous Scots Series'']]. His interests were not confined to religious and intellectual matters; as the first chairman of the Edinburgh school board, he worked hard to bring the Education Act into working order. He published a well-known treatise on education. In the cause of philanthropy and [[Temperance movement|temperance]] he was indefatigable. In politics he was at first a [[Liberal Party (UK)|Liberal]], but became a [[Liberal Unionist]] at the time of the Home Rule Bill.

Calderwood was an advocate of [[theistic evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;[[David N. Livingstone|Livingstone, David N]]. (2009). ''Evolution and Religion''. In [[Michael Ruse]]; Joseph Travis. ''Evolution: The First Four Billion Years''. Harvard University Press. p. 357. {{ISBN|978-0-674-03175-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; In his book ''Evolution and Man's Place in Nature'' he wrote that "evolution stands before us as an impressive reality in the history of Nature."&lt;ref&gt;Lundin, Roger. (2013). ''Christ Across the Disciplines: Past, Present, Future''. Wm. B. Eerdmans Publishing Co. p. 95. {{ISBN|978-0-8028-6947-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is buried in [[Morningside Cemetery, Edinburgh]], towards the south-west. His wife Anne Hutton Leadbetter (d.1912) lies with him.

==Family==

He married Anne Hutton Leadbetter in 1857.

Their children included the marine biologist [[William Leadbetter Calderwood]] [[FRSE]] (1865–1950).

'''Hyujeong''' ({{korean|hangul=휴정|hanja=休靜}}, 1520-1604), also called '''Seosan Daesa''' (서산대사, 西山大師) was a [[Korean Seon]] master. As was common for monks in this time, he travelled from place to place, living in a succession of monasteries. [[bhikkhu|Buddhist monks]] had been forced to keep a low profile since General [[Taejo of Joseon|Yi Seonggye]] had been forced to eject Buddhism from its state of total permeation of government in order to gain the support of [[Neo-Confucianism|Neo-Confucian]] scholar-officials to consolidate his position against his Buddhist political opponents when he overthrew [[Gongyang of Goryeo]] in 1392 to become King [[Taejo of Joseon]].

Before ever having tested his hand as a military commander, Hyujeong was a first-rate [[Zen master|Seon master]] and the author of a number of important religious texts, the most important of which is probably his ''Seongagwigam'' ({{korean|hanja=禪家龜鑑|hangul=선가귀감}}), a guide to Seon practice studied by Korean monks even today. Like most monks of the Joseon period, Hyujeong had been initially educated in Neo-Confucian philosophy. Dissatisfied, though, he wandered through the mountain monasteries. Later, after making a name for himself as a teacher, he was made arbiter of the Seon school by [[Myeongjong of Joseon]], who was sympathetic towards Buddhism. He soon resigned from this responsibility, though, returning to the itinerant life, advancing his Seon studies and teaching at monasteries all around Korea.

At the beginning of the 1590s, [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]], after stabilising [[Sengoku period|Sengoku-era Japan]] under his rule, made preparations for a large-scale invasion of Joseon. Joseon was unaware and was unprepared for the Japanese invasion. In 1592, after Japan’s request for aid conquering [[Ming dynasty|Ming China]] was rebuffed, approximately 200,000 Japanese soldiers invaded Joseon, and the [[Japanese invasions of Korea (1592–98)]] began.

At the beginning of the first invasion, [[Seonjo of Joseon]] fled the capital, leaving a weak, poorly trained army to defend the country. In desperation he called on Hyujeong to organise monks into guerilla units. Even at 73 years of age he managed to recruit and deploy some 5,000 of these warrior monks, who enjoyed some instrumental successes.

At first, the government armies of Joseon suffered repeated defeats, and the Japanese armies marched north up to [[Pyongyang]] and [[Hamgyong Province]]. At sea, however, the Joseon navy, under the command of Admiral [[Yi Sun-sin]], enjoyed successive victories. Throughout the country, loyal volunteer armies formed and fought against the Japanese together with the warrior monks and the government armies of Joseon.

The presence of Hyujeong's monk army, operating out of the [[Heungguksa]] deep in the mountain of [[Yeongchwisan]], was a critical factor in the eventual expulsion of the Japanese invaders in 1593 and again in 1598.

The Taekwon-Do pattern [[Hyeong#Seo-San|Seo-San]] is named in his honor.

'''James Oliver Freedman''' (September 21, 1935 – March 21, 2006) was an American educator and academic administrator.  A graduate of [[Harvard College]] and [[Yale Law School]], he served briefly as Dean of the [[University of Pennsylvania Law School]] before becoming the sixteenth president of the [[University of Iowa]] from 1982 to 1987, and then the fifteenth [[president]] of [[Dartmouth College]], from 1987 to 1998. At both Iowa and Dartmouth, Freedman sought to create as ''[[The New York Times]]'' described it, "a haven for intellectuals," with mixed results.

== University of Iowa Presidency ==
Freedman's tenure at the University of Iowa was marked by his support for a $25 million laser research center. In his words, "The University of Iowa can grasp the opportunity for national and world leadership in laser science."&lt;ref&gt;https://select.nytimes.com/gst/abstract.html?res=F50715F9355E0C708CDDAB0994DE484D81&lt;/ref&gt; Freedman argued that the laser would become a magnet for research grants from Federal and International agencies, and the Iowa legislature appropriated the $25 million necessary to build the center.  The center was unable to attract significant research funding, however, after it was completed.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

== Dartmouth Presidency ==
His administration was marked by numerous academic initiatives, a growth of the physical campus, and a strengthening of Dartmouth's graduate programs and professional schools. A small but vocal number of alumni viewed the initiatives the "Harvardization of Dartmouth."{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

President Freedman established or revitalized programs in Latin American, Latino, and Caribbean Studies; Environmental Studies; Jewish Studies; and Linguistics and Cognitive Science. He introduced or restored the teaching of the Arabic, Hebrew, and Japanese languages, founded the Institute of Arctic Studies, and incorporated into the curriculum majors in Women's Studies and African and African-American Studies.  During his administration, Dartmouth achieved gender parity in the student body. In the professorial ranks the College led the Ivy League with the highest proportion of women among tenured and tenure-track faculty.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Freedman also presided over the largest capital campaign in Dartmouth's history, the "Will to Excel" campaign, which raised $568 million, exceeding the original $425 million goal.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}  His administration saw the addition of state-of-the-art buildings for the Computer Sciences, Chemistry, and Psychology, as well as The Roth Center for Jewish Life and the Rauner Special Collections Library.

Shortly before he stepped down in 1998, ground was broken for the Baker-Berry Library project, a pioneering model for access to books and electronic information in the 21st century.

The author of ''Idealism and Liberal Education,'' Freedman became a spokesman for the importance of the liberal arts.

President Freedman died of [[non-Hodgkins lymphoma]] on March 21, 2006.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

== Criticism ==
Some critics believed that Freedman was uninterested in maintaining Dartmouth as an undergraduate college first, a research and graduate university second.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

The one event in Freedman's presidency that garnered the most press was the so-called "Hitler Quote" scandal of [[The Dartmouth Review]] in 1990. A member of the staff of the controversial conservative weekly paper inserted a quote  from ''[[Mein Kampf]]'' into the masthead of one edition of the paper.  This edition of the Review was dated on Yom Kippor, the holiest day in the Jewish year. In the same edition, the paper also printed a drawing of Freedman as Hitler. The paper's editor discovered the quote three days after the paper was distributed, pulled available copies, and issued a campus-wide apology, but the quotation was seen as the latest in a series of attention-getting stunts that were either provocative or offensive depending on the reader's point of view.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

In response to the Review's activities, including its publication of the quotation, students and members of Freedman's administration organized a "Rally Against Hate."  The rally became a focal point for national conservative criticism of Freedman and of what was seen as "[[political correctness]]" generally.{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}}

Freedman's administration undertook the building of the "second Green" in an attempt to create a genuine sense of intellectual community at the College.

[[George Mason University School of Law|George Mason]] law professor [[Todd Zywicki]], a Dartmouth alum (and trustee) later referred to Freedman as a "truly evil man" whose "agenda was to turn Dartmouth into [[Harvard]]."&lt;ref&gt;[http://alumni.dartmouth.edu/default.aspx?id=736 Todd Zywicki, Speech to Pope Institute, Raleigh, N.C., October 2, 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; Former Dartmouth Senior Fellow [[William C. Dowling]], noting that the danger of Dartmouth's ever becoming like Harvard was exceedingly remote, characterized Zywicki's remark as typical of a "brutal philistinism too often associated with the Dartmouth name." Dartmouth's Board of Trustees publicly repudiated any association with Zywicki's sentiments. On December 18, 2007, head of the Board Ed Haldeman (Dartmouth '70) issued a statement noting that "Mr. Zywicki has a apologized to members of the Freedman family and indicated that he would like to retract other parts of his speech." &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dartmouth.edu/~trustees/docs/Trustee Statement on Zywicki.PDF]&lt;/ref&gt; Zywicki was not reelected to the Board.

He was a major figure in [[physical chemistry]] research specializing in [[liquid]]s and [[electrolyte|nonelectrolyte]] solutions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Seaborg, Glenn T.|authorlink=Glenn T.

==Education and professorship==
He was born in [[Camden, New Jersey]] on November 16, 1881.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Biographical Index of Former Fellows of the Royal Society of Edinburgh 1783 – 2002|date=July 2006|publisher=The Royal Society of Edinburgh|isbn=0 902 198 84 X|url=https://www.royalsoced.org.uk/cms/files/fellows/biographical_index/fells_indexp1.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hildebrand graduated from the [[University of Pennsylvania]] in 1903. He served briefly in the faculty before going to the [[University of California, Berkeley]] as a chemistry instructor in 1913. Within five years he became an Assistant Professor. In 1918 he was elevated to Associate Professor before finally being granted Full Professorship a year later in 1919. He served as the Dean of the College of Chemistry from 1949 through 1951. He retired from full-time teaching in 1952&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |journal= Annual Review of Physical Chemistry |volume= 14 |pages= 1–5 |year= 1963 |title= Fifty Years of Physical Chemistry in Berkeley |author= Hildebrand, JH |doi=10.1146/annurev.pc.14.100163.000245|bibcode = 1963ARPC...14....1H }}&lt;/ref&gt; but remained Professor Emeritus at Berkeley until his death. Hildebrand Hall on the Berkeley campus is named for him.

==Accomplishments, discoveries, honors==
His 1924 monograph on the solubility of non-electrolytes, ''Solubility'', was the classic reference for almost half a century. In 1927, Hildebrand coined the term "[[regular solution]]" (to be contrasted with "[[ideal solution]]") and discussed their thermodynamic aspects in 1929. A regular solution is one involving no entropy change when a small amount of one of its components is transferred to it from an ideal solution of the same composition, the total volume remaining unchanged.  Hildebrand's many scientific papers and chemistry texts include ''An Introduction to Molecular Kinetic Theory'' (1963) and ''Viscosity and Diffusivity'' (1977). He received the Distinguished Service Medal in 1918 and the King's Medal (British) in 1948.

Hildebrand served on the Council of the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] and was also a member of the Citizens Advisory Committee on Education to the California Legislature. Hildebrand made several discoveries of which the most notable was the introduction in the mid-1920s of [[helium]] and [[oxygen]] breathing mixtures to replace [[air]] for divers to alleviate the condition known as [[Decompression sickness|the bends]]. He realized that the problem was caused by [[nitrogen]] gas dissolved in blood at high [[pressure]], which was expelled too rapidly on return to the surface. Helium does not cause the same problem due to its much lower solubility in aqueous solutions such as blood. This discovery was later used to save the lives of 33 members of the [[submarine]] ''[[USS Sailfish (SS-192)|USS Squalus]]'' which went down in 1939.

Hildebrand won virtually every major prize in the field of chemistry except the [[Nobel Prize]]. The [[American Chemical Society]] created the [[Joel Henry Hildebrand Award]] in his honor for work pertaining to the field of theoretical and experimental chemistry of liquids. The first award was presented to Hildebrand himself in 1981 as part of the observances of his 100th birthday. The award is currently sponsored by [[Exxon Mobil]]. He has been identified by Kantha in 2001, as one of the 35 centenarian scientists who belonged to an unusual cluster that was newly formed in the 20th century.

Professor Hildebrand often said he most cherished his role as a teacher. In an interview conducted shortly before his 100th birthday, he observed: "Good teaching is primarily an art, and can neither be defined or standardized ... Good teachers are born ''and'' made; neither part of the process can be omitted." &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pfaff |first=Timothy |title=An interview with Joel Hildebrand |journal=California Monthly |page=10 |date=October 1981}}&lt;/ref&gt; He remained committed to working with undergraduate students even [[centenarian|at the age of 100]]. He came to his office on campus nearly every school day until declining health made it impossible.

Hildebrand was also active in the [[Sierra Club]], serving as its president from 1937 through 1940. As a member he contributed to many important land-use reports about State and [[National Parks]] in California. He also managed the 1936 US Olympic Ski Team.

==Scientific Contributions==
His study of the solubility of non electrolytes led to his formation of the "[[Hildebrand solubility parameter]]"

:&lt;math&gt;\delta = \sqrt{(\Delta H_v - RT) / V_m}&lt;/math&gt;.

The general idea is that a potential solute will be soluble in a solvent which has a comparable value for &lt;math&gt;\delta&lt;/math&gt;.
 
This work was then used in the formation of the more comprehensive "[[Hansen solubility parameter]]", which accounts not just for dispersion interactions between solvent and solute (as the Hildebrand parameter does) but also for hydrogen bonding and polar interactions – thus lifting the restriction of application to just non-polar species. Hansen shows great respect for Hildebrand and his work and indeed acknowledges that his work of the Hansen solubility parameter would not have been possible without the great contribution that Hildebrand made to this field.

Hildebrand was also outspoken on the manner in which small non-polar species exist in water. The dissolution of species such as methane in water is accompanied by both a negative enthalpy and a negative entropy. A common model for this behavior is the iceberg or clathrate type model, in which a network or cage of hydrogen bonded water develops around the methane molecule. This explains the drop in enthalpy since hydrogen bonding is increased compared to pure water and the drop in entropy since a solvent excluded volume has come into existence along with an ordered network of water molecules.

Hildebrand challenged this popular view in a series of papers in the late 1960s and 1970s and concluded that methane has a just a 40% lower diffusivity in water than in carbon tetrachloride. If water was enclatherated or in an iceberg type structure then he predicted that this diffusivity difference between water and carbon tetrachloride ought to be significantly larger.

This conflict of ideas still exists in the literature with publications between 2000–2010 for the clathrate type hydrophobic hydration still being submitted in computer simulations of various types. There are papers however which cite Hildebrand's earlier criticisms of this model and suggest that hydrophobicity arises from the small size of water increasing the free energy required to develop a suitable cavity for certain solutes to occupy.

Given the conflict in this field and the high level of interest involved it seems that Hildebrand may continue contributing to the scientific community for quite some time yet.

With George Scatchard, Hildebrand developed an equation for excess molar volumes in mixtures.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Scatchard |first=George |title=Change of volume on mixing and the equations for non-electrolyte mixtures |url=https://pubs.rsc.org/en/content/articlelanding/1937/tf/tf9373300160#!divAbstract |year=1937 |volume=33 |journal=[[Journal of the Chemical Society, Faraday Transactions|Transactions of the Faraday Society]] |access-date=August 2, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Hildebrand |first1=Joel H. |last2=Scott |first2=Robert S. |title=The Solubility of Nonelectrolytes |date=April 1951 |pages=619–620 |volume=55 |issue=4 |journal=[[The Journal of Physical Chemistry]] |doi=10.1021/j150487a027 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Hildebrand wounded in campus shooting==
On August 4, 1919, Hildebrand was shot and wounded by Roger Sprague, a chemistry assistant who was despondent at not being recommended for further advancement.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://cdnc.ucr.edu/cgi-bin/cdnc?a=d&amp;d=SU19190805.2.6| title=Refused Position, Man Attempts Life Of Two Professors| work=[[The Sacramento Union]] |volume=209 |number=36 |date=August 5, 1919| page=1| accessdate=April 4, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

John Foster was tutorial Fellow of [[Brasenose College, Oxford]], from 1966 to 2005 and was Emeritus Fellow there until his death in 2009.

==Biography==
Foster was born in North London on 5 May 1941 and grew up in [[Southgate, London|Southgate]]. He studied at [[Mercers' School]], but transferred to the [[City of London School]] to do A-levels after Mercers' was closed—he wrote a letter to ''The Times'' to protest the closing of the school. He started studying classics at [[Lincoln College, Oxford]], but transferred to [[psychology, philosophy and physiology]] after discovering a distaste for studying ancient history. Foster became friends with [[A.&amp;nbsp;J. Ayer]] although was strongly critical of Ayer's philosophy. He later wrote a book on Ayer's work that [[Anthony Quinton]] described as "the only serious monograph about his philosophy".&lt;ref name="Sinclair"&gt;{{Cite journal|url=http://www.bnc.ox.ac.uk/downloads/the_brazen_nose_2010.pdf|title=John Foster Remembered|first=Peter|last=Sinclair|pages=135–141|work=The Brazen Nose|year=2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foster was a devoted Christian and an outspoken pro-life campaigner. Foster met his wife-to-be Helen in 1963 and the two married in [[Royal Tunbridge Wells]] in 1967. He joined the [[Church of England]]. In 1989 both John and Helen converted from [[Anglicanism]] to [[Roman Catholicism]].&lt;ref name="Sinclair" /&gt;

Foster died 1 January 2009.

==Philosophical work&lt;!--'Phenomenalistic idealism' redirects here--&gt;==
In 2008, he put forward a thesis called '''phenomenalistic idealism'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt;, which combines [[phenomenalism]] and [[idealism]].&lt;ref&gt;Foster, John (2008).

'''Juan Manuel García Grüber''' (September 7, 1904 – September 21, 1997) was a [[Venezuela]]n economist, financier, writer, philosopher and [[diplomat]].
As Venezuelan ambassador in seven countries

He was born in Guasipati, Edo. [[Bolívar]], Venezuela. son  of  Mercedes Gruber of German descent and Dr. Juan Manuel García Parra, a leading figure of abdominal surgery in sterile women, creator of the first formula known to favor high levels of fertily and founder of the Garcia Parra Hospital in his native Guasipati,

After completing his studies in economics and finance, he held the position of Chief of the Justice Section at the Department of Internal Affairs. 1953, he became the Venezuelan General Consul to Peru and was subsequently appointed as the Venezuelan Ambassador to Nicaragua, Panama,Cuba,Peru,Costa Rica. He was standing right next to Nicaraguan President [[Anastasio Somoza García]] when he was shot to death by [[Rigoberto López Pérez]] in 1956.

Throughout his lifetime, he wrote extensively on oil, democracy, arts, renaissance and various cultural subjects. Dr. García Grüber participated in the rescue of his family when they were held captive in revolutionary Nicaragua. In 1979, a plane from the Venezuelan Air Force piloted by his wife's nephew, Captain Raúl Hernández, was hastily sent in order to help set the hostages free. According to different news broadcasts at the time, the family was a victim of the Somoza guerrilla (sandinista) and provisions had been made to kill them right before they attempted to escape through the nearest airport. Their liberation was eventually possible when the Venezuelan aircraft opened fire against [[sandinista]] soldiers who tried to thwart the operation.

Later in his life, he became the President of the Venezuelan Institute for Hispanic Culture in [[Caracas]], [[Venezuela]]. Dr. García Grüber received several awards for his achievements and was recognized as a peer by the most respected Hispanic language and literature academicians. among which include the Order of the Liberator Simon Bolivar. Order by represent Venezuela in Ibero American Chamber,order in first grade Venezuelan Red Cross,among others not mentioned two hundred medals, was a famous representative of his country abroad, and inside it. His death caused great sorrow, for all the great personalities, including ex former President Rafael Caldera who was his friend and liberator of the current President Hugo Chávez Frias
Dr. García Grüber and his wife met Juan Carlos de Borbón, King of Spain, on his first visit to Venezuela. His strong ties to the embassies of Spain, Colombia, Perú, Panamá and Nicaragua account for his many accolades in the diplomatic and cultural fields.
His work as a universal writer was published by influential editorial houses in Venezuela as he became an incisive columnist in well-known local newspapers. He regularly condemned his country's political ways and the ever-growing scourge of corruption in Latin America. He had a long time personal and professional association with his brother in law, Dr. Jorge Gómez Mantellini, former Governor of Caracas.
As part of his duties as head of the Venezuelan Institute for Hispanic Culture, he unveiled the first statue of Spanish monarch Isabel La Católica ever to grace a Caracas square.

He was married to Bertha Domínguez Urbano-Taylor, a sibling of [[Ricardo Domínguez Urbano-Taylor]]. According to several different sources, his wife's family comes from the prestigious Royal Court of North Ireland, which migrated to Venezuela after her predecessor relinquished a mission entrusted upon him by the Kingdom. To this day, it remains his predecessor, mister emilio urhban taylor was entrusted with the king in the royal court and was consular prime minister whose entrust in Venezuela is unknown is also unknown because he never returned to ireland staying in the South American country to do his dismissal He had two daughters, Bertha García-Grüber D., Morella García-Grüber D. and one son John García-Grüber D., who died in infancy. Their grandchildren: Juan Pablo Knoepffler Garcia, Luis Knoepffler Garcia, Aldo Knoepffler Garcia, Ana Knoepffler Garcia, Franco Knoepffler Garcia and Marcella Knoepffler Garcia; Mariella Barreto García, Alexandra Barreto García, Rossana Barreto García, Juan Carlos Barreto García, Carlos A.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32101">'''Juvenile hormones''' ('''JHs''') are a group of acyclic [[sesquiterpenoid]]s that regulate many aspects of [[insect physiology]].  The first discovery of a JH was by [[Vincent Wigglesworth]]. JHs regulate development, reproduction, [[diapause]], and [[polyphenism]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Riddiford |first=L. M. |title=Cellular and molecular actions of juvenile hormone I. General considerations and premetamorphic actions |year=1994 |journal=Advances in Insect Physiology |volume=24 |pages=213–274 |doi=10.1016/S0065-2806(08)60084-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Watt |first1=G.

F. |year=1994 |title=Insect Hormones |publisher=Princeton University Press |location=Princeton}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[insect]]s, JH (formerly called '''neotenin''') refers to a group of [[hormone]]s, which ensure growth of the [[larva]], while preventing [[Metamorphosis (biology)|metamorphosis]]. Because of their rigid exoskeleton, insects grow in their development by successively shedding their exoskeleton (a process known as [[molting]]).

Juvenile hormones are [[secretion|secreted]] by a pair of [[endocrine gland]]s behind the [[brain]] called the [[corpus allatum|corpora allata]]. JHs are also important for the production of eggs in female insects.

JH was isolated in 1965 by Williams and Slama and the first [[molecular structure]] of a final six was solved in 1967.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Röller |first1=H. |last2=Dahm |first2=K.H. |last3=Sweeley |first3=C.C. |last4=Trost |first4=B.M. |year=1967 |title=The Structure of the Juvenile Hormone |journal=Angewandte Chemie International Edition |volume=6 |issue=2 |pages=179–180 |doi=10.1002/anie.196701792}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Most insect species contain only juvenile growth hormone (JH) III.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Judy |first1=K.J. |last2=Schooley |first2=D.A. |last3=Dunham |first3=L.L. |last4=Hall |first4=M.S. |last5=Bergot |first5=B.J. |last6=Siddall |first6=J.B. |year=1973 |journal=Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America |title=Isolation, Structure, and Absolute Configuration of a New Natural Insect Juvenile Hormone from ''Manduca sexta'' |volume=70 |issue=5 |pages=1509–1513 |url=https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC433531/pdf/pnas00068-0223.pdf |pmc=433531 |pmid=16592086 |doi=10.1073/pnas.70.5.1509}}&lt;/ref&gt; To date JH 0, JH I, and JH II have been identified only in the [[Lepidoptera]] (butterflies and moths).

JH maintains a juvenile state. The level gradually decreases during the development of the insect, allowing it to proceed to successive [[instar]]s with each molt.

This has been demonstrated in various studies, most prominently that by [[Vincent Wigglesworth|V. B. Wigglesworth]] in 1960s. In this study, two adult ''[[Rhodnius]]'' had their blood systems linked, ensuring that the JH titre in both would be equal. One was a third instar ''Rhodnius'', the other was a fourth instar. When the corpora allata of the third instar insect were removed, the level of JH was equal in both insects to that in the fourth instar animal, and hence both proceeded to the fifth instar at the next moult. When the fourth instar ''Rhodnius'' had its corpora allata removed, both contained a third instar level of JH and hence one proceeded to instar four, and the other remained at this instar.

Generally, the removal of the corpora allata from juveniles will result in a [[diminutive]] adult at the next moult. Implantation of corpora allata into last larval instars will boost JH levels and hence produce a supernumary (extra) juvenile instar etc.

==In honey bees==
{{see also|Bee learning and communication}}
There is a complex interaction between JH, the hormone [[ecdysone]] and [[vitellogenin]]. In the development stage, as long as there is enough JH, the ecdysone promotes larva-to-larva molts. With lower amounts of JH, ecdysone promotes pupation. Complete absence of JH results in formation of the adult.&lt;ref&gt;Kimball, John W. (2002) [http://users.rcn.com/jkimball.ma.ultranet/BiologyPages/I/InsectHormones.html Insect hormones]&lt;/ref&gt;
In adult [[honey bee]]s, JH and [[Vitellogenin]] titers in general show an inverse pattern.&lt;ref&gt;Hartfelder K, Engels W (1998) Curr Top Dev Biol 40:45–77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bloch G, Wheeler DE, Robinson GE (2002) in Hormones, Brain, and Behavior,

JH titers in [[Worker bee|worker honey bees]] progressively increase through the first 15 or so days of the worker's life before the onset of [[forage (honey bee)|foraging]].&lt;ref&gt;Elekonich, M.

During the first 15 days, workers perform tasks inside the [[Beehive (beekeeping)|hive]], such as nursing larvae, constructing comb, and cleaning cells. JH titers peak around day 15; workers this age guard, remove dead bees from the colony, and fan at the colony entrance to cool the nest. Aggressiveness of guard bees is correlated with their blood JH levels. Even though guards have high JH levels, their ovaries are relatively undeveloped.&lt;ref&gt;Pearce A.N., Huang Z.Y., Breed M.D. (2001) Juvenile

== In Lepidoptera ==
JH in many butterfly and moth species are necessary for the production and release of the sex [[pheromone]] by females. Experiments conducted in ''[[Mythimna unipuncta]]'' (true armyworm moth) and ''[[Agrotis ipsilon]]'' (black cutworm moth) have shown that removing the corpus allata, which secretes JH, stops all release of sex pheromone. Furthermore, JH is important for ovarian development.&lt;ref&gt;Cusson, M., and J. N.

==Use as an insecticide==
Synthetic analogues of the juvenile hormone are used as an [[insecticide]], preventing the larvae from developing into adult insects. JH itself is expensive to synthesize and is unstable in light. At high levels of JH, larvae can still molt, but the result will only be a bigger larva, not an adult. Thus the [[Insect#Reproduction and development|insect's reproductive cycle]] is broken. One JH analogue, [[methoprene]], is approved by the [[WHO]] for use in drinking water [[cistern]]s to control [[mosquito]] larvae due to its exceptionally low toxicity (LD50 &gt;35,000&amp;nbsp;mg/kg in the rat).

==Regulation==
Juvenile hormone is produced in the [[corpora allata]] of insects. JH will disperse throughout the haemolymph and act on responsive tissues. JH is principally degraded by the [[enzymes]] [[Juvenile-hormone esterase]] (JHE) or [[juvenile hormone epoxide hydrolase]] (JHEH). JHE and JHEH both lead to suppression of JH signaling and response. Tissues responsive to JH may produce one or both of these enzymes.

JH stimulates the [[Insect physiology#Reproductive system|accessory glands]] of adult males, promoting gland growth and the production of accessory gland secretion. Yolk production ([[vitellogenesis]]) in female ovaries is also stimulated by JH action. JH may also regulate reproductive behaviour in both sexes.

'''Insect growth regulators'''
Insect growth regulators (IGRs) such as juvenile and moulting hormones or their analogs (juvenoids and ecdysoids) when used judiciously, have been found to be useful in insect culture such as sericulture industry. In addition, ecdysoids also show a variety of other uses such as insecticidal, as biochemical tool in gene expression studies, as wound healing and anabolic agents (body building agents with enhancing protein synthesis), as nutraceuticals and cosmetics (hair growth) IGRs occur in insects in very small amounts and are not practical source for these phytochemicals. However, with the discovery of their occurrence in significant quantities in some plants, IGRs and their analogs became easily available in substantial amounts. As a result, many new bioactivities of ecdysoids and juvenoids were discovered. Besides use in insect sericulture, they have found applications in apiculture and aquaculture (prawns). Ecdysoids show remarkable anabolic activities in human and are very much in demand as nutraceuticals (food supplements) including body building agent. Realizing the economic potential of IGRs, bioprospection for these compounds from indigenous plant sources was undertaken. Surveys indicate that a large number plants belonging to different taxa contain IGRs.

==Metabolism==
Juvenile hormone's activity is destroyed by two enzymes. JH esterase cleaves the methyl ester giving JH acid. JH acid is attached by JH epoxide hydrolase, which converts the epoxide group to a diol. The order of cleavage depends on the order of insect. In the Lepidoptera, the order is as given here; ester cleavage preceding epoxide hydration. Either one terminates the activity of the hormone. JH diol acid, the product of both enzymes, is acted on by JH diol kinase to increase the solubility for excretion.

==Biosynthesis==
The biosynthesis of JH is similar to that of cholesterol in animals. There are considerable differences between the biosynthesis of the homo-isoprenoid JHs found almost exclusively in Lepidoptera, as opposed to the isoprenoids JH III, JH III bisepoxide, and methyl farnesoate found in other insects.

Cholesterol biosynthesis has been exhaustively studied in animals. All steps occur in the cytosol. The starting material is citrate, which is exported by the mitochondrion when metabolic fuels are high. It is converted into acetyl-CoA, ADP, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and oxaloacetate by ATP-citrate lyase, together with ATP and CoASH as substrates. Three acetyl-CoAs are converted inoto HMG-CoA by the cytosolic isoforms  of [[thiolase]] and 3-hydroxy-3-methylglutaryl-CoA synthase. The HMG-CoA is then reduced by NADPH to mevalonate by HMG-CoA reductase, the rate controlling enzyme of cholesterol biosynthesis. This enzyme has 8 helical domains anchoring it in the Golgi membrane of the ER;&lt;ref&gt;Burg, J.S., Espenshade, P.J., 2011. Regulation of HMG-CoA reductase in mammals and yeast. Prog. Lipid Res. 50, 403-410&lt;/ref&gt; the catalytic domain is in the cytosol. It is strongly inhibited by the [[statins]], a class of drugs based on a mold metabolite which, at least at one time, were the largest selling class of drugs in the world. Mevalonate is acted of by a series of 3 kinases to give the highly labile 1,2-diphosphomevalonate-3-phosphate, which is acted on by a lyase to give phosphate, CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and [[isopentenyl diphosphate]].  Isopentenyl diphosphate isomerase converts the latter to the less stable [[dimethylallyl diphosphate]]. [[Farnesyl diphosphate synthase]] takes one DMAPP and two IPP to give the C&lt;sub&gt;15&lt;/sub&gt; metabolite [[farnesyl diphosphate]]. There are a large number of additional steps to generate cholesterol from IPP, the ubiquitous precursor of all isoprenoids.

It appears that the biosyntheis of JH III is identical to that of cholesterol, from production of IPP to FPP, although there appear to be no studies on export of citrate or other metabolites from the mitochondrion into the cytosol, or formation of [[acetyl-CoA]]. The enzymes of this pathway were first studied in Manduca sexta, which produces both homoisoprenoid and isoprenoid (JHIII) JHs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Judy | first1 = K.J. | last2 = Schooley | first2 = D.A. | last3 = Dunham | first3 = L.L. | last4 = Hall | first4 = M.S. | last5 = Bergot | first5 = B.J. | last6 = Siddall | first6 = J.B. | year = 1973 | title = Isolation, Structure, and Absolute Configuration of a New Natural Insect Juvenile Hormone from Manduca sexta | journal = Proc.

The latter is required for biosynthesis of JH I, JH II, and 4-methylJH I. 2 units of  homoDMAPP are required for JH I and 4methyl JH I biosynthesis, and one for JH II biosynthesis. All parts of the carbon skeleton comes from IPP.

However, at this point these pathways diverge. While the vast majority of  farnesyl diphosphate is converted into ultimately cholesterol in animals, in insects it is apparently acting on by a diphosphatase to give [[farnesol]], which in turn is acted on by an NAD+ dependent enzyme, farnesol/farnesal dehydrogenase in ''M. sexta''&lt;ref name="Baker, F.C. 1983"/&gt; to give farnesoic acid.

'''Kulatissa Nanda Jayatilleke''' (1 November 1920 – 23 July 1970) was an internationally recognised authority on [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] philosophy whose book ''Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge'' has been described as "an outstanding philosophical interpretation of the Buddha's teaching" in the Encyclopedia of Philosophy.&lt;ref name="EnPhil"&gt;Encyclopedia of Philosophy, vol. I (New Your, 1967) p420.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
Jayatilleke, was born on 1 November 1920, in [[Colombo]], [[British Ceylon]]. After completing his secondary education at the [[Royal College, Colombo|Royal College]] in Colombo, he pursued the study of [[Pali]] and [[Sanskrit]] at the [[University of Ceylon]] obtaining a first class honours degree. He continued his education at [[Cambridge University]] with a view to acquire a firm grounding in Western philosophy. He obtained a unique training in Eastern and Western thought and an analytical approach to philosophy that provided him with a background that nourished his work throughout his career. Jayatilleke was a [[Nuffield College, Oxford|Nuffield Fellow]] in the Humanities, a Fellow of the World Academy of Arts and Sciences [http://www.worldacademy.org/], Hay-Whitney-Fulbright Fellow, an editor of various philosophy journals, and was the Professor and Head of the Department of Philosophy at the [[University of Ceylon]], from 1963 until his death in 1970.

==Contributions==
Jayatilleke is best known as the author of the book ''Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge'', Perhaps the Greatest Book written by a Sri Lankan in the 20th Century &lt;ref name="EarBud"&gt;Jayatilleke, K.N. Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge. George Allen and Unwin, 1963 https://archive.org/details/EarlyBuddhistTheoryOfKnowledge&lt;/ref&gt; a work that has been described as a "masterpiece",&lt;ref name="deSilvaMP"&gt;de Silva MWP. Memorial Tribute to the Late Professor K. N. Jayatilleke. Philosophy East &amp; West, Vol 21, Number 2 (April 1971)&lt;/ref&gt; and as "an outstanding contribution to the history of Indian philosophy".&lt;ref name="EnPhil"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ninian Smart, review of Jayatilleke's Early Buddhist Theory of Knowledge, in Mind 75, no. 299 (Jul. 1966), 454.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;George Chatalian (Harvard) Jayatilleke on a concept of Meaninglessness in the Pali Nikayas. Philosophy East and West, vol, XVIII, Nos. 1 and 2, January April 1968.&lt;/ref&gt; This book traces the beginnings of ideas relating to the [[theory of knowledge]] in pre-Buddhist Indian thought and their development in early Buddhism. It consists of a comprehensive inquiry into the nature of knowledge and the questions relating to the means and limits of knowledge.&lt;ref name="EarBud"/&gt;&lt;ref name="deSilvaMP"/&gt; The book attempts to work out a general methodology for answering questions that arise in the context of profound and sophisticated philosophical discussions,&lt;ref name="deSilvaMP"/&gt; and attempts to show that the Buddha was an empiricist and verificationist who denied the meaningfulness of metaphysical utterances.  Jayatilleke describes his book as an "attempt to uncover the epistemological foundations of Pali Canonical thought, from a new point of view and in the light of new material."  His basic contentions were that early Buddhism has an empiricist outlook, gives a significant place to the [[analytic approach]] in philosophy, and does not contradict the findings of modern science.  Jayatilleke was a student of [[Ludwig Wittgenstein]], and a teacher of the famous Buddhist scholar, [[David Kalupahana]].

==Work==
Jayatilleke attempted to work out systematically the [[empiricist]] outlook in the Buddhist theory of knowledge, and to present Buddhism through the idiom, the language and methodology of the contemporary philosopher, in such a way that it would become directly relevant to the contemporary world and help in the resolution of philosophical controversies and the problems of modern man.&lt;ref name="deSilvaMP"/&gt; He emphasised that it is wrong to consider the Buddha as a mere "[[rationalist]]" philosopher, and that the [[Gautama Buddha|Buddha]] upheld the value of analytic reason rather than speculative reason. He presented three significant elements in the "new point of view" from which he discussed the thought of the [[Pali Canon]]- the empiricist outlook, the analytical approach, and the scientific attitude.  In his book, Jayatilleke cites four ways of examining philosophical questions that bring out the analytic approach in Buddhism:

* a question which ought to be explained categorically
* a question which ought to be answered with a counter question
* a question which ought to be set aside
* a question which ought to be explained analytically&lt;ref&gt;In the [[Pali canon]], these four types of questions are found, for instance, in the "Pañha Sutta" ([[Anguttara Nikaya|AN]] 4.42; see, e.g., [http://www.accesstoinsight.org/tipitaka/an/an04/an04.042.than.html Thanissaro, trans., 1992).]&lt;/ref&gt;

Jayatilleke had a great respect for modern scientific findings, and considered [[reincarnation|rebirth]] as a hypothesis capable of being scientifically verified. Apart from his basic writings in the field of epistemology, there are a number of other works. The most significant of these are "Buddhism and the race question"&lt;ref&gt;Buddhism and the Race Question by G. P. Malalasekera, K. N. Jayatilleke Review author[s]: Andrew W. Lind Philosophy East and West, Vol. 8, No. 1/2 (Apr. – Jul. 1958), pp. 68–69&lt;/ref&gt; and the Principles of International Law in Buddhist Doctrine.&lt;ref&gt;Jayatilleke, K.N.

Born to a Georgian father, of the noble family of [[Chkheidze]], and a Russian mother, Chkheidze entered the [[Imperial Russia]]n military service and fought on the side of White armies during the [[Russian Civil War|civil war]] in the [[North Caucasus]]. In 1921, as part of the defeated White [[Cossack]] forces, Chkheidze was evacuated to [[Lemnos]] whence he moved to [[Prague]], [[Czechoslovakia]], in 1923. He graduated from the Russian Faculty of Law in Prague and then lectured there. He joined the [[Eurasianists]] in the 1920s and emerged as one of their leaders in the 1930s. During [[World War II]], he was active in Russian anti-[[Nazi]] underground in Prague, but was arrested by the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] [[SMERSH]] in 1945 and placed in a [[Gulag]] camp from where he was not able to return until 1955. He was a follower of [[Nikolai Fyodorovich Fyodorov|Fyodorov]]’s philosophy and wrote on Russian society and culture as well as [[Caucasus|Caucasian]] legends and [[National delimitation in the Soviet Union|Soviet nationalities policy]]. His memoirs are a valuable first-hand account of the 1917-1955 events in Russia and the Soviet Union. He committed suicide in Prague in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;Stepanov, Nikolay.

'''Lama Foundation''' is a spiritual community founded in 1967, located in the Sangre de Cristo Mountains of northern [[New Mexico]], seventeen miles&lt;ref name="Reilly 2002 p. 16"&gt;{{cite book |last=Reilly |first=Sean |last2=O'Reilly |first2=James, |last3=O'Reilly |first3=Tim|title=The road within : true stories of transformation and the soul |publisher=Travelers' Tales Berkeley, Calif. Distributed by Publishers Group West |publication-place=San Francisco, CA, US |year=2002 |isbn=1885211848 |oclc=50638546 |page=16}}&lt;/ref&gt; north of [[Taos, New Mexico|Taos]]. The original [[commune]] was co-founded by Barbara Durkee (now known as Asha Greer or Asha von Briesen), Stephen Durkee (aka Steve Durkee, later known as [[Nooruddeen Durkee]]), and Jonathan Altman.

==Mission==
Lama Foundation's original mission was "dedicated to the awakening of consciousness, spiritual practice with respect for all traditions, service, and stewardship of the land."&lt;ref name=SNAC&gt;{{cite web|title=Lama Foundation Oral History Project|url=http://snaccooperative.org/ark:/99166/w6tv0p96|publisher=Social Networks and Archival Context Cooperative|accessdate=October 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Now the Lama Board of Trustees is an active board, ensuring that traditions are "transmitted."&lt;ref name=SNAC/&gt; Lama engages in two seasons: summer "open" season and winter "closed" season.&lt;ref name=SNAC/&gt;

First and foremost, Lama is a spiritual community dedicated to the "meeting of the ways."{{Citation needed|reason=needs additional citations for verification. |date=October 2017}} A core practice of its mission is to provide a residence for people of all spiritual and religious (and non-religious) traditions to live together and explore the common, and uncommon, ground of their spiritual practices and identities within community. This is a year-round and ever-evolving exploration. Residents live at Lama anywhere from one to several years. Unlike many spiritually-focused communities, there are no permanent residents, directors or teachers. In addition to leading a semi-monastic life, the residents are responsible for the primary care of the foundation.&lt;ref name=SNAC/&gt;

In the summer, Lama is also home to a larger group of summer stewards, or interns, who are invited into the community life for shorter periods of time. At this time, Lama welcomes visitors for as little as a day and as long as a few months.&lt;ref name=SNAC/&gt; Other "Lama Beans" who live nearby often join for day events and other visits.&lt;ref name=Romancito2017&gt;{{cite web|last=Romancito|first=Rick|title=Lama at 50|url=http://www.taosnews.com/stories/lama-at-50,41339|publisher=''[[The Taos News]]''|date=22 June 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Everyone on the land is invited into the daily practice of meditation, morning "tuning" or meeting, and weekly events like Shabbat, Zikr, Heart Club, and a variety of scheduled and impromptu events. In particular, Lama has held a Shabbat service for over 35 years which draws people from all over northern New Mexico, including travelers.{{Citation needed|reason=needs additional citations for verification. |date=October 2017}}

Lama is also a retreat center. Summer retreats are offered by a variety of teachers, and this is Lama's primary income source, providing 50% of Lama's annual operating budget.{{Citation needed|reason=needs additional citations for verification. |date=October 2017}} These programs range from meditation retreats, spiritual teachings, youth programs, permaculture certification and more.

In addition to the spiritual side of Lama, there is a strong emphasis on permaculture and right relationship to the land.&lt;ref name=Romancito2017/&gt; Gardens and good land practices help maintain an environment in keeping with the surrounding National Forest. Lama is off-grid, providing all power from solar technology, and all water is sourced from a spring on the land. Buildings are sited thoughtfully and built with natural building techniques. Food waste is composted, and all waste, as much as possible, is kept form landfills. Choices, from what to eat to whether to have gasoline-powered vehicles, are routinely considered from this perspective.

Lama holds visitors days, Shabbat, and other events for the surrounding community, which includes Taos and much of northern New Mexico. At these gatherings thousands of meals are served free of charge throughout the course of a summer.{{Citation needed|reason=needs additional citations for verification. |date=October 2017}} Thanksgiving and other events at Lama provide a place for people without family nearby to go for community at times when they need it.
[[File:Lama Foundation Dome Interior.jpg|thumb|Inside of the Dome at Lama Foundation.]]
Lama has no affiliation with any religious organization, though it maintains relationships with many. In particular, Lama has a significant relationship with the Taos Pueblo, the Hanuman Temple, Contemplative Outreach, the Church of Conscious Harmony, Ram Dass, Neem Karoli Baba, Murshid Samuel Lewis, Rabbi Zalman Schachter, Fr. Thomas Keating, St. Benedict's Monastery, the Sufi Ruhaniat International, and many others. Lama has itself become a spiritual home for thousands of individuals, in the neighborhood, across the country, and internationally.{{Citation needed|reason=needs additional citations for verification. |date=October 2017}}

==History==
The Lama Foundation was founded in 1967&lt;ref name="Sutton 2005 p. 97"&gt;{{cite book |last=Sutton |first=Robert |title=Modern American communes : a dictionary |publisher=Greenwood Press |publication-place=Westport, Conn |year=2005 |isbn=0313321817 |oclc=56894538 |page=97}}&lt;/ref&gt; by Barbara Durkee, Stephen Durkee,{{sfn |Banner |1998 |pp=173–4}} (now known as Asha Greer or Asha von Briesen and Nooruddeen Durkee), and Jonathan Altman.&lt;ref name=SNAC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Romancito2017/&gt; The Durkees had been in the communal media arts collective [[USCO]] in [[Rockland County, New York]] before moving to New Mexico.&lt;ref name="Stern2001p94–95"&gt;{{cite web|last=Stern|first=Gerd|title=Oral History: From Beat Scene Poet to Psychedelic Multimedia Artist in San Francisco and Beyond, 1948-1978|url=http://content.cdlib.org/xtf/view?docId=kt409nb28g&amp;brand=oac&amp;doc.view=entire_text|publisher=[[The Bancroft Library]]|date=2001|pages=94–95}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lama began with Altman's purchase of {{convert|100|acre|km2}} of land adjacent to federal forested land, and continues today as a place for people to visit and live.&lt;ref name=SNAC/&gt; Construction of the first buildings began in 1968.&lt;ref name=Boyle2017&gt;{{cite web|last=Boyle|first=Molly|title=A time to every purpose: Voices of Counterculture in the Southwest|url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/pasatiempo/art/museum_shows/a-time-to-every-purpose-voices-of-counterculture-in-the/article_24c3dbdf-619a-52f7-9c99-0666e16e6ea6.html|publisher=''[[Santa Fe New Mexican]]''|date=12 May 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following year, the foundation was incorporated as an "educational, religious and scientific" organization.{{Citation needed|reason=needs additional citations for verification. |date=October 2017}}

It was one of almost thirty communes ([[Intentional community|intentional communities]]) established in the region around that time, and one of the most well-known, along with [[Morningstar East]], [[Reality Construction Company]], the [[Hog Farm]], [[New Buffalo (commune)|New Buffalo]], and [[Family International|The Family]].&lt;ref name=SNAC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Boyle2017/&gt; By 1973, the vast majority of these communities had closed, but the Lama Foundation was able to continue because it had more structure and discipline than most others.{{sfn |Banner |1998 |pp=173–4}}&lt;ref name="Oliver 2004 p. 267"&gt;{{cite book |last=Oliver |first=Anna Cypra |title=Assembling my father : a daughter's detective story |publisher=Houghton Mifflin |publication-place=Boston |year=2004 |isbn=0618341528 |oclc=53919506 |page=267 |url=https://archive.org/details/assemblingmyfath00oliv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The community has gone through several stages, ranging from the search for spiritual enlightenment to a more recent focus on permaculture and natural building.&lt;ref name=Romancito2017/&gt;

[[Ram Dass]] was a friend of the founders, and he stayed at the Lama Foundation as a guest when he returned to America from India. During his visit, he presented the Durkees with a manuscript he had written, entitled ''From Bindu to Ojas''. The community's residents edited, illustrated, and laid out the text, which ultimately became a huge commercial hit when published under the name ''[[Be Here Now (book)|Be Here Now]]''.&lt;ref name=SNAC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Romancito2017/&gt;&lt;ref name=Boyle2017/&gt;{{sfn |Banner |1998 |p=176}} Ram Dass also held seminars at the Foundation.{{sfn |Banner |1998 |p=177}} So did other spiritual leaders, such as [[Samuel L. Lewis]], who was buried there after his death in 1971. In 1974 The Lama Foundation published ''[[q:Baba Hari Dass#The Yellow Book.2C 1974|The Yellow Book]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Yellow Book - The Sayings of Baba Hari Dass|last = Dass|first = Baba Hari|publisher = The Lama Foundation|year = 1974|isbn = |location = San Cristobal, NM|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; the first book of a silent master yogi [[Baba Hari Dass]], a collection of aphorisms in question/answer format about life topics.

[[File:Dances of Universal Peace.jpg|thumb|Dances of Universal Peace in the Dome.]]
Proceeds from the sales of ''Be Here Now'' helped to fund the Lama Foundation in subsequent years, as did other publications, craftwork projects such as [[prayer flags]], and a few government grants.{{sfn |Banner |1998 |p=177}}

==Architecture==
Most of the buildings are straw bale, adobe brick, and straw clay structures and were built by residents of Lama and/or participants in natural building workshops. Common structures were adobe with [[vigas]] and [[latillas]], or [[a-frame]]s – with names like "Muffin House", "Tower House", and "Orange Room". A massive forest fire in 1996 destroyed approximately 20 of the community's buildings, though the central complex survived.&lt;ref name=SNAC/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sutton 2005 p. 97"/&gt;

In 1969, Lama published [[Steve Baer]]'s ''Dome Cookbook'', and in 1972 published his reprint of [[Buckminster Fuller]]'s ''4D''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sadler|first=Simon|year=2012|title=Diagrams of Countercultural Architecture|url=|journal=Design and Culture|volume=4|issue=3|pages=345–367|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During its early days, the Lama Foundation was an early innovator within New Mexico in greenhouse design, constructing a so-called "pit greenhouse" with added heat storage to reflect biosphere principles. It permitted year-round cultivation of the community's crops.&lt;ref name="United States Congress Office of Technology Assessment 1981"&gt;{{cite web |title=An Assessment of technology for local development |publisher=Congress of the United States, Office of Technology Assessment : For sale by the Supt. of Docs., U.S. G.P.O. |year=1981 |oclc=7233599 |url=https://hdl.handle.net/2027/uc1.b4261900 |access-date=2018-05-23 |page=31}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Recently from 2012 and continuing today, CU Boulder's Environmental Design Program has been designing and building small off-grid cabin's on the Foundation to accommodate a wider range of guests as well as increased seasonal visitation capabilities. These small green cabins are a wonderful addition to not only enhance the ability of the community but also to serve as a practical design build experience for the students of the University of Colorado. Currently there are three student designed cabins that reflect sustainable architecture, cost effective construction, and vary in design schema but fit seamlessly into the fabric of the outdoor community.

==Religious practices==
The Lama Foundation is notable among communal religious movements in that it embraced an eclectic approach to spiritual discovery, rather than depending strictly on the teachings and authority of a single charismatic leader or discipline.&lt;ref name="Oliver 2004 p. 267"/&gt;{{sfn |Veysey |1978 |p=412}} In this respect, it was similar to prior movements such as [[Gerald Heard]]'s [[Trabuco College]]{{sfn |Veysey |1978 |p=412}} This individual autonomy is also displayed by the relative lack of communality in its living arrangements, compared to other groups founded at the same time.{{sfn |Veysey |1978 |pp=14, 428}}

==Current status==
[[File:The residents in 2015..jpg|thumb|The resident circle in 2015.]]
The meals at Lama are primarily, but not always, vegetarian. The electrical power comes predominantly from solar panels but is supplemented by propane as necessary.

{{More footnotes|date=October 2011}}
[[Aleister Crowley]] wrote '''The Gnostic Mass'''&amp;nbsp;— technically called Liber XV or "Book 15"&amp;nbsp;— in 1913 while travelling in [[Moscow|Moscow, Russia]]. The structure is similar to the Mass of the [[Eastern Orthodox Church]] and [[Roman Catholic Church]], communicating the principles of Crowley's [[Thelema]]. It is the central rite of [[Ordo Templi Orientis]] and its ecclesiastical arm, [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica]].

The ceremony calls for five officers: a Priest, a Priestess, a Deacon, and two acolytes, called Children (though current practice is that the part is usually performed by adults).{{Citation needed|date=July 2010}} The end of the ritual culminates in the consummation of the [[eucharist]], consisting of a goblet of wine and a [[Cake of Light]], after which the congregant proclaims “There is no part of me that is not of the gods!”

Crowley explains why he wrote the Gnostic Mass in his ''[[The Confessions of Aleister Crowley|Confessions]]'':

&lt;blockquote&gt;While dealing with this subject I may as well outline its scope completely. Human nature demands (in the case of most people) the satisfaction of the religious instinct, and, to very many, this may best be done by ceremonial means. I wished therefore to construct a ritual through which people might enter into ecstasy as they have always done under the influence of appropriate ritual. In recent years, there has been an increasing failure to attain this object, because the established cults shock their intellectual convictions and outrage their common sense. Thus their minds criticize their enthusiasm; they are unable to consummate the union of their individual souls with the universal soul as a bridegroom would be to consummate his marriage if his love were constantly reminded that its assumptions were intellectually absurd.&lt;br&gt;

I resolved that my Ritual should celebrate the sublimity of the operation of universal forces without introducing disputable metaphysical theories. I would neither make nor imply any statement about nature which would not be endorsed by the most materialistic man of science. On the surface this may sound difficult; but in practice I found it perfectly simple to combine the most rigidly rational conceptions of phenomena with the most exalted and enthusiastic celebration of their sublimity.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

==Publications of the Mass==
Crowley published the text of the Gnostic Mass three times: in 1918 in a publication called ''The International,'' in 1919 in ''The Equinox (III:1)'', and in 1929 in ''[[Magick in Theory and Practice]]''. It was privately performed while Crowley was at the [[Abbey of Thelema]] in [[Sicily|Sicily, Italy]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news

==The Temple==
There are four main pieces of furniture in a Gnostic Mass temple:

'''The High Altar''': the dimensions are {{convert|7|ft|m}} long by {{convert|3|ft|m}} wide by {{convert|44|in|mm}} high. It is covered with a crimson cloth. It is situated in the East, or in the direction of [[Boleskine House]]—Crowley's former estate—on the shores of [[Loch Ness]] in Scotland ("Temple East"). The two-tiered super-altar sits on top of the High Altar. It all holds 22 candles, the [[Stele of Revealing]], the [[Book of the Law]], the Cup, and two bunches of roses. There is room for the Paten, and the Priestess to sit.

The High Altar is contained within a great Veil, and sits on a dais with three steps. On either side of the High Altar are two pillars, countercharged in black and white.

'''The Altar of Incense''': to the West of the Dais is a black altar made of superimposed cubes.

'''The Font''': this is a small circular item which is able to contain or hold water.

'''The Tomb''': this is generally a small, enclosing space with an entrance that is covered by a veil. It should be big enough to hold the Priest, Deacon and the two Children.

==Structure==

There are six component ceremonies within the Gnostic Mass:

===The Ceremony of the Introit===

The congregation enters the temple, the Deacon presents the Law of Thelema, and the [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica#The Gnostic Creed|Gnostic Creed]] is recited. The Priestess and the Children enter from a side room. The Priestess raises the Priest from his Tomb, then purifies, consecrates, robes and crowns him.

===The Ceremony of the Rending of the Veil===

The Priestess is enthroned at the High Altar and the veil is closed. The Priest circumambulates the temple and he ascends to the veil. The officers give their orations, including the Calendar by the Deacon. The Priest then opens the veil and kneels at the High Altar.

===The Collects===

Eleven prayers addressed to the Sun, Moon, Lord, Lady, [[Saints of Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica|Gnostic Saints]], Earth, Principles, Birth, Marriage, Death, and The End.

===The Consecration of the Elements===

The preparation of the [[Cake of Light|Eucharist]].

===The Anthem===

Of the Anthem, Crowley writes in ''Confessions:''{{full citation needed|date=January 2013}}
:''During this period [i.e. around 1913] the full interpretation of the central mystery of freemasonry became clear in consciousness, and I expressed it in dramatic form in ''The Ship''. The lyrical climax is in some respects my supreme achievement in invocation; in fact, the chorus beginning: “Thou who art I beyond all I am...” seemed to me worthy to be introduced as the anthem into the Ritual of the Gnostic Catholic Church.''

===The Mystic Marriage and Consummation of the Elements===

The Eucharist is perfected and consumed. The Priest gives the final benediction. The Priest, Deacon, and Children exit. The People exit.

==The narrative of the Gnostic Mass &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.scarletwoman.org/docs/docs_mass.html The text of The Gnostic Mass]&lt;/ref&gt;==
The People enter into the ritual space, where the Deacon stands at the Altar of Incense (symbolic of [[Tiphareth]] on the [[Tree of Life]]). She takes the Book of the Law and places it on the super-altar within the great Veil, and proclaims the Law of Thelema in the name of IAO. Returning, she leads the People in the Gnostic Creed, which announces a belief (or value) in the Lord, the Sun, [[Chaos (cosmogony)|Chaos]], Air, [[Babalon]], [[Baphomet]], the [[Ecclesia Gnostica Catholica|Gnostic Catholic Church]], the communion of Saints, the Miracle of the Mass (i.e. the [[Eucharist]]), as well as confessions of their birth as incarnate beings and the eternal cycle of their individual lives.

The Virgin then enters with the two Children, and greets the People. She moves in a serpentine manner around the Altar of Incense and the Font (symbolizing the unwinding of the [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]] Serpent which is twined around the base of the spine)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; before stopping at the Tomb. She tears down the veil with her Sword, and raises the Priest to life by the power of Iron, the Sun, and the Lord. He is lustrated and consecrated with the four elements (water and earth, fire and air), and then invested with his scarlet Robe and crowned with the golden Uraeus serpent of wisdom. Finally, she gently strokes his Lance eleven times, invoking the Lord.

The Priest lifts up the Virgin and takes her to the High Altar, seating her "upon the summit of the Earth." After he purifies and consecrates her, he closes the Veil and circumambulates the temple three times, followed by the remaining officers. They take their place before the Altar of Incense, kneeling in adoration (along with all the People), while the Priest takes the first step upon the Dais before the Veil. In this symbolic crossing of the [[Abyss (religion)|Abyss]],{{failed verification|date=January 2013}} the Priest begins with his first oration, invoking [[Nuit]], the goddess of the infinite night sky. The Priestess calls to him as Nuit, enticing the Priest to ascend to her. He then takes the second step, and identifies as Hadit, the infinitely condensed center of all things&amp;nbsp;— the Fire of every star and the Life in every person. The Deacon leads the congregation to rise and he delivers the [[Calendar]]. The Priest takes his third and final step before the Veil, invoking Ra-Hoor-Khuit,{{failed verification|date=January 2013}} the Crowned and Conquering Child of the New Aeon. With his Lance, he parts the Veil, revealing the Priestess who sits (sometimes naked) upon the High Altar. He greets her with the masculine powers of Pan and she returns it with eleven kisses on the Lance. He kneels in adoration.

The Deacon then recites the eleven Collects, which include the Sun, Moon, Lord, Lady, Saints, Earth, Principles, Birth, Marriage, Death, and the End.

The Elements are then consecrated by the Virtue of the Lance, transforming the bread into the Body of God and the wine into the Blood of God. Of these, the Priest makes a symbolic offering to On, being our Lord the Sun.

The Priest and all the People then recite the Anthem, which was taken from Crowley’s allegorical play "The Ship", and represents the legend of the Third Degree of Masonry.{{failed verification|date=January 2013}}

The Priest blesses the Elements in the name of the Lord, and also states the essential function of the entire operation, which is to bestow health, wealth, strength, joy, peace, and the perpetual happiness that is the successful fulfillment of will. He breaks off a piece of one of the hosts, and, placing it on the tip of the Lance, both he and the Priestess depress it into the Cup, crying “Hriliu” (which Crowley translated as “the shrill scream of orgasm”).

The Priest entreats Baphomet—"O Lion and O Serpent"—to be "mighty among us." He then declares the Law of Thelema to the People—"Do what thou wilt shall be the whole of the Law"—who respond with "Love is the law, love under will." He finally partakes of the Eucharist with the words, "In my mouth be the essence of the life of the Sun" (with the Host) and "In my mouth be the essence of the joy of the earth" (with the Wine). He turns to the People and declares, "There is no part of me that is not of the Gods."

The People then follow in Communication, one at a time, much as the Priest did, by partaking of a whole goblet of wine and a [[Cake of Light]]. They make the same proclamation of godhood as did the Priest. Afterwards, the Priest encloses the Priestess within the Veil, and delivers the final benediction:

:+ The LORD bless you.
:+ The LORD enlighten your minds and comfort your hearts and sustain your bodies.
:+ The LORD bring you to the accomplishment of your [[true Will]]s, the [[Great Work]], the Summum Bonum, True Wisdom and Perfect Happiness.

The Priest, Deacon, and Children then retire to the Tomb and return the torn veil. The People exit.

An [[Āsana]] is a [[hatha yoga]] posture; the term is derived from the Sanskrit word for 'seat'. While many of the oldest mentioned asanas are indeed seated postures for [[meditation]], asanas may be standing, seated, arm-balances, twists, inversions, or reclining in prone or supine positions. The asanas have been given a variety of English names by competing schools of yoga.&lt;ref&gt;Murugan, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

This is a list of notable [[codex|codices]]. 

For the purposes of this compilation, as in [[philology]], a "[[codex]]" is a [[manuscript]] book published from the [[late Antiquity]] period through the [[Middle Ages]]. (The majority of the books in both the [[list of manuscripts]] and [[list of illuminated manuscripts]] are codices.) More modern works that include "codex" as part of their name are not listed here. The following codices are usually named for their most famous resting-places, such as a city or library.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="8759">'''Ludwig Crocius''' (also '''Ludovicus Crocius'''; 29 March 1586 – 7 December 1653 or 1655) was a German [[Calvinist]] minister. He was a delegate at the [[Synod of Dort]] and professor of theology and philosophy in [[Bremen]].

==Background and career==
Ludwig Crocius was born in [[Laasphe]], the son of Paul Crocius (1551–1607). He was at one time tutor to the sons of the counts of [[Nassau-Dillenburg]] and [[Wittgenstein-Berleburg]]. From 1583, he was minister and Superintendent in Laasphe. Crocius was the author of a book of Protestant martyrology ''Groß Matyrbuch und Kirchenhistorien'' (1606). [[Johann Crocius]] was his younger brother.&lt;ref name=ADB&gt;[[:de:ADB:Crocius, Ludwig]]&lt;/ref&gt; His grandfather Matthias Crocius (1479–1557) had been a minister in [[Zwickau]], and was close to [[Martin Luther]] and [[Philipp Melanchthon]].

Crocius studied at [[Herborn Academy]], and then from 1603 studied theology at the [[University of Marburg]] where he graduated M.A. in 1604. On 5 September 1607 his father died, vacating his position as preacher and inspector of the county of [[Katzenelnbogen]] in [[Langenschwalbach]]—Crocius succeeded him, but in 1608 he asked for leave from [[Moritz of Hesse-Kassel]] for further study.

Crocius went to the universities in Bremen, Marburg and Basel. On 4 April 1609, he graduated D.D. in Basel, and travelled on to Geneva, in order to study there further. From Geneva, he returned to Bremen and the St. Martini church as first preacher and teacher of philosophy and theology professor at the Gymnasium Illustre, from 1610.

[[File:Bremen 1734 Martinikirche.jpg|thumb|The St. Martini Church in Bremen in the 18th century.]]

He turned down later offers of positions made by [[John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg]] (1615) and the Landgrave Moritz of Hesse-Kassel (1618), and also a chance to become General superintendent for [[Silesia]]. From 1630 to 1639, and from 1647 to his death, he was a prorector at the High School Illustre. He corresponded with [[Samuel Hartlib]] and [[John Dury]],&lt;ref&gt;Mark Greengrass, Michael Leslie, ''Samuel Hartlib and Universal Reformation: Studies in Intellectual Communication'' (2002), p. 70; [https://books.google.com/books?id=GXYEqXxjGlwC&amp;pg=PA70 Google Books];&lt;/ref&gt; and with [[Gerardus Vossius]].&lt;ref&gt;{{ODNBweb|id=28355|title=Vossius, Gerardus Joannes|first=C. S. M.|last=Rademaker}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1651 Crocius suffered an attack of [[apoplexy]], but he remained until 14 May 1652 at his post of preacher in the Liebfrauenkirche church. He taught at the Gymnasium Illustre up to his death, which occurred in Bremen.

==Synod of Dort==
Crocius travelled to the 1618 Synod of Dort with [[Mathias Martinius]] and [[Heinrich Isselburg]]. The senate of Bremen required of its three delegates that they would represent a mild theological line going back to [[Philipp Melanchthon]], as defined in the ''Consensus Bremensis'' of 1595 and corresponds to the local practices; Bremen for prudential reasons had signed up to the [[Augsburg Confession]].

Crocius and Martinius were in the small group of Dort delegates who rejected [[limited atonement]].&lt;ref&gt;David L. Allen, Steve W. Lemke, (editors), ''Whosoever Will: A Biblical-Theological Critique of Five-Point Calvinism'' (2010), p. 67; [https://books.google.com/books?id=hlAmZlssEoYC&amp;pg=PA67 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; Crocius made a public criticism of [[Johannes Bogermann]] who chaired the Synod, for his harshness towards the [[Remonstrants]]; and gave other clear signs of sympathy with Arminian views. The Bremen representatives, nevertheless, subscribed to the [[Canons of Dort]]. In practical terms they implied no restrictions or obligations for the church in Bremen, given that the conclusions of the Synod were given no confessional standing there. This was not without consequences, for Bremen's reputation among Calvinists.&lt;ref&gt;H. J. Selderhuis, Markus Wriedt, ''Bildung und Konfession: Theologenausbildung im Zeitalter der Konfessionalisierung'' (2006), pp. 47–8; [https://books.google.com/books?id=Eh5o6eGLmNQC&amp;pg=PA47 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy==
He was attacked by the Lutheran [[Balthasar Mentzer]] in his ''Anti-Crocius'' of (1621).&lt;ref&gt;E. David Willis, Calvin's Catholic Christology, p. 22; [https://books.google.com/books?id=1M03AAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA22 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Synod of Dort the arguments over [[predestination]] resonated in Bremen. The preacher of the St. Ansgarii Church, [[Philipp Caesar]], was an advocate of the strict doctrine. Caesar preached along these lines to the local council. In 1624 he resigned his post and left Bremen, but both the St. Ansgari and St. Stephani churches strove to gain Caesar as preachers; but the appointment was rejected by the senate. Heinrich Isselburg, the preacher of the Liebfrauenkirche church, died on 29 March 1628 and it seemed that Caesar could take the vacant position. To prevent that Ludwig Crocius was appointed to the place.

Caesar then in 1628 was able to preach in the St. Martini, since this position had become free; now by the appointment. In 1630, however, Caesar again left the city, and finally converted to Catholicism. The situation in Breman resolved with Crocius, Conrad Bergius (1592-1642) at St.  Ansgarii, and Balthasar Willius (1606-1656), preacher at the Liebfrauenkirche as representatives of the moderate teachings of Melanchthon, and on the other hand the High School rector [[Johann Combach]], Henricus Flockenius at St. Remberti, and Petrus Carpenter at St. Stephani as representatives of the strict doctrine.

The debates at Dort still cast a long shadow, and in 1640, when Crocius was attacked as an [[Arminian]] by [[Hendrik Alting]] who had also participated, [[John Davenant]] and [[Joseph Hall (bishop)|Joseph Hall]] intervened in the controversy to defend him.&lt;ref&gt;Anthony Milton, ''Catholic and Reformed: The Roman and Protestant Churches in English Protestant Thought, 1600-1640'' (2002), p. 423; [https://books.google.com/books?id=stwluHDJsQgC&amp;pg=PA423 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
Crocius was classed with the [[eirenicist]] writers of his time.&lt;ref&gt;With [[Jacobus Acontius]], [[Conrad Bergius]], [[George Calixtus]], [[Franciscus Junius the Elder]], and [[David Paraeus]]. Paul Chang-Ha Lim, ''In Pursuit of Purity, Unity, and Liberty: Richard Baxter's Puritan ecclesiology in its seventeenth-century context'' (2004), p. 119; [https://books.google.com/books?id=xPirhqpQDe8C&amp;pg=PA119 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; He had a reputation as tolerant and moderate, and was on friendly terms with Calixtus at [[Helmstedt]]. His ''Antisocinismus Contractus'' (1639) attacked [[Socinian]]s on the centenary of the death of [[Fausto Sozzini]]. The work may have been intended for pedagogical use with students.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emanuel.ro/files/perichoresis/Perichoresis3.1(2005).pdf ''Reformed Antisocinianism in Northern Germany'' (PDF)], at p. 3, p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;

He translated [[Basilius]], and in 1617 published an edition of [[Ficino]]'s ''De Religione Christiana''.&lt;ref&gt;Théo Verbeek, ''Johannes Clauberg (1622-1665): and Cartesian philosophy in the seventeenth century'' (1999), p. 182; [https://books.google.com/books?id=aidBs_oq1_cC&amp;pg=PA182 Google Books].&lt;/ref&gt; He was a prolific writer, with an estimated 71 publications. ''Syntagma sacrae Theologiae'' (1636) was a major work. Others were:

*''Vier Tractaten van de Verstandicheit der Heyligen principelyk ghestelt teghens het boek P. Bertii van den Afval der Heyligen door Lud. Crocium'' (1615);
*''Homo Calvinianus impie descriptus a Dr. Matth. Hoe Austriaco'' (1620), polemical; 
*''Examen falsae descriptionis Calvinistarum Hoeji IV disputatt. defensis'' (1621); 
*''Assertio Augustanae confessionis contra Mentzerum IV disputatt.'' (1621);
* Numerous shorter works against [[Robert Bellarmine]] and the [[Jesuit]]s.&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;

He wrote on the ''[[De Germania]]'' of [[Tacitus]] (1618) as a school work, and also the ''Idea viri boni hoc est octo et quadringenta Sixti sive Xisti sententiae quae vitae honestae et religiosae epitomen complectuntur'' (1618).&lt;ref name=ADB/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2149">'''Male eggs''' are the result of a process in which the eggs of a female would be emptied of their genetic contents (a technique similar to that used in the [[cloning]] process), and those contents would be replaced with male DNA. Such eggs could then be fertilized by sperm.  The procedure was conceived by [[Calum MacKellar]], a Scottish bioethicist. With this technique, two males could be the biological parents of a child. However, such a procedure would additionally require an [[artificial womb]] or a female [[gestational carrier]].&lt;ref name="EBR"&gt;[http://www.bioethics.org.uk/2_fathrs.htm EUROPEAN BIOETHICAL RESEARCH: "CHILDREN WITH TWO GENETIC FATHERS"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070727053609/http://www.bioethics.org.uk/2_fathrs.htm |date=2007-07-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraph"&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/scienceandtechnology/science/sciencenews/4753986/Genetic-offspring-for-gays-a-possibility.html Telegraph.co.uk: "Genetic offspring for gays 'a possibility'"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="NS"&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article.ns?id=dn19 New Scientist: "Baby talk"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CBC"&gt;[http://www.cbc.ca/news/background/genetics_reproduction/timeline.html CBC news: "Timeline: Assisted reproduction and birth control"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/sci/tech/940790.stm BBC News: "Male-only conception 'highly speculative'"]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="CGS"&gt;[http://www.geneticsandsociety.org/article.php?id=3904 Center for Genetics and Society: "Are male eggs and female sperm on the horizon?"]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Marsilius of Padua''' ([[Italian language|Italian]]: ''Marsilio'' or ''Marsiglio da Padova''; born ''Marsilio dei Mainardini'' or ''Marsilio Mainardini''; c. 1275 &amp;ndash; c. 1342) was an [[Italian people|Italian]] scholar, trained in medicine,  who practiced a variety of professions. He was also an important 14th-century political figure. His political treatise ''[[Defensor pacis]]'' (The Defender of Peace), an attempt to refute papalist claims to a "plenitude of power" in affairs of both church and state, is seen by some authorities as the most revolutionary political treatise written in the later [[Middle Ages]]. It is one of the first examples of a reasoned defense of [[caesaropapism]] in Western Europe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Politicizing the Bible: The Roots of Historical Criticism and the Secularization of Scripture 1300-1700 | publisher=Herder &amp; Herder |author1=Hahn, Scott  |author2=Wiker, Benjamin |lastauthoramp=yes | year=2013 | location=Chapter 2: "The First Cracks of Secularism: Marsilius of Padua and William of Ockham" | pages=17–59 ''passim''}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==

Marsilius was born in [[Padua]], an important Italian city, circa 1275-1280. He probably studied medicine at the University of Padua&lt;ref&gt;Alan Gewirth, "Marsilius of Padua," in Paul Edwards, ed., ''The Encyclopedia of Philosophy'', vol. 5. New York: Macmillan, 1967, p. 166.&lt;/ref&gt; and later went to the [[University of Paris]], where he became a devoted admirer of Aristotle, whom he called 'the divine philosopher".&lt;ref&gt;Marsilius of Padua, ''The Defender of Peace''. Translated by Alan Gewirth. New York: Harper &amp; Row, 1967, p. 38.&lt;/ref&gt; He served as [[Rector (academia)|rector]] of the University of Paris in 1313.

==Political theory and later years==
Marsilius wrote ''Defensor pacis'' in 1324.&lt;ref name=Lee&gt;Lee, Hwa-Yong,  ''Political Representation in the Later Middle Ages: Marsilius in Context'' (New York etc., Lang, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt; This treatise was written in the context of a power struggle between [[Pope John XXII]] and [[Louis IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Louis of Bavaria]] (or Ludwig of Bavaria), the elected candidate for [[Holy Roman Emperor]]. Louis' policies in the Italian peninsula, where the Empire had important territories, threatened papal territorial sovereignty. In 1323 Louis had sent an army to Italy to protect Milan against the powerful [[Kingdom of Naples]]. Naples, along with [[France]], was a strong ally of John XXII.  John [[excommunicated]] Louis and demanded that he relinquish his claim to the imperial crown. Louis responded to John XXII with fresh provocations.

In ''Defensor pacis'', Marsilius sought to demonstrate, by arguments from [[reason]] (in ''Dictio I'' of the text) and by argument from [[authority]] (in ''Dictio II'') the independence of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] from the [[Papacy]] and the emptiness of the prerogatives alleged to have been usurped by the Roman pontiffs. A number of Marsilius's views were declared to be heretical by Pope John XXII in 1327.&lt;ref name=Lee/&gt;

Most of ''Defensor pacis'' is devoted to theology. Relying heavily on Scripture, Marsilius seeks to show that Jesus did not claim to possess any temporal power and that he did not intend his church to exercise any.&lt;ref&gt;Marsilius of Padua, ''Defensor'' ''Pacis'', pp. 113-126.&lt;/ref&gt; On the contrary, Scripture teaches that the church should be thoroughly subordinate to the state in both secular and spiritual matters. All authority in the church lies with the whole body of the faithful, the secular ruler who acts as the people's representative, and general councils called by the secular ruler.&lt;ref&gt;Marsilius of Padua, ''Defender of Peace'', Discourse II.&lt;/ref&gt; Some of Marsilius's arguments on these themes had a marked influence during the Reformation.&lt;ref name="Gewirth p. 167"&gt;Gewirth, "Marsilius of Padua," p. 167.&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, Marsilius's ''Defensor pacis'' is best remembered not for its theology but for its political philosophy and legal theory. Marsilius agrees with Aristotle that the purpose of government is the rational fulfillment of humans' natural desire for a "sufficient life".&lt;ref&gt;Marsilius of Padua, ''Defensor Pacis'', p. 13.&lt;/ref&gt; However, he goes beyond Aristotle in embracing a form of republicanism that views the people as the only legitimate source of political authority. Sovereignty lies with the people, and the people should elect, correct, and, if necessary, depose its political leaders.&lt;ref name="Gewirth p. 167"/&gt; Democracy, Marsilius argues, is the best form of government because it tends to produce the wisest laws, protects the common benefit, promotes "sufficiency of life", and produces laws that are most likely to be obeyed.&lt;ref&gt;Marsilius of Padua, ''The Defender of Peace'', pp. 46-47.&lt;/ref&gt;

Marsilius and [[John of Jandun]], who has sometimes been credited as a co-author of ''Defensor pacis'', left France for Louis' [[Alter Hof|court]] in [[Duchy of Bavaria|Bavaria]]. Louis admitted Marsilius and John to his circle. Others were also under his protection, including  [[Michael of Cesena]] and the philosopher [[William of Ockham]], an advocate of an early form of church and state separation. In 1326, Marsilius accompanied Louis to Italy, where he preached or circulated written attacks against the pope.  The Lord of Milan [[Galeazzo I Visconti]], suspected of conspiring with John XXII, was deposed and Louis was crowned King of Italy in [[Milan]] in 1327.

In January 1328 Louis entered [[Rome]] and had himself crowned emperor by the aged senator [[Sciarra Colonna]], called ''captain of the Roman people''. Three months later, Louis published a decree declaring "Jacque de Cahors"&amp;mdash;Pope John XXII&amp;mdash;deposed on grounds of [[heresy]]. He then installed the [[Franciscan]] [[Pietro Rainalducci]] as [[Antipope Nicholas V|Nicholas V]]. Nicholas was deposed upon Louis's departure from Rome in 1329.

In Bavaria, as imperial vicar, Marsilius persecuted the clergy who had remained faithful to John XXII. In recompense for his services, he was appointed [[archbishop of Milan]],&lt;ref&gt;{{CathEncy|wstitle=Marsilius of Padua}}&lt;/ref&gt; and John of Jandun obtained from Louis IV the [[bishopric of Ferrara]].

Marsilius also composed a treatise ''De translatione [Romani] imperii'', which some authorities consider is a rearrangement of a similar work by [[Landolfo Colonna]] called ''De jurisdictione imperatoris in causa matrimoniali''. This work, and Marsilius's variation, sought to justify the exclusive jurisdiction of the emperor in matrimonial affairs: Louis of Bavaria had recently annulled the marriage of the son of the King of Bohemia.

==Death==
Marsilius died in [[Munich]] around 1342, still unreconciled to the Church.

==Legacy==
Some authorities consider ''Defensor pacis'' one of the most important political and religious works of fourteenth-century [[Europe]]. In the ''[[Defensor minor]]'', Marsilius completed and elaborated on different points in the doctrine laid down in the ''Defensor pacis''. He dealt here with problems concerning ecclesiastical jurisdiction, [[penance]], [[indulgence]]s, [[crusade]]s and [[pilgrimage]]s, vows, [[excommunication]], the general church council, marriage and divorce, and unity with the [[Greek Orthodox Church]]. In this work he even more clearly articulates imperial supremacy over the Church.&lt;ref&gt;Lee, Hwa-Yong, ''Political Representation in the Later Middle Ages: Marsilius in Context'' (New York etc., Lang, 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

He went to [[Telangana]] in Andhra Pradesh in the early 1990s, living with the [[Naxalite]]s and trying to understand their movement.&lt;ref name=Hindu20021111/&gt;

Chandrankunnel studied physics and philosophy in several Indian universities.&lt;ref name=self/&gt;
In 1998 he earned a PhD in Philosophy of Science from the [[Katholieke Universiteit Leuven|University of Leuven]] in Belgium.&lt;ref name=mattersindia201621/&gt;
He worked under [[Aage Bohr]], [[Carl Friedrich von Weizsäcker]] and [[Ilya Prigogine]] in developing his thesis, which compared the interpretations of [[Niels Bohr]] and of [[David Bohm]].&lt;ref name=Hindu20021111/&gt;
He did post-doctoral research at the [[Harvard–Smithsonian Center for Astrophysics]], and lectured at the [[State University of New York]].&lt;ref name=Chaavara/&gt;
In July 2000 he won the Science and Religion Course Award from the Centre for Theology and Natural Sciences in [[Berkeley, California]] for his contribution: ''"Search for Unity and Interconnectedness: Meeting Point between Science and Religion"''.&lt;ref name=Hindu20021111/&gt;

==Later career==

Chandrankunnel is a founder of the Bangalore Forum for Science and Religion.&lt;ref name=Chaavara/&gt;
He was a founding member in 2001 of the [[Bangalore Initiative for Religious Dialogue]], which attempts to defuse tensions between religious communities such as Hindus, Christians and Muslims.
He was the Indian co-ordinator for the Science-Religion Summit in [[Bangalore]] in 2003.&lt;ref name=Hindu20021111/&gt;
He organised the conference "Merging Boundaries: Mysticism, Science and Religion", inaugurated by Sri [[Ravi Shankar]]. 
He has worked as science editor of [[Deepika (newspaper)|Deepika]] daily newspaper and as its Chennai and Bangalore correspondent.&lt;ref name=self/&gt; 

A group of Indian Christians issued a letter on 1 January 2007 to various world leaders entitled ''A Campaign Declaration: Bangalore Initiative for Religious Dialogue (BIRD)''.
Chandrankunnel was one of the signatories. 
The group asserted that the 1977 ruling by India's Supreme Court that a citizen had the right to "profess, practice and propagate" ones religion does not include the right to convert another.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}{{dead link|date=January 2018 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
The group called for a change to Article 18 of the [[Universal Declaration of Human Rights]] to prohibit conversion through material incentives, coercion, threats or intimidation. 
However, the BIRD members affirmed the [[Great Commission]] that "unequivocally calls us to witness to Christ in a pluralistic setting".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Eckhart von Hochheim''' {{post-nominals|post-noms=[[Order of Preachers|OP]]}} ({{circa|1260}} – {{circa|1328}}),&lt;ref&gt;[https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/sum2011/entries/meister-eckhart/ Mojsisch, Burkhard and Summerell, Orrin F., "Meister Eckhart", ''The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy'' (Summer 2011 Edition), Edward N. Zalta (ed.)]&lt;/ref&gt; commonly known as '''Meister Eckhart'''{{efn|Pronounced [{{IPA|ˈmaɪ̯stɐ ˈɛkʰaʀt}}].}} or '''Eckehart''', was a German [[theology|theologian]], [[philosopher]] and [[German mysticism|mystic]], born near [[Gotha (town)|Gotha]], in the [[Thuringia|Landgraviate of Thuringia]] (now central Germany) in the [[Holy Roman Empire]].{{efn|''Meister'' is German for "Master", referring to the academic title ''Magister in theologia'' that he obtained in Paris.}}

Eckhart came into prominence during the [[Avignon Papacy]], at a time of increased tensions between monastic orders, diocesan clergy, the [[Franciscan]] Order, and Eckhart's [[Dominican Order]] of Preachers. In later life, he was accused of heresy and brought up before the local Franciscan-led [[Inquisition]], and tried as a [[heresy|heretic]] by [[Pope John XXII]].{{efn|His "Defence" is famous for his reasoned arguments to all challenged articles of his writing, and his refutation of heretical intent.}} He seems to have died before his verdict was received.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}{{efn|No record of his death or burial site has ever been discovered.}}

He was well known for his work with pious lay groups such as the [[Friends of God]] and was succeeded by his more circumspect disciples [[John Tauler]] and [[Henry Suso]].{{Citation needed|date=February 2010}} Since the 19th century, he has received renewed attention. He has acquired a status as a great mystic within contemporary popular [[spirituality]], as well as considerable interest from scholars situating him within the medieval scholastic and philosophical tradition.{{sfn|Hackett|2012}}

==Biography==
Eckhart was probably born in the village of [[Tambach-Dietharz|Tambach]], near [[Gotha]], in the [[Thuringia|Landgraviate of Thuringia]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Bernard McGinn (theologian)|Bernard McGinn]], ''The Mystical Thought of Meister Eckhart'', (New York: Crossroad Publishing Company, 2001), p.2, points out that previous scholarship which had placed Eckhart's birth in Hochheim is incorrect: Hochheim is used in the sources to indicate Eckhart's family name, not his birthplace.&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps between 1250 and 1260.&lt;ref&gt;Walter Senner, ‘Meister Eckhart’s Life, Training, Career, and Trial’ in Jeremiah Hackett (ed.), A Companion to Meister Eckhart (Leiden: Brill, 2012), 7–84.&lt;/ref&gt; It was previously asserted that he was born to a noble family of landowners, but this originated in a misinterpretation of the archives of the period.&lt;ref&gt;''Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense'', trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.5.&lt;/ref&gt; In reality, little is known about his family and early life. There is no authority for giving him the Christian name of '''Johannes''', which sometimes appears in biographical sketches:&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Cairns |first=Earl |title=Christianity through the Centuries |year=1996 |publisher=Zondervan }}&lt;/ref&gt; his Christian name was '''Eckhart'''; his surname was '''von&amp;nbsp;Hochheim'''.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Clark |first=James |title=Meister Eckhart |year=1957 |publisher=Thomas Nelson and Sons Ltd. |location=New York |page=11}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Church career===
[[File:Predigerkloster Erfurt.jpg|thumb|left|Predigerkirche]]
Eckhart joined the Dominicans at [[Erfurt]], probably when he was about eighteen, and it is assumed he studied at [[Cologne]].&lt;ref&gt;This supposition is founded on Eckhart’s frequent citation, with respect, of Albert the Great, who had taught at Cologne until his death in 1280, and more particularly, his statement in his 1294 Easter Sermon that "Albert often used to say: 'This I know, as we know things, for we all know very little.{{'"}} ([[Bernard McGinn (theologian)|Bernard McGinn]], ''The Mystical Thought of Meister Eckhart'' (New York: Crossroad Publishing Company, 2001), p.2.)&lt;/ref&gt; He may have also studied at the University of Paris, either before or after his time in Cologne.&lt;ref&gt;The evidence for Eckhart's studies in Cologne is similarly circumstantial as recounted in ''Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense'', trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.7.&lt;/ref&gt;

The first solid evidence we have for his life is when on 18&amp;nbsp;April 1294, as a ''baccalaureus'' (lecturer) on the ''[[Sentences]]'' of [[Peter Lombard]], a post to which he had presumably been appointed in 1293, he preached the Easter Sermon (the ''Sermo Paschalis'') at the Dominican convent of St.&amp;nbsp;Jacques in Paris. In late 1294, Eckhart was made [[Prior]] at Erfurt and [[Provincial superior|Provincial]] of Thuringia. His earliest vernacular work, ''Reden der Unterweisung'' (''The Talks of Instructions''/''Counsels on Discernment''), a series of talks delivered to Dominican novices, dates from this time (c.&amp;nbsp;1295–1298).&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, ''Eckhart'', p.4&lt;/ref&gt; In 1302, he was sent to Paris to take up the external Dominican chair of theology. He remained there until 1303. The short ''Parisian Questions'' date from this time.&lt;ref&gt;The ''Parisian Questions'' were first discovered in 1927. They are translated with an introduction in Armand Maurer, ed., ''Master Eckhart: Parisian Questions and Prologues'', (Toronto: Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, 1974).&lt;/ref&gt;

In late 1303 Eckhart returned to Erfurt, and was made [[Provincial superior|Provincial]] for [[Duchy of Saxony|Saxony]], a province which reached at that time from the Netherlands to [[Livonia]]. He therefore had responsibility for forty-seven convents in this region. Complaints made against him and the provincial of Teutonia at the general chapter held in Paris in 1306, concerning irregularities among the ternaries, must have been trivial, because the general, [[Aymeric of Piacenza]], appointed him in the following year his vicar-general for [[Bohemia]] with full power to set the demoralized monasteries there in order. Eckhart was Provincial for Saxony until 1311, during which time he founded three convents for women there.&lt;ref&gt;On the possible dating of the works written in this period, see McGinn, ''Eckhart'', pp.5–9.&lt;/ref&gt;

On 14 May 1311 Eckhart was appointed by the general chapter held at [[Naples]] as teacher at Paris. To be invited back to Paris for a second stint as ''magister'' was a rare privilege, previously granted only to [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, ''Eckhart'', p.9&lt;/ref&gt; Eckhart stayed in Paris for two academic years, until the summer of 1313, living in the same house as [[William of Paris (inquisitor)|William of Paris]].

Then follows a long period of which it is known only that he spent part of the time at [[Strasbourg]].&lt;ref&gt;cf. ''Urkundenbuch der Stadt Strassburg'', iii.&amp;nbsp;236.&lt;/ref&gt; It is unclear what specific office he held there: he seems chiefly to have been concerned with spiritual direction and with preaching in convents of Dominicans.&lt;ref name="McGinn-p10"&gt;''Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense'', trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.10.&lt;/ref&gt;

A passage in a chronicle of the year 1320, extant in manuscript (cf. [[Wilhelm Preger]], i.&amp;nbsp;352–399), speaks of a prior Eckhart at [[Frankfurt]] who was suspected of heresy, and some have referred this to Meister Eckhart. It is unusual that a man under suspicion of heresy would have been appointed teacher in one of the most famous schools of the order, but Eckhart's distinctive expository style could well have already been under scrutiny by his Franciscan detractors.

In late 1323 or early 1324, Eckhart left Strasbourg for the Dominican house at Cologne. It is not clear exactly what he did here, though part of his time may have been spent teaching at the prestigious ''Studium'' in the city. Eckhart also continued to preach, addressing his sermons during a time of disarray among the clergy and monastic orders, rapid growth of numerous pious lay groups, and the [[Inquisition]]'s continuing concerns over heretical movements throughout Europe.

It appears that some of the Dominican authorities already had concerns about Eckhart's teaching. The Dominican General Chapter held in Venice in the spring of 1325 had spoken out against "friars in Teutonia who say things in their sermons that can easily lead simple and uneducated people into error".&lt;ref name="McGinn-p14"&gt;McGinn, ''Eckhart'', (2001), p.14&lt;/ref&gt; This concern (or perhaps concerns held by the archbishop of Cologne, [[Heinrich II of Virneburg|Henry of Virneburg]]) may have been why [[Nicholas of Strasbourg]], to whom the pope had in 1325 given the temporary charge of the Dominican monasteries in Germany, conducted an investigation of Eckhart's orthodoxy. Nicholas presented a list of suspect passages from the ''Book of Consolation'' to Eckhart, who responded sometime between August 1325 and January 1326 with a lost treatise ''Requisitus'', which satisfied his immediate superiors of his orthodoxy.&lt;ref name="McGinn-p14" /&gt; Despite this assurance, however, the archbishop in 1326 ordered an inquisitorial process.&lt;ref name="McGinn-p10" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Preger"&gt;cf. the document in Preger, i.&amp;nbsp;471; more accurately in ''ALKG'', ii.&amp;nbsp;627 sqq.&lt;/ref&gt; At this point he issued a ''Vindicatory Document'', providing chapter and verse of what he had been taught.&lt;ref&gt;In the early twentieth century, the suspicion of Eckhart was often put down to tensions between Dominicans and Franciscans. This narrative, however, has been replaced by one which emphasises the broader context of fears concerning the Heresy of the Free Spirit. See Bernard McGinn, ''The Harvest of Mysticism'', (2005), p.103.&lt;/ref&gt;

Throughout the difficult months of late 1326, Eckhart had the full support of the local Dominican authorities, as evident in Nicholas of Strasbourg's three official protests against the actions of the inquisitors in January 1327.&lt;ref name="McGinn-p.17"&gt;McGinn, ''Eckhart'', (2001), p.17&lt;/ref&gt; On 13&amp;nbsp;February 1327, before the archbishop's inquisitors pronounced their sentence on Eckhart, Eckhart preached a sermon in the Dominican church at Cologne, and then had his secretary read out a public protestation of his innocence. He stated in his protest that he had always detested everything wrong, and should anything of the kind be found in his writings, he now retracts. Eckhart himself translated the text into German, so that his audience, the vernacular public, could understand it. The verdict then seems to have gone against Eckhart. Eckhart denied competence and authority to the inquisitors and the archbishop, and appealed to the Pope against the verdict.&lt;ref name="Preger" /&gt; He then, in the spring of 1327, set off for [[Avignon]].

In Avignon, [[Pope John XXII]] seems to have set up two tribunals to inquire into the case, one of theologians and the other of cardinals.&lt;ref name="McGinn-p.17"/&gt; Evidence of this process is thin. However, it is known that the commissions reduced the 150 suspect articles down to 28; the document known as the ''Votum Avenionense'' gives, in scholastic fashion, the twenty-eight articles, Eckhart's defence of each, and the rebuttal of the commissioners.&lt;ref name="McGinn-p.17" /&gt; On 30&amp;nbsp;April 1328, the pope wrote to Archbishop Henry of Virneburg that the case against Eckhart was moving ahead, but added that Eckhart had already died (modern scholarship suggests he may have died on 28&amp;nbsp;January 1328).&lt;ref&gt;The general assumption in modern scholarship on Eckhart has been that the date of Eckhart's death is lost. McGinn, ''Eckhart'', (2001), p.17, however, trusts the argument of Walter Senner that a seventeenth-century Dominican source noted that Eckhart was remembered in German convents on 28&amp;nbsp;January&amp;nbsp;– suggesting this day in 1328 was the date of his death. Some early twentieth-century writers suggested Eckhart may have not in fact died, but continued his ministry in anonymity, but there is no single medieval source that supports this suspicion.&lt;/ref&gt; The papal commission eventually confirmed (albeit in modified form) the decision of the Cologne commission against Eckhart.&lt;ref name="McGinn-p10" /&gt;

[[Pope John XXII]] issued a bull (''In agro dominico''), 27&amp;nbsp;March 1329, in which a series of statements from Eckhart is characterized as heretical, another as suspected of heresy.&lt;ref&gt;The bull is given complete in ''ALKG'', ii.&amp;nbsp;636–640).&lt;/ref&gt; At the close, it is stated that Eckhart recanted before his death everything which he had falsely taught, by subjecting himself and his writing to the decision of the [[Apostolic See]]. It is possible that the Pope's unusual decision to issue the bull, despite the death of Eckhart (and the fact that Eckhart was not being personally condemned as a heretic), was due to the pope's fear of the growing problem of mystical heresy, and pressure from his ally Henry&amp;nbsp;II to bring the case to a definite conclusion.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, ''Eckhart'', (2001), p.18.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rehabilitation===
Eckhart's status in the contemporary Catholic Church has been uncertain. The Dominican Order pressed in the last decade of the 20th century for his full rehabilitation and confirmation of his theological orthodoxy. [[Pope John Paul II]] voiced favorable opinion on this initiative, even going as far as quoting from Eckhart's writings, but the affair is still confined to the corridors of the [[Vatican City|Vatican]]. In the spring of 2010, it was revealed that there was finally a response from the Vatican in a letter dated 1992. [[Timothy Radcliffe]], then Master of the Dominicans and recipient of the letter, summarized the contents as follows:
{{quote|We tried to have the censure lifted on Eckhart [...] and were told that there was really no need since he had never been condemned by name, just some propositions which he was supposed to have held, and so we are perfectly free to say that he is a good and orthodox theologian.&lt;ref name="rehab"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.academici.com/blog/7263/meister_eckhart_rehabilitated_by_the_pope.html |title=Meister Eckhart rehabilitated by the Pope |publisher=Academici.com |date= |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Professor Winfried Trusen of Würzburg, a correspondent of Radcliffe, wrote in part of a defence of Eckhart to Cardinal Ratzinger (later [[Pope Benedict XVI]]), stating
{{quote|Only 28 propositions were censured, but they were taken out of their context and impossible to verify, since there were no manuscripts in Avignon.&lt;ref name="rehab"/&gt;}}

==Influences==
{{Expand section|date=July 2017}}

Eckhart was schooled in medieval [[scholasticism]] and was well-acquainted with [[Aristotelianism]], Augustinianism, and [[Neoplatonism|Neo-Platonism]].

==Teachings==

===Sermons===
Although he was an accomplished academic theologian, Eckhart's best-remembered works are his highly unusual sermons in the vernacular. Eckhart as a preaching friar attempted to guide his flock, as well as monks and nuns under his jurisdiction, with practical sermons on spiritual/psychological transformation and New Testament metaphorical content related to the creative power inherent in disinterest (dispassion or detachment).{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The central theme of Eckhart's German sermons is the presence of God in the individual soul, and the dignity of the soul of the just man. Although he elaborated on this theme, he rarely departed from it. In one sermon, Eckhart gives the following summary of his message:{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
{{quote|When I preach, I usually speak of detachment and say that a man should be empty of self and all things; and secondly, that he should be reconstructed in the simple good that God is; and thirdly, that he should consider the great aristocracy which God has set up in the soul, such that by means of it man may wonderfully attain to God; and fourthly, of the purity of the divine nature.&lt;ref&gt;Marcus Braybrooke, ''Beacons of Light: 100 People who Have Shaped The History of Humankind'', pp.&amp;nbsp;316–317 (O&amp;nbsp;Books, 2009). {{ISBN|978-1-84694-185-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As Eckhart said in his trial defence, his sermons were meant to inspire in listeners the desire above all to do some good.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}} In this, he frequently used unusual language or seemed to stray from the path of orthodoxy, which made him suspect to the [[Catholic Church|Church]] during the tense years of the Avignon Papacy.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===Theology===
In Eckhart's vision, [[God]] is primarily [[fecund]]. Out of overabundance of love the fertile God gives birth to the [[Son]], the [[Logos|Word]] in all of us. Clearly,{{efn|Aside from a rather striking metaphor of "fertility"}} this is rooted in the Neoplatonic notion of "ebullience; boiling over" of the One that cannot hold back its abundance of Being. Eckhart had imagined the creation not as a "compulsory" overflowing (a metaphor based on a common [[hydrodynamics|hydrodynamic]] picture), but as the free act of will of the [[Trinity|triune]] nature of Deity (refer [[Trinitarianism]]).

Another bold assertion is Eckhart's distinction between God and [[Godhead (Christianity)|Godhead]] (''Gottheit'' in German, meaning Godhood or Godliness, state of being God). These notions had been present in [[Pseudo-Dionysius]]'s writings and [[Johannes Scotus Eriugena|John the Scot]]'s ''De divisione naturae'', but Eckhart, with characteristic vigor and audacity, reshaped the germinal metaphors into profound images of polarity between the Unmanifest and Manifest Absolute.

===Contemplative method===
John Orme Mills notes that Eckhart did not "leave us a guide to the spiritual life like St Bonaventure’s Itinerarium – the Journey of the Soul," but that his ideas on this have to be condensed from his "couple of very short books on suffering and detachment" and sermons.&lt;ref name="Mills"&gt;John Orme Mills, [http://www.eckhartsociety.org/resources/meister-eckhart-and-prayer-setting-scene ''Meister Eckhart and Prayer''], Eckhart Society&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mills, Eckhart's comments on prayer are only about [[contemplative prayer]] "detachment."&lt;ref name="Mills"/&gt;

==Influence and study==

===13th century===
Eckhart was one of the most influential 13th-century Christian [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonist]]s in his day, and remained widely read in the later Middle Ages.&lt;ref&gt;As McGinn, ''Eckhart'', p.1, points out, about three hundred manuscripts containing Eckhart's German sermons, both authentic and pseudonymous, survive.&lt;/ref&gt; Some early twentieth-century writers believed that Eckhart's work was forgotten by his fellow Dominicans soon after his death. In 1960, however, a manuscript ("in agro dominico") was discovered containing six hundred excerpts from Eckhart, clearly deriving from an original made in the Cologne Dominican convent ''after'' the promulgation of the bull condemning Eckhart's writings, as notations from the bull are inserted into the manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;''Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense'', trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.19.&lt;/ref&gt; The manuscript came into the possession of the Carthusians in Basel, demonstrating that some Dominicans and Carthusians had continued to read Eckhart's work.

It is also clear that [[Nicholas of Cusa]], Archbishop of Cologne in the 1430s and 1440s, engaged in extensive study of Eckhart. He assembled, and carefully annotated, a surviving collection of Eckhart's Latin works.&lt;ref&gt;''Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense'', trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.20.&lt;/ref&gt; As Eckhart was the only medieval theologian tried before the Inquisition as a heretic, the subsequent (1329) condemnation of excerpts from his works cast a shadow over his reputation for some, but followers of Eckhart in the lay group [[Friends of God]] existed in communities across the region and carried on his ideas under the leadership of such priests as John Tauler and [[Henry Suso]].&lt;ref&gt;''Christianity through the Centuries'', Earle E. Cairns, [[Zondervan]], 1996&lt;/ref&gt;

===Johannes Tauler and Rulman Merswin===
Eckhart is considered by some to have been the inspirational [[The Friend of God from the Oberland|"layman"]] referred to in [[Johannes Tauler]]'s and [[Rulman Merswin]]'s later writings in Strasbourg where he is known to have spent time (although it is doubtful that he authored the simplistic "Book of the Nine Rocks" published by Merswin and attributed to the layman knight from the north). On the other hand, most scholars consider the "layman" to be a pure fiction invented by Merswin to hide his authorship because of the intimidating tactics of the Inquisition at the time.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

===''Theologia Germanica'' and the Reformation===
It has been suspected that his practical communication of the mystical path is behind the influential 14th-century "anonymous" ''[[Theologia Germanica]]'', which was disseminated after his disappearance. According to the medieval introduction of the document, its author was an unnamed member of the [[Teutonic Knights|Teutonic Order]] of Knights living in Frankfurt.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The lack of [[imprimatur]] from the Church and anonymity of the author of the ''Theologia Germanica'' did not lessen its influence for the next two centuries&amp;nbsp;– including [[Martin Luther]] at the peak of public and clerical resistance to Catholic [[indulgences]]&amp;nbsp;– and was viewed by some historians of the early 20th century as pivotal in provoking Luther's actions and the subsequent [[Protestant Reformation]].{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

The following quote from the ''Theologia Germanica'' depicts the conflict between worldly and ecclesiastical affairs:{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}
{{quote|The two eyes of the soul of man cannot both perform their work at once: but if the soul shall see with the right eye into eternity, then the left eye must close itself and refrain from working, and be as though it were dead. For if the left eye be fulfilling its office toward outward things, that is holding converse with time and the creatures; then must the right eye be hindered in its working; that is, in its contemplation. Therefore, whosoever will have the one must let the other go; for 'no man can serve two masters.'"&lt;ref&gt;''[http://www.ccel.org/ccel/anonymous/theologia.html Theologia Germanica]'', public domain&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Obscurity===
Eckhart was largely forgotten from the sixteenth to the nineteenth centuries, barring occasional interest from thinkers such as [[Angelus Silesius]] (1627–1677).&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, ''Eckhart'', p.1&lt;/ref&gt; For centuries, none of Eckhart's writings were known except a number of [[sermon]]s, found in the old editions of [[Johann Tauler]]'s sermons, published by Kachelouen (Leipzig, 1498) and by Adam Petri (Basel, 1521 and 1522).

===Rediscovery===
Interest in Eckhart's works was revived in the early nineteenth century, especially by German Romantics and [[German idealism|Idealist]] philosophers.&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, ''Eckhart'', p.1.&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxvii}}{{efn|[[Franz von Baader]] (1765–1841), for instance, studied Eckhart in the early 19th century.{{sfn|Ffytche|2011|p=33}} Von Baader] was a German [[Roman Catholic]] philosopher and theologian. He studied under [[Abraham Gottlob Werner]] at [[Freiberg, Saxony|Freiberg]], travelled through several of the mining districts in north Germany, and for four years, 1792–1796, resided in England. There he became acquainted with the ideas of [[David Hume]], [[David Hartley (philosopher)|David Hartley]] and [[William Godwin]], which were all distasteful to him. But he also came into contact with the mystical speculations of Meister Eckhart, [[Louis Claude de Saint-Martin]] (1743–1803), and above all those of [[Jakob Boehme]], which were more to his liking. In 1796 he returned from England, and came into contact with [[Friedrich Schelling]], and the works he published during this period were manifestly influenced by that philosopher.}} [[Franz Pfeiffer]]'s publication in 1857 of Eckhart's German sermons and treatises added greatly to this interest.&lt;ref&gt;This was in the second volume of his ''Deutsche Mystiker'' ([[Stuttgart]]). Pfeiffer's edition included 111 sermons and 18 treatises, as well as a number of sayings and fragments&amp;nbsp;– but many of these are now recognised to be later works falsely attributed to Eckhart. (''Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense'', trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.62)&lt;/ref&gt;

A second important figure in the later nineteenth century for the recovery of Eckhart's works was [[Heinrich Seuse Denifle]], who was the first to recover Eckhart's Latin works, from 1886 onwards.&lt;ref&gt;Mention could also be made of Franz Jostes, ''Meister Eckhart und seine Junger, ungedruckte Texte zur Geschichte der deutschen Mystik'' (''Collectanea Friburgensia'', iv., [[Freiburg]], 1895).&lt;/ref&gt;

During the late nineteenth and early twentieth century, much Catholic interest in Eckhart was concerned with the consistency of his thought in relation to [[Neo-Scholasticism|Neoscholastic]] thought&amp;nbsp;– in other words, to see whether Eckhart's thought could be seen to be essentially in conformity with orthodoxy as represented by his fellow Dominican [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;McGinn, ''Eckhart'', p.20.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Attribution of works===
Since the mid-nineteenth century scholars have questioned which of the many pieces attributed to Eckhart should be considered genuine, and whether greater weight should be given to works written in the vernacular, or Latin. Although the vernacular works survive today in over 200 manuscripts, the Latin writings are only found in a handful of manuscripts. Denifle and others have proposed that the Latin treatises, which Eckhart prepared for publication very carefully, were essential to a full understanding of Eckhart.&lt;ref&gt;''Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense'', trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.62.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1923, Eckhart's ''Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense'' (also known as the ''Rechtsfertigung'', or ''Vindicatory Document'') was re-published. The ''Defense'' recorded Eckhart's responses against two of the Inquisitional proceedings brought against him at Cologne, and details of the circumstances of Eckhart's trial. The excerpts in the ''Defense'' from vernacular sermons and treatises described by Eckhart as his own, served to authenticate a number of the vernacular works.&lt;ref&gt;''Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense'', trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.63.&lt;/ref&gt; Although questions remain about the authenticity of some vernacular works, there is no dispute about the genuine character of the Latin texts presented in the critical edition.&lt;ref&gt;''Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense'', trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.64.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Eckhart as a mystic===
Since the 1960s debate has been going on in Germany whether Eckhart should be called a "mystic".{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxii}} The philosopher [[Karl Albert]] had already argued that Eckhart had to be placed in the tradition of philosophical mysticism of [[Parmenides]], [[Plato]], [[Plotinus]], [[Porphyry (philosopher)|Porphyry]], [[Proclus]] and other [[Neoplatonism|neo-Platonistic]] thinkers.{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxiii}} Heribert Fischer argued in the 1960s that Eckhart was a mediaeval theologian.{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxiii}}

[[Kurt Flasch]], a member of the so-called Bochum-school of mediaeval philosophy,{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxiii}} strongly reacted against the influence of New Age mysticism and "all kinds of emotional subjective mysticism", arguing for the need to free Eckhart from "the Mystical Flood".{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxiii}} He sees Eckhart strictly as a philosopher. Flasch argues that the opposition between "mystic" and "scholastic" is not relevant because this mysticism (in Eckhart's context) is penetrated by the spirit of the [[Scholasticism|University]], in which it occurred.{{citation needed|date=April 2013}}

According to Hackett, Eckhart is to be understood as an "original hermeneutical thinker in the Latin tradition".{{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxiii}} To understand Eckhart, he has to be properly placed within the western philosophical tradition of which he was a part. {{sfn|Hackett|2012|p=xxiv}}

[[Josiah Royce]], an [[Objective idealism|objective idealist]], saw Eckhart as a representative example of 13th and 14th century Catholic mystics "on the verge of pronounced heresy" but without original philosophical opinions. Royce attributes Eckhart's reputation for originality to the fact that he translated scholastic philosophy from Latin into German, and that Eckhart wrote about his speculations in German instead of Latin.&lt;ref name="Royce1898"&gt;{{cite book|last=Royce|first=Josiah|author-link=Josiah Royce|chapter=Meister Eckhart|pages=261–297|title=Studies of good and evil : a series of essays upon problems of philosophy and life|year=1898|location=New York|publisher=D. Appleton|oclc=271174795|url=https://archive.org/details/studiesgoodande02roycgoog}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|pages=262, 265–266}} Eckhart generally followed [[Thomas Aquinas]]'s doctrine of the Trinity, but Eckhart exaggerated the scholastic distinction between the divine essence and the divine persons. The very heart of Eckhart's speculative mysticism, according to Royce, is that if, through what is called in Christian terminology the procession of the Son, the divine omniscience gets a complete expression in eternal terms, still there is even at the centre of this omniscience the necessary mystery of the divine essence itself, which neither generates nor is generated, and which is yet the source and fountain of all the divine. The Trinity is, for Eckhart, the revealed God and the mysterious origin of the Trinity is the Godhead, the absolute God.&lt;ref name="Royce1898" /&gt;{{rp|pages=279–282}}

==Modern popularisation==

===Theology===

====Matthew Fox====
[[Matthew Fox (priest)|Matthew Fox]] (born 1940) is an American [[theology|theologian]].&lt;ref name="paper"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.thepeterboroughexaminer.com/ArticleDisplay.aspx?e=1467657 |title=Peterborough |work=Peterborough Examiner |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Formerly a priest and a member of the [[Dominican Order]] within the [[Roman Catholic Church]], Fox was an early and influential exponent of a movement that came to be known as [[Matthew Fox (priest)#Creation Spirituality|Creation Spirituality]]. The movement draws inspiration from the wisdom traditions of Christian scriptures, and the philosophies of such medieval Catholic visionaries as [[Hildegard of Bingen]], [[Thomas Aquinas]], [[Saint Francis of Assisi]], [[Julian of Norwich]], [[Dante Alighieri]], Meister Eckhart and [[Nicholas of Cusa]], and others. Fox has written a number of articles on Eckhart,{{citation needed|date=February 2014}} and a book titled "Breakthrough: Meister Eckhart's Creation Spirituality in New Translation."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Eckhart |first=Meister |others=Translated by Matthew Fox |date=1980 |title=Breakthrough, Meister Eckhart's creation spirituality, in new translation |url=http://www.worldcat.org/oclc/6555678 |location=Garden City, N.Y. |publisher=Doubleday |isbn=0385170459  |accessdate=September 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern philosophy===
The French philosopher [[Jacques Derrida]] distinguishes Eckhart's Negative Theology from his own concept of ''différance'' although John D. Caputo in his influential 'The Tears and Prayers of Jacques Derrida' emphasises the importance of that tradition for this thought.&lt;ref&gt;Derrida, J: "How to Avoid Speaking: Denials" pages 3–70, in "Languages of the Unsayable: The Play of Negativity in Literature and Literary Theory" Stanley Budick and Wolfgang Iser, eds. 1989&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern spirituality===
{{see also|Nondualism}}

Meister Eckhart has become one of the timeless heroes of modern [[spirituality]], which thrives on an all-inclusive [[syncretism]].{{sfn|Hanegraaf|1996}} This syncretism started with the colonisation of Asia, and the search of similarities between eastern and western religions.{{sfn|King|2002}} Western monotheism was projected onto eastern religiosity by western orientalists, trying to accommodate eastern religiosity to a western understanding, whereafter Asian intellectuals used these projections as a starting point to propose the superiority of those eastern religions.{{sfn|King|2002}} Early on, the figure of Meister Eckhart has played a role in these developments and [[Pizza effect|exchanges]].{{sfn|King|2002}}

Renewed academic attention to Eckhart has attracted favorable attention to his work from contemporary non-Christian mystics.  Eckhart's most famous single quote, "The Eye with which I see God is the same Eye with which God sees me", is commonly cited by thinkers within [[neopaganism]] and ultimatist [[Buddhism]] as a point of contact between these traditions and Christian mysticism.

====Schopenhauer====
The first translation of Upanishads appeared in two parts in 1801 and 1802.{{sfn|King|2002}} The 19th-century philosopher [[Schopenhauer]] was influenced by the early translations of the Upanishads, which he called "the consolation of my life".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=178}}{{efn|And he called his poodle "Atman".{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=178}}}} Schopenhauer compared Eckhart's views to the teachings of Indian, Christian and Islamic [[mysticism|mystic]]s and [[ascetic]]s:
{{quote|If we turn from the forms, produced by external circumstances, and go to the root of things, we shall find that [[Sakyamuni]] and Meister Eckhart teach the same thing; only that the former dared to express his ideas plainly and positively, whereas Eckhart is obliged to clothe them in the garment of the Christian myth, and to adapt his expressions thereto.&lt;ref&gt;[[Schopenhauer]], ''[[The World as Will and Representation]]'', Vol. II, Ch. XLVIII&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Schopenhauer also stated:
{{quote|Buddha, Eckhart, and I all teach essentially the same.{{sfn|King|2002|p=125}}}}

====Theosophical Society====
A major force in the mutual influence of eastern and western ideas and religiosity was the [[Theosophical Society]],{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=185-188}}{{sfn|Sinari|2000}} which also incorporated Eckhart in its notion of [[Theosophy (Blavatskian)|Theosophy]].{{sfn|Partridge|2006|p=3, note 2}} It searched for ancient wisdom in the east, spreading eastern religious ideas in the west.{{sfn|Lavoie|2012}} One of its salient features was the belief in [[Masters of the Ancient Wisdom (Theosophy)|"Masters of Wisdom"]],{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}}{{efn|See also [[Ascended Master Teachings]]}} "beings, human or once human, who have transcended the normal frontiers of knowledge, and who make their wisdom available to others".{{sfn|Gilchrist|1996|p=32}} The Theosophical Society also spread western ideas in the east, aiding a modernisation of eastern traditions, and contributing to a growing nationalism in the Asian colonies.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}}

====Neo-Vedanta====
{{Main|Neo-Vedanta}}

The Theosophical Society had a major influence on [[Hindu reform movements]].{{sfn|Sinari|2000}}{{efn|The [[Theosophical Society]] and the [[Arya Samaj]] were united from 1878 to 1882, as the [[Theosophical Society of the Arya Samaj]].{{sfn|Johnson|1994|p=107}}}} A major proponent of this "neo-Hinduism", also called "neo-Vedanta",{{sfn|King|2002|p=93}} was [[Vivekananda]]{{sfn|Renard|2010|p=189-193}}{{sfn|Michaelson|2009|p=79-81}} (1863–1902) who popularised his modernised interpretation{{sfn|Rambachan|1994}} of Advaita Vedanta in the 19th and early 20th century in both India and the west,{{sfn|Michaelson|2009|p=79-81}} emphasising ''anubhava'' ("personal experience"{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=1}}) over scriptural authority.{{sfn|Rambachan|1994|p=1}} Vivekananda's teachings have been compared to Eckhart's teachings.{{sfn|Ganapathy|2003|p=247}}{{sfn|Akhilananda Swami|2012}}

In the 20th century, Eckhart's thoughts were also compared to [[Adi Shankara|Shankara]]'s [[Advaita Vedanta]] by [[Rudolf Otto]] in his ''Mysticism East and West''.{{sfn|King|2002|p=125-128}} According to King, the aim of this work was to redeem Eckhart's mysticism in Protestant circles,{{sfn|King|2002|p=126}} attempting "to establish the superiority of the German mysticism of Eckhart over the Indian mysticism of Sankara".{{sfn|King|2002|p=125}}

====Buddhist modernism====
{{Main|Buddhist modernism}}

The Theosophical Society also had a major influence on [[Buddhist modernism]],{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} and the spread of this modernised Buddhism in the west.{{sfn|McMahan|2008}} Along with [[Henry Steel Olcott|H. S. Olcott]] and [[Anagarika Dharmapala]], [[Helena P. Blavatsky]] was instrumental in the Western transmission and revival of [[Theravada Buddhism]].{{sfn|McMahan|2008|p=98}}{{sfn|Gombrich|1996|p=185-188}}{{sfn|Fields|1992|p=83-118}}

In 1891, [[Karl Eugen Neumann]], who translated large parts of the [[Tripitaka]], found parallels between Eckhart and [[Buddhism]],{{sfn|Moran|2012|p=672}} which he published in ''Zwei buddhistische Suttas und ein Traktat Meister Eckharts'' ("Two Buddhist Suttas and a treatise of Meister Eckhart"). [[D.T. Suzuki]], who joined the [[Theosophical Society Adyar]] and was an active Theosophist,{{sfn|Algeo|2005}}{{sfn|Algeo|2007}}{{sfn|Tweed|2005}} discerned parallels between Eckhart's teachings and [[Zen]] Buddhism in his ''Mysticism:Christian and Buddhist'',{{sfn|Schurmann|2001|p=217}} drawing similarities between Eckhart's "pure nothingness" (''ein bloss nicht'') and [[sunyata]].{{sfn|King|2002|p=156}} [[Shizuteru Ueda]], a third generation [[Kyoto School]] philosopher and scholar in medieval philosophy showed similarities between Eckhart's [[soteriology]] and [[Zen Buddhism]] in an article.&lt;ref&gt;Shizuteru Ueda (1989), ''Eckhart um zen am problem''&lt;/ref&gt;

Reiner Schurmann, a Professor of Philosophy, while agreeing with Daisetz T. Suzuki that there exist certain similarities between [[Zen]] Buddhism and Meister Eckhart's teaching, also disputed Suzuki's contention that the ideas expounded in Eckhart's sermons closely approach Buddhist thought, "so closely indeed, that one could stamp them almost definitely as coming out of Buddhist speculations".{{sfn|Schurmann|2001|p=217}} Schurmann's several clarifications included:
# On the question of "Time" and Eckhart's view (claimed as parallel to Buddhism in reducing awakening to instantaneity) that the birth of the Word in the ground of the mind must accomplish itself in an instant, in "the eternal now", that in fact Eckhart in this respect is rooted directly in the catechisis of the Fathers of the Church rather than merely derived from Buddhism;{{sfn|Schurmann|2001|p=217}}
# On the question of "Isness" and Suzuki's contention that the "Christian experiences are not after all different from those of the Buddhist; terminology is all that divides us", that in Eckhart "the Godhead's ''istigkeit'' [translated as "isness" by Suzuki] is a negation of all quiddities; it says that God, rather than non-being, is at the heart of all things" thereby demonstrating with Eckhart's theocentrism that "the istigkeit of the Godhead and the isness of a thing then refer to two opposite experiences in Meister Eckhart and Suzuki:  in the former, to God, and in the latter, to `our ordinary state of the mind'" and Buddhism's attempts to think "pure nothingness";{{sfn|Schurmann|2001|p=218}}
# On the question of "Emptiness" and Eckhart's view (claimed as parallel to Buddhist emphasis "on the emptiness of all 'composite things'") that only a perfectly released person, devoid of all, comprehends, "seizes", God, that the Buddhist "emptiness" seems to concern man's relation to things while Eckhart's concern is with what is "at the end of the road opened by detachment [which is] the mind espouses the very movement of the divine ''dehiscence''; it does what the Godhead does: it lets all things be; not only must God also abandon all of his own—names and attributes if he is to reach into the ground of the mind (this is already a step beyond the recognition of the emptiness of all composite things), but God's essential being – releasement – becomes the being of a released man."{{sfn|Schurmann|2001|p=219}}

===Psychology and Psychoanalysis===
====Erich Fromm====
The notable humanistic psychoanalyst and philosopher [[Erich Fromm]] was another scholar who brought renewed attention in the west to Eckhart's writings, drawing upon many of the latter's themes in his large corpus of work. Eckhart was a significant influence in developing [[United Nations]] Secretary General [[Dag Hammarskjöld]]'s conception of spiritual growth through selfless service to humanity, as detailed in his book of contemplations called [[Vägmärken]] ('Markings').{{efn|Dusen: "[t]he counterpoint to this enormously exposed and public life is Eckhart and Jan van Ruysbroek. They really give me balance and-a more necessary sense of humor." Henry P van Dusen. Dag Hammarskjöld. A Biographical Interpretation of Markings. Faber and Faber. London 1967 pp.49–50.}}

====Carl G. Jung====
In ''Aion, Researches Into the Phenomenology of Self'' &lt;ref&gt;The Collected Works of C. G. Jung, Volume 9, Part II, Princeton University Press (1959)&lt;/ref&gt; [[Carl G. Jung]] cites Eckhart approvingly in his discussion of Christ as a symbol of the [[archetypal]] self. Jung sees Eckhart as a Christian Gnostic:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Meister Eckhart's theology knows a "Godhead" of which no qualities, except unity and being, can be predicated; it "is becoming," it is not yet Lord of itself, and it represents an absolute coincidence of opposites: "But its simple nature is of forms formless; of becoming becomingless; of beings beingless; of things thingless," etc. Union of opposites is equivalent to unconsciousness, so far as human logic goes, for consciousness presupposes a differentiation into subject and object and a relation between them. (Page 193.) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;As the Godhead is essentially unconscious, so too is the man who lives in God.  In his sermon on "The Poor in Spirit" (Matt. 5 : 3), the Meister says: "The man who has this poverty has everything he was when he lived not in any wise, neither in himself, nor in truth, nor in God. He is so quit and empty of all knowing that no knowledge of God is alive in him; for while he stood in the eternal nature of god, there lived in him not another: what lived there was himself.  And so we say this man is as empty of his own knowledge as he was when he was not anything; he lets God work with what he will, and he stands empty as when he came from God."  Therefore he should love God in the following way: "Love him as he is; a not-God, a not-spirit, a not-person, a not-image; as a sheer, pure, clear One, which he is, sundered from all secondness; and in this One let us sink eternally, from nothing to nothing. So help us God. Amen."  (Page 193.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Jung summed up his view of Eckhart saying:

&lt;blockquote&gt;The world embracing spirit of Meister Eckhart knew, without discursive knowledge, the primordial mystical experience of India as well as of the Gnostics, and was itself the finest flower on the tree of the "Free Spirit" that flourished at the beginning of the eleventh century. Well might the writings of this Master be buried for six hundred years, for "his time was not yet come." Only in the nineteenth century did he find a public at all capable of appreciating the grandeur of his mind. (Page 194.)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===In popular culture===
In ''[[Jacob's Ladder (1990 film)|Jacob's Ladder]]'', Louis, the main character's friend, attributes the following quote to Eckhart:
{{quote|You know what he [Eckhart] said? The only thing that burns in Hell is the part of you that won't let go of your life; your memories, your attachments. They burn 'em all away. But they're not punishing you, he said. They're freeing your soul. [...] If you're frightened of dying and holding on, you'll see devils tearing your life away. But if you've made your peace then the devils are really angels, freeing you from the Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Rubin 1990, p.82&lt;/ref&gt;{{citation needed|date=January 2011}}}}

In ''[[Z213: Exit]]'', by [[Dimitris Lyacos]] the same quote attributed to Eckhart, appears in a slightly different wording:
{{quote|[...]your own are burning and your memories and you don't want to leave them. Everything will burn to the end, you suffer, but nobody is punishing you, they are just setting your soul free. Don't be afraid because while you fear death they will rend your soul like demons. Only calm down and you will see the angels who are setting you free and then you will be free.&lt;ref&gt;Lyacos 2010, p.88&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the book ''[[The Gargoyle (novel)|The Gargoyle]]'' by [[Andrew Davidson (author)|Andrew Davidson]], Eckhart is mentioned in a story Marianne Engel recounts to the (unnamed) protagonist about her days in the Engelthal Monastery:
{{quote|[...] Meister Eckhart would not even admit that God was good [...] Eckhart's position was that anything that was good can become better, and whatever may become better may become best. God cannot be referred to as "good", "better", or best because He is above all things. If a man says that God is wise, the man is lying because anything that is wise can become wiser. Anything that a man might say about God is incorrect, even calling Him by the name of God. God is "superessential nothingness" and "transcendent Being" [...] beyond all words and beyond all understanding. The best a man can do is remain silent, because anytime he prates on about God, he is committing the sin of lying. The true master knows that if he had a God he could understand, He would never hold Him to be God.&lt;ref&gt;Andrew Davidson, ''The Gargoyle'', pp.140–41&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Eckhart is also referenced in [[J. D. Salinger]]'s ''[[Franny and Zooey]]''. In a letter to Zooey, Buddy says,
{{quote|I can't help thinking you'd make a damn site better-adjusted actor if Seymour and I hadn't thrown in the [[Upanishads]] and the [[Diamond Sutra]] and Eckhart and all our other old loves with the rest of your recommended reading when you were small.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Salinger|first=J.D|title=Franny and Zooey|year=1955|publisher=Little Brown and Company|location=Boston|isbn=0-316-76949-5|pages=59–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The third movement of [[John Adams (composer)|John Adams's]] [[Harmonielehre]] symphony (1985) is titled 'Meister Eckhart and Quackie', which imagines the mystic floating through space with the composer's daughter Emily (nicknamed Quackie) on his back whispering secrets of grace in his ear.&lt;ref&gt;Simon Rattle &amp; City of Birmingham SO (1994) CD booklet&lt;/ref&gt;

==Works==
[[File:MS Soest 33, fol. 57v, a–b.jpg|thumb|Manuscript Soest, Stadtarchiv und Wissenschaftliche Stadtbibliothek, Codex Nr. 33, folium 57 verso, a–b]]
The publication of the modern critical edition of Eckhart's German and Latin works began in 1936, and is nearly complete.&lt;ref&gt;''Meister Eckhart: Die deutschen und lateinischen Werke. Herausgegeben im Auftrage der Deutschen Forschungsgemeinschaft''. Stuttgart and Berlin: Verlag W. Kohlhammer, 11 Vols., 1936–. The Latin works comprise 6 volumes (widely referred to as LW1–6), while the German works comprise 5 volumes (widely referred to as DW1–5).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Latin works===
One difficulty with Eckhart's Latin writings is that they clearly represent only a small portion of what he planned to write. Eckhart describes his plans to write a vast ''Opus Tripartitum'' (''Three-Part Work''). Unfortunately, all that exists today of the first part, the ''Work of Propositions'', is the Prologue illustrating the first proposition (with Eckhart intending the first part alone to consist of over one thousand propositions).&lt;ref&gt;''Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense'', trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.64. This Prologue exists in two manuscripts discovered by [[Henry Denifle|Denifle]]&amp;nbsp;– one discovered in Erfurt in 1880, and the other in [[Bernkastel-Kues|Kues]] in 1886.&lt;/ref&gt; The second part, called the ''Work of Questions'', no longer exists. The third part, the ''Work of Commentaries'', is the major surviving Latin work by Eckhart, consisting of a Prologue, six commentaries, and fifty-six sermons.&lt;ref&gt;''Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense'', trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.65.&lt;/ref&gt; It used to be thought that this work was begun while Eckhart was in Paris between 1311 and 1313; however, recent manuscript discoveries mean that much of what survives must be dated to before 1310.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard McGinn, ''The Harvest of Mysticism'', (2005), p.98.&lt;/ref&gt;

The surviving Latin works are, therefore:
*The early ''Quaestiones Parisiensis'' (''Parisian Questions'').&lt;ref&gt;LW 1:27–83. The English translation is Armand Maurer, ed., ''Master Eckhart: Parisian Questions and Prologues'', Toronto, Canada: Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, 1974.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Prologus generalis in Opus tripartitium'' (''General Prologue to the Three-Part Work'').&lt;ref&gt;LW 1:148–165. An English translation is in Armand Maurer, ed., ''Master Eckhart: Parisian Questions and Prologues'', Toronto, Canada: Pontifical Institute of Medieval Studies, 1974, pp.77–104.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Prologus in Opus propositionum'' (''Prologue to the Work of Propositions'').&lt;ref&gt;LW 1:166–182.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Prologus in Opus expositionum'' (''Prologue to the Work of Commentaries'').&lt;ref&gt;LW 1:183–184.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Expositio Libri Genesis'' (''Commentary on the Book of Genesis'').&lt;ref&gt;LW 1:185–444. The Prologue and the commentary on Genesis 3 are translated into English in ''Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense'', trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, pp.82–121.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Liber Parabolorum Genesis'' (''Book of the Parables of Genesis'').&lt;ref&gt;LW 1:447–702.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Expositio Libri Exodi'' (''Commentary on the Book of Exodus'').&lt;ref&gt;LW 2:1–227. This is translated into English in its entirety in ''Meister Eckhart: Teacher and Preacher'', trans. and ed. by [[Bernard McGinn (theologian)|Bernard McGinn]] and Frank Tobin, New York and London: Paulist Press/SPCK, 1987, pp.41–146.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Expositio Libri Sapientiae'' (''Commentary on the Book of Wisdom'').&lt;ref&gt;LW 2:301–643.&lt;/ref&gt;
*''Sermones et Lectiones super Ecclesiastici c.24:23–31'' (''Sermons and Lectures on the Twenty-fourth chapter of Ecclesiasticus'').&lt;ref&gt;LW 2:29–300. The commentary on Ecclesiasticus 24.29 is translated into English in ''Meister Eckhart: Teacher and Preacher'', trans. and ed. by [[Bernard McGinn (theologian)|Bernard McGinn]] and Frank Tobin, New York and London: Paulist Press/SPCK, 1987, pp.174–181.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Fragments of the ''Commentary on the Song of Songs'' survive
*''Expositio sancti Evangelii secundum Iohannem'' (''Commentary on John'')&lt;ref&gt;LW 3. The commentary on John 1:1–14 is translated into English in ''Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense'', trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, pp.122–173. The commentary on John 14.8 is translated into English in ''Meister Eckhart: Teacher and Preacher'', trans. and ed. by [[Bernard McGinn (theologian)|Bernard McGinn]] and Frank Tobin, New York and London: Paulist Press/SPCK, 1987, pp.182–205.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Various sermons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Markus |first=Professor |url=http://markusvinzent.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/meister-eckhart-in-english-i-books-with.html |title=LW4. An extensive list of English translations of the sermons |publisher=Markusvinzent.blogspot.co.uk |date=2011-04-22 |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; including some preserved in the collection ''Paradisus anime intelligentis'' (''Paradise of the Intelligent Soul''/''Paradise of the Intellectual Soul'').&lt;ref&gt;Around half of the 64 sermons in the ''Paradisus'' were by Eckhart, with the majority contributed by Dominicans. On the origin and purpose of the ''Paradisus'' (with dates around 1330–40 generally suggested), see Bernard McGinn, ''The Harvest of Mysticism'', (2005), p.321–2 (which reverses some of the arguments of McGinn (2001).&lt;/ref&gt;
*A brief treatise on the Lord's Prayer, largely an anthology culled from earlier authorities
*The ''Defense''.&lt;ref&gt;Selections are translated into English in ''Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense'', trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, pp.71–76.&lt;/ref&gt;
*Although not composed by Eckhart, also relevant are the Vatican archive materials relating to Eckhart's trial, the ''Votum theologicum'' (or ''Opinion'') of the Avignon commission who investigated Eckhart, and the bull ''In agro dominico''.

===Vernacular works===
Questions concerning the authenticity of the Middle High German texts attributed to Eckhart are much greater than for the Latin texts. The problems involve not only whether a particular sermon or treatise is to be judged authentic or pseudonymous, but also, given the large number of manuscripts and the fragmentary condition of many of them, whether it is even possible to establish the text for some of the pieces accepted as genuine.&lt;ref&gt;''Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense'', trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981, p.&amp;nbsp;66.&lt;/ref&gt; Eckhart's sermons are versions written down by others from memory or from notes, meaning that the possibility for error was much greater than for the carefully written Latin treatises.

The critical edition of Eckhart's works traditionally accepted 86 sermons as genuine, based on the research done by its editor Josef Quint (1898-1976)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eckhart.de/index.htm?forscher.htm#Quint |title=Josef Quint |publisher=Eckhart.de |date=2017-07-24 |accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; during the 20th century. Of these, ''Sermons'' 1–16b are proved authentic by direct citation in the ''Defense''. ''Sermons'' 17–24 have such close textual affinities with Latin sermons recognised as genuine that they are accepted. ''Sermons'' 25–86 are harder to verify, and judgements have been made on the basis of style and content.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Markus |first=Professor |url=http://markusvinzent.blogspot.co.uk/2011/04/meister-eckhart-in-english-i-books-with.html |title=An extensive list of English translations of the sermons |publisher=Markusvinzent.blogspot.co.uk |date=2011-04-22 |accessdate=2014-02-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Georg Steer took over the editorship in 1983.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eckhart.de/index.htm?forscher.htm |title=Georg Steer |publisher=Eckhart.de |date=2017-07-24 |accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 2003 and 2016, the critical edition under Georg Steer added another 30 vernacular sermons (Nos. 87 to 117) in volumes 4.1 and 4.2.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eckhart.de/index.htm?wgabe.htm |title=Die deutschen Werke |publisher=Eckhart.de |date=2017-07-24 |accessdate=2017-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because six sermons exist in an A and B version (5a-b, 13-13a, 16a-b, 20a-b, 36a-b und 54a-b)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eckhart.de/?aktuell.htm#Pr171 |title=Predigten |publisher=Eckhart.de |date=2017-08-22 |accessdate=2018-02-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; the final total of vernacular sermons is 123 (numbered consecutively from 1 to 117).

When Franz Pfeiffer published his edition of Eckhart's works in 1857, he included seventeen vernacular treatises he considered to be written by Eckhart. Modern scholarship is much more cautious, however, and the critical edition accepts only four of Eckhart's vernacular treatises as genuine:
*The longest of these, the ''Reden der Unterweisung'' (''Counsels on Discernment''/''Discourses on Instruction''/''Talks of Instruction''),&lt;ref&gt;LW 5:137–376.&lt;/ref&gt; is probably Eckhart's earliest surviving work, a set of spiritual instructions that he gave to young Dominicans in the 1290s. It was clearly a popular work, with fifty-one manuscripts known.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard McGinn, ''The Harvest of Mysticism'', (2005), p.95.&lt;/ref&gt;
*A second vernacular treatise, the ''Liber Benedictus'' (''Book 'Benedictus' ''), in fact consists of two related treatises&amp;nbsp;– firstly, ''Daz buoch der götlîchen trœstunge''(''The Book of the Divine Consolation''),&lt;ref&gt;DW 5:1–105.&lt;/ref&gt; and secondly, a sermon entitled ''Von dem edeln menschen'' (''Of the Nobleman'').&lt;ref&gt;DW 5:109–119.&lt;/ref&gt;
*The final vernacular treatise accepted as genuine by the critical edition is entitled ''Von Abgescheidenheit'' (''On Detachment'').&lt;ref&gt;DW 5:400–434. All four vernacular treatises are translated into English in ''Meister Eckhart, The Essential Sermons, Commentaries, Treatises and Defense'', trans. and ed. by Bernard McGinn and Edmund Colledge, New York: Paulist Press, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this treatise is generally today not thought to be written by Eckhart.&lt;ref&gt;Bernard McGinn, ''The Harvest of Mysticism'', (2005), p.632.&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''''Mozi''''' ({{zh|c=墨子}}) is an ancient Chinese text from the [[Warring States period]] (476{{ndash}}221{{sbc}}) that expounds the philosophy of [[Mohism]].  It propounds such Mohist ideas as impartiality, meritocratic governance, economic growth, and aversion to ostentation, and is known for its plain and simple language.

The chapters of the ''Mozi'' can be divided into several categories: a core group of 31 chapters, which contain the basic philosophic ideas of the Mohist school; several chapters on logic, which are among the most important early Chinese texts on logic and are traditionally known as the "Dialectical Chapters"; five sections containing stories and information about Mozi and his followers; and eleven chapters on technology and defensive warfare, on which the Mohists were expert and which are valuable sources of information on ancient Chinese military technology.{{sfnp|Knechtges|2010|p=677}}  There are also two other minor sections: an initial group of seven chapters that are clearly of a much later date, and two anti-Confucian chapters, only one of which has survived.

The Mohist philosophical school died out in the 3rd century BC, and copies of the ''Mozi'' were not well preserved.  The modern text has been described as "notoriously corrupt" {{ndash}} of its 71 original chapters, 18 have been lost and several others are badly fragmented.{{sfnp|Graham|1993|p=339}}{{sfnp|Nivison|1999|p=762}}

==Authorship==
{{main|Mozi}}
The ''Mozi'', as well as the entire philosophical school of [[Mohism]], is named for and traditionally ascribed to [[Mo Di]], or "Master Mo" ([[Chinese language|Chinese]]: ''Mòzǐ'' 墨子), a figure of the 5th century BC about whom nothing is reliably known.{{sfnp|Nivison|1999|p=760}}  Most sources describe him as being from the [[Lu (state)|State of Lu]]—though one says that he was from the [[Song (state)|State of Song]]—and say that he traveled around the various [[Warring States period|Warring States]] trying to persuade their rulers to stop attacking each other.{{sfnp|Knechtges|2010|p=677}}  Mozi seems to have come from a humble family,{{sfnp|Knechtges|2010|p=677}} and some elements of the book suggest that he may have been some type of artisan or craftsman, such as a [[carpenter]].{{sfnp|Nivison|1999|p=760}}  Some scholars have theorized that the name Mo (墨), which means "ink", may not truly be a surname, but could be indicative of him having undergone the branding or tattooing that was used in ancient China as a form of corporal punishment for criminals.{{sfnp|Nivison|1999|p=760}}{{sfnp|Watson|1999|p=64}}

==Content==
The ''Mozi'' originally comprised 71 chapters, but 18 of these have been lost and a number of others are damaged and fragmented.  The text can be divided into a total of six sections:{{sfnp|Knechtges|2010|p=677}}{{sfnp|Graham|1993|pp=336–37}}{{sfnp|Nivison|1999|pp=761–63}}

*'''Chapters 1–7''': a group of miscellaneous essays and dialogues that were clearly added at a later date and are somewhat incongruous with the rest of the book.
*'''Chapters 8–37''': a large group of chapters{{mdash}}of which seven are missing and three are fragmentary{{mdash}}that form the core ''Mozi'' chapters, and elucidate the ten main philosophical doctrines of the Mohist school of thought.  Mozi is frequently referenced and cited in these chapters.
*'''Chapters 38–39''': two chapters{{mdash}}of which only chapter 39 survives{{mdash}}entitled "Against Confucianism" (''Fēi Rú'' 非儒), containing polemical arguments against the ideals of [[Confucianism]].  These chapters are sometimes grouped with chapters 8–37.
*'''Chapters 40–45''': a group of five chapters, often called the "Dialectical Chapters", which are some of the most unique writings of ancient China, treating topics in [[logic]], [[epistemology]], [[ethics]], [[geometry]], [[optics]], and mechanics.  These chapters are dense and difficult, largely because the text is badly garbled and corrupted.
*'''Chapters 46–51''': six chapters{{mdash}}of which chapter 51, including even its title, has been lost{{mdash}}that contain stories and dialogues about Mozi and his followers.  These chapters are probably of somewhat later date, and are probably partly fictional.
*'''Chapters 52–71''': a group of chapters{{mdash}}nine of which have been lost{{mdash}}known as the "Military Chapters", containing instructions on defensive warfare, supposedly from Mozi to his chief disciple Qin Guli.  These chapters, like the "Dialectical Chapters", are badly damaged and corrupted.

==Selected translations==
The damaged nature of the later chapters of the ''Mozi'' have made its translations highly difficult, and often requires translators to repair and re-edit the text before translating. The first ''Mozi'' translation in a Western language{{mdash}}the 1922 German translation of Alfred Forke{{mdash}}was done before these problems were well understood, and thus contains a large number of errors in the "Dialectical" and "Military" chapters.{{sfnp|Graham|1993|p=340}} Only in the late 20th century did accurate translations of the later ''Mozi'' chapters appear.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="22750">{{For|the philosophy of perception|naïve realism}}

In [[social psychology]], '''naïve realism'''&amp;nbsp;is the human tendency to believe that we see the world around us [[Objectivity (philosophy)|objectively]], and that people who disagree with us must be uninformed, [[Irrationality|irrational]], or [[bias]]ed. 

Naïve realism provides a theoretical basis for several other [[cognitive bias]]es, which are systematic errors when it comes to thinking and making decisions. These include the [[False-consensus effect|false consensus effect]], [[Actor–observer asymmetry|actor-observer bias]], [[bias blind spot]], and [[fundamental attribution error]], among others.

The term, as it is used in [[psychology]] today, was coined by [[social psychologist]] [[Lee Ross]] and his colleagues in the 1990s.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Griffin, D., &amp; Ross, L. (1991). Subjective construal, social inference, and human misunderstanding. In M. P. Zanna (Ed.), ''Advances in Experimental Social Psychology'' (pp.&amp;nbsp;319–359). San Diego, CA: Academic Press. {{DOI|10.1016/S0065-2601(08)60333-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is related to the&amp;nbsp;[[Philosophy|philosophical]] concept of&amp;nbsp;[[naïve realism]], which is the idea that our senses allow us to perceive objects directly and without any intervening processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to Philosophy|last = Nuttall|first = John|publisher = Wiley|year = 2002|isbn = 978-0-7456-1663-6|location = Maiden, MA|pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt; Social psychologists in the mid-20th century argued against this stance and proposed instead that [[perception]] is inherently subjective.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title = An Introduction to the History of Psychology|last = Hergenhahn|first = B.|publisher = Cengage Learning|year = 2008|isbn = 0-495-50621-4|location = |pages = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Several prominent social psychologists have studied naïve realism experimentally, including&amp;nbsp;[[Lee Ross]], Andrew Ward, Dale Griffin, Emily Pronin,&amp;nbsp;[[Thomas Gilovich]], Robert Robinson, and [[Dacher Keltner]]. In 2010, the ''Handbook of Social Psychology'' recognized naïve realism as one of "four hard-won insights about [[Perception|human perception]], [[Thought|thinking]], [[motivation]] and [[behavior]] that&amp;nbsp;... represent important, indeed foundational, contributions of [[social psychology]]."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;Ross, L.; Lepper, M.; Ward, A., [http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1002/9780470561119.socpsy001001/full History of Social Psychology: Insights, Challenges, and Contributions to Theory and Application]. In Fiske, S. T., In Gilbert, D. T., In Lindzey, G., &amp; Jongsma, A. E. (2010).&amp;nbsp;''Handbook of Social Psychology''. ''Vol.1.'' Hoboken, N.J: Wiley. {{DOI|10.1002/9780470561119.socpsy001001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Main assumptions ==
[[Lee Ross]] and fellow psychologist Andrew Ward have outlined three interrelated assumptions, or "tenets," that make up naïve realism. They argue that these assumptions are supported by a long line of thinking in social psychology, along with several empirical studies. According to their model, people:
* Believe that they see the world objectively and without bias.
* Expect that others will come to the same conclusions, so long as they are exposed to the same information and interpret it in a rational manner.
* Assume that others who do not share the same views must be ignorant, irrational, or biased.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Ross, L., &amp; Ward, A. (1996).

== History of concept ==
Naïve realism follows from a [[Subjectivism|subjectivist]] tradition in modern [[social psychology]], which traces its roots back to one of the field's founders, a German-American psychologist named [[Kurt Lewin]][[social psychology|.]]&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.68.3.404|title=Actual versus assumed differences in construal: "Naive realism" in intergroup perception and conflict|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=68|issue=3|pages=404–417|year=1995|last1=Robinson|first1=Robert J.|last2=Keltner|first2=Dacher|last3=Ward|first3=Andrew|last4=Ross|first4=Lee}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewin's ideas were strongly informed by [[Gestalt psychology]], a 20th-century school of thought which focused on examining psychological phenomena in context, as parts of a whole.&lt;ref&gt;Gestalt psychology.&amp;nbsp;(2015).

From the 1920s through the 1940s, Lewin developed an approach for studying human behavior which he called [[Field theory (psychology)|field theory]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1G2-3045000409.html "Field Theory."]&amp;nbsp;International Encyclopedia of the Social Sciences. 1968. Retrieved November 17, 2015 from Encyclopedia.com&lt;/ref&gt; Field theory proposes that a person's behavior is a [[Lewin's equation|function of the person and the environment]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1086/218177|title=Field Theory and Experiment in Social Psychology: Concepts and Methods|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=44|issue=6|pages=868–896|year=1939|last1=Lewin|first1=Kurt}}&lt;/ref&gt; Lewin considered a person's psychological environment, or "life space," to be [[subjectivity|subjective]] and thus distinct from physical reality.&lt;ref name=":6"/&gt;

During this time period, subjectivist ideas also propagated throughout other areas of [[psychology]]. For example, [[Jean Piaget]], a [[Developmental psychology|developmental psychologist]], argued that children view the world through an [[Egocentric bias|egocentric]] lens, and they have trouble separating their own beliefs from the beliefs of others.&lt;ref&gt;Piaget, J. (1926) ''The Language and Thought of the Child''. New York: Harcourt, Brace.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s and 1950s, early pioneers in [[social psychology]] applied the [[Subjectivism|subjectivist]] view to the field of [[social perception]]. In 1948, psychologists David Kretch and Richard Krutchfield argued that people perceive and interpret the world according to their "own needs, own connotations, own personality, own previously formed cognitive patterns."&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;Molouki, S., &amp; Pronin, E. (2015). Self and other. In E. Borgida &amp; J. A. Bargh (Eds.),&amp;nbsp;''APA Handbook of Personality and Social Psychology'',&amp;nbsp;Volume 1:&amp;nbsp;''Attitudes and Social Cognition.''&amp;nbsp;Washington, DC: APA. {{DOI|10.1037/14341-013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Theory and Problems of Social Psychology|last = Kretch|first = D.|publisher = McGraw Hill|year = 1948|isbn = |location = New York|pages = 94|last2 = Crutchfield|first2 = R.S.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Social psychologist [[:de:Gustav Ichheiser|Gustav Ichheiser]] expanded on this idea, noting how biases in [[person perception]] lead to misunderstandings in [[social relation]]s. According to Ichheiser, "We tend to resolve our perplexity arising out of the experience that other people see the world differently than we see it ourselves by declaring that these others, in consequence of some basic intellectual and moral defect, are unable to see things 'as they really are' and to react to them 'in a normal way.' We thus imply, of course, that things are in fact as we see them, and that our ways are the normal ways."&lt;ref&gt;Ichheiser, G. (1949) [https://www.jstor.org/stable/i328847 Misunderstandings in Human Relations: A study in false social perception]. &lt;abbr&gt;''American Journal of Sociology, Supplement to the September issue''&lt;/abbr&gt;'','' pp.1–72.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Solomon Asch]], a prominent [[Social psychology|social psychologist]] who was also brought up in the [[Gestalt psychology|Gestalt]] tradition, argued that people disagree because they base their judgments on different [[construals]], or ways of looking at various issues.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/00224545.1940.9921487|title=Studies in the Principles of Judgments and Attitudes: II. Determination of Judgments by Group and by Ego Standards|journal=The Journal of Social Psychology|volume=12|issue=2|pages=433–465|year=1940|last1=Asch|first1=S. E.}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, they are under the illusion that their judgments about the social world are objective. "This attitude, which has been aptly described as naive realism, sees no problem in the fact of perception or knowledge of the surroundings. Things are what they appear to be; they have just the qualities that they reveal to sight and touch," he wrote in his textbook ''Social Psychology'' in 1952. "This attitude, does not, however, describe the actual conditions of our knowledge of the surroundings."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = Social Psychology|last = Asch|first = Solomon|publisher = Prentice-Hall, Inc.|year = 1952|isbn = |location = Englewood Cliffs, N.J.|pages = 46–47}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Experimental evidence ==

=== "They saw a game" ===
In a seminal study in [[social psychology]], which was published in a paper in 1954, students from [[Dartmouth College|Dartmouth]] and [[Princeton University|Princeton]] watched a video of a heated football game between the two schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = They saw a game; a case study|journal = The Journal of Abnormal and Social Psychology|pages = 129–134|volume = 49|issue = 1|doi = 10.1037/h0057880|first = Albert H.|last = Hastorf|first2 = Hadley|last2 = Cantril|year = 1954}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though they looked at the same footage, fans from both schools perceived the game very differently. The Princeton students "saw" the Dartmouth team make twice as many infractions as their own team, and they also saw the team make twice as many infractions compared to what the Dartmouth students saw. Dartmouth students viewed the game as being evenly-matched in violence, in which both sides were to blame. This study revealed that two groups perceived an event [[Subjectivity|subjectively]]. Each team believed they saw the event objectively and that the other side's [[perception]] of the event was blinded by [[bias]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== False consensus effect ===
A 1977 study conducted by [[Lee Ross|Ross]] and colleagues provided early evidence for a [[cognitive bias]] called the [[False-consensus effect|false consensus effect]], which is the tendency for people to overestimate the extent to which others share the same views.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The "false consensus effect": An egocentric bias in social perception and attribution processes|url = http://linkinghub.elsevier.com/retrieve/pii/002210317790049X|journal = Journal of Experimental Social Psychology|pages = 279–301|volume = 13|issue = 3|doi = 10.1016/0022-1031(77)90049-x|first = Lee|last = Ross|first2 = David|last2 = Greene|first3 = Pamela|last3 = House|year = 1977}}&lt;/ref&gt; This bias has been cited as supporting the first two tenets of naïve realism.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; In the study, students were asked whether they would wear a sandwich-board sign, which said "Eat At Joe's" on it, around campus. Then they were asked to indicate whether they thought other students were likely to wear the sign, and what they thought about students who were either willing to wear it or not. The researchers found that students who agreed to wear the sign thought that the majority of students would wear the sign, and they thought that refusing to wear the sign was more revealing of their peers' personal attributes. Conversely, students who declined to wear the sign thought that most other students would also refuse, and that accepting the invitation was more revealing of certain personality traits.

=== Hostile media effect ===
A phenomenon referred to as the [[hostile media effect]] demonstrates that partisans can view neutral events [[Subjectivity|subjectively]] according to their own needs and values, and make the assumption that those who interpret the event differently are biased. For a study in 1985, pro-Israeli and pro-Arab students were asked to watch real news coverage on the 1982 [[Sabra and Shatila massacre]], a massive killing of Palestinian refugees (Vallone, Lee Ross and Lepper, 1985).&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The hostile media phenomenon: Biased perception and perceptions of media bias in coverage of the Beirut massacre|journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|pages = 577–585|volume = 49|issue = 3|doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.49.3.577|pmid = 4045697|first = Robert P.|last = Vallone|first2 = Lee|last2 = Ross|first3 = Mark R.|last3 = Lepper|year = 1985}}&lt;/ref&gt; Researchers found that partisans from both sides perceived the coverage as being biased in favor of the opposite viewpoint, and believed that the people in charge of the news program held the ideological views of the opposite side.

=== "Musical tapping" study ===
More empirical evidence for naïve realism came from psychologist Elizabeth Newton's "musical tapping study" in 1990. For the study, participants were designated either as "tappers" or as "listeners." The tappers were told to tap out the rhythm of a well-known song, while the "listeners" were asked to try to identify the song. While tappers expected that listeners would guess the tune around 50 percent of the time, the listeners were able to identify it only around 2.5 percent of the time. This provided support for a failure in [[perspective-taking]] on the side of the tappers, and an overestimation of the extent to which others would share in "hearing" the song as it was tapped.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

=== Wall Street Game ===
In 1993, [[Lee Ross|Ross]] and Steven Samuels asked dorm resident advisors to nominate students to participate in a study, and to indicate whether those students were likely to cooperate or defect in the first round of the classic decision-making game called the [[Prisoner's dilemma|Prisoner's Dilemma]]. The game was introduced to subjects in one of two ways: it was either referred to as the "Wall Street Game" or as the "Community Game." The researchers found that students in the "Community Game" condition were twice as likely to cooperate, and that it did not seem to make a difference whether students were previously categorized as "cooperators" versus "defectors." This experiment demonstrated that the game's label exerted more power on how the students played the game than the subjects' personality traits. Furthermore, the study showed that the dorm advisors did not make sufficient allowances for [[Subjectivity|subjective]] interpretations of the game.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

== Consequences ==
Naïve realism causes people to exaggerate differences between themselves and others. Psychologists believe that it can spark and exacerbate conflict, as well as create barriers to [[negotiation]] through several different mechanisms.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

=== Bias blind spot ===
One consequence of naïve realism is referred to as the [[bias blind spot]], which is the ability to recognize [[Cognitive bias|cognitive]] and [[motivation]]al biases in others while failing to recognize the impact of bias on the self. In a study conducted by Pronin, Lin, and Ross (2002), [[Stanford University|Stanford]] students completed a questionnaire about various biases in social judgment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Bias Blind Spot: Perceptions of Bias in Self Versus Others|journal = Personality and Social Psychology Bulletin|date = 2002|pages = 369–381|volume = 28|issue = 3|doi = 10.1177/0146167202286008|first = Emily|last = Pronin|first2 = Daniel Y.|last2 = Lin|first3 = Lee|last3 = Ross}}&lt;/ref&gt; They indicated how susceptible they thought they were to these biases compared to the average student. The researchers found that the participants consistently believed that they were less likely to be biased than their peers. In a follow-up study, students answered questions about their personal attributes (e.g. how considerate they were) compared to those of other students. The majority of students saw themselves as falling above average on most traits, which provided support for a [[cognitive bias]] known as the [[better-than-average effect]]. Next, the students learned that 70 to 80 percent of people fall prey to this bias. When asked about the accuracy of their self-assessments, 63 percent of the students argued that their ratings had been objective, while 13 percent of students indicated they thought their ratings had been too modest.&lt;ref&gt;Moskowitz, G.B.&amp;nbsp;''[https://books.google.com/books?id=_-NLW8Ynvp8C&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q=%22naive%20realism%22&amp;f=false Social Cognition: Understanding Self and Others]''. NY, NY: The Guilford Press, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt;[[File:Naive realism illustration.jpg|363x363px|Fig. 1. Actual views (top), "circle's" perception of views (middle), "triangle's" perception of views (bottom). (Modeled after similar illustrations found in Robinson et al., 1995, and Ross &amp; Ward, 1996.)|frame]]

=== False polarization ===
When an individual does not share our views, the third tenet of naïve realism attributes this discrepancy to three possibilities. The individual either has been exposed to a different set of information, is lazy or unable to come to a rational conclusion, or is under a distorting influence such as bias or self-interest.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; This gives rise to a phenomenon called false polarization, which involves interpreting others' views as more extreme than they really are, and leads to a perception of greater [[Intergroup bias|intergroup]] differences (see Fig. 1).&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; People assume that they perceive the issue objectively, carefully considering it from multiple views, while the other side processes information in [[Top-down and bottom-up design|top-down fashion]].&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;Pronin, E., Puccio, C. T., &amp; Ross, L. (2002). Understanding misunderstanding: Social psychological perspectives. In T. Gilovich, D. Griffin &amp; D. Kahneman (Eds.), ''Heuristics and Biases: The Psychology of Intuitive Judgment.'' Cambridge, UK: Cambridge University Press. {{DOI|10.1017/CBO9780511808098.038}}&lt;/ref&gt; For instance, in a study conducted by Robinson et al. in 1996, pro-life and pro-choice partisans greatly overestimated the extremity of the views of the opposite side, and also overestimated the influence of ideology on others in their own group.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title = The Psychology of Legitimacy: Emerging Perspectives on Ideology, Justice, and Intergroup Relations|url = https://books.google.com/books?id=ZAftFEoLli8C|publisher = Cambridge University Press|date = 2001|isbn = 978-0-521-78699-7|first = John T.|last = Jost|first2 = Brenda|last2 = Major}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Reactive devaluation ===
The assumption that others' views are more extreme than they are can create a barrier for conflict resolution. In a sidewalk survey conducted in the 1980s, pedestrians evaluated a nuclear arms' disarmament proposal (Stillinger et al., 1991).&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Lee (1995). "[https://web.archive.org/web/20160614221816/https://law.stanford.edu/wp-content/uploads/sites/default/files/child-page/370999/doc/slspublic/Reactive%20Devaluation.pdf Reactive Devaluation in Negotiation and Conflict Resolution.]" In Kenneth Arrow, Robert Mnookin, Lee Ross, Amos Tversky, Robert B. Wilson (Eds.).&amp;nbsp;''Barriers to Conflict Resolution''. New York: WW Norton &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt; One group of participants was told that the proposal was made by American President [[Ronald Reagan]], while others thought the proposal came from Soviet leader [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]. The researchers found that 90 percent of the participants who thought the proposal was from Reagan supported it, while only 44 percent in the Gorbachev group indicated their support. This provided support for a phenomenon called [[reactive devaluation]], which involves dismissing a concession from an adversary on the assumption that the concession is either motivated by self-interest or less valuable.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

'''Neva Dell Hunter''' (died January 27, 1978) pioneered the practice of [[aura balancing]], a form of spiritual therapy in which the practitioner works directly with the energy fields surrounding and penetrating the physical body. 

Hunter claimed to have served as a channel (or medium) for a being who was purported to be in touch with Phineas Parkhurst Quimby, an American transcendentalist who developed a form of spiritual healing in the mid-19th century that he called the "Science of the Christ."&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

Hunter was the founder of the Quimby Memorial Library in [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]]. Work on the library began in 1940s during her research and travels, and the library was dedicated in 1963. Its collection included copies of Quimby's manuscripts.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation

In 1976, the center was rededicated as Quimby College, with Hunter as the guest of honor. Quimby College later became [[Southwestern College (Santa Fe, New Mexico)|Southwestern College]].

'''Procedural justice''' is the idea of fairness in the processes that resolve disputes and allocate resources.  One aspect of procedural justice is related to discussions of the [[administration of justice]] and legal proceedings.  This sense of procedural justice is connected to [[due process]] (U.S.), [[fundamental justice]] (Canada), procedural fairness (Australia), and [[natural justice]] (other Common law jurisdictions), but the idea of procedural justice can also be applied to nonlegal contexts in which some process is employed to resolve conflict or divide benefits or burdens. Other aspects of procedural justice can also be found in [[social psychology]] and [[sociology]] issues and [[organizational psychology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Procedural justice concerns the fairness and the [[transparency (humanities)|transparency]] of the processes by which decisions are made, and may be contrasted with [[distributive justice]] (fairness in the distribution of rights or resources), and [[retributive justice]] (fairness in the punishment of wrongs). Hearing all parties before a decision is made is one step which would be considered appropriate to be taken in order that a process may then be characterised as procedurally fair. Some theories of procedural justice hold that fair procedure leads to equitable outcomes, even if the requirements of distributive or [[restorative justice]] are not met.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tyler|first=Tom|author2=Rasinski Kenneth |author3=Spodick Nancy |title=Influence of voice on satisfaction with leaders: Exploring the meaning of process control|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1985|volume=48|pages=72–81|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.48.1.72}}&lt;/ref&gt; It has been suggested that this is the outcome of the higher quality interpersonal interactions often found in the procedural justice process,  which has shown to be stronger in affecting the perception of fairness during conflict resolution.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

== In relation to communication ==
In relation to communication, procedural justice deals with the perceptions of fairness regarding outcomes. It reflects the extent in which an individual perceives that outcome allocation decisions have been fairly made. The use of fair procedures helps communicate that employees are valued members of the group. Procedural Justice can be examined by focusing on the formal procedures used to make decisions. Procedural justice, a subcomponent of [[organizational justice]], is important in communication and in the workplace because it involves fair procedures, it allows the employees to have a say in the decision process, it gives employees fair treatment, and allows them to have more input in the appraisal process. Additionally, research by [[Tom R. Tyler]] and colleagues found that giving disgruntled group members a voice regardless of whether it is instrumental (i.e., a voice that affects the decision-making process) or non-instrumental (i.e., a voice that will not have any weighting on the decision-making process) is sometimes enough for a process to be viewed as fair.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tyler|first=Tom|author2=Degoey Peter |author3=Smith Heather |title=Understanding why the justice of group procedures matters: A test of the psychological dynamics of the group-value model|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1996|volume=70|pages=913–930|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.70.5.913}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Lind|first=Edgar Allen|title=The social psychology of procedural justice|year=1988|publisher=Plenum Press|location=New York}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The ability and right to a voice is linked with feelings of respect and value, which emphasizes the importance of the interpersonal factors of procedural justice.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tyler|first=Tom|author2=Degoey Peter|title=Collective restraint in social dilemmas: Procedural justice and social identification effects on support for authorities|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|year=1995|volume=69|pages=482–497|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.69.3.482 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This is important in the workplace because employees will feel more satisfied and respected, which can help to increase job task and [[contextual performance]]. There is an emphasis on the interpersonal and social aspects of the procedure, which result in employees feeling more satisfied when their voices are able to be heard. This was argued by [[Greenberg and Folger]]. Procedural justice also is a major factor that contributes to the expression of employee [[dissent]]. It correlates positively with managers' upward dissent. With procedural justice there is a greater deal of fairness in the workplace. There are six rules that apply to procedural justice, "Leventhal's rules", are consistence, bias suppression, accuracy, correctability, representativeness, and ethicality. With procedural justice in the workplace and in communication, things need to be fair to everyone, when something is applied it has to be applied to everyone and procedures need to be consistent with the moral and ethical values.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

== Perfect, imperfect, and pure ==
In ''[[A Theory of Justice]]'', philosopher [[John Rawls]] distinguished three ideas of procedural justice:&lt;ref&gt;Rawls, A Theory of Justice, revised edition, Oxford: Oxford University Press 1999 Chapter II, Section 14&lt;/ref&gt;
#''Perfect procedural justice'' has two characteristics: (1) an independent criterion for what constitutes a fair or just outcome of the procedure, and (2) a procedure that guarantees that the fair outcome will be achieved.
#''Imperfect procedural justice'' shares the first characteristic of perfect procedural justice—there is an independent criterion for a fair outcome—but no method that guarantees that the fair outcome will be achieved.
#''Pure procedural justice'' describes situations in which there is no criterion for what constitutes a just outcome other than the procedure itself.

== Models of procedural fairness ==
The theory of procedural justice is controversial, with a variety of views about what makes a procedure fair.  Traditionally these views tend to fall into three main families, which can be called the outcomes model, the balancing model, and the participation model.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

=== Outcomes model ===
The idea of the outcomes model of procedural justice is that the fairness of process depends on the procedure producing correct outcomes.  For example, if the procedure is a criminal trial, then the correct outcome would be conviction of the guilty and exonerating the innocent.  If the procedure were a legislative process, then the procedure would be fair to the extent that it produced good legislation and unfair to the extent that it produced bad legislation.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} This has many limitations. Principally, if two procedures produced equivalent outcomes, then they are equally just according to this model. However, as the next two sections explain, there are other features about a procedure that make it just or unjust. For example, many would argue that a benevolent dictatorship is not (as) just as a democratic state (even if they have similar outcomes).{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

=== Balancing model ===
Some procedures are costly.  The idea of the balancing model is that a fair procedure is one which reflects a fair balance between the costs of the procedure and the benefits that it produces.  Thus, the balancing approach to procedural fairness might in some circumstances be prepared to tolerate or accept false positive verdicts in order to avoid unwanted costs (political) associated with the administration of criminal process.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

=== The participation model ===
The idea of the participation model is that a fair procedure is one that affords those who are affected by an opportunity to participate in the making of the decision.  In the context of a trial, for example, the participation model would require that the defendant be afforded an opportunity to be present at the trial, to put on evidence, cross examination witnesses, and so forth.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

=== Group engagement model ===
Models have also been proposed to understand the psychological basis of justice. One of the more recent of these models is the group engagement model.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Tyler|first=Tom|author2=Blader Steven|title=The group engagement model: Procedural justice, social identity, and cooperative behavior|journal=Personality and Social Psychology Review|year=2003|volume=7|issue=4|pages=349–361|doi=10.1207/s15327957pspr0704_07}}&lt;/ref&gt; The group engagement model (GEM), devised by [[Tom R. Tyler]] and Steven L. Blader, incorporates past psychological theories to explain the underlying psychological processes of procedural justice.  Based on [[social identity theory]] and relational models of procedural justice, this model suggests that a group's procedural justice process influences members' identification with the group, which in turn influences their type of engagement within the group.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

According to the model, group engagement is seen as either mandatory or discretionary behavior. Mandatory behavior is defined by Tyler and Blader as behavior that is required by the group and thus is motivated by incentives and sanctions. Conversely, discretionary behavior is motivated by internal values and  is seen as more cooperative and  therefore ideal within a group.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}} Depending on the procedural justice processes of the group, the social identity of the members will be influenced accordingly and different values will be emphasised. The more a member agrees with the type of procedural justice employed, the more they will identify with their group. This increased identification results in the internalization of the group's values and attitudes for the group member. This creates a circular relationship as the group's procedural justice processes will affect group members' levels of identification and, as a consequence, this level and type of identification will affect their own values of what is fair and unfair. This, in turn, will then affect how the individuals will engage with their group, with higher identification leading to discretionary and more desirable behavior.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

== Due process and natural justice ==
{{main|Due process|Natural justice}}
The idea of procedural justice is especially influential in the law.  In the United States, for example, a concern for procedural justice is reflected in the [[Due process|Due Process]] clauses of the United States Constitution.  In other common law countries, this same idea is sometimes called [[natural justice]].{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

Natural justice generally binds ''both'' public and private entities, while the U.S. concept of due process has a "state action" requirement which means it applies only to [[State (polity)|state]] actors.  But in the U.S., there are analogous concepts like [[fair procedure]] which can bind private parties in their relations with others.{{citation needed|date=June 2015}}

In [[Nazism and race|Nazi ideology]], the '''race-soul''', '''race soul''' or '''racial soul''' ({{lang-de|Rassenseele}}) is a "[m]ystical racial psyche greater than any individual member of the German race".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Michael, Robert |author2=Karin Doerr |year=2002 |title=Nazi-Deutsch/Nazi German: An English Lexicon of the Language of the Third Reich |location=Westport, Connecticut &amp; London |publisher=Greenwood Press |isbn=0-313-32106-X |oclc=47254255 |pages=327}}&lt;/ref&gt; The race-soul was variously believed to be the source of such things as [[justice]] and [[poetry]]; non-[[Aryan race|Aryan]] and mixed races were believed to lack these qualities.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="51033">The study of '''religiosity and intelligence''' explores the link between [[religiosity]] and issues related to [[intelligence]] and educational level (by country and on the individual level). Religiosity and intelligence are both complex topics that include diverse variables, and the interactions among variables are not always well understood. For instance, intelligence is often defined differently by different researchers&lt;ref name="Neisser1998" /&gt; and also all scores from intelligence tests are only estimates of intelligence because concrete measurements, like those of mass or distance, cannot be achieved given the abstract nature of the concept of "[[intelligence]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Haier|first1=Richard|title=The Neuroscience of Intelligence|publisher=Cambridge University Press|isbn=9781107461437|pages=18–19}}&lt;/ref&gt; Religiosity is also complex in that it involves wide variations of interactions of religious beliefs, practices, behaviors, and affiliations in diverse cultures.&lt;ref name="what is religiosity" /&gt;

A meta-analysis found a negative correlation between [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ) and religiosity for western societies, but many of the conducted trials yielded very ambiguous results &lt;ref&gt;https://www.washingtonpost.com/national/on-faith/are-atheists-smarter-than-believers-not-exactly/2013/08/16/34393a2c-069b-11e3-bfc5-406b928603b2_story.html?utm_term=.9257c4340044&lt;/ref&gt;. The correlation was suggested to be a result of nonconformity, more cognitive and less intuitive thinking styles among the less religious, and less of a need for religion as a coping mechanism.&lt;ref name="psr.sagepub.com"&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1177/1088868313497266|title=The Relation Between Intelligence and Religiosity: A Meta-Analysis and Some Proposed Explanations|first1=Miron|last1=Zuckerman|first2=Jordan|year=2013|last2=Silberman|first3=Judith A.|last3=Hall|journal=[[Personality and Social Psychology Review]]|volume=17|pages=325–354}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some studies have shown a correlation between national average IQ and levels of atheism in society,&lt;ref name="intmag"&gt;{{Cite journal

One study suggests that intuitive thinking may be one out of many sources that affect levels of religiosity and that analytical thinking may be one out of many sources that affect disbelief.&lt;ref name="Gervais" /&gt; However, others who have reviewed studies on analytic thinking and nonbelievers suggest that analytical thinking does not imply better reflection on religious matters or disbelief.&lt;ref name="Farias" /&gt;

A global study found that Jews, Christians, religiously unaffiliated persons, and Buddhists have, on average, higher levels of education than the global average.&lt;ref name="Pew2016" /&gt;

Concepts of "intelligence" are attempts to clarify and organize this complex set of phenomena.

[[Intelligence]] is a property of the mind that encompasses many related abilities, such as the capacities to reason, to [[plan]], to solve problems, to think abstractly, to comprehend ideas, to use [[language]], and to learn. There are several ways to more specifically define intelligence. In some cases, intelligence may include traits such as [[creativity]], [[Personality type|personality]], [[character structure|character]], [[knowledge]], or [[wisdom]]. However, some psychologists prefer not to include these traits in the definition of intelligence.&lt;ref name="Neisser1998" /&gt;

A widely researched index or classification of intelligence among scientists is [[intelligence quotient]] (IQ). IQ is a summary index, calculated by testing individuals' abilities in a variety of tasks and producing a composite score to represent overall ability, e.g., [[Wechsler Adult Intelligence Scale]]. It is used to predict educational outcomes and other variables of interest.

Others have attempted to measure intelligence indirectly by looking at individuals' or group's educational attainment, although this risks bias from other demographic factors, such as [[Ageing|age]], [[income]], [[gender]] and cultural background, all of which can affect educational attainment.&lt;ref name=Neisser1998/&gt;

Dissatisfaction with traditional [[IQ tests]] has led to the development of alternative theories. In 1983, [[Howard Gardner]] proposed the [[theory of multiple intelligences]], which broadens the conventional definition of intelligence, to include [[logical]], [[natural language|linguistic]], [[Spatial intelligence (psychology)|spatial]], [[music]]al, [[kinesthetic]], naturalist, intrapersonal and interpersonal intelligences.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

===Religiosity===
{{See also|Religion|Irreligion|Religiosity|Psychology of religion}}

The term [[religiosity]] refers to degrees of religious behaviour, belief, or [[spirituality]]. The measurement of religiosity is hampered by the difficulties involved in defining what is meant by the term. Numerous studies have explored the different components of religiosity, with most finding some distinction between religious beliefs/doctrine, religious practice, and spirituality. Studies can measure religious practice by counting attendance at religious services, religious beliefs/doctrine by asking a few doctrinal questions, and spirituality by asking respondents about their sense of oneness with the divine or through detailed standardized measurements. When religiosity is measured, it is important to specify which aspects of religiosity are referred to.&lt;ref name="what is religiosity"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Holdcroft|first1=Barbara|title=What is Religiosity?|journal=Catholic Education: A Journal of Inquiry and Practice|date=September 2006|volume=10|issue=1|pages=89–103}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Mark Chaves, decades of anthropological, sociological, and psychological research have established that "religious congruence" (the assumption that religious beliefs and values are tightly integrated in an individual's mind or that religious practices and behaviors follow directly from religious beliefs or that religious beliefs are chronologically linear and stable across different contexts) is actually rare. People’s religious ideas are fragmented, loosely connected, and context-dependent, as in all other domains of culture and in life. The beliefs, affiliations, and behaviors of any individual are complex activities that have many sources including culture. As examples of religious incongruence he notes, "Observant Jews may not believe what they say in their Sabbath prayers. Christian ministers may not believe in God. And people who regularly dance for rain don’t do it in the dry season."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chaves|first1=Mark|title=SSSR Presidential Address Rain Dances in the Dry Season: Overcoming the Religious Congruence Fallacy|journal=Journal for the Scientific Study of Religion|date=March 2010|volume=49|issue=1|pages=1–14|doi=10.1111/j.1468-5906.2009.01489.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Demographic studies often show wide diversity of religious beliefs, belonging, and practices in both religious and non-religious populations. For instance, out of Americans who are not religious and not seeking religion, 68% believe in God, 12% are atheists, and 17% are agnostics; as for self-identification of religiosity, 18% consider themselves religious, 37% consider themselves spiritual but not religious, and 42% consider themselves neither spiritual nor religious, while 21% pray every day and 24% pray once a month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://commons.trincoll.edu/aris/files/2011/08/NONES_08.pdf|title=American Nones: The Profile of the No Religion Population|year=2008|publisher=American Religious Identification Survey|accessdate=2014-01-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Pew 2012 breakdown"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/10/09/nones-on-the-rise-religion/ |title=Religion and the Unaffiliated |work="Nones" on the Rise |date=October 9, 2012 |publisher=[[Pew Research Center]]: Religion &amp; Public Life |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Most Nones Believe God"&gt;{{cite web|title=Most of the Religiously Unaffiliated Still Keep Belief in God|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/daily-number/most-of-the-religiously-unaffiliated-still-keep-belief-in-god/|website=Pew Research Center|date=November 15, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Global studies on religion also show diversity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Global Religious Landscape|url=http://www.pewforum.org/2012/12/18/global-religious-landscape-exec/|website=Pew Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Religion and belief in gods are not necessarily synonymous since [[nontheistic religion]]s exist including within traditions like [[Atheism in Hinduism|Hinduism]] and [[Atheism in Christianity|Christianity]]. According to anthropologist Jack David Eller, "atheism is quite a common position, even within religion" and that "surprisingly, atheism is not the opposite or lack, let alone the enemy, of religion but is the most common form of religion."&lt;ref name="Eller"&gt;{{cite book|last=Eller|first=Jack|title=Atheism and Secularity Vol.1: Issues, Concepts, Definitions|year=2010|publisher=Praeger|isbn=9780313351839|editor=Phil Zuckerman|chapter=1. What Is Atheism?}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

==Studies comparing religious belief and IQ==
{{See also|Nations and intelligence}}

In a 2013 meta-analysis of 63 studies, led by Professor Miron Zuckerman, a correlation of -.20 to -.25 between religiosity and IQ was particularly strong when assessing beliefs (which in their view reflects intrinsic religiosity) but the negative effects were less when comparing with behavior (such as church going). They note limitations on this since viewing intrinsic religiosity as being about religious beliefs represents American Protestantism more than Judaism or Catholicism, both of which see behavior as just as important as religious beliefs. They also noted that the available data did not allow adequate consideration of the role of religion type and of culture in assessing the relationship between religion and intelligence. Most of the studies reviewed were American and 87% of participants in those studies were from the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom. They noted, "Clearly, the present results are limited to Western societies." The meta-analysis discussed three possible explanations: First, intelligent people are less likely to conform and, thus, are more likely to resist religious dogma, however this theory was contradicted in mostly atheist societies such as the Scandinavian populations, where the religiosity-IQ relationship still existed. Second, intelligent people tend to adopt an analytic (as opposed to intuitive) thinking style, which has been shown to undermine religious beliefs. Third, Intelligent people may have less need for religious beliefs and practices, as some of the functions of religiosity can be given by intelligence instead. Such functions include the presentation of a sense that the world is orderly and predictable, a sense of personal control and self-regulation and a sense of enhancing self-esteem and belongingness.&lt;ref name="psr.sagepub.com"/&gt;

However, a 2016 re-analysis of the Zuckerman et al study, found that the negative intelligence-religiosity associations were weaker and less generalizable across time, space, samples, measures, and levels of analysis, but still robust. For example, the negative intelligence–religiosity association was insignificant with samples using men, pre-college participants, and taking into account grade point average. When other variables like education and quality of human conditions were taken into account, positive relation between IQ and disbelief in God was reduced.&lt;ref&gt;Webster, Gregory D., and Ryan D. Duffy. "Losing faith in the intelligence–religiosity link: New evidence for a decline effect, spatial dependence, and mediation by education and life quality." Intelligence 55 (2016): 15-27.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Dutton and Van der Linden, the re-analysis had controls that were too strict (life quality index and proximity of countries) and also some of the samples used problematic proxies of religiosity, which took away from the variance in the correlations. As such, the reduction of significance in the negative correlation likely reflected a sample anomaly. They also did observe that the "weak but significant" correlation of -.20 on intelligence and religiosity from the Zuckerman study was also found when comparing intelligence with other variables like education and income.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dutton |first1=Edward |last2=Van der Linden |first2=Dimitri |title=Why is Intelligence Negatively Associated with Religiousness? |journal=Evolutionary Psychological Science |date=16 May 2017 |volume=3 |issue=4 |pages=392–403 |doi=10.1007/s40806-017-0101-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researcher [[Helmuth Nyborg]] and [[Richard Lynn]], [[emeritus]] professor of [[psychology]] at the [[University of Ulster]], compared belief in God and IQs.&lt;ref name="intmag" /&gt;  Using data from a U.S. study of 6,825 adolescents, the authors found that the average IQ of atheists was 6 points higher than the average IQ of non-atheists. The authors also investigated the link between belief in a god and average national IQs in 137 countries. The authors reported a correlation of 0.60 between atheism rates and level of intelligence, which was determined to be "highly statistically significant".&lt;ref name="intmag" /&gt;  (It should be noted that 'belief in a god' is not identical to 'religiosity.' Some nations have high proportions of people who do not believe in a god, but who may nevertheless be highly religious, following non-theistic belief systems such as [[Buddhism]] or [[Taoism]].)

The Lynn et al. paper findings were discussed by Professor Gordon Lynch, from London's Birkbeck College, who expressed concern that the study failed to take into account a complex range of social, economic and historical factors, each of which has been shown to interact with religion and IQ in different ways.&lt;ref name=tele&gt;{{cite news

Dr. David Hardman of London Metropolitan University says: "It is very difficult to conduct true experiments that would explicate a causal relationship between IQ and religious belief." He adds that other studies do nevertheless correlate IQ with being willing or able to question beliefs.&lt;ref name="tele"/&gt;

In a sample of 2307 adults in the US., IQ was found to negatively correlate with self reports of religious identification, private practice or religion, mindfullness, religious support, and fundamentalism, but not spirituality.  The relationships were relatively unchanged after controlling for personality, education, age, and gender, and were typically modest. The study was limited only to Christian denominations. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Lewis |first1=Gary J. |last2=Ritchie |first2=Stuart J. |last3=Bates |first3=Timothy C. |title=The relationship between intelligence and multiple domains of religious belief: Evidence from a large adult US sample |journal=Intelligence |date=November 2011 |volume=39 |issue=6 |pages=468–472 |doi=10.1016/j.intell.2011.08.002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to biopsychologist [[Nigel Barber]], the differences in national IQ are better explained by social, environmental, and wealth conditions than by levels of religiosity. He acknowledges that highly intelligent people have been both religious and nonreligious. He notes that countries with more wealth and better resources tend to have higher levels of non-theists and countries that have less wealth and resources tend to have fewer non-theists. For instance, countries that have poverty, low urbanization, lower levels of education, less exposure to electronic media that increase intelligence, higher incidence of diseases that impair brain function, low birth weights, child malnutrition, and poor control of pollutants like lead have more factors that reduce brain and IQ development than do wealthier or more developed countries.&lt;ref name="Nigel atheists"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Barber|first1=Nigel|title=The Real Reason Atheists Have Higher IQs: Is Atheism a Sign of Intelligence?|url=https://www.psychologytoday.com/blog/the-human-beast/201005/the-real-reason-atheists-have-higher-iqs|publisher=Psychology Today|date=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

===Studies examining theistic and atheistic cognitive style===
The idea that analytical thinking makes one less likely to be religious is an idea supported by some studies on this issue,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gervais |first1=W. M. |last2=Norenzayan |first2=A. |title=Analytic Thinking Promotes Religious Disbelief |journal=Science |date=26 April 2012 |volume=336 |issue=6080 |pages=493–496 |doi=10.1126/science.1215647}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harvard researchers found evidence suggesting that all religious beliefs become more confident when participants are thinking intuitively (atheists and theists each become more convinced). Thus [[wikiversity:reflective thinking|reflective thinking]] generally tends to create more qualified, doubted belief.

The study found that participants who tended to think more reflectively were less likely to believe in a god.&lt;ref name=HarvardIntuition&gt;{{cite journal

The study controlled for personality differences and cognitive ability, suggesting the differences were due to thinking styles – not simply IQ or raw cognitive ability.&lt;ref name=HarvardIntuition/&gt; An experiment in the study found that participants moved towards greater belief in a god after writing essays about how intuition yielded a right answer or reflection yielded a wrong answer (and conversely, towards atheism if [[priming (psychology)|primed]] to think about either a failure of intuition or success of reflection). The authors say it is all evidence that a relevant factor in religious belief is thinking style.&lt;ref name=HarvardIntuition/&gt; The authors add that, even if intuitive thinking tends to increase belief in a god, "it does not follow that reliance on intuition is always irrational or unjustified."&lt;ref name=HarvardIntuition/&gt;

A study by Gervais and Norenzayan&lt;ref name=Gervais&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gervais|first1=W. M.|last2=Norenzayan|first2=A.|title=Analytic Thinking Promotes Religious Disbelief|journal=Science|date=26 April 2012|volume=336|issue=6080|pages=493–496|doi=10.1126/science.1215647|url=http://www2.psych.ubc.ca/~ara/Manuscripts/Science-2012-Gervais-493-6.pdf|accessdate=24 January 2016|pmid=22539725}}&lt;/ref&gt;
reached similar conclusions that intuitive thinking tended to increase intrinsic religiosity, intuitive religious belief and belief in supernatural entities. They also added a causative element, finding that subtly triggering analytic thinking can increase religious disbelief. They concluded that "Combined, these studies indicate that analytic processing is one factor (presumably among several) that promotes religious disbelief." While these studies linked religious disbelief to analytical rather than intuitive thinking, they urged caution in the interpretation of these results, noting that they were not judging the relative merits of analytic and intuitive thinking in promoting optimal decision making, or the merits or validity of religiosity as a whole.

A 2017 study re-analyzed the relationship between intuitive and analytical thinking and its correlation with supernatural belief among three measurements (Pilgrimage setting, supernatural attribution, brain stimulation) and found no significant correlation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Farias |first1=Miguel |last2=van Mulukom |first2=Valerie |last3=Kahane |first3=Guy |last4=Kreplin |first4=Ute |last5=Joyce |first5=Anna |last6=Soares |first6=Pedro |last7=Oviedo |first7=Lluis |last8=Hernu |first8=Mathilde |last9=Rokita |first9=Karolina |last10=Savulescu |first10=Julian |last11=Möttönen |first11=Riikka |title=Supernatural Belief Is Not Modulated by Intuitive Thinking Style or Cognitive Inhibition |journal=Scientific Reports |date=8 November 2017 |volume=7 |issue=1 |doi=10.1038/s41598-017-14090-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Reviewing psychological studies on atheists, Miguel Farias noted that studies concluding that analytical thinking leads to lower religious belief "do not imply that that atheists are more conscious or reflective of their own beliefs, or that atheism is the outcome of a conscious refutation of previously held religious beliefs" since they too have variant beliefs such as in conspiracy theories of the naturalistic variety.&lt;ref name=Farias&gt;{{cite book|last1=Farias|first1=Miguel|editor1-last=Bullivant|editor1-first=Stephen|editor2-last=Ruse|editor2-first=Michael|title=The Oxford Handbook of Atheism|date=2013|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199644659|chapter=30. Psychology of Atheism}}&lt;/ref&gt; He notes that studies on deconversion indicate that a greater proportion of people who leave religion do so for motivational rather than rational reasons, and the majority of deconversions occur in adolescence and young adulthood when one is emotionally volatile.&lt;ref name=Farias /&gt; Furthermore, he notes that atheists are indistinguishable from New Age individuals or Gnostics since there are commonalities such as being individualistic, non-conformist, liberal, and valuing hedonism and sensation.&lt;ref name=Farias /&gt;

Concerning the cognitive science studies on atheists, Johnathan Lanman notes that there are implicit and explicit beliefs which vary among individuals. An individual's atheism and theism may be related to the amount of "credibility enhancing displays" (CRED) one experiences in that those who are exposed more to theistic CRED will likely be theist and those who have less exposure to theistic CRED will likely be atheists.&lt;ref name=Lanman&gt;{{cite book|last1=Lanman|first1=Johnatahn|editor1-last=Bullivant|editor1-first=Stephen|editor2-last=Ruse|editor2-first=Michael|title=The Oxford Handbook of Atheism|date=2013|publisher=Oxford Univ. Press|location=Oxford|isbn=0199644659|chapter=31. Atheism and Cognitive Science}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neurological research on mechanisms of belief and non-belief, using Christians and atheists as subjects, by Harris et al. have shown that the brain networks involved in evaluating the truthfulness of both religious and non religious statements are generally the same regardless of religiosity. However, the activity within these networks differed across the religiosity of statements, with the religious statements activating the insula and anterior cingulate cortex to a greater degree, and the non religious statements activating hippocampal and superior frontal regions to a greater degree.  The areas associated with religious statements are generally associated with salient emotional processing, while areas associated with non religious statements are generally associated with memory.  The association between the salience network and religious statements is congruent with the cognitive theory proposed by Boyer that the implausibility of religious propositions are offset by their salience.  The same neural networks were active in both Christians and atheists even when dealing with "blasphemous statements" to each other's worldviews. Furthermore, it supports the idea that "intuition" and "reason" are not two separate and segregated activities but are intertwined in both theists and atheists.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Harris|first1=Sam|last2=Kaplan|first2=Jonas T.|last3=Curiel|first3=Ashley|last4=Bookheimer|first4=Susan Y.|last5=Iacoboni|first5=Marco|last6=Cohen|first6=Mark S.|last7=Sporns|first7=Olaf|title=The Neural Correlates of Religious and Nonreligious Belief|journal=PLoS ONE|date=1 October 2009|volume=4|issue=10|pages=e7272|doi=10.1371/journal.pone.0007272|pmid=19794914|pmc=2748718}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Miller|first1=Lisa|title=THE BRAIN PROCESSES FACTS AND BELIEFS THE SAME WAY|url=http://www.newsweek.com/brain-processes-facts-and-beliefs-same-way-79125|publisher=Newsweek|date=September 30, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The study found that the individuals' self-reported religious orientation was positively correlated with their perceiving themselves to have greater EI. While the number of religious group activities was positively associated with perceived EI, the number of years of [[church attendance]] was unrelated. Significant positive correlations were also found between level of religious commitment and perceived EI. Thus, the Christian volunteers were more likely to consider themselves emotionally intelligent if they spent more time in group activities and had more commitment to their beliefs.

Tischler, Biberman and McKeage warn that there is still ambiguity in the above concepts. In their 2002 article, entitled "Linking emotional intelligence, spirituality and workplace performance: Definitions, models and ideas for research", they reviewed literature on both EI and various aspect of spirituality. They found that both EI and spirituality appear to lead to similar attitudes, behaviors and skills, and that there often seems to be confusion, intersection and linking between the two constructs.&lt;ref name= tischler&gt;{{cite journal

Recently, Łowicki and Zajenkowski investigated the potential associations between various aspects of religious belief and ability and trait EI. In their first study they found that ability EI was positively correlated with general level of belief in God or a higher power. Their next study, conducted among Polish Christians, replicated the previous result and revealed that both trait and ability EI were negatively related to extrinsic religious orientation and negative religious coping.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Łowicki|first=Paweł|last2=Zajenkowski|first2=Marcin|title=Divine Emotions: On the Link Between Emotional Intelligence and Religious Belief|url=http://rdcu.be/pq5m|journal=Journal of Religion and Health|language=en|doi=10.1007/s10943-016-0335-3|year=2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies exploring religiosity and educational attainment===
{{main|Religiosity and education}}

The relationship between the level of religiosity and one's level of education has been a philosophical, as well as a scientific and political concern since the second half of the 20th century.

The parameters in this field are slightly different compared to those brought forward above: if the "level of religiosity" remains a concept which is difficult to determine scientifically, on the contrary, the "level of education" is, indeed, easy to compile, official data on this topic being publicly accessible to anyone in most countries.

Different studies available show contrasting conclusions. An analysis of [[World Values Survey]] data showed that in most countries, there is no significant relationship between education and religious attendance, with some differences between "Western" countries and former socialist countries, which the authors attribute to historical, political, and economic factors, not intelligence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

A 2016 [[Pew Center]] global study on religion and education around the world ranked [[Jews]] as the most educated (13.4 years of schooling) followed by [[Christians]] (9.3 years of schooling). The [[Irreligion|religiously unaffiliated]]—a category which includes [[atheists]], [[agnostics]] and those who describe their religion as “[[Nothing in Particular|nothing in particular]]”—ranked overall as the third most educated religious group (8.8 years of schooling) followed by [[Buddhists]] (7.9 years of schooling), [[Muslims]] (5.6 years of schooling), and [[Hindus]] (5.6 years of schooling).&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; In the youngest age (25-34) group surveyed, Jews averaged 13.8 years of schooling, the unaffiliated group averaged 10.3 years of schooling, Christians averaged 9.9 years of schooling, Buddhists averaged 9.7 years of schooling, Hindus averaged 7.1 years of schooling, and Muslims averaged 6.7 years of schooling. 61% of Jews, 20% of Christians, 16% of the unaffiliated, 12% of Buddhists, 10% of Hindus, and 8% of Muslims have graduate and [[post-graduate]] degrees.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"/&gt; The study observed that the probability of having a college degree in the U.S. is higher for all religious minorities surveyed (perhaps partly due to selective immigration policies that favor highly skilled applicants), including the unaffiliated group which ranks in the fifth place, being higher than the national average of 39%.&lt;ref name="Pew2016"&gt;{{cite web |date=December 19, 2011 |title=Religion and Education Around the World |url=http://assets.pewresearch.org/wp-content/uploads/sites/11/2016/12/21094148/Religion-Education-ONLINE-FINAL.pdf |publisher=Pew Research Center |accessdate=December 13, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 2016 [[Pew Center]] study, there is correlation between education and income in the United States. About 77% of [[Hindus]], 67% to less than the national average (depending on the size of denominational groups) of Christians, 59% of Jews, 47% of Buddhists, 43% of [[Atheists]], 42% of [[Agnostics]], 39% of Muslims, and 24% of those who say their religion is “[[Nothing in Particular|nothing in particular]]”; have a [[Academic degree|graduate]] and [[post-graduate]] degree.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pewresearch.org/fact-tank/2016/11/04/the-most-and-least-educated-u-s-religious-groups/|title=The most and least educated U.S. religious group|publisher=Pew Research Center|date=2016-10-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Factors that influence IQ==

[[Environment (biophysical)|Environmental]] and [[Heredity|genetic]] factors play a role in determining IQ. Their relative importance has been the subject of much research and debate.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Continuity of Genetic and Environmental Influences on Cognition across the Life Span: A Meta-Analysis of Longitudinal Twin and Adoption Studies|first1=Elliot M|last1=Tucker-Drob|first2=Daniel A|last2=Briley|journal=Psychological Bulletin|year=2014|volume=140|issue=4|pages=949–979|doi=10.1037/a0035893|pmc=4069230|pmid=24611582}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Micronutrients and vitamin deficiencies ===
[[Micronutrient]] deficiencies (e.g. in [[iodine]] and [[iron (element)|iron]]) influence the development of intelligence and remain a problem in the developing world. For example, [[iodine deficiency]] causes a fall, on average, of 12 IQ points.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|author=Qian M |title=The effects of iodine on intelligence in children: a meta-analysis of studies conducted in China |journal=Asia Pacific Journal of Clinical Nutrition |volume=14 |issue=1 |pages=32–42 |year=2005 |pmid=15734706|name-list-format=vanc|author2=Wang D|author3=Watkins WE|display-authors=3|last4=Gebski|first4=V|last5=Yan|first5=YQ|last6=Li|first6=M|last7=Chen|first7=ZP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Heritability ===
{{See also|Heritability of IQ|Environment and intelligence}}

[[Heritability]] is defined as the proportion of [[variance]] in a [[trait (biology)|trait]] which is attributable to [[genotype]] within a defined population in a specific [[environment (biophysical)|environment]]. A number of points must be considered when interpreting heritability.&lt;ref name="lewontin 2"&gt;''International Journal of Epidemiology'', Volume 35, Issue 3, June 2006. See reprint of Leowontin's 1974 article "The analysis of variance and the analysis of causes" and 2006 commentaries: http://ije.oxfordjournals.org/content/35/3.toc&lt;/ref&gt; The general figure for the heritability of IQ, according to an authoritative [[American Psychological Association]] report, is 0.45 for children, and rises to around 0.75 for late [[adolescent]]s and [[adult]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/print/9726 |title=Intelligence: The History of Psychometrics |last1=Aguiar |first1=Sebastian  |date=31 October 2014|website=ieet.org |publisher=Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies |access-date=9 November 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="unknown"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1037/0003-066X.51.2.77 |title=Intelligence: Knowns and unknowns |year=1996 |last1=Neisser |first1=Ulric |last2=Boodoo |first2=Gwyneth |last3=Bouchard |first3=Thomas J.

===Shared family environment===
Family members have aspects of environments in common (for example, characteristics of the home). This shared family environment accounts for 0.25–0.35 of the variation in IQ in childhood. By late adolescence, it is quite low (zero in some studies). The effect for several other psychological traits is similar. These studies have not looked at the effects of extreme environments, such as in abusive families.&lt;ref name=Neisser95 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Bouchard Jr |first1=TJ |title=Genetic and environmental influences on adult intelligence and special mental abilities. |journal=Human biology; an international record of research |volume=70 |issue=2 |pages=257–79 |year=1998 |pmid=9549239}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Plomin0103"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Plomin |first1=R |last2=Asbury |first2=K |last3=Dunn |first3=J |title=Why are children in the same family so different?

Dickens and Flynn (2001) have argued that genes for high IQ initiate an environment-shaping [[feedback|feedback cycle]], with genetic effects causing bright children to seek out more stimulating environments that then further increase their IQ. In Dickens' model, environment effects are modeled as decaying over time. In this model, the [[Flynn effect]] can be explained by an increase in environmental stimulation independent of it being sought out by individuals. The authors suggest that programs aiming to increase IQ would be most likely to produce long-term IQ gains if they enduringly raised children's drive to seek out cognitively demanding experiences.&lt;ref name="DickensFlynn2001"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dickens |first1=William T. |last2=Flynn |first2=James R. |title=Heritability estimates versus large environmental effects: The IQ paradox resolved. |journal=Psychological Review |volume=108 |issue=2 |pages=346–69 |year=2001 |pmid=11381833 |doi=10.1037/0033-295X.108.2.346}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |first1=William T. |last1=Dickens |first2=James R. |last2=Flynn |url=http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/dickens/20020205.pdf |title=The IQ Paradox: Still Resolved |journal=Psychological Review |volume=109 |issue=4 |year=2002 |doi=10.1037/0033-295x.109.4.764 |pages=764–771 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070319031706/http://www.brookings.edu/views/papers/dickens/20020205.pdf |archivedate=2007-03-19 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="36797">'''Representation''' is the use of signs that stand in for and take the place of something else.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995&gt;Mitchell, W. 1995, "Representation", in F Lentricchia &amp; T McLaughlin (eds), ''Critical Terms for Literary Study'', 2nd edn, University of Chicago Press, Chicago&lt;/ref&gt; It is through representation that people organize the world and reality through the act of naming its elements.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt; Signs are arranged in order to form [[semantics|semantic]] constructions and express relations.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt; 
[[Image:Aristoteles Louvre.jpg|thumb|right|[[Bust (sculpture)|Bust]] of [[Aristotle]], Greek philosopher]]
For many philosophers, both ancient and modern, man is regarded as the "representational animal" or ''[[animal symbolicum]]'', the creature whose distinct character is the creation and the manipulation of signs – things that "stand for" or "take the place of" something else.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt;&lt;!--p. 11--&gt;

Representation has been associated with [[aesthetics]] (art) and [[semiotics]] (signs). Mitchell says "representation is an extremely elastic notion, which extends all the way from a stone representing a man to [[Ulysses (novel)|a novel]] representing the day in the life of several Dubliners".&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt;&lt;!--p. 13--&gt;
 
The term 'representation' carries a range of meanings and interpretations. In [[literary theory]], 'representation' is commonly defined in three ways. 
#To look like or resemble
#To stand in for something or someone
#To present a second time; to re-present&lt;ref name=Stadler2005&gt;O'Shaughnessy, M &amp; Stadler J, ''Media and society: an introduction'', 3rd edn, Oxford University Press, South Melbourne, 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

Representation began with early literary theory in the ideas of [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]], and has evolved into a significant component of language, [[Ferdinand de Saussure|Saussurian]] and [[communication]] studies.&lt;ref name=Stadler2005/&gt;

==Defining representation==
[[Image:Mona Lisa, by Leonardo da Vinci, from C2RMF retouched.jpg|thumb|right|''Reproduction of the [[Mona Lisa]]'']]
To represent is "to bring to mind by description," also "to symbolize, to be the embodiment of;" from O.Fr. representer (12c.), from L. repraesentare, from re-, intensive prefix, + praesentare "to present," lit. "to place before".

A representation is a type of recording in which the sensory information about a physical [[Object (philosophy)|object]] is described in a [[Media (arts)|medium]]. The degree to which an artistic representation ''resembles'' the object it represents is a function of resolution and does not bear on the denotation of the word. For example, both the [[Mona Lisa]] and a child's crayon drawing of [[Lisa del Giocondo]] would be considered representational, and any preference for one over the other would need to be understood as a matter of aesthetics.

==History==
[[Image:Tragic comic masks - roman mosaic.jpg|thumb|right|250px|''Greek theatrical masks depicted in [[Hadrian]]s Villa mosaic'']]
Since ancient times representation has played a central role in understanding literature, aesthetics and semiotics. [[Plato]] and [[Aristotle]] are key figures in early literary theory who considered literature as simply one form of representation.&lt;ref name=Childers1995&gt;Childers J (ed.), ''Columbia Dictionary of Modern Literary and Cultural Criticism'', Columbia University Press, New York, 1995&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle for instance, considered each mode of representation, verbal, visual or musical, as being natural to human beings.&lt;ref name=Vukcevich2002&gt;&lt;Vukcevich, M 2002, "Representation", The University of Chicago, viewed 7 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, what distinguishes humans from other animals is their ability to create and manipulate signs.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1990&gt;Mitchell, W, "Representation", in F Lentricchia &amp; T McLaughlin (eds), ''Critical Terms for Literary Study'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago 1990&lt;/ref&gt; Aristotle deemed mimesis as natural to man, therefore considered representations as necessary for people's learning and being in the world.&lt;ref name=Vukcevich2002/&gt; Plato, in contrast, looked upon representation with more caution. He recognised that literature is a representation of life, yet also believed that representations create worlds of illusion leading one away from the [[The Real|"real things"]].&lt;ref name=Hall1997&gt;Hall, S (ed.), ''Cultural Representations and Signifying Practice'', Open University Press, London, 1997.  {{ISBN|978-0761954323}}&lt;/ref&gt; For Plato, representation, like contemporary media, intervenes between the viewer and the real, creating illusions that lead one away from "real things". Plato believed that representation needs therefore, to be controlled and monitored due to the possible dangers resulting in its ability to foster antisocial emotions or encourage the imitation of evil.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1990/&gt;

Aristotle went on to say it was a definitively human activity.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt;
From childhood man has an instinct for representation, and in this respect man differs from the other animals that he is far more imitative and learns his first lessons though imitating things.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt;&lt;!--p. 11--&gt;
Aristotle discusses representation in three ways—
#'''The object:''' The symbol being represented.
#'''Manner:''' The way the symbol is represented.
#'''Means:''' The material that is used to represent it.
The '''means''' of literary representation is [[language]]. An important part of representation is the relationship between what the material and what it represents. The questions arising from this are, "A stone may represent a man but how? And by what and by what agreement, does this understanding of the representation occur?"&lt;ref name=Mitchell1995/&gt;

One apprehends reality only through representations of reality, through texts, discourses, images: there is no such thing as direct or unmediated access to reality. But because one can see reality only through representation it does not follow that one does not see reality at all… Reality is always more extensive and complicated than any system of representation can comprehend, and we always sense that this is so-representation never "gets" reality, which is why human history has produced so many and changing ways of trying to get it.&lt;ref name=Dryer1993&gt;Dryer 1993, cited in O’Shaughnessy &amp; Stadler 2005&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--p. 3--&gt;

Consequently, throughout the history of human culture, people have become dissatisfied with language's ability to express reality and as a result have developed new modes of representation. It is necessary to construct new ways of seeing reality, as people only know reality through representation.&lt;ref name=Dryer1993/&gt; From this arises the contrasting and alternate theories and representational modes of abstraction, realism and modernism, to name a few.

==Contemporary ideas about representation==
It is from Plato’s caution that in the modern era many are aware of political and ideological issues and the influences of representations. It is impossible to divorce representations from culture and the society that produces them. In the contemporary world there exist restrictions on subject matter, limiting the kinds of representational signs allowed to be employed, as well as boundaries that limit the audience or viewers of particular representations. In [[motion picture rating system]]s, M and R rated films are an example of such restrictions, highlighting also society’s attempt to restrict and modify representations to promote a certain set of ideologies and values. Despite these restrictions, representations still have the ability to take on a life of their own once in the public sphere, and can not be given a definitive or concrete meaning; as there will always be a gap between intention and realization, original and copy.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1990/&gt;

Consequently, for each of the above definitions there exists a process of communication and message sending and receiving. In such a system of communication and representations it is inevitable that potential problems may arise; misunderstandings, errors, and falsehoods. The accuracy of the representations can by no means be guaranteed, as they operate in a system of signs that can never work in isolation from other signs or cultural factors. For instance, the interpretation and reading of representations function in the context of a body of rules for interpreting, and within a society many of these codes or conventions are informally agreed upon and have been established over a number of years. Such understandings however, are not set in stone and may alter between times, places, peoples and contexts. How though, does this ‘agreement’ or understanding of representation occur? It has generally been agreed by semioticians that representational relationships can be categorised into three distinct headings: icon, symbol and index.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1990/&gt;

For instance objects and people do not have a constant meaning, but their meanings are fashioned by humans in the context of their culture, as they have the ability to make things mean or signify something.&lt;ref name=Hall1997/&gt; Viewing representation in such a way focuses on understanding how language and systems of knowledge production work to create and circulate meanings. Representation is simply the process in which such meanings are constructed.&lt;ref name=Hall1997/&gt; In much the same way as the post-structuralists, this approach to representation considers it as something larger than any one single representation. A similar perspective is viewing representation as part of a larger field, as Mitchell, saying, "…representation (in memory, in verbal descriptions, in images) not only 'mediates' our knowledge (of slavery and of many other things), but obstructs, fragments, and negates that knowledge"&lt;ref name=Mitchell1994&gt;Mitchell, W, ''Picture Theory'', University of Chicago Press, Chicago, 1994&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--p188--&gt; and proposes a move away from the perspective that representations are merely "objects representing", towards a focus on the relationships and processes through which representations are produced, valued, viewed and exchanged.

==Peirce and representation==
[[Image:Charles Sanders Peirce.jpg|thumb|right|[[Charles Sanders Peirce]]]]
[[Charles Sanders Peirce]] (1839–1914) was an innovative and accomplished logician, mathematician, and scientist, and founded [[pragmatism|philosophical pragmatism]]. Peirce's central ideas were focused on [[logic]] and representation.

===Semiotics and logic===
Peirce distinguished philosophical logic as logic ''per se'' from mathematics of logic. He regarded logic (''per se'') as part of philosophy, as a normative field following esthetics and ethics, as more basic than metaphysics,&lt;ref&gt;On his classifications, see Peirce, C.S. (1903), CP 1.180–202 [http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/cl_o_sci_03.htm Eprint] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111105121054/http://www.princeton.edu/~batke/peirce/cl_o_sci_03.htm |date=2011-11-05 }} and (1906) "The Basis of Pragmaticism" in ''The Essential Peirce'' 2:372–3. For the relevant quotes, see "Philosophy" and "Logic" at ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]'', Bergman and Paavola, editors, U. of Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt; and as the art of devising methods of research.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S., 1882, "Introductory Lecture on the Study of Logic" delivered September 1882, ''Johns Hopkins University Circulars'', vol. 2, no. 19, pp. 11–12, November 1892, ''Google Book Search'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=E0YFAAAAQAAJ&amp;pg=PA11&amp;dq=%22art+of+devising+methods+of+research%22 Eprint]. Reprinted in ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'' v. 7, paragraphs 59–76, ''The Essential Peirce'' 1:214–214; ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'' 4:378–382.&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that, more generally, as inference, "logic is rooted in the social principle", since inference depends on a standpoint that, in a sense, is unlimited.&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1878) "The Doctrine of Chances", ''Popular Science Monthly'', v. 12, pp. 604–615, 1878, reprinted in ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', v. 2, paragraphs 645–668, ''Writings of Charles S. Peirce'' 3:276–290, and ''The Essential Peirce'' 1:142–154. "...death makes the number of our risks, the number of our inferences, finite, and so makes their mean result uncertain. The very idea of probability and of reasoning rests on the assumption that this number is indefinitely great. .... ...logicality inexorably requires that our interests shall not be limited. .... Logic is rooted in the social principle."&lt;/ref&gt;

Peirce held that logic is formal semiotic,&lt;ref name=L75&gt;Peirce, C. S. (written 1902), "MS L75: Logic, Regarded As Semeiotic (The Carnegie application of 1902): Version 1: An Integrated Reconstruction", Joseph Ransdell, ed., ''Arisbe'', see [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/l75/ver1/l75v1-05.htm#m12 Memoir 12].&lt;/ref&gt; the formal study of signs in the broadest sense, not only signs that are artificial, linguistic, or symbolic, but also signs that are semblances or are indexical such as reactions. He held that "all this universe is perfused with signs, if it is not composed exclusively of signs",&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S., ''The Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', v. 5, paragraph 448 footnote, from "The Basis of Pragmaticism" in 1906.&lt;/ref&gt; along with their representational and inferential relations, interpretable by mind or ''quasi-mind'' (whatever works like a mind despite perhaps not actually being one);&lt;ref&gt;See "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/quasimind.html Quasi-Mind]" at the ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'', Mats Bergman and Sami Paavola, eds., University of Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt; the focus here is on sign action in general, not psychology, linguistics, or social studies).

He argued that, since all thought takes time, "all thought is in signs"&lt;ref&gt;Peirce, C.S. (1868), "Questions Concerning Certain Faculties Claimed for Man" (''Arisbe'' [http://www.cspeirce.com/menu/library/bycsp/question/qu-frame.htm Eprint]), ''Journal of Speculative Philosophy'' vol. 2, pp. 103–114. Reprinted (''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', v. 5, paragraphs 213–263, the quote is from paragraph 253).&lt;/ref&gt; and sign processes ("[[semiosis]]") and that the three irreducible elements of semiosis are (1) the ''sign'' (or [[wiktionary:representamen|representamen]]), (2) the (semiotic) ''object'', the sign's subject matter, which the sign represents and which can be anything thinkable&amp;mdash;quality, brute fact, or law&amp;mdash;and even fictional ([[Prince Hamlet]]), and (3) the ''interpretant'' (or interpretant sign), which is the sign's meaning or ramification as formed into a kind of idea or effect that is a further sign, for example, a translation.&lt;ref&gt;For Peirce's definitions of semiosis, sign, representamen, object, interpretant, see the [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''.&lt;/ref&gt; Even when a sign represents by a resemblance or factual connection independent of interpretation, the sign is a sign because it is at least potentially interpretable. A sign depends on its object in a way that enables (and, in a sense, determines) interpretation, forming an interpretant which, in turn, depends on the sign and on the object ''as the sign depends on the object'' and is thus a further sign, enabling and determining still further interpretation, further interpretants. That essentially triadic process is logically structured to perpetuate itself and is what defines sign, object, and interpretant.

An object either (1) is ''immediate'' to a sign, and that is the object as represented in the sign, or (2) is a ''dynamic'' object, which is the object as it really is, on which the immediate object is founded. Usually, an object in question, such as Hamlet or the planet Neptune, is a special or partial object. A sign's total object is the object's [[universe of discourse]], the totality of things in that world to which one attributes the object. An interpretant is either (1) ''immediate'' to a sign, for example a word's usual meaning, a kind of interpretive quality or possibility present in the sign, or (2) ''dyanamic'', an actual interpretant, for example a state of agitation, or (3) ''final'' or ''normal'', a question's true settlement, which ''would'' be reached if thought or inquiry were pushed far enough, a kind of norm or ideal end with which any actual interpretant may, at most, coincide.

Peirce said that, in order to know to what a sign refers, the mind needs some sort of experience of the sign's object, experience outside, and collateral to, the given sign or sign system. In that context he spoke of collateral experience, collateral observation, collateral acquaintance, all in much the same terms.&lt;ref&gt;Ten quotes on collateral observation from Peirce provided by Professor Joseph Ransdell can be viewed [http://lyris.ttu.edu/read/messages?id=57101#57101 here]. Also see pp. 404–409 in "Pragmatism" by Peirce in ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 2.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, art work can exploit both the richness and the limits of the audience's experience; a novelist, in disguising a ''[[roman à clef]]'', counts on the typical reader's lack of personal experience with the actual individual people portrayed. Then the reader refers the signs and interpretants in a general way to an object or objects of the kind that is represented (intentionally or otherwise) by the novel. In all cases, the object (be it a quality or fact or law or even fictional) determines the sign to an interpretant through one's collateral experience with the object, collateral experience in which the object is newly found or from which it is recalled, even if it is experience with an object of imagination as called into being by the sign, as can happen not only in fiction but in theories and mathematics, all of which can involve mental experimentation with the object under specifiable rules and constraints. Through collateral experience even a sign that consists in a chance semblance of an absent object is determined by that object.

Peirce held that logic has three main parts:
# '''Speculative grammar''',&lt;ref name=spec&gt;See "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/grammarspec.html Grammar: Speculative]" in ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; on meaningfulness, conditions for meaning. Study of significatory elements and combinations.
# '''Logical critic''',&lt;ref name=critic&gt;See "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/critic.html Critic]" in ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; on validity, conditions for true representation. Critique of arguments in their various distinct modes.
# '''Speculative rhetoric''', or methodeutic,&lt;ref name=methodeutic&gt;See "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/methodeutic.html Methodeutic]" in ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms''.&lt;/ref&gt; on conditions for determining interpretations. Methodology of inquiry in its mutually interacting modes.

1. '''Speculative Grammar'''. By this, Peirce means discovering relations among questions of how signs can be meaningful and of what kinds of signs there are, how they combine, and how some embody or incorporate others. Within this broad area, Peirce developed three interlocked universal [[Trichotomy (philosophy)|trichotomies]] of signs, depending respectively on (1) the sign itself, (2) how the sign stands for its object, and (3) how the sign stands for its object to its interpretant. Each trichotomy is divided according to the phenomenological category involved: ''Firstness'' (quality of feeling, essentially monadic), ''secondness'' (reaction or resistance, essentially dyadic), or ''thirdness'' (representation or mediation, essentially triadic).&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/categories.html Categories, Cenopythagorean Categories]", ''Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms'', Mats Bergman and Sami Paavola, editors, University of Helsinki.&lt;/ref&gt;
# [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#I. Qualisign.2C sinsign.2C legisign|Qualisigns, sinsigns, and legisigns]]. Every sign is either (qualisign) a [[Quality (philosophy)|quality]] or possibility, or (sinsign) an actual individual thing, fact, event, state, etc., or (legisign) a norm, habit, rule, law.
# [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#II. Icon.2C index.2C symbol|Icons, indices, and symbols]]. Every sign refers either (icon) through similarity to its object, or (index) through factual connection to its object, or (symbol) through interpretive habit or norm of reference to its object.
# [[Semiotic elements and classes of signs (Peirce)#III. Rheme.2C dicisign.2C argument|Rhemes, dicisigns, and arguments]]. Every sign is interpreted either as (rheme) term-like, standing for its object in respect of quality, or as (dicisign) proposition-like, standing for its object in respect of fact, or as (argument) argumentative, standing for its object in respect of habit or law. This is the trichotomy of all signs as building blocks of inference.
{{C. S. Peirce ninefold sign table}} 
Some (not all) sign classes from different trichotomies intersect each other. For example, a qualisign is always an icon, and is never an index or a symbol. He held that there were only ten classes of signs logically definable through those three universal trichotomies.&lt;ref&gt;See ''Collected Papers of Charles Sanders Peirce'', v. 2, paragraphs 254–263, reprinted in ''Philosophical Writings of Peirce'' [https://books.google.com/books?id=ClSjXRIbxAMC&amp;pg=PA115 pp. 115]–118, and in ''The Essential Peirce'' v. 2, pp. 294–296.&lt;/ref&gt; He thought that there were further such universal trichotomies as well. Also, some signs need other signs in order to be embodied. For example, a legisign (also called a type), such as the word "the," needs to be embodied in a sinsign (also called a token), for example an individual instance of the word "the", in order to be expressed. Another form of combination is attachment or incorporation: an index may be attached to, or incorporated by, an icon or a symbol.

Peirce called an icon apart from a label, legend, or other index attached to it, a "hypoicon", and divided the hypoicon into three classes: (a) the ''image'', which depends on a simple quality; (b) the ''diagram'', whose internal relations, mainly dyadic or so taken, represent by analogy the relations in something; and (c) the ''metaphor'', which represents the representative character of a sign by representing a parallelism in something else.&lt;ref&gt;On image, diagram, and metaphor, see "[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/terms/hypoicon.html Hypoicon]" in the ''[http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''.&lt;/ref&gt; A diagram can be geometric, or can consist in an array of algebraic expressions, or even in the common form "All __ is ___" which is subjectable, like any diagram, to logical or mathematical transformations.

2. '''Logical critic''' or Logic Proper. That is how Peirce refers to logic in the everyday sense. Its main objective, for Peirce, is to classify arguments and determine the validity and force of each kind.&lt;ref name=critic/&gt; He sees [[Charles Sanders Peirce#Modes of inference|three main modes]]: [[Abductive reasoning|abductive inference]] (guessing, inference to a hypothetical explanation); [[Deductive reasoning|deduction]]; and [[Inductive reasoning|induction]]. A work of art may embody an inference process and be an argument without being an explicit argumentation. That is the difference, for example, between most of ''[[War and Peace]]'' and its final section.

3. '''Speculative rhetoric''' or methodeutic. For Peirce this is the theory of effective use of signs in investigations, expositions, and applications of truth. Here Peirce coincides with Morris’s notion of pragmatics, in his interpretation of this term. He also called it "methodeutic", in that it is the analysis of the methods used in inquiry.&lt;ref name=methodeutic/&gt;

===Using signs and objects===
Peirce concluded that there are three ways in which signs represent objects. They underlie his most widely known trichotomy of signs:
* Icon
* Index
* Symbol&lt;ref&gt;For Peirce's definitions of icon, index, symbol, and related terms, see the [http://www.helsinki.fi/science/commens/dictionary.html Commens Dictionary of Peirce's Terms]''&lt;/ref&gt;

;Icon
This term refers to signs that represent by resemblance, such as portraits and some paintings though they can also be natural or mathematical. Iconicity is independent of actual connection, even if it occurs because of actual connection. An icon is or embodies a possibility, insofar as its object need not actually exist. A photograph is regarded as an icon because of its resemblance to its object, but is regarded as an index (with icon attached) because of its actual connection to its object. Likewise, with a portrait painted from life. An icon's resemblance is objective and independent of interpretation, but is relative to some mode of apprehension such as sight. An icon need not be sensory; anything can serve as an icon, for example a streamlined argument (itself a complex symbol) is often used as an icon for an argument (another symbol) bristling with particulars.

;Index
Peirce explains that an index is a sign that compels attention through a connection of fact, often through cause and effect. For example, if we see smoke we conclude that it is the effect of a cause – fire. It is an index if the connection is factual regardless of resemblance or interpretation. Peirce usually considered personal names and demonstratives such as the word "this" to be indices, for although as words they depend on interpretation, they are indices in depending on the requisite factual relation to their individual objects. A personal name has an actual historical connection, often recorded on a birth certificate, to its named object; the word "this" is like the pointing of a finger.

;Symbol
Peirce treats symbols as habits or norms of reference and meaning. Symbols can be natural, cultural, or abstract and logical. They depend as signs on how they ''will'' be interpreted, and lack or have lost dependence on resemblance and actual, indexical connection to their represented objects, though the symbol's individual embodiment is an index to your experience of its represented object. Symbols are instantiated by specialized indexical sinsigns. A proposition, considered apart from its expression in a particular language, is already a symbol, but many symbols draw from what is socially accepted and culturally agreed upon. Conventional symbols such as "horse" and ''&lt;span lang=es&gt;caballo&lt;/span&gt;'', which prescribe qualities of sound or appearance for their instances (for example, individual instances of the word "horse" on the page) are based on what amounts to arbitrary stipulation.&lt;ref name=Mitchell1990/&gt; Such a symbol uses what is already known and accepted within our society to give meaning. This can be both in spoken and written language.

For example, we can call a large metal object with four wheels, four doors, an engine and seats a "car" because such a term is agreed upon within our culture and it allows us to communicate.  In much the same way, as a society with a common set of understandings regarding language and signs, we can also write the word "car" and in the context of Australia and other English speaking nations, know what it symbolises and is trying to represent.&lt;ref name=Dupriez1991&gt;Dupriez, B, ''A Dictionary of Literary Devices'', University of Toronto Press, Canada, 1991.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Saussure and representation==
[[Image:Ferdinand de Saussure by Jullien.png|thumb|right|[[Ferdinand de Saussure]]]]
Swiss linguist [[Ferdinand de Saussure]] (1857–1913) played a major role in the development of semiotics with his argument that language is a system of signs that needs to be understood in order to fully understand the process of [[linguistics]].&lt;ref name=Culler1976&gt;Culler, J 1976, ''Saussure'', Fontana Modern Masters, Britain, 1976.&lt;/ref&gt; The study of semiotics examines the signs and types of representation that humans use to express feelings, ideas, thoughts and ideologies.&lt;ref name=Ryder2004&gt;Ryder, M, ''Semiotics: Language and Culture'', 2004 viewed 6 April 2006 see link below&lt;/ref&gt; Although semiotics is often used in the form of [[textual analysis]] it also involves the study of representation and the processes involved with representation.

The process of representation is characterised by using signs that we recall mentally or phonetically to comprehend the world.&lt;ref name=Klarer1998&gt;Klarer, M, ''An Introduction to Literary Studies'', Routledge, London, 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Saussure says before a human can use the word "tree" she or he has to envision the mental concept of a tree.

Two things are fundamental to the study of signs:&lt;ref name=Barry2002&gt;Barry, P, ''Beginning Theory: an Introduction to Literary and Cultural Theory'', Manchester University Press, Great Britain, 2002.&lt;/ref&gt;
#The '''signified:''' a mental concept, and
#The '''signifier:''' the verbal manifestation, the sequence of letters or sounds, the linguistic realisation.
The signifier is the word or sound; the signified is the representation.
 
Saussure points out that signs:
*Are '''arbitrary:''' There is no link between the signifier and the signified
*Are '''relational:''' We understand we take on meaning in relation to other words. Such as we understand "up" in relation to "down" or a dog in relation to other animals, such as a cat.
*'''constitute our world''' – "You cannot get outside of language. We exist inside a system of signs".&lt;ref name=Barry2002/&gt;

Saussure suggests that the meaning of a sign is arbitrary, in effect; there is no link between the signifier and the signified.&lt;ref name=Holdcroft1991&gt;Holdcroft 1991 no details&lt;/ref&gt; The signifier is the word or the sound of the word and the signified is the representation of the word or sound. For example, when referring to the term "sister" (signifier) a person from an English speaking country such as Australia, may associate that term as representing someone in their family who is female and born to the same parents (signified). An [[Australian Aborigines|Aboriginal Australian]] may associate the term "sister" to represent a close friend that they have a bond with. This means that the representation of a signifier depends completely upon a person’s cultural, linguistic and social background. Saussure argues that if words or sounds were simply labels for existing things in the world, translation from one language or culture to another would be easy, it is the fact that this can be extremely difficult that suggests that words trigger a representation of an object or thought depending on the person that is representing the signifier.&lt;ref name=Chandler2001&gt;Chandler, D, ''Semiotics for Beginners: Modality and representation'', viewed 8 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; The signified triggered from the representation of a signifier in one particular language do not necessarily represent the same signified in another language. Even within one particular language many words refer to the same thing but represent different people's interpretations of it. A person may refer to a particular place as their "work" whereas someone else represents the same signifier as their "favorite restaurant".  This can also be subject to historical changes in both the signifier and the way objects are signified.

Saussure claims that an imperative function of all written languages and alphabetic systems is to "represent" spoken language.&lt;ref name=Arnason2006&gt;Arnason, D, Reference material, 2006, viewed 12 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt; Most languages do not have writing systems that represent the [[Phoneme|phonemic sounds]] they make. For example, in English the written letter "a" represents different phonetic sounds depending on which word it is written in. The letter "a" has a different sound in the word in each of the following words, "apple", "gate", "margarine" and "beat", therefore, how is a person unaware of the phonemic sounds, able to pronounce the word properly by simply looking at alphabetic spelling. The way the word is represented on paper is not always the way the word would be represented phonetically. This leads to common misrepresentations of the phonemic sounds of speech and suggests that the [[writing system]] does not properly represent the true nature of the pronunciation of words.

'''Russell Blackford''' is an Australian writer, philosopher, and literary critic, based for many years in [[Melbourne]]. He was born in Sydney, and grew up in the [[city of Lake Macquarie]], near [[Newcastle, New South Wales]]. He moved to Melbourne in 1979, but returned to Newcastle to live and work in 2009.

== Early life and career ==

Blackford graduated with First Class Honours degrees in both Arts and Law from the [[University of Newcastle, Australia|University of Newcastle]] and [[University of Melbourne]] respectively.  He also holds a PhD, also from [[University of Newcastle, Australia|Newcastle]], on the return to myth in modern fictional narrative (as postulated by [[Northrop Frye]]).  More recently, he completed a Master of Bioethics&lt;ref&gt;[http://randjblackford.customer.netspace.net.au/APhilosophyCV.htm Russell Blackford – curriculum vitae]&lt;/ref&gt; and a second PhD program (in philosophy), both at [[Monash University]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://arts.monash.edu.au/philosophy/pgrad/graduates.php Postgraduate completions in Philosophy and Bioethics] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100110221833/http://arts.monash.edu.au/philosophy/pgrad/graduates.php |date=10 January 2010 }}, [[Monash University]].&lt;/ref&gt;

As a fiction writer, Blackford specialises in science fiction, [[fantasy]] and [[horror fiction]]. His work includes four novels published by iBooks, three of them forming an original trilogy (The New John Connor Chronicles) set in the world of the [[Terminator (series)|Terminator]] movies. His non-fiction work frequently deals with issues involving science and society, particularly philosophical [[bioethics]], [[cyberculture]], [[transhumanism]], and the history and current state of the science fiction [[genre]]. His work has appeared in many magazines, journals, and reference books, and has been featured most prominently in ''[[Quadrant (magazine)|Quadrant]]'', a monthly journal of literature and policy. It draws on his academic qualifications in a number of fields.{{Citation needed|date=July 2015}}

Since 2008, he has also been a Fellow of the [[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies]]. He was a speaker at the [[2010 Global Atheist Convention]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ieet.org/index.php/IEET/more/3644/ |title=Implausibility, Transcendence, and Atheism |accessdate=1 February 2010 |last=Blackford |first=Russell |date=10 January 2010 |publisher=[[Institute for Ethics and Emerging Technologies|IEET]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a contributor to ''The Australian Book of Atheism''.&lt;ref&gt;Atheists for Freedom of Speech. pp 299–312 in Bonett, Warren (Editor). 2010.

The '''Sarim''' (sometimes Saarim), or "forest of scholars," was a powerful faction of literati that dominated Middle and Late [[Joseon Dynasty|Joseon]] politics in [[Korea]].

==History of Sarim faction==

===Early beginning===
The philosophical lineage of the Sarim scholars originated from the [[neo-Confucian]] school of [[Gil Jae]] (1353–1419), a [[Goryeo]] scholar who studied under [[Yi Saek]] and [[Jeong Mong-ju]].  After the fall of the Goryeo dynasty, he retreated to his home village refusing to serve the new Joseon dynasty despite [[Taejong of Joseon|King Taejong]]'s request.  Gil Jae concentrated on cultivating a new generation of neo-Confucian scholars including Kim Suk-ja and his son [[Kim Jong-jik]]. 

When [[Seongjong of Joseon|King Seongjong]] became the ninth king of Joseon, he invited Kim Jong-jik and his disciples, who came to be called Sarim scholars, to his court and supported their political growth. They primarily served in so-called [[Three Offices of Joseon|Three Offices]], from which challenged the entrenched "Hungu" officials, who accumulated great power and wealth by supporting [[Sejo of Joseon|King Sejo]] when he usurped the throne from his nephew.

===Struggle with Hungu faction===
{{Main|Korean Literati Purges}}
In their conflict with the established Hungu faction, Sarim faction suffered [[Korean Literati Purges|a series of bloody purges]] during the reigns of [[Yeonsangun]], [[Jungjong of Joseon|Jungjong]], and [[Myeongjong of Joseon|Myeongjong]].  They enjoyed a brief period of power during Jungjong's reign through Kim Gueng-pil's disciple [[Jo Gwangjo|Jo Gwang-jo]], who pursued radical reforms to transform Joseon into idealistic neo-Confucian society. 

However, the Sarim faction, whose origin stems from denial of legitimacy of Joseon dynasty, was vulnerable to Hungu's attacks because it questioned legitimacy of King Sejo's usurpation and primarily engaged in the censorate role against the king and ministers.   After four major purges that saw Jo Gwang-jo and many others executed, the Sarim scholars again retreated to rural villages where they continued to spread their philosophy through local schools called [[seowon]] and maintained their power base through system of [[Hyang'yak]].  
         
While Hungu faction declined over the years without ideological successor to replace it, the Sarim faction maintained its identity through "martydom" of earlier generation and came to dominate the court politics during the reign [[Seonjo of Joseon|Seonjo]].  By this time, Sarim philosophy coalesced around the teachings of the philosophers  [[Yi Hwang]] and [[Yi I]].  Since then, the Sarim faction maintained political power for much of Joseon dynasty.

===Factional struggle===
After Sarim faction replaced Hungu faction as the predominant political force in late 16th century, a nationwide split occurred between the Eastern faction (''Dong-in'') and Western faction (''Seo-in''). Political divisions intensified even further as the Eastern faction in turn split between the hard-line Northern faction (''Buk-in'') and the moderate Southern faction (''Nam-in'') and the Western factions split between the Old Doctrine(''Noron'') and the Young Doctrine(''Soron'').

These factional splits grew out of allegiance to different philosophical schools and regional differences.  For instance, Eastern faction was largely Yeongnam-based, and its subfaction Southerners were mainly followers of [[Yi Hwang]] while Northerners coalesced around the school of Jo Shik. Gyeonggi and Chungcheong-based Western faction were largely followers of [[Yi I]], of which followers of Seong Hon split to form Soron faction while [[Song Siyeol]]'s followers became Noron faction.  These divisions were often further driven by questions concerning royal succession or appropriate royal conduct.  The factions were often named after relative location of its leader's house.

====Easterners vs Westerners====
{{Main|Westerners (Korean political faction)|Easterners}}

In the initial split of Sarim into the Western and Eastern factions, there was a large element of generational conflict. The Westerners were largely older Sarim scholars who entered politics during [[Myeongjong of Joseon|Myeongjong]]'s reign while the Easterners, led by Kim Hyo-won (김효원) were mainly younger generation who became officials in Seonjo's reign and saw themselves uncorrupted by excesses of Myeongjong's era, which was marred by his maternal uncle Yoon Won-hyeong's corruption.  

The Westerners were led by Shim Eui-gyeom (심의겸), Myeongjong's brother-in-law whose house was on the west of the palace.  Although Sarim scholars were usually hostile to royal in-laws as corrupting influence, Shim was [[Yi Hwang]]'s disciple and protected Sarim scholars by impeaching his uncle who was planning another literati purge.  In addition, many Westerners were disciples of [[Yi I]] and Seong Hon and followers of Giho school while many Easterners were disciples of [[Yi Hwang]] and Jo Shik and followers of Youngnam School.  Easterners emphasized moral purification of the ruling class and rooting out corruption of earlier period while Westerners emphasized reforms that would strengthen the country and improve livelihood.  (Easterners blamed Shim Eui-gyeom's ill-willed opposition to Kim Hyo-won's appointment at a key position in Ministry of Personnel for split  while Westerners blamed Easterner's self-righteous attack.)  [[Yi I]] attempted to prevent the factional split by appointing Shim Eui-gyeom and Kim Hyo-won to provincial posts far away from the court and arranging truce between Easterner Yi Bal and Westerner [[Jeong Cheol]].  After Yi I's death, however, the conflict between two factions became more intense as the Easterners impeached Shim Eui-gyeom and Jeong Cheol, leading to their dismissal, and gained upper hand.   

In 1589, Easterner Jeong Yeo-rip was accused of treason because he formed a society with his supporters that met each month to study and receive military training.  History of the Sarim after its split is very complicated because there is a wealth of conflicting historical accounts written by each faction.  This is especially true with what became known as Gichuk [[Treason Case of 1589]] (기축옥사), the bloodiest purge in Joseon history by far.  There is still a dispute about the nature and purpose of Jeong Yeo-rip's group of armed supporters and whether it was treason or frame up.  His group was not a secret society as it helped the local government to help fight against the Japanese marauders.  On the other hand, it appears that Jeong truly had revolutionary ideas that was close to republicanism.  He believed that the world was something to be shared and therefore there could not be one master. His group, called "Great Common Society"(대동계), could be joined by anyone regardless of one's social status, and it spread throughout Honam province and to other regions as well.  In any case, Jeong Yeo-rip committed suicide after his arrest was ordered, which was considered the admission of guilt, and letters of Easterners were discovered from his house.  
[[Jeong Cheol]], famous poet and head of the Western faction, was in charge of investigating the case and used the case to effect widespread purge of Easterners who had slightest connection with Jeong Yeo-rip.  According to Easterners' accounts, Jeong Cheol tortured even 80-year-old mother and 8-year-old son of Yi Bal, leader of Eastern faction.  According to Westerner's accounts, Jeong Cheol tried heroically to save Yi Bal and Choe Yeong-gyeong from Seonjo's wrath.  In any event, 1,000 Easterners were killed or exiled in the aftermath.  It is also believed that Seonjo used this incident to weaken the Sarim's power.

====Northerners vs. Southerners====
This incident put the Westerners in power, but did not last long because of intrigue involving the appointment of the crown prince, which put the Easterners back in power for thirty years.  The Eastern faction soon split into hardline Northern faction (''Buk-in''), which wanted to put Jeong Cheol and other Westerners to death, and moderate Southern faction (''Nam-in''), which did not want a wholesale purge.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (1984), p. 221.&lt;/ref&gt;  The Northerners were largely disciples of Jo Shik and [[Seo Gyeong-deok]] and suffered more from Jeong Yeo-rip's "rebellion" while the Southerners were largely Yi Hwang's disciples and less affected.  

The [[Southerners (Korean political faction)|Southerners]], led by [[Yu Seong-ryong]], were initially in power after Japanese Invasion in 1592, and maintained the policy of coexistence with Northerners and Westerners until its effort to reach peace agreement with Japan failed.  The Northerners, now in power, split again over the proper successor to Seonjo, who had no legitimate son.  Greater Northern faction supported [[Gwanghaegun]] while Lesser Northern faction supported another prince.  During Gwanghaegun's reign, Greater Northern faction split further and persecuted other factions until Southerners and Westerners joined their forces in a coup d'état that deposed Gwanghaegun and placed [[Injo of Joseon|Injo]] on the throne.  
With the Westerners back in power, Joseon politics entered more stable stage in which they competed with Southerners in relatively peaceful coexistence for about 100 years.  But under [[Hyojong of Joseon|Hyojong]]'s reign, the Western faction was becoming more powerful.

====Sukjong's reign====
In the early years of [[Sukjong of Joseon|Sukjong]]'s reign, the Southern faction and Western faction clashed over Royal Funeral Dispute, a seemingly minor issue regarding mourning period for Queen Insun. The Southern faction claimed that mourning period should last one year while Western faction argued for a nine-month mourning period. A one-year mourning period meant that Hyojong was considered the eldest son while 9-month period would suggest that Hyojong was considered not the eldest son, following the rules that governed the yangban class. In other words, Western faction viewed the royal family as the first of yangban class rather than a separate class for which different rules applied. The two factions were also in conflict over issue of fighting Qing Dynasty, which was considered barbarian country (as opposed to Ming Dynasty) that threatened Joseon's national security. Southern faction, led by Huh Jeok and Yoon Hyu, supported war against Qing while Western faction wanted to focus first on improving domestic conditions.  Under Sukjong's reign the factional fight became more intense and deadly since Sukjong frequently replaced faction in power with another one to strengthen the royal authority. With each change of government, which was called hwanguk (환국 換局), literally turn of the state, the losing faction was completely driven out of politics with executions and exiles.

====Westerners vs. Southerners====
Sukjong at first sided with the Southern faction, but in 1680, Huh Jeok was accused of treason by Western faction, which led to execution of Huh Jeok and Yoon Hyu and purge of Southern faction. This incident is called Kyungshin hwanguk (경신환국). Now in power, Western faction split into Noron (Old Doctrine) faction, led by [[Song Siyeol]], and Soron (New Doctrine) faction, led by Yoon Jeung. After nine years in power, Noron collapsed when Sukjong deposed Queen Inhyeon, who was supported by Western faction, and named Consort Hee of Jang clan (or Consort Jang) as the new queen. Western faction angered Sukjong when it opposed the naming of Consort Jang's son as crown prince. Southern faction, who supported Consort Jang and her son, regained power and drove out Western faction, executing Song Siyeol in revenge. This is called Gisa hwangguk (기사환국).

Five years later in 1694, Southern faction was planning another purge of Western faction, accusing them of conspiracy to reinstate deposed Queen Inhyeon, when Sukjong began to regret deposing Queen Inhyeon and favor Consort Suk of Choi clan (Consort Choi), an ally of Queen Inhyeon and Noron faction. Angry with Southern faction's attempt to purge Westerners, Sukjong abruptly turned around to purge Southerners and brought the Western faction back in power. The Southern faction would never recover from this blow, also called Gapsul hwanguk (갑술환국). Sukjong demoted Queen Jang to Consort Jang and reinstated Queen Inhyeon. Consort Jang was eventually executed (with poison) for cursing Queen Inhyeon after the latter died. Soron faction supported the crown prince, Consort Jang's son, while Noron faction supported Consort Choi's son, Yeonying-gun (later to become [[Yeongjo of Joseon|Yeongjo]]). Late Queen Inhyeon and newly installed Queen Inwon were childless.

====Soron vs. Noron====
In 1718, Sukjong let the crown prince, soon to be [[Gyeongjong of Joseon|Gyeongjong]], rule the country as a regent. He died in 1720 supposedly after telling Yi Yi-myoung to name Yeonying-gun as Kyungjong's heir, but in absence of histriographer or recorder. This will would lead to yet another purge which led to execution of four Noron leaders in 1721, followed by another purge with executions of eight Noron people in 1722.

Under the reigns of [[Yeongjo of Joseon|Yeongjo]] and [[Jeongjo of Joseon|Jeongjo]] in the 18th century, the kings pursued a strict policy of equality, favoring no faction over another.&lt;ref&gt;Lee (1984), p. 223.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, in Jeongjo's reign, strife re-emerged as the ruling Noron faction split further between the [[Byeokpa]] and [[Sipa (Korean Faction)|Sipa]], two groups which cut across the earlier factions and differed in their attitudes concerning Yeongjo's murder of his son, who was also Jeongjo's father.

===Decline===
The division and subsequent conflict of these factions generally revolved around minor issues and reflected dogmatic and rigid nature of their philosophical interpretations. Sarim philosophy, which was progressive in [[Jo Gwang-jo]]'s time, became very conservative and fundamentalist over time.  The power struggle between these factions were marked by bloody purges with each change of power and resulted in a vicious cycle of revenge. The minor issues that divided these factions distracted the officials from real problems that affected the populace.  Nevertheless, factional conflicts had some positive side as well. Compared to the late [[Jungjong of Joseon|Jungjong]] and [[Myeongjong of Joseon|Myeonjong]] periods, corruption was limited since any faction engaged in excessive corruption would become an easy target for impeachment by its rival faction.  Sukjong's reign, which saw some of the most intense factional struggles since Seonjo and Gwanghaegun's time, was one of more prosperous periods for the populace.  

In the 19th century, Joseon politics shifted as in-law families rather than scholarly factions came to dominate the throne.  For most of the 19th century, the Jangdong branch of the Andong [[Kim (Korean name)|Kim]] clan was in control of the government, which led to rampant corruption throughout the country.

[[File:Free Library of Philadelphia, Lewis E 170, 1r.jpg|thumb|The opening of the ''Book of Sentences'' in a 14th-century manuscript (Free Library of Philadelphia, Lewis E 170, fol. 1r)]]
'''''The Four Books of Sentences''''' ('''''Libri Quattuor Sententiarum''''') is a book of [[theology]] written by [[Peter Lombard]] in the 12th century. It is a systematic compilation of theology, written around 1150; it derives its name from the ''[[Sententia|sententiae]]'' or authoritative statements on biblical passages that it gathered together.

==Origin and characteristics==

[[Image:Petrus Lombardus Sententiarum.JPG|thumb|200px|An 1841 Latin edition of the ''Sentences'' bound together with Aquinas' ''[[Summa Theologica]].'']]
The ''Book of Sentences'' had its precursor in the [[gloss (annotation)|gloss]]es (an explanation or interpretation of a text, such as, e.g. the ''[[Corpus Iuris Civilis]]'' or biblical) by the masters who lectured using [[Saint Jerome]]'s Latin translation of the Bible (the [[Vulgate]]). A gloss might concern syntax or grammar, or it might be on some difficult point of doctrine. These glosses, however, were not continuous, rather being placed between the lines or in the margins of the biblical text itself. Lombard went a step further, collecting texts from various sources (such as Scripture, [[Augustine of Hippo]], and other Church Fathers) and compiling them into one coherent whole. In order to accomplish this, he had to address two tasks: first, that of devising an order for his material, because systematic theology had not yet been constituted as a discipline, and secondly, finding ways to reconcile doctrinal differences among his sources. [[Peter Abelard]]'s [[Sic et Non]] provided crucial inspiration for the latter tasks.

Lombard arranged his material from the Bible and the Church Fathers in four books, then subdivided this material further into chapters. Probably between 1223 and 1227, [[Alexander of Hales]] grouped the many chapters of the four books into a smaller number of "distinctions". In this form, the book was widely adopted as a theological textbook in the high and late Middle Ages (the 13th, 14th, and 15th centuries). A commentary on the ''Sentences'' was required of every master of theology, and was part of the examination system. At the end of lectures on Lombard's work, a student could apply for bachelor status within the theology faculty.

The importance of the ''Sentences'' to medieval theology and philosophy lies to a significant extent in the overall framework they provide to theological and philosophical discussion. All the great scholastic thinkers, such as [[Aquinas]], [[William of Ockham|Ockham]], [[Bonaventure]], and [[John Duns Scotus|Scotus]], wrote commentaries on the ''Sentences''. But these works were not exactly commentaries, for the ''Sentences'' was really a compilation of sources, and Peter Lombard left many questions open, giving later scholars an opportunity to provide their own answers.

A '''subject-matter expert''' ('''SME''') or '''domain expert''' is a person who is an authority in a particular area or topic. The term ''domain expert'' is frequently used in [[expert systems]] software development, and there the term always refers to the domain other than the software domain. A domain expert is a person with special knowledge or skills in a particular area of endeavour (e.g. an [[accountant]] is an expert in the domain of [[accountancy]]). The development of [[accounting software]] requires knowledge in two different domains: accounting and software. Some of the development workers may be experts in one domain and not the other.

==Function==
In general, the term is used when developing materials (a book, an examination, a manual, etc.) about a topic, and expertise on the topic is needed by the personnel developing the material. For example, [[Test (student assessment)|tests]] are often created by a team of [[psychometrics|psychometricians]] and a team of SMEs. The psychometricians understand how to engineer a test while the SMEs understand the actual content of the exam. Books, manuals, and technical documentation are developed by [[technical writer]]s and [[instructional designer]]s in conjunctions with SMEs. Technical communicators interview SMEs to extract information and convert it into a form suitable for the audience. SMEs are often required to sign off on the documents or training developed, checking it for technical accuracy. SMEs are also necessary for the development of training materials.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nwlink.com/~donclark/hrd/sme.html Subject matter experts and training]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Software===
In [[software engineering]] environments, the term is used to describe professionals with expertise in the field of application. The term ''SME'' also has a broader definition in engineering and [[high tech]] as one who has the greatest expertise in a technical topic. SMEs are often asked to review, improve, and approve technical work; to guide others; and to teach. According to [[Six Sigma]] an SME "exhibits the highest level of expertise in performing a specialized job, task, or skill of broad definition."&lt;ref&gt;

|title= Subject Matter Expert
|publisher= iSixSigma
|accessdate = 2012-03-21
}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

In pharmaceuticals and biotechnology areas, ASTM standard E 2500{{citation needed|date=October 2012}} specifies SMEs for various functions in project and process management. SME is defined as an individual who is an expert on that subject. In one project, there will be many SMEs who are experts on air, water, utilities, process machines, process, packaging, storage, distribution and supply chain management, to name a few.

In software development, as in the development of "complex computer systems" (e.g., [[artificial intelligence]], [[expert system]]s, control, simulation, or business software) an SME is a person who is knowledgeable about the domain being represented (but often not knowledgeable about the programming technology used to represent it in the system). The SME tells the software developers what needs to be done by the computer system, and how the SME intends to use it. The SME may interact directly with the system, possibly through a simplified interface, or may codify [[domain knowledge]] for use by [[knowledge engineering|knowledge engineers]] or [[Ontology (information science)|ontologists]]. An SME is also involved in validating the resulting system. SME has formal meaning in certain contexts such as [[Capability Maturity Model|CMMs]].

===Electronic discovery===
In [[electronic discovery]] environments, the term "SME" labels [[professional]]s with expertise using Computer Assisted Review technology (CAR)/Technology Assisted Review (TAR) to perform searches designed to produce precisely refined results that identify groups of data as potentially responsive or non-responsive to relevant issues. E-discovery SMEs also typically have experience in constructing the search strings used in the search process.

===Law===
A lawyer in an administrative agency may be designated an SME if he or she specializes in a particular field of law, such as tort, intellectual property rights etc.

===Engineering===
In engineering and technical field, an SME is the one who is an authority in the design concept, calculations and performance of a system or process.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5732">Within the realm of [[social psychology]], the '''proximity principle''' accounts for the tendency for individuals to form interpersonal relations with those who are close by. [[Theodore Newcomb]] first documented this effect through his study of the acquaintance process, which demonstrated how people who interact and live close to each other will be more likely to develop a relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Newcomb, T.M. (1960). Varieties of interpersonal attraction. In D. Cartwright &amp; A. Zander (Eds.), "Group dynamics: Research and theory" (2nd ed., pp. 104-119).&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Leon Festinger]] also illustrates the proximity principle and propinquity (the state of being close to someone or something) by studying the network of attraction within a series of residential housing units at Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT).&lt;ref&gt;Festinger, L., Schachter, S., &amp; Bach, K. (1950). "Social pressures in informal groups". New York: Harper.&lt;/ref&gt;  Both of these studies provide evidence to support the fact that people who encounter each other more frequently tend to develop stronger relationships.
 
There are two main reasons why people form groups with others nearby rather than people further away.  First, human beings like things that are familiar to them. Second, the more people come into contact with one another, the more likely the interaction will cultivate a relationship.  Also, proximity promotes interaction between individuals and groups, which ends up leading to liking and disliking between the groups or individuals.  The aforementioned idea is accurate only insofar as the increased contact does not unveil detestable traits in either person.  If detestable traits are unveiled, familiarity will in fact breed contempt.  It could be that interaction, rather than propinquity, that creates attraction.&lt;ref&gt;Ebbesen, E. B., Kjos, G. L., &amp; Konecni, V. J. (1976). Spatial ecology: Its effects on the choice of friends and enemies. ''Journal of Experimental Social Psychology, 12,'' 505–518.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Applied Science==
This concept of proximity is applicable to one’s everyday life since it has some dictation over the people one will meet and befriend within their life, as outlined in the aforementioned studies. The formation of friendships was further studied utilizing the population of 336 adolescents within a small and geographically isolated Swedish town.&lt;ref&gt;Preciado, P., Snijders, T., Burk, W.J., Stattin, H., Kerr, M. (2011). Does proximity matter? Distance dependence of adolescent friendships. ''Social Networks, 34,'' 18-31.&lt;/ref&gt; Through the completion of their study, the researchers concluded that social foci that provide constant and continual interaction among the same participants yielded a strong effect on friendship formation. The most notable social foci included attending the same school or one’s own neighborhood, as these are both settings in which one is within a close proximity to the same people on numerous occasions.

In contrast, going to separate schools does not provide one the opportunity to meet the students of that school and therefore one would not be able to formulate a friendship with that person. However, this instance is mitigated if two people from differing schools live in the same neighborhood and therefore are still provided the opportunity of continuous contact outside of school.

==Proximity in the Digital Age==
With the increasing use of technological-based communication, it is important to reflect on the impact this may have on the proximity principle. This form of computer-based communication allows people to interact with others disregarding the constraints of physical distance, however it is “reported that a majority of social network site postings they sampled occurred between people living in the same state, if not the same city”.&lt;ref&gt;Amichai-Hamburger, Y., Kingsbury, M., Schneider, B.H. (2012). Friendship: An old concept with a new meaning? ''Computers in Human Behavior, 29,'' 33-39.&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it appears that computer-based communication increases the ability for people to communicate, but is often only utilized between those who already know each other through pre-existing circumstances.

Although this article is focused on the Proximity aspect of the Principles of Attraction, it is important to note other principles.  These are not in any specific order, but they are an important to consider to fully understand the principles of 
attraction.  The other principles are, The Elaboration Principle, The Similarity Principle, The Complementarity Principle, The Reciprocity Principle, and the Minimax Principle.

'''Titiksha''' or ''titikșā'' ([[Sanskrit]]: तितिक्षा 'forbearance'&lt;ref&gt;Feuerstein 2011&lt;/ref&gt;) is defined by the ''[[Hamsa Gita|Uddhava Gita]]'' as the "patient endurance of suffering."&lt;ref&gt;Chapter 14, Verse 36&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Vedanta philosophy]] it is the bearing with indifference all opposites such as pleasure and pain, heat and cold, expectation of reward and punishment, accruement or gain and loss, resentment and sorrow, fame and obscurity, lavishness and obeisance, pride and egotism, callous and altruism, virtue-respect and vice-respect, birth and death, happiness, safety, comfort, restlessness and boredom, affection or infatuation and bereavement, attachment and desire etc. Being entirely responsible for encouragement and/or reproach for ones own personal behavior, past behavior, frame of mind and esteem. It is one of the six qualities, devotions, jewels or divine bounties beginning with [[Samatva|Sama]], the repression, alleviating or release of the inward sense called [[Manas (Vedanta philosophy)|Manas]]. Another quality is [[Temperance (virtue)#Hinduism|Dama]], the renunciation of behaviors or utilizing self-control with moderation, with correct discrimination and without aversion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Vedanta Philosophy of Shankaracharya|author=Charles Johnston|publisher=Kshetra Books|page=281|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=FHumBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA281&amp;dq=titiksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=F_tEVKjOH4y-uASOnYCoBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=titiksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
[[Adi Shankara|Shankara]] defines Titiksha in the following words: 

:सहनं सर्वदुःखानामऽप्रतिकारपूर्वकम् |
:चिन्ताविलापरहितं सा तितिक्षा निगद्यते ||

:"Endurance of all afflictions without countering aids, and without anxiety or lament is said to be ''titiksha''." ([[Vivekachudamani]] 25)

By speaking of ''titiksha'' as endurance without anxiety or lament and without external aids, Shankara refers to such ''titiksha'' as the means to inquiry into [[Brahman]], for a mind which is subject to anxiety and lament is unfit for conducting this kind of inquiry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sri Sankara’s Vivekacudamani|publisher=Bharatiya Vidya Bhavan|page=39|url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Vivekananda]] explains that forbearance of all misery, without even a thought of resisting or driving it out, without even any painful feeling in the mind, or any remorse is ''titiksha''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda (Vol.1)|publisher=Kartindo|page=360|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=q8uMAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA360&amp;dq=titiksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=htNFVIDqCMeCuwSZnIHIBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=titiksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The practice of [[Yoga]] makes a person inwardly even-minded and cheerful. The very act of calming emotional reactions develops a better ability to influence outer circumstances, therefore, ''titiksha'' does not make one apathetic or dull; it is the first step to interiorizing the mind, and to bringing its reactions under control. The important way of practicing ''titiksha'' is to watch the breath (''parahara'') which practice leads to the practice of meditation proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Super Consciousness: A Guide to Meditation|author=J.Donald Walters|publisher=Motilal Banarsidass|page=193|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GNAeqMLtYyEC&amp;pg=PA193&amp;dq=titiksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=htNFVIDqCMeCuwSZnIHIBQ&amp;redir_esc=y#v=onepage&amp;q=titiksha&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Prakrti]] (matter or nature) shows the way to titiksha, the creative principle of life – just as inertia is a property of matter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Hinduism and Its Dynamism|author=Raushan Nath|publisher=D.K.Publishers|page=13|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=oXTXAAAAMAAJ&amp;q=titiksha&amp;dq=titiksha&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=htNFVIDqCMeCuwSZnIHIBQ&amp;redir_esc=y }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:David - The Death of Socrates.jpg|right|thumb|300px|''[[The Death of Socrates]]'' (1787), by [[Jacques-Louis David]]]]

The '''trial of Socrates''' (399 BC) was held to determine the philosopher’s guilt of two charges: ''[[Impiety|asebeia]]'' (impiety) against the [[Pantheon (religion)|pantheon]] of Athens, and corruption of the youth of the city-state; the accusers cited two impious acts by Socrates: “failing to acknowledge the gods that the city acknowledges” and “introducing new deities”.

The death sentence of [[Socrates]] was the legal consequence of asking politico-philosophic questions of his students, from which resulted the two accusations of moral corruption and of impiety. At trial, the majority of the ''[[dikast]]s'' (male-citizen jurors chosen by lot) voted to convict him of the two charges; then, consistent with common legal practice, voted to determine his punishment, and agreed to a sentence of death to be executed by Socrates’s drinking a poisonous beverage of [[Conium maculatum|hemlock]].

Primary-source accounts of the trial and execution of Socrates are the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology of Socrates]]'' by [[Plato]] and the ''[[Apology (Xenophon)|Apology of Socrates to the Jury]]''  by [[Xenophon of Athens]], who had been his student; contemporary interpretations include ''The Trial of Socrates'' (1988) by the journalist [[I. F. Stone]], and ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths'' (2009) by the Classics scholar [[Robin Waterfield]].&lt;ref&gt;Stone, I.F. (1988). The Trial of Socrates. New York: Little, Brown. Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths by Robin Waterfield, Norton, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
{{Socrates}}
Before the philosopher Socrates was tried for moral corruption and impiety, the citizens of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] knew him as an intellectual and moral gadfly of their society. In the comic play, ''[[The Clouds]]'' (423 BC), [[Aristophanes]] represents Socrates as a [[Sophism|sophistic]] philosopher who teaches the young man Pheidippides how to formulate arguments that justify striking and beating his father. Despite Socrates denying he had any relation with the Sophists, the playwright indicates that Athenians associated the philosophic teachings of Socrates with [[Sophism]]. As philosophers, the Sophists were men of ambiguous reputation, “they were a set of charlatans that appeared in Greece in the fifth century BC, and earned ample livelihood by imposing on public credulity: professing to teach virtue, they really taught the art of fallacious discourse, and meanwhile propagated immoral practical doctrines.”&lt;ref&gt;Kerferd, G.B.''The Sophistic Movement''. New York: Cambridge University Press, 2009.6.&lt;/ref&gt;

Besides ''The Clouds'', the comic play ''[[The Wasps]]'' (422 BC) also depicts inter-generational conflict, between an older man and a young man. Such representations of inter-generational social conflict among the men of Athens, especially in the decade from 425 to 415 BC, can reflect contrasting positions regarding opposition to or support for the Athenian invasion of Sicily.&lt;ref&gt; name=Waterfield&gt;Waterfield, Robin. ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths''. New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; Many Athenians blamed the teachings of the Sophists and of Socrates for instilling the younger generation with a morally nihilistic, disrespectful attitude towards their society.

Socrates left no written works, but his student and friend, [[Plato]], wrote [[Socratic dialogue]]s, featuring Socrates as the protagonist. As a teacher, competitor intellectuals resented Socrates’s ''elenctic examination'' method for intellectual enquiry, because its questions threatened their credibility as men of [[wisdom]] and [[virtue]].&lt;ref&gt;Plato. ''Apology'', 21d–e, 23a, 23e.&lt;/ref&gt;

One will sometimes find the claim that Socrates described himself as the "[[gadfly (social)|gadfly]]" of Athens which, like a sluggish horse, needed to be aroused by his "stinging".&lt;ref&gt;Plato. ''Apology'', 30e–31a.&lt;/ref&gt;  It should be pointed out, however, that in the Greek text of his defense given by Plato, Socrates never actually uses that term (viz., "gadfly" [Grk., ''[[:wiktionary:oestrus|oîstros]]''])&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/morph?l=oi%29%3Dstros&amp;la=greek&amp;can=oi%29%3Dstros0&amp;prior=oi)/stros#lexicon |title=Greek Word Study Tool |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; to describe himself.  Rather, his reference is merely allusive, as he (literally) says only that he has attached himself to the City (''proskeimenon tē polei'')&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Perseus:text:1999.04.0057:entry=pro/skeimai |title=Henry George Liddell, Robert Scott, A Greek-English Lexicon, πρόσκειμαι |publisher=Perseus.tufts.edu |date= |accessdate=2014-07-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; in order to sting it.&lt;ref&gt;See the Greek text in H. N. Fowler, trans., ''Plato'', vol. 1, ''“Euthyphro,” “Apology,” “Crito,” “Phaedo,” and “Phaedrus,”'' Loeb Classical Library (New York: G. P. Putnam’s Sons, 1919), pg. 112&lt;/ref&gt;  Nevertheless, he does make the bold claim that he is a god's gift to the Athenians.&lt;ref&gt;Plato. ''Apology'', 31a-b&lt;/ref&gt;

Socrates' [[elenctic]] method was often imitated by the young men of Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Plato. ''Apology'', 23c.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Association with Alcibiades and the Thirty Tyrants ===
[[Alcibiades]], an Athenian general who had been the main proponent of the disastrous [[Sicilian Expedition]] during the [[Peloponnesian Wars]], where virtually the entire Athenian invading force of more than 50,000 soldiers and non-combatants (e.g., the rowers of the [[Trireme]]s) was killed or captured and enslaved, was a student and close friend of Socrates, and his messmate during the siege of Potidaea (433–429 BC). Socrates remained Alcibiades' close friend, admirer, and mentor for about five or six years.&lt;ref name=Waterfield&gt;Waterfield, Robin. ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths''. New York: W.W. Norton and Company, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; While a masterful orator, Alcibiades has been described by at least two 20th century psychologists as exhibiting the classic features of [[psychopathy]]&lt;ref&gt;Anna C. Salter, ''Predators: Pedophiles, Rapists, And Other Sex Offenders'',Basic Books, 2005,pg. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Hervey M. Cleckley. The Mask of Sanity: An Attempt to Clarify Some Issues about the So-Called Psychopathic Personality. Martino Fine Books; 2 edition (February 18, 2015) (original ed. 1941)&lt;/ref&gt;. During his career, Alcibiades famously defected to Sparta, Athens' arch-enemy, after being summoned to trial, then to Persia after being caught in an affair with the wife of his benefactor (the King of Sparta). He then defected back to Athens after successfully persuading the Athenians that Persia would come to their aid against Sparta (though Persia had no intention of doing so). Finally driven out of Athens after the defeat of the [[Battle of Notium]] against Sparta, Alcibiades was assassinated in [[Phrygia]] in 404 BC by his Spartan enemies. 

Another possible source of resentment were the political views that he and his associates were thought to have embraced. [[Critias]], who appears in two of Plato's Socratic dialogues, was a leader of the [[Thirty Tyrants]] (the ruthless [[oligarchy|oligarchic]] regime that ruled Athens, as puppets of Sparta and backed by Spartan troops, for eight months in 404–403 BC until they were overthrown). Several of the Thirty had been students of Socrates, but there is also a record of their falling out.&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon. ''Memorabilia'', 1.2.29–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

As with many of the issues surrounding Socrates’ conviction, the nature of his affiliation with the Thirty Tyrants is far from straightforward. During the reign of the Thirty, many prominent Athenians who were opposed to the new government left Athens. Robin Waterfield asserts that “Socrates would have been welcome in oligarchic Thebes, where he had close associates among the [[Pythagoreans]] who flourished there, and which had already taken in other exiles.”&lt;ref name=Waterfield/&gt;{{Rp|183}} Given the availability of a hospitable host outside of Athens, Socrates, at least in a limited way, chose to remain in Athens. Thus, Waterfield suggests, Socrates’ contemporaries probably thought his remaining in Athens, even without participating in the Thirty’s bloodthirsty schemes, demonstrated his sympathy for the Thirty’s cause, not neutrality towards it. This is proved, Waterfield argues, by the fact that after the Thirty were no longer in power, anyone who had remained in Athens during their rule was encouraged to move to Eleusis, the new home of the expatriate Thirty.&lt;ref name=Waterfield/&gt; Socrates did oppose the will of the Thirty on one documented occasion. Plato’s ''Apology'' has the character of Socrates describe that the Thirty ordered him, along with four other men, to fetch a man named Leon from Salamis so that the Thirty could execute him. Socrates simply did not answer this order, nor had he Leon warned, while the other four men did go to Salamis to get Leon.&lt;ref&gt;Plato. ''Apology'', 32c.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Support for Oligarchic Rule and Contempt for Athenian Democracy ===

According to the portraits left by some of Socrates' followers, Socrates himself seems to have openly espoused certain anti-democratic views, most prominent perhaps being the view that it is not majority opinion that yields correct policy but rather genuine knowledge and professional competence, which is [[Technocracy|possessed by only a few]].&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, ''Memorabilia'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0208&amp;layout=&amp;loc=1.2.1 1.2.9]; Plato, ''Crito'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170&amp;layout=&amp;loc=Crito+47c 47c–d], ''Laches'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0176&amp;layout=&amp;loc=Lach.+184e 184e].&lt;/ref&gt;  Plato also portrays him as being severely critical of some of the most prominent and well-respected leaders of the Athenian democracy;&lt;ref&gt;''Gorgias'' 503c–d, 515d–517c.&lt;/ref&gt; and even has him claim that the officials selected by the Athenian system of governance cannot credibly be regarded as benefactors, since it is not any group of ''many'' that benefits, but only "some one person or very few".&lt;ref&gt;''Apology of Socrates'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170&amp;layout=&amp;loc=Apol.+25a 25a-b].&lt;/ref&gt;  Finally, Socrates was known as often praising the laws of the undemocratic regimes of [[Sparta]] and [[Crete]].&lt;ref&gt;Plato, ''Crito'' [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/cgi-bin/ptext?doc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0170&amp;layout=&amp;loc=Crito+52e 52e].&lt;/ref&gt; Plato himself reinforced anti-democratic ideas in ''[[Republic_(Plato)|The Republic]]'', advocating rule by elite, enlightened "Philosopher-Kings".

The totalitarian Thirty Tyrants had anointed themselves as the elite, and in the minds of his Athenian accusers, Socrates was guilty because he was suspected of introducing oligarchic ideas to them. [[Larry Gonick]], in his "[[Cartoon History of the Universe]]"&lt;ref&gt; Gonick, Larry. "Cartoon History of the Universe Vol 1-7". Volume 7 - All about Athens. Doubleday Books, 1990. {{ISBN|0385-26520-4}}.&lt;/ref&gt; writes, "''The trial of Socrates has always seemed mysterious...the charges sound vague and unreal...because behind the stated charges was Socrates's real crime: preaching a philosophy that produced Alcibiades and Critias... but of course he couldn't be prosecuted for that under the amnesty'' (which had been declared after the overthrow of the Thirty Tyrants)... ''so his accusers made it "not believing the Gods of the city, introducing new Gods, and corrupting the youth.''" 

Apart from his views on politics, Socrates held unusual views on religion. He made several references to his personal spirit, or ''[[Daemon (classical mythology)|daimonion]]'', although he explicitly claimed that it never urged him on, but only warned him against various prospective actions. {{Citation needed|date=November 2018}}

==Historical descriptions of the trial==
{{Wikisource|Euthyphro}}
{{Wikisource|Apology (Plato)}}
{{Wikisource|Crito}}
{{Wikisource|Phaedo}}

The extant, primary sources about the history of the trial and execution of Socrates are: the ''[[Apology (Xenophon)|Apology of Socrates to the Jury]]'', by Xenophon of Athens, a historian; and the [[tetralogy]] of Socratic dialogues — ''[[Euthyphro]]'', the ''[[Apology (Plato)|Socratic Apology]]'', ''[[Crito]]'', and ''[[Phaedo (Plato)|Phaedo]]'', by Plato, a philosopher who had been a student of [[Socrates]].

In ''The Indictment of Socrates'' (392 BC), the [[Sophism|sophist]] rhetorician [[Polycrates (sophist)|Polycrates]] (440–370) presents the prosecution speech, by [[Anytus]], which condemned Socrates for his political and religious activities in [[Classical Athens|Athens]] before the year 403 BC. In presenting such a prosecution, which addressed matters external to the charges of moral corruption and impiety, for which the Athenian ''[[polis]]'' were trying Socrates, Anytus violated the political [[amnesty]] granted in the agreement of reconciliation (403–402 BC)&lt;ref&gt;Waterfield, Robin. ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths''. New York, 2009. p. 196.&lt;/ref&gt; that granted amnesty to a man for political and religious actions taken before or during the rule of the [[Thirty Tyrants]], “under which all further charges and official recriminations concerning the [reign of] terror were forbidden”.&lt;ref&gt;Martin, Thomas R. ''Ancient Greece: From Prehistoric to Hellenistic Times''. Yale University, 2009. p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the legal and religious particulars against Socrates that Polycrates reported in ''The Indictment of Socrates'' are addressed in the replies by Xenophon and the sophist [[Libanius|Libanius of Antioch]] (314–390).

==Trial==
[[File:He drank the contents as though it were a draught of Wine.jpg|thumb|right|The Death of Socrates (399 BC): He drank the contents as though it were a draught of wine.]]

Formal accusation was the second element of the trial of Socrates, which the accuser, [[Meletus]], swore to be true, before the [[archon]] (a state officer with mostly religious duties) who considered the evidence and determined that there was an actionable case of “moral corruption of Athenian youth” and “[[impiety]]”, for which the philosopher must legally answer; the archon summoned Socrates for a trial by jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Filonik|first=Jakub|date=2013|title=Athenian Impiety Trials: A Reappraisal|url=https://dx.doi.org/10.13130/1128-8221/4290|journal=Dike|issue=16|doi=|pmid=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Athenian juries were drawn by lottery, from a group of hundreds of male-citizen volunteers; such a great jury usually ensured a majority verdict in a trial. Although neither [[Plato]] nor [[Xenophon of Athens]] identifies the number of jurors, a jury of 500 men likely was the legal norm. In the  ''[[Apology (Plato)|Apology of Socrates]]'' (36a–b), about Socrates’s defence at trial, Plato said that if just 30 of the votes had been otherwise, then Socrates would have been acquitted (36a), and that (perhaps) less than three-fifths of the jury voted against him (36b).&lt;ref&gt;The second point is tenable if Socrates’s claim (36a–b) entails that Meletus, Lycon, and Anytus each was responsible for one-third of the votes against Socrates, who implies that Meletus failed to persuade less than one-fifth of the judges. The jury of 500 or 501 men, based either on [[Diogenes Laertius]] (2.41) or on the Aristotelian ''[[Constitution of the Athenians (Aristotle)|Athenaion Politeia]]'' (68). See P. Rhodes, 1981, ''Commentary on the Aristotelian "Athenaion Politeia"'', p. 729.&lt;/ref&gt;

Having been found guilty of corruption and impiety, Socrates and the prosecutor suggested sentences for the punishment of his crimes against the city-state of Athens. Expressing surprise at the few votes required for an acquittal, Socrates joked that he be punished with free meals at the [[Prytaneum]] (the city’s sacred hearth), an honour usually held for a [[benefactor (law)|benefactor]] of Athens, and for the victorious athletes of an Olympiad. After that failed suggestion, Socrates then offered to pay a fine of 100 drachmae—one-fifth of his property—which largesse testified to his integrity and poverty as a philosopher. Finally, a fine of 3,000 drachmae was agreed, proposed by Plato, [[Crito of Alopece|Crito]], Critobulus, and Apollodorus, who guaranteed payment—nonetheless, the prosecutor of the trial of Socrates proposed the death penalty for the impious philosopher. (Diogenes Laertius, 2.42).

In the event, friends, followers, and students encouraged Socrates to flee Athens, action which the citizens expected; yet, on principle, Socrates refused to flout the law and escape his legal responsibility to Athens. (''[[Crito]]'') Therefore, faithful to his teaching of civic obedience to the law, the 70-year-old Socrates executed his death-sentence, and drank the hemlock, as condemned at trial. (See: ''[[Phaedo]]'')

==Interpretations of the trial of Socrates==
===Ancient===
In the time of the trial of Socrates, the year 399 BC, the city-state of [[Classical Athens|Athens]] recently had perdured the trials and tribulations of Spartan [[hegemony]], the thirteen-month régime of the [[Thirty Tyrants]], imposed consequent to the Athenian defeat in the [[Peloponnesian War]] (431–404 BC). At the request of the pro–Sparta [[Lysander]], a Spartan admiral, the Thirty men, led by [[Critias]] and [[Theramenes]], were installed to govern Athens, and to revise the city’s democratic laws, which were inscribed to a wall of the [[Stoa Basileios]]; their political actions meant to facilitate the subordination of Athenian government—from [[democracy]] to [[oligarchy]]—in service to [[Sparta]].&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, [[Hellenica (Xenophon)|''Hellenica'']], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Xen.+Hell.+2.3.15&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0206 2.3.15–16]&lt;/ref&gt;

Moreover, the Thirty Tyrants also appointed a council of 500 men to perform the judicial functions that once had belonged to every Athenian citizen.&lt;ref name=AC35.1&gt;[http://classics.mit.edu/Aristotle/athenian_const.html Aristotle, ''Athenian Constitution'', 35.1 (350 BC).]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Krentz, Peter. ''The Thirty at Athens'' p. 50. ({{ISBN|0801414504}})&lt;/ref&gt; In their brief régime, the Spartan oligarchs killed about five per cent of the Athenian population, confiscated much property, and exiled [[Athenian democracy|democrats]] from the city proper; and the fact that Critias, leader of the Thirty Tyrants, had been a pupil of Socrates was held against him, as a citizen of Athens.&lt;ref&gt;Wolpert, Andrew. ''Remembering Defeat: Civil War and Civic Memory in Ancient Athens''. ({{ISBN|0-8018-6790-8}}).&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, [[Hellenica (Xenophon)|''Hellenica'']], [http://www.perseus.tufts.edu/hopper/text?doc=Xen.+Hell.+2.3.15&amp;fromdoc=Perseus%3Atext%3A1999.01.0206 2.3.15–16]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Contemporary===
Plato’s presentation of the trial and death of Socrates inspired the writers, artists, and philosophers to revisit the matter; for some, the execution of the man whom Plato called “the wisest and most just of all men” demonstrated the defects of [[democracy]] and of popular rule; for others, the Athenian actions were a justifiable defense of the recently re-established democracy.&lt;ref&gt;I.F. Stone. ''The Trial of Socrates'', 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''The Trial of Socrates'' (1988), [[I. F. Stone]] said that Socrates wanted to be sentenced to death, in order to justify his philosophic opposition to the Athenian democracy of that time, and because, as a man, he saw that old age would be an unpleasant time for him.

In the play ''[[Socrates on Trial (play)|Socrates on Trial]]'' (2007), Andrew Irvine said that for loyalty to Athenian democracy, Socrates willingly accepted the guilty-verdict voted by the jurors of his trial. “During a time of war, and great social and intellectual upheaval, Socrates felt compelled to express his views, openly, regardless of the consequences. As a result, he is remembered today, not only for his sharp wit and high ethical standards, but also for his loyalty to the view that, in a democracy, the best way for a man to serve himself, his friends, and his city—even during times of war—is by being loyal to, and by speaking publicly about, the truth.”&lt;ref&gt;Irvine, Andrew D.  Introduction, ''Socrates on Trial'', Toronto: University of Toronto Press, 2008, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''Why Socrates Died: Dispelling the Myths'' (2009), [[Robin Waterfield]] said that the death of Socrates was an act of volition motivated by a greater purpose; Socrates “saw himself as healing the City’s ills by his voluntary death”.&lt;ref name=Waterfield/&gt;{{Rp|204}} That Socrates, with his unconventional methods of [[Intellectualism|intellectual]] enquiry, attempted to resolve the political confusion then occurring in the city-state of Athens, by willingly being the scapegoat, whose death would quiet old disputes, which then would allow progress towards political harmony and social peace for the Athenian polis.&lt;ref name=Waterfield/&gt;

In ''The New Trial of Socrates'' (2012), an international panel of ten judges held a [[Mock trial|mock re-trial]] of Socrates to resolve the matter of the charges levelled against him by [[Meletus]], [[Anytus]], and [[Apology (Plato)|Lycon]], that: “Socrates is a doer of evil, and corrupter of the youth, and he does not believe in the gods of the state, and he believes in other new divinities of his own”; by split decision, five judges voted “Guilty” and five judges voted “Not guilty”, which acquitted Socrates of corruption of the young and of impiety against the Athenian pantheon. Limiting themselves to the facts of the case against Socrates, the judges did not consider any sentence; the judges who voted the philosopher guilty said that they would not have considered the death penalty for Socrates.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Socrates acquitted in ancient trial re-run |url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gZNTTgYc0VcusOWcootqMJvuhAqw |publisher=Google/AFP |date=25 May 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140130161519/https://www.google.com/hostednews/afp/article/ALeqM5gZNTTgYc0VcusOWcootqMJvuhAqw |archivedate=January 30, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sgt.gr/en/programme/event/688 The New Trial of Socrates.] Onassis Cultural Centre&lt;/ref&gt;

The book chronicles Popper's life from the beginning, including wider implications he drew from his experiences. In chapter 1, "Omniscience and Fallibility,"  for example, he describes his apprenticeship to a cabinetmaker while he was a university student. His master invited him to ask anything he liked, because, with due modesty, the master claimed to know everything. From his omniscient master, Popper writes that he became a disciple of [[Socrates]] and learned more about the [[theory of knowledge]], including how little he knew, than from his university teachers.&lt;ref&gt;Karl Popper (1976 [2002]).

Other thematic chapter subjects include music, education, philosophical problems Popper encountered, and his differences from other philosophers, whether earlier or contemporary.  These are woven into an account of events in his life and [[research programme]]s that he developed.&lt;ref&gt;Karl R. Popper ([1976] 2002). ''Unended Quest: An Intellectual Autobiography''.

'''Victor Howard ("Vic") Dudman''' (1935–2009) was an Australian [[logician]] based at [[Macquarie University]].

He was greatly influenced by [[Willard Van Orman Quine]] on whose work he based his undergraduate logic courses.

He is particularly noted for his views on the interpretation of the [[material conditional]]. [[David Kellogg Lewis|David Lewis]], a frequent visitor to Australian departments of logic, once noted "If Dudman's view is correct, and I cannot at the moment see what is wrong with it, then almost everything I have written on conditionals is mistaken".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ball0888/manifesto/if.htm#intro |title=Archived copy |accessdate=11 January 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110604164606/http://users.ox.ac.uk/~ball0888/manifesto/if.htm |archivedate=4 June 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jean Curthoys]] saw through the press and wrote an introduction to ''[http://www.palgrave.com/products/title.aspx?pid=581817 Victor Dudman's Grammar and Semantics]'' (Palgrave Macmillan, 2012).

The '''''Śūraṅgama Sūtra''''' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/surangama.pdf|title=Surgangama Sutra|author=Translated by Upasaka LuK'uan Yu (Charles Luk)}}&lt;/ref&gt;([[Sanskrit]]: शूरङ्गम सूत्र; {{CJKV|first=t|t=大佛頂首楞嚴經}}) (Taisho 945) is a [[Mahayana|Mahayana Buddhist]] [[sutra]] that has been especially influential in [[Chan Buddhism]]. The general doctrinal outlook of the ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'' is that of [[esotericism|esoteric]] Buddhism and [[Buddha-nature]], with some influence from [[Yogacara]]. There have been questions regarding the translation of this sutra as it was not sponsored by the Imperial Chinese Court and as such the records regarding its translation in the early eighth century were not carefully preserved (see [[#History|History]]); however, it has never been classified as [[apocrypha]] in any Chinese-language Tripitakas including the Taisho Tripitaka where it is placed in the Esoteric Sutra category (密教部).&lt;ref&gt;Taisho 945 is found in Volume 19 of the Taisho Tripitaka.{{cite web |url=http://tripitaka.cbeta.org/mobile/index.php?index=T |website=CBETA 漢文大藏經 |script-title=大正新脩大藏經 |title=Taishō Shinshū Daizōkyō |language=Chinese |trans-title=Taishō Shinshū Tripitaka |quote=This is an index to the Taisho Tripitaka - nb Volume 19 is listed as 密教部 or Esoteric Sutra Section is where Taisho 945 (Surangama Sutra) is located.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The sutra was translated into Tibetan during the late eighth to early ninth century and a complete translation exists in Tibetan, Mongolian and the Manchu languages (see [[#Translations|Translations]]). Current consensus is that the text is a compilation of Indic materials with extensive editing in China, rather than a translation of a single text from Sanskrit. Recently (pre-2010), a Sanskrit language palm leaf manuscript consisting of 226 leaves with 6 leaves missing was discovered in a temple in China; if verified, the perennial questions regarding the authenticity of the Śūraṅgama Sūtra can be put to rest.&lt;ref name="李学竹"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://wenku.baidu.com/view/510144bef111f18582d05a44.html |trans-title=China Tibetan Studies - The State of Sanskrit Language Palm Leaf Manuscripts in China |script-title=zh:中国藏学-中国梵文贝叶概况 |title=Zhōng guó zàng xué - Zhōng guó fàn wén bèi yè gài kuàng |language=Chinese |date=2010 |access-date=2017-12-06 |authors=Li Xuezhu (李学竹) |website=Baidu 文库 |series=Vol. 1 No. 90 |quote=‘河南南阳菩提寺原藏有1函梵文贝叶经，共226叶，其中残缺6叶，函上写有“印度古梵文”字样，据介绍，内容为 《楞严经》，很可能是唐代梵文经的孤本，字体为圆形，系印度南方文字一种，被国家定为一级文物，现存彭雪枫纪念馆。’(tr to English: Henan Nanyang Bodhi Temple originally had one Sanskrit language manuscript sutra, consisting in total 226 leaves, of which 6 were missing... according to introduction, it contains the Śūraṅgama Sūtra and most probably the only extant Sanskrit manuscript dating from the Tang Dynasty.

==Title==
The complete title preserved in {{zh|大佛頂如來密因修證了義諸菩薩萬行首楞嚴經}}, meaning:
{{quote|The Sūtra on the {{IAST|Śūraṅgama}} Mantra that is spoken from above the Crown of the Great Buddha's Head and on the Hidden Basis of the Tathagata's Myriad Bodhisattva Practices that lead to their Verifications of Ultimate Truth.&lt;ref&gt;Śūraṅgama Sūtra Translation Committee of the Buddhist Text Translation Society, 2009, p. xxv.&lt;/ref&gt;}}
An alternate translation of the title reads:
{{quote|The Sutra of the Foremost Shurangama at the Great Buddha’s Summit Concerning the Tathagata's Secret Cause of Cultivation His Certification to the Complete Meaning and Bodhisattvas' Myriad Practices&lt;ref&gt;The Shurangama Sutra with commentary by the Venerable Master Hsuan Hua - New Edition {{ISBN|0881399493}}. http://cttbusa.org/shurangama1/shurangama1.asp&lt;/ref&gt;}}

An original Sanskrit version of ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'' is not known to be extant, and thus its full Sanskrit name is not known.
''{{IAST|Śūraṅgama}}'' roughly means "indestructible." The word is composed of ''Śūraṅ'' (great, absolutely), with ''Gama'' (durable, solid).{{sfn|Buddhist Text Translation Society|2009|p=xiii}}

==The name of the ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'' in different languages==
A common translation of the sutra's name in English is the "Heroic March sutra" (as used e.g. by Matthew Kapstein, Norman Waddell, and Andy Ferguson), or the "scripture of the Heroic Progress" (as used e.g. by Thomas Cleary).

The full title of the sutra is appears as: {{cjkv|t=大佛頂如來密因修證了義諸菩薩萬行首楞嚴經|p=Dà Fódǐng Rúlái Mìyīn Xiūzhèng Liǎoyì Zhū Púsà Wànxíng Shǒuléngyán jīng|k=대불정여래밀인수증료의제보살만행수릉엄경|v=Đại Phật đỉnh Như Lai mật nhân tu chứng liễu nghĩa chư Bồ Tát vạn hạnh thủ-lăng-nghiêm kinh}}.

It is also known by abbreviated versions of the title such as {{cjkv|p=Dà Fódǐng Shǒuléngyán jīng|k=대불정수릉엄경|t=大佛頂首楞嚴經|v=Đại Phật đỉnh thủ-lăng-nghiêm kinh}} or simply and more commonly {{cjkv|p=Léngyán jīng|t=楞嚴經|v=lăng-nghiêm kinh|k=릉엄경}}.

==History==

===Authorship===
The first catalogue that recorded the ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'' was Ven. Master Zhisheng ({{zh|智昇}}), a monk in [[Tang dynasty|Tang China]]. Zhisheng said this book was brought back from [[Guangxi]] to [[Luoyang]] during the reign of Emperor [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang|Xuanzong]]. He gave two different accounts in two different books, both of which were published in 730 CE.

# According to the first account found in ''The Kaiyuan Era Catalog of the Buddhist Tripitaka'' ({{zh|開元釋教錄}}) the {{IAST|Śūraṅgama Sūtra}} was translated in 713 CE by a Ven. Master Huai Di ({{zh|懷迪}}) and an unnamed Indian monk.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|''The Kaiyuan Era Catalog of the Buddhist Tripitaka'' said, "Venerable Huai Di (Chinese: 懷迪), a native of Xún zhōu (循州) [located in parts of today's [[Guangdong]] Province], lived in Nanlou Monastery (南樓寺) on Mount Luofu (羅浮山). [[Mount Luofu]] is where many ṛsi lived and visited. Ven. Huai Di studied Buddhist sutras and sastras for a long time, and achieved profound erudition. He was also proficient in a wide range of knowledge. Here close to the coast, there are many Indian monks who come here. Ven. Huai Di learned how to say and read their language with them. When [[Mahāratnakūṭa Sūtra]] was translated to Chinese,  Bodhiruci invited Huai Di to verify the translation. After the translation was finished, he returned to his hometown. Once he came to [[Guangzhou]], he met a monk, whose name was unrecorded, from India with a Sanskrit book. He asked Huai Di to translate this book, a total of ten volumes, which was ''Shurangama Sutra''. Ven. Huai Di wrote this book and modified the wording. After the book was translated, the monk left, and no one knows where he went. An official went to southern China, bringing this book back, so it became known here."{{refn|group=upper-roman|《開元釋教錄》：「沙門釋懷迪，循州人也，住本州羅浮山南樓寺。其山乃仙聖遊居之處。迪久習經論，多所該博，九流七略，粗亦討尋，但以居近海隅，數有梵僧遊止；迪就學書語，復皆通悉。往者三藏菩提流志譯寶積經，遠召迪來，以充證義。所為事畢，還歸故鄉。後因遊廣府遇一梵僧 (未得其名) ， 齎梵經一夾，請共譯之，勒成十卷，即《大佛頂萬行首楞嚴經》是也。迪筆受經旨，緝綴文理。其梵僧傳經事畢，莫知所之。有因南使，流經至此。」}}}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|In 706 CE, [[Mahāratnakūṭa Sūtra]] began translation. HuaiDi was invited to [[Luoyang]]. The translation was finished in 713 CE. HuaiDi then went back to his hometown. The Shurangama Sutra was translated after 713 CE. }}
# According to the second account, in his later book ''Continuation to the History of the Translation of Buddhist Sutras Mural Record'' (續古今譯經圖記), the ''{{IAST|Śūraṅgama Sūtra}}'' was translated in May 705 CE by [[shramana|Śramaṇa]] Pāramiti from central [[India]], who came to China and brought the text to the province of [[Guangzhou]]. The text was then polished and edited by Empress [[Wu Zetian]]'s former minister, court regulator, and state censor [[Fang Yong]] ({{zh|房融}}) of Qingho.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|The mention of Fang Yong poses a chronological problem. According to the [[Old Book of Tang]] [[Fang Yong]] was put in prison in January 705 CE because he was involved in a court struggle. He was then exiled from [[Luoyang]] to [[Guangxi]] [[Qinzhou]] in February, where he died.{{refn|group=upper-roman|《舊唐書》卷七中宗紀云：「神龍元年正月…鳳閣侍郎韋承慶，正諫大夫房融，司禮卿韋慶等下獄……二月甲寅…韋承慶貶高要尉，房融配欽州。」《新唐書》〈中宗紀〉：「神龍元年二月甲寅......貶韋承慶為高要尉，流房融於高州。」新唐書卷139房琯傳：「父融，武后時以正諫大夫同鳳閣台平章事。神龍元年貶死高州。」《通鑑》卷208神龍元年：「二月乙卯正諫大夫同平章事房融除名流高州。」}} If the book was translated at 705 CE, the cooperation of Fang Yong might be doubtful. If the text was translated in 713 CE, [[Fang Yong]] had no chance to aid in the translation of the text, since he died in 705}} The translation was reviewed by Śramaṇa Meghaśikha from [[Oddiyana|Oḍḍiyāna]], and certified by Śramaṇa Huai-di ({{zh|懷迪}}) of Nanlou Monastery (南樓寺) on [[Mount Luofu]] (羅浮山).{{refn|group=lower-alpha| The ''Continuation to the History of the Translation of Buddhist Sutras Mural Record'' said, "[[shramana|Śramaṇa]] Pāramiti, which is means Quantum, came from Central India. He travel, missionary, arrived china. He stayed at [[Guangxiao Temple (Guangxi)|Guangxiao Temple]] in [[Guangxi]]. Because he was very knowledgeable, so many people came to visit him. To help people, so he determined not to keep secret. in May 23 705 CE, He recited a Tantras, which is ''The Sūtra on the Śūraṅgama Mantra Spoken from Above the Crown of the Great Buddha's Head, and on the Hidden Basis of the Tathagata's Myriad Bodhisattva Practices Leading to Their Verification of the Ultimate Truth''. Śramaṇa Meghaśikha from [[Oddiyana|Oḍḍiyāna]] translated it to Chinese. [[Fang Yong]]({{zh|房融}}) of Qingho, the former minister, court regulator, and state censor, wrote it down. Śramaṇa Huai-di ({{zh|懷迪}}) of Nanlou Monastery (南樓寺) on [[Mount Luofu]] (羅浮山) verify it. After teach it all, he came back to his country. An official went to southern China, bringing this book back, so we see it here.

Zhi-sheng didn't explain why he wrote two different accounts, but at the end of ''Continuation to the History of the Translation of Buddhist Sutras Mural Record'' (續古今譯經圖記) he left a small comment, recommending to readers that the account at ''The Kaiyuan Era Catalog of the Buddhist Tripitaka'' is more reliable than the ''Continuation to the History of the Translation of Buddhist Sutras Mural Record''  (續古今譯經圖記).{{refn|group=lower-alpha|''Continuation to the History of the Translation of Buddhist Sutras Mural Record'' said, "These records is edited from the old data, but some errors have not been modified yet.

Dispute about this text arose in 8th century in Japan, so [[Emperor Kōnin]] sent Master Tokusei ({{CJKV|p=Deqing |j=徳清}}) and a group of monks to China, asking whether this book was a forgery or not. A Chinese [[upasaka]] or layperson told the head monk of the Japanese monastic delegation, Master Tokusei that this was forged by [[Fang Yong]]. {{refn|group=lower-alpha|''in-depth meaning of Three Treatise school'' said, "([[Emperor Kōnin]]) sent Master Tokusei ({{CJKV|p=Deqing |j=徳清}}) and other monks to Tang China to find the answer.

The [[Qianlong]] Emperor and the Third [[Changkya Khutukhtu]], the traditional head tulku of the Gelug lineage of Tibetan/Vajrayana Buddhism in Inner Mongolia,  believed in the authenticity of the Śūraṅgama Sūtra.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.doc88.com/p-9082646180913.html |trans-title=Journal of Inner Mongolia University (Philosophy and Social Sciences)- The Qianlong Emperor's "Foreword to The Royal Translation and Compilation of the Śūraṅgama Sūtra" : Research and Comparison of the Manchu Language and Chinese Text |script-title=zh:内蒙古大学学报(哲学社会科学版）-乾隆皇帝《御制楞严经序》满、汉文本对勘及研究 |title=Qián lóng huáng dì 《 yù zhì léng yán jīng xù 》 mǎn、hàn wén běn duì kān jí yán jiū |language=Chinese |date=March 2014 |access-date=2017-12-06 |authors=Chai Bing (柴冰) |website=DOC88.COM |series=Vol. 46 No. 2 |quote=然而在乾隆皇帝另一御制序文里也提及了《首楞严经》...于乾隆三十五年（1770）7月25日的藏文《甘珠尔》的文序。...因为汉文本《首楞严经》中包含的经咒，与同一经咒的印度文献完全相同。有印度梵本渊源，因而整部《首楞严经》是真的。...至少可以看出乾隆及三世章嘉的态度即判定《首楞严经》并非伪经。(trans. to English: however in another foreword written by the Qianlong Emperor the Śūraṅgama Sūtra is mentioned...In the foreword to the Tibetan Kangyur from July 25, 1770...because the mantra contained in the Chinese text of the Śūraṅgama Sūtra is identical to the mantra in an Indian text.

In China during the early modern era, the reformist [[Liang Qichao]] claimed that the sutra is apocryphal, writing, "The real Buddhist scriptures would not say things like Surangama Sutra, so we know the Surangama Sutra is apocryphal.{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Liang Qichao, ''the authenticity of Ancient books and their year'', "The real Buddhist scriptures would not say things like Śūraṅgama Sūtra, so we know the Śūraṅgama Sūtra is a Apocrypha."{{refn|group=upper-roman|梁啟超《古書真偽及其年代》：「真正的佛經並没有《楞嚴經》一類的話，可知《楞嚴經》一書是假書。」}}{{Citation needed|date=May 2012}}}} In the same era, [[Lü Cheng]] ({{zh|呂澂}}) wrote an essay to claim that the book is apocryphal, named "One hundred reasons about why Shurangama Sutra is apocryphal" ({{zh|楞嚴百偽}}).
	 
Hurvitz claims that the ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'' is "a Chinese forgery" but gives no reasons for this claim.{{sfn|Hurvitz|1967|p=482}} Faure claims that it is "apocryphal," similarly without rationale.{{sfn|Faure|1991|p=42, 122 n9, 231, 240}}

Ron Epstein gives an overview of the arguments for Indian or Chinese origin, and concludes:{{sfn|Epstein|1976}}

{{quote|Preliminary analysis of the internal evidence then indicates that the Sutra is probably a compilation of Indic materials that may have had a long literary history. It should be noted though, that for a compilation, which is also how the Sutra is treated by some traditional commentators, the Sutra has an intricate beauty of structure that is not particularly Chinese and which shines through and can clearly be distinguished from the Classical Chinese syntax, on which attention has usually been centered. Thus one of the difficulties with the theory that the Sutra is apocryphal is that it would be difficult to find an author who could plausibly be held accountable for both structure and language and who would also be familiar with the doctrinal intricacies that the Sutra presents. Therefore, it seems likely that the origin of the great bulk of material in the Sutra is Indic, though it is obvious that the text was edited in China. However, a great deal of further, systematic research will be necessary to bring to light  all the details of the text's rather complicated construction.}}

A number of scholars have associated the ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'' with the Buddhist tradition at [[Nalanda|Nālandā]].{{sfn|Humphreys1995|p=111}}{{sfn|Dutt|1962|p=264}} Epstein also notes that the general doctrinal position of the sūtra does indeed correspond to what is known about the Buddhist teachings at Nālandā during this period.{{sfn|Epstein|1976}}

== Teachings ==
[[File:Astasahasrika Prajnaparamita Mara Demons.jpeg|thumb|The influence of [[mara (demon)|Māra]] is a major theme of the ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'']]

=== Doctrinal orientation ===
The ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'' contains teachings from [[Yogacara|Yogācāra]], [[Buddha-nature]], and [[Vajrayana]].{{sfn|Epstein|1976}}{{sfn|Buddhist Text Translation Society|2009|p=xxx-xxxii}} It makes use of [[Buddhist logic]] with its methods of [[syllogism]] and the [[catuṣkoṭi]] "fourfold negation" first popularized by [[Nagarjuna|Nāgārjuna]].{{sfn|Buddhist Text Translation Society|2009|p=xxxii-xxxiv}}

=== Main themes ===
Some of the main themes of the ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'' are the worthlessness of the [[Dharma]] when unaccompanied by [[samadhi|samādhi]] power, and the importance of moral precepts as a foundation for the Buddhist practice. Also stressed is the theme of how one effectively combats delusions that may arise during meditation.{{sfn|Epstein|1976}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|D.T. Suzuki gives a detailed overview of the contents of the sutra in ''Manual of Zen Buddhism''.{{sfn|Suzuki|2001}}}}

Ron Epstein and David Rounds have suggested that the major themes of the ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'' reflect the strains upon Indian Buddhism during the time of its creation.{{sfn|Buddhist Text Translation Society|2009|p=xxxiii-xxxix}} They cite the resurgence of tribal influences, and the crumbling social supports for monastic Buddhist institutions. This era also saw the emergence of Hindu tantrism and the beginnings of Esoteric Buddhism and the [[siddha]] traditions.{{sfn|Buddhist Text Translation Society|2009|p=xxxiii-xxxix}} They propose that moral challenges and general confusion about Buddhism are said to have then given rise to the themes of the ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'', such as clear understanding of principles, moral discipline, essential Buddhist cosmology, development of samādhi, and how to avoid falling into various delusions in meditation.

=== Two types of mind ===
David Rounds notes that the Buddha makes a very important distinction when teaching his cousin, Ananda, about his mind that there are in fact not one, but two different types of mind (that are fundamentally different in their natures) that we need to be aware of in our spiritual cultivation:&lt;ref&gt;David Rounds.  Rescuing Ananda - An overview of the Surangama Sutra.  Religion East &amp; West, Issue 7, October, 2007. p81.  https://issuu.com/drbu/docs/issue7_art7&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|"The Buddha then compounds his cousin's confusion by stating that there are fundamentally two kinds of mind:

1.  First, the ordinary quotidian mind of which we are aware and which is entangled, lifetime after lifetime, in the snare of illusory perceptions and random thoughts;

2.  And second, the everlasting true mind, which is our real nature, and which is the state of the Buddha."

Ananda, what are the two fundamentals?

The first is the mind that is the basis of death and rebirth and that has continued for the entirety of time, which has no beginning.  This mind is dependent upon perceived objects, and it is this that you and all beings make use of and that each of you consider to be your own nature.

The second fundamental is enlightenment, which has no beginning; it is the original and pure essence of nirvana.  It is the original understanding, the real nature of consciousness.  All conditioned phenomena arise from it, and yet it is among those phenomena that beings lose track of it.  They have lost track of this fundamental understanding, though it is active in them all day long, and because they remain unaware of it, they make the mistake of entering the various destinies.}}

=== Tathagatagarbha ===

Rounds and Epstein explain the Buddha Nature, the Matrix of the Thus Come One as spoken of in the Surangama Sutra:&lt;ref&gt;A New Translation Buddhist Text Translation Society. The Śūraṅgama Sūtra With Excerpts from the Commentary by the Venerable Master Hsüan Hua (Kindle Locations 243-249).&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Fundamentally, everything that comes and goes, that comes into being and ceases to be, is within the true nature of the Matrix of the Thus-Come One, which is the wondrous, everlasting understanding — the unmoving, all-pervading, wondrous suchness of reality.}}

{{quote|[The Buddha] shows one by one that each of the elements of the physical world and each of the elements of our sensory apparatus is, fundamentally, an illusion. But at the same time, these illusory entities and experiences arise out of what is real. That matrix from which all is produced is the Matrix of the Thus-Come One. It is identical to our own true mind and identical as well to the fundamental nature of the universe and to the mind of all Buddhas.}}

=== Śūraṅgama Samādhi ===
The ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'' teaches about the Śūraṅgama Samādhi, which is associated with [[Enlightenment in Buddhism|complete enlightenment]] and [[Buddhahood]]. This samādhi is also featured extensively in the ''Śūraṅgama Samādhi Sūtra'', another Mahāyāna text. It is equally praised in the ''[[Mahāyāna Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra|Mahāparinirvāṇa Sūtra]]'', where it is explained by the Buddha that this samādhi is the essence of the nature of the Buddha and is indeed the "mother of all Buddhas."{{sfn|Lamotte|1998|p=36}} The Buddha also comments that the Śūraṅgama Samādhi additionally goes under several other names, specifically ''[[Prajnaparamita|Prajñāpāramitā]]'' ("Perfection of Wisdom"), the ''Vajra Samādhi'' ("Diamond Samadhi"), the ''Siṃhanāda Samādhi'' ("Lion's Roar Samādhi"), and the ''Buddhasvabhava'' ("[[Buddha-nature]]").{{sfn|Lamotte|1998|p=36}}

=== White Parasol Crown Dhāraṇī ===
In addition to the sūtra's contents, the [[dhāraṇī]] contained in it is known in Chinese as the ''Léngyán Zhòu'' (楞嚴咒), or [[Shurangama Mantra|Śūraṅgama Mantra]]. It is well-known and popularly chanted in East Asian Buddhism. In Sanskrit, the dhāraṇī is known as the "Sitātapatra Uṣṇīṣa Dhāraṇī" (Ch. 大白傘蓋陀羅尼). This is sometimes simplified in English to "White Canopy Dhāraṇī" or "White Parasol Dhāraṇī." In Tibetan traditions, the English is instead sometimes rendered as the "White Umbrella Mantra." The dhāraṇī is extant in three other translations found in the [[Chinese Buddhist canon]] {{refn|group=lower-alpha|[[Taisho Tripitaka|Taishō Tripiṭaka]] 944, 976, and 977}}, and is also preserved in Sanskrit and [[Standard Tibetan|Tibetan]].

According to Venerable [[Hsuan Hua]], the dhāraṇī contains five major divisions, which "control the vast demon armies of the five directions":{{sfn|Hua|1975}}
* In the East is the Vajra Division, hosted by [[Akshobhya|Akṣobhya]]
* In the South, the Jewel-creating Division, hosted by [[Ratnasambhava|Ratnasaṃbhava]]
* In the center, the Buddha Division, hosted by [[Vairocana]]
* In the West, the Lotus Division, hosted by [[Amitābha]]
* In the North, the Karma Division, hosted by [[Amoghasiddhi]]

===Fifty skandha-māras===
[[Māras]] as manifestations of the five [[skandha]]s are described in the ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.buddhanet.net/pdf_file/surangama.pdf|title=Surgangama Sutra|author=Translated by Upasaka LuK'uan Yu (Charles Luk)}}&lt;/ref&gt; In its section on the fifty skandha-māras, each of the five skandhas has ten skandha-māras associated with it, and each skandha-māra is described in detail as a deviation from correct samādhi. These skandha-māras are also known as the "fifty skandha demons" in some English-language publications. Epstein introduces the fifty skandha-māras section as follows:&lt;ref name="epstein50"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://online.sfsu.edu/repstein/Buddhism/Shurangama/ss8foreword.html|title=Fifty Skandha Demon States: Foreword|author=Ron Epstein}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|For each state a description is given of the mental phenomena experienced by the practitioner, the causes of the phenomena and the difficulties which arise from attachment to the phenomena and misinterpretation of them. In essence what is presented is both a unique method of cataloguing and classifying [[spiritual experience]] and indication of causal factors involved in the experience of the phenomena. Although the fifty states presented are by no means exhaustive, the approach taken has the potential of offering a framework for the classification of all spiritual experience, both Buddhist and non-Buddhist.}}

* One Must Cut Off Lust
* One Must Cut Off Killing
* One Must Cut Off Stealing
* One Must Cut Off False Speech
* One Must Cut Off Drinking

These precepts are the basis to samadhi which in turn reveals wisdom.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=The Canonical Book on the Buddha's Lengthy Discourses Volume II |translator-last=Ichimura 市村 |translator-first=Shōhei 承秉 |date=2016 |publisher=BDK America Inc. |series=Taisho No. 1 |chapter=Sutra 12 Doctrines in Groups of Three |page=19 |quote="Again, a sevenfold doctrine leads to an evil life course, a second sevenfold doctrine leads to a good life course, and a third sevenfold doctrine leads to nirvana.  What are the sevenfold doctrinal items that lead to an evil life course?  They are seven evil actions: taking life; taking what is not given;sexual misconduct; false speech; duplicitous speech; harsh speech; and frivolous sycophancy.  There are seven good actions: abstinence from taking life; abstinence from taking what is not given; abstinence from sexual misconduct; abstinence from false speech; abstinence from duplicitous speech; abstinence from harsh speech; and abstinence from frivolous sycophancy. What are the seven doctrinal items that lead to nirvana?  They are seven auxiliary disciplines of enlightenment.  First a bhikṣu practices the discipline of mindfulness on the basis of nondesire and quiescence, distancing [himself] from worldly matters...." Ven. Ichimura Shōhei translated the Chinese translation of the Sanskrit Dīrgha Āgama into English (the Theravada equivalent is the Dīrgha Nikāya in Pali). The original Sanskrit text is from the Dharmaguptaka School of Buddhism and was translated into Chinese by Buddhayaśas (a Kashmiri monk) and Zhu Fonian in 413 CE.  Notice the similar emphasis on precepts for the advancement of Buddhist practice.  Although this example is from the Dharmaguptaka school, the same emphasis on precepts can be applied to all schools of Buddhism.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Also compare the above admonishments with the Pārājika Pāḷi.{{cite web |url=https://www.budsas.org/ebud/ebsut019.htm |title=Vinaya The Four Disrobing Offences |authors=Ajahn Brahmavamso |website=BuddhaSasana |access-date=2018-07-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Buddha describes these four rules as clear and unalterable instruction on purity which transverse time and place. The same instructions were also transmitted from former Buddhas.

Even though one may have some wisdom and the manifestation of Chan samadhi, one is certain to enter the path of demons, spirits and deviants if he does not cease lust, killing and stealing respectively. Such people will revolve in the three paths and are bound to sink into the bitter sea of birth and death when their retribution ends.

If people make false claims to be Buddha or certified sages, such people will lose proper knowledge and vision, and later fall into sufferings of hells.

===China===
The ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'' has been widely studied and commented on in China. Ron Epstein...
{{quote|... found reference to 127 Chinese commentaries on the Sutra, quite a few for such a lengthy work, including 59 in the Ming dynasty alone, when it was especially popular ".{{sfn|Epstein|1976}}}}

The ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'' is one of the seminal texts of [[Zen|Chán Buddhism]]. It was first transmitted by [[Yuquan Shenxiu]],{{sfn|Faure|1991|p=231, note 3}} the original sixth patriarch and the seminal figure of the Northern school. It "is connected with the enlightenment of"{{sfn|Epstein|1976}} [[Changshui Zixuan]] from the [[Song dynasty]] and [[Hanshan Deqing]] (憨山德清) from the [[Ming dynasty|Ming]].

The ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'' is being cited in case 94 of the ''[[Blue Cliff Record]]'':
{{quote|In the ''Surangama Sutra'' the Buddha says, "When unseeing, why do you not see the unseeing? If you see the unseeing, it is no longer unseeing. If you do not see the unseeing, it is not an object. Why isn't it yourself?"{{sfn|Sekida|1996|p=387}}{{refn|group=lower-alpha|This reminds of Nagarjuna's ''Sunyatasaptati'':&lt;br /&gt;
[51] The sense of sight is not inside the eye, not inside form, and not in between. [Therefore] an image depending upon form and eye is false.&lt;br /&gt;
[52] If the eye does not see itself, how can it see form? Therefore eye and form are without self. The same [is true for the] remaining sense-fields.&lt;br /&gt;
[53] Eye is empty of its own self [and] of another's self. Form is also empty. Likewise [for the] remaining sense-fields.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.fodian.net/english/Nagarjuna%20-%20Sunyatasaptati.htm Nagarjuna's Sunyatasaptati]&lt;/ref&gt;}}}}

Dōgen commented on the verse "When someone gives rise to Truth by returning to the Source, the whole of space in all ten quarters falls away and vanishes":

{{quote|This verse has been cited by various Buddhas and Ancestors alike. Up to this very day, this verse is truly the Bones and Marrow of the Buddhas and Ancestors. It is the very Eye of the Buddhas and Ancestors. As to my intention in saying so, there are those who say that the ten-fascicle Shurangama Scripture is a spurious scripture, whereas others say that it is a genuine Scripture: both views have persisted from long in the past down to our very day [...] Even were the Scripture a spurious one, if [Ancestors] continue to offer its turning, then it is a genuine Scripture of the Buddhas and Ancestors, as well as the Dharma Wheel intimately associated with Them.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thezensite.com/ZenTeachings/Dogen_Teachings/Shobogenzo/071temborin.pdf Dōgen: ''On Turning The Wheel'']&lt;/ref&gt;}}
The contemporary Chán-master Venerable [[Hsu Yun]] wrote a commentary on the ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra''. Venerable [[Hsuan Hua]] was a major modern proponent of the ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'', which he commented and used in his instructions on protecting and supporting the Proper Dharma. About the ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'', he said:

{{quote|In Buddhism all the sutras are very important, but the ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'' is most important. Wherever the ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'' is, the Proper Dharma abides in the world. When the ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'' is gone, the Dharma Ending Age is before one's eyes. (In the ''Extinction of the Dharma Sutra'' it says that in the Dharma Ending Age, the ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'' will become extinct first. Then gradually the other sutras will also become extinct.)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cttbusa.org/shurangama/shurangama2.asp |title=The Buddha Speaks the Ultimate Extinction of the Dharma Sutra |website=City of Ten Thousand Buddhas |series=Taisho 396 |access-date=2017-12-04 |quote=However, within fifty-two years the Shurangama Sutra and the Pratyutpanna [Standing Buddha] Samadhi, will be the first to change and then to disappear. The twelve divisions of the canon will gradually follow until they vanish completely, never to appear again.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'' is the true body of the Buddha; the [[sarira|śarīra]] (relics) of the Buddha; the stūpa of the Buddha. All Buddhists must support with their utmost strength The ''Śūraṅgama Sūtra'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://book.bfnn.org/books2/1329.htm |title=Dà fó dǐng shǒu léng yán jīng juàn yi qiǎn shì |script-title=zh:大佛頂首楞嚴經卷一淺釋 |website=般若文海 (website trans. to English : Prajñā Library) |authors=宣化上人 (trans. to English: Ven.
