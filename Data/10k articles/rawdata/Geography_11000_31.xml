      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1020">'''Absyrtides''' or '''Apsyrtides''' or '''Apsirtides''' ({{lang-grc|Ἀψυρτίδες}}) was a collective name of two islands off the coast of [[Illyricum (Roman province)|Illyricum]] &amp;ndash; [[Cres]] and [[Lošinj]], which were almost attached. The name recalls [[Absyrtus]], who according to one tradition, was slain here by his sister [[Medea]] and by [[Jason]]. [[Ptolemy]] mentions only one island, ''Apsorrus'' (Ἄψορρος), on which he places two towns [[Cres (town)|Crepsa]] (Κρέψα) (the modern [[Cres (town)|Cres]]) and [[Osor, Croatia|Apsorrus]] (the modern [[Osor, Croatia|Osor]], now all in [[Croatia]]).

'''Alofi''' is the capital of the Pacific Ocean island nation of [[Niue]]. With a population of less than 1,000 (census of 2014){{needs citation|date=June 2017}}, Alofi has the distinction of being the second smallest national capital city in terms of population (after [[Ngerulmud]], capital of [[Palau]]). It consists of the two villages: '''Alofi North''' and '''Alofi South''' where the government headquarters are located.&lt;ref name="SPC2008-4"/&gt;

==History==
In January 2004, Niue was hit by the fierce tropical storm [[Cyclone Heta]] which killed two people and did extensive damage to the entire island. Many of Alofi's buildings were destroyed, including the hospital. Government buildings were shifted to a less exposed site {{convert|3|km|abbr=on}} inland from the west coast, named '''Fonuakula''', after the storm.&lt;ref name=heta&gt;[[#heta|East-West Center]]&lt;/ref&gt; This site is still within the village boundaries of Alofi South.

==Geography==
===Overview===
It is located at the centre of [[Alofi Bay]] on the west coast of the island, close to the only break in the [[coral reef]] that surrounds Niue. The bay stretches for 30% of the island's length (about seven kilometres) from [[Halagigie Point]] in the south to Makapu Point in the north.

The council's territory borders with [[Avatele]], [[Hakupu]], [[Lakepa]], [[Liku]], [[Makefu]], [[Mutalau]], [[Tamakautoga]] and [[Tuapa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{OSM|r|1558549|Alofi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Alofi features a [[tropical rainforest climate]] under the [[Köppen climate classification]], with no discernible [[dry season]]. The city has a noticeably drier stretch from June through September. However, all of these months average more than {{convert|60|mm|abbr=on}} of rain, the limit for a dry season month. Average temperatures vary slightly throughout the course of the year in Alofi hovering at around {{convert|27|C}}, during the warmest month (February) and at around {{convert|23|C}} during the coolest months (July and August) .
{{clear left}}

==Transport==
The town is serviced by [[Niue International Airport]], and there are numerous roads, both paved and dirt, that crisscross the town.&lt;ref&gt;[http://worldaerodata.com/wad.cgi?id=NE45256&amp;sch=NIUE Niue International Airport]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Alsat-1B''' is an Algerian satellite operated by the [[Agence Spatiale Algerienne]] for agricultural and disaster monitoring.&lt;ref name=ss&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.sstl.co.uk/Missions/Alsat-1B/Alsat-1B/Alsat-1B--The-Mission |title=Alsat-1B satellite mission |website=Surrey Satellite Technology Limited |date=2014-07-10 |accessdate=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="gunter"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://space.skyrocket.de/doc_sdat/alsat-1b.htm |title=AlSat 1B |publisher=Gunter's Space Page |date=2014-07-10 |accessdate=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; The contract for the mission was signed in July 2014. The satellite is based on the SSTL-100 bus. The satellite weighs {{convert|103|kg}} and carries an earth imaging payload with {{convert|12|m|ft|adj=on}} panchromatic imager and {{convert|24|m|ft|adj=on}} multispectral cameras.&lt;ref name="sf"&gt;{{cite web|first1=William|last1=Graham |url=https://www.nasaspaceflight.com/2016/09/isro-pslv-scatsat-1-launch/ |title=ISRO PSLV conducts SCATSAT-1 launch |publisher=NASASpaceFlight.com |date= |accessdate=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ss /&gt;

==Construction==
The satellite had high participation from ASAL, with eighteen engineers that worked on assembly, integration, and test. Additionally, at the University of Surrey, 18 students used the satellite as a part of their graduate degree research.&lt;ref name="ss" /&gt;

==Launch==
The satellite was launched on 26 September 2016 into a {{convert|670|km|mi|adj=on}} altitude polar orbit by [[ISRO]] using the [[PSLV-C35]] rocket.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://indianexpress.com/article/opinion/web-edits/pslv-c35-launch-double-orbit-satellite-deployment-boosts-isros-commercial-prospects-3050686/ |title=PSLV-C35 launch: Double orbit satellite deployment boosts ISRO’s commercial prospects |publisher=The Indian Express |date=1976-09-27 |accessdate=2016-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was launched with several other satellites. The primary payload was SCATSAT 1, which was launched into a Polar Sun Synchronous Orbit. This was the first time PSLV launched satellites into different orbits. Algeria had three satellites that it will operate launch in that group, which were AlSat-1B, AlSat 2B, and AlSat-Nano. AlSat-2B also had imaging capabilities, but they are higher  resolution than AlSat-1B. Of the eight satellites launched by PSLV, five of them were foreign. The remaining satellites were BlackSky Pathfinder 1, Pratham, PISat, and CanX 7.&lt;ref name="gunter" /&gt;&lt;ref name="sf" /&gt;

Alsat-1B uses three body mounted solar panels for power generation, and a 15 Amp-hour Li-Ion battery for power storage. It uses warm gas, butane powered resistojets for propulsion.&lt;ref name="gunter" /&gt; The attitude control system uses sun sensors and magnetometers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://spaceflight101.com/pslv-c35/alsat-1b/|title=AlSat-1B|access-date=2016-10-30|website=Spaceflight101.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Bioversity International''' is a global research-for-development organization with a vision – that [[agricultural biodiversity]] nourishes people and sustains the planet. The organization delivers scientific evidence, management practices and policy options to use and safeguard [[agricultural biodiversity]] to attain global [[food security|food]] and nutrition security, working with partners in low-income countries in different regions where agricultural biodiversity can contribute to improved nutrition, resilience, productivity and [[climate change adaptation]].

Bioversity International is a member of the [[CGIAR]], a global research partnership for a food-secure future.

The organization is highly decentralized, with about 300 staff working around the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioversityinternational.org/about-us/where-we-work/ Where Bioversity International works]&lt;/ref&gt; Its headquarters are in [[Maccarese]], outside Rome, Italy, with regional offices located in Central and South America, West and Central Africa, East and Southern Africa, Central and South Asia, and South-east Asia.

== Background ==
Bioversity International is a research-for-development organization focused on safeguarding and using [[agricultural biodiversity]] to help meet challenges such as adaptation to [[climate change]] and increased [[sustainable production]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioversityinternational.org/e-library/publications/detail/bioversity-internationals-10-year-strategy-2014-2024 Bioversity International 10-year Strategy 2014-2024]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The organization takes the view that the diversity of plants and animals offers opportunities not only through [[Sexual reproduction|breeding]] but also by delivering many other benefits. Some are direct, such as the better nutrition and greater sustainability that come with locally-adapted crops. Others are indirect, like the [[ecosystem services]] delivered by healthy populations of [[pollinator]]s, [[biological control]] agents, and [[soil microbes]]. Agricultural biodiversity will also be absolutely essential to cope with the predicted impacts of climate change, not simply as a source of traits but as the underpinnings of more resilient farm ecosystems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioversityinternational.org/e-library/publications/detail/agricultural-biodiversity-is-essential-for-a-sustainable-improvement-in-food-and-nutrition-security Frison, E.A.; Cherfas, J.; Hodgkin, T. Agricultural Biodiversity Is Essential for a Sustainable Improvement in Food and Nutrition Security. Sustainability 2011, 3, 238-253.]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Governance ==
Bioversity International is governed by a Board of Trustees, including one Trustee nominated by the host country (Italy) and one nominated by [[FAO]]. The Board also appoints the Director General who manages the operation of the various programs. The current Director General, M. Ann Tutwiler&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.cgiar.org/about-us/our-governance/center-director-generals/profile/tutwiler/|title=CGIAR Center Director Generals - Bioversity International|last=|first=|date=|website=www.cgiar.org|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;, will remain in her position until the end of 2018.

==History==
In 2014, Bioversity International marked 40 years of operations. Bioversity International was originally established by the CGIAR as the International Board for [[Plant Genetic Resources]] (IBPGR) in 1974. In October 1991, IBPGR became the International Plant Genetic Resources Institute (IPGRI) and in 1994 IPGRI began independent operation as one of the centers of the CGIAR. At the request of the CGIAR, in 1994 IPGRI took over the governance and administration of the International Network for the Improvement of Banana and Plantain (INIBAP). In 2006, IPGRI and INIBAP became a single organization and subsequently changed their operating name to Bioversity International. Bioversity International still maintains the world's largest banana [[genetic database|gene bank]], the Bioversity International ''Musa'' Germplasm Transit Centre, that is hosted at the [[KU Leuven|Katholieke Universiteit Leuven]] (KU Leuven) in Leuven, Belgium, and manages [[ProMusa]] - a platform that shares knowledge about [[Banana|bananas]] and [[Cooking banana|plantains]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bioversityinternational.org/about-us/who-we-are/history/ Bioversity International history]&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, the [[Crop Trust|Global Crop Diversity Trust]] was established by Bioversity International on behalf of the CGIAR and the [[Food and Agriculture Organization|UN Food and Agriculture Organization]], through a Crop Diversity Endowment Fund&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://time.com/doomsday-vault/|title=Inside the 'Doomsday' Vault|last=|first=|date=|work=TIME|access-date=26 January 2018|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Publications==
Bioversity International and its predecessors have published occasional papers under the title ''Issues in Genetic Resources''. In 2017, the organization published ''Mainstreaming Agrobiodiversity In Sustainable Food Systems - Scientific Foundations for an Agrobiodiversity Index'', a book that put the spotlight on the importance of [[Agricultural biodiversity|agrobiodiversity]] as the foundation of our food supplies&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2017/sep/26/sixth-mass-extinction-of-wildlife-also-threatens-global-food-supplies|title=Sixth mass extinction of wildlife also threatens global food supplies|last=|first=|date=|website=The Guardian|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="27706">'''Cartographic propaganda''' is a map created with the goal of achieving a result similar to traditional [[propaganda]]. The map can be outright falsified, or created using subjectivity with the goal of persuasion.&lt;ref&gt;Tyner, 1974&lt;/ref&gt;  The idea that maps are subjective is not new; cartographers refer to maps as a human-subjective product and some view cartography as an "industry, which packages and markets spatial knowledge"&lt;ref name="Sorrell 1981"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Sorrell|first=P.E.|title=Cartography: A manufacturing industry concerned with the Processing, Transformation, Packaging and Transportation of Spatial Data|journal=The Cartographic Journal|date=December 1981|volume=18|issue=2|pages=84–90|doi=10.1179/caj.1981.18.2.84}}&lt;/ref&gt;  or as a communicative device distorted by human subjectivity.&lt;ref name="Wood 1972"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wood|first=Michael|title=Human Factors in Cartographic Communication|journal=The Cartographic Journal|date=December 1972|volume=9|issue=2|pages=123–132|doi=10.1179/caj.1972.9.2.123}}&lt;/ref&gt;  However, cartographic [[propaganda]] is widely successful because maps are often presented as a miniature model of reality, and it is a rare occurrence that a map is referred to as a distorted model, which sometimes can "lie" and contain items that are completely different from reality.&lt;ref name="Boardman 1983"&gt;{{cite book|last=Boardman|first=David|title=Graphicacy and Geography Teaching|year=1983|publisher=Croom Helm|location=London|pages=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because the word propaganda has become a pejorative, it has been suggested that mapmaking of this kind should be described as “persuasive cartography,” defined as maps intended primarily to influence opinions or beliefs – to send a message – rather than to communicate geographic information.&lt;ref&gt;Tyner, Judith A. (2015). "Persuasive Cartography.” In ''Cartography in the Twentieth Century'', ed. Mark Monmonier, 1087-95. Vol. 6 of ''The History of Cartography''.

== History ==

[[File:T and O map Guntherus Ziner 1472.jpg|thumb|Earliest printed example of a classical T and O map (by [[Günther Zainer]], Augsburg, 1472), illustrating the first page of chapter XIV of the ''Etymologiae'' of Isidore of Seville.  It shows the continents as domains of the sons of [[Noah]]: Sem ([[Shem]]), Iafeth ([[Japheth]]) and Cham ([[Ham, son of Noah|Ham]]).]]

The [[T-O map]] is a historical example of cartographic propaganda during the Middle Ages.  During the Renaissance maps became more widely used in general and their use began to take on a more cultural and political character, more similar to the cartographic propaganda that is seen today.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 16"&gt;Barber and Harper 2010, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;  This use was especially practiced in Italy, where the competition for resources between city states in the central and northern Italian heartlands led to a precocious awareness of the practical utility of maps for military and strategic purposes, as well as civilian uses such as the planning of forts, canals, and aqueducts.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 16"/&gt;  In sequence, the usage of cartographic propaganda has increased remarkably alongside the rise of the [[Modern history|modern]] [[State (polity)|state]] (Black 1997; 2008).

The interwar period in Germany fostered the development of cartographic propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;(Boria 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Nazi propaganda|German propagandists]] discovered the advantages of cartography in the re-representation of reality.&lt;ref name="Speier 1941"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Speier|first=Hans|title=Magic Geography|journal=Social Research: an International Quarterly|date=Fall 1941|volume=8|issue=3|pages=310–330}}&lt;/ref&gt;   For the Nazi regime, the most important goal in producing maps was their efficiency in providing communication between the ruler and the masses.&lt;ref name="Speier 1941" /&gt;  The use of maps in this manner can be referred to as "suggestive cartography," as being capable of dynamic representations of power.

This period of geopolitical cartographic development was a continuous process associated with [[Nazis]] and [[World War II]]; the development of cartographic propaganda is closely related to the wider Nazi propaganda machine (Tyner 1974). There were three different categories of propaganda maps that were used by the Nazi propaganda machine; (1) maps used to illustrate the condition of Germany as a people and nation are identified; (2) maps taking an aim at the morale of the Allies via a mental offensive through maps specifically designed to keep the U.S. neutral in the war by changing the perception of threats; and (3) maps as blue-prints of the post-war world.  During this period, this approach to cartography expanded to [[Italy]], [[Spain]], and [[Portugal]] as cartographers and propagandists found inspiration in the "positivistic trends of the German world."&lt;ref&gt;(Boria 2007, Cairo 2007)&lt;/ref&gt;

This more overt use of maps as propaganda continued into the Cold War period.  Post-[[World War II]] U.S. cartographers modified projections to create a menacing image of the [[Soviet Union]] by making the Soviet Union appear larger and thus more threatening.  This approach was also applied to other nearby communist countries, thereby accentuating the rise of [[communism]] as a whole.  The April 1, 1946, issue of ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]'' published a map entitled 'Communist Contagion,' which focused on the communist threat of the Soviet Union.  In this map the strength of the Soviet Union was enhanced by a split-spherical presentation of [[Europe]] and [[Asia]] which made the [[Soviet Union]] seem larger as a result of the break in the center of the map.  Communist expansion was also emphasized in this map as it presented the Soviet Union in a vivid red color, a color commonly associated with danger (and communism as a whole), and categorized neighboring states in terms of the danger of contagion, using the language of disease (states were referred to as quarantined, infected or exposed, adding to the presentation of these countries as dangerous or threatening).  More generally, during the Cold War period, small-scale maps served to make dangers appear menacing; some maps were made to make Vietnam appear close to [[Singapore]] and [[Australia]]; or [[Afghanistan]] to the Indian Ocean (Black 1997; 2008). Similarly, maps illustrating rocket positions used a polar azimuth projection with the North Pole at its center, which gave the map reader the perception that there existed a relatively small distance between the countries on opposing sides of the [[Cold War]].&lt;ref&gt;(Black 2008)&lt;/ref&gt;

== Methods ==
Scale, map projection, and symbolization are characteristics of cartography that can be selectively applied that will therefore transform a map into cartographic propaganda.

=== Scale and generalization ===
[[Scale (map)|Scales]] are used to relate distance because maps are usually smaller than the area they represent.&lt;ref&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because of the need for a scale, the cartographer often makes use of map generalization as a way to ensure clarity.&lt;ref&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 25.&lt;/ref&gt;  The size of the scale affects the use of generalization; a smaller scale forces a higher level of generalization.

There are two types of [[Cartographic generalization|map generalization]]; geometric and content.  The methods of geometric generalization are selection, simplification, displacement, smoothing, and enhancement.&lt;ref&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt;  Content generalization promotes clarity of the purpose or meaning of a map by filtering out details irrelevant to the map's function or theme.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 35"&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  Content generalization has two essential elements; selection and classification.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 35"/&gt;  Selection serves to suppress information and classification is the choice of relevant features.
[[File:Lemierre The Voyage of Youth to the Land of Happiness 1802 Cornell CUL PJM 1030 01.jpg|thumbnail|Allegorical Map with navigation symbols of the Voyage of Youth to the Land of Happiness, 1802]]
=== Map projection ===
[[Map projection]] is the method of presenting the curved, three-dimensional surface of the planet into a flat, two-dimensional plane.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 8"&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 8.&lt;/ref&gt;   The flat map, even with a constant scale, stretches some distances and shortens others, and varies the scale from point to point.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 8"/&gt;   Choice of map projection affects the map's size, shape, distance and/or direction.  Map projection has been used to create cartographic propaganda by making small areas bigger and large areas bigger still.&lt;ref&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 94.&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Arno Peters]]' attack on the [[Mercator Projection]] in 1972 is an example of the subjectivity of map projection; Peters argued that it is an ethnocentric projection.&lt;ref name="Crampton 2010"&gt;(Crampton 2010)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Symbolization ===
[[Map symbolization|Symbols]] are used in maps to complement map scale and projection by making visible the features, places, and other locational information represented on a map.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 18"&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 18.&lt;/ref&gt;  Because map symbolization describes and differentiates features and places, "map symbols serve as a geographic code for storing and retrieving data in a two-dimensional geographic framework."&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 18"/&gt;  Map symbolization tells the map reader what is relevant and what is not.&lt;ref&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt;  As a result, the selection of symbols can be done subjectively and with a propagandistic intent.

== Historical themes ==
The map is the perfect symbol of the state and has thus been used throughout history as a symbol of power and nationhood.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996"&gt;Monmonier 1996&lt;/ref&gt;  As a symbol the map has served many purposes of the state including the exertion of rule, legitimation of rule, assertion of national unity, and was even used for the mobilization of war.

=== Exerting imperial rule in medieval and renaissance Europe ===
[[File:Fra Mauro World Map, c.1450.jpg|thumbnail|Fra Mauro World Map, 1450]]
Cartographic propaganda in Medieval Europe spoke to the emotions rather than to reason and often reflected the prestige of empires.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 52"&gt;Barber and Harper 2010, p. 52.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fra Mauro map|The Fra Mauro World Map]] (1450) was intended for display in Venice and shows the Portuguese discoveries in Africa and emphasizes the feats of Marco Polo.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 52"/&gt;  The British East India Company commissioned a copy in 1804, implying that Britain was heir to the Portuguese empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Fra Mauro World Map|url=http://www.bl.uk/magnificentmaps/map2.html|work=Magnificant Maps: Power, Propaganda, and Art|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

"The Americas" (1562) was created by [[Diego Gutiérrez (cartographer)|Diego Gutiérrez]] and serves as a powerful celebration of Spain's New World Empire.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The americas|url=http://www.bl.uk/magnificentmaps/map3.html|work=Magnificant Maps: Power, Propaganda, and Art|publisher=The British Library|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In this map, King Philip II is shown riding the turbulent Atlantic Ocean on a chariot; this illustration is reminiscent of the Roman God Neptune.  References like this were intended to strengthen Spain's image in Europe and its claim to the Americas.

European rulers often tried to intimidate visiting envoys by displaying maps of their masters' lands and forts, with the implication that the maps were a first step towards conquest.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 35"&gt;Barber and Harper 2010, p. 35.&lt;/ref&gt;  For example, in 1527, during festivities for the French ambassador in England, maps depicting aerial views of French towns being successfully besieged by the English decorated the walls of a Greenwich pavilion specially built for the ambassador's visit.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 35"/&gt;

=== Legitimizing colonial rule ===
Colonial powers used the map as an intellectual tool to legitimize territorial conquest.&lt;ref&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt;  Ramsay Muir's "Cambridge Modern Historical Atlas" (Cambridge, 1912) compiled a selection of British triumphs.  Less glorious and unsuccessful earlier struggles with the Mysore and the Marathas were ignored.&lt;ref name="Black 2003" /&gt;

Maps during the colonial period were also used to organize and rank the rest of the world according to the European powers.&lt;ref name="Black 2003"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Black|first=Jeremy|title=Mapping the Past: Historical Atlases|journal=Orbis|date=Spring 2003|pages=277–291}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Edward Quin]] used color to depict civilization in "Historical Atlas in a Series of Maps of the World" (London, 1830).  In the introduction of the atlas Quin wrote, "we have covered alike in all the periods with a flat olive shading...barbarous and uncivilized countries such as the interior of Africa at the present moment."&lt;ref name="Black 2003" /&gt;

=== Asserting national unity ===
A single overview map of an entire country serves as an assertion of national unity.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 88"&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 88.&lt;/ref&gt;  The national atlas commissioned during the rule of Elizabeth I bound together maps of the various English counties and asserted their unity under Elizabeth's rule.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 88"/&gt;  A few decades later, Henry VI of France celebrated the reunification of his kingdom {{dubious|date=June 2017}} through the creation of the atlas, "Le theatre francoys."&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 89"&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 89.&lt;/ref&gt;  The atlas includes an impressive engraving proclaiming the glory of king and kingdom.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 89"/&gt;

=== Political use in the 19th and 20th centuries ===
[[File:Angling in troubled waters – a serio-comic map of Europe - Kungliga Biblioteket - 2818247-thumb.png|thumb|Angling in troubled waters – a serio-comic map of Europe - National Library of Sweden]]
In the later nineteenth and twentieth centuries the political potential of cartographic shapes became used more widely and began to be used for more blatantly propagandistic purposes.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 161"&gt;Barber and Harper 2010, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;  Map and globe can be used as symbols for abstract ideas because they are familiar to the masses and they harbor emotive connotations.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 161"/&gt;  Maps are often incorporated as an emblematic element in a larger design or are used to provide the visual framework on which a scenario is played out.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 161"/&gt;

Fred W. Rose created two propaganda posters depicting the British general election in 1880 in which he used the map of England, "Comic Map of the British Isles indicating the Political Situation in 1880" and "The overthrow of His Imperial Majesty King Jingo I: A Map of the Political Situation in 1880 by Nemesis.".&lt;ref&gt;Barber and Harper 2010, p. 162.&lt;/ref&gt; He was also the creator of the 1899  "Angling in troubled waters".

Henri Dron used the figure of the world map in the 1869 propaganda poster, "L'Europe des Points Noirs."&lt;ref&gt;Barber and Harper 2010, p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Coaxing during World War I and II ===

[[File:Maurice Neumont, War is the National Industry of Prussia, 1917, Cornell CUL PJM 1185 01.jpg|thumb|This French propaganda poster from 1917 portrayed Prussia as the octopus]]

Cartographic propaganda during WWI and WWII was used to polarize states along the lines of war and did so by appealing to the masses.  Fred Rose's "Serio-comic war map for the year 1877" portrayed the [[Russian Empire]] as an octopus stretching out its tentacles vying for control in Europe and was intended to solicit distrust of the Russian Empire within Europe.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 164"&gt;Barber and Harper 2010, p. 164.&lt;/ref&gt;   This concept was used again in 1917 during WWI, when France commissioned a map which portrayed Prussia as the octopus.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 164"/&gt; The octopus appeared again in 1942 as [[Vichy France|(Vichy) France]] intended to sustain its citizens' morale and cast [[Winston Churchill]] as the octopus, a demonic green-faced, red-lipped, cigar-smoking creature attempting to seize Africa and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Barber and Harper 2010, p. 165.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Targets ==
Political persuasion often concerns [[Territorial dispute|territorial claims]], [[Nationality|nationalities]], [[Nationalism|national pride]], [[border]]s, strategic positions, [[Conquest (military)|conquests]], attacks, troop movements, defenses, [[Sphere of influence|spheres of influence]], regional inequality, etc.&lt;ref&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 87.&lt;/ref&gt;  The goal of cartographic propaganda is to mold the map’s message by emphasizing supporting features while suppressing contradictory information.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996"/&gt;   Successful cartographic propaganda is geared toward an audience.

=== Political leadership ===

Before the U.S. had entered into WWII, U.S. President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] came to possess a German map of Central and South America that depicted all Latin American republics reduced to “five vassal states...bringing the whole continent under their (Nazi) domination.”&lt;ref name="Bratzel and Rout"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Bratzel|first=John, F. |author2=Leslie B. Rout, Jr. |title=FDR and the 'Secret Map'|journal=The Wilson Quarterly|year=1976|volume=9|issue=1|pages=167–173}}&lt;/ref&gt;   FDR viewed this as an open threat to “our great life line, the [[Panama Canal]]" and therefore mean that “the Nazi design is not only against South America, but against the U.S. as well.”&lt;ref name="Bratzel and Rout"/&gt;  This map was undoubtedly propaganda, yet its target audience could have either been the German or American public.  The map was first discovered by the British and then brought to the attention of FDR.  Although Berlin claimed that it was a [[forgery]], the origin of the map is still unknown.&lt;ref name="Bratzel and Rout"/&gt;

Some Nazi maps were commissioned as an attempt to divert sympathy from Britain and deter Allied aggression.  The Nazi map, "A Study in Empires" compares the size of Germany (264,300 sq. mi) to that of the British Empire (13,320,854 sq.  mi), arguing that Britain, not Germany, is the aggressor nation.&lt;ref&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 102.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Nazi regime also used maps to persuade the United States to remain neutral during WWII by flattering both isolationism and [[Monroe Doctrine]] militarism.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 107"&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;  "Spheres of Influence," created and published in 1941, uses bold lines traced around sections of the globe to send a clear message to Americans: stay in your own hemisphere and out of Europe.&lt;ref name="Monmonier 1996, p. 107"/&gt;

=== Military leadership ===
Cartographic propaganda can be used to mislead the enemy and its military by [[Disinformation|distorting]] maps and the information they contain which is used in military strategic planning.&lt;ref&gt;Monmonier 1996, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1958 the Soviet Union launched the Soviet Map Distortion Policy which resulted in the thinning and distortion of detail in all unclassified maps.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.foia.cia.gov/sites/default/files/document_conversions/89801/DOC_0000498616.pdf|title=Soviet Map Distortion Policy|publisher=CIA.gov|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   Then in 1988 the Soviet Union’s chief cartographer, Viktor R. Yashchenko, admitted that Soviet maps had been faked for nearly 50 years.&lt;ref name=Keller&gt;{{cite news|last=Keller|first=Bill|title=Soviet Aide Admits Maps Were Faked for 50 Years|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/09/03/world/soviet-aide-admits-maps-were-faked-for-50-years.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm|accessdate=28 October 2012|newspaper=The New York Times|date=September 3, 1988}}&lt;/ref&gt;   The Soviet Union had deliberately falsified virtually all public maps of the country, misplacing streets, distorting boundaries, and omitting geographical features.&lt;ref name=Keller /&gt;   These were orders administered by the Soviet secret police.  Western experts said the maps were distorted out of fear of aerial bombing or foreign intelligence operations.&lt;ref name=Keller /&gt;

=== The masses ===

Cartographic propaganda during the Cold War often appealed to the fear of the masses.  During the Cold War period, maps of “us” versus “them” were drawn to emphasize the threat represented by the USSR and its allies.&lt;ref name=Walbert&gt;{{cite web|last=Walbert|first=David|title=Map skills and higher-order thinking|url=http://www.learnnc.org/lp/editions/mapping/6434|publisher=Learn NC|accessdate=28 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

R.M. Chapin, Jr. created the map, “Europe From Moscow,” in 1952.  The map was drawn from a different perspective, from Moscow looking onward toward Europe which made it easy for the map reader to imagine (red) armies sweeping across Western Europe.&lt;ref name=Walbert /&gt;

=== The classroom ===
[[Adolf Hitler|Adolf Hitler's]]  schoolroom map of "Deutschland" in 1935 presented all the German-speaking areas surrounding Germany without borders, claiming them as part of the [[Reich]] .&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 159"&gt;Barber and Harper 2010, p. 159.&lt;/ref&gt;   This gave the impression that the Reich extended over Austria and the German-speaking areas in Poland, Czechoslovakia, and even France.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 159"/&gt;

M. Tomasik created the "Pictorial Map of European Russia," which was published in Warsaw in 1896 and 1903, provoked an image of Utopia in Russia.  The map was intended for display in Polish schools and was meant to appeal directly to the emotions of teachers and through them to those they taught.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 156"&gt;Barber and Harper 2010, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;  The map illustrated Russia as a nation rich in natural resources and failed to mention the [[Russian famine of 1891-1892|famine]] that occurred only five years earlier (1891-5) during which half a million people had died.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 156"/&gt;   The map also communicated the message of Russian unity; the nation's provinces were shown linked together by a new rail network and contributing to the nation's well-being.&lt;ref name="Barber and Harper 2010, p. 156"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1329">The '''Sahand-Bazman Volcanic and Plutonic Belt''' or the '''Sahand-Bazman Igneous Arc''' or the '''Central Iranian Range''' is a mountain range that is made by (both extrusive and intrusive) igneous and pyroclastic rocks. Located East and almost parallel to the [[Zagros Mountains]], the Central Iranian Range is stretched in a north-west-southeast direction from Mount Sahand in Azerbaijan in the north-west to Mount Bazman in Baluchistan in the Southeastern part of [[Iran]].&lt;ref&gt;Microsoft Encarta World Atlas, 2001, Microsoft Corporation&lt;/ref&gt; This range was mainly formed during the [[Tertiary]] volcanic and orogenic phase and especially in the [[Eocene]] volcanism and plutonism.&lt;ref&gt;Geological Map of Iran, National Geoscience Database of Iran, www.ngdir.ir&lt;/ref&gt; The Central Iranian Range or the Sahand-Bazman Volcanic Belt includes famous mountains such as the [[Sahand]] in [[East Azerbaijan Province]], Mount Karkas in the [[Karkas Mountains]] and [[Mount Marshenan]] in [[Isfahan Province]], the [[Jebal Barez]], [[Mount Hezar]] and [[Mount Lalehzar]] in [[Kerman Province]], and the [[Bazman]] in the [[Sistan va Baluchestan Province]] of Iran.

In [[geomorphology]], a '''col''' is the lowest point on a mountain [[ridge]] between two [[Summit|peaks]].&lt;ref name="Whittow"&gt;Whittow, John (1984). ''Dictionary of Physical Geography''. London: Penguin, 1984, p. 103. {{ISBN|0-14-051094-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; It may also be called a '''gap'''.&lt;ref name="Whittow"/&gt; Particularly rugged and forbidding cols in the terrain are usually referred to as '''notches'''. They are generally unsuitable as [[mountain pass]]es, but are occasionally crossed by [[mule]] tracks or climbers' routes. The term col tends to be associated more with mountain rather than hill ranges.&lt;ref&gt;Chambers 21st Century Dictionary, Allied.&lt;/ref&gt;

The height of a summit above its highest col (called the [[key col]]) is effectively a measure of a mountain's [[topographic prominence]]. Cols lie on the line of the [[drainage divide|watershed]] between two [[mountain]]s, often on a prominent ridge or [[arête]]. For example, the highest col in Austria, the ''Obere Glocknerscharte'' ("Upper Glockner Col", {{Höhe|3766|AT|link=true}}), lies between the [[Kleinglockner]] ({{Höhe|3783|AT}}) and [[Großglockner]] ({{Höhe|3798|AT}}) mountains, giving the Kleinglockner a minimum prominence of 17&amp;nbsp;metres.&lt;ref&gt;Willi End, Hubert Peterka: ''Alpenvereinsführer Glockner- und Granatspitzgruppe'', Bergverlag Rudolf Rother, Munich, 1990. {{ISBN|3-7633-1258-7}} [http://www.rother.de/titpage/1266.php]&lt;/ref&gt;

The majority of cols are unnamed and are either never transited or only crossed in the course of negotiating a ridge line. Many [[double summit]]s are separated by prominent cols. The distinction with other names for breaks in mountain ridges such as saddle, [[wind gap]] or notch is not sharply defined and may vary from place to place.

'''[[Colluvium]]-filled bedrock hollows ''' are the cause of many shallow earth [[landslides]] in steep mountainous terrain.  They can form as a U or a V shaped trough as local [[bedrock]] variations reveal areas in the bedrock which are more prone to weathering than other locations on the slope.  As the [[weathering|weathered]] [[bedrock]] turns to [[soil]], there is a greater elevation difference between the soil level and the hard bedrock.  With the introduction of water and the thick soil, there is less cohesion and the soil flows out in a landslide. With every landslide more bedrock is scoured out and the hollow becomes deeper.  After time, colluvium fills the hollow, and the sequence starts again.

He and his wife Elizabeth Clemens (1826–1854) went to [[Guangzhou]] (then [[Postal Map Romanization|known as]] "Canton") in March 1852, having been posted there by the [[American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions]].&lt;ref name=ride4&gt;{{harvp|Ride &amp; al.|1996|p=[https://books.google.com/books?id=flbXWNoVraEC&amp;pg=PA114 114]}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Soon after their arrival, he wrote to ''[[Scientific American]]'', with questions regarding the use of [[daguerrotype|photographs]] in [[magic lantern]]s, the standard American methods of [[rice]] cleaning, and the use of [[india rubber]] in [[printing press]]es.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Vrooman |first=Daniel |contribution=Letter from China |title=Scientific American, ''Vol. VIII, No. 17'' |url=https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/5/51/Scientific_American_-_Series_1_-_Volume_008_-_Issue_17.pdf |p=130 |date=8 January 1853 |location=New York |publisher=Munn &amp; Co. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although Guangzhou had been opened to foreign trade by the 1842 [[Treaty of Nanjing]] ending the [[First Opium War]], access to the walled cities of the [[Manchu people|Manchus]] and [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] continued to be denied to foreigners, who were mostly kept to the mercantile ghetto of the [[Thirteen Factories]] on the southern shore of the [[Xiguan|western suburbs]].

Elizabeth died in [[Portuguese Macao|Macao]] in 1854 and he remarried three years later&lt;ref name=ride4/&gt; to Maria Wilberforce (1836–1866). He served as the American vice-[[Consul (representative)|consul]] and was said to have introduced [[Cotton-spinning machinery|mechanized cotton spinning]] to the city.{{sfn|''Abe''}} In 1863, he published a [[Cantonese language|Cantonese]] phonetic alphabet of his own devising.&lt;ref name=ride4/&gt;

==Later life==
Vrooman retired from the ABCFM's Guangzhou mission in 1866&lt;ref name=replaceme/&gt; or '67,&lt;ref name=ride4/&gt; but continued to work as an independent missionary in Guangzhou until 1878.&lt;ref name=replaceme/&gt;

In 1878, he was made superintendent over a mission to the [[Chinese Australians|Chinese]] in [[Victoria, Australia|Victoria]], [[Colonial Australia|Australia]].&lt;ref name=ride4/&gt; He retired from this post in 1881.&lt;ref name=ride4/&gt;

He died in [[Oakland, California|Oakland]], [[California]], on 3 March 1895.&lt;ref name=replaceme/&gt;

[[File:Desire line.jpg|200px|thumb|A typical desire path]]
A '''desire path''' (often referred to as '''desire line''' in transportation planning, and also known as a '''game trail''', '''social trail''', '''herd path''', '''cow path''', '''goat track''', '''pig trail, use trail''' or '''bootleg trail''') is a path created as a consequence of erosion caused by human or animal foot-fall traffic. The path usually represents the shortest or most easily navigated route between an origin and destination. Width and erosion severity can be indicators of how much traffic a path receives. Desire paths emerge as shortcuts where constructed ways take a circuitous route, have gaps, or are non-existent.

==Parks and nature areas==
[[File:Country desire path at Woodland Trust wood Theydon Bois Essex England.JPG|thumb|right|A desire line created path defined by clover through a designated protected woodland and wildlife area at [[Theydon Bois]] in [[Essex]], England]]
Desire paths sometimes cut through sensitive habitats and off-limit areas, threatening wildlife and park security. However, they also provide an indicator to park management of activity concentration. The [[National Park Service]] unit at the [[Yosemite National Park]] in the United States of America uses this indicator to help establish its General Management Plan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lubell|first1=Mark|title=ESP172 Lecture 9: National Parks|url=http://www.des.ucdavis.edu/faculty/lubell/Teaching/ESP172/Lecture9Parks.pdf|publisher=University of California, Davis}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Munkkivuori footpath August 24 2011.png|300px|thumb|left|A desire path (right) merges with a footpath (center) in [[Helsinki]], Finland]]
Trampling studies have consistently documented that impacts on soil and vegetation occur rapidly with initial use of desire paths. As few as 15 passages over a site can be enough to create a distinct trail, the existence of which then attracts further use.&lt;ref name=soft&gt;{{cite book|last1=Hampton|first1=Bruce|last2=Cole|first2=David|title=Soft paths: how to enjoy the wilderness without harming it|date=1988|publisher=Stackpole Books|location=Harrisburg, PA|isbn=0-8117-2234-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|27}} This finding contributed to the creation of the [[Leave No Trace]] education program, which, among other things, teaches that travelers in nature areas should either stay on designated trails or, when off trail, distribute their travel lines so as to not inadvertently create new trails in unsustainable locations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Marion|first1=Jeffrey L.|last2=Reid|first2=Scott E.|title=Development of the U.S. Leave No Trace Program: An Historical Perspective|url=https://lnt.org/sites/default/files/Leave_No_Trace_History_Paper.pdf|website=Leave No Trace: Center for Outdoor Ethics|date=January 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Land managers have devised a variety of techniques to block the creation of desire paths including fences, dense vegetation, or signage. However, hikers still penetrate these barriers. Because of this, state of the art trail design attempts to avoid the need for barriers and restrictions and instead seeks to bring trail layout and user desires in line with each other – both through physical design and through persuasive outreach to users.{{r|soft|page1=16}}

===Accommodation===
Landscapers sometimes accommodate desire paths by paving them and integrating them into the official path network rather than blocking them.&lt;ref name=Kohlstedt&gt;{{cite web |url=http://99percentinvisible.org/article/least-resistance-desire-paths-can-lead-better-design/ |title=Least Resistance: How Desire Paths Can Lead to Better Design |author=Kurt Kohlstedt |date=January 30, 2016 |work=99% Invisible |accessdate=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.vtnews.vt.edu/articles/2014/08/080514-vpa-drillfieldpaths.html |title=Dirt paths on Drillfield to be paved |author=Bob Spieldenner |date=August 5, 2014 |work=Virginia Tech News |accessdate=February 3, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases, land planners have deliberately left land fully or partially unpathed, waiting to see what desire paths are created, and then paving those.&lt;ref name=Kohlstedt/&gt; In Finland, planners are known to visit their parks immediately after the first snowfall, when the existing paths are not visible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.rbkc.gov.uk/idoxWAM/doc/Other-777167.pdf?extension=.pdf&amp;id=777167&amp;location=VOLUME2&amp;contentType=application/pdf&amp;pageCount=1 |title= Earls Court Project Application 1: The 21st Century High Street |date= June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; People naturally choose desire paths, clearly marked by their footprints, which can be then used to guide the routing of new purpose-built paths.
{{clear left}}

In other cases, access to desired paths may be blocked in an attempt to enforce use of official paths. Remedies applied may include fencing off desired paths, erection of signs forbidding the use of desired paths and re-vegetating well worn paths. [[File:Desired path in a park.jpg|thumb|A desired path is roped off for re-vegetation in [[Brisbane, Australia]]]]

==Other uses of the concept==
The image of a user-created path, in seeming defiance of authority, across the earth between the concrete, has captured the imagination of many as a metaphor for, variously, [[anarchism]], [[User experience design|intuitive design]], individual [[creativity]], or [[Wisdom of the crowd|the wisdom of crowds]].&lt;ref name=myhill&gt;{{citation|last1=Myhill|first1=Carl|editor1-last=Masodian|editor1-first=M|editor2-last=Jones|editor2-first=S|editor3-last=Rogers|editor3-first=B|title=6th Asia Pacific Computer-Human Interaction Conference (APCHI 2004)|date=2004|publisher=Springer-Verlag|location=Rotorua, New Zealand|chapter=Commercial Success by Looking for Desire Lines|url=http://www.litsl.com/personal/commercial_success_by_looking_for_desire_lines.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

In [[urban planning]], the concept of desire paths can be used when analyzing traffic patterns in any mode of travel. See, for example, its use in the 1959 Chicago Area Transportation Study to describe choices commuters made about railroad and subway trips.&lt;ref&gt;State of Illinois. (1959) [https://archive.org/stream/chicagoareatrans01chic#page/40/mode/2up "Chicago Area Transportation Study"] p. 40. State of Illinois, Springfield, IL. Retrieved 14 March 2012 from Paul V. Galvin Library, Illinois Institute of Technology.&lt;/ref&gt;

In software design, the term is used to describe the action of people widely adopting the same methods to overcome the limitations of the software they are using.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Malone|first1=Erin|last2=Crumlish|first2=Christian|title=Pave the Cowpaths|url=http://designingsocialinterfaces.com/patterns/Pave_the_Cowpaths|website=Designing Social Interfaces|accessdate=26 May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; A representative example is [[Twitter]], which has "paved" a number of desire paths by integrating them into the service, including @ mentions, [[hashtag]]s, and group discussions, although not always precisely mimicking the behaviors of users.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Honeycutt|first=C|last2=Herring|first2=S C|year=2009|title=Beyond Microblogging: Conversation and Collaboration via Twitter|url=http://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/4755499/?reload=true|journal=Proceedings of the 42nd Hawai’I International Conference on System Sciences|volume=|pages=|via=IEEE Xplore}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Draucker|first=Fawn|last2=Collister|first2=Lauren|date=2015-11-09|title=Managing Participation through Modal Affordances on Twitter|url=https://olh.openlibhums.org/articles/10.16995/olh.21/|journal=Open Library of Humanities|language=en|volume=1|issue=1|doi=10.16995/olh.21/|issn=2056-6700}} {{open access}} &lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Debar Lake in 1996.jpg|thumb|Reservoir on the Macedonian side (1986)]]
The '''Dibër valley''' ({{lang-mk|italic=yes|Debar}}, {{lang-tr|Debre}}) is a section of the [[Drin Valley|Drin]] valley in the border region between [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] and [[Albania]].

The high-altitude alley is surrounded by even higher mountains on all sides: to the north is the [[Korab]] range, containing [[Mount Korab]] which, at 2764 metres, is the highest point in both countries; the mountains on the other sides also exceed 2000 metres. The Black Drin flows from the south through a narrow canyon into the valley and leaves it through a similarly steep canyon. Previously the river was notorious for annual floods, as a result of which there are no settlements near the river itself.Since the construction of a reservoir on the Macedonian side, the [[Debar Lake]], the level of the river is regulated.

The Dibër valley is fertile. [[Wolf|Wolves]] and [[bear]]s are still found in the large forests of the valley. A large portion of the inhabitants work in agriculture. 

After the collapse of the [[Ottoman Empire]] in Europe, the European great powers established the borders of the new Balkan states at the [[London Conference of 1912–13]]. As a result, the Dibër valley was cut in half. The northwestern part, also known as the Little Dibër, was assigned to Albania. The Big Dibër, around the city of [[Debar]] (Albanian: Dibër), went to the [[Kingdom of Serbia]]. The city thus lost a large part of its hinterland. Families were separated and the inhabitants of the Albanian state were no longer able to visit the market in Debar. On the Albanian side, the city of [[Peshkopi]] became the new regional centre, the capital of the modern [[Dibër County]] and [[Dibër, Albania|Dibër municipality]].

The majority of Dibër's inhabitants are [[Albanians]], who speak a [[Gheg Albanian|Gheg dialect]] and are traditionally [[Muslim]]. There is a [[Macedonians (ethnic group)|Macedonian Slav]] minority on both sides of the border.

Duduma is about 92&amp;nbsp;km from [[Koraput]] and about 177&amp;nbsp;km  from Visakhapatnam. It forms a part of the boundary between Andhra Pradesh and Odisha.

Duduma Waterfalls is one of the highest waterfalls in India. Its waters support a large [[Hydroelectricity|hydroelectric]] project called Machkund Hydro Electric Power Project located at 'Onukudelli'. Machkund is an important place for [[pilgrimage]]. The name Machkund derived from a pilgrimage point called 'Matsya Kunda'near the township of Paderu in Andhra Pradesh. A beautiful township called 'Onukudelli' has grown around this lovely place. The aboriginal tribe of 'Bondas' live near this waterfalls. It has two sub-waterfalls one on the Odisha side and the other on the Andhra Pradesh side. The waterfalls lie in picturesque surroundings. It is one of the best tourist spots in Southern India.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2275">[[File:AT1304 map.png|thumb|Eritrean coastal desert ecoregion map]]
The '''Eritrean coastal desert''' [[ecoregion]] is a harsh sand and gravel strip along the southern part of the coast of [[Eritrea]] and the [[Red Sea]] coast of [[Djibouti]]. This coast is of ecological importance as a channel for the mass migration of birds of prey.

==Location and description==
The ecoregion consists of a coastal strip in Eritrea's [[Southern Red Sea Region]], which stretches along the Red Sea coast to [[Obock]] in Djibouti.

==Flora==
The flora of the coastal strip consists of herbs and grasses suited to the dry climate such as ''[[Aerva javanica]]'', ''[[Cymbopogon schoenanthus]]'', ''[[Panicum turgidum]]'', and ''[[Lasiurus scindicus]]'', along with some Umbrella thorn ''[[Acacia tortilis]]'' and ''[[Acacia asak]]'' trees and ''[[Rhigozum somalense]]'' and ''[[Caesalpinia erianthera]]''  shrubs.

==Fauna==
This is one of the busiest [[Bird of prey|raptor]] migration routes in the world as birds such as buzzards and eagles make  their way to Africa for the winter along the Red Sea coast and across the [[Bab-el-Mandeb]] strait.  Animals found here include sea turtles and gazelles including Dorcas gazelle ''([[Gazella dorcas]])'', Soemmerring’s gazelle ''([[Gazella soemmerringii]])'' and Salt’s dik-dik ''([[Madoqua saltiana]])''. There are three near-endemic reptiles Ogaden burrowing asp ''([[Atractaspis leucomelas]])'', Ragazzi's cylindrical skink ''([[Chalcides ragazzii]])'', and the gecko ''([[Hemidactylus flaviviridis]])''.

==Threats and preservation==
The coast is sparsely populated with the only town of any size the small port of [[Assab]] in Eritrea. Grazing of livestock has reduced the natural vegetation, there are no protected areas and there is potential for further change to the area with the completion of the planned coast road from Djibouti to Eritrea. Hunting of the gazelles, turtles and seabirds occurs.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3893">"'''''Frazione'''''" ({{IPA-it|fratˈtsjoːne}}; {{abbr|pl.|plural}} {{lang|it|frazioni}} {{IPA-it|fratˈtsjoːni|}}) is the Italian name given in administrative law to a type of territorial subdivision of a ''[[comune]]''; for other [[administrative division]]s, see ''[[municipio]]'', ''[[circoscrizione]]'', ''[[quartiere]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=https://findwords.info/term/frazione |title=Frazione - findwords.info |access-date=2017-08-26 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170826073108/https://findwords.info/term/frazione |archive-date=2017-08-26 |dead-url=no |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is [[cognate]] to the English word ''fraction'', but in practice is roughly equivalent to "[[parish (administrative division)|parish]]es" or "[[ward (country subdivision)|ward]]s" in other countries.

==Description==
Typically the term ''frazioni'' applies to the villages surrounding the principal town (the ''[[capoluogo]]'') of a ''comune''. Subdivision of a ''comune'' is optional; some ''comuni'' have no ''frazioni'', but others have several dozen. The ''comune'' usually has the same name of the ''capoluogo'', but not always.

In practice, most ''frazioni'' are small [[village]]s or [[Hamlet (place)|hamlet]]s, occasionally a clump of houses. Not every hamlet is classified as a ''frazione''; those that are not are often referred to as ''[[località]]'', for example, in the telephone book. On some occasions, ''frazioni'' can be more populated than the ''capoluogo'' of the ''comune''. Due to unusual circumstances or to the depopulation of the ''capoluogo'', the town hall and its administrative functions can move to one of the ''frazioni'': the ''comune'' still retains the name of the ''capoluogo''.

==History==
Historically, many ''frazioni'' came into being during the [[Fascism|Fascist]] era, when a major effort was made to consolidate and rationalize the territorial subdivisions of the country. Sometimes, a ''frazione'' represents a former ''comune'' that was believed to be no longer viable. 

Until 2000, the central government established the frazioni and defined their borders, except in the case of the five [[Autonomous area|autonomous regions]] (see [[Regions of Italy]]), where this was controlled at the [[region]]al level. By the Legislative Decree 267/2000 to implement amendments to Title V of the Italian Constitution, the individual ''comuni'' now define the ''frazioni'' within their borders.

==Countries using the term==
* {{flagicon|Italy}} [[Italy]]
* {{flagicon|San Marino}} [[San Marino]] (curazie)
* {{flagicon|Switzerland}} [[Switzerland]]

==Officers==
Under the former legislation, a ''frazione'' had the option of having a ''prosindaco'' (submayor), who was appointed by the [[mayor]] (''il sindaco'') of the ''comune'', often on the recommendation of deliberative bodies such as the communal council (''consiglio'') or the ''giunta'', or as a result of a petition by enough residents of the ''frazione'' involved; although there was no official provision for groups of ''frazioni'' joining forces with the appointment of a single ''prosindaco'', the case was frequent enough. Under current law, however, Article&amp;nbsp;54 of the d.lgs. 267/2000 provides that a mayor may delegate mayoral functions at the ''frazione'' level to a councillor of the ''comune''.

In many ''comuni'', in addition to their advisory function, the ''frazioni'' are endowed with their own clerks and recorders of deeds, but do not maintain their own civil records{{Fact|date=August 2015}}.

'''Fred Bowerman Kniffen''' (January 18, 1900 – May 19, 1993) was an American [[geographer]] and distinguished [[professor]] in the Department of Geography and Anthropology at [[Louisiana State University]] for over 64 years.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gritzner|first=Charles F.|year=1994|title=Fred B.

Kniffen became a distinguished professor in the department in 1966, later becoming Boyd professor in 1967.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Kniffen was born in [[Britton, Michigan]], on January 18, 1900.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Walker|first=H. Jesse|last2=Richardson|first2=Miles E.|year=1994|title=Fred Bowerman Kniffen, 1900–1993|journal=Annals of the Association of American Geographers|volume=84|issue=4|pages=732–743|doi=10.1111/j.1467-8306.1994.tb01892.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of his ancestors were of English descent. Kniffen's father had many jobs while he was growing up, some of which included a [[lumberjack]] and a [[brickmaker]]. His mother was a [[school teacher]] who encouraged him to excel in his studies and instilled in him a passion for learning.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; When Kniffen was six years old, his family moved to [[Coffeyville, Kansas]]. There, he excelled in school and was able to skip a grade.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; The family then moved to [[Superior, Wisconsin]] after Kniffen's first year of high school. Once he completed high school, Kniffen enlisted in the [[army]]. Once out of service, Kniffen enrolled at the Superior State Normal School, where he earned college credits for three semesters.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; While taking courses at the Superior State, Kniffen had a strong desire to earn a university degree. He ultimately ended up transferring to the [[University of Michigan]] in [[Ann Arbor, Michigan]]. Kniffen graduated with a [[Bachelor of Arts|Bachelor of Arts (B.A.)]] degree in [[geology]] in 1922.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; After graduation, he bounced around from job to job, some of which included a [[Pipefitter|pipe-fitter]] and a [[Storekeeper|store keeper]]. Kniffen developed an interest in [[geography]] (especially the human aspect) during his undergraduate years at the [[University of Michigan]] as a result of long conversations with [[Carl O. Sauer]]. Therefore, he enrolled at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] to study geography and [[anthropology]] under [[Carl O. Sauer]], [[Oskar Schmieder]], and [[Alfred L. Kroeber]].&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Mathewson|first=Kent|year=2009|title=Uncommon Groundings: Fred B. Kniffen's Place in Current Cultural Geography|journal=Journal of Cultural Geography|volume=15|pages=33–44|doi=10.1080/08873639409478363}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kniffen's doctoral research focused on the [[Colorado River Delta]]'s cultural and natural landscape.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; Kniffen graduated with his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.)]] degree in 1929.

== Career ==
Once Kniffen received his [[doctorate]] degree, he promptly took a position as an assistant professor at [[Louisiana State University]] in the fall of 1929.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; During this time, one of Kniffen's main job duties included formalizing the geography curriculum in the department in tandem with other colleagues. Kniffen's teaching load during his early years was very intense (15 – 20 hours per week), and included courses in [[Geology|forest geology]], [[mineralogy]], and a handful of courses in geography.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; In the beginning of Kniffen's career at Louisiana State University, the Departments of Geography and Anthropology were initially separate.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Role Of The South In The Making Of American Geography: Centennial Of The AAG, 2004|last=Wheeler|first=James O.|last2=Brum|first2=Stanley D.|publisher=Bellwether Publishing Ltd.|year=2004|isbn=978-0966586978|location=|pages=245–267}}&lt;/ref&gt; Kniffen was the head of the Department of Anthropology before the merge (of Geography and Anthropology). During this time, he taught courses in geography as well. Kniffen's courses were said to be rigorous, but widely popular with students.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was said to have a passion and enthusiasm for geography along with a very strong work ethic.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

In 1951, along with colleague Richard J. Russell, Kniffen introduced the culture region concept in geography with the publishing of ''Culture Worlds''.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books/about/Culture_Worlds_A_Regional_Geography_of_t.html?id=PWdEnQEACAAJ|title=Culture Worlds|last=Russell|first=Richard J.|last2=Kniffen|first2=Fred B.|publisher=Macmillan|year=1951|isbn=|location=New York, New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; This book remained standard in the discipline for over three decades. Kniffen emphasized cultural landscapes in many of his teaching styles. This was due in large part to his history at the [[University of California, Berkeley]] and his work with Carl O. Sauer, Oskar Schmieder, and Alfred L. Kroeber. Perhaps Kniffen's most widely recognized accomplishment and contribution to the discipline was in the topic of folk housing and folk geography.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vlach|first=John M.|year=1995|title=Fred B.

Some of which include the folk-ways of sport hunting, geographical myths of [[Louisiana]], and costumes of American working men.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; In addition to geography and anthropology, Kniffen conducted  [[Archaeology|archaeological]] research, especially in Louisiana.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Specifically, he conducted research on the geomorphic history of [[Bayou Manchac]]. There, he discovered three pottery assemblages, corresponding to varying time periods.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Lastly, Kniffen contributed greatly to the understanding of French Louisiana by encouraging his students to conduct theses and dissertations on the topic.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Comeaux|first=Malcolm|year=1994|title=Fred Kniffen's Contributions to Understanding French Louisiana|journal=Journal of Cultural Geography|volume=15|pages=59–66|doi=10.1080/08873639409478365}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Kniffen mentored seven [[Master of Science|Master of Science (M.S.)]] students, eight [[Master of Arts|Master of Arts (M.A.)]] students, and twenty-eight Doctor of Philosophy (Ph.D.) students during the period 1936 – 1970.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He was also committee chair on numerous undergraduate theses while at Louisiana State University.

==Death and legacy==
Kniffen died on May 19, 1993, at the age of 93 in [[Baton Rouge, Louisiana]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; He is survived by his wife, three sons, a daughter, five grandchildren, and five great-grandchildren.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; At the time of Kniffen's death, the flag on campus was flown at [[half-mast]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

A [[professorship]] was established in his name in 1991 entitled the "Fred B. Kniffen Professorship". In 1994, a wing of the Geosciences Building on Louisiana State University's campus was named the "Fred B. Kniffen" wing.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt; During the past sixty years, over thirty [[festschrift]]s, [[dedication]]s, and [[tribute]]s have been made in his honor.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

==Geological and Structural Units of Iran==
Considering geological and structural units of Iran, three main structural units or zones could be distinguished in Iran. These units or zones are separated from each other by [[ophiolite]]–bearing sutures. Other criteria such as structural style, crustal character and age of basement consolidation, age and intensity of deformation, age and nature of magmatism, are used to subdivide these major zones into smaller elements. The three major units and their main constituents could be defined as the southern, central and northern units.&lt;ref&gt;Geology of Iran, Geological Survey of Iran, www.gsi.ir&lt;/ref&gt; The southern unit has a crystalline basement consolidated in the [[Precambrian]] time and a [[platform (geology)|platform]]–type Paleozoic development and comprises the Zagros folded belt, southern and southwestern parts of the Zagros. This section made a part of the Arabian Plate that was located on the margin of [[Rodinia]] and [[Pannotia]] in the [[Neoproterozoic]], and of [[Gondwana]] in the [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]]. The central unit, which comprises the central Iran and the Alborz, is interpreted as an assemblage of fragments that were in the vicinity of the Arabian Plate and formed a marginal section of Rodinia and Pannotia in the Neoproterozoic and of Gondwana in the [[Cambrian]], [[Ordovician]], [[Silurian]] and [[Devonian]]. These fragments were detached from Gondwana in the [[Carboniferous]]. They were submerged, moved northwards, and were finally attached to the Eurasian section of the northern supercontinent [[Laurasia]] in the [[Late Triassic]]. These fragments or microplates were fused together and made the [[Iranian Plate]] which was rejoined by Gondwanic Afro-Arabia in the [[Late Cretaceous]]. As Afro-Arabia moved northwards towards [[Eurasia]], the [[Arabian Plate]] ultimately collided with the Iranian Plate in the [[Miocene]].&lt;ref&gt;Paleogeographic Maps, www.scotese.com&lt;/ref&gt; Finally there is the northern unit which is separated from the central unit by the North Iran Suture. It is characterized by continental crust including remnants of more or less cratonized former Paleozoic oceanic crust that seems to reflect the [[Paleotethys]]. The northern unit represents a marginal strip of the Hercynian realm of Central Asia- broadly overlapped by the Alpine realm. It was deformed and largely consolidated by the Early Cimmerian folding and the Late Alpine folding. The northern unit comprises the South Caspian Depression and the [[Kopet Dagh]] Range. These three main structural units are divided into some smaller geological and structural subdivisions which include the following zones:

===Zagros===
This zone extends from [[Bandar Abbas]] in the south to [[Kermanshah]] in the northwest and continues through to [[Iraq]]. Zagros is in fact the northeastern edge of the Arabian plate. Some important features of Zagros include: Absence of magmatic and metamorphic events after Triassic, and low abundance of the outcrops of [[Paleozoic]] rocks. Structurally, it consists of large [[anticline]]s and small [[syncline]]s and continuous marine sedimentation from the [[Carboniferous]] to the [[Miocene]]. On the whole, a sequence of [[Precambrian]] to [[Pliocene]] rocks about 8-10 kilometres in thickness has undergone folding from the Miocene to the [[Holocene|Recent]] time in the [[Zagros Mountains]]. The [[Zagros fold and thrust belt]] was formed by the collision of two tectonic plates — the [[Iranian Plate]] and the [[Arabian Plate]]. This collision primarily happened during the Miocene and folded the entire rocks that had been deposited from the Carboniferous to the Miocene in the [[geosyncline]] in front of the Iranian Plate. The process of collision continues to the present and as the Arabian Plate is being pushed against the Iranian Plate, the Zagros Mountains and the [[Iranian Plateau]] are getting higher and higher. The Zagros mountain range, itself, has a totally sedimentary origin and is made primarily of [[limestone]]. In the Elevated Zagros or the Higher Zagros, the Paleozoic rocks could be found mainly in the upper and higher sections of the peaks of the Zagros Mountains along the Zagros main fault. On the both sides of this fault, there are [[Mesozoic]] rocks, a combination of [[Triassic]] and [[Jurassic]] rocks that are surrounded by [[Cretaceous]] rocks on the both sides. The Folded Zagros (the mountains south of the Elevated Zagros and almost parallel to the main Zagros fault) is formed mainly of [[Tertiary]] rocks, with the [[Paleogene]] rocks south of the Cretaceous rocks and then the [[Neogene]] rocks south of the Paleogene rocks.&lt;ref&gt;Geology of Iran, Geological Survey of Iran, www.gsi.ir&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sanandaj–Sirjan===
This zone is located to the south-southwest of Central Iran and the northeastern edge of Zagros range. In the north and northeast, this zone is separated from Central Iran by depressions like [[Lake Orumiyeh]], [[Gavkhouni]] and faults like Shahr-e-Babak and Abadeh, and to the south-southwest by the main thrust fault of Zagros. A striking feature of this zone is the presence of immense volumes of magmatic and metamorphic rocks of [[Paleozoic]] and [[Mesozoic]] eras. As far as the trends, and particularly the folding style is concerned, some researchers consider the Sanandaj–Sirjan Zone as being similar to Zagros; however, considerable differences exist in rock types, magmatism, metamorphism, and orogenic events. There are some similarities between [[Sanandaj]]–[[Sirjan]] and Central Iran.&lt;ref&gt;GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF IRAN - Manuel berberian, www.manuelberberian.com/Berberian%201976%20-%20Report%2039.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Sahand–Bazman Volcanic Belt===
This volcanic belt, which is usually called the [[Central Iranian Range]], runs east and almost parallel to the Sanandaj–Sirjan Zone, and owes its existence to the widespread and intensive volcanic activity which developed on the Iranian plate from the [[Upper Cretaceous]] to [[Holocene|Recent]] time. The peak of this volcanism happened in the [[Eocene]]. The [[Sahand]]-[[Bazman]] volcanic belt is supposed to have resulted from the collision of the Arabian and Central Iranian continental plate margins. It is represented by sub-alkaline volcanics that vary in composition from basaltic through andesitic to rhyolitic composition.

===Central Iran===
Located in a triangle in the middle of Iran, Central Iran is one of the most important and complicated structural zones in Iran. In this zone, rocks of all ages, from [[Precambrian]] to [[Quaternary]], and several episodes of orogeny, [[metamorphism]], and [[magmatism]] can be recognized. Central Iran in a broad sense, comprising the whole area between the North and South Iranian ranges. Within the Iranian plate the Central-East Iran microplate is bordered by the Great Kavir Fault in the north, by the [[Nain, Iran|Nain]]–[[Baft]] Fault in the west and southwest and by the [[Harirud]] Fault in the east. It is surrounded by the Upper Cretaceous to Lower Eocene ophiolite and ophiolitic melange. The microplate consists of different structural components; [[Kerman]]-[[Tabas]] Block, [[Yazd]] Block and [[Anarak]]-[[Khur]] Block.

===Eastern Iran===
Eastern Iran can be divided into two parts: Lut Block and Flysch Zone ([[flysch]] or coloured melange of Zabol–Baluch Zone). Located to the west of Zabol–Baluch Zone, Lut Block is the main body of Eastern Iran. Lut Block extends for about 900&amp;nbsp;km in a north–south direction. It is bounded in the north by Dorooneh fault and in the south by Jazmurian depression. In the east, it is separated from Flysch Zone by the Nehbandan fault, whereas the western boundary with Central Iran is Nayband fault and Shotori Mountains. The oldest units include upper Precambrian Lower Cambrian schists overlain by [[Permian]] limestone and other Paleozoic sedimentary rocks. Flysch Zone (Zabol–Baluch) is located between Lut Block to the west and [[Helmand]] (in [[Afghanistan]]) to the east. In contrast to Lut Block, the Flysch Zone is highly deformed and tectonized and consists of thick deep-sea sediments like argillaceous and silicic [[shale]]s, [[radiolarite]], and pelagic limestone and volcanic rocks such as [[basalt]], spilitic basalt, [[diabase]], [[andesite]], [[dacite]], [[rhyolite]], and subordinate serpentinized ultramafic rocks. The basement is likely composed of an oceanic crust. Most rock units in this zone fall into three main groups: flyschoid sediments; volcanic, volcanosedimentary, and intrusive rocks; and ophiolitic series.

===Southeastern Iran or Makran===
Southeastern Iran or [[Makran]] zone is located to the south of [[Jazmurian District|Jazmurian]] depression. Its western boundary is [[Minab]] fault; to the south, it is restricted by the [[Gulf of Oman]], and to the east, it extends into [[Pakistan]]. The northern part is characterized by dominance of east–west trending faults, [[Bashagard]] fault being the most important one. Along these faults lies large section of ophiolite series. The oldest rocks in this zone are the ophiolites of Late Cretaceous–[[Paleocene]] overlain by a thick sequence (about 5,000 m) of [[sandstone]], shale, and [[marl]]. The whole sequence is deformed prior to Early Miocene. Thick sequence of [[Neogene]] rock units, in excess of 5,000 m, covers the older series.

===Kopet Dagh===
The northeastern active fold belt of Iran, the [[Kopet Dagh]], is formed on the Hercynian metamorphosed basement at the southwestern margin of the Turan Platform. The belt is composed of about 10 kilometres of Mesozoic and Tertiary sediments (mostly carbonates) and, like the Zagros, was folded into long linear northwest-southeast trending folds during the last phase of the Alpine Orogeny, in the Miocene and Plio-Pleistocene time. No magmatic rocks are exposed in Kopet Dagh except for those in the basement in the Aghdarband and some [[Triassic]] basic dikes. This basin was located in the northeastern Iran. From [[Middle Jurassic]], it was covered with a vast continental shelf sea. In this period of time and due to transgression as well as rapid subsidence basin, the western part became deeper. In this basin, a thick sequence of continuous marine and continental sediments was deposited (about 10&amp;nbsp;km). No major sedimentary gap or volcanic activities during [[Jurassic]] to [[Miocene]] have ever been reported. This sedimentary complex provides suitable conditions for accumulation of hydrocarbons. Kopet Dagh sedimentary rocks were placed in their current position due to uplifting at the end of the Miocene. The Kopet Dag Range, itself, is made chiefly of Cretaceous rocks with a smaller portion of Jurassic rocks in the southeastern parts. The mountains were mainly formed in the Miocene during the Alpine orogeny. As the [[Tethys Sea]] was closed and the Arabian Plate collided with the Iranian Plate and was pushed against it, and with the clockwise rotation of the Eurasian Plate towards the Iranian Plate and their final collision, the Iranian Plate was pressed against the Turan Platform. This collision folded the entire rocks that had been deposited in this [[geosyncline]] or basin from the Jurassic to the Miocene and formed the Kopet Dag Mountains.
  
===Alborz===
The [[Alborz]] mountain range forms a barrier between the south Caspian and the Iranian plateau. This range is located in northern Iran, parallel to the southern margin of [[Caspian Sea]]. Alborz is characterized by the dominance of platform-type sediments, including limestone, dolostone, and clastic rocks. Rock units from Precambrian to Quaternary have been identified, with some hiatuses and unconformities in Paleozoic and Mesozoic. Unlike its northern and southern boundaries, (Caspian Sea and Central Iran, respectively) there is not a consensus regarding the eastern and the western limits of Alborz. The [[Binalud Mountains]] in the east, although the continuation of the Alborz, bear features comparable to those of Central Iran. The Alborz mountain range is only 60–130&amp;nbsp;km wide and consists of sedimentary series dating from [[Upper Devonian]] to [[Oligocene]], prevalently Jurassic limestone over a [[granite]] core. Continental conditions regarding sedimentation are reflected by thick [[Devonian]] [[sandstone]]s and by Jurassic shales containing [[coal]] seams. Marine conditions are reflected by [[Carboniferous]] and [[Permian]] strata that are composed mainly of [[limestone]]s. In the Eastern Alborz Range, the far eastern section is formed by the [[Mesozoic]] (chiefly [[Triassic]] and [[Jurassic]]) rocks, while the western part of the Eastern Alborz Range is made primarily of the [[Paleozoic]] rocks. The [[Precambrian]] rocks can be found chiefly south of the city of [[Gorgan]] situated in the southeast of the Caspian Sea and in much smaller portions in the central and western parts of the Central Alborz Range. The central part of the Central Alborz Range is formed predominantly of the Triassic and Jurassic rocks, while the northwestern section of the range is made chiefly of Jurassic rocks. Very thick beds of the Tertiary (mostly of the [[Eocene]]) green volcanic [[tuff]]s and [[lava]]s are found mainly in the southwestern and south-central parts of the range. The far northwestern part of the Alborz that constitutes what is called the Western Alborz Range or the [[Talish Mountains]] is made mainly of the [[Upper Cretaceous]] volcano-sedimentary deposits with a strip of Paleozoic rocks and a band of Triassic and Jurassic rocks in the southern parts, both in a northwest-southeast direction. With the northward movement of Africa and the Arabian plate and with the closure of the [[Tethys Sea]] as the Arabian Plate collided with the Iranian Plate and was pushed against it, and with the clockwise movement of the Eurasian Plate towards the Iranian Plate and their final collision, the Iranian Plate was pressed from both sides. The collisions finally caused the folding of the Upper [[Paleozoic]], [[Mesozoic]], and [[Paleogene]] rocks, and the [[Cenozoic]] (chiefly the [[Eocene]]) [[volcanism]] to form the Alborz Mountains mainly in the Miocene. The [[Alpine orogeny]] began, therefore, with Eocene volcanism in southwestern and south-central parts of the Alborz and continued with the uplift and folding of the older sedimentary rocks in the northwestern, central and eastern parts of the range during the orogenic phases of importance that date from the [[Miocene]] and the [[Pliocene]] epochs.&lt;ref&gt;GEOLOGICAL SURVEY OF IRAN - Manuel berberian, www.manuelberberian.com/Berberian%201976%20-%20Report%2039.pdf.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Azerbaijan===
There is no agreement regarding the geological setting of [[Azerbaijan]]. According to some authors, the northeastern corner could be included in Alborz and the southeastern part in Sanandaj–Sirjan. Some believe that most of Azerbaijan lies in a zone called Azerbaijan–Alborz, and as they indicate, this zone is bounded in the north by Alborz fault, in the west by [[Tabriz]]–[[Urumiyeh]] fault, and in the south by [[Semnan, Iran|Semnan]] fault. According to the some authors, the northern part of Azerbaijan continues to the [[Caucasus Mountains]] in [[Caucasus|Caucasia]] and the [[Pontus Mountains]] in [[Turkey]] and the Southern Azerbaijan is comparable with Central Iran and Western Iran and extends to the [[Taurus Mountains]] in Turkey. The significant structural event occurring in Early [[Devonian]] was accompanied by faulting and fragmentation that led to a different sedimentary facies in Azerbaijan. This orogenic episode generated the Tabriz fault, extending in a northwest–southeast direction from [[Zanjan, Iran|Zanjan]] depression to the northern mountains of Tabriz (Mishu, Morou) and northwest of Azerbaijan and the Caucasus. This event divided Azerbaijan into two blocks, one block in the northeast with subsidence and sedimentation in Early Devonian and the other in the southwest which remained high until Late Carboniferous.&lt;ref&gt;A Summary of Geology of Iran - Springer, www.springer.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Stratigraphy of Iran==

===Precambrian===
The consolidation of the Iranian basement by [[metamorphism]], partial granitization and partly by intense folding took place in the Late Precambrian. This event has been attributed to the 'Baikalian' or Pan–African Orogeny by various authors. Isotopic data of Iranian basement rocks give ages between 600 and 900 Ma. A similar range of isotopic data had been obtained for Arabian Shield rocks. An important post-Pan-African [[magmatism]] is documented by the widespread Doran Granite, which cuts the Upper Precambrian rocks and is covered by Lower [[Cambrian]] sediments. Late Precambrian postorogenic volcanics, mainly alkali [[rhyolite]], rhyolite tuff and basic dikes are known in the Eocambrian formations. In North and Central Iran, Kahar and Gharehdash Formations and the lower half of the Soltanieh Formation are of [[Precambrian]] age. The oldest rocks in Iran belong to the Kushk Series consisting of clastic sediments, acidic volcanic, tuff, and carbonates (mainly [[dolomite]]). Other formations of Late Precambrian–Early Cambrian ages include Rizu volcanic-sedimentary Formation, Dezu and Tashk Formations, Aghda limestone, Kalmard Series, Shorm Beds, and Anarak metamorphic units. The sedimentary facies of Precambrian–Lower Cambrian rocks in Northern Iran is different from that of Central Iran.

===Paleozoic===
With the [[Pan-African orogeny]] and following this orogenic episode, shallow marine sediments formed in Late Vendian. The influence of the orogenic episode is evident at the base of the Vendian sediments. Deposition of shallow marine sediments covered large areas in Iran during [[Paleozoic]] (e.g., Alborz, East of Iran, Zagros). There is strong stratigraphic evidence that transition from Vendian to Lower Cambrian was a progressive one, without hiatuses; there is no evidence for any orogenic or epeirogenic movements in Iran at this time (e.g., south of Zanjan, Valiabad Chalus, Shahin Dezh). Early Cambrian started with an alternation of shale, phosphate-bearing limestone, and dolomite sitting conformably and transitionally over Vendian dolomites. Transition from Soltanieh Formation to Barut, Zaigoon, and Laloon Formations is very difficult to recognize in the field. Middle [[Cambrian]] is characterized by uplift and regression; however, a renewed progression at this time led to the deposition of Mila and [[Kuhbonan]] Formations, consisting of limestone, dolomite, and shale, over older units. These formations bear trilobites and brachiopods of Middle and Late Cambrian. In some areas, the Late Cambrian carbonate facies turns transitionally into Ordovician [[graptolite]] shales, known as Lashkarak Formation in [[Alborz]], Shirgasht Formation in Central Iran and Ilbeyk and [[Zardkuh]] Formations in Zagros. In Kalmard area, [[Ordovician]] sediments are sitting on the Vendian sediments through an angular unconformity. In Late Ordovician, most parts of Iran were affected by epeirogenic movements; this coincides with [[Caledonian orogeny]] in Europe and some other parts of the earth. The [[epeirogeny]] caused a distinct hiatus at the [[Ordovician]]–[[Silurian]] boundary. Where present, the [[Silurian]] rocks in Iran consist mainly of limestone, sandstone, shale and volcanic materials, known as Niur Formation in Central Iran. The Lower Devonian rocks have been reported from several localities in Central Iran (e.g., Tabas, Sourian, [[Kerman]], Zagros); however, they seem to be missing in Alborz and parts of Zagros. Upper [[Devonian]] is characterized by marine transgression, particularly in Alborz, that extends into Lower Carboniferous. With exception of [[Tabas]] area, no record of Middle [[Carboniferous]] marine deposits has yet been discovered in Iran. Upper Carboniferous deposits are not significantly present in Iran and have only been identified in several localities from index goniatites. After a general regression and a distinct hiatus in Upper Carboniferous, [[Permian]] marine transgression deposits cover most parts of Iran (e.g., Alborz, Zagros, Central Iran); The Permian sediments are represented by Dorood [[sandstone]]s, Ruteh and Nesen [[limestone]]s in Alborz.&lt;ref&gt;A Summary of Geology of Iran - Springer, www.springer.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mesozoic===
The Lower [[Triassic]] sediments in Iran are mainly of shallow marine or continental shelf nature (e.g., Doroud sandstones and Elika [[dolomite]]s in Alborz, Sorkh [[shale]]s and Shotori dolomites in Central Iran. A continuous Permian–Triassic sequence has been reported from several areas in Iran, including [[Jolfa, Iran (city)|Jolfa]] (northwest of Iran), [[Abadeh]] (Southern Central Iran), and Southern [[Urumiyeh]] (the continuation of the Taurus in Turkey), north of Kandovan and Southern [[Amol]]. Transition from Middle to Upper Triassic coincides with Early Cimmerian orogenic episode, which led to the segmentation of the sedimentary basin into three sub-basins: Zagros in the south and southwest, Alborz in the north, and Central Iran. The Lower Jurassic rocks conformably overlie the Upper Triassic units; so are the Early Cretaceous deposits over the Upper Jurassic strata (e.g., Zagros). In North and Central Iran, the Upper Triassic and Lower–Middle [[Jurassic]] sediments have a detrital nature, consisting mainly of shale and sandstone with thicknesses varying from a few meters to more than 3,000 m. The presence of plant remains and coal beds suggest a continental or lagoon environment for the deposits. The [[Cretaceous]] deposits, characterized by diverse sedimentary facies, are widespread all over Iran. In Late Cretaceous, tectonic movements related to the [[Laramide orogeny]] affects most parts of Iran, leading to uplift, folding, and faulting. This is a prelude to significant developments in the geological evolution of Iran.

===Cenozoic===
In Iran the [[Cenozoic]] begins with the Cretaceous–Paleocene boundary that is characterized by striking changes in sedimentary environments (e.g., Alborz, Central Iran). An unconformity has been reported from many locations in Iran. Both continuous and discontinuous transitions have been discovered between [[Paleocene]] and [[Eocene]] strata; as is the case with Eocene and [[Oligocene]] (e.g., Central Iran). The Oligocene and [[Miocene]] stages are characterized by rapid subsidence, deposition, and facies changes in both marine and continental sedimentary basins (e.g., [[Mahneshan]] and Halab south of [[Zanjan, Iran|Zanjan]]). Oligocene sediments in most parts of Iran are of shallow marine character, turning into marine facies in Upper Oligocene through Lower Miocene (e.g., [[Qom]]). The Middle–Upper Miocene sediments are mostly of continental nature. The [[Quaternary]] is the prominent feature of the plains of Iran.&lt;ref&gt;A Summary of Geology of Iran - Springer, www.springer.com&lt;/ref&gt;

==Magmatism and Igneous Rocks==
Magmatic rocks of all ages, from the [[Precambrian]] to the [[Quaternary]], are widespread in Iran (e.g., Doran granite, Zarigan–Narigan granite, Torghabeh granite, Ghaen granite, Chaghand [[gabbro]], Alvand granite, [[Natanz]] granite). A correlation exists between distribution of magmatic rocks and certain types of [[ore]] deposits (e.g., [[iron]] deposits in [[Bafq]] related to Zarigan–Narigan-type granites, Mazraeh [[copper]] deposits related to Sheyvar–Daghi granite, [[Sarcheshmeh]] [[Porphyry (geology)|porphyry]] deposit related to Sarcheshmeh porphyry body). Several episodes of [[magmatism|magmatic activity]] have been identified in Iran. These episodes could be described as:

===Upper Precambrian–Lower Cambrian===
Volcanic and [[plutonic rock]]s with an age of 630–530 million years have been reported from many localities in Iran, particularly in Central Iran and Azerbaijan. These magmatic rocks seem to be related to the Pan-African tectonic-magmatic episode. Most magmatic rocks of this time bear an alkaline nature. The following magmatic series can be attributed to this phase: Doran-type intrusions in Azerbaijan. Narigan and Zarigan-type intrusive bodies extend from [[Anarak]] to [[Bafq]] and [[Kuhbonan]]. [[Volcanic rock]]s, mostly of [[rhyolite]] composition, in Ghareh Dash, Azerbaijan. Volcanic rocks associated with Kushk Series in the Bafq area. Volcanic rocks of Rizu, Dezu, and Kushk Formations in Central Iran. Most [[Precambrian]] [[metamorphic rock]]s of [[greenschist]] or even [[amphibolite]] facies, such as in [[Takab]] and Anarak areas, seem to have originally been volcanic materials, either [[lava]] or [[pyroclastic rock]]s.

===Lower Paleozoic===
Magmatic rocks of this time have been reported from many areas in Iran. Examples include basaltic rocks of [[Shahrud]] and Khosh Yeilagh, andesitic-basaltic units of Niur Formation in Central Iran, and tuffaceous materials in the upper parts of Mila Formation in Eastern Iran.

===Upper Paleozoic===
Volcanic rocks of andesitic-basaltic composition accompany Upper Paleozoic sedimentary strata in many areas all over Iran. Basaltic rocks associated with Jeyrud Formation of Upper [[Devonian]] are a typical example. There is strong evidence for significant magmatic activities in Late Paleozoic–Early Mesozoic (Early Permian to Early Jurassic) in Iran. Examples include: Magmatic rocks in the Southern [[Sanandaj]]–[[Sirjan]] ([[granite]]s and [[gabbro]]s of Sirjan area) and volcanic rocks of [[Sonqor|Songhor]] Series in Northern Sanandaj–Sirjan. Ultramafic and mafic rocks and their metamorphosed equivalents could be observed in Eastern Iran (Fariman area), Taknar Series, [[Gorgan]] schists, and Shanderman mafic/ultramafic metamorphic series.

===Mesozoic===
The [[Mesozoic]] magmatic rocks are associated with [[Cimmerian]] and [[Laramide]] orogenic events that caused continental and oceanic rifting, followed by closures and collisions in vast areas of Iran (e.g., Sanandaj–Sirjan). The Mesozoic magmatic rocks can be divided into three groups: [[Volcanic rock]]s: These rocks occurred mainly as a result of extension or tension related to the continental rifting, or subduction of the developed oceanic [[lithosphere]] under the continental lithosphere (e.g., Central Alborz for continental rifting; [[Saghez]]-Sanandaj axis for subduction). [[Intrusive rock]]s: Many intrusive bodies of mafic to granitic composition, with ages varying from early Triassic to [[Late Cretaceous]], have been identified in Iran (e.g., [[Borujerd]]–Shamsabad axis). In Triassic–Jurassic, volcanic rocks predominated the [[plutonic rock]]s. They are mainly alkaline in nature and are more abundant in Sanandaj–Sirjan. In Jurassic–Cretaceous, intrusive rocks exceed volcanic rocks; a significant number of [[batholith]]s in Iran occurred at this time. Kolah Ghazi, [[Shir Kuh]], and Shah Kuh were formed by Jurassic granite; and [[Mount Alvand]] was made by [[Upper Cretaceous]]-[[Paleocene]] granite.&lt;ref&gt;Geological Map of Iran, National Geoscience Database of Iran, www.ngdir.ir&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cenozoic===
The [[Tertiary]] is of great concern in Iran because of the great volumes and highly diverse types of [[igneous rock]]s and associated mineral deposits. [[Magmatic rock]]s of this age are widespread all over Iran, except in the [[Zagros]] and [[Kopet Dagh]]. Data from various structural zones indicate that the volcanic and plutonic activities started in the [[Late Cretaceous]], peaked in the [[Eocene]], and continued, with short stops, into the [[Quaternary]]. Some of the more important regions in terms of the Tertiary magmatic activities include: [[Sahand]]-[[Bazman]] (or Urumiyeh-Dokhtar) volcanic-plutonic belt with a series of famous mountain ranges including the [[Karkas Mountains]] and [[Jebal Barez]] and important peaks such as Karkas, [[Mount Marshenan|Marshenan]], [[Mount Hezar|Hezar]] and [[Mount Lalehzar|Lalehzar]]. The Tertiary magmatism could also be observed in [[Azerbaijan]], [[Tarom]]–[[Taleghan]], Central Alborz and its southern margins, Kavir–[[Sabzevar]], [[Kashmar]]–[[Torbat-e Jam]], Lut and Kavir, Central Iran, [[Sistan]], [[Bam, Iran|Bam]], Bazman, Taftan, East Iran, and Southern [[Jazmurian District|Jazmurian]]–[[Sabzevaran]]. The Quaternary [[volcanism]] produced very high peaks such as [[Sahand]], [[Sabalan]], [[Damavand]], [[Taftan Volcano|Taftan]], [[Bazman]] and many others.&lt;ref&gt;Map showing geology, oil and gas field, and geologic provinces of Iran

==Ophiolite Series and Ultramafic Rocks==
[[Ophiolite]] series and [[ultramafic rock]]s have a widespread occurrence in Iran and can be grouped as follows: Ultramafic and mafic units of Late Precambrian–Early Cambrian. Although comparable to modern ophiolites, these rocks do not display all typical features of an oceanic crust. The term “old ophiolite” might be a misnomer. These rocks are widespread in [[Takab]] and [[Anarak]] Regions. They might be representing a protorift. Ultramafic and [[mafic rock]]s of Upper Paleozoic occur as metamorphosed as well as non-metamorphosed bodies in some areas like [[Fariman]], Shanderman, and Asalem. These rocks display many typical features of modern ophiolites. Ophiolite series of [[Early Cretaceous]]–[[Paleogene]] age show typical features of ophiolitic sequences and are thought to be associated with the closure of the [[Neotethys]]. These ophiolite series are widespread in Iran. Some of the more important locations include [[Kermanshah]]–[[Neyriz]]–[[Oman]] Belt, [[Makran]] (south of Jazmurian), ultramafic–mafic rocks related to Flysch Zone in [[Khash, Iran|Khash]]–Nosrat Abad–[[Birjand]] Belt, ultramafic and mafic rocks north of Dorooneh fault, [[Torbat-e Jam]]–[[Torbat-e Heydarieh]]–[[Sabzevar]]–[[Fariman]] regions, and Central Iran–Nain–Baft–[[Shahr-e Babak]], [[Khoy]]–[[Maku, Iran|Maku]]. Ultramafic and mafic rocks also occur in association with large gabbroic intrusions. This type probably resulted from differentiation in a large mafic magma chamber, comparable to those of the layered mafic intrusions. Examples occur in Sero, [[Urumiyeh]], and in [[Masooleh]] that are [[Late Cretaceous]] to Lower [[Oligocene]] in age. The most remarkable occurrence of ophiolite could be observed in the [[Bashagard Mountains]] in the southeast and the [[Jaghatai Mountains]] in the northeast of Iran.&lt;ref&gt;Geological Map of Iran, National Geoscience Database of Iran, www.ngdir.ir&lt;/ref&gt;

==Orogenic Events in Iran==

===Pan-African===
The [[Pan-African orogeny]] is equivalent to Asynitic in other parts of the earth. This event was associated with [[metamorphism]], [[magmatism]], folding, and faulting during Late Precambrian–Early Cambrian in Iran (e.g., south of [[Zanjan, Iran|Zanjan]]–[[Mahabad]] in [[Azerbaijan]], [[Bafq]] in Central Iran. This tectonic phase started with tension or extension leading to the formation of rifts and generation of oceanic crust (e.g., in Takab and Anarak) and ended with folding, closure, metamorphism, growth of the continental crust, and development of regional faults.

===Caledonian===
There was no considerable folding or faulting related to this event in Iran. The [[Caledonian orogeny]] in Iran is characterized by facies change in sedimentary basins, hiatuses, and epeirogenic movements (e.g., parts of Alborz, Zagros, and Central Iran). This phase, starting from Late [[Cambrian]], caused the marine facies of Barut and Zaigoon Formations to change into the continental facies of Lalun Formation, and continued on to [[Late Devonian]].

===Hercynian===
The effects of this orogenic episode in Iran can be traced from the Late Devonian. Due to the scarcity of magmatism, metamorphism, and folding related to this episode, the role of the [[Hercynian orogeny]] in Iran is controversial; the Hercynian in Iran is largely represented by extensional rather than compressional tectonics (e.g., Sanandaj–Sirjan). Iranian microplates east and northeast of the Zagros were detached from [[Gondwana]] in the [[Carboniferous]] during this orogenic phase.

===Early Cimmerian===
The Early [[Cimmerian orogeny]] is one of the most important tectonic events in the geological history of the earth. Many diverse features are associated with this phase, including [[metamorphism]], [[magmatism]], folding, faulting, creation of new basins, and facies change. This event was associated with compressional [[tectonics]] in the northern Iran and tensional tectonics in the south. There is evidence that the compressional phase was preceded by tension and rift development. The compressional phase, happening in the [[Late Triassic]], finally led to the closure of the [[Paleotethys]] (e.g., southeast to southwest of [[Caspian Sea]]). Iranian microplates that had been detached from [[Gondwana]] in the [[Carboniferous]] and that had been submerged and had moved northwards toward [[Laurasia]] finally collided with the [[Eurasia]]n section of the northern supercontinent Laurasia in the Late Triassic.&lt;ref&gt;Paleogeographic Maps, www.scotese.com&lt;/ref&gt;

===Late Cimmerian===
The Late Cimmerian orogeny occurred as a significant tectonic event in Iran in Late Jurassic–Early Cretaceous times. This event is represented by folding, facies changes in sedimentary environments, angular unconformity, magmatism, and metamorphism (e.g., Alborz, Sanandaj–Sirjan, and Central Iran). The [[Jurassic]] [[granite]] of Kolah Ghazi, Shir Kuh, and Shah Kuh was made during this orogenic phase.&lt;ref&gt;Map showing geology, oil and gas field, and geologic provinces of Iran pubs.usgs.gov/of/1997/ofr-97-470/OF97-470G/Iranmap.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laramide===
The [[Laramide orogeny]] happened in the [[Late Cretaceous]]–[[Paleocene]] and played a great role in the geological evolution of Iran. This event started under a compressional regime, followed by an extensional one. The compressional regime, that was associated with significant intrusive magmatic activities, led to the closure of the oceanic basins and Neothetyan rifts. In some areas, slices of the oceanic crust have obducted onto the continental margins producing what could be called ophiolite assemblages or coloured melanges (e.g., mostly seen suture zone between Sanandaj–Sirjan and Zagros, and alongside [[Nehbandan]] fault in the east of Iran). The [[Upper Cretaceous]]-[[Paleocene]] granite of [[Mount Alvand]] was formed during the Laramide orogeny.&lt;ref&gt;Geological Map of Iran, National Geoscience Database of Iran, www.ngdir.ir&lt;/ref&gt;

===Alpine (Pyrenean and Styrian)===
With regards to the geological evidence, this event was of compressional nature. This tectonic phase is represented by significant changes in the sedimentary environments, [[plutonism]], and [[metamorphism]] (e.g., west of Central Iran, south of Central Alborz, Lut). The [[Sahand]]-[[Bazman]] volcanic arc or belt was mainly formed during the [[Eocene]] [[volcanism]] of the [[Alpine orogeny]]. The northern movement and the final collision of Afro-Arabia (significantly the Arabian Plate) with the [[Iranian Plate]] and the clockwise rotation of the [[Eurasian Plate]] towards the Iranian Plate caused the Alpine orogeny with the Pyrenean phase in the Late [[Eocene]]- Early [[Oligocene]] and the Styrian phase in the Middle [[Miocene]] respectively. The [[Zagros]], [[Alborz]], and [[Kopet-Dagh]] mountains were mainly formed in the Miocene during this orogenic phase.&lt;ref&gt;Geological Map of Iran, National Geoscience Database of Iran, www.ngdir.ir&lt;/ref&gt;

===Pasadenian===
This orogenic phase began in the Late [[Pliocene]] and continued in the [[Pleistocene]]. The Pasadenian orogeny is the most important phase in forging the current shape of Iran. Some younger orogenic events might be the continuation of this orogenic phase (e.g., Alborz–Azerbaijan axis, Zagros, Central Iran). [[Sahand]], [[Sabalan]], [[Damavand]], [[Bazman]] and [[Taftan Volcano|Taftan]] were mainly formed during the [[volcanism]] of this orogenic phase.&lt;ref&gt;Geological Map of Iran, National Geoscience Database of Iran, www.ngdir.ir&lt;/ref&gt; With an elevation of 5,610 metres, [[Mount Damavand]] is the highest peak in Iran. This volcano first erupted in the [[Pleistocene]] about 1.78 million years ago and after several known eruptions around 600,000 and 280,000 years ago, it finally erupted in the [[Holocene]] almost 7300 years ago.

'''Geopolitics''' (from [[Ancient Greek|Greek]] γῆ ''gê'' "earth, land" and πολιτική ''politikḗ'' "politics") is the study of the effects of [[geography]] (human and physical) on [[politics]] and [[international relations]].&lt;ref&gt;Devetak et al. (eds), ''An Introduction to International Relations'', 2012, p. 492.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Overland|first=Indra|date=2015|title=Future Petroleum Geopolitics: Consequences of Climate Policy and Unconventional Oil and Gas|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/281774890_Future_Petroleum_Geopolitics_Consequences_of_Climate_Policy_and_Unconventional_Oil_and_Gas|journal=|volume=|pages=3517–3544|doi=10.1002/9781118991978.hces203|via=Researchgate}}&lt;/ref&gt; While geopolitics usually refers to [[Country|countries]] and relations between them, it may also focus on two other kinds of [[state (polity)|state]]s: ''[[de facto|de&amp;nbsp;facto]]'' independent states with [[List of states with limited recognition|limited international recognition]] and; relations between [[administrative division|sub-national geopolitical entities]], such as the [[federated state]]s that make up a [[federation]], [[confederation]] or a quasi-federal system.

At the level of international relations, geopolitics is a method of studying [[foreign policy]] to understand, explain and predict international political behavior through geographical variables. These include [[area studies]], [[climate]], [[topography]], [[demography]], [[natural resources]], and [[applied science]] of the [[region]] being evaluated.&lt;ref&gt;Evans, G &amp; Newnham, J., (1998), "The Penguin Dictionary of International relations", Penguin Books, London, UK. {{ISBN|0-14-051397-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Geopolitics focuses on [[political power]] linked to geographic space. In particular, [[territorial waters]] and [[List of sovereign states|land territory]] in correlation with [[diplomatic history]]. Outside academia, a variety of groups offer geopolitical analysis, including non-profit groups and for-profit private institutions (such as brokerage houses&lt;ref name="financeExample"&gt;Fidelity. [https://www.fidelity.com/viewpoints/investing-ideas/2015-outlook-for-stocks "2015 Stock Market Outlook"], a sample outlook report by a brokerage house.&lt;/ref&gt; and consulting companies&lt;ref name="mckinseyExample"&gt;McKinsey Insights &amp; Publications. [http://www.mckinsey.com/insights "Insights &amp; Publications"].&lt;/ref&gt;). Topics of geopolitics include relations between the interests of international political actors and interests focused within an area, a space, or a geographical element; relations which create a geopolitical system.&lt;ref&gt;Vladimir Toncea, 2006, "Geopolitical evolution of borders in Danube Basin"&lt;/ref&gt; "[[Critical geopolitics]]" deconstructs classical geopolitical theories, by showing their political/ideological functions for [[great powers]].&lt;ref&gt;Mehmet Akif Okur, "Classical Texts Of the Geopolitics and the "Heart Of Eurasia", Journal of Turkish World Studies, XIV/2, pp.76-90 https://www.academia.edu/10035574/CLASSICAL_TEXTS_OF_THE_GEOPOLITICS_AND_THE_HEART_OF_EURASIA_Jeopoliti%C4%9Fin_Klasik_Metinleri_ve_Avrasya_n%C4%B1n_Kalbi_ http://tdid.ege.edu.tr/files/dergi_14_2/mehmet_akif_okur.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Christopher Gogwilt and other researchers, the term is currently being used to describe a broad spectrum of concepts, in a general sense used as "a synonym for international political relations", but more specifically "to imply the global structure of such relations", which builds on "early-twentieth-century term for a [[pseudoscience]] of [[political geography]]" and other [[pseudo science|pseudoscientific]] theories of [[historical determinism|historical]] and [[geographic determinism]].&lt;ref name="Gogwilt"&gt;{{cite book|url=http://www.sup.org/books/extra/?id=631&amp;isbn=0804737312&amp;gvp=1|title=The Fiction of Geopolitics|author=Gogwilt|first=Christopher|publisher=Stanford University Press|year=2000|isbn=978-0804737319|location=|pages=1|accessdate=2016-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=Geopolitics: An Introductory Reader | author=Jason Dittmer, Jo Shar | year=2014 | location=Routledge | page=64}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.unice.fr/crookall-cours/iup_geopoli/docs/geo-geopolitics-as-theory-ejir-deudney.pdf|title=Geopolitics as Theory: Historical Security Materialism|last=Deudney|first=Daniel|date=|website=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;

Oil and international competition over oil and gas resources was one of the main foci of the geopolitics literature from World War and onward.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt; From about 2010, a new branch of the literature emerged, focusing on international power relations related to renewable energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317954274_The_Geopolitics_of_Renewable_Energy|title=The Geopolitics of Renewable Energy|last=Overland|first=Indra|last2=O'Sullivan|first2=Meghan|last3=Sandalow|first3=David|last4=Vakulchuk|first4=Roman|last5=Lemphers|first5=Nathan|last6=Begg|first6=Harry|last7=Behrens|first7=Arno|last8=Bhatiya|first8=Neil|last9=Clark|first9=Alex|date=2017-06-30|publisher=Harvard University|year=2017|isbn=|location=https://www.researchgate.net/publication/317954274_The_Geopolitics_of_Renewable_Energy|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Alfred Thayer Mahan and sea power ===

[[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] (1840–1914), a frequent commentator on world naval strategic and diplomatic affairs, believed that national greatness was inextricably associated with the sea—and particularly with its commercial use in peace and its control in war. Mahan's theoretical framework came from [[Antoine-Henri Jomini]], and emphasized that strategic locations (such as [[choke point|chokepoints]], canals, and coaling stations), as well as quantifiable levels of fighting power in a fleet, were conducive to control over the sea. He proposed six conditions required for a nation to have [[sea power]]:

#Advantageous geographical position;
#Serviceable coastlines, abundant natural resources, and favorable climate;
#Extent of territory
#Population large enough to defend its territory;
#Society with an aptitude for the sea and commercial enterprise; and
#Government with the influence and inclination to dominate the sea.&lt;ref&gt;[http://compass.seacadets.org/pdf/nrtc/bmr/14325_ch20.pdf Sea Power] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100331010905/http://compass.seacadets.org/pdf/nrtc/bmr/14325_ch20.pdf |date=March 31, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mahan distinguished a key region of the world in the Eurasian context, namely, the Central Zone of Asia lying between 30° and 40° north and stretching from Asia Minor to Japan.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Thayer Mahan, ''The Problem of Asia and the Effects upon International Politics'', (Washington and London: Kennikat Press, 1920, p 26-27).&lt;/ref&gt; In this zone independent countries still survived – Turkey, Persia, Afghanistan, China, and Japan. Mahan regarded those countries, located between Britain and Russia, as if between "Scylla and Charybdis". Of the two monsters – Britain and Russia – it was the latter that Mahan considered more threatening to the fate of Central Asia. Mahan was impressed by Russia's transcontinental size and strategically favorable position for southward expansion. Therefore, he found it necessary for the Anglo-Saxon "sea power" to resist Russia.&lt;ref&gt;Alfred Thayer Mahan, ''The Problem of Asia and the Effects upon International Politics'', (Washington and London: Kennikat Press, 1920, p 25-27, 167-8, 172).&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Emil Reich ===
The Austro-Hungarian historian [[Emil Reich]] (1854–1910) is considered to be the first having coined the acceptance&lt;!-- error? --&gt; in English&lt;ref&gt;Christopher Lloyd GoGwilt, "The Geopolitical Image: Imperialism, Anarchism, and the Hypothesis of Culture in the Formation of Geopolitics", Modernism/modernity, Volume 5, Number 3, September 1998, pp.&amp;nbsp;49–70 et The Fiction of Geopolitics: Afterimages of Culture, from Wilkie Collins to Alfred Hitchcock. Stanford. Stanford University Press, 2000, pp.&amp;nbsp;35–36.&lt;/ref&gt; as early as 1902 and later in 1904 in his book ''Foundations of Modern Europe''.&lt;ref&gt;Foundations of Modern Europe, London, George Bell, 1904, 284 pages&lt;/ref&gt;

===Homer Lea===
[[Homer Lea]] in ''The Day of the Saxon'' (1912) described that the entire Anglo-Saxon race faced a threat from German (Teuton), Russian (Slav), and Japanese expansionism: The "fatal" relationship of Russia, Japan, and Germany "has now assumed through the urgency of natural forces a coalition directed against the survival of Saxon supremacy." It is "a dreadful Dreibund".&lt;ref&gt;''The Day of the Saxon'', (New York &amp; London: Harper and Brothers, 1912, p 122).&lt;/ref&gt; Lea believed that while Japan moved against Far East and Russia against India, the Germans would strike at England, the center of the British Empire.  He thought the Anglo-Saxons faced certain disaster from their militant opponents.

=== Mackinder and the Heartland theory ===
[[File:Pivot area.png|thumb|upright=2.05|Sir Halford Mackinder's Heartland concept showing the situation of the "pivot area" established in the [[Theory of the Heartland]]. He later revised it to mark Northern Eurasia as a pivot while keeping area marked above as Heartland.]]

[[Sir Halford Mackinder]]'s [[The Geographical Pivot of History|Heartland Theory]] initially received little attention outside geography, but some thinkers would claim that it subsequently influenced the [[foreign policy|foreign policies]] of world powers.&lt;ref&gt;Sloan, G.R. "Sir Halford Mackinder: the heartland theory then and now", in Gray C S and Sloan G.R., Geopolitics, geography and strategy. London: Frank Cass, pp. 15–38.&lt;/ref&gt; Those scholars who look to MacKinder through critical lenses accept him as an organic strategist who tried to build a foreign policy vision for Britain with his Eurocentric analysis of historical geography.&lt;ref&gt;Mehmet Akif Okur, "Classical Texts Of the Geopolitics and the "Heart Of Eurasia", Journal of Turkish World Studies, XIV/2, pp.75-80 https://www.academia.edu/10035574/CLASSICAL_TEXTS_OF_THE_GEOPOLITICS_AND_THE_HEART_OF_EURASIA_Jeopoliti%C4%9Fin_Klasik_Metinleri_ve_Avrasya_n%C4%B1n_Kalbi_ http://tdid.ege.edu.tr/files/dergi_14_2/mehmet_akif_okur.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; His formulation of the Heartland Theory was set out in his article entitled "[[The Geographical Pivot of History]]", published in [[England]] in 1904. Mackinder's doctrine of geopolitics involved concepts diametrically opposed to the notion of [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]] about the significance of navies (he coined the term ''sea power'') in world conflict. He saw navy as a basis of Colombian era empire (roughly from 1492 to the 19th century), and predicted the 20th century to be domain of land power. The Heartland theory hypothesized a huge empire being brought into existence in the Heartland—which wouldn't need to use coastal or transoceanic transport to remain coherent. The basic notions of Mackinder's doctrine involve considering the geography of the [[Earth]] as being divided into two sections: the [[Afro-Eurasia|World Island]] or Core, comprising [[Eurasia]] and [[Africa]]; and the Peripheral "islands", including the [[Americas]], [[Australia]], [[Japan]], the [[British Isles]], and [[Oceania]]. Not only was the Periphery noticeably smaller than the World Island, it necessarily required much sea transport to function at the technological level of the World Island—which contained sufficient natural resources for a developed economy.

Mackinder posited that the industrial centers of the Periphery were necessarily located in widely separated locations. The World Island could send its navy to destroy each one of them in turn, and could locate its own industries in a region further inland than the Periphery (so they would have a longer struggle reaching them, and would face a well-stocked industrial bastion). Mackinder called this region the ''Heartland''. It essentially comprised [[Central and Eastern Europe]]: [[Ukraine]], Western [[Russia]], and [[Mitteleuropa]].&lt;ref&gt;See map in Polelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hp1-oyQjqTgC&amp;lpg=PA57&amp;hl=cs&amp;pg=PA57#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Raising Cartographic Consciousness], p. 57.&lt;/ref&gt; The Heartland contained the grain reserves of Ukraine, and many other natural resources. Mackinder's notion of geopolitics was summed up when he said:

{{blockquote|Who rules Central and Eastern Europe commands the Heartland. Who rules the Heartland commands the World-Island. Who rules the World-Island commands the World.}}

[[Nicholas J. Spykman]] is both a follower and critic of geostrategists [[Alfred Mahan]], and [[Halford Mackinder]]. His work is based on assumptions similar to Mackinder's,&lt;ref&gt;Mehmet Akif Okur, "Classical Texts Of the Geopolitics and the "Heart Of Eurasia", Journal of Turkish World Studies, XIV/2, pp.81-83 https://www.academia.edu/10035574/CLASSICAL_TEXTS_OF_THE_GEOPOLITICS_AND_THE_HEART_OF_EURASIA_Jeopoliti%C4%9Fin_Klasik_Metinleri_ve_Avrasya_n%C4%B1n_Kalbi_ http://tdid.ege.edu.tr/files/dergi_14_2/mehmet_akif_okur.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; including the unity of world politics and the world sea. He extends this to include the unity of the air. Spykman adopts Mackinder's divisions of the world, renaming some:
#The [[Theory of the Heartland|Heartland]];
#The [[Rimland]] (analogous to Mackinder's "inner or marginal crescent" also an intermediate region, lying between the Heartland and the marginal sea powers); and
#The Offshore Islands &amp; Continents (Mackinder's "outer or insular crescent").&lt;ref&gt;See map in Polelle, [https://books.google.com/books?id=hp1-oyQjqTgC&amp;lpg=PA118&amp;hl=cs&amp;pg=PA118#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false Raising Cartographic Consciousness], p. 118.&lt;/ref&gt;

Under Spykman's theory, a Rimland separates the Heartland from ports that are usable throughout the year (that is, not frozen up during winter). Spykman suggested this required that attempts by Heartland nations (particularly [[Russia]]) to conquer ports in the Rimland must be prevented. Spykman modified Mackinder's formula on the relationship between the Heartland and the Rimland (or the inner crescent), claiming that "Who controls the rimland rules Eurasia.  Who rules Eurasia controls the destinies of the world." This theory can be traced in the origins of [[Containment]], a [[United States|U.S.]] policy on preventing the spread of Soviet influence after World War II (see also [[Truman Doctrine]]).

Another famous follower of Mackinder was [[Karl Haushofer]] who called Mackinder's [[Geographical Pivot of History]] a "genius' scientific tractate."&lt;ref&gt;[[Karl Haushofer]], ''Pan-Ideas in Geopolitics'', 1931, (tr. Usachev I. G., Mysl', Moscow, 2004, p 312).&lt;/ref&gt; He commented on it: "Never have I seen anything greater than those few pages of geopolitical masterwork."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Heffernan, ''The Meaning of Europe: Geography and Geopolitics'', (London &amp; New York: Arnold, 1998, p 134).&lt;/ref&gt; Mackinder located his Pivot, in the words of Haushofer, on "one of the first solid, geopolitically and geographically irreproachable maps, presented to one of the earliest scientific forums of the planet – the Royal Geographic Society in London"&lt;ref&gt;Karl Haushofer, "Pan-Ideas in Geopolitics", 1931, (tr. Usachev I. G., Mysl', Moscow, 2004, p 312).&lt;/ref&gt; Haushofer adopted both Mackinder's Heartland thesis and his view of the Russian-German alliance – powers that Mackinder saw as the major contenders for control of Eurasia in the twentieth century. Following Mackinder he suggested an alliance with the Soviet Union and, advancing a step beyond Mackinder, added Japan to his design of the ''Eurasian Bloc.''&lt;ref&gt;Karl Haushofer, "The Continental Bloc: Mittel Europa – Eurasia – Japan," 1941, (tr.
Usachev I. G., Mysl', Moscow, 2004).&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, at the centenary of [[The Geographical Pivot of History]], famous Historian [[Paul Kennedy]] wrote: "Right now with hundreds of thousands of US troops in the Eurasian rimlands and with administration constantly explaining why it has to stay the course, it looks as if Washington is taking seriously Mackinder's injunction to ensure control of the geographical pivot of history."&lt;ref&gt;cited in Klaus Dodds &amp; James Sidaway, "Halford Mackinder and the 'Geographical Pivot of History': a Centennial Retrospective," ''Geographical Journal'', 170/4, (2004): p 292.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Kissinger, Brzezinski and the Grand Chessboard ===
[[File:Хартленд и Римленд.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|left|World map with the concepts of Heartland and Rimland applied]]
Two famous [[National Security Advisor (United States)|Security Advisers]] from the Cold War period, [[Henry Kissinger]] and [[Zbigniew Brzezinski]], argued to continue the United States geopolitical focus on Eurasia and, particularly on Russia, despite the [[fall of Communism| dissolution of the USSR]] and the end of the [[Cold War]]. Both continued their influence on geopolitics after the end of the Cold War,&lt;ref&gt;Mehmet Akif Okur, "Classical Texts Of the Geopolitics and the "Heart Of Eurasia", Journal of Turkish World Studies, XIV/2, pp.83-85 https://www.academia.edu/10035574/CLASSICAL_TEXTS_OF_THE_GEOPOLITICS_AND_THE_HEART_OF_EURASIA_Jeopoliti%C4%9Fin_Klasik_Metinleri_ve_Avrasya_n%C4%B1n_Kalbi_ http://tdid.ege.edu.tr/files/dergi_14_2/mehmet_akif_okur.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; writing books on the subject in the 1990s—''[[Diplomacy (book)|Diplomacy (Kissinger 1994)]]'' and ''[[The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives]]''.&lt;ref&gt;(Perseus Books, New York, 1997)&lt;/ref&gt; The Anglo-American classical geopolitical theories were revived.

Kissinger argued against the approach that with the dissolution of the USSR hostile intentions had disappeared and traditional foreign policy considerations no longer applied. "They would argue … that Russia, regardless of who govern it, sits astride the territory Halford Mackinder called the geopolitical heartland, and is the heir to one of the most potent imperial traditions." Therefore the United States must "maintain the global balance of power vis-à-vis the country with a long history of expansionism."&lt;ref&gt;Kissinger, Henry, (1994). Diplomacy, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, p. 814&lt;/ref&gt;

After Russia, the second geopolitical threat remained Germany and, as Mackinder had feared ninety years ago, its partnership with Russia. During the Cold War, Kissinger argues, both sides of the Atlantic recognized that, "unless America is organically involved in Europe, it would be obliged to involve itself later under circumstances far less favorable to both sides of the Atlantic. That is even more true today. Germany has become so strong that existing European institutions cannot by themselves strike a balance between Germany and its European partners. Nor can Europe, even with Germany, manage by itself […] Russia." Thus Kissinger belied it is in no country's interest that Germany and Russia should fixate on each other as a principal partner. They would raise fears of condominium.{{clarify|date=September 2016}} Without America, Britain and France cannot cope with Germany and Russia; and "without Europe, America could turn … into an island off the shores of Eurasia."&lt;ref&gt;Kissinger, Henry, (1994). Diplomacy, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, p. 821-2&lt;/ref&gt;

Spykman's vision of Eurasia was strongly confirmed: "Geopolitically, America is an island off the shores of the large landmass of Eurasia, whose resources and population far exceed those of the United States. The domination by a single power of either of Eurasia's two principal spheres—Europe and Asia—remains a good definition of strategic danger for America. Cold War or no Cold War. For such a grouping would have the capacity to outstrip America economically and, in the end, militarily. That danger would have to be resisted even were the dominant power apparently benevolent, for if the intentions ever changed, America would find itself with a grossly diminished capacity for effective resistance and a growing inability to shape events."&lt;ref&gt;Kissinger, Henry, (1994). Diplomacy, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, p. 813&lt;/ref&gt; The main interest of the American leaders is maintaining the balance of power in Eurasia&lt;ref&gt;Kissinger, Henry, (1994). Diplomacy, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, p. 810&lt;/ref&gt;

Having converted from ideologist into geopolitician, Kissinger in retrospect interpreted the Cold War in geopolitical terms—an approach not characteristic for his works during the Cold War. Now, however, he stressed on the beginning of the Cold War: "The objective of moral opposition to Communism had merged with the geopolitical task of containing the Soviet expansion."&lt;ref&gt;Kissinger, Henry, (1994). Diplomacy, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, p. 804&lt;/ref&gt; Nixon, he added, was geopolitical rather than ideological cold warrior.&lt;ref&gt;Kissinger, Henry, (1994). Diplomacy, New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, p. 703-732&lt;/ref&gt;

Three years after Kissinger's Dilpomacy, [[Brzezinski]] followed suit, launching ''[[The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives]]'' and, after three more years, The Geostrategic Triad: Living with China, Europe, and Russia. The Grand Chessboard described the American triumph in the Cold War in terms of control over Eurasia: for the first time ever, a "non-Eurasian" power had emerged as a key arbiter of "Eurasian" power relations.&lt;ref name="Zbignew Brzezinski 1997 p. 31"&gt;Zbignew Brzezinski, (1997). The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives, Perseus Books, New York, p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; The book states its purpose: "The formulation of a comprehensive and integrated Eurasian geostrategy is therefore the purpose of this book."&lt;ref&gt;Zbignew Brzezinski, (1997). The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives, Perseus Books, New York, p. XIV&lt;/ref&gt; Although the power configuration underwent a revolutionary change, Brzezinski confirmed three years later, Eurasia was still a megacontinent.&lt;ref&gt;Zbignew Brzezinski, (2000). The Geostrategic Triad: Living with China, Europe, and Russia, The CSIS Books, Washington, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt; Like Spykman, Brzezinski acknowledges that: "Cumulatively, Eurasia's power vastly overshadows America's."&lt;ref name="Zbignew Brzezinski 1997 p. 31"/&gt;

In classical Spykman terms, Brzezinski formulized his geostrategic "chessboard" doctrine of Eurasia, which aims to prevent the unification of this megacontinent.&lt;blockquote&gt;"Europe and Asia are politically and economically powerful…. It follows that… American foreign policy must…employ its influence in Eurasia in a manner that creates a stable continental equilibrium, with the United States as the political arbiter.… Eurasia is thus the chessboard on which the struggle for global primacy continues to be played, and that struggle involves geo- strategy – the strategic management of geopolitical interests…. But in the meantime it is imperative that no Eurasian challenger emerges, capable of dominating Eurasia and thus also of challenging America… For America the chief geopolitical prize is Eurasia…and America's global primacy is directly dependent on how long and how effectively its preponderance on the Eurasian continent is sustained."&lt;ref&gt;Zbignew Brzezinski, (1997). The Grand Chessboard: American Primacy and Its Geostrategic Imperatives, Perseus Books, New York, pp. XIII-XIV, 30-31&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Панрегионална доктрина-Хаусхофер.jpg|thumb|upright=1.35|Division of the world according to Haushofer's Pan-Regions Doctrine]]
German ''[[Geopolitik]]'' is characterized by the belief that life of States—being similar to those of human beings and animals—is shaped by scientific [[determinism]] and [[social Darwinism]]. German geopolitics develops the concept of ''[[Lebensraum]]'' (living space) that is thought to be necessary to the development of a nation like a favorable natural environment would be for animals.

=== Friedrich Ratzel ===
[[Friedrich Ratzel]] (1844–1904), influenced by thinkers such as [[Charles Darwin|Darwin]] and [[zoology|zoologist]] [[Ernst Heinrich Haeckel]], contributed to 'Geopolitik' by the expansion on the biological conception of geography, without a static conception of borders. Positing that states are organic and growing, with borders representing only a temporary stop in their movement, he held that the expanse of a state's borders is a reflection of the health of the nation—meaning that static countries are in decline. Ratzel published several papers, among which was the essay "Lebensraum" (1901) concerning [[biogeography]]. Ratzel created a foundation for the German variant of geopolitics, ''geopolitik''. Influenced by the American [[geostrategy|geostrategist]] [[Alfred Thayer Mahan]], Ratzel wrote of aspirations for German naval reach, agreeing that sea power was self-sustaining, as the profit from trade would pay for the merchant marine, unlike land power.

The geopolitical theory of Ratzel has been criticized as being too sweeping, and his interpretation of human history and geography being too simple and mechanistic. Critically, he also underestimated the importance of social organization in the development of power.&lt;ref&gt;O Tuathail (2006) page 20&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The association of German Geopolitik with Nazism ===

After [[World War I]], the thoughts of [[Rudolf Kjellén]] and Ratzel were picked up and extended by a number of German authors such as [[Karl Haushofer]] (1869–1946), [[Erich Obst]], [[Hermann Lautensach]] and [[Otto Maull]]. In 1923, [[Karl Haushofer]] founded the ''Zeitschrift für Geopolitik'' (Journal for Geopolitics), which was later used in the [[propaganda]] of [[Nazi Germany]]. The key concepts of Haushofer's Geopolitik were Lebensraum, [[autarky]], [[pan-region]]s, and organic borders. States have, Haushofer argued, an undeniable right to seek [[natural border]]s which would guarantee [[wikt:autarky|autarky]].

Haushofer's influence within the [[Nazi Party]] has recently been challenged,&lt;ref&gt;O'Tuathail, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; given that Haushofer failed to incorporate the Nazis' racial ideology into his work. Popular views of the role of geopolitics in the Nazi Third Reich suggest a fundamental significance on the part of the geo-politicians in the ideological orientation of the Nazi state. Bassin (1987) reveals that these popular views are in important ways misleading and incorrect.

Despite the numerous similarities and affinities between the two doctrines, geopolitics was always held suspect by the National Socialist ideologists. This was understandable, for the underlying philosophical orientation of geopolitics did not comply with that of National Socialism. Geopolitics shared Ratzel's [[scientific materialism]] and [[geographic determinism]], and held that human society was determined by external influences—in the face of which qualities held innately by individuals or groups were of reduced or no significance. National Socialism rejected in principle both materialism and determinism and also elevated innate human qualities, in the form of a hypothesized 'racial character,' to the factor of greatest significance in the constitution of human society. These differences led after 1933 to friction and ultimately to open [[denunciation]] of geopolitics by Nazi ideologues.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Bassin, "Race Contra Space: The Conflict Between German 'Geopolitik' and National Socialism," ''Political Geography Quarterly'' 1987 6(2): 115-134,&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, German Geopolitik was discredited by its (mis)use in Nazi expansionist policy of [[World War II]] and has never achieved standing comparable to the pre-war period.

The resultant negative association, particularly in U.S. academic circles, between classical geopolitics and Nazi or [[imperialist]] ideology, is based on loose justifications. This has been observed in particular by critics of contemporary academic geography, and proponents of a "neo"-classical geopolitics in particular. These include Haverluk et al., who argue that the stigmatization of geopolitics in academia is unhelpful as geopolitics as a field of positivist inquiry maintains potential in researching and resolving topical, often politicized issues such as [[conflict resolution]] and prevention, and mitigating [[climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1080/14650045.2013.803192 | volume=19 | title=The Three Critical Flaws of Critical Geopolitics: Towards a Neo-Classical Geopolitics | journal=Geopolitics | pages=19–39}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Disciplinary differences in perspectives===
Negative associations with the term "geopolitics" and its practical application stemming from its association with [[World War II]] and pre-World War II German scholars and students of Geopolitics are largely specific to the field of academic [[Geography]], and especially sub-disciplines of [[Human Geography]] such as [[Political Geography]]. However, this negative association is not as strong in disciplines such as [[History]] or [[Political Science]], which make use of geopolitical concepts. Classical Geopolitics forms an important element of analysis for [[Military History]] as well as for subdisciplines of [[Political Science]] such as [[International Relations]] and [[Security Studies]]. This difference in disciplinary perspectives is addressed by Bert Chapman in ''Geopolitics: A Guide To the Issues'', in which Chapman makes note that academic and professional [[International Relations]] journals are more amenable to the study and analysis of Geopolitics, and in particular Classical Geopolitics, than contemporary academic journals in the field of [[Political Geography]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=swINFRDahjYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=bert+chapman+geopolitics Geopolitics: A Guide to the Issues - Bert Chapman - Google Books&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

In disciplines outside [[Geography]], Geopolitics is not negatively viewed (as it often is among academic geographers such as [[Carolyn Gallaher]] or [[Klaus Dodds]]) as a tool of [[Imperialism]] or associated with [[Nazism]], but rather viewed as a valid and consistent manner of assessing major international geopolitical circumstances and events, not necessarily related to armed conflict or military operations.

== France ==
{{refimprove section|date=May 2013}}
French geopolitical doctrines broadly opposed to German [[Geopolitik]] and reject the idea of a fixed geography. French geography is focused on the evolution of polymorphic territories being the result of mankind's actions. It also relies on the consideration of long time periods through a refusal to take specific events into account. This method has been theorized by Professor Lacoste according to three principles: [[Social representation|Representation]]; [[Diachronie]]; and [[Diatopie]].

In ''[[The Spirit of the Laws]]'', [[Montesquieu]] outlined the view that man and societies are influenced by climate. He believed that hotter climates create hot-tempered people and colder climates aloof people, whereas the mild climate of France is ideal for political systems. Considered as one of the founders of French geopolitics, [[Élisée Reclus]], is the author of a book considered as a reference in modern geography (Nouvelle Géographie universelle). Alike Ratzel, he considers geography through a global vision. However, in complete opposition to Ratzel's vision, Reclus considers geography not to be unchanging; it is supposed to evolve commensurately to the development of human society. His marginal political views resulted in his rejection by academia.

[[France|French]] [[geographer]] and geopolitician [[Jacques Ancel]] is considered to be the first theoretician of geopolitics in France, and gave a notable series of lectures at the European Center of the [[Carnegie Endowment for International Peace]] in Paris&lt;!-- this is where Ancel worked – see https://books.google.com.co/books?id=kRl8CwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1&amp;lpg=PA1&amp;dq=jacques+ancel+carnegie&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=3LGDeBAJYD&amp;sig=8OhUn9kBpGDksGAHI0TCz7u48Ak&amp;hl=es-419&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi1v7fzx_PXAhVncd8KHSPqBL0Q6AEINTAB#v=onepage&amp;q=jacques%20ancel%20carnegie&amp;f=false --&gt; and published ''Géopolitique'' in 1936. Like Reclus, Ancel rejects German determinist views on geopolitics (including Haushofer's doctrines).

[[Braudel]]'s broad view used insights from other social sciences, employed the concept of the ''longue durée'', and downplayed the importance of specific events. This method was inspired by the French [[geography|geographer]] [[Paul Vidal de la Blache]] (who in turn was influenced by German thought, particularly that of [[Friedrich Ratzel]] whom he had met in Germany). Braudel's method was to analyse the interdependence between individuals and their environment.&lt;ref&gt;Braudel, ''The Mediterranean and the Mediterranean World in the Age of Philip II'' La part du milieu (vol. 1) {{ISBN|2-253-06168-9}}&lt;/ref&gt; Vidalian geopolitics is based on varied forms of cartography and on ''[[Possibilism (geography)|possibilism]]'' (founded on a societal approach of geography—i.e. on the principle of spaces polymorphic faces depending from many factors among them mankind, culture, and ideas) as opposed to determinism.

Due to the influence of German ''Geopolitik'' on French geopolitics, the latter were for a long time banished from academic works. In the mid-1970s, [[Yves Lacoste]]—a French [[geographer]] who was directly inspired by Ancel, Braudel and Vidal de la Blache—wrote ''La géographie, ça sert d'abord à faire la guerre'' (Geography first use is war) in 1976. This book—which is very famous in France—symbolizes the birth of this new school of geopolitics (if not so far the first French school of geopolitics as Ancel was very isolated in the 1930s–40s). Initially linked with communist party evolved to a less liberal approach. At the end of the 1980s he founded the Institut Français de Géopolitique (French Institute for Geopolitics) that publishes the [[Hérodote]] revue. While rejecting the generalizations and broad abstractions employed by the German and Anglo-American traditions (and the ''new geographers''), this school does focus on spatial dimension of geopolitics affairs on different levels of analysis. This approach emphazises the importance of multi-level (or multi-scales) analysis and maps at the opposite of critical geopolitics which avoid such tools. Lacoste proposed that every conflict (both local or global) can be considered from a perspective grounded in three assumptions:
# '''[[Social representation|Representation]]''': Each group or individuals is the product of an education and is characterized by specific representations of the world or others groups or individuals. Thus, basic societal beliefs are grounded in their ethnicity or specific location. The study of representation is a common point with the more contemporary critical geopolitics. Both are connected with the work of Henri Lefebvre (La production de l'espace, first published in 1974)
# '''Diachronie.''' Conducting an historical analysis confronting "long periods" and short periods as the prominent French historian Fernand Braudel suggested.
# '''Diatopie''': Conducting a cartographic survey through a multiscale mapping.

Connected with this stream, and former member of Hérodote editorial board, the French geographer [[Michel Foucher]] developed a long term analysis of international borders. He coined various neologism among them: ''Horogenesis'': Neologism that describes the concept of studying the ''birth of borders'', ''Dyade'': border shared by two neighbouring states (for instance US territory has two terrestrial dyades : one with Canada and one with Mexico). The main book of this searcher "Fronts et frontières" (Fronts and borders) first published in 1991, without equivalent remains as of yet untranslated in English. Michel Foucher is an expert of the [[African Union]] for borders affairs.

More or less connected with this school, Stéphane Rosière can be quoted as the editor in Chief of the online journal ''L'Espace politique'',&lt;ref&gt;[http://espacepolitique.revues.org/]&lt;/ref&gt; this journal created in 2007 became the most prominent French journal of political geography and Geopolitics with Hérodote.

A much more conservative stream is personified by François Thual. Thual was a French expert in geopolitics, and a former official of the Ministry of Civil Defence. Thual taught geopolitics of the religions at the French War College, and has written thirty books devoted mainly to geopolitical method and its application to various parts of the world. He is particularly interested in the Orthodox, Shiite, and Buddhist religions, and in troubled regions like the [[Caucasus]]. Connected with F. Thual, Aymeric Chauprade, former professor of geopolitics at the French War College and now member of the extreme-right party "Front national", subscribes to a supposed "new" French school of geopolitics which advocates above all a return to ''realpolitik'' and "clash of civilization" (Huntington). The thought of this school is expressed through the French Review of Geopolitics (headed by Chauprade) and the International Academy of Geopolitics. Chauprade is a supporter of a Europe of nations, he advocates a European Union excluding Turkey, and a policy of compromise with Russia (in the frame of a Eurasian alliance which is ''en vogue'' among European extreme-right politists) and supports the idea of a multipolar world—including a balanced relationship between China and the U.S.

In the 1990s a senior researcher at the [[Institute of Philosophy, Russian Academy of Sciences]] of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences]], {{Interlanguage link multi|  Vadim Tsymbursky | ru |3= Цымбурский, Вадим Леонидович}} (1957-2009), coined the term "island-Russia" and developed the "Great Limitrophe" concept.

Colonel-General [[Leonid Ivashov]] (retired), a Russian geopolitics specialist of the early 21st century, headed the [[Academy of Geopolitical Problems]] ({{lang-ru | Академия геополитических проблем}}), which analyzes the international and domestic situations and develops geopolitical doctrine. Earlier, Colonel-General Leonid Ivashov headed the Main Directorate for International Military Cooperation of the [[Ministry of Defence of the Russian Federation]].

== Meta-geopolitics ==
The framework of ''[[Meta]]''-geopolitics, proposed by [[Nayef Al-Rodhan]] combines traditional and new dimensions of geopolitics to offer a multidimensional view of power and power relationships.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lit-verlag.de/isbn/3-643-80006-0 LIT]&lt;/ref&gt; In this framework, the importance of [[geography]] is superseded by the combination of [[Hard power|hard-]] and [[Soft power|soft- power]] tools that states can employ to preserve and obtain power. ''Meta''-geopolitics defines seven key dimensions of state power that include social and health issues, domestic politics, economics, environment, science and human potential, military and security issues, and international diplomacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gcsp.ch/Globalisation/Publications/Faculty-Publications/Books-and-Edited-Volumes/Neo-statecraft-and-Meta-geopolitics-Reconciliation-of-Power-Interests-and-Justice-in-the-21st-Century GCSP] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120314153951/http://www.gcsp.ch/Globalisation/Publications/Faculty-Publications/Books-and-Edited-Volumes/Neo-statecraft-and-Meta-geopolitics-Reconciliation-of-Power-Interests-and-Justice-in-the-21st-Century |date=2012-03-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Meta''-geopolitics framework allows for the assessment of relative strengths and weaknesses as well as predictions about [[future trend]]s. Furthermore, while this analytical grid is relevant for states, it also applies to private and transnational entities, which are playing an increasingly important role in contemporary geopolitics.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thenortherntimes.com.au/news/lifestyle/entertainment/books/neostatecraft-and-metageopolitics-lit-books-switzerland/1991055.aspx The Northern Times] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120324220119/http://www.thenortherntimes.com.au/news/lifestyle/entertainment/books/neostatecraft-and-metageopolitics-lit-books-switzerland/1991055.aspx |date=March 24, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Sir Halford John Mackinder''' {{post-nominals|country=UK|PC}} (15 February 1861 – 6 March 1947) was an English [[geographer]], academic, politician, the first Principal of University Extension College, Reading (which became the [[University of Reading]]) and Director of the [[London School of Economics]], who is regarded as one of the founding fathers of both [[geopolitics]] and [[geostrategy]].

==Early life and education==
Mackinder was born in [[Gainsborough, Lincolnshire]], England, the son of a doctor, and educated at Queen Elizabeth's Grammar School, Gainsborough (now [[Queen Elizabeth's High School]]), [[Epsom College]] and [[Christ Church, Oxford]]. At Oxford he started studying natural sciences, specialising in [[zoology]] under [[Henry Nottidge Moseley]], who had been the naturalist on the [[Challenger expedition]]. When he turned to the study of history, he remarked that he was returning "to an old interest and took up modern history with the idea of seeing how the theory of evolution would appear in human development". He was a strong proponent of treating both [[physical geography]] and [[human geography]] as a single discipline. Mackinder served as President of the [[Oxford Union]] in 1883.&lt;ref&gt;Edmund W. Gilbert, ''British Pioneers in Geography'' (Newton Abbot, David &amp; Charles, 1972), p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

He received a degree in biology in 1883 and one in modern history the next year.&lt;ref name="Sloan1988"&gt;{{cite book|last=Sloan|first=Geoffrey R.|title=Geopolitics in United States Strategic Policy, 1890–1987|date=1 January 1988|publisher=St. Martin's Press|isbn=9780312019549|page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
In 1887, he published "On the Scope and Methods of Geography", a manifesto for the ''New Geography''.&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Mackinder, On the Scope and Methods of Geography, Proceedings of the Royal Geographical Society and Monthly Record of Geography, New Monthly Series, Vol. 9, No. 3 (Mar. 1887), pp. 141–174; J. F. Unstead, H. J. Mackinder and the New Geography, ''Geographical Journal'', Vol. 113, (Jan.–Jun. 1949), pp. 47–57&lt;/ref&gt; A few months later, he was appointed as Reader in Geography at the [[University of Oxford]], where he introduced the teaching of the subject. As Mackinder himself put it, "a platform has been given to a geographer". This was arguably at the time the most prestigious academic position for a British geographer.

In 1892, he was the first Principal of University Extension College, Reading, a role he retained until he was succeeded, in 1903, by [[William Macbride Childs]]. The college became the [[University of Reading]] in 1926, a progression that owed no small debt to his early stewardship of the institution.&lt;ref&gt;Ian Macrae, "The making of a university, the breakdown of a movement: Reading University Extension College to The University of Reading, 1892–1925", ''Journal International Journal of Lifelong Education'', Volume 13, Issue 1 January 1994, pages 3–18&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=willchild&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.reading.ac.uk/bulletin/pdfs/447.pdf|format=PDF|title=University of Reading Bulletin (16 March 2006)|publisher=University of Reading|pages=4|accessdate=10 February 2010|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080308143129/http://www.reading.ac.uk/bulletin/pdfs/447.pdf|archivedate=8 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, he was one of the founders of the [[Geographical Association]], which promotes the teaching of geography in schools. He later became chairman of the GA from 1913 to 1946 and served as its President from 1916.

In 1895, he was one of the founders of the [[London School of Economics]]. At Oxford, Mackinder was the driving force behind the creation of a School of Geography in 1899.&lt;ref&gt;L. M. Cantor, The Royal Geographical Society and the Projected London Institute of Geography 1892–1899. ''Geographical Journal'', Vol. 128, No. 1 (Mar. 1962), pp. 30–35&lt;/ref&gt; In the same year, he led an expedition which was the first to climb [[Mount Kenya]].&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Mackinder, "A Journey to the Summit of Mount Kenya, British East Africa", ''Geographical Journal'', Vol. 15, No. 5 (May 1900), pp. 453–476&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1902, he published ''Britain and the British Seas'', which included the first comprehensive [[geomorphology]] of the [[British Isles]] and which became a classic in regional geography.&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Mackinder, [https://archive.org/details/britainbritishse00mackuoft Britain and the British Seas]. New York: D. Appleton and company, 1902.&lt;/ref&gt;

He was a member of the [[Coefficients (dining club)|Coefficients dining club]], set up in 1902 by the [[Fabian Society|Fabian]] campaigners [[Sidney Webb|Sidney]] and [[Beatrice Webb]], which brought together social reformers and advocates of national efficiency.&lt;ref&gt;Beatrice Webb, ''Our Partnership'', Londres, 1948, p. 312.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1904, Mackinder gave a paper on "[[The Geographical Pivot of History]]" at the [[Royal Geographical Society]], in which he formulated the [[Heartland Theory]].&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Mackinder, The geographical pivot of history. ''Geographical Journal'', 1904, 23, pp. 421–37; Pascal Venier, "[http://www.pascalvenier.com/venier2004c.pdf The Geographical Pivot of History and Early 20th Century Geopolitical Culture]", ''Geographical Journal'', vol. 170, no 4, December 2004, pp. 330–336.&lt;/ref&gt; This is often considered as a, if not the, founding moment of [[geopolitics]] as a field of study, although Mackinder did not use the term. Whilst the Heartland Theory initially received little attention outside geography, this theory would later exercise some influence on the [[foreign policy|foreign policies]] of world powers.&lt;ref&gt;Sloan, G.R. "Sir Halford Mackinder: The heartland theory then and now", in Gray C S and Sloan G.R., ''Geopolitics, Geography and Strategy''. London: Frank Cass, pp. 15–38.&lt;/ref&gt;

Possibly disappointed at not getting a full chairmanship, Mackinder left Oxford and became director of the [[London School of Economics]] in the same year&lt;ref name= "magic Nazism  2016"&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Giorgio Galli]] | url = https://books.google.it/books?id=MUm9saHBVj8C&amp;dq=il+nazismo+magico&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | title = Hitler and the magic Nazism (''Hitler e il Nazismo magico'') | publisher = [[Angelo Rizzoli|Rizzoli]] | location = Trabesaleghe (Padua, IT) | date = Apr 1, 2016 | chapter = | language = it | isbn = 978-88-17-00634-7 | page = 76}}, at chapter 3-"Astrology and Geopolitics" (''Astrologia e geopolitica'')&lt;/ref&gt;. After 1908, he concentrated on advocating the cause of imperial unity and lectured only part-time.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Blouet, "The imperial vision of Halford Mackinder", ''Geographical Journal'', Volume 170 Issue 4, Pages 322–329.&lt;/ref&gt; He stood unsuccessfully as a Unionist in a [[Hawick Burghs by-election, 1909|by-election for Hawick Burghs in 1909]]. He was elected to Parliament in January 1910 as [[Unionist Party (Scotland)|Unionist Party]] member for the [[Glasgow Camlachie (UK Parliament constituency)|Glasgow Camlachie]] constituency and was defeated in 1922. He was [[Knight Bachelor|knighted]] in the 1920 New Year Honours for his services as an MP.&lt;ref&gt;{{London Gazette|issue=31712|date=30 December 1919|page=3 |supp=y}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:Heartland.png|thumb|alt=A crude world map with various zones of influence written on them|right|A 1904 map from Mackinder's ''The Geographical Pivot of History''.]]
His next major work, ''Democratic Ideals and Reality: A Study in the Politics of Reconstruction'', appeared in 1919.&lt;ref&gt;H.J. Mackinder, [http://www.ndu.edu/inss/books/Books%20-%201979%20and%20earlier/Democratic%20Ideals%20and%20Reality%20-%201942/DIR.pdf Democratic Ideals and Reality] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090305174521/http://www.ndu.edu/inss/books/Books%20-%201979%20and%20earlier/Democratic%20Ideals%20and%20Reality%20-%201942/DIR.pdf |date=5 March 2009 }}, Washington, DC: National Defence University Press, 1996&lt;/ref&gt; It followed the 1904 book  titled ''The Geographic Pivot of the Hisotry''&lt;ref name= "magic Nazism  2016" /&gt;, and presented his theory of the Heartland and made a case for fully taking into account geopolitical factors at the Paris Peace conference and contrasted (geographical) reality with [[Woodrow Wilson]]'s idealism. The book's most famous quote was: "Who rules East Europe commands the Heartland; Who rules the Heartland commands the World Island; Who rules the World Island commands the World."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.indrastra.com/2016/06/PAPER-Heartland-Theory-of-Mackinder-Relevancy-in-Central-Asia-Geopolitics-002-06-2016-0043.html|title=THE PAPER {{!}} "Heartland Theory" of Mackinder &amp; its Relevancy in Central Asia Geopolitics|last=Kumar Chowdhury|first=Suban|last2=Hel Kafi|first2=Abdullah|date=|website=IndraStra Global|publisher=|access-date=June 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This message was composed to convince the world statesmen at the Paris Peace conference of the crucial importance of Eastern Europe as the strategic route to the Heartland was interpreted as requiring a strip of buffer state to separate Germany and Russia. These were created by the peace negotiators but proved to be ineffective bulwarks in 1939 (although this may be seen as a failure of other, later statesmen during the interbellum). The principal concern of his work was to warn of the possibility of another major war (a warning also given by economist [[John Maynard Keynes]]).

Mackinder was anti-[[Bolshevik]], and as British High Commissioner in Southern Russia in late 1919 and early 1920, during the Russian Civil War, he stressed the need for Britain to continue her support to the [[White Movement|White Russian]] forces, which he attempted to unite.&lt;ref&gt;Brian W. Blouet, "Sir Halford Mackinder as British high commissioner to South Russia 1919–1920". ''Geographical Journal'', 142 (1976), 228–36.&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackinder's last major work was the 1943 article, “The Round World and the Winning of the Peace,” in which he envisioned a post-war world.  He reiterated and expanded his Heartland view of the world, suggesting that the Atlantic Ocean would be jumped, with North America's influence pulled into the region by its use of Britain as an "moated aerodrome".  Elsewhere in the world, beyond the "girdle of deserts and wilderness", and the "Great Ocean" region of the Indo-Pacific Rim, was the "Monsoon lands" area of India and China that would grow in power.&lt;ref&gt;[http://thediplomat.com/2015/03/halford-mackinders-last-view-of-the-round-world/ Halford Mackinder’s Last View of the Round World]&lt;/ref&gt;

Mackinder was contemporary of the Swedish political scientist [[Rudolf Kjellén]], born three years later, which like him was a conservative deputy at the national parliament from 1910 until 1922 (year of his death)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = [[Giorgio Galli]] | url = https://books.google.it/books?id=MUm9saHBVj8C&amp;dq=il+nazismo+magico&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s | title = Hitler and the magic Nazism (''Hitler e il Nazismo magico'') | publisher = [[Angelo Rizzoli|Rizzoli]] | location = Trabesaleghe (Padua, IT) | date = Apr 1, 2016 | chapter = 3 | isbn = 978-88-17-00634-7 | page = 76}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Both the two fathers of geopolitics and conservative politicians believed that the development of international transportation on land was growing to such a high rate "that the advantage of the sea powers was more of historical importance&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url = https://varldsinbordeskriget.wordpress.com/2011/02/09/rudolf-kjellen-the-swedish-father-of-geopolitics/ | title = Rudolf Kjellen, the Swedish Father of Geopolitics | language = en | website = varldsinbordeskriget.wordpress.com | access-date = Nov 10, 2018 | archive-url = | archive-date = | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Hence, they argued that the pivot of the global political power was the land control of the [[Eurasia]] while a naval power -such as the Great Britain- was playing a secondary role. They disagreed about the Mackinder's emphasis on serving the British Empire&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Barney Warf | url = https://books.google.it/books?id=5791AwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT212&amp;dq=kjellen%2Bmackinder%2Bview%2Bhistory&amp;hl=kn&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj-lIiMu8reAhURrxoKHYrXDoAQ6AEILzAB#v=onepage&amp;q=kjellen%2Bmackinder%2Bview%2Bhistory&amp;f=false | title = Encyclopedia of Human Geography | language = en | publisher = SAGE Publications | date = May 16, 2006 | page = 184 | isbn = 978-1452265339 | archive-url = http://archive.is/O8HWZ | archive-date = Nov 10, 2018 | deadurl = no}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Significance==
Mackinder's work paved the way for the establishment of geography as a distinct discipline in the United Kingdom. His role in fostering the teaching of geography is probably greater than that of any other single British geographer.

Whilst Oxford did not appoint a professor of Geography until 1934, both the [[University of Liverpool]] and [[University of Wales, Aberystwyth]] established professorial chairs in Geography in 1917. Mackinder himself became a full professor in Geography in the University of London ([[London School of Economics]]) in 1923.

Mackinder is often credited with introducing two new terms into the English language: "manpower" and "heartland". In 1944, he received the Charles P. Daley medal from the [[American Geographical Society]], and in 1945 was awarded the [[Royal Geographical Society]]'s [[Gold Medal (RGS)|Patron's Gold Medal]] for his service in the advancement of the science of Geography.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rgs.org/NR/rdonlyres/C5962519-882A-4C67-803D-0037308C756D/0/GoldMedallists18322011.pdf| title=List of Past Gold Medal Winners|publisher= Royal Geographical Society|accessdate = 24 August 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Heartland Theory and more generally classical geopolitics and geostrategy were extremely influential in the making of US strategic policy during the period of the Cold War.&lt;ref&gt;Sloan, G.R. ''Geopolitics in United States Strategic Policy'', Brighton: Wheatsheaf Books, 1988.&lt;/ref&gt;  Arguably it continued afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.tomdispatch.com/post/176007/tomgram%3A_alfred_mccoy,_washington%27s_great_game_and_why_it%27s_failing_/ Tomgram: Alfred McCoy, Washington's Great Game and Why It's Failing]&lt;/ref&gt;

Evidence of Mackinder's Heartland Theory can be found in the works of geopolitician [[Dimitri Kitsikis]], particularly in his geopolitical model "[[Intermediate Region]]". To date, at least one academic study, by Mehmet Akif Okur, has critiqued the main perspective of his works.&lt;ref&gt;Mehmet Akif Okur, [http://tdid.ege.edu.tr/files/dergi_14_2/mehmet_akif_okur.pdf “Classical Texts Of the Geopolitics and the “Heart Of Eurasia”], Journal of Turkish World Studies, XIV/2, pp.77-81&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''High Commissioner for the Western Pacific''' was the chief executive officer of the [[British Western Pacific Territories]], a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[British Empire|colonial entity]], which existed from 1877 through 1976. Numerous colonial possessions were attached to the Territories at different times, the most durable constituent colonies being [[Fiji]] (1877 — 1952) and the [[Solomon Islands]] (1893 — 1976).

The office of '''High Commissioner''' never existed independently, but was always filled ''ex officio'' by the Governor of one of the constitutive British islands colonies. The High Commissioners were concurrently [[Governor of Fiji]] from 1877 to the end of 1952, although the office was suspended from 1942 through 1945, with most of the islands under British military rule and others, namely the [[Solomon Islands]], [[Gilbert Islands]] and [[Phoenix Islands]], under [[Japan]]ese occupation. From 1 January 1953 to 1976, when the office was abolished, the [[Governor of the Solomon Islands]] doubled as High Commissioner. They administered from [[Suva]] and [[Honiara]], respectively.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="11760">'''Hillslope evolution''' is the changes in the [[denudation|erosion rates]], erosion styles and form of slopes of hills and mountains over time. 

==Conceptual models==
During most of the 20th century three models of hillslope evolution were widely diffused: slope decline, slope replacement and parallel slope retreat. Until the 1950s models of hillslope form evolution were "central" in [[geomorphology]]. The modern understanding is that the evolution of slopes is much more complex than the classical models of decline, replacement and retreat imply.&lt;ref name=Summerf1991&gt;{{cite book |last=Summerfield |first=Michael A. |date=1991 |title=Global Geomorphology: An introduction to the study of landforms |chapter=Exogenic processes and landforms |url= |location= |publisher=Pearson Education |pages=184–185 |isbn=0-582-30156-4 |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Slope decline===
Slope decline was proposed by [[William Morris Davis]] in his [[cycle of erosion]] theory. It consists of a gradual decrease in slope angle as [[river incision|stream incision]] slows down. This is accompaigned as slopes becomes more gentle they accumulate with fine-grained [[regolith|regolith]] stemming from [[weathering]].&lt;ref name=Summerf1991/&gt;

===Slope replacement===
Slope replacement first proposed by [[Walther Penck]] challenging Davis' ideas on slope development. Slope replacement describes an evolution of slopes that is associated with decreasing rates of over-all erosion ([[denudation]]). It begins with a flatterning of the lowermost slope that propagates upward and backward making the uppermost slope recede and decrease its angle while it remains steeper than the lower portions.&lt;ref name=Summerf1991/&gt;

===Parallel slope retreat===
Slopes evolve by parallel retreat when rock strength remains constant and basal debris, like [[Scree|talus]], is continuously removed. These conditions are often met in areas where hard horizontal rock layers of [[basalt]] or hard [[sedimentary rock]] overlie softer rocks.  Slopes tend to cease to evolve by parallel retreat once overlying hard layers covering softer rock have been fully eroded. As rock strength is related to weathering and weathering to climate in the case a slope retreat over large distances or over long time-spans retreat is unlikely to remain fully parallel. This is because climate changes [[climate change|over time]] and over long distances.&lt;ref name=Summerf1991/&gt;    

Parallel slope and [[scarp retreat]], albeit proposed by early geomorphologists, was notably championed by [[Lester  Charles King]].&lt;ref name=Summerf1991/&gt; King considered scarp retreat and the coalescence of [[pediment (geology)|pediment]]s into [[pediplain]]s a dominant processes across the globe. Further he claimed that slope decline was a special case of slope development seen only in very weak rocks that could not maintain a [[escarpment|scarp]].&lt;ref name=Twidale/&gt; Slopes that are convex upslope and concave downslope and have no free face were held by King to be a form that became common in the [[Neogene|late Tertiary]]. King argued that this was the result of more slowly acting [[surface wash]] caused by carpets of [[grass]] which in turn would have resulted in relatively more [[downhill creep|soil creep]].&lt;ref name=Twidale&gt;{{Citation

===Unequal activity===
The notion that slopes in an area do not develop all at the same time is known as unequal activity. [[Colin Hayter Crick]], who coined the term, proposed that unequal activity may be regulated by removal of debris at the base of slopes. Following this thought erosion by the sea and lateral stream migration are of prime importance as these processes are effective in removing debris.&lt;ref&gt;Huggett, p. 440&lt;/ref&gt; Unequal activity does also imply there are great disparities between stream erosion near stream channels and apparently unchanged uplands, and between headwaters with limited erosion and the more active middle and lower courses of streams.&lt;ref name=Twidale1993&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Twidale |first1=C.R. |author-link=Charles Rowland Twidale |date=1993 |title=C.H. Crickmay, a Canadian rebel |url= |journal=[[Geomorphology (journal)|Geomorphology]] |volume=6 |issue= |pages=357-372 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; From this it is derived that landscapes and slopes with limited river erosion may in many cases be considered as stagnant in their evolution.&lt;ref name=Twidale1993/&gt;

==Numerical models==
{{see also|Soil production function}}
Contrary to early conceptual models that attempt to predict slope form a number of numerical models of erosion focus on describing what is happening at any given time, and are not concerned with changes in form.

Average [[erosion]] rates for a slope has been estimated using numerical models.&lt;ref name=Roering2001/&gt; Using the [[heat transfer]] equation of [[Joseph Fourier|Fourier]] as template W.E.H. Culling reasoned the flux of mass across the height gradient of a slope would could be described in a similar fashion as:&lt;ref name=Roering2001/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Culling |first1=W.E.H. |date=1960 |title=Analytical Theory of Erosion |url= |journal=[[The Journal of Geology]] |volume=68 |issue=3 |pages=336–344 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Equation (1)    {{math|''q̃'' {{=}} ''&amp;minus;K∇z''}}

On the left-hand side is sediment flux which is the volume of the mass that passes a line each time unit (L&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;/LT). ''K'' is a [[rate constant|rate constant]] (L&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;/T), and ''∇z'' the gradient or height difference between two points at a slope divided by their horizontal distance. This model imply sediment fluxes can be estimated from the slope angles (''∇z''). This has been shown to be true for low-angle slopes. For more steep slopes it is not possible to infer sediment fluxes. To address this reality the following model for high angle slopes can be applied:&lt;ref name=Roering2001/&gt;   

;Equation (2)    {{math|''q̃'' {{=}} {{sfrac|''&amp;minus;K∇z''| 1 &amp;minus; (&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;''∇z''&lt;nowiki&gt;|&lt;/nowiki&gt;/''S&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'')&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}}}

''S&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' stands here for the critical gradient which at which erosion and sediment fluxes runs away. This model show that when ''∇z'' is far from ''S&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' it behaves like equation 1. On the contrary when ''∇z'' approaches ''S&lt;sub&gt;c&lt;/sub&gt;'' erosion rates becomes extremely high. This last feature may represent the behavior of [[landslide]]s in steep terrain.&lt;ref name=Roering2001/&gt;

At low erosion rates increased stream or [[river incision]] may make gentle slopes evolve into convex forms. Convex forms can thus indirectly reflect accelerated [[tectonics|crustal uplift]] and its associated river incision.&lt;ref name=Simons1962/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Chorley ''et al''., p. 790&lt;/ref&gt;{{efn-ua|[[Walther Penck]] is commonly but wrongly attributed the notion that accelerated uplift leads to the formation of convex slopes.&lt;ref name=Simons1962&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;}} As shown by equation 2 the angle of steep slopes changes very little even at very high increases of erosion rates, meaning that it is not possible to infer erosion rates from topography in steep slopes other than hinting they are much higher than for lower angle slopes.&lt;ref name=Roering2001&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Roering |first1= Joshua J.|last2=Kirchner |first2=James W.|last3= Dietrich |first3=William E.|author-link3=William E.

===Parabolic hills===
Beginning with the works of [[Grove Karl Gilbert]] (1909) and [[William Morris Davis]] (1892), soil-mantled convex or [[Parabola|parabolic]] hills have long been held to reflect [[steady state]] [[List of types of equilibrium|equilibrium]] conditions of soil production and [[soil erosion]].&lt;ref name=Roering2001/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Fernandes |first1=Nelson F. |last2=Dietrich |first2=William E. |date=1997 |title=Hillslope  evolution  by diffusive  processes: The  timescale  for  equilibrium  adjustments |url= |journal=Water Reseouces Research |volume=33 |issue=6 |pages=1307-1318 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Rigginsetal2011&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Riggins |first1=Susan G. |last2=Anderson |first2=Robert S.|last3=Prestrud Anderson |first3=Suzanne|last4=Tye |first4=Andrew M. |date=2011 |title=Solving a conundrum of a steady-state hilltop with variable soil depths and production rates, Bodmin Moor, UK |url= |journal=Geomorphology |volume=128 |issue= |pages=73–84 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Contrary to what an equilibrium between the erosion rates functions described above and the [[soil production function]] should imply soil depth can vary considerably in parabolic hills as result of [[stochastic]] bedrock [[weathering]] into soil. This means that the expected soil formation rates from the [[soil production function]] might vary greatly across a landscape in geomorphic equilibrium.&lt;ref name=Rigginsetal2011/&gt;

Convex hills are often associated to [[Tor (rock formation)|tor]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Linton |first1=David L.|author-link=David Leslie Linton  |date=1955 |title=The problem of tors |url= |journal=[[The Geographical Journal]] |volume=121 |issue=4 |pages= 470-487 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Numerical modelling indicate that in [[periglaciation|periglacial settings]] broad low-angle convex hilltops can form in no less than millions of years. During the evolution of these slopes steeper initial slopes are calculated to result in the formation of numerous tors during the course of the loweing and broadening of the convex area. The presence of numerous tors would thus indicate that the original landscape was steeper and not flatter than present-day landscape.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=Robert S. |date=2002 |title=Modeling the tor-dotted crests, bedrock edges, and parabolic profiles of high alpine surfaces of the Wind River Range, Wyoming |url= |journal= |volume=46 |issue= |pages=35–58 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Janzen–Connell hypothesis''' is a widely accepted explanation for the maintenance of [[tree]] [[species]] [[biodiversity]] in [[tropical rainforests]].  It was published independently in the early 1970s by [[Daniel Janzen]]&lt;ref name="Janzen"&gt;Janzen, Daniel H. "Herbivores and the Number of Tree Species in Tropical Forests." The American Naturalist. 104.940 (1970).&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Joseph Connell]].&lt;ref name="Connell"&gt;Connell, J.H. "On the role of natural enemies in preventing competitive exclusion in some marine animals and in rain forest trees." In: Dynamics of Population. Ed. P.J. Den Boer and G.R. Gradwell. Wageningen: Pudoc, 1970.&lt;/ref&gt; According to their hypothesis, [[Host (biology)|host]]-specific [[Herbivore|herbivores]], [[pathogens]], or other [[natural enemies]] (often referred to as [[Predation|predators]]&lt;ref name="Janzen" /&gt;) make the areas near a parent tree (the seed producing tree) inhospitable for the survival of seedlings.  These natural enemies are referred to as 'distance-responsive predators' if they kill seeds or seedlings near the parent tree, or 'density-dependent predators' if they kill seeds or seedlings where they are most abundant (which is typically near the parent tree&lt;ref name="Janzen" /&gt;). Such predators can prevent any one species from dominating the landscape, because if that species is too common, there will be few safe places for its seedlings to survive.  However, because the predators are host-specific (also called [[specialist predator|specialists]]), they will not harm other tree species.  As a result, if a species becomes very rare, then more predator-free areas will become available, giving that species' seedlings a competitive advantage.  This negative feedback allows the tree species to coexist, and can be classified as a [[coexistence theory|stabilizing mechanism]].

The Janzen-Connell hypothesis has been called a special case of [[keystone species|keystone predation]], [[niche partitioning#Types of niche differentiation|predator partitioning]] or the pest pressure hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Carson"&gt;Carson, Walter A. and Stefan A. Schnitzer. Tropical Forest Community Ecology. Blackwell Publishing: Hoboken, NJ, 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gilbert2005"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gilbert|first1=Gregory|editor1-last=Burslem|editor1-first=David|editor2-last=Pinard|editor2-first=Michelle|editor3-last=Hartley|editor3-first=Sue|title=Biotic interactions in the tropics : their role in the maintenance of species diversity|date=2005|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=Cambridge, UK|isbn=9780521609852|pages=141-164}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The pest pressure hypothesis states that plant diversity is maintained by specialist natural enemies.&lt;ref name="gillette1962"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gillette|first1=J.B.|title=Pest pressure, an underestimated factor in evolution|journal=Taxonomy and Geography; a symposium|date=1962|volume=4|issue=37|pages=37-46}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The Janzen-Connell hypothesis expands on this, by claiming that the natural enemies are not only specialists, but also are distance-responsive or density-responsive.&lt;ref name="Janzen" /&gt;

This mechanism has been proposed as promoting diversity of forests as it promotes survival of a number of different plant species within one localized region. While previously thought to explain the high diversity of tropical forests in particular, subsequent research has demonstrated the applicability of the Janzen–Connell hypothesis in temperate settings as well. The Black Cherry is one such example of a [[temperate forest]] species whose growth patterns can still be explained by the Janzen–Connell hypothesis.

==History==

===Daniel Janzen’s hypothesis===
Daniel Janzen published his hypothesis in 1970 in ''[[The American Naturalist]]'' under the article "Herbivores and the Number of Tree Species in Tropical Forests."&lt;ref name="Janzen" /&gt; His hypothesis was based on the observation that in tropical forests (when compared to temperate forests), there were few new adult trees in the immediate vicinity of their parent tree. He explained the low density of tropical trees and lack of "bunching" of tree types around parent trees for two reasons: (1) the number of [[seeds]] decline with distance from the parent tree and (2) that the adult tree, its seeds, and seedlings are a source of food for host-specific parasites and diseases.
Using his observations, Janzen created a model demonstrating the probability of a seed maturation or a seedling survival as a function of distance from the parent tree (as well as total seed count, dispersal mechanism, and predatorial activity).

===Joseph Connell hypothesis===
Joseph Connell published his hypothesis in 1971 in Dynamics of Populations.&lt;ref name="Connell" /&gt; Unlike Janzen, Connell proposed experiments that focused on the key prediction that exclusion of host-specific predators would cause a decrease in diversity as tree species with greater establishment or competitive ability formed low-diversity seedling and sapling communities where dominance was concentrated in a few species.

He formed his hypothesis through observations in [[Queensland]], Australia.  Along with Jack Greening Tracey and Larry Johnson Webb, he mapped trees in two rainforests and observed that smaller seedlings tended to occur in single-species clumps.  Smaller seedlings also exhibited greater [[Mortality rate|mortality]], especially when their nearest neighbor was an individual of the same species.  This pattern lessened with growth and age until seedlings exhibited similar pattern diversity to adults.  To reinforce these observations, Connell ran an experiment showing that adult trees have a deleterious effect on smaller trees of the same species.  In another experiment, Connell found that pre-germination predation was greater on seeds near adults of the same species than those near adults of others.  Through these observations, Connell suggests that each tree species has host-specific enemies that attack it and any of its offspring which are close to the parent.  This emphasizes the importance of the role of predation in preventing trees from forming single-species groves, which is probably the only way in which one species of tree could exclude others by interspecies competition.

==Effects on forest dynamics==

===Disease dynamics and tree density===
Plant pathogens follow [[infectious disease dynamics]]. The [[basic reproductive rate]] &lt;math&gt;(R_0)&lt;/math&gt; of a disease is dependent on three variables such that:

&lt;br&gt;{{math|''R''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; {{=}} &amp;beta;''L''''S''}}&lt;br&gt;
&lt;br&gt;Where &amp;beta; is the transmission rate or infectiousness of the disease, ''L'' is the average infection time of the host, and ''S'' is the density of the host population.  By decreasing any one of the variables, the reproduction rate of the disease decreases.  Since seed dispersal is such that the highest density of seeds is around the parent with density decreasing with distance from the parent, the reproduction rate of a disease infecting seeds and seedlings will be highest around the parent and decrease with distance. Thus, seedlings close to the parent are likely to die due to the disease prevalence. However, seedlings farther away are less likely to encounter the disease and therefore will more likely grow into adults.

===Herbivory and tree density===
Specialist herbivores who consume plant matter can also be thought of as having a "transmission rate" between individuals similarly to a disease. Tree predators (especially herbivorous insects) are limited by the ease of movement. When individuals are closer together at high density, movement between trees is easier and the predators quickly spread out. However, at low tree density, predators can not find the next individual with as much ease and thus often have low transmission rates leading to less specialist predation.

==Problematic aspects==

Many studies examining the Janzen–Connell hypothesis have shown supporting patterns with a number of tree species, but despite this there are also problematic aspects of the hypothesis.
# The first is that the Janzen–Connell hypothesis explains diversity at a community-wide scale, but most studies have only looked at a single species or a localized region. Most studies do not test the diversity prediction and did not determine the causes for patterns consistent with Janzen–Connell effects.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;  As Wright (2002) pointed out, "field measurements only demonstrate that niche differences, Janzen–Connell effects, and negative density dependence occur. Implications for species coexistence and plant diversity remain conjectural."&lt;ref&gt;Wright, J.S.  "Plant diversity in tropical forests: a review of mechanisms of species coexistence."  Oecologia. 130.1 (2002): 1–14.&lt;/ref&gt;
# While these host-specific predators may play [[keystone species]] roles as they possibly aid in the prevention of superior tree competitors from monopolizing an area, no study has yet to examine species richness and abundance after removing natural enemies, creating a gap in the supporting research for the hypothesis.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;
# Diversity may be maintained, at least in part, by episodic outbreaks of specialized pests, which may reduce the survivorship, growth, and [[fecundity|reproductive success]] of adults of a species whenever they are particularly aggregated.  Thus, specialist predation also impacts adult density, rather than just juveniles which has been the focus of research efforts.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;
# Disease and predation may be just affecting overall density rather than in localized regions around adults alone.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;
# Theoretical work has suggested that distance-responsive predators are less able to promote coexistence than equivalent predators that are not distance-responsive.&lt;ref name="stump2015"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Stump|first1=Simon Maccracken|last2=Chesson|first2=Peter|title=Distance-responsive predation is not necessary for the Janzen–Connell hypothesis|journal=Theoretical Population Biology|date=December 2015|volume=106|pages=60–70|doi=10.1016/j.tpb.2015.10.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
# Many empirical studies have shown that few natural enemies are host-specific specialists,&lt;ref name="novotny2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Novotny|first1=V.|last2=Basset|first2=Y.|title=Host specificity of insect herbivores in tropical forests|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B: Biological Sciences|date=7 June 2005|volume=272|issue=1568|pages=1083–1090|doi=10.1098/rspb.2004.3023|pmc=1559807}}&lt;/ref&gt; as the original hypothesis claimed.  However, theoretical work has suggested that predators can have broader diets as long as they are more damaging to their primary host than other species.&lt;ref name="sedio2013"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sedio|first1=Brian E.|last2=Ostling|first2=Annette M.|last3=Ris Lambers|first3=Janneke Hille|title=How specialised must natural enemies be to facilitate coexistence among plants?|journal=Ecology Letters|date=August 2013|volume=16|issue=8|pages=995–1003|doi=10.1111/ele.12130}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# The responses of density-dependent predators' may not be restricted to a single trophic level, and when multiple trophic levels interact, Janzen-Connell effects may be negated. This is an example of "the enemy of my enemy is my friend"  and it has been shown that the potential of host-specific insects to induce negative-density dependence in plant populations can be severely limited when the natural enemies of the seed predators are also density responsive &lt;ref name="VisserMuller-Landau2011"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Visser|first1=Marco D.|last2=Muller-Landau|first2=Helene C.|last3=Wright|first3=S. Joseph|last4=Rutten|first4=Gemma|last5=Jansen|first5=Patrick A.|title=Tri-trophic interactions affect density dependence of seed fate in a tropical forest palm|journal=Ecology Letters|volume=14|issue=11|year=2011|pages=1093–1100|issn=1461023X|doi=10.1111/j.1461-0248.2011.01677.x}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Research testing the hypothesis==

===Supporting research===
There have been over 50 studies designed to test predictions of this hypothesis in tropical and other settings and most show that many tree species exhibit patterns consistent with Janzen–Connell effects.  Studies that have supported the Janzen–Connell hypothesis:
* A 2010 study of [[Panama]] forest reinforced that Janzen–Connell effects are also prevalent in tropical rainforests as seedlings growing close to their parents are likely to die due to [[microorganisms]] in the soil.&lt;ref&gt;Mangan, Scott A., et al. "Negative plant–soil feedback predicts tree-species relative abundance in a tropical forest." Nature 466 (8 July 2010) 752–755.&lt;/ref&gt;
* A 2008 study by Petermann ''et al.'' in [[grasslands]] showed that soil-borne pests created a feedback very similar to the Janzen–Connell effect, supporting the hypothesis as a driver of diversity in temperate [[ecosystems]]. This study suggests that the predator/density mechanism that promotes species diversity is not contained to tropical forests alone – even if tropical ecosystems do have the highest diversity. This supports the hypothesis as a mechanism for diversity, but not as an explanation [[latitudinal gradients in species diversity]].&lt;ref&gt;Pertermann, Jana S. et al. "Janzen–Connell Effects are Widespread and Strong Enough to Maintain Diversity in Grasslands." Ecology 89.9 (2008): 2399–2406.&lt;/ref&gt;
* An examination of spatial data for 24 woody tropical rain forest plants showed either density-dependence or distance-dependence in plant offspring, supporting the hypothesis. However, other causal factors such as [[allelopathy]] were also suggested in some cases.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Deborah A. and David B. Clark. "Dynamics of a Tropical Rain Forest Tree: Evaluation of the Janzen–Connell Model." The American Naturalist. 124.6 (1984):769–788.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Dissenting Research===
Studies questioning the Janzen–Connell hypothesis:
* Hyatt ''et al.'' examined the hypothesis across a number of tree species (rather than focusing on the effects on just one) and found no support for the distance-dependence of the hypothesis and concluded that the Janzen–Connell hypothesis was not a mechanism for diversity. They did find however that in temperate settings, distance from parent reduced survivorship. But in tropical settings there was a slight positive correlation between the improved competitive ability of seeds and  distance from parent.&lt;ref name="Hyatt"&gt;Hyatt, Lauren A. et al. "The Distance Dependence Prediction of the Janzen–Connell Hypothesis: a Meta-Analysis." Oikos. 103.3 (2003): 590–602.&lt;/ref&gt;  These findings were later challenged: Using additional data, and slightly different statistical techniques, Comita ''et al.''&lt;ref name="comita_2014_meta"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Comita|first1=Liza S.|last2=Queenborough|first2=Simon A.|last3=Murphy|first3=Stephen J.|last4=Eck|first4=Jenalle L.|last5=Xu|first5=Kaiyang|last6=Krishnadas|first6=Meghna|last7=Beckman|first7=Noelle|last8=Zhu|first8=Yan|last9=Gómez-Aparicio|first9=Lorena|title=Testing predictions of the Janzen-Connell hypothesis: a meta-analysis of experimental evidence for distance- and density-dependent seed and seedling survival|journal=Journal of Ecology|date=July 2014|volume=102|issue=4|pages=845–856|doi=10.1111/1365-2745.12232|pmc=4140603}}&lt;/ref&gt; showed that there was strong evidence for distance-dependence at the seedling stage, but not at the seed stage.
* A 1994 study by Burkey found that seed predation did not follow a pattern supporting that of the Janzen–Connell hypothesis along a meaningful scale. Seeds within 1 metre from the trunk were highly predated. However, seeds reached their peak density while still under the [[Canopy (biology)|canopy]] of their parent. The authors concluded that seed predation did not follow the Janzen–Connell hypothesis.&lt;ref&gt;Burkey, T.V. "Tree Species Diversity: A Test of the Janzen–Connell Model." Oecologia. 97. (1994): 533–540.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Current conclusions and further research==
It is tricky to form conclusions regarding the accuracy of the Janzen–Connell hypothesis as it is difficult to falsify. This is because:
* Heavy predation may keep some species rare and widely spaced, and these species may also be the best competitors.  If so, these species are most likely to form dense aggregations that would reduce diversity in local areas. But due to their rarity or a belief that rare species are not regulated by density-dependence, these species may be the ones least likely to be studied.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;
* This means that the failure to find Janzen–Connell effects for what could be hundreds of tree species does not reject the hypothesis, as ecologists are missing the few key species where it does apply. However, dissenting findings do reduce the importance of the hypothesis for explaining overall coexistence of a number species.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;
** For example, Hyatt ''et al.'' (2003) found that there were "individual cases of conformity to the hypothesis,"&lt;ref name="Hyatt" /&gt; which is all that is needed for the hypothesis to work if the specific cases represent tree species that are excellent competitors, highly shade tolerant, habitat generalists, or some combination of these traits that would allow these species to otherwise dominate the ecosystem.&lt;ref name="Carson" /&gt;

It is likely that a number of mechanisms underscore the coexistence of similar species and thus cause biodiversity in ecosystems. It is possible the Janzen–Connell hypothesis is applicable only for some species depending on species characteristics. The hypothesis may also be affected by the kind of predator or pathogen as preliminary research has shown that the hypothesis is true only when host-specific predators have limited mobility with a range less than the seed dispersal range.&lt;ref&gt;Nathan, Ran and Renato Casagrandi. "A simple mechanistic model of seed dispersal, predation and plant establishment: Janzen–Connell and beyond." Journal of Ecology. 92. (2004): 733–746.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
This road is part of an important road corridor that links the four counties that it passes through, to markets in Uganda and [[South Sudan]]. The od also connects to [[Tanzania]] via the [[Isebania–Kisii–Ahero Road]]. The road is divided into three sections, namely (a) Kisumu–Kakamega (b) Kakamega–Webuye and (c) Webuye–Kitale. The road is designated as a Class A road, and is under the jurisdiction of [[Kenya National Highway Authority]].&lt;ref name="Work"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.capitalfm.co.ke/news/2016/02/kenha-says-roads-rehabilitation-works-western-coast-ongoing/ |title=KeNHA says roads rehabilitation works in Western and Coast ongoing|accessdate=4 April 2016| date=4 February 2016| first=Simon| last=Ndonga|publisher=[[98.4 Capital FM]]| location=Nairobi}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Upgrading and widening==
Beginning in 2015, the [[Government of Kenya]], through its parastatal KeNHA began to widn the road to 11 meters (36 feet), with shoulders, culverts, drainage channels, passing lanes, bus stops and access roads in urban centres. In some sections the road will be widened to dual carriage.&lt;ref name="Dual"&gt;{{cite web|title=Kenya road expansion project to start in October 2012|

==Introduction==
The LinPan in Chengdu Plain, as a principle rusticity landscape in the Chengdu Plain might be define as a complex habitation mode. Generalized Linpan in Chengdu Plain refers to the Linpan Settlement system in the region of Chengdu Plain, also known as Linpan settlement. Moreover, LinPan in Chengdu Plain  are the representative of farming type in western Sichuan that combine production and daily life in one landscape. It is understood that the cores of Linpan in Chengdu plain are trees and bamboo, but the main inscapes of this landscape are water, houses and fields, including any kinds of natural and artificial elements. It is usually inhabited by surname or clan as settlement units showing the layout in a decentralized manner and in the form of a typical natural villages. Small-scale Linpan generally have only a few dozen peasant families, however large-scale Linpan may contain hundreds of households.

Linpan in Chengdu Plain originated during the [[:zh:古蜀文明|Ancient Shu Civilization]] and formed in a long period of immigration, which has been thousands of years history. It is not only reflected in the local farming culture, but also is the crystallization of traditional farming civilization era. The Linpan Settlement system coordinates with local farming conditions, traditional farming behavior and living life, and plays a crucial role in preserving the environment of Chengdu Plain.&lt;ref name="Fan Yanzhi"&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Fan |first=Yanzhi |date=2009 |title=川西林盘环境景观保护性规划设计研究 |trans-title= |type=MSc |chapter= |publisher=Sichuan Agricultural University |docket= |oclc= |url=http://cdmd.cnki.com.cn/Article/CDMD-10626-2009258597.htm |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Furthermore, it has society, culture, aesthetic and ecology value and make the rural landscape of Chengdu Plain different from the other area of China. The key reasons that it came into being, can be analyzed as natural environment, farm culture, the history of immigration, society culture.&lt;ref name="Linpan book"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Duang|first1=Peng|last2=Liu|first2=Tianhou|title=林盘: 蜀文化之生态家园|trans-title=Linpan: The ecological homeland of Shu culture|date=2004|publisher=Sichuan Science Technology Press|location=Chengdu|isbn=7-5364-5577-1|edition=Di 1 ban.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The rural landscape of Chengdu can be described as patches(the vast plain of farm land ), corridors(roads and irrigation Canals ), and matrixes(small matrixes are thousands of Linpans, big ones are towns). Linpan is the key element that make Chengdu rural landscape unique.&lt;ref name="the rural landscape" /&gt;

==Features==

===Culture===
Linpan Settlement in Chengdu Plain inherited Chinese traditional farming culture and has a farming history for thousands of years, but it also has its own characteristics. [[Sichuan]] is a historic and typical region of traditional intensive farming culture in China, while the Chengdu Plain, is an important place of origin and development of this culture. Chengdu Plain provides the requisite conditions for the continuation and development of the farming culture, such as pleasant environmental conditions, warm and humid climate, abundant water and fertile land.

In the second place, Linpan in Chengdu Plain combines the [[Dujiangyan irrigation system]], agricultural production, family system and lifestyle, that integrates the daily life in Chengdu Plain, production and ecological environment. It is a perfect combined spatial form of cultural symbol and use value. Linpan in Chengdu Plain formed as the basis of millennial Dujiangyan irrigation works, which solved the decisive factor, water, for the farming culture development. Formed a pattern of ecological farming, which regard Dujiangyan irrigation system as its core, Chengdu plain as its hinterland and Longquan Range as its protective screen. The intensive Linpan Settlements, fully reflects the farming culture which has the Sichuan water cultural characteristic.

===Ecology===
Chengdu Plain irrigated by the Dujiangyan irrigation system is a semi-natural wetland ecosystems. It provides a habitat for birds, but also provides a food base and living space for human beings. The symbiosis of people and woods even more continues today. The mainly landscape elements in this living environment are fields, woods, farmhouse and water and these four main elements are harmony and interdependence：

*Pattern of woods-water, creates the integration of woods forest network and water network.
*Pattern of woods-fields, shows a high performance in biodiversity.
*Pattern of woods-farm house, creates a pleasant microclimate.
In terms of vegetation other than crops,  the dominant plant type in Chengdu Plain is evergreen broad-leaved forest because Chengdu locates in the subtropical humid monsoon climate zone. Affected by the same rainfall and heat pattern, Linpan demonstrates similar zonal characteristics in the natural distribution of plant community structure with some distinctive variations. In the Linpan landscape, the main vegetation types surrounding residential buildings are evergreen broad-leaved forests and bamboo stands with frequencies of 25% and 32%, respectively. In contrast to the overall high biodiversity of Linpan as a rural settlement, the vegetation around houses are rather uniform. In most farming Linpan, the plant structure is dominated by a single type of tree or bamboo such as Metasequoia or Cedar. The relatively mixed forests mostly exist in Linpan aiming at developing rural tourism.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=孙大江|last2=陈其兵|last3=胡庭兴|last4=刘光立|last5=孙大远|last6=罗启高|date=2011|title=川西林盘群落类型及其多样性|url=http://www.cqvip.com/qk/91109x/201101/37279682.html|journal=四川农业大学学报|volume=29|issue=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Form===
The whole Linpan settlement in Chengdu Plain that lies between the cities and towns as roads crisscross, coupled with the water-intensive. It is in space to form a "checkerboard" pattern, such a network, which distributed a number of scattered Linpan landscape units.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite thesis |last=Zhao |first=Rongming |date=2006 |title=成都城市边缘区乡村聚落规划设计面临的问题与对策研究 |trans-title= |type=MSc |chapter= |publisher=Southwest Jiaotong University |docket= |oclc= |url=http://d.wanfangdata.com.cn/Thesis/Y1019960 |access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Linpan Settlement generally based on single-family or family group as a unit, scattered among the field.

In terms of shape it is characterized by small-scale and recognizability. The scale of the farm village in Chengdu Plain is very small. The radius of the buildings, surrounding courtyards and [[bamboo]]s always within 30 meters. This kind of compact small village has a strong identifiable and easy for people to grasp farming activities.

The buildings in Linpan are generally typical one-story Western Sichuan folk residential buildings with Galley or L-shape layout built by individual household respectively. Usually, 3-5 household form a small Linpan unit, and 20-30 households form a big Linpan unit，which are surrounded by tall trees and bamboos to shelter from wind.

One of the most significant features of Linpan and almost all Western Sichuan folk housing is that the buildings always enclose a courtyard called “Baba”, and “Baba” is where most domestic and interactive activities happen. People dry crops, hang out washed clothes, talk and play [[Mahjong]] with neighbors, and even host family banquets (Baba Yan) in the "Baba" courtyards.

== The Causes for the Formation of Linpan Culture ==

=== Geographical and Environmental Conditions ===
Chengdu Plain is a relatively independent and complete geographic unit sitting in the western [[Sichuan Basin]]. The area of Chengdu Plain is about 9100 square kilometers in size and 450–750 meters in altitude. Chengdu Plain is a river alluvial plain, and its fertile soil and large open flat land provides a firm foundation for farming development. In addition, the mild subtropical monsoon climate brings rich heat and abundant rainfall, making it suitable for human habitation and production. With the warm winter and the early spring, crops and bamboos can grow  year round. Another unique advantage of Chengdu Plain is the well-developed irrigation system.  After the construction of [[Dujiangyan]], most farmland achieved gravity irrigation. Along with ample surface and groundwater resources, the dispersed rural living pattern became possible.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://en.cnki.com.cn/Article_en/CJFDTOTAL-CDDB201105014.htm|title=On Causes for Formation of Linpan Culture in West Sichuan Plain--《Journal of Chengdu University(Social Sciences)》2011年05期|website=en.cnki.com.cn|access-date=2017-11-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Economics and Production ===
The relatively stable climate and advanced water irrigation and management system in western Sichuan provide a powerful guarantee for the independent farming of individual households. In order to promote crop production, farmers choose to live scattered near their own land to devote more labor to intensive rice farming. In addition, the scattered pattern solves the shortcomings of long distance transportation in the fields. Moreover, surplus manpower and large courtyards make it possible for farmers to supplement agricultural income by operating home textiles, bamboo basket weaving or raising livestock, and grow fruits and vegetables. With all these factors, the production of the Linpan gradually evolved into the current pattern.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Migration ===
There have been six large-scale migrations in history from other provinces to Sichuan province, creating the unique and inclusive culture of an immigrant society. Migrants promoted the social and economic development of the region in many ways and various customs they introduced created the compatible features of a new culture. During the migration process, bloodlines were broken and the concept of clans was diluted, so rather than being bind by kinships, people were more related by geographic and production approximaty. In the new settlements, people could be equal regardless of their origins, allowing the Linpan culture of a scattered living pattern to flourish.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

=== Culture and Customs ===
Western Sichuan Plain is an important source of [[Taoism]]. Since the [[:zh:古蜀文明|Ancient Shu Civilization]], people living in the region have valued nature and freedom over careers and regulations. Later generations of the Shu in the unique geographical and cultural environment also inherited the philosophy of prioritizing pleasure, leisure, and the freedom of life, which formed the social basis for Linpan culture. Another reason explaining the settlement pattern is the tradition of living separately in single-family homes instead of large unified homes with parents and relatives. By splitting up into smaller units, there are more initiative and flexibility for households to live and produce.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Distribution of Linpan==
Linpan Settlement mainly distributed in the Chengdu Plain, however, Chengdu Plain belongs to the Sichuan Basin. [[Sichuan Basin]] is one of the famous big basin in china, whose terrain is relatively inaccessible. It is surrounded by 1000–2000 meters above sea level mountain, one of the few mountain up to an altitude of 3000–4000 meters. Basin covers an area of about 170,000 square kilometers, mostly in elevation between 300–700 meters.

The Chengdu Plain covers an area of about 23,000 square kilometers and is the largest plain in southwestern China. It lies on the marginal region of the Sichuan Basin and rivers from the high mountains to the north and west brings soil and water supply to the vast land.&lt;ref name="GO CD"&gt;{{cite web|title=What makes Chengdu the Land of Abundance|url=http://www.gochengdu.cn/culture/city-profile/what-makes-chengdu-the-land-of-abundance-a593.html|website=GO CHENGDU|accessdate=25 July 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Chengdu Plain located among Longquan range, [[Longmen Mountains]] and [[Qionglai Mountains]].&lt;ref name="Linpan book" /&gt; The great [[Min River (Sichuan)|Minjiang River]], together with its tributaries, runs across the Chengdu Plain to form an expansive water network.&lt;ref name="GO CD" /&gt; Because the formation of factors, Linpan mainly distributed in flat terrain area, that the most typical ones are in Chengdu Plain. In addition to Sichuan in China's western provinces of [[Yunnan]], [[Guizhou]] and other places also have distribution.

The typical Linpan Settlements mainly distributed in 14 districts(cities) of Chengdu Plain are [[Longquanyi District]], [[Pi County]], [[Wenjiang District]], [[Shuangliu District]], [[Xindu District]], [[Qingbaijiang District]], [[Dayi County]], [[Xinjin County]], [[Jintang County]], [[Pujiang County, Sichuan|Pujiang County]], [[Dujiangyan City]], [[Pengzhou]], [[Chongzhou|Chongzhou City]], [[Qionglai City]],covers an area of 11,711 square kilometers. According to statistics, Linpan in Chengdu Plain demonstrate a  wide distribution (area of 9482 square kilometers). a total of 141,100 existing Linpan, Linpan total area of 67,679.87 hectares, the population living within Linpan 449.03 million, accounting for 41.50 percent of the total population of the city region, representing the city 77.09% of the total rural population; Linpan per capita area of 150 square meters. The number of existing Linpan is around 141,100, with a total area of 67,679.87 hectares. The resident population of Linpan in Chengdu is about 449.03 million, accounting for 41.50% of the total population of the city region and 77.09% of the city total rural population.&lt;ref name="jianwei"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Chengdu|first1=Urban and Rual Construction Commission|title=成都编制规划保护川西林盘风貌|journal=Urban Planning Newsreport|date=2007|volume=17|pages=8–9|url=http://www.cnki.com.cn/Article/CJFDTotal-CSGT200717010.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Types of Linpan Settlement==

===Farming Type===
This type of Linpan settlement mainly focus on agricultural production. The vegetation and buildings in this kind of Linpan Settlement should harmonize with the fields, and it is the ecological residence of the rural population who engaged in agricultural activities. It is also the typical vector, which is the symbiosis of people, fields, buildings, woods and water. There are some unique spatial features of the farming Linpan, which provide spaces for drying cereals and corn, stacking farming tools, intensively-reared livestock etc. These characteristics are reflected that in this kind of Linpan settlement farming as the main mode of industrial structure.

===Ecological Type===
With the change of time, social development, improvement of living standards and the progress of rural-urban integration, at the same time Linpan also changing.The villagers no longer satisfied with living a life of self-sufficient farming, they move to the urban area from Linpan Settlement, that causing some empty linpan Settlements. The role of these "Empty Linpan" is no longer for living, but has transformed to the ecological Linpan which has an ecological function for preserving the local environment.

===Rural Tourism Type===
At present, the rapid population growth led to urban sprawl and dwindling agricultural land resources. rural tourism as a compound of agricultural production and economic activities has become more and more popular. Thus, Rural Tourism type of Linpan emerged in Chengdu Plain. This type of Linpan mostly located in suburban areas, relying on agricultural production and make full use of the environment and transport advantages to develop rural inn and farmhouse catering services.It not only can satisfy local people's production and living needs, but also provide a tourism and vacation place for urban residents.

===Specific Industrial Type===
The main function of agricultural and forest land in specific industrial Linpan is production. Generally, the in the requirements of landscape aesthetic is less than the other types of Linpan. This type of Linpan create the multiple agricultural eco-landscape. This kind of Linpan make use of the traditional specific industry and enhance it, such as anti-season greenhouse vegetables and fruits, courtyard economy, livestock raising and other specific industries.

==The Threaten of Linpan in Chengdu Plain==
With the implementation of changes in land use policies and urban-rural integration in China, most households are grouped together as a group-type settlement during the new rural construction. The original distribution of Linpan formula has been greatly affected by the construction practices of farmers and the government, and the distance between farmers and land is also pulled away. Many factors can cause the number of Linpan Settlement dwindle. On one hand, many Linpan Settlement were removed or merged into a larger one. On the other hand, with the increasing number of part of the Linpan dwellers drift into cities, many Linpan Settlements are lack of management and change to be “Hollow Linpan”. All of these lead the number of Linpan Settlement decreasing each year. [[Pi County]], a country near Chengdu, had more than 11,000 Linpan Settlement while there only has 8,000 now. A recent survey shows that the number of Linpan which holds more than 10 households living in is less than 900.&lt;ref name="Fan Yanzhi" /&gt;

This is a '''list of Donald mountains in Scotland by height'''.  [[Lists of mountains and hills in the British Isles#Donalds|Donalds]] were defined in 1935 by [[Scottish Mountaineering Club]] ("SMC") member Percy Donald, as [[Scottish lowlands]] mountains over {{convert|2000|ft|1}} in height,  the general requirement to be called a [[Lists of mountains and hills in the British Isles#Elevation|"mountain"]] in the British Isles, and over {{convert|100|ft|1}} in prominence, and which also had "sufficient topographical merit" that he outlined in a complex formula.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hill-bagging.co.uk/Donalds.php|title=The Donalds and  Donald Tops|date=2018|publisher=HillBaggingUK|quote=The Donalds are named after Percy Donald and his list of hills over 2000 feet in the Scottish Lowlands.  They are based on a complicated formula for determining separate hills, and originally comprised 87 hills plus a number of other named "Tops".}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="munros"/&gt;  

This formula splits Donald's into '''Donald Hills''' and '''Donald Tops'''.  The SMC define Donald Tops as: "elevations in the Scottish Lowlands of at least 2000ft (610m) in height with a drop of at least 50ft (15.2m) between each elevation and any higher elevation. Further, elevations separated from higher elevations by a drop of less than 100ft (30.5m) are required to have "sufficient topographical merit".  In addition, the SMC define Donald Hills as being: "defined from Donald Tops, where a Hill is the highest Top with a separation of 17 units or less. A unit is either one-twelfth of a mile along a Top's connecting ridge or 50ft (30.5m) in elevation between the Top and its connecting bealach/col. The separation is the sum of these two measures."&lt;ref name="smc"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.smc.org.uk/hills/hill-lists#Donalds|title=Donalds|publisher=[[Scottish Mountaineering Club]]|date=2018|quote=There are currently 89 Donald Hills and a further 51 Donald Tops.

For Munro Tops the hierarchy is shown in Munro's Tables. For a few tops the parent is topographically incorrect on current mapping (i.e. not the hill linked by the highest col), e.g. the SMC parent of 527 Carn Lochan is Cairn Gorm rather than Ben Macdui, the parent of 1015 Stob Cadha Gobhlach is Sgurr Fiona instead of Bidein a' Ghlas Thuill, and the parent of 811 Ciste Dhubh is Mam Sodhail not Carn Eighe.  For Donald Tops the 1953, 1969 and 1974 editions of Munro's Tables show the hierarchy correctly but later editions do not. For example, hill 1652 Ben Ever is a top of Ben Cleuch but from 1981 onwards is shown underneath Blairdenon Hill, and hill 1897 Coomb Dodd is shown above rather than below its parent Hillshaw Head. Parents of former Section 13—Appendix hills and the Glen Artney hills that entered the Tables in 1997 have been assigned by us."}}

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14924">This is a '''list of Orkney islands''' in [[Scotland]]. The [[Orkney]] [[archipelago]] is located {{convert|16|km|mi}} north of mainland [[Scotland]] and comprises over 70 islands and [[skerry|skerries]], of which 20 are permanently inhabited. In addition to the [[Mainland, Orkney|Orkney Mainland]] there are three groups of islands. The North and South Isles lie respectively north and south of Mainland. The [[Pentland Skerries]] are a group of small islands in the [[Pentland Firth]], a dangerous stretch of water between mainland Scotland and the larger islands of Orkney, through which run the strongest tidal streams in Britain.&lt;ref&gt;Lawrence, Martin (2003) ''The Yachtsman's Pilot: North and East Scotland''. St Ives. Imray, Laurie, Norie and Wilson, p. 108.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Stroma, Scotland|The Isle of Stroma]] is often mistakenly included with the Orkney Islands, but is part of [[Caithness]].

The definition of an island used in this list is that it is 'land that is surrounded by seawater on a daily basis, but not necessarily at all stages of the tide, excluding human devices such as bridges and causeways'.&lt;ref&gt;Various other definitions are used in the Scottish context. For example the General Register Office for Scotland defined an island as 'a mass of land surrounded by water, separate from the Scottish mainland' but although they included islands linked by bridges etc. this is not clear from this definition. Haswell-Smith (2004) uses "an Island is a piece of land or group of pieces of land which is entirely surrounded by water at Lowest Astronomical Tide and to which there is no permanent means of dry access". This is widely agreed to be unhelpful as it consciously excludes bridged islands.&lt;/ref&gt; There are four islands joined to the Orkney Mainland by a series of [[causeway]]s known as the [[Churchill Barriers]]. They are [[South Ronaldsay]], [[Burray]], [[Lamb Holm]] and [[Glims Holm]]. In addition, [[Hunda]] is connected to Burray by a causeway.&lt;ref&gt;Ordnance Survey maps call Glims Holm 'Glimps Holm'. Lamb Holm and Glims Holm are also occasionally referred to as 'Lambholm' and 'Glimsholm'. See for example Wenham, Sheena "The South Isles", in Omand (2003) p. 210.&lt;/ref&gt; The barriers were constructed by Italian [[prisoners-of-war]] as a means of preventing enemy [[submarine]] access to the vast natural harbour of [[Scapa Flow]] after the sinking of [[HMS Royal Oak (08)|HMS ''Royal Oak'']] by a [[Germany|German]] [[U-boat]] in 1939 with the loss of 883 lives. The Italian prisoners constructed a small [[Roman Catholic]] [[Italian Chapel|chapel]] on Lamb Holm as a place of worship during their incarceration.&lt;ref&gt;Wenham, Sheena "Modern Times" in Omand (2003) pp. 108-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most of the islands have a bedrock formed from [[Old Red Sandstone]], which is about 400 million years old, and was laid down in the [[Devonian]] period.&lt;ref&gt;McKirdy, Alan Gordon, John &amp; Crofts, Roger (2007) ''Land of Mountain and Flood: The Geology and Landforms of Scotland''. Edinburgh. Birlinn.&lt;/ref&gt; The islands have good agricultural qualities and have been continuously inhabited for thousands of years,&lt;ref&gt;[http://walking.visitscotland.com/walks/orkneyshetland/ "Walk in Scotland: Orkney and Shetland"] Visit Scotland. Retrieved 15 July 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; as evidenced by the [[World Heritage Site]] of the [[Heart of Neolithic Orkney]]. The archipelago is exposed to wind and tide, and there are numerous [[lighthouse]]s as an aid to navigation.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nlb.org.uk/LighthouseLibrary/Main/ "Lighthouse Library"] Northern Lighthouse Board. Retrieved 1 May 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; The European Marine Energy Centre, which is located at [[Stromness]], is currently testing various [[wave power|wave]] and [[tidal energy]] devices from Billia Croo on the Mainland and [[Eday]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emec.org.uk/ "EMEC Orkney"] European Marine Energy Centre. Retrieved 3 February 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; The islands all fall within the [[Orkney|Orkney Islands Council]] area. Most of the larger islands have [[development trust]]s that support the local economy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.dtascot.org.uk/content/directory-of-members "Directory of Members'] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20100719214140/http://www.dtascot.org.uk/content/directory-of-members |date=2010-07-19 }} DTA Scotland.

Retrieved 15 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The total population of Orkney increased from 19,245 in 2001 to 21,349 at the time of the [[United Kingdom Census 2011|2011 census]].&lt;ref name=NRS/&gt;

==Main list==
[[Image:Orkney Ward Hill.jpg|thumb|right|[[Ward Hill, Hoy|Ward Hill]], [[Hoy]]]]
This is a list of islands with an area greater than 15 hectares (approximately 37 acres). Records for the last date of settlement for the smaller uninhabited islands are incomplete, but all of the islands listed here would have been inhabited at some point during the [[Neolithic]], [[Picts|Pictish]] or [[Viking|Norse]] periods.  

'Ward Hill' or a variant thereof is very common as the name of the highest point on the island. These locations are named after those high places used for the lighting of [[beacon|warning beacons]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orkneyjar.com/placenames/pl-root.htm "Orkney Placenames - natural elements"] Orkneyjar.

The population of the tidal islet of Holm of Grimbister was not recorded by the 2001 census,&lt;ref name=GRO&gt;General Register Office for Scotland (2003)&lt;/ref&gt; although it was inhabited in 2010 and probably earlier.&lt;ref&gt;Ross, Calum (3 Mar 2010) [http://www.pressandjournal.co.uk/Article.aspx/1668686 "Tory candidate pulls out of race for city seat at general election"]. ''Press and Journal''. Aberdeen. Retrieved 26 Feb 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; It did appear in the 2011 tables.&lt;ref name=NRS/&gt;

The population of Inner Holm in 2001 was one, although the figure was included in the total for Mainland at the time of the 2001 census.&lt;ref name=NRS/&gt;

Lamb Holm is "included in the NRS statistical geography for inhabited islands but had no usual residents at the time of either the 2001 or 2011 censuses".&lt;ref name=NRS/&gt; 

Papa Stronsay had usually resident population of 10 in 2001&lt;ref name=GRO/&gt; but was apparently not permanently inhabited in 2011.&lt;ref name=NRS/&gt;

'''Locata Corporation''' is a privately held technology company headquartered in [[Canberra]], [[Australia]], with a fully owned subsidiary in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]]. Locata has invented a [[local positioning system]] that can either replace or augment [[Global Positioning System]] (GPS) signals when they are blocked, jammed or unreliable. Government, commercial and other organizations use Locata to determine accurate positioning as a local backup to GPS.

==History==
David Small and Nunzio Gambale started work on the initial Locata concepts in 1994 and founded Locata as a company in 1997. As of December 2013, the company has been granted 122 [[patent]]s around their positioning technology.

==Products==

===LocataNet===
A LocataNet is a ground-based local positioning system that provides positioning information which is indistinguishable from [[GPS]] to an appropriately configured receiver.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidegnss.com/node/3071|] ''[[Inside GNSS]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The LocataNet achieves this without the satellites, atomic clocks or ground support structure required by traditional GPS satellite-based systems.

To create a LocataNet, LocataLite radio [[transceivers]] are deployed around a defined area. These devices collectively function like &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/communications/38163/?p1=MstRcnt|] MIT Technology Review&lt;/ref&gt; a grounded version of a GPS satellite constellation, transmitting radiolocation signals that Locata receivers use to generate a positioning solution, outputting [[latitude]], [[longitude]] and [[altitude]], using trilateration in the same way as a traditional GPS receiver. LocataLites can be designed to transmit at any practical frequency or power level. The first commercially deployed designs operate in the same [[ISM band]] as [[Wi-Fi]], and each LocataLite generally covers an area of up to 10 kilometers in radius in open environments.

LocataNets provide all of the Position, Navigation and Time (PNT) functions provided by a GPS satellite constellation, but in a local area, such as an open-cut mine, harbor, military range or other area. This allows operators to set up controlled positioning networks to locate, automate and direct objects with centimeter-level accuracy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.gpsworld.com/survey/locata-a-new-constellation-12031?page_id=2|] GPS World&lt;/ref&gt; Locata’s duplication of PNT is made possible by the company's patented nanosecond-accurate TimeLoc synchronization technology.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidegnss.com/node/2777/] ''[[Inside GNSS]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

==VRay==
The VRay is an 80-element spherical antenna that provides precise positioning in dense urban environments and indoors where traditional GNSS receivers are susceptible to large multipath errors.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/news/519811/a-cure-for-urban-gps-a-3-d-antenna/] MIT Technology Review&lt;/ref&gt; By switching on each element for just over one microsecond, the VRay correlator design in a Locata receiver creates virtual beams which mitigate multipath effects by focusing on the direct received signal and filtering out multipath bounces. Because the VRay can sweep many beams simultaneously around an area it also determines the angle and strength of received signals and this information is used to derive the precise 3D attitude of the receiver platform as well.

In a partnership with the U.S. Air Force Institute of Technology (AFIT), the VRay is being developed for use with GPS receivers as part of a Co-operative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) signed in April 2013.&lt;ref&gt;[http://gpsworld.com/afit-locata-partner-on-gps-tech-development/] GPS World&lt;/ref&gt; AFIT will design and test several GPS-based variants of Locata-patented antenna and correlator technology to develop the VRay for military GPS use cases.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spatialsource.com.au/2013/09/17/usaf-institute-of-technology-signs-agreement-with-locata/] Spatial Source&lt;/ref&gt;

==Partners==
[[Hexagon AB|Hexagon]], provider of design, measurement and visualization technologies, is the first company to integrate Locata's terrestrial technology within their Leica Geosystems subsidiary's [[GPS]]-[[GLONASS]]-[[Galileo (satellite navigation)|Galileo]]-BeiDou receivers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amerisurv.com/content/view/10783/] American Surveyor&lt;/ref&gt;

==Deployments==

===Military===
Locata has been awarded a multi-year sole-source contract &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidegnss.com/node/2777#|] ''[[Inside GNSS]]''&lt;/ref&gt; with the [[United States Air Force]] 746th Test Squadron (746 TS) to deploy a LocataNet and provide positioning information when GPS is jammed across a 2,500 square mile area of the [[White Sands Missile Range]] in [[New Mexico]]. TMC Design, a certified Locata Technology Integrator (LTI) has been let the contract to design, integrate, install and test Locata’s Non-GPS Based Positioning System (NGBPS) at the White Sands Missile Range location.&lt;ref&gt;[https://online.wsj.com/article/PR-CO-20130611-904739.html] The Wall Street Journal&lt;/ref&gt;

Before the contract was granted, the USAF proved through independent testing that the LocataNet delivers accuracy of eight inches or less to aircraft up to 35 miles away.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg21728985.600-new-positioning-technology-could-compete-with-gps.html|] New Scientist&lt;/ref&gt; Locata's NGBPS system will provide the 746 TS with enhanced validation capabilities in GPS denied environments while operating mobile and airborne position, navigation and timing (PNT) equipment and navigation warfare (NAVWAR) systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.airforce-technology.com/news/newsusaf-contracts-tmc-design-for-locata-ngbps-installation] Airforce Technology&lt;/ref&gt;

Locata is the core component for the USAF's Ultra High Accuracy Reference System (UHARS) which will be deployed at White Sands in 2014 to improve performance of military systems in GPS-denied environments. UHARS is described by the USAF as the new "gold standard truth system for the increasingly demanding test and evaluation of future navigation and navigation warfare systems for the U.S. Department of Defense".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidegnss.com/node/3071] ''[[Inside GNSS]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mining===
In partnership with [[Leica Geosystems]], the first commercial LocataNet is deployed at [[Newmont Mining Corporation|Newmont’s]] [[Boddington Gold Mine]] (BGM) in [[Western Australia]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.technologyreview.com/communications/38163/?p1=MstRcnt/|] MIT Technology Review&lt;/ref&gt; In this environment, Locata’s technology provides positioning for automation of mining machines as the pit gets deeper and traditional satellite-based GPS coverage becomes unreliable because fewer satellites are in view in the pit, particularly near the mine’s pit walls.

===Automotive===
The Insurance Institute for Highway Safety (IIHS), in partnership with Perrone Robotics,&lt;ref&gt;[http://gpsworld.com/locata-positioning-to-underpin-crash-avoidance-research/] GPS World&lt;/ref&gt; in December 2013 completed the installation of phase 1 of a two-stage Locata network as the first portion of a $30 million upgrade to the Vehicle Research Center (VRC). Locata is the sole-source of positioning information for the precision robotics control required by the VRC for the U.S. testing of next-generation vehicle collision avoidance systems.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.insidegnss.com/node/3526] ''[[Inside GNSS]]''&lt;/ref&gt; As part of the upgrade, VRC researchers are installing new robotic and high-precision positioning technology for both their outdoor track and 300-by-700 foot indoor testing area.

The following [[Outline (list)|outline]] is provided as an overview of and topical guide to Kenya:

'''[[Kenya]]''' is a country in East Africa. The capital city is [[Nairobi]], 2nd largest in Africa (after [[Cairo, Egypt|Cairo]]). Kenya spans an area about 85% the size of France or Texas. The population has grown rapidly in recent decades to roughly 38 million. Kenya has numerous wildlife reserves, containing thousands of animal species. The country is named after [[Mount Kenya]], a significant landmark and the second among the [[highest mountain peaks of Africa]],&lt;ref name=times_kenya_colony&gt;{{Cite newspaper The Times|articlename=British East Africa Annexed--"Kenya Colony"

'''Pacific Environment''' is an environmental organization based in [[San Francisco]], [[California]], United States, founded in 1987. Its objective is to protect the living environment of the [[Pacific Rim]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacificenvironment.org/article.php?id=58 Pacific Environment : Our Mission&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

The organization was founded 1987 as Pacific Energy and Resources Center. In 1991, Pacific Environment became the first international organization to bring widespread attention to the threats facing the [[Siberian]] [[taiga]], beginning a long history of work in Russia. In 1993, a Pacific Environment campaign with Russian partners led to the creation of the Botchi [[Nature Reserve]], protecting valuable forests in the Russian Far East that were to be logged by [[Weyerhaeuser]] Corporation. That same year, Pacific Environment worked with the [[Udege people]] in the Russian Far East to protect the three-million-acre (1.2-million-hectare) upper Bikin Watershed against logging by the [[Hyundai|Hyundai Corporation]]. This area is now a wildlife refuge.

By the mid-1990s, they began to focus on the linchpin financial role international institutions were playing in resource extraction in Russia and initiated a long-term effort to link grassroots environmentalists around the Pacific Rim to international policy decisions, particularly those of government-supported [[Export credit agency|export credit agencies]]. Pacific Environment pioneered efforts to block the financing of destructive projects and improve others as one of the founding members of an international campaign to reform the social and environmental policies of export credit agencies, in a program dubbed ECA Watch. While Pacific Environment's biggest successes in the 1990s were in Russia, they also began to focus more broadly on the Pacific Rim.

In China, Pacific Environment took advantage of the growing opportunities to partner with that country's emerging environmental movement by helping dozens of local groups become more effective watchdogs of local government, especially through the media. They also assisted these groups in encouraging the Chinese government to review environmental impacts. Pacific Environment's partners at Greener Beijing utilized the internet to organize a campaign against consumption of turtle and tortoise species in the [[Hainan Province]]. After a government investigation prompted in part by the campaign, the Hainan Yang Sheng Tan Company halted its import of turtle and tortoise species after financial losses and public pressure. And in 2004, Chinese Premiere Wen Jiabao ordered officials to reconsider plans for a dam along the [[Nu River]], after journalists and environmentalists teamed up to spotlight the issue.

==Organisation==
Pacific Environment employs 16 employees located throughout the Pacific Rim with offices in San Francisco, California; Anchorage, Alaska; Washington DC; and Beijing, China. The reported operating budget for the 2011–2012 fiscal year was $2.4 million,&lt;ref name=GuideStar&gt;{{cite web|title=Annual Revenue &amp; Expenses|url=http://www.guidestar.org/organizations/94-2628924/pacificnt-resources-center.aspx|publisher=GuideStar|accessdate=2013-09-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;  with the majority of that coming from foundations.&lt;br /&gt; 

Pacific Environment splits its activities between five main programs the Russia Program, China Program, Alaska Program, California Energy Program, and Responsible Finance Program.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.pacificenvironment.org/article.php?list=type&amp;type=7 Pacific Environment : Our Programs&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070608022138/http://www.pacificenvironment.org/article.php?list=type&amp;type=7 |date=2007-06-08 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Programs==
Pacific Environment takes on specific challenges in key geographic areas throughout the Pacific Rim, and employs key international leverage points to bolster local campaigns. They engage in five major areas of focus outlined below.

===Russia===
For the past 20 years, Pacific Environment has partnered with Russian environmentalists to ensure the peoples in these regions have a voice in decisions that impact their environment, health and livelihoods. Pacific Environment works alongside Russian and international [[non-profit organization|nonprofits]] to protect wild lands and wildlife, promote responsible fisheries management, and advocate environmental controls on oil, gas and minerals development.

Pacific Environment’s Russia Program has five key campaigns:
# Opposing Oil and gas development on [[Sakhalin Island]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.environmental-finance.com/onlinews/2007sak.htm Environmental Finance Online News&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070928081913/http://www.environmental-finance.com/onlinews/2007sak.htm |date=2007-09-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Siberia Pacific Pipeline
# Preserving the natural habitat in [[Kamchatka]] against [[illegal fishing]], predatory mining, and oil and gas drilling
# Opposing the construction of a dam and pipeline in the [[Altai Mountains|Altai]] region
# Monitoring and restricting [[mining]]

===China===
Pacific Environment enhances the Chinese environmental movement by:
# providing partners renewed financial support to hire and retain staff enhancing both their professional capacity and efficacy in accomplishing their advocacy and civil society goals.
# organizing a network for partners to share experiences and information relevant to their water pollution work through biannual workshops and regular consultation with each other and with Pacific Environment
# assisting partners in developing communications strategies that will enable them to generate media attention on local efforts to fight water pollution.

===Alaska===
Pacific Environment’s Alaska Program partners with native, fishing, environmental, and scientific communities to confront cultural and environmental threats to [[Alaska]] and the surrounding waters. These partnerships focus on safeguarding critical habitats, including the world's largest [[salmon run]], the feeding grounds of the endangered northeastern Pacific [[right whale]], old-growth seafloor habitat, and areas essential to community subsistence. The three key campaign goals are:
# Prevent all offshore oil and gas exploration and drilling in [[Bristol Bay]] and the [[Beaufort Sea|Beaufort]] and [[Chukchi Sea]]s
# Dramatically increase shipping safety response and prevention plans along the [[Great Circle Route]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.adn.com/news/alaska/story/8016271p-7909205c.html adn.com | alaska : Ship tracks closer to Aleutians&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060813211034/http://www.adn.com/news/alaska/story/8016271p-7909205c.html |date=2006-08-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;
# Facilitate an international coalition of stakeholders to protect the unique biodiversity of the [[Bering Sea]]

===California Energy===
Pacific Environment's California energy program works to maintain [[California]]'s commitment to clean energy and reducing [[greenhouse gas]]es by:
# Keeping [[liquefied natural gas]] out of the West Coast
# Promoting Community Choice, a plan that would allow [[San Francisco]] and the East Bay cities of Oakland, [[Emeryville, California|Emeryville]], and [[Berkeley, California|Berkeley]] to buy up to 50% of their cities' electricity from [[off-grid]] [[renewable energy|renewable]] sources
# Retrofitting aging, polluting power plants to increase energy efficiency and reduce overall energy demands

===Responsible Finance===
Pacific Environment’s Responsible Finance Campaign promotes environmentally and [[social responsibility|socially sustainable]] policies and practices among public and private finance institutions with interests and projects in less wealthy countries. With a principal focus on the extractive sector (oil, gas, mining, and forestry) operating on the Pacific Rim, Pacific Environment works to persuade these lending institutions to be more open, accountable, and responsive to citizens’ concerns, particularly in project-affected communities.

The international campaign to reform the policies and practices of public and private banks has expanded its focus to include multilateral development banks, export credit agencies, and large private international banks. After a decade of campaigning, a basic environmental policy framework is now in place for each of the three classes of institutions. However, proper implementation of these policies has become a vexing challenge especially in countries like Japan, where banks are playing an increasingly proactive role in fulfilling national security goals to obtain extractive and energy resources.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="4481">'''The Surface Energy Balance Algorithm for Land (SEBAL)''' uses the [['''surface''' energy balance]] to estimate aspects of the hydrological cycle. SEBAL maps [[evapotranspiration]], [[biomass]] growth, water deficit and [[soil moisture]]. Its main creator is Prof. Dr. W.G.M. Bastiaanssen &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://trapeze.gsfc.nasa.gov/pdf_archive/soc_0011.pdf|title=Precious Resources: Water and Landsat’s Thermal Band|publisher=NASA|accessdate=2010-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Model background ==

The basis of SEBAL is the energy balance:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.fao.org/docrep/x0490e/x0490e00.htm|title=FAO Irrigation and Drainage Paper No. 56. Crop Evapotranspiration (guidelines for computing crop water requirements)|date=1998|publisher=Food and agricultural organization|accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; the energy driving the hydrological cycle is equal to the incoming energy minus:

#the energy going to heating of the soil and air, and
#the energy reflected back to space.

SEBAL quantifies the energy balance using satellite data as an input.&lt;ref&gt;Irmak (Kilic), A., R.G. Allen, J. Kjaersgaard, J. Huntington, B. Kamble, R. Trezza, and I. Ratcliffe.  2012.  Operational Remote Sensing of ET and Challenges.  Chapter 21 in Evapotranspiration – Remote Sensing and Modeling (A. Irmak (Kilic), editor),  Publisher: InTech. {{cite web|url=http://www.intechopen.com/books/evapotranspiration-remote-sensing-and-modeling|title=Evapotranspiration - Remote Sensing and Modeling|publisher=Intech|accessdate=2015-02-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Land surface characteristics such as surface [[albedo]], [[leaf area index]], [[NDVI|vegetation index]] and surface temperature are derived from satellite imagery. In addition to [[Remote sensing|satellite images]], the SEBAL model requires [[Meteorology|meteorological data]], such as [[wind speed]], [[humidity]], [[solar radiation]] and air temperature. It uses meteorological data from the moment of the recording of the satellite data to solve the 'instantaneous' energy balance, and uses extrapolation to calculate daily evapotranspiration. Using a time series of satellite and meteorological data, periodic cumulative (e.g. weekly, monthly, yearly) evapotranspiration data can be calculated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.waterwatch.nl/fileadmin/bestanden/Tools/A_scientific_description_of_SEBAL_procedure.pdf|title=A scientific description of SEBAL procedure|publisher=WaterWatch|accessdate=2010-04-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The SEBAL model uses the energy balance, as opposed to in hydrology common [[water balance]] to solve for evapotranspiration.

== Applications ==
The energy balance applies to all scales, ranging from global to river basin to region to farm and to field level. Satellite images come in a wide variety of spatial and temporal resolutions.

The '''Scott Polar Research Institute''' ('''SPRI''') is a centre for research into the [[polar region]]s and [[glaciology]] worldwide. It is a sub-department of the [[Department of Geography, University of Cambridge|Department of Geography]] in the [[University of Cambridge]], located on [[Lensfield Road]] in the south of [[Cambridge]] ({{coord|52|11|54.40|N|0|07|34.45|E}}).

==Purpose==
[[File:Bust Scott Geograph-1422431-by-Keith-Edkins.jpg|left|thumb|upright|Bust of [[Robert Falcon Scott]] by [[Kathleen Scott]]]]
[[File:Youth-lawrence-cambridge-2017.jpg|thumb|upright|right|The statue of 'Youth' (1920) by Kathleen Scott for which [[A. W. Lawrence]] was the model]]
SPRI was founded by [[Frank Debenham]] in 1920 as the national memorial to Captain [[Robert Falcon Scott]] and his companions, who died on their return journey from the [[South Pole]] in 1912. It investigates issues relevant to the [[Arctic]] and [[Antarctic]] in the [[environmental science]]s, [[social sciences]] and [[humanities]]. The institute has some 60 personnel, consisting of academic, library and support staff plus postgraduate students, associates and fellows attached to research programmes.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/ Welcome to SPRI] Scott Polar Research Institute. Accessed 28 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

The institute also hosts the [[Scientific Committee on Antarctic Research]], and is part of the [[Natural Environment Research Council|NERC]] Centre for Polar Observation and Modelling.

==Resources==
The Grade II listed main building  (1933–34) is by [[Sir Herbert Baker]]. The  small halls have shallow domed ceilings painted with the aspect of the globe from north and south poles, by [[MacDonald Gill]].&lt;ref name="NHLE"&gt;{{National Heritage List for England entry| num=1268369 |desc=Scott Polar Research Institute |grade=II |accessdate=29 December 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
The Scott Polar Research Institute houses the world's most comprehensive polar library and archives.&lt;ref name= "SPRI website"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/library/overview.html|title=Scott Polar Research Institute, Cambridge » Library|author=|date=|website=www.spri.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute's [[Thomas Henry Manning|Thomas H. Manning]] Archive contains an unparalleled collection of manuscript material relating to the polar regions, research and exploration. For scientists and scholars, the library offers a collection developed since the 1920s covering all subjects relating to the Arctic, the Antarctic, and to ice and snow wherever found. For industry, it is a prime information source on such subjects as exploration and exploitation of natural resources and on the environmental implications of such activities in the polar regions; on the design of ice-strengthened shipping and selection of sea routes; and on problems of construction and transportation in cold environments. The library also offers an unrivalled resource for the needs of international relations and strategic defence.

The Picture Library contains a photograph collection from both the Arctic and Antarctic, mainly depicting the history of exploration in the polar regions, including much material from the expeditions of Scott and Shackleton. Its [[Thomas Henry Manning|Thomas H. Manning]] Polar Archives are named in honour of the British-Canadian Arctic researcher, a university alumnus.&lt;ref name="nytimes"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1998/11/25/world/thomas-manning-86-explorer-known-as-lone-wolf-of-arctic.html|title=Thomas Manning, 86, Explorer Known as Lone Wolf of Arctic|last=Kaufman|first=Michael T.|date=25 November 1998|publisher=''[[The New York Times]]''|accessdate=20 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its work includes an [[oral history]] programme which interviews people who have worked in the polar regions over the years. Due to high demand, the Polar Archives runs a booking scheme for anyone wishing to consult material.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/library/archives/|title=Scott Polar Research Institute, Cambridge » Polar Archives|author=|date=|website=www.spri.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The most recent addition to the library is the [[Ernest Shackleton|Shackleton]] Memorial Library, which in 1999 won a regional award from the [[Royal Institute of British Architects]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/library/building/ The Shackleton Memorial Library] Scott Polar Research Institute. Accessed 28 December 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; This part of the building holds much of the library's Antarctic collection, as well as some of its subject-based material.

The library is part of the Inspire Libraries scheme&lt;ref&gt;http://inspire-libraries.org.uk/participating-libraries/?task=view&amp;id=1558&lt;/ref&gt; and is open to anyone with a polar interest to use for reference work and research.

The Institute is actively adding to its collection of contemporary polar art through its artist in residence scheme, managed by the Friends of SPRI, which enables an artist to travel to the Antarctic and the Arctic each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Artists in Residence|url=https://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/friends/artistinresidence/|website=Scott Polar Research Institute|publisher=Scott Polar Research Institute, University of Cambridge|accessdate=2 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As well as permanent exhibits, the museum regularly hosts special exhibitions. The museum is open Tuesdays to Saturdays, 10:00 – 16:00, and admission is free.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.spri.cam.ac.uk/museum/ Museum] Polar Museum. Accessed 9 June 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

The museum is one of the eight museums and botanic garden which make up the [[University of Cambridge Museums]] consortium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/museums-and-collections/visit-us/our-museums|title=Our Museums|first=Jo|last=McPhee|date=6 August 2013|website=www.cam.ac.uk|accessdate=14 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Research==
SPRI has several research groups.

===Glaciology and Climate Change Group===
This group's work involves quantifying the state of the [[cryosphere]] using remote sensing by satellites, plus accurate field measurements and computer simulations, to understand the processes in detail. In particular, the group has been able to observe the melting of the [[Larsen Ice Shelf]], the rapid retreat of ice in western Antarctica, and increased summer melting in northern Canada. This work has contributed greatly to understanding [[global warming|climate change]].

===Glacimarine Environments Group===
This group's work focuses on the dynamics of ice-sheets and delivery of sediment to the marine environment. The group uses geophysical and geological evidence gathered by [[icebreaker]]s in the polar seas.

===Polar Landscape and Remote Sensing Group===
This group's work focuses on the processes which modify the polar and sub-polar environments, such as Arctic vegetation, and snow and ice cover. Improving techniques for measuring vegetation from satellite data is an important part of the work.

===Polar Social Science and Humanities Group===
This is an interdisciplinary group covering the anthropology, history and art of the Arctic. Its work includes looking at politics and environmental management in the polar regions, with particular expertise in the religion, culture and politics of the [[Russia]]n North.

'''Toni Hagen''' (17 August 1917 in [[Luzern]] – 18 April 2003 in [[Lenzerheide]]) was a [[Switzerland|Swiss]] [[geologist]] and a pioneer of Swiss [[development assistance]]. 

==Education==
After taking a diploma in engineering and geology from the Swiss Federal Institute of Technology in Zurich, he took a doctorate in the geology of the Welsh mountains and then became a research assistant at the Zurich Geological Institute.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1428276/Toni-Hagen.html&lt;/ref&gt;  

Hagen first visited [[Nepal]] in 1950 with a first Swiss development assistance mission. In 1952 he was employed by the government of Nepal and also worked for the [[United Nations]]. He explored the geography of that [[Himalaya]]n state. 

==Career==
Dr. Hagen was the first foreigner to trek throughout Nepal during geological and geographic survey work and mapping on behalf of the United Nations. He clocked over 14,000&amp;nbsp;km walking several times across Nepal, where the topography is mostly hilly to snow-covered. He filmed Nepalese cultural and ethnic diversity originally as produced as a silent documentary, and later with an English narration in his own voice.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ywjbOXIixaE&lt;/ref&gt; Dr. Hagen is also the author of several books including a book entitled ''Nepal'' ({{ISBN|99933 13 03 3}}; LCCN 99937099) &lt;ref&gt;http://himalbooks.com/shop/products/Toni-Hagen%E2%80%99s-Nepal:-The-Kingdom-in-the-Himalaya.html&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://lccn.loc.gov/99937099&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1966 to 1971, as adviser to the UN's Development Program, he was given a special mission in crisis-hit areas worldwide including Africa, the Middle East and Asia.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1428276/Toni-Hagen.html&lt;/ref&gt; Hagen was a pioneer in the field of development aid, undertaking missions to the Himalayas, eastern Africa and South America in a career spanning over 60 years.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/index.html?siteSect=105&amp;sid=1779125&lt;/ref&gt;

After [[Tibet]] was taken over by [[China]] in 1959, Hagen used his influence to help the Tibetan refugees. During the next years he gained [[Dalai Lama]]'s confidence. He managed to bring approximately 1,000–1,500 Tibetans to Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/index.html?siteSect=105&amp;sid=1779125&lt;/ref&gt; 

Hagen retired from the UN in 1972, worked as a freelance adviser for organisations involved in foreign aid and later returned to the Federal Institute of Technology at Zurich where he lectured on the problems of the developing world. In the early 1980s he established the Toni Hagen Foundation in Switzerland and Nepal to promote democratic reforms and better understanding between different ethnic groups in Nepal.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1428276/Toni-Hagen.html&lt;/ref&gt;

==Film Production==
In 1999 Dr. Toni Hagen filmed a story of his life, ''The Ring of the Buddha'' (German title: ''Der Ring des Buddha''), which also included some original materials from the 1960s. Soon after the film was shown, he died in early 2003 at the age of 85 in his home in Lucerne&lt;ref&gt;http://nepalitimes.com/news.php?id=19173&lt;/ref&gt; on Good Friday, three days after his wife,&lt;ref&gt;https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/1428276/Toni-Hagen.html&lt;/ref&gt; Gertrud in Lenzerheide.

The '''Wa States''' was the name formerly given to the '''Wa Land''', the [[natural region|natural]] and [[historical region]] inhabited mainly by the [[Wa people]], an ethnic group speaking an [[Austroasiatic languages|Austroasiatic language]]. The region is located to the northeast of the [[Shan States]] of [[British rule in Burma|British Burma]], in the area of present-day [[Shan State]] of northern [[Burma]] (Myanmar) and the western zone of [[Pu'er Prefecture]], [[Yunnan]], [[China]].

Practically the whole Wa region is rugged [[mountainous]] territory with steep hills and deep valleys. There were no urban areas. A section of the historical Wa territory was included in the state of [[Manglon]], one of the Shan States. Sir [[James George Scott]] visited the Wa States around the turn of the century and wrote about the place, taking pictures of the people and the houses of the area as well.&lt;ref name="JGS"/&gt; Considered a distant and inaccessible border area by former empires, the British census of 1901 did not include the Wa States, so statistics regarding a population over 50,000 in 1911 are estimates.&lt;ref name="IGI"&gt;[http://dsal.uchicago.edu/reference/gazetteer/pager.html?objectid=DS405.1.I34_V24_350.gif Imperial Gazetteer of India, v. 24, p. 344.]&lt;/ref&gt; 

The oral tradition of the Wa people claims that their territory had been much larger in the distant past,&lt;ref name="DM"&gt;Donald M. Seekins, ''Historical Dictionary of Burma (Myanmar)'', p. 251&lt;/ref&gt; an assertion that is confirmed both by [[Shan people|Shan]] and Yunnan Chinese sources.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Pierre-Arnaud Chouvy, ''Opium: Uncovering the Politics of the Poppy'', Harvard University Press. p. 44&lt;/ref&gt; The Wa also regard their ancestral territory as being at the centre of the inhabited world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://newdoc.nccu.edu.tw/teasyllabus/113721265905/Fiskesjo%20on%20Fortified%20Villages.pdf M. Fiskesjo, ''On the Ethnoarchaeology of Fortified Settlements in the Northern part of Mainland Southeast Asia'']&lt;/ref&gt; Nowadays part of the area of the former Wa States is included in [[Wa State]], an unrecognised state within Burma.

==History==

===Ancient lore===
There are no historical records on the Wa States before the 19th century.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt; [[Northern Thailand|Northern Thai]] legends claim that before the advent of [[Buddhism]] the [[Lanna]] territory was founded by nine Wa clans.&lt;ref&gt;Cholthira Satyawadhna (1990). "Structure and Contradiction in the Austro-Asiatic System". In Gehan Wijeyewardene. ''Ethnic Groups Across National Boundaries in Mainland Southeast Asia''. Singapore: Institute of Southeast Asian Studies. p. 90. {{ISBN|981-3035-57-9}}. "While in northern Thailand it was believed that Lanna was established by nine Wa clans, this myth was told with the variation that there were nine sons, who established themselves in the nine Wa valleys, mostly in the west ... The ten daughters settled on the fells."&lt;/ref&gt; According to Wa [[oral tradition]] the area where they live, with the [[Nam Hka]] flowing across it, as well as the areas further to the south between the [[Mekong]] and the Salween down to [[Chiang Mai]], had been their ancestral territory since time immemorial.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/athousandmileso00hallgoog/athousandmileso00hallgoog_djvu.txt A thousand miles on an elephant in the Shan states]&lt;/ref&gt; This view is supported by remains of fortified towns on the hills now covered by jungle,&lt;ref name="JGS"/&gt; as well as by the traditions of the [[Shan people|Shan]], according to which the territory of [[Kengtung State]] further to the south had formerly belonged to the Wa people who were displaced around 1229 and were later defeated by King [[Mangrai]].&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt;

Around [[Kengtung]] there are dispersed groups related to the Wa, such as the Tai Loi, En, Piying and Hsen Hsum, living in small villages, likely remnants of the former Wa population.&lt;ref name="DM"/&gt; The [[Vingngun]] (Pakkatè, [[Shan language|Shan]]: ''Wiang Ngoen'') historical area of the Wa —where silver was said to have been worked— was included in the Wa States.&lt;ref&gt;[http://wenku.baidu.com/view/0a0d6bfcc8d376eeaeaa313c Wa Area Placenames_百度文库]&lt;/ref&gt;
By the 18th century, during [[Qing Dynasty]] rule in China, the Wa area became separated from the tribal military control of the [[Dai people]].

===19th century===
{{main|Pan Lon}}
In the 19th century the [[British government]] considered the region a remote territory and did not administer the Wa States.&lt;ref name="JGS"&gt;[[James George Scott|Sir J. George Scott]], ''Burma : a handbook of practical information''. London 1906, p.&lt;/ref&gt;  The only Wa territory administered by the British was the State of [[Manglon]], which was ruled by a Wa ''[[saopha]]'' and was populated mostly by Wa in the region that lay east of the [[Salween]]. The border with China was left undefined&lt;ref&gt;N Ganesan &amp; Kyaw Yin Hlaing eds. ''Myanmar: State, Society and Ethnicity''  Institute of Southeast Asian Studies, February 1, 2007, p. 269&lt;/ref&gt; and the area was left alone, officially belonging neither to [[China]] nor to [[Great Britain]]. Consequently, the Wa States were never fully incorporated into [[British Burma]].

The population of the Wa States included other ethnic groups such as the [[Tai Yai people|Tai Yai]], [[Lisu people|Lisu]] and [[Kachin people]]. There were also enclaves of [[Lahu people|Lahu]] at Mongkha and [[Shan people|Lao Shan]] in Mongshaw within Wa territory.&lt;ref name="IGI"/&gt; 

The inhabitants of the Wa States were traditionally [[animistic]]. But by the 19th century a minority of the Wa had been influenced by the [[Buddhist]] doctrine of the neighbouring Shan people, although mostly only superficially. The Wa who abandoned their traditional animistic ways became known as the 'Tame Wa'.&lt;ref name="JGS"/&gt;

In the late 19th century the Wa ruler of Son Mu welcomed the [[Panthays#Early 20th century|Panthay]], a community of persecuted [[Hui Muslim]]s that had fled across the [[Nam Ting]] to settle in his territory. Initially the relations between the Muslim settlers and the Wa were good, for the Panthays had gained at [[Pan Long]] a safe base for their commercial operations out of reach from their Chinese persecutors. 
The Wa, on the other hand, expected to gain from the trade that the Muslims they had sheltered would generate in their new mountain abode. However, neither side trusted the other, and it was the more sophisticated Panthays who eventually profited most from the assistance they had been given. They carried out their commerce on [[mule]] caravans across the mountains, becoming skilled muleteers and seeing their trade in the Burma-Yunnan frontier region flourish. Sir Hugh Daly, British superintendent of the Northern Shan States, described the Panthay colony at Pan Long as 'powerful' during a visit to the Wa States in 1891. At that time there were between 300 and 400 houses in the place and it had become the largest settlement of Chinese Muslim expatriates in the region. The community owed its growth to a high birthrate and the intermarriage with women of Chinese and [[Shan people|Shan descent]]. Daly also commented that the Panthay muleteers were well-armed.&lt;ref name="TGT"/&gt;

===The Wa-Panthay War===
In the first fifty years of their presence in Wa territory the Hui Muslim settlers had gradually extended their influence from their base at [[Panlon]] over their Wa neighbours. Panlon became the most powerful community in the Wa States and this growth in power and prestige allowed the Panthay settlement to enjoy a great measure of autonomy. According to Sir George Scott most of the Panthays were Sunni Muslims of the Hanafi school of thought that traced their roots to [[Dali City|Dali]], [[Menghua]], [[Baishan]], [[Fengqing]] and [[Yuzhou, Henan|Yuxian]], and were all merchants, mule-owners and "Men of substance". They used both Chinese and Arabic names and were the ''de facto'' upholders of the law in the unadministered Wa State. By the early 20th century the Panthays had increased their economic and military control in the area to such an extent that the relations between the Muslim settlers and their Wa hosts turned sour.&lt;ref name="TGT"&gt;Andrew Forbes &amp; David Henley, ''Traders of the Golden Triangle,'' Cognoscenti Books, &lt;/ref&gt; 

Finally in 1926 the tensions erupted into the local "Wa-Panthay War" in which the Panthays at Pan Long would boast to a group of British visitors that ''"... neither the Chinese nor the British mean anything to us. It is we who rule here."''&lt;ref name="TGT"/&gt; The war lasted throughout 1926 and 1926 and eventually the less organized Wa were defeated by the Muslim traders.&lt;ref name="GEH"&gt;Harvey, G E, 1932 ''Wa precis'', Rangoon 1933&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite their victory the Panthay population of the Wa States declined from 1,517 (1,076 males and 441 females) in 1921&lt;ref&gt;[[1921 Census of India]]&lt;/ref&gt; to 1,106 (685 males and 421 females) according to the [[1931 Census of India]]. The reason was that the dominance of the Muslim Panthays in the trade of the Wa frontier region had begun to wane. Barely a decade after the Wa-Panthay War the construction of the [[Burma Road]] between [[Lashio]] and [[Kunming]] in 1937–38 further set back the traditional mule caravan trade in which the Hui Muslim settlers had specialized. Finally the exodus of thousands of [[Yunnanese]] refugees and [[National Revolutionary Army|Kuomintang troops]] following the [[Chinese Communist Revolution]] in 1949 brought a flood of predominantly non-Muslim [[Han Chinese]], but almost no Huis, to the area of the Wa States and Shan State. In the wake of these developments many Panthays left the Wa territories and chose to migrate to [[Northern Thailand]], where they became part of the community known as [[Chin Haw]].&lt;ref name="TGT"/&gt;

===Modernization of the Wa States===
[[Christian missionaries]] went into the Wa region in the early 20th century, reaching first the Burmese and later also the Chinese areas of Wa territory. [[William Marcus Young|William Young]], from [[Nebraska]], studied in depth the [[Wa language]] and was instrumental in putting it into writing using a script based on the [[Latin alphabet]]. The first publication in the Wa language, a compilation of Wa [[hymn]]s, was printed in 1933.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.humancomp.org/wadict/young_family.html The Young Family’s Work with the Wa People]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1940s, during the [[Chinese Civil War]], remnants of the Chinese [[National Revolutionary Army]] retreated to territory within Burma as the [[People's Liberation Army]] took over mainland China. Some troops remained in the area east of the [[Salween river]], where in later years Wa insurgent groups controlled the region with the support of the [[Communist Party of Burma]]. The Wa States were officially merged into the [[Shan State]] in [[Post-independence Burma, 1948–62|post-independent Burma]], but the administration of the Burmese government was not reaching the Wa region and the Shan nationalist armed groups left the area alone as well.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"&gt;Ronald D. Renard, ''The Wa Authority and Good Governance, 1989 – 2007''&lt;/ref&gt;

Some towns experienced a modern administration for the first time during local communist rule. Throughout that period [[opium]] cultivation and [[drug trafficking]] increased and the ancient Wa traditional life became disrupted. However, for the first time in history an administrative system that collected revenue and maintained a significant armed force, as well as a rudimentary infrastructure, ushered the Wa region into the modern era.&lt;ref name="ReferenceB"/&gt;

==States==
There were many historical Wa states, but there is hardly any information about them; some of the 'states' were little more than small villages and their surrounding territory. Usually these villages were roughly fortified and were built on hilltops or slopes.&lt;ref name="IGI"/&gt; Occasionally these small states formed confederations, but since the vision of the Wa was restricted to their immediate surroundings, these alliances were neither far-reaching nor long-lasting.&lt;ref name="JGS"/&gt;

A great number of the communities living in the mountain villages had difficulties regarding water supply. The Wa used to build ponds to collect water and a system of bamboo pipes that brought water from the surrounding hills.&lt;ref name="JGS"/&gt;

===States ruled by Saophas===
{{see also|Mang Lon|Panlong Subtownship}}
The saopha of [[Mang Lon]] was a Buddhist Wa. Besides Manglon, five Wa States were known to be ruled by ''[[saopha]]s''&lt;ref name="JGS"/&gt; who adopted some of the manners of the rulers of the [[Shan States]] and were assisted by ''amafs'' or ministers in the various departments:&lt;ref name="IGI"/&gt;
*'''Hrawng Nang'''
*'''Kang Hsü'''
*'''Kawng Maum'''
*'''Maw Mang'''
*'''Na Hpaw'''
*'''Ngek Hting'''
*'''Ngek Lek'''. The ''saopha'' of Ngek Lek sent a letter to Sir George Scott in 1897. He requested Scott not to pass through his territory because the sight of the British expedition would alarm the women and children.&lt;ref&gt;Dorothy Woodman, ''The Making of Burma'', Cresset, London 1962. p. 450&lt;/ref&gt; 
*'''O Mu'''
*'''Sao Hin'''. The first chairman of the [[United Wa State Party]] (UWSP) was Zhao Ni-Lai, a former military leader of the Sao Hin ''saopha'', who joined the [[Communist Party of Burma]] (CPB) in 1969.
*'''Son Mu'''. The ''saopha'' of Son Mu or Sonmu, who allowed the Hui Muslim [[Panthays]] to settle in his territory in exchange for a yearly tribute of 100 Rs, is mentioned in the records of the events that later led to the Wa-Panthay War.&lt;ref name="GEH"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/cu31924077742959/cu31924077742959_djvu.txt Census of India 1901 - Burma]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other Wa states===
*'''Maw Hpa''' and '''Mot Hai''' are states mentioned by Scott to be inhabited by the 'Tame Wa', a named used to refer to the non-[[headhunting]] Wa influenced by [[Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="JGS"/&gt;
*'''Loi Lön''' and '''Santong''', where allegedly [[lead]] was found, are two further Wa States mentioned in [[The Imperial Gazetteer of India]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/imperialgazettee22hunt/imperialgazettee22hunt_djvu.txt The Imperial gazetteer of India, p. 241]&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Western Guinean lowland forests''' are a [[tropical and subtropical moist broadleaf forests|tropical moist broadleaf forest]] [[ecoregion]] of [[West Africa]]. The ecoregion includes the lowland forests extending from the [[Atlantic Ocean]] a few hundred kilometers inland, and from western [[Côte d'Ivoire]] across [[Liberia]], southeastern [[Guinea]], most of [[Sierra Leone]], and into southwest Guinea. 

The [[Sassandra River]] of Côte d'Ivoire separates the Western Guinean forests from the [[Eastern Guinean forests]] which lie to the east.  Inland and to the west, the Western Guinean forests transition to the [[Guinean forest-savanna mosaic]], and to the [[Guinean montane forests]] at higher elevations.

The Western Guinean forests, together with the other tropical moist forests of West Africa, is included within [[Conservation International]]'s [[Guinean Forests of West Africa]] [[biodiversity hotspot]].
