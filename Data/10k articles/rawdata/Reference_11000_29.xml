'''''A Mother's Duty''''' (1658–1660) is an [[oil painting|oil]] on canvas painting by the [[Netherlands|Dutch]] painter [[Pieter de Hooch]], it is an example of [[Dutch Golden Age painting]] and is part of the collection of the [[Amsterdam Museum]], on loan to the [[Rijksmuseum]].
== Description ==
This painting by Hooch showing a woman delousing a child's hair, was documented by [[Hofstede de Groot]] in 1910, who wrote; "71. MOTHER COMBING HER CHILD'S HAIR. [[John Smith (art historian)|Sm.]] 33, 4, 67 ; de G. 5.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn01hofsuoft#page/569/mode/1up Comparative table] of catalog entries between John Smith's first [[Catalogue raisonné]] of Hooch and Hofstede de Groot's first list of Hooch paintings published in [[Oud Holland]]&lt;/ref&gt; In a homely bedroom sits a woman in profile 
to the right. She wears a red blouse and blue skirt, and is de-lousing her daughter's hair who kneels before her with her head in her lap. Behind her is an elevated, [[recessed bed]] with 
curtains; a child's [[high chair|chair]] stands in the right foreground. The door on 
the left, near which is a little dog, opens into a second room, through the 
door of which is seen a garden with slender trees.&lt;ref&gt;"Transcendence in Ordinary Domestic Life", Wall Street Journal, August 19, 2017 &lt;/ref&gt; This is one of the 
finest pictures by De Hooch in Holland. [Compare 74.] Signed on the chair " Pr d' hooch"; canvas on panel, 21 inches by 24 inches. Wrongly attributed to [[Esaias Boursse|E. Boursse]] in the 1887 catalogue of the Rijksmuseum ; the signature is absolutely genuine, and is wrongly 
described as doubtful in the 1905 catalogue. 
== Provenance ==

* [[Gerard Braamcamp]], Amsterdam, July 31, 1771, No. 88 (610 florins, Van der Dussen), (compare also [[Gerard Hoet|Hoet]], ii. 504). 
* [[Jan Lucas van der Dussen|J. L. van der Dussen]], in Amsterdam, October 31, 1774, No. 7 (750 florins). 
* J. J. de J. J. de Faesch, in Amsterdam, July 3, 1833, No. 20 (3500 florins plus 7 1/2 per cent, bought in ; or 2590 florins, Jansen for Moget). 
* Amsterdam, April 24, 1838, No. 18 (3311 florins, Brondgeest). Formerly in the [[Adriaan van der Hoop|Van der Hoop collection]], Amsterdam. 
* Now in the Rijksmuseum at Amsterdam, Van der Hoop bequest ; No. 1250 in the 1905 catalogue (formerly No. 685)."&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.org/stream/catalogueraisonn01hofsuoft#page/495/mode/1up entry 71 for Mother Combing her Child's Hair] in Hofstede de Groot, 1908&lt;/ref&gt;
== Gallery ==
This painting seems to have been a successful design for De Hooch as there are several variations on the subject of this bedroom and its doorway outside:

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3588">'''The American Empire Project''' is a book series that deals with what they theorized were [[Imperialism|imperialist]] and [[Exceptionalism|exceptionalist]] tendencies in recent [[foreign policy of the United States|US foreign policy]]. The series is published by [[Metropolitan Books]] and includes contributions by notable authors such as [[Noam Chomsky]], [[Howard Zinn]], [[Chalmers Johnson]] and [[Andrew Bacevich]].
The project's goal is to provide a critical look at what they called the imperial ambitions of the United States and to explore viable alternatives for foreign policy.

The American Empire Project was founded by [[Tom Engelhardt]] and [[Steven Fraser]] and started publication in 2004. The series comprises 32 books as at August 2017&lt;ref&gt;[http://americanempireproject.com/category/books/ List of books at americanempireproject.com] Accessed August 3, 2017&lt;/ref&gt; and is continuously expanded.

'''''Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc.''''', {{law report|24|Cal. 4th|83}} (2000), was a case decided by the [[Supreme Court of California]] that defined the [[California]] standard for [[unconscionability]]. 

Two former employees of Foundation Health Psychcare Services, Inc. (now part of [[Health Net]]), Marybeth Armendariz and Dolores Olague-Rodgers, filed complaints for [[wrongful termination]] against their former employer, contending in part that the presence of certain unconscionable provisions in their employment [[arbitration agreement]] should render the entire arbitration agreement unenforceable. Foundation Health argued that if some of the provisions were unconscionable or contrary to [[public policy]], the proper remedy would be to strike or restrict those clauses pursuant to [[California Civil Code|Civil Code]] section 1670.5, and to enforce the rest of the arbitration agreement.

In summarising developments leading to the decision of the Supreme Court of California, Judge [[Stanley Mosk]] stated:
:''The trial court chose the employees' preferred solution of refusing to enforce the arbitration agreement, but the [[California courts of appeal|Court of Appeal]] sided with the employer and enforced the agreement minus the one provision it found unconscionable. We ''[i.e. the Supreme Court]'' conclude ... that the arbitration agreement is [[unenforceable]] and that therefore the Court of Appeal's judgment must be reversed.''&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.courtlistener.com/opinion/2594580/armendariz-v-foundation-health-psychcare/ Armendariz v. Foundation Health Psychcare, 6 P.3d 669 (Cal. 2000)], 24 August 2000, accessed 3 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

The court required that there be both a procedural and substantive element of unconscionability for a [[contract]] to be voided.&lt;ref&gt;Ayres, I. &amp; Speidel, R.E., ''Studies in Contract Law, Seventh Edition'', Foundation Press, New York, NY: 2008, p. 584&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''At the Moulin Rouge, the Dance''''' is an [[oil-on-canvas]] painted by [[France|French]] artist [[Henri de Toulouse-Lautrec]]. It was painted in 1890, and is the second of a number of graphic paintings by Toulouse-Lautrec depicting the [[Moulin Rouge]] [[cabaret]] built in [[Paris]] in 1889. It portrays two dancers dancing the [[can-can]] in the middle of the crowded dance hall. A recently discovered inscription by Toulouse-Lautrec on the back of the painting reads: "The instruction of the new ones by Valentine the Boneless."&lt;ref name="PMA"&gt;{{cite book|last=Rishel|first=Joseph|title=Philadelphia Museum of Art: Handbook of the Collections|date=1995|page=206}}&lt;/ref&gt; This means that the man to the left of the woman dancing, is [[Valentin le désossé]], a well-known dancer at the Moulin Rouge, and he is teaching the newest addition to the cabaret. To the right, is a mysterious aristocratic women in pink. The background also features many aristocratic people such as poet Edward Yeats, the club owner and even Toulouse-Lautrec's father. The work is currently displayed at the [[Philadelphia Museum of Art]].

&lt;!--This was appended to the bottom of the article with no reference: "The High Court as the superior court of original jurisdiction deciding a matter under s27(6)  Trade Marks Act 1953 reached a different conclusion to the Trade Marks Commissioner though the latter acted reasonably. The appeal courts ruled that the High Court had to come to its own view on the merits, with the weight accorded the decision of the Commissioner being at discretion: "If the High Court is of a different view from the Commissioner and is, therefore, of opinion that the Commissioner’s decision is wrong, it must act on its own view.""--&gt;

[[Cantonese]] and [[Standard Chinese]], also known as Mandarin, are both [[varieties of Chinese|Chinese language varieties]] ([[Sinitic languages]]).

Mandarin is part of the [[Mandarin Chinese]] (Northern Chinese) branch, and Cantonese being part of the [[Yue Chinese]] branch.

==Vocabulary==
Standard Chinese and Cantonese are estimated to have 19% [[lexical similarity]]. Many [[cognates]] exist, but there are also [[false friends]].

Cantonese has possible [[Tai-Kadai]] substrata.

In fact, Mai states that Cantonese and Mandarin have 62% lexical similarity, instead of 23.1% and 1.8% as described by Li.&lt;ref name="mau"&gt;{{cite thesis|title=Cantonese : Language or Dialect? |last=Mau|first= Wing Yan, Annie|year=2005|institution=[[University of Hong Kong]]}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 2008 study suggested there is around 24% lexical similarity and 50% phonological similarity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite paper|title=Mutual intelligibility and similarity of Chinese dialects - Predicting judgments from objective measures|first1=Chaoju |last1=Tang |first2= Vincent J.|last2= van Heuven|institution=Chongqing Jiaotong University / University of Leiden/LUCL}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Phonology==
He states that the two varieties are similar in their phonology for only 21.5% of commonly-used words; and similar in lexical meanings and usage for only 23.1% of vocabulary entry.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Li|first= J.Z.|year=1994|title=Yu yan yan bian lun|location=Guangzhou}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mai says there are actually 63.7% phonological similarity between Cantonese and Mandarin.&lt;ref&gt;Mai. (1993). Yueyu shi Hanyu De yizhi fangyan 粵語是漢語的一支方言-與李敬忠

Cantonese has 19 initials and 53 finals. Mandarin has 19 initials.

Mandarin retains [[retroflex consonants]] from Middle Chinese, whereas Cantonese has lost them, albeit only in the early 20th century. Cantonese has [[vowel length]] as a [[distinctive feature]].

===Tones===
Cantonese has 6 [[phonemic tones]] and 3 [[checked tone]]s. Mandarin is described as having 4 phonemic tones and a [[neutral tone]]. The following chart describes the correspondence of tones compared to the [[four tones (Middle Chinese)|Four Tones]] of [[Middle Chinese]].

==Comparison to Middle Chinese==
Cantonese is thought to be one of the closest extant varieties of Chinese to [[Middle Chinese]]. On the other hand, Mandarin retains a few features such as the [[retroflex consonant]], which was lost in most southern Chinese varieties.

==Grammar==
Both are [[analytic language]]s.

Cantonese has different grammatical particles.

'''[[Brainwave entrainment]]''' is the practice of entraining one's brainwaves to a desired frequency, by means of a periodic stimulus with corresponding frequency. The stimulus can be aural as in the case of [[Binaural beats|binaural]] or [[monaural beats]] and [[isochronic tones]], visual as with a [[dreamachine]], a combination of the two as with a [[mind machine]], or even electrical or magnetic stimulation. The software intended to be used solely for brainwave entrainment comprise only a fraction of all of the software that can be used for brainwave entrainment.

[[Image:MetricImperialUSCustomaryUnits.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A baby bottle with measurements in metric, imperial and US customary]]
[[Image:GasCan.jpg|200px|thumb|right|A one-US-gallon petrol (or gasoline) can be purchased near the US–Canada border showing equivalents in imperial gallons and litres]]

Both the [[Imperial unit|imperial]] and [[United States customary units|United States customary]] [[systems of measurement]] derive from earlier [[English units|English systems]] used in the Middle Ages, that were the result of a combination of the local [[Anglo-Saxons|Anglo-Saxon]] units inherited from German tribes and [[Ancient Roman weights and measures|Roman units]] brought by [[William the Conqueror]] after the [[Norman Conquest of England]] in 1066.

Having this shared heritage, the two systems are quite similar, but there are differences. The US customary system is based on English systems of the 18th century, while the Imperial system was defined in 1824, after [[Declaration of Independence (United States)|American independence]].

==Volume==

Volume may be measured either in terms of units of cubic length or with specific volume units. The units of cubic length (the cubic inch, cubic foot, cubic mile, etc.) are the same in the imperial and US customary systems but with the specific units of volume (the [[bushel]], [[gallon]], [[fluid ounce]], etc.) they differ. The US customary system has one set of units for fluids and another set for dry goods. The imperial system has only one set defined independently of and subdivided differently from its US counterparts.

By the end of the eighteenth century various systems of volume measurement were in use throughout the British Empire. Wine was measured with [[English wine cask units|units]] based on the [[wine gallon|Queen Anne's gallon]] of 231 cubic inches (3.785&amp;nbsp;L). Beer was measured with [[English brewery cask units|units]] based on an ale gallon of 282 cubic inches (4.621&amp;nbsp;L). Grain was measured with the [[Winchester measure]] with a gallon of approximately 268.8 cubic inches (one eighth of a Winchester bushel or 4.405&amp;nbsp;L). In 1824 these were replaced with a single system based on the imperial gallon.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Wine gallons, however, continued to be used for tax purposes in the UK until the late 1990s.&lt;/ref&gt; 
Originally defined as the volume of {{convert|10|lb|kg|1|lk=in}} of distilled water (under certain conditions),&lt;ref group=note&gt;The water was to be weighed in air with brass weights with the barometer standing at {{convert|30|inHg|0|lk=in}} at a temperature of {{convert|62|°F|°C|0|lk=in}}. In 1963 these conditions were redefined such that the water was to have a density of {{val|0.998859|u=g/mL}} and to be weighed in air of density {{val|0.001217|u=g/mL}} against weights of density 8.136&amp;nbsp;g/mL.&lt;/ref&gt; then redefined by the [[Weights and Measures Act 1985]] to be exactly {{val|4.54609|u=L}} (277.4&amp;nbsp;cu&amp;nbsp;in), the imperial gallon is close in size to the old ale gallon&lt;!-- 1.6243% smaller --&gt;.

The Winchester measure was made obsolete in the British Empire but remained in use in the US.&lt;ref group=note&gt;Originally defined as the volume of a cylinder {{convert|18+1/2|in}} in diameter and {{convert|8|in}} deep, the Winchester bushel was redefined in the US as {{val|2150.42}} cubic inches.&lt;/ref&gt; The Winchester bushel was replaced with an imperial bushel of 8 imperial gallons.  The subdivisions of the bushel were maintained. As with US dry measures the imperial system divides the bushel into 4 pecks, 8 gallons, 32 quarts or 64 pints. Thus all of these imperial measures are about 3% larger than their US dry measure counterparts.

Fluid measure is not as straightforward. The American colonists adopted a system based on the 231-cubic-inch wine gallon for all fluid purposes. This became the US fluid gallon. Both the imperial and US fluid gallon are divided into 4 quarts, 8 pints or 32 [[Gill (unit)|gills]].&lt;ref group=note&gt;The gill is no longer in common use.&lt;/ref&gt; However, whereas the US gill is divided into 4 US fluid ounces, the imperial gill is divided into 5 imperial fluid ounces. So whilst the imperial gallon, quart, pint and gill are about 20% larger than their US fluid measure counterparts, the fluid ounce is about 4% smaller.&lt;ref group=note&gt;The now rarely used [[apothecaries' system]] of fluid measures further divides the fluid ounce into 8 [[dram (unit)|fluid drams]] or 480 [[minim (unit)|minims]]. Also in the imperial system there is a fluid scruple of 20 minims which is absent from the US customary system. Like the fluid ounce the dram and minim are about 4% smaller in the imperial system.&lt;/ref&gt; Note that one [[avoirdupois|avoirdupois ounce]] of water has an approximate volume of one imperial fluid ounce at 62&amp;nbsp;°F (16.67&amp;nbsp;°C).&lt;ref group=note&gt;160 imperial fluid ounces is equivalent to one imperial gallon, which is the approximate volume of 10 pounds or 160 avoirdupois ounces of water at 62&amp;nbsp;°F.&lt;/ref&gt; This convenient fluid-ounce-to-avoirdupois-ounce relation does not exist in the US system.

One noticeable comparison between the imperial system and the US system is between some Canadian and American beer bottles. Many Canadian brewers package beer in a 12-imperial-fluid-ounce bottles, which are 341&amp;nbsp;mL each. American brewers package their beer in 12-US-fluid-ounce bottles, which are 355&amp;nbsp;mL each. This results in the Canadian bottles being labelled as 11.5&amp;nbsp;fl&amp;nbsp;oz in US units when imported into the United States. Because Canadian beer bottles predate the adoption of the Metric System in that country, they are still sold and labelled in Canada as 341&amp;nbsp;mL. Canned beer in Canada is sold and labelled in 355&amp;nbsp;mL cans, and when exported to the US are labelled as 12&amp;nbsp;fl&amp;nbsp;oz.

==Length==
The international [[yard]] is defined as exactly 0.9144 [[metre]]s. This definition was agreed by the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, South Africa, Australia and New Zealand through the [[international yard and pound]] agreement of 1959.

The US survey [[foot (unit)|foot]] and survey mile have been maintained as separate units for surveying purposes to avoid the accumulation of error that would follow replacing them with the international versions, particularly with [[State Plane Coordinate System]]s. (The choice of unit for [[surveying]] purposes is based on the unit used when the [[Earth ellipsoid|overall framework]] or [[geodetic datum]] for the region was established, so that - for example - much of the former British empire still uses the Clarke foot for surveying.) The US survey foot is defined so that 1 metre is exactly 39.37&amp;nbsp;[[inch]]es, making the international foot of 0.3048&amp;nbsp;metres exactly two parts per million shorter. This is a difference of just over 3.2&amp;nbsp;mm or a little over one eighth of an inch per mile.

The main units of length (inch, foot, yard and international [[mile]]) were the same in the US, though the US rarely uses some of the intermediate units, such as the [[chain (unit)|(surveyor's) chain]] (22&amp;nbsp;yards) and the [[furlong]] (220&amp;nbsp;yards).

At one time the definition of the [[nautical mile]] was based on the sphere whose surface is the same as the Clarke Ellipsoid.  In the US, the full value of 1853.256 metres was used, but in the Commonwealth, this was rounded to 6080&amp;nbsp;feet (1853.184&amp;nbsp;m). These have been replaced by the international version, which rounds the sixtieth part of the 45° to the nearest metre, as 1852 metres.

==Weight and mass==
[[File:English mass units graph.svg|250px|thumbnail|right|Relation of English mass weights to one another]]
Traditionally, both Britain and the US used three different weight systems:  [[troy weight]] for precious metals, [[avoirdupois]] weight for most other purposes and [[apothecaries' weight]] for medicines.  However, apothecaries' weight has now been superseded by the metric system.

One important difference is the widespread use in Britain of the [[stone (weight)|stone]] of 14 pounds ({{val|6.35029318|u=kg}}) for body weight. This unit is not used in the United States, although its influence was seen in the practice, until World War II, of selling [[flour]] by a barrel of 196 pounds (14 stone). Another difference arose when Britain abolished the ''[[troy pound]]'' ({{val|373.2417216|u=g}}) on January 6, 1879, &lt;!-- should this be 1 Jan? It's in Weights and Measures Act of 1878 --&gt;leaving only the ''[[troy ounce]]'' ({{val|31.1034768|u=g}}) and its [[decimal]] subdivisions, whereas the troy pound (of 12 troy ounces) and [[pennyweight]] are still legal in the United States, although no longer widely used.

In all the systems, the fundamental unit is the [[pound (mass)|pound]] (lb), and all other units are defined as fractions or multiples of it. The tables of imperial troy mass and apothecaries' mass are the same as the corresponding United States tables, except for the British spelling "drachm" in the table of apothecaries' mass. The table of imperial avoirdupois mass is the same as the United States table up to 1 pound, but above that point the tables differ.

The imperial system has a hundredweight, defined as eight stone or 112&amp;nbsp;lb ({{val|50.80234544|u=kg}}), whereas a US hundredweight is 100&amp;nbsp;lb ({{val|45.359237|u=kg}}). In both systems, 20 hundredweights make a [[ton]]. In the US, the terms ''[[long ton]]'' ({{val|2240|u=lb}}, {{val|1016.0469088|u=kg}}) and ''[[short ton]]'' ({{val|2000|u=lb}}; {{val|907.18474|u=kg}}) are used to distinguish them. The term ''metric ton'' is also used to denote a [[tonne]] ({{val|1000|u=kg}}, {{val|2204.622|u=lb}}), which is about 2% less than the long ton.

'''Cornelis Apostool''' ({{IPA-nl|kɔrˈneːlɪs aːpɔsˈtoːl}}; 6 August 1762 – 10 February 1844) was a [[Dutch Republic|Dutch]] [[artist]], [[diplomat]], and [[museum director]].

==Biography==
Cornelis Apostool was born on 6 August 1762 in [[Amsterdam]] in the [[Dutch Republic]]. His father was Jan Apostool, a [[Mennonite Church in the Netherlands|Mennonite]] and a [[merchant]] in [[animal skin]]s and [[cocoa bean]]s, and his mother was Cornelia de Witte. He was the eleventh of twelve children, six of whom died at a young age.&lt;ref name="historici"&gt;{{nl icon}} Michiel Jonker, "[http://www.historici.nl/Onderzoek/Projecten/BWN_1780tot1830/lemmata/data/Apostool Apostool, Cornelis]", Historici.nl, 2012. Retrieved on 2013-04-25.&lt;/ref&gt;

Apostool studied [[foreign language]]s with a French teacher in [[Delft]]. He then did an [[apprenticeship]] with a [[salesman]] in silver and gold in [[Rotterdam]]. From 1784 to 1786, he was a pupil of [[landscape painter]] [[Hendrik de Meijer|Hendrik Meijer]] at the [[Rijksakademie|art academy]] back in Amsterdam. In 1786, Meijer and Apostool went to England, where Apostool stayed and lived to work as an engraver of [[aquatint]]s.&lt;ref name="historici"/&gt;

He became the Commissary-general of Commerce in [[London]] around 1793. After the [[Batavian Revolution]], he negotiated the exchange of [[prisoner of war|prisoners of war]] for the [[Batavian Republic]] in London.&lt;ref name="historici"/&gt; In 1796, he returned to his native country.&lt;ref name="bryan"&gt;{{Bryan (3rd edition)|inline=1|title=Apostool, Cornelis |volume=1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1798 to 1802, Apostool worked as an illustrator for the Agency of Interior Police and Water Management and later the Council of Interior Affaires.&lt;ref name="historici"/&gt;

In 1802, Apostool returned to his position as Commissary-general of Commerce in Londen, and he negotiated the release of Batavian ships. In 1806, he was appointed Government Secretary in the [[Dutch East Indies]]. But before he even arrived there, [[Louis Bonaparte]] became [[King of Holland]] and Apostool returned. In 1807, he briefly was a diplomat in the [[Kingdom of Naples]].&lt;ref name="historici"/&gt;

In 1808, Apostool was appointed director of the [[Rijksmuseum|Royal Museum]] in Amsterdam, which office he held until his death. He died on 10 February 1844 at the age of 81 in Amsterdam.&lt;ref name="historici"/&gt;

==Works==
Some older biographies refer to Apostool as a [[Amateur|dilettante]],&lt;ref name="bryan"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.historici.nl/retroboeken/nnbw/#source=1&amp;page=88&amp;size=800&amp;accessor=accessor_index Apostool, Cornelis], Nieuw Nederlandsch Biografisch Woordenboek, 1911. Retrieved on 2013-04-25.&lt;/ref&gt; but in a 2012 biography is claimed that he was more than a dilettante, because he made "artistically high quality [[aquatint]]s of [[painting]]s and [[drawing]]s of others".&lt;ref name="historici"/&gt;

He engraved a portrait of [[Lavinia Fenton]], afterwards Duchess of Bolton, after [[William Hogarth|Hogarth]], as well as landscapes for the ''Beauties of the Dutch School'', ''Select Views in the South of France'', ''Travels through the Maritime Alps'', and [[Thomas Daniell|Daniell]]'s ''Views of Hindostan''.&lt;ref name="bryan"/&gt;

The credit rating represents an evaluation of a [[credit rating agency]] of the qualitative and quantitative information for the prospective debtor, including information provided by the prospective debtor and other non-public information obtained by the credit rating agency's analysts.

A credit reporting (or  [[credit score]]) – in distinction to a credit rating – is a numeric evaluation of an individual's credit worthiness, which is done by a [[credit bureau]] or [[consumer credit reporting agency]].

==Sovereign credit ratings==
A [[Sovereign credit risk|sovereign credit rating]] is the credit rating of a [[Sovereignty|sovereign]] entity, such as a national government. The sovereign credit rating indicates the risk level of the investing environment of a country and is used by investors when looking to invest in particular jurisdictions, and also takes into account [[political risk]].

The "[[country risk]] rankings" table shows the ten least-risky countries for investment {{as of|2018|January|lc=y}}. Ratings are further broken down into components including political risk, economic risk. Euromoney's bi-annual country risk index monitors the political and economic stability of 185 sovereign countries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.euromoney.com/research-and-awards/surveys-and-awards/country-risk-survey|title=Country risk survey |publisher=Euromoney.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Results focus foremost on economics, specifically [[sovereign default]] risk or payment default risk for exporters (also known as a [[trade credit]] risk).

[[A. M. Best]] defines "country risk" as the risk that country-specific factors could adversely affect an insurer's ability to meet its financial obligations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www3.ambest.com/ratings/cr/crisk.aspx?l=1&amp;Menu=Country+Risk |title=Country Risk |publisher=ambest.com |accessdate=2011-08-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Short- and long-term ratings==
A rating expresses the likelihood that the rated party will go into [[Default (finance)|default]] within a given [[time horizon]]. In general, a time horizon of one year or under is considered short term, and anything above that is considered long term. In the past institutional investors preferred to consider long-term ratings. Nowadays, short-term ratings are commonly used.{{citation needed|date=June 2012}}

==Corporate credit ratings==
{{Main|Bond credit rating}}
Credit ratings can address a corporation's [[financial instrument]]s i.e. [[debt]] [[Security (finance)|security]] such as a [[Bond (finance)|bond]], but also the corporations itself. Ratings are assigned by [[credit rating agencies]], the largest of which are [[Standard &amp; Poor's]], [[Moody's]] and [[Fitch Ratings]]. They use letter designations such as A, B, C. Higher grades are intended to represent a lower [[probability of default]].

Agencies do not attach a hard number of probability of default to each grade, preferring descriptive definitions such as: "the obligor's capacity to meet its financial commitment on the obligation is extremely strong," or "less vulnerable to non-payment than other speculative issues ..." (Standard and Poors' definition of an AAA-rated and a BB-rated bond respectively).&lt;ref name="Sinclair 05"&gt;{{cite book |title=The New Masters of Capital: American Bond Rating Agencies and the Politics of Creditworthiness |last=Sinclair |first=Timothy J. |authorlink=Timothy J. Sinclair |year=2005 |publisher=Cornell University Press |location=Ithaca, New York |isbn=978-0801474910 |page=36, Bond Rating Symbols and Definitions, Table 2, |url=http://www.cornellpress.cornell.edu/book/?GCOI=80140100511490 |accessdate=21 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
However, some studies have estimated the average risk and reward of bonds by rating. One study by Moody's&lt;ref name="cantor_p24"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;cited by authors Herwig Langohr and Patricia Langohr&lt;/ref&gt; claimed that over a "5-year time horizon" bonds it gave its highest rating (Aaa) to had a "cumulative default rate" of 0.18%, the next highest (Aa2) 0.28%, the next (Baa2) 2.11%, 8.82% for the next (Ba2), and 31.24% for the lowest it studied (B2). (See "Default rate" in "Estimated spreads and default rates by rating grade" table to right.) Over a longer period, it stated "the order is by and large, but not exactly, preserved".&lt;ref name=defaults&gt;{{cite book|last=Langohr|first=Herwig|title=The Rating Agencies and Their Credit Ratings: What They Are, How They Work|year=2010|publisher=Wiley|page=48|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uChX5RuyDT4C&amp;pg=PA48 |author2=Patricia Langohr}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another study in ''Journal of Finance'' calculated the additional interest rate or "spread" corporate bonds pay over that of "riskless" US Treasury bonds, according to the bonds' rating. (See "Basis point spread" in table to right.) Looking at rated bonds for 1973–89, the authors found a AAA-rated bond paid 43 "[[basis points]]" (or 43/100 of a percentage point) over a US Treasury bond (so that it would yield 3.43% if the Treasury yielded 3.00%). A CCC-rated "junk" (or speculative) bond, on the other hand, paid over 7% (724 basis points) more than a Treasury bond on average over that period.&lt;ref name="Cantor 94-8"/&gt;&lt;ref name=altman/&gt;

Different rating agencies may use variations of an alphabetical combination of lowercase and uppercase letters, with either plus or minus signs or numbers added to further fine-tune the rating (see colored chart). The Standard &amp; Poor's rating scale uses uppercase letters and pluses and minuses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author1 = de Servigny, Arnaud |author2 =Olivier Renault | title = The Standard &amp; Poor's Guide to Measuring and Managing Credit Risk | year = 2004 |publisher = McGraw-Hill | isbn=978-0-07-141755-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The Moody's rating system uses numbers and lowercase letters as well as uppercase.

While Moody's, S&amp;P and Fitch Ratings control approximately 95% of the credit ratings business,&lt;ref name=controversy&gt;{{cite web|last=Alessi|first=Christopher|title=The Credit Rating Controversy. Campaign 2012|url=http://www.cfr.org/united-states/credit-rating-controversy/p22328|publisher=Council on Foreign Relations|accessdate=29 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; they are not the only rating agencies. DBRS's long-term ratings scale is somewhat similar to Standard &amp; Poor's and Fitch Ratings with the words high and low replacing the + and −. It goes as follows, from excellent to poor: AAA, AA (high), AA, AA (low), A (high), A, A (low), BBB (high), BBB, BBB (low), BB (high), BB, BB (low), B (high), B, B (low), CCC (high), CCC, CCC (low), CC (high), CC, CC (low), C (high), C, C (low) and D. The short-term ratings often map to long-term ratings though there is room for exceptions at the high or low side of each equivalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=DBRS: Short-Term and Long-Term Rating Relationships|url=http://dbrs.com/research/236758/short-term-and-long-term-rating-relationships.pdf|publisher=DBRS|accessdate=2013-06-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;

S&amp;P, Moody's, Fitch and DBRS are the only four ratings agencies that are recognized by the [[European Central Bank]] (ECB) for determining collateral requirements for banks to borrow from the central bank. The ECB uses a first, best rule among the four agencies that have the designated ECAI status,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=External credit assessment institution source (ECAIs)|url=http://www.ecb.europa.eu/paym/coll/elisss/ecai/html/index.en.html|publisher=European Central Bank|accessdate=21 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; which means that it takes the highest rating among the four agencies – S&amp;P, Moody's, Fitch and DBRS – to determine [[Haircut (finance)|haircuts]] and collateral requirements for borrowing. Ratings in Europe have been under close scrutiny, particularly the highest ratings given to countries like Spain, Ireland and Italy, because they affect how much banks can borrow against sovereign debt they hold.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Jones|first=Marc|title=First crunch date in Europe's ratings calendar is April 11|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/12/19/ratings-spain-italy-idUSL6N0JY3OD20131219|accessdate=21 January 2014|newspaper=Reuters|date=19 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A. M. Best rates from excellent to poor in the following manner: A++, A+, A, A−, B++, B+, B, B−, C++, C+, C, C−, D, E, F, and S. The CTRISKS rating system is as follows: CT3A, CT2A, CT1A, CT3B, CT2B, CT1B, CT3C, CT2C and CT1C. All these CTRISKS grades are mapped to one-year probability of default.

King]]’s line-art for the Eclectic Chronicle.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Chronicles Concerning Early Babylonian Kings, Vol. II: Texts and Translations | author = L. W. King | publisher = Luzac and Co. | year = 1907 | pages = 147–155 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The '''Eclectic Chronicle''', referred to in earlier literature as the ''New Babylonian Chronicle'', is an ancient [[Mesopotamia]]n account of the highlights of [[Babylonia]]n history during the post-[[Kassites|Kassite]] era prior to the 689 BC fall of the city of [[Babylon]]. It is an important source of historiography from the period of the early iron-age dark-age with few extant sources to support its telling of events.

== The text ==
Although its provenance is unknown, it is thought to originate from Babylon itself as it is written in standard Babylonian in the late [[cuneiform]] script of the region. It was acquired by the [[British Museum]] in 1898 and given the accession number 98,0711.124, subsequently the Museum reference BM 27859. Approximately two-thirds of the text has survived with the top part of the tablet broken off, losing the beginning and end of the narrative. The work is written in a single column on a small tablet in the format of an administrative or economic text, suggesting it was for private use, in marked contrast to the official histories that were typically inscribed in two or more columns on a much larger object.&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Assyrian and Babylonian Chronicles | author =  A.K. Grayson | publisher = J. J. Augustin | year = 1975 | pages = 63–65 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many respects this chronicle shares the characteristics of [[Chronicle P]], as an episodic and laconic summary of the significant events of Babylonian history, but without the errors of that other work. It seems to have been a continuation, covering the post-[[Kassites|Kassite]] period beginning prior to the reign of [[Marduk-shapik-zeri|Marduk-šāpik-zēri]] (ca. 1082–1069 BC) through to sometime after that of [[Shalmaneser V|Salmānu-ašarid V]] (727–722 BC).&lt;ref&gt;{{ cite book | title = Reallexikon der Assyriologie und Vorderasiatischen Archäologie: Klagegesang – Libanon | chapter = Königslisten und Chroniken | author = A. K. Grayson | editor = D. O. Edzard | publisher = Walter De Gruyter | year = 1984 | page = 89 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The narrative is divided into twenty two extant sections, each focusing on the events of the reign of a different Babylonian monarch (listed below) in chronological order with only a small number of omissions:

# ”He carried off a great booty”, ''he'' presumably being [[Marduk-nadin-ahhe|Marduk-nādin-aḫḫē]] or [[Assyria]]n king [[Tiglath-Pileser I|Tukultī-apil-Ešarra I]], both of whom successfully raided one another’s territory

{{for|the use of this term in an earlier or wider context|Endowment (Latter Day Saints)}}
[[File:Salt Lake Temple Celestial Room Decor.jpg|upright|thumb|The celestial room represents the highest level of heaven in LDS theology, and is reached after passing the testing portion of the endowment ceremony.]]
In [[Mormonism]], the '''endowment''' is an [[ordinance (Latter Day Saints)|ordinance]] (ceremony) designed to prepare participants to become kings, queens, priests, and priestesses in the afterlife. As part of the ceremony, participants take part in a scripted reenactment of the [[Genesis creation myth|Biblical creation]] and [[Fall of Man|fall of Adam and Eve]]. The ceremony includes a symbolic [[washing and anointing]], and receipt of a "new name" which they are not to reveal to others except at a certain part in the ceremony, and the receipt of the [[temple garment]], which Mormons then are expected to wear under their clothing day and night throughout their life. Participants are taught symbolic gestures and passwords considered necessary to pass by angels guarding the way to heaven, and are instructed not to reveal them to others.&lt;ref&gt;John D. Charles. (2004). ''Endowed from on high: Understanding the symbols of the endowment.'' Springfield, UT: Horizon Publishers.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = preparing/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Michael W. Homer. (1994). “Similarity of priesthood in masonry”: The relationship between Freemasonry and Mormonism. ''Dialogue, 27''(3), 2-113.&lt;/ref&gt; As practiced today in [[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church), the endowment also consists of a series of covenants (promises to God) that participants make, such as a covenant of [[consecration]] to the LDS Church. All Latter-day Saints who choose to serve as [[Missionary (LDS Church)|missionaries]] for the LDS Church or who choose to contract a [[celestial marriage]] in an [[Temple (LDS Church)|LDS Church temple]] must first complete the endowment ceremony.

The endowment as practiced today was instituted by founder [[Joseph Smith]] in the 1840s with further contributions by [[Brigham Young]] and his successors. The ceremony is performed in [[temple (Latter Day Saints)|Latter Day Saint temples]], which are dedicated specifically for the endowment and certain other ordinances sacred to Mormons, and are open only to Mormons who meet certain requirements. There was a brief period during the construction of the [[Salt Lake Temple]] where a small building referred to as the [[Endowment House]] was used to administer the endowment ordinance. The endowment is currently practiced by the LDS Church, several denominations of [[Mormon fundamentalism]], and a few other Mormon denominations. The LDS Church has simplified its ceremony from its 19th century form and has removed some of the more controversial elements.

A distinct endowment ceremony was also performed in the 1830s in the [[Kirtland Temple]], the first temple of the broader [[Latter Day Saint movement]], which includes other smaller churches such as the [[Community of Christ]]. The term "[[Endowment (Latter Day Saints)|endowment]]" thus has various meanings historically, and within the other branches of the Latter-Day Saint movement.

The prevalence of LDS members who undergo the endowment ceremony is difficult to determine. However, estimates show that fewer than half of converts to the LDS Church ultimately undergo the endowment ceremony, and young people preparing for missions account for about one-third of "live" endowments (as contrasted with proxy endowments for the deceased).&lt;ref&gt;Buerger, David J. (2002). ''The Mysteries of Godliness: A History of Mormon Temple Worship'', Signature Books {{ISBN|1560851767}}; data cited in "Conclusions" section&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biblical references==
Latter-day Saints cite various Old Testament references to temple ordinances such as those found in Exodus 29:4-9&lt;ref&gt;[http://lds.org/scriptures/ot/ex/29.4-9?lang=eng#4 Exodus 29:4-9]&lt;/ref&gt; and Exodus 28:2-43&lt;ref&gt;[http://lds.org/scriptures/ot/ex/28.2-43?lang=eng#27 Exodus 28:2-43]&lt;/ref&gt; and Leviticus 8:6-13.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lds.org/scriptures/ot/lev/8.6-13?lang=eng#6 Leviticus 8:6-13]&lt;/ref&gt; The words "HOLINESS TO THE LORD" can be found on LDS temples as referenced in Exodus 28:36.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lds.org/scriptures/ot/ex/28.36?lang=eng#27 Exodus 28:36]&lt;/ref&gt;

== Judeo-Christian parallels ==
The Latter-day Saint temple is referred to as a "house of learning" since it is a "kind of educational environment teaching by action and educating through ritual."&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Mormon Culture of Salvation: Force, Grace, and Glory|last=Davies|first=Douglas James|publisher=Ashgate|year=2000|isbn=|location=Burlington, VT|pages=78–79|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The endowment ordinance, as presented in Latter-day Saint temples, has been referred to as a "ritual drama"&lt;ref&gt;Nibley, Hugh. "Meanings and Functions of Temples." In ''Encyclopedia of Mormonism'', edited by Daniel H. Ludlow (New York: Macmillan, 1992) p.1460.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ro|first=Brandon|date=June 2013|title=(Re)Interpreting the Cosmic History of the Mormon Temple Experience: Theological Connections between Jewish and Catholic Sacred Space|url=http://www.comparativetheology.org/?p=351|journal=Journal of Comparative Theology|volume=4|issue=1|pages=21–73|doi=|pmid=|access-date=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that commemorates episodes of sacred history due to its “theatrical setting.”&lt;ref&gt;David John Buerger, ''The Mysteries of Godliness: A History of Mormon Temple Worship'', 2nd ed. (San Francisco: Smith Research Associates, 2002), 166.&lt;/ref&gt;  When viewed as a restoration of ancient rites, the ritual drama and aesthetic environment in which the endowment is presented are both rich in Judeo-Christian symbolism. Comparative studies of the art, architecture, and rituals found in Mormonism, such as the endowment, reveal parallels to early Catholic and Jewish traditions.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Von Wellnitz, Marcus.

==Previous Latter Day Saint endowments==
{{Main|Endowment (Latter Day Saints)}}
[[File:Mormon woman's temple clothing circa 1870s.jpeg|thumb|right|200px|Woman's endowment clothing circa the 1870s, from an illustration in [[Mark Twain]]'s ''[[Roughing It]]''.]]
The meaning and scope of the term ''endowment'' evolved during the early [[Latter Day Saint movement]], of which [[Mormonism]] is a part. The term derives from the [[Authorized King James Version]], referring to the spiritual gifts given the disciples of [[Jesus]] on the day of [[Pentecost]], in which they were "endowed with power from on high,"&lt;!--
FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Gospel of Luke]]'' 24:49 ([[Authorized King James Version]]) ("And, behold, I send the promise of my Father upon you; but tarry ye in the city of Jerusalem until ye be endowed with power from on high.").&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; Christians generally understand this endowment to refer to the gift of the [[Holy Spirit]], which the Latter Day Saints believe is given at the [[Confirmation (Latter Day Saints)|Confirmation]] ceremony. In 1831, however, Smith began teaching that the elders of the church needed to be further "endowed with power from on high" in order to be effective proselytizers.&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Phelps|1833|p=84}}. [[s:The Doctrine and Covenants/Section 38|D&amp;C 38:32]]. {{Harvnb|Phelps|1833|pp=97–98}}. [[s:The Doctrine and Covenants/Section 43|D&amp;C 43:16]].&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--

--&gt; He therefore gathered the elders together at a [[General conference (Latter Day Saints)|General Conference]] in June 1831 and "endowed" them with this power by ordaining them to the [[Melchizedek Priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|High Priesthood]].&lt;!--

FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Phelps|1833|pp=97–98}}. [[s:The Doctrine and Covenants/Section 44|D&amp;C 44:1-2]] (God would call the elders of the church together in Kirtland in a General Conference and "pour out [his] Spirit upon them in that day they assemble themselves together"). Kirtland Revelation Book, p. 91 (revelation given to an individual assuring him that "at the conference meeting he [would] be ordained unto power from on high"). Cannon and Cook, 6-7 (elders at the conference were ordained for the first time to the High Priesthood); The official church history states that during this conference, "the authority of the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] was manifested and conferred for the first time upon several of the Elders" {{harv|Roberts|1902|pp=175–76}}. The editor of this history believed this was a mistake, because it would not be consistent with the then-common Mormon belief that the priesthood had been conferred prior to the church's founding in 1830. (Id. at 176.) Several modern historians believe the official record was not mistaken and is consistent with other historical records, and that this 1831 endowment marked the [[Restorationism (Christian primitivism)|restoration]] of the Melchizedek priesthood (Quinn). Corrill, 18 (ordination "consisted [of] the endowment--it being a new order--and bestowed authority"). {{Harvnb|Booth|1831}} (many of the Saints "have been ordained to the High Priesthood, or the order of Melchizedek; and profess to be endowed with the same power as the ancient apostles were").&lt;/ref&gt;

By the mid-1830s, Smith was teaching that a further endowment was necessary, this time requiring the completion of the Kirtland Temple as a house of God where God could pour out his [[Holy Spirit]].&lt;ref&gt;[[s:The Doctrine and Covenants/Section 88|D&amp;C 88:119]]. [[s:The Doctrine and Covenants/Section 94|D&amp;C 94:3]] (identifying the location of the temple in Kirtland). [[s:The Doctrine and Covenants/Section 95|D&amp;C 95:8]] (in this building the Lord "design[ed] to endow those [he] had chosen with power on high"). Kirtland Revelation Book, p. 98 (referring to the Kirtland endowment as a "greater endowment").&lt;/ref&gt; Upon the completion of the Kirtland Temple after three years of construction (1833–1836), the elders of the church gathered for this second promised endowment in early 1836. The Kirtland endowment included a ritual ceremony involving preparatory washings and anointings with oil, followed by a gathering in the temple in which many reported [[spiritual gifts]] such as [[glossolalia|speaking in tongues]] and visions.&lt;ref&gt;See: Arrington, "Oliver Cowdery's Kirtland, Ohio, 'Sketch Book,'" ''BYU Studies,'' Summer 12 [1972]: 416-420; Cook and Backman, ''[http://www.boap.org/LDS/Early-Saints/Kirt-Elders.html Kirtland Elders' Quorum Record, 1836-1841]'' pp. 1-9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Nauvoo endowment===

====Overview====
The Nauvoo endowment consists of two phases: (1) an initiation, and (2) an instructional and testing phase. The initiation consists of a [[washing and anointing]], culminating in the clothing of the patron in a "[[Temple garment|Garment of the Holy Priesthood]]", which is thereafter worn as an undergarment.

The instructional and testing phase of the endowment consists of a scripted reenactment of [[Adam and Eve (LDS Church)|Adam and Eve's]] experience in the [[Garden of Eden]] (performed by live actors—called officiators; in the mid-20th century certain portions were adapted to a film presentation).&lt;ref&gt;[//www.lds.org/ensign/2008/03-ee/president-gordon-b-hinckley "President Gordon B. Hinckley,"] ''[[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]]'' (supp.), March 2008, pp. 2–13.&lt;/ref&gt; The instruction is punctuated with oaths, symbolic gestures, and a prayer around an altar, and at the end of instruction, the initiate's knowledge of symbolic gestures and key-words is tested at a "veil."&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Buerger|1987|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Introduction====
On May 3, 1842, [[Joseph Smith]] prepared the second floor of his [[Red Brick Store]], in [[Nauvoo, Illinois|Nauvoo]], [[Illinois]], to represent "the interior of a temple as circumstances would permit".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson and Bergera, 2&lt;/ref&gt; The next day, May 4, he introduced the Nauvoo endowment ceremony to nine associates: [[Assistant President of the Church|Associate President]] and [[Patriarch (Mormonism)|Patriarch to the Church]] [[Hyrum Smith|Hyrum]] (Joseph Smith's brother); first counselor in the [[First Presidency]], [[William Law]]; three of the [[Apostle (Mormonism)|Twelve Apostles]], [[Brigham Young]], [[Heber C. Kimball]] and [[Willard Richards]]; Nauvoo stake president, [[William Marks (Mormonism)|William Marks]]; two [[Bishop (Mormonism)|bishops]], [[Newel K. Whitney]] and [[George Miller (Latter Day Saints)|George Miller]]; and a close friend, Judge [[James Adams (lawyer)|James Adams]] of [[Springfield, Illinois|Springfield]], [[Illinois]].

Concerning the day's activities, Smith recorded:
{{quote|the communications I made to this council were of things spiritual, and to be received only by the spiritual minded: and there was nothing made known to these men but what will be made known to all the Saints of the last days, so soon as they are prepared to receive, and a proper place is prepared to communicate them, even to the weakest of Saints: therefore let the Saints be diligent in building the Temple.}}

Throughout 1843 and 1844 Smith continued to initiate other men, as well as women, into the endowment ceremony. By the time of his death on June 27, 1844, more than 50 persons had been admitted into the [[Anointed Quorum]], the name by which this group called themselves.

====The Nauvoo endowment and Freemasonry====

{{Main|Mormonism and Freemasonry}}
There are many [[Mormonism and Freemasonry|similarities]] between Smith's endowment ceremony and certain rituals of [[Freemasonry]], particularly the [[Royal Arch Masonry|Royal Arch]] degree. These specific similarities included instruction in various signs, tokens, and passwords, and the imposition of various forms of the [[Blood oath (Latter Day Saints)|penalties]] for revealing them. The original wording of the penalties, for example, closely followed the wording of the Masonic penalties.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Buerger|1987|p=55}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the predominant view by historians, Smith used and adapted material from the Masonic rituals in creating the endowment ceremony. All of those first initiated by Smith on May 4, 1842, were longstanding or recent Masons: Adams was the Deputy Grand Master of the Masonic Grand Lodge of Illinois; Whitney, Miller and Kimball had previously been Lodge Masters; Smith's brother, Hyrum, had been a Mason since 1827; and the remaining five participants (Law, Marks, Young, Richards, and Smith himself) had been initiated as [[Freemason]]s just weeks before the meeting. However, none of these Masons ever charged Smith with breaking any of Masonry's oaths or revealing its secrets. As a matter of fact, one Mormon historian has noted that these Masonic parallels confirmed to these men "the breath of the restoration impulse and was evidence of Smith's divine calling".&lt;ref&gt;Ehat, 25&lt;/ref&gt;

The LDS Church has never commented officially on these similarities, although certain features of the two rituals have been called "analogous" by one official Church Historian.&lt;ref&gt;See, e.g., {{Harvnb|Burrows|Foraker|1904|p=741}} (in which LDS Church [[general authority]] and historian [[B. H. Roberts]] stated that the Masonic ritual was "analogous, perhaps, in some of its features" to the obligations and covenants of the Endowment)&lt;/ref&gt; The LDS Church [[apostle (Latter Day Saints)|apostle]] [[John A. Widtsoe]] downplayed the similarities, arguing that they "do not deal with the basic matters [the endowment] but rather with the mechanism of the ritual."&lt;ref&gt;Widstoe (1960), 112&lt;/ref&gt; One LDS Church educator, however, was censured in the 1970s by the [[Church Educational System]] for arguing that the endowment ceremony had a dependent relationship with the rituals of freemasonry.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Homer|1994|p=1}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

Some within the LDS Church, particularly Smith's contemporaries, have expressed the view that the endowment was given anciently by God in its original form at the [[Temple of Solomon]], but that the form of the ritual degenerated into the form used by Freemasons. [[Heber C. Kimball]] clearly supported this position: "We have the true Masonry. The Masonry of today is received from the apostasy which took place in the days of Solomon and David. They have now and then a thing that is correct, but we have the real thing"&lt;ref&gt;Manuscript History of Brigham Young, November 13, 1858, p. 1085, LDS Church archives.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Later modifications by the LDS Church===
After Smith officiated in Brigham Young's endowment in 1842 Smith told him, "Brother Brigham, this is not arranged perfectly; however we have done the best we could under the circumstances in which we are placed. I wish you to take this matter in hand: organize and systematize all these ceremonies".&lt;ref&gt;Anderson and Bergera, 7&lt;/ref&gt; Young did as Smith directed, and under Young's direction the Nauvoo endowment ceremony was introduced to the church at large in the [[Nauvoo Temple]] during the winter of 1845&amp;ndash;46. A spacious hall in the temple's attic was arranged into appropriate ordinance "rooms" using canvas partitions. Potted plants were used in areas representing the Garden of Eden, and other areas were furnished appropriately, including a room representing the celestial kingdom.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (1979), 366-374&lt;/ref&gt; Over 5,500 persons received their endowments in this temple.&lt;ref&gt;Brown (2006), 361&lt;/ref&gt;

Young introduced the same ceremony in the [[Utah Territory]] in the 1850s, first in the [[Endowment House]] and then in the [[St. George Utah Temple|St. George Temple]]. During this period the ceremony had never been written down, but was passed orally from temple worker to worker. Shortly after the dedication of the St. George Temple, and before his death in 1877, Young became concerned about the possibility of variations in the ceremony within the church's temples and so directed the majority of the text of the endowment to be written down. This document became the standard for the ceremony thereafter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Buerger|2002|p=110}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also in 1877, the first endowments for the dead were performed in the St. George Temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Buerger|2002|p=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1893, minor alterations in the text were made in an attempt to bring uniformity to the ceremony as administered in the temples.&lt;ref&gt;Buerger, 128&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1904 and 1906, the temple ceremony received very public scrutiny during the [[Smoot Hearings|1904 Senate investigation]] of LDS Apostle and U.S. Senator, [[Reed Smoot (U.S. Senator)|Reed Smoot]]. Of particular concern to senators was the ceremony's "[[law of vengeance]]", in which, during the hearings, it was revealed that participants took an [[oath of vengeance]] to pray that God would "avenge the blood of the prophets on this nation".&lt;ref name="Buerger 2002 134"&gt;{{Harvnb|Buerger|2002|p=134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Bancroft 1859 358"&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bancroft|1859|p=358}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The "prophets" were Joseph and Hyrum Smith, and "this nation" was the United States.&lt;ref name="Buerger 2002 134"/&gt;

Beginning in 1919, church president [[Heber J. Grant]] [[Good Neighbor policy (LDS Church)|appointed a committee]] charged with revising the ceremony, which was done under the direction of Apostle [[George F. Richards]] from 1921 to 1927. Richards received permission to write down the previously unwritten portions of the ceremony. Among his revisions was the elimination of the "[[law of vengeance]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Buerger|2002|pp=139&amp;ndash;40}}&lt;/ref&gt; Previous versions of the ceremony into the 1880s also had the representative of the Lord cut the symbols in the garments with a knife through the veil,&lt;ref name="Bancroft 1859 358"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Bennett|1842|p=248}}.&lt;/ref&gt; with one source suggesting an early version cut into the knee of the participant to create a scar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvtxt|Green|1859|p=49}}.&lt;/ref&gt; The committee also removed the violent language from the [[Blood oath (Latter Day Saints)|"penalty" portions]] of the ceremony. Prior to 1927, participants made an oath that if they ever revealed the secret gestures of the ceremony, they would be subject to the following:
{{quote|&lt;poem&gt;my throat ... be cut from ear to ear, and my tongue torn out by its roots
our breasts ... be torn open, our hearts and vitals torn out and given to the birds of the air and the beasts of the field
your body ... be cut asunder and all your bowels gush out.
[changed to] different ways in which life may be taken.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Buerger|2002|p=141}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;}} Each [[temple president]] received a "President's Book" with the revised ceremony ensuring uniformity throughout the church's temples.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Buerger|2002|pp=136&amp;ndash;142}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first filmed versions of the endowment were introduced in the 1950s, by a committee headed by [[Gordon B. Hinckley]]. That change was initiated by church president [[David O. McKay]] as a way of providing the instruction simultaneously in different languages, an innovation made necessary by the construction of the [[Bern Switzerland Temple]], the church's first temple in Europe. {{As of|2005}}, ceremonies in all but two ([[Salt Lake Temple]] and [[Manti Utah Temple|Manti Temple]]) of the church's 128 operating temples are presented using the filmed version.&lt;ref&gt;Buerger, 166-169&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1990, further changes included the elimination of all [[Blood oath (Latter Day Saints)|blood oaths]] and penalties. These penalties, representing what the member would rather suffer than reveal the sacred signs given them in the ceremony, were symbolized by gestures for having the throat cut, the breast cut open, and the bowels torn out. Changes also included the elimination of the five points of fellowship, the role of the preacher, and all reference to [[Lucifer]]'s "popes and priests" were dropped. The ceremony was also changed to lessen the differences in treatment between men and women. Women no longer are required to covenant to obey their husbands, but instead must covenant only to follow their husbands as their husbands follow God. Also, Eve is no longer explicitly blamed for the Fall, and several references to Adam were replaced with references to Adam and Eve. The lecture at the veil was also cut, and some repetition was eliminated.&lt;ref&gt;"Next came the part of the ceremony devoted to the higher Melchizedek Priesthood with its special garments (white robe; white, turban-like cap with a bow over the right ear; apron; and white moccasins) and more complicated signs and tokens like the Sign of the Nail; the Patriarchal Grip, or the ''Sure'' Sign of the Nail; and the sign of the Second Token." ''The Mormon Murders'', Steven Naifeh, Gregory White Smith, St. Martins's Press, New York, 1988, {{ISBN|0-312-93410-6}}, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;In 1990, several significant portions of the endowment ceremony performed worldwide in Mormon temples were eliminated: the wording: "''even at the peril of your life''" and "''The representation of the penalties indicates ways in which life may be taken,''" was deleted. Women no longer have to swear an oath and covenant of obedience to their husbands; a segment showing a Christian minister working hand-in-hand with Lucifer to deceive mankind for profit by teaching orthodox Christian doctrine was removed; three morbid gestures that imply Mormon patrons will lose their lives through having their throats slashed, their hearts torn out, and their abdomens cut open if they reveal temple secrets; and the Five Points of Fellowship in which initiates embrace The Lord (a male temple worker) through openings in the Veil of the temple."

A 1996 estimate by Richard Cowan states that around 150 million endowments have been performed, most of which were [[Baptism for the dead|in behalf of deceased persons]].{{Citation needed|date=January 2012}}

==Modern endowment as practiced by the LDS Church==
The most well-known Mormon endowment ceremony is that performed by the LDS Church in its [[Temple (LDS Church)|temples]]. This ceremony is open only to members of the church deemed worthy and given a "[[temple recommend]]" by their ecclesiastical leaders after one or more personal interviews. It comprises four parts:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Preparing to Enter the Holy Temple |date=August 2002 |publisher=LDS Church |page=7 |url=https://www.lds.org/manual/preparing-to-enter-the-holy-temple/preparing-to-enter-the-holy-temple?lang=eng |quote=The endowment and the temple work as revealed by the Lord to the Prophet Joseph Smith ... fall clearly into four distinct parts: The preparatory ordinances; the giving of instruction by lectures and representations; covenants; and, finally, tests of knowledge.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Widstoe |first1=John A. |title=Temple Worship |journal=The Utah Genealogical and Historical Magazine |date=April 1921 |volume=12 |issue=2 |page=58 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=u78UAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=RA2-PA58#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;
# An [[Washing and anointing|initiatory]] composed of the preparatory ordinances of washing and anointing
# An instructional portion with lectures and representations

# A testing of knowledge

===The initiatory===
{{More footnotes|section|date=September 2011}}
The "initiatory" is a prelude to the endowment proper, similar to [[Chrismation]], and consists of (1) instruction, (2) multiple symbolic [[washing and anointing]] ordinances, (3) being clothed in the [[temple garment]], and (4) receiving a "new name" in preparation for the endowment.&lt;ref name="Buerger 1994"&gt;{{Harvnb|Buerger|1994}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Washing and anointing]] are perhaps the earliest practiced [[temple (Latter Day Saints)|temple]] ordinances for the living since the organization of the LDS Church. There is evidence that these ordinances have been performed since 1832. They were first practiced in the Whitney Store as part of the [[School of the Prophets]] and were part of the Kirtland endowment.

As part of the endowment ceremony, the ordinance of [[washing and anointing]] symbolizes the ritual cleansing of priests that took place at Israel's [[Tabernacle]], [[Solomon's Temple]], and the [[Second Temple]], later known as [[Herod's Temple]]. The washing symbolizes being "cleansed from the blood of this generation," and being anointed to become "clean from the blood and sins of this generation."&lt;ref name="Buerger 1994"/&gt;

[[File:Garment.jpg|upright|right|thumb|200px|The [[temple garment]] underwear Mormons wear daily after receiving them during their initiatory ceremony&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|title='Mormon Underwear' is the Temple Garment and is Sacred to Latter-day Saints|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SkTz_NQqKA8#t=2m50s|website=Youtube.com|agency=LDS Church|publisher=Mormon Newsroom|date=22 October 2014|time=2:50}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.mormonnewsroom.org/article/temple-garments|website=Mormon Newsroom|title=Temple Garments}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
After the [[washing and anointing]], the patron is given the [[temple garment]], formally called the "Garment of the Holy Priesthood". This garment represents the "coats of skins" given to [[Adam and Eve]] in the [[Garden of Eden]].&lt;ref name="Buerger 1994"/&gt;

Similar ordinances are performed for the living and the dead in LDS temples, where men are:
* Ordained to the priesthood (for the dead only, since a man coming to the temple for his own endowment would have previously received his [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] ordination)
* Washed with water (which only involves a cursory sprinkling of water)
* Blessed to have the washing sealed
* Anointed with oil
* Blessed to have the anointing sealed
* Clothed in holy garments
Women receive the same ordinances, except for the ordination.&lt;ref name="Buerger 1994"/&gt;

As the final part of the initiatory, the patron is given a new name, which is a key word used during the ceremony. In general, this name is only known to the person to whom it is given; however, an endowed LDS woman reveals her name to her endowed husband (but not vice versa). The "new name" is supported in part by [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/rev/2/17#17 Book of Revelation 2:17] and [http://scriptures.lds.org/en/rev/3/12#12 3:12], referring to a "white stone" with "a new name written" thereon.&lt;ref name="Buerger 1994"/&gt; According to some sources, the same male and female names are given to each man and woman participating in the ceremony on a given day, depending on whether they are receiving the endowment for themselves or on behalf of a deceased person. If a new name coincides with their own name, "Adam" or "Eve" is given instead.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.fullerconsideration.com/templenameoracle.php&lt;/ref&gt;

===The instructional portion===
Most Latter-day Saints who attend the [[temple (LDS Church)|temple]] believe that the endowment focuses heavily on the [[Plan of salvation (Latter Day Saints)|plan of salvation]] and the [[Atonement in Christianity|Atonement]] of Jesus Christ. Parts of the plan of salvation explained include:

*the eternal Nature of God, of Jesus Christ, and their divinity;
*the [[Pre-existence|pre-mortal existence]] and eternal nature of man (mankind lived with God before mortal life);
*the reality of [[Satan]], who is Jesus' and Adam's rebellious spirit brother;
*the [[fall of Adam]] and the reasons for mortality, trials, and blessings;
*the Atonement of Jesus Christ, and the need for the Atonement;
*the relationship of grace, faith, and works;
*death, the literal resurrection, and qualifying for various [[degrees of glory|kingdoms of glory]];
*the need for personal righteousness, [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenant]] keeping, and love of God and fellow man;
*that our Heavenly Father loves us as his children and wants us to become like he is, to receive a fulness of joy;
*the sanctity and eternal nature of the family.

The following description is given in an LDS Church publication of what to expect when one enters the temple:

{{quote|[During the endowment] you will receive instructions and learn the important events of our eternal journey. You'll learn about the creation of this world and about our first parents being placed in the Garden of Eden. You'll learn how Satan tempted Adam and Eve and how they were cast out of the garden and out of the presence of God into our world, with its opposition in all things. Here they learned about the joys as well as the discomforts of life.

After Adam and Eve were cast out of the Garden of Eden and placed in the world where we now live, they were taught the gospel, and they entered into covenants of obedience with God, just as you will in the temple. How we keep these covenants determines the nature of the life we will enjoy after this mortal experience.

In the eternal world there are kingdoms of glory. You will inherit one of these, depending on your performance in this life. The aim of the gospel and the purpose of temple marriage are not only to keep us together, but also to make us eligible for Heavenly Father's highest reward for us — exaltation in the celestial kingdom. This kingdom is symbolized by the celestial room.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lds.org/new-era/1975/06/in-the-house-of-the-lord "In The House of the Lord"], ''[[New Era (magazine)|New Era]]'', '''4'''(5), June 1975, p. 20.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The endowment is often thought of as a series of lectures where Latter-day Saints are taught about the creation of the world, the events in the Garden of Eden, what happened after Adam and Eve were cast out of the Garden into the "telestial world", and the progression of righteous individuals through "terrestrial" laws to the [[celestial kingdom]] and exaltation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Steinfels |first1=Peter |title=Mormons Drop Rites Opposed by Women |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1990/05/03/us/mormons-drop-rites-opposed-by-women.html |work=The New York Times |date=3 May 1990 |quote=Participants follow a dramatic reenactment, once performed by actors but now presented in most temples by films, of the Creation, life on earth and a return to God.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ceremony, Latter-day Saints are dressed in temple clothes or [[temple robes#Latter Day Saint tradition|temple robes]], are taught about various gospel laws (including obedience, chastity, sacrifice and consecration) and make covenants to obey these laws. The early Mormon leader Brigham Young taught that participants are given "signs and tokens" that "enable you to walk back to the presence of the Father, passing the angels who stand as sentinels" and gain eternal exaltation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Preparing to Enter the Holy Temple |date=August 2002 |publisher=LDS Church |page=31–32 |url=https://www.lds.org/manual/preparing-to-enter-the-holy-temple/preparing-to-enter-the-holy-temple?lang=eng| quote='Your endowment is, to receive all those ordinances in the House of the Lord, which are necessary for you, after you have departed this life, to enable you to walk back to the presence of the Father, passing the angels who stand as sentinels, being able to give them the key words, the signs and tokens, pertaining to the holy Priesthood, and gain your eternal exaltation in spite of earth and hell.' ... The blessing of the endowment is required for full exaltation. ... 'For behold ... no one can reject this covenant and be permitted to enter into my glory.'}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hammarberg |first1=Melvyn |title=The Mormon Quest for Glory: The Religious World of the Latter-day Saints |date=1 July 2013 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=0199737622 |page=172 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=T0o9kvCRQ4gC&amp;pg=PT172#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt; At the end of the ceremony, the participant is "tested" on their knowledge of what he or she was taught and covenanted to do and then admitted into the celestial room, where he or she may meditate and pray.

===Covenant portion===
{{main|Covenant (Latter Day Saints)}}
The LDS Church defines a [[Covenant (Latter Day Saints)|covenant]] as:
{{quote|Sometimes denot[ing] an agreement between persons (1 Sam. 23:18) or nations (1 Sam. 11:1); more often between God and man; but in this latter case it is important to notice that the two parties to the agreement do not stand in the relation of independent and equal contractors. God in his good pleasure fixes the terms, which man accepts. The same word is sometimes rendered "testament."

The gospel is so arranged that principles and ordinances are received by covenant placing the recipient under strong obligation and responsibility to honor the commitment. Thus the severe consequences to Ananias and Sapphira, who deliberately broke their covenant and lied unto God (Acts 5:1–11).&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | url= //www.lds.org/scriptures/bd/covenant?lang=eng&amp;letter=c | title= Bible Dictionary (LDS Church) |work= [[LDS edition of the Bible|KJV (LDS)]] | publisher= LDS Church }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The temple ceremony involves entering into solemn covenants. Critics{{Who|date=September 2011}} have expressed concern that a person may be denied access to the specific details of these covenants until that person is faced with making them in the temple, making it impossible to reflect on their meaning or ramifications. The LDS Church does offer a temple preparation seminar and freely publishes both the student booklet, ''[[Preparing to Enter the Holy Temple]]'',&lt;ref name = preparing&gt;[//www.lds.org/manual/preparing-to-enter-the-holy-temple ''Preparing to Enter the Holy Temple'',] (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church).&lt;/ref&gt; and the teacher's manual, ''Endowed from on High: Temple Preparation Seminar'',&lt;ref&gt;[//www.lds.org/manual/endowed-from-on-high-temple-preparation-seminar-teachers-manual ''Endowed from on High: Temple Preparation Seminar Teacher’s Manual''] (Salt Lake City, Utah: LDS Church)&lt;/ref&gt; on its website. These books and the seminar which may be held are designed to help prepare members for the temple; attendance at the seminar is often required before a bishop will issue a temple recommend for the first time to a member. In the seminar, it is taught that all of the covenants entered into during the endowment have a basis in [[Standard works|Latter-day Saint scripture]]; however, the specifics of the covenants are not revealed.

===Testing portion===

At the end of the endowment ceremony the participant is tested at a physical veil by a man representing the Lord on the signs and tokens just learned.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Buerger|1987|pp=44–45}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Brooks |first1=Joanna |title=Mormon Feminism: Essential Writings |date=2 November 2015 |publisher=Oxford University Press |location=Oxford, UK |isbn=0190248033 |page=286 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=c2FjCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA286#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false |quote=For men, 'the Lord' is Elohim who gives and later tests the man's names, signs, and tokens.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Before 1990 at the veil the participant also put their arm around and pressed their cheek, shoulders, knees and feet against the person through the veil in what was called "the five points of fellowship."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last1=Dart |first1=John |title=Mormons Modify Temple Rites : Ceremony: Woman's vow to obey husband is dropped. Changes are called most significant since 1978 |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1990-05-05/news/vw-353_1_temple-ceremony |work=Los Angeles Times |date=5 May 1990 |quote=Also dropped is an 'embrace' of a man representing God, who stands behind a ceiling-to-floor veil. Reaching through a slit in the veil, the church member puts his or her hand to the back of the deity and presses against him at the cheek, shoulders, knees and feet with the veil between them. The contact at 'five points of fellowship,' including the hand to his back, has been omitted, although the member must still give a secret handshake and repeat a lengthy password.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Requirements for participation===
:''See also [[Temple (LDS Church)#Entrance requirements|Temple (LDS Church) Entrance Requirements]]''
The endowment is open only to Mormons who have a valid "temple recommend." To be eligible to receive a temple recommend, one must be deemed worthy by church leadership and have been a member of the LDS Church for at least one year. A male member of the church must hold the [[Melchizedek priesthood (Latter Day Saints)|Melchizedek priesthood]] to participate in the endowment. A temple recommend is signed by the person receiving the recommend, a member of the person's [[Bishop (Latter Day Saints)|bishopric]] and a member of the [[stake (Latter Day Saints)|stake]] presidency, who each perform a personal, one-on-one "worthiness interview." Persons seeking a recommend to attend the temple for the first time and receive their endowment will generally meet with their [[bishop (LDS Church)|bishop]] and [[stake president]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Preparing to Enter the Holy Temple |date=August 2002 |publisher=LDS Church |page=3 |url=https://www.lds.org/manual/preparing-to-enter-the-holy-temple/preparing-to-enter-the-holy-temple?lang=eng |quote=You must possess a current recommend to be admitted to the temple. This recommend must be signed by the bishop of your ward and the president of your stake. ... Only those who are worthy should go to the temple. The bishop has the responsibility of making inquiries into our personal worthiness.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

These interviews cover what the church believes to be the most important factors of personal morality and worthiness, including whether the person has a basic belief in key church doctrines such as the divinity of [[Jesus]] and the [[Restoration (Mormonism)|restoration]]; whether the person attends church meetings and supports the leadership of the LDS Church; whether the person affiliates with [[Mormon fundamentalists]] or other people considered by the church to be [[apostasy|apostate]]; whether the person is honest and lives the [[law of chastity]] and the [[Word of Wisdom]]; whether the person abuses family members; whether the person pays [[tithe|tithing]] and any applicable [[spousal support|spousal]] or [[child support]]; and whether the person has [[Confession (religion)|confessed]] to serious past sins.

Prior to participating in the endowment, members of the LDS Church frequently participate in a six-part temple preparation class which discusses temple-related topics but does not directly discuss the details of the ceremony.

===Secrecy===
[[File:LDS Prayer Circle Endowment Ceremony.png|thumb|Participants in temple clothing in a prayer circle during the LDS endowment ceremony]]
Official church publications state that temple ceremonies are confidential and not to be discussed outside the temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Preparing to Enter the Holy Temple |date=August 2002 |publisher=LDS Church |page=2 |url=https://www.lds.org/manual/preparing-to-enter-the-holy-temple/preparing-to-enter-the-holy-temple?lang=eng |quote=We do not discuss the temple ordinances outside the temples. ... They are kept confidential lest they be given to those who are unprepared. ... And, the Lord has every right and authority to direct that matters relating to the temple be kept sacred and confidential.}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[B. H. Roberts]] declared that certain aspects of the endowment ceremony were intended to be "secret from the world".&lt;ref&gt;Testimony of [[B.H. Roberts]] before a U.S. Senate Committee, as reported in {{Harvnb|Burrows|Foraker|1904|p=741}}.&lt;/ref&gt; In this regard, Facsimile No. 2 in the [[Book of Abraham]] (part of the [[LDS Church]] [[standard works]]) clarifies that there are things that "cannot be revealed unto the world; but is to be had in the Holy Temple of God."&lt;ref&gt;[http://lds.org/scriptures/pgp/abr/fac-2?lang=eng Facsimile no. 2, item 8], [[Book of Abraham]]&lt;/ref&gt; This information includes, in the initiation and instructional/testing phases of the endowment ceremony, certain ''names'' and symbolic gestures called ''tokens'' and ''signs.'' Prior to revisions in 1990, the LDS Church's version of the endowment also included a gesture called a "[[penalty (Mormonism)|penalty]]." The ceremony stated that the "representation of the execution of the penalties indicates different ways in which life may be taken".&lt;ref name="Buerger 1994"/&gt; However, the LDS Church has removed the "penalty" portions of the ceremony, protecting the "names", "tokens," and "signs" by a simple "covenant and promise." Still, such information has been published in various sources, unauthorized by the LDS Church.

Other than the ceremony's signs and tokens (and formerly penalties), which remain a central part of the ceremonies, the remainder of the ceremony carries with it no covenants of secrecy.&lt;!--FOOTNOTE--&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Buerger|1987|p=34}}.&lt;/ref&gt; However, most Latter-day Saints are generally unwilling to discuss the specific details of the ceremony. Latter-day Saints commonly state that the rituals are "sacred" but not "secret," and Latter-day Saint [[Apostle (Mormonism)|apostle]] [[Boyd K. Packer]] has encouraged members not to "discuss the temple ordinances outside the temples".&lt;ref&gt;Packer (2002), 2&lt;/ref&gt;

In practice, Latter-day Saints keep silent about the ceremony for numerous reasons. Most Latter-day Saints hold the making of these covenants to be highly sacred. Most church members also believe that details of the ceremony should be kept from those who are not properly prepared.&lt;ref&gt;[[ElRay L. Christiansen]], [http://www.lds.org/new-era/1971/06/some-things-you-need-to-know-about-the-temple "Some Things You Need to Know about the Temple"] ''[[New Era (magazine)|New Era]]'', June 1971: "The ordinances of the temple are so sacred that they are not open to the view of the public. They are available only to those who qualify through righteous living. They are performed in places dedicated especially for this purpose. Their sacred nature is such that discussion in detail outside the temple is inappropriate."&lt;/ref&gt; Many Latter-day Saints believe that [[Jesus]] often taught in parables for the same reason.&lt;ref&gt;{{sourcetext|source=Bible|version=King James|book=Matthew|chapter=13|verse=10|range=-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other Latter-day Saints remain silent about the ceremony because they believe that its meaning cannot be properly conveyed without the experience in the [[temple (LDS Church)|temple]]. [[Brigham Young]] stated:

{{quote|There are but few, very few of the Elders of Israel, [and members of the church] now on earth, who know the meaning of the word endowment. To know, they must experience....&lt;ref&gt;Widtsoe, 1954, pp. 415-416&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition, church members are colloquially taught that the only place where the temple ceremonies should be discussed, even amongst faithful members, is within the temple.{{cn|date=October 2018}}

Some [[Mormons]] have suggested that the Latter-day Saint reluctance to discuss the endowment encourages attacks and unauthorized exposés by [[Evangelicalism|evangelical]] [[Christianity|Christians]] and others, and therefore advocate a more transparent attitude toward the ceremony.&lt;ref&gt;''See, e.g.'', Homer, 42&lt;/ref&gt;

'''example.com''', '''example.net''', '''example.org''', and '''example.edu''' are [[Second-level domain|second-level]] [[domain name]]s reserved for documentation purposes and examples of the use of domain names.

The second-level domain label ''example'' for the [[top-level domain]]s [[.com]], [[.net]], and [[.org]], was reserved in 1999 by the [[Internet Engineering Task Force]] in RFC 2606, Section 3,&lt;ref&gt;RFC 2606, ''Reserved Top Level DNS Names'', D. Eastlake, A. Panitz, The [[Internet Society]] (June 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; while it was reserved for the [[.edu]] domain by the [[Internet Corporation for Assigned Names and Numbers]] (ICANN) since 2000.

By implementing the reservation, the [[Internet Assigned Numbers Authority]] (IANA) made available domains for use in [[technical documentation|technical]] and [[software documentation]], manuals and sample software configurations. Thus, [[Technical writer|documentation writers]] can be sure to select a domain name without creating naming conflicts if end-users try to use the sample configurations or examples verbatim.

These domain names resolve to [[Internet Protocol]] (IP) addresses for [[IPv4]] and [[IPv6]] of a [[web server]] managed by [[ICANN]] and are digitally signed using [[Domain Name System Security Extensions|DNSSEC]].

The example domains have one subdomain name defined in the [[Domain Name System]]. For each domain, the [[third-level domain]] name ''www'' resolves to the same IPv4 and IPv6 addresses as the parent domains.

The '''Foreign and Commonwealth Office migrated archives''' are sensitive and incriminating collections of documents from Britain's former [[British Empire|colonial governments]] that were sent back to the UK (hence ''migrated'') on the eve of decolonisation for storage in the [[Foreign and Commonwealth Office|FCO]] archives to avoid their disclosure and subsequent embarrassment to [[Government of the United Kingdom|Her Majesty's Government]]. A great many similar documents were not repatriated, but instead destroyed.

[[Ben Macintyre]] of the ''[[The Times|Times]]'' summarised the procedure for [[Declassification|declassifying]] Foreign Office archival material as follows:
{{quotation|Under the [[Public Records Act 1958|Public Records Act]], documents are liable for release to the National Archives after 30 years. Up to 60 per cent of material is shredded and burnt at this stage. Less than 1 per cent is kept secret. Under the present rules, the Foreign Office may retain documents relating to intelligence, national security and defence. Some files transferred to the archives remain closed if they are deemed potentially harmful to international relations or contain personal information. Any decision to retain official documents is subject to scrutiny by the Lord Chancellor's Advisory Council on National Records and Archives, a panel chaired by Lord Neuberger of Abbotsbury, the Master of the Rolls.&lt;ref name = "Mac 16Apr2011"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article2988362.ece |last= Macintyre |first= Ben |date= 16 April 2011 |title= Mau Mau and so much more: inside the Foreign Office house of secrets |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 27 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} Once at Hanslope, reviewing documents for release is a job for seventeen part-time "sensitivity reviewers", mostly retired Foreign Office officials; it is rare for a file to be judged sensitive enough to warrant withholding it in entirety.&lt;ref name = "Mac 16Apr2011"/&gt; When it came to the migrated archives, however, the question of whether they fell within the scope of the Public Records Act 1958 was never answered definitively, and so they were conveniently left undisturbed in archival stasis.&lt;ref name = "Mac 16Apr2011"/&gt;

In 2005, two [[Freedom of information in the United Kingdom|Freedom of Information]] (FoI) requests were submitted to the FCO by researchers wanting [[Mau Mau]]-era government files. The second request was very specific, and did not warrant checking the migrated archives, but the first request should have warranted such a check, yet none was made.{{sfn|Cary|2011|pp=8–9}} More seriously still, in 2006, lawyers for [[Leigh Day &amp; Co|Leigh Day]], the legal firm representing former Mau Mau members who were attempting to sue the UK for their torture during the uprising, submitted a court disclosure request for "a final tranche of documents relating to the suppression of the Mau Mau" that the government was "refusing to release";{{sfn|Cary|2011|pp=9–10}} the FCO response explicitly denied the existence of this tranche of documents, i.e. the migrated archives, stating that all information they had held had been transferred to [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|The National Archives]] (TNA).{{sfn|Cary|2011|p=10}} The [[Treasury Solicitor's Department|Treasury Solicitor]]'s response to Leigh Day went even further, stating that not only were all relevant documents with TNA but that they were also in the public domain.{{sfn|Cary|2011|p=10}} It was only the persistence of a handful of FCO officials, notably Edward Inglett,&lt;ref name = "Times Inglett"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article2979182.ece |last= Macintyre |first= Ben |date= 9 April 2011 |title= One Foreign Office worker's dogged pursuit of 'missing' Mau Mau files |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 29 May 2012 |quote= If the 35-year-old Kenya desk officer at the Africa department of the Foreign and Commonwealth Office had not made it his mission to find the 1,500 missing files, they would still be lying in secret archives at Hanslope Park. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. Mr Inglett was told by IMG, repeatedly, that there was no trace of the files. Finally, on January 13, he announced that he was coming to Hanslope Park, with a lawyer, to find the files himself. Three days later, the files were found. }}&lt;/ref&gt; and a witness statement by [[University of Oxford|Oxford]] professor David Anderson in December 2010 alleging "systematic withholding by [[Government of the United Kingdom|HMG]] of 1,500 files in 300 boxes taking up 100 linear feet", that eventually resulted in the migrated archives coming to light in January 2011.&lt;ref name="times_12042011a"&gt;{{cite news| newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=12 April 2011 |title=Foreign Office says sorry for misplacing Mau Mau papers |author1=Ben Macintyre |author2=Billy Kenber |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article2981762.ece |accessdate=12 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon their 'discovery', [[Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs|Foreign Secretary]] [[William Hague]] requested Anthony Cary, a former British High Commissioner to Canada, to conduct an internal review into why the migrated archives had been spotlighted neither by the FoI requests nor by the initial Court Disclosure request.{{sfn|Cary|2011|p=1}} Cary reported the following month, and outlined the background as follows:
{{quotation|As British dependent territories came to independence decisions had to be taken about which papers to destroy, which to leave for successor administrations, and which to ship back to the UK. The general rule, as set out in a [[Colonial Office]] guidance telegram of 3 May 1961 on the 'disposal of classified records and accountable documents', was the successor Governments should not be given papers which:&lt;br /&gt;
* might embarrass HMG or other Governments;
* might embarrass members of the police, military forces, public servants or others eg police informers;
* might compromise sources of intelligence information; or
* might be used unethically by Ministers in the successor Government
In addition ''"There would be little object in handing over documents which would patently be of no value to the successor Government"''. A great many documents were destroyed on this basis, but others were returned to the UK. These became the so-called 'migrated archives', eventually totalling around 8,800 files.{{sfn|Cary|2011|p=1}}}}
{{quote box
| quote = Britain does not stand alone in facing such colonial legacies. Despite a public apology made in 2004 and the pledge of increased aid commitments to Namibia, the German Government still faces claims from the Herero peoples over a genocide inflicted in 1904. The Italians, too, are entangled in claims from their occupation of Libya. Silvio Berlusconi has gone further than the Germans, issuing an apology and promising a reparations payment of $5 billion.

The British will look toward the German and not the Italian model in handling the Mau Mau case. An apology should be issued to Kenya, and if it was to be given with a pledge of development assistance, then this might help to lay the ghosts of the past.

This should happen, but is it likely? It would imply an admission that torture had taken place under British rule in Kenya. We are making fools of ourselves by denying this. It is time to face up.&lt;ref name = "Anders 2009"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/world/africa/article2594283.ece |last= David Anderson |first= David |date= 23 June 2009 |title= Mau Mau claim will be fought every step of the way |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 26 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

One excuse offered by the FCO for their failure to consult the files was that the ownership of the papers was confused, that the FCO merely possessed stewardship, thus the archives had been considered "out of bounds" for FoI requests (the FCO were not the owners, so they did not have the right to go through the documents). Cary, however, managed to uncover the fact that this was not the case, that there had been "major exceptions to the general principle that these papers have been considered 'out of bounds'."{{sfn|Cary|2011|p=6}} Such an excuse became irrelevant after the 2006 legal request from Leigh Day because ''all'' documents have to be checked when it comes to court cases.{{sfn|Cary|2011|p=10}} "It was perhaps convenient to [think] that the migrated archives .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. did not need to be consulted for the purposes of FOI requests, while also being conscious of the files as a sort of guilty secret, of uncertain status and in the 'too difficult' tray", Cary concluded.{{sfn|Cary|2011|p=12}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-13336343 |title=Mau Mau torture files were 'guilty secret' |author=BBC News |date=9 May 2011 |accessdate=12 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The search that turned up the "lost" documents on Mau Mau revealed a second raft of documents had also been "lost" and, hopefully, also therefore awaited discovery.

===The process of removal/destruction===
Documents that were to be left to post-independence governments, known as "legacy files", were separated from "watch files", which were marked for destruction or repatriation. In Uganda, the process was codenamed Operation Legacy; in Kenya, the process was described as "a thorough purge" and directed by colonial Special Branch officers. Africans were forbidden from involvement: only "a servant of the Kenya government who is a British subject of European descent" could participate. The watch-file instructions also made clear to leave no trace of their existence to successor governments: "The legacy files must leave no reference to watch material. Indeed, the very existence of the watch series, though it may be guessed at, should never be revealed." If possible, a dummy file was inserted to ensure file and page numbering was uninterrupted by the cull; when too many dummies were needed, they simply removed or destroyed the entire section. In Kenya, instructions insisted that "emphasis is placed upon destruction", meaning much of the most shocking material was probably destroyed, and "the waste should be reduced to ash and the ashes broken up", so that not even a trace of the destruction was left. Large quantities of files were also "packed in weighted crates and dumped in very deep and current-free water at maximum practicable distance from the coast". Malaya's purge was less rigorous, and was facilitated by less experienced officials.&lt;ref name = "G docs 2012a"/&gt;&lt;ref name = "BBC 2012 docs"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-17734735 |last= Wallis |first= Holly |date= 18 April 2012 |title= British colonial files released following legal challenge |publisher= BBC News |accessdate= 29 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "G blog 2012"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2012/apr/18/national-archives-release-colonial-papers-live-blog#block-2 |last= Bowcott |first= Owen |date= 18 April 2012  |title= National Archives release colonial papers: 11.20am update |publisher= guardian.co.uk |accessdate= 30 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reaction and contents==
Cary's report and the documents initially released had shown that, on 3 December 1963, nine days before Kenya formally declared independence, three wooden packing crates containing 1,500 highly sensitive government files were loaded on to a British United Airways flight bound for Gatwick. On the eve of Kenya's independence, Colonial Secretary [[Iain Macleod]] ordered that sensitive colonial-government documentation be destroyed or flown out of the country because its disclosure "might embarrass Her Majesty's Government".&lt;ref name="times_05042011b"/&gt;{{sfn|Cary|2011|p=1}}&lt;ref name = "G docs 2012a"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/18/britain-destroyed-records-colonial-crimes |last1= Cobain |first1= Ian |last2= Bowcott |first2= Owen |last3= Norton-Taylor |first3= Richard |date= 18 April 2012 |title= Britain destroyed records of colonial crimes |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 26 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; "Embarrassment hardly covers it," remarked a ''Times'' editorial, noting that "the covert history of colonial administration in Kenya bears comparison to the methods of torture and summary execution in the French war in Algeria."&lt;ref name="times_05042011c"&gt;{{cite news| newspaper=[[The Times]] |date=5 April 2011 |title=Crimes of colonialism |author=Editorial |url=http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/leaders/article2972824.ece |accessdate=6 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2011, the government officially admitted for the first time not merely to having relevant Mau Mau documents, but that it had a total of 8,800 files from 37 ex-colonies,&lt;ref name = "admission 1"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article2974649.ece |last= Macintyre |first= Ben |date= 6 April 2011 |title= Britain's colonial files to be released |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 30 May 2012 |quote= Lord Howell confirmed .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. for the first time last night .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. that the Foreign Office holds 8,800 files from 37 former British administrations }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "admission 2"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article2974649.ece |last= Macintyre |first= Ben |date= 8 April 2011 |title= Archive at 'spook central' had secret Mau Mau files |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 30 May 2012 |quote= On Tuesday night, Lord Howell of Guildford, the Foreign and Commonwealth Office minister, made a statement acknowledging for the first time that it was 'general practice for the colonial administration to transfer to the United Kingdom, shortly before independence, selected documents which were not appropriate to hand on to the successor Government'. }}&lt;/ref&gt; which it would make public in batches from April 2012 to November 2013.&lt;ref name = "Econ 21Apr2012"&gt;{{cite journal |url= http://www.economist.com/node/21553073 |date= 21 April 2012 |title= End of empire |journal= The Economist |accessdate= 27 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Times'' opined: "Even given the Foreign and Commonwealth Office's apparent skill in such matters, it is quite a feat to ignore 300 boxes of documents filling 110ft of shelving for almost half a century."&lt;ref name = "T ed 07Apr2011"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/leaders/article2975963.ece |author= Editorial |date= 7 April 2011 |title= Dust and Denial |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 30 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

David Anderson, describing the Mau Mau initial 2011 revelations as just a start, emphasised that other former British domains, including Malaya, Cyprus, and the Gulf States, likewise await a final reckoning, and that colonial personnel and tactics subsequently made their way into the policing of [[The Troubles]].&lt;ref name = "DaAn 22Jul2011"/&gt; In particular, noted [[Aileen McColgan]], the techniques alleged in 1950s Kenya were refined into what are now known as the "[[five techniques]]" for use in internment in 1970s Northern Ireland: wall-standing, [[hooding]], subjection to noise, [[Sleep deprivation|deprivation of sleep]], and deprivation of food and drink. She went on to note: "The European Court of Human Rights ruled in 1977 that Britain had breached Article 3 of the European Convention on Human Rights, which prohibits torture and 'inhuman and degrading treatment', by the use of the five techniques in Northern Ireland. The Prime Minister, Edward Heath, told the Commons in 1972 that the techniques would [[Death of Baha Mousa|never again]] be used 'as an aid to interrogation', a commitment reiterated before the European Court."&lt;ref name = "McColgan 2012"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/law/article2977823.ece |last= McColgan |first= Aileen |date= 8 April 2011 |title= Inquiries won't show Britain at its best |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 29 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Cary investigation, Hague appointed [[University of Cambridge|Cambridge]]'s [[Tony Badger]] as "colonial files tsar" to oversee the review and transfer of the hidden files to the public domain. The Foreign Office duly released a first batch of more than 1,200 records from 12 former colonial territories in April 2012, a portion of some 10,000 files that Britain removed from 37 of its colonies.&lt;ref name = "Elkins 18Apr2012"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/politics/2012/apr/18/colonial-papers-fco-transparency-myth |last= Elkins |first= Caroline |date= 18 April 2012 |title= The colonial papers: FCO transparency is a carefully cultivated myth |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 7 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Badger described the migrated archives episode as "embarrassing, scandalous. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. These documents should have been in the public archives in the 1980s. It's long overdue."&lt;ref name = "G docs 2012a"/&gt; [[Harvard]]'s [[Caroline Elkins]] observed: "At the time, Britain was in the middle of parallel, massive cover-ups. While the government was besieged publicly with allegations of brutalities in the detention camps and the cover-up of systematised violence—and denying all allegations—it was culling and purging the record. The process—practised in other colonies as well—deliberately sought to remove incriminating evidence. So, too, did it seek to shape the future colonial archive and the realities it would produce."&lt;ref name = "Elkins 18Apr2012"/&gt;

The ''[[The Guardian|Guardian]]'' stated:
{{quote|Among the documents that appear to have been destroyed were: records of the abuse of Mau Mau insurgents detained by British colonial authorities, who were tortured and sometimes murdered; reports that may have detailed the alleged massacre of 24 unarmed villagers in Malaya by soldiers of the Scots Guards in 1948; most of the sensitive documents kept by colonial authorities in Aden, where the army's Intelligence Corps operated a secret torture centre for several years in the 1960s; and every sensitive document kept by the authorities in British Guiana, a colony whose policies were heavily influenced by successive US governments and whose post-independence leader was toppled in a coup orchestrated by the CIA.&lt;ref name = "G docs 2012a"/&gt;}}

As the ''Guardian'''s summary shows, even after the first 2012 release of Tony Badger's review, the FCO continued to deny the existence of documentation on the repeated British subversion of democracy in [[British Guiana]] in the 1950s and 1960s, though [[Richard Drayton]], [[Rhodes Professor of Imperial History]] at [[King's College London]], said this was simply not credible: "When Kenyan historians requested documents in the past, they were told repeatedly by the FCO that they had been destroyed, only for the FCO, under judicial pressure, to yield them. It is to be hoped that the FCO will at some point 'discover' its British Guiana archive. Already, under my pressure, having asserted that it held no British Guiana materials whatsoever, the FCO has found one document which describes 'a formidable schedule of documents which the Governor of British Guiana sent home in April 1966 showing how the accountable documents in his custody were disposed of&amp;nbsp;'."&lt;ref name = "Drayton Times"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/opinion/letters/article3388202.ece |title= Letter: The archives of Britain's colonial rulers |last= Drayton |first= Richard |date= 19 April 2012 |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 26 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Elkins agreed that it was "frankly impossible, given that there were well-established procedures for handling archives at decolonisation by the 1960s.

There was wide agreement that the FCO was still withholding files. [[Keith Flett]] said: "It is likely to be correct that despite William Hague's professed policy of transparency towards the release of government files from the colonial era that far from everything will be released and it will depend on the skills of historians to spot gaps in the record."&lt;ref name = "Guardian letters"/&gt; Elkins, who, like Anderson, is an expert witness for the Mau Mau legal action, highlighted the need for caution, and wrote of her involvement with trying to get files out of the foreign office for analysis back at Harvard: "This process has been anything but straightforward. Despite the legal context, the FCO has culled files, requiring multiple requests for full disclosure, and still files have not been forthcoming."&lt;ref name = "Elkins 18Apr2012"/&gt; Of the April 2012 release, she noted that it "excludes territories such as Palestine and Rhodesia. The Cyprus files exclude the period of the emergency. The Malaya files cover very little of the contested emergency years. The Kenya documents are a meagre subset of the files released (though culled) in the context of the Mau Mau case. For all 12 colonies covered in today's release, there appears to be a great deal pertaining to finance, tourism, administration and the like. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. The first release of the 'migrated archives' is, at first glance, lacking in substantive files, particularly for former colonies like Cyprus and Malaya where future lawsuits potentially loom."&lt;ref name = "Elkins 18Apr2012"/&gt;

[[Laleh Khalili]] of [[School of Oriental and African Studies|SOAS]] declared:
{{quote|The Aden material was ludicrous. Given the extent [of] torture and ill-treatment, detention and protest in that colony in its latter years, it was laughable to see the released files having to do with fisheries. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;.

Journalist Ian Cobain and others suggested that, owing to the nature of the British withdrawal from the [[Colony of Aden]], the incriminating material may, instead of being withheld, actually have been more comprehensively destroyed at the time of decolonisation, rather than migrated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2012/apr/18/national-archives-release-colonial-papers-live-blog#block-8 |last1= Cobain |first1= Ian |last2= Bowcott |first2= Owen |date= 18 April 2012 |title= National Archives release colonial papers: 3.51pm update |publisher= guardian.co.uk |accessdate= 30 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/blog/2012/apr/18/national-archives-release-colonial-papers-live-blog#block-9 |last1= Gooding |first1= Francis |last2= Bowcott |first2= Owen |date= 18 April 2012 |title= National Archives release colonial papers: 5.09pm update |publisher= guardian.co.uk |accessdate= 30 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Badger accepted that historians believed the FCO was "up to its old tricks again", and added: "Given the failure of the Foreign Office to acknowledge the existence of the migrated archives, I understand the legacy of suspicion. It is difficult to overestimate the degree of suspicion."&lt;ref name = "G docs 2012b"&gt;{{cite web |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/18/sins-colonialists-concealed-secret-archive |last1= Cobain |first1= Ian |last2= Norton-Taylor |first2= Richard |date= 18 April 2012 |title= Sins of colonialists lay concealed for decades in secret archive |publisher= guardian.co.uk |accessdate= 28 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ominously, the ''Guardian'' noted:
{{quote|In a number of colonies, as files were destroyed a certificate was completed and sent to London to show that the job had been done. Could these certificates also be stored at Hanslope Park, providing a glimpse of the contents of each file that was destroyed? The FCO was refusing to say on Tuesday, and insisted that any queries about such certificates should be the subject of an freedom of information request. Furthermore, Cary's report states that a separate inquiry is now examining the fate of a number of files that were lost or destroyed after they were returned to the UK.

Bennett said that "the British Army retained ultimate operational control over all security forces throughout the Emergency", and that its military intelligence operation worked "hand in glove" with the Kenyan Special Branch "including in screening and interrogations in centres and detention camps".&lt;ref name = "Torture 2011"/&gt;

The Kenyan government sent a letter to Hague insisting that the UK government was legally liable for the atrocities.&lt;ref name="times_05042011b"/&gt; The Foreign Office, however, reaffirmed its position that it was not, in fact, liable for colonial atrocities,&lt;ref name="times_05042011b"/&gt; and argued that the documents had not "disappeared" as part of a cover up.&lt;ref name="ft_050411"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ft.com/cms/s/0/c4fde0d2-5fb6-11e0-a718-00144feab49a.html |author=James Blitz |newspaper=[[Financial Times]] |date=5 April 2011 |title=Mau Mau case casts light on colonial records |accessdate=9 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nearly ten years before, in late 2002, as the BBC aired a damning documentary on British crimes committed during the rebellion and 6,000 depositions had been taken for the legal case, former district colonial officer John Nottingham had expressed concern that compensation be paid soon, since most victims were in their 80s and would soon pass away. He told the BBC: "What went on in the Kenya camps and villages was brutal, savage torture.

===Cyprus===
The release of material in 2011 sparked legal threats from veterans of [[EOKA#EOKA_allegations_of_torture_by_British_forces|EOKA]], who fought a campaign against the British occupation of Cyprus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article2983111.ece |last= Theodoulou |first= Michael |date= 13 April 2011 |title= Greek Cypriots intend to sue Britain over torture in 1950s uprising |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 9 May 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cyprus/eoka-fighters-sue-brits-over-torture/20110414 |last= Dewhurst |first= Patrick |date= 14 April 2011 |title= EOKA fighters to sue Brits over torture |newspaper= [[Cyprus Mail]] |accessdate= 9 May 2011 |deadurl= yes |archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20110518083948/http://www.cyprus-mail.com/cyprus/eoka-fighters-sue-brits-over-torture/20110414 |archivedate= 18 May 2011 |df= dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

David French also utilised the FCO files on Cyprus from the Migrated Archives to prove that the British did not intentionally use a colonial policy of 'Divide and Rule' to flare up Community Tensions on the Island.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=French|first1=David|title=British Intelligence and the Origins of the EOKA Emergency|url=http://bjmh.org.uk/index.php/bjmh/article/view/33/25|accessdate=8 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The April 2012 documents suggested that the British never intended peace talks with the rebels to succeed. The UK conspired with its [[Seychelles]] colony to deport the troublesome [[Makarios III|Archbishop Makarios]] even as the talks took place.&lt;ref name = "Cyprus Deport"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article3387222.ece |last= Malvern |first= Jack |date= 18 April 2012 |title= Secret plan to deport troublesome Cypriot |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 29 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Plans for chemical warfare testing in Botswana===
In 1943, Britain planned to test a "very virulent" type of poison gas in what was [[Bechuanaland Protectorate|Bechuanaland]] (now [[Botswana]]). On 6 June 1943, Harold Eddey Priestman, Administrative Secretary to the High Commissioner in South Africa, sent a hand-written letter, marked "secret and personal", to Aubrey Denzil Forsyth-Thompson, Resident Commissioner of Bechuanaland, in which he explained: "Certain types of poison gas are being manufactured in the union [South Africa] on UK account. The UK Ministry of Aircraft Production have now asked that practical trials may be carried out on a considerable scale. .&amp;nbsp;.&amp;nbsp;. We understand this poison gas is a very virulent type. It would therefore be necessary 1) to preclude access to the experimental area for a considerable time after the experiments had ceased. 2) and also to take into consideration any danger of the gas being carried by wind to areas adjacent to the experimental area."

The British looked for an "isolated area" within "reasonable distance" of an air base, that had a 15-mile buffer zone with no water sources, and that was "comparatively free from vegetation". Nowhere suitable could be found in South Africa, but they provisionally settled on somewhere in the [[Makgadikgadi Pan]]. Forsyth-Thompson later said that he was unwilling to consider testing in that area because it was surrounded by farms and it would be impossible to maintain secrecy. Under the codename of FORENSIC, air-launched trials were envisaged, but the approach of the rainy season prevented testing from going ahead. There is currently no evidence FORENSIC was actually executed.

Although it was never deployed, Britain stockpiled poison gas because of fears of its possible use by Germany.&lt;ref name = "Botswana"&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article3387203.ece |last1= Malvern |first1= Jack |last2= Kenber |first2= Billy |date= 18 April 2012 |title= Poison gas tests planned for site in Botswana |newspaper= [[The Times]] |accessdate= 29 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "G Bots chem"&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.theguardian.com/uk/2012/apr/18/britain-poison-gas-tests-botswana |last= Norton-Taylor |first= Richard |date= 18 April 2012 |title= Britain planned poison gas tests in Botswana, records reveal |newspaper= [[The Guardian]] |accessdate= 30 May 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Guide book-旅行ガイドブックPA024792.jpg|thumb|right|An assortment of guide books in [[Japan]]]]
A '''guide book''' or '''travel guide''' is "a book of information about a place designed for the use of visitors or tourists".&lt;ref&gt;''New Oxford American Dictionary''&lt;/ref&gt; It will usually include information about sights, accommodation, restaurants, transportation, and activities. Maps of varying detail and historical and cultural information are often included. Different kinds of guide books exist, focusing on different aspects of travel, from [[adventure travel]] to relaxation, or aimed at travelers with different incomes, or focusing on sexual orientation or types of diet.

Travel guides can also take the form of [[travel website]]s.

==History==
[[File:"A Tour Guide to the Famous Places of the Capital" from Akizato Rito's Miyako meisho zue (1787).jpg|thumb|A Japanese tourist consulting a tour guide and a guide book from Akizato Ritō's ''Miyako meisho zue'' (1787)]]
=== Antiquity ===
A forerunner of the guidebook was the ''[[periplus]]'', an itinerary from landmark to landmark of the ports along a coast. A ''periplus'' such as the ''[[Periplus of the Erythraean Sea]]'' was a manuscript document that listed, in order, the ports and coastal landmarks, with approximate intervening distances, that the captain of a vessel could expect to find along a shore. This work was possibly written in the middle of the 1st century CE.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A Source Book in Geography|first=George|last=Kish|page=21|publisher=Harvard University Press|location=Cambridge|year=1978|isbn=0-674-82270-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; It served the same purpose as the later Roman [[itinerarium]] of road stops.

The ''periegesis'', or "progress around" was an established ''literary'' genre during the Hellenistic age. A lost work by Agaclytus describing [[Olympia, Greece|Olympia]] ({{lang|grc|περὶ Ὀλυμπίας}}) is referred to by the [[Suda]] and [[Patriarch Photios I of Constantinople|Photius]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Suda]], ''s.v.'' {{lang|grc|Κυψελιδῶν}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Smith|first=William|author-link=William Smith (lexicographer)|contribution=|editor-last=Smith|editor-first=William|title=[[Dictionary of Greek and Roman Biography and Mythology]]|volume=1|pages=57|publisher=Agaclytus|place=[[Boston]]|year=1870|contribution-url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Dionysius Periegetes]] (literally, Dionysius the Traveller) was the author of a description of the habitable world in [[Greek language|Greek]] [[hexameter]] verse written in a terse and elegant style, intended for the  ''[[klismos]]'' traveller rather than the actual tourist on the ground; he is believed to have worked in [[Alexandria]] and to have flourished around the time of [[Hadrian]]. An early "remarkably well-informed and interesting guidebook" was the ''Hellados Periegesis'' (''Descriptions of Greece'') of [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]] of the 2nd century A.D.&lt;ref&gt;J. A. Cuddon, ''The Penguin Dictionary of Literary Terms and Literary Theory''. London: Penguin Books, 1999,p. 369.&lt;/ref&gt; This most famous work is a guide to the interesting places, works of architecture, sculpture, and curious customs of [[Ancient Greece]], and is still useful to Classicists today. With the advent of Christianity, the guide for the [[Europe|European]] [[religious]] [[pilgrim]] became a useful guidebook. An early account is that of the pilgrim [[Egeria (pilgrim)|Egeria]], who visited the Holy Land in the 4th century CE and left a detailed itinerary.

In the [[Islamic Golden Age|medieval Arab world]], guide books for travelers in search of [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifacts]] and treasures were written by Arabic treasure hunters, magicians, and [[Alchemy and chemistry in medieval Islam|alchemists]]. This was particularly the case in [[History of Arab Egypt|Arab Egypt]], where treasure hunters were eager to find valuable [[ancient Egypt]]ian antiquities. Some of the books claimed to be imbued with magic that could dispel the magical barriers believed to be protecting the artifacts.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Egyptology: The Missing Millennium: Ancient Egypt in Medieval Arabic Writings|first1=Okasha|last1=El Daly|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2004|isbn=1844720632|page=36}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Travelogues===
Travel literature became popular during the [[Song Dynasty]] (960–1279) of medieval [[China]]. The genre was called 'travel record literature' (youji wenxue), and was often written in [[narrative]], [[prose]], [[essay]] and [[diary]] style. Travel literature authors such as [[Fan Chengda]] (1126–1193) and [[Xu Xiake]] (1587–1641) incorporated a wealth of [[geographical]] and [[topographical]] information into their writing, while the 'daytrip essay' ''[[Su Shi#Travel record literature|Record of Stone Bell Mountain]]'' by the noted poet and statesman [[Su Shi]] (1037–1101) presented a philosophical and moral argument as its central purpose.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1= Hargett|first1= James M. |year=1985 |title= Some Preliminary Remarks on the Travel Records of the Song Dynasty (960-1279)|journal= Chinese Literature: Essays, Articles, Reviews|volume= 7|issue= 1/2|pages=67–93 |jstor=495194 |doi= 10.2307/495194}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the West, the guidebook developed from the published personal experiences of aristocrats who traveled through Europe on the [[Grand Tour]]. As the appreciation of art, architecture and antiquity became ever-more essential ingredients of the noble upbringing so they predominated in the guidebooks, particularly those devoted to the Italian peninsula. [[Richard Lassels]] (1603-1668) wrote a series of manuscript guides which were eventually published posthumously in Paris and London (1670) as ''The Voyage of Italy''.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Chaney]], ''The Grand Tour and the Great Rebellion'' (Geneva-Turin, 1985)&lt;/ref&gt; Grand Tour guidebooks poured off the presses throughout the eighteenth century, those such as [[Patrick Brydone]]'s ''A Tour Through Sicily and Malta'' being read by many who never left England.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Chaney|E. Chaney]], ''The Evolution of the Grand Tour'', revised ed. (Routledge, 2000)&lt;/ref&gt; 

An important transitional figure from the idiosyncratic style of the Grand Tour travelogues to the more informative and impersonal guidebook was [[Mariana Starke]]. Her 1824 guide to travel in France and Italy served as an essential companion for British travelers to the Continent in the early 19th century. She recognized that with the growing numbers of Britons traveling abroad after 1815 the majority of her readers would now be in family groups and on a budget. She therefore included for the first time a wealth of advice on luggage, obtaining passports, the precise cost of food and accommodation in each city and even advice on the care of invalid family members. She also devised a system of !!! exclamation mark ratings, a forerunner of today's [[Star (classification)|star ratings]]. Her books, published by [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]], served as a template for later guides.

In the [[United States]], the first published guidebook was Gideon Minor Davison's ''The Fashionable Tour'', published in 1822, and Theodore Dwight's ''The Northern Traveller'' and Henry Gilpin's ''The Northern Tour'', both from 1825.&lt;ref name=gassan&gt;Richard Gassan, "The First American Tourist Guidebooks: Authorship and Print Culture of the 1820s," ''Book History'' 8 (2005), pp. 51-74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern guidebook===
[[File:John Murray b1788.jpg|thumb|left|150px|[[John Murray (1778-1843)|John Murray]].]]
The modern guidebook emerged in the 1830s, with the burgeoning market for long distance tourism. The publisher [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray]] began printing the ''[[Murray's Handbooks for Travellers]]'' in London from 1836.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title='What Ought to Be Seen': Tourists' Guidebooks and National Identities in Modern Germany and Europe |author= Rudy Koshar |journal= Journal of Contemporary History |volume= 33 |date=July 1998 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The series covered tourist destinations in Europe, Asia and northern Africa, and he introduced the concept of "sights" which he rated in terms of their significance using stars for Starke's exclamation points. According to scholar James Buzard, the Murray style "exemplified the exhaustive rational planning that was as much an ideal of the emerging tourist industry as it was of British commercial and industrial organization generally."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Uses of Romanticism: Byron and the Victorian Continental Tour |author=James Buzard |journal= Victorian Studies |volume= 35 |date=Autumn 1991 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Karl Baedeker.jpg|thumb|150px|[[Karl Baedeker]].]]
In Germany, [[Karl Baedeker]] acquired the publishing house of Franz Friedrich Röhling in Koblenz, which in 1828 had published a handbook for travellers by Professor Johannes August Klein entitled ''Rheinreise von Mainz bis Cöln; ein Handbuch für Schnellreisende'' (''A Rhine Journey from [[Mainz]] to [[Cologne]]; A Handbook for Travellers on the Move''). He published this book with little changes for the next ten years, which provided the seeds for Baedeker's new approach to travel guides. After Klein died, he decided to publish a new edition in 1839, to which he added many of his own ideas on what he thought a travel guide should offer the traveller. Baedeker's ultimate aim was to free the traveller from having to look for information anywhere outside the travel guide; whether about routes, transport, accommodation, restaurants, tipping, sights, walks or prices. Baedeker emulated the style of [[John Murray (publisher)|John Murray's]] guidebooks,&lt;ref name="eb1911"&gt;{{Cite EB1911|wstitle=Baedeker, Karl}}&lt;/ref&gt; but included unprecedented detailed information.

In 1846, Baedeker introduced his star ratings for sights, attractions and lodgings, following Mrs. Starke's and Murray's. This edition was also his first 'experimental' red guide. He also decided to call his travel guides 'handbooks', following the example of [[John Murray III]]. Baedeker's early guides had tan covers, but from 1856 onwards, Murray's red bindings and gilt lettering became the familiar hallmark of all Baedeker guides as well, and the content became famous for its clarity, detail and accuracy.&lt;ref name=buzzard&gt;James Buzzard. "The Grand Tour and after (1660-1840)" in ''The Cambridge Companion to Travel Writing'' (2002), pp. 48-50.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:1871 Murrays Handbook for Travellers in Turkey.png|thumb|right|Cover of ''Handbook for Travellers in Turkey,'' 1871|200px]]
Baedeker and Murray produced impersonal, objective guides; works prior to this combined factual information and personal sentimental reflection.&lt;ref name=buzzard/&gt; The availability of the books by Baedeker and Murray helped sharpen and formalize the complementary genre of the personal [[Travel literature|travelogue]], which was freed from the burden of serving as a guide book.&lt;ref name=buzzard/&gt; The Baedeker and Murray guide books were hugely popular and were standard resources for travelers well into the 20th century. As [[William Wetmore Story]] said in the 1860s, "Every Englishman abroad carries a Murray for information, and a [[George Gordon Byron, 6th Baron Byron|Byron]] for sentiment, and finds out by them what he is to know and feel by every step." During World War I the two editors of Baedeker's English-language titles left the company and acquired the rights to [[Murray's Handbooks for Travellers|Murray's Handbooks]]; the resulting guide books, called the [[Blue Guides]] to distinguish them from the red-covered Baedekers, constituted one of the major guide book series for much of the 20th century and are still published today.

===Post-WW2===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:English language travel guidebooks.jpg|thumb|left|English-language guidebooks]] --&gt;
Following [[World War II]], two new names emerged which combined European and American perspectives on international travel.  [[Eugene Fodor (writer)|Eugene Fodor]], a Hungarian-born [[travel writing|author of travel articles]], who had emigrated to the United States before the war, wrote guidebooks which introduced English-reading audiences to continental Europe.  [[Arthur Frommer]], an American soldier stationed in Europe during the [[Korean War]], used his experience traveling around the Continent as the basis for ''[[Europe on $5 a Day]]'' (1957), which introduced readers to options for budget travel in Europe.  Both authors' guidebooks became the foundations for extensive series, eventually covering destinations around the world, including the United States.  In the decades that followed, [[Let's Go Travel Guides|Let's Go]], [[Lonely Planet]], [[Insight Guides]], [[Rough Guides]], and a wide variety of similar travel guides were developed, with varying focuses.

==Mountain guides==
[[File:Snowdonia scrambling.jpg|thumb|right|Scrambling on [[Crib Goch]], [[Snowdonia]], [[Wales]]]]
Specialist guides for mountains have a long history owing to the special needs of [[mountaineering]], [[climbing]], [[hill walking]] and [[scrambling]]. The guides by [[W A Poucher]] for example, are widely used for the hill regions of [[United Kingdom|Britain]]. There are many more special guides to the numerous climbing grounds in Britain published by the [[Climbers Club]], for example.

==Digital world==
With the emergence of digital technology, many publishers turned to electronic distribution, either in addition to or instead of print publication.  This can take the form of downloadable documents for reading on a portable computer or hand held device such a [[PDA]] or [[iPod]], or online information accessible via a web site.  This enabled guidebook publishers to keep their information more current.  Traditional guide book incumbents [[Lonely Planet]], [[Frommers]], [[Rough Guides]], and [[In Your Pocket City Guides]], and newcomers such as [[Schmap]] or [[Ulysses Travel Guides]] are now offering travel guides for [[download]].  New online and interactive guides such as [[Tripadvisor]], [[Wikivoyage]], and [[Travellerspoint]] enable individual travelers to share their own experiences and contribute information to the guide.  Wikivoyage, CityLeaves, and Travellerspoint make the entire contents of their guides updatable by users, and make the information in their guides available as [[open content]], free for others to use.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12410">The '''Harvard–Yenching Classification System''' is a  library classification system for Chinese language materials in the United States of America. It was devised by [[Alfred Kaiming Chiu]]&lt;ref&gt;{{zh|t=裘開明 | s=裘开明 |p=Qiú Kāimíng|w=Ch'iu&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; K'ai&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;-Ming&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.&lt;/ref&gt; (1898–1977). The system was primarily created for the classification of Chinese language materials in the [[Harvard–Yenching Library]] which was founded in 1927 at the [[Harvard–Yenching Institute]].&lt;ref&gt;Eugene W. Wu, "The Founding of the Harvard–Yenching Library," ''Journal of East Asian Libraries'' 101.1  (1993):  65-69.     [http://scholarsarchive.byu.edu/jeal/vol1993/iss101/16/]&lt;/ref&gt;

During that early period other systems, such as the early edition of the [[Library of Congress Classification]], did not consist of appropriate subject headings to classify the Chinese language materials, particularly the ancient published materials.  As many American libraries started to collect the ancient and contemporary published materials from China, a number of American libraries subsequently followed Harvard University to adopt Harvard–Yenching classification system, such as the East Asian Library of the University of California in Berkeley, Columbia University, The University of Chicago, Washington University in St. Louis etc.

In addition to American libraries, the libraries of other universities in the world including England, Australia, New Zealand, Hong Kong, Singapore etc. also followed Harvard University to adopt the system.  During the period from the 1930s to the 1970s, the use of the system became popular for classifying not only Chinese language materials but also other East Asian materials including Korean and Japanese language materials.

During the period from the 1970s to the 1980s, a comprehensive subset of subject headings for Chinese language materials was gradually established in the Library of Congress Classification System so that almost a full spectrum of ancient and contemporary Chinese topics can be widely covered. As a result of this, the Library of Congress Classification System eventually replaced the Harvard–Yenching Classification System for all Chinese language materials acquired after the 1970s in many American Libraries.

Though the system has largely been phased out, the system is still being used in some libraries for Chinese language materials acquired prior to the Library of Congress update. Such previously acquired books are normally stored in separate stacks in libraries. However, some of the university libraries in the Commonwealth countries of the United Kingdom such as England, Australia and New Zealand still continue to use the Harvard–Yenching system; for example, the Institute for Chinese Studies Library of the University of Oxford, University of Sydney, and University of Auckland.

In [[computing]], the '''Hesiod''' [[name service]] originated in [[Project Athena]] (1983–1991). It uses [[Domain Name System|DNS]] functionality to provide access to [[database]]s of [[information]] that change infrequently. In [[Unix]] environments it often serves to distribute information kept in the &lt;tt&gt;/etc/passwd&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;/etc/group&lt;/tt&gt;, and &lt;tt&gt;/etc/printcap&lt;/tt&gt; files, among others.
Frequently an [[Lightweight Directory Access Protocol|LDAP]] server is used to distribute the same kind of information that Hesiod does. However, because Hesiod can leverage existing DNS servers, deploying it to a network is fairly easy.

In a [[Unix-like]] system users usually have a line in the /etc/passwd file for each local user like:

 foo:x:100:10:Foo Bar:/home/foo:/bin/sh

This line is composed of seven colon-separated fields which hold the following data:
# user login name (string);
# password hash or "x" if [[shadow password]] file is in use (string);
# user id (unsigned integer);
# user's primary group id (unsigned integer);
# [[Gecos field]] (four comma separated fields, string);
# user home directory (string);
# user login shell (string).

This system works fine for a small number of users on a small number of machines.  But when more users start using more machines having this information managed in one location becomes critical.  This is where Hesiod enters.

Instead of having this information stored on every machine, Hesiod stores it in records on your DNS server.  Then each client can query the DNS server for this information instead of looking for it locally.  In [[BIND]] the records for the above user might look something like:

 foo.passwd.ns.example.net  HS  TXT  "foo:x:100:10:Foo Bar:/home/foo:/bin/sh"
 100.passwd.ns.example.net  HS  TXT  "foo:x:100:10:Foo Bar:/home/foo:/bin/sh"
 100.uid.ns.example.net     HS  TXT  "foo:x:100:10:Foo Bar:/home/foo:/bin/sh"

There are three records because the system needs to be able to access the information in different ways.  The first line supports looking up the user by their login name and the second two allow it to look up information by the user's uid. Note the use of the ''HS'' class instead of ''IN'' as might be expected. The [[Domain Name System]] has a special [[Domain Name System#DNS resource records|class of service]] for Hesiod's purpose.

On the client side some configuration also needs to happen.  The /etc/hesiod.conf file for this setup might look something like:

 rhs=.example.net
 lhs=.ns
 classes=HS,IN

Also make sure the /etc/resolv.conf file is using the name servers that have the Hesiod records. Once this is configured one can test the setup using the ''hesinfo'' program:

 hesinfo foo passwd

should return

 foo:x:100:10:Foo Bar:/home/foo:/bin/sh

What happens here is that the ''foo'' and the ''passwd'' are combined with the ''lhs'' and ''rhs'' values in the /etc/hesiod.conf file to create a fully qualified name of ''foo.passwd.ns.hesiod''.  The DNS server is then queried for this entry and returns the value of that record.

'''Isioma Nkemdilim Nkiruka Daniel''' (born 1981) is a [[Nigeria]]n journalist whose 2002 newspaper article comment involving the [[Islamic prophet]] [[Muhammad]] sparked the [[Miss World riots]] and caused a [[fatwa]] to be issued on her life.

&lt;/ref&gt; Her first job as a journalist was at ''[[Thisday]]'', a [[Lagos]]-based national daily newspaper.&lt;ref name="cbc_naivety"/&gt; As a fashion writer, she authored a November 16, 2002 comment piece on [[Miss World]] [[beauty pageant]] that was to be held in Nigeria later that year. Addressing opposition to the contest from the Nigerian Muslim community, she made the following remark:

:"The Muslims thought it was immoral to bring 92 women to Nigeria and ask them to revel in vanity. What would Mohammed think? In all honesty, he would probably have chosen a wife from one of them."&lt;ref name="guardian_fatwa"/&gt;

According to Daniel, the sentence was added at the last minute; she thought it was "funny, light hearted" and "didn't see it as anything anybody should take seriously or cause much fuss".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release

Daniel resigned from the newspaper the day after her article appeared.&lt;ref name="guardian_fatwa"/&gt; Soon after, fearing for her safety and worried about the impending interrogation by the [[State Security Service (Nigeria)|Nigerian state security]], she left the country for [[Benin]].&lt;ref name="guardian_match"/&gt;

On 26 November 2002 an Islamist government of [[Zamfara]], Nigerian northern state, issued a fatwa against Isioma Daniel; in words of Zamfara deputy governor [[Mamuda Aliyu Shinkafi]], later broadcast on the local radio:

:"Like [[Salman Rushdie]], the blood of Isioma Daniel can be shed. It is abiding on all Muslims wherever they are to consider the killing of the writer as a religious duty."&lt;ref name="guardian_fatwa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc_fatwa"/&gt;

While the Nigerian government denounced the judgement as "unconstitutional"&lt;ref name="guardian_fatwa"/&gt; and "null and void",&lt;ref name="bbc_fatwa"/&gt; Muslim leaders were divided over its validity, some arguing that the subsequent retraction and apology meant that the fatwa was inappropriate.&lt;ref name="bbc_fatwa"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc_controversy"&gt;{{cite news

Thus [[Lateef Adegbite]], Secretary-General of the Nigerian Supreme Council for Islamic Affairs, was quick to reject the death penalty since Daniel was not Muslim and the newspaper had apologised publicly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

'''DeAlva Eyvonnie Sibley''' (May 25, 1922 &amp;ndash; July 20, 1998), better known by her ring name of '''June Byers''', was an [[United States|American]] women's [[professional wrestling|professional wrestler]] famous in the 1950s and early 1960s. She held the [[Women's World Championship]] for ten years and is a member of the [[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame]].

==Early life==
Born in [[Houston, Texas]], the [[tomboy]]ish Sibley grew up around wrestling. Her uncle, Ottoway Roberts,&lt;ref name="pwiwow"&gt;{{cite journal|last=|first=|date=1996|title=The 50 Greatest Women Wrestlers of All-Time|journal=[[Pro Wrestling Illustrated]] Presents: The Women of Wrestling|publisher=Kappa Publishing|volume=1|issue=1|page=7}}&lt;/ref&gt; worked for local wrestling promoter Morris Siegel, and as she got older, she often hung around the wrestlers and asked them to teach her their moves.&lt;ref name=WPW&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.womens-pro-wrestling.com/byers.htm |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/19991011224939/http://womens-pro-wrestling.com/byers.htm |archive-date=October 11, 1999 |title=June Byers at womens-pro-wrestling.com |dead-url=yes |access-date=September 8, 2016 |df= }}. WWI Productions. Retrieved on 2001-11-23.&lt;/ref&gt; On one occasion while DeAlva was playing around in the ring, the women's wrestling promoter [[Billy Wolfe]] happened to see her and recognized her potential.&lt;ref name=WPW/&gt; Already divorced once and facing poverty,&lt;ref name=PWHOF&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pwhf.org/halloffamers/bios/byers.asp |title=June Byers at Professional Wrestling Hall Of Fame |publisher=[[Professional Wrestling Hall of Fame and Museum]] |accessdate=2007-11-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071007104447/http://www.pwhf.org/halloffamers/bios/byers.asp |archivedate=2007-10-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; she accepted Wolfe's offer to be trained as a professional wrestler.

==Professional wrestling career==
Taking her family nickname of "June" and her ex-husband's last name of "Byers" for her ring name, Sibley made her professional debut in 1944. She spent the first years of her career traveling the country in Wolfe's promotion, sometimes winning preliminary matches but regularly losing to the more established stars such as [[Mae Young]] and champion [[Mildred Burke]]. Slowly rising in the ranks, she first won gold in 1952 when she and partner [[Millie Stafford]] won the Tag Title over Young and [[Ella Waldek]].&lt;ref name=WPW/&gt;

That same year Mildred Burke had a bitter falling-out with husband Wolfe and departed the promotion, leaving the world title vacant. On June 14, 1953, a still relatively unknown Byers won a 13-woman tournament in [[Baltimore]] to claim the belt. She quickly became a popular [[face (professional wrestling)|fan favorite]] champion, even appearing as a contestant on the popular game shows ''[[What's My Line?]]'' and ''[[I've Got A Secret]]'' on August 16, 1953.&lt;ref name=IMDB&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/name/nm1296643/ June Byers at imdb.com]. Retrieved on 2007-11-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

After a year of tense negotiation, Wolfe finally coaxed Burke into meeting Byers in a definitive [[two out of three falls match]] on August 20, 1954 in [[Atlanta, Georgia]].&lt;ref name=WPW/&gt; Byers won the first fall, and then the match was called after an hour during the second fall. In the book ''The Queen of the Ring'' author Jeff Leen writes that despite battling injuries, Burke was able to hold Byers to a stalemate after dropping the first fall and thus deprive her of the second fall she needed to truly defeat Burke. Despite the inconclusive finish, the Atlanta Athletic Commission eventually awarded the match to Byers.&lt;ref name=WPW/&gt; Burke angrily returned to her own promotion, the World Women's Wrestling Association, where she held its title and billed herself as world champion. She maintained later that she had dropped the first fall with the intent to compete stronger in the second, and it is noted that Wolfe used all possible connections to try to get a win for his new star (and daughter-in-law) Byers.&lt;ref name=p292&gt;{{cite book|title=National Wrestling Alliance: The Untold Story of the Monopoly that Strangled Pro Wrestling|page=292|last=Hornbaker|first=Tim|publisher=[[ECW Press]]|year=2007|isbn=978-1-55022-741-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Byers, for her part, stressed that "Mildred claims she wasn't defeated, but I pinned her in the first fall. During the second fall, she left the ring and refused to come back. Regardless of what she told people, it was a shoot."&lt;ref name=WPW/&gt; Whatever the truth, the match outcome was satisfactory enough for the media to discredit Burke and acknowledge Byers as the legitimate world champion.&lt;ref name=p292/&gt; Jeff Leen's account in ''Queen of the Ring'' contradicts Byer's claims about Burke leaving the ring and refusing to return. Furthermore, Leen details how Billy Wolfe had a great deal to do with putting Byers over as the "winner" and he quotes the ring announcer following the match as saying, "Commissioner stops the bout. Mildred Burke is still officially champion of the world".

As the face of women's wrestling for the next decade, Byers's athleticism and technical skills did much to open new markets for women's wrestling and improve its perception in the eyes of the public as being more than mere tawdry spectacle.&lt;ref name=PWHOF/&gt; Complementing her repertoire of scientific moves was her toughness in an age of very tough women, and she was known for working incredibly [[stiff (professional wrestling)|stiff]] against newcomers: one such wrestler recalled getting a broken nose and two black eyes from Byers intentionally punching her in the face.&lt;ref name=glory&gt;[http://www.glorywrestling.com/gg/EthelBrown/EB.asp Glory Wrestling.] Retrieved on 2007-11-11.&lt;/ref&gt; Byers wrestled many matches with [[Penny Banner]], and the two had great respect for one another: Byers ranked Banner as among her toughest opponents,&lt;ref name=PWHOF/&gt; while Banner named Byers the greatest of all time.&lt;ref name=OWOW&gt;[http://www.onlineworldofwrestling.com/columns/interviews/pennybanner.html Online World Of Wrestling interview with Penny Banner, 2003]. Retrieved 2007-11-11.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1956, the Baltimore Athletic Commission stripped Byers of the NWA Championship when she announced her plans to retire as champion.&lt;ref name=moolah9798&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fabulous Moolah: First Goddess of the Squared Circle|last=Ellison|first=Lillian|authorlink=The Fabulous Moolah|pages=97–98|year=2002|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-0603-9397-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A thirteen-woman battle royal was used to determine the new champion.&lt;ref name=moolah9798/&gt; After [[The Fabulous Moolah]] won the championship, Byers came out of retirement to challenge her for the title, but Byers lost the match.&lt;ref name=moolah105107&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fabulous Moolah: First Goddess of the Squared Circle|last=Ellison|first=Lillian|authorlink=The Fabulous Moolah|pages=105–107|year=2002|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-0603-9397-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 31, 2017, Byers was posthumously inducted into the [[WWE Hall of Fame]] as a part of the Legacy wing.

[[The Fabulous Moolah]] alleges that while traveling with Billy Wolfe's troupe of female wrestlers, Byers often slept with Wolfe (despite his marriage to Burke) in order to get better bookings.&lt;ref name=moolah4546&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fabulous Moolah: First Goddess of the Squared Circle|last=Ellison|first=Lillian|authorlink=The Fabulous Moolah|pages=45–46|year=2002|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-0603-9397-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon Wolfe's death, Byers moved to [[St. Louis]] to work for promoter Sam Meneker, who became her third husband. In 1963, while attempting to drive after being hit in the head with a [[Coca-Cola|Coke]] bottle, Byers experienced quadruple vision and collided with a tree.&lt;ref name=induct&gt;[http://www.pwhf.org/2006inductees/2006article.asp 2006 Pro Wrestling Hall Of Fame induction ceremony report.] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070804221248/http://www.pwhf.org/2006inductees/2006article.asp |date=August 4, 2007 }} Retrieved on 2007-11-11.&lt;/ref&gt; The leg damage from the auto accident cut her career short at age 41 and forced her to retire on January 1, 1964.&lt;ref name=WPW/&gt; In her later life, she had double vision from the incident.&lt;ref name=moolah202&gt;{{cite book|title=The Fabulous Moolah: First Goddess of the Squared Circle|last=Ellison|first=Lillian|authorlink=The Fabulous Moolah|page=202|year=2002|publisher=[[HarperCollins]]|isbn=978-0-0603-9397-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Byers returned to Texas after retirement from the ring, becoming a [[real estate]] agent.&lt;ref name=WPW/&gt; She had two children, Billy and Jewel. Her son was fatally electrocuted in an accident, and Byers was reportedly never the same afterward.&lt;ref name=PWHOF/&gt; She died of [[pneumonia]] at her Houston home in 1998.

'''Louis R.

Huntington]].&lt;ref name=am /&gt;

==Early life and education==
Ehrich was born in [[Albany, New York]] on January 23, 1849, to Joseph and Rebecca Sporburg Ehrich.&lt;ref name=am /&gt; He attended [[Hopkins Grammar School]] in [[New Haven, CT]] before graduating from Yale University in 1869.&lt;ref name=am /&gt;&lt;ref name=ya&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Yale University |first1= |last2= |first2= |date=1912 |title=Obituary Record of Yale Graduates, 1911-1912 |url=http://mssa.library.yale.edu/obituary_record/1859_1924/1911-12.pdf |journal=Bulletin of Yale University |volume=8 |issue=9 |pages=230–232 |doi= |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He went on to study at the University of Berlin, and divided his time between New York and Europe for much of the 1870s and 1880s, studying the Renaissance and Baroque paintings that would become his livelihood.&lt;ref name=am /&gt;

==Career==
===Politics and Commerce===
After graduating from Yale, Ehrich helped his brother William run the Ehrich Brothers Dry Goods Store (est. 1857). Telling the New York Tribune that the stress of retail had left William with a "shattered constitution," Louis resigned from his own position in 1886.&lt;ref name=nyt1&gt;{{cite news |last=Gray |first=Christopher |date={{date|1995-2-12|mdy}} |title=Streetscapes/The Ehrich Brothers Store; Restoration for the Final Stretch of the Ladies' Mile|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1995/02/12/realestate/streetscapes-ehrich-brothers-store-restoration-for-final-stretch-ladies-mile.html?mcubz=2 |work=New York Times |location=New York City, New York |access-date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=am /&gt; His health led him to relocate to [[Colorado Springs]] in 1889, where he served as vice president of the [[Colorado Springs and Interurban Railway]] company, director of the First National Bank, and president of the Board of Trade of Colorado Springs, acting in several smaller business ventures simultaneously.&lt;ref name= ya /&gt; Along with his interest in trade and land development, Ehrich was heavily involved in politics for much of his life. Throughout the 1890s and early 1910s, he was an executive member of the [[American Anti-Imperialist League|Anti-Imperialist League]] and the [[Gold Democrats]] Party,&lt;ref name=am /&gt; as well as an advocate for [[free trade]],&lt;ref name=ia&gt;{{cite book |last=Ehrich |first=Louis R. |orig-year=First published July 5, 1911 |date={{date|2015-7|mdy}} |title=Free Trade Vs.

He wrote and published ''The Question of Silver''&lt;ref name=sil&gt;{{cite book |last=Ehrich |first=Louis R. |date=1891 |title=The Question of Silver: comprising a summary of the legislation in the United States, together with a practical analysis of the present situation, and of the arguments of the advocates of unlimited silver coinage |url=http://www.worldcat.org/title/silver-question/oclc/43330561 |location=New York, London |publisher=G.P. Putnam's Sons |page= |isbn= |author-link= }}&lt;/ref&gt; to further explicate his views on the [[Free Silver]] issue. Despite his early opposition to [[William Jennings Bryan]] because of their differing opinions on the [[Gold Standard]], Ehrich reconciled with him by the date of the [[United States presidential election, 1900|1900 election]], largely thanks to Bryan's firm stance against the [[American annexation of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name=cc /&gt;

===Ehrich Galleries===
In the mid 1890s, Ehrich combined his interest in [[European painting]]s with his knowledge of business to found the Ehrich Galleries in [[New York City]]. Located on [[Fifth Avenue]], the galleries originally specialized in [[Old Masters]] exclusively.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=An exhibition of Spanish paintings of the sixteenth, seventeenth and eighteenth centuries: Jan. 13-31|url=https://archive.org/details/frick-31072001509290 |location=New York |publisher=Electronic Reproduction by The Frick Collection |page= |date=2012 |isbn=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ehrich's judgement was purportedly esteemed by well-known art expert [[Bernard Berenson]].&lt;ref name=bb&gt;{{cite journal |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date={{date|1905-3-1|mdy}} |title=Among the Dealers |jstor=25435451 |journal=The Collector and Art Critic |volume=3 |issue=2 |pages=26 |doi= }}&lt;/ref&gt; He provided art to individuals such as [[Samuel Untermyer]],&lt;ref name=nyt6 /&gt; [[Stanford White]],&lt;ref name=nyt6&gt;{{cite news |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt;|date={{date|1906-3-22|mdy}} |title=SEVENTY-FOUR PICTURES BRING TOTAL OF $63,635; Samuel Untermyer Pays $8,000 for a Jean Marc Nattier.

==Personal life==
Ehrich married Henrietta Minsezheimer in 1874.&lt;ref name=am /&gt; In addition to Harold and Walter, who ran Ehrich Galleries after Louis's death, they had a daughter named Leah.

'''Marble Palace''' (Мраморный дворец) is one of the first [[Neoclassical architecture|Neoclassical]] [[palace]]s in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]]. It is situated between the [[Field of Mars (St Petersburg)|Field of Mars]] and [[Palace Quay]], slightly to the east from [[New Michael Palace]].

==Design and pre-1917 owners==

The palace was built by Count [[Grigory Orlov]], the favorite of Empress [[Catherine II of Russia|Catherine the Great]] and the most powerful Russian nobleman of the 1760s. Construction started in 1768 to designs by [[Antonio Rinaldi (architect)|Antonio Rinaldi]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saint-petersburg.com/palaces/marble-palace/&lt;/ref&gt; who previously had helped decorate the grand palace at [[Caserta Palace|Caserta]] near [[Naples]]. The combination of sumptuous ornamentation with rigorously classicizing monumentality, as practiced by Rinaldi, may be attributed to his earlier work under [[Luigi Vanvitelli]] in [[Italy]].

The palace takes its name from its opulent decoration in a wide variety of polychrome [[marble]]s. A rough-grained [[Finland|Finnish]] [[granite]] on the ground floor is in subtle contrast to polished pink [[Karelia]]n marble of the [[pilaster]]s and white [[Urals]] marble of [[Capital (architecture)|capital]]s and [[festoon]]s. Panels of veined bluish gray Urals marble separate the floors, while [[Tallinn]] [[dolomite]] was employed for ornamental [[urn]]s. In all, 32 disparate shades of marble were used to decorate the palace.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saint-petersburg.com/palaces/marble-palace/&lt;/ref&gt;

The plan of the edifice is [[trapezoid]]al: each of its four [[facade]]s, though strictly symmetrical, has a different design. One of the facades conceals a recessed courtyard, where an armored car employed by [[Vladimir Lenin|Lenin]] during the [[October Revolution]] used to be mounted on display between 1937 and 1992. Nowadays, the court is dominated by a sturdy [[equestrian statue]] of [[Alexander III of Russia]], the most famous work of sculptor [[Paolo Troubetzkoy]]; formerly it graced a [[Vosstaniya Square|square before the Moscow Railway Station]].[[File:Spb 06-2012 Palace Embankment various 01.jpg|thumb|left|225px|Embankment façade of the Larger Marble Palace. For a night view see [http://www.encspb.ru/en/bigimage.php?kod=2803987828 here].]]

[[Fedot Shubin]], [[Mikhail Kozlovsky]], [[Stefano Torelli]] and other Russian and foreign craftsmen decorated the interior with inlaid coloured marbles, [[stucco]], and statuary until 1785, by which time Count Orlov had already died (1783), and the Empress had the palace purchased for her own heirs. In 1797&amp;ndash;1798 the structure was leased to [[Stanisław II Augustus]], the last king of [[Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth|Poland]]. Thereafter the palace belonged to Grand Duke [[Constantine Pavlovich]] and his heirs from the Konstantinovichi branch of the [[Romanov]] family.

In 1843, [[Grand Duke Konstantin Nikolayevich of Russia|Grand Duke Constantine Nikolayevich]] decided to redecorate the edifice, renaming it Constantine Palace and engaging [[Alexander Brullov]] as the architect.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saint-petersburg.com/palaces/marble-palace/&lt;/ref&gt; An adjacent church and other outbuildings were completely rebuilt, while the interior of the palace was refurbished in keeping with the [[Eclecticism|eclectic]] tastes of its new owner. Only the main [[staircase]] and the Marble Hall survived that refacing and still retain the refined stucco work and elaborate marble pattern of Rinaldi's original decor. [[File:Marble Palace and Monument to Alexander III.jpg|thumb|170px|Equestrian statue of Alexander III from [[Vosstaniya Square]]]]

==Usage during Soviet times==

During the [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] era, the palace successively housed the Ministry of Labour (1917&amp;ndash;19), the Academy of Material Culture (1919&amp;ndash;36), and, most notably, the main local branch of the Moscow-based Central (i.e. National) [[Lenin]] Museum (1937&amp;ndash;91) with  sub-branches across [[Leningrad]] in Lenin's memorial apartments all over the city - the places where he lived or stayed during his various periods in what was then Saint Petersburg.

==Present state: a branch of Russian Museum==

Currently, the palace accommodates permanent exhibitions of the [[Russian State Museum]],&lt;ref&gt;http://www.saint-petersburg.com/palaces/marble-palace/&lt;/ref&gt; notably "Foreign Artists in Russia (18th and 19th centuries)" and the "[[Peter Ludwig]] Museum at the Russian Museum", featuring canvases by [[Andy Warhol]] and other [[Pop Art]] idols.

'''Maxim Karolik''' (November 21, 1893 – December 20, 1963) was an [[opera singer]] for the Petrograd Grand Opera. He was an [[art collector]] and married into one of [[Boston, Massachusetts]]'s wealthiest families.&lt;ref name=obit/&gt;&lt;ref name=wife/&gt;  

==Biography==
He was born on November 21, 1893 in [[Akkerman|Akkerman, Ukraine]].&lt;ref name=obit/&gt; 

He met [[Martha Codman Karolik|Martha Catharine Codman]] in [[Washington, DC]]. They married on February 2, 1928 in the [[French Riviera]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency= |via= |title=Martha C. Codman Is Married in France To Karolik, Former Petrograd Opera Tenor |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1928/02/16/archives/martha-c-codman-is-married-in-france-to-karolik-former-petrograd.html |quote= |newspaper=[[New York Times]] |date=February 16, 1928 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=wife/&gt;  

He made a hobby of collecting early American [[antique]]s and [[Visual art of the United States|art]]. 

Karolik was guided in his purchases by the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]], Boston, to which he later donated his collection. He was largely responsible for spurring interest in early [[Visual arts of the United States#Nineteenth century|19th-century American art]].  In addition, Karolik purchased, for the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, one well-known American textile, the [[Pictorial Quilt 1898]] stitched by [[Harriet Powers]] (MFA accession no. 64.619).

Karolik recorded ''Russian Art Songs'', thirty songs collected in a three-album set from Unicorn Records in Boston.  A 48-page book that came with the album set included an introductory essay by [[Nicholas Slonimsky]] titled "Russian Music in Art Songs."

He donated his art collection in 1939 to the [[Museum of Fine Arts, Boston|Museum of Fine Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |agency= |via= |title=Boston Museum Gets 18th Century Art.

He traveled from his home in [[Newport, Rhode Island]] to Manhattan for a meeting. He died on December 20, 1963 at [[Trafalgar Hospital]] in [[Manhattan, New York City]].&lt;ref name=obit&gt;{{cite news |agency= |via= |title=Maxim Karolik, Art Patron, Dies.

{{Discrimination sidebar}}

'''Mentalism''' or '''sanism''' is a form of [[discrimination]] and [[oppression]] against a mental trait or condition a person has, or is judged to have. This discrimination may or may not be described in terms of [[mental disorder]] or [[cognitive impairment]]. The discrimination is based on numerous factors such as: [[stereotypes]] about [[Neurodiversity|neurodivergence]] (e.g. [[Autism spectrum|autism spectrum]], [[Learning disability|learning disorders,]] [[ADHD]], [[Bipolar disorder|bipolar]], [[schizophrenia]], [[personality disorders|personality disorder diagnoses]]), specific behavioral phenomena (e.g. [[stuttering]], [[tics]]), or [[intellectual disability]]. 

Like other "isms" such as [[sexism]] and [[racism]], mentalism involves multiple intersecting forms of oppression, complex [[social inequalities]] and imbalances of power. It can result in covert discrimination by multiple, small insults and indignities. It is characterized by judgments of another person's perceived mental health status. These judgments are followed by actions such as blatant, overt discrimination which may include refusal of service, or the denial of human rights. Mentalism impacts how individuals are treated by the [[general public]], by [[mental health professionals]], and by institutions, including the legal system. The negative attitudes involved may also be [[Internalisation (sociology)|internalized]].

The terms mentalism (from [[Mind|mental]]) and sanism (from [[sanity|sane]]) have some widespread use, though concepts such as [[social stigma]], and in some cases [[ableism]], may be used in similar but not identical ways.

While mentalism and sanism are used interchangeably, sanism is becoming predominant in certain circles, such as academics, those who identify as mad and mad advocates and in a socio-political context where sanism is gaining ground as a movement.&lt;ref name=PooleWard2013&gt;{{cite book |last1=Poole |first1=Jennifer M. |last2=Ward |first2=Jennifer |date=2013 |contribution="Breaking open the bone": Storying, Sanism, and Mad Grief |contribution-url=https://books.google.com/books?id=BM2jTziyBtkC&amp;pg=PR7 |title=Mad Matters: A Critical Reader in Canadian Mad Studies |editor1-first=B. |editor1-last=LeFrancois |editor2-first=R. |editor2-last=Menzies |editor3-first=G. |editor3-last=Reaume |location=Toronto |publisher=Canadian Scholars Press }}&lt;/ref&gt; The movement of sanism is an act of resistance among those who identify as mad, consumer survivors, and mental health advocates.&lt;ref name=PooleWard2013/&gt;&lt;ref name=PooleEtAl2012&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Poole |first1=Jennifer M. |last2=Jivraj |first2=Tania |last3=Arslanian |first3=Araxi |last4=Bellows |first4=Kristen |last5=Chiasson |first5=Sheila |last6=Hakimy |first6=Husnia |last7=Pasini |first7=Jessica |last8=Reid |first8=Jenna |date=2012 |url=http://journals.library.mun.ca/ojs/index.php/IJ/article/view/348 |title=Sanism, ‘Mental Health’, and Social Work/Education: A Review and Call to Action |journal=Intersectionalities: A Global Journal of Social Work Analysis, Research, Polity, and Practice |volume=1 }} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Poole2011&gt;Poole, 2011{{Full citation needed|date=August 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; In academia evidence of this movement can be found in the number of recent publications about sanism and social work practice.&lt;ref name=Poole2011/&gt;&lt;ref name=PooleEtAl2012/&gt;&lt;ref name=PooleWard2013/&gt;

==Origin of terms==
[[File:Morton Birnbaum.jpg|alt=|thumb|left|150px|"Sanism" was coined by [[Morton Birnbaum]].]]

The term "[[wikt:sanism|sanism]]" was coined by [[Morton Birnbaum]] during his work representing Edward Stephens, a mental health patient, in a legal case in the 1960s.&lt;ref name="Sane"&gt;{{cite conference |last=Ingram |first=Richard |date=May 2011 |title=Sanism in Theory and Practice |url=http://www.socialinequities.ca/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/Ingram.Sanism-in-Theory-and-Practice.CI_.2011.pdf |format=PDF |conference=Second Annual Critical Inquiries Workshop |conference-url=http://www.socialinequities.ca/2011/07/critical-inquiries-presentations/ |publisher=Centre for the Study of Gender, Social Inequities and Mental Health. [[Simon Fraser University]] |location=Vancouver, Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt; Birnbaum was a physician, lawyer and mental health advocate who helped establish a constitutional right to treatment for psychiatric patients along with safeguards against [[involuntary commitment]]. Since first noticing the term in 1980, New York legal professor [[Michael L. Perlin]] subsequently continued its use.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Perlin |first=Michael L. |date=1993 |title=ADA and Persons with Mental Disabilities: Can Sanist Attitudes Be Undone? |journal=Journal of Law and Health |volume=8 |issue=1 |pages=15–45 |url=http://engagedscholarship.csuohio.edu/jlh/vol8/iss1/4/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Judi Chamberlin 2000 From Privileges to Rights.jpg|alt=|thumb|left|150px|"Mentalism" was coined by [[Judi Chamberlin]].]]
In 1975 [[Judi Chamberlain]] coined the term mentalism in a book chapter of ''Women Look at Psychiatry''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Smith|first1=Dorothy E.|last2=David|first2=Sara J.|title=Women Look at Psychiatry|date=1975|publisher=Press Gang Publishers|location=Vancouver|isbn=0889740003|page=44}}&lt;/ref&gt; The term became more widely known when she used it in 1978 in her book ''On Our Own: Patient Controlled Alternatives to the Mental Health System,'' which for some time became the standard text of the [[psychiatric survivor movement]] in the US.&lt;ref name=Hev&gt;{{cite news|last=Hevesi|first=Denis|title=Judi Chamberlin, 65, Advocate for Mental Health Patients|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2010/01/31/us/31chamberlin.html|accessdate=1 March 2011|newspaper=The New York Times|date=30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Timeline"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://isc.temple.edu/neighbor/ds/disabilityrightstimeline.htm |title=Disability History Timeline |year=2002 |work=Rehabilitation Research &amp; Training Center on Independent Living Management |publisher=[[Temple University]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131220065328/http://isc.temple.edu/neighbor/ds/disabilityrightstimeline.htm |archivedate=20 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Identifying and Overcoming Mentalism|url=http://www.counterpsych.talkspot.com/uploads/23542/uploadedDocuments/Mentalism_07_00.pdf|author=Coni Kalinowski and Pat Risser|date=July 2000|accessdate=2015-12-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Reaume2002"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Reaume |first=Geoffrey |date=July 2002 |title=Lunatic to patient to person: nomenclature in psychiatric history and the influence of patients' activism in North America |journal=International Journal of Law and Psychiatry |volume=25 |issue=4 |pages=405–26 |pmid=12613052 |doi=10.1016/S0160-2527(02)00130-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Weller|first=Penelope|title=New Law and Ethics in Mental Health Advance Directives: The Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities and the Right to Choose|year=2012|publisher=Routledge|isbn=1136159568|page=55|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=PzR2t__ZOeEC&amp;pg=PA55}}&lt;/ref&gt; People began to recognize a pattern in how they were treated, a set of assumptions which most people seemed to hold about mental (ex)patients regardless of whether they applied to any particular individual at any particular time&amp;nbsp;– that they were incompetent, unable to do things for themselves, constantly in need of supervision and assistance, unpredictable, likely to be violent or irrational etc. It was realized that not only did the general public express mentalist ideas, so did ex-patients, a form of internalized [[oppression]].&lt;ref name="Chamberlin"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Chamberlin |first=Judi |date=Summer 1990 |title=The Ex-Patients' Movement: Where We've Been and Where We're Going |journal=The Journal of Mind and Behavior |volume=11 |issue=3 |pages=323–336 |url=http://www.power2u.org/articles/history-project/ex-patients.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;

As of 1998 these terms have been adopted by some consumers/survivors in the [[United Kingdom|UK]] and the USA, but had not gained general currency. This left a conceptual gap filled in part by the concept of '[[Social stigma|stigma]]', but this has been criticized for focusing less on [[institutionalized discrimination]] with multiple causes, but on whether people perceive mental health issues as shameful or worse than they are. Despite its use, a body of literature demonstrated widespread discrimination across many spheres of life, including [[employment]], [[parental rights]], [[Home|housing]], [[immigration]], [[insurance]], [[health care]] and access to [[justice]].&lt;ref&gt;L Sayce (1998) [http://www.ingentaconnect.com/content/apl/cjmh/1998/00000007/00000004/art00002 Stigma, discrimination and social exclusion: What's in a word?] Journal of Mental Health, 7, 4, 331-343&lt;/ref&gt; However, the use of new "isms" has also been questioned on the grounds that they can be perceived as divisive, out of date, or a form of undue [[political correctness]]. The same criticisms, in this view, may not apply so much to broader and more accepted terms like 'discrimination' or '[[social exclusion]]'.&lt;ref&gt;Sayce, L. (2000) [https://books.google.com/books?id=lPQOm76J6QYC&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;source=gbs_ge_summary_r&amp;cad=0#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false From Psychiatric Patient to Citizen: Overcoming Discrimination and Social Exclusion] Macmillan. {{ISBN|0-333-69890-8}} (Pages 16/17).&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also the umbrella term [[ableism]], referring to discrimination against those who are (perceived as) disabled. In terms of the brain, there is the movement for the recognition of [[neurodiversity]]. The term ''psychophobia'' (from [[psyche (psychology)|psyche]] and [[phobia]]) has occasionally been used with a similar meaning.

==Social division==

According to Coni Kalinowski (a [[psychiatrist]] at the University of Nevada and Director of Mojave Community Services&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.medicinenevada.com/find_a_doctor/app-doctors/1/184/ |title=medicinenevada.com |publisher=medicinenevada.com |date= |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;) and Pat Risser (a mental health consultant and self-described former recipient of [[Psychiatric hospital|mental health services]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Published: August 20, 2011 4:01AM |url=http://www.times-gazette.com/local%20news/2011/08/20/off-to-hollywood-local-mental-health-advocate-to-receive-award |title=Off to Hollywood: Local mental health advocate to receive award - Times-Gazette &amp;#124; Ashland &amp; Ashland County, Ohio |publisher=Times-Gazette |date=2011-08-20 |accessdate=2015-12-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;), mentalism at one extreme can lead to a categorical dividing of people into an empowered group assumed to be normal, healthy, reliable, and capable, and a powerless group assumed to be sick, disabled, crazy, unpredictable, and violent. This divide can justify inconsiderate treatment of the latter group and expectations of poorer standards of living for them, for which they may be expected to express [[gratitude]]. Further discrimination may involve labeling some as "high functioning" and some as "low-functioning"; while this may enable the targeting of resources, in both categories human behaviors are recast in [[Pathology|pathological]] terms.&lt;ref name="Kalinowski&amp;Risser"&gt;Coni Kalinowski (psychiatrist) and Pat Risser (former recipient of mental health services) [http://www.newmediaexplorer.org/sepp/Mentalism.pdf Identifying and Overcoming Mentalism] InforMed Health Publishing &amp; Training&lt;/ref&gt;

The discrimination can be so fundamental and unquestioned that it can stop people truly [[Empathy|empathizing]] (although they may think they are) or genuinely seeing the other point of view with respect. Some mental conditions can impair awareness and understanding in certain ways at certain times, but mentalist assumptions may lead others to erroneously believe that they necessarily understand the person's situation and needs better than they do themselves.&lt;ref name="Kalinowski&amp;Risser"/&gt;

Reportedly even within the [[disability rights movement]] internationally, "there is a lot of sanism", and "disability organisations don't always 'get' mental health and don't want to be seen as mentally defective." Conversely, those coming from the mental health side may not view such conditions as disabilities in the same way.&lt;ref&gt;Anglicare Tasmania (2009) [http://www.sswahs.nsw.gov.au/mhealth/content/pdf/Experts_by_Experience.pdf Experts by experience: strengthening the mental health consumer voice in Tasmania] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120415083253/http://www.sswahs.nsw.gov.au/mhealth/content/pdf/Experts_by_Experience.pdf |date=15 April 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some national government-funded charities view the issue as primarily a matter of stigmatizing attitudes within the general public, perhaps due to people not having enough contact with those (diagnosed with) mental illness, and one head of a schizophrenia charity has compared mentalism to the way racism may be more prevalent when people don't spend time together throughout life.&lt;ref&gt;Arlen Kasdorf [http://uniter.ca/view/5661/ Discrimination against mental illness on the rise] June 2011, The Uniter, Vol.16 No.15&lt;/ref&gt; A psychologist who runs [[The Living Museum]] facilitating current or former psychiatric patients to exhibit artwork, has referred to the attitude of the general public as psychophobia.&lt;ref&gt;John Clark [http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jul/12/entertainment/ca-2840 Art Museum of the Mind] Los Angeles Times, 12 July 1998&lt;/ref&gt;

==Clinical terminology==

Mentalism may be enshrined in clinical terminology in subtle ways, including in the basic [[Classification of mental disorders|diagnostic categories]] used by psychiatry (as in the [[Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders|DSM]] or [[International Statistical Classification of Diseases and Related Health Problems|ICD]]). There is some ongoing debate as to which terms and criteria may communicate [[contempt]] or inferiority, rather than facilitate real understanding of people and their issues.

Some oppose the entire process as "[[Labeling theory|labeling]]" and some have responded to justifications for it&amp;nbsp;– for example that it is necessary for clinical or administrative purposes&amp;nbsp;– as the way a person may justify the use of [[ethnic slur]]s because they intend no harm. Others argue that most aspects could easily be expressed in a more accurate and less offensive manner.&lt;ref name="Kalinowski&amp;Risser"/&gt;
[[File:David-william-oaks.jpg|thumb|right|150px|David Oaks, 2009]]
Some clinical terms may be used far beyond the usual narrowly defined meanings, in a way that can obscure the regular human and social context of people's experiences. For example, having a bad time may be assumed to be [[decompensation]]; [[incarceration]] or [[solitary confinement]] may be described as "treatment" regardless of benefit to the person; regular activities like listening to music, engaging in exercise or sporting activities, or being in a particular physical or social environment ([[milieu therapy|milieu]]), may be referred to as "therapy"; all sorts of responses and behaviors may be assumed to be "[[symptom]]s"; core [[adverse effect]]s of drugs may be termed "side" effects.&lt;ref name="Kalinowski&amp;Risser"/&gt;

The former director of a US-based psychiatric survivors organization focused on rights and freedoms, [[David Oaks]], has advocated the taking back of words like "mad", "[[lunatic]]", "crazy" or "bonkers". While acknowledging that some choose not to use such words in any sense, he questions whether medical terms like "mentally ill", "[[psychotic]]" or "clinically depressed" really are more helpful or indicative of seriousness than possible alternatives. Oaks says that for decades he has been exploring the depths of sanism and has not yet found an end, and suggests it may be the most pernicious 'ism' because people tend to define themselves by their rationality and their core feelings.&lt;ref&gt;David Oaks [http://www.mindfreedom.org/kb/mental-health-abuse/psychiatric-labels/not-mentally-ill Let's find language more inclusive than the phrase "mentally ill"!] MindFreedom International. Retrieved 12 December 2011, when stating Last Modified 9/9/11&lt;/ref&gt; One possible response is to critique "normality" and the problems associated with "normal" functioning around the world, although in some ways that could also potentially constitute a form of mentalism. After his 2012 accident breaking his neck and subsequent retirement, Oaks refers to himself as "PsychoQuad" on his personal blog.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.davidwoak.com David Oaks' personal blog]&lt;/ref&gt;

British writer Clare Allen argues that even reclaimed slang terms such as "mad" are just not accurate. In addition, she sees the commonplace mis-use of concepts relating to mental health problems&amp;nbsp;– including for example jokes about people hearing voices as if that automatically undermines their credibility&amp;nbsp;– as equivalent to racist or sexist phrases that would be considered obviously discriminatory. She characterises such usage as indicating an underlying psychophobia and contempt.&lt;ref&gt;Clare Allen [https://www.theguardian.com/society/2007/dec/05/guardiansocietysupplement.mentalhealth Loose-talking psychophobes show nothing but contempt] 5 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Blame==
[[File:Mental health advocacy service graffittied.jpg|thumb|Graffiti on a mental health advocacy service]]
Interpretations of behaviors, and applications of treatments, may be done in an arrogant unjustified way because of an underlying mentalism, according to critics. If a recipient disagrees or does not change, they may be labeled as "non-compliant", "uncooperative", "treatment-resistant". This is despite the fact that the issue may be inadequate understanding of the person or his/her problems, adverse medication effects, a poor match between the treatment and the person's lifestyle, stigma associated with the treatment, difficulty with access, cultural unacceptability, or many other issues.&lt;ref name="Kalinowski&amp;Risser"/&gt;

Mentalism may lead people to assume that someone is not aware of what they are doing and that there is no point trying to communicate with them, despite the fact that they may well have a level of awareness and desire to connect even if they are acting in a seemingly irrational or [[self-harm]]ing way. In addition, [[mental health professionals]] and others may tend to equate subduing a person with treatment; a quiet client who causes no community disturbance may be deemed "improved" no matter how miserable or incapacitated that person may feel as a result.&lt;ref name="Kalinowski&amp;Risser"/&gt;

Clinicians may blame clients for not being sufficiently motivated to work on treatment goals or recovery, and as "[[acting out]]" when things are not agreed with or are found upsetting. But critics say that in the majority of cases this is actually due to the client having been treated in a disrespectful, judgmental, or dismissive manner. Nevertheless, such behavior may be justified by characterizing the client as demanding, angry or "needing limits". To overcome this, it has been suggested that power-sharing should be cultivated and that when respectful [[communication]] breaks down, the first thing that needs to be asked is whether mentalist prejudices have been expressed.&lt;ref name="Kalinowski&amp;Risser"/&gt;

==Neglect==

Mentalism has been linked to [[negligence]] in monitoring for adverse effects of medications (or other interventions), or to viewing such effects as more acceptable than they would be for others. This has been compared to instances of maltreatment based on [[racism]]. Mentalism has also been linked to neglect in failing to check for, or fully respect, people's past experiences of [[abuse]] or other [[Psychological trauma|trauma]].[[File:Recovery Fair 2010.jpg|thumb|150px|T-shirt intended to show the possibility and individuality of recovery]] Treatments that do not support choice and [[self-determination]] may cause people to re-experience the helplessness, pain, despair, and rage that accompanied the trauma, and yet attempts to cope with this may be labeled as "[[acting out]]", "[[Psychological manipulation|manipulating]]", or "[[attention-seeking]]".&lt;ref name="Kalinowski&amp;Risser"/&gt;

In addition, mentalism can lead to "poor" or "guarded" predictions of the future for a person, which could be an overly pessimistic view skewed by a narrow clinical experience. It could also be made impervious to contrary evidence because those who succeed can be discounted as having been [[Misdiagnosis|misdiagnosed]] or as not having the "real" form of a disorder — the [[No true Scotsman]] fallacy. While some mental health problems can involve very substantial disability and can be very difficult to overcome in society, predictions based on prejudice and stereotypes can be self-fulfilling because individuals pick up on a message that they have no real hope,&lt;ref name="Kalinowski&amp;Risser"/&gt; and realistic hope is said to be a key foundation of [[recovery model|recovery]]. At the same time, a trait or condition might be considered more a form of [[individual difference]] that society needs to include and adapt to, in which case a mentalist attitude might be associated with assumptions and prejudices about what constitutes 'normal' society and who is deserving of adaptations, support, or consideration.

==Institutional discrimination==
Offensive and injurious practices may be integrated into clinical procedures, to the point where professionals no longer recognize them as such, in what has been described as a form of [[institutional discrimination]]. [[File:Label for property of dept of mental hygiene.png|thumb|150px|An institutional label]] This may be apparent in physical separation, including separate facilities or accommodation, or in lower standards for some than others. Mental health professionals may find themselves drawn into systems based on bureaucratic and financial imperatives and [[social control]], resulting in alienation from their original values, disappointment in "the system", and adoption of the cynical, mentalist beliefs that may pervade an organization. However, just as employees can be dismissed for disparaging sexual or ethnic remarks, it is argued that staff who are entrenched in negative [[stereotype]]s, attitudes, and beliefs about those labeled with [[mental disorder]]s need to be removed from service organizations.&lt;ref name="Kalinowski&amp;Risser"/&gt; A related theoretical approach, known as [[expressed emotion]], has also focused on negative interpersonal dynamics relating to care givers, especially within families. However, the point is also made in such views that institutional and group environments can be challenging from all sides, and that clear boundaries and rights are required for everyone.

The [[mental health professions]] have themselves been criticised. While [[social work]] (also known as clinical social work) has appeared to have more potential than others to understand and assist those using services, and has talked a lot academically about [[anti-oppressive practice]] intended to support people facing various -isms, it has allegedly failed to address mentalism to any significant degree. The field has been accused, by social work professionals with experience of using services themselves, of failing to help people identify and address what is oppressing them; of unduly deferring to psychiatric or biomedical conventions particularly in regard to those deemed most unwell; and of failing to address its own discriminatory practices, including its conflicts of interest in its official role aiding the social control of patients through [[involuntary commitment]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.olc.edu/local_links/socialwork/OnlineLibrary/Wilson%20%26%20Beresford,%202000,%20Anti-oppressive%20practic,%20emancipation%20or%20appropriation.pdf 'Anti-oppressive practice': emancipation or appropriation?] A Wilson; P Beresford British Journal of Social Work; Oct 2000; 30, 5; Research Library
pg. 553&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[consumer/survivor/ex-patient movement|"user/survivor" movement]] in England, [[Pete Shaughnessy]], a founder of [[mad pride]], concluded that the [[National Health Service]] is "institutionally mentalist and has a lot of soul searching to do in the new Millennium", including addressing the prejudice of its office staff. He suggested that when prejudice is applied by the very professionals who aspire to eradicate it, it raises the question of whether it will ever be eradicated.&lt;ref&gt;Tom Mason, Caroline Carlisle, Caroline Watkins (eds) (2001) [https://books.google.com/books?id=pO0NAAAAQAAJ Stigma and Social Exclusion in Healthcare] Chapter 17: Not in my back yard: Stigma from a personal perspective. Routledge {{ISBN|0-415-22200-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shaughnessy committed [[suicide]] in 2002.&lt;ref&gt;Mark Olden (2003) "Obituary: Pete Shaughnessey" The Guardian, p22, 23 January&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[psychiatric survivors movement]] has been described as a [[feminist]] issue, because the problems it addresses are "important for all women because mentalism acts as a threat to all women" and "mentalism threatens women's families and children."&lt;ref&gt;Wendy Chan, Dorothy E. Chunn, Robert J. Menzies (2005) Women, Madness and the Law: A Feminist Reader Routledge Cavendish, pg257, {{ISBN|1-904385-09-5}} Pg257&lt;/ref&gt; A psychiatric survivor and professional has said that "Mentalism parallels sexism and racism in creating an oppressed underclass, in this case of people who have received psychiatric diagnosis and treatment". She reported that the most frequent complaint of psychiatric patients is that nobody listens, or only selectively in the course of trying to make a diagnosis.&lt;ref&gt;Lindow, V. (1995) "Power and rights: the psychiatric system survivor movement", in Jack, R. Empowerment in Community Care. London: Chapman and Hall. Cited by Kelly, A. Disability and Social Exclusion. University of Canterbury&lt;/ref&gt;

On a society-wide level, mentalism has been linked to people being kept in [[poverty]] as second class citizens; to [[employment discrimination]] keeping people living on handouts; to interpersonal discrimination hindering relationships; to [[stereotypes]] promoted through the media spreading fears of unpredictability and dangerousness; and to people fearing to disclose or talk about their experiences.&lt;ref name="Kalinowski&amp;Risser"/&gt;

==The legal system==
With regard to legal protections against discrimination, mentalism may only be covered under general frameworks such as the [[disability discrimination act]]s that are in force in some countries, and which require a person to say that they have a disability and to prove that they meet the criteria.

In terms of the legal system itself, the law is traditionally based on technical definitions of [[sanity]] and [[insanity]], and so the term 'sanism' may be used in response. The concept is well known in the US legal community, being referred to in nearly 300 law review articles between 1992 and 2013, though is less well known in the medical community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Perlin |first1=Michael L. |date=October 2013 |title=Sanism and the Law |journal=Virtual Mentor |volume=15 |issue=10 |pages=878–885 |publisher=American Medical Association |url=http://virtualmentor.ama-assn.org/2013/10/msoc1-1310.html }}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[File:Michael L. Perlin.jpg|alt=|thumb|200px|Michael L. Perlin, leading proponent of the legal use of the term]] --&gt;

Michael Perlin, Professor of [[Law]] at New York Law School, has defined sanism as "an irrational prejudice of the same quality and character as other irrational prejudices that cause and are reflected in prevailing social attitudes of racism, sexism, homophobia, and ethnic bigotry that permeates all aspects of mental disability law and affects all participants in the mental disability law system: [[litigants]], [[Trier of fact|fact finders]], [[counsel]], and [[Expert witness|expert]] and [[Layperson|lay]] witnesses."&lt;ref name="Perlin09neuro"/&gt;

Perlin notes that sanism affects the theory and practice of law in largely invisible and socially acceptable ways, based mainly on "[[stereotype]], [[myth]], [[superstition]], and [[deindividualization]]." He believes that its "corrosive effects have warped [[involuntary commitment|involuntary civil commitment]] law, institutional law, [[tort law]], and all aspects of the criminal process (pretrial, trial and sentencing)."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Perlin (2008) [https://books.google.com/books/about/Competence_in_the_law.html?id=NSewrw9g8coC Competence in the law: from legal theory to clinical application]&lt;/ref&gt; According to Perlin, judges are far from immune, tending to reflect sanist thinking that has deep roots within our culture. This results in judicial decisions based on stereotypes in all areas of [[Civil law (common law)|civil]] and [[criminal law|criminal]] law, expressed in biased language and showing contempt for [[mental health professionals]]. Moreover, courts are often impatient and attribute mental problems to "weak character or poor resolve".&lt;ref name="Perlin09neuro"/&gt;

Sanist attitudes are prevalent in the teaching of law students, both overtly and covertly, according to Perlin. He notes that this impacts on the skills at the heart of lawyering such as "interviewing, investigating, counseling and negotiating", and on every critical moment of clinical experience: "the initial interview, case preparation, case conferences, planning litigation (or negotiation) strategy, trial preparation, trial and appeal."&lt;ref&gt;Perlin, ML. (2003) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=336121 Sanism in Clinical Teaching] Clinical Law Review, Vol. 9, pp. 683-730&lt;/ref&gt;

There is also widespread discrimination by jurors, who Perlin characterizes as demonstrating "irrational brutality, prejudice, hostility, and hatred" towards defendants where there is an [[insanity defence]]. Specific sanist myths include relying on popular images of craziness; an 'obsession' with claims that mental problems can be easily faked and experts duped; assuming an absolute link between mental illness and dangerousness; an 'incessant' confusion and mixing up of different legal tests of mental status; and assuming that defendants acquitted on insanity defenses are likely to be released quickly. Although there are claims that [[neuroimaging]] has some potential to help in this area, Perlin concludes that it is very difficult to weigh the truth or relevance of such results due to the many uncertainties and limitations, and as it may be either disregarded or over-hyped by scientists, lawyers or in the popular imagination. He believes "the key to an answer here is a consideration of sanism", because to a great extent it can "overwhelm all other evidence and all other issues in this conversation". He suggests that "only [[therapeutic jurisprudence]] has the potential power to 'strip the sanist facade'."&lt;ref name="Perlin09neuro"&gt;Perlin, M. (2009) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=%201336521 'His Brain Has Been Mismanaged with Great Skill': How Will Jurors Respond to Neuroimaging Testimony in Insanity Defense Cases?] Akron Law Review, Vol. 42, No. 2, NYLS Legal Studies Research Paper (free full text)&lt;/ref&gt;

Perlin has suggested that the international [[Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities]] is a revolutionary [[human rights]] document which has the potential to be the best tool to challenge sanist discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;Michael L. Perlin (2013) [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=2283279 'There Must Be Some Way Out of Here': Why the Convention on the Rights of Persons with Disabilities is Potentially the Best Weapon in the Fight Against Sanism] New York Law School, PSYCHIATRY, PSYCHOL. &amp; L. 462 (2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

He has also addressed the topic of sanism as it affects which sexual freedoms or protections are afforded to psychiatric patients, especially in forensic facilities.&lt;ref&gt;Periln, ML (1994) [http://heinonline.org/HOL/LandingPage?handle=hein.journals/nyuls20&amp;div=25&amp;id=&amp;page= Hospitalized Patients and the Right to Sexual Interaction: Beyond the Last Frontier] 20 N.Y.U. Rev. L. &amp; Soc. Change 517 (1992-1994)&lt;/ref&gt;

Sanism in the legal profession can affect many people in communities who at some point in their life struggle with some degree of mental health problems, according to Perlin. This may unjustly limit their ability to legally resolve issues in their communities such as: "contract problems, property problems, domestic relations problems, and trusts and estates problems."&lt;ref&gt;Perlin, ML. [http://papers.ssrn.com/sol3/papers.cfm?abstract_id=345140 Looking at Non-Institutional Mental Disability Law Through the Sanism Filter] NYLS Law Review, Forthcoming&lt;/ref&gt;

Susan Fraser, a lawyer in Canada who specializes in advocating for vulnerable people, argues that sanism is based on fear of the unknown, reinforced by stereotypes that [[dehumanize]] individuals. She argues that this causes the legal system to fail to properly defend patients' rights to refuse potentially harmful medications; to investigate deaths in [[psychiatric hospitals]] and other institutions in an equal way to others; and to fail to properly listen to and respect the voices of mental health consumers and survivors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Fraser |first1=Susan |date=November 2008 |title=Sanism And The Legal Profession: Why Mad People Should Be Angry |url=http://www.lsuc.on.ca/media/eleventh_colloquium_suzan.pdf |conference=Eleventh Colloquium on the Legal Profession: Professionalism and Serving Communities |conference-url=http://www.lsuc.on.ca/with.aspx?id=1197 |publisher=Law Society of Upper Canada }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In education==
Similar issues have been identified by Perlin in how children are dealt with in regard to [[learning disabilities]], including in [[special education]]. In any area of law, he points out, two of the most common sanist myths are presuming that persons with mental disabilities are faking, or that such persons would not be disabled if they only tried harder. In this particular area, he concludes that [[labeling theory|labeled]] children are stereotyped in a process rife with racial, class and gender bias. Although intended to help some children, he contends that in reality it can be not merely a double-edged sword but a triple, quadruple or quintuple edged sword. The end result of sanist prejudices and misconceptions, in the context of academic competition, is that "we are left with a system that is, in many important ways, stunningly incoherent".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Perlin |first=Michael L. |date=Spring 2009 |title=‘Simplify You, Classify You’: Stigma, Stereotypes and Civil Rights in Disability Classification Systems |journal=Georgia State University Law Review |volume=25 |issue=3 |pages=607–639 |url=http://readingroom.law.gsu.edu/gsulr/vol25/iss3/6/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Multiple discriminations==

[[File:The Downward Spiral.jpg|alt=|thumb|200px|A Blend of Downward Spirals]]
A spiral of oppression experienced by some groups in society has been identified. Firstly, oppressions occur on the basis of perceived or actual differences (which may be related to broad group stereotypes such as racism, sexism, [[classism]], [[ageism]], [[homophobia]] etc.). This can have negative physical, social, economic and psychological effects on individuals, including [[Stress (medicine)|emotional distress]] and what might be considered mental health problems. Then, society's response to such distress may be to treat it within a system of medical and social care rather than (also) understanding and challenging the oppressions that gave rise to it, thus reinforcing the problem with further oppressive attitudes and practices, which can lead to more distress, and so on in a vicious cycle. In addition, due to coming into contact with mental health services, people may become subject to the oppression of mentalism, since society (and mental health services themselves) have such negative attitudes towards people with a psychiatric diagnosis, thus further perpetuating oppression and discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first1=Kamaldeep |last1=Bhui |date=25 April 2002 |title=Racism and Mental Health: Prejudice and Suffering |publisher=Jessica Kingsley Publishers |page=77 |isbn=1-84310-076-2 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=WNahbFDhF0kC }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference |last1=Nair |first1=Roshan das |date=30 November 2005 |title=Metaminorities and Mental Health: A model of vulnerability for Black and Minority Ethnic Queer Folk |url=http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/ci/transformations/sexualities/s2/nair%20paper.pdf |format=PDF |conference=2nd Global Conference, Sexualities: Bodies, Desires, Practices |conference-url=http://www.inter-disciplinary.net/critical-issues/gender-and-sexuality/persons-and-sexualities/project-archives/2nd-global-conference-2005/ }}&lt;/ref&gt;

People suffering such oppression within society may be drawn to more radical political action, but sanist structures and attitudes have also been identified in [[activist]] communities. This includes [[cliques]] and [[social hierarchies]] that people with particular issues may find very difficult to break into or be valued by. There may also be individual rejection of people for strange behavior just because it's not considered culturally cool, or alternatively insensitivity to emotional states including suicidality, or denial that someone has issues if they appear "normal".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |date=29 July 2005 |title=A Libertarian Perspective On Depression And Madness |website=The Icarus Project |url=http://theicarusproject.net/articles/a-libertarian-perspective-on-depression-and-madness |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130521090633/http://theicarusproject.net/articles/a-libertarian-perspective-on-depression-and-madness |archive-date=21 May 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9890">'''Metatheatre''', and the closely related term '''metadrama''', describes the aspects of a [[Play (theatre)|play]] that draw attention to its nature as [[drama]] or [[theatre]], or to the circumstances of its performance.

These may include: the direct address of the audience (especially in [[Soliloquy|soliloquies]], [[aside]]s, [[prologue]]s, and [[epilogue]]s); expression of an awareness of the presence of the audience (whether they are addressed directly or not); an acknowledgement of the fact that the people performing are [[actor]]s (and not actually the [[Character (arts)|character]]s they are playing); an element whose meaning depends on the difference between the [[Representation (arts)|represented]] time and place of the drama (the fictional world) and the time and place of its theatrical presentation (the reality of the theatre event); plays-within-plays (or masques, spectacles, or other forms of performance within the drama); [[Metareference|references]] to [[acting]], theatre, dramatic writing, [[Audience|spectatorship]], and the frequently employed [[metaphor]] according to which "[[all the world's a stage]]" (''Theatrum mundi''); scenes involving [[eavesdropping]] or other situations in which one or several characters observe another or others, such that the former relate to the behaviour of the latter as if it were a staged performance for their benefit.

The words "metatheatre" and "metadrama" combine [[theatre]] or [[drama]] with the Greek prefix "meta—", which implies "a level beyond" the subject that it qualifies.

Metatheatre has in modern times involved into the term "meta acting", usually in reference to movies, whereas the character gives an indication that he realizes he is in a movie, also called "breaking the fourth wall."

==In the history of drama==

===Greece and Rome===
Metatheatricality has been a dimension of drama ever since its invention in the [[Theatre of ancient Greece|theatre of]] [[classical Greece]] 2,500 years ago. One major purpose of this metatheatricality was to keep then spectators away from utter involvement or belief in the development of the plot presented.  [[Ancient Greek comedy]] in particular made frequent use of it (though examples can also be found in [[tragedy]]).

===Early modern theatre===
In [[English Renaissance theatre|early modern English theatre]], characters often adopt a downstage position in close contact with the audience and comment on the actions of others sarcastically or critically, while the other actors assume the convention that the first remains unheard and unseen while so doing. Following the work of Robert Weimann and others, [[theatre studies]] uses the terms ''locus'' and ''platea'' (relating to "location" and "place", borrowed from [[medieval theatre]]) to describe this performance effect—the ''locus'' is localised within the drama such that its characters are absorbed in its fiction and unaware of the presence of the audience; while the ''platea'' is a neutral space in close contact with the spectators that exists on the boundary between the fiction and the audience's reality.

When the defeated [[Cleopatra]], performed by a [[boy player]] in act five of Shakespeare's ''[[Antony and Cleopatra]]'', fears her humiliation in the theatres of Rome in plays staged to ridicule her, she says: "And I shall see some squeaking Cleopatra boy my greatness in the posture of a whore". While the actor is not necessarily engaged at this point in the direct address of the audience, the reality of the male performer beneath the female character is openly, and comically, acknowledged (qualifying in important ways, supported further in the scene and the play as a whole, the tragic act of her imminent suicide). Metatheatricality of this kind is found in most plays of that period.

In ''Hamlet'', there occurs the following exchange between [[Prince Hamlet|Hamlet]] and [[Polonius]]:
{{poemquote
|text=Hamlet: ... ''My lord, you played once i'th'university, you say.''
Polonius: ''That I did my lord, and was accounted a good actor.''
Hamlet: ''And what did you enact?''
Polonius: ''I did enact [[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]. I was killed i'th'Capitol. [[Brutus]] killed me.''
Hamlet: ''It was a brute part of him to kill so capital a calf there.''
|title=''[[Hamlet]]'' (3.2.95–100).}}
If the only significance of this exchange lay in its reference to characters within another play, it might be called a [[metadrama]]tic (or "[[Intertextuality|intertextual]]") moment. Within its original performance context, however, there is a more specific, metatheatrical reference. Historians assume that Hamlet and Polonius were played by the same actors who had played the roles mentioned in Shakespeare's ''[[Julius Caesar (play)|Julius Caesar]]'' a year or two earlier on the same stage.&lt;ref&gt;Edwards (1985, 5).&lt;/ref&gt; Apart from the dramatic linking of the character of Hamlet with the murderer Brutus (foreshadowing Hamlet's murder of Polonius later in the play), the audience's awareness of the identities of the actors and their previous roles is comically referenced.

===Modern theatre===

====The fourth wall====
In the modern era, the rise of [[Realism (theatre)|realism]] and [[Naturalism (theatre)|naturalism]] led to the development of a performance [[Dramatic convention|convention]] known as the "[[fourth wall]]". The metaphor suggests a relationship to the [[mise-en-scène]] behind a [[proscenium]] arch. When a scene is set indoors and three of the walls of its room are presented onstage, the "fourth" of them would run along the line dividing the room from the auditorium (technically called the "proscenium"). The fourth wall is thus an invisible, imagined wall that separates the actors from the audience. While the audience can see through this "wall", the convention assumes, the actors act as if they cannot. In this sense, the "fourth wall" is a convention of [[acting]], rather than of [[set design]]. It can be created regardless of the presence of any actual walls in the set, or the physical arrangement of the [[Theater (building)|theatre building]] or performance space, or the actors' distance from or proximity to the audience.

"Breaking the fourth wall" is any instance in which this performance convention, having been adopted more generally in the drama, is disregarded. The temporary suspension of the convention in this way draws attention to its use in the rest of the performance. This act of drawing attention to a play's performance conventions is metatheatrical.

A similar effect of metareference is achieved when the performance convention of avoiding direct contact with the camera, generally used by actors in a television drama or film, is temporarily suspended. The phrase "breaking the fourth wall" is used to describe such effects in those media.

====Modernism====
Instances of metatheatricality ''other'' than "breaking the fourth wall" occur in plays by many of the realist playwrights, including [[Henrik Ibsen]], [[August Strindberg]], and [[Anton Chekhov]]. As with [[modernism]] more generally, metareference in the form of metatheatricality comes to play a far more central and significant role in the modernist theatre, particularly in the work of [[Bertolt Brecht]], [[Vsevolod Meyerhold]], [[Luigi Pirandello]], [[Thornton Wilder]], [[Samuel Beckett]], and many others.

In more recent times, ''[[With the People from the Bridge]]'' by [[Dimitris Lyacos]] employs metatheatrical techniques whereby a makeshift play centered on the vampire legend is viewed from the angle of a spectator who records in his diary the setting and preparations as well as the sequence of the actors' soliloquies interspersed with personal notes on the development of the performance.

==Origin of the term==
The term "metatheatre" was coined by [[Lionel Abel]] in 1963 and has since entered common critical usage. Abel described metatheatre as reflecting comedy and tragedy, at the same time, where the audience can laugh at the protagonist while feeling empathetic simultaneously.&lt;ref&gt;Abel 2003, p. 172.&lt;/ref&gt; Abel relates it to the character of [[Alonso Quijano|Don Quixote]], whom he considers to be the prototypical, metatheatrical, self-referring character. Don Quixote looks for situations of which he wants to be a part, not waiting for life to oblige, but replacing reality with imagination when the world is lacking in his desires.&lt;ref&gt;Abel 2003, p. 139&lt;/ref&gt; The character is aware of his own theatricality.

The '''National Herbarium''' is an [[herbarium]], located in [[Islamabad]], [[Pakistan]].

==History and collection==
The largest herbarium in Pakistan, it was established in 1975 with Dr. [[Ralph Randles Stewart]]'s collection as its initial beginning. It has a collection of over 100,000 plants. The plants in the herbarium are divided into [[magnoliophyte]]s ([[dicotyledon]]s and [[monocotyledon]]s), [[gymnosperm]]s and [[Pteridophyta|pteridophytes]] (or ferns) and they are placed according to families, genera; and species arranged in alphabetical order.

'''''Needle Tower''''' is a public artwork by [[United States|American]] sculptor [[Kenneth Snelson]]  located outside of the [[Hirshhorn Museum and Sculpture Garden]] in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[United States]].&lt;ref name="SOS"&gt;{{cite web | author=Hirshhorn Museum | author2=Sculpture Garden | last-author-amp=yes | date=2008 | title=Needle Tower, (sculpture). | work=Inventories of American Painting and Sculpture

==Description==

This very tall abstract sculpture is a tapering tower made of [[aluminum]] and [[stainless steel]].&lt;ref name="SOS"/&gt; The aluminum tubes act in compression, held in tension by the stainless steel cables threaded through in the ends of the tubes.&lt;ref&gt;''A Garden for Art'', Valerie J. Fletcher, LOC # 97-61991, p.85&lt;/ref&gt;

==Acquisition==

The piece was a gift of [[Joseph Hirshhorn]] in 1974.&lt;ref name="SOS"/&gt;

==Tensegrity==

Snelson's unique sculpture style is well articulated in ''Needle Tower''. 
The structure style displayed is known as "[[tensegrity]]," a description given by Snelson's former professor [[Buckminster Fuller]] to the melding of [[tension (mechanics)|tension]] and [[structural integrity]]. According to Snelson: &lt;blockquote&gt;Tensegrity describes a closed structural system composed of a set of three or more elongate compression struts within a network of tension tendons, the combined parts mutually supportive in such a way that the struts do not touch one another, but press outwardly against nodal points in the tension network to form a firm, triangulated, prestressed, tension and compression unit.&lt;ref name="Snelson"&gt;{{cite web | author=Kenneth Snelson | date= | title=FAQ | work=

==Symbolism==

[[File:Kenneth Snelson Needle Tower.JPG|right|thumbnail|The six-pointed star visible from under ''Needle Tower'']]
Much has been said about the geometric shapes seen in Snelson's works. Looking up from the inside of ''Needle Tower'' one may see the [[Star of David]]. According to Snelson, his works are not symbolic and it's common to see six-pointed stars in his work. In ''Needle Tower'' the six pointedness comes from the natural geometry of the three compression struts that make up each layer. Sets of three alternate with left and right [[Helix|helical]] modules, adding up to six when viewed upwards from the base of the tower.&lt;ref name="Snelson"/&gt;

==Conservation==

In April 2010 conservation work was completed on the sculpture by the Hirshhorn Museum. It took 15 staff members to stand the tower upright after conservation completion.&lt;ref name="Conservation"&gt;{{cite web | author=Hirshhorn Museum | author2=Sculpture Gardens | last-author-amp=yes | date=2010 | title=Installation of Kenneth Snelson's "Needle Tower"| work=

==''Needle Tower II''==

A second ''Needle Tower'', ''Needle Tower II'', was completed in 1968 and was acquired by the [[Kröller-Müller Museum]] in 1971. The piece resides in the museum's sculpture garden.&lt;ref name=BurlingtonMag&gt;''Acquisitions of Modern Art by Museums: Supplement''.

'''Ngai''' ('''Engai''', '''Enkai''', '''Mweai''', '''Mwiai''') is the monolithic [[Supreme Being|Supreme God]] in the spirituality of the [[Kamba people|Kamba]] and [[Kikuyu people|Kikuyu]] of [[Kenya]]. Ngai is creator of the universe and all in it. The Kikuyu worshiped Ngai facing the  Mt. Kirinyaga ([[Mount Kenya]]) while prayers and goat sacrificial rituals were performed under the sacred Mugumo tree (a fig tree species). Ngai often was referred to as "Mwene Nyaga" meaning (the Owner of the mountain). 

According to Kikuyu [creation myth]],  Ngai created [[Human|humanity]], first man called Gikuyu and first woman called Mumbi. Ngai created a mountain "As his resting place when on inspection tour and a as sign of his wonders."&lt;ref name="Kenyatta"&gt;{{cite book |title=Facing Mt.

The '''''Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary''''' ('''''OALD''''') was the first [[advanced learner's dictionary]] of English. It was first published in 1948. It is the largest English-language dictionary from [[Oxford University Press]] aimed at a non-native audience. Users with a more linguistic interest, requiring etymologies or copious references, usually prefer the ''[[Concise Oxford English Dictionary]]'', or indeed the comprehensive ''[[Oxford English Dictionary]]'', or other dictionaries aimed at speakers of English with native-level competence.

==History==
The ''Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary'', previously entitled the ''Oxford Advanced Learner's Dictionary of Current English'', started life as the ''Idiomatic and Syntactic Dictionary'', edited by [[A. S. Hornby|Albert Sydney Hornby]]. It was first published in [[Japan]] in 1942. It then made a perilous wartime journey to Britain where it came under the wing of OUP, which decided it would be the perfect counterpart for the prestigious OED.

A. S. Hornby was a teacher of [[English studies]] at a small college in Japan; he had gone there in 1923 to teach literature, but his experiences in the classroom drew his attention to the need for sound principles of [[language education|language teaching]]. At that time [[Harold E. Palmer]] headed the Institute for Research into English Teaching in [[Tokyo]], and in 1931 he invited Hornby to work on vocabulary development at the Institute. The result of this was the ''Idiomatic and Syntactic Dictionary'', published by Kaitakusha in 1942. A year before publication, Hornby had managed to send an [[advance copy]] in sheets of the book to B. Ifor Evans at the [[British Council]], a tough feat during the war. Ifor Evans offered him a job, and in 1942 Hornby came back to Britain and joined the Council, which posted him to [[Iran]].

The sheets reached [[Humphrey S. Milford]], then publisher to the [[University of Oxford]] and effectively OUP's [[managing director]]. Milford saw immediately that the dictionary could fill a troublesome gap in the Press's lists, since it was compiled for non-English speakers and rested on Hornby's solid experience in teaching the language overseas. Thus it explained [[spelling]], [[grammar]], [[phonetics]], and usage much more extensively than would a dictionary for native English speakers. With the cachet of the Press to promote it, it could take the "Oxford dictionary" brand to readerships that might be intimidated or puzzled by the more magisterial OED.

But the [[command economy]] of [[World War II]] under which all British [[publishing|publishers]] were then operating posed a problem: everything was in short supply, and Milford appealed to the British Council for help in getting the paper and cloth.&lt;ref name="Great Clarendon Street 1941"&gt;OUP Archives held at the OUP headquarters, Great Clarendon Street, Oxford, UK, Milford's Letterbooks Vol. 165 fol. 493, Milford to Ifor Evans, 4 July 1941.&lt;/ref&gt;  He referred the matter to E.C. Parnwell, who was looking after the Press's overseas projects, Milford being by then too unwell to manage the Press without substantial assistance, as he had been doing since 1904.&lt;ref name="Great Clarendon Street 1941"/&gt;

Hornby had brought with him the world rights to the book excluding Japan and China; Kenneth Sisam, then Secretary to the Delegates of the Press, gave a favourable report to the Delegates on the book. Milford also cleverly used the current state of hostility with Japan to push for a subsidy from the British Council, although all he actually said was that "the Japanese are very cheap producers" and were likely to capture the market.

The book had more than 1,500 pages and for an edition of 10,000 copies would need ten tons of paper. Milford applied for a special release to acquire this paper "in the direct interest of [[British culture]] and overseas trade, particularly in the non-[[Pound sterling|sterling]] areas". He had adequate paper stock to begin the edition but this was all earmarked for "essential reprints" and he could only use it if replacements were guaranteed.&lt;ref&gt;OUP Archives, Milford's Letterbooks, Vol. 165 fol. 632B, Milford to Ifor Evans, 8 August; fol. 757, 19 September 1941&lt;/ref&gt;  Milford's niece, Eleanor M. Booker, was now working at the [[India Office]], and he lobbied for paper through her.

Finally the book came out between 1943 and 1948 and became an instant success. Today it is one of the most used resources by learners of the English language worldwide.

The book is useful for all competitive exams.

==Student's Dictionary==
In contrast to the Oxford's learner dictionaries, which are designed for learning foreign languages (English in the case of OALD), Oxford Student's Dictionary is designed for learners using English to study other subjects.&lt;ref&gt;[https://elt.oup.com/catalogue/items/global/dictionaries/oxford_students_dictionary_english_to_study_other_subjects/?cc=ca&amp;selLanguage=en]&lt;/ref&gt; Oxford Student's Dictionary has smaller vocabulary than the OALD counterpart.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1998">In [[Ovid]]'s ''[[Metamorphoses]]'', '''Phantasos''' ('Fancy') is one of the thousand sons of [[Somnus]] (Sleep). He appeared in dreams in the form of inanimate objects, putting on "deceptive shapes of earth, rocks, water, trees, all lifeless things".&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p. 249; Tripp, s.v. Somnus, p. 534; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.165.xml 11.641&amp;ndash;643].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Ovid, two of his brothers were [[Morpheus]], who appeared in dreams in human form, and one called Icelos ('Like'), by the gods, but [[Phobetor]] ('Frightener') by men, who appeared in dreams in the form of inanimate objects.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p. 249; [[Ovid]], ''[[Metamorphoses]]'' [https://www.loebclassics.com/view/ovid-metamorphoses/1916/pb_LCL043.165.xml 11.638&amp;ndash;641].&lt;/ref&gt; The three brothers names are found nowhere earlier than Ovid, and are perhaps Ovidian inventions.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, p. 249.&lt;/ref&gt; Tripp calls these three figures "literary, not mythical concepts".&lt;ref&gt;Tripp, s.v. Somnus, p. 534.&lt;/ref&gt; However Griffin suggests that this division of dream forms between Phantasos and his brothers, possibly including their names, may have been of Hellenistic origin.&lt;ref&gt;Griffin, pp. 179, 249.&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Safety statement''' is the name given to the document that outlines how a company manages their health and safety in the [[Republic of Ireland]], based upon the Safety, Health and Welfare at Work Act, 2005. The requirement to have a written safety statement is outlined in Section 20 of the above Act, although it was also a requirement in the original (but now revoked) Act of 1989. The document is primarily based on the risk assessment of workplace hazards.

==Summary==
The safety statement document details how the organisation identifies, assesses and controls risks in the [[workplace]] and what arrangements are in place to achieve this. It is a legal requirement for all employers, regardless of the number of employees. The exceptions are if there are three or fewer employed by a company or self-employed person and the sector or work activity carried out is covered under a Code of Practice prepared by the [[Health and Safety Authority]], then that is considered to be sufficient (although in this case, there is still a requirement to carry out risk assessments for the work activity).

==Background==
It is a legal requirement in nearly all countries for [[employer]]s to ensure the [[health and safety]] of [[employee]]s and others who may be affected by an organisations work activities (such as members of the public, [[Independent contractor|contractors]], site visitors or guests etc.). This requirement is normally explicitly stated in the [[Health and safety law|health and safety legislation]] that applies to each country. There are usually a number of basic criteria that need to be met by employers in order to achieve this goal (such as adequate [[training]], suitable instruction and supervision, the provision of information, provision of [[Emergency response planning|emergency response plans]] and the [[Risk assessment|assessment of risk]] amongst others). In addition, there is normally a requirement for an organisation to document in writing how it will ensure that it meets the minimum legal health and safety requirements.

[[Image:Scota &amp; Gaedel Glas.jpg|thumb|right|300px|The founders of Scotland of medieval legend, [[Scota]] with [[Goídel Glas]], voyaging from [[Egypt]], as depicted in a 15th-century manuscript of the ''Scotichronicon'']] 
The '''''Scotichronicon''''' is a 15th-century [[chronicle]] or legendary account, by the [[Scotland|Scottish]] historian [[Walter Bower]]. It is a continuation of historian-priest [[John of Fordun]]'s earlier work ''[[Chronica Gentis Scotorum]]'' beginning with the founding of [[Ireland]] and thereby [[Scotland]] by [[Scota]] with [[Goídel Glas]]. Queen Scota's name means "blossom" in Irish &amp; Scottish Gaelic. Scotti was once a synonym for Irish, indicating that they (Irish &amp; Scots) are "people of the blossom," or descendants of Queen Scota. 

==Importance==
The [[National Library of Scotland]] has called it "probably the most important medieval account of early Scottish history", noting that it provides both a strong expression of national identity and a window into the world view of medieval commentators.&lt;ref name="nls"&gt;{{cite web  | title = 1454 - Scotichronicon  | publisher = [[National Library of Scotland]]  | url = http://www.nls.uk/scotlandspages/timeline/1454.html  | accessdate = 2008-01-05  | deadurl = yes  | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20071020215817/http://www.nls.uk/scotlandspages/timeline/1454.html  | archivedate = 2007-10-20  | df =   }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The text includes a reference to "the famous murderer, Robin Hood, as well as Little John", one of the earliest records of [[Robin Hood]] and [[Little John]]. The reference is found, in Latin, under year 1266.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.shakespearesengland.com/2010/04/real-robin-hood.html|title=The real Robin Hood|author=Shakespeare's England|accessdate=2012-06-26|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522160357/http://www.shakespearesengland.com/2010/04/real-robin-hood.html|archivedate=2012-05-22|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The work==
Bower began the work in 1440 at the request of a neighbour, Sir [[David Stewart of Rosyth]]. The completed work, in its original form, consists of 16 books, of which the first five and a portion of the sixth (to 1163) are Fordun's—or mainly his, for Bower added to them at places. In the later books, down to the reign of [[Robert I of Scotland|Robert I]] (1371), he was aided by Fordun's ''[[Gesta Annalia]]'', but from that point to the close, the work is original and of contemporary importance, especially for [[James I of Scotland|James I]], with whose death it ends. The task was finished in 1447.

==Criticism==
Bower has been described as a less competent chronicler than Fordun, with one commenter calling him "garrulous, irrelevant and inaccurate" and noting that he "makes every important occurrence an excuse for a long-winded moral discourse".&lt;ref name="camb"&gt;{{cite book  | last = Ward  | first = A.W.  |author2=A. R. Waller   | title = The Cambridge History of English and American Literature  | publisher = New York: Bartleby.com  | date = 2000  | volume = 2 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Abridgments==
Bower engaged in a reduction or "[[abridgment]]" of the ''Scotichronicon'' in the last two years of his life, which is known as the ''Book of Cupar'', and which is preserved in the [[Advocates' library]], [[Edinburgh]] (MS. 35. 1. 7). Other abridgments, not by Bower, were made about the same time, one about 1450 (perhaps by Patrick Russell, a [[Carthusian]] of [[Perth, Scotland|Perth]]) preserved in the Advocates' library (MS. 35. 6. 7) and another in 1461 by an unknown writer, also preserved in the same collection (MS. 35. 5. 2). Copies of the full text of the ''Scotichronicon'', by different [[scribes]], are extant. There are two in the [[British Library]], in [[The Black Book of Paisley]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bl.uk/onlinegallery/onlineex/illmanus/roymanucoll/c/011roy000013e10u00014000.html|title=Colophon And A List Of Scottish Monasteries, In The 'Black Book of Paisley'|publisher=British Library|accessdate=15 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; and in [[Harleian Collection|Harl. MS.]] 712; one in the Advocates' library, from which [[Walter Goodall]] printed his edition (Edinburgh, 1759), and one in the library of [[Corpus Christi College, Cambridge]].

In the [[Domain Name System]] (DNS) hierarchy, a '''second-level domain''' ('''SLD''' or '''2LD''') is a domain that is directly below a [[top-level domain]] (TLD). For example, in &lt;tt&gt;example.com&lt;/tt&gt;, &lt;tt&gt;example&lt;/tt&gt; is the second-level domain of the &lt;tt&gt;.com&lt;/tt&gt; TLD.

Second-level domains commonly refer to the organization that registered the domain name with a [[domain name registrar]]. Some [[domain name registry|domain name registries]] introduce a second-level hierarchy to a TLD that indicates the type of entity intended to register an SLD under it. For example, in the [[.uk]] namespace a college or other academic institution would register under the &lt;tt&gt;.ac.uk&lt;/tt&gt; [[ccSLD]], while companies would register under &lt;tt&gt;.co.uk&lt;/tt&gt;.

== Historic second-level domains ==
There are several second-level domains which are no longer available.

=== Australia ===
Second-level domains under .au which are no longer available include: ''.conf.au'' originally intended for conferences; ''.gw.au'' for the Australian Academic and Research networks; ''info.au'' for general information, ''.otc.au'' and ''.telememo.au'' for the X.400 mail systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=the australian second level domain name system|url=http://www.bladesplace.id.au/australian-domains.html|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Canada ===
Prior to 12 Oct 2010 there were second level domain based on province:
.ab.ca — Alberta, .bc.ca — British Columbia, .mb.ca — Manitoba, .nb.ca — New Brunswick, .nf.ca — Newfoundland, .nl.ca — Newfoundland and Labrador, .ns.ca — Nova Scotia, .nt.ca — Northwest Territories, .nu.ca — Nunavut, .on.ca — Ontario, .pe.ca — Prince Edward Island, .qc.ca — Quebec, .sk.ca — Saskatchewan, .yk.ca — Yukon {{citation needed|reason=the specificity of the claim seems like this was an announced policy, but it doesn't appear that way.|date=February 2016}}

Since 2010, some have been replaced (for example, alberta.ca) while others have remained under the provincial two letter SLD (e.g., transport Ontario www.mto.gov.on.ca) while others have been moved to more traditional subdomains (www.transportation.alberta.ca).&lt;ref&gt;https://cira.ca/sites/default/files/public/policy/general_registration_rules_version_3.21_february_5_2015.pdf |accessdate=18 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt;

=== France ===
Historic second-level domains for France included:
''.tm.fr'' (for brands), .''com.fr'' (for commercial use) and ''.asso.fr.'' &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Useful information about .fr domains|url=http://www.easyname.com/en/fr-domain|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ICANN-Registrar: French Domains with Accents|url=http://www.domainregistry.de/fr-domain.html|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The Netherlands ===
Historic second-level domains for The Netherlands included:
.''co.nl'' (for commercial use)
&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commercial, national &amp; international character with a .co.nl domain name|url=http://domain.co.nl/en|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=.Co.NL WhoIS|url=https://whois.co.nl|accessdate=25 January 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Yugoslavia ===
In 2006 the .yu ccTLD was replaced by rs (for Serbia) and .me (for Montenegro).
Second-level domains under .yu included:
.ac.yu – for academic institutions, ''.co.yu'' for commercial enterprises; ''.org.yu'' for organizations and ''.cg.yu'' for residents of Montenegro.
Only legal entities were allowed to register names under .yu and its second-level domains.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=.RS - Republic of Serbia .ME - Republic of Montenegro (Former parts of Yugoslavia) Formerly .YU and .CS Country Codes.|url=http://tldv.com/Dot-yu-Yugoslavia.htm|accessdate=31 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Tuvalu ===
Historic second-level domains for Tuvalu included:
[http://co.tv/ co.tv]

== Legal issues ==
As a result of ICANN's generic top-level domain (gTLD) expansion,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Delegated strings|url=http://newgtlds.icann.org/en/program-status/delegated-strings|accessdate=29 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; the risk of [[Cybersquatting|domain squatting]] has increased significantly. For example, based on current regulations, the registration of the gTLDs .olympics or .redcross is not allowed, however the registration of sites such as olympics.example or redcross.example is not controlled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Easton|first1=Catherine R.|title=ICANN’s core principles and the expansion of generic top-level domain names.|journal=International Journal of Law and Information Technology|date=2012|volume=20|issue=4|pages=273/290|url=http://ijlit.oxfordjournals.org/content/20/4/273.full|accessdate=29 October 2014|doi=10.1093/ijlit/eas013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Experts say that further restrictions are needed for second-level domains under the new gTLD .health, as well. For example, second-level domains under ''.tobacco.health'' or ''.diet.health'' can be easily misused by companies and therefore are a potential threat to Internet users.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Mackey|first1=TK|last2=Liang|first2=BA|last3=Kohler|first3=JC|last4=Attaran|first4=A|title=Health Domains for Sale: The Need for Global Health Internet Governance|journal=J Med Internet Res|date=5 March 2014|volume=16|issue=3|doi=10.2196/jmir.3276|pmid=24598602|url=http://www.jmir.org/2014/3/e62/|accessdate=2014-10-29|pmc=3961808|page=e62}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Smithsonian Institution Office of Protection Services''' is the [[Security guard|guard]] force of the [[Smithsonian Institution]].

It is a federal guard force consisting of 850 officers with very limited [[special police]] authority tasked with protecting visitors, staff, property, and grounds of the [[Federal government of the United States|federally]] owned and managed Smithsonian Institution [[museum]]s and research centers in [[Washington, D.C.]], [[New York City]], at the 2,800 acre [[Smithsonian Environmental Research Center]] in [[Maryland]] as well as oversight of the security operations at the [[Smithsonian Tropical Research Institute]] in Panama.

== History ==
According to a 1978 report by the [[Comptroller General of the United States]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;In 1882 the Office of Public Buildings and Grounds was authorized to employ four watchmen to protect the buildings and grounds of the Smithsonian. The powers and duties of the watchmen were the same as those of the District's Metropolitan Police. Pursuant to 40 U.S.C. 193n, the Smithsonian was authorized to employ special policemen to police the buildings and grounds of the Institution. The special police were authorized to concurrently enforce, with the United States Park Police, the laws and regulations of the National Capital Parks.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Law Enforcement Authority==
According to the U.S Code ([[Title 40 of the United States Code|Title 40]], Chapter 63, §6306), Smithsonian guards and National Zoo police officers are designated as [[Special police#United States|special police]].  Subsection B outlines the powers of these special officers stating that they:

{{quote|(1) may, within the specified buildings and grounds, enforce, and make arrests for violations of, sections 6302 and 6303 of this title, any regulation prescribed under section 6304 of this title, federal or state law, or any regulation prescribed under federal or state law; and

(2) may enforce concurrently with the [[United States Park Police]] the laws and regulations applicable to the National Capital Parks, and may make arrests for violations of sections 6302 and 6303 of this title, within the several areas located within the exterior boundaries of the face of the curb lines of the squares within which the specified buildings and grounds are located."&lt;ref name="section6306"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/40C63.txt |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2010-07-13 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100710022726/http://uscode.house.gov/download/pls/40C63.txt |archivedate=2010-07-10 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a uniformed force in accordance with subsection C, employees designated as special police for the Smithsonian "may be provided, without charge, with [[uniform]]s and other equipment as may be necessary for the proper performance of their duties, including badges, [[revolver]]s, and [[ammunition]]."&lt;ref name="section6306"/&gt;

The National Zoological Park Police being as a Federal Law Enforcement Agency that represents one of the five original full service police forces in the Washington District of Columbia share full police powers within the District of Columbia, in addition has a Congressional mandate in the form of a cooperative agreement with the [[Metropolitan Police Department of the District of Columbia]] to assist with law enforcement and crime prevention in a directed patrol areas in the Second, Third and Fourth Police Service areas around the National Zoological Park.&lt;ref&gt;http://mpdc.dc.gov/mpdc/cwp/view,a,1242,q,547179,mpdcNav_GID,1541.asp&lt;/ref&gt;

==Positions==

There are several position levels within the Office of Protection Services:
*'''Smithsonian Museum protection officers''' are security officers that have been designated as "special police" under the [[United States Code|US Code]] ([[Title 40 of the United States Code|Title 40]], Chapter 63, §6306) and have limited police powers. They undergo training (that is limited and does not meet the standards of established police academies) in CPR, [[firearm]] use, [[arrest]], [[Handcuffs|handcuff]] procedures, and [[pepper spray]] use. They are assigned to one of nineteen Smithsonian museums or research sites in [[New York City]], Maryland, [[Virginia]], or the [[District of Columbia]]. There is also a specialized K-9 unit with bomb-detection dogs that patrol museum grounds. Officers utilize patrol vehicles for most sites in D.C. as well as ATV and Boats for the facility in Maryland.
*'''Smithsonian Museum physical security specialists''' and '''Supervisory physical security specialists''' assist in overseeing the protection operations at individual sites.
[[Image:United States National Zoological Park Police.jpg|thumb|left|125px|&lt;center&gt;National Zoological Park Police patch]]
*'''US National Zoological Park Police officers''' are specifically assigned to the [[National Zoological Park (United States)|National Zoo]] and the [[Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute]] in Front Royal, Virginia. The National Zoological Park Police is one of the oldest police forces in the District of Columbia. According to the official National Zoo Website, the Zoological Police was one of the original five police agencies in D.C. created in 1889. The {{convert|163|acre|km2|adj=on}} National Zoo is a Smithsonian facility in the District of Columbia and is staffed 24 hours a day by full-time US National Zoological Park police officers. The National Zoo also maintains a 3200-acre Research facility (Smithsonian Conservation Biology Institute; SCBI) in Front Royal, Virginia; which is staffed by members of the National Zoological Park Police.  NZPP officers are Federal law enforcement officers and carry full law enforcement jurisdiction within the District of Columbia and Virginia that work closely with the Metropolitan Police Department and the US Park Police, as well as other federal law enforcement agencies to include Virginia Law Enforcement Authorities.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nbcwashington.com/news/local-beat/Zoo-Police-Security-Director-Spar-Over-Safety-Needs.html "Zoo Police, Security Director Spar Over Safety Needs"], NBC 4, Kimberly Suiters/ASHA BEH, Apr. 28, 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

==Law Enforcement Union membership==
Smithsonian Museum officers in New York state are members of the [[Fraternal Order of Police]] Lodge #38 while officers in the District of Columbia belong to the [[American Federation of Government Employees]] (AFGE) Local 2463. The Fraternal Order of Police is a national labor union of law enforcement officers and agents.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2442">The '''Swedish National Archive of Recorded Sound and Moving Images''', in Swedish ''Statens ljud- och bildarkiv'', SLBA, was founded in 1979 (originally having the name ''Arkivet för ljud och bild,'' ALB) with the aim of collecting and preserving all film and recorded sound produced in [[Sweden]], including radio and television programs. The archive was an independent institution under the Ministry of Education, Research and Culture (utbildnings - och kulturdepartementet). It was located in [[Stockholm]] and employed 65 people. The last director general was Sven Allerstrand.

A national deposit law requires publishers to submit a copy of all new titles to the archive. The older collections are gradually built from donations and acquisitions, but suffer from the institution's youth. Other major sound and film archives in Sweden exist among private collectors and the national public broadcasting company [[Sveriges Radio]].

In April 2008, the Swedish government asked the [[National Library of Sweden]] to investigate and prepare for a merger between SLBA and the library by January 1, 2009.

== Migration ==
SLBA performed a mass-digitizing on parts of its collections, primarily focusing on public service material. Over a three-year period, an initial selection of 1.5 million hours of material were to be digitized and made available to researchers.

Most of the digitization process was automated. At full speed, 200 tapes per day, or 2,800 hours, were digitized by a staff of just five people. A number of relatively unconventional methods were being used, including the high-speed transfer of open-reel audiotapes, robotic automation of cassette-based audio and video transfer, and a suite of custom scripts that process the digitized files automatically.

The infrastructure includes a migration asset management system developed inhouse that handles such things as communication with production systems, logistics (of both original carriers and resultant files), and metadata input and transfer. Once the digitization process is completed, automatic functions create new carrier database records, insert metadata, direct the new archive and browsing files to their final mass storage locations, and link files to the MARC based database for direct access.

'''Teen court''' (sometimes called '''youth court''' or '''peer court''') is a [[problem-solving courts|problem-solving court]] within the [[juvenile justice system]] where teens charged with certain types of offenses can be sentenced by a jury of same-aged peers.&lt;ref name=santafe&gt;{{cite news|last1=Motsinger|first1=Gabe|title=Teen Court offers young misdemeanor offenders a path to redemption|url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/life/teen/teen-court-offers-young-misdemeanor-offenders-a-path-to-redemption/article_04606158-e18f-5d28-b6fa-80c9b0520517.html|accessdate=May 22, 2017|work=The Santa Fe New Mexican|date=April 27, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Their purpose is to provide an alternative disposition for [[juvenile (law)|juvenile]]s who have committed a [[Juvenile delinquency|delinquent]] act, have committed a [[infraction|minor offense]], or have been charged with a [[misdemeanor]], and are otherwise eligible for [[Diversion program|diversion]].  Depending on their training, community support, and agreements with traditional court systems, most teen or youth courts are recognized as valid, legal venues for the process of [[Hearing (law)|hearing cases]], [[Sentence (law)|sentencing]] and sentence fulfillment. Teen courts and their verdicts are not authorized by [[public law]].

==Court Structure==
Teen courts are staffed by youth [[Volunteering|volunteer]]s who serve in various capacities within the program, trained and [[Acting (law)|acting]] in the roles of [[juror]]s, [[lawyer]]s, [[bailiff]]s, [[court clerk|clerk]]s and [[judge]]s.  Teen courts usually function in cooperation with local [[juvenile court]]s and [[youth detention center]]s, middle and high schools, and/or community organizations such as the [[YMCA]].  Most teen courts are sentencing courts in which the offender has already admitted guilt or pleaded [[Nolo contendere|no contest]].

Many teen courts operate much like a traditional [[court]], holding hearings before a judge and jury with the jury deliberating to determine an appropriate disposition.  Other courts employ different structures, such as a judge-panel model which includes a panel of 3 to 6 youth judges who collectively hear, deliberate, and sentence the offender.

Often, sentences will involve the defendant's making [[restitution]] to someone harmed or inconvenienced by their actions, or creating an informational awareness project about [[health]], [[safety]], [[respect]], or another topic relevant to the offense. One of the more common sentences is community service. In many jury-based programs it is mandatory that the offender serve on a teen court jury.  In some cases, educational workshops are required as part of the sentence, usually in cases involving [[alcohol (drug)|alcohol]] or [[drug]] charges.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20071121182405/http://www.alachuasheriff.org/programs/juvenille/tc/Volunteer%20Information%20Form%202007.pdf]&lt;/ref&gt;

Youth volunteers may be eligible for school or [[community service]] credits through their schools, and community awards such as the [[President's Volunteer Service Award]].  Adult volunteers serve as trainers, advisors and coordinators of the teen courts; some courts have a small paid staff.

==Principles &amp; results==
Teen or youth courts provide an alternative court system through which juvenile [[offender]]s can be heard and judged by their [[Peer group|peers]].  Most teen courts have strict guidelines for youth volunteers who participate in the sentencing process, which generally includes [[training]], a modified [[bar exam]], [[peer mentoring]] and compliance with a [[code of conduct]].  Many youth courts establish a youth [[bar association]] or [[ethics]] body which helps to set [[guideline]]s for ethical and fair procedure.

Because cases heard by teen courts are ''real'' cases, participants in teen court programs are required to sign an [[oath]] of [[confidentiality]] regarding any information which comes to their knowledge in the course of the teen court case presentation.

State-approved teen courts implement [[restorative justice]] and attempt to reintegrate the youth offender to the community while sending appropriate messages to the offender regarding unacceptable behavior.  The basic principles of restorative justice are community protection, competency development, and accountability.  This system seeks to address the root causes of juvenile offenses and to reduce [[recidivism]]. The [[recidivism rate]]s for standard programs in several states range from 6%-9%, which is less than half of the traditional recidivism rate for juvenile offenders, which hovers around 20%.

Restorative justice principles require the offender to make amends to the victim and/or the community and provide opportunities for victims and community members to participate in the [[juvenile justice]] process, providing valued input in [[decision making]].  Because of the active role the victim plays, qualitative assessments can be made into victim impact and victim satisfaction.

A '''tuna''' (also called '''[[wiktionary:tunny|tunny]]''') is a saltwater [[fish]] that belongs to the [[tribe (biology)|tribe]] '''Thunnini''', a subgrouping of the [[Scombridae]] (mackerel) family.  The Thunnini comprise 15 [[species]] across five [[genera]],&lt;ref name=Graham2004/&gt; the sizes of which vary greatly, ranging from the [[bullet tuna]] (max. length: {{convert|50|cm|ft|abbr=on}}, weight: {{convert|1.8|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}) up to the [[Atlantic bluefin tuna]] (max. length: {{convert|4.6|m|ft|0|abbr=on}}, weight: {{convert|684|kg|lb|0|abbr=on}}). The bluefin averages {{convert|2|m|ft|abbr=on}}, and is believed to live up to 50 years.

Tuna, [[opah]], and [[Lamniformes|mackerel sharks]] are the only species of fish that can maintain a body temperature higher than that of the surrounding water. An active and agile predator, the tuna has a sleek, streamlined body, and is among the fastest-swimming [[pelagic]] fish&amp;nbsp;– the [[yellowfin tuna]], for example, is capable of speeds of up to {{Convert|75|km/h|mph|abbr=on}}.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Block|first=Barbara A.|author2=Booth, David |author3=Carey, Francis G. |title=Direct measurement of swimming speeds and depth of blue marlin|journal=Journal of Experimental Biology|year=1992|volume=166|pages=267–284|url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/166/1/267.full.pdf|accessdate=19 September 2012|publisher=Company of Biologists Ltd.|format=PDF|issn=0022-0949}}&lt;/ref&gt; Found in warm seas, it is extensively fished commercially, and is popular as a game fish. As a result of [[overfishing]], stocks of some tuna species, such as the [[southern bluefin tuna]], are close to [[extinction]].&lt;ref name=IUCNmaccoyii /&gt;

==Etymology==
The term "tuna" ultimately derives from ''{{lang|la|Thunnus}}'', the [[Middle Latin]] form of the {{lang-grc|θύννος|(thýnnos)|tunny-fish}}&amp;nbsp;– which is in turn derived from {{lang|grc|θύνω}} {{transl|grc|(''thýnō'')}}, "rush, dart along".&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|qu/nnos|θύννος|longref}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{LSJ|qu/nw|θύνω|shortref}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the immediate source for the word tuna in English is American Spanish &lt; Spanish ''atún'' &lt; Andalusian Arabic ''at-tūn'', assimilated from ''al-tūn'' التون [Modern Arabic التن] : 'tuna fish' &lt; Greco-Latin ''thunnus'' mentioned above.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.ahdictionary.com/word/search.html?q=tuna&amp;submit.x=0&amp;submit.y=0|title=American Heritage Dictionary Entry: tuna|author=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt Publishing Company|work=ahdictionary.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Taxonomy==
The Thunnini tribe is a [[monophyletic]] [[clade]] comprising 15 species in five [[genera]]:
:* family [[Scombridae]]
:** '''tribe Thunnini: the tunas'''
:*** genus ''[[Allothunnus]]:'' slender tunas

The [[cladogram]] is a tool for visualizing and comparing the evolutionary relationships between [[taxa]], and is read left-to-right as if on a timeline. The following cladogram illustrates the relationship between the tunas and other tribes of the family Scombridae.  For example, the cladogram illustrates that the [[skipjack tuna]]s are more closely related to the [[true tunas]] than are the [[slender tuna]]s (the most primitive of the tunas), and that the next nearest relatives of the tunas are the [[bonito]]s of the Sardini tribe.&lt;ref name=Graham2004/&gt;

===True tuna species===
[[File:Tuna Relative Sizes.jpg|thumb|Relative sizes of various tunas, with the [[Atlantic bluefin tuna]] (top) at about {{convert|8|ft|m|abbr=on}} in this sample]]
The "true" tunas are those that belong to the genus ''Thunnus''.  Until recently, it was thought that there were seven ''Thunnus'' species, and that [[Atlantic bluefin tuna]] and [[Pacific bluefin tuna]] were [[subspecies]] of a single species. In 1999, Collette established that based on both molecular and morphological considerations, they are in fact distinct species.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite conference|last=Collette |first=B.B. |conference=5th Indo-Pacific Fish Conference: Nouméa, New Caledonia, 3–8 November 1997 |editor=Séret, B. |editor2=Sire, J.Y. |title=Mackerels, molecules, and morphology|year=1999|publisher=Société Française d'Ichtyologie [u.a.] |booktitle=Proceedings |location=Paris|isbn=978-2-9507330-5-4 |pages=149–164 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-0cWAQAAIAAJ&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=Kn4ST9TDEaX_mAWn4IHGAw&amp;ved=0CDUQ6AEwAA}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Tanaka2006&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Tanaka |first1=Y. |first2=K. |last2=Satoh |first3=M. |last3=Iwahashi |first4=H. |last4=Yamada |title=Growth-dependent recruitment of Pacific bluefin tuna ''Thunnus orientalis'' in the northwestern Pacific Ocean |journal=Marine Ecology Progress Series |year=2006 |volume=319 |pages=225–235 |url=http://cat.inist.fr/?aModele=afficheN&amp;cpsidt=18108521 |doi=10.3354/meps319225}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The genus ''Thunnus'' is further classified into two [[subgenera]]: ''Thunnus ([[Thunnus (subgenus)|Thunnus]])'' (the bluefin group), and ''Thunnus ([[Neothunnus (subgenus)|Neothunnus]])'' (the yellowfin group).

[[File:Thunnus obesus (Bigeye tuna) diagram cropped.GIF|thumb|[[Bigeye tuna]] ''Thunnus obesus'' showing finlets and keels. Finlets are found between the last dorsal and/or anal fin and the caudal fin. They are rayless and non-retractable.&lt;br/&gt;Drawing by Dr Tony Ayling]]

===Description===
The tuna is a sleek and streamlined fish, adapted for speed.  It has two closely spaced [[dorsal fins]] on its back; The first is "depressible"&amp;nbsp;– it can be laid down, flush, in a groove that runs along its back. Seven to ten yellow [[Pterygiophore|finlets]] run from the dorsal fins to the tail, which is lunate&amp;nbsp;– curved like a crescent moon&amp;nbsp;– and tapered to pointy tips. The [[caudal peduncle]], to which the tail is attached, is quite thin, with three stabilizing horizontal [[Homocercal|keels]] on each side. The tuna's dorsal side is generally a metallic dark blue, while the ventral side, or underside, is silvery or whitish, for [[camouflage]].&lt;ref name=RISeaGrant&gt;{{cite web|last=Gibbs |first=E. |title=Fact Sheet: Tuna #P1412 |url=http://seagrant.gso.uri.edu/factsheets/tuna.html |publisher=Rhode Island Sea Grant |accessdate=20 September 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120712070954/http://seagrant.gso.uri.edu/factsheets/tuna.html |archivedate=July 12, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Physiology===
''Thunnus'' are widely but sparsely distributed throughout the oceans of the world, generally in tropical and temperate waters at [[latitude]]s ranging between about [[45th parallel north|45° north]] and [[45th parallel south|south]] of the equator.&lt;ref name="ISSF"/&gt; All tunas are able to maintain the temperature of certain parts of their body above the temperature of ambient seawater. For example, bluefin can maintain a core body temperature of {{Convert|25|-|33|C|F}}, in water as cold as {{Convert|6|C|F}}. However, unlike "typical" endothermic creatures such as mammals and birds, tuna do not maintain temperature within a relatively narrow range.&lt;ref name=muscletemp&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sepulveda |first1=C.A. |last2=Dickson |first2=K.A. |last3=Bernal |first3=D. |last4=Graham |first4=J.B. |title=Elevated red myotomal muscle temperatures in the most basal tuna species, ''Allothunnus fallai'' |journal=Journal of Fish Biology |date=1 July 2008 |volume=73 |issue=1 |pages=241–249 |doi=10.1111/j.1095-8649.2008.01931.x |url=http://216.172.180.32/~pier/userdocs/images/files/scientific_publications/Sepulveda%20et%20al.%202008%20.pdf |accessdate=2 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130207000108/http://216.172.180.32/~pier/userdocs/images/files/scientific_publications/Sepulveda%20et%20al.%202008%20.pdf |archivedate=February 7, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=tbot&gt;{{cite web |url=http://science.jrank.org/pages/7020/Tuna-Biology-tuna.html |title=Tuna&amp;nbsp;– Biology of Tuna |accessdate=September 12, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tunas achieve [[endothermy]] by conserving the heat generated through normal [[metabolism]]. In all tunas, the heart operates at [[ambient temperature]], as it receives cooled blood, and coronary circulation is directly from the [[gills]].&lt;ref name=SERCA2/&gt; The ''[[rete mirabile]]'' ("wonderful net"), the intertwining of veins and arteries in the body's periphery, allows nearly all of the metabolic heat from [[venous blood]]&lt;!-- NOT arterial --&gt; to be "re-claimed" and transferred to the [[arterial blood]]&lt;!-- NOT venous --&gt; via a [[counter-current exchange]] system, thus mitigating the effects of surface cooling.&lt;ref name=Cech1984&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Cech |first1=J.J. |last2=Laurs |first2=R.M. |last3=Graham |first3=J.B. |year=1984 |title=Temperature-induced changes in blood gas equilibria in the albacore, ''Thunnus alalunga'', a warm-bodied tuna |journal=Journal of Experimental Biology |volume=109 |issue=1 |pages=21–34 |url=http://jeb.biologists.org/content/109/1/21.full.pdf|format=PDF |quote=Oxygenated blood that has just reached thermal equilibrium with ambient sea water in the gills enters the rete on the arterial side, while warmed, deoxygenated, and carbon dioxide-laden blood enters on the venous end. In the rete, countercurrent flow and the high surface area contact between the two blood supplies facilitate the transfer of nearly all of the metabolic heat in the venous blood to arterial blood, thus conserving muscle temperature. After exiting the rete, arterial blood continues to the red muscle capillary beds, and cooled venous blood flows to the gills where carbon dioxide is excreted and oxygen is loaded. }}&lt;/ref&gt; This allows the tuna to elevate the temperatures of the highly-[[aerobic respiration|aerobic]] tissues of the skeletal muscles, eyes and brain,&lt;ref name=muscletemp/&gt;&lt;ref name=SERCA2&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Landeira-Fernandez |first1=A.M. |last2=Morrissette |first2=J.M. |last3=Blank |first3=J.M. |last4=Block |first4=B.A. |title=Temperature dependence of the Ca&lt;sup&gt;2+&lt;/sup&gt;-ATPase (SERCA2) in the ventricles of tuna and mackerel|journal=American Journal of Physiology.

Also unlike most fish, which have white flesh, the muscle tissue of tuna ranges from pink to dark red. The red [[myotome|myotomal]] muscles derive their color from [[myoglobin]], an oxygen-binding molecule, which tuna express in quantities far higher than most other fish.  The oxygen-rich blood further enables energy delivery to their muscles.&lt;ref name=muscletemp/&gt;

For powerful swimming animals like [[dolphins]] and tuna, [[cavitation]] may be detrimental, because it limits their maximum swimming speed.&lt;ref name=speedlimit&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Iosilevskii|first1=G|last2=Weihs|first2=D|title=Speed limits on swimming of fishes and cetaceans|journal=Journal of The Royal Society Interface|date=6 March 2008|volume=5|issue=20|pages=329–338|doi=10.1098/rsif.2007.1073|url=http://rsif.royalsocietypublishing.org/content/5/20/329.full.pdf|accessdate=13 July 2014|quote=Lacking pain receptors on their caudal fins, scombrids may temporarily cross the cavitation limit, and cavitation-induced damage has been observed (Kishinouye 1923); on the other hand, delphinids probably cannot cross it without pain (Lang 1966)|pmc=2607394}}&lt;/ref&gt; Even if they have the power to swim faster, dolphins may have to restrict their speed, because collapsing cavitation bubbles on their tail are too painful. Cavitation also slows tuna, but for a different reason. Unlike dolphins, these fish do not feel the bubbles, because they have bony fins without nerve endings. Nevertheless, they cannot swim faster because the cavitation bubbles create a vapor film around their fins that limits their speed. Lesions have been found on tuna that are consistent with cavitation damage.&lt;ref name=speedlimit/&gt;

===Commercial fishing===
Tuna is an important [[commercial fishing|commercial fish]]. The [[International Seafood Sustainability Foundation]] (ISSF) compiled a detailed scientific report on the state of global tuna stocks in 2009, which includes regular updates.  According to the ISSF, the most important species for commercial and recreational tuna fisheries are yellowfin (''Thunnus albacares''), bigeye (''T. obesus''), bluefin (''T. thynnus'', ''T. orientalis'', and ''T. macoyii''), albacore (''T. alalunga''), and skipjack (''Katsuwonus pelamis'').&lt;ref name="ISSF"&gt;{{cite web

Based on catches from 2007, the report states:

{{quote|Between 1940 and the mid-1960s, the annual world catch of the five principal market species of tunas rose from about 300 thousand tons to about 1 million tons, most of it taken by hook and line. With the development of [[Seine fishing|purse-seine]] nets, now the predominant gear, catches have risen to more than 4 million tons annually during the last few years. Of these catches, about 68 percent are from the Pacific Ocean, 22 percent from the Indian Ocean, and the remaining 10 percent from the Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Skipjack makes up about 60 percent of the catch, followed by yellowfin (24 percent), bigeye (10 percent), albacore (5 percent), and bluefin the remainder.

The Australian government alleged in 2006 that [[Japan]] had illegally [[overfished]] southern bluefin by taking 12,000 to 20,000 tonnes per year instead of the agreed upon 6,000 tonnes; the value of such overfishing would be as much as US$2&amp;nbsp;billion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2006-10-16/bluefin-tuna-plundering-catches-up-with-japan/1286956 |last=Bradford |first=Gillian |title=Bluefin Tuna Plundering Catches Up With Japan |publisher=ABC News |date=October 16, 2006 |accessdate=11 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Such overfishing has severely damaged bluefin stocks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2009/11/28/AR2009112801066.html |last=Eilperin |first=Juliet |title=Global approach now favored for marine conservation |publisher=Washington Post |date=November 29, 2009 |accessdate=11 August 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[World Wide Fund for Nature|WWF]], "Japan's huge appetite for tuna will take the most sought-after stocks to the brink of commercial [[extinction]] unless fisheries agree on more rigid quotas".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news

In recent years, opening day fish auctions at Tokyo's [[Tsukiji fish market]] have seen record-setting prices for bluefin tuna, reflecting market demand.  In each of 2010, 2011, 2012 and 2013, new record prices have been set for a single fish&amp;nbsp;– the current record is 155.4&amp;nbsp;million [[japanese yen]] (US$1.76&amp;nbsp;million) for a {{convert|221|kg|lb|abbr=on}} bluefin, or a unit price of JP¥&amp;nbsp;703,167/kg (US$3,603/lb).

In November 2011, a different record was set when a fisherman in [[Massachusetts]] caught an {{convert|881|lb|kg|abbr=on}} tuna. It was captured inadvertently using a dragnet. Due to the laws and restrictions on tuna fishing in the United States, federal authorities impounded the fish because it was not caught with a rod and reel. Because of the tuna's deteriorated condition as a result of the trawl net, the fish sold for just under $5,000.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.yahoo.com/blogs/sideshow/man-catches-881-pound-tuna-seized-feds-194650751.html |title=Man catches 881-pound tuna, seized by feds &amp;#124; The Sideshow&amp;nbsp;– Yahoo!

Besides for edible purposes, many tuna species are caught frequently as game, often for recreation or for contests in which money is awarded based on weight. Larger specimens are notorious for putting up a fight while hooked, and have been known to injure people who try to catch them, as well as damage their equipment.

* [[Phoenicia]]n technique for trapping and catching [[Atlantic bluefin tuna]] called ''[[Almadraba]]'', still used today in Portugal, Spain, Morocco &amp; Italy which uses a maze of nets. In Sicily, the same method is called ''[[Tonnara]]''.

===Association with whaling===
In 2005, [[Nauru]], defending its vote from Australian criticism at that year's meeting of the [[International Whaling Commission]], argued that some [[whale]] species have the potential to devastate Nauru's tuna stocks, and that Nauru's food security and economy relies heavily on fishing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Dorney |first=Sean |url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2005-06-28/nauru-defends-whaling-vote/2046680 |title=Nauru defends whaling vote. 28/06/2005. ABC News Online |publisher=Abc.net.au |date=2005-06-28 |accessdate=2012-04-12}}&lt;/ref&gt; Despite this, Nauru does not permit [[whaling]] in its own waters and does not allow other fishing vessels to take or intentionally interact with marine mammals in its Exclusive Economic Zone. In 2010 and 2011 Nauru supported Australian proposals&lt;ref name=Aus_PS_mammal&gt;{{cite web|last=Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission |title=Australia Proposals to Address the Impact of Purse Seine Fishing Activity on Cetaceans |url=http://wcpfc.int/system/files/documents/meetings/regular-sessions-commission/eighth-regular-session/delegation-proposals-and-paper/WCPFC8-2011-DP-15B-%28Rev-2%29-Australia-Proposals-Address-Impact-Purse-Seine-Fishing-Activity-Cetaceans.pdf |publisher=WCPFC |accessdate=11 April 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121101065208/http://wcpfc.int/system/files/documents/meetings/regular-sessions-commission/eighth-regular-session/delegation-proposals-and-paper/WCPFC8-2011-DP-15B-%28Rev-2%29-Australia-Proposals-Address-Impact-Purse-Seine-Fishing-Activity-Cetaceans.pdf |archivedate=November 1, 2012 }}&lt;/ref&gt; for a western Pacific-wide ban on tuna purse-seining in the vicinity of marine mammals&amp;nbsp;– a measure which was agreed by the Western and Central Pacific Fisheries Commission at its eighth meeting in March 2012.

===Association with dolphins===

[[Dolphin]]s swim beside several tuna species. These include yellowfin tuna in the eastern Pacific Ocean, but not [[albacore]]. Tuna schools are believed to associate themselves with dolphins for protection against sharks, which are tuna [[predator]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/border/ensenada.html |title=ENSENADA: El Puerto del Atun |publisher=Journalism.berkeley.edu |accessdate=2010-09-22 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100524134557/http://journalism.berkeley.edu/projects/border/ensenada.html |archivedate=2010-05-24 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Commercial fishing vessels used to exploit this association by searching for dolphin pods. Vessels would encircle the pod with nets to catch the tuna beneath,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Dolphin-safe tuna|publisher=Whale and Dolphin Conservation|url=http://www.wdcs-na.org/text/story_details.php?select=308|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130927135421/http://www.wdcs-na.org/text/story_details.php?select=308|archivedate=2013-09-27|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; however the nets were prone to entangling dolphins, injuring or killing them. Public outcry and new government regulations, which are now monitored by [[NOAA]] have led to more "dolphin friendly" methods, now generally involving lines rather than nets. However, there are neither universal independent inspection programs nor verification of "dolphin safeness", so these protections are not absolute. According to [[Consumers Union]], the resulting lack of accountability means claims of tuna that is "[[dolphin safe label|dolphin safe]]" should be given little credence.

Fishery practices have changed to be dolphin friendly, which has caused greater [[bycatch]] including [[shark]]s, [[turtle]]s and other [[oceanic fish]]. Fishermen no longer follow dolphins, but concentrate their fisheries around floating objects such as [[fish aggregation device]]s, also known as FADs, which attract large populations of other organisms. Measures taken thus far to satisfy the public demand to protect dolphins can be potentially damaging to other species as well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|publisher=Southern Fried Science| title=The ecological disaster that is dolphin safe tuna |url=http://southernfriedscientist.wordpress.com/2009/02/16/the-ecological-disaster-that-is-dolphin-safe-tuna/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Aquaculture===

Increasing quantities of high-grade tuna are reared in net pens and fed bait fish. In Australia, former fishermen raise [[southern bluefin tuna]], ''Thunnus maccoyii'', and another bluefin species.&lt;ref name=doolette&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Doolette, DJ  |author2=Craig, D

==As food==
The fresh or frozen flesh of tuna is widely regarded as a delicacy in most areas where it is shipped, being prepared in a variety of ways for the sake of achieving specific flavors or textures. When served as a [[steak]], the meat of [[Tuna#Taxonomy|most species]] is known for its thickness and tough texture.

===Canned===
{{See also|Canned fish|Canned_fish#Tuna|label 2=Canned tuna fish}}
[[File:Canned and packaged tuna on supermarket shelves.jpg|thumb|right|Canned tuna on sale|alt=Small cans on grocery shelves]]

When tuna is canned and packaged for sale, the product is sometimes called '''tuna fish'''. [[Canned fish|Canned]] tuna was first produced in Australia in 1903, quickly becoming popular.&lt;ref name=Choice2004&gt;[[Choice magazine|Choice]]: Jan/Feb 2004.&lt;/ref&gt; Tuna is canned in edible [[Vegetable oil|oil]]s, in [[brine]], in water, and in various sauces. Tuna may be processed and labeled as "solid", "chunked" or "flaked". When canned, the product is often referred to as "tuna fish", a [[calque]] (loan translation) from the [[German language|German]] ''[[wikt:Thunfisch|Thunfisch]]''.

In the United States, 52% of canned tuna is used for [[tuna sandwich|sandwich]]es; 22% for [[Tuna salad|tuna salads]]; and 15% for [[tuna casserole]]s and dried and prepackaged meal kits, such as [[General Mills]]'s [[Hamburger Helper|Tuna Helper]] line.&lt;ref name="modernmarvels"&gt;"Tuna". ''Modern Marvels'', 4 February 2010.&lt;/ref&gt; Depending upon the color of the flesh of the tuna species, the can is marked as "light" or "white" meat, with "light" meaning a greyish pink color and "white" meaning a light pink color. In the United States, only albacore can legally be sold in canned form as "white meat tuna";&lt;ref&gt;Ellis, Richard.  ''Tuna: A Love Story.'' New York: Random House, 2009, p. 119. {{ISBN|0-307-38710-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; in other countries, yellowfin is also acceptable. While in the early 1980s canned tuna in Australia was most likely [[Southern bluefin tuna|Southern bluefin]], {{As of|2003|lc=on}} it was usually yellowfin, skipjack, or tongol (labelled "northern bluefin" or "longtail").&lt;ref name=Choice2004 /&gt;

As tunas are often caught far from where they are processed, poor interim conservation can lead to spoilage. Tuna is typically gutted by hand, and later pre-cooked for prescribed times of 45 minutes to three hours. The fish are then cleaned and [[Fish fillet|filleted]], canned, and sealed, with the dark lateral blood meat often separately canned for pet food.  The sealed can is then heated under pressure (called [[pressure cooking|retort cooking]]) for 2 to 4 hours.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt; This process kills any bacteria, but retains the [[histamine]] that [[Scombroid food poisoning|may have been produced by those bacteria]]. The international standard sets the maximum histamine level at 200 milligrams per kilogram. An Australian study of 53 varieties of unflavored canned tuna found none to exceed the safe histamine level, although some had "off" flavors.&lt;ref name=Choice2004 /&gt;

Australian standards once required cans of tuna to contain at least 51% tuna, but these regulations were dropped in 2003.&lt;ref name=Choice2003&gt;[[Choice magazine|Choice]], August 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.choice.com.au/viewArticle.aspx?id=104101&amp;catId=100406&amp;tid=100008&amp;p=2&amp;title=Test:+Canned+tuna+(archived)]  {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080801143345/http://www.choice.com.au/viewArticle.aspx?id=104101&amp;catId=100406&amp;tid=100008&amp;p=2&amp;title=Test%3A+Canned+tuna+%28archived%29 |date=August 1, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The remaining weight is usually oil or water. In the US, the [[Food and Drug Administration]] (FDA) regulates canned tuna (see part ''c'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.accessdata.fda.gov/scripts/cdrh/cfdocs/cfcfr/CFRSearch.cfm?fr=161.190 |title=CFR&amp;nbsp;– Code of Federal Regulations Title 21 |publisher=Accessdata.fda.gov |accessdate=2010-09-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among those calling for improved warnings about mercury in tuna is the [[American Medical Association]], which adopted a policy that physicians should help make their patients more aware of the potential risks.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/health/chi-0512130114dec13,0,4864620,full.story | work=Chicago Tribune | title=How safe is tuna? | first1=Sam | last1=Roe | first2=Michael | last2=Hawthorne | date=2005-12-13 | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091126023316/http://www.chicagotribune.com/features/health/chi-0512130114dec13,0,4864620,full.story | archivedate=2009-11-26 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; A study published in 2008 found that mercury distribution in the meat of farmed tuna is inversely related to the lipid content, suggesting that higher lipid concentration within edible tissues of tuna raised in captivity might, other factors remaining equal, have a diluting effect on mercury content.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal

However, the [[BBC]] documentary ''[[South Pacific (TV series)|South Pacific]]'', which first aired in May 2009, stated that, should fishing in the Pacific continue at its current rate, populations of all tuna species could collapse within five years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode |title=Fragile Paradise |series=South Pacific |credits=Produced and directed by Jonathan Clay |network=BBC |station=BBC Two |airdate=2009-06-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; It highlighted huge Japanese and European tuna fishing vessels, sent to the South Pacific international waters after overfishing their own fish stocks to the point of collapse.

A 2010 tuna fishery assessment report, released in January 2012 by the Secretariat of the Pacific Community, supported this finding, recommending that all tuna fishing should be reduced or limited to current levels and that limits on skipjack fishing be considered.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="34940">Several [[Credit rating agency|credit rating agencies]] around the world have downgraded their credit ratings{{POV statement|date=February 2014}} of the [[Federal government of the United States|U.S. federal government]], including [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] (S&amp;P) which reduced the country's rating from AAA (outstanding) to AA+ (excellent) on August 5, 2011.

==2011==

The 2011 S&amp;P downgrade was the first time the government was given a rating below AAA. S&amp;P had announced a negative outlook on the AAA rating in April 2011. The downgrade to AA+ occurred four days after the [[112th United States Congress]] voted to raise the [[debt ceiling]] of the federal government by means of the [[Budget Control Act of 2011]] on August 2, 2011. Later, the US Government commenced an investigation into S&amp;P's role in the rating of several mortgage backed securities which played a role in the 2008 financial crisis.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Louise | last = Story | title = U.S. Inquiry Is Said to Focus on S.&amp;P.

S&amp;P announced on August 23, 2011 that Deven Sharma would step down as a Chief of Standard &amp; Poor's effective September 12, 2011, and would leave the company by end of the year.

The downgrade was criticized by the [[United States Department of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Department]],&lt;ref name="USTreas20110805"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.treasury.gov/connect/blog/Pages/Just-the-Facts-SPs-2-Trillion-Mistake.aspx |title=Just the Facts: S&amp;P's $2 Trillion Mistake |last=Bellows |first =John |publisher=[[United States Department of the Treasury]] |date=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; both [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democratic]]&lt;ref name="Admin20110807" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBC20110808" /&gt; and [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]]&lt;ref name="usatoday.com" /&gt;&lt;ref name="politico1" /&gt; political figures, and many business people and economists.&lt;ref name="BB20110806" /&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="redstate1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="WT20110808" /&gt;

Moody's, however, changed its outlook to negative on June 2, 2011 and Fitch changed its outlook to negative on November 28, 2011.&lt;ref name="calmes1"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Matt | last = Egan | title = Fitch Keeps U.S. Credit Rating at ‘AAA’, Cuts Outlook to Negative | url = http://www.foxbusiness.com/economy/2011/11/28/fitch-keeps-us-credit-rating-at-aaa-cuts-outlook-to-negative/ | work = [[Fox Business Network]] | date = November 28, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[credit rating]] is issued by a credit rating agency (CRA). A credit rating assigned to U.S. sovereign debt is an expression of how likely the assigning CRA thinks it is that the U.S. will pay back its debts. A credit rating assigned to U.S. sovereign debt also influences the interest rates the U.S. will have to pay on its debt; if its debtholders know the debt will be paid back, they do not have to price the chance of default into the interest rate. However, it should be noted that these ratings sometimes measure different things; for instance Moody's considers the expected value of the debt in the event of a default in addition to the [[probability of default]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| first = Felix | last = Salmon | title = The difference between S&amp;P and Moody's | url=http://blogs.reuters.com/felix-salmon/2011/08/09/the-difference-between-sp-and-moodys/ | work=Reuters | date=August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some lenders also have contractual requirements only to hold debt above a certain credit rating.&lt;ref name="eye_on_the_economy"&gt;{{cite web| author = Schoen, John W. | url=http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/42643641/ns/business-eye_on_the_economy/ |title= S&amp;P Goes Negative on US Outlook for First Time&amp;nbsp;– Rating Agency Doubts Whether Congress Will Move Toward Balancing Budget | publisher = [[MSNBC]] |date=April 19, 2011 |accessdate= August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. government enjoys the highest credit rating ("AAA"/"Aaa") from two of the [[Big Three (credit rating agencies)|Big Three]] CRAs. The U.S. enjoyed the "gold standard" of triple-A ratings from all three agencies (Fitch, Moody's and S&amp;P) from the time of their recognition as standards by the SEC until the S&amp;P downgrade in early August 2011.

Government agencies such as the [[Government Accountability Office]], the [[Congressional Budget Office]], the [[Office of Management and Budget]] and the U.S. Treasury Department have all reported that the federal government is facing a series of important financing challenges. In the short-run, tax revenues have declined significantly due to a severe [[recession]] and tax-policy choices, while expenditures have expanded for wars, unemployment insurance and other safety net spending.&lt;ref&gt;{{registration required|date=August 2011}} [[Paul Krugman|Krugman, Paul]] essay (May 2011).

===Warnings of a downgrade===
On April 18, 2011, U.S.-based rating agency S&amp;P issued a "negative" outlook on the U.S.'s "AAA" (highest quality) sovereign-debt rating for the first time since the rating agency began in 1860, indicating there was a one-in-three chance of an outright reduction in the rating over the next two years. S&amp;P considered the [[government budget deficit]] of more than 11 percent of [[gross domestic product]] (GDP), and net [[United States public debt|government debt]] rising to about 80 percent or more of GDP by 2013, to be high relative to other "AAA" countries.&lt;ref name=S&amp;PAprilResearch/&gt; According to S&amp;P, meaningful progress towards balancing the budget would be required to move the U.S. back to a "stable" outlook.&lt;ref name="eye_on_the_economy"/&gt; The S&amp;P press release stated: "We believe there is a material risk that U.S. policymakers might not reach an agreement on how to address medium– and long-term budgetary challenges by 2013; if an agreement is not reached and meaningful implementation is not begun by then, this would, in our view, render the U.S. fiscal profile meaningfully weaker than that of peer 'AAA' sovereigns."&lt;ref name=S&amp;PAprilResearch&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.standardandpoors.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobheadername3=MDT-Type&amp;blobcol=urldata&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobheadervalue2=inline%3B+filename%3DResearchUpdate_US_Outlook_4_18_11.pdf&amp;blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobheadername1=content-type&amp;blobwhere=1243900974568&amp;blobheadervalue3=UTF-8 |title=United States of America 'AAA/A-1+' Rating Affirmed; Outlook Revised to Negative |publisher= [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] |date=April 18, 2011 |accessdate=August 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="S&amp;P04182011pressrelease"&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.standardandpoors.com/ratings/articles/en/us/?assetID=1245302886884 |title= 'AAA/A-1+' Rating on United States of America Affirmed; Outlook Revised to Negative |publisher= [[Standard &amp; Poor's]] |date= April 18, 2011 |accessdate= August 9, 2011 |archive-url= https://web.archive.org/web/20110807031045/http://www.standardandpoors.com/ratings/articles/en/us/?assetID=1245302886884# |archive-date= 2011-08-07 |dead-url= yes |df=  }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June, Moody's followed suit, warning that if Congress did not quickly raise the debt ceiling above $14.3&amp;nbsp;trillion, the agency might reduce the debt rating. Moody's also commented on the political process, warning that the heightened polarization on both sides increased the risk of a default.&lt;ref name="calmes1"&gt;{{registration required|date=August 2011}} {{cite news|author=Calmes, Jackie|title=Fight over Debt Ceiling Risks Credit Rating, Moody's Warns|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/06/03/us/politics/03congress.html?hp|accessdate=June 3, 2011|work =[[The New York Times]]|date=June 2, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On July 14, 2011, S&amp;P issued a research update putting the U.S. debt on a 90-day CreditWatch.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.standardandpoors.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobheadername3=MDT-Type&amp;blobcol=urldata&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobheadervalue2=inline%3B+filename%3DUnitedStatesofAmerica_AAAA_7_14_11.pdf&amp;blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobheadername1=content-type&amp;blobwhere=1243932109521&amp;blobheadervalue3=UTF-8 "United States of America 'AAA/A-1+' Ratings Placed on CreditWatch Negative on Rising Risk of Policy Stalemate"]. [[Standard &amp; Poor's]].  July 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

On July 16, 2011, [[Egan-Jones Rating Company]], a smaller CRA, cut its rating from AAA to AA+, the first NRSRO to do so.&lt;ref&gt;Detrixhe, John (July 18, 2011).

Retrieved August 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===S&amp;P rationale for the downgrade===
On August 5, 2011, representatives from S&amp;P announced the company's decision to give its first-ever downgrade to U.S. sovereign debt, lowering the rating one notch to "AA+", with a negative outlook.&lt;ref name=Swann-Augpr&gt;{{cite web |author= Press release |title=United States of America Long-Term Rating Lowered to 'AA+' Due to Political Risks, Rising Debt Burden; Outlook Negative|url=http://www.standardandpoors.com/ratings/articles/en/us/?assetID=1245316529563|date=August 5, 2011|publisher=[[Standard &amp; Poor's]] |accessdate=August 5, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Swann-Aug&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.standardandpoors.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobheadername3=MDT-Type&amp;blobcol=urldata&amp;blobtable=MungoBlobs&amp;blobheadervalue2=inline%3B+filename%3DUS_Downgraded_AA%2B.pdf&amp;blobheadername2=Content-Disposition&amp;blobheadervalue1=application%2Fpdf&amp;blobkey=id&amp;blobheadername1=content-type&amp;blobwhere=1243942957443&amp;blobheadervalue3=UTF-8 |title=United States of America Long-Term Rating Lowered to 'AA+' on Political Risks and Rising Debt Burden; Outlook Negative |publisher=[[Standard &amp; Poor's]] |date=August 5, 2011 |accessdate=August 7, 2011 |archive-url=https://www.webcitation.org/69i2qTnkW?url=http://www.standardandpoors.com/servlet/BlobServer?blobheadername3=MDT-Type |archive-date=August 6, 2012 |dead-url=yes |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Governance and policy-making stability====
S&amp;P was direct in its criticism of the governance and policy-making process, which took the U.S. to the brink of default as part of the [[United States debt-ceiling crisis of 2011|2011 U.S. debt-ceiling crisis]] that same week:

*"More broadly, the downgrade reflects our view that the effectiveness, stability, and predictability of American policymaking and political institutions have weakened at a time of ongoing fiscal and economic challenges to a degree more than we envisioned when we assigned a negative outlook to the rating on April 18, 2011. Since then, we have changed our view of the difficulties in bridging the gulf between the political parties over fiscal policy, which makes us pessimistic about the capacity of Congress and the Administration to be able to leverage their agreement this week into a broader fiscal consolidation plan that stabilizes the government's debt dynamics any time soon."&lt;ref name=Swann-Aug/&gt;
*"The political brinksmanship of recent months highlights what we see as America's governance and policymaking becoming less stable, less effective, and less predictable than what we previously believed. The statutory debt ceiling and the threat of default have become political bargaining chips in the debate over fiscal policy. Despite this year's wide-ranging debate, in our view, the differences between political parties have proven to be extraordinarily difficult to bridge, and, as we see it, the resulting agreement fell well short of the comprehensive fiscal consolidation program that some proponents had envisaged until quite recently. Republicans and Democrats have only been able to agree to relatively modest savings on discretionary spending while delegating to the Select Committee decisions on more comprehensive measures. It appears that for now, new revenues have dropped down on the menu of policy options. In addition, the plan envisions only minor policy changes on Medicare and little change in other entitlements, the containment of which we and most other independent observers regard as key to long-term [[fiscal sustainability]]."&lt;ref name=Swann-Aug/&gt;

====Revenues====
S&amp;P revised the revenue assumptions underlying one of their future debt-level projections:

*"Compared with previous projections, our revised base case scenario now assumes that the 2001 and 2003 tax cuts, due to expire by the end of 2012, remain in place. We have changed our assumption on this because the majority of Republicans in Congress continue to resist any measure that would raise revenues, a position we believe Congress reinforced by passing the [[Budget Control Act of 2011|act]]."&lt;ref name=Swann-Aug/&gt;

====Improving the rating====
The report specifically refused to take a position on the blend of policy choices necessary to improve or maintain the credit rating:
*"Standard &amp; Poor's takes no position on the mix of spending and revenue measures that Congress and the Administration might conclude is appropriate for putting the U.S.'s finances on a sustainable footing.&lt;ref name=Swann-Aug/&gt;

===Criticism===
Both Democratic and Republican politicians criticized S&amp;P's decision, as well as placing blame with the other party. Few blamed themselves despite bi-partisan Congressional responsibility for passing budget deficits from 2002 onward&lt;ref&gt;{{dead link|date=August 2011}} [http://www.cbo.gov/ftpdocs/120xx/doc12039/HistoricalTables%5B1%5D.pdf "CBO Historical Tables"].  [[Congressional Budget Office]].&lt;/ref&gt; and significant deficits for the 2012–2021 periods in [[President of the United States|U.S. President]] [[Barack Obama]]'s [[2012 United States federal budget|2012 federal budget]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.whitehouse.gov/omb/budget "OMB-President's 2012 Budget"].  [[White House]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====From the Obama administration====
Almost immediately after S&amp;P announced the downgrade, first reported after 8 p.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Boak, Josh |author2=Brown, Carrie Budoff | url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0811/60778.html |title=U.S. Credit Rating Downgraded | work = [[Politico (newspaper)|Politico]] |date= August 5, 2011 |accessdate= August 9, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; on a Friday night, [[Obama administration]] officials began to publicly criticize S&amp;P's decision.&lt;ref name="Admin20110807"&gt;Abstract {{subscription required|date=August 2011}}. {{cite news|author1=Meckler, Laura |author2=O'Connor, Patrick |url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424053111903454504576492724028210348 |title=White House Challenges S&amp;P Decision |work = [[The Wall Street Journal]] |date= August 7, 2011|accessdate= August 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====From Republican political figures====
Republican strategists blamed Democratic intransigence for the rating agency's decision, and many Republican presidential candidates blamed the actions of Obama:&lt;ref name="politico1"/&gt;

*[[Tim Pawlenty]]: Pawlenty pinned the blame on Obama, calling him "inept when it comes to creating the conditions or job creation and economic growth". He called for a new direction and president.&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/washington/2011-08-06-GOP-reaction-credit-downgrade_n.htm | work=USA Today | title=Most Popular E-mail Newsletter | date=August 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Jon Huntsman, Jr.|Jon Huntsman]]: Huntsman blamed “out-of-control spending and a lack of leadership in Washington" noting that the country needs "new leadership in Washington committed to fiscal responsibility, a balanced budget, and job-friendly policies".&lt;ref name="usatoday.com"/&gt;
*[[Mitt Romney]]: Romney blamed Obama's failed "leadership on the economy". He noted that "the only way things will get better is with new leadership in the White House."{{citation needed|date=August 2011}}
*Rep. [[Michele Bachmann]]: Bachmann noted that Obama "has destroyed the credit rating of the United States through his failed economic policies and his inability to control government spending by raising the debt ceiling". She called on Obama to seek the resignation of [[United States Secretary of the Treasury|U.S. Treasury Secretary]] [[Timothy Geithner]] and "to submit a plan with list of cuts to balance the budget this year, turn our economy around and put Americans back to work."&lt;ref name="politico1"/&gt;

====From Democratic political figures====
Democratic politicians placed the blame for the downgrade on Republicans or elements of the Republican Party.

*Senator [[John Kerry]] referred to this as the "Tea Party downgrade," blaming Republican intransigence regarding revenues and disregard for the consequences of a default.&lt;ref name="MSNBC20110808"&gt;[http://www.msnbc.msn.com/id/3032608/vp/44050235#44050235 "Meet the Press-Senator John Kerry-August 8, 2011"].  [[MSNBC]].&lt;/ref&gt;

====From commentators====
In addition to the Obama administration's criticism, several &lt;!-- thuggish --&gt;liberal commentators, among them billionaire [[Warren Buffett]] and [[Nobel Memorial Prize]] winner [[Paul Krugman]], also criticized the downgrade. Michael Moore demanded Obama "show some guts" and have the head of Standard &amp; Poors arrested.&lt;ref name="BB20110806"&gt;{{cite news|author1=Liu, Betty  |author2=Frye, Andrew |lastauthoramp=yes |title=Buffett Says S&amp;P's Downgrade Mistaken, Still Doesn't See Another Recession|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-06/buffett-says-s-p-s-downgrade-mistaken-still-doesn-t-see-another-recession.html|date=August 6, 2011|publisher= [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]]|accessdate=August 7, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="washingtonpost1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="redstate1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nytimes1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="WT20110808"&gt;Morton, Victor (August 8, 2011).

Retrieved August 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Michael Allen (journalist)|Mike Allen's]] ''Politico Playbook'', "As a result of an error in constructing discretionary spending levels underlying the analysis, the deficit was $2 trillion higher over 10 years than the Congressional Budget Office would estimate. Treasury flagged the discrepancy to S&amp;P, which admitted a mistake."&lt;ref name="politico1"/&gt;

Commentators pointed out that a downgrade might result in an increase in interest rates required to finance U.S. debt, potentially raising interest costs.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=S&amp;P downgrades U.S. credit rating|first=Charles|last=Riley|url=http://money.cnn.com/2011/08/05/news/economy/downgrade_rumors/index.htm|publisher=CNN Money|date=6 August 2011|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An August 7, 2011, editorial by [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]] mentioned that several other countries downplayed the downgrade.&lt;ref&gt;Editorial (August 7, 2011).  [https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2011-08-08/s-p-s-dubious-downgrade-of-u-s-is-a-reminder-on-revenues-view.html "S&amp;P's Dubious Downgrade of U.S. Is a Reminder on Revenue: View"]. [[Bloomberg L.P.|Bloomberg]].  Retrieved August 10, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Market consequences===
Global stock markets declined on August 8, 2011, following the announcement.  All three major U.S. stock indexes declined between five and seven percent in one day. However, [[United States Treasury security|U.S. treasury bonds]], which had been the subject of the downgrade, actually rose in price and the dollar gained in value against the [[Euro]] and the [[pound sterling|British pound]], indicating a general flight to safe assets amid concerns about a European debt crisis.&lt;ref&gt;Sweet, Ken (August 8, 2011). [http://money.cnn.com/2011/08/08/markets/markets_newyork/index.htm?iref=BN1&amp;hpt=hp_t1 "Dow Plunges After S&amp;P Downgrade"].  [[CNNMoney.com]].  Retrieved August 14, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, based on historical information from Bloomberg, the cost to insure U.S. debts against default had risen from an average of around 25 basis points in 2007 to a range from 55 to 75 basis points in 2011.{{cn|date=June 2016}} A higher cost of insurance is typically associated with increased risk of default.

==2012==
Although none of the Big Three took any downgrade action in 2012, Egan-Jones downgraded twice further.  After its initial rating cut on July 16, 2011 from AAA to AA+, Egan-Jones cut its rating a second time on April 5, 2012 from AA+ to AA "because of the lack of any tangible progress on addressing the problems and the continued rise in debt to GDP."&lt;ref name=Leong&gt;{{cite news|last=Leong|first=Richard|title=Egan-Jones cuts U.S. rating on debt burden|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2012/04/06/ratings-usa-egan-idUSL2E8F629N20120406|accessdate=14 September 2012|agency=Reuters|date=6 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;  On September 14, 2012, Egan-Jones cut its rating a third time from AA to AA-, the lowest of what is considered "high grade", as a reaction to [[Quantitative easing#QE1.2C QE2.2C and QE3|QE3]].&lt;ref name=Detrixhe&gt;{{cite news|last=Detrixhe|first=John|title=Egan-Jones Cuts U.S. Rating to AA- After Fed Adds to Stimulus|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/news/2012-09-14/egan-jones-cuts-u-s-rating-to-aa-after-fed-adds-to-stimulus.html|accessdate=14 September 2012|agency=Bloomberg|date=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2013==
On October 15, 2013 the credit agency Fitch warned that it may cut the U.S. credit rating, citing the political brinkmanship over raising the federal debt ceiling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Bases|first=Daniel|title=Fitch warns it may cut U.S. credit rating from AAA|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/16/us-usa-fitch-idUSBRE99E12H20131016|accessdate=16 October 2013|date=16 October 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 17, 2013 [[Dagong Global Credit Rating]] downgraded the United States from A to A-, and maintained a negative outlook on the country's credit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2013/10/17/idUSL3N0I71YW20131017 |title=DAGONG DOWNGRADES US TO A- FROM A |publisher=Reuters |date= |accessdate=2013-10-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2014==
Fitch Ratings on March 21, 2014 upgraded its outlook for the U.S. AAA credit rating, removing the nation from a downgrade watch after politicians put off another debt limit battle until next year.
The company, one of three major credit rating firms, changed the outlook for the rating to stable from a negative watch put in place in October.&lt;ref&gt;

==Potential consequences to credit rating agencies==
Two weeks after the August, 2011 S&amp;P downgrade, SEC and Department of Justice announced that S&amp;P was under investigation. Columnist Bob Sullivan of [[NBC News]] asked if "the ratings downgrade from Standard &amp; Poor’s [could] be viewed as a shot back at a government that's been taking plenty of shots at the ratings industry lately."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Was S&amp;P downgrade an act of revenge?|first=Bob|last=Sullivan|url=http://redtape.nbcnews.com/_news/2011/08/09/7321296-was-sp-downgrade-an-act-of-revenge?lite|agency=NBC News|date=9 August 2011|accessdate=14 September 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; And two years later in 2013, S&amp;P "blasted a $5 billion fraud lawsuit by the U.S. government as retaliation for its 2011 decision to strip the country of its AAA credit rating."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.cnbc.com/id/101005690 |title=S&amp;P calls US lawsuit retaliation for stripping AAA rating |date=3 September 2013 |publisher=[[CNBC]] |accessdate=5 September 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two weeks after the second downgrade by [[Egan-Jones]] in April 2012 to AA, the SEC voted to bring administrative action against that firm regarding years-old activity.  Mr. Egan said at the time, "We are not going to be intimidated by anybody from issuing timely, accurate ratings."&lt;ref name=Eaglesham&gt;{{cite news|last=Eaglesham|first=Jean|title=Ratings Firm Is in SEC Sights|url=https://www.wsj.com/articles/SB10001424052702303513404577354023825841812 |accessdate=14 September 2012|publisher=Wall Street Journal|date=19 April 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; After Egan-Jones agreed to a settlement in 2013, the SEC director [[Robert Khuzami]] said in a press release, "EJR and Egan's misrepresentation of the firm's actual experience rating issuers of asset-backed and government securities is a serious violation that undercuts the integrity of the SEC's NRSRO [[Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization|[Nationally Recognized Statistical Rating Organization]]] registration process."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |title=Egan-Jones and Founder Sean Egan Agree to 18-Month Bars from Rating Asset-Backed and Government Securities Issuers as NRSRO |url=https://www.sec.gov/News/PressRelease/Detail/PressRelease/1365171513724#.U-9VqPldUdY |location=Washington, DC |publisher=SEC |date=2013-01-22 |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; In response, a [[Fox Business Network]] editor raised the question of "government retaliation" and an Egan-Jones spokesman issued a [[non-apology apology]] stating that the "SEC settlement lets us focus on what we do best—producing the most accurate and independent ratings in the business."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.foxbusiness.com/government/2013/01/22/curious-case-sec-vs-egan-jones/ |title=The Curious Case of the SEC vs. Egan-Jones |last1=MacDonald |first1=Elizabeth |date=2013-01-22 |website=foxbusiness.com |publisher=Fox Business Network |accessdate=2014-08-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:SMOW-1 (VSMOW) original container.PNG|thumb|right|The original container of VSMOW (then called ''SMOW-1'') collected by Harmon Craig]]
'''Vienna Standard Mean Ocean Water''' ('''VSMOW''') is a water standard defining the [[isotope|isotopic]] composition of fresh water. It was promulgated by the [[International Atomic Energy Agency]] (based in Vienna) in 1968, and, since 1993, continues to be evaluated and studied by the IAEA along with the [[Europe]]an [[Institute for Reference Materials and Measurements]] and the [[United States|American]] [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]]. The standard includes both the established values of stable isotopes found in waters and calibration materials provided for standardization and interlaboratory comparisons of instruments used to measure these values in experimental materials.

The designation ''ocean water'' refers only to the evaporation of ocean waters in the [[water cycle]] as the original source of fresh surface and ground waters and precipitation, but VSMOW is not a standard for [[seawater]]. Fresh distilled VSMOW water is also used for making high accuracy measurement of water's physical properties and for defining laboratory standards since it is considered to be representative of average ocean water, in effect representing all water on Earth.

Before VSMOW was defined, average ocean water and melted snow were used as references.  These conventions were refined in the 1960s by the standardized definition of Standard Mean Ocean Water (SMOW). The U.S. National Bureau of Standards (now the [[National Institute of Standards and Technology]], NIST) created physical water standards for global use.  However, the physical integrity of the U.S. standards came into question. The use of the SMOW standard was discontinued.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hornberger|first1=George M.|title=New manuscript guidelines for the reporting of stable hydrogen, carbon, and oxygen isotope ratio data|journal=Water Resources Research|date=1995|volume=31|issue=12|pages=2895–2895|doi=10.1029/95WR02430|bibcode=1995WRR....31.2895H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

VSMOW is a recalibration of the original SMOW definition and was created in 1967 by [[Harmon Craig]] and other researchers from [[Scripps Institution of Oceanography]] at the [[University of California, San Diego]] who mixed [[distilled]] ocean waters collected from different spots around the globe. VSMOW remains one of the major [[Reference Materials for Stable Isotope Analysis|isotopic water benchmarks]] in use today.

==Composition==
The isotopic composition of VSMOW water is specified as ratios of the [[mole (unit)|molar]] abundance of the rare isotope in question divided by that of its most common isotope and is expressed as [[Parts per notation|parts per million (ppm)]]. For instance [[oxygen-16|&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O]] (the most common isotope of oxygen with eight protons and eight neutrons) is roughly 2632 times more prevalent in sea water than is [[oxygen-17|&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O]] (with an additional neutron). The isotopic ratios of VSMOW water are defined as follows:

*[[deuterium|&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;H]]/[[hydrogen-1|&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H]] = 155.76&amp;nbsp;±0.1&amp;nbsp;ppm (a ratio of 1 part per approximately 6420 parts)
*[[tritium|&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;H]]/&lt;sup&gt;1&lt;/sup&gt;H = 1.85&amp;nbsp;±0.36&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt;&amp;nbsp;ppm (a ratio of 1 part per approximately 5.41&amp;nbsp;×&amp;nbsp;10&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt; parts, ignored for physical properties-related work)
*[[oxygen-18|&lt;sup&gt;18&lt;/sup&gt;O]]/&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O = 2005.20&amp;nbsp;±0.43&amp;nbsp;ppm (a ratio of 1 part per approximately 498.7 parts)
*&lt;sup&gt;17&lt;/sup&gt;O/&lt;sup&gt;16&lt;/sup&gt;O = 379.9&amp;nbsp;±1.6&amp;nbsp;ppm (a ratio of 1 part per approximately 2632 parts)

It should be noted that every molecule of water has 2 hydrogen atoms, so if one considers 3210 (half of 6420) molecules of water and only one of the molecules of the 3210 has one of its two hydrogen atoms with the neutron, this gives the ratio of 1:6420 of deuterium, but there would only be a ratio of 1:3210 for HDO (which is 312 ppm of HDO water molecules). Furthermore, the number of molecules per million of {{chem|D|2|O}} (a molecule in which both hydrogen atoms are deuterium) would only be one molecule in about 10 million molecules. Probability dictates that the vast majority of molecules will have only 1 deuterium atom, not two; only if there were some rule that required water to have either two atoms of deuterium or no atoms of deuterium would the ratio of {{chem|D|2|O}} to {{chem|H|2|O}} to be the same as the ratio of deuterium to light hydrogen. This can be shown by imagining a "roulette wheel" with 6420 places and only one of them is red with the others green. The chance that the ball will land on red twice in a row is less than 1 in ten million, so a molecule of {{chem|D|2|O}} is extremely rare in normal water.  

If equal quantities of {{chem|H|2|O}} and {{chem|D|2|O}} were to be mixed together, the ratio of H to D would remain 1:1, but the ratio of {{chem|D|2|O}} to {{chem|H|2|O}} would soon change to 1:2:1 for {{chem|H|2|O}}, HDO and {{chem|D|2|O}}. This because some of the water would "capture" deuterium from the {{chem|D|2|O}} and the there would be an equilibrium with twice as much DHO as either {{chem|H|2|O}} or {{chem|D|2|O}}.  This exchange also occurs in normal water--an exchange between {{chem|D|2|O}} and HDO (or {{chem|H|2|O}} and HDO) gives a net result of zero, but an exchange between {{chem|H|2|O}} and {{chem|D|2|O}} results in HDO, and this is why the amount of {{chem|D|2|O}} is a somewhat less than the 1 in 6420-squared expected by probability.

==Use in temperature standards {{anchor|VSMOW in temperature measurement}} ==&lt;!--Linked from [[Celsius]]--&gt;
Very pure, carefully distilled VSMOW water is important in the manufacture of high-accuracy [[temperature]] measurement reference standards. Both the [[Kelvin]] and [[Celsius]] scales are defined by the [[triple point]] of water (273.16&amp;nbsp;K and 0.01&amp;nbsp;°C). Due to differences in isotopic composition, water samples from various sources may exhibit slight differences in physical properties, such as density, boiling point, and vapor pressure.  Consequently, snow, river water, and rainwater, all of which are recently evaporated ocean water, tend to be enriched in the lighter isotopes of hydrogen and oxygen, causing water to evaporate more quickly.

Temperature reference cells filled with water of improper isotopic composition can cause errors of several hundred [[microkelvin]] in the measured triple point.

To address this issue, the Comité International des Poids et Mesures (CPIM), also known as the [[International Committee for Weights and Measures]], affirmed in 2005&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bipm.fr/en/si/si_brochure/chapter2/2-1/kelvin.html International Kelvin definition]&lt;/ref&gt; that for the purposes of specifying the temperature of the triple point of water, the definition of the Kelvin thermodynamic temperature scale would refer to water with a composition of the nominal specification of VSMOW.&lt;ref group=notes&gt;[http://www.bipm.fr/utils/en/pdf/CIPM2005-EN.pdf (669 kB PDF) CIPM 2005 report] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061102231615/http://www.bipm.fr/utils/en/pdf/CIPM2005-EN.pdf |date=November 2, 2006 }} See pg. 235 of the document (Pg. 107 of the PDF) for ''Clarification of the definition of the kelvin, unit of thermodynamic  temperature.'' The CIPM's adoption of the VSMOW standard was based upon a recommendation of the [[International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry]] (IUPAC) in their publication [http://www.iupac.org/publications/pac/2003/7506/7506x0683.html ''Atomic Weights of the Elements: Review 2000 (IUPAC Technical Report)''], J. R. de Laeter ''et al.'', Pure and Applied Chemistry, '''75''', Issue 6, Pg. 683&amp;ndash;799.&lt;/ref&gt;  The decision was welcomed in 2007 by Resolution 10 of the 23rd CGPM.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.bipm.org/en/CGPM/db/23/10/&lt;/ref&gt;

One effect of defining the triple point of VSMOW as both 0.01&amp;nbsp;°C and 273.16&amp;nbsp;K is that neither the [[water (properties)|melting]] or [[water (properties)|boiling]] point of water under one standard atmosphere (101.325&amp;nbsp;kPa) remain defining points for the Celsius scale. In 1948, when the 9th General Conference on Weights and Measures ([[CGPM]]) in Resolution 3&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bipm.fr/en/CGPM/db/9/3/ CGPM Resolution 3]&lt;/ref&gt; first considered using the triple point of water as a defining point, the triple point was so close to being 0.01&amp;nbsp;°C greater than water's known melting point, it was simply defined as exactly 0.01&amp;nbsp;°C. However, current measurements show that the triple and melting points of VSMOW water are only {{gaps|0.009|911(10)}}&amp;nbsp;°C apart. Thus, the actual melting point of ice is {{gaps|+0.000|089(10)}}&amp;nbsp;°C. Also, defining water's triple point at 273.16&amp;nbsp;K defined the magnitude of each 1&amp;nbsp;°C increment in terms of the [[thermodynamic temperature|absolute thermodynamic temperature scale]] (referencing [[absolute zero]]). Now decoupled from the actual boiling point of water, the value ''100&amp;nbsp;°C'' is hotter than 0&amp;nbsp;°C, in absolute terms, by a factor of ''exactly'' &lt;math&gt;\textstyle\frac{373.15}{273.15}&lt;/math&gt; (approximately 36.61% thermodynamically hotter). When adhering ''strictly'' to the two-point definition for calibration, the boiling point of VSMOW water under one [[Standard_atmospheric_pressure#Standard_atmospheric_pressure|standard atmosphere]] of pressure is actually 373.1339&amp;nbsp;K (99.9839&amp;nbsp;°C). When calibrated to [[International Temperature Scale of 1990|ITS-90]] (a calibration standard comprising many definition points and commonly used for high-precision instrumentation), the boiling point of VSMOW water is slightly less, about 99.974&amp;nbsp;°C.

This boiling–point difference of 16.1 millikelvins between the Celsius scale's original definition and the current one (based on absolute zero and the triple point) has little practical meaning in real life because water's boiling point is highly sensitive to variations in barometric pressure. For example, an altitude change of only 28&amp;nbsp;cm (11&amp;nbsp;in) causes water's boiling point to change by one millikelvin.
