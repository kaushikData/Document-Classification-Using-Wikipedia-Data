In the '''Centralia mine disaster''' on March 25, 1947, the Centralia No. 5 [[coal mine]] exploded near the town of [[Centralia, Illinois]], killing 111 people.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://usminedisasters.miningquiz.com/saxsewell/centralia.htm|title=Centralia No. 5 Mine Explosion, Centralia, Illinois|last=United States Mine Rescue Association|first=|date=|website=Mine Disasters in the United States|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-06-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Mine Safety and Health Administration]] of the [[United States Department of Labor]] reported the explosion was caused when an underburdened shot or blown-out shot ignited [[coal dust]]. At the time of the explosion, 142 men were in the mine; 65 were killed by burns and other injuries and 45 were killed by [[afterdamp]]. Eight men were rescued, but one died from the effects of afterdamp.  Only 31 miners escaped.

==In popular culture==
American folksinger [[Woody Guthrie]] wrote and recorded a song about the Centralia mine disaster entitled ''The Dying Miner.''&lt;ref name=":0"/&gt; Guthrie's recording of the song is now available on the Smithsonian-Folkways recording ''Struggle'' (1990).  Songwriter [[Bucky Halker]] rearranged this song and recorded it for his ''Welcome to Labor Land'' CD (Revolting Records, 2002), a collection of Halker's renditions of labor songs from Illinois. Halker also recorded his version of "New Made Graves of Centralia" for his CD ''Don't Want Your Millions'' (Revolting Records, 2000).  Halker based his version on an original recording of this song in the Country Music Hall of Fame, but the author and recording artist were unknown.

Along with ''The Dying Miner,'' Guthrie wrote two other songs regarding the 1947 disaster: "Waiting at the Gate" (from  the perspective of a miner's son); and "Talking Centralia" (also known as "Talking Miner").

On 30 May 1990, three health officers, two from the Health Department of the [[Government of West Bengal]] and one from [[UNICEF]] were raped by a group of miscreants in Bantala Road when they were returning from Gosaba Rangabelia. One of the officers and their driver died while resisting the attackers.

== Incident ==
On 30 May 1990, a team of three health officers were returning to Kolkata after inspecting an immunization program in Gosaba.&lt;ref name="ts19900601-1"&gt;{{cite news|title=Woman Official lynched in Calcutta|date=1 June 1990|work=The Statesman|accessdate=|location=Kolkata}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sarkar|first=Tanika|date=1991|title=Reflections on Birati Rape Cases: Gender Ideology in Bengal|url=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4397275|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|volume=26|issue=5|pages=215–218}}&lt;/ref&gt; The team consisted of Anita Dewan, the Deputy District Extension Media Officer of the West Bengal Health Department; Uma Ghosh, a senior officer of the Health Department; and Renu Ghosh, a representative of UNICEF's [[World Health Organization]] office in New Delhi. Around 6:30 pm when they had reached Bantala near the [[E.M. Bypass|Eastern metropolitan bypass]], a group of 4-5 youths stopped their car near the [[Communist Party of India (Marxist)|CPI(M)]] party office.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=oMRUDwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PT139&amp;dq=bantala+rape+case&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwiUzMi44-bdAhUP2o8KHd1zCTcQ6AEILjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=bantala%20rape%20case&amp;f=false|title=The Whistle and The Hummingbirds|last=Malllick|first=Shyamadas|date=2018-04-09|publisher=Notion Press|year=|isbn=9781946515810|location=|pages=Section 2|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.co.in/books?id=Kh2keRsHhnwC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=Fields of Protest: Women's Movements in India|last=Ray|first=Raka|date=2000|publisher=Zubaan|year=|isbn=9788186706237|location=|pages=99|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; The driver Abani Naia made an attempt to escape, but he lost control and the car overturned. In the mean time, another gang of 10-12 youths arrived at the spot, who pulled one of the ladies out of the car, while the others pulled out the other two ladies. The driver of the car tried to resist the youths, but failed. The attackers killed the driver and set the car on fire.&lt;ref name="mw20101009-1"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.mainstreamweekly.net/article2365.html|title=Musings of a Pensionjivi on Sumanta Banerjee’s Letter|last=Bandyopadhyay|first=D|date=9 October 2010|work=Mainstream Weekly|accessdate=7 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; The lady officers were then taken to a nearby paddy field and raped. One of the ladies, who tried to resist the rapists was killed.

The police brought the naked bodies of the officers to the emergency department of [[Calcutta National Medical College]] at around 11:30 pm. Initially they were presumed to be dead, but later two of them was found to be alive and were admitted for treatment. One lady doctor who examined the dead woman fainted when she discovered a metallic torch in the vagina of the officer.

The injured driver was transferred to [[IPGMER and SSKM Hospital|SSKM Hospital]] for treatment. He bore 43 wounds in his body caused by blunt, sharp and heavy weapons.&lt;ref name="abp19900622-1"&gt;{{cite news|title=none|last=Sengupta|first=Sukhoranjan|date=22 June 1990|work=Anandabazar Patrika|language=bn|location=Kolkata}}&lt;/ref&gt; His penis was smashed by the attackers. On 4 June 1990 at 5:40 am, he died. The autopsy of his body was carried out by Dr. Biswanath Kahali, a Medical Officer on Training Reserve of the Health Department.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Investigation ==
[[Prasanta Sur]], the then Health Minister of West Bengal, defended the mob by contending that the victims might have been mistaken as child-abductors. But there is controversy regarding actual cause of the incident. The then Chief Minister Mr. [[Jyoti Basu]] also commented on a casual mode which has strongly been criticised by the media all over India.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hingsar Utsab|language=bn|last=Four decades of blood bath in Bengal|first=|publisher=Dip Prakashan|year=2011|isbn=|location=Kolkata|page=93|quote=|via=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://indiatoday.intoday.in/story/mamata-banerjees-kolkata-tarnished-by-string-of-crimes-against-women/1/334819.html|title=City of Joy to city of rapes: Kolkata sees string of crimes against women|access-date=2017-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|date=2015-06-05|title=Women, Rape and the Left|url=https://www.epw.in/journal/1991/5/prespectives-perspectives/women-rape-and-left.html|journal=Economic and Political Weekly|language=en|volume=26|issue=5}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the government carried out investigation and finally, the six accused in the case served life-imprisonment. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=CM vows justice for rape victims|url=http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/city/kolkata/CM-vows-justice-for-rape-victims/articleshow/40201815.cms|website=Times of India|publisher=Times of India|accessdate=6 September 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''accident on the Rampe de Laffrey''' on July 18, 1973, remains, {{As of|2017|lc=on}}, the worst to ever have occurred along [[Rampe de Laffrey|that stretch of roadway]], among the worst in [[France]].&lt;ref name=chretien&gt;[http://www.journalchretien.net/spip.php?article13675 Le Journal Chretien&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;  A [[bus]] was carrying [[Belgium|Belgian]] [[pilgrim]]s from [[Braine-le-Comte]] returning from a visit to the shrine of [[Our Lady of La Salette]]; it missed a [[curve]] at the base of the road, near its intersection with the bridge over the [[Romanche]], and overturned.  Forty-three people were killed and six injured in the resulting crash.&lt;ref name=chretien/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Some references give other numbers of injured; all agree on the number of dead.&lt;/ref&gt;  After the crash the [[mayor]] of [[Laffrey]] condemned the route as being particularly dangerous, as it had already claimed over one hundred lives over the previous quarter-century.&lt;ref name="Dauphine1"&gt;''Le Dauphiné Libéré'', July 23, 1973&lt;/ref&gt;

The accident is sometimes referred to as the '''accident de Vizille''' because it occurred very close to the entrance of the town of [[Vizille|that name]]; the crash site, however, is actually located within the boundaries of the [[communes of France|commune]] of [[Notre-Dame-de-Mésage]].  Today a memorial to the victims stands at the site of the accident; it claims the number of dead as forty-five.&lt;ref&gt;http://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/2/25/Rampe_de_Laffrey_Accident_du_18-juillet-1975.jpg&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="7183">[[File:Heinrich's triangle.PNG|thumb|A depiction of Heinrich's original ratios: 1 major injury to 29 minor injuries to 300 no-injury accidents]]
[[File:Pyramide des risques.svg|thumb|An expanded triangle with 1 death, 10 serious accidents, 30 minor accidents, 600 near misses and an unspecified number of unsafe acts, similar to that proposed by Bird in 1966]]

The '''accident triangle''' also known as '''Heinrich's triangle''' or '''Bird's triangle''' is a theory of industrial accident prevention.  It shows a relationship between serious accidents, minor accidents and [[near miss (safety)|near misses]] and proposes that if the number of minor accidents is reduced then there will be a corresponding fall in the number of serious accidents.  The triangle was first proposed by [[Herbert William Heinrich]] in 1931 and has since been updated and expanded upon by other writers, notably [[Frank E. Bird]].  It is often shown pictorially as a triangle or pyramid and has been described as a cornerstone of 20th century workplace [[health and safety]] philosophy.  In recent times it has come under criticism over the values allocated to each category of accident and for focusing only on the reduction in minor injuries.

== Development ==
The triangle shows a relationship between the number of accidents resulting in serious injury, minor injuries or no injuries.  The relationship was first proposed in 1931 by [[Herbert William Heinrich]] in his ''Industrial Accident Prevention: A Scientific Approach''.&lt;ref name=anderson&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Anderson |first1=Martin |last2=Denkl |first2=Michael |title=The Heinrich Accident Triangle - Too Simplistic A Model For HSE Management in The 21st Century? |journal=SPE International Conference on Health, Safety and Environment in Oil and Gas Exploration and Production |date=2010 |doi=10.2118/126661-MS |url=https://www.onepetro.org/conference-paper/SPE-126661-MS |accessdate=18 November 2018 |publisher=Society of Petroleum Engineers |language=english}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heinrich was a pioneer in the field of workplace health and safety.  He worked as an assistant superintendent for an insurance company and wanted to reduce the number of serious industrial accidents.  He commenced a study of more than 75,000 accident reports from the insurance company's files as well as records held by individual industry sites.&lt;ref name=johnson&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Johnson |first1=Ashley |title=Examining the foundation |journal=Safety &amp; Health |date=1 October 2001 |volume=National Safety Council Congress &amp; Expo |url=https://www.safetyandhealthmagazine.com/articles/print/6368-examining-the-foundation |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  From this data he proposed a relationship of one major injury accident to 29 minor injury accidents, to 300 no-injury accidents.  He drew the conclusion that, by reducing the number of minor accidents, industrial companies would see a correlating fall in the number of major accidents.&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt;&lt;ref name=anderson/&gt;  The relationship is often shown pictorially in the form of a triangle or pyramid.  The triangle was widely used in industrial health and safety programmes over the following 80 years and was described as a cornerstone of health and safety philosophy.&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt;&lt;ref name=anderson/&gt;  Heinrich's theory also suggested that 88% of all accidents were caused by a human decision to carry out an unsafe act.&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt;

The theory was developed further by [[Frank E Bird]] in 1966 based on the analysis of 1.7 million accident reports from almost 300 companies.  He produced an amended triangle that showed a relationship of one serious injury accident to 10 minor injury ([[first aid]] only) accidents, to 30 damage causing accidents, to 600 [[Near miss (safety)|near misses]].&lt;ref name=davies/&gt;  Bird showed a relationship between the number of reported near misses and the number of major accidents and claimed that the majority of accidents could be predicted and prevented by an appropriate intervention.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Hughes |first1=Phil |last2=Ferrett |first2=Ed |title=Introduction to Health and Safety at Work |date=2009 |publisher=Elsevier |isbn=9781856176682 |page=86 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=YhlKT43FNRAC |accessdate=18 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The numbers used by Bird were confirmed by a 1974 study by A. D. Swain, entitled ''The Human Element in Systems Safety''.&lt;ref name=davies&gt;{{cite book |last1=Davies |first1=John |last2=Ross |first2=Alastair |last3=Wallace |first3=Brendan |title=Safety Management: A Qualitative Systems Approach |date=2003 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9780415303712 |page=45 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=h7YixY365aQC |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The theory was later expanded upon by Bird and Germain in 1985's ''Practical Loss Control Leadership''.&lt;ref name=anderson/&gt;

== Criticism ==
Heinrich's triangle had a significant impact on health and safety culture in the 20th century but has recently been criticised.&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt;  Some of this criticism regards to the exact figures used in the relationship.  A 2010 report relating to he oil and gas industry showed that the original values only held true when applied to a large dataset and a broad range of activities.&lt;ref name=anderson/&gt;  A 1991 study showed that in confined spaces the relationship was significantly different: 1.2 minor injuries for each serious injury or death.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=McManus |first1=Neil |title=Safety and Health in Confined Spaces |date=1998 |publisher=CRC Press |isbn=9781566703260 |page=6 |url=https://books.google.co.uk/books?id=ygATMSwPbtAC |accessdate=18 November 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  A broad study of UK accident data in the mid 1990s showed a relationship of 1 fatality to 207 major injuries, to 1,402 injuries causing three or more days lost time injuries, to 2,754 minor injuries.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Health and Safety Executive |title=The cost to Britain of workplace accidents and work-related ill health in 1995/96 |date=1999 |isbn=978 0 7176 1709 8 |page=32 |url=http://www.hse.gov.uk/pUbns/priced/hsg101.pdf |accessdate=18 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Heinrich's original files have since been lost so his accident figures cannot be proven.&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt;

[[W. Edwards Deming]] stated that Heinrich's theory attributing human action as the cause of most accidents in the workplace was incorrect and it was, in fact, poor management systems that caused the majority of accidents.&lt;ref name=johnson/&gt;  There has also been criticism of the triangle for focusing attention on the reduction of minor accidents.  It has been claimed that this has led to workplace supervisors to ignore more serious but less likely risks when planning works in order to focus on reducing the likelihood of more common but less serious risks.  The 2010 oil and gas study claimed that this attitude had led to a halt in the reduction of fatalities in that industry in the preceding five to eight years, despite a significant reduction in minor accidents.&lt;ref name=anderson/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2621">'''Agnes, Viscountess Wenman''' (died 1617) was an English Roman Catholic woman, under suspicion of involvement at the time of the [[Gunpowder Plot]] of 1605.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite ODNB|id=29044|title=Wenman, Agnes|year=2004|last=Griffiths|first=Jane}}&lt;/ref&gt; She is correctly referred to either as '''Agnes Wenman''' or as '''Lady Wenman'''.

==Life==
She was the eldest surviving daughter of Sir George Fermor of [[Easton Neston]] in [[Northamptonshire]], by his wife Mary, daughter and heiress of Thomas Curzon. She came of a Catholic family, and was identified by the Rev. John Morris with the lady at whose house [[John Gerard (Jesuit)|John Gerard]], the Jesuit missionary, while disguised as a layman, had a keen discussion with [[George Abbot (archbishop)|George Abbot]], the future archbishop; it was on the eternal state of a puritan who threw himself from a church steeple because he was assured of salvation.

She was a friend of Mrs Elizabeth Vaux, the sister-in-law of [[Anne Vaux]], the ally of [[Henry Garnet]]. In consequence of some correspondence between them, suspicion fell on Lady Wenman at the time of the Gunpowder Plot, and she and her husband [[Richard Wenman, 1st Viscount Wenman]] were separately examined in December 1605. Sir Richard testified that he 'disliked their intercourse, because Mrs. Vaux tried to pervert his wife.' She was set at liberty after a short confinement in custody. She was buried at [[Twyford, Buckinghamshire|Twyford]] on 4 July 1617.

She is noted as the translator of the works of [[Johannes Zonaras]] from the French of [[Jan de Maumont]]. The translation is preserved in manuscript.&lt;ref&gt;In the Cambridge University Library, in two large folio volumes, and is entitled 'The Historyes and Chronicles of the World. By John Zonaras. . . . Digested into three Books. Done out of Greek into French. . . . With Aduertisements and Index of the most memorable things ... for John Parent in Saint James Street [Rue St. Jacques, Paris], M.D.LXXXIII. And done into English by the noble and learned lady Agnes Wenman, sometime wife of ... Richard Lord Vis-Count Wenman deceased.' The volumes appear to have been transcribed from Lady Wenman's autograph, of which a portion (corrected by the person who made the transcript) is in another manuscript in the library.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inaugural '''Anger Management Tour''' was founded and started in the fall of 2000 by [[Limp Bizkit]], [[Papa Roach]], and after the release of ''[[The Marshall Mathers LP]]'', [[Eminem]]. Originally targeted at both rap and rock fans, the first "Anger Management" outing took place in 2000. In the process of starting the large tour, Eminem wanted to include [[Nine Inch Nails]] into the list of artists, but [[Marilyn Manson]] joining the tour would raise the issues between him and [[Trent Reznor]]. Eminem decided to not ask Reznor to join the tour due to the friendship he has with Manson. Eminem also came up with the name for the tour, being quoted in ''[[Rolling Stone]]'' saying "It's the perfect name for a tour like this, because most of the music featured in the tour is about anger, frustration, and the bullshit of our lives and the fans loving every minute of it. It's the blend of hardcore rap, industrial metal, and alternative metal that gives it the anger management feel, literally."

In the first tour, most of the concerts were extremely long, due to the number of artists that were chosen to headline the massive tour. Many of the concerts were praised for the production value and how each artist played like it was their own tour. Many critics agreed that one of the great things about the concerts were that they felt like they were made up of mini concerts.

The second tour took place in the summer of 2002. [[Eminem]] told LAUNCH, "It's basically the same thing that it was the last Anger Management Tour without Limp Bizkit... Papa Roach are still cool though."
These concerts on the second tour were infamously just as long as the first time around, which in turn led to a controversial incident during a European Leg of the tour. During a stop in Milton Keynes, UK, fans grew restless and agitated at the prolonged 'stage changeovers' between artists and proceeded to throw bottles of liquid (liquor, water, and urine) at the stage. It is thought one of these bottles of liquid hit rapper Xzibit during his set, causing him to leave the stage having suffered a broken jaw.

The bottle throwing incident in Milton Keynes was referenced by Eminem and D12 in a song titled 'American Psycho 2', in which Em retorts 'go find out who did that shit to Xzibit, fill up a whole liquor bottle of piss and shatter his fucking face'

The third tour took place in the summer of 2005. [[50 Cent]] missed the tour's first two stops because of a scheduling conflict; he was tied up shooting his film debut. [[Ludacris]] filled in on those dates. The European part of the tour was cut short due to the exhaustion of tour founder [[Eminem]] and his addiction to sleeping pills.

'''Carl Forti''' (born June 29, 1972)&lt;ref&gt;http://www.politico.com/playbook/0612/playbook1822.html&lt;/ref&gt; is an American Republican Party strategist who is the political director of [[Karl Rove|Karl Rove's]] [[American Crossroads]] [[Super PACs|Super PAC]]. He was political director for [[Mitt Romney]] in 2008.&lt;ref name="motherjones1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Andy Kroll |url=http://motherjones.com/politics/2012/01/carl-forti-romney-super-PAC |title=Mitt Romney's $12 Million Mystery Man |publisher=Mother Jones |date= |accessdate=2012-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Prior to joining American Crossroads, Forti has co-founded the Black Rock Group and has been instrumental in the formation of Republican [[527's]] and [[Super PACs]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.blackrockgrp.com/teambio.php |title=Bios - Black Rock Group |publisher=Blackrockgrp.com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-18 }}{{dead link|date=November 2016 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; He has been referred to as "Karl Rove's Karl Rove", "one of the smartest people in politics you've never heard of," and "the Alexander the Great of the Republican independent expenditure world."&lt;ref name="motherjones1"/&gt;

== Political activities ==
Forti has long been active raising funds and strategy for the Republican Party. He got his start in the mid 1990s, working at a small ad firm run by GOP consultant, Paul Wilson and steadily moved through the ranks.&lt;ref name="politico1"&gt;{{cite web|last=Vogel |first=Kenneth P. |url=http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=BD9AF158-E23A-D4C3-55D010033B12565E |title=Karl Rove's Karl Rove - POLITICO.com Print View |publisher=Dyn.politico.com |date=2010-10-18 |accessdate=2012-03-18 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120317064542/http://dyn.politico.com/printstory.cfm?uuid=BD9AF158-E23A-D4C3-55D010033B12565E |archivedate=2012-03-17 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; While working at the [[Republican National Committee]] during the 2006 elections, Forti managed their largest ever independent expenditure campaign, totaling $82 million.&lt;ref name="politico1"/&gt; 

In 2008, Forti joined Mitt Romney's Presidential Campaign. As his political director, Forti played a key role behind Romney's 11 primary and caucus victories. After Romney dropped out, Forti joined [[Freedom Watch]], a [[501(c)(4)]] run by [[Sheldon Adelson]] with the goal of spending over $200 million for conservative causes. During the campaign, Freedom's Watch challenged [[Federal Election Commission]] (FEC) requirements to disclose their donors and ultimately won when the FEC ruled that outside spending groups didn't have to reveal their sources unless contributions were earmarked for specific ads.&lt;ref name="motherjones1"/&gt; 

In 2010, Forti attempted to circumvent FEC guidelines by using his firm, Black Rock Strategies to coordinate with campaigns and advise donors where to contribute. Ultimately the FEC rejected this approach. During the 2010 Elections, Black Rock Group worked on [[Joe DioGuardi|Joe DioGuardi's]] Senate Campaign while also doing work for [[American Crossroads]].&lt;ref name="politico1"/&gt;

In 2011, Forti helped establish the Romney supporting super-PAC, [[Restore Our Future]], raising over $12 million in the first half of 2011 before joining American Crossroads as its political director.&lt;ref name="motherjones1"/&gt;

=== Conflict of interest criticism ===
American Crossroads was accused of having conflicts of interest over the role of Carl Forti. American Crossroads defended Forti, telling [[Politico]], “Carl is a contract employee with American Crossroads. He has other clients. We knew that he had other clients. But clearly, none of us are gonna be involved personally in the presidential campaign.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.politico.com/news/stories/0611/57705.html |title=American Crossroads brass defend Carl Forti's role - Alexander Burns |publisher=Politico.Com |date= |accessdate=2012-03-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Cow tipping''' is the purported activity of sneaking up on any unsuspecting or sleeping upright [[Cattle|cow]] and pushing it over for entertainment.

Cows routinely lie down and can easily regain their footing unless sick or injured.  Scientific studies have been conducted to determine if cow tipping is theoretically possible, with varying conclusions.  All agree that cows are large animals that are difficult to surprise and will generally resist attempts to be tipped. Estimates suggest a force of between {{convert|3000|and|4000|N|abbr=off}} is needed, and that at least four and possibly as many as fourteen people would be required to achieve this. In real-life situations where cattle have to be laid on the ground, or "cast", such as for [[livestock branding|branding]], [[hoof]] care or veterinary treatment, either rope restraints are required or specialized mechanical equipment is used that confines the cow and then tips it over.  On rare occasions, cattle can lie down or fall down in proximity to a ditch or hill that restricts their normal ability to rise without help. Cow tipping has many references in popular culture and is also used as a [[figure of speech]].

The urban legend of cow tipping relies upon the presumption that cattle are slow-moving, dim-witted, and weak-legged, thus easily pushed over without much force. Some versions suggest that because cows sleep standing up, it is possible to approach them and push them over without the animals reacting.&lt;ref name="Haines" /&gt; However, cows only sleep lightly while standing up, and they are easily awakened.&lt;ref name = Cow1&gt;{{cite news |last = Malvern |first = Jack |title = Cow-Tipping Myth Hasn't Got a Leg to Stand On |publisher = Times Online |url = http://www.thetimes.co.uk/tto/news/uk/article1940322.ece |accessdate = October 28, 2006 |location = London |date = November 5, 2005 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110629083548/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article586737.ece |archivedate = June 29, 2011 |deadurl = yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; They lie down to sleep deeply.&lt;ref name=collins /&gt; Furthermore, numerous sources have questioned the practice's feasibility, since most cows weigh over half a ton and easily resist any lesser force.&lt;ref name = Cow1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last = Semke |first = Matt |title = The Statics of Cow Tipping |publisher = University of Nebraska – Lincoln (UNL) College of Engineering and Mechanics Course Project |url = http://emweb.unl.edu/Mechanics-Pages/Matt-Semke/The%20Statics%20of%20Cow%20Tipping.htm |accessdate = April 17, 2007 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080827083454/http://emweb.unl.edu/Mechanics-Pages/Matt-Semke/The%20Statics%20of%20Cow%20Tipping.htm |archivedate = August 27, 2008 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2005 study led by Margo Lillie, a [[zoology|zoologist]] at the [[University of British Columbia]], and her student Tracy Boechler, concluded that tipping a cow would require a force of nearly {{convert|3000|N}}&lt;ref name="Haines"&gt;{{cite news |last = Haines |first = Lester |title = Boffins Debunk Cow-Tipping Myth |newspaper = The Register |date = November 9, 2005 |accessdate = November 30, 2012 |url = https://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/11/09/cow_tipping |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20121031144516/http://www.theregister.co.uk/2005/11/09/cow_tipping/ |archivedate = October 31, 2012 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; and is therefore impossible to accomplish by a single person. Her calculations found that it would require more than four people to apply enough force to push over a cow,&lt;ref name="Haines" /&gt; based on an estimate that a single person could exert {{convert|660|N}} of force. However, since a cow can brace itself, Lillie and Boechler suggested that five or six people would, most likely, be needed.&lt;ref name=collins /&gt; Further, cattle are well aware of their surroundings and are very difficult to surprise, due to excellent senses of both smell and hearing.&lt;ref name=collins&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/10289862/Cow-tipping-myth-dispelled.html |title = Cow Tipping Myth Dispelled |first = Nick |last = Collins |work = [[The Daily Telegraph]] |date = September 6, 2013 |accessdate = May 18, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160426021919/http://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/science/science-news/10289862/Cow-tipping-myth-dispelled.html |archivedate = April 26, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Glenn&gt;{{cite news |first = Eddie |last = Glenn |url = http://tahlequahdailypress.com/archive/x519330324 |title = Cow-Tipping: Myth or Reality? |work = Tahlequah Daily Press |date = December 15, 2006 |accessdate = May 18, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Lillie and Boechler's analysis found that if a cow did not move, the principles of static physics suggest that two people might be able to tip a cow if its [[centre of mass]] were pushed over its hooves before the cow could react. However, cows are not rigid or unresponsive, and the faster humans have to move, the less force they can exert. Thus Lillie and Boechler concluded that it is unlikely that cows can actually be tipped over in this way.&lt;ref name="Haines" /&gt; Lillie stated, "It just makes the physics of it all, in my opinion, impossible."&lt;ref name=collins /&gt;

Although he agrees that it would take a force of about 3,000 newtons to push over a standing cow, biologist Steven Vogel thinks that the study by Lillie and Boechler overestimates the pushing ability of an individual human.&lt;ref name="Vogel" /&gt; Using data from Cotterell and Kamminga, who estimated that humans exert a pushing force of 280 newtons,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1 = Cotterell |first1 = Brian |last2 = Kamminga |first2 = Johan |title = Mechanics of Pre-industrial Technology : Introduction to the Mechanics of Ancient and Traditional Material Culture |date = 1992 |publisher = Cambridge University Press |location = Cambridge |isbn = 978-0-521-42871-2 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=0-xOM8y6Uc8C&amp;vq |via = Google Books }}&lt;/ref&gt; Vogel suggests that someone applying force at the requisite height to topple a cow might generate a maximum push of no more than 300 newtons. By this calculation, at least 10 people would be needed to tip over a non-reacting cow. However, this combined force requirement, he says, might not be the greatest impediment to such a prank. Standing cows are not asleep and like other animals have ever-vigilant reflexes. "If the cow does no more than modestly widen its stance without an overall shift of its center of gravity", he says, "about 4,000 newtons or 14 pushers would be needed—quite a challenge to deploy without angering the cow."&lt;ref name="Vogel"&gt;{{cite book |last = Vogel |first = Steven |title = Glimpses of Creatures in Their Physical Worlds |publisher = Princeton University Press |year = 2009 |page = 238 |url = https://books.google.com/books?id=qaOi_huPdfsC&amp;dq |isbn = 978-0-691-13806-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Historical origins ==

The belief that certain animals cannot rise if pushed over has historical antecedents, though cattle have never been so classified. [[Julius Caesar]] recorded a belief that a [[European elk]] had no knee joints and could not get up if it fell.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |publisher = Harper &amp; Brothers |location = New York |last = Caesar |first = Julius |author2 = Aulus Hirtius |title = Caesar's Commentaries on the Gallic and Civil Wars |chapter = XXVII |page = 154 |year = 1879 |isbn = 0-217-45287-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last = Caesar |first = Caius Julius |editor = Rhys, Ernest |translator = W.

Journalist Jake Steelhammer believes the American urban myth of cow tipping originated in the 1970s. It "stampeded into the '80s", he says, "when movies like ''[[Tommy Boy]]'' and ''[[Heathers]]'' featured cow tipping expeditions."&lt;ref name=Steelhammer2013&gt;{{citation|title=Settling a Beef with Cow Tipping|newspaper=[[Charleston Gazette-Mail]]|location=Charleston, West Virginia|date=September 22, 2013|last=Steelhammer|first=Rick|url=https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-35161437.html|via=[[HighBeam]] {{subscription required}}|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160220213216/https://www.highbeam.com/doc/1P2-35161437.html|archivedate=February 20, 2016|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; Stories about cow tipping tend to be second-hand, he says, told by someone who does not claim to have tipped a cow but who knows someone else who says he or she did.&lt;ref name=Steelhammer2013 /&gt;

== Veterinary and husbandry practices ==

[[File:Calf cradle.JPG|thumb|left|A calf cradle used for branding in Australia]]

Cattle may need to be deliberately thrown or tipped over for certain types of [[animal husbandry|husbandry]] practices and medical treatment.  When done for medical purposes, this is often called "casting", and when performed without mechanical assistance requires the attachment of {{convert|30|to|40|ft|m|0|abbr=off}} of rope around the body and legs of the animal. After the rope is secured by non-slip [[bowline]] knots, it is pulled to the rear until the animal is off-balance. Once the cow is forced to lie down in [[sternum|sternal]] recumbency (on its chest), it can be rolled onto its side and its legs tied to prevent kicking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Rope Squeeze |url = http://research.vet.upenn.edu/Dairy/Restraint/CastingRestraints/RopeSqueeze/tabid/3917/Default.aspx |website = Penn Veterinary Medicine |accessdate = May 16, 2016 |date = 2016 |deadurl = yes |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160523185855/http://research.vet.upenn.edu/Dairy/Restraint/CastingRestraints/RopeSqueeze/tabid/3917/Default.aspx |archivedate = May 23, 2016 |df = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Burley Method of Casting |url = http://cal.vet.upenn.edu/projects/fieldservice/Dairy/RESTR/burley.htm |website = New Bolton Center Field Service Department |accessdate = May 16, 2016 |date = 2003 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160525221519/http://cal.vet.upenn.edu/projects/fieldservice/Dairy/RESTR/burley.htm |archivedate = May 25, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A calf table or calf cradle, also called a "tipping table" or a "throw down", is a relatively modern invention designed to be used on [[calf|calves]] that are being [[livestock branding|branded]].  A calf is run into a [[cattle chute|chute]], confined, and then tipped by the equipment onto its side for easier branding and [[castration]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Working Calves in the Calf Table |url = http://thepioneerwoman.com/confessions/working-calves-in-the-calf-table/ |website = The Pioneer Woman |accessdate = May 16, 2016 |language = en-US |date = June 3, 2014 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title = Tipping Tables |url = http://www.starkeng.com.au/tipping-tables.php |website = Stark Engineering |accessdate = May 16, 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160405203814/http://starkeng.com.au/tipping-tables.php |archivedate = April 5, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hydraulic tilt tables for adult cattle have existed since the 1970s and are designed to lift and tip cattle onto their sides to enable veterinary care, particularly of the animals' [[genitalia]], and for [[hoof]] maintenance.&lt;ref name="Gunville" /&gt; (Unlike horses, cows generally do not cooperate with a [[farrier]] when standing.&lt;ref name=CTV /&gt;)  A Canadian veterinarian explained, "Using the table is much safer and easier than trying to get underneath to examine the animal", and noted that cows tipped over on a padded table usually stop struggling and become calm fairly quickly.&lt;ref name="Gunville"&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Gunville |first1 = Lynne |title = Vet Table Tilts a Cow's World |url = http://www.canadiancattlemen.ca/2014/10/28/vet-table-tilts-a-cows-world/ |website = Canadian Cattlemen |accessdate = May 16, 2016 |date = October 28, 2014 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160601082048/http://www.canadiancattlemen.ca/2014/10/28/vet-table-tilts-a-cows-world/ |archivedate = June 1, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  One design, developed at the [[Western College of Veterinary Medicine]] in Saskatoon, Saskatchewan, included "cow comfort" as a unique aspect of care using this type of apparatus.&lt;ref name=CTV&gt;{{cite news |url = http://saskatoon.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=498169 |title = Stephanie Massicotte Goes Cow Tipping with Veterinarian Dr. Chris Clark |work = [[CTV News]] |location = Saskatoon, Saskatchewan |publisher = Bell Media |year = 2016 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160610075849/http://saskatoon.ctvnews.ca/video?clipId=498169 |archivedate = June 10, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cows may tip themselves inadvertently.  Due to their bulk and relatively short legs, cattle cannot roll over. Those that lie down and roll to their sides with their feet pointing uphill may become stuck and unable to rise without assistance, with potentially fatal results.  In such cases, two humans can roll or flip a cow onto its other side, so that its feet are aimed downhill, thus allowing it to rise on its own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Swearingen |first1 = Jake |title = Cow Tipping Doesn't Exist — But Cow Flipping Does – Modern Farmer |url = http://modernfarmer.com/2013/09/cow-tipping-doesnt-exist-cow-flipping/ |website = Modern Farmer |accessdate = May 16, 2016 |language = en-US |date = September 9, 2013 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160526180102/http://modernfarmer.com/2013/09/cow-tipping-doesnt-exist-cow-flipping/ |archivedate = May 26, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
In one documented case of "real-life cow tipping", a pregnant cow rolled into a gully in [[New Hampshire]] and became trapped in an inverted state until rescued by [[volunteer fire fighters]].  The owner of the cow commented that he had seen this happen "once or twice" before.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = http://www.ledgertranscript.com/News/A-case-of-cow-tipping-on-Hancock-farmland-1321887 |title = A Case of Cow Tipping on Hancock Farmland |first = Ben |last = Conant |date = April 4, 2016 |newspaper = [[Monadnock Ledger-Transcript]] |location = Monadnock, New Hampshire |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160509170019/http://www.ledgertranscript.com/News/A-case-of-cow-tipping-on-Hancock-farmland-1321887 |archivedate = May 9, 2016 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Trauma or illness may also result in a cow unable to rise to its feet.  Such animals are sometimes called "[[downer (animal)|downers]]." Sometimes this occurs as a result of muscle and nerve damage from calving or a disease such as [[mastitis]].&lt;ref name=Downer /&gt;  Leg injuries, muscle tears, or a massive infection of some sort may also be causes.&lt;ref name="VanMetre"&gt;{{cite web |last1 = Van Metre |first1 = David C. |last2 = Garry |first2 = Frank B. |title = Figuring out down cows |url = http://www.cvmbs.colostate.edu/ilm/proinfo/wdn/2008/WDN%20Dec%20downers.pdf |format = PDF |work = Western Dairy News |accessdate = May 16, 2016 |date = December 2008 |deadurl = no |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20130129113039/http://www.cvmbs.colostate.edu/ilm/proinfo/wdn/2008/WDN%20Dec%20downers.pdf |archivedate = January 29, 2013 |df = mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; Downer cows are encouraged to get to their feet and have a much greater chance of recovery if they do. If unable to rise, some have survived—with medical care—as long as 14 days and were ultimately able to get back on their feet. Appropriate medical treatment for a downer cow to prevent further injury includes rolling from one side to the other every three hours, careful and frequent feeding of small amounts of [[fodder]], and access to clean water.&lt;ref name=Downer&gt;{{cite web |title = The Downer Cow |url = http://www.thecattlesite.com/diseaseinfo/246/the-downer-cow/ |website = The Cattle Site |accessdate = May 16, 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Death ===

Dead animals may appear to have been tipped over.

Pranksters have sometimes pushed over artificial cows.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13822">'''David Atlee Phillips''' (October 31, 1922 – July 7, 1988) was a [[Central Intelligence Agency]] officer of 25 years and a recipient of the [[Career Intelligence Medal]]. Phillips rose to become the CIA's chief of operations for the [[Western hemisphere]]. In 1975 he founded the [[Association of Former Intelligence Officers]] (AFIO), an [[alumni]] association comprising [[Intelligence (information gathering)|intelligence]] officers from all services.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://www.afio.com/01_about.htm |title=About Us |publisher=Afio.com |date=2009-08-26 |accessdate=2017-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life and military career==
Phillips was born in [[Fort Worth, Texas]]&lt;ref name="The New York Times; July 10, 1988"&gt;{{cite news |last=Saxon |first=Wolfgang |date=July 10, 1988 |title=David Atlee Phillips Dead at 65; Ex-Agent Was Advocate of C.I.A. |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1988/07/10/obituaries/david-atlee-phillips-dead-at-65-ex-agent-was-advocate-of-cia.html |newspaper=The New York Times |location= |access-date=July 17, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and attended [[The College of William and Mary]] in [[Williamsburg, Virginia]] and [[Texas Christian University]] in Fort Worth.&lt;ref name="The New York Times; July 10, 1988"/&gt; Phillips was an [[actor]] prior to [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="The New York Times; July 10, 1988"/&gt; During the war, he served as a [[nose gunner]] in the [[United States Army Air Forces]]. He was shot down over [[Austria]] and captured by the Germans, but was somehow able to escape and make it back to [[Allies of World War II|Allied]] lines.&lt;ref name="The New York Times; July 10, 1988"/&gt;

==CIA career==
Phillips joined the CIA as a part-time agent in 1950 in [[Chile]], where he owned and edited "The South Pacific Mail", an [[English language|English]]-[[language]] [[newspaper]] that circulated throughout [[South America]] and several islands in the [[Pacific Ocean|Pacific]]. He became a full-time operative in 1954, and operated a major [[psychological warfare]] campaign in Guatemala during the [[1954 Guatemalan coup d'état|US coup]] and its [[PBHistory|aftermath]].&lt;ref&gt;Max Holland, "Operation PBHISTORY: The Aftermath of SUCCESS", ''[[International Journal of Intelligence and CounterIntelligence]]'' 17(2),  2004, p. 305. "At one time an aspiring actor, David Atlee Phillips was fluent in Spanish and fresh from working under contract to the CIA during PBSUCCESS. Under the pseudonym 'Paul D. Langevin,' Phillips had been the Agency's chief liaison and advisor to ''La Voz de la Liberación'', one of the most effective tools in the psychological warfare  waged against Arbenz."&lt;/ref&gt; He rose through the ranks to intelligence officer, chief of station and eventually chief of [[Western hemisphere]] operations, serving primarily in [[Latin America]], including [[Cuba]], [[Mexico]], and the [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref&gt;Fonzi, Gaeton. ''The Last Investigation'', (New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, 1993), pp. 263-266. {{ISBN|1-56025-052-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; Phillips retired from the agency in 1975 and founded the [[Association of Former Intelligence Officers]] in the same year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=AFIO Copyright 2006 |url=http://www.afio.com/01_about.htm |title=About Us |publisher=AFIO |date=2009-08-26 |accessdate=2017-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==House Select Committee on Assassinations==
While investigating [[Lee Harvey Oswald|Lee Harvey Oswald's]] possible ties to certain radical groups around the time of the [[assassination of President John F. Kennedy]], the [[HSCA]] obtained statements from [[Alpha 66]] founder [[Antonio Veciana]] that Oswald had met on several occasions with a CIA operative known as "Maurice Bishop".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jfk-online.com/daphscavec.html |title=Antonio Veciana and "Maurice Bishop" : House Select Committee on Assassinations |volume=X |pages=37-56 |website=Jfk-online.com |date= |accessdate=2017-05-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fonzi, Gaeton.

''The Last Investigation'', (New York: Thunder's Mouth Press, 1993), p. 396. {{ISBN|1-56025-052-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; the commission attempted to see if Veciana could identify Phillips as being "Bishop". Veciana insisted that he was not the same person and moreover that he had never met Phillips before either. Some committee members (and also lead investigator [[Gaeton Fonzi]]) doubted Veciana, reasoning that he should have at least recognized Phillips, a high-profile officer so heavily involved in Cuban operations.&lt;ref&gt;[[United States House Select Committee on Assassinations]] (1979), [https://www.archives.gov/research/jfk/select-committee-report/ HSCA Report], page 136, [[footnote]] 23&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Fonzi, Gaeton.

New York: Atheneum, 1977 (113).&lt;/ref&gt;   

In 2014, at a conference named ''The Warren Report and the JFK Assassination: Five Decades of Significant Disclosures'', Veciana reversed his previous statements, asserting unequivocally that he believed that the agent he knew as Bishop had in fact been David Atlee Phillips.&lt;ref&gt;[http://aarclibrary.org/antonio-veciana-admissions-and-revelations The Warren Report and the JFK Assassination: Five Decades of Significant Disclosures]{{cite AV media | people=Antonio Veciana | date=September 26, 2014 | title=Antonio Veciana - Admissions and Revelations | trans-title = | medium=Conference | location=Bethesda Hyatt Regency, Bethesda, Maryland| publisher=Assassination Archives and Research Center}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.independent.co.uk/news/long_reads/john-f-kennedy-assasination-cuba-cia-lee-harvey-oswald-antonio-veciana-a7957481.html JFK files: As Donald Trump looks to release classified documents, last living link to assassination drops bombshell], The Independent, 23 October 2017.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Later life==
Phillips wrote and lectured frequently on intelligence matters. He authored five books, including his CIA [[memoir]] ''The Night Watch'', ''Careers in Secret Operations: How to Be a Federal Intelligence Officer'', ''The Terror Brigade,'' ''The Carlos Contract,'' and ''The Great Texas Murder Trials: A Compelling Account of the Sensational [[T. Cullen Davis]] Case.''

Phillips died at his home in [[Bethesda, Maryland]] from complications of cancer on July 7, 1988; at the age of 65.&lt;ref name="The New York Times; July 10, 1988"/&gt;

==Background==
Ernest Sands was born in [[Pincher Creek]], [[Alberta]] and his parents were [[United States citizen]]s which made him a United States citizen. In 1930, Sands and his family moved to [[Minot, North Dakota]]. He graduated from Minot High School and then went to Minot State Teachers College (now [[Minot State University]]). Sands served in the [[United States Army Air Force]] during [[World War II]] as a Bombardier for the 458th Bomb Group, 755th Squadron (B-24). On October 14, 1944, his plane was shot down over [[Cologne]], [[Germany]] and he was able to evade capture for several days. He was eventually captured and spent the rest of the war in Stalag Luft III and Stalag VIIA until he was repatriated by Patton's forces on April 29, 1945. In 1946, Sands received his degree in business administration from the [[University of North Dakota]]. Sands and his wife moved to [[Velva, North Dakota]] where he owned a funeral home, furniture and hardware businesses. In 1960, he served on the Velva City Council and in 1962 was the mayor of Velva, North Dakota. In 1967, he served in the North Dakota Senate and then Lieutenant Governor of North Dakota 1981–1985. He died in Minot, North Dakota.&lt;ref&gt;'Ernest Sands,' '''Bismarck Tribune (North Dakota),' April 13, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

An '''exhibition''', in the most general sense, is an organised presentation and display of a selection of items. In practice, exhibitions usually occur within a cultural or educational setting such as a [[museum]], [[art gallery]], [[park]], [[library]], [[exhibition hall]], or [[World's fair]]s.  Exhibitions can include many things such as art in both major museums and smaller galleries, interpretive exhibitions, natural history museums and history museums, and also varieties such as more commercially focused exhibitions and [[trade fair]]s.

In [[British English]] the word "exhibition" is used for a collection of items placed on display, and the event as a whole, which in [[American English]] is usually an "exhibit". In both varieties of English each object being shown within an exhibition is an "exhibit".

In common usage, "exhibitions" are considered temporary and usually scheduled to open and close on specific dates. While many exhibitions are shown in just one venue, some exhibitions are shown in multiple locations and are called [[travelling exhibition]]s, and some are [[online exhibition]]s.  Exhibitions featuring especially fragile or valuable objects, or live animals—may be shown only during a formal [[presentation]], under the close supervision of attendant or educator. Temporary exhibits that are transported from institution to institution are [[traveling exhibit]]s.

Though exhibitions are common events, the concept of an exhibition is quite wide and encompasses many variables. Exhibitions range from an extraordinarily large event such as a [[World's fair]] exposition to small one-artist [[Solo exhibition|solo show]]s or a display of just one item. [[Curator]]s are sometimes involved as the people who select the items in an exhibition. Writers and editors are sometimes needed to write text, labels and accompanying printed material such as catalogs and books. Architects, [[exhibition designer]]s, [[graphic designers]] and other designers may be needed to shape the exhibition space and give form to the editorial content. Organizing and holding exhibitions also requires effective [[event planning]], [[Event management|management]], and logistics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.transport-bbhandel.de/en/fairs-and-event-logistics/blog/exhibition-and-event-logistics-all-from-a-single-source|title=Exhibition and Event Logistics|last=Bartsch|first=Frank|date=31 May 2013|publisher=BB Handel|accessdate=5 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Salon du Louvre 1787.jpg|thumb|The [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] of 1787, held at the [[Louvre]]]]
The exhibition came fully into its own in the 19th century, but various temporary exhibitions had been held before that, especially the regular displays of mostly new art in major cities.  The [[Salon (Paris)|Paris Salon]] of the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]] was the most famous of these, beginning in 1667, and open to the public from 1737.  By the mid-18th century this and its equivalents in other countries had become crucial for developing and maintaining the reputation of contemporary artists.  In London the [[Royal Academy Summer Exhibition]] has been held annually since 1769, and the [[British Institution]] ran temporary exhibitions from 1805 to 1867, typically twice a year, with one of new British painting and one of loans of [[old masters]] from the [[Royal Collection]] and the aristocratic collections of [[English country house]]s.  

By the mid-19th century many of the new national museums of Europe were in place, and holding exhibitions of their own collections, or loaned collections, or a mixture of objects from both sourcers, which remains a typical mix today.  The "Chronology of Temporary Exhibitions at the [[British Museum]]" goes back to 1838.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/pdf/RP_Exhibitions_Chronology.pdf British Museum Research Publication no. 189], "Chronology of Temporary Exhibitions at the British Museum", PDF&lt;/ref&gt;  

The tradition of the [[Universal exposition]] "world Expo" or "World's Fair" began with the [[Great Exhibition]] of 1851 in London; these are only held every few years, most recently in [[Expo 2015|2015 in Milan]] and [[Expo 2017|2017 in Astana, Kazakhstan]]. The [[Eiffel Tower]] in Paris was built for the [[Exposition Universelle (1889)]] and served as an entrance arch.

Modern exhibitions may be concerned with preservation, education and demonstration, early exhibitions were designed to attract public interest and curiosity. Before the widespread adoption of [[photography]], the exhibition of a single object could attract large crowds.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Mondello|first=Bob|title=A History Of Museums, 'The Memory Of Mankind'|url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=97377145|accessdate=14 August 2013|newspaper=NPR|date=24 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Visitors might even be overcome with [[Stendhal syndrome]], feeling dizzy or overwhelmed by the intense sensory experience of an exhibit.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Squires|first=Nick|title=Scientists investigate Stendhal Syndrome – fainting caused by great art|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/7914746/Scientists-investigate-Stendhal-Syndrome-fainting-caused-by-great-art.html|accessdate=14 August 2013|newspaper=The Telegraph|date=28 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Today, there is still tension between the design of exhibits for educational purposes or for the purpose of attracting and entertaining an audience, as a [[tourist attraction]].

==Art exhibitions==
[[Image:Tate.modern.interior.london.arp.jpg|thumb|Fine art exhibited]]
{{Main|Art exhibition}}

Art exhibitions include an array of artifacts from countless forms of human making: paintings, drawings, [[craft]]s, sculpture, [[video installation]]s, [[sound installation]]s, performances, [[interactive art]], etc. Art exhibitions may focus on one artist, one group, one genre, one theme or one collection; or may be organized by curators, selected by juries, or show any artwork submitted.

Fine arts exhibitions typically highlight works of art with generous space and lighting, supplying information through labels or audioguides designed to be unobtrusive to the art itself.

Exhibitions may occur in series or periodically, as in the case with [[wikt:biennale|Biennale]]s, triennials and quadrennials. The first art exhibition to be called a blockbuster was allegedly the 1960 [[Picasso]] show at Tate in London.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.museumbookstore.com/blogs/blog/the-worlds-first-art-blockbuster Museum Bookstore]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretive exhibitions==
Interpretive exhibitions are exhibitions that require more context to explain the items being displayed. This is generally true of exhibitions devoted to scientific and historical themes, where text, [[diorama]]s, [[chart]]s, [[map]]s and interactive displays may provide necessary explanation of background and concepts. Interpretive exhibitions generally require more text and more graphics than fine art exhibitions do.

==Commercial exhibitions==

{{Main|Trade fair}}

Commercial exhibitions, generally called [[trade fair]]s, [[trade show]]s or expos, are usually organized so that organizations in a specific interest or industry can showcase and demonstrate their latest products, service, study activities of rivals and examine recent trends and opportunities. Some trade fairs are open to the public, while others can only be attended by company representatives (members of the trade) and members of the press.

==Digital exhibitions==
Changes in scholarly communication and the rise of the Internet have led to the creation of [[online exhibition]]s or digital exhibitions. These can include the digital viewing of physical exhibits; video tours of museums, art galleries and other cultural venues; and/or online exhibitions of "[[Born-digital|born digital]]" art, models or educational tools. The integration of information technology into museums and archives has also created opportunities for interactive and multimedia experiences inside cultural institutions. Many museums and galleries have extensive online resources that complement or enhance their physical exhibits. For example, in 2009, "[http://hcl.harvard.edu/libraries/houghton/exhibits/longfellow/ Public Poet, Private Man]," an online exhibit on the work of [[Henry Wadsworth Longfellow]], was recognized as an outstanding digital exhibit by the [[Association of College and Research Libraries]] (ARCL).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Reuell|first=Peter|title=Longfellow online exhibition recognized by ACRL|url=http://news.harvard.edu/gazette/story/2009/09/longfellow-online-exhibition-recognized-by-acrl/|accessdate=14 August 2013|newspaper=Harvard Gazette|date=15 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''TSB Festival of Lights''' is an annual event held in [[Pukekura Park]], [[New Plymouth]].  Running for free every year from mid-December to early February, it has daytime and night time programmes of events for people of all ages, and the festival itself transforms the park into an illuminated wonderland every evening.

Colourful lights are used to highlight tree crowns, ferns, and other plants.  Light art displays are installed along the festival walking route and the waterfall is lit in changing colors.

'''Gulal''' (गुलाल), also known as '''Abeer''' (अबीर), is the traditional name given to the coloured powders used for the typical [[Hindu]] rituals, in particular for the [[Holi festival]] (though commonly associated with the pink color used in the festival). During this festival, which celebrates love and equality, people throw these powder solutions at each other while singing and dancing.

==Origins==
[[File:Krishna N Radha.jpg|thumb|Krishna and Radha]]
A legend narrates that Lord [[Krishna]] complained to his mother about the darkness of his skin compared to that of his consort [[Radha]]. As a result, Krishna’s mother smeared colours onto Radha’s face. This explains why today Holi is celebrated by throwing colours on people.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/4497062 Ayygari, S., “Audio recording review”], in University of Texas Press, Summer - Autumn, 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

==Composition==

===From natural to chemical===
In earlier times, Gulal powders were prepared from flowers coming from trees, such as the [[Indian Coral Tree]] and the [[Flame of the Forest]], that had medicinal properties, beneficial to the skin. After the advent of [[synthetic dyes]] in the middle of 19th century, the disappearance of trees in urban areas and the pursuit of higher profits led to the abandonment of natural colours.&lt;ref name="Colour of ecofriendly dyes used in Holi rather than triphenyl methane dyes"&gt;[http://isindexing.com/isi/papers/1416219435.pdf Chaudhary H.H, Patel A.K., Patel K.S., Sen D.J., "Colour of ecofriendly dyes used in Holi rather than triphenyl methane dyes"], in ''World Journal of Pharmacy and Pharmaceutical Sciences'',  Vol. 3, Issue 9, 2014&lt;/ref&gt;
The new industrial dyes have been manufactured through chemical processes with non-standard parameters and hence the resulting colours are sometimes toxic for face and skin, causing problems such as eye irritation, allergies, skin infection and asthma.&lt;ref name="Natural dye-based Herbal Gulal"&gt;[http://14.139.47.15/handle/123456789/12322 Kapoor, V.P. and Pushpangadan, P., "Natural dye-based Herbal Gulal"], in ''Natural Product Radiance'', 2002 pp. 8-14,&lt;/ref&gt; Unsafe products have often been sold on the road by small traders, in boxes with labels saying "for industrial use only".

===Recent production from natural sources===
[[File:Indigofera tinctoria1.jpg|thumb|Indigofera tinctoria|alt=Indigofera tinctoria.jpg]]
Recently, the various harmful effects and concerns for the environment (synthetic powders caused temporary wastewater pollution too) generated awareness and encouraged people to celebrate an eco-friendly Holi. For the preparation of Herbal Gulal, lots of safe dyes can be used, such as [[Turmeric]] (Curcuma Longa), [[Indigo]] (Indigofera) or [[Annatto]] (Bixa Orellana), which are all ingredients easily available on the market at moderate prices. For these reasons, it is also possible to prepare Gulal at home, as suggested by many websites on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.quora.com/What-are-the-colors-used-in-Holi-made-of&lt;/ref&gt;

In the new natural processes to make Herbal Gulal, no salts of any heavy metal have been used and the combination of ingredients provides a powder having soft and supple touch with good sticking capacities to skin. The production profile of dry colour composition is eco-friendly as no toxic ingredients are released under the preparation. In this way, it has been possible to replace synthetic colours with natural ones. Herbal Gulal can be manufactured at higher scale and people who were scared about synthetic powders can now enjoy rituals with no restrictions.{{cn|date=March 2017}}

==Uses==
===Religious and cultural uses===
Gulal powder has always had an important role in [[Hindu]] culture and has always been used for religious purposes. 
Besides [[Holi festival]], the use of coloured powders appears in other ceremonies, such as funerals. In this case, in some populations, a particular ritual occurs when the deceased is a married man. The widow puts on all the ornaments she possesses and takes leave of her husband adorning him with all her jewels. Holding a small brass plate with coloured powders, she lets the men participating at the ceremony paint the face of the deceased. This ritual is associated with the one of marriage, in which the bridegroom and the bride anoint themselves with coloured powders for four days before the wedding. This ointment, indeed, is meant to prepare their bodies for conjugal life.
&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.jstor.org/stable/3316180 Fuchs, S., “The funeral rites of the Nimar Balahis” ], in George Washington University Institute for Ethnographic Research, 1940, Vol. 13, pp. 49-79&lt;/ref&gt; Beyond the religious sphere, the consumption of Gulal powder is spread for different uses.

===Scientific uses===
One interesting use of this powder has been developed in the field of latent [[fingerprint]]s. A study by [[Punjabi University]] of Patiala shows that the application of Gulal or food colours to latent fingerprints can give clear results.  During this study, few grams of dry colours were taken and sprinkled over different surfaces, such as normal paper, top of CDs, aluminium foil, and aluminium sheet. It has been concluded that commonly and easily available agents are a useful substitute for the decipherment of latent prints.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S2090536X11000372 Garg R.K., Kaur R., Kumari H., “New visualizing agents for latent fingerprints: Synthetic food and festival colors” ], in Egyptian Journal of Forensic Sciences, 2011, Vol. 1, Issues 3-4, pp. 133-139&lt;/ref&gt;

===Other uses and westernization===
[[File:A celebration of Holi Festival of Colors, Utah United States 2013.jpg|thumb|A celebration of Holi Festival in the United States.]]
{{POV|date=June 2016}}
Gulal consumption related to Holi festival has been taken out from the Hindu context and desacralized. The [[desacralization]] consists in a distortion of the original meaning of the cultural elements at the base of the Holi ceremony, which has often suffered from a disrespectful treatment.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Indeed, in the contemporary Western society, Holi festival has become a phenomenon of consumerism, with no longer religious aspects.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Throwing Gulal powder has become something cool and fashionable: everybody can buy this powder online and use it to give to its own party an extra point.

The main reason why Holi is now so well known outside the Asian continent is the birth of many Holi remakes for commercial purposes.  From the beginning of the 2000s, Europeans, Americans, and Australians started to follow the trend of going to parties that involved throwing coloured powders at each other, in a relaxed and peaceful atmosphere.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}} Best examples of these remakes are ‘[[Festival of colors]]’ and ‘[[The Color Run]]’. The latter one, also known as “The Happiest 5K on the Planet” and born in 2012, is a further alteration of the original festival, since it consists in a five kilometre paint race. 
[[File:The Color Run, Grand Prix Edition (Melbourne 2014) (12869502993).jpg|thumb|The Color Run, Grand Prix Edition (Melbourne 2014)]]
This desacralization led to criticisms by natives, because of the over-simplification of one of their most meaningful religious rituals. Moreover, they bemoan the misuse of Holi, the fact that their culture has been profited off, the sexualisation coming from a very inappropriate outfit and the devaluation on [[social networks]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.browngirlmagazine.com/2013/04/color-run-controversy/ Agrawal, N., "Dye-ing Culture: Color Run, White-washing Holi Since 2012"], 2013&lt;/ref&gt; Participants to Holi festival remakes, indeed, generally share their coloured pictures on [[Facebook]] or [[Twitter]], using [[hashtags]] which can remind of the original meaning of the celebration, but that paradoxically blurs it more and more.{{Citation needed|date=June 2016}}

==Curiosities==
Indian manufacturers of Holi colours are facing huge losses as Chinese alternatives are selling a lot. A survey reported that Chinese products are more innovative and cheaper by up to 55%, comparing to powders manufactured locally in regions like Uttar Pradesh, Rajastan, Madhya Pradesh and Gujarat. The invasion of innovative and fancy Chinese products, despite the central government effort to promote ‘Made in India’, is making survival difficult for small manufacturer, most of whom have been engaged in this business for decades .&lt;ref&gt;[http://timesofindia.indiatimes.com/business/india-business/No-takers-for-local-gulal-as-Chinese-products-flood-market/articleshow/51514737.cms/  “This Holi, no takers for local gulal as Chinese products flood market”], in The Times of India, 2016&lt;/ref&gt;
Coldplay’s video ‘Hymn for the weekend’ has been filmed in Mumbai during the Holi festival, using Gulal powder as a central feature. The band has been accused of cultural appropriation.

[[Image:Spb 06-2012 Palace Embankment various 12.jpg|thumb|300px|Hemitage Theatre on the [[Palace Embankment]] of [[Neva River]]]]
The '''Hermitage Theatre''' ({{lang-rus|'''Эрмитажный Театр'''|Èrmitážnyj Teátr|ɪrʲmʲɪˈtaʐnɨj tʲɪˈatər}}) in [[Saint Petersburg]], [[Russia]] is one of five [[Hermitage Museum|Hermitage]] buildings lining the [[Palace Embankment]] of the [[Neva River]].

The Hermitage Theatre was the second theatre of the Winter Palace. It replaced the [[Russian Imperial Theater]], which operated from 1764 until 1783. The Hermitage Theatre was built between 1783 and 1787 at the behest of [[Catherine the Great]] to a [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]]{{cn|date=January 2016}} design by [[Giacomo Quarenghi]]. The crumbling Third Winter Palace of [[Peter I of Russia|Peter the Great]] was demolished to make room for the new structure, although its old foundations are still visible in the ground floor. Quarenghi's designs for the theatre were engraved and published in 1787, earning him a European reputation.

The semicircular [[auditorium]] is decorated with color marble and surrounded with ten niches for statues of [[Apollo]] and the [[muse]]s. As the interior has never been overhauled, the original [[stage machinery]] remains [[in situ]], but the elaborate sets, an acclaimed work of the [[Italy|Italian]] artist [[Pietro Gonzaga]] (1751-1831), were lost during the years of Soviet neglect. 
[[Image:Ermitazhteatr.jpg|thumb|left|199px|&lt;center&gt;[[Hermitage Bridge]] in front of the theatre&lt;/center&gt;]] 

The ceremonial opening of the theatre took place on 22 November 1785. Though the auditorium could seat no more than 250 spectators, it was often overcrowded. Usually, the performance would be attended by several dozen aristocratic spectators, all invited by the monarch herself. As a sign of gratitude, a separate loge was reserved for the architect Quarenghi and his family. In the 19th century, selected members of the diplomatic corps were admitted to the theatre as well.

Although the building was used to entertain the imperial family until the [[Russian Revolution of 1917|Russian Revolution]], it came to be viewed as a rare monument to Catherine's personal tastes and affections. The empress brought out several comedies specifically to be staged in this theatre, which also saw the premieres of [[Domenico Cimarosa]]'s operas composed to her own [[libretto]]s. As for the costumes, they were chosen from a 15,000-dress personal [[wardrobe (clothing)|wardrobe]] of the late [[Elizabeth of Russia|Empress Elizabeth]].

[[Mathilde Kschessinska]], [[Anna Pavlova]], and [[Fyodor Chaliapin]] were among the great artists who performed at the Hermitage Theatre for the [[Nicholas II of Russia|last Russian tsar]]. Among the ballets performed there was the premiere of [[Marius Petipa]]'s ''[[Harlequinade (ballet)|Harlequinade]]'', in 1900. The [[Bolsheviks]] closed the theatre and utilised the building for administrative purposes. It was not until 1991 that performances were resumed on this stage, with the likes of [[Svyatoslav Richter]], [[Mstislav Rostropovich]] and [[Yelena Obraztsova]] appearing as guest stars.

'''Infierno en el Ring (2012)''' ([[Spanish language|Spanish]] for "Inferno in the Ring") was an annual [[professional wrestling]] major event produced by [[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]] (CMLL), which took place on June 29, 2012 in [[Arena México]], [[Mexico City, Mexico]]. The 2012 ''Infierno en el Ring'' replaced CMLL's regularly scheduled Friday night [[CMLL Super Viernes|Super Viernes]] show. The 2012 Infierno en el Ring was the fourth show under that name, the 14th time CMLL have promoted an ''Infierno en el Ring'' cage match and the first time it featured women competing in the main event.&lt;ref name=Preview&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2012/06/28/sin-tregua-las-amazonas-del-ring-en-el-infierno | title= Sin tregua las Amazonas del ring en el Infierno | author= Redacción Mediotiempo | date=June 28, 2012 | accessdate=October 3, 2012 | work=Medio Tiempo | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt; The main event of the show was the eponymous ''Infierno en el Ring'' match that CMLL traditionally has traditionally held approximately once a year and which has headlined its own specific show since 2008. The ''Infierno en el Ring'' match is a multi-person [[Professional wrestling match types#Cages|Steel Cage]] match contested under ''[[Lucha de Apuestas]]'', or bet match, rules which means that the loser of the match would be forced to unmask or have their hair shaved off per Lucha Libre traditions. At the 2012 event 10 women participated, risking either their mask, ([[La Seductora]] and  [[Goya Kong]]) or their hair ([[La Amapola]], [[Estrellita (wrestler)|Estrellita]], [[Sarah Stock|Dark Angel]], [[Lady Apache]], [[Tiffany (luchadora)|Tiffany]], [[Marcela (wrestler)|Marcela]], [[Dalys la Caribeña]] and  [[Princesa Blanca]]).&lt;ref name=Infierno&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.mediotiempo.com/mas-deportes/lucha-libre/noticias/2012/06/21/infierno-en-el-ring-para-las-amazonas-del-cmll | title= Infierno en el Ring para las Amazonas del CMLL | author= Redacción Mediotiempo | date=June 21, 2012 | accessdate=October 3, 2012 | work=Medio Tiempo | language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The show featured an additional five matches, three [[Professional wrestling tag team match types#Trios rules (Relevos Australianos)|Best two-out-of-three falls six-man tag team matches]], a [[Tag Team]] match and a ''Lightning match'', a one fall match with a 10-minute time limit.

==Production==
===Background===
The Mexican [[wrestling promotion|wrestling company]] ''[[Consejo Mundial de Lucha Libre]]'' (Spanish for "World Wrestling Council"; CMLL) has held a number of major shows over the years using the moniker ''Infierno en el Ring'' ("Inferno in the Ring"), all of which were main evented by a multi-man [[steel cage match]], the eponymous ''Infierno en el Ring'' match. CMLL has use the ''Infierno en el Ring'' match on other shows, but will intermittently hold a show billed specifically as ''Infierno en el Ring'', with the first such show held in 2008. It is not an annually recurring show, but instead held intermittently sometimes several years apart and not always in the same month of the year either. All ''Infierno en el Ring'' shows have been held in [[Arena México]] in [[Mexico City, Mexico]] which is CMLL's main venue, its "home".&lt;ref name=Mondo&gt;{{cite book|author=Madigan, Dan|title=Mondo Lucha A Go-Go: the bizarre &amp; honorable world of wild Mexican wrestling|publisher=HarperColins Publisher|year=2007|chapter=El nacimient de un sueño (the birth of a dream)|pages=41–50|isbn=978-0-06-085583-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally CMLL holds their major events on Friday Nights, which means the ''Infierno en el Ring'' '' shows replace their regularly scheduled ''[[CMLL Super Viernes|Super Viernes]]'' show.&lt;ref name=Mondo/&gt; The 2012 ''Infierno en el Ring'' show was the fourth show to use the name.

===Storylines===
The event featured six [[Professional wrestling match types|professional wrestling matches]] with different wrestlers involved in pre-existing [[Screenplay|scripted]] feuds, [[plot (narrative)|plots]] and [[narrative thread|storylines]]. Wrestlers were portrayed as either [[Heel (professional wrestling)|heels]] (referred to as ''rudos'' in Mexico, those that portray the "bad guys") or [[Face (professional wrestling)|faces]] (''técnicos'' in Mexico, the "good guy" characters) as they followed a series of tension-building events, which culminated in a wrestling match or series of matches.

{{Use dmy dates|date=September 2013}}[[File:Iron Curtain map.svg|thumb|The Iron Curtain depicted as a black line. [[Warsaw Pact]] countries on one side of the Iron Curtain appear shaded red; [[NATO]] members on the other shaded blue; militarily neutral countries shaded gray. The black dot represents [[West Berlin]]. [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia|Yugoslavia]], although communist-ruled, remained largely independent of the two major blocs and is shaded green. [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania|Communist Albania]] broke off contacts with the [[Soviet Union]] in the early 1960s, aligning itself with the [[People's Republic of China]] after the [[Sino-Soviet split]]; it appears stripe-hatched with grey.]]

The '''Iron Curtain''' was the name for the boundary dividing [[Europe]] into two separate areas from the end of [[World War II]] in 1945 until the end of the [[Cold War]] in 1989. The term symbolizes the efforts by the [[Soviet Union]] to block itself and its [[satellite state]]s from open contact with [[Western Bloc|the West]] and its allied states. On the east side of the Iron Curtain were the countries that were connected to or influenced by the Soviet Union, while on the west side were the countries that were allied to the United States or nominally neutral. Separate international economic and military alliances were developed on each side of the Iron Curtain: 

* Member countries of the [[Comecon|Council for Mutual Economic Assistance]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]], with the Soviet Union as the [[hegemon|leading state]]
* Member countries of the [[NATO|North Atlantic Treaty Organization]] (NATO) and with the [[United States]] as the pre-eminent power

Physically, the Iron Curtain took the form of border defences between the countries of Europe in the middle of the continent. The most notable border was marked by the [[Berlin Wall]] and its [[Checkpoint Charlie]], which served as a symbol of the Curtain as a whole.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,959058,00.html | work= Time | title= Archive: Freedom!

The use of the term ''iron curtain'' as a metaphor for strict separation goes back at least as far as the early 19th century. It originally referred to fireproof curtains in theaters.&lt;ref name="Feuerlicht"/&gt; Although its popularity as a Cold War symbol is attributed to its use in a speech [[Winston Churchill]] gave on the 5 March 1946 in [[Fulton, Missouri|Fulton]], [[Missouri]],&lt;ref name="Feuerlicht"/&gt; German Minister of Propaganda [[Joseph Goebbels]] had already used the term in reference to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

==Pre–Cold War usage==
[[File:Bakom Rysslands jarnrid.jpg|thumb|Swedish book "''Behind Russia's iron curtain''" from 1923]]

Various usages of the term "iron curtain" ({{lang-ru |link=no|Железный занавес Zheleznyj zanaves}}; {{lang-de |link=no|Eiserner Vorhang}}; {{lang-ka|link=no|რკინის ფარდა Rkinis pharda}}; [[Czech language |Czech]] and [[Slovak language|Slovak]]: Železná opona; {{lang-hu |Vasfüggöny}}; {{lang-ro|Cortina de fier}}; {{lang-it |Cortina di ferro}}; {{lang-sr|Гвоздена завеса Gvozdena zavesa}}; {{lang-et |Raudne eesriie}}; {{lang-bg|Желязна завеса Zhelyazna zavesä}}) pre-date Churchill's use of the phrase. The concept goes back to the [[Babylonian Talmud]] of the 3rd to 5th centuries CE, where Tractate Sota 38b refers to a "mechitza shel barzel", an iron barrier or divider: "אפילו מחיצה של ברזל אינה מפסקת בין ישראל לאביהם שבשמים" (Even an iron barrier cannot separate [the people of] Israel from their heavenly father).

The term "iron curtain" has since been used metaphorically in two rather different senses – firstly to denote the end of an era and secondly to denote a closed geopolitical border.  The source of these metaphors can refer to either the [[safety curtain]] deployed in theatres (the first one was installed by the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] in 1794&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.theatrestrust.org.uk/resources/exploring-theatres/history-of-theatres/eighteenth-century-theatre |title=Eighteenth-century theatre | work = History of theatres - Exploring Theatres |publisher= The Theatres Trust |accessdate=16 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;) or to [[roller shutter]]s used to secure commercial premises.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last= Proust|first= Marcel|title= The Captive |translator-last= Scott Moncrieff|translator-first=C.K. |year= 1929}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first metaphorical usage of "iron curtain", in the sense of an end of an era, perhaps should be attributed to British author [[Arthur Machen]] (1863–1947), who used the term in his 1895 novel ''The Three Impostors'': "...the door clanged behind me with the noise of thunder, and I felt that an iron curtain had fallen on the brief passage of my life".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Machen |first= Arthur |title=The Three Impostors |publisher= Aegypan Press |location= Los Angeles(?) |year=2005 |page= 60 |isbn= 1-59818-437-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The English translation of a Russian text shown immediately below repeats the use of "clang" with reference to an "iron curtain", suggesting that the Russian writer, publishing 23 years after Machen, may have been familiar with the popular British author.

[[Queen Elisabeth of the Belgians]] used the term "Iron Curtain" in the context of World War I to describe the political situation between [[Belgium]] and Germany in 1914.&lt;ref&gt;Queen Elisabeth of the Belgians to Pierre Loti in 1915 ({{citation |first= Pierre |last= Loti |title= L'Album de la Guerre |edition=L'Illustration |location= Paris |year=1923 |page= 33}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

The first recorded application of the term to Communist Russia, again in the sense of the end of an era, comes in [[Vasily Rozanov]]'s 1918 polemic ''[[The Apocalypse of Our Times]]'', and it is possible that Churchill read it there following the publication of the book's English translation in 1920. The passage runs:
{{Quote |With clanging, creaking, and squeaking, an iron curtain is lowering over Russian History. "The performance is over." The audience got up. "Time to put on your fur coats and go home." We looked around, but the fur coats and homes were missing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last =Rozanov | first =Vasily| title = The Apocalypse of our Times ("Апокалипсис нашего времени") | publisher =  | year =1918  | location =103| page =212}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

(Incidentally, this same passage provides a definition of [[nihilism]] adopted by [[Raoul Vaneigem]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last = Vaneigem | first = Raoul| title =The Revolution of Everyday Life ("Traité de savoir-vivre à l'usage des jeunes générations")  | publisher = Red and Black | year =1967 | location = 176 | page = 279 | isbn =  }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Guy Debord]] and other [[Situationist International |Situationists]] as the intention of situationist intervention.)

The first English-language use of the term ''[[iron (metaphor) |iron]] [[curtain]]'' applied to the border of communist Russia in the sense of "an impenetrable barrier" was used in 1920 by [[Ethel Snowden]], in her book ''Through Bolshevik Russia''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last1 = Cohen |first1 =J.

J. |last2 = Cohen |year= 1996 |title=New Penguin Dictionary of Quotations  |publisher=Penguin Books |page=726 |isbn = 0-14-051244-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Snowden |first=Philip (Ethel) |title=Through Bolshevik Russia |location= London |publisher=Cassell |year=1920 | URL = https://books.google.com/books?id=JRJLAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAMAAJ | page = 32}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[G.K. Chesterton]] used the phrase in a 1924 essay in ''[[The Illustrated London News]]''. Chesterton, while defending [[Distributism]], refers to "that '''iron curtain''' of [[industrialism]] that has cut us off not only from our neighbours' condition, but even from our own past".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |last= Chesterton |first=G.K. |title= The Collected Works of G.K. Chesterton: The Illustrated London News 1923 – 1925 |publisher= Ignatius Press |year= 1990 |page=452 |isbn= 0-89870-274-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term also appears in the 1933 satirical novel ''[[England, Their England]]''; used there to describe the way an artillery barrage protected the infantry from an enemy assault: "...the western sky was a blaze of yellow flame. The iron curtain was down". [[Sebastian Haffner]] used the metaphor in his book ''Germany: Jekyll &amp; Hyde'', published in London in 1940, in introducing his discussion of the Nazi rise to power in Germany in 1933: "Back then to March 1933. How, a moment before the iron curtain was wrung down on it, did the German political stage appear?"&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Haffner |first= Sebastian |year=2008 |title=Germany: Jekyll &amp; Hyde: A contemporary account of Nazi Germany |isbn=978-0-349-11889-5 |location=London |publisher= Abacus |page= 177}}&lt;/ref&gt;

All German theatres{{when|date=August 2014}} had to install an iron curtain (''eiserner Vorhang'') as an obligatory precaution to prevent the possibility of fire spreading from the stage to the rest of the theatre. Such fires were rather common because the decor often was very flammable. In case of fire, a metal wall would separate the stage from the theatre, secluding the flames to be extinguished by firefighters. [[Douglas Reed]] used this metaphor in his book ''Disgrace Abounding'': "The bitter strife [in Yugoslavia between Serb unionists and Croat federalists] had only been hidden by the iron safety-curtain of the King's dictatorship".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last= Reed |first=Douglas |authorlink=Douglas Reed |title= Disgrace Abounding |publisher=Jonathan Cape |year=1939 |page= 129}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A May 1943 article in ''[[Signal (magazine)|Signal]]'', a Nazi illustrated propaganda periodical published in many languages, bore the title "Behind the Iron Curtain". It discussed "the iron curtain that more than ever before separates the world from the Soviet Union".&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{citation |title= Hinter dem eisernen Vorhang |newspaper= Signal |number= 9 |date= May 1943 |language= de |page= 2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The German [[Ministry of Public Enlightenment and Propaganda |Minister of Propaganda]] [[Joseph Goebbels]] wrote in his weekly newspaper ''[[Das Reich (newspaper)|Das Reich]]'' that if the Nazis should lose the war a Soviet-formed "iron curtain" would arise because of agreements made by [[Joseph Stalin |Stalin]], [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]] and Winston Churchill at the [[Yalta Conference]]: "An iron curtain would fall over this enormous territory controlled by the Soviet Union, behind which nations would be slaughtered".&lt;ref name= Feuerlicht&gt;{{citation |title=A New Look at the Iron Curtain |first= Ignace |last=Feuerlicht |journal= American Speech |volume= 30 |issue= 3 |date=October 1955 |pages=186–189 |doi=10.2307/453937 |jstor= 453937}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Goebbels |first= Joseph |url= http://www.calvin.edu/academic/cas/gpa/goeb49.htm |title= Das Jahr 2000 |newspaper=Das Reich |language= de |date= 25 February 1945 |pages= 1–2}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The first recorded oral intentional mention of an Iron Curtain in the Soviet context occurred in a broadcast by [[Lutz Graf Schwerin von Krosigk|Lutz von Krosigk]] to the German people on 2 May 1945: "In the East the iron curtain behind which, unseen by the eyes of the world, the work of destruction goes on, is moving steadily forward".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title= Krosigk's Cry of Woe |newspaper= The Times |date=3 May 1945 |page= 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchill's first recorded use of the term "iron curtain" came in a 12 May 1945 telegram he sent to U.S. President [[Harry S. Truman]] regarding his concern about Soviet actions, stating "[a]n iron curtain is drawn down upon their front. We do not know what is going on behind".&lt;ref name=" maychurchill" /&gt; He was further concerned about "another immense flight of the German population westward as this enormous Muscovite advance towards the centre of Europe".&lt;ref name= "maychurchill"/&gt; Churchill concluded "then the curtain will descend again to a very large extent, if not entirely. Thus a broad land of many hundreds of miles of Russian-occupied territory will isolate us from Poland".&lt;ref name="maychurchill"&gt;{{Citation |last= Churchill |first= Winston S. |title= The Second World War, Triumph and Tragedy |publisher=Bantam |year=1962 |volume= 2 |chapter= 15 |pages= 489, 514}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation | publisher =US Dept of State |title= Foreign Relations of the US, The Conference of Berlin (Potsdam) |year=1945 |volume=1 |page= 9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchill repeated the words in a further telegram to President Truman on 4 June 1945, in which he protested against such a U.S. retreat to what was earlier designated as, and ultimately became, the U.S. occupation zone, saying the military withdrawal would bring "Soviet power into the heart of Western Europe and the descent of an iron curtain between us and everything to the eastward".{{sfn|Churchill |1962|p=92}} At the [[Potsdam Conference]], Churchill complained to Stalin about an "iron fence" coming down upon the British Mission in Bucharest.

The first American print reference to the "Iron Curtain" occurred when C.L. Sulzberger of ''The New York Times'' first used it in a dispatch published on 23 July 1945. He had heard the term used by [[Vladko Maček]], a [[Croatia]]n politician, a Yugoslav opposition leader who had fled his homeland for Paris in May 1945. Maček told Sulzberger, "During the four years while I was interned by the Germans in Croatia I saw how the Partisans were lowering an iron curtain over Jugoslavia [Yugoslavia] so that nobody could know what went on behind it".&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |last=Weintraub |first=Stanley |title= The Last Great Victory |publisher=Truman Talley Books |location= New York |year=1995 |page= 184}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term was first used in the British House of Commons by Churchill on 16 August 1945 when he stated "it is not impossible that tragedy on a prodigious scale is unfolding itself behind the iron curtain which at the moment divides Europe in twain".&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation |title= Debate on the address |publisher= Hansard, House of Commons |url= http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1945/aug/16/debate-on-the-address#column_84 |at= column 84 |date= 16 August 1945 |volume= 413}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Allen Dulles]] used the term in a speech on 3 December 1945, referring to only Germany, following his conclusion that "in general the Russians are acting little better than thugs", had "wiped out all the liquid assets", and refused to issue food cards to emigrating Germans, leaving them "often more dead than alive". Dulles concluded that "[a]n iron curtain has descended over the fate of these people and very likely conditions are truly terrible. The promises at Yalta to the contrary, probably 8 to 10 million people are being enslaved".{{citation needed|date=August 2014}}

===Building antagonism===

The antagonism between the Soviet Union and the West that came to be described as the "iron curtain" had various origins.

During the summer of 1939, after conducting negotiations both with a British-French group and with [[Nazi Germany]] regarding potential military and political agreements,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirer|1990|pp=515–40}}&lt;/ref&gt; the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany signed [[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)|the German–Soviet Commercial Agreement]] (which provided for the trade of certain German military and civilian equipment in exchange for Soviet raw materials)&lt;ref name="shirer668"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirer|1990|p=668}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name = "ericson57"&gt;{{Harvnb|Ericson|1999|p=57}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] (signed in late August 1939), named after the foreign secretaries of the two countries ([[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and [[Joachim von Ribbentrop]]), which included a secret agreement to split Poland and Eastern Europe between the two states.&lt;ref&gt;Day, Alan J.; East, Roger; Thomas, Richard. ''A Political and Economic Dictionary of Eastern Europe'', p. 405.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20080069304 |publisher=NDTV |title=Stalin offered troops to stop Hitler |location=London |agency=Press Trust of India |accessdate=4 March 2009 |date=19 October 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090317090544/http://www.ndtv.com/convergence/ndtv/story.aspx?id=NEWEN20080069304 |archivedate=17 March 2009 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Soviets thereafter occupied Eastern [[Poland]] (September 1939), [[Latvia]] (June 1940), [[Lithuania]] (1940), northern [[Romania]] ([[Bessarabia]] and [[Northern Bukovina]], late June 1940), [[Estonia]] (1940) and eastern [[Finland]] (March 1940). From August 1939, relations between the West and the Soviets deteriorated further when the Soviet Union and Nazi Germany engaged in an extensive [[Nazi–Soviet economic relations|economic relationship]] by which the Soviet Union sent Germany vital oil, rubber, manganese and other materials in exchange for German weapons, manufacturing machinery and technology.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Ericson|first=Edward E.|title=Feeding the German Eagle: Soviet Economic Aid to Nazi Germany, 1933 – 1941 |publisher=Greenwood Publishing Group |year=1999 |isbn=0-275-96337-3|pages=1–210}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|last=Shirer|first=William L.|title=The Rise and Fall of the Third Reich: A History of Nazi Germany|publisher=Simon and Schuster|year=1990 |isbn=0-671-72868-7|pages=598–610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nazi–Soviet trade ended in June 1941 when Germany broke the Pact and invaded the Soviet Union in [[Operation Barbarossa]].

In the course of World War II, Stalin determined{{Citation needed|date=December 2009}} to acquire a buffer area against Germany, with pro-Soviet states on its border in an [[Eastern bloc]]. Stalin's aims led to strained relations at the [[Yalta Conference]] (February 1945) and the subsequent [[Potsdam Conference]] (August 1945).&lt;ref&gt;
{{Citation |first=Gar |last=Alperovitz |title=Atomic Diplomacy: Hiroshima and Potsdam: The Use of the Atomic Bomb and the American Confrontation with Soviet Power|origyear=1965 |year=1985|publisher=Penguin|isbn=978-0-14-008337-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; People in the West expressed opposition to Soviet domination over the buffer states, and the fear grew that the Soviets were building an empire that might be a threat to them and their interests.

Nonetheless, at the [[Potsdam Conference]], the Allies assigned parts of Poland, Finland, Romania, Germany, and the Balkans to Soviet control or influence. In return, Stalin promised the Western Allies that he would allow those territories the right to [[Self-determination|national self-determination]]. Despite Soviet cooperation during the war, these concessions left many in the West uneasy. In particular, Churchill feared that the United States might return to its pre-war [[United States isolationism|isolationism]], leaving the exhausted European states unable to resist Soviet demands. (President Franklin D. Roosevelt had announced at Yalta that after the defeat of Germany, U.S. forces would withdraw from Europe within two years.)&lt;ref&gt;[[Antony Beevor]] ''Berlin: The building of the Berlin Wall'', p. 80&lt;/ref&gt;

===Iron Curtain speech===
{{Wikisource|Iron Curtain Speech}}

Winston Churchill's [[:s:Sinews of Peace|"Sinews of Peace" address]] of 5 March 1946, at [[Westminster College, Missouri|Westminster College]], used the term "iron curtain" in the context of Soviet-dominated Eastern Europe:

[[File:Iron Curtain as described by Churchill.PNG|thumb|The Iron Curtain as described by Churchill at Westminster College. Note that Vienna (''center red regions, 3rd down'') is indeed behind the Curtain, as it was in the Austrian [[Allied-occupied Austria|Soviet-occupied zone]].]]

&lt;blockquote&gt;From [[Szczecin|Stettin]] in the [[Baltic Sea|Baltic]] to [[Trieste]] in the [[Adriatic Sea|Adriatic]] an iron curtain has descended across the Continent. Behind that line lie all the capitals of the ancient states of Central and Eastern Europe. Warsaw, Berlin, Prague, Vienna, Budapest, Belgrade, Bucharest and Sofia; all these famous cities and the populations around them lie in what I must call the Soviet sphere, and all are subject, in one form or another, not only to Soviet influence but to a very high and in some cases increasing measure of control from Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Churchill|first1=Winston|title=The Sinews of Peace ('Iron Curtain Speech')|url=https://www.winstonchurchill.org/resources/speeches/1946-1963-elder-statesman/the-sinews-of-peace/|website=Winstonchurchill.org|publisher=[[International Churchill Society]]|accessdate=2 December 2017|date=5 March 1946}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Much of the Western public still regarded the [[Soviet Union]] as a close ally in the context of the recent defeat of [[Nazi Germany]] and of [[Empire of Japan|Imperial Japan]]. Although not well received at the time, the phrase ''iron curtain'' gained popularity as a shorthand reference to the division of Europe as the Cold War strengthened. The Iron Curtain served to keep people in and information out, and people throughout the West eventually came to accept and use the metaphor.&lt;ref&gt;Authors such as Lewkowicz have underlined the importance played by the treatment of the [[German Question]] in the division of the continent into two ideological camps. See: [https://www.amazon.com/dp/8895145275 ''The German Question and the Origins of the Cold War'']
&lt;/ref&gt;

Churchill's "Sinews of Peace" address was to strongly criticise the Soviet Union's exclusive and secretive tension policies along with the Eastern Europe's state form, [[Police State]] (''Polizeistaat''). He expressed the Allied Nations' distrust of the Soviet Union after the World War II.  In September that year, US-Soviet Union cooperation collapsed due to the US disavowal of the Soviet Union's opinion on the German problem in the [[Stuttgart Council]], and then followed the announcement by US President, Harry S. Truman, of a hard line anti-Soviet, anticommunist policy.  After that the phrase became more widely used as anti-Soviet term in the West.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=1146410&amp;cid=40942&amp;categoryId=31656 |title=철의 장막 : 지식백과 |language=ko |publisher=Terms.naver.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Churchill mentioned in his speech that regions under the Soviet Union's control were expanding their leverage and power without any restriction.  He asserted that in order to put a brake on this ongoing phenomenon, the commanding force of and strong unity between the UK and the US was necessary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://terms.naver.com/entry.nhn?docId=72578&amp;cid=504&amp;categoryId=504 |title=철의 장막 : 지식백과 |language=ko |publisher=Terms.naver.com |date= |accessdate=2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stalin took note of Churchill's speech and responded in ''[[Pravda]]'' soon afterward.  He accused Churchill of warmongering, and defended Soviet "friendship" with eastern European states as a necessary safeguard against another invasion. He further accused Churchill of hoping to install right-wing governments in eastern Europe with the goal of agitating those states against the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Stalin |url=http://www.marxists.org/reference/archive/stalin/works/1946/03/x01.htm |title=Interview to "Pravda" Correspondent Concerning Mr. Winston Churchill's Speech |publisher=Marxists.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-16}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Andrei Zhdanov]], Stalin's chief propagandist, used the term against the West in an August 1946 speech:&lt;ref&gt;http://www.revolutionarydemocracy.org/archive/zhdanovlit.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Block quote|Hard as bourgeois politicians and writers may strive to conceal the truth of the achievements of the Soviet order and Soviet culture, hard as they may strive to erect an iron curtain to keep the truth about the Soviet Union from penetrating abroad, hard as they may strive to belittle the genuine growth and scope of Soviet culture, all their efforts are foredoomed to failure.}}

===Political, economic and military realities===

====Eastern Bloc====
[[File:EasternBloc BasicMembersOnly.svg|thumb|A map of the [[Eastern Bloc]].]]
{{Main|Eastern Bloc}}

While the Iron Curtain remained in place, much of Eastern Europe and parts of Central Europe (except [[West Germany]], [[Liechtenstein]], [[Switzerland]] and [[Austria]]) found themselves under the hegemony of the [[Soviet Union]]. The Soviet Union annexed:

* [[Estonia]],&lt;ref name="wettig20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="senn" /&gt;
* [[Latvia]]&lt;ref name="wettig20"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="senn"&gt;Senn, Alfred Erich, ''Lithuania 1940: Revolution from Above'', Amsterdam, New York, Rodopi, 2007 {{ISBN|978-90-420-2225-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Lithuania]]&lt;ref name="wettig20" /&gt;&lt;ref name="senn" /&gt;
as [[Soviet Socialist Republics]] within the [[Union of Soviet Socialist Republics]].

Germany effectively gave Moscow a free hand in much of these territories in the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact]] of 1939, signed before Germany [[Operation Barbarossa|invaded the Soviet Union]] in 1941.

Other Soviet-annexed territories included:

* [[Kresy|Eastern Poland]] (incorporated into [[Territories of Poland annexed by the Soviet Union|Ukrainian and Byelorussian SSRs]]),&lt;ref name="stalinswars43"&gt;{{Harvnb| Roberts| 2006| p=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Part of eastern [[Finland]] (became part of the [[Karelo-Finnish SSR]])&lt;ref name="ckpipe"&gt;Kennedy-Pipe, Caroline, ''Stalin's Cold War'', New York: Manchester University Press, 1995, {{ISBN|0-7190-4201-1}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Northern [[Romania]] (part of which became the [[Moldavian SSR]]).&lt;ref name="stalinswars55"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2006|p=55}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="shirer794"&gt;{{Harvnb|Shirer|1990|p=794}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Kaliningrad Oblast]], the northern half of [[East Prussia]], taken in 1945.

Between 1945 and 1949 the Soviets converted the following areas into [[Satellite state|Soviet satellite]] states:

* The [[East Germany|German Democratic Republic]]&lt;ref name="wettig96"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wettig|2008|pp=96–100}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]]
* The [[People's Republic of Poland]]
* The [[Hungarian People's Republic]]&lt;ref name="granville"&gt;Granville, Johanna, ''The First Domino: International Decision Making during the Hungarian Crisis of 1956'', Texas A&amp;M University Press, 2004. {{ISBN|1-58544-298-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Grenville|2005|pp=370–71}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* The [[People's Republic of Romania]]
* The [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]]&lt;ref name="cook17"&gt;{{Harvnb|Cook|2001|p=17}}&lt;/ref&gt; (which re-aligned itself in the 1960s away from the Soviet Union and towards the People's Republic of China)

Soviet-installed governments ruled the Eastern Bloc countries, with the exception of the [[Socialist Federal Republic of Yugoslavia]], which retained its full independence.

The majority of European states to the east of the Iron Curtain developed their own international economic and military alliances, such as [[COMECON]] and the [[Warsaw Pact]].

====West of the Iron Curtain====
[[File:Curtain germany.jpg|thumb|Fence along the East/West border in Germany (near [[Witzenhausen]]-[[Heilbad Heiligenstadt|Heiligenstadt]])]]
[[File:1 K zone.png|thumb|Sign warning of approach to within one kilometer of the inter-zonal German border, 1986]]

To the west of the Iron Curtain, the countries of Western Europe, Northern Europe, and Southern Europe – along with Austria, West Germany, Liechtenstein and Switzerland – operated [[market economy|market economies]]. With the exception of a period of [[Francoist Spain|fascism in Spain]] (until 1975) and [[Estado Novo (Portugal)|Portugal]] (until 1974) and a [[Greek military junta of 1967–1974|military dictatorship]] in Greece (1967–1974), democratic governments ruled these countries.

Most of the states of Europe to the west of the Iron Curtain – with the exception of [[Neutral country|neutral]] Switzerland, Liechtenstein, Austria, [[Sweden]], [[Finland]], [[Malta]] and Republic of Ireland – allied themselves with the United States and Canada within NATO. Economically, the [[European Community]] and the [[European Free Trade Association]] represented Western counterparts to [[COMECON]]. Most of the nominally neutral states were economically closer to the United States than they were to the [[Warsaw Pact]].{{citation needed|date=July 2012}}

In January 1947 [[Harry Truman]] appointed General [[George Marshall]] as Secretary of State, scrapped Joint Chiefs of Staff (JCS) directive 1067 (which embodied the [[Morgenthau Plan]]) and supplanted it with JCS 1779, which decreed that an orderly and prosperous Europe requires the economic contributions of a stable and productive Germany."&lt;ref name="beschloss277"&gt;{{Harvnb|Beschloss|2003|p=277}}&lt;/ref&gt; Administration officials met with Soviet Foreign Minister [[Vyacheslav Molotov]] and others to press for an economically self-sufficient Germany, including a detailed accounting of the industrial plants, goods and infrastructure already removed by the Soviets.&lt;ref name="miller16"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After five and a half weeks of negotiations, Molotov refused the demands and the talks were adjourned.&lt;ref name="miller16"/&gt; Marshall was particularly discouraged after personally meeting with Stalin, who expressed little interest in a solution to German economic problems.&lt;ref name="miller16"/&gt; The United States concluded that a solution could not wait any longer.&lt;ref name="miller16"/&gt; In a 5 June 1947 speech,&lt;ref name="marshallspeech"&gt;Marshall, George C, [[s:The Marshall Plan Speech|''The Marshal Plan Speech'']], 5 June 1947&lt;/ref&gt; Marshall announced a comprehensive program of American assistance to all European countries wanting to participate, including the Soviet Union and those of Eastern Europe, called the [[Marshall Plan]].&lt;ref name="miller16"/&gt;

Stalin opposed the Marshall Plan. He had built up the [[Eastern Bloc]] protective belt of Soviet-controlled nations on his Western border,&lt;ref name="miller10"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=10}}&lt;/ref&gt; and wanted to maintain this buffer zone of states combined with a weakened Germany under Soviet control.&lt;ref name="miller11"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=11}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fearing American political, cultural and economic penetration, Stalin eventually forbade Soviet [[Eastern bloc]] countries of the newly formed [[Cominform]] from accepting [[Marshall Plan]] aid.&lt;ref name="miller16"/&gt; In [[Czechoslovakia]], that required a Soviet-backed [[Czechoslovak coup d'état of 1948]],&lt;ref name=trueye&gt;''Airbridge to Berlin'', "Eye of the Storm" chapter&lt;/ref&gt; the brutality of which shocked Western powers more than any event so far and set in a motion a brief scare that war would occur and swept away the last vestiges of opposition to the Marshall Plan in the United States Congress.&lt;ref name="miller19"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|p=19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Relations further deteriorated when, in January 1948, the [[United States Department of State|U.S. State Department]] also published a collection of documents titled ''Nazi-Soviet Relations, 1939 – 1941: Documents from the Archives of The German Foreign Office'', which contained documents recovered from the Foreign Office of [[Nazi Germany]]&lt;ref name="henig67"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=preface}}&lt;/ref&gt; revealing Soviet conversations with Germany regarding the [[Molotov–Ribbentrop Pact negotiations|Molotov-Ribbentrop Pact]], including its secret protocol dividing eastern Europe,&lt;ref name="roberts97"&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=97}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|p=78}}&lt;/ref&gt; the [[German–Soviet Commercial Agreement (1939)|1939 German-Soviet Commercial Agreement]],&lt;ref name="roberts97"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Department of State|1948|pp=32–77}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[German–Soviet Axis talks|discussions of the Soviet Union potentially becoming the fourth Axis Power]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Churchill|1953|pp=512–524}}
&lt;/ref&gt; In response, one month later, the Soviet Union published ''[[Falsifiers of History]]'', a Stalin-edited and partially re-written book attacking the West.&lt;ref name="henig67"&gt;{{Harvnb|Henig|2005|p=67}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Roberts|2002|p=96}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the Marshall Plan, the introduction of a new currency to Western Germany to replace the debased [[Reichsmark]] and massive electoral losses for communist parties, in June 1948, the Soviet Union cut off surface road access to [[Berlin]], initiating the [[Berlin Blockade]], which cut off all non-Soviet food, water and other supplies for the citizens of the non-Soviet sectors of Berlin.&lt;ref name="miller25"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|pp=25–31}}&lt;/ref&gt; Because Berlin was located within the Soviet-occupied zone of Germany, the only available methods of supplying the city were three limited air corridors.&lt;ref name="miller6"&gt;{{Harvnb|Miller|2000|pp=6–7}}&lt;/ref&gt; A massive aerial supply campaign was initiated by the United States, Britain, France, and other countries, the success of which caused the Soviets to lift their blockade in May 1949.

One of the conclusions of the [[Yalta Conference]] was that the western Allies would [[Operation Keelhaul|return all Soviet citizens]] who found themselves in their zones to the Soviet Union.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Jacob |last=Hornberger |title=Repatriation – The Dark Side of World War II |publisher=The Future of Freedom Foundation |year=1995 |url=http://www.fff.org/freedom/0495a.asp |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20121014115546/http://www.fff.org/freedom/0495a.asp |archivedate=14 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; This affected the liberated Soviet prisoners of war (branded as traitors), forced laborers, anti-Soviet collaborators with the Germans, and anti-communist refugees.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author=[[Nikolai Tolstoy]]| title=[[The Secret Betrayal]] | publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons | year = 1977 | isbn = 0-684-15635-0 | page = 360 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Migration from east to west of the Iron Curtain, except under limited circumstances, was effectively halted after 1950. Before 1950, over 15 million people (mainly ethnic Germans) emigrated from Soviet-occupied eastern European countries to the west in the five years immediately following [[World War II]].&lt;ref name="bocker207"&gt;{{Harvnb|Böcker|1998|p=207}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, restrictions implemented during the Cold War stopped most East-West migration, with only 13.3 million migrations westward between 1950 and 1990.&lt;ref name="bocker209"&gt;{{Harvnb|Böcker|1998|p=209}}&lt;/ref&gt; More than 75% of those emigrating from Eastern Bloc countries between 1950 and 1990 did so under bilateral agreements for "ethnic migration."&lt;ref name="bocker209"/&gt;

About 10% were refugees permitted to emigrate under the [[Geneva Convention]] of 1951.&lt;ref name="bocker209"/&gt; Most Soviets allowed to leave during this time period were ethnic Jews permitted to emigrate to Israel after a series of embarrassing defections in 1970 caused the Soviets to open very limited ethnic emigrations.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Krasnov|1985|pp=1&amp;126}}&lt;/ref&gt; The fall of the Iron Curtain was accompanied by a massive rise in European East-West migration.&lt;ref name="bocker209"/&gt;

===As a physical entity===

{{Further|Inner German border|Czechoslovakian border fortifications during the Cold War}}
[[File:Moedlareuth Museum 2002b.jpg|thumb|Preserved section of the border between [[East Germany]] and West Germany called the "Little Berlin Wall" at [[Mödlareuth]].]]

The Iron Curtain took physical shape in the form of border defenses between the countries of western and eastern Europe. There were some of the most heavily militarised areas in the world, particularly the so-called "[[inner German border]]" – commonly known as ''die Grenze'' in German – between East and West Germany. The inner German border was marked in rural areas by double fences made of steel mesh (expanded metal) with sharp edges, while near urban areas a high concrete barrier similar to the [[Berlin Wall]] was built. The installation of the Wall in 1961 brought an end to a decade during which the divided capital of divided Germany was one of the easiest places to move west across the Iron Curtain.&lt;ref&gt;Keeling, Drew (2014), business-of-migration.com [http://www.business-of-migration.com/migration-processes/other-regions/berlin-wall-and-migration/ "Berlin Wall and Migration," ''Migration as a travel business'']&lt;/ref&gt;

The barrier was always a short distance inside East German territory to avoid any intrusion into Western territory. The actual borderline was marked by posts and signs and was overlooked by numerous watchtowers set behind the barrier. The strip of land on the West German side of the barrier – between the actual borderline and the barrier – was readily accessible but only at considerable personal risk, because it was patrolled by both East and West German border guards.

[[File:Point Alpha Ostseite.jpg|thumb|Fence along the former East-West border in Germany]]
Several villages, many historic, were destroyed as they lay too close to the border, for example [[Erlebach]]. Shooting incidents were not uncommon, and a total of 28 East German border guards and several hundred civilians were killed between 1948 – 1981 (some may have been victims of "[[friendly fire]]" by their own side).

Elsewhere along the border between West and East, the defense works resembled those on the intra-German border. During the Cold War, the border zone in Hungary started {{convert|15|km}} from the border. Citizens could only enter the area if they lived in the zone or had a passport valid for traveling out. Traffic control points and patrols enforced this regulation.

Those who lived within the {{convert|15|km}} border-zone needed special permission to enter the area within {{convert|5|km}} of the border. The area was very difficult to approach and heavily fortified. In the 1950s and 1960s, a double barbed-wire fence was installed {{convert|50|m}} from the border. The space between the two fences were laden with [[land mine]]s. The minefield was later replaced with an electric signal fence (about {{convert|1|km}} from the border) and a barbed wire fence, along with guard towers and a sand strip to track border violations.

Regular patrols sought to prevent escape attempts. They included cars and mounted units. Guards and dog patrol units watched the border 24/7 and were authorised to use their weapons to stop escapees. The wire fence nearest the actual border was irregularly displaced from the actual border, which was marked only by stones. Anyone attempting to escape would have to cross up to {{convert|400|m}} before they could cross the actual border. Several escape attempts failed when the escapees were stopped after crossing the outer fence.

In parts of [[Czechoslovakia]], the border strip became hundreds of meters wide, and an area of increasing restrictions was defined as the border was approached. Only people with the appropriate government permissions were allowed to get close to the border.

The Soviet Union built a fence along the entire border to [[Norway]] and [[Finland]]. It is located one or a few kilometres from the border, and has automatic alarms detecting if someone climbs over it.

In [[Greece]], a highly militarised area called the "Επιτηρούμενη Ζώνη" ("Surveillance Area") was created by the Greek Army along the Greek-Bulgarian border, subject to significant security-related regulations and restrictions. Inhabitants within this 25&amp;nbsp;km wide strip of land were forbidden to drive cars, own land bigger than 60 m&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; and had to travel within the area with a special passport issued by Greek military authorities. Additionally, the Greek state used this area to encapsulate and monitor a non-Greek ethnic minority, the [[Pomaks]], a Muslim and Bulgarian-speaking minority which was regarded as hostile to the interests of the Greek state during the Cold War because of its familiarity with their fellow Pomaks living on the other side of the Iron Curtain.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.dur.ac.uk/resources/ibru/publications/full/bsb7-2_labrianidis.pdf Lois Labrianidis, The impact of the Greek military surveillance zone on the Greek side of the Bulgarian-Greek borderlands], 1999&lt;/ref&gt;

The Hungarian outer fence became the first part of the Iron Curtain to be dismantled. After the border fortifications were dismantled, a section was rebuilt for a formal ceremony. On 27 June 1989, the [[foreign minister]]s of Austria and Hungary, [[Alois Mock]] and [[Gyula Horn]], ceremonially cut through the border defences separating their countries.

The creation of these highly militarised no-man's lands led to ''de facto'' nature reserves and created a [[wildlife corridor]] across Europe; this helped the spread of several species to new territories. Since the fall of the Iron Curtain, several initiatives are pursuing the creation of a [[European Green Belt]] nature preserve area along the Iron Curtain's former route. In fact, a [[long-distance cycling route]] along the length of the former border called the [[Iron Curtain Trail]] (ICT) exists as a project of the European Union and other associated nations. The trail is {{Convert|6,800|km|abbr=on}} long and spans from [[Finland]] to [[Greece]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ironcurtaintrail.eu/en/der_iron_curtain_trail/index.html |title=The Iron Curtain Trail |publisher=Ironcurtaintrail.eu |date= |accessdate=2013-11-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The term "Iron Curtain" was only used for the fortified borders in Europe; it was not used for similar borders in Asia between communist and capitalist states (these were, for a time, dubbed the [[Bamboo Curtain]]). The [[Korean Demilitarized Zone|border between North Korea and South Korea]] is very comparable to the former inner German border, particularly in its degree of militarisation, but it has never conventionally been considered part of any Iron Curtain.

[[File:EasternBloc PostDissolution2008.svg|thumb|The dissolution of the Eastern Bloc.]]

Following a period of [[Brezhnev stagnation|economic and political stagnation]] under Brezhnev and his immediate successors, the Soviet Union decreased its intervention in [[Eastern Bloc politics]]. [[Mikhail Gorbachev]] (General Secretary from 1985) decreased adherence to the [[Brezhnev Doctrine]],&lt;ref name="crampton338"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=338}}&lt;/ref&gt; which held that if socialism were threatened in any state then other socialist governments had an obligation to intervene to preserve it, in favor of the "[[Sinatra Doctrine]]". He also initiated the policies of ''[[glasnost]]'' (openness) and ''[[perestroika]]'' (economic restructuring). A wave of [[Revolutions of 1989|Revolutions occurred throughout the Eastern Bloc]] in 1989.&lt;ref name="Szafarz-221"&gt;E.

After receiving an informal clearance from [[Gorbachev]] (who said "there will not be a new 1956") on March 3. 1989, on May 2 of the same year [[Hungary|the Hungarian government]] announced and started in [[Rajka]] (in the locality known as the "city of three borders", on the border with Austria and Czechoslovakia) the destruction of the Iron Curtain, whose last section will be demolished with an official ceremony, attended by the highest authorities of the [[Austria|Federal Republic of Austria]], on 27 June 1989, which had the function of calling all European peoples still under the yoke of the national-communist regimes to freedom.

In April 1989 the [[People's Republic of Poland]] legalised the [[Solidarity (Polish trade union)|Solidarity]] organisation, which captured 99% of available parliamentary seats in June.&lt;ref name="crampton392"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=392}}&lt;/ref&gt; These elections, in which anti-communist candidates won a striking victory, inaugurated a series of [[Revolutions of 1989|peaceful anti-communist revolutions]] in [[Central Europe|Central]] and Eastern Europe&lt;ref name="O'K"&gt;

On 19 August 1989, more than 600 East Germans attending the "[[Pan-European Picnic]]" on the Hungarian border broke through the Iron Curtain and fled into Austria. Hungarian border guards had threatened to shoot anyone crossing the border, but when the time came, they did not intervene and allowed the people to cross. In a historic session from 16 to 20 October, the [[Hungary|Hungarian]] parliament adopted legislation providing for multi-party parliamentary elections and a direct presidential election.&lt;ref name="crampton394"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|pp=394–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legislation transformed Hungary from a [[People's Republic]] into the [[Republic of Hungary]], guaranteed human and civil rights, and created an institutional structure that ensured separation of powers among the judicial, legislative, and executive branches of government. In November 1989, following mass protests in [[East Germany]] and the relaxing of border restrictions in Czechoslovakia, tens of thousands of [[East Berlin]]ers flooded checkpoints along the [[Berlin Wall]], crossing into [[West Berlin]].&lt;ref name="crampton394"/&gt;

In the [[People's Republic of Bulgaria]], the day after the mass crossings across the Berlin Wall, leader [[Todor Zhivkov]] was ousted.&lt;ref name="crampton395"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|pp=395–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Czechoslovak Socialist Republic]], following protests of an estimated half-million Czechoslovaks, the government permitted travel to the west and abolished provisions guaranteeing the ruling Communist party its leading role, preceding the [[Velvet Revolution]].&lt;ref name="crampton398"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=398}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Socialist Republic of Romania]], on 22 December 1989, the Romanian military sided with protesters and turned on Communist ruler [[Nicolae Ceauşescu]], who was executed after a brief trial three days later.&lt;ref name="crampton400"&gt;{{Harvnb|Crampton|1997|p=400}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[People's Socialist Republic of Albania]], a new package of regulations went into effect on 3 July 1990 entitling all Albanians over the age of 16 to own a passport for foreign travel. Meanwhile, hundreds of Albanian citizens gathered around foreign embassies to seek political asylum and flee the country.

The Berlin Wall officially remained guarded after 9 November 1989, although the inter-German border had become effectively meaningless. The official dismantling of the Wall by the East German military did not begin until June 1990. In July 1990, the day East Germany adopted the [[Deutsche Mark|West German currency]], all border-controls ceased and [[West Germany|West German]] Chancellor [[Helmut Kohl]] convinced Gorbachev to drop Soviet objections to a reunited Germany within NATO in return for substantial German economic aid to the Soviet Union.

==Monuments==
[[File:Iron Curtain - Hungary.jpg|thumb|Memorial in [[Budapest]] reads: "''Iron Curtain 1949-1989''".]]
There is an Iron Curtain monument in the southern part of the Czech Republic at approximately {{Coord|48.8755|15.87477|type:landmark|display=inline|name=Iron Curtain monument}}. A few hundred meters of the original fence, and one of the guard towers, has remained installed. There are interpretive signs in Czech and English that explain the history and significance of the Iron Curtain. This is the only surviving part of the fence in the Czech Republic, though several guard towers and bunkers can still be seen. Some of these are part of the Communist Era defences, some are from the never-used [[Czechoslovak border fortifications]] in defence against [[Adolf Hitler]], and some towers were, or have become, hunting platforms.

Another monument is located in Fertőrákos, Hungary, at the site of the [[Pan-European Picnic]]. On the eastern hill of the stone quarry stands a metal sculpture by [[Gabriela von Habsburg]]. It is a column made of metal and barbed wire with the date of the Pan-European Picnic and the names of participants. On the ribbon under the board is the Latin text: "In necessariis unitas – in dubiis libertas – in omnibus caritas." (Unity in unavoidable matters – freedom in doubtful matters – love in all things.) The memorial symbolises the iron curtain and recalls forever the memories of the border breakthrough in 1989.

Another monument is located in the village of [[Devín]], now part of [[Bratislava]], [[Slovakia]], at the confluence of the [[Danube]] and [[Morava River (Central Europe)|Morava]] rivers.

There are several open air museums in parts of the former inner German border, as for example in Berlin and in [[Mödlareuth]], a village that has been divided for several hundred years. The memory of the division is being kept alive in many other places along the ''Grenze''.

'''James Gerard Richard Shortt''' (born 16 September 1953) is the [[Director General]] of the International Bodyguard Association (IBA)&lt;ref name="ibabodyguards.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibabodyguards.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=33&amp;Itemid=69&amp;lang=en|title=International Bodyguard Association - History|accessdate=6 February 2009|website=ibabodyguards.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120731100059/http://www.ibabodyguards.com/cms/index.php?option=com_content&amp;view=article&amp;id=33&amp;Itemid=69&amp;lang=en|archivedate=31 July 2012|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; and author of several books on military special forces and martial arts.

On several occasions Shortt has been exposed by British [[tabloid newspapers]] for [[Military imposter|passing himself off]] as a much-decorated [[Special Air Service|SAS]] and [[Parachute Regiment (United Kingdom)|Parachute Regiment]] veteran, as well as exposing his claims to other military and nobiliary credentials.&lt;ref name="thesun.co.uk-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="thesun.co.uk-2"/&gt;

==Career==
Shortt has been the Director-General of the International Bodyguard Association since February 1990.&lt;ref name="IBADeutch"&gt;{{cite web|title=I.B.A. Deutschland - International Bodyguard Association|url=http://www.iba-deutschland.de/german/j_shortt.php|website=www.iba-deutschland.de|accessdate=25 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shortt has also authored several books dealing with military special forces units-particularly the British SAS, as well as been interviewed by other authors on military subjects.

==Controversy==
Shortt has made various claims regarding his military service when interviewed or providing consultations.  In ''The Gun Digest Book of Assault Weapons'' Shortt under the alias "Seamus Shortt" is described as a "British [[Royal Marine]] ([[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|TA]])" and that "Shortt has other military training as well, but details of it are still classified".&lt;ref name="Lewis"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Lewis, Jack |author2=Campbell, Robert K.|author3=Steele, David|title=The Gun Digest Book of Assault Weapons|edition=7th, illustrated, revised|year=2007|publisher=Gun Digest|page=129|ISBN=0-89689-498-3|chapter=The Combat Training Team|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=P75lJjon9yoC}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In ''The SAS Fighting Techniques Handbook'', author Terry White thanked Shortt for his insights in close personal protection and [[counter-terrorism]]. White states in his acknowledgements that he believed Shortt to be a "former member of the British Parachute Regiment and Special Air Service".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=White|first1=Terry|title=The SAS Fighting Techniques Handbook|accessdate=28 May 2017|year=2007|publisher=Globe Pequot|page=vii|ISBN=1-59921-081-9|chapter=Acknowledgements|chapterurl=https://books.google.com/books?id=QqWZEY-zz8AC&amp;pg=PR7&amp;dq=shortt+SAS}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 29 January 2009, the British tabloid ''[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]'' ran an article which revealed that Shortt had never belonged to either the Special Air Service (SAS) or the Parachute Regiment.  He had only been a [[Combat Medical Technician|medic]] in the [[Territorial Army (United Kingdom)|Territorial Army]] and had left within months of joining.  This matter came to light after Brian Ware, who headed the security department at the [[Cabinet Office]], was suspended for allowing Shortt on to the property without ensuring he had proper authorization or vetting his credentials. Shortt had been invited by Ware as a security advisor.&lt;ref name="thesun.co.uk-1"&gt;{{cite news|first=Tom Newton |last=Dunn |title=Fake SAS man given Cabinet security job|url=http://thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/campaigns/our_boys/article2183915.ece|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|date=29 January 2009|accessdate=6 February 2009|deadurl=unfit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090201034550/http://thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/campaigns/our_boys/article2183915.ece|archivedate=1 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The following day ''The Sun'' quoted several other dubious claims listed on Shortt's CV, including his claim of being an Irish [[baron]], being made a [[Order of St. Gregory the Great|Knight Commander of St Gregory]] by Pope [[John Paul II]], as well as having a ''Gant d’Or'' ("golden gloves") in French [[Savate]] and a 9th Dan [[Black belt (martial arts)|black belt]] in traditional Japanese [[Ju Jutsu]] from the "Dai Nihon Seibukan in Kyoto, Japan".&lt;ref name="thesun.co.uk-2"&gt;{{cite news|title=The Whip|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/columnists/thewhip/article2195175.ece|work=[[The Sun (United Kingdom)|The Sun]]|date=30 January 2009|accessdate=11 February 2009|deadurl=unfit|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110606224404/http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/columnists/thewhip/article2195175.ece|archivedate=6 June 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''La Ferté-Alais Air Show''' is an annual meeting of aviation enthusiasts in [[La Ferté-Alais]], [[France]].

It takes place during [[Pentecost]] at the [[Cerny, Essonne|Cerny]] airfield {{coord|48|29|50|N|2|20|13|E}}, which is owned and operated by the "Amicale Jean-Baptiste Salis" (AJ-BS).

The airfield is also the site of a museum which sports an impressive number of pre-[[World War I]] up to present aircraft.

The [[B-17 Flying Fortress]] used in the motion picture [[Memphis Belle (film)|Memphis Belle]] is a permanent project of the AJ-BS group.

During the show, dozens of vintage aircraft are assembled from Europe and the US for display and flight demonstrations. The French air force usually demonstrates some new air capacity (paratroops, etc.) as well as overflight by the [[Patrouille de France]], the French aerobatic team (similar to the [[Blue Angels]], [[Thunderbirds (squadron)|Thunderbirds]] in the US). Also, Airbus or other aircraft manufacturers will fly their latest commercial aircraft, such as the A-300 series of jetliners.

== History ==

The launch of the UAE began with the consensus of the rulers of the emirates of [[Emirate of Abu Dhabi|Abu Dhabi]], [[Emirate of Dubai|Dubai]], [[Emirate of Sharjah|Sharjah]], [[Emirate of Ajman|Ajman]], [[Fujairah]], and [[Umm Al Quwain]] on 2 December 1971 and their agreement to unite. The approved interim constitution regulated the state and determined its goals. On the tenth of February 1972, it was announced that the emirate of Ras Al Khaimah was joining the Union to complete the seven Emirates held in a single entity.

In 1968, Britain declared its willingness to withdraw from all protectorates and colonies of the Eastern Mediterranean, the idea of the Union begun to crystallize at a meeting between Sheikh Zayed bin Sultan Al Nahyan and Sheikh Rashid bin Saeed Al Maktoum, in the village of Samih border on February 18, 1968 [1] and they agreed that the best way is the union between them and invite the Gulf emirates to this union. The UAE does not celebrate any independence day represented by the British declaration of withdrawing from the area in 1968, it celebrates a union day that happened three years after on 2 December 1971.

The '''North Dakota State Fair''' is an annual [[state fair]] held each July in [[Minot, North Dakota]], USA. The fair has carnival rides, agricultural expositions, government and commercial exhibitions, and a variety of musical and performance entertainment.

The fairgrounds are located along [[Quentin N. Burdick|Burdick]] Expressway in east Minot. The facilities on the site are used for a variety of other events; the grandstand is regularly used for Nodak Speedway stock car races, and the [[All Seasons Arena (Minot)|All Seasons Arena]] is frequently used for conventions, sporting events and festivals, including [[Norsk Høstfest]].

The fair was first held in Minot in 1922 but was not officially sanctioned by the state government until 1966. The North Dakota State Fair is the largest event in the state, drawing around 250,000 people.[http://www.ndstatefair.com/news/view.asp?ID=35] Attendance increased every year from 2000 to 2005.

In 2009, the fair has set a record with the attendance of 296,919. The 2010 fair increased its record to over 308,000. The 2012 Fair increased its record to 310,839 and it increased even further for the 2013 fair to 320,486.

On July 10, 2011, it was announced that the 2011 fair would be cancelled because of the [[2011 Souris River flood]] a month before which left much of the grounds underwater. This announcement came after originally planning to hold the fair without competitive events.

[[File:Boxer (dog).jpg|thumb|[[Boxer (dog)|Boxers]] with natural and cropped ears and docked tails]]
Numerous '''procedures performed on domestic animals''' are more [[Invasiveness of surgical procedures|invasive]] than purely cosmetic alterations, but differ from types of [[veterinary surgery]] that are performed exclusively for urgent health reasons. Such procedures have been grouped together under the technical term "mutilatory" by the [[Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons]] in a report describing the reasons for their being conducted and their [[animal welfare|welfare]] consequences,&lt;ref name=RCVS&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cdb.org/vets/mutilations.htm|title=RCVS List of Mutilatory Procedures|accessdate=9 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by others.&lt;ref name=Sneddon and Gentle&gt;{{cite web|url=http://agriculture.de/acms1/conf6/ws5apain.html|title=Pain in animals|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.defra.gov.uk/publications/files/pb7275meat-chickens-020717.pdf|title=Defra codes of recommendations|accessdate=3 October 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The term "mutilatory" generally connotes some form of disfigurement or even maiming. However, there are multiple definitions and interpretations that carry varying degrees of emotional intensity. For example, [[Merriam-Webster]] defines "mutilate" as "to cut up or alter radically so as to make imperfect", but gives a relatively mild example: "the child mutilated the book with his scissors".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/mutilate Definition of "Mutilate"], merriam-webster.com&lt;/ref&gt; Thus, while the Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons noted that the term "mutilation" is often an emotive one, having implications in common usage of maiming and disfigurement, they stated that there was no satisfactory alternative term that would suffice for their purposes. Their definition is a narrower one: "covering all procedures, carried out with or without instruments which involve interference with the sensitive tissues or the bone structure of an animal, and are carried out for non-therapeutic reasons."&lt;ref name=RCVS/&gt;  

The following table contains procedures performed on [[List of domesticated animals|domesticated animals]] that may or may not have a purported therapeutic purpose.

It is run by the Palm Springs International Film Society, which also runs the [[Palm Springs International Festival of Short Films]] (ShortFest), a festival of short films and film market in June.

Though the festival does feature American [[independent film]]s, the focus from its inception was to shine a spotlight on international cinema.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"&gt;Susan King (January 2, 2013), [http://www.latimes.com/entertainment/envelope/moviesnow/la-et-mn-palm-springs-film-festival20130103,0,2918749.story Palm Springs film fest lineup includes black and white silent films] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Details==
Michael Barker, co-president of [[Sony Pictures Classics]], described the festival as a good place to show foreign-language movies and heralded this festival's ability to spread good [[word-of-mouth]] for movies. The event is noted for screening most foreign [[Academy Award|Oscar]] nominees. In 2013, the festival screened 42 of the 71 movies that were submitted by countries around the world to the Oscars for that year's foreign language film prize.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt;

In the days before the festival's opening, several of the foreign filmmakers convene at [[Sunnylands]], the Annenberg estate in Rancho Mirage, to trade strategies on funding, producing and promoting their movies.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Keegan (January 6, 2011), [http://articles.latimes.com/2011/jan/06/entertainment/la-et-palm-springs-film-20110106 Palm Springs International Film Fest mixes glamour, grit] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

The festival regularly attracts around 135,000 people, with some 70% coming from outside of the [[Coachella Valley]], including Canada and Europe.&lt;ref name="latimes.com"/&gt; It is noted for its Award Ceremonies where such actors as [[Brad Pitt]], [[Clint Eastwood]], [[Sean Penn]], [[Dustin Hoffman]], [[Anne Hathaway]] and [[Leonardo DiCaprio]] have appeared. In January 2011, the festival's honorees included [[Ben Affleck]] and [[Danny Boyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.psfilmfest.org/news/detail.aspx?NID=285&amp;year=2010 |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-01-25 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120311074954/http://www.psfilmfest.org/news/detail.aspx?NID=285&amp;year=2010 |archivedate=2012-03-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The current director of the festival is Darryl Macdonald, long time festival director for the Seattle Film Festival.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.variety.com/awardcentral_article/VR1117956436.html?nav=news&amp;categoryid=1983&amp;cs=1|title=VR’s first stop won’t be at home|first=Matt|last=Rothman|date=8 March 1993|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Pompeii-couple.jpg|thumb|right|This wall painting found in the Roman city of [[Pompeii]] is an example of a primary source about people in Pompeii in Roman times. ([[Portrait of Paquius Proculo]])]]

In the study of [[history]] as an academic discipline, a '''primary source''' (also called an '''original source''') is an [[Artifact (archaeology)|artifact]], document, diary, [[manuscript]], [[autobiography]], recording, or any other source of [[information]] that was created at the time under study. It serves as an original source of information about the topic. Similar definitions can be used in [[library science]], and other areas of scholarship, although different fields have somewhat different definitions. In [[journalism]], a primary source can be a person with direct knowledge of a situation, or a document written by such a person.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Journalism: Primary Sources|url=http://infoguides.pepperdine.edu/c.php?g=287355&amp;p=1915752|publisher=Pepperdine University|accessdate=January 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Primary sources are distinguished from [[secondary sources]], which cite, comment on, or build upon primary sources. Generally, accounts written after the fact with the benefit (and possible distortions) of hindsight are secondary.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://web.archive.org/web/20130726061349/http://www.lib.umd.edu/ues/guides/primary-sources Primary, secondary and tertiary sources]". University Libraries, University of Maryland. &lt;/ref&gt; A secondary source may also be a primary source depending on how it is used.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ithacalibrary.com/sp/subjects/primary Primary and secondary sources]". Ithaca College Library.&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a memoir would be considered a primary source in research concerning its author or about his or her friends characterized within it, but the same memoir would be a secondary source if it were used to examine the culture in which its author lived. "Primary" and "secondary" should be understood as relative terms, with sources categorized according to specific historical contexts and what is being studied.&lt;ref name=Handlin/&gt;{{rp|118–246}}&lt;ref name=Kragh&gt;{{Cite book| last=Kragh| first=Helge| title=An Introduction to the Historiography of Science| year=1989| publisher=Cambridge University Press| isbn=0-521-38921-6| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=d2zy_QSq2b0C&amp;pg=PA121&amp;lpg=PA121&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography |page=121 |quote=[T]he distinction is not a sharp one.

==Significance of source classification==

===History===

[[File:donfelipe.jpg|thumb|360px|right|From a letter of Philip II, King of Spain, 16th century]]

===Other fields===
In scholarly writing, the objective of classifying sources is to determine the independence and reliability of sources.&lt;ref name=Kragh/&gt; Though the terms ''primary source'' and ''secondary source'' originated in [[historiography]]{{Citation needed|date=August 2008}} as a way to trace the history of historical ideas, they have been applied to many other fields. For example, these ideas may be used to trace the history of scientific theories, literary elements and other information that is passed from one author to another.

In [[scientific literature]], a primary source is the original publication of a scientist's new data, results and theories. In [[political history]], primary sources are documents such as official reports, speeches, pamphlets, posters, or letters by participants, official election returns and eyewitness accounts. In the [[history of ideas]] or [[intellectual history]], the main primary sources are books, essays and letters written by intellectuals; these intellectuals may include historians, whose books and essays are therefore considered primary sources for the intellectual historian, though they are secondary sources in their own topical fields. In [[religious history]], the primary sources are [[religious texts]] and descriptions of religious [[ceremonies]] and [[rituals]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://researchguides.library.tufts.edu/content.php?pid=60919&amp;sid=447878|title=Primary Sources - Religion|website=Research Guides at Tufts University|date=26 August 2014|accessdate=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A study of [[cultural history]] could include fictional sources such as novels or plays. In a broader sense primary sources also include artifacts like photographs, newsreels, coins, paintings or buildings created at the time. Historians may also take [[Artifact (archaeology)|archaeological artifacts]] and oral reports and interviews into consideration. Written sources may be divided into three types.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book | last1 = Howell | first1 = Martha C. | last2 = Prevenier | first2 = Walter. | title = From reliable sources : an introduction to historical method | year = 2001 | publisher = Cornell University Press | location = Ithaca, N.Y. | isbn = 0-8014-8560-6 | pages =20–22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Narrative]] sources''' or '''literary sources''' tell a story or message. They are not limited to fictional sources (which can be sources of information for contemporary attitudes) but include [[diary|diaries]], films, biographies, leading philosophical works and [[scientific works]].
*'''Diplomatic sources''' include [[charter]]s and other legal documents which usually follow a set format.
*'''Social documents''' are records created by organizations, such as registers of births and tax records.

In historiography, when the study of history is subject to historical scrutiny, a secondary source becomes a primary source. For a biography of a historian, that historian's publications would be primary sources. Documentary films can be considered a secondary source or primary source, depending on how much the filmmaker modifies the original sources.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Cripps |first=Thomas |year=1995 |title=Historical Truth: An Interview with Ken Burns |journal=American Historical Review |volume=100 |issue=3 |pages=741–764 |doi=10.2307/2168603 |jstor= 2168603|publisher=The American Historical Review, Vol. 100, No. 3 |postscript=. |ref=harv }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Lafayette College Library, provides a synopsis of primary sources in several areas of study:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The definition of a primary source varies depending upon the academic discipline and the context in which it is used.&lt;br&gt;
*In the [[humanities]], a primary source could be defined as something that was created either during the time period being studied or afterward by individuals reflecting on their involvement in the events of that time.
*In the [[social sciences]], the definition of a primary source would be expanded to include numerical data that has been gathered to analyze relationships between people, events, and their environment.
*In the [[natural sciences]], a primary source could be defined as a report of original findings or ideas. These sources often appear in the form of research articles with sections on methods and results."&lt;ref&gt;[http://library.lafayette.edu/help/primary/definitions "Primary Sources: what are they?"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090208191118/http://library.lafayette.edu/help/primary/definitions |date=8 February 2009 }}. Lafayette College Library.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Finding primary sources==
Although many primary sources remain in private hands, others are located in [[archives]], [[libraries]], [[museum]]s, [[historical societies]], and [[special collections]]. These can be public or private. Some are affiliated with universities and colleges, while others are government entities. Materials relating to one area might be spread over a large number of different institutions. These can be distant from the original source of the document. For example, the [[Huntington Library]] in California houses a large number of documents from the United Kingdom.

In the US, digital copies of primary sources can be retrieved from a number of places. The [[Library of Congress]] maintains several digital collections where they can be retrieved. Some examples are [http://www.memory.loc.gov American Memory] and [[Chronicling America]]. The [[National Archives and Records Administration]] also has digital collections in [http://digitalvaults.org/ Digital Vaults]. The [[Digital Public Library of America]] searches across the digitized primary source collections of many libraries, archives, and museums. The [[Internet Archive]] also has primary source materials in many formats.

In the UK, the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)|National Archives]] provides a consolidated search of its own catalogue and a wide variety of other archives listed on the Access to Archives index. Digital copies of various classes of documents at the National Archives (including wills) are available from DocumentsOnline. Most of the available documents relate to England and Wales. Some digital copies of primary sources are available from the [[National Archives of Scotland]]. Many County Record Offices collections are included in Access to Archives, while others have their own on-line catalogues. Many County Record Offices will supply digital copies of documents.

In other regions, [[Europeana]] has digitized materials from across Europe while the [[World Digital Library]] and [[Flickr Commons]] have items from all over the world. [[Trove]] has primary sources from Australia.

Most primary source materials are not digitized and may only be represented online with a record or [[finding aid]]. Both digitized and not digitized materials can be found through catalogs such as [[WorldCat]], the [https://catalog2.loc.gov/ Library of Congress catalog], the [https://www.archives.gov/research/catalog/ National Archives catalog], and so on.

==Using primary sources==
History as an academic discipline is based on primary sources, as evaluated by the community of scholars, who report their findings in books, articles and papers. [[Arthur Marwick]] says "Primary sources are absolutely fundamental to history."&lt;ref name=Marwick&gt;Marwick, Arthur. "Primary Sources: Handle with Care". In Sources and Methods for Family and Community Historians: A Handbook edited by Michael Drake and Ruth Finnegan. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press, 1997. {{ISBN|0-521-46580-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ideally, a historian will use all available primary sources that were created by the people involved at the time being studied. In practice some sources have been destroyed, while others are not available for research. Perhaps the only eyewitness reports of an event may be [[memoir]]s, autobiographies, or oral interviews taken years later. Sometimes the only evidence relating to an event or person in the distant past was written or copied decades or centuries later. Manuscripts that are sources for classical texts can be copies of documents, or fragments of copies of documents. This is a common problem in [[classical studies]], where sometimes only a summary of a book or letter has survived. Potential difficulties with primary sources have the result that history is usually taught in schools using secondary sources.

Historians studying the modern period with the intention of publishing an academic article prefer to go back to available primary sources and to seek new (in other words, forgotten or lost) ones. Primary sources, whether accurate or not, offer new input into historical questions and most modern history revolves around heavy use of [[archive]]s and special collections for the purpose of finding useful primary sources. A work on history is not likely to be taken seriously as scholarship if it only cites secondary sources, as it does not indicate that original research has been done.&lt;ref name=Handlin/&gt;

However, primary sources – particularly those from before the 20th century – may have hidden challenges. "Primary sources, in fact, are usually fragmentary, ambiguous and very difficult to analyse and interpret."&lt;ref name=Marwick/&gt; Obsolete meanings of familiar words and social context are among the traps that await the newcomer to historical studies. For this reason, the interpretation of primary texts is typically taught as part of an advanced college or postgraduate history course, although advanced self-study or informal training is also possible.

The following questions are asked about primary sources:
* What is the tone?
* Who is the intended audience?
* What is the purpose of the publication?
* What assumptions does the author make?
* What are the bases of the author's conclusions?
* Does the author agree or disagree with other authors of the subject?
* Does the content agree with what you know or have learned about the issue?
* Where was the source made? (questions of [[systemic bias]])

==Strengths and weaknesses==
In many fields and contexts, such as historical writing, it is almost always advisable to use primary sources if possible, and "if none are available, it is only with great caution that [the author] may proceed to make use of secondary sources."&lt;ref name=Cipolla/&gt; In addition, primary sources avoid the problem inherent in secondary sources in which each new author may distort and put a new spin on the findings of prior cited authors.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ross|first=Jeffrey Ian|title=Taking Stock of Research Methods and Analysis on Oppositional Political Terrorism|journal=The American Sociologist|volume=35|issue=2|year=2004|pages=26–37|doi=10.1007/BF02692395|quote=The analysis of secondary source information is problematic. The further an investigator is from the primary source, the more distorted the information may be. Again, each new person may put his or her spin on the findings.|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{quote|text="A history, whose author draws conclusions from other than primary sources or secondary sources actually based on primary sources, is by definition [[fiction]] and not history at all."|sign=Kameron Searle|}}

However, a primary source is not necessarily more of an authority or better than a secondary source. There can be [[bias]] and tacit unconscious views which twist historical information.
{{quote|"Original material may be... prejudiced, or at least not exactly what it claims to be."|David Iredale&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book  | last1 = Iredale | first1 = David | title = Enjoying archives: what they are, where to find them, how to use them | year = 1973 | publisher = Newton Abbot, David and Charles, | isbn = 0-7153-5669-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;}} The errors may be corrected in secondary sources, which are often subjected to [[peer review]], can be well documented, and are often written by historians working in institutions where methodological accuracy is important to the future of the author's career and reputation. Historians consider the accuracy and [[objectivity (science)|objectiveness]] of the primary sources that they are using and historians subject both primary and secondary sources to a high level of scrutiny. A primary source such as a [[Diary|journal]] entry (or the online version, a blog), at best, may only reflect one individual's [[opinion]] on events, which may or may not be truthful, accurate, or complete.

Participants and [[witness|eyewitness]]es may misunderstand events or distort their reports, deliberately or not, to enhance their own image or importance. Such effects can increase over time, as people create a narrative that may not be accurate.&lt;ref&gt;Barbara W. Sommer and Mary Kay Quinlan, ''The Oral History Manual'' (2002)&lt;/ref&gt; For any source, primary or secondary, it is important for the researcher to evaluate the amount and direction of bias.&lt;ref&gt;Library of Congress, " Analysis of Primary Sources" [http://memory.loc.gov/learn/lessons/psources/analyze.html online 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; As an example, a government report may be an accurate and unbiased description of events, but it may be [[censorship|censored]] or altered for propaganda or [[cover-up]] purposes. The facts can be [[distortion|distorted]] to present the opposing sides in a negative light. [[Barrister]]s are taught that evidence in a court case may be truthful but may still be distorted to support or oppose the position of one of the parties.

==Classifying sources==
Many sources can be considered either primary or secondary, depending on the context in which they are examined.&lt;ref name=Kragh/&gt; Moreover, the distinction between ''primary'' and ''secondary'' sources is subjective and contextual,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Dalton| first1=Margaret Stieg|last2=Charnigo|first2=Laurie|title=Historians and Their Information Sources|journal=College &amp; Research Libraries|date=September 2004|volume=65|issue=5|page=419| doi=10.5860/crl.65.5.400|url=http://crl.acrl.org/content/65/5/400.full.pdf+html|accessdate=3 January 2017}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; so that precise definitions are difficult to make.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last1=Delgadillo|first1=Roberto|last2=Lynch|first2=Beverly|title=Future Historians: Their Quest for Information|url=http://crl.acrl.org/content/60/3/245.full.pdf+html|journal=College &amp; Research Libraries|date=May 1999|volume=60|issue=3 |pages=245–259, at 253|quote=[T]he same document can be a primary or a secondary source depending on the particular analysis the historian is doing.|ref=harv}} {{open access}}&lt;/ref&gt; A book review, when it contains the opinion of the reviewer about the book rather than a summary of the book, becomes a primary source.&lt;ref name="Princeton"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://wordnetweb.princeton.edu/perl/webwn?s=book%20review|title=Book reviews |accessdate=22 September 2011 |publisher=Princeton |year=2011 |author=Princeton|work=Scholarly definition document }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="VirginiaTech"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |title=Book reviews |accessdate=22 September 2011 |publisher=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |year=2011 |author=Virginia Polytechnic Institute and State University |work=Scholarly definition document |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110910082750/http://www.lib.vt.edu/find/byformat/bookreviews.html |archivedate=10 September 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

If a historical text discusses old documents to derive a new historical conclusion, it is considered to be a primary source for the new conclusion. Examples in which a source can be both primary and secondary include an obituary&lt;ref name=Duffin&gt;{{Cite book|last=Duffin|first=Jacalyn|title=History of Medicine: A Scandalously Short Introduction|url=https://books.google.com/?id=__oDQ6yDO7kC&amp;pg=PA366&amp;dq=%22secondary+source%22+historiography|year=1999|publisher=University of Toronto Press|isbn=0-8020-7912-1|page=366|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; or a survey of several volumes of a journal counting the frequency of articles on a certain topic.&lt;ref name=Duffin/&gt;

Whether a source is regarded as primary or secondary in a given context may change, depending upon the present state of knowledge within the field.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Henige|first=David|title=Primary Source by Primary Source? On the Role of Epidemics in New World Depopulation|journal=Ethnohistory|volume=33|issue=3|year=1986|pages=292–312, at 292|doi=10.2307/481816|jstor=481816|publisher=Ethnohistory, Vol. 33, No. 3|quote=[T]he term 'primary' inevitably carries a relative meaning insofar as it defines those pieces of information that stand in closest relationship to an event or process ''in the present state of our knowledge''. Indeed, in most instances the very nature of a primary source tells us that it is actually derivative.…[H]istorians have no choice but to regard certain of the available sources as 'primary' since they are as near to truly original sources as they can now secure|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, if a document refers to the contents of a previous but undiscovered letter, that document may be considered "primary", since it is the closest known thing to an original source; but if the letter is later found, it may then be considered "secondary"&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Henige|1986|p=292}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some instances, the reason for identifying a text as the "primary source" may devolve from the fact that no copy of the original source material exists, or that it is the oldest extant source for the information cited.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|last1=Ambraseys|first1=Nicholas|last2=Melville|first2=Charles Peter|last3=Adams|first3=Robin Dartrey|title=The Seismicity of Egypt, Arabia, and the Red Sea|year=1994|isbn=0-521-39120-2|publisher=Cambridge University Press|url=https://books.google.com/?id=dtVqdSKnBq4C&amp;pg=PA7&amp;dq=historiography+%22primary+source%22+%22secondary+source%22|page=7|quote=The same chronicle can be a primary source for the period contemporary with the author, a secondary source for earlier material derived from previous works, but also a primary source when these earlier works have not survived|ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Forgeries==
Historians must occasionally contend with forged documents that purport to be primary sources. These forgeries have usually been constructed with a fraudulent purpose, such as promulgating legal rights, supporting false pedigrees, or promoting particular interpretations of historic events. The investigation of documents to determine their authenticity is called [[diplomatics]].

For centuries, [[Pope]]s used the forged [[Donation of Constantine]] to bolster the Papacy's secular power. Among the earliest forgeries are false [[Anglo-Saxon charters]], a number of 11th- and 12th-century forgeries produced by [[monastery|monasteries]] and [[abbey]]s to support a claim to land where the original document had been lost or never existed. One particularly unusual forgery of a primary source was perpetrated by [[Sir Edward Dering, 1st Baronet|Sir Edward Dering]], who placed false [[monumental brass]]es in a [[parish church]].&lt;ref&gt;Everyone has Roots: An Introduction to English Genealogy by Anthony J. Camp, published by Genealogical Pub. Co., 1978&lt;/ref&gt; In 1986, [[Hugh Trevor-Roper]] "authenticated" the [[Hitler Diaries]], which were later proved to be forgeries. Recently, forged documents have been placed within the [[The National Archives (United Kingdom)#Forgeries discovered in 2005|UK National Archives]] in the hope of establishing a false [[provenance]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title=Introduction to record class R4|url= http://discovery.nationalarchives.gov.uk/details/r/C16525|publisher=The National Archives|accessdate=8 March 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|last=Leppard| first=David|title=Forgeries revealed in the National Archives – Times Online|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/uk/article3867853.ece|work=The Sunday Times|date=4 May 2008|accessdate=4 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, historians dealing with recent centuries rarely encounter forgeries of any importance.&lt;ref name=Handlin&gt;[[Oscar Handlin]] and [[Arthur Meier Schlesinger]], ''Harvard Guide to American History'' (1954)&lt;/ref&gt;{{rp|22–25}}

The '''Rashidun army''' was the core of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]]'s armed forces during the [[Muslim conquests]] of the 7th century, serving alongside the [[Rashidun navy]]. The Rashidun army maintained a high level of discipline, strategic prowess and organization.&lt;ref&gt;Britain and the Arabs: Contributors: JB Glubb - author. Publisher: Hodder and Staughton. Place of Publication: London. Publication Year: 1959. Page Number:34&lt;/ref&gt;

In its time, the Rashidun army was a powerful and very effective force. The size of the Rashidun army was initially 13,000 men in 632, but as the Caliphate expanded, the army gradually grew to 100,000 men by 657. The three most successful generals of the Rashidun army were [[Khalid ibn al-Walid]], who [[Muslim conquest of Persia|conquered Persian Mesopotamia]]  and [[Abu Ubaidah ibn al-Jarrah]] who [[Muslim conquest of Syria|conquered Roman Syria]], and [['Amr ibn al-'As]], who [[Muslim conquest of Egypt|conquered Roman Egypt]].

==Army==
Only Muslims were allowed to join the Rashidun army as regular soldiers. During the [[Ridda wars]] in the reign of Caliph [[Abu Bakr]], the army mainly consisted of the corps from [[Medina]], [[Mecca]] and [[Taif]].  Later on during the [[Islamic conquest of Persia|conquest of Iraq]] in 633 many [[bedouin]] corps were recruited as regular soldiers. During the Islamic conquest of Sassanid Persia (633-656), some 12,000 elite [[Persian people|Persian]] soldiers converted to Islam and served later on during the invasion of the empire. During the Muslim conquest of [[Roman Syria]] (633-638,) some 4,000 [[Greek people|Greek]] Byzantine soldiers under their commander Joachim (later Abdullah Joachim) converted to Islam and served as regular troops in the conquest of both [[Anatolia]] and [[Egypt]]. During the conquest of Egypt (641-644), [[Copts|Coptic]] converts to Islam were recruited. During the conquest of [[North Africa]], [[Berber people|Berber]] converts to Islam were recruited as regular troops, who later made the bulk of the Rashidun army and later the Umayyad army in Africa.

===Infantry===
Rashidun army relied heavily on their [[infantry]]. ''[[Mubarizun]]'' were a special part of the Muslim army, composed of the champions. Their role was to undermine the enemy morale by slaying their champions. The infantry would make repeated charges and withdrawals known as ''karr wa farr'', using spears and swords combined with arrow volleys to weaken the enemies and wear them out. However, the main energy had to still be conserved for a counterattack, supported by a cavalry charge, that would make flanking or encircling movements.
Defensively, the [[Muslim]] [[spear]]man with their two and a half meter long spears would close ranks, forming a protective wall (''Tabi'a'') for [[archery|archers]] to continue their fire. This close formation stood its ground remarkably well in the first four days of defence in the [[Battle of Yarmouk]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.militaryhistoryonline.com/muslimwars/articles/yarmuk.aspx Military History Online&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Cavalry===
{{see also|Mobile guard}}

The Rashidun cavalry was one of the most successful [[light cavalry]] forces, provided it was competently led.  It was armed with lances and swords. Initially, the cavalry was used as a reserve force, with its main role being to attack the enemy once they were weakened by the repeated charges of the infantry. The cavalry would then make flanking or encircling movements against the enemy army, either from the flanks or straight from the center, most likely using a wedge-shaped formation in its attack.
Some of the best examples of the use of the cavalry force occurred under the command of Khalid ibn Walid in the [[Battle of Walaja]] against the [[Sassanid]] [[Persian Empire|Persians]] and in the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] against the [[Byzantine]]s. In both cases the cavalry regiments were initially stationed behind the flanks and center.
The proportion of cavalry within the Rashidun forces were initially limited to less than 20% due to the inability of the poor economic condition and arid climate of the Arabian Peninsula to support large numbers of warhorses.  As the wealthy lands of the [[Near East]] were conquered, many Arab warriors acquired horses as [[war loot|booty]] or tribute, so that by the end of the Rashidun period half of the "Jund" forces were composed of cavalry.  
[[Mounted archery]] was initially not used by the Rashidun cavalry unlike their Byzantine and Persian opponents, this not being a traditional Arab fighting method.  As the conquest of Persia progressed, some [[Sassanid]] gentry converted into Islam and joined the [[Rashidun]] cause; these "[[Asawira]]" were very highly regarded due to their skill as heavy cavalrymen as well as mounted archers.

==Weaponry==
Reconstructing the military equipment of early Muslim armies is problematic. Compared with Roman armies—or, indeed, later medieval Muslim armies—the range of visual representation is very small, often imprecise and difficult to date. Physically very little material evidence has survived and again, much of it is difficult to date.&lt;ref&gt;The Armies of the Caliphs: Military and Society in the Early Islamic State. Contributors: Hugh Kennedy - author. Publisher: Routledge. Place of Publication: London. Publication Year: 2001. Page Number:168&lt;/ref&gt;

===Helmets===
Muslim headgear included gilded helmets—both pointed and rounded—similar to that of the silver helmets of the Sassanid Empire. The rounded helmet, referred to as ‘’Baidah’’ ("Egg"), was a standard early Byzantine type composed of two pieces. The pointed helmet was a segmented Central Asian type known as ‘’Tarikah’’. [[Mail (armour)|Mail armour]] was commonly used to protect the face and neck, either as an [[aventail]] from the helmet or as a mail coif like how it was used by Romano-Byzantine armies since 5th century. The face was often half covered with the tail of a turban that also served as protection against the strong desert winds.

===Armour===
Hardened leather scale or lamellar armour was produced in Yemen, Iraq and along the Persian gulf coast. Mail armour was preferred and became more common later during the conquest of neighbouring empires, often being captured as part of the [[war loot|booty]]. It was known as ''Dir,'' and was opened part-way down the chest. To avoid rusting it was polished and stored in a mixture of dust and oil.&lt;ref&gt;Yarmouk 636, Conquest of Syria by David Nicolle&lt;/ref&gt;
Infantry soldiers were more heavily armoured than horsemen.

===Shields===
Large wooden or [[wickerwork]] [[shield]]s were in use, but most shields were made of leather. For this purpose, the hides of camels and cows was used and it would be anointed, a practice since ancient Hebrew times.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.questia.com/reader/action/gotoDocId/102802943 title&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; During the invasion of the Levant, Byzantine soldiers extensively used elephant hide shields, which were probably captured and used by the Rashidun army.

===Spears===
Long spears were locally made with the reeds of the Persian gulf coast. The reeds were similar to that of bamboo.

===Swords===
The sword was the most prestigious weapon of the early Muslims. High quality swords were made in [[Yemen]] from Indian ''[[wootz]]'' steel.,&lt;ref&gt;Augus Mcbride&lt;/ref&gt; while inferior swords were made throughout Arabia. Both the short Arab swords (similar to the Roman [[gladius]]) and [[Sassanid]] long swords were used and Rashidun horsemen as well as foot soldiers were often described as carrying both at the same time.
All swords hung from a [[baldric]].
Another personal weapon was the dagger, a weapon used only as a last resort.

===Bows===
Bows were locally made in various parts of Arabia; the most typical were the hijazi bows. It could be one piece of wood or two pieces joined together back to back. The maximum useful range of the traditional Arabian bow used to be about 150 meters. Early Muslim archers were infantry archers.

===Siege weaponry===
[[Catapult]]s were used extensively in siege operations. Under [[Caliph]] [[Umar]] siege towers, called [[siege tower|Dababah]] were also employed. These wooden towers moved on wheels and were several stories tall. They were driven up to the foot of the besieged fortification and then the walls were pierced with a battering ram. [[Archery|Archers]] guarded the ram and the soldiers who moved it.

==Organization of army as a state department==
[[Caliph]] [[Umar]] was the first [[Muslim]] ruler to organize the army as a state department. This reform was introduced in 637 [[AD]] A beginning was made with the [[Quraysh (tribe)|Quraish]] and the [[Ansar (Islam)|Ansars]] and the system was gradually extended to the whole of [[Arabia]] and to Muslims of conquered lands. A register of all adults who could be called to war was prepared, and a scale of salaries was fixed. 
All registered men were liable for military service. They were divided into two categories, namely: 
# Those who formed the regular standing army; and
#Those that lived in their homes, but were liable to be called to the colors whenever needed.

The pay was given in the beginning of the month of [[Muharram]]. The [[allowance (money)|allowance]]s were paid during the harvesting season.
The armies of the Caliphs were mostly paid in cash salaries. In contrast to many post-Roman polities in Europe, grants of land, or rights to collect taxes directly from the people within one's grant of land, were of only minor importance. A major consequence of this was that the army directly depended on the state for its subsistence which, in turn, meant that the military had to control the state apparatus.&lt;ref&gt;The Armies of the Caliphs: Military and Society in the Early Islamic State.

==Movement==
When the army was on the march, it always halted on Fridays. When on march, the day's march was never allowed to be so long as to tire out the troops. The stages were selected with reference to the availability of water and other provisions. The advance was led by an advance guard consisting of a regiment or more.  Then came the main body of the army, and this was followed by the women and children and the baggage loaded on camels. At the end of the column moved the rear guard. On long marches the horses were led; but if there was any danger of enemy interference on the march, the horses were mounted, and the cavalry thus formed would act either as the advance guard or the rearguard or move wide on a [[Flanking maneuver|flank]], depending on the direction from which the greatest danger loomed.

When on march the army was divided into:

*''Muqaddima'' (مقدمة) - "the vanguard"
*''Qalb'' (قلب) - "the center"
*''Al-khalf'' (الخلف) - "the rear"
*''Al-mu'akhira'' (المؤخرة) - "the rearguard"

==Divisions in battle==
The army was organized on the [[Decimal|decimal system]].&lt;ref&gt;Tabari: Vol. 3, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

On the battlefield the army was divided into sections. These sections were: 
*''Qalb'' (قلب) - "the center"
*''Maymana'' (ميمنه) - "the [[right wing]]"
*''Maysara'' (ميسرة) - "the [[left wing]]"

Each section was under a commander and was at a distance of about 150 meters from each other. Every tribal unit had its leader called ''arifs''. In such units, there were commanders for each 10, 100 and 1,000 men, the latter-most corresponding to [[regiments]].  The grouping of regiments to form larger forces was flexible, varying with the situation. ''Arifs'' were grouped and each group was under a commander called ''amir al-ashar'' and ''amir al-ashars'' were under the command of a section commander, who were under the command of the commander in chief, ''amir al-jaysh''.

Other components of the army were: 
*''Rijal'' (رجال) - "[[infantry]]"
*''Fursan'' (فرسان) - "[[cavalry]]"
*''Rumat'' (رماة) - "[[Archery|archers]]"
*''Tali'ah'' (طليعة) - "patrols", who kept watch over enemy movements
# '''Rukban'' (ركبان) - "[[camel]] corps"
# '''Nuhhab al-mu'an'' (نهّاب المؤن) - "[[foraging]] parties"

==Intelligence and espionage==
It was one of the most highly developed departments of the army which proved helpful in most of the campaigns.  The [[espionage]] ('''جاسوسية''') and [[intelligence service]]s were first organised by Muslim general [[Khalid ibn Walid]] during his [[Islamic conquest of Persia|campaign to Iraq]].&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Kathir, Al-Bidayah wan-Nihayah, Dar Abi Hayyan, [[Cairo]], 1st ed. 1416/1996, Vol. 6 P. 425.&lt;/ref&gt; Later, when he was transferred to the [[Syria]]n front he organized the [[espionage]] department there as well.&lt;ref&gt;al-Waqdi ''Fatuh-al-sham'' page 61&lt;/ref&gt;

==Strategy==
{{details|topic=Mubarizun|Mobile guard}}

The basic strategy of early Muslim armies setting out to conquer foreign land was to exploit every possible drawback of the enemy army in order to achieve victory with minimum losses as the Rashidun army, quality-wise and strength-wise, was sub-standard to the [[Sassanid army|Sassanid Persian army]] and the [[Byzantine army]].  [[Khalid ibn Walid]], the first Muslim general of the [[Rashidun Caliphate]] to conduct a conquest in foreign land, during his campaign against the [[Sassanid]] [[Persian Empire]] (''Iraq 633 - 634'') and [[Byzantine Empire]] (''Syria 634 - 638'') developed brilliant tactics that he used effectively against both the [[Sassanid army]] and the Byzantine army. The main drawback of the armies of Sassanid Persian Empire and the [[Eastern Roman Empire]] was their lack of mobility.&lt;ref name="I. Akram 1970"&gt;A. I. Akram (1970).  The Sword of Allah: Khalid bin al-Waleed, His Life and Campaigns. National Publishing House, Rawalpindi. {{ISBN|0-7101-0104-X}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Khalid ibn Walid decided to use the mobility of his own army to exploit the lack thereof in the Sassanid army and [[Byzantine army]]. Later the same strategy was adopted by all other Muslim generals throughout the period of military expansion. Though only part of the Rashidun army was actual [[cavalry]], the entire army was [[camel]] mounted for movement. [[Khalid ibn Walid]] and then later [[List of Muslim soldiers|Muslim generals]] were also able to make use of the fine fighting quality of the Muslim soldiers, the bulk of whom were [[bedouin]]s and adept in swordsmanship.

The Muslims' light cavalry during the later years of the [[Muslim conquest of Syria|Islamic conquest of Levant]] became the most powerful section of the army. The best use of this lightly armed and fast moving cavalry was revealed at the [[Battle of Yarmouk]] (636 A.D) in which Khalid ibn Walid, knowing the importance and ability of his cavalry, used them to turn the tables at every critical instance of the battle with their ability to engage and disengage and turn back and attack again from the flank or rear. A strong cavalry regiment was formed by Khalid ibn Walid which included the veterans of the [[Islamic conquest of Persia|campaign in Iraq]] and Syria. Early Muslim historians have given it the name '''tulaiha mutaharrika''' ( متحرك طليعة ), or the ''mobile guard''. This was used as an advance guard and a strong striking force to route the opposing armies with its greater mobility that gave it an upper hand when maneuvering against any [[Byzantine army]]. With this mobile striking force, the conquest of Syria was made easy.&lt;ref&gt;Annals of the Early Caliphate By William Muir&lt;/ref&gt;

Another remarkable strategy developed by Al-Muthanna and later followed by other Muslim generals was not moving far from the desert so long as there were opposing forces within striking distance of its rear. The idea was to fight the battles close to the desert, with safe escape routes open in case of defeat.&lt;ref&gt;Tabari: Vol: 2, page no: 560.&lt;/ref&gt; The desert was not only a haven of security into which the [[Sassanid army]] and [[Byzantine army]] would not venture, but also a region of free, fast movement in which their camel mounted troops could move easily and rapidly to any destination that they chose. Following this same strategy during the conquest of Iraq and Syria, [[Khalid ibn Walid]] did not engage his army deep into Iraq and Syria until the opposing army had lost its ability to threaten his routes to the desert.  Another possible advantage of always keeping a desert at the rear was easy communication and reinforcement.

Once the Byzantines were weakened and the Sassanids effectively destroyed, the later Rashidun generals were free to use any strategy and tactics to overpower the opposing forces but they mainly relied on the mobility of their troops to prevent the concentration of enemy troops in large numbers.&lt;ref name="I. Akram 1970"/&gt;

==Conduct and ethics==
{{Main|Islamic military jurisprudence}}

The basic principle in the [[Qur'an]] for fighting is that other communities should be treated as one's own. Fighting is justified for legitimate [[self-defense]], to aid other Muslims and after a violation of the terms of a treaty, but should be stopped if these circumstances cease to exist.&lt;ref name="Crone"&gt;Patricia Crone, [[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]], War article, p.456. [[Brill Publishers]]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Micheline R. Ishay, ''The History of Human Rights: From Ancient Times to the Globalization Era'', [[University of California Press]], p.45&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Boundries_Princeton"&gt;Sohail H. Hashmi, David Miller, ''Boundaries and Justice: diverse ethical perspectives'', [[Princeton University Press]], p.197&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Douglas M. Johnston, ''Faith-Based Diplomacy: Trumping Realpolitik'', [[Oxford University Press]], p.48&lt;/ref&gt; During his life, [[Muhammad]] gave various injunctions to his forces and adopted practices toward the [[Laws of war|conduct of war]]. The most important of these were summarized by Muhammad's companion, [[Abu Bakr]], in the form of ten rules for the Rashidun army:&lt;ref&gt;Aboul-Enein and Zuhur, p. 22&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|Stop, O people, that I may give you ten rules for your guidance in the battlefield. Do not commit treachery or deviate from the right path. You must not mutilate dead bodies. Neither kill a child, nor a woman, nor an aged man. Bring no harm to the trees, nor burn them with fire, especially those which are fruitful. Slay not any of the enemy's flock, save for your food. You are likely to pass by people who have devoted their lives to monastic services; leave them alone.}}

These injunctions were honored by the second [[caliph]], [[Umar]], during whose reign (634–644) important [[Muslim conquests]] took place.&lt;ref&gt;Nadvi(2000), pg. 519&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, during the [[Battle of Siffin]], the caliph [[Ali]] stated that Islam does not permit Muslims to stop the supply of water to their enemy.&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopaedia of Islam (2005), p.204&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the [[Rashidun Caliphate|Rashidun Caliphs]], [[hadith]]s attributed to Muhammad himself suggest that he stated the following regarding the [[Muslim conquest of Egypt]]:&lt;ref name=Daly-18&gt;{{citation|title=Egyptology: The Missing Millennium : Ancient Egypt in Medieval Arabic Writings|first=Okasha|last=El Daly|publisher=[[Routledge]]|year=2004|isbn=1-84472-063-2|page=18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Spanish American wars of independence''' were the numerous wars against [[Spanish Empire|Spanish rule]] in [[Hispanic America|Spanish America]] with the aim of political independence that took place during the early 19th century, after the [[Peninsular War|French invasion of Spain]] during Europe's [[Napoleonic Wars]]. Although there has been research on the idea of a separate Spanish American ("creole") identity separate from that of Iberia,&lt;ref&gt;D.A. Brading, ''The First America: The Spanish Monarchy, Creole Patriots, and Liberalism, 1492-1866''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 1993&lt;/ref&gt; political independence was not initially the aim of most Spanish Americans, nor was it necessarily inevitable.&lt;ref&gt;Brian Hamnett, ''The End of Iberian Rule on the American Continent, 1770-1830''. Cambridge: Cambridge University Press 2017.&lt;/ref&gt; After the restoration of rule by Ferdinand VII in 1814, and his rejection of the Spanish liberal constitution of 1812, the monarchy as well as liberals hardened their stance toward its overseas possessions, and they in turn increasingly sought political independence.&lt;ref&gt;Timothy Anna,"Review", [[American Historical Review]] vol. 123 (3) 2018, pp. 985-86.&lt;/ref&gt;

The violent conflicts started in 1809 with short-lived [[junta (Peninsular War)|governing junta]]s established in [[Chuquisaca Revolution|Chuquisaca]] and [[Quito#Colony|Quito]] in opposing the government of the [[Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom|Supreme Central Junta of Seville]]. In 1810, [[Retroversion of the sovereignty to the people|numerous new juntas]] appeared across the Spanish domains in the Americas when the Central Junta fell to the French invasion. Although various regions of Spanish America objected to many crown policies, "there was little interest in outright independence; indeed there was widespread support for the Spanish Central Junta formed to lead the resistance against the French."&lt;ref&gt;David Bushnell, " Wars of Independence: South America" in ''The Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 5, p. 446. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; While some Spanish Americans believed that independence was necessary, most who initially supported the creation of the new governments saw them as a means to preserve the region's autonomy from the French. Over the course of the next decade, the political instability in Spain and the [[History of Spain (1814–73)#Reaction (1814–20)|absolutist restoration]] under Ferdinand VII convinced many Spanish Americans of the need to formally establish independence from the [[metropole|mother country]].

These conflicts were fought both as [[irregular warfare]] and [[conventional warfare]], and as [[wars of national liberation]] and [[civil war]]s. The conflicts among the colonies and with Spain eventually resulted in a chain of newly independent countries stretching from Argentina and Chile in the south to Mexico in the north in the first third of the 19th century. Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under [[Spain under the Restoration|Spanish rule]] until the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898. The new republics from the beginning abolished the formal system of racial classification and hierarchy, [[Casta|casta system]], the [[Inquisition]], and noble titles. Slavery was not abolished immediately but ended in all of the new nations within a quarter century. [[Criollo people|Criollos]] (those of Spanish descent born in the New World) and [[mestizo]]s (those of mixed American Indian and Spanish blood or culture) replaced [[Peninsulars|Spanish-born]] appointees in most political governments. Criollos remained at the top of a social structure that retained some of its traditional features culturally, if not legally. For almost a century thereafter, [[Liberalism and conservatism in Latin America|conservatives and liberals]] fought to reverse or to deepen the social and political changes unleashed by those rebellions.

The events in Spanish America were related to the [[war of independence|wars of independence]] in the former French colony of St-Domingue, [[Haiti]], and the transition to independence in Brazil. [[Independence of Brazil|Brazil's independence]], in particular, shared a common starting point with that of Spanish America, since both conflicts were triggered by Napoleon's invasion of the Iberian Peninsula, which forced the Portuguese royal family [[Transfer of the Portuguese Court to Brazil|to flee to Brazil]] in 1807. The process of Latin American independence took place in the general political and intellectual climate that emerged from the [[Age of Enlightenment]] and that influenced all of the [[Atlantic Revolutions]], including the earlier revolutions in the [[American Revolution|United States]] and [[French Revolution|France]]. A more direct cause of the Spanish American wars of independence were the unique developments occurring within the [[History of Spain (1814–73)|Kingdom of Spain]] and its [[monarchy of Spain|monarchy]] during this era.

Political independence was not necessarily the foreordained outcome of the political turmoil in Spanish America. "There was little interest in outright independence."&lt;ref&gt;[[David Bushnell]], "Wars of Independence: South America" in ''The Encyclopedia of Latin American History and Culture'', vol. 5, p. 446. New York: Charles Scribner's Sons 1996.&lt;/ref&gt; As historians [[Robin Humphreys|R.A. Humphreys]] and John Lynch note, "it is all too easy to equate the forces of discontent or even the forces of change with the forces of revolution."&lt;ref&gt;R.A. Humphreys and John Lynch, "Introduction", ''The Origins of the Latin American Revolutions, 1808-1826''. New York: Alfred A. Knopf 1965, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;  Since "by definition, there was no history of independence until it happened,"&lt;ref&gt;[[Jeremy Adelman]], "Independence in Latin America" in ''The Oxford Handbook of Latin American History'', José C. Moya, ed. New York: Oxford University Press 2011, p. 154.&lt;/ref&gt; when Spanish American independence did occur, explanations for why it came about have been sought.

There are a number of factors that have been identified. First, increasing control by the Crown of its overseas empire via the [[Bourbon Reforms]] of the mid-eighteenth century introduced changes to the relationship of Spanish Americans to the Crown. The language used to describe the overseas empire shifted from "kingdoms" with independent standing with the crown to "colonies" subordinate to Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Burkholder,(2016) "Spain’s America: from kingdoms to colonies, ''Colonial Latin American Review'', 25:2, 125-153, DOI: 10.1080/10609164.2016.1205241&lt;/ref&gt; In an effort to better control the administration and economy of the overseas possessions the Crown reintroduced the practice of appointing outsiders, almost all ''[[peninsulars]]'', to the royal offices throughout the empire. This meant that Spanish American elites were thwarted in their expectations and ambitions by the crown's upending of long-standing practices of creole access to office holding.&lt;ref&gt;Mark A. Burkholder and D.S. Chandler, ''From Impotence to Authority: The Spanish Crown and the American Audiencias, 1687-1808''. Columbia: University of Missouri Press 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

The regalist and secularizing policies of the Bourbon monarchy were aimed at decreasing the power of the Roman Catholic Church. The crown had already [[expulsion of the Jesuits|expelled the Jesuits]] in 1767, which saw many creole members of the Society of Jesus go into permanent exile. Later in the eighteenth century the crown sought to decrease the privileges (''fueros'') of the clergy, restricting clerical authority to spiritual matters and undermining the power of parish priests, who often acted as agents of the crown in rural parishes.&lt;ref&gt;[[Nancy Farriss]], ''Crown and Clergy in Colonial Mexico, 1759-1821''. London: Athlone Press 1968.&lt;/ref&gt;  By desacralizing power and frontal attacks on the clergy, the crown, according to [[William B. Taylor (historian)|William B. Taylor]], undermined its own legitimacy, since parish priests had been traditionally the "natural local representatives of their Catholic king."&lt;ref&gt;William B. Taylor, "Early Latin American Social History" in ''Reliving the Past: The Worlds of Social History''. Chapel Hill: University of North Carolina Press 1985, p. 149.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the economic sphere, the crown sought to gain control over church revenues. In a financial crisis of 1804, the crown attempted to call in debts owed the church, mainly in the form of mortgages for [[hacienda]]s owned by the elites. The Act of Consolidation simultaneously threatened the wealth of the church, whose capital was mainly lent for mortgages, as well as threatening the financial well-being of elites, who depended on mortgages for acquiring and keeping their estates.  Shortening the repayment period meant many elites were faced with bankruptcy.&lt;ref&gt;Margaret Chowning, "The ''Consolidación de Vales Reales'' in the Bishopric of Michoacán." ''Hispanic American Historical Review'' 69:3 (1989) 451-78.&lt;/ref&gt; The crown also sought to gain access to benefices elite families set aside to support a priest, often their own family members, by eliminating these endowed funds (''capellanías'') that the lower clergy depended on disproportionately.&lt;ref&gt;Michael P. Costeloe, ''Church Wealth in Mexico: A Study of the "Juzgado de Capellanías" in the Archbishopric of Mexico, 1800–1856.'' Cambridge University Press 1967.&lt;/ref&gt;  Prominently in Mexico, lower clergy participated in the insurgency for independence with priests [[Miguel Hidalgo]] and [[José María Morelos]].

The reforms had mixed results. In some areas—such as [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]], [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|Río de la Plata]] and [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]]—the reforms had positive effects, improving the local economy and the efficiency of the government.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''The Spanish American Revolutions'', 17–19, 334–335. Rodríguez, ''The Independence of Spanish America'', 19–27. Kinsbruner,  ''Independence in Spanish America'', 7–12.&lt;/ref&gt;   In other areas, the changes in the crown's economic and administrative policies led to tensions with locals, which at times erupted into open revolts, such as the [[Revolt of the Comuneros (New Granada)|Revolt of the Comuneros]] in [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]] and the [[Rebellion of Túpac Amaru II]] in [[Viceroyalty of Peru|Peru]].

The loss of high offices to Criollos and the eighteenth-century revolts in Spanish South America were the direct causes of the wars of independence, which took place decades later, but they have been considered important elements of the political background in which the wars took place.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 5–17. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 24–25. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 12–14, 17–32.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other factors may include [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]] thinking and the examples of the Atlantic Revolutions. The Enlightenment spurred the desire for social and economic reform to spread throughout Spanish America and the Iberian Peninsula. Ideas about free trade and [[Physiocracy|physiocratic economics]] were raised by the [[Enlightenment in Spain]] and spread to the overseas empire and a homegrown [[Spanish American Enlightenment]]. The political reforms implemented and the many constitutions written both in Spain and throughout the Spanish world during the wars of independence were influenced by these factors.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 27–34. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 14–18. Kinsbruner,  ''Independence in Spanish America'', 14–17, 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Creation of new ruling institutions in Spain and Americas, 1808–1810 ==

===Collapse of the Bourbon dynasty===
{{Main article|Abdications of Bayonne|Kingdom of Spain (Napoleonic)|Peninsular War}}

The Peninsular War was the trigger for conflicts in Spanish America in the absence of a legitimate monarch. The Peninsular War began an extended period of instability in the worldwide Spanish monarchy that lasted until 1823. Napoleon's capture of the Bourbon monarchs precipitated a political crisis in Spain and Spanish America. Although the Spanish world almost uniformly rejected Napoleon's plan to place his brother, [[Joseph Bonaparte|Joseph]], on the throne, there was no clear solution to the lack of a king. Following traditional Spanish political theories on the contractual nature of the monarchy (see [[Francisco Suárez#Philosophy of law|Philosophy of Law of Francisco Suárez]]), the peninsular provinces responded to the crisis by establishing [[Junta (Peninsular War)|juntas]].&lt;ref&gt;William Spence Robertson,  "The Juntas of 1808 and the Spanish Colonies," ''English Historical Review'' (1916) 31#124 pp. 573–585 [https://www.jstor.org/stable/551442 in JSTOR]&lt;/ref&gt;  The move, however, led to more confusion, since there was no central authority and most juntas did not recognize the claim of some juntas to represent the monarchy as a whole. The Junta of Seville, in particular, claimed authority over the overseas empire, because of the province's historic role as the exclusive [[entrepôt]] of the empire.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 36–37. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 51–56, 58–59. Kinsbruner,  ''Independence in Spanish America'', 12, 35–37.&lt;/ref&gt;

This impasse was resolved through negotiations between the several juntas in Spain counted with the participation of the [[Council of Castile]], which led to the creation of a main government: the "[[Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom (Spain)|Supreme Central and Governmental Junta of Spain and the Indies]]" on September 25, 1808. It was agreed that the kingdoms of the peninsula would send two representatives to this Supreme Central Junta, and that the overseas kingdoms would send one representative each. These kingdoms were defined as "the [[Viceroyalty|viceroyalties]] of [[Viceroyalty of New Spain|New Spain]] (Mexico), [[Viceroyalty of Perú|Peru]], [[Viceroyalty of New Granada|New Granada]], and [[Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata|Buenos Aires]], and the independent [[Captaincy general|captaincies general]] of the island of [[Captaincy General of Cuba|Cuba]], [[Captaincy General of Puerto Rico|Puerto Rico]], [[Captaincy General of Guatemala|Guatemala]], [[Captaincy General of Chile|Chile]], Province of [[Venezuela Province|Venezuela]], and the [[Spanish East Indies|Philippines]]."&lt;ref&gt;Royal Order of the Central Junta of January 22, 1809, cited in Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 60.&lt;/ref&gt; This plan was criticized for providing unequal representation to Spanish America; nevertheless, throughout the end of 1808 and early 1809, the regional capitals elected candidates, whose names were forwarded to the capitals of the viceroyalties or captaincies general. Several important and large cities were left without direct representation in the Supreme Junta. In particular [[Quito]] and [[Sucre|Chuquisaca]], which saw themselves as the capitals of kingdoms, resented being subsumed in the larger [[Viceroyalty of Peru]].  This unrest led to the establishment of juntas in these cities in 1809, which were eventually quashed by the authorities within the year. An unsuccessful attempt at establishing a junta in New Spain was also stopped.

The escape to [[Cádiz]] and the dissolution of the Supreme Central Junta on January 29, 1810, because of the reverses suffered after the [[Battle of Ocaña]] by the Spanish forces paid with Spanish American money,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Batalla de Ocaña | work = Bicentenario de las independencias iberoaméricanas | publisher = Ministerio de Educación, Cultura y Deporte (Spain) | url = http://pares.mcu.es/Bicentenarios/portal/batallaOcana.html | accessdate = 2012-08-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; set off another wave of juntas being established in the Americas. French forces had taken over southern Spain and forced the Supreme Junta to seek [[Siege of Cádiz|refuge in the island-city of Cádiz]].

The Supreme Junta replaced itself with a smaller, five-man council, called the Regency, or the [[Supreme Central and Governing Junta of the Kingdom#The Council of Regency of Spain and the Indies|Council of Regency of Spain and the Indies]]. Next, in order to establish a more legitimate government system, the Regency called for the convening of an "extraordinary and general [[Cortes Generales|Cortes]] of the Spanish Nation": the "[[Cádiz Cortes]]". The plan for the election of the Cortes, based on provinces, and not kingdoms, was more equitable and provided more time to determine what would be considered an overseas province.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 50–52, 236–239.

===Response in Spanish America===
{{Main article|Retroversion of the sovereignty to the people|Junta (Spanish American Independence)|Chuquisaca Revolution|La Paz revolution|Luz de América}}

Most Spanish Americans saw no reason to recognize a rump government that was under the threat of being captured by the French at any moment, and began to work for the creation of [[Junta (Peninsular War)|local juntas]] to preserve the region's independence from the French. Junta movements were successful in New Granada (Colombia), [[First Republic of Venezuela|Venezuela]], [[Government Junta of Chile (1810)|Chile]] and [[Primera Junta|Río de la Plata]] (Argentina). Less successful, though serious movements, also occurred in [[1811 Independence Movement|Central America]]. Ultimately, Central America, along with most of New Spain, Quito (Ecuador), Peru, [[Upper Peru]] (Bolivia), the Caribbean and the Philippine Islands remained in control of royalists for the next decade and participated in the [[Cádiz Cortes|Spanish ''Cortes'']] effort to establish a liberal government for the Spanish Monarchy.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 43–45, 52–56, 132–133, 195–196, 239–240.

The creation of juntas in Spanish America, such as the ''[[Supreme Junta|Junta Suprema de Caracas]]'' on April 19, 1810, set the stage for the fighting that would afflict the region for the next decade and a half. Political fault lines appeared, and were often the causes of military conflict.  On the one hand the juntas challenged the authority of all royal officials, whether they recognized the Regency or not. On the other hand, royal officials and Spanish Americans who desired to keep the empire together were split between liberals, who supported the efforts of the Cortes, and conservatives (often called "[[Absolutism (European history)|absolutists]]" in the historiography), who did not want to see any innovations in government. Finally, although the juntas claimed to carry out their actions in the name of the deposed king, [[Ferdinand VII of Spain|Ferdinand VII]], their creation provided an opportunity for people who favored outright independence to promote their agenda publicly and safely. The proponents of independence called themselves [[Patriot (Spanish American Revolution)|patriots]], a term which eventually was generally applied to them.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 36–37, 134–135. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 52–53. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 45–46, 53.&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that independence was not the initial concern is evidenced by the fact that few areas declared independence in the years after 1810. The congresses of Venezuela and New Granada did so in 1811 and also Paraguay in same year (14 and 15 of May 1811). Some historians explain the reluctance to declare independence as a "mask of Ferdinand VII": that is, that patriot leaders felt that they needed to claim loyalty to the deposed monarch in order to prepare the masses for the radical change that full independence eventually would entail.&lt;ref&gt;The phrase is used by Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 56–58, 133. For a similar analysis without the phrase, see {{cite book | last = Crow| first = John A| title = The Epic of Latin America| publisher = Doubleday| year = 1946| location = Garden City, N.Y.| pages = 425–426}}&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, even areas such as Río de la Plata and Chile, which more or less maintained de facto independence from the peninsular authorities, did not declare independence until quite a few years later, in 1816 and 1818, respectively. Overall, despite achieving formal or de facto independence, many regions of Spanish America were marked by nearly continuous civil wars, which lasted well into the 1820s. In Mexico, where the junta movement had been stopped in its early stages by a coalition of Peninsular merchants and government officials, efforts to establish a government independent of the Regency or the French took the form of rebellion, under the leadership of [[Miguel Hidalgo y Costilla|Miguel Hidalgo]]. Hidalgo was captured and executed in 1811, but a resistance movement continued, which [[Solemn Act of the Declaration of Independence of Northern America|declared independence from Spain in 1813]]. In Central America, [[1811 Independence Movement|attempts at establishing juntas]] were also put down, but resulted in significantly less violence. The Caribbean islands, like the Philippines on the other side of the world, were relatively peaceful. Any plots to set up juntas were denounced to the authorities early enough to stop them before they gained widespread support.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 107–111, 134–137, 162–172, 195–200, 238–240, 313–319, 335. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 93–111, 115, 123–126, 136–144, 147–156, 164–165, 168, 176–177. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 46, 50, 52–53, 66–67, 100–101.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Major cities and regional rivalries===
{{Main article|Royalist (Spanish American independence)}}
[[File:LA BANDERA DE BOUCHARD.JPG|thumb|The [[Battle of San Lorenzo]] in 1813]]

Major cities and regional rivalry played an important role in the wars. The disappearance of a central, imperial authority—and in some cases of even a local, viceregal authority (as in the cases of New Granada and Río de la Plata)—initiated a prolonged period of [[balkanization]] in many regions of Spanish America. It was not clear which political units should replace the empire, and there were no new national identities to replace the traditional sense of being Spaniards. The original juntas of 1810 appealed first to a sense of being Spanish, which was counterposed to the French threat; second, to a general American identity, which was counterposed to the Peninsula lost to the French; and third, to a sense of belonging to the major cities or local province, the ''[[Fatherland|patria]]'' in Spanish.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 121, 131–132. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 13–19, 22,&lt;/ref&gt; More often than not, juntas sought to maintain a province's independence from the capital of the former viceroyalty or captaincy general as much as from the Peninsula itself. Armed conflicts broke out between the provinces over the question of whether some cities or provinces were to be subordinate to others as they had been under the crown. This phenomenon was particularly evident in South America. This rivalry also led some regions to adopt the opposite political cause to that chosen by their rivals. Peru seems to have remained strongly royalist in large part because of its rivalry with Río de la Plata, to which it had lost control of Upper Peru when the latter was elevated to a viceroyalty in 1776. The creation of juntas in Río de la Plata allowed Peru to regain formal control of Upper Peru for the duration of the wars.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 57–71, 162–163, 240–242. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 111–113, 126–136, 153–159, 176–179. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 53, 59.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Social and racial tensions===
[[File:ÉxododeCaracasen1814.jpg|thumb|Exodus from the town of Caracas 1814]]

Underlying social and racial tensions also had a great impact on the nature of the fighting. Rural areas were pitted against urban centers, as grievances against the authorities found an outlet in the political conflict. This was the case with Hidalgo's peasant revolt, which was fueled as much by discontent over several years of bad harvests as with events in the Peninsular War. Hidalgo was originally part of a circle of liberal urbanites in [[Querétaro, Querétaro|Querétaro]], who sought to establish a junta. After this conspiracy was discovered, Hidalgo turned to the rural people of the Mexican [[Bajío]] to build his army, and their interests soon overshadowed those of the urban intellectuals. A similar tension existed in Venezuela, where the Spanish immigrant [[José Tomás Boves]] formed a powerful, though irregular, royalist army out of the ''[[Llanero]]s'', mixed-race slave and plains people, by attacking the white landowning class. Boves and his followers often disregarded the command of Spanish officials and were not concerned with actually re-establishing the toppled royal government, choosing instead to keep real power among themselves. Finally, in the back country of [[Upper Peru]], the ''[[republiqueta]]s'' kept the idea of independence alive by allying with disenfranchised members of rural society and native groups, but were never able to take the major population centers.

Increasingly violent confrontations developed between Spaniards and Spanish Americans, but this tension was often related to class issues or fomented by patriot leaders to create a new sense of nationalism. After being incited to rid the country of the ''gachupines'' (a disparaging term for ''Peninsulares''), Hidalgo's forces indiscriminately massacred hundreds of Criollos and ''Peninsulares'' who had taken refuge at the [[Alhóndiga de Granaditas]] in Guanajuato. In Venezuela during his [[Admirable Campaign]], [[Simón Bolívar]] instituted a policy of a [[Decree of War to the Death|war to the death]], in which royalist Spanish Americans would be purposely spared but even neutral ''Peninsulares'' would be killed, in order to drive a wedge between the two groups. This policy laid the ground for the violent royalist reaction under Boves. Often though, royalism or patriotism simply provided a banner to organize the aggrieved, and the political causes could be discarded just as quickly as they were picked up. The Venezuelan ''Llaneros'' switched to the patriot banner once the elites and the urban centers became securely royalist after 1815, and it was the royal army in Mexico that ultimately brought about that nation's independence.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 118–121, 197–198, 200, 204–207, 306–313.

{{Republicanism sidebar}}

By 1815 the general outlines of which areas were controlled by royalists and pro-independence forces were established and a general stalemate set in the war. In areas where royalists controlled the main population centers, most of the fighting by those seeking independence was done by isolated [[Guerrilla warfare|guerrilla bands]]. In New Spain, the two main guerrilla groups were led by [[Guadalupe Victoria]] in Puebla and [[Vicente Guerrero]] in Oaxaca. In northern South America, New Granadan and Venezuelan patriots, under leaders such as [[Military career of Simón Bolívar|Simón Bolívar]], [[Francisco de Paula Santander]], [[Santiago Mariño]], [[Manuel Piar]] and [[José Antonio Páez]], carried out campaigns in the vast [[Orinoco|Orinoco River basin]] and along the Caribbean coast, often with material aid coming from [[Curaçao]] and [[Haiti]].  Also, as mentioned above, in Upper Peru, guerrilla bands controlled the isolated, rural parts of the country.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 168, 184, Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 70, 97.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Restoration of Ferdinand VII===

In March 1814, following with the collapse of the [[First French Empire]], Ferdinand VII was restored to the Spanish throne. This signified an important change, since most of the political and legal changes made on both sides of the Atlantic—the myriad of juntas, the Cortes in Spain and several of the congresses in the Americas, and many of the constitutions and new legal codes—had been made in his name. Before entering Spanish territory, Ferdinand made loose promises to the Cortes that he would uphold the Spanish Constitution. But once in Spain he realized that he had significant support from [[conservatism|conservatives]] in the general population and the hierarchy of the [[History of Roman Catholicism in Spain#19th century|Spanish Catholic Church]]; so, on May 4, he repudiated the Constitution and ordered the arrest of liberal leaders on May 10. Ferdinand justified his actions by stating that the Constitution and other changes had been made by a Cortes assembled in his absence and without his consent. He restored the former legal codes and political institutions and promised to convene a new Cortes under its traditional form (with separate chambers for the clergy and the nobility), a promise never fulfilled. News of the events arrived through Spanish America during the next three weeks to nine months, depending on time it took [[History of transport|goods and people to travel]] from Spain.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 169–172. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 56–57.&lt;/ref&gt;

Ferdinand's actions constituted a definitive de facto break both with the autonomous governments, which had not yet declared formal independence, and with the effort of Spanish liberals to create a representative government that would fully include the overseas possessions. Such a government was seen as an alternative to independence by many in New Spain, Central America, the Caribbean, Quito, Peru, Upper Peru and Chile. Yet the news of the restoration of the "[[Ancien Régime|ancien régime]]" did not initiate a new wave of juntas, as had happened in 1809 and 1810, with the notable exception of the establishment of a junta in [[Cusco|Cuzco]] demanding the implementation of the Spanish Constitution. Instead most Spanish Americans were moderates who decided to wait and see what would come out of the restoration of normalcy. In fact, in areas of New Spain, Central America and Quito, governors found it expedient to leave the elected constitutional ''[[Cabildo (council)|ayuntamientos]]'' in place for several years in order to prevent conflict with the local society.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 336. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 106.&lt;/ref&gt; Liberals on both sides of the Atlantic, nevertheless, continued to conspire to bring back a constitutional monarchy, ultimately succeeding in 1820. The most dramatic example of transatlantic collaboration is perhaps [[Francisco Javier Mina]]'s expedition to Texas and northern Mexico in 1816 and 1817.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 162. 171–172, 207. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 173–175, 192–194&lt;/ref&gt;

Spanish Americans in royalist areas who were committed to independence had already joined the guerrilla movements. However, Ferdinand's actions did set areas outside of the control of the crown on the path to full independence. The governments of these regions, which had their origins in the juntas of 1810, and even moderates there, who had entertained a reconciliation with the crown, now saw the need to separate from Spain if they were to protect the reforms they had enacted.

===Royalist military===
{{Main article|Spanish expeditionary army (Spanish American independence) order of battle}}
[[File:Batalla-Rancagua.jpg|thumb|The [[Battle of Rancagua]] in 1814]]

During this period, royalist forces made advances into New Granada, which they controlled from 1815 to 1819, and into Chile, which they controlled from 1814 to 1817. Except for royalist areas in the northeast and south, the provinces of New Granada had maintained independence from Spain since 1810, unlike neighboring Venezuela, where royalists and pro-independence forces had exchanged control of the region several times. To pacify Venezuela and to retake New Granada, Spain organized in 1815 the largest armed force it ever sent to the New World, consisting of 10,500 troops and nearly sixty ships.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 209. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 122. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 57.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Small contingents from Spain had been arriving in the Americas since 1810.  On August 25, 1810, a group of [[Spanish Navy Marines|Spanish Marines]] arrived in [[Veracruz]] from [[Cádiz]] on the [[frigate]], ''Nuestra señora de Atocha'' under the command of [[Rosendo Porlier y Asteguieta|Rosendo Porlier]] and accompanying Viceroy [[Francisco Javier Venegas]].  These were the first Spaniards to have come from Europe in support of [[royalist]]s. Frieyro de Lara. ''Guerra ejército y sociedad en el nacimiento de la España contemporánea''. (2009, Universidad de Granada) p. 660.&lt;/ref&gt; (See, [[Spanish reconquest of New Granada]].) Although this force was crucial in retaking a solidly pro-independence region like New Granada, its soldiers were eventually spread out throughout Venezuela, New Granada, Quito, and Peru and were lost to tropical diseases, diluting their impact on the war.&lt;ref&gt;Rebecca Earle, "'A Grave for Europeans'? Disease, Death, and the Spanish-American Revolutions" in Christon I. Archer, ed. ''The Wars of Independence in Spanish America'', 283–297.&lt;/ref&gt; More importantly, the majority of the royalist forces were composed, not of soldiers sent from the peninsula, but of Spanish Americans.

Overall, Europeans formed only about a tenth of the royalist armies in Spanish America, and only about half of the expeditionary units, once they were deployed in the Americas. Since each European soldier casualty was replaced by a Spanish American soldier, over time, there were more and more Spanish American soldiers in the expeditionary units. For example, [[Pablo Morillo]], commander in chief of the expeditionary force sent to South America, reported that he had only 2,000 European soldiers under his command in 1820; in other words, only half the soldiers of his expeditionary force were European. It is estimated that in the [[Battle of Maipú]] only a quarter of the royalist forces were European soldiers, in the [[Battle of Carabobo]] about a fifth, and in the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] less than 1% was European.

The American militias reflected the racial make-up of the local population. For example, in 1820 the royalist army in Venezuela had 843 white (''español''), 5,378 [[Casta]] and 980 [[Indigenous peoples of the Americas|Indigenous]] soldiers.

===Pro-independence advances===
{{Main article|Crossing of the Andes|Bolívar's campaign to liberate New Granada}}

Towards the end of this period the pro-independence forces made two important advances. In the [[Southern Cone]], a veteran of the Spanish army with experience in the Peninsular War, [[José de San Martín]], became the governor of the [[Province of Cuyo]]. He used this position to begin organizing an army as early as 1814 in preparation for an invasion of Chile. This was an important change in strategy after [[Army of the North|three United Provinces campaigns]] had been defeated in [[Upper Peru]]. San Martín's army became the nucleus of the [[Army of the Andes]], which received crucial political and material support in 1816 when [[Juan Martín de Pueyrredón]] became [[Supreme Director of the United Provinces of the Río de la Plata|Supreme Director]] of the [[United Provinces of South America|United Provinces]]. In January 1817, San Martín was finally ready to advance against the royalists in Chile. Ignoring an injunction from the congress of the Río de la Plata not to move against Chile, San Martín together with General [[Bernardo O'Higgins Riquelme]], later Supreme Director of Chile, led the Army over the Andes in a move that turned the tables on the royalists. By February 10, San Martín had control of northern and central Chile, and a year later, after a [[Guerra a muerte|war with no quarter]], the south. With the aid of a fleet under the command of former British naval officer [[Thomas Cochrane, 10th Earl of Dundonald|Thomas Cochrane]], Chile was secured from royalist control and independence was declared that year. San Martín and his allies spent the next two years planning an invasion of Peru, which began in 1820.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 138–141. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 179–182. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 72–75.&lt;/ref&gt;

In northern South America, after several failed campaigns to take Caracas and other urban centers of Venezuela, [[Simón Bolívar]] devised a similar plan in 1819 to cross the Andes and liberate New Granada from the royalists. Like San Martín, Bolívar personally undertook the efforts to create an army to invade a neighboring country, collaborated with pro-independence exiles from that region, and lacked the approval of the [[Congress of Angostura|Venezuelan congress]]. Unlike San Martín, however, Bolívar did not have a professionally trained army, but rather a quickly assembled mix of ''Llanero'' guerrillas, New Granadan exiles led by Santander and [[British Legions|British recruits]]. From June to July 1819, using the [[Wet season|rainy season]] as cover, Bolívar led his army across the flooded plains and over the cold, forbidding passes of the Andes, with heavy losses—a quarter of the British Legion perished, as well as many of his ''Llanero'' soldiers, who were not prepared for the nearly 4,000-meter altitudes—but the gamble paid off. By August Bolívar was in control of [[Bogotá]] and its treasury, and gained the support of many in New Granada, which still resented the harsh reconquest carried out under Morillo. Nevertheless, Santander found it necessary to continue the policy of the "war to the death" and carried out the execution of thirty-eight royalist officers who had surrendered. With the resources of New Granada, Bolívar became the undisputed leader of the patriots in Venezuela and orchestrated the union of the two regions in a new state called [[Gran Colombia|Colombia (Gran Colombia)]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 209–218. {{cite book | last = MacKenzie| first = S.

To counter the advances the pro-independence forces had made in South America, Spain prepared a second, large, expeditionary force in 1819. This force, however, never left Spain. Instead, it became the means by which liberals were finally able to reinstate a constitutional regime. On January 1, 1820, [[Rafael del Riego|Rafael Riego]], commander of the Asturias Battalion, headed a rebellion among the troops, demanding the return of the 1812 Constitution. His troops marched through the cities of [[Andalusia]] with the hope of extending the uprising to the civilian population, but locals were mostly indifferent. An uprising, however, did occur in [[Galicia (Spain)|Galicia]] in northern Spain, and from there it quickly spread throughout the country. On March 7, the royal palace in Madrid was surrounded by soldiers under the command of General [[Francisco Ballesteros]], and three days later, on March 10, the besieged Ferdinand VII, now a virtual prisoner, agreed to restore the Constitution.&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 194. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 88, 114, 120–121, 127–128.&lt;/ref&gt;

Riego's Revolt had two significant effects on the war in the Americas. Militarily, the large numbers of reinforcements, which were especially needed to retake New Granada and defend the Viceroyalty of Peru, would never arrive. Furthermore, as the royalists' situation became more desperate in region after region, the army experienced wholesale defections of units to the patriot side. Politically, the reinstitution of a liberal regime changed the terms under which the Spanish government sought to engage the insurgents. The new government naively assumed that the insurgents were fighting for Spanish liberalism and that the Spanish Constitution could still be the basis of reconciliation between the two sides. The government implemented the Constitution and held elections in the overseas provinces, just as in Spain. It also ordered military commanders to begin armistice negotiations with the insurgents with the promise that they could participate in the restored representative government.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 335–340. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 194–195. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 89.&lt;/ref&gt;

===New Spain and Central America===
{{Main article|First Mexican Empire|Federal Republic of Central America}}
{{History of New Spain}}

In effect, the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812]] adopted by the [[Cortes de Cadiz]] served as the basis for independence in New Spain and Central America, since in both regions it was a coalition of conservative and liberal royalist leaders who led the establishment of new states. The restoration of the Spanish Constitution and representative government was enthusiastically welcomed in New Spain and Central America. Elections were held, local governments formed and [[Deputy (legislator)|deputies]] sent to the Cortes. Among liberals, however, there was fear that the new regime would not last; and conservatives and the Church worried that the new liberal government would expand its reforms and anti-clerical legislation. This climate of instability created the conditions for the two sides to forge an alliance. This alliance coalesced towards the end of 1820 behind [[Agustín de Iturbide]], a [[colonel]] in the royal army, who at the time was assigned to destroy the guerrilla forces led by [[Vicente Guerrero]].&lt;ref&gt;Lynch analyzes the events through the older theory of a "conservative revolution": ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 319–320. Compare to Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 196–197, 199–205, 241–242. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 97–98. Peter F. Guardino, "The War of Independence in Guerrero, New Spain, 1808–1821" in Archer,  ''The Wars of Independence in Spanish America'', 122–124.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Abrazo de Acatempan.JPG|thumb|left|[[Vicente Guerrero]] and [[Agustín de Iturbide]] in the "Abrazo of Acatempan", when they agreed to combine forces to fight the royalist army. Oil painting by Román Sagredo, collection of the Museo Nacional de Historia, INAH, México).]]

In January 1821, Iturbide began peace negotiations with Guerrero, suggesting they unite to establish an independent New Spain. The simple terms that Iturbide proposed became the basis of the [[Plan of Iguala]]: the independence of New Spain (now to be called the Mexican Empire) with Ferdinand VII or another Bourbon as emperor; the retention of the Catholic Church as the official state religion and the protection of its [[Fuero|existing privileges]]; and the equality of all New Spaniards, whether immigrants or native-born. The following month the other important guerrilla leader, [[Guadalupe Victoria]], joined the alliance, and on March 1 Iturbide was proclaimed head of a new [[Army of the Three Guarantees]]. The representative of the new Spanish government, Superior Political Chief [[Juan O'Donojú]], who replaced the previous viceroys, arrived in [[Veracruz, Veracruz|Veracruz]] on July 1, 1821, but he found that royalists held the entire country except for Veracruz, Mexico City and [[Acapulco]]. Since at the time that O'Donojú had left Spain, the Cortes was considering greatly expanding the autonomy of the overseas Spanish possessions, O'Donojú proposed to negotiate a treaty with Iturbide on the terms of the Plan of Iguala. The resulting [[Treaty of Córdoba]], which was signed on August 24, kept all existing laws, including the 1812 Constitution, in force until a new constitution for Mexico could be written. O'Donojú became part of the provisional governing junta until his death on October 8. Both the Spanish Cortes and Ferdinand VII rejected the Treaty of Córdoba, and the final break with the mother country came on May 19, 1822, when the Mexican Congress conferred the throne on Iturbide.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 320–323. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 206–210. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 98–99. Guardino, "The War of Independence in Guerrero," 121, 124–125.&lt;/ref&gt;

Central America gained its independence along with New Spain. On September 15, 1821, an [[Act of Independence of Central America|Act of Independence]] was signed in Guatemala City which declared Central America (Guatemala, Honduras, El Salvador, Nicaragua, and Costa Rica) independent from Spain. The regional elites supported the terms of the Plan of Iguala and orchestrated the union of Central America with the Mexican Empire in 1821. Two years later, following Iturbide's downfall, the region, with the exception of Chiapas, peacefully seceded from Mexico on July 1, 1823, establishing the Federal Republic of Central America. The new state existed for seventeen years, centrifugal forces pulling the individual provinces apart by 1840.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 333–340. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 210–213. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 100, 146–149.&lt;/ref&gt;

===South America===
{{Main article|Libertadores|Military career of Simón Bolívar|José de San Martín|Antonio José de Sucre}}
[[File:Zarpe de la Primera Escuadra Nacional.jpg|thumb|250px|The First Chilean Navy Squadron [[Freedom Expedition of Perú|engaged in the liberation of Peru]] and sailed as far as to [[Baja California]] raiding Spanish ships.]]

Unlike in New Spain and Central America, in South America independence was spurred by the pro-independence fighters who had held out for the past half decade. [[José de San Martín]] and [[Simón Bolívar]] inadvertently led a continent-wide [[pincer movement]] from southern and northern South America that liberated most of the [[Hispanic America|Spanish American nations]] on that continent. After securing the [[Chilean War of Independence|independence of Chile]] in 1818, San Martín concentrated on building a naval fleet in the Pacific to counter [[Spanish Empire|Spanish]] control of those waters and reach the [[Royalist (Spanish American Revolution)|royalist stronghold]] of [[Lima]]. By mid-1820 San Martín had assembled a fleet of eight warships and sixteen transport ships under the command of Admiral Cochrane. The fleet set sail from [[Valparaíso]] to [[Paracas Bay|Paracas]] in southern [[Peru]]. On September 7, the army landed at Paracas and successfully took [[Pisco,_Peru|Pisco]]. After this, San Martín, waiting for a generalized Peruvian revolt, chose to avoid direct military confrontation. San Martín hoped that his presence would initiate an authentic [[Peruvian War of Independence|Peruvian revolt]] against Spanish rule, believing that otherwise any liberation would be ephemeral. In the meantime, San Martín engaged in diplomacy with Viceroy [[Joaquín de la Pezuela]], who was under orders from the constitutional government to negotiate on the basis of the [[Spanish Constitution of 1812|1812 Constitution]] and to maintain the unity of the [[Spanish Crown|Spanish Monarchy]]. However, these efforts proved fruitless, since independence and unity of the monarchy could not be reconciled, so the army sailed in late October to a better strategic position in [[Huacho]], in northern Peru. During the next few months, successful land and naval campaigns against the royalists secured the new foothold, and it was at Huacho that San Martín learned that [[Guayaquil]] (in [[Ecuador]]) had declared independence on October 9.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 172–178. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 213–214. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 76.&lt;/ref&gt;

Bolívar, learning about the [[Rafael del Riego#The 1820 revolt and the restoration of the Constitution|collapse of the Cádiz expedition]], spent the year 1820 preparing a liberating campaign in [[Venezuela]]. Bolívar was aided by Spain's new policy of seeking engagement with the insurgents, which Morillo implemented, renouncing to the command in chief, and returning to Spain. Although Bolívar rejected the Spanish proposal that the patriots rejoin Spain under the Spanish Constitution, the two sides established a six-month [[Ceasefire|truce]] and the regularization of the [[rules of engagement]] under the [[Jus gentium|law of nations]] on November 25 and 26. The truce did not last six months. It was apparent to all that the royalist cause had been greatly weakened by the lack of reinforcements. Royalist soldiers and whole units began to desert or defect to the patriots in large numbers. On January 28, 1821, the ''[[cabildo (council)|ayuntamiento]]'' of [[Maracaibo]] declared the province an independent republic that chose to join the new [[nation-state]] of [[Gran Colombia]]. [[Miguel de la Torre]], who had replaced Morillo as head of the army, took this to be a violation of the truce, and although the republicans argued that Maracaibo had switched sides of its own volition, both sides began to prepare for renewed war. The fate of Venezuela was sealed when Bolívar returned there in April leading an army of 7,000 from New Granada. At the [[Battle of Carabobo]] on June 24, the Gran Colombian forces decisively defeated the royalist forces, assuring control of Venezuela save for [[Puerto Cabello]] and guaranteeing Venezuelan independence. Bolívar could now concentrate on Gran Colombia's claims to southern New Granada and Quito.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 218–219. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 219. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 88–90.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Batalla de Carabobo.JPG|thumb|left|Battle of Carabobo, painting by [[Martín Tovar y Tovar]]]]

In Peru, on January 29, 1821, Viceroy Pezuela was deposed in a coup d'état by [[José de la Serna]], but it would be two months before San Martín moved his army closer to Lima by sailing it to [[Ancón District|Ancón]]. During the next few months San Martín once again engaged in negotiations, offering the creation of an independent monarchy; but La Serna insisted on the unity of the Spanish monarchy, so the negotiations came to nothing. By July La Serna judged his hold on Lima to be weak, and on July 8 the royal army abandoned the coastal city in order to reinforce positions in the highlands, with [[Cusco|Cuzco]] as new capital of the viceroyalty. On the 12th San Martín entered Lima, where he was declared "Protector of the Country" on July 28, an office which allowed him to rule the newly independent state.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 178–179. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 214–219. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 76–77.&lt;/ref&gt;

To ensure that the Presidency of Quito became a part of Gran Colombia and did not remain a collection of small, divided republics, Bolívar sent aid in the form of supplies and an army under [[Antonio José de Sucre]] to Guayaquil in February 1821. For a year Sucre was unable to take Quito, and by November both sides, exhausted, signed a ninety-day armistice. The following year, at the [[Battle of Pichincha]] on May 24, 1822, Sucre's Venezuelan forces finally conquered Quito; Gran Colombia's hold on the territory was secure. The following year, after a Peruvian patriot army was destroyed in the [[Battle of Ica]], San Martín met with Simón Bolívar in [[Guayaquil]] on July 26 and 27. Thereafter San Martín decided to retire from the scene. For the next two years, two armies of ''Rioplatense'' (Argentinian), Chilean, Colombian and Peruvian patriots were destroyed trying to penetrate the royalist bastion in the [[Andean]] regions of Peru and [[Upper Peru]]. A year later a Peruvian congress resolved to make Bolívar head of the patriot forces in the country. An internecine conflict between La Serna and General Pedro Antonio Olañeta, which was an extension of the [[Trienio Liberal|Liberal Triennium]], proved to be the royalists' undoing. La Serna lost control of half of his best army by the beginning of 1824, giving the patriots an opportunity.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 185–189, 247–249, 267–272. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 219–220, 222–231. Timothy E. Anna, "[https://books.google.com/books?id=SsmmXmpiOtgC Chaos and the Military Solution: The Fall of Royalist Government in Peru]" in Archer, ''The Wars of Independence in Spanish America'', 272–273. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 77–78, 90–95.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Martin Tovar y Tovar 01.JPG|thumb|300px|The [[Battle of Ayacucho]], in Peru, ensured the independence of South America in 1824]]

Under the command of Bolívar and Sucre, the experienced veterans of the combined army, mainly Colombians, destroyed a royalist army under La Serna's command in the [[Battle of Ayacucho]] on December 9, 1824.  La Serna's army was numerically superior but consisted of mostly new recruits. The only significant royalist area remaining on the continent was the highland country of [[Upper Peru]]. Following the Battle of Ayacucho, the royalist troops of Upper Peru under the command of Olañeta surrendered after he died in [[Nor Chichas Province|Tumusla]] on April 2, 1825. Bolívar tended to favor maintaining the unity of Upper Peru with Peru, but the Upper Peruvian leaders—many former royalists, like Casimiro Olañeta, nephew of General Olañeta—gathered in a congress under Sucre's auspices supported the country's independence. Bolívar left the decision to Sucre, who went along with the congress. Sucre proclaimed Upper Peru's independence in the [[Sucre|city]] which now bears his name on August 6, bringing the main wars of independence to an end.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Bushnell | first = David | title = The Santander Regime in Gran Colombia| publisher = Greenwood Press| year = 1970| location = Westport | pages = 325–335| isbn = 0-8371-2981-8}} Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 272–273, 279–284.

As it became clear that there was to be no reversal of Spanish American independence, several of the new states began to receive international recognition. Early, in 1822, the United States recognized [[Chile]], the [[United Provinces of South America|United Provinces of the Río de la Plata]], Peru, [[Gran Colombia]], and Mexico. Britain waited until 1825, after the Battle of Ayacucho, to recognize Mexico, Gran Colombia, and Río de la Plata. Both nations recognized more Spanish American states in the next few years.&lt;ref&gt;Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 105–106.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Last royalist bastions===
[[File:Batalla de Pueblo Viejo.jpg|thumb|300px|Spain fails to reconquer Mexico at the [[Isidro Barradas|Battle of Tampico]] in 1829]]

The Spanish coastal fortifications in [[Veracruz]], [[Callao]] and [[Chiloé]] were the footholds that resisted until 1825 and 1826 respectively. In the following decade, royalist guerrillas continued to operate in several countries and Spain launched a few attempts to retake parts of the Spanish American mainland. In 1827 Colonel [[José Arizabalo]] started an irregular war with Venezuelan guerrillas, and Brigadier [[Isidro Barradas]] led the last attempt with regular troops to reconquer Mexico in 1829. The [[Pincheira brothers]] moved to Patagonia and remained there as royalist outlaws until defeated in 1832. But efforts like these did not reverse the new political situation.

The increasing irrelevance of the [[Holy Alliance]] after 1825 and the fall of the Bourbon dynasty in France in 1830 during the [[July Revolution]] eliminated the principal support of Ferdinand VII in Europe, but it was not until the king's death in 1833 that Spain finally abandoned all plans of military reconquest, and in 1836 its government went so far as to renounce sovereignty over all of continental America. During the course of the 19th century, Spain would recognize each of the new states.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=OxcpEbVzMpQC Costeloe, Michael P. ''Response to Revolution'', 100]&lt;/ref&gt; Only Cuba and Puerto Rico remained under Spanish rule, until the [[Spanish–American War]] in 1898.

==Effects of independence==

===Economics===
The nearly decade and a half of wars greatly weakened the Spanish American economies and political institutions, which hindered the region's potential [[economic development]] for most of the nineteenth century and resulted in the enduring instability the region experienced. Independence destroyed the de facto [[trade bloc]] that was the Spanish Empire - [[Manila galleon]]s and [[Spanish treasure fleet]]s in particular. After independence, trade ''among'' the new Spanish American nations was less than it had been in the colonial period. Once the ties were broken, the small populations of most of the new nations provided little incentive to entice Spanish American producers to recreate the old trade patterns. In addition, the protection against European competition, which the Spanish monopoly had provided to the manufacturing sectors of the economy, ended. Due to expediency, protective tariffs for these sectors, in particular textile production, were permanently dropped and foreign imports beat out local production. This greatly affected Native communities, which in many parts of Spanish America, specialized in supplying finished products to the urban markets, albeit using pre-[[Industrial Revolution|industrial]] techniques. The wars also greatly affected the principal economic sector of the region, mining. Silver production in Bolivia halved after independence and it dropped by three quarters in Mexico.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 344–347. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 245. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 131–136.&lt;/ref&gt; Cities dependent on seaborne trade like [[Valdivia]] plunged into depression as the intracolonial trade system collapsed.&lt;ref name=Bernedo&gt;{{Citation

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Foreign trade policies varied among the new countries, some like the [[United Provinces of Río de la Plata]] and [[Peru]] applied initially [[protectionism|protectionist]] policies while Chile was more open to foreign trade while still applying a kind of [[neomercantilism]].&lt;ref name=salazarpinto19-21&gt;[[Gabriel Salazar|Salazar, Gabriel]]; Pinto, Julio (2002). ''Historia contemporánea de Chile III. La economía: mercados empresarios y trabajadores.'' [[LOM Ediciones]]. {{ISBN|956-282-172-2}} pp. 19–21.&lt;/ref&gt;

To compensate for the lack of capital, foreign investment—in particular from Great Britain—was courted, but it was not sizable enough to initiate an economic recovery. Finally the new nations entered the world economy after the end of the [[French Revolutionary Wars|French Revolutionary]] and [[Napoleonic Wars]], when the economies of Europe and the United States were recovering and aggressively seeking new markets to sell their products after more than two decades of disruption. Ultimately Spanish America could only connect to the world markets as an exporter of raw materials and a consumer of finished products.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 343–344. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 244–245. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 133–136.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Society===
{{see also|Liberalism and conservatism in Latin America}}
In addition to improving the economy, the lower social classes also had to be integrated into the new [[body politic]], although they often got few rewards from independence. The political debate seeking answers to these questions was marked by a clash—at times on the battlefield—between liberalism and conservatism. Conservatives sought to maintain the traditional social structures in order to ensure stability; liberals sought to create a more dynamic society and economy by ending ethnically-based social distinctions and freeing property from economic restrictions. In its quest to transform society, liberals often adopted policies that were not welcome by Native communities, who had benefited from unique protections afforded to them by traditional Spanish law.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 347–351. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 245. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 142–143.&lt;/ref&gt;

Independence, however, did initiate the [[Abolitionism|abolition of slavery]] in Spanish America, as it was seen as part of the independence struggle, since many slaves had gained their manumission by joining the patriot armies. In areas where slavery was not a major source of labor (Mexico, Central America, Chile), emancipation occurred almost immediately after independence was achieved. In areas where slavery was a main labor source (Colombia, Venezuela, Peru, Argentina), emancipation was carried out in steps over the next three decades, usually first with the creation of free-womb laws and programs for [[compensated emancipation]]. By the early 1850s, slavery had been abolished in the independent nations of Spanish America.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 347–349.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Role of women===
[[File:Juana Azurduy.jpg|thumb|[[Juana Azurduy de Padilla]]]]

Women were not simply spectators throughout the Independence Wars of Latin America. Many women took sides on political issues and joined independence movements in order to participate on many different levels. Women could not help but act as caring relatives either as mother, sister, wives or daughters of the men who were fighting. Women created political organizations and organized meetings and groups to donate food and supplies to the soldiers.
 
Some women supported the wars as spies, informants and combatants. [[Manuela Sáenz]] was a long term lover of [[Simón Bolívar]] and acted as his spy and confidante and was secretary of his archive. She saved his life on two occasions, nursed wounded soldiers and has even been believed some historians to have fought in a few battles. Sáenz followed Bolívar and his army through the independence wars and became to be known in Latin America as the “mother of feminism and women’s emancipation and equal rights.” 
Bolívar himself was a supporter of women’s rights and suffrage in Latin America. It was Bolívar who allowed for Sáenz to become the great pioneer of women’s freedom. He wanted to set the women of Latin America free from the oppression and inferiority of what the Spanish regime had established.  Bolívar even made Sáenz a Colonel of the Colombian Army due to her heroics which caused controversy because there were no women in the army at the time. Another woman who gained prominence in the fight for independence was [[Juana Azurduy de Padilla]], a mixed-race woman who fought for independence in the Río de la Plata region. Argentine President [[Cristina Fernández de Kirchner]] posthumously promoted her to the rank of general.&lt;ref&gt;The Argentine President promotes Juana Azurduy to General in the Argentine Army.www.szmm.gov.hu/download.php?ctag=download&amp;docID=14380&lt;/ref&gt;

According to gender stereotypes, women were not meant to be soldiers; only men were supposed to engage in fighting and conflict. There were still plenty of women present on the battlefields to help rescue and nurse soldiers. Some women fought alongside their husbands and sons on the battlefield. The majority of women assumed supportive and non-competitive roles such as fundraising and caring for the sick. Revolution for women meant something different than for men. Women saw revolution as a way to earn equal rights, such as voting, and to overcome the suppression of subordination of women to men. 
Women were usually identified as victims during the independence wars since the women of Latin America were forced to sacrifice for the cause. The ideals of womanhood meant that women must sacrifice what the situation required such as a mother sacrificing her son or a virgin knowing she might be sacrificing motherhood or marriage due to the loss of many young men. This view meant that women were meant to contribute to independence in a supportive role while leaving the combat and politics in the hands of the men.&lt;ref&gt;” O’Connor, Mothers Making Latin America”, 26-27.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Government and politics===
{{see also|Treaties to recognise the Spanish American independence}}
[[File:Spanish Empire - 1824.jpg|Right|thumb|350px|Map of territories that became independent during those wars (blue)]]
Independence also did not result in stable political regimes, save in a few countries. First, the new nations did not have well-defined identities, but rather the process of creating identities was only beginning. This would be carried out through newspapers and the creation of national symbols, including new names for the countries ("Mexico", "Colombia", "Ecuador", "Bolivia", "Argentina"), that broke with the past. In addition, the borders were not firmly established, and the struggle between [[federalism]] and [[Centralized government|centralism]], which began in independence, continued throughout the rest of the century. Two large states that emerged from the wars—[[Gran Colombia]] and the [[Federal Republic of Central America]]—collapsed after a decade or two, and Argentina would not [[Constitution of Argentina|consolidate politically]] until the 1860s.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 342–343. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 146–152.&lt;/ref&gt;

The wars destroyed  the old civilian bureaucracy that had governed the region for centuries, as institutions such as the [[Audiencia Real|audiencia]]s were eliminated and many ''Peninsular'' officials fled to Spain. The Catholic Church, which had been an important social and political institution during the colonial period, initially came out weakened by the end of the conflicts. As with government officials, many ''Peninsular'' bishops abandoned their dioceses and their posts were not filled for decades until new prelates could be created and relations between the new nations and the [[Pope|Vatican]] were regularized. Then as the Church recovered, its economic and political power was attacked by liberals.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 351–352. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 145–146, 152–153.&lt;/ref&gt;

Despite the fact that the period of the wars of independence itself was marked by a rapid expansion of [[Representative democracy|representative government]],&lt;ref&gt;Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 3–5, 213, 239. Kinsbruner states, "[I]n Mexico between 1820 and 1835 a larger percentage of adult males were permitted to vote than was the case in the United States, Great Britain, or France." ''Independence in Spanish America'', 90.&lt;/ref&gt; for several of the new nations the nineteenth century was marked by militarism because of the lack of well-defined political and national institutions. The armies and officers that came into existence during the process of independence wanted to ensure that they got their rewards once the struggle was over. Many of these armies did not fully disband once the wars were over and they proved to be one of the stabler institutions in the first decades of national existence. These armies and their leaders effectively influenced the course of political development. Out of this new tradition came the [[caudillo]]s, strongmen who amassed formal and informal economic, military and political power in themselves.&lt;ref&gt;Lynch, ''Spanish American Revolutions'', 341–342, 352–355. Rodríguez, ''Independence of Spanish America'', 219–222, 240–244. Kinsbruner, ''Independence in Spanish America'', 143–144.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Cnote2 Begin|liststyle=upper-alpha}}
{{Cnote2|Note A|[[Portuguese invasion of the Banda Oriental (1811–12)|First invasion]] of the [[Banda Oriental]] by the Portuguese army led by Diogo de Sousa in 1811 to annex the territory, which during the colonial period was disputed between Spain and Portugal. Not for destroy the independent government of Buenos Aires. In 1816 he invaded the Banda Oriental again and [[Portuguese conquest of the Banda Oriental|conquered]] it after a military campaign that lasted until 1820.}}
{{Cnote2|Note B|During the course of the war, the various independent states that were formed at the beginning of the war went through different processes that changed them politically. This was due to reasons such as the overthrow of the government by the royalists and their subsequent restoration (for example, Chile and Venezuela), and also by the union of independent states that came to form a new political entity (Gran Colombia and the Mexican Empire).}}
{{Cnote2|Note C|Due to the difficulty of representing in the infobox all the political stages of the independent states that suffered interruption in their process of separation from the Spanish Monarchy or that merged with other States to create a new political entity, or both, they will only appear in their final stage with which they managed to consolidate. Chile (1817–1826), Gran Colombia (1819–1824), México (1821–1829), Peru (1821–1826), Bolivia (1825).}}
{{Cnote2|Note D|Mexico in its consolidation stage was organized as an [[First Mexican Empire|empire]] from 1821 to 1823. When the empire was dissolved, Mexico was reorganized as a [[First Mexican Republic|republic]] and the Central American territories that were part of the empire were reorganized into a new political entity called the United Provinces of Central America.}}
{{Cnote2|Note E|During the course of the war, the United Provinces organized three land forces that fought on different fronts and periods: the army that confronted the realists of Montevideo, the [[Army of the North]] and the [[Army of the Andes]]. In the maritime area, the government organized a naval force in 1811, which was [[Battle of San Nicolás|destroyed in battle]] in that same year, so in 1813 he organized a second naval force that was operative until the [[Battle of Buceo|decisive victory]] obtained in 1814. He then used corsairs in the sea until the end of the war.}}
{{Cnote2|Note F|In 1817, after the [[Battle of Chacabuco|triumph of the independents in Chacabuco]] and the subsequent restoration of the Chilean government, the [[Chilean Army]] was again organized, which fought along with the Army of the Andes in the center-south zone of Chile. Later, both armies would form the [[Liberating Expedition of Peru]], although a part of the Chilean force remained fighting in the country until its territorial consolidation. As for the maritime area, between 1817 and 1818 the [[Chilean Navy]] ([[First Chilean Navy Squadron]]) was founded and would operate until the end of the war. Between 1817 and 1820, Chile also used corsairs in the sea.}}
{{Cnote2|Note G|In its consolidation phase, the Mexican government had as a land force the so-called [[Army of the Three Guarantees]], while to fight in the sea it founded the [[Mexican Navy]].}}

A Strawberry festival is an event and [[Festival|celebration]] in many [[town]]s in [[North America]].  In most instances, areas around these towns are, or have been, deeply involved in the production and marketing of [[Garden Strawberry|strawberries]], and the festivals are usually held in late [[Spring (season)|spring]] around the time of the strawberry harvest.  Such festivals generally involve a parade and other community events. People come from all different places yearly. They get to enjoy the environment and consume strawberries in a variety of ways.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://castrawberryfestival.org/events-attractions/strawberry-treats/|title=Eats &amp; Treats {{!}} California Strawberry Festival|website=castrawberryfestival.org|language=en-US|access-date=2017-06-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Strawberry Festival has also been around for many years, and as of today they continue to celebrate it in many towns in North America. Each town is unique with their strawberry festival celebration.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5543">'''The Active Eye''' was a 1975 exhibition of work by contemporary [[New Zealand]] photographers, originated by the Manawatu Art Gallery in Palmerston North and touring to other galleries around New Zealand.&lt;ref name='Ireland'&gt;{{cite web|last1=Ireland|first1=Peter|title=Photography - New directions, 1970s to 2000s|url=http://www.teara.govt.nz/en/ephemera/43223/the-active-eye-exhibition-manawatu-art-gallery-1975|website=Te Ara|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition was one of the first to focus on contemporary photography in New Zealand, and attracted considerable controversy around the works included by artist Fiona Clark.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wells|first1=Peter|title=Incandescent Moment: Fiona Clark's Go Girl|journal=Art New Zealand|date=Autumn 2003|issue=106|url=http://www.art-newzealand.com/Issue106/Clark.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==The exhibition==

The exhibition was a collaboration between photography organisation PhotoForum and the Manawatu Art Gallery under the director at the time, [[Luit Bieringa]], and based on photos selected by Tom Hutchins, John B. Turner and Gordon H. Brown.&lt;ref name='Ireland'/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Blackman|first1=Gary|title=Looking Directly at the Camera|url=http://www.landfallreview.com/looking-directly-at-the-camera/|website=Landfall Review Online}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was sponsored by the [[Creative New Zealand | Queens Elizabeth II Arts Council]] and Kodak New Zealand.&lt;ref name ='CAG'&gt;{{cite web|title=The Active Eye|url=http://christchurchartgallery.org.nz/exhibitions/contemporary-new-zealand-photography|website=Christchurch Art Gallery|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

The exhibition consisted of 104 works: among the many photographers represented in the exhibition were [[Ans Westra]], [[Peter Peryer]], Murray Hedwig, Glenn Busch and [[Fiona Clark (photographer)|Fiona Clark]].&lt;ref name ='CAG'/&gt;&lt;ref name ='OTN'&gt;{{cite web|title=Rinse and Repeat|url=http://overthenet.blogspot.co.nz/2014/08/rinse-and-repeat.html|website=Over the net|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; David Fowler. The exhibition was scheduled to show in 12 New Zealand art galleries.&lt;ref name ='OTN'/&gt;

==Censorship controversy==

Two works by photographer Fiona Clark included in the exhibition raised objections from members of the public and were later removed from the exhibition.&lt;ref name ='Wells'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Wells|first1=Peter|title=Incandescent Moment Fiona Clark's Go Girl|journal=Art New Zealand|date=Autumn 2003|volume=106|url=http://www.art-newzealand.com/Issue106/Clark.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; The two black and white images were from a series of ten images, taken by Clark at a dance party at the [[University of Auckland]] café for Pride Week in 1974.&lt;ref name="Clark"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Active Eye|url=http://www.fionaclark.com/gallery/the-active-eye.html|website=Fiona Clark|accessdate=27 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The photographs depict transgender women, and the white paper around the images were inscribed with short texts by a friend of Clark's, including phrases such as 'Aren’t you furious you hung up closet queens' and 'How many of you boys would like to suck these tits?'.&lt;ref name="Hurrell"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hurrell|first1=John|title=Fiona Clark at Artspace|url=http://eyecontactsite.com/2016/03/fiona-clark-at-artspace|website=EyeContact|accessdate=27 April 2016|date=7 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following complaints, the works were reviewed by police and not deemed indecent; however, a number of galleries including the [[Sarjeant Gallery]], the [[Christchurch Art Gallery|Robert McDougall Art Annex]], and the [[Govett-Brewster Art Gallery]] bowed to pressure from the public and local councillors and withdrew the works from display (in some cases, the works could be viewed in staff offices).&lt;ref name ='Hurrell'/&gt; The  [[Auckland Art Gallery]] cancelled the exhibition as a result of the controversy.&lt;ref name ='Hurrell'/&gt;

==Impact and legacy==

''The Active Eye'' marked an important point in photography's acceptance as a contemporary art form in New Zealand.&lt;ref name='Ireland'/&gt; In the mid 1970s few New Zealand public art galleries collected or showed contemporary photography.&lt;ref name = 'Hewson'&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hewson|first1=Paul|title=Snaps Gallery and the exhibiting of photographs|journal=Art New Zealand|date=Winter 1979|issue=12|url=http://www.art-newzealand.com/Issues11to20/snaps.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Active Eye'', as the first national survey of contemporary photography, is viewed as a turning point in the art form's position in New Zealand art history and art discourse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Hutchins|first1=Tom|title=Three New Zealand Photographers: Fiona Clark, Laurence Aberhart, Peter Peryer|journal=Art New Zealand|date=Winter 1979|volume=14|url=http://www.art-newzealand.com/Issues11to20/exhibitions14akth.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The works shown in ''The Active Eye'' were acquired by the Manawatu Art Gallery (now [[Te Manawa]]) as the basis of their contemporary photography collection.&lt;ref name = 'Hewson'/&gt; A selection were displayed in 2012 in the exhibition ''Now and Then''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lacy|first1=Judith|title=Images show artist behind camera|url=http://www.stuff.co.nz/manawatu-standard/your-manawatu/tribune/6844847/Images-show-artist-behind-camera|website=Manawatu Standard|accessdate=27 April 2016|date=2 May 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Chimes: A Goblin Story of Some Bells that Rang an Old Year Out and a New Year In''''', a short novel by [[Charles Dickens]], was written and published in 1844, one year after ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'' and one year before ''[[The Cricket on the Hearth]]''. It is the second in his series of "Christmas books": five short books with strong social and moral messages that he published during the 1840s. In addition to ''A Christmas Carol'' and ''The Cricket on the Hearth'', the Christmas books include ''[[The Battle of Life]]'' (1846) and ''[[The Haunted Man and the Ghost's Bargain]]'' (1848).

==Development history==
The book was written in late 1844, during Dickens' year-long visit to Italy.&lt;ref name="House"&gt;{{cite book|last=House|first=Madeline|author2=Tillotston, Kathleen |author3=Storey, Graham |title=The Letters of Charles Dickens|publisher=Oxford University Press|year=2002|chapter=Preface, p.x|isbn=9780198124757|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=8Xxn8x-JYLMC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;lpg=PR11&amp;vq=Chimes&amp;dq=The+Chimes+Dickens&amp;ie=ISO-8859-1&amp;output=html}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[John Forster (biographer)|John Forster]], his first biographer, records that Dickens, hunting for a title and structure for his next contracted Christmas story, was struck one day by the clamour of the Genoese bells audible from the villa where they were staying.

{{quote|All Genoa lay beneath him, and up from it, with some sudden set of the wind, came in one fell sound the clang and clash of all its steeples, pouring into his ears, again and again, in a tuneless, grating, discordant, jerking, hideous vibration that made his ideas "spin round and round till they lost themselves in a whirl of vexation and giddiness, and dropped down dead."&lt;ref name="Forster"&gt;{{cite book|last=Forster|first=John|title=The Life of Charles Dickens|volume=vol 4|chapter=Chapter V|url=http://www.lang.nagoya-u.ac.jp/~matsuoka/CD-Forster-4.html#IV}}&lt;/ref&gt;
}}
Two days later Forster received a [[Letters of Charles Dickens|letter from Dickens]] which read simply: ""We have heard THE CHIMES at midnight, Master Shallow!",&lt;ref name="Forster" /&gt; and the writing of the book began.  Forster describes Dickens' intentions in writing ''The Chimes'' as striking "a blow for the poor".   {{quote|They had always been his clients, they had never been forgotten in any of his books, but here nothing else was to be remembered ... he had come to have as little faith for the putting down of any serious evil, as in a then notorious city alderman's gabble for the putting down of suicide. The latter had stirred his indignation to its depths just before he came to Italy, and his increased opportunities of solitary reflection since had strengthened and extended it. When he came therefore to think of his new story for Christmas time, he resolved to make it a plea for the poor ... He was to try and convert Society, as he had converted [[Ebenezer Scrooge|Scrooge]], by showing that its happiness rested on the same foundations as those of the individual, which are mercy and charity not less than justice.&lt;ref name="Forster" /&gt;}}

Dickens returned to London for a week in December 1844 and gave readings of the finished book to friends prior to publication, to judge its impact. The artist [[Daniel Maclise]], who had contributed two illustrations to ''The Chimes'' and attended two of these events, portrayed the reading of 3 December 1844 in a well-known sketch.&lt;ref name="Cohen"&gt;{{cite book|last=Cohen|first=Jane A|title=Charles Dickens and his Original Illustrators|publisher=Ohio State University Press|year=1980|pages=168|chapter=10|url=http://www.ohiostatepress.org/books/Complete%20PDFs/Cohen%20Charles/13.pdf|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727143112/http://www.ohiostatepress.org/books/Complete%20PDFs/Cohen%20Charles/13.pdf|archivedate=27 July 2011|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Explanation of the novel's title==
The chimes are old bells in the church on whose steps Trotty Veck plies his trade. The book is divided into four parts named "quarters", after the quarter chimes of a [[striking clock]]. (This parallels Dickens naming the parts of ''A Christmas Carol'' "staves" – that is "stanzas" – and dividing ''The Cricket on the Hearth'' into "chirps".)

==Plot summary==
On New Year's Eve, Trotty, a poor elderly "ticket-porter" or casual messenger, is filled with gloom at the reports of crime and immorality in the newspapers, and wonders whether the working classes are simply wicked by nature. His daughter Meg and her long-time fiancé Richard arrive and announce their decision to marry next day. Trotty hides his misgivings, but their happiness is dispelled by an encounter with the pompous [[Alderman]] Cute, plus a [[Political economy|political economist]] and a young gentleman with a nostalgia, all of whom make Trotty, Meg and Richard feel they hardly have a right to exist, let alone marry.

Trotty carries a note for Cute to Sir Joseph Bowley [[Member of Parliament|MP]], who dispenses charity to the poor in the manner of a paternal dictator. Bowley is ostentatiously settling his debts to ensure a clean start to the new year, and berates Trotty because he owes a few [[shilling]]s to his local shop which he cannot pay off. Returning home, convinced that he and his fellow poor are naturally ungrateful and have no place in society, Trotty encounters Will Fern, a poor countryman, and his orphaned niece, Lilian. Fern has been accused of [[vagrancy (people)|vagrancy]] and wants to visit Cute to set matters straight, but from a conversation overheard at Bowley's house, Trotty is able to warn him that Cute plans to have him arrested and imprisoned. He takes the pair home with him and he and Meg share their meagre food and poor lodging with the visitors. Meg tries to hide her distress, but it seems she has been dissuaded from marrying Richard by her encounter with Cute and the others.

In the night, the bells seem to call Trotty. Going to the church, he finds the tower door unlocked and climbs to the bellchamber, where he discovers the spirits of the bells and their [[goblin]] attendants who reprimand him for losing [[faith]] in man's destiny to improve. He is told that he fell from the tower during his climb and is now dead, and Meg's subsequent life must now be an object lesson for him. There follows a series of visions which he is forced to watch, helpless to interfere with the troubled lives of Meg, Richard, Will and Lilian over the subsequent years. Richard descends into alcoholism; Meg eventually marries him in an effort to save him, but he dies ruined, leaving her with a baby. Will is driven in and out of prison by petty laws and restrictions; Lilian turns to prostitution. In the end, destitute, Meg is driven to contemplate drowning herself and her child, thus committing the [[mortal sin]]s of murder and suicide. The chimes' intention is to teach Trotty that, far from being naturally wicked, mankind is formed to strive for nobler things, and will fall only when crushed and repressed beyond bearing. Trotty breaks down when he sees Meg poised to jump into the river, cries that he has learned his lesson and begs the Chimes to save her, whereupon he finds himself able to touch her and prevent her from jumping.

At the end of the book, Trotty finds himself awakening at home as if from a dream as the bells ring in the New Year of the day Trotty originally climbed the tower. Meg and Richard have chosen to wed, and all of her friends have spontaneously chosen to provide a wedding feast and celebration. The author explicitly invites the reader to decide if this "awakening" is a dream-within-a-dream. The reader must choose between the harsh consequences of the behavior of the upper classes in Trotty's vision, or the happiness of the wedding.

==Main characters==
*
* Toby "Trotty" Veck, the protagonist, a poor elderly messenger or "ticket-porter."
* Margaret "Meg" Veck, Toby's 21-year-old daughter
* Mrs. Anne Chickenstalker, the local shopkeeper
* Alderman Cute, a Justice of the Peace
* Mr. Filer, a political economist in the [[Utilitarian]] mould
* Sir Joseph Bowley, a rich paternalist MP
* Will Fern, a countryman
* Lilian Fern, Will's orphaned niece

==Major themes==
This is a campaigning story like its predecessor ''[[A Christmas Carol]]'', written with the intention of swaying readers towards Dickens' moral message. The chimes represent time, and the main themes of the story are summarised in the three wrongs they accuse Trotty of committing:

• Harking back to a golden age that never was, instead of striving to improve conditions here and now.

• Believing that individual human joys and sorrows do not matter to a higher power.

• Condemning those who are fallen and unfortunate, and offering them neither help nor pity.

&lt;blockquote&gt;'Who turns his back upon the fallen and disfigured of his kind; abandons them as vile; and does not trace and track with pitying eyes the unfenced precipice by which they fell from good—grasping in their fall some tufts and shreds of that lost soil, and clinging to them still when bruised and dying in the gulf below; does wrong to Heaven and man, to time and to eternity. And you have done that wrong!'&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Literary significance and reception==
''A Christmas Carol'' had been extremely well received the previous year, and ''The Chimes'' aroused public interest and anticipation. Five different stage productions of the book were running within weeks of publication and nearly 20,000 copies were sold in the first three months. It had a high media profile, and was widely reviewed and discussed. Critical opinion was divided; those sympathetic to its social and political message liked the book, but others thought it dangerously radical. The ''[[Northern Star (chartist newspaper)|Northern Star]]'' reviewer called Dickens "the champion of the poor"; ''[[John Bull]]'' rejected his unflattering caricatures of philanthropy.&lt;ref name=slater&gt;{{cite book | last=Slater | first=Michael | authorlink=Michael Slater | title= Introduction to The Chimes in Charles Dickens: The Christmas Books, Volume 1. | location=London | publisher=Penguin Classics | year=1985 | pages=139–140}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was certainly a financial success for Dickens, and remained popular for many years, although in the long term its fame was eclipsed by that of ''A Christmas Carol''.

==Allusions and references==

===Allusions to other works===
Asking the upper classes to stop interfering with his life and leave him to die, Will Fern makes a bitter reference to the biblical [[Book of Ruth]], deliberately misquoting [[Ruth (biblical figure)|Ruth]]'s "Whither thou goest, I will go" speech.

===Allusions to actual history, geography and current science===
The novel's setting is contemporary and the 1840s (the "[[Hungry Forties]]") were a time of social and political unrest.

Trotty's conviction that poor people are naturally wicked is influenced by an article in his newspaper about a young woman who has tried to drown herself and her child, and this motif returns at the climax of the book, when Meg is driven to contemplate the same course of action. This is a reference to Mary Furley, a destitute young woman sentenced to death in 1844 for [[infanticide]] after her desperation not to return to the [[workhouse]] led to a [[suicide attempt]] in which her child drowned.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/books/suicide/03.html|title=Gates, Barbara T. ''Mad Crimes and Sad Histories'' Chapter 3 at VictorianWeb|accessdate=13 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; This case caused great public debate in the late spring of 1844. Dickens took part in the general outcry against the sentence, which was eventually commuted to [[penal transportation|transportation]].&lt;ref&gt;Slater, 264&lt;/ref&gt; Among other works inspired by the Furley case is [[Thomas Hood]]'s poem ''[[The Bridge of Sighs (poem)|The Bridge of Sighs]]''.

Alderman Cute is a parody of [[Peter Laurie|Sir Peter Laurie]], a Middlesex magistrate, alderman and former Lord Mayor of London, known for his determination to "put down" the lower classes and their antisocial behaviour.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gresham.ac.uk/event.asp?PageId=4&amp;EventId=549|title=Dickens' Law Makers and Law Breakers: Barnard's Inn and Beyond|last=Sanders|first=Prof. Andrew|date=7.11.2006|work=Lecture transcript|publisher=Gresham College website|accessdate=6 December 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; His remarks on the 1844 Mary Furley case have been cited as one inspiration to Dickens to write ''The Chimes''.

The unnamed young man who harks back to the "good old times" is a reference to the [[Young England]] movement. Dickens removed many of these references prior to publication.

==Adaptations==
In 1914, the book was made into a silent film, ''[[The Chimes (film)|The Chimes]]'', directed by [[Thomas Bentley]].

A musical adaptation of ''The Chimes'' was created in 1992 by Lisa Kofod and Gay Donat Reed, with music by Paul Johnson. A staged reading of this work was produced at The Workhouse Theatre in New York City.

''The Chimes'' was adapted into a 24-minute [[clay animation|clay-animated]] film in 2000 by [[Xyzoo Animation]]. It won a Cine Special Jury award in 2002.

The Colonial Radio Theatre in Boston produced a full cast radio production of ''The Chimes'' in 2000. This was released on CD by [[Blackstone Audio]] in 2007, and re-released by Brilliance Audio in 2011.

In 2004 a stage adaptation by Les Smith premiered at the [[Southwark Playhouse]].

In 2015, Audible issued ''The Chimes'' as a free audible book with Christmas well wishes from the company to its subscribers.

'''''The Death Ray''''' is a graphic novel by American cartoonist [[Daniel Clowes]] that first appeared in issue {{No.}}23 of Clowes's comic book ''[[Eightball (comics)|Eightball]]'' in 2004, and then as a standalone book in 2011.{{sfn|Leitko|2011}}

==Plot==
The story, which flashes back and forth from the 1970s and present day, revolves around a man Andy who reflects upon his childhood and the events that led to him living a life alone, with no friends or loved ones. Raised by his grandfather after his parents both died (mother from a blood clot in the brain, his father from cancer) when he was young., Andy is bullied by his classmates and dominated by his obnoxious best friend Louie. When he turns seventeen, the Andy (who is weak and skinny) begins smoking and suddenly experiences short bursts of what appear, to him, as being super strength. Shortly afterwords, Andy's grandfather provides him with a box containing belongings of his father that he had kept secret. These include a journal, that explain that as a kid, Andy was exposed to experimental hormones by his father to ensure that his son would not be frail and weak like he was. This causes Louie to believe that smoking causes Andy to become super strong. Louis then convinces him to become an amateur super-hero with him as his sidekick.

Seeking to find out more about his father, Andy requests that his aunt send him anything that she might have that belonged to his father. His aunt sends him a box that contains a "death ray" that disintegrates anyone shot by its ray.

Much of the story deals with Andy's relationship with his grandfather, who is suffering from the onset of dementia and his black nurse/aid Delia, who Andy secretly has a crush on. Louie becomes more and more obsessed with having Andy use the death ray to kill local bullies and troublemakers, such as the abusive father of a girl Louie has a crush on. As Louie and Andy drift apart, Andy befriends Sonny, the ex-boyfriend of Louie's sister who attempts to help Andy cope with his grandfather's mental decline.

Ultimately, Louie attempts to crush Andy's head in with a rock in order to permanently steal the death ray from him. Andy is forced to kill Andy, disintegrating him as a result. Afterwords, Andy's grandfather is placed into a group home, Andy is given custody of Louie's dog by his family (who do not suspect Andy of foul play), and Andy and the dog are forced to leave school in order to move in with his aunt.

The story then skips to the early 2000s; Andy is now in his late 40s and is bitter and cynical about life; twice divorced, he has since adopted Louie's nihilistic view on life and the death ray and repeatedly moves from town to town, to avoid suspicion for the murders he commits with the gun. Having used the death ray to murder the men that both of his wives cheated on him with, and having failed at a relationship with his high school crush Dusty, Andy sold the death ray to a pawn shop and moved on with his life. However, after his neighbor's pit bull murdered Louis's dog and then laughs about it, Andy seeks to retrieve the gun and murder his neighbor. Andy convinces Sonny to help him track down the death ray (which Sonny believes is just a toy gun) and along the way, Sonny visits Dusty for Andy and relays an apology to him for unstated incident that ended their budding relationship.

Andy murders his neighbor with the death ray, off-panel and ultimately moves back to the town where he grew up. Once he arrives back to the town, Andy meets the main bully who terrorized him growing up and who, in their last meeting, told Andy that he hoped his grandfather would die from his dementia. Andy resists the urge to murder the now grown up bully, but comments that the bully's now mature and less jerkish behavior was a lie.

The story ends with a three part epilogue:

*The first part has the ghosts of four of Andy's victims that Andy murdered for selfish reasons and which he regretted: a drug dealer who sold drugs to Delia's daughter, two of the men who slept with his ex-wives, and Louie.
*Sonny, Dusty, Delia, and Andy's grandfather describing Andy: while Delia and Sonny have favorable views of Andy, Dusty refuses to comment while Andy's grandfather is consumed with sorrow over his grandson being a murderer.
*Three endings for the graphic novel, told in one panel with text that describes the endings:
**Ending One has Andy going insane and using the Ray Gun to murder every living soul on Earth until only he exists
**Ending Two has Andy committing suicide and the world going on as normal, with no one ever knowing about Andy's death ray
***Andy dates a divorced woman in his apartment building, murdering her ex-husband with the death ray among other people who annoy him. Andy's relationship with the divorced woman eventually fails and he buries the death ray in the woods to avoid any further temptation to use it, after he realizes that he no longer has the available funds to relocate at the drop of a hat. Andy adopts multiple dogs over the coming decades, and ultimately dies from cancer in his late 70s, alone and childless. 
 
The final set of panels has Andy and his dog watching fireworks in the distance, while repeating a mantra from earlier in the book (during a fantasy sequence where Andy imagines life as a super-hero, with Louie as his sidekick) saying that he will always be available to help a stranger out if they are in trouble.

==Reception==
In 2012, ''The Death Ray'' won a [[Harvey Award]] for Best Graphic Album of Previously Published Work.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.harveyawards.org/2012/09/09/congratulations-to-the-harvey-award-recipients/ "Congratulations to the Harvey Award Recipients"] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150906171830/http://www.harveyawards.org/2012/09/09/congratulations-to-the-harvey-award-recipients/ |date=2015-09-06 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
&lt;!--Wikipedia guidelines encourage a summary between 400 and 700 words. Think carefully before adding material to this section--&gt;
[[Will McKenzie|Will]], [[Neil Sutherland (The Inbetweeners)|Neil]] and [[Jay Cartwright|Jay]]'s girlfriends have all broken up with them since the events of [[The Inbetweeners Movie|the last film]], and [[Simon Cooper (The Inbetweeners)|Simon]] is unhappy with his relationship with Lucy, who has become [[stalking|obsessive]] and [[verbal abuse|abusive]]. Simon and Will are depressed and ostracised at [[Sheffield University]] and [[University of Bristol]] respectively; Neil is working in a bank; and Jay is taking a gap year in [[Australia]]. He emails Neil, claiming that he is now a top DJ at a popular nightclub, lives in a luxury mansion, and has daily sex with multiple partners. This, plus the boys boredom with their current lives in England convinces them to visit him in Australia for their Easter holidays. Once they arrive at the club in [[Sydney]], they find that Jay was lying, and in fact; only works as a toilet attendant and lives in a tent in his Uncle Bryan’s front garden, while Will meets Katie- an old friend from his private school days, who is [[Backpacking (travel)|backpacking]], and she persuades him to join her. Simon, intending to break up with the abusive Lucy over [[Skype]] is then interrupted by Jay's uncle in the background. Thinking Simon asked her to marry him, she excitedly tells him yes.

[[File:Byron Lighthouse looking south 2004-28-12.JPG|thumb|The four main characters drive to [[Byron Bay]], along with the backpackers]]
The next day, the four travel to a youth hostel in [[Byron Bay]], as Will wants to follow Katie there. He attempts to become friends with Ben, one of the backpackers Katie is travelling with, but is unsuccessful when they quickly deduce that he is a tourist, rather than a "traveller". When seated around a campfire, it is implied but not revealed that Jay still misses his ex-girlfriend Jane, and has followed her to Australia to try to win her back. Will and Katie hit it off, to Ben's annoyance as Will mocks his guitar playing. Katie drunkenly seduces Will but then unknowingly to him, passes out as they are in bed together and Will is fingering her. A backpacker girl comes in, sees what is happening and thinking that Will had taken advantage of a now unconscious Katie, wrestles him to the ground, and sets off a "rape alarm" Will's overprotective mother gave to him.

The Inbetweeners and the backpackers visit a water park where, Neil accidentally kills a dolphin and Jay gets Simon into trouble with the parents of some children. It is revealed that Jane was working somewhere at the water park and Jay tries to find her, but another member of staff tells him that she has since left for the outback and that he will "never find her"; leaving him feeling dejected and he finally reveals to the others his longing to reconnect with Jane. Will takes on Ben in a waterslide race on the condition that the loser must strip naked. Neil, who is suffering from [[irritable bowel syndrome|irritable bowels]] tries to alert Will that he is about to soil himself, to which Will ignores him but Neil defecates down the slide Will has just gone down. Will wins the race against Ben, but Neil's poo lands right on his face, causing him to vomit uncontrollably, making everybody evacuate the pool.

Lucy tells Simon via Skype that Jane is working on a [[stud farm]] in the remote settlement of [[Birdsville]], and the boys intend to drive there but Will, trying to become a "traveller" instead of a tourist, gets into an argument with Simon and they part ways. Will stays in Byron Bay in the hopes of getting with Katie while the other three head for Birdsville.

Will struggles to fit in with the "spiritual" activities of the travellers and discovers that Katie is sleeping with multiple people at once including Ben, launching him into one of his foul-mouthed tirades towards them, which leads Katie into having sex with Ben in the hostel dormitory. Regretting his decision, Will books a flight with a local farmer and reunites with the rest of the group in Birdsville.

Their car runs out of fuel in the middle of the desert. The group hold hands together as they realise that they will most likely die, but they are rescued by Jane and her work colleagues. She realises how far Jay came to win her over again, and although she is touched by the gesture, she does not take him back. Back at Jay's uncle's house in Sydney, the boys find that Jay's father and Will's mother have flown out after hearing of their near-death experience. To Will's abject horror his nemesis Mr. Gilbert (their old head of [[sixth form]]) is there too, and is now in a relationship with Will's mother, to the  amusement of the other three friends. Over Skype, Lucy breaks-up with Simon because she has been cheating with, and is now in a relationship with his university "best friend" Pete, which Simon responds to by cheering and abruptly hanging-up on her. The group then drive off to continue travelling in Australia and onto Asia on the journey home.

In a [[Montage (filmmaking)|montage]] during the final credits, the four boys decide to travel onwards to [[Vietnam]], are seen target-shooting guns in [[Cambodia]] and drinking with girls in [[Thailand]]; who are then revealed to be [[ladyboys]] beneath their skirts. Upon their return to the United Kingdom several months later, they all have grown long hair and have gained the "backpacker look", Neil is in a relationship with an older female traveller from the Byron Bay hostel, while Will's mother reveals her engagement to Mr. Gilbert. Will is aghast and attempts to run back onto the plane, but is wrestled to the ground by security.

==Production==

===Origin===
Although originally intended as an unambiguous ending to the television series, the unexpected popularity and box office success of ''The Inbetweeners Movie'' led to speculation over the possibility of a sequel. These rumours began in early September 2011, while the film was still in cinemas, and were denied by its writers and actors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The Inbetweeners deny a film sequel is already planned|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/newsbeat/14793923|accessdate=11 August 2014|work=[[BBC News]]|date=5 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Around the same time, producer [[Christopher Young (producer)|Christopher Young]] openly recognised the possibility of another film based on the series, claiming that "if there is a sequel it will come from the creative elements&amp;nbsp;... We've talked about it. In the short term people are dispersing and doing other things but I'm sure in the medium term a sequel is very possible. It won't be immediate but it's definitely not closed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.screendaily.com/news/uk-ireland/the-inbetweeners-movie-anatomy-of-a-uk-hit/5032152.article|title=The Inbetweeners Movie: Anatomy of a UK hit|last=Wiseman|first=Andreas|date=15 September 2011|publisher=Screendaily.com|accessdate=20 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Co-writer [[Damon Beesley]] later admitted "we didn't know how successful it would be and that it would have a life on screen.

[[Ben Palmer]], the director of the first ''Inbetweeners'' film, was involved with [[Simon Pegg]]'s film ''[[Man Up (film)|Man Up]]'', so Morris and Beesley directed ''The Inbetweeners 2''.&lt;ref name=young/&gt; Bird said that the actors were initially disheartened by the absence of Palmer, and nervous about the direction of Morris and Beesley due to their lack of experience in the position.&lt;ref name=keily/&gt;

Morris had considered filming the Australian scenes in [[South Africa]] due to the comparatively high costs in Australia, which despite a higher budget caused the sequel to have fewer resources than its predecessor.&lt;ref name=keily/&gt; While all locations for the first film had been within 10 minutes of the hotel, locations in the second were separated by a three-hour flight and nine-hour car journey.&lt;ref name=keily/&gt; During filming in the Outback, the Australian crew provided two doctors and 40 litres of IV fluid, although the only point in which a doctor was called was when Buckley thought that he was having a [[heart attack]], which was in reality [[indigestion]] from chips and [[lager]].&lt;ref name=keily/&gt; Beesley considered it "the maniac's choice of a film to be your first film".&lt;ref name=keily/&gt; The water park scenes were filmed at [[Wet'n'Wild Gold Coast]], which Thomas described as "some quite challenging scenes".&lt;ref name=Toomey/&gt;

When asked whether he ever felt averse to any material in the film due to perceived offence, Morris said that the crew's attitude was "let’s shoot everything, push it, and then if it feels like too much when we’re watching it, we can always pull it back in the editing room".&lt;ref name=Toomey/&gt;

[[Robbie Collin]] of ''[[The Daily Telegraph]]'' gave the film four stars out of five, saying "Perhaps the biggest compliment you could pay the film, apart from that it’s by and large hysterically funny, is that it is unmistakably film-like, with a smoothly arcing plot and gross-out moments staged with the verve and ceremony of an action-movie set-piece."&lt;ref name=collin/&gt; In ''[[The Guardian]]'', Mike McCahill gave the film three stars. He found fault in its treatment of female characters, saying "Some of the abundant thought channelled into knob gags could have been diverted towards developing the boys' female counterparts beyond harpies and lust objects". Unlike Collin, he found ''The Inbetweeners 2'' to resemble a television show more than a film: "as with the first film, number 2 never quite shakes its resemblance to primetime E4, complete with ad-ready fadeouts and Walkabout interiors...couldn't the vehicles transporting them to the wider world display slightly more ambition?".&lt;ref name=guardian/&gt; Chris Hewitt of [[Empire (magazine)|''Empire'']] magazine gave the film four stars out of five, summing it up as "[[The Fantastic Four|The Fannytastic Four]] leave us on a poo-flecked, piss-soaked, sun-burned high that more than overcomes its familiar flaws to become a real contender for the year’s funniest film. Four star wankers".&lt;ref name=empire/&gt;

A negative review came from Graham Young of the ''[[Birmingham Mail]]'', who found the film's humour to be repetitive: "Damon Beesley and Iain Morris have both directed this sequel which lacks an emotional arc to create momentum...Yes, it can be funny, and you’d have to be a prude not to laugh...But the endless, alliterative phrases for sex and countless in-your-face sight gags dilute the characters and turn the mood wearingly lewd. Like [[Nick Frost]]’s ''[[Cuban Fury|The Cuban Fury]]'' [''sic''] earlier this year, ''The Inbetweeners 2'' takes a funny premise – and then ruins it."&lt;ref name=young&gt;{{cite news|last1=Young|first1=Graham|title=Film Review: The Inbetweeners 2 (15)|url=http://www.birminghammail.co.uk/whats-on/film-news/film-review-inbetweeners-2-15-7573562|accessdate=8 August 2014|work=[[Birmingham Mail]]|date=6 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Writing in ''[[The Observer]]'', Jonathan Romney gave the film two stars out of five, summing it up as "British TV comedy's favourite [[The Three Stooges|Four Stooges]] take another holiday, resulting in fountainous poo, pee and puke, rampant [[misogyny]], 'ironic' rampant misogyny, rampant 'irony', and that old ''[[Carry On (franchise)|Carry On]]'' staple, horror of sex (especially among the over-25s)". He however predicted that on the record of the first film, ''The Inbetweeners 2'' would be a financial success.&lt;ref name=observer/&gt; In [[Time Out (magazine)|''Time Out'']], Tom Huddleston gave the film one star out of five, saying "‘The Inbetweeners 2’ is riddled with contempt: for its characters, for its audience and most notably for the entire female gender. That a film in 2014 can still get away with depicting all women as either dumb, hapless sluts or ball-busting harridans is frankly unbelievable."&lt;ref name=time/&gt;

In Australia, Matthew Toomey, a film critic for [[612 ABC Brisbane]], gave ''The Inbetweeners 2'' a B+. He said "Don’t expect a deep, underlying narrative. This is just a bunch of horny teenagers doing really dumb things. To each their own... but I was entertained. First and foremost, it shocked me&amp;nbsp;– and that’s not easy given how many movies I watch.

Although opining that the film was "slightly more insensitive to its female leads than previous efforts", he concluded that a scene in which [[faeces]] chase Will down a waterslide "challenges ''[[Caddyshack]]'' for the mantle of 'Best Ever S***&lt;!--sic, don't uncensor as this is a quote--&gt; in Water' gag".&lt;ref name=quick_2&gt;[https://www.quickflix.com.au/News/Reviews/TheInbetweeners2/12285|accessdate=4 December 2015|work=[[Quickflix]]|date=21 August 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the ''[[Herald Sun]]'', Leigh Paatsch gave the film one star. He criticised the casting, describing the main characters as "supposed to be aged about 20 [but] played by blokes who all look as if they’re 30-plus, and carry on as if they’re not yet 10", and also found the film misogynistic, saying "the derogatory manner in which women are spoken of (and often depicted) is relentlessly, callously crass.

==Legacy==
At its premiere on 5 August 2014, Bird said of the film:&lt;ref name=telegraph/&gt;

{{cquote|Once you see the film you'll see it feels like they've all moved on with their lives, so unfortunately this is it. It's a great way to say goodbye.}}

In an interview with the BBC, Thomas said that Morris and Beesley had been "very adamant" that the series had finished. On his co-stars, he added "There is a bond there that I think would be a stupid thing to waste. You don't get that bond very often with other performers and we do have it and it's a valuable thing".&lt;ref name=keily/&gt;

In the same interview, when asked whether the series had finished, both co-creators answered with a simultaneous "Yes!". Morris expressed that "I think the time is right. After the first film, I wanted to hear more from Jay, Will, Neil and Simon. But this time I feel there is enough. There is more than enough Jay in this world", and Beesley added "The end of the story has always felt like the time where they go off and start living their adult life. And I think this film takes us up to that point".&lt;ref name=keily/&gt;

Various media outlets blamed ''The Inbetweeners 2'' for an increase in a craze of deliberate [[defecation]] in swimming pools to distress other guests. They linked the craze, known as "logging" or "Code Brown", to a scene akin to it in the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=https://www.mirror.co.uk/news/uk-news/inbetweeners-pool-poo-prank-leaves-4352927 | title=Inbetweeners pool poo prank leaves mum with dangerous virus | work=Daily Mirror | date=30 September 2014 | accessdate=2 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Falk|first1=Ben|title=INBETWEENERS 2 INSPIRES DISGUSTING 'LOGGING' CRAZE|url=https://au.movies.yahoo.com/on-show/article/-/24759872/inbetweeners-2-inspires-disgusting-logging-craze/|accessdate=26 August 2014|publisher=Yahoo|date=20 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disgusting Inbetweeners movie stunt sees 'logging' craze feature at holiday resorts|url=http://www.bathchronicle.co.uk/Disgusting-Inbetweeners-stunt-begins-logging/story-22718625-detail/story.html|accessdate=26 August 2014|work=[[Bath Chronicle]]|date=13 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Inbetweeners gag leaves Sevenoaks mum, Zara Farrant with stomach-bug hell after teenagers defecated in holiday swimming pool|url=http://www.kentonline.co.uk/sevenoaks/news/inbetweeners-gag-sparks-stomach-bug-24273/|accessdate=4 June 2015|work=Kent Online|date=29 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Waugh|first1=Rob|title=Mum catches lethal bug after teens copy Inbetweeners ‘logging’ stunt in pool|url=http://metro.co.uk/2014/10/01/mum-catches-lethal-bug-after-teens-copy-inbetweeners-logging-stunt-in-pool-4888804/|accessdate=4 June 2015|work=[[Metro (British newspaper)|Metro]]|date=1 October 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Plot==
The evil sorcerer Rothbart ([[Jack Palance]]) is planning to take King William's ([[Dakin Matthews]]) kingdom for himself by mastering a type of [[Black magic|dark magic]] known as The Forbidden Arts. Before he can strike, Rothbart is arrested by William's men. Despite calls for his death, King William spares Rothbart's life and banishes him. A hateful Rothbart swears to William that he will get his power back and take everything William owns and loves. William and Queen Uberta ([[Sandy Duncan]]) make their children, Odette and Derek, meet every summer, hoping they'll fall in love. When they meet for the first time, the royal children take an immediate dislike for each other, but as the years pass they gradually fall in love.

In the present time, Derek ([[Howard McGillin]]) only expresses love for Odette's ([[Michelle Nicastro]]) beauty, and she and her father leave disappointed. On their journey home, they are ambushed by the vengeful Rothbart, who transforms into a "Great Animal" with his new powers, kidnapping Odette and fatally injuring William. Derek arrives on the scene and William tells him Great Animal ("It's not what it seems"), and that Odette is gone. He dies in Derek's hands. After searching and finding no sign of Odette, the entire kingdom assumes that she's dead. Uberta encourages her son to find another princess, but Derek is determined to find Odette, believing that she still lives. He and his only friend Bromley ([[Joel McKinnon Miller]]) practice hunting every day in preparation to face the Great Animal. Elsewhere, Rothbart is keeping Odette at his castle lair at Swan Lake. He has cast a powerful spell that turns Odette into a [[swan]] during the day. At night, she can become human temporarily if she is on the lake when the moonlight touches it. Every night, Rothbart asks Odette to marry him so he can rule William's kingdom legally, but she refuses, then the moonlight leaves the lake, and she turns back into a swan. During her captivity, she befriends a [[turtle]] named Speed ([[Steven Wright]]), a French [[frog]] named Jean-Bob ([[John Cleese]]), who claims to be a prince, and an Irish [[puffin]] ([[Steve Vinovich]]).

Puffin and Odette (in her swan form) fly together to find Derek. By chance, they stumble upon Derek in the woods as he is searching for the Great Animal. Derek mistakes Odette for the Great Animal (having deduced that the creature is a [[shapeshifter]]), and tries to kill her. The ensuing chase leads Derek to Swan Lake, where he witnesses Odette's change from swan to human when the moon rises. The two share a loving reunion, and Odette tells Derek that the spell can only be broken by a vow of everlasting love. Derek invites Odette to his mother's ball the following night, hoping to declare to the world of his love for her. Derek leaves just as Rothbart arrives and doesn't know the enchanter heard the whole conversation. Rothbart tells Odette that she will never make it to the ball, for there will be [[new moon|"no moon"]] on that night, much to her dismay and sorrow. Later, inside his castle, fearing that Derek's vow would ruin his plans, Rothbart decides to transform his hag sidekick, Bridget, to the point that she appears to be Odette, ensuring that if Derek made the vow to her as the wrong woman, Odette will die. On the night of the ball, Rothbart imprisons Odette (in swan form) in the dungeon of his castle, along with Bromley, whom he had found in the woods the other night. Bridget, in the form of human Odette, arrives at Uberta's ball where she dances with Derek, who is unaware of her true identity.

At Swan Lake, Puffin, Speed and Jean-Bob manage to free Odette from the dungeon through a duel with two hungry [[alligator]]s and she flies to Uberta's castle, but is too late. Derek makes the vow of everlasting love to the wrong girl and Rothbart bursts in, revealing to Derek the fake's true form, Bridget. Realizing his mistake, Derek races after Odette back to Swan Lake, where she finally transforms back into her human form. As Derek holds a dying Odette in his arms, she tells him she loves him before losing consciousness. A furious Derek confronts Rothbart, demanding him to undo the spell, but the sorcerer declares to the prince "Only if you defeat... me!" Rothbart transforms into the Great Animal, and a battle ensues with Rothbart overpowering Derek. Odette's animal friends return Derek's bow to him, and Bromley, who has also escaped the dungeon, provides Derek with a single arrow. Derek catches and fires the arrow into the Great Animal's heart, killing him.

A heart-broken Derek confesses his love to Odette, and she wakes up, having managed to survive long enough for the sorcerer's defeat; the spell on her is broken. Derek and Odette get married and they, Uberta, King William’s servants, Bromley, and the animals move into Rothbart's former castle, where they live happily ever after.

==Production==
Having previously directed ''[[The Fox and the Hound]]'' (1981) and ''[[The Black Cauldron (film)|The Black Cauldron]]'' (1985), Richard Rich was slated to co-direct ''[[Oliver &amp; Company]]'' (1988) until he was fired by Disney feature animation president [[Peter Schneider (film executive)|Peter Schneider]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite AV media|people=[[Don Hahn|Hahn, Don]]|title=[[Waking Sleeping Beauty]]|medium=Documentary film|publisher=Stone Circle Pictures/Walt Disney Studios Motion Pictures|location=Burbank, California|date=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Following his departure from Disney, he subsequently formed his own studio, Rich Animation Studios with about 26 employees, in which most of his key employees came from [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]], including the company's marketing chief, Matt Mazer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Citron|first=Rich|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1993-12-21/business/fi-4238_1_animated-films|title=Rich Hopes to Strike It in Animation|publisher=Los Angeles Times|date=December 21, 1993|accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently, Jared F. Brown from [[Living Scriptures, Inc.]] tapped Rich into producing half-hour animated videos based on the audio cassettes readings of the [[Book of Mormon]].&lt;ref name="StandardExaminer"&gt;{{cite news|last=Porter|first=Donald|url=http://theoccasionalcritic.blogspot.com/2012/11/richard-rich-nov-19-1994.html|title=Richard Rich|work=[[Standard-Examiner]]|publisher=Blogger|date=November 19, 1994|accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inspired by the success of [[Don Bluth]]'s animated films as well as Disney's [[Disney Renaissance|early-1990s animation renaissance]], Rich decided to adapt the German folk tale version of ''Swan Lake''. During production, the script went through twelve drafts over the course of two years. Rich would later attempt to sell his script to several Hollywood studios to no success.&lt;ref name="DeseretNews"&gt;{{cite news|last=Hicks|first=Chris|url=https://www.deseretnews.com/article/388304/THE-SWAN-PRINCESS.html|title=The Swan Princess|publisher=[[Deseret News]]|date=November 18, 1994|accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Later, Brown struck on the idea on merging Rich Animation Studios, Family Entertainment Network, and Cassette Duplicators Inc., a [[Loop bin duplicator|cassette-duplicating]] operation in [[West Valley City, Utah|West Valley City]], into one production holding company called [[Nest Family Entertainment]].&lt;ref name="StandardExaminer" /&gt;

The film was created by hand painting cels, a tedious technique which caused Rich and his crew to take over four years to produce the final product.&lt;ref name="reelviews1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/s/swan_princess.html|title=Review: The Swan Princess|publisher=Reel Views|accessdate=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=XD2xNKSN3E8C&amp;pg=PA295&amp;dq=%22The+Swan+Princess%22+rich&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=1hlqU57DGcHKkgXMmoDoBg&amp;ved=0CDMQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22The%20Swan%20Princess%22%20rich&amp;f=false |title=Hollywood Musicals Year by Year - Stanley Green - Google Books |publisher=Books.google.com.au|accessdate=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Overall, 275 animators and artists worked throughout the film's production.&lt;ref name="DeseretNews" /&gt;

==Music==
{{Main|The Swan Princess (soundtrack)}}
[[David Zippel]] was approached by Richard Rich to compose songs for ''The Swan Princess'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Longsdorf|first=Amy|title=Lyricist David Zippel Helping To Put The Tune In Cartoons|url=http://articles.mcall.com/1994-12-17/entertainment/3000629_1_david-zippel-disney-films-swan|publisher=''[[The Morning Call]]''|date=December 17, 1994|accessdate=February 17, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; while the score was composed by [[Lex de Azevedo]].

The theme song "[[Far Longer than Forever]]" was written by lyricists by de Azevedo and Zippel. In the 1994 animated film, the song was performed by [[Singing|vocalists]] [[Liz Callaway]] (as the singing voice of Princess Odette) and [[Howard McGillin]] (as the speaking and singing voice of Prince Derek). In the closing credits, a pop/[[contemporary R&amp;B|R&amp;B]] rendition of the song was performed by recording artists [[Regina Belle]] and [[Jeffrey Osborne]]. Michelle Nicastro sings a reprise of the song in the 1997 sequel, ''Escape From Castle Mountain.''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nE8OAQAAMAAJ&amp;q=%22far+longer+than+forever%22&amp;dq=%22far+longer+than+forever%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CDEQ6AEwBTgKahUKEwiPv5Cx49zGAhXMlQ0KHWjzBO0|title=The Motion Picture Guide, 1998 Annual|work=google.com.au}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
===Critical reaction===
At the time of its theatrical release, ''The Swan Princess'' received favorable reviews.&lt;ref name="SwanSticksItsNeck" /&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' gave the film three out of four stars, saying "Despite the comparatively limited resources at his disposal, Richard Rich shows that he understands the recent Disney animated renaissance and can create some of the same magic. The movie isn't in the same league as Disney's big four, and it doesn't have the same crossover appeal to adults, but as family entertainment, it's bright and cheerful, and it has its moments."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Ebert|first=Roger|url=http://www.rogerebert.com/reviews/the-swan-princess-1994|title=The Swan Princess Movie Review (1994)|work=Chicago Sun-Times|date=November 18, 1994|accessdate=March 16, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Hal Hinson of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' said it was a better film than ''The Lion King'', praising its "fluid, unhurried pace" and "lush, original sense of color," though deeming the score "[not] terribly distinctive."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Hinson|first=Hal|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/theswanprincessghinson_a0a8b3.htm|title=‘The Swan Princess’ (G)|publisher=''The Washington Post''|date=November 19, 1994|accessdate=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Brian Lowry of ''[[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]'' said the film was "technically impressive but rather flat and languid storywise."&lt;ref name="variety1994"/&gt; [[James Berardinelli]] of ''ReelViews'' gave the film 2.5 stars of 4 writing that "much of ''The Swan Princess'' is trite and uninspired," though added "nevertheless, despite its problems, ''The Swan Princess'' is actually one of the better non-Disney animated productions to come along in a while."&lt;ref name="reelviews1"/&gt; [[Gene Siskel]] of ''[[The Chicago Tribune]]'' gave the film two out of four stars writing the film is a "casually drawn tale of a boring prince and princess tormented by a dull sorcerer. The songs are weak, and no relationship is developed between the principals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Siskel|first=Gene|url=http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1994-11-18/entertainment/9411180356_1_dylan-mcdermott-star-seduction|title='Last Seduction' Proves Dahl Is Very Good At Going Bad|publisher=''Chicago Tribune''|date=November 18, 1994|accessdate=February 6, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; On the review aggregator website [[Rotten Tomatoes]], ''The Swan Princess'' has an approval rating of 50%, based on 10 reviews, with an average score of 5.4/10.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/swan_princess|title=The Swan Princess|work=[[Rotten Tomatoes]]|publisher=[[Flixster]]|accessdate=October 20, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Box office===
''The Swan Princess'' received a theatrical release in the United States on November 18, 1994, and only made $2,445,155 on its opening weekend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Welkos|first=Richard|title=Weekend Box Office : Appealing to All 'Generations'|publisher=[[Los Angeles Times]]|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-11-22/entertainment/ca-165_1_weekend-box-office-chart|accessdate=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; It eventually had a total domestic gross of $9,771,658 against a $21 million budget, becoming a huge [[box office bomb|financial disappointment]], partly due to struggling competition with a re-release of ''[[The Lion King]]'' (1994).&lt;ref name="SwanSticksItsNeck"&gt;{{cite news|last=Bates|first=James|title=Company Town : 'Swan' Sticks Its Neck Out but Still Gets the Ax : Film: Poor box office opening resurrects age-old question: Can an animated movie be a hit if it isn't made by Disney?|publisher=Los Angeles Times|url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-11-22/business/fi-468_1_animated-film|accessdate=June 5, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="UPI95"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.upi.com/Archives/1995/04/03/Walt-Disney-Co-in-a-bid-to-continue-its/8510796881600/|title=Walt Disney Co., in a bid to continue its...|work=UPI|access-date=2017-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Disney's reissuing of ''The Lion King'' just as this film was being released was seen as "sabotage" by ''Variety''.&lt;ref name="variety1994"&gt;{{cite web|author=Brian Lowry|url=https://variety.com/1994/film/reviews/the-swan-princess-1200439278/|title=The Swan Princess|publisher=''Variety''|date=November 20, 1994|accessdate=May 7, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2476">The '''''Vitulatio''''' was an annual [[wikt:thanksgiving|thanksgiving]] celebrated in [[ancient Rome]] on July 8, the day after the ''[[Caprotinia|Nonae Caprotinae]]'' and following the [[Poplifugia]] on July 5. The Poplifugia is a lesser-known festival that was of obscure origin even for the Romans themselves; [[Macrobius]] says that it marked a Roman retreat from the Etruscans at [[Fidenae]] during the [[Battle of the Allia|Gallic invasion]], and that the Vitulatio commemorated their comeback victory. It was a ''[[dies religiosus]],'' a day of religious prohibition when people were to refrain from undertaking any activity other than attending to basic necessities.&lt;ref&gt;[[H.H. Scullard]], ''Festivals and Ceremonies of the Roman Republic'' (Cornell University Press, 1981), pp. 163, 45–46.&lt;/ref&gt;

The verb ''vitulari'' meant to chant or recite a formula with a joyful intonation and rhythm.&lt;ref&gt;Macrobius, ''Saturnalia'' [http://penelope.uchicago.edu/Thayer/L/Roman/Texts/Macrobius/Saturnalia/3*.html#2.10 III 2,12.]&lt;/ref&gt; Macrobius says ''vitulari'' is the equivalent of Greek ''paianizein'' (παιανίζειν), "to sing a [[paean]]," a song expressing triumph or thanksgiving.&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London, 1908), p. 179'; Robert Turcan, ''The Gods of Ancient Rome'' (Routledge, 2001), p. 75.&lt;/ref&gt; He offers, however, an [[antiquarianism#Ancient Rome|antiquarian]] range of etymologies, including one from ''victoria,'' "victory."  A goddess '''Vitula''', possibly an invention to explain the name, embodied joy, or perhaps life ''(vita)''. According to [[Vergil]],&lt;ref&gt;Vergil, ''Georgics'' 3.77.&lt;/ref&gt; she received [[first fruits]] offerings. One modern explanation relates the word ''Vitulatio'' to ''vitulus,'' "[[wikt:heifer|heifer]]," the animal that served as a ritual [[scapegoat]] at [[Iguvium]], as described by the [[Iguvine Tablets]].&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies,'' p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

By the [[Roman Republic|late Republic]], the Vitulatio, like the other festivals held July 5–8, seems to have been eclipsed by the popularity of the [[Ludi Apollinares]], games ''([[ludi]])'' held in honor of [[Apollo]] July 6–13.&lt;ref&gt;Scullard, ''Festivals and Ceremonies,'' p. 163.&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2880">The '''Winchester Hat Fair''' is the UK's longest running festival of [[Street Theatre]], [[comedy]], and [[music]] which is held in [[Winchester]], [[United Kingdom]], always during the first weekend in July.&lt;ref name=Blake&gt;{{cite book|title=The Land Without Music|author=Andrew Blake|pages=195|publisher=Manchester University Press|year=1997|isbn=9780719042997}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Lonely Planet Western Europe|author=Ryan Ver Berkmoes|chapter=Winchester|pages=188|publisher=Lonely Planet|year=2007|isbn=9781741042344}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Originally a buskers' fair, the first Hat Fair was held in 1974.  Although the City Council and the local business community initially opposed it, they now support the event, which brings about 40,000 people to watch. The Hat Fair's organizing and co-ordinating committee, which is also local to the city, has charge over the travelling players who converge from around the country and abroad to perform at the Hat Fair.&lt;ref name=Blake /&gt;&lt;ref name=Mason&gt;{{cite book|title=Street Theatre and Other Outdoor Performance|author=Bim Mason|pages=193&amp;ndash;194|publisher=Routledge|year=1992|isbn=9780415070508}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first Hat Fair emerged from an informal gathering of friends, who tried out their new shows upon audiences, and who were paid by donations of money into a hat &amp;mdash; from which practice the 'Hat' Fair got its name.  The core group included members of the Winchester-based Attic Theatre Company, founded and directed by mime artist Jonathan Kay, who continues in the role of Founder and Artistic Director of the Hat Fair to the present day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/hampshire/content/articles/2008/07/11/hatfair_jonathan_kay_feature.shtml BBC Hampshire Profile: The Mad Hatter]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Over the years, the Hat Fair gained enough status that it was able to obtain funding from regional arts funders and the local authorities, as well as commercial sponsors.

The aim of the Hat Fair's organizers is to continually raise the standards of UK Street Theatre, and to aid artists in their development from [[busker]]s to professional performers, by providing them with hospitality, conducive performing conditions, and, if possible, a small fee for their performances.  

Early fairs involved an evening of cabaret in which some of the best acts were showcased. Gradually, this expanded from one evening to four nights, in addition to a series of workshops aimed at developing local talent, and a [[street party]] on the Hat Fair's last night.&lt;ref name=Mason /&gt;

In [[French cuisine]], '''''à la zingara''''' ([[French language|lit.]] "gypsy style"), sometimes spelled as '''''à la singara''''',&lt;ref name="Tennessee 1877"/&gt; is a [[garnish (food)|garnish]] or [[sauce]] consisting of chopped [[ham]], [[Beef tongue|tongue]], [[edible mushroom|mushrooms]] and [[truffles]] combined with [[tomato sauce]], [[tarragon]] and sometimes [[Madeira wine|madeira]].&lt;ref name="Senn 1908 p. 209"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Escoffier 1941"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Sinclair 2009"/&gt; Additional ingredients may include white wine, cayenne pepper, lemon juice and orange [[Peel (fruit)|rind]].&lt;ref name="Ranhofer 1916"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Clissold Pub Company 1916"/&gt; The sauce is prepared by cooking the ingredients until the mixture [[reduction (cooking)|reduces]] and thickens.&lt;ref name="Senn 1915"/&gt; This garnish is served with meat such as veal,&lt;ref name="Ranhofer 1916"/&gt; poultry and sometimes eggs.

'''Gypsy sauce''' ([[German language|German]]: '''Zigeunersauce''')&lt;ref name="The Local-2"/&gt; may have originated from à la zingara. Gypsy sauce is prepared using many of the same ingredients as à la zingara. Simpler versions of gypsy sauce, including commercial varieties, typically use a lesser amount of ingredients, such as [[tomato paste]], Hungarian [[paprika]], [[bell pepper]]s and sometimes onion.

==À la zingara==
À la zingara has sometimes been referred to as '''singara''' and '''zingara sauce'''.&lt;ref name="Escoffier 1941"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Ranhofer 1916"/&gt; Conversely, à la zingara has also been referred to as separate from zingara sauce, such as in the 2009 book ''Dictionary of Food'' authored by Charles Sinclair and published by [[Bloomsbury Publishing]],&lt;ref name="Sinclair 2009"/&gt;{{efn|The ''Dictionary of Food'' was also published by [[A &amp; C Black]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="WorldCat"/&gt;}} which has separate entries for à la zingara and zingara sauce, referring to à la zingara as "''France'' In the gypsy style, i.e. with ham, tongue, mushrooms and tomatoes" and zingara sauce as "''France'' A sauce for veal and poultry made to a variety of recipes and little used."&lt;ref name="Sinclair 2009"/&gt;

An 1869 recipe for blonde veal cutlets with ham à la zingara uses [[espagnole sauce]] and ham.&lt;ref name="Gouffé &amp; Ronjat 1869"/&gt; The espagnole sauce is cooked with the veal, and then later the fat is skimmed from the sauce, which is then run through a [[sieve]], after which it is served with the dish.&lt;ref name="Gouffé &amp; Ronjat 1869"/&gt; An 1858 recipe for veal cutlets a la zingara is similar, with the addition of mushrooms and truffles in the center of the dish surrounding the veal and ham.&lt;ref name="Francatelli 1858"/&gt; After the meats are cooked and plated, The espagnole sauce is cooked in the pan the veal was cooked in, lemon juice and cayenne pepper are added, and then the sauce is poured over the cutlets.&lt;ref name="Francatelli 1858"/&gt;

==Gypsy sauce==
Gypsy sauce is a [[sauce]] or [[demi-glace]] sauce used as an ingredient in dishes and as a [[condiment]].&lt;ref name="GSF-1"/&gt; The term "zigeuner" has been used in Germany for over a century regarding the sauce.&lt;ref name="The Local-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraaf.nl 2013"/&gt; Some companies [[Mass production|mass-produce]] it, including [[Remia]], Verstegen and [[Unilever]].&lt;ref name="telegraaf.nl 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Online 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Local 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Focus2016-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knorr.de"/&gt; Some controversy occurred in 2013 regarding use of the word "gypsy" on the labels of commercial varieties of the sauce and at German public building cafeterias.&lt;ref name="The Local-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boulter 2015"/&gt;

===Etymology===
{{see also|Antiziganism#Etymology}}
The term ''zigeuner'' has been used for over 100 years in Germany in reference to the sauce.&lt;ref name="The Local-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="telegraaf.nl 2013"/&gt; This term was used in the 1903 book ''[[Le guide culinaire]]'' written by [[Auguste Escoffier]]&lt;ref name="Nachrichtenfernsehen 2013"/&gt;

Gypsy sauce is used in [[Austrian cuisine|Austrian]], [[French cuisine|French]] and [[German cuisine]].&lt;ref name="The Local-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="GSF-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pohl 2008"/&gt;

===Preparation===
Contemporary gypsy sauce is typically prepared using [[tomato paste]], Hungarian [[paprika]], [[bell pepper]]s&lt;ref name="McGavin 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Spohn 2012"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Curtis 2008"/&gt; and sometimes onion.&lt;ref name="The Local 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times 2009"/&gt; It may be prepared as a spicy-hot sauce.&lt;ref name="McGavin 2010"/&gt; Canned whole or crushed tomatoes are sometimes used.&lt;ref name="Curtis 2008"/&gt; Additional ingredients used in its preparation include onion, garlic, [[chicken broth]], milk, a sweetener such as sugar or honey, salt and pepper.&lt;ref name="McGavin 2010"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Curtis 2008"/&gt;

Another preparation of the sauce includes tomato slices or tomato purée, onions, smoked [[tongue#As food|tongue]], ham, mushrooms, [[truffle]]s, white wine or [[Madeira wine]], butter, paprika and pepper,&lt;ref name="GSF-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Pohl 2008"/&gt; which is very similar to the preparation of à la zingara. The simpler preparation of the sauce may have originated from the more complex à la zingara sauce.{{efn|"Die mit Paprika und Tomaten angerührte Zigeunersoße der fast foodindustrie unterscheidet sich erheblich von den Schlemmereien à la zingara vergangener Zeiten, bei denen zu dieser Zubereitungsart Trüffeln gehörten."{{de icon}}&lt;ref name="Hund 2000"/&gt;}}{{efn|"Zingara zigeunersauce: demi-glace mit Tomatenpüree Madeirawein, Schinkenstreifwen, Champignons, Trüffelen and Pökelzunge" {{de icon}}&lt;ref name="GSF-1"/&gt;}}

===Production===
Gypsy sauce is commercially [[Mass production|mass-produced]] by some companies, such as [[Remia]], Verstegen and [[Unilever]], which is marketed under Unilever's [[Knorr (brand)|Knorr]] brand name&lt;ref name="telegraaf.nl 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Online 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Local 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Focus2016-1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Knorr.de"/&gt;

===Use in dishes===
Gypsy sauce is used in the preparation of ''[[Schnitzel#Germany|Zigeunerschnitzel]]'', a German [[schnitzel]] dish.&lt;ref name="Los Angeles Times 2009"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Dr. Oetker Verlag 2013"/&gt;

===Name controversy===
In August 2013, a group representing [[Romani people|Romani]] and [[Sinti]] peoples called for commercial varieties of the sauce to be renamed, stating that use of the word ''gypsy'' is offensive and discriminatory, and has negative connotations.&lt;ref name="The Local 2013"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heine 2015"/&gt; The group requested that five German food companies rename the sauce, suggesting using the name "spicy sauce" or another similar name.&lt;ref name="Online 2016"/&gt;&lt;ref name="The Local 2013"/&gt; Authorities in [[Hanover]], Germany issued an internal memo in October 2013 informing city staffers that they should avoid using the term to describe a type of schnitzel served in the [[cafeteria]]s of city-run public buildings, instead calling it "Balkan style" or "Budapest style".&lt;ref name="The Local-2"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Boulter 2015"/&gt; During this time, food manufacturers essentially opposed renaming the commercial brands of the sauce. The German Association of Culinary Foodstuffs Manufacturers stated through a spokesperson that the sauce has significant [[brand recognition]] under this name, and that the word ''gypsy'' has been used for over 100 years to represent the sauce.&lt;ref name="The Local-2"/&gt;
