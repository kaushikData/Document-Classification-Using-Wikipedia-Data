In [[mathematics]], the '''abscissa''' ({{IPAc-en|æ|b|ˈ|s|ɪ|s|.|ə}}; plural ''abscissae'' or ''abscissæ'' or ''abscissas'') and the '''ordinate''' are respectively the first and second [[coordinate]] of a [[Point (geometry)|point]] in a [[coordinate system]].

The '''abscissa''' of a point is the signed [[Measurement|measure]] of its projection on the primary axis, whose absolute value is the distance between the projection and the origin of the axis, and whose sign is given by the location on the projection relative to the origin (before: negative; after: positive).

The '''ordinate''' of a point is the signed [[Measurement|measure]] of its projection on the secondary axis, whose absolute value is the distance between the projection and the origin of the axis, and whose sign is given by the location on the projection relative to the origin (before: negative; after: positive).

Usually these are the horizontal and vertical coordinates of a point in a two-dimensional rectangular [[Cartesian coordinate system]].  The terms can also refer to the horizontal and vertical axes respectively (typically ''x''-axis and ''y''–axis) of a two-dimensional graph.  An [[ordered pair]] consists of two terms—the abscissa (horizontal, usually ''x'') and the ordinate (vertical, usually ''y'')—which define the location of a point in two-dimensional rectangular space.  

:&lt;math&gt;(\overbrace{x}^\text{abscissa}, \overbrace{y}^\text{ordinate})&lt;/math&gt;

== Etymology ==

Though the word "abscissa" (Latin; "linea abscissa", "a line cut off") has been used at least since ''De Practica Geometrie'' published in 1220 by [[Fibonacci]] (Leonardo of Pisa), its use in its modern sense may be due to Venetian mathematician [[Stefano degli Angeli]] in his work ''Miscellaneum Hyperbolicum, et Parabolicum'' of 1659.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title =On the Word "Abscissa" |website =numberwarrior.wordpress.com |last=Dyer |first=Jason |publisher = The number Warrior |date = March 8, 2009 |url = https://numberwarrior.wordpress.com/2009/03/08/on-the-word-abscissa/ |accessdate = September 10, 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1892 work ''Vorlesungen über Geschichte der Mathematik, Volume 2,'' ("''Lectures on history of mathematics''") German historian of mathematics  [[Moritz Cantor]] writes

:"Wir kennen keine ältere Benutzung des Wortes Abssisse in lateinischen Originalschriften [than degli Angeli's]. Vielleicht kommt das Wort in Übersetzungen der [[Apollonius_of_Perga|Apollonischen Kegelschnitte]] vor, wo Buch I Satz 20 von ''ἀποτεμνομέναις'' die Rede ist, wofür es kaum ein entsprechenderes lateinisches Wort als ''abscissa'' geben möchte."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Vorlesungen über Geschichte der Mathematik, Volume 2 |last=Cantor |first=Moritz |year=1900 |publisher=B.G. Teubner |location= Leipzig |page=898 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=LejuAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA898&amp;lpg=PA898&amp;dq=%22Miscellaneum+Hyperbolicum,+et+Parabolicum.%22+%22abscissa%22&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=gUXz-_IZhC&amp;sig=v2-RKHUt3CkqWh2EgxBhIbc9JcY&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CCsQ6AEwAmoVChMIrY3q_8rtxwIVQaGACh29JQuB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22Miscellaneum%20Hyperbolicum%2C%20et%20Parabolicum.%22%20%22abscissa%22&amp;f=false |accessdate=10 September 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
 
:"We know no earlier use of the word abscissa in Latin originals [than degli Angeli's]. Maybe the word descends from translations of the [[Apollonius_of_Perga|Apollonian conics]], where in Book I, Chapter 20 there appears ''ἀποτεμνομέναις,'' for which there would hardly be as an appropriate Latin word as ''abscissa.''"

==In parametric equations==
In a somewhat obsolete variant usage, the abscissa of a point may also refer to any number that describes the point's location along some path, e.g. the parameter of a [[parametric equation]].&lt;ref name="WolframAlpha"&gt;{{cite web |last=Hedegaard |first=Rasmus |last2=Weisstein |first2=Eric W. |title=Abscissa |work=[[MathWorld]] |url=http://mathworld.wolfram.com/Abscissa.html |accessdate=14 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Used in this way, the abscissa can be thought of as a coordinate-geometry analog to the [[Independent_variable#Independent_variable|independent variable]] in a [[mathematical model]] or experiment (with any ordinates filling a role analogous to [[Dependent and independent variables#Dependent_variable|dependent variables]]).

'''Adhikārivāda''' is the [[doctrine]] of special rights and privileges with regard to the right to universal [[knowledge]] of the [[Upanishads]]. 

[[Vivekananda]] rejected this doctrine which, in his view, was the outcome of pure [[selfishness]] and ignored both the infinite possibilities of the [[human]] [[soul]] and the fact that all men are capable of receiving knowledge if it is imparted in their own respective [[language]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Complete Works of Swami Vivekananda Vol.5|publisher=Kartindo.com|page=361|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=AAGNAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA361&amp;lpg=PA361&amp;dq=adhikarivada&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=Hd1g1wRqYv&amp;sig=a8cfyj_VJk53Ed_zvYqf4WczlWM&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WO2QVNPZB4WNuAS2qoL4Aw&amp;ved=0CB4Q6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=adhikarivada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; Therefore, he claimed, there is no reason for access to the universal knowledge of the Upanishads to be restricted on the basis of [[caste]] or [[religion]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Dalit’s Inheritance in Hindu Religion|author=Mahendra Singh|publisher=Gyan Publishing|page=63|url= https://books.google.co.in/books?id=7CoelGoA6l8C&amp;pg=PA341&amp;lpg=PA341&amp;dq=adhikarivada&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=vgJy6_sCBH&amp;sig=6nZYD6YbHb5k2osjhxJIvj4la2U&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=WO2QVNPZB4WNuAS2qoL4Aw&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=adhikarivada&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Arthur Stanley Eddington.jpg|thumb|[[Arthur Stanley Eddington]]]]

The '''Arrow of Time''', or '''Time's Arrow''', is the concept of the "one-way direction" or "asymmetry" of [[time]]. It was
developed in 1927 by the British astronomer [[Arthur Eddington]], and is an unsolved general [[physics]] question. This direction, according to Eddington, can be determined by studying the organization of [[Atom|atoms]], [[Molecule|molecules]], and bodies, and might be drawn upon a [[Four-dimensional space|four-dimensional]] relativistic map of the world (''"a solid block of paper"'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book
|title=The scientist as philosopher: philosophical consequences of great scientific discoveries
|first1=Friedel
|last1=Weinert
|publisher=Springer
|year=2005
|isbn=3-540-21374-0
|page=143
|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=-R4ANHu-csMC}}, [https://books.google.com/books?id=-R4ANHu-csMC&amp;pg=PA143 Chapter 4, p. 143]
&lt;/ref&gt;

Physical processes at the [[microscopic]] level are believed to be either entirely or mostly [[T-symmetry|time-symmetric]]: if the direction of time were to reverse, the theoretical statements that describe them would remain true. Yet at the [[macroscopic]] level it often appears that this is not the case: there is an obvious direction (or ''flow'') of time.

== Eddington ==
In the 1928 book ''The Nature of the Physical World'', which helped to popularize the concept, Eddington stated:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Let us draw an arrow arbitrarily.  If as we follow the arrow we find more and more of the random element in the state of the world, then the arrow is pointing towards the future; if the random element decreases the arrow points towards the past.  That is the only distinction known to [[physics]].  This follows at once if our fundamental contention is admitted that the introduction of randomness is the only thing which cannot be undone.  I shall use the phrase ‘time's arrow’ to express this one-way property of time which has no analogue in space.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Eddington then gives three points to note about this arrow:

# It is vividly recognized by [[consciousness]].
# It is equally insisted on by our reasoning faculty, which tells us that a reversal of the arrow would render the external world nonsensical.
# It makes no appearance in physical science except in the study of organization of a number of individuals. (By which he means that it is only observed in entropy, a statistical mechanics phenomenon arising from a system.)

According to Eddington the arrow indicates the direction of progressive increase of the random element.  Following a lengthy argument upon the nature of [[thermodynamics]] he concludes that, so far as physics is concerned, time's arrow is a property of [[entropy]] alone.

== Overview ==
The symmetry of time ([[T-symmetry]]) can be understood by a simple analogy: if time were perfectly symmetrical, a video of real events would seem realistic whether played forwards or backwards.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.isepp.org/Pages/01-02%20Pages/Albert.html David Albert on ''Time and Chance'']&lt;/ref&gt;  An obvious objection to this notion is [[gravity]]: things fall down, not up.  Yet a ball that is tossed up, slows to a stop, and falls into the hand is a case where recordings would look equally realistic  forwards and backwards.  The system is T-symmetrical, but while going "forward", [[kinetic energy]] is dissipated and entropy is increased.  Entropy may be one of the few processes that is [[Irreversibility|not time-reversible]].  According to the statistical notion of increasing entropy, the "arrow" of time is identified with a decrease of free energy.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal

== Arrows ==

=== The thermodynamic arrow of time ===
{{Main article|Entropy (arrow of time)}}
The arrow of time is the "one-way direction" or "asymmetry" of time.  The thermodynamic arrow of time is provided by the [[second law of thermodynamics]], which says that in an isolated system, entropy tends to increase with time.  Entropy can be thought of as a measure of microscopic disorder; thus the second law implies that time is asymmetrical with respect to the amount of order in an isolated system: as a system advances through time, it becomes more statistically disordered.  This asymmetry can be used empirically to distinguish between future and past, though measuring entropy does not accurately measure time.  Also, in an open system, entropy can decrease with time.

British physicist [[Brian Pippard|Sir Alfred Brian Pippard]] wrote, "There is thus no justification for the view, often glibly repeated, that the Second Law of Thermodynamics is only statistically true, in the sense that microscopic violations repeatedly occur, but never violations of any serious magnitude.  On the contrary, no evidence has ever been presented that the Second Law breaks down under any circumstances."&lt;ref&gt;A. B. Pippard, Elements of Chemical Thermodynamics for Advanced Students of Physics (1966), p.100.&lt;/ref&gt;  However, there are a number of paradoxes regarding [[second law of thermodynamics#Controversies|violation of the second law of thermodynamics]], one of them due to the [[Poincaré recurrence theorem]].

This arrow of time seems to be related to all other arrows of time and arguably underlies some of them, with the exception of the [[#The particle physics (weak) arrow of time|weak arrow of time]].

[[Harold F. Blum|Harold Blum]]'s 1951 book ''Time's Arrow and Evolution''&lt;ref name="Blum1951"&gt;{{cite book|last=Blum|first=Harold F.|authorlink=Harold F. Blum|title=Time's Arrow and Evolution|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=tmcNnwEACAAJ|edition=First|year=1951}}&lt;/ref&gt; "explored the relationship between time's arrow (the second law of thermodynamics) and organic evolution."  This influential text explores "irreversibility and direction in evolution and order, [[negentropy]], and [[evolution]]."&lt;ref name=arrow-review&gt;{{cite journal | url = http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/0019103569900591?via=ihub | doi = 10.1016/0019-1035(69)90059-1 | title= Book review: Time's arrow and evolution: Third Edition  | journal = Icarus | volume = 11 | issue = 2 | pages = 278–279 | last = Morowitz | first = Harold J. | date = September 1969|bibcode = 1969Icar...11..278M | pmc = 2599115 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Blum argues that evolution followed specific patterns predetermined by the inorganic nature of the earth and its thermodynamic processes.&lt;ref name=yale&gt;{{cite journal | pmc = 2599115 | title= Book reviews: Time's Arrow and Evolution  | journal = [[Yale Journal of Biology and Medicine]] | volume = 24 | issue = 2 | pages = 164 | last = McN. | first = W. P. | date = November 1951}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The cosmological arrow of time ===
{{See also|Entropy|Entropy (arrow of time)}}
The '''cosmological arrow of time''' points in the direction of the universe's expansion.  It may be linked to the thermodynamic arrow, with the universe heading towards a [[Heat death of the Universe|heat death]] ''(Big Chill)'' as the amount of usable energy becomes negligible.  Alternatively, it may be an artifact of our place in the universe's evolution (see the [[Anthropic bias]]), with this arrow reversing as gravity pulls everything back into a [[Big Crunch]].

If this arrow of time is related to the other arrows of time, then the future is ''by definition'' the direction towards which the universe becomes bigger.  Thus, the universe expands — rather than shrinks — by definition.

The thermodynamic arrow of time and the second law of thermodynamics are thought to be a consequence of the [[initial conditions]] in the early universe.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Susskind|first1=Leonard|title=Boltzmann and the Arrow of Time: A Recent Perspective|url=http://www.cornell.edu/video/leonard-susskind-1-boltzmann-and-the-arrow-of-time|website=Cornell University|publisher=Cornell University|accessdate=June 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore they ultimately result from the cosmological set-up.

=== The radiative arrow of time ===
Waves, from [[radio waves]] to [[sound waves]] to those on a pond from throwing a stone, expand outward from their source, even though the [[wave equation]]s accommodate solutions of convergent waves as well as radiative ones. This arrow has been reversed in carefully worked experiments that created convergent waves,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www4.ncsu.edu/~fouque/fink.pdf|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051231022842/http://www4.ncsu.edu/~fouque/fink.pdf |archive-date=31 December 2005 |dead-url=yes |title=Time-Reversed Acoustic |author=[[Mathias Fink]] |date=30 November 1999 |access-date=27 May 2016 }}&lt;/ref&gt; so this arrow probably follows from the thermodynamic arrow in that meeting the conditions to produce a convergent wave requires more order than the conditions for a radiative wave.  Put differently, the probability for initial conditions that produce a convergent wave is much lower than the probability for initial conditions that produce a radiative wave.  In fact, normally a radiative wave increases entropy, while a convergent wave decreases it,{{Citation needed|date=May 2010}}&lt;!-- ref&gt;{{cite book |author1=Nikolai Chernov |author2=Roberto Markarian |year=2006 |title=Chaotic Billiards |publisher=American Mathematical Soc. |page=207 |isbn=9780821840962}}&lt;/ref --&gt; making the latter contradictory to the second law of thermodynamics in usual circumstances.

=== The causal arrow of time ===
A [[causality|cause]] precedes its effect: the causal event occurs before the event it affects.  Birth, for example, follows a successful conception and not vice versa.  Thus causality is intimately bound up with time's arrow.

An [[epistemological]] problem with using causality as an arrow of time is that, as [[David Hume]] maintained, the causal relation per se cannot be perceived; one only perceives sequences of events.  Furthermore, it is surprisingly difficult to provide a clear explanation of what the terms cause and effect really mean, or to define the events to which they refer.  However, it does seem evident that dropping a cup of water is a cause while the cup subsequently shattering and spilling the water is the effect.

Physically speaking, the perception of cause and effect in the dropped cup example is a phenomenon of the [[thermodynamic]] arrow of time, a consequence of the second law of thermodynamics.&lt;ref&gt;''Physical Origins of Time Asymmetry'', chapter 6&lt;/ref&gt;  Controlling the [[future]], or causing something to happen, creates [[Entropy (arrow of time)#Correlations|correlations]] between the doer and the effect,&lt;ref&gt;''Physical Origins of Time Asymmetry'', pp. 109–111.&lt;/ref&gt; and these can only be created as we move forwards in time, not backwards.

=== The particle physics (weak) arrow of time ===
{{Main article|CP violation}}
Certain subatomic interactions involving the [[weak nuclear force]] violate the conservation of both [[Parity (physics)|parity]] and [[charge conjugation]], but only very rarely.  An example is the [[kaon]] [[Particle decay|decay]].&lt;ref&gt;http://physicsweb.org/articles/world/11/12/3&lt;/ref&gt;  According to the [[CPT symmetry|CPT Theorem]], this means they should also be time irreversible, and so establish an arrow of time.  Such processes should be responsible for [[Baryogenesis|matter creation]] in the early universe.

That the combination of parity and charge conjugation is broken so rarely means that this arrow only "barely" points in one direction, setting it apart from the other arrows whose direction is much more obvious.  This arrow had not been linked to any large scale temporal behaviour until the work of [[Joan Vaccaro]], who showed that T violation could be responsible for conservation laws and dynamics.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Vaccaro|first=Joan|date=2016|title=Quantum asymmetry between time and space|journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society A|doi=10.1098/rspa.2015.0670|pmid=26997899|pmc=4786044|volume=472|pages=20150670|arxiv = 1502.04012 |bibcode = 2016RSPSA.47250670V }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The quantum arrow of time ===
{{unsolved|physics|What links the quantum arrow of time to the thermodynamic arrow?}}
According to the [[Copenhagen interpretation]] of [[quantum mechanics]], quantum evolution is governed by the [[Schrödinger equation]], which is time-symmetric, and by [[wave function collapse]], which is time irreversible.  As the mechanism of wave function collapse is [[Interpretations of quantum mechanics|philosophically obscure]], it is not completely clear how this arrow links to the others. Despite the post-measurement state being entirely stochastic in formulations of quantum mechanics, a link to the thermodynamic arrow has been proposed, noting that the second law of thermodynamics amounts to an observation that nature shows a bias for collapsing wave functions into higher entropy states versus lower ones, and the claim that this is merely due to more possible states being high entropy runs afoul of [[Loschmidt's paradox]]. According to one physical view of [[wave function collapse]], the theory of [[quantum decoherence]], the quantum arrow of time is a consequence of the [[Entropy (arrow of time)|thermodynamic arrow of time]].{{citation needed|date=August 2013}}

[[Relational quantum mechanics]] proposes that there is no such thing as an absolute wave function collapse, and that what an observer sees as wave function collapse is in fact the observer becoming entangled with the measured state. The thermodynamic arrow is an increase in entanglement over time; in this way, relational quantum mechanics relates the quantum arrow to the thermodynamic arrow.

=== The quantum source of time ===
Physicists say that [[quantum uncertainty]] gives rise to [[quantum entanglement|entanglement]], the putative source of the arrow of time.{{citation needed|date=September 2018}}  The idea that entanglement might explain the arrow of time was proposed by [[Seth Lloyd]] in the 1980s.  Lloyd argues that quantum uncertainty, and the way it spreads as particles become increasingly entangled, could replace human uncertainty in the old classical proofs as the true source of the arrow of time.  According to Lloyd; “The arrow of time is an arrow of increasing correlations.”&lt;ref&gt;https://www.wired.com/2014/04/quantum-theory-flow-time/&lt;/ref&gt;

=== The psychological/perceptual arrow of time ===
{{Main article|Time perception}}

A related mental arrow arises because one has the sense that one's perception is a continuous movement from the known (past) to the unknown (future).  Anticipating the unknown forms the psychological future, which always seems to be something one is moving towards. However, like a projection in a mirror, it makes what is actually already a part of memory, such as desires, dreams, and hopes, seem ahead of the observer.

The association of "behind ⇔ past" and "ahead ⇔ future" is itself culturally determined.  For example, the [[Aymara language idiosyncrasies|Aymara language]] associates "ahead ⇔ past" and "behind ⇔ future".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.albionmonitor.com/0606a/aymara.html ''For Andes tribe, it's back to the future''] &amp;mdash; accessed 2006-09-26&lt;/ref&gt;  Similarly, the Chinese term for "the day after tomorrow" 後天 ("hòu tiān") literally means "after (or behind) day", whereas "the day before yesterday" 前天 ("qián tiān") is literally "preceding (or in front) day."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.mdbg.net/chindict/chindict.php?page=worddict&amp;wdrst=0&amp;wdqb=day+before+yesterday mbdg.net Chinese-English Dictionary] &amp;mdash; accessed 2017-01-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The words "yesterday" and "tomorrow" both translate to the same word in Hindi:  कल ("kal"),&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Bahri|first=Hardev|title=Learners' Hindi-English Dictionary|year=1989|publisher=Rajpal &amp; Sons|location=Delhi|isbn=81-7028-002-8|page=95}}&lt;/ref&gt; meaning "[one] day remote from today."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Alexiadou|first=Artemis|title=Adverb placement : a case study in antisymmetric syntax|year=1997|publisher=Benjamins|location=Amsterdam [u.a.]|isbn=978-90-272-2739-3|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;  The ambiguity is resolved by verb tense.  परसों ("parsoⁿ") is used for both "day before yesterday" and "day after tomorrow", or "two days from today".&lt;ref&gt;[http://hindi-english.org/index.php?input=%E0%A4%AA%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%82&amp;trans=Translate&amp;direction=AU Hindi-English.org Hindi English Dictionary परसों] &amp;mdash; accessed 2017-01-11&lt;/ref&gt;  नरसों ("narsoⁿ") is used for "three days from today."&lt;ref&gt;[http://shabdkosh.raftaar.in/Meaning-of-%E0%A4%A8%E0%A4%B0%E0%A4%B8%E0%A5%8B%E0%A4%82-in-English Shabdkosk.Raftaar.in Hindi English Dictionary नरसों] &amp;mdash; accessed 2017-01-11&lt;/ref&gt;

The other side of the psychological passage of time is in the realm of volition and action.  We plan and often execute actions intended to affect the course of events in the future.  From the [[Rubaiyat of Omar Khayyam|Rubaiyat]]:

{{buddhism}}
'''Arya''' (Sanskrit, also ''ārya''; Pāli: ''ariya'') is a term frequently used in [[Buddhism]] that can be translated as "noble", "not ordinary", "valuable", "precious",{{refn|group=lower-alpha|Ajahn Sucitto states: "So the four truths (ariya sacca) are generally called “noble” truths, although one might also translate ariya as “precious.” "{{sfn|Ajahn Sucitto|2010|loc=Kindle Location 122}} }} "pure",{{sfn|Mingyur Rinpoche|2007|p=70}} etc. Arya in the sense of "noble" or "exalted" is frequently used in Buddhist texts to designate a spiritual warrior or hero.

==Usage==
The term is used in the following contexts:
* The [[Four Noble Truths]] are called the ''catvāry ārya satyāni'' (Sanskrit) or ''cattāri ariya saccāni'' (Pali). 
* The [[Noble Eightfold Path]] is called the ''ārya mārga'' (Sanskrit, also ''{{IAST|āryāṣṭāṅgikamārga}}'') or ''ariya magga'' (Pāli). 
* Buddha's [[Dharma]] and [[Vinaya]] are the ''ariyassa dhammavinayo''.
* In Buddhist texts, the āryas are those who have the Buddhist ''[[śīla]]'' (Pāli ''sīla'', meaning "virtue") and follow the Buddhist path. 
* Buddhists who have attained one of the [[Four stages of enlightenment|four levels of awakening]] ([[Sotāpanna|stream-entry]], [[Sakadagami|once-returner]], [[Anāgāmi|non-returner]], [[arahant]]) are themselves called ''ariya puggalas'' (Arya persons).

In the context of the [[four noble truths]] (Sanskrit: ''arya satya''; Pali: ''ariya sacca''), contemporary scholars explain the meaning of ''arya'' as follows:
* Paul Williams states: "The Aryas are the noble ones, the saints, those who have attained 'the fruits of the path', 'that middle path the Tathagata has comprehended which promotes sight and knowledge, and which tends to peace, higher wisdom, enlightenment, and Nibbana' (Narada 1980: 50).{{sfn|Williams|2002|p=52}}
* Geshe Tashi Tsering states: "The modifier noble [i.e. arya]  means truth as perceived by arya beings, those beings who have had a direct realization of emptiness or selflessness. Noble means something seen by arya beings as it really is, and in this case it is four recognitions—suffering, origin, cessation, and path. Arya beings see all types of suffering—physical and mental, gross and subtle—exactly as they are, as suffering. For people like us, who do not have the direct realization of emptiness, although we may understand certain levels of physical and mental experiences as suffering, it is impossible for us to see all the levels of suffering for what they are. Instead we may see some things as desirable when in truth they are suffering."{{sfn|Geshe Tashi Tsering|2005|loc=Kindle Locations 349-350}}

Bhikkhu Bodhi explains:&lt;ref group=web&gt;[http://www.vipassana.com/resources/bodhi/nobility_of_the_truths.php The Nobility of the Truths, by Bhikkhu Bodhi]&lt;/ref&gt;
: The word "noble," or ariya, is used by the Buddha to designate a particular type of person, the type of person which it is the aim of his teaching to create. In the discourses the Buddha classifies human beings into two broad categories. On one side there are the puthujjanas, the worldlings, those belonging to the multitude, whose eyes are still covered with the dust of defilements and delusion. On the other side there are the ariyans, the noble ones, the spiritual elite, who obtain this status not from birth, social station or ecclesiastical authority but from their inward nobility of character.

:These two general types are not separated from each other by an impassable chasm, each confined to a tightly sealed compartment. A series of gradations can be discerned rising up from the darkest level of the blind worldling trapped in the dungeon of egotism and self-assertion, through the stage of the virtuous worldling in whom the seeds of wisdom are beginning to sprout, and further through the intermediate stages of noble disciples to the perfected individual at the apex of the entire scale of human development. This is the Arahant, the liberated one, who has absorbed the purifying vision of truth so deeply that all his defilements have been extinguished, and with them, all liability to suffering.

In Chinese Buddhist texts, ''{{IAST|ārya}}'' is translated as [[:wikt:聖|聖]] (approximately, "holy, sacred", [[pinyin]] ''[[:wikt:shèng|shèng]]'', [[on'yomi]] ''[[:wikt:せい|sei]]'').

The spiritual character of the use of the term ārya in Buddhist texts can also be seen in the Mahavibhasa and in the Yogacarabhumi. The [[Mahavibhasa|Mahāvibhasa]] &lt;ref&gt;(Taisho 1545, vol. xxvii, 401c29-402a12, 402b5-6, and 402a27-b6)&lt;/ref&gt; states that only the noble ones (āryas) realize all four of the four noble truths (āryasatyāni) and that only a noble wisdom understands them fully. The same text also describes the āryas as the ones who "have understood and realized about the [truth of] [[dukkha|suffering]], ([[impermanence]], [[sunyata|emptiness]], and [[anatta|no-self]])" and who "understand things as they are".&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst 1999"&gt;(Deshpande/ Gomez in Bronkhorst &amp; Deshpande 1999)&lt;/ref&gt; In another text, the [[Yogacarabhumi|Yogācārabhūmi]] (Taishō 1579, vol. xx, 364b10-15), the āryas are described as being free from the ''viparyāsa''s.

Several Buddhist texts show that the ''{{IAST|ārya dharma}}'' was taught to everybody, including the āryas, [[Dasyu]]s, [[deva (Hinduism)|Devas]], [[Gandharva]]s and [[Asura]]s. The {{IAST|Bhaiṣajyavastu}} (from the [[Mulasarvastivada|Mūlasarvāstivādavinaya]]) describes a story of Buddha teaching his dharma to the [[Four Heavenly Kings]] ({{IAST|Catvāraḥ Mahārājāḥ}}) of the four directions. In this story, the guardians of the east ({{IAST|Dhṛtarāṣṭra}}) and the south ({{IAST|Virūḍhaka}}) are āryajatiya (āryas) who speak [[Sanskrit]], while the guardians of the west ({{IAST|Virūpākṣa}}) and the north ([[Vaisravana|{{IAST|Vaiśravaṇa}}]]) are dasyujatiya (Dasyus) who speak Dasyu languages. In order to teach his Dharma, Buddha has to deliver his discourse in Aryan and Dasyu languages. This story describes Buddha teaching his Dharma to the āryas and Dasyus alike.&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst &amp; Deshpande 1999"&gt;Bronkhorst &amp; Deshpande 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Karandavyuha|{{IAST|Karaṇḍavyūha}}]] (a [[Mahayana|Mahāyāna]] sūtra) describes how [[Avalokitesvara|Avalokiteśvara]] taught the ārya Dharma to the [[asura]]s, [[Yaksha|{{IAST|yakṣa}}]]s and [[Rakshasa|{{IAST|rakṣasa}}]]s.&lt;ref name="Bronkhorst &amp; Deshpande 1999"/&gt;

In many parts of the South India, if somebody (new) is supposed to be addressed respectably, the prefix "Ayya", derived from "Arya" is used. South Indians used to call them "Arya" which is now transformed to "Ayya". This term is used even today.{{citation needed|date=March 2015}}

{{Political anthropology|expanded=Basic concepts}}

'''Caste''' is a form of [[social stratification]] characterized by [[endogamy]], hereditary transmission of a lifestyle which often includes an occupation, status in a hierarchy, customary social interaction, and exclusion.{{Sfn|Scott|Marshall|2005|p=66}}{{Sfn|Winthrop|1991|pp=27–30}} It is an extreme evolution of a system of legally-entrenched social classes, also endogamous and hereditary, such as that of feudal Europe.  Although caste systems exist in various regions, its paradigmatic ethnographic example is the division of Indian society into rigid social groups, with roots in India's ancient history and persisting until today;{{Sfn|Béteille|2002|p=66}} it is sometimes used as an analogical basis for the study of caste-like social divisions existing outside India.  In biology, the term is applied to role stratification in [[eusocial]] animals like ants and termites, though the analogy is imperfect as these also involve extremely stratified [[queen ant|reproduction]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |last= Wilson |first= E. O. |year= 1979 |title= The Evolution of Caste Systems in Social Insects |journal= Proceedings of the American Philosophical Society |volume= 123 |number=4 |pages= 204–210 |jstor= 986579}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The origins of the term 'caste' are attributed to the Spanish and Portuguese ''[[casta]]'', which, according to the [[John Minsheu]]'s Spanish dictionary (1599), means "race, lineage, or breed".&lt;ref name=oed-caste&gt;{{Cite OED|caste|id=28546}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the Spanish colonized the [[New World]], they used the word to mean a "clan or lineage". It was, however, the Portuguese who first employed ''casta'' in the primary modern sense of the English word ‘caste’ when they applied it to the thousands of endogamous, hereditary Indian social groups they encountered upon their arrival in India in 1498&lt;ref name=oed-caste/&gt;&lt;ref name=pitt-rivers&gt;{{citation|last=Pitt-Rivers|first=Julian|editor=T O Beidelman|title=The translation of culture essays to E.E.

The use of the spelling "caste", with this latter meaning, is first attested in English in 1613.&lt;ref name=oed-caste/&gt;

{{Main|Caste system in India}}
{{commons category|Castes in India}}
Modern India's caste system is based on the social groupings called ''[[jāti]]'' and the  theoretical ''[[varna (Hinduism)|varna]]''. The system of ''varnas'' appears in Hindu texts dating back to 1000 BCE and envisages the society divided into four classes: [[Brahmins]] (scholars and priests), [[Kshatriya]]s (warriors and nobles), [[Vaishyas]] (farmers, merchants, and artisans) and [[Shudras]] (laborers/service providers). The texts do not mention any separate, untouchable category in ''[[varna (Hinduism)|varna]]'' classification. Scholars believe that the system of ''varnas'' was a theoretical classification envisioned by the Brahmins, but never truly operational in society. The practical division of the society had always been in terms of ''jātis'' (birth groups), which are not based on any specific principle, but could vary from ethnic origins to occupations. The ''jātis'' have been endogamous groups without any fixed hierarchy but subject to vague notions of rank articulated over time based on lifestyle and social, political or economic status. In many instances, as in Bengal, historically the kings and rulers had been called upon, when required, to mediate on the ranks of ''jātis'', which might number in thousands all over the subcontinent and vary by region. In practice, the ''jātis'' may or may not fit into the ''varna'' classes and many prominent ''jatis'', for example the Jats and Yadavs, straddled two varnas i.e. Kshatriyas and Vaishyas, and the ''varna'' status of ''jātis'' itself was subject to articulation over time.

Starting with the British colonial Census of 1901 led by [[Herbert Hope Risley]], all the ''jātis'' were grouped under the theoretical ''varnas'' categories.&lt;ref name=dirks&gt;{{cite book|url=http://press.princeton.edu/titles/7191.html|author=Nicholas B. Dirks|title=Castes of Mind: Colonialism and the Making of New India|year=2001|isbn=978-0-691-08895-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to political scientist [[Lloyd Rudolph]], Risley believed that ''varna'', however ancient, could be applied to all the modern castes found in India, and "[he] meant to identify and place several hundred million Indians within it."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3vnsnma5nW4C |title=The Modernity of Tradition: Political Development in India |first=Lloyd I. |last=Rudolph |authorlink=Lloyd I. Rudolph |others=[[Susanne Hoeber Rudolph|Rudolph, Susanne Hoeber]] |year=1984 |publisher=University of Chicago Press |pages=116–117 |isbn=0-226-73137-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The terms ''varna'' (conceptual classification based on occupation) and ''jāti'' (groups) are two distinct concepts: while ''varna'' is the idealised four-part division envisaged by the [[Dvija|Twice-Borns]], ''jāti'' (community) refers to the thousands of actual endogamous groups prevalent across the subcontinent. The classical authors scarcely speak of anything other than the ''varnas'', as it provided a convenient shorthand; but a problem arises when even Indologists sometimes confuse the two.&lt;ref name="Chicago"&gt;{{citation |author=Dumont, Louis |title=Homo hierarchicus: the caste system and its implications |publisher=University of Chicago Press |location=Chicago |year=1980 |pages=66–67 |isbn=0-226-16963-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Upon independence from Britain, the Indian Constitution listed 1,108 castes across the country as Scheduled Castes in 1950, for positive discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://lawmin.nic.in/ld/subord/rule3a.htm |title=The Constitution (Scheduled Castes) Order 1950 |publisher=Lawmin.nic.in |date= |access-date=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Untouchable communities are sometimes called ''[[Scheduled Castes]]'', ''[[Dalit]]'' or ''[[Harijan]]'' in contemporary literature.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Scaling Caste Walls With Capitalism’s Ladders in India|publisher=The New York Times|author=Lydia Polgreen|date=21 December 2011|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2011/12/22/world/asia/indias-boom-creates-openings-for-untouchables.html?pagewanted=all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, Dalits were 16.2% of India's population.&lt;ref name=censtat01&gt;{{cite web|title=Scheduled castes and scheduled tribes population: Census 2001|year=2004|publisher=Government of India|url=http://censusindia.gov.in/Census_Data_2001/India_at_glance/scst.aspx}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the 15 million bonded child workers are from the lowest castes.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.unicef.org/pon95/chil0016.html Children pay high price for cheap labour]".

The socio-economic limitations of the caste system are reduced due to urbanization and [[affirmative action]]. Nevertheless, the caste system still exists in [[endogamy]] and [[Family patrimony|patrimony]], and thrives in the politics of democracy, where caste provides ready made constituencies to politicians. The globalization and economic opportunities from foreign businesses has influenced the growth of India's middle-class population. Some members of the Chhattisgarh Potter Caste Community (CPCC) are middle-class urban professionals and no longer potters unlike the remaining majority of traditional rural potter members. The co-existence of the middle-class and traditional members in the CPCC has created [[intersectionality]] between caste and class.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Natrajan|first1=Balmurli|title=Caste, class, and community in india: An ethnographic approach|journal=Ethnology|date=2005|volume=4|issue=3|pages=227–241}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is persistence of caste in Indian politics. Caste associations have evolved into caste-based political parties. Political parties and the state perceive caste as an important factor for mobilization of people and policy development.

Studies by Bhatt and Beteille have shown changes in status, openness, mobility in the social aspects of Indian society. As a result of the modern social pressures on the country, India is experiencing a change in their social sphere dynamic as well as economically in the caste system. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Gandhi|first1=Rag S.|title=FROM CASTE TO CLASS IN INDIAN SOCIETY|journal=Humboldt Journal of Social Relations|date=1980|volume=7|issue=2|pages=1-14|}} &lt;/ref&gt; While arranged marriages are still the most common practice in India, the internet has helped the younger generation of Indians to have more control over their marriages through the use of dating apps. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine|last1=Gandhi|first1=Divya.|title= Running in the family|magazine=The Hindu|date=April 2, 2016}} &lt;/ref&gt; Hypergamy is still a common practice in India and Hindu culture. Men can marry a lower caste or a woman of an equal one. If the girl marries up, then her children will take the status of their father. If the girl marries down, her entire family is reduced to the social status of their son in law. Geographical factors also determine the loosening of the caste system. Many Northern villages are more likely to experience exogamous marriages, due to a lack of people within the same caste. Women in North India have been found to be less likely to leave or divorce their husbands since they are of a relatively lower caste system, and have higher restrictions on their freedoms. On the other hand, Pahari women have much more freedom to leave their husbands without stigma.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1= Berreman|first1=Gerald D.|title=Village Exogamy in Northernmost India|date=1962|volume=18|issue=1|pages=55-58|}} &lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Caste system in Nepal}}
The [[Nepal]]ese caste system resembles that of the Indian ''jāti'' system with numerous ''jāti'' divisions with a ''varna'' system superimposed for a rough equivalence. But since the culture and the society is different some of the things are different. Inscriptions attest the beginnings of a caste system during the [[Licchavi (kingdom)|Licchavi]] period.  Jayasthiti Malla (1382–1395) categorized Newars into 64 castes (Gellner 2001). A similar exercise was made during the reign of Mahindra Malla (1506–1575). The Hindu social code was later set up in Gorkha by Ram Shah (1603–1636).

[[Bali]]nese caste structure has been described in early 20th-century European literature to be based on three categories – triwangsa (thrice born) or the nobility, ''dwijāti'' (twice born) in contrast to ''ekajāti'' (once born) the low folks. Four statuses were identified in these sociological studies, spelled a bit differently from the caste categories for India:&lt;ref name=boon&gt;{{cite book|title=The Anthropological Romance of Bali 1597-1972: Dynamic Perspectives in Marriage and Caste, Politics and Religion|author=James Boon|year=1977|isbn=0-521-21398-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Brahmin]]as – [[priest]]
*Satrias – [[knight]]hood
*Wesias – commerce
*Sudras – servitude

The Brahmana caste was further subdivided by these Dutch ethnographers into two: Siwa and Buda. The Siwa caste was subdivided into five: Kemenuh, Keniten, Mas, Manuba and Petapan. This classification was to accommodate the observed marriage between higher-caste Brahmana men with lower-caste women. The other castes were similarly further sub-classified by these 19th-century and early-20th-century ethnographers based on numerous criteria ranging from profession, endogamy or exogamy or polygamy, and a host of other factors in a manner similar to ''castas'' in Spanish colonies such as Mexico, and caste system studies in British colonies such as India.&lt;ref name=boon/&gt;

===Japan===
{{Main|Edo society}}
[[File:Samurai and servant.jpg|thumb|Japanese [[samurai]] of importance and servant.]]

In Japan's history, social strata based on inherited position rather than personal merit, were rigid and highly formalized in a system called ''mibunsei'' (身分制). At the top were the Emperor and Court nobles ([[kuge]]), together with the Shōgun and daimyō. Below them, the population was divided into [[Four occupations|four classes]]: [[samurai]], peasants, craftsmen and merchants. Only samurai were allowed to bear arms. A samurai had a right to kill any peasants, craftsman or merchant who he felt were disrespectful. Merchants were the lowest caste because they did not produce any products. The castes were further sub-divided; for example, peasants were labelled as ''furiuri'', ''tanagari'', ''mizunomi-byakusho'' among others. As in Europe, the castes and sub-classes were of the same race, religion and culture.

Howell, in his review of [[Japan]]ese society notes that if a Western power had colonized Japan in the 19th century, they would have discovered and imposed a rigid four-caste hierarchy in Japan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Geographies of identity in nineteenth-century Japan|author=David L. Howell|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=0-520-24085-5|year=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

De Vos and Wagatsuma observe that Japanese society had a systematic and extensive caste system. They discuss how alleged caste impurity and alleged racial inferiority, concepts often  assumed to be different, are superficial terms, and are due to identical inner psychological processes, which expressed themselves in Japan and elsewhere.&lt;ref name=gdvhw&gt;{{cite book|title=Japan's invisible race: caste in culture and personality|author=George De Vos and Hiroshi Wagatsuma|publisher=University of California Press|year=1966|isbn=978-0-520-00306-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Endogamy was common because marriage across caste lines was socially unacceptable.&lt;ref name=gdvhw/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Japanese Fashion: A Cultural History|author=Toby Slade|publisher=Berg|isbn=978-1-84788-252-3|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Japan]] had its own untouchable caste, shunned and ostracized, historically referred to by the insulting term ''Eta'', now called ''[[Burakumin]]''. While modern law has officially abolished the class hierarchy, there are reports of discrimination against the [[Buraku]] or [[Burakumin]] underclasses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrdc.net/sahrdc/hrfeatures/HRF39.htm |title=Class, Ethnicity and Nationality: Japan Finds Plenty of Space for Discrimination |publisher=Hrdc.net |date=2001-06-18 |accessdate=2013-11-30}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Burakumin are regarded as "ostracised".&lt;ref&gt;

===Korea===
{{Korean caste system}}
[[File:Korea-History-Goban Game in Seoul Korea 1904 (LOC).jpg|thumbnail|A typical Yangban family scene from 1904.  The Yoon family had an enduring presence in Korean politics from the 1800s until the 1970s.]]

The [[baekjeong]] (백정) were an "untouchable" outcaste of Korea. The meaning today is that of butcher. It originates in the [[Goryeo-Khitan Wars|Khitan invasion of Korea]] in the 11th century. The defeated [[Khitans]] who surrendered were settled in isolated communities throughout Goryeo to forestall rebellion.  They were valued for their skills in hunting, herding, butchering, and making of leather, common skill sets among nomads.  Over time, their ethnic origin was forgotten, and they formed the bottom layer of Korean society.

In 1392, with the foundation of the Confucian [[Joseon dynasty]], Korea systemised its own native class system. At the top were the two official classes, the [[Yangban]], which literally means "two classes". It was composed of scholars (''munban'') and warriors (''muban''). Scholars had a significant social advantage over the warriors. Below were the ''jung-in'' (중인-中人: literally "middle people". This was a small class of specialized professions such as medicine, accounting, translators, regional bureaucrats, etc. Below that were the ''sangmin'' (상민-常民: literally 'commoner'), farmers working their own fields. Korea also had a [[serf]] population known as the ''nobi''. The nobi population could fluctuate up to about one third of the population, but on average the nobi made up about 10% of the total population.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Rodriguez|first1=Junius P.|title=The Historical Encyclopedia of World Slavery|publisher=ABC-CLIO|isbn=9780874368857|page=392|url=https://books.google.com/?id=ATq5_6h2AT0C&amp;pg=RA1-PA392&amp;dq=%2210+percent+of+the+total+population+on+average,+but+it+could+rise+up+to+one-third+of+the+total%22#v=onepage&amp;q=%2210%20percent%20of%20the%20total%20population%20on%20average%2C%20but%20it%20could%20rise%20up%20to%20one-third%20of%20the%20total%22&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 February 2017|language=en|year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1801, the vast majority of government nobi were emancipated,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Kim|first1=Youngmin|last2=Pettid|first2=Michael J.|title=Women and Confucianism in Choson Korea: New Perspectives|publisher=SUNY Press|isbn=9781438437774|page=141|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UwgUa6WWFBMC&amp;pg=PA141#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 February 2017|language=en|date=2011-11-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and by 1858 the nobi population stood at about 1.5% of the total population of Korea.&lt;ref name="nobi"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Campbell|first1=Gwyn|title=Structure of Slavery in Indian Ocean Africa and Asia|publisher=Routledge|isbn=9781135759179|page=163|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=J0iRAgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA163#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|accessdate=14 February 2017|language=en|date=2004-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt; The hereditary nobi system was officially abolished around 1886–87 and the rest of the nobi system was abolished with the [[Gabo Reform]] of 1894,&lt;ref name="nobi" /&gt; but traces remained until 1930.

The opening of Korea to foreign Christian missionary activity in the late 19th century saw some improvement in the status of the ''baekjeong''. However, everyone was not equal under the Christian congregation, and even so protests erupted when missionaries tried to integrate ''baekjeong'' into worship, with non-''baekjeong'' finding this attempt insensitive to traditional notions of hierarchical advantage.{{Citation needed|date=September 2007}} Around the same time, the ''baekjeong'' began to resist open social discrimination.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|chapter=In Search of Human Rights: The Paekchŏng Movement in Colonial Korea|title=Colonial Modernity in Korea|first=Joong-Seop|last=Kim|editor=Gi-Wook Shin and Michael Robinson|year=1999|pages=326|isbn=0-674-00594-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; They focused on social and economic injustices affecting them, hoping to create an [[egalitarianism|egalitarian]] Korean society. Their efforts included attacking social discrimination by upper class, authorities, and "commoners", and the use of degrading language against children in public schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Korean Paekjŏng under Japanese rule: the quest for equality and human rights|first=Joong-Seop|last=Kim|year=2003|pages=147}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the [[Gabo reform]] of 1896, the class system of Korea was officially abolished. Following the collapse of the [[Enlightenment Party|Gabo government]], the new cabinet, which became the Gwangmu government after the establishment of the Korean Empire, introduced systematic measures for abolishing the traditional class system. One measure was the new household registration system, reflecting the goals of formal [[social equality]], which was implemented by the loyalists' cabinet. Whereas the old registration system signified household members according to their hierarchical social status, the new system called for an occupation.&lt;ref name="proper"&gt;Hwang, Kyung Moon (2004), University of Southern California. ''Citizenship, Social Equality and Government Reform: Changes in the Household Registration System in Korea, 1894–1910''&lt;/ref&gt;

While most Koreans by then had surnames and even [[bongwan]], although still substantial number of [[cheonmin]], mostly consisted of [[serfs]] and slaves, and [[Untouchability|untouchables]] did not. According to the new system, they were then required to fill in the blanks for surname in order to be registered as constituting separate households. Instead of creating their own family name, some cheonmins appropriated their masters' surname, while others simply took the most common surname and its bongwan in the local area. Along with this example, activists within and outside the Korean government had based their visions of a new relationship between the government and people through the concept of citizenship, employing the term ''inmin'' ("people") and later, ''kungmin'' ("citizen").&lt;ref name="proper"/&gt;

Among the Igbo of [[Nigeria]] – especially [[Enugu State|Enugu]], [[Anambra State|Anambra]], [[Imo State|Imo]], [[Abia State|Abia]], [[Ebonyi State|Ebonyi]], [[Edo State|Edo]] and [[Delta state|Delta]] states of the country – Obinna finds Osu caste system has been and continues to be a major social issue. The Osu caste is determined by one's birth into a particular family irrespective of the religion practised by the individual. Once born into Osu caste, this Nigerian person is an outcast, shunned and ostracized, with limited opportunities or acceptance, regardless of his or her ability or merit. Obinna discusses how this caste system-related identity and power is deployed within government, Church and indigenous communities.&lt;ref name=Obinna1/&gt;

The ''osu'' class systems of eastern [[Nigeria]] and southern [[Cameroon]] are derived from indigenous religious beliefs and discriminate against the "Osus" people as "owned by deities" and outcasts.

The Songhai economy was based on a caste system. The most common were metalworkers, fishermen, and carpenters. Lower caste participants consisted of mostly non-farm working immigrants, who at times were provided special privileges and held high positions in society. At the top were noblemen and direct descendants of the original Songhai people, followed by freemen and traders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.africankingdoms.com|title=AFRICAN KINGDOMS - Kingdoms of Ancient African History|website=www.africankingdoms.com|accessdate=22 October 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a review of social stratification systems in Africa, Richter reports that the term caste has been used by French and American scholars to many groups of West African artisans. These groups have been described as inferior, deprived of all political power, have a specific occupation, are hereditary and sometimes despised by others. Richter illustrates caste system in [[Ivory Coast]], with six sub-caste categories. Unlike other parts of the world, mobility is sometimes possible within sub-castes, but not across caste lines. Farmers and artisans have been, claims Richter, distinct castes. Certain sub-castes are shunned more than others. For example, exogamy is rare for women born into families of woodcarvers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Further considerations of caste in West Africa: The Senufo|author=Dolores Richter|journal=Africa|date= January 1980|volume=50|pages=37–54|doi=10.2307/1158641|jstor=1158641}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Similarly, the [[Mandé peoples|Mandé]] societies in [[Gambia]], [[Ghana]], [[Guinea]], [[Ivory Coast]], [[Liberia]], [[Senegal]] and [[Sierra Leone]] have social stratification systems that divide society by ethnic ties. The Mande class system regards the ''jonow'' slaves as inferior. Similarly, the [[Wolof people|Wolof]] in Senegal is divided into three main groups, the ''geer'' (freeborn/nobles), ''jaam'' (slaves and slave descendants) and the underclass ''neeno''. In various parts of West Africa, [[Fula people|Fulani]] societies also have class divisions. Other castes include ''Griots'', ''Forgerons'', and ''Cordonniers''.

Tamari has described endogamous castes of over fifteen West African peoples, including the Tukulor, Songhay, Dogon, Senufo, Minianka, Moors, Manding, Soninke, Wolof, Serer, Fulani, and Tuareg. Castes appeared among the ''Malinke'' people no later than 14th century, and was present among the ''Wolof'' and ''Soninke'', as well as some ''Songhay'' and ''Fulani'' populations, no later than 16th century. Tamari claims that wars, such as the ''Sosso-Malinke'' war described in the ''Sunjata'' epic, led to the formation of blacksmith and bard castes among the people that ultimately became the Mali empire.

As West Africa evolved over time, sub-castes emerged that acquired secondary specializations or changed occupations. Endogamy was prevalent within a caste or among a limited number of castes, yet castes did not form demographic isolates according to Tamari. Social status according to caste was inherited by off-springs automatically; but this inheritance was paternal. That is, children of higher caste men and lower caste or slave concubines would have the caste status of the father.&lt;ref name=tamari1&gt;{{cite journal|journal=The Journal of African History|year=1991|volume=32|issue=2|pages=221–250|doi=10.1017/S0021853700025718|title=The Development of Caste Systems in West Africa|author=Tal Tamari}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Central Africa===
Ethel M. Albert in 1960 claimed that the societies in [[Central Africa]] were caste-like social stratification systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Socio-Political Organization and Receptivity to Change: Some Differences between Ruanda and Urundi|author=Ethel M. Albert|journal=Southwestern Journal of Anthropology|volume=16|number= 1|date= Spring 1960|pages=46–74}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, in 1961, Maquet notes that the society in [[Rwanda]] and [[Burundi]] can be best described as castes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Premise of Inequality in Ruanda: A Study of Political Relations in a Central African Kingdom|author= Jacques J. Maquet|year=1962|pages=135–171|publisher=Oxford University Press, London|isbn=978-0-19-823168-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tutsi]], noted Maquet, considered themselves as superior, with the more numerous [[Hutu]] and the least numerous [[Twa]] regarded, by birth, as respectively, second and third in the hierarchy of Rwandese society. These groups were largely endogamous, exclusionary and with limited mobility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Power in Ruanda|author=Helen Codere|journal=Anthropologica|volume=4|number=1|year=1962|pages=45–85|jstor=25604523}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Horn of Africa===
[[File:NSRW Africa Midgan.png|thumb|upright|The [[Madhiban]] (Midgan) specialize in leather occupation. Along with the Tumal and Yibir, they are collectively known as ''sab''.&lt;ref name="Lewis"/&gt;]]
In a review published in 1977, Todd reports that numerous scholars report a system of social stratification in different parts of Africa that resembles some or all aspects of caste system. Examples of such caste systems, he claims, are to be found in Ethiopia in communities such as the [[Gurage people|Gurage]] and [[Konso people|Konso]]. He then presents the Dime of Southwestern Ethiopia, amongst whom there operates a system which Todd claims can be unequivocally labelled as caste system. The Dime have seven castes whose size varies considerably. Each broad caste level is a hierarchical order that is based on notions of purity, non-purity and impurity. It uses the concepts of defilement to limit contacts between caste categories and to preserve the purity of the upper castes. These caste categories have been exclusionary, endogamous and the social identity inherited.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=LA CASTE EN AFRIQUE? (Caste in Africa?)|author=D. M. Todd|journal=Africa|date=October 1977|volume=47 |issue=4|pages= 398–412|url=http://journals.cambridge.org/action/displayAbstract?fromPage=online&amp;aid=7903506|doi=10.2307/1158345|jstor=1158345}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Alula Pankhurst]] has published a study of caste groups in SW Ethiopia.&lt;ref&gt;Pankhurst, Alula. 1999. {{"'}}Caste' in Africa: the evidence from south-western Ethiopia reconsidered". ''Africa'' 69(4), pp. 485–509.&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Kingdom of Kafa|Kafa]], there were also traditionally groups labeled as castes. "Based on research done before the Derg regime, these studies generally presume the existence of a social hierarchy similar to the caste system. At the top of this hierarchy were the Kafa, followed by occupational groups including blacksmiths (Qemmo), weavers (Shammano), bards (Shatto), potters, and tanners (Manno). In this hierarchy, the Manjo were commonly referred to as hunters, given the lowest status equal only to slaves."&lt;ref&gt;p. 299. Sayuri Yoshida. "Why did the Manjo convert to Protestant?

Aspen, Birhanu Teferra and Shiferaw Bekele, Trondheim 2009. pp. 299–309.&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Borana Oromo]] of southern [[Ethiopia]] in the [[Horn of Africa]] also have a class system, wherein the Wata, an acculturated hunter-gatherer group, represent the lowest class. Though the Wata today speak the [[Oromo language]], they have traditions of having previously spoken another language before adopting Oromo.&lt;ref name="Westermann"&gt;{{cite book|last=Diedrich Westermann|first=Edwin William Smith, Cyril Daryll Forde|title=Africa|year=1981|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=853}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The traditionally nomadic [[Somali people]] are divided into clans, wherein the [[Rahanweyn]] agro-pastoral clans and the occupational clans such as the [[Madhiban]] were traditionally sometimes treated as outcasts.&lt;ref&gt;I.

==Europe==

===Basque country===
For centuries, through the modern times, the majority regarded [[Cagot]]s who lived primarily in the Basque region of France and Spain as an inferior caste, the untouchables. While they had the same skin color and religion as the majority, in the churches they had to use segregated doors, drink from segregated fonts, and receive communion on the end of long wooden spoons. It was a closed social system. The socially isolated Cagots were endogamous, and chances of social mobility non-existent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=The last untouchable in Europe|author=Sean Thomas|date=28 July 2008|publisher=The Independent, United Kingdom|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/the-last-untouchable-in-europe-878705.html|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Hansson1996"&gt;{{cite book|author=Anders Hansson|title=Chinese Outcasts: Discrimination and Emancipation in Late Imperial China|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=4Ibp1RTW0AoC&amp;pg=PA15|year=1996|publisher=BRILL|isbn=978-90-04-10596-6|pages=15–16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===United Kingdom===
In July 2013, the UK government announced its intention to amend the [[Equality Act 2010]] to "introduce legislation on caste, including any necessary exceptions to the caste provisions, within the framework of domestic discrimination law".&lt;ref&gt;Government Equalities Office, [https://www.gov.uk/government/uploads/system/uploads/attachment_data/file/225658/130726-Caste-Discrimination.pdf Caste legislation introduction – programme and timetable], accessed 2 June 2016&lt;/ref&gt; Section 9(5) of the Equality Act 2010 provides that "a [[Minister (government)|Minister]] may by [[Statutory order|order]] amend the statutory definition of race to include caste and may provide for exceptions in the Act to apply or not to apply to caste".

From September 2013 to February 2014, [[Meena Dhanda]] led a project on "Caste in Britain" for the UK [[Equality and Human Rights Commission]] (EHRC).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.equalityhumanrights.com/en/publication-download/research-report-91-caste-britain-socio-legal-review|title=Research report 91: Caste in Britain: Socio-legal Review {{!}} Equality and Human Rights Commission|website=www.equalityhumanrights.com|access-date=2017-10-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==United States==
In view of [[W. Lloyd Warner]] relationship between Blacks and Whites in USA historically showed many features of caste like residential segregation, marriage restrictions. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.journals.uchicago.edu/doi/abs/10.1086/217391&lt;/ref&gt; Discrimination based upon socio-economic factors are historically prevalent within the country. 

According to Gerald D. Berreman, in the two systems, there are rigid rules of avoidance and certain types of contacts are defined as contaminating. In India, there are complex religious features which make up the system, whereas in the United States race and color are the basis of differentiation. The caste system in India and in the United States has higher groups which desire to retain their position for themselves and thus perpetuate the system.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Berreman|first=Gerald|date=September 1960|title=Caste in India and the United States|url=https://www.jstor.org/stable/2773155?seq=1#metadata_info_tab_contents|journal=American Journal of Sociology|volume=66|pages=120-127|via=JSTOR}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the increased immigration to the United States, many Indian Americans have created a similar system. A survey commissioned by Equality Labs finds that caste discrimination is playing out in the United States as well. 2/3 of the members of the lowest caste, called Dalits, said that they have faced workplace discrimination due to their caste. 41% have experienced discrimination in education because of it in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;Subramanian Shankar Feed Subramanian Shankar, and University of Hawaii.“Does America Have a Caste System?” CityLab, The Atlantic Monthly Group, 26 Jan. 2018, www.citylab.com/equity/2018/01/does-america-have-a-caste-system/551591/.&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''chauffeur''', ([[French language|French]], "heater upper") was a type of French criminal active from the 18th to the 20th centuries. In gangs, they carried out [[Home invasion]]s on remote, rural dwellings, then tortured the householders into revealing the hiding places of savings or valuables. This was often done by burning victims' feet in the fireplace, which gave rise to the name for them.

A notable gang was the [[Chauffeurs de la Drome]] who were responsible for eighteen murders between 1905 and 1908.&lt;ref name="Anderson2011"&gt;{{cite book|author=Malcolm Anderson|title=In Thrall to Political Change: Police and Gendarmerie in France|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CYqKByxmueEC&amp;pg=PA53|date=25 August 2011|publisher=OUP Oxford|isbn=978-0-19-969364-1|pages=53}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Constant conjunction''' is a phrase used in philosophy as a variant or near synonym for [[causality]] and [[inductive reasoning|induction]]. It can be construed to contradict a more common phrase: [[correlation is not causation]]. 

==Overview==
The philosopher [[David Hume]] used the phrase frequently in his discussion of the limits of [[empiricism]] to explain our ideas of causation and [[inference]]. In ''[[An Enquiry concerning Human Understanding]]'' and ''[[A Treatise of Human Nature]]'' Hume proposed that the origin of our knowledge of necessary connections arises out of observation of the ''constant conjunction'' of certain impressions across many instances. A more modern conception would argue that [[scientific law]] is distinguishable from a principle that arises merely accidentally because of the constant conjunction of one thing and another, but there is considerable controversy over what this distinguishing feature might be.

Although [[British empiricism]] and [[associationist]] philosophers elaborated on Hume's fundamental idea in many diverse ways, and metaphysicians like [[Immanuel Kant]] tried to dissipate the position,{{verification needed|date=October 2014}} the force of his arguments has remained remarkably robust, and they have found unexpected support in three scientific discoveries of the 20th century: [[Ivan Pavlov]]'s laws of conditioning; [[Donald O. Hebb|Hebbian]] [[biological neural network|neural network]]s; and spike-timing-dependent plasticity ([[STDP]]).

In Pavlov's framework, an [[unconditioned stimulus]] can follow in constant conjunction a conditioning/conditioned stimulus within a timeframe of milliseconds to several seconds, and result in the [[conditioned stimulus]] having many of the properties of the unconditioned stimulus. [[Donald O. Hebb|Donald Hebb]] explained this as an intrinsic property of [[cell assemblies]] within the nervous system to form connections within large cliques of cells whenever those cells fire together within a reasonably short period of time. (A modern shorthand for his ideas states: "Cells that fire together, wire together".) Modern [[neuroscience]] has confirmed this insight as a product of the activity of synapses and STDP, so structured to strengthen connections between cells that fire within very short periods (10s of milliseconds) of each other. The longer time periods of classical conditioning are presumably a large-number effect of cliques of these synapses and cells.

In [[engineering]], a '''corner case''' (or '''pathological case''') involves a problem or situation that occurs only outside of normal operating [[parameter]]s—specifically one that manifests itself when multiple environmental variables or conditions are simultaneously at extreme levels, even though each parameter is within the specified range for that parameter.

For example, a loudspeaker might distort audio, but only when played at maximum volume, maximum [[Bass (sound)|bass]], and in a [[Humidity|high-humidity]] environment. Or a [[Server (computing)|computer server]] may be unreliable, but only with the maximum complement of 64 [[Microprocessor|processors]], 512 [[Gigabyte|GB]] of [[Computer memory|memory]], and 10,000 signed-on [[User (computing)|users]].

Contrast a corner case with an [[edge case]], the latter an issue that occurs only at a (single) maximum or minimum parameter. For example, a speaker may distort audio at maximum volume, even in the absence of other extreme settings or conditions.

Corner cases form part of an [[engineer]]'s lexicon—especially an engineer involved in testing or [[debugging]] a complex system. Corner cases are often harder and more expensive to reproduce, test, and optimize because they require maximal configurations in multiple dimensions. They are frequently less-tested, given the belief that few product users will, in practice, exercise the product at multiple simultaneous maximum settings. Expert users of systems therefore routinely find corner case anomalies, and in many of these, errors.

The term "corner case" comes about by physical analogy with "edge case" as an extension of the "[[flight envelope]]" metaphor to a set of testing conditions whose boundaries are determined by the 2&lt;sup&gt;n&lt;/sup&gt; combinations of extreme (minimum and maximum) values for the number ''n'' of variables being tested, ''i.e.'', the total [[parameter space]] for those variables. Where an edge case involves pushing one variable to a minimum or maximum, putting users at the "edge" of the [[Configuration space (physics)|configuration space]], a corner case involves doing so with multiple variables, which would put users at a "corner" of a multidimensional configuration space.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://softwareengineering.stackexchange.com/questions/125587/what-are-the-difference-between-an-edge-case-a-corner-case-a-base-case-and-a-b|title=What are the difference between an edge case, a corner case, a base case and a boundary case?|website=Software Engineering Stack Exchange|accessdate=December 5, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5029">'''Counterconditioning''' (also called '''stimulus substitution''') is [[Functional analysis (psychology)|functional analytic]] principle that is part of [[experimental analysis of behavior|behavior analysis]], and involves the conditioning of an unwanted behavior or response to a [[Stimulus (psychology)|stimulus]] into a wanted behavior or response by the association of positive actions with the stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gerrig, Richard J.|author2=Philip G. Zimbardo|lastauthoramp=y|title=Psychology And Life|publisher=Pearson Education|year=2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, when training a [[dog]], a person would create a positive response by petting or calming the dog when the dog reacts anxiously or nervously to a stimulus. Therefore, this will associate the positive response with the stimulus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Blaisdell, Aaron E.|author2=James C. Denniston|author3=Hernan I. Savastano|author4=Ralph R. Miller|title=Counterconditioning of an Overshadowed Cue Attenuates Overshadowing|journal=Journal of Experimental Psychology: Animal Behavior Processes|volume=26|issue=1|year=2000|pages=74–86|publisher=The American Psychological Association, Inc.|url=http://www.psych.appstate.edu/faculty/denniston/Blaisdell%20-%20Counterconditioning.pdf|pmid=10650545|doi=10.1037/0097-7403.26.1.74|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120425044310/http://www.psych.appstate.edu/faculty/denniston/Blaisdell%20-%20Counterconditioning.pdf|archivedate=2012-04-25|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Founders ==
[[Mary Cover Jones]] was the first to show the effectiveness of the counter conditioning process in her [[rabbit]] experiments. She was able to eliminate the fear of rabbits from a young boy. The rabbit was first kept away from the boy and then moved closer and closer, while the boy was able to eat his favorite foods. The boy was allowed to touch the rabbit and then was able to eat his [[food]] to reduce the [[Anxiety|nervousness]] touching the rabbit induced. Eventually the boy was able to pet the rabbit without any sign of fear because of the unpleasant and feared stimulus of the rabbit was now replaced by the [[pleasant]] stimulus of the food. But Jones was not the only one working on this process of conditioning, [[J.B. Watson]] and [[R. Rayner]] suggested a process similar to that of Jones and also shortly after the rabbit experiments were published [[Ivan Pavlov]] used a similar procedure for a dog that was agitated by his experiments.&lt;ref name= "Craighead"&gt;{{cite book|author1=Craighead, W. Edward|author2=Charles B. Nemeroff|title=The Concise Corsini Encyclopedia of Psychology and Behavioral Science|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc.|year=2004|p=232}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Versus extinction ==
Counterconditioning is very similar to [[Extinction (psychology)|extinction]] seen in [[classical conditioning]]. It is the process of getting rid of an unwanted response. But in counterconditioning, the unwanted response does not just disappear, it is replaced by a new, wanted response. "The conditioned stimulus is presented with the [[unconditioned]] stimulus".&lt;ref name= "Craighead" /&gt; 
This also can be thought of as stimulus [[:wikt:substitution|substitution]]. The weaker stimulus will be replaced by the stronger stimulus. 
When counterconditioning is successful, the process can not just be explained by simply substitution of a stimulus. It usually is explained by things such as conditioned [[Latent inhibition|inhibition]], [[habituation]], or extinction.&lt;ref name= "Craighead" /&gt;

== Common treatment uses ==
It is a common treatment for [[aggression]], [[fears]], and [[phobias]].
The use of counter conditioning is widely used for treatment in humans as well as animals. The most common goal is to decrease or increase the want or desire to the stimulus. One of the most widely used types of counter conditioning is [[systematic desensitization]]. This technique uses muscle relaxation instead of food as the positive counter stimulus. The main goal in this treatment is to reduce fear to a certain feared stimulus.&lt;ref name= "Craighead" /&gt;

[[File:Estampe-p1000686.jpg|250px|thumb|right|To think good thoughts requires effort. This is one of the things that discipline – [[training]] – is about.]]

'''Discipline''' is [[Action (philosophy)|action]] or inaction that is [[regulation |regulated]]  to be in accordance (or to achieve accord) with a particular system of [[governance]]. Discipline is commonly applied to regulating human and [[animal behavior]], and furthermore, it is applied to each activity-branch in all branches of organized activity, knowledge, and other fields of study and observation. Discipline can be a set of expectations that are required by any governing entity including the self, groups, classes, fields, industries, or [[society |societies]].

====Use of the word discipline====

Children being educated to use [[Waste_container |public litter bins]] is a form of disciplinary education that is expected by some societies. If a child cannot use a litter bin the lack of discipline can result in a reaction from observant people in public. Many people observe a form of disciplinary effort in their daily lives. Discipline has a very important role in student's life.


Discipline is a moral obligation among many groups of people. Disciplined behavior is required by some laws and other legal obligations. Commercial entities can also put in place strict disciplinary requirements for the length of the commercial agreement. Airlines enforce strict disciplinary and conduct rules upon [[Unruly_aircraft_passenger |flight passengers]]. 

In the [[Military_justice#Trial and appeals| military]], discipline regards the efforts made by superiors to punish the serviceperson. In academia, discipline can also regard the educators' responses and efforts that are designed to punish the student(s). Not only in military, in every parts of life of an individual discipline plays the most important role. Discipline shows the actual face of an individual. In animal husbandry and training, the animals may be disciplined to perform specific task and activities without errors. Additionally, animals can discipline their young through numerous methods; including nips, bites, and grips.

==History==
Disciplinarians have been involved in many societies throughout history. The Victorian era resulted in the popular use of disciplinarian governance over children. [[Edward VIII]] had a disciplinarian father, and the English had modelled the royal families during this era. Edward's grandmother was [[Queen Victoria]] who had championed the role of the family unit during her reign. A disciplinarian will enforce a stricter set of rules that are aimed at developing children according to theories of order and discipline. Disciplinarians have also been linked to child abuse in numerous cases and biographies.

==Common Techniques==
*[[Time management]] is a form of discipline that utilizes time as the regulator and the observer of time as the governor. The requirement is for time to be used efficiently. This activity maximizes the result of a set of activities by marking each activity within a boundary of time. Time management can utilize skills, tools, or techniques to create specific time allotments according to a range of organization methods. A major theme arising from time management is that of modifying behavior to ensure compliance with time-related deadlines. This theme is interrelated with discipline and methods of discipline that can be used without punitive consequences.

*Responsibility-based discipline co-opts the participants to understand remedies for problems in an organization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Grote |first=Dick |date=2006 |title=The Birth of Discipline Without Punishment |publisher=American Management Association International |page=5 |isbn=9780814473306}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Corporal punishment|Physical punishment]] is a widely debated technique of discipline that can focus on [[spanking]], [[Slapping (strike)|slapping]], and hitting with an object using mild to extreme degrees of force. The general aim is to instil an understanding of consequence in the subject. Punishment can be used to instil immediate compliance as it acts as a reminder to the offender that there are consequences to their actions, especially when it comes to breaking the law.

The '''Dyad''' is a title used by the [[Pythagoreans]] for the number two, representing the principle of "twoness" or "otherness".

[[Numenius of Apamea]], a [[Neopythagoreanism|Neopythagorean]] philosopher in the latter 2nd century CE, said that [[Pythagoras]] gave the name of [[Monad (Greek philosophy)|Monad]] to God, and the name of Dyad to matter.&lt;ref&gt;[[Chalcidius]] r.52, 5–24, as cited in {{cite book |author=Kahn, Charles N. |title=Pythagoras and the Pythagoreans: a brief history |publisher=Hackett Pub |location=Indianapolis, IN |year=2001 |isbn=0-87220-575-4 |oclc= |doi= |page=172}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Quotation needed|date=October 2010}} Aristotle equated matter as the formation of the elements (energies) into the material world as the static material was formed by the energies being acted upon by force or motion.{{citation needed|date=April 2016}} Later [[Neoplatonism|Neoplatonic]] Philosophers and [[idealism|idealists]] like [[Plotinus]] treated the dyad as a second cause ([[demiurge]]),{{Citation needed|date=October 2010}} which was the divine mind ([[nous]]) that via a reflective nature{{Clarification needed|date=October 2010}} ([[Wikt:finite|finiteness]]) causes matter to "appear" or become perceivable.

The most popular content is TV series, soap operas, music and the illegal classifieds{{clarify|date=January 2016}} but it also contains films, video clips, Spanish language news websites, computer technology websites, instructional videos and advertisements for local Cuban businesses. Most buyers request only certain parts of the Package which may sell for as little as $1 US.&lt;ref name="nacla"/&gt;&lt;ref name="bbc-20150810"/&gt;

Since a 2011 legal property reform regarding private enterprise, a Cuban advertising firm called Etres has used the new regulations surrounding advertising to legally charge local businesses a small fee to arrange for a short clip or poster promoting their establishment to feature in the Package.&lt;ref name="bbc-20150810"/&gt;

In May 2016 it was still unknown who compiled the material or from where it was obtained.&lt;ref name="sr-20160522"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nacla"/&gt; Some have theorized that the lack of pornographic material and lack of anti-government views in the package may indicate the Cuban government is involved in its production.&lt;ref name="cbc-20150125"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="32038">'''Escalation of commitment''' is a human behavior pattern in which an individual or group facing increasingly negative outcomes from some [[Decision-making|decision]], action, or investment nevertheless continues the same behavior rather than alter course. The actor maintains behaviors that are irrational, but align with previous decisions and actions.&lt;ref name="Staw1997"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Staw|first1=Barry M.|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=C7KbGmTg3qUC|page=191}} |chapter=The escalation of commitment: An update and appraisal|editor1-last=Shapira|editor1-first=Zur|title=Organizational Decision Making|date=1997|publisher=Cambridge University Press|location=New York, NY|pages=191–215}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Economists and [[behavioral scientists]] use a related term, ''sunk-cost fallacy'', to describe the justification of increased [[investment]] of money, time, lives, etc. in a decision, based on the cumulative prior investment ("[[sunk cost]]") despite new evidence suggesting that the cost, beginning immediately, of continuing the decision outweighs the expected benefit.

In [[sociology]], ''irrational escalation of commitment'' or ''commitment bias'' describe similar behaviours. The phenomenon and the sentiment underlying it are reflected in such proverbial images as "throwing good money after bad", "in for a penny, in for a pound", and "if at first you don't succeed, try, try again".

== Early use ==
Escalation of commitment was first described by Barry M. Staw in his 1976 paper, "Knee deep in the big muddy: A study of escalating commitment to a chosen course of action".&lt;ref name=Staw1976&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Staw|first1=Barry M.|title=Knee-deep in the big muddy: a study of escalating commitment to a chosen course of action|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Performance|date=1976|volume=16|issue=1|pages=27–44|doi=10.1016/0030-5073(76)90005-2|url=http://citeseerx.ist.psu.edu/viewdoc/download?doi=10.1.1.470.3668&amp;rep=rep1&amp;type=pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers, inspired by the work of Staw, conducted studies that tested factors, situations and causes of escalation of commitment. The research introduced other analyses of situations and how people approach problems and make decisions. Some of the earliest work stemmed from events in which this phenomenon had an effect and help explain the phenomenon.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

=== Researchers define escalation of commitment ===

Over the past few decades, researchers have followed and analyzed many examples of the escalation of commitment to a situation. The heightened situations are explained in three elements. Firstly, a situation has a costly amount of resources such as time, money and people invested in the project. Next, past behavior leads up to an apex in time where the project has not met expectations or could be in a cautious state of decline. Lastly, these problems all force a decision-maker to make choices that include the options of continuing to pursue a project until completion by adding additional costs, or canceling the project altogether.&lt;ref name="Moon2001"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Moon|first1=Henry|title=The two faces of conscientiousness: Duty and achievement striving in escalation of commitment dilemmas|journal=Journal of Applied Psychology|date=2001|volume=86|issue=3|pages=533–540|doi=10.1037/0021-9010.86.3.535}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Researchers have also developed an argument regarding how  escalation of commitment is observed in two different categories.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Brockner|first1=Joel|title=The escalation of commitment to a failing course of action: toward theoretical progress|journal=Academy of Management Review|date=1992|volume=17|issue=1|pages=39–61|doi=10.5465/AMR.1992.4279568|url=http://www.gwern.net/docs/sunkcosts/1992-brockner.pdf|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160311233821/http://www.gwern.net/docs/sunkcosts/1992-brockner.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-11|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many researchers believe that the need to escalate resources is linked to [[expectancy theory]]. "According to such a viewpoint, decision makers assess the probability that additional resource allocations will lead to goal attainment, as well as the value of goal attainment (i.e., rewards minus costs), and thereby generate a subjective expected utility associated with the decision to allocate additional resources."&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; The next phase of the escalation process is self-justification and rationalizing if the decision the leader made used resources well, if the resources being used were used to make positive change, and assuring themselves that the decision they chose was right. Leaders must balance costs and benefits of any problem to produce a final decision. What matters most often in assuring the leader that they made the right choice regardless of the final outcome is if their decision is what others believed in.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt;

Research conducted on the topic has been taken from many other forms and theories of psychology. Many believe that what researchers have done thus far to explain this behavior is best analyzed  and tested through situational development and resource allocation.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt;

Other research has identified circumstances that lead to the opposite of escalation of commitment, namely deescalation of commitment. This research explains the factors that influence whether escalation or deescalation of commitment is more likely to occur through the role of budgeting and mental accounting.&lt;ref&gt;Heath, Chip. "Escalation and de-escalation of commitment in response to sunk costs: The role of budgeting in mental accounting." ''Organizational Behavior and Human Decision Processes'' 62 (1995): 38-38.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vietnam War ===

Escalation of commitment can many times cause behavior change by means of locking into resources. One of the first examples of escalation of commitment was described by [[George Ball (diplomat)|George Ball]], who wrote to President [[Lyndon Johnson]] to explain to him the predictions of the war outcome:&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

{{quote|The decision you face now is crucial. Once large numbers of U.S. troops are committed to direct combat, they will begin to take heavy casualties in a war they are ill equipped to fight in a noncooperative if not downright hostile countryside. Once we suffer large casualties, we will have started a well-nigh irreversible process. Our involvement will be so great that we cannot—without national humiliation—stop short of achieving our complete objectives. Of the two possibilities, I think humiliation would be more likely than the achievement of our objectives—even after we have paid terrible costs.&lt;ref name="Gettleman1995"&gt;Ball, George (July 1, 1965). "Memo from George Ball to President Johnson. A Compromise Solution in South Vietnam". In {{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=SVtNalqmYgAC&amp;pg=PA283|last=Gettleman|first=Marvin E.|title=Vietnam and America: A Documented History|year=1995|publisher=Grove Press|isbn=978-0-8021-3362-5|pages=282–283}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

== Theories ==
=== Self-justification theory ===

[[Self-justification theory|Self-justification]] thought process is a part of commitment decisions of leaders and managers of a group and can therefore cause a rise in commitment levels.&lt;ref name="Huning2014"&gt;{{Cite journal|title = The Impact of Performance Attributions on Escalation of Commitment|last = Huning|first = Tobias M|date = 2014|volume = 18|issue = 1|journal = Journal of Organizational Culture, Communications and Conflict|doi = |pmid = |access-date = |last2 = Thomson|first2 = Neal F|url = http://www.alliedacademies.org/articles/jocccvol17no22013.pdf|deadurl = bot: unknown|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20160623232138/http://www.alliedacademies.org/articles/jocccvol17no22013.pdf#page=157|archivedate = 2016-06-23|df = }}&lt;/ref&gt; This attitude provides "one explanation for why people escalate commitment to their past investments."&lt;ref name="Kelly2013"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia|title = Escalation of Commitment|last = Kelly|first = Theresa F|publisher = Sage Publications, Inc|year = 2013|isbn = |location = Thousand Oaks, CA|pages =256–259 |encyclopedia= Encyclopedia of Management Theory|last2 = Milkman|first2 = Katherine L|editor1-last=Kessler|editor1-first= Eric H|doi=10.4135/9781452276090.n78|ISBN= 9781412997829|url={{google books |plainurl=y |id=4wtzAwAAQBAJ|page=256}}}}&lt;/ref&gt; Managers make decisions that reflect previous behavior. Managers tend to recall and follow information that is aligned to their behavior to create consistency for their current and future decisions. If a group member or outside party recognizes inconsistent decision making, this can alter the leadership role of the manager. Managers have external influence from society, peers, and authority, which can significantly alter a manager's perception on what factors realistically matter when making decisions.&lt;ref name="Huning2014" /&gt;

=== Prospect theory ===

[[Prospect theory]] helps to describe the natural reactions and processes involved in making a decision in a risk-taking situation. Prospect theory makes the argument for how levels of wealth, whether that is people, money, or time, affect how a decision is made. Researchers were particularly interested in how one perceives a situation based on costs and benefits.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; The framing to how the problem is introduced is crucial for understanding and thinking of the probability that the situation will either work in favor or against you and how to prepare for those changes. "Whyte (1986) argued that prospect theory provides the psychological mechanism by which to explain escalating commitment to a failing course of action without the need to invoke self-justification processes. (Fiegenbaum &amp; Thomas, 1988: 99)"&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; Prospect theorists believe that one's use of this process is when there is a negative downfall in the stakes that will affect the outcome of the project. To ensure they will not fail, the individual may add more resources to assure them that they will succeed. Although this theory seems realistic, researchers "Davis and Bobko (1986) found no effect of personal responsibility on continued commitment to the previous course of action in the positive frame condition."&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; Which means that escalation of commitment will be lower in the higher responsibility situation.

=== Attribution theory ===

The [[attribution theory]], originating from [[Fritz Heider]], "attempts to find causal explanations for events and human behaviors." This theory approaches two methods of inquiry including locus of causality and stability.&lt;ref name="Huning2014" /&gt; Locus of causality reflects on internal characteristics of an individual, such as intelligence levels and attention seeking, with the relationship of the external space such as weather forecasts and task difficulty.&lt;ref name="Huning2014" /&gt; Aspects of control become a significant factor in how a manager justifies a decision made. Managers will use the relationship between internal and external factors to describe why they made a decision to a single point of view. Managers may justify their actions by explaining that this was out of their personal control of the event, or they could believe that the decision could not be controlled by anyone else. Research suggests that "the type of attribution made by an employee across these dimensions is likely to impact an employee's tendency to engage in the negative emotional activity referred to as escalation of commitment."&lt;ref name="Huning2014" /&gt;

=== Social identity theory ===

Identity is a large part of how we move through the world. Private thoughts and opinions as well as the effect of others create the [[social identity theory]]. People make connections between their use of groups and their own view of themselves, which researchers have discovered motivates people to keep their social status and to defend it whenever it is endangered.&lt;ref name="Dietz-Uhler1996"&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = The escalation of commitment in political decision-making groups: a social identity approach|last = Dietz-Uhler|first = Beth|journal = European Journal of Social Psychology|date=1996|volume=26|issue=4|pages=611–629|doi=10.1002/(SICI)1099-0992(199607)26:4&lt;611::AID-EJSP781&gt;3.0.CO;2-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Theoretical models ===

==== Temporal model of escalation ====
Groups engage in temporal comparisons, which means that you compare actions and behaviors at "different points in time."&lt;ref name="Dietz-Uhler1996" /&gt; This is a form of social identity scenario. This type of comparison can be made when a decision seems unproductive and forces team members to consider any threat to the group.&lt;ref name="Dietz-Uhler1996" /&gt;

==== Aggregate model ====
"The aggregate model's emphasis is upon the accumulation and balance of forces rather than the ordering of effects over time."&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt; The model is general and can provide an ideal view as to how. The effects whether positive or negative are defined by micro and macro forces. This model goes by situation rather than what researchers have defined as the norm. There is no process to follow, which makes it very useful for researchers because they can understand a situation more clearly as well as see the bigger picture of the situation.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

== Determinants ==
The main drivers of the tendency to continue investing in losing propositions are project, psychological, social, and structural.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sleesman|first1=Dustin J.|last2=Conlon|first2=Donald E.|last3=McNamara|first3=Gerry|last4=Miles|first4=Jonathan E.|title=Cleaning Up the Big Muddy: A Meta-Analytic Review of the Determinants of Escalation of Commitment|journal=Academy of Management Journal|date=2012|volume=55|issue=3|pages=541–562|doi=10.5465/amj.2010.0696}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Project ===

Project determinants are those that refer to the original commitments and decisions made at a project's beginning. This includes general project characteristics and initial financial costs.&lt;ref name="Liang2014"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Liang|first1=Beichen|last2=Kale|first2=Sudhir H.|last3=Cherian|first3=Joseph|title=Is the future static or dynamic? The role of culture on escalation of commitment in new product development|journal=Industrial Marketing Management|date=2014|volume=43|issue=1|pages=155–163|doi=10.1016/j.indmarman.2013.08.009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among them, decision risk, opportunity cost information, and information acquisition have been found to have negative relationships with escalation of commitment. Decision uncertainty, positive performance trend information, and expressed preference for initial decision have been found to have positive relationships.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"/&gt;

High costs of ending a project or changing its course, potential financial gain upon completion, and extensive structure can factor in to escalation of commitment, making it difficult to walk away from the project. Preventing future monetary loss, potential savings, and having clearly available alternatives can allow for avoidance of the behavior. In studies by Teger and later Ross and Staw, situations where ending an action costs more than completing it resulted in decision makers being trapped in their current, costly behaviors.&lt;ref name="Staw1997"/&gt;

=== Psychological ===

Psychological determinants are those that refer to internal views on the actions and information involved in a project. This can include cognitive factors, personality, and emotions as they relate to project elements.&lt;ref name="Liang2014" /&gt; Of these, sunk costs, time investment, decision maker experience and expertise, self-efficacy and confidence, personal responsibility for the initial decision, ego threat, and proximity to project completion have been found to have positive relationships with escalation of commitment, while anticipated regret and positive information framing have been found to have negative relationships.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"/&gt;

Optimism and belief that one has control over what will still be positive outcomes lead to continued self-justification of commitment to actions. People add to their initial personal investments in the hope they will overcome currently negative results. This was illustrated in a case study by Staw, where providing business students with manipulated responsibilities for initial decisions and their outcomes resulted in the greatest commitment to increased actions and resources when the initial decision assigned was made directly by the student with poor outcomes.&lt;ref name="Staw1997"/&gt; In these instances, people take further risk in an attempt to avoid further problems. This is even more likely when subjects view current issues as having unstable reasoning rather than stable reasoning, or when the individual is unwilling to admit mistakes.&lt;ref name="Brockner1992" /&gt; They then believe the situation will stabilize or turn around. [[Confirmation bias]] can also lead to escalation of commitment as individuals are then less likely to recognize the negative results of their decisions.&lt;ref name="Kelly2013" /&gt; On the other hand, if the results are recognized, they can be blamed on unforeseeable events occurring during the course of the project.

The effect of sunk costs is often seen escalating commitment. When the amount of investment is greater and can not be recovered, the desire to avoid complete loss of those resources and keeping with impression management prompts continued investment over pulling out.&lt;ref name="Kelly2013" /&gt; Relatedly, as invested resources can include time, closeness to completion of a project yields similar results. More value is placed on project when they are early or late in their process due to the clarity of completion goals at those points.&lt;ref name=Horn2012&gt;{{cite thesis|first1=Marianna|last1=Horn|title=The downside of persistence: The effects of mood on an escalation of commitment paradigm|date=2012|url=https://etd.auburn.edu/handle/10415/3290?show=full|HDL=10415/3290}}&lt;/ref&gt; It's more likely that risks will be taken at these points than in a project closer to a visible midpoint.

=== Social ===

Social determinants are those that refer to the expectations and influence of other individuals or groups on project actions. Included in these, group identity or cohesive strength has been found to have the most influence on escalation of commitment while public evaluation of decision and resistance to decision from others has little significance in relation.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"/&gt;

==== External justification and binding ====
Individuals present themselves cautiously to others in the environment. They don't concentrate on themselves and what they believe is accurate and competent—they are only interested in their organization appearing competent. Escalation of commitment is about decision making that usually comes in a form of a group or individual deciding a course of action. Managers have a responsibility to choose the fate of what a group of people have been working on. A manager who decides to back a team out of a project isn't concerned that the project failed, they are concerned that team members may think the manager is incompetent. Studies that tested this phenomenon included factors such as policy resistance, job insecurity (Fox &amp; Staw 1979), and audience size (Rubin &amp; Lang 1981). All showed a spike in commitment when these realistic factors are present. This mental and emotional response is referred to as the face-saving effect. Individuals who are responsible for others are constantly checking themselves to assure that their actions and beliefs are parallel to the expectations for their viewers. One's social identity to the public can decide your fate. For example, a team can identify a level of commitment and personal connection to an idea or project. Team members consistently use statements like "that project is Bob's baby," or "oh, we had the same idea." Both ends of the spectrum are crucial to how others view and analyze a situation, especially something that failed.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

==== Leadership norms ====
Leaders are responsible for guiding a team through the difficult problems into a solution. Although many times, the negative aspects of commitments can discussed in more detail and importance, there are many social rewards that are positive. One example of this phenomenon is persistence. A project on the verge of failure is a manager's responsibility to revive, but with persistence, a manager can get rewarded to turning a bad project into something great. Rewards are earned for turning around a team to produce something successful. When managers stick to their goals, and get their team to produce responsibly.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

=== Structural ===

Structural determinants are those that refer to the cultural and environmental features and resources of the project's overall organization. The minimal research available on them indicates that agency problems most influence escalation of commitment.&lt;ref name="Sleesman2012"/&gt;

There are macro-level variables that affect the organizational structure of a team and how the make decisions. Decisions are made based on individuals in a group setting with specific roles and responsibilities and effect decisions that are a product of interaction in the team. The determinant that affects escalation of commitment is institutional inertia. This phenomenon is used to describe how individual attitudes and behavior changes frequently, so therefore, a group's stature is also unpredictable and controllable. "Organizations have very imperfect sensory systems, making them relatively impervious to changes in their environments."&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

This is one factor that plays a role in how issues are addressed. When there are a group of individuals involved in communication, decisions, and change, with the lack of consistency in the group, most of the tasks fail to complete. This phenomenon occurs in situations such as policy change, rulings and procedures.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

This issue can also cause havoc for an organization when they are too attached to a policy, thought process or identity because they are not free to change. "On occasion, a project, product, or policy can become so closely tied to the values and purposes of the organization that it becomes almost unthinkable to consider withdrawal."&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt; One primary example of this phenomenon is the downfall of the [[Pan American World Airways]] company, commonly known as Pan Am. Pan Am was a well known airlines and hotel with hundreds of employees. With the turn of industry, airline policies were deregulated and caused financial downfall for Pan Am. The company over time made cuts to their company to stay afloat. The company believed that their image of being an airline was more important than being a successful company that they removed all of the assets that were in fact making them the largest amount of revenue only to save the image they thought they needed to remain to be Pan Am.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

== Groups vs individuals ==
In groups, it can be more difficult to attribute issues to a single, simpler determinant. While determinants are still applicable, oftentimes there are more complex factors when organizational goals and actions misalign. Groups, especially as they grow larger, can be resistant to changing course.

Even if the need to change course or cease action is recognized, communication speed, policies, and business politics can be hindrances.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt; A larger organization, especially one with a spread of subgroups, has to communicate the argument and decision to go against previous actions across the appropriate levels. If this communication does not occur in a timely manner or is blocked, the final decision may not be made and acted upon. A decision that goes against existing rules and processes may also reach resistance even with support from those within the organization. Individuals and groups that are directly employed due to a project, have financial stake in it may provide enough opposition to prevent changes from being made as well. They feel personally responsible for the parts they've worked on and can also feel that they too are being replaced or terminated.&lt;ref name="Stray2012"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Stray|first1=Viktoria Gulliksen|last2=Moe|first2=Nils Brede|last3=Dybå|first3=Tore|chapter=Escalation of Commitment: A Longitudinal Case Study of Daily Meetings|date=2012|volume=111|pages=153–167|doi=10.1007/978-3-642-30350-0_11|title=Agile Processes in Software Engineering and Extreme Programming|ISBN=978-3-642-30349-4|series= Lecture Notes in Business Information Processing}}&lt;/ref&gt; Escalation of commitment can then occur in any of these situations. External groups can play an even larger part in escalating commitment if their power is greater than that of the group taking action and they use that power to directly lead and influence.&lt;ref name="Staw1997" /&gt;

With a larger number of decision makers included, groups have the opportunity for greater productivity than single individuals, but they also have the opportunity for greater losses and escalation.&lt;ref name="Bazerman1984"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bazerman|first1=Max H.|last2=Giuliano|first2=Toni|last3=Appelman|first3=Alan|title=Escalation of commitment in individual and group decision making|journal=Organizational Behavior and Human Performance|date=1984|volume=33|issue=2|pages=141–152|doi=10.1016/0030-5073(84)90017-5|url=http://www.gwern.net/docs/sunkcosts/1984-bazerman.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160318080454/http://www.gwern.net/docs/sunkcosts/1984-bazerman.pdf|archivedate=2016-03-18|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Members can eliminate some of the escalation potential if they come to a better decision earlier on in the process and avoid the need to change course dramatically. Yet they can also hold onto a larger base of support for their initial actions to the point where escalation potential is increased. In this case, [[groupthink]] assists in keeping with the original decision and pressures towards conformity rather than dividing the group with other options. Also, a group whose members are not cohesive can have decreased escalation potential due to conflicts and varying levels of inclusion in the process.&lt;ref name="Bazerman1984" /&gt;

Organizations that are family businesses are especially prone to escalation of commitment due to the added level of going through the family structure in addition to the business structure, allowing for further conflicts between the two.&lt;ref name="Woods2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Woods|first1=Jeremy A.|last2=Dalziel|first2=Thomas|last3=Barton|first3=Sidney L.|title=Escalation of commitment in private family businesses: The influence of outside board members|journal=Journal of Family Business Strategy|date=2012|volume=3|issue=1|pages=18–27|doi=10.1016/j.jfbs.2012.01.002|url=http://jeremyawoods.com/documents/Research/Woods%20Dalziel%20Barton%202012.pdf|deadurl=bot: unknown|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160504212721/http://jeremyawoods.com/documents/Research/Woods%20Dalziel%20Barton%202012.pdf|archivedate=2016-05-04|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Business reputation, customer and share loss, and financial loss become risks.

The '''Filipino value system''' or '''Filipino values''' refers to the set of [[values (heritage)|values]] or the [[value system]] that a majority of the Filipino have historically held important in their lives. This Philippine values system includes their own unique assemblage of consistent [[ideologies]], [[moral codes]], [[ethics|ethical practices]], [[etiquette]] and [[personal and cultural values|cultural and personal values]] that are promoted by their society. As with any society though, the values that an individual holds sacred can differ on the basis of religion, upbringing and other factors.

As a general description, the distinct value system of Filipinos is rooted primarily in personal alliance systems, especially those based in kinship, obligation, friendship, religion (particularly [[Christianity]]) and commercial relationships.&lt;ref name=CAPH&gt;[http://countrystudies.us/philippines/41.htm ''Social Values and Organization''], Philippines, country studies.us&lt;/ref&gt;

==Philosophical basis==

Filipino values are, for the most part, centered at maintaining social harmony, motivated primarily by the desire to be accepted within a group. The main sanction against diverging from these values are the concepts of "''Hiya''", roughly translated as 'a sense of shame', and "''Amor propio''" or 'self-esteem'.&lt;ref name="Phil"&gt;{{cite book |author1=Chris Rowthorn |author2=Greg Bloom |title=Philippines |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aaUR07G0yAcC |year=2006 |publisher=Lonely Planet |isbn=978-1-74104-289-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Social approval, acceptance by a group, and belonging to a group are major concerns. Caring about what others will think, say or do, are strong influences on social behavior among Filipinos.&lt;ref name=Didache&gt;Hallig, Jason V. [http://didache.nts.edu/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=277&amp;Itemid ''Communicating Holiness to the Filipinos: Challenges and Needs''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110720015814/http://didache.nts.edu/index.php?option=com_docman&amp;task=doc_view&amp;gid=277&amp;Itemid |date=2011-07-20 }}, The Path to a Filipino Theology of Holiness, on pages 2 and 10, http://didache.nts.edu.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the anthropologist Leonardo Mercado, the Filipino worldview is basically 'nondualistic'. Based on his linguistic analyses of Filipino value terms like ''[[loob]]'' (Cebuano ''buot''), he concludes that Filipinos desire harmony, not only in interpersonal relationships, but also with nature and religion, while still remaining nondichotomous.&lt;ref name="FCT"&gt;{{cite book|author=Rolando M. Gripaldo|title=Filipino cultural traits: Claro R. Ceniza lectures|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=hXJe6vKMjroC|year=2005|publisher=CRVP|isbn=978-1-56518-225-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

|text= "The Filipino wants to harmonize the object and the subject, while at the same time holding both as distinct."
|sign= ''Elements of Filipino Philosophy'' (1974), Leonardo Mercado, [[Divine Word Missionaries|SVD]]
}}

Florentino Timbreza, a cultural philosopher, concludes in his book ''Pilosopiyang Pilipino'' (1982) that Filipino values are based on the significance of the world to man. Life experiences dictate the philosophy of the Filipino, augmented by other sources like proverbs, folk sayings, folk tales, and the like.&lt;ref name="FCT" /&gt;

==Models of the Filipino values==

F. Landa Jocano identified two models of the Filipino value system. The first is the '''exogenous model''' or the '''foreign model''', while the second is the '''indigenous model''' or the '''traditional model'''. The foreign model is described to be a "legal and formal" model. The indigenous model is described as a "traditional and non-formal" model or guide but is deeply embedded in the [[subconscious]] of the Filipinos.&lt;ref name=Didache /&gt;

The foreign model was inherited by Filipinos from [[Western cultures]], particularly from the [[Spaniards]] and the [[United States|Americans]]. An example of a foreign or exogenous influence is [[bureaucracy]] exhibited in the [[government of the Philippines]].&lt;ref name=Didache /&gt;

==Elements and composition of Filipino values==
Based on studies, surveys, opinions, anecdotes, and other literatures made by experts and researchers in relation to '''Filipino social values''' or '''Filipino core values''', along with the [[Filipino character]] or [[Filipino identity]] of a person or an individual known as the Filipino, the Filipino value system are found to possess inherent key elements.

One can note how ''Hiya'' (propriety/dignity)'', [https://tl.wiktionary.org/wiki/pakikisama Pakikisama]''(companionship/esteem)'','' and ''[[Utang na loob]]''(gratitude/solidarity), are merely '''Surface Values'''—readily seen and observed values exhibited and esteemed by many Filipinos. These three values are considered branches from a single origin—the actual '''Core Value''' of the Filipino Personality—''Kapwa''. It means 'togetherness', and refers to community, or not doing things alone. ''Kapwa'' has two categories, ''Ibang Tao'' (other people) and ''Hindi Ibang Tao'' (not other people). The Surface Values spin off of the Core Value through the '''Pivotal Aspect''' of ''Pakikiramdam,'' or shared inner perception ("Feeling for another").

Other notable key elements or motivations are [[optimism]] about the future, [[pessimism]] with regards to present situations and events, the concern and care for other people, the existence of friendship and friendliness, the habit of being hospitable, religious nature, respectfulness to self and others, respect for the female members of society, the fear of God, and abhorrence of acts of cheating and thievery.&lt;ref name="CRVP2"&gt;Talisayon, Serafin. [http://www.crvp.org/book/Series03/III-7/chapter_xiii.htm ''Filipino Values''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160417164213/http://www.crvp.org/book/Series03/III-7/chapter_xiii.htm |date=2016-04-17 }}, Chapeter XIII, Teaching Values in the Natural and Physical Sc54654
iences in the Philippines, crvp.orgp&lt;/ref&gt;

The values of Filipinos specifically upholds the following items: solidarity of the family unit, security of the Philippine economy, orientation to small-groups, personalism, the concepts of "''[[loob]]''" or "''[[kalooban]]''" (meaning "what’s inside the self", the "inner-self", or the "actual personal feelings of the self"), existence and maintenance of smooth [[interpersonal relationships]], and the sensing of the feelings or needs of others (known as ''pakikiramdam''). In a larger picture, these values are grouped into general clusters or "macroclusters": namely, the relationship cluster, the social cluster, the livelihood cluster, the inwardness cluster, and the optimism cluster.&lt;ref name="CRVP2"/&gt;

==Enumeration of Filipino values==

=== Human activities ===

This is the shared sense of identity and consciousness of the 'other'. It means treating others with respect and dignity as an equal, not someone below the individual.

=== Family orientation ===

The basic and most important unit of a Filipino's life is the family. Unlike in Western countries, young Filipinos who turn 18 are not expected to move out of their parents' home. When a Filipino's parents are old and cannot take care of themselves, they are cared for in their children's homes and are very rarely brought by their children to Homes for the Aged. The practice of separating the elderly from the rest of the family, while common in Western countries, is often looked down upon in Filipino society. Family lunches with the whole clan with up to 50 people, extending until the line of second cousins, are not unusual. The Filipino puts a great emphasis on the value of family and being close to one's family members.

=== Joy and humor ===

This famous trait is the ability of Filipinos to find humour in everything. It sheds light on the optimism and positivity of Filipinos in whatever situation they are in so as to remain determined in going through struggles or challenges. It serves as a coping technique, the same way a child who has fallen laughs at himself/herself to hide his/her embarrassment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|url = |title = Pagbabalik-Loob|last = Maggay|first = Melba|date = 1993|journal = Moral Recovery and Cultural Reaffirmation|doi = |pmid = |access-date = }}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Flexibility, adaptability, and creativity ===

Studies show that Filipinos often have an aversion to a set of standardised rules or procedures; They are known to follow a "natural clock" or organic sense of time—doing things in the time they feel is right. They are present-oriented: which means that one attends to a task or requirement at the time it is needed and does not worry much about future engagements. This allows the Filipino to adapt and be flexible in doing the tasks at times not bound to a particular schedule or timeframe. This allows them think on their feet and be creative in facing whatever challenge or task they have even when it is already right in front of them.

=== Faith and religiosity ===

The Philippines is approximately 85 percent Christians (mostly Roman Catholics ), 10 percent Muslim, and 5 percent 'other' religions, including the Taoist-Buddhist religious beliefs of Chinese and the 'indigenous' animistic beliefs of some peoples in upland areas that resisted 300 years of Spanish colonial rule.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Christianity in the Philippines|url = http://www.seasite.niu.edu/crossroads/russell/christianity.htm|website = www.seasite.niu.edu|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a reflection of the Filipinos' strong faith in God as seen in their various practices. This includes the numerous church holidays they observe, the customary (and obligatory) Sunday Mass, the individual's basis of their moral standpoints, the influence of the Church on the minds, actions, and opinions of the majority, importance of the Sacraments, praying at almost any possible time of the day, the extreme practices during Holy Week,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Will these 10 traditional Holy Week practices survive? |work=The Philippine Star |url = http://www.philstar.com/news-feature/2015/04/03/1440221/will-these-10-traditional-holy-week-practices-survive|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Ability to survive ===

The Filipinos as a people who have been constantly under the rule of numerous powerful countries has over time, developed a sense of resourcefulness or the ability to survive with whatever they have. They have the extraordinary ability to make something out of almost nothing. If a Filipino was given just a screwdriver, plastic bagseut, and some tape, he would still be able to build a bird tree, especially for the sake of survival, and provided that he be allowed to hunt for some needed surrounding material.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Life and Times of the Filipino-American: The Resourcefulness of the Filipino|url = http://filipinoamericanpinay.blogspot.com/2012/07/resourcefulness-of-filipino.html|website = Life and Times of the Filipino-American|date = 2012-07-10|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Hard work And Industriousness ===

With resourcefulness comes hard work. Filipinos are very determined and persevering in accomplishing whatever they set their minds to. &lt;blockquote&gt;Filipinos over the years have proven time and time again that they are a people with an industrious attitude. Sadly, this is seen by others as Filipinos being only useful as domestic helpers, working abroad to help their families in the country. This is also present in the country’s workforce particularly the farmers. Even with little support, technological weaknesses and the country’s seasonal typhoons, the Filipino farmer still strives to earn their daily meal.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ASIAN JOURNAL {{!}} The best traits of Filipinos that we should be proud of|url = http://asianjournalusa.com/the-best-traits-of-filipinos-that-we-should-be-proud-of-p10881-67.htm|website = asianjournalusa.com|accessdate = 2015-12-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

=== Hospitality ===
[[Alien (law)|Foreigners]] who come to visit the Philippines speak of Filipinos going out of their way to help them when lost, or the heartwarming generosity of a Filipino family hosting a visitor in their poverty-stricken home. Meanwhile, most foreigners who attend Filipino gatherings abroad (which are frequently organized for hundreds of reasons) testify to the warmth and friendliness of Filipinos as they experience that feeling of “belongingness.” Indeed, the legendary Filipino hospitality is not limited to the Philippines. It is everywhere wherever there are Filipinos.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = Global nation Inquirer: What Filipinos can be proud of|url = http://globalnation.inquirer.net/45875/what-filipinos-can-be-proud-of|website = globalnation.inquirer.net|accessdate = 2016-08-21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gender-specific values==

In relation to parenthood, bearing male and female children depends on the preferences of the parents based on the expected roles that each gender would assume once grown up. Both genders are expected to become responsible members of the family and their society. [[Women in the Philippines]] are expected to become caring and nurturing mothers for their own children.&lt;ref name=CCSF&gt;MLY. [http://www.ccsf.edu/Departments/Philippine_Studies/event2.html ''Keynote Speech''], City College of San Francisco in the Conference on "''The Filipino Family in the 21st Century: Issues and Challenges''", ccsf.edu, October 27, 2001&lt;/ref&gt;

Female Filipinos are also expected to lend a hand in household work. They are even anticipated to offer assistance after being married. On the other hand, [[men in the Philippines|Filipino men]] are expected to assume the role of becoming the primary source of income and financial support of his family.&lt;ref name="CCSF"/&gt;

'''First-year composition''' (sometimes known as '''freshman composition''' or '''freshman writing''') is an introductory core curriculum [[writing]] course in  American colleges.  This course focuses on improving students' abilities to write in a university setting and introduces students to writing practices in the disciplines and professions.&lt;ref&gt;Duffy, John. "[http://www.insidehighered.com/views/2012/03/16/essay-value-first-year-writing-courses| Essay on the Value of First-year Writing Courses]." ''[[Inside Higher Ed]]''. March 16, 2012.&lt;/ref&gt; These courses are traditionally required of incoming students, thus the previous name, "Freshman Composition". Scholars working within the field of Composition-Rhetoric often have teaching First-year composition (FYC) courses  as the practical focus of their scholarly work. 

FYC courses are structured in a variety of ways.  Some institutions of higher education require only one term of FYC, while others require two or three courses. There are a number of identifiable [[Pedagogy|pedagogies]] associated with FYC, including: [[formalist theory in composition studies|current-traditional]], [[theories of rhetoric and composition pedagogy|expressivist]], [[Cognitive rhetoric|social-epistemic]], [[Process theory of composition|process]], post-process and [[Writing about Writing]] (WAW). Each of these [[pedagogy|pedagogies]] can generate a multitude of curricula. 

Composition professionals, including those with degrees in Writing Studies and [[Rhetoric]] and [[Composition Studies|Composition]], often focus on a rhetorical approach to help students learn how to apply an understanding of [[audience]], purpose, [[Context (language use)|context]], invention, and [[Stylistics (literature)|style]] to their writing processes. This rhetorical approach has shown that real writing, rather than existing as isolated modes, has more to do with a writer choosing from among many approaches to perform rhetorical tasks.{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}} In addition to a focus on rhetoric, many first year composition courses also emphasize writing process, where students are encouraged to interact with classmates and receive feedback to be used for [[revision (writing) | revision]].  These practices can take the form of essay [[peer review]] or workshopping. [[Electronic Portfolio|Portfolios]] are a common way of assessing revised student work.&lt;ref&gt;"[http://www.ncte.org/cccc/resources/positions/electronicportfolios| Principles and Practices in Electronic Portfolios]." Conference on College Composition and Communication, 2007.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==

Since the late nineteenth century, college courses on composition have become increasingly common in American higher education.&lt;ref&gt;Crowley, Sharon. ''Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays''. Pittsburgh, University of Pittsburgh Press: 1998.&lt;/ref&gt; Although a longstanding course offering at many colleges, first-year composition remains controversial and marginalized.&lt;ref&gt;Miller, Susan. ''Textual Carnivals: The Politics of Composition.'' Carbondale and Edwardsville, IL: Southern Illinois University Press, 1991. &lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Holbrook, Sue Ellen. "Women's Work: The Feminizing of Composition." ''Rhetoric Review'' 9(2) 1991: 201-229. &lt;/ref&gt;

===First-year requirement debate===

The requirement for a first-year composition course has been debated in [[composition studies]]. This debate centers around how effective the first-year composition course is and the changes that need to be made to develop the field of composition. While most schools do require some form of the first-year composition course, there are some schools that have decided to abolish the first-year composition requirement. Some scholars, such as Sharon Crowley in ''Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays,'' argue that this requirement should be abolished. Crowley does not suggest the course itself be removed, only the requirement that all freshmen take the course. She states that students would still be interested in the course if the requirement was abolished and that removing the requirement would strengthen the field of composition. She implies that composition studies is marginalized within the university because of the view of the first-year composition course as a skill course. Removing the requirement, she states, would remove the association of composition studies with introductory courses, giving more acknowledgement to the field. &lt;ref&gt; Crowley, Sharon. ''Composition in the University: Historical and Polemical Essays''. Pittsburgh: University of Pittsburgh Press, 1998. pg 241-43. Print. &lt;/ref&gt; Crowley's opinion initiated a debate in the composition field, but she is not the only critic who advocates for the removal of this requirement. Scholars Douglas Downs and Elizabeth Wardle also dislike the requirement and instead argue for a writing studies curriculum. &lt;ref&gt; Downs, Douglas and Elizabeth Wardle. ''Teaching About Writing, Righting Misconceptions: (Re)Envisioning 'First-Year Composition' as 'Introduction to Writing Studies'''. College Composition and Communication. 58.4 (2007) 552-584. Web. &lt;/ref&gt; However, there are scholars who do not agree with this stance, argue that the first-year composition course is needed in the university, and believe that the requirement should remain. Scholar David Smit is one critic who favors keeping the requirement. He suggests that the requirement can be kept and the curriculum and structure of the first-year composition course altered for improvement. Smit explains that many of the developmental goals of those who favor abolishing the requirement can still be achieved by offering more writing experiences. He proposes more genre writing in composition courses with a "[[scaffolding]]" progression of discipline writing. If this was done, he suggests, the concerns over the status of composition studies in the university would still be solved, as the course would no longer be seen as skills based. &lt;ref&gt; Smit, David. ''The End of Composition Studies''. Carbondale: Southern Illinois University Press, 2004. pg 183-85. Print. &lt;/ref&gt; There has been no consensus reached in composition studies regarding the status of the first-year composition course requirement. The benefits of the course, as well as the drawbacks, continue to be debated and the scholars noted above are only a few of the voices and perspectives involved in this discussion. Despite the debate about the requirement, it remains in effect at a majority of universities{{Citation needed|date=January 2018}}.

==Structure of contemporary first-year composition==

First-year composition is designed to meet the goals for successful completion set forth by the [http://wpacouncil.org/positions/outcomes.html/ Council of Writing Program Administrators]. To reach these goals, students must learn rhetorical conventions, [[critical thinking]] skills, [[information literacy]], and the process of writing an academic paper. While there is no American standard curriculum for first-year composition, curriculum is developed at several levels, including the state, institution, department, and [[Writing center|writing program]].

=== First-year composition and rhetoric ===

With the publication of James Kinneavy's ''Theory of Discourse'' in 1971, English departments began incorporating [[rhetoric]] into their composition classrooms.&lt;ref&gt;Clark, Irene. ''Concepts in Composition: Theory and Practice in the Teaching of Writing.'' Mahweh, NJ: Lawrence Erlbaum Associates, 2003. p 6.&lt;/ref&gt; In doing this, composition instructors have placed more emphasis on teaching [[audience analysis]], [[Aristotle]]'s three appeals ([[ethos]], [[pathos]], and [[logos]]), and teaching Kinneavy's modes of discourse.
According to Brian Sutton in "Writing in the Disciplines, First-Year Composition, and the Research Paper," since 1980, there has been an increasing debate in academic circles as to whether the "generic" approach to writing in first year composition is useful for students whose future writing will be discipline specific (46).&lt;ref&gt;Sutton, Brian. "Writing in the Disciplines, First-Year Composition, and the Research Paper." ''Language and Learning Across the Disciplines'' 2.1 (1997) 46–57. Web.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Basic writing===

First described by [[Mina P. Shaughnessy|Mina Shaughnessy]] in the 1970s, [[Basic writing]] is a division of composition studies that strives to bring disadvantaged students entering college to a more complete understanding of the rhetorical aspects of the writing process.&lt;ref&gt;Otte, George, and Rebecca Mlynarczyk.

The '''impedance analogy''' is a method of representing a mechanical system by an analogous electrical system.  The advantage of doing this is that there is a large body of theory and analysis techniques concerning complex electrical systems, especially in the field of [[electronic filter|filters]].&lt;ref&gt;Talbot-Smith, p. 1.86&lt;/ref&gt;  By converting to an electrical representation, these tools in the electrical domain can be directly applied to a mechanical system without modification.  A further advantage occurs in [[electromechanics|electromechanical systems]]:  Converting the mechanical part of such a system into the electrical domain allows the entire system to be analysed as a unified whole. 

The mathematical behaviour of the simulated electrical system is identical to the mathematical behaviour of the represented mechanical system.  Each [[Electrical element|element]] in the electrical domain has a corresponding element in the mechanical domain with an analogous [[constitutive equation]].   Every law of [[circuit analysis]], such as [[Kirchhoff's circuit laws|Kirchhoff's laws]], that apply in the electrical domain also applies to the mechanical impedance analogy. 

The impedance analogy is one of the two main [[mechanical-electrical analogies]] used for representing mechanical systems in the electrical domain, the other being the [[mobility analogy]].  The roles of voltage and current are reversed in these two methods, and the electrical representations produced are the [[dual impedance|dual circuits]] of each other.  The impedance analogy preserves the analogy between [[electrical impedance]] and [[mechanical impedance]] whereas the mobility analogy does not.  On the other hand, the mobility analogy preserves the topology of the mechanical system when transferred to the electrical domain whereas the impedance analogy does not.

== Applications ==
The impedance analogy is widely used to model the behaviour of [[mechanical filter]]s.  These are filters that are intended for use in an electronic circuit, but work entirely by mechanical vibrational waves.  [[Transducer]]s are provided at the input and output of the filter to convert between the electrical and mechanical domains.&lt;ref&gt;Carr, pp. 170–171&lt;/ref&gt;

Another very common use is in the field of audio equipment, such as loudspeakers.  Loudspeakers consist of a transducer and mechanical moving parts.  Acoustic waves themselves are waves of mechanical motion: of air molecules or some other fluid medium.  A very early application of this type was to make [[mechanical filter#Sound reproduction|significant improvements]] to the abysmal audio performance of [[phonograph]]s.  In 1929 [[Edward Lawry Norton|Edward Norton]] designed the mechanical parts of a phonograph to behave as a maximally flat filter, thus anticipating the electronic [[Butterworth filter]].&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Darlington, p. 7|Harrison}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Elements ==
Before an electrical analogy can be developed for a mechanical system, it must first be described as an abstract [[mechanical network]].  The mechanical system is broken down into a number of ideal elements each of which can then be paired with an electrical analogue.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, pp. 69–70&lt;/ref&gt;  The symbols used for these mechanical elements on network diagrams are shown in the following sections on each individual element.

The mechanical analogies of lumped [[electrical element|electrical elements]] are also [[lumped element model|lumped elements]], that is, it is assumed that the mechanical component possessing the element is small enough  that the time taken by [[mechanical wave|mechanical waves]] to propagate from one end of the component to the other can be neglected.  Analogies can also be developed for [[distributed element model|distributed elements]] such as [[transmission line|transmission lines]] but the greatest benefits are with lumped element circuits.  Mechanical analogies are required for the three passive electrical elements, namely, [[electrical resistance|resistance]], [[inductance]] and [[capacitance]].  What these analogies are is determined by what mechanical property is chosen to represent &lt;nowiki&gt;''effort''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, the analogy of [[voltage]], and the property chosen to represent &lt;nowiki&gt;''flow''&lt;/nowiki&gt;, the analogy of [[electric current|current]].&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;  In the impedance analogy the effort variable is [[force]] and the flow variable is [[velocity]].&lt;ref name=Smith1856&gt;Talbot-Smith, pp. 1.85–1.86&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resistance===
[[File:Impedance analogy resistor.svg|thumb|upright|The mechanical symbol for a damper (left) and its electrical analogy (right).&lt;ref name=Eargle4&gt;Eargle, p. 4&lt;/ref&gt;  The symbol is meant to be evocative of a [[dashpot]].&lt;ref name =Kleiner71/&gt;]]
The mechanical analogy of electrical resistance is the loss of energy of a moving system through such processes as [[friction]].  A mechanical component analogous to a [[resistor]] is a [[shock absorber]] and the property analogous to resistance is [[damping]].  A resistor is governed by the constitutive equation of [[Ohm's law]],

:&lt;math&gt; v = i R &lt;/math&gt;

The analogous equation in the mechanical domain is,

:&lt;math&gt; F = u R_\mathrm m &lt;/math&gt;

:where,
: ''R'' is resistance
: ''v'' is voltage
: ''i'' is current
: ''R''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is mechanical resistance, or damping
: ''F'' is force
: ''u'' is velocity induced by the force.&lt;ref name=Smith1856/&gt;

Electrical resistance represents the [[real part]] of [[electrical impedance]].  Likewise, mechanical resistance is the real part of [[mechanical impedance]].&lt;ref name=Kleiner71&gt;Kleiner, p. 71&lt;/ref&gt;

===Inductance===
[[File:Impedance analogy inductor.svg|thumb|upright|The mechanical symbol for a mass (left) and its electrical analogy (right).&lt;ref name=Eargle4/&gt;  The square angle below the mass is meant to indicate that movement of the mass is relative to a frame of reference.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, p. 74&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The mechanical analogy of inductance in the impedance analogy is [[mass]].  A mechanical component analogous to an [[inductor]] is a large, rigid weight.  An inductor is governed by the constitutive equation,

:&lt;math&gt; v = L \frac{di}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

The analogous equation in the mechanical domain is [[Newton's second law of motion]],

:&lt;math&gt; F = M \frac {du}{dt} &lt;/math&gt;

:where,
: ''L'' is inductance
: ''t'' is time
: ''M'' is mass&lt;ref name=Smith1856/&gt;

The impedance of an inductor is purely [[imaginary number|imaginary]] and is given by,

:&lt;math&gt; Z = j \omega L &lt;/math&gt;

The analogous mechanical impedance is given by,

:&lt;math&gt; Z_\mathrm m = j \omega M &lt;/math&gt;

:where,
: ''Z'' is electrical impedance
: ''j'' is the [[imaginary unit]]
: ''ω'' is [[angular frequency]]
: ''Z''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; is mechanical impedance.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, pp. 73–74&lt;/ref&gt;

===Capacitance===
[[File:Impedance analogy capacitor.svg|thumb|upright|The mechanical symbol for a stiffness element (left) and its electrical analogy (right).&lt;ref name=Eargle4/&gt;  The symbol is meant to be evocative of a spring.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The mechanical analogy of capacitance in the impedance analogy is compliance.  It is more common in mechanics to discuss [[stiffness]], the inverse of compliance.  The analogy of stiffness in the electrical domain is the less commonly used [[elastance]], the inverse of capacitance.&lt;ref&gt;Pipes &amp; Harvill, p. 187&lt;/ref&gt;  A mechanical component analogous to a [[capacitor]] is a [[Spring (device)|spring]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, p. 73&lt;/ref&gt;  A capacitor is governed by the constitutive equation,

:&lt;math&gt; v = D \int i dt &lt;/math&gt;

The analogous equation in the mechanical domain is a form of [[Hooke's law]],

:&lt;math&gt; F = S \int u dt &lt;/math&gt;

:where,
: ''D'' = 1/''C'' is elastance
: ''C'' is capacitance
: ''S'' is stiffness

The impedance of a capacitor is purely imaginary and is given by,

:&lt;math&gt; Z = \frac {D} {j \omega} &lt;/math&gt;

The analogous mechanical impedance is given by,

:&lt;math&gt; Z_\mathrm m = \frac {S} {j \omega} &lt;/math&gt;

Alternatively, one can write,

:&lt;math&gt; Z_\mathrm m = \frac {1} {j \omega C_\mathrm m} &lt;/math&gt;

:where,
: ''C''&lt;sub&gt;m&lt;/sub&gt; = 1/''S'' is mechanical compliance

which is more directly analogous to the electrical expression when capacitance is used.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, pp. 72–73&lt;/ref&gt;

===Resonator===
A mechanical resonator consists of both a mass element and a compliance element.  Mechanical resonators are analogous to electrical [[LC circuit]]s consisting of inductance and capacitance.  Real mechanical components unavoidably have both mass and compliance so it is a practical proposition to make resonators as a single component.  In fact, it is more difficult to make a pure mass or pure compliance as a single component.  A spring can be made with a certain compliance and mass minimised, or a mass can be made with compliance minimised, but neither can be eliminated altogether.  Mechanical resonators are a key component of mechanical filters.&lt;ref&gt;Taylor &amp; Huang, pp. 377–383&lt;/ref&gt;

===Generators===
[[File:Impedance analogy voltage.svg|thumb|upright|The mechanical symbol for a constant force generator (left) and its electrical analogy (right)&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Kleiner, p. 76|Beranek &amp; Mellow, p. 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
[[File:Impedance analogy current.svg|thumb|upright|The mechanical symbol for a constant velocity generator (left) and its electrical analogy (right)&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Kleiner, p. 77|Beranek &amp; Mellow, p. 70}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Analogues exist for the active electrical elements of the [[voltage source]] and the [[current source]] (generators).  The mechanical analogue in the impedance analogy of the constant voltage generator is the constant force generator.  The mechanical analogue of the constant current generator is the constant velocity generator.&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, pp. 76–77&lt;/ref&gt;

An example of a constant force generator is the [[constant-force spring]].  This is analogous to a real voltage source, such as a battery, which remains near constant-voltage with load provided that the load resistance is much higher than the battery internal resistance.  An example of a practical constant velocity generator is a lightly loaded powerful machine, such as a [[Electric motor|motor]], driving a [[belt (mechanical)|belt]].&lt;ref&gt;Kleiner, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Transducers ===
[[Electromechanics|Electromechanical systems]] require [[transducer]]s to convert between the electrical and mechanical domains.  They are analogous to [[two-port network]]s and like those can be described by a pair of simultaneous equations and four arbitrary parameters.  There are numerous possible representations, but the form most applicable to the impedance analogy has the arbitrary parameters in units of impedance.  In matrix form (with the electrical side taken as port 1) this representation is, 

:&lt;math&gt; \begin{bmatrix} v \\ F \end{bmatrix} = \begin{bmatrix} z_{11} &amp; z_{12} \\ z_{21} &amp; z_{22} \end{bmatrix} \begin{bmatrix} i \\ u \end{bmatrix} &lt;/math&gt;

The element &lt;math&gt; z_{22} \,&lt;/math&gt; is the open circuit mechanical impedance, that is, the impedance presented by the mechanical side of the transducer when no current (open circuit) is entering the electrical side. The element &lt;math&gt; z_{11} \,&lt;/math&gt;, conversely, is the clamped electrical impedance, that is, the impedance presented to the electrical side when the mechanical side is clamped and prevented from moving (velocity is zero). The remaining two elements, &lt;math&gt; z_{21} \,&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; z_{12} \,&lt;/math&gt;, describe the transducer forward and reverse transfer functions respectively.  They are both analogous to [[transfer impedance]]s and are hybrid ratios of an electrical and mechanical quantity.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Jackson, pp. 16–17|Paik, p. 572}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Transformers===
The mechanical analogy of a [[transformer]] is a [[simple machine]] such as a [[pulley]] or a [[lever]].  The force applied to the load can be greater or less than the input force depending on whether the [[mechanical advantage]] of the machine is greater or less than unity respectively.  Mechanical advantage is analogous to transformer turns ratio in the impedance analogy.  A mechanical advantage greater than unity is analogous to a step-up transformer and less than unity is analogous to a step-down transformer.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Kleiner, pp. 74–76|Beranek &amp; Mellow, pp. 76–77}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Examples ==
===Simple resonant circuit===
[[File:Impedance analogy resonator.svg|thumb|upright=3|center|Simple mechanical resonator (left) and its impedance analogy equivalent circuit (right)]]
The figure shows a mechanical arrangement of a platform of mass ''M'' that is suspended above the substrate by a spring of stiffness ''S'' and a damper of resistance ''R''.  The impedance analogy equivalent circuit is shown to the right of this arrangement and consists of a [[RLC circuit|series resonant circuit]].  This system has a [[resonant frequency]], and may have a [[natural frequency]] of oscillation if not too heavily damped.&lt;ref&gt;Eargle, pp. 3–4&lt;/ref&gt;

===Model of the human ear===
[[File:Impedance analogy human ear.svg|thumb|left|upright=4|One equivalent circuit of the human ear using the impedance analogy]]
{{clear}}
[[File:Anatomy of the Human Ear en.svg|thumb|Anatomy of the ear]]
The circuit diagram shows an impedance analogy model of the [[human ear]].  The [[ear canal]] section is followed by a transformer representing the [[eardrum]].  The eardrum is the transducer between the acoustic waves in air in the ear canal and the mechanical vibrations in the bones of the middle ear.  At the [[cochlea]] there is another change of medium from mechanical vibrations to the fluid filling the cochlea.  This example thus demonstrates the power of electrical analogies in bringing together three domains (acoustic, mechanical and fluid flow) into a single unified whole. If the nerve impulses flowing to the brain had also been included in the model then the electrical domain would have made four domains encompassed in the model.

The cochlea portion of the circuit uses a [[finite element analysis]] of the continuous [[transmission line]] of the cochlear duct.  An ideal representation of such a structure would use [[infinitesimal]] elements, and there would thus be an infinite number of them.  In this model the cochlea is divided into 350 sections and each section is modelled using a small number of lumped elements.&lt;ref&gt;Fukazawa &amp; Tanaka, pp. 191–192&lt;/ref&gt;

==Advantages and disadvantages==
The principal advantage of the impedance analogy over its alternative, the [[mobility analogy]], is that it maintains the analogy between electrical and mechanical impedance.  That is, a mechanical impedance is represented as an electrical impedance and a mechanical resistance is represented as an electrical resistance in the electrical equivalent circuit.  It is also natural to think of force as analogous to voltage ([[Generator (circuit theory)|generator]] voltages are often called [[electromotive force]]) and velocity as analogous to current.  It is this basic analogy that leads to the analogy between electrical and mechanical impedance.&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt;

The principal disadvantage of the impedance analogy is that it does not preserve the topology of the mechanical system.  Elements that are in series in the mechanical system are in parallel in the electrical equivalent circuit and vice versa.&lt;ref&gt;{{multiref|Busch-Vishniac, pp. 20–21|Eargle, pp. 4–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The impedance matrix representation of a transducer transforms force in the mechanical domain into current in the electrical domain.  Likewise, velocity in the mechanical domain is transformed into voltage in the electrical domain.  A two-port device that transforms a voltage into an analogous quantity can be represented as a simple [[transformer]].  A device that transforms a voltage into an analogue of the dual property of voltage (that is, current, whose analogue is velocity) is represented as a [[gyrator]].&lt;ref&gt;Beranek &amp; Mellow, pp. 70–71&lt;/ref&gt;  Since force is analogous to voltage, not current, this may seem like a disadvantage on the face of it.  However, many practical transducers, especially at [[Audio frequency|audio frequencies]], work by [[electromagnetic induction]] and are governed by just such a relationship.&lt;ref&gt;Eargle, pp. 5–7&lt;/ref&gt;  For instance, the [[Lorentz force#Force on a current-carrying wire|force on a current-carrying conductor]] is given by,

:&lt;math&gt; F = BIl &lt;/math&gt;

:where,
: ''B'' is magnetic flux density
: ''l'' is length of the conductor

== History ==
The impedance analogy is sometimes called the Maxwell analogy&lt;ref&gt;Busch-Vishniac, p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; after [[James Clerk Maxwell]] (1831–1879) who used mechanical analogies to explain his ideas of electromagnetic fields.&lt;ref&gt;Stephens &amp; Bate, p. 421&lt;/ref&gt;  However, the term ''impedance'' was not coined until 1886 (by [[Oliver Heaviside]]),&lt;ref&gt;Martinsen &amp; Grimnes, p. 287&lt;/ref&gt; the idea of [[complex impedance]] was introduced by [[Arthur E. Kennelly]] in 1893, and the concept of impedance was not extended into the mechanical domain until 1920 by Kennelly and [[Arthur Gordon Webster]].&lt;ref&gt;Hunt p. 66&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Henri Poincaré]] in 1907 was the first to describe a transducer as a pair of [[linear algebra]]ic equations relating electrical variables (voltage and current) to mechanical variables (force and velocity).&lt;ref&gt;Pierce, p. 200, cites Poincaré&lt;/ref&gt;  Wegel, in 1921, was the first to express these equations in terms of mechanical impedance as well as electrical impedance.&lt;ref&gt;{{Multiref|Hunt, p. 66|Pierce, p. 200, cites Wegel}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:James Mark Baldwin 1917.jpg|thumb|James Mark Baldwin in 1917]]
'''James Mark Baldwin ''' (January 12, 1861, [[Columbia, South Carolina]] – November 8, 1934, [[Paris]])&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.distantcousin.com/cemetery/nj/mercer/princetoncem/b.html Archive of Genealogical Data]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.distantcousin.com/cemetery/nj/mercer/princetoncem/_Photo.asp?Photo=790 Princeton Cemetery Gravemarker]&lt;/ref&gt; was an [[Americans|American]] [[philosophy|philosopher]] and [[psychology|psychologist]] who was educated at [[Princeton University|Princeton]] under the supervision of Scottish philosopher [[James McCosh]] and who was one of the founders of the [[Princeton University Department of Psychology|Department of Psychology]] at the university. He made important contributions to early [[psychology]], [[psychiatry]], and to the theory of [[evolution]].

==Biography==

===Early life===
Baldwin was born and raised in Columbia, South Carolina. His father, who was from Connecticut, was an [[abolitionist]] and was known to purchase slaves in order to free them. During the [[American Civil War|Civil War]] his father moved north, but the family remained in their home until the time of [[Sherman's March]]. Upon their return after the war, Baldwin's father was part of the [[Reconstruction Era]] government. Baldwin was sent north to receive his secondary education in New Jersey. As a result, he chose to attend the College of New Jersey (now [[Princeton University]]).

Baldwin started in theology under the tutelage of the college's president, [[James McCosh]], but soon switched to philosophy. He was awarded the Green Fellowship in Mental Science (named after his future father-in-law, the head of the [[Princeton Theological Seminary]]) and used it to study in Germany with [[Wilhelm Wundt]] at Leipzig and with [[Friedrich Paulsen]] at Berlin (1884–1934).

In 1885 he became Instructor in French and German at the [[Princeton Theological Seminary]]. He translated [[Théodule-Armand Ribot]]'s ''German Psychology of Today'' and wrote his first paper "The Postulates of a Physiological Psychology". Ribot's work traced the origins of psychology from [[Immanuel Kant]] through [[Johann Friedrich Herbart]], [[Gustav Theodor Fechner]], [[Hermann Lotze]] to Wundt.

In 1887, while working as a professor of philosophy at [[Lake Forest College]] he married Helen Hayes Green, the daughter of the President of the Seminary, [[William Henry Green]]. At Lake Forest he published the first part of his ''Handbook of Psychology (Senses and Intellect)'' in which he directed attention to the new experimental psychology of [[Ernst Heinrich Weber]], Fechner and Wundt.

In 1889 he went to the [[University of Toronto]] as the Chair of Logic and Metaphysics. His creation of a laboratory of experimental psychology at Toronto (which he claimed was the first in the [[British Empire]]) coincided with the birth of his daughters Helen (1889) and Elizabeth (1891) which inspired the quantitative and experimental research on [[infant development]] that was to make such a vivid impression on [[Jean Piaget]] and [[Lawrence Kohlberg]] through Baldwin's ''Mental Development in the Child and the Race: Methods and Processes'' (1894) dedicated to the subject.
A second part of ''Handbook of Psychology (Feeling and Will)'' appeared in 1891.

During this creative phase Baldwin traveled to France (1892) to visit the important psychologists [[Jean-Martin Charcot|Charcot]] (at the [[Pitié-Salpêtrière Hospital|Salpêtrière]]), [[Hippolyte Bernheim]] (at Nancy), and [[Pierre Janet]].

===Mid-career===
In 1893 he was called back to his alma mater, [[Princeton University]], where he was offered the Stuart Chair in Psychology and the opportunity to establish a new psychology laboratory. He would stay at Princeton until 1903 working out the highlights of his career reflected in ''Social and Ethical Interpretations in Mental Development: A Study in Social Psychology'' (1897) where he took his previous ''Mental Development'' to the critical stage in which it survived in the work of [[Lev Vygotsky]], through Vygotsky in the crucial work of [[Alexander Luria]], and in the synthesis of both by [[Aleksey Leontyev]]. He also edited the English editions of [[Karl Groos]]'s ''Play of Animals'' (1898) and ''Play of Men'' (1901).

It was during this time that Baldwin wrote "A New Factor of Evolution" (June 1896/''The American Naturalist'') which later became known as the "[[Baldwin Effect]]". But other important contributors should not be overlooked. [[Conwy Lloyd Morgan]] was perhaps closest to understanding the so-called "Baldwin Effect". In his ''Habit and Instinct'' (1896) he phrased a comparable version of the theory, as he did in an address to a session of the [[New York Academy of Sciences]] (February 1896) in the presence of Baldwin. (1896/"Of modification and variation".'' Science'' 4(99) (November 20):733-739). As did [[Henry Fairfield Osborn]] (1896/"A mode of evolution requiring neither natural selection nor the inheritance of acquired characteristics". ''Transactions of the New York Academy of Science'' 15:141-148). The "Baldwin Effect", building in part on the principle of "organic selection" proposed by Baldwin in "Mental Development" did only receive its name from [[George Gaylord Simpson]] in 1953. (in: ''Evolution'' 7:110-117) (see: David J. Depew in "Evolution and Learning" M.I.T. 2003)

Baldwin complemented his psychological work with philosophy, in particular [[epistemology]] his contribution to which he presented in the presidential address to the American Psychological Association in 1897. By then the work on the ''Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology'' (1902) had been announced and a period of intense philosophical correspondence ensued with the contributors to the project: [[William James]], [[John Dewey]], [[Charles Sanders Peirce]], [[Josiah Royce]], [[George Edward Moore]], [[Bernard Bosanquet (philosopher)|Bernard Bosanquet]], [[James McKeen Cattell]], [[Edward B. Titchener]], [[Hugo Münsterberg]], [[Christine Ladd-Franklin]], [[Adolf Meyer (psychiatrist)|Adolf Meyer]], [[George Stout]], [[Franklin Henry Giddings]], [[Edward Bagnall Poulton]] and others.

In 1899 Baldwin went to Oxford to supervise the completion of the ''Dictionary''... (1902). He was awarded an Honorary Doctorate in Science at [[Oxford University]]. (In the light of the foregoing, the deafening silence with which J. M. Baldwin was later treated in Oxford publications on the mind may well come to be regarded as one of the significant omissions in the history of ideas for the 20th century. Compare for example [[Richard Gregory]]: ''The Oxford Companion to the Mind'', first edition, 1987.)

===Later life===
In 1903, partly as a result of a dispute with Princeton president [[Woodrow Wilson]] and in part due to an offer involving more pay and less teaching, he moved to a professorship of philosophy and psychology at [[Johns Hopkins University]]. Here, he re-opened the experimental laboratory that had been founded by [[G. Stanley Hall]] in 1884 (but had closed with Hall's departure to take over the presidency of [[Clark University]] in 1888).

In Baltimore Baldwin started to work on ''Thoughts and Things: A Study of the Development and Meaning of Thought, Or Genetic Logic'' (1906), a densely integrative rendering of his ideas culminating in ''Genetic Theory of Reality: Being the Outcome of Genetic Logic as Issuing in the Aesthetic Theory of Reality called Pancalism'' (1915). This book introduced the concept that knowledge grows through childhood in a series of distinct stages that involve interaction between innate abilities and environmental feedback. He further stated that the initial physical development gives way to language and cognitive abilities such that the child emerges as a result of social and physical growth.

In Baltimore also Baldwin was arrested in a raid on a "colored" brothel (1908), a scandal that put an end to his American career. Forced to leave Johns Hopkins he looked for residence in Paris. He was to reside in France till his death in 1934.&lt;ref&gt;Hothersall, 2004&lt;/ref&gt;

His first years (1908–1912) in France were interrupted by long stays in [[Mexico]] where he advised on university matters and lectured at the School of Higher Studies at the National University in [[Mexico City]]. His ''Darwin and the Humanities'' (1909) and ''Individual and Society'' (1911) date from this period.
In 1912 he took permanent residence in Paris.

Baldwin's residence in France resulted in his pointing out the urgency of American non-neutral support for his new hosts on the French battlefields of [[World War&amp;nbsp;I]]. He published ''American Neutrality, Its Cause and Cure'' (1916) for the purpose, and when in 1916 he survived a German torpedo attack on the {{ship|SS|Sussex||2}} in the [[English Channel]]&amp;nbsp;– on the return trip from a visit to [[William Osler]] at Oxford&amp;nbsp;– his open telegram to the President of the United States on the affair became frontpage news (''New York Times''). With the entry of America in the war (1917) he helped to organize the Paris branch of the American Navy League, acting as its Chairman till 1922. In 1926 his memoirs ''Between Two Wars (1861-1921)'' were published. He died in Paris on November 8, 1934.

==Ideas==
Baldwin was prominent among early experimental psychologists and was voted by his peers as the fifth most important psychologist in America in a 1903 survey conducted by [[James McKeen Cattell]],&lt;ref&gt;Cattell, J. M. (1933). American Men of Science. New York: Science Press, pp.1277-1278.&lt;/ref&gt; but it was his contributions to [[developmental psychology]] that were the most important. His stepwise theory of cognitive development was a major influence on the later, and much more widely known, developmental theory of [[Jean Piaget]]. Equally important is his contribution to the development of what is currently known as Theory of Mind (ToM).&lt;ref&gt;Obiols JE and Berrios GE (2009): The historical roots of Theory of Mind: the work of James Mark Baldwin ''History of Psychiatry'', 20(3): 377-392&lt;/ref&gt; His ideas on the relationship of Ego and Alter were developed by [[Pierre Janet]];&lt;ref&gt;Henri Ellenberger, ''The Discovery of the Unconscious'' (1970), p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; while his stress on how "My sense of self grows by imitation of you...an imitative creation"&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Ellenberger, p. 404&lt;/ref&gt; contributed to the [[mirror stage]] of [[Jacques Lacan]].&lt;ref&gt;Jacques Lacan, ''Écrits'' (1997), p. 1&lt;/ref&gt;

His contributions to the young discipline's early journals and institutions were highly significant as well. Baldwin was a co-founder (with [[James McKeen Cattell]]) of ''[[Psychological Review]]'' (which was founded explicitly to compete with [[G. Stanley Hall]]'s ''[[American Journal of Psychology]]''), ''[[Psychological Monographs]]'' and ''[[Psychological Index]].'' He was also the founding editor of ''[[Psychological Bulletin]]''.

In 1892 he was vice-president of the [[International Congress of Psychology]] held in [[London]], and in 1897–1898 president of the [[American Psychological Association]]; he received a gold medal from the [[Royal Academy of Arts and Sciences of Denmark]] (1897), and was honorary president of the [[International Congress of Criminal Anthropology]] held in [[Geneva]] in 1896.

===Organic selection===
The idea of organic selection came from the interpretation of the observable data in Baldwin's experimental study of infant reaching and its role in [[Developmental disorder|mental development]]. Every practice of the infant's movement intended to advance the integration of [[behavior]] favorable to development in the experimental framework appeared to be selected from an excess of movement in the trial of imitation.

In further stages of development&amp;nbsp;– the ones most critical to an understanding of the evolution of mind&amp;nbsp;– this was graphically illustrated in the child's efforts to draw and learning to write. (''Mental Development in the Child and the Race'')

In later editions of ''Mental Development'' Baldwin changed  the term "''organic'' selection" into "''functional'' selection".

So, from the outset the idea was well linked to the [[philosophy of mind]] Baldwin was emancipating from the models inspired by divine pre-establishment. ([[Spinoza]]) (Wozniak, 2001)

It is the communication of this insight into the practice-related nature of dynamogenic development, above all its integration as a creative factor in the fabric of society, that helped the students of Baldwin to understand what was left of [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck|Lamarck's]] signature. Singularly illustrated by [[Gregory Bateson]] in ''Mind and Nature'' (1979) and reintegrated in contemporary studies by [[Terrence Deacon]] (''[[The Symbolic Species]]: The [[co-evolution]] of [[language]] and the [[human brain]]'', 1997) and other scholars of [[biosemiotics]].

In the [[human species]] the faculty of niche building is favored by a practical intelligence able to design the circumstances that will put its vital acquirements out of harm's way in terms of (linearly predicted) [[natural selection]]. It is precisely in the fields of study relating to massive [[selection pressure]]s against which other species seem to be without defenses&amp;nbsp;– biological development in the face of novel [[pandemic]]s ([[AIDS]], [[mad cow disease]])&amp;nbsp;– that the arguments relative to the natural [[heredity]] of intelligent acquirements have resurfaced in a way most challenging to science.

===Baldwin effect===
{{Main|Baldwin effect}}
Baldwin's most important theoretical legacy is the concept of the [[Baldwin effect]] or "Baldwinian evolution". Baldwin proposed, against the [[Lamarckism|neo-Lamarckian]]s of his day (most notably [[Edward Drinker Cope]]), that there is a mechanism whereby [[epigenetic]] factors come to shape the congenital endowment as much as&amp;nbsp;– or more than&amp;nbsp;– [[natural selection]] pressures.  In particular, human behavioral decisions made and sustained across generations as a set of [[culture|cultural]] practices ought to be considered among the factors shaping the human genome.

For example, the [[incest taboo]], if powerfully enforced, removes the natural [[natural selection|selection pressure]] against the possession of incest-favoring instincts. After a few generations without this natural selection pressure, unless such genetic material were profoundly fixed, it would tend to diversify and lose its function. Humans would no longer be innately averse to incest, but would rely on their capacity to internalize such rules from cultural practices.

The opposite case can also be true: cultural practice might [[Artificial selection|selectively breed]] humans to meet the fitness conditions of new environments, cultural and physical, which earlier hominids could not have survived. Baldwinian evolution might strengthen or weaken a genetic trait.

==Influence==
Baldwin's contribution to this field places him at the heart of contemporary controversies in the fields of [[evolutionary psychology]] and wider [[sociobiology]]. Few people did more than Robert Wozniak, Professor of Psychology at [[Bryn Mawr College]], for the rediscovery of the significance of James Mark Baldwin in the [[history of ideas]].

==Work==
Apart from articles in the ''[[Psychological Review]]'', Baldwin wrote:
*''Handbook of Psychology'' (1890), translation of Ribot’s ''German Psychology of To-day'' (1886);
*''Elements of Psychology'' (1893);
*''Social and Ethical Interpretations in Mental Development'' (1898);
*''Story of the Mind'' (1898);
*''Mental Development in the Child and the Race'' (1896);
*''Thought and Things'' ([[London]] and [[New York City|New York]], 1906).

He also largely contributed to the ''[[Dictionary of Philosophy and Psychology]]'' (1901–1905), of which he was [[editing|editor]] in-chief.

'''Just war theory''' ([[Latin]]: ''jus bellum justum'') is a [[doctrine]], also referred to as a [[tradition]], of [[Ethics#Applied ethics|military ethics]] studied by military leaders, [[theologian]]s, [[ethicist]]s and [[policy maker]]s. The purpose of the doctrine is to ensure war is morally justifiable through a series of [[Just war theory#Criteria of just war theory|criteria]], all of which must be met for a war to be considered just. The criteria are split into two groups:  [[Just war theory#Jus ad bellum|"right to go to war" (''jus ad bellum'')]] and [[Just war theory#Jus in bello|"right conduct in war" (''jus in bello'')]]. The first concerns the morality of going to war, and the second the moral conduct within war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Guthrie |first1=Charles |last2=Quinlan |first2=Michael |year=2007 |title= Just War: The Just War Tradition: Ethics in Modern Warfare  |isbn= 978-0747595571 |pages=11–15 |chapter=III: The Structure of the Tradition }}&lt;/ref&gt; Recently there have been calls for the inclusion of a third category of just war theory—''[[jus post bellum]]''—dealing with the morality of post-war settlement and reconstruction.

Just war theory postulates that war, while terrible, is not always the worst option. Important responsibilities, undesirable outcomes, or preventable atrocities may justify war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last1=Guthrie |first1=Charles |last2=Quinlan |first2=Michael |date=26 Sep 2007 |title=Just War: The Just War Tradition: Ethics in Modern Warfare |location=United Kingdom |publisher=Bloomsbury Publishing PLC |isbn=978-0747595571 |pages=11–15 |chapter=III: The Structure of the Tradition}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Opponents of just war theory may be either inclined to a stricter [[Pacifism|pacifist]] standard (proposing that there has never been and/or can never be a justifiable basis for war)&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/win2014/entries/pacifism/|title=Pacifism|last=Fiala|first=Andrew|date=2014-12-21|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|isbn=|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Winter 2014|location=|pages=|quote=Philosophical discussions of pacifism have clarified the concept by distinguishing the more general commitment to nonviolence from a narrower anti-war position. Pacifism is further defined through its dialectical relation to the idea of justified violence that is found in the Western just war tradition, with many locating pacifism on a continuum for assessing the morality of war that includes realism, just war theory, and pacifism. Indeed, there is an ongoing debate about the proper relation between just war theory and pacifism that focuses on the question of whether the just war theory begins with a pacifist presumption against war. Some authors (May, for example) have used the just war theory to derive a version of pacifism described as "contingent pacifism" or "just war pacifism".}}&lt;/ref&gt; or toward a more permissive [[Nationalism|nationalist]] standard (proposing that a war need only serve a nation's interests to be justifiable).&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://plato.stanford.edu/archives/spr2016/entries/schmitt/|title=Carl Schmitt|last=Vinx|first=Lars|date=2016-03-21|work=The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy|publisher=Metaphysics Research Lab, Stanford University|isbn=|editor-last=Zalta|editor-first=Edward N.|edition=Spring 2016|location=|pages=|quote=The main pillar of the ''ius publicum Europaeum'', according to Schmitt, was a strict separation between the ''ius ad bellum'' and the ''ius in bello''. On the level of ''ius ad bellum'', all independent states were recognized to possess the right to go to war on the basis of their own judgment of justice and necessity. The legal order of ''ius publicum Europaeum'', in effect, did not distinguish between just and unjust war. Rather, both sides in a conflict between sovereign states were by default recognized as legitimate belligerents (NE 140–71). Moreover, since both states in any conflict were held to be legitimate belligerents, states not directly involved in a conflict were taken to possess the right to choose to back either side or to remain neutral (DCW 53–74). This framework, Schmitt argues, allowed European states to bring about a highly effective containment of the negative consequences of war, and thus of the dangers of political existence. The abstraction from the justice of war allowed states to make peace without being hampered by the need to apportion moral blame. The freedom to side with either party in a conflict, or else to remain neutral, allowed states to contain conflicts by balancing or simply by staying out of the fight. Most importantly, however, the mutual recognition of legitimate belligerency allowed for the effective enforcement of stringent constraints on the permissible means of warfare on the level of ''ius in bello''. Inter-statal warfare during the period of the ''jus publicum Europaeum'', according to Schmitt, distinguished carefully between combatants and civilians and abstained from using methods of warfare that might endanger the lives or the property of civilians (NE 142–43, 165–8).  This containment of war, Schmitt claims, was premised on the willingness to bracket the question of justice on the level of ''ius ad bellum''. Once one takes the view that a war can be legitimate on one side, while being illegitimate on the other, one is forced to conclude, Schmitt argues, that it is morally wrong to grant the status of legitimate belligerency to those who are judged to fight without a just cause, and equally wrong to assume that they ought to enjoy the same ''in bello''-rights as those who fight justly (NE 320-2; CP 54–7). Moreover, once one separates between legitimate and illegitimate belligerency, it will no longer be possible to argue that other states have the right to side with either belligerent or to remain neutral. Rather, third parties will be seen to have a duty to side with those who fight justly (DK 26–53). The abandonment of the idea that all participants in a war among states are equally legitimate belligerents, Schmitt concludes, inevitably undercuts the containment of war achieved in ''ius publicum Europaeum'' (PB 286–90). Unsurprisingly, Schmitt rejected the project of creating an international legal order based on a 'discriminating concept of war' that would subject the use of force on the part of sovereign states to substantive criteria of moral legitimacy and external legal control. He regarded such developments as little more than attempts on the part of the victorious western allies to brand any violent German effort to revise the outcomes of WWI as illegal and thus as unjust, and to give themselves license for the application of means of coercion and for the use of methods of warfare that would have been considered as illegitimate in the context of mutually legitimate belligerency (PB 184–203; NE 259–80). Schmitt argued that international legalization on the model of just war theory would not prevent coming wars. It would merely make them more total, as it would encourage opponents to regard each other as absolute enemies worthy of elimination (NE 309–22; Brown 2007; Slomp 2009, 95–111).}}&lt;/ref&gt; In a large number of cases, philosophers state that individuals need not be of guilty conscience if required to fight.

The historical aspect, or the "just war tradition", deals with the historical body of rules or agreements that have applied in various wars across the ages. The just war tradition also considers the writings of various philosophers and lawyers through history, and examines both their philosophical visions of war's ethical limits and whether their thoughts have contributed to the body of conventions that have evolved to guide war and warfare.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.iep.utm.edu/justwar/|title=Just War Theory {{!}} Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy|website=www.iep.utm.edu|access-date=2016-10-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==

===Pre-Christian===
The Indian [[Hindu]] epic, the [[Mahabharata]], offers one of the first written discussions of a "just war" (''[[dharma-yuddha]]'' or "righteous war"). In it, one of five ruling brothers asks if the suffering caused by war can ever be justified, and then a long discussion ensues between the siblings, establishing criteria like ''proportionality'' (chariots cannot attack cavalry, only other chariots; no attacking people in distress), ''just means'' (no poisoned or barbed arrows), ''just cause'' (no attacking out of rage), and fair treatment of captives and the wounded.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UwjC1peqwx0C&amp;pg=PA117&amp;lpg=PA117&amp;dq=mahabharata+%22just+war%22+-wikipedia&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=k1RhVg8MSB&amp;sig=rLWi6PjpH7L716_kZ4LrPoMROhs&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=55VGT8PiAtLogQeh-N2jDg&amp;ved=0CCkQ6AEwAQ#v=onepage&amp;q=mahabharata%20%22just%20war%22%20-wikipedia&amp;f=false|title=Just War in Comparative Perspective|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The war in the Mahabharata is preceded by context that develops the "just cause" for the war including last minute efforts to reconcile differences to avoid war. At the beginning of the war, there is the discussion of "just conduct" appropriate to the context of war.

A 2017 study found that the just war tradition can be traced as far back as to Ancient Egypt, "demonstrating that just war thought developed beyond the boundaries of Europe and existed many centuries earlier than the advent of Christianity or even the emergence of Greco-Roman doctrine."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Cox|first=Rory|title=Expanding the History of the Just War: The Ethics of War in Ancient Egypt|url=https://academic.oup.com/isq/article-abstract/doi/10.1093/isq/sqx009/3865376/Expanding-the-History-of-the-Just-War-The-Ethics|journal=International Studies Quarterly|volume=61|issue=2|page=371|doi=10.1093/isq/sqx009|year=2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[ancient Rome]], a "just cause" for war might include the necessity of repelling an invasion, or retaliation for pillaging or a breach of treaty.&lt;ref&gt;Livy 9.1.10; [[Cicero]], ''[[Divinatio in Caecilium]]'' 63; ''De provinciis consularibus'' 4; ''Ad Atticum'' VII 14, 3; IX 19, 1; ''Pro rege Deiotauro'' 13; ''[[De officiis]]'' I 36; ''Philippicae'' XI 37; XIII 35; ''De re publica'' II 31; III 35; [[Isidore of Seville]], ''Origines'' XVIII 1, 2; [[Modestinus]], ''Libro I regolarum'' = ''[[Corpus Juris Civilis|Digesta]]'' I 3, 40; [[E. Badian]], ''Roman Imperialism in the Late Republic'' (Ithaca 1968, 2nd ed.), p.11.&lt;/ref&gt; War was always potentially ''[[nefas]]'' ("wrong, forbidden"), and risked [[Religion in ancient Rome|religious pollution and divine disfavor]].&lt;ref&gt;[[William Warde Fowler]], ''The Roman Festivals of the Period of the Republic'' (London 1925), pp. 33ff.; M. Kaser, ''Das altroemische Ius'' (Goettingen 1949), pp. 22ff; P. Catalano, ''Linee del sistema sovrannazionale romano'' (Torino 1965), pp. 14ff.; W. V. Harris, ''War and imperialism in Republican Rome, 327-70 B.C.'' (Oxford 1979), pp. 161 ff.&lt;/ref&gt; A "just war" (''bellum iustum'') thus required a ritualized [[declaration of war|declaration]] by the [[fetial|fetial priests]].&lt;ref&gt;[[Livy]] 1.32; 31.8.3; 36.3.9&lt;/ref&gt; More broadly, conventions of war and treaty-making were part of the ''[[ius gentium]]'', the "law of nations", the customary moral obligations regarded as innate and universal to human beings.&lt;ref&gt;Cicero, ''De officiis'' 3.17.69; Marcia L. Colish, ''The Stoic Tradition from Antiquity to the Early Middle Ages'' (Brill, 1980), p. 150.&lt;/ref&gt; The quintessential explanation of Just War theory in the ancient world is found in [[Cicero]]'s ''[[De Officiis]]'', Book 1, sections 1.11.33–1.13.41. Although, it is well known that [[Julius Caesar]] did not often follow these necessities.   

Christian theory of the Just War begins with [[Augustine of Hippo]]&lt;ref&gt;[http://olympia.anglican.org/churches/B/stdunstan/Beliefs/Christians_War/Christians_War_2.htm Christians and War: Augustine of Hippo and the "Just War theory"] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061128152303/http://olympia.anglican.org/churches/B/stdunstan/Beliefs/Christians_War/Christians_War_2.htm |date=November 28, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Thomas Aquinas]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://olympia.anglican.org/churches/B/stdunstan/Beliefs/Christians_War/Christians_War_3.htm Christians and War: Thomas Aquinas refines the "Just War" Theory] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20060710024929/http://olympia.anglican.org/churches/B/stdunstan/Beliefs/Christians_War/Christians_War_3.htm |date=July 10, 2006 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saint Augustine===
[[Augustine of Hippo]] claimed that, while individuals should not resort immediately to violence, God has given the sword to government for good reason (based upon [https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Romans+13%3A4 Romans 13:4]). In ''Contra Faustum Manichaeum'' book 22 sections 69–76, Augustine argues that Christians, as part of a government, need not be ashamed of protecting peace and punishing wickedness when forced to do so by a government. Augustine asserted that this was a personal, philosophical stance: "What is here required is not a bodily action, but an inward disposition. The sacred seat of virtue is the heart."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2001/septemberweb-only/9-17-55.0.html|title=A Time For War?|author=Robert L. Holmes|work=ChristianityToday.com|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nonetheless, he asserted, peacefulness in the face of a grave wrong that could only be stopped by violence would be a sin. Defense of one's self or others could be a necessity, especially when authorized by a legitimate authority:&lt;blockquote&gt;They who have waged war in obedience to the divine command, or in conformity with His laws, have represented in their persons the public justice or the wisdom of government, and in this capacity have put to death wicked men; such persons have by no means violated the commandment, "Thou shalt not kill."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=AugCity.xml&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=all |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725190746/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=AugCity.xml&amp;images=images%2Fmodeng&amp;data=%2Ftexts%2Fenglish%2Fmodeng%2Fparsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=all |title=City of God |archivedate=25 July 2013 |publisher= |accessdate=25 April 2015 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;While not breaking down the conditions necessary for war to be just, Augustine nonetheless originated the very phrase itself in his work [[City of God (book)|''The City of God'']]:&lt;blockquote&gt;But, say they, the wise man will wage Just Wars. As if he would not all the rather lament the necessity of just wars, if he remembers that he is a man; for if they were not just he would not wage them, and would therefore be delivered from all wars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=AugCity.xml&amp;images=images/modeng&amp;data=/texts/english/modeng/parsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=all |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130725190746/http://etext.lib.virginia.edu/etcbin/toccer-new2?id=AugCity.xml&amp;images=images%2Fmodeng&amp;data=%2Ftexts%2Fenglish%2Fmodeng%2Fparsed&amp;tag=public&amp;part=all |title=City of God |archivedate=25 July 2013 |publisher= |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;J. Mark Mattox writes that, for the individual Christian under the rule of a government engaged in an immoral war, Augustine admonished that Christians, "by divine edict, have no choice but to subject themselves to their political masters and [should] seek to ensure that they execute their war-fighting duty as justly as possible."&lt;ref name="augustine_war_and_peace_just_war"&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/aug-poso/#SH3c Augustine: Political and Social Philosophy], §3-c "War and Peace – The Just War"&lt;/ref&gt;

===Saint Thomas Aquinas===
Nine hundred years later, [[Thomas Aquinas]] (1225–1274) laid out the conditions under which a war could be justified (combining the theological principles of faith with the philosophical principles of reason, he ranked among the most influential thinkers of medieval Scholasticism):&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/politics/pg0029.html|title=Catholic Education Resource Center|author=Super User|work=Catholic Education Resource Center|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* First, just war must be waged by a properly instituted authority such as the state. (Proper Authority is first: represents the common good: which is peace for the sake of man's true end—God.)
* Second, war must occur for a good and just purpose rather than for self-gain (for example, "in the nation's interest" is not just) or as an exercise of power (just cause: for the sake of restoring some good that has been denied. i.e. lost territory, lost goods, punishment for an evil perpetrated by a government, army, or even the civilian populace).
* Third, peace must be a central motive even in the midst of violence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Story of Christianity|author=Justo L. Gonzalez|year=1984|publisher=HarperSanFrancisco}}&lt;/ref&gt; (right intention: an authority must fight for the just reasons it has expressly claimed for declaring war in the first place. Soldiers must also fight for this intention).&lt;ref&gt;The greatest work of Thomas was the Summa, and it is the fullest presentation of his views. The Summa consists of three parts. Part I treats of God, who is the "first cause, himself uncaused" (primum movens immobile) and as such existent only in act (actu), that is pure actuality without potentiality and, therefore, without corporeality. The second part of the Summa (consisting of two parts, namely, prima secundae and secundae, secunda) follows this complex of ideas. Its theme is man's striving after the highest end, which is the blessedness of the visio beata. Here Thomas develops his system of ethics, which has its root in Aristotle. The way which leads to God is Christ: and Christ is the theme of part III. It can not be asserted that the incarnation was absolutely necessary, "since God in his omnipotent power could have repaired human nature in many other ways": but it was the most suitable way both for the purpose of instruction and of satisfaction.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the Summa Theologica, Thomas proceeded to distinguish between philosophy and theology, and between reason and revelation, though he emphasized that these did not contradict each other. Both are fountains of knowledge; both come from God.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.christianitytoday.com/history/people/theologians/thomas-aquinas.html|title=Thomas Aquinas|newspaper=Christian History {{!}} Learn the History of Christianity &amp; the Church|access-date=2016-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===School of Salamanca===
{{Unreferenced section|date=February 2015}}

The [[School of Salamanca]] expanded on Thomistic understanding of [[natural law]] and just war. It stated that war is one of the worst evils suffered by mankind. The School's adherents reasoned that war should be a last resort, and only then, when necessary to prevent an even greater evil. Diplomatic resolution is always preferable, even for the more powerful party, before a war is started.&lt;!-- the point being that obviously the weaker party would be happier with a diplomatic solution, while the stronger might need a bit more encouragement to accept a diplomatic solution --&gt; Examples of "just war" are:
* In self-defense, as long as there is a reasonable possibility of success.
* Preventive war against a [[tyranny|tyrant]] who is about to attack.
* War to punish a guilty enemy.

A war is not legitimate or illegitimate simply based on its original motivation: it must comply with a series of additional requirements:
* It is necessary that the response be commensurate with the evil; use of more violence than is strictly necessary would constitute an unjust war.
* Governing authorities ''declare'' war, but their decision is not sufficient cause to begin a war. If the ''people'' oppose a war, then it is illegitimate. The people have a right to depose a government that is waging, or is about to wage, an unjust war.
* Once war has begun, there remain moral limits to action. For example, one may not attack innocents or kill hostages.
* It is obligatory to take advantage of all options for dialogue and negotiations before undertaking a war; war is only legitimate as a last resort.

Under this doctrine expansionist wars, wars of pillage, wars to convert [[infidel]]s or [[paganism|pagans]], and wars for glory are all inherently unjust.

===Doctrine===

The just war doctrine of the [[Catholic Church]]—sometimes mistaken as the "just war theory"&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1915&amp;dat=19821127&amp;id=1AMhAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=ZnUFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=3341,5161448|title=The Day|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19990410&amp;id=W_AvAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=7fwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5943,5499714|title=Lakeland Ledger|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;—found in the 1992 ''[[Catechism of the Catholic Church]]'', in paragraph 2309, lists four strict conditions for "legitimate defense by military force":&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.scborromeo.org/ccc/para/2309.htm|title=|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* the damage inflicted by the aggressor on the nation or community of nations must be lasting, grave, and certain;
* all other means of putting an end to it must have been shown to be impractical or ineffective;
* there must be serious prospects of success;
* the use of arms must not produce evils and disorders graver than the evil to be eliminated (the power of modern means of destruction weighs very heavily in evaluating this condition).

The ''[[Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church]]'' elaborates on the Just War Doctrine in paragraphs 500 to 501:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.vatican.va/roman_curia/pontifical_councils/justpeace/documents/rc_pc_justpeace_doc_20060526_compendio-dott-soc_en.html|title=Compendium of the Social Doctrine of the Church|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

:If this responsibility justifies the possession of sufficient means to exercise this right to defence, States still have the obligation to do everything possible "to ensure that the conditions of peace exist, not only within their own territory but throughout the world". It is important to remember that "it is one thing to wage a war of self-defence; it is quite another to seek to impose domination on another nation. The possession of war potential does not justify the use of force for political or military objectives. Nor does the mere fact that war has unfortunately broken out mean that all is fair between the warring parties".
:The [[Charter of the United Nations]] intends to preserve future generations from war with a prohibition against force to resolve disputes between States. Like most philosophy, it permits legitimate defence and measures to maintain peace. In every case, the charter requires that self-defence must respect the traditional limits of necessity and proportionality.

:Therefore, engaging in a preventive war without clear proof that an attack is imminent cannot fail to raise serious moral and juridical questions. International legitimacy for the use of armed force, on the basis of rigorous assessment and with well-founded motivations, can only be given by the decision of a competent body that identifies specific situations as threats to peace and authorizes an intrusion into the sphere of autonomy usually reserved to a State.

===Formally described as "just war"===
The first work dedicated specifically to it was ''De bellis justis'' of [[Stanisław of Skarbimierz]] (1360–1431), who justified war by the [[Kingdom of Poland (1385–1569)|Kingdom of Poland]] with [[Teutonic Knights]].{{Citation needed|date=August 2012}} [[Francisco de Vitoria]] criticized the conquest of America by the [[Kingdom of Spain]] on the basis of just war theory.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | url=https://avemarialaw-law-review.avemarialaw.edu/Content/articles/AMLR.v.10i2.salas.pdf | format=PDF | title=Francisco de Vitoria on the Ius Gentium and the American Indios| journal=Ave Maria Law Review | date=2012 | author=Victor M. Salas, Jr.}}&lt;/ref&gt; With [[Alberico Gentili]] and [[Hugo Grotius]] just war theory was replaced by [[international law]] theory, codified as a set of rules, which today still encompass the points commonly debated, with some modifications.&lt;ref&gt;[[Gutman]] R, Rieff D. ''[[Crimes of War]]: What the Public Should Know''. New York, NY: [[W. W. Norton &amp; Company]]; 1999&lt;/ref&gt; The importance of the theory of just war faded with the revival of [[classical republicanism]] beginning with works of [[Thomas Hobbes]].

Although the criticism can be made that the application of just war theory is [[relativism|relativistic]], one of the fundamental bases of the tradition is the [[Ethic of Reciprocity]], particularly when it comes to ''in bello'' considerations of deportment during battle. If one set of combatants promise to treat their enemies with a modicum of restraint and respect, then the hope is that other sets of combatants will do similarly in reciprocation, (a concept not unrelated to the considerations of [[Game Theory]]).

Just war theorists combine a moral abhorrence towards war with a readiness to accept that war may sometimes be necessary. The criteria of the just war tradition act as an aid to determining whether resorting to arms is morally permissible. Just war theories are attempts "to distinguish between justifiable and unjustifiable uses of organized armed forces"; they attempt "to conceive of how the use of arms might be restrained, made more humane, and ultimately directed towards the aim of establishing lasting [[peace]] and [[justice]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justwartheory.com |title=JustWarTheory.com |publisher=JustWarTheory.com |date= |accessdate=2010-03-16}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The just war tradition addresses the morality of the use of force in two parts: when it is right to resort to armed force (the concern of ''[[jus ad bellum]]'') and what is acceptable in using such force (the concern of ''[[jus in bello]]'').&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eppc.org/publications/pubID.1998/pub_detail.asp |title=Home &gt; Publications &gt; |publisher=Eppc.org |date=1998-09-01 |accessdate=2010-03-16 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090509230737/http://www.eppc.org/publications/pubID.1998/pub_detail.asp |archivedate=2009-05-09 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; In more recent years, a third category—''[[jus post bellum]]''—has been added, which governs the justice of war termination and peace agreements, as well as the prosecution of war criminals.

Soviet leader [[Vladimir Lenin]] defined only three types of just war&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Just Wars in the Light of Marxism|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|first=Erich|last=Wollenberg|url=https://www.marxists.org/history/etol/newspape/ni/vol03/no01/wollenberg.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;, all of which share the central trait of being revolutionary in character. In simple terms: "To the Russian workers has fallen the honour and the good fortune of being the first to start the revolution—the great and only legitimate and just war, the war of the oppressed against the oppressors."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Revolution in Russia and the Tasks of the Workers of All Countries|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1917/mar/12b.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;, with these two opposing categories being defined in terms of class, as is typical in the left. In that manner, Lenin shunned the more common interpretation of a defensive war as a just one -- often summarized as "who fired the first shot?" -- precisely because it didn't take in consideration the class factor. Which side initiated aggressions or had a grievance or any other commonly considered factor of ''jus ad bellum'' mattered not at all, he claimed; if one side was being oppressed by the other, the war against the oppressor would always be, by definition, a defensive war anyway. Any war lacking this duality of oppressed and oppressor was, in contradistinction, always a reactionary, unjust war, in which the oppressed effectively fight in order to protect their own oppressors:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
"But picture to yourselves a slave-owner who owned 100 slaves warring against a slave-owner who owned 200 slaves for a more "just" distribution of slaves. Clearly, the application of the term "defensive" war, or war "for the defence of the fatherland" in such a case would be historically false, and in practice would be sheer deception of the common people, of philistines, of ignorant people, by the astute slaveowners. Precisely in this way are the present-day imperialist bourgeoisie deceiving the peoples by means of "national ideology" and the term "defence of the fatherland" in the present war between slave-owners for fortifying and strengthening slavery."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Socialism and War, ch. 1|publisher=Marxists Internet Archive|first=Vladimir|last=Lenin|url=https://www.marxists.org/archive/lenin/works/1915/s+w/ch01.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Anarcho-capitalism|Anarcho-capitalist]] scholar [[Murray Rothbard]] stated: "a ''just'' war exists when a people tries to ward off the threat of coercive domination by another people, or to overthrow an already-existing domination. A war is ''unjust'', on the other hand, when a people try to impose domination on another people, or try to retain an already existing coercive rule over them."&lt;ref&gt;[http://archive.lewrockwell.com/rothbard/rothbard20.html] This article is based on the talk given by the late Murray N. Rothbard at the Mises Institute’s Costs of War conference in Atlanta, May 1994. It was published in the book of the same name.

[[Jonathan Riley-Smith]] writes,
&lt;blockquote&gt;
The consensus among Christians on the use of violence has changed radically since the crusades were fought. The just war theory prevailing for most of the last two centuries—that violence is an evil that can, in certain situations, be condoned as the lesser of evils—is relatively young. Although it has inherited some elements (the criteria of legitimate authority, just cause, right intention) from the older war theory that first evolved around AD 400, it has rejected two premises that underpinned all medieval just wars, including crusades: first, that violence could be employed on behalf of Christ's intentions for mankind and could even be directly authorized by him; and second, that it was a morally neutral force that drew whatever ethical coloring it had from the intentions of the perpetrators.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Rethinking the Crusades |publisher=Catholic Education Resource Center |first=Jonathan R. |last=Smith |url=http://www.catholiceducation.org/articles/history/world/wh0042.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Criteria==
{{War}}
Just War Theory has two sets of criteria, the first establishing ''jus ad bellum'' (the right to go to war), and the second establishing ''jus in bello'' (right conduct within war).&lt;ref name=Childress&gt;{{Cite journal | author = Childress, James F. | title = Just-War Theories: The Bases, Interrelations, Priorities, and Functions of Their Criteria | journal = Theological Studies | volume = 39 | year = 1978 | pages = 427–45 | authorlink = James Childress }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===''Jus ad bellum''===
{{Main article|Jus ad bellum}}
;Just cause: The reason for going to war needs to be just and cannot therefore be solely for recapturing things taken or punishing people who have done wrong; innocent life must be in imminent danger and intervention must be to protect life. A contemporary view of just cause was expressed in 1993 when the US Catholic Conference said: ''"Force may be used only to correct a grave, public evil, i.e., aggression or massive violation of the basic human rights of whole populations."''
;Comparative justice: While there may be rights and wrongs on all sides of a conflict, to overcome the presumption against the use of force, the injustice suffered by one party must significantly outweigh that suffered by the other. Some theorists such as [[Brian Orend]] omit this term, seeing it as fertile ground for exploitation by bellicose regimes.
;Competent authority: Only duly constituted public [[authorities]] may wage war. "A just war must be initiated by a political authority within a political system that allows distinctions of justice. Dictatorships (e.g. Hitler's Regime) or deceptive military actions (e.g. the [[Operation Menu|1968 US bombing of Cambodia]]) are typically considered as violations of this criterion. The importance of this condition is key. Plainly, we cannot have a genuine process of judging a just war within a system that represses the process of genuine justice. A just war must be initiated by a political authority within a political system that allows distinctions of justice".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://oregonstate.edu/instruct/phl201/modules/just_war_theory/criteria_intro.html|title=Just War Theory|publisher=|accessdate=25 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
;Right intention: Force may be used only in a truly just cause and solely for that purpose—correcting a suffered wrong is considered a right intention, while material gain or maintaining economies is not.
;Probability of success: Arms may not be used in a futile cause or in a case where disproportionate measures are required to achieve success;
;Last resort: Force may be used only after all peaceful and viable alternatives have been seriously tried and exhausted or are clearly not practical. It may be clear that the other side is using negotiations as a delaying tactic and will not make meaningful concessions.
;Proportionality: The anticipated benefits of waging a war must be proportionate to its expected evils or harms. This principle is also known as the principle of macro-proportionality, so as to distinguish it from the ''jus in bello'' principle of proportionality.

In modern terms, just war is waged in terms of self-defense, or in defense of another (with sufficient evidence).

===''Jus in bello''===
Once war has begun, just war theory (''jus in bello'') also directs how [[combatant]]s are to act or should act:

;[[Distinction (law)|Distinction]]: Just war conduct should be governed by the principle of distinction. The acts of war should be directed towards enemy combatants, and not towards [[non-combatant]]s caught in circumstances they did not create. The prohibited acts include bombing civilian residential areas that include no [[legitimate military target]]s, committing acts of [[terrorism]] and [[reprisal]] against civilians, and attacking [[Neutrality (international relations)|neutral]] targets. Moreover, combatants are not permitted to attack enemy combatants who have surrendered or who have been captured or who are injured and not presenting an immediate lethal threat or who are [[attacks on parachutists|parachuting from disabled aircraft]] (except [[airborne forces]]) or who are [[shipwreck]]ed.

;[[Proportionality (law)#International law|Proportionality]]: Just war conduct should be governed by the principle of proportionality. Combatants must make sure that the harm caused to civilians or civilian property is not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated by an attack on a [[legitimate military target|legitimate military objective]]. This principle is meant to discern the correct balance between the restriction imposed by a corrective measure and the severity of the nature of the prohibited act.

;[[Military necessity]]: Just war conduct should be governed by the principle of military necessity. An attack or action must be intended to help in the defeat of the enemy; it must be an attack on a [[legitimate military target|legitimate military objective]], and the harm caused to civilians or civilian property must be proportional and not excessive in relation to the concrete and direct military advantage anticipated. This principle is meant to limit excessive and unnecessary death and destruction.

;Fair treatment of [[prisoners of war]]: Enemy combatants who surrendered or who are captured no longer pose a threat. It is therefore wrong to torture them or otherwise mistreat them.

;No means [[malum in se]]: Combatants may not use weapons or other methods of warfare that are considered evil, such as mass rape, forcing enemy combatants to fight against their own side or using weapons whose effects cannot be controlled (e.g., [[nuclear weapon|nuclear]]/[[biological weapons]]).

==Official positions==

===World War I===
In April 1917, two weeks after the [[United States Congress]] declared war on Germany, Cardinal [[James Gibbons]] of [[Baltimore]], the ''de facto'' head of the U.S. Catholic church, issued a letter that all Catholics were to support the war.&lt;ref name=NCR&gt;{{cite web|title=Ben Salmon and the Army of Peace |url=http://ncronline.org/blogs/road-peace/ben-salmon-and-army-peace |publisher=''[[National Catholic Reporter]]'' |author=John Dear |date=February 23, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Episcopal bishop of New York, [[William Manning (Bishop of New York)|William Manning]] said the following: {{quote|Our Lord Jesus Christ does not stand for peace at any price&amp;nbsp;... Every true American would rather see this land face war than see her flag lowered in dishonor&amp;nbsp;... I wish to say that, not only from the standpoint of a citizen, but from the standpoint of a minister of religion&amp;nbsp;... I believe there is nothing that would be of such great practical benefit to us as universal military training for the men of our land.}}
{{quote|If by Pacifism is meant the teaching that the use of force is never justifiable, then, however well meant, it is mistaken, and it is hurtful to the life of our country. And the Pacifism which takes the position that because war is evil, therefore all who engage in war, whether for offense or defense, are equally blameworthy, and to be condemned, is not only unreasonable, it is inexcusably unjust.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=A History of the Parish of Trinity Church in the City of New York: The rectorship of Dr. William Thomas Manning 1908 to 1921|author=C. T. Bridgeman|year=1962|page=256}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Ending a war: ''Jus post bellum''==
In recent years, some theorists, such as Gary Bass, Louis Iasiello and Brian Orend, have proposed a third category within Just War theory. ''Jus post bellum'' concerns justice after a war, including peace treaties, reconstruction, environmental remediation, war crimes trials, and war reparations.  ''Jus post bellum''  has been added to deal with the fact that some hostile actions may take place outside a traditional battlefield. ''Jus post bellum'' governs the justice of war termination and peace agreements, as well as the prosecution of war criminals, and publicly labeled terrorists. This idea has largely been added to help decide what to do if there are prisoners that have been taken during battle. It is, through government labeling and public opinion, that people use ''jus post bellum'' to justify the pursuit of labeled terrorist for the safety of the government's state in a modern context. The actual fault lies with the aggressor, so by being the aggressor they forfeit their rights for honorable treatment by their actions. This is the theory used to justify the actions taken by anyone fighting in a war to treat prisoners outside of war.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Studies in Moral philosophy: Just War Theory|date=October 2012|publisher=Brill|isbn=978-9004228504 |page=187&lt;!--|pages=232|accessdate=October 27,2016--&gt;|last1=Brooks|first1=Thom}}&lt;/ref&gt; Actions after a conflict can be warranted by actions observed during war, meaning that there can be justification to meet violence with violence even after war. Orend, who was one of the theorist mentioned earlier, proposes the following principles:

;Just cause for termination:A state may terminate a war if there has been a reasonable vindication of the rights that were violated in the first place, and if the aggressor is willing to negotiate the terms of surrender. These terms of surrender include a formal apology, compensations, war crimes trials and perhaps rehabilitation. Alternatively, a state may end a war if it becomes clear that any just goals of the war cannot be reached at all or cannot be reached without using excessive force.
;Right intention:A state must only terminate a war under the conditions agreed upon in the above criteria. Revenge is not permitted. The victor state must also be willing to apply the same level of objectivity and investigation into any war crimes its armed forces may have committed.
;Public declaration and authority:The terms of peace must be made by a legitimate authority, and the terms must be accepted by a legitimate authority.
;Discrimination:The victor state is to differentiate between political and military leaders, and combatants and civilians. Punitive measures are to be limited to those directly responsible for the conflict. [[Truth and Reconciliation Commission (South Africa)|Truth and reconciliation]] may sometimes be more important than punishing war crimes.
;Proportionality:Any terms of surrender must be proportional to the rights that were initially violated. Draconian measures, absolutionist crusades and any attempt at denying the surrendered country the right to participate in the world community are not permitted.

==Alternative theories==
There are many theories that correlate with the Just War Theory doctrine, which include:
* [[Militarism]] – Militarism is the belief that war is not inherently bad but can be a beneficial aspect of society.
* [[Realism in international relations|Realism]] – The core proposition of realism is a skepticism as to whether moral concepts such as justice can be applied to the conduct of international affairs. Proponents of realism believe that moral concepts should never prescribe, nor circumscribe, a state's behaviour. Instead, a state should place an emphasis on state security and self-interest. One form of realism – descriptive realism – proposes that states cannot act morally, while another form – prescriptive realism – argues that the motivating factor for a state is self-interest. Just wars that violate Just Wars principles effectively constitute a branch of realism.
* [[Revolution]] and [[civil war]] – Just war theory states that a just war must have just authority. To the extent that this is interpreted as a legitimate government, this leaves little room for revolutionary war or civil war, in which an illegitimate entity may declare war for reasons that fit the remaining criteria of just war theory. This is less of a problem if the "just authority" is widely interpreted as "the will of the people" or similar. Article 3 of the 1949 [[Geneva Conventions]] side-steps this issue by stating that if one of the parties to a civil war is a High Contracting Party (in practice, the state recognised by the international community), both Parties to the conflict are bound "as a minimum, the following [humanitarian] provisions". Article 4 of the [[Third Geneva Convention]] also makes clear that the treatment of prisoners of war is binding on both parties even when captured soldiers have an "allegiance to a government or an authority not recognized by the Detaining Power".
* [[Moral absolutism|Absolutism]] – Absolutism holds that there are various ethical rules that are absolute. Breaking such moral rules is never legitimate and therefore is always unjustifiable.

 |width  = 30%
 |align  = right
}}
* [[Pacifism]] – Pacifism is the belief that war of any kind is morally unacceptable and/or pragmatically not worth the cost. Pacifists extend humanitarian concern not just to enemy civilians but also to combatants, especially conscripts. For example, [[Ben Salmon]] believed all war to be unjust. He was sentenced to death during World War I (later commuted to 25 years hard labor) for desertion and spreading propaganda.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| author = Staff of the Catholic Peace Fellowship| year= 2007| month=| title=The Life and Witness of Ben Salmon| journal = Sign of Peace | volume = 6.1| issue = Spring 2007| pages =| id =| url = http://www.catholicpeacefellowship.org/nextpage.asp?m=2524}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Self-defense|Right of self-defence]] – The theory of self-defence based on [[Ethical egoism|rational self-interest]] maintains that the use of retaliatory force is justified against repressive nations that break the [[non-aggression principle]]. In addition, if a free country is itself subject to foreign aggression, it is morally imperative for that nation to defend itself and its citizens by whatever means necessary. Thus, any means to achieve a swift and complete victory over the enemy is imperative. This view is prominently held by [[Objectivism (Ayn Rand)|Objectivists]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theobjectivestandard.com/issues/2006-spring/just-war-theory.asp "'Just War Theory'" vs. American Self-Defence], by [[Yaron Brook]] and Alex Epstein&lt;/ref&gt;
* [[Consequentialism]] – The moral theory most frequently summarized in the words "the end justifies the means", which tends to support the just war theory (unless the just war causes less beneficial means to become necessary, which further requires worst actions for self-defense with bad consequences).

'''Krogh model''' is a [[Scientific modelling|scientific model]] in the area [[mass transfer]] explaining concentration of [[oxygen|molecular oxygen]] through a [[Cylinder (geometry)|cylindrical]] [[Capillary action|capillary tube]] as a function of a changing position over the capillary tube's length. It was first conceptualized by [[August Krogh]] in 1919 to describe oxygen supply in living tissues, particularly the one occurring in human [[blood vessel]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wei|Anderson|1995|p=176.}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Its applicability has been extended to various academic fields, and has been successful explaining drug diffusion, water transport, and ice formation in tissues.&lt;ref name="Biomed Experts"&gt;{{cite journal| title=Axial oxygen diffusion in the Krogh model: modifications to account for myocardial oxygen tension in isolated perfused rat hearts measured by EPR oximetry.| pmid=16594144 | doi=10.1007/0-387-26206-7_18 | volume=566| journal=Adv Exp Med Biol| pages=127-34 | last1 = Grinberg | first1 = O | last2 = Novozhilov | first2 = B | last3 = Grinberg | first3 = S | last4 = Friedman | first4 = B | last5 = Swartz | first5 = HM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mathematical modeling==
Krogh model is derived by applying [[Fick's laws of diffusion]] and the [[Conservation of mass|law of conservation of mass]] over a radial [[Interval (mathematics)|interval]] &lt;math&gt;Rc \le r \le Rt&lt;/math&gt;

==Limitations==
Although Krogh model is a good approximation, it underestimates oxygen consumption&lt;ref name="Biomed Experts" /&gt; because the cylinder model does not include all the tissue surrounding the capillary.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Truskey|Fan|Katz|2009|p=643.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="98005">'''Lamarckism''' (or '''Lamarckian inheritance''') is the hypothesis that an [[organism]] can pass on characteristics that it has acquired through use or disuse during its lifetime to its [[offspring]]. It is also known as the '''inheritance of acquired characteristics''' or '''soft inheritance'''. It is inaccurately&lt;ref name=Ghiselin1994/&gt;&lt;ref name=Gould2002p177/&gt; named after the French [[biologist]] [[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] (1744–1829), who incorporated the action of soft inheritance into his evolutionary theories as a supplement to his concept of [[orthogenesis]], a drive towards [[Evolution of biological complexity|complexity]]. The theory is cited in textbooks to contrast with [[Darwinism]]. This paints a false picture of the history of biology, as Lamarck did not originate the idea of soft inheritance, which was known from the [[classical era]] onwards, and it was not the primary focus of Lamarck's theory of evolution. Further, in ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' (1859), [[Charles Darwin]] supported the idea of "use and disuse inheritance", though rejecting other aspects of Lamarck's theory.

Many researchers from the 1860s onwards attempted to find evidence for the theory, but these have all been explained away either by other mechanisms such as genetic contamination, or as fraud. Later, [[Mendelian inheritance|Mendelian genetics]] supplanted the notion of inheritance of acquired traits, eventually leading to the development of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]], and the general abandonment of the Lamarckism in [[biology]].

==Early history==
===Origins===
[[File:Jean-baptiste lamarck2.jpg|thumb|[[Jean-Baptiste Lamarck]] repeated the ancient folk wisdom of the inheritance of acquired characteristics.]]

The inheritance of acquired characteristics was proposed in ancient times, and remained a current idea for many centuries. The historian of science [[Conway Zirkle]] wrote in 1935 that:&lt;ref name=Zirkle1935/&gt;

{{quote|Lamarck was neither the first nor the most distinguished biologist to believe in the inheritance of acquired characters. He merely endorsed a belief which had been generally accepted for at least 2,200 years before his time and used it to explain how evolution could have taken place. The inheritance of acquired characters had been accepted previously by [[Hippocrates]], [[Aristotle]], [[Galen]], [[Roger Bacon]], [[Jerome Cardan]], [[Levinus Lemnius]], [[John Ray]], [[Michel Adanson|Michael Adanson]], [[Johann Friedrich Blumenbach|Jo. Fried. Blumenbach]] and [[Erasmus Darwin]] among others.&lt;ref name=Zirkle1935&gt;{{cite journal | last1=Zirkle | first1=Conway | authorlink=Conway Zirkle | year=1935 | title=The Inheritance of Acquired Characters and the Provisional Hypothesis of Pangenesis| journal=The American Naturalist | volume=69 | issue=724| pages=417–445 | doi=10.1086/280617}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}
Zirkle noted that Hippocrates described [[pangenesis]], the theory that what is inherited derives from the whole body of the parent, whereas Aristotle thought it impossible; but that all the same, Aristotle implicitly agreed to the inheritance of acquired characteristics, giving the example of the inheritance of a scar, or of blindness, though noting that children do not always resemble their parents. Zirkle recorded that [[Pliny the Elder]] thought much the same. Zirkle also pointed out that stories involving the idea of inheritance of acquired characteristics appear numerous times in ancient mythology and the Bible, and persisted through to [[Rudyard Kipling]]'s ''[[Just So Stories]]''.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1946" /&gt; Erasmus Darwin's ''[[Zoonomia]]'' (c. 1795) suggested that [[warm-blooded]] [[animal]]s develop from "one living filament... with the power of acquiring new parts" in response to stimuli, with each round of "improvements" being inherited by successive generations.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Darwin|1794–1796|loc=[http://www.gutenberg.org/files/15707/15707-h/15707-h.htm#sect_XXXIX Vol I, section XXXIX]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Darwin's pangenesis===
[[File:Darwin's Pangenesis.svg|thumb|upright=1.5|[[Charles Darwin]]'s [[pangenesis]] theory. Every part of the body emits tiny gemmules which migrate to the [[gonad]]s and contribute to the next generation via the fertilised egg. Changes to the body during an organism's life would be inherited, as in Lamarckism.]]
{{main|Pangenesis}}

[[Charles Darwin]]'s ''[[On the Origin of Species]]'' proposed natural selection as the main mechanism for development of species, but did not rule out a variant of Lamarckism as a supplementary mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Desmond|Moore|1991|p=617}}: "But Darwin was {{sic|hide=y|loath}} to let go of the notion that a well-used and strengthened organ could be inherited."&lt;/ref&gt; Darwin called this pangenesis, and explained it in the final chapter of his book ''[[The Variation of Animals and Plants under Domestication]]'' (1868), after describing numerous examples to demonstrate what he considered to be the inheritance of acquired characteristics. Pangenesis, which he emphasised was a hypothesis, was based on the idea that [[somatic cell]]s would, in response to environmental stimulation (use and disuse), throw off '[[Gemmule (pangenesis)|gemmules]]' or 'pangenes' which travelled around the body, though not necessarily in the [[Circulatory system|bloodstream]]. These pangenes were microscopic particles that supposedly contained information about the characteristics of their parent cell, and Darwin believed that they eventually accumulated in the [[germ cell]]s where they could pass on to the next generation the newly acquired characteristics of the parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Darwin |first=Charles |authorlink=Charles Darwin |date=April 27, 1871 |title=Pangenesis |url=http://www.nature.com/nature/journal/v3/n78/abs/003502a0.html |journal=Nature |volume=3 |issue=78 |pages=502–503 |bibcode=1871Natur...3..502D |doi=10.1038/003502a0}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Darwin's half-cousin, [[Francis Galton]], carried out experiments on [[rabbit]]s, with Darwin's cooperation, in which he transfused the [[blood]] of one variety of rabbit into another variety in the expectation that its offspring would show some characteristics of the first. They did not, and Galton declared that he had disproved Darwin's hypothesis of pangenesis, but Darwin objected, in a letter to the scientific journal ''[[Nature (journal)|Nature]]'', that he had done nothing of the sort, since he had never mentioned blood in his writings. He pointed out that he regarded pangenesis as occurring in [[protozoa]] and [[plant]]s, which have no blood, as well as in animals.&lt;ref name=Liu2008&gt;{{Cite journal |last=Liu |first=Yongsheng |date=2008 |title=A new perspective on Darwin's Pangenesis |journal=Biological Reviews |volume=83 |issue=2 |pages=141–149 |doi=10.1111/j.1469-185x.2008.00036.x|pmid=18429766 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Lamarck's evolutionary framework===

[[File:Lamarck's Two-Factor Theory.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|Lamarck's two-factor theory involves 1) a complexifying force that drives animal [[body plan]]s towards higher levels ([[orthogenesis]]) creating a ladder of [[phylum|phyla]], and 2) an adaptive force that causes animals with a given body plan to adapt to circumstances (use and disuse, [[inheritance of acquired characteristics]]), creating a diversity of [[species]] and [[genus|genera]]. Popular views of Lamarckism only consider an aspect of the adaptive force.]]
{{further|Jean-Baptiste Lamarck#Lamarckian evolution}}

Between 1800 and 1830, Lamarck proposed a systematic theoretical framework for understanding evolution. He saw evolution as comprising four laws:&lt;ref name="Larson2004"&gt;{{cite book |author=Larson, Edward J. |date=2004 |title=A Growing sense of progress |work=Evolution: The remarkable history of a Scientific Theory |publisher=Modern Library |pages=38–41}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Gould2001"&gt;{{cite book | last=Gould | first=Stephen | title=The lying stones of Marrakech : penultimate reflections in natural history | publisher=Vintage | year=2001 | isbn=978-0-09-928583-0 | pages=119–121}}&lt;/ref&gt;

# "Life by its own force, tends to increase the volume of all organs which possess the force of life, and the force of life extends the dimensions of those parts up to a extent that those parts bring to themselves;"
# "The production of a new organ in an animal body, results from a new requirement arising. and which continues to make itself felt, and a new movement which that requirement gives birth to, and its upkeep/maintenance;"
# "The development of the organs, and their ability, are constantly a result of the use of those organs."
# "All that has been acquired, traced, or changed, in the physiology of individuals, during their life, is conserved through the genesis, reproduction, and transmitted to new individuals who are related to those who have undergone those changes."

===Lamarck's discussion of heredity===

In 1830, in an aside from his evolutionary framework, Lamarck briefly mentioned two traditional ideas in his discussion of heredity, in his day considered to be generally true. The first was the idea of use versus disuse; he theorized that individuals lose characteristics they do not require, or use, and develop characteristics that are useful. The second was to argue that the acquired traits were heritable. He gave as an imagined illustration the idea that when [[giraffe]]s stretch their necks to reach leaves high in trees, they would strengthen and gradually lengthen their necks. These giraffes would then have offspring with slightly longer necks. In the same way, he argued, a [[blacksmith]], through his work, strengthens the muscles in his arms, and thus his sons would have similar muscular development when they mature. Lamarck stated the following two laws:&lt;ref name=Lamarck1830/&gt;

# ''Première Loi: Dans tout animal qui n' a point dépassé le terme de ses développemens, l' emploi plus fréquent et soutenu d' un organe quelconque, fortifie peu à peu cet organe, le développe, l' agrandit, et lui donne une puissance proportionnée à la durée de cet emploi ; tandis que le défaut constant d' usage de tel organe, l'affoiblit insensiblement, le détériore, diminue progressivement ses facultés, et finit par le faire disparoître.''&lt;ref name=Lamarck1830/&gt;
# ''Deuxième Loi: Tout ce que la nature a fait acquérir ou perdre aux individus par l' influence des circonstances où leur race se trouve depuis long-temps exposée, et, par conséquent, par l' influence de l' emploi prédominant de tel organe, ou par celle d' un défaut constant d' usage de telle partie ; elle le conserve par la génération aux nouveaux individus qui en proviennent, pourvu que les changemens acquis soient communs aux deux sexes, ou à ceux qui ont produit ces nouveaux individus.''&lt;ref name=Lamarck1830&gt;{{harvnb|Lamarck|1830|loc=[http://www.lamarck.cnrs.fr/ice/ice_page_detail.php?lang=fr&amp;type=text&amp;bdd=lamarck&amp;table=ouvrages_lamarck&amp;bookId=29&amp;search=no&amp;typeofbookDes=Livres&amp;facsimile=off&amp;pageOrder=260 p. 235]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

English translation:

# First Law [Use and Disuse]: In every animal which has not passed the limit of its development, a more frequent and continuous use of any organ gradually strengthens, develops and enlarges that organ, and gives it a power proportional to the length of time it has been so used; while the permanent disuse of any organ imperceptibly weakens and deteriorates it, and progressively diminishes its functional capacity, until it finally disappears.
# Second Law [Soft Inheritance]: All the acquisitions or losses wrought by nature on individuals, through the influence of the environment in which their race has long been placed, and hence through the influence of the predominant use or permanent disuse of any organ; all these are preserved by reproduction to the new individuals which arise, provided that the acquired modifications are common to both sexes, or at least to the individuals which produce the young.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Lamarck|1914|p=113}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In essence, a change in the environment brings about change in "needs" (''besoins''), resulting in change in behavior, bringing change in organ usage and development, bringing change in form over time—and thus the gradual [[Transmutation of species|transmutation of the species]]. However, as the evolutionary biologists and historians of science [[Michael Ghiselin]] and [[Steven Jay Gould]] have pointed out, these ideas were not original to Lamarck.&lt;ref name=Ghiselin1994/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Weismann's experiment===
[[File:Weismann's Germ Plasm.svg|thumb|upright=1.7|[[August Weismann]]'s [[germ plasm]] theory. The hereditary material, the germ plasm, is confined to the [[gonad]]s and the [[gamete]]s. Somatic cells (of the body) [[embryology|develop]] afresh in each generation from the germ plasm, creating an invisible "[[Weismann barrier]]" to Lamarckian influence from the soma to the next generation.]]

The idea that germline cells contain information that passes to each generation unaffected by experience and independent of the somatic (body) cells, came to be referred to as the [[Weismann barrier]], as it would make Lamarckian inheritance from changes to the body difficult or impossible.&lt;ref name="Romanes 1893"&gt;{{cite book |last=Romanes |first=George John |title=An examination of Weismannism |publisher=Open Court |year=1893 |url=https://openlibrary.org/books/OL23380098M/An_examination_of_Weismannism}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[August Weismann]] conducted the experiment of removing the tails of 68 [[Laboratory mouse|white mice]], and those of their offspring over five generations, and reporting that no mice were born in consequence without a tail or even with a shorter tail. In 1889, he stated that "901 young were produced by five generations of artificially mutilated parents, and yet there was not a single example of a rudimentary tail or of any other abnormality in this organ."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Weismann|1889|loc="The Supposed Transmission of Mutilations" (1888), [http://www.esp.org/books/weismann/essays/facsimile/contents/weismann-essays-1-ch08.pdf#page=14 p. 432]}}&lt;/ref&gt; The experiment, and the theory behind it, were thought at the time to be a refutation of Lamarckism.&lt;ref name="Romanes 1893"/&gt;

However, the experiment's effectiveness in refuting Lamarck's hypothesis is doubtful, as it did not address the ''use and disuse'' of characteristics in response to the environment. The biologist Peter Gauthier noted in 1990 that:&lt;ref name="Gauthier 1990"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Can Weismann's experiment be considered a case of disuse? Lamarck proposed that when an organ was not used, it slowly, and very gradually atrophied. In time, over the course of many generations, it would gradually disappear as it was inherited in its modified form in each successive generation. Cutting the tails off mice does not seem to meet the qualifications of disuse, but rather falls in a category of accidental misuse... Lamarck's hypothesis has never been proven experimentally and there is no known mechanism to support the idea that somatic change, however acquired, can in some way induce a change in the germplasm. On the other hand it is difficult to disprove Lamarck's idea experimentally, and it seems that Weismann's experiment fails to provide the evidence to deny the Lamarckian hypothesis, since it lacks a key factor, namely the willful exertion of the animal in overcoming environmental obstacles.&lt;ref name="Gauthier 1990"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Gauthier |first=Peter |date=March–May 1990 |title=Does Weismann's Experiment Constitute a Refutation of the Lamarckian Hypothesis? |journal=BIOS |volume=61 |number=1/2 |pages=6–8 |jstor=4608123}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The biologist and historian of science [[Michael Ghiselin]] also considered the Weismann tail-chopping experiment to have no bearing on the Lamarckian hypothesis, writing in 1994 that:&lt;ref name="Ghiselin1994"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;The acquired characteristics that figured in Lamarck's thinking were changes that resulted from an individual's own drives and actions, not from the actions of external agents. Lamarck was not concerned with wounds, injuries or mutilations, and nothing that Lamarck had set forth was tested or "disproven" by the Weismann tail-chopping experiment.&lt;ref name="Ghiselin1994"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Textbook Lamarckism==
[[File:Giraffe feeding, Tanzania.jpg|thumb|The long neck of the [[giraffe]] is often used as an example in popular explanations of Lamarckism. However, this was only a small part of his theory of evolution towards "perfection"; it was a hypothetical illustration; and he used it to discuss his theory of heredity, not evolution.&lt;ref name="Ghiselin1994"/&gt;]]

The identification of Lamarckism with the inheritance of acquired characteristics is regarded by evolutionary biologists including Michael Ghiselin as a falsified artifact of the subsequent history of evolutionary thought, repeated in textbooks without analysis, and wrongly contrasted with a falsified picture of Darwin's thinking. Ghiselin notes that "Darwin accepted the inheritance of acquired characteristics, just as Lamarck did, and Darwin even thought that there was some experimental evidence to support it."&lt;ref name=Ghiselin1994&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Ghiselin |first1=Michael T. |title=The Imaginary Lamarck: A Look at Bogus "History" in Schoolbooks |url=http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm |journal=The Textbook Letter |issue=September–October 1994 |date=1994 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20001012042617/http://www.textbookleague.org/54marck.htm |archivedate=12 October 2000 |deadurl=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;  American [[Paleontology|paleontologist]] and [[History of science|historian of science]] [[Stephen Jay Gould]] wrote that in the late 19th century, evolutionists "re-read Lamarck, cast aside the guts of it ... and elevated one aspect of the mechanics—inheritance of acquired characters—to a central focus it never had for Lamarck himself."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|1980|p=66}}&lt;/ref&gt; He argued that "the restriction of 'Lamarckism' to this relatively small and non-distinctive corner of Lamarck's thought must be labelled as more than a misnomer, and truly a discredit to the memory of a man and his much more comprehensive system."&lt;ref name=Gould2002p177&gt;{{harvnb|Gould|2002|pp=177–178}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=Gould |first=Stephen Jay |authorlink=Stephen Jay Gould |date=October 4, 1979 |title=Another Look at Lamarck |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=kHHYOtogBEgC&amp;pg=PA38&amp;lpg=PA38 |magazine=[[New Scientist]] |volume=84 |issue=1175 |pages=38–40 |accessdate=2015-11-09}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Neo-Lamarckism==

===Context===
{{further|Eclipse of Darwinism}}
[[File:PSM V49 D527 Edward Drinker Cope.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Edward Drinker Cope]]]]

The period of the [[history of evolutionary thought]] between Darwin's death in the 1880s, and the foundation of [[population genetics]] in the 1920s and the beginnings of the modern evolutionary synthesis in the 1930s, is called [[the eclipse of Darwinism]] by some historians of science. During that time many scientists and philosophers accepted the reality of evolution but doubted whether natural selection was the main evolutionary mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quammen|2006|p=216}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the most popular alternatives were theories involving the inheritance of characteristics acquired during an organism's lifetime. Scientists who felt that such Lamarckian mechanisms were the key to evolution were called neo-Lamarckians. They included the British [[Botany|botanist]] [[George Henslow]] (1835–1925), who studied the effects of environmental stress on the growth of plants, in the belief that such environmentally-induced variation might explain much of [[plant evolution]], and the American entomologist [[Alpheus Spring Packard|Alpheus Spring Packard, Jr.]], who studied blind animals living in caves and wrote a book in 1901 about Lamarck and his work.&lt;ref name="Bowler236_244"&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|pp=236–244}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quammen|2006|pp=218, 220}}&lt;/ref&gt; Also included were paleontologists like [[Edward Drinker Cope]] and [[Alpheus Hyatt]], who observed that the fossil record showed orderly, almost linear, patterns of development that they felt were better explained by Lamarckian mechanisms than by natural selection. Some people, including Cope and the Darwin critic [[Samuel Butler (novelist)|Samuel Butler]], felt that inheritance of acquired characteristics would let organisms shape their own evolution, since organisms that acquired new habits would change the use patterns of their organs, which would kick-start Lamarckian evolution. They considered this philosophically superior to Darwin's mechanism of random variation acted on by selective pressures. Lamarckism also appealed to those, like the philosopher [[Herbert Spencer]] and the German anatomist [[Ernst Haeckel]], who saw evolution as an inherently progressive process.&lt;ref name="Bowler236_244" /&gt; The German [[Zoology|zoologist]] [[Theodor Eimer]] combined Larmarckism with ideas about [[orthogenesis]], the idea that evolution is directed towards a goal.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Quammen|2006|p=221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With the development of the [[Modern synthesis (20th century)|modern synthesis]] of the theory of evolution, and a lack of evidence for a mechanism for acquiring and passing on new characteristics, or even their heritability, Lamarckism largely fell from favour. Unlike [[neo-Darwinism]], neo-Lamarckism is a loose grouping of largely heterodox theories and mechanisms that emerged after Lamarck's time, rather than a coherent body of theoretical work.&lt;ref name=Bowler1989Demise&gt;{{Cite book |title=Evolution: The History of an Idea |last=Bowler |first=Peter J. |publisher=University of California Press |year=1989 |origyear=1983 |edition=Revised |isbn=978-0520063860 |pages=257, 264, 279–280}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===19th century===

[[File:Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Charles-Édouard Brown-Séquard]] tried to demonstrate Lamarckism by mutilating [[guinea pig]]s.]]

Neo-Lamarckian versions of evolution were widespread in the late 19th century. The idea that living things could to some degree choose the characteristics that would be inherited allowed them to be in charge of their own destiny as opposed to the Darwinian view, which placed them at the mercy of the environment. Such ideas were more popular than natural selection in the late 19th century as it made it possible for biological evolution to fit into a framework of a divine or naturally willed plan, thus the neo-Lamarckian view of evolution was often advocated by proponents of orthogenesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the historian of science Peter J. Bowler, writing in 2003:

{{blockquote|One of the most emotionally compelling arguments used by the neo-Lamarckians of the late nineteenth century was the claim that Darwinism was a mechanistic theory which reduced living things to puppets driven by heredity. The selection theory made life into a game of Russian roulette, where life or death was predetermined by the genes one inherited. The individual could do nothing to mitigate bad heredity. Lamarckism, in contrast, allowed the individual to choose a new habit when faced with an environmental challenge and shape the whole future course of evolution.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2003|p=367}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Scientists from the 1860s onwards conducted numerous experiments that purported to show Lamarckian inheritance. Some examples are described in the table.

===Late 20th century===
The British anthropologist [[Frederic Wood Jones]] and the South African  paleontologist [[Robert Broom]] supported a neo-Lamarckian view of human evolution.&lt;!--so?--&gt; The German anthropologist [[Hermann Klaatsch]] relied on a neo-Lamarckian model of evolution to try and explain the origin of [[bipedalism]]. Neo-Lamarckism remained influential in biology until the 1940s when the role of natural selection was reasserted in evolution as part of the modern evolutionary synthesis.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Wood|2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
[[Herbert Graham Cannon]], a British zoologist, defended Lamarckism in his 1959 book ''Lamarck and Modern Genetics''.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cannon|1975}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1960s, "biochemical Lamarckism" was advocated by the embryologist [[Paul Wintrebert]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Boesiger|1974|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neo-Lamarckism was dominant in French biology for more than a century.&lt;!--so?--&gt; French scientists who supported neo-Lamarckism included [[Edmond Perrier]] (1844–1921), [[Alfred Mathieu Giard|Alfred Giard]] (1846–1908), [[Gaston Bonnier]] (1853–1922) and [[Pierre-Paul Grassé]] (1895–1985). They followed two traditions, one mechanistic, one [[vitalism|vitalistic]] after [[Henri Bergson]]'s [[Élan vital|philosophy of evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Loison |first=Laurent |date=November 2011 |title=French Roots of French Neo-Lamarckisms, 1879–1985 |journal=Journal of the History of Biology |volume=44 |issue=4 |pages=713–744 |doi=10.1007/s10739-010-9240-x |pmid=20665089}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1987, [[Ryuichi Matsuda]] coined the term "pan-environmentalism" for his evolutionary theory which he saw as a fusion of [[Darwinism]] with neo-Lamarckism. He held that [[heterochrony]] is a main mechanism for evolutionary change and that novelty in evolution can be generated by [[genetic assimilation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pearson |first=Roy Douglas |date=March 1988 |title=Reviews |journal=Acta Biotheoretica |type=Book review |volume=37 |issue=1 |pages=31–36 |doi=10.1007/BF00050806}} Book reviews of ''Animal Evolution in Changing Environments: With Special Reference to Abnormal Metamorphosis'' (1987) by [[Ryuichi Matsuda]] and ''The Evolution of Individuality'' (1987) by [[Leo Buss|Leo W.

Shapiro]] for providing no solid evidence for his theory. Shapiro noted that "Matsuda himself accepts too much at face value and is prone to wish-fulfilling interpretation."&lt;ref name="Shapiro 1988" /&gt;

===Ideological neo-Lamarckism===
[[File:Trofim Lysenko portrait.jpg|thumb|upright|[[Trofim Lysenko]] promoted an ideological form of neo-Lamarckism which adversely influenced [[Soviet Union|Soviet]] agricultural policy in the 1930s.]]

A form of Lamarckism was revived in the [[Soviet Union]] of the 1930s when [[Trofim Lysenko]] promoted the ideologically-driven research programme, [[Lysenkoism]]; this suited the ideological opposition of [[Joseph Stalin]] to [[genetics]]. Lysenkoism influenced Soviet agricultural policy which in turn was later blamed for crop failures.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Baird|Scerri|McIntyre|2006|p=166}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Critique===
[[George Gaylord Simpson]] in his book ''[[Tempo and Mode in Evolution]]'' (1944) claimed that experiments in heredity have failed to corroborate any Lamarckian process.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1944|p=75}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson noted that neo-Lamarckism "stresses a factor that Lamarck rejected: inheritance of direct effects of the environment" and neo-Lamarckism is closer to Darwin's pangenesis than Lamarck's views.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1964|pp=14–60}}&lt;/ref&gt; Simpson wrote, "the inheritance of acquired characters, failed to meet the tests of observation and has been almost universally discarded by biologists."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Simpson|1965|p=451}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Botanist Conway Zirkle pointed out that Lamarck did not originate the hypothesis that [[Inheritance of acquired characteristics|acquired characters were heritable]], therefore it is incorrect to refer to it as Lamarckism:

&lt;blockquote&gt;What Lamarck really did was to accept the hypothesis that acquired characters were heritable, a notion which had been held almost universally for well over two thousand years and which his contemporaries accepted as a matter of course, and to assume that the results of such inheritance were cumulative from generation to generation, thus producing, in time, new species. His individual contribution to biological theory consisted in his application to the problem of the origin of species of the view that acquired characters were inherited and in showing that evolution could be inferred logically from the accepted biological hypotheses. He would doubtless have been greatly astonished to learn that a belief in the inheritance of acquired characters is now labeled "Lamarckian," although he would almost certainly have felt flattered if evolution itself had been so designated.&lt;ref name="Zirkle 1946"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Zirkle |first=Conway |authorlink=Conway Zirkle |date=January 1946 |title=The Early History of the Idea of the Inheritance of Acquired Characters and of Pangenesis |journal=Transactions of the American Philosophical Society |volume=35 |issue=2 |pages=91–151 |doi=10.2307/1005592 |jstor=1005592}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Peter Medawar]] wrote regarding Lamarckism, "very few professional biologists believe that anything of the kind occurs—or can occur—but the notion persists for a variety of nonscientific reasons." Medawar stated there is no known mechanism by which an adaptation acquired in an individual's lifetime can be imprinted on the genome and Lamarckian inheritance is not valid unless it excludes the possibility of natural selection but this has not been demonstrated in any experiment.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Medawar|1985|pp=166–169}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Martin Gardner]] wrote in his book ''[[Fads and Fallacies in the Name of Science]]'' (1957):

&lt;blockquote&gt;A host of experiments have been designed to test Lamarckianism. All that have been verified have proved negative. On the other hand, tens of thousands of experiments— reported in the journals and carefully checked and rechecked by geneticists throughout the world— have established the correctness of the gene-mutation theory beyond all reasonable doubt... In spite of the rapidly increasing evidence for natural selection, Lamarck has never ceased to have loyal followers....

According to Ernst Mayr, any Lamarckian theory involving the inheritance of acquired characters has been refuted as "[[DNA]] does not directly participate in the making of the phenotype and that the phenotype, in turn, does not control the composition of the DNA."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Mayr|1997|p=222}}: "...the recognition that DNA does not directly participate in the making of the phenotype and that the phenotype, in turn, does not control the composition of the DNA represents the ultimate invalidation of all theories involving the inheritance of acquired characters. This definitive refutation of Lamarck's theory of evolutionary causation clears the air."&lt;/ref&gt; Peter J. Bowler has written that although many early scientists took Lamarckism seriously, it was discredited by genetics in the early twentieth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Bowler|2013|p=21}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Joseph Springer and Dennis Holley commented in 2013 that:&lt;ref name="SpringerHolley2013"/&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;Lamarck and his ideas were ridiculed and discredited. In a strange twist of fate, Lamarck may have the last laugh. Epigenetics, an emerging field of genetics, has shown that Lamarck may have been at least partially correct all along. It seems that reversible and heritable changes can occur without a change in DNA sequence (genotype) and that such changes may be induced spontaneously or in response to environmental factors—Lamarck's "acquired traits." Determining which observed phenotypes are genetically inherited and which are environmentally induced remains an important and ongoing part of the study of genetics, developmental biology, and medicine.&lt;ref name="SpringerHolley2013"&gt;{{harvnb|Springer|Holley|2013|p=94}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The [[Prokaryote|prokaryotic]] [[CRISPR]] system and [[Piwi-interacting RNA]] could be classified as Lamarckian, within a Darwinian framework.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Koonin |first1=Eugene V. |authorlink1=Eugene Koonin |last2=Wolf |first2=Yuri I. |date=November 11, 2009 |title=Is evolution Darwinian or/and Lamarckian? |journal=Biology Direct |volume=4 |page=42 |doi=10.1186/1745-6150-4-42 |pmc=2781790 |pmid=19906303}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, the significance of epigenetics in evolution is uncertain. Critics such as [[Jerry Coyne]] point out that epigenetic inheritance lasts for only a few generations, so it is not a stable basis for evolutionary change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2010/10/24/epigenetics-the-light-and-the-way/ |title=Epigenetics: the light and the way? |last=Coyne |first=Jerry |authorlink=Jerry Coyne |date=October 24, 2010 |website=Why Evolution Is True |type=Blog |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://whyevolutionistrue.wordpress.com/2013/09/23/epigenetics-smackdown-at-the-guardian/ |title=Epigenetics smackdown at the Guardian |last=Coyne |first=Jerry |date=September 23, 2013 |website=Why Evolution is True |type=Blog |accessdate=2015-11-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="González 2015"&gt;González-Recio O, Toro MA, Bach A.

The evolutionary biologist [[T. Ryan Gregory]] contends that epigenetic inheritance should not be considered Lamarckian. According to Gregory, Lamarck did not claim the environment imposed direct effects on organisms. Instead, Lamarck "argued that the environment created needs to which organisms responded by using some features more and others less, that this resulted in those features being accentuated or attenuated, and that this difference was then inherited by offspring." Gregory has stated that Lamarckian evolution in the context of epigenetics is actually closer to Darwin's view rather than Lamarck's.&lt;ref name="Ryan 2009"/&gt;

In 2007, [[David Haig (biologist)|David Haig]] wrote that research into epigenetic processes does allow a Lamarckian element in evolution but the processes do not challenge the main tenets of the modern evolutionary synthesis as modern Lamarckians have claimed. Haig argued for the primacy of DNA and evolution of epigenetic switches by natural selection.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haig |first=David |authorlink=David Haig (biologist) |date=June 2007 |title=Weismann Rules!

Recurrent, predictable changes of epigenetic state provide a useful set of switches that allow genetically-identical cells to acquire differentiated functions and allow facultative responses of a genotype to environmental changes (provided that 'similar' changes have occurred repeatedly in the past). However, most neo-Darwinists would claim that the ability to adaptively switch epigenetic state is a property of the DNA sequence (in the sense that alternative sequences would show different switching behavior) and that any increase of adaptedness in the system has come about by a process of natural selection.}}&lt;/ref&gt; Haig has written that there is a "visceral attraction" to Lamarckian evolution from the public and some scientists, as it posits the world with a meaning, in which organisms can shape their own evolutionary destiny.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Haig |first=David |date=November 2011 |title=Lamarck Ascending! |journal=Philosophy &amp; Theory in Biology |type=Book essay |volume=3 |issue=e204 |doi=10.3998/ptb.6959004.0003.004}} "A Review of ''Transformations of Lamarckism: From Subtle Fluids to Molecular Biology'', edited by Snait B. Gissis and Eva Jablonka, MIT Press, 2011"&lt;/ref&gt;

Thomas Dickens and Qazi Rahman (2012) have argued that epigenetic mechanisms such as DNA methylation and histone modification are genetically inherited under the control of natural selection and do not challenge the modern synthesis. They dispute the claims of Jablonka and Lamb on Lamarckian epigenetic processes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Dickins |first1=Thomas E. |last2=Rahman |first2=Qazi |date=August 7, 2012 |title=The extended evolutionary synthesis and the role of soft inheritance in evolution |journal=Proceedings of the Royal Society B |volume=279 |issue=1740 |pages=2913–2921 |doi=10.1098/rspb.2012.0273 |pmc=3385474 |pmid=22593110}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Somatic hypermutation and reverse transcription to germline===

In the 1970s, the Australian immunologist [[Edward J. Steele]] developed a neo-Lamarckian theory of [[somatic hypermutation]] within the immune system and coupled it to the [[reverse transcription]] of RNA derived from body cells to the DNA of [[germline]] cells. This reverse transcription process supposedly enabled characteristics or bodily changes acquired during a lifetime to be written back into the DNA and passed on to subsequent generations.&lt;ref name="Steele2016"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steele |first1=E.J. |title=Somatic hypermutation in immunity and cancer: Critical analysis of strand-biased and codon-context mutation signatures |year=2016 |journal=DNA Repair |volume=45|pages=1–24 |doi=10.1016/j.dnarep.2016.07.001 |pmid=27449479}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Steele1987"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Steele |first=E.J. |last2=Pollard |first2=J.W. |year=1987 |title=Hypothesis : Somatic Hypermutation by gene conversion via the error prone DNA-to-RNA-to-DNA information loop |journal=Molecular Immunology |volume=24 |issue=6 |pages=667–673 |doi=10.1016/j.dnarep.2016.07.001 |pmid=2443841}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The mechanism was meant to explain why homologous [[Nucleic acid sequence|DNA sequences]] from the [[V(D)J recombination|VDJ gene]] regions of parent mice were found in their germ cells and seemed to persist in the offspring for a few generations. The mechanism involved the somatic selection and clonal amplification of newly acquired [[antibody]] [[gene]] sequences generated via somatic hypermutation in [[B-cell]]s. The [[messenger RNA]] products of these somatically novel genes were captured by [[retrovirus]]es [[endogenous]] to the B-cells and were then transported through the bloodstream where they could breach the Weismann or soma-germ barrier and reverse transcribe the newly acquired genes into the cells of the germ line, in the manner of Darwin's pangenes.&lt;ref name="Steele1981"&gt;{{Cite book |title=Somatic selection and adaptive evolution : on the inheritance of acquired characters |last=Steele |first=E.

===Hologenome theory of evolution===
{{further|hologenome theory of evolution}}

The [[hologenome theory of evolution]], while Darwinian, has Lamarckian aspects. An individual animal or plant lives in [[symbiosis]] with many [[microorganism]]s, and together they have a "hologenome" consisting of all their genomes. The hologenome can vary like any other genome by [[mutation]], [[sexual recombination]], and [[chromosome rearrangement]], but in addition it can vary when populations of microorganisms increase or decrease (resembling Lamarckian use and disuse), and when it gains new kinds of microorganism (resembling Lamarckian inheritance of acquired characteristics). These changes are then passed on to offspring.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Rosenberg |first1=Eugene |authorlink1=Eugene Rosenberg |last2=Sharon |first2=Gill |last3=Zilber-Rosenberg |first3=Ilana |date=December 2009 |title=The hologenome theory of evolution contains Lamarckian aspects within a Darwinian framework |journal=Environmental Microbiology |volume=11 |issue=12 |pages=2959–2962 |doi=10.1111/j.1462-2920.2009.01995.x |pmid=19573132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The mechanism is largely uncontroversial, and natural selection does sometimes occur at whole system (hologenome) level, but it is not clear that this is always the case.&lt;ref name="Moran Sloan 2015"&gt;{{cite journal | last=Moran | first=Nancy A. | authorlink=Nancy A.

===Baldwin effect===
{{further|Baldwin effect}}
The Baldwin effect, named after the psychologist [[James Mark Baldwin]] by George Gaylord Simpson in 1953, proposes that the ability to learn new behaviours can improve an animal's reproductive success, and hence the course of natural selection on its genetic makeup. Simpson stated that the mechanism was "not inconsistent with the modern synthesis" of evolutionary theory,&lt;ref name="depew03"&gt;Depew, David J. (2003), "Baldwin Boosters, Baldwin Skeptics" in: {{cite book |title=Evolution and learning: The Baldwin effect reconsidered |last=Weber |first=Bruce H. |first2=David J. |last2=Depew |year=2003 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-23229-6 |pages=3–31 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yBtRzBilw1MC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=baldwin+effect#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false }}&lt;/ref&gt; though he doubted that it occurred very often, or could be proven to occur. He noted that the Baldwin effect provide a reconciliation between the neo-Darwinian and neo-Lamarckian approaches, something that the modern synthesis had seemed to render unnecessary. In particular, the effect allows animals to adapt to a new stress in the environment through behavioural changes, followed by genetic change. This somewhat resembles Lamarckism but without requiring animals to inherit characteristics acquired by their parents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=The Baldwin effect |authorlink=George Gaylord Simpson |author=Simpson, George Gaylord |year=1953 |journal=Evolution |volume=7 | issue=2 |pages=110–117 |doi=10.2307/2405746|jstor=2405746 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Baldwin effect is broadly accepted by Darwinists.&lt;ref name="dennett03"&gt;[[Daniel Dennett|Dennett, Daniel]] (2003), "The Baldwin Effect, a Crane, not a Skyhook" in: {{cite book |title=Evolution and learning: The Baldwin effect reconsidered |last=Weber |first=Bruce H. |first2=David J. |last2=Depew |year=2003 |publisher=MIT Press |isbn=978-0-262-23229-6 |pages=69–106 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=yBtRzBilw1MC&amp;pg=PR9&amp;dq=baldwin+effect#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==In sociocultural evolution==

Within the [[history of technology]], Lamarckism has been used in linking cultural development to human evolution by classifying artefacts as extensions of human anatomy: in other words, as the acquired cultural characteristics of human beings. Ben Cullen has shown that a strong element of Lamarckism exists in [[sociocultural evolution]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Cullen|2000|pp=31–60}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{-}}

A '''launch status check''', also known as a "go/no go poll" and several other terms occurs at the beginning of an American spaceflight mission in which [[flight controller]]s monitoring various systems are queried for operation and readiness status before a launch can proceed. For [[Space Shuttle missions]], in the firing room at the [[Launch Control Center]], the NASA Test Director (NTD) performed this check via a voice communications link with other NASA personnel. The NTD was the leader of the shuttle test team responsible for directing and integrating all flight crew, orbiter, external tank/solid rocket booster and ground support testing in the shuttle launch countdown. The NTD was also responsible for the safety of all personnel inside the pad after external tank loading, including the flight crew. He reported to the [[Launch_Control_Center#Launch_Director_.28LD.29|Launch Director]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://science.ksc.nasa.gov/shuttle/countdown/lps/ab/ab.html NASA Web Site: Firing Room Row AB]&lt;/ref&gt; The Launch director declares if a mission is go for launch.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="21929">'''Length measurement''' is implemented in practice in many ways. The most commonly used approaches are the transit-time methods and the interferometer methods based upon the [[speed of light]]. For objects such as crystals and [[diffraction grating]]s, [[diffraction]] is used with [[X-ray]]s and [[electron beam]]s. Measurement techniques for three-dimensional structures very small in every dimension use specialized instruments such as [[Focused ion beam#FIB imaging|ion microscopy]] coupled with intensive computer modeling.

For a discussion of astronomical methods for determining cosmological distances, see the article [[Cosmic distance ladder]].

== Standard rulers ==
The [[ruler]] the simplest kind of length measurement tool: lengths are defined by printed marks or engravings on a stick. The [[meter]] was initially defined using a ruler before more accurate methods became available.

[[Gauge block]]s are a common method for precise measurement or calibration of measurement tools.

For small or microscopic objects, microphotography where the length is calibrated using a graticule can be used. A graticule is a piece that has lines for precise lengths etched into it. Graticules may be fitted into the eyepiece or they may be used on the measurement plane.

==Transit-time measurement==
The basic idea behind a transit-time measurement of length is to send a signal from one end of the length to be measured to the other, and back again. The time for the round trip is the transit time Δt, and the length ℓ is then 2ℓ = Δt*"v",with ''v'' the speed of propagation of the signal, assuming that is the same in both directions. If light is used for the signal, its [[speed of light|speed]] depends upon the medium in which it propagates; in [[SI units]] the speed is a defined value ''c''&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; in the reference medium of [[Vacuum#Electromagnetism|classical vacuum]]. Thus, when light is used in a transit-time approach,  length measurements are not subject to knowledge of the source frequency (apart from possible frequency dependence of the correction to relate the medium to classical vacuum), but are subject to the error in measuring transit times, in particular, errors introduced by the response times of the pulse emission and detection instrumentation. An additional uncertainty is the ''refractive index correction'' relating the medium used to the reference vacuum, taken in SI units to be the [[Vacuum#Electromagnetism|classical vacuum]]. A [[refractive index]] of the medium larger than one slows the light.

Transit-time measurement underlies most radio navigation systems for boats and aircraft, for example, [[radar]] and the nearly obsolete Long Range Aid to Navigation [[LORAN|LORAN-C]]. For example, in one radar system, pulses of electromagnetic radiation are sent out by the vehicle (interrogating pulses) and trigger a response from a ''responder beacon''. The time interval between the sending and the receiving of a pulse is monitored and used to determine a distance. In the [[Global Positioning System|global positioning system]] a code of ones and zeros is emitted at a known time from multiple satellites, and their times of arrival are noted at a receiver along with the time they were sent (encoded in the messages). Assuming the receiver clock can be related to the synchronized clocks on the satellites, the ''transit time'' can be found and used to provide the distance to each satellite. Receiver clock error is corrected by combining the data from four satellites.&lt;ref name= GPS/&gt;

Such techniques vary in accuracy according to the distances over which they are intended for use. For example, LORAN-C is accurate to about {{nowrap|6 km,}} GPS about {{nowrap|10 m,}} enhanced GPS, in which a correction signal is transmitted from terrestrial stations (that is, [[differential GPS]] (DGPS)) or via satellites (that is, [[Wide Area Augmentation System]] (WAAS)) can bring accuracy to a few meters or {{nowrap|&lt; 1 meter,}} or, in specific applications, tens of centimeters. Time-of-flight systems for robotics (for example, Laser Detection and Ranging [[Laser rangefinder|LADAR]] and Light Detection and Ranging [[LIDAR]]) aim at lengths of {{nowrap|10 - 100 m}} and have an accuracy of about {{nowrap|5 – 10 mm}}&lt;ref name=Siciliano/&gt;

==Interferometer measurements==
[[File:Michelson interferometer with corner cubes.png|thumb|Measuring a length in wavelengths of light using an [[interferometer]].]]
In many practical circumstances, and for precision work, measurement of dimension using transit-time measurements is used only as an initial indicator of length and is refined using an interferometer.&lt;ref name=Boyes/&gt;&lt;ref name=Ye/&gt; Generally, transit time measurements are preferred for longer lengths, and interferometers for shorter lengths.&lt;ref name=Yoshizawa/&gt;

The figure shows schematically how length is determined using a [[Michelson interferometer]]: the two panels show a laser source emitting a light beam split by a ''[[beam splitter]]'' (BS) to travel two paths. The light is recombined by bouncing the two components off a pair of ''[[corner cubes]]'' (CC) that return the two components to the beam splitter again to be reassembled. The corner cube serves to displace the incident from the reflected beam, which avoids some complications caused by superposing the two beams.&lt;ref name=CC/&gt; The distance between the left-hand corner cube and the beam splitter is compared to that separation on the fixed leg as the left-hand spacing is adjusted to compare the length of the object to be measured.

In the top panel the path is such that the two beams reinforce each other after reassembly, leading to a strong light pattern (sun). The bottom panel shows a path that is made a half wavelength longer by moving the left-hand mirror a quarter wavelength further away, increasing the path difference by a half wavelength. The result is the two beams are in opposition to each other at reassembly, and the recombined light intensity drops to zero (clouds). Thus, as the spacing between the mirrors is adjusted, the observed light intensity cycles between reinforcement and cancellation as the number of wavelengths of path difference changes, and the observed intensity alternately peaks (bright sun) and dims (dark clouds). This behavior is called [[Interference (wave propagation)|interference]] and the machine is called an [[interferometer]]. By ''counting fringes'' it is found how many wavelengths long the measured path is compared to the fixed leg. In this way, measurements are made in units of wavelengths ''&amp;lambda;'' corresponding to a particular [[Atomic spectral line|atomic transition]]. The length in wavelengths can be converted to a length in units of metres if the selected transition has a known frequency ''f''. The length as a certain number of wavelengths ''&amp;lambda;'' is related to the metre using ''&amp;lambda;'' = {{nowrap|''c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt; / f''}}. With ''c&lt;sub&gt;0&lt;/sub&gt;'' a defined value of 299,792,458&amp;nbsp;m/s, the error in a measured length in wavelengths is increased by this conversion to metres by the error in measuring the frequency of the light source.

By using sources of several wavelengths to generate sum and difference [[Envelope (waves)#Example: Beating waves|beat frequencies]], absolute distance measurements become possible.&lt;ref name=Zheng/&gt;&lt;ref name=Roy/&gt;&lt;ref name=Paul/&gt;

This methodology for length determination requires a careful specification of the wavelength of the light used, and is one reason for employing a [[laser]] source where the wavelength can be held stable.  Regardless of stability, however, the precise frequency of any source has linewidth limitations.&lt;ref name= frequency/&gt; Other significant errors are introduced by the interferometer itself; in particular: errors in light beam alignment, collimation and fractional fringe determination.&lt;ref name=Yoshizawa/&gt;&lt;ref name=errors/&gt; Corrections also are made to account for departures of the medium (for example, air&lt;ref name=air/&gt;) from the reference medium of [[Vacuum#Electromagnetism|classical vacuum]]. Resolution using wavelengths is in the range of ΔL/L ≈ {{nowrap|10&lt;sup&gt;−9&lt;/sup&gt; – 10&lt;sup&gt;−11&lt;/sup&gt;}} depending upon the length measured, the wavelength and the type of interferometer used.&lt;ref name=errors/&gt;

The measurement also requires careful specification of the medium in which the light propagates. A ''refractive index correction'' is made to relate the medium used to the reference vacuum, taken in SI units to be the [[Vacuum#Electromagnetism|classical vacuum]]. These refractive index corrections can be found more accurately by adding frequencies, for example, frequencies at which propagation is sensitive to the presence of water vapor. This way non-ideal contributions to the refractive index can be measured and corrected for at another frequency using established theoretical models.

It may be noted again, by way of contrast, that the transit-time measurement of length is independent of any knowledge of the source frequency, except for a possible dependence of the correction relating the measurement medium to the reference medium of classical vacuum, which may indeed depend on the frequency of the source. Where a pulse train or some other wave-shaping is used, a range of frequencies may be involved.

==Diffraction measurements==
For small objects, different methods are used that also depend upon determining size in units of wavelengths. For instance, in the case of a crystal, atomic spacings can be determined using [[X-ray diffraction]].&lt;ref name=Mohr/&gt;  The present best value for the lattice parameter of silicon, denoted ''a'', is:&lt;ref name=silicon/&gt;

::a = 543.102 0504(89) × 10&lt;sup&gt;−12&lt;/sup&gt; m,

corresponding to a resolution of ΔL/L ≈ {{nowrap|3 × 10&lt;sup&gt;−10&lt;/sup&gt;.}} Similar techniques can provide the dimensions of small structures repeated in large periodic arrays like a [[diffraction grating]].&lt;ref name=grating/&gt;

Such measurements allow the calibration of [[electron microscope]]s, extending measurement capabilities. For non-relativistic electrons in an electron microscope, the [[de Broglie wavelength]] is:&lt;ref name=Spence/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt;\lambda_e = \frac{h}{\sqrt{2m_e e V}} \ , &lt;/math&gt;

with ''V'' the electrical voltage drop traversed by the electron, ''m&lt;sub&gt;e&lt;/sub&gt;'' the electron mass, ''e'' the [[elementary charge]], and ''h'' the [[Planck constant]]. This wavelength can be measured in terms of inter-atomic spacing using a crystal diffraction pattern, and related to the metre through an optical measurement of the lattice spacing on the same crystal. This process of extending calibration is called ''[[metrological traceability]]''.&lt;ref name=traceability&gt;

See {{cite web |title=Metrological traceability |publisher=BIPM |url=http://www.bipm.org/en/bipm/calibrations/traceability.html |accessdate=2011-04-10}}

&lt;/ref&gt; The use of metrological traceability to connect different regimes of measurement is similar to the idea behind the [[cosmic distance ladder]] for different ranges of astronomical length. Both calibrate different methods for length measurement using overlapping ranges of applicability.&lt;ref name=Adams/&gt;

==Other techniques==
Measuring dimensions of localized structures (as opposed to large arrays of atoms like a crystal), as in modern [[integrated circuit]]s, is done using the [[scanning electron microscope]]. This instrument bounces electrons off the object to be measured in a high vacuum enclosure, and the reflected electrons are collected as a photodetector image that is interpreted by a computer. These are not transit-time measurements, but are based upon comparison of [[Fourier transform]]s of images with theoretical results from computer modeling. Such elaborate methods are required because the image depends on the three-dimensional geometry of the measured feature, for example, the contour of an edge, and not just upon one- or two-dimensional properties. The underlying limitations are the beam width and the wavelength of the electron beam (determining [[diffraction]]), determined, as already discussed, by the electron beam energy.&lt;ref name=IC_linewidth&gt;

Postek |editor=Syed Rizvi |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0Smk9-VI1fcC&amp;pg=PA485 |pages=457 ''ff'' |chapter=Photomask critical dimension metrology in the scanning electron microscope |isbn=0-8247-5374-7 |date=2005 |publisher=CRC Press}} and {{cite book |title= Principles of lithography |chapter=Chapter 9: Metrology |author=Harry J.

&lt;/ref&gt; 
The calibration of these scanning electron microscope measurements is tricky, as results depend upon the material measured and its geometry. A typical wavelength is {{nowrap|0.5 Å,}} and a typical resolution is about {{nowrap|4 nm.}}

Other small dimension techniques are the [[atomic force microscope]], the [[focused ion beam]] and the [[helium ion microscope]]. Calibration is attempted using standard samples measured by [[transmission electron microscope]] (TEM).&lt;ref name=Orji&gt;

{{cite journal |title=TEM calibration methods for critical dimension standards |author=NG Orji |url=ftp://129.6.13.25/pub/eeel/cresswell/orji_spie_2007.pdf |date=2007 |journal= Proceedings of SPIE |volume= 6518 |pages=651810 |doi=10.1117/12.713368|author2=and others |displayauthors=1 |series=Metrology, Inspection, and Process Control for Microlithography XXI |last3=Garcia-Gutierrez |last4=Bunday |last5=Bishop |last6=Cresswell |last7=Allen |last8=Allgair |bibcode=2007SPIE.6518E..10O }}

&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Nuclear Overhauser effect]] spectroscopy (NOESY) is a specialized type of [[nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy]] where distances between atoms can be measured. It is based on the effect where nuclear spin cross-relaxation after excitation by a radio pulse depends on the distance between the nuclei. Unlike spin-spin coupling, NOE propagates through space and does not require that the atoms are connected by bonds, so it is a true distance measurement instead of a chemical measurement. Unlike diffraction measurements, NOESY does not require a crystalline sample, but is done in solution state and can be applied to substances that are difficult to crystallize.

==Other systems of units==

In some systems of units, unlike the current SI system, lengths are fundamental units (for example, ''wavelengths'' in the older SI units and ''bohrs'' in [[atomic units]]) and are not defined by times of transit. Even in such units, however, the ''comparison'' of two lengths can be made by comparing the two transit times of light along the lengths. Such time-of-flight methodology may or may not be more accurate than the determination of a length as a multiple of the fundamental length unit.

The corner cube reflects the incident light in a parallel path that is displaced from the beam incident upon the corner cube. That separation of incident and reflected beams reduces some technical difficulties introduced when the incident and reflected beams are on top of each other. For a discussion of this version of the [[Michelson interferometer]] and other types of interferometer, see {{cite book |title=Optical systems and processes |author=Joseph Shamir |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=C7MQjJPcfUQC&amp;pg=PA176 |chapter=§8.7 Using corner cubes |isbn=0-8194-3226-1 |date=1999 |publisher=SPIE Press |pages=176 ''ff''}}

&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;ref name= frequency&gt;
An atomic transition is affected by disturbances, such as collisions with other atoms and frequency shifts from atomic motion due to the [[Doppler effect]], leading to a range of frequencies for the transition referred to as a ''linewidth''. Corresponding to the uncertainty in frequency is an uncertainty in wavelength. In contrast, the speed of light in ideal vacuum is not dependent upon frequency at all.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5801">A '''linear response function''' describes the input-output relationship of a [[signal transducer]] such as a radio turning [[electromagnetic wave]]s into music or a [[neuron]] turning [[Synapse|synaptic]] input into a response. Because of its many applications in [[information theory]], [[physics]] and [[engineering]] there exist alternative names for specific linear response functions such as [[Magnetic susceptibility|susceptibility]], [[impulse response]] or [[Electrical impedance|impedance]], see also [[transfer function]]. The concept of a [[Green's function]] or [[fundamental solution]] of an [[ordinary differential equation]] is closely related.

==Mathematical definition==

Denote the input of a system by &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt; (e.g. a [[force]]), and the response of the system by &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; (e.g. a position). Generally, the value of &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; will depend not only on the present value of &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt;, but also on past values. Approximately &lt;math&gt;x(t)&lt;/math&gt; is a weighted sum of the previous values of &lt;math&gt;h(t')&lt;/math&gt;, with the weights given by the linear response function &lt;math&gt;\chi(t-t')&lt;/math&gt;:

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=\int_{-\infty}^t dt'\, \chi(t-t')h(t')+\dots\,.&lt;/math&gt;

The explicit term on the right-hand side is the [[leading-order|leading order]] term of a [[Volterra series|Volterra expansion]] for the full nonlinear response. If the system in question is highly non-linear, higher order terms in the expansion, denoted by the  dots, become important and the signal transducer cannot adequately be described just by its linear response function.

The complex-valued [[Fourier transform]] &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\chi}(\omega) &lt;/math&gt; of the linear response function is very useful as it describes the output of the system if the input is a sine wave &lt;math&gt;h(t)=h_0\cdot \sin(\omega t)&lt;/math&gt; with frequency &lt;math&gt;\omega&lt;/math&gt;. The output reads

:&lt;math&gt;x(t)=|\tilde{\chi}(\omega)|\cdot h_0 \cdot\sin(\omega t+\arg\tilde{\chi}(\omega))\,,&lt;/math&gt;

with [[Amplifier|amplitude gain]] &lt;math&gt;|\tilde{\chi}(\omega)|&lt;/math&gt; and [[phase shift]] &lt;math&gt;\arg\tilde{\chi}(\omega)&lt;/math&gt;.

==Example==
Consider a [[damped harmonic oscillator]] with input given by an external driving force &lt;math&gt;h(t)&lt;/math&gt;,

:&lt;math&gt;\ddot{x}(t)+\gamma \dot{x}(t)+\omega_0^2 x(t)=h(t). \, &lt;/math&gt;

The complex-valued [[Fourier transform]] of the linear response function is given by

:&lt;math&gt;\tilde{\chi}(\omega) = \frac{\tilde{x}(\omega)}{\tilde{h}(\omega)} = \frac{1}{\omega_0^2-\omega^2+i\gamma\omega}. \, &lt;/math&gt;

The amplitude gain is given by the magnitude of the complex number &lt;math&gt;\tilde\chi (\omega ),&lt;/math&gt; and the phase shift  by the arctan  of the imaginary part of the function, divided by the real one.

From this representation, we see that for small &lt;math&gt;\gamma&lt;/math&gt; the Fourier transform &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\chi}(\omega) &lt;/math&gt; of the linear response function yields a pronounced maximum ("[[Resonance]]") at the frequency &lt;math&gt; \omega\approx\omega_0&lt;/math&gt;. The linear response function for a harmonic oscillator is mathematically identical to that of an [[RLC circuit]].  The width of the maximum &lt;math&gt;,\Delta\omega ,&lt;/math&gt; typically is much smaller than &lt;math&gt;\omega_0 ,&lt;/math&gt; so that the [[Quality factor]] &lt;math&gt;S :=\omega_0 /\Delta\omega&lt;/math&gt; can  be extremely large.

==Kubo formula==
The exposition of linear response theory, in the context of [[quantum statistics]], can be found in a paper by [[Ryogo Kubo]].&lt;ref&gt;Kubo, R., ''Statistical Mechanical Theory of Irreversible Processes I'', Journal of the Physical Society of Japan, vol. ''12'', pp. 570–586 (1957).&lt;/ref&gt;  This defines  particularly the [[Kubo formula]], which considers the general case that the "force" h(t) is a perturbation of the basic  operator of the system, the [[Hamiltonian function|Hamiltonian]], &lt;math&gt;\hat H_0\to \hat{H}_0 -h(t')\hat{B}(t')\, &lt;/math&gt; where &lt;math&gt;\hat B&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to a measurable quantity as input, while the output x(t) is the perturbation of the thermal expectation of another measurable quantity &lt;math&gt;\hat A(t)&lt;/math&gt;. The Kubo formula then defines  the quantum-statistical calculation of the [[susceptibility (disambiguation)|susceptibility]] &lt;math&gt;\chi ( t -t' )&lt;/math&gt; by a general formula involving only the mentioned operators. &lt;!-- It is &lt;math&gt;\chi ( t -t' )= -(i/\hbar )\cdot \langle [\hat{A }(t-t' ),\hat B(0)]\rangle_{\text{thermal expectation}},&lt;/math&gt;  where the brackets mean the thermal expectation value, the expression [...&amp;nbsp;,&amp;nbsp;...] the quantum [[commutator]], and &lt;math&gt;\hat{A(t-t')}&lt;/math&gt; must be evaluated in the quantum-mechanical [[interaction picture]] with the Hamiltonian &lt;math&gt;\hat{H}_0.&lt;/math&gt; --&gt;

As a consequence of the principle of [[Causality (physics)|causality]] the complex-valued function &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\chi }(\omega )&lt;/math&gt; has poles only in the lower half-plane. This leads to the [[Kramers–Kronig relations]],  which relates the real  and the imaginary parts of &lt;math&gt;\tilde{\chi }(\omega )&lt;/math&gt; by integration. The simplest example is once more the [[damped harmonic oscillator]].&lt;ref&gt;De Clozeaux,''Linear Response Theory'', in: E. Antončik et al., ''Theory of condensed matter'', IAEA Vienna, 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

'''MOSAIC threat assessment systems (MOSAIC)''' is a method developed by [[Gavin de Becker and Associates]] in the early 1980s to assess and screen [[threats]] and inappropriate communications.

Walt Risler of [[Indiana University]] assisted in the early development of the method, and Robert Martin, founding commander of the [[Los Angeles Police Department]] Threat Management Unit played a role in later development and enhancements. (Martin now heads up the MOSAIC threat assessment Unit at Gavin de Becker &amp; Associates.)

The first MOSAIC systems were developed before 1992. The computer-assisted MOSAIC method is now used by the [[Supreme Court Police]] to assess threats to the Justices, by the [[U.S. Capitol Police]] for threats against Members of [[United States Congress|Congress]], by police agencies protecting the governors of eleven states, by many large corporations, and by more than twenty top universities.

There are different MOSAIC systems for different situations, including:

* Threats and fear in the workplace
* Threats by students
* Threats against judges and other judicial officials
* Threats against public figures and public officials
* Domestic abuse situations

The MOSAIC method poses a series of questions to users, accompanied by a range of possible answers.  For every area of inquiry, the system provides a button for “Premise of the Question” – providing immediate on-screen research citations about why that particular area of inquiry is part of the assessment process.  MOSAIC calculates the value of the answers selected by the assessor, and expresses the results on a scale of 1 to 10.  Unlike most assessment tools, many of which are paper checklists, MOSAIC automatically produces a full written report, describing the factors that were considered and the selections made by the user.

MOSAIC’s on-line resources include a library of research, publications, and training videos that users can access during an assessment.

==Types of MOSAIC==

===MOSAIC – public figures (MAPP)===
MOSAIC for assessing unwanted pursuit of public figures (MAPP) is used by agencies protecting elected and appointed officials, national security agencies, and iconic public figures.

Lieutenant Tom Taylor, four-time president of the National Governor’s Security Association, wrote for the Institute of Police Technology and Management:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
The consistent way in which MOSAIC methodically guides an evaluation and documents the findings is what sets it apart. In fact, since it places less emphasis on the presence (or lack) of a direct threat, as well as any denials of intent that are uttered in an interview, MOSAIC forces the investigator to look at all of the factors present in the situation.&lt;ref name="dodgingbullets"&gt;Taylor, Tom.  (2000).  Dodging Bullets: A Strategic Guide to World-Class Protection.  [http://www.iptm.org/ Institute of Police Technology and Management].&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===MOSAIC – judicial officials (MAJ)===
In the mid-nineties, Ted Calhoun of the [[United States Marshals Service]] undertook a research project about threats and attacks on federal judges. He studied and analyzed more than 3,000 cases of threats against Federal judges and prosecutors. Calhoun felt that these threats – often made by people whose lives were directly affected by the court – were inherently different from threats to other public figures, with whom the threateners rarely had any real contact.

The marshal's service selected the MOSAIC method for applying Calhoun’s research, and Gavin de Becker &amp; Associates was commissioned to co-develop a new system: MOSAIC for Assessment of Threats to Judges (MAJ).

The book ''Hunters and Howlers: Threats &amp; Violence Against Federal Judicial Officials'' describes the method that evolved into this MOSAIC:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
By drawing as complete a mosaic of the threatened and each of his inappropriate communications as possible, de Becker’s system identifies those situations requiring a defensive reaction or a proactive response.  The problem is thus managed to the best and least intrusive protection of the victim. The whole approach is informed by an intelligent, comprehensive process of thinking. De Becker’s assessments are the best because he asks the most comprehensive questions, and he consistently asks them of every communication. To do fewer risks more.&lt;ref name="hunters"&gt;Calhoun, Frederick S. (February 1998).  Hunters and Howlers: Threats and Violence Against Federal Judicial Officials in the United States.  ''[[United States Marshals Service]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

A variation of MAJ is now used by Sheriff’s Deputies, bailiffs, and others tasked to protect judges and other judicial officials.

===MOSAIC – domestic violence (DV-MOSAIC)===
DV - MOSAIC assesses situations involving domestic violence.  As of April 2010, DV - MOSAIC is available at no-cost to the public at [http://www.mosaicmethod.com www.mosaicmethod.com].

A study funded by the U.S. Department of Justice and published by the National Criminal Justice Reference Service found that when compared to two specific instruments, the Domestic Violence Screening Instrument (DSVI) and the Kingston Screening Instrument for Domestic Violence (K-SID), DV - MOSAIC “performed best in predicting subsequent stalking or threats.”  The study also reported that MOSAIC tested highest on “sensitivity,” correctly classifying most of the women that were re-assaulted; had the strongest correlation between the victims’ perception of risk of re-assault and risk of serious harm; captured relevant information equally well with victims of various ethnicities; had scores that were significantly associated with abuse; and provided uniformity of assessment (called Inter-rater Reliability) such that ten different people of different abilities and styles would come up with the same preliminary rating.&lt;ref name="study"&gt;Roehl, Janice Ph.D.; O’Sullivan, Chris Ph.D.; Webster, Daniel ScD; and Campbell Jacquelyn, Ph.D.  (May 2005).  [https://www.mosaicmethod.com/documents/DOJ_Study.pdf Intimate Partner Violence Risk Assessment Validation Study].  ''[[U.S. Department of Justice]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

A synopsis of the findings is available at https://www.mosaicmethod.com/documents/DOJ_Study.pdf.

The study has also been published by the University of Wisconsin-Madison,&lt;ref name="Wisconsin"&gt;University of Wisconsin - Madison Libraries [http://search.library.wisc.edu/catalog/ocn789282109]''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Journal of Interpersonal Violence,&lt;ref name="Violence"&gt;The Journal of Interpersonal Violence [http://jiv.sagepub.com/content/28/7/1537.abstract]''.&lt;/ref&gt; the United Nations Entity for Gender Equity,&lt;ref name="Gender Equity"&gt;United Nations Entity for Gender Equality and the Empowerment of Women [http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/1088-risk-assessment.html]''.&lt;/ref&gt; and the Violence Against Women Network.&lt;ref name= "Violence Women"&gt;The Violence Against Women Network. [http://www.vawnet.org/special-collections/DVHomicide.php]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

DV-MOSAIC is used by many police departments around the nation.&lt;ref name="latimes"&gt;Johnson, Tracy.  (October 21, 1996).  Software Assess the Likelihood of Violence in Home. ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt;
“MOSAIC is proving successful. In the suburbs of Los Angeles where it is used, officials attribute much of the 70% decline in domestic violence to the system.&lt;ref name="LA"&gt;ABC NEWS/Discovery [http://gavindebecker.com/files/careers/MOSAIC_SRG.pdf]''.&lt;/ref&gt;"
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Robert Ressler]], a criminologist who worked in the FBI's Behavioral Sciences Unit for 16 years, has referred federal agencies to de Becker. “It has a futuristic ability to predict crime and has a proven track record," Ressler said. "You can predict a crime and deal with a potential situation based on a reading from a database. It will help law enforcement deal with situations successfully.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1996-10-21/local/me-56247_1_domestic-violence |title=Software Assesses Likelihood of Violence in Home |publisher=Los Angeles Times |first=Tracy |last=Johnson |date=October 21, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;"

===MOSAIC – workplace violence (MAT-W)===
MOSAIC – workplace violence assesses the three most likely sources of violence in the workplace: angry employees, angry former employees, and stalkers who pursue their targets at the workplace.

The development of this MOSAIC was guided by an Advisory Board of experts and practitioners from industry, government, and law enforcement.

This version of MOSAIC is used by professionals in security departments, legal departments, and human resources offices of large organizations, government agencies, and universities.

===MOSAIC for assessment of threats by students (MAST)===
The development of MOSAIC for threats by students (MAST) included an exploration into the pre-incident indicators of explosive school violence.  The process drew on more than two hundred experts and practitioners from the fields of education, counseling, psychology, parenting, [[threat assessment]], law enforcement, the judiciary, and students.

The MAST is used by school administrators, counselors, and security/law enforcement officers.

In 1997, Chief James Perrotti of the [[Yale University]] police stated that the department used MOSAIC for assessing threats made to Yale professors. He stated that MOSAIC allowed police to prioritize cases and better allocate their resources.&lt;ref name="yale"&gt;Sachsman, Susanne (September 8, 1997). Prof Stalkers Beware: MOSAIC is here.  ''[Yale News]''.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, the Missouri Campus Task Force report to the Governor of Missouri on campus security and violence prevention included the recommendation that “Each institution should thoroughly evaluate the viability and appropriateness of using assessment tools (e.g. MOSAIC) designed to identify individuals with the potential for violent behavior.&lt;ref name="missouri"&gt;Missouri Campus Task Force.  (August 21, 2007).  [https://www.mosaicmethod.com/documents/missouri_report.pdf Security Our Future: Making Colleges and Universities Safe Places to Learn and Grow].  Missouri Department of Higher Education.&lt;/ref&gt;"

The Superintendent of the L.A. County Office of Education said about MOSAIC: “This is not something where I call you in and give you the third degree. I give myself the third degree because parents want to know why. It just can't be, ‘I don't like your child, I don't like what he does, and I can't explain why.’ This is bringing us to a higher level.&lt;ref name="Dr. Don"&gt;Dr. Don Ingwerson, Superintendent of the L.A.

In April 2010, [[Oprah Winfrey]] dedicated an hour-long show to applying the MOSAIC method to domestic violence situations. It was announced on the show that Gavin de Becker was making MOSAIC available to anyone at no cost.  Tens of thousands of audience members accessed MOSAIC within the first two weeks, and this MOSAIC remains available to anyone today at no cost at [http://www.oprah.com www.oprah.com] or [http://www.mosaicmethod.com www.mosaicmethod.com].&lt;ref name="oprah"&gt;[[The Oprah Winfrey Show]] (April 16, 2010). [[Gavin de Becker]].&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversy about MOSAIC==
In an article on the method, psychologist Hill Walker, a professor at the University of Oregon who had studied behavioral disorders in schoolchildren for 34 years told Wired Magazine, "There are some serious validity issues here, some reputation-ruining implications.&lt;ref name="wired"&gt;Forrest, Brett (June 2000). [https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.06/mustread.html?pg=5 UltraViolencePredictor 1.0.] ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''&lt;/ref&gt;" The developers note that Hill Walker has never seen or used a MOSAIC system, and was commenting on the idea or concept, not the actual method. In a letter to the editor following publication of the article, de Becker wrote that MOSAIC for Assessment of Student Threats (MAST) “is the opposite of profiling in that it is always applied to an actual known individual, and it always explores actual behavior and circumstance.&lt;ref name="debecker"&gt;de Becker, Gavin (September 2000). [https://www.wired.com/wired/archive/8.09/rants.html Rants &amp; Raves.] ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

In an editorial, Professor [[Laurence Steinberg]] (who had never seen MOSAIC) questioned the value of the method for predicting violence:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
In a nation of 90,000 schools, trying to pick out the dozen or so students a year who might commit murder is like looking for a needle in a haystack the size of Kansas 
.&lt;ref name="NYTSteinberg"&gt;Steinberg, Laurence.  (April 22, 2000).  Software Can't Make School Safe. ''[[New York Times]]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

De Becker responded that MOSAIC for Assessment of Student Threats (MAST) is never applied to the general population of students, and rather just to those students who self-identify by making a threat.&lt;ref name="de Becker"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/05/05/opinion/l-threats-in-school-103098.html |title=Threats in School |publisher=New York Times |first=Gavin |last=de Becker |date=May 5, 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The NY Times published a letter by de Becker, commenting on Professor Steinberg's editorial.&lt;ref name="de Becker"/&gt;

==Additional Information and Comments Regarding MOSAIC==
* In 2007, the London Times reported that the city of Croyden had adopted the DV-MOSAIC model in conjunction with the co-located services approach developed by the Family Justice Center in San Diego.&lt;ref name="London"&gt;The London Times (2007) [http://themaddiecasefiles.com/topic2188.html]''.&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 2001, an article in Sheriff Magazine by Dr. Frederick Calhoun stated: “Although originally designed for assessing threats to Federal judicial officials, MOSAIC's assessments are relevant to all aspects of the judicial setting.&lt;ref name="Calhoun"&gt;Sheriff Magazine (2001) [https://www.ncjrs.gov/App/publications/Abstract.aspx?id=189301]''.&lt;/ref&gt;"
* In 2000, officials from the CIA, Yale University Police Department, the U.S. Capitol Police, the Administrative Office of the United States Courts, the U.S. Marshals Service, the California Highway Patrol, and other experts participated in a comprehensive review of the MOSAIC used for assessment of threats to public figures, and an updated system emerged, now known as the MOSAIC for Assessment of Public-figure Pursuit (MAPP).
* In 2000, the State of California convened a group of experts to study the domestic violence MOSAIC, and suggested changes and enhancements. This led to the development of a special MOSAIC called CAL-MOSAIC which the California Commission on Peace Officer Standards and Training (POST) provided at no cost to each of the State’s 600+ police departments.&lt;ref name="POST"&gt;''Commission on Peace Officers Standards and Training''[http://post.ca.gov/]''&lt;/ref&gt;
* In 1999, the Los Angeles and Chicago school districts participated in a project to develop a MOSAIC specially designed for assessing threats made by students.  Paul Vallas, Superintendent of Chicago Schools, said at a press conference, "Our schools need to avoid overreacting to threats that aren't substantial, and this system can help them in this respect. We can't be afraid of new technology, we can't be afraid of new approaches. Violence is a fact of life across this country, and we need to equip our principals with the analytical tools to make accurate calls as to which services and intervention support to make available to their students.&lt;ref name="Vallas"&gt;Paul Vallas, Superintendent of Chicago Schools [http://gavindebecker.com/files/careers/MOSAIC_SRG.pdf]''.&lt;/ref&gt;"
* In 1998, MOSAIC was selected by the National Victim Center as one of the “Top Ten Most Promising Strategies and Practices in Using Technology to Benefit Victims.”
* U.S. Attorney General Meese and FBI Director Webster presented a special award to Gavin de Becker for “Outstanding work in developing a [[threat assessment]] model that has been of great assistance to law enforcement and criminal justice agencies.&lt;ref name="Award"&gt;U.S Attorney General Meese &amp; FBI Director Webster  [http://gavindebecker.com/files/careers/MOSAIC_SRG.pdf]''.&lt;/ref&gt;"
* Los Angeles County Law enforcement agencies adopted MOSAIC in 1997 to help police manage and reduce spousal abuse cases that might escalate to homicide.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1997-02-05/local/me-25642_1_domestic-violence |title= Software Aids Battle Against Home Violence |publisher=Los Angeles Times |first=Julie |last=Tamaki |date=February 5, 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[multilinear algebra]], a '''multivector''', sometimes called '''Clifford number''',&lt;ref&gt;John Snygg (2012), ''A New Approach to Differential Geometry Using Clifford’s Geometric Algebra'', Birkhäuser, p.5 §2.12&lt;/ref&gt; is an element of the [[exterior algebra]] {{math|Λ(''V'')}} of a [[vector space]] {{mvar|V}}. This algebra is [[graded algebra|graded]], [[associative algebra|associative]] and [[alternating algebra|alternating]], and consists of [[linear combination]]s of '''simple''' {{math|''k''}}-vectors (also known as '''decomposable''' {{math|''k''}}-vectors or [[Blade (geometry)|{{math|''k''}}-blades]]) of the form
:&lt;math&gt; v_1\wedge\cdots\wedge v_k,&lt;/math&gt;
where &lt;math&gt;v_1, \ldots, v_k&lt;/math&gt; are in {{mvar|V}}.

"Multivector" may mean either ''homogeneous'' elements (all terms of the linear combination have the same grade or degree {{math|''k''}}, that is are the product of the same number {{math|''k''}} of vectors), which are referred to as '''{{math|''k''}}-vectors''' or '''{{math|''p''}}-vectors''',&lt;ref&gt;Élie Cartan, ''The theory of spinors'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=AEZ1h7Cg3cwC&amp;pg=PA16&amp;dq=p-vector+multivectors p. 16], considers only homogeneous vectors, particularly simple ones, referring to them as "multivectors" (collectively) or ''p''-vectors (specifically).&lt;/ref&gt; or may allow sums of terms in different degrees.

In [[differential geometry]], a '''{{math|''p''}}-vector''' is the antisymmetric [[tensor]] obtained by taking [[linear combination]]s of the [[wedge product]] of {{math|''p''}} [[tangent vector]]s, for some integer {{math|''p'' ≥ 0}}. It is the [[Dual space|dual]] concept to a [[p-form|{{math|''p''}}-form]].

For {{math|1=''p'' = 0, 1, 2}} and {{math|3}}, these are often called respectively ''[[Scalar (mathematics)|scalar]]s'', ''vectors'', ''[[bivector]]s'' and ''trivectors''; they are respectively dual to [[0-form]]s, [[1-form]]s, [[2-form]]s and 3-forms.&lt;ref name="Ławrynowicz"&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt;

==Wedge product==
{{Main|Exterior algebra}}

The wedge product operation used to construct multivectors is linear, associative and alternating, which reflect the properties of the determinant. This means for vectors '''u''', '''v''' and '''w''' in a vector space ''V'' and for scalars ''α'', ''β'', the wedge product has the properties,

* Linear:  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}\wedge(\alpha\mathbf{v}+\beta\mathbf{w})=\alpha\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}+\beta\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{w};&lt;/math&gt;
* Associative:  &lt;math&gt; (\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v})\wedge\mathbf{w}=\mathbf{u}\wedge(\mathbf{v}\wedge\mathbf{w})=\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}\wedge\mathbf{w};&lt;/math&gt;
* Alternating:  &lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}=-\mathbf{v}\wedge\mathbf{u}, \quad\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{u}=0.&lt;/math&gt;

The product of ''p'' vectors is called a grade ''p'' multivector, or a ''p''-vector.  The maximum grade of a multivector is the dimension of the vector space ''V''.

The linearity of the wedge product allows a multivector to be defined as the linear combination of basis multivectors.  There are &lt;big&gt;(&lt;/big&gt;{{su|p=''n''|b=''p''}}&lt;big&gt;)&lt;/big&gt; basis ''p''-vectors in an ''n''-dimensional vector space.&lt;ref name="Flanders"&gt;H. Flanders, ''Differential Forms with Applications to the Physical Sciences, Academic Press, New York, NY, 1963&lt;/ref&gt;

==Area and volume==
The ''p''-vector obtained from the wedge product of ''p'' separate vectors in an ''n''-dimensional space has components that define the projected {{nowrap|(''p'' − 1)}}-volumes of the ''p''-[[Parallelepiped#Parallelotope|parallelotope]] spanned by the vectors.  The square root of the sum of the squares of these components defines the volume of the ''p''-parallelotope.&lt;ref name="Flanders"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;G. E. Shilov, ''Linear Algebra'', (trans. R. A. Silverman), Dover Publications, 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

The following examples show that a bivector in two dimensions measures the area of a parallelogram, and the magnitude of a bivector in three dimensions also measures the area of a parallelogram.  Similarly, a three-vector in three dimensions measures the volume of a parallelepiped.

It is easy to check that the magnitude of a three-vector in four dimensions measures the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by these vectors.

===Multivectors in R&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;===
Properties of multivectors can be seen by considering the two dimensional vector space {{nowrap|1=''V'' = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  Let the basis vectors be '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, so '''u''' and '''v''' are given by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}=u_1\mathbf{e}_1+u_2\mathbf{e}_2,\quad \mathbf{v}=v_1\mathbf{e}_1+v_2\mathbf{e}_2,&lt;/math&gt;

and the multivector {{nowrap|'''u''' ∧ '''v'''}}, also called a bivector, is computed to be

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v} =\begin{vmatrix} u_1 &amp; v_1 \\ u_2 &amp; v_2\end{vmatrix} \mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_2.&lt;/math&gt;

The vertical bars denote the determinant of the matrix, which is the area of the parallelogram spanned by the vectors '''u''' and '''v'''.  The magnitude of {{nowrap|'''u''' ∧ '''v'''}} is the area of this parallelogram.  Notice that because ''V'' has dimension two the basis bivector {{nowrap|'''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;}} is the only multivector in Λ''V''.

The relationship between the magnitude of a multivector and the area or volume spanned by the vectors is an important feature in all dimensions.  Furthermore, the linear functional version of a multivector that computes this volume is known as a differential form.

===Multivectors in R&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;===
More features of multivectors can be seen by considering the three dimensional vector space {{nowrap|1=''V'' = '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;}}.  In this case, let the basis vectors be '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, and '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;3&lt;/sub&gt;, so '''u''', '''v''' and '''w''' are given by

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}=u_1\mathbf{e}_1+u_2\mathbf{e}_2 +u_3\mathbf{e}_3 ,\quad \mathbf{v}=v_1\mathbf{e}_1+v_2\mathbf{e}_2+v_3\mathbf{e}_3, \quad \mathbf{w}=w_1\mathbf{e}_1+w_2\mathbf{e}_2+w_3\mathbf{e}_3,&lt;/math&gt;

and the bivector {{nowrap|'''u''' ∧ '''v'''}} is computed to be

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u} \wedge \mathbf{v} =\begin{vmatrix} u_2 &amp; v_2 \\ u_3 &amp; v_3\end{vmatrix} \mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_3 + \begin{vmatrix} u_1 &amp; v_1 \\ u_3 &amp; v_3\end{vmatrix} \mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_3 +\begin{vmatrix} u_1 &amp; v_1 \\ u_2 &amp; v_2\end{vmatrix} \mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_2.&lt;/math&gt;

The components of this bivector are the same as the components of the cross product.  The magnitude of this bivector is the square root of the sum of the squares of its components.

This shows that the magnitude of the bivector {{nowrap|'''u''' ∧ '''v'''}} is the area of the parallelogram spanned by the vectors '''u''' and '''v''' as it lies in the three-dimensional space ''V''.  The components of the bivector are the projected areas of the parallelogram on each of the three coordinate planes.

Notice that because ''V'' has dimension three, there is one basis three-vector in Λ''V''.  Compute the three-vector
:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{u}\wedge\mathbf{v}\wedge\mathbf{w}=\begin{vmatrix} u_1 &amp; v_1 &amp;w_1\\ u_2 &amp; v_2&amp; w_2\\u_3&amp;v_3&amp;w_3\end{vmatrix} \mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_3. &lt;/math&gt;
This shows that the magnitude of the three-vector {{nowrap|'''u''' ∧ '''v''' ∧ '''w'''}} is the volume of the parallelepiped spanned by the three vectors '''u''', '''v''' and '''w'''.

In higher-dimensional spaces, the component three-vectors are projections of the volume of a parallelepiped onto the coordinate three-spaces, and the magnitude of the three-vector is the volume of the parallelepiped as it sits in the higher-dimensional space.

==Grassmann coordinates==
In this section, we consider multivectors on a [[projective space]] ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, which provide a convenient set of coordinates for lines, planes and hyperplanes that have properties similar to the homogeneous coordinates of points, called [[Grassmann coordinates]].&lt;ref&gt;W. V. D. Hodge and D. Pedoe, Methods of Algebraic Geometry, Vol. 1, Cambridge Univ. Press, 1947&lt;/ref&gt;

Points in a real projective space ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; are defined to be lines through the origin of the vector space '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt;.  For example, the projective plane ''P''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; is the set of lines through the origin of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.  Thus, multivectors defined on '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; can be viewed as multivectors on ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.

A convenient way to view a multivector on ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt; is to examine it in an [[affine space|affine component]] of ''P''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;, which is the intersection of the lines through the origin of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sup&gt; with a selected hyperplane, such as {{nowrap|1=H: ''x''&lt;sub&gt;''n''+1&lt;/sub&gt; = 1}}.  Lines through the origin of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; intersect the plane {{nowrap|1=E: ''z'' = 1}} to define an affine version of the projective plane that only lacks the points {{nowrap|1=''z'' = 0}}, called the points at infinity.

===Multivectors on ''P''&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;===
Points in the affine component {{nowrap|1=E: ''z'' = 1}} of the projective plane have coordinates {{nowrap|1='''x''' = (''x'', ''y'', 1)}}.  A linear combination of two points {{nowrap|1='''p''' = (''p''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''p''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1)}} and {{nowrap|1='''q''' = (''q''&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;, ''q''&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;, 1)}} defines a plane in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; that intersects E in the line joining '''p''' and '''q'''.  The multivector {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q'''}} defines a parallelogram in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; given by
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{p} \wedge \mathbf{q} =(p_2 - q_2)\mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_3 + (p_1- q_1) \mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_3 +(p_1 q_2-  q_1 p_2)\mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_2.&lt;/math&gt;
Notice that substitution of {{nowrap|''α'''''p''' + ''β'''''q'''}} for '''p''' multiplies this multivector by a constant.  Therefore, the components of {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q'''}} are homogeneous coordinates for the plane through the origin of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;.

The set of points {{nowrap|1='''x''' = (''x'', ''y'', 1)}} on the line through '''p''' and '''q''' is the intersection of the plane defined by {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q'''}}  with the plane {{nowrap|1=E: ''z'' = 1}}.  These points satisfy {{nowrap|1='''x''' ∧ '''p''' ∧ '''q''' = 0}}, that is,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{p} \wedge \mathbf{q} = (x\mathbf{e}_1+y\mathbf{e}_2+\mathbf{e}_3)\wedge \big( (p_2 - q_2)\mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_3 + (p_1- q_1) \mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_3 +(p_1 q_2-  q_1 p_2)\mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_2\big)=0,&lt;/math&gt;

which simplifies to the equation of a line

:&lt;math&gt;  \lambda:  x(p_2 - q_2) + y(p_1- q_1)+ (p_1 q_2- q_1 p_2)=0.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is satisfied by points {{nowrap|1='''x''' = ''α'''''p''' + ''β'''''q'''}} for real values of α and β.

The three components of {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q'''}} that define the line ''λ'' are called the [[Grassmann coordinates]] of the line.  Because three homogeneous coordinates define both a point and a line, the geometry of points is said to be dual to the geometry of lines in the projective plane.  This is called the [[duality (projective geometry)|principle of duality]].

===Multivectors on ''P''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt;===
Three dimensional projective space, ''P''&lt;sup&gt;3&lt;/sup&gt; consists of all lines through the origin of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.  Let the three dimensional hyperplane, {{nowrap|1=H: ''w'' = 1}}, be the affine component of projective space defined by the points {{nowrap|1='''x''' = (''x'', ''y'', ''z'', 1)}}.  The multivector {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q''' ∧ '''r'''}} defines a parallelepiped in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt; given by

:&lt;math&gt;\mathbf{p}\wedge\mathbf{q}\wedge\mathbf{r}=\begin{vmatrix} p_2 &amp; q_2 &amp;r_2\\ p_3 &amp; q_3&amp; r_3\\1&amp;1&amp;1\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_3\wedge\mathbf{e}_4 + \begin{vmatrix} p_1 &amp; q_1 &amp;r_1\\ p_3 &amp; q_3&amp; r_3\\1&amp;1&amp;1\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_3\wedge\mathbf{e}_4 + \begin{vmatrix} p_1 &amp; q_1 &amp;r_1\\ p_2 &amp; q_2&amp; r_2\\1&amp;1&amp;1\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_4 + \begin{vmatrix} p_1 &amp; q_1 &amp;r_1\\ p_2 &amp; q_2&amp; r_2\\ p_3 &amp; q_3&amp; r_3\end{vmatrix} \mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_3. &lt;/math&gt;

Notice that substitution of {{nowrap|α'''p''' + β'''q''' + γ'''r'''}} for '''p''' multiplies this multivector by a constant.  Therefore, the components of {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q''' ∧ '''r'''}}  are homogeneous coordinates for the 3-space through the origin of '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.

A plane in the affine component {{nowrap|1=H: ''w'' = 1}} is the set of points {{nowrap|1='''x''' = (''x'', ''y'', ''z'', 1)}} in the intersection of H with the 3-space defined by {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q''' ∧ '''r'''}}.  These points satisfy {{nowrap|1='''x''' ∧ '''p''' ∧ '''q''' ∧ '''r''' = 0}}, that is,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{x}\wedge\mathbf{p} \wedge \mathbf{q}\wedge\mathbf{r} = (x\mathbf{e}_1+y\mathbf{e}_2+z\mathbf{e}_3 +\mathbf{e}_4)\wedge \mathbf{p}\wedge\mathbf{q}\wedge\mathbf{r} = 0 ,&lt;/math&gt;

which simplifies to the equation of a plane

:&lt;math&gt;  \lambda:  x\begin{vmatrix} p_2 &amp; q_2 &amp;r_2\\ p_3 &amp; q_3&amp; r_3\\1&amp;1&amp;1\end{vmatrix} + y \begin{vmatrix} p_1 &amp; q_1 &amp;r_1\\ p_3 &amp; q_3&amp; r_3\\1&amp;1&amp;1\end{vmatrix}+ z\begin{vmatrix} p_1 &amp; q_1 &amp;r_1\\ p_2 &amp; q_2&amp; r_2\\1&amp;1&amp;1\end{vmatrix}+  \begin{vmatrix} p_1 &amp; q_1 &amp;r_1\\ p_2 &amp; q_2&amp; r_2\\ p_3 &amp; q_3&amp; r_3\end{vmatrix} =0.&lt;/math&gt;

This equation is satisfied by points {{nowrap|1='''x''' = ''α'''''p''' + ''β'''''q''' + ''γ'''''r'''}} for real values of ''α'', ''β'' and ''γ''.

The four components of {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q''' ∧ '''r'''}} that define the plane ''λ'' are called the [[Grassmann coordinates]] of the plane.  Because four homogeneous coordinates define both a point and a plane in projective space, the geometry of points is dual to the geometry of planes.

'''A line as the join of two points:''' In projective space the line ''λ'' through two points '''p''' and '''q''' can be viewed as the intersection of the affine space {{nowrap|1=H: ''w'' = 1}} with the plane {{nowrap|1='''x''' = ''α'''''p''' + ''β'''''q'''}}  in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;4&lt;/sup&gt;.  The multivector {{nowrap|'''p''' ∧ '''q'''}} provides homogeneous coordinates for the line

:&lt;math&gt; \lambda:  \mathbf{p} \wedge \mathbf{q} = (p_1\mathbf{e}_1+p_2\mathbf{e}_2+p_3\mathbf{e}_3 +\mathbf{e}_4)\wedge  (q_1\mathbf{e}_1+q_2\mathbf{e}_2+q_3\mathbf{e}_3 +\mathbf{e}_4),&lt;/math&gt;
:&lt;math&gt;\qquad =\begin{vmatrix} p_1 &amp; q_1\\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_4 + \begin{vmatrix} p_2 &amp; q_2\\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_4 + \begin{vmatrix} p_3 &amp; q_3\\ 1 &amp; 1 \end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_3\wedge\mathbf{e}_4+ \begin{vmatrix} p_2 &amp; q_2\\ p_3 &amp; q_3 \end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_3+\begin{vmatrix} p_3 &amp; q_3\\ p_1 &amp; q_1 \end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_3\wedge\mathbf{e}_1+\begin{vmatrix} p_1 &amp; q_1\\ p_2 &amp; q_2\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_2.&lt;/math&gt;
These are known as the [[Plücker coordinates]] of the line, though they are also an example of Grassmann coordinates.

'''A line as the intersection of two planes:'''  A line ''μ'' in projective space can also be defined as the set of points '''x''' that form the intersection of two planes ''π'' and ''ρ'' defined by grade three multivectors, so the points '''x''' are the solutions to the linear equations

:&lt;math&gt;  \mu: \mathbf{x}\wedge \pi = 0, \mathbf{x}\wedge \rho = 0.&lt;/math&gt;

In order to obtain the Plucker coordinates of the line ''μ'', map the multivectors ''π'' and ''ρ'' to their dual point coordinates using the [[Hodge star operator]],&lt;ref name="Flanders"/&gt;

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_1 = {\star}(\mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_3 \wedge\mathbf{e}_4), -\mathbf{e}_2 = {\star}(\mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_3 \wedge\mathbf{e}_4), \mathbf{e}_3 = {\star}(\mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_2 \wedge\mathbf{e}_4), -\mathbf{e}_4 = {\star}(\mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_2 \wedge\mathbf{e}_3),&lt;/math&gt;

then

:&lt;math&gt; {\star}\pi = \pi_1\mathbf{e}_1 + \pi_2\mathbf{e}_2 + \pi_3\mathbf{e}_3 + \pi_4\mathbf{e}_4, \quad {\star}\rho = \rho_1\mathbf{e}_1 + \rho_2\mathbf{e}_2 + \rho_3\mathbf{e}_3 + \rho_4\mathbf{e}_4 .&lt;/math&gt;

So, the Plücker coordinates of the line ''μ'' are given by

:&lt;math&gt; \mu: ({\star}\pi)\wedge({\star}\rho) =\begin{vmatrix} \pi_1 &amp; \rho_1\\ \pi_4 &amp; \rho_4 \end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_4 + \begin{vmatrix} \pi_2 &amp; \rho_2\\ \pi_4 &amp; \rho_4 \end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_4 + \begin{vmatrix} \pi_3 &amp; \rho_3\\ \pi_4 &amp; \rho_4\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_3\wedge\mathbf{e}_4+ \begin{vmatrix}  \pi_2 &amp; \rho_2\\ \pi_3 &amp; \rho_3\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_2\wedge\mathbf{e}_3+\begin{vmatrix}  \pi_3 &amp; \rho_3\\ \pi_1 &amp; \rho_1\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_3\wedge\mathbf{e}_1+\begin{vmatrix}  \pi_1 &amp; \rho_1\\ \pi_2 &amp; \rho_2\end{vmatrix}\mathbf{e}_1\wedge\mathbf{e}_2.&lt;/math&gt;

Because the six homogeneous coordinates of a line can be obtained from the join of two points or the intersection of two planes, the line is said to be self dual in projective space.

==Clifford product==
[[William Kingdon Clifford|W. K. Clifford]] combined multivectors with the [[inner product]] defined on the vector space, in order to obtain a general construction for hypercomplex numbers that includes the usual complex numbers and Hamilton's [[quaternion]]s.&lt;ref&gt;W. K. Clifford, "Preliminary sketch of bi-quaternions," Proc. London Math. Soc. Vol. 4 (1873) pp. 381-395&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;W. K. Clifford, ''Mathematical Papers'', (ed. R. Tucker), London: Macmillan, 1882.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Clifford product between two vectors '''u''' and '''v''' is linear and associative like the wedge product, and has the additional property that the multivector '''uv''' is coupled to the inner product {{nowrap|'''u''' · '''v'''}} by Clifford's relation,
:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{u}\mathbf{v} + \mathbf{v}\mathbf{u} = 2\mathbf{u}\cdot\mathbf{v}.&lt;/math&gt;

Clifford's relation preserves the alternating property for the product of vectors that are perpendicular.  This can be seen for the orthogonal unit vectors {{nowrap|1='''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt;, ''i'' = 1, ..., ''n''}} in '''R'''&lt;sup&gt;''n''&lt;/sup&gt;.  Clifford's relation yields

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_i\mathbf{e}_j + \mathbf{e}_j\mathbf{e}_i = 2\mathbf{e}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_j = 0, &lt;/math&gt;

therefore the basis vectors are alternating,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_i\mathbf{e}_j = -  \mathbf{e}_j\mathbf{e}_i, \quad i\neq j = 1, \ldots, n.&lt;/math&gt;

In contrast to the wedge product, the Clifford product of a vector with itself is no longer zero.  To see this compute the product,

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_i\mathbf{e}_i +  \mathbf{e}_i\mathbf{e}_i = 2 \mathbf{e}_i\cdot\mathbf{e}_i = 2,&lt;/math&gt;

which yields

:&lt;math&gt; \mathbf{e}_i\mathbf{e}_i = 1,\quad i=1,\ldots, n.&lt;/math&gt;

The set of multivectors constructed using Clifford's product yields an associative algebra known as a [[Clifford algebra]].  Inner products with different properties can be used to construct different Clifford algebras.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=glOqQgAACAAJ&amp;dq=inauthor:%22J.+M.+McCarthy%22&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=_QoMToDvMcfd0QGFh-mvDg&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=book-thumbnail&amp;resnum=3&amp;ved=0CDsQ6wEwAg J.

==Geometric algebra==
{{See also|Blade (geometry)}}

Multivectors play a central role in the mathematical formulation of physics known as geometric algebra.  The term ''geometric algebra'' was used by E. Artin for matrix methods in projective geometry.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/dp/B009Z61B58/ref=rdr_ext_tmb  E. Artin, ''Geometric algebra, Interscience Publ., 1957]&lt;/ref&gt; It was D. Hestenes who used ''[[geometric algebra]]'' to describe the application of Clifford algebras to classical mechanics,&lt;ref&gt;D. Hestenes, New Foundations for Classical Mechanics, Kluwer Academic Publishers, 1986.&lt;/ref&gt;  This formulation was expanded to ''geometric calculus'' by D. Hestenes and G. Sobczyk,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Clifford-Algebra-Geometric-Calculus-Mathematics/dp/9027725616/ref=sr_1_10?s=books&amp;ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1396272483&amp;sr=1-10&amp;keywords=geometric+algebra D. Hestenes and G. Sobczyk, Clifford Algebra to Geometric Calculus: A Unified Language for Mathematics and Physics, Springer Verlag, 1987]&lt;/ref&gt; who provided new terminology for a variety of features in this application of Clifford algebra to physics. C. Doran and A. Lasenby show that Hestene's geometric algebra provides a convenient formulation for modern physics.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.amazon.com/Geometric-Algebra-Physicists-Chris-Doran/dp/0521715954/ref=pd_bxgy_b_img_z C.

In [[geometric algebra]], a multivector is defined to be the sum of different-grade [[blade (geometry)|''k''-blades]], such as the summation of a [[scalar (mathematics)|scalar]], a [[Vector (geometric)|vector]], and a ''2''-vector.&lt;ref name= Rodrigues&gt;{{cite book |title=Invariants for pattern recognition and classification |author=Marcos A.

&lt;/ref&gt; A sum of only ''k''-grade components is called a ''k''-vector,&lt;ref name=Sommer&gt;{{cite book |title=Computer algebra and geometric algebra with applications |editor1=Hongbo Li |editor2=Peter J.

&lt;/ref&gt; or a ''homogeneous'' multivector.&lt;ref name=Sanfeliu&gt;{{cite book |title=Progress in pattern recognition, image analysis and applications |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gsnXS1xdeekC&amp;pg=PA25 |page=25 |editor1=Alberto Sanfeliu |editor2=José Francisco Martínez Trinidad |editor3=Jesús Ariel Carrasco Ochoa |author=Eduardo Bayro-Corrochano |chapter = Clifford geometric algebra: A promising framework for computer vision, robotics and learning |isbn=3-540-23527-2 |publisher=Springer |year=2004}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

The highest grade element in a space is called a ''[[pseudoscalar]]''.

If a given element is homogeneous of a grade ''k'', then it is a ''k''-vector, but not necessarily a ''k''-blade.  Such an element is a ''k''-blade when it can be expressed as the wedge product of ''k'' vectors.  A geometric algebra generated by a 4-dimensional Euclidean vector space illustrates the point with an example: The sum of any two blades with one taken from the XY-plane and the other taken from the ZW-plane will form a 2-vector that is not a 2-blade.  In a geometric algebra generated by a Euclidean vector space of dimension 2 or 3, all sums of 2-blades may be written as a single 2-blade.

* 0-vectors are scalars;
* 1-vectors are vectors;
* 2-vectors are [[bivector]]s;
* (''n'' − 1)-vectors are [[pseudovector]]s;
* ''n''-vectors are [[pseudoscalar]]s.

In the presence of a [[volume form]] (such as given an [[inner product]] and an orientation), pseudovectors and pseudoscalars can be identified with vectors and scalars, which is routine in [[vector calculus]], but without a volume form this cannot be done without a choice.

In the [[algebra of physical space]] (the geometric algebra of Euclidean 3-space, used as a model of (3+1)-spacetime), a sum of a scalar and a vector is called a [[paravector]], and represents a point in spacetime (the vector the space, the scalar the time).

===Bivectors===
{{main|Bivector}}

A '''bivector''' is therefore an element of the [[antisymmetric tensor|antisymmetric]] [[tensor product]] of a [[tangent space]] with itself.

In [[geometric algebra]], also, a '''bivector''' is a grade 2 element (a 2-vector) resulting from the [[wedge product]] of two vectors, and so it is geometrically an ''oriented area'', in the same way a ''vector'' is an oriented line segment. If '''a''' and '''b''' are two vectors, the bivector {{nowrap|'''a''' ∧ '''b'''}} has

* a [[norm (mathematics)|norm]] which is its area, given by
*:&lt;math&gt;\left\| \mathbf a \wedge \mathbf b \right\| = \left\| \mathbf{a} \right\| \, \left\| \mathbf{b} \right\| \, \sin(\phi_{a,b})&lt;/math&gt;
* a direction: the plane where that area lies on, i.e., the plane determined by '''a''' and '''b''', as long as they are linearly independent;
* an orientation (out of two), determined by the order in which the originating vectors are multiplied. 
Bivectors are connected to [[pseudovector]]s, and are used to represent rotations in geometric algebra.

As bivectors are elements of a vector space Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' (where ''V'' is a finite-dimensional vector space with {{nowrap|1=dim ''V'' = ''n''}}), it makes sense to define an [[inner product]] on this vector space as follows. First, write any element {{nowrap|''F'' ∈ Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''V''}} in terms of a basis {{nowrap|1=('''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''i''&lt;/sub&gt; ∧ '''e'''&lt;sub&gt;''j''&lt;/sub&gt;)&lt;sub&gt;1 ≤ ''i'' &lt; ''j'' ≤ ''n''&lt;/sub&gt; of Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''V''}} as

: &lt;math&gt;F = F^{ab} \mathbf{e}_a \wedge \mathbf{e}_b \quad (1 \le a &lt; b  \le n) ,&lt;/math&gt;

where the [[Einstein summation convention]] is being used.

Now define a map {{nowrap|G : Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' × Λ&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt;''V'' → '''R'''}} by insisting that

: &lt;math&gt;G(F, H) := G_{abcd}F^{ab}H^{cd} ,&lt;/math&gt;

where &lt;math&gt;G_{abcd}&lt;/math&gt; are a set of numbers.

==Applications==
Bivectors play many important roles in physics, for example, in the [[classification of electromagnetic fields]].

The '''''nomenklatura''''' ({{lang-rus|номенклату́ра|p=nəmʲɪnklɐˈturə}}; {{lang-la|nomenclatura}}) were a category of people within the [[Soviet Union]] and other [[Eastern Bloc]] countries who held various key administrative positions in the [[bureaucracy]], running all spheres of those countries' activity: government, industry, agriculture, education, etc., whose positions were granted only with approval by the [[communist party]] of each country or region.

Virtually all members of the nomenklatura were members of the Communist Party.&lt;ref name="Dogan"&gt;{{cite book|title=Elites, crises, and the origins of regimes|year=1998|publisher=[[Rowman &amp; Littlefield]]|isbn=0-8476-9023-7|pages=128|author1=Dogan, Mattéi   |author2=Higley, John |lastauthoramp=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; Critics of [[Joseph Stalin|Stalin]], such as [[Milovan Djilas|Milovan Đilas]], critically defined them as a "[[new class]]".&lt;ref name="Wasserstein"&gt;{{cite book|last=Wasserstein|first=Bernard|title=Barbarism and civilization: a history of Europe in our time|year=2007|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|isbn=0-19-873074-8|pages=509}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Leon Trotsky|Trotsky]] used the term ''caste'' rather than ''class'', because he saw the Soviet Union as a [[degenerated workers' state]], not a new class society. Later developments of Trotsky's theories, such as [[Tony Cliff]]'s theory of [[state capitalism]], did refer to the nomenklatura as a new ''class''. [[Richard Pipes]], an anti-communist writer, claimed that this system mainly reflected a continuation of the old [[Tsarist regime]], as many former Tsarist officials or "[[careerist]]s" joined the Bolshevik government during and after the [[Russian Civil War]].&lt;ref&gt;Pipes, Russia Under the Bolshevik Regime, p.444&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''nomenklatura'' forming a ''de facto'' [[elite]] of public powers in the previous Eastern Bloc, may be compared to the western ''[[The Establishment|establishment]]''&lt;ref&gt;Alan Barcan, ''Sociological theory and educational reality'' (1993) p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; holding or controlling both private and public powers (e.g., media, finance, trade, industry, state and institutions).&lt;ref&gt;See also [[Norbert Elias]], ''The Established and the Outsiders. A Sociological Enquiry into Community Problems''&lt;/ref&gt;

==Etymology==
The [[Russian language|Russian]] term is derived from the [[Latin]] ''[[Nomenclature|nomenclatura]]'', meaning a list of names.

The term was popularized in the West by the [[Soviet dissident]] [[Michael Voslenski]], who in 1970 wrote a book titled ''Nomenklatura: The Soviet Ruling Class'' ({{lang-ru|Номенклатура. Господствующий класс Сове́тского Сою́за}}).

==Description==
The nomenklatura referred to the Communist Party's [[governance]] to make appointments to key positions throughout the governmental system, as well as throughout the party's own hierarchy. Specifically, the nomenklatura consisted of two separate lists: one was for key positions, appointments to which were made by authorities within the party; the other was for persons who were potential candidates for appointment to those positions. The [[Politburo]], as part of its nomenklatura authority, maintained a list of ministerial and ambassadorial positions that it had the power to fill, as well as a separate list of potential candidates to occupy those positions.

Coextensive with the nomenklatura were patron-client relations. Officials who had the authority to appoint individuals to certain positions cultivated loyalties among those whom they appointed. The patron (the official making the appointment) promoted the interests of clients in return for their support. Powerful patrons, such as the members of the Politburo, had many clients. Moreover, an official could be both a client (in relation to a higher-level patron) and a patron (to other, lower-level officials).

Because a client was beholden to his patron for his position, the client was eager to please his patron by carrying out his policies. The Soviet power structure essentially consisted (according to its critics) of groups of [[vassals]] (clients) who had an overlord (the patron). The higher the patron, the more clients the patron had. Patrons protected their clients and tried to promote their careers. In return for the patron's efforts to promote their careers, the clients remained loyal to their patron. Thus, by promoting his clients' careers, the patron could advance his own power.

===Party's appointment authority===
The nomenklatura system arose early in Soviet history. [[Vladimir Lenin]] wrote that appointments were to take the following criteria into account: reliability, political attitude, qualifications, and administrative ability. [[Joseph Stalin]], who was the first general secretary of the party, also was known as "Comrade File Cabinet" (Tovarishch Kartotekov) for his assiduous attention to the details of the party's appointments. Seeking to make appointments in a more systematic fashion, Stalin built the party's patronage system and used it to distribute his clients throughout the party bureaucracy.

Under Stalin's direction in 1922, the party created departments of the Central Committee and other organs at lower levels that were responsible for the registration and appointment of party officials. Known as [[uchraspred]], these organs supervised appointments to important party posts. According to American sovietologist Seweryn Bialer, after [[Leonid Brezhnev]]'s accession to power in October 1964, the party considerably expanded its appointment authority. However, in the late 1980s some official statements indicated that the party intended to reduce its appointment authority, particularly in the area of economic management, in line with [[Mikhail Gorbachev]]'s reform efforts.

At the all-union level, the Party Building and Cadre Work Department supervised party nomenklatura appointments. This department maintained records on party members throughout the country, made appointments to positions on the all-union level, and approved nomenklatura appointments on the lower levels of the hierarchy. The head of this department sometimes was a member of the Secretariat and was often a protégé of the general secretary.

Every party committee and party organizational department, from the all-union level in Moscow to the district and city levels, prepared two lists according to their needs. The basic (osnovnoi) list detailed positions in the political, administrative, economic, military, cultural, and educational bureaucracies that the committee and its department had responsibility for filling. The registered (uchetnyi) list enumerated the persons suitable for these positions.

===Patron–client relations===
An official in the party or government bureaucracy could not advance in the nomenklatura without the assistance of a patron. In return for this assistance in promoting his career, the client carried out the policies of the patron. [[Clientelism|Patron–client relation]]s thus help to explain the ability of party leaders to generate widespread support for their policies. The presence of patron–client relations between party officials and officials in other bureaucracies also helped to account for the large-scale control the party exercised over the Soviet society. All of the 2 million members of the nomenklatura system understood that they held their positions only as a result of a favor bestowed on them by a superior official in the party and that they could easily be replaced if they manifested disloyalty to their patron. Self-interest dictated that members of the nomenklatura submit to the control of their patrons in the party.

Clients sometimes could attempt to supplant their patron. For example, [[Nikita Khrushchev]], one of [[Lazar M. Kaganovich]]'s former protégés, helped to oust the latter in 1957. Seven years later, [[Leonid Brezhnev]], a client of Khrushchev, helped to remove his boss from power. The power of the general secretary was consolidated to the extent that he placed his clients in positions of power and influence. The ideal for the general secretary, writes Soviet émigré observer [[Michael Voslensky]], "is to be overlord of vassals selected by oneself."

Several factors explain the entrenchment of patron–client relations. Firstly, in a centralized government system, promotion in the bureaucratic-political hierarchy was the only path to power. Secondly, the most important criterion for promotion in this hierarchy was approval from one's supervisors, who evaluated their subordinates on the basis of political criteria and their ability to contribute to the fulfillment of the economic plan. Thirdly, political rivalries were present at all levels of the party and state bureaucracies but were especially prevalent at the top. Power and influence decided the outcomes of these struggles, and the number and positions of one's clients were critical components of that power and influence. Fourthly, because fulfillment of the economic plan was decisive, systemic pressures led officials to conspire together and use their ties to achieve that goal.

The faction led by Brezhnev provides a good case study of patron–client relations in the Soviet system. Many members of the Brezhnev faction came from [[Dnipropetrovsk]], where Brezhnev had served as first secretary of the provincial party organization. [[Andrei Kirilenko (politician)|Andrei P. Kirilenko]], a [[Politburo]] member and [[Central Committee]] secretary under Brezhnev, was first secretary of the regional committee of Dnipropetrovsk. [[Volodymyr Shcherbytsky]], named as first secretary of the [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] apparatus under Brezhnev, succeeded Kirilenko in that position. [[Nikolai Alexandrovich Tikhonov]], appointed by Brezhnev as first deputy chairman of the Soviet Union's [[Council of Ministers of the USSR|Council of Ministers]], graduated from the [[Dnipropetrovsk Metallurgical Institute]], and presided over the economic council of Dnipropetrovsk Oblast. Finally, [[Nikolai Shchelokov]], [[minister of internal affairs]] under Brezhnev, was a former chairman of the Dnipropetrovsk soviet.

Patron–client relations had implications for policy making in the party and government bureaucracies. Promotion of trusted subordinates into influential positions facilitated policy formation and policy execution. A network of clients helped to ensure that a patron's policies could be carried out. In addition, patrons relied on their clients to provide an accurate flow of information on events throughout the country. This information assisted policymakers in ensuring that their programs were being implemented.

==''The New Class''==
[[Milovan Đilas]], a critic of Stalin, wrote of the nomenklatura as the "[[new class]]" in his book ''[[The New Class: An Analysis of the Communist System]]'', and he claimed that it was seen by ordinary citizens as a bureaucratic elite that enjoyed special privileges and had supplanted the earlier wealthy capitalist élites.

==Criticism==
Some Marxists, such as [[Ernest Mandel]], have criticised Đilas and the theory of [[state capitalism]]: &lt;blockquote&gt;The hypothesis that the Soviet bureaucracy is a new ruling class does not correspond to a serious analysis of the real development and the real contradictions of Soviet society and economy in the last fifty years. Such a hypothesis must imply, from the point of view of [[historical materialism]], that a new exploitative [[mode of production]] has emerged in that country. If this were so, we would be confronted, for the first time in history, with a "ruling class" whose general behavior and private interests (which of course dictate that behavior) run counter to the needs and inner logic of the existing socio-economic system. Indeed, one of the main characteristics of the [[Soviet economy]] is the impossibility of reconciling the needs of planning, of optimizing economic growth (not from an "absolute" point of view, but from within the logic of the system itself) with the material self-interest of the bureaucracy.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.ernestmandel.org/en/works/txt/1979/soviet_bureaucracy.htm&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The People's Uprising rally or '''Himpunan Kebangkitan Rakyat''' ([[Malay language|Malay]]) was a rally that was held in [[Kuala Lumpur]], [[Malaysia]] on 12 January 2013.  The rally was held by various Malaysian opposition friendly non-governmental organisations and opposition parties in opposition to many of the government policies and decisions that have been claimed by left wing supporters to be unfair and affecting the Malaysian populace.  The main venue which the organisers have chosen for the rally is [[Stadium Merdeka]]. The event was also known as the '''KL 112 rally''', where the numbers indicate the date of the event.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2013/1/14/nation/12571834&amp;sec=nation|title=Kudos to cops and KL112 rally|date=14 January 2013|work=The Star (Malaysia)|accessdate=14 January 2013|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130116061009/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2013%2F1%2F14%2Fnation%2F12571834&amp;sec=nation|archivedate=16 January 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/218831|title=The winners and losers in KL112 - Malaysiakini|date=13 January 2013|work=[[Malaysiakini]]|accessdate=14 January 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Background ==
According to social activist and icon Hishamuddin Rais, the grievances against the government are many and varied&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Malaysia |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/litee/malaysia/article/january-rally-to-go-on-even-without-permit-says-activist |title=January rally to go on even without permit, says activist |publisher=The Malaysian Insider |date= |accessdate=17 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130216214724/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/litee/malaysia/article/january-rally-to-go-on-even-without-permit-says-activist |archivedate=16 February 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following lists of grouses:
* The scrapping of the rare-earth refinery run by [[Lynas]] in [[Kuantan]], [[Pahang]].
* To fight against cheating in the general elections by the Malaysian government.
* The fair distribution of oil-royalty payments by the Malaysian government to oil producing states.
* Free education for all Malaysians.

The election watchdog group [[Bersih]] which organised a number of rallies calling for electoral reform in Malaysia namely the rallies in the Bersih rallies in [[Bersih 2.0 rally|2011]] and [[Bersih 3.0 rally|2012]] has revealed that it is not amongst the organisers of the latest rally but has said that many of members will be attending the rally on their own capacity.

The opposition coalition [[Pakatan Rakyat]] has made a 10-point declaration:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=To |first=Queville |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2013/01/12/pakatan-makes-10-point-demand/ |title=Pakatan makes 10-point demand |publisher=Free Malaysia Today |date=12 January 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.thesundaily.my/news/587074 ]{{dead link|date=January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;
* Free and fair elections
* Saving Felda
* Restoring the rights of Sabah and Sarawak
* Increasing the oil royalty to petroleum producing states to 20%
* Safeguarding the future of the civil servants
* A clean and healthy environment
* Strengthening the national language and mother tongues
* Freeing of all political detainees
* Preserving the Malaysia's national heritage
* Better living standards for women

== Lead up to the rally ==

=== Government and police measures ===
The police have advised the organisers of the rally to hold the rally in [[National Stadium, Bukit Jalil|Bukit Jalil stadium]] instead of having it in Stadium Merdeka.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/218623 |title=Malaysiakini |publisher=Malaysiakini |date=10 January 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In anticipation of the protests the government began the closure of Dataran Merdeka to prevent protesters from gathering at that location.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=To |first=Queville |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2013/01/11/dataran-closed-ahead-of-rally/ |title=Dataran closed ahead of rally, no FRU deployment |publisher=Free Malaysia Today |date=11 January 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government has also warned against civil servants from attending the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author=Malaysia |url=http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/civil-servants-advised-against-joining-the-rally-tomorrow/ |title=Civil servants advised against joining the rally tomorrow |publisher=The Malaysian Insider |date= |accessdate=17 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141023061410/http://www.themalaysianinsider.com/malaysia/article/civil-servants-advised-against-joining-the-rally-tomorrow/ |archivedate=23 October 2014 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Various public universities in Malaysia echoed the government's warning telling students and teachers not to attend the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/218670 |title=Malaysiakini |publisher=Malaysiakini |date=11 January 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/218699 |title=Malaysiakini |publisher=Malaysiakini |date=11 January 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The government-controlled mainstream media gave scant coverage on the rally.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/218681 |title=Malaysiakini |publisher=Malaysiakini |date=11 January 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Protests ==
There were fears by a Malaysian NGO Solidariti Anak Muda Malaysia (SAMM) that there would be some provocations by the police during the demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=To |first=Queville |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2013/01/12/fear-of-agent-provocateurs/ |title=Fear of agent provocateurs |publisher=Free Malaysia Today |date=12 January 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the rally ended, the [[PDRM]] or the Malaysian Royal Police was praised as they shown tremendous amount of patience and restraint.

[[File:Protesters PUR.jpg|thumb|Participants taking a rest.]]

According to different estimates there were about 100,000 to 150,000 people who attended the rally, which was quite peaceful compared the previous rallies.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=To |first=Queville |url=http://www.freemalaysiatoday.com/category/nation/2013/01/12/trouble-free-rally-kicks-off/ |title=100,000 rally ends peacefully |publisher=Free Malaysia Today |date=12 January 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/218826 |title=Malaysiakini |publisher=Malaysiakini |date=13 January 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysia-chronicle.com/index.php?option=com_k2&amp;view=item&amp;id=46455:politweet-says-150k-at-rally-but-assumes-stadium-can-only-house-30k-doesnt-include-all-meeting-points&amp;Itemid=2 |title=Politweet says 150k at rally but assumes Stadium only houses 30k, meeting pts not included |publisher=Malaysia-chronicle.com |date= |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many of the rally goers gathered at various points of the city before making their way to Stadium Merdeka where the rally organisers conducted a number of speeches in support of their ideals.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.malaysiakini.com/news/218741 |title=Malaysiakini |publisher=Malaysiakini |date=12 January 2013 |accessdate=17 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2013/1/13/nation/12570245&amp;sec=nation |title=Police successfully deploy new management method to maintain order during rally - Nation &amp;#124; The Star Online |publisher=Thestar.com.my |date= |accessdate=17 January 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130115170959/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2013%2F1%2F13%2Fnation%2F12570245&amp;sec=nation |archivedate=15 January 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

They also provide an appropriate algebraic framework for many [[knot invariants]] (in particular the [[Jones polynomial]]), and have been used in describing the properties of [[Khovanov homology]] with respect to [[tangle (mathematics)|tangle]] composition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.math.toronto.edu/~drorbn/papers/Cobordism/ |title=Dror Bar-Natan: Publications: Cobordisms |doi=10.2140/gt.2005.9.1443 |website=Math.toronto.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://front.math.ucdavis.edu/math.GT/0410495 |title=Front: [math/0410495&amp;#93; Khovanov's homology for tangles and cobordisms |doi=10.2140/gt.2005.9.1443 |website=Front.math.ucdavis.edu |date= |accessdate=2016-11-20}}&lt;/ref&gt; Any subfactor planar algebra provides a family of unitary representations of [[Thompson groups]].

===Planar tangle===

A (shaded) '''planar tangle''' is the data of  finitely many ''input'' disks, one ''output'' disk, non-intersecting strings giving an even number, say &lt;math&gt;2n &lt;/math&gt;, intervals per disk and one &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt;-marked  interval per disk. 
 
[[image:Tangle.png|200px]]

Here, the mark is shown as a &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt;-shape. On each input disk it is placed between two adjacent outgoing strings, and on the output disk it is placed between two adjacent incoming strings. A planar tangle is defined up to [[Homotopy#Isotopy|isotopy]].

===Composition===

To ''compose'' two planar tangles, put the output disk of one into an input of the other, having as many intervals, same shading of marked intervals and such that the &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt;-marked intervals coincide. Finally we remove the coinciding circles. Note that two planar tangles can have zero, one or several possible compositions.

[[image:Composition.png|550px]]

===Planar operad===
The '''planar operad''' is the set of all the planar tangles (up to isomorphism) with such compositions.

===Planar algebra===

A '''planar algebra''' is a ''representation'' of the planar operad; more precisely, it is a family of vector spaces &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{P}_{n,\pm})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt;, called &lt;math&gt;n&lt;/math&gt;-box spaces, on which ''acts'' the planar operad, i.e. for any tangle &lt;math&gt;T&lt;/math&gt; (with one output disk and &lt;math&gt;r&lt;/math&gt; input disks with &lt;math&gt;2n_0&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;2n_1, \dots, 2n_r&lt;/math&gt; intervals respectively) there is a multilinear map
: &lt;math&gt;Z_T : \mathcal{P}_{n_1,\epsilon_1} \otimes \cdots \otimes  \mathcal{P}_{n_r,\epsilon_r} \to \mathcal{P}_{n_0,\epsilon_0}&lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt;\epsilon_i \in \{+,-\}&lt;/math&gt; according to the shading of the &lt;math&gt; \star&lt;/math&gt;-marked intervals, and these maps (also called partition functions) respect the composition of tangle in such a way that all the diagrams as below commute.

[[image:PlanarDiagram.png|550px]]

==Examples==

===Planar tangles===

The family of vector spaces  &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{T}_{n,\pm})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; generated by the planar tangles having  &lt;math&gt;2n &lt;/math&gt; intervals on their ''output'' disk and a white (or black)  &lt;math&gt;\star &lt;/math&gt;-marked interval, admits a planar algebra structure.

===Temperley–Lieb-Jones===

The Temperley-Lieb-Jones planar algebra &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{TLJ}(\delta)&lt;/math&gt; is generated by the planar tangles without input disk; its &lt;math&gt;3&lt;/math&gt;-box space &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{TLJ}_{3,+}(\delta)&lt;/math&gt; is generated by

[[image:TLJ3.png|500px]]

Moreover, a closed string is replaced by a multiplication by &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt;.

[[image:DeltaMultiplication.png|500px]]

Note that the dimension of &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{TLJ}_{n,\pm}(\delta) &lt;/math&gt; is the [[Catalan number]]  &lt;math&gt; \frac{1}{n+1}\binom{2n}{n} &lt;/math&gt;.
This planar algebra encodes the notion of [[Temperley–Lieb algebra]].

===Hopf algebra===

A semisimple and cosemisimple [[Hopf algebra]] over an algebraically closed field is encoded in a planar algebra defined by generators and relations.

}}
&lt;/ref&gt;

==Subfactor planar algebra==

===Definition===

A '''subfactor planar algebra''' is a planar &lt;math&gt;\star&lt;/math&gt;-algebra &lt;math&gt;(\mathcal{P}_{n,\pm})_{n \in \mathbb{N}}&lt;/math&gt; which is: 
: (1) Finite-dimensional: &lt;math&gt; \dim (\mathcal{P}_{n,\pm}) &lt; \infty &lt;/math&gt;
: (2) Evaluable:  &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P}_{0,\pm} = \mathbb{C}&lt;/math&gt;
: (3) Spherical: &lt;math&gt;tr:=tr_r = tr_l &lt;/math&gt;
: (4) Positive:  &lt;math&gt; \langle a \vert b \rangle = tr(b^{\star}a)&lt;/math&gt; defines an inner product.

Note that by (2) and (3), any closed string (shaded or not) counts for the same constant &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt;.

The tangle action deals with the adjoint by:  
: &lt;math&gt; Z_T(a_1 \otimes a_2 \otimes \cdots \otimes a_r)^{\star} = Z_{T^{\star}}(a_1^{\star} \otimes a_2^{\star} \otimes \cdots \otimes a_r^{\star}) &lt;/math&gt;

with &lt;math&gt; T^{\star}&lt;/math&gt; the mirror image of &lt;math&gt; T &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; a_i^{\star} &lt;/math&gt; the adjoint of  &lt;math&gt; a_i &lt;/math&gt; in &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P}_{n_i,\epsilon_i} &lt;/math&gt;.

===Examples and results===

''No-ghost theorem'': The planar algebra &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{TLJ}(\delta) &lt;/math&gt; has no ghost (i.e. element &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; \langle a \vert a \rangle &lt; 0 &lt;/math&gt;) if and only if 
: &lt;math&gt; \delta \in \{ 2\cos(\pi/n) | n=3,4,5,... \} \cup [2, +\infty] &lt;/math&gt;  
For &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; as above, and after a quotient by the null ideal &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt; (generated by elements &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; \langle a \vert a \rangle = 0 &lt;/math&gt;), we get a subfactor planar algebra. Any subfactor planar algebra with constant &lt;math&gt; \delta &lt;/math&gt; admits &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{TLJ}(\delta)/\mathcal{I} &lt;/math&gt; as planar subalgebra.

A planar algebra &lt;math&gt; (\mathcal{P}_{n,\pm})&lt;/math&gt; is a subfactor planar algebra if and only if it is the [[Subfactor#Standard invariant|standard invariant]] of an extremal [[subfactor]] &lt;math&gt; N \subseteq M &lt;/math&gt; of index &lt;math&gt; [M:N] = \delta^2 &lt;/math&gt;,  with &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P}_{n,+}= N' \cap M_{n-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P}_{n,-}= M' \cap M_{n} &lt;/math&gt;.&lt;ref&gt;

A finite depth or irreducible [[subfactor]] is extremal (&lt;math&gt;tr_{N'} = tr_{M}&lt;/math&gt; on &lt;math&gt;N' \cap M&lt;/math&gt;).  
 
There is a subfactor planar algebra encoding any finite group (and any finite dimensional [[Hopf algebra|Hopf &lt;math&gt;{\rm C}^{\star}&lt;/math&gt;-algebra]], called Kac algebra), defined by generators and relations.

A Bisch-Jones planar algebra  &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{BJ}(\delta_1, \delta_2) &lt;/math&gt;, initially called Fuss-Catalan, can be defined as for &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{TLJ}(\delta) &lt;/math&gt; but by allowing two colors of string with their own constant &lt;math&gt; \delta_1 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \delta_2 &lt;/math&gt;. For &lt;math&gt; \delta_i &lt;/math&gt; as above, and after the null quotient, it is a planar subalgebra of any subfactor planar algebra with an intermediate such that &lt;math&gt; [K:N] = \delta_1^2 &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; [M:K] = \delta_2^2 &lt;/math&gt;.

A finite depth hyperfinite subfactor is amenable. 

About the non-amenable case: there are unclassifiably many irreducible hyperfinite subfactors of index 6 that all have the same standard invariant.

===Fourier transform and biprojections===
Let &lt;math&gt;N \subset M &lt;/math&gt; be a finite index subfactor, and &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; the corresponding subfactor planar algebra. Assume that &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{P}&lt;/math&gt; is irreducible (i.e. &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P}_{1,+} =  N' \cap M_1 = \mathbb{C}  &lt;/math&gt;). Let &lt;math&gt;N \subset K \subset M&lt;/math&gt; be an intermediate subfactor. Let the Jones projection &lt;math&gt; e^M_K: L^2(M) \to L^2(K)&lt;/math&gt;. Note that &lt;math&gt; e^M_K \in \mathcal{P}_{2,+}  &lt;/math&gt;. Let &lt;math&gt; id:=e^M_M &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; e_1:=e^M_N &lt;/math&gt;.
 
[[image:E1id.png|410px]]

Note that &lt;math&gt; tr(e_1) = \delta^{-2} = [M:N]^{-1}&lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;tr(id) = 1&lt;/math&gt;.

Let the bijective linear map &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F}: \mathcal{P}_{2,\pm} \to  \mathcal{P}_{2,\mp} &lt;/math&gt; be the '''Fourier transform''', also called &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;-click (of the outer star) or &lt;math&gt;90^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt; rotation; and let &lt;math&gt;a * b&lt;/math&gt; be the '''coproduct''' of &lt;math&gt; a &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt;b&lt;/math&gt;.

[[image:FourierCoproduct.png|450px]]

Note that the word ''coproduct'' is a diminutive of ''convolution product''. It is a binary operation.

The coproduct satisfies the equality  &lt;math&gt; a * b = \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{F}^{-1}(a) \mathcal{F}^{-1}(b)). &lt;/math&gt;

For any positive operators &lt;math&gt;a,b&lt;/math&gt;, the coproduct  &lt;math&gt;a*b&lt;/math&gt; is also positive; this can be seen diagrammatically:

Let &lt;math&gt;\overline{a} := \mathcal{F}(\mathcal{F}(a))&lt;/math&gt; be the '''contragredient''' &lt;math&gt;a&lt;/math&gt; (also called &lt;math&gt;180^{\circ}&lt;/math&gt; rotation).  The map &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}^{4}&lt;/math&gt; corresponds to four &lt;math&gt;1&lt;/math&gt;-clicks of the outer star, so it's the identity map, and then &lt;math&gt;\overline{\overline{a}} = a&lt;/math&gt;.

In the Kac algebra case, the contragredient is exactly the antipode,&lt;ref name="PAKac"/&gt; which, for a finite group, correspond to the inverse.

A '''biprojection''' is a projection &lt;math&gt; b \in \mathcal{P}_{2,+} \setminus \{ 0\} &lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{F}(b)&lt;/math&gt; a multiple of a projection. 
Note that &lt;math&gt; e_1=e^M_N &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; id=e^M_M &lt;/math&gt; are biprojections; this can be seen as follows:

[[image:F(e1).png|480px]]

A projection &lt;math&gt; b &lt;/math&gt;  is a biprojection iff it is the Jones projection &lt;math&gt; e^M_K&lt;/math&gt; of an intermediate subfactor &lt;math&gt; N \subset K \subset M &lt;/math&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; in the Kac algebra case, the biprojections are 1-1 with the left coideal subalgebras, which, for a finite group, correspond to the subgroups.

The [[uncertainty principle]] extends to any irreducible subfactor planar algebra &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P} &lt;/math&gt;:

Let &lt;math&gt;\mathcal{S}(x) = Tr(R(x))&lt;/math&gt; with &lt;math&gt; R(x) &lt;/math&gt; the range projection of &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; Tr &lt;/math&gt; the unnormalized trace (i.e. &lt;math&gt; Tr = \delta^n tr &lt;/math&gt; on  &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{P}_{n,\pm} &lt;/math&gt;).

&lt;/ref&gt; Let &lt;math&gt; x \in \mathcal{P}_{2,\pm} &lt;/math&gt;, nonzero. Then
: &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{S}(x) \mathcal{S}(\mathcal{F}(x)) \ge \delta^{2}  &lt;/math&gt;
Assuming &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; and &lt;math&gt; \mathcal{F}(x) &lt;/math&gt; positive, the equality holds if and only if &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is a biprojection. More generally, the equality holds if and only if &lt;math&gt; x &lt;/math&gt; is the ''bi-shift'' of a biprojection.

'''Relationship contingent self-esteem''' (RCSE) is a type of [[self-esteem]] that derives from the outcomes, process, and nature of one’s romantic relationship.&lt;ref name="KneeCanevello2008"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Knee|first1=C. Raymond|last2=Canevello|first2=Amy|last3=Bush|first3=Amber L.|last4=Cook|first4=Astrid|title=Relationship-contingent self-esteem and the ups and downs of romantic relationships.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=95|issue=3|year=2008|pages=608–627|issn=1939-1315|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.95.3.608|pmid=18729698}}&lt;/ref&gt; Like other types of contingent self-esteem, it is generally linked with lower levels of self-esteem and [[well-being]].&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crocker|first1=Jennifer|last2=Park|first2=Lora E.|title=The Costly Pursuit of Self-Esteem.|journal=Psychological Bulletin|volume=130|issue=3|year=2004|pages=392–414|issn=0033-2909|doi=10.1037/0033-2909.130.3.392|pmid=15122925}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It can be unhealthy for the relationship because it paves the way for excessive bias for negative interpretations of relationship events.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt; Past research has shown that relationship-contingent self-esteem is independent of feelings of commitment to one’s relationship, closeness to one’s partner, and satisfaction in the relationship.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt; Also, this research showed that it was linked to “obsessive immersion or preoccupation” with the romantic relationship.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt;

==Measurement==
Past research has measured RCSE with a psychological scale consisting of 11 items. The scale contains two related sub-scales: the general Contingent Self-Esteem Scale and the Contingencies of Self-Worth Scale.  The internal consistency of the scale is high, as is the two-week test-retest reliability.&lt;ref name="KneeCanevello2008" /&gt;

==Psychological properties==

===Attachment style===
Like other types of contingent self-esteem, RCSE is generally linked with lower levels of self-esteem and well-being.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt;  It is also associated with excessive reassurance seeking behavior, preoccupied [[attachment style]], and insecure attachment style.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt;  Ironically, these styles of attachment do not allow the person to attain the relationship security that they seek.  For example, displaying excessive reassurance seeking behavior from one’s partner can be a source of discord and strain on the relationship.  In addition, those with insecure attachment styles are less able to seek support and care giving in effective ways from their partners.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt;

===Rejection sensitivity===
Those who are high in RCSE are often high in [[Social rejection|rejection sensitivity]].&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt;  High rejection sensitivity is the tendency to anxiously expect rejection from one’s significant other.&lt;ref name="DowneyFreitas1998"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Downey|first1=Geraldine|last2=Freitas|first2=Antonio L.|last3=Michaelis|first3=Benjamin|last4=Khouri|first4=Hala|title=The self-fulfilling prophecy in close relationships: Rejection sensitivity and rejection by romantic partners.|journal=Journal of Personality and Social Psychology|volume=75|issue=2|year=1998|pages=545–560|issn=0022-3514|doi=10.1037/0022-3514.75.2.545}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Those who are high in rejection sensitivity act much more negatively in a discussion about relationship conflict with their significant others than do those who are low in rejection sensitivity.  In turn, this may cause the highly rejection sensitive individual’s partners to feel angrier after a discussion about conflict than do partners of individuals low in rejection sensitivity.

==How RCSE affects goals==

===Pursuing relationship success for self-esteem===
When self-esteem is contingent upon an external domain of life, in this case, the relationship, it will motivate a person to pursue short-term and long-term [[goal]]s that enhance and promote that domain (i.e. the relationship).&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt;  People with RCSE will want to prove that they are a success in their relationship because it will validate their sense of self.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt;

===Approval sex motives in women===
One example of the unhealthy nature of relationship-contingent self-esteem is the link between RCSE and greater approval sex motives.&lt;ref name="SanchezMoss-Racusin2010"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Sanchez|first1=Diana T.|last2=Moss-Racusin|first2=Corinne A.|last3=Phelan|first3=Julie E.|last4=Crocker|first4=Jennifer|title=Relationship Contingency and Sexual Motivation in Women: Implications for Sexual Satisfaction|journal=Archives of Sexual Behavior|volume=40|issue=1|year=2010|pages=99–110|issn=0004-0002|doi=10.1007/s10508-009-9593-4|pmid=20174863}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Sexual motivation]] may involve intimacy motives (i.e. the drive to create further intimacy or closeness) or approval sex motives (i.e. the drive to avoid disapproval from one’s partner about frequency or quality of sex).  Since theories about relationship contingent self-esteem posit that individuals who derive their self-esteem based on relationship outcomes may be more motivated than others to avoid negative outcomes and increase positive outcomes, it follows that these motives may apply in the sexual motivation arena.  A study by Sanchez and colleagues&lt;ref name="SanchezMoss-Racusin2010" /&gt; investigated the relationship between relationship contingent self-worth, approval sex motives, intimacy motives, sexual autonomy, and sexual satisfaction among women in committed relationships.

==Costs==

===To autonomy===
RCSE  may lead to low levels of [[autonomy]] by causing a person in a relationship to cater to the other person’s needs or the needs of the relationship at the expense of the needs of his or her [[self]].&lt;ref name="CrockerKnight2005" /&gt;  For example, if RCSE affects sexual motives by shifting the focus from achieving intimacy to garnering approval from one’s partner, this may lower sexual autonomy and satisfaction.&lt;ref name="SanchezMoss-Racusin2010" /&gt;

In general, when people are extremely motivated to protect or enhance self-esteem, they are more susceptible to [[Stress (psychological)|stress]] or [[anxiety]] because failure to do so results in a loss of self-esteem.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt;  Thus, for a person whose self-esteem is contingent upon relationship success, they will be motivated to maintain and enhance the relationship in order to protect their own self-esteem.  This may result in losing the sense of autonomy, or the sense that one is the originator of one’s own behavior and is doing things because one wants to rather than because one has to.  A person who views losing the relationship as a threat to oneself may act out of fear rather than [[Self-confidence|confidence]] and self-expression, thereby losing a sense of autonomy.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt;

===To relationship===
RCSE is thought{{who|date=April 2012}} to be unhealthy for the relationship because it paves the way for excessive bias for negative interpretations of relationship events.  A negative interpretive bias will in turn affect a person’s behavior toward his or her partner.  For example, since RCSE is often associated with having high levels of rejection sensitivity, the negative effects of rejection sensitivity will often damage the relationships of those with highly relationship contingent self-esteem.  A daily diary study of members of committed romantic couple’s thoughts and moods revealed that partners of highly rejection sensitive women showed notable upsurges in relationship dissatisfaction and thoughts of ending their relationships.  In addition, being a person who is high in rejection sensitivity in a relationship predicted breakup within a year.&lt;ref name="DowneyFreitas1998" /&gt;  When RCSE causes greater approval sex motives which in turn diminish a feeling of genuine sexual satisfaction, it may have negative consequences on the relationship by reducing sexual autonomy and satisfaction.  This has implications not just for the individual suffering from it directly but probably also for his or her partner, who is likely to sense his or her partner’s levels of sexual autonomy and satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;Dunn, K M; Croft, P R; Hackett, G I.  Satisfaction in the sex life of a general population sample. Journal of sex &amp; marital therapy, ISSN 0092-623X, 04/2000, Volume 26, Issue 2, pp. 141 – 151&lt;/ref&gt;
Having RCSE can make a person preoccupied with his or her own perceptions of the events in the relationship and perceptions of his or her partner’s behavior at the expense of considering the partner’s perceptions and experience.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt;  Excessive rumination and preoccupation with the state of the relationship because of a sense of pressure to keep up the relationship may eat up cognitive and emotional resources, which in turn may diminish the capacity empathize with the partner’s experience.  As a result, partners of individuals with RCSE may begin to distrust these individuals’ motivations and drives within the relationship.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt;

===To health===
Since having self-worth that is contingent upon the success of one’s relationship will motivate one to pursue success in order to preserve [[self-esteem]], some researchers believe that the [[anxiety]] and [[Stress (psychological)|stress]] associated with such pursuits will lead to long-term physical and mental health problems.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt;  Long term anxiety and stress can activate the pituitary-adrenal-cortical system, which can in turn lead to increases in cholesterol and triglycerides in the blood stream.  This in turn elevates the risk for heart disease.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt;  Another pathway to physical health problems is through unhealthy attempts at coping.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt;  For example, college students whose appearance and image contribute to their level of self-esteem may engage in unhealthy behaviors such as binge drinking and excessive partying.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt;  In addition, past research has shown that people who are more concerned with how others evaluate and perceive them tend to diet excessively, smoke, undergo cosmetic surgery, and consume more alcohol.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt;  In the realm of mental health, self-esteem that is highly unstable can contribute to higher levels of depressive symptoms.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt;

==Alternatives==

===Non-contingent self-esteem===
The healthy alternative to RCSE is to develop non-contingent self-esteem.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt;  This approach would require those in relationships to abandon external outcomes as a source for their own self-worth.  By doing so, it would free up their energies to relate on a mindful level to their relationship partner.  By shifting one’s source of self-worth from approval from others to compassion towards others, for instance, minor setbacks in a relationship will not be so alarming because it will not threaten the sense of self.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt;

===Self-compassion vs. self-esteem===
Alternatively, one can nurture [[self-compassion]] instead of [[self-esteem]].  Self-compassion researcher Professor Kristin Neff describes self-compassion as a combination of nurturing self-kindness over self-judgment, a sense of humanity over isolation, and a state of [[mindfulness]] rather than over-identification.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Neff | first1 = K. D. | year = 2003b | title = Self-compassion: An alternative conceptualization of a healthy attitude toward oneself | url = | journal = Self and Identity | volume = 2 | issue = | pages = 85–102 | doi=10.1080/15298860309032}}&lt;/ref&gt; A person experiencing distress who exercises self-compassion would be gentle towards him or herself rather than be harsh and critical and would recognize that he or she is not alone- rather, all people suffer at some point or another. This approach, Professor Neff and colleagues have found, can be beneficial for romantic relationships.&lt;ref name="NeffBeretvas2012" /&gt; In their study, self-compassion, not self-esteem, was significantly linked with greater relationship satisfaction.  In addition, the presence of self-compassion predicted more positive relationship behaviors and less negative behaviors.&lt;ref name="NeffBeretvas2012"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Neff|first1=Kristin D.|last2=Beretvas|first2=S. Natasha|title=The Role of Self-compassion in Romantic Relationships|journal=Self and Identity|year=2012|pages=1–21|issn=1529-8868|doi=10.1080/15298868.2011.639548|volume=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==
Research on RCSE has only been conducted in American samples.  In collectivist cultures, life satisfaction is often a result of living in harmony with the community and within one’s relationships with others rather than the attainment of high self-esteem.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kwan | first1 = Virginia S. Y. | last2 = Bond | first2 = Michael Harris | last3 = Singelis | first3 = Theodore M. | year = 1997 | title = Pancultural explanations for life satisfaction: Adding relationship harmony to self-esteem | url = | journal = Journal of Personality and Social Psychology | volume = 73 | issue = 5| pages = 1038–1051 | doi = 10.1037/0022-3514.73.5.1038 }}&lt;/ref&gt;  Therefore, it is unclear whether there is a difference in prevalence of RCSE among different nations and cultures.  Some researchers believe that the pursuit of a self-esteem, which is a hallmark consequence of all types of contingent self-esteem, is a fundamentally American phenomenon.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt; The Protestant Ethic and ideas of [[Self-sufficiency|self-reliance]] and [[meritocracy]] may lead Americans to believe that self-worth must be earned by performance and attainment, and that some people are worthier than others.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt;

==Conceptual importance for psychology==
RCSE, while a construct still in its infancy in psychology research, is an important model for psychology because it challenges and expands upon existing notions of self-esteem.  First of all, RCSE distinguishes between levels of state self-esteem and [[Trait theory|trait]] self-esteem.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt;  Whereas trait self-esteem seems to be relatively stable over time,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last1 = Kernis | first1 = Michael H | year = 2003 | title = Toward a Conceptualization of Optimal Self-Esteem | url = | journal = Psychological Inquiry | volume = 14 | issue = 1| pages = 1–26| doi = 10.1207/S15327965PLI1401_01 }}&lt;/ref&gt; state self-esteem can fluctuate in relatively short periods of time depending on circumstances, successes, and failures.&lt;ref name="CrockerPark2004" /&gt;  RCSE affects the state levels of self-esteem by boosting self-esteem if the relationship is going well, but diminishing it when it is not.&lt;ref name="CrockerKnight2005"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Crocker|first1=Jennifer|last2=Knight|first2=Katherine M.|title=Contingencies of Self-Worth|journal=Current Directions in Psychological Science|volume=14|issue=4|year=2005|pages=200–203|issn=0963-7214|doi=10.1111/j.0963-7214.2005.00364.x}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, the construct of RCSE challenges existing theory by suggesting that self-esteem does not exist in a vacuum, but that it is contingent upon success in one or more domains.  Those domains may be internal or external.  RCSE is an example of an contingency on an external domain, namely that of romantic relationships.&lt;ref name="CrockerKnight2005" /&gt;

===Future research===
Future research can investigate whether RCSE differs among cultures and contexts and whether it has harmful consequences in all cultures.  In addition, more research can examine whether there are gender differences in relationship contingent self-esteem, and if so, what the nature of those differences are.  Research on RCSE’s developmental trajectory can illuminate the factors that contribute to shaping it.  Further research on negative implications of RCSE can inform interventions and therapies designed to steer people away from RCSE and towards more healthy alternatives, such as self-compassion or non-contingent self-esteem.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5651">'''Richard Benjamin Moore''' (9 August 1893 &amp;ndash; 1978) was a [[Barbados]]-born [[wikt:Afro-Caribbean|African-Caribbean]] [[civil rights]] activist and prominent [[Socialist]]. He was also one of the earlier advocates of the term [[African American]] as opposed to [[Negro]], or "black".&lt;ref&gt;Richard B. Moore, [https://books.google.com/books?id=3jPFh_vj3GAC&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false ''The Name "Negro": Its Origin and Evil Use''] (1960), Baltimore, MD: Black Classic Press, 1992.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Biography==
===Early years===

Richard Benjamin Moore was a Barbadian writer born on 9 August 1893 in [[Barbados]], [[West Indies]], to Richard Henry Moore and Josephine Thorne Moore. In Barbados, the Richard Henry and Josephine Moore family was considered middle-class in terms of socioeconomic status. Richard Henry Moore was the moneymaker of the family, working as a [[preacher]] and building contractor in Barbados. Unfortunately, tragedy struck when Richard B. Moore’s mother died when he was three years old. Moore’s father later remarried, to Elizabeth Mclean. Soon thereafter, Moore’s father died in 1902 when young Richard was aged nine. With both biological parents dead, Moore was raised by his stepmother Elizabeth Mclean.

Mclean wanted to carry out Richard senior’s wishes of giving young Richard the best education. It is for this reason that Mclean aided young Richard in traveling to the [[United States]]. In hopes of furthering his education, Moore migrated to The United States of America and arrived in [[New York City]] on 4 July 1909. However, Moore would not become a naturalised citizen until 11 September 1924. Although African Americans were free in the United States, they were far from being treated equal to [[European-Americans]] in America. Moore was immediately faced with [[ethnic discrimination]] when it came to employment and educational opportunities among other things. Although trained in Barbados to do clerical work, he was forced to turn to the more unfavourable jobs such as elevator operator and work in a silk manufacturing firm.

===Political activism===

Due to the struggles that Moore encountered and observed, he became a strong vocalist for the rights of African Americans. In 1919 he joined the [[African Blood Brotherhood]] (ABB), which was an organization formed to defend African Americans from [[race riots]] and [[lynching]]. Moore, along with other African-American advocates, joined the [[Socialist Party]] in the early 1920s. Moore joined the Socialist Party, in part, because at the time the Socialist party was transforming itself into a force to fight against segregation.

Moore was a frequent political candidate of the Socialist Party. In 1928 he ran for [[U.S. Congress]] in New York's 21st Congressional District.&lt;ref&gt;"Red Ticket Goes on Ballot in NY State", ''Daily Worker,'' vol. 5, no. 241 (11 October 1928), p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; In [[New York state election, 1934|1934]], Moore ran on the Socialist ticket for [[Chief Judge of the New York Court of Appeals]]. In 1935, he became the organiser for the [[International Labor Defense]] in the [[New England]] Territory. He used his position in this organisation to speak on behalf the [[Scottsboro Boys]], a case in which nine young African-American males were accused of raping two young European-American women. 

In 1942, Moore was expelled from the Socialist Party because he was accused of being an [[Black nationalism|African-American nationalist]]; keeping African-American issues on the front burner.

He continued his efforts for [[Civil rights|equal rights]] in America. He also played a leading role in [[Caribbean]] advocacy groups. Moore, like his friend [[Hubert Harrison]], was a bibliophile, collecting over 15,000 books and pamphlets on the African-American experiences worldwide. This collection of books is currently housed in a library that Moore developed in Barbados. Moore also ran the [[Frederick Douglass]] Book Center in Harlem. 

Moore wrote a few books himself, including ''The Name Negro, Its Origin and Evil Use'' (1960) and ''Caribs, Cannibals and Human Relations'' (1972). He also had essays and articles published in various magazines and journals including the ''Negro Champion'', ''Daily Worker'', and ''Freedomways''.

===Death and legacy===

Richard Benjamin Moore died in his homeland of Barbados in 1978 at the age of 85.

A sequence diagram shows object interactions arranged in time sequence. It depicts the objects and classes involved in the scenario and the sequence of messages exchanged between the objects needed to carry out the functionality of the scenario. Sequence diagrams are typically associated with use case realizations in the Logical View of the system under development. Sequence diagrams are sometimes called '''event diagrams''' or '''event scenarios'''.

A sequence diagram shows, as parallel vertical lines (''lifelines''), different processes or objects that live simultaneously, and, as horizontal arrows, the messages exchanged between them, in the order in which they occur. This allows the specification of simple runtime scenarios in a graphical manner.

== Diagram building blocks ==
If the lifeline is that of an object, it demonstrates a role. Leaving the instance name blank can represent anonymous and unnamed instances.

Messages, written with horizontal [[Arrow (symbol)|arrows]] with the message name written above them, display interaction. Solid arrow heads represent synchronous calls, [http://i.stack.imgur.com/PO1pz.png open arrow heads] represent [http://www.uml-diagrams.org/sequence-diagrams.html asynchronous messages], and dashed lines represent reply messages.&lt;ref&gt;OMG (2011). [http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.4.1/Superstructure/PDF/ OMG Unified Modeling Language (OMG UML), Superstructure, V2.4.1], p. 507.&lt;/ref&gt;
If a caller sends a synchronous message, it must wait until the message is done, such as invoking a subroutine. If a caller sends an asynchronous message, it can continue processing and doesn’t have to wait for a response. Asynchronous calls are present in multithreaded applications, event-driven applications and in [[message-oriented middleware]]. 
Activation boxes, or [[Method (computer science)|method]]-call boxes, are opaque rectangles drawn on top of lifelines to represent that processes are being performed in response to the message (ExecutionSpecifications in [[Unified Modeling Language|UML]]).

Objects calling methods on themselves use messages and add new activation boxes on top of any others to indicate a further level of [[Process (computing)|processing]]. If an object is [[Object lifetime|destroyed]] (removed from [[Computer storage|memory]]), an X is drawn on bottom of the lifeline, and the dashed line ceases to be drawn below it. It should be the result of a message, either from the object itself, or another.

A message sent from outside the diagram can be represented by a message originating from a filled-in circle (''found message'' in UML) or from a border of the sequence diagram (''gate'' in UML).

UML  has introduced significant improvements to the capabilities of sequence diagrams. Most of these improvements are based on the idea of ''interaction fragments''&lt;ref&gt;OMG (2008). [http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.1.2/Superstructure/PDF OMG Unified Modeling Language (OMG UML), Superstructure, V2.1.2], p. 485.&lt;/ref&gt; which represent smaller pieces of an enclosing interaction. Multiple interaction fragments are combined to create a variety of ''combined fragments'',&lt;ref&gt;OMG (2007). [http://www.omg.org/spec/UML/2.1.2/Superstructure/PDF OMG Unified Modeling Language (OMG UML), Superstructure, V2.1.2]. p. 467.&lt;/ref&gt; which are then used to model interactions that include parallelism, conditional branches, optional interactions.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1290">In [[computer science]], a '''sequential algorithm''' or '''serial algorithm''' is an [[algorithm]] that is executed sequentially – once through, from start to finish, without other processing executing – as opposed to [[concurrent computing|concurrently]] or in [[parallel computing|parallel]]. The term is primarily used to contrast with ''[[concurrent algorithm]]'' or ''[[parallel algorithm]];'' most standard computer algorithms are sequential algorithms, and not specifically identified as such, as sequentialness is a background assumption. Concurrency and parallelism are in general distinct concepts, but they often overlap – many [[distributed algorithm]]s are both concurrent and parallel – and thus "sequential" is used to contrast with both, without distinguishing which one. If these need to be distinguished, the opposing pairs sequential/concurrent and serial/parallel may be used.

"Sequential algorithm" may also refer specifically to an algorithm for decoding a [[convolutional code]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.encyclopedia.com/doc/1O11-sequentialalgorithm.html|title=A Dictionary of Computing at Encyclopedia.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3072">In algebra, a '''simplicial commutative ring''' is a commutative [[monoid]] in the category of [[simplicial abelian group]]s, or, equivalently, a [[simplicial object]] in the category of commutative rings. If ''A'' is a simplicial commutative ring, then it can be shown that &lt;math&gt;\pi_0 A&lt;/math&gt; is a commutative [[ring (mathematics)|ring]] and &lt;math&gt;\pi_i A&lt;/math&gt; are modules over that ring (in fact, &lt;math&gt;\pi_* A&lt;/math&gt; is a [[graded ring]] over &lt;math&gt;\pi_0 A&lt;/math&gt;.)

A topology-counterpart of this notion is a [[commutative ring spectrum]].

== Graded ring structure ==
Let ''A'' be a simplicial commutative ring. Then the ring structure of ''A'' gives &lt;math&gt;\pi_* A = \oplus_{i \ge 0} \pi_i A&lt;/math&gt; the structure of a graded-commutative graded ring as follows.

By the [[Dold–Kan correspondence]], &lt;math&gt;\pi_* A&lt;/math&gt; is the homology of the chain complex corresponding to ''A''; in particular, it is a graded abelian group. Next, to multiply two elements, writing &lt;math&gt;S^1&lt;/math&gt; for the [[simplicial circle]], let &lt;math&gt;x:(S^1)^{\wedge i} \to A, \, \, y:(S^1)^{\wedge j} \to A&lt;/math&gt; be two maps. Then the composition
:&lt;math&gt;(S^1)^{\wedge i} \times (S^1)^{\wedge j} \to A \times A \to A&lt;/math&gt;,
the second map the multiplication of ''A'', induces &lt;math&gt;(S^1)^{\wedge i} \wedge (S^1)^{\wedge j} \to A&lt;/math&gt;. This in turn gives an element in &lt;math&gt;\pi_{i + j} A&lt;/math&gt;. We have thus defined the graded multiplication &lt;math&gt;\pi_i A \times \pi_j A \to \pi_{i + j} A&lt;/math&gt;. It is associative since the smash product is. It is graded-commutative (i.e., &lt;math&gt;xy = (-1)^{|x||y|} yx&lt;/math&gt;) since the involution &lt;math&gt;S^1 \wedge S^1 \to S^1 \wedge S^1&lt;/math&gt; introduces minus sign.

If ''M'' is a simplicial module over ''A'' (that is, ''M'' is a [[simplicial abelian group]] with an action of ''A''), then the similar argument shows that &lt;math&gt;\pi_* M &lt;/math&gt; has the structure of a graded module over &lt;math&gt;\pi_* A&lt;/math&gt;. (cf. [[module spectrum]].)

== Spec ==
By definition, the category of affine [[derived scheme]]s is the opposite category of the category of simplicial commutative rings; an object corresponding to ''A'' will be denoted by &lt;math&gt;\operatorname{Spec} A&lt;/math&gt;.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="9338">The term '''singularity''' for an explanation of unstable systems was first, and in a most general meaning used in 1873 by [[James Clerk Maxwell]].  Maxwell does not differentiate between [[dynamical system]]s and [[social system]]s. Therefore, a singularity refers to a context in which a small change can cause a large effect. The existence of singularities is primarily an argument against [[determinism]] and absolute [[causality]] for Maxwell. Indeed, following the same initial conditions will always achieve the same results, but such a statement is of little value in a world in which the same initial conditions are never repeated.&lt;ref&gt;Maxwell, J.C.: “Does the Progress of Physical Science tend to give any Advantage to the Opinion of Necessity (or Determinism) over that of the Contingency of Events and the Freedom of the Will?” in: L. Champbell/ W. Garnett: “The Life of James Clerk Maxwell”. London 1882, S. 440ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Characteristics ==
In summary, singularities are determined by the following characteristics which can vary in strength:
# Instability: Singularities are related to effect in which small causes produce great effects.
# System relatedness: Singularities represent a peculiarity based on a system and affect its identity.
# Uniqueness: Singularities do not stand out from quantitative singularity, but rather by qualitative uniqueness.
# Irreversibility: The caused changes of systems are largely irreversible.
# Subjectivity: The awareness is dependent on the human perception and experience.
# Randomness: Singularities are often considered as random because generally either the causes or their effects are not well known.
# Complexity: Their occurrence is often connected to the complexity of the system and its environment.
# Interaction: Singularities often arise when unexpected interactions occur between two systems.&lt;ref&gt;Holzkämpfer, H.: Management von Singularitäten und Chaos, Wiesbaden 1996, S. 91&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singularities in dynamical systems ==
A further development of Maxwell's thoughts in relation to dynamic systems was carried out first by the French mathematician [[Henri Poincaré]]. Poincaré distinguished four different simple singularities (points singuliers) of differential equations. These are the node (les noeuds), the saddle (les cols), the focus (les foyers) and the center (les centers).&lt;ref&gt;Poincaré, H.: Mémoire sur les courbes définies par une équation différentielle, in: Journal de mathématiques, 1881. S. 375-422.&lt;/ref&gt;
In recent times, the [[chaos theory]] found special attention. However, deterministic chaos is just a special case of a singularity, in which a small cause produces a large observable effect due to a nonlinear dynamic behavior. In contrast the singularities raised by Maxwell, such as a loose rock at a singular point on a slope, show a linear dynamic behavior as it was demonstrated by Poincaré.
Singularities are the common staple of the chaos theory, [[catastrophe theory]] and [[bifurcation theory]].&lt;ref&gt;Tu, P.N.V.: Dynamical Systems: An Introduction with Applications in Economics and Biology, 2. überarb. und erw. Aufl., Berlin, Heidelberg u.a. 1994, S.195ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singularities in social systems ==
In social systems, a deterministic chaos is unlikely, because the elements of the system are some individuals that engage with awareness, will and foresight purposefully into the dynamic behavior of the system.&lt;ref&gt;Weizsäcker, C. C. von: Ordnung und Chaos in der Wirtschaft, in: W. Gerock/ H. Haken u.a. (Hrsg.): Ordnung und Chaos in der unbelebten und belebten Natur. Stuttgart 1989. S. 46.&lt;/ref&gt; However, this does not exclude that approaches deterministic chaos in social systems are available. Rather, there is also an increase in the social development of nonlinear dynamics and instabilities .&lt;ref&gt;Bühl, W.L.: Sozialer Wandel im Ungleichgewicht: Zyklen, Fluktuationen, Katastrophen, Stuttgart 1990, S. 207.&lt;/ref&gt;
Chaos in the colloquial sense of complete disorder or confusion, however, is to be found. It is often the basis for singularities, where cause-and-effect relationships are not clear. There are already numerous examples of singularities in social systems with Maxwell and Poincaré. Maxwell states that a word can start a war and all the great discoveries of man based on singular states. Poincaré gives the example of a roofer who drops a brick and randomly kills a passing man.

== Singularities in natural history ==
The development of systems provides the science currently so before that by a singular [[Big Bang]] uniformly dispersed plasma spread after the creation of the universe in space, which is cooled with increasing expansion, so that formed atoms and finally for very small (singular) fluctuations in the uniform density inhomogeneities created self-reinforcing. They subsequently led to the formation of galaxies, stars and other systems in the universe, from which humans emerged at the end. Even if the singularity of the Big Bang can be avoided in the mathematical models, singularities remain an essential element of history.
The evolutionary history shows that not only successful mutations can be perceived as positive singularities, but the humanization and the human becoming, the singular most important event in the evolution and represents a jump from the continuum of past evolutionary development of the planet Earth.&lt;ref&gt;Hagemann, R.: Mutationen als produktive Singularitäten, in: J.-H. Scharf (Hrsg.): Singularitäten, Nova Acta Leopoldina, Abhandlungen der Deutschen Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina, Vorträge anläßlich der Jahresversammlung vom 30. März bis 2. April 1985 zu Halle (Saale), Leipzig 1989, S. 155-169.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vogel, C.: Die Hominisation, ein singulärer Sprung aus dem Kontinuum der Evolution?, in: J.-H. Scharf (Hrsg.): Singularitäten, Nova Acta Leopoldina, Abhandlungen der Deutschen Akademie der Naturforscher Leopoldina, Vorträge anläßlich der Jahresversammlung vom 30. März bis 2. April 1985 zu Halle (Saale). Leipzig 1989, S. 141–154.&lt;/ref&gt;
Recently, Ward and Kirschvink show that the history of life has been more influenced by disasters than by continuous evolution.&lt;ref&gt;Ward, P., Kirschvink, J .: A New History of Life, Munich 2016, S.30.&lt;/ref&gt; Disasters are here first destructive singularities that create space for new developments in the sense of innovations as productive singularities.&lt;ref&gt;Holzkämpfer, H .: Management of Singularities and Chaos, Wiesbaden 1996, pp. 133ff and 139ff.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Singularities and complexity==
Closely related is the notion of singularity with the concept of [[complexity]]. J.C. Maxwell has already pointed out that a system has all the more singular points, the more complex it is. Complexity is also the basis of perceived chaos and singularities. 
Suppose a seemingly insignificant event that produces a great effect, even in a simple context, how difficult would it be to detect the reason in a complex situation with tremendously many elements and relationships.
Complexity that is kind of a breeding ground for singularities, shows the downfall of ancient cultures. Causes such as intruders, internal conflicts or natural disasters are not sufficient alone to justify the destruction of a culture. Rather requirement is an increasing complexity and associated declining marginal returns.&lt;ref&gt;Tainter, J.A.: The Collapse of Complex Societies, Cambridge, New York u.a. 1988, S. 42ff.&lt;/ref&gt;
The [[financial crisis of 2007-2008]] shows how difficult decisions are in a very complex environment. Thus, the complexity of financial systems and financial products is a major challenge of the financial markets and institutions to look at.&lt;ref&gt;Landau, J.-P.: Complexity and the financial crisis, Introductory remarks at the Conference on The Macroeconomy and Financial Systems in Normal Times and in Times of Stress, jointly organized by Banque de france and the Bundesbank, 8. June, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; One solution is to reduce complexity and increase the potential for adaptation and robustness. In a complex world with increasing singularities, it is therefore necessary to abandon optimization potential to gain adaptability to external shocks and disasters.&lt;ref&gt;Conrad, M.: Adaptability: The Significance of Variability from Molecule to Ecosystem, New York, London 1983.&lt;/ref&gt;

The proper strappado causes permanent visible damage.

==Variants==
{{ref improve section|date=October 2016}}
{{original research|section|date=October 2016}}
There are three variants of this torture. In the first, victims have their arms tied behind their backs; a large rope is then tied to the wrists and passed over a [[pulley]], [[Beam (structure)|beam]], or a hook on the roof. The torturer pulls on this rope until the victim is hanging from the arms. Since the hands are tied behind the victim's back, this will cause a very intense pain and possible [[dislocation (medicine)|dislocation]] of the arms.&lt;ref name="cassar"/&gt;&lt;ref name="illum2016-07-08"/&gt;&lt;ref name="maestrogianni"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Attard|first1=Christian|title=The sad end of Maestro Gianni - A Neapolitan Buonavoglia and Sculptor|journal=Treasures of Malta|date=2013|issue=56|volume=XIX|url=https://www.academia.edu/7166765/The_Sad_end_of_Giovanni_Puglisi_-_A_Neapolitan_Buonavoglia_and_Sculptor|page=49|publisher=Fondazzjoni Patrimonju Malti|issn=1028-3013|oclc=	499647242|location=Valletta}}&lt;/ref&gt; The full weight of the subject's body is then supported by the extended and internally rotated shoulder sockets. While the technique shows no external injuries, it can cause long-term [[nerve]], [[ligament]], or [[tendon]] damage. The technique typically causes [[brachial plexus injury]], leading to [[paralysis]] or loss of sensation in the arms.

The second variation, known as squassation, is similar to the first, but a series of drops are added, meaning that the victim is allowed to drop until his or her fall is suddenly checked by the rope.&lt;ref name="borg-muscat"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Borg-Muscat|first1=David|title=Prison life in Malta in the 18th century – Valletta's Gran Prigione|journal=Storja|date=2001|pages=48–49|url=http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Storja/Storja2001/05s.pdf|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160416102655/http://melitensiawth.com/incoming/Index/Storja/Storja2001/05s.pdf|archivedate=16 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In addition to the damage caused by the suspension, the painful jerk would cause major stress to the extended and vulnerable arms, leading to broken shoulders. It is believed that [[Niccolò Machiavelli]], during his 1513 imprisonment after allegedly conspiring against the [[Medici]] family in [[Florence]], was subjected to this form of strappado.

In the third variant, the victim's hands are tied to the front. The victim is also hung from the hands, but the ankles are tied and a heavy weight is attached to them. This will cause pain and possible damage not only to the arms, but also to the legs and hips.

==History==
According to [[William Godwin]], [[Girolamo Savonarola]] was tortured by strappado multiple times before being put to death in a [[trial by ordeal]] (fire); Savonarola, however, apparently renounced his confessions after being tortured, which eventually led to his sentence of [[Death by burning|burning at the stake]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=John Abraham|last=Heraud|author-link=John Abraham Heraud|title=The life and times of Girolamo Savonarola: illustrating the progress of the Reformation in Italy, during the fifteenth century|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=n9wEAAAAYAAJ|year=1843|publisher=Whittaker|page=371}}&lt;/ref&gt;
This device was thought to be used during the [[Salem Witch Trials]] of Salem, Massachusetts in 1692 to torture accused witches.

==Modern instances==
[[File:Metallstange-zur-Folterung.jpg|thumb|upright|A sculpture depicting strappado]]
In the [[Sachsenhausen concentration camp]], prisoners were punished by having their hands tied behind their back, and then being suspended on a pole with their feet just above the ground for half an hour. This was also systematically used in [[Dachau Concentration Camp]] for infringement of camp rules. Originally the punishment used tree branches, but it was moved into a shower room on special poles so that victims could not relieve the pain as they could by using the tree. Holocaust survivor [[Jean Améry]] writes of his own experiences of strappado when being tortured at the Nazi concentration camp of Fort Breendonk in occupied Belgium. Améry's analytical descriptions of the torture were included in a number of works by the writer [[W. G. Sebald]] (notably the novel ''Austerlitz'').

The "ropes" was one of several torture methods employed at the Hỏa Lò Prison, popularly known as the [[Hanoi Hilton]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2005/12/25/magazine/25stockdale.html "The Prisoner"], ''New York Times''.&lt;/ref&gt;  The site was used by the [[North Vietnamese Army]] to house, torture and interrogate captured servicemen, mostly American [[airmen]] shot down during bombing raids (including [[USAF]] officer [[Joseph Kittinger]], and [[US Navy]] pilot [and later [[US Senator]]] [[John McCain#Prisoner of war|John McCain]]).&lt;ref name="karnow-655"&gt;{{cite book | last=Karnow | first=Stanley | authorlink=Stanley Karnow | title=Vietnam: A History | publisher=[[The Viking Press]] | year=1983 | isbn=0-670-74604-5}} p. 655.&lt;/ref&gt; The aim of the torture was usually not acquiring military information; rather, it was to break the will of the prisoners, both individually and as a group, and to get written or recorded statements from the prisoners who criticized U.S.&amp;nbsp;conduct of the war and praised how the [[North Vietnam]]ese treated them.&lt;ref name="afm-valor"&gt;Hubbell, ''P.O.W.'', pp. 288–306.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to a 1997 [[Human Rights Watch]] report, this technique was "widely employed" by the security forces of [[Turkey]], where it is "usually used together with high-pressure water, electric shock, beating, or [[sexual molestation]] such as squeezing the [[testicle]]s or breast or placing a [[Baton (law enforcement)|nightstick]] against or in the [[vagina]] or [[anus]]".&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.hrw.org/reports/1997/turkey/Turkey-04.htm#P176_36663 TURKEY: TORTURE AND MISTREATMENT IN PRE-TRIAL DETENTION BY ANTI-TERROR POLICE - Techniques of Abuse]&lt;/ref&gt; In 1996, the [[European Court of Human Rights]] found Turkey guilty of torture for its use of reverse hanging.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.hrcr.org/safrica/freedom_security/aksoy_turkey.html ''Aksoy v.

In biology, two related [[species]] or [[populations]] are considered '''sympatric''' when they exist in the same geographic area and thus frequently encounter one another.{{Sfn|Futuyma|2009|pp=448, G-9}} An initially interbreeding population that splits into two or more distinct species sharing a common range exemplifies [[sympatric speciation]]. Such speciation may be a product of [[reproductive isolation]]&amp;nbsp;– which prevents hybrid offspring from being viable or able to reproduce, thereby reducing [[gene flow]]&amp;nbsp;– that results in genetic divergence.{{Sfn|Futuyma|2009|p=241}} Sympatric speciation does not imply secondary contact, which is [[speciation]] or divergence in [[allopatry]] followed by range expansions leading to an area of sympatry. Sympatric species or taxa in secondary contact may or may not [[hybrid (biology)|interbreed]].

==Types of populations==
Four main types of population pairs exist in nature. Sympatric populations (or species) contrast with [[parapatric]] populations, which contact one another in adjacent but not shared ranges and do not interbreed; peripatric species, which are separated only by areas in which neither organism occurs; and [[allopatric]] species, which occur in entirely distinct ranges that are neither adjacent nor overlapping.{{Sfn|Futuyma|2009|pp=487–490}} Allopatric populations isolated from one another by geographical factors (e.g., mountain ranges or bodies of water) may experience genetic—and, ultimately, phenotypic—changes in response to their varying environments. These may drive [[allopatric speciation]], which is arguably the dominant mode of speciation.{{citation needed|date = August 2012}}

==Evolving definitions and controversy==
The lack of geographic isolation as a definitive barrier between sympatric species has yielded controversy among ecologists, biologists, and zoologists regarding the validity of the term. As such, researchers have long debated the conditions under which sympatry truly applies, especially with respect to [[parasitism]]. Because parasitic organisms often inhabit multiple hosts during a life cycle, evolutionary biologist [[Ernst Mayr]] stated that internal parasites existing within different hosts demonstrate allopatry, not sympatry. Today, however, many biologists consider parasites and their hosts to be sympatric (see examples below). Conversely, zoologist [[Michael J. D. White]] considered two populations sympatric if genetic interbreeding was viable within the habitat overlap. This may be further specified as sympatry occurring within one [[Deme (biology)|deme]]; that is, reproductive individuals must be able to locate one another in the same population in order to be sympatric.

Others question the ability of sympatry to result in complete speciation: until recently, many researchers considered it nonexistent, doubting that selection alone could create disparate, but not geographically separated, species. In 2003, biologist Karen McCoy suggested that sympatry can act as a mode of speciation only when "the probability of mating between two individuals depend[s] [solely] on their genotypes, [and the genes are] dispersed throughout the range of the population during the period of reproduction".{{sfn|McCoy|2003}} In essence, sympatric speciation does require very strong forces of [[natural selection]] to be acting on heritable traits, as there is no geographic isolation to aid in the splitting process. Yet, recent research has begun to indicate that sympatric speciation is not as uncommon as was once assumed.

Syntopy is a special case of sympatry. It means the joint occurrence of two [[species]] in the same [[habitat]] at the same time. Just as the broader term sympatry, "syntopy" is used especially for close species that might [[Hybridisation (biology)|hybridise]] or even be [[sister species]]. ''Sympatric'' species occur together in the same region, but do not necessarily share the same localities as ''syntopic'' species do. Areas of syntopy are of interest because they allow to study how similar species may coexist without [[competition (biology)|outcompeting]] each other.

As an example, the two bat species ''[[Myotis auriculus]]'' and ''[[Myotis evotis|M. evotis]]'' were found to be syntopic in North America.&lt;ref name="Gannon1998"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Gannon |first1=William L. |title=Syntopy between two species of long-eared bats (''Myotis evotis'' and ''Myotis auriculus'') |journal=The Southwestern Naturalist |volume=43 |issue=3 |year=1998 |pages=394–396 |jstor=30055386}}&lt;/ref&gt; In contrast, the [[marbled newt]] and the [[northern crested newt]] have a large sympatric range in western France, but differ in their habitat preferences and only rarely occur syntopically in the same breeding ponds.&lt;ref name="SchoorlZuiderwijk1980"&gt;{{cite journal |last1=Schoorl |first1=Jaap |last2=Zuiderwijk |first2=Annie |title=Ecological isolation in ''Triturus cristatus'' and ''Triturus marmoratus'' (Amphibia: Salamandridae) |journal=Amphibia-Reptilia |volume=1 |issue=3 |year=1980 |pages=235–252 |issn=0173-5373 |doi=10.1163/156853881X00357}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Sympatric speciation==
[[File:Speciation modes.svg|thumb|360px|Different modes of [[speciation]]]]
{{Main|Sympatric speciation}}
The lack of geographic constraint in isolating sympatric populations implies that the emerging species avoid interbreeding via other mechanisms. Before speciation is complete, two diverging populations may still produce viable offspring. As speciation progresses, [[isolating mechanisms]]&amp;nbsp;– such as gametic incompatibility that renders fertilization of the egg impossible&amp;nbsp;– are selected for in order to increase the reproductive divide between the two populations.

===Species discrimination===
Sympatric groups frequently show a greater ability to discriminate between their own species and other closely related species than do allopatric groups. This is shown in the study of [[hybrid zone]]s. It is also apparent in the differences in levels of prezygotic isolation (by factors that prevent formation of a viable [[zygote]]) in both sympatric and allopatric populations. There are two main theories regarding this process: 1) differential fusion, which suggests that only populations with a keen ability to discriminate between species will persist in sympatry; and 2) [[character displacement]], which implies that distinguishing characteristics will be heightened in areas where the species co-occur in order to facilitate discrimination.

====Reinforcement====
Reinforcement is the process by which natural selection reinforces reproductive isolation. In sympatry, reinforcement increases species discrimination and sexual adaptation in order to avoid maladaptive [[hybrid (biology)|hybridization]] and encourage speciation. If hybrid offspring are either sterile or less-fit than non-hybrid offspring, mating between members of two different species will be selected against. Natural selection decreases the probability of such hybridization by selecting for the ability to identify mates of one's own species from those of another species.

====Reproductive character displacement====
Reproductive character displacement strengthens the reproductive barriers between sympatric species by encouraging the divergence of traits that are crucial to reproduction. Divergence is frequently distinguished by [[assortative mating]] between individuals of the two species.{{sfn|Dieckmann|Doebeli|1999}} For example, divergence in the mating signals of two species will limit hybridization by reducing one's ability to identify an individual of the second species as a potential mate. Support for the reproductive character displacement hypothesis comes from observations of sympatric species in overlapping habitats in nature. Increased prezygotic isolation, which is associated with reproductive character displacement, has been observed in cicadas of genus ''[[Magicicada]]'', [[stickleback]] fish, and the flowering plants of the genus ''[[Phlox]]''.

====Differential fusion====
An alternative explanation for species discrimination in sympatry is differential fusion. This hypothesis states that of the many species have historically come into contact with one another, the only ones that persist in sympatry (and thus are seen today) are species with strong mating discrimination. On the other hand, species lacking strong mating discrimination are assumed to have fused while in contact, forming one distinct species.

Differential fusion is less widely recognized than character displacement, and several of its implications are refuted by experimental evidence. For example, differential fusion implies greater postzygotic isolation among sympatric species, as this functions to prevent fusion between the species. However, Coyne and Orr found equal levels of postzygotic isolation among sympatric and allopatric species pairs in closely related ''[[Drosophila]]''.{{sfn|Coyne|Orr|1989}} Nevertheless, differential fusion remains a possible, though not complete, contributor to species discrimination.{{sfn|Noor|1999}}

==Examples==
Sympatry has been increasingly evidenced in current research. Because of this, [[sympatric speciation]]&amp;nbsp;– which was once highly debated among researchers&amp;nbsp;– is progressively gaining credibility as a viable form of speciation.

===Orca: partial sympatry===
Several distinct types of [[killer whale]] (''Orcinus orca''), which are characterized by an array of morphological and behavioral differences, live in sympatry throughout the North Atlantic, North Pacific and Antarctic oceans. In the North Pacific, three whale [[population]]s&amp;nbsp;– called "transient", "resident", and "offshore"&amp;nbsp;– demonstrate partial sympatry, crossing paths with relative frequency. The results of recent genetic analyses using [[mitochondrial DNA|mtDNA]] indicate that this is due to secondary contact, in which the three types encountered one another following the bidirectional migration of "offshore" and "resident" whales between the North Atlantic and North Pacific. Partial sympatry in these whales is, therefore, not the result of speciation. Furthermore, killer whale populations that consist of all three types have been documented in the Atlantic, evidencing that interbreeding occurs among them. Thus, secondary contact does not always result in total [[reproductive isolation]], as has often been predicted.{{sfn|Foote|Morin|Durban|Willerslev|2011}}

===Great spotted cuckoo and magpie: brood parasitism===
The parasitic [[great spotted cuckoo]] (''Clamator glandarius'') and its [[magpie]] host, both native to Southern Europe, are completely sympatric species. However, the duration of their sympatry varies with location. For example, great spotted cuckoos and their magpie hosts in Hoya de Gaudix, southern Spain, have lived in sympatry since the early 1960s, while species in other locations have more recently become sympatric. Great spotted cuckoos, when in South Africa, are sympatric with at least 8 species of starling and 2 crows, [[pied crow]] and [[Cape crow]].{{sfn|Roberts|Tarboton|2011}}

The great spotted cuckoo exhibits [[brood parasite|brood parasitism]] by laying a mimicked version of the magpie egg in the magpie's nest. Since cuckoo eggs hatch before magpie eggs, magpie hatchlings must compete with cuckoo hatchlings for resources provided by the magpie mother. This relationship between the cuckoo and the magpie in various locations can be characterized as either recently sympatric or anciently sympatric. The results of an experiment by Soler and Moller (1990) showed that in areas of ancient sympatry (species in cohabitation for many generations), magpies were more likely to reject most of the cuckoo eggs, as these magpies had developed [[counter-adaptations]] that aid in identification of egg type. In areas of recent sympatry, magpies rejected comparatively fewer cuckoo eggs. Thus, sympatry can cause [[host-parasite coevolution|coevolution]], by which both species undergo genetic changes due to the selective pressures that one species exerts on the other.{{sfn|Soler|Moller|1990}}

===''Acromyrmex'' ant: isolation of fungal gardens===
[[Leafcutter ant]]s protect and nourish various species of fungus as a source of food in a system known as [[ant-fungus mutualism]]. Leafcutter ants belonging to the genus ''[[Acromyrmex]]'' are known for their mutualistic relationship with [[Basidiomycete]] fungi. Ant colonies are closely associated with their fungus colonies, and may have [[coevolution|co-evolved]] with a consistent vertical lineage of fungi in individual colonies. Ant populations defend against the [[horizontal transmission]] of foreign fungi to their fungal colony, as this transmission may lead to competitive stress on the local fungal garden.  Invaders are identified and removed by the ant colony, inhibiting competition and fungal interbreeding. This active isolation of individual populations helps maintain the genetic purity of the fungal colony, and this mechanism may lead to [[sympatric speciation]] within a shared habitat.{{sfn|Bot|Rehner|Boomsma|2001}}

{{nihongo|'''Tatsuo Miyajima'''|宮島 達男|Miyajima Tatsuo|January 16, 1957 – }} is a [[Japan]]ese [[sculpture|sculptor]] and [[installation art]]ist who lives in [[Moriya, Ibaraki|Moriya]], in [[Ibaraki Prefecture|Ibaraki]] prefecture, [[Japan]]. His work frequently employs digital [[LED]] counters and is primarily concerned with the function and significance of time and space, especially within the context of [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] thought.

==Early life==
Miyajima was born in [[Edogawa, Tokyo|Edogawa City]], [[Tokyo]] on January 16, 1957. He graduated from the Oil Painting course in the Fine Arts department of [[Tokyo National University of Fine Arts and Music]] in 1984, and completed his MA at the same university in 1986.&lt;ref name="lissongallery.com"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.lissongallery.com/artists/tatsuo-miyajima/cv|title=Tatsuo Miyajima CV {{!}} Artists {{!}} Lisson Gallery|website=www.lissongallery.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Work==
Although Miyajima originally trained as a [[painting|painter]], and briefly considered himself to be a [[performance art]]ist, the majority of his work now takes the form of [[installation art|installation]] and [[sculpture]]. He has admitted that, in effect, his work now "performs" on his behalf.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.standard.co.uk/arts/tatsuo-miyajima-is-keeper-of-the-light-fantastic-6801850.html|title=Tatsuo Miyajima is keeper of the light fantastic|work=Evening Standard|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; His core artistic concepts are: "Keep Changing, Connect with Everything, Continue Forever."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://tatsuomiyajima.com/concepts/|title=Concepts|work=Tatsuo Miyajima|access-date=2018-07-19|language=ja-JP}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early Work===

In 1970s, Miyajima practised performance art.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.artangel.org.uk/projects/1995/running_time_clear_zero/about_the_artist/tatsuo_miyajima|title=Running Time / Clear Zero|website=www.artangel.org.uk|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was initially influenced by the work of [[Joseph Beuys]], [[Allan Krapow]] and [[Christo]], and considered his performance work as an "action for society".&lt;ref name=friezearticle&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/keep_changing_connect_with_everything |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2014-12-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141211135749/http://www.frieze.com/issue/article/keep_changing_connect_with_everything/ |archivedate=2014-12-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The desire to create more enduring work - in contrast to the necessarily ephemeral nature of his performance and actions - motivated him to begin working on sculpture and installations.&lt;ref name = friezearticle /&gt;

===LED works===

Miyajima made his first LED counter in 1988; this has formed the basis for much of his later work.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artists/tatsuo-miyajima-2300|title=Tatsuo Miyajima born 1957 {{!}} Tate|last=Tate|work=Tate|access-date=2018-07-19|language=en-GB}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, a block will display two digits in red or green, and count from 1 to 99. The counters never register zero, because, for Miyajima, the idea of [[zero (number)|zero]] is a purely Western concept.&lt;ref name = friezearticle /&gt;  He has subsequently linked together different displays so that they can respond to each other; he calls these systems 'regions'.

==Exhibitions==
Miyajima's first solo exhibitions include "Human Stone" at Gallery Parergon, Tokyo in 1983, and "Time" at Maki Gallery, Tokyo in 1986.&lt;ref name="lissongallery.com"/&gt; More recently he has shown at [[Modern Art Museum of Fort Worth]] (1996), [[Fondation Cartier pour l'Art Contemporain]] (1996), [[San Francisco Museum of Modern Art]] (1997), [[Miyanomori Art Museum]], Hokkaido (2010), and [[Ullens Center for Contemporary Art]],  Beijing (2011).&lt;ref name="lissongallery.com" /&gt;

He has exhibited as part of numerous group exhibitions, notably the [[Venice Biennale]] in 1988 and 1999, as well [[Hiroshima City Museum of Contemporary Art]] (2008), and [[Museum of Contemporary Art, Sydney]] (2012).&lt;ref name="lissongallery.com" /&gt;

==Art market==
Miyajima is represented by Buchmann Galerie&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.buchmanngalerie.com/artists/tatsuo-miyajima/works|title=Tatsuo Miyajima – Works {{!}} Buchmann Galerie|website=www.buchmanngalerie.com|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Lisson Gallery]].&lt;ref name="lissongallery.com" /&gt; In 2010, one of Miyajima's works, "T. L. Sakura", was sold for $375,173 at [[Christie's]] Hong Kong.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?intObjectID=5385692|title=TATSUO MIYAJIMA|language=en|access-date=2018-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent''''' is an influential essay, part of the essay collection ''The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent, and Other Essays'' published in 1915 by [[John Erskine (educator)|John Erskine]], English professor at [[Columbia University]].{{Sfn|Graff|1989|p=278}}{{Sfn|Rubin|1992|p=161}}

The essay was first read before the [[Phi Beta Kappa Society]] of [[Amherst College]], where Erskine taught before joining Columbia. {{Sfn|Erskine|1992|p=vii}} Later, it was published in quarterly magazine ''[[The Hibbert Journal]]'' in 1914. {{Sfn|Trilling|2008|p=x}}{{Sfn|Erskine|1992|p=vii}} During his tenure at Columbia  from 1909 and 1937, Erskine formulated General Honors Course. In the early 1920s he started teaching a ''great books'' course at Columbia,  which later founded the influential [[Great Books]] movement.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

==History==
In 1963, the essay was published in the ''[[Gateway to the Great Books]]'' - Volume 10: Philosophical Essays, a 10-volume book series published by [[Encyclopædia Britannica Inc.]] in 1963.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| title = Gateway to the Great Books |publisher=Centre for Study of Great Ideas| url = http://www.thegreatideas.org/gbgateway.html | accessdate = 2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Subsequently it was also included in the book of selected essays also titled ''The Moral Obligation to Be Intelligent: Selected Essays'' (New York: Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux) published posthumously in 2000),  edited by [[Lionel Trilling]], another Columbia faculty and literary critic, and had an introduction by critic [[Leon Wieseltier]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Night Vision by Andrew Delbanco |publisher= The New York Review of Books | url = http://www.nybooks.com/articles/archives/2001/jan/11/night-vision/ |author=Andrew Delbanco|date= January 11, 2001|accessdate = 2014-05-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Trilling was one of Erskine's students and later taught the "Great Books" course himself; he chose the essay as the lead and the title as it characterized the essence his selection. {{Sfn|Kimmage|2009|p=322}}&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web |author=Richard Gilman|authorlink=Richard Gilman|title=The Foremost Authority |url=http://partners.nytimes.com/books/00/09/24/reviews/000924.24gilmant.html |date=September 24, 2000 |publisher=New York Times |accessdate=2014-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''visual workplace''' is a continuous improvement paradigm that is closely related to [[Lean manufacturing|Lean]], the [[Toyota Production System]] (TPS), and [[operational excellence]] yet offers its own comprehensive methodology for significant financial and cultural improvement gains. Introduced by [[Gwendolyn Galsworth]] in her 1997 book ''Visual Systems,''.,&lt;ref name="Galsworth, Gwendolyn 1997"&gt;Galsworth, Gwendolyn (1997) ''Visual Systems: Harnessing the Power of a Visual Workplace'' AMACOM {{ISBN|978-0814403204}}&lt;/ref&gt; this system integrates and codifies the many iterations of visuality in the world of continuous improvement.

==Brief History of Visual Information Sharing==

Visual communication rests on the natural inclination of humans to use pictures, graphics, and other images to quickly and simply convey meaning and understand information. For instance, look at the practices and applications that civil engineers have developed to handle complex human interaction on our roads and highways,&lt;ref&gt;[http://mutcd.fhwa.dot.gov ''Manual on Uniform Traffic Control Devices''] Retrieved on 22 June 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; as well as the entire field of [[wayfinding]] in public spaces &lt;ref&gt;[http://onlinepubs.trb.org/onlinepubs/acrp_rpt_052.pdf ''Wayfinding &amp; Signing Guidelines for Airport Terminals''] Retrieved 23 Aug 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The same logic eventually migrated into the workplace, notably in post-war Japan, and most saliently at Toyoda Motors where visual applications (visual devices) became a commonplace element in the Toyota Production System (TPS).&lt;ref&gt;Hirano, H. (1995) ''5 Pillars of the Visual Workplace,'' Productivity Press {{ISBN|978-1563270475}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other leading companies in Japan, such as Canon and Okidata, adopted many of the same practices. However, while visibility was clearly a part of Japan's success solution, it was only noticed—or cited in the literature—as a generalized principle and not a codified system or a framework of thinking. For example, Dr. Robert W. Hall, in his 1983 book, ''Zero Inventories,'' states: "Establishing visibility of all forms of production problems is very important. ...The entire idea is instant communication."&lt;ref&gt;Hall, Robert W. (1983). ''Zero Inventories,'' Homewood, Ill., Dow Jones-Irwin {{ISBN|978-0870944611}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Specifically, Japan's JIT (just-in-time) manufacturing approach had an easy-to-understand visual interface: andon (stacked lights) kanban (pick-up tickets for control material quantity), color-coding (to make the match between items), scheduling boards for daily production, easy-to-read labels on shelving, and lines on the floor to trace out locations.&lt;ref&gt;Hirano, H.(1988) ''JIT Factory,'' {{ISBN|978-0870944611}} Productivity Press&lt;/ref&gt;

Japanese master practitioners also noted that visual devices made it easy to see the difference between normal and abnormal: "…abnormal conditions and problems need to be obvious enough to catch people's attention. Because of the emphasis on visual methods for quick information transfer, the practice is called ’management by sight’ or ‘visual control’." &lt;ref name=Suzaki&gt;Suzaki, Kiyoshi (1987) ''The New Manufacturing Challenge'' The Free Press {{ISBN|978-1451697551}}&lt;/ref&gt; Suzaki also compared the responsiveness of a well-tuned production system with the way the human body responds to stimuli and problems: "…Corrective action is taken right away, just as our muscles pull our hand away when we touch a hot plate."&lt;ref name=Suzaki/&gt;

Michel Greif's book, ''The Visual Factory'' &lt;ref&gt;Greif, Michel (1997) ''The Visual Factory'' Productivity Press {{ISBN|978-0915299676}}&lt;/ref&gt; conferred the name for the first time, though Dr. Greif's theme focused primarily on the ability of visual applications to increase the interest of hourly workers in their own performance and their participation in company improvement activities.

==A Codified System of Visual Functions==
Throughout this period (1983–1991), [[Gwendolyn Galsworth]] was head of training and development at Productivity Inc. in Cambridge, Massachusetts, a publishing, training, and consulting firm known for bringing the work of Japan's manufacturing leaders to the United StatesGalsworth headed study missions to Japan and observed visuality in Japan first-hand. She also had the opportunity of working one-on-one with many of Japan's seminal thinkers, including [[Taiichi Ohno]], Ryuji Fukuda, and [[Shigeo Shingo]]. Dr. Shingo personally tasked Galsworth with developing his mistake proofing/poka-yoke methodology for western companies.&lt;ref&gt;Shingo, Shigeo (1986) ''Zero Quality Control'' Productivity Press {{ISBN|978-0915299072}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was the synthesis of all these factors and influences that lead Dr. Galsworth to develop and codify the many threads of visuality into a coherent methodology of the visual workplace.

The visual workplace, then, is an overall operational strategy and philosophy, geared to help organizations continually achieve their goals through visual devices and systems. Galsworth continues to be the main driving force behind the practice and articulation of workplace visuality, along with a network of individuals and companies loosely coupled as visual workplace practitioners around the world. The visual workplace is a large body of knowledge and know-how, with a strong guiding philosophy of continuous improvement with an emphasis on the centrality of the individual in the prosperity of the enterprise.

==Basic Principles==

While virtually all major improvement paradigms in use in the West incorporate some element of visuality, the entire codified set of visual principles and practices, from the foundation of 5S through to visual guarantees (poka-yoke), rests on this definition: "The visual workplace is a self-ordering, self-explaining, self-regulating, and self-improving work environment—where what is supposed to happen does happen, on time, every time, day or night—because of visual devices."&lt;ref&gt;Galsworth, Gwendolyn (2005) ''Visual Workplace, Visual Thinking,'' Visual-Lean Enterprise Press {{ISBN|978-1932516012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A visual workplace is defined by devices designed to visually share information about organizational operations in order to make human and machine performance safer, more exact, more repeatable, and more reliable. The more the process becomes visual, the more production velocity increases.&lt;ref&gt;Galsworth, Gwendolyn (2011) ''Work that Makes Sense: Operator-Led Visuality'' Visual-Lean Press {{ISBN|978-1932516302}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This is accomplished in parallel with generating new levels of employee engagement and contribution, which in turn lead to improved alignment within the enterprise and significant bottom line benefits. In an effective visual workplace, this level of information can be seen and understood without coaching, supervision or the need for an explanation—at best, without speaking a word.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/12/30/jobs/the-visual-workplace-and-how-to-build-it.html?_r=0 ''Don't Just Talk About Change, Show It.''] Retrieved 23 Aug 2016.&lt;/ref&gt;

The key principle is to install vital information visually as close to the point of use as possible. When a step-by-step methodology is applied, the visual workplace targets the elimination of the seventh waste, ''motion'', defined as ''moving without working.''&lt;ref name="Galsworth, Gwendolyn 1997"/&gt;

Originally implemented and refined in manufacturing settings, the concept of the visual workplace is now taking hold in such wide-ranging venues as libraries&lt;ref&gt;Raab, Christian [http://creativelibrarypractice.org/2013/02/11/library-as-visual-workplace/ ''The Library as Visual Workplace''] Retrieved Aug 2016.&lt;/ref&gt; and hospitals.&lt;ref&gt;Graban, Mark (2012) ''Lean Hospitals'' Productivity Press {{ISBN|9781439870433}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In [[logic]], an [[argument]] is '''valid''' if and only if it takes a form that makes it impossible for the [[premise|premises]] to be true and the conclusion nevertheless to be false.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.iep.utm.edu/val-snd/ Validity and Soundness – Internet Encyclopedia of Philosophy]&lt;/ref&gt; It is not required that a valid argument have premises that are actually true,&lt;ref&gt;Jc Beall and Greg Restall, [http://plato.stanford.edu/archives/fall2014/entries/logical-consequence/ "Logical Consequence"], The Stanford Encyclopedia of Philosophy (Fall 2014 Edition).&lt;/ref&gt; but to have premises that, if they were true, would guarantee the truth of the argument's conclusion. A [[well-formed formula|formula]] is valid [[if and only if]] it is true under every [[interpretation (logic)|interpretation]], and an argument form (or schema) is valid if and only if every argument of that [[logical form]] is valid.

==Arguments==

An  [[argument]] is valid if and only if the truth of its premises [[Logical consequence|entails]] the truth of its conclusion and each step, sub-argument, or logical operation in the argument is valid.  Under such conditions it would be self-contradictory to affirm the premises and deny the conclusion.  The [[corresponding conditional]] of a valid argument is a [[logical truth]] and the negation of its corresponding conditional is a [[contradiction]]. The conclusion is a [[logical consequence]] of its premises.

An argument that is not valid is said to be "invalid".

An example of a valid argument is given by the following well-known [[syllogism]]:
: All men are mortal.
: Socrates is a man.
: Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

What makes this a valid argument is not that it has true premises and a true conclusion, but the logical necessity of the conclusion, given the two premises. The argument would be just as valid were the premises and conclusion false. The following argument is of the same [[logical form]] but with false premises and a false conclusion, and it is equally valid:

: All cups are green.
: Socrates is a cup.
: Therefore, Socrates is green.

No matter how the universe might be constructed, it could never be the case that these arguments should turn out to have simultaneously true premises but a false conclusion.  The above arguments may be contrasted with the following invalid one:

: All men are immortal.
: Socrates is a man.
: Therefore, Socrates is mortal.

In this case, the conclusion contradicts the deductive logic of the preceding premises, rather than deriving from it. Therefore, the argument is logically 'invalid', even though the conclusion could be considered 'true' in general terms. The premise 'All men are immortal' would likewise be deemed false outside of the framework of classical logic. However, within that system 'true' and 'false' essentially function more like mathematical states such as binary 1s and 0s than the philosophical concepts normally associated with those terms.

A standard view is that whether an argument is valid is a matter of the argument's [[logical form]].  Many techniques are employed by logicians to represent an argument's logical form.  A simple example, applied to two of the above illustrations, is the following:  Let the letters 'P', 'Q', and 'S' stand, respectively, for the set of men, the set of mortals, and Socrates.  Using these symbols, the first argument may be abbreviated as:

: All P are Q.
: S is a P.
: Therefore, S is a Q.

Similarly, the third argument becomes:

: All P are not Q.
: S is a P.
: Therefore, S is a Q.

An argument is termed formally valid if it has structural self-consistency, i.e. if when the operands between premises are all true, the derived conclusion is always also true. In the third example, the initial premises cannot logically result in the conclusion and is therefore categorized as an invalid argument.

==Valid formula==
{{Main|Well-formed formula}}

A formula of a [[formal language]] is a valid formula if and only if it is true under every possible [[Interpretation (logic)|interpretation]] of the language. In propositional logic, they are [[tautology (logic)|tautologies]].

==Statements==
A statement can be called valid, i.e. logical truth, if it is true in all interpretations.

==Soundness==

Validity of deduction is not affected by the truth of the premise or the truth of the conclusion. The following deduction is perfectly valid:

: All animals live on Mars.
: All humans are animals.
: Therefore, all humans live on Mars.

The problem with the argument is that it is not ''[[soundness|sound]]''.  In order for a deductive argument to be sound, the deduction must be valid and '''all'''  the premises true.

==Satisfiability==
{{Main|Satisfiability}}

[[Model theory]] analyzes formulae with respect to particular classes of interpretation in suitable mathematical structures.  On this reading, formula is valid if all such interpretations make it true.  An inference is valid if all interpretations that validate the premises validate the conclusion.  This is known as ''semantic validity''.&lt;ref&gt;L. T. F. Gamut, ''Logic, Language, and Meaning: Introduction to Logic'', University of Chicago Press, 1991, p. 115.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Preservation==

In '''truth-preserving''' validity, the interpretation under which all variables are assigned a [[truth value]] of 'true' produces a truth value of 'true'.

In a '''false-preserving''' validity, the interpretation under which all variables are assigned a truth value of 'false' produces a truth value of 'false'.&lt;ref&gt;Robert Cogan, ''Critical Thinking: Step by Step'', University Press of America, 1998, [https://books.google.com/books?id=Fit9rjXiLBUC&amp;pg=PA48 p. 48].&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Women's fear of crime''' refers to women's fear of being a victim of crime, independent of actual [[Victimisation|victimization]]. Although [[fear of crime]] is a concern for people of all genders, studies consistently find that women around the world tend to have much higher levels of fear of crime than men, despite the fact that in many places, and for most offenses, men's actual victimization rates are higher.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Stanko|first=Elizabeth A.|date=1995|title=Women, Crime, and Fear|jstor=1048395|journal=The Annals of the American Academy of Political and Social Science|volume=539|pages=46–58|doi=10.1177/0002716295539001004}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Gender of Crime|last=Britton|first=Dana|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|year=2011|isbn=978-1-4422-0970-1|location=Lanham, MD|pages=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; Fear of crime is related to perceived risk of victimization, but is not the same; fear of crime may be generalized instead of referring to specific offenses, and perceived risk may also be considered a demographic factor that contributes to fear of crime. Women tend to have higher levels for both perceived risk and fear of crime.&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Snedker|first=Karen A.|date=2015|title=Neighborhood Conditions and Fear of Crime A Reconsideration of Sex Differences|url=http://cad.sagepub.com/content/61/1/45|journal=Crime &amp; Delinquency|language=en|volume=61|issue=1|pages=45–70|doi=10.1177/0011128710389587|issn=0011-1287}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Addington|first=Lynn A.|title=Fear of Crime and Perceived Risk|url=http://www.oxfordbibliographies.com/display/id/obo-9780195396607-0051|journal=Oxford Bibliographies Online Datasets|doi=10.1093/obo/9780195396607-0051|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In women's everyday lives, fear of crime can have negative effects, such as reducing their environmental mobility. Studies have shown that women tend to avoid certain behaviors, such as walking alone at night, because they are fearful of crime, and would feel more comfortable with these behaviors if they felt safer.&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Keane|first=Carl|date=1998|title=Evaluating the Influence of Fear of Crime as an Environmental Mobility Restrictor on Women's Routine Activities|url=http://eab.sagepub.com/content/30/1/60|journal=Environment and Behavior|language=en|volume=30|issue=1|pages=60–74|doi=10.1177/0013916598301003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Theories on women's fear of crime ==
Social scientists have differing views on the causes of women's fear of crime. Some have argued that women's heightened fear of crime is due to women's higher levels physical vulnerability compared to men, although [[Feminism|feminist]] work generally resists this generalization and often tries to relocate the cause to larger societal factors.&lt;ref name=":10"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Coping with Crime: Individual and Neighborhood Reactions|last=Skogan|first=Wesley G.|last2=Maxfield|first2=Michael G.|publisher=Sage Publications|year=1981|isbn=0-8039-1632-9|series=Sage Library of Social Research 124|location=Beverly Hills, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It is nonetheless important that most women are aware of pervasive cultural view that women are more vulnerable than men, which may make them think they are more likely to be victimized and therefore contribute to their fear; in this way, it would be perceived vulnerability and not actual vulnerability that is the cause of women's fear.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt; Some research has also suggested that women are in fact not much more fearful about crime than men, but that dominant cultural ideas about masculinity may make men reluctant to talk about their fear or report it in surveys.&lt;ref name=":7"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Gilchrist|first=Elizabeth|last2=Bannister|first2=Jon|last3=Ditton|first3=Jason|last4=Farrall|first4=Stephen|date=1998|title=Women and the 'fear of crime': challenging the accepted stereotype|url=|journal=British Journal of Criminology|issue=38.2|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Feminist Theory ===
Feminist discourse on fear of crime tends to explain women's higher levels of fear with the [[Patriarchy|unequal gender structure]] in most societies, which places women beneath men within the power structure and thus puts them especially at risk for victimization by men.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; This theory refers to the oppressive [[social control]] of women, arguing that some crimes against women (such as rape) and the socialization that women receive to feel vulnerable and fear male violence are used by the patriarchy to assert male dominance and "keep women in their place."&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Rape and fear of crime ==
As rape is by far the most gendered crime by victimization, some feminist scholars have suggested that fear of rape is the most important and most unique element of women's fear of crime, or even that women's fear of crime is in fact a generalized fear of rape.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Warr|first=Mark|date=1984|title=Fear of Victimisation: Why Are Women and the Elderly More Afraid?|url=|journal=Social Science Quarterly|issue=65|pages=681–702|doi=|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The Female Fear|last=Gordon|first=Margaret T.|last2=Riger|first2=Stephanie|publisher=The Free Press|year=1989|isbn=0-02-912490-5|location=New York|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Proponents of this theory, often referred to as the "shadow of sexual assault hypothesis," often note that women tend to fear that rape will co-occur with other crimes, such as burglary, a fear that is not found among men.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Ferraro|first=Kenneth F.|date=1996|title=Women's fear of victimization: shadow of sexual assault?|url=|journal=Social Forces|issue=2|doi=10.1093/sf/75.2.667|pmid=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":8"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Chui|first=Wing Hong|last2=Cheng|first2=Kevin Kwok-Yin|last3=Wong|first3=Lok-Ping|date=2013|title=Gender, Fear of Crime, and Attitudes Toward Prisoners Among Social Work Majors in a Hong Kong University|url=http://ijo.sagepub.com/content/57/4/479|journal=International Journal of Offender Therapy and Comparative Criminology|language=|volume=57|issue=4|pages=479–494|doi=10.1177/0306624X12436524|issn=0306-624X|pmid=22334610}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some supporters of the theory also note that sexual harassment, which most women will experience in their lifetimes, especially contributes to the fear of rape; in some cases, women's rejection of unwanted sexual advances leads to threats, and even "benevolent" harassment may increase women's wariness and fear of men in public spaces.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The fear of rape, unlike other fears of specific crimes, is almost exclusive to women.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Among women, it is also one of the strongest crime-related fears, and is the strongest crime-related fear for young women.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; Levels of fear of rape vary among women by age, race/ethnicity, residential area, and other factors, but are especially high for women who have been victims of rape in the past or know victims personally (the latter group may include a significant portion of women, with one study estimating that over half of women know rape victims).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; The fear of rape may also be related to the fear of murder, as women tend to overestimate the proportion of rape victims who are murdered during their attacks. Stigma and blame are also factors: what many feminists refer to as the "[[rape myth]]," the popular idea that women can be blamed for their rape and that women are responsible for preventing rape by the regulation of their behavior, often serves to support the fear of rape.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

== Demographic differences in women's fear of crime ==
Although women as a whole demographic are more fearful of crime, specific subgroups of women may have higher levels of fear or be more likely to change their behavior because of it. In many studies, the demographics found to have the highest generalized fear of crime are single, older, urban, women of color, and of lower socioeconomic class.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt; For fear of victimization for specific crimes, the demographics with the highest levels of fear may be different.

=== Geography ===
Generally, research has demonstrated that women from urban areas have higher levels of fear of crime. Even within cities, fear levels may differ from neighborhood to neighborhood. Increased social disorganization in the neighborhood (as measured by homelessness, drug sales, vandalism, prostitution, etc.) and higher rates of neighborhood serious crime lead to higher levels of fear of crime for both men and women, but both factors have a stronger effect on women's fear of crime.&lt;ref name=":3" /&gt;

Urban and rural communities tend to have very different levels of fear of crime. Rural areas are almost always perceived by residents and outsiders as safer, so it is often assumed that fear of crime levels will be lower there. Still, 2005 research in New Zealand and the United Kingdom noted that fear of crime levels in rural areas is on the rise, and found that sources of fear of crime among rural women often include perceived encroachment of urban influence (through people or attitudes) into their communities.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Little|first=Jo|last2=Panelli|first2=Ruth|last3=Kraack|first3=Anna|date=2005|title=Women's fear of crime: A rural perspective|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S074301670500015X|journal=Journal of Rural Studies|volume=21|issue=2|pages=151–163|doi=10.1016/j.jrurstud.2005.02.001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Race/Ethnicity ===
Theorists have suggested that Black and Latina women, and women of color in general, in the United States may have higher rates of fear of crime due to increased [[social vulnerability]]; because of institutional racism and sexism against women of color, their identities may put them at greater risk of victimization, leading to higher levels of fear.&lt;ref name=":10" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

== Solutions to women's fear of crime ==
In general, proposed solutions to women's fear of crime either place the responsibility on individual women (through preventive strategies) or on official agencies (through infrastructure improvements, anti-rape education, more involved policing, etc.), and are often framed as a combination of both.&lt;ref name=":9"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hickey|first=Georgina|date=2011|title=From Civility to Self-Defense: Modern Advice to Women on the Privileges and Dangers of Public Space|jstor=41290280|journal=Women's Studies Quarterly|volume=39|issue=1/2|pages=77–94|doi=10.1353/wsq.2011.0021}}&lt;/ref&gt; Of those that expect women to protect themselves from crime, most focus on the dangers for women in public spaces; however, as women usually face their highest rates of victimization in the home or at the hands of known people, these campaigns have been suggested to be particularly ill-equipped to help solve the problem of women's high fear of crime, and to support an untrue picture of women's victimization.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

One of the most common individual strategies for dealing with fear of crime and preventing victimization is simple avoidance, the attempt to stay away from areas (such as dark alleys or public transportation) where it is believed victimization is likely to occur; research has found that women employ avoidance strategies more often than men do.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Avoided areas may include neighborhoods with high crime rates, but for many women also include any unfamiliar areas. Women may also employ other isolation strategies by avoiding social interaction with strangers, ignoring them or moving quickly and with purpose to discourage interaction&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Nothing Bad Happens to Good Girls: Fear of Crime in Women's Lives|last=Madriz|first=Esther|publisher=University of California Press|year=1997|isbn=0-520-20855-2|location=Berkeley, CA|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Another common method of allaying fear of crime among women is by "crime-proofing" homes or possessions. Popular examples include home security systems, locking away valuables, or participating in [[Neighborhood watch|neighborhood watch programs]]. These strategies are used by people of all genders, but some are more often employed by women. For example, many women in an American study reported choosing purses with zippers or holding purses protectively to defend against [[theft]] and purse-snatching.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

As interest in women's safety and women's fear of crime has increased, so has interest in precautionary strategies; for example, in the past few decades, women's [[self-defense]] classes, books, and other self-defense instruction have become increasingly popular.&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt; Some women also choose to carry weapons, such as knives or guns, or repellents like [[pepper spray]] and [[Mace (spray)|Mace]] to ward off potential attackers.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

Feminist commentators usually take the view that the responsibility for reducing women's fear of crime lies with the society, and that fear must be combatted at its source by addressing men's violence against women.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

== Women's fear of crime around the world ==
Although most research on women's fear of crime has been done in English-speaking countries, with the most done in the United States, similar trends in women's fear of crime have been found around the world.&lt;ref name=":11"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Karakus|first=Onder|last2=McGarrell|first2=Edmund F.|last3=Basibuyuk|first3=Oguzhan|date=2010|title=Fear of crime among citizens of Turkey|url=http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0047235210000267|journal=Journal of Criminal Justice|volume=38|issue=2|pages=174–184|doi=10.1016/j.jcrimjus.2010.02.006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Africa ===
A 2014 study using data from 20 countries in Sub-Saharan Africa concluded that fear of crime has a stronger negative effect on women's subjective well-being compared to men's, with subjective wellbeing defined as self-reported satisfaction with life. In the study, fear of crime had a statistically significant correlation with subjective wellbeing for females, but no significant correlation for males, suggesting that for the men in the study, fear of crime was not an important factor in determining their happiness and life satisfaction.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Sulemana|first=Iddisah|date=2014|title=The Effect of Fear of Crime and Crime Victimization on Subjective Well-Being in Africa|url=https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11205-014-0660-4|journal=Social Indicators Research|language=en|volume=121|issue=3|pages=849–872|doi=10.1007/s11205-014-0660-4|issn=0303-8300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Asia ===
A 2013 study of Hong Kong social work students found significant gender differences in fear of crime levels. Consistent with the shadow of sexual assault hypothesis, the study found that the women had the highest levels of fear for rape, and that fear of rape was a predictor for fear of other crimes. Hong Kong has one of the lowest rates of crime and victimization in the world, so this study may suggest that the presence and size of gender differences in fear of crime are not strongly correlated with total crime and victimization rates.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt;

=== Europe ===
A 1998 study in Glasgow, Scotland, found a gender disparity in fear of crime levels smaller than what is generally accepted. The study also found that men and women with similar fear levels tended to use similar reasoning to explain their fear of crime or lack of fear, although men's and women's fear appeared in different situations (men tended to be more often fearful about property crime, whereas women were more fearful about violent crime).&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;

=== Middle East ===
A 2010 Turkish study using a large nationwide sample confirmed that women expressed significantly higher levels of fear of crime than men. The study also found that previous victimization, a consistent predictor for higher levels of fear in women, was present at close to equal rates in the male and female samples, suggesting that prior victimization has a stronger effect on women's fear of crime than on men's. Also, if the study's sample is representative of the Turkish population, women have slightly higher victimization rates than men, and so their fear does not reflect the "gender-fear paradox" of victimization found in many other developed countries.&lt;ref name=":11" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="6435">'''Zebra''' is the American [[medical slang]] for arriving at an exotic [[medical diagnosis]] when a more commonplace explanation is more likely.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos|Sotos (2006) page 1.]]&lt;/ref&gt;  It is shorthand for the [[aphorism]] coined in the late 1940s by Dr. [[Theodore Woodward]], professor at the [[University of Maryland, Baltimore|University of Maryland]] School of Medicine, who instructed his [[internship (medicine)|medical interns]]: "When you hear hoofbeats, think of horses not zebras".&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos|Sotos (2006) page 1.]]&lt;/ref&gt; Since horses are common in Maryland while zebras are relatively rare, logically one could confidently guess that an animal making hoofbeats is probably a horse. By 1960, the aphorism was widely known in medical circles.&lt;ref&gt;[[#Imperato|Imperato (1979) pages 13, 18.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

As explained by Sotos,&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos|Sotos (2006) page 7.]]&lt;/ref&gt; medical novices are predisposed to make rare diagnoses because of (a) the [[availability heuristic]] ("events more easily remembered are judged more probable") and (b) the phenomenon first enunciated in ''[[Rhetorica ad Herennium]]'' (circa 85 BC), "the striking and the novel stay longer in the mind."  Thus, the aphorism is an important caution against these biases when teaching medical students to weigh medical evidence.

Diagnosticians have noted, however, that "zebra"-type diagnoses must nonetheless be held in mind until the evidence conclusively rules them out:
{{quote|In making the diagnosis of the cause of illness in an individual case, calculations of probability have no meaning.  The pertinent question is whether the disease is present or not.  Whether it is rare or common does not change the odds in a single patient. ... If the diagnosis can be made on the basis of specific criteria, then these criteria are either fulfilled or not fulfilled. — A. McGehee Harvey, James Bordley II, Jeremiah Barondess&lt;ref&gt;[[#Harvey|Harvey (1979) page 15.]]&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The term for an obscure and rare diagnosis in medicine is [[wiktionary:fascinoma|fascinoma]].

==Examples==
[[Necrotic]] skin lesions in the United States are often diagnosed as [[loxoscelism]] ([[recluse spider]] bites), even in areas where ''Loxosceles'' species are rare or not present.  This is a matter of concern because such misdiagnoses can delay correct diagnosis and treatment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Spiders of the genus ''Loxosceles'' (Araneae, Sicariidae): a review of biological, medical and psychological aspects regarding envenomations|first=Richard S. |last=Vetter |year=2008 |work=[[Journal of Arachnology]] |volume=36 |pages=150–163 |url=http://www.americanarachnology.org/JoA_free/JoA_v36_n1/arac-36-1-150.pdf |format=PDF |doi=10.1636/rst08-06.1}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Counter usage==
[[Ehlers–Danlos syndrome]] and [[hypermobility syndrome]] are both medical zebras and yet are commonly under diagnosed and misdiagnosed. The EDS and hypermobility syndrome awareness movements have adopted the zebra as the mascot for their campaigning.&lt;ref&gt;Why the Zebra|url=http://www.ehlers-danlos.org/about-eds-uk/why-the-zebra&lt;/ref&gt;

==In popular culture==
The television series ''[[Scrubs (TV series)|Scrubs]]'' episode "[[My Balancing Act]]", focuses on this theme, and the medical veteran [[Perry Cox|Dr. Cox]] uses the metaphor to explain to [[Internship (medicine)|intern]] [[J.D. (Scrubs)|John "J. D." Dorian]] why he should first consider a simple diagnosis.

The television series ''[[House (TV series)|House]]'' had the working title ''Chasing Zebras, Circling the Drain'',&lt;ref name="House-Holmes"&gt;{{cite news|title=House... and Holmes|date=January 2006|work=[[Radio Times]]|publisher=BBC Magazines Ltd.|page=57|url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/house/house-and-holmes-parallels/|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5msfesWep?url=http://www.radiotimes.com/content/show-features/house/house-and-holmes-parallels/|archivedate=January 18, 2010|deadurl=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; a reference to the show's recurring theme of hunting for obscure diagnoses while a patient is in a critical condition. The title character, diagnostic expert [[Dr. Gregory House]] rejects the aphorism, arguing that any cases with simple solutions would have been successfully diagnosed by someone else before reaching him. 

The episode [[Zebras (Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit)|"Zebras"]] of the television series ''[[Law &amp; Order: Special Victims Unit]]'' was named after this term and cites a version of the aphorism in the teaser.

[[Harvard Medical School]] and [[Harvard School of Dental Medicine]]'s 2017 music video "IT'S NOT A ZEBRA!" depicts a group of first-year medical students erroneously trying to diagnose a patient with a rare and unlikely disease, when in fact she has the flu.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.huffingtonpost.com/entry/10-best-moments-from-the-2017-harvard-medical-school_us_59013778e4b00acb75f1849b|title=10 Best Moments from the Class of 2020 Harvard Medical School/Harvard School of Dental Medicine Music Video|last=Price|first=Mirissa D.|date=2017-04-27|website=Huffington Post|language=en-US|access-date=2018-11-28}}&lt;/ref&gt;  

==Other medical aphorisms==
* [[Sutton's law]] – perform first the diagnostic test expected to be most useful
* [[Occam's razor]] – select from among competing hypotheses the one that makes the fewest new assumptions
* Leonard's Law of Physical Findings – it's obvious or it's not there&lt;ref&gt;[[#Sotos|Sotos (2006) page 15.]]&lt;/ref&gt;

A '''Zero Waste Event''' (or "ZeeWee" as it has been nicknamed) is one in which event organizers plan ahead to reduce solid waste from the event, reuse various elements such as banners, and set up Zero-Waste Stations for those recyclable and compostable materials such as [[paper cup]]s, food scraps, and plastic [[water bottle]]s that are generated by the event.  ZeeWees can range from large scale sports events to weddings and parties.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sconnect.org/bizdev/conference/ |title=Future of Business Conference- Sustainable Strategies for 2013 — Sustainable Connections |publisher=Sconnect.org |date=2013-04-26 |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sconnect.org/bizdev/tzw/TZW08_insert_v4.pdf/ |format=PDF |title=Think Local - Buy Local : Be waste Free |publisher=Sconnect.org|accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sustainabletransforum.ca/presentations.html] {{dead link|date=May 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=|url=http://theredbarncooperative.wordpress.com/2008/06/15/jill-donello-zero-in-on-zero-waste/ |title=Jill Donello – Zero In on Zero Waste &amp;#124; |publisher=Theredbarncooperative.wordpress.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
As sustainability becomes ever more accepted as a concept within organizations and communities across the nation, the idea of [[Zero waste|Zero Waste]] Events is spreading.  Additionally, the steady expansion of recycling and commercial composting infrastructure makes it possible to offer recycling and food composting at events in many locations. Increasingly [https://web.archive.org/web/20120322144442/http://zerowasteevents.org/protocol/ Zero Waste Events] are sharing best practices and developing new ways to divert event materials from landfills.

==Strategy==
ZeeWee's utilize many if not all of the following strategies.

'''Front-end waste prevention'''
* Eliminating race packets in favor of emailed sponsor coupons for participants;
* Eliminating commercial [[bottled water]] distribution in favor of bulk water stations and compostable cups;
* Purchasing recycled content products, from event [[t-shirt]]s to paper products; and
* Providing discounted entries or incentives for participants who travel to the event using alternative transportation. &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.skitosea.com/content/green_team/green_team.asp ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081009153628/http://www.skitosea.com/content/green_team/green_team.asp |date=October 9, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Reuse of event equipment'''
* Reusable, weatherproof banners and stands;
* Adaptable date panels on banners and signs so they can be reused year after year; and
* Use of durable dishware "lending libraries"&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.re-sources.org/wastereduction.htm ] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080925211512/http://www.re-sources.org/wastereduction.htm |date=September 25, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of always buying disposables.

'''Recycling event materials'''
* Many items from unsoiled paper, cardboard, glass, [[plastic bottle]]s and jugs, aluminum cans and plastic tarps to corrugated polypropylene signs can be recycled depending on the services available in a given municipality or county.  In many cases, such services are less costly than disposal of the same items;
* Having a dedicated Recycling Team onsite throughout the event to supervise recycling stations and sort materials to maximize landfill diversion and minimize contamination;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Alison Dunn |url=http://runningmagazine.ca/sections/news/vancouver-half-recycles-95-of-waste/ |title=Vancouver half-marathon produces only four bags of garbage - Canadian Running Magazine |publisher=Runningmagazine.ca |date=2013-06-26 |accessdate=2015-05-15 |deadurl=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; and
* Where programs require subsidy, ZeeWee organizers may use a "green fee" to help move the event toward sustainability by paying for [[Waste minimisation|waste reduction]], buying recycled products, or more recently purchasing carbon offsets.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.norkarecreation.com/hcrewards.htm |title=Bellingham/Whatcom County Washington |publisher=NorKarecreation.com |date=2013-09-08 |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2012 Olympics==
When the bid was submitted for the [[2012 Summer Olympics|London 2012 Olympic]] and [[2012 Summer Paralympics|Paralympic Games]], [[LOCOG]], The London 2012 Organising Committee of the Olympic and Paralympic Games, pledged not just to host the biggest sporting event in the world but also to stage the first truly sustainable Games.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/science-environment-13160540 |title=London 2012 Olympics team publishes first green report - BBC News |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date= |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Central to this was an ambitious target to send zero waste from Games-time venues directly to landfill &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.london2012.com/documents/locog-publications/london-2012-sustainability-plan.pdf |title=Official Reports, Studies, Publications &amp;#124; Downloads &amp;#124; Olympic.org |publisher=London2012.com |date= |accessdate=2015-05-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; – something that no Games has attempted before. 
In February 2012 an initiative was launched to share the lessons learnt from delivering a zero waste games with the wider waste and events community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://zerowasteevents.org/front/]  {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130327035411/http://zerowasteevents.org/front/ |date=March 27, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="12517">{{For|the album|Zoo Hypothesis (album)}}
The '''zoo hypothesis''' speculates as to the assumed behavior and existence of technically advanced [[extraterrestrial life]] and the reasons they refrain from contacting Earth and is one of many theoretical explanations for the [[Fermi paradox]]. The hypothesis is that alien life intentionally avoids communication with Earth, and one of its main interpretations is that it does so to allow for natural [[evolution]] and [[Sociocultural evolution|sociocultural development]], avoiding [[interplanetary contamination]], similarly to people observing animals at a zoo. The hypothesis seeks to explain the apparent absence of extraterrestrial life despite its generally accepted plausibility and hence the reasonable expectation of its existence.&lt;ref name=ball&gt;{{cite journal |last=Ball |first=John A. |title=The Zoo Hypothesis |journal=[[International Journal of Solar System Studies|Icarus]] |volume=19 |issue=3 |pages=347–349 |date=Jul 1973 |doi=10.1016/0019-1035(73)90111-5 |bibcode=1973Icar...19..347B}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Aliens might, for example, choose to allow contact once the human species has passed certain technological, political, or ethical standards. They might withhold contact until humans force contact upon them, possibly by sending a [[spacecraft]] to planets they inhabit. Alternatively, a reluctance to initiate contact could reflect a sensible desire to minimize risk. An alien society with advanced remote-sensing technologies may conclude that direct contact with neighbors confers added risks to oneself without an added benefit. 

==Assumptions==
The zoo hypothesis assumes first that a large number of alien cultures exist,{{citation needed|date=September 2018}} and second that these aliens have great reverence for independent, natural evolution and development. In particular, assuming that intelligence is a physical process that acts to maximize the diversity of a system's accessible futures,&lt;ref&gt;[[Alex Wissner-Gross|A. D. Wissner-Gross]], "[http://www.alexwg.org/link?url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.alexwg.org%2Fpublications%2FPhysRevLett_110-168702.pdf Causal entropic forces]", ''Physical Review Letters'' 110, 168702 (2013).&lt;/ref&gt; a fundamental motivation for the zoo hypothesis would be that premature contact would "unintelligently" reduce the overall diversity of paths the universe itself could take. 

These ideas are perhaps most plausible if there is a relatively universal cultural or legal policy among a plurality of extraterrestrial civilizations necessitating isolation with respect to civilizations at Earth-like stages of development. In a universe without a hegemonic power, random single civilizations with independent principles would make contact. This makes a crowded Universe with clearly defined rules seem more plausible.&lt;ref&gt;Soter, S. (2005). Astrobiol. Mag. 17 Oct [http://www.astrobio.net/news/modules.php?op=modload&amp;name=News&amp;file=article&amp;sid=1745 "SETI and the Cosmic Quarantine Hypothesis"]&lt;/ref&gt;

If there is a plurality of alien cultures, however, this theory may break down under the uniformity of motive concept because it would take just a single extraterrestrial civilization to decide to act contrary to the imperative within our range of detection for it to be undone, and the probability of such a violation increases with the number of civilizations.&lt;ref&gt;Crawford, I.A., "Where are They? Maybe we are alone in the galaxy after all", Scientific American, July 2000, 38–43, (2000).[http://www.scientificamerican.com/article.cfm?id=where-are-they]&lt;/ref&gt; This idea, however, becomes more plausible if all civilizations tend to evolve similar cultural standards and values with regard to contact much like [[convergent evolution]] on Earth has independently evolved eyes on numerous occasions,&lt;ref&gt;Kozmik, Z.; Ruzickova, J.; Jonasova, K.; Matsumoto, Y.; Vopalensky, P.; Kozmikova, I.; Strnad, H.; Kawamura, S. et al. (Jul 2008). "Assembly of the cnidarian camera-type eye from vertebrate-like components". ''Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences of the United States of America'' 105 (26): 8989–8993.[http://www.pnas.org/content/105/26/8989.full]&lt;/ref&gt; or all civilizations follow the lead of some particularly distinguished civilization, such as the [[first civilization]] among them.&lt;ref&gt;Bracewell, R. (1982). Pre-emption of the Galaxy by the First AdvancedCivilization, Pergmon Press, Oxford.[http://adsabs.harvard.edu/abs/1982ewat.book...34B]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Fermi paradox==
{{Main|Fermi paradox}}
With this in mind, a modified zoo hypothesis becomes a more appealing answer to the Fermi paradox. The time between the emergence of the [[first civilization]] within the [[Milky Way]] and all subsequent civilizations could be enormous. [[Monte Carlo simulation]] shows the first few inter-arrival times between emergent civilizations would be similar in length to [[Epoch (geology)|geologic epochs]] on Earth. Just what could a civilization do with a ten-million, one-hundred-million, or half-billion-year head start?&lt;ref&gt;[[Kardashev scale]] Kardashev, N.S. (1964). ''Soviet Astronomy''. 8, 217&lt;/ref&gt;

Even if this first grand civilization is long gone, their initial legacy could live on in the form of a passed-down tradition, or perhaps an artificial life form dedicated to such a goal without the risk of death. Beyond this, it does not even have to be the first civilization, but simply the first to spread its doctrine and control over a large volume of the galaxy. If just one civilization gained this hegemony in the distant past, it could form an unbroken chain of taboo against rapacious colonization in favour of non-interference in those civilizations that follow. The uniformity of motive concept previously mentioned would become moot in such a situation.

If the oldest civilization still present in the Milky Way has, for example, a 100-million-year time advantage over the next oldest civilization, then it is conceivable that they could be in the singular position of being able to control, monitor, influence or isolate the emergence of every civilization that follows within their sphere of influence. This is analogous to what happens on Earth within our own civilization on a daily basis, in that everyone born on this planet is born into a pre-existing system of familial associations, customs, traditions and laws that were already long established before our birth and which we have little or no control over.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Hair | first1 = T.

==Appearance in fiction==
*In [[Olaf Stapledon|Olaf Stapledon's]] 1937 novel ''[[Star Maker]]'', great care is taken by the Symbiont race to keep its existence hidden from "pre-utopian" primitives, "lest they should lose their independence of mind". It is only when such worlds become utopian-level space travellers that the Symbionts make contact and bring the young utopia to an equal footing.
*[[Arthur C. Clarke]]'s ''[[The Sentinel (short story)|The Sentinel]]'' (first published in 1951) and its later novel adaptation ''[[2001: A Space Odyssey (novel)|2001: A Space Odyssey]]'' (1968) feature a beacon which is activated when the human race discovers it on the moon. An alien race has apparently visited us in the distant past.
*In ''[[Childhood's End]]'', a novel by [[Arthur C. Clarke]] published in 1953, the alien cultures had been observing and registering the [[Earth]]'s evolution and human history for thousands (perhaps millions) of years. At the beginning of the book, when mankind is about to achieve [[spaceflight]], the aliens reveal their existence and quickly end the [[Nuclear arms race|arms race]], [[colonialism]], [[racial segregation]] and the [[Cold War]].
*In ''[[Star Trek]]'', the [[United Federation of Planets|Federation]] (including humans) has a strict [[Prime Directive]] policy of nonintervention with less technologically advanced cultures which the Federation encounters. The threshold of inclusion is the independent technological development of [[faster-than-light]] propulsion. In the show's canon the [[Vulcans (Star Trek)|Vulcan]] race limited their encounters to observation until Humans made their first [[warp drive (Star Trek)|warp]] flight, after which they initiated [[Star Trek: First Contact|first contact]], indicating the practice predated the Human race's advance of this threshold. Additionally, in the episode "[[The Chase (Star Trek: The Next Generation)|The Chase (TNG)]]", a message from a first (or early) civilization is discovered, hidden in the [[DNA]] of [[Sentience|sentient]] species spread across many worlds, something that could only have been fully discovered after a race had become sufficiently advanced.
* In [[Julian May]]'s 1987 novel ''[[Galactic Milieu Series#Intervention|Intervention]]'', the five alien races of the Galactic Milieu keep the Earth under surveillance, but do not intervene until humans demonstrate mental and ethical maturity through a paranormal prayer of peace.
* [[Bill Watterson]]'s ''[[Calvin and Hobbes]]'' comic strip for November 8, 1989, alludes to the possibility of an ethical threshold for first contact (or at least for the prudence of first contact) in Calvin's remark "Sometimes I think the surest sign that intelligent life exists elsewhere in the universe is that none of it has tried to contact us."
*In [[Robert J. Sawyer]]'s SF novel ''[[Calculating God]]'' (2000), Hollus, a scientist from an advanced alien civilization, denies that her government is operating under the prime directive.
*In ''[[Hard to Be a God]]'' by [[Arkady and Boris Strugatsky]], the (unnamed) medieval-esque planet where the novel takes action is protected by the advanced civilization of Earth, and the observers from Earth present on the planet are forbidden to intervene and make overt contact. One of the major themes of the novel is the ethical dilemma presented by such a stance to the observers.
*In ''[[Speaker for the Dead]]'' by [[Orson Scott Card]], the human xenobiologists and xenologers, biologists and anthropologists observing alien life, are forbidden from giving the native species, the Pequeninos, any technology or information. When one of the xenobiologists is killed in an alien ceremony, they are forbidden to mention it. This happens again until Ender Wiggin, the main character of ''[[Ender's Game]]'', explains to the Pequeninos that humans cannot partake in the ceremony because it kills them. While this is not exactly an example of the zoo hypothesis, since humanity makes contact, it is very similar and the humans seek to keep the Pequeninos ignorant of technology.
*In ''[[South Park]]'''s inaugural episode of season seven, "[[Cancelled (South Park)|Cancelled]]", aliens refrain from contacting Earth because the planet is the subject and setting of a reality television show. Unlike most variations of the zoo hypothesis where contact is not initiated in order to allow organic socioeconomic, cultural, and technological development, the aliens in this episode refrain from contact for the sole purpose of entertainment. In essence, the aliens treat all of Earth like the titular character in ''[[The Truman Show]]'' in order to maintain the show's integrity.
*In the 2008 video game ''[[Spore (2008 game)|Spore]]'', which [[simulation video game|simulates]] the evolution and life of species on a fictional galaxy, intelligent species in the "Space Stage" cannot contact those in previous stages, which did not [[world unification|unify]] their planets, nor develop [[spaceflight]] yet. However, they are allowed to [[alien abduction|abduct]] their citizens/members, to create [[crop circle]]s in their terrain and to place in their planets a tool called "[[Monolith (Space Odyssey)|monolith]]", which accelerates their technological evolution.
*[[Iain M. Banks]]' ''[[The State of the Art]]'' depicts [[the Culture]] secretly visiting Earth and then deciding to leave it uncontacted, watching its development as a [[control group]], to confirm whether their manipulations of other civilizations are ultimately for the best.
