      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2320">'''Abraham Maskileison''' (1788&amp;ndash;1848) was a [[Jewish people|Jewish]] scholar, [[rabbi]] and author active in [[Russia]] during the first half of the 19th century.

Rabbi Maskileison was a descendant of another [[Talmud]]ic scholar, Israel Jaffe of [[Shklov]], author of "Or Yisrael". Maskileison discharged his rabbinical duties in many cities and, in his later years, went to [[Minsk]], where he remained until his death at the age of about 60. Having no desire to use his [[Kabbalah|cabalistic]] knowledge for gain, as was done by the miracle-working rabbis, he devoted his whole life to study of the [[Torah]] and the Talmud. He lived in comparative poverty, being satisfied with only a small income.

==Works==
Abraham Maskileison wrote the following works:
*''Maskil le-Eisan'' (1818). Shklov. Novellæ on parts of [[Moed]] and [[Kodoshim]], printed with the approbations of [[Katzenellenbogen|Saul Katzenellenbogen]] of [[Vilno]] and Manasseh Iliyer.
*''Be'er Avraham'' (1848). Vilno. Novellæ on the remaining parts of the Talmud.

Abraham Maskileison's posthumously published works were:
*''Nachal Eisan'' (1859). Vilno. Novellæ on the first two parts of [[Maimonides]]' ''Yad ha-Ḥazaḳah''
*''Mitzpeh Eisan'' (1858–64). [[Zhitomir]]; (1880–86). Vilno. ''Notes on the Talmud'' (published in the back of the [[Vilna Edition Shas]])
*''Yad Abraham'' (1888). Vilno. Novellæ on ''[[Yoreh De'ah]]''; notes on [[Sifre]]
*''Ahavas Eisan'', novallae on ''[[Ein Yaakov]]''

Maskileison's son rearranged and republished with his own footnotes ''Seder HaDoros'' written by Rabbi [[Jehiel Heilprin|Yechiel Michel Heilprin]] (1660–1746).

[[File:Messager André compositeur 1921.jpg|thumb|alt=head and shoulder shot of an elderly bald man with a large moustache|André Messager, 1921]]
'''André Charles Prosper Messager''' ({{IPA-fr|mɛsaʒe|lang}}; 30 December 1853&amp;nbsp;– 24 February 1929) was a French composer, organist, pianist and conductor. His compositions include eight ballets and thirty [[opéra comique|opéras comiques]], [[opérette]]s and other stage works, among which his ballet ''[[Les Deux Pigeons (ballet)|Les Deux Pigeons]]'' (1886) and opéra comique ''[[Véronique (operetta)|Véronique]]'' (1898) have had lasting success; ''[[Les p'tites Michu|Les P'tites Michu]]'' (1897) and ''[[Monsieur Beaucaire (opera)|Monsieur Beaucaire]]'' (1919) were also popular internationally.

Messager took up the piano as a small child and later studied composition with, among others, [[Camille Saint-Saëns]] and [[Gabriel Fauré]]. He became a major figure in the musical life of Paris and later London, both as a conductor and a composer. Many of his Parisian works were also produced in the [[West End theatre|West End]] and some on [[Broadway theatre|Broadway]]; the most successful had long runs and numerous international revivals. He wrote two operatic works in English, and his later output included [[Musical theatre#Early 20th century|musical comedies]] for [[Sacha Guitry]] and [[Yvonne Printemps]].

As a conductor, Messager held prominent positions in Paris and London, at the head of the [[Opéra-Comique]], the [[Paris Opera|Paris Opéra]], the [[Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire]], and the [[Royal Opera House]], Covent Garden. Although as a composer he is known chiefly for his light works, as a conductor he presented a wide range of operas, from [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]] to [[Richard Strauss]], and he acquired a reputation as a conductor of [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]. In Paris he conducted the world premieres of [[Claude Debussy|Debussy]]'s ''[[Pelléas et Mélisande (opera)|Pelléas et Mélisande]]'', [[Jules Massenet|Massenet's]] ''[[Grisélidis]]'' and [[Gustave Charpentier|Charpentier]]'s ''[[Louise (opera)|Louise]]''.  At Covent Garden, he gave the British premieres of operas by Saint-Saëns and Massenet.

Messager's music became known for its melodic and orchestral invention, musical craftsmanship, and characteristically French elegance and grace. Although most of his works have been infrequently revived, historians of music consider him the last major figure in French opéra comique and opérette.

==Life and career==

===Early years===
[[File:Messager's-mentors.jpg|left|alt=four head and shoulder photos of middle-aged nineteenth-century men in semi-profile. All are wearing suits and have facial hair.|thumb|upright|Four of Messager's musical influences: clockwise from top left, [[Camille Saint-Saëns|Saint-Saëns]]; [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]]; [[Eugène Gigout|Gigout]]; [[Emmanuel Chabrier|Chabrier]]]]
Messager was born at [[Montluçon]] in central France on 30 December 1853, the son of Paul-Philippe-Émile Messager, a prosperous local tax collector, and his wife Sophie-Cornélie, ''née'' Lhôte de Selancy.&lt;ref&gt;Augé-Laribé, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; He recalled, "You would not find any musicians among my ancestors. When very young I learned the piano; but later on my intentions to become a composer met with such opposition from my father".&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Wagstaff, pp. 157 and 161&lt;/ref&gt; At the age of seven he was sent as a boarder to a [[Marist Brothers|Marist]] school where he continued his interest in the piano.&lt;ref name=grove&gt;Wagstaff, John and [[Andrew Lamb (writer)|Andrew Lamb]]. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/18492 "Messager, André"], ''Grove Music Online'', Oxford Music Online, accessed 15 March 2018 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Towards the end of the 1860s disastrous stock-market speculation brought Messager's family financial ruin and they could no longer afford to keep him at the Marist school.&lt;ref&gt;Wagstaff, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt; They dropped their objection to music as a profession, viewing a post as a church organist as a respectable and steady career. He was awarded a bursary to study at the [[École Niedermeyer de Paris|École Niedermeyer]] in Paris, an academy known for its focus on church music.&lt;ref&gt;Ferchault, Guy, and Jacqueline Gachet.

Fauré and Messager quickly moved from being master and pupil to being firm friends and occasional collaborators.&lt;ref name=jones&gt;Jones, pp. 51–63&lt;/ref&gt; In 1874 Messager succeeded Fauré as ''organiste du chœur'' (choir organist) at [[Église Saint-Sulpice, Paris|Saint-Sulpice]], Paris, under the principal organist, [[Charles-Marie Widor]].&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, p. 19&lt;/ref&gt; In 1876 he won the gold medal of the Société des Auteurs, Compositeurs et Editeurs de Musique with a symphony, the work being warmly received when performed by the [[Concerts Colonne]] at the [[Théâtre du Châtelet]] in January 1878.{{refn|Following its good reception the symphony was given several repeat performances soon afterwards.&lt;ref&gt;Wagstaff, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} He won further prizes for his [[cantata]]s ''Don Juan et Haydée'' and ''Prométhée enchaîné''.&lt;ref name=fournier/&gt;

In 1879 Fauré and Messager travelled to [[Cologne Opera|Cologne]] to see [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Das Rheingold]]'' and ''[[Die Walküre]]'', and later to [[Bavarian State Opera|Munich]] for the complete ''[[Der Ring des Nibelungen|Ring]]'' cycle, ''[[Die Meistersinger von Nürnberg]]'' and ''[[Tannhäuser (opera)|Tannhäuser]]''; in 1888 they went to [[Bayreuth Festival|Bayreuth]] for ''Die Meistersinger'' and ''[[Parsifal]]''.&lt;ref name=jones/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, p. 39&lt;/ref&gt; They frequently performed as a party piece their joint composition, the irreverent ''Souvenirs de Bayreuth'' (c. 1888).{{refn|The date is Nectoux's estimate.&lt;ref name=n541&gt;Nectoux, p. 541&lt;/ref&gt; Wagstaff and Lamb in ''[[Grove Dictionary of Music and Musicians|Grove]]'' put the date earlier, possibly 1880.&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; The work was not published during either composer's lifetime. It was first published in 1930 by Costallat et Cie, Paris ({{OCLC|317674216}}).&lt;ref name=n541/&gt;|group= n}} This short, skittish piano work for four hands burlesques motifs from ''The Ring''.&lt;ref&gt;Blanche, Jacques-Emile in ''[[La Revue musicale]]'', December 1938, pp. 186–187, quoted in Nichols p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; The two composers had a more serious collaboration, their ''[[Messe des pêcheurs de Villerville]]'' (1881).&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, pp. 114–115&lt;/ref&gt;

===First successes===

In 1878 Messager was appointed conductor at the [[Folies Bergère]], and he began his career composing for the stage with two short ballets, ''Fleur d'oranger'' (1878) and ''Les Vins de France'' (1879).&lt;ref&gt;Duteurtre, p. 116&lt;/ref&gt; In 1880 a former manager of the Folies, M. Comy, was appointed to run the new Eden Théâtre in Brussels. At his invitation, Messager resigned from the Folies in 1880 and became conductor of the Eden.&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in Brussels", ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'', 20 June 1880, p. 12; and Wagstaff, John, and Andrew Lamb. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/18492 "Messager, André"]. ''Grove Music Online'', Oxford Music Online, accessed 15 March 2018 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; He returned to Paris in 1881 as organist of [[Saint-Paul-Saint-Louis]] church, and from 1882 to 1884 he was organist and choirmaster at Ste Marie-des-[[Batignolles]], a small church in the north west of Paris, where his assistant was another young composer, [[Claude Terrasse]].&lt;ref name=fournier/&gt;&lt;ref name=baker/&gt;

Messager's career took a new turn in 1883 when the composer [[Firmin Bernicat]] died leaving an unfinished [[opérette]], ''[[François les bas-bleus]]''. Messager was invited to complete it; he orchestrated the entire work and composed between twelve and fifteen numbers.&lt;ref&gt;Wagstaff, p. 45&lt;/ref&gt; It was staged in November 1883 at the [[Théâtre des Folies-Dramatiques]] and was an immediate critical and popular success.&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in Paris", ''The Era'', 17 November 1883.&lt;/ref&gt; It was later produced in London and New York.&lt;ref name=ftr/&gt;&lt;ref name=fus/&gt; In 1883, while deputising for Saint-Saëns as the soloist at a concert in [[Le Havre]], Messager met a young woman, Edith Clouette, whom he married in the same year.&lt;ref name=fournier/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Augé-Laribé, p. 50&lt;/ref&gt; Fauré played the organ at the ceremony,{{refn|As bride and bridegroom processed solemnly down the aisle Fauré mischievously included in his improvisation a tune from one of Messager's Folies Bergère ballets.&lt;ref name=harding124&gt;Harding, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} and composed a mildly cynical song, "[[Madrigal (Fauré)|Madrigal]]", as a wedding present.&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, p. 108&lt;/ref&gt; There was one child of the marriage, Jean André Emile Charles (1886–1952).&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.artlyriquefr.fr/personnages/Messager%20Andre.html "André Messager"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180407135915/https://www.artlyriquefr.fr/personnages/Messager%20Andre.html |date=7 April 2018}}, Association l'Art Lyrique Français, accessed 7 April 2018&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 1883 Messager and [[Emmanuel Chabrier]] gave the first performance of the latter's ''[[Trois valses romantiques]]'' at the [[Société Nationale de Musique]]. The concert also included the premiere of the two-piano version of ''[[España (Chabrier)|España]]'', arranged by Messager.&lt;ref&gt;Myers, p. 47; and Wagstaff, p. 77&lt;/ref&gt; Messager and Chabrier were close friends until the latter's death in 1894. Both were known for their comic operas and opérettes, but Chabrier's one serious opera, ''[[Gwendoline (opera)|Gwendoline]]'', appealed strongly to Messager, who vowed to conduct it in Paris, which he later did.{{refn|Messager's first Paris performance of ''Gwendoline'' was on 12 May 1911.&lt;ref&gt;Delage, p. 625&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} He also prepared a piano reduction of the orchestral parts for the vocal score of the work.{{refn|The score was published in 1890 in Paris by Enoch frères and Costallat; and in Brunswick by [[Henry Litolff]]s Verlag.&lt;ref&gt;[[British Library]] catalogue number 004260835; {{OCLC|497254214}}&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

Following the success of ''François les bas-bleus'' Messager accepted simultaneous invitations to compose a ballet for the Opéra and an opérette for the Folies-Dramatiques. The opérette, ''[[La fauvette du temple|La Fauvette du temple]]'', first performed on 17 November 1885, confirmed Messager's early reputation. It ran well into the following year in Paris, and he was able to sell the British rights immediately, though the work was not staged in London until 1891.&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in Paris", ''The Era'', 13 February 1886; "The Theatres", ''The Daily News'', 30 November 1885, p. 2; and "Occasional Notes", ''[[Pall Mall Gazette]]'', 17 November 1891, p. 2&lt;/ref&gt; The ballet, ''[[Les Deux Pigeons (ballet)|Les Deux Pigeons]]'', which became one of Messager's best known works, took longer to reach the stage. It was put into rehearsal at the Opéra, but the staging, which showed a tree being struck by lightning in a storm scene, was considered a fire hazard by the police, and the production was temporarily shelved.&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in Paris", ''The Era'', 25 October 1884, p. 15&lt;/ref&gt;

A month after the opening of ''La Fauvette du temple'' the Bouffes-Parisiens premiered Messager's opéra comique ''[[La Béarnaise]]'', with [[Jeanne Granier]] in the title role. It ran for three months and was successfully produced in Britain the following year with a cast including [[Florence St. John]] and [[Marie Tempest]], running for more than 200 performances.&lt;ref&gt;"La Bearnaise", ''The Era'', 2 October 1886, p. 9; "The London Theatres", ''The Era'', 9 October 1886, p. 14; and "The Drama in America", ''The Era'', 2 July 1887, p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Times]]'' said of this production that it gave Messager a secure footing in London, which led to important results later in his career.&lt;ref name=times&gt;Obituary, "M. André Messager", ''The Times'', 25 February 1929, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; A production of ''La Béarnaise'' in New York followed in 1887, under the title ''Jacquette''.&lt;ref name=traubner223/&gt;

In 1886 ''Les Deux Pigeons'' was finally produced at the Paris Opéra and was a box office triumph. It was Messager's last popular success for four years. His attempt at a more serious opera, ''[[Le bourgeois de Calais|Le Bourgeois de Calais]]'' (1888), was not well received. [[Richard Traubner]] remarks in ''Operetta: A Theatrical History'' on its "boring historical plot, bad lyrics, and a banal score";&lt;ref name=traubner223/&gt; a contemporary critic wrote, "That ''Le Bourgeois de Calais'' will have a successful career there is not the faintest chance, for all the patriotic bolstering in the world could not make it an attractive piece."&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in Paris", ''The Era'', 16 April 1887, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt; Messager followed this with a musical fairy tale, ''[[Isoline (opera)|Isoline]]'' (1888), which was slightly better received, and a three-act opérette, ''[[Le mari de la reine|Le Mari de la reine]]'' (1889), which failed, although Messager thought it "the best of my flops".&lt;ref name=fournier/&gt;&lt;ref name=traubner223&gt;Traubner, p. 223&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fin de siècle===
[[File:La basoche opéra-comique.jpg|alt=Coloured illustration from an 1890 French magazine showing a young woman in a simple dress kneeling before a young nobleman, both in mediaeval costume |left|upright| thumb| Scene from ''[[La Basoche]]'', 1890]]
Messager's fortunes revived in 1890 with ''[[La Basoche]]'', produced with much success at the [[Opéra-Comique]].&lt;ref name=fournier/&gt; The critic who had pronounced so unfavourably on ''Le Bourgeois de Calais'' wrote of the new piece, "an exceptionally pleasing work&amp;nbsp;... a dainty piece which cannot fail to obtain widespread popularity."&lt;ref&gt;"The Drama in Paris", ''The Era'', 7 June 1890, p. 9&lt;/ref&gt;  An English-language version was produced in London in 1891 by [[Richard D'Oyly Carte]]. The theatrical newspaper ''[[The Era (newspaper)|The Era]]'' said, "''The Basoche'' is more than a success; it is a triumph",&lt;ref&gt;"The Basoche", ''The Era'', 7 November 1891, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; but the piece had only a modest London run of three months.{{refn|Both the anonymous critic in ''The Era'' and [[George Bernard Shaw|Bernard Shaw]] in ''The World'' condemned the British public for its failure to support the piece.&lt;ref&gt;"Theatres", ''The Era'', 16 January 1892, p. 10; and ''The World'', 10 February 1892, ''reproduced'' in Shaw II, p. 537&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}  A New York production was given in 1893 but was not a success.&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1893/03/11/106862884.pdf "''The Basoche'' Goes"]. ''[[The New York Times]]'', 11 March 1893, p. 8&lt;/ref&gt;

Messager was a dandy and a philanderer. The musical historian [[D.

Shortly afterwards she became ill; her condition deteriorated, and Messager visited her daily.

In 1892 Messager's career as a conductor began to advance when he was invited to conduct ''Die Walküre'' at [[Marseille]]. As a composer the early 1890s brought him mixed fortunes. ''[[Madame Chrysanthème (opera)|Madame Chrysanthème]]'', staged at the [[Théâtre de la Renaissance]] in 1893, was a setting of [[Pierre Loti]]'s story of a betrayed [[geisha]], a theme that later inspired Puccini's ''[[Madama Butterfly]]''; it was politely rather than enthusiastically received. ''[[Mirette (opera)|Mirette]]'', produced by Carte at the [[Savoy Theatre]] in 1894, was Messager's first opera written expressly for the London stage and was the only original [[Savoy opera]] by a French composer.&lt;ref name=traubner213&gt;Traubner, p. 213&lt;/ref&gt; To assist him in what was for him (at the time) an unfamiliar idiom, Messager enlisted the help of the songwriter Dotie (Alice Maude) Davis (1859–1938), known professionally as [[Hope Temple]].&lt;ref&gt;Coles, Clifton.

From 1897 Messager's career revived. He later recalled that he had received by post an unsolicited libretto:
{{quote|I was attracted by the gaiety of its subject, and putting aside my dark thoughts, I set to work on it with such enthusiasm that the work was completed in three months, and performed in the same year at the Bouffes, with great success.

===Last years===
In the 1920s, Messager kept pace with the change in fashion in musical theatre, consciously absorbing the styles of musical comedy, lightening his orchestration, but maintaining a Gallic flavour, mostly avoiding American dance-rhythm influences.&lt;ref name=fournier/&gt; He collaborated with [[Sacha Guitry]] on the musical comedies ''[[L'amour masqué|L'Amour masqué]]'' (1923) and ''Deburau'' (1926), starring [[Yvonne Printemps]].&lt;ref&gt;Duteurtre, p. 101&lt;/ref&gt; The former was a considerable success in Paris, but in London the official censor, the [[Lord Chamberlain#Theatre censorship|Lord Chamberlain]], declared it "unfit for the English public", and banned [[C. B. Cochran]]'s planned production starring Printemps and Guitry.&lt;ref&gt;"Bars L'Amour Masqué", ''The New York Times'', 22 January 1928, p. 13&lt;/ref&gt; In Messager's late stage works his lighter touch was balanced by echoes of the nineteenth century, with hints of Fauré and, particularly, Chabrier's ''[[L'étoile (opera)|L'Étoile]]''.&lt;ref name=fournier/&gt; Fauré, by 1923 too frail and deaf to go to the theatre, was lent a copy of the score of ''L'Amour masqué'' and wrote to Messager, "Your wit is the same as always – it never grows old – and so are your charm and very personal brand of music that always remains exquisite even amid the broadest clowning".&lt;ref name=harding147/&gt; Fauré died the following year, and Messager dedicated the music of ''Deburau'' to his memory.&lt;ref&gt;Augé-Laribé, p. 233&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1924 [[Sergei Diaghilev]] persuaded Messager to conduct the Paris premieres of [[Georges Auric|Auric]]'s ballet ''Les Fâcheux'' and [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]]'s ''[[Les biches|Les Biches]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Buckle, pp. 115–116&lt;/ref&gt; In 1928 Messager played a key role in establishing important updates to copyright law, though he was on the losing side of the case. He sued the [[BBC]] for breach of copyright for broadcasting his works without his consent. He lost because he had assigned his British performing rights to [[George Edwardes]], whose estate had given the BBC permission for the broadcast. The case established that as the broadcasting rights had not been specifically reserved, the Edwardes estate's rights included them.&lt;ref&gt;"Summary of Cases", ''The Times'', 9 November 1928, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt;

===Honours and awards===
Messager was elected President of the [[Société des Auteurs et Compositeurs Dramatiques]] in 1926, the first composer to hold this office. In the same year he was elected to the [[Académie des Beaux-Arts]]. In 1927 he was appointed Commander of the [[Légion d'honneur]].&lt;ref name=baker/&gt; In his native town of Montluçon, the music academy, opened in 2009, is named in his honour.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.agglo-montlucon.fr/index.php/conservatoire.html "Conservatoire à rayonnement départemental pour la musique et l'art dramatique André Messager"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160601213409/http://www.agglo-montlucon.fr/index.php/conservatoire.html |date=1 June 2016 }}, Montluçon Communauté, accessed 15 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, to mark the 150th anniversary of his birth, Messager was the subject of a large exhibition at the Musée des musiques populaires de Montluçon, recounting his biography and illustrating his works in the various genres. Among the ''comité d'honneur'' of the exhibition were the composer's three grandchildren, and the singers [[Susan Graham]], [[Felicity Lott|Dame Felicity Lott]] and [[Mady Mesplé]], the conductors [[John Eliot Gardiner|Sir John Eliot Gardiner]], [[John Nelson (conductor)|John Nelson]] and [[Michel Plasson]], and the director [[Jérôme Savary]].&lt;ref&gt;Duteurtre, pp. 9–10&lt;/ref&gt;

==Music==

Messager is in the middle row, second from right; his teachers [[Gabriel Fauré|Fauré]] and [[Eugène Gigout|Gigout]] are in the front row, second from left and furthest right, respectively.]]
In his 1991 study of Messager, John Wagstaff writes that the composer's music is notable for its fine orchestration, easy-flowing melody, and skilfully written music, dance-like in character. Unlike his teacher Fauré,&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, p. 256&lt;/ref&gt; Messager enjoyed orchestrating. He said that musical ideas came to him "already clothed in the appropriate instrumental shades",&lt;ref name=h128&gt;Hughes, p. 128&lt;/ref&gt; and after the concentrated effort of composing his scores he found it relaxing to work on "the handling of instruments, the balancing of different sonorities, the grouping of colours and the structuring of effects".&lt;ref name=hu129&gt;Hughes, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; He remarked that composers who had their music orchestrated by assistants presumably did not care if their helpers lacked "that indefinable sixth sense which would indicate the right combination of sonorities to carry out the original intentions of the composer". To Messager, passages often depended for their significance or flavour on the orchestral writing alone.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Gervase Hughes]], in a study of French opérette, comments that Messager's only technical defect was "one all too common to many composers of operetta – too close an adherence to repetitive rhythmic figures and four-bar rigidity", although such was Messager's "innate artistry that criticism on that score would be academic pedantry".&lt;ref name=hu99/&gt; One of the composer's distinguishing characteristics was a liking for [[chromaticism]];&lt;ref name=ha127&gt;Harding, p. 127&lt;/ref&gt; this appealed to a younger generation of composers. His "Eh que ne parliez-vous?", from ''La Basoche'', was quoted note-for-note by [[Francis Poulenc|Poulenc]] in ''[[Les Mamelles de Tirésias]]''.&lt;ref name=ha127/&gt; Although Messager greatly admired Wagner, and was a celebrated conductor of his music, he distanced himself from Wagnerian influences in his own compositions. In ''Madame Chrysanthème'' he made use of [[leitmotif]]s, and included other references to Wagner, but such examples are rare in his works.&lt;ref name=w17&gt;Wagstaff, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt;

Ballets apart, Messager composed thirty works for the stage; they fall into several different, or sometimes overlapping, genres; the most numerous are opéras comiques (9), opérettes (7) and comédies musicales (3).{{refn|There is no universally agreed dividing line between opéra comique and opérette; a 2003 study of opera suggests that the latter is essentially frivolous, and the former, though often (but not always) humorous, also has some element of genuine human interest and is seen as of loftier artistic intent.&lt;ref&gt;Grout and Williams, p. 378&lt;/ref&gt; Others disagree that opérette is "essentially" frivolous.&lt;ref&gt;Traubner, "Introduction", second and third unnumbered pages.&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} The composer remarked late in his career:
{{quote|I have never intended to write what is nowadays called "opérette". This designation – which all too often has pejorative overtones – seems to have become common since the work of [[Charles Lecocq|Lecocq]]. Many of my works&amp;nbsp;... were only called operéttes at the request of theatre directors who saw in that term some extra chance of success. Neither did I wish to compose [[opéra-bouffe]]s, the best examples of which were provided by the works of [[Jacques Offenbach|Offenbach]], where the element of parody is very dominant. My idea was always to continue the tradition of French opéra-comique (with dialogue) as established by [[opéra comique|Dalayrac]], [[François-Adrien Boieldieu|Boieldieu]] and [[Daniel Auber|Auber]].&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in English in Wagstaff, p. 164.

===Early stage works===
[[File:Deux-pigeons-final-tableau-ROH-1906.jpg|alt=photograph of a large ballet troupe posed on a large stage with an elaborate woodland set|thumb|upright=1.75|''Les Deux Pigeons''&amp;nbsp;– final tableau]]
Although Messager called some of his early stage works opéras comiques they have, Gervase Hughes suggests, more in common with opérette than their composer acknowledged. Nevertheless, Messager introduced adventurous modern harmonic details in his early pieces, and strove to raise the artistic standards of opérette to that of opéra comique while retaining the essential panache of the genre.&lt;ref name=h94&gt;Hughes, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes finds the first stage works uneven in quality but ''[[La fauvette du temple|La Fauvette du temple]]'' (1884) to contain two fine expressive duets as well as waltzes and polkas with "an Offenbach lilt".&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 92&lt;/ref&gt; Hughes judges the next two scores, ''[[La Béarnaise]]'' and ''La Fauvette'' (both 1885), less satisfying but nonetheless at least as good as anything by Messager's older contemporaries [[Robert Planquette|Planquette]], [[Gaston Serpette|Serpette]] and [[Charles Lecocq|Lecocq]].&lt;ref name=h93&gt;Hughes, p. 93&lt;/ref&gt;

Wagstaff writes that the composer's most enduring work is the ballet score ''[[Les Deux Pigeons (ballet)|Les Deux Pigeons]]'' (1886).&lt;ref name=wv/&gt; The piece is based on the fable ''[[The Two Pigeons]]'' by [[Jean de La Fontaine]].&lt;ref name=harding124/&gt; The music is best known in the five-movement suite arranged from the full score, which includes the "Entrée de tziganes".&lt;ref name=DeuxROH&gt;[http://www.roh.org.uk/articles/rhapsody-the-two-pigeons-digital-programme-the-two-pigeons-production-photographs "The Two Pigeons"] {{webarchive| url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180317170225/http://www.roh.org.uk/articles/rhapsody-the-two-pigeons-digital-programme-the-two-pigeons-production-photographs |date=17 March 2018}}, Royal Opera House, accessed 17 March 2018&lt;/ref&gt;  Messager revived the ballet in 1906 in London and in 1912 in Paris in a shortened, two-act version.&lt;ref&gt;Pougin, Arthur. Review in ''Le Ménéstrel Musique et Théatres'', 30 March 1912&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 [[John Lanchbery]] revised this for [[Frederick Ashton]]'s new version of the ballet, with a closing reconciliation scene from earlier music and a passage transcribed from ''Véronique''. This was first given at Covent Garden, is revived regularly by the [[Royal Ballet]] and has been staged by such other companies as [[CAPAB]] and [[Australian Ballet]].&lt;ref name=DeuxROH/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Vaughan, pp. 315 and 487&lt;/ref&gt;

''[[Isoline (opera)|Isoline]]'' (1888), a musical fairy story ("conte des fées"), is neither an opérette nor an opéra comique. Writing in 1908, Fauré called it "one of the most poetic, most expressive works that have been written in France in the last twenty years",&lt;ref name=fauré&gt;''Quoted'' in Duteurtre, p. 160&lt;/ref&gt; but it made little impact. The score remained in obscurity until 1930 when [[Reynaldo Hahn]] staged the ballet section of the work at Cannes.&lt;ref name=h125/&gt; The whole piece was revived at the Opéra-Comique in 1958; it failed again, but the ballet, unencumbered by the portentousness of the libretto, which weighs down the rest of the piece, has remained in the repertory.&lt;ref name=h125&gt;Harding, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|In the discography section of his book on Messager, Wagstaff lists 13 recordings of the ballet music.&lt;ref&gt;Wagstaff, p. 133&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}}

===1890s stage works===
[[File:La-Basoche-Pick-Me-Up-1891.jpg|thumb|left|alt=black and white drawing of a stage scene showing a plaza with a man addressing a woman, both in aristocratic mediaeval costume|Scene from ''[[La Basoche]]'']]
The decade began well for Messager with the artistic and commercial success of ''[[La Basoche]]'' (1890). Février in his ''André Messager: Mon Maître, Mon Ami'' calls it "the last of the great nineteenth-century French comic operas" ("le dernier des grands opéras-comique français du XIX siècle")&lt;ref name=f49&gt;Février, p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; and considers it of the greatest importance not only in Messager's career but in the history of French musical theatre.&lt;ref name=f49/&gt; Hughes says it has a good claim to be the composer's masterpiece.&lt;ref name=h93/&gt; The musicologist [[James Harding (music writer)|James Harding]] rates it "the best Messager had written to date&amp;nbsp;... one of his finest works".&lt;ref name=ha127/&gt; When the work was given in London, a year after its Parisian premiere, the reviewer in ''The Times'' called it, "A work of great beauty and charm", although "the influence of ''[[Die Meistersinger]]'' is felt to an extent that is almost absurd both in the bright overture and again in the procession of the guild, but elsewhere the music is as original as it is charming".&lt;ref&gt;"Royal English Opera", ''The Times'', 4 November 1891, p. 6&lt;/ref&gt;

With ''[[Madame Chrysanthème (opera)|Madame Chrysanthème]]'' (1893), a four-act "lyric comedy" with no spoken dialogue, Messager reached a turning point in his development. The crux of the plot was the same as that later used by [[Giacomo Puccini|Puccini]] for ''[[Madama Butterfly]]'' (1904): a young Japanese [[geisha]] wooed and then abandoned by a foreign sailor.&lt;ref name=traubner213/&gt; Messager's treatment of the story was praised for its sensitivity – reviewers in the Parisian press applauded him for raising opérette to the level of "comédie lyrique"&lt;ref&gt;Février, p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; – but he was a self-critical artist, and he felt he had strayed too far in the direction of opera and away from his chosen genre.&lt;ref name=h94/&gt; Harding suggests that the unusual seriousness of the score may be connected with the recent illness and death of Edith Messager.&lt;ref name=ha129&gt;Harding, p. 129&lt;/ref&gt; Both Hughes and Harding comment that Messager's score is subtler than Puccini's,{{refn|Reviewing ''Madama Butterfly'' at the Opéra-Comique in December 1908, Fauré, whose view of Puccini's music was less favourable than it later became, made a plea for a revival of ''Madame Chrysanthème''.&lt;ref&gt;Johnson, p. 299; and Wagstaff, p. 40&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} but add that the almost total eclipse of ''Madame Chrysanthème'' by ''Madama Butterfly'' may be partly due to the relative effectiveness of their libretti.&lt;ref name=h130&gt;Harding, p. 130; and Hughes, p. 94&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Messager's librettists ([[Georges Hartmann]] and Alexandre André) stuck closely to Loti's original with external local colour, whereas Puccini's, based on [[David Belasco]]'s stage play on the theme, added considerable extra incident to the mainly uneventful story, focusing on the private drama.&lt;ref name=h130/&gt;|group= n}} After this, Messager consciously simplified his style, greatly reducing the harmonic subtleties that had been characteristic of his earlier works.&lt;ref name=hu95&gt;Hughes, p. 95&lt;/ref&gt;

The works from the middle of the decade were unsuccessful financially and artistically. ''[[Le chevalier d'Harmental|Le Chevalier d'Harmental]]'' (1896), classed by Hughes as Messager's first true opéra comique ("in a somewhat pretentious style") was a failure, and an unpretentious opérette in the same year, ''La Fiancée en loterie'', fared no better.&lt;ref name=hu95/&gt; After these disappointments Messager finished the 1890s with two considerable successes. Traubner describes ''Les P'tites Michu'' (1897) as "a sensational hit",&lt;ref name=t214&gt;Traubner, p. 214&lt;/ref&gt; and Harding calls it the best of Messager's opérettes so far (classing ''Le Basoche'' as opéra comique, as did its composer).&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 132&lt;/ref&gt; The plot was not strikingly original: critics commented that its story of babies switched at birth was already very familiar from [[Gilbert and Sullivan]] operas.&lt;ref name=t214/&gt;{{refn|The device was a key plot point in ''[[H.M.S. Pinafore]]'' (1878) and ''[[The Gondoliers]]'' (1889).&lt;ref&gt;Bradley, pp. 248–249&lt;/ref&gt; A similar plot device had earlier been used by Offenbach in ''[[L'île de Tulipatan]]'' (1868).&lt;ref&gt;Traubner, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} Traubner describes the piece as "one of those unusual works that begin well enough and gets better and better".&lt;ref name=t214/&gt; Setting a scene in the market of [[Les Halles]] was not innovative, but Messager's chorus for the marchands and marchandes was out of the ordinary, and Traubner also singles out the duet for the Michus in Act 1: "clever, lilting&amp;nbsp;... pulsating with an elegance and grace that other operetta composers have failed to obtain".&lt;ref name=t214/&gt; He also judges the finales as outstanding, including a waltz number that in other hands would be predictable but is turned by Messager into something much more symphonic.&lt;ref name=t214/&gt;

The final work from the decade was ''Véronique''. Messager described it as an opéra comique, but commentators have classed it as a mixture of opérette and opéra comique.&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 133; and Traubner, p. 215&lt;/ref&gt; The score contains two of the composer's best known numbers, the "Swing duet" ("Poussez, poussez l'escarpolette") and the "Donkey duet" ("De ci, de la").&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 88&lt;/ref&gt; When the work was revived at the [[the Proms|Proms]] in London in the 1960s, the music critic of ''[[The Times]]'' commented, "Charming as it can prove in the theatre, the music alone is a little thin, with none of the piquancy that – thanks perhaps to Gilbert – redeems Messager's famous English contemporary Sullivan&amp;nbsp;... but ''Véronique'' has plenty of pretty things".&lt;ref&gt;"Véronique at the Proms", ''The Times'', 21 August 1967, p. 5&lt;/ref&gt; It became and has remained the composer's most performed musical theatre piece.&lt;ref name=wv&gt;Wagstaff, John.

===20th century===
[[File:Monsieur-beaucaire1.jpg|thumb|alt=Photo of a scene in upper-class 18th century costume, a young man kneeling and grasping the hand of a young woman, who is standing and leaning towards him|Marion Green and [[Maggie Teyte]] in ''[[Monsieur Beaucaire (opera)|Monsieur Beaucaire]]'', 1919]]
Messager's work running opera houses in Paris and London limited his composing between ''Véronique'' and the period after the First World War. ''[[Fortunio (opera)|Fortunio]]'' (1907) was a rare example in his oeuvre of a [[sung-through]] opera. Eight decades later the critic [[Edward Greenfield]] described it as "a long-buried jewel of a piece&amp;nbsp;... an improbable cross between musical comedy and ''Tristan und Isolde''".&lt;ref&gt;Greenfield, Edward. "Fortunio smiles: uncovering a Messager gem of charm and romance", ''The Guardian'', 15 July 1988, p. 24&lt;/ref&gt;{{refn|Unlike many of Messager's stage works, ''Fortunio'' was not seen in London shortly after the Parisian premiere: it was not given in Britain until 2001, when it was greeted as "an adorable blend of romanticism and Gallic cynicism" by ''[[The Sunday Telegraph]]'', "a little-known delight" by ''The Times'', "pure joy" by ''[[The Independent]]'' and "tosh of the highest order" by ''[[The Observer]]''.&lt;ref&gt;"Fortunio", ''The Guardian'', 14 July 2001, p. H17&lt;/ref&gt;|group= n}} From 1919 onwards Messager composed no more opéras comiques. Among his post-war stage works, ''[[Monsieur Beaucaire (opera)|Monsieur Beaucaire]]'', a "romantic operetta" (1919), was his second work to an English libretto. French critics were inclined to look down on "Messager's English operetta" as over-sweet and sentimental to suit Anglo-Saxon tastes.&lt;ref name=h141&gt;Harding, p. 141&lt;/ref&gt; Harding comments that the composer was successful in his attempt to produce an English flavour: one number is "pure [[Edward German]]" and there is much pastiche throughout the score. Despite the critics the piece ran well not only in Britain and the US, but also in France, with more than 300 performances in Paris and a long life in French provincial theatres.&lt;ref name=h141/&gt;&lt;ref name=mbnote/&gt;

Of Messager's 1920s comédies musicales the best known is ''[[L'amour masqué|L'Amour masqué]]'' (1923). The [[Théâtre Édouard VII]] where it was premiered had a small orchestra pit, and Messager developed a new style of orchestration to deliver his desired musical effects with a small number of players. Harding comments that the piece was up-to-date enough to include a [[tango]], "a beautifully written example with luscious harmonies that by contrast show up the threadbare nature of most other efforts of the time".&lt;ref name=harding147&gt;Harding, p. 147&lt;/ref&gt;

===Non-stage works and role in French music===
[[File:André-Messager-c1888.jpg|thumb|upright=0.7|alt=Head and shoulders photo of a youngish man with receding dark hair and large moustache, wearing striped suit|left|Messager in 1890]]
Messager wrote songs for solo voice with piano throughout his career. Like Fauré, he was fond of the poetry of [[Paul Armand Silvestre|Armand Sylvestre]], and from "La Chanson des cerises" in 1882 to the cycle ''Amour d'hiver'' in 1911 he set thirteen of Sylvestre's poems. Others whose verse he set ranged widely, from [[Victor Hugo]] to [[Frederic Weatherly]] (author of among other things "[[Danny Boy]]").&lt;ref name=grove/&gt;

In his old age Messager said that he would have liked to write more concert works, but had never had the opportunity.&lt;ref name=xd/&gt; The Symphony in A, written when he was 22, is on the normal classical plan with [[sonata form]] in the first and last movements, a songlike theme in the [[Tempo#Basic tempo markings|adagio]] and a [[scherzo]] third movement. Looking back he described it as "très classique".&lt;ref&gt;Wagstaff, p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; In notes to a 1992 recording of the piece, Xavier Deletang comments that although the influence of [[Felix Mendelssohn|Mendelssohn]] and possibly [[Robert Schumann|Schumann]] may be discernible, the work reveals a mastery of instrumentation and a quintessentially French flavour, particularly in the wind parts. The two main subjects of the Allegro ''con moto'' first movement are strongly contrasted, with the opening string theme followed by a chorale-like theme for the winds.&lt;ref name=xd&gt;Deletang, Xavier. Notes to Skarbo CD DSK 3921 (2001)&lt;/ref&gt;

When Messager was elected to membership of the Académie des Beaux-Arts in 1926 the influential musical journal ''[[Le Ménestrel]]'' remarked that this conferred on his chosen genre – opérette – official status and recognition;&lt;ref name=nytdeb&gt;"The Youthful Genius of Debussy", ''The New York Times'', 6 June 1926, p. X5&lt;/ref&gt; but his fame as a composer of light music has tended to obscure his considerable standing in contemporary serious musical circles. It was said of him that he had "seen all, heard all, and remembered all".&lt;ref&gt;Holoman, p. 328&lt;/ref&gt; The leading composers of the time valued his friendship and advice. Fauré called him "familiar with everything, knowing it all, fascinated by anything new".&lt;ref name=grove/&gt; Messager's younger colleague, the composer Reynaldo Hahn, wrote, "I do believe that no musician has ever loved music as much as André Messager did. In any case, it would be impossible to have a greater musical curiosity than he did, up to the end of his life, too."&lt;ref name=hahn&gt;Hahn, p. 110&lt;/ref&gt; Like Fauré, Messager wrote musical criticism for ''Le Figaro'' and other publications in the first decades of the 20th century. Unlike Fauré, who was known for his kindly reviews,&lt;ref&gt;Nectoux, Jean-Michel. [http://www.oxfordmusiconline.com/subscriber/article/grove/music/09366 "Fauré, Gabriel (Urbain)"], ''Grove Online'', Oxford Music Online, accessed 7 April 2018 {{subscription}}&lt;/ref&gt; Messager was frequently severe. His views carried weight: some of his criticisms were reported in the international press.&lt;ref&gt;"Events of Music Overseas", ''The New York Times'', 1 April 1923, p. X5&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1908 Fauré wrote of Messager, "There are not many examples in the history of music of an artist with such a complete education, of such profound knowledge, who consents to apply his gifts to forms regarded, nobody knows why, as secondary".&lt;ref name=fauré/&gt; ''[[Baker's Biographical Dictionary of Musicians]]'' says of Messager, "His style may be described as enlightened eclecticism; his music was characteristically French, and more specifically Parisian, in its elegance and gaiety."&lt;ref name=baker/&gt; In his book ''Composers of Operetta'', Hughes comments that Messager combined "a flow of spontaneous melody worthy of Offenbach with a flair for economic workmanship at least the equal of Lecocq's" and in much of his music "a measure of Massenet's fluent grace, Saint-Saëns's aristocratic elegance, even Fauré's refined subtlety".&lt;ref&gt;Hughes, p. 91&lt;/ref&gt; He observes that Messager spanned an entire era: "Auber, [[Gioacchino Rossini|Rossini]] and [[Giacomo Meyerbeer|Meyerbeer]] were still alive when he began his studies, yet he survived the First World War and witnessed the rise and decline of "[[les Six]]".&amp;nbsp;... For forty years he carried aloft the torch kindled by [[Adolphe Adam]] in 1834; after his death it soon flickered out".&lt;ref name=hu99&gt;Hughes, p. 99&lt;/ref&gt;

===Conductor===
[[File:Messager-dirigeant-lorchestre-de-lOpéra.jpg|thumb|left|upright|alt=caricature of elderly man in evening dress conducting an orchestra|Messager conducting at the Opéra, 1908]]
The wide range of Messager's musical sympathies was noted by ''Le Menéstral'', which said that he "has served Wagner, Debussy, Fauré, Ravel and [[Igor Stravinsky|Stravinsky]] when their works were still struggling for recognition".&lt;ref name=nytdeb/&gt; He was widely admired as a conductor. He avoided extravagant gesturing on the podium; Harding records, "His manner was precise and undemonstrative. The baton flicked neatly here and there in a way that meant little to the audience behind him but conveyed volumes to the orchestra".&lt;ref&gt;Harding, p. 126&lt;/ref&gt; The music critic [[Pierre Lalo]] wrote that under Messager's direction, ''Parsifal'', without losing any of its grandeur, "assumed a French clarity, and a sobriety, nobility and order&amp;nbsp;... even the most famous Bayreuth conductors have not always been able to do this."&lt;ref&gt;Lalo, p. 146. ''Quoted'' in English in Wagstaff, p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; Not everyone shared Lalo's view; some audience members equated undemonstrativeness with dullness: Reynaldo Hahn commented, "[Messager] is not a master of the theatre ["chef du théâtre"], being too exclusively musical; he sets too much store by detail without feeling the spirit of the public behind him, and does not understand the variable musical flow that makes one hold one's breath, sigh and wait."&lt;ref&gt;''Quoted'' in Wagstaff, pp. 38–39&lt;/ref&gt; Nevertheless, Hahn admired Messager as an orchestral conductor:
&lt;blockquote&gt; André Messager is the most French of conductors; I mean that in this art he embodies sharpness. Grace and clarity are not uniquely French qualities: they are frequently found among the Italians and even some Germans. But sharpness is a French virtue, and nothing but French. M. André Messager has it to an exceptional degree, and it shows in how he writes, orchestrates, dresses, talks, and plays the piano. But it is when he conducts the orchestra that what one might call his organic sharpness shows itself most forcefully.&lt;ref&gt;Hahn, Reynaldo, in ''Musica'', September 1908, ''quoted'' in Duteurtre, p. 161&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Recordings===
In 1918 Messager conducted recordings in New York, with the [[Orchestre de la Société des Concerts du Conservatoire]], of ''Les Chasseresses'' and ''Cortège de Bacchus'' from ''[[Sylvia (ballet)|Sylvia]]'' by [[Léo Delibes|Delibes]], Sérénade and Mules from ''Impressions d'Italie'' by Charpentier, the Bacchanale from ''Samson et Dalila'' and the Prelude to ''[[Le Déluge (Saint-Saëns)|Le Déluge]]'', both by Saint-Saëns, and 4½-minute extracts from ''[[Capriccio Espagnol|Capriccio espagnol]]'' by [[Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov|Rimsky-Korsakov]] and ''Le Rouet d'Omphale'' by Saint-Saëns.&lt;ref&gt;Holoman, D.

Rabbi '''Avraham Brandwein''' (died February 20, 2013&lt;ref name="JDN 2013"&gt;{{cite news |title=האדמו"ר שבחר לחיות בפשטות • הרה"צ אברהם ברנדווין זצ"ל |first=Asher |last=Klein |language=Hebrew |url=http://www.jdn.co.il/news/190018 |date=20 February 2013 |accessdate=17 September 2013|newspaper=JDN.co.il}}&lt;/ref&gt;), ''[[Rebbe|Admor]]'' of [[Stretin (Hasidc dynasty)|Stretin]], was a great [[Israelis|Israeli]] [[Kabbalah]] [[scholar]] and was a direct descendant of the famous first ''Admor'' of Stretin.

==Background==
His family tree included many of the great [[chassidic masters]], including the [[Maggid of Mezritsch]], [[Elimelech of Lizhensk]] and [[Levy Yitschak of Berditshev]]. Born in [[Israel]], Brandwein was the seventh generation in his family to live in Israel. His family originally settled in [[Tsfat]], the city of [[Kabbalists]].

His father, [[Rav Yehudah Tzvi]], was the previous ''Admor'' and a great scholar of Kabbalah.

Brandwein served in the [[Israel Defense Forces]] in artillery and was among the soldiers that crossed the [[Suez Canal]] into [[Egypt]] during the [[Yom Kippur war]].

==Ordination==
Rav Brandwein was ordained as a [[Rabbi]] by ''[[G'dolim]]'' representing the entire [[Orthodox Jewish|Orthodox community]] in Israel and also holds an M.A. He integrated [[Charedi life]] with active participation in the life of the modern state. Brandwein served as a rabbi in the [[Absorption and Immigration Department]] of the [[Jewish Agency]] providing spiritual assistance to many new immigrants.

==Teaching and writing==
Since 1985, he taught [[Torah]] and [[Hasidic philosophy|Chassidut]] throughout Israel. A widely respected scholar, he edited more than twenty volumes of classical Kabbalistic texts. A soft spoken, gentle man of great inner strength, hundreds of people turned to him every year for spiritual guidance and support.

Brandwein established a ''[[yeshiva]]'' in the [[Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem)|Jewish Quarter]] of the [[Old City (Jerusalem)|Old City]] of [[Jerusalem]] where he taught Kabbalah. He was known for the depth and clarity of his teachings and strived to bring [[Jews]] back to Torah.

==Death==
Brandwein died on February 20, 2013, aged 67, in the [[Hadassah Medical Center]] in [[Ein Kerem]] in [[Jerusalem]], after several months' illness. He was buried in the [[Mount of Olives Jewish Cemetery]], next to his wife, Tzipora, who had died four years previously.&lt;ref name="JDN 2013"/&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1519">'''Baruch of Benevento''' was an Italian Jewish [[Kabbalah|Cabalist]] in [[Naples]], during the first half of the 16th century.

He was the teacher of [[Cardinal Ægidius of Viterbo]] and of [[Johann Albrecht Widmanstadt]] in the ''[[Zohar]]'' and other cabalistic works, and lectured on these subjects in the house of [[Samuel Abravanel]]. In a note at the end of one of his manuscripts, Widmanstadt says: "Eodem tempore (MDXLI.) audivi Baruch Beneventanum optimum cabalistam, qui primus libros Zoharis per Ægidium Viterbiensem Cardinalem in Christianos vulgavit."

Graetz, Perles, and others have taken this to mean that Baruch translated the ''Zohar'', or parts of it, into Latin; but Steinschneider has remarked that it means nothing more than that he made the ''Zohar'' known to Christian scholars.

'''Batty Langley''' (''baptised'' 14 September 1696 – 3 March 1751) was an [[England|English]] [[garden designer]], and prolific writer who produced a number of engraved designs for "[[Gothic Revival architecture|Gothick]]" structures, summerhouses and garden seats in the years before the mid-18th century.

An eccentric [[landscape designer]], he gave four of his sons the names [[Hiram (disambiguation)|Hiram]], [[Euclid]], [[Vitruvius]] and [[Archimedes]].  He published extensively, and attempted to "improve" [[Gothic art|Gothic]] forms by giving them classical proportions.

[[File:BattyLangleygarden.jpg|thumb|right|250px|A garden plan]]

==Early life==
Langley was baptised in [[Twickenham]], Middlesex, the son of a jobbing gardener Daniel Langley and his wife Elizabeth.  He bore the name of David Batty, one of his fathers' patrons. He started worked as a gardener, inheriting some of his father's clients in Twickenham, then a village of suburban [[villa]]s within easy reach of London by a pleasant water journey on the [[River Thames|Thames]]. An early client was [[Thomas Vernon (1666-1726)|Thomas Vernon]] of [[Twickenham Park]].

He married Anne Smith in February 1719.  They had four children, but she died in June 1726.   He had ten further children with his second wife, Catherine.
 
==Landscape gardening==
Langley moved into surveying and [[landscape gardening]].  He published his first book, ''Practical Geometry'', in 1726.  Inspired by [[Stephen Switzer|Switzer]]'s ''Ichnographia Rustica'' of 1718, Langley advocated more irregular, informal gardens, with rococo "arti-natural" landscaping.  His sinuous forms predated Hogath's [[line of beauty]].

For the [[Palladian architecture|Palladian]] house built at Twickenham by [[James Johnston (Secretary of State)|James Johnston]] in 1710 (later "Orleans House", demolished 1926), Langley, probably on his own endeavour, prepared and published a garden plan, which offered an encyclopaedia of the garden features that were swiftly becoming obsolete by the time the plan (''illustration, right'') was published in Langley's ''A Sure Method of Improving Estates'' (1728): here are several [[maze]]s, a "wilderness" with many tortuous path-turnings, ''cabinets de verdure'' cut into dense woodland, formal stretches of canal and formally shaped basins of water, some with central fountains, a central [[Avenue (landscape)|allée]] of trees leading to an [[exedra]].

His ''New Principles of Gardening'' (1728) included designs for mazes, a feature he could never quite leave behind, with 28 plates engraved by his brother Thomas. He also published ''A Sure Method of Improving Estates'' (1728) and ''Pomona'' (1729).

He also undertook work at [[Castle Howard]] and [[Wrest Park]].

==Architecture==
Langley moved from Twickenham to London in 1729, and shifted again from landscape gardening to architecture.   Working near [[Exeter Change]] in the Strand, he published ''A Sure Guide to Builders'' in 1729.  He moved to Westminster in the 1730s, where he started to teach drawing, geometry, architecture, and garden design, and continued to teach when he moved to Soho in 1738.   He also made and sold stone garden ornaments.

Despite his literary aspirations, and advertisements in architectural journals, he secured few commissions, submitting an unsolicited proposal for the competition to design a new [[Mansion House, London|Mansion House]] in 1735 and a design for a new [[Westminster Bridge]] in 1736-7.  He inclined strongly towards a home-grown English architectural form, publishing articles in the [[Grub Street Journal]] under the pseudonym "Hiram" from July 1734 to March 1735, praising [[Gothic architecture]] (or as he termed it "native Saxon") and rejecting the "imported" [[Palladian architecture]] favoured by [[Lord Burlington]] and his circle.

He published a wide range of architectural  books, from a huge folio on ''Ancient Masonry'' in parts from 1733 to 1736 with over 450 plates, through ''The Builder's Complete Assistant'' of 1738 (also known as ''The Builder's Complete Chest-Book'') and ''The Builder's Jewel'' of 1741, to the tiny ''The Workman's Golden Rule'' in 1750, in vicesimo-quarto.

He is best known for one of his confident self-promotions, ''Ancient Architecture, Restored, and Improved'' published in 1742 and reissued in 1747 as ''Gothic Architecture, improved by Rules and Proportions'', a bit of cockscombry that thoroughly irritated [[Horace Walpole, 4th Earl of Orford|Horace Walpole]], whose Gothick villa at Twickenham, [[Strawberry Hill House|Strawberry Hill]], gave impetus to the stirrings of the [[Gothic Revival]]:

&lt;blockquote&gt;All that his books achieved, has been to teach carpenters to massacre that venerable species, and to give occasion to those who know nothing of the matter, and who mistake his clumsy efforts for real imitations, to censure the productions of our ancestors, whose bold and beautiful fabrics Sir [[Christopher Wren]] viewed and reviewed with astonishment, and never mentioned without esteem. (Walpole, ''Anecdotes of Painting'', 1798, p 484)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

His book, with engravings by his brother [[Thomas Langley]], attempted to improve Gothic forms by giving them classical proportions and to create a scheme of architectural orders for Gothic architecture.  He provided inspiration for elements of buildings from [[Great Fulford]] and [[Hartland Abbey]] in Devon, to [[Speedwell Castle]] in [[Brewood]] in Staffordshire, and [[Tissington Hall]] in Derbyshire, and the Gothic temple at [[Bramham Park]] in Yorkshire, and gates at [[Castletown House]] in County Kildare.

Langley's books were also enormously influential in Britain's American colonies.  At [[Mount Vernon]], for example, [[George Washington]] relied upon plate 51 of Langley's ''The City and Country Builder's and Workman's Treasury of Designs'' as the source for the famous Venetian (or Palladian) window  in the dining room; upon plate 54 of the same book for the ocular window on Mount Vernon's western facade; and upon plate 75 of Langley's ''The Builder's Jewel'' for the rusticated wood siding.&lt;ref&gt;[[The Center for Palladian Studies in America, Inc.]], [http://www.palladiancenter.org/patternbooks.html "Palladio and Architectural Patternbooks in Colonial America."]&lt;/ref&gt;

Batty Langley was also thought to be an important [[Freemason]]; his naming of his son Hiram was a reference to the architect, prominent in Masonic tradition and symbolism, of Solomon's Temple, and many of his books were dedicated to his Masonic brethren. The ''frontispiece'' to ''The Builder's Jewel'' (1741), for example, contains many examples of Masonic symbolism found in the first three degrees of Freemasonry.&lt;ref&gt;See Eileen Harris, ''Batty Langley: A Tutor to Freemasons (1696-1751)'', ''The Burlington Magazine'', Vol.119, No 890, May 1977&lt;/ref&gt;

He was imprisoned for debt in [[Newgate Prison]] and wrote an account of that institution, ''An Accurate Description of Newgate''.&lt;ref&gt;[https://books.google.com/books?id=IahbAAAAQAAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false An Accurate Description of Newgate at Google Books]&lt;/ref&gt; He died at home in Soho.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/16022|title=‘Langley, Batty (bap. 1696, d. 1751)|last=Harris|first=Eileen|year=2004|work=[[Oxford Dictionary of National Biography]]|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|doi=10.1093/ref:odnb/16022|accessdate=2009-10-11}} {{ODNBsub}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Boller and Chivens''' was an American manufacturer of high-quality [[telescope]]s and [[spectrometer|spectrograph]]s headquartered in [[South Pasadena, California]].

==History==
Founded about 1946 by Harry Berthold Boller (1915-1997) and Clyde Cuthbertson Chivens (1915-2008).&lt;ref&gt;Approximate year of founding is given by Peter Abrahams in a blog posting reproduced at [http://www.chesmontastro.org/?q=node/4355]. Harry Boller and Clyde Chivens were engineers with degrees from [[California Institute of Technology]]. See Oral History Transcript - Dr. Ira Bowen, August 26, 1969, at [http://www.aip.org/history/ohilist/4524_2.html]. (Chivens was in the Class of 1935. See Clyde Chivens obituary, ''The Tribune'', San Luis Obispo, Ca, March 4, 2008. See also California Institute of Technology, ''Engineering and Science'', "News of Classes," Volume 1:4, March 1938, at [http://calteches.library.caltech.edu/317/1/newsofclasses.pdf]. Chivens worked in the [[Office of Scientific Research and Development]] during World War II. See Folder 2.9 containing OSRD report by Chivens in Guide to the Joseph Foladare Papers, 1943-1946 at [http://www.oac.cdlib.org/data/13030/wd/tf1m3n97wd/files/tf1m3n97wd.pdf].)  Harry Boller and Clyde Chivens were also associated in a firm called High Vacuum Electronics (later called Kilovac, now part of [[Tyco Electronics]]), incorporated in California in 1964. See articles of incorporation at [http://www.secinfo.com/dsvRs.717d.b.htm].

Birth and death dates from [http://ssdi.rootsweb.ancestry.com/cgi-bin/ssdi.cgi Social Security Death Index.]&lt;/ref&gt; the company was acquired in 1965 by [[PerkinElmer|Perkin-Elmer]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/courant/access/924555702.html?dids=924555702:924555702&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:AI&amp;type=historic&amp;date=Mar+04%2C+1965&amp;author=&amp;pub=Hartford+Courant&amp;desc=Perkin-Elmer+Buys+California+Corporation&amp;pqatl=google "Perkin-Elmer Buys California Corporation," ''Hartford Courant'', Hartford, CT, March 4, 1965, p. 38.]&lt;/ref&gt;

In the 1950s, Boller and Chivens collaborated with Perkin-Elmer to develop and manufacture the large-aperture [[Baker-Nunn camera|Baker-Nunn satellite tracking camera]] for the United States [[Project Vanguard|Vanguard]] space satellite program.&lt;ref&gt;[https://history.nasa.gov/SP-4202/chapter9.html NASA, ''Vanguard: A History'', Chapter 9, "The Tracking Systems" (see note 17).]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Brahim Zniber''' (1920–2016) was a Moroccan businessman. Through Diana Holding, he was the founder and the owner of [[Celliers de Meknès]], the largest wine producer in Morocco, and owned 85% of the country's wine production. From the 1970s onward, he expanded into fruit and poultry production, and [[Coca-Cola]] bottling plants.

==Early life==
Brahim Zniber was born in 1920 in [[Salé]], Morocco.&lt;ref name="forbesnsehedeath"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Nsehe|first1=Mfonobong|title=Moroccan Multi-millionaire Brahim Zniber Dies at 96|url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/mfonobongnsehe/2016/10/01/moroccan-multi-millionaire-brahim-zniber-dies-at-96/#59c279ac37f1|accessdate=October 2, 2016|work=Forbes|date=October 1, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He grew up in [[Sidi Kacem]], then known as Petit Jean.&lt;ref name="telquelobit"&gt;{{cite news|title=Le milliardaire Brahim Zniber s’est éteint|url=https://telquel.ma/2016/09/30/brahim-zniber-nest_1516709|accessdate=October 1, 2016|work=[[TelQuel]]|date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father, [[Taher Zniber]], was a cereal and wool merchant who was active in the [[Koutla]] political coalition.&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt; He had five brothers and four sisters.&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt;

Zniber studied [[arboriculture]] and [[viticulture]] remotely, taking courses at the Ecole universitaire de Paris.&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt; While he was a student, he became a nationalist activist, serving under [[Mehdi Ben Barka]].&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt; He hid in a remote location near Meknes to flee persecution.&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt;

==Career==
Zniber began his career in wine-making in 1956, when he purchased 740 hectares in [[Ait Harz Allah]].&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt; Meanwhile, he joined the board of directors of the regional chapter of the [[Crédit agricole du Maroc]].&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt; By 1958, he founded the Union marocaine de l’agriculture, a trade organization for Moroccan agriculture.&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt;

Zniber was granted 1,100 hectares by King [[Hassan II of Morocco|Hassan II]] in 1958, as French settlers were deprived of their landholdings in the wake of Morocco's independence.&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt;&lt;ref name="decestv5monde"&gt;{{cite news|title=Décès du "premier vigneron" du Maroc, le millionnaire Brahim Zniber|url=http://information.tv5monde.com/en-continu/deces-du-premier-vigneron-du-maroc-le-millionnaire-brahim-zniber-131327|accessdate=October 1, 2016|work=TV5Monde|date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ftmoroccosatlasmountainsseek"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Lindsey|first1=Ursula|title=Morocco’s Atlas Mountains seek place on winemaking map|url=https://www.ft.com/content/0daacbf4-cb48-11e5-a8ef-ea66e967dd44|accessdate=October 1, 2016|work=Financial Times|date=March 23, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; By 1964, he founded Samavin,&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt; later known as Celliers de Meknès.&lt;ref name="decestv5monde"/&gt; He was responsible for the growth of the wine industry in the [[Meknès Prefecture]] and [[Benslimane Province]] from the 1960s onwards.&lt;ref name="bonte145"&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Bonte|first1=Marie|title=Ethiques et pratiques éthyliques en milieu urbain marocain|journal=Confluences Méditerranée|date=2011|volume=3|issue=78|pages=145–156|doi=10.3917/come.078.0145|url=http://www.cairn.info/article.php?ID_ARTICLE=COME_078_0145&amp;DocId=162800&amp;hits=771+770+710+709+|accessdate=October 1, 2016|via=[[Cairn.info]]|registration=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2014, Zniber was the owner of 2,000 hectares of vineyards near Meknes through Celliers de Meknès, and he sold 35 million bottles every year, making him the largest wine producer in Morocco.&lt;ref name="forbes5moroccanmultmillionaires"/&gt; His flagship vineyard was [[Château Roslane]].&lt;ref name="ftmoroccosatlasmountainsseek"/&gt; His holding company, Diana Holding, had a payroll of 8,000 and annual sales of US$3 billion.&lt;ref name="forbes5moroccanmultmillionaires"/&gt; His investments included the production of [[olive oil]] under the brandname of [[CaracTerre]] and wine via Celliers de Meknès as well as "meat processing and commercial [[Plant nursery|nurseries]]".&lt;ref name="forbes5moroccanmultmillionaires"/&gt;

By 2016, Zniber owned 85% of Morocco's wine production,&lt;ref name="decestv5monde"/&gt; and 8,300 hectares.&lt;ref name="telquelobit"/&gt; Diana Holding was the seventh largest privately owned company in Morocco.&lt;ref name="decestv5monde"/&gt; His main competitor was [[Groupe Castel]].&lt;ref name="bonte145"/&gt;

==Personal life and death==

'''Celia Kitzinger''' and '''Sue Wilkinson''' are a [[United Kingdom|British]] [[lesbian]] couple who lobbied to have their relationship recognised as a [[marriage]] in [[England]].

==Celia Kitzinger==
Kitzinger is [[Professor]] of Conversation Analysis, Gender and Sexuality in the Department of Sociology at the [[University of York]].

She has a career in academia, having published nine books and contributed over one hundred articles relating to [[language]], [[feminism]] and [[Homosexuality|homosexual]] issues. Kitzinger earned a [[Master of Arts (Oxford, Cambridge and Dublin)|MA]] degree from the [[University of Oxford]] and a PhD from the [[University of Reading]]. After having served from 1999–2000 as [[Visiting scholar|Visiting Professor]] at the [[University of California, Los Angeles|University of California at Los Angeles]], she accepted her current post at York.

Kitzinger is also qualified as being a chartered [[psychologist]] within the [[British Psychological Society]], of which she was elected [[fellow]] in 1997. Furthermore, the [[American Psychological Association]] has also honoured her by accepting her as fellow in 2000.

Currently, Professor Kitzinger is using [[conversation analysis]] to explore the ordinary mundane reproduction of [[heterosexism]] in everyday talk-in-interaction, and aside from her work at the University of York she also serves as associate editor of ''[[Feminism &amp; Psychology]]''.

==Sue Wilkinson==
Wilkinson is Professor of Feminist and Health Studies in the Department of Social Sciences at [[Loughborough University]] in [[Leicestershire]].

Wilkinson completed her undergraduate studies at the [[University of Leicester]], graduating with a [[Bachelor of Science|BSc]] degree in psychology. From there, she proceeded to earn a PhD specialising in gender issues, particularly regarding the role of women in psychology.

Wilkinson's first academic post was as a lecturer at the [[University of Liverpool]]; following this she took position as Head of the Psychology department at [[Coventry University]]. After Coventry, Wilkinson accepted a research post at the [[University of Hull]], then left this post to accept a Visiting Professorship at the [[University of Waikato]]. After this position in 1999, Wilkinson was granted a full professorship at Loughborough, having been associated with the university since 1994. Despite this, Professor Wilkinson decided to accept a sabbatical between 2001 and 2002; she spent this year firstly working at the [[University of California, Santa Barbara]], and then serving as a visiting scholar at the University of California, Los Angeles. The following year she took special leave to take chair as the Ruth Wynn Woodward Endowed Professor of Women's Studies at [[Simon Fraser University]], [[Canada]]. It was whilst in Canada that Professor Kitzinger and Professor Wilkinson decided to marry.

Wilkinson has received great recognition as an accomplished academic,{{Citation needed|date=June 2010}} and has a strong involvement with the British Psychological Society, being instrumental in the foundation of its ''Psychology of Women'' section, for which she served as the first head, and also its ''Lesbian and Gay Psychology'' section.

Wilkinson is currently{{When|date=June 2010}} researching the expression of emotions in talk-in-interaction, as part of her role at Loughborough. Wilkinson has co-authored four books with Kitzinger, and serves as the editor of the academic journal ''Feminism &amp; Psychology''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Wilkinson | first1 = Sue | title = Making connections: Feminism &amp; Psychology and the BPS 'psychology of women' section (editorial) | journal = [[Feminism &amp; Psychology]] | volume = 6 | issue = 4 | pages = 477–480 | publisher = [[SAGE Publications|Sage]] | doi = 10.1177/0959353596064001 | date = November 1996 | url = https://dx.doi.org/10.1177/0959353596064001 | ref = harv| postscript = .}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The couple married in [[Yaletown]], [[Vancouver]], in August 2003, a few weeks after [[Same-sex marriage in British Columbia|same-sex marriage]] became legal in [[British Columbia]], where Wilkinson had been working as a Visiting Professor at Simon Fraser University. On their return to the UK, the couple discovered that their relationship had no legal status at all. Two years later, with the implementation of the [[Civil Partnership Act 2004|Civil Partnership Act]], the relationship was automatically converted to a [[civil partnership]].

The couple sued for the recognition of their marriage, the trial beginning on 5 June 2006 before Sir [[Mark Potter (judge)|Mark Potter]], [[President of the Family Division]]. For an overseas marriage to be recognised in the UK, it must be shown that the marriage was legal, recognised in the country in which it was executed, and that nothing in the country's law restricted freedom to marry; Kitzinger and Wilkinson argued that their marriage fulfilled these requirements even though people cannot legally enter into same-sex marriages in the UK. They rejected entering a civil partnership, believing them to be both symbolically and practically a lesser substitute, and asked the court to recognise their overseas marriage in the same way that it would recognise the marriage of an opposite-sex couple. They argued that a failure to do so breached their [[human rights]] under Articles 8 (right to respect for privacy and family life), 12 (right to marry) and 14 (prohibition of discrimination), taken together with Article 8 and/or 12 of the [[European Convention on Human Rights]], which was incorporated into domestic UK law by the [[Human Rights Act 1998]].

In a 21 September 2005 press release issued by [[Liberty (pressure group)|Liberty]],&lt;ref name="Libertypressrelease"&gt;[http://www.equalmarriagerights.org/PressReleases.html Liberty: Press Releases - equalmarriagerights.org]&lt;/ref&gt; the British [[civil rights]] organisation which supported their case, Kitzinger and Wilkinson said: &lt;blockquote&gt;This is fundamentally about equality. We want our marriage to be recognised as a marriage - just like any other marriage made in Canada. It is insulting and discriminatory to be offered a civil partnership instead. Civil partnerships are an important step forward for same-sex couples, but they are not enough. We want full equality in marriage.&lt;ref name="Libertypressrelease" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;James Welch, Legal Director at Liberty, said: &lt;blockquote&gt;Our clients entered into a legal marriage in Canada. It is a matter of fairness and equality that they should be treated the same way as any other couple who marries abroad: their marriage should be recognised here. They shouldn't have to settle for the second-best option of a civil partnership.&lt;ref name="Libertypressrelease" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;The [[High Court of Justice|High Court]] announced its judgement on 31 July 2006, finding that the marriage would continue to be recognised as a civil partnership in England and Wales, but not as a marriage.&lt;ref name="BBCNews5230708"&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/england/north_yorkshire/5230708.stm BBC News: Lesbians lose legal marriage bid]&lt;/ref&gt; In handing down his ruling, the President of the Family Division, Sir Mark Potter, gave as his reason that "Abiding single sex relationships are in no way inferior, nor does English Law suggest that they are by according them recognition under the name of civil partnership"&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/player/nol/newsid_5230000/newsid_5230800/5230826.stm?bw=bb&amp;mp=wm&amp;news=1&amp;ms3=6&amp;ms_javascript=true&amp;bbcws=2 BBC News: Lesbians lose legal marriage bid (video)]&lt;/ref&gt; and that marriage was an "age-old institution" which, he suggested, was by "longstanding definition and acceptance" a relationship between a man and a woman. He described this as an "insurmountable hurdle" to the couple's case.&lt;ref name="BBCNews5230708" /&gt; While agreeing that they were discriminated against by the [[Civil Partnership Act 2004]], he considered that "To the extent that by reason of that distinction it discriminates against same-sex partners, such discrimination has a legitimate aim, is reasonable and proportionate, and falls within the margin of appreciation accorded to Convention States."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Fam/2006/2022.html Wilkinson v Kitzinger &amp; Ors &amp;#91;2006&amp;#93; EWHC 2022 (Fam) (31 July 2006)], paragraph 122&lt;/ref&gt; The Attorney General, as Second Respondent, sought £25,000 in costs.

The couple announced their intention to appeal against the decision of the High Court, but later abandoned this due to lack of funds.

On 13 March 2014, their overseas marriage was recognised by the Government as a legal marriage as the [[Marriage (Same Sex Couples) Act 2013]] came into force.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/society/2014/mar/13/gay-couple-wed-overseas-same-sex-marriages-england The Guardian: Gay couple who wed overseas celebrate in UK as same-sex marriage law arrives]

'''Christian Jacob Protten''' also '''Christian Jakobus Africanus Protten''' or '''Uldrich''' (15 September 1715 – 24 August or 23 October 1769) was a [[Gold Coast Euro-Africans|Euro-African]] [[Moravian Church|Moravian]] missionary pioneer, linguist, translator and educationalist-administrator in [[Osu, Accra|Christiansborg]] on the [[Danish Gold Coast]] in the eighteenth century.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dacb.org/stories/ghana/protten-cj/|title=Christian Jacob Protten|last=Smith|first=Noel|date=|website=dacb.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://dacb.org/stories/ghana/protten-chrisjacob/|title=Christian Jacob Protten|last=Dreydoppel|first=Otto|date=|website=dacb.org|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":3"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Simonsen|first=Gunvor|date=April 2015|title=Belonging in Africa: Frederik Svane and Christian Protten on the Gold Coast in the Eighteenth Century|url=https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/itinerario/article/belonging-in-africa-frederik-svane-and-christian-protten-on-the-gold-coast-in-the-eighteenth-century/FD50A3811C421A5A91D9B1E2F7613BEA|journal=Itinerario|language=en|volume=39|issue=1|pages=91–115|doi=10.1017/S0165115315000145|issn=0165-1153|via=|access-date=14 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20180618045639/https://www.cambridge.org/core/journals/itinerario/article/belonging-in-africa-frederik-svane-and-christian-protten-on-the-gold-coast-in-the-eighteenth-century/FD50A3811C421A5A91D9B1E2F7613BEA|archive-date=18 June 2018|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=A History of Moravian Missions|last=Hutton|first=J.

== Early life ==
=== Ancestry and family ===
Christian Jacob Protten was born on 15 September 1715 in Christiansborg, Gold Coast, now known as the suburb of [[Osu, Accra]] in Ghana.&lt;ref name=":5"&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.geni.com/people/Christian-Jakobus-Protten/6000000016682022141|title=Christian Jakobus Protten|website=geni_family_tree|language=en-US|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":9" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://aner.svaner.com/Svane_om/Svane_DK/Famous_persons/Africanus_dk.htm|title=Belonging in Africa: Frederik Svane and Christian Protten on the Gold Coast in the Eighteenth Century|last=|first=|date=|website=aner.svaner.com|language=en|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; His Danish father, Jacob Protten, alias "Prot", "Prodt", "Prott," was a soldier stationed with the garrison at the Christiansborg Castle in Osu.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; His [[Ga-Adangbe people|Ga]] mother of [[Togo|Togolese]] ancestry, was a princess and the daughter of a chief or king, Nii Ofori Ashangmo, the ruler of the Ga state from 1660 to 1680.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Historical records list his mother’s name simply by her initials, “N. N.”.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;  Protten had two older siblings: a brother, Wilhelm or Friderich Protten (born 28 April 1709) and a sister, Anna Protten (born 2 February, 1713), both raised in Christiansborg.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; Archival records indicate that Christian Protten’s maternal uncle, Ashangmo, also Foli Bebe or Ofori Bembeneen was a coastal chieftain in the former Portuguese slave market of [[Aného|Little Popo]] (Aného) in modern-day Togo, and ruled the Guin/Ge State there from 1694 to 1727 or 1731/33.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt; After the passing of Ashangmo, his son, Assiongbon Dandjin became the new ruler at Aneho sometime between 1731/33 and 1737. Christian Protten appears to have been a candidate for succession but only matrilineally.

=== Education ===
Christian Protten’s early education was at the Danish language-[[Osu Castle|Christiansborg Castle School]] for mulattoes, where he was tutored by a [[Lutheranism|Lutheran]] minister.&lt;ref name=":6"&gt;{{Cite journal|last=|first=|date=June  2012|title=This Month in Moravian History: Christian Protten - Missionary to the Gold Coast of Africa|url=http://www.moravianchurcharchives.org/thismonth/12_06%20Protten.pdf|journal=Moravian Archives|location=Bethlehem, PA.|volume=|issue=74|pages=|via=|access-date=14 October 2018|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160914181657/http://www.moravianchurcharchives.org/thismonth/12_06%20Protten.pdf|archive-date=14 September 2016|dead-url=no|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; With the confines of the fort, Protten was introduced to [[Christianity]] and mastered the [[Danish language]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  In 1726, at the age of 11, he was chosen and sent to Copenhagen, Denmark, together with another Euro-African pupil, Friederich Pedersen.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Tribute for the Negro|last=Wilson|first=Armistead|publisher=|year=1848|isbn=|location=Manchester|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Protten recalled that the decision to send him to a school in Denmark was against his will.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; His mother's family was also against this development. On the day of his departure, as he was rowed out to the waiting ship, his relatives stood on the beach, hoping the canoe would capsize and Protten would return to safety on the shore. At the age of 12, [[Frederick IV of Denmark|King Frederick IV of Denmark]] (reigned 1699–1730) took interest in his welfare and became his godfather at his baptism on 27 November, 1727.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; After his baptism, he assumed the name Christian Jacob Protten. Protten then enrolled in a trade apprenticeship to become a [[blacksmith]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Initially, he was disheartened to partake in the vocational training as he desired a more academic education.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In 1732, he finally matriculated at the [[University of Copenhagen]] where he studied [[theology]], completing his studies in 1735 at the age of twenty.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 1735, Christian Protten met [[Nicolaus Zinzendorf|Nikolaus Ludwig, Reichsgraf von Zinzendorf und Pottendorf]] (1700–60), the Bishop of the [[Moravian Church]], at the Danish court.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Dietrich|first=Meyer,|title=Lieberkühn, Samuel|url=https://referenceworks.brillonline.com/entries/religion-past-and-present/lieberkuhn-samuel-SIM_13018|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Shortly thereafter, he became acquainted with the Moravian fellowship and moved to [[Herrnhut]], the Moravian colony at [[Berthelsdorf|Berthelsdolf]], which later became Saxony, staying there for the next twelve months and learning German along the way.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Protten was deeply unhappy in Germany, noting in his diary that that Europeans described him as “''afrikanisch wild''” (African savage) and “''mohrisch''” (Moorish).&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Manuscript: Diarium of/by Christian Jakob Protten Africanus (1715-1769)|last=|first=|publisher=|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1737, Christian Protten, along with Moravia native, Henry Huckoff, sailed from [[Amsterdam]], the [[Netherlands]] to the Gold Coast to begin a new life as Moravian missionaries..&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Commenting on Protten’s perceived conceitedness, Zinzendorf wrote, ''“Protten has a high opinion of himself. Presumptiveness and a high opinion of oneself only prostitute a person and carry no weight with the Saviour''.”&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; He was alleged to have been prone to fits of uncontrollable anger. Prior his departure to the Gold Coast, Count Zinzendorf instructed, ''“Dear Christian: In order to convert the Moors, you must leave all your Moorish bad habits in Amsterdam.”'' &lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Despite these negative remarks before his departure, Protten was nonetheless tasked with establishing a school for Euro-African children in [[Elmina]]. The ship docked at Elmina on 11 May 1737.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Henry Huckuff passed away, presumably from fever, a month after their arrival. This new situation resulted in a change in plans for Protten who ended up visiting his mother in Little Popo/Aného, [[Togo]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  According to the Gold Coast historian and Basel Mission pastor, [[Carl Christian Reindorf]], Protten visited his relatives at [[Aného]] in September 1737. He was reportedly kept there against his will and only returned to Osu in 1739.  

His plans to start a school at Elmina were thwarted by the Dutch Governor at the time, [[List of colonial governors of the Dutch Gold Coast|Martinus François de Bordes]] who viewed Protten as a Danish spy and detained him for three years until 1740.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  de Bordes died in office on 16 March 1740. The political situation at the time was unfavourable as the Dutch had waged a war against the [[Dahomey|Dahomey.]]&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  During Protten’s imprisonment in Elmina, he was infected with [[malaria]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Upon his release, he served as an educator for a year. In 1741, upon the receipt of a letter of invitation from von Zinzendorf, Christian Protten returned to Herrnhut, after failing to win converts on the Gold Coast..&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  In 1743, he sailed to the island of [[Saint Thomas, U.S. Virgin Islands|Saint Thomas]] in the [[West Indies]] as an independent missionary..&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  While in the Caribbean, he remained detached from other missionaries there.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  He returned to Germany in 1745 with the aim of going back to the Gold Coast.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  However, the Moravian leaders were not in favour of that proposal, although homesick Protten was desperate to return to his homeland.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  He therefore remained in the Moravian communities for the next decade.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

There were constant tensions between Zinzendorf and Protten due to the latter’s alcoholism and alleged haughtiness.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; In 1756, Protten and his wife, Rebecca were banished from the Moravian commune in Herrnhut to the village of [[Großhennersdorf]] in the [[Görlitz]] district.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; He received permission to return to West Africa, leaving his wife, who rejoined the religious community at Herrnhut.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

In 1757, he received his commission from the Royal Chartered Danish West India and [[Guinea Company (London)|Guinea Company]] to become a teacher and a preacher at his alma mater, the Christiansborg Castle School.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  As the vessel approached the West African coast, it landed on the [[Pepper Coast|Grain Coast]] (now [[Liberia]]) where he stayed for almost four months.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  He arrived in Christiansborg in June 1757 and reconnected with his family.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  He returned to Europe in July 1761, arriving in Herrnhut in 1762; he reunited with his wife and the other Moravians.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  This particular journey occurred after the death of a [[Gold Coast Euro-Africans|Euro-African]] pupil, who Protten had accidentally shot while cleaning his rifle at the castle. Christian Protten was briefly imprisoned for this incident.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;   In 1765, he returned to the Gold Coast with his wife, Rebecca. With the blessing of the Moravian church, he became the schoolmaster of the castle school until his death in 1769.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;  Earlier in 1764, he had submitted a proposal to the Danish Crown, [[Frederick V of Denmark|King Frederick V of Denmark]] (reigned 1746-66), to establish a boarding school at Christiansborg which would include a curriculum in indigenous languages, highlighting the importance he attached to literacy in his mother tongue.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; 

Historians have concluded that his education and mission initiatives on the Gold Coast were essentially failed projects. His last years in Christiansborg seem to have been troubled. In the final decades of the 18th century, several other Moravian missionaries who were sent from Europe did not survive beyond the first few months due to tropical afflictions, particularly malaria and yellow fever.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

=== Foray into linguistics ===
In 1764, Christian Jacob Protten wrote his [[Masterpiece|magnum opus]], "''En nyttig Grammaticalsk Indledelse til Tvende hidintil gandske ubekiendte Sprog, Fanteisk og Acraisk''," an introductory treatise to the grammar of the [[Ga language|Ga]] and [[Fante dialect|Fante]] languages which was published in [[Copenhagen]].&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; Seen as his greatest achievement, the text acted as trilingual (Danish, Fante, Ga) catechesis manual for European missionaries who yearned to learn the two Ghanaian native languages. Furthermore, Protten translated [[Martin Luther]]’s ''Smaller Catechism'' into the Fante and Ga languages..&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt;

The Freundlichs were persecuted and imprisoned for their Christian faith while they were sharing the Gospel to slaves in Saint Thomas.&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Rebecca Freundlich had a daughter, Anna Maria Freundlich, from her first marriage, who was born circa 1740, on the island of Saint Thomas, now the US Virgin Islands.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; Anna Freundlich died in 1744, aged 4 years, in Germany.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The Freundlich family had travelled to Germany due to Matthaus Freundlich’s ill-health.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; He however died during the voyage across Germany.&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt; In 1750, Christian and Rebecca Protten had a daughter, Anna Maria Protten who died in infancy in Herrnhut, [[Dresden]] in [[Sachsen]], Germany.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;

== Death and legacy ==
Christian Jacob Protten died in 1769 in Christiansborg, Accra, leaving his wife, Rebecca, widowed for a second time. She had not fully acclimatised to the Gold Coast and the Moravian missionaries contemplated sending her back to Saint Thomas. As she was in poor health, it was decided she remained on the Gold Coast, where she eventually died in 1780, aged 62 years.&lt;ref name=":5" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":7" /&gt;&lt;ref name=":8" /&gt; The appendix to Protten’s booklet was the first published grammar of an indigenous language of the Gold Coast.&lt;ref name=":6" /&gt; His linguistic work in the Ga language predated that of the German philologist and Basel missionary, [[Johannes Zimmermann]] (1825–1876) by a century. Zimmerman also translated the entire [[Bible]] into the Ga language.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=RLZrAAAAIAAJ&amp;q=Hans+Werner+Debrunner&amp;dq=Hans+Werner+Debrunner&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwitlqb19N3bAhURvVMKHVUzC4oQ6AEIJzAA|title=A history of Christianity in Ghana|last=Debrunner|first=Hans Werner|date=1967|publisher=Waterville Pub.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="93394">'''[[Silvio Berlusconi]]''' is an Italian [[media mogul]] and former [[Prime Minister of Italy]] who owns the largest broadcasting company in that country, [[Mediaset]]. His promises to buy off his personal assets to avoid [[conflict of interest|conflicts of interest]] were never fulfilled, which sparked controversy throughout his terms in office. Berlusconi is a controversial figure in modern Italian politics: his tenure as Prime Minister was racked with scandalous sex affairs and poor judgement and decision-making. These events were widely covered by the media, drawing outcry from many of his Italian contemporaries and worldwide counterparts.

==Controversies==

===Economic conflicts of interest===
According to journalists [[Marco Travaglio]] and [[Enzo Biagi]], Berlusconi entered politics to save his companies from bankruptcy and himself from [[conviction (law)|convictions]].&lt;ref name=inciucio&gt;{{Cite book

While investigating these matters, three journalists noted the following facts:
* [[Mediobanca]]'s annual report about the 10 biggest Italian companies showed that, in 1992, Berlusconi's media and finance group [[Fininvest]] had about 7,140&amp;nbsp;billion [[Italian lira|lire]] of [[debt]]s, 8,193&amp;nbsp;billion lire of [[asset]]s (with 35% of liquidity) and a [[net worth]] of 1,053&amp;nbsp;billion lire. The asset-debt ratio represented a patrimonial situation bordering on bankruptcy.{{Citation needed|date=July 2008}}
* Between 1992 and 1993, [[Fininvest]] was investigated several times by [[prosecutor]]s in Milan, Turin and Rome. The investigations regarded: alleged bribes (to political parties and public officials with the aim of getting contracts), alleged fake invoicing by Publitalia, the financing of political congresses and abuse of television frequencies.
* On the other hand, [[Bruno Vespa]] noticed that "In January 1994, Silvio Berlusconi was under no proceedings. Two members of the staff from the Ministry of the Finances were charged to be corrupted for a minor episode by a Fininvest manager, but the accusation would have later fallen. [[Aldo Brancher]], who was working with Fininvest at the time, was charged for having financed some stands at the "[[Festa de l'Unità|Feste dell'Unità]]" and "[[L'Avanti!]]", and he would have been declared fully not guilty only in 2004. [[Paolo Berlusconi]] [Silvio Berlusconi's brother] was instead arrested [...] after the Cavaliere went into politics." After having decided to enter the political arena, Berlusconi was investigated for forty different inquests in less than two years.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Controversy concerning Berlusconi's 'conflicts of interest' are usually centered around the use of his media and marketing power for political gain. However, there is also controversy regarding his financial gains. When RAI was being run by a two-man team appointed by the presidents of the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate (both in Berlusconi's coalition), the state broadcaster increased its viewers, but lost a significant share of its advertising revenue to the rival Mediaset group, owned and run by the Berlusconi family, which has led to large personal gain. {{Citation needed|date=April 2008}}

Berlusconi's governments has passed some laws that have shortened statutory terms for tax fraud. Romano Prodi, who defeated Berlusconi in 2006, claimed that these were ''ad personam laws,'' meant to solve Berlusconi's problems and defend his interests.&lt;ref name="No alle leggi ad personam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2002/08/05/no-alle-leggi-ad-personam.html|title=No alle leggi ad personam|language=Italian|work=la Repubblica|date=5 August 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Intini: no alle leggi ad personam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2003/05/05/intini-no-alle-leggi-ad-personam.html|title=Intini: no alle leggi ad personam|language=Italian|work=la Repubblica|date=5 May 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Via le leggi ad personam"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2006/05/27/via-le-leggi-ad-personam.html|title=Via le leggi ad personam|language=Italian|work=la Repubblica|date=27 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Berlusconi getta la maschera"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.repubblica.it/home_page.php?playmode=player&amp;cont_id=21342&amp;ref=search |title=Berlusconi getta la maschera |language=Italian |publisher=[[Repubblica Radio TV]] |date=17 June 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111003060011/http://tv.repubblica.it/home_page.php?playmode=player&amp;cont_id=21342&amp;ref=search |archivedate=October 3, 2011 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relationship with media===

====Media control and conflict of interest====
Berlusconi's extensive control over the media has been widely criticised by some analysts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hine|first=David|authorlink=David Hine|title=Silvio Berlusconi, i media e il conflitto di interesse|publisher=Il Mulino|year=2002|pages=291–307}}&lt;/ref&gt; some press freedom organisations, and extensively on several Italian newspapers, national and private TV channels by opposition leaders and in general opposition parties members, who allege Italy's media has [[Freedom of the press in Italy|limited freedom of expression]]. However such coverage of the complaint in practice put under discussion the point of the complaint itself. The ''Freedom of the Press 2004 Global Survey'', an annual study issued by the American organisation [[Freedom House]], downgraded Italy's ranking from 'Free' to 'Partly Free'&lt;ref name="Ref_l"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.freedomhouse.org/media/pressrel/042804.htm |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20040503211418/http://www.freedomhouse.org/media/pressrel/042804.htm |archivedate=3 May 2004 |title=Global Press Freedom Deteriorates&amp;nbsp;– Proportion of Global Population With Access to Free Media Plunges to New Low Italy Drops to "Partly Free"}}&lt;/ref&gt; due to Berlusconi's influence over RAI, a ranking which, in "Western Europe" was shared only with Turkey ({{As of|2005|lc=on}}). [[Reporters Without Borders]] states that in 2004, "The conflict of interests involving prime minister Silvio Berlusconi and his vast media empire was still not resolved and continued to threaten news diversity".&lt;ref name="Ref_m"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=10148 |title=Italy&amp;nbsp;– 2004 Annual report |publisher=Reporters Without Borders |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090302045453/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=10148 |archivedate=March 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In April 2004, the [[International Federation of Journalists]] joined the criticism, objecting to the passage of a law vetoed by [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]] in 2003, which critics believe is designed to protect Berlusconi's reported 90% control of the Italian national media.&lt;ref name="strangle"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ifj-europe.org/default.asp?index=2451&amp;Language=EN |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20040927133724/http://www.ifj-europe.org/default.asp?index=2451&amp;Language=EN |archivedate=27 September 2004 |title=Journalists In New Protest as Berlusconi's Grip on Italian Media Becomes A Stranglehold}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlusconi owns via [[Mediaset]] 3 of 7 national TV channels: ([[Canale 5]], [[Italia 1]], and [[Rete 4]]). To better understand the controversies over a conflict of interest between Berlusconi's personal business empire and his political office, it is necessary to look at the structure of governmental control over State television.{{According to whom|date=November 2011}} Under the law, the Speakers of the two Houses appoint the [[RAI]] president and board of directors. In practice, the decision is a political one, generally resulting in some opposition representatives becoming directors, while top managerial posts go to people sympathetic to the government. It was normal to have two directors and the president belonging to the parliamentary majority, and two directors who are opposition supporters. A parliamentary supervisory commission also exists, whose president is traditionally a member of the opposition. During the tenure of Mr. Baldassarre as RAI president, the two opposition directors and the one closer to the [[Union of Christian and Centre Democrats]] left over internal disagreements that mainly regarded censorship issues. RAI continued to be run by a two-man team (mockingly nicknamed by the opposition ''the Japanese'' after the [[Japanese holdout|Japanese soldiers who kept fighting on]] in the Pacific Ocean after the end of World War II).{{citation needed|date=November 2011}}

The former Italian center-left coalition of [[Romano Prodi]] was often criticised for failing to pass a law to regulate the potential ''conflict of interest'' that might arise between media ownership and the holding of political office, despite having governed Italy for an entire legislature from 1996 to 2001. In 2002, [[Luciano Violante]], a prominent member of the Left, said in a speech in [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy|Parliament]]: "Honourable Anedda, I invite you to ask the honourable Berlusconi, because he certainly knows that he received a full guarantee in 1994, when the government changed—that TV stations would not be touched. He knows it and the Honourable [[Gianni Letta|Letta]] knows it."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;[[Luciano Violante]] addressing the [[Chamber of Deputies of Italy]], 28 February 2002)&lt;/ref&gt;{{Verify source|date=October 2009}}

The authors of the book ''Inciucio''&lt;ref&gt;{{it icon}} ''Inciucio''. (Peter Gomez and Marco Travaglio, 2005, [[RCS MediaGroup]], {{ISBN|88-17-01020-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; cite this sentence as evidence for the idea that the Left made a deal with Berlusconi in 1994, in which a promise was made not to honour a law in the [[Constitutional Court of Italy]] that would have required Berlusconi to give up one of his three TV channels in order to uphold pluralism and competition. According to the authors, this would be an explanation of why the Left, despite having won the 1996 elections, did not pass a law to solve the conflicts of interest between media ownership and politics.

Berlusconi's influence over RAI became evident when in [[Sofia, Bulgaria]] he expressed his views on journalists [[Enzo Biagi]] and [[Michele Santoro]],&lt;ref name="Ref_2002c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=3284 |title=Media pluralism more threatened than ever |publisher=Reporters Without Borders |date=6 August 2002 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205145217/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=3284 |archivedate=December 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; and comedian [[Daniele Luttazzi]]. Berlusconi said that they "use television as a criminal means of communication". They lost their jobs as a result.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Gomez|first1=Peter|last2=Travaglio|first2=Marco|authorlink2=Marco Travaglio|title=Regime|publisher=RCS MediaGroup|year=2004|location=Milan|pages=28–258}}&lt;/ref&gt; This statement was called by critics "''[[Editto Bulgaro]]''".

The TV broadcasting of a satirical programme called ''RAIot'' was censored in November 2003 after the comedian [[Sabina Guzzanti]] made outspoken criticism of the Berlusconi media empire.&lt;ref name="Ref_2003"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=8587 |title=RAI suspends satirical programme after lawsuit by Berlusconi-owned company |publisher=Reporters Without Borders |date=22 November 2003 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071205152755/http://www.rsf.org/article.php3?id_article=8587 |archivedate=December 5, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mediaset, one of Berlusconi's companies, sued RAI over Guzzanti's program, demanding 20&amp;nbsp;million euros for "damages"; in November 2003 the show was cancelled by the president of RAI, Lucia Annunziata. The details of the event were made into a [[Michael Moore]]-style documentary called ''[[Viva Zapatero!]]'', which was produced by Guzzanti.

Mediaset, Berlusconi's television group, has stated that it uses the same criteria as the public (state-owned) television [[RAI]] in assigning a proper visibility to all the most important political parties and movements (the so-called 'Par Condicio')&amp;nbsp;– which has been since often disproved.&lt;ref name="Ref_2006"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2006/02/15/le-trappole-della-par-condicio.html|title=Le trappole della par condicio|work=la Repubblica|language=Italian|date=15 February 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_2002d"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2002/05/09/il-bavaglio-del-polo-alla-rai.html|title=Il Bavaglio Del Polo Alla Rai|work=la Repubblica|language=Italian|date=9 May 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2006, on the television channel [[Rai Tre]], in a television interview with [[Lucia Annunziata]] during his talk show, ''[[In 1/2 h]]'', he stormed out of the studio because of a disagreement with the host journalist regarding the economic consequences of his government.&lt;ref name="Ref_2006a"&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/03/12/world/europe/12iht-italy-5839062.html|title=Berlusconi walks off show after a testy exchange |work=International Herald Tribune |date=12 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; In November 2007, allegations of news manipulation caused the departure from RAI of Berlusconi's personal assistant.&lt;ref name="Stille2008"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article5188289.ece|title=Silvio Berlusconi: Yes, yes, yes, Prime Minister|work=The New Yorker /[[The Times]]|date=23 November 2008|location=London|first=Alexander|last=Stille|accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Enrico Mentana]], the news anchor long seen as a guarantor of Canale 5’s independence, walked out in April 2008, saying that he no longer felt “at home in a group that seems like an electoral (campaign) committee”&lt;ref name="Ref_2008d"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.economist.com/world/europe/displaystory.cfm?story_id=14560942|title=Muzzling the messengers|work=The Economist |date=1 October 2008| accessdate=12 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 24 June 2009, Silvio Berlusconi during the [[Confindustria]] young members congress in [[Santa Margherita Ligure|Santa Margherita Ligure, Italy]] has invited the advertisers to interrupt or boycott the advertising contracts with the magazines and newspapers published by [[Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso]],&lt;ref name="reuters-0624"/&gt; in particular the ''[[la Repubblica]]'' and the newsmagazine ''[[L'espresso]]'', calling the publishing group "shameless",&lt;ref name="reuters-0624"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.reuters.com/article/rbssTechMediaTelecomNews/idUSLO59656320090624|title=L'Espresso calls in lawyers on Berlusconi remarks|publisher=Reuters|date=24 June 2009|accessdate=25 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; because is fueling the economic crisis speaking more and more about it and accusing also to make a subversive attack against him to replace with an "un-elected".&lt;ref name="ansa-0624"/&gt; The publishing group has announced to begin legal proceedings against Berlusconi, to protect the image and the interests of the group.&lt;ref name="ansa-0624"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.it/site/notizie/awnplus/english/news/2009-06-24_124359124.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090626195319/http://www.ansa.it/site/notizie/awnplus/english/news/2009-06-24_124359124.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=26 June 2009|title=Espresso group to sue Berlusconi|work=[[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]]|date=24 June 2009|accessdate=25 June 2009}} &lt;/ref&gt;

On 12 October 2009, Silvio Berlusconi during the [[Confindustria]] [[Province of Monza and Brianza|Monza and Brianza]] members congress, has again invited the industrialists present to a "widespread rebellion" against a "newspaper that hadn't any limits in discrediting the government and the country and indoctrinating foreign newspapers".&lt;ref name="larepubblica-1012"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2009/10/sezioni/politica/giustizia-13/marcegaglia-berlusconi/marcegaglia-berlusconi.html|title=Berlusconi contro Repubblica "Ribellatevi ai giornali anti-italiani"|language=Italian|work=la Repubblica|date=12 October 2009|accessdate=13 October 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, [[Reporters Without Borders]] secretary-general [[:fr:Jean-François Julliard (Reporters sans frontières)|Jean-François Julliard]] declared that Berlusconi "is on the verge of being added to our list of Predators of Press Freedom", which would be a first for a European leader. He also added that Italy will probably be ranked last in the European Union in the upcoming edition of the RWB [[Reporters Without Borders#Worldwide Press Freedom Index|press freedom index]].&lt;ref name="Ref_n"&gt;{{cite web|title=Reporters Without Borders in Rome as Berlusconi gets closer to being declared a "Predator" |url=http://www.rsf.org/spip.php?page=article&amp;id_article=34640 |publisher=[[Reporters Without Borders]] |date= |accessdate=3 October 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100201151726/http://www.rsf.org/spip.php?page=article |archivedate=February 1, 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====''The Economist''====
One of Berlusconi's strongest critics in the media outside Italy is the British weekly ''[[The Economist]]'' (nicknamed by Berlusconi ''"The Ecommunist"''), which in its issue of 26 April 2001 carried a title on its front cover, 'Why Silvio Berlusconi is unfit to lead Italy'.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book

Berlusconi claimed the article contained "a series of old accusations" that was an "insult to truth and intelligence".

According to ''The Economist'''s findings, Berlusconi, while Prime Minister of Italy, retained effective control of 90% of all national television broadcasting. This figure included stations he owns directly as well as those over which he had indirect control by dint of his position as Prime Minister and his ability to influence the choice of the management bodies of these stations. ''The Economist'' has also claimed that the Italian Prime Minister is corrupt and self-serving. A key journalist for ''The Economist'', David Lane, has set out many of these charges in his book ''Berlusconi's Shadow''.&lt;ref name="shadow"&gt;{{Cite book

 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Lane points out that Berlusconi has not defended himself in court against the main charges, but has relied upon political and legal manipulations, most notably by changing the statute of limitation to prevent charges being completed in the first place. In order to publicly prove the truth of the documented accusations contained in their articles, the newspaper has publicly challenged Berlusconi to sue ''The Economist'' for libel. Berlusconi did so,&lt;ref name="Ref_k"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/media/pdf/20080905122118632.pdf |title=Document from the Milan court of justice |format=PDF |date= |accessdate=2 March 2010 |work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt; losing versus ''The Economist'', and being charged for all the trial costs on 5 September 2008, when the Court in Milan issued a judgment rejecting all Mr Berlusconi's claims and sentenced him to compensate for legal expenses.

In June 2011, ''The Economist'' published a strong article dealing with Mr. Berlusconi, titled "The Man who screwed an entire country".&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.economist.com/node/18805327 |title= The man who screwed an entire country|date= |accessdate=2 March 2010 |work=The Economist}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Friendship with Bettino Craxi===
Berlusconi's career as an entrepreneur is also often questioned by his detractors. The allegations made against him generally include suspicions about the extremely fast increase of his activity as a construction entrepreneur in years 1961–63, hinting at the possibility that in those years he received money from unknown and possibly illegal sources. These accusations are regarded by Berlusconi and his supporters as empty [[slander]], trying to undermine Berlusconi's reputation as a self-made man. Also frequently cited by opponents are events dating to the 1980s, including supposed "favour exchanges" between Berlusconi and [[Bettino Craxi]], the former Socialist prime minister and leader of the [[Italian Socialist Party]] convicted in 1994 for various corruption charges. The Milan magistrates who indicted and successfully convicted Mr. Craxi in their "[[Mani pulite|Clean Hands]]" investigation laid bare an entrenched system in which businessmen paid hundreds of millions of dollars to political parties or individual politicians in exchange for sweetheart deals with Italian state companies and the government itself.&lt;ref name="Friedman2000"&gt;{{Cite news|work=The New York Times |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/01/20/news/20iht-obit.2.t_32.html?scp=2&amp;sq=craxi&amp;st=cse |title=Bettino Craxi, Italian Socialist Leader, Dies in Tunisiader |date=20 January 2000|accessdate=11 November 2009 | first=Alan | last=Friedman}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlusconi acknowledges a personal friendship with Craxi.

===Legislative changes===
On some occasions, which raised a strong upheaval in the Italian political opposition, laws passed by the Berlusconi administration have effectively delayed ongoing trials on him. Relevant examples are the law reducing punishment for all cases of false accounting and the law on ''legitimate suspicion'', which allowed defendants to request their cases to be moved to another court if they believe that the local judges are biased against them.&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|7]], [[#References|8]]&lt;/sup&gt; Because of these legislative actions, political opponents accuse Berlusconi of passing these laws for the purpose of protecting himself from legal charges. An enquiry realised by the newspaper ''La Repubblica'' sustained that Berlusconi passed 17 different laws which have advantaged himself;&lt;ref name="Ref_2009f"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2009/11/sezioni/politica/giustizia-18/inchiesta-davanzo/inchiesta-davanzo.html |title=Per Silvio Berlusconi 18 salvacondotti in 15 anni |language=Italian |work=la Repubblica |date=23 November 2009 |accessdate=2 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlusconi and his allies, on the other hand, maintain that such laws are consistent with everyone's right to a rapid and just trial, and with the principle of ''presumption of innocence'' (guarantism); furthermore, they claim that Berlusconi is being subjected to a political "witch hunt", orchestrated by certain (allegedly left-wing) judges&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|11]]&lt;/sup&gt;.

For such reasons, Berlusconi and his government have an ongoing quarrel with the Italian judiciary, which reached its peak in 2003 when Berlusconi commented to a foreign journalist that judges are "mentally disturbed" and "anthropologically different from the rest of the human race", remarks that he later claimed he meant to be directed to specific judges only, and of a humorous nature&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|12]]&lt;/sup&gt;. More seriously, the Berlusconi administration has long been planning a judiciary reform intended to limit the flexibility currently enjoyed by judges and magistrates in their decision-making, but which, according to its critics, will instead limit the magistrature's independence, by ''de facto'' subjecting the judiciary to the executive's control. This reform has met almost unanimous dissent from the Italian judges&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|13]], [[#References|14]]&lt;/sup&gt; and, after three years of debate and struggle, was passed by the Italian parliament in December 2004, but was immediately vetoed by the Italian President, [[Carlo Azeglio Ciampi]] &lt;sup&gt;[[#References|15]]&lt;/sup&gt;, because of the unconstitutionality of some of the passed laws.

Berlusconi has also been indicted in Spain for charges of tax fraud and violation of anti-trust laws regarding the private television network [[Telecinco]], but his status as a member of the European Parliament allowed him to gain immunity from prosecution until 2005.&lt;sup&gt;[[#References|16]]&lt;/sup&gt;
All the accused have been [[acquittal|acquitted]] by the Spanish [[Supreme Court of Spain|Supreme Court]] in July 2008.&lt;ref name="Ref_e"&gt;[http://www.ansa.it/ansalatina/notizie/rubriche/italia/20080724222034698613.html]{{dead link|date=August 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_f"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/notizie/rubriche/daassociare/visualizza_new.html_730968525.html |accessdate=November 14, 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080805125339/http://www.ansa.it/opencms/export/site/notizie/rubriche/daassociare/visualizza_new.html_730968525.html |archivedate=August 5, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the night hours between 5 and 6 March 2010, the Berlusconi-led Italian government passed a decree ''interpreting'' the electoral law so as to let the PDL candidate run for governor in Lazio after she had failed to properly register for the elections. The Italian Constitution states that electoral procedures can only be changed in Parliament, and must not be changed by governmental decree. Italy's President, whose endorsement of the decree was required by law, said amid much controversy that the measure taken by the government may not violate the Constitution.&lt;ref name="Ref_2010b"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/news/international/Italy_opposition_protest_for_second_day_over_decree.html?cid=8432170 |title=Italy opposition protest for second day over decree |date=7 March 2010 |work=[[swissinfo]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511210247/http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/news/international/Italy_opposition_protest_for_second_day_over_decree.html?cid=8432170 |archivedate=2011-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_2010c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/news/international/Italy_opposition_protests_at_ballot_decree.html?cid=8428120 |title=Italy opposition protests at ballot decree |date=6 March 2010 |work=[[swissinfo]] |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110511210254/http://www.swissinfo.ch/eng/news/international/Italy_opposition_protests_at_ballot_decree.html?cid=8428120 |archivedate=2011-05-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Silvio Berlusconi has never been tried on charges relating to ''[[Cosa Nostra]]'', although several Mafia turncoats have stated that Berlusconi had connections with the Sicilian criminal association. The claims arise mostly from the hiring of [[Vittorio Mangano]], charged for Mafia association, as a gardener and stable-man at Berlusconi's Villa San Martino in [[Arcore]], a small town near Milan. It was Berlusconi's friend [[Marcello Dell'Utri]] who introduced Mangano to Berlusconi in 1973.&lt;ref name=eco260401&gt;[http://www.economist.com/world/displaystory.cfm?story_id=587107 An Italian Story], The Economist, 26 April 2001&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=bbc080103&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/2638609.stm Berlusconi accused of Mafia links], BBC News, 8 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Berlusconi denied any ties to the Mafia. Marcello Dell'Utri even stated that the Mafia did not exist at all.

In 2004 Dell'Utri, co-founder of [[Forza Italia]], was sentenced to nine years by a [[Palermo]] court on charge of "external association to the Mafia",&lt;ref name=bbc080103/&gt;&lt;ref name=rep111204&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2004/l/sezioni/politica/dellutri/dellusentenza/dellusentenza.html|title=Accusa e difesa del senatore "M" Una vicenda lunga dieci anni|language=Italian|work=la Repubblica|date=11 December 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; a sentence describing Dell'Utri as a mediator between the economical interests of Berlusconi and members of the criminal organisation.

In 2010, Palermo's appeals court cut the sentence to seven years but fully confirmed Dell'Utri's role as a link between Berlusconi and the mafia until 1992.&lt;ref name=reu191110&gt;[http://uk.reuters.com/article/idUKTRE6AI5D120101119 UK.reuters.com], Reuters UK, 19 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1996, a Mafia informer, [[Salvatore Cancemi]], declared that Berlusconi and Dell'Utri were in direct contact with [[Salvatore Riina]], head of the [[Sicilian Mafia]] in the 1980s and 90s. Cancemi disclosed that Fininvest, through Marcello Dell'Utri and mafioso [[Vittorio Mangano]], had paid Cosa Nostra 200&amp;nbsp;million lire (between 100 000 and 200 000 of today's euro) annually. The alleged contacts, according to Cancemi, were to lead to legislation favourable to Cosa Nostra, in particular the harsh 41-bis prison regime. The underlying premise was that Cosa Nostra would support Berlusconi's Forza Italia party in return for political favours.&lt;ref name=gua100501&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/Archive/Article/0,4273,4183973,00.html Berlusconi friend on trial for 'aiding Mafia'], ''The Guardian'', 10 May 2001&lt;/ref&gt; After a two-year investigation, magistrates closed the inquiry without charges. They did not find evidence to corroborate Cancemi’s allegations. Similarly, a two-year investigation, also launched on evidence from Cancemi, into Berlusconi’s alleged association with the Mafia was closed in 1996.&lt;ref name=eco260401/&gt;

According to yet another [[pentito|Mafia turncoat]], [[Antonino Giuffrè]]&amp;nbsp;– arrested on 16 April 2002&amp;nbsp;– the Mafia turned to Berlusconi's [[Forza Italia]] party to look after the Mafia's interests, after the decline in the early 1990s of the ruling [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]] party, whose leaders in Sicily looked after the Mafia's interests in Rome. The Mafia's fall out with the Christian Democrats became clear when [[Salvo Lima]] was killed in March 1992. "The Lima murder marked the end of an era," Giuffrè told the court. "A new era opened with a new political force on the horizon which provided the guarantees that the Christian Democrats were no longer able to deliver. To be clear, that party was Forza Italia."&lt;ref name=gua080103&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jan/08/italy.philipwillan|title=Berlusconi aide 'struck deal with mafia'|work=The Guardian |date=8 January 2003 | location=London | first=Philip | last=Willan | accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dell'Utri was the go-between on a range of legislative efforts to ease pressure on mafiosi in exchange for electoral support, according to Giuffrè. "Dell'Utri was very close to Cosa Nostra and a very good contact point for Berlusconi," he said.&lt;ref name=obs120103&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/jan/12/italy.philipwillan Mafia supergrass fingers Berlusconi], ''The Observer'', 12 January 2003&lt;/ref&gt; Mafia boss [[Bernardo Provenzano]] told Giuffrè that they "were in good hands" with Dell'Utri, who was a "serious and trustworthy person". Provenzano stated that the Mafia's judicial problems would be resolved within 10 years after 1992, thanks to the undertakings given by Forza Italia.&lt;ref name=bbc080103/&gt;&lt;ref name=gua080103/&gt;

Giuffrè also said that Berlusconi himself used to be in touch with [[Stefano Bontade]], a top Mafia boss, in the mid 1970s. At the time Berlusconi still was just a wealthy real estate developer and started his private television empire. Bontade visited Berlusconi's villa in [[Arcore]] through his contact [[Vittorio Mangano]].&lt;ref name="guardian05122002"/&gt; Berlusconi's lawyer dismissed Giuffrè's testimony as "false" and an attempt to discredit the Prime Minister and his party. Giuffrè said that other Mafia representatives who were in contact with Berlusconi included the Palermo Mafia bosses Filippo Graviano and [[Giuseppe Graviano]].&lt;ref name="Ref_2002a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/cronaca/giuffredue/verbale/verbale.html|title=Giuffré: il boss Graviano era il tramite con Berlusconi|language=Italian|work=la Repubblica|date=3 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Graviano brothers allegedly treated directly with Berlusconi through the business-man [[Gianni Letta]], somewhere between September/October 1993. The alleged pact with the Mafia fell apart in 2002. Cosa Nostra had achieved nothing.&lt;ref name="Ref_2002b"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/online/cronaca/giuffredue/patto/patto.html|title=Giuffrè, gli obiettivi della confessione|language=Italian|work=la Repubblica|date=4 December 2002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Dell'Utri's lawyer, Enrico Trantino, dismissed Giuffrè’s allegations as an "anthology of hearsay". He said Giuffrè had perpetuated the trend that every new turncoat would attack Dell'Utri and the former [[Christian Democracy (Italy)|Christian Democrat]] prime minister [[Giulio Andreotti]] in order to earn money and judicial privileges.&lt;ref name="guardian05122002"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2002/dec/05/italy.philipwillan|title=Berlusconi implicated in deal with godfathers|work=The Guardian |date=5 December 2002 | location=London | first=Philip | last=Willan | accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2009, [[Gaspare Spatuzza]], a Mafioso turned pentito in 2008, has confirmed Giuffrè statements. Spatuzza testified that his boss Giuseppe Graviano had told him in 1994 that Berlusconi was bargaining with the Mafia, concerning a political-electoral agreement between Cosa Nostra and Berlusconi’s Forza Italia. Spatuzza said Graviano disclosed the information to him during a conversation in a bar Graviano owned in the upscale Via Veneto district of the Italian capital Rome. Dell'Utri was the intermediary, according to Spatuzza. Dell'Utri has dismissed Spatuzza's allegations as "nonsense". Berlusconi’s lawyer and MP for the PdL, [[Niccolò Ghedini]] said that "the statements given by Spatuzza about prime minister Berlusconi are baseless and can be in no way verified."&lt;ref name=aki231009&gt;[http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/Politics/?id=3.0.3909367513 Lawyer rejects turncoat's claims linking Berlusconi to mafia], Adnkronos International, 23 October 2009&lt;/ref&gt;

===Foreign relations===

====Russia====
[[File:Vladimir Putin 28 May 2002-14.jpg|thumb|right|Berlusconi and [[Vladimir Putin]].]]

Berlusconi has a warm relationship with [[Vladimir Putin]].&lt;ref name="Ref_2008c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/europe/0,1518,583212,00.html|title=The Silvio Show: Berlusconi's Extended Honeymoon|work=Der Spiegel |date=10 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2007 Italy’s state-owned energy company [[Eni]] signed an agreement with Russian state-owned [[Gazprom]] to build the [[South Stream]] pipeline.&lt;ref name="hexagon"/&gt; Investigating Italian parliament members discovered that [[Central Energy Italian Gas Holding]] (CEIGH), a part of the [[Centrex Group]], was to play a major role in the lucrative agreement. [[Bruno Mentasti-Granelli]], a close friend of Berlusconi, owned 33 percent of CEIGH. Italian parliament blocked the contract and accused Berlusconi of having a personal interest in the Eni-Gazprom agreement.&lt;ref name="hexagon"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=34194|title=Berlusconi, Centrex, Hexagon 1 and 2 and Gazprom|publisher=[[The Jamestown Foundation]]|date=1 December 2008|access-date=2011-11-14|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920/http://www.jamestown.org/single/?no_cache=1&amp;tx_ttnews%5Btt_news%5D=34194#|archive-date=2012-09-20|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_h"&gt;[http://www.kommersant.com/page.asp?id=636565 The Putin and Pals Project] {{Webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120920/http://www.kommersant.com/page.asp?id=636565# |date=2012-09-20 }}. Kommersant. 24 December 2005&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 December 2010, Wikileaks leaked American state diplomatic cables showing that American officials voiced concerns over Berlusconi's extraordinary closeness to Putin, "including 'lavish gifts,' lucrative energy contracts and a 'shadowy' Russian-speaking Italian go-between". Diplomats consider him "to be the mouthpiece of Putin" in Europe.&lt;ref name="nyt_cables_2"&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2010/11/29/world/29cables.html?pagewanted=2 Cables Obtained by WikiLeaks Shine Light Into Secret Diplomatic Channels&amp;nbsp;– Page 1]; New York Times. Retrieved 28 November 2010.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to one of the leaked cables the Georgian ambassador in Rome has told to the American officials that Georgia believes Putin has promised Berlusconi a percentage of profits from any pipelines developed by [[Gazprom]] in coordination with [[Eni S.p.A.]].&lt;ref name="Ref_i"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://213.251.145.96/cable/2009/01/09ROME97.html# |title=Viewing cable 09ROME97, Italy-Russia elations: the view from Rome |access-date=2011-11-14 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101206132718/http://213.251.145.96/cable/2009/01/09ROME97.html# |archive-date=2010-12-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Belarus====
Berlusconi visited [[Belarus]] and met its authoritarian president [[Alexander Lukashenko]] in 2009. Berlusconi became the first Western leader to visit Lukashenko since the latter came to power in 1994. In the press conference Berlusconi paid compliments to Lukashenko and said "Good luck to you and your people, whom I know love you".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/belarus-italy.1pq |title=Italy's Berlusconi visit ends Belarus isolation |publisher=EUbusiness |accessdate=22 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120402042242/http://www.eubusiness.com/news-eu/belarus-italy.1pq |archivedate=2 April 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Disputed Belarus Vote Shows ‘Love’ for Leader, Berlusconi Says |publisher=Bloomberg |date=30 November 2009 |url=https://www.bloomberg.com/apps/news?pid=newsarchive&amp;sid=aeTaYgPv3vAE}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Libya====
During much of Berlusconi's government Italy gradually reconciled with [[Libya]] of [[Muammar Gaddafi]]. Italy gets a quarter of its [[Petroleum|oil]] and about 10% of its [[Natural gas|gas]] from Libya, and enterprises from both countries have strong interests in the other economy. Berlusconi's [[Call girl|escort girls]] helped Gaddafi to gain the leadership of the [[African Union]] in 2009.&lt;ref&gt;"[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/silvio-berlusconi/8364768/Berlusconi-sent-escorts-to-Gaddafi-opponent-as-favour-to-Libya-leader.html Berlusconi 'sent escorts to Gaddafi opponent as favour to Libya leader']". Telegraph. 6 March 2011&lt;/ref&gt; During the first days of the [[2011 Libyan civil war]] Berlusconi was initially cautious, painting Libya not as a military priority but a humanitarian one. In the following days the Italian government condemned the use of violence and suspended the friendship treaty with Libya signed in 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-12612405 |title=Italy and Silvio Berlusconi face Libya dilemma |date=1 March 2011 | publisher=BBC}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Remarks on Western civilisation and Islam===
After the [[11 September 2001 attacks]] in [[New York City|New York]], Berlusconi said: "We must be aware of the superiority of our civilisation, a system that has guaranteed well-being, respect for human rights and&amp;nbsp;– in contrast with Islamic countries&amp;nbsp;– respect for religious and political rights, a system that has as its value understanding of diversity and tolerance."&lt;ref name="Ref_2001b"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/storm-over-berlusconi--inferior-muslims-remarks-670971.html|title=Storm over Berlusconi 'inferior Muslims' remarks|work=The Independent |location=UK|date=27 September 2001 | accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_2001c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wsws.org/articles/2001/sep2001/ital-s29.shtml|title=Racist vomit from Italy’s PM Berlusconi|work=[[World Socialist Web Site|WSWS]]|date=29 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; This declaration caused an uproar, not only in the Arab and Muslim world, but also all around Europe, including Italy.&lt;ref name="bbc-berlu-islam"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/middle_east/1565664.stm|title=EU deplores 'dangerous' Islam jibe|publisher=BBC News|date=27 September 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt; Subsequently Berlusconi told the press: "We are aware of the crucial role of moderate Arab countries... I am sorry that words that have been misunderstood have offended the sensitivity of my Arab and Muslim friends."&lt;ref name="Henneberger2001"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2001/09/29/world/berlusconi-stands-by-remarks-on-islam.html|title=Berlusconi Stands By Remarks on Islam|work=New York Times |date=29 September 2001 | first=Melinda | last=Henneberger | accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Right-to-die case===
After the family of [[Eluana Englaro]] (who had been comatose for 17 years) succeeded in having her [[right to die]] recognised by the judges and getting doctors to start the process of allowing her to die in the way established by the court, Berlusconi issued a decree to stop the doctor from letting her die. Stating that, "This is murder. I would be failing to rescue her. I'm not a [[Pontius Pilate]]", Berlusconi went on to defend his decision by claiming that she was "in the condition to have babies",&lt;ref name="Day2008"&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/feb/08/englaro-italy-vatican |work=Guardian |title=Italy faces constitutional crisis over coma woman |date=8 February 2008 | location=London | accessdate=30 March 2010 | first=Michael | last=Day}}&lt;/ref&gt; arguing that comatose women were still subject to [[menstruation]].
Critics said that this controversial move had been staged to repair relations with the Vatican, following harsh criticism of the treatment of immigrants by the Berlusconi administration.{{citation needed|date=April 2011}}

===Jokes, gestures, and blunders===
[[File:Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva and Silvio Berlusconi 20080709.jpg|thumb|right|Berlusconi with the President of Brazil [[Luiz Inácio Lula da Silva]]]]

Berlusconi has developed a reputation for making gaffes or insensitive remarks.&lt;ref name=Insensitive&gt;{{cite news|title=Editorial: Touched by Crassness|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/comment/leading_article/article6062638.ece|work=The Times|accessdate=4 October 2011|location=London|first=Mal|last=Siret}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 2 July 2003, Berlusconi suggested that German [[Social Democratic Party of Germany|SPD]] [[Member of the European Parliament|MEP]] [[Martin Schulz]], who had criticised his domestic policies, should play a [[Nazi]] [[concentration camp]] [[Kapo (Arbeitslager)|guard]] in a film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3037386.stm |title=Berlusconi in EU 'Nazi' slur |publisher=BBC News |date=2 July 2003 |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlusconi insisted that he was joking, but accused Schulz and others to be "bad-willing tourists of democracy". This incident caused a brief cooling of Italy's relationship with Germany.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2003/07/03/berlusconi-lite-strasburgo.html|title=Berlusconi, lite a Strasburgo|work=la Repubblica|language=Italian|date=3 July 2003|accessdate=30 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Addressing traders at the [[New York Stock Exchange]] in September 2003, Berlusconi listed a series of reasons to invest in Italy, the first of which was that "we have the most beautiful secretaries in the world". This remark resulted in uproar in Italy where female members of parliament took part in a one-day cross-party protest.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/3137406.stm |title=Berlusconi vaunts Italy's secretaries |publisher=BBC News |date=24 September 2003 | accessdate=2 September 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Berlusconi's list also included the claim that Italy had "fewer communists, and those who are still here deny having been one".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/5106644/Silvio-Berlusconis-top-10-gaffes-and-pranks.html |title=Silvio Berlusconi's top 10 gaffes and pranks |work=The Daily Telegraph |location=UK |date=4 April 2009 | accessdate=2 September 2011 |first=Nick |last=Squires}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, during an interview with Nicholas Farrell, then editor of ''[[The Spectator]]'', Berlusconi claimed that [[Benito Mussolini|Mussolini]] "had been a benign dictator who did not murder opponents but sent them 'on holiday'".&lt;ref name="Owen2008"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article3746319.ece|title=Profile: the irrepressible Silvio Berlusconi|work=The Times |date=14 April 2008|accessdate=16 April 2008 | location=London | first=Richard | last=Owen}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kotipizza Berlusconi.JPG|thumb|left|upright|[[Kotipizza]] ''Pizza Berlusconi'']]
Berlusconi had made disparaging remarks about [[Finland|Finnish]] cuisine during negotiations to decide on the location of the [[European Food Safety Authority]] in 2001. He caused further offence in 2005, when he claimed that during the negotiations he had had to "dust off his playboy charms" in order to persuade the Finnish president, [[Tarja Halonen]], to concede that the EFSA should be based in [[Parma]] instead of Finland, and compared Finnish smoked [[reindeer]] unfavourably to [[culatello]]. The Italian [[ambassador]] in [[Helsinki]] was summoned by the Finnish foreign minister.&lt;ref name="Ref_2005a"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4122596.stm|title='Playboy' Berlusconi irks Finland |publisher=BBC News|date=23 June 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; One of Berlusconi's ministers later 'explained' the comment by saying that "anyone who had seen a picture of Halonen must have been aware that he had been joking". Halonen took the incident in good humour, retorting that Berlusconi had "overestimated his persuasion skills".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://yle.fi/uutiset/news/2010/09/halonen_and_berlusconi_meet_in_rome_1965672.html| title=Halonen and Berlusconi meet in Rome |date=8 September 2010 |publisher=YLE.fi}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Finnish pizza chain [[Kotipizza]] responded by launching a variety of pizza called ''Pizza Berlusconi'', using smoked reindeer as the topping. The pizza won first prize in America's Plate International pizza contest in March 2008.&lt;ref name="Ref_t"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.kotipizza.fi/Suomeksi/Menu/Pizzat |title=Menu of Kotipizza pizza chain, note the Berlusconi pizza |publisher=Kotipizza.fi |date= |accessdate=2 March 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081217031359/http://www.kotipizza.fi/Suomeksi/Menu/Pizzat |archivedate=December 17, 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_u"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.care2.com/news/go/671026 |accessdate=November 14, 2011 }}{{dead link|date=June 2016|bot=medic}}{{cbignore|bot=medic}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 2006, Berlusconi alleged that Chinese communists under [[Mao Zedong]] had "boiled [children] to fertilise the fields".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2002896399_babies29.html |title=Chinese angered by Italian premier's allegation that country boiled babies |author=Maria Sanminiatelli |publisher=Seattle Times |date=29 March 2006 |accessdate=24 June 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131005010136/http://seattletimes.com/html/nationworld/2002896399_babies29.html |archivedate=5 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; His opponent [[Romano Prodi]] criticised Berlusconi for offending the Chinese people and called his comments 'unthinkable'.&lt;ref name="Ref_2006b"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/4857226.stm|title=Berlusconi baby gaffe riles China|publisher=BBC News|date=29 March 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the run-up to the [[Italian general election, 2008|2008 Italian general election]], Berlusconi was angrily accused of [[sexism]] for saying that female politicians from the right were "more beautiful" and that "the left has no taste, even when it comes to women".&lt;ref name="Ref_2008e"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/7338415.stm|title=Berlusconi: Left has uglier women|publisher=BBC News|date=9 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2008 Berlusconi criticised the composition of the Council of Ministers of the [[Spanish Government]] as being too 'pink' by virtue of the fact that it has (once the President of the Council, [[José Luis Rodríguez Zapatero]], is counted) an equal number of men and women. He also stated that he doubted that such a composition would be possible in Italy given the "prevalence of men" in Italian politics.&lt;ref name="Ref_2008f"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elmundo.es/elmundo/2008/04/15/internacional/1208272351.html|title=Berlusconi 'regaña' a Zapatero: 'Su Gobierno es demasiado rosa'|language=Spanish|work=[[El Mundo (Spain)|El Mundo]]|date=15 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2008 Berlusconi caused controversy at a joint press conference with [[Russia]]n president [[Vladimir Putin]]. When Russian journalist [[Nezavisimaya Gazeta]] asked a question about Mr. Putin's personal relationships, Berlusconi made a gesture towards the journalist imitating a gunman shooting.&lt;ref name="TVG"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=XpNx5-9ZOyQ|title=Berlusconi e Putin in Sardegna&amp;nbsp;— TG3|publisher=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_2008g"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://russiatoday.ru/Top_News/2008-04-20/Berlusconi_to_lobby_EU_on_behalf_of_Russian_travellers.html |title=Berlusconi to lobby EU on behalf of Russian travellers |publisher=[[Russia Today]] |quote=See embedded video |date=20 April 2008 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090627235124/http://russiatoday.ru/Top_News/2008-04-20/Berlusconi_to_lobby_EU_on_behalf_of_Russian_travellers.html |archivedate=2009-06-27 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 6 November 2008, two days after [[Barack Obama]] was elected the first black US President, Berlusconi referred to Obama as "young, handsome and even tanned":&lt;ref name="Ref_v"&gt;{{cite web |title=Berlusconi Obama Suntanned |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ErsgFMFhoPQ |publisher=Repubblica Radio TV |accessdate=22 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Sisto2008"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/worldNews/idUKTRE4A562120081106|title=Italy's Berlusconi hails "suntanned" Obama|publisher=Reuters|date=6 November 2008 | first=Alberto | last=Sisto}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_2008i"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://tv.repubblica.it/copertina/l-abbronzato-fa-il-giro-del-mondo/26102?video|title=L'abbronzato fa il giro del mondo|publisher=Repubblica Radio TV|date=7 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 26 March 2009 he said "I'm paler [than Mr. Obama], because it's been so long since I went sunbathing.

Subsequently, at a tent camp on the outskirts of L'Aquila housing some of the more than 30,000 people who lost their homes during the [[2009 L'Aquila earthquake|2009 earthquake]] he said to an African priest: "you have a nice tan."&lt;ref name="dailymail01"&gt;{{Cite news |title=He's done it AGAIN!

On 24 January 2009, Berlusconi announced his aim to increase the numbers of military patrolling the Italian cities from 3,000 to 30,000 in order to crack down on what he called an "evil army" of criminals. Responding to a female journalist who asked him if this tenfold increase in patrolling soldiers would be enough to secure Italian women from being raped, he said: "We could not field a big enough force to avoid this risk [of rape]. We would need as many soldiers as beautiful women and I don't think that would be possible, because our women are so beautiful." Opposition leaders called the remarks insensitive and in bad taste. Berlusconi retorted that he had merely wanted to compliment Italian women. Other critics accused him of creating a "[[police state]]".&lt;ref name="Squires2009a"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/4339817/Silvio-Berlusconi-criticised-for-pretty-girl-rape-comment.html|title=Silvio Berlusconi criticised for 'pretty girl' rape comment |work=The Daily Telegraph |date=4 April 2009 | location=London | first=Nick | last=Squires | accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 3 April 2009, Berlusconi appeared to have annoyed Queen [[Elizabeth II]] at a photo session during the [[2009 G-20 London summit|G20 summit]]. During the photo session, Berlusconi shouted "Mr. Obama, Mr. Obama", prompting her to turn around and chastise Berlusconi, “What is it? Why does he have to shout?”.&lt;ref name="Ref_2009al"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7980912.stm|title=Queen is not amused by Berlusconi |publisher=BBC News|date=3 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_2009am"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/politics/G20/article6031910.ece|title=Queen shows Silvio Berlusconi how to be a head of state at London summit|work=The Times |location=UK |date=4 April 2009|first=Mal|last=Siret}}&lt;/ref&gt; The following day, at the [[NATO]] meeting in [[Kehl]], Berlusconi was seen talking on his mobile phone, while Merkel and other NATO leaders waited for him for a photo on a [[Rhine]] bridge&lt;ref name="Ref_2009an"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://uk.reuters.com/article/topNews/idUKTRE5330S420090404|title=Berlusconi skips NATO ceremonies to talks to Turkey|publisher=Reuters|date=4 April 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; (afterwards, Berlusconi claimed he was talking to [[Turkey|Turkish]] Prime Minister [[Recep Tayyip Erdoğan]] about accepting the Secretary Generalship of [[Anders Fogh Rasmussen]]). Responding to the Italian media's reaction to these incidents, he said he was considering "hard measures" against reporters, and referred to some of their claims as "slander".&lt;ref name="Nick2009"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/europe/italy/5110631/Silvio-Berlusconi-threatens-news-blackout-after-reports-of-latest-gaffes.html|title=Silvio Berlusconi threatens news blackout after reports of latest gaffes|author=Nick Squires|work=The Daily Telegraph |date=6 April 2009|accessdate=6 April 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Two days after the [[2009 L'Aquila earthquake]], Berlusconi suggested that people left homeless should view their experience as a camping weekend.&lt;ref name="Hooper2009"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/apr/08/italy-earthquake-berlusconi|title=Berlusconi: Italy earthquake victims should view experience as a camping weekend|work=The Guardian |date=8 April 2009|accessdate=8 April 2009 | location=London | first=John | last=Hooper}}&lt;/ref&gt;
While touring the earthquake site, he asked councillor Lia Beltrami, "Can I fondle you?".&lt;ref name="Ref_2009ao"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.thesun.co.uk/sol/homepage/news/article2416229.ece|title=Fondle gaffe for PM Berlusconi|work=The Sun |location=UK |date=7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 2009, Berlusconi alleged that he had once had to travel three hours to see a two-hundred-year-old church in the Finnish countryside which, in his opinion, would have been demolished if it was in Italy. Berlusconi had made a non-official visit to Finland in 1999 and had never seen any Finnish church, but had just been visiting [[Iceland]].&lt;ref name="Ref_2009ap"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hs.fi/english/article/Berlusconi%E2%80%99s+church+comments+met+with+astonishment+in+Finland/1135245796052|title=Berlusconi’s church comments met with astonishment in Finland|publisher=[[Helsingin Sanomat]]|date=9 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_2009aq"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://newsroom.finland.fi/stt/showarticle.asp?intNWSAID=21628&amp;group=General|title=Berlusconi rolls out another Finnish gaffe|publisher=[[Suomen Tietotoimisto]]|date=7 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, Berlusconi was chastised by the Vatican newspaper ''[[L'Osservatore Romano]]'' after he was filmed telling "offensive and deplorable jokes", including one whose punchline was similar to one of the gravest blasphemies in the Italian language. It was also revealed he had made another anti-Semitic joke a few days previously. Berlusconi responded to the allegations by saying the jokes were "neither an offence nor a sin, but merely a laugh".&lt;ref name="Kington2010"&gt;{{Cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2010/oct/03/silvio-berlusconi-under-fire-jokes | location=London | work=The Guardian | first=Tom | last=Kington | title=Silvio Berlusconi condemned by Vatican newspaper for 'deplorable' jokes | date=3 October 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 1 November 2010, after once again being accused of involvement in juvenile prostitution, he suggested that an audience at the Milan trade fair should stop reading newspapers: "Don't read newspapers any more because they deceive you. [...] I am a man who works hard all day long and if sometimes I look at some good-looking girl, it's better to be fond of pretty girls than to be gay".&lt;ref name="Ref_2010f"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=d1RX_ppWuRg|title=Berlusconi and girls|date=1 Nov 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The remarks were immediately condemned by [[Arcigay]], Italy's main [[gay rights]] organisation, on behalf of both women and gay people; speaking on behalf of the organisation, its president Paolo Patanè said that it was "unacceptable for a head of government to foster a chauvinistic and vulgar attitude" with such a statement, and requested that Berlusconi apologise. Politicians including [[Nichi Vendola]], [[Antonio Di Pietro]], and [[Franco Grillini]] released similar statements, with the latter commenting that it was "better to be gay than to be a sex-addicted schemer like Berlusconi."&lt;ref name="Ref_2010g"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.libero-news.it/news/522513/Berlusconi___Meglio_guardare_le_belle_ragazze_che_essere_gay_.html |publisher=Libero |date=2 November 2010 |title=Berlusconi: "Meglio guardare le belle ragazze che essere gay" |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111005062234/http://www.libero-news.it/news/522513/Berlusconi___Meglio_guardare_le_belle_ragazze_che_essere_gay_.html |archivedate=2011-10-05 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Vendola2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pbd_iaGJEa8 |publisher=Youtube |last=Vendola |first=Nichi |date=2 November 2010 |accessdate=4 December 2010 |title=Nichi Vendola&amp;nbsp;– videolettera a Silvio Berlusconi&amp;nbsp;– Il teatro della virilità}}&lt;/ref&gt; Flavia Madaschi, president of Agedo, the Italian equivalent of [[PFLAG]], also commented that it was "better to be gay than Berlusconi."&lt;ref name="Ref_2010h"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://ricerca.repubblica.it/repubblica/archivio/repubblica/2010/11/05/movimenti-militanti-sinistra-in-piazza-si-meglio.html |title=Movimenti, militanti e sinistra in piazza&amp;nbsp;– Sì, meglio essere gay che Berlusconi |publisher=La Repubblica |date=5 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Activists staged an anti-homophobia protest outside [[Palazzo Chigi]].&lt;ref name="Ref_2010i"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/10_novembre_02/reazioni-berlusconi_2145515c-e674-11df-a903-00144f02aabc.shtml |publisher=Corriere della Sera |title=Bersani: "Ruby?

On 13 July 2011, according to a leaked telephone surveillance transcript, Berlusconi told his presumed [[blackmail]]er Valter Lavitola: "The only thing they can say about me is that I screw around [...] Now they're spying on me, controlling my phone calls. I don't give a fuck. In a few months [...] I'll be leaving this shit country that makes me sick."&lt;ref&gt;"a me, l'unica cosa che possono dire di me è che scopo. È chiaro?

===Assault at rally===
On 13 December 2009 Berlusconi was hit in the face with an alabaster&lt;ref name="Ref_2009ar"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Tartaglia interrogato dai pm 'Gesto folle, ma premeditato' | language = Italian | publisher=La Repubblica | date = 15 December 2009 | url = http://www.repubblica.it/2009/12/sezioni/politica/giustizia-22/testimone-nuovo/testimone-nuovo.html }}&lt;/ref&gt; statuette of [[Milan Cathedral]] after a rally in Milan's ''[[Piazza del Duomo, Milan|Piazza del Duomo]]''. As Berlusconi was shaking hands with the public, a man in the crowd stepped forward and launched the statuette at him. The assailant was subsequently detained and identified as Massimo Tartaglia, a 42-year-old surveyor with a history of mental illness but no criminal record, living in the outskirts of Milan.&lt;ref name="Ref_2009as"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Da perito a inventore, è in cura da dieci anni | language = Italian | publisher="[[Corriere della Sera]]'' | date = 14 December 2009 | page = 4 | url = http://archiviostorico.corriere.it/2009/dicembre/14/perito_inventore_cura_dieci_anni_co_8_091214010.shtml | accessdate =4 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_2009at"&gt;{{Cite news | title = Silvio Berlusconi punched in the face in Milan |work=The Guardian | date = 13 December 2009 | url = https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/dec/13/silvio-berlusconi-punched-in-face | location=London | accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a letter released to the Italian news agency [[Agenzia Nazionale Stampa Associata|ANSA]], Tartaglia has apologised for the attack, writing: "I don't recognise myself", and adding that he had "acted alone [with no] form of militancy or political affiliation".

In the night of 15–16 December a 26-year-old man was stopped by police and Berlusconi's bodyguards while trying to gain access to Berlusconi's hospital room. A search revealed that he carried no weapons, although three hockey sticks and two knives were later found in his car. The suspect was known to have a history of mental illness and mandatory treatment in mental institutions.&lt;ref name="night_attack"&gt;{{Cite news|work=Reggio 24 ore|date=21 December 2009|title=Berlusconi colpito al volto da una statuetta.

==Sexual scandals==

===Wiretaps and accusations of corruption===
In December 2007 the audio recording of a phone call between Berlusconi, then leader of the opposition parties, and Agostino Saccà (general director of [[RAI]]) were published by the magazine ''[[L'espresso]]'' and caused a scandal in several media.&lt;ref name="Ref_2007"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.repubblica.it/2007/12/sezioni/politica/berlusconi-indagato/berlusconi-regime/berlusconi-regime.html|title=Inchiesta Berlusconi "Saccà va sospeso" L'ex premier: "Solleva il morale del Capo"|language=Italian|work=la Repubblica|date=13 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
The wiretap was part of an investigation by the Public Prosecutor Office of [[Naples]], where Berlusconi was investigated for corruption.&lt;ref name="Ref_2007a"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/cronache/07_dicembre_12/berlusconi_indagato_corruzione_sacca_a47dd26e-a884-11dc-8e86-0003ba99c53b.shtml|title=Berlusconi indagato per corruzione|language=Italian|work=Corriere della Sera|date=12 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;
In the phone call, Saccà expresses words of impassioned political support to Berlusconi and criticises the behaviour of Berlusconi's allies. Berlusconi urges Saccà to broadcast a telefilm series which was strongly advocated by his ally Umberto Bossi. Saccà laments that many people have spread rumours on this agreement causing problems to him. Then Berlusconi asks Saccà to find a job in RAI for a young woman explicitly telling him that this woman would serve as an asset in a secret exchange with a senator of the majority who would help him to cause Prodi, with his administration, to fall.&lt;ref name="Ref_2007b"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://espresso.repubblica.it/dettaglio/Pronto-Silvio-sono-Sacca/1917587 |title=Pronto Silvio, sono Saccà |language=Italian |work=L'espresso |location=Italy |date=20 December 2007 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130622044420/http://espresso.repubblica.it/dettaglio/pronto-silvio-sono-sacca/1917587 |archivedate=2013-06-22 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Clarify|date=February 2011}} After the publication of these wiretaps, Berlusconi has been accused by other politicians and by some journalists of political corruption through the exploitation of prostitution. Berlusconi said, in his own defence: "In the entertainment world everybody knows that, in certain situations in RAI TV you work only if you prostitute yourself or if you are leftist. I have intervened on behalf of some personalities who are not leftists and have been completely set apart by RAI TV."&lt;ref name="Ref_2007c"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/07_dicembre_20/berlusconi_rai_sinistra_4933f5e8-aefe-11dc-8fe5-0003ba99c53b.shtml|title=Berlusconi: "In Rai tutti raccomandati"|language=Italian|work=Corriere della Sera|date=20 December 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[US State Department]]'s 2011 Trafficking in Persons report authorized by Secretary of State [[Hillary Clinton]] Mr. Berlusconi was explicitly named as a person involved in the "commercial sexual exploitation of a Moroccan child".&lt;ref name="britmetro"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://e-edition.metro.co.uk/2011/10/31/index.html?p=11 |title=Metro UK - 31/10/2011 digital edition |publisher=E-edition.metro.co.uk |date= |accessdate=1 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20131004235614/http://e-edition.metro.co.uk/2011/10/31/index.html?p=11 |archivedate=4 October 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="brittelegraph"&gt;{{cite news|last=Pisa |first=Nick |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/silvio-berlusconi/8858275/Silvio-Berlusconi-named-on-US-government-report-on-people-trafficking.html |title=Silvio Berlusconi named on US government report on people trafficking |publisher=Telegraph |date= 30 October 2011|accessdate=1 November 2011 |location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Noémie Laetizia, 66ème Festival de Venise (Mostra).jpg|thumb|upright|Noemi Letizia at the [[2009 Venice Film Festival]].]]

At the end of April 2009, [[Veronica Lario]] wrote an [[open letter]] expressing her anger at Berlusconi's choice of young, attractive female candidates—some with little or no political experience—to represent the party in the [[European Parliament election, 2009|2009 European Parliament elections]]. Berlusconi demanded a public apology, claiming that for the third time his wife had "done this to me in the middle of an election campaign", and stated that there was little prospect of his marriage continuing.&lt;ref name="Ref_2009g"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/world/europe/8032392.stm|title=Berlusconi demands wife apology|publisher=BBC News|date=4 May 2009|accessdate=4 May 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 28 May 2009, Silvio Berlusconi said that he had never had "spicy" relations with Noemi Letizia, swearing also on his children's heads. He said also that if any such thing had occurred, he would have resigned immediately.&lt;ref name="Ref_2009s"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.corriere.it/english/09_maggio_29/berlusconi_4939b106-4c49-11de-b7be-00144f02aabc.shtml |work=Corriere della Sera |title=I Never Had Spicy Relations With Noemi.

On 17 June 2009, Patrizia D'Addario, a 42-year old escort and retired actress&lt;ref name="Follain2009"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6590890.ece|work=The Sunday Times |title=Silvio Berlusconi brands sex claims by Patrizia D’Addario as trash|date=28 June 2009 | location=London | first=John | last=Follain | accessdate=30 March 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; from [[Bari]], Italy, claimed that she had been recruited twice (by a mutual friend, who paid her 2000 Euros) in order to spend the evening, and once also the night, with Berlusconi.&lt;ref name="Ref_2009t"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/09_giugno_17/patrizia_sarzanini_intervista_b943f0c0-5afd-11de-8305-00144f02aabc.shtml|title=Incontri e candidatura Ecco la mia verità|language=Italian|date=17 June 2009|work=Corriere della Sera}}&lt;/ref&gt;
Magistrates in Bari are investigating this case, since the friend could be prosecuted for favouring [[Prostitution in Italy|prostitution]].

Silvio Berlusconi denied any knowledge of D'Addario being a paid escort: "I have never paid a woman… I have never understood what satisfaction there is if the pleasure of conquest is absent".&lt;ref name="Ref_2009u"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/politica/09_giugno_23/berlusconi_veronica_chi_f5a40176-5ffe-11de-bd53-00144f02aabc.shtml|title=D'Addario agisce su mandato preciso|language=Italian|date=23 June 2009|work=Corriere della Sera}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also accused an unspecified person of manoeuvring and paying D'Addario (accusations which she vehemently denied).&lt;ref name="Ref_2009v"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.corriere.it/english/09_giugno_24/daddario_3ff75134-60ad-11de-9ec2-00144f02aabc.shtml |work=Corriere della Sera |title=D’Addario Denies PM’s Accusation of Acting on Orders |date=24 June 2009 |accessdate=25 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other young women have also described to the press the parties held in Berlusconi's Rome residence (Palazzo Grazioli),&lt;ref name="Ref_2009w"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.corriere.it/english/09_giugno_17/berlusconi_0c8f8f9e-5c13-11de-b8d9-00144f02aabc.shtml|title=Magistrate Questions Three More Women|date=18 June 2009|accessdate=25 June 2009|work=Corriere della Sera}}&lt;/ref&gt; while photos and transcripts of audio cassettes circulated widely in the press. These descriptions have raised, in particular, concerns about the lack of security measures and the uncontrolled access to the prime minister's residence.&lt;ref name="Ref_2009x"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.corriere.it/english/09_giugno_22/bari_1a9644c6-5f3c-11de-bd53-00144f02aabc.shtml |work=Corriere della Sera |title=Bari Magistrates Claim Access to Premier’s Residence was Uncontrolled |date=22 June 2009 |accessdate=25 June 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 26 June 2009, the "[[10 questions to Berlusconi|10 questions]]" to Berlusconi were reformulated by ''la Repubblica'' newspaper, and then frequently republished on it.&lt;ref name="Ref_2009y"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://temi.repubblica.it/repubblicaspeciale-repubblicaspeciale-ten-new-questions-to-silvio-berlusconi/2009/06/26/ten-new-questions-to-silvio-berlusconi/|title=Ten new questions to Silvio Berlusconi|date=26 June 2009|accessdate=28 August 2009|work=la Repubblica}}&lt;/ref&gt; No answers were given, until 28 August 2009, when Berlusconi sued [[Gruppo Editoriale L'Espresso]], the owner company of the newspaper, and defined these ten questions as "defamatory" and "rhetorical".&lt;ref name="Ref_2009z"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.adnkronos.com/AKI/English/CultureAndMedia/?id=3.0.3707372087|work=[[Adnkronos|AKI]]|title=Berlusconi to sue left-wing daily for over €1 mln|date=28 August 2009|accessdate=28 August 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlusconi's lifestyle has raised eyebrows in Catholic circles, with vigorous criticism being expressed in particular by the newspaper ''[[Avvenire]]'', owned by the [[Conferenza Episcopale Italiana]] (Conference of Italian Bishops). This was followed by the publication in the newspaper il Giornale (owned by the Berlusconi family) of details with regard to legal proceedings against the editor of ''Avvenire'', Dino Boffo, which seemed to implicate him for a harassment case against the wife of his ex-partner.&lt;ref name="Ref_2009aa"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/a.pic1?ID=377663|title=Boffo, il supercensore condannato per molestie|language=Italian|publisher=il Giornale|date=28 August 2009|accessdate=22 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Dino Boffo has always declared the details of the proceedings to be false, although he has not denied the basic premise.&lt;ref name="Ref_2009ab"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.ilgiornale.it/a.pic1?ID=378630|title=Boffo: "E' una patacca".

After a period of tense exchanges and polemics, on 3 September 2009, Boffo resigned from his editorial position&lt;ref name="Ref_2009ac"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://www.avvenire.it/boffo/boffo+dimissioni_200909031239587930000_200909041332052000000.htm |title=La lettera di Boffo al Card.

On 22 September 2009, after a press conference, Silvio Berlusconi declared that he had asked his ministers not to respond anymore to questions regarding "gossip". He stated also that the Italian press should talk only about the "successes" of Italian Government in internal and foreign policies, adding also that the press now will be able only to ask questions such as "how many apartments will be given in [[L'Aquila]]", i.e. relating to his administration and not to [[gossip]].&lt;ref name="Ref_2009af"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.agi.it/english-version/italy/elenco-notizie/200909221932-pol-ren0047-berlusconi_ministers_not_to_respond_to_questions_on_gossip |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20161231002911/http://www.agi.it/english-version/italy/elenco-notizie/200909221932-pol-ren0047-berlusconi_ministers_not_to_respond_to_questions_on_gossip |dead-url=yes |archive-date=31 December 2016 |title=Berlusconi: Ministers not to respond to questions on gossip |work=[[Agenzia Giornalistica Italia|AGI]] |date=22 September 2009 |accessdate=22 September 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Ruby Rubacuori===
In November 2010, teenage Moroccan [[belly dance]]r and alleged prostitute Karima El Mahroug (better known as "[[Ruby Rubacuori]]") claimed to have been given $10,000 by Berlusconi at parties at his private villas. The girl told prosecutors in Milan that these events were like orgies where Berlusconi and 20 young women performed an African-style ritual known as the "[[bunga bunga]]" in the nude.&lt;ref name="Ref_2010d"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/stories/2010/11/09/3061762.htm?section=justin|title=Exile an option for besieged Berlusconi|publisher=[[ABC News (Australia)]]|date=9 November 2010|accessdate=9 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_q"&gt;[http://www.thedailybeast.com/blogs-and-stories/2010-11-07/silvio-berlusconis-bunga-bunga-parties/ Berlusconi’s "Bunga Bunga Orgies":] ''Daily Beast'' 7 November 2010 Retrieved 25 November 2010&lt;/ref&gt;
It was also found out that, on 27 May 2010, El Mahroug had been arrested for theft by the Milan police but (being still a minor) she was directed to a shelter for juvenile offenders. However, following two telephone calls by Berlusconi to the police authorities (in which, in particular, he falsely indicated that El Mahroug was a close relative of President [[Hosni Mubarak]] of [[Egypt]]), the young woman was released and entrusted to the care of [[The People of Freedom|PDL]] regional counselor (and Berlusconi's personal dental hygienist) Nicole Minetti.&lt;ref name="Ref_2010e"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.rainews24.rai.it/it/news.php?newsid=146858|title=Ruby fu affidata a una Comunità, non a Nicole Minetti|publisher=[[RaiNews24]]|date=30 October 2010|accessdate=17 November 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ref_r"&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://news.sky.com/skynews/Home/World-News/Silvio-Berlusconis-Dental-Hygienist-Nicole-Minetti-To-Contest-Italys-Regional-Elections/Article/201002315553227 |title=Silvio Berlusconi's dental hygienist Nicole Minetti to contest Italy's regional elections }}&lt;/ref&gt;
The investigation of Berlusconi for [[extortion]] (''[[:it:concussione]]'') and [[child prostitution]] regarding Karima El Mahroug has been referred to as "[[Rubygate]]".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ilfattoquotidiano.it/2011/01/14/ruby-b-under-investigation-for-child-prostitution-videos-and-photos-found-in-girl%E2%80%99s-laptop/86481/ |title=Ruby, B. under investigation for child prostitution Videos and photos found in girl’s laptop &amp;#124; Redazione Il Fatto Quotidiano &amp;#124; Il Fatto Quotidiano |publisher=Ilfattoquotidiano.it |date=14 January 2011 |accessdate=1 November 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; MP Gaetano Pecorella proposed to lower the [[age of majority]] in Italy to solve the case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://rassegna.governo.it/testo.asp?d=55045063 |title=Governo Italiano&amp;nbsp;— Rassegna stampa |publisher=Rassegna.governo.it |date= |accessdate=1 November 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20111214150134/http://rassegna.governo.it/testo.asp?d=55045063 |archivedate=14 December 2011 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Berlusconi has also come under fire for reportedly spending $1.8&amp;nbsp;million in state funds from [[RAI|RAI Cinema]] to further the career of a largely unknown Bulgarian actress, Michelle Bonev. The fact that this coincided with severe cuts being made to the country's arts budget provoked a strong reaction from the public.

On 24 June 2013, Berlusconi was convicted for paying for sex with Karima El Mahroug and sentenced to seven years in prison, although his sentence will not start until after the appeal process is concluded.&lt;ref name="GuardianJune24-2013"&gt;{{cite news|title=Silvio Berlusconi found guilty of paying for sex with underage prostitute|newspaper=The Guardian|date=June 24, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-23034167|title=Italian ex-PM Berlusconi sentenced in Ruby sex case|publisher=BBC News Online|date=24 June 2013|accessdate=24 June 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Corey Johnson''' (born April 28, 1982) is the Speaker of the [[New York City Council]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Lavers|first1=Michael|title=Corey Johnson elected speaker of NYC Council|url=http://www.washingtonblade.com/2018/01/03/corey-johnson-elected-speaker-nyc-council/|website=The Washington Blade|accessdate=January 3, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a City Council member for the 3rd District. He is a [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]]. The district includes [[Hell’s Kitchen]], [[Chelsea, Manhattan|Chelsea]], the [[West Village]], and parts of [[Flatiron District|Flatiron]], [[SoHo]] and the [[Upper West Side]] in [[Manhattan]].

Prior to his election as Speaker, Johnson was frequently named as a potential candidate, and was perceived as a leading contender.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2017/02/15/nyregion/new-york-city-speaker.html | title=New York City Girds for Political Brawl Over Looming Speaker Vacancy | website=The New York Times|access-date=July 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.gothamgazette.com/city/7008-corey-johnson-s-very-busy-campaign-weekend | title=Corey Johnson’s Very Busy Campaign Weekend | website=Gotham Gazzette|access-date=July 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/city-council-speaker-front-runner-won-seek-reelection-article-1.3212782 | title=City Council speaker race heats up as Melissa Mark-Viverito’s heir apparent won’t seek reelection | website=New York Daily News|access-date=July 29, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; In mid-December 2017, with the public support of Mayor de Blasio, the concession of other front runners, and backing of the Bronx and Queens Democratic Parties, Johnson corralled the requisite number of votes to become the presumptive favorite for the position, with the full Council voting on January 3, 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cityandstateny.com/articles/politics/new-york-city/corey-johnson-new-york-city-council-speaker-race.html#.Wj6TrVSpnOQ|title=Reports Say Corey Johnson is Steps Away from Becoming the next New York City Council Speaker|website=City &amp; State|access-date=December 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Johnson was raised in [[Middleton, Massachusetts]], in a union household by his mother, Ann Queenan Richardson, a homeless services provider, and his step-father, Rodney Richardson, a Teamster.&lt;ref name="Council bio"&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://council.nyc.gov/d3/html/members/bio.shtml|title=Biography|website=council.nyc.gov|access-date=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson's birth father, David Johnson, was born to an American father and Korean mother in South Korea.&lt;ref name="sober"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2018/01/03/nyregion/council-speaker-corey-johnson.html|title=Sober and H.I.V.

Johnson made national headlines in 2000 when, as captain of his high school football team at [[Masconomet Regional High School]], he publicly revealed that he was gay. His story was reported by major national news outlets including ''[[The New York Times]]'' and ''[[20/20 (U.S. TV series)|20/20]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2000/04/30/sports/icon-recast-support-for-a-gay-athlete.html|title=Icon Recast: Support for a Gay Athlete|date=April 30, 2000|website=The New York Times|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=GB PFLAG|title=A Life Rooted in Courage Part 1 of 2|date=February 12, 2015|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=M4hEJkoAcz0|accessdate=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Shortly after graduating high school, Johnson moved to New York City and became engaged in [[LGBT rights in the United States|LGBT rights]] activism, after only spending less than one semester at [[George Washington University]].&lt;ref name="sober"/&gt; Johnson was a contributor and eventually the political director of the LGBT blog [[Andy Towle|Towleroad]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.towleroad.com/2013/09/corey-johnson-declares-victory-in-nyc-city-council-race/|title=Corey Johnson Declares Victory in NYC City Council Race - Towleroad|date=September 10, 2013|newspaper=Towleroad|language=en-US|access-date=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, Johnson joined [[Manhattan Community Board 4]] (CB4), to which he said in 2014 “You don’t spend eight years on the community board because it’s sexy,”, “You’re on the community board because you care about the community.”&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://cityandstateny.com/articles/personality/interviews-and-profiles/meet-the-city-council%E2%80%99s-new-members-corey-johnson.html|title=Meet the City Council’s New Members: Corey Johnson|last=admin|date=2014-01-28|work=CSNY|access-date=2018-02-18|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Johnson was elected Chair of CB4, becoming the youngest Community Board Chair in New York City at the time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://cityandstateny.com/articles/personality/interviews-and-profiles/meet-the-city-council%E2%80%99s-new-members-corey-johnson.html#.V9BdR_krKUk|title=Meet the City Council’s New Members: Corey Johnson|last=State|first=City &amp;|website=cityandstateny.com|access-date=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2011, Johnson was profiled by ''[[City &amp; State]]'' as a "rising star" in New York City politics.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archives.cityandstateny.com/rising-stars-40-under-40-corey-johnson/|title=Rising Stars 40 Under 40: Corey Johnson|date=September 19, 2011|website=City &amp; State|accessdate=December 30, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==New York City Council==
In 2013, [[Christine Quinn]] ran for Mayor of New York City as her term in the City Council was expiring. Johnson, then Chair of Community Board 4, ran to succeed Quinn and was elected in November 2013 with 86% of the vote.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.nytimes.com/projects/elections/2013/general/city-council/results.html|title=New York City Council - 2013 Election Results|website=The New York Times|access-date=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Johnson assumed office on January 1, 2014.

As Chair of the City Council’s Committee on Health, Council Member Johnson has overseen a number of hearings on major health issues affecting New York City, including the [[2015 Bronx Legionnaires' disease outbreaks|Legionnaires’ outbreak of 2015]] and the proliferation of [[synthetic marijuana]], known as K2, in New York.

On April 6, 2016, [[Bill de Blasio|Mayor Bill de Blasio]] signed into law Johnson’s bill that prohibits the use of [[smokeless tobacco]] products, such as [[chewing tobacco]], at sports stadiums and arenas that host events that require a ticket for admission.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2016/04/07/sports/baseball/smokeless-tobacco-ban-new-york-yankees-mets.html|title=It’s Official: Smokeless Tobacco Is Out|last=Berkman|first=Seth|date=April 6, 2016|newspaper=The New York Times|issn=0362-4331|access-date=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; The legislation effectively banned chewing tobacco from professional baseball in New York City.

On June 3, 2015, Johnson was arrested in [[Albany, New York|Albany]] in an act of [[civil disobedience]] while protesting for the extension of [[rent regulation]] and the reform of the rent laws in New York State. In total, 55 protesters were arrested for blocking the entrance to Governor [[Andrew Cuomo|Andrew Cuomo’s]] office in this demonstration.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://thevillager.com/2015/06/04/pols-arrested-in-albany-as-rent-war-ratchets-up/|title=Pols arrested in Albany as rent war ratchets up {{!}} The Villager Newspaper|access-date=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Seniors

The legislation also creates a DFTA ombudsman to take complaints regarding any lack of compliance with these requirements.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=1805819&amp;GUID=05C4F9D7-932B-4057-BAA5-183452CA6B69&amp;Options|title=The New York City Council - File #: Int 0358-2014|last=Tajanko|first=Darius|website=legistar.council.nyc.gov|access-date=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Animal welfare
Johnson worked with Council Member [[Elizabeth Crowley]] in 2014 to introduce a set of bills to regulate the sale of pets in New York City, with the purpose of [[Animal rights|animal protection]]. The bills regulate irresponsible breeders, combat overpopulation, provide for the safe accounting of animals and ensure that known animal abusers are unable to obtain animals. The package of legislation was passed on December 17, 2014.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/blogs/dailypolitics/council-passes-bill-ban-pets-puppy-mills-blog-entry-1.2048942|title=Council passes bill to ban pets from puppy mills|newspaper=NY Daily News|access-date=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Council Member Johnson co-sponsored legislation by Council Member Rosie Mendez to ban the use of wild animals in circuses. In October 2016, Johnson held a hearing in the Health Committee and spoke passionately in support of the legislation, saying to the media "trucking wild animals in and out of the city strictly for entertainment purposes is not a humane way to be treating them.”&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://wtop.com/canada/2016/10/animal-advocates-push-ban-in-nyc-on-exotic-circus-animals/|title=Animal advocates push ban in NYC on exotic circus animals|date=October 13, 2016|publisher=|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; On June 15, 2017, Johnson Chaired a meeting of the Health Committee and successfully passed the bill by a vote of 7-0. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nydailynews.com/new-york/city-council-pushing-wild-animal-ban-circuses-article-1.3250440|title=City Council still pushing for wild animal ban at circuses|publisher=|accessdate=December 28, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The bill heads to the full City Council for a vote on June 21, 2017.

;Transportation
On May 27, 2015 the City Council passed Johnson’s legislation that requires all heavy-duty vehicles in New York City’s fleet to be equipped with sideguards, which are devices meant to reduce casualties commonly caused to pedestrians and cyclists by large trucks.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://legistar.council.nyc.gov/LegislationDetail.aspx?ID=1687945&amp;GUID=9621FABE-B038-4D87-BD30-54547AD24E3F&amp;Options|title=The New York City Council - File #: Int 0198-2014|last=Tajanko|first=Darius|website=legistar.council.nyc.gov|access-date=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

;Labor
In response to a growing trend of hotel rooms being converted into luxury condominiums, Johnson introduced legislation to limit the number of condo conversions that hotel owners can make. The goal of this legislation was to protect jobs in the hotel industry. It was passed by the City Council on May 14, 2015 and signed into law on June 2, 2015.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://therealdeal.com/2015/05/15/city-council-passes-hotel-conversion-bill/|title=City Council passes hotel conversion bill|last= |first=|date=May 15, 2015|website=The Real Deal New York|access-date=December 12, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Criticism of Muhammad''' has existed since the 7th century, when [[Muhammad]] was decried by his [[Religion in pre-Islamic Arabia|non-Muslim Arab]] contemporaries for preaching [[monotheism]], and by the [[Jewish tribes of Arabia]] for his unwarranted appropriation of [[Hebrew Bible|Biblical narratives]] and [[Biblical Figures|figures]],&lt;ref name="JE2"&gt;{{Cquote|The Jews [...] could not let pass unchallenged the way in which [[Biblical and Quranic narratives|the Koran appropriated Biblical accounts and personages]]; for instance, its making Abraham an Arab and the founder of the [[Kaaba|Ka'bah]] at [[Mecca]]. The prophet, who looked upon every evident correction of his gospel as an attack upon his own reputation, brooked no contradiction, and unhesitatingly threw down the gauntlet to the Jews. Numerous passages in the Koran show how he gradually went from slight thrusts to malicious vituperations and brutal attacks on the customs and beliefs of the Jews. When they justified themselves by referring to the Bible, Mohammed, who had taken nothing therefrom at first hand, accused them of intentionally concealing its true meaning or of entirely misunderstanding it, and taunted them with being "asses who carry books" (sura lxii. 5). The increasing bitterness of this vituperation, which was similarly directed against the less numerous [[Arab Christians|Christians]] of [[Medina]], indicated that in time Mohammed would not hesitate to proceed to actual hostilities. The outbreak of the latter was deferred by the fact that the hatred of the prophet was turned more forcibly in another direction, namely, against the [[Quraysh|people of Mecca]], whose earlier refusal of Islam and whose attitude toward the community appeared to him at Medina as a personal insult which constituted a sufficient cause for [[Islam and war|war]].|author=Richard Gottheil, Mary W.

The earliest documented Christian knowledge of Muhammad stems from [[Byzantine]] sources, written shortly after Muhammad's death in 632. In the ''[[Doctrina Jacobi nuper baptizati]]'', a dialogue between a recent [[Christian]] convert and several Jews, one participant writes that his brother "wrote to [him] saying that a [[False prophet|deceiving prophet]] has appeared amidst the [[Saracens]]". Another participant in the ''Doctrina'' replies about Muhammad: "He is deceiving. For do prophets come with sword and [[chariot]]?, …[Y]ou will discover nothing true from the said prophet except human bloodshed".&lt;ref&gt;Walter Emil Kaegi, Jr., "Initial Byzantine Reactions to the Arab Conquest", ''Church History'', Vol. 38, No. 2 (Jun., 1969), pp. 139–49 [139–42], quoting from ''Doctrina Jacobi nuper baptizati'' 86–87&lt;/ref&gt;

One Christian who came under the early dominion of the Islamic [[Caliphate]] was [[John of Damascus]] (c. 676–749 AD), who was familiar with Islam and [[Arabic language|Arabic]]. The second chapter of his book, ''The Fount of Wisdom'', titled "Concerning Heresies", presents a series of discussions between Christians and Muslims. John claimed that an [[Arianism|Arian]] [[Christian monasticism|monk]] (whom he did not know was [[Bahira]]) influenced Muhammad and the writer viewed the Islamic doctrines as nothing more than a hodgepodge culled from the [[Bible]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.orthodoxinfo.com/general/stjohn_islam.aspx Critique of Islam] St. John of Damascus, From Writings, by St John of Damascus, The Fathers of the Church, vol. 37 (Washington, DC: Catholic University of America Press, 1958), pp. 153–60.

In this manuscript, the Syrian priest represents Muhammad as a "false prophet," and an "[[Antichrist]]". Some demonstrate that Muhammad was pointed out in this manuscript as "Mamed",&lt;ref&gt;Cited by Powers, David Stephan. 2009. Muḥammad is not the Father of any of your Men: the Making of the Last Prophet. USA: University of Pennsylvania Press, p. 29.&lt;/ref&gt; but this study was corrected by Ahlam Sbaihat who affirmed that it is the form ΜΩΑΜΕθ (Moameth) which is mentioned in this manuscript.

====Middle Ages====
{{Main|Medieval Christian views on Muhammad|Muhammad in the Bible#Muhammad as Antichrist}}
During the 12th century [[Peter the Venerable]], who saw Muhammad as the precursor to the Anti-Christ and the successor of [[Arius]],&lt;ref name="meyer2"/&gt; ordered the translation of the [[Qur'an]] into [[Latin]] ([[Lex Mahumet pseudoprophete]]) and the collection of information on Muhammad so that Islamic teachings could be refuted by Christian scholars.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;  During the 13th century a series of works by European scholars such as [[Peter Pascual|Pedro Pascual]], [[Ricoldo de Monte Croce]], and [[Ramon Llull]]&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt; depicted Muhammad as an Antichrist and argued that [[Islam]] was a [[Christian heresy]].&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;

The fact that Muhammad was unlettered, that he married a wealthy widow, that in his later life he had several wives, that he ruled over a human community, was involved in several wars, and that he died like an ordinary person in contrast to the Christian belief in the supernatural end of [[Christ]]'s earthly life were all arguments used to discredit Muhammad.&lt;ref name="Britannica"/&gt;  One common allegation laid against Muhammad was that he was an impostor who, in order to satisfy his ambition and his lust, propagated religious teachings that he knew to be false.&lt;ref name="Watt"&gt;Watt, Montgomery, ''Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman.'' Oxford University Press, 1961. From p. 229.&lt;/ref&gt; Some medieval ecclesiastical writers portrayed Muhammad as possessed by [[Satan]], a "precursor of the Antichrist" or the Antichrist himself.&lt;ref name="Oussani"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/10424a.htm |title=Catholic Encyclopedia: Mohammed and Mohammedanism (Islam) |publisher=Newadvent.org |date= |accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; In [[Dante]]'s [[The Divine Comedy]], Muhammad dwells in the 9th ''Bolgia'' of the [[Inferno (Dante)|Eighth Circle of Hell]] and is depicted as disemboweled; the [[contrapasso]] represented thereby implicates Muhammad as a schismatic, figuratively rending the body of the Catholic Church and compromising the integrity of the truth of Christianity in the same way Muhammad's body is depicted as literally wounded.

[[File:Peter the Venerable.jpg|thumb|[[Peter the Venerable]], with other monks, 13th-century [[illuminated manuscript]].]]
A more positive interpretation appears in the 13th-century ''Estoire del Saint Grail'', the first book in the vast [[King Arthur|Arthurian]] cycle, the [[Lancelot-Grail]]. In describing the travels of [[Joseph of Arimathea]], keeper of the [[Holy Grail]], the author says that most residents of the Middle East were [[pagan]]s until the coming of Muhammad, who is shown as a true [[prophet]] sent by God to bring Christianity to the region. This mission however failed when Muhammad's pride caused him to alter God's wishes, thereby deceiving his followers. Nevertheless, Muhammad's religion is portrayed as being greatly superior to paganism.&lt;ref&gt;Lacy, Norris J. (Ed.) (December 1, 1992). ''Lancelot-Grail: The Old French Arthurian Vulgate and Post-Vulgate in Translation,'' Volume 1 of 5. New York: Garland. {{ISBN|0824077334}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

The ''Tultusceptrum de libro domni Metobii'', an [[Andalusia]]n [[manuscript]] with unknown dating, recounts how Muhammad (called Ozim, from [[Hashim]]) was tricked by [[Satan]] into adulterating an originally pure divine revelation. The story argues God was concerned about the spiritual fate of the Arabs and wanted to correct their deviation from the faith. He then sends an angel to the monk Osius who orders him to preach to the Arabs. Osius however is in ill-health and orders a young monk, Ozim, to carry out the angel's orders instead. Ozim sets out to follow his orders, but gets stopped by an evil angel on the way. The ignorant Ozim believes him to be the same angel that spoke to Osius before. The evil angel modifies and corrupts the original message given to Ozim by Osius, and renames Ozim Muhammad. From this followed the erroneous teachings of Islam, according to the ''Tultusceptrum''.&lt;ref&gt;J. Tolan, ''Medieval Christian Perceptions of Islam'' (1996) pp. 100–01&lt;/ref&gt;

====Thomas Aquinas====
[[Thomas Aquinas]] was highly critical of Muhammad's character and ethics, claiming that his teachings were largely in conformity to his immoral lifestyle. He wrote in [[Summa Contra Gentiles]]:

"“[Muhammad] seduced the people by promises of carnal pleasure to which the concupiscence of the flesh goads us. His teaching also contained precepts that were in conformity with his promises, and he gave free rein to carnal pleasure. In all this, as is not unexpected, he was obeyed by carnal men. As for proofs of the truth of his doctrine, he brought forward only such as could be grasped by the natural ability of anyone with a very modest wisdom... Nor do divine pronouncements on the part of preceding prophets offer him any witness. On the contrary, he perverts almost all the testimonies of the Old and New Testaments by making them into fabrications of his own, as can be seen by anyone who examines his law. It was, therefore, a shrewd decision on his part to forbid his followers to read the Old and New Testaments, lest these books convict him of falsity. It is thus clear that those who place any faith in his words believe foolishly.” &lt;ref&gt;Summa Contra Gentiles Book 1, Chapter 16, Art.4&lt;/ref&gt;

====Martin Luther====

[[Martin Luther]] referred to Muhammad as "a devil and first-born child of Satan."&lt;ref&gt;[[s:Catholic Encyclopedia (1913)/Mohammed and Mohammedanism|"Mohammed and Mohammedanism"]], [[Catholic Encyclopedia]], 1913&lt;/ref&gt; Luther's primary target of criticism at the time was the Pope, and Luther's characterization of Muhammad was intended to draw a comparison to show that the Pope was worse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Moncure Daniel Conway |title=Demonology and Devil-lore, Volume 2 |publisher=H.

====20th-century====
In the early 20th century Western scholarly views of Muhammad changed, including critical views. In the 1911 ''[[Catholic Encyclopedia]]'' Gabriel Oussani states that Muhammad was inspired by an "imperfect understanding" of [[Judaism]] and Christianity, but that the views of Luther and those who call Muhammad a "wicked impostor", a "dastardly liar" and a "willful deceiver" are an "indiscriminate abuse" and "unsupported by facts." Instead, 19th-century [[Western world|Western]] scholars such as [[Aloys Sprenger]], [[Theodor Noldeke]], [[Gustav Weil]], [[William Muir]], [[Sigismund Koelle]], [[Grimme]] and [[D.S. Margoliouth]] "give us a more correct and unbiased estimate of Muhammad's life and character, and substantially agree as to his motives, prophetic call, personal qualifications, and sincerity."&lt;ref name="Oussani"/&gt;

Muir, [[Marcus Dods (theologian)|Marcus Dods]] and others have suggested that Muhammad was at first sincere, but later became deceptive. Koelle finds "the key to the first period of Muhammad's life in [[Khadija bint Khuwaylid|Khadija]], his first wife," after whose death he became prey to his "evil passions."&lt;ref name="Oussani"/&gt; [[Samuel Marinus Zwemer]], a [[Mission (Christian)|Christian missionary]], criticised the life of Muhammad by the standards of the [[Hebrew Bible|Old]] and [[New Testament]]s, by the pagan [[morality]] of his Arab compatriots, and last, by the new law which he brought.&lt;ref&gt;Zwemer suggests Muhammad defied Arab ethical traditions, and that he personally violated the strict [[sexual morality]] of his own moral system.&lt;/ref&gt; Quoting Johnstone, Zwemer concludes by claiming that his harsh judgment rests on evidence which "comes all from the lips and the pens of his [i.e. Muhammad's] own devoted adherents."&lt;ref name="Oussani"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zwemer, "Islam, a Challenge to Faith" (New York, 1907)&lt;/ref&gt;

In his 1875 work [[Satyarth Prakash]], [[Dayanand Saraswati]], the founder of [[Arya Samaj]], quoted and interpreted several verses of the Koran and described Muhammad as "pugnacious", an "imposter", and one who held out "a bait to men and women, in the name of God, to compass his own selfish needs."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Satyarth Prakash (The Light of Truth)|year=1875|last=Saraswati|first=Dayanand|chapter=An Examination Of The Doctrine Of Islam|pages=672–83|publisher=Star Press|location=Varanasi, India|chapter-url=http://www.aryasamajjamnagar.org/chapterfourteen.htm|accessdate=April 2, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Swami Vivekananda]] wrote in his 1896 book [[Raja Yoga (book)|Raja Yoga]] that though Muhammad was inspired, "he was not a trained ''Yogi'', nor did he know the reason of what he was doing."

====1920s caricatures====
In the 1920s, three caricatures published by Hindus attacked Muhammad and marriages—the book ''Vichitra Jivan'' (meaning ''Strange Life'') by Pandit Kalicharan Sharma in 1923, the pamphlet ''[[Rangila Rasul]]'' (meaning ''The Colourful Prophet'') by an anonymous author going by the pseudonym of Pandit Chamupati in 1924, and the essay ''Sair-i-Dozakh'' (meaning ''The Trip to Hell'') by Devi Sharan Sharma in 1927.&lt;ref name="grt1975"&gt;{{cite book

}}&lt;/ref&gt; In ''Vichitra Jivan'', Sharma wrote that Muhammad fell victim to many evils, all his marriages were extraordinary and improper, and that he suffered from epilepsy.&lt;ref name="grt1975"/&gt;

Sharma examined in detail the "marvelous powers" of Muhammad, the "products of his body", and every feature of his "marital and sexual relations", and ended the book by saying that such a person could not have been a divine messenger.&lt;ref name="grt1975"/&gt; The ''Sair-i-Dozakh'' was a take on the [[Isra and Mi'raj]], Muhammad's journey to heaven and hell according to Islamic traditions. Described as a "brutal satire" by Gene Thursby, it described a dream purportedly experienced by the author in which he mounts a mysterious animal and sees various Hindu and Sikh deities and Gurus in the realm of salvation.&lt;ref name="grt1975"/&gt;

====Modern criticism====
Jai Maharaj, sponsor of the ''Satyameva Jayate'' website, wrote that Muhammad was "in fact a terrorist, criminal and murderer whose entire life was based on victimizing innocents and indulging in mindless violence, carnage and massacre." Maharaj chronicled what he called were Muhammad's "criminal acts in the form of battles and murders", including the killing of four merchants during the sacred month of [[Rajab]], the killing of 70 merchants and 900 men from Mecca, the killing of the poets [['Asma' bint Marwan]] and [[Abu 'Afak]], and the initial motivation to kill followed by eventual expelling of the Jewish tribe of [[Invasion of Banu Qaynuqa|Banu Qaynuqa]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Voltaire===
[[File:MahometFanatisme.jpg|thumb|right|upright|[[Book frontispiece|Frontispiece]] of the 1753 edition of [[Voltaire]]'s play [[Mahomet (play)|Mahomet]]]]
''[[Mahomet (play)|Mahomet]]'' ([[French language|French]]: ''Le fanatisme, ou Mahomet le Prophète'', literally "Fanaticism, or Mahomet the Prophet") is a five-act [[tragedy]] written in 1736 by [[French people|French]] playwright and philosopher [[Voltaire]]. It made its debut performance in [[Lille]] on 25 April 1741. The play is a study of [[religious fanaticism]] and [[Psychological manipulation|self-serving manipulation]] based on an episode in the traditional biography of Muhammad in which he orders the murder of his critics. Voltaire described the play as "written in opposition to the founder of a false and barbarous sect to whom could I with more propriety inscribe a [[satire]] on the cruelty and errors of a false prophet".&lt;ref&gt;''The Works of Voltaire: The Dramatic Works of Voltaire.'' Voltaire, Tobias George Smollett, John Morley, William F. Fleming, Oliver Herbrand Gordon Leigh. Publisher Werner, 1905. Original from Princeton University. p. 12&lt;/ref&gt;

In a letter to [[Frederick II of Prussia]] in 1740 Voltaire ascribes to Muhammad a brutality that "is assuredly nothing any man can excuse" and suggests that his following stems from [[superstition]] and lack of [[Age of Enlightenment|Enlightenment]].&lt;ref&gt;"But that a camel-merchant should stir up insurrection in his village; that in league with some miserable followers he persuades them that he talks with the angel Gabriel; that he boasts of having been carried to heaven, where he received in part this unintelligible book, each page of which makes common sense shudder; that, to pay homage to this book, he delivers his country to iron and flame; that he cuts the throats of fathers and kidnaps daughters; that he gives to the defeated the choice of his religion or death: this is assuredly nothing any man can excuse, at least if he was not born a Turk, or if superstition has not extinguished all natural light in him." – Referring to Muhammad, in a letter to [[Frederick II of Prussia]] (December 1740), published in ''Oeuvres complètes de Voltaire'', Vol. 7 (1869), edited by Georges Avenel, p. 105&lt;/ref&gt; He wanted to portray Muhammad as "[[Tartuffe]] with a sword in his hand."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title = The Atheist's Bible: The Most Dangerous Book That Never Existed|author = Georges Minois|publisher = University of Chicago Press|page = 198|isbn = 978-0226530307|date = 2012-10-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Je sais que Mahomet n’a pas tramé précisément l’espèce de trahison qui fait le sujet de cette tragédie... Je n’ai pas prétendu mettre seulement une action vraie sur la scène, mais des moeurs vraies; faire penser les hommes comme ils pensent dans les circonstances où ils se trouvent, et représenter enfin ce que la fourberie peut inventer de plus atroce, et ce que le fanatisme peut exécuter de plus horrible. Mahomet n’est ici autre chose que Tartuffe les armes à la main." – Letter D2386, to [[Frederick II of Prussia]] (January 1740), published in ''The Complete Works of Voltaire'', Institus et Musée Voltaire, 1971, XCI, p. 383&lt;/ref&gt;

===Modern Western criticisms===
Modern critics have criticized Muhammad for preaching beliefs that are incompatible with [[democracy]]; [[Somali people|Somali]]-[[Dutch people|Dutch]] [[feminist]] writer [[Ayaan Hirsi Ali]] has called him a "tyrant"&lt;ref name=Hirsi&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/stories/2005/03/11/60minutes/main679609.shtml |title=Slaughter And 'Submission' |publisher=CBS News |date= |accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a "pervert".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/spiegel/0,1518,399263,00.html |title=SPIEGEL Interview with Ayaan Hirsi Ali: 'Everyone Is Afraid to Criticize Islam'  |publisher=Spiegel.de |date=2006-02-06 |accessdate=2015-09-29|newspaper=Spiegel Online  }}&lt;/ref&gt; The Dutch [[Party for Freedom]] leader [[Geert Wilders]] calls Muhammad a "mass murderer and a pedophile".&lt;ref name=Wilders&gt;{{cite web| title=Muhammad was a pedophile; press conference with Geert Wilders |date=2010-03-05 |url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eXuG4KhfCZM}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Neuroscientist and prominent ideological critic [[Sam Harris]] contrasts the example of Muhammad with that of Jesus Christ. While he regards Christ as something of a "hippie" figure, Muhammad is an altogether different character and one whose example "as held in Islam is universally not [that of] a pacifist," but rather one of a "conquering warlord who spread the faith by the sword." Harris notes that while sayings such as "render unto Caesar that which is Caesar's" provide Christianity with a "rationale for peace," it is impossible to justify non-violence as central to Islam. Harris says that the example of Muhammad provides an imperative to "convert, subjugate, or kill" and "the core principle of Islam is Jihad."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=prWFkt9-HT0 |title=Debate Chris Hedges vs Sam Harris Religion |publisher=YouTube |date=2011-11-25 |accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; Harris also suggests that Muhammad "may well have been schizophrenic," dismissing Muhammad's claim that the Koran was dictated to him by the archangel Gabriel.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xnoxnzVvb5c |title=Sam Harris.

American historian [[Daniel Pipes]] sees Muhammad as a politician, stating that "because Muhammad created a new community, the religion that was its [[wikt:raison d'être|raison d'être]] had to meet the political needs of its adherents."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Pipes | first=Daniel | title=In the Path of God : Islam and Political Power | year=2002 | publisher=Transaction Publishers | isbn=978-0765809810 | page=43}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2012 a film titled ''[[Innocence of Muslims]]'' and alternatively ''The Real Life of Muhammad'' and ''Muhammad Movie Trailer'' was released by [[Nakoula Basseley Nakoula]]. A ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' article described the video as "Exceptionally amateurish, with disjointed dialogue, jumpy editing, and performances that would have looked melodramatic even in a silent movie, the clip is clearly designed to offend Muslims, portraying Mohammed as a bloodthirsty murderer and [[Lothario]] and [[pedophile]] with omnidirectional sexual appetites."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.vanityfair.com/culture/2012/12/making-of-innocence-of-muslims|title=The Making of The Innocence of Muslims: Cast Members Discuss the Film That Set Fire to the Arab World|last=Gross|first=Michael Joseph|date=December 27, 2012|work=Vanity Fair|accessdate=22 May 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Reactions to Innocence of Muslims|Reacting]] to the release of the film, violent demonstrations and attacks targeted western institutions through the Muslim world.

===Ownership of slaves===

According to contemporary historians, Muhammad had no intention to abolish slavery,&lt;ref name="Gordon1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy2000"&gt;{{cite book |last=Levy |first=Reuben |date=2000 |title=The Social Structure of Islam |location=NY |publisher=Routledge |chapter=Slavery in Islam |pp=73-90 |isbn=978-0415209106}}&lt;/ref&gt; which was already practiced in [[pre-Islamic Arabia]], as he saw it "as part of the natural order of things",&lt;ref name="Gordon1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy2000"/&gt; but rather he wanted to reform it to improve the condition of slaves, and exhorted his followers to treat them more humanely.&lt;ref name="Gordon1989"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Levy2000"/&gt; Muhammad made it legal for his men to marry their slaves and the [[Women in Islam|women]] they captured in war, giving them full marriage rights.&lt;ref&gt;See [[Tahfeem ul Qur'an]] by [[Maududi|Sayyid Abul Ala Maududi]], Vol. 2, pp. 112–13, footnote 44; Also see commentary on verses {{Quran-usc-range|23|1|6}}: Vol. 3, notes 7-1, p. 241; 2000, Islamic Publications.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;''[[Tafsir ibn Kathir]]'' 4:24.&lt;/ref&gt; In addition, according to Muslim theologians, he made it lawful for male masters to have sexual relations with female captives and slaves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nONGQW6X2F8 |title=YouTube |publisher=YouTube |date= |accessdate=2015-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_1.shtml "Slavery in Islam,"] ''[[BBC Online]],'' November 7, 2009 (accessed November 19, 2013)&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Rodney Stark]] argues that "the fundamental problem facing Muslim theologians vis-à-vis the morality of slavery is that ''Muhammad bought, sold, captured, and owned slaves''", though he states that Muhammad did advise that slaves be treated well: "Feed them what you eat yourself and clothe them with what you wear...They are God's people like unto you and be kind unto them". In addition, Stark contrasts Islam with Christianity, implying that Christian theologians wouldn't have been able to "work their way around the biblical acceptance of slavery" if Jesus had owned slaves like Muhammad did.&lt;ref&gt;Rodney Stark, "For the Glory of God: How Monotheism Led to Reformations, Science, Witch-Hunts, and the End of Slavery", p. 338, 2003, [[Princeton University Press]], {{ISBN|0691114366}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some Western thinkers and Christian evangelicals{{who|date=January 2011}} criticize Muhammad for having had a child (Ibrahim, who died in infancy) by a slave girl called [[Maria al-Qibtiyya]], one of his concubines who was a present from the Christian Byzantine ruler of Egypt. Sources, including [[Ibn Qayyim Al-Jawziyya]] claim that she was a [[concubine]] and not a slave.&lt;ref&gt;Exegesis (Tafsir) of Quran by ibn Kathir for Chapter 66, verses 1-5 of Quran&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Zaad al-Ma’aad, 1/103&lt;/ref&gt; She is also not mentioned in Ibn-Hisham's notes on Ibn-Ishaq's biography where he lists the wives of Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ibn Ishaq]], translation by A. Guillaume (1955). ''The Life of Muhammad''. Oxford University Press. p. 792.&lt;/ref&gt; According to a hadith, Muhammad left no slaves at the time of his death.&lt;ref&gt;{{hadith-usc|usc=yes|Bukhari|4|51|002}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the five pillars of Islam (according to the Sunnis), or one of the five Furoo-e-Deen ("Branches of Religion," according to Shi'as), [[Zakat]] is meant to encourage Muslims to donate money to free slaves and [[bonded labour]]ers in countries where slaves and bonded labourers may have existed. The amount of zakat to be paid on [[Financial capital|capital assets]] (e.g. money) is 2.5% (1/40)&lt;ref name=AhmedGianci&gt;Medani Ahmed and Sebastian Gianci, ''Zakat'', Encyclopedia of Taxation and Tax Policy,  p. 479&lt;/ref&gt; for people who are not poor. Muhammad would send his companions like [[Abu Bakr]] and [[Uthman ibn Affan]] to buy slaves to free. Many early converts to Islam were the poor and former slaves like [[Bilal ibn Rabah al-Habashi]].&lt;ref&gt;Ali Ünal, ''The Qur'an with Annotated Interpretation in Modern English'', [https://books.google.com/books?id=DyuqdDIjaswC&amp;pg=PA1323 p. 1323]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of the Qur'an]], Slaves and Slavery&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Bilal b. Rabah, ''[[Encyclopedia of Islam]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Muhammad emphasized the kind treatment of slaves and torturing or mistreating them was forbidden in Islam.&lt;ref name="Gordon1989"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.oswego.edu/~agyeman/agyeman/process.htm|title=Islam and Slavery|last=|first=|date=|website=[[State University of New York at Oswego]]|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20180930023452/http://www.oswego.edu/~agyeman/agyeman/process.htm|archive-date=2018-09-30|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_1.shtml|title= Islam: Slavery in Islam|last=|first=|date=|website=[[BBC]] Religion|publisher=|language=en-GB|archive-url=http://web.archive.org/web/20181006015406/http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/islam/history/slavery_1.shtml|archive-date=2018-10-06|dead-url=no|access-date=2018-10-06}}&lt;/ref&gt; Still, the [[Arab slave trade]] lasted until the 20th century,&lt;ref name="Beigbeder2006"&gt;{{cite book |last=Beigbeder |first=Yves |date=2006 |title=Judging War Crimes and Torture: French Justice and International Criminal Tribunals and Commissions (1940-2005) |location=[[Leiden]] |publisher=[[Martinus Nijhoff Publishers]] |page=42 |isbn=978-9004153295

[[Norman Geisler]] accuses Muhammad of "mercilessness" towards the Jewish tribes of Medina.&lt;ref name="Geisler 1999 Character of Muhammad"/&gt;  Geisler also argues that Muhammad "had no aversion to politically expedient assassinations," "was not indisposed to breaking promises when he found it advantageous" and "engaged in retaliation towards those who mocked him."&lt;ref name="Geisler 1999 Character of Muhammad"&gt;[[Norman Geisler|Geisler, N.L.]] (1999). In Baker encyclopedia of Christian apologetics. Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Books.

(1861). The Life of Mahomet, Volume IV (pp. 307–09). London: Smith, Elder and Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;[[Thomas Patrick Hughes]] also accuses Muhammad of cruelty.  "A striking instance of the cruelty of Muḥammad’s character occurs in a tradition given in the Ṣaḥīḥu ’l-Bukhārī (p. 1019). Anas relates, “Some of the people of the tribe of ‘Ukl came to the Prophet and embraced Islām; but the air of al-Madīnah did not agree with them, and they wanted to leave the place. And the Prophet ordered them to go where the camels given in alms were assembled, and to drink their milk, which they did, and recovered from their sickness. But after this they became apostates, and renounced Islām, and stole the camels. Then the Prophet sent some people after them, and they were seized and brought back to al-Madīnah. Then the Prophet ordered their hands and their feet to be cut off as a punishment for theft, and their eyes to be pulled out. But the Prophet did not stop the bleeding, and they died.” And in another it reads, “The Prophet ordered hot irons to be drawn across their eyes, and then to be cast on the plain of al-Madīnah; and when they asked for water it was not given them, and they died.”"  [[Thomas Patrick Hughes|Hughes, T.P.]] (1885).

Allen &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;
{{quote|
Magnanimity or moderation are nowhere discernible as features in the conduct of Mahomet towards such of his enemies as failed to tender a timely allegiance. Over the bodies of the Coreish who fell at Badr, he exulted with savage satisfaction; and several prisoners,—accused of no crime but that of scepticism and political opposition,—were deliberately executed at his command. The Prince of Kheibar, after being subjected to inhuman torture for the purpose of discovering the treasures of his tribe, was, with his cousin, put to death on the pretext of having treacherously concealed them: and his wife was led away captive to the tent of the conqueror. Sentence of exile was enforced by Mahomet with rigorous severity on two whole Jewish tribes at Medîna; and of a third, likewise his neighbours, the women and children were sold into distant captivity, while the men, amounting to several hundreds, were butchered in cold blood before his eyes. ... The perfidious attack at Nakhla, where the first blood in the internecine war with the Coreish was shed, although at first disavowed by Mahomet for its scandalous breach of the sacred usages of Arabia, was eventually justified by a pretended revelation. ... The pretext on which the Bani Nadhîr were besieged and expatriated (namely, that Gabriel had revealed their design against the prophet’s life,) was feeble and unworthy of an honest cause. When Medîna was beleaguered by the confederate army, Mahomet sought the services of Nueim, a traitor, and employed him to sow distrust among the enemy by false and treacherous reports; “for,” said he, “what else is War but a game at deception?” ... And what is perhaps worst of all, the dastardly assassination of political and religious opponents, countenanced and frequently directed as they were in all their cruel and perfidious details by Mahomet himself, leaves a dark and indelible blot upon his character.&lt;ref name = "Muir 1861 IV p307-309"/&gt;}}
[[Jean de Sismondi]] suggests that Muhammad had a specific animosity against Jews, because of the few differences that separated two mostly similar cults. He is among the historians suggesting that he killed many Jews through supplice, whereas he was usually known for his clemency.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book| title=Histoire de la chute de Rome et du déclin de la civilisation occidentale | first=Jean | last=de Sismondi |language=French | author-link=Jean de Sismondi|quote=Mahomet devoit aux juifs une partie de ses connoissances et de sa religion; mais il éprouvoit contre eux cette haine qui semble s'animer dans les sectes religieuses, lorsqu'il n'y a entre elles qu'une seule différence au milieu de nombreux rapports.

Mahomet les attaqua successivement, de l'an 628 à l'an 627 ; il né se contenta pas de partager leurs richesses, il abandonna presque tous les vaincus à des supplices qui, dans d'autres guerres, souilloient rarement ses armes.}} (book 2, pp. 27-28)&lt;/ref&gt;

====Jewish tribes of Medina====
[[File:Banu Qurayza.png|thumb|The massacre of the [[Banu Qurayza]]]]
{{see also|Invasion of Banu Qurayza}}
Muhammad has been often criticized outside of the Islamic world for his treatment of the Jewish tribes of Medina.&lt;ref name="Esposito18"/&gt; An example is the mass killing of the men of the [[Banu Qurayza]], a Jewish tribe of Medina. The tribe was accused of having engaged in [[treason]]ous agreements with the enemies besieging Medina in the [[Battle of the Trench]] in 627.&lt;ref&gt;Bukhari {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes-usc|5|59|362}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Daniel W. Brown, ''A New Introduction to Islam'', p. 81, 2003, Blackwell Publishers, {{ISBN|0-631-21604-9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Ibn Ishaq]] writes that Muhammad approved the beheading of some 600–700 in all, with some saying as high as 800–900, who surrendered after a siege that lasted several weeks.&lt;ref name=IbnIshaq&gt;Ibn Ishaq, A. Guillaume (translator), ''The Life of Muhammad'', p. 464, 2002, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0196360331}}&lt;/ref&gt; (Also see Bukhari {{Hadith-usc|Bukhari|usc=yes-usc|5|59|362}}) ([[Abdullah Yusuf Ali|Yusuf Ali]] notes that the Qur'an discusses this battle in verses {{Quran-usc-range|33|10|27}}).&lt;ref&gt;Yusuf Ali, "The Meaning of the Holy Quran", (11th Edition), p. 1059, Amana Publications, 1989, {{ISBN|0915957760}}&lt;/ref&gt; They were buried in a mass grave in the Medina market place, and the women and children were sold into slavery.

According to [[Norman Stillman]], the incident cannot be judged by present-day moral standards. Citing Deut. 20:13–14 as an example, Stillman states that the slaughter of adult males and the enslavement of women and children—though no doubt causing bitter suffering—was common practice throughout the ancient world.&lt;ref&gt;Stillman (1974), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; According to Rudi Paret, adverse public opinion was more a point of concern to Muhammad when he had some date palms cut down during a siege, than after this incident.&lt;ref&gt;Quoted in Stillman (1974), p. 16&lt;/ref&gt; Esposito also argues that in Muhammad's time, traitors were executed and points to similar situations in the Bible.&lt;ref&gt;[[BBC Radio 4]], Beyond Belief, Oct 2, 2006, ''Islam and the sword''&lt;/ref&gt; Esposito says that Muhammad's motivation was political rather than racial or theological; he was trying to establish Muslim dominance and rule in Arabia.&lt;ref name="Esposito18"/&gt;

Some historians, such as W.N.

[[Robert Spencer (author)|Robert Spencer]] pointed out that [[Muhammad in Islam|Muhammad]] said in one Sunni Hadith:&lt;ref&gt;Spencer, Robert, '[[The Truth About Muhammad]]' (2006). pp. 165–66:&lt;/ref&gt; {{cquote|Allah's Apostle said, "I have been sent with the shortest expressions bearing the widest meanings, and I have been made victorious with terror (cast in the hearts of the enemy), and while I was sleeping, the keys of the treasures of the world were brought to me and put in my hand."

===Death of Kenana ibn al-Rabi===
{{main|Kenana ibn al-Rabi}}
According to one account, after the last fort of the Jewish settlement called [[Khaybar]] was taken by Muhammad and his men, the chief of the Jews, called [[Kinana ibn al-Rabi]], was asked by Muhammad to reveal the location of some hidden treasure. When he refused, Muhammad ordered a man to torture Kinana, and the man "kindled a fire with flint and steel on his chest until he was nearly dead." Kinana was then beheaded, and Muhammad took his young wife Safiyya as a concubine.&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Ishaq, A. Guillaume (translator), ''The Life of Muhammad'', pp. 510–17, 2002, Oxford University Press, {{ISBN|0196360331}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Critics take these events, especially the story of the torture of Kinana, to be another blot on Muhammad's character.&lt;ref name = "Muir 1861 IV p307-309"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Ibn Warraq, ''Why I Am Not a Muslim'', p. 99, Prometheus Books, 1995, {{ISBN|0879759844}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Those few Western scholars who discuss the alleged torture of Kinana, like William Muir, have generally not questioned the validity of the story.&lt;ref&gt;William Muir, ''Life of Mahomet'', p. 391, 2003, Kessinger Publishing, {{ISBN|0766177416}}&lt;/ref&gt; Muslims generally dispute this incident.

===Muhammad's marriages===

{{Quote box|align=right|width=30em|Muhammad's marriages have long provided another source of Western criticism of the moral character of the prophet.|salign=right|[[John Esposito]]|''[[Islam: The Straight Path]]''&lt;ref&gt;[[John Esposito|John L. Esposito]], ''[[Islam: The Straight Path]]'', Third Edition, [[Oxford University Press]], 1998, p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

One of the popular historical criticisms of Muhammad in the West has been his [[Polygyny in Islam|polygynous]] marriages.&lt;ref name="Esposito18"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Rahman"&gt;Fazlur Rahman, ''Islam'', p. 28&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Before leaving the subject of marriages, it may be proper to take notice of some peculiar privileges in relation thereto, which, as is asserted, were granted by God to Muhammad, to the exclusion of all other Muslims. One of them was, that he might lawfully marry as many wives and have as many concubines as he pleased, without being confined to any particular number; a privilege which, he asserted, had been granted to the prophets before him. Another was, that he might alter the turns of his wives, and favour such of them as he thought fit, without being tied to that order and equality which others are obliged to observe. A third privilege was, that no man might marry any of his wives, either such as he should divorce during his lifetime, or such as he should leave widows at his death." Wollaston, A.N. (1905). ''The Sword of Islam'' (p. 327). New York: E.P. Dutton and Company.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref group=Note&gt;See for example William Muir, who says "Shortly after the death of Khadîja, the Prophet married again; but it was not till the mature age of fifty-four that he made the dangerous trial of polygamy, by taking Ayesha, yet a child, as the rival of Sauda. Once the natural limits of restraint were overpassed, Mahomet fell an easy prey to his strong passion for the sex. In his fifty-sixth year he married Haphsa; and the following year, in two succeeding months, Zeinab bint Khozeima, and Omm Salma. But his desires were not to be satisfied by the range of a harem already greater than was permitted to any of his followers; rather, as age advanced, they were stimulated to seek for new and varied indulgence. A few months after his nuptials with Zeinab and Omm Salma, the charms of a second Zeinab were by accident discovered too fully before the Prophet's admiring gaze. She was the wife of Zeid, his adopted son and bosom friend; but he was unable to smother the flame she had kindled in his breast; and, by divine command she was taken to his bed. In the same year he married a seventh wife, and also a concubine. And at last, when he was full threescore years of age, no fewer than three new wives, besides Mary the Coptic slave, were within the space of seven months added to his already well filled harem. The bare recital of these facts may justify the saying of Ibn Abbâs,—"Verily the chiefest among the Moslems (meaning Mahomet) was the foremost of them in his passion for women;"—a fatal example imitated too readily by his followers, who adopt the Prince of Medîna, rather than the Prophet of Mecca, for their pattern." Muir, W. (1861). The Life of Mahomet (Vol. 4, pp. 309–11). London: Smith, Elder and Co.&lt;/ref&gt; According to American historian [[John Esposito]], the [[Semitic cultures]] in general permitted [[polygamy]] (for example, the practice could be found in biblical and postbiblical Judaism); it was particularly a common practice among [[Arab]]s, especially among nobles and leaders.&lt;ref name="Esposito18"&gt;[[John Esposito]], ''Islam the Straight Path'', [[Oxford University Press]], pp. 17–18&lt;/ref&gt;

Muslims have often pointed out that Muhammad married Khadija (a widow whose age is estimated to have been 40), when he was 25 years old, and remained [[Monogamy|monogamous]] to her for more than 24 years until she died.&lt;ref name="Esposito18"/&gt; [[Norman Geisler]] frames Muhammad's marriages as a question of moral inconsistency, since Muhammad was unwilling to abide by the revealed limit of four wives that he enjoined on other men.&lt;ref&gt;"Muhammad received a revelation from God that a man should have no more than four wives at once, yet he had many more. A Muslim defender of Muhammad, writing in ''The Prophet of Islam as the Ideal Husband'', admitted that he had fifteen wives. Yet he tells others they may have only four. How can someone be a perfect moral example and not live by one of the basic laws he laid down for others as from God?"  [[Norman Geisler|Geisler, N.L.]] (1999). In Baker encyclopedia of Christian apologetics. Grand Rapids, MI: Baker Books. Article on ''Muhammad, Character of''.&lt;/ref&gt; The Quran states that the limit of four wives does not apply to Muhammad.{{Quran-usc|33|50|q=}}{{Original research inline|date=October 2018}} Muslims have generally responded that the marriages of Muhammad were not conducted to satisfy worldly desires or lusts, but rather they were done for a higher purpose and due to God's command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url= https://books.google.com/books?id=GAxh0K8-BVgC&amp;pg=PA136|title= Critical Lives: Muhammad|author=Yahiya Emerick|year=2014|publisher=Alpha Books|location=|page=136|isbn= 978-0028643717|accessdate=2015-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Medieval [[Sufi]], [[Ibn Arabi]], sees Muhammad's relationships with his wives as a proof of his superiority amongst men.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= https://bewley.virtualave.net/fusus27.html|title= The Seals of Wisdom (Fusus Al-Hikam)|author=Ibn Arabi|others=Aisha Bewley|accessdate=2015-03-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Esposito states that polygamy served multiple purposes, including solidifying political alliances among Arab chiefs and marrying widows of companions who died in combat that needed protection.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=https://pages.uoregon.edu/aweiss/IslamGlobalForces/Esposito%20Week%201.pdf|title=Islam: The Straight Path|last=Esposito|first=John L.|publisher=[[Oxford University Press]]|year=2005|isbn=|edition=Revised Third|location=|pages=16–17|quote=As was customary for Arab chiefs, many were political marriages to cement alliances.

====Zaynab bint Jahsh====
{{Main|Zaynab bint Jahsh}}
Western criticism has focused especially on the marriage of Muhammad to his first cousin [[Zaynab bint Jahsh]], the divorced wife of [[Zayd ibn Harithah]], an ex-slave whom Muhammad had adopted as his son.&lt;ref&gt;''A modern Arabic biography of Muḥammad''. Antonie Wessels. Publisher Brill Archive, 1972. {{ISBN|9004034153}} pp. 100–15&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Tabari]], taken from [[Al-Waqidi]], the story goes that&lt;ref&gt;Tabari VIII:3 ^ Tabari VIII:4&lt;/ref&gt; "One day Muhammad went out looking for Zayd. There was a covering of haircloth over the doorway, but the wind had lifted the covering so that the doorway was uncovered. Zaynab was in her chamber, undressed, and admiration for her entered the heart of the Prophet. After that Allah made her unattractive to [[Zayd ibn Harithah|Zayd]] and he divorced Zainab." Karen Armstrong's 2006 biography of Muhammad contextualises this: "A pious woman, [Zaynab] was a skilled leather-worker and gave all the proceeds of her craft to the poor. Muhammad seems to have seen her with new eyes and to have fallen in love quite suddenly when he had called at her house one afternoon to speak to Zayd, who happened to be out. Not expecting any visitors, Zaynab had come to the door in dishabille, more revealingly dressed than usual, and Muhammad had averted his eyes hastily, muttering 'Praise be to Allah, who changes men's hearts!'"&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt;

According to William Montgomery Watt, Zaynab herself was working for marriage with Muhammad and was not happy being married to Zayd.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=zLN2hNidLw4C&amp;dq| author=[[William Montgomery Watt]]|year=1961|publisher=Oxford University Press|page=158|isbn=978-0198810780}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1961), p. 157&lt;/ref&gt; Watt also places doubt on the story outlined by [[Al-Waqidi]] and states that it should be taken with a "grain of salt."&lt;ref name="Watt1961, p.158"&gt;Watt (1961), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; According to Watt, Zaynab was either thirty-five or thirty-eight years old at the time and that the story initially outlined by [[Al-Waqidi]] in which he detailed Muhammad's incident with Zaynab during the absence of Zayd may have been tampered with in the course of transmission.&lt;ref name="Watt1961, p.158"&gt;Watt (1961), p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; According to Mazheruddin Siddiqi, Zaynab as the cousin of Muhammad was seen by him many times before her marriage to Zayd.&lt;ref&gt;{{citation|title=The Holy Prophet and the Orientalists|author=Mazheruddin Siddiqi|year=1980|publisher=Islamic Research Institute|page=163)}}&lt;/ref&gt; Siddiqi states: "He [Muhammad] had seen her many times before but he was never attracted to her physical beauty, else he would have married her, instead of insisting on her that she should marry Zaid."&lt;ref&gt;Siddiqi (1980), p. 163&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the English translation of the book, ''The Wives of the Messenger of Allah'' by Muhammad Swaleh Awadh, it states that she was married to Muhammad in Dhul Qa'adah, in the fifth year of [[Hijri year|Hijra]]. Since Zaynab was the wife of Muhammad's adopted son, pre-Islamic practices frowned upon such her marriage with the prophet.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, "Aisha bint Abu Bakr", [[Encyclopaedia of Islam]] Online&lt;/ref&gt;  Arab society would have viewed this union as profoundly wrong; because they considered an adopted son was truly a "son", for a man to marry his adopted son's wife—even if she was divorced—was considered wrong.&lt;ref&gt;"...the marriage of a man with the wife of his adopted son, even though divorced, was looked upon by the Arabs as a very wrong thing indeed." Sell, E. (1905). The Historical Development of the Quran (pp. 149–50). London: Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"This liberality did not prevent severe comments from those who regarded adopted sonship as real sonship—for which view Mohammed’s institution of brotherhoods gave some support—and who, therefore, regarded this union as incestuous." Margoliouth, D.S. (1905). Mohammed and the Rise of Islam (Third Edition., p. 321). New York: G.P. Putnam’s Sons.&lt;/ref&gt;

The marriage was used by [[Munafiq]]s of Medina to discredit Muhammad on two fronts, one of double standards as she was his fifth wife, while everyone else was restricted to four, and marrying his adopted son's wife. This was exactly what Muhammad feared and was initially hesitant in marrying her. The Qur'an, however, confirmed that this marriage was valid. Thus Muhammad, confident of his faith in the Qur'an, proceeded to reject the existing Arabic norms.&lt;ref&gt;Watt (1956), pp. 330–31&lt;/ref&gt; When Zaynab's waiting period from her divorce was complete, Muhammad married her.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, p. 156.&lt;/ref&gt;  In reference to this incident, [[Sura]] [[Al-Ahzab]] {{cite quran|33|37|style=nosup|expand=no}} says:

{{Quote|Behold! Thou didst say to one who had received the grace of Allah and thy favour: "Retain thou (in wedlock) thy wife, and fear Allah." But thou didst hide in thy heart that which Allah was about to make manifest: thou didst fear the people, but it is more fitting that thou shouldst fear Allah. Then when Zaid had dissolved (his marriage) with her, with the necessary (formality), We joined her in marriage to thee: in order that (in future) there may be no difficulty to the Believers in (the matter of) marriage with the wives of their adopted sons, when the latter have dissolved with the necessary (formality) (their marriage) with them. And Allah's command must be fulfilled.}}

After this verse was announced, Muhammad proceeded to reject the existing Arabic norms on the prohibition to marry the wives of adopted sons, which was considered extremely wrong and [[incest]]uous among Arabs.&lt;ref name="EI2"&gt;{{Cite encyclopedia | edition = 2nd| publisher = Brill Academic Publishers| volume = 11| pages = 475| last = Lecker| first = M | title = Zayd B.

[[Oriental studies|Orientalists]] and critics have pointed to this Sura as an example of a self-serving revelation that merely reflects Muhammad's own [[lust]] and [[sexual desire]]s rather than the will of God.&lt;ref name=JE1 /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"Being the wife of an adopted son, she was unlawful to the Prophet, but a pretended revelation (see Qur’ān, Sūrah xxxiii. 37) settled the difficulty, and Muḥammad married her. "Hughes, T.P. (1885). A Dictionary of Islam: Being a Cyclopædia of the Doctrines, Rites, Ceremonies, and Customs, together with the Technical and Theological Terms, of the Muhammadan Religion. London: W. H. Allen &amp; Co.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"However, Muhammad did this, and had to justify his action by alleging that he had for it the direct sanction of God. It was first necessary to show that God did not approve of the general objection to marriage with wives of adopted sons, and so the revelation came thus: Nor hath He made your adopted sons to be as your sons. – Súratu’l Ahzáb (33) v. 4. ...  Having thus settled the general principle, the way was clear for Muhammad to act in this particular case, and to claim divine sanction for setting at nought the sentiment of the Arab people. So the revelation goes on to say: And remember when thou (i.e. Muhammad) said to him (i.e. Zaid), unto whom God had shown favour1 and to whom thou also hadst shown favour, ‘Keep thy wife to thyself and fear God;’ and thou didst hide in thy mind what God would bring to light and thou didst fear man;3 but more right had it been to fear God. And when Zaid had settled to divorce her, we married her to thee, that it might not be a crime in the faithful to marry the wives of their adopted sons when they have settled the affairs concerning them. And the order of God is to be performed. No blame attaches to the Prophet where God hath given him a permission. – Súratu’l Ahzáb (33) vv. 37–38. This relaxation of the moral law for Muhammad’s benefit, because he was a prophet, shows how easy the divorce between religion and morality becomes in Islám." Sell, E. (1905). The Historical Development of the Quran (pp. 150–52). London: Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"But we learn the same lesson from all such investigations, and that is how completely Muḥammad adapted his pretended revelations to what he believed to be the need of the moment. The same thing is true with regard to what we read in Sûrah Al Aḥzâb regarding the circumstances attending his marriage with Zainab, whom his adopted son Zaid divorced for his sake. The subject is too unsavoury for us to deal with at any length, but a reference to what the Qur’ân itself (Sûrah XXXIII., 37) says about the matter, coupled with the explanations afforded by the Commentators and the Traditions, will prove that Muḥammad’s own character and disposition have left their mark upon the moral law of Islâm and upon the Qur’ân itself." Tisdall, W.S.C. (1911). The Original Sources of the Qur’ân (pp. 278–79). London: Society for Promoting Christian Knowledge.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;"But at Medina he seems to have cast off all shame; and the incidents connected with his marital relations, more especially the story of his marriage with Zainab the wife of his adopted son Zaid, and his connexion with Mary the Coptic slave-girl, are sufficient proof of his unbridled licentiousness and of his daring impiety in venturing to ascribe to GOD Most High the verses which he composed to sanction such conduct."

We hear of no doubts or questionings; and we can only attribute the confiding and credulous spirit of his followers to the absolute ascendancy of his powerful mind over all who came within its influence."

===Religious syncretism and compromise===
[[John Mason Neale]] (1818–1866) accused Muhammad of pandering to his followers, arguing that he constructed Islam out of a mixture of beliefs that provided something for everyone.&lt;ref name="Neale 1847 V.II p.68"&gt;[[John Mason Neale|Neale, J.M.]] (1847). A History of the Holy Eastern Church: The Patriarchate of Alexandria. London: Joseph Masters. Volume II, Section I "Rise of Mahometanism" (p. 68)&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|That Mahomet was not the enthusiast which some semi-infidel or latitudinarian authors have considered him, is evident from the ingenuity with which, while he panders to the passions of his followers, he also infuses into his religion so much of each of those tenets to which the varying sects of his countrymen were addicted, as to enable each and all to please themselves by the belief that the new doctrine was only a reform of, and improvement on, that to which they had been accustomed. The Christians were conciliated by the acknowledgment of our LORD as the Greatest of Prophets; the Jews, by the respectful mention of Moses and their other Lawgivers; the idolaters, by the veneration which the Impostor professed for the Temple of Mecca, and the black stone which it contained; and the Chaldeans, by the pre-eminence which he gives to the ministrations of the Angel Gabriel, and his whole scheme of the Seven Heavens. To a people devoted to the gratification of their passions and addicted to Oriental luxury, he appealed, not unsuccessfully, by the promise of a Paradise whose sensual delights were unbounded, and the permission of a free exercise of pleasures in this world.&lt;ref name="Neale 1847 V.II p.68"/&gt;}}

[[Thomas Patrick Hughes]] (b. 1838) argued that the [[Hajj]] represents an expedient compromise between Muhammad's [[Tawhid|monotheistic principles]] and [[Arabian mythology|Arabian paganism]].&lt;ref name="Hughes 1885 p. 159"/&gt;

{{quote|The Makkan pilgrimage admits of no other explanation than this, that the Prophet of Arabia found it expedient to compromise with Arabian idolatry. And hence we find the superstition and silly customs of the Ḥajj grafted on to a religion which professes to be both monotheistic in its principle, and iconoclastic in its practices.
A careful and critical study of Islām will, we think, convince any candid mind that at first Muḥammad intended to construct his religion on the lines of the Old Testament. Abraham, the true Muslim, was his prototype, Moses his law-giver, and Jerusalem his Qiblah. But circumstances were ever wont to change not only the Prophet’s revelations, but also his moral standards. Makkah became the Qiblah; and the spectacle of the Muslim world bowing in the direction of a black stone, whilst they worship the one God, marks Islām, with its Makkan pilgrimage; as a religion of compromise.
Apologists of Islām have endeavoured to shield Muḥammad from the solemn charge of having “forged the name of God,” but we know of nothing which can justify the act of giving the stupid and unmeaning ceremonies of the pilgrimage all the force and solemnity of a divine enactment.&lt;ref name="Hughes 1885 p. 159"&gt;Hughes, T.P.

[[Ulama|Islamic scholar]] [[Yasir Qadhi]] stated that while non-Muslims believe Muhammad "adopted certain things from paganism and then added his own two cents for us", he instead states that Muhammad resurrected the original teachings of the [[Prophets and messengers in Islam|Islamic prophet]] [[Abraham in Islam|Ibrahim]], citing an Islamic narrative of a man named [[Amr Ibn Luhay]] who [[Banu Khuza'a#Rule of the Banu Khuza'ah over Mecca|later introduced paganism in Arabia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Yasir Qadhi|title=Seerah of Prophet Muhammed 4 – Religious status of the world before Islam |date=2012-07-23|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ey7UAi_Emgs&amp;feature=youtu.be&amp;t=4m55s|access-date=2018-09-30}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;Al-Azraqī: Akhbār Makkah.

===Psychological and medical condition===
[[File:BroerJansz1640Mahomet6.jpg|thumb|Muhammad depicted as having a seizure (1640)]]
[[File:Humphrey Prideaux.jpg|thumb|left|upright|[[Humphrey Prideaux]], engraving by [[John Simon (engraver)|John Simon]]]]
Muhammad is reported to have had mysterious seizures at the moments of inspiration.  According to [[Philip Schaff]] (1819–1893), during his revelations Muhammad "sometimes growled like a camel, foamed at his mouth, and streamed with perspiration."&lt;ref name="Schaff 1910 4.III.42"/&gt; Welch, a scholar of Islamic studies, in the [[Encyclopedia of Islam]] states that the graphic descriptions of Muhammad's condition at these moments may be regarded as genuine, since they are unlikely to have been invented by later Muslims. According to Welch, these seizures should have been the most convincing evidence for the superhuman origin of Muhammad's inspirations for people around him. Others adopted alternative explanations for these seizures and claimed that he was possessed, a soothsayer, or a magician. Welch states it remains uncertain whether Muhammad had such experiences before he began to see himself as a prophet and if so how long did he have such experiences.&lt;ref&gt;[[Encyclopedia of Islam]] online, Muhammad article&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Temkin, the first attribution of ''[[epileptic]]'' seizures to Muhammad comes from the 8th century Byzantine historian [[Theophanes the Confessor|Theophanes]] who wrote that Muhammad’s wife "was very much grieved that she, being of noble descent, was tied to such a man, who was not only poor but epileptic as well."&lt;ref name="Freemon"/&gt; In the Middle Ages, the general perception of those who suffered epilepsy was an unclean and incurable wretch who might be possessed by the Devil. The political hostility between Islam and Christianity contributed to the continuation of the accusation of epilepsy throughout the Middle Ages.&lt;ref name="Freemon"/&gt; The Christian minister Archdeacon [[Humphrey Prideaux]] gave the following description of Muhammad's visions:&lt;ref name="Freemon"/&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt; He pretended to receive all his revelations from the [[Gabriel|Angel Gabriel]], and that he
was sent from God of purpose to deliver them unto him. And whereas he was subject to the falling-sickness, whenever the fit was upon him, he pretended it to be a Trance, and that the Angel Gabriel comes from God with some Revelations unto him.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[File:Vasily Perov - Портрет Ф.М.Достоевского - Google Art Project.jpg|thumb|upright|A portrait of [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] in 1872, painted by [[Vasily Perov]]]]
Some modern Western scholars also have a skeptical view of Muhammad's seizures. Frank R. Freemon states Muhammad had "conscious control over the course of the spells and can pretend to be in a religious trance."&lt;ref name="Freemon"&gt;Frank R. Freemon, A [[Differential diagnosis|Differential Diagnosis]] of the Inspirational Spells of Muhammad the Prophet of Islam, Journal of Epilepsia, 17:4 23–427, 1976&lt;/ref&gt; During the nineteenth century, as Islam was no longer a political or military threat to Western society, and perceptions of epilepsy changed, the theological and moral associations with epilepsy were removed; epilepsy was now viewed as a medical disorder.&lt;ref name="Freemon"/&gt; Nineteenth-century orientalist Margoliouth claimed that Muhammad suffered from epilepsy and even occasionally faked it for effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Margoliouth | first=David Samuel | title=Mohammed and the Rise of Islam | year=1905 | publisher=Putnam | page=46}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sprenger attributes [[Muhammad's first revelation|Muhammad's revelations]] to [[epilepsy|epileptic fits]] or a "[[paroxysmal attacks|paroxysm]] of [[catalepsis|cataleptic]] [[insanity]]."&lt;ref name="Oussani"/&gt; In Schaff's view, Muhammad's "early and frequent epileptic fits" provided "some light on his revelations."&lt;ref name="Schaff 1910 4.III.42"/&gt;  The most famous epileptic of the 19th century, [[Fyodor Dostoyevsky]] (1821–1881) wrote that epileptic attacks have an inspirational quality; he said they are “a supreme exaltation of emotional subjectivity” in which time stands still. Dostoyevsky claimed that his own attacks were similar to those of Muhammad: "Probably it was of such an instant, that the epileptic Mahomet was speaking when he said that he had visited all the dwelling places of Allah within a shorter time than it took for his pitcher full of water to empty itself."&lt;ref name="Freemon"/&gt;

In an essay that discusses views of Muhammad's psychology, Franz Bul (1903) is said to have observed that "hysterical natures find unusual difficulty and often complete inability to distinguish the false from the true", and to have thought this to be "the safest way to interpret the strange inconsistencies in the life of the Prophet." In the same essay Duncan Black Macdonald (1911) is credited with the opinion that "fruitful investigation of the Prophet's life (should) proceed upon the assumption that he was fundamentally a pathological case."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Jeffery | first=Arthur | title=The Quest for the Historical Muhammad | year=2000 | publisher=Prometheus Books | isbn=978-1573927871 | page=346}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern Western scholars of Islam have rejected the diagnosis of epilepsy.&lt;ref name="Freemon"/&gt; [[Tor Andrae]] rejects the idea that the inspired state is pathological attributing it to a scientifically superficial and hasty theory arguing that those who consider Muhammad epileptic should consider all types of semi-conscious and trance-like states, occasional loss of consciousness, and similar conditions as epileptic attacks. Andrae writes that "[i]f epilepsy is to denote only those severe attacks which involve serious consequences for the physical and mental health, then the statement that Mohammad suffered from epilepsy must be emphatically rejected." [[Caesar Farah]] suggests that "[t]hese insinuations resulted from the 19th-century infatuation with scientifically superficial theories of medical psychology."&lt;ref&gt;See:
* Caesar Farah, "Islam: Beliefs and Observances" (2003), Barron's Educational Series, {{ISBN|0764122266}}
* Tor Andrae, Mohammad: The Man and his Faith, trans. Theophil Menzel (New York: Harper Torch Book Series, 1960), p. 51&lt;/ref&gt; Noth, in the ''Encyclopedia of Islam'', states that such accusations were a typical feature of medieval European Christian polemic.&lt;ref&gt;Muhammad, ''Encyclopedia of Islam''.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Maxime Rodinson]] says that it is most probable that Muhammad's conditions was basically of the same kind as that found in many mystics rather than epilepsy.&lt;ref&gt;Maxime Rodinson, Muhammad: Prophet of Islam, p. 56&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fazlur Rahman]] refutes epileptic fits for the following reasons: Muhammad's condition begins with his career at the age of 40; according to the tradition seizures are ''invariably'' associated with the revelation and never occur by itself. Lastly, a sophisticated society like the Meccan or Medinese would have identified epilepsy clearly and definitely.&lt;ref&gt;[[Fazlur Rahman]], ''Islam'', [[University of Chicago Press]], p. 13&lt;/ref&gt;

William Montgomery Watt also disagrees with the epilepsy diagnosis, saying that "there are no real grounds for such a view." Elaborating, he says that "epilepsy leads to physical and mental degeneration, and there are no signs of that in Muhammad." He then goes further and states that Muhammad was psychologically sound in general: "he (Muhammad) was clearly in full possession of his faculties to the very end of his life." Watt concludes by stating "It is incredible that a person subject to epilepsy, or hysteria, or even ungovernable fits of emotion, could have been the active leader of military expeditions, or the cool far-seeing guide of a city-state and a growing religious community; but all this we know Muhammad to have been."&lt;ref&gt;See:

Frank R. Freemon (1976) thinks that the above reasons given by modern biographers of Muhammad in rejection of epilepsy come from the widespread misconceptions about the various types of epilepsy.&lt;ref name="Freemon"/&gt; In his differential diagnosis, Freemon rejects schizophrenic hallucinations,&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Freemon starts his own differential diagnosis by arguing that "one must remember that Muhammad's inspired followers lived closely with him in his early and unsuccessful ministry; these same individuals demonstrated brilliant leadership of the explosively expanding Islamic state after his death". He thus rejects schizophrenic hallucinations thesis arguing that the [[blunted affect]] of the schizophrenic can hardly inspire the tenacious loyalty of the early followers. "It is also unlikely that a person with loose associations and other elements of schizophrenic [[thought disorder]] could guide the political and military fortunes of the early Islamic state."&lt;/ref&gt; drug-induced mental changes such as might occur after eating plants containing hallucinogenic materials,&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Freemon does so for two reasons: It can not justify the rapid, almost paroxysmal onset of these spells. Furthermore, without personal conviction of the reality of his visions, Muhammad could not have convinced his astute followers.&lt;/ref&gt; [[transient ischemic attack]]s,&lt;ref group=Note&gt;According to Freemon, "Too many of these spells occurred over too long a period of time to suggest transient ischemic attacks, and no neurologic deficits outside the mental sphere were observed."&lt;/ref&gt; [[hypoglycemia]],&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Freemon argues that long duration, absence of worsening, and paroxysmal onset make hypoglycemia unlikely&lt;/ref&gt; [[labyrinthitis]], [[Ménière's disease]], or other [[inner ear]] maladies.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;He argues that absence of vertigo rules out labyrinthitis, Meniere's disease, or other inner ear maladies.&lt;/ref&gt; At the end, Freemon argues that if one were forced to make a diagnosis psychomotor seizures of [[temporal lobe epilepsy]] would be the most tenable one, although our lack of scientific as well as historical knowledge makes unequivocal decision impossible. Freemon cites evidences supporting and opposing this diagnosis.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Supporting this diagnosis, he cites Paroxysmal onset, failing to the ground with loss of conscious, autonomic dysfunction and hallucinatory imagery. On the evidences opposing the diagnosis he mentions the late [[age of onset]], lack of recognition as seizures by his contemporaries, and lastly poetic, organized statements in immediate postictal period.&lt;/ref&gt; In the end, Freemon points out that a medical diagnosis should not ignore Muhammad’s moral message because it is just as likely, perhaps more likely, for God communicate with a person in an abnormal state of mind.&lt;ref group=Note&gt;Freemon explains this by quoting William James"Just as our primary wide-awake consciousness throws open our senses to the touch of things material, so it is logically conceivable that if there be higher spiritual agencies that can directly touch us, the psychological condition of their doing so might be our possession of a subconscious region which alone should yield access to them. The hubbub of the waking life might close a door which in the dreamy subliminal might remain ajar or open."&lt;/ref&gt;

From a Muslim point of view, Freemon says, Muhammed's mental state at the time of revelation was unique and is not therefore amenable to medical or scientific discourse.&lt;ref name="Freemon"/&gt; In reaction to Freemon's article, GM. S. Megahed, a Muslim neurologist criticized the article arguing that there are no scientific explanations for many religious phenomena, and that if Muhammad's message is a result of psychomotor seizures, then on the same basis Moses' and Jesus' message would be the result of psychomotor seizures. In response, Freemon attributed such negative reactions to his article to the general misconceptions about epilepsy as a demeaning condition. Freemon said that he did plan to write an article on the inspirational spells of [[Saint Paul (apostle)|St. Paul]], but the existence of such misconceptions caused him to cancel it.&lt;ref&gt;Letters to the Editor, Journal of Epilepsia. 18(2), 1977.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Criticism of Muhammad's personal motivations==

=== 19th century and early 20th century ===

William Muir, like many other 19th-century scholars divides Muhammad's life into two periods—[[Muhammad in Mecca|Meccan]] and [[Muhammad in Medina|Medinan]]. He asserts that "in the Meccan period of [Muhammad's] life there certainly can be traced no personal ends or unworthy motives," painting him as a man of good faith and a genuine reformer. However, that all changed after the ''[[Hijra (Islam)|Hijra]]'', according to Muir. "There [in Medina] temporal power, aggrandisement, and self-gratification mingled rapidly with the grand object of the Prophet's life, and they were sought and attained by just the same instrumentality." From that point on, he accuses Muhammad of manufacturing "messages from heaven" in order to justify a lust for women and reprisals against enemies, among other sins.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Muir | first=William | title=Life of Mahomet | year=1878 | publisher=Kessinger Publishing|isbn=978-0766177413 | page=583}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Philip Schaff]] says that "in the earlier part of his life he [Muhammad] was a sincere reformer and enthusiast, but after the establishment of his kingdom a slave of ambition for conquest" and describes him as "a slave of sensual passion."&lt;ref name="Schaff 1910 4.III.42"&gt;Schaff, P., &amp; Schaff, D.S.

{{quote|But at Medina he seems to have cast off all shame; and the incidents connected with his marital relations, more especially the story of his marriage with Zainab the wife of his adopted son Zaid, and his connexion with Mary the Coptic slave-girl, are sufficient proof of his unbridled licentiousness and of his daring impiety in venturing to ascribe to GOD Most High the verses which he composed to sanction such conduct.&lt;ref name="Tisdall 2895 p177"/&gt;}}

[[David Samuel Margoliouth|D.S. Margoliouth]], another 19th-century scholar, sees Muhammad as a charlatan who beguiled his followers with techniques like those used by fraudulent [[medium (spirituality)|mediums]] today. He has expressed a view that Muhammad faked his religious sincerity, playing the part of a messenger from [[God]] like a man in a play, adjusting his performances to create an illusion of [[spirituality]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Margoliouth | first=David Samuel | title=Mohammed and the Rise of Islam | pages=88–89, 104–06 | year=1905|publisher=Putnam}}&lt;/ref&gt; Margoliouth is especially critical of the character of Muhammad as revealed in [[Ibn Ishaq|Ibn Ishaq's]] famous biography, which he holds as especially telling because Muslims cannot dismiss it as the writings of an enemy:

{{quote|
In order to gain his ends he (Muhammad) recoils from no expedient, and he approves of similar unscrupulousness on the part of his adherents, when exercised in his interest. He profits to the utmost from the chivalry of the Meccans, but rarely requites it with the like... For whatever he does he is prepared to plead the express authorization of the deity. It is, however, impossible to find any doctrine which he is not prepared to abandon in order to secure a political end.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| last=Margoliouth | first=David Samuel | title=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics (Volume 8) | year=1926 | publisher=[[T&amp;T Clark]] | isbn=978-0567094896 | page=878| title-link=Encyclopedia of Religion and Ethics }}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

=== Late 20th century ===

According to [[William Montgomery Watt]] and Richard Bell, recent writers have generally dismissed the idea that Muhammad deliberately deceived his followers, arguing that Muhammad “was absolutely sincere and acted in complete good faith”.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, Bell (1995) p. 18&lt;/ref&gt; Modern secular historians generally decline to address the question of whether the messages Muhammad reported being revealed to him were from "his unconscious, the collective unconscious functioning in him, or from some divine source", but they acknowledge that the material came from "beyond his [[Consciousness|conscious mind]]."&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of Islam (1970), Cambridge University Press, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt; Watt says that sincerity does not directly imply correctness: In contemporary terms, Muhammad might have mistaken for divine revelation his own unconscious.&lt;ref&gt;Watt, Muhammad Prophet and Statesman, p. 17&lt;/ref&gt; William Montgomery Watt states:

{{quote|
Only a profound belief in himself and his mission explains Muhammad's readiness to endure hardship and persecution during the Meccan period when from a secular point of view there was no prospect of success. Without sincerity how could he have won the allegiance and even devotion of men of strong and upright character like Abu-Bakr and 'Umar ? ... There is thus a strong case for holding that Muhammad was sincere. If in some respects he was mistaken, his mistakes were not due to deliberate lying or imposture&lt;ref name="Watt1"&gt;Watt, Montgomery, ''Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman.'' Oxford University Press, 1961. From p. 232.&lt;/ref&gt;....the important point is that the message was not the product of Muhammad's conscious mind. He believed that he could easily distinguish between his own thinking and these revelations. His sincerity in this belief must be accepted by the modern historian, for this alone makes credible the development of a great religion. The further question, however, whether the messages came from Muhammad's unconscious, or the collective unconscious functioning in him, or from some divine source, is beyond the competence of the historian.&lt;ref&gt;The Cambridge History of Islam (1970), Cambridge University Press, p. 30&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Rudi Paret agrees, writing that "Muhammad was not a deceiver,"&lt;ref&gt;Minou Reeves, Muhammad in Europe, New York University Press, p. 6, 2000&lt;/ref&gt; and Welch also holds that "the really powerful factor in Muhammad’s life and the essential clue to his extraordinary success was his unshakable belief from beginning to end that he had been called by God. A conviction such as this, which, once firmly established, does not admit of the slightest doubt, exercises an incalculable influence on others. The certainty with which he came forward as the executor of God’s will gave his words and ordinances an authority that proved finally compelling."&lt;ref&gt;Encyclopedia of Islam, ''Muhammad''&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Bernard Lewis]], another modern historian, commenting on the common Western Medieval view of Muhammad as a self-seeking impostor, states that&lt;ref&gt;[[The Arabs in History]], Lewis, pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt;

{{quote|The modern historian will not readily believe that so great and significant a movement was started by a self-seeking impostor. Nor will he be satisfied with a purely supernatural explanation, whether it postulates aid of divine or diabolical origin; rather, like Gibbon, will he seek 'with becoming submission, to ask not indeed what were the first, but what were the secondary causes of the rapid growth' of the new faith.}}

Watt rejects the idea that Muhammad's moral behavior deteriorated after he migrated to Medinia. He argues that "it is based on too facile a use of the principle that all power corrupts and absolute power corrupts absolutely". Watt interprets incidents in the Medinan period in such a way that they mark "no failure in Muhammad to live to his ideals and no lapse from his moral principles."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Watt | first=W. Montgomery | url=http://www.fordham.edu/halsall/med/watt.html | title=Muhammad: Prophet and Statesman | page=229 | year=1961 | publisher= [[Oxford University Press]] | isbn=978-0198810780}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2978">'''Denburg Edison Clifford Coleman''' (January 8, 1931 – February 6, 1994) was a radio pioneer, comedian and journalist. He worked primarily with [[Radio Belize]] and is recognized as having brought that station to a position of prominence in the small Central American nation.

== Biography ==
Coleman was born in [[Benque Viejo del Carmen]] to descendants of Honduran immigrants from Isla Roatan. Having attended primary school in Benque Viejo and [[St. John's College, Belize|high school in Belize City]], he became involved in the nationalist movement on the labour front, working with [[George Cadle Price|George Price]] and the [[General Workers' Union (Belize)|General Workers' Union]] in the 1950s. He had also gotten a part-time job with Radio Belize as a temporary announcer, at first working only in Spanish because the bosses thought he did not have the right accent for delivering an English-language newscast. 
He received a certificate and a job as Labor Inspector but was fired a few months later after an altercation with a fellow employee. He fell back on his job at Radio Belize and within a decade had risen to become the voice of Belize, with a sometimes risque repartee of jokes and witticisms and a ready supply of listener approved music. About this time he married childhood sweetheart Carmen "Panchita" Aguallo; they had one son, current broadcaster with [[Positive Vibes FM]] Gerard Coleman. He also had a step granddaughter, Susan Hernandez, whom he loved very much like his own blood granddaughter. He often let her speak over the radio and pick songs for the playlist. Coleman also frequently performed at the former Bliss Institute, now Center for the Performing Arts. He died in 1994, at Radio Belize's ebb in [[Belize City]], [[Belize]], prior to the station's demise in 1998.

== Radio style ==
Coleman was termed a perfectionist by some of his coworkers. But he always kept them- and listeners- on edge with his own brand of humor, much of it focused on unseen companion "Panchita", which many listeners thought represented his wife, though this was not the case. Among several bad habits was his lack of judgement with regard to time, some mornings barely making it to studios in downtown Belize City; and his rampant alcoholism, which only after several scares was repudiated in the late 1970s. Coleman succeeded because he represented the resiliency of Belizeans in the face of the many disasters affecting the nation as it struggled toward independence.

'''Erik Rhodes''' (born '''James Elliott Naughtin'''; February 8, 1982 – June 14, 2012) was an [[Coming out|openly gay]] American 
gay [[pornographic film actor]], under an exclusive contract with [[Falcon Studios]]. He played [[versatile (sex)|versatile]] roles in videos and in his private sex life. He was also notable in New York's gay nightlife and social circles; Rhodes used to date fashion designer [[Marc Jacobs]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://gawker.com/354989/marc-jacobs-porn-star-pal-needs-to-shut-up ''Marc Jacobs' Porn Star Pal Needs To Shut Up''] {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130125063612/http://gawker.com/354989/marc-jacobs-porn-star-pal-needs-to-shut-up |date=January 25, 2013 }} from ''[[Gawker]]'' February 11, 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

Rhodes made his struggles with drugs and depression public for years. He was a blogger and frequently wrote of his heavy usage of both club drugs and bodybuilding steroids. He died in his sleep from a [[cardiac arrest]] on June 14, 2012.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/2012/06/21/fashion/erik-rhodess-death-was-early-but-perhaps-not-surprising.html ''An Early Death but Perhaps Not a Surprise''] from ''[[The New York Times]]'' June 20, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; He was [[Cremation|cremated]] per his family's request.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.moloneyfh.com/obituaries/2012/james-naughtin ''Moloney Funeral Home: James Naughtin''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120620193017/http://www.moloneyfh.com/obituaries/2012/james-naughtin |date=June 20, 2012 }} from ''www.moloneyfh.com'' June 15, 2012&lt;/ref&gt; Rhodes's [[HIV/AIDS in the pornographic film industry|HIV positive]] status revelation posthumously in ''[[The New York Times]]'' generated controversy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://blogs.poz.com/oriol/archives/2012/06/erik_rhodes_hiv.html ''Posthumous HIV Disclosure Stirs Debate''] from ''[[POZ (magazine)|POZ magazine]]'' June 22, 2012&lt;/ref&gt;

She starred in a 1988 commercial for the perfume Exclamation by [[Coty, Inc.]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Famke Janssen Exclamation perfume commercial | via = YouTube | url = https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QZVWblJ2utI | accessdate = 16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her looks have been compared to [[Hedy Lamarr]] and other 1940s films stars.&lt;ref name="NYTimesArticle1"/&gt;

After retiring from modelling in the early 1990s, Janssen had guest roles on several television series, including a starring role in the 1992 ''[[Star Trek: The Next Generation]]'' episode "[[The Perfect Mate]]", as empathic metamorph Kamala, opposite [[Patrick Stewart]], with whom she later starred in the ''X-Men'' film series.&lt;ref name="NYTimesArticle1"/&gt; That same year, Janssen was offered the role of [[Jadzia Dax]] in ''[[Star Trek: Deep Space Nine]]'' but turned it down to pursue film roles.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Famke Janssen|url=http://www.buddytv.com/info/famke-janssen-info.aspx|work=[[BuddyTV]]|accessdate=23 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; Her first film role was alongside [[Jeff Goldblum]] in the 1992 crime drama film ''[[Fathers &amp; Sons (film)|Fathers &amp; Sons]]''.

===1990s===
[[File:FamkeeJanssenOct08.jpg|thumb|upright|Janssen in October 2008]]
In 1995, Janssen appeared in [[Pierce Brosnan]]'s first [[James Bond]] film, ''GoldenEye'', as [[femme fatale]] Xenia Onatopp. She also appeared in ''[[Lord of Illusions]]'' with [[Scott Bakula]]. In an attempt to fight against [[typecasting (acting)|typecasting]] after her [[Bond girl]] performance, Janssen began seeking out more intriguing support roles, appearing in [[John Irvin]]'s ''[[City of Industry (film)|City of Industry]]'', [[Woody Allen]]'s ''[[Celebrity (film)|Celebrity]]'', [[Robert Altman]]'s ''[[The Gingerbread Man (film)|The Gingerbread Man]]'', and [[Ted Demme]]'s ''[[Monument Ave.]]''&lt;ref name="tavissmiley"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200805/20080506_janssen.html |accessdate=16 October 2011 |title=Famke Janssen on ''Tavis Smiley'' |work=[[PBS]] |date=6 May 2008  |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100523213246/http://www.pbs.org/kcet/tavissmiley/archive/200805/20080506_janssen.html |archivedate=23 May 2010 }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Denis Leary]], her co-star in ''Monument Ave.'', was impressed by how easily she blended in, initially not recognizing her as she was already in character.&lt;ref name="NYTimesArticle1"/&gt; In the late 1990s, she also appeared in ''[[The Faculty]]'', ''[[Rounders (1998 film)|Rounders]]'', ''[[Deep Rising]]'', and ''[[House on Haunted Hill (1999 film)|House on Haunted Hill]]''.

===''X-Men'' films===
In 2000, Janssen played [[superhero]] Dr. Jean Grey in the [[Marvel Studios]] film ''[[X-Men (film)|X-Men]]''. She later reprised the role in the 2003 sequel, ''[[X2 (film)|X2]]'' where her character shows signs of increasing powers but at the end of the film, she is presumably killed. Janssen returns as a very much alive Jean whose death in ''X2'' awoke her dark alternate personality, [[Phoenix Force (comics)|Phoenix]] in ''[[X-Men: The Last Stand]]'' (2006). At the end of the film, she is killed by Wolverine (played by [[Hugh Jackman]]), who only does it because Jean asks him to, not wanting to hurt anyone when Phoenix is in control. For that role, she won a [[Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress]].&lt;ref name="newnetherlandinstitute2"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.newnetherlandinstitute.org/history-and-heritage/dutch_americans/famke-janssen/ |title=Famke Janssen  [1965] Stage and Screen Performer |publisher=New Netherland Institute |accessdate=2 May 2016 |quote=In 2007 she won three awards, the Saturn Award for Best Supporting Actress...}}&lt;/ref&gt; She returned as Jean in the 2013 film ''[[The Wolverine (film)|The Wolverine]]'' as a hallucination of Wolverine's.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Robert Yaniz Jr.|title=‘The Wolverine’: Hugh Jackman on Jean Grey’s Return|url=http://screenrant.com/wolverine-hugh-jackman-jean-grey-famke-janssen/|work=Screen Rant|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Janssen reprised her role of Jean Grey in a brief cameo for ''[[X-Men: Days of Future Past (film)|X-Men: Days of Future Past]]'', as did a few of the original actors from the first three films including [[Halle Berry]], [[Kelsey Grammer]], [[Anna Paquin]] and [[James Marsden]]. In the film, Wolverine went back in time and changed the course of the future, the result being that the events of the third movie, including the deaths of Jean Grey and Cyclops, never happened.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Rob Keyes|title=Famke Janssen on ‘X-Men: Days of Future Past’ Return: ‘Stay Tuned’|url=http://screenrant.com/x-men-days-of-future-past-famke-janssen-jean-grey/|work=Screen Rant|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|first=Marc|last=Malkin|title=X-Men: How Famke Janssen Kept Her Days of Future Past Cameo a Secret|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/546666/x-men-how-famke-janssen-kept-her-days-of-future-past-cameo-a-secret|work=[[E!

===2002–present===
[[File:Famke Janssen by Gage Skidmore (2) (cropped).jpg|thumb|upright|Janssen at the 2013 WonderCon]]
In 2002, Janssen landed the role of villainess Serleena in ''[[Men in Black II]]'', but had to abandon the film due to a death in her family and was replaced by [[Lara Flynn Boyle]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://variety.com/2001/film/news/inside-move-janssen-out-of-mib-2-1117803054/ |title=Inside Move: Janssen out of ‘MIB:2’ |accessdate=November 27, 2017 |last=Brodesser |first= Claude|date=July 18, 2001 |work= [[Variety (magazine)|Variety]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition, Janssen had a prominent role in the second season of the popular TV series ''[[Nip/Tuck]]'', as the seductive and manipulative [[life coach]] [[Ava Moore]], which earned her Hollywood Life's Breakthrough Artist of the Year Award.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gettyimages.com/detail/video/famke-janssen-at-the-hollywood-life-magazines-news-footage/75783322|title=Famke Janssen at the Hollywood Life Magazine's Breakthrough of the...|publisher=Getty Images}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reprised her role in the final two episodes of the series.

In 2007, she starred in ''[[Turn the River]]'', for which she was awarded the Special Recognition Best Actress Award at the [[Hamptons International Film Festival]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = 2007 Hamptons International Film Festival Awards | website = HamptonsFilmFest.org | date = 4 January 2008 | url = http://hamptonsfilmfest.org/2008/01/2007-hamptons-international-film-festival-awards/ | accessdate = 16 October 2011 | deadurl = yes | archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20110930060723/http://hamptonsfilmfest.org/2008/01/2007-hamptons-international-film-festival-awards/ | archivedate = 30 September 2011 | df = dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  The following year, she starred in [[Luc Besson]]'s ''Taken''. Janssen also continued to work in television, appearing in TV pilots for [[NBC]]'s cop drama ''Winters'' and [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]'s ''The Farm'', a spinoff of ''[[The L Word]]'' set in a women's prison. Both pilots were rejected by their respective networks. Janssen also provided the [[Dutch language]] narration for the Studio Tram Tour at all [[The Walt Disney Company|Disney]] theme parks.&lt;ref name="tavissmiley"/&gt;

In 2011, Janssen made her directorial début with the drama ''[[Bringing Up Bobby (2011 film)|Bringing Up Bobby]]''. She also wrote the screenplay to the film, which stars [[Milla Jovovich]], [[Bill Pullman]] and [[Marcia Cross]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | first = Joan | last = Gilmore | title = Around Town: Bobby crew at JRB gallery | newspaper = The Journal Record | date = 5 August 2010 | url = http://journalrecord.com/2010/08/05/around-town-bobby-opinion/ | accessdate = 16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; She reprised her role as Lenore Mills in ''[[Taken 2]]'' (2012) and ''[[Taken 3]]'' (2014). She starred as the main villain Muriel in ''[[Hansel and Gretel: Witch Hunters]]'' (2013).

Janssen has starred in the [[Netflix Original Programing|Netflix original]] [[horror fiction|horror]] [[thriller fiction|thriller]] television series ''[[Hemlock Grove (TV series)|Hemlock Grove]]'' since 2013 where she plays the role of family matriarch Olivia Godfrey.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author1=Gina McIntyre|title=‘Hemlock Grove’ first look: Famke Janssen, Bill Skarsgard in Season 2|url=http://herocomplex.latimes.com/tv/hemlock-grove-first-look-famke-janssen-bill-skarsgard-in-season-2/|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=27 May 2014|accessdate=24 June 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Janssen was cast in a starring role in the NBC crime thriller, ''[[The Blacklist: Redemption]]'', a spinoff of the NBC series ''[[The Blacklist (TV series)|The Blacklist]]'', in March 2016;&lt;ref name="Spinoff"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://deadline.com/2016/03/the-blacklist-spinoff-famke-janssen-star-nbc-1201728137/|title=''The Blacklist'' Spinoff Starring Famke Janssen In the Works At NBC|last=Andreeva|first=Nellie|work=[[Deadline Hollywood]]|date=29 March 2016|accessdate=29 March 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; it was picked up to series in May 2016.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Nellie|last=Andreeva |url=http://deadline.com/2016/05/the-blacklist-redemption-spinoff-series-cruel-intentions-nbc-title-1201755724/ |title=The Blacklist Spinoff Picked Up To Series, NBC, Cruel Intentions Alive |work=[[Deadline Hollywood]] |date=14 May 2016 |accessdate=16 May 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Personal life and activism ==
Janssen was married to writer and director [[Tod Williams (filmmaker)|Kip Williams]], son of architect [[Tod Williams Billie Tsien Architects|Tod Williams]], from 1995 to 2000.&lt;ref name="FR-bio"/&gt;

Janssen appeared with her dog, Licorice, a [[brindle]] [[Boston Terrier]], in a 2007 [[People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals|PETA]] campaign to raise awareness for animal rights. The campaign used the slogan "Be an Angel for Animals."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = Famke Janssen Is an Angel for Animals | publisher= [[PETA]] | url = http://www.peta2.com/OUTTHERE/o-famke.asp | accessdate = 16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 28 January 2008, she was appointed a [[Goodwill Ambassador|Goodwill Ambassador for Integrity]] for the [[United Nations Office on Drugs and Crime]] at a United Nations anti-corruption conference held in [[Nusa Dua]], [[Bali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | title = UN Anti-Corruption Conference Opens in Bali | publisher = United Nations Information Service Vienna | date = 28 January 2008 | url = http://www.unis.unvienna.org/unis/pressrels/2008/unisnar1021.html | accessdate = 16 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, Janssen showed frustration in not being cast in the new ''X-Men'' movie ''[[X-Men: Apocalypse]]'' saying Hollywood was sexist towards older women.&lt;ref name="Janssen's frustration"&gt;{{cite journal |last=Child |first=Ben |title=Jansen said she could not understand why other X-men actors have been given older versions of themselves |url=https://www.theguardian.com/film/2016/apr/25/famke-janssen-x-men-replacement |journal= |location= |work=[[The Guardian]] |date=25 April 2016 |access-date= 25 April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; She said “Women, it’s interesting because they’re replaced, and the older versions are never to be seen again... whereas the men are allowed to be both ages.”&lt;ref name="Janssen's frustration"/&gt;

'''Gregorio Ballesteros Honasan II''' (born March 14, 1948), better known as '''Gringo Honasan''', is a retired [[Philippine Army]] officer who led unsuccessful [[coup d'état|coups d'état]] against President [[Corazon Aquino]]. He played a key role in the [[1986 EDSA Revolution]] that toppled President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].

After 1986, he led a series of unsuccessful but violent coup attempts against the administration of [[Corazon Aquino]]. President [[Fidel Ramos]] granted him amnesty in 1992. He entered politics and became a [[Philippine Senator|senator]] from 1995 to 2004 and again since 2007. He ran for vice president of the Philippines, being [[Jejomar Binay]]'s running-mate in 2016, but were defeated by [[Leni Robredo]] and [[Rodrigo Duterte]] respectively.

==Early life==
Gregorio Honasan was born in [[Baguio City]] to Colonel Romeo Gillego Honasan and Alicia "Alice" Masip Ballesteros, both from [[Sorsogon]] province.&lt;ref name="senate"&gt;[http://www.senate.gov.ph/senators/former_senators/gregorio_honasan.htm Senate of the Philippines - Gregorio Honasan]&lt;/ref&gt; Honasan spent his elementary days at [[San Beda College]] from Kindergarten to Grade 6. After which, he went to Taiwan and studied at the [[Dominican International School|Dominican School]], Taipei, Taiwan. He then returned to the Philippines and finished his high school at [[Don Bosco Technical College]]. He attained his [[Bachelor of Science]] degree at the [[Philippine Military Academy]], where he received the title of "Class Baron", the academy's highest leadership award.&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt;

==Military career==
After graduating in 1971, he joined the [[Armed Forces of the Philippines|Philippine Army's]] [[special forces]], [[Scout Ranger Regiment]] and went into combat against separatist and communist insurgents in [[Luzon]] and [[Mindanao]]. He was wounded in action at battles in [[Lebak, Sultan Kudarat|Lebak]] and [[Jolo, Sulu|Jolo]].&lt;ref name="senate"/&gt; Making his way up through the armed forces, he became [[aide-de-camp]] to Defense Minister [[Juan Ponce Enrile]] in 1974, and later became the Defense Ministry's Chief of Security.

Concurrent with his position as security chief, he was a board member of the Northern Mindanao Development Bank and president of the Beatriz Marketing Company.&lt;ref name="isite"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.i-site.ph/Databases/Congress/12thSenate/personal/honasan-personal.html |title=i-site.ph - Gregorio Honasan |access-date=2006-02-24 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051224205813/http://www.i-site.ph/Databases/Congress/12thSenate/personal/honasan-personal.html |archive-date=2005-12-24 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Political career==

===People Power===
&lt;!-- Deleted image removed: [[Image:EDSA heroes.jpg|thumb|left|300px|Defense Minister [[Juan Ponce Enrile]], Lt. Gen. [[Fidel Ramos]], Col. [[Gregorio Honasan|Gringo Honasan]], and other rebel soldiers during the height of the 1986 EDSA [[People Power Revolution]]]] --&gt;
In 1986, Honasan and a cabal of colonels, backed by Enrile, tried to use popular unrest to overthrow the [[dictatorship]] of President [[Ferdinand Marcos]].&lt;ref name="abs"&gt;[http://www.abs-cbnnews.com/storypage.aspx?StoryID=56268 Honasan: Anti-Marcos poster boy turned coup leader]{{dead link|date=October 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt; When the plot was uncovered, the conspirators sought refuge in the military headquarters and called on civilians, the media, and the [[Catholic Church]] for protection. Hundreds of thousands of people served as human shields to protect Honasan and his men from Marcos' forces, sparking the 1986 [[People Power Revolution]] that led to Marcos' fall from power and the installation of [[Corazon Aquino]] as president.

===Coups d'état===
{{regchangeRP}}
Aquino awarded Honasan a Distinguished Conduct Star for the EDSA Revolution and the Presidential Government Medal in 1986. Under the new government, he was head of a special group in the defense ministry. Using his position, he was covertly involved in various coup attempts against Aquino.&lt;ref name="abs"/&gt; On August 28, 1987, fighting broke out in the streets and Honasan ordered his men to attack government installations, resulting in the deaths of dozens, including many civilians. The attack was put down by government forces, but Honasan was able to escape. He was later captured and imprisoned on a Navy ship in [[Manila Bay]]. He later escaped once again by convincing his guards to join his cause.&lt;ref name="abs"/&gt;

===Senate===
{{main|Jejomar Binay presidential campaign, 2016}}

Philippine President [[Fidel Ramos]], who was elected in 1992, granted [[amnesty]] to his comrade Honasan. Honasan utilized his rebel infamy to enter politics in 1995, becoming the first independent candidate in Philippine history to win a seat in the [[Senate of the Philippines|Senate]]. He was re-elected in 2001, filled the vacant seat left by Senator [[Teofisto Guingona Jr.]], who was appointed by President [[Gloria Macapagal Arroyo]] as [[Vice President of the Philippines|Vice President]]. From April 30 to May 1, 2001, together with [[Juan Ponce Enrile]], [[Miriam Defensor Santiago]], [[Panfilo Lacson]] and [[Vicente Sotto III]], he led the [[EDSA III]] protests in support of [[Joseph Estrada]].&lt;ref &gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.philstar.com/headlines/90521/miriam-gma-resign-or-we-will-storm-palace|title= Miriam to GMA: Resign or we will storm palace

|publisher=''[[Rappler]]''|date=August 25, 2015|accessdate=April 27, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He left the Senate when the term expired in 2004.  In the [[Philippine general election, 2007|general election]] held in May 2007, he was again elected to the Senate.  Running as an [[Independent (politician)|independent candidate]], he polled some 11.6 million votes, finishing 10th out of 37 candidates for 12 Senate vacancies.  He took up his post on June 30. He was reelected during the [[Philippine Senate election, 2013|2013 elections]], placing twelfth, his fourth consecutive term.

On June 2015, Justice Undersecretary Justiniano amended the complaint against Senator Honasan for his alleged part in the [[Pork Barrel Scam]] involving allegations of corrupt malversation of public funds.

Following the alleged collapse of talks between UNA presidential candidate [[Jejomar Binay]] Honasan became Binay's running mate.

'''Howard Michael Mandel''' (born November 29, 1955) is a Canadian comedian, actor, and television host. He is known as host of the [[NBC]] game show ''[[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|Deal or No Deal]]'', as well as the show's [[Deal or No Deal (U.S. syndicated game show)|daytime]] and [[Deal or No Deal Canada|Canadian-English]] counterparts. In 1987, Mandel starred alongside [[Amy Steel]] in the comedy film ''[[Walk Like a Man (1987 film)|Walk Like a Man]]''. Before his career as a game show host, Mandel was best known for his role as rowdy ER intern Dr. Wayne Fiscus on the NBC medical drama ''[[St. Elsewhere]]''. He is also well known for being the creator and star of the children's cartoon ''[[Bobby's World]]'', as well as a judge on [[NBC]]'s ''[[America's Got Talent]]''.

==Early life==
Mandel was born and lived in the [[Willowdale, Toronto|Willowdale]] area of [[Toronto]], Ontario. He is [[Jewish]], and his ancestors emigrated from Romania and Poland. Mandel is also a distant cousin to violinist [[Itzhak Perlman]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jun/21/news/tv-61937 | title=New Afternoon Arrival | publisher=''Los Angeles Times'' | date=June 21, 1998 | accessdate=July 24, 2014 | author=Brownfield, Paul}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father was a lighting manufacturer and a real estate agent.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.filmreference.com/film/9/Howie-Mandel.html|title=Howie Mandel Biography (1955-)|website=www.filmreference.com|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandel was expelled from his high school ([[William Lyon Mackenzie Collegiate Institute]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://corp.gsn.com/bios/howie_mandell | title=Deal or No Deal Howie Mandell | publisher=''GSN Press Room'' | date=2006 | accessdate=May 22, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Dead link|date=January 2018}}) for impersonating a school official and hiring a construction company to build an addition to his school.&lt;ref name="cbc"&gt;{{cite web|title=Howie Mandel tours the playground|url=http://www.cbc.ca/archives/entry/howie-mandel-tours-the-playground|website=CBC Archives|publisher=CBC|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Afterwards, Mandel worked as a carpet salesman.&lt;ref name="cdn_encyclopedia"&gt;{{cite web|title=Howie Mandel|url=https://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.ca/en/article/howie-mandel/|website=The Canadian Encyclopedia|accessdate=26 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was a stand-up comedian at [[Yuk Yuk's]] in Toronto and by September 1978 had a week-long booking as featured act, billed as "a wild and crazy borderline [[psychosis|psychotic]]".&lt;ref&gt;[[Toronto Star]], September 12, 1978, p. D1&lt;/ref&gt; His repertoire included placing a latex glove over his head and inflating it by blowing through his nose, the fingers of the glove extending above his head like a [[Chicken crest|cockscomb]]. When the audience reacted uproariously to that and similar antics, his trademark response was to extend his arms palms up, look incredulous, and say, "it's you." His manager during the Yuk Yuk years was Canadian David Holiff who Mandel later fired. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://pgnewspapers.pgpl.ca/fedora/repository/pgc%3A1984-11-27-18/OCR/Full%20Text%20OCR|last=The Citizen|title=Canadian Performers: Holiff offers helping hand|date=27 November 1984|location=Prince George|accessdate=12 January 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On a trip to [[Los Angeles]], Mandel performed a set at [[The Comedy Store]], which resulted in his becoming a regular performer there. A producer for the comedic game show ''[[Make Me Laugh]]'' saw him and booked Mandel for several appearances during the show's run in 1979. He was booked to open for [[David Letterman]] at shows in the summer of 1979.&lt;ref&gt;[[Toronto Star]], July 19, 1979, p. C6&lt;/ref&gt; [[CBC-TV]]'s head of variety programming saw his performance in October 1979 and immediately signed him for a TV special. In 1980, he won the lead role in the Canadian movie ''[[Gas (1981 film)|Gas]]'', co-starring [[Susan Anspach]] and [[Donald Sutherland]]. Mandel was one of the first "VeeJays" to appear on [[Nickelodeon|Nickelodeon's]] music video series, ''[[Pop Clips]]''.

==TV and film career==
[[File:Howie Mandel at the 39th Emmy Awards.jpg|left|thumb|200px|Mandel at the 39th Emmy Awards in 1987]]

Mandel came to national attention in the US during a six-year run on ''[[St. Elsewhere]]'', starting in 1982 and playing the role of Dr. Wayne Fiscus, opposite the late [[Ed Flanders]], and [[Norman Lloyd (actor)|Norman Lloyd]], with whom he remains good friends as of 2015. While working as Dr. Fiscus, and continuing to work as a comedian, he also did movies, including his role as the voice of Gizmo in the 1984 hit ''[[Gremlins]]'' and its 1990 sequel ''[[Gremlins 2: The New Batch]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/55390/gremlins-and-gremlins-2-new-batch-hit-blu-ray-check-out-some-clips|title=Gremlins and Gremlins 2: The New Batch Hit Blu-ray! Check Out Some Clips - Dread Central|date=2012-05-09|website=Dread Central|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1985, Mandel made a cameo in the [[Michael J. Fox]] directed short "The Iceman Hummeth" which was subsequently broadcast on ''[[Late Night with David Letterman]]'' in November 1985. In 1986, he starred in ''[[A Fine Mess (film)|A Fine Mess]]'' alongside [[Ted Danson]]. He performed his stand-up comedy act in several cities (the ''Watusi Tour''), which was followed by his ''Watusi'' music video in 1987. For the first two seasons of ''[[Muppet Babies]]'', he voiced [[Bunsen Honeydew]], [[Animal (Muppet)|Animal]], and [[Skeeter (Muppet)|Skeeter]]. He starred alongside [[Amy Steel]] in the 1987 comedy film ''[[Walk Like a Man (1987 film)|Walk Like a Man]]''. He was also "Maurice" in the 1989 movie ''[[Little Monsters]]''. In 1990, he starred in the short-lived sitcom ''[[Good Grief (TV series)|Good Grief]]'' on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]]. He was also the creator and executive producer of the Emmy-nominated children's [[animated series]] ''[[Bobby's World]]'' (1990–1998), to which he supplied the voices of the title character and his father (using Howie's "normal" voice for Bobby's dad). ''Bobby's World'' ran for eight seasons on Fox and was later [[Television syndication|syndicated]]. 

1992 saw the weekly airing of his self-titled comedy show ''Howie'' with multiple guest stars such as [[Gilbert Gottfried]], [[Little Richard]], and [[Lita Ford]] as the in-house band guitarist. His character Bobby made a regular appearance on the show.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0103445/?ref_=nm_flmg_slf_184|publisher=IMDB|accessdate=November 2 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1994, Mandel voiced the lead character, Little Howie, of the video game ''[[Tuneland]]''. He starred in the sketch comedy series ''[[Howie Mandel's Sunny Skies]]'' in 1995 on [[Showtime (TV network)|Showtime]]. Mandel appeared in the 1995 [[Clint Black]] [[country music]] video "[[Summer's Comin']]". He played the lead role of the professor in the short-lived TV series ''[[The Amazing Live Sea Monkeys]]'', and guest-starred on a 1996 episode of the [[American Broadcasting Company|ABC]] TV series ''[[Lois &amp; Clark: The New Adventures of Superman]]'' as [[DC Comics]] [[supervillain]] [[Mister Mxyzptlk]]. In 1998, he hosted his own syndicated talk show, ''[[The Howie Mandel Show]]'', which was cancelled after one season. In 1999/2000, Mandel played "Jason" in the film ''[[Apocalypse III: Tribulation]]'', was the voice of Jack in the movie [[The Tangerine Bear]] in 2000, and in 2002 played the Sand Man in the movie ''[[Hansel and Gretel (2002 film)|Hansel and Gretel]]''. In 2006, he appeared as himself as a guest host in a [[parody]] of ''Deal or No Deal'' in the [[show-within-a-show]] of the TV series ''[[Studio 60 on the Sunset Strip]]''. In 2007, he guest-starred as himself in an episode of NBC's ''[[Medium (TV series)|Medium]]'', making a dream cameo of himself on ''Deal or No Deal.'' In that episode, he booted off the nighttime drama's protagonist for "cheating", since in the show he is a [[psychic]] medium and appeared to "know" the contents of the cases. Mandel plays his alter-ego, Phil Skorjanc, in most of his comedy shows and these are a fan favorite. Bobby also made a cameo appearance in a February 2007 episode of ''[[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|Deal or No Deal]]''. On a special 2-hour Christmas episode, first aired on December 25, 2007, Mandel delivered one line with Bobby's voice, as per request of the contestant.

Mandel's signature stunt as a stand-up comedian (besides his Bobby alter-ego) was stretching a [[latex glove]] over his head and inflating it with his nostrils, filling it until it suddenly propelled itself off his head. This trick also lent itself to the title and cover photo of his comedy album, ''Fits Like a Glove'' (1986). He eventually gave up the routine under doctor's orders after being diagnosed with a perforated sinus. However, in a cameo role as himself on ''[[My Name is Earl]]'', he did the routine. He guest starred in two episodes of ''[[Monk (TV series)|Monk]]'' ("Mr. Monk Joins a Cult" and "[[Mr. Monk's 100th Case]]").

==Later work==
[[File:Howie Mandell performing in Monroe, Washington.JPG|thumb|left|200px|Mandel in Monroe, Washington, 2010]]
Mandel is known for his frequent appearances as a comedian and for his [[hidden camera]] segments on ''[[The Tonight Show with Jay Leno]]''. He has appeared in many television commercials for [[Boston Pizza]] as their hired spokesperson. In April 2004, he was selected as number 82 on [[Comedy Central]]'s list of the 100 greatest stand up comedians of all time. In October 2005, he was named to be the host of the US version of ''[[Deal or No Deal (U.S. game show)|Deal or No Deal]]'', which debuted on December 19, 2005, on [[NBC]] and became a popular program in early 2006. Mandel also hosts ''[[Deal or No Deal Canada]]''; originating from Toronto, ''Deal or No Deal Canada'' debuted in January 2007 on [[Global Television Network|Global]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canada.com/globaltv/globalshows/et_story.html?id=fe168ca7-8b94-45ea-a76a-9b487f1690ef&amp;k=78245 |title=Deal or No Deal, eh? |work=Canada.com |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20071015120401/http://canada.com/globaltv/globalshows/et_story.html?id=fe168ca7-8b94-45ea-a76a-9b487f1690ef&amp;k=78245 |archivedate=October 15, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which made him one of the few game show hosts (''[[Weakest Link (U.S. game show)|Weakest Link']]''s [[Anne Robinson]], [[The Chair (game show)|The Chair]]{{'}}s [[John McEnroe]], [[Pyramid (game show)|Pyramid]]{{'}}s [[Donny Osmond]], [[The Singing Bee (U.S. game show)|The Singing Bee]]{{'}}s [[Joey Fatone]], and [[Minute to Win It]]{{'}}s [[Darren McMullen]] being others) to host both a domestic and an international version of the same game show. Mandel joins [[Alex Trebek]], [[Jim Perry (television)|Jim Perry]], and [[Geoff Edwards]] on the list of game show hosts who emceed one game show simultaneously in Canada and the United States.

In 2007, Mandel made an appearance in an episode of ''[[Sesame Street]]''’s 38th season. That same year, he was parodied on the show as Howie Eatswell, the [[Muppet]] host of ''Sesame''{{'}}s game show segment "Meal or No Meal". Mandel has hosted the DVD game version of ''Deal or No Deal'', "Fact or Crap Beat Da Bomb" and "Would You Rather" for [[Imagination Games]].

Mandel had a cameo appearance as himself on the NBC show ''[[My Name is Earl]]'', in the episode Earl's roommates robbed an Indian casino at which Mandel was performing. While stealing money, they also kidnapped Mandel. In the episode, Mandel performed his old routine of inflating a rubber glove over his head with his nostrils.

Mandel is a notable alumnus of Beth David B'nai Israel Beth Am's Hebrew School located in Toronto, as well as three other Toronto high schools.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cjnews.com/pastissues/00/apr6-00/tab/tab1.htm |title=Howie Mandel to headline ICRF gala |work=Canadian Jewish News |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20050426161719/http://www.cjnews.com/pastIssues/00/apr6-00/tab/tab1.htm |archivedate=April 26, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandel is currently performing a variety/comedy act at the [[MGM Grand Las Vegas|MGM Grand Hotel-Casino]] in [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]].

Starting in 2007, Mandel became a spokesperson for Internet retailer buy.com. He is sometimes featured in a section called "What's Shakin'?" with Mandel. On September 8, 2008, Mandel began hosting a five-day-a-week [[Television syndication|syndicated]] daytime version of ''[[Deal or No Deal (U.S. syndicated game show)|Deal or No Deal]]'', with a top prize of $500,000. On January 9, 2009, Mandel's reality show ''[[Howie Do It]]'' premiered on NBC.

On March 31, 2011, Mandel premiered a [[Flash mob|flash-mob]] show on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] called ''[[Mobbed]]''. Originally a presentation pilot, the ratings after ''[[American Idol]]'' prompted Fox to pick up the show for eight to ten episodes.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/04/01/us-mobbed-idUSTRE73073120110401 "Network orders Howie Mandel's "Mobbed".' to series"] Reuters, April 1, 2011&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 30, 2012, he hosted the NASCAR [[Sprint Cup Series|Sprint Cup]] Awards Ceremony. On December 10, 2012, his six-night special game show, ''[[Take It All (game show)|Take It All]]'', premiered.

He appeared in one episode of the animated series ''Fugget About It'' as the voice of FBI Agent Rick Chickmagnet in 2013.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title=Fugget About It (TV Series 2012–2016)|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt1799834/fullcredits|language=en|accessdate=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 2013, Mandel has executive-produced the TBS hidden-camera show ''[[Deal with It (TV series)|Deal with It]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.entlawdigest.com/2014/02/03/2934.htm |accessdate=2014-03-17 |date=2014-02-03 |title=Prank TV show sued for $100,000 |author=Matt Reynolds |work=Entertainment Law Digest}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.deadline.com/2013/01/tbs-orders-howie-mandel-hidden-camera-series-mark-burnett-game-show/ |title=TBS Orders Howie Mandel Hidden Camera Series, Mark Burnett Game Show |accessdate=2014-03-17 |date=2013-01-11 |work=Deadline |author=Nellie Andreeva}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also regularly makes appearances and co-hosts the show along with main host [[Theo Von]].

===''Deal or No Deal''===
In 2003, while Mandel was deciding whether or not to quit show business, the executive producers at NBC asked him to host the show, but he declined many times. They then mailed him a tape of the overseas version and he finally accepted.{{Citation needed|date=May 2011}} In 2007, he hosted a five-episode run of the Canadian-English version. The show then went to daytime with Mandel remaining as host, although [[Arsenio Hall]] was originally intended to host the show. In a January 2009 interview on ''[[Anytime with Bob Kushell]]'', Mandel expressed mild, jovial frustration over how some of his contestants hold out during the game show, despite the fact that the grand prize is many times what they would make in a year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite episode | title = Anytime with Bob Kushell feat. Howie Mandel | series = Anytime with Bob Kushell | airdate = January 15, 2009 | season = 1 | number = 5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On March 12, 2018, it was announced that Mandel will host the 2018 [[CNBC]] revival of the game show, and also become an executive producer. &lt;ref&gt;http://deadline.com/2018/03/cnbc-greenlights-deal-or-no-deal-reboot-howie-mandel-1202336799/&lt;/ref&gt; The show will premiere on December 5, 2018.

===''America's Got Talent''===
In January 2010, it was announced that Mandel would replace [[David Hasselhoff]] as one of the judges on NBC's ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' after Hasselhoff announced that he was leaving to work on a new television series.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Howie-Mandel-Joins-1013555.aspx|title=Howie Mandel Joins America's Got Talent|date=2010-01-10|website=TVGuide.com|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt; Out of all judges on the show, Mandel currently has the longest tenure than any other judge or host, nine consecutive seasons.

On September 4, 2008, Mandel received a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]], and Comedy Central list him as #82 on their list of the 100 greatest stand-up comedians of all time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.hollywood.com/photo/Hollywood_Walk_of_Fame_Ceremony_Honoring_Howie_Mandel_Howie_Mandel/5304977/5305029|title=General Archives {{!}} Hollywood.com|website=Hollywood.com|language=en-US|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mandel received a star on [[Canada's Walk of Fame]] in Toronto. The induction ceremony was held on September 12, 2009.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/news/the-stars-align-12th-annual-canadas-walk-fame |title=The Stars Align at the 12th Annual Canada's Walk of Fame |date=June 16, 2009 |publisher=Canada's Walk of Fame |accessdate=June 16, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090620081814/http://www.canadaswalkoffame.com/news/the-stars-align-12th-annual-canadas-walk-fame |archivedate=June 20, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; He is the third game show host to be inducted (the first being [[Monty Hall]] in 2002 and the second being [[Alex Trebek]] in 2006).

In October 2008, Mandel revealed that he has [[attention deficit hyperactivity disorder]] (ADHD) on the morning talk show ''[[Live with Regis and Kelly]]'', adding that he is currently working to raise adult ADHD awareness among the general public. On January 12, 2009, Mandel was reportedly sent to [[St. Michael's Hospital, Toronto|St. Michael's Hospital]] in [[Toronto]] suffering from chest pains and what was reported as a minor heart attack. According to various news reports, he was experiencing an irregular heartbeat, but the reports were later revealed as inaccurate. He was later discharged.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.cnn.com/2009/SHOWBIZ/TV/01/13/howie.mandel.hospitalized/index.html |publisher=CNN | title=Game show host Howie Mandel out of hospital| date=January 13, 2009 | accessdate=May 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mandel has written and published an in-depth autobiography which details his life with [[OCD]], [[ADHD]], and comedy called ''[[Here's the Deal: Don't Touch Me]]''.

Mandel is a fan of the [[Toronto Maple Leafs]] hockey team.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://metronews.ca/features/toronto-maple-leafs-the-playoffs/644148/famous-fans-of-the-toronto-maple-leafs/|title=Famous fans of the Toronto Maple Leafs {{!}} Metro News|website=metronews.ca|access-date=2016-06-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Obsessive compulsive disorder===
[[File:Howie Mandel SAMHSA.jpg|left|thumb|Mandel on Children's Mental Health Awareness Day, 2007]]
Mandel has spoken publicly about having [[obsessive compulsive disorder]], which can take many forms, including [[mysophobia]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abcnews.go.com/2020/howie-mandel-public-obsessive-compulisve-disorder-fear-germs/story?id=9153966|title=Howie Mandel 'Deals' Publicly With OCD|first=A.

Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders. 5th edition.&lt;/ref&gt; Mandel's anxiety affects him to the point that he does not shake hands with anyone, including enthusiastic contestants on ''Deal or No Deal'', unless he is wearing latex gloves. Instead of shaking contestants' hands when they offer them, Mandel often opts to exchange [[fist bump]]s, put his hands on contestants' shoulders, or give an occasional hug. He once kissed a female contestant on the show for good luck despite his disorder. He now takes medicine to control his condition and even pokes fun at himself for it. He revealed on ''[[The Howard Stern Show]]'' on March 24, 2006, that his shaved head is not related to natural hair loss, but to OCD. He stated that the lack of hair makes him feel cleaner.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.howardstern.com/rundown.hs?d=1143176400 HALLE THE HUMORLESS] Howard Stern official site, March 24, 2006&lt;/ref&gt; In the back yard of Mandel's house is a second, smaller house which he had built especially to live in solitude when a family member is sick.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=dSZNnz9SM4g|title=Howie Mandel Talks About Living With OCD|author=ABC News|date=2009-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; During his appearance on ''[[Mad TV]]'', Mandel and cast member [[Bobby Lee]] made fun of the former's condition. Mandel also confronted his germophobia in Season 4, Episode 1 of the Comedy Central series ''This Is Not Happening''. The show aired on February 3, 2018. &lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.cc.com/episodes/9fbjfz/this-is-not-happening-filth-season-4-ep-401|title=This Is Not Happening - Filth {{!}} Comedy Central|website=Comedy Central|access-date=2018-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While guest-hosting on ''[[Live with Kelly and Ryan|Live with Regis and Kelly]]'' in 2005, Mandel had an altercation in which his hand was seized by guest [[Rob Schneider]]; who condescendingly teased Mandel, stating he needed to 'get over' his phobia. Host [[Kelly Ripa]] admonished Schneider on-air, while also obtaining hand sanitizer for Mandel from an audience member. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ROB SCHNEIDER SHAKES HOWIE MANDEL'S HAND

In September 2007, Mandel interviewed former [[National Football League|NFL]] running back [[Marshall Faulk]] on [[NFL Network]]. Faulk asked him to shake hands, but Mandel refused, noting he would rather have the fist tap, as he does with ''Deal or No Deal'' contestants. Seconds later, Faulk subjected him to a "sneak attack", and shook his right hand. Mandel screamed and walked away from Faulk. He then washed his hands several times.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Marshall Faulk attacks Howie Mandel|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nUT2G4Rb92o|accessdate=December 5, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; On a guest appearance on ''[[Free Radio (TV series)|Free Radio]]'', Mandel explained that not only is he afraid of public bathrooms, but is unable to use any bathroom other than his own.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;VideoID=28247050 |title=Video – MySpace Video |publisher=MySpace |accessdate=August 4, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=http://arquivo.pt/wayback/20090630043049/http://vids.myspace.com/index.cfm?fuseaction=vids.individual&amp;VideoID=28247050 |archivedate=June 30, 2009 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the season 5 episode of ''[[America's Got Talent]]'' in Chicago, Zach Carty attempted an act involving sneezing. Mandel pressed his X button at the beginning of the act, and ran into an aisle until the act was over. (Carty was unable to perform the act.) Mandel kept yelling at the other judges, [[Piers Morgan]] and [[Sharon Osbourne]], to press their X buttons and for the audience to turn in his direction. Morgan eventually pressed the X button, but Osbourne refused, so Mandel promptly ran over and pressed her button, ending the act. In a backstage interview, he expressed to the television audience that he receives therapy to help him cope. In another ''America's Got Talent'' season 5 incident, Dan Sperry, a contestant on the YouTube quarterfinal episode, dropped some dental floss that he had run through his neck as part of a magic act. He dropped the floss in Mandel's vicinity, prompting him to get up and run to the other side of the judges' table.{{episode needed|date=July 2017}}&lt;!-- video has disappeared &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1n7Y9EA17yQ&lt;/ref&gt; ---&gt; Just before Sperry's next performance in the semifinals, Mandel admitted that it was "the most horrified" he'd been on the show and that his therapist "loves [Dan Sperry]", because there had been two extra sessions that week.&lt;!-- video has disappeared &lt;ref&gt;https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ZjueImBkTDw&lt;/ref&gt; --&gt;{{episode needed|date=July 2017}} During the premiere of season 6, juggler Frank Oliver grabbed Mandel's head to balance himself during a unicycle act. Despite receiving a buzzer from Mandel, Oliver moved on to the next round. Mandel refused to give Oliver any feedback during the judge's voting process.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://youtube.com/watch?v=meXexacT3hI|title=Frank Olivier, 50 ~ America's Got Talent 2011, LA Auditions|first=|last=AmericanIdolReviews|date=August 2, 2011|publisher=|accessdate=July 27, 2017|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During [[America's Got Talent (season 10)|''AGT'''s 10th season]], a contestant named Chris Jones directly utilized Mandel's mysophobia (fear of germs) as the subject of his [[hypnotism]] act. Under the [[post-hypnotic suggestion]] that Jones and the other judges were wearing latex gloves, Mandel shook the bare hands of all involved, which elicited shouts of amazement and drew much attention on the [[Internet]]. After viewing the video of the act, Mandel said that he was "upset about it" and "somewhat betrayed" by the act but that his therapist subsequently said it was a good thing.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.today.com/popculture/howie-mandel-says-agt-hypnotism-act-didnt-cure-him-t23106|title=Howie Mandel says 'AGT' hypnotism didn't cure him, it sent him to therapy|last=Hines|first=Ree|work=[[Today (U.S. TV program)|Today]]|date=May 27, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chris Jones progressed to the Judge's Cuts where he was eliminated from the competition.

Mandel commented in 2011 that he has struggled with the condition since childhood, but did not seek help until he was an adult:
{{quote|"I don’t remember a time when I didn’t feel there was an issue. But I wasn’t diagnosed until adulthood. I’ve always felt a little bit different, and I always knew I wasn’t as comfortable with life as everybody else seemed to be. But I didn’t know what I could do about it. When I was a kid, I didn’t know anybody who went to a psychiatrist. There was always a stigma attached to mental health issues. I think there still is. But now I’m taking care of myself."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://abilitymagazine.com/Howie-Mandel.html|title=''Ability Magazine: Howie Mandel Interview with Chet Cooper"'' (2011)|accessdate=2012-04-04}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Early life and education==
Hansen was born in [[Denison, Iowa|Denison]], [[Iowa]], to James Ivan Hansen and Gladys Ray Hansen.&lt;ref&gt;Charles Sherwin Shene and Donna Hansen Stene, ''The Hansen Family,'' Decorah, IA, 2009, 56-57.&lt;/ref&gt; He was trained in physics and astronomy in the [[space science]] program of [[James Van Allen]] at the [[University of Iowa]]. He obtained a [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] in Physics and Mathematics with highest distinction in 1963, an [[Master of Science|M.S.]] in Astronomy in 1965 and a [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in Physics in 1967, all three degrees from the University of Iowa. He participated in the NASA graduate traineeship from 1962 to 1966 and, at the same time, between 1965 and 1966, he was a visiting student at the Institute of Astrophysics at the [[University of Kyoto]] and in the Department of Astronomy at the [[University of Tokyo]]. He then began work at the [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]] in 1967.&lt;ref name="Tracker"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://earthobservatory.nasa.gov/Features/GISSTemperature/ |title=Earth's Temperature Tracker
| author=David Herring
| date=November 5, 2007
| publisher=NASA
| work=Earth Observatory
| accessdate=March 19, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career==
After [[graduate school]], Hansen continued his work with [[Atmospheric radiative transfer codes|radiative transfer models]], attempting to understand the [[Atmosphere of Venus|Venusian atmosphere]]. He later applied and refined these models to understand the [[Earth's atmosphere]], and in particular, the effects that [[aerosols]] and [[trace gases]] have on Earth's climate. His development and use of [[global climate model]]s has contributed to the further understanding of the [[Earth's climate]]. In 2009 his first book, ''[[Storms of My Grandchildren]]'', was published.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | last = Kloor | first = Keith | title = The eye of the storm | journal = Nature Reports Climate Change | issue = 912 | pages = 139–140 | date = November 26, 2009 | url = http://www.nature.com/climate/2009/0912/full/climate.2009.124.html | doi = 10.1038/climate.2009.124 | accessdate = December 19, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2012 he presented the [[TED Talk]] "Why I must speak out about climate change".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ted.com/talks/james_hansen_why_i_must_speak_out_about_climate_change|title=Why I must speak out about climate change|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

From 1981 to 2013, he was the director of the [[NASA]] [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]] in [[New York City]], a part of the [[Goddard Space Flight Center]].

{{As of|2014}}, Hansen directs the Program on Climate Science, Awareness and Solutions at Columbia University's Earth Institute.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.sciencemag.org/climate/2014/02/hansens-climate-science-and-advocacy-project-under-way|title=Hansen's Climate Science and Advocacy Project Under Way|date=26 February 2014|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The program is working to continue to "connect the dots" from advancing basic climate science to promoting public awareness to advocating policy actions.

Hansen is representing his granddaughter as well as "future generations" as plaintiffs in the ''[[Juliana v. United States]]'' lawsuit, which is suing the United States government and some of its executive branch's positions for not protecting a stable climate system.

==Research and publications==
As a college student at the [[University of Iowa]], Hansen was attracted to science and the research done by James Van Allen's [[space science]] program in the physics and astronomy department. A decade later, his focus shifted to planetary research that involved trying to understand the climate change on earth that will result from [[Human impact on the environment|anthropogenic]] changes of the atmospheric composition.

Hansen has stated that one of his research interests is radiative transfer in planetary atmospheres, especially the interpretation of [[remote sensing]] of the Earth's atmosphere and surface from satellites. Because of the ability of satellites to monitor the entire globe, they may be one of the most effective ways to monitor and study global change. His other interests include the development of [[global circulation model]]s to help understand the observed climate trends, and diagnosing human impacts on climate.&lt;ref name="hansenbio"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.giss.nasa.gov/staff/jhansen.html |title=Dr. James E. Hansen |publisher=NASA |work=Personnel Directory |accessdate=February 2, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20041015153937/http://www.giss.nasa.gov/staff/jhansen.html |archivedate=October 15, 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Studies of Venus===
[[File:Venus-real color.jpg|right|thumb|Venus is surrounded by a [[Atmosphere of Venus|thick atmosphere]] composed mainly of carbon dioxide and nitrogen, and its clouds are sulfuric acid. The thickness of the atmosphere initially made it difficult to determine why the surface was so hot.]]

In the late 1960s and early 1970s, following his Ph.D. dissertation, Hansen published several papers on the planet [[Venus]]. Venus has a high [[brightness temperature]] in the radio frequencies compared to the infrared. He proposed that the hot surface was the result of aerosols trapping the internal energy of the planet.&lt;ref name="dustmodel1967"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1086/149410 |author1=Hansen, J.E. |author2=S. Matsushima |date=1967 |title=The atmosphere and surface temperature of Venus: A dust insulation model |journal=[[Astrophys. J.]] |volume=150 |pages=1139–1157 |url=http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1967/1967_Hansen_Matsushima.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111020165110/http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/1967/1967_Hansen_Matsushima.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-10-20 |bibcode=1967ApJ...150.1139H }}&lt;/ref&gt; More recent studies have suggested that several billion years ago, [[Atmosphere of Venus|Venus's atmosphere]] was much more like Earth's than it is now and that there were probably substantial quantities of liquid water on the surface, but a [[runaway greenhouse effect]] was caused by the evaporation of that original water, which generated a critical level of [[greenhouse gas]]es in its atmosphere.&lt;ref name="kasting-greenhouse"&gt;{{cite journal | title = Runaway and moist greenhouse atmospheres and the evolution of earth and Venus | author = Kasting J.F. | journal = [[Icarus (journal)|Icarus]] | volume = 74 | issue = 3 | pages = 472–494 | date = 1988 | doi = 10.1016/0019-1035(88)90116-9 | pmid=11538226 | bibcode=1988Icar...74..472K| url = https://zenodo.org/record/1253896 | type = Submitted manuscript }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hansen continued his study of Venus by looking at the composition of its [[clouds]].

By 1974, the composition of Venus' clouds had not yet been determined, with many scientists proposing a wide variety of compounds, including liquid water and aqueous solutions of ferrous chloride. Hansen and Hovenier used the polarization of sunlight reflected from the planet to establish that the clouds were spherical and had a [[refractive index]] and [[cloud drop effective radius]] which eliminated all of the proposed cloud types except sulfuric acid.&lt;ref name="polarization1974"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Hansen, J.E. |author2=J.W.

They found that the visible clouds are a diffuse haze rather than a thick cloud, confirming the same results obtained from transits across the sun.&lt;ref name="polarization1975"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Kawabata, K. |author2=J.E.

The [[Pioneer Venus project]] was launched in May 1978 and reached Venus late that same year. Hansen collaborated with [[Larry Travis]] and other colleagues in a 1979 ''[[Science (journal)|Science]]'' article that reported on the development and variability of clouds in the ultraviolet spectrum. They conclude that there are at least three different cloud materials that contribute to the images: a thin haze layer, sulfuric acid clouds and an unknown ultraviolet absorber below the sulfuric acid cloud layer.&lt;ref name="travis-venus-1979"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Travis, L.D., D.L.

===Global temperature analysis===
[[File:Peoria ASOS.jpg|left|thumb|A typical [[automated airport weather station]] which records the routine hourly weather observations of temperature, weather type, wind, sky condition, and visibility. These surface stations are located around the world, and are used to derive a [[global temperature]].]]

The first [[GISS]] ([[NASA]] [[Goddard Institute for Space Studies]]) global temperature analysis was published in 1981. Hansen and his co-author analyzed the surface air temperature at meteorological stations focusing on the years from 1880 to 1985. Temperatures for stations closer together than 1000 kilometers were shown to be highly correlated, especially in the mid-latitudes, providing a way to combine the station data to provide accurate long-term variations. They conclude that global mean temperatures can be determined even though meteorological stations are typically in the Northern hemisphere and confined to continental regions. Warming in the past century was found to be {{nowrap |0.5-0.7 °C}}, with warming similar in both hemispheres.&lt;ref name="temptrends-1987"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.1029/JD092iD11p13345 |author1=Hansen, J.E. |author2=S.

With the 1991 eruption of Mount Pinatubo, 1992 saw a cooling in the global temperatures. There was speculation that this would cause the next couple years to be cooler because of the large [[serial correlation]] in the global temperatures. Bassett and Lin found the statistical odds of a new temperature record to be small.&lt;ref name="bassettandlin"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Bassett, G.W. Jr.  |author2=Z.

The temperature data was updated in 1999 to report that 1998 was the warmest year since the instrumental data began in 1880. They also found that the rate of temperature change was larger than at any time in instrument history, and conclude that the recent [[El Niño]] was not totally responsible for the large temperature anomaly in 1998. In spite of this, the United States had seen a smaller degree of warming, and a region in the eastern U.S. and the western Atlantic Ocean had actually cooled slightly.&lt;ref name="temptrends-1999"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hansen, J., R.

2001 saw a major update to how the temperature was calculated. It incorporated corrections due to the following reasons: time-of-observation bias; station history changes; classification of rural/urban station; the urban adjustment based on satellite measurements of night light intensity, and relying more on rural station than urban. Evidence was found of local urban warming in urban, suburban and small-town records.&lt;ref name="ustemptrends-2001"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hansen, J.E., R. Ruedy, Mki. Sato, M. Imhoff, W.

The anomalously high global temperature in 1998 due to [[El Niño-Southern Oscillation|El Niño]] resulted in a brief drop in subsequent years. However, a 2001 Hansen report in the journal ''Science'' states that global warming continues, and that the increasing temperatures should stimulate discussions on how to slow global warming.&lt;ref name="hansen2002science"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hansen, J., R.

In 2007, [[Stephen McIntyre]] notified [[GISS]] that many of the U.S. temperature records from the [[Global Historical Climatology Network|Historical Climatology Network]] (USHCN) displayed a discontinuity around the year 2000. NASA corrected the computer code used to process the data and credited McIntyre with pointing out the flaw.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://data.giss.nasa.gov/gistemp/updates/200708.html |work=GISS Surface Temperature Analysis |title=August 2007 update |accessdate=6 February 2009 |date=August 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen indicated that he felt that several news organizations had overreacted to this mistake.&lt;ref name="usufruct"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/20070816_realdeal.pdf |title=The Real Deal: Usufruct &amp; the Gorilla |author=James Hansen |date=August 2007 |accessdate=6 February 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218204605/http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/20070816_realdeal.pdf |archivedate=18 December 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Marc Kaufman|title=NASA Revisions Create a Stir in The Blogosphere|publisher=The Washington Post|date=August 15, 2007|page=A6|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2007/08/14/AR2007081401677.html |accessdate=2007-09-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2010, Hansen published a paper entitled "Global Surface Temperature Change" describing current global temperature analysis.&lt;ref name="Globalsurfacetemperaturechange-2010"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=J.

===Black carbon studies===
[[File:Fire above Snake River.jpg|right|thumb|The incomplete combustion of biomass during the [[Yellowstone fires of 1988]] near the Snake River introduced a large quantity of black carbon particles into the atmosphere.]]

Hansen has also contributed toward the understanding of [[black carbon]] on regional climate. In recent decades, northern China has experienced increased drought, and southern China has received increased summer rain resulting in a larger number of floods. Southern China has had a decrease in temperatures while most of the world has warmed. In a paper with Menon and colleagues, through the use of observations and climate models results, they conclude that the black carbon heats the air, increases convection and precipitation, and leads to larger surface cooling than if the aerosols were sulfates.&lt;ref name="menon2002"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Menon, S., J.E. Hansen, L. Nazarenko, and Y.

A year later, Hansen teamed with [[Makiko Sato]] to publish a study on black carbon using the global network of [[AERONET]] sun photometers. While the location of the AERONET instruments did not represent a global sample, they could still be used to validate global aerosol climatologies. They found that most aerosol climatologies underestimated the amount of black carbon by a factor of at least 2.&lt;ref name="novakov2004"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Novakov, T. |author2=J.E.

Estimations of trends in black carbon emissions show that there was a rapid increase in the 1880s after the start of the [[Industrial Revolution]], and a leveling off from 1900–1950 as environmental laws were enacted. China and India have recently increased their emissions of black carbon corresponding to their rapid development.&lt;ref name="novakov2003"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Novakov, T., V. Ramanathan, J.E.

They report that atmospheric black carbon concentrations have been decreasing since the beginning of the record in the 1960s, and that the decline was faster than the decline in black-carbon-producing fuel use.

A 2007 paper used the GISS climate model in an attempt to determine the origin of black carbon in the arctic. Much of the arctic aerosol comes from south Asia. Countries such as the United States and Russia have a lower contribution than previously assumed.&lt;ref name="koch-2005"&gt;{{cite journal |author1=Koch, D. |author2=J.

===Anthropogenic impact on climate===
[[File:Miamibeachnorth.jpg|left|thumb|Hansen has warned that low-lying coastal areas such as Florida (seen here), East Anglia, the Netherlands, oceanic islands and Bangladesh are vulnerable to sea levels rising.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal| url=http://www.nybooks.com/articles/19131 |volume=53 |date=13 July 2006 |title=The Threat to the Planet |author=Jim Hansen |journal=The New York Review of Books |issue=12 }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]

The [[United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change]] is an international environmental treaty that has the objective of stabilizing greenhouse gas concentrations in the atmosphere at a level that would [[Avoiding dangerous climate change|prevent dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system]].

In 2000, Hansen advanced an alternative view of global warming over the last 100 years, arguing that during that time frame the negative forcing via aerosols and the positive forcing via carbon dioxide ({{CO2|link=yes}}) largely balanced each other out, and that the 0.74±0.18&amp;nbsp;°C net rise in average global temperatures could mostly be explained by [[greenhouse gases]] other than carbon dioxide, such as [[methane]] and [[chlorofluorocarbons]]. However, even then he wrote "the future balance of forcings is likely to shift toward dominance of CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; over aerosols".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://www.pnas.org/content/97/18/9875|title=Global warming in the twenty-first century: An alternative scenario|first1=James|last1=Hansen|first2=Makiko|last2=Sato|first3=Reto|last3=Ruedy|first4=Andrew|last4=Lacis|first5=Valdar|last5=Oinas|date=29 August 2000|journal=PNAS|volume=97|issue=18|pages=9875–9880|via=www.pnas.org|doi=10.1073/pnas.170278997|pmid=10944197|pmc=27611|bibcode=2000PNAS...97.9875H}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2003, Hansen wrote a paper called "Can We Defuse the Global Warming Time Bomb?" in which he argued that human-caused forces on the climate are now greater than natural ones, and that this, over a long time period, can cause large climate changes.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite document | volume = 1| pages = 01–16| last = Hansen| first = James| title = Can we defuse the global warming time bomb| work = naturalScience| date = 2003|  url = http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2003/2003_Hansen_ha07900q.pdf|format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt; He further states that a lower limit on "dangerous anthropogenic interference" is set by the stability of the Greenland and Antarctic [[ice sheet]]s. His view on actions to mitigate climate change is that "halting global warming requires urgent, unprecedented international cooperation, but the needed actions are feasible and have additional benefits for human health, agriculture and the environment."

In a 2004 presentation at the University of Iowa, Hansen announced that he was told by high-ranking government officials not to talk about how anthropogenic influence could have a dangerous effect on climate because it's not understood what 'dangerous' means, or how humans are actually affecting climate. He describes this as a [[deal with the Devil|Faustian bargain]] because atmospheric aerosols have health risks, and should be reduced, but doing so will effectively increase the warming effects from {{CO2}}.&lt;ref name="Faustianbargain2004"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/2004/dai_complete_20041026.pdf |title=Dangerous Anthropogenic Interference |author=James Hansen |date=26 October 2004 |accessdate=7 February 2009 |quote=Natural regional climate fluctuations remain larger today than human-made effects such as global warming. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hansen and coauthors propose that the global mean temperature is a good tool to diagnose dangerous anthropogenic interference with the climate system. Two elements are particularly important when discussing dangerous anthropogenic interference: sea level rise and the extinction of species. They describe a business-as-usual scenario, which has greenhouse gases growing at approximately 2% per year; and an alternate scenario, in which greenhouse gases concentrations decline. Under the alternate scenario, sea levels could rise by 1 meter per century, causing problems due to the dense population in coastal areas. But this would be minor compared to the 10-meter increase in sea level under the business-as-usual scenario. Hansen describes the situation with species extinction similarly to that of sea level rise. Assuming the alternate scenario, the situation is not good, but it is much worse for business as usual.&lt;ref name="hansenPNAS2006" /&gt;

The concept of dangerous anthropogenic interference was clarified in a 2007 paper, finding that further warming of 1&amp;nbsp;°C would be highly disruptive to humans. An alternate scenario would keep the warming to below this if climate sensitivity were below 3&amp;nbsp;°C for doubled {{CO2}}. The conclusion is that {{CO2}} levels above 450 [[Parts per million|ppm]] are considered dangerous, but that reduction in non-{{CO2}} greenhouse gases can provide temporary relief from drastic {{CO2}} cuts. Further findings are that arctic climate change has been forced by non-{{CO2}} constituents as much as by {{CO2}}. The 2007 paper cautions that prompt action is needed to slow {{CO2}} growth and to prevent a dangerous anthropogenic interference.&lt;ref name="hansen-interference-2007"&gt;{{cite journal |doi=10.5194/acp-7-2287-2007 |author=Hansen, J., Mki.

===Climate model development and projections===
[[File:Hansen 2006 temperature comparison.jpg|right|thumb|A comparison of [[global surface temperature]] computed for three scenarios and compared with two analysis of observational data.]]

[[Vilhelm Bjerknes]] began the modern development of the general circulation model in the early 20th century. The progress of numerical modeling was slow due to the slow speed of early computers and the lack of adequate observations. It wasn't until the 1950s that the numerical models were getting close to being realistic.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aip.org/history/climate/GCM.htm |title=General Circulation Models of Climate |work=The Discovery of Global Warming |author=Spencer Weart |publisher=[[American Institute of Physics]] | date=July 2008 |accessdate=11 February 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen's first contribution to numerical climate models came with the 1974 publication of the GISS model. He and his colleagues claimed that the model was successful in simulating the major features of sea-level pressure and 500mb heights in the North American region.&lt;ref name="GISS-model-1974"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Somerville, R.C.J., P.H.

A 1981 ''Science'' publication by Hansen and a team of scientists at Goddard concluded that carbon dioxide in the atmosphere would lead to warming sooner than previously predicted. They used a one-dimensional radiative-convective model that calculates temperature as a function of height. They reported that the results from the 1D model are similar to those of the more complex 3D models, and can simulate basic mechanisms and feedbacks.&lt;ref name="hansen1981"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hansen, J., D.

He also predicted that it would be difficult to convince politicians and the public to react.&lt;ref&gt;"Experts Find Possible Climatic 'Bomb'", Eleanor Randolph, Staff writer, ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'', August 9, 1981, pg B3&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1980s, the computational speed of computers, along with refinements in climate models, allowed longer experiments. The models now included physics beyond the previous equations, such as convection schemes, diurnal changes, and snow-depth calculations. The advances in computational efficiency, combined with the added physics, meant the GISS model could be run for five years. It was shown that global climate can be simulated reasonably well with a grid-point resolution as coarse as 1000 kilometers.&lt;ref name="3dmodels-1983"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hansen, J., G.

The first climate prediction computed from a general circulation model that was published by Hansen was in 1988, the same year as his well-known Senate testimony.&lt;ref name=nyt19880624&gt;{{cite news |page=1

Hansen concluded that global warming would be evident within the next few decades, and that it would result in temperatures at least as high as during the [[Eemian]]. He argued that, if the temperature rises {{nowrap | 0.4 °C}} above the 1950–1980 mean for a few years, it is the "smoking gun" pointing to human-caused global warming.&lt;ref name="3dforecast-1988"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Hansen, J., I.

[[File:James Hansen.jpg|thumb|right|Hansen giving testimony before the [[United States Congress]] in 1988.]]
In 2006, Hansen and colleagues compared the observations with the projections made by Hansen in his 1988 testimony before the [[United States Congress]]. They described the intermediate scenario as the most likely, and that real-world greenhouse gas forcing has been closest to this scenario. It contained the effects of three volcanic eruptions in the fifty-year projections, with one in the 1995, whereas the recent [[Mount Pinatubo]] eruption was in 1991. They found that the observed warming was similar to two of the three scenarios. The warming rates of the two most modest warming scenarios are nearly the same through the year 2000, and they were unable to provide a precise model assessment. They did note that the agreement between the observations and the intermediate scenario was accidental because the [[climate sensitivity]] used was higher than current estimates.&lt;ref name="hansenPNAS2006" /&gt;

A year later, Hansen joined with [[Stefan Rahmstorf|Rahmstorf]] and colleagues comparing climate projections with observations. The comparison is done from 1990 through January 2007 against physics-based models that are independent from the observations after 1990. They show that the climate system may be responding faster than the models indicate. Rahmstorf and coauthors show concern that [[current sea level rise|sea levels are rising]] at the high range of the IPCC projections, and that it is due to thermal expansion and not from melting of the [[Greenland ice sheet|Greenland]] or [[Antarctic ice sheets]].&lt;ref name="rahmstorf2007"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Rahmstorf, S., A.

Following the launch of spacecraft capable of determining temperatures, [[Roy Spencer (scientist)|Roy Spencer]] and [[John Christy]] published the first version of their [[satellite temperature measurements]] in 1990. Contrary to climate models and surface measurements, their results showed a cooling in the [[troposphere]].&lt;ref name="spencer and christy"&gt;{{cite journal |author=Spencer, R.W. And J.R.

===Climate forcings, feedbacks, and sensitivity===
[[File:NasaHansenFig1.gif|thumb|right|Estimated [[climate forcings]] between 1850 and 2000]]

In 2000 Hansen authored a paper called "Global warming in the twenty-first century: an alternative scenario" in which he presented a more optimistic way of dealing with global warming, focusing on non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gases and [[black carbon]] in the short run, giving more time to make reductions in [[fossil fuel emissions]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal | last = Hansen | first = James | display-authors = etal | date = 2000 | url = http://www.giss.nasa.gov/research/features/altscenario/ | title = Global warming in the twenty-first century: An alternative scenario | journal = Proc.

This is because CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; warming is offset by climate-cooling aerosols emitted with fossil fuel burning and because at that time non-CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt; gases, taken together, were responsible for roughly 50% of the anthropogenic greenhouse gas warming.

In a 2007 paper, Hansen discussed the potential danger of "fast-feedback" effects causing [[ice sheet]] disintegration, based on [[paleoclimate]] data.&lt;ref name="trace" /&gt; [[George Monbiot]] reports "The [[IPCC]] predicts that sea levels could rise by as much as {{convert|59|cm|ft}} this century.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=[[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] |date=February 2007 |url=http://www.ipcc.ch/SPM2feb07.pdf |title=Climate Change 2007: The Physical Science Basis – Summary for Policymakers.

The geological record suggests that ice at the poles does not melt in a gradual and linear fashion, but flips suddenly from one state to another. When temperatures increased to 2–3°C (3.6–5.4°F) above today's level 3.5 million years ago, sea levels rose not by 59 centimeters but by {{convert|25|m|ft}}. The ice responded immediately to changes in temperature."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| author = George Monbiot | date = 3 July 2007 | url= http://www.monbiot.com/archives/2007/07/03/a-sudden-change-of-state/ |title = A Sudden Change of State.}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hansen stressed the uncertainties around these predictions. "It is difficult to predict time of collapse in such a nonlinear problem … An ice sheet response time of centuries seems probable, and we cannot rule out large changes on decadal time-scales once wide-scale surface melt is underway."&lt;ref name="trace" /&gt; He concludes that "present knowledge does not permit accurate specification of the dangerous level of human-made [greehouse gases]. However, it is much lower than has commonly been assumed. If we have not already passed the dangerous level, the energy infrastructure in place ensures that we will pass it within several decades."&lt;ref name="trace"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Hansen |first=James |display-authors=etal |date=2007 |url=http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2007/2007_Hansen_etal_2.pdf |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111022020035/http://pubs.giss.nasa.gov/docs/2007/2007_Hansen_etal_2.pdf |dead-url=yes |archive-date=2011-10-22 |title=Climate change and trace gases |journal=Phil.

In 2013, Hansen authored a paper called "Climate sensitivity, sea level and atmospheric carbon dioxide," in which he estimated climate sensitivity to be (3±1){{nbsp}}°C based on [[Pleistocene]] [[paleoclimate]] data. The paper also concluded that burning all fossil fuels "would make most of the planet uninhabitable by humans."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.1098/rsta.2012.0294| pmid = 24043864| pmc = 3785813| title = Climate sensitivity, sea level and atmospheric carbon dioxide| journal = Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society A: Mathematical, Physical and Engineering Sciences| volume = 371| issue = 2001| pages = 20120294| year = 2013| last1 = Hansen | first1 = J.| last2 = Sato | first2 = M.| last3 = Russell | first3 = G.| last4 = Kharecha | first4 = P.|arxiv = 1211.4846 |bibcode = 2013RSPTA.37120294H }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2016, a team of 19 researchers led by Hansen published a paper "Ice melt, sea level rise and superstorms: evidence from paleoclimate data, climate modeling, and modern observations that 2 °C global warming could be dangerous" describing the effect of meltwater from ice sheets on the [[Atlantic meridional overturning circulation]] (slowing it or even stopping) and [[Antarctic bottom water]] formation. This would speed up ice sheet melting and sea level rise by increasing the water temperature at hundreds of meters depth, thawing ice shelves from below. And the cool fresh meltwater on the ocean close to Greenland and Antarctica leads to larger temperature difference between tropics and middle latitudes, what would enable storms as strong as in the last interglacial, [[Eemian]], whose evidence are, among others, megaboulders on Bahamas.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|last=Hansen|first=J.|last2=Sato|first2=M.|last3=Hearty|first3=P.|last4=Ruedy|first4=R.|last5=Kelley|first5=M.|last6=Masson-Delmotte|first6=V.|last7=Russell|first7=G.|last8=Tselioudis|first8=G.|last9=Cao|first9=J.|date=2016-03-22|title=Ice melt, sea level rise and superstorms: evidence from paleoclimate data, climate modeling, and modern observations that 2 °C global warming could be dangerous|url=https://www.atmos-chem-phys.net/16/3761/2016/|journal=Atmos.

Hansen noted that in determining responsibility for climate change, the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on climate is determined not by current emissions, but by accumulated emissions over the lifetime of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere.

By this measure, the U.K. is still the largest single cause of climate change, followed by the U.S. and Germany, even though its current emissions are surpassed by the [[People's Republic of China]].&lt;ref name="hansen-testimony"&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/files/pdfs/climate/hansen.pdf | title=Hansen's Kingsnorth testimony | accessdate=2 February 2009 | format=PDF | deadurl=yes | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090203050846/http://www.greenpeace.org.uk/files/pdfs/climate/hansen.pdf | archivedate=3 February 2009 | df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On public policy, Hansen is critical of what he sees as efforts to mislead the public on the issue of climate change. He points specifically to the [[Competitive Enterprise Institute]]'s commercials with the tagline "carbon dioxide—they call it pollution, we call it life",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web| url=https://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=5425355 |title=They Call It Pollution.

=== US Senate committee testimony ===

Hansen was invited to testify before the [[United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources]] on June 23, 1988.&lt;ref name=besel2013&gt;{{cite journal |last=Besel |first=Richard D. |title=Accommodating climate change science: James Hansen and the rhetorical/political emergence of global warming |journal=Science in Context |volume=26 |issue=1 |year=2013 |pages=137–152 |url=http://digitalcommons.calpoly.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1014&amp;context=comm_fac |accessdate=February 20, 2016 |doi=10.1017/S0269889712000312}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen testified that "Global warming has reached a level such that we can ascribe with a high degree of confidence a cause and effect relationship between the greenhouse effect and observed warming...It is already happening now"&lt;ref name=nyt19880624/&gt; and "The greenhouse effect has been detected and it is changing our climate now...We already reached the point where the greenhouse effect is important."&lt;ref name=wp19880624&gt;{{cite news |last=Weisskopf |first=Michael |title=Scientist Says Greenhouse Effect is Setting in |newspaper=[[The Washington Post]] |date=June 24, 1988 |accessdate=February 20, 2016 |url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/archive/politics/1988/06/24/scientist-says-greenhouse-effect-is-setting-in/3844f00f-42f4-420f-8811-62de6c989d8f/}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen said that NASA was 99% confident that the warming was caused by the accumulation of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere and not a random fluctuation.&lt;ref name=nyt19880624/&gt;&lt;ref name=wp19880624/&gt;

According to science historian [[Spencer R. Weart]], Hansen's testimony increased public awareness of climate change.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Weart |first=Spencer R. |authorlink=Spencer R. Weart |title=The Discovery of Global Warming |publisher=[[Harvard University Press]] |year=2008 |isbn=9780674044975|title-link=The Discovery of Global Warming }}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Richard Besel of [[California Polytechnic State University]], Hansen's testimony "was an important turning point in the history of global climate change."&lt;ref name=besel2013/&gt; According to Timothy M. O'Donnell of the [[University of Mary Washington]], Hansen's testimony was "pivotal," "ignited public discussion of global warming and moved the controversy from a largely scientific discussion to a full blown science policy debate," and marked "the official beginning of the global warming policy debate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=O'Donnell |first=Timothy M. |title=Of loaded dice and heated arguments: Putting the Hansen-Michaels global warming debate in context |journal=[[Social Epistemology (journal)|Social Epistemology]] |volume=14 |issue=2–3 |year=2000 |pages=109–127 |url=http://www.pitt.edu/~gordonm/Pubdeb/O'Donnell.pdf |accessdate=February 20, 2016 |doi=10.1080/02691720050199199}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to [[Roger A. Pielke]] of the [[National Center for Atmospheric Research]], Hansen's "call to action" "elevated the subject of global warming and the specter of associated impacts such as more hurricanes, floods, and heat waves, to unprecedented levels of attention from the public, media, and policy makers."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Pielke |first=Roger A. |title=Policy history of the US global change research program: Part I.

===Criticism of coal industry===
Hansen has been particularly critical of the [[coal industry]], stating that coal contributes the largest percentage of anthropogenic carbon dioxide into the atmosphere.&lt;ref name="columbia.edu"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/2007/IowaCoal_20071105.pdf |work=State of Iowa: Before the Iowa Utilities Board |title=Direct Testimony of James E. Hansen |accessdate=February 2, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; He acknowledges that a molecule of carbon dioxide emitted from burning coal has the same effect as a molecule emitted from burning oil. The difference is where the fuel originally resides. He says that most oil comes from [[Russia]] and [[Saudi Arabia]], and that no matter how fuel-efficient automobiles become, the oil will eventually be burned and the {{CO2}} emitted. In a 2007 testimony before the [[Iowa Utilities Board]], he stated that the United States has a large [[Coal#World coal reserves|reservoir of coal]], which makes it a resource that can be controlled through action by U.S. politicians, unlike oil which is controlled by other countries.&lt;ref name="columbia.edu" /&gt; He has called for [[coal phase out|phasing out coal power]] completely by the year 2030.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal | doi = 10.2174/1874282300802010217| title = Target Atmospheric CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;: Where Should Humanity Aim?| journal = The Open Atmospheric Science Journal| volume = 2| issue = 1| pages = 217–231| year = 2008| last1 = Hansen | first1 = J. | authorlink1 = James Hansen| last2 = Sato | first2 = M. | last3 = Kharecha | first3 = P. | last4 = Beerling | first4 = D. | authorlink4 = David Beerling| last5 = Berner | first5 = R. | authorlink5 = Robert Berner| last6 = Masson-Delmotte | first6 = V. | last7 = Pagani | first7 = M. | last8 = Raymo | first8 = M. |authorlink8 = Maureen Raymo| last9 = Royer | first9 = D.

During his testimony before the Iowa Utilities Board in 2007, Hansen likened coal trains to "death trains" and asserted that these would be "no less gruesome than if they were boxcars headed to crematoria, loaded with uncountable irreplaceable species."&lt;ref name=NYTBlog&gt;{{cite news |url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2007/11/26/holocausts/ |title=Climate, Coal and Crematoria |first=Andrew |last=Revkin

===Retirement from NASA===
Hansen retired from NASA in April 2013 after 46 years of government service, saying he planned to take a more active role in the political and legal efforts to limit [[greenhouse gases]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Climate Maverick to Quit NASA

===Keystone Pipeline===
In a CBC interview aired in April 2013, as Canadian Natural Resources Minister [[Joe Oliver (politician)|Joe Oliver]] lobbied in Washington, DC for approval of [[Keystone Pipeline#Keystone XL|Keystone pipeline extension]] intended to carry more [[synthetic crude oil]] from Canada's [[Athabasca Oil Sands]] to the Gulf of Mexico,&lt;ref name=mongabay2011&gt;{{cite news

| title=Climate test for Obama: 1,252 people arrested over notorious oil pipeline
| publisher=Mongabay
| date=September 6, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen forcefully argued against the use of these unconventional fossil fuels. According to [[Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change]] (IPCC) and other energy organizations "there is more than twice as much carbon in the tar sands oil" than in conventional oil. Hansen argued that coal, tar sands, and tar shale should not be used as energy sources because of their carbon emissions and claimed that the completion of the Keystone pipeline would increase the extraction of oil from oil sands. He explained that the effects of climate change may not be apparent until the far future: "It's not the case where you emit something and you see the effect. We see the beginnings of the effect but the large impacts are going to be in future decades and that science is crystal clear … Effects come slowly because of the inertia of the climate system. It takes decades, even centuries to get the full response. But we know the last time the world was 2 degrees warmer, sea level was 6 meters or 20 feet higher."&lt;ref name=neanderthal27april2013&gt;{{cite news

===Proposed solutions===

Recently Hansen stated his support for a revenue-neutral [[fee and dividend]] system to impose a price on carbon that returns the money collected from the fossil fuel industry equally to all legal residents of the United States. In an interview on CBC television on March 3, 2015, Dr Hansen stated "The solution [to climate change] has to be a rising price on carbon and then the really dirty fuels like tar sands would fall on the table very quickly. They make no sense at all if you look at it from an economic-wide perspective. If we would simply put a fee on carbon – you would collect from the fossil fuel companies at the source (the domestic mines or the ports of entry) and then distribute that money to the public, an equal amount to all legal residents, that would begin to make the prices honest. And that's what the economy needs in order to be most efficient. Right now the external costs of fossil fuels are borne completely by the public. If your child gets asthma, you pay the bill, the fossil fuel company doesn't. What we need is to make the system honest."&lt;ref&gt;
http://www.cbc.ca/player/News/TV+Shows/Power+%26+Politics+with+Evan+Solomon/ID/2656936485/&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of 2008, James Hansen stated five priorities that he felt then President-elect Barack Obama should adopt "for solving the climate and energy problems, while stimulating the economy": [[efficient energy use]], [[renewable energy]], a [[smart grid]], [[generation IV reactor|generation IV nuclear reactors]] and [[carbon capture and storage]]. Regarding nuclear, he expressed opposition to the [[Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository]], stating that the $25 Billion (US) surplus held in the [[Nuclear Waste Policy Act|Nuclear Waste Fund]] "should be used to develop [[Integral Fast Reactor|fast reactors]] that consume nuclear waste, and [[liquid fluoride thorium reactor|thorium reactors]] to prevent the creation of new long-lived nuclear waste."&lt;ref name="TellTruth" /&gt;

In 2009, Hansen wrote an open letter to President [[Barack Obama|Obama]] where he advocated a "Moratorium and phase-out of coal plants that do not capture and store CO&lt;sub&gt;2&lt;/sub&gt;".&lt;ref name="James Hansen 2009"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.columbia.edu/~jeh1/mailings/20081229_DearMichelleAndBarack.pdf |format=PDF |title=James Hansen.

In March 2013, Hansen co-authored a paper in ''[[Environmental Science &amp; Technology]]'', entitled "Prevented mortality and greenhouse gas emissions from historical and projected nuclear power". The paper examined mortality rates per unit of electrical power produced from [[fossil fuels]] (coal and natural gas) as well as [[nuclear power]]. It estimated that 1.8 million air pollution-caused deaths were prevented worldwide between 1971 and 2009, through the use of nuclear power instead of fossil fuels. The paper also concluded that the emission of some 64 billion tonnes of carbon dioxide equivalent were avoided by nuclear power use between 1971 and 2009. Looking to the future, between 2010 and 2050, it was estimated that nuclear could additionally avoid up to 420,000 to 7 million premature deaths and 80 to 240 billion tonnes of greenhouse gas emissions.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |title=Prevented Mortality and Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Historical and Projected Nuclear Power |author=[[Pushker A.

They asserted that nuclear power needs large subsidies to be economically viable, and typically there are substantial construction delays and cost overruns associated with nuclear plants. Sovacool et al. also claim that Kharecha and Hansen's estimates of [[Chernobyl Disaster]] mortalities is very low, which biases their conclusions. All of these factors are said to make Kharecha and Hansen's article "incomplete and misleading".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal |url=http://www.nirs.org/climate/sovacool-et-al-hansen.pdf |title=Comment on "Prevented Mortality and Greenhouse Gas Emissions from Historical and Projected Nuclear Power" |author=[[Benjamin K.

In 2013, Hansen and three other leading climate experts wrote an open letter to policy makers, saying that "continued opposition to nuclear power threatens humanity's ability to avoid dangerous climate change."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://edition.cnn.com/2013/11/03/world/nuclear-energy-climate-change-scientists-letter/index.html | work=CNN | title=Top climate change scientists issue open letter to policy influencers – CNN.com | date=November 3, 2013}} The letter was signed by Hansen, [[Ken Caldeira]], [[Kerry Emanuel]], and [[Tom Wigley]].&lt;/ref&gt; The reaction from [[anti-nuclear]] environmental groups (e.g. the [[Natural Resources Defense Council]], [[Sierra Club]], and [[Greenpeace]]) was negative, citing [[nuclear safety and security]] issues, and the [[economics of nuclear power plants]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://grist.org/news/more-nukes-are-you-kidding-enviros-push-back-against-hansens-call/ |title=More nukes?

==Honors and awards==
Hansen was elected to the [[United States National Academy of Sciences|National Academy of Sciences]] in 1996 for his "development of pioneering radiative transfer models and studies of planetary atmospheres; development of simplified and three-dimensional global climate models; explication of climate forcing mechanisms; analysis of current climate trends from observational data; and projections of anthropogenic impacts on the global climate system."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Directory of the National Academy of Sciences | url=http://www.nasonline.org/site/Dir/694414760?pg=vprof&amp;mbr=1003147&amp;returl=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nasonline.org%2Fsite%2FDir%2F694414760%3Fpg%3Dsrch%26view%3Dbasic&amp;retmk=search_again_link | accessdate=2007-06-19}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2001, he received the 7th Annual [[Heinz Award]] in the Environment (endowed with US$250,000) for his research on global warming,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=The Heinz Awards, James Hansen profile | url=http://www.heinzawards.net/recipients/james-hansen | accessdate=2008-09-27}}&lt;/ref&gt; and was listed as one of [[Time Magazine]]'s [[Time 100|100 Most Influential People]] in 2006. Also in 2006, the [[American Association for the Advancement of Science]] (AAAS) selected James Hansen to receive its [[Award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility]] "for his courageous and steadfast advocacy in support of scientists' responsibilities to communicate their scientific opinions and findings openly and honestly on matters of public importance."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.aaas.org/aboutaaas/awards/freedom/freedom2007.shtml |title=AAAS Award for Scientific Freedom and Responsibility: James Hansen |accessdate=5 February 2009 |publisher=American Association for the Advancement of Science }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2007, Hansen shared the US $1-million [[Dan David Prize]] for "achievements having an outstanding scientific, technological, cultural or social impact on our world". In 2008, he received the [[PNC Bank]] [[Common Wealth Award of Distinguished Service]] for his "outstanding achievements" in science. At the end of 2008, Hansen was named by [[EarthSky Communications]] and a panel of 600 scientist-advisors as the ''Scientist Communicator of the Year'', citing him as an "outspoken authority on climate change" who had "best communicated with the public about vital science issues or concepts during 2008."&lt;ref name="rossby"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/centers/goddard/news/topstory/2009/hansen_ams.html |title=NASA Climate Scientist Honored by American Meteorological Society |accessdate=5 February 2009 |date=14 January 2009 |publisher=NASA }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2009, Hansen was awarded the 2009 [[Carl-Gustaf Rossby Research Medal]],&lt;ref name="rossby" /&gt; the highest honor bestowed by the [[American Meteorological Society]], for his "outstanding contributions to climate modeling, understanding climate change forcings and sensitivity, and for clear communication of climate science in the public arena."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.ametsoc.org/awards/2009awardrecipients.pdf |title=AMS Awards |publisher=American Meteorological Society |accessdate=5 February 2009 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090206121400/http://ametsoc.org/awards/2009awardrecipients.pdf |archive-date=2009-02-06 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Hansen won the 2010 [[Sophie Prize]], set up in 1997 by Norwegian [[Jostein Gaarder]], the author of the 1991 best-selling novel and teenagers' guide to philosophy ''[[Sophie's World]]'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE63636N20100407 |title=Climate scientist Hansen wins $100,000 prize |publisher=Reuters |accessdate=7 April 2010 | date=7 April 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; for his " key role for the development of our understanding of human-induced climate change."

''[[Foreign Policy]]'' named Hansen one of its 2012 [[FP Top 100 Global Thinkers]] "for sounding the alarm on climate change, early and often".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/11/26/the_fp_100_global_thinkers?page=0,10#thinker11 |title=The FP Top 100 Global Thinkers |date=26 November 2012 |work=Foreign Policy |accessdate=28 November 2012 |archivedate=28 November 2012 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/6CViUyRpk?url=http://www.foreignpolicy.com/articles/2012/11/26/the_fp_100_global_thinkers?page=0,33#thinker11 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In December 2012, Hansen received the [[Commonwealth Club of California]]'s annual [[Stephen H. Schneider]] Award for Outstanding Climate Science Communications at a ceremony in San Francisco&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://blog.sfgate.com/energy/2012/12/05/climate-guru-slams-cap-and-trade/ |title=Climate guru slams cap and trade

On November 7, 2013 Hansen received the [[Joseph Priestley]] Award at [[Dickinson College]] in Carlisle, Pennsylvania "...for his work advancing our understanding of climate change, including the early application of numerical models to better understand observed climate trends and to project humans' impact on climate, and for his leadership in promoting public understanding of climate and linking the knowledge to action on climate policy." He delivered a lecture, entitled, "White House Arrest and the Climate Crisis," later that same day at Anita Tuvin Schlechter Auditorium on the college's campus.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | url=http://www.dickinson.edu/news/article/878/sounding_the_alarm | title=Sounding the Alarm | work=[[Dickinson College]] | date=7 November 2013 | accessdate=3 March 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

James Hansen was co-winner with climatologist [[Syukuro Manabe]] of the [[BBVA Foundation Frontiers of Knowledge Award]] in the Climate Change category in the ninth edition (2016) of the awards. The two laureates were separately responsible for constructing the first computational models with the power to simulate climate behavior. Decades ago, they correctly predicted how much Earth's temperature would rise due to increasing atmospheric CO2. The scores of models currently in use to chart climate evolution are heirs to those developed by Manabe and Hansen.{{citation needed|date=June 2018}}

In June 2018, Hansen was named joint winner, with [[Veerabhadran Ramanathan]], of Taiwan's [[Tang Prize]] Foundation prize.  Hansen's prize had a total value of NT$25 million.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://focustaiwan.tw/news/aedu/201806180001.aspx|newspaper=Focus Taiwan News Channel|title=Hansen, Ramanathan win Tang Prize in sustainable development|date=18 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Controversies==

===Political interference at NASA===
In 2006, Hansen alleged that [[NASA]] administrators had attempted to influence his public statements about the [[Attribution of recent climate change|causes of climate change]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | title=Climate Expert Says NASA Tried to Silence Him | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/01/29/science/earth/29climate.html | author = Andrew Revkin | publisher=The New York Times | date=January 29, 2006 | accessdate=June 20, 2007 |quote=They feel their job is to be this censor of information going out to the public. }}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen said that NASA public relations staff were ordered to review his public statements and interviews after a December 2005 lecture at the [[American Geophysical Union]] in [[San Francisco, California|San Francisco]]. NASA responded that its policies are similar to those of any other federal agency in requiring employees to coordinate all statements with the public affairs office without exception.&lt;ref name=ABC1&gt;{{cite web | title=Top NASA Scientist Says He's Being Silenced on Global Warming

| publisher=ABC News
| date=January 29, 2006
| accessdate=June 20, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Two years after Hansen and other agency employees described a pattern of distortion and suppression of climate science by political [[wikt:appointee|appointees]], the agency's inspector general confirmed that such activities had taken place, with the NASA Office of Public Affairs having "reduced, marginalized or mischaracterized climate change science made available to the general public".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url = https://www.nytimes.com/2008/06/03/science/earth/03nasa.html|title = NASA Office Is Criticized on Climate Reports|publisher = [[The New York Times]] | author = Andrew C. Revkin|date = June 3, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2006, Hansen appeared on ''[[60 Minutes]]'' stating that the George W. Bush White House had edited climate-related press releases reported by federal agencies to make global warming seem less threatening.&lt;ref name=cbs&gt;{{cite news
| title=Rewriting the Science |author=Catherine Herrick / Bill Owens

}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also stated that he was unable to speak freely without the backlash of other government officials, and that he had not experienced that level of restrictions on communicating with the public during his career.&lt;ref name=cbs /&gt;

===Trials for energy company executives===
In 2008 interviews with ''[[ABC News]]'', ''[[The Guardian]]'', and in a separate op-ed, Hansen has called for putting [[fossil fuel]] company executives, including the CEOs of [[ExxonMobil]] and [[Peabody Coal]], on trial for "[[high crimes]] against humanity and nature", on the grounds that these and other fossil-fuel companies had actively spread doubt and misinformation about [[global warming]], in the same way that [[tobacco]] companies tried to hide the link between smoking and cancer.&lt;ref name=abc20ylater&gt;{{cite web | title=Global Warming 20 Years Later| url=http://abcnews.go.com/Video/playerIndex?id=5228739&amp;affil=wjla | author = Clayton Sandell | publisher=[[ABC News]] | date=June 23, 2008 | accessdate=2008-06-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=guardtrial&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.theguardian.com/environment/2008/jun/23/fossilfuels.climatechange?feed=science&amp;gusrc=rss |title=Put oil firm chiefs on trial, says leading climate change scientist |author=Ed Pilkington |publisher=The Guardian |date= 23 June 2008 |accessdate=6 February 2009 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ww20ylater&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.worldwatch.org/node/5798 |title= Guest Opinion: Global Warming Twenty Years Later |accessdate= 2008-06-23 |author= James Hansen |date= 2008-06-23 |publisher= [[Worldwatch Institute]] | quote= In my opinion, these CEOs should be tried for high crimes against humanity and nature. }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Arrest for protest demonstration===
[[File:NASA Scientist James Hansen Arrested.jpg|thumb|upright|James Hansen arrested at a demonstration outside the [[White House]], August 29, 2011]]Hansen and 1251 other activists were arrested in August and September 2011, at another demonstration in front of the White House. Hansen urged President Obama to reject the [[Keystone Pipeline#Keystone XL|Keystone pipeline extension]] intended to carry more [[synthetic crude oil]] from Canada's [[Athabasca Tar Sands]] to the Gulf of Mexico.&lt;ref name="mongabay2011" /&gt; On February 13, 2013, Hansen was again arrested at the White House, along with Daryl Hannah and [[Robert F. Kennedy, Jr.]], during a further protest against the proposed Keystone pipeline extension.&lt;ref name="dhxl" /&gt;

===Criticism===
In January 2009, Andrew Freedman wrote in ''[[The Washington Post]]'', that the [[American Meteorological Society]] had erred in giving Hansen its [[Carl-Gustaf Rossby Research Medal]]: "His body of work is not at issue... Rather, the problem arises due to the AMS' recognition of Hansen's public communication work on climate change."&lt;ref name=AMS&gt;{{cite news |url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/capitalweathergang/2009/01/it_normally_does_not_make.html
| title=Science Group Erred Giving Hansen Top Honor |first=Andrew |last=Freedman |work= Washington Post |date= January 29, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Former AMS member [[Joseph D'Aleo]], a skeptic of human-caused climate change, also criticized the award.&lt;ref name=AMS /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://dotearth.blogs.nytimes.com/2009/01/14/weather-mavens-honor-climate-maven/
| title=Weather Mavens Honor Climate Maven |first=Andrew |last=Revkin |work=New York Times |date= January 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also in 2009, physicist [[Freeman Dyson]] criticised Hansen's climate-change activism. "The person who is really responsible for this overestimate of global warming is Jim Hansen. He consistently exaggerates all the dangers... Hansen has turned his science into ideology."&lt;ref name=DNYT&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/29/magazine/29Dyson-t.html?sq=Freeman%20Dyson |title=The Civil Heretic
| work= New York Times
| first=Nicholas
| last=Dawidoff, |date=March 25, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hansen responded that if Dyson "is going to wander into something with major consequences for humanity and other life on the planet, then he should first do his homework".&lt;ref name=DNYT /&gt; Dyson stated in an interview that the argument with Hansen was exaggerated by ''[[The New York Times]]'', stating that he and Hansen are "friends, but we don't agree on everything."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite video

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Hansen's arrest in 2009 in West Virginia, ''New York Times'' columnist [[Andrew Revkin]] wrote: "Dr. Hansen has pushed far beyond the boundaries of the conventional role of scientists, particularly government scientists, in the environmental policy debate."&lt;ref name=NYT.E /&gt;

In June 2009, ''[[The New Yorker|New Yorker]]'' journalist [[Elizabeth Kolbert]] wrote that Hansen is "increasingly isolated among climate activists."&lt;ref name=EKNY /&gt; [[Eileen Claussen]], president of the [[Pew Center on Global Climate Change]], said that "I view Jim Hansen as heroic as a scientist.... But I wish he would stick to what he really knows. Because I don't think he has a realistic idea of what is politically possible, or what the best policies would be to deal with this problem."&lt;ref name=EKNY&gt;{{cite web| first=Elizabeth| last=Kolbert| title=The Catastrophist| work=The New Yorker| date= June 29, 2009| url=http://www.newyorker.com/reporting/2009/06/29/090629fa_fact_kolbert_Abstract}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In July 2009, ''New York Times'' climate columnist Christa Marshall asked if Hansen still matters in the ongoing climate debate, noting that he "has irked many longtime supporters with his scathing attacks against President Obama's plan for a [[cap-and-trade]] system."&lt;ref name=CMa&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.nytimes.com/cwire/2009/07/14/14climatewire-does-nasas-james-hansen-still-matter-in-clim-82897.html?pagewanted=all |title=Does NASA's James Hansen Still Matter in Climate Debate? |first= Christa |last=Marshall |work=New York Times |date= July 14, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; "The right wing loves what he's doing," said [[Joseph Romm]], a senior fellow at the [[Center for American Progress]], a [[think tank]].&lt;ref name=CMa /&gt; Hansen said that he had to speak out, since few others could explain the links between politics and the climate models. "You just have to say what you think is right," he said.&lt;ref name=CMa /&gt;

'''Joseph Wayne Miller''' (born May 10, 1967) is an [[United States|American]] attorney and politician.

Miller rose to national prominence as the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican Party]] nominee and the [[Tea Party movement|Tea Party]] favorite in the [[United States Senate election in Alaska, 2010|2010 U.S. Senate election in Alaska]]. He faced [[Democratic Party (United States)|Democrat]] [[Scott McAdams]] and incumbent Republican Senator [[Lisa Murkowski]] who, after losing the primary to Miller, mounted a large and well-funded campaign as a [[write-in]] candidate in the general election and went on to win the Senate seat.

Before running for the Senate, Miller worked as an attorney in private general practice, a local government attorney, and a [[United States magistrate judge|U.S. magistrate judge]] assisting the Alaska federal district court with its caseload. A 1995 graduate of [[Yale Law School]], he was a combat veteran of the [[1991 Gulf War]], and a graduate of the [[United States Military Academy|U.S. Military Academy]] at West Point. He is originally from [[Kansas]] and the father of eight children; he and his wife and family moved to Alaska in the mid-1990s.

Miller sought the Republican nomination to challenge incumbent Democratic Senator [[Mark Begich]] in 2014, but was defeated by [[Dan Sullivan (senator)|Dan Sullivan]] in the [[United States Senate election in Alaska, 2014#Republican primary|Republican primary]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Joe Miller Files Papers for Senate|url=http://www.politico.com/story/2013/05/joe-miller-alaska-senate-2014-91960.html?hp=r5/|work=Joe Miller Files Papers for Senate|accessdate=2013-05-31}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.elections.alaska.gov/results/14PRIM/data/results.htm|title=2014 Primary Elections August 19, 2014 Unofficial Results|publisher=State of Alaska Division of Elections|accessdate=August 20, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Cean Stevens, the Libertarian party primary winner, stepped aside to allow Miller to receive the [[Libertarian Party of Alaska|Libertarian]] nomination, so that Miller could run in the crowded [[United States Senate election in Alaska, 2016|2016 Senate election]]. He placed second in the general election, receiving just under 30% of the vote.&lt;ref name="adn.com"&gt;[http://www.adn.com/politics/2016/09/06/joe-miller-to-run-as-libertarian-in-hopes-of-unseating-us-sen-lisa-murkowski/ Joe Miller to run as Libertarian in hopes of unseating U.S. Senator Lisa Murkowski], ''[[Alaska Dispatch News]], Nathaniel Herz and Erica Martinson, September 6, 2016.

==Career==
Miller served three years of active duty in the [[United States Army]]. An armor officer, he served in the [[34th Armor Regiment (United States)|2nd Battalion, 34th Armor Regiment]] within the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Infantry Division]]&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20101028220701/http://joemiller.us/about-2/candidate-records/&lt;/ref&gt; at [[Fort Riley]], [[Kansas]].&lt;ref name="deep Kan. roots"/&gt; In 1991 Miller deployed to the Persian [[Gulf War]], where he served as a leader of a [[tank]] platoon that helped drive [[Saddam Hussein]]'s army from [[Kuwait]].&lt;ref name="restive"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/07/nation/la-na-alaska-miller-20100907|title=For Alaska's restive right, it's Joe Miller time|date=September 7, 2010|author=Kim Murphy|newspaper= Los Angeles Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; His superiors called him "a true warrior leader tested under fire"&lt;ref name="restive"/&gt; and he received a [[Bronze Star]] for leadership in combat.&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; He has a service-connected hearing loss.&lt;ref name="out to change"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adn.com/2010/10/29/1526299/joe-miller-out-to-change-dc.html|title=Joe Miller: Out to change D.C.|author=Sean Cockerham|date=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was honorably discharged on September 1, 1992,&lt;ref name="web.archive.org"/&gt; during a time when the U.S. was downsizing its military.&lt;ref name="out to change"/&gt; He then served in the [[United States Army Reserve|U.S. Army Reserve]] until his honorable discharge on May 30, 1997.&lt;ref&gt;https://web.archive.org/web/20101028232613/http://joemiller.us/download/Honorable_Discharge_Army_Reserves.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

Following his discharge from active duty, Miller attended [[Yale Law School]], where he was a member of the flagship chapter of the [[Federalist Society]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://alaskadispatch.com/dispatches/politics/6617-at-yale-law-school-joe-miller-discovers-federalist-society|title=At Yale Law School, Joe Miller discovers Federalist Society|author=Joshua Saul and Amanda Coyne|publisher=''Alaska Dispatch''|date=August 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; He moved to Alaska in 1995 after earning his law degree, and accepted a position with Condon Partnow &amp; Sharrock, a [[law firm]] in [[Anchorage]].&lt;ref name="FNM01"&gt;{{cite news|title=Fairbanks attorney files to run against Sen. Lisa Murkowski |newspaper=Fairbanks Daily News-Miner |date=April 19, 2010 |url=http://www.newsminer.com/view/full_story/7148533/article-Fairbanks-attorney-files-to-run-against-Sen--Lisa-Murkowski |author=Staff reporter |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uxxx3ehY?url=http://www.newsminer.com/view/full_story/7148533/article-Fairbanks-attorney-files-to-run-against-Sen--Lisa-Murkowski |archivedate=December 14, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During Miller's Senate campaign, Alaskan media criticized him for his 1995 sworn application in which he claimed to be indigent and a one-year continuous resident of Alaska to obtain a hunting and fishing license for $5, a $295 discount from the non-resident fee.&lt;ref name="license"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://alaskadispatch.com/voices/medred/6986-joe-millers-hunting-and-fishing-license-likely-violated-residency-requirement|title=Joe Miller's hunting and fishing license likely violated residency requirement|author=Craig Medred|date=September 28, 2010|newspaper=Alaska Dispatch}}&lt;/ref&gt; The campaign responded that Miller had been a full-time student the previous year living on student loans, and that he was an Alaska resident when he purchased the license.&lt;ref name="license"/&gt;

Miller was appointed a state court magistrate for the remote village of [[Tok, Alaska|Tok]], as well as a superior court master for the Alaska's Fourth Judicial District in 1998.&lt;ref name="FNM01"/&gt; During his U.S. Senate campaign, Miller, who had said federal entitlement programs are unconstitutional, was criticized for having received federal assistance from Medicaid and a federally funded Alaska health care program for low income families at this time of his life.

From 2002 to 2004 he also served as a part-time [[U.S. magistrate judge]], employing his wife for part of that time as a clerical assistant.&lt;ref name="FNM01"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Nepotism&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.ktuu.com/2010-10-04/nepotism_24130018|title=Miller responds to allegations of nepotism |date=October 4, 2010|publisher=KTUU-TV|author=Rhonda McBride|accessdate=September 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, while Miller was being scrutinized by the media, allegations were made that he had violated nepotism rules by hiring his wife, and he was criticized because she collected unemployment compensation after being forced to quit the job.

Miller spent seven years as a part-time assistant attorney for the [[Fairbanks North Star Borough, Alaska|Fairbanks North Star Borough]] (2002–2009) while maintaining a private law practice from which he earned the bulk of his income.&lt;ref name="YardleyNYT93"/&gt; One of his major cases as borough assistant attorney involved successfully defending the borough's levy of a tax increase on the companies that own the [[Trans-Alaska Pipeline System|Trans-Alaska Pipeline]].&lt;ref name="YardleyNYT93"/&gt; In 2008 he misused the borough's computers for political purposes (to pad a poll as part of his campaign for Republican Party state chair).&lt;ref name="Ex-mayor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adn.com/2010/10/13/1500580/borough-mayor-calls-miller-dishonest.html|title=Ex-mayor says Miller disciplined over ethics|date=October 14, 2010|work=Anchorage Daily News|author=Sean Cockerham and Richard Mauer}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==2004 and 2008 political activities==
In 2004 Miller ran for a seat in the [[Alaska House of Representatives]], winning the Republican primary.

===Republican primary election===
Miller announced his candidacy in April 2010 saying that the U.S. republic needed to be defended from a "head-long plunge into socialism and more government control".&lt;ref name="FNM01"/&gt; His chief opponent for the Republican nomination was incumbent U.S. Senator Murkowski. He quickly picked up endorsements from current and former Alaska politicians including State Senators Fred Dyson and [[John Coghill]], and State Representative [[Tammie Wilson]].&lt;ref name="FNM01"/&gt; Former Governor [[Sarah Palin]] endorsed Miller's candidacy in early June 2010.&lt;ref name="Palin endorses"&gt;{{cite news|title=Palin Endorses GOP Challenger in Alaska Senate|agency=Associated Press |newspaper=U.S. News &amp; World Report|author=AP staff reporter|date=June 3, 2010|url=http://politics.usnews.com/news/articles/2010/06/03/palin-endorses-gop-challenger-in-alaska-senate.html|accessdate=November 5, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Tea Party Express]] began funding TV, radio, and direct mail ads on Miller's behalf shortly after,&lt;ref name="a test"/&gt; spending $600,000 on what the ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' called a "blitz" of "attack ads" against Murkowski.&lt;ref name="behind defeat"&gt;{{cite news|title='Tea party' group behind defeat of GOP Senate incumbent in Alaska|date=September 1, 2010|url=http://articles.latimes.com/2010/sep/01/nation/la-na-alaska-vote-20100902|work=[[Los Angeles Times]]|accessdate=September 2, 2010|authors=Kathleen Hennessey and Michael A.

Miller won the August 24 primary by garnering 1,668 more votes than Murkowski, according to the initial count. Murkowski did not concede until one week later when, after more than 15,000 absentee and other uncounted ballots were tallied, she still remained 1,630 votes behind Miller.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.foxnews.com/us/2010/08/31/sen-lisa-murkowski-concedes-alaska-primary-race-joe-miller/|title=US Sen.

===General election===

After securing the Republican Party nomination, he received backing from the state Republican Party, Senator [[Jim DeMint]], and the [[National Republican Senatorial Committee]].&lt;ref name="refuses to answer"/&gt; Various groups from outside Alaska endorsed Miller and contributed large sums of money to his general election campaign, including the [[Tea Party Express]], the [[Safari Club International]], and the [[National Right to Life Committee]].&lt;ref name="draws additional"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://community.adn.com/adn/node/153506|title=Miller draws additional outside interest group money from hunting, anti-abortion interests|author=Erika Bolstad|newspaper=Anchorage Daily News|date=October 6, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alaska's only representative in the House, Republican [[Don Young]], declined to endorse either Murkowski or Miller.&lt;ref name="draws additional"/&gt; Sarah Palin appeared at a campaign rally with Miller for the first time in late October 2010.&lt;ref name="NYT10"/&gt;

During his general election campaign, Miller said he supported sharp reductions in federal spending and stronger states' rights.&lt;ref name="NYT10"/&gt;&lt;ref name="refuses to answer"/&gt; He told the Washington D.C. newspaper ''The Hill'' that the nation's problems were caused by [[judicial activism|activist judges]] who had permitted government growth and allowed dependency and "the entitlement state to grab hold".&lt;ref name="before election"&gt;{{cite news|author=Jordan Fabian|title=Before election, Miller eyes Senate posts|url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/116907-before-election-miller-eyes-committee-posts|date=September 2, 2010|work=[[The Hill (newspaper)|The Hill]]|accessdate=September 2, 2010|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uxy79Y1n?url=http://thehill.com/blogs/blog-briefing-room/news/116907-before-election-miller-eyes-committee-posts|archivedate=December 14, 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Democratic National Committee]] and other Democrats began painting him as a [[Far-right politics|far right]] candidate.&lt;ref name="before election"/&gt; Confident of his election, Miller told the media that he wanted to serve on the Senate Judiciary and Armed Services committees.&lt;ref name="before election"/&gt;

Following a mid-October leak of information about his work record as a borough attorney, Miller held a news conference telling reporters that he was drawing a line in the sand and would not answer any more questions about his past.&lt;ref name="refuses to answer"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sify.com/news/miller-refuses-to-answer-questions-about-past-news-international-kkoaa8hbgid.html|title=Miller refuses to answer questions about his past|author=Staff|date=October 14, 2010|agency=Associated Press|publisher=SiFy.com|archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5ueE5SHW4?url=http://sify.com/news/miller-refuses-to-answer-questions-about-past-news-international-kkoaa8hbgid.html|archivedate=December 1, 2010|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Journalist handcuffed====
Miller received national press attention after campaign security guards handcuffed and made a 30-minute private arrest of a [[Journalism|journalist]] following a [[Town hall meeting|town hall]] campaign event in an Anchorage public school on October 17, 2010.&lt;ref name=Handcuffed&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adn.com/2010/10/17/1506223/miller-security-guards-handcuff.html|title=Miller security guards handcuff journalist Public Event: Incident took place after town hall meeting at middle school|date=October 18, 2010|author=Richard Mauer|newspaper=Anchorage Daily News|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101019014343/http://www.adn.com/2010/10/17/1506223/miller-security-guards-handcuff.html|archivedate=October 19, 2010|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="News Editor"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://thecaucus.blogs.nytimes.com/2010/10/18/news-editor-detained-by-guards-for-alaska-senate-candidate/|title=News Editor Detained by Security Guards for Alaska Senate Candidate|author=William Yardley|date=October 18, 2010|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Guard&gt;{{cite news|title=Miller guard says editor refused to leave private event|url=http://alaskadispatch.com/dispatches/news/7187-miller-guard-says-editor-refused-to-leave-private-event|author=Craig Medred|publisher=''Alaska Dispatch''|date=October 17, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://alaskadispatch.com/dispatches/news/7186-alaska-dispatch-editor-detained-at-miller-event-updated|title=Dispatch editor detained at Miller event|date=October 17, 2010|author=Craig Medred|publisher=''Alaska Dispatch''}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=Journalist&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.ktuu.com/news/ktuu-2010elect-miller-security-hopfinger-arrest-101710,0,2454854.story|title=Miller security handcuffs journalist at town hall|date=October 17, 2010|author=Jackie Bartz|publisher=KTUU-TV}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Bill Fulton, the owner of the unlicensed security firm said the journalist, Tony Hopfinger, was trespassing at a private event and had assaulted a Miller supporter by shoving him. Fulton was subsequently named as the federal informant who supplied weapons to a radical accused of plotting the deaths of officials in Fairbanks.&lt;ref name=Handcuffed/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guard/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/bill-fulton/2011/11/ |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2011-12-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120413020828/http://tpmmuckraker.talkingpointsmemo.com/bill-fulton/2011/11/ |archivedate=2012-04-13 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''Anchorage Daily News'' described the event as public,&lt;ref name=Handcuffed/&gt; and a school district spokesperson noted that the hallway where the arrest took place was a public area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Mauer|url=http://www.adn.com/2010/10/18/1507982/questions-surround-use-of-security.html|title=Miller bodyguards at forum included active-duty soldiers|newspaper=Anchorage Daily News|date=October 18, 2010|accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopfinger said he had been trying to ask Miller whether he had been disciplined while working as a local government lawyer,&lt;ref name=Journalist/&gt; when he was suddenly surrounded by guards and supporters, and bumped or shoved against one of them.&lt;ref name="News Editor"/&gt;&lt;ref name=Guard/&gt; No charges were filed against anyone in relation to the incident.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Richard Mauer|url=http://www.adn.com/2010/10/19/1509238/no-charges-to-be-filed-after-sunday.html|title=City won't prosecute in Miller forum scuffle|newspaper=Anchorage Daily News|date=October 20, 2010|accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller responded that Hopfinger's actions were "beyond the pale" because he had followed Miller into the men's room.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Matt Felling |url=http://www.ktva.com/ci_16370971?source=pkg|title=Miller: Blogger Followed "Me into the Bathroom" |publisher=KTVA |date=October 18, 2010|accessdate=October 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hopfinger said that he asked no questions until after the townhall event when both men were back in the hallway.&lt;ref name=Guard/&gt;

After the incident, Miller granted interviews and discussed certain issues regarding his past employment with national news outlets, though he had previously refused to discuss the same issues with the Alaskan media.&lt;ref name="admits to"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|author=Sean Cockerham|url=http://www.adn.com/2010/10/18/1507733/miller-admits-borough-disciplined.html|title=Miller admits he was disciplined by borough over computer use|newspaper=Anchorage Daily News|date=October 19, 2010|accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The information about Miller's discipline and suspension that Hopfinger was attempting to ask Miller about was released by the borough on October 26, in response to a lawsuit filed by several Alaska news organizations.&lt;ref name="ad"/&gt;

====Allegations of media bias====
In late October 2010, Sarah Palin announced on [[Fox News Channel]] that the Anchorage CBS-TV affiliate, KTVA, had been conspiring to make up stories about Miller and that the campaign had proof.&lt;ref name="cancels 2"&gt;{{cite news|title=KTVA-TV cancels 2 newscasts so staff can discuss ethics, VOICE MAIL: Channel 11 staffers address trust issues in wake of bias accusations|author=Casey Grove|date=November 11, 2010|url=http://www.adn.com/2010/11/10/1547664/ktva-cancels-newscasts-so-staff.html#ixzz154XUMLLp|accessdate=November 12, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; It seemed that KTVA personnel had failed to hang up a phone after leaving a message for Miller's campaign spokesman and that their later comments were recorded on the spokesman's voicemail.&lt;ref name="firestorm"&gt;{{cite news|author=Vauhini Vara|url=https://blogs.wsj.com/washwire/2010/10/31/phone-recording-sets-off-firestorm-in-alaska|title=Phone Recording Sets Off Firestorm in Alaska|newspaper=The Wall Street Journal|date=October 31, 2010|accessdate=November 3, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; During the conversation, they laughingly considered [[Twitter|tweeting]] about chaos at a Miller rally, and falsely reporting that sex offenders were there.&lt;ref name="firestorm"/&gt; The station's general manager initially took no action, saying the remarks were taken out of context,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|author=Greg Sargent|title = Alaska station says Breitbart Web site audio attack is bogus|newspaper=The Washington Post|date=October 31, 2010|url=http://voices.washingtonpost.com/plum-line/2010/10/alaska_station_denies_big_gove.html|accessdate=November 1, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but he later fired two producers involved, and canceled two newscasts to hold a staff meeting discussing ethics in journalism.&lt;ref name="cancels 2"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://articles.ktuu.com/2010-11-02/alaska-cbs_24811178|title=KTVA fires 2 producers over Miller voicemail|author=Jackie Bartz|date=November 2, 2010|publisher=KTUU}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller hoped to win the Senate seat by means of a federal lawsuit that he filed on November 9, 2010. He alleged that Alaska election officials were violating the [[Article One of the United States Constitution#Section 4: Congressional elections|Elections Clause]] of the U.S. Constitution and the [[Equal Protection Clause]] of the 14th Amendment because they were using a voter intent standard to determine which ballots to count for Murkowski. He argued that the State statute regarding write-in votes should be strictly applied and asked the federal court to throw out all the ballots that misspelled the name "Murkowski", or that did not write in Murkowski's name exactly as it appeared on the list of write-in candidates.&lt;ref name="no leeway"/&gt;&lt;ref name="spell check"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adn.com/2010/11/10/1548282/senator-leading-as-write-ins-counted.html|title=98 percent of write-in votes go to Murkowski, SPELL CHECK: Despite objections from Miller's team, most Murkowski votes are being accepted|author=Sean Cockerham|date=November 10, 2010|newspaper=Anchorage Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He cited an Alaska election statute that states: ''"The rules set out in this section are mandatory and there are no exceptions to them. A ballot may not be counted unless marked in compliance with these rules."''&lt;ref&gt;Alaska Stat. § 15.15.360. : Alaska Statutes – Section 15.15.360.: Rules for counting ballots.&lt;/ref&gt; Election officials said that state [[case law]] allowed them to use discretion in counting ballots with misspellings or other variations.&lt;ref name="Miller camp files"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.usatoday.com/news/politics/2010-11-10-alaska-senate-lawsuit_N.htm|title=Joe Miller camp files suit over Alaska write-in ballots|author=Staff|agency=Associated Press|newspaper=USA Today|date=November 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first judge assigned to the case recused himself because he said he had a negative opinion of Miller dating to 2004 when he was Miller's judicial supervisor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Judge with 'negative opinion' of Miller bows out of write-in case, QUIT: Republican nominee left his job without notice when Sedwick was his supervisor|url=http://www.adn.com/2010/11/10/1547601/judge-with-negative-opinion-of.html#ixzz14y7Zq6Im|author=Richard Mauer|publisher=Anchorage Daily News|date=November 11, 2010|accessdate=November 11, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller filed a [[preliminary injunction]] as part of the suit, asking that the federal judge immediately order the State to stop counting the ballots, due to irreparable harm that would happen if the counting continued, but the request was denied.&lt;ref name="spell check"/&gt;&lt;ref name="injunction denied"&gt;{{cite news|title=Injunction denied for write-in vote count|agency=Associated Press|author=AP staff reporter|date=November 10, 2010|url=http://www.adn.com/2010/11/10/1547438/judge-denies-injunction-for-alaska.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The votes challenged by Miller's team were put in separate boxes, leaving it to the lawsuit to decide whether they would be counted for Murkowski.&lt;ref name="spell check"/&gt; On November 11, the Miller campaign alleged it had received reports of voter intimidation and fraud and that it would be filing a lawsuit in Alaska state court asking for voters rolls for certain precincts to determine whether the precincts had counted more ballots than there were registered voters.&lt;ref name="plans to sue"/&gt; Miller told [[Fox News Channel]] on November 18 that his campaign may request a recount, investigate the voting machines, and look into whether the absentee ballots for the military were mailed in a timely fashion.&lt;ref name="triumphs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="AP calls"/&gt; The federal judge held the suit could be decided by reference to State law, and directed Miller to file in State court, which he did on November 22, stopping the certification of election results and possibly delaying the seating of a second Senator for Alaska at the beginning of the new term in January.&lt;ref name="files vote-count"/&gt;&lt;ref name="candidate Joe"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://vancouversun.com/news/Alaska+candidate+Miller+sues+over+Senate+election+results/3868930/story.html|title=Alaska candidate Joe Miller sues over Senate election results|author=Yareth Rosen|agency=Reuters|date=November 22, 2010|newspaper=Vancouver Sun}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller's Alaska state court lawsuit essentially repeated his federal suit allegations, but added new charges of voter fraud, claiming that precinct election officials had allowed voting without proper identification, and claiming that identical handwriting was suspiciously found on multiple ballots, which was also a violation of the requirement that a voter must personally pen a write-in ballot.&lt;ref name="files vote-count"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adn.com/2010/11/22/1567823/miller-files-vote-suit-in-state.html|title=Miller files suit in state court over Senate vote court STATE COURT: New claims focus on handwriting and lack of voter identification|author=Richard Mauer|date=November 22, 2010|newspaper=Anchorage Daily News}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller offered a new argument at a December 8 hearing; that hundreds of convicted sex offenders and possibly other felons were allowed to vote in the November election. On December 10, the Alaska Superior Court ruled against all of Miller's claims, finding the hand count of the write-in ballots valid.&lt;ref name="judge rules"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.adn.com/article/20101210/judge-rules-against-miller-suit-over-senate-election|title=Judge rules against Miller in Senate suit|author=Sean Cockerham|newspaper=Anchorage Daily News|date=December 10, 2010|accessdate=Sep 18, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The court said that the State statute does not require perfect spelling, and said that if the State legislature intended exact spelling it, would have said so.&lt;ref name="judge rules"/&gt; The emphasis, the court said, should be on making sure voters are not disenfranchised.&lt;ref name="judge rules"/&gt;&lt;ref name="court rejects"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.juneaublogger.com/updates/?p=6664|title=Court rejects Miller's election challenge|author=Pat Forgey|newspaper=Juneau Empire|date=December 10, 2010|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110713125154/http://www.juneaublogger.com/updates/?p=6664|archivedate=July 13, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The judge also wrote, "To allow for write-in votes with less than a perfect spelling of a candidate's name, as long as voter intent is clear ...[is] a commonsense interpretation, which the court believes would be evident to most Alaskans".&lt;ref name="court rejects"/&gt; The judge also rejected Miller's demands for a hand count of all the ballots cast in the election, not just those with write-in votes, because state law did not provide for it.&lt;ref name="court rejects"/&gt;

He dismissed Miller's claims of possible vote fraud as based on speculation, "Miller's affidavits do not provide any facts of wrongful conduct at polling stations and not even circumstantial evidence of wrongdoing," he said.&lt;ref name="court rejects"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://politicalticker.blogs.cnn.com/2010/12/10/breaking-alaska-superior-court-rules-against-joe-miller|title=BREAKING: Alaska Superior Court rules against Joe Miller|work=cnn.com|accessdate=2010-12-10|date=December 10, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Miller campaign responded to the ruling by stating that votes that did not meet the standard established by the state legislature were not valid, and that that equal protection and fundamental fairness required a hand count of all the votes and an investigation of fraud allegations.&lt;ref name="judge rules"/&gt; The judge allowed a brief stay so that Miller could appeal to the Alaska Supreme Court.&lt;ref name="expect Friday"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://alaskadispatch.com/dispatches/news/7767-judge-expect-friday-ruling-on-alaska-senate-race|title=Judge: Friday ruling on Alaska Senate race|author=Patti Epler|date=December 8, 2010|publisher=Alaska Dispatch}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 22, 2010, the Alaska Supreme Court upheld a lower court decision and denied Miller's suit. The high court, in its ruling, called voter intent "paramount," and said "any misspelling, abbreviation, or other minor variation in the form of the candidate's name on a write-in ballot does not invalidate a ballot so long as the intention of the voter can be ascertained." and "The State characterizes the standard urged by Miller as the 'perfection standard,' and we agree that such a standard would tend to disenfranchise many Alaskans on the basis of 'technical errors".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/alaska-high-court-throws-out-joe-miller-claims/|title=Alaska high court throws out Miller claims|work=AP|accessdate=January 8, 2014|date=Dec 22, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.touchngo.com/sp/html/sp-6532.htm Miller v. Treadwell (12/22/2010)]&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 28, U.S. District Judge Ralph Beistline dismissed Miller's claim and allowed certification of the election of Senator Lisa Murkowski to go forward without delay.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|last=Demer |first=Lisa |title=Court Rejects Miller: Lifts Certification Hold |newspaper=Anchorage Daily News |date=December 28, 2010 |url=http://www.adn.com/2010/12/28/1622554/federal-judge-overturns-miller.html |accessdate=January 8, 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20140108092615/http://www.adn.com/2010/12/28/1622554/federal-judge-overturns-miller.html |archivedate=January 8, 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On December 30, 2010, Alaska state officials certified the election of Lisa Murkowski as the winner of the Senatorial election, making her the first U.S. Senate candidate to win election via write-in since [[Strom Thurmond]] [[United States Senate election in South Carolina, 1954|in 1954]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=December 30, 2010|url=http://www.adn.com/2010/12/30/1625216/state-set-to-certify-alaska-senate.html|accessdate=December 30, 2010|title=Murkowski certified Senate election winner|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110101192617/http://www.adn.com/2010/12/30/1625216/state-set-to-certify-alaska-senate.html|archivedate=January 1, 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Miller conceded the race on December 31.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|date=December 31, 2010|url=http://www.politicsdaily.com/2010/12/31/joe-miller-ends-legal-challenge-to-murkowski-in-alaska-senate-ra/|accessdate=January 8, 2014|title=Joe Miller Ends Legal Challenge to Lisa Murkowski's Win in Alaska Senate Race}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 2011, a judge found that Miller's lawsuit was aimed at winning the election and not in the interest of upholding the state constitution as Miller had claimed. He was ordered to compensate the State of Alaska approximately $18,000 for legal fees incurred by the State.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.alaskapublic.org/2011/06/24/judge-orders-joe-miller-to-pay-legal-fees-from-election-challenge/ Judge Orders Joe Miller to Pay Legal Fees from Election Challenge] Associated Press/Alaska Public Radio Network 6/24/2011&lt;/ref&gt;

Miller ran in the [[United States Senate election in Alaska, 2014| 2014 U.S. Senate election]] as a Republican, although a late-race endorsement of Miller by former governor [[Sarah Palin]] did not yield a win, as former Alaska Attorney General and Commissioner of Natural Resources [[Daniel S.

'''Johannes van Damme''' (1 June 1935 – 23 September 1994) was a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] [[engineer]] and [[businessman]] executed in [[Singapore]] for [[Illegal drug trade|drug trafficking]]. He was the first [[Europe]]an to be [[Capital punishment|executed]] in Singapore since its independence.

==Biography==
Van Damme had lived in [[Nigeria]] for a while and was married to a Nigerian woman at the time of his arrest. He was arrested on September 27, 1991, at [[Singapore Changi Airport]]. In a secret compartment of his trunk, {{convert|4.32|kg}} of heroin was found. Van Damme claimed he had been framed by his Nigerian engineer partner, but this claim was rejected by the court. In November 1993, his [[appeal]] was rejected, and the sentence was upheld. A plea for [[clemency]] from the Dutch government was rejected by the [[President of Singapore]], [[Ong Teng Cheong]], and nor could a letter from [[Beatrix of the Netherlands|Queen Beatrix]] sent to the President prevent Van Damme from being executed.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/12740893.Last_ditch_appeals_fail_to_save_drugs_man_from_gallows/ Last-ditch appeals fail to save drugs man from gallows], ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'', 23 September 1994&lt;/ref&gt; 

He was hanged at [[Changi Prison]] on the morning of Friday, September 23, 1994, between 6:30&amp;nbsp;a.m. and 7:00&amp;nbsp;a.m.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Singapore Executes a Dutch Engineer Arrested on Drug Charges|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1994/09/24/world/singapore-executes-a-dutch-engineer-arrested-on-drug-charges.html?scp=1|accessdate=4 July 2011|newspaper=New York Times|date=24 September 1994}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was his case, along with that of [[Mat Repin]] (executed by hanging on 13 May 1994 at Changi prison for having smuggled 1&amp;nbsp;kg of cannabis from [[Malaysia]]).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.refworld.org/docid/3ae6aa0c18.html Amnesty International Report 1995 - Singapore],&lt;/ref&gt;) which prompted science fiction author [[William Gibson]] to 
describe [[Singapore]] as [[Disneyland with the Death Penalty]], the title of in his first major non-fiction piece which was first published by ''[[Wired (magazine)|Wired]]'' magazine in its September/October 1993 issue (1.4).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Disneyland With the Death Penalty|url=https://www.wired.com/1993/04/gibson-2/|accessdate=6 December 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The article had an immediate and lasting impact. The Singapore government banned ''Wired'' upon the publication of the issue, and the phrase "Disneyland with the death penalty" became a byword for bland authoritarianism that the city-state could not easily discard.

[[General of the Armies]] '''John Joseph''' "'''Black Jack'''" '''Pershing''' (September 13, 1860 – July 15, 1948) was a senior [[United States Army]] [[Officer (armed forces)|officer]]. His most famous post was when he served as the commander of the [[American Expeditionary Forces]] (AEF) on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]] in [[World War I]], 1917–18.

Pershing rejected British and French demands that American forces be integrated with their armies, and insisted that the AEF would operate as a single unit under his command, although some American divisions fought under British command, and he also allowed all-black units to be integrated with the [[French army]].

Pershing's soldiers first saw serious battle at [[Cantigny, Somme|Cantigny]], [[Battle of Château-Thierry (1918)|Chateau-Thierry]], [[Battle of Belleau Wood|Belleau Wood]], and [[Battle of Soissons (1918)|Soissons]]. To speed up the arrival of the [[doughboy]]s, they embarked for France leaving the heavy equipment behind, and used British and French tanks, artillery, airplanes and other munitions. In September 1918 at [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel|St. Mihiel]], the [[First United States Army|First Army]] was directly under Pershing's command; it overwhelmed the [[Salients, re-entrants and pockets|salient]] – the encroachment into [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] territory – that the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] had held for three years. For the [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive]], Pershing shifted roughly 600,000 American soldiers to the heavily defended forests of the Argonne, keeping his divisions engaged in hard fighting for 47 days, alongside the French. The [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] [[Hundred Days Offensive]], which the Argonne fighting was part of, contributed to Germany calling for an [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|armistice]]. Pershing was of the opinion that the war should continue and that all of [[Germany]] should be occupied in an effort to permanently destroy German militarism.

Pershing is the only American to be promoted in his own lifetime to [[General of the Armies]] rank, the highest possible rank in the United States Army.&lt;ref group=Notes&gt;An act was passed in 1976 retroactively promoting [[George Washington]] to the same rank but with higher seniority, ensuring that he would always be considered the senior ranking officer in the United States Army.&lt;/ref&gt; Allowed to select his own insignia, Pershing chose to use [[General of the Armies#John Pershing|four gold stars]] to distinguish himself from those officers who held the rank of [[General (United States)|General]], which was signified with four silver stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |date=April 18, 1925 |title=Lest We Forget: Over There; The Reduction of the Marne Salient |url=https://www.newspapers.com/image/83256506/ |newspaper=The Evening Star |location=Franklin, IN |page=7 |subscription=yes |quote= ... and the boys stood in formation from noon till evening before the arrival of the automobile bearing the impressive insignia of four gold stars. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20170116131222/https://www.newspapers.com/image/83256506/ |archivedate=January 16, 2017 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  After the creation of the five-star [[General of the Army (United States)|General of the Army]] rank during [[World War II]], his rank of General of the Armies could unofficially be considered that of a [[six-star general]], but he died before the proposed insignia could be considered and acted on by [[United States Congress|Congress]].

Some of his tactics have been criticized both by other commanders at the time and by modern historians. His reliance on costly [[frontal assault]]s, long after other Allied armies had abandoned such tactics, has been blamed for causing unnecessarily high American casualties.&lt;ref&gt;Sheffield, G. (2001). ''Forgotten Victory: The First World War: Myths and Realities'' (2002 ed.). London: Headline Book Publishing. {{ISBN|0-7472-7157-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In addition to leading the A.E.F. to victory in World War I, Pershing notably served as a mentor to many in the generation of generals who led the United States Army during [[World War II]], including [[George Marshall]], [[Dwight D. Eisenhower]], [[Omar Bradley]], [[Lesley J. McNair]], [[George S. Patton]], and [[Douglas MacArthur]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Tucker |first=Spencer C. |date=2014 |title=World War I: The Definitive Encyclopedia and Document Collection |volume=1 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=DBwTBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1238&amp;dq=%22pershing%22+%22macarthur%22+%22mentor%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI7I-rpbzLAhXIdR4KHVtsCgcQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pershing%22%20%22macarthur%22%20%22mentor%22&amp;f=false |location=Santa Barbara, CA |publisher=ABC-CLIO |page=1238 |isbn=978-1-85109-964-1 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160430011411/https://books.google.com/books?id=DBwTBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA1238&amp;dq=%22pershing%22+%22macarthur%22+%22mentor%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjI7I-rpbzLAhXIdR4KHVtsCgcQ6AEIIjAB#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pershing%22%20%22macarthur%22%20%22mentor%22&amp;f=false |archivedate=April 30, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Keane |first=Michael |date=2012 |title=George S.

==Early life==
Pershing was born on a farm near [[Laclede, Missouri]], to businessman John Fletcher Pershing and homemaker Ann Elizabeth Thompson. Pershing's great-great-grandfather, Frederick Pershing, whose name originally was Pfersching, [[Alsatians (people)|emigrated from Alsace]], leaving [[Amsterdam]] on the ship ''Jacob'', and arriving in [[Philadelphia]] on October 2, 1749. Pershing's mother was of [[English American|English descent]]. He also had five siblings: brothers James F. (1862–1933) and  Ward (1874–1909), and sisters Mary Elizabeth (1864–1928), Anna May (1867–1955) and Grace (1867–1903); three other children died in infancy.&lt;ref&gt;Ruth and Rose, twins who died in 1872, and Frederick, who died in 1876.

Pershing attended a school in Laclede that was reserved for precocious students who were also the children of prominent citizens.  Completing high school in 1878, he became a teacher of local [[African American]] children.  While pursuing his teaching career, Pershing also studied at the State [[Normal School]] (now [[Truman State University]]) in [[Kirksville, Missouri]], from which he graduated in 1880 with a [[bachelor of science]] degree in [[Didactic method|scientific didactics]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Russell |first=Thomas Herbert |date=1919 |title=America's War for Humanity: Pictorial History of the World War for Liberty |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=CVs-AQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA497 |location=New York, NY |publisher=L.H.

Pershing later admitted that serving in the military was secondary to attending West Point, and he had applied because the education offered was better than that obtainable in rural Missouri.

==Early career==
Pershing reported for active duty on September 30, 1886, and was assigned to Troop L of the [[6th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|6th U.S. Cavalry]] stationed at [[Fort Bayard National Cemetery|Fort Bayard]], in the [[New Mexico Territory]]. While serving in the 6th Cavalry, Pershing participated in several [[American Indian Wars|Indian campaigns]] and was cited for bravery for actions against the [[Apache]]. During his time at [[Fort Stanton]], Pershing and close friends Lt. Julius Penn and Lt. [[Richard B. Paddock]] were nicknamed "The Three Green P's," spending their leisure time hunting and attending Hispanic dances. Pershing's sister Grace married Paddock in 1890.&lt;ref name=vandiver1&gt;Vandiver, v.1, p. 67.&lt;/ref&gt;

Between 1887 and 1890, Pershing served with the 6th Cavalry at various postings in [[California]], [[Arizona]], and [[North Dakota]]. He also became an expert marksman and, in 1891, was rated second in pistol and fifth in rifle out of all soldiers in the U.S. Army.

On December 9, 1890, Pershing and the 6th Cavalry arrived at [[Sioux City, Iowa]], where Pershing played a role in suppressing the last uprisings of the [[Sioux|Lakota (Sioux)]] [[Native Americans in the United States|Indians]]. Though he and his unit did not participate in the [[Wounded Knee Massacre]], they did fight three days after it on January 1, 1891 when Sioux warriors attacked the 6th Cavalry's supply wagons. When the Sioux began firing at the wagons, Pershing and his troops heard the shots, and rode more than six miles to the location of the attack. The cavalry fired at the forces of Chief War Eagle, causing them to retreat. This would be the only occasion where Pershing would see action in the [[Ghost Dance War|Ghost Dance campaign]].&lt;ref name="WK"&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=JccTct3j3DUC&amp;pg=PA39&amp;dq=John+J.+Pershing+wounded+knee&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=7OfNTrS-KarW0QGD3ungBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwAA#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=John J.

In September 1891 he was assigned as the Professor of Military Science and Tactics at the [[University of Nebraska-Lincoln]], a position he held until 1895. While carrying out this assignment, Pershing attended the university's [[University of Nebraska College of Law|College of Law]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |last=MacAdam |first=George |date=March 1, 1919 |title=The Life of General Pershing |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=r0RYAAAAYAAJ&amp;pg=PA543 |magazine=The World's Work |location=Garden City, NY |publisher=Doubleday, Page &amp; Company |page=543 }}&lt;/ref&gt; from which he received his [[bachelor of laws|LL.B.]] degree in 1893.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite magazine |date=April 1, 1920 |title=Alumni in the Primaries |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=VeDmAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA6 |magazine=The University Journal |location=Lincoln, NE |publisher=University of Nebraska |page=6}}&lt;/ref&gt; He formed a drill company of chosen university cadets, Company A.  In March 1892, it won the Maiden Prize competition of the National Competitive Drills in [[Omaha, Nebraska]]. The Citizens of Omaha presented the company with a large silver cup, the "Omaha Cup." On October 2, 1894, former members of Company A established a fraternal military drill organization named the Varsity Rifles. The group renamed itself the [[Pershing Rifles]] in 1895 in honor of its mentor and patron.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Gen. John J.

In 1897, Pershing was appointed to the West Point tactical staff as an instructor, where he was assigned to Cadet Company A. Because of his strictness and rigidity, Pershing was unpopular with the cadets, who took to calling him &lt;!--SEE NOTE--&gt;"[[Nigger]] Jack"&lt;!--NOTE: *Extensive* discussions about Pershing's nickname can be found in the archives, especially http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:John_J._Pershing/Archive_2 and http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Talk:John_J._Pershing/Archive_3.

==Spanish– and Philippine–American wars==
At the start of the [[Spanish–American War]], First Lieutenant Pershing was the regimental quartermaster for the 10th Cavalry; he fought on Kettle and [[Battle of San Juan Hill|San Juan Hill]]s in [[Cuba]], and was cited for gallantry. In 1919, he was awarded the [[Citation Star|Silver Citation Star]] for these actions, and in 1932 the award was upgraded to the [[Silver Star]] decoration. A commanding officer here commented on Pershing's calm demeanor under fire, saying he was "cool as a bowl of cracked ice.".&lt;ref name=boot&gt;Boot, p. 191&lt;/ref&gt;  Pershing also served with the 10th Cavalry during the siege and surrender of [[Santiago de Cuba]].

Pershing was commissioned as a major of United States Volunteers on August 26, 1898, and assigned as an ordnance officer.  In March 1899, after suffering from [[malaria]], Pershing was put in charge of the Office of Customs and Insular Affairs which oversaw occupation forces in territories gained in the Spanish–American War, including Cuba, [[Puerto Rico]], the [[Philippines]], and [[Guam]]. &lt;!--In the Philippines, he would be partly responsible for "inflicting thousands of civilian casualties"&lt;ref name="http://www.law.umaryland.edu/marshall/crsreports/crsdocuments/rl31672_11182003.pdf"&gt;CRS Report for Congress: Terrorism in Southeast Asia Updated November 18, 2003.

He was again commissioned as a major of Volunteers on June 6, 1899, this time as an assistant adjutant general.

When the [[Philippine–American War]] began, Pershing reported to Manila on August 17, 1899, was assigned to the Department of [[Mindanao]] and [[Jolo]], and commanded efforts to suppress the [[Filipino Insurrection]].&lt;ref name=Rojas&gt;{{cite web|last=Rojas|first=Julietta|title=John J.

The bodies were publicly buried in the same grave with a dead pig. It was not pleasant to have to take such measures, but the prospect of going to hell instead of heaven sometimes deterred the would-be assassins." A footnote in the 2013 edition cites a letter from Maj. Gen. J. Franklin Bell to Pershing: "Of course there is nothing to be done, but I understand it has long been a custom to bury (insurgents) with pigs when they kill Americans. I think this a good plan, for if anything will discourage the (insurgents) it is the prospect of going to hell instead of to heaven. You can rely on me to stand by you in maintaining this custom.

On June 30, 1901, Pershing was honorably discharged from the Volunteers and he reverted to the rank of captain in the [[Regular Army (United States)|Regular Army]] to which he had been promoted on February 2, 1901. He served with the [[1st Cavalry Regiment (United States)|1st Cavalry Regiment]] in the Philippines. He later was assigned to the [[15th Cavalry Regiment (United States)|15th Cavalry Regiment]], serving as an intelligence officer and participating in actions [[Moro Rebellion|against the Moros]]. He was cited for bravery at [[Lake Lanao]]. In June 1901, he served as Commander of Camp Vicars in Lanao, Philippines, after the previous camp commander had been promoted to [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]].

==Rise to general==
In June 1903, Pershing was ordered to return to the United States. President [[Theodore Roosevelt]], taken by Pershing's ability, petitioned the Army General Staff to promote Pershing to [[Colonel (United States)|colonel]]. At the time, Army officer promotions were based primarily on seniority rather than merit,&lt;ref name=boot /&gt; and although there was widespread acknowledgment that Pershing should serve as a colonel, the Army General Staff declined to change their seniority-based promotion tradition just to accommodate Pershing. They would not consider a promotion to [[Lieutenant colonel (United States)|lieutenant colonel]] or even [[Major (United States)|major]]. This angered Roosevelt, but since the President could only name and promote army officers in the General ranks, his options for recognizing Pershing through promotion were limited.

[[File:Leon Hornecker-general-Pershing.jpg|thumb|left|175px|Portrait of Captain Pershing by [[Léon Hornecker]] (1903)]]

In 1904, Pershing was assigned as the Assistant Chief of Staff of the Southwest Army Division stationed at [[Oklahoma City, Oklahoma]]. In October 1904, he attended the [[United States Army War College|Army War College]], and then was ordered to [[Washington, D.C.]] for "general duties unassigned."

Since Roosevelt could not yet promote Pershing, he petitioned the [[United States Congress]] to authorize a diplomatic posting, and Pershing was stationed as [[military attaché]] in [[Tokyo]] in 1905. Also in 1905, Pershing married Helen Frances Warren, the daughter of powerful [[United States Senate|U.S. Senator]] [[Francis E. Warren]], a [[Wyoming]] [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] who served at different times as chairman of the [[United States Senate Committee on Armed Services|Military Affairs]] and [[United States Senate Committee on Appropriations|Appropriations]] Committees. This union with the daughter of a powerful politician who had also received the [[Medal of Honor]] during the [[American Civil War]] continued to aid Pershing's career even after his wife died in 1915.&lt;ref name="arlington"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.warren.af.mil/library/factsheets/factsheet.asp?id=4696 |title=F.

President Roosevelt employed his presidential prerogative and nominated Pershing as a [[Brigadier general (United States)|brigadier general]], a move which Congress approved.

In 1908, Pershing briefly served as a U.S. military observer in the [[Balkans]], an assignment which was based in [[Paris]]. Upon returning to the United States at the end of 1909, Pershing was assigned once again to the Philippines, an assignment in which he served until 1913. While in the Philippines, he served as Commander of [[Fort William McKinley|Fort McKinley]], near Manila, and also was the governor of the Moro Province. The last of Pershing's four children was born in the Philippines, and during this time he became an [[Episcopal Church (United States)|Episcopalian]].

In 1913 Pershing was recommended for the [[Medal of Honor]] following his actions at the [[Battle of Bud Bagsak]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arnold |first=James R. |date=2011 |title=The Moro War: How America Battled a Muslim Insurgency in the Philippine Jungle, 1902–1913 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=S1Q5OYAPccoC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=%22pershing%22+%22medal+of+honor%22+%22bagsak%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zYU6VdjsIMOHNp7BgKAC&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pershing%22%20%22medal%20of%20honor%22%20%22bagsak%22&amp;f=false |location=New York, NY |publisher=Bloomsbury Press |page=240 |isbn=978-1-60819-024-9 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151125040155/https://books.google.com/books?id=S1Q5OYAPccoC&amp;pg=PA240&amp;dq=%22pershing%22+%22medal+of+honor%22+%22bagsak%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=zYU6VdjsIMOHNp7BgKAC&amp;ved=0CDkQ6AEwBQ#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pershing%22%20%22medal%20of%20honor%22%20%22bagsak%22&amp;f=false |archivedate=November 25, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  He wrote to the [[List of Adjutants General of the U.S. Army|Adjutant General]] to request that the recommendation not be acted on, though the board which considered the recommendation had already voted no before receiving Pershing's letter.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=MacAdam |first=George |date=1919 |title=The Life of General Pershing: The World's Work, Volume 38 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=6uRAAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=%22pershing%22+%22medal+of+honor%22+%22jolo%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=poM6Ve7rOYLTggTv9oCQCA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pershing%22%20%22medal%20of%20honor%22%20%22jolo%22&amp;f=false |location=New York, NY |publisher=Doubleday, Page &amp; Company |page=103 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151121024253/https://books.google.com/books?id=6uRAAQAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA103&amp;dq=%22pershing%22+%22medal+of+honor%22+%22jolo%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ei=poM6Ve7rOYLTggTv9oCQCA&amp;ved=0CC8Q6AEwAw#v=onepage&amp;q=%22pershing%22%20%22medal%20of%20honor%22%20%22jolo%22&amp;f=false |archivedate=November 21, 2015 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1922 a further review of this event resulted in Pershing being recommended for the [[Distinguished Service Cross (United States)|Distinguished Service Cross]], but as the [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] Pershing disapproved the action.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Smythe |first=Donald |date=1973 |title=Guerrilla Warrior: The Early Life of John J.

On December 20, 1913, Pershing received orders to take command of the 8th Brigade at the [[Presidio of San Francisco|Presidio]] in [[San Francisco]]. With tensions running high on the border between the United States and Mexico, the brigade was deployed to [[Fort Bliss, Texas]] on April 24, 1914, arriving there on the 27th.&lt;ref&gt;Vandiver, Volume I, p. 582&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death of wife and children===
After a year at Fort Bliss, Pershing decided to take his family there. The arrangements were almost complete, when on the morning of August 27, 1915, he received a telegram informing him of a fire in the [[Presidio of San Francisco|Presidio]] in [[San Francisco]], where a lacquered floor caught fire and the flames rapidly spread, resulting in the smoke inhalation deaths of his wife, Helen Frances Warren, and three young daughters, Mary, age 3, Anne, age 7, and Helen, age 8.

==World War I==
[[File:John Pershing, Bain bw photo as major general, 1917.jpg|thumb|right|175px|left|Major General Pershing of the [[National Army (USA)|National Army]]]]

At the start of the United States' involvement in [[World War I]] President [[Woodrow Wilson]] considered mobilizing an army to join the fight. [[Frederick Funston]], Pershing's superior in Mexico, was being considered for the top billet as the Commander of the American Expeditionary Force (AEF) when he died suddenly from a heart attack on February 19, 1917. Pershing was the most likely candidate other than Funston, and following America's entrance into the war in May, Wilson briefly interviewed Pershing, and then selected him for the command.  He was officially installed in the position on May 10, 1917, and held the post until 1918. On October 6, 1917, Pershing, then a [[Major general (United States)|major general]], was promoted to full general in the [[National Army (USA)|National Army]].  He bypassed the three star rank of lieutenant general, and was the first full general since [[Philip Sheridan]] in 1888.  As AEF commander, Pershing was responsible for the organization, training, and supply of a combined professional and draft Army and National Guard force that eventually grew from 27,000 inexperienced men to two Armies, with a third forming as the war ended, totaling over two million soldiers.

Pershing exercised significant control over his command, with a full delegation of authority from Wilson and [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Newton D. Baker]]. Baker, cognizant of the endless problems of domestic and allied political involvement in military decision making in wartime, gave Pershing unmatched authority to run his command as he saw fit. In turn, Pershing exercised his prerogative carefully, not engaging in politics or disputes over government policy that might distract him from his military mission. While earlier a champion of the African-American soldier, he did not advocate their full participation on the battlefield, understanding the general racial attitudes of white Americans. In addition, Wilson held reactionary views on race and owed political debts to southern Democratic politicians.

[[George Marshall]] served as one of Pershing's top assistants during and after the war. Pershing's initial chief of staff was [[James Harbord]], who later took a combat command but worked as Pershing's closest assistant for many years and remained extremely loyal to him.

[[File:Pershing at Lafayette Tomb.jpg|left|thumb|282px|Pershing saluting the [[Gilbert du Motier, marquis de Lafayette|Marquis de Lafayette]]'s grave in [[Paris]]]]

After departing from [[Fort Jay]] at [[Governors Island]] in New York Harbor under top secrecy in May 1917, Pershing arrived in France in June 1917. In a show of American presence, part of the [[16th Infantry Regiment (United States)#World War I|16th Infantry Regiment]] marched through Paris shortly after his arrival. Pausing at the tomb of [[Gilbert du Motier, Marquis de Lafayette]], he was reputed to have uttered the famous line "Lafayette, we are here," a line spoken, in fact, by his aide, Colonel [[Charles E. Stanton]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_16/edit16_print.html|title=Mattox: Natural Allies|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070330165559/http://www.unc.edu/depts/diplomat/AD_Issues/amdipl_16/edit16_print.html|archivedate=March 30, 2007|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; American forces were deployed in France in the autumn of 1917.

In September 1917 the French government commissioned a portrait of Pershing by 23-year-old Romanian artist Micheline Resco.  Pershing removed the stars and flag from his car and sat up front with his chauffeur while traveling from his AEF headquarters to visit her by night in her apartment on the rue Descombes.  Their friendship continued for the rest of his life.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |last=Fleming |first=Thomas |year=1995 |title=Iron General |journal=[[MHQ: The Quarterly Journal of Military History]] |volume=7 |issue=2 |pages=66, 73 |publisher=American Historical Publications }}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1946, at 85, Pershing secretly wed French-Romanian portrait artist Micheline Resco in his Walter Reed Hospital apartment. Resco was 35 years his junior&lt;ref name="news.unl.edu"/&gt;

===Battle of Hamel===
For the first time in American history, Pershing allowed American soldiers to be under the command of a foreign power. In late June, General [[Henry Rawlinson, 1st Baron Rawlinson|Rawlinson]], commanding the British Fourth Army, suggested to Australian Lieutenant General [[John Monash]] that American involvement in a set-piece attack alongside the experienced Australians in the upcoming [[Battle of Hamel]] would both give the American troops experience and also strengthen the Australian battalions by an additional company each. On June 29, General Bell, commanding the American 33rd Division, selected two companies each from the 131st and 132nd Infantry regiments of the 66th brigade. Monash had been promised ten companies of American troops and on June 30 the remaining companies of the 1st and 2nd battalions of the 131st regiment were sent. Each American platoon was attached to an Australian company, but there was difficulty in integrating the American platoons (which numbered 60 men) among the Australian companies of 100 men. This difficulty was overcome by reducing the size of each American platoon by one-fifth and sending the troops thus removed, which numbered 50 officers and men, back to battalion reinforcement camps.

The day before the attack was scheduled to commence, Pershing learnt of the plan and ordered the withdrawal of six American companies.&lt;ref name="Nunan, Peter 2000"&gt;Nunan, Peter (2000). "Diggers' Fourth of July". ''Military History''. 17 (3): 26–32 &amp; 80. {{ISSN|0889-7328}}&lt;/ref&gt; While a few Americans, such as those attached to the 42nd Battalion, disobeyed the order, the majority, although disappointed, moved back to the rear. This meant that battalions had to rearrange their attack formations and caused a serious reduction in the size of the Allied force. For example, the 11th Brigade was now attacking with 2,200 men instead of 3,000.&lt;ref&gt;Bean, C.E.W (1942). The Australian Imperial Force in France during the Allied Offensive, 1918.

===African-American units===
Under [[civilian control of the military]], Pershing adhered to the racial policies of [[President of the United States|President]] [[Woodrow Wilson]], [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Newton D. Baker]], and southern Democrats who promoted the "[[separate but equal]]" doctrine. African-American "[[Buffalo Soldier]]s" units were not allowed to participate with the [[American Expeditionary Forces|American Expeditionary Force (AEF)]] during [[World War I]], but experienced [[non-commissioned officer]]s were provided to other segregated black units for combat service—such as the 317th Engineer Battalion.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/eng/0317enbn.htm |title=Lineage and Honors Information, 317th Engineer Battalion |website=history.army.mil/ |publisher=US Army Center of Military History |access-date=October 2, 2016 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20161111203615/http://www.history.army.mil/html/forcestruc/lineages/branches/eng/0317enbn.htm |archivedate=November 11, 2016 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; The American Buffalo Soldiers of the [[92nd Infantry Division (United States)|92nd]] and [[93rd Infantry Division (United States)|93rd Infantry Divisions]] were the first American soldiers to fight in France in 1918, but they did so under French command as Pershing had detached them from the AEF.

==World War I: 1918 and full American participation==
[[File:John Pershing.jpg|thumb|175px|right|Pershing at General Headquarters in [[Chaumont (Haute-Marne)|Chaumont]], France, October 1918.]]

In early 1918, entire divisions were beginning to serve on the front lines alongside French troops. Pershing insisted that the AEF fight as units under American command rather than being split up by battalions to augment British and French regiments and brigades (although the [[27th Infantry Division (United States)|27th]] and [[30th Infantry Division (United States)|30th Divisions]], grouped under [[II Corps (United States)|II Corps]] command, were loaned during the [[Spring Offensive|desperate days of spring 1918]], fought with the British/Australian/Canadian [[Fourth Army (United Kingdom)|Fourth Army]] until the end of the war, taking part in the breach of the [[Hindenburg Line]] in October).

In October 1918, Pershing saw the need for a dedicated [[Military Police Corps (United States)|Military Police Corps]] and the first U.S. Army MP School was established at Autun, France. For this, he is considered the founding father of the United States MPs.&lt;ref&gt;Wright, Robert K. Jr. (ed.) ''[http://www.history.army.mil/books/Lineage/mp/mp.htm Army Lineage Series:Military Police] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20111117192807/http://www.history.army.mil/books/Lineage/mp/mp.htm |date=November 17, 2011 }}''&lt;/ref&gt;

Because of the effects of [[trench warfare]] on soldiers' feet, in January 1918, Pershing oversaw the creation of an improved [[combat boot]], the "[[Trench boot|1918 Trench Boot]]," which became known as the "Pershing Boot" upon its introduction.&lt;ref name=lt&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.worldwar1.com/dbc/l_tanks.htm|title=The American Field Shoe|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090815103701/http://www.worldwar1.com/dbc/l_tanks.htm|archivedate=August 15, 2009|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

American forces first saw serious action during the summer of 1918, contributing eight large divisions, alongside 24 French ones, at the [[Second Battle of the Marne]]. Along with the British Fourth Army's victory at [[Battle of Amiens (1918)|Amiens]], the Allied victory at the Second Battle of the Marne marked the turning point of World War I on the [[Western Front (World War I)|Western Front]].

In August 1918 the [[First United States Army|U.S. First Army]] had been formed, first under Pershing's direct command and then by Lieutenant General [[Hunter Liggett]], when the [[Second United States Army|U.S. Second Army]] under Lieutenant General [[Robert Lee Bullard|Robert Bullard]] was created. After a quick victory at [[Battle of Saint-Mihiel|Saint-Mihiel]], east of [[Verdun]], some of the more bullish AEF commanders had hoped to push on eastwards to [[Metz]], but this did not fit in with the plans of the Allied Supreme Commander, [[Ferdinand Foch|Marshal Foch]], for three simultaneous offensives into the "bulge" of the Western Front (the other two being the Fourth Army's breach of the Hindenburg Line and an Anglo-Belgian offensive, led by [[Herbert Plumer, 1st Viscount Plumer|Plumer's]] Second Army, in Flanders). Instead, the AEF was required to redeploy and, aided by French tanks, launched a major offensive northwards in very difficult terrain at [[Meuse-Argonne Offensive|Meuse-Argonne]]. Initially enjoying numerical odds of eight to one, this offensive eventually engaged 35 or 40 of the 190 or so German divisions on the Western Front, although to put this in perspective, around half the German divisions were engaged on the [[British Expeditionary Force (World War I)|British Expeditionary Force]] (BEF) sector at the time.

[[File:Stars and Stripes first issue.tif|thumb|left|Pershing on the front page of the first issue of ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]'', February 8, 1918.]]

The offensive was marked by a Pershing failure, specifically his reliance on massed infantry attacks with little artillery support led to high casualty rates in the capturing of three key points. This was despite the AEF facing only second-line German troops after the decision by [[Erich Ludendorff]], the [[German General Staff|German Chief of Staff]], to withdraw to the Hindenburg Line on October 3–and in notable contrast to the simultaneous British breakthrough of the Hindenburg Line in the north. Pershing was subsequently forced to reorganize the AEF with the creation of the Second Army, and to step down as the commander of the First Army.&lt;ref&gt;Trask, David F. ''The AEF and Coalition Warmaking, 1917–1918''. University Press of Kansas, 1993, p. 141.&lt;/ref&gt;

When he arrived in Europe, Pershing had openly scorned the slow trench warfare of the previous three years on the Western Front, believing that American soldiers' skill with the rifle would enable them to avoid costly and senseless fighting over a small area of [[no-man's land]]. This was regarded as unrealistic by British and French commanders, and (privately) by a number of Americans such as [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army|Army Chief of Staff]] General [[Tasker H. Bliss|Tasker Bliss]] and even Liggett. Even German generals were negative, with Ludendorff dismissing Pershing's strategic efforts in the Meuse-Argonne offensive by recalling how "the attacks of the youthful American troops broke down with the heaviest losses".&lt;ref&gt;Trask, David F. ''The AEF and Coalition Warmaking, 1917–1918''. University Press of Kansas, 1993, p. 142.&lt;/ref&gt; The AEF had performed well in the relatively open warfare of the Second Battle of the Marne, but the eventual American casualties against German defensive positions in the Argonne (roughly 120,000 American casualties in six weeks, against 35 or 40 German divisions) were not noticeably better than those of the Franco-British [[Battle of the Somme|offensive on the Somme]] two years earlier (600,000 casualties in four and a half months, versus 50 or so German divisions). More ground was gained, but by this stage of the war the [[German Army (German Empire)|German Army]] was in worse shape than in previous years.

Some writers&lt;ref&gt;e.g., David F. Trask (1993)&lt;/ref&gt; have speculated that Pershing's frustration at the slow progress through the Argonne was the cause of two incidents which then ensued. First, he ordered the U.S. First Army to take "the honor" of recapturing [[Sedan, France|Sedan]], site of the [[Battle of Sedan|French defeat in 1870]]; the ensuing confusion (an order was issued that "boundaries were not to be considered binding") exposed American troops to danger not only from the French on their left, but even from one another, as the [[1st Infantry Division (United States)|1st Division]] tacked westward by night across the path of the [[42nd Infantry Division (United States)|42nd Division]] (accounts differ as to whether [[Brigadier general (United States)|Brigadier General]] [[Douglas MacArthur]], then commanding the 84th Brigade of the 42nd Division, was really mistaken for a German officer and arrested). Liggett, who had been away from headquarters the previous day, had to sort out the mess and implement the instructions from the Allied Supreme Command, Marshal Foch, allowing the French to recapture the city; he later recorded that this was the only time during the war in which he lost his temper.

Second, Pershing sent an unsolicited letter to the Allied [[Supreme War Council]], demanding that the Germans not be given an armistice and that instead, the Allies should push on and obtain an unconditional surrender.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|title=Pershing and the Armistice|author=Lowry, Bullitt|journal=[[The Journal of American History]]|volume=55|number=2|date=September 1968|page=281|url=https://www.jstor.org/pss/1899558}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although in later years, many, including President [[Franklin D. Roosevelt]], felt that Pershing had been correct, at the time, this was a breach of political authority. Pershing narrowly escaped a serious reprimand from Wilson's aide, [[Edward M. House|"Colonel" Edward M. House]], and later apologized.{{Citation needed|date=January 2009}}

[[File:Gen Pershing decorating soldiers in Trier c1919.jpg|thumb|right|General Pershing decorating soldiers in Trier, 1919.]]

At the time of the [[Armistice of 11 November 1918|Armistice]], another Franco-American offensive was due to start on November 14, thrusting towards [[Metz]] and into [[Lorraine]], to take place simultaneously with further BEF advances through [[Belgium]].

In his memoirs, Pershing claimed that the American breakout from the Argonne at the start of November was the decisive event leading to the [[Germany|German]] acceptance of an armistice, because it made untenable the Antwerp–Meuse line. This is probably an exaggeration; the outbreak of civil unrest and naval mutiny in Germany, the collapse of [[Kingdom of Bulgaria|Bulgaria]], the [[Ottoman Empire]], and particularly [[Austria-Hungary]] following [[Allies of World War I|Allied]] victories in [[Thessaloniki|Salonika]], Syria, and Italy, and the Allied victories on the Western Front were among a series of events in the autumn of 1918 which made it clear that Allied victory was inevitable, and diplomatic inquiries about an armistice had been going on throughout October. President Wilson was keen to tie matters up before the mid-term elections,{{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} and as the other Allies were running low on supplies and manpower,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Peare |first=Catherine Owens |date=1963 |title=The Woodrow Wilson Story: An Idealist in Politics |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=q9UEAQAAIAAJ&amp;q=%22the+war+in+Europe+at+the+time+that+the+United+States+became+an+associate+of+the+Allies+was+still+at+a+stalemate.+The+Allied+countries+were+reaching+the+exhaustion+of+both+men+and+supplies%22&amp;dq=%22the+war+in+Europe+at+the+time+that+the+United+States+became+an+associate+of+the+Allies+was+still+at+a+stalemate.+The+Allied+countries+were+reaching+the+exhaustion+of+both+men+and+supplies%22&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwj3k6aTw8jJAhXCPD4KHc2VAjMQ6AEIHDAA |location=New York, NY |publisher=Thomas Y.

American successes were largely credited to Pershing, and he became the most celebrated American leader of the war. Critics, {{Who|date=June 2009}} however, claimed that Pershing commanded from far behind the lines and was critical of commanders who personally led troops into battle. {{Citation needed|date=June 2009}} MacArthur saw Pershing as a desk soldier, and the relationship between the two men deteriorated by the end of the war. Similar criticism of senior commanders by the younger generation of officers (the future generals of [[World War II]]) was made in the British and other armies, but in fairness to Pershing, although it was not uncommon for brigade commanders to serve near the front and even be killed, the state of communications in World War I made it more practical for senior generals to command from the rear. He controversially ordered his troops to continue fighting after the armistice was signed. This resulted in 3,500 American casualties on the last day of the war, an act which was regarded as murder by several officers under his command.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historynet.com/world-war-i-wasted-lives-on-armistice-day.htm|title=World War I: Wasted Lives on Armistice Day|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110515085844/http://www.historynet.com/world-war-i-wasted-lives-on-armistice-day.htm|archivedate=May 15, 2011|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The year of 1918 also saw a personal health struggle for Pershing as he was sickened during the [[1918 flu pandemic]], but unlike many who were not so fortunate, Pershing survived.&lt;ref&gt;Collier, Richard.

Both organizations still exist today and welcome new officer members to their ranks.  Pershing himself would join the MOFW in 1924.

There was a movement to draft Pershing as a candidate for president in 1920; he refused to campaign, but indicated that he "wouldn't decline to serve" if the people wanted him.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Yockelson |first=Mitchell |date=2016 |title=Forty-Seven Days: How Pershing's Warriors Came of Age to Defeat the German Army in World War I |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=cRbZCwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA324 |location=New York, NY |publisher=NAL Caliber |page=324 |isbn=978-0-451-46695-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though Pershing was a Republican, many of his party's leaders considered him too closely tied to the policies of the [[United States Democratic Party|Democratic Party's]] President Wilson.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Fleming |first=Thomas |date=2003 |title=The Illusion Of Victory: America In World War I |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=a6OTYMWr8S4C&amp;pg=RA1-PA51 |location=New York, NY |publisher=Basic Books |page=451 |isbn=978-0-465-02467-4}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another general, [[Leonard Wood]], was the early [[1920 Republican National Convention|Republican front runner]], but the nomination went to Senator [[Warren G.

In 1921, Pershing became [[Chief of Staff of the United States Army]], serving for three years. He created the [[Pershing Map]], a proposed national network of military and civilian highways. The [[Interstate Highway System]] instituted in 1956 bears considerable resemblance to the Pershing map. On his 64th birthday, September 13, 1924, Pershing retired from active military service.  (Army regulations from the late 1860s to the early 1940s required officers to retire on their 64th birthday.)

On November 1, 1921, Pershing was in [[Kansas City, Missouri|Kansas City]] to take part in the groundbreaking ceremony for the Liberty Memorial that was being constructed there, (now known as the [[National World War I Museum and Memorial]]). Also present that day were Lieutenant General [[Jules Marie Alphonse Jacques de Dixmude|Baron Jacques]] of Belgium, Admiral of the Fleet [[David Beatty, 1st Earl Beatty|David Beatty]] of Great Britain, Marshal [[Ferdinand Foch]] of France, and General [[Armando Diaz]] of Italy. One of the main speakers was Vice President [[Calvin Coolidge]]. In 1935, bas-reliefs of Pershing, Jacques, Foch and Diaz by sculptor [[Walker Hancock]] were added to the memorial.  Pershing also laid the cornerstone of the [[Indiana War Memorial#The War Memorial|World War Memorial]] in Indianapolis on July 4, 1927.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Price|first=Nelson|title=Indianapolis Then &amp; Now|publisher=Thunder Bay Press|location=San Diego, California|year=2004|pages=102–03|isbn=1-59223-208-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On October 2, 1922, amid several hundred officers, many of them combat veterans of World War I, Pershing formally established the [[Reserve Officers Association]] (ROA) as an organization at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C. ROA is a 75,000-member, professional association of officers, former officers, and spouses of all the uniformed services of the United States, primarily the Reserve and United States National Guard. It is a congressionally chartered Association that advises the Congress and the President on issues of national security on behalf of all members of the Reserve Component.

In 1924 Pershing became a member of the Pennsylvania Society of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]].  He was also an honorary member of the [[Society of the Cincinnati]] and a Veteran Companion of the [[Military Order of Foreign Wars]].

[[File:John Pershing Newsreel 1940.ogv|thumb|left|1940 newsreel]]

Pershing served on a committee of the [[Sons of the American Revolution]] to establish and recognize [[Constitution Day (United States)|Constitution Day]] in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |editor=Williams, Winston C. |title=Centennial History of the National Society of the Sons of the American Revolution 1889–1989 |publisher=Turner Publishing Company |location=Paducah, Kentucky |page=9 |year=1991 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=0SHHzcZnVwEC |accessdate=January 15, 2011 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131231132048/http://books.google.com/books?id=0SHHzcZnVwEC |archivedate=December 31, 2013 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1930s, Pershing largely retreated to private life, but returned to the public eye with publication of his memoirs, ''[[My Experiences in the World War]]'', which were awarded the 1932 [[Pulitzer Prize]] for history. He was also an active [[Civitan International|Civitan]] during this time.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last= Leonhart |first= James Chancellor |title= The Fabulous Octogenarian |year= 1962 |publisher= Redwood House, Inc. |location= Baltimore Maryland |page= 277 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1940, before and after the [[Fall of France]], Pershing was an outspoken advocate of aid for the [[United Kingdom]] during [[World War II]]. In August 1940, he publicly supported the "[[Destroyers for Bases Agreement]]", whereby the United States sold fifty warships from World War I to the UK in exchange for lengthy leases of land on British possessions for the establishment for military bases.

In 1944, with Congress' creation of the five star rank of General of the Army, Pershing was still considered to be the highest-ranking officer of the United States military as his rank was General of the Armies. "In [1799] Congress created for [[George Washington]] the rank of General of the Armies ... General [[Ulysses S. Grant|[Ulysses S.] Grant]] received the title of General of the Army in 1866 . ... Carefully Congress wrote a bill (HR 7594) to revive the rank of General of the Armies for General Pershing alone to hold during his lifetime.  The rank would cease to exist upon Pershing's death." Later, when asked if this made Pershing a five-star general, [[United States Secretary of War|Secretary of War]] [[Henry L. Stimson]] commented that it did not, since Pershing never wore more than four stars, but that Pershing was still to be considered senior to the present five-star generals of World War II.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Cray |first=Ed |date=1990 |title=General of the Army: George C.

In July 1944, Pershing was visited by [[Free French]] leader General [[Charles de Gaulle]]. When Pershing asked after the health of his old friend, Marshal [[Philippe Pétain]] – who had headed the pro-German [[Vichy France|Vichy]] regime until it was dissolved in late 1942 – de Gaulle replied tactfully that, when he last saw him, the Marshal was well.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Roy Jenkins |first=Roy |last=Jenkins |title=Churchill: A Biography |publisher=Farrar, Straus &amp; Giroux |year=2001 |page=743 |location=New York |isbn=978-0-374-12354-3 |oclc=47658851}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{clear left}}

==Death==
[[File:Pershing's Tombstone.jpg|thumb|200px|Pershing's tombstone at [[Arlington National Cemetery]]]]

On July 15, 1948, Pershing died of [[coronary artery disease]] and [[congestive heart failure]] at [[Walter Reed Army Medical Center|Walter Reed General Hospital]] in Washington, D.C., which was his home after 1944. He [[lying in state#United States|lay in state]] at the [[United States Capitol rotunda]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.aoc.gov/nations-stage/lying-state-honor |title= "Lying in State or in Honor" |publisher=US Architect of the Capitol (AOC) |accessdate=2018-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; and following a [[state funeral]], he was buried in [[Arlington National Cemetery]],&lt;ref&gt;{{Find a Grave|806|John Joseph "Black Jack" Pershing}}&lt;/ref&gt; near the grave sites of the soldiers he commanded in Europe.

==Family==
It was during his initial assignment in the American West that Pershing's mother died.&lt;ref name="ParentsDoD"&gt;Vandiver, v.1&lt;/ref&gt; On March 16, 1906, his father died.&lt;ref name="ParentsDoD"/&gt;

Colonel Francis Warren Pershing (1909–1980), John J. Pershing's son, served in the [[Second World War]] as an advisor to the Army Chief of Staff, General [[George C. Marshall]]. After the war he continued with his financial career and founded a stock brokerage firm, [[Pershing LLC|Pershing &amp; Company]]. He was father to two sons, Richard W. Pershing (1942–1968) and John Warren Pershing III (1941–1999). Richard Pershing  served as a second lieutenant  in the [[502nd Infantry]] and was killed in action on February 17, 1968, in [[Vietnam War|Vietnam]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.arlingtoncemetery.net/richardw.htm|title=Arlington Cemetery records: Richard Warren Pershing|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060616173158/http://arlingtoncemetery.net/richardw.htm|archivedate=June 16, 2006|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; John Pershing III served as a special assistant to former Army Chief of Staff General [[Gordon R.

In 1932, eight years after Pershing's retirement from active service, his silver citation star was upgraded to the [[Silver Star]] decoration. In 1941, he was retroactively awarded the [[Army of Occupation of Germany Medal]] for service in Germany following the close of World War I.  As the medal had a profile of Pershing on its obverse, Pershing became the only soldier in the history of the U.S. Army, and only one of four in the entire U.S. Armed Forces, eligible to wear a medal with his own likeness on it. Navy admirals [[George Dewey]], [[William T. Sampson]] and [[Richard E. Byrd]] were also entitled to wear medals with their own image on them.

'''Juan R. Cruz''', Ph.D., (born: January 5, 1946) is a Puerto Rican [[aerospace engineering|aerospace engineer]] who played an instrumental role in the design and development of the [[Mars Exploration Rover]] (MER) and [[Mars Science Laboratory]] (MSL) [[parachute]].&lt;ref name="Lineberry-1"&gt;Denise Lineberry, [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/researchernews/rn_LangleyMSL.html Langley is 'All Systems Go' to Make History on Mars], NASA, 07.16.12 (Accessed Nov. 13 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early years==
Cruz was born and raised in [[Puerto Rico]].  After earning a B.S. (Bachelor of Science) in Aeronautics and Astronautics from the [[Massachusetts Institute of Technology]], he briefly worked at [[Beech Aircraft Corporation]] in [[Wichita, KS]];&lt;ref name="sports"&gt;Joan Ackermann-Blount and William Oscar Johnson,

During his years at MIT he was involved with the Monarch&lt;ref&gt;Geoffrey A. Landis, [http://www.geoffreylandis.com/monarch.htp Human Powered Aircraft - Monarch Crew] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20120202160016/http://www.geoffreylandis.com/monarch.htp |date=2012-02-02 }} (accessed Nov. 13 2012)&lt;/ref&gt;  and [[MIT Daedalus|Daedalus]] [[human powered aircraft]] teams.&lt;ref name="sports" /&gt;&lt;ref name="LaRC"&gt;[http://oeop.larc.nasa.gov/hep/hep-bios.html Hispanics@NASA LaRC Employees' Achievements] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524031122/http://oeop.larc.nasa.gov/hep/hep-bios.html |date=2015-05-24 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Career in NASA==
Cruz is a senior [[aerospace engineer]] in the Exploration Systems Engineering Branch at the NASA [[Langley Research Center]] in [[Hampton, Virginia]]. His responsibilities are focused on research and development of [[atmospheric entry|entry]], descent, and landing (EDL) systems for robotic and human exploration missions. He was a member of the highly successful Mars Exploration Rover (MER) and Mars Science laboratory (MSL) projects that placed rovers on the surface of Mars in 2004 and 2012. His contributions to the MER and MSL projects centered on the design and qualification of the supersonic parachute.&lt;ref name="Lineberry-1" /&gt;&lt;ref name="MIT"&gt;[http://web.mit.edu/museum/about/news/rover.html MIT MUSEUM PRESS RELEASE]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Mars Exploration Rover Mission==
[[File:Rocket assisted descent.jpg|right|200px|thumb|Descent is slowed by parachuete]]
The [[Spirit rover|MER-A rover, ''Spirit'']], was launched on June 10, 2003 at 17:59 [[UTC]], and [[Opportunity rover|MER-B, ''Opportunity'']], on July 7, 2003. ''Spirit'' landed in [[Gusev crater]] on January 4, 2004 and ''Opportunity'' landed in the [[Meridiani Planum]] on the opposite side of Mars from ''Spirit'', on January 25, 2004. Cruz was among the scientists from Langley who helped develop the parachute which helped slow the spacecraft during entry, descent and landing.

According to Cruz: 

&lt;blockquote&gt;There are challenges to testing these parachutes because we can not test it at exactly the right conditions. [[Earth's atmosphere]] is the one we have to work with and the [[Martian atmosphere]] is very different, so you have to make adjustments in how you test the parachute. Another issue is the wind tunnel models we used in our tests were ten-percent scale models, about five feet in diameter.&lt;ref&gt;[http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/news_rels/2003/03-039.pdf NASA News] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070820200750/http://oea.larc.nasa.gov/news_rels/2003/03-039.pdf |date=2007-08-20 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Cruz is also a member of the [[Phoenix (spacecraft)|Phoenix]] (Mars 2007), [[Mars Science Laboratory]] (Mars 2011),&lt;ref&gt;Denise Lineberry, [http://www.nasa.gov/centers/langley/news/researchernews/rn_MSLEDL.html Getting Curiosity to Mars, One Simulation at a Time], NASA, 08.02.12 (Accessed Nov. 13 2012)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Crew Exploration Vehicle]] EDL teams. He has undertaken research on advanced missions to Mars, including robotic airplanes, as well as having been a technical reviewer for the Genesis, Huygens, and Stardust missions. Prior to his involvement with exploration programs he conducted research on high-altitude [[unmanned aircraft]].&lt;ref name="MIT"/&gt;

In 1958, Adams book ''Commonsense Book of Wine'' was published, which sought to bring [[table wine]] into everyday life in the United States. His book ''Wines of America'', published in 1973, is considered the "most thorough work on the subject," specifically regarding the [[California wine]] industry.&lt;ref name="Sullivan1998"&gt;{{cite book|author=Charles Lewis Sullivan|title=A companion to California wine: an encyclopedia of wine and winemaking from the mission period to the present|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=GhJJElLJn5cC|accessdate=24 November 2011|date=1 October 1998|publisher=University of California Press|isbn=978-0-520-21351-7|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life and work==

Leon Adams was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1905. He studied at the [[University of California, Berkeley]], and worked as a journalist for various publications, including [[McClatchy News Service]] and the ''[[San Francisco Bulletin]]''. Adams advocated for farm winery laws which were passed in many states during the 1970s and 1980s. These laws helped grape growers open wineries and sell their wines through wholesale and retail. He founded the Society of Medical Friends of Wine, which brings together doctors for frequent wine tastings.

He worked in California and lived in [[Sausalito, California|Sausalito]]. He died in [[San Francisco]] on September 12, 1995. The ''New York Times'' called him "the seminal wine historian in the United States in the 20th century,".&lt;ref name="Obit1"&gt;{{cite web | author=Howard G.

[[Priam]], the mythical king of [[Troy]] during the [[Trojan War]], supposedly had 18 daughters and 68 sons. Priam had several wives, the primary one [[Hecuba]], daughter of [[Dymas]] or [[Cisseus]], and several concubines, who bore his children. There is no exhaustive list, but many of them are mentioned in various Greek myths. Almost all of Priam's children were slain by the Greeks in the course of the war, or shortly after.

The three main sources for the names of the children of Priam are: [[Homer]]'s ''[[Iliad]]'', where a number of his sons are briefly mentioned among the defenders of [[Troy]]; and two lists in the ''[[Bibliotheca (Pseudo-Apollodorus)|Bibliotheca]]'' and [[Hyginus]]' ''Fabulae''. [[Virgil]] also mentions some of Priam's sons and daughters in the ''[[Aeneid]].'' Some of the daughters taken captive at the end of the war are mentioned by [[Pausanias (geographer)|Pausanias]], who in his turn refers to paintings by [[Polygnotus]] in the [[Lesche]] of [[Delphi]].

These are summarized by author below.

Pausanias enlists several more Trojan captive women, who may or may not be daughters of Priam: Clymene, [[Xenodice (mythology)|Xenodice]], Deinome, Metioche, Peisis, Cleodice. He remarks, however, that of these only Clymene and Deinome were mentioned in literary sources known to him, and that the rest of the names could have been invented by Polygnotus.

==Notes==
*[[Aeneas]] - who later led the survivors of Troy - was not a son of Priam, but his father Anchises was Priam's first cousin, making Aeneas Priam's first cousin once removed.  Aeneas did, however, marry Priam's daughter Creusa, making him a son-in-law of Priam.  [[Ascanius]], the son of Aeneas and Creusa, was himself the ancestor of [[Romulus]] and [[Remus]].
* According to Homer:
** Lycaon is the son of [[Laothoe]].
** Gorgythion is the son of Castianeira.
* According to Apollodorus: 
**Aesacus's mother is [[Arisbe (daughter of Merops)|Arisbe]], daughter of Merops.
**[[Hecuba]], daughter of Dymas is the mother of Hector, Paris, Deiphobus, Helenus, Pammon, Polites, Antiphus, Hipponous, Polydorus, Troilus (Troilus may be the son of Apollo), Laodice, Polyxena, Cassandra and Creusa.
*In [[Mozart]]'s opera, [[Idomeneo]], Ilia is mentioned as another daughter of Priam.

Madikeri was formerly known as ''Muddu raja keri''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://coorg.com/history.html Coorg History] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090426080651/http://www.coorg.com/history.html |date=2009-04-26 }}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Muddurajakeri'' which means Mudduraja's town, was named after the prominent [[Haleri]] king Mudduraja who ruled [[Kodagu]] from 1633 to 1687.

== History ==
[[File:Madikeri map.jpg|thumb|Map c. 1854]]
The history of Madikeri is related to the history of [[Kodagu]]. From the 2nd to the 6th century AD, the northern part of [[Kodagu]] was ruled by [[Kadamba Dynasty|Kadamba]]s. The southern part of [[Kodagu]] was ruled by [[Gangas]] from the 4th to the 11th century. After defeating the Gangas in the 11th century, [[Chola]]s became the rulers of [[Kodagu]]. In the 12th century, the [[Chola]]s lost Kodagu to the [[Hoysala]]s. [[Kodagu]] fell to the [[Vijayanagara Empire|Vijayanagar]] kings in the 14th century. After their fall, the local chieftains like Karnambahu (''Palegars'') started ruling their areas directly. They were defeated by Haleri Dynasty founder Veeraraju, (Nephew of Ikkeri Sadashiva Nayaka who were descendants of Talakadu Ganga Dynasty),. In the year 1700AD Ikkeri Somashekara Nayaka gifted Puttur and Amara Sullia Magnes of Tulunadu to Haleri Kings. Descendants of Veeraraju who are known as "[[Kodagu Kingdom|Haleri Dynasty]]" ruled [[Kodagu]] from 1600-1834 AD. Haleri king Mudduraja built the Fort in Madikeri and made it&lt;ref name="Tulu Gowdas"&gt;{{cite book|author=Puttur Anantharaja Gowda|title="IN PURSUIT OF OUR ROOTS"|year=2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; as their capital. Mudduraja, the third Haleri king started leveling the land around Madikeri and built a fort in the year 1681. [[Madikeri Fort]] which was original built of mud and was replaced by [[Tipu Sultan]]. [[Kodagu]] became the part of [[British India]] after 1834 AD.&lt;ref&gt;Jerry Dupont, ''[https://books.google.com/books?id=pCX660FA5wMC&amp;pg=PA592&amp;dq=kodagu+history+British+1834&amp;as_brr=3&amp;sig=ACfU3U0zZfKPq3Ozx2PKNYMSmrZ3I6RztA The Common Law Abroad]'', Wm.

== Transportation ==
[[File:Raja seat madikeri.JPG|right|thumb|Raja's Seat park and viewpoint]]

=== By road ===
Madikeri lies on the [[National Highway 275 (India)|National Highway 275]] that runs from [[Mangaluru]] to [[Bengaluru]], via Mysuru within Karnataka. It is 120&amp;nbsp;km from [[Mysore|Mysuru]] and 136&amp;nbsp;km from [[Mangaluru]]. From [[Bengaluru]], the state capital of [[Karnataka]], one can take the State Highway 17 ([[Bangalore|Bengaluru]] - [[Mysore|Mysuru]] Highway) and take a deviation just after the town of [[Srirangapatna]] to join National Highway 275 towards Madikeri. It can be approached from [[Mangaluru]] via [[Puttur, Karnataka|Puttur]], [[Sullia]] passing through [[Sampaje|Sampaje Ghat]]. From [[Bangalore|Bengaluru]], Madikeri is at a distance of 252&amp;nbsp;km. Nearby towns are [[Hassan, India|Hassan]] (103&amp;nbsp;km), [[Sullia]] at a distance of 52&amp;nbsp;km in [[Karnataka]] state and [[Kasaragod]], [[Kannur]], [[Thalassery]], [[Kanhangad]] and [[Uppala]] in [[Kerala]] state (each around 114&amp;nbsp;km away).

=== By rail ===
Madikeri does not have a railway station. The nearest railheads are [[Hassan, Karnataka|Hassan]], [[Kasaragod Town|Kasaragod]], [[Kanhangad]], [[Kannur]] and [[Thalassery]] (each of which are almost equidistant at 115&amp;nbsp;km away). [[Mysore|Mysuru]] at 120&amp;nbsp;km and [[Mangalore|Mangaluru]] at 136&amp;nbsp;km away are good alternatives to reach Madikeri from within Karnataka.

'''María Lugones''' is an [[Argentina|Argentine]] [[feminist philosophy|feminist philosopher]], [[social criticism|social critic]], and Associate Professor of Comparative Literature and Philosophy, Interpretation and Culture, and of Philosophy, and of [[women's studies|Women's Studies]] at [[Binghamton University]] in [[New York state|New York]]. She developed the idea of [[coloniality of gender]], a [[gender binary]] or heterosexual system in which there are different hierarchies of power and [[homosexuality]] or [[transgender]] identities are not recognized.

==Early life==

===Biography===
Lugones was born in the [[pampas]] of Argentina. Her father was the son of a [[sharecropper]] and her mother was the daughter of [[Catalonia|Catalan]] [[immigrant]]s. Her father’s parents had been sharecroppers in a province of [[Buenos Aires]], [[Los Toldos]]. Both sets of families had been extremely poor and often struggled to make ends meet.

===Education===
She received her Bachelor of Arts in the field of Philosophy from the [[University of California, Los Angeles]] with ''magna cum laude''. In 1973 she received her Master of Arts in the department of Philosophy from the [[University of Wisconsin, Madison]]. Shortly after that, in 1978, she received her Doctor of Philosophy from the department of Philosophy with a minor from the department of political science after finishing her dissertation on Morality and Public Relations from the University of Wisconsin, Madison.

==Education==
Green received a B.S. from [[Oberlin College]] (Computer Science), a B.M. from [[Oberlin College]] (Electronic Music), a Masters from [[Johns Hopkins University]] (Computer Science), and a PhD from [[Johns Hopkins University]] (Computer Science). His dissertation was titled Cryptography for Secure and Private Databases: Enabling Practical Data Access without Compromising Privacy.

==Blog==
Green is the author of the blog, "A Few Thoughts on Cryptographic Engineering". In September 2013, a blog post by Green summarizing and speculating on [[National Security Agency|NSA]]'s programs to weaken cryptography, titled "On the NSA", was controversially taken down by Green's academic dean at Johns Hopkins for "contain[ing] a link or links to classified material and also [using] the NSA logo".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nate Anderson |url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2013/09/crypto-prof-asked-to-remove-nsa-related-blog-post/ |title=Crypto prof asked to remove NSA-related blog post |publisher=Ars Technica |date=2013-09-09 |accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; As [[Ars Technica]] notes, this was "a strange request on its face", as this use of the NSA logo by Green was not "reasonably calculated to convey the impression that such use is approved, endorsed, or authorized by the National Security Agency", and linking classified information published by news organizations is legally entirely uncontroversial. The university later apologized to Green, and the blog post was restored (sans NSA logo), with a Johns Hopkins spokesman saying that "I'm not saying that there was a great deal of legal analysis done" as explanation for the legally unmotivated takedown.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Nate Anderson |url=https://arstechnica.com/security/2013/09/university-apologizes-for-censoring-crypto-prof-over-anti-nsa-post/ |title=University apologizes for censoring crypto prof over anti-NSA post |publisher=Ars Technica |date=2013-09-10 |accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In addition to general blog posts about NSA, encryption, and security, Green's blog entries on NSA's backdoor in [[Dual_EC_DRBG]], and [[RSA Security]]'s usage of the backdoored [[cryptographically secure pseudorandom number generator]] (CSPRNG), have been widely cited in the mainstream news media.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Fink, Erica |url=http://money.cnn.com/video/technology/2013/06/07/t-prism-what-nsa-could-know-about-you.cnnmoney/ |title=Prism: What the NSA could know about you - Video - Technology |website=Money.cnn.com |date=2013-06-07 |accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2013/09/06/us/nsa-foils-much-internet-encryption.html?pagewanted=all|title=.S.A.

==Work==
Green currently holds the position of Associate Professor at the Johns Hopkins Information Security Institute. He teaches courses pertaining to practical cryptography.

Green is part of the group which developed [[Zerocoin]], an anonymous [[cryptocurrency]] protocol.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=http://articles.baltimoresun.com/2014-02-01/news/bs-md-hopkins-bitcoin-20140201_1_virtual-currencies-bitcoin-foundation-ross-william-ulbricht |title=Hopkins researchers are creating an alternative to Bitcoin - tribunedigital-baltimoresun |website=Articles.baltimoresun.com |date=2014-02-01 |accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2014/01/13/bitcoin-anonymity-upgrade-zerocoin-to-become-its-own-cryptocurrency/ |title=Bitcoin Anonymity Upgrade Zerocoin To Become An Independent Cryptocurrency |website=Forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://bits.blogs.nytimes.com/2013/11/18/researchers-work-to-add-more-anonymity-to-bitcoin/|title=Researchers Work to Add More Anonymity to Bitcoin|newspaper=[[The New York Times]]|accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Peck |first=Morgen E. |url=http://spectrum.ieee.org/computing/networks/whos-who-in-bitcoin-zerocoin-hero-matthew-green/ |title=Who’s Who in Bitcoin: Zerocoin Hero Matthew Green - IEEE Spectrum |website=Spectrum.ieee.org |date=2013-10-24 |accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author= |url=https://www.forbes.com/sites/andygreenberg/2013/04/12/zerocoin-add-on-for-bitcoin-could-make-it-truly-anonymous-and-untraceable/ |title='Zerocoin' Add-on For Bitcoin Could Make It Truly Anonymous And Untraceable |website=Forbes.com |date= |accessdate=2016-05-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Zerocoin is a proposed extension to the [[Bitcoin network|Bitcoin protocol]] that would add [[anonymity]] to [[Bitcoin]] transactions. Zerocoin provides anonymity by the introduction of a separate ''zerocoin'' cryptocurrency that is stored in the Bitcoin block chain. Though originally proposed for use with the Bitcoin network, zerocoin could be integrated into any [[cryptocurrency]]. His research team has exposed flaws in more than one third of  [[Transport Layer Security|SSL/TLS]] encrypted web sites as well as vulnerabilities in encryption technologies, including [[RSA BSAFE]], Exxon/Mobil [[Speedpass]], [[E-ZPass]], and automotive security systems. In 2015, Green was a member of the research team that identified the [[Logjam (computer security)|Logjam]] vulnerability in the TLS protocol.

Green started his career in 1999 at [[AT&amp;T Laboratories]] in Florham Park, New Jersey. At AT&amp;T Labs he worked on a variety of projects including audio coding/secure content distribution, streaming video and wireless localization services. As a graduate student he co-founded Independent Security Evaluators (ISE) with two fellow students and Avi Rubin in 2005. Green served as CTO of ISE until his departure in 2011.

Green is a member of the technical advisory board for the Linux Foundation Core Infrastructure Initiative, formed to address critical Internet security concerns in the wake of  the [[Heartbleed]] security bug disclosed in April 2014 in the [[OpenSSL]] cryptography library. He sits on the technical advisory boards for [[CipherCloud]], Overnest and Mozilla Cybersecurity Delphi. Green co-founded and serves on the Board for Directors of the Open Crypto Audit Project (OCAP), which undertook a [[security audit]] of the [[TrueCrypt]] software.&lt;ref name=OCAPPeople&gt;{{cite web|title=Technical Advisory Board|url=http://opencryptoaudit.org/people|work=Open Crypto Audit Project|accessdate=30 May 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=ITCAY&gt;{{cite web|last=White|first=Kenneth|title=Is TrueCrypt Audited Yet?|url=http://istruecryptauditedyet.com/|website=Istruecryptaudiedyet.com|accessdate=30 May 2014|author2=Green, Matthew}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Education and early life==

Max Newman was born Maxwell Herman Alexander Neumann in [[Chelsea, London]], [[England]], to a Jewish family, on 7 February 1897.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; His father was Herman Alexander Neumann, originally from the German city of [[Bydgoszcz|Bromberg]] (now in [[Poland]]) who had emigrated with his family to London at the age of 15.&lt;ref name="n176"&gt;William Newman, "Max Newman – Mathematician, Codebreaker and Computer Pioneer", pp. 176-188 in {{cite book |author= |title=Colossus: The secrets of Bletchley Park's code-breaking computers |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |location= |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=0-19-957814-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Herman worked as a secretary in a company, and married Sarah Ann (Pike), an English schoolteacher, in 1896.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

The family moved to [[Dulwich]] in 1903, and Newman attended Goodrich Road school, then [[City of London School]] from 1908.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Heard2010"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.jcc.org.uk/About-the-JCC/From-the-Archives/Max-Newman-s-Medal.aspx |title=Max Newman's Medal |last=Heard |first=Terry |publisher=John Carpenter Club (City of London School Alumni) |date=2010|accessdate=2016-11-06 |quote=the [John Carpenter Club] archive has recently acquired the Beaufoy Medal for Mathematics awarded to Max Newman in 1915 }}&lt;/ref&gt; At school, he excelled in classics and in mathematics. He played chess and the piano well.&lt;ref name="colossus.newman"&gt;{{cite book |last=Newman |first=William |editor-first=B. Jack |editor-last=Copeland |title=Colossus The Secrets of Bletchley Park's Codebreaking Computers |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2010 |pages=176–188 |chapter=14. Max Newman - Mathematician, Codebreaker, and Computer Pioneer  |  isbn=978-0-19-957814-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Newman won a scholarship to study mathematics at [[St John's College, Cambridge]] in 1915, and in 1916 gained a First in Part I of the [[Cambridge Mathematical Tripos]].&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt;

==World War I==

His studies were interrupted by [[World War I]]. His father was [[internment|interned]] as an enemy alien after the start of the war in 1914, and upon his release he returned to Germany. In 1916, Herman changed his name by [[deed poll]] to the anglicised "Newman" and Sarah did likewise in 1920.&lt;ref name="dpa"&gt;{{Cite journal | last1 = Anderson | first1 = D. | title = Max Newman: Topologist, Codebreaker, and Pioneer of Computing | doi = 10.1109/MAHC.2007.4338447 | journal = IEEE Annals of the History of Computing | volume = 29 | issue = 3 | pages = 76–81 | year = 2007 | pmid =  | pmc = }}&lt;/ref&gt; In January 1917 Newman took up a teaching post at [[Archbishop Holgate's School|Archbishop Holgate's Grammar School]] in [[York]], leaving in April 1918. He spent some months in the [[Royal Army Pay Corps]], and then taught at [[Chigwell School]] for six months in 1919 before returning to Cambridge.&lt;ref name="n176"/&gt; He was called up for [[military service]] in February 1918, but claimed [[conscientious objection]] due to his [[belief]]s and his father's country of origin, and thereby avoided any direct role in the fighting.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Gannon, {{cite book |author= |title=Colossus: The secrets of Bletchley Park's code-breaking computers |publisher=Oxford University Press, USA |location= |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=0-19-957814-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}} pp. 225-226,&lt;/ref&gt;

==Between the wars==

===Graduation===
He resumed his interrupted studies in October 1919, and graduated in 1921 as a [[Wrangler (University of Cambridge)|Wrangler]] (equivalent to a [[British undergraduate degree classification#First-class honours|First]]) in Part II of the Mathematical Tripos, and gained distinction in Schedule B (the equivalent of Part III).&lt;ref name="odnb" /&gt;&lt;ref name="n176" /&gt; His dissertation considered the use of "symbolic machines" in physics, foreshadowing his later interest in computing machines.&lt;ref name="colossus.newman" /&gt;

===Early academic career===
On 5 November 1923 he was elected a [[Research fellow|Fellow]] of St John's.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; He worked on the foundations of [[combinatorial topology]], and proposed that a notion of equivalence be defined using only three elementary "moves".&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; Newman's definition avoided difficulties that had arisen from previous definitions of the concept.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; Publishing over twenty papers established his reputation as an "expert in modern topology".&lt;ref name="colossus.newman" /&gt; Newman wrote ''Elements of the topology of plane sets of points'',&lt;ref name="topology"/&gt; a work on [[general topology]] and undergraduate text.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Smith, P. A.|authorlink=Paul Althaus Smith|title=Review of ''Elements of the Topology of Plane Sets of Points'' by M. H. A. Newman|journal=Bull. Am. Math. Soc.|volume=45|issue=11|year=1939|pages=822–824|url=http://www.ams.org/journals/bull/1939-45-11/S0002-9904-1939-07087-0/S0002-9904-1939-07087-0.pdf}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also published papers on [[mathematical logic]], and solved a special case of [[Hilbert's fifth problem]].&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt;

He was appointed a lecturer in mathematics at Cambridge in 1927,&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; where his 1935 lectures on the Foundations of Mathematics and [[Gödel's incompleteness theorems|Gödel's theorem]] inspired [[Alan Turing]] to embark on his pioneering work on the ''[[Entscheidungsproblem]]'' (decision problem) using a hypothetical [[computer|computing machine]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal| first1 = A.

He realised the paper's importance and helped ensure swift publication.&lt;ref name="colossus.newman" /&gt;  Newman subsequently arranged for Turing to visit [[Princeton University|Princeton]] where [[Alonzo Church]] was working on the same problem but using his [[Lambda calculus]].&lt;ref name="n176"/&gt; During this period, Newman started to share Turing's dream of building a [[Stored-program computer|stored-program computing machine]].&lt;ref name="colossus.rise"&gt;{{cite book |last=Copeland |first=Jack |editor-first=B. Jack |editor-last=Copeland |title=Colossus The Secrets of Bletchley Park's Codebreaking Computers |publisher=Oxford University Press |year=2010 |pages=91–100 |chapter=9. Colossus and the Rise of the Modern Computer |  isbn=978-0-19-957814-6 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During this time at Cambridge, he developed close friendships with [[Patrick Blackett]], [[J. H. C. Whitehead|Henry Whitehead]] and [[Lionel Penrose]].&lt;ref name="colossus.newman" /&gt;

In September 1937, Newman and his family accepted an invitation to work for six months at Princeton. At Princeton, he worked on the [[Poincaré Conjecture]] and, in his final weeks there, presented a proof. However, in July 1938, after he returned to Cambridge, Newman discovered that his proof was fatally flawed.&lt;ref name="colossus.newman" /&gt;

In 1939, Newman was elected a [[Fellow of the Royal Society]].&lt;ref name="colossus.newman" /&gt;

===Family life===
In December 1934 he married [[Lyn Irvine|Lyn Lloyd Irvine]], a writer, with [[Patrick Blackett]] as best man.&lt;ref name="frs"/&gt; They had two sons, Edward (born 1935) and [[William Newman (computer scientist)|William]] (born 1939).&lt;ref name="n176"/&gt;

==World War II==
The United Kingdom declared war on Germany on 3 September 1939. Newman's father was Jewish, which was of particular concern in the face of [[Nazi Germany]], and Lyn, Edward and William were evacuated to America in July 1940 (where they spent three years before returning to England in October 1943). After [[Oswald Veblen]]—maintaining 'that every able-bodied man ought to be carrying a gun or hand-grenade and fight for his country'—opposed moves to bring him to Princeton, Newman remained at Cambridge and at first continued research and lecturing.&lt;ref name="n176"/&gt;

===Government Code and Cypher School===
By spring 1942, he was considering involvement in war work. He made enquiries. After Patrick Blackett recommended him to the Director of Naval Intelligence, Newman was sounded out by [[Frank Adcock]] in connection with the [[Government Communications Headquarters|Government Code and Cypher School]] at [[Bletchley Park]].&lt;ref name="n176"/&gt;

Newman was cautious, concerned to ensure that the work would be sufficiently interesting and useful, and there was also the possibility that his father's German nationality would rule out any involvement in top-secret work.&lt;ref&gt;Gannon, 2006, pp. 227–228&lt;/ref&gt; The potential issues were resolved by the summer, and he agreed to arrive at [[Bletchley Park]] on 31 August 1942. Newman was invited by [[F. L. Lucas|F. L. (Peter) Lucas]] to work on [[Enigma machine|Enigma]] but decided to join [[John Tiltman|Tiltman]]'s group working on [[Tunny (cryptography)|Tunny]].&lt;ref name="n176"/&gt;

===Tunny===
{{Further|Lorenz cipher|Cryptanalysis of the Lorenz cipher}}
He was assigned to the Research Section and set to work on a German [[teleprinter]] [[cipher]] known as "[[Lorenz cipher|Tunny]]". He joined the "[[Testery]]" in October.&lt;ref&gt;Gannon, 2006, p. 228&lt;/ref&gt; Newman enjoyed the company&lt;ref name="colossus.newman" /&gt; but disliked the work and found that it was not suited to his talents.&lt;ref name="odnb"/&gt; He persuaded his superiors that [[Tutte]]'s method could be mechanised, and he was assigned to develop a suitable machine in December 1942. Shortly afterwards, [[Edward Travis]] (then operational head of Bletchley Park) asked Newman to lead research into mechanised codebreaking.&lt;ref name="n176"/&gt;

===The Newmanry===
{{Main|Newmanry}}
When the war ended, Newman was presented with a silver tankard inscribed 'To MHAN from the Newmanry, 1943-45'.&lt;ref name="colossus.newman"/&gt;

====Heath Robinson====
{{Main|Heath Robinson (codebreaking machine)}}
Construction started in January 1943, and the first prototype was delivered in June 1943.&lt;ref&gt;[[Jack Copeland]] with [[Catherine Caughey]], [[Dorothy Du Boisson]], [[Eleanor Ireland]], Ken Myers, and Norman Thurlow, "Mr Newman's Section", p. 157 of pp. 158–175 in {{cite book |author= |title=Colossus: The secrets of Bletchley Park's code-breaking computers |publisher=[[Oxford University Press]] |location= |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=0-19-957814-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was operated in Newman's new section, termed the "[[Newmanry]]", was housed initially in Hut 11 and initially staffed by himself, [[Donald Michie]], two engineers, and 16 [[Women's Royal Naval Service|Wrens]].&lt;ref name="copeland64"&gt;Jack Copeland, "Machine against Machine", pp. 64-77 in B. Jack Copeland, ed., in {{cite book |author= |title=Colossus: The secrets of Bletchley Park's code-breaking computers |publisher=Oxford University Press |location= |year=2010 |pages= |isbn=0-19-957814-1 |oclc= |doi= |accessdate=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Wrens nicknamed the machine the "[[Heath Robinson (codebreaking machine)|Heath Robinson]]", after the [[W. Heath Robinson|cartoonist]] of the same name who drew humorous drawings of absurd mechanical devices.&lt;ref name="copeland64"/&gt;

====Colossus====
{{Main|Colossus computer}}
The Robinson machines were limited in speed and reliability. [[Tommy Flowers]] of the [[Post Office Research Station]], [[Dollis Hill]] had experience of [[Vacuum tube|thermionic valves]] and built an electronic machine, the [[Colossus computer]] which was installed in the Newmanry. This was a great success and ten were in use by the end of the war.

==Later academic career==

===Fielden Chair, Victoria University of Manchester===
In September 1945, Newman was appointed head of the [[School of Mathematics, University of Manchester|Mathematics Department]] and to the [[Fielden Chair of Pure Mathematics]] at the [[Victoria University of Manchester|University of Manchester]].&lt;ref name="colossus.rise"/&gt;&lt;ref name=EssTuring&gt;{{cite book |title=The essential Turing: seminal writings in computing, logic, philosophy ...|page=209|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=x7mMr4twnloC&amp;pg=PA209 |accessdate=2010-01-27 |publisher=Oxford University Press |isbn=978-0-19-825080-7 |author1=Turing, Alan Mathison |author2=Copeland, B. Jack |authorlink2=Jack Copeland |year=2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Computing Machine Laboratory====

{{Rquote|right|
I am ... hoping to embark on a computing machine section here, having got very interested in electronic devices of this kind during the last two or three years ... I am of course in close touch with Turing.
| Newman, letter to von Neumann, 1946&lt;ref name="colossus.rise"/&gt;}}

Newman lost no time in establishing the renowned [[Royal Society]] [[Computing Machine Laboratory]] at the University.&lt;ref name="EssTuring"/&gt; In February 1946, he wrote to [[John von Neumann]], expressing his desire to build a computing machine.&lt;ref name="colossus.rise"/&gt; The [[Royal Society]] approved Newman's grant application in July 1946.&lt;ref name="colossus.rise"/&gt; [[Frederic Calland Williams]] and [[Thomas Kilburn]], experts in electronic circuit design, were recruited from the  [[Telecommunications Research Establishment]].&lt;ref name="colossus.rise"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EssTuring"/&gt; Kilburn and Williams built [[Manchester Baby|Baby]], the world's first [[Stored-program computer|electronic stored-program digital computer]] based on [[Alan Turing]]'s and [[John von Neumann]]'s ideas.&lt;ref name="colossus.rise"/&gt;&lt;ref name="EssTuring"/&gt;

{{Quotation| Now let's be clear before we go any further that neither Tom Kilburn nor I knew the first thing about computers when we arrived at Manchester University... Newman explained the whole business of how a computer works to us.
 | [[Frederic Calland Williams]], co-creator of [[Manchester Baby]]&lt;ref name="colossus.rise"/&gt;}}

After the [[Automatic Computing Engine]] suffered delays and set backs, Turing accepted Newman's offer and joined the Computer Machine Laboratory in May 1948 as Deputy Director (there being no Director). Turing joined Kilburn and Williams to work on Baby's successor, the [[Manchester Mark I]]. Collaboration between the University and [[Ferranti]] later produced the [[Ferranti Mark I]], the first mass-produced computer to go on sale.&lt;ref name="colossus.rise"/&gt;

===Retirement===
Newman retired in 1964 to live in [[Comberton]], near [[Cambridge]]. After Lyn's death in 1973 he married Margaret Penrose, widow of his friend [[Lionel Penrose]].&lt;ref name="colossus.newman" /&gt;

He continued to do research on [[combinatorial topology]] during a period when England was a major centre of activity notably Cambridge under the leadership of [[Erik Christopher Zeeman|Christopher Zeeman]]. Newman made important contributions leading to an invitation to present his work at the 1962 [[International Congress of Mathematicians]] in Stockholm at the age of 65, and proved a [[Generalized Poincaré conjecture]] for topological [[manifolds]] in 1966.

At the age of 85, Newman began to suffer from [[Alzheimer's disease]]. He died in [[Cambridge]] two years later.&lt;ref name="colossus.newman"/&gt;

==Honours==
* [[Royal Society#Fellows|Fellow of the Royal Society]], elected 1939
* Royal Society [[Sylvester Medal]], awarded 1958
* [[London Mathematical Society]], President 1949–1951
* LMS [[De Morgan Medal]], awarded 1962
* D.Sc. [[University of Hull]], awarded 1968

The Newman Building at Manchester was named in his honour. The building housed the pure mathematicians from the [[Victoria University of Manchester]] between moving out of the Mathematics Tower in 2004 and July 2007 when the School of Mathematics moved into its new [[Alan Turing Building]], where a lecture room is named in his honour.

In 1946, Newman declined the offer of an [[Order of the British Empire|OBE]] as he considered the offer derisory.&lt;ref name="copeland64"/&gt; [[Alan Turing]] had been appointed an OBE six months earlier and Newman felt that it was inadequate recognition of Turing's contribution to winning the war, referring to it as the "ludicrous treatment of Turing".&lt;ref name="n176"/&gt;

==Biography==

He hailed from a distinguished family that was originally from [[Kasur]]. His father, Mohyeddin Ahmad Qureshi, was a civil servant in the [[British government]] and his mother, Khursheed Jabin, was a housewife.&lt;ref name="Story of Pakistan"&gt;{{cite web|title=Moin A. Qureshi: Former Caretaker Prime Minister of Pakistan|url=http://storyofpakistan.com/moin-a-qureshi|website=storyofpakistan.com|publisher=Story of Pakistan|accessdate=5 October 2016|date=8 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; He attended the [[Islamia College (Lahore)|Islamia College]] in [[Lahore]] and made a [[College transfer|transfer]] to the [[Government College University, Lahore|Government College University]] in Lahore where he gained [[Bachelor of Arts|B.A.]] (Honors) in [[Economics]] and received an [[Master of Arts|M.A.]] in Economics from the [[University of the Punjab|Punjab University]].&lt;ref name="Bloomberg.com"&gt;{{cite web|title=Stocks|url=https://www.bloomberg.com/research/stocks/private/person.asp?personId=137198&amp;privcapId=3480608|website=Bloomberg.com|publisher=Bloomberg.com|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He received the [[Fulbright Program|Fulbright scholarship]] and went to the [[United States]] to attend the [[Indiana University Bloomington|Indiana University]] in [[Bloomington, Indiana|Bloomington]], [[Indiana, United States|Indiana]], where he earned a [[Doctor of Philosophy|PhD]] in [[Economics]] in 1955.&lt;ref name="Rowman &amp; Littlefield"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Burki|first1=Shahid Javed|title=Historical Dictionary of Pakistan|publisher=Rowman &amp; Littlefield|isbn=9781442241480|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=rk-sBwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA472&amp;dq=moeenuddin+ahmad+qureshi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwjWroHw38TPAhUP1mMKHYGFBSEQ6wEIHTAA#v=onepage&amp;q=moeenuddin%20ahmad%20qureshi&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 October 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Public service, IMF, and World Bank===

In 1955, he returned to [[Pakistan]] and joined the country's [[Central Superior Services|civil service]] and was initially posted at the  [[Planning Commission (Pakistan)|Planning Commission]]. In 1956, he resigned from the Planning Commission and went to the [[United States]] to join the [[International Monetary Fund]] (IMF).&lt;ref name="Story of Pakistan" /&gt; He enjoyed a distinguished career at the IMF, eventually serving as economic adviser to [[Ghana]] in 1960.&lt;ref name="Rowman &amp; Littlefield" /&gt; Thereafter, he moved on to join the [[International Finance Corporation]] and eventually become its [[Executive Vice President]]  from 1974 until 1977. Qureshi oversaw the global operations which involved the financing of private enterprises and investments, including joint ventures and capital market operations in developing countries.&lt;ref name="Story of Pakistan" /&gt;

In 1981, he was invited by the then President of the [[World Bank]], [[Robert McNamara]], to join the World Bank and become the senior vice president of finance, which he remained until 1987. Eventually, he was appointed the Senior Vice President of the World Bank and oversaw its financial operations all over the world.&lt;ref name="Rowman &amp; Littlefield" /&gt; In 1991–92, he left the World Bank and settled in the United States and formed a private [[Hedge fund]], the Emerging Market Associates.&lt;ref name="Story of Pakistan" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empglobal.com/team_details.xml?id=1057 Biography on EMP Global's webpage] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081013013258/http://www.empglobal.com/team_details.xml?id=1057 |date=2008-10-13 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Acting Prime Minister of Pakistan===
{{main article|Qureshi caretaker ministry}}
In 1993, Pakistan averted a major constitutional crisis when both [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Nawaz Sharif]] and [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan]] resigned from their respective offices after an agreement brokered by the [[Pakistani military]]. The resolution was unique because an elected government had voluntarily stepped down in order to avoid possible military intervention and the resignations came through a constitutional process.&lt;ref name="Rowman &amp; Littlefield" /&gt;

The [[Chief of Army Staff (Pakistan)|Chief of Army Staff]], General [[Abdul Waheed Kakar]], and the [[Chairman Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee|Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Committee]], General [[Shamim Alam Khan|Shamim Alam]], witnessed the implementation of the agreement as [[President of Pakistan|President]] [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan|Ghulam Ishaq]] was to be replaced by the [[Chairman of the Senate of Pakistan|Chairman of the Senate]], [[Wasim Sajjad]], who took over as the [[Acting President of Pakistan|Acting President]].&lt;ref name="Rowman &amp; Littlefield" /&gt;

Meanwhile, Qureshi, who was visiting [[Singapore]] in 1993, received a telephone call from President [[Ghulam Ishaq Khan|Ghulam Ishaq]] asking him to form a [[Caretaker government|caretaker]], but [[Technocracy|technocratic, government]]. He reluctantly accepted the offer and returned to [[Islamabad]] soon after. At the time of his appointment, Qureshi was largely unknown to the public and political circles. It was, however, felt that, being a political outsider, he would remain neutral.&lt;ref name="Rowman &amp; Littlefield" /&gt;

His tenure lasted for a three-month period but saw extensive reforms made by him that were supported by an [[IMF]] standby arrangement and significant World Bank lending. He initiated a process of "payment culture" that targeted the tax evaders and loan defaulters. He also ordered the publication of the list of taxpayers that showed that the country had a small tax base and only a few paid taxes. He [[Devaluation|devaluated]] [[Pakistan Rupee|the national currency]] and increased the prices on food and common items.&lt;ref name="Infobase Publishing"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wynbrandt|first1=James|title=A Brief History of Pakistan|publisher=Infobase Publishing|isbn=9780816061846|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xQGwgJnCPZgC&amp;pg=PA241&amp;lpg=PA241&amp;dq=moeenuddin+ahmad+qureshi&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=5C5edkXgSd&amp;sig=YvSxmmBiZL5p7wrCow-s9ZDJLdk&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwja16DC58TPAhUNzmMKHT0uAv44ChDoAQggMAE#v=onepage&amp;q=moeenuddin%20ahmad%20qureshi&amp;f=false|accessdate=5 October 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also inaugurated the [[National Library of Pakistan|National Library]] and highlighted its importance in the political culture of the country.&lt;ref name="Scarecrow Press"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Coleman|first1=Sterling Joseph|title=Librarianship and Information Science in the Islamic World, 1966–1999: An Annotated Bibliography|publisher=Scarecrow Press|isbn=9780810851795|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=aJ5Pk73lVfIC&amp;pg=PA243&amp;dq=moeenuddin+ahmad+qureshi&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwidxJCu3cXPAhVJbz4KHX8bABkQ6wEILDAB#v=onepage&amp;q=moeenuddin%20ahmad%20qureshi&amp;f=false|accessdate=6 October 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qureshi passed the decree that made the [[State Bank of Pakistan|State bank]] of Pakistan an autonomous body with a view to keep the bank's business operations free from political interference. He downsized the [[Pakistan Administrative Service|administrative machinery]], and abolished the discretionary powers of the Prime Minister and the [[List of Chief Ministers of Pakistan|Chief Ministers]] which allowed them to a lot [[Apartment|residential flats]] and [[Land lot|plots]] to their "favorites".&lt;ref name="Moin Qureshi Becomes Caretaker Prime Minister"&gt;{{cite web|title=Moin Qureshi Becomes Caretaker Prime Minister|url=http://storyofpakistan.com/moin-qureshi-becomes-caretaker-prime-minister|website=Story Of Pakistan|accessdate=7 October 2016|date=1 June 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The state television, [[Pakistan Television Corporation|PTV]], and [[Pakistan Radio|Radio Pakistan]] were made independent and were given the opportunity to [[Radio broadcasting|air]] elections freely and impartially.&lt;ref name="Moin Qureshi Becomes Caretaker Prime Minister"/&gt; It goes to his credit that he undertook various endeavors in such a short period of time and made a serious effort to recover Government dues.&lt;ref name="Moin Qureshi Becomes Caretaker Prime Minister"/&gt;

Despite his attempts to harmonize the economy, Qureshi's main task was to hold nationwide general elections in 1993 to make way for an elected government to form the government. In 1993, he oversaw the [[Pakistani general election, 1993|general elections]] held that year that witnessed the return of the [[Pakistan Peoples Party]] led by [[Benazir Bhutto]].&lt;ref name="Rowman &amp; Littlefield" /&gt;

===Health and death===

In 2014, Qureshi was diagnosed with the [[Parkinson's disease]] and reportedly underwent treatment for the [[chronic obstructive pulmonary disease]] (COPD) in a local hospital.&lt;ref name="Jang Newspapers, US Bureau"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Staff reporter|title=Former Pm Moeen Qureshi Buried In Usa {{!}} Daily Jang News|url=https://jang.com.pk/latest/222195-former-pm-moeen-qureshi-buried-in-usa|accessdate=27 November 2016|work=jang.com.pk|agency=Jang Newspapers|publisher=Jang Newspapers, US Bureau|date=27 November 2016|language=[ur]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On November 23, 2016, his family announced that Qureshi had died in [[Washington D.C.]]  and was ailing for a long time while undergoing  treatment in a local hospital.&lt;ref name="ARY News, US Bureau chief"&gt;{{cite news|last1=Web Desk|title=Former caretaker PM Moeenuddin Qureshi passes away|url=http://arynews.tv/en/former-caretaker-pm-moeen-ud-din-qureshi-passes-away/|accessdate=27 November 2016|work=ARYNEWS|agency=ARY News|publisher=ARY News, US Bureau chief|date=23 November 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was suffering from a lung infection and buried in Washington D.C..&lt;ref name="News International, US Bureau"&gt;{{cite news|last1=News International|title=Former caretaker PM Moeen Qureshi dies|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/latest/166865-Former-caretaker-PM-Moeen-Qureshi-dies|accessdate=27 November 2016|work=www.thenews.com.pk|agency=News International|publisher=News International, US Bureau}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Legacy==

===EMP Global and private sector===

After congratulating and witnessing [[Benazir Bhutto]]'s oath administered by the [[Acting President of Pakistan|Acting President]] [[Wasim Sajjad]] alongside the [[Chief Justice of Pakistan|Chief Justice]] of Pakistan, Qureshi returned to [[New York City|New York]], [[United States]], in 1993 to established the private [[hedge fund]] equity, the [[EMP Global]].&lt;ref name="Story of Pakistan" /&gt;&lt;ref name="EMP Global About Us"&gt;{{cite web|title=EMP Global About Us|url=http://www.empwdc.com/aboutus.html|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20131213013745/http://www.empwdc.com/aboutus.html|dead-url=yes|archive-date=13 December 2013|website=www.empwdc.com|publisher=EMP Global About Us|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; Qureshi was involved in forging an affiliation with the international insurance company, [[American International Group]] (AIG), for a number of years. [[AIG]] held a minority stake in EMP and served as a  sponsor of, as well as a major investor in, a number of funds bearing its name for which EMP served as Principal Adviser.&lt;ref name="John Wiley &amp; Sons"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Greenberg|first1=Maurice R.|last2=Cunningham|first2=Lawrence A.|title=The AIG Story|publisher=John Wiley &amp; Sons|isbn=9781118519578|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=2VsrihmiUQ0C&amp;pg=PT126&amp;lpg=PT126&amp;dq=moin+qureshi+AIG&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=rUBsspjrs7&amp;sig=GiFHNhXjd0fL1Zq1f0yXTJ3iTQw&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0ahUKEwi0yOeGksjPAhUKxGMKHVlWA_cQ6AEITzAK#v=onepage&amp;q=moin%20qureshi%20AIG&amp;f=false|accessdate=7 October 2016|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt; EMP bought out AIG's stake and became an independent company in 2005.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.empglobal.com/1132.xml History on EMP Global Website] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20101121113745/http://www.empglobal.com/1132.xml |date=2010-11-21 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After his departure from Pakistan, Qureshi received criticism that, in his last days at the office, he made a large number of promotions and other administrative decisions in favor of his relatives.&lt;ref name="Moin Qureshi Becomes Caretaker Prime Minister" /&gt; In 2014, his name was reportedly mentioned by [[Imran Khan]] when he led the [[Azadi March]] against Prime Minister [[Nawaz Sharif]].&lt;ref name="The News, Abbas"&gt;{{cite web|last1=Abbas|first1=Mazhar|title=Is political turmoil in the offing?|url=https://www.thenews.com.pk/print/113770-Is-political-turmoil-in-the-offing|website=www.thenews.com.pk|publisher=The News, Abbas|accessdate=7 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Personal life and wealth===

Qureshi was married to an [[Americans|American]] citizen, Lilo Elizabeth Richter, and has four children: two sons and two daughters.

==Biography==
Halleslevens was born in [[La Libertad, Chontales]]. In 1974, he joined the "Juan José Quezada" guerrilla column, which attacked the house of the Minister of Agriculture under the regime of [[Anastasio Somoza Debayle]] and negotiated for the freedom of various political prisoners, including Ortega.&lt;ref&gt;http://conexiones.com.ni/elecciones/downloads/vicepresidentes/2.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; During the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front#Sandinista rule (1979-1990)|1980s]], Halleslevens was chief of the Army Political Directorate and, later, Military Counterintelligence. In the aftermath of [[Hurricane Joan]] in 1988, he led the evacuation of [[El Rama]].

Halleslevens served as Commander in Chief of the [[Military of Nicaragua|Nicaraguan Armed Forces]] from 2005 until his retirement from military life in 2010. In 2011, the [[Sandinista National Liberation Front]] nominated Halleslevens as Ortega's running mate. Ortega was [[Nicaraguan general election, 2011|reelected that year]], and Halleslevens took office, replacing [[Jaime Morales Carazo]].

'''Sandrina Malakiano''' (born 24 November 1971 in [[Bangkok]]) is a former news presenter of [[Metro TV]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=/2005/2/21/latest/21553Indonesian&amp;sec=latest|title=Indonesian Foreign Ministry says kidnapped journalists released|date=February 21, 2005|publisher=The Star|accessdate=8 January 2011|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110622085540/http://thestar.com.my/news/story.asp?file=%2F2005%2F2%2F21%2Flatest%2F21553Indonesian&amp;sec=latest|archivedate=22 June 2011|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; an [[Indonesia]]n news television channel. She was runner-up in the "Best News Presenter" category of the 2002 [[Asian Television Awards]]. Sandrina was named Best News Presenter in 2001 and 2003, and Best Current Affairs Presenter in the 2005 [[Asian Television Awards]] respectively.

== Early years ==
Sandrina was born in Thailand but was raised in Bali. She graduated from university as a Civil Engineer. Sandrina started her career in the broadcasting world in Bali when she became a radio show host in 1990 and after a few months she joined TVRI station of Denpasar Bali as a newscaster. In 1996, she joined ANTV Jakarta as a newscaster and sportscaster. Then, in 1997, she worked as a freelance host for several TV programs, such as ''Travel Asia and Beyond'' and 'Wild Things''. '' 

== Newscast career ==
From 1998 to 2000, Sandrina worked as Public Relations Manager of PT.

In 2000 Sandrina joined Metro TV, the first 24-hour news channel in Indonesia, as the station's main news and current affairs anchor. Right after she went on the Hajj pilgrimage in 2006, Sandrina decided to wear the veil (hijab), hence she was unable to further pursue her career there as wearing hijab was against the company's 'On Air Look' policy for news anchors. 

Sandrina actively teaches Broadcast Journalism and Public Speaking. She also still hosts On Air as well as Off Air programs on a freelance basis

Sandrina and her husband also own and manage two cafes/restaurants in Jakarta, named 'Abuella'.. 

== Social activism ==
As Ambassador for the National Campaign to Fight Cervical Cancer, for the last decade Sandrina has continuously promoted and educated the public about Cervical Cancer Prevention in Indonesia. She is also involved in many different forms of social activities, such as in the field of education. 

== Family life ==
Sandrina married political analyst [[Eep Saefulloh Fatah]] at Masjidil Haram Mosque, in Makkah Al Mukarramah, on 6 May 2005 and is now a mother of three children.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3326">'''Sharleen Spiteri''' was an [[HIV]]+ [[sex worker]], who became the focus of significant media, public and [[New South Wales Government]] attention in [[Australia]] after appearing on the ''[[60 Minutes (Australian TV program)|60 Minutes]]'' television programme in 1989, where she revealed in an interview that she sometimes had sex with clients without revealing her illness or using [[condom]]s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/rn/hindsight/stories/2010/2848373.htm |title=ABC Radio National Hindsight program 'Shutting Down Sharleen' (2010) |publisher=Abc.net.au |date= |accessdate=2012-05-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url=https://books.google.com/?id=1trSx2c_pEYC&amp;pg=PA188&amp;lpg=PA188&amp;dq=sharleen+hiv#v=onepage&amp;q=sharleen%20hiv&amp;f=false |title=Learning to trust: Australian responses to AIDS By Paul Sendziuk |date=1991-07-01 |accessdate=2012-05-22|isbn=9780868407180 |last1=Sendziuk |first1=Paul }}&lt;/ref&gt;

After the ''60 Minutes'' programme went to air, Spiteri was forcibly detained by [[New South Wales Police]] and Health Department authorities, using an obscure section of the Public Health Act (Section 32a), originally intended for the control of [[tuberculosis]]. She was kept in detention in [[Prince Henry Hospital]]'s [[AIDS]] ward, and then Rozelle Mental Hospital for several weeks.

Into the early 1990s Spiteri's case continued to spark national public debate. A new law was introduced in [[New South Wales]], colloquially known as "Sharleen's Law" where [[informed consent]] prior to [[sexual intercourse]] was required.

Although there were many other sex workers in the community who were also HIV+, in similar situations and known to authorities, after her initial release Spiteri came under subsequent [[public health]] orders (as well as other agreements undisclosed by the NSW Health Department), spending much of the remaining 16 years of her life under supervision of [[health worker]]s as a public patient of the NSW Health system. She died in 2005.

'''Sharon Marie Tate Polanski''' (January 24, 1943&amp;nbsp;– August 9, 1969) was an American actress and model. During the 1960s, she played small [[television]] roles before appearing in films and was regularly featured in fashion [[magazine]]s as a model and [[cover girl]]. After receiving positive reviews for her [[comedy|comedic]] and dramatic acting performances, Tate was hailed as one of [[Hollywood]]'s most promising newcomers. 

She made her film debut in 1961 in ''[[Barrabas (film)|Barabbas]]'' with [[Anthony Quinn]]. She was seen next in 1966 with the [[occult]]-themed ''[[Eye of the Devil]]''. Her most remembered performance was as Jennifer North in the 1967 [[Cult film|cult classic]] film, [[Valley of the Dolls (film)|''Valley of the Dolls'']], earning her a [[Golden Globe Award]] nomination. Tate's last completed film, ''[[The Thirteen Chairs|12+1]]'', was released posthumously in 1969, with the actress receiving [[Billing (filmmaking)|top billing]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Sandford | first=C. | title=Polanski: A Biography | publisher=St. Martin's Press | year=2009 | isbn=978-0-230-61176-4 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=41rgCgAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA122 | language=sv | ref=harv | access-date=December 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last=Goble | first=A. | title=The Complete Index to Literary Sources in Film | publisher=De Gruyter | year=1999 | isbn=978-3-11-095194-3 | url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Yyqc0Qa6b60C&amp;pg=PA366 | ref=harv | access-date=December 24, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On January 20, 1968, Tate married [[Roman Polanski]], her [[film director|director]] and co-star in 1967's ''[[The Fearless Vampire Killers]]''. On August 9, 1969, Tate and four others were [[Tate murders|murdered]] by members of the [[Manson Family]] in the home she shared with Polanski. At the time of her death, she was eight-and-a-half months pregnant with the couple's son.&lt;ref name="BugliosiGentry1974" /&gt;

A decade after Tate's murder, the actress' mother, [[Doris Tate]], in response to the growing [[Cult following|cult status]] of the killers and the possibility of them being granted [[parole]], organized a public campaign that resulted in amendments to the [[California criminal law]]. Tate's mother went on to say that the law would "help transform Sharon's legacy from murder victim to a symbol of victims' rights". A book by Tate's sister, Debra Tate,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://3.bp.blogspot.com/-L83uRRJ77X0/UR2kHKaDElI/AAAAAAAACUY/52cgvo79Otk/s1600/Debra+Tate.jpg|title=Photo of Debra Tate|website=bp.Blogspot.com|access-date=January 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; titled ''Sharon Tate: Recollection,'' was released in 2014.&lt;ref name=book /&gt;

== Life and career ==

=== Childhood and early acting career ===
Sharon Tate was born in [[Dallas]], Texas, the eldest of three daughters, to Colonel Paul James Tate (1922–2005),&lt;ref&gt;[http://articles.latimes.com/2005/may/24/local/me-passings24.2 Paul Tate, 82; Investigated Murder of Daughter Sharon Tate]. ''Los Angeles Times'' (May 24, 2005).&lt;/ref&gt; a [[United States Army]] officer, and his wife, Doris Gwendolyn ([[Maiden and married names|née]] Willett). At six months of age, Tate won the "Miss Tiny Tot of Dallas Pageant", but her parents had no show business ambitions for their daughter. Paul Tate was promoted and transferred several times. By the age of 16, as a [[military brat]], Tate had lived in six cities and reportedly found it difficult to maintain friendships. Her family described her as shy and lacking in self-confidence. As an adult, Tate commented that people would misinterpret her shyness as aloofness until they knew her better.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

Tate attended Chief Joseph Junior High School (now Chief Joseph Middle School) from September 1955 to June 1958, and Columbia High School (now Richland High School) in [[Richland, Washington]], from September 1958 to October 1959.  She attended Irvin High School in [[El Paso, Texas]], from late fall 1959 to April 1960; and Vicenza American High School in [[Vicenza|Vicenza, Italy]], from April to June 1960. Tate graduated from Vicenza American High School in 1961.

As she matured, people commented on Tate's beauty; she began entering [[beauty pageant]]s, winning the title of "Miss Richland" in Washington in 1959. She spoke of her ambition to study [[psychiatry]], and also stated her intention to compete in the "[[Miss Washington]]" pageant in 1960; however, before she could do either, her father received orders to be stationed in Italy. With her family relocating in [[Verona]], Tate learned that she had become a local celebrity owing to the publication of a photograph of her in a swimsuit on the cover of the military newspaper ''[[Stars and Stripes (newspaper)|Stars and Stripes]]''. She discovered a kinship with other students at the American school she attended in nearby Vicenza, recognizing that their backgrounds and feelings of separation were similar to her own, and for the first time in her life began to form lasting friendships.

[[File:Max Baer Jr, Nancy Kulp and Sharon Tate in The Beverly Hillbillies, The Giant Jackrabbit episode.jpg|thumb|alt=A black and white screenshot from the television series, ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' shows Max Baer, Jr. as Jethro, Nancy Kulp as Jane Hathaway, and Sharon Tate as Janet Trego, a secretary. Tate is wearing a business suit and a dark wig, and is watching Miss Hathaway|Sharon Tate (at right wearing a dark wig) as Janet Trego in the 1964 "Giant Jackrabbit" episode of ''The Beverly Hillbillies'' with [[Max Baer, Jr.]] and [[Nancy Kulp]].]]

Tate and her friends became interested in the filming of ''[[Hemingway's Adventures of a Young Man]]'', which was being made nearby with [[Paul Newman]], [[Susan Strasberg]], and [[Richard Beymer]], and obtained parts as [[Extra  (acting)|film extras]]. Beymer noticed Tate in the crowd and introduced himself, and the two dated during the production of the film, with Beymer encouraging Tate to pursue a film career. In 1960, Tate was employed by the singer [[Pat Boone]] and appeared with him in an episode of the television series ''[[The Pat Boone Chevy Showroom]]'' that was filmed in [[Venice]].

Later that year, when ''[[Barabbas (1961 film)|Barabbas]]'' was being filmed near Verona, Tate was once again hired as an extra. Actor [[Jack Palance]] was impressed by her appearance and her attitude, although her role was too small to judge her talent. He arranged a [[screen test]] for her in [[Rome]], but this did not lead to further work. Tate returned to the United States alone, saying she wanted to further her studies, but tried to find film work. After a few months, Doris Tate, who feared for her daughter's safety, suffered a [[Mental breakdown|nervous breakdown]] and her daughter was persuaded to return to Italy. {{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

The family returned to the United States in 1962, and Tate moved to [[Los Angeles]], where she contacted [[Richard Beymer]]'s agent, Harold Gefsky. After their first meeting, Gefsky agreed to represent her, and secured work for her in television and magazine advertisements. In 1963, he introduced her to [[Martin Ransohoff]], director of [[Filmways|Filmways, Inc.]], who signed her to a seven-year contract. She was considered for the role of Billie Jo Bradley on [[CBS]]'s sitcom ''[[Petticoat Junction]]'', but Ransohoff believed that she lacked confidence and the role was given to [[Jeannine Riley]]. Ransohoff gave Tate small parts in ''[[Mister Ed]]'' and ''[[The Beverly Hillbillies]]'' to help her gain experience, but was unwilling to allow her to play a more substantial role. "Mr. Ransohoff didn't want the audience to see me till I was ready," Tate was quoted in a 1967 article in ''[[Playboy]]''.&lt;ref name="Leaming1981" /&gt;

During this time, Tate met the French actor [[Philippe Forquet]] and began a relationship with him in 1963. They became engaged, but their relationship was volatile and they frequently quarreled. Career pressures drove them apart and they broke up the next year in 1964.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.whosdatedwho.com/dating/sharon-tate-and-philippe-forquet|title=Sharon Tate and Philippe Forquet|website=Who's Dated Who?|access-date=2018-11-26}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964, she met [[Jay Sebring]], a former sailor who had established himself as a leading hair stylist in [[Hollywood, Los Angeles, California|Hollywood]]. Tate later said that Sebring's nature was especially gentle, but when he proposed marriage, she declined. She said she would retire from acting as soon as she married, and at that time she intended to focus on her career.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

=== Film career ===
In 1964, Tate made a screen test for [[Sam Peckinpah]] opposite [[Steve McQueen]] for the film ''[[The Cincinnati Kid]]''. Ransohoff and Peckinpah agreed that Tate's timidity and lack of experience would cause her to flounder in such a large part, and she was rejected in favor of [[Tuesday Weld]].{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} She continued to gain experience with minor television appearances, and after she [[audition]]ed unsuccessfully for the role of Liesl in the film version of ''[[The Sound of Music (film)|The Sound of Music]]'', Ransohoff gave Tate walk-on roles in two motion pictures in which he was the producer: ''[[The Americanization of Emily]]'' and ''[[The Sandpiper]]''.&lt;ref name="BugliosiGentry1974" /&gt; In late 1965, Ransohoff finally gave Tate her first major role in a motion picture in the film ''[[Eye of the Devil]]'', costarring [[David Niven]], [[Deborah Kerr]], [[Donald Pleasence]], and [[David Hemmings]].&lt;ref name="Sanders2002" /&gt;

[[File:Sharon Tate in Eye of the Devil trailer 1.jpg|thumb|left|Tate in the 1966 film ''[[Eye of the Devil]]''.|236x236px]]
Tate and Sebring traveled to [[London]] to prepare for filming, where she met the [[Alexandrian Wicca]]n High Priest and High Priestess [[Alex Sanders (Wiccan)|Alex]] and [[Maxine Sanders]].&lt;ref&gt;Sanders, Maxine (2008). ''Fire Child: The Life and Magic of Maxine Sanders, Witch Queen''. Oxford: Mandrake Press. Page 107-108.&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, as part of Ransohoff's promotion of Tate, he arranged the production of a short [[Documentary film|documentary]] called ''All Eyes on Sharon Tate'', to be released at the same time as ''Eye of the Devil''. It included an interview with ''Eye of the Devil'' director [[J. Lee Thompson]], who expressed his initial doubts about Tate's potential with the comment, "We even agreed that if after the first two weeks Sharon was not quite making it, we would put her back in cold storage," but added he soon realized Tate was "tremendously exciting".{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

Tate played Odile, a witch who exerts a mysterious power over a landowner, played by Niven, and his wife, played by Kerr. Although she did not have as many lines as the other actors, Tate's performance was considered crucial to the film, and she was required, more than the other cast members, to set an ethereal tone. Niven described her as a "great discovery", and Kerr said that with "a reasonable amount of luck" Tate would be a great success.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} In interviews, Tate commented on her good fortune in working with such professionals in her first film and said that she had learned a lot about acting simply by watching Kerr at work. Much of the filming took place in France, and Sebring returned to Los Angeles to fulfill his business obligations. After filming, Tate remained in London, where she immersed herself in the fashion world and nightclubs. Around this time, she met [[Roman Polanski]].

Tate and Polanski later agreed that neither of them had been impressed by the other when they first met. Polanski was planning ''[[The Fearless Vampire Killers]]'', which was being coproduced by Ransohoff, and had decided that he wanted the red-headed actress [[Jill St. John]] for the female lead. Ransohoff insisted that Polanski cast Tate, and after meeting with her, he agreed that she would be suitable on the condition that she wore a red wig during filming.

The company traveled to Italy for filming where Tate's fluent Italian proved useful in communicating with the local crew members. A perfectionist, Polanski had little patience with the inexperienced Tate, and said in an interview that one scene had required 70 takes before he was satisfied. In addition to directing, Polanski also played one of the main characters, a guileless young man who is intrigued by Tate's character and begins a romance with her.

As filming progressed, Polanski praised her performances and her confidence grew. They began a relationship, and Tate moved into Polanski's London apartment after filming ended. Jay Sebring traveled to London, where he insisted on meeting Polanski. Although friends later said he was devastated, he befriended Polanski and remained Tate's closest confidante. Polanski later commented that Sebring was a lonely and isolated person, who viewed Tate and himself as his family.{{sfn|Polanski|1984|p=}}

Tate played the role of Malibu and the film was intended to capitalize on the popularity of beach movies and the music of such artists as [[the Beach Boys]] and [[Jan and Dean]]. Tate's character, billed by [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] publicity as "Malibu, Queen of the Surf", wore little more than a bikini for most of the film. Disappointed with the film, she began referring to herself sarcastically as "sexy little me". Before the film's release, a major publishing campaign [[Coppertone (sunscreen)|Coppertone sunsscreen]] featured Tate. The film opened to poor reviews and mediocre ticket sales, and Tate was quoted as confiding to a reporter, "It's a terrible movie", before adding, "Sometimes I say things I shouldn't. I guess I'm too outspoken."{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

Polanski returned to the United States, and was contracted by the head of [[Paramount Pictures]], [[Robert Evans]], to direct and write the screenplay for ''[[Rosemary's Baby (film)|Rosemary's Baby]]'', which was based on [[Ira Levin]]'s novel of the [[Rosemary's Baby (novel)|same name]].&lt;ref name="Sanders2002" /&gt; Polanski later admitted that he had wanted Tate to star in the film and had hoped that someone would suggest her, as he felt it inappropriate to make the suggestion himself. The producers did not suggest Tate, and [[Mia Farrow]] was cast. Tate reportedly provided ideas for some of the key scenes, including the scene in which the protagonist, Rosemary, is impregnated.{{Citation needed|date=July 2009}} A frequent visitor to the set, she was photographed there by ''[[Esquire (magazine)|Esquire]]'' and the resulting photographs generated considerable publicity for both Tate and the film.

A March 1967 article about Tate in ''[[Playboy]]'' began, "This is the year that Sharon Tate happens&amp;nbsp;..." and included six nude or partially nude photographs taken by Roman Polanski during filming of ''The Fearless Vampire Killers''.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} Tate was optimistic: ''Eye of the Devil'' and ''The Fearless Vampire Killers'' were each due for release, and she had been signed to play a major role in the film version of ''[[Valley of the Dolls (film)|Valley of the Dolls]]''. One of the all-time bestsellers, the film version was highly publicized and anticipated, and while Tate acknowledged that such a prominent role should further her career, she confided to Polanski that she did not like either the book or the script.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

[[Patty Duke]], [[Barbara Parkins]], and [[Judy Garland]] were cast as the other leads. [[Susan Hayward]] replaced Garland a few weeks later when she was dismissed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Studio to auction star contracts |work=BBC News |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/entertainment/6197589.stm |access-date=April 7, 2007 | date=December 20, 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Director [[Mark Robson]] was highly critical of the three principal actresses, but according to Duke, directed most of his criticism at Tate. Duke later said Robson "continually treated [Tate] like an imbecile, which she definitely was not, and she was very attuned and sensitive to this treatment".{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} Polanski later quoted Robson as saying to him, "That's a great girl you're living with. Few actresses have her kind of vulnerability. She's got a great future."{{sfn|Polanski|1984|p=}}

In interviews during production, Tate expressed an affinity for her character, Jennifer North, an aspiring actress admired only for her body. Some magazines commented that Tate was viewed similarly and ''[[Look (American magazine)|Look]]'' published an unfavorable article about the three lead actresses, describing Tate as "a hopelessly stupid and vain starlet".{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} Tate, Duke, and Parkins developed a close friendship that continued after the completion of the film. During the shooting of ''Valley of the Dolls'', Tate confided to Parkins that she was "madly in love" with Polanski.&lt;ref name="Leaming1981" /&gt; "Yes, there's no doubt that Roman is the man in my life," Tate was quoted as saying in the New York ''Sunday News''.&lt;ref name="Leaming1981" /&gt; Tate promoted the film enthusiastically. She frequently commented on her admiration for [[Lee Grant]], with whom she had played several dramatic scenes. Tate was quoted as saying, "I learned a great deal about acting in [''Valley of the Dolls''], particularly in my scenes with Lee Grant.... She knows what acting is all about and everything she does, from little mannerisms to delivering her lines, is pure professionalism."{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

A journalist asked Tate to comment on her nude scene, and she replied,

&lt;blockquote&gt;I have no qualms about it at all. I don't see any difference between being stark naked or fully dressed&amp;nbsp;— if it's part of the job and it's done with meaning and intention. I honestly don't understand the big fuss made over nudity and sex in films. It's silly. On TV, the children can watch people murdering each other, which is a very unnatural thing, but they can't watch two people in the very natural process of making love. Now, really, that doesn't make any sense, does it?{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}&lt;/blockquote&gt;

An edited version of ''The Fearless Vampire Killers'' was released, and Polanski expressed disgust at Ransohoff for "butchering" his film. ''[[Newsweek]]'' called it "a witless travesty", and it was not profitable. Tate's performance was largely ignored in reviews, and when she was mentioned, it was usually in relation to her nude scenes. ''Eye of the Devil'' was released shortly after, and [[Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer]] attempted to build interest in Tate with its press release describing her as "one of the screen's most exciting new personalities". The film failed to find an audience, and most reviews were indifferent, neither praising nor condemning it. ''[[The New York Times]]'' wrote that one of the few highlights was Tate's "chillingly beautiful but expressionless performance".{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

The ''All Eyes on Sharon Tate'' documentary was used to publicize the film. Its 14 minutes consisted of a number of scenes depicting Tate filming ''Eye of the Devil'', dancing in nightclubs, and sightseeing around London, and also contained a brief interview with her. Asked about her acting ambitions, she replied, "I don't fool myself. I can't see myself doing [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]]." She spoke of her hopes of finding a niche in comedy, and in other interviews she expressed her desire to become "a light comedienne in the [[Carole Lombard]] style".{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} She discussed the type of contemporary actress she wanted to emulate and explained that there were two in particular that she was influenced by: [[Faye Dunaway]] and [[Catherine Deneuve]]. Of the latter, she said, "I'd like to be an American Catherine Deneuve. She plays beautiful, sensitive, deep parts with a little bit of intelligence behind them."&lt;ref name="photoscreen"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.geocities.com/cean2/photoscreen.htm |first=Johnny |last=Columbus |title=Sharon Tate – Venus on a Treadmill |work=Photo Screen |date=June 1968 |access-date=October 10, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091023211133/http://geocities.com/cean2/photoscreen.htm|archivedate=October 23, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in the year, ''Valley of the Dolls'' opened to almost uniformly negative reviews. [[Bosley Crowther]] wrote in ''The New York Times'', "all a fairly respectful admirer of movies can do is laugh at it and turn away".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Bosley |last=Crowther |title=Valley of the Dolls |url=http://movies2.nytimes.com/mem/movies/review.html?title1=VALLEY%20OF%20THE%20DOLLS%20%28MOVIE%29%20&amp;reviewer=By%20BOSLEY%20CROWTHER%20&amp;pdate=19671216 |work=The New York Times |date=December 16, 1967 |access-date=July 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Newsweek'' said that the film "has no more sense of its own ludicrousness than a village idiot stumbling in manure", but a later article read: "Astoundingly photogenic, infinitely curvaceous, Sharon Tate is one of the most smashing young things to hit Hollywood in a long time."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=The New American Beauties |url=http://www.geocities.com/cean2/covers1a.htm |work=Newsweek |date=March 4, 1968 |access-date=October 10, 2009|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091024085030/http://geocities.com/cean2/covers1a.htm|archivedate=October 24, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; The three lead actresses were castigated in numerous publications, including ''The Saturday Review'', which wrote, "Ten years ago&amp;nbsp;... Parkins, Duke, and Tate would more likely have been playing the hat check girls than movie-queens; they are totally lacking in style, authority, or charm."{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} ''[[The Hollywood Reporter]]'' provided some positive comments, such as, "Sharon Tate emerges as the film's most sympathetic character&amp;nbsp;... [[William Daniels (cinematographer)|William H. Daniels]]' photographic caress of her faultless face and enormous absorbent eyes is stunning."{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} [[Roger Ebert]] of the ''[[Chicago Sun-Times]]'' praised Tate as "a wonder to behold", but after describing the dialogue in one scene as "the most offensive and appalling vulgarity ever thrown up by any civilization", concluded that, "I will be unable to take her any more seriously as a [[sex symbol]] than [[Raquel Welch]]."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Roger |last=Ebert |authorlink=Roger Ebert |title=Valley of the Dolls |work=Chicago Sun-Times |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19671227/REVIEWS/712270301/1023 |date=December 27, 1967 |access-date=July 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Marriage to Roman Polanski ===
In late 1967, Tate and Polanski returned to London and were frequent subjects of newspaper and magazine articles. Tate was depicted as being untraditional and modern, and was quoted as saying couples should live together before marrying. They were married in [[Chelsea, London]], on January 20, 1968, with considerable publicity. Polanski was dressed in what the press described as "[[1900s in Western fashion|Edwardian finery]]", while Tate was attired in a white minidress.&lt;ref name="Sanders2002" /&gt; The couple moved into Polanski's [[mews]] house off Eaton Square in Belgravia, London.&lt;ref name="Leaming1981" /&gt; Photographer Peter Evans later described them as "the imperfect couple. They were the [[Douglas Fairbanks]]/[[Mary Pickford]] of our time&amp;nbsp;... Cool, nomadic, talented, and nicely shocking."{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

While Tate reportedly wanted a traditional marriage, Polanski remained somewhat promiscuous and described Tate's attitude to his infidelity as "Sharon's big hang-up". He reminded Tate that she had promised that she would not try to change him.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} Tate accepted Polanski's conditions, though she confided to friends that she hoped he would change. Peter Evans quoted Tate as saying, "We have a good arrangement. Roman lies to me and I pretend to believe him."&lt;ref name="times"&gt;{{cite news|first=Peter |last=Evans |title=Sufferings of the great seducer |url=http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article547335.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1254102174470 |archive-url=https://archive.is/20130114045046/http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/article547335.ece?print=yes&amp;randnum=1254102174470 |dead-url=yes |archive-date=January 14, 2013 |work=The Sunday Times |date=July 24, 2005 |access-date=August 11, 2005 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Polanski urged Tate to end her association with Martin Ransohoff, and Tate began to place less importance on her career until Polanski told her he wanted to be married to "a [[hippie]], not a housewife." The couple returned to Los Angeles and quickly became part of a social group that included some of the most successful young people in the film industry, including [[Warren Beatty]], [[Jacqueline Bisset]], [[Leslie Caron]], [[Joan Collins]], [[Mia Farrow]], [[Jane Fonda]], [[Peter Fonda]], [[Laurence Harvey]], [[Steve McQueen]], [[Joanna Pettet]] and [[Peter Sellers]]; older film stars like [[Yul Brynner]], [[Kirk Douglas]], [[Henry Fonda]] and [[Danny Kaye]]; musicians such as [[Jim Morrison]] and [[The Mamas &amp; the Papas]]; and record producer [[Terry Melcher]] and his girlfriend, actress [[Candice Bergen]]. Jay Sebring remained one of the couple's more frequent companions. Polanski's circle of friends included people he had known since his youth in [[Poland]] such as [[Tate murders|Wojciech Frykowski]] and Frykowski's girlfriend, coffee heiress [[Tate murders|Abigail Folger]]. Tate and Polanski moved into the [[Chateau Marmont Hotel]] in Los Angeles for a few months {{sfn|Polanski|1984|p=}} until they arranged to lease [[Patty Duke]]'s home on Summit Ridge Drive in Beverly Hills during the latter part of 1968.{{sfn|Polanski|1984|p=}} The Polanski house was often full of strangers, and Tate regarded the casual atmosphere as part of the "free spirit" of the times, saying that she did not mind who came into her home as her motto was "live and let live."{{sfn|Polanski|1984|p=}} Her close friend [[Leslie Caron]] later commented that the Polanskis were too trusting&amp;nbsp;— "to the point of recklessness"&amp;nbsp;— and that she had been alarmed by it.&lt;ref name="ellisamburn"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Ellis Amburn |last=Amburn |first=Ellis |title=The Sexiest Man Alive: A Biography of Warren Beatty |url=https://books.google.com/?id=vgqPOQAACAAJ |year=2003 |publisher=Virgin Books |isbn=1-85227-919-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the summer of 1968, Tate began ''[[The Wrecking Crew (1968 film)|The Wrecking Crew]]'' (1969), a comedy in which she played Freya Carlson, an accident-prone spy, who was also a romantic interest for star [[Dean Martin]], playing [[Matt Helm]]. She performed her own stunts and was taught martial arts by [[Bruce Lee]]. The film was successful and brought Tate strong reviews, with many reviewers praising her comedic performance. ''The New York Times'' critic Vincent Canby criticized the film, but wrote, "The only nice thing is Sharon Tate, a tall, really great-looking girl."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=Vincent |last=Canby |title=The Screen: Matt Helm Back in Town |work=The New York Times |date=February 6, 1969 |access-date=October 10, 2009 |url=https://movies.nytimes.com/movie/review?_r=2&amp;res=9E07E3DC1E30EE3BBC4E53DFB4668382679EDE}}&lt;/ref&gt; Martin commented that he intended to make another "Matt Helm" film and that he wanted Tate to reprise her role.

Around this time Tate was feted as a promising newcomer. She was nominated for a [[Golden Globe Award]] as "New Star of the Year – Actress" for her performance in ''Valley of the Dolls''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/30188 |title=Sharon Tate |publisher=Golden Globes.org |access-date=July 16, 2005 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20120524205629/http://www.goldenglobes.org/browse/member/30188 |archivedate=May 24, 2012 |df=mdy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

She placed fourth behind [[Mia Farrow]], [[Judy Geeson]] and [[Katharine Houghton]] for a "Golden [[Laurel Awards|Laurel" award]] as the year's "Most Promising Newcomer" with the results published in the ''Motion Picture Exhibitor'' magazine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.imdb.com/Sections/Awards/Laurel_Awards/1968 |title=Golden Laurel Awards 1968 |access-date=January 4, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; She was also runner-up to [[Lynn Redgrave]] in the ''Motion Picture Herald''{{'}}s poll for "The Star of Tomorrow," in which box-office drawing power was the main criterion for inclusion on the list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sharontate.net/bio4.html |title= Sharon's Biography — The Tide Turns |publisher=SharonTate.net |access-date=July 16, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; These results indicated that her career was beginning to accelerate, and for her next film, Tate negotiated a fee of $150,000.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

She became pregnant near the end of 1968, and on February 15, 1969, she and Polanski moved to [[10050 Cielo Drive]] in [[Benedict Canyon, Los Angeles|Benedict Canyon]].&lt;ref name="Leaming1981" /&gt; The house previously had been occupied by their friends [[Terry Melcher]] and [[Candice Bergen]]. Tate and Polanski had visited it several times, and Tate was thrilled to learn it was available, referring to it as her "love house." At their new home, the Polanskis continued to be popular hosts for their large group of friends, although some of their friends still worried about the strange types who continued to show up at their parties.&lt;ref name="Leaming1981" /&gt; Encouraged by positive reviews of her comedic performances, Tate chose the comedy ''Twelve Plus One'' (1969) as her next project, as she later explained, largely for the opportunity to co-star with [[Orson Welles]]. In March 1969, she traveled to Italy to begin filming, and Polanski went to London to work on ''[[The Day of the Dolphin]]'' (1973). Frykowski and Folger moved into the Cielo Drive house.

After completing ''Twelve Plus One'', Tate joined Polanski in London. She posed in their apartment for photographer [[Terry O'Neill (photographer)|Terry O'Neill]] in casual domestic scenes such as opening baby gifts, and completed a series of glamour photographs for the British magazine ''[[Queen (magazine)|Queen]]''. A journalist asked Tate in a late July interview if she believed in fate, to which she replied, "Certainly. My whole life has been decided by fate. I think something more powerful than we are decides our fates for us. I know one thing — I've never planned anything that ever happened to me."{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

She returned from London to Los Angeles on July 20, 1969, traveling alone on the ''[[Queen Elizabeth 2|QE2]]''. Polanski was due to return on August 12 in time for the birth, and he had asked Frykowski and Folger to stay in the house with Tate until his return.&lt;ref&gt;''Horror and Those Who Caused It'' {{ISBN|978-0-648-13682-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Murder ===
{{See also|Tate murders|}}
On August 8, 1969, Tate was two weeks from giving birth. She entertained two friends, actress [[Joanna Pettet]] and singer [[Barbara Lewis]], for lunch at her home, confiding in them her disappointment at Polanski's delay in returning from London. That afternoon, Polanski telephoned her as did her younger sister, Debra, who called to ask if she and their sister, Patti, could spend the night with her. Tate declined, offering to have them over another time. Later that evening, Tate dined at her favorite restaurant, [[El Coyote Cafe]], with [[Jay Sebring]], [[Wojciech Frykowski]], and [[Abigail Folger]], returning at about 10:30&amp;nbsp;p.m.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

Shortly after midnight, they were murdered by members of [[Charles Manson]]'s "[[Manson Family|family]]" and their bodies were discovered the following morning by Tate's housekeeper, Winifred Chapman. Police arrived at the scene to find the body of a young man, later identified as [[Tate murders#Murders|Steven Parent]], shot dead in his car, which was in the driveway. Inside the house, the bodies of Tate and Sebring were found in the living room; a long rope tied around each of their necks connected them. On the front lawn lay the bodies of Frykowski and Folger. All of the victims, except Parent, had been stabbed numerous times. The [[coroner]]'s report for Tate noted that she had been stabbed sixteen times, and that "five of the wounds were in and of themselves fatal".&lt;ref name="BugliosiGentry1974" /&gt;

Police took the only survivor at the address, the property's caretaker [[Tate murders#Murders|William Garretson]], in for questioning. Garretson lived in the guest house that was located on the property, but a short distance from the house, and not immediately visible. As the first suspect, Garretson was questioned and submitted to a [[polygraph]] test. Garretson stated that Parent had visited him at approximately 11:30&amp;nbsp;p.m. and left shortly thereafter. Garretson informed police that he had no involvement in the murders and did not know anything that could help the investigation. Police accepted his explanation and he was released.

[[File:Tate family grave.JPG|thumb|right|The Tate family burial plot at [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City]], California, in which Tate, her unborn son Paul, mother [[Doris Tate|Doris]], and sister Patti are interred.]]
Polanski was informed of the murders and returned to Los Angeles where police, unable to determine a motive, questioned him about his wife and friends. On Wednesday, August 13, Tate was [[Burial|interred]] in the [[Holy Cross Cemetery, Culver City|Holy Cross Cemetery]], [[Culver City, California]], with her son, Paul Richard Polanski (named posthumously for Polanski's and Tate's fathers), in her arms. Sebring's funeral took place later the same day; the funerals were scheduled several hours apart to allow mutual friends to attend.

''[[Life (magazine)|Life]]'' magazine devoted a lengthy article to the murders and featured photographs of the crime scenes. Polanski was interviewed for the article and allowed himself to be photographed at the entrance of the house, next to the front door with the word "PIG"—written in Tate's blood—still visible.&lt;ref&gt;''Life'' Magazine, August 29, 1969, pp. 42–48.&lt;/ref&gt; Widely criticized for his actions, he argued that he wanted to know who was responsible and was willing to shock the magazine's readers in the hope that someone would come forward with information.{{sfn|Polanski|1984|p=}}

Curiosity about the victims led to the re-release of Tate's films, achieving greater popularity than they had in their initial runs. Some newspapers began to speculate about the motives for the murders. Some of the published photographs of Tate were allegedly taken at a Satanic ritual, but were later proven to have been production photographs from ''Eye of the Devil''. Friends spoke out against the portrayal of Tate by some elements of the media. [[Mia Farrow]] said she was as "sweet and pure a human being as I have ever known", while [[Patty Duke]] remembered her as "a gentle, gentle creature. I was crazy about her, and I don't know anyone who wasn't." Polanski berated a crowd of journalists at a [[news conference]], saying that many times they had written that Tate "was beautiful. Maybe the most beautiful woman in the world. But did you ever write how good she was?"{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} Peter Evans later quoted the actor [[Laurence Harvey]], who commented on Polanski immediately after the murders, "This could destroy Roman. Marriage vows mean nothing to him, but few men have adored a woman as much as he adored Sharon."&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;

Polanski later stated that, in the months following the murders, he suspected various friends and associates, and his paranoia subsided only when the killers were arrested. Newspapers claimed that many Hollywood stars were moving out of the city, while others were reported to have installed security systems in their homes. Writer [[Dominick Dunne]] later recalled the tension:&lt;blockquote&gt;The shock waves that went through the town were beyond anything I had ever seen before. People were convinced that the rich and famous of the community were in peril. Children were sent out of town. Guards were hired. Steve McQueen packed a gun when he went to Jay Sebring's funeral.&lt;ref name="dominickdunne"&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Dominick Dunne |last=Dunne |first=Dominick |title=The Way We Lived Then: Recollections of a Well Known Name Dropper|year=1999|publisher=Crown Publishers|isbn=0-609-60388-4}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In September 1969, members of the Manson "Family" were arrested on [[Manson_Family#Investigation|unrelated charges]], eventually leading authorities to a breakthrough on the Tate case as well. They explained that the motive for the murders was not the identity of the victims, but rather the house at that address, which had previously been rented to record producer Terry Melcher, an acquaintance of Manson.

In 1994, the Tate-Polanski house was demolished and a new house was constructed on the site with the street address changed to 10066 Cielo Drive.&lt;ref name="LA Mag"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lamag.com/longform/manson-an-oral-history1/|title=Manson: An Oral History - Los Angeles Magazine|date=July 1, 2009|website=LAMag.com|access-date=January 28, 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Legacy ===
In the early 1980s, Stephen Kay, who had worked for the prosecution in the trial, became alarmed that Manson Family member [[Leslie Van Houten]] had gathered 900 signatures on a petition for her parole. He contacted Tate's mother, Doris, who said she was sure she could do better, and the two mounted a publicity campaign, collecting over 350,000 signatures supporting the denial of parole.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} Van Houten had been seen as the most likely of the killers to be paroled; following Kay's and Tate's efforts, her petition was denied. Doris Tate became a vocal advocate for victims' rights and, in discussing her daughter's murder and meeting other crime victims, assumed the role of counselor, using her profile to encourage public discussion and criticism of the corrections system.{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

For the rest of her life, she strongly campaigned against the parole of each of the Manson killers, and worked closely with other victims of violent crime. Several times, she confronted Charles Manson at parole hearings, explaining, "I feel that Sharon has to be represented in that hearing room. If they're (the killers) pleading for their lives, then I have to be there representing her." She addressed Tex Watson directly during her [[victim impact statement]] in 1984: "What mercy, sir, did you show my daughter when she was begging for her life? What mercy did you show my daughter when she said, 'Give me two weeks to have my baby and then you can kill me'? ... When will Sharon come up for parole? Will these seven victims and possibly more walk out of their graves if you get paroled? You cannot be trusted."{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

In 1992, President [[George H. W. Bush|George Bush]] recognized Doris Tate as one of his "thousand points of light" for her volunteer work on behalf of victims' rights. By this time Tate had been diagnosed with a malignant [[brain tumor]] and her health and strength were failing; her meeting with Bush marked her final public appearance. When she died later that year, her youngest daughter, Patricia Gay Tate, known as Patti, continued her work. She contributed to the 1993 foundation of the Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau, a nonprofit organization that aims to influence crime legislation throughout the United States and to give greater rights and protection to victims of violent crime.&lt;ref name="doristatebureau"&gt;[http://www.ican-foundation.org/ Doris Tate Crime Victims Bureau] Retrieved July 13, 2005.&lt;/ref&gt; In 1995, the Doris Tate Crime Victims Foundation was founded as a nonprofit organization to promote public awareness of the judicial system and to provide support to the victims of violent crime.&lt;ref name="doristatefoundation"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://doristate.com/foundation.htm |title=The Doris Tate Crime Victims Foundation |date=January 25, 2007 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070207235859/http://doristate.com/foundation.htm |archivedate=February 7, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Patti Tate confronted [[David Geffen]] and board members of [[Geffen Records]] in 1993 over plans to include a song written by Charles Manson on the [[Guns N' Roses]] album ''[["The Spaghetti Incident?"]]''. She commented to a journalist that the record company was "putting Manson up on a pedestal for young people who don't know who he is to worship like an idol."&lt;ref name="pattitate"&gt;{{cite news |first=Michael |last=Quintanilla |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1994-01-10/news/vw-10404_1_sharon-tate |title=Promises to Keep: Patti Tate Leads a Justice Crusade in the Name of Her Sister Sharon|newspaper=[[Los Angeles Times]]|date=January 10, 1994|access-date=July 13, 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After Patti's death from [[breast cancer]] in 2000, her older sister Debra continued to represent the Tate family at parole hearings. Debra Tate said of the killers: "They don't show any personal responsibility. They haven't made atonement to any one of my family members."{{sfn|King|2000|p=}} She has also unsuccessfully lobbied for her sister to be awarded a star on the [[Hollywood Walk of Fame]].

Colonel Paul Tate preferred not to make public comments; however, he was a constant presence during the murder trial, and in the following years attended parole hearings with his wife, and wrote letters to authorities in which he strongly opposed any suggestion of parole. He died in May 2005.&lt;ref name="paultate"&gt;{{cite news |date=May 24, 2005 |url=http://www.newcriminologist.co.uk/news.asp?id=1810338925 |work=New Criminologist |title=Obituary ...

Tate Family Legacy website. Retrieved September 27, 2009.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Roman Polanski]] gave away all of his possessions after the murders, unable to bear any reminders of the period that he called "the happiest I ever was in my life." He remained in Los Angeles until the killers were arrested. After, he fled to Europe to evade criminal charges of raping a 13-year-old girl. His 1979 film ''[[Tess (1979 film)|Tess]]'' was dedicated "to Sharon", as Tate had read [[Thomas Hardy]]'s ''[[Tess of the d'Urbervilles]]'' during her final stay with Polanski in London and had left it for him to read with the comment that it would be a good story for them to film together. He tried to explain his anguish after the murder of his wife and unborn son in his 1984 [[autobiography]] ''Roman by Polanski'', saying "Since Sharon's death, and despite appearances to the contrary, my enjoyment of life has been incomplete. In moments of unbearable personal tragedy some people find solace in religion. In my case the opposite happened. Any religious faith I had was shattered by Sharon's murder. It reinforced my faith in the absurd."{{sfn|Polanski|1984|p=}}

In July 2005, Polanski successfully sued ''[[Vanity Fair (magazine)|Vanity Fair]]'' magazine for [[Defamation|libel]] after it alleged that he had tried to seduce a woman on his way to Tate's funeral. Among the witnesses who testified on his behalf were Debra Tate and Mia Farrow. Describing Polanski immediately after Tate's death, Farrow testified, "Of this I can be sure—of his frame of mind when we were there, of what we talked about, of his utter sense of loss, of despair and bewilderment and shock and love—a love that he had lost." At the conclusion of the case, Polanski read a statement, saying in part, "The memory of my late wife Sharon Tate was at the forefront of my mind in bringing this action."&lt;ref name="times" /&gt;

The murders committed by the Manson "Family" have been described by social commentators as one of the defining moments of the 1960s. [[Joan Didion]] wrote, "Many people I know in Los Angeles believe that the Sixties ended abruptly on August 9, 1969, ended at the exact moment when word of the murders on Cielo Drive traveled like brushfire through the community, and in a sense this is true. The tension broke that day. The paranoia was fulfilled."{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

Tate's work as an actress has been reassessed after her death, with contemporary film writers and critics, such as [[Leonard Maltin]], describing her potential as a comedian. A restored version of ''The Fearless Vampire Killers'' more closely resembles Polanski's intention. Maltin lauded the film as "near-brilliant" and Tate's work in ''Don't Make Waves'' and ''The Wrecking Crew'' as her two best performances, as well as the best indicators of the career she might have established.&lt;ref name="leonardmaltin"&gt;{{cite book|authorlink=Leonard Maltin|last=Maltin|first=Leonard|title=Leonard Maltin's Movie and Video Guide|publisher=Signet Publishing|year=1998|isbn=0-451-19288-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Eye of the Devil'' with its supernatural themes, and ''Valley of the Dolls'', with its overstated melodrama, have each achieved a degree of [[cult film|cult status]].

Tate's [[biography|biographer]], [[Greg King (author)|Greg King]], holds a view often expressed by members of the Tate family, writing in ''Sharon Tate and the Manson Murders'' (2000): "Sharon's real legacy lies not in her movies or in her television work. The very fact that, today, victims or their families in California are able to sit before those convicted of a crime and have a voice in the sentencing at trials or at parole hearings, is largely due to the work of Doris [and Patti] Tate. Their years of devotion to Sharon's memory and dedication to victims' rights&amp;nbsp;... have helped transform Sharon from mere victim, [and] restore a human face to one of the twentieth century's most infamous crimes."{{sfn|King|2000|p=}}

In 2012, the book ''Restless Souls'' was published. Authored by Alisa Statman, a close friend of Patti Tate, two short chapters in the book are written by Sharon's niece, Brie Taylor Ford, daughter of the late Patti Tate Ford. The book contains portions of the unfinished autobiographies of Sharon's father, mother and sister, Patti, along with Statman's own "personal interpretation[s]." &lt;ref&gt;''Restless Souls'', Author Alisa Statman, Published 2012, Publisher [[HarperCollins|HarperCollins Publishers, LLC]]&lt;/ref&gt; Debra Tate has questioned the book's veracity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://sharontate.net/Debra_Tate_Official_Statement_Re_Alisa_Statman_Book_Restless_Souls_3_9_2012_long.html|title=Debra Tate Official Statement Re: Alisa Statman Book Restless Souls|publisher=|access-date=May 7, 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On June 10, 2014, a [[coffee table book]] by Debra Tate, called ''Sharon Tate: Recollection'', was released. It is the first book about Tate that is devoted exclusively to her life and career without covering her death, its aftermath, or the events that led to it.&lt;ref name=book&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.biography.com/news/sharon-tate-book-photos|title=Sharon Tate's Sister Remembers Her Beautiful Life (PHOTOS)|last=Tate|first=Debra|date=|website=|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Memorial art exhibition ===

{{Chinese name|[[Wan (surname)|Wan]]}}

'''Wan Yanhai''' ({{zh|c=万延海|p=Wàn Yánhǎi}}; born 20 November 1963) is a Chinese [[AIDS]] activist.  

Dr. Wan started his career at China's Ministry of Health (MOH), where among other things he translated the first announcement of the AIDS epidemic into Chinese. He set up the first HIV/AIDS telephone hotline in China where people could obtain comprehensive information on HIV/AIDS.

After this, he  focused much of his AIDS work on advocating for health care and human rights of people with AIDS living in Henan Province, where there was a coverup of blood selling businesses connected to local officials infected tens of thousands (as many as a million) men, women, and children with the AIDS virus. He expanded his work to advocate for the health of injection drug users, sex workers, and other marginalized groups disproportionately affected by the AIDS epidemic. He was co-founder of the [[Beijing LGBT Center]], the first gay community center in China.  His "frank and aggressive" approach toward AIDS has led to frequent run-ins with authorities and landed him in detention three times in the past 12 years, including a month-long detention in 2002 that made international headlines and sparked a successful international campaign for his release.&lt;ref name="hrn2002"&gt;{{cite press release|url=http://hrw.org/english/docs/2002/09/20/china4300.htm|title=Detained AIDS Activist Wan Yanhai Released|date=20 September 2002|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

Dr. Wan has won numerous human rights awards, is a former Fulbright Fellow and Yale University Global Fellow, and signed China's groundbreaking Charter 08 on human rights, of which Nobel Laureate and Wan's friend Liu Xiaobo is the first signatory. Dr. Wan is currently the director of the country's foremost AIDS-awareness group, the Beijing-based [[Aizhixing Institute of Health Education]]. (The Chinese characters for "Aizhixing" (愛知行)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aizhi.org/|title=Aizhixing}}&lt;/ref&gt;  represent love, knowledge and action and are a play on the Chinese word for AIDS.) 

On 24 August 2002 he disappeared and was later found to be detained by police after attending a film screening at a [[Beijing]] gay and lesbian film festival and charged with the leaking of an internal government report into the [[HIV/AIDS in the People's Republic of China#Bloodhead controversy|Bloodhead scandal]] in [[Henan Province]].&lt;ref name="bloodheadtk"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.hrichina.org/public/contents/article?revision%5fid=1888&amp;item%5fid=1887|publisher=Human Rights in China|date=23 February 2003|title=Health officials seek to avoid responsibility for the spread of HIV/AIDS in rural Henan|first=Tom|last=Kellogg|accessdate=2007-01-29}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was released a month later on 20 September.&lt;ref name="hrn2002"/&gt;

From 6 to 9 November 2006, he attended an international meeting in Indonesia for [[The Yogyakarta Principles]] as one of 29 experts. After the meeting he has gotten his most recent detention on November 24, 2006 - this time a three-day detention prompted by his efforts to organize a public forum on HIV/AIDS to coincide with [[World AIDS Day]]. After his release on November 27, 2006, Wan accused Chinese leaders of falling "asleep" as the virus spreads. He was also forced by the government to cancel his "Blood Safety, AIDS and Legal Human Rights Workshop" (due to have taken place between 25–30 November 2006).

As the [[Charter 08]] by [[Liu Xiaobo]] was published on 10 December 2008, he agreed it and became one of the signatories. In July 2009, he also participated the [[2009 World Outgames]] for [[LGBT rights]].

On May 10, 2010, Wan Yanhai together with his family fled to the United States of America because of what he considered to be government persecution. In March, tax authorities opened an investigation into the Aizhixing Institute of Health Education.&lt;ref name="washpost2010"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-dyn/content/article/2010/05/10/AR2010051004801_pf.html|publisher=''Washington Post''|date=11 May 2010|title=China's crackdown on nonprofit groups prompts new fears among activists|first=Keith B.|last=Richburg|page=A09|accessdate=2010-05-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; 

However, in 2011 tax authorities admitted that they had made an error and returned some 8,000 RMB to Aizhixing Institute.
