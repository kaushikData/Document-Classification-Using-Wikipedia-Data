{{BC year in topic|675}}

The year '''675 BC''' was a year of the [[Roman calendar|pre-Julian Roman calendar]]. In the [[Roman Empire]], it was known as '''year 79 ''[[Ab urbe condita]]'' '''. The denomination 675 BC for this year has been used since the early medieval period, when the [[Anno Domini]] [[calendar era]] became the prevalent method in Europe for naming years.

'''Andrei Dmitrievich Sakharov''' ({{lang-ru|Андре́й Дми́триевич Са́харов|p=ɐnˈdrʲej dmʲiˈtrʲɪjevʲɪtɕ ˈsaxərəf}}; 21 May 1921{{spaced ndash}}14 December 1989) was a Russian [[nuclear physicist]], [[Soviet dissident|dissident]], and activist for [[Nuclear disarmament|disarmament]], peace and human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Sakharov Human Rights Prize 25th anniversary marked in US|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/anniversary-of-andrei-sakharov-human-rights-prize/1830297.html|publisher=[[Voice of America]]|date=15 January 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He became renowned as the designer of the [[Soviet Union]]'s [[RDS-37]], a codename for Soviet development of [[Teller–Ulam design|thermonuclear weapons]]. Sakharov later became an advocate of [[civil liberties]] and civil reforms in the Soviet Union, for which he faced state persecution; these efforts earned him the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] in 1975. The [[Sakharov Prize]], which is awarded annually by the [[European Parliament]] for people and organizations dedicated to human rights and freedoms, is named in his honor.&lt;ref name="aip.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/history/sakharov/|title=Andrei Sakharov: Soviet Physics, Nuclear Weapons and Human Rights|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Biography ==
Sakharov was born in [[Moscow]] on May 21, 1921. His father was Dmitri Ivanovich Sakharov, a private school physics teacher and an amateur [[pianist]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1975/sakharov-autobio.html|title=Andrei Sakharov – Biographical|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; His father later taught at the [[Second Moscow State University]].&lt;ref&gt;Sidney David Drell, Sergeǐ Petrovich Kapitsa, ''Sakharov Remembered: a tribute by friends and colleagues'' (1991), p. 4&lt;/ref&gt; Andrei's grandfather Ivan had been a prominent lawyer in the [[Russian Empire]] who had displayed respect for social awareness and humanitarian principles (including advocating the abolition of [[Capital punishment in Russia|capital punishment]]) that would later influence his grandson. Sakharov's mother was Yekaterina Alekseyevna Sakharova, a great-granddaughter of the prominent military commander Alexey Semenovich Sofiano (who was of Greek ancestry).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sakharov-center.ru/sakharov/ |script-title=ru:Об А.Д. Сахарове |last=Bonner |first=Yelena |language=Russian |accessdate=November 2, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uKder44e?url=http://www.sakharov-center.ru/sakharov/ |archivedate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=yes |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.memorial.krsk.ru/Articles/Djuha.htm |script-title=ru:Греки в Красноярском крае (Материалы из книги И.Джухи "Греческая операция НКВД") |language=Russian |accessdate=November 2, 2009 |archiveurl=https://www.webcitation.org/5uKdgkFB9?url=http://www.memorial.krsk.ru/Articles/Djuha.htm |archivedate=November 18, 2010 |deadurl=no |df=mdy }}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakharov's parents and paternal grandmother, Maria Petrovna, largely shaped his personality. His mother and grandmother were churchgoers; his father was a nonbeliever. When Andrei  was about thirteen, he realized that he did not believe, but in later life he unequivocally described his religious feeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | title=The World of Andrei Sakharov: A Russian Physicist's Path to Freedom | publisher=Oxford University Press | author=Gorelik, Gennady |author2=Antonina W. Bouis | year=2005 | page=356 | isbn=978-0-19-515620-1 | quote="I cannot imagine the Universe and human life without some origin of meaning, without a source of spiritual "warmth," lying outside matter and its laws".}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Education and career===
Sakharov entered [[Moscow State University]] in 1938. Following evacuation in 1941 during the [[Eastern Front (World War II)|Great Patriotic War]] (World War II), he graduated in [[Aşgabat]], in today's [[Turkmenistan]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.msu.ru/en/info/nobel.html|title=Nobel Prize Laureates from MSU|website=Moscow State University|language=en|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was then assigned to laboratory work in [[Ulyanovsk]]. In 1943, he married Klavdia Alekseyevna Vikhireva, with whom he raised two daughters and a son. Klavdia would later die in 1969. He returned to Moscow in 1945 to study at the Theoretical Department of [[Lebedev Physical Institute|FIAN]] (the Physical Institute of the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|Soviet Academy of Sciences]]). He received his [[Doctor of Philosophy|Ph.D.]] in 1947.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.physicsoftheuniverse.com/scientists_sakharov.html|title=Andrei Sakharov - Important Scientists|last=Mastin|first=Luke|date=2009|website=The Physics of the Universe|access-date=2017-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Development of thermonuclear devices===
{{main|RDS-37|Tsar Bomba}}
After [[World War II]], he researched [[cosmic ray]]s. In mid-1948 he participated in the [[Soviet atomic bomb project]] under [[Igor Kurchatov]] and [[Igor Tamm]]. Sakharov's study group at FIAN in 1948 came up with a second concept in August–September 1948.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;Zaloga, Steve (17 February 2002). ''The Kremlin's Nuclear Sword: The Rise and Fall of Russia's Strategic Nuclear Forces 1945–2000''. Smithsonian Books. {{ISBN|1588340074}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Adding a shell of natural, unenriched uranium around the deuterium would increase the deuterium concentration at the uranium-deuterium boundary and the overall yield of the device, because the natural uranium would capture neutrons and itself fission as part of the thermonuclear reaction. This idea of a layered fission-fusion-fission bomb led Sakharov to call it the sloika, or layered cake.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; The first Soviet atomic device was tested on August 29, 1949. After moving to [[Sarov]] in 1950, Sakharov played a key role in the development of the first megaton-range Soviet hydrogen bomb using a design known as ''Sakharov's Third Idea'' in Russia and the [[History of the Teller–Ulam design|Teller–Ulam design]] in the United States. Before his ''Third Idea'', Sakharov tried a "layer cake" of alternating layers of fission and fusion fuel. The results were disappointing, yielding no more than a typical fission bomb. However the design was seen to be worth pursuing because deuterium is abundant and uranium is scarce, and he had no idea how powerful the US design was. Sakharov realised that in order to cause the explosion of one side of the fuel to symmetrically compress the fusion fuel, a mirror could be used to reflect the radiation. The details had not been officially declassified in Russia when Sakharov was writing his memoirs, but in the Teller–Ulam design, soft X-rays emitted by the fission bomb were focused onto a cylinder of lithium deuteride to compress it symmetrically. This is called [[radiation implosion]]. The Teller–Ulam design also had a secondary fission device inside the fusion cylinder to assist with the compression of the fusion fuel and generate neutrons to convert some of the lithium to tritium, producing a mixture of deuterium and tritium.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Sakharov, Andrei|title=Memoirs|publisher=Vintage|date=1992|isbn=067973595X}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Gorelik, Gennady |author2=Bouis, Antonina |title=The world of Andrei Sakharov: a Russian physicist's path to freedom|date=2005|publisher=Oxford University Press|isbn=019515620X}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakharov's idea was first tested as [[RDS-37]] in 1955. A larger variation of the same design which Sakharov worked on was the 50&amp;nbsp;Mt [[Tsar Bomba]] of October 1961, which was the most powerful nuclear device ever detonated.

Sakharov saw "striking parallels" between his fate and those of [[J. Robert Oppenheimer]] and [[Edward Teller]] in the US. Sakharov believed that in this "tragic confrontation of two outstanding people", both deserved respect, because "each of them was certain he had right on his side and was morally obligated to go to the end in the name of truth." While Sakharov strongly disagreed with Teller over [[Nuclear weapons testing|nuclear testing in the atmosphere]] and the [[Strategic Defense Initiative]], he believed that American academics had been unfair to Teller's resolve to get the H-bomb for the United States since "all steps by the Americans of a temporary or permanent rejection of developing thermonuclear weapons would have been seen either as a clever feint, or as the manifestation of stupidity. In both cases, the reaction would have been the same – avoid the trap and immediately take advantage of the enemy's stupidity."

Sakharov never felt that by creating nuclear weapons he had "known sin", in Oppenheimer's expression. He later wrote:
{{quote|text=After more than forty years, we have had no [[third world war]], and the [[Mutual assured destruction|balance of nuclear terror]]&amp;nbsp;... may have helped to prevent one. But I am not at all sure of this; back then, in those long-gone years, the question didn't even arise. What most troubles me now is the instability of the balance, the extreme peril of the current situation, the appalling waste of the arms race&amp;nbsp;... Each of us has a responsibility to think about this in global terms, with tolerance, trust, and candor, free from ideological dogmatism, parochial interests, or national egotism."|source=Andrei Sakharov&lt;ref name="people"&gt;{{cite encyclopedia|url=http://people.bu.edu/gorelik/AIP_Sakharov_Photo_Chrono/SakharovAndrei_NDSB_uned.htm|title=Andrei Sakharov||first=Gennady|last=Gorelik|encyclopedia=New dictionary of scientific biography|date=2008|editor-first=Noretta|editor-last=Koertge|publisher=Charles Scribner's Sons/Thomson Gale|location=Detroit}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Support for peaceful use of nuclear technology===
{{main|Tokamak}}
In 1950 he proposed an idea for a controlled [[nuclear fusion]] reactor, the [[tokamak]], which is still the basis for the majority of work in the area. Sakharov, in association with Tamm, proposed confining extremely hot ionized [[Plasma (physics)|plasma]] by [[torus]] shaped [[magnetic field]]s for controlling [[thermonuclear fusion]] that led to the development of the tokamak device.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.aip.org/history/sakharov/hbomb.htm|title=Andrei Sakharov: Soviet Physics, Nuclear Weapons and Human Rights|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;/ref&gt; compressing magnetic fields by [[Explosive material|explosives]]. He called these devices MK (for ''MagnetoKumulative'') generators. The radial MK-1 produced a pulsed magnetic field of 25 [[gauss (unit)|megagauss]] (2500 [[tesla (unit)|teslas]]). The resulting helical MK-2 generated 1000 million amperes in 1953.

Sakharov then tested a MK-driven "plasma cannon" where a small aluminum ring was vaporized by huge [[eddy current]]s into a stable, self-confined [[torus|toroidal]] [[plasmoid]] and was accelerated to 100&amp;nbsp;km/s.&lt;ref name="Sakharov book" /&gt; Sakharov later suggested replacing the copper [[Electromagnetic coil|coil]] in MK generators with a large [[Superconductivity|superconductor]] [[solenoid]] to magnetically compress and focus [[Nuclear testing|underground nuclear explosions]] into a [[shaped charge]] effect. He theorized this could focus 10&lt;sup&gt;23&lt;/sup&gt; [[proton]]s per second on a 1&amp;nbsp;mm&lt;sup&gt;2&lt;/sup&gt; surface.

===Particle physics and cosmology===
After 1965 Sakharov returned to [[fundamental science]] and began working on [[particle physics]] and [[physical cosmology]].&lt;ref name="Sakharov 1966"&gt;{{cite journal

He mainly tried to explain the [[baryon asymmetry]] of the universe; in that regard, he was the first to propose [[proton decay]] and to consider [[CPT symmetry|CPT-symmetric]] events occurring ''before'' the [[Big Bang]]:

Sakharov was the first scientist to introduce twin universes he called "sheets". He achieved a complete CPT symmetry since the second sheet is populated by invisible "shadow matter" which is [[antimatter]] ([[C-symmetry]]) because of an opposite [[CP-violation]] there, and the two sheets are [[Chirality (mathematics)|mirror of each other]] both in space ([[parity inversion|P-symmetry]]) and time ([[T-symmetry]]) through the same initial [[gravitational singularity]].

In his first model the two universes did not interact, except via local matter accumulation whose density and pressure become high enough to connect the two sheets through a bridge without [[spacetime]] between them, but with a continuity of [[geodesic]]s beyond the [[Schwarzschild radius]] with no singularity, allowing an exchange of matter between the two conjugated sheets, based on an idea after [[Igor Dmitriyevich Novikov]].&lt;ref name="Novikov 1966"&gt;{{cite journal

Sakharov also proposed the idea of [[induced gravity]] as an alternative theory of [[quantum gravity]].&lt;ref name="Sakharov QVF"&gt;

===Turn to activism===
Since the late 1950s Sakharov had become concerned about the moral and political implications of his work. Politically active during the 1960s, Sakharov was against [[nuclear proliferation]]. Pushing for the end of atmospheric tests, he played a role in the 1963 [[Partial Test Ban Treaty]], signed in Moscow.

Sakharov was also involved in an event with political consequences in 1964, when the USSR Academy of Sciences nominated for full membership Nikolai Nuzhdin, a follower of [[Trofim Lysenko]] (initiator of the Stalin-supported anti-genetics campaign [[Lysenkoism]]). Contrary to normal practice Sakharov, a member of the Academy, publicly spoke out against full membership for Nuzhdin, holding him responsible for "the defamation, firing, arrest, even death, of many genuine scientists."&lt;ref name=":2"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Brezhnev and the Decline of the Soviet Union|last=Crump|first=Thomas|date=2013|publisher=Routledge|isbn=978-1-134-66922-6|series=Routledge Studies in the History of Russia and Eastern Europe}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|109}} In the end, Nuzhdin was not elected, but the episode prompted Sergei Khrushchev to order the KGB to gather compromising material on Sakharov.&lt;ref name=":2" /&gt;{{Rp|109}}

The major turn in Sakharov's political evolution came in 1967, when [[anti-ballistic missile]] defense became a key issue in US–Soviet relations. In a secret detailed letter to the Soviet leadership of July 21, 1967, Sakharov explained the need to "take the Americans at their word" and accept their proposal for a "bilateral rejection by the USA and the Soviet Union of the development of antiballistic missile defense", because otherwise an arms race in this new technology would increase the likelihood of nuclear war. He also asked permission to publish his manuscript (which accompanied the letter) in a newspaper to explain the dangers posed by this kind of defense. The government ignored his letter and refused to let him initiate a public discussion of ABMs in the Soviet press.&lt;ref&gt;Gennady Gorelik. The Metamorphosis of Andrei Sakharov. Scientific American, 1999, March.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Web exhibit "Andrei SAKHAROV: Soviet Physics, Nuclear Weapons, and Human Rights" at American Institute of Physics [http://www.aip.org/history/sakharov/]&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1968 Sakharov completed an essay entitled "Reflections on Progress, Peaceful Coexistence, and Intellectual Freedom". In it, he described the anti-ballistic missile defense as a major threat of world nuclear war. After this essay was circulated in ''[[samizdat]]'' and then published outside the Soviet Union,&lt;ref&gt;Initially on July 6, 1968, in the Dutch newspaper ''[[Het Parool]]'' through intermediary of the Dutch academic and writer [[Karel van het Reve]], followed by ''[[The New York Times]]'': {{cite news|title=Outspoken Soviet Scientist; Andrei Dmitriyevich Sakharov|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1968/07/22/archives/outspoken-soviet-scientist-andrei-dmitriyevich-sakharov.html|newspaper=New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sakharov was banned from conducting any military-related research and returned to FIAN to study fundamental theoretical physics.

Over the next twelve years, until his exile to Gorky ([[Nizhny Novgorod]]) in January 1980, Andrei Sakharov assumed the role of a widely recognized and open dissident in Moscow.&lt;ref name=":1"&gt;{{Cite book|title=The KGB File of Andrei Sakharov|date=2005|others=Joshua Rubenstein, Alexander Gribanov (eds.), Ella Shmulevich, Efrem Yankelevich, Alla Zeide (trans.)|isbn=0-300-12937-8|location=New Haven, CN}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{Rp|21}} He stood vigil outside closed courtrooms, wrote appeals on behalf of more than two hundred individual prisoners, and continued to write essays about the need for democratization.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|21}}

In 1970 Sakharov was among the three founding members of the [[Committee on Human Rights in the USSR]] along with [[Valery Chalidze]] and [[Andrei Tverdokhlebov]].&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|21}} The Committee wrote appeals, collected signatures for petitions and succeeded in affiliating with several international human rights organizations. Its work was the subject of many KGB reports and brought Sakharov under increasing pressure from the government.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA" /&gt;

Sakharvov married a fellow human rights activist, [[Yelena Bonner]], in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.irishtimes.com/news/activist-yelena-bonner-dies-at-88-1.878503 ''irishtimes.com'']&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1973 Sakharov was meeting regularly with Western correspondents, holding press conferences in his apartment.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|21}} He appealed to the U.S. Congress to approve the 1974 [[Jackson–Vanik amendment|Jackson-Vanik Amendment]] to a trade bill, which coupled trade tariffs to the Kremlin's willingness to allow freer emigration.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|24}}

===Attacked by Soviet establishment, 1972 onwards===

[[File:Meiman dissidents.gif|thumb|239x239px|Sakharov with [[Naum Meiman]], [[Sofiya Kallistratova]], [[Petro Grigorenko]], his wife Zinaida Grigorenko, [[Tatyana Velikanova]]'s mother, the priest Father Sergei Zheludkov; in the lower row are Genrikh Altunyan and [[Alexander Podrabinek]]. Photo taken on 16 October 1977.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Подрабинек, Александр|title=Диссиденты|trans-title=Dissidents|date=2014|publisher=АСТ|location=Moscow|isbn=978-5-17-082401-4|language=Russian}}&lt;/ref&gt;]]In 1972 Sakharov became the target of sustained pressure from his fellow scientists in the [[Russian Academy of Sciences|USSR Academy of Sciences]], the Soviet press. The writer [[Aleksandr Solzhenitsyn]], sprang to his defence.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chronicle6883.wordpress.com/2016/01/16/30-12-materials-about-sakharov/|title=30.12 Materials about Sakharov|work=A Chronicle of Current Events}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1973 and 1974, the Soviet media campaign continued, targeting both Sakharov and Solzhenitsyn. While Sakharov disagreed with Solzhenitsyn's vision of Russian revival, he deeply respected him for his courage.

Sakharov later described that it took "years" for him to "understand how much substitution, deceit, and lack of correspondence with reality there was" in the Soviet ideals. "At first I thought, despite everything that I saw with my own eyes, that the Soviet State was a breakthrough into the future, a kind of prototype for all countries". Then he came, in his words, to "the theory of symmetry: all governments and regimes to a first approximation are bad, all peoples are oppressed, and all are threatened by common dangers."&lt;ref name="people" /&gt;

After that he realized that there is not much 
{{quote
 |text="symmetry between a cancer cell and a normal one. Yet our state is similar to a cancer cell – with its messianism and expansionism, its totalitarian suppression of dissent, the authoritarian structure of power, with a total absence of public control in the most important decisions in domestic and foreign policy, a closed society that does not inform its citizens of anything substantial, closed to the outside world, without freedom of travel or the exchange of information." &lt;ref name="people" /&gt;}} 
Sakharov's ideas on social development led him to put forward the principle of human rights as a new basis of all politics. In his works he declared that "the principle '[[Everything which is not forbidden is allowed|what is not prohibited is allowed]]' should be understood literally", defying what he saw as unwritten ideological rules imposed by the Communist party on the society in spite of a democratic (1936) [[USSR Constitution]].

In no way did Sakharov consider himself a prophet or the like: 
{{quote
|text="I am no volunteer priest of the idea, but simply a man with an unusual fate. I am against all kinds of self-immolation (for myself and for others, including the people closest to me)."&lt;ref name="people" /&gt; }}

In a letter written from exile, he cheered up a fellow physicist and human rights activist with the words: "Fortunately, the future is unpredictable and also – because of [[quantum effects]] – uncertain." For Sakharov the indeterminacy of the future supported his belief that he could, and should, take personal responsibility for it.

=== Nobel Peace Prize (1975) ===
In 1973, Sakharov was nominated for the [[Nobel Peace Prize]] and in 1974 was awarded the [[Prix mondial Cino Del Duca]].

Sakharov was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize in 1975. The [[Norwegian Nobel Committee]] called him "a spokesman for the conscience of mankind".&lt;ref name="aip.org" /&gt; In the words of the Nobel Committee's citation: "In a convincing manner Sakharov has emphasised that Man's inviolable rights provide the only safe foundation for genuine and enduring international cooperation."&lt;ref name="people" /&gt;

Sakharov was not allowed to leave the Soviet Union to collect the prize. His wife [[Yelena Bonner]] read his speech at the ceremony in [[Oslo]], Norway.&lt;ref name="nobel_acceptance_speech"&gt;Y.B. Sakharov: [http://nobelprize.org/nobel_prizes/peace/laureates/1975/sakharov-acceptance.html Acceptance Speech], Nobel Peace Prize, Oslo, Norway, December 10, 1975.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="nobel_lecture2"&gt;Y.B.

He included a list of prisoners of conscience and political prisoners in the USSR, stating that he shares the prize with them.&lt;ref name="nobel_lecture2"/&gt;

By 1976 the head of the KGB [[Yuri Andropov]] was prepared to call Sakharov "Domestic Enemy Number One" before a group of KGB officers.&lt;ref name=":1" /&gt;{{Rp|24}}

===Internal exile (1980–1986)===
[[File:C0474-NN-Sakharov-house.jpg|thumb|upright|The apartment building in the Scherbinki district of Nizhny Novgorod where Sakharov lived in exile from 1980 to 1986. His apartment is now a museum.]]
Sakharov was arrested on 22 January 1980, following his public protests against the [[Soviet intervention in Afghanistan]] in 1979, and was sent to the city of Gorky, now [[Nizhny Novgorod]], a city that was off limits to foreigners. {{citation needed|date=September 2018}}

Between 1980 and 1986, Sakharov was kept under Soviet police surveillance. In his memoirs he mentions that their apartment in Gorky was repeatedly subjected to searches and heists. Sakharov was named the 1980 Humanist of the Year by the [[American Humanist Association]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Humanist of the Year |url=http://www.americanhumanist.org/AHA/Humanists_of_the_Year |accessdate=21 November 2012 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130114082408/http://www.americanhumanist.org/AHA/Humanists_of_the_Year |archivedate=January 14, 2013 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In May 1984, Sakharov's wife, [[Yelena Bonner]], was detained and Sakharov began a [[hunger strike]], demanding permission for his wife to travel to the United States for heart surgery. He was forcibly hospitalized and [[forced feeding|force-fed]]. He was held in isolation for four months. In August 1984 Bonner was sentenced by a court to five years of exile in Gorky.

In April 1985, Sakharov started a new hunger strike for his wife to travel abroad for medical treatment. He again was taken to a hospital and force-fed. In August the Politburo discussed what to do about Sakharov.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bukovskyarchive.wordpress.com/2016/07/03/29-august-1985-no-number-pb/ The Bukovsky Archives, 29 August 1985.]&lt;/ref&gt; He remained in the hospital until October 1985 when his wife was allowed to travel to the United States. She had heart surgery in the United States and returned to Gorky in June 1986.

In December 1985, the [[European Parliament]] established the [[Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought]], to be given annually for outstanding contributions to human rights.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://people.bu.edu/gorelik/AIP_Sakharov_Photo_Chrono/AIP_Sakharov_Photo_Chronology.html|title=AIP_Sakharov_Photo_Chronology|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 19 December 1986, [[Mikhail Gorbachev]], who had initiated the policies of [[perestroika]] and [[glasnost]], called Sakharov to tell him that he and his wife could return to Moscow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title=Perestroïka and Soviet national security |author=[[Michael MccGwire]] |publisher=Brookings Institution Press |year=1991 |isbn=0-8157-5553-8 |page=275 |url=https://books.google.com/?id=zbA2dK9GQb8C&amp;pg=PA275&amp;dq=andrei+sakharov+december+19#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political leader===
In 1988, Sakharov was given the International Humanist Award by the [[International Humanist and Ethical Union]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://iheu.org/about/iheu-awards/|title=IHEU Awards {{!}} IHEU|work=IHEU|access-date=2018-12-02|language=en-US}}&lt;/ref&gt; He helped to initiate the first independent legal political organizations and became prominent in the Soviet Union's growing political opposition. In March 1989, Sakharov [[Soviet Union legislative election, 1989|was elected]] to the new parliament, the [[Congress of People's Deputies of the Soviet Union|All-Union Congress of People's Deputies]] and co-led the democratic opposition, the [[Inter-Regional Deputies Group]]. In November the head of the KGB reported to Mikhail Gorbachev on Sakharov's encouragement and support for the coal-miners' strike in Vorkuta.&lt;ref&gt;[https://bukovskyarchive.wordpress.com/2016/07/06/14-november-1989-2292-kov/ The Bukovsky Archives, 14 November 1989.]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Death===
[[File:People gathered at the grave of Andrei Sakharov, 1990.jpg|thumb|right|Sakharov's grave, 1990]]
Soon after 21:00 on 14 December 1989, Sakharov went to his study to take a nap before preparing an important speech he was to deliver the next day in the Congress. His wife went to wake him at 23:00 as he had requested but she found Sakharov dead on the floor. According to the notes of Yakov Rapoport, a senior pathologist present at the autopsy, it is most likely that Sakharov died of an [[Heart arrhythmia|arrhythmia]] consequent to [[dilated cardiomyopathy]] at the age of 68.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Coleman |first=Fred |title=The Decline and Fall of the Soviet Empire: Forty Years That Shook the World, from Stalin to Yeltsin |page=116 |location=New York |publisher=St. Martin's |year=1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; He was interred in the Vostryakovskoye Cemetery in Moscow.

== Influence ==

=== Memorial prizes ===
The [[Sakharov Prize|Sakharov Prize for Freedom of Thought]] was established in 1988 by the [[European Parliament]] in his honour, and is the highest tribute to human rights endeavours awarded by the European Union. It is awarded annually by the parliament to "those who carry the spirit of Soviet dissident Andrei Sakharov"; to "Laureates who, like Sakharov, dedicate their lives to peaceful struggle for human rights."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

 | accessdate =10 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

An [[Andrei Sakharov Prize (APS)|Andrei Sakharov prize]] has also been awarded by the [[American Physical Society]] every second year since 2006 "to recognize outstanding leadership and/or achievements of scientists in upholding human rights".

The [[Andrei Sakharov Prize For Writer's Civic Courage]] was established in October 1990.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.chukfamily.ru/Lidia/Biblio/Rasskazova.htm "For Writer's Civic Courage"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080526141526/http://www.chukfamily.ru/Lidia/Biblio/Rasskazova.htm |date=May 26, 2008 }}, ''[[Literaturnaya Gazeta]]'', October 31, 1990&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2004, with the approval of [[Elena Bonner]], an annual Sakharov Prize for journalism was established for reporters and commentators in Russia. Funded by former Soviet dissident Pyotr Vins,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://chronicle6883.wordpress.com/no-49-14-may-1978/|title=No 49 : 14 May 1978|work=A Chronicle of Current Events}}&lt;/ref&gt; now a businessman in the USA, the prize is administered by the [[Glasnost Defence Foundation]] in Moscow. The prize "for journalism as an act of conscience" has been won over the years by famous journalists such as [[Anna Politkovskaya]] and young reporters and editors working far from Russia's media capital, Moscow. The 2015 winner was Yelena Kostyuchenko.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gdf.ru/digest/item/1/1334#ev1|title=Glasnost defence foundation digest No. 734|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Andrei Sakharov Archives and Human Rights Center ===
The [http://www.sakharov-archive.ru/English Andrei Sakharov Archives] and Human Rights Center, established at [[Brandeis University]] in 1993, are now housed at [[Harvard University]].&lt;ref name="Arc"&gt;[http://www.brandeis.edu/departments/sakharov/ Harvard University.

The documents from that archive were published by the [[Yale University Press]] in 2005.&lt;ref name="SakharovBook"&gt;The KGB File of Andrei Sakharov. (edited by Joshua Rubenstein and Alexander Gribanov), New Haven: Yale University Press, 2005; {{ISBN|978-0-300-10681-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; These documents are available online.&lt;ref name="bookonline"&gt;[http://www.yale.edu/annals/sakharov/sakharov_list.htm The KGB File of Andrei Sakharov] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070521130856/http://www.yale.edu/annals/sakharov/sakharov_list.htm |date=May 21, 2007 }}, online version with original texts and the English translations in English and in Russian (text version in [[Windows-1251]] [[character encoding]] and the pictures of the original pages).&lt;/ref&gt;
Most of documents of the archive are letters from the head of the [[KGB]] to the [[Central Committee]] about activities of Soviet dissidents and recommendations about the interpretation in newspapers. The letters cover the period from 1968 to 1991 ([[Brezhnev stagnation]]). The documents characterize not only Sakharov's activity, but that of other dissidents, as well as that of highest-position [[apparatchik]]s and the KGB. No Russian equivalent of the KGB archive is available.

The '''Apollo 20 ''' hoax is a [[wikt:faux|faux]] story told in a series of [[YouTube]] videos about an American, manned, lunar mission that discovered evidence of an extraterrestrial civilization on the [[Far side of the Moon|far side of the moon]].

==Hoax==
In April 2007, videos began appearing on YouTube under the username "retiredafb" telling the extraordinary story of Apollo 20, a secret lunar mission that definitively proved the existence of intelligent, alien life on the moon.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/user/retiredafb|title=retiredafb|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Then, on May 23, 2007, Italian ufologist Luca Scantanburlo interviewed a man who identified himself as William Rutledge, a retired American astronaut living in [[Rwanda]]. Rutledge claimed to be the commander of the Apollo 20 crew and to be the owner of the "retiredafb" account. However, Scantanburlo never met Rutledge in person because he conducted the interview over [[Yahoo! Messenger]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.angelismarriti.it/ANGELISMARRITI-ENG/REPORTS_ARTICLES/Apollo20-InterviewWithWilliamRutledge.htm|title=An Alien Spaceship on the Moon: Interview With William Rutledge, member of the Apollo 20 Crew - by Luca Scantamburlo, May 2007|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:American-soviet-flag.png|thumb|240px|Reconstruction of the American-Soviet flag as seen in the videos.]]

During the interview, Rutledge claimed Apollo 20 was a top-secret mission launched in mid-August 1976 from [[Vandenberg Air Force Base]] in [[Santa Barbara, California]], conducted jointly by the [[United States]] and the former [[Soviet Union]]. He alleged the other mission members were American Leona Snyder (an apparently fictitious person) and former Soviet cosmonaut [[Aleksei Leonov]], the first human being to walk in space. The purported landing site of the mission was near [[Guyot (crater)|Guyot crater]], a feature near the much larger [[Delporte (crater)|Delporte crater]]. Rutledge said the videos show that he and Leonov discovered the remains of an ancient lunar civilization.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Y3X5oucqQe4|title=Re: APOLLO 20 ALIEN SPACESHIP ON THE MOON  CSM FLYOVER 8|date=28 July 2007|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pXQu34KdYbg|title=Re: APOLLO 20 ALIEN SPACESHIP ON THE MOON  CSM FLYOVER 2|date=8 July 2007|publisher=|via=YouTube}}&lt;/ref&gt; He also said they brought back artifacts to earth for study, including a hibernating, female humanoid.

==YouTube videos==
The first Apollo 20 videos appeared on YouTube on [[April Fool's Day]], a hint that the story was nothing more than an elaborate prank. The videos, however, were then moved to Revver.com (another defunct website) also under user name retiredafb. Other videos are scattered throughout YouTube posted by several different account users, making it difficult to determine the true identity of the hoaxer. Each video continues to draw thousands of views.

Despite the realistic appearance of the videos, amateurs have easily debunked them on YouTube and elsewhere on the Internet.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite av media|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIEo1MmlCzI |title=Apollo 20 moon spacecraft Mona Lisa hoax debunked |date=13 August 2014 |publisher= |via=YouTube |last= |first= |language= |type= |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150524152420/https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zIEo1MmlCzI |archivedate=24 May 2015 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The videos are short, each only lasting a few minutes. If viewed in their intended sequence, they tell a partial story of the faux mission, starting with astronauts boarding Apollo 20 and ending with the extraordinary "discoveries" on the moon. They include the following images:

==Perpetrators==
''[[International Business Times]]'' writer Mary-Ann Russon has suggested the self-confessed perpetrator of the hoax is French videographer/artist Thierry Speth.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/world-ufo-day-alien-girl-secret-apollo-20-mission-1454928|title=World UFO Day: Alien Girl and the Secret Apollo 20 Mission|author=Mary-Ann Russon|work=International Business Times UK}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the website with Speth's admission, Need2know.eu, no longer exists nor does Speth's personal website. Also, more videos associated with other accounts have appeared on YouTube about Apollo 20, suggesting that more than one person is keeping the hoax alive.

==Truth behind the hoax==

[[File:Guyot Crater anomaly.jpg|thumb|right|240px|View of Guyot's crater wall running diagonally through the center of this [[Apollo 16]] photo taken in April 1972 while in lunar orbit. Some UFO enthusiasts believe the crater wall shows evidence of an alien spacecraft.]]

Like many hoaxes, this story is a mixture of facts and fiction. The starting point for it are photos that [[NASA]] astronauts took in 1971 while in lunar orbit during the [[Apollo 15]] mission, the fourth American mission that landed men on the moon. The photos show what look like a cigar-shaped object resting in a lunar crater. The hoaxer apparently used these photos to create the image of a pock-marked alien spacecraft on the moon. The NASA photos are real.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lpi.usra.edu/resources/apollo/frame/?AS15-P-9625|title=Apollo Image Atlas|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, NASA never claimed they include images of alien spacecraft. The object in question is apparently nothing more than a natural part of the lunar terrain. [[Apollo 16]] photos of the same crater taken a year later show no evidence of artificial structures.

In truth, [[Apollo 20]] was a mission that never got off the ground—literally. It was one of three lunar missions NASA cancelled due to lack of funding along with Apollo missions 18 and 19. The last NASA lunar mission was [[Apollo 17]], launched in 1972. The next Apollo mission, not counting the [[Skylab]] missions, was the [[Apollo-Soyuz Test Project]], coordinated by the United States and the former [[Soviet Union]] in 1975. However, its mission was to remain in low-Earth orbit and to dock with a Soviet [[Soyuz (spacecraft)|Soyuz spacecraft]], something it accomplished successfully. Some mistakenly refer to that mission as Apollo 18.

Some of the [[Multistage rocket|stages]] for the [[Saturn V]] rockets intended for NASA’s [[Canceled Apollo missions|three cancelled lunar missions]] had already been constructed before their cancellation. According to the hoaxer's story, these were all used for the lunar landings of Apollo missions 18, 19 and 20. In reality NASA used one of these to launch [[Skylab]] into orbit in 1973. The others are on display at three American space centers: the [[John F. Kennedy Space Center]] near Cape Canaveral, Florida; the [[Johnson Space Center]] in Houston, Texas and the [[United States Space &amp; Rocket Center]] in Huntsville, Alabama.

==Apollo 20 hoax mission patch==

The 'recreation' mission patch suggests the crew's names as, "Rutledge - Snyder - Leonov" (William Rutledge - Leona Marietta Snyder - Alexei Leonov), with a Latin phrase from Virgilio’s “Bucoliche” (IX, 50), ''{{lang|la|carpent tua poma nepotes}}'', which translates as, ''—your grandsons (descendants) will gather your apples''.&lt;ref&gt;http://wordinfo.info/unit/3681/page:1/s:carpent%20tua%20poma%20nepotes&lt;/ref&gt; The patch deviates from the actual planned, yet aborted, Apollo 20 mission NASA textile patch, with the primary crew embossed as, "Roosa - Lind - Lousma" ([[Stuart Roosa]] - [[Don Leslie Lind]] - [[Jack R. Lousma]]), which had been planned to land at Tycho crater to test a rendezvous mission with an earlier unmanned lander.  [[File:Nasa Apollo 20 hoax comparison.jpg|thumb|]] 

The design also seems to suggest an Egyptian sarcophagus being mutually lifted-up by an Apollo-era Lunar Module and Command Service Module out of a shadowy crater with a blue tomb cloth falling away. The center of the design resembles the Egyptian hieroglyph named: '''bier with body s(dj)r "stchr" ''' &lt;hiero&gt;A55&lt;/hiero&gt; with black impact craters in the sarcophagus.

==In popular culture==
The Apollo 20 hoax was discussed on "Aliens on the Moon: The Truth Exposed", a TV [[documentary]] directed by American television producer Robert Kiviat which was released on July 20, 2014 on the [[SyFy Channel]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nbcnews.com/science/space/aliens-moon-tv-show-adds-weird-ufo-twists-apollo-tales-n159806|title='Aliens on the Moon' TV Show Adds Weird UFO Twists to Apollo Tales|author=Alan Boyle|work=NBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Exhibition planning ==
The amount of money allotted for art in each building is calculated with a formula based on the gross square footage.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt; AIEP's curatorial team develops thematic exhibitions in collaboration with each ambassador, taking into account the host country's artistic traditions and cultural mores. They recommend artists and works of art, negotiate all loans, and propose placement of the art within the embassy residences. After all loans are secured and the art insured, AIE's registrars coordinate with professional art handlers for the [[manufacturing|assembly]], [[Packaging and labeling|packing]], [[crating]] and safe [[shipment]] of each exhibition to post.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Response to ABC 7 Questions on US Department of State's Art In Embassies Program|url=http://dig.abclocal.go.com/wls/documents/052114-wls-iteam-gov-spending-q&amp;a-doc.pdf|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Since 1963, approximately 10,000 pieces of art have been placed in ambassador residences, embassies, and consulates throughout the world, including work by [[Maya Lin]], [[Jeff Koons]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Corcoran|first1=Joe|title=Art in Embassies Makes a Splash for 50th Anniversary|url=http://www.washdiplomat.com/DPouch/2013/January/story5artembassies.html|website=www.washdiplomat.com|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ellsworth Kelly]], [[Martin Puryear]], [[Louise Bourgeois]], [[Joel Shapiro]], [[Benjamin Abramowitz]]&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = U.S. Department of State - Art in Embassies|url = http://art.state.gov/ArtistDetail.aspx?id=137324|website = art.state.gov|accessdate = 2015-06-03}}&lt;/ref&gt; and other prestigious artists.&lt;ref name=nyt&gt;{{cite web|last1=Cohen|first1=Patricia|title=Employing Art Along With Ambassadors | url=https://www.nytimes.com/2009/06/27/arts/design/27embassy.html|website=nytimes.com|accessdate=30 December 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The total value of art on loan to the embassy program is estimated at $200 million.&lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

== Artist exchanges / Residency programs ==
Initiated in 2002, the American Artists Abroad program was created to extend Art In Embassies' exhibitions beyond the walls of U.S. diplomatic residences into local communities. Participating American artists travel to countries where their work is exhibited and engage in a series of public cultural programming activities, such as lectures, workshops, and studio visits.

== Art collections by embassy ==

===Beijing===
The art in [[Embassy of the United States, Beijing|Beijing]] cost about $800,000 but has been appraised at $30 million. &lt;ref name=nyt/&gt;

The program was criticized in 2013 when $1M was awarded for a sculpture at the [[U.S. Embassy]] in London.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-2517666/US-State-Department-spends-1-MILLION-single-granite-sculpture-decorate-new-embassy-London.html&lt;/ref&gt; The project was subsequently scrapped because the sculpture was too heavy for the planned site.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.weeklystandard.com/blogs/state-department-scraps-million-dollar-granite-sculpture-us-embassy-london_882544.html&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Campaignbox Crusades Battles}}

In the '''Battle of Al-Sannabra''' (1113), a [[Crusades|Crusader]] army led by King [[Baldwin I of Jerusalem]] was defeated by a Muslim army sent by the Sultan of the [[Seljuk Turks]] and commanded by [[Mawdud ibn Altuntash]] of [[Mosul]].

==Background==
Beginning in 1110, the Seljuk [[Muhammad I of Great Seljuk|Sultan Muhammad I]] in [[Baghdad]] ordered invasions of the Crusader states for six successive years. "In 1110, 1112, and 1114 the city of [[Edessa, Mesopotamia|Edessa]] was the objective; in 1113 [[Galilee]] was invaded, and in 1111 and 1115 the Latin possessions which lay east of the [[Orontes River|Orontes]] between [[Halab|Aleppo]] and [[Shaizar]]."&lt;ref name="Smail, p 55"&gt;Smail, p 55&lt;/ref&gt; 

The attack on Edessa in 1110 failed to take the city. In 1111, Mawdud of Mosul led a host which fought Baldwin I's Frankish army to a draw in the [[Battle of Shaizar (1111)|Battle of Shaizar]]. Afterward, the Muslim leader's army dispersed because of its lack of success and plunder. In 1112 and 1114, the Muslim [[counterattack]] against Edessa was weak. In the other four years, the Crusader states - the [[Kingdom of Jerusalem]], [[Principality of Antioch]], [[County of Tripoli]] and [[County of Edessa]] - joined forces in defense. 

==Battle==

In 1113, Mawdud joined [[Toghtekin]] of [[Damascus]] and their combined army aimed to cross the [[Jordan River]] south of the [[Sea of Galilee]]. Baldwin I offered battle near the bridge of Al-Sannabra. Mawdud used the device of a feigned flight to entice Baldwin I into rashly ordering a charge.&lt;ref&gt;Smail, p 79&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Franks|Frankish]] army was surprised and beaten when it unexpectedly ran into the main Turkish army. 

The surviving Crusaders kept their cohesion and fell back to a hill west of the inland sea where they fortified their camp. In this position they were reinforced from [[Tripoli]] and [[Antioch]] but remained inert.&lt;ref name="Smail, p 55"/&gt; A number of Christian pilgrims also rallied to the army after Al-Sannabra. 

Unable to annihilate the Crusaders, Mawdud watched them with his main army while sending raiding columns to ravage the countryside and sack the town of [[Nablus]]. In this, Mawdud anticipated the strategy of [[Saladin]] in two later campaigns that were marked by the [[Battle of Belvoir Castle (1182)]] and the [[Battle of Al-Fule (1183)]]. As in these campaigns, the Frankish field army could oppose the main Muslim army, but it could not stop raiding forces from doing great damage to crops and towns. 

While the Turkish raiders roamed freely through Crusader lands, the local Muslim farmers entered into friendly relations with them. This deeply troubled the Frankish land magnates, who ultimately depended upon rents from cultivators of the soil.

==Aftermath==

Mawdud was unable to make any permanent conquests after his victory. Soon afterward, he was assassinated and Aq-Sunqur Bursuqi took command of the failed attempt against Edessa in 1114.&lt;ref&gt;Smail, p 143&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger of Salerno]] routed the last Seljuk invading army at the [[Battle of Sarmin]] after a protracted campaign in 1115.

The '''Battle of Waterloo reenactment''' is an annual modern recreation of the 19th century [[Battle of Waterloo]] on the original battlefield in [[Waterloo, Belgium]]. 
	
It is held every June on the weekend nearest to the historic date of the Battle of Waterloo (18 June 1815). In a regular year there will be 600–800 reenactors. The 5-year-anniversaries are greater events with 1,500–2,000 reenactors from France, Belgium, The Netherlands, Great Britain, Germany, Poland and Russia.

A major event, one of the largest ever staged, was held on the site of the battle to mark the 200th anniversary of the engagement.  6,200 re-enactors, 330 horses, and 120 cannons&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/battle-of-waterloo/11688355/Battle-of-Waterloo-relived-the-sound-a-fury-of-a-Napoleonic-war-re-enactment.html Battle of Waterloo relived: the sound a fury of a Napoleonic war re-enactment, The Telegraph]&lt;/ref&gt; took part in actions in an arena area close to [[La Haye Sainte]].

'''Bernhard, schavuit van Oranje''' ([[English language|English title]]: '''''Bernhard, scoundrel of Orange''''') is a [[Netherlands|Dutch]] television program depicting the more than only turbulent life of a [[prince consort]]. It is a compelling drama concerning a man who tries to be himself, but must survive deep crises, finally to see the real meaning of love. Within the [[Monarchy of the Netherlands|Dutch royal family]] there is actually no more talked about character than [[Prince Bernhard of Lippe-Biesterfeld]]. Whether it concerns [[Greet Hofmans]], extramarital affairs, or Lockheed, Prince Bernhard faced a lot of scandals throughout the course of his life. Besides this he was, and is a person, loved by many as a war hero. A man of extremes. In four parts Prince Bernhard tells the tale of his life. Not only through the spyglass, but especially to his grandson's wife, [[Princess Máxima of the Netherlands]], who will be soon the Queen next to [[Willem-Alexander, Prince of Orange|Prince Willem-Alexander]]. In a way, she takes the same position as Prince Bernhard did in his life. In their conversations and discussions it becomes clear how much they are different, but also how much they are the same. For [[Princess Máxima of the Netherlands|Princess Máxima]] this is sometimes very confronting. The tale drags us throughout the course of the Prince's life, from [[Soestdijk]], his beloved German Reckenwalde, Berlin, London, [[Argentina]] and Canada.

The '''Beverley Folk Festival''' was a three-day celebration of music, workshops, comedy and spoken word, held at [[Beverley Racecourse]] in [[Beverley]], [[East Riding of Yorkshire]], [[England]]. As of 2018, it will be replaced by an enlarged and reformed '''Beverley Fringe Festival'''.

Whilst British Folk Music, both traditional and new, remains at the heart of the festival, it also features many genres of music including [[Americana (music)|Americana]], [[world music]], [[rock music|rock]], a variety of [[acoustic music|acoustic]] performances and much more. In recent years it has expanded to encompass comedy, film, poetry, drama, literature and storytelling.

Past line-ups have ranged from folk legends such as [[The Watersons]], [[Steeleye Span]], [[Oysterband]], [[Ralph McTell]] and the [[Peatbog Faeries]], to [[Billy Bragg]], [[Barbara Dickson]] and [[The Proclaimers]]. Contemporary performers have included [[Seth Lakeman]], [[Bellowhead]], [[Eliza Carthy]] and [[Blackbeard's Tea Party]].  Outside the realms of mainstream folk music, headliners have ranged from [[Joe Brown (singer)|Joe Brown]] to [[Paul Carrack]].

==History==

Established in 1983, the festival was originally organised by the White Horse Folk Club.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/music/reviews/beverley-folk-festival-various-venues-7827458.html|title=Beverley Folk Festival, various venues|date=8 June 2012|work= The Independent}}&lt;/ref&gt;. Over the years it grew steadily in size and became based at Beverley Leisure Centre, with the venue hosting the main stage, with further music and craft tents on the adjacent site along with the campsite. Nearby pubs in the town including the Sun Inn and Tiger Inn also hosted live music, and the town centre various fringe events. Songwriter and radio broadcaster [[Mike Harding]], and playwright and dramatist [[John Godber]] are among the festival patrons.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://justbeverley.co.uk/articles/1356/mike-harding-and-john-godber-encourage-music-lovers-to-support-beverley-folk-festival|title=Mike Harding and John Godber Encourage Music Lovers to support Beverley Folk Festival|date=30 May 2017|work= Just Beverley}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

==Racecourse Move==

In 2013, the festival moved to [[Beverley Racecourse]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://beverley-racecourse.co.uk/news/new-music-festival-moves-to-the-racecourse|title=Music festival moves to the Racecourse|date=25 February 2013|work=Beverley Racecourse}}&lt;/ref&gt;. The Racecourse site included: ''The Festival Village'' (food and craft stalls and open-air performances), ''Main Stage Marquee (The Big Top)'' (large marquee hosting festival headliners, with a capacity of over 1000), ''Concert Marquee (The Little Top)'' (smaller marquee showcasing new and old artists), ''The Atom'' (venue hosting the Late Night and Moonbeams Sessions, beer tent and improvised music), ''The Racecourse Rooms'' (main Grandstand function rooms/bars hosting talks, open music sessions, The Westwood Sessions and comedy, drama and talks), and ''Children’s Marquee'' (running arts, crafts and music for children).

Alongside the Racecourse site continued the ''Fringe Festival'', in and around Beverley Market Place and pubs.

==Management==

The festival is run on a [[not-for-profit]] basis and is managed by a board of volunteer directors. Other volunteers are also key to the festival, with dozens of people taking part as stewards, on the reception desk, directing parking, selling merchandise and as part of the recycling (Green) team, etc.  Infrastructure is managed by Cornucopia Events with whom the festival has a very close and mutually helpful relationship.   

==2018 Cancellation==

It was announced in April 2018 that the years festival would be cancelled &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-england-humber-43867140|title=Long-running Beverley Folk Festival cancelled|date=23 April 2018|work=BBC News}}&lt;/ref&gt;, citing the loss of its primary source of funding as the reason for its cancellation. The company was placed into immediate voluntary liquidation.

==2018 Fringe Festival==

Within hours of the news emerging of the cancellation of the festival, organisers involved in Fringe Festival events announced their intention to host an enlarged fringe to fill the void. 

Reflecting very much the festival origins and roots, a reformed and expanded Fringe Festival ran over the planned three days with performances at venues including The Tiger, Sun Inn and Monks Walk public houses, Memorial Hall, East Riding Theatre, a well in and around the town centre &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://justbeverley.co.uk/articles/1960/beverley-fringe-expands-to-fill-folk-festival-hole-on-june-15-17|title=Beverley Fringe Expands to fill Folk-Festival hole|date=30 May 2018|work= Just Beverley}}&lt;/ref&gt;.

'''COMDEX''' (an abbreviation of '''Computer Dealers' Exhibition''') was a [[computer expo]] [[trade show]] held at various locations in the  [[Las Vegas Valley]] of [[Nevada]], USA, each November from 1979 to 2003.  It was one of the largest computer [[trade show]]s in the world, usually second only to the German [[CeBIT]], and by many accounts one of the largest trade shows in any industry sector, and COMDEX exhibitions have been held in many other countries from 1982 to 2005, altogether 185 shows. The first COMDEX was held in 1979 at the [[MGM Grand Hotel and Casino|MGM Grand]] (now [[Bally's Las Vegas|Bally's]]), with 167 exhibitors and 3904 attendees. In 1981, the first '''COMDEX/Spring''' was held in [[New York City]].

==History==

===Organizers===
COMDEX was started by '''The Interface Group''', whose organizers included [[Sheldon Adelson]], Robert Lively and Richard Katzeff. In 1995, they later sold it to the Japanese technology [[Conglomerate (company)|conglomerate]] [[Softbank Corp]]. In 2001, Softbank sold the show to Key3Media, a spin-off of [[Ziff Davis]]. After going into a [[Chapter 11]] bankruptcy in February 2003, Key3Media resurfaced as Medialive International with a cash infusion from Thomas Weisel Capital Partners, which had previously invested in the company. In November 2006, [[Forbes (magazine)|Forbes magazine]] reported that [[United Business Media]] plc had purchased the events assets of MediaLive International Inc.

===Attendance===
COMDEX was originally open only to those directly involved in the computer industry, it was the one show where all levels of manufacturers and developers of computers, [[peripheral]]s, [[software]], components, and accessories came in direct contact with retailers, consultants and their competitors.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}

Colloquially known as "[[Geek]] Week", COMDEX evolved into a major technical [[Convention (meeting)|convention]], with the industry making major product announcements and releases there.  Numerous small companies from around the world rose to prominence following appearance at COMDEX, and industry leaders sought opportunities to make keynote addresses.  Most discussed the computer industry, history, trends and future potential.The COMDEX Conference, attracting over 4000 paying attendees, became an important launch platform for key technologies. Bluetooth(tm) and USB had conference programming and associated exhibition floor pavilions to help these technologies and start up companies be seen in such a large event and marketplace. In 1999, [[Linus Torvalds]] attended the exhibition to talk about the [[Linux]] family of [[operating system]] .{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}} A Linux conference and exhibition hall was treated as co-located event, helping elevate the open source products. 

In the late 1980s, COMDEX was opened to the general public, causing an explosion in attendance. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}  It however diluted COMDEX's focus in the industry.{{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}  Retailers and [[consultant]]s complained that 'leading edge' customers, upon whom they relied for early adoption of new technology, were buying products at 'show specials' and then expecting the dealers to support those products. {{Citation needed|date=December 2015}}. The broadening of audience criteria came about as IT departments decentralized and purchasing of technology products shifted from a common corporate IT budget to departments and company divisions, mirroring mainframes shifting to decentralized networks and local area networking, and later the Internet as the corporate backbone.

===Cities other than Las Vegas===
After the Spring 1981 show in [[New York City]] and 1982 in [[Atlantic City]], COMDEX began regular spring shows in [[Atlanta, Georgia]] from 1983 through 1988. Then alternated sites between Atlanta and [[Chicago, Illinois|Chicago]].  The final Atlanta Spring COMDEX was held in 1997; the last Spring COMDEX was planned to Chicago in April 2003 but cancelled.

The first COMDEX show outside the US was held in [[Amsterdam]] 1982. In the record years 1998 and 2000, 21 exhibitions were arranged yearly all over the World: Europe, Asia, Africa, Australia and other parts of America. 69% of the 185 shows took place outside the US. Even when the US shows were cancelled, they kept on for short time, e.g. [[Gothenburg]] and [[São Paulo]] 2004 and the last in [[Athens]] in November 2005. The decline occurred globally: the 2000 show in [[Basel]] with 1400 exhibitors drew 79000 attendees, but 2001 17% less.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.netzwoche.ch/de-CH/News/2001/10/01/OrbitComdex-Von-beinahe-allem-weniger.aspx?agent=browser Report from COMDEX 2001 in Basel (de)]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Early 2000s and closing===
Following COMDEX Fall 1999 (in Las Vegas), organizers made major changes to their criteria for admission of [[News media|mass media]], adjusting criteria to accommodate bloggers with significant market reach, but also restricting simple and open access to anyone declaring themselves 'media'. It offered regular public attendance for the general public.

In 2000, major companies such as [[IBM]], [[Apple Inc.|Apple]], and [[Compaq]] (now merged with [[Hewlett-Packard]]) decided to discontinue their involvement with COMDEX to allocate resources more efficiently, usually through their own corporate events or other direct-to-consumer selling (Apple Stores), and the [[dot-com bubble]] caused a decline on the IT market. To reduce costs following the market downturns after the 9/11 attacks many would-be exhibitors stopped renting out or scaled back official COMDEX booths on the convention center floors, and set up invitation-only suites in various Las Vegas hotels.&lt;ref name=comdex2004cancelled&gt;[http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/67462/comdex_cancels_november_2004_tech_convention/index.html Comdex Cancels November 2004 Tech Convention], 24 June 2004, By MATTHEW FORDAHL, redOrbit {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090823072906/http://www.redorbit.com/news/technology/67462/comdex_cancels_november_2004_tech_convention/index.html |date=August 23, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; This also allowed exhibitors to concentrate their efforts on industry attendees rather than the general public.

COMDEX/Fall 2001 organizers at Los Angeles-based Key3Media Group Inc. said they expected attendance to fall from the previous year's 200,000 to 150,000. They also expected the number of exhibitors to decline from 2,350 to 2,000 and the square footage of exhibitor space to slide from just over 1 million to 750,000.

The last Las Vegas show in November 2003 attracted only 500 exhibitors and 40,000 visitors.

In June 2004, COMDEX cancelled the 2004 exhibition in Las Vegas,&lt;ref name=comdex2004cancelled /&gt; effectively making the [[Consumer Electronics Show]] its replacement in Las Vegas. By 2004 the personal computer had become a commodity item priced at levels individual departments and consumers overall could buy without needing much corporate oversight, so "computers" became just one of many products in the consumer electronics channels and the Consumer Electronics Show.

==COMDEXvirtual==
A COMDEX event was originally designed to exist only on the internet without a physical meeting location. It was announced to commence during November 16–17, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;[http://multivu.prnewswire.com/mnr/ubm/42706/ Introducing the New COMDEX, the Next Generation in Virtual Events] March 4, 2010, PRNewswire&lt;/ref&gt; The COMDEX website (www.comdex.com) was operated by [[TechWeb]], a [[United Business Media]] company.

Everything Channel and sister company UBM studios (both United Business Media Companies) partnered to deliver COMDEXvirtual (www.comdexvirtual.com) to the global IT channel community in November 2010. Nearly 5,000 attended the event over the course of the two days, making COMDEXvirtual the largest independent virtual tradeshow in the IT industry.  The agenda featured more than 100 speakers and nearly 50 sessions on topics ranging from cloud to mobility and virtualization, to address the event's theme—New Business Solutions: Embracing Disruptive Technologies &amp; Changing Delivery Models. In addition to educational sessions, there was also an Expo Hall with nearly 30 exhibitors including IBM, Intel, Microsoft, Symantec, Panasonic, and D&amp;H. COMDEXvirtual (www.comdexvirtual.com) 2010 was available on-demand through May 17, 2011.  The event returned on November 15 &amp; 16, 2011, with 4,300 attendees, and ultimately in 2012.

===Interop===
Interop is an annual trade fair for information technology organised by UBM TechWeb. It takes place at four different locations at various times of the year: [[Mumbai]] (India), [[New York City]] ([[New York (state)|NY]], USA), [[Tokyo]] (Japan), and [[Las Vegas]] ([[Nevada|NV]], USA). 2011 marked Interop's 25th anniversary and throughout that time, Interop has promoted interoperability and openness, beginning with IP networks and continuing in today's emerging cloud computing era. For every US event, Interop volunteers build a network (called the InteropNet) using tools from various vendors to demonstrate the latest technologies and interoperability.

The '''causes and explanations of the [[1948 Palestinian exodus|exodus of Palestinian Arabs]]''' that arose during the [[1947–1948 Civil War in Mandatory Palestine]] and the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] are a matter of great controversy between historians, journalists and commentators of the [[Arab–Israeli conflict]].

==Outline of the historical debate==
{{Palestinians}}

===Initial positions and criticisms===
In the first decades after the exodus two diametrically opposed schools of analysis could be distinguished. In the words of [[Erskine Barton Childers|Erskine Childers]]:&lt;ref name="Childers61" &gt;Erskine Childers, "The Other Exodus", ''[[The Spectator]]'', May 12, 1961, reprinted in [[Walter Laqueur]] (ed.) ''The Israel–Arab Reader: A Documentary History of the Middle East Conflict,''(1969) rev. ed. Pelican Books 1970 pp. 179–188.&lt;!--p. 183 makes no sense here--&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; "Israel claims that the Arabs left because they were ordered to, and deliberately incited into panic, by their own leaders who wanted the field cleared for the 1948 war," while "The Arabs charge that their people were evicted at bayonet-point and by panic deliberately incited by the Zionists."

====Palestinian and Arab position====
According to [[Steven Glazer]]&lt;ref name = "Glazer-1980-p96"/&gt; "[t]he Arab view of history has maintained that the Palestinians did not leave their homes voluntarily [but] were expelled by Zionist aggression.... Sources sympathetic to the Arab viewpoint have seen in the events of 1948 the fulfilment of a long dreamed-of Zionist plan to rid Palestine of its Arab population, thus forcibly transforming Palestine into a Jewish state." [[Nur Masalha]] and [[Walid Khalidi]] points at the influence of thinking about "transfer" of the Arab population to other Arab countries, among Zionists in the years prior to the exodus. In 1961 Khalidi also said that the Zionists had military superiority and that [[Plan Dalet]], the Zionists' military plan executed in April and May 1948, aimed at expelling the Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;Walid Khalidi, 1988, "Plan Dalet: Master Plan for the Conquest of Palestine", ''J. Palestine Studies'' 18(1), pp. 4–33, earlier published in 1961.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Israeli position====
In his work dedicated to the topic, "A Historical Survey of Proposals to Transfer Arabs from Palestine 1895 - 1947", Rabbi Dr. Chaim Simons provided examples of the writings and recorded words of important Zionist leaders including Theodore Herzl, David Ben-Gurion, Chaim Weizmann, Vladimir Jabotinsky, Baron Edmund de Rothschild  and Moshe Shertok, demonstrating that the concept of 'transfer' was present from the earliest days of Zionism, that it was viewed as being a crucial action, and concludes that 'transfer' was in fact Zionist policy. Simons concludes further that the Zionist leadership has no viable alternative. &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Simons |first=Chaim||title=A Historical Survey of Proposals to Transfer Arabs from Palestine 1895 - 1947|publisher=KTAV Pub Inc |year=1988 |isbn=978-0881253009|url=http://chaimsimons.net/transfer.html}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Writing in 1980 Glazer summarized the position of Zionist historians up to that point, notably Schechtman, Kohn, Jon Kymche and Syrkin, as saying:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"... the Arabs in Palestine were asked to stay and live as citizens in the Jewish state. Instead, they chose to leave, either because they were unwilling to live with the Jews, or because they expected an Arab military victory which would annihilate the Zionists. They thought they could leave temporarily and return at their leisure. Later, an additional claim was put forth, namely that the Palestinians were ordered to leave, with radio broadcasts instructing them to quit their homes."&lt;ref name = "Glazer-1980-p96"&gt;Steven Glazer, 1980, "The Palestinian Exodus in 1948", ''J. Palestine Studies'' 9(4), pp. 96–118.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

At that time (1980) Zionist historians had generally attributed the Arab leaders' alleged calls for a mass evacuation to the period before the proclamation of Israeli statehood.&lt;ref name = "Glazer-1980-p96"/&gt; They generally believed that, after that period, expulsion became standard policy and was carried out systematically.&lt;ref name = "Glazer-1980-p96"/&gt; As described below, the narratives presented have been influenced by the release of previously unseen documents in the 1980s. In a later review in 2000 Mendes pointed to the prevailing Jewish view being that "... it was an absolute fact that the Palestinian Arabs departed in 1948 at the behest of their own leaders, and that Israel desperately attempted to persuade them to stay." Mendes then examines the work of [[New Historians|'new historian']] Benny Morris, based on these newly released documents, and his influence on the debate, concluding that, whilst such Zionist writers add to the traditional understanding of the Palestinian exodus, their arguments do not disprove Morris' multi-causal explanation.&lt;ref name = "Mendes-AJDS"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.academia.edu/3559666/A_HISTORICAL_CONTROVERSY_THE_CAUSES_OF_THE_PALESTINIAN_REFUGEE_PROBLEM_by_Philip_Mendes_address_to_Melbourne_Jewish_Museum_20_10_2000|title=A historical controversy: the causes of the Palestinian refugee problem|last=Mendes|first=Philip|publisher=Acaemia|year=2000|quote=[as reported by Philip Mendes]| accessdate=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Criticism of traditional positions====
Alternative explanations have also been offered. For instance Peretz&lt;ref name= "Mendes-AJDS" /&gt; and Gabbay&lt;ref name = "Mendes-AJDS"/&gt; emphasize the psychological component: panic or hysteria swept the Palestinians and caused the exodus.{{Failed verification|date=July 2017|reason=The Mendes paper does not mention either Peretz or Gabbay}} They attributed this to diverse causes like breakdown of Palestinian leadership, [[Wiktionary:atrocity|atrocity]] stories and Jewish military victories. Glazer also says, "Israeli public opinion has maintained that as the Arabs planned to massacre the Jews, when the Jews began winning the war the Arabs fled, fearing the same treatment would be suffered on them."

Globally, in his paper of 1981, Glazer wrote, "Both Palestinians and Israeli spokesmen and adherents have sought to link the events of 1948 with their claims to the land today." He claims that one "fundamental [problem of the subject is to deal] with historians who are overtly biased" and try to identify the factors that influence this.&lt;ref name = "Glazer-1980-p96"/&gt;

===Opening of archives===
In the 1980s Israel and United Kingdom opened up part of their archives for investigation by historians. This favored a more critical and factual analysis of the 1948 events. As a result more detailed and comprehensive description of the Palestinian exodus was published, notably Morris' ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem''.&lt;ref name=morrisrev&gt;Benny Morris (2004), ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited'', Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|0 521 00967 7}} (pbk.)&lt;/ref&gt; Morris distinguishes [[1948 Palestinian exodus|four waves]] of refugees, the second, third and fourth of them coinciding with Israeli military offensives, when Arab Palestinians fled the fighting, were frightened away, or were expelled.

A document produced by the Israeli Defence Forces Intelligence Service entitled "The Emigration of the Arabs of Palestine in the Period 1/12/1947 – 1/6/1948" was dated 30 June 1948 and became widely known around 1985.

The document details 11 factors which caused the exodus, and lists them "in order of importance":
# Direct, hostile Jewish [ [[Haganah]]/[[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] ] operations against Arab settlements.
# The effect of our [Haganah/IDF] hostile operations against nearby [Arab] settlements... (... especially the fall of large neighbouring centers).
# Operation of [Jewish] dissidents [ [[Irgun|Irgun Tzvai Leumi]] and [[Lehi (group)|Lohamei Herut Yisrael]]]
# Orders and decrees by Arab institutions and gangs [irregulars].
# Jewish whispering operations [psychological warfare], aimed at frightening away Arab inhabitants.
# Ultimate expulsion orders [by Jewish forces]
# Fear of Jewish [retaliatory] response [following] major Arab attack on Jews.
# The appearance of gangs [irregular Arab forces] and non-local fighters in the vicinity of a village.
# Fear of Arab invasion and its consequences [mainly near the borders].
# Isolated Arab villages in purely [predominantly] Jewish areas.
# Various local factors and general fear of the future.&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris, 1986,  [https://www.jstor.org/stable/4283093?seq=1 The Causes and Character of the Arab Exodus from Palestine: The Israel Defence Forces Intelligence Branch Analysis of June 1948]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris: [[1948 and After]]: Israel and the Palestinians, {{ISBN|0-19-827929-9}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Shay Hazkani, "In the past two decades, following the powerful reverberations (concerning the cause of the [[Nakba]]) triggered by the publication of books written by those dubbed the “[[New Historians]],” the Israeli archives revoked access to much of the explosive material. Archived Israeli documents that reported the expulsion of Palestinians, massacres or rapes perpetrated by Israeli soldiers, along with other events considered embarrassing by the establishment, were reclassified as “top secret.”&lt;ref name=Ha&gt;Haaretz (May 16, 2013) by Shay Hazkani. Catastrophic thinking: Did Ben-Gurion try to rewrite history?&lt;/ref&gt;

===Political and sociological influences on the historical debate===
Several Israeli sociologists have studied the influence on the historical debate of the political and sociological situations in Israel. Referring to modern sociological schools and commenting historians methodology in the context of the 1948 war and the Palestinian exodus, [[Uri Ram]] considers that "contemporary historical revision and debates should be interpreted ... against the backdrop of specific crises in national identities and as an indication of crisis in national identity in the global era."&lt;ref name = "ram224"&gt;[[Uri Ram]], "The Future of the Past in Israel: A Sociology of Knowledge Approach", in [[Benny Morris]], ''Making Israel'', pp. 224–226.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to him, "the three leading schools writing Israeli history reflect and articulate [the] political-cultural divisions [in the Israeli society]. Traditional mainstream history is national, mostly the labor movement version. On its fringe, a critical school of history emerged in the 1980s associated with [[post-Zionism]] (even if some of its protagonists identify as Zionists) [and] finally, in the 1990s efforts have been made to create a counterschool of [[neo-Zionism|neo-Zionist]] history...."&lt;ref name = "ram224"/&gt;

=="Concept of transfer in Zionism"==
Discussion of the "idea of transfer" in political Zionism became popular beginning in the 1980s when Israel declassified documents pertaining to the [[1948 Arab–Israeli War]] period and the so-called [[New Historians]] began publishing articles and books based on these documents. The Zionist "concept of transfer" was cited by Palestinian authors such as [[Nur Masalha]] and [[Walid Khalidi]] to support their argument that the Zionist Yishuv followed an expulsion policy, and echoed by a range of Israeli authors including Simons &lt;ref name=Simons /&gt; and Flapan&lt;ref name=Flapan /&gt;. Other Israeli historians, such as Morris&lt;ref name=morrisrev /&gt;, reject the idea that "transfer" thinking led to a political expulsion policy as such, but they explain that the idea of transfer was endorsed in practice by mainstream Zionist leaders, particularly [[David Ben-Gurion]]. Critics of the "transfer principle" theory cite addresses by the Zionist leadership that publicly preached co-existence with the Arabs, but in private put forward their own plans, or gave support to plans involving the transfer of Arabs from Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://chaimsimons.net/transfer05.html|title=A Historical Survey of Proposals to Transfer Arabs from Palestine 1895 - 1947 |author=Rabbi Dr. Chaim Simons|edition=e-pub|year=2004|quote=[see chapters on Theodore Herzl and Chaim Weizmann]| accessdate=July 15, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The idea that "transfer ideology" contributed to the exodus was first brought up by several Palestinian authors, and supported by [[Erskine Childers (UN)|Erskine Childers]] in his 1971 article, "The wordless wish". In 1961 Walid Khalidi referred to the transfer idea to support his idea that the Yishuv followed an expulsion policy in April and May 1948.&lt;ref name="W. Khalidi 1961"&gt;W. Khalidi, "Plan Dalet: master plan for the conquest of Palestine", ''J. Palestine Studies'' 18 (1), 1988, pp. 4–33 (published earlier in ''Middle East Forum'' in 1961).&lt;/ref&gt; In the 1980s, historian [[Benny Morris]] became the most well-known advocate of the existence of the "transfer idea".&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris (1989) The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947-1949. Cambridge University Press. {{ISBN|978-0521338899}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Morris, while not discounting other reasons for the exodus, the "transfer principle" theory suggests that this prevalent "attitude of transfer" is what made it easy for the Jewish population to accept it and for local [[Haganah]] and [[Israel Defense Forces|IDF]] commanders to resort to various means of expelling the Arab population.

He also notes that the attempt to achieve a demographic shift through ''[[aliyah]]'' (Jewish immigration to the land of Israel) had not been successful. As a result, some Zionist leaders adopted the transfer of a large Arab population as the only viable solution.&lt;ref&gt;Morris2, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris also points out that "[if] Zionist support for 'Transfer' really is 'unambiguous'; the connection between that support and what actually happened during the war is far more tenuous than Arabs propagandists will allow." (Morris, p.&amp;nbsp;6)

To this he adds that "From April 1948, Ben-Gurion is projecting a message of transfer. There is no explicit order of his in writing, there is no orderly comprehensive policy, but there is an atmosphere of [population] transfer. The transfer idea is in the air. The entire leadership understands that this is the idea. The officer corps understands what is required of them. Under Ben-Gurion, a consensus of transfer is created."&lt;ref name = "Morris-20080108"&gt;[http://www.logosjournal.com/morris.htm Morris in an interview with ''Haaretz'', 8 January 2004]&lt;/ref&gt;

===Origins of the "Transfer Idea"===
Morris concludes that Zionism's aim was "to transform a land which was 'Arab' into a 'Jewish' state and a Jewish state could not have arisen without a major displacement of Arab population". According to Morris only after Arab resistance emerged did this become a rationale for transfer.&lt;ref name="Morris 2004, p. 60"&gt;Morris 2004, p. 60.&lt;/ref&gt; Other authors, including Palestinian writers and Israeli [[New Historians]], have also described this attitude as a prevalent notion in Zionist thinking and as a major factor in the exodus.&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Ami, Shlomo. ''Scars of War, Wounds of Peace: The Israeli–Arab Tragedy''. 2005, Weidenfeld &amp; Nicolson. {{ISBN|0-297-84883-6}}.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Peel Commission's plan and Yishuv's reaction===
The idea of [[population transfer]] was briefly placed on the Mandate's political agenda in 1937 by the [[Peel Commission]]. The commission recommended that Britain should withdraw from Palestine and that the land be partitioned between Jews and Arabs. It called for a "''transfer'' of land and an ''exchange'' of population", including the removal of 250,000 Palestinian Arabs from what would become the Jewish state,&lt;ref&gt;Arzt, 1997, p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; along the lines of the mutual population exchange between the Turkish and Greek populations after the Greco-Turkish War of 1922. According to the plan "in the last resort" the transfer of Arabs from the Jewish part would be compulsory.&lt;ref&gt;Masalha, ''Expulsion of the Palestinians'', 1992, {{ISBN|0-88728-235-0}}, p. 61.&lt;/ref&gt; The transfer would be voluntary in as far as Arab leaders were required to agree with it, but after that it would be almost inevitable that it would have to be forced upon the population.&lt;ref&gt;Masalha, pp. 49–84.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Nur Masalha]], heavy Zionist lobbying had been necessary for the Peel commission to propose this "in the last resort" compulsory transfer. [[Sharett|Shertok]], [[Chaim Weizmann|Weizmann]] and Ben-Gurion had travelled to London to talk it over, not only with members of the commission, but also with numerous politicians and officials whom the commission would be likely to consult.&lt;ref&gt;Masalha, pp. 52–60.&lt;/ref&gt; This solution was embraced by Zionist leaders.&lt;ref&gt;Masalha, pp. 60–67.&lt;/ref&gt; Masalha also says that Ben-Gurion saw partition only as an intermediate stage in the establishment of Israel, before the Jewish state could expand to all of Palestine using force.&lt;ref&gt;Masalha, p. 107.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Morris, Arab leaders, such as [[Abdullah I of Jordan|Emir Abdullah]] of Transjordan and [[Nuri as-Said]] of Iraq, supported the idea of a population transfer.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benny Morris|Morris, Benny]]. ''1948: The History of the First Arab–Israeli War''. New Haven: Yale University Press, 2008. p. 19.&lt;/ref&gt; However, while Ben-Gurion was in favor of the Peel plan, he and other Zionist leaders considered it important that it be publicized as a British plan and not a Zionist plan. To this end, Morris quotes [[Moshe Sharett]], director of the Jewish Agency's Political Department, who said (during a meeting of the [[Jewish Agency Executive]] on 7 May 1944) to consider the [[Labour Party (UK)|British Labour Party Executive's]] resolution supporting transfer: "Transfer could be the crowning achievements, the final stage in the development of [our] policy, but certainly not the point of departure. By [speaking publicly and prematurely] we could mobilizing vast forces against the matter and cause it to fail, in advance.... What will happen once the Jewish state is established—it is very possible that the result will be the transfer of Arabs."&lt;ref&gt;quoted in Morris, 2001, p. 46.&lt;/ref&gt;

All of the other members of the JAE present, including [[Yitzhak Gruenbaum]] (later Israel's first interior minister), [[Eliyahu Dobkin]] (director of the immigration department), [[Eliezer Kaplan]] (Israel's first finance minister), [[Dov Yosef]] (later Israel's justice minister) and [[Werner David Senator]] (a Hebrew University executive) spoke favorably of the transfer principle.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2001, p. 47.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris summarises the attitude of the Jewish Agency Executive on 12 June 1938 as: "all preferred a 'voluntary' transfer; but most were also agreeable to a compulsory transfer."&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2004, p. 50.&lt;/ref&gt;

At the twentieth Zionist Congress, held in Zurich in August 1937, the Peel Commission's plan was discussed and rejected on the ground that a larger part of Palestine should be assigned to them. According to Masalha, compulsory transfer was accepted as morally just by a majority although many doubted its feasibility.&lt;ref&gt;Masalha, pp. 67–80.&lt;/ref&gt; Partition, however, was not acceptable for [[Ussishkin]], head of the [[Jewish National Fund]], who said, "The Arab people have immense areas of land at their disposal; our people have nothing except a grave's plot. We demand that our inheritance, Palestine, be returned to us, and if there is no room for Arabs, they have the opportunity of going to Iraq."&lt;ref&gt;Masalha, p. 78.&lt;/ref&gt;

The immediately succeeding [[Woodhead Commission]], called to "examine the Peel Commission plan in detail and to recommend an actual partition plan" effectively removed the idea of transfer from the options under consideration by the British, and the 1939 White Paper proposed a complete end to immigration.

According to Masalha "the defeat of the partition plan in no way diminished the determination of the Ben-Gurion camp ... to continue working for the removal of the native population."&lt;ref&gt;Masalha, p. 80.&lt;/ref&gt; In November 1937 a Population Transfer Committee was appointed to investigate the practicalities of transfer. It discussed details of the costs, specific places for relocation of the Palestinians, and the order in which they should be transferred. In view of the need for land it concluded that the rural population should be transferred before the townspeople, and that a village by village manner would be best.&lt;ref&gt;Masalha, pp. 93–106.&lt;/ref&gt; In June 1938 Ben-Gurion summed up the mood in the JAE: "I support compulsory transfer. I do not see anything immoral in it." Regarding the unwillingness of the British to implement it, land expropriation was seen as a major mechanism to precipitate a Palestinian exodus. Also the remaining Palestinians should not be left with substantial landholdings.&lt;ref&gt;Masalha, p. 117.&lt;/ref&gt;

==="Transfer Idea" during 1947–1949===
{{Further|Transfer Committee}}
In early November 1947, some weeks before the [[United Nations General Assembly Resolution 181|UN partition resolution]], the Jewish Agency Executive decided that it would be best to deny Israeli citizenship to as many Arabs as possible. As Ben-Gurion explained, in the event of hostilities, if the Arabs also held citizenship of the Arab state it would be possible to expel them as resident aliens, which was better than imprisoning them.&lt;ref&gt;Masalha, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt;

In Flapan's&lt;ref&gt;Flapan, Simha (1987): "The Palestinian Exodus of 1948". ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', vol. 16, no. 4. (Summer, 1987), p. 12.&lt;/ref&gt; view, with the proclamation of the birth of Israel and the Arab governments' invasion into the new state, those Arabs who had remained in Israel after 15 May were viewed as "a security problem", a potential fifth column, even though they had not participated in the war and had stayed in Israel hoping to live in peace and equality, as promised in the Declaration of Independence. In the opinion of the author, that document had not altered Ben-Gurion's overall conception: once the Arab areas he considered vital to the constitution of the new state had been brought under Israeli control, there still remained the problem of their inhabitants.

According to Flapan&lt;ref name=Flapan&gt;Flapan, Simha (1987): "The Palestinian Exodus of 1948". ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', vol. 16, no. 4. (Summer, 1987), p. 16.&lt;/ref&gt; "Ben-Gurion appointed what became known as the transfer committee, composed of Weitz, Danin, and Zalman Lipshitz, a cartographer. At the basis of its recommendations, presented to Ben-Gurion in October 1948, was the idea that the number of Arabs should not amount to more than 15 percent of Israel's total population, which at that time meant about 100,000."&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Gurion, D.: ''War Diaries'', 18 August 1948, pp. 652–54; 27 October 1948, pp. 776. Cited in Flapan, Simha (1987): "The Palestinian Exodus of 1948". ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', vol. 16, no. 4. (Summer, 1987), pp. 3–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

In the view of Flapan&lt;ref&gt;Flapan, Simha (1987): "The Palestinian Exodus of 1948". ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', vol. 16, no. 4. (Summer, 1987), p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt; records are available from archives and diaries which while not revealing a specific plan or precise orders for expulsion, they provide overwhelming circumstantial evidence to show that a design was being implemented by the Haganah, and later by the IDF, to reduce the number of Arabs in the Jewish state to a minimum and to make use of most of their lands, properties, and habitats to absorb the masses of Jewish immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, A. (1948): ''In the Face of the Arab Evacuation''. Hebrew, ''L'AMut Haauodah'', January 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Michael Bar-Zohar, appeals to "the Arabs to stay" were political gestures for external audiences whereas "[i]n internal discussions", Ben-Gurion communicated that "it was better that the smallest possible number of Arabs remain within the area of the state."&lt;ref&gt;Michael Bar-Zohar (1977): ''Ben-Gurion: A Political Biography''. Hebrew, Tel Aviv, vol. 2, pp. 702–3.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flapan quotes Ben-Gurion several times in order to prove this basic stand:
* After the flight of the Arabs began Ben-Gurion himself wrote in his diary, "We must afford civic and human equality to every Arab who remains, [but, he insisted,] it is not our task to worry about the return of the Arabs."&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Gurion, David (1982): ''War Diaries''. Ed. G. Rivlin and E. Orren in Hebrew, Tel Aviv, 1 May 1948, p. 382. Cited in Flapan, Simha (1987): "The Palestinian Exodus of 1948". ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', vol. 16, no. 4. (Summer, 1987), p. 4.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 11 May Ben-Gurion noted that he had given orders "for the destruction of Arab islands in Jewish population areas".&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Gurion: ''War Diaries'', 11 May 1948, p. 409. Cited in Flapan, Simha (1987): "The Palestinian Exodus of 1948". ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', vol. 16, no. 4. (Summer, 1987), pp. 3–26.&lt;/ref&gt;
* During the early years of the state, Ben-Gurion stated that "the Arabs cannot accept the existence of Israel. Those who accept it are not normal. The best solution for the Arabs in Israel is to go and live in the Arab states—in the framework of a peace treaty or transfer."&lt;ref&gt;Report to Mapam political committee, 14 March 1951, by Riftin, MGH. Cited in Flapan, Simha (1987): "The Palestinian Exodus of 1948". ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', vol. 16, no. 4. (Summer, 1987), pp. 6, 23–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Nur Masalha also gives several quotes of Ben-Gurion supporting it:
* On 7 February 1948, commenting on the de-Arabisation of parts of Western Jerusalem he told the Mapai Council: "What happened in Jerusalem ... is likely to happen in many parts of the country ... in six, eight or ten months of the campaign there will certainly be great changes in the composition of the population in the country."&lt;ref&gt;Masalha, pp. 180–181.&lt;/ref&gt;
* On 6 April he told the Zionist Actions Committee: "We will not be able to win the war if we do not, during the war, populate upper and lower, eastern and western Galilee, the Negev and Jerusalem area.... I believe that war will also bring in its wake a great change in the distribution of the Arab population."&lt;ref&gt;Masalha (1992), p. 181.&lt;/ref&gt;

Flapan&lt;ref&gt;Flapan, Simha (1987): "The Palestinian Exodus of 1948". ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', vol. 16, no. 4. (Summer, 1987), p. 17.&lt;/ref&gt; considers that "hand in hand with measures to ensure the continued exodus of Arabs from Israel was a determination not to permit any of the refugees to return. He claims that all of the Zionist leaders (Ben-Gurion, Sharett, and Weizmann) agreed on this point."

Rabbi Chaim Simons (Ph.D) made an exhaustive survey of references to the Transfer of Arabs by Zionists and others over half a century.&lt;ref name=Simons&gt;Chaim Simons (2004) A Historical Survey of Proposals to Transfer Arabs from Palestine 1895 - 1947 [https://www.scribd.com/doc/12589479/Chaim-Simons-A-Historical-Survey-of-Proposals-to-Transfer-Arabs-From-Palestine-18951947]&lt;/ref&gt; In the introduction he writes: "I soon discovered that it was not just "a few stray statements" but that the transfer of Arabs from Palestine was definite policy not only of the Zionist leaders, but also of many leading individual non-Jews". He concludes (page 298):
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Most leaders of the Zionist movement publicly opposed such transfers. However, a study of their confidential correspondence, private diaries and minutes of closed meetings, made available to the public under the "thirty year rule", reveals the true feelings of the Zionist leaders on the transfer question. We see from this classified material that Herzl, Ben-Gurion, Weizmann, Sharett and Ben-Zvi, to mention just a few, were really in favour of transferring the Arabs from Palestine. Attempts to hide transfer proposals made by past Zionist leaders has led to a "rewriting of history" and the censoring and amending of official documents!"&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his Epilogue, Simons makes it clear that he has sympathy for the transfer concept:&lt;ref&gt;Chaim Simons (2004)A Historical Survey of Proposals to Transfer Arabs from Palestine 1895 - 1947. Epilogue.[http://chaimsimons.net/transfer31.html]&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;In conclusion, we can say that in general, the various proposals for the transfer of the Arabs from Palestine were intended to remove the friction, either present or future, resulting from an Arab minority in a Jewish State and to enable each nation to live amongst its own people. It was considered, that after the initial trauma of transfer, both Arabs and Jews would live unmolested by each other in their own States&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Criticisms of the "Transfer Idea"===
The "transfer principle" theory was attacked by [[Efraim Karsh]]. Karsh argued that transferist thinking was a fringe philosophy within Zionism, and had no significant effect on expulsions. He gives two specific points of criticism:
* Karsh cites evidence supporting the idea that Ben-Gurion and the Jewish Agency Executive (JAE) did not agree on transfer of Palestinian Arabs but rather had a much more tolerant vision of Arab-Jewish coexistence:
**Ben-Gurion's at a JAE meeting in 1936: "We do not deny the right of the Arab inhabitants of the country, and we do not see this right as a hindrance to the realization of Zionism".&lt;ref&gt;"Protocol of the Meeting of the Jewish Agency Executive, held in Jerusalem on Nov. 1, 1936", CZA, p. 7.&lt;/ref&gt;
**Ben-Gurion to his party members: "In our state there will be non-Jews as well—and all of them will be equal citizens; equal in everything without any exception; that is: the state will be their state as well".&lt;ref&gt;David Ben-Gurion, ''Ba-ma'araha'', vol. IV, part 2 (Tel Aviv: ''Misrad Ha'bitahon'', 1959), p. 260.&lt;/ref&gt;
**in an October 1941 internal policy paper: "Jewish immigration and colonization in Palestine on a large scale can be carried out without displacing Arabs", and: "in a Jewish Palestine the position of the Arabs will not be worse than the position of the Jews themselvesé.&lt;ref&gt;David Ben-Gurion, "Outlines of Zionist Policy—Private and Confidential", 15 Oct 1941, CZA Z4/14632, p. 15 (iii &amp; iv).&lt;/ref&gt;
**explicit instructions of Israel Galili, the Haganah's commander-in-chief: "acknowledgement of the full rights, needs, and freedom of the Arabs in the Hebrew state without any discrimination, and a desire for coexistence on the basis of mutual freedom and dignity".&lt;ref&gt;Rama to brigade commanders, "Arabs Residing in the Enclaves", 24 Mar. 1948, Haganah Archives 46/109/5.&lt;/ref&gt;
* According to Karsh there was never any Zionist attempt to inculcate the "transfer" idea in the hearts and minds of Jews. He could find no evidence of any press campaign, radio broadcasts, public rallies, or political gatherings, for none existed. Furthermore, in Karsh's opinion the idea of transfer was forced on the Zionist agenda by the British (in the recommendations of the 1937 Peel Royal Commission on Palestine) rather than being self-generated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Karsh|first= Efraim |date= June 1996|title= Rewriting Israel's History.

=="Master Plan" explanation==
&lt;!-- Image with unknown copyright status removed: [[Image:WalidKhalidi.jpg|thumb|right|Palestinian historian [[Walid Khalidi]], who had proposed the "Master Plan" Theory]] --&gt;
Based on the aforementioned alleged prevalent idea of transfer, and on actual expulsions that took place in the [[1948 Arab–Israeli war]], Walid Khalidi, a Palestinian historian, introduced a thesis in 1961 according to which the Palestinian exodus was planned in advance by the Zionist leadership.&lt;ref name="W. Khalidi 1961"/&gt;

Khalidi based his thesis on [[Plan Dalet]], a plan devised by the Haganah high command in March 1948, which stipulated, among other things that if Palestinians in villages controlled by the Jewish troops resist, they should be expelled (Khalidi, 1961). Plan Dalet was aimed to establish Jewish sovereignty over the land allocated to the Jews by the United Nations (Resolution 181), and to prepare the ground toward the expected invasion of Palestine by Arab states after the imminent establishment of the state of Israel. In addition, it was introduced while Jewish–Palestinian fighting was already underway and while thousands of Palestinians had already fled. Nevertheless, Khalidi argued that the plan was a master-plan for the expulsion of the Palestinians from the territories controlled by the Jews. He argued that there was an omnipresent understanding during the war that as many [[Palestinian Arab]]s as possible had to be transferred out of the [[Jewish state]], and that this understanding stood behind many of the expulsions that the commanders in the field carried out.

In the opinion of Glazer (1980, p.&amp;nbsp;113), there is evidence that Zionist leaders were already thinking about removal of the Palestinian population before the actual occurrence. On 7 February 1948, Ben-Gurion told the Central Committee of Mapai (the largest Zionist political party in Palestine) "it is most probable that in the 6, 8 or 10 coming months of the struggle many great changes will take place, very great in this country and not all of them to our disadvantage, and surely a great change in the composition of the population in the country."&lt;ref&gt;Ben-Gurion is quoted in Gabbay, Roney (1959): ''A Political Study of the Arab–Jewish Conflict''. Geneva: Librarie E. Doz, p. 110.&lt;/ref&gt; Glazer (1980, p.&amp;nbsp;113) states that the 1947 Partition Resolution awarded an area to the Jewish state whose population was 46 percent Arab and where much of this land was owned by Arabs. He considers that "it has been argued by the Zionists that they were prepared to make special accommodations for this large population; yet it is difficult to see how such accommodations could have coalesced with their plans for large-scale Jewish immigration; moreover, by 1 August 1948, the Israeli government had already stated that it was 'economically unfeasible' to allow the return of the Arabs, at the very time when Jewish refugees were already entering the country and being settled on abandoned Arab property."

According to [[Ilan Pappé]], the Palestinian exodus can be described as ethnic cleansing. In his book ''[[The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine]]'' Pappé analyses the causes of the exodus. He describes the aims the Yishuv (the Jewish community in Palestine) had, the way it prepared in the years before the war to be able to achieve these aims and the way in which a pragmatic ethnic cleansing policy was devised and implemented in 1947–1949.

===Planning by Ben-Gurion and the ''Consultancy''===
According to Flapan "the Jewish army ... under the leadership of Ben-Gurion, planned and executed the expulsion in the wake of the UN Partition Resolution."&lt;ref name="Simha Flapan 1987, p. 3-26"&gt;[[Simha Flapan]], 1987, "The Palestinian Exodus of 1948", ''J. Palestine Studies'' 16 (4), pp. 3–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

Pappé gives more details of this planning process. According to Pappé&lt;ref&gt;I. Pappé, 2006, ''The ethnic cleansing of Palestine'', pp. 23–28.&lt;/ref&gt; Ben-Gurion was the architect of the ethnic cleansing of the Palestinians. "His central role in deciding the fate of the Palestinians stemmed from the complete control he exercised over all issues of security and defence in the Jewish community in Palestine." In 1947 Ben-Gurion created what Pappé calls the "Consultancy". This was a group of eleven people, a combination of military and security figures and specialists on Arab affairs. From October 1947 this group met weekly to discuss issues of security and strategy towards the Arab world and the Palestinians.&lt;ref&gt;Pappé, pp. 37, 38.&lt;/ref&gt;

At a meeting on 10 March the consultancy put the final touches on [[Plan Dalet]],&lt;ref&gt;Pappé, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt; according to Pappé the blueprint for the ethnic cleansing of Palestine. According to Plan Dalet a Palestinian village was to be expelled if it was located on a strategic spot or if it put up some sort of resistance when it was occupied by Yishuv forces. According to Pappé "it was clear that occupation would always provoke some resistance and that therefore no village would be immune, either because of its location or because it would not allow itself to be occupied."&lt;ref&gt;Pappé, p. 82.&lt;/ref&gt; After 15 May the Consultancy started meeting less frequently because according to Pappé "ever since Plan Dalet had been put into motion it had been working well, and needed no further coordination and direction."&lt;ref&gt;Pappé, p. 131.&lt;/ref&gt;

However, according to Gelber, [[Plan Dalet]] instructions were: In case of resistance, the population of conquered villages was to be expelled outside the borders of the Jewish state. If no resistance was met, the residents could stay put, under military rule.&lt;ref name="gelber2006p306"&gt;{{cite book|author=Yoav Gelber|title=Palestine 1948: War, Escape And The Emergence Of The Palestinian Refugee Problem| url=https://books.google.com/books?id=UcSUgrDsD_sC|accessdate=13 July 2013|date=1 January 2006|publisher=Sussex Academic Press|isbn=978-1-84519-075-0|pages=306| quote="the method for taking over an Arab village:  Surround the village and search it (for weapons). In case of resistance — … expel the population beyond the border... If there is no resistance, a garrison should be stationed in the village. . . appoint local institutions for administering the village internal affairs. The text clarified unequivocally that expulsion concerned only those villages that would fight against the Hagana and resist occupation, and not all Arab hamlets."}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During a September 1948 meeting of the Israeli cabinet, Ben-Gurion proposed ending the current ceasefire.&lt;ref name=Segev2013/&gt;  His reasons remained classified when the cabinet minutes were released, but revealed by [[Tom Segev]] in 2013:
&lt;blockquote&gt;If war broke out, we would then be able to clear the entire central Galilee with one fell swoop. But we cannot empty the central Galilee - that is, including the [Arab] refugees - without a war going on. The Galilee is full of [Arab] residents; it is not an empty region. If war breaks out throughout the entire country, this would be advantageous for us as far as the Galilee is concerned because, without having to make any major effort - we could use just enough of the force required for the purpose without weakening our military efforts in other parts of the country - we could empty the Galilee completely.&lt;ref name=Segev2013&gt;{{cite news | author = Tom Segev | title = Will we ever find out what the censor left out? | newspaper = Haaretz | date = March 16, 2013 | accessdate = March 16, 2013 | url = http://www.haaretz.com/weekend/the-makings-of-history/will-we-ever-find-out-what-the-censor-left-out.premium-1.509647 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
However, the proposal was not passed by the cabinet.&lt;ref name=Segev2013/&gt;

===Role of the Yishuv's official decision-making bodies===
Flapan says that "it must be understood that official Jewish decision-making bodies (the provisional government, the National Council, and the Jewish Agency Executive) neither discussed nor approved a design for expulsion, and any proposal of the sort would have been opposed and probably rejected. These bodies were heavily influenced by liberal, progressive labor, and socialist Zionist parties. The Zionist movement as a whole, both the left and the right, had consistently stressed that the Jewish people, who had always suffered persecution and discrimination as a national and religious minority, would provide a model of fair treatment of minorities in their own state."&lt;ref name = "Simha-1987-p6"&gt;Flapan, p. 6.&lt;/ref&gt; The author later maintains that "once the flight began, however, Jewish leaders encouraged it. Sharett, for example, immediately declared that no mass return of Palestinians to Israel would be permitted."&lt;ref&gt;Sharett to Zaslani (Shiloah), 26 April 1948, PDD, doc. 410, 674; Sharett to John MacDonald (U.S. consul in Jerusalem), UN Weekly Bulletin, 28 October 1947, 565. Cited in Flapan, Simha (1987): "The Palestinian Exodus of 1948". ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', vol. 16, no. 4. (Summer, 1987), pp. 3–26.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Flapan "[Aharon] Cohen (head of Mapam's Arab department) insisted in October 1948 that 'the Arab exodus was not part of a preconceived plan.' But, he acknowledged, 'a part of the flight was due to official policy.... Once it started, the flight received encouragement from the most important Jewish sources, for both military and political reasons.'"&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, report to Mapam political committee, October 1948, MGH. Cited in Flapan, pp. 3–26.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Criticisms of "Master Plan" explanation===
Historians skeptical of the "Master Plan" emphasize that no central directive has surfaced from the archives and argue that, had such an understanding been widespread, it would have left a mark in the vast documentation produced by the Zionist leadership at the time. Furthermore, [[Yosef Weitz]], who was strongly in favor of expulsion, had explicitly asked Ben-Gurion for such a directive and was turned down. Finally, settlement policy guidelines drawn up between December 1947 and February 1948, designed to handle the absorption of the anticipated first million immigrants, planned for some 150 new settlements, of which about half were located in the Negev, while the remainder were sited along the lines of the UN partition map (29 November 1947) in the north and centre of the country.

''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East'' states that "recent studies, based on official Israeli archives, have shown that there was no official policy or instructions to bring about the expulsion."&lt;ref name="Efrat" /&gt; According to Efraim Karsh:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Israeli forces did on occsasion expel Palestinians. But this accounted for only a small fraction of the total exodus, occurred not within the framework of a premeditated plan but in the heat of battle, and was dictated predominantly by military [[ad hoc]] considerations (notably the need to deny strategic sites to the enemy if there were no available Jewish forces to hold them).... Indeed, even the largest expulsions, during the battle for [[Lod|Lydda]] in July 1948, emanated from a string of unexpected developments on the ground and in no way foreseen in military plans for the capture of the town.&lt;ref name="KarshEssential" /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

New historian [[Avi Shlaim]] considers that the Plan Dalet is not a policy of expulsion but is a military plan dedicated to secure areas allocated to Jewish state.&lt;ref&gt;[[Avi Shlaim]], ''The Iron Wall'', p. 31.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Benny Morris]] considers that there was no master plan nor ethnic cleansing.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theatlantic.com/doc/200403u/int2004-03-25 Interview of Benny Morris, 25 March 2004].&lt;/ref&gt; Morris wrote, "[T]he fact ... that during 1948 Ben-Gurion and most of the Yishuv's leaders wished to see as few Arabs remaining as possible, does not mean that the Yishuv adopted and implemented a policy of expulsion."&lt;ref&gt;Benny Moris, 1991, "Response to Finkelstein and Masalha", ''J. Palestine Studies'' 21(1) pp. 98–114.&lt;/ref&gt; He later expounded:
&lt;blockquote&gt;There was no Zionist "plan" or blanket policy of evicting the Arab population, or of "ethnic cleansing". Plan Dalet (Plan D), of 10 March 1948, (it is open and available for all to read in the IDF Archive and in various publications), was the master plan of the Haganah—the Jewish military force that became the Israel Defense Forces (IDF)—to counter the expected pan-Arab assault on the emergent Jewish state.&lt;ref name="Fact"&gt;Benny Morris, "Benny Morris on fact, fiction, &amp; propaganda about 1948", ''The Irish Times'', 21 February 2008, [http://jeffweintraub.blogspot.com/2008/02/benny-morris-on-fact-fiction-propaganda.html reported by Jeff Weintraub] {{webarchive |url=https://www.webcitation.org/5j0sy4bPE?url=http://jeffweintraub.blogspot.com/2008/02/benny-morris-on-fact-fiction-propaganda.html |date=2009-08-14 }}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In his 2004 book, ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited'', Morris wrote, "My feeling is that the transfer thinking and near-consensus that emerged in the 1930s and early 1940s was not tantamount to pre-planning and did not issue in the production of a policy or master-plan of expulsion; the Yishuv and its military forces did not enter the 1948 War, which was initiated by the Arab side, with a policy or plan for expulsion."&lt;ref name="Morris 2004, p. 60"/&gt; Morris also states that he could not find anything in the Israeli archives that would prove the existence of a Zionist plan to expel Palestinians in 1948. Elsewhere Morris has said that the expulsion of the Palestinians did amount to ethnic cleansing, and that the action was justifiable considering the circumstances.&lt;ref name = "Morris-20080108"/&gt;

[[Yoav Gelber]] notes that documentation exists&lt;ref&gt;Protocol of Ben-Gurion's consultation with the Haganah's high command, 9 January 1948 and his speech of 6 April 1948 at the meeting of the Zionist Action Committee.&lt;/ref&gt; showing that [[David Ben-Gurion]] "regarded the escape as a calculated withdrawal of non-combatant population upon the orders of Arab commanders and out of military considerations", which is contradictory to the hypothesis of a master plan he may have drawn up.&lt;ref&gt;Gelber, p. 81.&lt;/ref&gt;

Concerning the [[Plan Dalet]], Gelber argues that Khalidi and Pappe's interpretation relies only on a single paragraph in a document of 75 pages, that has been taken out of its context.&lt;ref&gt;Gelber, p. 303.&lt;/ref&gt; Describing the plan in reference to the announced intervention of the Arab armies, he argues that "it was a practical response to an emerging threat."&lt;ref&gt;Gelber, p. 304.&lt;/ref&gt; Gelber also argues that the occupation and destruction of Arab villages described in the paragraph quoted in Khalidi's paper had the military purpose of preventing Arabs from cutting roads facilitating incursions by Arab armies, while eliminating villages that might have served as bases for attacking Jewish settlements.&lt;ref&gt;Gelber, p. 305.&lt;/ref&gt; He also remarks that if Master Plan had been one dedicated to resolving the Arab question, it would have been written by Ben-Gurion's advisors on Arab affairs and by military officers under the supervision of the chief-of-staff [[Yigael Yadin]].&lt;ref&gt;The plan was written by Ber and Pasternak; see Gelber, p. 306.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[:fr:Henry Laurens|Henry Laurens]] raises several objections to the views of those he calls the "intentionalists". Like Morris and Gelber he says that Plan Dalet obeyed a military logic, arguing that if it had not been followed, the strategic situation, particularly around Tel Aviv would have been as critical as that which existed around Jerusalem during the war.&lt;ref&gt;Henry Laurens, quoted in Eugene Rogan and Avi Shlaim, French Edition (2002), p. 236.&lt;/ref&gt;

Laurens cites some examples of events that indicate a contradiction in the "intentionalist" analysis. Like Gelber, he points out that Zionist authors at the beginning of the exodus considered it to be part and parcel of a "diabolic British plan" devised to impede the creation of the Jewish state.&lt;ref&gt;Laurens, quoted in Rogan and Shlaim, p. 234.&lt;/ref&gt; He also emphasizes that even those who had always advocated the Arab expulsion, like e.g. [[Yosef Weitz]], had done nothing to prepare for it in advance, and thus found it necessary to improvise the "other transfer", the one dealing with transfer of Arab properties to Jewish institutions.&lt;ref&gt;Laurens, quoted in Rogan and Shlaim, p. 239.&lt;/ref&gt;

Globally Laurens also considers that the "intentionalism" thesis is untenable in the global context of the events and lacks historical methodology. He insists that, were the events the "intentionalists" put forward true, they are so only in terms of ''a priori'' reading of those events. To comply with such an analysis, the protagonists should have had a global consciousness of all the consequences of the project they promoted. Laurens considers that a "complot theory", on such a long time period, could not have been planned, even by a Ben-Gurion. In an "intentionalist" approach, he claims, events must be read without ''a priori'' and each action must be considered without assuming it will lead to where we know ''a posteriori'' it led but it must be considered in its context and in taking into account where the actors thought it would lead.

Laurens considers that with an appropriate approach the documentation gathered by Morris shows that the exodus was caused by mutual fears of the other side's intentions, Arabs fearing to be expelled by Zionists and in reaction Zionists fearing Arabs would prevent them by force to build their own state, and the fact that Palestine was not able to absorb both populations (he describes the situation as a [[zero-sum]] conflict).&lt;ref&gt;Laurens, quoted in Rogan and Shlaim, p. 238.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Morris's ''Four Waves'' analysis==
In ''The Irish Times'' of February 2008, Benny Morris summarized his analysis as follows: "Most of Palestine's 700,000 "refugees" fled their homes because of the flail of war (and in the expectation that they would shortly return to their homes on the backs of victorious Arab invaders). But it is also true that there were several dozen sites, including Lydda and Ramla, from which Arab communities were expelled by Jewish troops."&lt;ref name="Fact" /&gt; In ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited'', Morris divided the Palestinian exodus in four waves and an aftermath:&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2004, pp. vii, 590.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris analyses the direct causes, as opposed to his proposed indirect cause of the "transfer idea", for each wave separately.

===Causes of the first wave, December 1947 – March 1948===
Morris gives no numbers regarding the first wave, but says "the spiral of violence precipitated flight by the middle and upper classes of the big towns, especially Haifa, Jaffa and Jerusalem, and their satellite rural communities. It also prompted the piecemeal, but almost complete, evacuation of the Arab rural population from what was to be the heartland of the Jewish State—the Coastal Plain between Tel Aviv and Hadera—and a small-scale partial evacuation of other rural areas hit by hostilities and containing large Jewish concentrations, namely the Jezreel and Jordan valleys."&lt;ref name="morris138"&gt;Morris 2004, p. 138.&lt;/ref&gt;
More specific to the causes Morris states: "The Arab evacuees from the towns and villages left largely because of Jewish ... attacks or fear of impending attack, and from a sense of vulnerability."&lt;ref name="morris138" /&gt;
According to Morris expulsions were "almost insignificant" and "many more left as a result of orders or advice from Arab military commanders and officials" to safer areas within the country. The Palestinian leadership struggled against the exodus.&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2004, p. 139.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Causes of the second wave, April–June 1948===
According to Morris the "Haganah and IZL offensives in Haifa, Jaffa and eastern and western Galilee precipitated a mass exodus."&lt;ref name="morris263"&gt;Morris 2004, p. 263.&lt;/ref&gt; "Undoubtedly ... the most important single factor in the exodus of April–June was Jewish attack. This is demonstrated clearly by the fact that each exodus occurred during or in the immediate wake of military assault. No town was abandoned by the bulk of its population before the main Haganah/IZL assault."&lt;ref name="morris265"&gt;Morris 2004, p. 265.&lt;/ref&gt; Also many villages were abandoned during attacks, but others were evacuated because the inhabitants feared they would be next.&lt;ref name="morris265" /&gt; A major factor in the exodus was the undermining of Palestinian morale due to the earlier fall and exodus from other towns and villages.&lt;ref name="morris263" /&gt;
Morris says that the "Palestinian leaders and commanders struggled against [the exodus]" but in many cases encouraged evacuation of women children and old people out of harms way and in some cases ordered villages to evacuate.&lt;ref name="morris263" /&gt;

Regarding expulsions (Morris defines expulsions as "when a Haganah/IDF/IZL/LHI unit entered or conquered a town or village and then ordered its inhabitants to leave")&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 1991, "Response to Finkelstein and Masalha", ''J. Palestine Studies'', 21 (1), pp. 98–114.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris says that the Yishuv leaders "were reluctant to openly order or endorse expulsions" in towns but "Haganah commanders exercised greater independence and forcefulness in the countryside": "In general Haganah operational orders for attacks on towns did not call for the expulsion or eviction of the civilian population. But from early April, operational orders for attacks on villages and clusters of villages more often than not called for the destruction of villages and, implicitly or explicitly, expulsion." Issuing expulsion orders was hardly necessary though, because "most villages were completely or almost completely empty by the time they were conquered",&lt;ref name="morris265" /&gt; "the inhabitants usually fled with the approach of the advancing Jewish column or when the first mortar bombs began to hit their homes."&lt;ref&gt;Benny Moris, 1991, "Response to Finkelstein and Masalha", ''J. Palestine Studies'' 21(1) pp. 98-114.&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Givati Brigade]] engaged in expulsions near Rehovot.

{{Further|1948 Palestinian exodus from Lydda and Ramle}}
In July "altogether, the Israeli offensives of the ''Ten Days'' and the subsequent clearing operations probably send something over 100,000 Arabs into exile."&lt;ref name="morris448"&gt;Morris 2004, p. 448.&lt;/ref&gt; About half of these were expelled from Lydda and Ramle on 12 through 14 July. Morris says that expulsion orders were given for both towns, the one for Ramle calling for "sorting out of the inhabitants, and send the army-age males to a prisoner-of-war camp".&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2004, p. 429.&lt;/ref&gt; "The commanders involved understood that what was happening was an expulsion rather than a spontaneous exodus."&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2004, p. 432.&lt;/ref&gt;

In October and November Operations Yoav in the Negev and Hiram in central Galilee were aimed at destroying enemy formations of respectively the Egyptian army and the Arab Liberation Army, and precipitated the flight of 200,000–230,000 Arabs.&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2004, pp. 490, 492.&lt;/ref&gt; The UN mediator on Palestine [[Folke Bernadotte]] reported in September 1948 that Palestinian flight, "resulted from panic created by fighting in their communities, by rumours concerning real or alleged acts of terrorism, or expulsion".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/AB14D4AAFC4E1BB985256204004F55FA |title=Progress report of the United Nations Mediator on Palestine submitted to the Secretary-General for transmission to the members of the United Nations |publisher=United Nations Mediator on Palestine |date=16 September 1948 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100605160815/http://unispal.un.org/UNISPAL.NSF/0/AB14D4AAFC4E1BB985256204004F55FA |archivedate=5 June 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[United Nations]] observers, who had been dispatched to monitor how the [[United Nations Partition Plan for Palestine|partition plan]], reported in October that Israeli policy was that of "uprooting Arabs from their native villages in Palestine by force or threat".&lt;ref&gt;United Nations Archives, 13/3.3.1 Box 11, Atrocities September–November. Cited in ''The Ethnic Cleansing of Palestine'', Ilan Pappé, {{ISBN|9781851685554}}, p. 190.&lt;/ref&gt; In the Negev the clearing was more complete because "the OC, Allon, was known to want "Arab-clean" areas along his line of advance" and "his subordinates usually acted in accordance"&lt;ref name="morris490"&gt;Morris 2004, p. 490.&lt;/ref&gt; and the inhabitants were almost uniformly Muslim. In the Galilee pocket, for various reasons, about 30–50 per cent of the inhabitants stayed.&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2004, p. 491.&lt;/ref&gt;
More specifically regarding the causes of the exodus Morris says: "Both commanders were clearly bent on driving out the population in the area they were conquering," and "Many, perhaps most, [Arabs] expected to be driven out, or worse. Hence, when the offensives were unleashed, there was a 'coalescence' of Jewish and Arab expectations, which led, especially in the south, to spontaneous flight by most of the inhabitants. And, on both fronts, IDF units 'nudged' Arabs into flight and expelled communities."&lt;ref name="morris490" /&gt;

==Two-stage analysis==
The "Two-stage explanation" brought forth by Yoav Gelber [http://hnn.us/articles/782.html] synthetises the events of 1948 in distinguishing two phases in the exodus. Before the first truce (11 June – 8 July 1948), it explains the exodus as a result of the crumbling Arab social structure that was not ready to withstand a civil war, and justified Jewish military conduct. After the truce the IDF launched counter offensives against the invading forces. Gelber explains the exodus in this stage as a result of expulsions and massacres performed by the Israeli army during Operation Dani and the campaign in the Galilee and Negev.

===First Stage: The crumbling of Arab Palestinian social structure===
Gelber describes the exodus before July 1948 as being initially mainly due to the inability of the Palestinian social structure to withstand a state of war :

:Mass flight accompanied the fighting from the beginning of the civil war. In the absence of proper military objectives, the antagonists carried out their attacks on non-combatant targets, subjecting civilians of both sides to deprivation, intimidation and harassment. Consequently, the weaker and backward Palestinian society collapsed under a not-overly-heavy strain. Unlike the Jews, who had nowhere to go and fought with their back to the wall, the Palestinians had nearby shelters. From the beginning of hostilities, an increasing flow of refugees drifted into the heart of Arab-populated areas and into adjacent countries.... The Palestinians' precarious social structure tumbled because of economic hardships and administrative disorganization. Contrary to the Jews who built their "State in the Making" during the mandate period, the Palestinians had not created in time substitutes for the government services that vanished with the British withdrawal. The collapse of services, the lack of authority and a general feeling of fear and insecurity generated anarchy in the Arab sector.
:Early in April, the Haganah launched several large-scale operations across the country.
:In the last six weeks of the British mandate, the Jews occupied most of the area that the UN partition plan allotted to their State. They took over five towns and 200 villages; between 250,000 and 300,000 Palestinians and other Arabs ran away (so far, they were not driven out) to Palestine's Arab sectors and to neighboring countries.
:Unlike the pre-invasion period, certain Israeli Defense Force (IDF) actions on the eve of and after the invasion aimed at driving out the Arab population from villages close to Jewish settlements or adjacent to main roads. These measures appeared necessary in face of the looming military threat by the invading Arab armies. The Israelis held the Palestinians responsible for the distress that the invasion caused and believed they deserved severe punishment. The local deportations of May–June 1948 appeared both militarily vital and morally justified. Confident that their conduct was indispensable, the troops did not attempt to conceal harsh treatment of civilians in their after-action reports.&lt;ref&gt;Y. Gelber, 2002, "Why Did The Palestinians Run Away in 1948?", George Mason University's History News Network [http://hnn.us/articles/782.html].&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Efraim Karsh]] in April 1948 "some 100,000 Palestinians, mostly from the main urban centres of [[Jaffa]], [[Haifa]], and Jerusalem and from villages in the coastal plain, had gone. Within a month those numbers had nearly doubled; and by early June, ... some 390,000 Palestinians had left."&lt;ref name="KarshEssential"/&gt; 30,000 Arabs, mostly intellectuals and members of the social elite, had fled Palestine in the months following the approval of the partition plan, undermining the social infrastructure of Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;Sachar.{{page needed|date=July 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; A 10 May 1948 ''Time'' magazine article states: "Said one British official in Jerusalem last week: 'The whole [[effendi]] class has gone. It is remarkable how many of the younger ones are suddenly deciding that this might be a good time to resume their studies at Oxford....'"&lt;ref&gt;"Arrivals &amp; Departure", ''Time'' magazine, 10 May 1948.&lt;/ref&gt;

Other historians such as [[Efraim Karsh]], [[Avraham Sela]], Moshe Efrat, Ian J. Bickerton, Carla L. Klausner, and [[Howard Sachar]] share this analysis. In his interpretation of the second wave (Gelber's first ''stage''), as he names Israeli attacks (Operations Nachshon, Yiftah, Ben 'Ami, ...) Sachar considers Israeli attacks only as a secondary reason for flight, with the meltdown of the Palestinian society as the primary:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The most obvious reason for the mass exodus was the collapse of Palestine Arab political institutions that ensued upon the flight of the Arab leadership.... [O]nce this elite was gone, the Arab peasant was terrified by the likelihood of remaining in an institutional and cultural void. Jewish victories obviously intensified the fear and accelerated departure. In many cases, too ... Jews captured Arab villages, expelled the inhabitants, and blew up houses to prevent them from being used as strongholds against them. In other instances, Qawukji's men used Arab villages for their bases, provoking immediate Jewish retaliation.&lt;ref name = Sachar333&gt;Howard M. Sachar. ''A History of Israel from the Rise of Zionism to Our Time''. Published by Alfred A. Knopf. New York. 1976. p. 333. {{ISBN|0-394-48564-5}}.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Moshe Efrat of the [[Hebrew University of Jerusalem]] wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[R]ecent studies, based on official Israeli archives, have shown that there was no official policy or instructions intended to bring about the expulsion and that most of the Palestinians who became refugees had left their homes on their own initiative, before they came face to face with Israeli forces, especially in the period between late 1947 and June 1948. Later on, Israel's civil and military leadership became more decisive about preventing refugees from returning to their homes and more willing to resort to coercion in expelling the Palestine Arabs from their homes. This was not uniformly implemented in every sector and had much to do with decisions of local military commanders and circumstances, which might explain why some 156,000 Palestinians remained in Israel at the end of the war.&lt;ref name="Efrat"&gt;Efrat, Moshe. "Refugees". ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East''. Ed. [[Avraham Sela]]. New York: Continuum, 2002. p. 727.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In their book, ''A Concise History of the Arab–Israeli Conflict'', Ian J. Bicketon of the [[University of New South Wales]] and Carla L. Klausner of the [[University of Missouri–Kansas City]] go even further back in history by citing the British military response to the [[1936–1939 Arab revolt in Palestine|1936–1939 Arab revolt]] as the decisive moment when the Palestinian leadership and infrastructure began to crumble, and, in the most extreme cases, were expelled by the British from what was then the [[Mandatory Palestine|British Mandate for Palestine]]. Bickerton and Klausner conclude:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Palestinian leadership was absent just at the time when it was most needed. Further collapse occurred during 1947–1949, as many of the local mayors, judges, communal and religious officials fled. Palestinian society ... was semifeudal in character, and once the landlords and other leaders had made good their own escape—as they did from [[Haifa]], [[Jaffa]], [[Safed]], and elsewhere—the Arab townspeople, villagers, and [[fellahin|peasants]] were left helpless.&lt;ref name="Bickerton"&gt;Bickerton, Ian J., and Carla L. Klausner. ''A Concise History of the Arab–Israeli Conflict''. 4th ed. Upper Saddle River: Prentice Hall, 2002. pp. 104–106.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

===Second Stage: Israeli army victories and expulsions===
After the start of the Israeli counteroffensive, Gelber considers the exodus to have been a result of Israeli army's victory and the expulsion of Palestinians. He writes, "The Arab expeditions failed to protect them, and they remained a constant reminder of the fiasco. These later refugees were sometimes literally deported across the lines. In certain cases, IDF units terrorized them to hasten their flight, and isolated massacres particularly during the liberation of Galilee and the Negev in October 1948 expedited the flight."

Morris also reports expulsions during these events. For example, concerning whether in [[Operation Hiram]] there was a comprehensive and explicit expulsion order he replied:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Yes. One of the revelations in the book is that on 31 October 1948, the commander of the Northern Front, Moshe Carmel, issued an order in writing to his units to expedite the removal of the Arab population. Carmel took this action immediately after a visit by Ben-Gurion to the Northern Command in Nazareth. There is no doubt in my mind that this order originated with Ben-Gurion. Just as the expulsion order for the city of Lod, which was signed by Yitzhak Rabin, was issued immediately after Ben-Gurion visited the headquarters of [[Operation Dani]] [July 1948].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.logosjournal.com/morris.htm|title=ARI SHAVIT - SURVIVAL OF THE FITTEST? AN INTERVIEW WITH BENNY MORRIS: LOGOS WINTER 2004|website=www.logosjournal.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Gelber also underlines that Palestinian Arabs had certainly in mind the opportunity they would have to return their home after the conflict and that this hope must have eased their flight: "When they ran away, the refugees were confident of their eventual repatriation at the end of hostilities. This term could mean a cease-fire, a truce, an armistice and, certainly, a peace agreement. The return of escapees had been customary in the Middle East's wars throughout the ages".

Historian Christopher Sykes saw the causes of the Arab flight similar to Gelber:
&lt;blockquote&gt;It can be said with a high degree of certainty that most of the time in the first half of 1948 the mass-exodus was the natural, thoughtless, pitiful movement of ignorant people who had been badly led and who in the day of trial found themselves forsaken by their leaders. Terror was the impulse, by hearsay most often, and sometimes through experience as in the Arab port of Jaffa which surrendered on the 12th of May and where the Irgunists, to quote Mr. John Marlowe, "embellished their Deir Yassin battle honours by an orgy of looting". But if the exodus was by and large an accident of war in the first stage, in the later stages it was consciously and mercilessly helped on by Jewish threats and aggression towards Arab populations.&lt;ref&gt;''Cross Roads to Israel'', 1973.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Karsh views the second stage as being "dictated predominantly by ad hoc military considerations (notably the need to deny strategic sites to the enemy if there were no available Jewish forces to hold them)".&lt;ref name="KarshEssential" /&gt;

==Palestinian Arab fears==
In a 1958 publication, Don Peretz rejected both the Israeli and Palestinian explanations of the exodus. Peretz suggested that the exodus could be attributed to "deeper social causes of upheaval within the Palestine Arab community" such as the breakdown of all governing structures. According to him, "The community became easy prey to rumor and exaggerated [[Wiktionary:atrocity|atrocity]] stories. The psychological preparation for mass flight was complete. The hysteria fed upon the growing number of Jewish military victories. With most Arab leaders then outside the country, British officials no longer in evidence, and the disappearance of the Arab press, there remained no authoritative voice to inspire confidence among the Arab masses and to check their flight. As might be expected in such circumstances, the flight gathered momentum until it carried away nearly the whole of the Palestine Arab community"&lt;ref name = "Mendes-AJDS"/&gt;

In 1959, Rony Gabbay wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;The departure of the Arabs of Palestine from towns and villages during April - 15 May 1948 cannot be attributed to any specific reason. Rather, the exodus was the result of many diverse elements—psychological, military and political—which combined together to produce this phenomena. It was a result of the contradictory actions and reactions which destroyed all hopes in the hearts of the Arab population and urged them to flee aimlessly hither and thither. The way in which groups and even members of the same families fled, individually and in different directions can give us an idea of the degree of panic and horror which was felt amongst them."&lt;ref name = "Mendes-AJDS"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In their volume on the 1947–1948 period in Jerusalem and surrounding areas, ''[[O Jerusalem!]]'', [[Larry Collins (writer)|Larry Collins]] and [[Dominique Lapierre]] give a variety of explanations for the cause of the 1948 Palestinian exodus, but conclude, "Above all, fear and uncertainty fueled the Arabs' flight."&lt;ref&gt;[[Larry Collins (writer)|Collins, Larry]] and [[Dominique Lapierre]]. ''[[O Jerusalem!]]'' New York: Simon and Schuster, 1972. p. 337.&lt;/ref&gt; Middle East historian [[Karen Armstrong]] described a similar mechanism.&lt;ref&gt;[[Karen Armstrong|Armstrong, Karen]]. ''Jerusalem: One City, Three Faiths''. New York: Ballantine Books, 1996. pp. 389–390.&lt;/ref&gt; Schechtman, argues in his book ''The Arab Refugee Problem'' that a large part of the exodus was caused by Arab fear of attack, [[reprisal]], and the other stresses of war. Schechtman himself attributes this purely to the perspective of the refugees. He expounds this theory as follows:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Arab [[warfare]] against the Jews in Palestine ... had always been marked by indiscriminate killing, [[mutilation|mutilating]], [[raping]], [[looting]] and [[pillaging]]. This 1947–48 attack on the Jewish community was more savage than ever. Until the Arab armies invaded Israel on the very day of its birth, May 15, 1948, [[no quarter]] whatsoever had ever been given to a Jew who fell into Arab hands. Wounded and dead alike were mutilated. Every member of the Jewish community was regarded as an enemy to be mercilessly destroyed....&lt;br&gt;[T]he Arab population of Palestine anticipated nothing less than massacres in retaliation if the Jews were victorious. Measuring the Jewish reaction by their own standards, they simply could not imagine that the Jews would not reply in kind what they had suffered at Arab hands. And this fear played a significant role in the Arab flight.&lt;ref name=TheArabRefugeeProblem5-6&gt;''The Arab Refugee Problem'', Joseph B. Schectman, Philosophical Library, New York (1952), pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Schechtman also cites evidence that the Arab leaders spread rumors of atrocities that did not actually occur, which only added to the Palestinian Arabs' fears.&lt;ref&gt;Schechtman, Joseph B. ''The Arab Refugee Problem''. New York: Philosophical Library, 1952. p. 11.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Avraham Sela]], the Palestinian exodus began with news of the Zionists' military victories in April–May 1948:
&lt;blockquote&gt;[T]he offensive had a strong psychological effect on Palestinian-Arab villagers, whose tendency to leave under Jewish military pressure became a mass exodus.... [T]he exodus was a spontaneous movement, caused by an awareness of the Arab weakness and fear of annihilation typical in civil wars. Moreover, an early visible departure of nearly all the leadership was clearly understood as a signal, if not as an outright command.&lt;ref name="Sela"&gt;[[Avraham Sela|Sela, Avraham]]. "Arab–Israeli Conflict". ''The Continuum Political Encyclopedia of the Middle East''. Ed. Avraham Sela. New York: Continuum, 2002. pp. 58–121.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In his conclusions concerning the second wave of the flight, Morris also cites the ''[[Wiktionary:atrocity|atrocity]] factor'' as one of the causes. What happened or allegedly happened and in a more general way the [[massacre of Deir Yassin]] and its exaggerated description broadcast on Arab radio stations undermined Arabs' morale.&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris, ''The Birth of the Palestinian refugee problem revisited'', p. 264.&lt;/ref&gt; Yoav Gelber also considers that the "Haganah, IZL and LHI's retaliations terrified the Arabs and hastened the flight".&lt;ref name = "Gelber-p76"&gt;Yoav Gelber, ''Palestine 1948'', p. 76.&lt;/ref&gt; One Arab source at the time stated, "Had the Arab leaders not disseminated horrific stories about Deir Yasin the residents of the Arab areas in Palestine would not have run away from their homes."&lt;ref&gt;For quotations and their Arab sources, see Marie Syrkin, ''The Palestinians'' (Jerusalem, 1970), 4.  Qtd. in Nets-Zehngut, "Israel's Publications Agency and the 1948 Palestinian Refugees."&lt;/ref&gt;

Childers, while dismissing the fact that Arab leaders instigated the flight on radio broadcasts, points out that Zionist radio broadcasts were designed to demoralize the Arab audience.&lt;ref name = "Chiilders-p188"&gt;Childers: ''The Wordless Wish'', p. 188. On Zionist radio broadcasts from mid-April through mid-May and compared to Arab radio broadcasts urging calm and warning against flight.&lt;/ref&gt; The author cites the fact that rumours were spread by the Israeli forces that they possessed the atomic bomb.&lt;ref name = "Childers-p187"&gt;Childers: ''The Wordless Wish'', p. 187.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Khalidi points to what he describes as the Zionist "psychological offensive" which was highlighted by, though not limited to, radio messages warning the Arabs of [[disease]]s, the ineffectiveness of armed resistance and the incompetence of their leaders.&lt;ref name = "Khalidi-p21"&gt;Khalidi, W.(1959): "Why Did The Palestinians Leave?", ''Middle East Forum'', vol. XXXV, no. 7, pp. 21–24. Cited by Glazer (1980), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Psychological warfare==
The Yishuv used [[psychological warfare]] that initiated, accelerated and increased the Palestinian exodus. In many instances the declared aim was to demoralise the Palestinians or to accelerate their surrender. In many instances however the result was the flight of Palestinians. According to various historians the Yishuv engaged in various types of psychological warfare:

===Intimidation===
According to Pappé intimidation by various means was used. For instance in Haifa since December 1947 Jewish troops engaged in sniping, shelling, rolling barrels full of explosives and huge steel balls down into Palestinian neighborhoods and pouring oil mixed with fuel down the roads, which they then ignited.&lt;ref name = "Pappe-2006-p58"&gt;Pappé, p. 58.&lt;/ref&gt; Yoav Gelber considers that the "Haganah, IZL and LHI's retaliations terrified the Arabs and hastened the flight".&lt;ref name = "Gelber-p76"/&gt;

According to Pappé the Haganah engaged in what it called "violent reconnaissance": "Special units of the Haganah would enter villages looking for 'infiltrators' (read 'Arab volunteers') and distribute leaflets warning the people against cooperating with the Arab Liberation Army. Any resistance to such an incursion usually ended with the Jewish troops firing at random and killing several villagers."&lt;ref&gt;Pappé, pp. 55, 56.&lt;/ref&gt; Khalidi mentions "repeated and merciless raids against sleeping villages carried out in conformity with plan C", i.e. in the period before April 1948.&lt;ref name="W. Khalidi 1988, p. 4-33"&gt;W. Khalidi, "Plan Dalet: master plan for the conquest of Palestine", ''J. Palestine Studies'' 18 (1), 1988, pp. 4–33.&lt;/ref&gt;

In some cases threatening leaflets were distributed, containing wordings like: "if the war will be taken to your place, it will cause massive expulsion of the villagers, with their wives and children."&lt;ref&gt;Pappé, p. 56.&lt;/ref&gt;

Various authors give examples of instigation of whisper campaigns. Childers cites the fact that rumours were spread by the Israeli forces that they possessed the atomic bomb.&lt;ref name = "Childers-p187"/&gt; Morris cites Yigal Allon, the Palmach commander, describing such a campaign: "I gathered the Jewish mukhtars, who had ties with the different Arab villages, and I asked them to whisper in the ears of several Arabs that giant Jewish reinforcements had reached the Galilee and were about to clean out the villages of the Hula, [and] to advise them, as friends, to flee while they could. And the rumour spread throughout the Hula that the time had come to flee. The flight encompassed tens of thousands. The stratagem fully achieved its objective."&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2004, p. 251.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Broadcasts on radio and by loudspeaker vans===
Childers points out that Zionist radio broadcasts were designed to demoralize the Arab audience.On March 17, four days before the Jewish offensive, the Irgun made an Arabic-language broadcast, warning urban Arabs that "typhus, cholera and similar diseases would break out heavily among them in April and May".&lt;ref name = "Chiilders-p188"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erskine Childers, "The Other Exodus" in Laqueur, p. 184.&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Khalidi points to what he describes as the Zionist "psychological offensive" which was highlighted by, though not limited to, radio messages warning the Arabs of [[disease]]s, the ineffectiveness of armed resistance and the incompetence of their leaders.&lt;ref name = "Khalidi-p21"/&gt; According to Morris&lt;ref name = "Morris-2004-p191"&gt;Morris 2004, p. 191.&lt;/ref&gt; during the exodus of Haifa "The Haganah broadcasts called on the populace to 'evacuate the women, the children and the old immediately, and send them to a safe haven'."

During the exodus from Haifa according to Morris&lt;ref name = "Morris-2004-p191"/&gt; the Haganah made effective use of "Arab language broadcasts and loudspeaker vans" and according to Pappé&lt;ref name = "Pappe-2006-p58"/&gt; "Jewish loudspeakers [urged] the Palestinian women and children to leave before it was too late."

According to Morris during April the Haganah "had prepared and recorded six speeches, which were broadcast time and again by the Haganah's radio station and loudspeaker vans". They didn't call for Arab flight, but they "were designed to cause demoralisation—and the HGS\Operations proposed to 'exploit' this demoralisation (it didn't say how)".&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2004, p. 169.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shelling of civilians and fighters===
Khalidi illustrates the psychological warfare of the Haganah by the use of the [[Davidka]] mortar. He writes that it was a "favorite weapon of the Zionists", which they used against civilians: "the Davidka tossed a shell containing 60 lbs. of TNT usually into crowded built-up civilian quarters where the noise and blast maddened women and children into a frenzy of fear and panic."&lt;ref name="W. Khalidi 1988, p. 4-33"/&gt;

Various authors mention specific cases in which the Yishuv engaged in shelling of civilians:
* Morris says that during the battle of Tiberias the Haganah engaged in bombarding the Arab population with mortars&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2004, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;
* Morris says that during the exodus of Haifa a primary aim of mortar barrages was demoralisation: "The Haganah mortar attacks of 21–22 April were primarily designed to break Arab morale in order to bring about a swift collapse of resistance and speedy surrender.... But clearly the offensive, and especially the mortarring, precipitated the exodus. The three inch mortars 'opened up on the market square [where there was] a great crowd ... a great panic took hold. The multitude burst into the port, pushed aside the policemen, charged the boats and began to flee the town', as the official Haganah history later put it."&lt;ref&gt;Morris 2004, pp. 191, 200.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Pappé&lt;ref&gt;Pappé, p. 96.&lt;/ref&gt; this mortar barrage was deliberately aimed at civilians to precipitate their flight from Haifa.
* Nathan Krystall writes: "As a precursor to its attack on Qatamon, the Zionist forces subjected the neighborhood to weeks of heavy artillery shelling.

* In his report concerning the fall of Jaffa the local Arab military commander, Michel Issa, writes: "Continuous shelling with mortars of the city by Jews for four days, beginning 25 April, ... caused inhabitants of city, unaccustomed to such bombardment, to panic and flee."&lt;ref&gt;W. Khalidi, 1998, "Selected Documents on the 1948 Palestine War", ''J. Palestine Studies'' 27(3), pp. 60–105.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Morris the shelling was done by the Irgun. Their objective was "to prevent constant military traffic in the city, to break the spirit of the enemy troops [and] to cause chaos among the civilian population in order to create a mass flight".&lt;ref name="Morris 2004, p. 213"&gt;Morris 2004, p. 213.&lt;/ref&gt; High Commissioner Cunningham wrote a few days later "It should be made clear that IZL attack with mortars was indiscriminate and designed to create panic among the civilian inhabitants."&lt;ref name="Morris 2004, p. 213"/&gt;

===Massacres===
{{Main|Killings and massacres during the 1948 Palestine War}}

In his memoirs the Palestinian Arab physician Elias Srouji claims massacres were intended to scare inhabitants. He wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Tactics became even more brutal when the Zionists were ready to complete their occupation of the Galilee in October. By that time the Arab villagers, having seen what had happened elsewhere, had become adamant about staying put in their homes and on their lands. To frighten them away, the occupying forces started a strategy of planned massacres, which were carried out in Eilabun, Faradiyya, Safsaf, Sa'sa', and other villages. In places where this was not to their advantage for one reason or another, the army would resort to forceful expulsion. I was to wittnes some of these tactics in Rameh a month or so later.&lt;ref&gt;Elias Srouji, "The Last Days of 'Free Galilee': Memories of 1948", ''J. Palestine Studies'', 33(1), pp. 55–67.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Nathan Krystall writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;News of the attack on and [[massacre in Deir Yassin]] spread quickly throughout Palestine. De Reynier argued that the "general terror" was "astutely fostered by the Jews, with Haganah radio incessantly repeating 'Remember Deir Yassin' and loudspeaker vans broadcasting messages in Arabic such as: 'Unless you leave your homes, the fate of Deir Yassin will be your fate.'"&lt;ref name="Nathan Krystall 1998, p. 5-22"/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to Flapan, "from another perspective, [the Deir Yassin massacre] made perfect sense. More panic was sown among the Arab population by this operation than by anything that had happened up to then.... While Ben-Gurion condemned the massacre in no uncertain terms, he did nothing to curb the independent actions of the Jewish underground armies."&lt;ref name="Simha Flapan 1987, p. 3-26"/&gt;

=="Arab leaders' endorsement of flight" explanation==

===Explanations that the flight was instigated or caused by Arab leaders===
Israeli official sources, officials at the time, sympathetic accounts in the foreign press, and some historians have claimed that the refugee flight was instigated by Arab leaders, though almost invariably no primary sources were cited.&lt;ref name = Childers&gt;{{cite journal | journal = The Spectator | title = The Other Exodus | last = Childers | first = Erskine | date = 11 May 1961 | page = 8 | url = http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/12th-may-1961/8/the-other-exodus}}&lt;/ref&gt;   [[Yosef Weitz]] wrote in October 1948: "The migration of the Arabs from the [[Land of Israel]] was not caused by persecution, violence, expulsion ... [it was] a tactic of war on the part of the Arabs...."&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Benny. [https://www.jstor.org/pss/4283141 "Yosef Weitz and the Transfer Committees 1948–49"] ''JSTOR: Middle Eastern Studies'' vol. 22, no. 4 (Oct., 1986), p. 522.&lt;/ref&gt; Israeli historian Efraim Karsh wrote, "The logic behind this policy was apparently that 'the absence of women and children from Palestine would free the men for fighting', as the Secretary-General of the Arab League, [[Abd al-Rahman Azzam]] put it." In his book, ''The Arab–Israeli Conflict: The Palestine War 1948'', Karsh cited the substantial, active role the [[Arab Higher Committee]] played in the exoduses from [[Haifa]], [[Tiberias]], and [[Jaffa]] as an important part of understanding what he called the "birth of the Palestinian refugee problem".&lt;ref name="KarshEssential"&gt;[[Efraim Karsh|Karsh, Efraim]]. ''The Arab–Israeli Conflict: The Palestine War 1948''. Essential Histories. Oxford: Osprey Publishing, 2002. pp. 87–92.&lt;/ref&gt;

A 3 May 1948 ''Time'' magazine article attributed the exodus from the city of [[Haifa]] to fear, Arab orders to leave and a Jewish assault.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,798519,00.html?promoid=googlep "On the Eve?"] ''[[Time (magazine)|Time]]''. 3 May 1948. 22 September 2007.&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Economist]]'' attributed the exodus from Haifa to orders to leave from the Higher Arab Executive as well as expulsion by Jewish troops.&lt;ref&gt;''The Economist'', 2 October 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; According to Childers, the journalist responsible for the article was not present in Haifa, and he reported as an eyewitness account what was second-hand. The article is  only cited for this passage, though the same correspondent states therein that the second wave of destitute refugees, were given an hour by Jewish troops to quit the areas.&lt;ref name="Childers" /&gt; In what has become known as "The Spectator Correspondence", Hedley V. Cooke quote from Time Magazine (18 May 1961) "Mr, Ben-Gurion, the Israel (sic) Prime Minister. . . denied in the Knesset yesterday that a single Arab resident had been expelled by the Government since the establishment of the State of Israel and he said the pre-State Jewish underground had announced that any Arab would remain where he was. ''He said the fugitives had fled under the orders of Arab Leaders''".&lt;ref name=Spectator&gt;The Spectator Correspondence (May - August 1961). (This correspondence originally appeared as Appendix E in the Journal of Palestine Studies article “Plan Dalet Revisited’ by Walid Khalìdi in 18, no. 1 (Aut. 1988)) [http://www.palestine-studies.org/enakba/exodus/Erskine%20Childers,%20Walid%20Khalidi,%20Jon%20Kimche,%20et%20al.pdf] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20130510031106/http://www.palestine-studies.org/enakba/exodus/Erskine%20Childers%2C%20Walid%20Khalidi%2C%20Jon%20Kimche%2C%20et%20al.pdf |date=2013-05-10 }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the same "Spectator Correspondence" (page 54), Jon Kimche wrote "But there is now a mountain of independent evidence to show that the initiative for the Arab exodus came from the Arab side and not from the Jews".&lt;ref name=Spectator /&gt; In the same "Correspondence" the views of Ben-Gurion and Kimche are critiqued by Childers and Khalidi (see - Criticisms of the "Arab leaders' endorsement of flight" explanation - below)

In the case of the village of [[Ein Karem]], [[William O. Douglas]] was told by the villagers that the cause of their flight was twofold: first, it was caused by fear that came out of the [[Deir Yassin massacre]], and second because "the villagers were told by the Arab leaders to leave. It apparently was a strategy of mass evacuation, whether or not necessary as a military or public safety measure."&lt;ref name = Douglas&gt;''Strange Lands and Friendly People'', William O. Douglas, Harper &amp; Brothers (New York), pp. 265–6.&lt;/ref&gt;

====Statements by Arab leaders and organizations====
[[Khalid al-Azm|Khalid al-`Azm]] who was prime minister of Syria from 17 December 1948 to 30 March 1949, listed in his memoirs a number of reasons for the Arab defeat in an attack on the Arab leaders including his own predecessor [[Jamil Mardam Bey]]:
:Fifth: the Arab governments' invitation to the people of Palestine to flee from it and seek refuge in adjacent Arab countries, after terror had spread among their ranks in the wake of the Deir Yassin event. This mass flight has benefited the Jews and the situation stabilized in their favor without effort.... Since 1948 we have been demanding the return of the refugees to their homeland, while it is we who constrained them to leave it. Between the invitation extended to the refugees and the request to the United Nations to decide upon their return, there elapsed only a few months.&lt;ref&gt;Khaled Al `Azm, Mudhakarat (al-Dar al Muttahida lil-Nashr, Beirut, 1972), Volume I, pp. 386–7.&lt;/ref&gt;

After the war, a few Arab leaders tried to present the Palestinian exodus as a victory by claiming to have planned it. [[Iraqi Prime Minister]] [[Nuri as-Said]] was later quoted as saying: "We will smash the country with our guns and obliterate every place the Jews shelter in. The Arabs should conduct their wives and children to safe areas until the fighting has died down."&lt;ref&gt;[[Iraqi Prime Minister]] [[Nuri Said]]. Quoted in [[Myron Kaufman]], ''The Coming Destruction of Israel'', New York: The American Library Inc., 1970, pp. 26–27.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Jamal Husseini]], Palestinian representative to the [[United Nations]], wrote to the Syrian UN representative, at the end of August 1948,

{{cquote|"The withdrawals were carried out pursuant to an order emanating from Amman.  The withdrawal from Nazareth was ordered by Amman;  the withdrawal from Safad was ordered by Amman; the withdrawal orders from Lydda and Rale are well known to you.  During none of these withdrawals did fighting take place.  The regular armies did not enable the inhabitants of the country to defend themselves, but merely facilitated their escape from Palestine.

All the orders emanated from one place...&lt;ref name="Kimche1960"&gt;Kimche, J., &amp; Kimche, D. (1960). ''A clash of destinies: The Arab-Jewish War and the founding of the State of Israel.''

According to Yitschak Ben Gad, [[Mahmoud Abbas]], then member of [[Executive Committee of the Palestine Liberation Organization|PLO Executive Committee]], wrote an article "Madha `Alamna wa-Madha Yajib An Na`mal" [What We Have Learned and What We Should Do] and published it in "Falastineth-Thawra" [Revolutionary Palestine], the official journal of the [[PLO]], Beirut, in March 26, 1976:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"The Arab armies entered Palestine to protect the Palestinians from the Zionist tyranny but, instead, they abandoned them, forced them to emigrate and to leave their homeland, and threw them into prisons similar to the ghettos in which the Jews used to live in Eastern Europe, as if we were condemned to change places with them: they moved out of their ghettos and we occupied similar ones.

===Criticisms of the "Arab leaders' endorsement of flight" explanation===
Numerous recent  historians, particularly since the 1980s, now dismiss the claim as devoid of evidence,&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Matthews (ed.) [https://books.google.com/books?id=-ubfEsbawzoC&amp;pg=PA41 ''The Israel-Palestine Conflict: Parallel Discourses,''] Taylor &amp; Francis 2011 p.41&lt;/ref&gt; Morris, with others of the [[New Historians]] school, concur that Arab instigation was not the major cause of the refugees' flight.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |title=No Peaceful Solution |first=Miron |last=Rapaport |authorlink=Miron Rapaport|publisher=''Haaretz'' Friday Supplement |date=11.08.2005 |url=http://www.editriceilponte.org/_files/HaaretzInterviewEnglish.pdf |format=PDF |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060507081443/http://www.editriceilponte.org/_files/HaaretzInterviewEnglish.pdf |archivedate=2006-05-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; As regards the overall exodus, they state that the major cause of Palestinian flight was instead military actions by the Israeli Defence Force and fear of them. In their view, Arab instigation can only explain a ''small part'' of the exodus and not a ''large part'' of it.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, Benny (1988): ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem, 1947–1949''.

Frequently repeated virtually identical lists of reasons are quoted on the internet in support of the exodus of the Palestinian Arabs in 1948/1949 being due to orders from Arab leaders.&lt;ref name=JVL&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/jsource/History/refugees.html|title=History &amp; Overview of the Palestinian Refugees|website=www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.peaceforourtime.org.uk/page141.html|title=WHY DID THE ARABS LEAVE ISRAEL?|website=www.peaceforourtime.org.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=JKatz&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eretzyisroel.org/~samuel/refugees.html|title=Arab Refugees and the Right of Return|first=Joseph|last=Katz|website=www.eretzyisroel.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://mepeace.org/forum/topics/arabs-urged-to-flee-from-palestine-in-1948|title=Arabs Urged to Flee from Palestine in 1948:|website=mepeace.org}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=FrontPage&gt;{{cite web|url=http://archive.frontpagemag.com/readArticle.aspx?ARTID=8592|title=FrontPage Magazine - The Big Arab Lie|website=archive.frontpagemag.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 1961 Erskine Childers investigated many of these offered references: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Examining every official Israeli statement about the Arab exodus, I was struck by the fact that no primary evidence of evacuation orders was ever produced. The charge, Israel claimed, was "documented"; but where were the documents? ... In Israel in 1958, as a guest of the Foreign Office and therefore doubly hopeful of serious assistance, I asked to be shown the proofs, I was assured they existed, and was promised them. None had been offered when I left, but I was again assured. I asked to have the material sent on to me. I am still waiting."&lt;ref name=Childers1&gt;[http://www.users.cloud9.net/~recross/israel-watch/ErskinChilders.html Erskine Childers: The Other Exodus (1961)] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091015133337/http://www.users.cloud9.net/~recross/israel-watch/ErskinChilders.html |date=2009-10-15 }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

1) Various quotes have been attributed to Monsignor [[George Hakim]], Greek Catholic Bishop of Galilee, such as “The Arabs were urged to flee by their own leaders" and "The refugees were confident their absence would not last long, and that they would return within a week or two”. Childers investigated this claim:&lt;ref name=Childers1 /&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Another stock quotation down the years has been that, supposedly, of the Greek-Catholic Archbishop of Galilee. For example, Israel's [[Abba Eban]] told the U.N. Special Political Committee in 1957 that the Archbishop had "fully confirmed" that the Arabs were urged to flee by their own leaders. I wrote to His Grace, asking for his evidence of such orders. I hold signed letters from him, with permission to publish, in which he has categorically denied ever alleging Arab evacuation orders; he states that no such orders were ever given. He says that his name has been abused for years; and that the Arabs fled through panic and forcible eviction by Jewish troops."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

2) Another common quote: "The Economist, a frequent critic of the Zionists, reported on October 2, 1948: 'Of the 62,000 Arabs who formerly lived in Haifa not more than 5,000 or 6,000 remained. Various factors influenced their decision to seek safety in flight'. There is but little doubt that the most potent of the factors were the announcements made over the air by the Higher Arab Executive, urging the Arabs to quit".&lt;ref name=JKatz /&gt; Childers also examined this evidence: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"I decided to turn up the relevant (October 2) 1948 issue of the 'Economist.' The passage that has literally, gone around the world was certainly there, but I had already noticed one curious word in it. This was a description of the massacre at Deir Yassin as an "incident." No impartial observer of Palestine in 1948 calls what happened at this avowedly nonbelligerent, unarmed Arab village in April, 1948, an "incident" ... "Over 250 old men, women and children were deliberately butchered, stripped and mutilated or thrown into a well, by men of the Zionist Irgun Zvai Leumi. Seen in its place in the full `Economist' article, it was at once clear that Dr. Kohn's quotation was a second-hand account, inserted as that of an eye-witness at Haifa, by the journal's own correspondent who had not been in that city at the time. And in the rest of the same article, written by the Economist correspondent himself, but never quoted by Israel, the second great wave of refugees were described as "all destitute, as the Jewish troops gave them an hour, in which to quit, but simultaneously requisitioned all transport."&lt;ref name=Childers1 /&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

3) Other popular illustrations are examples of Arab leaders' calls for evacuation, such as:&lt;ref name=JVL /&gt;&lt;ref name=FrontPage /&gt; “The wholesale exodus was due partly to the belief of the Arabs, encouraged by the boasting of an unrealistic press and the irresponsible utterances of some of the Arab leaders that it could be only a matter of some weeks before the Jews were defeated by the armies of the Arab states, and the Palestinian Arabs enabled to re-enter and re-take possession of their country. -- [[Edward Atiyah]] (Secretary of the Arab League, London, The Arabs, 1955, p. 183)”. The quote by Atiya's offered in the lists is however incomplete, because it continues:&lt;ref name=Spectator /&gt;
&lt;blockquote&gt;"But it (the wholesale Arab exodus) was also ... largely due to a policy of deliberate terrorism and eviction followed by the Jewish commanders in the areas they occupied, and reaching its peak of brutality in the massacre of Deir Yassin.&lt;br&gt;There were two good reasons why the Jews should follow such a policy. First, the problem of harbouring within the Jewish State a large and disaffected Arab population had always troubled them. They wanted an exclusively Jewish state, and the presence of such a population that could never be assimilated, that would always resent its inferior position under Jewish rule and stretch a hand across so many frontiers to its Arab cousins in the surrounding countries, would not only detract from the Jewishness of Israel, but also constitute a danger to its existence. Secondly, the Israelis wanted to open the doors of Palestine to unrestricted Jewish immigration. Obviously, the fewer Arabs there were in the country the more room there would be for Jewish immigrants. If the Arabs could be driven out of the land in the course of the fighting, the Jews would have their homes, their lands, whole villages and towns, without even having to purchase them.&lt;ref&gt;[[Edward Atiyah]] (1955) The Arabs; the Origins, Present Conditions, and Prospects of the Arab World. p.183. Penguin {{ASIN|B0000CJ6XN}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

4) Perhaps the most frequent claim in the popular list is the exhortation by the Arab leadership by radio urging their followers to flee:&lt;ref name=JVL /&gt;&lt;ref name=JKatz /&gt;&lt;ref name=FrontPage /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cfoic.com/learn-more/articles-of-interest/the-arab-refugees/|title=The Arab Refugees and the Missing Israeli Narrative - Christian Friends of Israeli Communities|website=www.cfoic.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; "On April 3, 1949, the Near East Broadcasting Station (Cyprus) said: “It must not be forgotten that the Arab Higher Committee encouraged the refugees' flight from their homes in Jaffa, Haifa and Jerusalem.” This was also cited by Cooke and Kimche in the "Spectator Correspondence",&lt;ref name= Spectator /&gt; 
for example (Cooke): "In the United States, long before ever going to Israel, I had heard it emphasized over and over - by Israeli diplomats and visiting officials, in public speeches and in interviews — that the flight of Palestine Arabs was caused by (radio) broadcast (Arab leadership) orders. No other form of order was even mentioned.&lt;ref name=Childers1 /&gt; Erkine Childers and Walid Khalidi therefore checked archived transcripts of all Arab radio services monitored by the BBC and CIA in 1948, and discovered, 
&lt;blockquote&gt;[Childers, from his research into the BBC archives of radio traffic monitoring from Cyprus in 1948]: "[T]here was not a single order, or appeal, or suggestion about evacuation from Palestine from any Arab radio station, inside or outside Palestine, in 1948," and that to the contrary (Arab) broadcasts gave flat orders to civilians to stay put.&lt;ref name= Spectator /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Erskine Childers, "The Other Exodus", in Laqueur, p. 183.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
In the same "Spectator Correspondence", Walid Khalidi supported Childers when he wrote:&lt;ref name=Spectator /&gt; 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"[Page 57]"There are, in fact, two monitoring collections for 1948: one compiled by the BBC, the other by the CIA, both from Cyprus. There is considerable overlapping between these collections but in the interests of “checking” and “rejection” they should be studied separately. Both collections give detailed daily coverage of broadcasts from Arab capitals and of such Zionist radios as Haganab Radio (in Hebrew, English, and Arabic); the Free Hebrew Station (Stern) and the Voice of Fighting Zion (Irgun). I was pleased to see that the researchers of Mr. Childers in the British Museum confirm my own findings. I can report now that the complete CIA collection here in Princeton also overwhelming[y confirms and elaborates the results that Mr. Childers and I have arrived at independently of one another. Briefly, these are the following: (1) There are countless broadcasts by Zionist radios which indicate deliberate psychological warfare against the Arabs. (2) There is not one single instance of an Arab evacuation order or a hint of such an order. (3) There is an impressive stream of explicit Arab orders to the Palestinian
Arab civilians to hold their ground and remain in their towns and villages.&lt;/blockquote&gt;

More evidence is presented by [[Walid Khalidi]].&lt;ref&gt;Khalidi, W.(1959): "Why Did The Palestinians Leave?" ''Middle East Forum'', vol. XXXV, no. 7, pp. 21–24.&lt;/ref&gt; In his article the author argues that steps were taken by Arab governments to prevent Palestinians from leaving, ensuring that they remain to fight, including the denial by Lebanon and [[Syria]] of residency permits to Palestinian males of military age on April 30 and May 6 respectively. He also notes that a number of Arab radio broadcasts urged the inhabitants of Palestine to remain and discussed plans for an Arab administration there.&lt;ref&gt;Khalidi, W.(1959): "Why Did The Palestinians Leave?" ''Middle East Forum'', vol. XXXV, no. 7, pp. 22–24. Cited by Glazer (1980), p. 101.&lt;/ref&gt;

His point is taken by Glazer (1980, p.&amp;nbsp;101), who writes that not only did Arab radio stations appeal to the inhabitants not to leave, but also that Zionist radio stations urged the population to flee, by exaggerating the course of battle, and, in some cases, fabricating complete lies.&lt;ref&gt;Childers, E. (1971): "The Wordless Wish: From Citizens to Refugees" in ''The Transformation of Palestine'', ed. Ibrahim Abu-Lughod (Evenston, Northwestern University Press), pp. 186–87. The period under discussion is April to mid-May 1948. Cited by Glazer, S. (1980): "The Palestinian Exodus in 1948". ''[[Journal of Palestine Studies]]'', vol. 9, no. 4. (Summer, 1980), pp. 96–118.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Glazer (1980, p.&amp;nbsp;105), among those who blame Arab news reports for the resulting panic flight are Polk et al.&lt;ref&gt;Polk, W.; Stamler, D. and Asfour, E.(1957): ''Backdrop to Tragedy—The Struggle for Palestine'', Boston: Beacon Hill Press.&lt;/ref&gt; and Gabbay.&lt;ref&gt;Gabbay, Roney (1959): ''A Political Study of the Arab–Jewish Conflict''. Geneva: Librarie E. Doz.&lt;/ref&gt; They maintain that the Arabs overstated the case of Zionist atrocities, made the situation seem worse than it was and thus caused the population to flee. According to Glazer, Gabbay, in particular, has assembled an impressive listing of sources which describe Zionist cruelty and savagery.&lt;ref&gt;Gabbay, p. 90.&lt;/ref&gt; In this sense, Glazer (1980, p.&amp;nbsp;105) cites the work done by Childers who maintains that it was the Zionists who disseminated these stories, at the time when the Arab sources were urging calm. He cites carefully composed "horror recordings" in which a voice calls out in Arabic for the population to escape because "the Jews are using poison gas and atomic weapons".&lt;ref&gt;Childers: ''The Wordless Wish'', p. 188.&lt;/ref&gt; In the opinion of Glazer (1980, p.&amp;nbsp;108) one of the greatest weaknesses of the traditional Zionist argument, which attempts to explain the exodus as a careful, calculated and organized plan by various Arab authorities, is that it cannot account for the totally disorganized way in which the exodus occurred.&lt;ref&gt;The author cites the examples of Syrkin, Marie (1966): "The Arab Refugees: A Zionist View". ''Commentary'', vol. 41, no. 1., p. 24. Schechtman (1952), pp. 6–7 and Kohn, p. 872.&lt;/ref&gt; As regards the evidence provided supporting the idea that Arab leaders incited the flight of Palestinian population, Glazer (1980, p.&amp;nbsp;106) states, "I am inclined to prefer Childers[' research] because the sources he cites would have reached the masses.... Gabbay's evidence, newspapers and UN documents, were designed for outside consumption, by diplomats and politicians abroad and by the educated and influential Arab decision makers. This is not the kind of material which would necessarily have been in the hands of the common Palestinian."

Flapan&lt;ref&gt;Flapan, Simha (1987): "The Palestinian Exodus of 1948". ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', vol. 16, no. 4. (Summer, 1987), pp. 5–6.&lt;/ref&gt; further maintains that to support their claim that Arab leaders had incited the flight, Israeli and Zionist sources were constantly "quoting" statements by the Arab Higher Committee to the effect that "in a very short time the armies of our Arab sister countries will overrun Palestine, attacking from the land, the sea, and the air, and they will settle accounts with the Jews."&lt;ref&gt;Cohen, Aharon (1964): ''Israel and the Arab World''. Hebrew, Tel Aviv, p. 433.&lt;/ref&gt; Though he accepts that some such statements were issued, he believes that they were intended to stop the panic that was causing the masses to abandon their villages and that they were issued as a warning to the increasing number of Arabs who were willing to accept partition as irreversible and cease struggling against it. From his point of view, in practice the AHC statements boomeranged and further increased Arab panic and flight. According to Aharon Cohen, head of Mapam's Arab department, the Arab leadership was very critical of the "fifth columnists and rumormongers" behind the flight. When, after April 1948, the flight acquired massive dimensions, Azzam Pasha, secretary of the Arab League, and King 'Abdailah both issued public calls to the Arabs not to leave their homes. Fawzi al-Qawuqji, commander of the Arab Liberation Army, was given instructions to stop the flight by force and to requisition transport for this purpose.&lt;ref&gt;See Mutzeiri, Haaretz, 10 May 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; Muhammad Adib al-'Umri, deputy director of the Ramallah broadcasting station, appealed to the Arabs to stop the flight from Janin, Tulkarm, and other towns in the Triangle that were bombed by the Israelis.&lt;ref&gt;Menahem Kapeliuk, Dauar, 6 November 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; On 10 May Radio Jerusalem broadcast orders on its Arab program from Arab commanders and the AHC to stop the mass flight from Jerusalem and its vicinity. Flapan considers that Palestinian sources offer further evidence that even earlier, in March and April, the Arab Higher Committee broadcasting from Damascus demanded that the population stay put and announced that Palestinians of military age were to return from the Arab countries. All Arab officials in Palestine were also asked to remain at their posts&lt;ref&gt;Khalidi, "Why Did The Palestinians Leave?"&lt;/ref&gt; The author claims that such pleas had so little impact because they were outweighed by the cumulative effect of Zionist pressure tactics that ranged from economic and psychological warfare to the systematic ousting of the Arab population by the army.

According to [[Simha Flapan|Flapan]]&lt;ref&gt;Flapan, Simha (1987): "The Palestinian Exodus of 1948". ''Journal of Palestine Studies'', vol. 16, no. 4. (Summer, 1987), p. 5.&lt;/ref&gt; the idea that Arab leaders ordered the Arab masses to leave their homes in order to open the way for the invading armies, after which they would return to share in the victory, makes no sense at all. In his opinion, the Arab armies, coming long distances and operating in or from the Arab areas of Palestine, needed the help of the local population for food, fuel, water, transport, manpower, and information. The author cites a report of the [[Jewish Agency]]'s Arab section from 3 January 1948, at the beginning of the flight, which in his view suggests that the Arabs were already concerned with the possibility of flight, "The Arab exodus from Palestine continues, mainly to the countries of the West. Of late, the Arab Higher Executive has succeeded in imposing close scrutiny on those leaving for Arab countries in the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;Political and Diplomatic Document of the Central Zionist Archives (CZA) and Israel State Archives (ISA), December 1947 – May 1948 (Jerusalem, 1979), doc. 239, 402.&lt;/ref&gt; Flapan maintains that prior to the declaration of statehood, the Arab League's political committee, meeting in Sofar, Lebanon, recommended that the Arab states "open the doors to ... women and children and old people if events in Palestine make it necessary,&lt;ref&gt;. See CZA, 52519007, quoted by Yoram Nimrod in ''Al Hamishmar'', 10 April 1985; see also ISA, 179118, 1 March 1948.&lt;/ref&gt; but that the AHC vigorously opposed the departure of Palestinians and even the granting of visas to women and children.&lt;ref&gt;See Khalidi, "Why Did the Palestinians Leave?"&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Christopher Hitchens]] also expressed doubt as to the validity of claims of orders to leave from the Higher Arab Executive.&lt;ref&gt;[[Blaming the Victims#Broadcasts Christopher Hitchens|Blaming the Victims]]: Spurious Scholarship and the Palestinian Question, "Broadcasts" by Christopher Hitchens 1988 ({{ISBN|0-86091-887-4}}).&lt;/ref&gt;

===Relative importance of Arab evacuation orders===
Morris estimates that Arab orders accounts for at most 5% of the total exodus:
&lt;blockquote&gt;Arab officers ordered the complete evacuation of specific villages in certain areas, lest their inhabitants "treacherously" acquiesce in Israeli rule or hamper Arab military deployments.... There can be no exaggerating the importance of these early Arab-initiated evacuations in the demoralization, and eventual exodus, of the remaining rural and urban populations.&lt;ref name=Morris1&gt;[[Benny Morris]], ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited'', MA: Cambridge University Press, 2004, p. 590.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt; Based on his studies of seventy-three Israeli and foreign archives or other sources, Morris made a judgement as to the main causes for the Arab exodus from each of the 392 settlements that were depopulated during the 1948-1950 conflict (pages xiv to xviii). His tabulation lists "Arab orders" as being a significant "exodus factor" in only 6 of these settlements.

Furthermore, in his comprehensive book on the Arab–Israeli conflict, ''Righteous Victims'', Morris wrote:
&lt;blockquote&gt;In some areas Arab commanders ordered the villagers to evacuate to clear the ground for military purposes or to prevent surrender. More than half a dozen villages ... were abandoned during these months as a result of such orders. Elsewhere, in East Jerusalem and in many villages around the country, the [Arab] commanders ordered women, old people, and children to be sent away to be out of harm's way.... [T]he AHC and the Arab League had periodically endorsed such a move when contemplating the future war in Palestine.&lt;ref&gt;[[Benny Morris]], ''Righteous Victims'' (New York: Vintage Books, 2001), 256, quoted in [[Alan Dershowitz]], ''[[The Case for Israel]]'' (Hoboken: John Wiley &amp; Sons, Inc., 2003), 80.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In a 2003 interview with ''[[Haaretz]]'', Morris summed up the conclusions of his revised edition of ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem'': "In the months of April–May 1948, units of the [[Haganah]] were given operational orders that stated explicitly that they were to uproot the villagers, expel them and destroy the villages themselves. At the same time, it turns out that there was a series of orders issued by the [[Arab Higher Committee]] and by the Palestinian intermediate levels to remove children, women and the elderly from the villages."&lt;ref name = Morris&gt;[[Benny Morris]], from [[Haaretz]] interview prior to the publication of Morris' latest findings in ''The Birth of the Palestinian Refugee Problem Revisited'', 2003.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Arab National Committee in Jerusalem, following the 8 March 1948 instructions of the Arab Higher Committee, ordered women, children and the elderly in various parts of Jerusalem to leave their homes and move to areas "far away from the dangers. Any opposition to this order ... is an obstacle to the holy war ... and will hamper the operations of the fighters in these districts."&lt;ref&gt;Benny Morris (1986), The causes and character of the Arab exodus from Palestine: the Israel Defense Forces intelligence branch analysis of June 1948, ''Middle Eastern Studies'', vol 22, 5–19.&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1959 paper, [[Walid Khalidi]] attributed the "Arab evacuation story" to [[Joseph Schechtman]], who wrote two 1949 pamphlets in which "the evacuation order first makes an elaborate appearance."&lt;ref&gt;[http://caliber.ucpress.net/doi/abs/10.1525/jps.2005.34.2.042 Why Did the Palestinians Leave, Revisited] Walid Khalidi, ''Journal of Palestine Studies'' Winter 2005, vol. 34, no. 2, pp. 42–54.&lt;/ref&gt; Morris, too, did not find any blanket orders of evacuation.&lt;ref&gt;Morris, 2003, pp. 269–270.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Cavalcade south frieze Parthenon BM.jpg|right|thumb|Cavalcade. Block VII from the south frieze of the Parthenon, ca. 447–433 BC. (British Museum)]]
A '''cavalcade''' is a [[procession]] or [[parade]] on [[Equestrianism|horseback]], or a mass [[Trail riding|trail ride]] by a company of riders.  The focus of a cavalcade is participation rather than display. Often, the participants do not wear costumes or ride in formation. Often, a cavalcade [[Historical reenactment|re-enacts an important historical event]] and follows a [[Long-distance trail|long distance trail]].  A cavalcade may also be a [[pilgrimage]].

[[Image:Procesion.jpg|right|thumb|Ceremonial entry into or departure from a town]]
Many cavalcades involve ceremonial entries into and departures from towns and villages along the way.  A small version of such a ceremonial entry is the "grand entry" that is traditional in many [[rodeo]]s.{{dubious|date=July 2013}}  Long-distance cavalcades may acquire more riders who join from populated places along its route.

The term cavalcade comes from the classical Latin word ''caballus'', used to describe a strong work horse.  This developed into the word ''caballicare,'' "to ride horseback," which in Italian became ''cavalcare.'' In Spanish the term for cavalcade is ''cabalgata.''

[[Image:Chimayo rides1.jpg|thumb|right|Automobile cavalcade to El Santuario de Chimayó]]
In [[New Mexico]], [[Philmont Scout Ranch]] includes a week-long cavalcade among its programs. The annual [[pilgrimage]] to [[El Santuario de Chimayo|El Santuario de Chimayó]] includes a cavalcade of [[classic car]]s on [[Good Friday]]. Traditionally, the pilgrimage had been made on foot. Today, in addition to traveling by car and foot, a few pilgrims ride horses.&lt;ref&gt;[https://flickr.com/photos/santafesweets/2352985951/ Flickr.com:  Chimayo pilgrims on horseback, 2008]&lt;/ref&gt;  [[Columbus, New Mexico]] is the end point of the annual Cabalgata Binacional Villista (see [[#Chihuahua]]).{{dubious|date=July 2013}}{{unreliable source?|date=July 2013}}

In [[Texas]], numerous long-distance cavalcades occur annually in conjunction with the [[Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo#Trail Rides|Houston Livestock Show and Rodeo]]; the oldest of these was established in 1952, creating a new tradition based on historic activities.  A 110-mile cavalcade is held annually on the [[Chisholm Trail]] (paved roads) from [[Cuero, Texas|Cuero]] to [[San Antonio, Texas|San Antonio]] in conjunction with the San Antonio Livestock Show and Rodeo.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lazyfranch.com/chisholm.html Lazy F Guest Ranch]&lt;/ref&gt;{{dubious|date=July 2013}}&lt;!--issue is if a rodeo parade or a cattle drive is a "cavalcade"--&gt;

==Mexico==

===Sonora===
In [[Sonora]], cavalcades are regular annual events in March and October.

On 26 through 28 October 2007 the [[Governor of Sonora]], [[Eduardo Bours]], and the regional Cattlemen's Association led a cavalcade of approximately 7,000 cowboys who were primarily from the local area, the state of Sonora, some other Mexican states and several western U.S. states.  The cavalcade was called ''Remontando El Río Sahuaripa 2007,'' and the route covered 61 kilometers. Beginning in [[Sahuaripa]], the group traveled south following the river upstream, through the municipality of [[Arivechi]], passing the banks of the Cajon de Onapa Reservoir Lake, and ending in the village of Guisamopa. The cowboys and horses were fed and supplied by an elaborate "Chuck Wagon" system.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.google.com/search?gbv=2&amp;hl=en&amp;client=firefox-a&amp;channel=s&amp;rls=org.mozilla%3Aen-US%3Aofficial&amp;q=cabalgata+sahuaripa+2007&amp;btnG=Search Google search]&lt;/ref&gt;  That cavalcade is the focal end stage of the {{convert|500|km|mi|abbr=on}} ''Cabalgando por Sonora'' from the Río Sonora to the Sierra Alta.

===Chihuahua===
In [[Chihuahua (state)|Chihuahua]], two separate cavalcades commemorate the history of the [[Mexican Revolution]] and [[Pancho Villa|Francisco (Pancho) Villa]].{{citation needed|date=July 2013}}

====Cabalgata Binacional Villista====
Each year in February and March, the ''Cabalgata Binacional Villista'' commemorates the 9 March 1916 invasion of the United States by [[Pancho Villa]]'s men.  The first cavalcade took place in 1999 and followed the same route that Pancho Villa used, coming from the Hacienda de San Jeronimo, [[Bachíniva]].  A handful of riders were expected but more than 125 showed up.  The Cabalgata passed [[Namiquipa]] and Cruces, as during the original 1916 event. In 2008 the 9th cavalcade began on 27 February in [[Ciudad Madera, Chihuahua|Ciudad Madera]] with more than 200 riders.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.devenir.com.mx/portada/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=892&amp;Itemid=1 Ciudad Madera dará la bienvenida a la Novena Cabalgata Binacional Villista]{{dead link|date=August 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }} on devenir.com.mx, 25 February 2008, accessed 15 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt; During the next 10 days, they traversed {{convert|397|km|mi|abbr=on}} north through towns and villages in northern Mexico (Ignacio Zaragoza, [[Buenaventura, Chihuahua|Buenaventura]], [[Galeana, Chihuahua|Galeana]], [[Nuevo Casas Grandes]], [[Casas Grandes]], Colonia Graciano Sánchez, [[Janos, Chihuahua|Janos]], [[Ascensión, Chihuahua|Ascensión]], [[Seis de Enero, Chihuahua|Seis de Enero]]) to [[Puerto Palomas, Chihuahua|Puerto Palomas de Villa]], arriving on 7 March with a complement of 400 riders and twice as many crew.

On 8 March 100 riders continued across the [[United States–Mexico border]] 3 miles to the Pancho Villa State Park and Museum in the village of [[Columbus, New Mexico]]. From the border the Villistas were accompanied by 200 American riders.  The 8th cavalcade in 2007 was larger, with 500 riders arriving in Puerto Palomas de Villa.  The 7th cavalcade in 2006 was smaller but the arrival of the 100 Villistas at [[Pancho Villa State Park]] coincided with ceremonies attended by New Mexico Governor [[Bill Richardson]], Chihuahua Governor [[José Reyes Baeza Terrazas]], and many other dignitaries.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.emnrd.state.nm.us/prd/Media%20Releases/panchovillamuseum.htm Governor Richardson, Governor Baeza Meet for Grand Opening of New Pancho Villa State Park Visitor Center], Press Release, New Mexico State Parks Division, 11 March 2006.&lt;/ref&gt; The cavalcade in 2010 was the opening event of the centennial celebrations ''Tres Siglos, Tres Fiestas'' (Three Centuries, Three Fiestas).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The riders are received each night with a dinner, rodeo, music and dancing, and their horses are fed and watered. The growing popularity of the cavalcade presented increasing financial challenges for the communities along the route. In 2008, the community presidents formed an association, Presidentes Municipales de la Región Noroeste, to coordinate and manage the event.

Horses traveling from Mexico to the United States normally are subject to [[quarantine]] of at least 3 days,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aphis.usda.gov/NCIE/3day_equine.html Importing a horse into the United States] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080418050951/http://www.aphis.usda.gov/NCIE/3day_equine.html |date=2008-04-18 }} USDA guide sheet for horses that require a 3-day quarantine, accessed 13 March 2008&lt;/ref&gt; but starting in 2006, a special 12-hour waiver was obtained for up to 100 horses (hence the limit of 100 Villistas).  Before 2006, the Mexican horses were left behind in Mexico, and the Villistas rode American horses from the border to the park.&lt;ref&gt;"Camp Furlong Day: Two countries remember," ''Las Cruces Sun-News,'' S. Derrickson Moore, 2 March 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;

The 11th cavalcade in 2010 began on February 23 in Hacienda San Jeronimo, Bachíniva, repeating the historical original route, passing through Namiquipa, Cruces to Buenaventura. There the cavalcade joined the group coming from Madera, continuing together up to Columbus, New Mexico.

====Cabalgata Villista====
Each year in July the ''Cabalgata Villista'' (also known as ''La Gran Cabalgata Villista'') commemorates the [[assassination]] of Francisco (Pancho) Villa on 20 July 1923 in [[Parral, Chihuahua|Parral]].  The cavalcade was initiated by José Socorro Salcido Gómez in 1996.  It travels to Parral from [[Chihuahua, Chihuahua|Chihuahua City]], a distance of {{convert|220|km|mi|abbr=on}}, led by municipal, state, and federal dignitaries. In general, its route passes through [[Satevó]] and
[[Valle de Zaragoza]], with riders (''[[jinetes]]'') joining the cavalcade along the way.  Since 1996 the cavalcade has grown progressively larger; in 2007 3,000 riders participated.  The 2008 cavalcade was still larger.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

'''Charles Frederick Rogers''' (December 30, 1921&lt;ref name=mbenson&gt;{{cite book|last=Benson|first=Michael|title=Who's Who in the JFK Assassination: An A to Z Encyclopedia|publisher=Citadel Press|isbn=0-806-51444-2|pages=385–386}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{spaced ndash}} disappeared June 23, 1965) was an American [[seismologist]], [[Aviator|pilot]], and suspected [[murderer]]. Rogers disappeared in June 1965 after police discovered the dismembered bodies of his elderly parents in the refrigerator of the [[Houston]] home all three shared. The media later dubbed the crime "The Icebox Murders".&lt;ref name="Lomax"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://blogs.houstonpress.com/hairballs/2009/08/houston_101_a_notorious_montro.php |title=Houston 101: A Notorious Montrose Murder's (Alleged) Connection To The Deaths of JFK and MLK |last1=Lomax |first1=John Nova |date=August 6, 2009 |website=blogs.houstonpress.com |publisher=Houston Press |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Rogers has never been found and was [[Declared death in absentia|declared dead ''in absentia'']] in July 1975. He remains the only suspect in the murders, which are still considered unsolved.

==Background and education==
In 1942, Rogers enrolled at [[Texas A&amp;M University]] but later dropped out.&lt;ref name="victoria"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19650625&amp;id=lntaAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5841,3030093|title=Houston Recluse Sought In Butchering Of Parents|date=June 25, 1965|work=The Victoria Advocate|pages=1, 9|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; He then enrolled at the [[University of Houston]] where he earned a Bachelor of Science degree in [[nuclear physics]]. During [[World War II]], he was a pilot in the [[United States Navy]] and also served in the Office of Naval Intelligence.&lt;ref name="Rufcah"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://houston.culturemap.com/news/city-life/01-08-12-14-59-a-dark-history-houstons-5-most-notorious-murders/ |title=Houston's crime rate is at a low, but its history is dark: The city's five most notorious murders |last1=Rufcah |first1=Sarah |date=January 8, 2012 |website=houston.culturemap.com |publisher=CultureMapHouston |accessdate=June 12, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; After the war, he worked as a [[seismologist]] for [[Shell Oil]] for nine years.&lt;ref name=mbenson/&gt; He abruptly quit his job in 1957 without giving an explanation.&lt;ref name="victoria"/&gt;

Friends and associates of Rogers later said that he was highly intelligent and had a talent for finding gas, oil and gold for companies that he worked for. He also spoke seven languages and had an interest in [[ham radio]]s.&lt;ref name="foxdfw"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.myfoxdfw.com/story/17513808/the-tex-files-icebox-murders|title=The Tex Files: Icebox Murders|date=February 17, 2011|publisher=myfoxdfw.com|accessdate=September 29, 2014|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141013173159/http://www.myfoxdfw.com/story/17513808/the-tex-files-icebox-murders#|archive-date=October 13, 2014|dead-url=yes|df=mdy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the mid-1950s, Rogers joined the [[Civil Air Patrol]] where he reportedly met [[David Ferrie]] who was later named as a conspirator in the [[assassination of President John F. Kennedy]] by New Orleans District Attorney [[Jim Garrison]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Vance|first1=Mike|last2=Lomax|first2=John Nova|title=Murder and Mayhem in Houston: Historic Bayou City Crime|year=2014|publisher=The History Press|isbn=1-626-19521-8|page=108}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Murders and disappearance==
By 1965, Rogers was unemployed and living with his elderly parents, Fred Christopher (born January 19, 1884) and Edwina Ivor Rogers (née Harman; born October 8, 1892), in the [[Montrose, Houston|Montrose]] neighborhood of [[Houston]].&lt;ref name="victoria"/&gt; Described as "reclusive",&lt;ref name="Rufcah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Publishers Weekly1"/&gt; Rogers was reported to have communicated with his parents by way of notes slipped under the door. Neighbors were unaware that Rogers lived with his parents as he generally left the home before dawn and did not return until after dark.&lt;ref name="victoria"/&gt;

On June 23, 1965, two Houston police officers forced their way into the Rogers' home after Edwina's nephew Marvin became concerned about the couple when his phone calls to his aunt went unanswered for days. Upon entering the home, police found nothing unusual but noticed food sitting on the dining room table.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.texasarchive.org/library/index.php?title=2016_04159|title=The KHOU-TV Collection - News Clips, May and June 1965|last=KHOU-TV|first=|date=|website=Texas Archive of the Moving Image|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=2018-10-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; One officer opened the refrigerator and found what appeared to be numerous cuts of washed, unwrapped meat neatly stacked on the shelves.&lt;ref name="victoria"/&gt; The officer later recalled that he thought the meat was that of a butchered hog.&lt;ref name=benson&gt;Benson p.386&lt;/ref&gt; As the officer was closing the door, he noticed two human heads visible through the clear glass of the vegetable bin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=1346&amp;dat=19840626&amp;id=p-8vAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6623,3979856|title=Police still want son of couple killed in 1965|date=June 26, 1984|work=Lakeland Ledger|page=4C|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; The heads were those of Fred and Edwina Rogers. What the officer initially thought was unwrapped cuts of hog meat were the couple's dismembered limbs and torsos.&lt;ref name="victoria"/&gt; Police later discovered the couple's organs in a nearby sewer (the organs had been removed, cut up and flushed down the toilet) while other remains were never found.&lt;ref name="Rufcah"/&gt; Police determined that Fred and Edwina Rogers had been killed on June 20, [[Father's Day]].&lt;ref name="foxdfw"/&gt; An autopsy showed that Fred Rogers was killed by blows to the head with a [[claw hammer]].&lt;ref name="victoria"/&gt; His eyes had been gouged out and his genitalia were removed. Edwina Rogers had been beaten and shot, execution style, in the head.&lt;ref name="foxdfw"/&gt;

Police said that the bodies of Fred and Edwina Rogers were dismembered in the upstairs bathroom by a person "with some knowledge of anatomy". There was little blood in the house and it appeared it had been thoroughly cleaned after the murders.&lt;ref name="victoria"/&gt; What little blood was found led to Charles Rogers' bedroom. There, police found a blood stained [[keyhole saw]] but no trace of Rogers.&lt;ref name="Lomax"/&gt; A search for Rogers was launched and a warrant was issued for him as a [[material witness]] to the crime but Rogers was never found.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?nid=861&amp;dat=19910929&amp;id=NG5IAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=4018,5987367|title=Houston murder suspect linked to JFK plot, CIA|date=September 29, 1991|work=The Victoria Advocate|page=12A|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Allegations of involvement in the assassination of JFK==
Rogers' life was documented in the 1992 book ''The Man on the Grassy Knoll'' by John R. Craig and Philip A. Rogers.&lt;ref name="Rufcah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Publishers Weekly1"&gt;{{cite web|title=The Man on the Grassy Knoll |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/978-0-380-77127-1|work=publishersweekly.com|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=June 12, 2014|author=Publishers Weekly|authorlink=Publishers Weekly|date=November 2, 1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to this work, Rogers was a CIA agent who likely impersonated [[Lee Harvey Oswald]] in Mexico City and, along with [[Charles Harrelson]], was one of two shooters involved in the [[assassination of President John F. Kennedy]].&lt;ref name="Rufcah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Lomax"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Publishers Weekly1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kroth"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kroth |first=Jerome A. |title=Conspiracy in Camelot: The Complete History of the Assassination of John Fitzgerald Kennedy |year=2003 |publisher=Algora Publishing |location= |isbn=0-87586-247-0 |page=197 |ref=harv}}&lt;/ref&gt; The authors allege that Rogers, Harrelson, and [[Chauncey Holt]] were the "[[three tramps]]" arrested in [[Dealey Plaza]] after the assassination and that Rogers murdered his parents because his mother was tracking his many telephone calls.&lt;ref name="Rufcah"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Publishers Weekly1"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Kroth"/&gt; In this account, Rogers fled to Guatemala.&lt;ref name=gustin1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2002-12-19/news/murder-they-wrote/|title=Murder, They Wrote|last=Gustin|first=Marene|date=December 19, 2002|publisher=houstonpress.com|page=1|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Publishers Weekly]]'' reviewed the book stating: "The authors do a workmanlike job with their thesis, but the degree of poetic license, in terms of reconstructed dialogue and attributed thought, seems excessive here, and sourcing is virtually nonexistent. Assassination buffs, however, will welcome the book for its novelty value and its easy readability."&lt;ref name="Publishers Weekly1"/&gt;

==Aftermath==
In 1975, a Houston judge declared Charles Rogers [[declared death in absentia|legally dead]] so his estate could be [[probate]]d.&lt;ref name=benson/&gt; The case still remains officially unsolved and Charles Rogers remains the only suspect.&lt;ref name="foxdfw"/&gt;

Houston [[forensic accountant]] Hugh Gardenier and his wife Martha have continued to investigate the case and concluded that Charles Rogers did kill his parents and was later killed in [[Honduras]].&lt;ref name=gustin1/&gt; While they have dismissed John R. Craig and Philip A. Rogers' claim that Charles Rogers was a CIA operative due to a lack of evidence, they admit that Rogers did have dealings with contract workers for the CIA when he worked as a seismologist. The Gardeniers believe that Rogers planned the murder of his parents for years because his father was abusive and both parents were "devious con artists". According to the Gardeniers, Fred Rogers worked as a bookie who regularly engaged in illegal activities such as gambling and fraud. They believe he continued abusing Charles into adulthood and began stealing large sums of money from him.&lt;ref name="foxdfw"/&gt; After killing and dismembering his parents, the Gardeniers say that Rogers fled the United States for Mexico and was never found because he was aided by "powerful friends" he met through his ham radio hobby and while working for various oil and mining companies.&lt;ref name="foxdfw"/&gt; They have theorized that Rogers eventually made his way to Honduras where he was killed over a wage dispute with miners.&lt;ref name=gustin2&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.houstonpress.com/2002-12-19/news/murder-they-wrote/2/|title=Murder, They Wrote|last=Gustin|first=Marene|date=December 19, 2002|publisher=houstonpress.com|page=2|accessdate=September 29, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; In October 2003, Redbud Publishing released ''The Ice Box Murders'', a novel written by Hugh and Martha Gardenier.&lt;ref name="Publishers Weekly2"&gt;{{cite web|title= First Fiction at the Regionals; Several debut novels have diverse connections to the trade-show regions |url=http://www.publishersweekly.com/pw/print/20030818/40453-first-fiction-at-the-regionals.html|work=publishersweekly.com|publisher=Publishers Weekly|accessdate=June 12, 2014|author=Publishers Weekly|authorlink=Publishers Weekly|date=August 18, 2003}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to a review in the ''[[Houston Press]]'': "The Ice Box Murders is written as fact-based fiction and supposition. There are many unnamed characters in the book: various politicians and attorneys as well as the eyewitness who said he saw Rogers in Honduras after 1965."&lt;ref name=gustin2/&gt; ''Publishers Weekly'' also referred to the novel as "fact-based fiction".&lt;ref name="Publishers Weekly2"/&gt;

The house in which the murders took place was located at 1815 Driscoll Street. After the murders, the house remained empty and unsold. It was torn down in 1972. The lot remained empty until 2000 when [[condominium]]s were built on the lot.&lt;ref name="foxdfw"/&gt;

==In popular culture==
Rogers is featured in two novels by [[James Ellroy]]: ''[[American Tabloid]]'' and ''[[The Cold Six Thousand]]''.&lt;ref name="Lomax"/&gt;

The murder case involving Rogers, as well as Hugh and Martha Gardenier looking into the case, is the subject of Episode 41 of the ''Criminal'' podcast, titled "Open Case".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last1=Hlavaty|first1=Craig|title=Houston couple who solved grisly 'Ice Box Murders' profiled by true crime podcasters|url=https://www.chron.com/news/houston-texas/houston/amp/Grisly-Ice-Box-Murders-7251178.php|website=Houston Chronicle|publisher=chron.com|accessdate=July 16, 2017|date=April 15, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="3049">'''Christian Rath''' (October 22, 1831-February 14, 1920) was a German-American soldier and businessman. Among his duties as an officer in the U.S. Army was to act as the executioner for several of the conspirators in the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]].&lt;ref name="BoothieBarn"&gt;{{cite web |last1=Ramirez Taylor |first1=Kate |title=Grave Thursday: Captain Christian Rath |url=https://boothiebarn.com/2017/01/05/grave-thursday-captain-christian-rath/ |website=BoothieBarn |accessdate=10 June 2018 |date=5 January 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Early life==
Rath was born to Johann Adam and Anna Marie (Schlee) Rath in [[Pfalzgrafenweiler]], [[Landkreis Freudenstadt]], [[Baden-Württemberg]], in modern [[Germany]]. At the age of 18, he left home to participate in the [[German revolutions of 1848–49|revolutionary movement]] sweeping the region at that time.&lt;ref name="Find A Grave"&gt;{{cite web |title=Capt Christian Rath |url=https://www.findagrave.com/memorial/21138367/christian-rath |website=Find A Grave |accessdate=10 June 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

At the age of 19, he emigrated to the United States. He served in the [[United States Navy]] for a brief time, and then settled in [[Jackson, Michigan]].

==U.S. Army service==
After the outbreak of the [[American Civil War]], Rath enlisted in the [[17th Michigan Volunteer Infantry Regiment]].&lt;ref name="MLive"&gt;{{cite news |last1=Smith |first1=Leanne |title=Jackson resident played key role in execution of people convicted in plot to assassinate Abraham Lincoln; his role was excluded from "The Conspirator" |url=http://www.mlive.com/news/jackson/index.ssf/2011/04/jackson_resident_played_key_ro.html |accessdate=10 June 2018 |work=MLive |date=15 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Execution of Lincoln conspirators===
[[File:Execution Lincoln assassins.jpg|thumb|right|200px|Execution of (''left to right'') Surratt, Powell, Herold, and Atzerodt on July 7, 1865, at the Washington Arsenal in Washington, D.C.]]
While detailed to the staff of Major General [[John F. Hartranft]], Rath was assigned various duties related to the executions by [[hanging]] of [[Mary Surratt]], [[Lewis Paine]], [[David Herold]], and [[George Atzerodt]] on July 7, 1865, due their guilty verdicts stemming from the [[assassination of Abraham Lincoln]]. These duties included making and hanging the nooses, giving the command for the prisoners to be hung, and arranging for their bodies to be put into coffins and buried.

==Later life==
Rath was discharged from the Union Army on July 19, 1865, twelve days after his participation in the execution, and returned to his home in Jackson, Michigan.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="14789">The [[Government of Canada|Canadian government's]] first attempt to restrict immigration was to pass an [[order-in-council]] on January 8, 1908, that prohibited immigration of persons who "in the opinion of the Minister of the Interior" did not "come from the country of their birth or citizenship by a '''continuous journey''' and or through tickets purchased before leaving their country of their birth or nationality." In practice this applied only to ships that began their voyage in India, as the great distance usually necessitated a stopover in [[Japan]] or [[Hawaii]]. These regulations came at a time when Canada was accepting massive numbers of [[Immigration to Canada|immigrants]] (over 400,000 in 1913 alone &amp;ndash; a figure that remains unsurpassed to this day), almost all of whom came from [[Europe]].

==History==
===Background===
During the first two decades of the 20th century, some provinces in Canada enacted laws limiting the [[civil rights]] of Indians, including the right to vote, hold public office, serve on juries, or practice as pharmacists, lawyers, and accountants.
However, because India, like Canada, was part of the [[British Empire]], Canadian authorities did not pass exclusion laws explicitly targeting those of Indian origin. The Imperial authorities in [[London]] had noted Indian resentment when Australia enacted [[White Australia policy|immigration restrictions]] implicitly designed to restrict non-European immigration in 1901, based on similar legislation in [[South Africa]].  [[New Zealand]] had passed similar restrictive legislation in 1899.

When Canada started making provisions to block immigration from India, London warned it to be cautious in its approach and to be aware that its actions might inflame nationalist fervour in India. With this in mind, Canadian immigration authorities decided to '''indirectly''' halt Indian immigration to the country.

===Continuous Journey Regulation===
The government's first attempt to restrict immigration from India was to pass an order-in-council on January 8, 1908, that prohibited immigration of persons who "in the opinion of the Minister of the Interior" did not "come from the country of their birth or citizenship by a '''continuous journey''' and or through tickets purchased before leaving their country of their birth or nationality." In practice this applied only to ships that began their voyage in India, as the great distance usually necessitated a stopover in Japan or Hawaii. This was discriminatory to Indians who could not travel directly to Canada.

The new regulation was soon challenged with the arrival of the S.S. ''Monteagle'' in British Columbia in late February 1908.  The ship carried more than 200 passengers, 105 of whom had boarded in Calcutta.  A number of the passengers were ordered deported as they did not comply with the new regulation.  The orders were challenged in court.  Justice Clement of the Supreme Court of B.C. quashed the deportation orders on March 24, 1908, after he found the regulation to be invalid, as the Immigration Act did not authorize the delegation of decision making to the Minister of the Interior, as stated in the regulation.&lt;ref&gt;Re Behari et al. (1908), 13 B.C.R. 415 (B.C.S.C.); Johnston, H., Voyage of the Komagata Maru, p. 5, footnote 9.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Impact of the Continuous Journey Regulation===
The government responded by introducing an amendment to the Immigration Act, which expressly authorized a regulation "to prohibit landing of any specified class of immigrants or any immigrants who have come to Canada otherwise than by continuous journey from the country of which they are natives or citizens and upon through tickets purchased in that country."

The amendment was enacted on April 10, 1908.&lt;ref&gt;S.C. 1908, c. 33&lt;/ref&gt; The government passed an order-in-council under the amended Act on May 27, 1908.  A further regulation was passed by an order-in-council on June 3, 1908, which stated that "No immigrant of Asiatic origin shall be permitted to enter Canada unless in actual and personal possession in his or her own right of two hundred dollars, unless such person is a native or subject of an Asiatic country in regard to which special statutory regulations are in force or with which the Government of Canada has made a special treaty, agreement or convention."

While neither regulation expressly referred to India, they effectively stopped immigration from India as the $200 cash requirement limit was a significant hurdle for most potential immigrants from India, and the continuous journey regulation was made effective by pressuring steamship companies not to provide direct service between Canada and India or to sell through tickets from Indian ports.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, H., op.cit., pages 4 and 5.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Canadian Pacific]] did run a very lucrative shipping line between Vancouver and Calcutta. However, the Canadian government forced the company to stop this service. It was now impossible to come via continuous journey to Canada.{{Citation needed|date=September 2015}}

A new, revised Immigration Act was enacted on May 4, 1910.&lt;ref&gt;S.C. 1910, c. 27&lt;/ref&gt; It included provisions similar, though not the same as provisions in the 1906 Act, which authorized the continuous journey and $200 cash requirement regulations.  The two 1908 regulations were reenacted on May 9, 1910, by orders-in-council P.C. 920 and P.C. 926.

===Court ruling Continuous Journey Regulation as invalid===
The continuous journey regulation came under judicial review in 1911, in a case before the Supreme Court of B.C. involving Hussain Rahim, a known revolutionary from Bengal, India.  On November 9, 1911, Mr. Justice Morrison issued a writ of habeas corpus to quash a deportation order made against Mr. Rahim.  In granting the order, the judge commented that the 1910 continuous journey regulation was invalid, as its wording (copied from the 1908 regulation) did not conform with the enacting provision of Paragraph 38(a) of the 1910 Immigration Act.&lt;ref&gt;Re Rahim (1911), 16 B.C.R. 369 (B.C.S.C.); Re Rahim (1911), 16 B.C.R. 471 (B.C.S.C.).&lt;/ref&gt;

The judgement did not result in any significant increase in attempts at immigration from India.  Both regulations underwent judicial scrutiny again in November 1913, in the course of two cases before the Supreme Court of B.C.  The first involved Bhagwan Singh Jakh, a known revolutionary from Punjab, India, who had entered Canada by falsely representing that he was a returning resident of Canada.  The second case involved 39 passengers from India who arrived in Victoria, B.C., on October 17, 1913, on the ship ''Panama Maru'', and who were detained and ordered deported under the Immigration Act.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, H., op. cit., pp. 17-19.&lt;/ref&gt;

While court proceedings were still pending, Jakh was forcefully deported on November 19, 1913, in the face of a writ of habeas corpus issued by the Supreme Court of B.C.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, H., op.cit., pp. 19 and 20; Singh, K., Canadian Sikhs (Part One) and Komagata Maru Massacre, pp. 112 and 113.&lt;/ref&gt;  On November 28, 1913, Mr. Justice Hunter quashed the deportation orders made against 35 of the 39 passengers (applications concerning four passengers were withdrawn when the case was heard), by finding that: (a) the $200 cash requirement regulation was invalid as its reference to "Asiatic origin" did not conform with Section 37 of the 1910 Act, which authorized regulations in respect of persons of the "Asiatic race"; and (b) the continuous journey regulation was invalid for the reasons given by Justice Morrison in the Rahim case.&lt;ref&gt;Re Narain Singh et al. (1913), 18 B.C.R. 506 (B.C.S.C.)&lt;/ref&gt;

Word of Justice Hunter's decision spread abroad, with Indians resident in Canada urging others to come to Canada before the rules were changed again.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, H., op. cit., pp. 22 and 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

"The federal government's continuous-journey provision remained law until 1947, as did most BC anti-South Asian legislation. Because of community pressure and representations by the government of India, Canada allowed the wives and dependent children of South Asian Canadian residents to immigrate in 1919, and by the mid-1920s a small flow of wives and children had been established. This did not counter the effect of migration by South Asian Canadians to India and the US, which by the mid-1920s had reduced the South Asian population in Canada to about 1300."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Norman Buchignani |url=http://www.thecanadianencyclopedia.com/index.cfm?PgNm=TCE&amp;Params=A1ARTA0007574 |title=South Asians |publisher=[[The Canadian Encyclopedia]] |date= |accessdate=2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Legislative countermeasures===
As an appeal from Justice Hunter's decision was limited by law, the government responded quickly, by enacting new continuous journey and $200 cash requirement regulations on January 7, 1914, by orders-in-council P.C. 23 and P.C. 24.  The new regulations conformed with the enacting provisions in the 1910 Act, in accordance with Justice Hunter's decision.&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, H., op. cit., pp. 25 and 26.&lt;/ref&gt; The new regulations appeared to be immune from any further legal challenge.

==''Komagata Maru'' Incident==
[[Baba Gurdit Singh|Gurdit Singh Sandhu]], from [[Amritsar]], was a well-to-do government contractor in [[Singapore]] who was aware of the problems that Indians were facing in getting to Canada due to exclusion laws. Though Gurdit Singh was apparently aware of the January 1914 regulations when he chartered the ''Komagata Maru'',&lt;ref&gt;Johnston, H., op. cit., p. 26.&lt;/ref&gt; he continued with his purported goal of challenging the continuous journey regulation and opening the door for immigration from India to Canada. The passengers consisted of 340 [[Sikhs]], 24 [[Muslims]], and 12 [[Hindus]], all [[British subject]]s.

When the ''Komagata Maru'' arrived in Canadian waters, it was not allowed to dock. The government mobilised {{HMCS|Rainbow|1891|6}}, a former [[Royal Navy]] ship &lt;!--standing idle in [[Esquimalt]].!--&gt; under the command of Commander Hose, with troops from the [[11th Regiment Irish Fusiliers of Canada]], [[72nd Regiment "Seaforth Highlanders of Canada"]], and the [[6th Regiment "The Duke of Connaught's Own Rifles"]]. In the end, only 24 passengers were admitted to Canada, since the ship had violated the exclusion laws, the passengers did not have the required funds, and they had not sailed directly from India. The ship was turned around and forced to depart on July 23 for Asia.

The ''Komagata Maru'' incident was widely cited at the time by Indian groups to highlight discrepancies in Canadian immigration laws. Further, the inflamed passions in the wake of the incident were widely cultivated by the Indian revolutionary organisation, the [[Ghadar Party]], to rally support for its aims.

=== Governmental apologies ===
In response to calls for the government of Canada to address historic wrongs involving immigration and wartime measures, the Conservative government in 2006 created the community historical recognition program to provide grant and contribution funding for community projects linked to wartime measures and immigration restrictions and a national historical recognition program to fund federal initiatives, developed in partnership with various groups. The announcement was made on June 23, 2006, at the time Prime Minister Harper apologized in the House of Commons for the head tax against Chinese immigrants.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://pch.gc.ca/newsroom/index_e.cfm?fuseaction=displayDocument&amp;DocIDCd=CS060471 |title=Newsroom - The Department |publisher=Pch.gc.ca |date=2009-10-02 |accessdate=2011-06-05 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080502054401/http://pch.gc.ca/newsroom/index_e.cfm?fuseaction=displayDocument&amp;DocIDCd=CS060471 |archivedate=2008-05-02 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

On May 23, 2008, the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia unanimously passed a resolution "that this Legislature apologizes for the events of May 23, 1914, when 376 passengers of the ''Komagata Maru'', stationed off Vancouver harbour, were denied entry by Canada. The House deeply regrets that the passengers, who sought refuge in our country and our province, were turned away without benefit of the fair and impartial treatment befitting a society where people of all cultures are welcomed and accepted."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.leg.bc.ca/38th4th/votes/v080523.htm |title=Votes and Proceedings of the Legislative Assembly of British Columbia |publisher=Leg.bc.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On August 3, 2008, Prime Minister [[Stephen Harper]] appeared at the 13th annual Ghadri Babiyan Da Mela (festival) in Surrey, B.C. to issue an apology for the ''Komagata Maru'' incident. He said, in response to the House of Commons motion calling for an apology by the government, "On behalf of the government of Canada, I am officially conveying as prime minister that apology."&lt;ref&gt;Prime Minister of Canada, Public events for August 3, 2008: http://pm.gc.ca/eng/media.asp?category=4&amp;id=2205; PM apologizes for 1914 Komagata Maru incident, CP, Aug. 4, 2008: {{cite web|url=http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Politics/2008/08/03/6345366-cp.html |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2009-11-28 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20080806093424/http://cnews.canoe.ca/CNEWS/Politics/2008/08/03/6345366-cp.html |archivedate=2008-08-06 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Some members of the Sikh community were unsatisfied with the apology as they expected it to be made in Parliament. Minister of Citizenship and Immigration [[Jason Kenney]] said, "The apology has been given and it won't be repeated," thus settling the matter for the federal government.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.ctv.ca/servlet/ArticleNews/story/CTVNews/20080803/komogata_maru_080803/20080803?hub=Canada |title=Sikhs unhappy with PM's Komagata Maru apology - CTV News |publisher=Ctv.ca |date= |accessdate=2011-06-05}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Eurovision Song Contest 2005''' was the 50th edition of the annual [[Eurovision Song Contest]]. It took place in [[Kiev]], [[Ukraine]], following [[Ruslana]]'s win at the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|2004 Contest]] in [[Istanbul]], [[Turkey]] with the song "[[Wild Dances]]". The contest consisted of two shows: the semi-final and final, which took place on 19 and 21 May 2005, respectively, at the [[Palace of Sports (Kiev)|Palace of Sports]]. The shows were hosted by [[Maria Efrosinina]] and [[Pavlo Shylko]]. Thirty-nine countries participated, including the débuts of [[Bulgaria in the Eurovision Song Contest|Bulgaria]] and [[Moldova in the Eurovision Song Contest|Moldova]] and the return of [[Hungary in the Eurovision Song Contest|Hungary]], which was last represented in [[Eurovision Song Contest 1998|1998]].

Organizers hoped that this event would boost Ukraine's image abroad and increase [[tourism]], while the country's new [[Government of Ukraine|government]] hoped that it would also give a modest boost to the long-term goal of acquiring [[European Union]] membership.

The [[Greece in the Eurovision Song Contest 2005|winner for 2005 was Greece]] with the song "[[My Number One]]" performed by [[Helena Paparizou]], written by [[Christos Dantis]] and Natalia Germanou, both successful singer-songwriters in Greece. It scored 230 points, beating Malta into second place by a margin of 38 points. This was the first victory for Greece at the Eurovision Song Contest. Romania, Israel and Latvia rounded out the top five. The "[[Eurovision Song Contest#Big Four and Big Five|Big Four]]" countries (France, Germany, Spain and United Kingdom) ended up as the "Last Four", all placing in the bottom four position of the scoreboard in the final.

==Location==
{{details|topic=the host city|Kiev}}
[[File:Kyiv. Palace of Sports.JPG|thumb|200px|left|Palace of Sports, Kiev – host venue of the 2005 contest.]]

Kiev is the capital and largest city of [[Ukraine]], located in the north central part of the country on the [[Dnieper]]. The Palace of Sports, a multi-purpose indoor arena, was confirmed by officials as the host venue in September 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/3102/ntu_and_ebu_confirm_palats_sportu/|title=Eurovision NTU and EBU confirm: Palats Sportu - ESCToday.com|date=6 September 2004|publisher=|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, in order to host the contest, the facilities had been brought up to the standard required by the [[European Broadcasting Union]] (EBU).

At the end of December 2004, work began on the renovation 
of the hall,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/3533/renovation_of_palats_sportu_has_begun/|title=Eurovision Renovation of Palats Sportu has begun|date=26 December 2004|publisher=ESCToday.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; for which approximately 4 million francs were allocated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/4311/ntu_president_doubts_about_palats_sportu_expenses/|title=Eurovision NTU President doubts about Palats Sportu expenses|date=27 April 2005|publisher=ESCToday.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Renovation works were to be finished by 20 April,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/3910/palats_sportu_must_be_finished_by_20_april/|title=Eurovision 'Palats Sportu must be finished by 20 April'|date=27 February 2005|publisher=ESCToday.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; however, they were completed at the beginning of May.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/4362/kyiv_the_stage_is_taking_shape/|title=Eurovision Kyiv: The stage is taking shape|date=4 May 2005|publisher=ESCToday.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/4444/palats_sportu_scene_is_getting_ready/|title=Eurovision Palats Sportu scene is getting ready|date=11 May 2005|publisher=ESCToday.com|accessdate=8 April 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The arena could accommodate over 5,000 seated spectators. Additionally 2,000 press delegates were catered for.

Hotel rooms were scarce as the contest organisers asked the [[Government of Ukraine|Ukrainian government]] to put a block on bookings they did not control themselves through official delegation allocations or tour packages: this led to many people's hotel bookings being cancelled.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=John |last=Marone |publisher=''The Ukrainian Observer'' |url=http://www.ukraine-observer.com/articles/208/655 |title=Where Do We Put The Foreign Tourists? |accessdate=18 July 2006 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060204201731/http://www.ukraine-observer.com/articles/208/655 |archivedate=4 February 2006 |deadurl=yes |df=dmy }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The official logo of the contest remained the same from [[Eurovision Song Contest 2004|the 2004 contest]] with the country's flag in the heart being changed. Following [[Istanbul]]'s 'Under The Same Sky', the [[slogan]] for the 2005 show was 'Awakening', which symbolised the awakening of the country and city ready to present itself to [[Europe]]. The postcards (short clips shown between performances) for the 2005 show illustrated [[Culture of Ukraine|Ukraine’s culture]] and heritage along with a more modern and [[Industrial society|industrial]] side to the country.

The hosts of the Eurovision Song Contest in Kiev were [[television presenter]] [[Maria Efrosinina|Maria "Masha" Efrosinina]] and [[DJ]] [[Pavlo Shylko|Pavlo "Pasha" Shylko]]. Previous [[Eurovision Song Contest winners|winner]] [[Ruslana]] returned to the stage in Kiev to perform in the [[Intermission|interval]] act and to [[interview]] the contestants backstage in the '[[green room]]'. The famous Ukrainian boxers [[Vitali Klitschko|Vitali]] and [[Wladimir Klitschko]] opened the [[televoting]], while a special trophy was presented to the winner by Ukraine's [[President of Ukraine|president]], [[Viktor Yushchenko]].

==Publicity==
An official [[CD]] and [[DVD]] was released and a new introduction was an official [[Lapel pin|pin]] set, which contains heart-shaped pins with the flags of all thirty-nine participating countries. The [[EBU]] also commissioned a book "The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History" by British/American author [[John Kennedy O'Connor]] to celebrate the contest's fiftieth anniversary.&lt;ref&gt;O'Connor, John Kennedy. The Eurovision Song Contest – The Official History. Carlton Books, UK {{ISBN|978-1-84442-994-3}}&lt;/ref&gt; The book was presented on screen during the break between songs 12 and 13 (Serbia and Montenegro, Denmark). The book was published in English, German, French, Dutch, Swedish, Danish and Finnish.

During the semi final, there were a few volume falls in the sound,  most notably during the Norwegian song, shortly after the intro.  These were not fixed for the DVD release.

==Incidents==
2005 was no exception for scandals regarding the representatives from the countries participating. Germany's entrant in the Eurovision Song Contest rejected calls to quit after her producer admitted manipulating the country's pop charts with mass purchases of her single.

[[Gracia Baur]] defended her producer David Brandes, also behind Swiss entry [[Vanilla Ninja]], and said she would go to the finals in Kiev despite complaints from other German singers. Bulgaria's debut was overshadowed by a scandal. The song "[[Lorraine (song)|Lorraine]]" by [[Kaffe]] was accused of plagiarism. The song sounded too similar to another one released by Ruslan Mainov in 2001. There were also problems in Malta with the electricity supply during the contest, so TV viewers were unable to watch their national selection from the very beginning. There was a controversy regarding the Turkish entry: TRT got a false jury which led to the victory of the song [[Gülseren]], which the [[Eurovision Song Contest 2003|2003]] winner [[Sertab Erener]] said was not the best choice. There were similar controversies in [[Republic of Macedonia|Macedonia]] which led to an eventual victory for [[Martin Vučić]]. The Ukrainian song had to be changed because it would bring a political message to the people, and EBU stated that no politics could be involved in the contest. The entry for Serbia and Montenegro was also overshadowed by a scandal and an accusation of plagiarism. Portugal's entry, "[[Amar (song)|Amar]]", had very poor sound quality, with the female singer's microphone failing many times on stage.

It is also notable that the programme lasted just short of 3.5 hours. This was mainly due to the extremely long voting procedure, where 39 countries voted, reading out every single score. Many people, including [[United Kingdom]] commentator [[Terry Wogan]], noticed this and commented about the marathon-like voting procedure, when [[Russia]] voted he stated "How many more [countries] have we got to go? What time is it?". Because the show overran so badly, the [[EBU]] changed the way the votes were announced in 2006 into a much shorter method, where only the top 3 scores were read out (the rest appeared on the scoreboard automatically).

[[Ruslana]] was also intended to be a presenter for the show, but was pulled out before the contest for numerous reasons, including her poor [[English language|English]] skills. She opened the contest, and did do a few brief interviews in the green room at a few different stages in the event.

In the semifinal, the first qualifier was Hungary as shown on the card, but instead of showing Hungary's flag, it showed the bulgarian flag accidentally.

==Participating countries==

==Scoreboard==
The EBU introduced an undisclosed threshold number of [[televote]]s that would have to be registered in each voting country in order to make that country's votes valid. If that number was not reached, the country's backup jury would vote instead. In the semi-final this affected Monaco, Andorra and Albania, and Andorra, Monaco and Moldova in the final.

== Other countries ==
* {{Esc|Czech Republic}} – Czech broadcaster [[Česká televize]] (ČT) initially applied to participate in the 2005 Contest, however, the broadcaster reconsidered débuting in the contest and later withdrew their application on 3 December 2004.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/3435/czech_republic_withdraws/|title=CZECH REPUBLIC WITHDRAWS|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=3 December 2004|publisher=Esctoday.com|accessdate=13 September 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
* {{Esc|Lebanon}} – Lebanese broadcaster [[Télé Liban]] confirmed Lebanon's début in the contest and selected the song "Quand tout s'enfuit" performed by [[Aline Lahoud]] as their entry. However, the broadcaster announced their withdrawal from the competition on 18 March 2005 after the [[EBU]] informed them that the rules of the competition require them to broadcast the Israeli entry during the live show and enable viewers to vote for the nation, which contravened a Lebanese law prohibiting any acknowledgement of [[Israel]]. As the withdrawal period for the contest had passed, Télé Liban forfeited the return of their participation fee and potentially faced further fines from the EBU.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://esctoday.com/4060/breaking_news_lebanon_withdraws/|title=BREAKING NEWS: LEBANON WITHDRAWS|last=Bakker|first=Sietse|date=18 March 2005|publisher=Esctoday.com|accessdate=9 August 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

It is named after the Belgian artist, [[Barbara Dex]], who came last in the [[Eurovision 1993|1993 contest]], in which she wore her own self designed (awful) dress.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eurovisionhouse.nl/bdaward.php|title=Barbara Dex Award|last=van Thillo|first=Edwin|accessdate=24 June 2014|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160507232212/http://www.eurovisionhouse.nl/bdaward.php|archivedate=7 May 2016|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Eurovision Song Contest: Kyiv 2005''''' was the official compilation album of the 2005 Contest, put together by the European Broadcasting Union and released by [[EMI Records]] and [[CMC International]] on 2 May 2005.

A '''Falla''' or '''monumento fallero''' is an artistic monument, usually large (three to twenty meters in height, sometimes higher) composed of figures called ''[[ninots]]'', which typically encircle one or more bigger central figures, called ''remates''. The fallas are placed in the streets during the [[Falles|Falles festival]] in [[Valencia]] (Spain), and in other towns with festivals inspired by it. The monument usually deals with a [[satire|satirical]] subject connected with recent news or public controversies, and is covered in posters with words, verses and statements of a humorous nature. The monument is made with combustible materials (cardboard, wood, paper, clothing, [[expanded polystyrene]], etc.) which are then burned in the streets after being on show for a few days.

[[File:Falla del Ayuntamiento Valencia 2007.jpg|300px|thumb|Falla in Valencia.]]

==Origin and evolution ==
In medieval Valencian the word ''Falla'' named the [[torches]] that were placed on top of watchtowers. This word is derived from [[Latin]] ''Facula'', torch. In the ''[[Llibre dels fets|Llibre dels feits]]'', it is stated that the troops of King [[James I of Aragon]] carried ''Fallas'' to light their way.

The material origin of the ''monumento fallero'' was burning waste from [[carpenters]] and private homes. That is to say, it came from popular festivities and those of local guilds. It was often children who, on the eve of Saint Joseph's festivity, patron saint of the woodworkers guild, made the collection with things such as cattail chairs, old furniture, brooms or grass mats on the eve of [[Saint Joseph]]'s festivity, patron saint of the woodworkers guild.

In this, the ''fallas'' festivity was not very different from the ''[[Hogueras de San Juan]]'' (for example those in [[Alicante]]), which are held throughout Europe or the bonfires of ''Hogueras de San Antonio'' also very typical of Valencia too.

The specific quality of the Fallas comes from the fact that it is a festival of particular neighbourhoods in which locals take the opportunity to criticize each other. With the creation of the first, very rudimentary, figures, came the burlesque, satirical posters. These criticisms were often directed at the municipal power, the church or the state.

This first stage of the festivity ranges from its uncertain beginnings to the last decades of the nineteenth century. In those days the ''ninots'' were made of waste, paper, wood and cardboard.

It is around the turn of the century when the first ninots with a cloth body and a head and hands made of wax appeared. The creation of these takes a lot more work so we can say that the figure of the ''fallero'' artist is born. This period lasts until the 1920s–1930s. There is at this stage a transformation in the festivity, with the appearance of mold cardboard figures.

This technique allowed for the building of higher monuments and it has come down almost to the present day, where it is still used, especially for smaller ''ninots'' and ''fallas'' of lower budgets. An advantage inside the disadvantage of the mold technique is the possibility of making the same ''ninot'' indefinitely. Therefore, the ''fallas'' with bigger budgets made original molds every year, which were used by others at a lower price the following years. Finally, from 1990s appeared the technique of [[expanded polystyrene]] or Styrofoam. Its lighter weight allows for more height in the monuments, and requires greater innovation in design.

== Construction of the figures ==
As the monuments can be very high (often more than 10 meters), a specific technique has been developed to build them. The step is to prepare a draft and perhaps a [[scale model]] which must be approved by the ''[[comisión fallera]]'' (a committee formed by a group of people who support or finance a falla in a neighborhood of Valencia) who hires the artist.

The structure ([[scaffold]]) is constructed of wood and then all materials (cardboard, wax, cloth, etc.) are used. Though years ago they could use wire, currently these materials are prohibited by the ''[[Junta Central Fallera]]'' (which regulates and coordinates this festivity). ''Ninots'' are traditionally constructed from [[molds]], which are usually made of [[plaster]], and are filled with pulp, which are painted after drying.

But today, for convenience and ease of use, new materials are used, such as porespan, resin or fiberglass. These new materials make the monuments lighter and the ''Falla'' artists can take risks to create bold and innovative forms.

=== Criticism of new materials ===
Many people criticize these new materials, referred to as [[white cork]], since the black [[smoke]] they give off during the burning of the monument means the [[combustion]] can't be seen clearly. The pollution that these new materials cause has also been criticised in comparison with the supposedly lighter pollution from traditional materials.
The [[Polytechnic University of Valencia]] carried out a study which seems to prove that, on the contrary, white cork is less polluting than the traditional materials. The student of ''Fallas'' Manuel Sanchis Ambrós carried out a study in which he assured that even though the combustion of cork gave off more heat, the combustion of wood and liquid materials used in making a wood structure is clearly more polluting.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasprovincias.es/prensa/20070310/ediciones/crema-contamina-menos-corcho_20070310.html Noticia sobre la contaminación en Fallas]&lt;/ref&gt; A few years later (2013), the same university went back to the traditional method of ''falla'' making in view of its greater environmental sustainability.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.lasprovincias.es/20130313/comunitatvalenciana/valencia/politecnica-falla-madera-monumento-201303131841.html Noticia sobre la contaminación de las Fallas]&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Experimental changes in the ''Fallas'' ===
[[File:Manolo Martin ninot Na Jordana 2011.JPG|thumb|[[Ninot]] in tribute to Manolo Martín López, built in the 2011 Na Jordana monument by his son Manuel Martín Huguet with designs by [[Sento Llobell]].]]

During the 80's, it was, above all, the [[Valencia City Hall Square]] ''Falla''—formerly known as the [[Valencian Community]] ''Falla'', it's the only one made entirely with public money and so, it doesn't participate in the official competition—that introduced a series of experimental changes. The cartoonist [[Sento Llobell]] and the designer [[Francis Montesinos]], who dressed up ''ninots'', collaborated with the artist Manolo Martín. From this period, we recall ''Fallas'' such as that which recreated the façade of the Valencia CIty Hall or the crane that excavated the ground, finding thousands of objects.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.elpais.com/articulo/cultura/VICENT/_MANUEL/PEREZ_CASADO/_RICARD/COMUNIDAD_VALENCIANA/FALLAS/busca/cultura/perdida/elpepicul/19870315elpepicul_3/Tes Estudio de ''El País'']&lt;/ref&gt;

== Parts of a ''Falla'' ==
Although there’s not a single method to make a ''Falla'', traditionally it has been divided in the scenes at the bottom representing different situations, usually critical of an event, and bigger dolls making up the central body. Signs with some Valencian rhymes show the broad theme. The ''remate'', which represents the general theme of it, is usually a figure placed on the bigger one standing at the centre of the ''Falla''.
The special section ''Fallas'', the most important section, does not follow that exact pattern and usually have more than one ''remate''.

==  ''Fallas'' themes ==
The themes of the ''Fallas'' have changed throughout history. In the beginning, they served to criticize what happened in the neighborhoods or dealt with issues of a very local nature. But, little by little, sometimes in a hidden manner, they started to criticize people who were important locally. Since the [[Spanish transition to democracy]] the Fallas have turned to more global topics. Nowadays they criticize political and social issues from each community, national or global point of view. However, there are a lots of Fallas which make use of their satirical purpose in order to criticize banal topics like TV shows, celebrities etc.

== Types ==
Each Comisión fallera erects a large ''Falla'' and a children's one. The latter has small measurements and the ninots are smaller. Similarly, children's ''Fallas'' make use of their satirical and ironic nature in a less acute form.

[[File:Falla infantil Poeta Altet before.jpg|thumb|Photography of a children's ''Falla''.]]

== Awards ==
The Fallas monuments receive different prizes according to the categories of the Fallas and the subject matter. The most valued prize of all categories is the First Prize of all Sections. The most important prizes of each section are the first prize of section, the first one in inventiveness and grace, and the first prize to the alternative Falla. Furthermore, [[Generalitat Valenciana]], Diputación de Valencia, [[Bonfires of Saint John]] and Junta Gestora de la Magdalena, as well as other private entities also give their own prizes which often include a sum of money.

'''Gary McKinnon''' (born 10 February 1966) is a [[Scottish people|Scottish]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.scotsman.com/news/Wikileaks-US-39no-deal39-to.6645530.jp|title=Wikileaks: US 'no deal' to Gordon Brown's plea to keep Scots hacker in UK|last=Maddox|first=David|date=1 December 2010|work=The Scotsman|accessdate=1 December 2010|location=Edinburgh}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[system administrator|systems administrator]] and [[hacker (computer security)|hacker]] who was accused in 2002 of perpetrating the "biggest military computer [[Hacker (computer security)|hack]] of all time,"&lt;ref name="bbcprofile"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/technology/4715612.stm |title=Profile: Gary McKinnon |publisher=BBC News |date=30 July 2008 |first=Clark |last=Boyd |accessdate=15 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; although McKinnon himself states that he was merely looking for evidence of [[free energy suppression]] and a [[cover-up]] of [[UFO]] activity and other technologies potentially useful to the public. On 16 October 2012, after a series of legal proceedings in Britain, [[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] withdrew her [[extradition]] order to the United States.

== Alleged crime ==
McKinnon was accused of [[hacker (computer security)|hacking]] into 97 United States military and [[NASA]] computers over a 13-month period between February 2001 and March 2002, at his girlfriend's aunt's house in London,&lt;ref name="Tel profile"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/northamerica/usa/4320901/Gary-McKinnon-profile-Autistic-hacker-who-started-writing-computer-programs-at-14.html | location=London | work=The Daily Telegraph | title=Gary McKinnon profile: Autistic 'hacker' who started writing computer programs at 14 | date=23 January 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; using the name 'Solo'.&lt;ref name="bbcprofile"/&gt;

The US authorities stated he deleted critical files from operating systems, which shut down the United States Army's Military District of Washington network of 2,000 computers for 24 hours. McKinnon also posted a notice on the military's website: "Your security is crap". After the [[September 11 attacks]] in 2001, he deleted weapons logs at the [[Earle Naval Weapons Station]], rendering its network of 300 computers inoperable and paralyzing munitions supply deliveries for the [[United States Navy|US Navy]]'s Atlantic Fleet. McKinnon was also accused of copying data, account files and passwords onto his own computer. US authorities stated the cost of tracking and correcting the problems he caused was over [[United States dollar|$]]700,000.&lt;ref name="publications1"&gt;{{cite web|author=Law Lords Department|url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldjudgmt/jd080730/mckinn-1.htm|title=House of Lords - Mckinnon V Government of The United States of America and Another|publisher=Publications.parliament.uk|date=30 July 2008|quote=15. ... alleged to total over $700,000|accessdate=30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While not admitting that it constituted evidence of destruction, McKinnon did admit leaving a threat on one computer:
{{quote|US foreign policy is akin to Government-sponsored terrorism these days … It was not a mistake that there was a huge security stand down on September 11 last year{{nbsp}}... I am SOLO. I will continue to disrupt at the highest levels{{nbsp}}... &lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2007/762.html High Court judgment] s. 8&lt;/ref&gt;}}

US authorities stated that McKinnon was trying to downplay his own actions. A senior military officer at the Pentagon told ''The Sunday Telegraph'': {{quote|US policy is to fight these attacks as strongly as possible. As a result of Mr McKinnon's actions, we suffered serious damage. This was not some harmless incident. He did very serious and deliberate damage to military and Nasa computers and left silly and anti-America messages. All the evidence was that someone was staging a very serious attack on US computer systems.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Sherwell |first=Philip |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/uknews/5907994/Hacker-Gary-McKinnon-will-receive-no-pity-insists-US.html |title=Hacker Gary McKinnon will receive no pity, insists US |publisher=Telegraph |date=26 July 2009 |accessdate=30 January 2010 | location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

==Arrest and legal proceedings==
McKinnon was first interviewed by police on 19 March 2002.  After this interview, his computer was seized by the authorities.&lt;ref name="timeline"&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2009/nov/26/gary-mckinnon-extradition-timeline | location=London | work=The Guardian | title=Timeline: Gary McKinnon's fight against extradition to the US | first=David | last=Batty | date=26 November 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was interviewed again on 8 August 2002, this time by the UK [[National Hi-Tech Crime Unit]] (NHTCU).&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Senior Policeman of the Arresting Hi Tech Crime Unit team describes the prosecution of McKinnon as Spiteful |publisher=The Register |date=10 May 2010 |url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2010/05/10/mckinnon_support/}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In November 2002, McKinnon was [[Indictment|indicted]] by a [[federal grand jury]] in the [[United States District Court for the Eastern District of Virginia|Eastern District of Virginia]].&lt;ref name="indictment"&gt;[http://news.findlaw.com/hdocs/docs/cyberlaw/usmck1102vaind.pdf U.S. V. Gary McKinnon - text of Indictment] (PDF). FindLaw.com.&lt;/ref&gt;  The indictment contained seven counts of computer-related crime, each of which carried a potential ten-year jail sentence.&lt;ref name="timeline"/&gt;

===Extradition proceedings===
McKinnon remained at liberty without restriction for three years until June 2005 (until after the UK enacted the [[Extradition Act 2003]], which implemented the 2003 extradition treaty with the United States wherein the United States did not need to provide contestable evidence), when he became subject to [[bail]] conditions including a requirement to sign in at his local police station every evening and to remain at his home address at night.

If extradited to the U.S. and charged, McKinnon would have faced up to 70 years in jail.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7846442.stm |title=UK &amp;#124; Hacker wins court review decision |publisher=BBC News |date=23 January 2009 |accessdate=30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He had also expressed fears that he could be sent to [[Guantanamo Bay detention camp|Guantanamo Bay]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4712700.stm 'Hacker' extradition case reopens], BBC News, 14 February 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/4905036.stm British 'hacker' fears Guantanamo], BBC News, 12 April 2006&lt;/ref&gt;

===Appeal to the House of Lords===
Representing McKinnon in the House of Lords on 16 June 2008, [[barrister]]s told the [[Judicial functions of the House of Lords|Law Lords]] that the prosecutors had said McKinnon faced a possible 8–10 years in jail per count if he contested the charges (there were seven counts) without any chance of repatriation, but only 37–46 months if he co-operated and went voluntarily to the United States. U.S.-style plea bargains are not a part of English jurisprudence (although it is standard practice to reduce the sentence by one-third for a defendant who pleads guilty)&lt;ref&gt;''McKinnon v Government of the United States of America and another'',  section 34&lt;/ref&gt; and McKinnon's lawyers contended that in effect this was intimidation to force McKinnon to waive his legal rights. McKinnon also stated that he had been told that he could serve part of his sentence in the UK if he co-operated. He rejected the offer because the Americans would not guarantee these concessions.

McKinnon's barrister said that the [[Law Lord]]s could deny extradition if there was an [[abuse of process]]: "If the United States wish to use the processes of English courts to secure the extradition of an alleged offender, then they must play by our rules."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = Thurston | first = Richard | authorlink = | title = NASA hacker appeals to House of Lords to overturn extradition | work = | publisher = SC Magazine | date = 18 June 2008 | url = http://www.scmagazineuk.com/NASA-hacker-appeals-to-House-of-Lords-to-overturn-extradition/article/111408/| doi = | accessdate = 2 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The House of Lords rejected this argument, with the lead judgement (of [[Simon Brown, Baron Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood|Lord Brown of Eaton-under-Heywood]]) holding that "the difference between the American system and our own is not perhaps so stark as [McKinnon]'s argument suggests" and that extradition proceedings should "accommodate legal and cultural differences between the legal systems of the many foreign friendly states with whom the UK has entered into reciprocal extradition arrangements".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Law Lords Department |url=https://publications.parliament.uk/pa/ld200708/ldjudgmt/jd080730/mckinn-2.htm |title=House of Lords - Mckinnon V Government of The United States of America and Another [2008&lt;nowiki&gt;]&lt;/nowiki&gt; UKHL 59|publisher=Publications.parliament.uk |date=30 July 2008 |accessdate=30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Further appeals===
McKinnon appealed to the [[European Court of Human Rights]],&lt;ref name="Appeal 2008"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/7532713.stm |title=Hacker loses extradition appeal |publisher=BBC News |date=30 July 2008 |accessdate=15 November 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; which briefly imposed a bar on the extradition,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.homeoffice.gov.uk/media-centre/news/mckinnon-case|title=Latest on Gary McKinnon case|date=4 November 2010|publisher=Home Office|accessdate=1 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; but the request for an appeal was rejected.

On 23 January 2009, McKinnon won permission from the High Court to apply for a [[Judicial review in English law|judicial review]] against his extradition.&lt;ref&gt;[http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/7846442.stm "Hacker wins court review decision"], ''BBC News'', 23 January 2009.&lt;/ref&gt; On 31 July 2009, the High Court announced that McKinnon had lost this appeal.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWHC/Admin/2009/2021.html McKinnon, R (on the application of) v Secretary of State for Home Affairs] [2009] [[EWHC]] 2021 ([[Administrative Court (England and Wales)|Admin]]) (31 July 2009)&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/uk/8177561.stm|title=Hacker loses extradition appeal|publisher=BBC News|date=31 July 2009|accessdate=30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; McKinnon's legal team, solicitor [[Karen Todner]] and barrister Ben Cooper, applied for a judicial review into the Home Secretary's rejection of medical evidence, which stated that, when he could easily be tried in the UK, it was unnecessary, cruel and inhumane to inflict the further stress of removing him from his homeland, his family and his medical support network.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

===British government blocks extradition===
On 16 October 2012, then-[[Home Secretary]] [[Theresa May]] announced to the [[House of Commons of the United Kingdom|House of Commons]] that the extradition had been blocked, saying that:&lt;blockquote&gt;Mr McKinnon is accused of serious crimes. But there is also no doubt that he is seriously ill [...] He has [[Asperger's syndrome]], and suffers from [[depressive illness]]. Mr McKinnon's extradition would give rise to such a high risk of him ending his life that a decision to extradite would be incompatible with Mr McKinnon's human rights.&lt;/blockquote&gt;She stated that the [[Director of Public Prosecutions]] would determine whether McKinnon should face trial before a British court.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/uk-19957138 |title=Gary McKinnon extradition to US blocked by Theresa May |publisher=BBC News |date=16 October 2012 |accessdate=12 February 2017 }}&lt;/ref&gt; On 14 December, the DPP, [[Keir Starmer]], announced that McKinnon would not be prosecuted in the United Kingdom, because of the difficulties involved in bringing a case against him when the evidence was in the United States.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Kennedy|first=Maev|title=Gary McKinnon will face no charges in UK|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2012/dec/14/gary-mckinnon-no-uk-charges|accessdate=14 December 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|date=14 December 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Judicial review==
In January 2010 Mr Justice Mitting granted McKinnon a further [[judicial review]] of the decision of [[Home Secretary]] [[Alan Johnson]] to allow McKinnon’s extradition. Mitting distinguished two issues which were arguable, the first being whether psychiatrist Jeremy Turk's opinion that McKinnon would certainly commit [[suicide]] if extradited means that the Home Secretary must refuse extradition under section 6 of the [[Human Rights Act 1998]] (which prevents a public authority from acting in a way incompatible with convention rights). The second was whether Turk's opinion was a fundamental change to the circumstances that the courts had previously considered and ruled upon. Mitting ruled that if the answer to both questions was "Yes", then it was arguable that it would be unlawful to allow the extradition.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.security.nl/artikel/39229/1/NASA-hacker_McKinnon_kan_VS_toch_vermijden.html |title=NASA-hacker McKinnon kan VS toch vermijden |publisher=Security.NL |date= |accessdate=2014-07-17}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support for McKinnon==
In early November 2008, eighty British [[Member of Parliament (United Kingdom)|MPs]] signed an [[Early Day Motion]] calling for any custodial sentence imposed by an American court to be served in a prison in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/technology/7707778.stm|title=MPs want UK jail time for hacker|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=15 November 2008|date=4 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 15 July 2009, many voted in Parliament against a review of the extradition treaty.{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

In November 2008, the rock group [[Marillion]] announced that it was ready to participate in a benefit concert in support of McKinnon's struggle to avoid extradition to United States. The organiser of the planned event was Ross Hemsworth, an English radio host. No date had been set as of November 2008.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|first=Mark|last=Ballard|title=Marillion to play gig for McKinnon|url=http://www.theinquirer.net/gb/inquirer/news/2008/11/14/marillion-play-gig-mckinnon|work=[[The inquirer]]|date=14 November 2008|accessdate=17 November 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; Many prominent individuals voiced support, including [[Sting (musician)|Sting]], [[Trudie Styler]], [[Julie Christie]], [[David Gilmour]], [[Graham Nash]], [[Peter Gabriel]], [[The Proclaimers]], [[Bob Geldof]], [[Chrissie Hynde]], [[David Cameron]], [[Boris Johnson]], [[Stephen Fry]], and [[Terry Waite]]. All proposed that, at least, he should be tried in the UK.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McClatchey|first=Caroline|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/magazine/8181100.stm|title=How Gary McKinnon became a cause celebre|publisher=BBC News|date=4 August 2009|accessdate=30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In August 2009, Glasgow newspaper ''[[The Herald (Glasgow)|The Herald]]'' reported that Scots entrepreneur Luke Heron would pay £100,000 towards McKinnon's legal costs in the event he was extradited to the US.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=McArdle|first=Helen|url=http://www.heraldscotland.com/news/home-news/hacker-backer-pays-100k-to-prevent-mckinnon-us-trial-1.821225|title=Hacker backer pays £100k to prevent McKinnon US trial|work=The Herald|location=Glasgow|date=2 August 2009|accessdate=30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a further article in ''The Herald'', [[Joseph Gutheinz]], Jr., a retired NASA Office of Inspector General Senior Special Agent, voiced his support for McKinnon. Gutheinz, who is also an American criminal defence attorney and former Member of the Texas Criminal Justice Advisory Committee on Offenders with Medical and Mental Impairments, said that he feared Gary McKinnon would not find justice in the USA, because "the American judicial system turns a blind eye towards the needs of the mentally ill".{{citation needed|date=November 2015}}

Web and print media across the UK were critical of the [[extradition]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=US mil still wide open to attack, says reformed hacker|publisher=The Register|location=London, UK|date=3 September 2008|url=https://www.theregister.co.uk/2008/09/03/mckinnon_bevan_interview_analysis|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ''[[Daily Mail]]''' ran a campaign to prevent Gary McKinnon's extradition to the U.S.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-1165337/Stop-MPs-Gravy-Train---Sign-Mail-Sunday-petition.html |title=Sign the Mail on Sunday petition |language= |work=Mail Online |date=6 July 2009 |accessdate=30 January 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On 20 July 2010, Tom Bradby, [[ITN]]'s political editor, raised the Gary McKinnon issue with U.S. President [[Barack Obama]] and Prime Minister David Cameron in a joint White House press conference who responded that they had discussed it and were working to find an 'appropriate solution'.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londontv.net/cambama-v1.html|title=Tom Bradby Questions the Prime Minister and the President over Gary McKinnon|publisher=LondonTV.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londontv.net/cambama-v3.html|title=Tom Bradby (ITN) Asks hard questions of UK Prime Minister David Cameron over Gary McKinnon and the discussions he had with Obama|publisher=LondonTV.net|accessdate=16 November 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Song===
In August 2009, [[Pink Floyd]]'s [[David Gilmour]] released an online single, "Chicago - Change the World", on which he sang and played guitar, bass and keyboards, to promote awareness of McKinnon's plight. A re-titled cover of the Graham Nash song "[[Chicago (1970 song)|Chicago]]", it featured [[Chrissie Hynde]] and [[Bob Geldof]], plus McKinnon himself. It was produced by long-time Pink Floyd collaborator Chris Thomas and was made with Nash's support.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.londontv.net/freegarymckinnon.html|title=Chicago - Change the world.

== Statements to the media ==
McKinnon has admitted in many public statements that he obtained unauthorised access to computer systems in the United States including those mentioned in the United States indictment.  He states his motivation, drawn from a statement made before the Washington Press Club on 9 May 2001 by "[[The Disclosure Project]]", was to find evidence of [[UFOs]], [[antigravity]] technology, and the [[free energy suppression|suppression of "free energy"]], all of which he states to have proven through his actions.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.wired.com/news/technology/internet/0,71182-0.html?tw=rss.technology "UFO Hacker" Tells What He Found], Wired News, 21 June 2006&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="BBC Profile"&gt;{{cite news

&lt;/ref&gt; McKinnon stated that he was able to get into the military's networks simply by using a [[Perl]] script that searched for blank passwords; in other words his report suggests that there were computers on these networks with the [[default password]]s active.

In his interview with the BBC, he also stated of "The Disclosure Project" that "they are some very credible, relied-upon people, all saying yes, there is UFO technology, there's anti-gravity, there's free energy, and it's extraterrestrial in origin and [they've] captured spacecraft and reverse engineered it."  He said he investigated a NASA photographic expert's claim that at the [[Johnson Space Center]]'s Building 8, images were regularly cleaned of evidence of UFO craft, and confirmed this, comparing the raw originals with the "processed" images.  He stated to have viewed a detailed image of "something not man-made" and "cigar shaped" floating above the northern hemisphere, and assuming his viewing would be undisrupted owing to the hour, he did not think of capturing the image because he was "bedazzled", and therefore did not think of securing it with the screen capture function in the software at the point when his connection was interrupted.&lt;ref name="click"&gt;[http://bbcworld.com/content/clickonline_archive_18_2006.asp?pageid=665&amp;co_pageid=4 The NASA Hacker] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20061024221521/http://bbcworld.com/content/clickonline_archive_18_2006.asp?pageid=665&amp;co_pageid=4 |date=24 October 2006 }}, BBC Click&lt;/ref&gt;

== NASA documents ==
In 2006, a [[Freedom of Information Act (United States)|Freedom of Information Act]] request was filed with [[NASA]] for all documents pertaining to Gary McKinnon. NASA's documents consisted of printed news articles from the [[Slashdot]] site, but no other related documents.  This was consistent with NASA employees browsing internet articles about Gary McKinnon; the records of such browsing activity are in the public domain.

The FOIA documents have been uploaded to the Internet for review and can be downloaded.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.theblackvault.com/documents/ufos/nasa/garydocsnasa.pdf NASA FOIA documents related to Gary McKinnon, January 19, 2007] (PDF). theblackvault.com.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:RocktonWorldFair.jpg|thumb|upright|''[4], an annual harvest festival in Southern [[Ontario]]]]

A '''harvest festival''' is an annual [[Festival|celebration]] that occurs around the time of the main [[harvest]] of a given region
. Given the differences in climate and crops around the world, harvest festivals can be found at various times at different places. Harvest festivals typically feature feasting, both family and public, with foods that are drawn from crops that come to maturity around the time of the festival. Ample food and freedom from the necessity to work in the fields are two central features of harvest festivals: eating, merriment, contests, music and romance are common features of harvest festivals around the world.

In [[North America]], [[Canada]] and the [[US]] each have their own [[Thanksgiving]] celebrations in October and November.

In [[United Kingdom|Britain]], thanks have been given for successful harvests since [[pagan]] times. Harvest festival is traditionally held on the Sunday near or of the Harvest Moon. This is the full Moon that occurs closest to the autumn equinox (22 or 23 September). The celebrations on this day usually include singing [[hymn]]s, [[praying]], and decorating [[Church (building)|churches]] with baskets of [[fruit]] and [[food]] in the festival known as Harvest Festival, Harvest Home, Harvest Thanksgiving or Harvest Festival of Thanksgiving.

In British and English-Caribbean churches, [[chapel]]s and schools, and some Canadian churches, people bring in produce from the garden, the [[allotment (gardening)|allotment]] or farm. The food is often distributed among the poor and senior citizens of the local community, or used to raise funds for the church, or charity.

Harvest festivals in Asia include the Chinese [[Mid-Autumn Festival]] (中秋節), one of the most widely spread harvest festivals in the world. In Iran [[Mehrgan]] was celebrated in an extravagant style at Persepolis. Not only was it the time for harvest, but it was also the time when the taxes were collected. Visitors from different parts of the Persian Empire brought gifts for the king, all contributing to a lively festival. In India, [[Makar Sankranti]], [[Thai Pongal]], [[Uttarayana]], [[Lohri]], and [[Bihu#Bhogali Bihu|Magh Bihu or Bhogali Bihu]] in January, [[Holi]] in February–March, [[Vaisakhi]] in April and [[Onam]] in August–September are a few important harvest festivals.

[[Jews]] celebrate the week-long harvest festival of [[Sukkot]] in the autumn. Observant Jews build a temporary hut or shack called a [[sukkah]], and spend the week living, eating, sleeping, and praying inside of it. A sukkah has only three walls and a semi-open roof to allow the elements to enter. It is reminiscent of the structures [[Israelites|Israelite]] farmers would live in during the harvest, at the end of which they would bring a portion to the [[Temple in Jerusalem]].

== Customs and traditions ==


An early harvest festival used to be celebrated at the beginning of the harvest season on 1 August and was called [[Lammas]], meaning 'loaf Mass'. The Latin prayer to hallow the bread is given in the Durham Ritual. Farmers made loaves of bread from the fresh wheat crop. These were given to the local church as the [[Eucharist|Communion bread]] during a special service thanking God for the harvest.

By the sixteenth century a number of customs seem to have been firmly established around the gathering of the final harvest. They include the reapers accompanying a fully laden cart; a tradition of shouting "Hooky, hooky"; and one of the foremost reapers dressing extravagantly, acting as 'lord' of the harvest and asking for money from the onlookers. A play by [[Thomas Nashe]], ''[[Summer's Last Will and Testament]]'', (first published in London in 1600 but believed from internal evidence to have been first performed in October 1592 at [[Croydon]]) contains a scene which demonstrates several of these features. There is a character personifying harvest who comes on stage attended by men dressed as reapers; he refers to himself as their "master" and ends the scene by begging the audience for a "largesse". The scene is clearly inspired by contemporary harvest celebrations, and singing and drinking feature largely. The stage instruction reads:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;"Enter Haruest with a sythe on his neck, &amp; all his reapers with siccles, and a great black bowle with a posset in it borne before him: they come in singing."&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;
	 
The song which follows may be an actual harvest song, or a creation of the author's intended to represent a typical harvest song of the time:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
Merry, merry, merry, cheary, cheary, cheary,
Trowle the black bowl to me ;
Hey derry, derry, with a poupe and a lerry,
Ile trowle it again to the:

Hooky, hooky, we have shorn,
And we have bound,
And we have brought Harvest
Home to town.
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The shout of "hooky, hooky" appears to be one traditionally associated with the harvest celebration. The last verse is repeated in full after the character Harvest remarks to the audience "Is your throat cleare to helpe us sing ''hooky, hooky''?" and a stage direction adds, "Heere they all sing after him".  Also, in 1555 in [[Archbishop Parker]]'s translation of [[Psalm]] 126 occur the lines:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
"He home returnes: wyth hocky cry,
With sheaues full lade abundantly."
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

In some parts of England "Hoakey" or "[[Horkey]]" (the word is spelled variously) became the accepted name of the actual festival itself:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;
"Hoacky is brought Home with hallowing
Boys with plum-cake The Cart following".
&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Another widespread tradition was the distribution of a special cake to the celebrating farmworkers. A prose work of 1613 refers to the practice as predating the Reformation. Describing the character of a typical farmer, it says:

&lt;blockquote&gt;&lt;poem&gt;"Rocke Munday..Christmas Eve, the hoky, or seed cake, these he yeerely keepes, yet holds them no reliques of popery."&lt;ref&gt;Overbury, Thomas ''Characters'': the Franklin, London, 1613&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/poem&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Early English settlers took the idea of harvest thanksgiving to North America. The most famous one is the harvest [[Thanksgiving]] held by the [[Pilgrim (Plymouth Colony)|Pilgrims]] in 1621.
[[File:POL 2007 09 2 dozynki jasnogorskie2 01.jpg|thumb|National Harvest Thanksgiving ceremony in Poland's [[Jasna Góra]] [[Roman Catholicism in Poland|Roman Catholic]] sanctuary in [[Częstochowa]], Poland.]] 
[[File:POL Spala Dozynki Prezydenckie 2009 (4).jpg|thumb|Presidential Harvest Festival in Spała, Poland]]

Nowadays the festival is held at the end of harvest, which varies in different parts of Britain. Sometimes neighbouring churches will set the Harvest Festival on different Sundays so that people can attend each other's thanksgivings.

Until the 20th century most farmers celebrated the end of the harvest with a big meal called the harvest supper, to which all who had helped in the harvest were invited. It was sometimes known as a "Mell-supper", after the last patch of corn or wheat standing in the fields which was known as the "Mell" or "Neck". Cutting it signified the end of the work of harvest and the beginning of the feast. There seems to have been a feeling that it was bad luck to be the person to cut the last stand of corn. The farmer and his workers would race against the harvesters on other farms to be first to complete the harvest, shouting to announce they had finished. In some counties the last stand of corn would be cut by the workers throwing their sickles at it until it was all down, in others the reapers would take it in turns to be blindfolded and sweep a scythe to and fro until all of the Mell was cut down.

Some churches and villages still have a Harvest Supper. The modern British tradition of celebrating Harvest Festival in churches began in 1843, when the Reverend [[Robert Stephen Hawker|Robert Hawker]] invited parishioners to a special thanksgiving service at his church at [[Morwenstow]] in [[Cornwall]]. [[Victorian era|Victorian]] [[hymns]] such as ''[[We plough the fields and scatter]]'', ''[[Come, ye thankful people, come]]'' and ''[[All things bright and beautiful]]'' but also Dutch and German harvest hymns in translation helped popularise his idea of harvest festival, and spread the annual custom of decorating churches with home-grown produce for the Harvest Festival service. On 8 September 1854 the Revd Dr [[William Beal (writer)|William Beal]], Rector of [[Brooke, Norfolk]],&lt;ref&gt;[[Dictionary of National Biography]]&lt;/ref&gt; held a Harvest Festival aimed at ending what he saw as disgraceful scenes at the end of harvest, and went on to promote 'harvest homes' in other Norfolk villages. Another early adopter of the custom as an organised part of the [[Church of England]] calendar was Rev [[Piers Calverley Claughton|Piers Claughton]] at [[Elton, Cambridgeshire|Elton, Huntingdonshire]] in or about 1854.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first=Bob|last=Burn-Murdoch|title=What's So Special About Huntingdonshire?|location=St Ives|publisher=Friends of the Norris Museum|year=1996|isbn=0-9525900-1-8|page=24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

As British people have come to rely less heavily on home-grown produce, there has been a shift in emphasis in many Harvest Festival celebrations. Increasingly, churches have linked Harvest with an awareness of and concern for people in the [[developing world]] for whom growing crops of sufficient quality and quantity remains a struggle. Development and Relief organisations often produce resources for use in churches at harvest time which promote their own concerns for those in need across the globe.

In the early days, there were ceremonies and rituals at the beginning as well as at the end of the harvest.

''[[Encyclopædia Britannica]]'' traces the origins to "the animistic belief in the corn [grain] spirit or corn mother." In some regions the farmers believed that a spirit resided in the last sheaf of grain to be harvested. To chase out the spirit, they beat the grain to the ground. Elsewhere they wove some blades of the cereal into a "corn dolly" that they kept safe for "luck" until seed-sowing the following year.{{cn|date=November 2016}} Then they plowed the ears of grain back into the soil in hopes that this would bless the new crop.
* Church bells could be heard on each day of the harvest.
* A [[corn dolly]] was made from the last sheaf of corn harvested. The corn dolly often had a place of honour at the banquet table, and was kept until the following spring.
* In Cornwall, the ceremony of [[Crying The Neck]] was practiced. Today it is still re-enacted annually by [[Federation of Old Cornwall Societies|The Old Cornwall Society]].
* The horse bringing the last cart load was decorated with garlands of flowers and colourful ribbons.
* A magnificent Harvest feast was held at the farmer's house and games played to celebrate the end of the harvest.

'''Her Majesty's Theatre''' is a [[West End theatre]] situated on [[Haymarket, London|Haymarket]] in the [[City of Westminster]], London. The present building was designed by [[Charles J. Phipps]] and was constructed in 1897 for actor-manager [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]], who established the [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art]] at the theatre. In the early decades of the 20th century, Tree produced spectacular productions of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] and other classical works, and the theatre hosted premieres by major playwrights such as [[George Bernard Shaw]], [[J. M. Synge]], [[Noël Coward]] and [[J. B. Priestley]]. Since the [[First World War]], the wide stage has made the theatre suitable for large-scale musical productions, and the theatre has specialised in hosting [[musical theatre|musicals]]. The theatre has been home to record-setting musical theatre runs, notably the First World War sensation ''[[Chu Chin Chow]]''&lt;ref name=Guiness&gt;Larkin, Colin (ed). ''Guinness Who's Who of Stage Musicals'' (Guinness Publishing, 1994) {{ISBN|0-85112-756-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the current production, [[Andrew Lloyd Webber]]'s ''[[The Phantom of the Opera (1986 musical)|The Phantom of the Opera]]'', which has played continuously at Her Majesty's since 1986.

The theatre was established by architect and playwright [[John Vanbrugh]], in 1705, as the '''Queen's Theatre'''. Legitimate drama unaccompanied by music was prohibited by law in all but the two London [[patent theatre]]s, and so this theatre quickly became an [[opera house]].&lt;ref&gt;''theatrical monopoly'' in Banham, Martin ''The Cambridge guide to theatre'' pp. 1105 (Cambridge University Press, 1995) {{ISBN|0-521-43437-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Between 1711 and 1739, more than 25 operas by [[George Frideric Handel]] premiered here.&lt;ref&gt;D [http://gfhandel.org/composition.htm ''Handel's Compositions''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090130044046/http://gfhandel.org/composition.htm |date=30 January 2009 }} GFHandel.org, accessed 21 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; In the early 19th century, the theatre hosted the opera company that was to move to the [[Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]], in 1847, and presented the first London performances of [[Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart|Mozart]]'s ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]'', ''[[Così fan tutte]]'' and ''[[Don Giovanni]]''.&lt;ref&gt;Einstein, Alfred. ''Mozart: His Character, His Work'' (NY: Oxford University Press, 1945)&lt;/ref&gt; It also hosted the Ballet of her Majesty's Theatre in the mid-19th century, before returning to hosting the London premieres of such operas as [[Georges Bizet|Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'' and [[Richard Wagner|Wagner]]'s ''[[Ring Cycle]]''.

The name of the theatre changes with the sex of the monarch. It first became the '''King's Theatre''' in 1714 on the accession of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]]. It was renamed Her Majesty's Theatre in 1837. Most recently, the theatre was known as '''His Majesty's Theatre''' from 1901 to 1952, and it became Her Majesty's on the accession of [[Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom|Elizabeth II]]. The theatre's capacity is 1,216&amp;nbsp;seats, and the building was [[listed building|Grade II* listed]] by [[English Heritage]] in 1970. [[Really Useful Group#LW Theatres|LW Theatres]] has owned the building since 2000. The land beneath it is on a long-term lease from the [[Crown Estate]].

== History ==
[[File:John Vanbrugh.jpg|thumb|right|[[Sir John Vanbrugh]] painted by [[Godfrey Kneller]]]]
The end of the 17th century was a period of intense rivalry amongst London's actors, and in 1695 there was a split in the [[United Company]], who had a monopoly on the performance of drama at their two theatres. Dramatist and architect [[John Vanbrugh]] saw this as an opportunity to break the duopoly of the [[patent theatre]]s, and in 1703 he acquired a former stable yard, at a cost of £2,000, for the construction of a new theatre on the Haymarket. In the new business, he hoped to improve the share of profits that would go to playwrights and actors. He raised the money by subscription, probably amongst members of the [[Kit-Cat Club]]:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
To recover them [that is, [[Thomas Betterton]]'s company], therefore, to their due Estimation, a new Project was form'd of building them a stately theatre in the Hay-Market, by Sir John Vanbrugh, for which he raised a Subscription of thirty Persons of Quality, at one hundred Pounds each, in Consideration whereof every Subscriber, for his own Life, was to be admitted to whatever Entertainments should be publickly perform'd there, without farther Payment for his Entrance.

—John Vanbrugh's notice of subscription for the new theatre&lt;ref name=Brit&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=40570 ''The Haymarket Opera House'', Survey of London: volumes 29 and 30: St James Westminster, Part 1 (1960), pp. 223–50], accessed 18 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

He was joined in the enterprise by his principal associate and manager [[William Congreve]] and an actors' co-operative led by [[Thomas Betterton]].&lt;ref name=Downes&gt;Downes, Kerry. ''Sir John Vanbrugh: A Biography'' (London: Sidgwick and Jackson 1987) {{ISBN|0-283-99497-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The theatre provided the first alternative to the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]], built in 1663 and the [[Lincoln's Inn Fields|Lincoln's Inn]], founded in 1660 (forerunner of the [[Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]], built in 1728). The theatre's site is the second oldest such site in London that remains in use. These three post-[[English Interregnum|interregnum]] theatres defined the shape and use of modern theatres.&lt;ref name=Guide&gt;Earl, John and Michael Sell. ''Guide to British Theatres 1750–1950'', p. 117 (Theatres Trust, 2000) {{ISBN|0-7136-5688-3}}. [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]] was founded as a music room in 1683, and a theatre was built on the site in 1765.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Vanbrugh's theatre: 1705–1789 ===
The land for the theatre was held on a lease renewable in 1740 and was ultimately owned, as it is today, by the [[Crown Estate]]. Building was delayed by the necessity of acquiring the street frontage, and a three bay entrance led to a brick shell {{convert|130|ft|m|1}} long and {{convert|60|ft|m|1}} wide. [[Colley Cibber]] described the audience fittings as lavish but the facilities for playing poor.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

Vanbrugh and Congreve received [[Anne, Queen of Great Britain|Queen Anne]]'s authority to form ''a Company of Comedians'' on 14 December 1704, and the theatre opened as the Queen's Theatre on 9 April 1705 with imported Italian singers in ''Gli amori d'Ergasto'' (''The Loves of Ergasto''), an opera by [[Jakob Greber]], with an epilogue by Congreve. This was the first Italian opera performed in London.&lt;ref&gt;Gordon-Powell, Robin. ''Ivanhoe'', full score, Introduction, vol. I, p. VII, 2008, The Amber Ring&lt;/ref&gt;  The opera failed, and the season struggled on through May, with revivals of plays and operas.&lt;ref name=Lloyd&gt;[http://www.arthurlloyd.co.uk/HerMajestysTheatre.htm ''Her Majesty's Theatre''] Arthur Lloyd, accessed 17 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The first new play performed was ''The Conquest of Spain'' by [[Mary Pix]].&lt;ref&gt;Williamson, Marilyn L. ''Raising Their Voices: British Women Writers, 1650–1750'', pp. 109–10 (Wayne State University Press, 1990) {{ISBN|0-8143-2147-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre proved too large for actors' voices to carry across the auditorium, and the first season was a failure. Congreve departed, Vanbrugh bought out his other partners, and the actors reopened the Lincoln's Inn Fields' theatre in the summer. Although early productions combined spoken dialogue with incidental music, a taste was growing amongst the nobility for [[Italian opera]], which was completely sung, and the theatre became devoted to opera. As he became progressively more involved in the construction of [[Blenheim Palace]], Vanbrugh's management of the theatre became increasingly chaotic, showing "numerous signs of confusion, inefficiency, missed opportunities, and bad judgement".&lt;ref&gt;Milhous, Judith. ''Thomas Betterton and the Management of Lincoln's Inn Fields 1695—1708'' (Carbondale, Illinois: Southern Illinois University Press, 1979) {{ISBN|0-8093-0906-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 7 May 1707, experiencing mounting losses and running costs, Vanbrugh was forced to sell a lease on the theatre for fourteen years to [[Owen Swiny]] at a considerable loss. In December of that year, the [[Lord Chamberlain's Office]] ordered that "all Operas and other Musicall presentments be performed for the future only at Her Majesty's Theatre in the Hay Market"&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; and forbade the performance of further non-musical plays there.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

After 1709, the theatre was devoted to Italian opera and was sometimes known informally as the Haymarket Opera House.&lt;ref name=Victoria&gt;[http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/theaters/pva234.html Allingham, Philip V.

This was the first Italian opera composed specifically for the London stage. The work was well received,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.aam.co.uk/features/9901.htm Hicks, Anthony.

[[John James Heidegger]] took over the management of the theatre and, from 1719, began to extend the stage through arches into the houses to the south of the theatre.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; A "Royal Academy of Music" was formed by subscription from wealthy sponsors, including the [[George II of Great Britain|Prince of Wales]], to support Handel's productions at the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;Gibson, Elizabeth.

There were a first and second Royal Academy of Music, directed by Handel, each formed for a limited period – hence the need for two. From 1734 the Second Academy had to fight off the rival ''[[Opera of the Nobility]]''. These academies are not related to the modern [[Royal Academy of Music]] founded by [[John Fane, 11th Earl of Westmorland|Lord Burghersh]] in 1822.&lt;/ref&gt; Handel was also a partner in the management with Heidegger from 1729 to 1734, and he contributed to incidental music for theatre, including for a revival of [[Ben Jonson]]'s ''[[The Alchemist (play)|The Alchemist]]'', opening on 14 January 1710.&lt;ref&gt;''Handel: A Documentary Biography'', [[Otto Erich Deutsch]] (Black, 1955) {{ISBN|0-306-70624-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

On the accession of [[George I of Great Britain|George I]] in 1714, the theatre was renamed the King's Theatre and remained so named during a succession of male monarchs who occupied the throne. At this time only the two [[patent theatre]]s were permitted to perform serious drama in London, and lacking [[letters patent]], the theatre remained associated with opera.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/drama_tour/renaissance/restoration_patent.php ''Royal Patents'' (The Theatre Museum).] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080206114953/http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/drama_tour/renaissance/restoration_patent.php |date=6 February 2008 }} [[Victoria and Albert museum]], PeoplePlayUK, accessed 11 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; In 1762, [[Johann Christian Bach]] travelled to London to premiere three operas at the theatre, including ''Orione'' on 19 February 1763. This established his reputation in England, and he became music master to [[Queen Charlotte]].&lt;ref&gt;Scholes, Percy A. ''Johann Christian Bach'' (Biographical entry, p. 64) in ''The Oxford Companion to Music'' (Oxford University Press, 1992) {{ISBN|0-19-866212-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Richard Sheridan.jpg|thumb|Actor-manager [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]], painted by Sir [[Joshua Reynolds]]]]
In 1778, the lease for the theatre was transferred from [[James Brook]] to [[Thomas Harris (theatre manager)|Thomas Harris]], stage manager of the [[Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]], and to the playwright [[Richard Brinsley Sheridan]] for £22,000. They paid for the remodelling of the interior by [[Robert Adam]] in the same year. In November 1778, ''[[The Morning Chronicle]]'' reported that Harris and Sheridan had
&lt;blockquote&gt;
... at a considerable expence&lt;!--sic--&gt;, almost entirely new built the audience part of the house, and made a great variety of alterations, part of which are calculated for the rendering the theatre more light, elegant and pleasant, and part for the ease and convenience of the company. The sides of the frontispiece are decorated with two figures painted by [[Thomas Gainsborough|Gainsborough]], which are remarkably picturesque and beautiful; the heavy columns which gave the house so gloomy an aspect that it rather resembled a large mausoleum or a place for funeral dirges, than a theatre, are removed.

—November 1778, ''[[The Morning Chronicle]]''&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The expense of the improvements was not matched by the box office receipts, and the partnership dissolved, with Sheridan buying out his partner with a mortgage on the theatre of £12,000 obtained from the banker [[Henry Hoare]].&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

One member of the company, [[Giovanni Gallini]], had made his début at the theatre in 1753 and had risen to the position of dancing master, gaining an international reputation. Gallini had tried to buy Harris' share but had been rebuffed. He now purchased the mortgage. Sheridan quickly became bankrupt after placing the financial affairs of the theatre in the hands of William Taylor, a lawyer. The next few years saw a struggle for control of the theatre and Taylor bought Sheridan's interest in 1781. In 1782 the theatre was remodelled by [[Michael Novosielski]], formerly a scene painter at the theatre. In May 1783, Taylor was arrested by his creditors, and a forced sale ensued, with Harris purchasing the lease and much of the effects. Further legal action transferred the interests in the theatre to a board of trustees, including Novosielski. The trustees acted with a flagrant disregard for the needs of the theatre or other creditors, seeking only to enrich themselves, and in August 1785 the Lord Chamberlain took over the running of the enterprise, in the interests of the creditors. Gallini, meanwhile, had become manager. In 1788, the [[Lord Chancellor]] observed "that there appeared in all the proceedings respecting this business, a wish of distressing the property, and that it would probably be consumed in that very court to which ... [the interested parties] seemed to apply for relief".&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; Performances suffered, with the box receipts taken by Novosielski, rather than given to Gallini to run the house. Money continued to be squandered on endless litigation or was misappropriated.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; Gallini tried to keep the theatre going, but he was forced to employ amateur performers. ''The World'' described a performance as follows: "... the dance, if such it can be called was like the movements of heavy cavalry. It was hissed very abundantly."&lt;ref name=Sanquine&gt;Bondeson, Jan. ''The London Monster: A Sanguinary Tale'' (University of Pennsylvania Press, 2000) {{ISBN|0-8122-3576-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; At other times, Gallini had to defend himself against a dissatisfied audience who charged the stage and destroyed the fittings, as the company ran for their lives.&lt;ref name=Sanquine/&gt;

====Fire====
The theatre burnt down on 17 June 1789 during evening rehearsals, and the dancers fled the building as beams fell onto the stage. The fire had been deliberately set on the roof, and Gallini offered a reward of £300 for capture of the culprit.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; With the theatre destroyed, each group laid their own plans for a replacement. Gallini obtained a licence from the Lord Chamberlain to perform opera at the nearby [[Haymarket Theatre|Little Theatre]], and he entered into a partnership with [[R. B. O'Reilly]] to obtain land in [[Leicester Square|Leicester Fields]] for a new building, which too would require a licence. The two quarrelled, and each then planned to wrest control of the venture from the other. The authorities refused to grant either of them a patent for Leicester Fields, but O'Reilly was granted a licence for four years to put on opera at the [[Oxford Street]] [[Pantheon, London|Pantheon]]. This too, would burn to the ground in 1792. Meanwhile, Taylor reached an agreement with the creditors of the King's Theatre and attempted to purchase the remainder of the lease from Edward Vanbrugh, but this was now promised to O'Reilly. A further complication arose as the theatre needed to expand onto adjacent land that now came into the possession of a Taylor supporter. The scene was set for a further war of attrition between the lessees, but at this point O'Reilly's first season at the Pantheon failed miserably, and he fled to Paris to avoid his creditors.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

By 1720, Vanbrugh's direct connection with the theatre had been terminated, but the leases and rents had been transferred to both his own family and that of his wife's through a series of trusts and benefices, with Vanbrugh himself building a new home in [[Greenwich]]. After the fire, the Vanbrugh family's long association with the theatre was terminated, and all their leases were surrendered by 1792.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

=== Second theatre: 1791–1867 ===

Taylor completed a new theatre on the site in 1791. Michael Novosielski had again been chosen as architect for the theatre on an enlarged site, but the building was described by Malcolm in 1807 as
&lt;blockquote&gt;
fronted by a stone basement in rustic work, with the commencement of a very superb building of the Doric order, consisting of three pillars, two windows, an entablature, pediment, and balustrade. This, if it had been continued, would have contributed considerably to the splendour of London; but the unlucky fragment is fated to stand as a foil to the vile and absurd edifice of brick pieced to it, which I have not patience to describe.

—The critic Malcolm, quoted in ''Old and New London'' (1878)&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.british-history.ac.uk/report.aspx?compid=45193 "The Haymarket".] ''Old and New London'': Volume 4 (1878), pp. 216–26, accessed 18 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The Lord Chamberlain, a supporter of O'Reilly, refused a performing licence to Taylor. The theatre opened on 26 March 1791 with a private performance of song and dance entertainment, but was not allowed to open to the public. The new theatre was heavily indebted and spanned separate plots of land that were leased to Taylor by four different owners on differing terms of revision. As a later manager of the theatre wrote, "In the history of property, there has probably been no parallel instance wherein the legal labyrinth has been so difficult to thread."&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; Meetings were held at [[Carlton House, London|Carlton House]] and Bedford House attempting to reconcile the parties. On 24 August 1792 a General Opera Trust Deed was signed by the parties. The general management of the theatre was to be entrusted to a committee of noblemen, appointed by the [[George IV of the United Kingdom|Prince of Wales]], who would then appoint a general manager. Funds would be disbursed from the profits to compensate the creditors of both the King's Theatre and the Pantheon. The committee never met, and management devolved to Taylor.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

The first public performance of opera in the new theatre took place on 26 January 1793, the dispute with the Lord Chamberlain over the licence having been settled. This theatre was, at that time, the largest in England, and it became the home of the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]] company while that company's home theatre was itself rebuilt between 1791–94.&lt;ref&gt;Milhous Judith, Dideriksen, Gabriella and Hume, Robert D.

From 1793, seven small houses at the east side of the theatre fronting on the Haymarket were demolished and replaced by a large concert room. It was in this room that [[Joseph Haydn]] gave a series of concerts, under the sponsorship of [[Johann Peter Salomon]], on his second visit to London in 1794–95.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;On Haydn's previous visit, the concerts had been presented at the Hanover Square Rooms with tremendous success.

With the departure of the Drury Lane company in 1794, the theatre returned to opera, hosting the first London performances of [[Mozart]]'s ''[[La clemenza di Tito]]'' in 1806, ''[[Così fan tutte]]'' and ''[[The Magic Flute|Die Zauberflöte]]'' in 1811, and ''[[Don Giovanni]]'' in 1816. Between 1816 and 1818, [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash]] and George Repton made alterations to the façade and increased the capacity of the auditorium to 2,500.

[[John Ebers]], a bookseller, took over the management of the theatre in 1821, and seven more London premieres of Rossini operas (''[[La gazza ladra]], [[Il turco in Italia]], [[Mosè in Egitto]], [[Otello (Rossini)|Otello]], [[La donna del lago]]'', ''[[Matilde di Shabran]]'' and ''[[Ricciardo e Zoraide]]'') took place there in the following three years.&lt;ref name=Viking/&gt; Ebers sublet the theatre to Giambattista Benelli in 1824, and Rossini was invited to conduct, remaining for a five-month season, with his wife [[Isabella Colbran]] performing.&lt;ref&gt;Fenner, Theodore ''Opera in London: Views of the Press 1785–1830'' pp. 144–57 (Southern Illinois University Press, 1994) {{ISBN|0-8093-1912-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Porter, Andrew ''A Lost Opera by Rossini'', ''Music &amp; Letters'', Vol. 45, No. 1 (January 1964), pp. 39–44&lt;/ref&gt; Two more of his operas, ''[[Zelmira]]'' and ''[[Semiramide]]'', received their British premieres during the season, but the theatre sustained huge losses and Benelli absconded without paying either the composer or the artists. Ebers engaged [[Giuditta Pasta]] for the 1825 season, but he became involved in lawsuits which, combined with a large increase in the rent of the theatre, forced him into bankruptcy, after which he returned to his bookselling business.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sadie|first=Stanley (ed)|year=1992|title=The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]| publisher = Oxford University Press|location = Oxford|pages = vol 2, p. 4|isbn=978-0-19-522186-2 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Pierre François Laporte ====
[[File:Illustrirte Zeitung (1843) 21 329 1 Die königliche Loge in der italienischen Oper in London.PNG|thumb|The royal box]]
In 1828, Ebers was succeeded as theatre manager by Pierre François Laporte, who held the position (with a brief gap in 1831–33) until his death in 1841. Two of Rossini's Paris operas (''[[Le comte Ory]]'' and ''[[Le siège de Corinthe]]'') had their British premieres at the theatre during this period, and Laporte was also the first to introduce the operas of [[Vincenzo Bellini]] (''[[La sonnambula]], [[Norma (opera)|Norma]]'' and ''[[I puritani]]'') and [[Gaetano Donizetti]] (''[[Anna Bolena]], [[Lucia di Lammermoor]]'' and ''[[Lucrezia Borgia (opera)|Lucrezia Borgia]]'') to the British public. Under Laporte, singers such as [[Giulia Grisi]], [[Pauline Viardot]], [[Giovanni Battista Rubini]], [[Luigi Lablache]] and [[Mario (tenor)|Mario]] made their London stage debuts at the theatre.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Sadie|first=Stanley (ed)|year=1992|title=The [[New Grove Dictionary of Opera]]| publisher = Oxford University Press|location = Oxford|pages = vol 2, p. 1101|isbn=978-0-19-522186-2 |nopp=true}}&lt;/ref&gt; Among the musical directors of this period was [[Nicolas Bochsa]], the celebrated and eccentric French harpist. He was appointed in 1827 and remained for six years at this position.&lt;ref&gt;Faul, Michel. ''Nicolas-Charles Bochsa, harpiste, compositeur, escroc'' (editions Delatour France, 2003)&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Victoria of the United Kingdom|Queen Victoria]] ascended the throne in 1837, the name of the theatre was changed to Her Majesty's Theatre, Italian Opera House. In the same year, [[Samuel Phelps]] made his London début as [[Shylock]] in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' at the theatre, also playing in other [[Shakespeare]]an plays here.&lt;ref&gt;Allen, Shirley S. ''Samuel Phelps and Sadler's Wells Theatre'' (Wesleyan, 1971) {{ISBN|0-8195-4029-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Over the course of the 1840s, [[Dion Boucicault]] had five plays produced here: ''The Bastile'' [sic], an "after-piece" (1842), ''Old Heads and Young Hearts'' (1844), ''The School for Scheming'' (1847), ''Confidence'' (1848), and ''The Knight Arva'' (1848). In 1853, [[Robert Browning]]'s ''Colombe's Birthday'' played at the theatre.&lt;ref name=Victoria/&gt;

In 1841, disputes arose over Laporte's decision to replace the [[baritone]] [[Antonio Tamburini]] with a new singer, Colletti. The audience stormed the stage, and the performers formed a 'revolutionary conspiracy'.

==== Benjamin Lumley ====
[[File:Image-Jenny Lind Lithograph 2.jpg|thumb|right|[[Jenny Lind]], ''The Swedish Nightingale'', 1850]]
Laporte died suddenly, and [[Benjamin Lumley]] took over the management in 1842, introducing London audiences to Donizetti's late operas, ''[[Don Pasquale]]'' and ''[[La fille du régiment]]''. Initially, relations between Lumley and [[Michael Costa (conductor)|Michael Costa]], the principal conductor at Her Majesty's were good. [[Verdi]]'s ''[[Ernani]]'', ''[[Nabucco]]'' and ''[[I Lombardi]]'' received their British premieres in 1845–46, and Lumley commissioned ''[[I masnadieri]]'' from the composer. This opera received its world premiere on 22 July 1847, with the Swedish operatic diva [[Jenny Lind]] in the role of Amalia, and the British premieres of two more Verdi operas, ''[[I due Foscari]]'' and ''[[Attila (opera)|Attila]]'', followed in 1847–48.&lt;ref name=Viking2&gt;{{cite book |editor1-last = Holden |editor1-first = Amanda |editor2-last=Kenyon|editor2-first=Nicholas|editor3-last=Walsh|editor3-first=Stephen |title = The Viking Opera Guide |year = 1993 |publisher = Viking |location = London |isbn = 0-670-81292-7 |pages = 1126–43}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meanwhile, the performers had continued to feel neglected and the disputes continued. In 1847, Costa finally transferred his opera company to the [[Royal Opera House|Theatre Royal, Covent Garden]], and the theatre relinquished the sobriquet, 'Italian Opera House', to assume its present title, Her Majesty's Theatre.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.royaloperahouse.org/AbouttheHouse/Index.cfm?ccs=288&amp;cs=1017&amp;SubNavMenu=7&amp;login=0 ''Discover the History of the Royal Opera House''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080330211124/http://info.royaloperahouse.org/AbouttheHouse/Index.cfm?ccs=288&amp;cs=1017&amp;SubNavMenu=7&amp;login=0 |date=30 March 2008 }} Royal Opera House, accessed 18 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt;

Lumley engaged [[Michael William Balfe|Michael Balfe]] to conduct the orchestra&lt;ref&gt;Walsh, Basil. [http://www.victorianweb.org/mt/balfe/bio1.html ''Michael W. Balfe (1808–1870): His Life and Career''.] Victorian Web, accessed 7 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and entered negotiations with [[Felix Mendelssohn]] for a new opera. Jenny Lind had made her English début on 4 May 1847 in the role of Alice in [[Giacomo Meyerbeer]]'s ''[[Robert le Diable (opera)|Robert le Diable]]'', in the presence of the Royal family and the composer [[Felix Mendelssohn]]. Such was the press of people around the theatre that many "arrived at last with dresses crushed and torn, and coats hanging in shreds, having suffered bruises and blows in the struggle".&lt;ref name=Headland/&gt; She performed for a number of acclaimed seasons at the theatre, interspersed with national tours, becoming known as the ''Swedish Nightingale''.&lt;ref name=Headland&gt;Headland, Helen ''The Swedish Nightingale: A Biography of Jenny Lind'' (Kessinger Publishing, 2005) {{ISBN|1-4191-5538-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The secession of the orchestra to Covent Garden was a blow, and the theatre closed in 1852, re-opening in 1856, when a fire closed its rival.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; After the reopening, Lumley presented two more British premieres of Verdi operas: ''[[La traviata]]'' in 1856 and ''[[Luisa Miller]]'' in 1858.&lt;ref name=Viking2/&gt;

From the early 1830s until the late 1840s Her Majesty's Theatre played host to the heyday of the era of the [[romantic ballet]], and the theatre's resident ballet company was considered the most renowned in Europe, aside from the [[Ballet du Théâtre de l'Académie Royale de Musique]] in Paris. The celebrated ballet master [[Jules Perrot]] began staging ballet at Her Majesty's in 1830. Lumley appointed him ''Premier Maître de Ballet'' (chief choreographer) to the theatre in 1842.&lt;ref name=Guest&gt;Guest, Ivor Forbes. ''The Romantic Ballet in England'', Wesleyan University Press, 1972&lt;/ref&gt; Among the works of ballet that he staged were ''[[Ondine (Perrot)|Ondine, ou La Naïade]]'' (1843), ''[[La Esmeralda (ballet)|La Esmeralda]]'' (1844), and ''[[Catarina or La Fille du Bandit|Catarina, ou La Fille du Bandit]]'' (1846), as well as the celebrated [[divertissement]] ''[[Pas de Quatre]]'' (1845). Other ballet masters created works for the ballet of Her Majesty's Theatre throughout the period of the romantic ballet, most notably [[Paul Taglioni]] (son of [[Filippo Taglioni]]), who staged ballets including ''Coralia, ou Le Chevalier inconstant'' (1847) and ''Electra'' (1849, the first production of a ballet to make use of electric lighting).&lt;ref name=Guest/&gt; [[Arthur Saint-Léon]] staged such works as ''[[La Vivandière]]'' (1844), ''Le Violin du Diable'' (1849), and ''Le Jugement de Pâris'' (1850), which was considered a sequel of sorts to ''Pas de Quatre''.&lt;ref name=Guest/&gt;

The Italian composer [[Cesare Pugni]] was appointed ''Composer of the Ballet Music'' to the theatre in 1843, a position created for him by Lumley. From 1843 until 1850, he composed nearly every new ballet presented at the theatre.&lt;ref name=Guest/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.nypl.org/research/lpa/italiandance/web4.html ''500 Years of Italian Dance''.] [[New York Public Library]], accessed 18 February 2008 {{webarchive |url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080207013614/http://www.nypl.org/research/lpa/italiandance/web4.html |date=7 February 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Pugni remains the most prolific composer of the genre, having composed more than 100 original ballets, as well as composing numerous divertissements and incidental dances that were often performed as diversions during the intermissions of opera performances at the theatre.&lt;ref name=Guest/&gt; Throughout the era of the romantic ballet, the theatre presented performances by notable [[ballerina]]s, including [[Marie Taglioni]], [[Carlotta Grisi]], [[Fanny Elssler]], [[Lucile Grahn]], and [[Fanny Cerrito]], performing in the works of Perrot, Taglioni and Saint-Léon.&lt;ref name=Guest/&gt;&lt;ref name=Edgecombe&gt;Edgecombe, Rodney Stenning.

[[File:Her Majesty's Theatre in 1867.jpg|right|thumb|300px|The theatre burned down in 1867.]]
From 1862 to 1867, the theatre was managed by [[James Henry Mapleson]], presenting Italian, French and German opera, including the British premieres of ''[[La forza del destino]]'', ''[[Médée (Cherubini)|Médée]]'', ''[[Faust (opera)|Faust]]'' and ''[[The Merry Wives of Windsor (opera)|The Merry Wives of Windsor]]'' and promoting such singers as Mario, Giulia Grisi, [[Ema Pukšec|De Murska]], [[Thérèse Tietjens]], [[Antonio Giuglini]], [[Charles Santley]] and [[Christine Nilsson]].&lt;ref name=Maple&gt;Mapleson, J. H. ''The Mapleson Memoirs'', ed. H. Rosenthal, (London, 1966)&lt;/ref&gt; On the night of 6 December 1867, the theatre was destroyed by fire, thought to have been caused by an overheated stove. Only the bare walls of the theatre remained, and most of the adjacent shops in Pall Mall, and the Clergy Club hotel in Charles Street, suffered damage of varying severity. The Royal Opera Arcade, on the western side, survived with only superficial damage. With the destruction of the theatre, Mapleson took his company to the [[Theatre Royal, Drury Lane]].&lt;ref name=Maple/&gt;

By the 1850s, with the era of the romantic ballet at an end, the principal personalities of the ballet, such as Perrot, Saint-Léon, Taglioni, and the composer Pugni, joined the [[Nicholas I of Russia|Tsar's]] [[Mariinsky Ballet|Imperial Ballet]] of [[St. Petersburg, Russia]]. Ballet in London went through a considerable decline beginning with the fire at Her Majesty's Theatre, a decline that lasted until the end of the 19th century.&lt;ref&gt;Ballet continued to be performed in London, but in the [[Music hall]]s and theatres as interludes and endpieces. The most notable of these were the corps at the [[Alhambra Theatre|Alhambra]], and its nearby rival, the [[Empire, Leicester Square|Empire Theatre]].&lt;/ref&gt; Ballet in London was not resurrected until the early 20th century, when such dancers as [[Adeline Genée]] began performing.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/dance_tour/ballet/romantic_intro.php ''Romantic Ballet''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071207220442/http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/dance_tour/ballet/romantic_intro.php |date=7 December 2007 }} PeoplePlayUK, accessed 18 December 2007&lt;/ref&gt; The theatre's ballet company found a new home at the [[Old Vic]] and soon took on the name of the [[Vic-Wells Ballet]]. Later, moving primarily to the [[Sadler's Wells Theatre]], the company became known as the Sadler's Wells Ballet. Eventually the troupe began performing at the [[Royal Opera House]] and became the [[Royal Ballet, London|Royal Ballet]], as it is known today.&lt;ref&gt;[http://info.royaloperahouse.org/ballet/index.cfm?ccs=473 ''History of The Royal Ballet''.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20040422121540/http://info.royaloperahouse.org/ballet/index.cfm?ccs=473 |date=22 April 2004 }} Royal Opera House, accessed 11 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Third theatre: 1868–1896 ===
[[File:Carl Rosa 1.png|thumb|left|[[Carl Rosa]]'s opera company performed at the third theatre.]]
A third building was constructed in 1868 at a cost of £50,000, within the shell of the old theatre, for [[William Ward, 1st Earl of Dudley|Lord Dudley]]. It was designed by Charles Lee and Sons and their partner, William Pain. They had taken over [[John Nash (architect)|John Nash's]] practice on his retirement. The new theatre was designed to be less susceptible to fire, with brick firewalls, iron roof trusses and Dennett's patent gypsum-cement floors.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; The auditorium had four tiers, with a stage large enough for the greatest spectaculars. For opera, the theatre seated 1,890, and for plays, with the orchestra pit removed, 2,500. As a result of a dispute over the rent between Dudley and Mapleson,&lt;ref&gt;[https://timesmachine.nytimes.com/timesmachine/1874/01/11/79212755.pdf "English Gossip".] ''[[New York Times]]'', 23 December 1873, accessed 31 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; and a decline in the popularity of ballet, the theatre remained dark until 1874, when it was sold to a [[Revivalism|Revivalist Christian]] group for £31,000.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

Mapleson returned to Her Majesty's in 1877 and 1878, after a disastrous attempt to build a 2,000-seat National Opera House on a site subsequently used for the building of [[Scotland Yard]]. On the return of the company, all the fittings of the theatre had been removed, including the seats, carpets and even the wallpaper. £6,000 was spent on fitting out the theatre, and on 28 April 1877 the building returned to theatrical use with the opening of [[Vincenzo Bellini]]'s opera ''[[Norma (opera)|Norma]]''. The London premiere of [[Bizet]]'s ''[[Carmen]]'' occurred here on 22 June 1878, and in subsequent seasons the theatre hosted the [[Carl Rosa Opera Company]] (Rosa's wife, [[Euphrosyne Parepa-Rosa|Euphrosyne Parepa]], had made her name in opera partly at Her Majesty's) and a programme of French plays and [[light opera]]. The company was the first to produce ''Carmen'' in English, at the theatre in February 1879, starring [[Selina Dolaro]] in the title role and [[Durward Lely]] as Don José.&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 254&lt;/ref&gt;  In 1882, the theatre hosted the London premieres of [[Wagner]]'s ''[[Ring cycle]]''.&lt;ref name=Lloyd/&gt;

Mapleson returned in 1887 and 1889, but ''[[The Times]]'' commented that the repertoire comprised "works that had long ceased to attract a large public, the singers were exclusively of second-rate quality, and the standard of performance was extremely low".&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; ''[[Rigoletto]]'', on 25 May 1889, was the last operatic performance given in the house.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt;

== Phipps' theatre: 1897–present ==
[[File:Beerbohm tree wolsey 1910.jpeg|right|upright|thumb|[[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] as [[Thomas Wolsey|Cardinal Wolsey]] at the theatre, in a 1910 photograph]]
With the rapid advances in theatre technology made during this period, the 1868 theatre quickly became outmoded, and the sub-lease of the theatre, still held by the Dudley family, was due to expire in 1891. The [[Commissioners of Woods, Forests and Land Revenues]] (forerunners of the [[Crown Estate]]) desired the entire block on which the theatre stood to be rebuilt, except for the Royal Arcade, where the lease did not expire until 1912. Problems were encountered in obtaining all the buildings and in financing the scheme, but the theatre and surrounding buildings were demolished in 1892. Plans were commissioned from architect [[Charles J. Phipps]] for a theatre and a hotel. In February 1896 an agreement was reached with [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] for the erection of the theatre at a cost of £55,000. The plans were approved in February 1897, and on 16 July 1896, the foundation stone of the new theatre was laid.&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; Phipps died in 1897, and the theatre was his last work.&lt;ref name=EH&gt;{{IoE|210129|Her Majesty's Theatre|accessdate=28 April 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Architecture ===
[[File:Hedley Fitton09.jpg|thumb|left|Phipps' new theatre]]
The theatre was designed as a symmetrical pair with the [[Carlton Hotel, London|Carlton Hotel]] and restaurant on the adjacent site, now occupied by New Zealand House.&lt;ref&gt;The Carlton Hotel, opened in 1899 by the chef [[Auguste Escoffier]] and hotelier [[César Ritz]] after they left the [[Savoy Hotel]], introduced the ''[[à la carte]] menu''.&lt;/ref&gt; The frontage formed three parts, each of nine bays. The hotel occupied two parts, the theatre one, and the two buildings were unified by a cornice above the ground floor. The buildings rose to four storeys, with attic floors above, surmounted by large squared domes in a style inspired by the [[French Renaissance]]. The theatre has a [[Corinthian Order|Corinthian]] colonnade at the first floor, rising to the second, forming a loggia in front of the circle foyer. This is above a canopy over the main ground floor entrances.&lt;ref name=EH/&gt; The theatre lies on an east–west axis. The stage at the western end was {{convert|49|ft|m|1}} deep and {{convert|69.5|ft|m|1}} wide,&lt;ref name=Brit/&gt; and reputedly the first to be flat, rather than raked.&lt;ref name=Guide/&gt; The interior was designed by the consulting architect, [[W. H. Romaine-Walker]] (1854–1940), after the Opera at [[Palace of Versailles|Versailles]] by [[Ange-Jacques Gabriel|Gabriel]]. Stalls and the pit were entered at ground level, with two partly cantilevered tiers above accommodating dress and family circles on the first level, and upper circle, amphitheatre and gallery on the tier above. In all, there were 1,319&amp;nbsp;seats. Contemporary opinion was critical of the project. Edwin Sachs wrote in his 1897 guide to theatres, "The treatment is considered to be in the French Renaissance style and stone has been used throughout. The detail cannot, however, be termed satisfactory, nor does the exterior architecturally express the purpose of the building."&lt;ref&gt;Sachs, Edwin O. ''Modern Opera Houses and Theatres'' vol. ii, p. 36 (London, 1897) (Reprint Ayer Co Pub., 1968) {{ISBN|0-405-08906-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Modern opinion of the theatre is more generous, with [[English Heritage]] describing the building as both Phipps' finest work and one of the best planned theatres in London. The building was [[listed building|Grade II* listed]] in January 1970.&lt;ref name=EH/&gt; Appreciation of the buildings came too late to save the adjacent hotel from redevelopment as the new High Commission for New Zealand, completed in 1963 by British architects [[Robert Matthew]], Johnson Marshall and Partners, who also designed the [[Commonwealth Institute]]. In 1995, this too was Grade II listed as a fine example of 1960s architecture.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.c20society.org.uk/docs/building/newzealand.html New Zealand House, Haymarket.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080319001327/http://www.c20society.org.uk/docs/building/newzealand.html |date=19 March 2008 }} The 20th century Society, accessed 31 January 2008&lt;/ref&gt; The 200-year-old Royal Opera Arcade, built by Nash and Repton, is all that survives of the second theatre and is the earliest example of a London arcade.&lt;ref&gt;Jones, Edward, and Christopher Woodward.

=== Performance ===
[[File:Cover-play1913.jpg|thumb|right|Shaw's ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'' ran at the theatre in 1914, starring [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]] as Eliza.]]
The current theatre opened on 28 April 1897. Herbert Beerbohm Tree built the theatre with profits from his tremendous success at the [[Haymarket Theatre]],&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Beerbohm Tree obituary, ''[[The Times]]'', 3 July 1917, p. 11&lt;/ref&gt; and he owned, managed and lived in the theatre from its construction until his death in 1917. For his personal use, he had a banqueting hall and living room installed in the massive, central, square French-style dome.&lt;ref name=EH/&gt; This building did not specialise in opera, although there were some operatic performances in its early years. The theatre opened with a dramatisation of [[Gilbert Parker]]'s ''[[The Seats of the Mighty]]''. Adaptations of novels by [[Dickens]], [[Tolstoy]], and others formed a significant part of the repertoire, along with classical works from [[Molière]] and [[Shakespeare]]. The theatre also hosted the world premiere of [[J. M. Synge]]'s ''[[The Tinker's Wedding]]'' on 11 November 1909&lt;ref&gt;Synge, J. M. ''The Complete Plays'' (1st. New York: Vintage Books, 1935)&lt;/ref&gt; and [[George Bernard Shaw]]'s ''[[Pygmalion (play)|Pygmalion]]'', with Tree as Henry Higgins and [[Mrs Patrick Campbell]] as Eliza, in 1914.&lt;ref name=HBTree&gt;[http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/drama_tour/19th_century/managers_tree.php Herbert Beerbohm Tree.] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20071202103125/http://www.peopleplayuk.org.uk/guided_tours/drama_tour/19th_century/managers_tree.php |date=2 December 2007 }} PeoplePlayUK, accessed 12 February 2008&lt;/ref&gt; Tree's productions were known for their elaborate and spectacular scenery and effects, often including live animals and real grass.&lt;ref name=HBTree/&gt; These remained both popular and profitable, but in his last decade, Tree's acting style was seen as increasingly outmoded, and many of his plays received bad reviews. Tree defended himself from critical censure, demonstrating his continuing popularity at the box office until his death.&lt;ref&gt;Hoenselaars, A. J.

[[File:Asche in Chu Chin Chow.jpg|left|thumb|[[Oscar Asche]] in ''[[Chu Chin Chow]]''. Its record-breaking run of 2,235 performances at the theatre began in 1916.]]
In 1904, Tree founded the Academy of Dramatic Art (later [[Royal Academy of Dramatic Art|RADA]]), which spent a year based in the theatre before moving in 1905 to [[Gower Street (London)|Gower Street]] in [[Bloomsbury Publishing|Bloomsbury]]. Tree continued to take graduates of the Academy into his company at His Majesty's, employing some 40 actors in this way by 1911.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rada.org/history.html |title=RADA History |work=Royal Academy of Dramatic Art|archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080126091704/http://www.rada.org/history.html |archivedate = 26 January 2008|deadurl=yes}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Definitions==
[[Human Rights Watch]] defines "honor killings" as follows:

&lt;blockquote&gt;Honor killings are acts of vengeance, usually death, committed by male family members against female family members, who are held to have brought dishonor upon the family. A woman can be targeted by (individuals within) her family for a variety of reasons, including: refusing to enter into an [[arranged marriage]], being the victim of a [[sexual assault]], seeking a divorce—even from an [[domestic violence|abusive]] husband—or (allegedly) committing [[adultery]]. The mere perception that a woman has behaved in a way that "dishonors" her family is sufficient to trigger an attack on her life.&lt;ref name = "HRW"&gt;{{cite web|title=Violence Against Women and "Honor" Crimes|url=https://www.hrw.org/press/2001/04/un_oral12_0405.htm|publisher=''[[Human Rights Watch]]''|accessdate=6 April 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

Although rare, men can also be the victims of honor killings by members of the family of a woman with whom they are perceived to have an inappropriate relationship.&lt;ref&gt;[http://english.aljazeera.net/news/middleeast/2010/08/2010816171115397111.html Afghan couple stoned to death – Central &amp; South Asia].

In some cases of honor killing that were brought before German courts murder charges have been reduced to [[manslaughter]]. This has been called the "honor defense".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| publisher = Bloomsbury Publishing| isbn = 978-1-84731-481-9| last1 = Foblets| first1 = Marie-Claire| last2 = Renteln| first2 = Alison Dundes| title = Multicultural Jurisprudence: Comparative Perspectives on the Cultural Defense| date = 2009-01-16 |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=nv7bBAAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA241}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==General characteristics==
The distinctive nature of honor killings is the collective nature of the crime – many members of an extended family plan the act together, sometimes through a formal "family council". Another significant feature is the connection of honor killings to the control of individual's behavior, in particular in regard to sexuality/marriage, by the family as a collective. Another key aspect is the importance of the reputation of the family in the community, and the stigma associated with losing social status, particularly in tight-knit communities.&lt;ref name="hbv-awareness.com"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbv-awareness.com/faq/ |title=FAQ |publisher=Hbv-awareness.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another characteristic of honor killings is that the perpetrators often do not face negative stigma within their communities, because their behavior is seen as justified.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/cj-jp/fv-vf/hk-ch/p1.html |title=Introduction – Preliminary Examination of so-called Honour Killings in Canada |publisher=Justice.gc.ca |date= 2013-09-24|accessdate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Extent==
The incidence of honor killings is very difficult to determine and estimates vary widely. In most countries data on honor killings is not collected systematically, and many of these killings are reported by the families as [[suicides]] or [[accidents]] and registered as such.&lt;ref name="unicef.org.tr"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unicef.org.tr/en/content/detail/74/honour-crimes-and-forced-suicides-2.html |title=UNICEF Turkey: Protective Environment for Children; Honour Crimes and Forced Suicides |publisher=unicef.org.tr |accessdate=23 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131202235026/http://www.unicef.org.tr/en/content/detail/74/honour-crimes-and-forced-suicides-2.html |archivedate= 2 December 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/212/readings/honor-kil-ng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Holt |first=Gerry |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-27619669 |title=BBC News – Why do families kill their daughters? |publisher=Bbc.com |date=2014-05-29 |accessdate=2015-02-15|work=BBC News }}&lt;/ref&gt; Although honor killings are often associated with [[Asia|the Asian continent]], especially the [[Middle East]] and [[South Asia]], they occur all over the world.&lt;ref&gt;http://www1.umn.edu/humanrts/svaw/advocacy/modelsessions/what_is_GBV.PDF&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/honor_killings_fact_sheet_final_2012.doc |title=Honor Killings: Amnesty USA |publisher=webcache.googleusercontent.com |accessdate=23 December 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141114044529/http://www.amnestyusa.org/sites/default/files/pdfs/honor_killings_fact_sheet_final_2012.doc |archivedate=14 November 2014 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2000, the [[United Nations]] estimated that 5,000 women were victims of honor killings each year.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/8301-504083_162-57409395-504083/honor-killing-under-growing-scrutiny-in-the-u.s/ |title="Honor killing" under growing scrutiny in the U.S. – Crimesider |publisher=CBS News |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to BBC, "Women's advocacy groups, however, suspect that more than 20,000 women are killed worldwide each year."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Maher |first=Ahmed |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-22992365 |title=Many Jordan teenagers 'support honour killings' |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=20 June 2013 |accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Murder is not the only form of honor crime, other crimes such as [[Acid throwing|acid attacks]], abduction, mutilations, and beatings occur; in 2010 the UK police recorded at least 2,823 such crimes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/uk-16014368 |title='Honour' attack numbers revealed by UK police forces |publisher=bbc.co.uk |date=3 December 2011 |accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Methods==
Methods of killing include stoning, stabbing, beating, burning, beheading, hanging, throat slashing, lethal acid attacks, shooting and strangulation.&lt;ref name="genevadeclaration.org"&gt;{{cite web|title=Femicide: A Gobal Issue that demands Action|url=http://www.genevadeclaration.org/fileadmin/docs/Co-publications/Femicide_A%20Gobal%20Issue%20that%20demands%20Action.pdf|website=Genevadeclaration.org|publisher=Academic Council on the United Nations System|page=60|accessdate=20 May 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; The murders are sometimes performed in public to warn the other individuals within the community of possible consequences of engaging in what is seen as illicit behavior.&lt;ref name="genevadeclaration.org"/&gt;

==Use of minors as perpetrators==
Often, minor girls and boys are selected by the family to act as the killers, so that the killer may benefit from the most favorable legal outcome. Boys and sometimes women in the family are often asked to closely control and monitor the behavior of their sisters or other females in the family, to ensure that the females do not do anything to tarnish the 'honor' and 'reputation' of the family. The boys are often asked to carry out the murder, and if they refuse, they may face serious repercussions from the family and community for failing to perform their "duty".&lt;ref name="genevadeclaration.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="humanrights.ch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Honour Related Violence|url=http://www.humanrights.ch/upload/pdf/070419_Kvinnoforum_HRV.pdf|website=Humanrights.ch|publisher=Kvinnoforum|accessdate=20 May 2018|date=2005}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Culture==

===General cultural features===
{{Further|Namus}}
The cultural features which lead to honor killings are complex. Honor killings involve violence and fear as a tool of maintaining control. Honor killings are argued to have their origins among nomadic peoples and herdsmen: such populations carry all their valuables with them and risk having them stolen, and they do not have proper recourse to law. As a result, inspiring fear, using aggression, and cultivating a reputation for violent revenge in order to protect property is preferable to other behaviors. In societies where there is a weak rule of law, people must build fierce reputations.&lt;ref name="justice.gc.ca"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/cj-jp/fv-vf/hk-ch/p3.html |title=Historical Context – Origins of Honour Killing / Honour Killing – Worldwide / Honour Killing – In Countries with Islamic Law – Preliminary Examination of so-called Honour Killings in Canada |publisher=Justice.gc.ca |date= 2013-09-24|accessdate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In many cultures where honor is of central value, men are sources, or active generators/agents of that honor, while the only effect that women can have on honor is to destroy it.&lt;ref name="justice.gc.ca"/&gt; Once the family's or clan's honor is considered to have been destroyed by a woman, there is a need for immediate revenge to restore it, in order for the family to avoid losing face in the community. As [[Amnesty International]] statement notes:
{{quote|The regime of honour is unforgiving: women on whom suspicion has fallen are not given an opportunity to defend themselves, and family members have no socially acceptable alternative but to remove the stain on their honour by attacking the woman.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Broken bodies, shattered minds: Torture and ill-treatment of women|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/001/2001|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=6 March 2001|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080215092414/http://www.amnesty.org/en/library/info/ACT40/001/2001|archivedate=15 February 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

The relation between social views on [[female sexuality]] and honor killings is complex. The way through which women in honor-based societies are considered to bring dishonor to men is often through their sexual behavior. Indeed, violence related to female sexual expression has been documented since Ancient Rome, when the [[pater familias]] had the right to kill an unmarried sexually active daughter or an adulterous wife. In medieval Europe, early Jewish law mandated [[stoning]] for an adulterous wife and her partner.&lt;ref name="justice.gc.ca"/&gt;
[[Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban]], an anthropology professor at [[Rhode Island College]], writes that an act, or even alleged act, of any female sexual misconduct, upsets the moral order of the culture, and bloodshed is the only way to remove any shame brought by the actions and restore social equilibrium.&lt;ref name="Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban"&gt;{{cite web|title=Cultural Relativism and Universal Rights |url=http://www.neiu.edu/~circill/luedke/anth212/cultu.pdf |author=Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban |accessdate=2 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120619113253/http://www.neiu.edu/~circill/luedke/anth212/cultu.pdf |archivedate=19 June 2012 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; However, the relation between honor and female sexuality is a complicated one, and some authors argue that it is not women's sexuality ''per se'' that is the 'problem', but rather women's self-determination in regard to it, as well as [[fertility]]. Sharif Kanaana, professor of [[anthropology]] at [[Birzeit University]], says that honor killing is:
{{quote|A complicated issue that cuts deep into the history of Islamic society. .. What the men of the family, clan, or tribe seek control of in a [[Patrilineality|patrilineal]] society is reproductive power. Women for&lt;!--Should this be "of"?--&gt; the tribe were considered a factory for making men. The honour killing is not a means to control sexual power or behavior. What's behind it is the issue of fertility, or reproductive power.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Commodifying Honor in Female Sexuality: Honor Killings in Palestine|url=http://merip.org/mer/mer206/commodifying-honor-female-sexuality|publisher=[[Middle East Research and Information Project]]|author=Suzanne Ruggi|accessdate=8 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In some cultures, honor killings are considered less serious than other murders simply because they arise from long-standing cultural traditions and are thus deemed appropriate or justifiable.&lt;ref name="Carolyn Fluehr-Lobban"/&gt; Additionally, according to a poll done by the BBC’s Asian network, 1 in 10 of the 500 young south Asians surveyed said they would [[Condonation|condone]] any murder of someone who threatened their family’s honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=One in 10 'backs honor killings'|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/uk_news/5311244.stm|publisher=BBC News|accessdate=8 December 2001}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Nighat Taufeeq of the women's resource center Shirkatgah in [[Lahore]], Pakistan says: "It is an unholy alliance that works against women: the killers take pride in what they have done, the tribal leaders condone the act and protect the killers and the police connive the cover-up."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.amnestyusa.org/violence-against-women/stop-violence-against-women-svaw/honor-killings/page.do?id=1108230 Culture of Discrimination: A Fact Sheet on "Honor" Killings] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110219130620/http://www.amnestyusa.org/violence-against-women/stop-violence-against-women-svaw/honor-killings/page.do?id=1108230 |date=19 February 2011 }}. Amnestyusa.org. Retrieved 1 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; The lawyer and [[human rights activist]] [[Hina Jilani]] says, "The right to life of women in Pakistan is conditional on their obeying social norms and traditions."&lt;ref name="amint"&gt;{{cite web|title=PAKISTAN Honour killings of girls and women|url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa33/018/1999/en/|publisher=Amnesty International|accessdate=15 April 2008 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A July 2008 Turkish study by a team from Dicle University on honor killings in the [[Southeastern Anatolia Region]], the predominantly Kurdish area of Turkey, has so far shown that little if any social stigma is attached to honor killing. It also comments that the practice is not related to a feudal societal structure, "there are also perpetrators who are well-educated university graduates. Of all those surveyed, 60 percent are either high school or university graduates or at the very least, literate."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor killing perpetrators welcomed by society, study reveals|url=http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=147349&amp;bolum=101|publisher=''[[Today's Zaman]]''|author=Murat Gezer|accessdate=15 July 2008 |archiveurl = https://web.archive.org/web/20080719085429/http://www.todayszaman.com/tz-web/detaylar.do?load=detay&amp;link=147349&amp;bolum=101 |archivedate = 19 July 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="utoronto1"&gt;{{cite web|title=Feminist Analysis of Honor Killings in Rural Turkey|url=https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitsream/1807/17543/1/cultureofhonour.pdf|publisher='University of Toronto'|author=AYSAN SEV’ER|accessdate=2 January 2015}}{{dead link|date=September 2017 |bot=InternetArchiveBot |fix-attempted=yes }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In contemporary times, the changing cultural and economic status of women has also been used to explain the occurrences of honor killings. Women in largely patriarchal cultures who have gained economic independence from their families go against their male-dominated culture. Some researchers argue that the shift towards greater responsibility for women and less for their fathers may cause their male family members to act in oppressive and sometimes violent manners in order to regain authority.&lt;ref name="Hilal Onur Ince, Aysun Yarali and Dogancan Ozsel"&gt;{{cite journal|title=Customary Killings in Turkey and Turkish Modernization|author=Hilal Onur Ince, Aysun Yarali and Dogancan Ozsel|doi=10.1080/00263200903009593|volume=45|issue=4|journal=Middle Eastern Studies|pages=537–551|year=2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This change of culture can also be seen to have an effect in Western cultures such as Britain among South Asian and Middle-Eastern communities where honor killings often target women seeking greater independence and adopting seemingly Western values. For families who trace their ancestry back to the Middle East or South Asia, honor killings have targeted women for wearing clothes that are considered Western, having a boyfriend, or refusing to accept an arranged marriage&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor Crimes in Britain Far More Prevalent than Formerly Thought|url=http://www.ibtimes.com/articles/260740/20111203/uk-honor-crimes-killings-iranian-kurdish-indian.htm|publisher=International Business Times|author= Palash R. Ghosh|accessdate=2 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Fareena Alam]], editor of a Muslim magazine, writes that honor killings which arise in Western cultures such as Britain are a tactic for immigrant families to cope with the alienating consequences of urbanization. Alam argues that immigrants remain close to the home culture and their relatives because it provides a safety net. She writes that, {{quote|“In villages "back home", a man's sphere of control was broader, with a large support system. In our cities full of strangers, there is virtually no control over who one's family members sit, talk or work with.”}} Alam argues that it is thus the attempt to regain control and the feelings of alienation that ultimately leads to an honor killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Take the Honor Out of Killing|url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/2004/jul/06/religion.prisonsandprobation|publisher=The Guardian|author= Fareena Alam|accessdate=2 December 2011|location=London|date=6 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Specific triggers of honor killings===

====Refusal of an arranged marriage====
{{main|Forced marriage}}
Refusal of an [[arranged marriage]] is often a cause of an honor killing. The family which has prearranged the marriage risks disgrace if the marriage does not proceed.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.honordiaries.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/06/HD-FactSheet-HonorViolenceEast.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml |title=Ethics: Honour crimes |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://tspace.library.utoronto.ca/bitstream/1807/17543/1/cultureofhonour.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; and the latter is indulged in a relationship with other individual without prior knowledge of the family members.

====Seeking a divorce====
A woman attempting to obtain a divorce or separation without the consent of the husband/extended family can also be a trigger for honor killings. In cultures where marriages are arranged and goods are often exchanged between families, a woman's desire to seek a divorce is often viewed as an insult to the men who negotiated the deal.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling_2.html |title=Thousands of Women Killed for Family "Honor" |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt; By making their marital problems known outside the family, the women are seen as exposing the family to public dishonor.&lt;ref name="hbv-awareness.com"/&gt;

====Allegations and rumors about a family member====
In certain cultures, an ''allegation'' against a woman can be enough to tarnish her family's reputation, and to trigger an honor killing: the family's fear of being ostracized by the community is enormous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml#h1 |title=Ethics: Honour crimes |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Bhaskar Dasgupta | url=http://www.countercurrents.org/gender-dasgupta210204.htm |title=No Honour In Honour Killings |publisher=countercurrents.org |date=21 February 2004 |accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.octevaw-cocvff.ca/sites/all/files/pdf/factsheets/Honour_Killing.pdf |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2013-09-21 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130921061605/http://www.octevaw-cocvff.ca/sites/all/files/pdf/factsheets/Honour_Killing.pdf |archivedate=21 September 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Victims of rape====
{{main|Victim blaming}}
In many cultures, victims of rape face severe violence, including honor killings, from their families and relatives. In many parts of the world, women who have been raped are considered to have brought 'dishonor' or 'disgrace' to their families.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bbc.co.uk/ethics/honourcrimes/crimesofhonour_1.shtml |title=Ethics – Honour crimes |publisher=BBC |date=1 January 1970 |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is especially the case if the victim becomes [[pregnant]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last=Harter |first=Pascale |url=https://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-africa-13760895 |title=BBC News – Libya rape victims 'face honour killings' |publisher=Bbc.co.uk |date=14 June 2011 |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Central to the code of honor, in many societies, is a woman's [[virginity]], which must be preserved until marriage.&lt;ref&gt;http://kuscholarworks.ku.edu/dspace/bitstream/1808/5180/1/STARV24N1-2A4.pdf?origin=publication_detail&lt;/ref&gt; Suzanne Ruggi writes, "A woman's virginity is the property of the men around her, first her father, later a gift for her husband; a virtual dowry as she graduates to marriage."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dafka.org/news/index.php?pid=4&amp;id=358 |title=Dafka |publisher=Dafka |date= |accessdate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Homosexuality====
{{Further|Violence against LGBT people}}
There is evidence that [[homosexuality]] can also be perceived as grounds for honor killing by relatives. It is not only same-sex sexual acts that trigger violence – behaviors that are regarded as inappropriate gender expression (e.g. a male acting or dressing in a "feminine way") can also raise suspicion and lead to honor violence.&lt;ref name="humanrights.ch"/&gt;

In one case, a gay [[Jordan]]ian man was shot and wounded by his brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Gay Jordanian now 'gloriously free' in Canada |author=Marina Jimenez |url=https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v4/sub/MarketingPage?user_URL=https://www.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2FArticleNews%2FTPStory%2FLAC%2F20040520%2FGAY20%2FTPNational%2FTopStories&amp;ord=1145130566379&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;force_login=true |publisher=''[[The Globe and Mail]]'' |accessdate=20 May 2004 |location=Toronto |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070930073849/https://www.theglobeandmail.com/servlet/Page/document/v4/sub/MarketingPage?user_URL=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.theglobeandmail.com%2Fservlet%2FArticleNews%2FTPStory%2FLAC%2F20040520%2FGAY20%2FTPNational%2FTopStories&amp;ord=1145130566379&amp;brand=theglobeandmail&amp;force_login=true |archivedate=30 September 2007 |df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In another case, in 2008, a homosexual [[Turkish people|Turkish]]-Kurdish student, Ahmet Yildiz, was shot outside a cafe and later died in the hospital.

==Causes==
There are multiple causes for which honor killings occur, and numerous factors interact with each other.

===Views on women===
Honor killings are often a result of strongly misogynistic views towards women, and the position of women in society. In these traditionally male-dominated societies women are dependent first on their father and then on their husband, whom they are expected to obey. Women are viewed as property and not as individuals with their own agency. As such, they must submit to male authority figures in the family – failure to do so can result in extreme [[violence]] as punishment.

The owner of the property has the right to decide its fate. The concept of ownership has turned women into a commodity which can be exchanged, bought and sold".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.sanctuaryforfamilies.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=252&amp;Itemid=259 |title=International Domestic Violence Issues |publisher=Sanctuary for Families |date=2008-10-15 |accessdate=2015-02-15 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016194204/http://www.sanctuaryforfamilies.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=252&amp;Itemid=259 |archivedate=16 October 2014 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt; In such cultures, women are not allowed to take control over their bodies and sexuality: these are the property of the males of the family, the father (and other male relatives) who must ensure virginity until marriage; and then the husband to whom his wife's sexuality is subordinated – a woman must not undermine the ownership rights of her guardian by engaging in premarital sex or adultery.&lt;ref name="humanrights.ch"/&gt;

===Cultures of honor and shame===
The concept of [[family honor]] is extremely important in many Muslim communities. The most frequently quoted figure published by the United Nations in 2000 is an estimate of 5,000 killings worldwide each year, most of them in Islamic regions of South Asia, North Africa and the Middle East.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/world/2016/06/09/honor-killings-united-nations-pakistan/85642786/|title='Honor killings': 5 things to know|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The family is viewed as the main source of honor and the community highly values the relationship between honor and the family. Acts by family members which may be considered inappropriate are seen as bringing [[shame]] to the family in the eyes of the community. Such acts often include female behaviors that are related to [[sex outside marriage]] or way of dressing, but may also include male [[homosexuality]] (like the [[emo killings in Iraq]]). The family loses face in the community, and may be shunned by relatives. The only way the shame can be erased is through a killing.&lt;ref name="edz.bib.uni-mannheim.de"/&gt;&lt;ref name="academia.edu"/&gt; The cultures in which honor killings take place are usually considered "[[Collectivism|collectivist cultures]]", where the family is more important than the individual, and individualistic autonomy is seen as a threat to the collective family and its honor.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbv-awareness.com/faq/#twelve |title=FAQ |publisher=Hbv-awareness.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Laws===
Legal frameworks can encourage honor killings. Such laws include on one side leniency towards such killings, and on the other side criminalization of various behaviors, such as extramarital sex, 'indecent' dressing in public places, or homosexual sexual acts, with these laws acting as a way of reassuring perpetrators of honor killings that people engaging in these behaviors deserve punishment.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=W_62ed13ZHUC}} |title=Women of the Jordan: Islam, Labor, and the Law |publisher= |accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=ujwLunL_rrQC}} |title='Honour': Crimes, Paradigms and Violence Against Women |publisher= |accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the [[Roman Empire]] the Roman law ''[[Lex Julia de adulteriis coercendis]]'' implemented by [[Augustus Caesar]] permitted the murder of daughters and their lovers who committed adultery at the hands of their fathers and also permitted the murder of the adulterous wife's lover at the hand of her husband.&lt;ref name="Woolf2007"&gt;{{cite book|author=Greg Woolf|title=Ancient civilizations: the illustrated guide to belief, mythology, and art|url=https://books.google.com/?id=94NuSg3tlsgC&amp;dq=ancient+civilizations+the+illustrated+guide+mythology&amp;q=18BCE+flagrante|year=2007|publisher=Barnes &amp; Noble|isbn=978-1-4351-0121-0|page=386}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Napoleonic Code]] did not allow women to murder unfaithful husbands, while it permitted the murder of unfaithful women by their husbands.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/code/c_code2.html|title=The Civil Code: an Overview|website=www.napoleon-series.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Napoleonic Code Article 324 which was passed in 1810 permitted the murders of an unfaithful wife and her lover at the hand of her husband.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napoleon-series.org/research/government/france/penalcode/c_penalcode3b.html|title=France: Penal Code of 1810|website=www.napoleon-series.org}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was abolished only in 1975. On 7 November 1975, Law no. 617/75 Article 17 repealed the 1810 French Penal Code Article 324. The 1810 penal code Article 324 passed by Napoleon was copied by Middle Eastern Arab countries. It inspired [[Jordan]]'s Article 340 which permits murder of a wife and her lover if caught in the act at the hands of her husband. France's 1810 Penal Code Article 324 also inspired the 1858 Ottoman Penal Code's Article 188, both the French Article 324 and Ottoman article 188 were drawn on to create Jordan's Article 340 which was retained even after a 1944 revision of Jordan's laws which did not touch public conduct and family law so Article 324 still applies to this day.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.centerforinquiry.net/isis/articles_and_books/intrafamily_femicide_in_defence_of_honour_the_case_of_jordan/|title=Secular Islam – Center for Inquiry|website=www.centerforinquiry.net}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://digitalcollections.sit.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1427&amp;context=isp_collection&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.comparativelawreview.com/ojs/index.php/CoLR/article/viewFile/18/22 |title=Archived copy |access-date=7 January 2016 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160304044300/http://www.comparativelawreview.com/ojs/index.php/CoLR/article/viewFile/18/22 |archive-date=4 March 2016 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; France's Mandate over Lebanon resulted in its penal code being imposed there in 1943–1944, with the French inspired Lebanese law for adultery allowing the mere accusation of adultery against women resulting in a maximum punishment of two years in prison while men have to be caught in the act and not merely accused, and are punished with only one year in prison.

** These were amended in 1983, 1994, 1995, 1996 and 1999 and were eventually repealed by the Lebanese Parliament on 4 August 2011
* Libya's Penal Code Article 375

* Oman's Penal Code Article 252
* Palestine, which had two codes

* Yemen's law no. 12/1994 Article 232

==Forced suicide as a substitute==
{{main|Forced suicide}}
A forced suicide may be a substitute for an honor killing. In this case, the family members do not directly kill the victim themselves, but force him or her to commit suicide, in order to avoid punishment. Such suicides are reported to be common in southeastern Turkey.&lt;ref name="unicef.org.tr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5010892.stm |title=UN probes Turkey 'forced suicide' |publisher=BBC News |date=24 May 2006 |accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that in 2001, 565 women lost their lives in honor-related crimes in [[Ilam, Iran]], of which 375 were reportedly staged as [[self-immolation]].&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/mde13/088/2008/en/ Amnesty International (July 2008).

==Restoring honor through a forced marriage==
{{Main|Forced marriage}}
In the case of an unmarried woman or girl associating herself with a man, losing virginity, or being raped, the family may attempt to restore its 'honor' with a 'shotgun wedding'. The groom will usually be the man who has 'dishonored' the woman or girl, but if this is not possible the family may try to arrange a marriage with another man, often a man who is part of the extended family of the one who has committed the acts with the woman or girl. This being an alternative to an honor killing, the woman or girl has no choice but to accept the marriage. The family of the man is expected to cooperate and provide a groom for the woman.&lt;ref name="justice.gc.ca"/&gt;&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unfpa.org/webdav/site/global/shared/documents/publications/2007/honourkillings.pdf |title=United Nations Population Fund &amp;#124; Publications |publisher=UNFPA |date= |accessdate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbv-awareness.com/faq/#twentytwo |title=FAQ |publisher=Hbv-awareness.com |date= |accessdate=2015-02-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Religion==
Widney Brown, the advocacy director of [[Human Rights Watch]], said that the practice "goes across cultures and across religions".&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling.html|title=Thousands of Women Killed for Family "Honor"|website=news.nationalgeographic.com|access-date=2016-07-19}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Resolution 1327 (2003) of the [[Council of Europe]] states that:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://assembly.coe.int/nw/xml/XRef/Xref-XML2HTML-EN.asp?fileid=17106&amp;lang=en|title=Council of Europe Parliamentary Assembly|publisher=|accessdate=10 June 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;
:"The Assembly notes that whilst so-called 'honour crimes' emanate from cultural and not religious roots and are perpetrated worldwide (mainly in patriarchal societies or communities), the majority of reported cases in Europe have been amongst [[Muslim]] or migrant Muslim communities (although [[Islam]] itself does not support the death penalty for honour-related misconduct)."

Many Muslim commentators, and organizations condemn honor killings as an un-Islamic cultural practice.&lt;ref name="Esposito-WENTKAI"&gt;[[John Esposito]] (2011), ''What Everyone Needs to Know About Islam'', p. 177. [[Oxford University Press]]. {{ISBN|978-0-19-979413-3}}.&lt;/ref&gt; Tahira Shaid Khan, a professor of women's issues at [[Aga Khan University]], says that there is nothing in the [[Qur'an]] that permits or sanctions honor killings.&lt;ref name=r1&gt;{{cite news |last=Mayell |first=Hillary |title=Thousands of women killed for family "honor" |url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2002/02/0212_020212_honorkilling_2.html |work=[[National Geographic News]] |publisher=[[National Geographic Society]] |date=12 February 2002}} [http://www.unl.edu/rhames/courses/212/readings/honor-kil-ng.pdf Pdf.]&lt;/ref&gt; Khan instead blames them on attitudes (across different classes, ethnic, and religious groups) that view women as property with no rights of their own as the motivation for honor killings.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; [[Salafi]] scholar [[Muhammad Al-Munajjid]] asserts that the punishment of any crime is only reserved for the Islamic ruler.&lt;ref name=IslamQA101972&gt;{{cite web |url=http://islamqa.info/en/101972 |title=Islam QA Fatwa 101972: Ruling on honour killings |accessdate=2 December 2014 |quote=''Even if we assume that she deserves to be executed (if she was previously-married and committed zina), no one should do that but the ruler – as stated above. Moreover, in many cases killing is done on the basis of accusations and speculation, without proving whether the immoral action even took place.''}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Ali Gomaa]], [[Egypt]]'s ex-[[Grand Mufti]], has also spoken out forcefully against honor killings.&lt;ref name="Esposito-WENTKAI" /&gt;

As a more generic statement reflecting the wider Islamic scholarly trend, [[Jonathan A.C. Brown]] says that "questions about honor killings have regularly found their way into the inboxes of muftis like [[Yusuf Qaradawi]] or the late Lebanese Shiite scholar [[Muhammad Husayn Fadlallah]]. Their responses reflect a rare [[Ijma|consensus]]. No Muslim scholar of any note, either medieval or modern, has sanctioned a man killing his wife or sister for tarnishing her or the family's honor.  If a woman or man found together were to deserve the death penalty for fornication, this would have to be established by the evidence required by the Qur'an: either a confession or the testimony of four male witnesses, all upstanding in the eyes of the court, who actually saw penetration occur."&lt;ref&gt;Jonathan A.C. Brown, ''Misquoting Muhammad: The Challenge and Choices of Interpreting the Prophet's Legacy'', [[Oneworld Publications]] (2014), p. 180&lt;/ref&gt;

==In history==
Matthew A. Goldstein, J.D. (Arizona), has noted that honor killings were encouraged in [[ancient Rome]], where male family members who did not take action against the female adulterers in their families were "actively persecuted".&lt;ref name=MAG29&gt;{{cite web |accessdate=21 July 2012 |url=http://www.politicsandthelifesciences.org/Contents/Contents-2002-9/PLS2002-9-3.pdf |author=Matthew A.

The origin of honor killings and the control of women is evidenced throughout history in the cultures and traditions of many regions. The [[Roman law]] of [[pater familias]] gave complete control to the men of the family over both their children and wives. Under these laws, the lives of children and wives were at the discretion of the men in their families. Ancient Roman Law also justified honor killings by stating that women who were found guilty of adultery could be killed by their husbands. During the [[Qing dynasty]] in [[China]], fathers and husbands had the right to kill daughters who were deemed to have dishonored the family.&lt;ref name="http://hbv-awareness.com/history"&gt;{{Cite web | url=http://hbv-awareness.com/history/ | title=Historical Overview}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Among the [[Amerindian]] [[Aztec]]s and [[Inca]]s, adultery was punishable by death.&lt;ref name=MAG29/&gt; During [[John Calvin]]’s rule of [[Geneva]], women found guilty of adultery were punished by being drowned in the [[Rhone]] river.&lt;ref name="http://hbv-awareness.com/history"/&gt;

==By region==

According to the UN in 2002:

{{quote|text=The report of the [[United Nations special rapporteur|Special Rapporteur]]... concerning cultural practices in the family that are violent towards women (E/CN.4/2002/83), indicated that honour killings had been reported in [[Egypt]], [[Jordan]], [[Lebanon]] (the Lebanese Parliament abolished the Honor killing in August 2011), [[Morocco]], [[Pakistan]], the [[Syria|Syrian Arab Republic]], [[Turkey]], [[Yemen]], and other [[Mediterranean]] and [[Persian Gulf]] countries, and that they had also taken place in western countries such as [[France]], [[Germany]] and the [[United Kingdom]], within migrant communities.&lt;ref name="unhchr"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Abu-Ghanem women speak out against serial 'honor killings'|url=http://www.haaretz.com/hasen/spages/829440.html|publisher=''[[Haaretz]]''|accessdate=23 February 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In addition, the United Nations Commission on Human Rights gathered reports from several countries and considering only the countries that submitted reports it was shown that honor killings have occurred in [[Bangladesh]], [[Great Britain]], [[Brazil]], [[Ecuador]], [[Egypt]], [[India]], [[Israel]], [[Italy]], [[Jordan]], [[Pakistan]], [[Morocco]], [[Sweden]], [[Turkey]], and [[Uganda]].&lt;ref name="Sanctuary For Families"&gt;{{cite web|title=International Domestic Violence Issues |url=http://www.sanctuaryforfamilies.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=252&amp;Itemid=259 |publisher=Sanctuary For Families |accessdate=5 December 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016194204/http://www.sanctuaryforfamilies.org/index.php?option=com_content&amp;task=view&amp;id=252&amp;Itemid=259 |archivedate=16 October 2014 |df=dmy}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The issue of honor killings has risen to prominence in Europe in recent years, prompting the need to address the occurrence of honor killings. The 2009 European Parliamentary Assembly noted this in their Resolution 1681 which noted the dire need to address honor crimes. The resolution stated that: {{quote|"On so-called 'honour crimes,' the Parliamentary Assembly notes that the problem, far from diminishing, has worsened, including in Europe. It mainly affects women, who are its most frequent victims, both in Europe and the rest of the world, especially in patriarchal and fundamentalist communities and societies.

She was of Pakistani origin. Her murder was ordered by her father to save her family's 'honor' and several relatives were involved. Sentences considered harsh by Danish standards were handed out to all nine accused members of her family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url= http://www.dr.dk/Nyheder/Indland/kriminalitet/2006/06/27/174655.htm |title= Dom vil sende chokbølger i indvandrermiljøet |website= [[dr.dk]] |date= 2006-06-27 |accessdate= 2017-01-16 |language= da |trans-title= Sentence to send shock‐waves through immigrant communities}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====France====
[[France]] has a large immigrant community from [[North Africa]] (especially from [[Algeria]], [[Morocco]] and [[Tunisia]]) and honor based violence occurs in this community.&lt;ref name=autogenerated7&gt;Geesy, Patricia "North African Immigrants in France: Integration and Change" 1995 Substance 77(76) p137.&lt;/ref&gt; A 2009 report by the [[Council of Europe]] cited the United Kingdom, Germany, Belgium, France, and Norway as countries where honor crimes and honor killings occur.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-2009-05-21-voa39-68815262/363828.html|title=Number of Honor Killings in Europe Higher Than Thought|work=VOA|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

France traditionally provided for leniency with regard to honor crimes, particularly when they were committed against women who had committed adultery.
The [[Napoleonic Code]] of 1804, established under [[Napoleon Bonaparte]], is one of the origins of the legal leniency with regard to adultery-related killings in a variety of legal systems in several countries around the world. Under this code, a man who killed his wife after she had been caught in the act of adultery could not be charged with premeditated murder – although he could be charged with other lesser offenses. This defense was available only for a husband, not for a wife. The Napoleonic Code has been very influential, and many countries, inspired by it, provided for lesser penalties or even acquittal for such crimes. This can be seen in the criminal codes of many [[French colonial empire|former French colonies]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://hbv-awareness.com/regions/ |title=Honour Killings By Region |publisher=Hbv-awareness.com |date=18 March 2012 |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|url={{Google books |plainurl=yes |id=iuAzDHsAHT0C}} |title=Lethal Imagination: Violence and Brutality in American History |publisher= |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Germany====
Investigating criminal records for partner homicides from the years 1996-2005 period, the [[Federal Criminal Police Office (Germany)|German Federal Criminal Police Office]] concluded that there were about 12 cases of honour killings in Germany per year, including cases involving collective [[family honor]] and individual male honor, out of an average about 700 annual homicides. An accompanied study of all homicides in Baden-Württemberg show that men from Turkey, Yugoslavia and Albania have a between three and five times overrepresentation for partner homicides, both honor and non-honor releated. The causes for the higher rate was given as low education and social status of these groups along with cultural traditions of [[violence against women]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Ehrenmorde in Deutschland 1996-2005 eine Untersuchung auf der Basis von Prozessakten|last=1963-|first=Oberwittler, Dietrich|date=2011|publisher=Luchterhand|others=Kasselt, Julia 1980-, Bundeskriminalamt|isbn=9783472080459|location=Köln|page=172–173|oclc=765999746}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005 ''[[Der Spiegel]]'' reported: "In the past four months, six Muslim women living in [[Berlin]] have been killed by family members". The article went on to cover the case of [[Hatun Sürücü]], a Turkish-Kurdish woman who was killed by her brother for not staying with the husband she was forced to marry, and for "living like a [[German people|German]]". Precise statistics on how many women die every year in such honor killings are hard to come by, as many crimes are never reported, said Myria Boehmecke of the [[Tuebingen]]-based women's group ''[[Terre des Femmes]]''. The group tries to protect Muslim girls and women from oppressive families. The Turkish women's organization ''Papatya'' has documented 40 instances of honor killings in Germany since 1996.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.spiegel.de/international/0,1518,344374,00.html|title=The Whore Lived Like a German|publisher=Der Spiegel, Germany|newspaper=Spiegel Online|date=2005-03-02|last1=Biehl|first1=Jody K.}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.sfgate.com/cgi-bin/article.cgi?f=/c/a/2005/12/04/MNGH0G1B7L1.DTL&amp;type=printable|title=Muslim girls in Austria fighting forced marriages – Program for women helps them escape from family pressures, unwanted weddings – and violence|publisher=San Francisco Chronicle | first=Eric | last=Geiger | date=4 December 2005}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hatun Sürücü's brother was convicted of murder and jailed for nine years and three months by a German court in 2006.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.expatica.com/de/articles/news/turkish-man-in-berlin-jailed-for-honour-killing-of-sister-29300.html|title=Turkish man in Berlin jailed for 'honour killing' of sister|publisher=www.expatica.com}} here&lt;/ref&gt; In March 2009, a Kurdish immigrant from Turkey, Gülsüm S., was killed for a relationship not in keeping with her religious family's plan for an arranged marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.bild.de/BILD/news/2009/03/11/ehrenmord/erschlagen-weil-sie-schwanger-war.html|publisher=Der Bild|title=Erschlagen, weil sie schwanger war? – Killed, because she was pregnant?}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016 a Kurdish Yazidi woman was shot dead at her wedding in Hannover for allegedly refusing to marry her cousin in a forced marriage.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Kurdish woman shot dead at wedding for refusing to marry her cousin |url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/women/life/kurdish-woman-shot-dead-at-wedding-for-refusing-to-marry-her-cou/|date=11 March 2016|publisher=[[The Daily Telegraph]]}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Italy====
Similar to other Southern/Mediterranean European areas, honor was traditionally important in [[Italy]]. Indeed, until 1981, the Criminal Code provided for mitigating circumstances for such killings; until 1981 the law read: ''Art. 587: He who causes the death of a spouse, daughter, or sister upon discovering her in illegitimate carnal relations and in the heat of passion caused by the '''offence to his honour or that of his family''' will be sentenced to three to seven years. The same sentence shall apply to whom, in the above circumstances, causes the death of the person involved in illegitimate carnal relations with his spouse, daughter, or sister''.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.surt.org/gvei/docs/national_report_italy.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.diritto24.ilsole24ore.com/guidaAlDiritto/codici/codicePenale/articolo/716/art-587-omicidio-e-lesione-personale-a-causa-di-onore.html|title=Omicidio e lesione personale a causa di onore|work=Diritto24|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Traditionally, honor crimes used to be more prevalent in [[Southern Italy]].&lt;ref name="rferl.org"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.lalibellulaitalianistica.it/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/HonorKillingEditAnnaCafaro.pdf |title=Revista de italianistica - Revista italia |accessdate=2014-10-11 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20141016140801/http://www.lalibellulaitalianistica.it/blog/wp-content/uploads/2012/11/HonorKillingEditAnnaCafaro.pdf |archivedate=16 October 2014 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Main|Honor killing of Anooshe Sediq Ghulam}}
[[Anooshe Sediq Ghulam]] was a 22-year-old Afghan refugee in Norway, who was killed by her husband in an honor killing in 2002. She had reported her husband to the police for [[domestic violence]] and was seeking a [[divorce]].

====Sweden====
The [[Swedish National Police Board]] and the [[Swedish Prosecution Authority]] define honor related crime as crimes against a relative who, according to the perpetrator and his family's point of view, has disohonoured the family. These crimes are intended to prevent the family honor being damaged or to restore damaged or lost family honor.&lt;ref name=":4"&gt;{{Cite book|title=Våld i nära relationer - en folkhälsofråga : förslag för ett effektivare arbete : betänkande|last=relationer.|first=Sverige.

The most serious honor related crime is often organised and deliberate and not limited to killing. Incidents include torture, forced suicides, forced marriages, rapes, kidnapping, assault, mortal threats, extortion and protecting a criminal.&lt;ref name=":4" /&gt;

In 2008 a man had to flee from [[Turkey]] after his Kurdish boyfriend was killed by his own father.&lt;ref name="nytimes.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="taz.de"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.pinknews.co.uk/news/articles/2005-13994.html/ | work= Pink News | title= Turkish man tried in absentia for ‘honour killing’ of gay son | date = 9 September 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url= http://www.pinknews.co.uk/2011/12/08/partner-of-turkish-gay-man-shot-in-honour-killing-to-address-london-audience-tomorrow/ | work= Pink News | title= Partner of Turkish gay man shot in ‘honour killing’ to address London audience tomorrow | date = 8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Middle East===

====Egypt====
Honor killings in [[Egypt]] occur due to reasons such as a woman meeting an unrelated man, even if this is only an allegation; or adultery (real or suspected). The exact number of honor killings is not known, but a report in 1995 estimated about 52 honor
killings that year.&lt;ref&gt;https://www.un.org/womenwatch/daw/egm/vaw-gp-2005/docs/experts/khafagy.honorcrimes.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; In 2013, a woman and her two daughters were murdered by 10 male relatives, who strangled and beat them, and then threw their bodies in the [[Nile]]. Honor killings are illegal in Egypt and five of the ten men were arrested.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.inquisitr.com/674939/three-egyptian-women-killed-in-honor-killing-five-men-arrested/|title=Three Egyptian Women Killed In 'Honor Killing,' Five Men Arrested|work=The Inquisitr News|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.msn.com/world/egyptian-mom-daughters-killed-in-suspected-honor-crime|title=News|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Iran====
In [[Iran]], honor killings occur primarily among tribal minority groups, such as Kurdish, Arab, Lori, Baluchi, and Turkish-speaking tribes, while honor-related crimes are not a tradition among Persians who are generally less socially conservative. Honor killings are particularly prevalent in the provinces of Kordistan and Ilam. Discriminatory [[family law]]s, articles in the Criminal Code that show leniency towards honor killings, and a strongly male dominated society have been cited as causes of honor killings in Iran.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.landinfo.no/asset/960/1/960_1.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; It was reported that in 2001, 565 women lost their lives in honor-related crimes in [[Ilam, Iran]], of which 375 were reportedly staged as [[self-immolation]].&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt; In 2008, self-immolation, "occurred in all the areas of Kurdish settlement (in Iran), where it was more common than in other parts of Iran".&lt;ref name="amnesty.org"/&gt;

====Iraq====
In 2008, the United Nations Assistance Mission for Iraq (UNAMI) has stated that honor killings are a serious concern in Iraq, particularly well documented in Iraqi Kurdistan.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.hrw.org/report/2011/02/21/crossroads/human-rights-iraq-eight-years-after-us-led-invasion|title=At a Crossroads|date=21 February 2011|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Free Women's Organization of Kurdistan (FWOK) released a statement on International Women's Day 2015 noting that "6,082 women were killed or forced to commit suicide during the past year in Iraqi Kurdistan, which is almost equal to the number of the Peshmerga martyred fighting Islamic State (IS)," and that a large number of women were victims of honor killings or enforced suicide&amp;mdash;mostly [[self-immolation]] or hanging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://basnews.com/en/news/2015/03/05/over-6000-women-killed-during-the-last-year-in-kurdistan/ |publisher=BasNews |title=Kurdistan: Over 6,000 Women Killed in 2014 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150402140715/http://basnews.com/en/news/2015/03/05/over-6000-women-killed-during-the-last-year-in-kurdistan/ |archivedate=2 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; About 500 honor killings per year are reported in hospitals in Iraqi Kurdistan, although real numbers are likely much higher.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2007/393248/IPOL-FEMM_ET(2007)393248_EN.pdf Kurdish Human Rights Project European Parliament Project: The Increase in Kurdish Women Committing Suicide Final Report Vian Ahmed Khidir Pasha, Member of Kurdistan National Assembly, Member of Women’s Committee, Erbil, Iraq, 25 January 2007]&lt;/ref&gt; It is speculated that alone in Erbil there is one honor killing per day.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/etudes/join/2007/393248/IPOL-FEMM_ET(2007)393248_EN.pdf Kurdish Human Rights Project European Parliament Project: The Increase in Kurdish Women Committing Suicide Final Report Reported by several NGOs and members of Kurdistan National Assembly over course of study to Project Team Member Tanyel B.

As many as 133 women were killed in the Iraqi city of [[Basra]] alone in 2006. 79 were killed for violation of "Islamic teachings" and 47 for honor, according to IRIN, the news branch of the U.N.'s Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. Amnesty International says that armed groups, not the government, also kill politically active women and those who did not follow a strict dress code, as well as women who are perceived as human rights defenders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Violations of 'Islamic teachings' take deadly toll on Iraqi women|author=[[Arwa Damon]]|url=http://www.cnn.com/2008/WORLD/meast/02/08/iraq.women/index.html?eref=ib_topstories|publisher=''[[CNN]]''|accessdate=8 February 2008 | date=8 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt; 17-year-old [[Du'a Khalil Aswad]], an [[Iraq]]i girl of the [[Yazidis|Yazidi]] faith, was stoned to death in front of a mob of about 2000 men in 2007,&lt;ref name="dailymail20070503"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.dailymail.co.uk/pages/live/articles/news/worldnews.html?in_article_id=452288&amp;in_page_id=1811|title=The moment a teenage girl was stoned to death for loving the wrong boy|accessdate=21 May 2007|date=3 May 2007|work=World news|publisher=[[Daily Mail]]|location=London}}&lt;/ref&gt; possibly because she was allegedly planning to convert to Islam.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |title=Iraq: Amnesty International appalled by stoning to death of Yezidi girl and subsequent killings |url=https://www.amnesty.org/download/Documents/68000/mde140272007en.pdf |publisher=[[Amnesty International]]  |date=27 April 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt; A video of the brutal incident was released on the Internet.

====Jordan====
[[Sharaf (Bedouin)|Sharaf]] is the honor of the family, tribe or person which can increase if the path of moral behavior is followed or decrease if it is left. [['ird]] is that honor which relates only to the women in family; it can only decrease. Sharaf is outweighed by 'ird.&lt;ref name=YotamFeldner&gt;[http://www.meforum.org/50/honor-murders-why-the-perps-get-off-easy "'Honor' Murders: Why the Perps Get off Easy"] by Yotam Feldner for Middle East Quarterly, Dec 2000. Retrieved 2012-01-10.&lt;/ref&gt;

To regain sharaf, 'ird must be cleansed.
{{quote|Tarrad Fayiz, a Jordanian tribal leader, explains: "A woman is like an olive tree. When its branch catches woodworm, it has to be chopped off so that society stays clean and pure."&lt;ref name="YotamFeldner"/&gt;}}

[[Murder]], marriage to the person who violated the woman's honor, or marriage to another man will all restore 'ird.

There are still honor killings in Jordan.
A 2008 report of the National Council of Family Affairs in Jordan, an [[non-governmental organization|NGO]] affiliated with the Queen of Jordan, indicated that the National Forensic Medicine Center recorded 120 murdered women in 2006, with 18 cases classified officially as crimes of honor.&lt;ref name="status_of_violence_2008_ncfa_jordan"&gt;[http://www.ncfa.org.jo/Portals/0/VAW%20EN.pdf "Status of Violence against Women in Jordan"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20141129024843/http://www.ncfa.org.jo/Portals/0/VAW%20EN.pdf |date=29 November 2014 }}, National Council for Family Affairs, 2008, Amman, Jordan&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2013, the [[BBC]] cited estimates by the National Council of Family Affairs in Jordan, an NGO, that as many as 50 Jordanian women and girls had been killed in the preceding 13 years. But the BBC indicated "the real figure" was probably "far higher," because "most honour killings go unreported."&lt;ref name="many_jordan_teens_2013_06_20_bbc"&gt;Maher, Ahmed, ["Many Jordan teenagers 'support honour killings'"], 20 June 2013, BBC News&lt;/ref&gt;

Men used to receive reduced sentences for killing their wives or female family members if they are deemed to have brought dishonor to their family. Families often get sons under the age of 16—legally [[minor (law)|minors]]—to commit honor killings; the juvenile law allows convicted minors to serve time in a juvenile detention center and be released with a clean criminal record at the age of 16. Rana Husseini, a leading journalist on the topic of honor killings, states that "under the existing law, people found guilty of committing honor killings often receive sentences as light as six months in prison".&lt;ref name="alertnet.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.alertnet.org/thenews/newsdesk/IRIN/6f6d5166f24330a0e8edcb79796ca5cc.htm |title= Jordan: Special Report on Honour Killings |accessdate= 8 February 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to UNICEF, there are an average of 23 honor killings per year in Jordan.&lt;ref name=unicef /&gt;

On 1 August 2017, article 98 in the penal codes were amended to exclude receiving lenient punishments for being in "a state of great fury". However, article 340 which sees reduced penalties when a man attacks or kills a female relative having found her in the act of "adultery", is still in effect.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.albawaba.com/loop/historic-day-jordanian-women-celebrations-marriage-loophole-rapists-removed-1004698|title='Historic Day for Jordanian Women': Joy as Marriage Loophole for Rapists Removed|work=Al Bawaba|accessdate=5 August 2017|date=2 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A 2013 survey of "856 ninth graders – average age of 15 – from a range of secondary schools across Amman – including private and state, mixed-sex and single gender" showed that attitudes favoring honor killings are present in the "next generation" Jordanians: "In total, 33.4% of all respondents either "agreed" or "strongly agreed" with situations depicting honour killings. Boys were more than twice as likely to support honour killings: 46.1% of boys and 22.1% of girls agreed with at least two honour killing situations in the questionnaire." The parents' education was found to be a significant correlation: "61% of teenagers from the lowest level of educational background showed supportive attitudes towards honour killing, as opposed to only 21.1% where at least one family member has a university degree."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/belief-that-honour-killings-are-justified-still-prevalent-among-jordans-next-generation-study-shows |title=Belief that honour killings are 'justified' still prevalent among Jordan's next generation, study shows &amp;#124; University of Cambridge |publisher=Cam.ac.uk |date=20 June 2013 |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1002/ab.21485 | pmid=23744567 | volume=39 | issue=5 | title=Honor Killing Attitudes Amongst Adolescents in Amman, Jordan | journal=Aggressive Behavior | pages=405–417| year=2013 | last1=Eisner | first1=Manuel | last2=Ghuneim | first2=Lana }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Kuwait====
[[Kuwait]] is relatively liberal (by Middle East standards), and honor killings are rare, but not unheard of – in 2006 a young woman died in an honor killing committed by her brothers. In 2008, a girl was given police protection after reporting that her family intended to kill her for having an affair with a man.

====Lebanon====
There are no exact official numbers about honor killings of women in [[Lebanon]]; many honor killings are arranged to look like accidents, but the figure is believed to be 40 to 50 per year. A 2007 report by Amnesty International said that the Lebanese media in 2001 reported 2 or 3 honor killings per month in Lebanon, although the number is believed to be higher by other independent sources.

On 4 August 2011, however, the [[Lebanese Parliament]] agreed by a majority to abolish Article 562, which for the past years had worked as an excuse to commute the sentence given for honor killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.globalroomforwomen.com/global-heart-blog/entry/lebanon-at-last-removes-honor-crime-article-from-its-penal-code-.html|title=Lebanon at last removes honor crime article from its penal code |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20130124045211/http://www.globalroomforwomen.com/global-heart-blog/entry/lebanon-at-last-removes-honor-crime-article-from-its-penal-code-.html |archivedate=24 January 2013 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www2.amnesty.se/krg.nsf/Webbdokument/0239DFFA7B4CACEFC1256CB700473F8D?opendocument|title=Hedersmord|publisher=''[[Amnesty]]'' |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://archive.is/20051215060833/http://www2.amnesty.se/krg.nsf/Webbdokument/0239DFFA7B4CACEFC1256CB700473F8D?opendocument |archivedate=15 December 2005 |accessdate=11 April 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2005, 22-year-old Faten Habash, a Christian from [[West Bank]], was said to have dishonored her family by falling for a young Muslim man, Samer. Following their thwarted attempts to elope to Jordan, she suffered her relatives' wrath after rejecting the options of either marrying her cousin or becoming a nun in Rome. She had spent a period of time in hospital recovering from a broken pelvis and various other injuries caused by an earlier beating by her father and other family members. Still fearing her family after her release from hospital, she approached a powerful [[Bedouin]] tribe, which took her under its care. Her father then wept and gave his word that he would not harm her. She returned to him, only to be bludgeoned to death with an iron bar days later.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/programmes/from_our_own_correspondent/4522465.stm | work=BBC News | title=Killed for the family's honour | date=7 May 2005 | first=Orla | last=Guerin}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Saudi Arabia====
In 2008 a woman was killed in [[Saudi Arabia]] by her father for "chatting" with a man on [[Facebook]]. The killing became public only when a Saudi cleric referred to the case, to criticize Facebook for the strife it caused.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/worldnews/1583420/Saudi-woman-killed-for-chatting-on-Facebook.html|author=Damien McElroy|title=Saudi woman killed for chatting on Facebook|publisher=''[[The Daily Telegraph]]''|accessdate=27 September 2008 | location=London | date=31 March 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Syrian Civil War]] has been reported as leading to an increase in honor killings in the country, mainly due to the common occurrence of [[war rape]], which led to the stigmatization of victims by their relatives and communities, and in turn to honor killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.trust.org/item/20131204182854-8hegf/|title=Syrian war causing 'honour killings', child marriages – doctor|author=Thomson Reuters Foundation|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A report compiled by the Council of Europe estimated that over 200 women were killed in honor killings in Turkey in 2007.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.voanews.com/content/a-13-2009-05-21-voa39-68815262/363828.html |title=Number of Honor Killings in Europe Higher Than Thought |publisher=voanews.com |accessdate=23 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; A June 2008 report by the Turkish Prime Ministry's Human Rights Directorate said that in [[Istanbul]] alone there was one honor killing every week, and reported over 1,000 during the previous five years.

A report by [[UNFPA]] identified the following situations as being common triggers for honor killings: a married woman having an extra-marital relationship; a married woman running away with a man; a married woman getting separated or divorced; a divorced woman having a relationship with another man; a young unmarried girl having a relationship; a young unmarried girl running away with a man; a woman (married or unmarried) being kidnapped and/or raped.&lt;ref name="unfpa.org"/&gt;

In Turkey, young boys are often ordered by other family members to commit the honor killing, so that they can get a shorter jail sentence (because they are minors).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5285726.stm | work=BBC News | title=Turkish boys commit 'honour' crimes | date=28 August 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; Forced suicides – where the victim who is deemed to have 'dishonored' the family is ordered to commit suicide in an attempt by the perpetrator to avoid legal consequences – also take place in Turkey, especially in [[Batman, Turkey|Batman]] in southeastern Turkey, which has been nicknamed "Suicide City".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/europe/5010892.stm | work=BBC News | title=UN probes Turkey 'forced suicide' | date=24 May 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/world/europe/women-told-you-have-dishonoured-your-family-please-kill-yourself-1655373.html | location=London | work=The Independent | first=Ramita | last=Navai | title=Women told: 'You have dishonoured your family, please kill yourself' | date=27 March 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/16/world/europe/16turkey.html?pagewanted=all&amp;_r=0 | work=The New York Times | first=Dan | last=Bilefsky | title=How to Avoid Honor Killing in Turkey?

In 2009 a Turkish news agency reported that a 2-day-old boy who was born out of wedlock had been killed for honor in Istanbul.

Throughout the 20th century, husbands have used the "legitimate defense of their honor" (''legítima defesa da honra'') as justification for adultery-related killings in court cases. Although this defense was not explicitly stipulated in the 20th century Criminal Code, it has been successfully pleaded by lawyers throughout the 20th century, in particular in the interior of the country, though less so in the coastal big cities. In 1991 [[Supreme Federal Court|Brazil's Supreme Court]] explicitly rejected the "honor defense" as having no basis in [[Law of Brazil|Brazilian law]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |first=James |last=Brooke |date=29 March 1991 |title='Honor' Killing of Wives Is Outlawed in Brazil |url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/03/29/us/honor-killing-of-wives-is-outlawed-in-brazil.html |work=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/738-decriminalization-of-adultery-and-defenses.html|title=Decriminalization of adultery and defenses|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.law-lib.utoronto.ca/Diana/fulltext/nels.htm |title=Archived copy |accessdate=2015-03-02 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150601004331/http://www.law-lib.utoronto.ca/Diana/fulltext/nels.htm |archivedate=1 June 2015 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Canada====
A 2007 study by Dr. Amin Muhammad and Dr. Sujay Patel of [[Memorial University]], [[Canada]], investigated how the practice of honor killings has been brought to Canada. The report explained that "When people come and settle in Canada they can bring their traditions and forcefully follow them. In some cultures, people feel that some boundaries are never to be crossed, and if someone would violate those practices or go against them, then killing is justified to them." The report noted that "In different cultures, they can get away without being punished—the courts actually sanction them under religious contexts". The report also said that the people who commit these crimes are usually mentally ill, and that the mental health aspect is often ignored by Western observers because of a lack of understanding of the insufficiently developed state of mental healthcare in developing countries in which honor killings are prevalent.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Jamie Baker|url=http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/story.html?id=d05e437f-4661-4965-9455-ff30c6b9d4a5&amp;k=20265|title=Cultural 'honour' killing brought to Canada|publisher=''[[The Telegram]]''|accessdate=27 September 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090126082224/http://www.canada.com/vancouversun/story.html?id=d05e437f-4661-4965-9455-ff30c6b9d4a5&amp;k=20265|archivedate=26 January 2009|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Honor killings have become such a pressing issue in Canada that the Canadian citizenship study guide mentions it specifically, saying, "Canada's openness and generosity do not extend to barbaric cultural practices that tolerate spousal abuse, 'honour killings', [[female genital mutilation]], [[forced marriage]] or other gender-based violence."&lt;ref name=alleged /&gt;

====United States====

{{Main|Honor killing in the United States}}
[[Phyllis Chesler]] argues that the U.S., as well as Canada, do not have proper measures in place to fight against honor killings, and they do not recognize these murders as a specific form of violence, distinct from other domestic murders, due to fear of being labeled "[[political correctness|culturally insensitive]]". According to her, this often prevents government officials in the United States and the media from identifying and accurately reporting these incidents as "honor killings" when they occur. Failing to accurately describe the problem makes it more difficult to develop public policies to address it, she argues.&lt;ref name="chesler"&gt;Phyllis Chesler, [http://www.meforum.org/article/2067 Are Honor Killings Simply Domestic Violence?], ''Middle East Quarterly,'' Spring 2009, pp. 61–69; Meforum.org. Retrieved 1 October 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

She also writes that, although there are not many cases of honor killing within the United States, the overwhelming majority of honor killings are perpetrated by Muslims against Muslims (90% of honor killings known to have taken place in Europe and the United States from 1998 to 2008).&lt;ref name="chesler"/&gt; In these documented cases the victims were murdered because they were believed to have acted in a way that was against the religion of the family. In every case, the perpetrators view their victims as having violated rules of religious conduct and they act without remorse.&lt;ref name="chesler"/&gt;

Several honor killings have occurred in the U.S. during recent years. In 1989, in [[St. Louis|St. Louis, Missouri]], 16-year-old Palestinan "Tina" Isa was murdered by her Palestinian father with the aid of his wife. Her parents were dissatisfied with her "westernized" lifestyle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.nytimes.com/1991/10/28/us/terror-and-death-at-home-are-caught-in-fbi-tape.html | work=The New York Times | title=Terror and Death at Home Are Caught in F.B.I.

[[Aasiya Zubair]] was, together with her husband [[Muzzammil Hassan]], the founder and owner of Bridges TV, the first American Muslim English-language television network. She was killed by her husband in 2009. Phyllis Chesler argues that this crime was an honor killing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.foxnews.com/opinion/2010/07/12/phyllis-chesler-muslim-honor-killings-media/ | work=Fox News | title=Are Some Honor Killings More Equal Than Others? | date=12 July 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2009, in [[Arizona]], Noor Almaleki, aged 20, was killed by her father, an Iraqi immigrant, because she had refused an arranged marriage and was living with her boyfriend.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=https://www.reuters.com/article/2011/02/22/us-arizona-iraqi-idUSTRE71L8IT20110222 | work=Reuters | title=Iraqi guilty of murder in daughter's "honor killing" | date=22 February 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The extent of honor-based violence in the U.S. is not known, because no official data is collected. There is controversy about the reasons why such violence occurs, and about the extent to which culture, religion, and views on women cause these incidents.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title="Honor killing" under growing scrutiny in the U.S.|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/news/honor-killing-under-growing-scrutiny-in-the-us/# | work=[[CBS News]] |date=5 April 2012|first=Julia|last=Dahl}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Latin America====
[[Crimes of passion]] within Latin America have also been compared to honor killings.&lt;ref name=r1/&gt; Similar to honor killings, crimes of passion often feature the murder of a woman by a husband, family member, or boyfriend and the crime is often condoned or sanctioned. In [[Peru]], for example, 70 percent of the murders of women in one year were committed by a husband, boyfriend or lover, and most often jealousy or suspicions of infidelity are cited as the reasons for the murders.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wluml.org/node/4628 |title=Peru Hundreds of Women Murdered in the Name of 'Honour' and 'Passion' |website=www.wluml.org|accessdate=27 October 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The law of [[Uruguay]] continues to tolerate crimes of passion due to adultery. However, "while crimes of passion may be seen as somewhat premeditated to a certain extent, honour killings are usually deliberate, well planned and premeditated acts when a person kills a female relative ostensibly to uphold his honour."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.justice.gc.ca/eng/rp-pr/cj-jp/fv-vf/hk-ch/p3.html|title=Preliminary Examination of so-called "Honour Killings" in Canada|first=Government of Canada, Department of Justice, Electronic|last=Communications|website=www.justice.gc.ca|date=2013-09-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The view that violence can be justified in the name of honor and shame exists traditionally in Latin American societies, and [[machismo]] is often described as a code of honor. While some ideas originated in the Spanish colonial culture, others predate it: in the early history of Peru, the laws of the [[Inca Empire|Incas]] allowed husbands to starve their wives to death if they committed adultery, while [[Aztec]] laws in early [[Mexico]] stipulated stoning or strangulation as punishment for female adultery.&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Until a few decades ago, the marriage of a girl or woman to the man who had raped her was considered a "solution" to the incident in order to restore her family's 'honor'. Indeed, although laws that exonerate the perpetrator of rape if he marries his victim after the rape are often associated with the Middle East, such laws were very common around the world until the second half of the 20th century, and as late as 1997, 14 [[Latin American]] countries had such laws,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.nytimes.com/1997/03/12/world/justice-in-peru-victim-gets-rapist-for-a-husband.html|title=Justice in Peru: Victim Gets Rapist for a Husband|first=Calvin|last=Sims|date=12 March 1997|publisher=|newspaper=The New York Times}}&lt;/ref&gt; although most of these Latin American countries have since abolished them.

[[Jim Spigelman]] (who served as Chief Justice of the Supreme Court of New South Wales from 19 May 1998 until 31 May 2011) said that Australia's increasing diversity was creating conflicts about how to deal with the customs and traditions of immigrant populations. He said:"There are important racial, ethnic and religious minorities in Australia who come from nations with sexist traditions which, in some respects, are even more pervasive than those of the West." He said that honor crimes, forced marriages and other violent acts against women were becoming a problem in Australia.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.watoday.com.au/national/honour-killings-coming-to-our-courts-top-judge-20100416-shx0.html|title=Honour killings coming to our courts: top judge|work=WA Today|accessdate=20 April 2015|date=2010-04-15}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2010, in [[New South Wales]], Indonesian born Hazairin Iskandar and his son killed the lover of Iskandar's wife. Iskandar stabbed the victim with a knife while his son bashed him with a hammer. The court was told that the reason for the murder was the perpetrators' belief that extramarital affairs were against their religion; and that the murder was carried out to protect the honor of the family and was a "pre-planned, premeditated and executed killing". The judge said that: "No society or culture that regards itself as civilized can tolerate to any extent, or make any allowance for, the killing of another person for such an amorphous concept as honour".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.smh.com.au/nsw/honour-killing-abhorrent-says-judge-as-man-convicted-and-son-starts-18year-term-20120627-212w5.html | work=The Sydney Morning Herald | title='Honour' killing abhorrent, says judge, as man convicted and son starts 18-year term}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://www.adelaidenow.com.au/news/national/sydney-man-guilty-of-honour-killing/story-e6frea7l-1226410139724&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.abc.net.au/news/2012-06-27/murder-verdict-for-honour-killing-of-wife27s-lover/4095958|title=Murder verdict over honour killing of wife's lover|work=ABC News|accessdate=20 April 2015|date=2012-06-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Pela Atroshi was a Kurdish 19-year-old girl who was killed by her uncle in [[Iraqi Kurdistan]] in 1999. The decision to kill her was taken by a council of her male relatives, led by Pela's grandfather, Abdulmajid Atroshi, who lived in Australia. One of his sons, Shivan Atroshi, who helped with the murder, also lived in Australia. Pela Atroshi was living in [[Sweden]], but was taken by family members to Iraqi Kurdistan to be killed, as ordered by a family council of male relatives living in Sweden and Australia, because they claimed she had tarnished the family honor. Pela Atroshi's murder was officially deemed an honor killing by authorities.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news| url=http://www.news.com.au/national/australian-links-to-brutal-honour-killing/story-e6frfkp9-1111116166086 | work=The Australian | title=Australian links in honour killing of Pela Atroshi | date=26 April 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==International response==
Honor killings are condemned as a serious human rights violation and are addressed by several international instruments. The [[Council of Europe Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence]] addresses this issue. Article 42 reads:&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.conventions.coe.int/Treaty/EN/Treaties/Html/210.htm|title=Council of Europe – Convention on preventing and combating violence against women and domestic violence (CETS No. 210)|publisher=|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Quotation|Article 42 – Unacceptable justifications for crimes, including crimes committed in the name of '''so-called "honour"'''

1. Parties shall take the necessary legislative or other measures to ensure that, in criminal proceedings initiated following the commission of any of the acts of violence covered by the scope of this Convention, culture, custom, religion, tradition or '''so-called "honour"''' shall not be regarded as justification for such acts. This covers, in particular, claims that the victim has transgressed cultural, religious, social or traditional norms or customs of appropriate behaviour.

2. Parties shall take the necessary legislative or other measures to ensure that incitement by any person of a child to commit any of the acts referred to in paragraph 1 shall not diminish the criminal liability of that person for the acts committed.

The [[World Health Organization]] (WHO) addressed the issue of honor killings and stated: "Murders of women to 'save the family honour' are among the most tragic consequences and explicit illustrations of embedded, culturally accepted discrimination against women and girls."&lt;ref name="apps.who.int"&gt;http://apps.who.int/iris/bitstream/10665/77421/1/WHO_RHR_12.38_eng.pdf&lt;/ref&gt; According to the [[UNODC]]: "Honour crimes, including killing, are one of history's oldest forms of gender-based violence. It assumes that a woman's behaviour casts a reflection on the family and the community. ... In some communities, a father, brother or cousin will publicly take pride in a murder committed in order to preserve the 'honour' of a family. In some such cases, local justice officials may side with the family and take no formal action to prevent similar deaths."&lt;ref&gt;http://www.unodc.org/documents/justice-and-prison-reform/hb_eff_police_responses.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==In national legal codes==
Legislation on this issue varies, but today the vast majority of countries no longer allow a husband to legally kill a wife for [[adultery]] (although adultery itself continues to be [[punishable by death]] in some countries) or to commit other forms of honor killings. However, in many places, adultery and other "immoral" sexual behaviors by female family members can be considered [[mitigating circumstances]] in case when they are killed, leading to significantly shorter sentences.

In the [[Western world]], a country that is often associated with "crimes of passion" and adultery related violence is [[France]], and indeed, recent surveys have shown French public to be more accepting of these practices than the public in other countries. One 2008 Gallup survey compared the views of the French, German and British public and those of French, German and British Muslims on several social issues: 4% of French public said "honor killings" were "morally acceptable" and 8% of French public said "crimes of passion" were "morally acceptable"; honor killings were seen as acceptable by 1% of German public and also 1% of British public; crimes of passion were seen as acceptable by 1% of German public and 2% of British public. Among Muslims 5% in Paris, 3% in Berlin and 3% in London saw honor killings as acceptable, and 4% in Paris (less than French public), 1% in Berlin and 3% in London saw crimes of passion as acceptable.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.gallup.com/poll/107521/common-ground-europeans-muslims-among-them.aspx |title=Common Ground for Europeans and Muslims Among Them |publisher=Gallup.com |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the report of the [[United Nations Special Rapporteur]] submitted to the 58th session of the [[United Nations Commission on Human Rights]] in 2002 concerning cultural practices in the family that reflect violence against women (E/CN.4/2002/83):

:The Special Rapporteur indicated that there had been contradictory decisions with regard to the honour defense in [[Brazil]], and that legislative provisions allowing for partial or complete defence in that context could be found in the penal codes of [[Argentina]], [[Ecuador]], [[Egypt]], [[Guatemala]], [[Iran]], [[Israel]], [[Jordan]], [[Peru]], [[Syria]], [[Venezuela]] and the [[Palestinian National Authority]].&lt;ref name="unhchr"&gt;{{cite web|title=Working towards the elimination of crimes against women committed in the name of honour|url=http://www.unhchr.ch/huridocda/huridoca.nsf/AllSymbols/985168F508EE799FC1256C52002AE5A9/$File/N0246790.pdf|format=PDF|publisher=[[Office of the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights]]|accessdate=8 February 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legal aspects of honor killings in different countries are discussed below:

*[[Jordan]]: In recent years, Jordan has amended its Code to modify its laws which used to offer a complete defense for honor killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cam.ac.uk/research/news/belief-that-honour-killings-are-justified-still-prevalent-among-jordans-next-generation-study-shows|title=Belief that honour killings are 'justified' still prevalent among Jordan's next generation, study shows|date=20 June 2013|publisher=University of Cambridge|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Many former French colonies offer the possibility of reduced sentences in regard to adultery related violent crimes (inspired by the French Napoleonic Code).&lt;ref name="http://hbv-awareness.com/regions"/&gt;
*In [[Brazil]], an explicit defense to murder in case of adultery has never been part of the criminal code, but a defense of "honor" (not part of the criminal code) has been widely used by lawyers in such cases to obtain acquittals. Although this defense has been generally rejected in modern parts of the country (such as big cities) since the 1950s, it has been very successful in the interior of the country. In 1991 Brazil's Supreme Court explicitly rejected the "honour" defense as having no basis in Brazilian law.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.endvawnow.org/en/articles/738-decriminalization-of-adultery-and-defenses.html |title=Decriminalization of adultery and defenses |publisher=Endvawnow.org |accessdate=16 August 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Haiti]]: In 2005, the laws were changed, abolishing the right of a husband to be excused for murdering his wife due to adultery. Adultery was also decriminalized.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId=10312&amp;baseHREF=country&amp;baseHREFId=605 |title=The Secretary Generals database on violence against women |publisher=Sgdatabase.unwomen.org |accessdate=16 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224102644/http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/searchDetail.action?measureId=10312&amp;baseHREF=country&amp;baseHREFId=605 |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/uploads/Haiti%20-%20Decree%20Law%20on%20sexual%20assault%20%28fra%29.pdf |title=Le Moniteur: Journal Official de la Republique D'Haiti |date=11 August 2005 |publisher=Sgdatabase.unwomen.org |accessdate=16 August 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131224212850/http://sgdatabase.unwomen.org/uploads/Haiti%20-%20Decree%20Law%20on%20sexual%20assault%20%28fra%29.pdf |archivedate=24 December 2013 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;
*[[Syria]]: In 2009, Article 548 of the Syrian Law code was amended. Beforehand, the article waived any punishment for males who committed murder on a female family member for inappropriate sex acts.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"&gt;{{cite web|title=Syria: No Exceptions for Honor Killings|url=https://www.hrw.org/news/2009/07/28/syria-no-exceptions-honor-killings|publisher=Human Rights Watch|accessdate=8 December 2011|date=2009-07-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; Article 548 states that "He who catches his wife or one of his ascendants, descendants or sister committing adultery (''flagrante delicto'') or illegitimate sexual acts with another and he killed or injured one or both of them benefits from a reduced penalty, that should not be less than 2 years in prison in case of a killing." Article 192 states that a judge may opt for reduced punishments (such as short-term imprisonment) if the killing was done with an honorable intent. In addition to this, Article 242 says that a judge may reduce a sentence for murders that were done in rage and caused by an illegal act committed by the victim.&lt;ref name="Human Rights Watch"/&gt;
*[[Turkey]]: In Turkey, persons found guilty of this crime are sentenced to life in prison.&lt;ref name="suicide"&gt;{{cite web|title='Virgin suicides' save Turks' 'honor'|url=http://www.iht.com/articles/2006/07/12/news/virgins.php|author=Dan Bilefsky|publisher=''[[International Herald Tribune]]''|accessdate=12 July 2006}}&lt;/ref&gt; There are well documented cases, where Turkish courts have sentenced whole families to life imprisonment for an honor killing. The most recent was on 13 January 2009, where a Turkish Court sentenced five members of the same Kurdish family to life imprisonment for the honor killing of Naile Erdas, 16, who got pregnant as a result of rape.&lt;ref name="brisbanetimes.com.au"/&gt;
*[[Pakistan]]: Honor killings are known as ''karo kari'' ({{lang-sd|ڪارو ڪاري}}) ({{lang-ur|کاروکاری}}). The practice is supposed to be prosecuted under ordinary killing, but in practice police and prosecutors often ignore it.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Pakistan's honor killings enjoy high-level support|url=http://www.taipeitimes.com/News/world/archives/2004/07/24/2003180222|work=[[Taipei Times]]|accessdate=24 July 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; Often a man must simply claim the killing was for his honor and he will go free. [[Nilofar Bakhtiar]], advisor to [[Prime Minister of Pakistan|Prime Minister]] [[Shaukat Aziz]], stated that in 2003, as many as 1,261 women were killed in honor killings.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=Pakistan Tries to Curb 'Honor Killings'|url=https://www.nytimes.com/2004/10/27/international/asia/27stan.html?oref=login|last=Masood|first=Salman|work=[[New York Times]]|accessdate=27 October 2004 |date=27 October 2004}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Hudood Ordinances of Pakistan, enacted in 1979 by then ruler General Zia-ul-Haq, created laws that realigned Pakistani rule with Islamic law. The law had the effect of reducing the legal protections for women, especially regarding sex outside of the marriage. Women who made accusations of rape, after this law, were required to provide four male witnesses. If unable to do this, the alleged rape could not be prosecuted in the courts. Because the woman had admitted to sex outside of marriage, however, she could be punished for having sex outside of the marriage, a punishment that ranged from stoning to public lashing. This law made it that much more risky for women to come forward with accusations of rape. In 2006, the Women's Protection Bill amended these Hudood Ordinances by removing four male witnesses as a requirement for rape allegations.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Honor Code: How Moral Revolutions Happen|publisher=W.W. Norton and Company|author=Kwame Anthony Appiah}}&lt;/ref&gt; On 8 December 2004, under international and domestic pressure, Pakistan enacted a law that made honor killings punishable by a prison term of seven years, or by the death penalty in the most extreme cases.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Honor Killings Persist in 'Man's World'|url=http://worldblog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/09/12/1382073.aspx|author=Shahid Qazi|author2=Carol Grisanti|publisher=[[MSNBC]]|accessdate=12 September 2008|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080922004859/http://worldblog.msnbc.msn.com/archive/2008/09/12/1382073.aspx|archivedate=22 September 2008|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2016, Pakistan repealed the loophole which allowed the perpetrators of honour killings to avoid punishment by seeking forgiveness for the crime from another family member, and thus be legally pardoned.&lt;ref name="Loophole closed"/&gt; 
*[[Egypt]]: A number of studies on honor crimes by The Centre of Islamic and Middle Eastern Law, at the [[School of Oriental and African Studies]] in London, includes one which reports on Egypt's legal system, noting a gender bias in favor of men in general, and notably article 17 of the Penal Code: judicial discretion to allow reduced punishment in certain circumstance, often used in honor killings case.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Honour: Crimes, Paradigms and Violence Against Women |url=http://www.soas.ac.uk/honourcrimes/Publication_Abstracts.htm |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20091007231849/http://www.soas.ac.uk/honourcrimes/Publication_Abstracts.htm |archivedate=7 October 2009 |publisher=[[School of Oriental and African Studies]]|accessdate=27 September 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Support and Sanction==
Actions of Pakistani police officers and judges (particularly at the lower level of the judiciary &lt;ref name="amnesty1999"&gt;[https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa33/018/1999/en/ "Honor Killings in Pakistan"] . Amnesty.org. Retrieved 10/19/11.&lt;/ref&gt;) have, in the past, seemed to support the act of honor killings in the name of family honor. Police enforcement, in situations of admitted murder, do not always take action against the perpetrator. Also, judges in Pakistan (particularly at the lower level of the judiciary&lt;ref name="amnesty1999"/&gt;), rather than ruling cases with gender equality in mind, also seem to reinforce inequality and in some cases sanction the murder of women considered dishonorable.&lt;ref name="amnesty1999"/&gt; Often, a suspected honor killing never even reaches court, but in cases where they do, the alleged killer is often not charged or is given a reduced sentence of three to four years in jail. In a case study of 150 honor killings, the proceeding judges rejected only eight of claims that the women were killed for honor. The rest were sentenced lightly.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title=A Question of Honor|author=Suzanne Goldberg |url=https://www.theguardian.com/world/1999/may/27/gender.uk1|publisher=The Guardian|accessdate=9 December 2011|location=London|date=27 May 1999}}&lt;/ref&gt; In many cases in Pakistan, one of the reasons honor killing cases never make it to the courts, is because, according to some lawyers and women's right activists, Pakistani law enforcement do not get involved. Under the encouragement of the killer, police often declare the killing as a domestic case that warrants no involvement. In other cases, the women and victims are too afraid to speak up or press charges. Police officials, however, claim that these cases are never brought to them, or are not major enough to be pursued on a large scale.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=In Pakistan, Women Pay the Price of Honor|url=http://chora.virtualave.net/pakistan-women.htm|publisher=Washington Post|author=Pamela Constable|accessdate=8 December 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; The general indifference to the issue of honour killing within Pakistan is due to a deep-rooted [[gender bias]] in law, the police force, and the judiciary. In its report, "Pakistan: Honor Killings of Girls and Women",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amnesty.org/en/documents/asa33/018/1999/en/ |title=Honor Killings in Pakistan Amnesty.org Retrieved 06/03/12 |format=PDF |accessdate=1 October 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; published in September 1999, Amnesty International criticized governmental indifference and called for state responsibility in protecting human rights of female victims. To elaborate, Amnesty strongly requested the Government of Pakistan to take 1) legal, 2) preventive, and 3) protective measures. First of all, legal measures refer to a modification of the government's criminal laws to guarantee equal legal protection of females. On top of that, Amnesty insisted the government to assure legal access for the victims of crime in the name of honor. When it comes to preventive measures, Amnesty underlined the critical need to promote public awareness through the means of media, education, and public announcements. Finally, protective measures include ensuring a safe environment for activists, lawyers, and women's group to facilitate eradication of honor killings. Also, Amnesty argued for the expansion of victim support services such as shelters.

Kremlin-appointed [[President of the Chechen Republic|Chechen president]] [[Ramzan Kadyrov]] said that honor killings were perpetrated on those who deserved to die. He said that those who are killed have "loose morals" and are rightfully shot by relatives in honor killings. He did not vilify women alone but added that "If a woman runs around and if a man runs around with her, both of them are killed."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g3CnrQFlvyjHiDVHC-jXxegnNz7wD96KOKB00 |title=Chechen leader imposes strict brand of Islam |accessdate=2016-11-11 |deadurl=bot: unknown |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090304190227/https://www.google.com/hostednews/ap/article/ALeqM5g3CnrQFlvyjHiDVHC-jXxegnNz7wD96KOKB00 |archivedate=4 March 2009 |df=dmy-all}}.

In 2007, a famous Norwegian Supreme Court advocate stated that he wanted the punishment for the killing from 17 years in prison to 15 years in the case of [[honor killings]] practiced in [[Norway]]. He explained that the Norwegian public did not understand other cultures who practiced honor killings, or understand their thinking, and that Norwegian culture "is self-righteous".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Staff vil gi strafferabatt for æresdrap |publisher=Aftenposten |date=29 November 2007 |url=http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article2126407.ece |accessdate=23 November 2011 |language=Norwegian |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110629162945/http://www.aftenposten.no/nyheter/iriks/article2126407.ece |archivedate=29 June 2011 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Comparison to other forms of killing==
{{Main|Femicide}}
Honor killings are, along with [[dowry killing]]s (mostly in [[South Asia]]), gang-related killings of women as revenge (killings of female members of rival gang members' families – primarily, but not only, in [[Latin America]]) and [[witchcraft]] accusation killings ([[Africa]], [[Oceania]]) some of the most recognized forms of [[femicide|gender based killings]].&lt;ref name="genevadeclaration.org"/&gt;&lt;ref name="apps.who.int"/&gt;

[[Human rights]] advocates have compared "honor killings" to "[[crimes of passion]]" [[#Latin America|in Latin America]] (which are sometimes treated extremely leniently) and also to the killing of women for [[dowry system in India|lack of dowry in India]].&lt;ref name=r1/&gt;

Some commentators have stressed that the focus on honor killings should not lead to ignoring other forms of gender-based killings of women, in particular those from Latin America ('crimes of passion' and gang related killings); the murder rate of women in this region being extremely high, with [[El Salvador]] being reported as the country with the highest murder rate of women in the world.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.unwomen.org/en/news/stories/2013/4/femicide-in-latin-america|title=Femicide in Latin America|work=headQuarters|accessdate=20 April 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2002, Widney Brown, advocacy director for [[Human Rights Watch]], stated that "crimes of passion have a similar dynamic in that the women are killed by male family members and the crimes are perceived as excusable or understandable".&lt;ref name="news.nationalgeographic.com"/&gt;

The '''International Balloon Festival of Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu''' is the largest [[hot air balloon festival]] in [[Canada]]. It is held each August in [[Saint-Jean-sur-Richelieu]], [[Quebec]], about 40 minutes southeast of [[Montreal]] and about halfway between Montreal and [[Vermont]].

The festival is situated at the [[Saint-Jean Airport]] and weather permitting (no storm activity detected within range, {{convert|50|km|abbr=on}}, and winds above {{convert|12|km/h|abbr=on}}), there are two flight launches each day: a morning flight at 6:00 am and an evening flight between 6:00 and 7:00 pm. Other festival activities include amusement rides, musical and comedy shows and "Nuits magiques" (tethered night flights).

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2272">'''Kazuo Uzuki''' is the subject of a [[baseball card]] issued by [[Topps]] as an [[April Fools' Day]] [[hoax]]. The card was released on February 6, 2008 of a supposed [[high school]] superstar named Kazuo "The Uzi" Uzuki.  In [[Japanese language|Japanese]], Kazuo Uzuki means "the first son of April." The person actually depicted on the card was a [[New York University]] law student named Sensen Lin.

He is listed as 5'11" and 165&amp;nbsp;lbs and could supposedly throw a 104&amp;nbsp;mph pitch.  According to the card, Uzuki would be the first Japanese player to go straight from high school in [[Japan]] into [[MLB|professional baseball]] in the [[United States]].

The Uzuki rookie card was found in one out of every 72 packs of cards.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/baseball/mlb/04/01/topps.fools.ap/index.html?eref=mostpop |title=Topps prints card of fake star - Tuesday April 1, 2008 5:53PM |publisher=Sportsillustrated.cnn.com |date=2008-04-01|accessdate=2010-09-01|location=New York|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080402095411/http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/baseball/mlb/04/01/topps.fools.ap/index.html?eref=mostpop|archivedate=Apr 2, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;  When the card was released, people did not know that it was a joke and the card was trading for around $10–$15 on [[eBay]].  It was even the "card of the day" when it was released.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://cardboardmania.blogspot.com/2008/02/card-of-day-2008-topps-kazuo-uzuki-rc.html |title=Cardboard Mania: Card of the Day: 2008 Topps Kazuo Uzuki RC |publisher=Cardboardmania.blogspot.com |date=2008-02-09 |accessdate=2010-09-01}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Also, the card said that an [[MLB]] scout called him the best pitching prospect in 30 years and he is getting a astronomical deal. Also, the card says he threw 17 strikeouts in 7 innings at a [[World Baseball Classic|WBC]] squad trial.

The '''Lincoln Bible''' is the [[Bible]] owned by [[President of the United States|President]] [[Abraham Lincoln]], and was later used by [[Barack Obama]] at his inaugurations in [[First inauguration of Barack Obama|2009]] and [[Second inauguration of Barack Obama|2013]], as well as the [[inauguration of Donald Trump]] in 2017. The Lincoln family donated the Bible to the [[Library of Congress]], which includes it in their collection.

==Overview==
The Bible is an [[Oxford University Press]] edition of the [[King James Version|King James Bible]]. Published in 1853, it has 1280 pages, and measures approximately {{convert|6|in}} long by {{convert|4|in}} wide, and {{convert|1.75|in}} thick,&lt;ref name="ET"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://economictimes.indiatimes.com/ET_Cetera/Obama_first_Prez_to_use_Lincolns_Bible/articleshow/4008813.cms |title=Obama first president to use Lincoln's Bible |publisher=The Economic Times |date=January 20, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="LoC"/&gt; and is bound in [[burgundy red]] [[velvet]] with [[Gilding|gilt]] edges.&lt;ref name="LoC"&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.loc.gov/today/pr/2008/08-236.html |title=President-Elect Obama To Take Oath of Office on Lincoln-Inaugural Bible from Library of Congress |publisher=[[Library of Congress]] |date=December 23, 2008}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="MSNBC"/&gt; The back [[Book design#Front cover, spine, and back cover of the dust-jacket|flyleaf]] of the Bible bears the seal of the Supreme Court of the United States along with a record of the 1861 inauguration.&lt;ref name=usnews/&gt; The Bible is not a rare edition, and a similar Bible lacking the Lincoln Bible's historical significance would be valued at approximately $30 or $40.&lt;ref name=usnews/&gt;

==History==
[[file:Donald Trump swearing in ceremony.jpg|right|thumb|255px|[[Donald Trump]] using the Lincoln Bible (being held by wife [[Melania Trump]], with his personal bible on top of it) to take oath of office at his inauguration.]]
[[Abraham Lincoln]] reached [[Washington, D.C.]] for [[First inauguration of Abraham Lincoln|his inauguration]] in 1861. His belongings, including his Bible, had yet to arrive. William Thomas Carroll, the clerk of the [[Supreme Court of the United States|U.S. Supreme Court]], fetched a Bible that he kept for official use. This became the Lincoln Bible.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.cbsnews.com/2100-18563_162-4736457.html |title=The Real Story Of The Lincoln Bible |publisher=CBS News |date= |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the Bible remained with Carroll for a time, the Lincolns acquired it at an unknown time. The Bible later remained with the Lincoln family up until 1928, at which point [[Mary Eunice Harlan]], the widow of [[Robert Todd Lincoln]], donated it to the [[Library of Congress]].&lt;ref name=usnews&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.usnews.com/news/blogs/god-and-country/2008/12/23/the-story-behind-the-lincoln-bible-at-obamas-inauguration |title=The Story Behind the Lincoln Bible at Obama's Inauguration - God &amp; Country |publisher=usnews.com |date=2008-12-23 |accessdate=2012-08-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; When the Bible was donated, it contained markers at the 31st chapter of the [[Book of Deuteronomy]] and the fourth chapter of the [[Book of Hosea]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=https://news.google.com/newspapers?id=1XVFAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=obwMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=958,4959444&amp;dq=lincoln-bible&amp;hl=en |title=Lincoln's Bible Pages Marked: Was it Chance That Left Two Ribbon Markers At Passages?

The mission is named after the [[Lucy (Australopithecus)|'Lucy' hominin skeleton]], because the study of Trojans could reveal the "fossils of planet formation": materials that clumped together in the early history of the [[Solar System]] to form planets and other bodies.&lt;ref name="Nature2015"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.nature.com/news/five-solar-system-sights-nasa-should-visit-1.17119 |title=Five Solar System sights NASA should visit |work=[[Nature News]] |last=Witze |first=Alexandra |date=16 March 2015 |accessdate=2 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Australopithecus itself was named for a [[Beatles]] song, "[[Lucy in the Sky with Diamonds]]".&lt;ref name=Dinkinesh&gt;{{cite book |title=Lucy's Legacy: The Quest for Human Origins |publisher=[[Crown Publishing Group]] |date=2010 |last1=Johanson |first1=Donald C. |last2=Wong |first2=Kate |pages=8–9 |isbn=978-0-307-39640-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
[[File:InnerSolarSystem-en.png|thumb|left|upright=0.9|The [[Jupiter trojan]] asteroids are shown in green]]

''Lucy'' is planned to launch in 2021 and will arrive at the {{L4}} Trojan cloud (a group of asteroids that orbits about 60° ahead of Jupiter) in 2027, where it will fly by four Trojans, [[3548 Eurybates]], [[15094 Polymele]], [[11351 Leucus]], and [[21900 Orus]].&lt;ref name="NYT-20170106" /&gt; After these flybys, ''Lucy'' will return to the vicinity of the Earth whereupon it will receive a [[gravity assist]] to take it to the {{L5}} Trojan cloud (which trails about 60° behind Jupiter), where it will visit the [[Binary asteroid|binary]] Trojan [[617 Patroclus]] with its [[minor-planet moon|satellite]] Menoetius. ''Lucy'' will also fly by the inner main-belt asteroid [[52246 Donaldjohanson]], which was named for the discoverer of the Lucy hominin fossil.&lt;ref name="round 1"&gt;{{cite news |url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/casey-dreier/2015/09301336-discovery-downselect.html |title=NASA announces five Discovery proposals selected for further study |work=[[The Planetary Society]] |last=Dreier |first=Casey |last2=Lakdawalla |first2=Emily |date=30 September 2015 |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Three instruments comprise the payload: a high-resolution visible imager, an optical and near-infrared imaging spectrometer and a thermal infrared spectrometer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release |url=http://www.swri.org/press-release/swri-awarded-3-million-nasa-contract-develop-mission-jupiter%E2%80%99s-trojan-asteroids |title=SwRI awarded $3 million NASA contract to develop mission to Jupiter's Trojan asteroids |publisher=Southwest Research Institute |first=Rob |last=Leibold |date=2 October 2015 |accessdate=5 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Harold F. Levison]] of the [[Southwest Research Institute]] in Boulder, Colorado is the Principal Investigator with Catherine Olkin of [[Southwest Research Institute]] as the mission's Deputy Principal Investigator. NASA's [[Goddard Space Flight Center]] will manage the project.

Exploration of Jupiter Trojans was one of the high priority goals outlined in the [[Planetary Science Decadal Survey]].

Jupiter Trojans have been observed by ground-based telescopes and the [[Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer]] to be "dark with ... surfaces that reflect little sunlight".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://photojournal.jpl.nasa.gov/catalog/PIA16211 |title=Catalog Page for PIA16211 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Jupiter is {{convert|5.2|AU|e6km+e6mi|abbr=unit}} from the Sun, or about five times the Earth-Sun distance.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.nasa.gov/audience/forstudents/5-8/features/nasa-knows/what-is-jupiter-58.html |title=What Is Jupiter? |first=Jennifer |last=Wall |date=1 June 2015 |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Jupiter Trojans are at a similar distance but can be somewhat farther or closer to the Sun depending on where they are in their orbits. There may be as many Trojans as there are asteroids in the asteroid belt.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/casey-dreier/2015/09301336-discovery-downselect.html |title=NASA announces five Discovery proposals selected for further study |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
{{main|Selection of Discovery Mission 13 and 14}}
''Lucy'' was submitted as part of a call for proposals for the next mission(s) for [[Discovery Program]] that closed in February 2015. Proposals had to be ready to launch by the end of 2021. 28 proposals were received in all.

On 30 September 2015, ''Lucy'' was selected as one of five finalist missions, each of which received 3 million USD to produce more in-depth concept design studies and analyses.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.swri.org/9what/releases/2015/swri-nasa-contract-mission-jupiter-trojan-asteroid.htm#.VhUiX_Bdgnc |title=Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) 2015 News Release - SwRI awarded $3 million NASA contract to develop mission to Jupiter’s Trojan asteroids |publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="selection 1st round"&gt;{{cite news |last=Brown |first=Dwayne C. |last2=Cantillo |first2=Laurie |url=http://www.nasa.gov/press-release/nasa-selects-investigations-for-future-key-planetary-mission |title=NASA Selects Investigations for Future Key Planetary Mission |work=NASA News |location=Washington, D.C. |date=30 September 2015 |accessdate=1 October 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="laser2015"&gt;{{cite news |last=Clark |first=Stephen |url=http://spaceflightnow.com/2015/02/24/nasa-receives-proposals-for-new-planetary-science-mission/ |title=NASA receives proposals for new planetary science mission |work=Space Flight Now |date=24 February 2014 |accessdate=25 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Kane |first=Van |url=http://www.planetary.org/blogs/guest-blogs/van-kane/20141201-selecting-the-next-creative-discovery-mission.html |title=Selecting the Next Creative Idea for Exploring the Solar System |work=[[Planetary Society]] |date=2 December 2014 |accessdate=10 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Its fellow finalists were [[DAVINCI (spacecraft)|''DAVINCI'']], [[Near Earth Object Camera|NEOCam]], [[Psyche (spacecraft)|''Psyche'']] and [[VERITAS (spacecraft)|''VERITAS'']]. On 4 January 2017, two of the five proposals—''Lucy'' and ''Psyche''—were selected for development and launch.

'''MAGFest''' ('''M'''usic '''a'''nd '''G'''aming '''Fest'''ival, originally the Mid-Atlantic Gaming Festival) is an annual festival held in the [[Washington metropolitan area]] that celebrates [[video games]] and [[video game music]], as well as their surrounding [[Video game music culture|culture]]. MAGFest's primary features are a large open video gaming room, a hall of arcade cabinets, concerts by [[chiptune]] artists and video game cover bands, and a Bring Your Own Computer (BYOC) LAN Party.

== Attractions ==
MAGFest's arcade hall is open 24 hours a day.&lt;ref name=missed&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.destructoid.com/what-you-missed-at-magfest-8-159706.phtml|title=What you missed at MAGfest 8|first=Topher|last= Cantler}}&lt;/ref&gt; The exhibition hall contains hundreds of full size arcade cabinets, and even pinball machines that are donated for the event from local collectors and vending companies.  All arcades are set to play for free on admission price, and are monitored 24 hours a day by a maintenance and technical staff.  The arcade hall is decked out with specialty lighting, laser lighting, and music to bring back the golden age of arcades. The game selection ranges from 1970's vintage black and white games, vector monitors games, Cathode Ray Tube games, modern/Indie arcades; as well as contemporary Japanese candy cabinets and Japanese dance/music games like Dance Dance Revolution and Taiko No Tatsujin.  Arcades range from various manufacturers like Atari, Nintendo, Taito, Midway, Williams, Capcom, Sega, ICE, Rock Ola, and Exidy.  Games challenge various abilities including driving simulators, shooting simulators, labyrinth games, and just plain fun games.  There are multiple events and tournaments that occur during the event that allow you to challenge dozens of others for prizes and fame.  They also host a ten-game tournament that spans the entire event which allows players to openly compete on 10 classic arcade games to work on getting the highest scores possible with the ultimate prize being given to the player who scores the most points total on all games.

There is also a console hall open 24 hours a day that houses over a hundred televisions and attached game consoles, where guests are invited to play at will and each station's game is periodically swapped with a different one from a game library.  Attendees are encouraged to bring their own controllers or fighting game pads to compete with.  Consoles range from vintage Atari 2600, Intellivision style games all the way through the years to the most current and up to date Xbox/PS/Nintendo systems and games.  Even steam titles are playable and indie game developers have been known to introduce or beta test new games at the events.  Tournaments are performed frequently throughout the event on several platforms and game types for prizes.

The concert areas host nightly performances in multiple rooms simultaneously of famous and up and coming bands.  Music is themed, but not limited to; Chip Tunes, video game music, and related works. Many luminaries of video game music fan culture have performed at MAGFest. Previous bands include [[Machinae Supremacy]], [[Earthbound Papas]], [[Minibosses]], [[Powerglove (band)|Powerglove]], [[the NESkimos]], the Advantage and [[Chromelodeon]].

Other major attractions include guest panels from the video game industry such as [[Sid Meier]], [[Jon St. John]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.wired.com/geekdad/2009/11/magfest-2010-lineup-released|title=MAGFest 2010 Lineup Released | work=Wired | date=November 21, 2009}}&lt;/ref&gt; and [[Nobuo Uematsu]],&lt;ref name="npr.org"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.npr.org/2012/01/18/145347111/from-mega-man-to-final-fantasy-live-video-game-music|title=From Mega Man To Final Fantasy, Live Video Game Music}}&lt;/ref&gt; celebrated composer for many of the games in the [[Final Fantasy]] series. In addition, the fan remixing community is well represented with sites such as [[OverClocked ReMix]]. Filmmakers such as X-Strike Studios, Main Moon Productions, PBC Productions, and There Will Be Brawl have also appeared at the event. MAGFest has also included intellectually driven panels such as "Game Studies 101" where attendees were given a basic introduction to the manner in which scholars study video games.

Additionally, MAGFest features DJ battles, a jam space, an open mic stage, a large [[LAN party]] environment, a film screening room, a [[tabletop games|tabletop gaming]] room, vendors, contests like "name-that-tune," and a video game "challenge booth" where players can "try to tackle insanely difficult gaming feats for prizes of all sorts."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://terminalgamer.com/2010/01/05/recapping-magfest-8|title=Recapping MAGFest 8|first=Joe|last= Grogan}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== "MAGFest is a donut"/"MAGFest is not a donut" ==
The "MAGFest is a donut" and "MAGFest is not a donut" memes began when a man with username "MAGFest" posted "I am not a donut" after hearing a comparison of donuts to people. Today MAGFest uses a donut as a mascot and sells T-shirts featuring donuts. &lt;ref&gt;https://www.reddit.com/r/Magfest/comments/5ktwhc/can_someone_explain_how_donuts_came_to_be_a_thing/&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Mark Boslough''' is a physicist.   He was a member of the technical staff at [[Sandia National Laboratories]], an adjunct professor at [[University of New Mexico]], and a [[fellow]] of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]].&lt;ref name = CSI/&gt; He is an expert in the study of [[Impact event|planetary impacts]] and global [[Disaster|catastrophes]]. Due to his work in this field, [[Meanings of minor planet names: 73001–74000#73501–73600|Asteroid 73520 Boslough (2003 MB1)]] was named in his honor.&lt;ref name = Asteroid/&gt;

On March 13, 2018, Boslough announced he was a [[candidate]] for the [[New Mexico House of Representatives]] and would be challenging the [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] [[incumbent]] William Rehm in the [[primary election]]."&lt;ref name = Announcement/&gt;&lt;ref name = Primary/&gt;

==Background and education==
Boslough grew up in [[Broomfield, Colorado]].  He holds a B.S. in [[physics]] at [[Colorado State University]], and an MS and PhD in [[applied physics]] at the [[California Institute of Technology]].

==Scientific career==
[[Image:MarkBosloughTunguskaSimulation2007.jpeg|thumb|left|upright=.80|Asteroid impact fireball, from supercomputer simulation run by a [[Sandia National Laboratories|Sandia]] team led by Mark Boslough]]
An expert on planetary impacts and global catastrophes, Boslough's work on airbursts challenged the conventional view of [[asteroid]] collision risk and is now widely accepted by the scientific community.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.space.com/9256-forget-big-asteroids-smaller-rocks-sneak-blow.html |title=Forget Big Asteroids: It's the Smaller Rocks That Sneak In and Blow Up |publisher=Space.com |date=2010-10-05 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He was the first scientist to suggest that the Libyan Desert Glass was formed by melting due to overhead heating from an airburst.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last = Crawford|first = D A|author2 = Boslough|title = Silica '96:  Meeting on Libyan Desert Glass and related desert events|date = 18 July 1996|location = Bologna University, Italy}}&lt;/ref&gt;   His hypothesis was popularized by the documentaries "Tutunkhamun's Fireball" ([[BBC]]),&lt;ref&gt;https://www.imdb.com/name/nm2334005/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/2/hi/5196362.stm |title=Science/Nature &amp;#124; Tut's gem hints at space impact |publisher=BBC News |date=2006-07-19 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (recipient of [[Discover Magazine]]'s Top 100 Science Stories of 2006)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://discovermagazine.com/2007/jan/cover |title=The Top 100 Science Stories of 2006 |publisher=DISCOVER Magazine |date=2007-01-08 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Ancient Asteroid [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Ancient Asteroid Ancient Asteroid|url=http://channel.nationalgeographic.com/channel/videos/ancient-asteroid/|publisher=[[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]]|accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; which provided inspiration for the unorthodox and controversial notion that a large airburst over North America caused an abrupt climate change mass extinction.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=North American Comet Catastrophe 10,900 BC Part 2|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=I2ld-lohrPw#t=4m47s|accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, Boslough has been a leading critic of the [[Younger Dryas impact hypothesis]], arguing among other things that the proponents have misinterpreted his airburst models.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Boslough|first=Mark|title=Arguments and Evidence Against a Younger Dryas Impact Event|year=2012|publisher=GEOPHYSICAL MONOGRAPH SERIES 198|pages=13–26 |author2=K. Nicoll |author3=V. Holliday |author4=T. L. Daulton |author5=D. Meltzer |author6=N. Pinter |author7=A. C. Scott |author8=T. Surovell |author9=P. Claeys |author10=J. Gill |author11=F. Paquay |author12=J. Marlon |author13=P. Bartlein |author14=C. Whitlock |author15=D. Grayson |author16=A. J. T. Jull}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He appeared as a skeptic on the "Last Extinction" [[Nova]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/evolution/last-extinction.html |title=NOVA &amp;#124; Megabeasts' Sudden Death |publisher=Pbs.org |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; (recipient of AAAS Kavli award for best science documentary of 2009).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/about/tvaw.html |title=NOVA &amp;#124; Broadcast Awards Listed by Date |publisher=PBS |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2011, he presented a paper at the IAA Planetary Defense Conference in [[Bucharest]], [[Romania]], in which he stated, "It is virtually certain (probability &gt; 99%) that the next destructive NEO event will be an airburst."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Boslough|first=Mark|title=Airburst Warning and Response|url=https://cfwebprod.sandia.gov/cfdocs/CCIM/docs/2166721_boslough.pdf|accessdate=2013-09-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; This prediction proved true less than two years later, on Feb. 15, 2013, when an airburst over Chelyabinsk, Russia injured more than 1000 people. Boslough was among the first western scientists to arrive in [[Chelyabinsk]], where he did field research and accompanied a production crew filming Meteor Strike for NOVA.&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|title = Watch now: NOVA {{!}} Meteor Strike {{!}} PBS Video|url = http://video.pbs.org/video/2358778286/|accessdate = 2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt; Most of the documentaries are focused on his impact and airburst modeling.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.pbs.org/wgbh/nova/earth/modeling-comet-airburst.html |title=NOVA &amp;#124; Modeling a Comet Airburst |publisher=Pbs.org |date=2009-03-01 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In February 2011, it was announced that Boslough had been elected a [[fellow]] of the [[Committee for Skeptical Inquiry]].&lt;ref name = CSI&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.csicop.org/news/press_releases/show/csi_announces_new_fellows |title=CSI &amp;#124; Press Releases |publisher=[[Csicop.org]] |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2014, Boslough delivered a major address on "death plunge" asteroids that can pose a sudden danger to Earth at the second [[Starmus Festival]] in the [[Canary Islands]]. Also in 2014 he talks about his interest in asteroids to Toni Feder of Physics Today: "In his childhood home in Colorado, says Boslough, "there was a left-brain right-brain thing going on, with fiction and nonfiction in the same household."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title = A passion for asteroids|url = http://scitation.aip.org/content/aip/magazine/physicstoday/news/10.1063/PT.5.9020|journal = Physics Today|date = 2014-09-02|issn = 0031-9228|doi = 10.1063/PT.5.9020|first = Toni|last = Feder}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In recognition of Boslough's work in the field of [[Impact event|planetary impacts]] and global [[Disaster|catastrophes]], Asteroid 73520 Boslough (2003 MB1) was named in his honor.&lt;ref name = Asteroid&gt;{{cite web|title=JPL Small-Body Database Browser|url=http://ssd.jpl.nasa.gov/sbdb.cgi?orb=1;sstr=73520|publisher=[[NASA]]|accessdate=2012-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Scientific skepticism===
Boslough is a vocal critic of [[pseudoscience]] and [[anti-science]] and has written about [[climate change denial]] in the [[Skeptical Inquirer]] in reference to "[[Climategate]]" conspiracy theories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|author=Mark Boslough |url=http://www.csicop.org/si/show/mann_bites_dog_why_climategate_was_newsworthy |title=CSI &amp;#124; Mann Bites Dog: Why 'Climategate' Was Newsworthy |publisher=Csicop.org |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  He is also active in uncovering scientific misconduct.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://gsa.confex.com/gsa/2010AM/finalprogram/abstract_178248.htm |title=Misrepresentations Of Sargasso Sea Temperatures By Arthur B. Robinson Et Al |publisher=Gsa.confex.com |date=2010-11-03 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |author= |url=http://www.miller-mccune.com/science/comet-claim-comes-crashing-to-earth-31180/ |title=Comet Theory Comes Crashing to Earth |publisher=Miller-mccune.com |date=2011-05-14 |accessdate=2012-07-24 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120407090947/http://www.miller-mccune.com/science/comet-claim-comes-crashing-to-earth-31180/ |archivedate=2012-04-07 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Humor===
An advocate of using humor to defend science,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.santafenewmexican.com/Local%20News/April-Fools--Day-Sandia-labs-prankster---unleashed--cyberstorm- |title=Sandia labs prankster unleashed cyberstorm of laughs |publisher=The Santa Fe New Mexican |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; he once published an essay as an [[April Fool's Day]] joke in the April, 1998 issue of the [[New Mexicans for Science and Reason]] newsletter to poke fun at [[New Mexico]]'s legislature for attempting to require schools to teach creationism.  He wrote that the [[Alabama]] state legislature had voted to change the value of the mathematical constant [[pi]] from 3.14159 to the 'Biblical value' of 3.0.  The article was posted on a newsgroup and passed around to people via email, causing an outrage.  When people started calling the Alabama legislature to protest, the joke was revealed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.nmsr.org/alabama.htm |title=Alabama π! |publisher=Nmsr.org |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  [[National Geographic Society|National Geographic]] News highlighted Boslough's story when it compiled a list of "some of the more memorable hoaxes in recent history."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.nationalgeographic.com/news/2004/03/0331_040331_aprilfoolshoax.html |title=April Fools' Special: History's Hoaxes |publisher=News.nationalgeographic.com |date=2010-10-28 |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It was elevated by the [[Museum of Hoaxes]] to number seven on its "Top 100 April Fools Hoaxes of All Time" list.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.museumofhoaxes.com/hoax/aprilfool/ |title=Top 100 April Fool's Day Hoaxes Of All Time |publisher=Museumofhoaxes.com |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;  It eventually took on a new existence as an urban legend and has had to be debunked by [[Snopes]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/religion/pi.asp |title=Redefinition of Pi |publisher=snopes.com |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He also demonstrated that emailed lists of "[[Darwin Awards]]" include fake stories.  After receiving an annual list of unfortunate deaths at the end of 1998, he fabricated his own over-the-top fictional Darwin Award recipient, appended it, and forwarded the list to his friends.   That story also went viral, was printed as an actual event by the [[Denver Post]], leading to another debunking by Snopes.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.snopes.com/horrors/techno/microwave.asp |title=Microwaved Workman |publisher=snopes.com |accessdate=2012-07-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Political career ==
In a tweet on March 13, 2018, Boslough announced he was a [[candidate]] for the [[New Mexico House of Representatives]], saying  "I will be on the [[Primary election|primary ballot]] on June 5, 2018. I am challenging the [[incumbent]] [[National Rifle Association|NRA]]-supported candidate, William Rehm, in NM district 31."&lt;ref name = Announcement&gt;{{cite web|title=I have officially declared my candidacy...|url=https://twitter.com/MarkBoslough/status/973739446691495936|website=Twitter|publisher=Twitter|accessdate=16 March 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/lMrXL|archivedate=16 March 2018|date=13 March 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to the ''New Mexico Political Report'':

{{Quote|text=Republican Bill Rehm is in one of the most [[Republican Party (United States)|Republican]] districts in the state. So his biggest challenge could be Mark Boslough, a scientist from Sandia Labs, in the primary... The winner of the primary will face a Libertarian opponent, William Arnold Wiley Jr.&lt;ref name = Primary&gt;{{cite web|last1=Reichbach|first1=Matthew|title=2018 House: The primaries|url=http://nmpoliticalreport.com/813719/house-gop-leader-retirement-shock-on-legislative-filing-day/|website=NMpoliticalreport.com|publisher=NM Political Report|accessdate=16 March 2018|archiveurl=https://archive.is/NSMki|archivedate=16 March 2018|date=13 March 2018|dead-url=no}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

===Private property rights===
Boslough is an advocate of laws to reform the 19th-century law known as [[Revised statute 2477|RS 2477]] to prevent it from being used to take private property for public use.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|title = ESR {{!}} February 23, 2004 {{!}} RS 2477 reform is needed to protect private property|url = http://www.enterstageright.com/archive/articles/0204/0204rs2477.htm|website = www.enterstageright.com|accessdate = 2015-07-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;  His fight turned into a prolonged battle with off-road clubs pulling out boulders and seedlings that Boslough used to try and restore his property.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Cart|first = Julie|title = Rights (Page 2 of 2) Dust-Up Over Off-Roaders Roars Across Backcountry|url = http://articles.latimes.com/2003/sep/21/local/me-offroad21/2|publisher = [[LA Times]]|accessdate = 12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He also received verbal and physical threats before he successfully defended a lawsuit (Ramey v. Boslough) in which the ownership of a four-wheel-drive road across his Colorado property was challenged by a plaintiff who was backed by off-road recreation interests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title = The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly|url = http://saveourcanyons.org/files/images/Autumn%2007%20NL.pdf|publisher = Citizens' Committee to Save Our Canyons|accessdate = 12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;   He used this experience to argue that the "right to radiate" is a prescriptive private property right, and that carbon polluters must compensate individuals for degrading their personal cooling capacity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last = Boslough|first = Mark|title = The Right to Radiate|url = http://www.huffingtonpost.com/mark-boslough/the-right-to-radiate_b_1709866.html|publisher = Huff Post|accessdate = 12 February 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coin debasement''' is the act of decreasing the amount of precious metal in a coin, while continuing to circulate it at face value. This was frequently done by governments in order to [[inflation|inflate]] the amount of currency in circulation; typically, some of the precious metal was replaced by a cheaper metal when the coin was minted. But when done by an individual, precious metal was physically removed from the coin, which could then be passed on at the original face value, leaving the debaser with a profit. Coin debasement was effected by several methods, including '''clipping''' (shaving metal from the coin's circumference) and '''sweating''' (shaking the coins in a bag and collecting the dust worn off).

Until the mid-20th century, coins were often made of [[silver]] or [[gold]], which were quite soft and prone to wear. This meant coins naturally got lighter (and thus less valuable) as they aged, so coins that had lost a small amount of [[bullion]] would go unnoticed. Modern coins are made of hard, cheap metals such as [[steel]], [[copper]], or a [[copper-nickel]] alloy, reducing wear and making it difficult and unprofitable to debase them.

Clipping is the act of shaving off a small portion of a precious metal coin for profit. Over time, the precious metal clippings could be saved up and melted into bullion or used to make new coins.&lt;ref name="cooper-2008"&gt;

Coin clipping was usually considered by the law to be of a similar magnitude to [[counterfeit]]ing, and was occasionally punished by [[capital punishment|death]],&lt;ref name="cooper-2008"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;See for example the English [[Treason Act 1415]].&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Allen|2009|p=71}} a fate which befell English counterfeiters [[Thomas Rogers and Anne Rogers]] in 1690.

Coin clipping is why many coins have the rim of the coin [[reeding|marked with stripes]] (''milling'' or ''reeding''), text (''[[engraving]]'') or some other pattern that would be destroyed if the coin were clipped. This practice is attributed to [[Isaac Newton]], who was appointed [[Master of the Mint]] in 1699.&lt;ref name="Division1986"&gt;{{cite book|author=Great Britain. Treasury.

In the process of sweating, coins were placed in a bag and shaken. The bits of metal that had worn off the coins were recovered from the bottom of the bag.{{sfn|Sherwood|1893|p=70}} Sweating tended to wear the coin in a more natural way than clipping, and so was harder to detect.{{sfn|Allen|2009|p=72}}

If the coin was large, a hole could be punched out of the middle, and the face of the coin hammered to close up the hole.{{sfn|Sherwood|1893|p=70–71}} Or the coin could be sawed in half, and a plug of metal extracted from the interior. After filling the hole with a cheaper metal, the two halves would be welded back together again.{{sfn|Sherwood|1893|p=71}} Verbal references to plugged quarters and plugged dimes eventually yielded the common phrase ''"not worth a plugged nickel"'' (or 'plug nickel', or even a plugged cent), emphasizing the worthlessness of such a tampered coin.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/260800.html|title=The meaning and origin of the expression: Not worth a plugged nickel|publisher=Phrase Dictionary|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160410020340/http://www.phrases.org.uk/meanings/260800.html|archivedate=2016-04-10|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The {{nihongo|'''''Morrison'' incident'''|モリソン号事件|Morison-gō Jiken}} of 1837 occurred when the [[United States|American]] merchant ship, ''Morrison'' headed by [[Charles W. King]], was driven away from "[[sakoku]]" (isolationist) [[Japan]] by cannon fire. This was carried out in accordance with the Japanese [[Edict to Repel Foreign Vessels]] of 1825.

==History==
In addition to its commercial aims, the ship was attempting to repatriate seven shipwrecked Japanese citizens who had been picked up in [[Macau]]. It also carried Christian missionaries such as [[Samuel Wells Williams]]. 

The nature of the ship's mission became known one year after the event, and this resulted in increased criticism of the Edict.

== Notes ==
Among the Japanese [[castaway]]s was [[Otokichi|Yamamoto Otokichi]], who became known for his role in bridging the cultural gap between Japan and rest of the world.

The '''National Service-Learning Conference''' was first held in 1988 to serve as "the largest gathering of youth and practitioners from the service-learning movement" of the United States. The conference is a program of the [[National Youth Leadership Council]], and is co-hosted annually by partner organizations in the state or region where it is being held. Sponsors of the conference include [[United Parcel Service]], [[Best Buy]], [http://www.sef.org Shinnyo-en Foundation], [[United Way of America]], and E. Ronald and Patricia Parish.

The conference focuses on service-learning, an approach to teaching and learning in which students use academic knowledge and skills to address genuine community needs. Annually, the National Service-Learning Conference convenes teachers and other service-learning practitioners, administrators, researchers, policy-makers, youth leaders, parents, program coordinators, national service members, community-based organization staffs, and corporate and foundation officers. The conference is unique because typically youth comprise more than half its attendees and are treated as equal contributors. Youth present, exhibit, and attend the three-and-a-half-day event same as their adult counterparts.

Each year the conference features over 200 workshop sessions, thought-leader sessions, keynote addresses, an interactive exhibit hall with a service-learning showcase and college fair, both on- and off-site service-learning projects to allow participants an authentic learning opportunity, an administrator's academy, indigenous service-learning forum, preconference sessions for in-depth learning, as well as countless networking and professional development opportunities. Speakers from around the world present on international issues and help to ground the conference in a rapidly globalizing world. Artists, students, and community members from the host locale contribute to the ambiance of the conference each year. The hallways, exhibit hall aisles, and general spaces are transformed with spoken word, drumming, murals, paintings, etc. The conference takes on the culture of the city that hosts it, from the local food that is served to service projects that provide a deeper understanding of the host city.

For 2012, the conference was co-hosted with [http://www.youthrive.net/ youthrive], the upper midwest affiliate of [[PeaceJam]], and presented as The 23rd Annual National Service-Learning Conference &amp; youthrive PeaceJam Leadership Conference. In addition to the full range of conference workshops and activities, the partnership with youthrive PeaceJam brought Nobel Laureate [[Shirin Ebadi]] as a featured speaker, and the week-long event ended with a celebration of [[Global Youth Service Day]] at the [[Mall of America]].

The Service-Learning World Forum began in 2008 as a pre-conference session of the larger conference and is now an integral program of the larger conference. The World Forum engages attendees with international leaders, exploring youth service and service-learning as forces that span cultural and national boundaries, building communities and strengthening young people. World Forum attendees discover how service-learning is implemented from Ireland, to Argentina, to the Middle East, and is useful for both those working internationally and those interested in expanding their programs.

Each year since 2003 the conference has highlighted the National Service-Learning Awards. Awards are presented to leaders in the field of service-learning, both youths and adults. In 2006 the first William James National Service Lifetime Achievement Award was presented by the National Youth Leadership Council in conjunction with several leading service organizations. The award was given to former Senator Harris Wofford and presented by President Bill Clinton, Kathleen Kennedy Townsend, and Dr. James Kielsmeier. Since its inception, the conference has planted trees in each city that has hosted the event, in honor of the service-learning award winners.

The October 2009 issue of ''One+'' magazine featured a four-page article highlighting the conference and its commitment to the community. One+ magazine is the official publication of Meeting Planners International. One+ is the leading voice of the meeting and event industry, reaching 30,000+ industry professionals on six continents.

The '''Odrysian Kingdom''' ({{IPAc-en|oʊ|ˈ|d|r|ɪ|ʒ|ə|n}}; [[Ancient Greek]]: {{lang|grc|Βασίλειον Ὀδρυσῶν}}; {{lang-la|Regnum Odrysium}}) was a state union of over 40&amp;nbsp;[[Thracians|Thracian]] tribes&lt;ref name=Thrace /&gt; and 22&amp;nbsp;kingdoms&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2013-09/05/c_132695455.htm|title=Interview: Capital of largest Thracian kingdom discovered in Bulgaria|website=xinhuanet.com|access-date=2016-05-26|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20170204062009/http://news.xinhuanet.com/english/world/2013-09/05/c_132695455.htm|archive-date=2017-02-04|dead-url=yes|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; that existed between the 5th&amp;nbsp;century BC and the 1st&amp;nbsp;century AD. It consisted mainly of present-day [[Bulgaria]], spreading to parts of Southeastern [[Romania]] ([[Northern Dobruja]]), parts of Northern [[Greece]] and parts of modern-day [[Eastern Thrace|European Turkey]].

It is suggested that the kingdom had no capital. Instead, the kings may have moved between residences.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Borza|first1=Eugene|title=In the Shadow of Olympus: The Emergence of Macedon|url=https://books.google.com/?id=614pd07OtfQC&amp;pg=PA145&amp;dq=odrysian+capital#v=onepage&amp;q=odrysian%20capital&amp;f=false|publisher=[[Princeton University]] Press|isbn=0-691-00880-9|year=1992}}&lt;/ref&gt; A capital was the city of Odryssa (assumed to be Uscudama, modern [[Edirne]]),&lt;ref name=Thrace /&gt; as inscribed on coins. Another royal residence believed to have been constructed by [[Cotys I (Odrysian)|Cotys&amp;nbsp;I]] (383-358&amp;nbsp;BC) is in the village of [[Starosel]], while in 315&amp;nbsp;BC [[Seuthopolis]] was built as a capital.&lt;ref name=Thrace /&gt; An early capital was [[Vize]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Faudot|first1=Murielle|title=Pont-Euxin Et Polis|url=https://books.google.com/?id=aQLEB9vikZ8C&amp;pg=PA177&amp;dq=odrysian+capital#v=onepage&amp;q=odrysian%20capital&amp;f=false|isbn=9782848671062|date=2005-01-01}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kingdom broke up and [[Kabyle (ancient city)|Kabyle]] was a co-capital by the end of the 4th&amp;nbsp;century BC.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last1=Chudnoff |first1=Yoav |title=Kabile: When One is Curious |url=http://www.novinite.com/articles/168495/Kabile%3A+When+One+Is+Curious}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== The Odrysians ==
The Odrysians (Odrysae or Odrusai, [[Ancient Greek]]: Ὀδρύσαι) were one of the most powerful Thracian tribes that dwelled in the plain of the [[Maritsa|Hebrus]] river.&lt;ref&gt;Harry Thurston Peck, Harpers Dictionary of Classical Antiquities (1898),"(Odrusai). The most powerful people in Thrace, dwelling in the plain of the Hebrus, whose king, Sitalces, in the time of the Peloponnesian War, exercised dominion over almost the whole of Thrace. (See Thracia.) The poets often use the adjective Odrysius in the general sense of Thracicus."&lt;/ref&gt; This would place the tribe in the modern border area between Southeastern Bulgaria, Northeastern Greece and European Turkey, centered around the city of [[Edirne]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=OGBGauNBK8kC&amp;pg=PA605 |publisher=Cambridge University Press |page=605 |title=The Cambridge Ancient History |isbn=978-0-521-22717-9 |date=1992 |volume=3 |author1=John Boardman |author2=I. E. S. Edwards |author3=E. Sollberger |author4=N. G. L. Hammond }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;The Thracians 700 BC-AD 46 (Men-at-Arms) by Christopher Webber and Angus McBride,2001, {{ISBN|1-84176-329-2}}, page 5&lt;/ref&gt; The river [[Arda River (Maritsa)|Artescus]]&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus, The Histories (ed. A. D. Godley),4.92.1,"XCII. From there, Darius set out and came to another river called Artescus, which flows through the country of the Odrysae; and having reached this river, he pointed out a spot to the army, and told every man to lay one stone as he passed in this spot that he pointed out. After his army did this, he led it away, leaving behind there great piles of stones."&lt;/ref&gt; passed through their land as well. [[Xenophon]]&lt;ref&gt;Xenophon, Hellenica, 3.2.1, But when the Odrysians returned, they first buried their dead, drank a great deal of wine in their honour, and held a horse-race; and then, from that time on making common camp with the Greeks, they continued to plunder Bithynia and lay it waste with fire.&lt;/ref&gt; writes that the Odrysians held horse races and drank large amounts of wine after the burial of their dead warriors. [[Thucydides]] writes on their custom, practised by most Thracians, of giving gifts for getting things done,&lt;ref&gt;The History of the Peloponnesian War
By Thucydides,"For there was here established a custom opposite to that prevailing in the Persian kingdom, namely, of taking rather than giving; more disgrace being attached to not giving when asked than to asking and being refused; and although this prevailed elsewhere in Thrace, it was practised most extensively among the powerful Odrysians, it being impossible to get anything done without a present".&lt;/ref&gt; which was refuted by Heraclides. [[Herodotus]] was the first writer to mention the Odrysae.

== History ==
Thrace had been part of the [[Achaemenid Empire|Persian empire]] since 516&amp;nbsp;BC&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Classical Dictionary by Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth, {{ISBN|0-19-860641-9}},"page 1515,"The Thracians were subdued by the Persians by 516"&lt;/ref&gt; during the rule of [[Darius the Great]], and was re-subjugated by [[Mardonius (general)|Mardonius]] in 492&amp;nbsp;BC.&lt;ref&gt;Herodotus,6.43.1&lt;/ref&gt; During Persian rule, it made part of the [[Skudra]] [[satrapy]] (province). Parts were occupied by [[Scythians]] and Greek colonists earlier besides the numerous later invasions.

The Odrysian state was the first Thracian kingdom that acquired power in the region, by the unification&lt;ref&gt;Readings in Greek History: Sources and Interpretations by D. Brendan Nagle and Stanley M. Burstein, {{ISBN|0-19-517825-4}}, 2006, page&amp;nbsp;230: "... , however, one of the Thracian tribes, the Odrysians, succeeded in unifying the Thracians and creating a powerful state ..."&lt;/ref&gt; of many [[List of Thracian tribes|Thracian tribes]] under a single ruler, King [[Teres I|Teres]],&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Classical Dictionary by Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth, {{ISBN|0-19-860641-9}}, page&amp;nbsp;1515,"Shortly afterwards the first King of the Odrysae, Teres attempted to carve an empire out of the territory occupied by the Thracian tribes (Thuc.2.29 and his sovereignty extended as far as the Euxine and the Hellespont)"&lt;/ref&gt; probably in the 470s&amp;nbsp;BC after the [[Second Persian invasion of Greece|Persian defeat]] in Greece.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/?id=0oKx4FyAOOQC&amp;pg=PA221&amp;dq=Teres+I+odrysian+kingdom+persian#v=onepage&amp;q=Teres%20I%20odrysian%20kingdom%20persian&amp;f=false |title=The Expedition of Cyrus |accessdate=24 December 2014 |isbn=978-0-19-160504-8 |author1=Xenophon |date=2005-09-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

M. Lewis |author2=John Boardman |author3=Simon Hornblower }}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Sitalces]] the state was at its [[zenith]] and extended from the [[Black Sea]] to the east, [[Danube]] to the north, the region populated with the tribe called [[Triballi]] to the north-west, and the basin of the river [[Struma (river)|Strymon]] to the south-west and towards the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] - present-day [[Bulgaria]], Romanian [[Northern Dobruja|Dobruja]], Turkish [[East Thrace]] and Greek [[Western Thrace]] between the [[Maritsa|Hebrus]] and the [[Struma (river)|Strymon]], except the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] and [[Black Sea|Black]] seas coasts mostly occupied by Greek cities.&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Classical Dictionary by Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth, {{ISBN|0-19-860641-9}}, page&amp;nbsp;1514, "the kingdom of the Odrysae the leading tribe of Thrace extented ver present-day Bulgaria, Turkish Thrace (east of the Hebrus) and Greece between the Hebrus and Strymon except for the coastal strip with its Greek cities"&lt;/ref&gt; Sovereignty was never exercised over all of its lands as it varied in relation to tribal politics.

Historian Z.H. Archibald writes:
&lt;blockquote&gt;
''The Odrysians created the first state entity which superseded the tribal system in the east Balkan peninsula. Their kings were usually known to the outside world as kings of Thrace, although their power did not extend by any means to all Thracian tribes. Even within the confines of their kingdom the nature of royal power remained fluid, its definition subject to the dictates of geography, social relationships, and circumstance''
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

This large territory was populated with a number of Thracian and [[Daco]]-[[Moesian]] tribes that united under the reign of a common ruler, and began to implement common internal and external policies. These were favorable conditions for overcoming the tribal divisions, which could lead gradually to the formation of a more stable ethnic community. This was not realised and the period of power of the Odrysian kingdom was brief. Despite the attempts of the Odrysian kings to bolster their central power, the separatist tendencies were very strong. Odrysian military strength was based on intra-tribal elites&lt;ref&gt;The Odrysian Kingdom of Thrace: Orpheus Unmasked (Oxford Monographs on Classical Archaeology) by Z. H. Archibald, 1998, {{ISBN|0-19-815047-4}}, page&amp;nbsp;149&lt;/ref&gt; making the kingdom prone to fragmentation. Some tribes were rioting constantly and tried to separate, while others remained outside the borders of the kingdom. At the end of the 5th and the beginning of the 4th&amp;nbsp;century BC, as a result of conflicts, the Odrysian kingdom split into three parts.&lt;ref&gt;Lysimachus: A Study in Early Hellenistic Kingship by Dr Helen S Lun, page&amp;nbsp;19, "... Profiting from dynastic rivalries which had split the powerful Odrysian kingdom into three realms, in 341&amp;nbsp;BC Philip&amp;nbsp;II finally ..."&lt;/ref&gt; The political and military decline continued, while Macedonia was rising as a dangerous and ambitious neighbour.&lt;ref&gt;Fol, Alexander. ''Demographic and Social Structure of Ancient Thrace''.&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the Greek historians [[Herodotus]] and [[Thucydides]], a royal dynasty emerged from among the Odrysian tribe in [[Thrace]] around the end of the 5th&amp;nbsp;century BC, which came to dominate much of the area and peoples between the [[Danube]] and the [[Aegean Sea|Aegean]] for the next century. Later writers, royal coin issues, and inscriptions indicate the survival of this dynasty into the early 1st&amp;nbsp;century AD, although its overt political influence declined progressively first under [[Persia]]n, [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonian]], later [[Ancient Rome|Roman]], encroachment. Despite their demise, the period of Odrysian rule was of decisive importance for the future character of south-eastern Europe, under the Roman Empire and beyond.

Teres' son, [[Sitalces]], proved to be a good military leader, forcing the tribes that defected the alliance to acknowledge his sovereignty. The rich state that spread from the Danube to the Aegean built roads to develop trade and built a powerful army. In 429 BC, [[Sitalces]] allied himself with the [[Athenians]]&lt;ref&gt;The Oxford Classical Dictionary by Simon Hornblower and Antony Spawforth, {{ISBN|0-19-860641-9}}, page&amp;nbsp;1515, "Sitalces allied himself with the Athenians against the Macedonians"&lt;/ref&gt; and organized a massive campaign against the [[Ancient Macedonians|Macedonians]], with a vast army from independent Thracian and [[Paeonian]] tribes. According to Thucydides, it included as many as 150,000 men, but was obliged to retire through the failure of provisions, and the coming winter.&lt;ref&gt;Thucydides. ''History of the Peloponnesian War'', ii. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Greek language|Greek]] as a [[lingua franca]] had been spoken at least by some members of the royal household in the fifth century and became the language of administrators; the Greek alphabet was adopted for a new [[Thracian language|Thracian]] script.&lt;ref&gt;The Odrysian Kingdom of Thrace: Orpheus Unmasked (Oxford Monographs on Classical Archaeology) by Z. H. Archibald, 1998, {{ISBN|0-19-815047-4}} page&amp;nbsp;3&lt;/ref&gt;

After the kingdom had split itself in three semi-independent kingdoms [[Philip II of Macedon]] invaded and conquered much of Thrace. Some Odrysian kings and other Thracian tribes were submitted and paid taxes at times during different periods to Philip II, [[Alexander the Great]] and [[Philip V of Macedon|Philip&amp;nbsp;V]]. Two of the three kingdoms were forced into vassal status by Philip&amp;nbsp;II in 352&amp;nbsp;BC, while in 342-341&amp;nbsp;BC he conquered the Odrysian heartland deposing reigning kings or rebelled vassals. Nevertheless, [[Seuthes III]] (341-300&amp;nbsp;BC) had survived the expansion of Philip, maintaining continuity of the kingdom probably only as a client on a power-sharing basis with the appointed Macedonian [[satrap]] of Thrace [[Lysimachus]] in 323&amp;nbsp;BC. But Seuthes had warred often against Lysimachus and set the capital at [[Seuthopolis]] from 320&amp;nbsp;BC until it was sacked by the Celts in 281&amp;nbsp;BC. By 212&amp;nbsp;BC an army led by an Odrysian king Pleuratus destroyed the Celtic kingdom and its capital [[Tylis]]. The Odrysian kingdom had maintained continuity with its own kings, but broken up into several kingdoms (including Canite and Odrissae) by the early second century BC, until succumbing to complete Roman conquest in 146&amp;nbsp;BC. In 100&amp;nbsp;BC a Thracian kingdom was restored, possibly by a son of [[Beithys]], one of the last kings of the Odrissae, it is not clear if it was a vassal of Rome or entirely independent. Several years later, some Thracians and Celts overran the southern Balkans, [[Epirus]], [[Dalmatia]] and northern Greece, and penetrated the [[Peloponnese]]. A kingdom of another Odrysian bloodline had re-emerged in 55 BC ([[Sapaeans|Sapei]]) and by 30&amp;nbsp;BC it conquered or otherwise controlled the other Odrysian kingdom (Antaea), although it, along with{{Clarify|reason=Were they part of the same proxy entity, did they each instead constitute a separate proxy entity, or something in between?|date=November 2017}} other Thracian tribes, became a Roman proxy soon afterward. By 11&amp;nbsp;BC, the uncle of the Roman emperor [[Augustus]] was the Odrysian king, easing the gradual Romanization of the region. The Odrysian king was murdered by his wife and his kingdom was completely subjected to Rome in 46&amp;nbsp;AD.&lt;ref name=Thrace /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsEurope/GreeceMacedonia.htm#Romans|title=Kingdoms of Greece - Macedonians|first=P L|last=Kessler|website=www.historyfiles.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="auto"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.historyfiles.co.uk/KingListsEurope/GreeceThraceSapes.htm|title=Kingdoms of Greece - Sapes (Thrace)|first=P L|last=Kessler|website=www.historyfiles.co.uk}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bosworth|title=Conquest and Empire: The Reign of Alexander the Great|publisher=Cambridge University Press|page=12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Thracian clothing]] is regarded for its quality and texture and was made up of [[hemp]], [[flax]] or [[wool]].  Their clothing resembled that of the [[Scythians]] including [[jacket]]s with colored edges, pointed shoes and the Getai tribe were so similar to the Scythians that they were often confused with them.

The '''Pflasterspektakel''' ({{IPA-de|ˈpflastɐʃpɛkˌtakl̩|pron}}, [[German language|German]] for ''pavement spectacle'') is an annual street art [[festival]] in [[Linz]], the capital of [[Upper Austria]]. It includes musical acts, [[juggling]], [[acrobatics]], [[pantomime]], [[improvisational theatre]], [[clown]]ery, [[fire dancing]], painting, [[samba]] parades, as well as a programme for children, and is held on three days in July in and around the main square and the Landstraße. In 2010, about 400 artists from over forty nations participated in the event.&lt;ref name="Standard" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Kurier" /&gt;

==History==
The Pflasterspektakel was created by [[Siegbert Janko]], cultural manager of Linz since 1985. He ascribes the idea to his impressions of [[Djemaa el Fna]], a market place in [[Marrakesh]], which he visited during birthday celebrations for King [[Hassan II of Morocco]] before 1985.

The inaugural festival took place from 16 to 19 July 1987, under the name of ''Internationale Straßenmusikantentage'' (''International Street Musicians' Days''). It comprised about 150 musicians, most of them from Austria and [[Germany]], including a samba group from [[Munich]]. It was decided that the event should be repeated the following year, this time under the present name of ''Linz Pflasterspektakel'' and featuring acrobats, magicians and [[mime]]s in addition to the musicians.

1989, shortly before the fall of the [[Berlin Wall]], artists from [[Eastern Bloc]] countries performed in Linz. From this year onwards, organisers had to select artists because there were more applications than could be accommodated. In 2000, as well as some of the following years, over 250,000 visitors attended the Pflasterspektakel to see artists from Europe, the Americas, Asia, Africa, and Australia.&lt;ref name="Pflasterspektakel" /&gt;

==Time and locations==
The Pflasterspektakel takes place on three days during the second half of July. The opening ceremony is held on a Thursday at 4 p.m.; on the following Friday and Saturday, the festival starts at 2 p.m. Closing time is at midnight each day, but some musicians play in pubs until 1 a.m. By tradition, spontaneously formed groups of artists improvise a finale (or several finales) on Saturday evening on the main square.

Artists are performing at around forty locations throughout the city of Linz, in and around the main square and the Landstraße. Two courtyards are reserved for musicians playing [[acoustic music|unplugged]] or [[a cappella]].&lt;ref name="Pflasterspektakel" /&gt; In case of rain, the event moves to the old city hall and other indoor locations.&lt;ref name="Standard" /&gt;

==Funding==
The event is sponsored by the [[municipality]] as well as [[Radio Oberösterreich]], local newspapers, and a bank. The artists are only paid for their travel costs, accommodation, breakfast, and 25 [[euro]]s of cash per day for their expenses. Their main income is derived from visitors' donations.&lt;ref name="Pflasterspektakel" /&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="1587">'''Process Decision Program Chart''' (PDPC) is a technique designed to help prepare [[contingency plan]]s.  The emphasis of the PDPC is to identify the consequential impact of failure on activity plans, and create appropriate contingency plans to limit risks.  Process diagrams and planning tree diagrams are extended by a couple of levels when the PDPC is applied to the bottom level tasks on those diagrams.

==Methodology==
From the bottom level of some activity box, the PDPC adds levels for:
# identifying what can go wrong (failure mode or risks)
# consequences of that failure (effect or consequence)
# possible countermeasures (risk mitigation action plan)&lt;ref&gt;http://site.iugaza.edu.ps/aschokry/files/2010/02/7_Tools.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

==Similar techniques==
The PDPC is similar to the [[failure mode and effects analysis]] (FMEA) in that both identify risks, consequences of failure, and contingency actions.  The FMEA adds prioritized risk levels through rating relative risk for each potential failure point.

'''SS ''Cantabria''''' was a Spanish cargo ship which was sunk in a military action of the [[Spanish Civil War]], off the coast of [[Norfolk]] 12 miles ENE&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;pg 13 The Ship-wrecks off North Norfolk. Ayer Tikus Publications&lt;/ref&gt; of [[Cromer]] on 2 November 1938.&lt;ref&gt;"Henry Blogg, the Greatest of the Lifeboatmen", Jolly, C., Pub: Poppyland Publishing, new edition 2002, {{ISBN|0-946148-59-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; The ship was shelled by the Spanish Nationalist [[auxiliary cruiser]] ''Nadir'', which was part of [[General Franco]]'s navy.

==Construction and early career==
SS ''Cantabria'' (5649 tons) was built in 1919 as ''War Chief'' at the shipyards of J. Coughlan &amp; Sons, [[Vancouver|Vancouver, British Columbia]], [[Canada]].&lt;ref&gt;"Henry Blogg, the Greatest of the Lifeboatmen", Jolly, C., Pub: Poppyland Publishing, new edition 2002, {{ISBN|0-946148-59-7}}, page 158&lt;/ref&gt; She was purchased by A.F. Pérez of Santander in 1919 and renamed ''Alfonso Pérez''. She was used as a [[prison ship]] during the [[Asturian miners' strike of 1934]].&lt;ref name=prison&gt;[http://elcuevanodelpasiego.wordpress.com/2011/04/23/historia-del-barco/ Historia de “el barco”] El Cuévano del Pasiego&lt;/ref&gt; In 1937 she was requisitioned by the ''Departamento de Navegación'' of Santander for the Republican government and renamed ''Cantabria''.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt; She was registered at the [[Bay of Biscay]] port of [[Santander, Cantabria|Santander]] in northern Spain, where she was used again as a [[prison ship]] by Republican authorities.&lt;ref name=prison/&gt;

==1938 incident==

At the time of the 1938 incident, ''Cantabria'' was under charter to a British company called the Mid-Atlantic Shipping Company based in London. ''Cantabria'' was not engaged in Spanish trade at the time of her sinking. She was on passage in ballast between the [[River Thames]] and [[Immingham]] bound for [[Leningrad]] under Captain Manuel Argüelles. On board were 45 people made up of crew and passengers, of which five were children and three women. One of the children was only three years old. The passengers included Argüelles' wife Trinidad, their son Ramon, aged six and their daughter Begoña, aged eight.

===Raider ''Nadir''===
''Nadir'' was a 1,132-ton [[armed merchantman|auxiliary cruiser]] of [[General Franco]]'s Spanish Nationalist forces armed with a {{convert|120|mm|in|abbr=on}} main gun, two {{convert|105|mm|in|abbr=on|0}} guns and other two {{convert|47|mm|in|abbr=on|0}} anti-aircraft guns. She was actually ''Ciudad de Valencia'', a warship very active during the blockade of Biscay in 1937. The Nationalists had renamed her in order to deceive the Republican navy about the real number of commerce raiders at sea. Her targets were Republican freighters operating from ports in northern Europe. The Nationalist raider had been launched on 18 October 1930 at the shipyard ''Unión Naval de Levante'' as ''Infante D. Gonzalo'', owned by the Transmediterránea company. She was requisitioned by the Nationalist government on 30 October 1936.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.trasmeships.es/52.html M/N ''Ciudad de Valencia''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20091226141430/http://www.trasmeships.es/52.html |date=26 December 2009 }} {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Shadowed===
[[File:The Wreck of the Cantabria.JPG|thumb|left|250px|Map showing the area of the incident]]
At around 11.30 am on 2 November, Argüelles was concerned that his freighter was being shadowed by a smaller ship. He had good reason to have concerns as the Spanish Nationalist navy had been given the use of the German port of [[Emden|Emdem]] by [[Hitler]], to act as base for them to raid Spanish shipping in the [[North Sea]] and the [[English Channel]] areas.&lt;ref name=":0"&gt;{{Cite book|title=La guerra civil española: Fuentes|last=Garcia Duran|first=Juan|publisher=Editorial Crítica|year=1985|isbn=9788474232660|location=|pages=331|language=Spanish}}&lt;/ref&gt;

With this situation in mind, the captain ordered his vessel to change course a degree or two to see if the following ship was following them. To Argüelles' concern, the vessel followed ''Cantabria''{{'}}s new course. His officers studied the following vessel with binoculars, but the vessel appeared to be of no threat and looked like an ordinary passenger steamer of around 1500 tons.

The vessel was in fact ''Nadir''. Captain Argüelles again changed course heading towards the Norfolk coast. ''Nadir'' followed and speeded up. The crew of ''Cantabria'' then saw that the flag of the Spanish insurgents had been raised on the mast of ''Nadir''. At the same time the raider's guns were unmasked and she ordered ''Cantabria'' to 'Heave to or I fire'. It was now the afternoon of 2 November when ''Nadir'' began to riddle the Republican freighter with gunfire.&lt;ref&gt;''[[The Times]]'', message from [[Reuters]] dated from [[Oslo]], 4 November 1938&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:MV-Ciudad de Valencia.jpg|thumb|250px|Spanish Nationalist auxiliary cruiser ''Nadir'' painted with [[Military camouflage|camouflage]] patterns]]
The action occurred on the high seas, outside British territorial waters, but near enough to the coast to be witnessed from the shore. ''Cantabria'', according to the statement of Argüelles himself, had refused to stop after having a shot fired high across her bows. At this point, nearby fishing boats intervened by heading towards ''Nadir'' sounding their [[Siren (noisemaker)|sirens]]. This had an effect as the attacking ship, although under no threat from the [[commercial trawler]]s, changed course and broke off its attack. The fishing boats, satisfied that they had broken up the confrontation, continued on their way. ''Nadir'', however, as soon as she was back in range, began to target the ship itself. A shell struck the bridge, destroying it. The raider circled ''Cantabria'' firing round after round and raking the ship with machine-gun fire. Another shell penetrated the engine room rendering ''Cantabria'' powerless. During this time the radio operator had been sending messages that the ship was 'being shelled by unknown vessel'. After the bridge had been destroyed and the engine room had been disabled he sent out the [[SOS]]. ''Cantabria''{{'}}s position was given as 8½ miles south-east of [[Haisborough Sands|Haisbro]] Light ship.&lt;ref&gt;"Henry Blogg, the Greatest of the Lifeboatmen", Jolly, C., Pub: Poppyland Publishing, new edition 2002, page 161, par 5, {{ISBN|0-946148-59-7}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rescue===
It was now nearly dark and at 5pm the [[Cromer Lifeboat Station|Cromer]] Lifeboat ''[[Cromer Lifeboat H F Bailey III|H.F. Bailey]]'' with coxswain [[Henry Blogg]] at the helm was launched to rescue ''Cantabria''{{'}}s crew and passengers. Before the lifeboat arrived fire had spread through the ship. Two boats were lowered and some of the crew and passengers abandoned the ship. Captain Argüelles, his wife and children and the second steward, Joaquin Vallego, remained aboard ''Cantabria'' fearing what their fate would be if they surrendering to the insurgents aboard ''Nadir''. With the boats now lowered, ''Nadir'' ceased fire. The attack was witnessed by two freighters, the British ''Monkwood'' and a [[Norwegians|Norwegian]] merchant, which gave up any rescue attempt, fearing the reaction of ''Nadir'', which was still in international waters.&lt;ref name="Cant"&gt;[http://www.sbhac.net/Republica/Colabora/Cantabria/Cantabria.htm ''El último viaje del Cantabria'', by María del Mar Argüelles] {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Monkwood'' later sent a report to the naval authorities, who dispatched some naval units to the spot to assure that no hostile action would be taken inside British territorial waters.&lt;ref&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/commons/1938/nov/03/spanish-ship-attack-north-sea#S5CV0340P0_19381103_HOC_277 Parliamentary debate, 3 November 1938]&lt;/ref&gt; Another British Merchant Vessel, ''Pattersonian'', appeared on the horizon, responding to the [[SOS]] sent from ''Cantabria''.&lt;ref&gt;Heaton, Paul Michael: ''Welsh Blockade Runners in the Spanish Civil War''. Starling Press, 1985. Page 96. {{ISBN|0-9507714-5-7}}&lt;/ref&gt; Captain Blackmore of ''Pattersonian'' had seen ''Nadir'' heading towards the lifeboat and had steered his ship across the attacking ship, getting his vessel between ''Nadir'' and the lifeboat. Eleven of the crew were taken off ''Cantabria'''s lifeboats by ''Pattersonian''. A further 20 of the crew in the second lifeboat were captured by ''Nadir''. This act was judged an unlawful interference with British shipping in the [[House of Lords]], since ''Nadir'' obstructed the legal duty of rescuing seamen.&lt;ref name=hansard/&gt; It was now dark and no more shots were being fired. The [[Cromer]] lifeboat arrived at the scene of the incident at 6.30 pm. A relieved Argüelles signaled the lifeboat with a torch and it pulled along the starboard side of ''Cantabria'', which was heavily listing. A line was thrown and the children and the captain's wife were handed down to the lifeboat and were soon followed by the steward and the Captain. When the rescue was completed, ''Cantabria'' suddenly heeled over damaging the lifeboat's stanchions. With great haste the lifeboat moved away from the sinking ''Cantabria''. Soon after the Republican steamer sank. At least one sailor, Juan Gil, was lost with the vessel.&lt;ref name=Cant/&gt; Other sources report the loss of four crewmembers.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://mundosgm.com/guerra-civil-espanola/corsarios-en-la-guerra-civil-espanola/|title=Corsarios en la Guerra Civil Española. {{!}} Todo sobre la Segunda Guerra Mundial|last=|first=|date=|website=mundosgm.com|language=Spanish|access-date=2016-04-27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Aftermath==
''H. F. Bailey'' returned to [[Cromer]] arriving at 8.15pm. Captain Argüelles, his family and the steward were taken to the Red Lion Hotel. Meanwhile, the other 11 rescued crewmen were taken to [[Great Yarmouth]] by ''Pattersonian''. An account of the incident was reported on the [[BBC]] along with a warning to shipping, giving the sunken ''Cantabria''{{'}}s position. The national press carried the story as their headlines but many of the crew at Yarmouth refused to be photographed fearing reprisals from [[Francisco Franco|Franco]]. Questions were also asked in the Houses of Parliament about the incident.&lt;ref name="hansard"&gt;[http://hansard.millbanksystems.com/lords/1938/nov/15/rule-of-law-on-the-high-seas/ 15 November 1938 : Lords Sitting : Rule of Law on the High Seas]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Gestapo involvement==
Two weeks after the sinking of SS ''Cantabria'', Danish police released information that shed new light on the recent confrontation that proved that it had been no coincidence that ''Nadir'' had intercepted ''Cantabria''.&lt;ref&gt;''Armies of Spies'', Author: Joseph Collomb, Published in 1939 by Macmillan, New York. Chapter 5, Franco's Fifth Column, page 88&lt;/ref&gt; For some time, the Danish police had been quietly interested in the [[Copenhagen]] [[correspondent]]s for a German newspaper. One of these correspondents was [[Horst Pflug-Hartnung|Horst von Pflug-Hartnung]]. He worked for the paper, ''Berliner Börsen Zeitung'', which was an organ of the [[Reich]] War Ministry.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;Armies of Spies, Author: Joseph Collomb, Published in 1939 by Macmillan, New York. Chapter 5, Franco's Fifth Column, page 89&lt;/ref&gt; The police arrested Hartnung along with eight other Germans living in [[Denmark]], along with three Danes and charged them of operating as spies in [[Copenhagen]]. During their investigations the Danish police proved that the accused had all been trained at [[Gestapo]] spy schools and had operated secret broadcasting stations, as well as engaging in [[nautical]] and [[Hydrography|hydrographical]] research. Between them they had drawn up maps and charts, graphs and complex mathematical tables of data. They communicated by complex code systems, which they changed frequently. The outlay for so extensive an apparatus as theirs could be justified only as part of [[Third Reich]] preparation for war against major countries. The spy ring just so happened to use the shadowing and sinking of Spanish Republican freighter SS ''Cantabria'' as a practical demonstration of their complicated subversion mechanism that the [[Gestapo]] was honing. The sinking had been formulated on behalf of Franco, backed by his allies, as a warning to Britain. Franco was serving notice on British government that, unless she proved reasonable in the current flux of world events, this was a warning of threats to come. Thanks to the investigations of the Danish police, it had been established that the attack had been planned by a more sinister power than General Francisco Franco, and one that was in a better position to threaten, namely [[Nazi]] Germany.&lt;ref name=autogenerated2 /&gt; In effect, ''Nadir'' and her sister ship ''Ciudad de Alicante'' used the German port of Emdem as a resupply base.&lt;ref name=":0" /&gt; 

===Horst von Pflugk-Hartnung===
[[Horst von Pflugk-Hartung]] was a German spy, who along with his brother Georg, had previously been charged in Berlin for the assassination of the Socialist leaders, [[Karl Liebknecht]] and [[Rosa Luxemburg]]. Both men were acquitted but evidently many thought them guilty, for the brother was assassinated himself sometime later. After Horst von Pflugk-Hartung's trial in Denmark,&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cix.co.uk/~jplant/revhist/supplem/trolle.htm Mike Jones on Danish Trotskyism, especially Trolle&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; he was only sentenced to a year and a half in prison and was released after a few months owing to German government pressure. He became one of the leading German Intelligence chiefs in Denmark.

==2006 tribute==
Captain Manuel Argüelles and his wife Trinidad eventually emigrated with their children to [[Mexico]] to make a new life for themselves and their family. In 2006, when the new [[Cromer#Tourism and the town today|Henry Blogg lifeboat museum]] was opened, Ramón Argüelles along with his sister Begoña made a visit to pay tribute to Henry Blogg and his crew.

[[Image:Saltonseadrainagemap.jpg|thumb|Map of the Salton Sea drainage area]]

The '''Salton Sea''' is a shallow, [[Salt lake|saline]], [[Endorheic basin|endorheic]] [[rift lake]] located directly on the [[San Andreas Fault]], predominantly in the [[U.S. state]] of [[California]]'s [[Imperial Valley|Imperial]] and [[Coachella Valley|Coachella]] valleys.

The lake occupies the lowest elevations of the [[Salton Sink]] in the [[Colorado Desert]] of Imperial and [[Riverside County, California|Riverside]] counties in [[Southern California]]. Its surface is {{convert|236.0|ft|abbr=on}} [[List of places on land with elevations below sea level|below sea level]] as of January 2018.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://waterdata.usgs.gov/ca/nwis/uv?site_no=10254005 |title=USGS 10254005 Salton Sea NR Westmorland CA |author=&lt;!--Staff writer(s); no by-line.--&gt; |date= |website=waterdata.usgs.gov |publisher= |access-date= |quote=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The deepest point of the sea is {{convert|5|ft|abbr=on}} higher than the lowest point of [[Death Valley]]. The sea is fed by the [[New River (Mexico – United States)|New]], [[Whitewater River (California)|Whitewater]], and [[Alamo River]]s, as well as agricultural [[Surface runoff|runoff]], drainage systems, and creeks.

Over millions of years, the [[Colorado River]] has flowed into the Imperial Valley and deposited soil (creating fertile farmland), building up the terrain and constantly changing the course of the river. For thousands of years, the river has flowed into and out of the valley alternately, creating a freshwater lake, an increasingly saline lake, and a dry desert basin, depending on river flows and the balance between inflow and evaporative loss. The cycle of filling has been about every 400–500 years and has repeated itself many times. The latest natural cycle occurred around 1600–1700 as remembered by Native Americans who talked with the first European settlers. Fish traps still exist at many locations, and the Native Americans evidently moved the traps depending upon the cycle.

The most recent inflow of water from the now heavily controlled Colorado River was accidentally created by the engineers of the [[California Development Company]] in 1905. In an effort to increase water flow into the area for farming, irrigation canals were dug from the Colorado River into the valley. The canals suffered silt buildup, so a cut was made in the bank of the Colorado River to further increase the water flow. The resulting outflow overwhelmed the engineered canal, and the river flowed into the Salton Basin for two years, filling the historic dry lake bed and creating the modern sea, before repairs were completed.&lt;ref name="cagov"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.water.ca.gov/saltonsea/documents/history.cfm |title=Salton Sea, History}}&lt;/ref&gt;

While it varies in dimensions and area with fluctuations in agricultural runoff and rainfall, the Salton Sea is about {{convert|15|by|35|mi}}. With an estimated surface area of {{convert|343|sqmi}} or {{convert|350|sqmi}}, the Salton Sea is the [[List of lakes in California|largest lake in California]].&lt;ref name="restorationreport_ch01"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/saltnsea/finalreport/Vol1/Chp1.pdf |title=Restoration of the Salton Sea Final Report December 2007 – Chapter 1.

However, due to changes in water apportionments agreed upon for the Colorado River under the [[Quantification Settlement Agreement]] of 2003, the overall water level of the sea is expected to decrease significantly between 2013 and 2021.&lt;ref name="QSA"&gt;{{cite web|author=San Diego County Water Authority|title=Quantification Settlement Agreement|url=http://www.sdcwa.org/quantification-settlement-agreement|publisher=San Diego County Water Authority|date=2014|accessdate=2014-10-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lake's [[salinity]], about {{Convert|56|g/l}}, is greater than that of the waters of the [[Pacific Ocean]] ({{Convert|35|g/l|abbr = on}}), but less than that of the [[Great Salt Lake]] (which ranges from {{Convert|50|to|270|g/l|abbr = on}}). Recently, the concentration has been increasing at a rate of about 3% per year.&lt;ref&gt;See http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/programs/SaltonSea_2004-2014.xlsx, linked at https://www2.usgs.gov/saltonsea/monitoring.html&lt;/ref&gt; About {{convert|4000000|ST|kg}} of salt are deposited in the valley each year.&lt;ref name=KhaledBali&gt;{{cite web

==History==
The area was once part of a vast inland sea that covered a large area of Southern California. Geologists estimate that for three million years, at least through all the years of the [[Pleistocene]] glacial age, a large delta was deposited by the Colorado River in the southern region of the Imperial Valley. Eventually, the delta reached the western shore of the [[Gulf of California]], creating a barrier that separated the area of the Salton Sea from the northern reaches of the Gulf. Were it not for this barrier, the entire Salton Sink along with the Imperial Valley would be submerged as the Gulf would extend as far north as [[Indio, California|Indio]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Alles|first=DL|url=http://fire.biol.wwu.edu/trent/alles/GeologySaltonTrough.pdf|title=Geology of the Salton Trough|publisher=Western Washington University|work=Biology Department|date=2007-08-06|accessdate=2010-06-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Since the exclusion of the ocean, the Salton Basin has over the ages been alternately a freshwater lake, an increasingly saline [[endorheic]] lake, and a dry desert basin, depending on river flows and the balance between inflow and evaporative loss. A lake exists only during times it is replenished by the rivers and rainfall, a cycle that has repeated itself many times over hundreds of thousands of years,&lt;ref name=EugeneSinger&gt;{{cite web|author=Singer E |title=Ancient Lake Cahuilla – Geology of the Imperial Valley |url=http://home.att.net/~amcimages/singer.html |accessdate=2009-07-10 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090601123522/http://home.att.net/~amcimages/singer.html |archivedate=June 1, 2009 }}&lt;/ref&gt; perhaps cycling every 400 to 500 years.&lt;ref name="laflin"/&gt;

Evidence that the basin was occupied periodically by multiple lakes includes wave-cut shorelines at various elevations preserved on the hillsides of the east and west margins of the present lake, the Salton Sea. These indicate that the basin was occupied intermittently as recently as a few hundred years ago. The last of the Pleistocene lakes to occupy the basin was [[Lake Cahuilla]], also periodically identified on older maps as Lake LeConte or the Blake Sea, after American professor and geologist [[William Phipps Blake]].

Throughout the Spanish period of California's history, the area was referred to as the "[[Colorado Desert]]" after the Colorado River. In a railroad survey completed in 1855, it was called "the Valley of the Ancient Lake". On several old maps from the [[Library of Congress]], it has been found labeled "Cahuilla Valley" (after the local Native American tribe) and "Cabazon Valley" (after a local Native American chief – Chief Cabazon). "[[Salt Creek (Salton Sea)|Salt Creek]]" first appeared on a map in 1867 and "Salton Station" is on a railroad map from 1900, although this place had been there as a rail stop since the late 1870s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://saltonsea.ca.gov/pdfs/hydrology/19610000_carpelan.pdf|title=Carpelan, Lars H.

===History during the 1900s===
[[File:Colorado River below Imperial Canal intake.jpg|thumb|left|Original caption: ''Dry Bed of Colorado River Below Imperial Intake [...] River Diverted Into [[Alamo Canal|Imperial Canal]]'']]
In 1900, the California Development Company began construction of irrigation canals to divert water from the Colorado River into the Salton Sink, a dry lake bed. After construction of these irrigation canals, the Salton Sink became fertile for a time, allowing farmers to plant crops.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.sci.sdsu.edu/salton/PeriscopeSaltonSeaCh1-4.html |title=The Salton Sea:  California's Overlooked Treasure, Chapter 4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Within two years, the [[Imperial Canal]] became filled with silt from the Colorado River. Engineers tried to alleviate the blockages to no avail. In 1905, heavy rainfall and snowmelt caused the Colorado River to swell, overrunning a set of headgates for the [[Alamo Canal]]. The resulting flood poured down the canal, breached an Imperial Valley [[dike (construction)|dike]], and ran down two former dry [[arroyo (creek)|arroyos]]: the New River in the west, and the Alamo River in the east, each about {{convert|60|mi|km|abbr=on}} long.&lt;ref&gt;Detailed maps, and a film of the breach (and subsequent redamming) are in ''[[Plagues &amp; Pleasures on the Salton Sea]]'', a 2006 documentary&lt;/ref&gt; Over about two years, these two newly created rivers sporadically carried the entire volume of the Colorado River into the Salton Sink.&lt;ref name="laflin"&gt;{{cite web |author=Pat Laflin |title=The Salton Sea: California's Overlooked Treasure |pages=21–26 |url=http://www.spatial.redlands.edu/salton/Downloads/Docs/CulturalHistory/cal_orverlooked_treasure_lafin.pdf|publisher=Coachella Valley Historical Society |date=29 July 2003 |accessdate=11 February 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[Southern Pacific Railroad]] tried to stop the flooding by dumping earth into the canal's headgates area, but the effort was not fast enough, and the river eroded deeper and deeper into the dry desert sand of the Imperial Valley. A large waterfall formed as a result and began cutting rapidly upstream along the path of the Alamo Canal that now was occupied by the Colorado. This waterfall was initially {{convert|15|ft}} high, but grew to {{convert|80|ft}} high before the flow through the breach was stopped. Originally, it was feared that the waterfall would recede upstream to the true main path of the Colorado, becoming up to {{convert|100|to|300|ft}} high, at which point it would be practically impossible to fix the problem.

[[File:North shore of the Salton Sea.JPG|thumb|Salton Sea]]
As the basin filled, the town of Salton, a Southern Pacific Railroad siding, and [[Torres-Martinez Desert Cahuilla Indians|Torres-Martinez]] Native American land were submerged. The sudden influx of water and the lack of any drainage from the basin resulted in the formation of the Salton Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=The Salton Sea: An Account of Harriman's Fight With The Colorado River|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=uw64AAAAIAAJ|last=Kennan|first=G|year=1917|publisher=The MacMillan Company|location=New York|isbn=|pages=|accessdate=2009-07-11}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Larkin|first=EL|year=1907|title=A Thousand Men Against A River: The Engineering Victory Over The Colorado River And The Salton Sea|journal=[[World's Work|The World's Work: A History of Our Time]]|volume=XIII|issue=|pages=8606–10|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=3IfNAAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA8606|accessdate=2009-07-10}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The U.S. Navy conducted a preliminary inspection of the Salton Sea in January 1940, and the Salton Sea Test Base (SSTB, run by Sandia Labs) was initially commissioned as the [[Salton Sea Naval Auxiliary Air Station]], in October 1942. The SSTB, just to the southeast of [[Salton City, California|Salton City]], originally functioned as an operational and training base for seaplanes. Additional activities at the base included experimental testing of solid-fuel plane-launched rockets, jet-assist take-off testing, aeroballistic testing of inert atomic weapon test units at land and marine target areas, training bombing at marine targets, testing of the effects of long-term storage on atomic weapons, testing of the Project Mercury space capsule parachute landing systems, parachute training and testing, and military training exercises. The base was abandoned in 1978.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://nrm.dfg.ca.gov/FileHandler.ashx?DocumentID=9429 |title=Salton Sea Test Base Site Inspection Report – sect2-1, 1995}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The continuing intermittent flooding of the Imperial Valley from the Colorado River led to the idea of the need for a dam on the Colorado River for flood control.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

===Subsequent evolution===
[[File:Mud volcano Salton Sea.jpg|thumb|upright|A gaseous [[mud volcano]]]]

The Salton Sea had some success as a resort area, with Salton City, [[Salton Sea Beach, California|Salton Sea Beach]], and [[Desert Shores, California|Desert Shores]], on the western shore and [[Desert Beach, California|Desert Beach]], [[North Shore, California|North Shore]], and [[Bombay Beach, California|Bombay Beach]], built on the eastern shore in the 1950s. However, many of the settlements substantially shrank in size, or have been abandoned, mostly due to the increasing salinity and pollution of the lake over the years from agricultural runoff and other sources. Many of the species of fish that lived in the sea have been killed off by the combination of pollutants, salt levels, and [[algal bloom]]s. Dead fish have been known to wash up in mass quantities on the beaches. The smell of the lake, combined with the stench of the decaying fish, also contributed to the decline of the tourist industry around the Salton Sea. Many people now visit the Salton Sea and the surrounding settlements to explore the abandoned structures. The town of [[Niland, California|Niland]] is {{Convert|1.5|mi}} southeast of the sea, with a population of 1,006. Evidence of [[Geothermal (geology)|geothermal]] activity is also visible. [[Mudpot]]s and [[mud volcano]]es are found on the eastern side of the Salton Sea.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|doi=10.1785/0120070252|last1=Lynch|first1=DK|last2=Hudnut|first2=KW|year=2008|title=The Wister Mud Pot Lineament: Southeastward Extension or Abandoned Strand of the San Andreas Fault?|journal=Bulletin of the Seismological Society of America|volume=98|issue=4|pages=1720–29|bibcode=2008BuSSA..98.1720L}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Salton Sea geothermal energy|A number of geothermal electricity generation plants]] are located along the southeastern shore of the Salton Sea in Imperial County.

The US Geological Survey describes the smell as "objectionable", "noxious", "unique", and "pervasive".&lt;ref&gt;https://www2.usgs.gov/saltonsea/saltonWorkshops/eutrofin.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

===Fish population===
Due to the high salinity, very few fish species can tolerate living in the Salton Sea. Introduced [[tilapia]] are the main fish that can tolerate the high salinity levels and pollution. Other freshwater fish species live in the rivers and canals that feed the Salton Sea, including [[threadfin shad]], [[carp]], [[red shiner]], [[channel catfish]], [[Ictalurus catus|white catfish]], [[largemouth bass]], [[mosquitofish]], [[sailfin molly]], and the vulnerable [[desert pupfish]].&lt;ref name=sonnybono&gt;{{cite journal |author=U.S. Fish &amp; Wildlife Service |year=2008 |title=Sonny Bono Salton Sea National Wildlife Refuge: Wildlife List |url=http://www.fws.gov/saltonsea/pdf/SaltonSeaWildlifeList%2708.6.pdf |format=[[Portable Document Format|PDF]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

The [[California Office of Environmental Health Hazard Assessment]]  has developed a safe eating advisory for fish caught in the Salton Sea based on levels of mercury or [[Polychlorinated biphenyl|PCBs]] found in local species.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://oehha.ca.gov/fish/advisories/salton-sea|title=Salton Sea|last=Admin|first=OEHHA|date=2014-12-30|work=OEHHA|access-date=2018-06-13|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Avian population===
The Salton Sea has been termed a "crown jewel of avian biodiversity" by Dr. Milt Friend of the Salton Sea Science Office. Over 400 species have been documented at the Salton Sea. The most diverse and probably the most significant populations of bird life in the continental United States are hosted, rivaled only by [[Big Bend National Park]] in [[Texas]].&lt;ref&gt;Morrison, Patt (September 17, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/opinion/op-ed/la-oe-0918-morrison-salton-sea-krantz-20140918-column.html "A persuasive case for saving the Salton Sea, California's biggest lake"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]'' Interview with Tim Krantz&lt;/ref&gt; It supports 30% of the remaining population of the [[American white pelican]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://ca.audubon.org/Salton_Sea_Avifauna.pdf|title=ca.audubon.org|publisher=|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20060113103725/http://ca.audubon.org/Salton_Sea_Avifauna.pdf|archivedate=2006-01-13|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Salton Sea is also a major resting stop on the [[Pacific Flyway]]. On 18 November 2006, a [[Ross's gull]], a high Arctic bird, was sighted and photographed there.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.southwestbirders.com/rogu_ss111806.htm|title=Ross's Gull – 2006|website=www.southwestbirders.com|access-date=2017-12-12}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Increasing salinity==
[[File:Dead Fishes on the shores of Salton City.jpg|thumb|left|upright|Dead fish on the western shore of [[Salton City, California|Salton City]]]]
The lack of an outflow means the Salton Sea does not have a natural stabilization system; it is very dynamic. Fluctuations in the water level caused by variations in agricultural runoff, the ancient salt deposits in the lake bed, and the relatively high salinity of the inflow feeding the sea are all causing increasing salinity. The body was initially a freshwater lake, but by the 1960s, its rising salinity had begun to jeopardize some of its species. With a salinity now exceeding 5.0% [[Mass concentration (chemistry)|w/v]] (saltier than seawater), most species of fish can no longer survive. A freshwater fish notable for its ability to withstand the rising salinity of the Salton Sea, the [[desert pupfish]], can survive salinities ranging from 0.0% to 7.0%.&lt;ref name=drecp1&gt;Dudek and ICF International (2012). Desert Renewable Energy Conservation Plan (DRECP) Baseline Biology Report. (Draft). Prepared for the California Energy Commission.&lt;/ref&gt; Fertilizer runoffs have resulted in [[eutrophication]], with large [[algal bloom]]s and elevated bacterial levels.&lt;ref name="nasa"&gt;[[NASA]] page: "[http://visibleearth.nasa.gov/view.php?id=69143 Algal bloom in the Salton Sea, California]".&lt;/ref&gt;

By 2014, large swaths of lake bed were exposed and salt levels drastically increased due to mandated water transfers to metropolitan areas along the coast and other factors, limiting the water inflow. Besides the resulting fish kills, the shrinking lake interrupts the bird migration, causes dust clouds, and negatively impacts local tourism.&lt;ref&gt;Rañoa, Raoul (October 21, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-g-drought-drawdowns-and-death-of-the-salton-sea-20141021-htmlstory.html "'Drought, drawdowns and death of the Salton Sea"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt;

Alternatives for "saving" the Salton Sea have been evaluated since 1955.{{citation needed|date=November 2014}}

[[File:Nrborderborderentrythreecolorsmay05-1-.JPG|thumb|left|The [[New River (Mexico – United States)|New River]] passes from [[Mexicali]], Baja California, to the [[Imperial Valley]], and on to the Salton Sea.]]
Much of the current interest in the sea was sparked in the 1990s by Congressman [[Sonny Bono]].&lt;ref name="bonocnn"&gt;[[CNN]] article: "[http://www.cnn.com/EARTH/9801/16/salton.sea/index.html Salton Sea rescue to be named for Sonny Bono]".&lt;/ref&gt; His widow, [[Mary Bono|Mary Bono Mack]], elected to fill his seat, has continued to be interested in the Salton Sea, as has [[Jerry Lewis (California politician)|Representative Jerry Lewis]] of [[Redlands, California|Redlands]].&lt;ref name="bonocnn"/&gt; In 1998, the Sonny Bono Salton Sea Restoration Project was named for the politician.&lt;ref name="bonocnn"/&gt;

In the late 1990s, the [[Salton Sea Authority]], a local joint powers agency, and the US [[Bureau of Reclamation]] began efforts to evaluate and develop an alternative to save the Salton Sea. A draft [[Environmental Impact Report]]/[[Environmental Impact Statement]], which did not specify a preferred alternative, was released for public review in 2000. Since that time, the Salton Sea Authority has developed a preferred concept&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.saltonsea.ca.gov/|title=phpinfo()|website=www.saltonsea.ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{full citation needed|date=November 2012}} that involves the construction of a large dam that would impound water to create a marine sea in the northern and southern parts of the sea and along the western edge.{{citation needed|date=August 2012}}

[[File:Salton Sea from Space.jpg|thumb|upright|Satellite image of the Salton Sea with surrounding developments]]
Many other concepts have been proposed,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.usbr.gov/lc/region/saltnsea/ssbro.html#steps|title=US Bureau of Reclamation - Salton Sea Project Office - Salton Sea Brochure - 1999|website=www.usbr.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; including piping water from the sea to a wetland in Mexico, [[Laguna Salada (Baja California)|Laguna Salada]], as a means of salt export, and one by Aqua Genesis Ltd to bring in seawater from the Gulf of California, desalinate it at the sea using available geothermal heat, and sell the water to pay for the plan. This concept would involve the construction of over {{Convert|20|mi}} of pipes and tunneling, and, with the increasing demand for water at the coastline, would provide an additional {{convert|1,000,000|acre.ft|km3|lk=in}} of water to Southern California coastal cities each year.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sandiegoreader.com/news/2004/feb/26/inventor-tackles-salton-sea-disaster/ sandiegoreader.com]; San Diego Union Times: Ronald Newcomb's Salton Sea proposal&lt;/ref&gt;

====State restoration plan====
[[Image:Salton Sea homes.JPG|thumb|left|Abandoned, salt-encrusted structures on the Salton Sea shore at [[Bombay Beach, California|Bombay Beach]]]]

In 2003, the [[Imperial Irrigation District]] agreed to sell a portion of its allotment from the Colorado River for 45 years to the [[San Diego County Water Authority]].&lt;ref name=inaction&gt;Perry, Tony (September 3, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/local/lanow/la-me-ln-salton-sea-warning-report-20140903-story.html "'Salton Sea inaction could cause 'catastrophic change,' report says"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The [[California State Legislature]], by legislation enacted in 2003 and 2004, directed the Secretary of the [[California Resources Agency]] to prepare a restoration plan for the Salton Sea [[ecosystem]], and an accompanying Environmental Impact Report.&lt;ref name=sserp&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.water.ca.gov/saltonsea/|title=Salton Sea Unit|first=State of|last=California|website=www.water.ca.gov}}&lt;/ref&gt; As part of this effort, the Secretary for Resources has established an advisory committee to provide recommendations to assist in the preparation of the Ecosystem Restoration Plan, including consultation throughout all stages of the alternative selection. The [[California Department of Water Resources]] and [[California Department of Fish and Game]] are leading the effort to develop a preferred alternative for the restoration of the Salton Sea ecosystem and the protection of wildlife dependent on that ecosystem.

On January 24, 2008, the California Legislative Analyst's Office released a report titled "Restoring the Salton Sea."&lt;ref name=sserp/&gt; The preferred alternative outlined in the draft plan calls for spending almost $9 billion over 25 years and proposes a smaller but more manageable Salton Sea. The amount of water available for use by humans and wildlife would be reduced by 60% from {{Convert|365|sqmi}} to about {{Convert|147|sqmi}}. About {{Convert|52|mi}} of barrier and perimeter dikes—constructed most likely out of boulders, gravel, and stone columns—would be erected, along with earthen berms to corral the water into a horseshoe shape along the northern shoreline of the sea from San Felipe Creek on the west shore to Bombay Beach on the east shore. The central portion of the sea would be allowed to evaporate almost completely and would serve as a brine sink, while the southern portion of the sea would be constructed into a saline habitat complex. Construction on the project would be completed by 2035.

[[File:Salty Salton Sea Beach.jpg|thumb|Salt deposits along the eastern shore of the sea]]

The sale of the Imperial water to San Diego County resulted in a reduction in agricultural runoff needed to replenish the sea. During the first 15 years, the irrigation district has been required to put water into the Salton Sea to compensate for the loss of runoff. Since the requirement expired in 2017, the district sent a letter to the [[California State Water Resources Control Board]] in 2014 asking that the board sponsor negotiations to get the state to fulfill its obligation to stop the deterioration of the sea. [[Pacific Institute]], an [[Oakland, California|Oakland]]-based environmental [[think tank]], was warning that the lack of replenishment water was leading to a "period of very rapid deterioration."&lt;ref name=Looming&gt;Perry, Tony (November 21, 2014) [http://www.latimes.com/local/california/la-me-salton-sea-20141122-story.html "'Looming environmental crisis' at Salton Sea prompts plea for help"] ''[[Los Angeles Times]]''&lt;/ref&gt; The rapidly shrinking sea was a "looming environmental and public health crisis"&lt;ref name=inaction/&gt; With the increased shrinkage, dust storms would increase and a rotten-egg smell could reach to the coastal cities.&lt;ref name="Looming"/&gt;

In 2018, California's Natural Resources Agency received 11 proposals to increase waterflow to the sea in order to reduce dust and dust-borne toxins. Proposal costs ranged from $300 million to several billion dollars. No winner was selected in this phase.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.desertsun.com/story/news/politics/2018/04/16/ten-questions-eleven-proposals-save-salton-sea/516602002/|title=10 questions about the 11 proposals to save the Salton Sea|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Earthquake geology==
The Salton Sea and surrounding basin sits over the [[San Andreas Fault]], [[San Jacinto Fault]], [[Imperial Fault Zone]], and a "stepover fault" [[shear zone]] system. Geologists{{who|date=May 2018}} have determined that previous flooding episodes from the Colorado River have been linked to earthquakes along the San Andreas Fault. [[Sonar]] and other instruments were used to map the Salton Sea's underwater faults during the study. During the period when the basin was filled by Lake Cahuilla, a much larger inland sea, earthquakes higher than magnitude 7 occurred roughly every 180 years, the last one occurring within decades of 1700. Computer models suggest the [[normal fault]]s in the area are most vulnerable to [[deviatoric stress]] loading by filling in of water. Currently, a risk still exists for an earthquake of magnitude 7 to 8. Simulations also showed, in the Los Angeles area, shaking and thus damage would be more severe for a San Andreas earthquake that propagated along the fault from the south, rather than from the north. Such an earthquake also raises the risk for [[soil liquefaction]] in the Imperial Valley region.&lt;ref&gt;Brothers, Daniel, et al. "Loading of the San Andreas fault by flood-induced rupture of faults beneath the Salton Sea." Nature Geoscience 4.7 (2011): 486–492.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Ross|first=JE|title=Flooding of Ancient Salton Sea Linked to San Andreas Earthquakes|url=http://scrippsnews.ucsd.edu/Releases/?releaseID=1176|work=Scripps Institution of Oceanography, University of California at San Diego|publisher=Scripps Oceanography News|accessdate=31 July 2011|date=July 27, 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The effective [[drainage divide]] that separates the Salton Sea from the Gulf of California is about {{convert|9|m|abbr=on}} in elevation and is located near Delta, northeastern Baja California State, Mexico, south-southeast of [[Mexicali]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Tingle|first=A|title=Flood Maps|url=http://flood.firetree.net/?ll=32.5283,-114.7357&amp;z=9&amp;m=9|work=Firetree.net|publisher=Flood|accessdate=31 July 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; Past [[sea level rise]] may partially be responsible for the [[salinity]] of the lake, while potential [[future sea level|future changes]] in sea levels could occur. However, other factors such as [[hydrothermal vent]]s, [[diffusion]] of salt from minerals and sediment, including concentrated [[brine]], and [[evaporite]]s are another contributor to salinity, as is the recent lowering of lake levels raising the salinity, though sedimentary records show the lake surface elevation reached levels 10–12 m above world sea level in the 1500s.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last=Wardlaw |first=GD |author2=Valentine DL |title=Evidence for salt diffusion from sediments contributing to increasing salinity in the Salton Sea, California |journal=Hydrobiologia |date=January 2005 |volume=533 |issue=1–3 |pages=77–85 |doi=10.1007/s10750-004-2395-8 |url=http://www.geol.ucsb.edu/faculty/valentine/Wardlaw%20and%20Valentine%202004%20Proof.PDF |accessdate=31 July 2011 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070416200711/http://www.geol.ucsb.edu/faculty/valentine/Wardlaw%20and%20Valentine%202004%20Proof.PDF |archivedate=April 16, 2007 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Image:Hieronymus Bosch 075.jpg|thumb|A detail from [[The Haywain Triptych]] by [[Hieronymus Bosch]]]]
A '''stabbing''' is [[penetrating trauma|penetration]] with a sharp or pointed object at close range. ''Stab'' connotes purposeful action, as by an [[Assassination|assassin]] or [[murder]]er, but it is also possible to accidentally stab oneself or others. Stabbing differs from [[Slashing (crime)|slashing]] or [[cutting]] in that the motion of the object used in a stabbing generally moves perpendicular to and directly into the victim's body, rather than being drawn across it.

Stabbings today are common among [[gangs]] and in [[prisons]] because knives are cheap, easy to acquire (or manufacture), easily concealable and relatively effective. In 2013 about 8 million stabbings occurred.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Global Burden of Disease Study 2013|first1=Collaborators|title=Global, regional, and national incidence, prevalence, and years lived with disability for 301 acute and chronic diseases and injuries in 188 countries, 1990-2013: a systematic analysis for the Global Burden of Disease Study 2013.|journal=Lancet|date=22 August 2015|volume=386|issue=9995|pages=743–800|pmid=26063472|doi=10.1016/s0140-6736(15)60692-4|pmc=4561509}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
[[File:Assassinato luigi.jpg|thumb|After being attacked and stabbed, empress [[Elisabeth of Bavaria|Elisabeth of Austria]] boarded a ship, unaware of the severity of her condition as consequence of an [[acute stress reaction]]. Bleeding to death from a puncture wound to the heart, Elisabeth's last words were, "What happened to me?"]]
Stabbings have been common throughout human history and were the means used to [[assassinate]] a number of distinguished historical figures, such as Second [[Caliph]] [[Umar]] and [[Roman emperor]]s [[Julius Caesar]] and [[Caligula]].

In Japan, the historical practice of stabbing oneself deliberately in [[ritual suicide]] is known as ''[[seppuku]]'' (more colloquially ''hara-kiri'', literally "belly-cutting" since it involves cutting open the abdomen). The ritual is highly codified, and the person committing suicide is assisted by a "second" who is entrusted to decapitate him cleanly (and thus expedite death and prevent an undignified spectacle) once he has made the abdominal wound.

==Mechanism==
The human [[skin]] has a somewhat elastic property as a self-defense; when the human body is stabbed by a thin object such as a small kitchen knife, the skin often closes tightly around the object and closes again if the object is removed, which can trap some blood within the body. It has thus been speculated that the [[fuller (weapon)|fuller]], an elongated concave depression in a metal blade, functions to let blood out of the body in order to cause more damage. This misconception has led to fullers becoming widely known as "blood grooves". The fuller is actually a structural reinforcement of the blade similar in design to a metal I-beam used in construction. However, [[internal bleeding]] is just as dangerous as external bleeding; if enough blood vessels are severed to cause serious injury, the skin's elasticity will do nothing to prevent blood from exiting the circulatory system and accumulating uselessly in other parts of the body.

Death from stabbing is caused by [[Shock (circulatory)|shock]], severe [[blood loss]], infection, or loss of function of an essential organ such as the [[heart]] and/or [[lung]]s.

==Medical treatment==
{{further|Stab wound}}
Although previously a victim of abdominal stabbing would be subject to exploratory surgery [[laparotomy]], it is now considered safe not to operate if the patient is stable.  In that case, they should be observed for signs of decompensation indicating a serious injury.  In the event that the patient initially presents stabbing injuries and is unstable, laparotomy should be initiated to discover and rectify any internal injury.

==Autopsy examination==
When someone who has sustained a stab wound dies, the body is autopsied and the wound is inspected by a [[forensic pathologist]]. Such examination can yield valuable information about the weapon used to produce the injury. From the external appearance and internal findings, the pathologist will usually be able to offer opinion about the dimensions of the weapon including the width and minimum possible length of the blade. It is possible to determine whether the weapon was single edged or double edged.&lt;ref name=Biju&gt;{{cite journal|last=James|first=Biju|author2=Ajay Balachandran |author3=Anu Sasidharan |author4=Ramakrishanan U K |author5=Prem T N |author6=Thomas Jerry |title=Unusual Incised Stab Wound Produced by a Single Edged Weapon: A Case Report|journal=Indian Journal of Forensic Medicine and Toxicology|date=22 July 2013|volume=7|issue=2|pages=1–3|doi=10.5958/j.0973-9130|url=http://www.indianjournals.com/ijor.aspx?target=ijor:ijfmt&amp;volume=7&amp;issue=2&amp;article=001|accessdate=3 December 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Sometimes factors like the taper of the blade and movement of knife in the wound can also be determined. [[Bruise]]s or [[Abrasion (medical)|abrasions]] may give information about the [[Knife#Parts|guard]].&lt;ref name=Biju/&gt;

'''True Realm''' is a [[gaming convention]] showcasing the [[True Dungeon]] event which has been held previously and in conjunction with [[Gen Con]] game convention (from 2003 to present).

True Realm is a unique event in the gaming world. Open on only two days a year (April 3–4, 2009), the event is an indoor, 40,000 sq. ft. “theme park” for gamer geeks who want to immerse themselves in a world of medieval fantasy gaming.

The main attraction area is a 12,000 sq. ft. medieval fantasy city-scape where gamers can spend the day exploring True Realm and enjoying many immerse live-action events.  They can find the entrances to two HUGE Dungeons and Dragons type events with each being a two-hour adventure inside a vast walk-through D&amp;D dungeon. They can also find themselves joining an assault to re-take a tower that has been occupied by three challenging monsters — or they might decide to prove their worth to join the Rogues’ Guild by trying to steal a chalice from a temple.  There are even surprise events that can only be found by careful exploration.

And, of course, there is an Inn that offers food and drink (as well as a good place to pick up a tabletop game), a Tavern where more boisterous gamers can enjoy a beer or two while reliving their latest dungeon exploits, a Courtyard that features street performances, interactive experiences and several contests

An '''[[independence referendum]]''' was held in the [[Uzbekistan|Republic of Uzbekistan]] on 29 December 1991,&lt;ref&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen]], Florian Grotz &amp; Christof Hartmann (2001) ''Elections in Asia: A data handbook, Volume I'', p490 {{ISBN|0-19-924958-X}}&lt;/ref&gt; alongside [[Uzbekistani presidential election, 1991|presidential elections]]. The result was 98.3% of voters in favour, with a turnout of 94.1%.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen et al, p492&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
In a [[Soviet Union referendum, 1991|USSR-wide referendum]] held in March, 95% of voters in the [[Uzbek Soviet Socialist Republic|Uzbek SSR]] voted in favour of preserving the [[Soviet Union]] as "a renewed federation of equal sovereign republics in which the rights and freedom of an individual of any nationality will be fully guaranteed?". There was also a separate question asked only in the Uzbek SSR, with 95% of voters voting in favour of the proposal that the country "should remain part of a renewed Union (federation) as a sovereign republic with equal rights".&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=uz011991 Uzbekistan, 17 March 1991: Equal sovereign republic] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt;

However, following the [[1991 Soviet coup d'état attempt|attempted coup d'état]] in August, it was decided to seek independence.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.sudd.ch/event.php?lang=en&amp;id=uz021991 Uzkekistan, 29 December 1991: Independence] Direct Democracy {{de icon}}&lt;/ref&gt; Independence was subsequently declared on 31 August,&lt;ref&gt;B.V. Rao (200) ''History Of Modern Europe (1789-1992)'' Sterling Publishers, p337&lt;/ref&gt; and the Soviet Union ceased to exist on 26 December 1991,&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.nytimes.com/1991/12/26/world/end-of-the-soviet-union-the-soviet-state-born-of-a-dream-dies.html END OF THE SOVIET UNION; The Soviet State, Born of a Dream, Dies] The New York Times, 26 December 1991&lt;/ref&gt; three days before the referendum.
