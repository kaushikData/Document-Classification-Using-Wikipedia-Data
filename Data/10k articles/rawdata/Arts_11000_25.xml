'''Alice Johnson''' is a fictional character and a [[protagonist]] in the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)|''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' franchise]],  portrayed by [[Lisa Wilcox]]. She was created by [[William Kotzwinkle]] and Brian Helgeland. She appears as a main character in two of the nine ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' films, first appearing in [[Renny Harlin]]'s ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master]]'' (1988). In 1989, Alice returned in [[Stephen Hopkins (director)|Stephen Hopkins]]' ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child]]'' before going on to appear in the [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (comics)|comic book adaptions]], [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (franchise)#Novels|novels]], and ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'' (2003) through archive footage. In ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master|The Dream Master]]'', Alice has the ability to gain the "dream powers" of [[Freddy Krueger]]'s victims. In ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child|The Dream Child]]'', Freddy begins to use Alice's unborn son [[List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters#Jacob Daniel Johnson|Jacob]] as a way to return. In the original script for ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]'' (1991), Alice was set to return but this idea was eventually scrapped.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.buzzfeed.com/louispeitzman/the-25-fiercest-final-girls-of-horror|title=The 25 Fiercest Final Girls Of Horror|last=Peitzman|first=Louis|date=October 16, 2013|website=BuzzFeed|publisher=|access-date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Appearances ==

=== Film ===
In ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master]]'', Alice Johnson was the best friend of [[List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters#Kristen|Kristen Parker]]. Their friendship was further solidified due to Alice's brother [[List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters#Rick|Rick]] dating Kristen. Alice and Rick came from a broken family. Their mother had long passed away before the events of the film, and the grief and devastation likely turned their father Dennis into an alcoholic. Whereas Rick showed gregariousness to mask his emotional pain, Alice became timid and withdrawn—to the point that she covered her dresser mirror with pictures just so she would not have to see her reflection. She worked as a waitress and daydreamed constantly to escape from the real world. When Kristen accidentally pulls Alice into her dream, Kristen passes on her dream powers before being killed by [[Freddy Krueger]]. 

Alice became the "Dream Master" due to the combination of Kristen's powers and her own latent dreaming abilities (e.g., shortly before Freddy's final attack on Kristen, Alice appears in Kristen's dream as a child playing on a beach). Alice then became Freddy's next target because, by killing Kristen, he could no longer access new victims. Alice was Freddy's loophole, as he could kill anyone that she uncontrollably pulled into her dreams. Her link to Freddy allowed her to take on the abilities— both from the waking world and the dream world—of his victims. As Alice's friends and brother are picked off by Freddy, she grows much stronger and capable of fighting back through the abilities that she accumulates. Sensing that Freddy relied on his victim's souls, Alice manages to defeat him by giving all of his victims the power to escape Freddy's body and enter the positive dream gate.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://crypticrock.com/interview-lisa-wilcox-2/|title=Interview – Lisa Wilcox|last=|first=|date=|website=crypticrock.com|publisher=|access-date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child]]'', Alice suppressed her encounter with Freddy by starting a relationship with Dan Jordan (the other survivor from ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master|The Dream Master]]'') and making new friends. However, after becoming pregnant by Dan, Alice begins having nightmares about Freddy that reflect the horror surrounding his conception and birth. Alice's friends and Dan are soon murdered, and it is revealed that Freddy is planning to be reborn in the body of her unborn son [[List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters#A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child|Jacob Daniel Johnson]]. He is corrupting Jacob by feeding him the souls of the victims. Due to her pregnancy, Alice shares her "Dream Master" abilities with Jacob. There is a caveat, however, as Jacob is able to blur the boundary between the waking world and the dream world without Alice needing to be asleep. Thereby, just like his mother in the previous film, Jacob becomes a prime target for manipulation due to not having the right control over his abilities. When Alice is on the verge of losing her battle against Freddy, [[List of A Nightmare on Elm Street characters#Amanda|Sister Mary Helena (Amanda Krueger)]] urges Jacob to beat Freddy with the souls that were fed to him. Upon Freddy's demise, Alice gives birth to Jacob several months later.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.joblo.com/horror-movies/news/the-fckin-black-sheep-a-nightmare-on-elm-street-5-the-dream-child-1989-121|title=The F*ckin Black Sheep: A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child (1989)|last=|first=|date=|website=JoBlo Movie Network|publisher=|access-date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the original script for ''[[Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare]]'', Alice was set to return. She would have been killed by [[Freddy Krueger|Freddy]] early in the film, making Jacob the main protagonist.&lt;ref name="autogenerated1"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/site/films/freddys-dead-the-final-nightmare/freddys-dead-the-final-nightmare-scripts/ |title=Freddy's Dead: The Final Nightmare — Scripts &amp;#124; Nightmare on Elm Street Companion — Ultimate Online Resource to Horror Series A Nightmare on Elm Street |publisher=Nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com |date=1990-12-19 |accessdate=2012-11-18}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, this version of the script was scrapped and the actual film makes no mention of Alice or Jacob, and leaves their fates ambiguous. 

Alice appears in flashbacks during Freddy's introduction in ''[[Freddy vs. Jason]]'' (2003).

=== Literature ===
Alice is the one of the main protagonists of [[Innovation]]'s 1991 [[A Nightmare on Elm Street (comics)|''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' comics]] from issue 3 and onward. In this comic book series, Alice returns to Springwood following the death of her father and is forced to face Freddy after he again tries to use Jacob to kill for him. In the end, Neil Gordon gives up his body so that he can join [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]] in the "Beautiful Dream." Dan's spirit occupies Neil's body, and he is reunited with Alice and Jacob.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://comicvine.gamespot.com/freddy-vs-jason-vs-ash-of-army-of-darkness-the-nig/4000-173433/|title=Freddy vs Jason vs Ash (of Army of Darkness): The Nightmare Warriors #4|last=|first=|date=|website=comicvine.gamespot.com|publisher=|access-date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the anthology ''The Nightmares on Elm Street: Freddy Krueger's Seven Sweetest Dreams'' (1991),&lt;ref name="autogenerated1991"&gt;Greenberg, M.H. (1991). Nightmares on Elm Street: Freddy Kruger's Seven Sweetest Dreams. St Martin's Press.&lt;/ref&gt; Alice appears in Philip Nutman's story "Dead Highway, Lost Roads." After having been involved in a major accident, Alice becomes ensnared in the dream world by Freddy and trapped in a macabre "Alice in Wonderland" setting. With the aid of serial killer Karl Stolenberg and anthropomorphic armadillo Joe Bob, Jacob eventually finds Alice. A deranged Karl attacks Alice, but is returned to his senses by Jacob through physical force. Alice and Karl cooperate to defeat Freddy, though Karl perishes in the battle. With Freddy defeated, Alice and Jacob return to the waking world. 

She also appears in ''[[Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash: The Nightmare Warriors|Freddy vs. Jason vs. Ash: Nightmare Warriors]]'' where a vision of Freddy causes her to meet with other Freddy and Jason survivors. As with ''[[A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child|The Dream Child]]'', Alice and Jacob are partly linked regarding the "Dream Master" abilities. For instance, a sleeping Jacob has the ability to call an awake Alice. In turn, Alice can physically enter Jacob's dream and wake up in the place that he fell asleep. Alice's dream powers come with a cost, as she has been suffering from a terminal illness. She later sacrifices herself to pass her full powers onto Jacob. The aforementioned comic series is not the only literature that has killed off Alice. Due to Alice having been killed by Freddy, her son Jacob is the main protagonist in Natasha Rhodes' novel ''A Nightmare on Elm Street: Perchance to Dream.''&lt;ref name="autogenerated2006"&gt;Rhodes, N. (2006). A Nightmare on Elm Street: Perchance to Dream. Black Flame.&lt;/ref&gt;

=== In fan films ===
Although not considered a part of the official film canon, Alice (played by Taylor Burskey) has a cameo in ''Don't Fall Asleep: The Film''&lt;ref&gt;{{Citation|last=Venn Pictures|title=Don't Fall Asleep : The Film|date=2016-09-05|url=https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rM98xWLARPc&amp;t=644s|access-date=2018-08-11}}&lt;/ref&gt; (2016; Produced by 3 Count &amp; Go): Taking place between ''A Nightmare on Elm Street'' and ''A Nightmare on Elm Street 3: Dream Warriors'', [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy Thompson]] (played by Diandra Lazor) is struggling to maintain her sanity after she is checked into a psychiatric ward. In the film, Alice's mother is an exhausted nurse that works at the ward.  

== Reception ==
In his book ''Horror Films of the 1980s'', John Kenneth Muir noted the following:

:"Alice's blossoming is coupled with the mirror (an important symbol in the film). When she is weak and diffident, the mirror is loaded with photographs that obscure her reflection. The message is that she doesn't want to see herself; she'd rather hide from what she considers ugly. But as Alice's strength grows, she takes down the photos and countenances her own image. What she finds there is gorgeous and strong."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;Muir, J.K. Horror films of the 1980s.&lt;/ref&gt;

Muir believes that Alice's transformation "is the perfect counterpoint to Freddy's storyline." Whereas Freddy's reflection encompasses evil, Alice's "reflection is what makes her powerful." According to Muir, the character of Alice Johnson, goes against the "final girl" stereotype in that she is a "greasy-haired ugly duckling [who finds] her inner strength and beauty through self-actualization.."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; Furthermore, he adds that "from [[Nancy Thompson (A Nightmare on Elm Street)|Nancy]] to Alice, the women on Elm Street are tough, resourceful, powerful role models for teenagers, ones who--''mirror''--reality in their efforts to navigate high school, and indeed life."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

As Muir summarizes:

:"[Alice is] afraid of what her child will be; she wants to protect it; and she has to fend off Dan's parents, who want to adopt the child...[she must deal] with all of these competing emotions and stresses, not to mention Freddy...."&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt;

Monika Bartyzel stated that Alice is different when compared to other [[final girl]]s and that her empowerment over the course of the films became an essential plot point, she said:
: At first, she’s the shy, introverted hanger-on to her much more wild friends (much like Laurie Strode). She considers herself a non-entity, preferring to mask her mirror, and thereby herself, with her friends’ images. When they die, however, and she mystically consumes portions of their strength, the pictures come down in chunks as she wipes away the old Alice to become the active fighter. Instead of teamwork, the team is infused into one previously passive being, a mecha-human designed to defeat the dream monster. Alice is one of the few true and ongoing Final Girls; she survives two films, saves her child from demonic possession, and disappears from the Nightmare on Elm Street world without ever succumbing to the inevitability of death in a future installment.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.movies.com/movie-news/from-screams-to-strength-evolution-final-girl/10054|title=From Screams to Strength, the Evolution of the Final Girl|last=Bartyzel|first=Monika|date=October 25, 2012|website=Movies.com|publisher=|access-date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;  
The website ''Lady Geek Girl and Friends'' praised the intelligence and strength of the character saying, "Letting go of the past, suiting up for battle with the accoutrements of her fallen friends, and finally looking at herself in the mirror and being damn pleased with what she sees, ugh, it’s one of the best sequences in the series. In the ensuing battle we see just how powerful Alice really is as she is the first heroine in the series to face Freddy in the dream, alone, and triumph. The fight takes her to the limits of what she can do, and everything she’s gained from her friends helps, but in the end it’s her own intelligence that defeats the monster."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://ladygeekgirl.wordpress.com/2013/04/14/the-women-of-elm-street-alice-johnson/|title=The Women of Elm Street: Alice Johnson|last=|first=|date=|website=Lady Geek Girl and Friends|publisher=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly, Tommy Watanabe praised the strength of the character, saying:
: "In the fifth installment of the franchise, Alice fights to protect her unborn child from the possession of Freddy's spirit using more of her abilities, even invading the nightmare of her new bestie (wow, Alice, you move on quick) Yvonne by spearing Freddy with a pipe as he tries to kill Yvonne. Capable and creative, Alice proves to be a strong woman readily available to protect her friends (or attempt to, in the case of comic book artist Mark and aspiring model Greta) and family at any cost. More importantly, she had sex... and survived!"&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://moviepilot.com/posts/3509335|title=The 10 Greatest FINAL GIRLS in TV &amp; Film|last=Watanabe|first=Tommy|date=|website=Movie Pilot|publisher=|access-date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Development ==

=== Conception ===
In ''The Dream Master'' scripts written by William Kotzwinkle, Brian Helgeland, Jim Wheat, and Ken Wheat,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/site/films/a-nightmare-on-elm-street-4-the-dream-master/a-nightmare-on-elm-street-4-the-dream-master-scripts/|title=A Nightmare on Elm Street 4: The Dream Master — Scripts {{!}} Nightmare on Elm Street Companion — Ultimate Online Resource to Horror Series A Nightmare on Elm Street|website=nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com|language=en-US|access-date=2018-08-14}}&lt;/ref&gt; Alice still begins as a shy and introverted individual. A marked difference is that Kristen and Alice have a closer friendship. In the script, before learning about the deaths of Kincaid and Joey, Kristen confides in Alice that she has the ability to pull others into her dreams. When the group explores 1428 Elm Street, a still mystified Alice foreshadows her bravery by volunteering to be pulled into Kristen's dream if the need should arise. Alice asserts herself earlier in the film, describing the supernatural circumstances surrounding Kristen's death to the group. She tells her brother Rick about her newfound abilities, and he plays an active role in trying to keep her awake until he himself is killed. While Alice still has a final showdown with Freddy, she undergoes a physical transformation during the dresser mirror scene in which her body becomes leaner, muscular and adorned with supernatural accouterments.  

With regard to ''The Dream Child'' scripts, Alice still battles Freddy to save her unborn son. Depending upon the script, Alice goes from an active to a passive protagonist as the events unfold. The best example is in the first script draft.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://nightmareonelmstreetfilms.com/Files/nightmare-on-elm-street-5-original-script.pdf|title=A Nightmare on Elm Street 5: The Dream Child (1st draft)|last=Skipp|first=John|last2=Spector|first2=Craig|date=January 7, 1989|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Upon Freddy's resurrection, a cornered Alice is ready to die before pulling in more victims for him to kill. Freddy makes his plans known quickly, as he is the one that informs Alice that she is pregnant. Alice has made new friends, and her past encounters with Freddy are no secret to them. Her straightforward efforts to prepare them for Freddy's onslaught fall short, however. With each murder, Alice still absorbs the souls through her womb but the script specifies that her gestation period is hastened. Alice accumulates her knowledge through help from Jacob (named Jason in the script) who introduces her to a book about dreams. By studying the book, Alice learns how to enter Freddy's mind through the "dream pool" and communicate with Sister Mary Helena (Amanda Krueger). As Freddy advances on Alice, her sonogram shows twins as Freddy's evil fetus is depleting Jacob in a parasitic symbiosis. Due to a warped pregnancy making her physically incapacitated, Alice is unable to fight back against Freddy's machinations. By the script's conclusion, the parasitic Freddy baby leaves Alice's body because of Sister Mary Helena's interference and Jacob is delivered instead.   

As opposed to the film, the first draft of ''The Dream Child'' shows a greater rapport between Jacob and Alice as they research on how to defeat Freddy. Their relationship is further illustrated by Alice and Jacob experiencing the same physical deterioration as the plot unfolds. Yet, Alice does not know the true identity of Jacob until after she gives birth to him. So, in essence, the original plot detail differs from the film in that it impacts Alice's maternal motivation to save Jacob.   

=== Characterization ===
In an interview [[Lisa Wilcox]] described Alice as an outcast that a lot of people can relate to, she said:
: “I immediately fell in love with the story of Alice, she’s a daydreamer who was kind of pathetic at the beginning of Part Four, and I think we all can relate to that feeling in some ways. Actually, I was totally a wallflower in high school so there was a lot of myself in the character of Alice. There’s a lot of Lisa on that screen.”

Wilcox also mentioned the character development of Alice by stating that:  
: "As an actress, though, what made Alice remarkable is that audiences watch Alice become stronger and stronger as the movie plays along, and you can’t help but be a part of her journey because she’s so relatable."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.dreadcentral.com/news/15894/wilcox-lisa-final-girls/|title=Wilcox, Lisa (Final Girls)|last=|first=|date=|website=Dread Central|publisher=|access-date=September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Association of Comics Magazine Publishers''' ('''ACMP''') was an [[United States|American]] [[industry trade group]] formed in the late 1940s to regulate the content of [[comic books]] in the face of public criticism during that time. It was a precursor to the [[Comics Magazine Association of America]], and the ACMP Publishers Code served as the template for a more detailed set of rules enforced by the CMAA's [[Comics Code Authority]].

== History ==
The ACMP was formed in May 1947&lt;ref name=jimv3&gt;Vassallo, Michael J., "The History of Atlas Horror/Fantasy:  The Comics Code 1955" (introduction), ‘’Marvel Masterworks: Atlas Era Journey into Mystery Vol. 3 ‘’ (Marvel Worldwide, 2010), p. vi (unnumbered)&lt;/ref&gt; and publicly announced on July 1, 1948.&lt;ref name=hajdu128&gt;[[David Hajdu|Hajdu, David]]. ''The Ten-Cent Plague: The Great Comic-Book Scare and How It Changed America'' ([[Farrar, Straus and Giroux]], 2008),  p. 128. {{ISBN|0-374-18767-3}}, {{ISBN|978-0-374-18767-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founding members included:
* Phil Keenan, publisher of [[Hillman Periodicals]]
* Leverett Gleason, publisher of [[Lev Gleason Publications]]
* [[Bill Gaines]], publisher of [[EC Comics]]
* Harold Moore, publisher of ''[[Famous Funnies]]''
* [[Rae Herman]], publisher of [[Orbit Publications]]
* Frank Armer, distributor
* Irving Manheimer, distributor&lt;ref name=hajdu128 /&gt;

[[George T. Delacorte, Jr.]], founder of [[Dell Publishing]], which included [[Dell Comics]], served as president,&lt;ref name=jimv3 /&gt; and [[Manhattan]] attorney Henry E. Schultz, president of the board of [[Queens College]] and a member of the [[New York City Board of Higher Education]], as executive director.&lt;ref name=hajdu129&gt;Hajdu, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;
[[File:ComicBookBurningPhoto.jpg|alt=Photo of men and women burning boxes of comics in a bin as a crowd of children watch.|thumb|Comic book burning, c. 1950]]
The ACMP was formed after "accusations from several fronts charged comic books with contributing to the rising rates of [[juvenile delinquency]]",&lt;ref name=jimv3 /&gt; and city and county ordinances had banned some publications&lt;ref&gt;For example, [[Bellingham, Washington|Bellingham]], [[Washington (state)|Washington]] in August 1948 passed a binding prohibition against the sale of 50 specific comic-book series (Hajdu, p. 106); the [[County of Los Angeles]] on September 23, 1948, outlawed the sale of crime comics to minors (Hajdu, p. 107); and that same year the [[American Municipal Association]] reported that nearly 50 municipalities had "banned the sale of certain comic books". (Hajdu, p. 108)&lt;/ref&gt; though these were effectively overturned with a March 29, 1948, [[United States Supreme Court]] ruling that a 64-year-old [[New York State]] law outlawing publications with "pictures and stories of deeds of bloodshed, lust or crime" was unconstitutional.&lt;ref&gt;Hajdu, p. 95.&lt;/ref&gt; Regardless, the uproar increased upon the publication of two articles:
* "Horror in the Nursery", by [[Judith Crist]], in the March 25, 1948, issue of ''[[Collier's Weekly]]'',&lt;ref name=jimv3 /&gt; based upon the symposium "Psychopathology of Comic Books" held a week earlier&lt;ref name=jimv3 /&gt; by [[psychiatrist]]&lt;ref&gt;Hajdu, p. 98.&lt;/ref&gt; [[Fredric Wertham]]
* "The Comics ... Very Funny!", by Frederic Wertham, in the May 29, 1948, issue of ''[[The Saturday Review of Literature]]''&lt;ref&gt;Hajdu, p. 113.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Spencer, West Virginia]] held a [[book burning|comic-book burning]] on October 26, 1948.&lt;ref&gt;Hajdu, p. 116.&lt;/ref&gt; After the [[Associated Press]] reported on it, copycat comic-book burnings followed around the country, particularity in [[Catholic]] parishes.&lt;ref&gt;Hajdu, p. 119.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="psu"&gt;{{cite web|last=Coville |first=Jamie |title=Seduction of the Innocents and the Attack on Comic Books: The Comic Book Villain, Dr. Fredric Wertham, M.D. |work=Integrative Arts 10 |publisher=Penn State University |url=http://www.psu.edu/dept/inart10_110/inart10/cmbk4cca.html |date=n.d. |accessdate=January 25, 2009 |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20090224091233/http://www.psu.edu/dept/inart10_110/inart10/cmbk4cca.html |archivedate=February 24, 2009 |deadurl=bot: unknown |df= }}. Note: article erroneously refers to Wertham as a "psychologist."&lt;/ref&gt;

== Publishers Code ==
In 1948, the association released their "Publishers Code," drawing on the Hollywood [[Production Code]] (better known as the "[[Hays Code]]"), which had also been drafted to stave off external regulation. Like the Production Code, it forbid portrayals of crime that might "throw sympathy against the law" or "weaken respect for established authority," and prohibited "ridicule or attack on any religious or racial group." "Sexy, wanton comics" were not to be published, and [[divorce]] was not to be "treated humorously or represented as glamorous or alluring." Comics that complied with the code were offered a "Seal of Approval."

=== ACMP Publishers Code of 1948 ===
#Sexy, wanton comics should not be published. No drawing should show a female indecently or unduly exposed, and in no event more nude than in a bathing suit commonly worn in the United States of America.
#Crime should not be presented in such a way as to throw sympathy against the law and justice or to inspire others with the desire for imitation. No comics shall show the details and methods of a crime committed by a youth. Policemen, judges, Government officials, and respected institutions should not be portrayed as stupid, ineffective, or represented in such a way to weaken respect for established authority.
#No scenes of sadistic torture should be shown.
#Vulgar and obscene language should never be used. Slang should be kept to a minimum and used only when essential to the story.
#Divorce should not be treated humorously or represented as glamorous or alluring.
#Ridicule or attack on any religious or [[Race (classification of human beings)|racial]] group is never permissible.&lt;ref&gt;Hajdu, p. 128.&lt;/ref&gt;

== Dissolution of the ACMP ==
The code, however, was not a success, ignored by both large and small publishers. Some publishers, such as [[Dell Comics]], refused to join the organization. Others, such as founding member EC Comics, terminated their participation. Those who continued as members made use of the ACMP seal of approval without any formal process of review. Describing the situation in 1954 at the [[Senate subcommittee on juvenile delinquency|Senate comic book hearings]], Director Schultz said: "The association, I would say, is out of business and so is the code."&lt;ref name="senate"&gt;{{cite web|author=83rd United States Congress |author2=Committee on the Judiciary (Harley M. Kilgore, Chairman) |title=Comic Books and Juvenile Delinquency: Interim Report of the Committee on the judiciary pursuant to S. Res. 89 and S. Res. 190 |work=Congressional Record |publisher=United States Congress |date=March 14, 1955 |url=http://class.georgiasouthern.edu/writ3030/1954SenateInterimReport.doc |accessdate=January 25, 2009 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20070510142944/http://class.georgiasouthern.edu/writ3030/1954SenateInterimReport.doc |archivedate=May 10, 2007 }}
&lt;/ref&gt;

== Successor organization&lt;!--'Comics Magazine Association of America' redirects here--&gt;==
In 1954, a mounting tide of criticism, including a new book by Wertham — ''[[Seduction of the Innocent]]'' — and congressional hearings, spurred the formation of the ACMP's successor, the '''Comics Magazine Association of America'''&lt;!--boldface per WP:R#PLA--&gt; ('''CMAA'''). The ACMP Publishers Code served as the template for a more detailed set of rules enforced by the CMAA's [[Comics Code Authority]].

EC comics and Mad magazine publisher, [[William M. Gaines]], in a 1983 interview with ''[[The Comics Journal]]'' revealed:
{{quote|After the Senate Subcommittee hearings, and this isn’t very well known, but I can prove it again, I sent a letter to every comics publisher, invited them to a meeting and footed the bill for the hall. We took a big place somewhere, and all these people showed up and I tried to convince them that we should form an association and hire the Gleuks of Harvard or anybody else we could find who could do some sort of independent, honest research into whether comic books in truth were the horrendous things that people said they were. And since I really didn’t think they were, I figured, such a study would exonerate us. None of these guys wanted to do that, and right away the whole thing was taken away from me, and they turned it into a situation where they wrote a Code, and the Code forbade the use of the words 'horror,' 'terror,' or 'crime' — this was all my books — and 'weird,' even 'weird,' [laughter] so that would wipe me out. So I didn’t join the association. But then I decided to drop all those books anyway and put out the [[New Direction (comics)|New Direction]] stuff. I put out the six first issues, six bi-monthlies, and they sold 10, 15 percent. You can’t believe how horrendous the sales were. And I later found out that it was because the word was passed by the wholesalers, "Get ‘im!" So they got me.{{citation needed|date=September 2017}} }}

'''''Barb Wire''''' is a 1996 American [[Action film|action]] [[thriller film]] based on the [[Dark Horse Comics|Dark Horse]] [[Barb Wire|comic book series of the same name]]. [[Brad Wyman]] produced, and David Hogan directed. ''Barb Wire'' stars [[Pamela Anderson]] in the title role.

==Plot==
''Barb Wire'' is set in 2017 during the "[[Second American Civil War]]". Barb Wire ([[Pamela Anderson]]) owns the Hammerhead, a nightclub in [[Steel Harbor]] — "the last free city" in a [[United States]] ravaged by the civil war — and she brings in extra cash working as a [[mercenary]] and [[bounty hunter]]. Chief of Police Willis ([[Xander Berkeley]]) raids her club. Willis's target is fugitive Dr. Corrina "Cora D" Devonshire ([[Victoria Rowell]]), a former government scientist with information about a bioweapon being developed by her former superior, Colonel Pryzer ([[Steve Railsback]]) of the Congressional Directorate. Dr. Devonshire hopes to escape to [[Canada]] in order to make this information public.

Devonshire later turns up at the Hammerhead. She is accompanied by Axel Hood ([[Temuera Morrison]]), a "[[freedom fighter]]" whom Barb had known and loved at the outbreak of the war, but the two were separated during the conflict. Axel is trying to help Cora get to Canada. They are trying to find a contraband pair of [[contact lens]]es that will allow Cora to evade the [[retinal scan]] at the Steel Harbor airport. The lenses pass through the hands of several lowlifes before also ending up at Barb's nightclub.

Rather than give the lenses to Cora and Axel, Barb makes a deal with "Big Fatso" (Andre Rosey Brown), the leader of a [[wrecking yard|junkyard]] gang: Fatso wants the lenses, which are worth a fortune on the [[black market]], and Barb wants a million dollars and an armed escort to the airport, where ''she'' plans to get on the plane to Canada. But Fatso double-crosses Barb; when Barb, Axel, and Cora show up at the junkyard to make the swap, Colonel Pryzer and his storm troopers are also there, along with Chief of Police Willis. Willis makes a show of arresting Barb and Cora, but instead of putting [[handcuffs]] on Barb, he slips her a [[hand grenade]]. Barb uses the grenade to kill Fatso and cause enough confusion to allow Barb, Axel, Cora, and Willis to pile into Barb's armored van and lead the Congressionals on a [[car chase]], culminating in a hand-to-hand fight between Barb and Colonel Pryzer on a forklift suspended by crane above the harbor. Pryzer falls to his death while Barb escapes.

In the end, the party makes it to the airport, where Barb reveals that she still has the contact lenses. She gives them to Cora, and Cora and Axel get on the plane to Canada while Willis and Barb remain on the rainswept tarmac.

In the film, Anderson's waist was laced down to {{convert|17|in|cm}}. She did some of her own stunts, although the [[corset]] and the heels she wore made fight scenes very challenging.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |archiveurl=http://web.archive.org/web/20010528194011/http://www.pamwatch.com:80/interview5.html|archivedate=May 28, 2001|url=http://www.pamwatch.com/interview5.html |title=Sky Magazine Interview |date=May 1996 |publisher=PamWatch.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.pamwatch.com/bio.html |title=Biography of  Pamela Denise Anderson |publisher=PamWatch.com |date=March 13, 2007}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Reception==
''Barb Wire'' generally received negative reactions by critics and was a [[box office bomb]]. It holds a 28% approval rating on [[Rotten Tomatoes]] based on 36 reviews (10 positive, 26 negative), with the consensus stating that "''Barb Wire'' could've been fun camp, but Pamela Anderson can't deliver her lines with any dramatic or comedic impact".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.rottentomatoes.com/m/barb_wire/ |title=Barb Wire |publisher=Rotten Tomatoes |date= |accessdate=2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] pointed out that the film's plot was identical to that of ''[[Casablanca (film)|Casablanca]]'' and derided the low-brow attempts at sensuality, but praised the cast and crew's approach to the material: "The filmmakers must have known they were not making a good movie, but they didn't use that as an excuse to be boring and lazy. ''Barb Wire'' has a high energy level, and a sense of deranged fun." He gave it two and a half stars.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19960503/REVIEWS/605030301 |title=Roger Ebert - '&amp;#39;Chicago Sun-Times'&amp;#39; |publisher=Rogerebert.suntimes.com |date= 1996-05-03|accessdate=2011-02-09}}&lt;/ref&gt; Similarly to Ebert, [[Owen Gleiberman]] of ''[[Entertainment Weekly]]'' commented on the film's aping of the ''Casablanca'' plot and its "teasing, hollow 'naughtiness'", but further said that the film is lacking in energy. He gave it a C.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Gleiberman|first=Owen|authorlink=Owen Gleiberman |title=Barb Wire|url=http://ew.com/article/1996/05/10/barb-wire/|website=[[Entertainment Weekly]]|accessdate=7 December 2017|date=May 10, 1996}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a [[Balinese temple|Balinese temple architecture]],  a '''Bhoma''' is a carved or formed [[Chimera (architecture)|grotesque]] which decorates certain parts in the Balinese temple complex. The statue is similar to the Javanese [[Batara Kala|Kala]], and was intended to protect the temple complex from malevolent spirit.

==Mythology==
[[File:COLLECTIE TROPENMUSEUM Zilveren broche voorstellende een Bhoma monsterkop TMnr 2252-6.jpg|thumb|left|The bhoma in a silver brooch.]]
In Balinese mythology, Bhoma is the son of [[Vishnu|Dewa Wisnu]] and [[Prithvi|Dewi Pertiwi]], the god of rain and the goddess of earth. One day, when Wisnu was digging the earth in the form of [[Varaha]], his avatar in the form of a wild boar, he encountered a beautiful earth goddess named Dewi Pertiwi. The encounter leads to a union between Wisnu and Pertiwi, which produce a terrifying son named Bhoma. 

The story of Wisnu as a wild boar digging up to the bottom of the earth to meet Pertiwi symbolizes torrents of stormy rainwater entering the earth. The figure of Bhoma that was produced by this union is seen as the growth of vegetation or forest ([[Vanaspati]]) as a result of the earth receiving the (rain) water. In Javanese and Balinese culture, Vanaspati is the king of the plant, not different with the European [[Green Man]]. The word Bhoma came from the Sanskrit word ''bhaumá'', which means something that grows or is born from earth or something related to the earth.  

==Architecture==
[[File:Balinese temple pillar.jpg|thumb|left|In the [[Padmasana (shrine)|Padmasana]], the central shrine of a Balinese temple complex, the Bhoma head is carved at the bottom of Padmasana shrine to symbolize the forest which surrounds the base of a mountain.]] 
Bhoma is basically the Balinese [[kirtimukha]]. In Balinese temple architecture, Bhoma has the same function as the Javanese [[Batara Kala|Kala]] which act as a guardian spirit of the temple complex. The head of Bhoma can be found carved at the temple gate which marks the entrance to the holiest part of the shrine ([[paduraksa]]) and at the base of the padmasana, the holiest and most central shrine in the Balinese temple.

The [[Padmasana (shrine)|Padmasana]] is the holiest shrine in a Balinese temple complex. The padmasana is attributed to the Supreme God, the [[Acintya|Sang Hyang Widhi Wasa]]). Like many religious constructions in Indonesia, the shrine padmasana is divided into three sections, from the base to the top, the ''bhur'' (world of demons), ''bhuwah'' (world of men), and ''swah'' (world of gods). The head figure of Bhoma normally added the base of the padmasana, together with other monstrous figures e.g. the Bedawang Nala, the world-supporting turtle, and the two snakes, Anantaboga, and Basuki, a symbol of man's earthly needs. In this context, the head of Bhoma at the base of the padmasana symbolizes the forest which surrounds the foot of a mountain (''batur pepalihan'').{{sfn|Eiseman|2011}} 

In some Balinese houses, the doorway to some enclosed pavilion (e.g. the ''[[Balinese traditional house|bale meten]]'') is decorated with ornaments to form ventilation grill which is sometimes paneled. This is usually topped with a decorative frieze, which is sometimes carved in the form of the Bhoma's head.{{sfn|Davison|Granquist|2012}}

The head of Bhoma is also seen in the [[Ngaben|Balinese cremation towers]].{{sfn|Slattum|2003|pp=100-1}}

'''COWI A/S''' is an international [[Consultant|consulting]] group, specialising in [[engineering]], [[environmental science]] and [[economics]], based in [[Lyngby]], [[Denmark]].

It has been involved in more than 50,000 projects in 175 countries and has approximately 6,400 employees, including [[engineers]], [[biologists]], [[geologists]], [[economists]], [[Surveying|surveyors]], [[anthropologists]], [[sociologists]] and [[architects]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cowi.com/topmenu/aboutcowi/factsandfiguresthequickversion/ |title=Facts and figures - the quick version |accessdate=2016-09-22 |work= |publisher=COWI |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
COWI was founded in 1930 by civil engineer Christen Ostenfeld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cowi.com/cowi/en/topmenu/aboutcowi/ThestoryofCOWI/193040/ |title=1930 - 1940: A nightclub – the first step towards an international company |accessdate=2009-02-03 |work= |publisher=COWI |date= |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080315120836/http://www.cowi.com/cowi/en/topmenu/aboutcowi/ThestoryofCOWI/193040/ |archivedate=2008-03-15 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; Wriborg W. Jønson became a partner 16 years later. From 1946 to 1973, the company operated as a partnership under the name of Chr. Ostenfeld &amp; W. Jønson. The initials of the two senior partners lent the company its name.

In 1973, the company became foundation-owned enterprise and was renamed COWIconsult, Consulting Engineers and Planners AS. In 1995, the company changed its name to COWI Consulting Engineers and Planners AS, eventually becoming COWI A/S in 2001.

In 2008 the firm bought [[Flint &amp; Neill]], a UK civil and structural engineering consultancy specialising in bridges.

In November 2014, the firm acquired Donaldson Associates Ltd, a UK base tunneling specialist company.  At the time of acquisition, Donaldson Associates Ltd had 150 staff, operating from 5 UK offices and one international office in Hong Kong.

==Ownership==
COWI Holding A/S is an unlisted Danish public limited liability company jointly owned by the COWIfonden (the COWIfoundation) holding 85% of shares with the remaining 15% of company shares held by current and former employees from eight different countries where COWI operates. The company regards employee shareholders as co-owners. The current company structure was adapted in 2010.&lt;ref name="AboutCOWI"&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.cowi.com/topmenu/aboutcowi/organisation/ownership/ |title=About COWI Ownership |accessdate=2016-09-22 |publisher=COWI |date= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Coloroll'''  is a United Kingdom [[wallpaper]] brand owned by CWV Ltd.

Developed from a family-owned wallpaper company founded in the 1970s, during the 1980s Coloroll Group became a dominant publicly listed [[home furnishing]]s business, which collapsed in 1990 through excessive debt. Of the ten residual brands that survived the collapse, nine of the businesses survive presently.&lt;ref name=Indp1505777/&gt;

==Foundation==
The company was founded in 1970 by the Gatward family, as a printed [[paper bag]] manufacturer.&lt;ref name=Indp1505777/&gt; After hiring marketing manager John Bray, he developed a strategy to move into wallpaper manufacture. Hiring designers John Wilman and Linda Beard, they developed a range similar to the classic fashion look developed by Welsh entrepreneur [[Laura Ashley]].&lt;ref name=Indp1505777/&gt; To develop new overseas markets, Bray hired John Ashcroft from competitor [[Crown Wallpaper]] as export manager.&lt;ref name=Indp1368331/&gt;

==Coloroll Group==
Appointed managing director in 1981, Ashcroft bought the Gatwards and Bray out of the business in 1984.&lt;ref name=Indp1505777/&gt;

Ashcroft's strategy was to extend the Wilman/Beard designs across a range of home furnishings, to provide a co-ordinated whole home look to the consumer. After floating the business in 1985&amp;nbsp;– leading shareholders included the pension funds of [[Scottish Amicable]] and [[British Coal]]&amp;nbsp;– the company spent £420&amp;nbsp;million in the next five years on acquisitions, of which £16&amp;nbsp;million was spent in the United States, taking the strategic vision into a reality.&lt;ref name=Indp1505777/&gt;

The brands they bought included:&lt;ref name=Indp1505777/&gt;
*[[Alexander Drew (company)|Alexander Drew]], printing
*[[Burlington Wallcoverings]], later sold to [[Graham &amp; Brown]]
*[[Denby Pottery Company]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.stokemuseums.org.uk/collections/browse_collections/ceramics/coloroll|title=Coloroll Ceramics|publisher=Stoke Museums|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

*[[Staffordshire Potteries Ltd]], sold off in the collapse of 1990 as [[Staffordshire Tableware]]
*[[William Barrett Group]], furniture, later bought by property developers with assets sold to [[Hampson Industries]]
*[[Edward Fogarty]], duvet/pillow supplier
*[[Walmates Vinyl]], US wallpaper manufacturer 

===Collapse===
In 1988, the group paid £215&amp;nbsp;million for recently created clothing and carpet conglomerate [[John Crowther]], which had not itself been fully integrated. When Coloroll bought the [[John Crowther group]] they acquired [[Herbert Johnson (hatters)|Herbert Johnson]]. Coloroll sold this London firm of hatters to a management buy-out team called the [[Response Group]].&lt;ref&gt;See Prior, Katherine (2012). ''In Good Hands: 250 Years of Craftsmanship at [[Swaine Adeney Brigg]]''.  Cambridge: [[John Adamson (publisher)|John Adamson]].  {{ISBN|978-1-898565-09-3}} {{OCLC|815728722}}, p. 133.&lt;/reF&gt; In 1989, the United States wallpaper operations were sold off to create cash. In 1990, a refinancing exercise led to an audit by the banks that showed that group debt was at £350&amp;nbsp;million. Refusing to underwrite the rising debt without an additional capital injection, proposed buyer [[Candover Investments]] withdrew when the debt level increased to nearly £500&amp;nbsp;million.&lt;ref name=Indp1505777/&gt;

In June 1990, the [[High Court]] agreed at the banks' request to the appointment of [[Ernst &amp; Young]] as receivers. In six months they agreed eight [[management buyout]]s, and sold off two other business. 1,500 employees in non-saleable businesses were made redundant, while less than half of the £200&amp;nbsp;million owed to the banks was recovered; lead lender [[NatWest]] took a £25&amp;nbsp;million loss. Swedish investment companies [[Mercurius (Sweden)|Mercurius]] and [[Proventus]], who had each paid £2.3&amp;nbsp;million for 5 per cent of the group in February 1990, lost their entire investment.&lt;ref name=Indp1505777&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/rolling-over-the-past-three-years-after-the-demise-of-coloroll-david-bowen-picks-through-the-rubble-and-finds-strength-among-the-survivors-1505777.html|title=Rolling over the past|author=David Bowen|newspaper=[[The Independent]]|date=21 November 1993|accessdate=11 April 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2730">A family of [[computer]] models is said to be '''compatible''' if certain [[software]] that runs on one of the models can also be run on all other models of the family.  The computer models may differ in [[Computer performance|performance]], [[Reliability engineering|reliability]] or some other characteristic.  These differences may affect the outcome of the running of the software. 

== Software compatibility ==

Software compatibility can refer to the compatibility that a particular software has running on a particular [[CPU architecture]] such as Intel or [[PowerPC]]. Software compatibility can also refer to ability for the software to run on a particular [[operating system]]. Very rarely is a [[Object file|compiled software]] compatible with multiple different CPU architectures. Normally, an application is compiled for different CPU architectures and operating systems to allow it to be compatible with the different system. [[Interpreter (computing)|Interpreted software]], on the other hand, can normally run on many different CPU architectures and operating systems if the interpreter is available for the architecture or operating system. Software incompatibility occurs many times for new software released for a newer version of an operating system which is incompatible with the older version of the operating system because it may miss some of the features and functionality that the software depends on.

== Hardware compatibility ==

Hardware compatibility can refer to the compatibility of computer hardware components with a particular [[CPU architecture]], bus, [[motherboard]] or [[operating system]]. Hardware that is compatible may not always run at its highest stated performance, but it can nevertheless work with [[Legacy system|legacy components]]. An example is [[RAM]] chips, some of which can run at a lower (or sometimes higher) [[clock rate]] than rated. Hardware that was designed for one operating system may not work for another, if device or kernel drivers are unavailable. For example, much of the hardware for [[Mac OS X]] is [[proprietary hardware]] with drivers unavailable for use in operating systems such as [[Linux]].

'''Cordel literature '''(from the [[Portuguese language|Portuguese]] term, ''literatura de cordel'', literally “string literature”) are popular and inexpensively printed booklets or [[pamphlets]] containing [[folklore|folk]] [[novels]], [[poems]] and [[songs]]. They are produced and sold in street markets and by street vendors in [[Brazil]], principally in the [[Northeast of Brazil|Northeast]]. They are so named because they are hung from strings to display them to potential customers.

== History ==
Cordel literature forms one of the least altered continuations of the Western traditions of popular literature, such as [[chapbook]]s, and [[popular prints]]. They come from the ''[[papel volante]]'' tradition of [[Portugal]]. This genre of literature was also found in Spain during the 18th and 19th centuries, and offered readers a wide array of topics, from basic instruction to political tracts.{{citation needed|date=January 2015}}

According to the poet [[Carlos Drummond de Andrade]] it is one of the purest manifestations of the inventive spirit, the sense of humor and the critical capacity of Brazilians from the interior and of the humblest backgrounds.&lt;ref name=Slater&gt;{{cite book|last1=Slater|first1=Candace |authorlink=Candace Slater |title=A vida no barbante: a literatura de cordel no Brasil|date=1984|publisher=Civilização Brasileira|location=Rio de Janeiro|page=2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Form ==
[[File:Xilogravura de Yolanda Carvalho.JPG|thumb|right|Woodcut by Yolanda Carvalho]]
Usually produced in black and white, in [[quarto]] format, ''cordel'' chapbooks are usually illustrated with [[woodcut]]s. Often both the author or poet’s and the woodcut artist’s names will appear in the credits of the book. Two expressive woodcutters are Adir Botelho and José Francisco Borges, whose woodcuts have been exhibited in the [[Louvre]] and the [[Smithsonian]].

The cordel literature found its zenith in the decades of 20s and 30s, with the popular legend created by the [[cangaço|cangaceiros]] of [[Lampião]], a band of outlaws and bandolier bandits who terrorized the region for almost 20 years. The [[War of Canudos]], a military conflict in the state of [[Bahia]], 1896-1897, has been also a frequent theme of cordel literature, due to its epic dimensions and importance for the history of the [[Sertão|Northeast backlands]].

Cordel literature can still be found in the Northeastern Brazilian states, most notably in [[Pernambuco]], [[Paraíba]] and [[Ceará]].

== Authors ==
Some of the main authors from the past are Leandro Gomes de Barros (1865-1918)&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.recantodasletras.com.br/artigos/976198|title=A literatura de cordel e Leandro Gomes De Barros: Vida e obra|work=Recanto das Letras|accessdate=4 January 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; and João Martins de Athayde (1880-1959). 

Today some Cordel Literature authors as Marcelo Soares, [[Davi Teixeira]], Meca Moreco and Altair Leal are keeping this popular expression alive. They and others are helping to show to Brazil and the world the importance of popular art.

There are a lot of not-well-known cordel authors in Brazil, although there are still chapbooks that tell widely known old tales, even reivented, in a new context. See as an example a masterpiece of the past decades: ''A Chegada de Lampião no Inferno'' (The Arrival of Lampião in Hell) by José Pacheco, as well as today's ''A Chegada de Lula no Inferno'' (The Arrival of Lula in Hell); besides "classics", living folk poetry say to us much both about cordel and its strong roots in the day-to-day life of the people and its place in the Brazilian Culture as a whole.

'''Dorota Kędzierzawska''' ({{IPA-pl|dɔˈrɔta kɛɲd͡ʑɛˈʐafska}}; born 1 June 1957 in [[Łódź]]) is a [[Poland|Polish]] [[Film director|director]] of feature and documentary films.

Kędzierzawska graduated from the [[National Film School in Łódź]] in 1981 but prior to that had completed a course in [[cultural studies]] at the [[University of Łódź]] and studied film directing in [[Moscow]] for two years.

Kędzierzawska is the director of several acclaimed films, such as ''Crows'', ''Nothing'', ''I Am'', and ''Devils, Devils''. In her films she concentrates on the experiences of disadvantaged children who contend with a difficult financial situation, rejection by adults, or both. Her characters are usually women, hopelessly fighting for the love of their men. Her most recent film, ''Time to Die'' (''Pora Umierać'', 2007), is a powerful black-and-white depiction of the daily life of an old woman named Aniela, played by Polish screen and stage legend [[Danuta Szaflarska]].

Dorota Kędzierzawska directed the following movies:&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0444328|title=Dorota Kedzierzawska |accessdate=9 June 2017 |publisher=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A [[Carolingian-era]] [[equestrian statue]]tte in bronze depicting either [[Charlemagne]] or his grandson [[Charles the Bald]], a rare example of surviving [[Carolingian sculpture]] in metal, is exhibited in the [[Louvre Museum]]. In the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries it was kept in [[Metz Cathedral]].

The statuette consists of three parts: the horse, the rider's body with the saddle, and the rider's head. It has a total height of 24&amp;nbsp;cm.
The rider is depicted with a moustache, an open crown on his head, a sword in his right hand (lost), an [[imperial orb]] in his left hand, and a riding cloak fastened with a fibula. It was most likely made around 870, i.e. during the reign of Charles the Bald. Carolingian metalwork continues the  [[Gallo-Roman]] tradition of casting and takes as its templates the equestrian bronzes of the Roman imperial period, such as the [[Equestrian Statue of Marcus Aurelius]] or the [[Regisole]] of Pavia.

The features of the rider agree with depictions on Charlemagne on coins as well as with the description by [[Einhard]] in his ''[[Vita Karoli Magni]]'', and the statuette is usually referred to as the "statuette of Charlemagne", but it is possible that the statuette may in fact depict Charlemagne's grandson, [[Charles the Bald]]. If so, his depiction in the likeness of his grandfather would have been intentional.
Clemens (1890) argued for the statuette's Carolingian age, against Wolfram (1890), and he agreed with Aus'm Weerth (1885) on the point that it is impossible to judge whether it depicts Charlemagne or Charles the Bald.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Clemens, ''Die Porträtdarstellungen Karls des Grossen'', Aachen (1890), pp. 45, 230;
Karl Georg Wolfram, ''Die Reiterstatuette Karls des Grossen aus der Kathedrale zu Metz'', Karl J. Trübner, Strasbourg, 1890;
cited after F. F. Leitschuh,  ''Geschichte Der Karolingischen Malerei'' (1894), [https://books.google.ch/books?id=lGgPAwAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA242  p. 242].&lt;/ref&gt; Scholarship of the late 20th century appears more inclined to opt for depiction of Charles the Bald, based on the circumstantial evidence that the work most likely dates to his reign and was kept at [[Metz Cathedral]], suggesting that it may have been commissioned in 869 on the occasion of Charles the Bald's coronation as [[Kingdom of Lotharingia|king of Lothringia]] there.&lt;ref&gt;Egon Boshof, "Karl der Kahle &amp;mdash; novus Karolus magnus?" in: Franz-Reiner Erkens (ed.), ''Karl der Große und das Erbe der Kulturen: Akten des 8. Symposiums des Mediävistenverbandes'', Walter de Gruyter, 2001, 135&amp;ndash;152 ([https://books.google.ch/books?id=XLbmBQAAQBAJ&amp;pg=PA135   p. 135]).
Charles was crowned in [[Metz]] in 869 following the death of [[Lothair II]]; [[Lotharingia]] was divided between East and [[West Francia]] in the following year with he [[Treaty of Meerssen]]. Metz passed to [[East Francia]] and remained part of the [[Holy Roman Empire]] for the remainder of the medieval period, being incorporated into the [[kingdom of France]] only with the [[Treaty of Chambord]] of 1552. See J. L. Nelson, ''Charles the Bald'', The Medieval World Series, Longman, London (1992), 68f.&lt;/ref&gt;

The inventories of Metz cathedral from the 16th century on list two statuettes of Charlemagne; one of gilded silver, made by the  Metz silversmith François in 1507, and the other of bronze or "gilded copper", first inventorized in 1567. Both statuettes re-appear in inventories of the 16th century. In 1807, the bronze statuette was acquired by [[Alexandre Lenoir]], founder of the  [[ Musée des Monuments Français]], in 1807. After Lenoir's death in 1839, his heirs sold it to the private collector Madame Evans-Lombe, who exhibited it at the ''[[Exposition Universelle (1855)|Exposition Universelle]]'' of 1855, after which she sold it to the city of Paris for 5,000 [[Latin Monetary Union|francs]]. It was kept in the [[Carnavalet Museum]] for some time, and it was transferred to the [[Louvre]] in 1934 (accession number OA 8260).

'''Gothic boxwood miniatures''' are very small [[wood carving|carved wood]] [[Christian]] religious sculptures produced during the 15th and 16th centuries, mostly in [[Early Netherlandish painting|today's Low Countries]], at the end of the [[Gothic art|Gothic period]] of [[Northern Renaissance|northern European art]].&lt;ref name="es"&gt;Sharpe, Emily. "[https://www.theartnewspaper.com/news/good-things-come-in-small-packages-at-the-rijksmuseum Good things come in small packages at the Rijksmuseum]". ''[[The Art Newspaper]]'', 17 June 2017. Retrieved 8 October 2018&lt;/ref&gt; They consist of highly intricate layers of [[relief]]s often rendered to nearly microscopic level. The miniatures are made of [[Buxus|boxwood]], which has a fine grain and high density suitable for detailed micro carving. There are around 150 surviving examples. The majority are spherical beads ([[prayer nut]]s), statuettes, skulls, or coffins; some 20 are in the form of [[polyptych]]s such as [[triptych]] or [[diptych]] [[altarpieces]], or [[Church tabernacle|tabernacle]]s and [[monstrance]]s.&lt;ref name="SuS"&gt;Suda, Sasha; Ellis, Lisa. "[https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eD5M-je1yf4 Small Wonders: Gothic Boxwood Miniatures Introduction]". [[Art Gallery of Ontario]], 28 October 2016. Retrieved 24 November 2017&lt;/ref&gt; The polyptychs tend to be in the 10–13 cm height range, while most of the beads are 10–15 cm in diameter; the latter were designed so they could be held in the palm of a hand during personal devotion, or hung from necklaces and belts as fashionable accessories.

Boxwood miniatures were highly prized in the early 16th century. Their iconography, form, and utility can be linked to medieval [[ivory diptychs]], as well as contemporary [[Miniature (illuminated manuscript)|illuminated miniatures]], altarpieces, panel paintings, sculpture, [[woodcut]]s, and engravings. They often contain imagery from the life of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]], the [[Crucifixion of Jesus]], and vistas of [[Heaven]] and [[Hell]]. Each miniature's production required exceptional craftsmanship, and some may have taken decades of [[man-hours|cumulative work]] to complete, suggesting that they were commissioned by high-ranking nobles.

A number of the miniatures appear to have come from a workshop led by Adam Dircksz, who is thought to have produced dozens of miniatures. Almost nothing is known about Dircksz, outside of a Latin signature on a single work now held in Copenhagen, and little is known of the artisans who produced the miniatures. Some of the original owners can be identified from markings, usually initials or coats of arms, placed by the sculptors.&lt;ref name="m162"&gt;Marks (1977), p. 162&lt;/ref&gt; Important collections are in the [[Art Gallery of Ontario]], in the [[British Museum]] as part of the [[Waddesdon Bequest]], and at the [[Metropolitan Museum of Art]], New York.&lt;ref&gt;Thornton (1985), pp. 162–194&lt;/ref&gt; Because of their rarity and the difficulty in discerning their intricacy from reproductions, boxwood miniatures are relatively understudied compared to other forms of Netherlandish visual art.

==Production==

[[Buxus sempervirens|Boxwood]] is a dense hardwood with fine [[Wood grain|grain]], resistant to splitting and chipping—ideal for wood carving.&lt;ref name="l25"&gt;Ellis; Suda (2016), p. 25&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Drake Boehm, Barbara; Suda, Alexandra. "[http://boxwood.ago.ca/publication/what-boxwood What is Boxwood?]". Art Gallery of Ontario. Retrieved 22 September 2018&lt;/ref&gt; In the 16th century, [[woodcut]] blocks used for [[woodblock printing]] were usually made of boxwood. Uses for boxwood were similar to those for ivory in medieval carvings, but with boxwood a far less expensive option than ivory.&lt;ref name="s23"&gt;Scholten (2017), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt; Designs were overseen by master craftsmen who must have had access to prints and [[woodcuts]] of contemporary works of art, and who were apparently influenced by diptych and triptych panel paintings.&lt;ref name="l23"&gt;Ellis; Suda (2016), p. 23&lt;/ref&gt;

Boxwood grows slowly, so the trunk remains fairly narrow, a fact that impedes the size of any carvings made from any single piece. In addition, the wood assumes an even, soft and tactile surface if polished or, more importantly, frequently handled; especially the prayer nuts were intended to be held in the owner's hand.&lt;ref name="s20"&gt;Scholten (2017), p. 20&lt;/ref&gt; The wood loses its tactility when painted over, explaining why most of the miniatures are in monochrome. In addition, polychromy would have reduced the legibility of the carvings, "quite 
apart from the difficulty of effectively coloring such tiny and complex scenes" as the art historian [[Frits Scholten]] has noted.&lt;ref&gt;Scholten (2017), pp. 22–23&lt;/ref&gt; 

The tools used in production were similar to those used in the production of larger [[altarpiece]]s and would have included [[saw]]s, [[Plane (tool)|planes]], [[card scraper]]s, chisels, [[auger (drill)|augers]], braces, and [[gimlet (tool)|gimlets]]. Wood was cut into the required dimensions as blocks, after which the [[joiner|joins]] were carved out. Prayer beads were made on a [[lathe]] used to [[Woodturning|turn]] the wood.&lt;ref name="t162"&gt;Thornton (1985), p. 162&lt;/ref&gt;  The woodcutters carved a single block of boxwood into a sphere, which was then cut in half, hollowed out and attached to a fastening hinge and carrying loops. The carvings in the interiors were typically made separately from the smaller hemispheres and later fitted onto an outer shell.&lt;ref name="t164" /&gt;

[[File:BLW Portable Shrine.jpg|300px|left|thumb|Miniature altar, height: 9.3cm, boxwood and silver, c. 1500–20, Netherlandish. [[Victoria and Albert Museum]], London]]
Because of their diminutive scale, the pieces were produced using magnifying glasses.&lt;ref name="s57"&gt;Scholten (2017), p. 57&lt;/ref&gt; The very small wood pieces were difficult to hold in place (brace) during carving. They were likely positioned on a bench, between two posts, so that they could be turned around. Domed spaces, intended to evoke church architecture, were drilled or carved, and these were divided, using [[compass]]es and a [[straight edge]], into pie-shaped segments. A surface plane was established onto which the [[relief]]s would be added. These would have been created from multiple separate wood sheets, individually produced before being joined in layers.&lt;ref name="l25" /&gt; Major figures, usually saints, were carved from single blocks of wood.

the full sized Flemish and [[Brabantine Gothic|Brabantine]] altarpieces, they were for centuries assumed to originate from [[Southern Netherlands]], however more recent research has found that a majority of the early owners came from the northern provinces of [[County of Holland|Holland]] and [[Zeeland]].&lt;ref name="sc31"&gt;Scholten (2017), p. 31&lt;/ref&gt; There are examples from Italy, although according to Wilhelm Bode, "The broad monumental tendency of Italian art, especially in sculpture, seems to exclude a taste for daintily executed small works".&lt;ref&gt;Bode (1904), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt; German examples include a carving encased in a miniature skull, now in the Art Gallery of Ontario, which contains branchwork (''Astwerk'') of a type often found in contemporary German sculpture.&lt;ref name="ws171"&gt;Wetter; Scholten (2017), p. 171&lt;/ref&gt;

That a majority of the miniatures share technical, stylistic, and thematic similarities, and could be considered as a near homogeneous group was first noted by the art historian Jaap Leeuwenberg.&lt;ref name="s339"&gt;Scholten (2011), p. 339&lt;/ref&gt; Such stylistic traits include broad and densely populated animated scenes, often placed, in the words of the art historian William Wixom, on "steeply angled ground planes of tiled floors".&lt;ref name="w43"&gt;Wixom (1983), p. 43&lt;/ref&gt; Other shared features include spatial devices, figures in contemporary dress, and draperies arranged in angular folds.

Regardless of the number of works that Dircksz or his workshop can be attributed with, art historians often debate what the artistic and technical precedents for the miniatures might be. Scholten observes how, to a large extent, it seems "as if this exquisite sculpture was born ex nihilo around 1500", but points out that "giant strides are rarely made in art history", pointing to affinities with silversmith's art, especially the miniature architectural elements often found in ecclesiastical silver and ornaments.&lt;ref name="sc31" /&gt;

Owing to the commonality of materials, production techniques, and the general absence of paint application, the miniatures would have have had similar original colouring. This has diverged over the centuries, given various storage and handling methods, as well as different restorations and coating applications.&lt;ref name="el" /&gt; 

The use of tracery used for geometric decoration on the exteriors can be categorised into three different styles. One style super-imposes intersecting circles around the head of the dome. A second uses small circles to punctuate and divide the dome into segments. The style is a combination of the first two, but far more complex, and uses the arcs of the circles to link the first style's looping circles with the second style's repeating patterns. Yet all of the works are similar in proportion, circumference and the size of the hinge and clasps.&lt;ref name="el"&gt;Dandridge, Peter; Ellis, Lisa.

{{Main|Prayer nut}}
The English term ''Prayer nut'' comes from the equivalent Dutch word ''gebedsnoot'', and took on common usage in the 18th century. The use of the word "nut" may be derived from the fact that some of the beads were actually carved from nuts or pits, and although no such miniatures survive, it was a known practice in medieval southern Germany.&lt;ref name="s20" /&gt; They are mostly the same shape (deliberately to resemble apples),&lt;ref&gt;Scholten (2017), p. 15&lt;/ref&gt; decorated with carved Gothic openwork tracery and flower-heads, and of a size suitable for holding in the palm of a hand.&lt;ref name="wb"&gt;Braimbridge, Mark.

''Topiarius'', Volume 14, Summer 2010. pp. 15–17. Retrieved 25 February 2017&lt;/ref&gt; 

Prayer nuts often contain central scenes depicting episodes from the life of [[Mary, mother of Jesus|Mary]] or the [[Passion of Jesus]].&lt;ref name="l80"&gt;Ellis; Suda (2016), p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Some are a single bead; more rare are those consisting of up to eleven beads, including the "[[Chatsworth House|Chatsworth]] Rosary" gifted by Henry VIII to Catherine of Aragon,&lt;ref name="l77" /&gt; which is one of only two surviving boxwood rosaries.&lt;ref name="prayer"&gt;Drake Boehm, Barbara; Suda, Alexandra.

The beads are quite uniform in size and shape, with a diameter ranging from around 30 to 65 millimetres.&lt;ref name="s27" /&gt; They were often made as two half-shells that could be opened to reveal intricate interior detail. According to the art historian Dora Thornton, when the prayer nuts was opened out, it "revealed the representation of the divine hidden inside.&lt;ref name="t162" /&gt; The art historian [[Frits Scholten]] notes that the tracery may have been intended to suggest that the object contained a small [[relic]], "so that the object took on the character of a [[talisman]] and was deemed to have an [[Apotropaic magic|apotropaic]] effect".&lt;ref name="f323"&gt;Scholten (2011), p. 323&lt;/ref&gt; A number contain a wooden loop in the middle of one half so they could be worn hanging from a belt, or carried in a case.&lt;ref name="l77"&gt;Ellis; Suda (2016), p. 77&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="t187"&gt;Thornton (1985), pp. 167, 187&lt;/ref&gt; A fragrant substance was sometimes placed inside, which diffused when the beads were used, making them comparable to the then fashionable [[pomander]]s.&lt;ref name="f323" /&gt;

The shape of a prayer nut likely carried deep significance; with the outer sheath representing Christ's human flesh; the bead stand, His cross; and the interior reliefs, His divinity.&lt;ref name="t162" /&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Freeman (1976), p. 115&lt;/ref&gt; According to Thornton, "unfolding the nut is in itself an act of prayer, like opening up a personal illuminated prayer book, or watching the leaves of a large scale altarpiece being hinged back in a church service".&lt;ref name="t186"&gt;Thornton (1985), p. 186&lt;/ref&gt; However, Scholten questions their use for private religious devotion, noting how their microscopic scale made them impractical for meditation, as their imagery was not discernible without a magnifying glass or strong spectacles.&lt;ref name="f338"&gt;Scholten (2011), p. 338&lt;/ref&gt;

===Polyptychs===
Miniature boxwood triptychs, diptychs, and other polyptychs are typically altarpieces, with [[Church tabernacle|tabernacles]] and monstrances more rare. The multi-paneled works exist in both horizontal and landscape formats, and were usually formed from a single block of wood with its components hinged together. Triptychs generally followed the format and style of their larger-scale counterparts, with a central panel with major saints and two ancillary wings.&lt;ref name="l656"&gt;Ellis; Suda (2016), pp. 65–66&lt;/ref&gt;

Wallace Collection. Retrieved 2 December 2018&lt;/ref&gt;]]
The polyptychs usually served as portable devices for laypersons, used for private devotion,&lt;ref name="w283"&gt;Wixom (1999), p. 283&lt;/ref&gt; and their popularity reflects the growing affluence of merchants living in the major northern European ports. Their iconography often follows contemporary larger scale panel altarpieces,&lt;ref name="l85"&gt;Ellis; Suda (2016), p. 85&lt;/ref&gt; with depictions of Christ Carrying the Cross, and the [[Triumphal entry into Jerusalem|Entry into Jerusalem]] as common subjects.&lt;ref name="ws171" /&gt; The altarpieces typically consist of three major elements; an architectural housing, interior reliefs, and a base or [[predella]], which may be fixed or detachable. In turn, each of these elements may have several components, which were either pinned or bound with glue.&lt;ref name="l65"&gt;Ellis; Suda (2016), p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; They usually contain folding wings, within which the miniatures are carved in low relief, and often much smaller again figures and scenes around the borders of the central pictorial space.&lt;ref name="ws172"&gt;Wetter, Scholten (2017), p. 172&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the larger fixed elements were connected with interlocking [[mortise and tenon]] joins cut into the slabs.&lt;ref name="Interior" /&gt; 

A triptych altarpiece (MMA 17.190.453) in the Metropolitan Museum of Art has a compartment (receptacle) for holding [[relic]]s which is covered by a hinged disc.&lt;ref name="l85" /&gt;&lt;ref name="prayer" /&gt; An especially detailed and complex 25.1 cm high triptych catalogued as WB.232 in the British Museum, credited to the workshop of Adam Dircksz, contains two triptychs on upper and lower registers. The upper, far larger register consists of a central panel with a background Crucifixion and numerous foreground figures; a [[Resurrection of Jesus|Resurrection]], [[Burial of Jesus|Entombment]] and other scenes are on the right-hand wing, while depictions of [[Christ Carrying the Cross]] and the [[Sacrifice of Isaac]] are the main features of the left wing.&lt;ref name="WB232" /&gt;

The reliefs are typically positioned on a horizontal plane, and allow a long space between the tops of the figures and the end of the typically rounded overhead arches.&lt;ref name="l656" /&gt; The panels are usually quite shallow, with just enough depth in the [[Niche (architecture)|niche]] to position the figures, which can be either free-standing or carved in high relief. The niches vary in profile, with 
[[dome]] or mushroom shapes being most common.&lt;ref name="l68"&gt;Ellis; Suda (2016), p. 68&lt;/ref&gt; Other features, including architectural or landscape elements, were similarly inserted fully formed; in more elaborate and detailed examples, the reduced scale was too constrained to create all of the elements in relief.&lt;ref name="Interior" /&gt; The approach also mirrors the practice employed by contemporary northern European artists working on full-scale altarpieces.&lt;ref&gt;Serck-Dewaide (1998), p. 83&lt;/ref&gt;

Many of the features of the miniatures resemble contemporary northern Gothic style architecture. Only the example, in the British Museum, contains an Italian Renaissance influence, evident in its [[baluster|baluster shafts]] and the [[pilaster]]s containing prophets on either side of the Crucifixion.&lt;ref name="m142" /&gt; The late 15th-century veneration for the [[Passion of Jesus]] and the [[Our Lady of Sorrows|Sorrows of Mary]] had a strong bearing on the design and form of many of these types of altarpieces.&lt;ref name="t189"&gt;Thornton (1985), p. 189&lt;/ref&gt; Part of the appeal of the Passion was the contrast between relatively simple scenes from the Life of Christ, juxtaposed against more complex scenes with detailed vistas, such as the Crucifixion or depictions of Heaven and Hell.&lt;ref name="t179"&gt;Thornton (1985), p. 179&lt;/ref&gt;

==Collections==
Boxwood miniatures seemed to have served three original functions: aids to private devotion, luxury objects of status, and novel playthings. Later they became precious family heirlooms, passed from generation to generation, and as medieval art fell out of fashion in the early modern period, their provenance was often lost.&lt;ref name="es94"&gt;Ellis; Suda (2016), p. 94&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest record of a collection is the 1598 inventory of the [[List of rulers of Bavaria|dukes of Bavaria]], which contain several boxwood miniatures.&lt;ref name="es934"&gt;Ellis; Suda (2016), pp. 93–94&lt;/ref&gt;

==Study and conservation==
Objects of this scale are difficult to view with the naked eye, and, even when held in hand, the true level of intricacy is not easily recognised.&lt;ref name="SuS" /&gt; The difficulty of producing magnified reproductions contributes to the fact that there has been comparatively little research into the format. Even traditional photography can fail to convey the true level of detail. Meaningful reproduction can only be achieved by computer modelling, where a series of photographs at various [[aperture|focal depths]] are [[Focus stacking|stacked]] to attain consistent sharpness.&lt;ref name="AIC" /&gt;

Modern imaging technology has greatly improved the study of the objects since the late 20th century, including the use of x-ray.&lt;ref name="CT"&gt;Ellis, Lisa; Nelson, Andrew.

'''Julie Cooper''' is a [[fictional character]] from the [[BBC]] [[soap opera]], ''[[EastEnders]]'', played by [[Louise Plowright]] from 1989–1990. The character was one of [[Mike Gibbon]]'s introductions, but she was axed in 1990 at the start of [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]]'s reign as executive producer. Julie is portrayed as a bubbly, big haired [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] girl, who has a hungry appetite for men.

== Storylines ==

===Backstory===
Julie was born in [[Walford]] then moved to [[Salford, Greater Manchester|Salford]] with her mum (who was a [[prostitute]]) as a small girl. Described as a "tough nut", who likes "a good time" but is "nobody's plaything", Julie married a man named Billy, who two-timed her and she'd subsequently vowed that no man would ever hurt her again.&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt; A further sadness involved her inability to have children, something Billy failed to be supportive about. Julie decided that she needed a new start, so she left Billy and looked into opening her own business in Walford.&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt;

===1989–1990===
In June 1989, Julie returns to Walford to sell the house (number 55 Victoria Road) left to her by her late grandmother.&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt; She leases a vacant property and employs handyman, [[Paul Priestly]] ([[Mark Thrippleton]]), and his friend, [[Trevor Short]] ([[Phil McDermott]]), to renovate it, leaving many locals wondering what sort of business Julie is intending to open. [[Dot Cotton]] ([[June Brown]]) jumps to the wrong conclusion when she sees a flier advertising Julie's "personal services" and assumes she is opening a [[brothel]]. She petitions against the opening of Julie's business, but is embarrassed when [[Ethel Skinner]] ([[Gretchen Franklin]]) — who had known Julie's mother years ago — discovers that Julie is a [[hairdresser]] and [[beautician]] and intends to open a [[Beauty salon|salon]]. The salon, named Julie's, is situated at 11 Turpin Road. [[Michelle Fowler]] ([[Susan Tully]]) becomes the salon receptionist and a young trainee named [[Marie Davies]] ([[Vivien Heilbron]]) is also employed but doesn't stay long as she regularly clashes with Julie. During her stay in Walford, Julie lives in one of the flats at 43 Albert Square.

Julie is attracted to fellow northerner Paul Priestly and, despite him dating [[Diane Butcher]] ([[Sophie Lawrence]]), she seduces him and they have sex. Their affair continues for several weeks, much to Diane's annoyance, but ends when Paul begins suspecting that Julie is using him to get a cheap deal on the work he is doing on the salon. Paul returns to Diane, but Diane cannot forgive Julie and plays various vengeful tricks, such as sabotaging the opening day of her salon and sending her a [[Male prostitution|male escort]] to make her look desperate. Julie responds by flirting with Paul to infuriate Diane, and their feud culminates in a showdown in [[The Queen Victoria]] [[public house]] one night, which leaves Diane looking the fool.

Meanwhile, Julie turns her attentions to new market trader, [[Laurie Bates]] ([[Gary Powell (actor)|Gary Powell]]), but he is more interested in [[Kathy Beale]] ([[Gillian Taylforth]]). Julie is unperturbed and flirts outrageously with Laurie at every opportunity. Laurie's relationship with Kathy does not progress the way he had hoped and Julie takes advantage – letting Laurie know that she can satisfy him in ways Kathy wouldn't. In October 1989, at the Vic's Hallowe'en party, Laurie gives in and goes home with Julie as Kathy watches. Julie assumes Laurie wants a relationship with her, but after receiving Kathy's scorn, he realises it is her he wants after all. He dumps Julie, telling her their night together was a mistake. Julie tries turning him against Kathy by telling him about her rape but only makes him more sympathetic to Kathy and they grow closer as a result.

By 1990, Julie decides that owning her own business is more trouble than it is worth. Her upmarket establishment never really takes off, not making enough money even to pay the bills. By March, Julie is facing bankruptcy and having her salon repossessed. While pondering over how to solve her money problems, she catches the eye of brothers [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant Mitchell]] ([[Steve McFadden]] and [[Ross Kemp]]). They both approach Julie but are unaware that they are trying to chat up the same woman — and Julie flirts with them both. Phil manages to secure a date with her first but opts to follow up a business deal and stands Julie up. When Grant discovers that it is Julie who Phil was supposed to meet, he goes to her flat in his brother's place. Grant manages to persuade Julie that he is a better choice than his good for nothing brother, and is eventually invited into her flat, where they share a bottle of [[wine]]. Their date goes well and Julie is so impressed that she shamelessly invites Grant to spend the night with her.

The following day, Phil meets Grant and tells him about his business meeting the night before. A [[gangster]] associate of his wants to take over the lease on Julie's salon and he wants to buy it at a vastly reduced price. Phil has been instructed to scare Julie into selling it. However, Phil realises Julie will not be so easily pushed around. Realising that he has blown his chances with her, he instructs Grant to persuade her to accept the deal. Over the coming weeks, Grant and Julie's fling continues and eventually Julie decides to sell the lease, which is when Phil moves in with his offer. While Julie is waiting to meet Grant in The Vic one night, Phil tries to persuade her to sell him the lease. Julie realises that the Mitchell brothers have been using her, and she throws a drink in Phil's face and threatens to castrate Grant when he also tries to coax her into selling.

Despite her hostility towards the Mitchell brothers, Julie still wants to sell the lease and is forced to do business with them, but in [[revenge]], insists on £1000 more than Grant originally offered. Grant agrees reluctantly and the Mitchells lose their cut of the payment from their associate. After securing her victory, Julie closes her salon and returns to Salford in March 1990.

== Creation and development ==
Writer [[Colin Brake]] has suggested that 1989 was a year of big change for ''EastEnders'', both behind the cameras and in front of them. Original production designer, Keith Harris, left the show, and co-creators, [[Tony Holland]] and [[Julia Smith]], both decided that the time had come to move on too; their final contribution coinciding with the exit of one of ''EastEnders'' most successful characters, [[Den Watts]] ([[Leslie Grantham]]).&lt;ref name="first10years"&gt;{{cite book |last=Brake|first= Colin|authorlink= Colin Brake|title= [[EastEnders spin-offs#Non-fiction books|EastEnders: The First 10 Years: A Celebration]] |year=1995|publisher=BBC Books|isbn=0-563-37057-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; Producer, [[Mike Gibbon]], was given the task of running the show and he enlisted the most experienced writers to take over the storylining of the programme, including Charlie Humphreys, Jane Hollowood and [[Tony McHale]].&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

According to Brake, the departure of two of the soap's most popular characters, Den and [[Angie Watts]] ([[Anita Dobson]]), had left a void in the programme, which needed to be filled.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; In addition several other long-running characters left the show that year including two original cast members, [[Sue Osman|Sue]] and [[Ali Osman]] ([[Sandy Ratcliff]] and [[Nejdet Salih]]) and their family; [[Donna Ludlow]] ([[Matilda Ziegler]]); [[Carmel Jackson]] ([[Judith Jacob]]) and [[Colin Russell (EastEnders)|Colin Russell]] ([[Michael Cashman]]). Brake has indicated that the production team decided that 1989 was to be a year of change in Walford, commenting, "it was almost as if Walford itself was making a fresh start".&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

At the time the programme had come under criticism in the British media for being too [[Depression (mood)|depressing]], and according to Brake, the programme makers were determined to change this.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; In 1989 there was a deliberate attempt to increase the lighter, more comic aspects of life in [[Albert Square]]. This led to the introduction of some characters who were deliberately conceived as comic or light-hearted.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; Such characters included Julie Cooper; [[Marge Green]] — a batty older lady played by veteran comedy actress, [[Pat Coombs]]; [[Trevor Short]] ([[Phil McDermott]]), the "village idiot", and his friend, northern heartbreaker [[Paul Priestly]] ([[Mark Thrippleton]]); wheeler-dealer [[Vince Johnson]] ([[Hepburn Graham]]) and [[Laurie Bates]] ([[Gary Powell (actor)|Gary Powell]]), who became [[Pete Beale]]'s ([[Peter Dean (actor)|Peter Dean]]) sparring partner.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

Julie Cooper has been described by author Hilary Kingsley as "a man-mad insatiable flirt, bubbly with a comic but shrewd persona." She was scripted to be sassy but streetwise and she brought "a touch of [[North of England|northern]] culture to the programme".&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"&gt;{{cite book |last= Kingsley|first= Hilary|title= The EastEnders Handbook |year=1990|publisher=BBC books|isbn=0-685-52957-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The relatively unknown [[Lancashire]] [[actress]] [[Louise Plowright]] was eventually cast in the role. The casting director was initially dubious about giving her the role, as Plowright, then thirty-three, didn't look "old enough or tough enough to play this serious man eater".&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt; In an interview given in Hilary Kingsley's [[EastEnders books|''EastEnders'' Handbook]], Plowright comments: "I really played up the [[Bette Midler]] act...That did it."&lt;ref name="EEHandbook"/&gt;

Brake suggests that humour was an important element in ''EastEnders''' storylines during 1989, with a greater amount of slapstick and light comedy than ever before. He has classed 1989's changes  as a brave experiment, and has suggested that while some found this period of ''EastEnders'' entertaining, many other viewers felt that the comedy stretched the programme's credibility somewhat.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; Although the programme still covered many issues in 1989, such as [[domestic violence]], drugs, [[rape]] and [[racism]], Brake reflected that the new emphasis on a more balanced mix between "light and heavy storylines" gave the illusion that the show had lost a "certain edge".&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt;

By the end of the year ''EastEnders'' had acquired a new executive producer, [[Michael Ferguson (director)|Michael Ferguson]], who had previously been a successful producer on [[ITV Network|ITV]]'s ''[[The Bill]]''. Brake has suggested that Ferguson was responsible for bringing in a new sense of vitality, and creating a programme that was more in touch with the real world than it had been over the last year.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; A new era began in 1990 with the introduction of the Mitchell brothers, [[Phil Mitchell|Phil]] ([[Steve McFadden]]) and [[Grant Mitchell (EastEnders)|Grant]] ([[Ross Kemp]]), successful characters who would go on to dominate the soap thereafter. As the new production machine cleared the way for new characters and a new direction, a number of characters were axed from the show at the start of the year.&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; Among them was Julie, as well as many other characters that had been introduced to the show in 1989. By March 1990 they had all gone. Several of the actors were upset to be leaving the programme so soon, but with the show's new direction there was no place for characters "whose prime function was to be comic relief".&lt;ref name="first10years"/&gt; Louise Plowright has since revealed that she would have liked to have stayed with the soap longer, but that the split was an amicable one. She commented, "They just didn't know where to go with the character."&lt;ref name="programme"&gt;{{cite book |last=Munroe|first=Josephine|title= The EastEnders Programme Guide |year=1994|publisher=Virgin Books|isbn=0-86369-825-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''Lampsacus Treasure''' or ''Lapseki Treasure'' is the name of an important early [[Byzantine]] silver hoard found near the town of [[Lapseki]] (ancient Lampsacus) in modern-day Turkey.  Most of the hoard is now in the [[British Museum]]'s collection, although a few items can be found in museums in [[Paris]] and [[Istanbul]] too.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.britishmuseum.org/research/collection_online/search.aspx?place=27676&amp;plaA=27676-3-2 British Museum Collection]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Discovery==
The Lampsacus Treasure was accidentally found in 1847 by famers digging in a field near the village of Lapseki (ancient [[Lampsacus]]) in north-west Turkey. Dating to 6th and 7th centuries AD, the hoard of largely silver objects provides a significant catalogue of design and fashion from the early [[Byzantine]] period. Soon after its discovery, the bulk of the treasure came into the possession of [[Henry Richard Charles Wellesley]], Earl of Cowley, who donated it to the [[British Museum]] in 1848. Two other institutions also have objects from the treasure: the [[Istanbul Archaeological Museum]] possess two bowls; the [[Louvre]] a further two spoons.

==Description of the treasure==
The [[hoard]] includes a wide range of [[ecclesiastical]] objects that may have originally belonged to a church or a wealthy individual connected with the church. It includes a silver tripod lamp-stand with five imperial control stamps that date from the reign of [[Justinian I]] (527-65AD). In the British Museum there are also twelve pear-shaped spoons, six of which bear inscriptions and verse in Greek and/or Latin, a (slightly damaged) silver [[chalice]], two silver dishes with [[niello]]ed [[monograms]] in the centre, an ornate silver polycandelon, part of a folding stool, and various jewellery and furniture/vessel fittings.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="403">'''Lapidary style''' is prose that is appropriate for memorials, mausoleums, stelae, and other commemorations in which words are "etched in stone"; it is concise, pithy, elegant, and sententious.  The meaning extends to text in that style which is printed on paper rather than carved into monuments.

'''Leonard Digges''' ({{IPAc-en|d|ɪ|g|z}}; 1588 &amp;ndash; 7 April 1635) was an accomplished [[Hispanist]] and minor poet,&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;{{DNB Cite|wstitle=Digges, Leonard (1588-1635)}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;S.H. Steinberg, "Digges, Leonard," in: ''Cassell's Encyclopedia of World Literature,'' New York: Funk &amp; Wagnalls, 1953.&lt;/ref&gt; a younger son of the astronomer [[Thomas Digges]] (1545&amp;ndash;95, and younger brother of Sir [[Dudley Digges]] (1583&amp;ndash;1639). After his father's death in 1595, his mother married Thomas Russell of Alderminster,&lt;ref&gt;A village about four miles south of Stratford.&lt;/ref&gt; who was named by [[William Shakespeare]] as one of the two overseers of his will.  There are varying opinions about the extent to which the young Leonard Digges might have been influenced in his choice of profession by his stepfather's association with Shakespeare; disagreements about whether he was or was not personally acquainted with the playwright have in recent years eclipsed discussion of the work of Digges himself.

==Life==
Leonard Digges matriculated at [[University College, Oxford]] in 1603, the year of his mother's remarriage, and graduated BA in 1606.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;  This was followed by a period of study abroad.  He may have traveled to Spain with fellow Hispanist [[James Mabbe]], whom he knew from Oxford, for he wrote a note on the flyleaf of a book which Mabbe sent from Madrid to Will Baker, also a friend from Oxford days.  The book was a copy of ''Rimas'' by [[Lope de Vega]] (published in 1613); it still survives, in the library of [[Balliol College]].  Digges's inscription reads:

::Will Baker: Knowinge
::that M&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt; Mab: was to
::sende you this Booke
::of sonets, w&lt;sup&gt;ch&lt;/sup&gt; with Spaniards
::here is accounted of their
::lope de Vega as in Englande
::wee sholde of o&lt;sup&gt;r&lt;/sup&gt;: Will
::Shakespeare. I colde not
::but insert thus much to
::you, that if you like
::him not, you muste neuer
::neuer reade Spanishe Poet
:::::Leo:Digges&lt;ref&gt;Paul Morgan, [https://books.google.com/books?id=ws1SAlRJ-Y8C&amp;pg=PA118&amp;lpg=PA118#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false "'Our Will Shakespeare' and Lope de Vega: An Unrecorded Contemporary Document,"] in Allardyce Nicoll (ed.),''Shakespeare Survey,'' 16,Cambridge University Press, 2002 reprint, pp.118-120: Samuel Schoenbaum, ''William Shakespeare: a compact documentary life,'' ibid.p.313&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

[[Anthony Wood (antiquary)|Anthony a Wood]] said of Leonard Digges that he "was esteemed by those who knew him in Univ.coll. a great master of the English language, a perfect understander of the French and Spanish, a good poet, and no mean orator."&lt;ref&gt;Wood, Anthony, [https://archive.org/stream/athenaeoxoniense02wooduoft/athenaeoxoniense02wooduoft_djvu.txt ''Athenae Oxonienses: an Exact History of all the Writers and Bishops who have had their Education in the University of Oxford from 1500 to 1690''], published in London in 1692.&lt;/ref&gt;  Wood says also that "upon his supplication made to the venerable convocation" of University College Oxford, Digges was made M.A. in 1626, "in consideration that he had spent many years in good letters in transmarine universities."  He lived in the College from then until his death in 1635, and was buried in the College chapel (no longer standing).

==Works==
Digges translated [[Claudian]]'s ''The Rape of Proserpine'' (printed [[1617 in literature|1617]]). His translation of ''Varia fortuna de soldado Píndaro'' by [[Gonzalo de Céspedes y Meneses]], was published in [[1622 in literature|1622]] as  ''Gerardo, the Unfortunate Spaniard'', and was used by [[John Fletcher (playwright)|John Fletcher]] as a source for his plays ''[[The Spanish Curate]]'' and ''[[The Maid in the Mill]]''.

Digges's publisher was [[Edward Blount]], a close friend of Mabbe's and one of the syndicate which published Shakespeare's [[First Folio]] in 1623.  Digges and Mabbe both contributed prefatory poems to the Folio, as did [[Ben Jonson]]—also published by Blount.  The previous year, Digges and Jonson had both contributed [[commendatory verse]]s to a work translated by Mabbe and published by Blount.&lt;ref name=Freehafer&gt;Freehafer, John, "Leonard Digges, Ben Johnson, and the Beginning of Shakespeare Idolatry", ''Shakespeare Quarterly'', Vol. 21, No. 1 (Winter, 1970), pp. 63-75&lt;/ref&gt; Commendatory verses by Digges were also included in an edition of Shakespeare's ''Poems'', published by [[John Benson (publisher)|John Benson]] in 1640, five years after Digges had died.  Freehafer suggests that since these verses refer to Shakespeare's plays rather than to his poems, they may have been intended for the Second Folio.&lt;ref name=Freehafer/&gt;

==Plot==
Lorna Cole ([[Rene Russo]]) is pregnant with [[Los Angeles Police Department|LAPD]] Sergeant Martin Riggs' baby; they are not married, but both are thinking about it. LAPD Sergeant Roger Murtaugh's daughter Rianne (Tracie Wolfe), is also pregnant, though he is not told the child is with Detective Lee Butters (Chris Rock) since he did not want his daughter to marry a police officer. Due to issues with the department's insurance carrier over Riggs and Murtaugh's actions as sergeants, Captain Murphy (Steve Kahan) promotes them to captains.

The officers along with Leo Getz (Joe Pesci) come upon a [[Han Chinese|Chinese]] immigrant smuggling ring after running an ocean-going vessel aground. The captain of the boat escapes. In the subsequent investigation, Murtaugh finds Hong (Eddy Ko) and his family hiding from US Immigration officers to avoid deportation. Murtaugh offers them shelter in his home, and their families, along with Riggs and Cole, quickly bond. Hong reveals he is looking for his uncle, a skilled engraver, who had paid for their passage to the United States.

Continued investigation of the smuggling ring leads the officers to "Uncle" Benny Chan, a crime boss operating from a [[Chinatown]] restaurant. There, they are introduced to high-ranking [[Triad (underground society)|Triad]] negotiator Wah Sing Ku (Jet Li). Chan forces them out of his restaurant when the officers show no probable cause. Outside, Riggs spots the escaped captain and tries to give chase but fails to capture him. However, Ku later intercepts the captain and kills him as punishment for attracting the police's attention. Chan and Ku take steps to eliminate all those in on their plans.

Hong is able to contact his uncle, but this leads the Triads to Murtaugh's house. Ku and the Triad thugs kidnap the Hongs, tie up Murtaugh, his family, Riggs and Cole and set the house ablaze. Ping, Hong's grandson, has evaded capture and helps to free the others in time. Though Riggs and Murtaugh chase down and kill some of the Triad, Ku escapes. Ku brings Hong to his uncle at a warehouse, where he has been engraving plates for a counterfeiting operation for Ku and Chan in exchange for transit for his family. Ku kills Hong in front of his uncle to assure his continued work.

The officers attempt to shake Chan for more information, but are unable to get any leads until they discuss what they know with Detective Ng (Calvin Jung), who has worked on cases involving the Chinese government before. Ng recognizes that Ku must be trying to negotiate with a corrupt Chinese general for the release of the Four Fathers, high-ranking Triad members that include Ku's brother (Conan Lee). New information leads them to the abandoned warehouse where they find the bodies of Hong, his uncle, and Chan, the latter two killed by Ku after they served their usefulness. Knowing that Ku plans to use counterfeit money, the police intercept the exchange between Ku and the general, telling the general the money is fake. A firefight breaks out between the Triad, the general's private army and the police, and most of the Triad and army are killed. Ku attempts to escape with his brother, but his brother is shot and killed by Murtaugh. Riggs and Murtaugh pursue Ku to a pier where they engage him in a brutal fistfight. Murtaugh impales Ku through the stomach before the pier collapses and sends Riggs and Ku into the water. Riggs is able to find a [[AK-47|Kalashnikov]] assault rifle and finish Ku, while Murtaugh arrives in time to help rescue Riggs from a piece of concrete that had pinned him underwater.

Later, Riggs visits his dead wife's grave and asks her for advice about his impending marriage with Lorna, about which he still has doubts; Getz arrives and offers a childhood story that gives Riggs a new light on the situation. They learn Lorna is about to give birth and race to the hospital, where Riggs and Lorna are ceremonially married by a [[rabbi]] just before she enters labor. Their son and Rianne's daughter are born, and Murtaugh accepts Butters as his son-in-law. Murphy gives Riggs and Murtaugh their rank of Sergeant back since the city is insured again and Hong's family is granted [[right of asylum|asylum]].

===Box office===
''Lethal Weapon 4'' debuted at {{Abbr|No.|Number}} 1 at the box office.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Action-Hero Films Have $70-Million Blast; Box office: 'Lethal 4' opens at No. 1, 'Soldiers' in third, as 'Armageddon' stays solid.|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 13, 1998|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jul/13/entertainment/ca-3234|accessdate=December 7, 2010|first=Richard|last=Natale}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the film grossed $130 million in the U.S., it was not considered a runaway financial success as the previous three films had been.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= 'Lethal' Has a Winning Formula|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 14, 1998|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jul/14/entertainment/ca-3440|accessdate=September 11, 2010|first=Robert W.|last=Welkos}}&lt;/ref&gt; Shooting began in January 1998, just months before the film's release, with a production budget estimated at $120–$150 million (although [[Warner Bros.]] maintained it cost less than $100 million)&lt;ref name="Wolk (1998)"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.ew.com/ew/article/0,,83595,00.html |title=Lethal Weapon 4 |author=Josh Wolk |date=July 13, 1998 |work=Entertainment Weekly |accessdate=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an additional $50 million spent on marketing and distribution.&lt;ref name="Natale (1998)"&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jul/14/business/fi-3512 |title=Lethal Comes Out Shooting but Stars Will Drain Profit |author=Richard Natala |date=July 14, 1998 |work=Los Angeles Times |accessdate=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; This made the fourth film the most expensive entry of the series. Its profit margin was saved in part due to the combined foreign box office sales making the film gross approximately $285 million in total,&lt;ref name=mojo&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.boxofficemojo.com/movies/?id=lethalweapon4.htm |title=Lethal Weapon 4 |publisher=boxofficemojo.com |accessdate=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; making the second highest-grossing film in the ''Lethal Weapon'' film series behind, ''[[Lethal Weapon 3]]'' (1992). Still, like its predecessors, ''Lethal Weapon 4'' was among the top ten grossing films of its release year.

===Reception===
Critical reaction to ''Lethal Weapon 4'' was mixed.&lt;ref name="Weapon' Of Mass Appeal"&gt;{{cite news|title= `Weapon' Of Mass Appeal|work=Chicago Tribune|date=July 10, 1998|url= http://articles.chicagotribune.com/1998-07-10/entertainment/9807100003_1_martin-riggs-gibson-and-glover-sequels|accessdate=September 12, 2010|first=Michael|last=Wilmington}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Automatic 'Weapon'|work=Los Angeles Times|date=July 10, 1998|url= http://articles.latimes.com/1998/jul/10/entertainment/ca-2255|accessdate=September 11, 2010|first=Kenneth|last=Turan}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|title= Film review; Bones Crunch?

[[James Berardinelli]] gave the film three stars out of four, writing: "Given the expectations that constrain it, ''Lethal Weapon 4'' is probably the best motion picture that could possibly result from another teaming of Martin Riggs and Roger Murtaugh. The series has lost a lot of steam since the first two entries, and, although the fourth movie ratchets up the energy level from the moribund state of the disappointing ''Lethal Weapon 3'', there's no sense of spontaneity."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://preview.reelviews.net/movies/l/lethal4.html |title=Lethal Weapon 4 |author=James Berardinelli |work=Film review |publisher=reelviews.net |accessdate=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Roger Ebert]] gave ''Lethal Weapon 4'' two stars out of four, writing: "''Lethal Weapon 4'' has all the technical skill of the first three movies in the series, but lacks the secret weapon, which was conviction. All four movies take two cop buddies and put them into spectacular and absurd action sequences, but the first three at least went through the motions of taking the plot seriously (and the first one did such a good job, it made my 'best 10' list of that year). This time, we're watching an exercise."&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |url=http://rogerebert.suntimes.com/apps/pbcs.dll/article?AID=/19980710/REVIEWS/807100303/1023 |title=Lethal Weapon 4 |date=July 10, 1998 |work=Reviews |publisher=rogerebert.com |accessdate=September 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;  Michael O'Sullivan of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called it a "stupid and violent delicacy" that balances a "patented blend of high action and low comedy".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.washingtonpost.com/wp-srv/style/longterm/movies/videos/lethalweapon4osullivan.htm|title= Another Day, Another 'Lethal Weapon'|last=O'Sullivan|first=Michael|work=[[The Washington Post]]|date=1998-07-10|accessdate=2014-12-13}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This was the only film in the series not to have a soundtrack album released alongside it, but in 2013 La-La Land Records released the score as discs seven and eight of its limited edition ''Lethal Weapon Soundtrack Collection''.

'''Little Daylight''' is a [[fairy tale]] written by [[George MacDonald]] and included as a [[story within a story]] in ''[[At the Back of the North Wind]]'', published in 1871.  It has subsequently been published as an independent tale, and in collections of his other fairy tales.

==Synopsis==
A king and queen gain a daughter, whom they name Daylight. They invite all the [[fairy|fairies]] who live in the woods by their palace, except one, newly arrived, who lives in the swamp and has everyone convinced she is a [[witch]].

The fairy arrives anyway, and demands the baby's name. On hearing it is "Little Daylight" she says it shall be little daylight, as the princess would sleep all day. Another fairy gives her the gift of waking all night, but the swamp fairy insists that she was not done with the curse, and that Daylight shall wax and wane with the moon. A second fairy says that the curse shall be broken when a prince kisses her without knowing it, and the swamp fairy can not pretend again that she was not done.   As the princess grows up, she is beautiful and full of high spirits at the full moon, and as it wanes, turns wan and withered, as if sickly. The older she grows the more extreme the contrast becomes. 

A nearby prince has to flee a revolt in his country and comes to the woods.  He meets a fairy who is very cryptic with him, and then comes across Daylight dancing in the woods by moonlight. He sees her three nights in a row, as the moon is waxing to full, and falls in love.  The third night, they have a conversation in which the princess tells him she has never seen the sun. He meets the fairy again and talks with her, but the fairy can not tell him the full curse.

The swamp fairy discovers his presence and prevents him from finding her again until the moon is more than half gone; then, she thinks the withered princess will not attract him, so she relaxes her guard. The prince finds Daylight again when the moon is new, and she is so withered and feeble that he spends the night trying to minister to her, and when carrying her to help, kisses her. Dawn arrives, Daylight is restored to her full beauty, and she asks the prince whether the sun is coming.

[[File:Littlewars.jpg|thumb|The cover of ''Little Wars'']]

'''''Little Wars''''' is a set of rules for playing with [[toy soldier]]s, written by English novelist [[H. G. Wells]] in 1913. The book, which had a full title of  '''''Little Wars: a game for boys from twelve years of age to one hundred and fifty and for that more intelligent sort of girl who likes boys' games and books''''', provided simple rules for [[miniature wargaming]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Rundle|first1=Michael|title=How HG Wells Invented Modern War Games 100 Years Ago|url=http://www.huffingtonpost.co.uk/2013/04/09/hg-wells-little-wars-how-_n_3044934.html|work=The Huffington Post|date=9 April 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although first printed in 1913, an updated version was released in 2004.

== Contents ==

''Little Wars'' included fairly simple rules for [[infantry]], [[cavalry]], and [[artillery]] in the form of a toy [[4.7 inch gun]] that launched projectiles, usually small wooden [[dowel]]s to knock down enemy soldiers. In addition to its being a war game, the book hints at several philosophical aspects of [[war]].

The book is written in a whimsical style and illustrated with amusing drawings and photographs of a game being played that Wells describes in the book. Wells also gives a description of the game from the view of one of the generals in the battle bombastically relating his memoirs.

== Development ==
[[File:HG Wells playing to Little Wars.jpg|thumb|upright=1.5|H. G. Wells playing a wargame with [[W. Britain]] [[toy soldier]]s according to the rules of ''Little Wars''.  Wells is using a piece of string cut to a set length of the distance his soldiers can move.  An [[umpire]] sits in a chair with his [[stopwatch]] timing Wells.  Wells' opponent waits for his turn to move and fire his cannon at Wells' soldiers.]]

The development of the game is explained and Wells's thoughts on war, as he was known to be a [[pacifism|pacifist]], are revealed in his writing. According to Wells, the idea of the game developed from a visit by his friend [[Jerome K. Jerome]].  After dinner, Jerome began shooting down [[toy soldier]]s with a toy cannon and Wells joined in to compete. The two decided that with an addition of written rules, a good [[Kriegsspiel (wargame)|Kriegsspiel]] type game could be developed.  The game revolved around the use of lead [[Permanent mold casting#Slush|hollow cast]] soldiers made by [[Britains|W. Britain]] and battlefields made from whatever materials were on hand, usually blocks or other toys. Simple rules of movement, firing, and [[close combat]] were developed with a set amount of time for each player to move and fire. Wells also provides a chapter of "Extensions and Amplifications of Little War". In an appendix, Wells provides "Little Wars and Kriegspiel"; more complex rules to be played in a larger space involving [[military logistics]], [[Military engineering|military engineers]], [[Charge (warfare)#Cavalry charges|cavalry charges]], and [[Military railways|railway transport of troops]].

== Publication ==

''Little Wars'' was first published in 1913 by Frank Palmer.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Palmer|first1=Frank|title=Little Wars. By H. G. Wells.|url=http://archive.spectator.co.uk/article/16th-august-1913/24/little-wars-by-h-g-wells-frank-palmer-2s-6d|work=The Spectator|date=16 Aug 1913}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Little Wars'' was republished in its unabridged form by [[Da Capo Press]] in 1977.&lt;ref name="SG"/&gt; There have been numerous other reprints and it is now available online at [[Project Gutenberg]], along with a previous game book by Wells called ''[[Floor Games]]'' (1911). A 2004 edition of the book published by [[Skirmisher Publishing]] includes an introduction by game designer [[Michael O. Varhola]] and a foreword by [[Gary Gygax]].

==Reception==
C. Ben Ostrander reviewed the 1977 unabridged version of ''Little Wars'' in ''[[The Space Gamer]]'' No. 17.&lt;ref name="SG"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Ostrander|first=C. Ben |date=May–June 1978 |title=Books|journal=[[The Space Gamer]]|publisher=[[Metagaming Concepts|Metagaming]]|issue=17|pages=21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Ostrander commented that "There are many line drawings and photos of the author 'at play'. Although it is of little use to the modern gamer, this book stands as an interesting volume."&lt;ref name="SG"/&gt;

'''Marion Bessie Terry''' (13 October 1853 – 21 August 1930) was an English actress.  In a career spanning half a century, she played leading roles in more than 125 plays.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.time.com/time/magazine/article/0,9171,740213-2,00.html Obituary] ''Time Magazine'', 1 September 1930&lt;/ref&gt; Always in the shadow of her older and more famous sister [[Ellen Terry|Ellen]], Terry nevertheless achieved considerable success in the plays of [[W. S. Gilbert]], [[Oscar Wilde]], [[Henry James]] and others.

==Biography==
Terry was born in England, into a theatrical family.  Her birth name was '''Mary Ann Bessy Terry''', and she was nicknamed "Polly".&lt;ref name=DNB&gt;Booth, Michael R. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/38758, "Terry, Marion Bessie (1853–1930)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press (2004), accessed 7 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Her parents, Benjamin (1818–1896), of Irish descent, and Sarah (née Ballard) (1819–1892), of Scottish ancestry, were comic actors in a touring company based in [[Portsmouth]]&lt;ref name=SB&gt;[http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.stagebeauty.net/terry/terry-e2.html Biography of Ellen Terry at the Stage Beauty website]&lt;/ref&gt; (where Sarah's father was a Wesleyan minister) and had eleven children.  At least five of these became actors: [[Kate Terry|Kate]], [[Ellen Terry|Ellen]], Marion, Florence and [[Fred Terry|Fred]].&lt;ref&gt;Booth, Michael R. [http://www.oxforddnb.com/view/article/36460 "Terry, Dame Ellen Alice (1847–1928)",] ''Oxford Dictionary of National Biography'', Oxford University Press, September 2004; online edn, January 2008, accessed 4 January 2010&lt;/ref&gt; Two other children, George and Charles, were connected with theatre management.&lt;ref&gt;Hartnoll, pp. 815–17.&lt;/ref&gt;

Terry's sister Kate was a very successful actress until her marriage and retirement from the stage in 1867, and her sister Ellen became the greatest Shakespearean actress of her time.  Her great nephew (Kate's grandson), Sir [[John Gielgud]], became one of the twentieth century's most respected actors.&lt;ref name=Answers&gt;[http://www.answers.com/topic/ellen-terry Terry Biography at Answers.com]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://encyclopedia.farlex.com/Terry,+Dame+(Alice)+Ellen Hutchinson encyclopedia article on Terry family]&lt;/ref&gt; Terry attended a boarding-school for girls at Sunnyside, [[Kingston upon Thames]], together with her favourite sister, Florence.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

===Career===
Terry's first professional stage appearance was in July 1873 as Ophelia in a production of ''[[Hamlet]]'' directed by [[Tom Taylor]] in Manchester.  Her first West End appearance came in October 1873 as Isabelle in a farce by [[John Maddison Morton]], ''A Game of Romps'' at the [[Olympic Theatre]], in the company of [[Henry Gartside Neville|Henry Neville]].  This was followed by the role of Lady Valeria in Morton's ''All that Glitters Is Not Gold'' at the same theatre.  In 1874, she was Hero in [[Shakespeare]]'s ''[[Much Ado about Nothing]]'' at the Olympic.  She then played a season at the [[Royal Strand Theatre|Strand Theatre]], and in 1875 appeared in ''Weak Woman'' by [[H. J. Byron]].

[[File:MarionTerry1882.JPG|left|thumb|Marion Terry, c. 1880]]
Terry next joined the company at the [[Haymarket Theatre]] and became a protege of [[W. S. Gilbert]],&lt;ref name=Stedman158&gt;Stedman, p. 158&lt;/ref&gt; soon appearing in several of his plays, including ''[[Dan'l Druce, Blacksmith]]'' (1876) as Dorothy,&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 123&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Palace of Truth]]'' (1876 revival),&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 125&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[Pygmalion and Galatea (play)|Pygmalion and Galatea]]'' (1877 revival) and ''[[Engaged (play)|Engaged]]'' (1877), creating the role of Belinda Treherne with great success.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt; Also during that period, she first appeared in ''The Danischeffs'' by Lord Newry (1876), ''Fame'' by C. M. Rae (1877), ''Charles XII'' by [[James Planché]] (1877 revival),&lt;ref&gt;Adams, p. 274&lt;/ref&gt; ''[[The Ne'er-do-Weel|The Vagabond]]'', by Gilbert (1878),&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 150&lt;/ref&gt; ''Two Orphans'' (1878),&lt;ref&gt;Ainger, p. 164&lt;/ref&gt; ''The Crushed Tragedian'',&lt;ref name=Stedman158/&gt; and ''My Little Girl'' by [[Dion Boucicault]].  In 1879 she moved to the [[Prince of Wales's Theatre]] under the management of [[Squire Bancroft|the Bancrofts]] and then moved with the company to the Haymarket, performing in revivals of [[T. W. Robertson]]'s comedies, including as Blanche Haye in ''Ours'' and Bella in ''School''.  In 1879 she also appeared as Mabel in ''Duty'' by James Albert and the title role in ''[[Gretchen (play)|Gretchen]]'' by Gilbert.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

Now an established actress, Terry continued to play leading roles in contemporary plays.  She was Bathsheba in the stage adaptation of ''[[Far from the Madding Crowd]]'' by [[Thomas Hardy]] and [[J. Comyns Carr]] (1882).  The same year, she starred with [[Lottie Venne]] and [[Johnston Forbes-Robertson]] in G. W. Godfrey's comedy ''The Parvenu'' at the [[Royal Court Theatre|Court Theatre]].&lt;ref&gt;Culme, John. [http://footlightnotes.tripod.com/20050305home.html Footlight Notes No. 389] at Footlightnotes.tripod.com, accessed 18 November 2009&lt;/ref&gt; She substituted for her sister Ellen, who was ill, as Viola in ''[[Twelfth Night]]'' at the [[Lyceum Theatre, London|Lyceum Theatre]] in 1884.  In 1885 she played in ''The Magistrate'' by [[Arthur Wing Pinero]].  In 1887, she joined the company of [[Herbert Beerbohm Tree]] first at the [[Comedy Theatre]] and then at the Haymarket.  That year, she also appeared in ''The Ballad-Monger'', by Walter Bessant.  In February 1888, she starred in a revival of Gilbert's ''[[Broken Hearts]]''.&lt;ref&gt;[http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas/other_gilbert/broken_hearts/intro.html Introduction to ''Broken Hearts''] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20080829120846/http://diamond.boisestate.edu/gas//other_gilbert/broken_hearts/intro.html |date=29 August 2008 }}, The Gilbert and Sullivan Archive&lt;/ref&gt; Later that year, she toured the British provinces with [[Henry Irving]] in another of her sister Ellen's roles, Margaret in ''Faust''.  She played Mrs. Erroll in ''The Real Little Lord Fauntleroy'' (1889),&lt;ref&gt;Foulkes, p. 98&lt;/ref&gt; appeared in ''Cyrene'' by Alfred C. Calmour (1890), and appeared in 1891 in  ''Sunlight and Shadow'' by R. C. Carton.  She continued to tour with Irving's Lyceum company in the 1890s, as Rosamund in [[Alfred Lord Tennyson]]'s ''Becket'', as Portia in ''[[The Merchant of Venice]]'' (one of her sister's signature roles), and again as Margaret.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

===Later years===
[[File:GilbertinRosencrantz.jpg|thumb|right|Terry and [[W. S. Gilbert]] in ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (Gilbert)|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]'']]
In 1892 Terry played perhaps her most famous role, Mrs. Erlynne in ''[[Lady Windermere's Fan]]'', by [[Oscar Wilde]], at the [[St James's Theatre]].  This was followed by Hetty in ''The Cotton King'' by Sutton Vane Sr. (1893).  In 1895, she appeared in ''Alabama'' by [[Augustus Thomas]], in the title role in ''Delia Harding'' by [[J. Comyns Carr]], and as Mrs. Peverel in ''[[Guy Domville]]'' by [[Henry James]].  In 1900 she played the roles of Rosalind and Portia at the Stratford festival.  She was Nina in ''Forgiveness'' by J. Comyns Carr (1901), the title role in ''Eleanor'' by [[Mary Augusta Ward|Mrs. Humphrey Ward]] (1902), Susan Throssell in ''[[Quality Street (play)|Quality Street]]'' by [[J. M. Barrie]] (1902), and Audrie in ''Michael and His Lost Angel'' by [[Henry Arthur Jones]], among many other engagements.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

In 1907, Terry performed in a [[Royal Command Performance]] of the 1855 [[Tom Taylor]] play, ''Still Waters Run Deep'', together with [[Charles Wyndham (actor)|Charles Wyndham]], before [[King Edward VII]].&lt;ref name=stage&gt;Gillan, Don. [http://www.stagebeauty.net/th-frames.html?http&amp;&amp;&amp;www.stagebeauty.net/th-commnd.html A History of the Royal Command Performance], StageBeauty.net, accessed 16 June 2009&lt;/ref&gt; She played Hamlet's mother in a 1908 revival of Gilbert's parody of ''Hamlet'', ''[[Rosencrantz and Guildenstern (Gilbert)|Rosencrantz and Guildenstern]]''.  She toured in America and Canada in 1908 and 1909.  Her last role was the Principessa della Cercola in ''Our Betters at the Globe'' by [[Somerset Maugham]] in 1923, fifty years after her first professional appearance.  Suffering from arthritis and other ailments, she retired from the stage.  In her last years, Terry lived in [[Paddington]], after having lived for many years at Buckingham Palace Mansions.&lt;ref name=Timesobit&gt;Obituary, ''The Times'', 22 August 1930&lt;/ref&gt;

Terry died at her home in 1930, aged 76, of a cerebral haemorrhage and was buried at St Albans cemetery.&lt;ref name=Timesobit/&gt; She never married and, intensely private offstage, nothing is known of her romantic life.  She left an estate of more than £12,000.&lt;ref name=DNB/&gt;

'''''Murray's Family Library''''' was a series of non-fiction works published from 1829 to 1834, by [[John Murray (1778–1843)|John Murray]], in 51 volumes. The series editor was [[John Gibson Lockhart]], who also wrote the first book, a biography of [[Napoleon]].&lt;ref name="JGL"&gt;{{cite DNB|wstitle=Lockhart, John Gibson|volume=34}}&lt;/ref&gt; The books were priced at five [[shilling]]s;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Robert A.

The '''Orchestre symphonique de Québec''' (OSQ; English, Quebec Symphony Orchestra) is a Canadian symphony [[orchestra]] based in [[Quebec City]].  Founded in 1902 as the Société symphonique de Québec, the OSQ is the oldest active Canadian orchestra.  Joseph Vézina was the OSQ's first music director, from 1902 to 1924. In 1942 the orchestra merged with rival orchestra Cercle philharmonique de Québec (founded 1936), at which time it changed its name to the Orchestre Symphonique de Québec.

The orchestra holds an annual competition for young [[Quebec]] musicians awarding monetary prizes as well as the opportunity to perform as a soloist with the orchestra. The orchestra also performs with the Théâtre lyrique du Québec (Théâtre lyrique de Nouvelle-France), the (defunct) Opéra du Québec, the Opéra de Québec, and the Choeur symphonique de Québec.

The most recent Canadian music director of the OSQ was Françoys Bernier from 1966-1968. The most recent music director was [[Yoav Talmi]], from 1998 to 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news | author=Arthur Kaptainis | title=There's no shortage of Canadian talent to succeed Talmi as musical director of Quebec City orchestra | url=http://www2.canada.com/montrealgazette/columnists/story.html?id=40a6b362-8608-43d4-a6d4-adeb32b95ce3 | work=Montreal Gazette | date=3 April 2010 | accessdate=2010-04-06}}&lt;/ref&gt;  In December 2011, the OSQ announced the appointment of Fabien Gabel as its 11th music director, as of the 2012-2013 season, with an initial contract of 4 years.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite press release | url=http://www.osq.org/media/146994/osq-communiqu__nouveauchef_vfinal.pdf | title=L'Orchestre symphonique de Québec accueille son nouveau directeur musical: Fabien Gabel | publisher=Orchestre Symphonique de Québec | date=1 December 2011 | accessdate=2012-01-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Origomu'''  is a movement originated in [[New York City]] by [[Chile]]an artist [[Tatiana Pagés]] in 2009. It is the practice of recycling plastic waste into wearable art. Origomu or オリゴム comes from the Japanese ori, meaning “folding”, and gomu, meaning “rubber”.&lt;ref name="Listín Diario"&gt;http://www.listindiario.com/las-sociales/2010/8/7/153823/Cambia-el-mundo-con-tus-propias-manos&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="SOMAMAG"&gt;http://somamagazine.com/origomu/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldschmiede Zeitung"&gt;http://www.gz-online.de/cgi-bin/adframe/design/article.html?ADFRAME_MCMS_ID=3286&amp;id=1305739720149392501128313&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="El Heraldo"&gt;http://www.elheraldo.hn/content/view/full/401572&lt;/ref&gt;

==Overview==
The technique has been taught in workshops at [[Pratt Institute]] in [[New York City]], making necklaces using six-pack rings as chief material. Origomu is based in connecting art and fashion with environmental awareness. The technique has also been taught in workshops for low-income women.&lt;ref name="Listín Diario"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Goldschmiede Zeitung"/&gt;

Origomu necklaces has since been displayed at the Eco-Fashion exhibit at The Museum of FIT, the [[Cirque Du Soleil]] Ecological Tent in [[Montreal]], Canada, the country of [[Ecuador]] and the Punta Cana Foundation in [[Dominican Republic]].&lt;ref name="Listín Diario"/&gt;&lt;ref name="miami.com"&gt;http://www.miami.com/el-arte-y-la-moda-del-origomu&lt;/ref&gt;

Origomu organized an international design contest. Creations from 25 countries were submitted and design and fashion experts chose the most innovative pieces. There was a first round of 8 finalists, out of these, three winners.&lt;ref name="Goldschmiede Zeitung"/&gt;&lt;ref name="miami.com"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Origomu Website"&gt;http://www.origomu.com&lt;/ref&gt;

By April 2011, the movement had collected over 200,000 plastic six-pack rings, resulting in more than 500 Origomu designs. Over 305 designers have created Origomu pieces from countries such as Mexico, India, [[Portugal]], New Zealand, United States, [[Ecuador]], [[Chile]], Belgium and Switzerland, among others.&lt;ref name="Origomu Website"&gt;http://www.origomu.com&lt;/ref&gt;

The 2010/2011 exhibition ''Signed Without Signature: Works by Charles and Isabella Edenshaw'' at the UBC Museum of Anthropology attested to the artistic strength of Adams' ancestors, and she and three other matrilineal descendants of the Edenshaws attended its opening.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://moa.ubc.ca/wp-content/uploads/MOA-Annual-Report-2010-2011.pdf|title=Museum of Anthropology Annual Report 2010-2011|editor=Jennifer Webb|publisher=Museum of Anthropology, University of British Columbia|date=|website=|archive-url=|archive-date=|dead-url=|access-date=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Promises! Promises!''''' (presented as '''''Promises... Promises!''''' on screen) is a 1963 unrated [[sex comedy]] film produced by [[Tommy Noonan]], released toward the end of the [[Hays code]]'s existence and before the [[MPAA film rating system]] became effective. It was the first [[Hollywood]] motion picture release of the sound era to feature a [[Mainstream#In film|mainstream]] star—[[Jayne Mansfield]]—in the [[nude]], though had the [[Unfinished creative work|unfinished]] ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'', which starred [[Marilyn Monroe]], been released in 1962 as planned, it would have been entitled to claim that distinction.

==Production==
Made on a modest budget, the film's publicity centered on Mansfield's nude scenes as the main attraction. She also sings two songs in the film{{spaced ndash}}"I'm in Love" (also known as the "Lullaby of Love") and "Promise Her Anything".&lt;ref name="faris-94"&gt;{{cite book | first = Jocelyn | last = Faris | title = Jayne Mansfield: a bio-bibliography | page = 94 | publisher = ABC-CLIO | year = 1994 | isbn = 0-313-28544-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; The production went through so much bickering between producer/actor Tommy Noonan and Mansfield that Noonan had to fly in Jet Fore, a publicist from [[20th Century Fox]], to keep peace on the set.&lt;ref&gt;Raymond Strait, ''Here They Are Jayne Mansfield'', page 146, SP Books, 1992, {{ISBN|1-56171-146-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Mansfield's husband, [[Mickey Hargitay]], also had a lead role in the film.

[[Tommy Noonan]] had offered the role of Claire to [[Mamie Van Doren]], but she declined and was replaced with [[Marie McDonald]]. [[Ceil Chapman]] worked on McDonald’s wardrobe for the film.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Filmography by type for Ceil Chapman|url=https://www.imdb.com/name/nm0152320/filmotype|work=IMDB|publisher=The Internet Movie Database|accessdate=19 May 2011}}&lt;/ref&gt; It turned out to be McDonald's final screen appearance.

The film was presented for the first time on television in its uncut form in 1984 on the [[Playboy Channel]]. The film was one of several dozen sound films to have been released in full-length form on [[Super 8mm]] in the 1970s. The film was released on VHS and Beta videotape in the 1980s. On February 14, 2006, [[VCI Home Video]] released the film on DVD with extras such as original trailers and a gallery of stills from the ''Playboy'' issue along with previously unreleased [[lobby card]]s.

==Plot==
Sandy Brooks (Mansfield) is desperate to get pregnant, but her husband Jeff (Tommy Noonan), a television script writer, is too stressed out to make love to her. In an attempt at a sea change, they go on a pleasure cruise and meet another couple, Claire and King Banner ([[Marie McDonald]] and [[Mickey Hargitay]]).&lt;ref name=NYT&gt;{{cite news | last = Brennan | first = Sandra | title = Promises! Promises! | publisher = The New York Times | date = 2006-11-25 | url = http://movies2.nytimes.com/gst/movies/movie.html?v_id=39496 | accessdate = 2006-11-25}}&lt;/ref&gt; Both couples set out on a drunken spree. They end up changing partners when retiring to their rooms. Later both women discover that they're pregnant, and set out to find whether the fathers are their own or the other's husband.&lt;ref name=NYT/&gt;

==Nude scenes==
[[File:Jayne Mansfield and Tommy Noonan in Promises Promises.jpg|thumb|left|Mansfield and [[Tommy Noonan]] in the most repeated nude scene of the movie]]
It was the first [[Hollywood]] motion picture release of the sound era to feature a [[mainstream]] star—[[Jayne Mansfield]]—in the [[nude]].&lt;ref name="black"&gt;{{cite book | last = Black | first = Gregory D. | title = Hollywood Censored: Morality Codes, Catholics, and the Movies (Cambridge Studies in the History of Mass Communication) | publisher = [[Cambridge University Press]] | date = January 26, 1996 | location = | pages = | isbn = 0-521-56592-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; That distinction was to have gone to [[Marilyn Monroe]], who shot a nude scene for director [[George Cukor]]'s ''[[Something's Got to Give]]'' in 1962, but the film went unfinished after Monroe's death. The first movie featuring a mainstream star fully nude was ''[[A Daughter of the Gods]]'' (1916) featuring [[Annette Kellerman]], but the [[Hays code]] had brought an end to nudity in mainstream American films.&lt;ref name="black"/&gt;

Mansfield appears undressed in three scenes in ''Promises! Promises!''. These three scenes are repeated a few times in the movie as [[dream sequence]]s. The first and longest (59 seconds) in a part of the scene where she sings "I'm In Love" semi-nude in a foam filled bathtub, then bends over with her back to the camera.&lt;ref name="faris-94"/&gt;&lt;ref name=hosoda&gt;Craig Hosoda, ''The Bare Facts Video Guide'', page 137, Bare Facts, 1991, {{ISBN|0-9625474-2-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The second when she towels herself off (4 seconds), and the most repeated (4 times) third when she writhes around on a bed (6 seconds).&lt;ref name=hosoda/&gt; Mansfield reportedly drank some champagne in order to give her the will to get undressed in front of the camera.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Promises! Promises! (1963) | publisher = IMDB | date = | url = https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0057428/ | accessdate = 2006-11-23}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Though the film actually showed her only [[Toplessness|topless]], a photo in [[Kenneth Anger]]'s book ''[[Hollywood Babylon]]'' shows Mansfield on the set completely nude with [[pubic hair]] visible.&lt;ref name="babylon"&gt;{{cite book | last = Anger | first = Kenneth | authorlink = Kenneth Anger | title = [[Hollywood Babylon|Hollywood Babylon: The Legendary Underground Classic of Hollywood's Darkest and Best Kept Secrets]] | publisher = Dell (Reissue edition) | date = November 15, 1981 | location = USA | pages = | isbn = 0-440-15325-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the 1960s, [[8 mm film]] mail order companies sold the nude footage.&lt;ref name="faris-94"/&gt; After Mansfield's death, the documentary ''[[The Wild, Wild World of Jayne Mansfield]]'' (1968) included nude scenes from this film and pages from the ''Playboy'' pictorial, along with scenes from her other films including ''[[Too Hot to Handle (1960 film)|Too Hot to Handle]]'' (1960), ''[[The Loves of Hercules]]'' (1960) and ''[[L'Amore Primitivo]]'' (1964).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Mike | last = Quarles | title = Down and Dirty: Hollywood's Exploitation Filmmakers and Their Movies | page = 27}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Playboy==
In a set of photographs published in a ''[[Playboy]]'' pictorial (titled ''The Nudest Jayne Mansfield''), Mansfield stares at her breast, as does [[T. C. Jones]] (Babbette, a [[Drag queen|female impersonator]] hair stylist), then grasps it in her hand and lifts it high.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | last = Parish | first = James Robert | title = The Hollywood Book of Scandals : The Shocking, Often Disgraceful Deeds and Affairs of Over 100 American Movie and TV Idols | publisher = McGraw-Hill | date = May 28, 2004 | location = USA | pages = | isbn = 0-07-142189-0}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = May | last = Mann | title = Jayne Mansfield: A biography | page = 129 | publisher = Drake Publishers | year = 1973 | isbn = 0-87749-415-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt; The publicity and advanced blurbs on ''Playboy'' put Mansfield's name out as a major box office draw, though reviews of the film were next to disastrous.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Raymond | last = Strait | title = Here They Are Jayne Mansfield | page = 165 | publisher = SP Books | year = 1992 | isbn = 1-56171-146-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; However, most of the offers that she received were largely of similar [[Pornographic film|skin flicks]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | first = Raymond | last = Strait | title = Here They Are Jayne Mansfield | page = 248 | publisher = SP Books | year = 1992 | isbn = 1-56171-146-2}}&lt;/ref&gt; The film was heavily publicized in the July 1963 issue of ''Playboy'', and led to an [[obscenity]] charge against [[Hugh Hefner]], the publisher.&lt;ref name="babylon"/&gt;  Hefner was arrested by the Chicago police in June 1963, the only time in his life, and was acquitted by the jury.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web | last = | first = | title = Has Hef ever been arrested? | publisher = Playboy Online | date = | url = http://www.playboy.com/worldofplayboy/faq/hef.html#6 | accessdate =  2006-11-29}}&lt;/ref&gt; The jury voted 7–5 for acquittal.&lt;ref&gt;Edward P.

==Reception==
''Promises!

'''''Saint John the Evangelist''''' is a painting by the Italian Baroque painter [[Domenico Zampieri|Domenichino]].  In February 2014 it was on display in the [[National Gallery, London]], on loan from a private collection. 

==History==
The painting is thought to have been commissioned by either [[Benedetto Giustiniani|Benedetto]] (1554–1621) or his brother [[Vincenzo Giustiniani]] (1564–1637) since it appears in the 1638 [[Giustiniani]] inventory. Paintings of Saints [[Saint Matthew|Matthew]], [[Saint Mark|Mark]] and [[Saint Luke|Luke]] (by [[Nicolas Régnier]], [[Francesco Albani]] and [[Guido Reni]] respectively) are also included, all stated to be the same size as the Saint John. It has been suggested therefore that the four paintings were originally intended as a series.&lt;ref name="christies"/&gt;

Despite the prestigious commission, the date of the painting's execution remains unclear. Richard E. Spear, author of numerous publications on [[Seicento|17th-century Italian painting]] and one of the foremost scholars on the life and work of Domenichino,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.oberlin.edu/faculty/rspear/spear.html|title=Richard E. Spear|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; put the work at around 1627 to 1629. This is due to stylistic similarities with works such as the Sant'Andrea della Valle's ''Saint John''. An alternative theory, put forward in Squarzina's analysis of the 1938 Giustiniani inventory, speculates that the work could be from before 1621. Others have concluded dates between 1624 and 1628.

The painting descended via Vincenzo Giustiniani's heir to Prince Benedetto Giustiniani, in whose posthumous inventory of 1793 it appears, then to Andrea Giustiniani, who in 1804 declined a purchase offer of 6,500 [[scudo (Italian coin)|scudi]] for it. Andrea then had it taken to Paris, probably before 1806, where he sold it to [[Alexis Delahante]]. Delahante and W. Harris then sold it to Richard Hart Davis and it was then sold in around 1813 with the rest of Davis's collection to Philip John Miles. Inherited firstly by his son, [[Sir William Miles, 1st Baronet|William Miles]] then his grandson [[Sir Philip John William Miles, 2nd Baronet|Philip Miles]], the picture was kept at [[Leigh Court]] where it, along with others in the family's extensive collection, could be viewed upon application.   The impact of the [[Long Depression]] and an agricultural crisis depressing farm prices due to cheap imports from abroad, however, simultaneously attacked this landowning and banking family's sources of income and caused Sir Philip to seek to sell in 1884 at [[Christie's]] where part of the collection was among the first to be sold under the terms of Gladstone's [[Settled Lands Act]].   However, Domenichino and his contemporaries had by then gone out of fashion with British buyers and the ''Saint John the Evangelist'' remained unsold. 

It was then auctioned at Christie's again in 1899 on the death of Cecil Miles, 3rd Baronet who was Philip John Miles's great-grandson – this time it was bought in at 100 guineas and subsequently sold for 70 guineas to M. Colnaghi, acting as agent for Augustus Langham Christie of Tapeley Park, Devonshire and Glyndebourne, East Sussex, part of the Christie family. The painting passed down through that family (later headed by [[John Christie (opera manager)|John Christie]] and known for their connection to the [[Glyndebourne Festival Opera]]) for more than a century until it was auctioned in London in December 2009 to an American buyer for £9.2 million. However, it was then the object of an [[export bar]] to keep it in the [[United Kingdom]] due to its history of ownership in the country. British galleries were unable to raise enough money to buy it (the [[National Gallery, London|National Gallery]] and [[National Galleries of Scotland]] already being committed to an expensive deal to buy ''[[Diana and Actaeon (Titian)|Diana and Actaeon]]'' and ''[[Diana and Callisto]]'', both by [[Titian]]), but another anonymous collector was allowed to acquire it on the condition that it be displayed to the public for three months each year. He then loaned it to the National Gallery in London from May 2010 to August 2011, where it had previously been displayed from 1992 to 1994.&lt;ref&gt;[https://archive.is/20120917155603/http://www.thisislondon.co.uk/standard/article-23741650-details/Glyndebourne+family+to+sell+Old+Master+for+10+million/article.do Glyndebourne family to sell Old Master for £10 million], ''London Evening Standard'', 9 Sept 2009&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.theguardian.com/artanddesign/2010/may/18/saved-painting-domenichino-national-gallery 'Saved' Domenichino painting loaned to National Gallery], Guardian, 18 May 2010&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://news.bbc.co.uk/1/hi/entertainment_and_arts/10119883.stm|title=Baroque painting by master Domenichino saved for nation|work=BBC News|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/private-collectors-16392m-saves-masterpiece-from-export-1975587.html|title=Private collector's &amp;#163;9.2m saves masterpiece from export - News - Art - The Independent|work=The Independent|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.artdaily.org/index.asp?int_sec=11&amp;int_new=33182|title=Domenichino Masterpiece to Be Offered at Christie's Auction of Old Masters and 19th Century Art|author=Ignacio Villarreal|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
[[John the Evangelist|Saint John the Evangelist]] is depicted as a young man accompanied by his traditional symbol the eagle and two [[putti]]. His gaze is directed upwards towards God as he receives the inspiration for his [[gospel]], emphasised by the strong [[chiaroscuro]] light bearing down upon him. This was typical of the artist's style, continuing in the manner of late [[Raphael]] and his own master [[Annibale Carracci]].

The composition is said to have been inspired by classical sculpture, with some commentators pointing specifically to [[Laocoön and His Sons|The Laocoon]].&lt;ref name="christies"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.christies.com/LotFinder/lot_details.aspx?from=searchresults&amp;intObjectID=5277781&amp;sid=c6f04220-8a30-494e-be4f-fc7874d4c049|title=Domenico Zampieri, Il Domenichino (Bologna 1581-1641 Naples)|author=Christie?s|publisher=|accessdate=19 June 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is also evident in Domenichino's other large-scale treatments of the subject such as Madonna and Child with the Saints John the Evangelist and Petronius and the pendentive in the church of  [[Sant'Andrea della Valle]]. The painting also includes an example of the artist's landscape painting, an aspect of his work that was particularly influential on the likes of [[Claude Lorrain]] and [[Nicolas Poussin]]. This element of the work was originally more compressed into the right-hand section of the canvas, the architecture taking precedence. However,  Domenichino reconsidered this layout and over painted an extension of the landscape onto the wall. Other alterations are also visible in the books, the hand of the right putto and the larger hill of the landscape.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="5419">The '''Jane Schaffer paragraph'''  is a five-sentence paragraph developed by Jane Schaffer, used to write essays.&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;{{cite web|url=http://huertas.vms.lusd.org/Johnschafferhowsto.html|title=John Schaffer How-To&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; The paragraph only makes up one of many paragraphs in an essay, most of which have a non-Schaffer-like introduction and conclusion. The structure is utilized because it is thought to help students who struggle with paragraph structure and is taught in some U.S. [[middle school]]s and in early [[high school]] classes.&lt;ref name=autogenerated3&gt;{{cite journal |title= The Popularity of Formulaic Writing (And Why We Need to Resist)|journal= The English Journal|volume= 90|issue= 1|pages= 61–67|author= |jstor=821733|last1= Wiley|first1= Mark|year= 2000}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=autogenerated2&gt;{{cite journal |title= Toward Maturity in Judging Fiction: An Approach to Schaefer's "Shane"|journal= The English Journal|volume= 49|issue= 1|pages= 22–26|author= |jstor=808912|last1= Dunning|first1= A. Stephen|year= 1960}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Requirements==
General Schaffer paragraphs have some requirements as follows:
*Must not be written in [[first-person narrative|first person]]
*Every paragraph must be at least five sentences long; however, there can be more as long as the same ratio of two CMs to every CD is kept &lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.walnutvalley.k12.ca.us/dbhs/stenace/johnshaffer.htm|title=John Schaffer Paragraph Construction&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;
*Each section (TS, CD, CM, CS) is only one sentence in length
*Each section should also avoid past tense and only be written in present tense

==Paragraph Structure==
*Topic Sentence (TS) Otherwise known as a Topic Ghey
*Concrete Detail (CD)            
*Commentary (CM)
*Commentary (CM)
*Closing/Concluding sentence (CS)

A basic Schaffer paragraph begins with the topic sentence—stating what the paragraph is about, then followed by a concrete detail, two commentary sentences, and a closing sentence. This is called a one-chunk body paragraph and is the most basic Schaffer model.

One of the key elements in the Schaffer program is what is called the "ratio." Ratio is the amount of Concrete Detail in a paragraph compared to the amount of commentary. In the above paragraph the ratio is 1:2. The actual ratio for response to literature is 1:2+, which means there must be at least two sentences of Commentary for each sentence of Concrete Detail like so:

*Topic sentence (TS)
*Concrete Detail (CD)
*Commentary (CM)
*Commentary (CM)
*Concrete Detail (CD)
*Commentary (CM)
*Commentary (CM)
*Closing/Concluding sentence (CS)

Note that the ratio is still 1:2+ (At least twice as much Commentary as there is Concrete Detail)

===Topic sentence/statement (TS)===
This sentence should state the main point of the paragraph and be straight to the point
:''Example 1: Cinderella lives a miserable life.''
:''Example 2: Global warming is a world problem and needs to be stopped.''

===Concrete detail (CD)===
This sentence is the  "what" is happening.  It should be either facts, examples, illustrations, evidence, support, plot references, [[paraphrase]]s, [[citations]], quotations, plot summary, etc.  It should be a concrete detail and should start with ''&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;for example&lt;nowiki&gt;'&lt;/nowiki&gt;'' or a different [[Transition words|transition]].
:''Example 1: For example, she does all the cooking, cleaning, and sewing. ''
:''Example 2: If it is not stopped, statistics show that the world will be drastically hurt. ''

===Commentary (CM)===
There are one or two [[wikt:commentary|commentary]] sentences in each chunk.  They contain no facts, rather, comments from the paragraph writer about the fact presented in the CD. This sentence contains analysis, interpretation, character feelings, opinions, inference, insight, reasons, or color commentator.   It is important that the commentary explain how the concrete detail helps prove the writer's point (the TS).
:''Example 1:''
::CM1: ''This shows that she feels taken advantage of by her selfish stepmother and stepsisters.''
::CM2: ''This is important because her horrible life gives her a present, her fairy godmother.''
:''Example 2:''
::CM1: ''Global warming should be man's greatest worry.''
::CM2: ''This is because the Earth can become negatively and drastically affected world wide.
::CM3  '' Commentary sentence is an opinion and a reaction.

General practice is that commentary sentences often start with a [[Transitions (linguistics)|transition]] such as the following:
*This (also) shows that
*This is (important) because
*In addition
*Furthermore,
*Therefore,
*Also
*For example,

===Concluding sentence / closing sentence (CS)===
The Concluding Sentence (CS) is the closing sentence that wraps up the TS and sums up the paragraph. It closes up the thoughts and gives insight to the next paragraph. Emotional or connotative words are preferred here usually beginning with "As a result" or another concluding sentence.
:''Example 1: As a result, she becomes a princess.''
:''Example 2: Therefore, global warming is top priority and cannot be ignored.''

[[File:Operating system placement (software).svg|thumb|upright|A diagram showing how the [[User (computing)|user]] interacts with [[application software]] on a typical [[desktop computer]].The application software layer interfaces with the [[operating system]], which in turn communicates with the [[Personal computer hardware|hardware]]. The arrows indicate information flow.]]

'''Computer software''', or simply '''software''', is a collection of [[data (computing)|data]] or computer instructions that tell the computer how to work. This is in contrast to [[Computer hardware|physical hardware]], from which the system is built and actually performs the work. In [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]], computer software is all [[information]] processed by [[computer system]]s, [[Computer program|program]]s and [[data]]. Computer software includes [[computer program]]s, [[Library (computing)|libraries]] and related non-executable [[Data (computing)|data]], such as [[Software documentation|online documentation]] or [[digital media]]. Computer hardware and software require each other and neither can be realistically used on its own.

At the lowest programming level,{{Clarify|reason=What 'level' means can be unclear to non-technical readers|date=August 2018}} [[executable code]] consists of [[Machine code|machine language]] instructions supported by an individual [[Microprocessor|processor]]—typically a [[central processing unit]] (CPU) or a [[graphics processing unit]] (GPU). A machine language consists of groups of [[Binary numbers|binary values]] signifying [[Instruction (computing)|processor instructions]] that change the state of the computer from its preceding state. For example, an instruction may change the value stored in a particular storage location in the computer—an effect that is not directly observable to the user. An instruction [[System call|may also invoke]] one of many [[Input/output|input or output operations]], for example displaying some text on a computer screen; causing state changes which should be visible to the [[User (computing)|user]]. The processor [[Instruction cycle|executes]] the instructions in the order they are provided, unless it is instructed to [[branch instruction|"jump" to a different instruction]], or is [[Interrupt|interrupted]] by the operating system. {{As of|2015}}, most [[Personal computer|personal computers]], [[smartphone]] devices and [[Server (computing)|servers]] have [[Multi-core processor|processors with multiple execution units]] or [[Multiprocessing|multiple processors performing computation]] together, and computing has become a much more [[Concurrent computing|concurrent]] activity than in the past.

The majority of software is written in [[high-level programming language]]s. They are easier and more efficient for programmers because they are closer to [[natural language]]s than machine languages.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Compiler construction|url=http://www.cs.uu.nl/education/vak.php?vak=INFOMCCO|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131102143144/http://www.cs.uu.nl/education/vak.php?vak=INFOMCCO|archivedate=2 November 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; High-level languages are translated into machine language using a [[compiler]] or an [[Interpreter (computing)|interpreter]] or a combination of the two. Software may also be written in a low-level [[assembly language]], which has strong correspondence to the computer's machine language instructions and is translated into machine language using an [[Assembly language|assembler]].

==History==
{{Main article|History of software}}
An outline ([[algorithm]]) for what would have been the first piece of software was written by [[Ada Lovelace]] in the 19th century, for the planned [[Analytical Engine]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=21}} She created [[Mathematical proof|proofs]] to show how the engine would calculate [[Bernoulli number|Bernoulli Numbers]].{{Sfn|Evans|2018|p=21}} Because of the proofs and algorithm, she is considered the first computer programmer.&lt;ref name="Annals of the History of Computing"&gt;{{cite journal|last=Fuegi|first=J.|last2=Francis|first2=J.|date=2003|title=Lovelace &amp; Babbage and the creation of the 1843 'notes'|journal=Annals of the History of Computing|volume=25|issue=4|pages=16–26|doi=10.1109/MAHC.2003.1253887}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Lovelace Google"&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.theguardian.com/technology/2012/dec/10/ada-lovelace-honoured-google-doodle|title=Ada Lovelace honoured by Google doodle|last=|first=|date=December 10, 2012|newspaper=The Guardian|accessdate=25 November 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first theory about software—prior to creation of computers as we know them today—was proposed by Alan Turing in his 1935 essay ''On Computable Numbers, with an Application to the Entscheidungsproblem'' (decision problem).

This eventually led to the creation of the academic fields of [[computer science]] and [[software engineering]]; Both fields study software and its creation. Computer science is the theoretical study of computer and software (Turing's essay is an example of computer science), whereas software engineering is the application of engineering and development of software.

However, prior to 1946, software was not yet the programs stored in the memory of stored-program digital computers, as we now understand it. The first electronic computing devices were instead rewired in order to "reprogram" them.

==Types==
{{See also|List of software categories}}

On virtually all computer platforms, software can be grouped into a few broad categories.

===Purpose, or domain of use===
{{Ecommerce}}
Based on the goal, computer software can be divided into:

* '''[[Application software]]''' &lt;br&gt; which is software that uses the computer system to perform special functions or provide [[video game|entertainment functions]] beyond the basic operation of the computer itself. There are many different types of application software, because the range of tasks that can be performed with a modern computer is so large—see [[list of software]].
* '''[[System software]]''' &lt;br&gt; which is software that directly operates the '''[[computer hardware]]''', to provide basic functionality needed by users and other software, and to provide a platform for running application software.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=System Software|url=http://home.olemiss.edu/~misbook/sfsysfm.htm|archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20010530092843/http://home.olemiss.edu/~misbook/sfsysfm.htm|dead-url=yes|archive-date=30 May 2001|publisher=The University of Mississippi|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; System software includes:
** '''[[Operating system]]s''' &lt;br&gt; which are essential collections of software that manage resources and provides common services for other software that runs "on top" of them. [[Supervisory program]]s, [[boot loader]]s, [[shell (computing)|shells]] and [[window system]]s are core parts of operating systems. In practice, an operating system comes bundled with additional software (including application software) so that a user can potentially do some work with a computer that only has one operating system.
** '''[[Device driver]]s''' &lt;br&gt; which operate or control a particular type of device that is attached to a computer. Each device needs at least one corresponding device driver; because a computer typically has at minimum at least one input device and at least one output device, a computer typically needs more than one device driver.
** '''[[Software utility|Utilities]]''' &lt;br&gt; which are computer [[Programs and Features|programs]] designed to assist users in the maintenance and care of their computers.
* '''[[Malicious software]]''' or '''malware''' &lt;br&gt; which is software that is developed to harm and disrupt computers. As such, malware is undesirable. Malware is closely associated with computer-related crimes, though some malicious programs may have been designed as [[practical joke]]s.

===Nature or domain of execution===
* [[Desktop applications]] such as [[web browser]]s and [[Microsoft Office]], as well as [[smartphone]] and [[Tablet computer|tablet]] applications (called "[[mobile app|apps]]"). (There is a push in some parts of the software industry to merge desktop applications with mobile apps, to some extent. [[Windows 8]], and later [[Ubuntu Touch]], tried to allow the same style of application user interface to be used on desktops, laptops and mobiles.)
* [[JavaScript]] scripts are pieces of software traditionally embedded in [[web pages]] that are run directly inside the [[web browser]] when a web page is loaded without the need for a web browser plugin. Software written in other programming languages can also be run within the web browser if the software is either translated into JavaScript, or if a web browser plugin that supports that language is installed; the most common example of the latter is [[ActionScript]] scripts, which are supported by the [[Adobe Flash]] plugin.
* [[Server software]], including:
** [[Web application]]s, which usually run on the [[web server]] and output dynamically generated web pages to web browsers, using e.g. [[PHP]], [[Java (programming language)|Java]], [[ASP.NET]], or even [[Node.js|JavaScript that runs on the server]]. In modern times these commonly include some JavaScript to be run in the web browser as well, in which case they typically run partly on the server, partly in the web browser.
* [[Plug-in (computing)|Plugins]] and extensions are software that extends or modifies the functionality of another piece of software, and require that software be used in order to function;
* [[Embedded software]] resides as [[firmware]] within [[embedded system]]s, devices dedicated to a single use or a few uses such as [[car]]s and [[television]]s (although some embedded devices such as wireless chipsets can ''themselves'' be part of an ordinary, non-embedded computer system such as a PC or smartphone).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Embedded Software—Technologies and Trends|url=http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/so/2009/03/mso2009030014.html|publisher=IEEE Computer Society|date=May–June 2009|accessdate=6 November 2013|deadurl=no|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20131028045823/http://www.computer.org/csdl/mags/so/2009/03/mso2009030014.html|archivedate=28 October 2013|df=dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the embedded system context there is sometimes no clear distinction between the system software and the application software. However, some embedded systems run [[embedded operating system]]s, and these systems do retain the distinction between system software and application software (although typically there will only be one, fixed, application which is always run).
* [[Microcode]] is a special, relatively obscure type of embedded software which tells the processor ''itself'' how to execute machine code, so it is actually a lower level than machine code. It is typically proprietary to the processor manufacturer, and any necessary correctional microcode software updates are supplied by them to users (which is much cheaper than shipping replacement processor hardware). Thus an ordinary programmer would not expect to ever have to deal with it.

===Programming tools===
{{Main article|Programming tool}}
Programming tools are also software in the form of programs or applications that [[software developer]]s (also known as
''programmers, coders, hackers'' or ''software engineers'') use to create, [[Debugging|debug]], [[Software maintenance|maintain]] (i.e. improve or fix), or otherwise [[Technical support|support]] software. 

Software is written in one or more programming languages; there are many programming languages in existence, and each has at least one implementation, each of which consists of its own set of programming tools. These tools may be relatively self-contained programs such as [[compiler]]s, [[debugger]]s, [[interpreter (computing)|interpreters]], [[linker (computing)|linkers]], and [[text editor]]s, that can be combined together to accomplish a task; or they may form an [[integrated development environment]] (IDE), which combines much or all of the functionality of such self-contained tools. IDEs may do this by either invoking the relevant individual tools or by re-implementing their functionality in a new way. An IDE can make it easier to do specific tasks, such as searching in files in a particular project. Many programming language implementations provide the option of using both individual tools or an IDE.

==Topics==
===Architecture===
{{See also|Software architecture}}
Users often see things differently from programmers. People who use modern general purpose computers (as opposed to [[embedded system]]s, [[analog computer]]s and [[supercomputer]]s) usually see three layers of software performing a variety of tasks: platform, application, and user software.

* '''Platform software''' &lt;br&gt; The [[Platform (computing)|Platform]] includes the [[firmware]], [[device driver]]s, an [[operating system]], and typically a [[graphical user interface]] which, in total, allow a user to interact with the computer and its [[peripheral]]s (associated equipment). Platform software often comes bundled with the computer. On a [[Personal computer|PC]] one will usually have the ability to change the platform software.
* '''Application software''' &lt;br&gt; [[Application software]] or Applications are what most people think of when they think of software. Typical examples include office suites and video games. [[Application software]] is often purchased separately from computer hardware. Sometimes applications are bundled with the computer, but that does not change the fact that they run as independent applications. Applications are usually independent programs from the operating system, though they are often tailored for specific platforms. Most users think of compilers, databases, and other "system software" as applications.
* '''User-written software''' &lt;br&gt; [[End-user development]] tailors systems to meet users' specific needs. User software include spreadsheet templates and [[word processor]] templates. Even email filters are a kind of user software. Users create this software themselves and often overlook how important it is. Depending on how competently the user-written software has been integrated into default application packages, many users may not be aware of the distinction between the original packages, and what has been added by co-workers.

===Execution===
{{Main article|Execution (computing)}}
Computer software has to be "loaded" into the [[computer storage|computer's storage]] (such as the [[hard drive]] or [[Computer memory|memory]]). Once the software has loaded, the computer is able to ''execute'' the software. This involves passing [[instruction (computer science)|instructions]] from the [[application software]], through the system software, to the hardware which ultimately receives the instruction as [[machine language|machine code]]. Each instruction causes the computer to carry out an operation—moving [[data (computing)|data]], carrying out a [[computation]], or altering the [[control flow]] of instructions.

Data movement is typically from one place in memory to another. Sometimes it involves moving data between memory and registers which enable high-speed data access in the CPU. Moving data, especially large amounts of it, can be costly. So, this is sometimes avoided by using "pointers" to data instead. Computations include simple operations such as incrementing the value of a variable data element. More complex computations may involve many operations and data elements together.&lt;!-- This section is simply to long for this article and needs to be compressed into the intro above, or moved to the article itself.

Instructions may be performed sequentially, conditionally, or iteratively. Sequential instructions are those operations that are performed one after another. Conditional instructions are performed such that different sets of instructions execute depending on the value(s) of some data. In some languages this is known as an "if" statement. Iterative instructions are performed repetitively and may depend on some data value. This is sometimes called a "loop." Often, one instruction may "call" another set of instructions that are defined in some other program or [[module (programming)|module]]. When more than one computer processor is used, instructions may be executed simultaneously.

A simple example of the way software operates is what happens when a user selects an entry such as "Copy" from a menu. In this case, a conditional instruction is executed to copy text from data in a 'document' area residing in memory, perhaps to an intermediate storage area known as a 'clipboard' data area. If a different menu entry such as "Paste" is chosen, the software may execute the instructions to copy the text from the clipboard data area to a specific location in the same or another document in memory.

Depending on the application, even the example above could become complicated. The field of software engineering endeavors to manage the complexity of how software operates. This is especially true for software that operates in the context of a large or powerful [[computer system]].

Currently, almost the only limitations on the use of computer software in applications is the ingenuity of the designer/programmer. Consequently, large areas of activities (such as playing grand master level chess) formerly assumed to be incapable of software simulation are now routinely programmed. The only area that has so far proved reasonably secure from software simulation is the realm of human art— especially, pleasing music and literature.{{Citation needed|date=June 2007}}

Kinds of software by operation: [[computer program]] as [[executable]], [[source code]] or [[script (computer programming)|script]], [[computer configuration|configuration]].--&gt;

===Quality and reliability===
{{Main article|Software quality|Software testing|Software reliability}}
Software quality is very important, especially for [[commercial software|commercial]] and system software like [[Microsoft Office]], [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Linux]]. If software is faulty (buggy), it can delete a person's work, crash the computer and do other unexpected things. Faults and errors are called "[[Software bug|bugs]]" which are often discovered during alpha and beta testing. Software is often also a victim to what is known as [[software aging]], the progressive performance degradation resulting from a combination of unseen bugs.

Many bugs are discovered and eliminated (debugged) through [[software testing]]. However, software testing rarely—if ever—eliminates every bug; some programmers say that "every program has at least one more bug" (Lubarsky's Law).&lt;ref name="github"&gt;{{cite web | url=https://github.com/mark-watson/scripting-intelligence-book-examples/blob/master/part1/wikipedia_text/software.txt | title=scripting intelligence book examples | deadurl=no | archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20151106154317/https://github.com/mark-watson/scripting-intelligence-book-examples/blob/master/part1/wikipedia_text/software.txt | archivedate=6 November 2015 | df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; In the [[Waterfall model|waterfall]] method of software development, separate testing teams are typically employed, but in newer approaches, collectively termed [[agile software development]], developers often do all their own testing, and demonstrate the software to users/clients regularly to obtain feedback. Software can be tested through [[unit testing]], [[regression testing]] and other methods, which are done manually, or most commonly, automatically, since the amount of code to be tested can be quite large. For instance, [[NASA]] has extremely rigorous software testing procedures for many operating systems and communication functions. Many NASA-based operations interact and identify each other through command programs. This enables many people who work at NASA to check and evaluate functional systems overall. Programs containing command software enable hardware engineering and system operations to function much easier together.

===License===
{{Main article|Software license}}
The software's license gives the user the right to use the software in the licensed environment, and in the case of [[free software license]]s, also grants other rights such as the right to make copies.

[[Proprietary software]] can be divided into two types:

* [[freeware]], which includes the category of "free trial" software or "[[freemium]]" software (in the past, the term [[shareware]] was often used for free trial/freemium software). As the name suggests, freeware can be used free, although in the case of free trials or freemium software, this is sometimes only true for a limited period of time or with limited functionality.
* software available for a fee, often inaccurately termed "[[commercial software]]", which can only be legally used on purchase of a license.

[[Open source software]], on the other hand, comes with a [[free software license]], granting the recipient the rights to modify and redistribute the software.

===Patents===
{{Main article|Software patent|Software patent debate}}
Software patents, like other types of patents, are theoretically supposed to give an inventor an exclusive, time-limited license for a ''detailed idea (e.g. an algorithm) on how to implement'' a piece of software, or a component of a piece of software. Ideas for useful things that software could ''do'', and user ''requirements'', are not supposed to be patentable, and concrete implementations (i.e. the actual software packages implementing the patent) are not supposed to be patentable either—the latter are already covered by copyright, generally automatically. So software patents are supposed to cover the middle area, between requirements and concrete implementation. In some countries, a requirement for the claimed invention to have an effect on the physical world may also be part of the requirements for a software patent to be held valid—although since ''all'' useful software has effects on the physical world, this requirement may be open to debate. Meanwhile, American copyright law was applied to various aspects of the writing of the software code.&lt;ref&gt; Gerardo Con Díaz, "The Text in the Machine: American Copyright Law and the Many Natures of Software, 1974–1978,” ''Technology and Culture'' 57 (October 2016), 753–79.  &lt;/ref&gt;

Software patents are controversial in the software industry with many people holding different views about them. One of the sources of controversy is that the aforementioned split between initial ideas and patent does not seem to be honored in practice by patent lawyers—for example the patent for [[Aspect-Oriented Programming]] (AOP), which purported to claim rights over ''any'' programming tool implementing the idea of AOP, howsoever implemented. Another source of controversy is the effect on innovation, with many distinguished experts and companies arguing that software is such a fast-moving field that software patents merely create vast additional litigation costs and risks, and actually retard innovation. In the case of debates about software patents outside the United States, the argument has been made that large American corporations and patent lawyers are likely to be the primary beneficiaries of allowing or continue to allow software patents.

==Design and implementation==
{{Main article|Software development|Computer programming|Software engineering}}
Design and implementation of software varies depending on the complexity of the software. For instance, the design and creation of [[Microsoft Word]] took much more time than designing and developing [[Microsoft Notepad]] because the latter has much more basic functionality.

Software is usually designed and created (aka coded/written/programmed) in [[integrated development environment]]s (IDE) like [[Eclipse (software)|Eclipse]], [[IntelliJ IDEA|IntelliJ]] and [[Microsoft Visual Studio]] that can simplify the process and [[compiler|compile]] the software (if applicable). As noted in a different section, software is usually created on top of existing software and the [[application programming interface]] (API) that the underlying software provides like [[GTK+]], JavaBeans or [[Swing (Java)|Swing]]. Libraries (APIs) can be categorized by their purpose. For instance, the [[Spring framework|Spring Framework]] is used for implementing [[enterprise application]]s, the [[Windows Forms]] library is used for designing graphical user interface (GUI) applications like [[Microsoft Word]], and [[Windows Communication Foundation]] is used for designing [[web service]]s. When a program is designed, it relies upon the API. For instance, a Microsoft Windows desktop application might call API functions in the [[.NET Framework|.NET]] Windows Forms library like ''Form1.Close()'' and ''Form1.Show()''&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/default.aspx |title=MSDN Library |accessdate=2010-06-14 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100611204810/http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/default.aspx |archivedate=11 June 2010 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt; to close or open the application. Without these APIs, the programmer needs to write these functionalities entirely themselves. Companies like [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]] and [[Microsoft]] provide their own APIs so that many applications are written using their [[Library (computing)|software libraries]] that usually have numerous APIs in them.

[[Data structure]]s such as [[hash table]]s, [[array data type|arrays]], and [[binary tree]]s, and [[algorithm]]s such as [[quicksort]], can be useful for creating software.

Computer software has special economic characteristics that make its design, creation, and distribution different from most other economic goods.{{Specify|Which characteristics?|date=May 2012}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal |author=v. Engelhardt, Sebastian |year=2008 |url=https://ideas.repec.org/p/jrp/jrpwrp/2008-045.html |title=The Economic Properties of Software |journal=Jena Economic Research Papers |volume=2 |issue=2008–045. |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20160105145954/https://ideas.repec.org/p/jrp/jrpwrp/2008-045.html |archivedate=5 January 2016 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://dankaminsky.com/1999/03/02/69/ |title=Why Open Source Is The Optimum Economic Paradigm for Software |first=Dan |last=Kaminsky |year=1999 |deadurl=no |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20120522001231/http://dankaminsky.com/1999/03/02/69/ |archivedate=22 May 2012 |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;

A person who creates software is called a [[programmer]], [[software engineer]] or [[software developer]], terms that all have a similar meaning. More informal terms for programmer also exist such as "coder" and "'''hacker'''"{{Spaced ndash}}although use of the latter word may cause confusion, because it is more often used to mean [[Hacker (computer security)|someone who illegally breaks into computer systems]].

==Industry and organizations==
{{Main article|Software industry}}
A great variety of software companies and programmers in the world comprise a software industry. Software can be quite a profitable industry: [[Bill Gates]], the co-founder of [[Microsoft]] was the richest person in the world in 2009, largely due to his ownership of a significant number of shares in Microsoft, the company responsible for [[Microsoft Windows]] and [[Microsoft Office]] software products - both market leaders in their respective product categories.

Non-profit software organizations include the [[Free Software Foundation]], [[GNU Project]] and [[Mozilla Foundation]]. Software standard organizations like the [[W3C]], [[IETF]] develop recommended software standards such as [[XML]], [[HTTP]] and [[HTML]], so that software can interoperate through these standards.

Other well-known large software companies include [[Google]], [[IBM]], [[TCS]], [[Infosys]], [[Wipro]], [[HCL Technologies]], [[Oracle Corporation|Oracle]], [[Novell]], [[SAP AG|SAP]], [[Symantec]], [[Adobe Systems]], [[Sidetrade]] and [[Corel]], while small companies often provide innovation.

'''Swan-neck bottles''', also referred to as '''''ashkdān''''' in [[Persian language|Persian]], are a type of ornamental glass bottle made in [[Iran]], characterized by their long neck. 

These bottles are the best-known examples of an Iranian glassware tradition that began under the reign of Shah [[Abbas I of Persia|Abbas I]] (1587–1629), notably in [[Shiraz]] and [[Isfahan]], and which was inspired by 16th-century [[Venetian glass]]ware imported into the Muslim world.&lt;ref name="Ekhtiar 280"&gt;{{cite book|last1=Ekhtiar|first1=Maryam D.|title=Masterpieces from the Department of Islamic Art in the Metropolitan Museum of Art|date=2011|publisher=Metropolitan Museum of Art|location=New York|isbn=9781588394347|page=280|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=vO761l9dgZwC&amp;pg=PA280}}&lt;/ref&gt; Paintings from the [[Safavid dynasty|Safavid]] period indicate that the bottles were used to hold wine or other beverages,&lt;ref name="Ekhtiar 280" /&gt; or to adorn wall niches.&lt;ref name="MBAM"&gt;[[Montreal Museum of Fine Arts]], plaque accompanying the exhibit 1963.Dg.1, visited 2014.&lt;/ref&gt; Folklore has it that they were also used as [[rose water]] sprinklers and to collect the tears of wives separated from their husbands, hence the Persian appellation ''ashkdān'', "container for tears".&lt;ref name="Ekhtiar 280" /&gt; There is no generally accepted explanation for the particular shape and length of these bottles' neck.&lt;ref name="Ekhtiar 280" /&gt;

In the 19th century, many swan-neck bottles were collected by European travellers and brought to Europe, where they were much in demand. They are still being produced in Iran.&lt;ref name="MBAM" /&gt;

{{nihongo|'''''The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife'''''|蛸と海女|Tako to ama|''[[Octopus]](es) and [[ama diver|shell diver]]''}}, also known as '''''Girl Diver and Octopuses''''', '''''Diver and Two Octopuses''''', etc., is a [[Woodblock printing|woodblock-printed]] design by the [[Japan]]ese artist [[Hokusai]]. It is included in ''Kinoe no Komatsu'' ({{lang-en|Young Pines}}), a three-volume book of [[Shunga (art)|shunga]] erotica first published in 1814, and has become Hokusai's most famous shunga design. Playing with themes popular in Japanese art, it depicts a young [[ama diver]] entwined sexually with a pair of [[octopus]]es.

==History and description==
''The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife'' is the most famous image in ''Kinoe no Komatsu'', published in three volumes from 1814. The book is a work of [[Shunga (art)|shunga]] ([[erotic art]]) within the [[ukiyo-e]] genre.&lt;ref&gt;Uhlenbeck, p. 56; 161.&lt;/ref&gt; The image depicts a woman, evidently an ''[[ama diver|ama]]'' (a shell diver), enveloped in the [[cephalopod limb|limbs]] of two octopuses. The larger of the two mollusks performs [[cunnilingus]] on her, while the smaller one, his offspring, assists by fondling the woman's mouth and left nipple. In the text above the image the woman and the creatures express their mutual sexual pleasure from the encounter.&lt;ref name=Uhlenbeck&gt;Uhlenbeck, p. 161.&lt;/ref&gt;

All designs in the publication are untitled; this design is generally known in Japanese as ''Tako to ama'', translated variously into English. [[Richard Douglas Lane]] calls it ''Girl Diver and Octopi'';&lt;ref&gt;Lane, p. 163&lt;/ref&gt; Matthi Forrer calls it ''Pearl Diver and Two Octopi'';&lt;ref&gt;Forrer, p. 124&lt;/ref&gt; and Danielle Talerico calls it ''Diver and Two Octopi''.&lt;ref name=Talerico&gt;Talerico 24-42.&lt;/ref&gt; The open book measures 6½" × 8&amp;frac34;" (16.51&amp;nbsp;cm × 22.23&amp;nbsp;cm).&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.akantiek.nl/hokusai%20p1290.htm Famous Shunga Masterpiece Diving Girl With Octopus - Hokusai - c.1814]  AK Antiek. Retrieved: 17 December 2011.&lt;/ref&gt;

==Interpretations==
[[File:Tamatori being pursued bya dragon.jpg|thumb|left|Woodblock print by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] depicting Tamatori's escape from [[Ryūjin]] and his sea creatures]]
[[File:Tamakatzura Tamatori attacked by the octopus.jpg|thumb|Woodblock print by Kuniyoshi depicting Tamatori fighting an octopus]]

Scholar Danielle Talerico notes that the image would have recalled to the minds of contemporary viewers the story of [[Tide jewels#Later references|Princess Tamatori]], highly popular in the [[Edo period]].&lt;ref name=Uhlenbeck/&gt; In this story, Tamatori is a modest shell diver who marries [[Fujiwara no Fuhito]] of the [[Fujiwara clan]], who is searching for a pearl stolen from his family by [[Ryūjin]], the dragon god of the sea. Vowing to help, Tamatori dives down to Ryūjin's undersea palace of [[Ryūgū-jō]], and is pursued by the god and his army of sea creatures, including octopuses. She cuts open her own breast and places the jewel inside; this allows her to swim faster and escape, but she dies from her wound soon after reaching the surface.&lt;ref name=Miller&gt;Miller, p. 137.&lt;/ref&gt;

The Tamatori story was a popular subject in [[ukiyo-e]] art. The artist [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]] produced works based on it, which often include octopuses among the creatures being evaded by the bare-breasted diver.&lt;ref name=Miller/&gt; In the text above Hokusai's image, the big octopus says he will bring the girl to Ryūjin's undersea palace, strengthening the connection to the Tamatori legend.&lt;ref name=Talerico/&gt; ''The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife'' is not the only work of Edo-period art to depict erotic relations between a woman and an octopus. Some early [[netsuke]] carvings show cephalopods fondling nude women.&lt;ref&gt;Schwarz, pp. 96–97.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Symmes, p. 132.&lt;/ref&gt; Hokusai's contemporary [[Yanagawa Shigenobu]] created an image of a woman receiving cunnilingus from an octopus very similar to Hokusai's in his collection ''Suetsumuhana'' of 1830.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url= http://www.stolaf.edu/people/kucera/YoshidaWebsite/evolution/essay_pages/anne_lenehan_white.htm|title= Shunga and Ukiyo-e: Spring Pictures and Pictures of the Floating World|last1= Lenehan-White|first1= Anne|work= |publisher= www.stolaf.edu|accessdate= 6 November 2010|deadurl= yes|archiveurl= https://web.archive.org/web/20090204154824/http://stolaf.edu/people/kucera/YoshidaWebsite/evolution/essay_pages/anne_lenehan_white.htm|archivedate= 4 February 2009|df= dmy-all}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Talerico notes that earlier Western critics such as [[Edmond de Goncourt]] and Jack Hillier interpreted the work as a [[rape]] scene. She notes that these scholars would have seen it apart from the ''Kinoe no Komatsu'' collection and without understanding the text and visual references, depriving it of its original context.&lt;ref name=Talerico/&gt; Goncourt did, however, know its original context, which he describes in a passage of his monograph on Hokusai.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|title=Hokusai|last=Goncourt|first=Edmond de|publisher=Bibliothèque Charpentier|year=1896|isbn=|location=http://gallica.bnf.fr/ark:/12148/bpt6k82459v|pages=174–175|via=Gallica}}&lt;/ref&gt; According to Chris Uhlenbeck and Margarita Winkel, "[t]his print is testimony to how our interpretation of an image can be distorted when seen in isolation and without understanding the text."&lt;ref name=Uhlenbeck/&gt;

==Influence==
The image is often cited as a forerunner of [[tentacle erotica]], a motif that has been common in modern Japanese animation and [[manga]] since the late 20th century, popularized by author [[Toshio Maeda]]. Modern tentacle erotica similarly depicts sex between women and tentacled beasts; the sex in modern depictions is typically [[rape|forced]], as opposed to Hokusai's mutually pleasurable interaction.&lt;ref name=Briel&gt;Briel, p. 203.&lt;/ref&gt; Psychologist and critic Jerry S. Piven is skeptical that Hokusai's playful image could account for the violent depictions in modern media, arguing that these are instead a product of the turmoil experienced throughout Japanese society following [[World War II]], which was in turn reflective of existing, underlying currents of cultural trauma.&lt;ref&gt;Piven, p. 110–112.&lt;/ref&gt; Scholar Holger Briel argues that "only in a society that already has a predilection for monsters and is used to interacting with octopods such images might arise", citing Hokusai's print an early exemplar of such a tradition.&lt;ref name=Briel/&gt;

The work has influenced later artists such as [[Félicien Rops]], [[Auguste Rodin]], [[Louis Aucoc]], [[Fernand Khnopff]] and [[Pablo Picasso]].&lt;ref&gt;Bru, pp. 55–77.&lt;/ref&gt; Picasso painted his own version in 1903 that has been shown next to Hokusai's original in exhibits on the influence of 19th-century Japanese art on Picasso's work.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Picasso's Japanese erotic inspiration on show in Barcelona|first= |last= |newspaper= [[The Independent]]|date= 6 November 2009 |url= https://www.independent.co.uk/arts-entertainment/art/news/picassos-japanese-erotic-inspiration-on-show-in-barcelona-1815988.html|accessdate=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; In 2003, a derivative work by Australian painter David Laity,  titled ''The Dream of the Fisherman's Wife'', sparked a minor obscenity controversy when it was shown at a gallery in [[Melbourne]]; after receiving complaints Melbourne police investigated and  decided it did not break the city's anti-pornography laws.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Love is a many-tentacled thing... |first= |last= |newspaper= [[The New Zealand Herald]]|date= 21 October 2003 |url= http://www.nzherald.co.nz/world/news/article.cfm?c_id=2&amp;objectid=3529966|agency=[[New Zealand Press Association]]|accessdate=14 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title= Melbourne row over art 'porn'|first= David|last= Fickling |newspaper= [[The Guardian]]|date= 22 October 2003 |url= https://www.theguardian.com/world/2003/oct/22/arts.australia|agency=|accessdate=3 December 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; Hokusai's print has had a wide influence on the modern Japanese-American artist [[Masami Teraoka]], who has created images of women, including a recurring "pearl diver" character, being pleasured by cephalopods as a symbol of female sexual power.&lt;ref&gt;Bing, pp. 44–47.&lt;/ref&gt;

The so-called ''aria della piovra'' ("Octopus aria") ''Un dì, ero piccina'' in [[Pietro Mascagni]]'s opera ''[[Iris (opera)|Iris]]'' (1898), on a libretto by [[Luigi Illica]], may have been inspired by this print. The main character Iris describes a screen she had seen in a Buddhist temple when she was a child, depicting an octopus coiling its limbs around a smiling young woman and killing her. She recalls a Buddhist priest explaining: "That octopus is Pleasure... That octopus is Death!"&lt;ref&gt;Mallach, p. 127 and note.&lt;/ref&gt;

The print is featured briefly in Park Chan Wook's ''[[The Handmaiden]]'' and is intended to illustrate the perverted nature of Uncle Kouzuki's oppression of Lady Hideko to Sook-Hee.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://thefilmstage.com/reviews/cannes-review-the-handmaiden/|title=[Cannes Review] The Handmaiden|date=14 May 2016|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt; It gets more air time in several episodes of the television series ''[[Mad Men]]'', first on the office wall of founding Sterling-Cooper partner Bert Cooper; the print is given to [[Peggy Olson]] by [[Roger Sterling|Roger Sterling, Jr.]] near the [[Person to Person (Mad Men)|series' end]]. Olson decides to hang the print in her office, part of the culmination of her storyline of becoming comfortable as an executive.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://fusion.net/story/129910/what-you-need-to-know-about-that-octopus-erotica-on-mad-men-last-night/|title=What you need to know about that octopus erotica on 'Mad Men'|first=Molly|last=Fitzpatrick|publisher=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''The Love Potion''''' is a 1903 painting by [[Evelyn De Morgan]] depicting a [[witch]] with a [[black cat]] [[familiar spirit|familiar]] at her feet.

According to [[Elise Lawton Smith]],&lt;ref&gt;Elise Lawton Smith (2002), [http://openlibrary.org/b/OL11519827M Evelyn Pickering De Morgan and the Allegorical Body] (Fairleigh Dickinson University Press)&lt;/ref&gt; the painting "exhibits a [[Pre-Raphaelite]] fascination with medieval subjects and decorative detailing."

''The Love Potion'' pushed the boundaries of society's expectations of women by “exploring the nature of female authority through the practice of sorcery." The painting differs from most of De Morgan's earlier works by featuring a sorceress as the subject, rather than a Christian or mythological figure. The sorceress is dressed in an ornate gold gown, which is symbolic of her mastery of skill and the final stage of the alchemical system of progression toward salvation.  Her mastery is further evidenced by the leather bound books on the shelf which were popular alchemy texts during the late nineteenth century. 
Furthermore, the subject is seated in a position making her profile visible which creates a sense of intensity and authority. Her intent stare is fixated on the potion she is mixing in her chalice, which mirrors the gold and sapphire blue seen on her gown.

This repetition of color reinforced the idea that whatever potion she is cooking up is for personal gains. There is also a couple embracing in the background, directly above the chalice which suggests that the potion may also have to do with them. This idea is further supported by the piece of white cloth draped on the bench behind the sorceress, which looks like it’s the missing piece from the woman’s dress.
In the foreground of the work is a black cat which has little definition other than the perfectly round, glowing green eyes. These eyes are mirrored by the green circular glass detail above the subject which gives the illusion of many eyes watching the sorceress at work. The cat also resembles the cat seen in the foreground of [[Edouard Manet]]'s painting ''[[Olympia (Manet)|Olympia]]'', in which the cat is a symbol of prostitution. Although the sorceress in De Morgan's work is probably not a prostitute, the purpose of the cat may still work to symbolize similar taboo practices such as [[alchemy]], which was also frowned upon in Edwardian society. The setting sun seen in the background further suggests something illicit is taking place by creating a mysterious setting.

''The Love Potion'' is a textbook example of De Morgan's characteristic use of bold colors and strong female imagery. Although the subject matter differs slightly from the majority of her works, it is a display of her style and her impeccable attention to detail.

'''The Wild Swans''' is a literary [[fairy tale]] by [[Hans Christian Andersen]] about a [[princess]] who rescues her eleven brothers from a spell cast by an evil queen. The tale was first published on 2&amp;nbsp;October 1838 as the first installment in Andersen's ''[[Fairy Tales Told for Children (1838)|Fairy Tales Told for Children]]'' by C. A. Reitzel in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark. It has been adapted to various media including ballet, television, and film.

==Synopsis==
[[File:The Wild Swans.jpg|thumb|upright|left|"The Wild Swans" by [[Arthur Gaskin]]]]

In a faraway kingdom, there lives a widowed king with his twelve children: eleven [[prince]]s and one [[princess]]. One day, he decides to remarry. He marries a wicked queen who was a [[witch]]. Out of spite, the queen turns her eleven stepsons into [[swan]]s (they are allowed to become human by night) and forces them to fly away. The queen then tries to bewitch their 15-year-old sister, Elisa, but Elisa's goodness is too strong for this, so the queen has Elisa [[banishment|banished]]. The brothers carry Elisa to safety in a foreign land where she is out of the reach of her stepmother.

There, Elisa is guided by the queen of the [[fairies]] to gather [[Urtica dioica|stinging nettles]] in graveyards to knit into shirts that will eventually help her brothers regain their human shapes. Elisa endures painfully blistered hands from nettle stings, and she must also take a [[vow]] of silence for the duration of her task, for speaking one word will kill her brothers. The king of another faraway land happens to come across the mute Elisa and falls in love with her. He grants her a room in his castle where she continues her knitting. Eventually he proposes to crown her as his queen and wife, and she accepts.

However, the [[Archbishop]] is chagrined because he thinks Elisa is herself a witch, but the king will not believe him. One night Elisa runs out of nettles and is forced to collect more in a nearby church graveyard where the Archbishop is watching. Ghoulish spirits that devour the bodies of the dead are also in the churchyard, and the archbishop believes that Elisa is in league with them.  He reports the incident to the king as proof of [[witchcraft]]. The statues of the [[saint]]s shake their heads in protest, but the Archbishop misinterprets this sign as confirmation of Elisa's guilt. The Archbishop orders to put Elisa on [[Witch-hunt|trial for witchcraft]]. She can speak no word in her defense and is sentenced to death by [[death by burning|burning at the stake]].

The brothers discover Elisa's plight and try to speak to the king but fail, thwarted by the rising sun. Even as the [[tumbril]] bears Elisa away to execution, she continues knitting, determined to keep it up to the last moment of her life. This enrages the people, who are on the brink of snatching and destroying the shirts when the swans descend and rescue Elisa. The people interpret this as a sign from Heaven that Elisa is innocent, but the [[executioner]] still makes ready for the burning. When Elisa throws the shirts over the swans, her brothers return to their human forms. (Unfortunately, the youngest brother has a swan's wing instead of an arm, as Elisa did not have time to finish one sleeve of his shirt.)  Elisa is now free to speak and tell the truth, but she faints from exhaustion, so her brothers explain. As they do so, the firewood around Elisa's stake miraculously takes root and bursts into flowers. The king plucks the topmost flower and presents it to Elisa, and they are married. And the youngest prince's wing becomes normal again.

"'''Thumbelina'''" {{IPAc-en|ˌ|θ|ʌ|m|b|ə|ˈ|l|iː|n|ə}} ({{lang-da|Tommelise}}) is a literary fairy tale written by Danish author [[Hans Christian Andersen]] first published by C. A. Reitzel on 16&amp;nbsp;December 1835 in [[Copenhagen]], Denmark, with "The Naughty Boy" and "The Traveling Companion" in the second installment of ''[[Fairy Tales Told for Children. First Collection.|Fairy Tales Told for Children]]''. "Thumbelina" is about a tiny girl and her adventures with appearance- and marriage-minded toads, moles, and [[cockchafers]]. She successfully avoids their intentions before falling in love with a flower-fairy prince just her size.

"Thumbelina" is chiefly Andersen's invention, though he did take inspiration from tales of miniature people such as "[[Tom Thumb]]". "Thumbelina" was published as one of a series of seven fairy tales in 1835 which were not well received by the Danish critics who disliked their informal style and their lack of morals. One critic, however, applauded "Thumbelina".&lt;ref&gt;Wullschlager 2002, p. 165&lt;/ref&gt; The earliest English translation of "Thumbelina" is dated 1846. The tale has been adapted to various media including television drama and animated film.

==Plot==
In the first English translation of 1847 by [[Mary Howitt]], the tale opens with a beggar woman giving a peasant's wife a [[barley]]corn in exchange for food. After the barleycorn is planted and sprouts, a tiny girl, Thumbelina (Tommelise), emerges from its flower. One night, Thumbelina, asleep in her walnut-shell cradle, is carried off by a [[toad]] who wants her as a bride for her son. With the help of friendly [[fish]] and a [[butterfly]], Thumbelina escapes the toad and her son, and drifts on a lily pad until captured by a [[stag beetle]] who later discards her when his friends reject her company.

Thumbelina tries to protect herself from the elements, but when winter comes, she is in desperate straits. She is finally given shelter by an old [[Wood mouse|field mouse]] and tends her dwelling in gratitude. The mouse suggests Thumbelina marry her neighbor, a [[Mole (animal)|mole]], but Thumbelina finds the prospect of being married to such a creature repulsive because he spends all his days underground and never sees the sun or sky. The field mouse keeps pushing Thumbelina into the marriage, saying the mole is a good match for her, and does not listen to her protests.

At the last minute, Thumbelina escapes the situation by fleeing to a far land with a [[swallow]] she nursed back to health during the winter. In a sunny field of flowers, Thumbelina meets a tiny flower-fairy prince just her size and to her liking, and they wed. She receives a pair of wings to accompany her husband on his travels from flower to flower, and a new name, Maia.

In [[Hans Christian Andersen]]'s version of the story, a [[bluebird]] had been viewing Thumbelina's story since the beginning and had been in love with her since. In the end, the bird is heartbroken once Thumbelina marries the flower-fairy prince, and flies off eventually arriving at a small house. There, he tells Thumbelina's story to a man who is implied to be Andersen himself, who chronicles the story in a book.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Opie|1992|pp=221&amp;ndash;9}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Background==
Hans Christian Andersen was born in [[Odense, Denmark]] on 2&amp;nbsp;April 1805 to Hans Andersen, a shoemaker, and Anne Marie Andersdatter.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2002|p=9}}&lt;/ref&gt; An only child, Andersen shared a love of literature with his father, who read him ''[[The Arabian Nights]]'' and [[La Fontaine's Fables|the fables]] of [[Jean de la Fontaine]]. Together, they constructed panoramas, pop-up pictures and toy theatres, and took long jaunts into the countryside.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2002|p=13}}&lt;/ref&gt;
  
[[File:C.A. Jensen 1836 - HC Andersen.jpg|upright|left|thumb|Andersen in 1836]]

Andersen's father died in 1816,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2002|pp=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt;  and from then on, Andersen was left to his own devices.  In order to escape his poor, illiterate mother, he promoted his artistic inclinations and courted the cultured middle class of Odense, singing and reciting in their drawing-rooms.  On 4&amp;nbsp;September 1819, the fourteen-year-old Andersen left Odense for Copenhagen with the few savings he had acquired from his performances, a letter of reference to the ballerina Madame Schall, and youthful dreams and intentions of becoming a poet or an actor.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2002|pp=32–33}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After three years of rejections and disappointments, he finally found a patron in Jonas Collin, the director of the Royal Theatre, who, believing in the boy's potential, secured funds from the king to send Andersen to a grammar school in [[Slagelse]], a provincial town in west [[Zealand]], with the expectation that the boy would continue his education at [[Copenhagen University]] at the appropriate time.

At Slagelse, Andersen fell under the tutelage of Simon Meisling, a short, stout, balding thirty-five-year-old classicist and translator of Virgil's ''[[Aeneid]]''. Andersen was not the quickest student in the class and was given generous doses of Meisling's contempt.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2002|pp=60–61}}&lt;/ref&gt; "You're a stupid boy who will never make it", Meisling told him.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frank|2005|p=77}}&lt;/ref&gt; Meisling is believed to be the model for the learned mole in "Thumbelina".&lt;ref name="FrankP76"/&gt;

Fairy tale and folklorists Iona and Peter Opie have proposed the tale as a "distant tribute" to Andersen's confidante, Henriette Wulff, the small, frail, hunchbacked daughter of the Danish translator of [[William Shakespeare|Shakespeare]] who loved Andersen as Thumbelina loves the swallow;&lt;ref name="OpieP219"/&gt; however, no written evidence exists to support the theory.&lt;ref name="FrankP76" /&gt;

==Sources and inspiration==
"Thumbelina" is essentially Andersen's invention but takes inspiration from the traditional tale of "[[Tom Thumb]]" (both tales begin with a childless woman consulting a supernatural being about acquiring a child). Other inspirations were the six-inch Lilliputians in [[Jonathan Swift]]'s ''[[Gulliver's Travels]]'', [[Voltaire]]'s short story "[[Micromégas]]" with its cast of huge and miniature peoples, and [[E. T. A. Hoffmann]]'s hallucinatory, erotic tale "[[Master Flea|Meister Floh]]", in which a tiny lady a span in height torments the hero. A tiny girl figures in Andersen‘s prose fantasy "A Journey on Foot from Holmen's Canal to the East Point of Amager" (1828),&lt;ref name="FrankP76"&gt;{{Harvnb|Frank|2005|p=76}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="WullschlagerP162"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|p=162}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a literary image similar to Andersen's tiny being inside a flower is found in E. T. A. Hoffmann's "Princess Brambilla” (1821).&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Frank|2005|pp=75–76}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Publication and critical reception==
Andersen published two installments of his first collection of ''[[Fairy Tales Told for Children. First Collection.|Fairy Tales Told for Children]]'' in 1835, the first in May and the second in December. "Thumbelina" was first published in the December installment by C. A. Reitzel on 16 December 1835 in Copenhagen. "Thumbelina" was the first tale in the booklet which included two other tales: "The Naughty Boy" and "The Traveling Companion". The story was republished in collected editions of Andersen's works in 1850 and 1862.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.andersen.sdu.dk/vaerk/register/info_e.html?vid=10 |publisher=Hans Christian Andersen Center |title=Hans Christian Andersen: Thumbelina |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The first reviews of the seven tales of 1835 did not appear until 1836 and the Danish critics were not enthusiastic. The informal, chatty style of the tales and their lack of morals were considered inappropriate in children's literature. One critic however acknowledged "Thumbelina" to be "the most delightful fairy tale you could wish for".&lt;ref name="WullschlagerP165"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2002|p=165}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The critics offered Andersen no further encouragement. One literary journal never mentioned the tales at all while another advised Andersen not to waste his time writing fairy tales. One critic stated that Andersen "lacked the usual form of that kind of poetry [...] and would not study models". Andersen felt he was working against their preconceived notions of what a fairy tale should be, and returned to novel-writing, believing it was his true calling.&lt;ref name="AndersenP335"&gt;{{Harvnb|Andersen|2000|p=335}}&lt;/ref&gt; The critical reaction to the 1835 tales was so harsh that he waited an entire year before publishing "[[The Little Mermaid]]" and "[[The Emperor's New Clothes]]" in the third and final installment of ''Fairy Tales Told for Children''.

However, she did not approve of the opening scene with the witch, and, instead, had the childless woman provide bread and milk to a hungry beggar woman who then rewarded her hostess with a barleycorn.&lt;ref name="OpieP219"/&gt; [[Charles Boner]] also translated the tale in 1846 as "Little Ellie" while Madame de Chatelain dubbed the child 'Little Totty' in her 1852 translation. The editor of ''The Child's Own Book'' (1853) called the child throughout, 'Little Maja'. 

H. W. Dulcken was probably the translator responsible for the name, 'Thumbelina'. His widely published volumes of Andersen's tales appeared in 1864 and 1866.&lt;ref name="OpieP219"&gt;{{Harvnb|Opie|1974|p=219}}&lt;/ref&gt; Mrs. H.B. Paulli translated the name as 'Little Tiny' in the late-nineteenth century.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Eastman||p=258}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In the twentieth century, [[Erik Christian Haugaard]] translated the name as 'Inchelina' in 1974,&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Haugaard|1983|p=29}}&lt;/ref&gt; and Jeffrey and Diane Crone Frank translated the name as 'Thumbelisa' in 2005.  Modern English translations of "Thumbelina" are found in the six-volume complete edition of Andersen's tales from the 1940s by [[Jean Hersholt]], and Erik Christian Haugaard's translation of the complete tales in 1974.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Classe|2000|p=42}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Commentaries==
For fairy tale researchers and folklorists Iona and Peter Opie, "Thumbelina" is an adventure story from the feminine point of view with its moral being people are happiest with their own kind. They point out that Thumbelina is a passive character, the victim of circumstances whereas her male counterpart Tom Thumb (one of the tale's inspirations) is an active character, makes himself felt, and exerts himself.&lt;ref name="OpieP219"/&gt;

Folklorist [[Maria Tatar]] sees “Thumbelina” as a runaway bride story and notes that it has been viewed as an allegory about arranged marriages, and a fable about being true to one's heart that upholds the traditional notion that the love of a prince is to be valued above all else. She points out that in Hindu belief, a thumb-sized being known as the innermost self or soul dwells in the heart of all beings, human or animal, and that the concept may have migrated to European folklore and taken form as Tom Thumb and Thumbelina, both of whom seek transfiguration and redemption. She detects parallels between Andersen's tale and the Greek myth of [[Demeter]] and her daughter, [[Persephone]], and, notwithstanding the pagan associations and allusions in the tale, notes that "Thumbelina" repeatedly refers to [[Christianity|Christ‘s suffering and resurrection]], and the Christian concept of [[salvation]].&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Tatar|2008|pp=193–194, 205}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Andersen biographer Jackie Wullschlager indicates that “Thumbelina” was the first of Andersen's tales to dramatize the sufferings of one who is different, and, as a result of being different, becomes the object of mockery. It was also the first of Andersen's tales to incorporate the [[swallow]] as the symbol of the poetic soul and Andersen's identification with the swallow as a migratory bird whose pattern of life his own traveling days were beginning to resemble.&lt;ref name="WullschlagerP163"&gt;{{Harvnb|Wullschlager|2000|p=163}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Roger Sale believes Andersen expressed his feelings of social and sexual inferiority by creating characters that are inferior to their beloveds. [[The Little Mermaid]], for example, has no soul while her human beloved has a soul as his birthright. In “Thumbelina”, Andersen suggests the toad, the beetle, and the mole are Thumbelina's inferiors and should remain in their places rather than wanting their superior. Sale indicates they are not inferior to Thumbelina but simply ''different''. He suggests that Andersen may have done some damage to the animal world when he colored his animal characters with his own feelings of inferiority.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Sale|1978|pp=65–68}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Jacqueline Banerjee views the tale as a failure story. “Not surprisingly,“ she writes, “”Thumbelina“ is now often read as a story of specifically female empowerment.“&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.victorianweb.org/genre/childlit/fairytales3.html |last=Banerjee |first=Jacqueline |year=2008 |title=The Power of "Faerie": Hans Christian Andersen as a Children's Writer |publisher=The Victorian Web: Literature, History, &amp; Culture in the Age of Victoria |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Susie Stephens believes Thumbelina herself is a grotesque, and observes that “the grotesque in children’s literature is [...] a necessary and beneficial component that enhances the psychological welfare of the young reader“. Children are attracted to the cathartic qualities of the grotesque, she suggests.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://davidlavery.net/grotesque/The_Grotesque_In/grotesquechildrensliterature.html |last=Stephens |first=Susie |title=The Grotesque in Children’s Literature |accessdate=2009-08-22}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sidney Rosenblatt in his essay "Thumbelina and the Development of Female Sexuality" believes the tale may be analyzed, from the perspective of [[Psychosexual development|Freudian psychoanalysis]], as the story of female masturbation.  Thumbelina herself, he posits, could symbolize the clitoris, her rose petal coverlet the labia, the white butterfly "the budding genitals", and the mole and the prince the anal and vaginal openings respectively.&lt;ref&gt;{{Harvnb|Siegel|1998|pp=123,126}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adaptations==

===Animation===
The earliest animated version of the tale is a silent, black-and-white release by director Herbert M. Dawley in 1924.&lt;ref name="IMDb7"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0015411/|title=Thumbelina (1924)|date=27 September 1924|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Lotte Reiniger]] released a 10-minute cinematic adaptation in 1954 featuring her "[[silhouette]]" puppets.&lt;ref name="IMDb6"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0213627/|title=Däumlienchen (1954)|author=boblipton|date=13 October 2013|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1964 [[Soyuzmultfilm]] released ''[[:ru:Дюймовочка (мультфильм, 1964)|Dyuymovochka]]'', a half-hour Russian adaptation of the fairy tale directed by [[Leonid Amalrik]].&lt;ref name="IMDb5"&gt;{{cite web|url= https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0188580/ |title=Dyuymovochka (1964) |author=TheLittleSongbird |date=19 October 2013 |work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although the screenplay by [[Nikolai Erdman]] stayed faithful to the story, it was noted for satirical characters and dialogues (many of them turned into catchphrases).&lt;ref&gt;Petr Bagrov.

From Hans Christian to Christian Hans]'' article from [[:ru:Сеанс (журнал)|Seance]] № 25/26, 2005 {{ISSN|0136-0108}} (in Russian)&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1983, a Japanese version was released called ''Oyayubihime (Princess Thumb)'';&lt;ref name="IMDb1"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0456456/|title=H.C. Andersens eventyrlige verden: Tommelise (Video 2005) - IMDb|date=29 March 2005|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; 世界名作童話 おやゆび姫 ''(Sekai Meisaku Dōwa Oyayubi-hime; World Classic Fairytale Princess Thumb)'', a [[Toei Animation]] [[anime]] movie, with character designs by [[Tezuka Osamu]] from 1978. In 1992, The [[Golden Films]] released of ''[[Thumbelina (1992 film)|Thumbelina]]'' (1992),&lt;ref name="IMDb3"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0135000/|title=Thumbelina (Video 1992)|author=TheLittleSongbird|date=8 June 1992|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; and ''[[Tom Thumb Meets Thumbelina]]'' afterwards. A Japanese animated series adapted the plot, and made it into a movie, ''[[Thumbelina: A Magical Story]]'' (1992), released in 1993.&lt;ref name="AnimeEncyc"&gt;{{cite book |last=Clements |first=Jonathan |authorlink=Jonathan Clements |author2=[[Helen McCarthy]]  |title=The Anime Encyclopedia: A Guide to Japanese Animation Since 1917 |date=2001-09-01 |publisher=Stone Bridge Press |location=Berkeley, California |isbn=1-880656-64-7 |oclc=47255331 |page=399 |edition=1st }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1994, [[Warner Bros.|Warner Brothers]] released the animated film ''[[Thumbelina (1994 film)|Thumbelina]]'' (1994),&lt;ref name="IMDb2"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0111419/|title=Thumbelina (1994)|author=MissyBaby|date=30 March 1994|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt; directed by [[Don Bluth]] and [[Gary Goldman]], with [[Jodi Benson]] as the voice of Thumbelina. 

The 2002 direct-to-DVD animated movie, ''[[The Adventures of Tom Thumb and Thumbelina]]'', brought together the two most famous tiny people of literature, with Thumbelina voiced by [[Jennifer Love Hewitt]].&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0185143/ ''The Adventures of Tom Thumb &amp; Thumbelina''], Internet Movie Database. Accessed Oct. 24, 2011.&lt;/ref&gt; 

The 2009 direct-to-DVD animated movie, ''[[Barbie Thumbelina|Barbie Presents Thumbelina]]'', where [[Barbie]] tells the story of the Twillerbees, with Thumbelina as the main character.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=https://www.amazon.com/dp/B001O3M370 |title=Barbie Thumbelina |publisher=[[Amazon.com]] |accessdate=2014-01-17}}&lt;/ref&gt; in a modern-day tale. She meets Makena, the daughter of a wealthy couple, who became the Twillerbees' only hope for saving their home (which was being torn down due to a building construction by Makena's parents). At the end, Barbie waves at Thumbelina and her friends before the Twillerbees magically make a plant grow in the sight of a little girl, revealing it is a true story.

In 2015, a modernized version of Thumbelina appears in the [[Disney Junior]] series, ''[[Goldie and Bear]]''. In the episode ''Thumbelina's Wild Ride'',&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt5339018/|title=Thumbulina's Wild Ride/Big Bad House Guest|author=|date=10 December 2015|publisher=|via=www.imdb.com}}&lt;/ref&gt; Thumbelina (voiced by [[Debby Ryan]] with her singing voice provided by [[Shannon Chan-Kent]]) is hired to [[babysit]] for Goldie and Bear. The two friends are initially put off by her small stature, thinking she's almost helpless. When she tries getting the kids a snack, she falls down the kitchen sink and slides into the river behind the house. Goldie and Bear try to save her, but soon see that Thumbelina is resourceful, agile, and can lift several times her own weight. She saves herself from the river and even rescues the kids when they fall in trying to save her. The kids take an instant liking to Thumbelina and can't wait for the next time she babysits.

===Live action===
On June 11, 1985, a television dramatization of [[Thumbelina (Faerie Tale Theatre episode)|the tale was broadcast]] as the 12th episode of the [[television anthology series|anthology series]] ''[[Faerie Tale Theatre]]''. The production starred [[Carrie Fisher]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.dvdverdict.com/printer/faerietaletheatre.php|title=DVD Verdict Review - Shelley Duvall's Faerie Tale Theatre: The Complete Collection|work=dvdverdict.com|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110617011745/http://www.dvdverdict.com/printer/faerietaletheatre.php|archivedate=2011-06-17|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt;

A version of the tale was filmed in 1970 as an advertisement for "[[Pirates World]]", a now-defunct Florida theme park. Directed by [[Barry Mahon]] and with [[Shay Garner]] in the title role, this version was reused in its entirety as filler material for "Santa Claus and the Ice Cream Bunny", a rival to such films as "Plan 9 from Outer Space" and "Manos: the Hands of Fate" for the title of most inept film ever made.&lt;ref name="IMDb8"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://www.imdb.com/title/tt0134149/|title=Thumbelina (1970)|author=emasterslake|date=15 January 2011|work=IMDb}}&lt;/ref&gt;

{{maplink|frame=yes|frame-width=220|zoom=14|type=point}}
'''Tianzifang''' or '''Tianzi Fang''' ({{zh|c=田子坊|p=Tiánzǐ Fāng}}; [[Shanghainese]]: ''Deedzɿ Fãː'') is a touristic arts and crafts enclave that has developed from a renovated traditional residential area in the [[French Concession]] area of [[Shanghai]].&lt;ref name="lonelyplanet"&gt;{{cite book|first=Christopher | last=Pitts| title=Pocket Shanghai | publisher=[[Lonely Planet]] | isbn=978-1-74179-963-7 | date=April 2013 |edition=3rd | pages=58–59 | chapter=Top Sights: Tianzifang }}&lt;/ref&gt; It is now home to boutique shops, bars and restaurants.

==Overview==
The district comprises a neighborhood of labyrinthine alleyways off Taikang Road ({{zh|c=泰康路|p=Tàikāng Lù}}), a short street which is today mostly known only for Tianzi Fang. Tianzi Fang is known for small craft stores, coffee shops, trendy art studios and narrow alleys.  It has become a popular tourist destination in Shanghai, and an example of preservation of local [[Shikumen]] architecture. It is sometimes compared to [[Xintiandi]], though in the latter precinct most of the houses were demolished and rebuilt, rather than renovated.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Rising Taikanglu |newspaper=China Daily |url=http://www.chinadaily.com.cn/citylife/2006-12/01/content_748013.htm}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tianzi Fang is largely hidden from the neighbouring streets, as it grew from the inside of the block outward, although there are now shops on Taikang Road itself.  Historically Lane #248 was a key entrance that, in order to gain access to the commercially developed area, required walking about 50m through whilst be surrounded by local residents' life, including bicycles, hanging laundry, etc. until finally emerging in the 'new' area.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=A High-Fashion Lane in Shanghai|newspaper=New York Times |url=http://travel.nytimes.com/2007/03/04/travel/04surfacing1.html | first=Andrew | last=Yang | date=2007-03-04 | accessdate=2010-05-24}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
The neighborhood centres on a block of [[Shikumen]] residential development dating from 1933. The shikumen complex was named "Zhicheng Fang", where "Zhicheng" meant "realisation of ambition" while "Fang" meant "neighbourhood" and was a common suffix for shikumen estates. Today's Tianzi Fang precinct covers not only the former Zhicheng Fang, but also other adjoining houses, apartments and industrial buildings of various styles.

Located near the eastern end of the Zhaojiabang canal and the southern edge of the [[Shanghai French Concession]], it was in the relatively downmarket part of the Concession. In 1954, the canal was filled in and the former canal basin became a busy transport interchange. Zhicheng Fang remained an ordinary residential neighbourhood until the last quarter of the 20th century, when the cheap rent but convenient location attracted artists to set up studios there. In 1998, the formerly busy wet market on Taikang Road was moved indoors. In 2001, the precinct was redesignated an artistic and creative quarter, drawing on its former popularity with artists. At the same time, the whole precinct was given the name "Tianzi Fang", a pun on Tian Zifang, a figure from the [[Warring States period]] and often referred to as China's earliest recorded artist. In 2006 it was slated for demolition to make way for redevelopment. Opposition among local business owners and residents, as well as a famous artist [[Chen Yifei]] who had a studio in Tianzifang, in addition to a group submitted a proposal to the local government to preserve the Taikang Road area and its traditional architecture and ambience.

Rezoning of Tianzi Fang into a tourist precinct began in 2005/2006 with nearby art schools and studios, and later small international business owners found out about Tianzi Fang through the local grapevine. Its development began very slowly with local merchants, a New Zealand store, Japanese restaurants, and a tea house setting up in the district. From the beginning of 2007, journalists, visitors and local residents began to visit the area and spread the word about a cosy little lane district that housed some interesting and creative businesses. Additional articles in both local and foreign media such as the [[New York Times]] helped increase awareness of this older and unusual community, that stood out among the more modern and commercial shopping areas of Shanghai.

==Today==
Tianzifang has become a major tourist attraction&lt;ref name="lonelyplanet" /&gt; and has more than 200 diverse small businesses such as cafes, bars, restaurants, art galleries, craft stores, design houses and studios, and even French bistros. It is adjacent to the SML center which is among the largest shopping malls in Shanghai upon completion.  It is also near the [[Shanghai Metro]] [[Line 9, Shanghai Metro|Line 9]]'s [[Dapuqiao Station]] which is immediately to the south.

Despite all the businesses selling trendy craft and some foreign goods, the area does not have the look of having been overly beautified - electricity cables are still strung overhead, and air conditioning units are obvious on the outside of the buildings. The district is distinctly different from [[Xintiandi]], another Shikumen redevelopment in central Shanghai further to the northeast, in that it has managed to preserve its residential feel, adding to its appeal.

'''VisionIntoArt''' is a non-profit new music and interdisciplinary arts production company in New York City.  The group was founded in 1999 by Nora Kroll-Rosenbaum and Paola Prestini, while students at the [[Juilliard]] School.

== History ==

VIA’s first performance was in a dance studio at [[Juilliard]] in 1998 when a group of dancers, musicians, actors, and filmmakers sought to create performance work that investigated world culture.  They have since performed and toured globally at venues such as [[Lincoln Center]], Symphony Space, the [[Brooklyn Academy of Music]], the [[Whitney Museum]], and at international festivals.  VIA has won numerous awards and grants from organizations such as LMCC, the [[Nathan Cummings Foundation]], the Council on Foundations, and the [[American Music Center]].  During the first ten years, the group toured and performed with artists across a wide array of mediums such as poet [[Roger Bonair-Agard]], artist Erika Harrsch, and videographer [[Carmen Kordas]].  VIA has recently restructured the organization, acting as a production organization and less as a performance ensemble. 2009 saw the first collaboration between Beth Morrison Projects, Opera on Tap and VisionIntoArt for a production of 21c Liederabend, an evening of song by 21st-century composers.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Giovetti|first=Olivia|url=http://newyork.timeout.com/music-nightlife/classical-opera/55756/21c-liederabend|title=21c Liederabend|publisher=Time Out New York}}&lt;/ref&gt;  And in 2011, the organization announced its first grants program under the name The Balsamo Career Grant as well as a residency program produced in coordination with Under the Volcano, a writers workshop located in Tepoztlán, Mexico.

'''''The Warrior of Capestrano''''' is a tall [[limestone]] statue of a [[Picentes|Picene]] warrior, dated to around the 6th century BC. The statue stands at around 2.09 m. It was discovered accidentally in 1934 by a labourer ploughing the field in the Italian town of [[Capestrano]], along with a female statue in civilian attire, called ''Lady of Capestrano''.&lt;ref name="Basile"&gt;{{cite web | url =https://www.academia.edu/959298/The_Capestrano_Warrior_and_Related_Monuments_of_the_Seventh_to_Fifth_Centuries_B.C| title =The Capestrano Warrior and Related Monuments of the Seventh to Fifth Centuries B.C. |author=Joe Basile|website=Revue des archéologues et historiens d’art de Louvain|publisher=[[Academia.edu]]|date=1993| accessdate =30 August 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Description==
''The Warrior'' statue has traces of pink paint, and features a warrior wearing a hat with a huge brim, and a disk-type armor (''[[kardiophylax]]'') protecting his chest and back,&lt;ref name="Basile"/&gt; a wide belt, necklace, and armlets. Additionally, the warrior bears a short sword, knife, axe, and a defensive device known to the Greeks as ''mitra'' (a short apron covering the back).

A [[South Picene language|South Picene]] inscription incised on the pillar standing to the right of the warrior reads: "''Makupri koram opsút aninis rakinevíi pomp[úne]í''" ("Aninis had this statue made most excellently for Rakinewis, the Pomp[onian]").{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

Investigation subsequent to the statue's discovery revealed that the vineyard where the statue was found was situated above an [[Iron Age]] cemetery.{{citation needed|date=January 2017}}

'''Winifred''' "'''Fred'''" '''Burkle''' is a fictional [[Character (arts)|character]] created by [[Joss Whedon]] and introduced by [[Shawn Ryan]] and [[Mere Smith]] on the [[television series]] ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]''.  The character is portrayed by [[Amy Acker]].

==Biography==

===Character history===
Fred was born in [[San Antonio]], [[Texas]] to Roger and Patricia "Trish" Burkle.  When she finished college, she moved to [[Los Angeles]] for graduate school at [[UCLA]].  Originally majoring in history, Fred took a [[physics]] class with Professor Seidel, which inspired her to take another path.  Around this time, she began working at Stewart Brunell Public Library.  In 1996, while shelving a demon language book, a curious Fred recited the [[wikt:cryptic|cryptic]] text out loud and was accidentally sucked into a dimensional portal to [[Pylea]] (her future friend [[Lorne (Angel)|Lorne]] was sucked into the same portal on his side and ended up in Los Angeles).  It was later discovered that the portal was actually opened by Fred's jealous college professor, Professor Seidel, who had sent every promising student to it, essentially sending them to their death.  Fred was the only one of at least six to return (cf. "[[Supersymmetry (Angel episode)|Supersymmetry]]").  In high school or college, Fred was a [[marijuana]] user as shown in the episode "[[Spin the Bottle (Angel)|Spin the Bottle]]".  In that episode, she asks Wesley and "Liam" for weed and was also revealed to have had to take a [[personality disorder]] test and to be something of a [[Conspiracy theory|conspiracy theorist]].

===Angel Investigations===
For five years, Fred spent an arduous life as a "cow", the [[Pylea]]n word for humans who are kept as [[slaves]], and then as a fugitive.  The harsh life of solitude and [[serf]]dom took a serious toll on her [[social skills]], as well as her [[mental health]]; when Angel meets Fred, she is curled up in a cave, scribbling on the already-covered walls, having seemingly convinced herself that her previous life in L.A. had not been real.

It was revealed that Fred had once been forced to wear an explosive shock collar.  However, Fred's salvation comes when [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]] and his crew arrive in Pylea to find [[Cordelia Chase]], who had become trapped there.  It is notable that when Angel's demon came fully to the fore, it attacked just about everyone ''but'' Fred – including Gunn and Wesley.  Despite this shocking display of violence, Angel never seemed to scare Fred, and even at his most demonic, he never attacked her.  In fact, her presence seemed to have a calming effect on him.

When Pylea is liberated, Fred accompanies Angel and the rest of the gang back to Los Angeles and stays in the [[Hyperion Hotel]] to re-adjust to life on Earth and regain her mental stability.  Despite several traumatic instances, such as being held hostage by [[Charles Gunn (Angel)|Gunn]]'s old [[vampire]]-hunting crew, she adjusts quite well to "normal" life.

Her knowledge of physics and mathematics make her an excellent asset when researching and developing strategies.  Fred quickly develops a romantic relationship with Gunn, which lasts roughly one year.  She is also the object of affection of [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce]], who attempts to step aside after Gunn and Fred started dating, but is still drawn to her.  Near the end of her relationship with Gunn, Fred and Wesley share a kiss, but after discovering that Wesley had been in a relationship – albeit a rather complex one – with [[Lilah Morgan]], her feelings for Wesley cool considerably.

Eventually, Fred discovers that it was actually her former professor's fault that she had been trapped in Pylea, and indeed, Professor Seidel had attempted to trap her in another world yet again.  Furious, she plots to kill him with Wesley's help.  Gunn, however, feels that such a brutal act, even against Seidel, will ultimately destroy her.  As a result, in a battle where she is trying to trap him in a hell dimension, Gunn snaps Seidel's neck himself and drops the body into the portal.  Unfortunately, this causes a rift between Fred and Gunn, and ultimately ends their relationship.

===Wolfram &amp; Hart===
However, everything changes for Fred when she and the rest of Angel's crew join [[Wolfram &amp; Hart]]. (While Angel accepts a suite of rooms at Wolfram &amp; Hart as his new home, Fred, and maybe others of the inner circle, find a home in the Los Angeles area: hers is at 511 Windward Circle.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url= http://www.buffyworld.com/angel/transcripts/102_tran.html |author= Edlund, Ben |authorlink= Ben Edlund |date= February 18, 2004 |title= Angel Transcript: "Smile Time", 5x14— Episode #102 |publisher= BuffyWorld |accessdate= September 30, 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt; This seems to be forgotten with the advent of Illyria.)  Her memory is altered by a spell cast in Season Four's last episode, "[[Home (Angel)|Home]]", and it is unclear how much of the events of Seasons Three and Four she remembers differently or at all (everything specific to Angel's son [[Connor (Angel)|Connor]] is definitely lost).  Fred receives her own laboratory and becomes the head of [[Wolfram &amp; Hart]]'s Science Division.  She is a major asset to the team; Angel consistently relies on her department to quickly and efficiently solve problems.  After going on a few dates with co-worker [[List of minor Angel characters#Knox|Knox]], Fred begins to have feelings for Wesley again.  The pair are together for about a week, but the couple's happiness is not to last.

A mysterious [[sarcophagus]], allowed through customs by a signature from Gunn, appears in the lab.  As Fred examines it, a hole opens in the cover and a breath of wind blows into her face.  It turns out that the sarcophagus is a holding cell for one of the original, pure-breed demons known as the [[Old Ones (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Old Ones]], which is predestined to rise again.  The air Fred inhales is actually [[Illyria (Angel)|Illyria's]] essence, which immediately begins a parasitic existence in her body, eating away at it and making her a shell.  Worse still, Knox had worshipped Illyria for years and worked at Wolfram &amp; Hart for the sole purpose of bringing the demon back.  Because of his affections for Fred, he chose her as the only one "worthy" to house his god.

As Angel and [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] travel to England to find a cure, Wesley remains in Fred's bedroom with her, comforting her as she fights bravely, but slowly begins to die.  Angel learns that the only way to save Fred would be to draw Illyria back to the Deeper Well in England by using her sarcophagus as a beacon.  However, thousands of others would die as Illyria's essence cut across the world back to the Well.  Thus, Angel and Spike are forced to do nothing, deciding that Fred would not want this.

As she lies dying, Fred's mind begins to give way.  Nearing the end, she panics, stating that Feigenbaum, a stuffed rabbit named for mathematical physicist [[Mitchell Feigenbaum]] who studied [[chaos theory]], should be there.  When Wesley asks her who Feigenbaum is, Fred replies that she doesn't know.  Cradling her in his arms, Wesley stays with Fred until the moment she dies, after which her body is taken over by Illyria.  "Wesley, why can't I stay?" are Fred's last words.

According to Dr. Sparrow, Fred's soul is consumed by the fires of resurrection, which Wesley interprets upon overhearing as soul destruction, seemingly making it impossible for her to return from the dead or enjoy an afterlife, although the specifics of this process are not elaborated.  Later, though, Illyria states that there are remnants of Fred in the form of her memories, which are a source of confusion for Illyria.  On occasion, Illyria takes on the appearance of Fred in order to go about unnoticed and to deal with Fred's parents.  When Wesley dies, Illyria takes on Fred's form to comfort him and because she has Fred's form, the evil warlock Cyvus Vail underestimates her and she easily kills him.

Had ''Angel'' gotten a sixth season, Joss Whedon originally intended for Fred and Illyria to either be split in two as revealed by Amy Acker in an interview: "As I’m playing this new character now, it was just some stuff that he was going to do with her and bringing Fred back and getting to work with both characters",&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |title= [[dreamwatch]] no.115 |publisher= [[Titan Magazines]] |date=April 2004 }}&lt;/ref&gt; or for Illyria to take on more and more of Fred's memories.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20081218052015/http://www.stuffwelike.com/stuffwelike/2008/12/15/amy-acker-from-angel-to-dollhouse-part-1|title=Amy Acker: From Angel to Dollhouse (Part 1) {{!}} StuffWeLike.com|date=2008-12-18|access-date=2018-02-02}}&lt;/ref&gt;

=== After the Fall ===
Fred seemingly reappears in the fifth, sixth and ninth issues of ''[[Angel: After The Fall]]'', manifesting as a transformation of [[Illyria (Angel)|Illyria]] into not just the physical appearance of Fred, but also her personality.  This happens a first time upon the initial fusion of [[Hell]] and [[Los Angeles|L.A.]] and then a second time upon a reunion of Illyria and [[Wesley Wyndam Price|Wesley]].  Issue #9 reveals that the Illyria and Fred essences have been struggling for dominance over their shared body, and that [[Spike (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Spike]] has been trying to suppress Fred's manifestations (even going so far as to ask Angel for help), and admits that he would have kept Illyria away from the battle had he known Wesley was going to be present.  It is later revealed in ''Spike: After the Fall'' that seeing someone Fred cared for triggers the change, while dangerous situations transform her back into Illyria.  However, issue #14 explains that the Fred manifestations were just Illyria's interpretation of Fred; with these remnants lost, Illyria reverts to her true form.  Later the telepath [[List of minor Angel characters#Betta George|Betta George]] puts Wesley and Spike's memories (of Fred) into Illyria's brain to make her question her own actions.  Illyria later tries to behave in such a way as Fred would have wanted, and has taken on more of her characteristics (for example, in the ''After the Fall Epilogue'' she has scrawled on the walls of her rooms as Fred did, albeit listing methods of killing).

After the Senior Partners rewind time after Angel is killed by Gunn, Angel renames a wing of the L.A. public library the "Burkle Wyndam-Pryce Wing" in honor of Fred and Wesley.

=== ''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' Season Nine ===

In [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Nine|''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' Season Nine]], Illyria is drained of her mystical energy and powers and is stuck in the physical appearance of Fred.  Illyria believes she should be dead and something inside her must be keeping her alive, and is able to scientifically read graphs to determine why [[Dawn Summers]] is dying. Illyria expresses human compassion for Severin, the person who drained her and who is now about to explode with power.  Illyria stays with Severin as he uses his powers to restore magic to the world which also vaporizes himself and Illyria.  Scott Allie later stated it was intentionally left open to interpretation as to whether Fred was influencing Illyria.

Buffy later expresses regret to her noble companion Eldre Koh on the need to destroy Illyria. Koh casts doubt on Buffy's knowledge of the elder ones.&lt;ref&gt;''Buffy the Vampire Slayer'' Season 10 #2 (April 23 2014)&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Resurrection ===

Fred is later discovered alive on the streets of London by Angel.&lt;ref&gt;''Angel &amp; Faith'' Season Ten #10 (January 7 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; It transpires that, when magic was restored, many aspects of the supernatural were "reset", resulting in the resurrection of both Fred and Illyria, sharing the same body.&lt;ref&gt;''Angel &amp; Faith'' Season Ten #11 (February 4 2015)&lt;/ref&gt; Fred and Illyria thereafter remain with Angel for the remainder  of Season 10 and throughout ''Angel'' [[Buffy the Vampire Slayer Season Eleven|Season 11]].

==Powers and abilities==
Fred is a normal human woman with no supernatural abilities; however, her brilliant mathematical mind, immense knowledge of [[quantum physics]] and science, and a natural ability in designing inventions make her an important asset of [[Angel (Buffy the Vampire Slayer)|Angel]]'s team; [[Wesley Wyndam-Pryce|Wesley]] once says, while addressing most of Angel's crew, "She's smarter than all of us put together".  Due to spending so many years in Pylea, she also has a limited knowledge of the Pylean language and culture.

During this time, Fred also acquires some reasonably good fighting skills, mainly with weapons such as stakes, guns, swords, knives, etc.  Later, when Jasmine takes over Los Angeles, she's forced to face down all of Los Angeles on her own, and it is shown that she is also able to hold her own unarmed, effortlessly taking out a few armed Jasminites, including one armed SWAT member.  It's seen in Season Three that she likes plants, actually talking to them during her period of mild insanity.  In the episode "[[Spin the Bottle (Angel episode)|Spin the Bottle]]," while she's under the effect of a magical spell, Fred is briefly fascinated with a fern.  After undergoing the transformation to [[Illyria (Angel)|Illyria]], she can talk to plants while at full power.

Fred is also portrayed as an innocent, unassuming young woman, which often leads people to underestimate her.  On many occasions, she has used this to her advantage, such as shocking Connor with a [[Electroshock weapon|stun gun]] and knocking out a suspicious lab assistant at Wolfram &amp; Hart or in the third season in "[[That Old Gang of Mine (Angel episode)|That Old Gang of Mine]]" when she tricks Gunn's old gang into thinking she was going to kill Angel.  Also, she shows signs of great inner strength and an innate ability to survive on her own despite overwhelming circumstances.  This is shown in Season Four as she attempts to flee from Jasmine's followers, and earlier with her experiences in Pylea.

== Appearances ==

=== Canonical appearances ===
Fred has 64 canonical Angel appearances overall:
;''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'':
The character of Fred appeared in the final four Season Two episodes of ''[[Angel (1999 TV series)|Angel]]'' ("[[Belonging (Angel)|Belonging]]", "[[Over the Rainbow (Angel)|Over the Rainbow]]", "[[Through the Looking Glass (Angel)|Through the Looking Glass]]", "[[There's No Place Like Plrtz Glrb]]") before becoming a regular in Season Three, until her death in "[[A Hole in the World]]" (episode 15 season 5), although her body continued to appear as the 'host' of Illyria.  She appears in a total of 63 episodes (2001–2004).
;''[[Angel: After the Fall]]'':
In the final page of [[Angel: After the Fall]] #5, it appears that Illyria turns into Fred after noticing Wesley&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference | writer=[[Brian Lynch (writer)|Lynch, Brian]] | penciller=[[Franco Urru|Urru, Franco]] | story= | title=[[Angel: After the Fall]] | volume=1 | issue=5 | date=March 19, 2008 | publisher=[[IDW Publishing]] }}&lt;/ref&gt; and issue 9 shows her transforming back and forth between Fred and Illyria.  However, this is later noted in issue #15 as a misguide.  Illyria had been in control of the body the entire time, as well as Fred being dead the entire time.&lt;ref&gt;{{Comic book reference | writer=[[Brian Lynch (writer)|Lynch, Brian]] | penciller=[[Nick Runge|Runge, Nick]] | story= | title=[[Angel: After the Fall]] | volume=1 | issue=9 | date=June 19, 2008 | publisher=[[IDW Publishing]] }}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Woodstock Mural''''' is a [[mural]] designed by artist Mike Lawrence, painted on the west side of the [[New Seasons Market]] store in the [[Woodstock, Portland, Oregon|Woodstock]] neighborhood of [[Portland, Oregon]], in the United States. The painting has three sections, each representing a theme: commerce, education, and the outdoors. It depicts figures adorned with symbolism related to characters in [[Greek mythology]], including [[Hermes]], [[Athena]], and [[Demeter]], along with local businesses and local landmarks such as the neighborhood [[farmers' market]], [[Grand Central Bakery]], Portland Fish Market, [[Woodstock Park (Portland, Oregon)|Woodstock Park]], and the [[Woodstock Library]].

The Woodstock Neighborhood Association (WNA) originally made plans for a mural on the exterior wall of [[Lutz Tavern]]. Following an outreach effort to identify an artist, Lawrence and WNA met for a brainstorming session, during which they agreed on theme's for the proposed public artwork. Even after some funding was secured, efforts stalled. The association later proposed a mural for the nearby Red Fox Vintage building.

The original mural was completed on the Red Fox Vintage building by Heidi Schultz in November 2013. However, shortly after its completion, New Seasons announced the construction of a new grocery store next to the mural. The company offered to reproduce the painting on the east side of an adjacent building or the west side of the planned building. Dan Cohen and his assistant were hired to reproduce the mural, which was completed in October 2015.

Commerce, represented on the left side, is depicted by a shopkeeper wearing a hat with the wings of [[Hermes]], the Greek god of commerce (or, according to some sources, [[Mercury (mythology)|Mercury]], the Roman god of commerce).&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; The business owner is bearded and wears a [[crocus]] flower in his apron. He has a tattoo of the [[caduceus]], the staff carried by [[Hermes Trismegistus]] in [[Egyptian mythology]] and Hermes in Greek mythology.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt; In his store is a shelf with other symbolic items that represent local businesses.&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt;

The center section is devoted to education and depicts [[Athena]], the Greek goddess of wisdom, in the form of a girl in the [[Woodstock Library]].&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; She is adorned with an owl on her shoulder and an [[olive branch]] necklace. She holds a tiger lily in her hand. [[Woodstock School (Portland, Oregon)|Woodstock School]]'s Mandarin Immersion Program is honored with an arc of [[Chinese characters]] above the girl's head, written on a chalkboard. The [[Mandarin Chinese]] text translates to "A nice place to live"&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt; or "It's a great place to live", which is Woodstock's motto.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; According to ''The Bee'', the central section also represents other neighborhood schools and the neighborhood's close proximity to [[Reed College]].&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt;

The mural's right section depicts [[Demeter]], the Greek goddess of the harvest, in the form of an Asian female urban farmer at the neighborhood [[farmers' market]]. She wears [[Poppy (flower)|poppies]] in her headdress, giving the appearance of a crown, and has a tattoo of a [[Sheaf (agriculture)|sheaf]] of wheat. Next to her is a [[cornucopia]], which symbolizes abundance and nourishment. She holds a lotus staff, described as a "flaming torch".&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; The figure also represents "the love of gardening". [[Douglas fir]] trees and [[Woodstock Park (Portland, Oregon)|Woodstock Park]], specifically its off-leash dog area, are also depicted in the painting's right section.&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt;

==History==
[[File:Lutz Tavern (2014) - 1.jpg|thumb|left|The mural was originally planned for the exterior wall of [[Lutz Tavern]].]]

The Woodstock Neighborhood Association (WNA) originally made plans to paint a community mural on the east exterior of [[Lutz Tavern]].&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; Following an outreach effort to locate an artist, WNA and Lawrence held a brainstorming session. Kenny Heggem, who served as the project manager of the mural committee,&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Outreach &amp; Communications|url=http://woodstockpdx.org/committees/communications/|publisher=Woodstock Neighborhood Association|accessdate=November 7, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; recalled, "We talked about our fantastic park and its leash-free dog area, Woodstock Elementary's Mandarin Immersion Program, and our awesome library."&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt; The session resulted in the group's choosing the mural's three themes.&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt;

In August 2012, RACC confirmed funding of $6,000 for the {{Convert|60|ft|m|adj=on}} x {{Convert|15|ft|m|adj=on}} painting. The mural's design was divided into three parts to accommodate the exterior wall's three sections. RACC published an image of Lawrence's proposed mural and said the goal of the project was to "highlight the best of the neighborhood and instill a sense of community pride".&lt;ref name=Six&gt;{{cite web|title=Portland will add six new public art murals to its collection this summer|url=https://racc.org/2012/08/10/portland-will-add-six-new-public-art-murals-to-its-collection-this-summer/|publisher=Regional Arts &amp; Culture Council|accessdate=November 7, 2015|date=August 10, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; The agency also said the project was still raising funds and hoped to start in the spring of 2013.&lt;ref name=Six/&gt; Efforts stalled, but WNA later proposed a mural with a different design for the east side of the Red Fox Vintage building, located at the intersection of Southeast 46th Avenue and Southeast Woodstock Boulevard.&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt;

According to the ''[[Portland Tribune]]'', the project was a collaboration between local businesses, institutions, and neighborhood residents. Beaver State Scaffolding and [[Sherwin-Williams]] both contributed resources to the project.&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; RACC awarded partial grant funding through its Public Art Murals Program, which is funded by the City of Portland and "provides funding for community murals that reflect diversity in style and media and encourages artists from diverse backgrounds and range of experience to apply".&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Six/&gt; WNA volunteers also assisted, led by Heggem and Becky Luening, head of the neighborhood association.&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt;&lt;ref name=Binder&gt;{{cite news|last=Binder|first=Melissa|title=New Seasons in Woodstock: Neighborhood mural will be replicated, traffic guided by audible, visual signals (Q&amp;A)|url=http://www.oregonlive.com/portland/index.ssf/2014/03/new_seasons_in_woodstock_updat.html|accessdate=November 7, 2015|work=[[The Oregonian]]|publisher=[[Advance Publications]]|issn=8750-1317|date=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Heidi Schultz of Schultz Art &amp; Design served as the project's production manager.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; She created a pattern against the wall using Lawrence's digital design, then mixed the paint, completed the mural, and added a clear coating for protection.&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; Painting the mural took about six weeks, and it was mostly finished by November 2013.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; Red Fox Vintage hosted a party to celebrate the work's completion on December 14.&lt;ref name=Finally/&gt; The mural took nearly two years to plan and complete, which was longer than expected.&lt;ref name=RACC/&gt;&lt;ref name=Binder/&gt;

Not long after the mural's completion, New Seasons Market announced plans to build a new store immediately adjacent to the mural.&lt;ref name=Binder/&gt; In January 2014, the co-owner of Red Fox Vintage, said, "We're going to have a sit-down with New Seasons about the mural. To the best of my knowledge, New Seasons will make it right."&lt;ref name=Official&gt;{{cite news|last1=MacKinnon|first1=Merry|title=Finally official: New Seasons IS coming to Woodstock|url=http://pamplinmedia.com/sb/75-features/209044-66200-finally-official-new-seasons-is-coming-to-woodstock|accessdate=November 7, 2015|work=The Bee|date=January 31, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; She shared three options to discuss with the company: repainting the mural on Red Fox's east wall, transferring it to the new store's exterior wall, or keeping the original mural in place and making it visible from the grocery store's interior.&lt;ref name=Official/&gt;

New Seasons met with WNA and offered to reproduce the painting, either on the east side of the Red Fox Vintage building or the west side of the planned grocery store.&lt;ref name=Binder/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|last1=Binder|first1=Melissa|title=New Seasons Woodstock|url=http://photos.oregonlive.com/oregonian/2014/03/new_seasons_woodstock.html|accessdate=November 7, 2015|work=The Oregonian|date=March 10, 2014}}&lt;/ref&gt; Luening said the latter option was more practical, because the artist could paint on panels in her studio instead of working outside.&lt;ref name=Binder/&gt; New Seasons hired Dan Cohen of Dan Cohen Creative Labs to duplicate the mural using a method similar to one he uses in his work as a "mega mural" painter. He said of the process: &lt;blockquote&gt;I paint giant advertising murals all over the country. I do about one mural a month. We create the pattern using the original image, and paint on top of it. We use a special machine [to create the underlying design] that works like an arc welder.&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

During construction of the new building and the mural's transfer, New Seasons displayed a banner which read, "The mural will return".&lt;ref name=Ashton&gt;{{cite news|last1=Ashton|first1=David F.|title=Woodstock's New Seasons to open October 21|url=http://portlandtribune.com/sb/75-features/275290-150504-woodstocks-new-seasons-to-open-october-21|accessdate=November 7, 2015|work=The Bee|date=October 2, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt; Cohen and his assistant, Christo Wunderlich, transferred the design using a machine, then painted the art by hand. The duo also added bread and a fish to the mural to represent the local businesses [[Grand Central Bakery]] and Portland Fish Market, respectively.&lt;ref name=Bee/&gt; The new store opened in October 2015.&lt;ref name=Ashton/&gt;
