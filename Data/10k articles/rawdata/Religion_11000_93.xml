'''Babacar Khane''' (born January 2, 1935), also known as Yogi Khane, Yogi Babacar Khane and Maître Khane, is a practitioner of [[yoga]], author, and mystical poet.{{citation needed|date=September 2012}} His work has focused on the diffusion of yoga in Europe and its introduction into medical treatments. He founded the International Yoga Institute and an international yoga teacher training school, active now in Africa, America, Asia and Europe. He introduced a new way of teaching yoga based on Indian [[Hatha yoga]] [[asana]]s, Egyptian postures and Chinese exercises attributed by the [[Shaolin Temple|Shaolin]] monks to [[Bodhidharma]].&lt;ref&gt;About the three aspects of Khane's yoga teaching, see Jean-François Mayer, ''Les nouvelles voies spirituelles'', Nationales Forschungsprogramm 21—Kulturelle Vielfalt und Nationale Identität, L'Âge d'Homme, 1993, p. 197, {{ISBN|2-8251-0412-4}}, {{ISBN|978-2-8251-0412-5}}&lt;/ref&gt; He is one proponent of "Egyptian yoga", a branch of yoga based on the observation of the ancient-Egyptian art.

== Biography ==
Khane was born in [[Dakar]], into a Sufi family. He learned yoga at an early age and became a disciple of [[Paramahansa Yogananda]]. He founded the first center of the International Yoga Institute (or Institut International de Yoga) in Dakar, in 1960. In 1964, he was invited by Philippe Baumgartner, a French gerontologist and author of several books (among them, ''L'Homme et son Âge'', Julliard, Paris, 1959; and ''101 Conseils pour retrouver et développer la mémoire'', Hachette, Paris, 1976, {{ISBN|2-01-002324-2}}) to take part with him in several international medical conferences in order to explain and show how yoga might be helpful against the ageing process. In 1965, Baumgartner asked him to collaborate with him in the treatment of his rheumatic patients in [[Aix-les-Bains]]. Both organised later an annual course of treatment in [[Gorée]]. This collaboration lasted until the death of Baumgartner in 1980 and was very important for the genesis of the therapeutic and preventive yoga method created by Khane. Baumgartner introduced Khane in several important European yoga schools and federations who invited him soon to give often seminars and hatha-yoga demonstrations. In 1972, he opened his first yoga teacher training school in Switzerland.&lt;ref&gt;About Khane's biography and the beginning of his yoga teaching in Switzerland, see Jean-François Mayer, ''op. cit.'', p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; In 1974, he became a member of the pedagogic committee of the Fédération Française de Yoga (called now the FNEY). In 1978, he decided to leave this Federation and devote himself entirely to the development of the International Yoga Institute in Europe, Africa and America. His yoga school now has branches in many countries throughout the world.

==Khane's teaching method==
When he began to introduce yoga in the treatment of Baumgartner's old and rheumatic patients, Khane had to adapt his teaching to the limited abilities of this new audience. For pedagogic reasons, he decided to introduce into his hatha-yoga lessons some Chinese exercises based on the inner style (Nei Shia) of the kung-fu method&lt;ref&gt;This method is different from the martial kung-fu and has some spiritual effects : about this question, see Jean-François Meyer, ''op. cit.'', p. 197&lt;/ref&gt; attributed to the Indian Buddhist monk Bodhidharma. He used in addition some postures depicted in the temples of ancient Egypt, which he calls "Egyptian yoga".

== Khane and Egyptian Yoga ==

&lt;/gallery&gt;

Khane wrote several books about "[[Egyptian yoga]]". He claimed in those books that some hatha-yoga [[asanas]] were practised in ancient [[Egypt]]. Khane claims in addition that other poses represented in Egyptian temples and graves had similar effects to the Indian one and could be considered as yoga postures. As Khane mentions himself,&lt;ref&gt;''Le Yoga des Pharaons'', p. 9&lt;/ref&gt; some "Egyptian" postures had been taught in the past by Hanish (Mazdanan, 1932), and A. de Sambucy, who wrote in the sixties the book ''Le Yoga irano-égyptien''. Khane built a complete pedagogic system based on the Egyptian bas-reliefs and paintings, and studied the similarities between some Egyptian words or pharaonic symbols and Indian yogic concepts. He proposes to see in Pharao a model of the human realization.&lt;ref&gt;see M. Adam, op. cit.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;The assertion made by Khane in many of his books, lectures, interviews and articles is that signs of the existence of yoga appear at approximately  the same time in India and Egypt, and that the two traditions are very close, but parallel. For Khane, yoga is a universal legacy kept in life and passed down to humanity through generations by India, despite the fact that it is possible to find numerous traces of yoga in Ancient Egypt and perhaps in a few Judaeo-Christian or Islamic practices.&lt;ref&gt;Numerous academic authors coming from very varied backgrounds, in particular Pr Cheikh Anta Diop and the French egyptologist [[Christiane Desroches Noblecourt]] (see ''Le fabuleux héritage de l'Égypte'', and Pr. [[Christian Cannuyer]] whose thesis theme was the Egyptian origin of the Christian heartprayer, wrote about Egypt's contribution to others religions. About Khane's position in this subject, see in particular ''Le Yoga des Pharaons'', p. 213-220 (chapter entitled "Moïse et l'héritage égyptien" or p. 39-42, where he compares Christ's and christian priest's attitude to an ancient Egyptian one.&lt;/ref&gt; For him what is important in the fact that yoga was practiced in Egypt, is that it is a link between several spiritual traditions and a factor of unity for humanity.&lt;ref&gt;see ''Le Yoga des Pharaons'', p. 9-11, where he evokes the teaching by Yogananda and his master, Srî Yukteswar, about the unity of the spiritual message and suggests  Ancient Egypt as a possible historical basis to this unity.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
The idea that yoga was practised in Ancient Egypt is now accepted by several European writers specialized in the study of the spirituality.&lt;ref&gt;see Marc-Alain Descamps : II a même existé un " yoga irano-égyptien " qui a ete enseigné dès 1932 par le Dr. Hanish d'après les Mazdanans, puis vers 1960 par le Dr. De Sambucy et enfin par Babacar Khane de Dakar [http://www.yoganet.fr/MBlog/index.php?blog=1&amp;Date=2008-04-18]. See in addition some lectures made  by the psychiatrist and writer Jacques Vigne.&lt;/ref&gt; Khane is generally accepted by other yoga schools as one of the main exponents of Egyptian yoga. Davina Delor writes : "Babacar Khane est le maître contemporain révélateur du Yoga des Pharaons."&lt;ref&gt;Davina, ''Maxi Yoga'', Marabout, Paris, 2003, {{ISBN|2-501-03899-1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[Gérard Blitz (entrepreneur)|Gérard Blitz]], former General Secretary of the European Union of National Yoga Federations (UEFNY, called now European Union of Yoga) credits him with having found the traces of the Egyptian yoga "Es este hombre que se interesa al Yoga Egipcio, Yoga de el que él su esposa han vuelto a encontrar huellas en una civilización antigua de al menos seis mil anos (ver su libro : "El Yoga de los Faraones"&lt;ref&gt;Preface to ''El Yoga de la Plegaria'', translation by Margot Paccaud, p. 4)&lt;/ref&gt; and asked him to conduct several international yogic trips (1987, 1989, 1991) to Egypt under the patronage of the European Union of National Yoga Federations.&lt;br /&gt;
In Africa, [[Senghor]] in one of his official speeches,&lt;ref&gt;Journées de la Jeunesse, 1980 (?).&lt;/ref&gt; called upon Senegalese youth and athletes to return beyond Greece to their Egyptian roots, following the path opened by Khane.

== International recognition ==
An "internationally recognized" master,&lt;ref&gt;"Babacar, maestro reconocido internationalmente", editorial staff of Yoga Journal España, N° 21, 2008, p. 92.&lt;/ref&gt; Khane has been selected as member of the World Yoga Council. The Institut International de Yoga is a member of the International Yoga Federation and the European Yoga Alliance. Khane is regularly invited to perform yoga and give lectures or yoga lessons in international Yoga conferences throughout the world. Since 1973, he has participated many times in the annual conference organized in Zinal by the European Union of Yoga.&lt;ref&gt;See a photo entitled "Zinal (Suisse) : démonstration par le yogi Babacar Khane", in "Le yogi et le médecin", magazine ''L'Express'', 30 sept. – 6 oct. 1974, p. 55&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
[[Gérard Blitz (entrepreneur)|Gérard Blitz]], important person in the field of yoga, wrote about him : "hombre cuya sola presencia es sugestiva, un Sabio auténtico."&lt;ref&gt;Gérard Blitz, Prefacio de ''El Yoga de la Plegaria''., p. 3.&lt;/ref&gt; &lt;br /&gt;From 1978 to 1988, his yoga lessons were broadcast daily on [[Radio Télévision Sénégalaise]] (RTS). Several European TV channels (for example La Deuxième Chaîne, called now France 2, 1972) invited him to take part in programmes about yoga or interviewed him (Algerian TV channel, Spanish and Greek TV channels).&lt;br /&gt; On the request of an Algerian Minister, Abdelmadjid Aouchiche, Director of DNC and former Dr Baumgartner's patient, Khane was asked by the Algerian state (though communist at this time) to introduce yoga in Algeria while training a team of yoga teachers, from 1978 to 1982.&lt;ref&gt;See the web page of one of these teachers [http://www.yuga-dz.c.la]/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;br /&gt;
Khane's work and finds in the domain of Egyptian yoga are presented as reference in several academic publications.&lt;ref&gt;See M. Adam, ''Revue Philosophique de la France et de l'Etranger'', PUF, Paris, 1984, p. 256. Lilyan Kesteloot, ''Dieux d'eau du Sahel, Voyage à travers les mythes de Seth à Tyamaba'', L'Harmattan/IFAN, Paris, 2007, {{ISBN|978-2-296-04384-8}}, p. 75. Faculté Catholique de Kinshasa, ''La responsabilité politique du philosophe africain: actes du IXème Séminaire scientifique de philosophie'', du 20 au 23 juin 1993, p. 133-134. See in addition Paul L. Hamilton, ''African People's contributions to world civilizations : Shattering the Myths'', R.A. Renaissance Publications, 1995, p. 129.&lt;/ref&gt;
Several books and articles by other European yoga teachers are based expressly on Khane's teaching.&lt;ref&gt;See in particular Dieter Gratza, ''Ägyptisches Yoga'', Karl F. Haug Fachbuchverlag, 2001, {{ISBN|978-3-8304-0822-2}}, Margot Paccaud, ''Transformacion por el yoga, yoga egipcio'', Mandala ediciones, Madrid, {{ISBN|978-84-88769-50-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Khane's poetic work ==

Khane is considered by Marie-Madeleine Davy, a specialist of the French medieval mystical theology,&lt;ref&gt;She is author of ''Encyclopédie des mystiques'' and many other books. She was Docteur ès Lettres, Professor at the University of Manchester and Master of Researches (CNRS)&lt;/ref&gt;'' as "hijo digno de los poetas soufis".&lt;ref&gt;Marie-Madeleine Davy, prefacio de ''Yoga por la palabra.

'''British Traditional Wicca''' (abbreviated '''BTW''') is the term used to group a set of [[Wicca]]n traditions originating in the [[New Forest|New Forest region]] of England. The term British Traditional Wicca is used to define the originator traditions and practices (usually with traceable [[lineage (anthropology)|lineage]]) apart from other subsequent forms of Wicca.

The most prominent of these traditions are [[Gardnerian Wicca]] and [[Alexandrian Wicca]] but also other traditions claiming a shared [[New Forest coven|New Forest history]]. These reach as far abroad as America with traditions such as [[Central Valley Wicca]]. 

==History of the term Wicca==

The term "wicca" is well-attested as the [[Old English language|Old English]] word for "[male] witch", the female form being "wicce" both older forms of the Modern English "witch".&lt;ref&gt;[[Wiktionary:Witch]]&lt;/ref&gt; In modern usage, however, it came into the public lexicon with the works of [[Gerald Gardner (Wiccan)|Gerald Gardner]], with the spelling "wica".&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Gardner, ''Witchcraft Today'', {{ISBN|0-8065-2593-2}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Gerald Gardner, ''The Meaning of Witchcraft'', {{ISBN|1-57863-309-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="53693">The '''Cadet Org''' was a former subdivision of the [[Church of Scientology]] for the children of members of the [[Sea Org]] (SO), an internal Scientology grouping of the organization's most dedicated members. It operated for about thirty years between the early 1970s and the early 2000s in a number of locations in the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia. Some of its facilities reportedly housed as many as 400 children who were aged between a few months and sixteen years old.

Children in the Cadet Org were divided into two or three different categories reflecting their age and level of proficiency in Scientology. They were typically housed in dorms under the supervision of a small number of adults. Conditions at Cadet Org facilities were reportedly often dirty and unsafe, which resulted in at least two prosecutions by public authorities. The children were granted only infrequent contact with their parents and reportedly had very little time off or playtime.

The Cadet Org was said to have been severely under-resourced, leading to a lack of basic provisions such as toilet paper, food and clothing at various times and places. The Church of Scientology itself reported that the Cadet Org was often treated as a dumping ground for adult staff who had failed elsewhere in the Sea Org, leading to unsuitable people, including pedophiles, working in Cadet Org facilities. Internal church documents and the accounts of ex-members have highlighted recurrent problems with physical and sexual abuse of children in the Cadet Org.

Like the adult Sea Org, the Cadet Org was run on quasi-military lines with a strict daily routine, timed to the minute, that ran from at least 6.30 am to 9.30 pm. Children were given posts and were assigned responsibility for managing various aspects of their facilities, including discipline. They were required to do hard physical labor, sometimes without protective equipment and at very young ages.

The Cadet Org was eventually dissolved around the start of the 21st century after Sea Org members were forbidden to have children, as they were regarded as too great a burden. This reportedly resulted in many female Sea Org members having abortions to avoid being punished by the Church for contravening the ban.

==Origins and policies==

The Cadet Org was defined by Scientology's founder [[L. Ron Hubbard]] as being

{{quote|manned by children who have actual posts ... Unless they are signed up SO members, the children are used in the galley or estates EPF [Estates Project Force] only. There must be a nursery. There must be QMs [Quartermasters] on duty as reception. There must be stable personnel – and there only could be if this were to have the status of an org. You want quarters where you can have a baby care unit, dormitories, kitchens and moderate space for the Cadet Org desks, auditing and Qual[ifications] functions. Why should they be miserable and knocked about when they can have their own org and be respected and demand respect from their elders as well, and feel proud of themselves.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Hubbard|first=L. Ron|title=Modern Management Technology Defined|publisher=Church of Scientology of California Publications Organization United States|location=Los Angeles|edition=1976|page=62}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Hubbard's attitude towards children was to treat them as what he termed "assets". In 1972 he wrote:

{{quote|In the American society exists a degraded contempt for children. Adults regard them as "dear little cute things God damn them."

This attitude is not allowed in the Sea Org.

THE YOUNG PEOPLE OF A SOCIETY ARE AN ASSET AND MUST BE CARED FOR AND PROPERLY BROUGHT UP AS VALUABLE BEINGS. THOSE WHO DECIDE TO JOIN THE SEA ORG AND BE PART OF THE TEAM MUST BE ALLOWED TO DO THEIR BEST.&lt;ref name="FO3167"&gt;Hubbard, "The Organization of Children in Land-Based Units". Flag Order 3167, 6 April 1972&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He told Scientologists in 1973:

{{quote|It is not practical at this time to try to run a self-supportive school. Under heading of resources, then, any grandiose scheme would fail. The why of finances is that we are doing the only effective work in the field yet psychiatrists and psychologists who have no result are dragging in all the billions. We must therefore reserve our resources in order to apply them to shorter term expansion, defense, and, of course, taking over eventually the field and its appropriations. Reversely those children will have a role to play in this and are resources. The Industrial age looks on a child as a non-resource and so will anyone in the SO that is steeped in the culture from which they came. They are sentimentally destructive and think it is too cold blooded to look on children as a resource.&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, L. Ron. "Despatch to LRH Comm US". 15 September 73&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In Scientology doctrine, children are regarded as being "adults in small bodies". According to L. Ron Hubbard, their bodies house ancient and immortal [[thetan]]s or spirits who are capable of carrying out the same responsibilities as any adult. Because their spirits are regarded as ageless, their status as children is irrelevant.&lt;ref name="Hill63"&gt;{{cite book|title=Beyond Belief|last=Miscavige Hill|first=Jenna|publisher=William Morrow|location=New York, NY|page=63|isbn=978-0-06-224848-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Scientologists working as staff members believe that their most important purpose is saving the world and everything else is secondary. Vicki Aznaran, a former church official, explains: "Scientology comes first, and everything else is off-purpose. Parents who want to spend time with their children are looked down on. It's not socially acceptable."&lt;ref name="Kreuger" /&gt;

During the late 1960s, when Hubbard founded the Sea Org to accompany him aboard the ships ''Apollo'', ''Athena'', ''Diana'', and ''Excalibur'', caring for children presented a significant problem for Sea Org members. A post of "Governess" was established in 1968 to look after Sea Org children. The difficulty of looking after children aboard a ship is hinted at by Hubbard's instruction that if a child was "found in Hold 1 or any hidden compartment of the ship they are to be locked up."&lt;ref&gt;Hubbard, "Governess". Flag Order 1630, 3 December 1968&lt;/ref&gt;

By the early 1970s, Sea Org members were being based ashore and new arrangements were needed. In 1972, the newly-established Cadet Org was divided into three subgroups: Cadets, who were Sea Org members on the payroll with posts of their own; children, aged 6 and above, who were not on the payroll, and babies or small children, who were under 6 years of age. Children and Cadets were permitted to attend public or state schools in their area, but had to undertake Scientology study in the evenings to "handle any confusions" caused by what they had covered in school. Sea Org parents were allowed to form Parents' Committees to oversea the living conditions and upbringing of Sea Org children.&lt;ref name="FO3167" /&gt; However, parents' contact with their children was restricted; communications "to a child or about a child" were required to go through the Cadets' Commanding Officer "who may alter or cut it if off [program]."&lt;ref name="Crivello"&gt;Crivello, Steve, "Re – Cadet Org". CMO ED 411, 29 August 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

Children who transgressed were to be punished "by placing that child in the [Rehabilitation Project Force] under severe restrictions".&lt;ref name="Crivello" /&gt; The RPF is a program for Sea Org members who are regarded as having violated expectations or policies, and has been characterized by critics as a forced labor and re-indoctrination program. A version for children was established by order of L. Ron Hubbard. It appears to have fallen into abeyance for a while, but a 1989 minute by a Cadet Org staff member recommended its reinstitution. The author wrote that she had "several Cadets and blown [escaped] Cadets who need to go to the children's RPF ... A very small percentage are enturbulative [troublesome] sources and are sabotaging efforts to set the scene right. They need to be moved off the line per Forcing In The Ideal Scene." One particular child, who was named in the document, was recommended to be "moved off everyone's lines and put into the Children's RPF. [He] recently took a razor blade and cut X's in his skin up and down both his arms. He is pychotic [sic] in PT [present time] and needs close supervision."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Brainwashing in Scientology’s Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF)|url=http://www.hamburg.de/contentblob/109286/data/brainwashing.pdf|publisher=Interior Ministry Behörde für Inneres – Arbeitsgruppe Scientology und Landeszentrale für politische Bildung, Hamburg|page=42|format=PDF|date=October 2000|accessdate=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Life in the Cadet Org==
===California===
====Los Angeles====
Sea Org children based in Los Angeles, California, lived in a number of facilities including a building on Fountain Avenue, another on Melrose Avenue and two three-story buildings at 811 Beacon Street. One of them, Tonja Burden, spent three months at Beacon Street in 1973 at the age of 13. She later testified that at the facility, which housed 400 children,

{{quote|[m]y duties were to care, clean and feed the children.  Myself and another girl my age were the two oldest children at the Cadet Organization. The living conditions were squalid. Glass from broken windows lay strewn over the floors. Live electrical wires were exposed in areas where young children played. We received little food. On several occasions spoiled milk with maggots was served to children. The maggots were removed by hand before the milk was served. In addition to caring for the children, I cleaned toilets daily. I wrote to L. Ron Hubbard explaining the conditions, but nothing improved. Children were not allowed to live with their parents. Scientology permitted one visit every other week, and only for 45 minutes during mealtime.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Affidavit of Tonja Burden|date=25 January 1980}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

By the Church's own admission, the Fountain Avenue facility was illegal, as it flouted local child safety regulations. It violated several building codes – it was not the right type of construction for group care of children, children under five were cared for above the first floor, and the children's rooms did not all have exits directly to the outside of the building. The illegalities were discovered by the Los Angeles County and State authorities following a hepatitis outbreak in February 1979. The church was tipped off that it would be raided by California state agents. This gave it time to move the children into an annex building that was hurriedly made to confirm with legal requirements. By the time the raid took place, a church official reported, "there was nothing they could do to us."&lt;ref name="Lamarr"&gt;Lamarr, Stephen. "Parent Briefing on Annex and PT Scene". Cadet GO ED #4, 5 May 1979&lt;/ref&gt;

One of the nannies, Sheila Huber, said that at the age of sixteen she was put in charge of around thirty children aged under three, all housed in a single one-bedroom apartment: "I couldn't believe it. It was wall-to-wall cribs. There were just under 30 children and they were under my sole care. I had no training."&lt;ref name="Cannane" /&gt; Perhaps not surprisingly, the children had very restricted lives, according to Huber. She later recalled:

{{quote|They never got outside. Actually, they got out once – in eight months, they got out once. And that ... took three months to get that approved. ... We took them in a van, the children, and took them to the park and they spent so much time in their cribs, day after day, night after night, that they wouldn't go in any space larger than the size of their cribs. They were terrified. They were terrified of sunlight.&lt;ref name="Cannane" /&gt;}}

====PAC Ranch====
Some of the children of Scientologists working at the Church's Pacific Area Command (PAC) base in Los Angeles were housed at Canyon Oaks Ranch near [[Santa Clarita, California]], north-west of the city.  According to former Scientologists Saina Kamula and Mirriam Francis, who lived at the PAC Ranch in the mid-1990s, it was a "military-esque" facility that operated "like [[Lord of the Flies]]".&lt;ref name="Bentley" /&gt; Francis described it as "a bunch of trailers plopped down on a few acres in desert SoCal area and that's where we studied more Scientology and worked and lived amongst each other."&lt;ref name="Nededog" /&gt; Kamula and Francis say that children were punished by being made to eat lunch behind maggot-infested dumpsters. Similar to other Cadet Org facilities, the children living at the PAC Ranch were made to carry out hard physical labor including demolish possibly asbestos-laced walls 
or laying bricks on [[L. Ron Hubbard Way]] in Los Angeles. Kamula says that she was made to work for 60 hours a week as an underage teen and suffered severe stress as a result, which led to her being placed on a suicide watch on several occasions. The facility was shut down in 2007.&lt;ref name="Bentley" /&gt;

====Int Ranch====
In the 1990s, the children of Sea Org members working at Scientology's [[Gold Base]] in California were housed in a facility called the "Int[ernational] Ranch". This was located on five hundred acres of land in the San Jacinto Hills in [[Riverside County]], adjacent to the [[Soboba Indian Reservation]] about 20 miles from Gold Base. A cluster of buildings called the Motels occupied the center of the site, with six or seven other buildings scattered around nearby.&lt;ref name="Hill34"&gt;Miscavige Hill, p. 34&lt;/ref&gt; When [[Jenna Miscavige Hill]] was sent there at the age of six in March 1990, she was one of fifteen other children of senior Scientology executives who lived at the site – a figure that eventually grew to around 80.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', pp. 1, 41&lt;/ref&gt;

The site was dilapidated, overgrown and presented fire risks, so the children were put to work renovating it. Although electrical and plumbing work was carried out by adults, virtually all of the other renovation work was carried out by the children.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 41&lt;/ref&gt; The children were divided into three groups: Children, Precadets and Cadets. The grouping was determined by both age and how advanced they were in their Scientology training. The youngest, the Children, were generally under six years old, Precadets were seven to nine and Cadets nine to sixteen. It was possible for particularly advanced younger children to be Cadets, or for older children who were behind with their studies to still be Precadets. It was also possible for children to be demoted to a lower group as a punishment.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 48&lt;/ref&gt;

Later in 1990 an increasingly regimented regime was put in place in which the children's activities were scheduled down to the minute. It became more like a military boot camp in which children were made to do what Miscavige Hill describes as "gruelling drills, endless musters, exhaustive inspections, and arduous physical labor that no child should have to do."&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 49&lt;/ref&gt; A rigorous system of punishments and internal surveillance was implemented to keep the children in line. Any infractions resulted in being issued a chit, a kind of written demerit, which was kept on record. The children were instructed to report on each other's activities and speak up if they saw any infractions, otherwise they would be considered an accessory to the offense and would receive the same punishment as the offender. This, Miscavige Hill says, "made it difficult for anyone to trust anyone else".&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', pp. 49–50&lt;/ref&gt;

Life for a Cadet or Precadet followed a set, and lengthy, daily routine, overseen by the children themselves in accordance with L. Ron Hubbard's instructions. They wore uniforms consisting of khaki shorts with a red t-shirt or polo shirt with the Sea Org emblem embroidered on it. They also had sweat pants, dress pants and a vest but were not permitted to wear any of their own clothes, with the exception of pajamas.&lt;ref name="Woodcraft" /&gt;

They were roused at 6.30 am and given half an hour to carry out cleaning assignments. At 7 am they were formed up into seven different Divisions, each under a Division Head, for a morning muster in front of the Commanding Officer Cadet – a fellow Cadet. The children stood to attention with the Division Heads saluting while the Master-at-Arms, another child, read out a military-style report on each Division's status. Uniforms were inspected and the personal hygiene of each child was checked, with their breath and armpits smell-tested and their hair inspected for lice.&lt;ref name="Hill52-53"&gt;''Ibid.'', pp. 52–53&lt;/ref&gt;

Punishments were imposed for lateness or failing inspections. Lateness was particularly harshly punished, ranging from being issued with a chit to having a bucket of ice water poured over the offender's head. Failing a berthing inspection would result at the very least in receiving a chit. An offender might alternatively be ordered to white-glove the room (cleaning it so well that a person wearing white gloves could run their hands over the surfaces without getting them dirty) or in extremis being ordered to sleep overnight in Pig's Berthing, an old mattress in a rat- and bat-infested derelict building on the site.&lt;ref name="Hill52-53" /&gt; Zoe Woodcraft, who was there at the same time as Miscavige Hill, wrote that she recalled "two girls about nine years old who were forced to spend the night there and in the middle of the night they ran screaming and crying from the building.  One of the girls afterward told me that they had been terrified by the bats and couldn't stand it anymore."&lt;ref name="Woodcraft" /&gt;

After the morning muster, a period of Scientology training was followed by work on the children's assigned posts. Miscavige Hill was made a groundsman at the age of six, responsible for the upkeep and maintenance of part of the grounds, which involved physical labor. A few months later, when she was seven, she was made the Medical Liaison Officer – in effect the site doctor – with responsibility for identifying and treating any medical conditions reported by the children. She was also responsible for doling out vitamins and formulas as specified by Hubbard, which every child was required to ingest daily.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', pp. 54–55&lt;/ref&gt; No matter how sick a child was, no drugs were allowed other than antibiotics, but visits from real doctors were rare. In the entire time that Miscavige Hill was at the Int Ranch, she did not go to a doctor once despite several periods of sickness.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', pp. 56–57&lt;/ref&gt;

Breakfast took place between 8.30 and 9 am. A "table captain" was assigned for each table to supervise the delivery of food.&lt;ref name="Woodcraft"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.xenu-directory.net/mirrors/www.whyaretheydead.net/childabuse/woodcraft/Zoe-dec-010124.html|title=Declaration of Zoe Woodcraft|last=Woodcraft|first=Zoe|date=24 January 2001|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; This followed by fifteen minutes for the children to clean the dishes and dining room, and then a second muster. Between 9.15 am and 12.45 pm, Monday through Friday, and all day Saturday, the children went to decks or labor-intensive projects. Deck time formally lasted 25 hours per week but work more realistically lasted for at least 35 hours per week for all the Precadets and Cadets, from ages six upwards. They were divided into labor units which were assigned to specific projects, many involving hard physical labor. There was some lighter work such as doing the laundry or cleaning the swimming pool, but the children were also responsible for rock hauling, weeding, planting trees, digging irrigation trenches, landscaping the site and renovating buildings. On Saturdays the children had to carry out intensive cleaning of their berthings and the buildings. The adults at the Int Ranch issued project orders and inspected the results to make sure they were satisfactory, but only rarely intervened to help out the children. The work took place in all weathers, ranging from rain and hail to temperatures upwards of 100&amp;nbsp;°F (30&amp;nbsp;°C), with only occasional five-minute breaks permitted. There was no protective equipment and the children often had to wear inappropriate clothing, such as shorts in the winter, as there was no funding for new clothes.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', pp. 58–60&lt;/ref&gt;

Scientology put forward a number of justifications for making the children do such work. They were told that the labor was an exchange for being able to live on the Ranch, earning their way rather than getting things for free, which was something that only criminals sought. The hard labor was said to be a way to train the children to take pride in their work, face tough situations and handle MEST (the physical world), which would make them better Scientologists. If their work or conduct was repeatedly deemed unsatisfactory they would be sent to the HMU, the Heavy MEST Work Unit, where they would be required to do the hardest forms of physical labor such as deep trench digging. Offenders were also physically isolated from the rest of the children.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', pp. 60–61&lt;/ref&gt;

Miscavige Hill notes that "we were a group of children who devoted hours of every day to doing the kind of physical labor that no child should have to do." The work was physically taxing:

{{quote|We got callouses and blisters. We had cuts and bruises. Our hands lost feeling when we plunged them into the frigid water of the creek bed for rocks. When we pulled weeds from the scorched summer earth, our hands burned from the friction and stung from the nettle. The conditions we worked under would have been tough for a grown man, and yet any complaints, backflashing [talking back], any kind of questioning was instantly met with disciplinary action.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 63&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Deck time ended at 12.45 pm and was followed by clean-up and lunch. An hour later at 1.45 pm, schooling began in a range of typical academic topics, which the children taught themselves using textbooks and checksheets.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 65&lt;/ref&gt; There was no teacher but the children were instead overseen by a course supervisor who tested them on an [[E-meter]] to see if they had misunderstood anything. This continued until 6 pm, with a fifteen-minute break and a snack. Dinner and another clean-up took place from 6 to 6.45 pm, followed by Scientology training until 9 pm.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 68&lt;/ref&gt;

Finally, the children were required to fill out Student Point Slips, a kind of progress report for the day, in which various activities were assigned point scores for completion. This was used for the "management by statistics" system implemented by Hubbard across Scientology: the points were tabulated and marked on a graph, which had to show an up-trend each day. Each day ended with an adulation period for L. Ron Hubbard, whose portrait was displayed on the wall of the course room. The children would face his picture, chant "Hip! Hip! Hooray", and applaud the portrait for a couple of minutes. After a short period to get ready for bed, lights-out came at 9.30 pm sharp, ending a thirteen-hour day.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', pp. 71–72&lt;/ref&gt;

The children had no free or play time,&lt;ref name="Woodcraft" /&gt; but there were three breaks to the routine during the week. On Thursday afternoons, the children were required to spend two hours tallying up their daily statistics to determine their status in accordance with the concept of [[Ethics (Scientology)|Scientology ethics]]. Depending on the outcome of the graphing, the children would have to take particular steps to improve or maintain their statistics. If the trend was down, potentially negative consequences would follow, such as having privileges revoked or being given only rice and beans to eat. The children were also given weekly E-meter checks to determine whether they were concealing secrets or transgressions, and had to write weekly reports to their parents. On Friday evenings a graduation ceremony was held for course completions and Scientology media presentations were shown, followed by the disbursement of a five-dollar weekly allowance.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', pp. 73–77&lt;/ref&gt;

Contact with parents was extremely limited. Jenna Miscavige Hill's father visited once a week for twenty minutes during his lunch break, and was unusual for being one of only a few parents to do so.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', pp. 45–46&lt;/ref&gt; At 10 pm on Saturday nights, she was allowed to go to her parents' apartment to stay with them overnight.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 78&lt;/ref&gt; She was also given two or three days off over Christmas.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 97&lt;/ref&gt; Letters to and from parents were monitored to ensure that nothing negative was said. Any complaints would be treated as "nattering" and punished.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 76&lt;/ref&gt; Weekly phone calls were also permitted.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 79&lt;/ref&gt; The children were occasionally let out to attend special events, when Miscavige Hill says they were "dressed up in cute outfits in front of our parents and Int crew to make it seem as though Scientology were creating a normal and joyful childhood, when in fact we were all being robbed of it."&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 80&lt;/ref&gt; Zoe Woodcraft, by contrast, spent over a year there but, she says, 
"we never went into town for a field trip; never went to a movie, shopping or anything.  We were totally isolated.  The only time I ever left was when I was allowed once to take a leave of absence to visit my father at Christmas."&lt;ref name="Woodcraft" /&gt;

In the absence of parental support, Miscavige Hill writes,

{{quote|[W]e practically were each other's parents, taking care of each other when we were sick, consoling each other when we couldn't sleep, disciplining each other when we acted out, feeding each other meals when we were hungry and helping each other with schoolwork when we were confused. Yes, we were responsible for our post work, deck work, academic work, Scientology course work and cleaning – but, more than anything else, we were responsible for each other.&lt;ref&gt;''Ibid.'', p. 81&lt;/ref&gt;}}

====Apollo Training Academy====
Some children were sent to the Apollo Training Academy (ATA), located on Fountain Street opposite the offices of Scientology publishing house [[Bridge Publications (Scientology)|Bridge Publications]]. Mike Rinder, a former high-ranking Scientology official, describes it as "a cinder block building, with a double-wide trailer in the front, six-foot fence around it with a top on it so outside people couldn't see".&lt;ref name="Nededog"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://uk.businessinsider.com/leah-remini-scientology-aftermath-season-2-premiere-recap-child-abuse-2017-8/|title=The most shocking allegations of what it's like for children in Scientology, according to Leah Remini's show|last=Nededog|first=Jethro|publisher=Business Insider|date=August 16, 2017|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; It was originally run by a Scientology entity called the Cadets Estate Organization, which was later separated from the Cadet Org. Woodcraft was sent there after returning from a stay in New York in 1992, when she was nine years old, as there was no more room for children at the ranch. She later wrote that the conditions there were the worst that she ever encountered as a child:

{{quote|[T]he pool was covered over with plywood and we were instructed not to walk on it, as it was flimsy and unsafe. Children played on it anyway as we were often unsupervised. The carpets were old and smelly and there were a lot of cockroaches. We slept in metal bunk beds with chipping paint. There was no proper bedding; not one of us had a complete sheet set, blanket and pillow. I slept without a pillow for many months.

All of the furniture was very old and decrepit.  For light, we had bare bulbs hanging from the ceiling.  The kitchens had also been ripped out to make more room for people so there were exposed pipes everywhere ... This building was in an unsafe area of Los Angeles and I often heard gunshots at night. It was a very frightening place for me to live.

The bathrooms .... were also not fully functional and we often had no warm water, the tiles in the shower were moldy and we had no soap or towels. In addition, the elevators in this four-story building never worked so we always had to use the steps.&lt;ref name="Woodcraft" /&gt;}}

The ATA operated as a Scientology school for about two hundred children. They studied a mixed Scientology and mainstream curriculum comprising L. Ron Hubbard's works plus math, reading and spelling. Unlike the ranch, there was no strict regimentation and the children were able to go to the beach or the park on Mondays. According to Woodcraft, they "would often go to a park and spend the whole day there, also.  They would also take us to a fifty-cent swimming pool, however a lot of the kids did not have the money to swim so we just sat around all day.  If we asked the teacher for money, she said no and told us it was too bad for us we had no money."&lt;ref name="Woodcraft" /&gt;

Although the location did not allow for the kind of hard outdoor labor performed at the ranch, the children were nonetheless put to work cleaning the building. Woodcraft recalled being assigned to an activity they called "chicken picking" the carpet. She wrote:

{{quote|Since we had no vacuum cleaner, we children were instructed to get down on our hands and knees and pick dirt out of the carpet.  This dirt included paint chips and we were expected to leave our section in perfect condition.  This was very hard to do, especially in the small space between the carpet and the wall.  There would be all sorts of small trash in there including paint and staples that hurt my fingers.&lt;ref name="Woodcraft" /&gt;}}

There were also problems with the staff at the ATA. Saina Kamula, a former member of the Sea Org, has said that an older member of staff at the ATA repeatedly sexually abused her during her stay there in the 1990s. When she reported the abuse to a teacher, she says, she was punished for being "counter-intention" – acting against the interests of Scientology. The abuser was never punished and remained an "active and respected member of the Church" as of August 2017.&lt;ref name="Bentley"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.hollywoodreporter.com/live-feed/leah-remini-scientology-aftermath-season-2-premiere-recap-1030020|title='Leah Remini: Scientology and the Aftermath' Details Child Abuse Allegations in Season 2 Premiere|last=Bentley|first=Jean|date=August 15, 2017|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Florida===

During the 1990s a Cadet Org facility operated near Scientology's "Mecca", the city of [[Clearwater, Florida]]. It was situated in a former Quality Inn, which the Scientologists called the QI, at 16432 U.S. Highway 19 in [[Largo, Florida]]. Woodcraft's entire family of five was initially housed there in 1986 in a single room which was "very small, approximately 12' by 20'.  It was one room and one bath; very shabby, infested with cockroaches and smelling of mold.  All five of us were in this room so it was very cramped and nearly unlivable." She returned to the QI for a while in 1993 and then for a longer stay from 1994 to 2000, living in a Cadet Org dorm in the building.&lt;ref name="Woodcraft" /&gt; When 12-year-old Scientology cadet Kristi Erlich flew from Los Angeles to visit her 13-year-old sister Beth at the QI, her first reaction to the sight of her room was one of horror: "Oh my god, I couldn't even believe that Beth lived in a place like that. There were bugs everywhere.... We were always scared of having bugs run across our feet and face and stuff while we were sleeping."&lt;ref name="Kreuger"&gt;{{cite news|title=Scientology's Children|last=Krueger|first=Curtis|work=St. Petersburg Times|date=November 10–11, 1991}}&lt;/ref&gt;

After escaping from Scientology at the end of 2000, Woodcraft wrote a detailed account of life at the QI. She described it as "overall depressing and dreary", and the Cadets and Precadets were kept "always on a boring and strict schedule." The Precadets were never allowed to leave the premises, rarely went on outings and could only play in the parking lot. Woodcraft worked every afternoon and all day on Sundays, which was designated as "renos" (renovations) day where the children worked to repair and refurbish the building. Saturday afternoons could also be designated as "renos", after parental visits earlier in the day. On one "reno" assignment, she was told to demolish the walls of a room in the QI:

{{quote|This was a strange room that had plywood attached in two layers on all the walls. We were ripping the plywood off the walls. When I asked the cadet coordinator what this room was he told me it was for "ethics particles" who had become upset or hysterical. He would place them (children) in this room and lock them in. Some of them had become so upset that they were kicking holes in the original walls as they were only drywall, so he had layered the walls with plywood so no one could kick through.&lt;ref name="Woodcraft" /&gt;}}

On Saturday nights the children could watch a movie, selected by the building's governess. Woodcraft recalled that for a while, the governess "was in love with a move called "White Knight" and we had to watch that movie over and over again for weeks.  This was not a children's movie and it was unbelievably boring."&lt;ref name="Woodcraft" /&gt;

Strict censorship was applied to the children's listening and reading materials. Woodcraft wrote:

{{quote|Our rooms were searched for offensive materials and if something not approved was found it was confiscated. For example an Alanis Morrisette tape was taken away because she was "downtone" and "too much in anger." ''Archie'' Magazines were considered "too sexually oriented" and these were forbidden.  ''Seventeen'' Magazine was also not allowed, nor were any fashion magazines because of the "middle class orientation" and sexual content.&lt;ref name="Woodcraft" /&gt;}}

Woodcraft rose through the ranks and took on various jobs, "one of which was to make sure all the
pictures of Ron Hubbard looked nice, so I was always cleaning cockroach feces out of the frames and the cardboard backing." In another post, as the Hubbard Communications Office Area Secretary (HAS) and Director of Inspections and Reports, she managed disciplinary affairs: "I had to read the
"overt write ups" of the other cadets.  This would include the reports written up about masturbation and other sexual activity between the cadets.  I also participated in courts of ethics and committees of evidence for children. These are disciplinary actions per church policies."&lt;ref name="Woodcraft" /&gt;

When she was eleven, she was promoted to the rank of Cadet. This enabled her to move to better accommodation within the building and she was given more freedom of movement. If their statistics were on a rising trend they were allowed to go bowling (always in pairs; they were never allowed to go by themselves) and if they were awarded "Cadet of the Week" status they were given ice cream.&lt;ref name="Woodcraft" /&gt;

She moved on to the Cadet Technical Training Corps at age twelve or thirteen, studying the works of L. Ron Hubbard for eleven hours a day from Mondays to Saturdays. Conventional schooling was limited to ten hours on Sunday. There was little free time and no days off other than the Scientology "holiday" of Sea Org Day, plus Christmas Day. On one occasion she was allowed to go on a two-week trip. She left the Cadet Org when she was fourteen to join the Sea Org proper, and fled Scientology two years later.&lt;ref name="Woodcraft" /&gt;

The QI facility came to the attention of the Pinellas County police, who visited it. According to the county Sheriff, Greg Tita, the police "determined that there were signs of child neglect and abuse.  They wrote up a report and the case was forwarded to the juvenile office. However, Scientology lodged a complaint against the publication of the report in the press and won. It is still sealed today. I don't think that it has to do with a dispute over the investigation, they just wanted to make sure no information got to the public." According to Tita, runaway cadets were sent by the church to "the 
children's prison camp", the Rehabilitation Project Force.&lt;ref&gt;Botros, Mona &amp; Koch, Egmont R. "Gesucht wird...". ARD, Germany. Broadcast on April 2, 1997&lt;/ref&gt;

===England===
A Cadet Org facility existed at Stonelands, a mansion located in the southern English county of West Sussex near the village of [[West Hoathly]]. It housed the children of Sea Org members working at Scientology's UK headquarters a few miles away at [[Saint Hill Manor]] in East Sussex. 
Claire Headley was four years old when she was placed there as one of about forty Scientologist children, with a single adult female Scientologist looking after all of them. Her mother, a single parent, worked at Saint Hill Manor but was allowed very little time to interact with her daughter: an hour a day at dinnertime and three hours on Saturdays. Children were allowed to join the church's permanent staff at the age of eight, but there was no provision for schooling at the facility.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Reitman|first=Janet|title=Inside Scientology|year=2011|page=313|publisher=Houghton Mifflin Harcourt|location=New York City|isbn=978-0-618-88302-8}}&lt;/ref&gt; Headley later recalled:

{{quote|We had no parents. So instead we were raised by checklists and statistics. I was responsible for eight children who were all around my age. I had to make sure they followed their checklists – made their beds, showered, brushed teeth, ate meals, went to school, did the manual labor tasks we were assigned, studied Scientology. We were assigned statistics driven by how much of the checklist we completed.

There was the time when I was 7 when my mother was sent to the RPF, Rehabilitation Project Force, for having sex with her boyfriend at the time. Why was this memorable? Because I was informed that this assignment meant I was not allowed to talk to her, and I was assigned to a “foster” family who would “keep an eye” on me for the duration of her time on the program.&lt;ref name="Headley" /&gt;}}

Headley says that, like cadets in a number of other Cadet Org facilities, she experienced various forms of abuse: "My experiences were by no means extreme. Physical and verbal abuse, sexual abuse, molestation and extreme neglect were very common experiences for cadets. I’ve often found it difficult to share my experiences, because I resent the idea of being considered a science project. At age 7, an older male staff member tried to lure my friend and I to his office to molest us. I refused to go with him and urged my friend not to go with him. My friend chose to go and he molested her. This was never reported to the police."&lt;ref name="Headley"&gt;{{cite web|url=https://tonyortega.org/2017/06/25/claire-headley-on-growing-up-in-scientology-and-other-howdycon-highlights/|title=Claire Headley on growing up in Scientology, and other HowdyCon highlights|last=Ortega|first=Tony|work=The Underground Bunker|date=June 25, 2017|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another former Cadet Org member, Melissa Paris,  says that the Sea Org governesses regularly hit the children, who also ganged up on each other. On one occasion, she writes, she was thrown down the stairs by one governess, which led to a rare intervention from her father.&lt;ref name="Melissa" /&gt;

Paris lived at Stonelands between the ages of four and twelve. She recalled that her day started around 7 am, when "we'd muster – we'd all stand in a line, according to divisions. Then we had to breakfast on time, because if you missed it, you didn't eat. Then some would go to Saint Hill and do their jobs. Others would stay at Stonelands and had to clean the house. There wasn't much free time, maybe an hour or two. When I was younger there had been something called Family Time, an hour or two in the evening when you saw your parents". Family Time was abolished when she was about six or seven, meaning that she no longer saw her father during the day.&lt;ref name="Melissa"&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.villagevoice.com/2011/12/01/melissa-paris-valeskas-sister-and-her-own-ordeal-in-scientologys-cadet-and-sea-orgs-forced-to-marry-at-16/|title=Melissa Paris, Valeska’s Sister, And Her Own Ordeal in Scientology’s Cadet and Sea Orgs: Forced to Marry at 16|work=The Village Voice|last=Ortega|first=Tony|date=December 1, 2011|accessdate=August 23, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Paris, the mansion was in a run-down state and she experienced grim conditions. Her sister Valeska, who was also at Stonelands, says that "we had no toilet paper 90 percent of the time in the Cadet Org. We either had to use pages from books in the library to wipe ourselves or our hands and wipe it on the wall. I know it's gross but it's true. The toilet had shit all over the wall." Not surprisingly, personal hygiene suffered: "We were Stonelands kids. Dirty. We had lice."&lt;ref name="Melissa" /&gt;

Conditions at Stonelands were still poor a decade later. In 1993, Mid-Sussex District Council prosecuted the Church of Scientology for breaches of fire safety regulations after another Scientology property in the area burned down. Although the Church had declared that 50 people were living there, an internal Scientology document inspection listed more than 190 residents. At least 24 children were living in dormitories of which a Scientology official noted, "Smell[s] of wet beds and bleach ... smell of wet beds needs to be handled."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news|url=https://www.independent.co.uk/news/uk/cult-prosecuted-over-safety-of-commune-scientologists-deny-misleading-council-on-overcrowding-1466269.html|title=Cult prosecuted over safety of commune: Scientologists deny misleading council on 'overcrowding'|last1=Kelsey|first1=Tim|last2=Ricks|first2=Michael|work=The Independent|date=December 9, 1993|accessdate=August 22, 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Mexico===
In 1982, former Scientologist Scott Mayer testified in a public hearing in Clearwater, Florida that he had been responsible for maintaining a Cadet Org facility in Mexico for the children of Los Angeles-based Scientologists. They were kept there rather than in the United States as it was said to be cheaper. According to Mayer, "Children were routinely transported from Los Angeles to the Mexican base and berthed and housed there...so that their mothers and fathers could get on with their business within the Church." However, the Mexican base was unsafe: it was raided at night by thieves who would come in and steal items from the property. Mayer was ordered to procure a rifle with an infrared sniper scope to deal with the thieves. However, it was not needed as the woman who ran the base shot one of the bandits and deterred them from returning.&lt;ref name="Atack"&gt;{{cite book | last = Atack | first = Jon | authorlink = Jon Atack | year = 1990 | title = [[A Piece of Blue Sky]] | publisher = Carol Publishing Group | location = New York, NY | isbn = 0-8184-0499-X | page=277}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The physical conditions at the base were also extremely hazardous. The property was thickly covered with brush, which grew right up to the ranch house, and there were poisonous scorpions, snakes and spiders in the area. No money or personnel were initially available to deal with these problems. Mayer eventually resolved the situation by taking a jar of scorpions to his superior and telling him that a child's death would cause bad public relations for Scientology.&lt;ref name="Atack" /&gt;

===Australia===
Sea Org members living in Australia sent children to a Cadet Org facility located in a Sydney townhouse in the 1990s. Scarlett Hanna, who lived there for several years, described it as "an incredibly lonely childhood. I had no-one to talk to or to look after to me or to ask me how I was after school or, you know, any of those things that most of us take for granted." She said that she and the other children did not receive adequate food or medical care.&lt;ref name="Cannane"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.abc.net.au/lateline/content/2010/s2903129.htm|title=Scientology president's daughter slams 'toxic' church|last=Cannane|first=Steve|publisher=Australian Broadcasting Corporation|date=18 May 2010|accessdate=23 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to Hanna, the Sea Org successfully managed to conceal the children's living conditions from the city's Community Services department when the facility was inspected on two occasions. She said that the furniture was dismantled and the children were sent out for the day to make it appear that the facility was not overcrowded.&lt;ref name="Cannane" /&gt;

==Decline and fall of the Cadet Org==

The management of its child members was a long-running source of difficulties for the Church of Scientology. In 1974, only a year after Hubbard announced the creation of the Cadet Org, it was sued for running an illegal child care facility and was put on probation. Five years later, it had a narrow escape when the Los Angeles County authorities discovered that the church was running another illegal child care facility in the Cadet Org's building on Fountain Avenue, Los Angeles. The church was able to escape indictment after being tipped off that a raid was imminent and moved the children into another, legally compliant, building.&lt;ref name="Lamarr" /&gt;

Serious problems nonetheless persisted in Los Angeles. An "Aides Order" published internally by the Sea Org in August 1981 reported that in the Los Angeles-based Pacific Area Command alone, there were 339 children aged between newborn and 18 in the PAC Sea Org organizations. (In 1974 there had only been 20 parents in the entire PAC Sea Org.) The way they were being managed was causing numerous problems. The minute noted that they were behind their grade level in the public school system and there were numerous reports of unethical and criminal misbehavior by Sea Org children, including theft and sexual misconduct. It stated: "Due to the recent filthy conditions of the [Cadet Estates Organization] and the criminal behavior of the children the area has become a PR and Legal threat to the Church ... the scene is wildly off the rails and the scene has become very degraded. PAC SO children instead of becoming valuable personnel assets are in many cases becoming criminals."&lt;ref name="AidesOrder"&gt;Price, Larry. "PAC Cadet Org/Cadet Estates Org Establishment Eval". Aides Order 203–71. 28 August 1981&lt;/ref&gt;

A series of "missions" by Scientology management through the 1970s attempted to resolve these problems but failed, which the 1981 Aides Order attributed to a failure to follow L. Ron Hubbard's dictates. For instance, parents and the children's adult supervisors caused problems "by treating them as "kids" rather than SO members. This was often covert such as parents insisting that their cadet go on libs [spend time] with them even though the cadet's stats were down and he hadn't earned a libs, resulting in degrade of the cadet's post". The order advised that parents should be "re-educated" to regard their children as "resources and real SO members." It commented that "since the destructive cultural pattern of handling children is deeply ingrained in the US this would need to be stripped off as false data" and concluded that the parents "do not view children as a [Present Time] resource worth investing a lot of time or effort in."&lt;ref name="AidesOrder" /&gt;

Further problems were caused by the quality of the adult personnel assigned to look after the cadets. The Aides Order reported that the Commanding Officer of the Cadet Org "was criminal and sadistic to other Cadets. He was removed mid 77 after he handcuffed another Cadet to an electrical outlet and nearly electrocuted him." A subsequent investigation found that the Cadet Estates Organization "also had a large number of DBs [Degraded Beings], criminals and perverts posted in it. Some of these would slap the cadets around and treat them like "kids"." This was due at least in part to the fact that the Sea Org had "continually put their unwanted or reject staff" into looking after children. To resolve these problems, the Aides Order proposed a series of reforms which would improve the management of the Cadet Org and make the Cadet Estates Org, which looked after their facilities, an entirely separate body exclusively managed by adults. Sea Org members with a history of sexual misconduct were to be removed from Cadet Org and Cadet Estates Org staff.&lt;ref name="AidesOrder" /&gt;

However, the problems with pedophilia and poor living conditions evidently persisted, as a December 1989 minute from the Commanding Officer of the Cadet Estates Organization (CO CEO) to the Commanding Officer of the Commodore's Messenger Organization Pacific Area Command (CO CMO PAC) made clear: "The school is a disgrace, with could [sic] food fed to the children as there is no way to keep it hot, 90% of all children under grade level, etc."&lt;ref name="CO CEO" /&gt; A Sea Org member who was a qualified teacher was removed from his post due to his admission that he was feeling sexual urges towards the children. The teacher's confession was quoted in the minute:

{{quote|When I was a nanny for the first ten months of being in the SO [Sea Org] I would ofter [sic] pick up the kids and give them a hug or sit them on my lap. Sometimes when I would do this I would get an erection ... One time I was riding and one of the primary girls wanted to sit on my lap. I let her and after she was sitting on my lap I got an erection. I felt embarassed [sic] and moved her down near my knees. The reaction turned of [sic] after a bit ... One of the junior cadets I was putting to bed at night wanted me to give her a back rub to help her go to sleep. When I did this I got an erection.&lt;ref name="CO CEO"&gt;CO CEO minute to CO CMO PAC, 20 December 1989&lt;/ref&gt;}}

In the end, the Cadet Org was shut down entirely. The first step was taken in 1979 when Sea Org members in Los Angeles were forbidden to have children, and people with children were mostly forbidden to join the Sea Org. An Executive Directive was issued which stated:

{{quote|We have a lot of work to do on the third dynamic [saving the planet] here in PAC and a lot to handle and the time and work having to be expended to cope with the expanding baby population at CCO [Child Care Org] can be better directed toward this.

FROM NOW UNTIL THERE ARE ADEQUATE FACILITIES AND PERSONNEL FOR THE CCO AND THAT ORG IS SET UP TO HANDLE BOTH EXISTING SEA ORG CHILDREN AND FUTURE EXPANSION, THERE ARE TO BE NO MORE BABIES OR PREGNANCIES IN PAC. Any couple violating this rule will be subject to immediate Fitness Board to determine whether they are sufficiently a facility differential to their org and the Sea Org to warrant the expense, manpower and space required to care for their child. If the Fitness Board finds that they are not, they will be routed out.

Any person recruited for a PAC Org who has children must be weighed against his value to the SO versus the expense and work of caring for the child or children.&lt;ref&gt;LRH Comm Network International. "Pregnancies and Babies in PAC." Executive Directive Network 26 PAC of June 29th, 1979.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

As a Church website puts it, "by 1986 it had become apparent that the duties of a member of the Sea Organization were not compatible with raising children."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=ARE YOUNG CHILDREN PERMITTED IN THE SEA ORGANIZATION?|url=http://www.scientologynews.org/faq/are-young-children-permitted-in-the-sea-organization.html|publisher=Church of Scientology International|accessdate=20 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; A new Sea Org-wide directive was issued in September 1986 which prohibited Sea Org members from having children as the Sea Org did not have the time, money or resources to look after them. Having children was deemed to undermine the purpose and production of Sea Org members. If they disobeyed the Flag Order they would be sent to a distantly located Scientology organization of the Class V level (a medium-level Scientology organization). They could return to the Sea Org once the unauthorized child was six years old. However, Sea Org members continued having children so the new policy was reissued and strengthened in another Flag Order of April 3, 1991. The penalty for having a child was increased; violators would now be sent to "a small non-expanding Class IV org".&lt;ref&gt;Lesevre, Guillaume. "Children, Sea Org Members and Sea Org Orgs Addition". Flag Order 3501-1, 3 April 1991&lt;/ref&gt;

Mary Tabayoyon, who was a Sea Org member for 21 years, wrote that this was regarded as a severe punishment: "In a failing Class IV Org an exiled Sea Org member would have to fend for himself or herself and try and raise a child on the nominal compensation provided to the staff of a failing Class IV Org.  In addition, the exiled Sea Org members would be obligated to revive the failing Org or suffer more Ethics [disciplinary] conditions." In addition, any Sea Org colleagues who knew about an unauthorized child or pregnancy but did not take action against the parents would be punished. The result of the new rules was that many female Sea Org members who were desperate to remain in the Sea Org after getting pregnant had abortions instead, allegedly under the pressure of threatened disciplinary action.&lt;ref&gt;Affidavit of Mary Tabayoyon. 26 August 1994&lt;/ref&gt;

As a result of the new rules, the Cadet Org was no longer required and was dissolved in the early 2000s.&lt;ref name="Cannane" /&gt;

'''Ceremonial drums''' are used in a ritual context by indigenous peoples around the world, often accompanied by singing or chanting.

In the circumpolar regions the drums have been classified by traits such as the knob, frame design, size, membrane motifs, ornaments, etc. There are therefore two main groups of drums: those with internal and those with external knobs. Drums with internal knobs are found amongst the [[Chukchi people|Tjuktjer]] in Asia and among North American [[Inuit]]. Drums with external knobs are more widespread and are divided into four types:
* West Siberian: ([[Khant peoples|Khant]], [[Mansi people|Mansi]], [[Nenets people|Nenets]])
* South Siberian: (groups living above and in the mid regions of the [[Yenisei River]]). This type has many variations (Sajano-Yeniseic, Sjoric, Altaic)
* Mid Siberian: This type has two variants, Evenki-Yakutic and Nganasans-Entsic.
* Middle East: ([[Nanay]]ians, [[Udegey]]ians, [[Ulch people|Ulchians]], [[Nivkhs|Nivkhians]], [[Ainu people|Ainu]], [[Evenk peoples|Evenkians]], [[Buryats]]ians, [[Yukagir]]ians, [[Dolgans|Dolganians]], [[Oroch people|Orochs]], [[Oroks|Orokians]], [[Negidals|Negidalians]] and [[Zabaykalska Evenkians]], that is [[Evenks|Evenkians]] from the region far [[Lake Baikal]], where two types are characteristic: Amursic and Zabaykalic)

&lt;!--
* South Siberian type (groups living above and mid regions of the Jenisej river) and has many variations (Sajano-Jenisejska, Sjoriska, Altaiska)
* Mid Siberian type with two variants (Evenkic-Jakutic and Nganasansic-Entsic)
* Middle East type (Nanajer, Udegejer, Ultjer, Nivcher, Ainu, Evenker, Burjater, Jukagirer, Dolganer, Orotjer, Oroker, Negidaler and Zabajkalska Evenkians, i.e. [[evenks|Evenkians]] from the region far [[Lake Baikal]], where also two types are characteristic: Amurska and Zabajkalska)
--&gt;

The historical [[Sami people|Saami]] drum, sometimes termed [[rune drum]], belonged to the South Siberian kind, Sajano-Yeniseic subtype. (Those are, however, very similar to the Sjoric subtypes.) The Sami word for drum is 'goavddis', 'goabdes ' or 'gievrie' and the Altaic term is 'komus'. The Sami drum-stick term is 'bállin'; the Altaic term is 'orba'. 

&lt;!-- And finally, the Sami term for shaman is naida (noajdde); the Mansi term is nait. The Saami drums are further divided into the following classes:
* Frame drum
** Svept frame drum (or Åsele type) -
** Ring drum -
** Angle drum - 
--&gt;

Sister '''Christina Ebner, [[Dominican Order|O.P.]]''' (also '''Christine'''), (26 March 1277 – 27 December 1356) was a [[German people|German]] [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[nun]], writer and [[mysticism|mystic]].

==Biography==
Ebner was born in the [[Imperial City of Nuremberg]], the child of the [[patrician (post-Roman Europe)|patrician]] Seyfried Ebner and his wife, Elizabeth Kuhdorf. In 1289, at the age of twelve, she entered the [[Monastery]] of [[St. John the Baptist]] in [[Engelthal]], which was a community of [[nun]]s of the [[Dominican Order|Dominican]] [[Second Order (religious)|Second Order]] outside the city, in the [[Burgraviate of Nuremberg]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Theorizing Religions Past: Archaeology, History, and Cognition|author=Harvey Whitehouse, Luther H. Martin|year=2004|publisher=Rowman Altamira|isbn=0-7591-0621-5|page=130}}&lt;/ref&gt; Founded as a [[beguinage]] some fifty years earlier, over the next hundred years this monastery was to become a much-renowned center of spirituality and learning. According to some, it might very well have been the foremost center of mystical life during the early fourteenth century in Germany, if not all of Europe.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monasticmatrix.usc.edu/monasticon/?function=detail&amp;id=1310 Monastic Matrix "Ebenthal"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110527163440/http://monasticmatrix.usc.edu/monasticon/?function=detail&amp;id=1310 |date=2011-05-27 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Less than a year later after her admission, Christina fell gravely ill. This affliction would reappear up to three times a year for the next decade. Also, later, she frequently suffered from various illnesses. About this time, she began experiencing frequent religious visions, which her [[confessor]], [[Friar]] Conrad of [[Füssen]], O.P., encouraged her to write down. So she began writing her first book, ''Leben und Offenbarungen'' ('' Life and Revelations'') in 1317. She continued to work on it at least until 1324. In 1338, she began a correspondence with the [[secular priest]] [[Henry of Nördlingen]], who was an enthusiastic propagator of mystic [[spirituality]] and literature. Through him, she started a correspondence with the Blessed [[Margareta Ebner]], who was also a Dominican nun actively involved in the spiritual movement of the period; but Margareta was no relative of Christina's in spite of the same family name "Ebner".

Around 1340, Christina started compiling the ''Book of Sisters'' (''Schwesternbuch''), a record of the mystical visions and life experiences of the other nuns in her monastery, called ''Von der genaden uberlast'' (''Of the Burden of Grace''). It can be attributed to Ebner, based on a 1451 manuscript.

Between 1344 and 1352, she wrote a second book of ''Revelations'' (''Offenbarungen'').&lt;ref&gt;See: Siegfried Ringler: Ebner, Christine. In: Verfasserlexikon. 2nd edition, tom 2 (1980), col. 297–302; Susanne Bürkle: Ebner, Christine. In: Walther Killy: Literaturlexikon. 2nd edition, tom 3. Walter de Gruyter, Berlin / New York 2008, p. 163b-165b.&lt;/ref&gt; In it, she deals with historical and political events of the time such as the riots at Nuremberg in 1348; the [[Earthquake of 1348|earthquake of the same year]]; the outbreak of the [[Black Death]]; the [[Flagellants]]' processions of 1349; and the long quarrel between the [[Holy Roman Emperor]] [[Louis the Bavarian|Louis IV]] and the [[Holy See]]. Christina does not limit herself to the role of a bystander. Instead, she takes a deep interest in the events, develops her own opinions about them and even actively tries to influence their course. By that time, her reputation had spread widely through Northern Europe. In 1350, the Emperor [[Charles IV, Holy Roman Emperor|Charles IV]] himself came to visit her at the monastery, seeking her guidance and prayers.

In 1351 she was finally visited for the first time by her long-time confidant, Henry of Nördlingen, who spent three weeks as a visitor to the monastery. At that time he gave her a copy of  [[Mechthild of Magdeburg|Mechthild's of Magdeburg]] mystic work ''Das fließende Licht der Gottheit'' (''The Flowing Light of the Godhead''), which is found reflected in her own later works and in those of the other nuns in the community.&lt;ref&gt;[http://monasticmatrix.usc.edu/vitae/index.php?function=detail&amp;id=618 Monastic Matrix "Christine Ebner"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20051228124402/http://monasticmatrix.usc.edu/vitae/index.php?function=detail&amp;id=618 |date=2005-12-28 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Ebner died in her monastery at Engelthal on 27 December 1356, in her 67th year of monastic life.

'''Diocese of Shirak''' ({{lang-hy|Շիրակի թեմ}} ''Shiraki t'em''), is one of the dioceses of the [[Armenian Apostolic Church]] covering the northern and middle parts of the [[Shirak Province]] of [[Armenia]]. It almost covers 2/3rds of the province, as the southern towns of [[Artik]], [[Maralik]], and their surrounding villages are excluded.

The diocese was officially founded on August 31, 1920, upon a kontakion issued by Catholicos [[George V of Armenia|George V]]. The seat of the diocese is the [[Cathedral of the Holy Mother of God, Gyumri|Cathedral of the Holy Mother of God]] in [[Gyumri]]. The prelacy building is located on Rizhkov street near the cathedral, at the centre of Gyumri.

==History==
In the final days of the [[First Republic of Armenia]], the diocese was established upon a ''[[kontakion]]'' issued by Catholicos George V on August 31,&lt;ref&gt;[http://shirakdiocese.am/patmutyun/arajnordner/ Catholicos Gevorg Surenyants]&lt;/ref&gt; after being separated from the [[Araratian Pontifical Diocese]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.shiraksec.am/general_links/about_us/patmutyun/patmutyun1.html Diocese of Shirak] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20140318135017/http://www.shiraksec.am/general_links/about_us/patmutyun/patmutyun1.html |date=2014-03-18 }}&lt;/ref&gt; 
[[File:Գյումրիի Նավատիպ շենքը 01.JPG|thumb|left|The prelacy building]]
The prelacy building of the Diocese of Shirak is located on Varpetats Street of Gyumri, near the [[Vartanants Square]]. It was designed by [[Hovhannes Katchaznouni]] and built at the beginning of the 20th century.

On December 2, 2012, the southern town of [[Artik]] and the surrounding 23 villages were separated from the Diocese of Shirak to form the newly established [[Diocese of Artik]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://hetq.am/arm/news/21146/hrchakvel-e-artiki-temy.html Հռչակվել է Արթիկի թեմը]&lt;/ref&gt;

Currently, the diocese has 8 active churches under its jurisdiction in the city of Gyumri, along with many other churches in the Shirak Province.&lt;ref&gt;[http://lc13754376.on-rev.com/Diocese/ekegheciner/ Churches of Shirak]&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=December 2009}}

'''Direct revelation''' is a term used by some Christian churches to express their belief in a communication from [[God in Christianity|God]] to a person, by words, impression, visions, dreams or [[Theophany|actual appearance]]. Direct [[revelation]] is believed to be an open communication between God and man, or the [[Holy Spirit]] and man, without any other exterior (secondary) means. Direct revelation from [[evil spirits]] can also occur.

Examples of this is seen in God communicating the [[Ten Commandments]] to [[Moses]] on [[Mt. Sinai]] (Exodus 34:4); or the devil communicating knowledge to [[Temptation of Christ|Jesus Christ during his temptation]] in the wilderness (Luke 4:1-12) or the appearance of an [[Angel of the Lord|angel]] to the [[wife of Manoah]] telling her that she shall bear [[Samson]] (Judges 13:2). Direct revelation is classified as [[special revelation]], but the word "direct" has come to make this type of revelation distinct.

==Pentecostal and Charismatic Christianity==
[[Pentecostal]] and [[Charismatic Christianity]] has always maintained that God directly speaks today through direct means such as [[dream]]s, [[Vision (spirituality)|visions]], voices, impressions, and signs (or meaningful coincidences). While these Christians have emphasized speaking in [[Glossolalia|tongues]] or even praying for [[Faith healing|healing]], for the longest time Charismatics have shied away from expressing the gift of [[prophecy]]{{dash}}which is the cause of these direct spiritual experiences. The reason for this is that Christian [[prophet]]s in history have often come into conflict with the pastors and religious authorities of the [[Catholic Church hierarchy|church hierarchy]]. Throughout church history, Christian prophets have usually been [[Christian mysticism|mystics]] or people that practiced divine [[contemplation]] or soaking prayer.

Various Christian groups throughout church history could be labeled "prophetic", because they have welcomed the gift of prophecy in their church meetings and lives: the [[Montanism|Montanists]], the [[Desert Fathers]], various orders of [[Christian monasticism|Catholic monasticism]] such as the [[Dominican Order|Dominicans]] and the [[Discalced Carmelites]], the [[Waldensians]], the [[Anabaptists]], the [[Jansenists]], the [[Quietism (Christian philosophy)|Quietists]], the [[Quakers]], the [[Camisard|French prophets]], various people in the [[Great Awakening]] and [[Second Great Awakening]], the [[Irvingites]], individuals in the [[Holiness movement]], the early [[Pentecostalism|Pentecostal movement]], the [[Latter Rain (post–World War II movement)|Latter Rain revival]], the [[Charismatic movement]], the [[Jesus movement]], the [[Vineyard Church|Vineyard]]; and especially the [[Apostolic-Prophetic Movement|Kansas City prophets]], the [[Toronto Blessing]] movement, and [[Bethel Church (Redding, California)|Bethel Church]] in Redding, California.

==The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints==
{{Main|Revelation (Latter Day Saints)}}
[[The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints]] (LDS Church) teaches that God restored direct revelation as recently as the nineteenth century by way of [[Joseph Smith]] and the [[First Vision]]. Since then, direct revelation has been the teaching and practice of the LDS Church. It is the belief of the Latter-day Saints that direct revelation is available to all mankind who diligently seek God with sincerity, and real intent.&lt;ref&gt;{{lds|Moroni|moro|10|4}}, [[Book of Mormon]], [[LDS Church]]&lt;/ref&gt; "Every devoted, obedient and righteous person on the earth has and does receive revelation from God."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authorlink= Bruce R. McConkie |last= McConkie |first= Bruce |title= [[Mormon Doctrine (book)|Mormon Doctrine]] |year= 1966 |page= 664 |contribution= Revelation }}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the LDS Church, there are two basic types of direct revelation, ''public'' and ''personal''. Public revelation refers to the revelation of God’s will to his chosen [[prophet, seer, and revelator|prophets, seers, and revelators]]. These revelations are to guide the church, its functions, direction, and doctrinal stance. "These public revelations usually illuminate scriptural passages that are doctrinal rather than those that are descriptive or directive."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |authorlink= Dallin H. Oaks |last= Oaks |first= Dallin H. |url= http://www.lds.org/ensign/1995/01/scripture-reading-and-revelation |title= Scripture Reading and Revelation |journal= [[Ensign (LDS magazine)|Ensign]] |date= January 1995 |page= 7 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Personal or private revelations pertains to that person's life. A person can receive personal revelation from God as would God's prophet, but the difference lies in its purpose. This revelation is to edify, enlighten and fill the soul of that person and assist them in their life, both in a general sense and a religious or spiritual sense. A person can receive private revelation for him/herself or for their immediate family, but will not receive this revelation for others outside their family or for the church. This revelation is considered an integral part of the life of the faithful.

Sometimes personal revelation has an effect upon nations or the world, but in a more indirect manner. In this sense God inspires certain people in history to impart knowledge and moral truths. Basically, God "enlightens" the ''works'' of certain people that have influence or will have influence upon the world. God apparently enlightened "great religious leaders of the world such as Muhammad, Confucius, and the Reformers, as well as philosophers including Socrates, Plato, and others. This was to bring whole nations to a higher level of understanding."&lt;ref&gt;{{citation |author1-link= David L.

According to legends, Lord [[Ayyappan]], the deity of Sabarimala is celibate. When he defeated the evil demoness ''Mahushasuri'', she turned into a beautiful young woman.

===Kerala High Court Verdict===
In 1990, S Mahendran started a petition, alleging that young women were visiting Sabarimala.&lt;ref name="indianexpresshistory" /&gt; The verdict on the petition came in 1991 where Justices [[K. S. Paripoornan|K. Paripoornan]] and [[K. Balanarayana Marar]] of the [[Kerala High Court]] banned entry of women between ages 10 and 50 from offering worship at Sabarimala, stating that such restriction was in accordance with the usage prevalent from time immemorial.{{sfn|KHC1991|loc=paragraph 44, (1)}} In addition, the High court directed the [[Government of Kerala]] to use the police force to enforce the order to ban entry of women to the temple.{{sfn|KHC1991|loc=paragraph 45}} The court observed thus:{{sfn|KHC1991|loc=paragraph 44, (3)}}

{{quote|Such restriction (restriction of women entry) imposed by the Devaswom Board is not violative of Articles 15, 25 and 26 of the Constitution of India. Such restriction is also not violative of the provisions of Hindu Place of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry) Act, 1965 since there is no restriction between one section and another section or between one class and another class among the Hindus in the matter of entry to a temple whereas the prohibition is only in respect of women of a particular age group and not women as a class.}}

===Supreme Court Verdict===
In 2006, six women, members of the Indian Young Lawyers' Association, petitioned the Supreme Court of India to lift the ban against women between the ages of 10 and 50 entering the Sabarimala temple. They argued that the practice was a violation of their constitional rights and questioned the validity of provisions in the Kerala Hindu Places of Public Worship (Authorisation of Entry) Rules act of 1965 which supported it.{{sfn|Hindu2006}}

In September 2018 the [[Supreme Court of India]] ruled that women of all age groups can enter Sabarimala temple.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news|url=https://www.ndtv.com/india-news/keralas-sabarimala-temple-must-allow-women-of-all-ages-says-supreme-court-ending-restriction-1923556|title=Women Of All Ages Can Enter Sabarimala Temple, Says Top Court, Ending Ban|work=NDTV.com|access-date=2018-09-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; The court ruled thus: {{quote|We have no hesitation in saying that such an exclusionary practice violates the right of women to visit and enter a temple to freely practice Hindu religion and to exhibit her devotion towards Lord Ayyappa. The denial of this right to women significantly denudes them of their right to worship.}}
The verdict was passed with a 4-1 majority where Chief Justice [[Dipak Misra]], and Justices [[A. M. Khanwilkar]], [[Rohinton Fali Nariman|R. F. Nariman]] and [[Dhananjaya Y. Chandrachud|D. Y. Chandrachud]] favoured permitting women to enter the temple, while Justice [[Indu Malhotra]] dissented.&lt;ref name="ecsc"&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Rautray |first1=Samanwaya |title=Women of all ages can enter Sabarimala Temple, rules Supreme Court |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/supreme-court-allows-women-to-enter-sabarimala-temple/articleshow/65989807.cms |newspaper=The Economic Times |accessdate=20 October 2018 |date=29 September 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Indu Malhotra said that every individual should be allowed to practice their faith irrespective of whether the practice is rational or logical. The Supreme Court observed that the custom of barring women was in violation of Article 25 (Clause 1) and Rule 3(b) of Kerala Hindu Places of Worship.&lt;ref name="ecsc" /&gt; The petition that led to this verdict was filed by the Indian Young Lawyers Association.{{sfn|SC2018}}

==Arguments against women entry==
Some women choose to not enter Sabarimala believing that it would be an insult to Malikappurathamma's love and sacrifice.&lt;ref name="legendNDTV"/&gt; Others believe that Ayyappan himself placed restrictions on women entering the temple because he wanted to be celibate, and the presence of women of reproductive age group would distract him from this cause.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last1=Harikrishnan |first1=Charmy |title=Why women should have the right to enter Sabarimala |url=https://economictimes.indiatimes.com/news/politics-and-nation/why-women-should-have-the-right-to-enter-sabarimala/articleshow/53996201.cms |newspaper=The Economic Times |accessdate=20 October 2018 |date=4 September 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="firstpostlegend"/&gt;&lt;ref name="newsclick"&gt;{{cite web |last1=S |first1=Yogesh |title=Celibacy of Ayyappa is an Excuse to Oppress Women: NewsClick |url=https://www.newsclick.in/celibacy-ayyappa-excuse-oppress-women |website=NewsClick |accessdate=20 October 2018 |language=en|date=2018-10-14 }}&lt;/ref&gt; Some argue that menstruating women could instead go to [[Attukal pongala]], a temple festival also known as 'women's Sabarimala',&lt;ref name="pongala"&gt;{{Cite news |title=Thousands of women offer 'Pongala' at Attukal Bhagavathy temple |url=https://www.thehindu.com/news/national/kerala/thousands-of-women-offer-pongala-at-attukal-bhagavathy-temple/article22908910.ece |newspaper=The Hindu |accessdate=20 October 2018 |language=en-IN |date=2 March 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; instead of wanting to go to Sabarimala.

==Arguments in favour of women entry==
Those in favour of allowing women entry to Sabarimala argue that menstruation is not impure, and that women have equal right to enter the temple.&lt;ref name="nm"&gt;{{cite web |author=Cris |title=Menstruation is not dirty, women are not impure: Campaign to counter myths in Kerala |url=https://www.thenewsminute.com/article/menstruation-not-dirty-women-are-not-impure-campaign-counter-myths-kerala-89647 |website=The News Minute |accessdate=20 October 2018 |date=8 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some pointed out that women are allowed to enter other temples of Ayyappan, so that the exception for Sabarimala is unusual and inconsistent.&lt;ref name="bbc"&gt;{{Cite news |title=The god who bars women from his temple |url=https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-india-45901014 |newspaper=BBC News |accessdate=20 October 2018 |date=19 October 2018}}&lt;/ref&gt; A frequent criticism is that claims that women are impure, based on the physiological process of menstruation, is gender discrimination.&lt;ref name="newsclick" /&gt;

According to the historian, [[Rajan Gurukkal]], there is "neither ritual sanctity nor scientific justification" for the argument of menstrual pollution. He notes that the shrine was originally a "cult spot" for a tribal deity, [[Ayyanar]] of local forest dwellers before it became a place of worship for Ayyappa in the 15th century. Unlike traditional Hindu beliefs that menstruation is impure, the tribals considered it to be auspicious and a symbol of fertility. They thronged to the temple along with their women and children of all ages until the 1960s. Gurukkal also notes that there is documented evidence of young [[savarna]] women making their way into the temple till the 1980s.{{sfn|Gurukkal|2018}}

The chief minister of Kerala, [[Pinarayi Vijayan]], said that his party ([[Left Democratic Front (Kerala)|LDF]]) has always stood for gender equality and therefore will provide facilities and protection for women pilgrims to Sabarimala.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |title=Women have the same right to worship as men: Pinarayi Vijayan on Sabarimala issue |url=https://www.indiatoday.in/india/story/women-have-the-same-right-to-worship-as-men-pinarayi-vijayan-on-sabarimala-issue-1369509-2018-10-17 |website=India Today |accessdate=20 October 2018 |language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stavrakopoulou has served as writer and presenter for a number of media productions relating to her scholarly interests. She contributed to [[Channel 4]]'s series ''The Bible: A History'' (2010), regarding the historicity of [[Moses]].&lt;ref name=SinghTelegraph_8Mar11/&gt; Her first primetime presentation was a three-part television series for the [[BBC2]] ''The Bible's Buried Secrets'' (2011;&lt;ref name=SinghTelegraph_8Mar11/&gt;&lt;ref name = RobertsRevoir_9Mar11/&gt; not to be confused with [[Nova (TV series)|NOVA]]'s 2008 [[The Bible's Buried Secrets|programme of the same name]]).&lt;ref name=SinghTelegraph_8Mar11/&gt;

These popular presentations, while being widely presented (e.g., the [[BBC2]] production has been appearing in the U.S. as an offering of [[PBS]] stations&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.wycc.org/schedule/#page=search&amp;day=20160330&amp;provider=Broadcast&amp;search=Did%20King%20David's%20Empire%20Exist%3F&amp;sorted=relevance|title=WYCC PBS Chicago - Schedule|author= WYCC Staff | date= 2016-04-03 | work=WYCC PBS Chicago | access-date=4 April 2016}}{{better source|date=April 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=April 2016}}), have met with mixed and some skeptical reviews, both in the U.K. popular press,&lt;ref name=SinghTelegraph_8Mar11/&gt;&lt;ref name = RobertsRevoir_9Mar11/&gt; and more broadly.&lt;ref name=LucieSmith_23Mar11&gt;{{cite journal | author = Lucie-Smith, Alexander | date = 2011-03-23 | title=Theologians ought to love this BBC series on the Bible. Too bad it gives in to Dan Brown-style silliness | journal = [[The Catholic Herald]] | url=http://www.catholicherald.co.uk/commentandblogs/2011/03/23/theologians-ought-to-love-this-bbc-series-on-the-bible-too-bad-it-gives-in-to-dan-brown-style-silliness/ | access-date=17 March 2011 | quote = [Quoting subtitle, etc.] &lt;small&gt;In its closing moments the episode last night gave up fact for opinion. / …in the closing moments of the programme that scholarship seemed to be given up in favour of what was, in fact, mere opinion. First, the doctor suggested that the cult of the angels and the saints in contemporary Christianity was a hangover from polytheism. This is completely false. The Blessed Virgin is not some sort of lineal descendant of Asherah. The Blessed Virgin is a human being, not a goddess; she represents all that humanity is called to be; if she loses her humanity, she would have no appeal to her fellow human beings. But Mary is one of us—that is the whole point of her. Second, the doctor suggested that monotheism presents God as exclusively male, and men thus like God, which leads to the marginalisation and repression of women.With a charge like this, where can one start? The polytheistic Greeks and Romans denied females all political rights, despite the fact that Athens was under the protection of the goddess Athene, and Rome under the protection of Juno. The Julio-Claudian rulers claimed descent from Venus, but were not noted for their feminism. The idea that polytheism is more friendly to women is simply unsupported by the facts. It is easy to claim and sounds good, but as a serious thesis, it deserves to be dismissed. How on earth did it find itself in what purported to be a serious programme about the Bible?&lt;/small&gt; }}&lt;/ref&gt;

Fr. Alexander Lucie-Smith, consulting editor of ''The Catholic Herald'' and theologian, said that the BBC's ''…Buried Secrets'' series "is the sort of television programme that theologians ought to cherish…".&lt;ref name=LucieSmith_23Mar11/&gt; He complained that in the second episode of the production, which addresses the origins of monotheism, that "…in [its] closing moments… scholarship seemed to be given up in favour of… mere opinion"; he took issue with Stavrakopoulou's suggestion that contemporary Christianity's views of Mary, saints, and angels were a holdover from the polytheistic religions, and that monotheism's presentation of God as exclusively male led to the marginalisation and repression of women.&lt;ref name=LucieSmith_23Mar11/&gt; He argues that the polytheistic Greeks and Romans religions featured female deities, but the cultures themselves denied females all political rights.&lt;ref name=LucieSmith_23Mar11/&gt;

[[John Barton (theologian)|John Barton]], Oriel &amp; Laing Professor of Interpretation [of biblical texts] at the [[University of Oxford]], in his ''Ethics in Ancient Israel'', comments thus on the conclusions and general disputes in one area that Stavrakopoulou is writing as theologian and historian:{{quote|[Stavrakopoulou] argues that the idea of the king and his entourage as worshipping in an official way—that is, in practice, in accordance with the kind of religious customs the prophets approved of—while the populace at large indulged in illicit cults, is wishful thinking. A particularly striking example is child sacrifice, which (she has argued) was regarded as normal by everyone in pre-exilic and exilic times, except prophets such as Jeremiah and Ezekial.&lt;ref&gt;On these points, Barton cites Stavrakopoulou's ''King Manasseh'' (2004) and her  "'Popular' Religion and 'Official' Religion: Practice, Perception, Portrayal" (in ''Religious Diversity,'' 2010), unfortunately, without page numbers.&lt;/ref&gt; And indeed the Old Testament itself, while strongly condemning such a practice, makes it abundantly clear that it was very common. The idea that it was popular rather than official reflects Old Testament condemnation, but probably not the reality on the ground at the time. Similarly, polytheism was fairly obviously common in pre-exilic Israel, but there is no particular reason to think it was more common among 'the people' than in the king's palace and, indeed, in the temple. / ''These matters are widely disputed,'' but so-called popular religion may well have been much nearer to official religion…&lt;ref name = BartonEthics2014&gt;{{cite book |  author = Barton, John | year = 2014 | title = Ethics in Ancient Israel | chapter =  | ref =  | location = Oxford, ENG | publisher = Oxford University Press | isbn = 0199660433 | pages = 88f  | url = https://books.google.com/books?isbn=0199660433 | access-date = 3 April 2016 | quote = }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;While this excerpt is not entirely an independent view—[[John Barton (theologian)|Barton]] is a fellow, more senior [[Oxonian]] who has collaborated with Stavrakopoulous (see '''Books''' subsection above)—it nevertheless indicates, according to this sympathetic colleague, that there is no preponderance of academic opinion on this matter, about which Stavrakopoulous writes (i.e., it is, in Barton's representation, "widely disputed").&lt;/ref&gt; [break in paragraph indicated, emphasis regarding disputed nature of views, added]}}

Christopher B.

Chinese folklore features a rich variety of [[ghost]]s, [[monster]]s, and other [[supernatural]] creatures. According to traditional beliefs a ghost is the spirit form of a person who has died. Ghosts are typically malevolent and will cause harm to the living if provoked. Many Chinese folk beliefs about ghosts have been adopted into the mythologies and folklore of neighboring East Asian cultures, notably Japan, Korea, and Vietnam. Beliefs about ghosts are closely associated with Chinese ancestor worship, where much have been incorporated into [[Buddhism]] and in turn influenced and created uniquely Chinese Buddhist beliefs about the supernatural.

Traditionally, the Chinese believed that it was possible to contact the spirits of deceased relatives and ancestors through a medium. It was believed that the spirits of the deceased can help them if they were properly respected and rewarded. The annual [[Hungry Ghost Festival]], celebrated in China (including Taiwan province, Hong Kong and Macao Special Administrative Regions), Malaysia, Singapore, and elsewhere in the Chinese diaspora, is dedicated to performing rituals to honor and remember the spirits of the dead. On this day [[ghost]]s and other supernatural creatures come out from the [[Underworld]] and move among the living. Families prepare food and other offerings and place them on a shrine dedicated to deceased relatives. Incense and paper money are burned and other rituals are performed in hopes that the spirits of the dead will protect and bring good luck to the family.

Ghosts are described in classical Chinese texts, and continue to be depicted in modern literature and movies.

==Terminology==
{{See also|List of supernatural beings in Chinese folklore}}

Guǐ (鬼) is the general Chinese term for ghost, used in combination with other symbols to give related meanings such as ''[[Gweilo|guilao]]'' (鬼佬), literally "ghost man", a pejorative term for foreigners, and ''[[Mogwai (Chinese culture)|mogwai]]'' (魔鬼) meaning "devil".&lt;ref&gt;Elizabeth Childs-Johnson (江伊莉), 甲骨文的“鬼”与假面具 (The Gui-Spirit in Oracle Bone Inscriptions), International Conference Celebrating the 95th Anniversary of the Discovery of Oracle Bone Inscriptions", Anyang, China, 1994.
&lt;/ref&gt;  Characters such as 魇 (yǎn) meaning "nightmare" also carry related meanings.&lt;ref name="Lafay"&gt;{{cite book |title=The Chinese Have a Word for It: The Complete Guide to Chinese Thought and Culture |last=Lafayette De Mente |first=Boyé |year=2000 |publisher=[[McGraw-Hill Professional|McGraw-Hill]] |location= |isbn=978-0-658-01078-1 |page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Yanluo.JPG|thumb|right|200px|Old Chinese painting depicting Yanluo, the ruler of Hell]]

[[Yama (East Asia)|Yan Wang]] ({{zh|t=閻王}}), also called Yanluo ({{zh|t=閻羅}}) is the god of death and the sovereign of the [[Diyu|underworld]]. He is also the judge of the underworld, and decides whether the dead will have good or miserable future lives.&lt;ref name="China Daily"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.china.org.cn/english/travel/230238.htm|title=Fright night|work=China Daily|date=October 31, 2007|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt; Although ultimately based on the god [[Yama]] of the Hindu [[Vedas]], the Buddhist Yan Wang has developed different myths and different functions from the [[Hinduism|Hindu]] deity.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author1=Nyanaponika Thera  |author2=Bodhi, Bhikkhu|year=1999|title=Numerical Discourses of the Buddha: An Anthology of Suttas from the Anguttara Nikaya|publisher=AltaMira Press|isbn=0-7425-0405-0}}&lt;/ref&gt; Yan Wang is normally depicted wearing a Chinese judge's cap in Chinese and Japanese art. He sometimes appears on Chinese [[Hell Bank Notes]].

[[Zhong Kui]] ({{zh|c=鍾馗}}) is the vanquisher of ghosts and evil beings. Portraits of him were hung in Chinese houses at the end of the Chinese lunar year to scare away evil spirits and demons. He is depicted as fierce man with a black face and a comic beard brandishing a magic sword. Zhong Kui is said to be himself the ghost of a man who failed to pass the civil service examinations and committed suicide. He then became a ghost hunter. There is a story that the [[Emperor Xuanzong of Tang]] once dreamed that a small ghost stole the purse of the imperial consort. A larger ghost - Zhong Kui - captured the smaller one and returned the purse.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.char4u.com/article_info.php?articles_id=114|title=A Fascinating Story of Ghost Hunter Zhong Kui|work=Char4U.com|accessdate=2010-04-07}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There has been extensive interaction between traditional Chinese beliefs and the more recent [[Confucianism]], [[Taoism]], and [[Chinese Buddhism|Buddhism]].

Ancestor worship is the original basic Chinese religion. The core belief is that there is a continued existence after death.&lt;ref name=religionfacts&gt;{{cite web

It is thought that the soul of a deceased person is made up of yin and yang components called [[hun and po]] (魂 and 魄). The yin component, po, is associated with the grave, and the yang component, hun, is associated with ancestral tablets . At death the components split into three different souls; the po stays with the body to the grave, another goes to judgment, and the hun resides in an ancestral tablet. The po and hun are not immortal and need to be nourished by offerings made by descendants. Eventually both the po and hun go to the underworld, although the hun goes to heaven first. Unlike in western usages of the term, underworld has no negative connotation.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[King Xuan of Zhou]] (827–783 BCE) according to [[Chinese mythology|Chinese legend]] executed his minister, Tu Po, on false charges even after being warned that Tu Po's ghost would seek revenge. Three years later, according to historical chronicles, Tu Po's ghost shot and killed Xuan with a [[Bow (weapon)|bow and arrow]] before an assembly of feudal lords. The Chinese philosopher, [[Mozi|Mo Tzu]] (470–391 BCE), is quoted as having commented:
&lt;blockquote&gt;"If from antiquity to the present, and since the beginning of man, there are men who have seen the bodies of ghosts and spirits and heard their voices, how can we say that they do not exist? If none have heard them and none have seen them, then how can we say they do? But those who deny the existence of the spirits say: "Many in the world have heard and seen something of ghosts and spirits. Since they vary in testimony, who are to be accepted as really having heard and seen them?" Mo Tzu said: As we are to rely on what many have jointly seen and what many have jointly heard, the case of Tu Po is to be accepted."&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.cic.sfu.ca/nacc/articles/legalmohist/mozi_mei/wadegiles/momei_31wg1.html ''The Ethical and Political Works of Motse] [Mo-tzu]'' Book VIII, Chapter XXXI "On Ghosts (III) Electronic republication of the translation by W.

Religious Taoism finally came together during the [[Han Dynasty]] (206 BCE–220 CE) around the time Buddhism was introduced to China, and it rose to predominance during the [[Tang Dynasty]] (618–907 CE), which initially tolerated its coexistence. Reverence for nature and ancestor spirits is common in popular Taoism. Banned during the Cultural Revolution (along with all other religions), Taoism is undergoing a major revival today,&lt;ref name=autogenerated1&gt;[http://www.arcworld.org/downloads/SCMP%20Daoism%2030%20April%202007.pdf Rebirth of Taoism fills spiritual void in rush to consumerism]&lt;/ref&gt; and it is the spirituality followed by about 30% (400&amp;nbsp;million) of the total Chinese population&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

[[File:Buddhism Mass in Ghost Festival.JPG|thumb|300px| A modern Buddhist ceremony held in [[Guanghua Temple (Beijing)|Guanghua Temple]] in [[Beijing]].]]
Buddhism was introduced into China in the 1st century CE, and rapidly became popular with its belief in a continuous cycle of rebirth and more complex ghost beliefs, although the older beliefs lingered. The entry of [[Buddhism]] into China was marked by interaction and [[syncretism]] with Taoism in particular.&lt;ref&gt;Maspero, Henri. Translated by Frank A. Kierman, Jr. ''Taoism and Chinese Religion''. p 46. University of Massachusetts, 1981.&lt;/ref&gt; Originally seen as a kind of "foreign Taoism", Buddhism's scriptures were translated into Chinese using the Taoist vocabulary.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

Elements of pre-[[Han Dynasty]] mythologies such as those in [[Shan Hai Jing]] were adapted into these belief systems as they developed (in the case of Taoism), or were assimilated into Chinese culture (in the case of Buddhism). On the other hand, elements from the teachings and beliefs of these systems became incorporated into Chinese mythology. For example, the [[Taoism|Taoist]] belief of a spiritual [[Heaven|paradise]] became incorporated into mythology, as the place where immortals and deities dwell.{{Citation needed|date=April 2010}}

The state of ancestor veneration in modern-day China is reported to be declining in areas that were more heavily affected by the hostility towards religion under the Communist Regime. However, in rural areas of China, as well as Taiwan, ancestor worship and its practices can still be commonly found.&lt;ref name=religionfacts/&gt;

==Practices and beliefs==

===Types of ghosts===
Many kinds of ghosts have been introduced throughout Chinese folklore and philosophy. In the ''[[Śūraṅgama Sūtra]]'', ghosts are depicted as the souls of wicked humans who, after undergoing punishment for their offenses in the afterlife, are eventually reborn as demons. Like the immortal ''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]'', the text describes ten types of ghosts, characterizing each type with their principal offense and their unique ability:&lt;ref&gt;Benn, James A. 2008, "[https://www.academia.edu/12082377/Another_Look_at_the_Pseudo-%C5%9A%C5%ABra%E1%B9%83gama_S%C5%ABtra Another Look at the Pseudo-Śūraṃgama sūtra]" pgs. 77-80&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://online.sfsu.edu/rone/Buddhism/Shurangama/Shurangama.htm Shurangama Sutra: Text, Commentaries, and Articles]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''[[Yaoguai|Weird ghosts]]''' ({{zh|妖鬼/怪鬼}}, ''{{transl|zh|yāoguǐ}}''/''{{transl|zh|guàiguǐ}}'') were consumed by materialism in life and can transform into any physical object.
*'''Drought ghosts''' ({{zh|魃鬼}}, ''{{transl|zh|báguǐ}}'') were consumed by carnal lust in life and can create hot, dry winds.
*'''Trickster ghosts''' ({{zh|魅鬼}}, ''{{transl|zh|mèiguǐ}}'') caused confusion in life and can transform into animals.
*'''Venomous ghosts''' ({{zh|蠱毒鬼}}, ''{{transl|zh|gǔdú-guǐ}}'') were hateful to others in life and can transform into insects.
*'''Pestilence ghosts''' ({{zh|疠鬼}}, ''{{transl|zh|lìguǐ}}'') harbored grudges in life and can cause disease and decay.
*'''[[Hungry ghost]]s''' ({{zh|饿鬼}}, ''{{transl|zh|èguǐ}}'') were arrogant in life and can take on gaseous forms.
*'''Nightmare ghosts''' ({{zh|魘鬼}}, ''{{transl|zh|yǎnguǐ}}'') were frauds in life and can transform into pure darkness.
*'''[[Wangliang|Goblin ghosts]]''' ({{zh|魍魉鬼}}, ''{{transl|zh|wǎngliǎng-guǐ}}'') were corrupted by their desire for insight in life and are formed from the [[Jing (Chinese medicine)|essential energy]] within rocks and trees.
*'''Servant ghosts''' ({{zh|役使鬼}}, ''{{transl|zh|yìshǐ-guǐ}}'') were corrupted by their desire for accomplishment in life and can transform into blinding light.
*'''Messenger ghosts''' ({{zh|传送鬼}}, ''{{transl|zh|chuánsòng-guǐ}}'') were litigious in life and can transform into any person.

Another classification is mentioned in '''A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms''' ({{zh|翻譯名義集}}, ''{{transl|zh|Fānyì Míngyì Jí}}''). There are nine types of hungry ghosts, all divided into three main classes:&lt;ref&gt;[http://mahajana.net/texts/kopia_lokalna/soothill-hodous.html A Dictionary of Chinese Buddhist Terms]&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://taotao-project.org/dictionary/%E9%AC%BC/ TaoTao-Project]&lt;/ref&gt;

*'''Ghosts without means''' ({{zh|無財鬼}}, ''{{transl|zh|wú cái guǐ}}''): 
**'''Torch-mouth ghosts''' ({{zh|炬口鬼}}, ''{{transl|zh|jùkǒu guǐ}}'') have mouths like burning torches. 
**'''Needle-mouth ghosts''' ({{zh|針口鬼}}, ''{{transl|zh|zhēnkǒu guǐ}}'') have mouths no bigger than needles, so they cannot satisfy their hunger or thirst. 
**'''Foul-mouth ghosts''' ({{zh|臭口鬼}}, ''{{transl|zh|chòukǒu guǐ}}'') have vile breath, disgusting even to themselves.
*'''Ghosts with small means''' ({{zh|少財鬼}}, ''{{transl|zh|shǎo cái guǐ}}''):
**'''Needle-hair ghosts''' ({{zh|針毛鬼}}, ''{{transl|zh|zhēnmáo guǐ}}'') have hair like iron needles, distressing to themselves and others. 
**'''Smelly-hair ghosts''' ({{zh|臭毛鬼}}, ''{{transl|zh|chòumáo guǐ}}'') have spike-like hair that emits an awful odor. 
**'''Tumour ghosts''' ({{zh|癭鬼}}, ''{{transl|zh|yǐng guǐ}}'') have large goiters on whose pus they must feed.

**'''Ghosts hoping for offerings''' ({{zh|希祀鬼}}, ''{{transl|zh|xīsìguǐ}}'') live on sacrificial offerings, usually from their descendants. 
**'''Ghosts hoping for leavings''' or '''ghosts that inhale energy''' ({{zh|希棄鬼/吸氣鬼}}, ''{{transl|zh|xīqìguǐ}}'') eat any human leftovers, and can even devour the ''[[qi]]'' of living beings.

The literary term '''Hero among ghosts''' ({{zh|鬼雄}}, ''{{transl|zh|guǐxióng}}'') refers to a person who has died a heroic death.

===Mediums===
The use of [[Medium (spirituality)|mediums]] to communicate with spirits is an important practice in traditional Chinese culture, and is closely linked to ancestor worship. The medium (mun mai poh, 問覡|問米) or ''"ask rice woman"'' helps to ask the ancestor what they require on the other side, and these needs can be provided through the burning of paper effigies. In return, the spirit can be of great help in matters such as winning the lottery or being admitted to low-cost government housing.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

===Ghost festival===
[[File:Sangha Day Hsi Lai Temple.JPG|thumb|300px|An array of foods being offered to the deceased during Ghost festival]]
{{Main article|Ghost Festival}}
The Ghost Festival ({{zh|t=盂蘭節}}) is a traditional Chinese festival celebrated by Chinese in many countries. The fifteenth day of the seventh month in the lunar calendar is called Ghost Day and the seventh month in general is regarded as the 'Ghost Month ({{lang|zh|鬼月}}), in which [[ghost]]s and [[spiritual being|spirits]], including those of the deceased ancestors, come out from the [[Underworld|lower realm]]. Distinct from both the [[Qingming Festival]] (in Spring) and [[Chung Yeung Festival]] (in Autumn) in which living descendants pay homage to their deceased ancestors, on Ghost Day, the deceased are believed to visit the living. The festival has a long history. A Japanese pilgrim gave a detailed account of the Ghost festival in the [[Tang Dynasty|Tang]] capital of [[Ch'ang-an]] in the year 840. In those day the festival was usually called by its Buddhist name of ''yu lan p'en''.&lt;ref name=teiser&gt;{{cite book

The Buddhists associate the Chung Yuan festival with the legend of Moginlin saving his mother from the underworld. In this story, the hero learns that his mother is starving in the underworld. He travels there, overcoming many difficulties, and offers her food. However, the food bursts into flames before she can eat. In despair, he asks [[Sakyamuni]] for advice. The Buddha tells him to find ten monks who will fast and pray together with him on the 15th day of the seventh moon. Moginlin follows this advice and finally manages to release his mother from her torments.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

On the fifteenth day the realms of Heaven and Hell and the realm of the living are open and Chinese would perform rituals to transmute and absolve the sufferings of the deceased. Intrinsic to the Ghost Month is [[ancestor worship]], where traditionally the filial piety of descendants extends to their ancestors even after their deaths. Activities during the month would include preparing ritualistic food offerings, burning [[incense]], and burning [[joss paper]], a [[papier-mache]] form of material items such as clothes, gold and other fine goods for the visiting spirits of the ancestors. Elaborate meals would be served with empty seats for each of the deceased in the family treating the deceased as if they are still living. Ancestor worship is what distinguishes Qingming Festival from Ghost Festival because the latter includes paying respects to all deceased, including the same and younger generations, while the former includes only older generations. Other festivities may include, buying and releasing miniature paper boats and [[lantern]]s on water, which signifies giving directions to the lost ghosts and spirits of the ancestors and other deities.&lt;ref name=teiser/&gt;

The modern festival of Chung Yuan Putu or "Mid-origin Passage to Universal Salvation" owes its origins to both the Buddhist [[Ullambana Sutra|Ullambana]] (Deliverance) Festival and the Taoist Chinese Ghost Festival, both of which honor the spirits of the departed, and which have now been combined. Historically, families offer sacrifices of the newly harvested grain to departed ancestors on this day. In some parts of China, believers make small roadside fires where they burn paper money and other offerings to appease the restless spirits that have temporarily been released from the underworld.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www1.chinaculture.org/gb/en_chinaway/2004-03/17/content_46337.htm |title=Chinese Ghost Culture |accessdate=2010-07-07 |publisher=Ministry of Culture, P.R.China |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20100711183047/http://www.chinaculture.org/gb/en_chinaway/2004-03/17/content_46337.htm |archivedate=2010-07-11 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

During the ghost festival, people try to avoid outdoor activities, getting married, or moving to a new house—especially at night.
It is thought that if a ghost finds someone in the street and follows them home, they and their family will have bad luck for the next year. People should also avoid bodies of water on Ghost day, since they may be caught and drowned by a Shuǐ Guǐ (水鬼), a ghost who had died through drowning and wants to return to life.
The Ghost Festival shares some similarities with the predominantly [[Mexico|Mexican]] observance of ''[[Day of the Dead|El Día de los Muertos]]''. Due to theme of ghosts and spirits, the festival is sometimes also known as the "Chinese Halloween".&lt;ref name="China Daily"/&gt;

===Hungry ghosts===
[[File:Ghost Festival in Ping Chou.JPG|right|thumb|300px|Offerings are prepared for hungry ghosts during [[Ghost Festival|Ghost month]] in [[Hong Kong]].]]
{{Main article|Hungry ghosts in Chinese religion}}
Hungry Ghosts is a Chinese concept that differs from ghosts in Chinese tradition, it does not relate to buddhism. Traditional belief is that people become ghosts when they die.&lt;ref name="sixteen"&gt;{{cite book
 |title=The way to Buddhahood
 |author=Yin-shun
 |publisher=Wisdom Publications
 |year=1998
 |isbn=0-86171-133-5}}&lt;/ref&gt;
It was originally thought that ghosts did not have eternal life, but would slowly weaken and eventually die a second time.
Hungry ghosts in traditional thought would only be an issue in exceptional cases such a whole family was killed or when a family no longer appreciated their ancestors. With the rise of popularity in Buddhism the idea that souls would live in space until reincarnation became popular.&lt;ref name=teiser/&gt;
In the Taoist tradition it is believed hungry ghosts can arise from people whose deaths have been violent or unhappy. Both Buddhism and Taoism share the idea that hungry ghosts can emerge from neglect or desertion of ancestors.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

According to the Hua-yen Sutra evil deeds will cause a soul to be born in different realms. There are six possible realms of existence for souls.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The highest degree of evil deed will cause a soul to be born into a realm as a denizen of hell, the lower degree of that would cause a soul to be born as an animal, and the lowest degree would cause a soul to be born as a hungry ghost.&lt;ref name="thirteen"&gt;{{cite book

Evil deeds that lead to becoming a hungry ghost would be killing, stealing, and sexual misconduct. Desire, greed, anger, and ignorance are all factors in causing a soul to be reborn as a hungry ghost because they are motives for people to perform evil deeds. The least serious of these will cause one to have the destiny of becoming a hungry ghost.&lt;ref name="sixteen"/&gt;

===Miscellany===
When someone dies, it is important to perform the correct rites to ensure that the departed ancestor does not become a wandering ghost. Since the corpse, or at least the bones, continues to have powers that could affect the fate of living relatives, an expert in [[feng-shui]] is needed to determine an auspicious time, place, and orientation of the burial.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

In Chinese tradition, a [[Ghost marriage (Chinese)|ghost marriage]] (also known as a ''Minghun'' or ''spirit marriage'') is a marriage in which one or both parties are deceased.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

A ghost marriage was usually set up by the family of the deceased and performed for a number of reasons, including the marriage of a couple previously engaged before one member’s death, to integrate an unmarried daughter into a patrilineage, to ensure the family line is continued, or to maintain that no younger brother is married before an elder brother.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web

It tells the story of the monk Xuánzàng and his quest to bring back Buddhist scriptures from Vulture Peak in India.
Although some of the obstacle Xuánzàng encounters are political and involve ordinary human beings, they more frequently consist of run-ins with various goblins and ogres, many of in whom turn out to be the earthly manifestations of heavenly beings (whose sins will be negated by eating the flesh of Xuánzàng) or animal-spirits with enough Taoist spiritual merit to assume semi-human forms.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book

The '''Guiana United Muslim Party''' (GUMP) was a political party in [[Guyana]].

==History==
The party was set up in 1964 with assistance from the [[Central Intelligence Agency|CIA]] and the British authorities, and was led by Hoosein Ganie.&lt;ref name=SGR&gt;Stephen G Rabe (2006) ''U.S. Intervention in British Guiana: A Cold War Story'', Univ of North Carolina Press, p130&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.stabroeknews.com/2009/guyana-review/05/28/the-indian-presence-in-guyana/ The Indian presence in Guyana] Stabroek News, 28 May 2009&lt;/ref&gt; The American and British governments hoped the new party, together with the [[Justice Party (Guyana)|Justice Party]] (which the CIA was also funding), would take votes from the [[People's Progressive Party (Guyana)|People's Progressive Party]] (PPP), whose left-wing leanings they were concerned about.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.guyana.org/features/guyanastory/chapter174.html The 1964 election campaign] Guyana.org&lt;/ref&gt; Although the CIA estimated that the Justice Party and GUMP could win three seats in the  [[British Guiana general election, 1964|1964 general elections]],&lt;ref name=SGR/&gt; neither did; GUMP received only 0.5% of the vote and failed to win a seat,&lt;ref name=N1&gt;[[Dieter Nohlen|Nohlen, D]] (2005) ''Elections in the Americas: A data handbook, Volume I'', pp366-368 {{ISBN|978-0-19-928357-6}}&lt;/ref&gt; whilst the PPP emerged as the largest party, but was unable to form a government.

In the [[Guyanese general election, 1968|1968 elections]] it received only 0.3% of the vote and again failed to win a seat. The party did not contest any further elections.&lt;ref&gt;Nohlen, p365&lt;/ref&gt;

For over two millennia, texts in '''[[Chinese herbology]]''' and '''[[traditional Chinese medicine]]''' have recorded medicinal plants that are also '''[[hallucinogens]]''' and '''[[psychedelics]]'''. Some are familiar [[psychoactive plant]]s in Western [[herbal medicine]] (e.g., ''làngdàng'' 莨菪 "''[[Hyoscyamus niger]]'', black henbane"), but several Chinese plants have not been noted as hallucinogens in modern works (e.g., ''yúnshí'' 雲實 "''[[Caesalpinia decapetala]]'', cat's claw" flowers). Chinese [[herbal]]s are an important resource for the [[history of botany]], for instance, [[Zhang Hua]]'s c. 290 ''[[Bowuzhi]]'' is the earliest record of the [[psilocybin mushroom]] ''xiàojùn'' 笑菌 (lit. "laughing mushroom", "''[[Gymnopilus junonius]]'', laughing gym").

==Terminology==
There is a [[lexical gap]] between Chinese names and descriptions of hallucinogenic plants and English pharmacological terminology for hallucinogens, which are commonly divided into psychedelics, dissociatives, and deliriants.

The [[English lexicon]] has a complex [[semantic field]] for [[psychoactive drugs]], and most terms are [[neologism]]s (n.b., the following definitions are from ''[[Stedman's Medical Dictionary]]'' 2008).

''[[Hallucination]]'' (from Latin ''alucinor'' "to wander in mind") is defined as: "The apparent, often strong subjective perception of an external object or event when no such stimulus or situation is present; may be visual, auditory, olfactory, gustatory, or tactile." ''[[Hallucinogen]]'' (coined in 1952 from Latin ''alucinor'' and ''-gen'' "producing"): "A mind-altering chemical, drug, or agent, specifically a chemical the most prominent pharmacologic action of which is on the central nervous system (mescaline); in normal people, it elicits optic or auditory hallucinations, depersonalization, perceptual disturbances, and disturbances of thought processes."

[[Pharmacology]] divides hallucinogens into three classes. ''[[Psychedelic drug|Psychedelic]]'' (first used in 1956 from Greek ''psyche-'' "mind; soul" and ''delein'' "to manifest"): "Pertaining to a rather imprecise category of drugs with mainly central nervous system action, and with effects said to be the expansion or heightening of consciousness, LSD, hashish, mescaline, psilocybin." ''[[Dissociative]]'' is a class of hallucinogen that produces feelings of ''[[dissociation (neuropsychology)|dissociation]]'' (Latin ''dissocioatus'' "to disjoin, separate" from ''socius'' "partner, ally") meaning "(3) An unconscious separation of a group of mental processes from the rest, resulting in an independent functioning of these processes and a loss of the usual associations, a separation of affect from cognition." ''[[Dissociative disorders]]'' is defined as "a group of mental disorders characterized by disturbances in the functions of identity, memory, consciousness, or perception of the environment; this diagnostic group includes dissociative (older term, psychogenic) amnesia, dissociative fugue, dissociative identity (older term, multiple personality) disorder, and depersonalization disorder." ''[[Deliriant]]'' is a technical term introduced to distinguish hallucinogens that primarily cause ''[[delirium]]'' (1982, from Latin ''deliro'' "to be crazy" and ''delira'' "go out of the furrow"): "An altered state of consciousness, consisting of confusion, distractibility, disorientation, disordered thinking and memory, defective perception (illusions and hallucinations), prominent hyperactivity, agitation, and autonomic nervous system overactivity; caused by illness, medication, or toxic, structural, and metabolic disorders."

The equivalent semantic field in the [[Chinese language|Chinese lexicon]] comprises contemporary [[List of loanwords in Chinese#English|loanwords]] (n.b., translation equivalents are primarily from ''[[Wenlin]]'' v. 4.3, 2016). ''Huànjué'' (幻覺 "hallucination; delusion; illusion") [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] ''huàn'' (幻 "unreal; imaginary; illusory") and (''jué'''' 覺 "feeling; sensation; perception"). ''Zhìhuànjì'' (致幻劑 "psychedelic; hallucinogen") compounds ''zhì'' (致 "incur; cause"), ''huàn'' "unreal; imaginary; illusory", and ''jì'' (劑 "medicinal preparation; dose"). ''Zhìhuànyào'' (致幻藥 "hallucinogenic drug") with ''yào'' (藥 "medicine; drug") is a less common synonym.

''Míhuànyàowù'' (迷幻藥物 "psychedelic") combines ''míhuàn'' (迷幻 "phantasmagoric; surreal; mysterious; psychedelic") and ''yàowù'' (藥物 "medicine; pharmaceutical; medicament"). The Chinese technical names for the last two classes of hallucinogens are rare: ''Yóulíyàopǐn'' (游离藥品 "dissociative") compounds ''yóulí'' (游离 "dissociated; drifting") and ''yàopǐn'' (藥品 " medicine; chemical reagent; drug"); and ''Zhìzhānwàngyào'' (致谵妄藥 "deliriant") combines ''zhì'' "incur; cause", ''zhānwàng'' (譫妄 "(medical) delirium"), and ''yào'' "medicine; drug".

==History==
Chinese [[pharmaceutical]] literature mainly comprises texts called ''bencao'' ({{zh|c=本草|p= běncǎo|w=pen-ts'ao}}), translatable as English [[herbal]], [[pharmacopoeia]], or [[materia medica]]. This word [[compound (linguistics)|compounds]] ''ben'' "(plant) root/stem; basis, origin; foundation; book" and ''cao'' "grass; herb; straw". Although ''bencao'' is sometimes misinterpreted as "roots and herbs", the approximate meaning is "[pharmaceutics whose] basis [''ben''] [is] herbs [''cao'']" (Unschuld 1986: 14). These works deal with drugs of all origins, mainly vegetable but also mineral, animal, and even the [[Traditional Chinese medicines derived from the human body|human body]].

The Chinese [[botanist]], academic, and researcher [[Hui-lin Li]] (1911-2002) wrote seminal articles about the history and use of hallucinogenic plants in China. Li cites a story in [[Li Shizhen]]'s 1596 magnum opus ''[[Bencao Gangmu|Bencao gangmu]]'' as the first discussion about the general use of psychoactive plants. In 1561, after horrific murders in [[Changli County|Changli]], the [[Ming dynasty]] [[Jiajing Emperor]] proclaimed a nationwide edict warning about the dangers of hallucinogens.
&lt;blockquote&gt;Lang-tang (''Hyoscyamus niger''), Yün-shih (''Caesalpinia Sepiaria''), Fang-k'uei (''Peucedanum japonica'') and Red Shanglu (''Phytolacca acinosa'') all can cause hallucination in peoples. In the past, this significance has not been fully divulged. Plants of this kind are all toxic, which can obscure the mind, alter one's consciousness, and confuse one's perception of sight and sound. In the T'ang times, An Lu-shan [a foreign warlord in the Chinese army service] once enticed the Kitan [tribesmen surrendered to his command] to drink Lang-tang wine and buried them alive while they were unconscious. Again in the second month of the 43rd year of the Chia-ch'in period (1561 A.D.), a wandering monk, Wu Ju-hsiang of Shensi province, who possessed wizardry, arrived at Ch'ang-li and stopped over at the house of a resident, Chang Shu. Upon finding the latter's wife being very beautiful, he asked that the entire family sit together at the table with him when he was being offered a meal. He put some reddish potion in the rice and after a while the whole family became unconscious and submitted to his assault. He then blew a magic spell into the ears of Chang Shu and the latter turned crazy and violent. Chang visualized his entire family as all devils and thereby killed them all, sixteen altogether, without any blood shed. The local authorities captured Chang Shu and kept him in prison. After ten days, he spat out nearly two spittoonsful of phlegm, became conscious, and found out himself that those he killed were his parents, brothers, sisters-in-law, his wife, sons, sisters, nephews. Both Chang and Wu were committed to the death sentence. The Emperor, Shih-tsung, proclaimed throughout the country about the case. The particular magic potion must be of the kind of Lang-tang or similar drugs. When the man was under the spell, he saw everyone else as a devil. It is thus very important to find out the remedy that counteracts such a thing. (tr. Li 1977: 162)&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Notable plants==
The following eight examples of confirmed and possible hallucinogens recorded in Chinese herbals are primarily based on the ten in Li Hui-Lin's 1977 article. Two edible plants, with only one Chinese source and no Western ones mentioning psychoactive properties, are omitted as unlikely: ''fangfeng'' ({{zh|s=防风|t=防風|p=fángfēng |w= fang-feng}} "''Saposhnikovia divaricata''; [[Chinese parsnip root|Chinese parsnip]]") and ''longli'' ({{zh|s=龙荔|t=龍荔|p=lónglì |w=lung-li}} "''[[Nephelium]]'' topengii"; a type of [[lychee]]") (1977: 173-174).

===''Langdang'': ''Hyoscyamus niger''===
The ''làngdàng'' ({{zh|c={{linktext|莨菪}}|p=làngdàng|w=lang-tang}} "''[[Hyoscyamus niger]]''; black henbane") is one of the most famous hallucinogenic drugs in Chinese herbals. The seeds, which contain psychoactive [[tropane alkaloid]]s, are called'' làngdàngzi'' (莨菪子, with ''-zi'' "child; seed") or ''tiānxiānzi'' (天仙子 "heavenly [[Xian (Taoism)|transcendent]] seeds").

For use in medicine, the seeds are supposedly treated by soaking in vinegar and milk to reduce their toxicity. The ''[[Shennong Ben Cao Jing|Shennong Bencaojing]]'' says, "[The seeds] when taken [when properly prepared] for a prolonged period enable one to walk for long distances, benefiting to the mind and adding to the strength ... and to communicate with spirits and seeing devils. When taken in excess, it causes one to stagger madly." (tr. Li 1977: 166). Lei Xiao's 470 ''Leigong paozhilun'' (雷公炮炙論 "Master Lei's Treatise on the Decoction and Preparation of Drugs") states that the seed "is extremely poisonous, and when accidentally taken, it causes delirium and seeing sparks and flashes", and Zhen Chuan's c. 620 ''Bencao yaoxing'' (本草藥性 "Nature of Drugs in Materia Medica") says the seeds "should not be taken raw as it hurts people, causing them to see devils, acting madly like picking needles" (tr. Li 1977: 167).

===''Yunshi'': ''Caesalpinia decapetala''===
The ''yunshi'' ({{zh|s=云实|t=雲實|p= yúnshí |w=yun-shih}} "''[[Caesalpinia decapetala]]''; cat's claw") was a versatile drug plant in the Chinese pharmacopeia, and the root, flowers, and seeds were all used in medicine.

The ''Shennong Bencao'' says, "[The flowers] could enable one to see spirits, and when taken in excess, cause one to stagger madly. If taken over a prolonged period, they produce somatic levitation and effect communication with spirits." [[Tao Hongjing]], who edited the official [[Shangqing School|Shangqing Daoist]] canon, also compiled the c. 510 ''Mingyi bielu'' (名醫別錄 "Supplementary Records of Famous Physicians") that says "[The flowers] will drive away evil spirits. When put in water and burned, spirits can be summoned" and "The seeds are like ''langdang'' (''Hyoscyamus niger''), if burned, spirits can be summoned; but this [sorcery] method has not been observed." (tr. Li 1977: 167).

Li Hui-Lin notes this plant "has not been noted as a hallucinogenic plant in modern works. In fact, as far as I am aware, it has not been investigated medicinally or chemically" (1977: 168).

===''Fangkui'': ''Peucedanum japonicum''===
The ''fangkui'' ({{zh|c=防葵|p=fángkuí|w=fang-k'ui}} "''[[Peucedanum japonicum]]''") root is used in Chinese medicine, and, like the previous cat's claw, has not been noted as a hallucinogenic in modern works. The c. 510 ''Tao Hongjing mingyi bielu'' states, "Feverish people should not take it, because it causes one to be delirious and see spirits"; and Chen Yanzhi's (陳延之) c. 454-473 ''Xiaoping fang'' (小品方 "Minor Prescriptions") says that ''fangkui'', "if taken in excess, makes one become delirious and act somewhat like mad" (tr. Li 1977: 168).

''P. japonicum'' is also used quite extensively in Korean cuisine - not only as a culinary herb, but also as a leaf vegetable, raising the question as to what constitutes consumption 'to excess'. It may be the case that the strain of plant grown in Korea is less toxic / medicinal than that found in China, or that very substantial quantities of the plant must be eaten before any psychoactive effects are manifested. Alternatively, the psychoactive components of the plant may be deactivated by the cooking processes employed in the preparation of the plant in Korea.&lt;ref&gt;류, 수연 (20 April 2016).

===''Shanglu'': ''Phytolacca acinosa''===
The ''shanglu'' ({{zh|s=商陆|t=商陸|p= shānglù|w=shang-lu}} "''[[Phytolacca]] acinosa''; India pokeweed") has edible leaves and poisonous roots. China's oldest extant dictionary, the c. 3rd-century BCE ''[[Erya]]'' (13: 110) gives two names for pokeweed: ''chùtāng'' (蓫薚) and ''mǎwěi'' (馬尾 "horsetail").

Chinese herbals distinguish two kinds of ''shanglu'', white with white flowers and white root, and red with red flowers and purple root. The white root is edible when cooked but the red root is extremely poisonous. The ''Tao Hongjing mingyi bielu'' records how Daoists used the red variety, "By boiling or brewing and then taken, it can be used for abdominal parasitic worms and for seeing spirits"; [[Su Song]]'s 1061 ''Bencao tujing'' (本草圖經 "Illustrated Pharmacopeia") says, "It was much used by sorcerers in ancient times" (tr. Li 1977: 169). Su Gong's 659 ''Tang bencao'' (唐本草 "[[Tang dynasty]] pharmacopeia") says "The red kind can be used to summon spirits; it is very poisonous. It can be only used as external application for inflammation. When ingested, it is extremely harmful, causing unceasing bloody stool. It may be fatal. It causes one to see spirits." (tr. Li 1977: 170).

The 1406 ''[[Jiuhuang Bencao]]'' "Famine Relief Herbal" lists pokeweed as a [[famine food]]. It gives instructions for removing the poisonous phytolaccatoxin from the white roots and mentions Daoist ''[[Xian (Taoism)|xian]]'' using the flowers: "Cut them up into slices, scald, then soak and wash repeatedly (throwing away the extract) until the material is clean; then just eat it with garlic. … Plants with white flowers can (it is said) confer longevity; the immortals collected them to make savouries to take with their wine." (tr. Needham, Lu, and Huang 1986: 340-341).

===''Dama'': ''Cannabis sativa''===
{{main|Entheogenic use of cannabis#Ancient China}}
''Dama'' ({{zh|c=大麻|p=dàmá |w=ta-ma}} "''[[Cannabis sativa]]''; hemp; marijuana") has been grown in China since [[List of Neolithic cultures of China|Neolithic]] times. At a very early period the Chinese recognized the Cannabis plant as [[dioecious]], the male plants produce better fibers and the female plants produce more [[cannabinoid]]s. In modern usage, the names are ''xǐ'' ([[Wikt:枲|枲]] "male cannabis") and ''jū'' ([[Wikt:苴|苴]] "female cannabis") (Li 1973: 294).

Reflecting the importance of cannabis in ancient China, the ca. 3rd century BCE ''Erya'' dictionary (13) has four definitions: ''fén'' (黂/蕡) and ''xǐshí'' (枲實) mean "cannabis flower"; ''xǐ'' ([[Wikt:枲|枲]]) and ''má'' (麻) mean "cannabis" generally and not "male cannabis"; ''fú'' (莩, lit. "reed membrane") and ''mámǔ'' (麻母, "cannabis mother") mean "female cannabis"; and ''bò'' (薜) and ''shānmá'' (山麻 "mountain cannabis") mean "wild cannabis", possibly ''[[Cannabis ruderalis|C. ruderalis]]''.

The ''Shennong bencao'' calls "cannabis flowers/buds" ''mafen'' (麻蕡) or ''mabo'' (麻勃) and says: "To take much makes people see demons and throw themselves about like maniacs [多食令人見鬼狂走]. But if one takes it over a long period of time one can communicate with the spirits, and one's body becomes light [久服通神明輕身]" (tr. Needham and Lu 1974: 150). The ''Mingyi bielu'' records that in the 6th century, ''mabo'' were, "very little used in medicine, but the magician-technicians [''shujia'' 術家] say that if one consumes them with ginseng it will give one preternatural knowledge of events in the future." (tr. Needham and Lu 1974: 151, see [[cannabis and time perception]]). Meng Shen's c. 670 ''Shiliao bencao'' (食療本草 "Nutritional Therapy Pharmacopeia") says people will combine equal parts of raw cannabis flowers, [[Acorus gramineus|Japanese sweet flag]], and [[Podophyllum peltatum|wild mandrake]], "pound them into pills of the size of marbles and take one facing the sun every day. After one hundred days, one can see spirits." (tr. Li 1977: 171). Tang Shengwei's 1108 ''Zhenglei bencao'' (證類本草 "Reorganized Pharmacopeia") gives a more complete account on the pharmaceutical uses of cannabis: "Ma-fen has a spicy taste; it is toxic; it is used for waste diseases and injuries; it clears blood and cools temperature; it relieves fluxes; it undoes rheumatism; it discharges pus. If taken in excess, it produces hallucinations and a staggering gait. If taken over a long term, it causes one to communicate with spirits and lightens one's body." (tr. Li 1977: 170).

According to the sinologists and historians [[Joseph Needham]] and [[Lu Gwei-djen]], some early Daoists adapted censers for the [[religious and spiritual use of cannabis]]. The c. 570 Daoist encyclopedia ''Wushang Biyao'' (無上秘要 "Supreme Secret Essentials") recorded adding cannabis into ritual censers, and they suggest [[Yang Xi]] (330-c. 386), who wrote the Shangqing scriptures during alleged visitations by Daoist ''xian'', was "aided almost certainly by cannabis" (1974: 150-151).

===''Mantuolou'': ''Datura stramonium''===
[[File:Datura stramonium Bieluń dziędzierzawa Seed.jpg|thumb|''Datura stramonium'' fruit and seeds]]
The ''mantuoluo'' ({{zh|s=曼陀罗|t=曼陀羅|p= màntuóluó |w=man-t'o-lo}} "''[[Datura stramonium]]''; jimsonweed" or "(Buddhism) [[mandala]]") contains highly [[Datura#Toxicity|toxic]] [[Tropane alkaloid]]s. Several Datura species were introduced into China from India, and Li Shizhen's 1596 ''Bencao gangmu'' was the first herbal to record the medicinal use of flowers and seeds. The drug is used in combination with ''Cannabis sativa'' and taken with wine as an anesthetic for small operations and cauterizations. Li Shizhen personally experimented with jimsonweed and recorded his experience as follows: "According to traditions, it is alleged that when the flowers are picked for use with wine while one is laughing, the wine will cause one to produce laughing movements; and when the flowers are picked while one is dancing, the wine will cause one to produce dancing movements. [I have found out] that such movements will be produced when one becomes half-drunk with the wine and someone else laughs or dances to induce these actions." (tr. Li 1977: 172).

===''Maogen'': ''Ranunculus japonicus''===
[[File:Ranunculus japonicus 8.jpg|thumb|''Ranunculus japonicus'']]
The ''maogen'' ({{zh|c=毛茛|p=máogèn |w=mao-ken}} "''[[Ranunculus]] japonicus''; buttercup") is a poisonous plant with bright yellow flowers. The Daoist alchemist [[Ge Hong]]'s c. 340 ''Zhouhou jiuzu fang'' (肘後救卒方 "Remedies for Emergencies", tr. Li 1977: 172) says, "Among the herbs there is the Shui Lang (water Lang, a kind of Mao-ken) a plant with rounded leaves which grows along water courses and is eaten by crabs. It is poisonous to man and when eaten by mistake, it produces a maniacal delirium, appearing like a stroke and sometimes with blood-spitting. The remedy is to use licorice." Later herbals, which do not mention ''maogen'' as a deliriant, say the whole plant is considered poisonous and is should only be externally used as a medicine for irritation and inflammation.

===''Xiaojun'': ''Gymnopilus junonius''(?)===
[[File:Gymnopilus junonius-02.jpg|thumb|''Gymnopilus junonius'']]
[[File:Panaeolus papilionaceus (Bull.) Quél 183728.jpg|thumb|''Panaeolus papilionaceus'']]
The ''xiaojun'' ({{zh|c=笑菌|p=xiàojùn |w=hsiao-ch'un}} "laughing mushroom") was known to Chinese herbalists for centuries before modern botanists identified it as a type of [[psilocybin mushroom]], most likely either ''[[Gymnopilus junonius]]'' or Laughing Gym or ''[[Panaeolus papilionaceus]]'' or Petticoat Mottlegill.

The earliest record of a mushroom that causes uncontrollable laughter appears in [[Zhang Hua]]'s c. 290 ''[[Bowuzhi]]'' compendium of natural wonders, in a context describing two unusual kinds of ''jùn'' (菌 "mushroom; fungus") that grow on tree bark. 
&lt;blockquote&gt;In all the mountain commanderies to the South of the Yangzi, there is a fungus which grows [生菌] throughout the spring and summer on the large trees that have fallen down; it is known as the Zhen [椹 "chopping block (for execution)"]. If one eats it, it is tasty, but suddenly the poison takes effect and kills the eater. … If one eats Sweet gum tree growths [生者], they will induce uncontrollable laughter. If one drinks "earth sauce" [''tǔjiāng'' 土漿] one will recover. (tr. Greatrex 1987: 139) &lt;/blockquote&gt;

The ''Bencao gangmu'' records Tao Hongjing's recipe for preparing "earth sauce": "Dig out a pit three chi deep in a place where there is yellow earth. Take freshly-drawn water and pour it into the pit, stirring the water so as to make it turbid. After a short while, draw off the clear water and use this. It is called either 'soil sauce' or 'earth sauce'." (tr. Greatrex 1987: 264). Hui-lin Li quotes a Chinese-language study of "laughing mushrooms" that this "soil infusion" is the clear liquid after soil is mixed with water and allowed to settle, and an effective antidote for poisons (1977: 175).

Subsequent Chinese authors give many similar records. Chen Renyu's (陳仁玉) I245 ''Jùnpǔ'' (菌譜 "Mushroom Guidebook") says this fungus is named '' tǔxùn'' (土蕈 "earth mushroom") or ''dùxùn'' (杜蕈 "pear mushroom") and "grows in the ground. People believe it to be formed by the air from poisonous vermin, and kills people if taken.... Those poisoned by it will laugh. As an antidote, use strong tea, mixed with alum and fresh clear water. Upon swallowing this, it will cure immediately." (Li 1977: 175).

The c. 304 ''[[Nanfang Caomu Zhuang]]'' mentions sweetgum tree growths in a quite different context, the shamans in the southern state of [[Yue (state)|Yue]] use a magical ''fēngrén'' (楓人 "sweetgum person") that is a kind of ''liúyǐng'' (瘤癭 "[[gall]]") found growing on sweetgum trees. "When aged they develop tumors. Sometimes in a violent thunder storm, the tree tumors grow suddenly three to five feet in one night, and these are called Feng-jen. The witches of Yueh collect these for witchcraft, saying that they have proof of their supernatural quality." (tr. Li 1979: 77). Later sources gave two explanations of the sweetgum tree growths, either as galls that resemble humans and have magical powers or as parasitic plants with rain-giving powers (1979: 78-79).

In Japan, both medieval and modern sources record laughing mushrooms. An 11th-century story in the ''[[Konjaku Monogatarishū]]'' describes a group of Buddhist nuns who ate ''maitake'' (舞茸 "dancing mushrooms") and began to laugh and dance uncontrollably. It is also known as the ''waraitake'' (笑茸 "laughing mushroom"), which scholars have identified as the ''[[Panaeolus papilionaceus]]'' or Petticoat Mottlegill; the related ''[[Panaeolus cinctulus]]'' or Banded Mottlegill; and the psilocybin mushroom ''[[Gymnopilus junonius]]'' or Laughing Cap also called ''ōwaraitake'' (大笑茸 "Big Laughing Mushroom") (Sanford 1972).

In a study on early Daoist practitioners searching for the [[Elixir of life#China|elixir of Immortality]], Needham and Lu mention the possible use of hallucinogenic plants, such as ''[[Amanita muscaria]]'' "fly agaric" and ''xiaojun'' "laughing mushrooms". Based on [[Tang dynasty]] and [[Song dynasty]] references, they tentatively identify it as a ''[[Panaeolus]]'' or ''[[Pholiota]]'' and suggest that the properties of at least some psychoactive mushrooms were widely known. They predict the further exploration of hallucinogenic fungi and other plants in Daoism and in Chinese culture in general "will be an exciting task" (1974: 121).

The '''Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest''' ({{lang-la|Institutum Christi Regis Summi Sacerdotis}}, {{lang-fr|Institut du Christ Roi Souverain Prêtre}}) is a Roman Catholic [[society of apostolic life]] of [[pontifical right]]&lt;ref&gt;http://www.lancasterdiocese.org.uk/our-people-places/the-institute-of-christ-the-king-sovereign-priest/&lt;/ref&gt; in communion with the [[Holy See]] of the [[Catholic Church]]. The institute has the stated goal of honoring [[God]] and the sanctification of priests in the service of the Catholic Church and souls. An integral part of the institute’s [[charism]] is the use of the [[Tridentine Mass|traditional Latin liturgy]] of 1962 for [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and the other sacraments.&lt;ref name=institute/&gt; It has undertaken the restoration of a number of historic church buildings.

The institute's rule of life is based generally on that of the secular canons. The institute has its own [[choir dress]], adopted in 2006, which was given to members by the ([[Cardinal (Catholicism)|Cardinal]]) [[Archbishop of Florence]]. Its stated mission is the defense and propagation of the reign of Christ in all areas of human life, both private and social.

==Early years==
The institute was canonically erected on 1 September 1990 by Gilles Wach and Philippe Mora in [[Gabon]], Africa, where the institute still has missions,&lt;ref name=institute&gt;[http://www.institute-christ-king.org/institute/who-we-are/ "Who we are", Institute of Christ the King]&lt;/ref&gt; notably in the capital [[Libreville]]. Its canonical status was of diocesan right until October 7, 2008. On that date it was granted the status of pontifical right by decree, titled "Saeculorum Rex", of the Pontifical commission ''Ecclesia Dei'', on the occasion of the visit of Camille Perl, vice-president of the commission. Deacons and priests are incardinated into the institute, whose prior general has the right to call to orders. The institute is currently based in [[Gricigliano]], [[Italy]] in the Archdiocese of Florence. The international seminary of St. [[Philip Neri]] is also located there.&lt;ref name=Lueking&gt;[http://stlouisreview.com/article/2014-08-06/four-ordained Lueking, Dave. "Four ordained for Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest", ''St. Louis Review'', August 6, 2014]&lt;/ref&gt;

Wach currently serves as prior general and Mora as rector of the seminary. Both received their priestly formation under Cardinal [[Giuseppe Siri]] of [[Genoa]]. As of 2018 the institute numbered 114 priests. The Institute also includes clerical oblates, who go through formation but are not ordained as priests, and who help in the several apostolates of the Institute.&lt;ref name=Institute/&gt;

The charism of the institute is based on the example of its three patron saints:
*[[Saint Francis de Sales]],&lt;ref name=institute/&gt; who emphasized teaching the Catholic faith with patience and charity, and encouraging all Catholics to seek a life of holiness through the ordinary means of the church, such as devout attendance at Mass and frequent [[Confession (religion)|confession]].
*[[Benedict of Nursia|Saint Benedict]], with his love for the solemn celebration of the liturgy, his emphasis on work and prayer, his "Benedictine hospitality", and his role in laying the groundwork for an integral [[Christian civilization]] in medieval Europe.
*[[Saint Thomas Aquinas]], with his emphasis on the harmony between faith and reason.

The institute also honors as its primary patroness the Virgin Mary under the title of the Immaculate Conception. St. Teresa of the Child Jesus is the patroness of its African missions.

==Apostolates==
In the United States, the institute is located in [[Illinois]], [[Wisconsin]], [[Missouri]], [[New Jersey]], [[Connecticut]], [[California]], [[Arizona]], and [[Michigan]], with its national headquarters in Chicago. In Chicago, the institute is restoring the historic St. Clara/St. Gelasius Church on Carmelite Way. Upon completion it will become the Shrine of Christ the King.&lt;ref&gt;[http://shrinelandmark.org/ "Help Restore an Historic Landmark", ICKSP]&lt;/ref&gt; 

Its oldest United States apostolate is St. Mary Oratory in [[Rockford, Illinois]], and its newest is St Joseph Oratory in [[Detroit, Michigan]]. In [[Kansas City, Missouri]], in 2005, [[Robert Finn (bishop)|Bishop Robert Finn]] established an oratory (a public church where the Mass and other rites may be administered) for the institute at a historic church otherwise in danger of being closed.  The superior for the United States is Canon Matthew Talarico.

[[File:The Crescent showing Jesuits Church, Limerick (5691906208).jpg|thumb|The Crescent showing Jesuits Church, Limerick]]

The institute is active in the dioceses of [[Roman_Catholic_Archdiocese_of_Liverpool| Liverpool]],  [[Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Lancaster |Lancaster]], [[Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_Shrewsbury|Shrewsbury]] and [[Roman_Catholic_Diocese_of_East_Anglia|East Anglia]] in [[Great Britain]]; in 2011 the Bishop of Shrewsbury invited the institute to re-open the church of Saints Peter, Paul and Philomena in New Brighton. 

Since St. Patrick's Day, March 17, 2006, the institute has had a presence in the [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Limerick|Diocese of Limerick]] in the [[Republic of Ireland]]. In Limerick they purchased Sacred Heart Church,&lt;ref&gt;[http://reginamag.com/institute-christ-king-sovereign-priest/ Berry, Donna Sue. "How the Light of the Gospel is Returning to Limerick", ''Regina magazine'']&lt;/ref&gt; Since May 2010, the institute in Ireland has expanded into the diocese of [[Roman Catholic Diocese of Galway, Kilmacduagh and Kilfenora|Galway]] where weekly Mass is offered at St Mary on the Hill, [[Claddagh]]. Monthly Masses are offered by priests of the Institute in Ennis every first Sunday of the month and in Belfast every second Sunday of the month.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=Sacred Heart Church, Limerick|url=http://institute-christ-king.ie|website=Institute of Christ the King|accessdate=7 February 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; The Institute is closely involved in the annual Catholic Voice conference held in Limerick which features amongst its regular speakers [[Raymond Leo Burke|Cardinal Burke]] and Fr. John Hunwicke.

In addition to its oratories in the United States and missions in Africa, the institute also has apostolates in [[France]], [[Spain]], [[Belgium]], [[Italy]], [[Germany]], [[Austria]], and [[Switzerland]]. The institute is especially active in the domain of education, running schools in France (Montpellier, Lille and Versailles), Belgium (Brussels International Catholic School), and Africa.

During its yearly ordinations week in Italy, the institute has had visits by the Cardinals [[Raymond Leo Burke]], [[Antonio Cañizares Llovera]], [[Darío Castrillón Hoyos]], Giuseppe Siri and Archbishop Camille Perl.

==Sisters Adorers of the Royal Heart of Jesus==
The [[Adorers of the Royal Heart of Jesus Christ Sovereign Priest]] are a women's community (founded in 2004) associated with the institute. They are also based in Gricigliano. The sisters are non-cloistered [[Contemplation|contemplatives]], and their way of life is based on the [[Benedictine]] tradition. The community celebrates [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]] and the [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]] using the traditional [[Roman Rite]]. When the number of sisters has increased sufficiently, the community plans to locate convents near the institute's churches, where the sisters will perform apostolic work such as teaching. {{As of|2016}}, the sisters numbered about thirty.&lt;ref name=Institute&gt;[http://religiouslife.com/profile-view?id=341 "Institute of Christ the King Sovereign Priest", Institute of Religious Life]&lt;/ref&gt; The sisters have established a presence in Germany.&lt;ref name=Lueking/&gt;

Mass and the Divine Office celebrated in the classical Roman form, form the rhythm of each day. Needlework and embroidery projects form an important part of their daily "''Ora et Labora''" ("pray and work").

==Society of the Sacred Heart==
The Society of the Sacred Heart is a lay society associated with the Institute of Christ the King. The lay members of the society pledge to live according to a modified Benedictine rule, within their vocation. Through membership in the society, lay faithful participate in the spiritual and social missions of the institute through prayer, devotions, spiritual direction, and study of the spiritual writings of St. Francis de Sales. 

==Superiors==
[[Gilles Wach]] is the founder and prior general. 

Philippe Mora is the co-founder and rector of the international St. Philip Neri seminary in Gricigliano.

R. Michael Schmitz is the vicar general of the institute and provincial of France.

== History ==

=== Atheism in the Russian Empire ===

==== 18th century ====
[[File: Voltaire 1769.jpg | thumb|right | 270px | Voltaire. 1769 year]]
In the Russian Empire, the atheistic worldview began to permeate in connection with the growing popularity of the ideas of [[Voltaire]] in the mid-18th century,{{sfn | Voronitsyn | 1933 | loc = M. | p = 175 }} but the number of radical atheists was still insignificant.{{sfn | Voronitsyn | 1933 | loc = M. | p = 186-187 }} Most of the supporters of this trend adhered to [[Deism|Deismistic views]], since, according to the Russian historian [[Vladimir Nikolaevich]], "Russian society in the mass understood deism as the absence of God".{{sfn | Voronitsyn | 1933 | loc = M. | p = 186 }}

The future Empress [[Catherine II]] as early as the 1740s and 1750s became acquainted with Voltaire's original works, which practically did not contain the propaganda of materialism and atheism, to which he had just begun to join at that time, but afterwards her interest in them faded away.{{sfn | Voronitsyn | 1933 | loc = M. | p = 189 }} Along with this, being a Voltairean,{{sfn | Voronitsyn | 1933 | loc = M. | p = 188 }}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Kryuchkova MA part = | link part = | title = Memoirs of Catherine II and their time  | url = | wikisource = | responsible = | edition = | place = M. | publisher= Summer garden | year = 2009 | volume = | pages = 364, 461 | series = | isbn = | print = | ref =}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Trachevsky AI | part = | link part = | title = Russian history  | url = | wikisource = | responsible = | publication = | place = | publisher=K. L. Rikker | year = 1895 | volume = II | pages = 316, 642 | series = | isbn = | circulation = | ref =}}&lt;/ref&gt; Catherine was carried away by reading and analyzing the "Historical and Critical Dictionary "atheist.{{sfn | Tazhurizina | 1979 |loc = 185}}&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Levine, Alan | link part = | title = Early Modern Skepticism and the Origins of Toleration; Pierre Bayle's atheist politics   | url = | wikisource = | responsible = | place = |publisher= Lexington Books | year = 1999 | volume = | pages = 197 &lt;!-- | columns = | allpages = 282 --&gt; | series = | isbn = | edition = | ref =}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Pierre Bayle]], from which the principle of toleration, embodied during all her reign, was derived. In 1767, Catherine made an attempt to reform the [[Russian Orthodox Church]], subject to the following amendments to the [[Holy Synod]]: to allow [[Old Believers]] in the post to use a number of dishes, as well as shorten the duration of [[Post (religion)|posts]]; on top of that, she worked to remove from the houses of the icon, eliminate a number of Christian holidays, replace the lengthy services with short, evening and [[all-night vigil]] - with brief prayers with instruction, allow bishops to have a wife, change the form of clergymen to a more Secular variety, eliminate some difficulties about the need for divorce, to allow marriages between relatives and representatives of different faiths and finally to liquidate the commemoration of the deceased and so on.{{sfn | Voronitsyn | 1933 | loc = M. | p = 193 }}

Members of the Synod ignored these amendments, realizing that as a result of their implementation, the authority of the empress and the church will be significantly undermined. After the death of Voltaire, the empress ordered 100 complete collections of works by the thinker so that "they serve as a teaching that they will be studied, confirmed by heart so that the minds will eat them," and even planned to erect a monument to the philosopher in [[St Petersburg]] [[Great French Revolution]] Voltaire's busts, standing in the living rooms and corridors [[Winter Palace]], were demolished, the publication of his writings is prohibited, the available copies were confiscated.

As a result of these events, Catherine II was fully introduced to Orthodoxy as a religion capable of destroying "atheism, pagan, immoral, anarchic, villainous, diabolical, hostile to God and the apostles".

For a certain period of time, among the courtiers of the Russian Empire, the Empress was popular with jokes about religion, the demonstration of godlessness and the exaltation of Voltaire as a philosopher who came to the world in order to free him from superstition.{{sfn|Вороницын|1933|loc=М.|p=194}}

Voltaire himself, referring to the state of religion in the [[Russian Empire]], said: "... the whole yard of the Russian Empire ... consists of deists, despite all the superstitions with which the Greek church is still permeated." The doctrine was successful not only among representatives of the higher class, like the princess [[Yekaterina Vorontsova-Dashkova]],&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book | author = Vorontsov-Dashkov AI | part = | link part = | title = Ekaterina Dashkova: life in power and in disgrace| wikisource = | responsible = | edition = | place = M. | publisher = Young Guard | year = 2010 | volume = | pages = 220, 333 | series =  The life of wonderful People | isbn = 978-5-235-03295-8 | print = | ref =}}&lt;/ref&gt;{{sfn|Вороницын|1933|loc=М.|p=194}} князь [[Alexander Michailowitsch Belosselski]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://rhga.ru/science/conferences/rusm/stenogramms/litera_b.php|title="РУССКАЯ МЫСЛЬ": Историко-методологический семинар в РХГА|subtitle=|author=Ермичев А.

However, with regard to the views of the empress and her supporters, a number of people from both the middle and upper classes expressed dissatisfaction, including the prince [[Mikhail Shcherbatov]] ("[[Catherine]]" ... is enamored with the meaningless reading of new writers, the Christian law, although she piously pretends to be pious, and for nothing reveres. "Although she does not hide her thoughts, but many times in her conversations open" Famous writer [[Denis Fonvizin]] ("..." I entered into close service with one prince, a young writer, and entered a society, to which I can not remember until now without fear.

For it was better to pass the time in blasphemy and blasphemy. In the first I did not take any part and shuddered, hearing the curse of atheists; And I played the blasphemous role in blasphemy myself ... At that time I composed a message to Shumilov, in which some of the poems reveal my misconception at the time, so I have been called an atheist by many people. "

The number of Russian atheists of that time included a large part of [[Freemasonry|Masons]], later disillusioned at godlessness and converted to Orthodoxy.&lt;ref group = "comm."&gt;Including the most prominent masons of the Russian Empire [[Elagin, Ivan Perfilyevich|P.

==20th Century==
In [[Soviet Union]], [[state atheism]] was an essential part of the state ideology.{{Sfn |Glagolev, Evdokimov |1970}} In [[Constitution of Russia]] (and subsequently in [[USSR Constitution]], along with freedom of religion was also for the first time in the world.&lt;ref&gt;[http://state.rin.ru/cgi-Bin/main.pl?Id=77&amp;r=29 Typology of states in relation to religion]&lt;/ref&gt; Freedom is fixed anti-religious propaganda struggle against religion was the task of a number of public organizations ([[League of Militant Atheists]] (1925-1947), society [[Knowledge (Society)|"Knowledge"]] (since 1947)). As a rule, anti-religious propaganda was conducted in parallel with [[popularization of science|popularization of scientific knowledge]]. In 1964 y was established [[Institute of Scientific Atheism]], existed before 1991.

=== Number of atheists ===
Estimates of the number of atheists vary greatly due to the different interpretation of the concept of "atheism."

According to the sociological survey conducted in August 2012 a, [[non-religious]] and atheists themselves were called by 12.9% of Russians.&lt;ref&gt;Olga Filina (Ogonek Magazine).''[http://indrus.in/articles/2012/09/01/mapping_russias_religious_landscape_17333.html Mapping Russia’s Religious Landscape]''. Russia and India Report. ''Retrieved 24-09-2012''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Ogonek"&gt;''[http://www.kommersant.ru/doc/1997068 Верю — не верю]''. «[[Огонёк]]», № 34 (5243), 27/08/2012. ''Retrieved 24-09-2012''.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://sreda.org/arena Арена (Атлас религий и национальностей России)] // Исследовательская служба Среда&lt;/ref&gt;

In a study [[Levada Center]] in November 2012, 5% of respondents named themselves atheists, 10% said they did not belong to any religion.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.levada.ru/17-12-2012/v-rossii-74-pravoslavnykh-i-7-musulman В России 74 % православных и 7 % мусульман] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20150503185105/http://www.levada.ru/17-12-2012/v-rossii-74-pravoslavnykh-i-7-musulman |date=2015-05-03 }} // [[Левада-Центр]], 17.12.2012&lt;/ref&gt;

According to [[Public Opinion Foundation|FOM]] as of June 2013, 25% of Russians do not consider themselves to be believers.&lt;ref&gt;[http://fom.ru/obshchestvo/10953 Ценности: религиозность] // [[ФОМ]], 14.06.2013&lt;/ref&gt;

In the framework of the study "Arena: Atlas of Religions and Nationalities", conducted by the Environment Service in 2012, 13% of Russians stated that they do not believe in God.&lt;ref name = autogenerated1&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://sreda.org/Arena?Mapcode=code13114 |title=Arena: Atlas of religions and nationalities. Atheism | author = | date = 2012 | publisher = Research Service Wednesday |accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

According to the data of all-Russian surveys, atheists prefer to live in another country more often than average and are more likely to be men, and most atheists in Primorsky Territory (35%), Altai Territory (27%), Yakutia (26%), Novosibirsk Region (25%), and the Amur Region (24%).&lt;ref name=autogenerated1 /&gt;

==== Interesting facts ====
In a 2005 interview, [[Andrey Kuraev]] said:

&lt;blockquote&gt;
I have already said that there are almost no atheists in Russia. Atheist today should be entered in [[Red Book of Endangered Species|Red Book]] as a creature worthy of care and protection.&lt;...&gt;in reality there is the most mass religion of our time - [[occultism]]. And if you talk with a person who claims that he is not Orthodox or Muslim, that he does not believe in God, then it turns out - in most cases, some beliefs and even religious practice in his life are present. Let it be an interest in horoscopes, an appeal to healers. Such domestic low magical religiosity is omnipresent. And so people who lived their lives not only without looking at the Bible or the Koran, but without taking into account popular magic television programs and advice, including astrological ones, are extremely few.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.patriarchia.ru/db/text/60215.html |title=Диакон Андрей Кураев: "Атеизм как таковой — это просто отрицание чужой святыни" |publisher=[[Patriarchia.ru]] |date=25 November 2005 |accessdate=8 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;!--{{конец цитаты}} --&gt;
&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==The rights of atheists in Russia==

'' [[The Constitution of the Russian Federation]] "establishes the secular character of the state." No religion can be established as '' 'public or mandatory' '' (Article 14). Article 19 of the Constitution establishes the equality of religious associations before the law and their separation from the state. Article 28 guarantees freedom of religion - the right to confess individually or in community with others to any religion, "or not to profess any", "freely choose," "have and distribute" religious and other Beliefs "and act in accordance with them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.constitution.ru|title=Конституция Российской Федерации|website=Constitution.ru|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Law "On Education" establishes the secular nature of public education. The creation and operation of organizational structures [ of [[political parties]] and religious organizations (associations) in state and [[municipalities]] educational institutions are not allowed&lt;ref name=edu&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.consultant.ru/cons/cgi/online.cgi?req=doc;base=LAW;n=201339|title=Закон "Об образовании"|publisher=|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt; 
Pedagogical workers can not, in the framework of educational activity, compel students to accept political, religious or other beliefs or refuse them. The law "On Freedom of Conscience and Religious Associations" establishes the right of every citizen to profess individually or jointly with others any religion or not to profess any, freely choose and change, have and disseminate religious and other beliefs and act In accordance with them, if this does not contradict the need to protect the rights and legitimate interests of citizens and the security of the state. Discrimination on religious grounds is not allowed. Nobody is obliged to report their attitude to religion and can not be forced to participate or not to participate in religious activities. It is prohibited to involve [[Age of majority]] in religious associations, as well as the education of juvenile religions contrary to their will and without the consent of [[Kinship]] or their substitutes.&lt;ref name=svosov&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.pravbeseda.ru/library/index.php?page=book&amp;id=571|title=Закон о свободе совести и религиозных объединениях|website=Pravbeseda.ru|accessdate=10 August 2017}}&lt;/ref&gt;

He is credited with developing [[Safed]] into an important [[Jewish]] and [[Kabbalah|kabbalistic]] centre.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Fern Andrews|1976|p=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Due to a legend he is known as ''Tzaddik ha-Lavan'' (White Saint) or ''Tzaddik ha-Tarnegolim'' (Cockerel Saint.)

==Biography==
Although Saragossi was born in 15th-century Spain, it is possible that his family did not originate in the Spanish town of [[Saragossa]], as his name implies, but rather Zaragoza ([[Syracuse, Sicily|Syracuse]]) in [[Sicily]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Adler|Schechter|Neuman|1956|p=332}}. Although he has been called "the Sefardi", which indicates Spanish extraction, this may only be a generic term for the exiles of 1492.&lt;/ref&gt; He was banished with the rest of the Jewish community in 1492 and travelled through Sicily to [[Beirut]] and [[Sidon]]. He settled in Safed, where he became a rabbi.&lt;ref name=JE&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/13193-saragossi-joseph Joseph Saragossi] ''Jewish Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt; There were about 300 Jews there who had originally come from the [[Berber people|Berbers]], [[Sephardim]] and [[Moriscos]], but they had no natural leader.&lt;ref name=graetz/&gt;

Saragossi became a rabbi and a leader of the Jewish people despite his quiet manner. His charismatic personality was used to foster the growth of peace and harmony within the community. He endeavored to show reconciliation and mutual respect towards Safed's Muslim and Arab inhabitants.&lt;ref name=graetz/&gt; Saragossi's influence in Safed has been compared to the Italian [[Obadiah ben Abraham Bartenura|Obadyah di Bertinoro]] who made a similar contribution to the community in Jerusalem.&lt;ref name=graetz&gt;{{cite book|last=Graetz|first=Heinrich|title=History of the Jews, Vol. IV (in Six Volumes): From the Rise of the Kabbala p.399|year=2009|page=399|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=dfK5t5TJnoUC&amp;dq=%22joseph+Saragossi%22&amp;source=gbs_navlinks_s|display-authors=etal}}&lt;/ref&gt;

When Saragossi indicated his intention to leave Safed, the people of Safed persuaded him to remain, offering to pay him an annual retainer. The respect of the Arab community was demonstrated when their Muslim governor promised to provide 33 of the 50 [[ducat]]s that was offered to Saragossi as an annual payment.&lt;ref name=JE/&gt;&lt;ref name=graetz/&gt; Combining Talmudic with kabbalistic knowledge, Saragossi created a movement interested in Kabbalistic Jewish study in Safed.&lt;ref name=graetz/&gt; His kabbalistic teachings attracted the attention of [[David ben Solomon ibn Abi Zimra|David ibn Abu Zimra]].&lt;ref name=JE/&gt;

In accordance with his wish, Saragossi was buried adjacent to the tomb of [[Judah bar Ilai]], the site where he experienced a revelation of the prophet [[Elijah]].&lt;ref name="Vilnay 2003 383"&gt;{{harvnb|Vilnay|2003|p=383}}&lt;/ref&gt; The object of a legend in which a salvation was wrought at his graveside involving the procurement of 500 pure white chickens, he was thereafter called the ''Tzaddik ha-Lavan'' (White Saint) or the ''Tzaddik ha-Tarnegolim'' (Cockrel Saint.)&lt;ref name="Vilnay 2003 383"/&gt; At the turn of the 19th-century, Saragossi's tomb at [[Ein Zeitim|'Ain Zaitun]] was the object of a weekly pilgrimage from the morning after Passover (22nd [[Nisan]]) until the 18th [[Iyyar]].&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.jewishencyclopedia.com/articles/12149-pilgrimage Pilgrimage], ''Jewish Encyclopedia''.&lt;/ref&gt;

{{Refimprove|date=July 2009}}
{{SikhBeliefs}}
{{Five Evils}}
'''Kaam'''  (from [[Sanskrit]] ''[[kama]]'') meaning deep extensive desire, uncontrolled longing, concupiscence, sensuality or lasciviousness is counted among the five cardinal sins or sinful propensities in [[Sikhism]].{{CN|date=September 2018}}  In common usage, the term stands for ''excessive passion for [[sexual pleasure]]'' and it is in this sense that it is considered to be an evil in Sikhism.{{CN|date=September 2018}}

In Sikhism it is believed that Kaam can be overcome by being satisfied with the current moment. All 5 thieves can be overcome with [[selfless service]] and remembrance of God ([[Simran]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last=Majupuria|first=Trilok|title=Religions in Nepal: With Reference to Religions of Tibet and India|year=2004|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|title=Sevartham, Volume 31|publisher=St. Albert's College|page=48}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Sikh Guru teachings ==
The [[Gurus]] rejected lust. Yet they recognized the four ''purusarthas'', referred to in [[gurbani]] as char ''[[Padarath]]s'' or the four human pursuits as the Granth Sahib declares "''[[Dharma]], [[Artha]], Kam and [[Moksha]] follow God's devotee like shadow''" (SGGS 1320).  However, in Sikhism, Kam is not unrestricted gratification of carnal desires, but an impulse which needs to be kept under check like other impulses and passions.  Unrestrained propensity towards Kam, especially sexual relationship outside the marital bond, is condemned in the strongest terms in [[Sikh]] codes of conduct as well as in the Scripture.  It is a destructive evil and a deadly sin. Kam is heavily discouraged as it "''can build barriers against God in their lives''".&lt;ref name="bbc.co.uk"&gt;http://www.bbc.co.uk/religion/religions/sikhism/beliefs/beliefs.shtml&lt;/ref&gt;

To quote [[Guru Arjan]], Nanak V: "O Kam, thou landest people in hell and makest them wander through many births, enticest all minds, swayest all the three worlds and undoest one's meditation, austerities and restraint. The pleasure is ephemeral and thou afflictest high and low alike" (GG, 1358).  [[Guru Tegh Bahadur]] Nanak IX, says:  "In the sinning heart reigns kam and the fickle mind breaks out of control.  Kam casts its noose even upon yogis, jangams and sannyasis.  Only those imbued with God's Name (fall not a prey to it) and are able to go across the ocean of existence" (GG, 1186).  [[Bhai Gurdas]] describes an ideal [[Sikh]] as one who is loyal to his wife and "regards all other women as mothers, sisters and daughters" (Varan, XXIX. 11). [[Guru Gobind Singh]] also said: "Love your own wedded wife ever so more, but do not go to another woman's bed even in a dream."  [[Sikh]] codes of conduct strictly prohibit extramarital relations.

While prescribing self-control and restraint and not total annihilation of kam, the [[Gurus]] suggested two ways of channelizing and sublimating it. On the one hand, they pronounced grihastha or married life to be the ideal one, and, on the other laid down love of God and absorption in His Name as the essential principle of spiritual discipline. Says [[Guru Gobind Singh]] "Hear ye all, I proclaim here the truth: only they who love God find Him." The image of a devotee most common in [[Sikh Scripture]] is one of a wife deeply in love with her husband presently separated from him, and waiting, craving, praying for a reunion with him. Such fervent devotion cannot but bridle the wayward passion in man.  According to [[Guru Arjan]], a person who has cultivated the love of the Lord’s feet would desire neither kingship, worldly power, or even mukti or liberation (GG 534).

[[File:Prince Hanzoku terrorised by a nine- tailed fox.jpg|right|thumb|Prince Hanzoku terrorized by the nine-tailed fox ''[[Fox spirit|Kyūbi no Kitsune]]''. Print by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]], 19th century.]]
{{nihongo|'''''Kitsune'''''|[[wiktionary:狐#Japanese|狐]], キツネ|extra={{IPA-ja|kitsɯne|IPA|Ja-Kitsune.oga}}}} is the [[Japanese language|Japanese word]] for the [[Red fox|fox]]. Foxes are a common subject of [[Japanese folklore]]; in English, ''kitsune'' refers to them in this context. Stories depict them as intelligent beings and as possessing [[paranormal]] abilities that increase with their age and wisdom. According to [[Yōkai]] folklore, all foxes have the ability to shapeshift into human form. While some folktales speak of kitsune employing this ability to trick others—as foxes in folklore often do—other stories portray them as faithful guardians, friends, lovers, and wives.

Foxes and humans lived close together in [[History of Japan#Ancient and Classical Japan|ancient Japan]]; this companionship gave rise to legends about the creatures. Kitsune have become closely associated with [[Inari Ōkami|Inari]], a [[Shinto]] ''[[kami]]'' or spirit, and serve as its messengers. This role has reinforced the fox's [[supernatural]] significance. The more tails a kitsune has—they may have as many as nine—the older, wiser, and more powerful it is. Because of their potential power and influence, some people make sacrifices to them as to a deity.

Conversely foxes were often seen as "witch animals", especially during the superstitious Edo period (1603–1867), and were goblins who could not be trusted (similar to some badgers and cats).&lt;ref name=casal&gt;{{cite book|last1=Casal|first1=U.A.|title=The Goblin Fox and Badger and Other Witch Animals of Japan|publisher=Nanzan University Press|pages=1–93}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Origins==
[[File:NineTailsFox.JPG|right|thumb|A nine-tailed fox, from the Qing edition of the ancient text ''[[Classic of Mountains and Seas]]'']]
[[File:Vulpes vulpes laying in snow.jpg|thumb|left|Japan is home to two [[red fox]] [[subspecies]]: the Hokkaido fox (''Vulpes vulpes schrencki'', pictured), and the Japanese red fox (''Vulpes vulpes japonica'').]]
Japanese fox myths had their origins in [[Chinese mythology]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Gubler, Greg|title=Kitsune: The Remarkable Japanese Fox|journal=Southern Folklore Quarterly|volume=38|issue=2|pages=121–134}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Bargen|first1=Doris G.|title=A woman's weapon: spirit possession in the Tale of Genji|date=1997|publisher=University of Hawaii Press|location=Honolulu|isbn=9780824818586|page=292}}&lt;/ref&gt; Chinese folk tales tell of fox spirits called ''[[Huli jing|húli jīng]]'' ({{zh|c=狐狸精}}) that may have up to nine tails (''[[Fox spirit|Kyūbi no Kitsune]]'' in Japanese). Many of the earliest surviving stories are recorded in the ''[[Konjaku Monogatarishū]]'', an 11th-century collection of [[Chinese literature|Chinese]], [[Indian literature|Indian]], and Japanese narratives.&lt;ref name=Goff97&gt;{{cite journal|url=http://faculty.humanities.uci.edu/sbklein/Ghosts/articles/goff-foxes.pdf|author=Goff, Janet|title=Foxes in Japanese culture: beautiful or beastly?|journal=Japan Quarterly|volume=44|issue=2|date=April 1997}}&lt;/ref&gt; The nine-tailed foxes came to be adapted as a motif from Chinese mythology to Japanese mythology.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Wallen|first1=Martin|title=Fox|date=2006|publisher=[[Reaktion Books]]|location=London|isbn=9781861892973|pages=69–70}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Smyers (1999) notes that the idea of the fox as seductress and the connection of the fox myths to [[Buddhism]] were introduced into Japanese folklore through similar Chinese stories, but she maintains that some fox stories contain elements unique to Japan.&lt;ref name="Smyers 1999, pp.127–128"&gt;{{harvnb|Smyers|1999|pages=127–8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Etymology===
The full etymology is unknown. The oldest known usage of the word is in the 794 text ''[[Shin'yaku Kegonkyō Ongi Shiki]]''. Other old sources include [[Nihon Ryōiki]] (810–824) and [[Wamyō Ruijushō]] (c. 934). These oldest sources are written in [[Man'yōgana]] which clearly identifies the [[Jōdai Tokushu Kanazukai|historical spelling]] as ''ki&lt;sub&gt;1&lt;/sub&gt;tune''. Following several diachronic phonological changes, this becomes ''kitsune''.

Many etymological suggestions have been made, though there is no general agreement:
*Myōgoki (1268) suggests that it is so called because it is "always (''tsune'') yellow (''ki'')".
*Early [[Kamakura period]] [[Mizukagami]] indicates that it means "came (''ki'') [ [[perfective aspect]] particle ''tsu''] to bedroom (''ne'')" due to a legend that a kitsune would change into one's wife and bear children.
*[[Arai Hakuseki]] in Tōga (1717) suggests that ''ki'' means "stench", ''tsu'' is a possessive particle, and ''ne'' is related to ''inu'', the word for "dog".
*Tanikawa Kotosuga in Wakun no Shiori (1777–1887) suggests that ''ki'' means "yellow", ''tsu'' is a possessive particle, and ''ne'' is related to ''neko'', the word for cat.
*[[Ōtsuki Fumihiko]] in Daigenkai (1932–1935) proposes that the word comes from ''kitsu'', which is [[onomatopoeia]] for the bark of a fox, and ''ne'', which may be an affix or an honorific word meaning a servant of an [[Inari shrine]].
* Nozaki also suggests that the word ''kitsune'' was originally [[onomatopoeia|onomatopoetic]]. ''Kitsu'' represented a fox's yelp and came to be the general word for ''fox''. ''-Ne'' signifies an affectionate mood.&lt;ref name="Nozaki3"&gt;{{harvnb|Nozaki|1961|page=3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

''Kitsu'' is now archaic; in modern Japanese, a fox's cry is transcribed as ''kon kon'' or ''gon gon''.

One of the oldest surviving kitsune tales provides a widely known [[folk etymology]] of the word ''kitsune''.&lt;ref name="Hamel 2003, p.89"&gt;{{harvnb|Hamel|2003|page=89}}&lt;/ref&gt; Unlike most tales of kitsune who become human and marry human males, this one does not end tragically:&lt;ref name=Goff97/&gt;&lt;ref name="Smyers 1999, p.72"&gt;{{harvnb|Smyers|1999|page=72}}&lt;/ref&gt;

::Ono, an inhabitant of Mino (says an ancient Japanese legend of A.D. 545), spent the seasons longing for his ideal of female beauty. He met her one evening on a vast moor and married her.  Simultaneously with the birth of their son, Ono's dog was delivered of a pup which as it grew up became more and more hostile to the lady of the moors. She begged her husband to kill it, but he refused.  At last one day the dog attacked her so furiously that she lost courage, resumed vulpine shape, leaped over a fence and fled.

::"You may be a fox," Ono called after her, "but you are the mother of my son and I will always love you.  Come back when you please; you will always be welcome."

::So every evening she stole back and slept in his arms.&lt;ref name="Hamel 2003, p.89"/&gt;

Because the fox returns to her husband each night as a woman but leaves each morning as a fox she is called Kitsune. In classical Japanese, ''kitsu-ne'' means ''come and sleep'', and ''ki-tsune'' means ''always comes''.&lt;ref name="Smyers 1999, p.72"/&gt;

==Characteristics==

Kitsune are believed to possess superior intelligence, long life, and magical powers. They are a type of ''[[yōkai]]''; the word ''kitsune'' is often translated as ''[[fox spirit]]''. However, this does not mean that kitsune are [[ghost]]s, nor that they are fundamentally different from regular foxes. Because the word ''spirit'' is used to reflect a state of knowledge or enlightenment, all long-lived foxes gain supernatural abilities.&lt;ref name="Smyers 1999, pp.127–128"/&gt;

There are two common classifications of kitsune:

* The {{nihongo|''zenko''|善狐-literally ''good foxes''}} are benevolent, celestial foxes associated with [[Inari Ōkami|Inari]]; they are sometimes simply called ''Inari foxes''
* On the other hand, the {{nihongo|''[[yako (fox)|yako]]''|野狐|extra=literally ''field foxes'', also called ''nogitsune''}} tend to be mischievous or even malicious.&lt;ref&gt;''Yōkai no hon'' written by Prof. Abe Masaji &amp; Prof. Ishikawa Junichiro&lt;/ref&gt;

Local traditions add further types.&lt;ref name="Hearn154"&gt;{{harvnb|Hearn|page=154}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a ''ninko'' is an invisible fox spirit that human beings can only perceive when it [[spiritual possession|possesses]] them.

[[File:Obake Karuta 3-01.jpg|left|thumb|This ''[[karuta|obake karuta]]'' (monster card) from the early 19th century depicts a kitsune. The associated game involves matching clues from folklore to pictures of specific creatures.]]
Physically, kitsune are noted for having as many as nine tails.&lt;ref name="Smyers 1999, p.129"&gt;{{harvnb|Smyers|1999|page=129}}&lt;/ref&gt; Generally, a greater number of tails indicates an older and more powerful fox; in fact, some folktales say that a fox will only grow additional tails after it has lived 100 years.&lt;ref name="Hamel 2003, p.91"/&gt; One, five, seven, and nine tails are the most common numbers in folk stories.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://academia.issendai.com/fox-misconceptions.shtml#tails |title=Kitsune, Kumiho, Huli Jing, Fox |accessdate=2006-12-14 |date=2003-04-28}}&lt;/ref&gt; When a kitsune gains its ninth tail, its fur becomes white or gold.&lt;ref name="Smyers 1999, p.129"/&gt; These {{Nihongo|''[[Fox spirit|kyūbi no kitsune]]''|九尾の狐||nine-tailed foxes}} gain the abilities to see and hear anything happening anywhere in the world. Other tales credit them with infinite wisdom ([[omniscience]]).&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hearn|page=159}}&lt;/ref&gt; After reaching 1,000 years of age and gaining its ninth tail, a kitsune turns a golden color, becoming a {{nihongo|'[[Tenko (fox)|Tenko]]'|[[Wiktionary:天狐|天狐]]|"heavenly fox"/"celestial fox"}}, the most powerful form of the kitsune, and then ascends to the heavens.

===Shapeshifting===
[[File:Bertha Boynton Lum, Fox women, 1908.jpg|thumb|"Fox women" by [[Bertha Lum]]: kitsune as women]]
A kitsune may [[shapeshifting|take on human form]], an ability learned when it reaches a certain age—usually 100 years, although some tales say 50.&lt;ref name="Hamel 2003, p.91"&gt;{{harvnb|Hamel|2003|page=91}}&lt;/ref&gt; As a common prerequisite for the transformation, the fox must place reeds, a leaf, or a skull over its head.&lt;ref name="Nozaki2526"&gt;{{harvnb|Nozaki|1961|pages=25–26}}&lt;/ref&gt; Common forms assumed by kitsune include beautiful women, young girls, elderly men, and even young boys.&lt;ref name="民俗学辞典" /&gt; These shapes are not limited by the fox's age or gender,&lt;ref name="Smyers 1999, pp.127–128"/&gt; and a kitsune can [[human disguise|duplicate the appearance of a specific person]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2003|page=145}}&lt;/ref&gt; Foxes are particularly renowned for impersonating beautiful women. Common belief in [[History of Japan#Feudal Japan (1185-1603)|medieval Japan]] was that any woman encountered alone, especially at dusk or night, could be a fox.&lt;ref name="Tyler xlix"&gt;{{harvnb|Tyler|1987|page=xlix}}&lt;/ref&gt; ''Kitsune-gao'' or ''fox-faced'' refers to human females who have a narrow face with close-set eyes, thin eyebrows, and high cheekbones. Traditionally, this facial structure is considered attractive, and some tales ascribe it to foxes in human form.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nozaki|1961|pages=95, 206}}&lt;/ref&gt; Variants on the theme have the kitsune retain other foxlike traits, such as a coating of fine hair, a fox-shaped shadow, or a reflection that shows its true form.&lt;ref name="Hearn155"&gt;{{harvnb|Hearn|page=155}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In some stories, kitsune have difficulty hiding their tails when they take human form; looking for the tail, perhaps when the fox gets drunk or careless, is a common method of discerning the creature's true nature.&lt;ref name="Ashkenazy148"&gt;{{harvnb|Ashkenazy|2003|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; A particularly devout individual may even be able to see through a fox's disguise merely by perceiving them.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Steven |last=Heine |title=Shifting Shape, Shaping Text:  Philosophy and Folklore in the Fox Koan |publisher=University of Hawai'i Press |year=1999 |isbn=978-0-8248-2150-0 |page=153 }}
&lt;/ref&gt; Kitsune can also be exposed while in human form by their fear and hatred of dogs, and some become so rattled by their presence that they revert to the form of a fox and flee.

One folk story illustrating these imperfections in the kitsune's human shape concerns Koan,&lt;!-- See Talk page, § Koan. --&gt; a historical person credited with wisdom and magical powers of [[divination]]. According to the story, he was staying at the home of one of his devotees when he scalded his foot entering a bath because the water had been drawn too hot. Then, "in his pain, he ran out of the bathroom naked. When the people of the household saw him, they were astonished to see that Koan had fur covering much of his body, along with a fox's tail. Then Koan transformed in front of them, becoming an elderly fox and running away."&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2003|page=144}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other supernatural abilities commonly attributed to the kitsune include possession, generating fire or lightning, willful manifestation in the dreams of others, flight, invisibility, and the creation of illusions so elaborate as to be almost indistinguishable from reality.&lt;ref name="Nozaki2526"/&gt;&lt;ref name="Hearn155"/&gt; Some tales speak of kitsune with even greater powers, able to bend time and space, drive people mad, or take fantastic shapes such as an incredibly tall tree or a second moon in the sky.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hearn|pages=156–7}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nozaki|1961|pages=36–37}}&lt;/ref&gt; Other kitsune have characteristics reminiscent of [[vampire]]s or [[succubus|succubi]] and feed on the life or spirit of human beings, generally through sexual contact.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nozaki|1961|page=26, 221}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The legend is the subject of the [[noh]] drama ''[[Sanjō Kokaji]]''.]]

===''Kitsunetsuki''===
[[File:Gyokuzan Kitsunetsuki.jpg|right|thumb|240px|A depiction of a kitsunetsuki in the ''Gyokuzan Gafu'' by [[Okada Gyokuzan]]]]
{{nihongo|''Kitsunetsuki''|狐憑き, 狐付き|lead=yes}}, also written ''kitsune-tsuki'', literally means "the state of being possessed by a fox". The victim is usually a young woman, whom the fox enters beneath her fingernails or through her breasts.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nozaki|1961|page=59}}&lt;/ref&gt; In some cases, the victims' facial expressions are said to change in such a way that they resemble those of a fox. Japanese tradition holds that fox possession can cause illiterate victims to temporarily gain the ability to read.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nozaki|1961|page=216}}&lt;/ref&gt; Though foxes in folklore can possess a person of their own will, kitsunetsuki is often attributed to the malign intents of hereditary [[Witchcraft#Japan|fox employers]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=Carmen  |last=Blacker |title=The Catalpa Bow: A Study of Shamanistic Practices in Japan |publisher=Routledge |year=1999 |isbn=978-1-873410-85-1 |page=52 |url=http://faculty.humanities.uci.edu/sbklein/ghosts/articles/CatalpaBow-WitchAnimals.pdf |format=PDF}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Folklorist [[Lafcadio Hearn]] describes the condition:
{{quote|Strange is the madness of those into whom demon foxes enter.  Sometimes they run naked shouting through the streets. Sometimes they lie down and froth at the mouth, and yelp as a fox yelps.  And on some part of the body of the possessed a moving lump appears under the skin, which seems to have a life of its own.  Prick it with a needle, and it glides instantly to another place.  By no grasp can it be so tightly compressed by a strong hand that it will not slip from under the fingers.  Possessed folk are also said to speak and write languages of which they were totally ignorant prior to possession.  They eat only what foxes are believed to like&amp;nbsp;— [[tofu]], ''[[aburaage|aburagé]]'', ''[[adzuki bean|azuki]]meshi'', etc.&amp;nbsp;— and they eat a great deal, alleging that not they, but the possessing foxes, are hungry.|''Glimpses of Unfamiliar Japan'', vol. 1&lt;ref name="Hearn158"&gt;{{harvnb|Hearn|page=158}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

He goes on to note that, once freed from the possession, the victim will never again be able to eat tofu, ''azukimeshi'', or other foods favored by foxes:
{{quote|[[Exorcism]], often performed at an [[Inari shrine]], may induce a fox to leave its host.&lt;ref name="Smyers 1999, p.90"&gt;{{harvnb|Smyers|1999|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; In the past, when such gentle measures failed or a priest was not available, victims of ''kitsunetsuki'' were beaten or badly burned in hopes of forcing the fox to leave. Entire families were ostracized by their communities after a member of the family was thought to be possessed.&lt;ref name="Hearn158"/&gt;}}

In Japan, kitsunetsuki was noted as a disease as early as the [[Heian period]] and remained a common diagnosis for [[mental illness]] until the early 20th century.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nozaki|1961|page=211}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hearn|page=165}}&lt;/ref&gt; Possession was the explanation for the abnormal behavior displayed by the afflicted individuals. In the late 19th century, Dr. Shunichi Shimamura noted that physical diseases that caused fever were often considered kitsunetsuki.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nozaki|1961|pages=214–5}}&lt;/ref&gt; The belief has lost favor, but stories of fox possession still occur, such as allegations that members of the [[Aum Shinrikyo]] cult had been possessed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Miyake-Downey, Jean |title=Ten Thousand Things |url=http://www.kyotojournal.org/10,000things/039.html |journal=Kyoto Journal |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20080406161331/http://www.kyotojournal.org/10%2C000things/039.html |archivedate=April  6, 2008 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In medicine, kitsunetsuki is a [[culture-bound syndrome]] unique to [[Culture of Japan|Japanese culture]]. Those who suffer from the condition believe they are possessed by a fox.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |first=William A. |last=Haviland |title=Cultural Anthropology |edition=10th |publisher=Wadsworth |year=2002 |isbn=978-0155085503 |pages=144–5 |url=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Symptoms include cravings for rice or sweet adzuki beans, listlessness, restlessness, and aversion to eye contact. Kitsunetsuki is similar to but distinct from [[clinical lycanthropy]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Yonebayashi, T. |title=Kitsunetsuki (Possession by Foxes)|journal=Transcultural Psychiatry|volume=1 |issue=2|year=1964|pages=95–97|doi=10.1177/136346156400100206}}&lt;/ref&gt;

====Folk beliefs====
In [[folk religion]], stories of fox possession can be found in all lands of Japan. Those possessed by a fox are thought to suffer from a [[mental illness]]-like condition.&lt;ref name="民間信仰"&gt;{{Cite book|author=[[宮本袈裟雄]]他|editor=[[桜井徳太郎]]編|title=民間信仰辞典|year=1980|publisher=[[東京堂出版]]|isbn=978-4-490-10137-9|pages=97–98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

There are families that tell of protective fox spirits, and in certain regions, possession by a [[kuda-gitsune]],&lt;ref name="民俗学辞典"&gt;{{Cite book |editor=民俗学研究所編 |title=民俗学辞典 |year=1951 |publisher=[[東京堂]] |id= ncid BN01703544 |pages=137–8}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[osaki]],&lt;ref name="民俗学辞典" /&gt;&lt;ref name="昔話事典"&gt;{{Cite book|author=佐藤米司他 |editor=[[稲田浩二]]他編 |title= 日本昔話事典 |year=1977 |publisher= [[弘文堂]]|isbn=978-4-335-95002-5|pages=250–1}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[yako (fox)|yako]],&lt;ref name="民間信仰" /&gt; and [[hitogitsune]] are also called "kitsunetsuki."&lt;ref name="民間信仰" /&gt;&lt;ref name="昔話事典" /&gt; These families are said to have been able to use their fox to gain fortune, but marriage into such a family was considered forbidden as it would enlarge the family.&lt;ref name="民間信仰" /&gt; They are also said to be able to bring about illness and curse the possessions, crops, and livestock of ones that they hate, and as a result of being considered taboo by the other families, it has led to societal problems.&lt;ref name="昔話事典" /&gt;

The great amount of faith given to foxes can be seen in how, as a result of the Inari belief where foxes were believed to be [[Inari Ōkami|Inari no Kami]] or its servant, they were employed in practices of [[Dakini#In_Japanese_Buddhism|dakini-ten]] by [[mikkyō]] practitioners and shugendō practitioners and in the oracles of miko and other practitioners, and the customs related to kitsunetsuki can be seen as having developed in such a religious background.&lt;ref name="民間信仰" /&gt;

===''Hoshi no tama''===
[[File:Hiroshige-100-views-of-edo-fox-fires.jpg|right|thumb|"[[Kitsunebi]] on New Year's Night under the Enoki Tree near Ōji" in the [[One Hundred Famous Views of Edo]] by Hiroshige. Each fox has a kitsunebi floating close to their face.]]
Depictions of kitsune or their possessed victims may feature round white balls known as {{Nihongo|''hoshi no tama''|ほしのたま||star balls}}. Tales describe these as glowing with [[kitsunebi]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nozaki|1961|page=183}}&lt;/ref&gt; Some stories identify them as magical jewels or pearls.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nozaki|1961|pages=169–170}}&lt;/ref&gt; When not in human form or possessing a human, a kitsune keeps the ball in its mouth or carries it on its tail.&lt;ref name="Hamel 2003, p.91"/&gt; Jewels are a common symbol of Inari, and representations of sacred Inari foxes without them are rare.&lt;ref name="Smyers 1999, pp.112–114"&gt;{{harvnb|Smyers|1999|pages=112–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

One belief is that when a ''kitsune'' changes shape, its ''hoshi no tama'' holds a portion of its magical power. Another tradition is that the pearl represents the kitsune's soul; the kitsune will die if separated from it for long. Those who obtain the ball may be able to extract a promise from the ''kitsune'' to help them in exchange for its return.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2003|page=149}}&lt;/ref&gt; For example, a 12th-century tale describes a man using a fox's ''hoshi no tama'' to secure a favor:

&lt;blockquote&gt;"Confound you!" snapped the fox. "Give me back my ball!" The man ignored its pleas till finally it said tearfully, "All right, you've got the ball, but you don't know how to keep it. It won't be any good to you. For me, it's a terrible loss. I tell you, if you don't give it back, I'll be your enemy forever. If you ''do'' give it back though, I'll stick to you like a protector god."&lt;/blockquote&gt;

The fox later saves his life by leading him past a band of armed robbers.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tyler|1987|pages=299–300}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Portrayal==

[[File:A man confronted with an apparition of the Fox goddess.jpg|left|thumb|Inari Ōkami appears to a warrior accompanied by a kitsune. This portrayal shows the influence of [[Dakini]]ten concepts from Buddhism. Print by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]].]]
Embedded in Japanese folklore as they are, kitsune appear in numerous Japanese works. [[Noh]], [[kyogen]], [[bunraku]], and [[kabuki]] plays derived from folk tales feature them,&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hearn|pages=162–3}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nozaki|1961|pages=109–124}}&lt;/ref&gt; as do contemporary works such as [[anime]], [[manga]] and [[video game]]s. Japanese metal idol band [[Babymetal]] refer to the kitsune myth in their lyrics and include the use of fox masks, hand signs, and animation interludes during live shows.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://metalhammer.teamrock.com/features/2015-07-21/the-future-is-now-it-s-metal-hammer-273|title=Metal Hammer UK issue 273|publisher = Metal Hammer|accessdate=2015-08-14|date=2015-07-21}}&lt;/ref&gt; Western authors of fiction have also made use of the kitsune legends.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|author=Johnson, Kij |title=The Fox Woman|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=Z0S6-KNcd6wC|date=2001|publisher=Tom Doherty |isbn=978-0-312-87559-6}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Mercedes Lackey |last=Lackey |first=Mercedes |last2=Edghill |first2=Rosemary |title=Spirits White as Lightning|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=ispqCirVSvQC&amp;pg=PT91 |date=2001|publisher=Baen Books|isbn=978-0-671-31853-6|pages=91–}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|last1=Highbridge|first1=Dianne|title=In the Empire of Dreams|date=1999|publisher=Soho Press|location=New York|isbn=978-1-56947-146-3}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Servants of Inari===
[[File:Yoshitoshi - 100 Aspects of the Moon - 91.jpg|thumb|The moon on Musashi Plain (fox) by [[Yoshitoshi]]&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |first=Tsukioka |last=Yoshitori |title=from the series ''One hundred aspects of the moon'' |publisher=National Gallery of Victoria, Australia |url=http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/ngvschools/FloatingWorld/supernatural/The-moon-on-Musashi-Plain/ |access-date=2016-04-25 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20160826233420/http://www.ngv.vic.gov.au/ngvschools/FloatingWorld/supernatural/The-moon-on-Musashi-Plain/ |archive-date=2016-08-26 |dead-url=yes |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;]]
Kitsune are associated with Inari, the [[Shinto]] deity of rice.&lt;ref name="Smyers 1999, p.76"&gt;{{harvnb|Smyers|1999|page=76}}&lt;/ref&gt; This association has reinforced the fox's supernatural significance.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hearn|page=153}}&lt;/ref&gt; Originally, kitsune were Inari's messengers, but the line between the two is now blurred so that Inari Ōkami may be depicted as a fox. Likewise, entire shrines are dedicated to kitsune, where devotees can leave [[Offering (Buddhism)|offering]]s.&lt;ref name="Hearn154"/&gt; Fox spirits are said to be particularly fond of a fried sliced tofu called ''[[aburage]]'', which is accordingly found in the noodle-based dishes kitsune [[udon]] and kitsune [[soba]]. Similarly, ''Inari-zushi'' is a type of [[sushi]] named for Inari Ōkami that consists of rice-filled pouches of fried tofu.&lt;ref name="Smyers 1999, p.96"&gt;{{harvnb|Smyers|1999|page=96}}&lt;/ref&gt; There is speculation among folklorists as to whether another Shinto fox deity existed in the past. Foxes have long been worshipped as ''kami''.&lt;ref name="Smyers 1999, p.77, 81"&gt;{{harvnb|Smyers|1999|pages=77, 81}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Inari's kitsune are white, a color of good [[omen]].&lt;ref name="Hearn154"/&gt; They possess the power to ward off evil, and they sometimes serve as guardian spirits. In addition to protecting Inari shrines, they are petitioned to intervene on behalf of the locals and particularly to aid against troublesome ''nogitsune'', those spirit foxes who do not serve Inari. Black foxes and nine-tailed foxes are likewise considered good omens.&lt;ref name="Ashkenazy148"/&gt;

According to beliefs derived from ''fusui'' (''[[feng shui]]''), the fox's power over evil is such that a mere statue of a fox can dispel the evil ''[[qi|kimon]]'', or energy, that flows from the northeast. Many Inari shrines, such as the famous [[Fushimi Inari]] shrine in [[Kyoto]], feature such statues, sometimes large numbers of them.

Kitsune are connected to the Buddhist religion through the [[Dakini]]ten, goddesses conflated with Inari's female aspect. Dakiniten is depicted as a female [[boddhisattva]] wielding a sword and riding a flying white fox.&lt;ref name="Smyers 1999, pp.82–85"&gt;{{harvnb|Smyers|1999|pages=82–85}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Tricksters===
[[File:Fushimi Inari mini torii.jpg|right|thumb|The [[Fushimi Inari]] shrine in [[Kyoto, Japan|Kyoto]] features numerous kitsune statues.]]
Kitsune are often presented as [[trickster]]s, with motives that vary from mischief to malevolence. Stories tell of kitsune playing tricks on overly proud [[samurai]], greedy merchants, and boastful commoners, while the crueler ones abuse poor tradesmen and farmers or devout Buddhist monks. Their victims are usually men; women are possessed instead.&lt;ref name="Tyler xlix"/&gt; For example, kitsune are thought to employ their [[kitsunebi]] to lead travelers astray in the manner of a [[will o' the wisp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Addiss|1985|page=137}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2003|page=142}}&lt;/ref&gt; Another tactic is for the kitsune to confuse its target with illusions or visions.&lt;ref name="Tyler xlix"/&gt; Other common goals of trickster kitsune include seduction, theft of food, humiliation of the prideful, or vengeance for a perceived slight.

A traditional game called ''kitsune-ken'' (''fox-fist'') references the kitsune's powers over human beings. The game is similar to [[rock-paper-scissors|rock, paper, scissors]], but the three hand positions signify a fox, a hunter, and a village headman. The headman beats the hunter, whom he outranks; the hunter beats the fox, whom he shoots; the fox beats the headman, whom he bewitches.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nozaki|1961|page=230}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Smyers 1999, p.98"&gt;{{harvnb|Smyers|1999|pages=98}}&lt;/ref&gt;

This ambiguous portrayal, coupled with their reputation for vengefulness, leads people to try to discover a troublesome fox's motives. In one case, the 16th-century leader [[Toyotomi Hideyoshi]] wrote a letter to the ''kami'' Inari:

{{quote|To Inari Daimyojin,

My lord, I have the honor to inform you that one of the foxes under your jurisdiction has bewitched one of my servants, causing her and others a great deal of trouble.  I have to request that you make minute inquiries into the matter, and endeavor to find out the reason of your subject misbehaving in this way, and let me know the result.

If it turns out that the fox has no adequate reason to give for his behavior, you are to arrest and punish him at once.  If you hesitate to take action in this matter I shall issue orders for the destruction of every fox in the land.  Any other particulars that you may wish to be informed of in reference to what has occurred, you can learn from the high priest of [[Yoshida Shintō|Yoshida]].&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2003|page=137}} the Yoshida priest in question was Yoshida Kanemi (1535–1610), then head priest at the [[Yoshida Shrine]] in Kyoto.&lt;/ref&gt;}}

[[File:Tamamo-no-mae-woodblock.jpg|right|thumb|[[Tamamo-no-Mae]], a legendary kitsune featured in [[noh]] and [[kyogen]] plays. Print by [[Yoshitoshi]].]]

Kitsune keep their promises and strive to repay any favor. Occasionally a kitsune attaches itself to a person or household, where they can cause all sorts of mischief. In one story from the 12th century, only the homeowner's threat to exterminate the foxes convinces them to behave. The kitsune patriarch appears in the man's dreams:
{{quote|My father lived here before me, sir, and by now I have many children and grandchildren. They get into a lot of mischief, I'm afraid, and I'm always after them to stop, but they never listen. And now, sir, you're understandably fed up with us. I gather that you're going to kill us all. But I just want you to know, sir, how sorry I am that this is our last night of life. Won't you pardon us, one more time? If we ever make trouble again, then of course you must act as you think best. But the young ones, sir&amp;nbsp;— I'm ''sure'' they'll understand when I explain to them why you're so upset. We'll do everything we can to protect you from now on, if only you'll forgive us, and we'll be sure to let you know when anything good is going to happen!"&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tyler|1987|pages=114–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;}}

Other kitsune use their magic for the benefit of their companion or hosts as long as the human beings treat them with respect. As ''[[yōkai]]'', however, kitsune do not share human morality, and a kitsune who has adopted a house in this manner may, for example, bring its host money or items that it has stolen from the neighbors. Accordingly, common households thought to harbor kitsune are treated with suspicion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hearn|pages=159–161}}&lt;/ref&gt; Oddly, samurai families were often reputed to share similar arrangements with kitsune, but these foxes were considered ''zenko'' and the use of their magic a sign of prestige.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hall|2003|page=148}}&lt;/ref&gt; Abandoned homes were common haunts for kitsune.&lt;ref name="Tyler xlix"/&gt; One 12th-century story tells of a minister moving into an old mansion only to discover a family of foxes living there. They first try to scare him away, then claim that the house "has been ours for many years, and ... we wish to register a vigorous protest." The man refuses, and the foxes resign themselves to moving to an abandoned lot nearby.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Tyler|1987|pages=122–4}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Tales distinguish kitsune gifts from kitsune payments. If a kitsune offers a payment or reward that includes money or material wealth, part or all of the sum will consist of old paper, leaves, twigs, stones, or similar valueless items under a magical illusion.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Nozaki|1961|page=195}}&lt;/ref&gt; True kitsune gifts are usually intangibles, such as protection, knowledge, or long life.&lt;ref name="Smyers 1999, pp.103–105"&gt;{{harvnb|Smyers|1999|pages=103–5}}&lt;/ref&gt;

[[File:Kuniyoshi Kuzunoha.jpg|left|thumb|The kitsune [[Kuzunoha]] casts a fox's shadow even in human form. Kuzunoha is a popular figure in folklore and the subject of [[kabuki]] plays. Print by [[Utagawa Kuniyoshi]].]]

===Wives and lovers===
Kitsune are commonly portrayed as lovers, usually in stories involving a young human male and a kitsune who takes the form of a human woman.&lt;ref name="Hamel 2003, p.90"&gt;{{harvnb|Hamel|2003|page=90}}&lt;/ref&gt; The kitsune may be a seductress, but these stories are more often romantic in nature.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Hearn|page=157}}&lt;/ref&gt; Typically, the young man unknowingly marries the fox, who proves a devoted wife. The man eventually discovers the fox's true nature, and the fox-wife is forced to leave him. In some cases, the husband wakes as if from a dream, filthy, disoriented, and far from home. He must then return to confront his abandoned family in shame.

Many stories tell of fox-wives bearing children. When such progeny are human, they possess special physical or [[supernatural]] qualities that often pass to their own children.&lt;ref name="Ashkenazy148"/&gt; The [[astrology|astrologer]]-magician [[Abe no Seimei]] was reputed to have inherited such extraordinary powers.&lt;ref name="Ashkenazy"&gt;{{harvnb|Ashkenazy|2003|page=150}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Other stories tell of kitsune marrying one another. Rain falling from a clear sky&amp;nbsp;— a [[sunshower]]&amp;nbsp;— is called ''[[kitsune no yomeiri]]'' or ''the kitsune's wedding'', in reference to a folktale describing a wedding ceremony between the creatures being held during such conditions.&lt;ref&gt;{{harvnb|Addiss|1985|page=132}}&lt;/ref&gt; The event is considered a good omen, but the kitsune will seek revenge on any uninvited guests,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|author=Vaux, Bert|url=http://www.linguistlist.org/issues/9/9-1795.html |title=Sunshower summary|journal=Linguist |volume=9|issue=1795 |date=December 1998}}  A compilation of terms for sun showers from various cultures and languages.&lt;/ref&gt; as is depicted in the 1990 [[Akira Kurosawa]] film ''[[Dreams (1990 film)|Dreams]]''.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite journal|title=The Fox's Wedding|first=Robert|last=Blust|journal=Anthropos|volume=94|issue=4/6|year=1999|pages=487–499|jstor=40465016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Stephen Turnbull, in "Nagashino 1575", relates the tale of the Takeda clan's involvement with a fox-woman. The warlord [[Takeda Shingen]], in 1544, defeated in battle a lesser local warlord named [[Suwa Yorishige]] and drove him to suicide after a "humiliating and spurious" peace conference, after which Shingen forced marriage on Suwa Yorishige's beautiful 14-year-old daughter Lady Koi—Shingen's own niece. Shingen, Turnbull writes, "was so obsessed with the girl that his superstitious followers became alarmed and believed her to be an incarnation of the white fox-spirit of the [[Suwa Taisha|Suwa Shrine]], who had bewitched him in order to gain revenge."  When their son [[Takeda Katsuyori]] proved to be a disastrous leader and led the clan to their devastating defeat at the [[battle of Nagashino]], Turnbull writes, "wise old heads nodded, remembering the unhappy circumstances of his birth and his magical mother".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |authorlink=Stephen Turnbull (historian) |first=Stephen |last=Turnbull |title=Nagashino 1575 |publisher=Osprey |location= |year=2000 |isbn=978-1-84176-250-0 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="2147">'''La Juderia''', ({{lang-lad|'לה ג'ודיריה'}}), was the former [[Jewish Quarter (diaspora)|Jewish quarter]] of the city of [[Rhodes (city)|Rhodes]], [[Greece]]. The quarter was inhabited by [[Sephardic]], [[Ladino language|Ladino]]-speaking Jews.

==History==
Although there has been a Jewish presence of some sort on the island of Rhodes for nearly 2,000 years, the inhabitants of La Juderia did not arrive until the 16th century, after they were [[Expulsion of the Jews from Spain|expelled from Spain]]. The Jews of Rhodes prospered until the persecutions of Italian Fascism began in the 1930s, and at its peak the population of the Jewish quarter was more than 4,000.

==Geography and features==
La Juderia is located in the eastern part of the [[Medieval City of Rhodes|Old City of Rhodes]], near a pier used by cruise ships. It is primarily centered on the Dossiadou Street where the [[Kahal Shalom Synagogue]], the lone remaining Jewish house of worship on the island of the six that once stood, is located, along with the Jewish Museum of Rhodes. Other features in the quarter include the Square of the Martyred Jews, which pays tribute to the Jews of Rhodes who died in the Holocaust, located near the heart of the neighborhood, the [[Alliance Israélite Universelle]] school, the former site of the [[Kahal Grande Synagogue]], and a number of plaques throughout the quarter in  Ladino, [[Hebrew language|Hebrew]] and [[Italian language|Italian]]. Outside the Juderia is the Jewish cemetery of Rhodes, which dates from the 16th century and is one of the best preserved in Europe.

'''Laqlouq''' ({{lang-ar|لقلوق}}), also spelled ''Laklouk'' and also known as '''′Arab Laqlouq''' ({{lang-ar|عرب القلوق}}) is a small mountainous village in mountainous area in the [[Jbeil District]] of [[Mount Lebanon Governorate]], [[Lebanon]]. It is located 69 kilometers northeast of [[Beirut]]. Laqlouq has an average elevation of 1,780 meters above sea level and a total land area of 210 [[hectare]]s. [[Sunni Muslim]]s, in contrast to the majority of Jbeil District's population, which is largely [[Maronites|Maronite Christian]] with a significant [[Shia Muslim]] minority.&lt;ref name="Localiban"&gt;[http://www.localiban.org/article3497.html Laqlouq]. ''Localiban''. Localiban. 2007-04-28.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
Laqlouq was founded in the 18th century by [[Arab]]s who are known today as ''′Arab al-Laqlouq''.&lt;ref name="Localiban"/&gt; Their presence dates back to the era of Emir [[Bashir Shihab II]], who granted the village residents their lands and who vacationed there in the summer months.&lt;ref name="Localiban"/&gt; The original residents are generally poorer than the newer arrivals who immigrated to the village from nearby areas.&lt;ref name="Localiban"/&gt;

[[File:Laqlouq Mountain 2016.jpg|thumb|left|Laqlouq Mountain 2016, photo by Paul Saad.]]

Visitors to Laqlouq in 1957 reported having a disturbed night whilst camping near the village due to gunfire and explosions as the district celebrated the release from prison of local land owner Sheikh Georges Beg Yussef. He had been sentenced to life in prison in Cairo for drug smuggling. His release was secured by local politician [[Hamid Beik Frangieh]] who had personally lobbied Egyptian President [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] on Yussef's behalf.&lt;ref&gt;[[Ralph Izzard|Izzard, Ralph and Molly]] (1959) ''Smelling the Breezes. A journey through the High Lebanon.'' The Travel Book Club ( by arrangement with Hodder and Stoughton Ltd.) p. 61&lt;/ref&gt;

Today, most of Laqlouq's working inhabitants are employed in trade in the coastal cities of Beirut or [[Tripoli, Lebanon|Tripoli]], while local livestock owners graze their herds in the coastal rural areas.&lt;ref name="Localiban"/&gt; The village's main economic sector is agriculture, but its harvests are seasonally dependent, namely during the summer and fall, which is why most working residents are employed outside the village during the rest of the year. The main crops are apples, plums and vegetables.&lt;ref name="Localiban"/&gt;

==Local government==
Laqlouq's municipal council consisting of nine members, headed by a chairman, who was Ahmad Khodr as of 2007.&lt;ref name="Localiban"/&gt; It also is administered by a village council, which has three members led by a mayor, who was Hasan Salim as of 2007.&lt;ref name="Localiban"/&gt; The village council of Salim was elected in 1998. With the exception of a locally funded summer school, there are no educational institutions in the village, whose municipal projects have been hindered due to a lack of revenue.&lt;ref name="Localiban"/&gt;

The '''Catholic Church in [[Estonia]]''' (a Baltic former Soviet republic, like Latvia and Lithuania) presently comprises only a pre-diocesan [[Latin rite]] jurisdiction, covering (only) the entire country :
* [[Apostolic Administration of Estonia]], obviously not warranting a national episcopal conference, nor partaking in any more regional assembly then the EU-broad Commissio Episcopatuum Communitatis Europææ (COM.E.C.E.).

There are no Eastern Catholic or other Latin prelatures.

There formally is an [[Apostolic Nunciature]] (papal diplomatic representation, embassy-level) to Estonia, but it's vested (like that to [[Latvia]]) in the Apostolic Nunciature to [[Lithuania]] in its national capital [[Vilnius]].

== Defunct Latin jurisdictions ==
There are no [[titular see]]s. 

&lt;br&gt;None of the following has a current direct successor in Estonia, some (at least canonically) one abroad.

;Suppressed [[Livonia]]n [[prince-bishopric]]s  :
* [[Diocese of Dorpat]]
* [[Diocese of Ösel–Wiek]] (alias Saare-Lääne; also known after successive sees as Leal (Lihula) from 1234, Perona (Vana-Pärnu) from 1251, Hapsal (Haapsalu) from 1279)

;Suppressed non-princely Latin sees :
* [[Diocese of Inflanty]] alias Wenden
* [[Diocese of Leal]]
* [[Diocese of Pärnu]] = Pernau (1251-1263)
* [[Diocese of Reval]]
* [[Diocese of Virumaa]] = Wierland (1220-1227)

'''Lou Kenton''' (1 September 1908 – 17 September 2012) was an English [[Proofreading|proofreader]] who served as a medical courier and ambulance driver with the [[International Brigades|International Brigade]] and was its oldest surviving member at the time of his death.

==Early life==
[[File:Battle-of-Cable-Street-red-plaque.png|thumb|upright|Plaque commemorating the [[Battle of Cable Street]]]]
Kenton was born in [[Stepney]], east London to a Jewish [[Ukraine|Ukrainian]] family who had escaped from [[Anti-Jewish pogroms in the Russian Empire|Tsarist pogroms]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Arthur |first=Max |authorlink=Max Arthur |year=2009 |title=The Real Band of Brothers – First hand accounts from the last British survivors of the Spanish Civil War |place=London |publisher=[[HarperCollins]] |isbn=9780007295098 |chapter=Section 1 – Lou Kenton |page=21}} – reference to Kenton's place and date of birth&lt;/ref&gt; His father died from [[tuberculosis]] when he was young.

Kenton left school aged 14 and started work in a paper factory. There he first encountered [[Antisemitism in the United Kingdom|anti-semitism]], which led him to join the [[Communist Party of Great Britain]] in 1929. He took part in the CPGB's disruption of the [[British Union of Fascists]]' rally at [[Olympia, London|Olympia]] in June 1934 and resistance to the BUF in the [[Battle of Cable Street]] in October 1936.&lt;ref name=Telegraph&gt;{{cite news |url= https://www.telegraph.co.uk/news/obituaries/9556423/Lou-Kenton.html |title=Lou Kenton |newspaper=[[The Daily Telegraph]] |publisher=[[Telegraph Media Group]] |date=20 September 2012 |accessdate=4 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Spain==
Early in 1937 Kenton left Stepney and rode his [[Douglas (motorcycles)|Douglas]] motorcycle to [[Albacete]], where he join the [[International Brigades]] in the [[Spanish Civil War]]. His first wife Lillian, an [[Austria]]n nurse who fled Nazi Germany in 1933, shortly followed him. When he arrived at the International Brigades headquarters in [[Albacete]], he applied to join the International Brigade's Medical Unit. It was from there that he spent nearly two years in action as medical courier on his motorcycle distributing medical supplies to hospitals across the country, and as an ambulance driver on the front lines. He returned to Britain late in 1938 on an 'Aid for Spain' mission to raise money for a new ambulance. By the time he had completed his tour, the [[International Brigades#Disbandment|International Brigades had been disbanded]].

==Later life==
After the International Brigades were withdrawn from Spain, Kenton was hugely depressed.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Baxell |first=Richard |authorlink=Richard Baxell |year=2012 |title=[[Unlikely Warriors: The British in the Spanish Civil War and the Struggle Against Fascism]] |place=London |publisher=[[Aurum Press]] |isbn=9781781312339 |chapter=21, From Spanish War to World War |page=409}} – reference to Kenton's depression following the Republic's defeat&lt;/ref&gt; One of his missions was to repatriate to the Spanish authorities the [[Basque people|Basque]] refugees given asylum in the United Kingdom. It was "the first time I saw the fascist police in their three-cornered hats. All the children were in tears and all of them were hanging on to me as we checked each one and handed them over."&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

[[File:Lidice shall live.jpg|thumb|upright|British "Lidice shall live" poster]]
Kenton then joined the [[Merchant Navy (United Kingdom)|Merchant Navy]] and in the first part of the Second World War served on an [[Antarctic]] [[whaler]], the ''Southern Princess''. He and Lillian were divorced and in 1941 Kenton married his second wife Raffa Ephgrave. He was wounded in [[The Blitz]], spent two years in hospital and then took a factory job.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt; After the [[Lidice]] massacre in [[Czechoslovakia]] in 1942, Kenton joined the British "Lidice Shall Live" organisation. He was an active member for many years and in the 1990s served as its Chairman.

After the Second World War, Kenton joined the Homes for Heroes campaign, which helped [[Squatting in England and Wales#Post World War II|homeless ex-servicemen and their families to squat in unoccupied properties]]. He joined the ''[[Financial Times]]'' as a [[proofreader]], and continued to work there until he was in his 70s.&lt;ref name=Telegraph/&gt;

Kenton remained a devout communist, working tirelessly on trade union organisation, unemployed marches and party activities until 1968 when the [[Prague Spring]] was suppressed by the [[Soviet Union]]. He then joined the [[Labour Party (UK)|Labour Party]] and remained a member for the rest of his life.

===Commemorative potter===
From 1980 Kenton produced commemorative pottery for the trade union movement and for radical causes. His work was commissioned by [[Associated Society of Locomotive Engineers and Firemen]], [[Amicus|Tobacco Workers' Union]], [[Society of Graphical and Allied Trades]], [[Trades Union Congress]], areas of the [[National Union of Mineworkers (Great Britain)|National Union of Mineworkers]], the People's March for Jobs, the [[International Brigades|International Brigade]], [[Greater London Council]] Peace Year, [[Liberty (advocacy group)|National Council for Civil Liberties]], [[Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament]], and the [[Greenham Common]] women's campaign.

Kenton had two children and two granddaughters.

===Spanish passport===
On 26 May 2009 it was announced&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |url= http://www.timesonline.co.uk/tol/news/world/europe/article6360886.ece |last=Haynes |first=Deborah |title=Spanish Civil War volunteers are granted citizenship 70 years on |newspaper=[[The Times]]}}{{subscription required}}&lt;/ref&gt; that seven British pensioners were to be awarded Spanish passports at the Spanish Embassy in London on 9 June 2009.

'''Maria Esperanza Medrano de Bianchini''' (November 22, 1928 – August 7, 2004), also known as [[Servant of God]] Maria Esperanza, was a [[Venezuela]]n [[Mysticism|mystic]], in Barrancas in the State of [[Monagas]] near the [[Orinoco]] River.&lt;ref name="MariaEsperanza.org"&gt;[http://www.mariaesperanza.org/english/maria_esperanza_declared_servant_of_god.html Biography of Maria Esperanza] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20110727064240/http://www.mariaesperanza.org/english/maria_esperanza_declared_servant_of_god.html |date=2011-07-27 }} at MariaEsperanza.org&lt;/ref&gt; 

On January 31, 2010, in the (Catholic) [[St. Francis of Assisi Cathedral (Metuchen, New Jersey)|Cathedral of St Francis of Assisi]] in [[Metuchen, New Jersey]], the case for the [[beatification]] and [[canonization]] of Maria Esperanza was opened by the Bishop [[Paul Bootkoski]] of the [[Diocese of Metuchen]], which act gave her the title Servant of God.&lt;ref name="Pillai2010JAN14"&gt;{{cite news

==Life==
Born on November 22, 1928, in Barrancas, Venezuela, Bianchini was the mother of seven children and grandmother of 20 children.&lt;ref name=catholicreview/&gt;

Believers claim that, while at one point Maria Esperanza considered becoming a nun, it was revealed to her in a vision on October 3, 1954 that her calling was to the married life. It is said that in this vision of [[St. John Bosco]], the saint told her she would first encounter her spouse on November 1, 1955, which she reportedly did.&lt;ref name="Pillai2010JAN14"/&gt; She was particularly devoted to [[St Thérèse of Lisieux]] – the “Little Flower”. Believers hold that, from her youth, she lived a life of virtue and fidelity to God and received the gifts of supernatural knowledge, healing, visions, discernment of spirits, locution, ecstasy, levitation, the odor of sanctity, the [[stigmata]], and the ability to read the hearts of others.&lt;ref name="Smith2009"&gt;{{cite news

Bianchini reportedly first saw an apparition of Mary in 1976, but she became a world-renowned figure after Mary reportedly appeared to her and 150 others at a farm named Finca Betania in Venezuela on March 25, 1984. Mary is said to have appeared under the title “Mary, Virgin and Mother, Reconciler of all Peoples and Nations.” The apparition was deemed valid by Bishop Pio Bello Ricardo of Los Teques, Venezuela, in 1987.&lt;ref name=catholicreview&gt;[http://catholicreview.org/article/life/metuchen-opens-sainthood-cause-for-venezuelan-mystic-who-died-in-us "Metuchen opens sainthood cause for Venezuelan mystic who died in US", The Catholic Review]&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Max Kalish''' (March 1, 1891 – 1945) was American sculptor born in [[Valozhyn]], [[Belarus]], and best known for his sculptures of laborers. 

His Orthodox Jewish family emigrated to Cleveland, Ohio in 1893, when he was two years old.&lt;ref&gt;http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artist/?id=2534&lt;/ref&gt;

He studied with [[Herman Matzen]] at the [[Cleveland School of Art]]; in New York City with [[Herbert Adams (sculptor)|Herbert Adams]] at the National Academy of Design, and in the studios of [[Alexander Stirling Calder]] and [[Isidore Konti]]; and in Paris with [[Paul Wayland Bartlett]] at the Académie Colorossi, and [[Jean Antoine Injalbert]] at the [[École des Beaux-Arts]].&lt;ref&gt;Opitz, Glenn B, editor, ''Mantle Fielding's Dictionary of American Painters, Sculptors &amp; Engravers'', Apollo Book, Poughkeepsie NY, 1986&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="Who"&gt;McGlauflin, Alice Coe, editor, ''Who’s Who in American Art 1938-1939, vol. 2'', The American Federation of Arts, Washington D.C.,  1937&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;http://americanart.si.edu/collections/search/artist/?id=2534&lt;/ref&gt;

His best known work is his 1932 statue of Abraham Lincoln in Cleveland, Ohio.

Washington, D.C. publisher Willard M. Kiplinger commissioned Kalish to create fifty portrait statuettes of prominent figures in World War II era politics, arts and sciences. Kiplinger donated the statuettes to the [[Smithsonian Institution]] in 1944.&lt;ref&gt;[http://siris-artinventories.si.edu/ipac20/ipac.jsp?session=14E616B32D504.1375&amp;profile=ariall&amp;source=~!siartinventories&amp;view=subscriptionsummary&amp;uri=full=3100001~!453060~!36&amp;ri=1&amp;aspect=Browse&amp;menu=search&amp;ipp=20&amp;spp=20&amp;staffonly=&amp;term=Kalish,+Max,+1891-1945,+sculptor.&amp;index=AUTHOR&amp;uindex=&amp;aspect=Browse&amp;menu=search&amp;ri=1 Walter Lippmann], from Smithsonian Institution.&lt;/ref&gt;

Kalish was the author of ''Labor Sculpture'', largely a collection of photographs of his statues of workers.  Most of the works in the book are in a [[Social realism]] style. Critic Emily Genauer wrote in 1938, "It is the workmen who dominate the American scene, and who have become as surely symbolic of their time as the pioneers in covered wagons, and the robber barons and the great merchant princes were in there respective eras." This was what Kalish portrayed in his art.&lt;ref&gt;Kalish, Max, ''Labor Sculpture'', Introduction by Emily Genauer, New York,  1938, copyright by Max Kalish, introduction&lt;/ref&gt; 

In 1939, Kalish lived in New York City and summered in Cleveland.&lt;ref name="Who"/&gt;

Various '''meditative postures''' have been used in [[meditation]]. Sitting, supine (lying), and standing&lt;ref name=Marshall&gt;{{Cite web| last = Marshall | first = Chris | title = Paradoxes of Standing Meditation | url = http://www.martialdevelopment.com/blog/four-paradoxes-of-standing-meditation/ | accessdate = 2007-10-23 }}&lt;/ref&gt; postures are used.

The bodily positions applied during Yoga are found at the Wikipedia page [[Asana]]. Most well known in the [[Buddhism|Buddhist]] and [[Hinduism|Hindu]] traditions, as well as in their modern forms, are the [[Lotus position|full-lotus]], [[half-lotus]], [[Burma|Burmese]], and [[kneeling]] positions.

Meditation can also be practiced while walking, such as [[kinhin]], or doing simple repetitive tasks, as in Zen [[Samu (Zen)|samu]], or work which encourages mindfulness.


==Cross-legged postures==
[[File:Meditation, Shimla.jpg|thumb]]
Cross legged sitting helps create a stable base for meditation. Several seated asanas are practiced such as [[full-lotus]], [[half-lotus]], easy crossed legs, or [[siddhasana]] ("perfect pose"). Sitting on the heels is possible, among other positions. [[Zafu|Seated meditation cushions]] are often used to help extend meditative time and serve to elevate the hips and spine into proper alignment

Sitting cross-legged (or upon one's knees) for extended periods when one is not sufficiently limber, can result in a range of [[ergonomic]] complaints called "meditator's knee". These are common and may be endured for long periods of time in extensive meditation retreats,&lt;ref&gt;Insight Yoga with Sarah Powers&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"&gt;The Three Pillars of Zen, edited by Philip Kapleau&lt;/ref&gt; however caution is often advised, and the guidance of an instructor or 'guru' is often sought extensively.

In the full-lotus, half-lotus and Burmese positions, used in Buddhism and Hinduism, it is often said&lt;ref name="ReferenceA"/&gt; that the [[vertebral column|spinal column]] must be kept "straight," that is, the individual should sit erect but relaxed, by balancing the torso such that the spinal column supports it in a natural way. One should feel comfortable and rest in a simple and unstrained way.

Sitting on a cushion that elevates the pelvis as high as or higher than the knees and then slightly rolling the pelvis forward makes it easier to keep the spine upright. It is said in multiple traditions that the chin should be slightly tucked in, the tongue pressed against the roof of the mouth, lips lightly pressed together shoulders back.

Those traditions related to [[kundalini yoga]], take a less formal approach. While the basic practice in these traditions is also to sit still quietly in a traditional posture, they emphasize the possibility of [[kriyas]]&amp;nbsp;– spontaneous yogic postures, changes in breathing patterns or emotional states, or perhaps repetitive physical movements such as swaying, etc., which may naturally arise as the practitioner sits in meditation, and which should not be resisted but rather allowed to express themselves to enhance the natural flow of energy through the body. This is said to help purify the [[nadis]] and ultimately deepen one's meditative practice.&lt;ref name=smith1986_p69&gt;Smith 1986, p. 69.&lt;/ref&gt;

Cross-legged postures, especially those such as the full-lotus, may be difficult due to a lack of familiarization. Most Westerners are not used to sitting in cross-legged positions for extended periods of time. For this reason Westerners are often advised to use a chair or a bench until they are ready for the traditional cross-legged positions. Yoga and stretching also are applicable as a means of developing the flexibility needed for the cross-legged postures.

If practiced routinely and done correctly, full-lotus is easy to maintain for long periods of time without discomfort, as muscular effort is used only keep the spine balanced, and not to support the weight of the torso.  Often this posture is explained as a way of encouraging the circulation of what some call "spiritual energy," the "vital breath", the "life force" (Sanskrit ''[[prana]]'', Chinese ''[[qi]]'', Latin ''spiritus'') or the [[Kundalini energy|Kundalini]]. It is said that one's meditation will not be as good if one's posture is not so good.&lt;ref&gt;both Lama Gursam, a yogi raised in a Tibetan monastery, and Khenpo Nyima Gyaltsen, a teacher at the Drikung Kagyu college, have told me this&lt;/ref&gt;

==Other postures== 
[[File:Walking meditation.jpg|thumb|right|Bas-relief in [[Sukhothai Historical Park|Sukhothai]], [[Thailand]] depicting monks during walking meditation.]]
In various traditions people meditate by sitting on a chair, flat-footed and without back support (as in [[New Thought]]); sitting on a stool (as in [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Orthodox Christianity]]); or walking (in [[Therevada]] Buddhism); or walking in mindfulness, which is known as [[kinhin]] (in [[Zen]] Buddhism).

==Hand gestures and position==
Various hand-gestures or [[mudra]]s may be prescribed in meditation. In [[Vajrayana Buddhism]] mudras carry symbolic meaning. According to Yogic philosophy the mudras affect consciousness, mood and energy.

For instance in Buddhist meditation the hands are often held with the right resting atop the left and thumbs touching. Some traditions hold say that each finger is associated with a different sensitivity and that the finger endings, lock into mudras, create subtle energy shifts due to these different energy circuit connections. Pressing on finger endings also stimulates brain sections relating to different qualities&amp;nbsp;– which a practitioner may want to enhance through meditation to invoke specific effects or changes. Other traditions hold that the right on top of left symbolizes the state of samsara while many common depictions of The Buddha have that he holds his left on top of right, due to his enlightenment.

==Eye focus and gaze==
In some schools such as [[Zen]], the eyes are half-closed and half-open, looking slightly downward. In others such as [[Brahma Kumaris]], the eyes are kept fully open. In other traditions the eyelids are kept 1/10 or barely open depending on what [[drishti (yoga)|drishti]] the meditation instructs. [[Drishti (yoga)|Drishti]] refers to eye focus in [[kundalini yoga]] and means "vision" or "insight" in [[Sanskrit]]. Pictures of saints in meditation may reflect different eye postures, and different meditations may call for staring into a saint's eyes, a candle flame, or some other object of focus, which is known as [[trataka]] meditation.

In Sufism, meditating ([[muraqaba]]) with the eyes closed is called [[Varood (Sufism)|Varood]] and keeping them open is known as [[Shahood]] or [[Fa'tha]].

Often such details are shared by more than one religion, even in cases where mutual influence seems unlikely. One example is "navel-gazing," which is apparently attested to within Eastern Orthodoxy as well as Chinese [[qigong]] practice. Another is the practice of focusing on the breath, found in Orthodox Christianity, [[Sufism]], and numerous Indic traditions.

The '''Militia Templi''' ({{lang-en|Militia of the Temple}}), also called the '''Order of the Poor Knights of Christ''' ({{lang-la|Christi Pauperum Militum Ordo}}), is a [[Lay brother|lay order]] of the [[Roman Catholic Church]].

==Overview==
[[Image:militia_castello.jpg|thumb|right|The [[Castello della Magione]] in Poggibonsi, built in the Eleventh Century, is the headquarters of the Militia Templi. It now consists of a church, the residence of the Grand Master, offices and guest rooms.]] 
[[Image:confirmations.jpg|thumb|right|Cardinal [[Antonio Innocenti]] during the Confirmation in the old rite in the Magistral Church. (At the left of the Cardinal is [[Silvano Piovanelli]], belonging to the Archdiocese of Siena and Prelate of the Militia Templi; to his left is Chancellor dom. Andrea Cappelli and the Grand Master.]]

The Militia Templi is a Roman Catholic private association of the faithful that celebrates its liturgy according to the traditional form in place in 1962, often referred to as the [[Tridentine Mass]].

Founded by the Italian Count [[Marcello Alberto Cristofani della Magione]] under the authority of the [[Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Siena-Colle di Val d'Elsa-Montalcino]], the Militia Templi's focus is knightly and monastic and members follow a modern adaptation of the Rule written by St. [[Bernard of Clairvaux]] for the medieval [[Knights Templar]]. The order makes no claims of direct descent from the old Knights Templar and holds that, when made, such self-styled claims are both historically and canonically false.

The Militia was formed civilly and with the approval of the local ordinary on September 21, 1979. Its constitutions were approved on Sept. 8, 1988 by the [[Archbishop of Siena]] [[Mario Jsmaele Castellano]]. The next Archbishop, [[Gaetano Bonicelli]] approved the Rule of the Militia in 1990. The Cardinal Protectors of the Militia Templi were [[Silvio Oddi]], [[Édouard Gagnon]] and [[Alfons Maria Stickler]]. The current Protector is the Right Reverend Phillip Lawrence,OSB, Abbot of the Benedictine Monastery of Christ in the Desert located in New Mexico, USA.

According to its constitutions, the Militia has both married and celibate members.  Professed Knights consecrate themselves perpetually to the Militia with the investiture and the promise to observe the three classic [[evangelical counsels]] as well as the public testimony of faith (fourth promise). The knights engage in different apostolates organized at the Preceptory and commandry level, each Knight is required to provide some type of service to the Church. They are obliged to live by their Rule and recite daily the Hours of the traditional [[Liturgy of the Hours|Divine Office]], do at least of quarter of an hour of mental prayer a day, go to confession monthly, make several annual retreats, have a spiritual director, engage in an apostolate, and perform the Ignatian exercises every 2 years. Their members include several hundred Knights, 10 national preceptories, many local priorates and scout groups.

==Magistral See==
The order's Magistral See, or headquarters, is situated in the [[Castello della Magione]].  It is a former Templar compound that lies in the village of [[Poggibonsi]] in the [[Tuscany]] region of Italy. Built in the 11th century, the castle was donated by its owners; Gottifredo di Arnolfo and Arnolfino di Cristofano to the monks of the Saint Michael Abbey in Poggio Marturi who later bestowed it to the Templars for use as one of their numerous "Mansiones" or "Domus Templi" along the [[Via Francigena]]. After 1312 the Castello della Magione passed through many hands, including the [[Hospitallers]] and the Princess Corsini, until, in 1979 it was purchased by Count Marcello Alberto Cristofani della Magione, the founder and current Grand Master of the Militia Templi. Attached to the castle is a church, also restored, with impressive Burgundian-Cistercian influence and is used daily by the order for the community recitation of [[Vespers]] and the celebration of the [[Tridentine Mass]].

== Symbol and habit ==
The symbol of the Militiae Templi is a red eight-pointed ("octagonal") cross, symbol of the Eight Beatitudes of the Gospel, while the symbol is a white flag with red octagonal cross. The cross is not to be confused with that of the medieval [[Knights Hospitaller]], which is known as the [[Maltese Cross]].  The habit of the Professed Knights is white and consists of a tunic, a scapular with cowl and the octagonal red cross on the chest, and a mantle with the same cross on the left shoulder. Ladies wear a white mantle and a white veil with a donat's cross (without the top section).  Chaplains are dressed with a white Mozzetta with red edge, red buttons and an octagonal red cross on the left front part.  The Oblati (Knights and Ladies of Devotion) have a  gray mantle with the red octagonal cross on the left shoulder.

==Spread in the world==
The Militia Templi through Preceptories or Magistral Legations, is currently present in the following countries: Italy, Australia, Austria, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, United Kingdom, Ireland, Poland, Romania, Spain, United States of America, Puerto Rico(1 Knight, 2 Novices), and Hungary.

'''Nankana Sahib District ''' ([[Punjabi language|Punjabi]] and {{lang-ur|{{Nastaliq|ضِلع ننكانہ صاحِب}}}})  is a [[Districts of Pakistan|district]] in the [[Punjab (Pakistan)|Punjab]] province of [[Pakistan]].  [[Nankana Sahib]] is the seat of the district government, and [[Shahkot, Pakistan|Shahkot]] is the largest urban center.  The district of Nankana Sahib is located about {{Convert|75|km|mi}} west of [[Lahore]] and about {{Convert|55|km|mi}} east of [[Faisalabad]].

According to the 1998 census results, the most widely spoken [[first language]]&lt;ref&gt;"Mother tongue": defined as the language of communication between parents and children.&lt;/ref&gt; in the Nankana Sahib Tehsil was [[Punjabi language|Punjabi]], accounting for {{sigfig|98.58|3}}% of the population, while [[Urdu]] was the native language of {{sigfig|0.41|2}}%.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book| title = 1998 District Census report of Sheikhupura| location = Islamabad| publisher = Population Census Organization, Statistics Division, Government of Pakistan| series = Census publication | volume =  79| date = 2000| pages = 105–6}}&lt;/ref&gt; According 2017 census, total district population is 1,356,774 of which 1,110,321 residing in rural area and 246,053 in urban area.

==Administration==
The area around [[Nankana Sahib]] was formerly a [[tehsil]] of [[Sheikhupura District]].  In May 2005, the Punjab government decided to raise the status of [[Nankana Sahib]] to that of a district&lt;ref&gt;[http://archives.dawn.com/weekly/herald/herald48.htm District Profile: Central Punjab- Nankana Sahib - Dawn Pakistan]&lt;/ref&gt; as a way of promoting development in the area, and investment from Indian Sikhs. {{fact|date=May 2016}}

== Education ==
District Nankana Sahib is ranked at the 26th position in the education score index of the [[Pakistan District Education Rankings]] 2017 published by [[Alif Ailaan|Alif Ailaan.]] The education score is composed of the learning score, retention score and gender parity score.

In the middle school infrastructure score index, which focuses on availability of basic facilities and the building condition of schools, Nankana Sahib ranks 51st.The facilities of electricity and drinking water in schools remain very good in the district with a 100% score. However, the building conditions are below average with a score of 45.07.

On the [https://elections.alifailaan.pk/taleemdo-app/ TaleemDo! App], majority residents of several areas within Nankana Sahib have complained about shortage of teachers available for schools and there is no access of transport available to schools located at larger distances.This issue is reported by a majority of female students.

==District development==
The possibility of the development of a university, named after Guru Nanak, has been raised.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.indianexpress.com/news/pak-govt-to-start-work-on-guru-nanak-varsity/544195/ |title=Pak govt to start work on Guru Nanak varsity at Nankana Sahib |publisher=Indian Express |date=2009-11-20 |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The Punjab government decided to link Nankana Sahib District with the provincial capital, [[Lahore]].  With these plans the Punjab government is completing "Khanqah Dogran Interchange" (on the M-2) very swiftly, which is a helpful project to develop the newly created District of Nankana Sahib.  This will also give access to the Grand Trunk Road, which leads to the [[Indian Punjab]] from the [[Wagah]] border. Nankana Sahib-Amritsar bus was inaugurated by Ex-Prime Minister of India [[Manmohan Singh]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://punjabroadways.gov.in/amritsar-nankana-sahib.html |title=Department of Transport, Punjab, India |publisher=Punjabroadways.gov.in |date= |accessdate=2013-02-18}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The '''nuragic holy well''' is a typical Sardinian hypogean [[Bronze Age]] structure for the worship of the waters. Scattered throughout the island, along with the [[Giants' grave]] and the megaron temples, they testify to the deep religiosity of the [[Nuragic civilization|Nuragic populations]]. These temples were a place of pilgrimage and ceremonies: it is believed that at certain times of year the various nuragic populations of the area gathered together in their vicinity.

The oldest temples were built in the style of the [[nuraghe]], with blocks of stone not perfectly squared; over time they were built with a greater accuracy. The most common type is composed of a circular well built with blocks of stone, which was accessed by steps that descended to water level.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.ilportalesardo.it/archeo/percorsi/pozzi_sacri.htm Pozzi Sacri, il portale sardo]{{it}}&lt;/ref&gt; They are a clear example of the architectural mastery of the nuragics and evidence of their reverence for water sources.

In the past it was thought that they were built between the eighth and sixth centuries BC; the latest findings, however, have led archaeologists to estimate that the temples date from the time when there was a close relationship between the [[Mycenaean kingdoms]], [[Crete]] and Sardinia (around 1300 BC). An almost certain dating comes from recent excavations in the Holy Well of [[Funtana Coberta]], near [[Ballao]], which lack completely Iron Age nuragic ceramics, while there are finds from the [[Aegean Islands|Aegean]]. The Well of Ballao was probably built in the late Bronze Age and abandoned some centuries later.

'''Our Lady of Mount Carmel''' is the title given to the [[Blessed Virgin Mary]] in her role as [[patron saint|patroness]] of the [[Carmelites|Carmelite Order]]. The first Carmelites were Christian [[hermits]] living on [[Mount Carmel]] in the [[Holy Land]] during the late 12th and early to mid-13th century. They built in the midst of their hermitages a [[Stella Maris Monastery|chapel]] which they dedicated to the Blessed Virgin, whom they conceived of in chivalric terms as the "Lady of the place." Our Lady of Mount Carmel was adopted in the 19th century as the patron saint of [[Chile]], in South America.

Since the 15th century, popular devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel has centered on the [[Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel]], also known as the Brown Scapular. Traditionally, Mary is said to have given the Scapular to an early Carmelite named Saint [[Simon Stock]]. The liturgical feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel is celebrated on 16 July.&lt;ref name="edwards"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Scapular Devotion." July–August 2005, Discalced Carmelite Secular Order, Washington Province.&lt;/ref&gt;

The solemn liturgical feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel was probably first celebrated in England in the later part of the 14th century. Its object was thanksgiving to Mary, the patroness of the Carmelite Order, for the benefits she had accorded to it through its difficult early years. The institution of the feast may have come in the wake of the vindication of their title "Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary" at Cambridge, England in 1374. The date chosen was 17 July; on the European mainland this date conflicted with the feast of [[Alexius of Rome|St. Alexis]], requiring a shift to 16 July, which remains the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel throughout the [[Catholic Church]]. The [[Latin]] poem ''"[[Flos Carmeli]]"'' (meaning "Flower of Carmel") first appears as the [[Sequentia|sequence]] for this [[Mass (liturgy)|Mass]].&lt;ref name="edwards"&gt;Bede Edwards, OCDS.  "St. Simon Stock—The Scapular Vision &amp; the Brown Scapular Devotion." ''Carmel Clarion'' Volume XXI, pp 17–22, July–August 2005, Discalced Carmelite Secular Order, Washington Province.&lt;/ref&gt;

==History==
{{more citations needed|section|date=July 2018}}&lt;!--3 paragraphs without citations--&gt;
The Carmelite Order was the only religious order to be started in the [[Crusader States]]. In the 13th century, some of its people migrated west to England, setting up a chapter and being documented there about 1241–1242. A tradition first attested to in the late 14th century says that [[Saint Simon Stock]], believed to be an early English prior general of the Carmelite Order soon after its migration to England,&lt;ref name="jotischky"/&gt; had a vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary in which she gave him the Brown Scapular. This formed part of the Carmelite [[habit]] after 1287.&lt;ref&gt;Jotischky, ''Carmelites and Antiquity,'' p. 59, footnote&lt;/ref&gt; In Stock's vision, Mary promised that those who died wearing the scapular would be saved.&lt;ref name="jotischky"&gt;{{cite book |url=https://books.google.com/books?id=gfjHzeh6QBEC| author=Andrew Jotischky| title=''The Carmelites and Antiquity. Mendicants and their Pasts in the Middle Ages''|publisher= Oxford University Press|location=Oxford |date=2002 |pages=37–38}}&lt;/ref&gt; This is a devotional sacramental signifying the wearer's consecration to Mary and affiliation with the Carmelite order. It symbolizes her special protection and calls the wearers to consecrate themselves to her in a special way.&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.franciscanmedia.org/our-lady-of-mount-carmel/ "Our Lady of Mount Carmel", Franciscan Media]&lt;/ref&gt;

In 1642, a Carmelite named Fr. John Cheron published a document which he said was a 13th-century letter written by Saint Simon Stock's secretary, Peter Swanington. Since the early 20th century, historians have concluded that this letter was forged, likely by Cheron himself.&lt;ref name="saggi"/&gt;&lt;ref name="dsouza"&gt;Fr. Paul D'Souza, OCD. [http://www.johnbaptistchurch.org/paul_article5.htm "The Carmelite Scapular: History and Devotion"], St. John the Baptist Church, Bangalore&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Herbert Thurston, S.J., [https://books.google.com/books?id=RAUQAAAAIAAJ&amp;pg=PA59&amp;lpg=PA59&amp;dq=%22peter+swanyngton%22+scapular+ecclesiastical&amp;source=bl&amp;ots=9lAt3TSkAE&amp;sig=6xlE3cRcVmdALp20EzS_Z6Tf_RE&amp;hl=en&amp;ei=cY_BSpKNDYvclAf-jpzvBA&amp;sa=X&amp;oi=book_result&amp;ct=result&amp;resnum=1#v=onepage&amp;q=&amp;f=false "The Origin of the Scapular – A Criticism"], ''The Irish Ecclesiastical Record,'' Vol XVI July–December 1904. pp. 59–75. Dublin: Browne &amp; Nolan, Limited. This 1904 article demonstrates that the Swanington letter was not authentic. It also says that the [[papal bull]] that was the basis of the "[[Sabbatine privilege]]" was forged. The article explores Carmelite history and the evolution of the scapular devotion.&lt;/ref&gt;

But Stock's vision was long embraced by many promoters of the scapular devotion. The forged Swanington letter claimed that 16 July 1251 was the date of the vision (16 July being the date of the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel), which led for centuries to a strong association between this feast day and the scapular devotion. Based on available historical documentation, the liturgical feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel did not originally have a specific association with the Brown Scapular or the tradition of Stock's vision of the Blessed Virgin Mary. This tradition grew gradually, as did the liturgical cult of St. Simon. The latter has been documented in Bordeaux, where Stock died, from the year 1435; in Ireland and England, from 1458; and in the rest of the Order, from 1564. Historians have long questioned whether Stock had the vision of Mary and the scapular.&lt;ref name="edwards"/&gt;&lt;ref name="saggi"&gt;Louis Saggi, O. Carm. [http://carmelnet.org/biographies/SimonStock.pdf "Saint Simon Stock (XIII Century) Saint, Priest"], Scholarly historical information, Carmel Net&lt;/ref&gt; Although Simon Stock was never officially canonized, his feast day was celebrated in the church.&lt;ref name="dsouza"/&gt; The Carmelite convent of [[Aylesford]], [[England]], was restored and a relic of Saint Simon Stock was placed there in 1951. The saint's feast is celebrated in the places dedicated to him.&lt;ref name="saggi"/&gt;

Also associated with Our Lady of Carmel was a papal bull saying that there was a ''[[Sabbatine privilege]]'' associated with devotion to the saint; that is, until the late 1970s, the Catholic liturgy for that day mentioned the scapular devotion. [[Vatican II]] resulted in scrutiny of the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel, as well as that of Saint Simon Stock, because of the historical uncertainties about the origins. The liturgies were revised and, in the 21st century, neither, even in the Carmelite proper, makes reference to the scapular.&lt;ref name="dsouza"/&gt; 

[[File:Virgen del Carmen - Paucartambo Peru.jpg|thumb|right|A [[saqra]] (animal figure) dancer watching the procession of ''Mamacha Carmen'' from a balcony]]
In Spain and other Spanish-speaking countries, there has been particular devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel, who has been adopted as a patron saint of several places, as she has been in other Catholic-majority countries. In addition, [[Carmen]] and María del Carmen have been popular given names for girls in Spanish-speaking countries. An annual festival, known as ''Mamacha Carmen,'' is held in the highland [[Paucartambo District, Paucartambo|Paucartambo District]], [[Peru]], featuring a procession with the Virgin and traditional dancers.{{cn|date=July 2018}} Veneration of the Virgen del Carmen (often also associated with the Stella Maris) is particularly strong in coastal towns of Spain.

==Carmelite devotion==
The Carmelites consider the Blessed Virgin Mary to be a perfect model of the interior life of [[prayer]] and [[contemplation]] to which Carmelites aspire, as well as a model of virtue, in the person who was closest in life to [[Jesus Christ]]. She is seen as the one who points Christians most surely to Christ. As she says to the servants at the [[wedding at Cana]], "Do whatever he [Jesus] tells you." Carmelites look to the Virgin Mary as a Spiritual Mother.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=http://www.ocd.pcn.net/mad_en.htm|title=The Virgin Mary of MT Carmel – DISCALCED CARMELITE ORDER|website=www.ocd.pcn.net}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Stella Maris Monastery]] (Star of the Sea) on Mount Carmel, named after a traditional title of the Blessed Virgin Mary, is considered the spiritual headquarters of the order.

Fr. Gabriel of St. Mary Magdalene de' Pazzi, OCD, a revered authority on Carmelite spirituality, wrote that devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel means:
{{quote|a special call to the interior life, which is preeminently a Marian life. Our Lady wants us to resemble her not only in our outward vesture but, far more, in heart and spirit. If we gaze into Mary's soul, we shall see that grace in her has flowered into a spiritual life of incalculable wealth: a life of recollection, prayer, uninterrupted oblation to God, continual contact, and intimate union with him. Mary's soul is a sanctuary reserved for God alone, where no human creature has ever left its trace, where love and zeal for the glory of God and the salvation of mankind reign supreme. [...] Those who want to live their devotion to Our Lady of Mt. Carmel to the full must follow Mary into the depths of her interior life. Carmel is the symbol of the contemplative life, the life wholly dedicated to the quest for God, wholly orientated towards intimacy with God; and the one who has best realized this highest of ideals is Our Lady herself, 'Queen and Splendor of Carmel'."&lt;ref name="edwards"/&gt;}}

==Prayer to the Blessed Mother of Mount Carmel==
{{quote|O most beautiful flower of Mt. Carmel, fruitful vine, splendor of Heaven, Blessed Mother of the Son of God, Immaculate Virgin, assist me in my necessity. O Star of the Sea, help me and show me you are my Mother. O Holy Mary, Mother of God, Queen of Heaven and earth, I humbly beseech you from the bottom of my heart to succor me in this necessity (make request). There are none that can withstand your power. O Mary, conceived without sin, pray for us who have recourse to thee. Sweet Mother I place this cause in your hands. Amen.}}

==Church teaching==
A 1996 doctrinal statement approved by the [[Congregation for Divine Worship and the Discipline of the Sacraments]] states that 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"Devotion to Our Lady of Mount Carmel is bound to the history and spiritual values of the Order of the Brothers of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel and is expressed through the scapular.  Thus, whoever receives the scapular becomes a member of the order and pledges him/herself to live according to its spirituality in accordance with the characteristics of his/her state in life."&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.webcitation.org/query?url=http://www.geocities.com/korvesem/carmel/doctrinalstatement.html&amp;date=2009-10-26+01:29:35 Doctrinal Statement on the Brown Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel], approved by the Congregation for Divine Worship and for the Discipline of the Sacraments, November 29, 1996. See [http://www.icspublications.org/bookstore/others/b_others13.html "Catechesis and Ritual for the Scapular of Our Lady of Mount Carmel"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070523112955/http://www.icspublications.org/bookstore/others/b_others13.html |date=2007-05-23 }}, Prepared under the direction of the North American Provincials of the Carmelite Orders. 2000.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

According to the Church on the Brown Scapular: 
&lt;blockquote&gt;"The scapular is a Marian habit or garment. It is both a sign and pledge. A sign of belonging to Mary; a pledge of her motherly protection, not only in this life but after death. As a sign, it is a conventional sign signifying three elements strictly joined: first, belonging to a religious family particularly devoted to Mary, especially dear to Mary, the Carmelite Order; second, consecration to Mary, devotion to and trust in her Immaculate Heart; third, an urge to become like Mary by imitating her virtues, above all her humility, chastity, and spirit of prayer."&lt;ref&gt;Fr. Kieran Kavanaugh, OCD,  [http://www.zenit.org/article-23225?l=english "Brown Scapular: A Silent Devotion"] {{webarchive|url=https://web.archive.org/web/20090504164642/http://www.zenit.org/article-23225?l=english |date=2009-05-04 }}, Zenit News Service, 16 July 2008.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Association with Purgatory==
[[File:V.Carmen de Beniajan-general.jpg|thumb|right|Our Lady of Mount Carmel with angels and souls in [[Purgatory]]. Baroque sculpture from [[Beniaján]] (Spain).]]
Since the Middle Ages, Our Lady of Mount Carmel has been related to Purgatory, where souls are purged of sins in the fires. In some images, she is portrayed as accompanied with angels and souls wearing Brown Scapulars, who plead for her mediation. In 1613, the Church forbade images to be made of Our Lady of Mt. Carmel descending into purgatory, due to errors being preached about certain privileges associated with the Brown Scapular (known as "the [[Sabbatine Privilege]]").&lt;ref&gt;''1912 Catholic Encyclopedia''. [http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13289b.htm Sabbatine Privilege] – "The Bull [of the Holy Roman General Inquisition 20 January 1613, clarifying what is permissible for the Carmelites to preach regarding the Brown Scapular"] forbids the painting of pictures representing, in accordance with the wording of the Bull, the Mother of God descending into purgatory (cum descensione beatae Virginis ad animas in Purgatorio liberandas)."&lt;/ref&gt;

That privilege appears in the noted Decree of the Holy Office (1613). It was inserted in its entirety (except for the words forbidding the painting of the pictures) into the list of the indulgences and privileges of the Confraternity of the Scapular of Mount Carmel.&lt;ref&gt;[http://www.newadvent.org/cathen/13289b.htm Sabbatine Privilege]&lt;/ref&gt; In the 21st century, the Carmelites do not promote the Sabbatine Privilege. They encourage a belief in Mary's general aid and prayerful assistance for their souls beyond death, especially her aid to those who devoutly wear the Brown Scapular, and commend devotion to Mary especially on Saturdays, which are dedicated to her.

==Apparitions==
Our Lady of Mount Carmel was seen in the apparitions of [[Cova da Iria]] in [[Fátima, Portugal]], by [[Sister Lúcia|Lúcia Santos]] and her co-visionary companions Jacinta and Francisco Marto and many others among the 70,000 witnesses of the extraordinary events during the [[Miracle of the Sun]]. She also appeared to [[Simon Stock|Saint Simon Stock]] to whom she gave the [[Brown Scapular]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|title=The Messages of Fatima|url=http://miraclehunter.com/marian_apparitions/messages/fatima_messages.html|quote=Lucia also saw Our Lady of Mount Carmel who signifies the triumph over suffering.}}&lt;/ref&gt; The [[Garabandal apparitions]], in [[Spain]], were reported to be images of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mount Carmel.
 
[[Acquafondata]], Italy, the apparition of the Virgin of Mount Carmel, on July 16, 1841. There is today a small sanctuary on the site.

==Miracles==
In [[Palmi]], [[Italy]], the anniversary of the earthquake of 1894 is observed annually on 16 November.&lt;ref&gt;See the wikipedia article on Italian {{it}} [[:it:Festa della Beata Vergine del Carmelo (Palmi)|Festa della Beata Vergine del Carmelo (Palmi)]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2018}} The earthquake had its epicenter in the city. An associated event has been classified as the "miracle of Our Lady of Mount Carmel." For 17 days preceding this earthquake, many of the faithful had reported strange eye movements and changes in the coloring of the face in a statue of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. The local and national press reported these occurrences.

In the evening of 16 November, the faithful improvised a procession carrying the statue of the Virgin of Carmel on their shoulders through the streets. When the procession reached the end of the city, a violent earthquake shook the whole district of Palmi,&lt;ref&gt;''Il terremoto del 16 novembre 1894 in calabria e sicilia'', Roma, 1907. Tesot full archive available: [https://archive.org/stream/ilterremotodeln00sicigoog#page/n7/mode/2up Relazione scientifica sul terremoto]&lt;/ref&gt; ruining most of the old houses along the way. But, only nine people died out of a population of about 15,000 inhabitants, as almost all of the population had been on the street to watch the procession and were not trapped inside the destroyed buildings. Therefore, the city commemorates the 1894 procession each year, accompanied by firecrackers, lights, and festive stalls.

The Catholic Church has officially recognized the miracle.&lt;ref&gt;See the wikipedia article on Italian {{it}} [[:it:Miracolo della Madonna del Carmine di Palmi|Miracolo della Madonna del Carmine di Palmi]]&lt;/ref&gt;{{better source|date=July 2018}} On November 16, 1896 the statue of the Virgin was crowned, based on the decree issued September 22, 1895 by the [[Holy See|Vatican]] Chapter.{{citation needed|date=July 2018}}

==Use in the peace movement==
The first atomic bomb was exploded in the United States at the Trinity test site on 16 July 1945, near [[Alamogordo, New Mexico]].  The Catholic anti-war movement has built on the coincidence between this date and the Feast of Our Lady of Mount Carmel. In 1990, the Rev. [[Emmanuel Charles McCarthy]], a priest of the Eastern Rite (Byzantine-Melkite) of the Catholic Church, initiated the "16 July Twenty-Four Hours Day of Prayer," for Forgiveness and Protection with Our Lady of Mount Carmel, at Trinity Site in the New Mexico desert. Each year on 16 July, a prayer vigil is conducted at the Trinity site to pray for peace and the elimination of nuclear weapons.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.beyondnuclear.org/nuclear-weapons/2014/7/16/69-years-since-trinity-the-first-atomic-blast.html |title=69 years since "Trinity," the first atomic blast |last=McCarthy |first=Emmanuel |date=2014-07-16 |website=Beyond Nuclear |language=en |access-date=2018-07-14}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''Peter Howard Gilmore''' (born May 24, 1958) is an American composer, artist, and author. He is the [[high priest]] of the [[Church of Satan]]{{sfn|Open Questions: Diverse Thinkers Discuss God, Religion, and Faith|Luís F. Rodrigues|2010|p=125}} and author of ''[[The Satanic Scriptures]]''.{{sfn|Handbook of Religion and the Authority of Science|2010|page=93}} Gilmore graduated from [[NYU]] with both a [[Bachelor's degree|bachelor's]] and [[master's degree]] in music composition.{{citation needed|date=March 2016}}

He was appointed [[wiktionary:High Priest|High Priest]] of the Church in 2001 by Magistra [[Blanche Barton]]. As a representative of the Church of Satan, Gilmore has been interviewed on numerous [[television]] and [[radio]] programs dealing with the topic of [[Satanism]], including appearances on [[History (U.S. TV channel)|History]], the [[BBC]], [[Syfy]], ''[[Point of Inquiry]]'', and [[Bob Larson]]'s [[Christian]] radio show.{{sfn|Open Questions: Diverse Thinkers Discuss God, Religion, and Faith|Luís F. Rodrigues|2010|page=125}}

==Biography==
{{Wikinews|Satanism: An interview with Church of Satan High Priest Peter Gilmore}}
Gilmore was raised in [[upstate New York]]. He visited [[New York City]] regularly throughout his youth and moved to [[Hell's Kitchen, Manhattan|Hell's Kitchen]] in 1980. He read ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'' at age thirteen and has described [[The Church of Satan]] as "the motivating philosophical force in my life" ever since.{{sfn|Open Questions: Diverse Thinkers Discuss God, Religion, and Faith|Luís F. Rodrigues|2010|page=125}}

In 1989, he and his wife [[Peggy Nadramia]] began publishing a Satanic journal, ''[[The Black Flame (magazine)|The Black Flame]]'', and continues to publish issues sporadically. In 2005, Gilmore wrote the new introduction to [[Anton LaVey]]'s ''[[The Satanic Bible]]'', and his essay on Satanism was published in ''The Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature''.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=i4mvAwAAQBAJ&amp;printsec=frontcover&amp;dq=The+Encyclopedia+of+Religion+and+Nature&amp;hl=en&amp;sa=X&amp;ved=0CB0Q6AEwAGoVChMIz6qVm-ngyAIVT_FjCh0M6gG6#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false|title=The Encyclopedia of Religion and Nature|work=google.com}}&lt;/ref&gt;

===The Satanic Scriptures===
In [[Walpurgis Night]] 2007, a hard cover edition of ''[[The Satanic Scriptures]]'', a book that collects his essays and other writings was released. On October 13, 2007, a paperback ({{ISBN|0976403595}}) was released. The book includes rituals that were previously not public, such as marriages and Satanic burials.

In Walpurgis Night of 2012, it was announced that an edition in [[Spanish language|Spanish]] was in production to be released on Halloween.

===Essays===
A large part of the essays were released before the book, however, some of the essays included in the book are improved variations. Some, including the essay published in the extract, deal with what the Church of Satan considers pseudo-Satanists, and those who refuse to join the Church, forming their own groups. Magus Gilmore is not too critical of the legitimate Satanists who never join the Church itself, yet disdainfully denounces heretical devil-worshiping [[Christianism|Christians]] who foolishly [[Animal sacrifice|sacrifice animals]] and worship a legendary and anti-theistic God.

Other essays touch on the similarity between [[Fascism|fascist aesthetics]] and Satanism, along with a multitude of political issues that correlate with the Satanic point of view, as the Index released demonstrates. It includes, but is not limited to, issues such as terrorism in the United States, [[Gay rights|gay rights]], and much more.

===Rituals===
Many of the rituals detailed in the book were previously only known to members of the priesthood in the Church of Satan, as the wedding rite that was carried out by the founder Anton LaVey, along with the details of a Satanic funeral, is supposed which is a variation of which was made for him.

      <text xml:space="preserve" bytes="13688">'''Christian political theology in the Middle East''' is a religious response by [[Christianity|Christian]] leaders and scholars to political problems. [[Political theology|Political theologians]] try to balance the demands of a tumultuous region with the delicate but long history of [[Christianity in the Middle East]]. This has yielded a diversity of political theology disproportionate to the small size of [[Middle East]]ern Christian minorities. The region's importance to Christians worldwide&amp;nbsp;– both for history and doctrinal authority for many [[Christian denominations|denominations]]&amp;nbsp;– also shapes the political theologies of the Middle East.

== Background ==
For many [[Christianity|Christian]] leaders, the dominant approach to [[political theology]] is one of survival. Many [[Arab Christians]] see themselves as the heirs of a rich Christian heritage whose existence is threatened by regional unrest and religious persecution. Their chief political goal is survival, which sets their political theology apart.{{sfn|Wessels|1995|pp=203–227}}

At times, Arab Christian leaders have appealed to Christians outside the region through both [[Christian denominations|denominational]] challenges and broader calls to Christian unity for humanitarian or political aid. In other cases, Christian politicians downplay their faith in the public sphere to avoid conflict with their [[Muslim]] neighbours.{{sfn|Cragg|1991|pp=143–227}}

In the mid-20th century, many [[Christianity in the Middle East|Christians in the Middle East]] saw secular politics as a way out of their traditional status as a minority community in the [[Islamic world]].{{sfn|Cragg|1991|pp=143–227}} Christians played prominent roles throughout the [[pan-Arabism|pan-Arab]] [[Arab nationalism|nationalist]] movement in the mid-20th century, where their experience with Western politics and generally high educational attainments made their contributions valuable to [[nationalism|nationalist]] governments around the region. One prominent example was [[Michel Aflaq]], an [[Eastern Orthodox Church|Eastern Orthodox Christian]], who formed the first [[Ba'ath Party|Ba’ath]] group from students in Damascus in the 1940s. His belief was that Christians should embrace [[Islam]] as part of their cultural identity because nationalism was the best way for Christians to be successful in the Middle East.{{sfn|Cragg|1991|pp=143–227}}

== Approaches to political theology ==
With the shift from pan-Arab nationalist movements into Islam-oriented politics, Christians have changed their approach. They have also lost influence because their numbers have declined due to birthrate, emigration, and sometimes overt persecution. Some Christians seek to emphasize the historic Christian presence as a sign of their commitment to the homeland. This ties the Christian minority to the national identity. These Christians often point to the presence of shrines and holy sites nearby to justify the importance of remaining in the [[Middle East]]. They emphasize their homeland as the birthplace of Christianity, even at the sacrifice of some religious duties such as evangelical work, as conversion from Islam is illegal in most Middle Eastern countries.{{sfn|Bailey|Bailey|2003|pp=6–157}}

Other Christians who live in nations with governments less friendly to them emphasize their ties as Christians with political power in Europe and the United States. They sometimes call on these ties through the corresponding religious leaders in Western nations in the hope that foreign governments will aid their causes from the outside.{{sfn|Cragg|1991|pp=143–227}}

=== Israel/Palestine ===
[[Palestinian Christians]] make up two per cent of the population in Israel and the West Bank/Gaza, and Christians generally emphasize their [[Palestinians|Palestinian]] identity over their religious identity in political affairs. Their generally high educational attainments made them key leaders causes for [[Palestinian nationalism]], where they emphasized their historic ties to the Holy Land and religious bonds with Muslims and [[Jews]], but the rise of [[Hamas]], and their own declining numbers, has changed the Christian approach to one of influence rather than direct wielding of power.{{sfn|Bailey|Bailey|2003|pp=6–157}}

==== Palestinian liberation theology ====
{{see also|Liberation theology#Palestinian liberation theology}}
Palestinian liberation theology was developed during the first Palestinian [[Intifada]] in the 1980s. It was an effort to reconcile the Christian duties of love and forgiveness, as well as the role of the [[Bible]] in Christian and Jewish [[Zionism]], with the struggles of the [[Israeli–Palestinian conflict]].{{sfn|Wessels|1995|pp=203–227}} Like [[liberation theology]] of Latin America, it emphasizes justice for Palestinians while insisting on the need for Christian love.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |last=Ateek |first=Naim |author-link=Naim Ateek |date=24 March 2014 |title=Land and Liberation: An Interview with Reverend Naim Ateek |url=https://rabbibrant.com/2014/03/24/land-and-liberation-an-interview-with-reverend-naim-ateek/ |website=Shalom Rav |interviewer-last=Rosen |interviewer-first=Brant |interviewer-link=Brant Rosen |access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==== Key figures ====
* '''[[Naim Ateek]]''', an Anglican priest whose family settled in Jerusalem after expulsion from the Galilee, founded Palestinian Liberation Theology and published a book in 1989 called ''Justice and Only Justice: A Palestinian Theology of Liberation''.{{sfn|Wessels|1995|pp=203–227}}
* '''[[Elias Chacour]]''', a former archbishop in the Greek Orthodox Melkite Church, has worked to create a liberation theology that emphasizes love and support for both Jews and Palestinians. He has used educational activism and non-violent political protest to call for Palestinian equality in Israel.{{sfn|Weaver|2012|pp=194–202}}
* '''[[Mitri Raheb]]''', an Evangelical Lutheran priest in Bethlehem, writes that the people of the Holy Land have lived under an occupying power since the time of Jesus. His writings use the Bible to establish a place for Palestinians in the Christian narrative.{{sfn|Raheb|2012}}

=== Jordan ===
[[Christianity in Jordan|Christians in Jordan]] are either descendants of the native [[Bedouin]] tribes or of [[Palestinian refugees]], and they point to their historic presence in the area, which predates Islam, as a way of proving their loyalty to [[Jordan]]'s sympathetic [[monarchy of Jordan|monarchy]].{{sfn|Bailey|Bailey|2003|pp=6–157}} Christian politicians formed a surprising political alliance with the [[Muslim Brotherhood]] during the [[Jordanian general election, 2016|2016 campaign]] season. Christians justify this by pointing to the need to maintain their historic presence for family and religious reasons, given their proximity to many holy sites.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Luck |first=Taylor |date=19 September 2016 |title=In a First for Middle East Politics, Christians and Islamists Stump Together |url=http://www.csmonitor.com/World/Middle-East/2016/0919/In-a-first-for-Middle-East-politics-Christians-and-Islamists-stump-together |newspaper=Christian Science Monitor |issn=0882-7729 |access-date=29 October 2016}}&lt;/ref&gt;

== Key documents ==
Christian leaders in the Middle East garner support from fellow Christians in other nations, sometimes by issuing direct calls to act on the demands made by their political theology.

=== Kairos Palestine document ===
The [[Kairos Palestine|Kairos document]] is a call from Palestinian Christian leaders for peaceful co-existence in the Holy Land, beginning with a re-negotiation of rights in Jerusalem for "two peoples" and "three religions". The document's theology begins with an insistence on God's love for all people and for Christian love for others, which sometimes requires strong action. The Kairos document argues against theologians who use the Bible to justify a religious state in the Holy Land, where Palestinian Christians and Muslims have a "natural right" to live. The authors place their hope for peace in God rather than political action, saying "resistance with love" is "a right and a duty for the Christian". The document references the Apostle Paul's statement to not resist evil with evil, but it stops short of condemning terrorism, calling instead for a removal of the "roots of 'terrorism'".{{sfn|''A Moment of Truth''|2009}}

=== ''From the Nile to the Euphrates'' ===
The Christian Academic Forum for Citizenship in the Arab World released the region's first "public theology" in 2014, titled ''From the Nile to the Euphrates: The Call of Faith and Citizenship''. The document's authors are scholars from [[Egypt]], [[Syria]], [[Lebanon]], Jordan, Palestine, and Iraq, and it critically analyzes the role of religion in helping with the region's educational, social, and structurally political problems. The document stresses religion's potential for harm in political life multiple times and repeatedly emphasizes the need for Christians and Muslims to work together using principles of equality and freedom.{{sfn|Christian Academic Forum for Citizenship in the Arab World|2014}}

The '''Imams of Yemen''' and later the '''Kings of Yemen''' were [[religious]]ly [[consecrated]] leaders belonging to the [[Zaidiyyah]] branch of [[Shia Islam]]. They established a blend of religious and [[secular]] rule in parts of [[Yemen]] from 897. Their [[imamate]] endured under varying circumstances until the [[North Yemen Civil War|republican revolution]] in 1962. [[Zaidiyyah]] theology differed from [[Ismailis]] or [[Twelver Shi'ites]] by stressing the presence of an active and visible [[imam]] as leader. The imam was expected to be knowledgeable in religious sciences, and to prove himself a worthy headman of the community, even in battle if this was necessary. A claimant of the imamate would proclaim a "call" ([[da'wa]]), and there were not infrequently more than one claimant.&lt;ref&gt;Jane Hathaway, ''A Tale of Two Factions; Myth, Memory, and identity in Ottoman Egypt and Yemem''. New York 2003, pp. 79-81.&lt;/ref&gt;  The historian [[Ibn Khaldun]] (d. 1406) mentions the clan that usually provided the imams as the Banu Rassi or '''Rassids'''.&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Kay, ''Yaman: Its early medieval history'', London 1892, p. 185.&lt;/ref&gt; In the original [[Arab]] sources the term Rassids is otherwise hardly used; in Western literature it usually refers to the Imams of the [[medieval]] period, up to the 16th century. The Rassid branch that came to power with imam [[al-Mansur al-Qasim]] (r. 1597-1620) is known as '''Qasimids''' (Al al-Qasimi).

==The establishment of the imamate==

The imams based their legitimacy on descent from the Islamic prophet [[Muhammad]], mostly via the prominent Zaydiyya theologian al-Qasim ar-Rassi (d. 860) - his cognomen refers to ar-Rass, a property in the vicinity of [[Mecca]] that he owned.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyklopädie des Islam'', Vol. 3, Leiden 1936, p. 1216.&lt;/ref&gt; After him, the medieval imams are sometimes known as Rassids. The first of the ruling line, his grandson [[al-Hadi ila'l-Haqq Yahya]], was born in [[Medina]]. His fame as an intellectual as well as a leader of note, led to his invitation to Yemen. He was summoned to govern the highland tribes in 893 and again in 896-97. Al-Hadi introduced a multitude of policies and practices that evolved into the particular Yemeni [[Zaidiyyah|Zaidi]] [[Shia]] brand. The efforts of al-Hadi eventually became the basic guidelines for the religious as well as political characteristics of Yemeni Zaydism. Al-Hadi, however, was not able to consolidate his rule in all of Yemen. He could not even create an enduring state in the highlands, due to the strong localism persisting in the region. There were revolts as well as segments of the population that did not accept his and his successors' pretensions to religio-political rule.&lt;ref&gt;Cornelis van Arendonk, ''Les débuts de l'imamat zaidite au Yemen''. Leiden 1960&lt;/ref&gt;

Although he did not succeed in establishing any permanent administrative infrastructure, al-Hadi's descendants became the local aristocracy of the northern highlands, and it is from among them that most of the imams of Yemen were selected for the next one thousand years. Occasionally the imams were drawn from other lines descending from Muhammad.&lt;ref&gt;''Enzyklopädie des Islam'', Vol. III, Leiden 1936, p. 1216&lt;/ref&gt;

Yemen throughout most of that period was only rarely a unified political entity; in fact, what was included within its frontiers varied widely, and it has not been governed consistently or uniformly by any single set of rulers except for brief periods. It existed as a part of a number of different political systems/ruling dynasties between the ninth and sixteenth centuries, after which it became a part of the [[Ottoman Empire]].

==Rivalries with other dynasties==

After Imam al-Hadi's death in 911, his sons took over the imamate in turn, although it was not hereditary but rather elective among the descendants of Muhammad. From the 11th to the early 17th centuries, however, the imams were usually not chosen from the sons of the former imam, but rather circulated among the various Rassid branches. Meanwhile, a multitude of smaller dynasties and families established themselves in the highlands, as well as in [[Tihama]] (the low coastal plain) where the imams rarely ruled. Among the better known of these are the [[Yufirids|Yu'firids]] (in San'a and Shibam, 847-997), the [[Sulayhid dynasty|Sulayhids]] (in the southern highlands, 1047-1138), the [[Zurayids|Zuray'ids]] (in Aden, 1080-1174), and the [[Hamdanid sultans|Hatimids]] (in San'a, 1098-1174).&lt;ref&gt;H.C. Kay, ''Yaman: Its early medieval history''. London 1892&lt;/ref&gt; It was during this period, when the [[Fatimid]] state was influential, that a portion of the population was converted to [[Ismailism|Isma'ili]] [[Shia Islam|Shiʿism]].

Beginning with the conquest of Yemen by the family of [[Saladin|Salah al-Din ibn Ayyub]] (Saladin) in 1174, a series of dynasties exercised a modicum of control and administration in Yemen for roughly the next 400 years; these are, in chronological sequence, the [[Ayyubids]], from 1173/74 to 1229; the [[Rasulids]], from 1229 to 1454; the [[Tahirids (Yemen)|Tahirids]], from 1454 to 1517; and the [[Mamluks]], from 1517 to 1538, when the [[Ottoman Empire]] took the Yemeni Tihama.&lt;ref&gt;For the chronology of these, see Peter Truhart, ''Regents of nations'', Vol. 3, München 2003, pp. 1090-1.&lt;/ref&gt;

During most of this period, the dynasties and their rulers were primarily engaged in familial, regional, and occasionally sectarian disputes. Ironically, the [[Sunni]] [[Rasulids]], who eventually concentrated their rule in southern Yemen for precisely that reason, were the dynasty under which the region experienced the greatest economic growth and political stability.&lt;ref&gt;''Encyclopaedia of Islam'', Vol. VIII, Leiden 1995, pp. 455-7.&lt;/ref&gt;

For part of the medieval era the Zaydiyyah imams were eclipsed by the lowland dynasties, and for long periods there would be no imam at all (especially in 1066-1138 and 1171-1187). From the end of the thirteenth century the political fortunes of the Zaydiyya imams revived somewhat. They were able to hold their own against the Rasulids and Tahirids and sometimes expand their territory. Often, however, and especially after 1436, the imamate was split between several contenders.

Comparatively little is known about the medieval Zaydi imams and their efforts to establish themselves and develop some form of administration (including tax collection), or their success in promoting Zaydi goals during this period. From the available evidence, there was very little continuity and a great deal of competition among the Zaydi families and clans. For example, in a presumably representative two-hundred-year period from the thirteenth to the fifteenth centuries, there appear to have been more than twenty different candidates for the imamate, representing more than ten distinct clans.

==The Qasimid state==

Eventually the Europeans entered the [[Middle East]], specifically the [[Portugal|Portuguese]] and then others, in the effort to control the [[Red Sea]] trade. For the Zaydiyya imams, however, the Ottomans constituted the greater external threat. Ottoman expeditions managed to defeat the highland tribesmen in the mid decades of the sixteenth century. From the early 17th century [[al-Mansur al-Qasim]], belonging to one the Rassid branches (later known as the Qasimids), raised the standard of rebellion. His son [[al-Mu'ayyad Muhammad]] managed to gather the entire Yemen under his authority, expel the Turks, and establish an independent political entity. For a time, the imams ruled a comprehensive territory, including [[South Yemen]] and areas even further to the east. Their economic base was strengthened by the coffee trade of the coastal entrepot [[Mocha, Yemen|Mocha]]. Unlike in the previous practice, the Qasimids ruled as a hereditary dynasty.

The power of the [[imamate]] declined in the 18th and 19th century. The territory controlled by the imams shrank successively after the late 17th century, and the lucrative coffee trade declined with new producers in other parts of the world. [[Al-Mutawakkil Isma'il]] expanded the Qasimid state to it' greatest extent. The Qasimid state has been characterized as a "quasi-state" with an inherent tension between tribes and government, and between tribal culture and learned Islamic morality. The imams themselves adopted the style of Middle East monarchies, becoming increasingly distant figures. As a result, they eventually lost their charismatic and spiritual position among the tribes of Yemen.&lt;ref&gt;Vincent Steven Wilhite, ''Guerilla war, counterinsurgency, and state formation in Ottoman Yemen'', PhD Thesis, Ohio State University 2003, p. 130.&lt;/ref&gt; The imamate was further eclipsed by the second coming of the Turks to lowland Yemen in 1848, and to the highlands in 1872. However, the Ottoman troops were never able to entirely quell resistance against Turkish rule. The occupants were eventually driven out by 1918, by a [[Qasimid]] side-branch which inaugurated the [[Mutawakkilite Kingdom of Yemen]].

==Modern history==

For the next 44 years [[North Yemen]] was ruled by two powerful imams. [[Yahya Muhammad Hamid ed-Din|al-Mutawakkil Yahya Muhammad Hamid ad-Din]] and his son [[Ahmad bin Yahya]] created a king-state there much as the kings of England and France had done centuries earlier. The two imams strengthened the state and secured its borders. They used the imamate to insulate Yemen and revitalize its Islamic culture and society at a time when traditional societies around the world were declining under imperial rule. While Yemen under the two imams seemed almost frozen in time, a small but increasing number of Yemenis became aware of the contrast between an autocratic society they saw as stagnant and the political and economic modernization occurring in other parts of the world. This produced an important chain of events: the birth of the nationalist [[Free Yemeni Movement]] in the mid-1940s, an aborted 1948 revolution in which Imam Yahya was killed, a failed 1955 coup against Imam Ahmad, and finally, the 1962 takeover in which imam [[Muhammad al-Badr]] was deposed by a group of Egyptian supported and financed Sunni officers and the [[Yemen Arab Republic]] (YAR) was proclaimed under the leadership of [[Abdullah al-Sallal]].&lt;ref&gt;Paul Dresch, ''A history of modern Yemen'', Cambridge 2000, pp. 28-88, http://catdir.loc.gov/catdir/samples/cam031/00029266.pdf&lt;/ref&gt;

The first five years of President Al-Sallal's rule, from 1962 to 1967, comprised the first chapter in the history of North Yemen. Marked by the revolution that began it, this period witnessed a lengthy civil war between Yemeni republican forces, based in the cities and supported by Egypt, and the royalist supporters of the deposed imam, backed by [[Saudi Arabia]] and [[Jordan]]. In 1965 Egyptian president [[Gamal Abdel Nasser]] met with King [[Faisal of Saudi Arabia|Faisal]] of Saudi Arabia to consider a possible settlement to the civil war. The meeting resulted in an agreement whereby both countries pledged to end their involvement and allow the people of North Yemen to choose their own government. Subsequent peace conferences were ineffectual, however, and fighting flared up again in 1966.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.globalsecurity.org/military/world/war/yemen.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

By 1967 the war had reached a stalemate, and the republicans had split into opposing factions concerning relations with Egypt and Saudi Arabia. In late 1967 Al-Sallal’s government was overthrown and he was replaced as president by [[Abdul Rahman al-Iryani]]. Fighting continued until 1970, when Saudi Arabia halted its aid to royalists and established diplomatic ties with North Yemen. Al-Iryani effected the long-sought truce between republican and royalist forces, and presided over the adoption of a democratic constitution in 1970. The last ruling Rassid descendant [[Muhammad al-Badr]], greatly disappointed  by the Saudi recognition of the republic, emigrated to [[London]] where he died in 1996.&lt;ref&gt;http://www.nationsonline.org/oneworld/History/Yemen-history.htm&lt;/ref&gt;

In June 1974 military officers led by Colonel [[Ibrahim al-Hamdi]] staged a bloodless coup, claiming that the government of Al-Iryani had become ineffective. The constitution was suspended, and executive power was vested in a command council, dominated by the military. Al-Hamdi chaired the council and attempted to strengthen and restructure politics in North Yemen. Al-Hamdi was assassinated in 1977, and his successor, former Chief of Staff [[Ahmad al-Ghashmi|Ahmed Hussein al-Ghashmi]], was killed in June 1978.&lt;ref&gt;An account of the political history up to the late 1970s can be found in Robert W. Stookey, ''Yemen: The Politics of the Yemen Arab Republic''. Boulder 1978.&lt;/ref&gt; The lengthy tenure of President [[Ali Abdullah Saleh]], who ruled North Yemen from 1978 until it merged with [[South Yemen]] in 1990, proved more stable. Saleh strengthened the political system, while an influx of foreign aid and the discovery of oil in North Yemen held out the prospect of economic expansion and development.&lt;ref&gt;Paul Dresch, ''A history of modern Yemen'', Cambridge 2000, pp. 151-214.&lt;/ref&gt;

==List of imams==

'''Sakka''' or '''Saqqa''' ({{lang-ar|سكا}}) is a village to the southeast of [[Damascus]], on the edge of the [[Ghouta]], {{convert|5|km|mi}} north west of [[Damascus International Airport]] in [[Syria]].&lt;ref name="Burns2005"&gt;{{cite book|author=Ross Burns|title=Damascus: A History|url=https://books.google.com/books?id=xTs77Ft6FXQC&amp;pg=PA4|accessdate=21 September 2012|date=20 January 2005|publisher=Taylor &amp; Francis|isbn=978-0-415-27105-9|pages=4–}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Tell Sakka==
'''Tell Sakka''' is a man-made [[Tell (archaeology)|tell]] in the neighborhood that has been excavated by [[Ahmed Taraqji]] on behalf of the [[Directorate-General of Antiquities and Museums]].&lt;ref&gt;Taraqji, A., "Nouvelles decouvertes sur les relations avec 1'Egypte a Tell Sakka et a Keswe, dans la region de Damas," Bulletin de la Societe Francaise d'Egyptologie 144:27-43, 1999.&lt;/ref&gt;

Remains of a palace was found and dated to between 1800 and 1600 BCE.

The first [[cuneiform]] tablet recovered in the Damascus area was found at Tell Sakka. It was suggested resemble the style of cuneiform found in the archives of [[Mari, Syria|Mari]] and speaks of a king called [[Zimri-Lim]]. The cuneiform tablet in Sakka was translated to read ''"To my brother Zimri-lim, say "Thus saith Kanhilesu? Your brothers Samas and Dagan for the rest of the days, My brother sustenance? In front of me (it is) good. In front of my brother that is well! I heard: The enemy of my country brother, My brother has attacked, news of him that sent me! (...) inside a (?)

The '''Sea Organization''' ('''Sea Org''') is a [[Scientology]] organization, which the [[Church of Scientology]] describes as a "[[fraternal organization|fraternal]] [[religious order]], comprising the church's most dedicated members".&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.scientology.org/faq/church-management/what-is-the-sea-organization.html |title=WHAT IS THE SEA ORGANIZATION?  |website=Church of Scientology International |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; All Scientology management organizations are controlled exclusively by members of the Sea Org.&lt;ref name="nrmarlia2003"&gt;{{cite book | last1 =  Davis | first1 = Derek | last2 = Hankins | first2 = Barry | year = 2003 | title = New Religious Movements and Religious Liberty in America  | url = | publisher = Baylor University Press | location = |isbn = 0918954924|page=48-49}}&lt;/ref&gt; [[David Miscavige]], the ''de facto'' leader of Scientology, is the highest-ranking Sea Org officer, holding the rank of captain.

The Sea Org has been described as a [[paramilitary]] organization&lt;ref name="Cooper, 2 December 2005"&gt;Stark and Bainbridge 1996, p. 213.
*Dawson 2006, p. 38: "Members of the paramilitary Sea Org sign billion-year contracts of absolute loyalty and service to the highest leadership of the Church of Scientology."
*Former member Aaron Judge in Squires, 29 November 2009: "The Sea Org is like a military  organization. You live in cramped quarters, are served food in the cafeteria area and you basically work from 8:30 in the morning through to 11:15 at night."
*Former Scientology auditor Bruce Hines in [http://edition.cnn.com/TRANSCRIPTS/0512/02/acd.01.html Cooper, 2 December 2005]: "It's very much a military organization. You wear a uniform, there's saluting, marching, standing at attention."&lt;/ref&gt; and as a private naval force,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |title=Farce and fear in Scientology's private navy [extract from "Bare-Faced Messiah: The True Story of L. Ron Hubbard"]  |author=[[Russell Miller]] |url=http://www.xenu-directory.net/news/images/thecompiler-1987-31.pdf |newspaper=[[The Sunday Times]] |date=15 November 1987 |accessdate=8 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; having operated several vessels in its past and displaying a maritime tradition. Some ex-members and scholars have described the Sea Org as a [[totalitarian]] organization marked by intensive surveillance and a lack of freedom.&lt;ref name=Urban124/&gt; The Sea Org has also been compared to a [[monastic]] organization.&lt;ref name=melton&gt;{{cite journal |title=A Contemporary Ordered Religious Community: The Sea Org Organization |journal=The Journal of CESNUR |year=2018 |last=Melton |first=J. Gordon |volume=2 |issue=2 |issn=2532-2990 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

In a 1992 memorandum by the [[Church of Scientology International]], the following information was provided to the [[Internal Revenue Service]] with regards to nature of the Sea Org:&lt;ref&gt;[https://www.scribd.com/document/267513033/Church-of-Scientology-Nov-23-1992-Third-Set-of-Responses-to-the-IRS Church of Scientology, Nov. 23, 1992: Third Set of Responses to the IRS in support of Scientology's application for 501(c)(3) tax exemption.]&lt;/ref&gt;

&lt;blockquote&gt; [the Sea Org] does not have an ecclesiastical organizing board or command channels chart or secular existence such as an incorporated or unincorporated association. [...] Although there is no such "organization" as the Sea Organization, the term Sea Org has a colloquial usage which implies that there is. There are general recruitment posters and literature for "The Sea Org" which implies that people will be employed by the Sea Org when in reality they will join, making the billion year commitment, at some church that is staffed by Sea Org members and become employees of that church corporation. [...] The Sea Org exists as a spiritual commitment that is factually beyond the full understanding of the Service or any other but a trained and audited Scientologist.&lt;/blockquote&gt; 

The Sea Org was established on August 12, 1967 by [[L. Ron Hubbard]], the founder of [[Dianetics]] and [[Scientology]], initially on board four ships, the ''Diana'', the ''Athena'', the ''Apollo'', and the ''Excalibur''.

In 1971, the Sea Org assumed responsibility for the ecclesiastical development of the church, and in particular the delivery of the upper levels of its auditing and training, known as the [[Operating Thetan]] or "OT" levels.{{sfn | Melton| 2003 | pp= 44–47}} In 1981, under the aegis of the [[Commodore's Messenger Organization]] led by David Miscavige, the Sea Org dissolved the [[Office of Special Affairs#History|Guardian's Office]] (GO) and assumed full responsibility for the international management of the Church, later reassigning the duties of the GO to the [[Office of Special Affairs]] in 1983 during the corporate restructuring of the Church.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.xenu.net/archive/go/gohist.htm |title=Scientology's Secret Service 2.

==Background==
{{further|Scientology beliefs and practices|Space opera in Scientology}}
[[File:L. Ron Hubbard in 1950.jpg|thumb|200px|[[L. Ron Hubbard]] founded the [[Church of Scientology]] in 1953 and the Sea Org in 1967.]]

According to Hubbard, much of the galaxy, including Earth (known as "Teegeeack"), was ruled tens of millions of years ago by the Galactic Confederacy. The confederacy was controlled by a tyrant named [[Xenu]], who was eventually overthrown by a group within the Galactic Confederacy known as the "Loyal Officers". Religious scholar [[Hugh Urban]] writes that the Sea Org is modeled after these Loyal Officers. Urban also describes the Sea Org, with the naval uniforms and ranks, as an idealized re-creation of [[Military career of L. Ron Hubbard|Hubbard's own World War II military career]]. He also states that the Sea Org is reminiscent of the "Soldiers of Light" in Hubbard's science fiction story collection ''[[Ole Doc Methuselah]]''.&lt;ref name=Urban124/&gt; 

[[Stephen A. Kent]] (2001) argues that at least part of the reason for the establishment of the Sea Org was that the Church of Scientology's practices encountered resistance from the American [[Food and Drug Administration]] and the IRS, and from the governments of Australia, the United Kingdom, and Rhodesia. Sailing on the high seas meant the church could escape their attention.&lt;ref&gt;Kent 2001, pp. 111–112, footnote 23.&lt;/ref&gt;

In 2000 the number of Sea Org members was listed at around 7,000.{{sfn | Melton| 2003 | p= }} As of 2009, the number was listed by the church at around 5,000.&lt;ref name="scnfaqso"/&gt; Most Sea Org members reside in church complexes in Los Angeles, Clearwater, Copenhagen, London, Saint Hill, and Sydney, with some at smaller centers or on assignment elsewhere.{{sfn | Melton| 2003 | p= }}

According to scholar Susan Raine, Hubbard created the Sea Org as a "kind of space navy, melding SF space ideas with Earthbound naval ones." Hubbard biographist Jon Atack recalled a confidential command within Sea Org that claimed that governments of the world were on the verge of collapse. "The Sea Org would survive and pick up the pieces."&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |last=Kent |first1=Stephen A. |last2=Raine |first2=Susan |title=Scientology in Popular Culture: Influences and Struggles for Legitimacy |location=Santa Barbara, California |publisher=ABC-CLIO |year=2017 |isbn=978-1-4408-3249-9 }}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Structure==

===Estates Project Force===
All new recruits are required to complete compulsory [[novitiate]] before they are allowed to join the Sea Org, which has been described as a [[Recruit training|boot camp]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web |url=http://www.thedailybeast.com/articles/2012/07/06/scientology-s-sea-org-an-escape-story-for-katie-holmes-and-suri-cruise.html |title=Scientology’s Sea Org: A Story of Escape for Katie Holmes and Suri Cruise |author=Abigail Pesta |website=[[The Daily Beast]] |publisher=Newsweek/The Daily Beast LLC}}&lt;/ref&gt; During this phase, recruits are not yet considered to be Sea Org members, and are required to address all Sea Org members, regardless of rank, as "sir" as well as having to run everywhere instead of walking.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite journal|last1=Kent|first1=Stephen A.|title=Brainwashing in Scientology's Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF)|date=September 13, 2000|publisher=Interior Ministry, University of Alberta}}&lt;/ref&gt; Married couples are separated for the duration of the EPF and are not allowed to have private or intimate contact with each other.

While on the EPF, recruits perform five hours of manual labor every day, in addition to a five-hour study period that consists of studying several Scientology courses, including the ''Basic Study Manual'', an introductory course in [[study tech]], ''Introduction to Scientology Ethics'', a basic course in [[Ethics (Scientology)|Scientology ethics]], as well as courses concerning the history of the Sea Org and personal hygiene and grooming. Like the RPF, the EPF does not have a definite schedule. A recruit graduates the EPF as soon as all the required courses have been completed and upon successfully undergoing a mandatory security check, they are then allowed to join the Sea Org as full members.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book |author= Stephen A. Kent |date=13 September 2000 |title=Brainwashing in Scientology's Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF) |publisher=Interior Ministry - Behörde für Inneres — Arbeitsgruppe Scientology und Landeszentrale fuür politische Bildung |url=http://www.solitarytrees.net/pubs/skent/brain.htm |accessdate=10 July 2013}}&lt;/ref&gt; Sea Org recruits verbally agree to an 18-point code or pledge as part of a swearing in ceremony. Members formally reaffirm their acceptance of this code annually on August 12, the day when the organization was founded.{{sfn | Melton| 2003 | p= }}

===Location===
[[File:Freewinds starboard.jpg|thumb|200px|The church's cruise ship, the ''[[Freewinds]]'', staffed by Sea Org members]]

In 1967 the Church of Scientology purchased [[HMS Royal Scotsman|HMS ''Royal Scotsman'']] which they renamed the ''Apollo'',  which was used as the Sea Org's [[Flagship]]. In 1975, the church sold the Sea Org's ships and moved the organization to land bases around the world, which as of 2003, were operating in Clearwater, Copenhagen, London, Los Angeles, [[Saint Hill Manor]] in the UK, and Sydney, with smaller offices in Budapest, Johannesburg, Madrid, Milan, Moscow, and Toronto.{{sfn | Melton| 2003 | p= }} In 1987, they purchased a ship, ''La Bohème'', which they renamed ''[[Freewinds]]''. [[OT VIII]], the highest auditing level of Scientology currently available, is exclusive to the ''Freewinds'' and can only be undertaken there. The ship also hosts various courses, seminars, conventions and events throughout the year, including the annual ''Maiden Voyage'' celebration.&lt;ref name="slate2011"&gt;{{cite news|url=http://www.slate.com/articles/news_and_politics/explainer/2011/12/valeska_paris_and_the_scientology_cruise_ship_what_happens_onboard_.html|title=What Do You Do on a Scientology Cruise Ship?|author=Brian Palmer|publisher=''[[Slate (magazine)]]''|date=December 1, 2011|accessdate=May 29, 2015}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;For an example of the latter, see Reitman 2011, p. 284.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Billion-year commitment===
According to Hubbard, the Sea Org's mission is "an exploration into both time ''and'' space".&lt;ref name=Urban124&gt;Urban 2011, pp. 124–127.&lt;/ref&gt; Sea Org members act as goodwill representatives and administrators of Scientology; all policy and administrative posts in the church's key organizations are held by Sea Org members.{{sfn | Melton| 2003 | p= }} Most members are given room, board and a weekly allowance of about $75.&lt;ref name="St. Petersburg Times"&gt;[http://www.sptimes.com/2004/07/18/Tampabay/About_Scientology.shtml ''St. Petersburg Times'', 18 July 2004].
*[http://www.latimes.com/news/local/la-scientology062690,0,425562,full.story Welkos and Sappell, 26 June 1990].&lt;/ref&gt;

In accordance with [[Scientology beliefs and practices|Scientology beliefs]], members are expected to return to the Sea Org when they are reborn; the Sea Org's motto is "We Come Back".&lt;ref name=Atack175&gt;Atack 1990, p. 175.&lt;/ref&gt; Members must therefore sign a symbolic billion-year "religious commitment", pledging to "get [[Ethics (Scientology)|ethics]] in on this planet and the universe."{{sfn | Melton| 2003 | p= 51-52}} The church contends that the agreement is not a legally binding contract and is merely a symbolic demonstration of the dedication members are expected to give to the organization, and that they are free to leave if they wish. After signing, members report to the Estates Project Force, the Sea Org's induction program; Melton writes that members may take several years between signing the commitment and attending the induction. Once induction is completed, the final decision to join is made.{{sfn | Melton| 2003 | p= 50}}

Members who leave the Sea Org are issued a "freeloader's bill", retroactively billing them for any auditing or training they have received. Although the bill is not legally enforceable, these Scientologists may not receive services at any Scientology organization until they pay the bill and perform an ethics course.&lt;ref&gt;[https://web.archive.org/web/20110604102718/http://www.sptimes.com/2006/06/24/Tampabay/The_unperson.shtml Farley, 24 June 2006], pp. 1A, 14A.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Marriage and family===
{{further|Scientology and abortion}}
From the early 1970s to the start of the 21st century, the children of Sea Org members were often placed in the [[Cadet Org]]. Sea Org members may marry one another, but are not permitted to marry outside the organization; extra-marital sex is also prohibited. According to Melton, couples with children must leave the Sea Org and return to other staff positions within the church until the child is six years old; thereafter the children are raised communally and allowed to visit their parents in the Sea Org on weekends. Children of members have themselves joined the Sea Org when they came of age.{{sfn | Melton| 2003 | p= 53}} Several former members have said they were advised (or even forced) to have an [[abortion]] when they became pregnant to avoid being sent to lower organizations. Scientology presents itself as opposed to abortion and actively speaks out against it in its publications.&lt;ref name="St. Petersburg Times"/&gt;&lt;ref&gt;Kent 1999. *[http://exscientologykids.com/sea-org-2/ "The Sea Org / Cadet Org"], Ex Scientology Kids, accessed 17 August 2015.&lt;/ref&gt;

===Rehabilitation Project Force===
{{further|Rehabilitation Project Force}}
The Rehabilitation Project Force (RPF) was created in January 1974 as a system of work camps set up by the Sea Org, intended to isolate and rehabilitate members who have not lived up to the church's expectations, have failed [[List of Scientology Security Checks|security checks]], or have violated certain policies. Melton writes that the RPF areas are located within Sea Org facilities, and that there are no locks on the doors.{{sfn | Melton| 2003 | p= 57}}

Many ex-Sea Org members have reported gruelling treatment. According to Melton, there are eight hours of physical work&amp;nbsp;– such as painting, plumbing, and upkeep of grounds&amp;nbsp;– six days a week; the work may involve teaching the member a skill such as carpentry. Members also spend five hours a day studying with or auditing a partner.{{sfn | Melton| 2003 | p= 57}} Former Scientologist Jon Atack argued, in ''[[A Piece of Blue Sky]]'' (1990), that treatment of Sea Org members in the RPF was a "careful imitation of techniques long-used by the military to obtain unquestioning obedience and immediate compliance to orders, or more simply to break men's spirits&amp;nbsp;..."&lt;ref name=Atack206/&gt; One former member, [[Gerry Armstrong (activist)|Gerry Armstrong]], said that during his time in the Sea Org in the 1970s he spent over two years banished to the RPF as a punishment:

&lt;blockquote&gt;It was essentially a prison to which crew who were considered nonproducers, security risks, or just wanted to leave the Sea Org, were assigned. Hubbard's RPF policies established the conditions.  RPF members were segregated and not allowed to communicate to anyone else. They had their own spaces and were not allowed in normal crew areas of the ship. They ate after normal crew had eaten, and only whatever was left over from the crew meal. Their berthing was the worst on board, in a roach-infested, filthy and unventilated cargo hold. They wore black boilersuits, even in the hottest weather. They were required to run everywhere. Discipline was harsh and bizarre, with running laps of the ship assigned for the slightest infraction like failing to address a senior with "Sir." Work was hard and the schedule rigid with seven hours' sleep time from lights out to lights on, short meal breaks, no liberties and no free time&amp;nbsp;...&lt;p&gt;When one young woman ordered into the RPF took the assignment too lightly, Hubbard created the RPF's RPF and assigned her to it, an even more degrading experience, cut off even from the RPF, kept under guard, forced to clean the ship's [[bilge]]s, and allowed even less sleep.&lt;ref name=Atack206&gt;Atack 1990, p. 206.&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;/blockquote&gt;

==Analysis==
Several scholars, writers and former members have compared the Sea Org to a paramilitary group.&lt;ref name="Cooper, 2 December 2005"/&gt; In ''[[Tom Cruise: An Unauthorized Biography]]'' (2008), [[Andrew Morton (writer)|Andrew Morton]] described it as a "fraternal paramilitary organization", and wrote that members are instructed to read ''[[The Art of War]]'' by warfare expert [[Sun Tzu]], and ''[[On War]]'' by General [[Carl von Clausewitz]]. He wrote that Scientology leader [[David Miscavige]] created an elite unit within the Sea Org called the "SEALs", named after the [[United States Navy SEALs]], who receive better lodging, sustenance, and uniforms than other Sea Org members.&lt;ref name="morton"&gt;Morton 2008, pp. 126, 135–137.&lt;/ref&gt;

[[Lawrence Wright]] wrote in ''The New Yorker'' in 2011 that the Sea Org used small children drawn from Scientology families for what the article described as forced child labor. The article described extremely inhumane conditions, with children spending years in the Sea Org, sequestered from mainstream life.&lt;ref name=Wright/&gt;

'''Shaddād''' ([[Arabic]]  '''شدّاد'''), also known as Shaddād bin 'Ad, was believed to be the king of the lost [[Arabian]] city of [[Iram of the Pillars]], an account of which is mentioned in [[Sura 89]] of the [[Qur'an]]. Various sources suggest Shaddad was the son of 'Ad al-Miltat ibn Saksak ibn Wa'il ibn Himyar.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite book|url=|title=Al-Bayan Wa L-Bunyan: Meaning, Poetics, and Politics in Early Islamic Architecture|last=Alami|first=Mohammed Hamdouni|date=2001|publisher=University of California, Berkeley|year=|isbn=|location=|pages=238|language=en}}&lt;/ref&gt;

His story is found in the 277th through 279th nights of the ''Tales of the Arabian Nights'' ''([[The Book of One Thousand and One Nights]])''.

Brothers Shaddīd (شديد) and Shaddād are said to have reigned in turn over the 1,000 Adite tribes, each consisting of several thousand men. It is said Shaddad brutally subdued all Arabia and [[Iraq]]. Many Arab writers tell of an expedition of Shaddād that caused the [[Canaan]]ite migration, their settling in Syria, and the Shepherd invasion of Egypt. 

According to the [[Quran]], [[Iram of the Pillars]] was a city of occult worshippers of stone idols, who defied the warnings of the prophet [[Hud (prophet)|Hud]]. To punish them, God sent a drought. But the people would not repent, so they were destroyed by a furious wind, from which only Hud and a few believers emerged.

'''"Shambala"''' is a song written by [[Daniel Moore (Musician)|Daniel Moore]] and made famous by two near-simultaneous releases in 1973: the better-known but slightly later recording by [[Three Dog Night]], which reached number 3 on the [[Billboard Hot 100]], and a version by [[B.W.

The well-known cover of this song by the [[rock music|rock]] band [[Three Dog Night]] appeared in 1973 on the ''Billboard'' Hot 100, on the top 40 from the beginning of June through the end of August, reaching #3 in both the [[pop music|pop singles]] and [[adult contemporary]] categories,&lt;ref name="all"/&gt; #1 on the ''[[Cashbox (magazine)|Cashbox]] Magazine'' charts,&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://50.6.195.142/archives/70s_files/19730728.html|title=Top 100|publisher=Cash Box|date=1973-07-21|accessdate=2013-09-02|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20150219102649/http://50.6.195.142/archives/70s_files/19730728.html|archivedate=2015-02-19|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; and an isolated week at #1 on [[WLS (AM)|WLS]].&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.users.qwest.net/~oldiesloon/wls072373.htm|title=WLS 890 Hit Parade|website=Users.qwest.net|date=1973-07-23|accessdate=2012-07-22|deadurl=yes|archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20110806080336/http://www.users.qwest.net/~oldiesloon/wls072373.htm|archivedate=2011-08-06|df=}}&lt;/ref&gt; Headed toward the Hot 100's summit in late July, had it not run out of steam, “Shambala” would have completed an uncommon distinction of a Hot 100 chart-topper for each of four consecutive years for the group.  The song, the first one that the group had specifically cut as a single, rather than an album cut,&lt;ref&gt;[[Casey Kasem]], "[[American Top 40]]", 9 June 1973&lt;/ref&gt; later appeared on ''[[Cyan (Three Dog Night album)|Cyan]],'' Three Dog Night's ninth [[album]], and subsequently on numerous [[anthology|anthologies]] and compilation albums.&lt;ref name="all"/&gt;&lt;ref name="lastfm"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.last.fm/music/Three+Dog+Night/_/Shambala |title=Three Dog Night — Shambala — Listen, watch, download and discover music for free at |website=Last.fm |date= |accessdate=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Although the lyrics of “Shambala” draw on a [[Theme (music)|theme]] from [[Eastern mysticism]], ''[[Allmusic]]'' notes the "very strong [[Gospel music|gospel]] feeling" of the album ''Cyan'' is most evident on this song. This comment may be based on both the instrumentation, including the characteristic gospel [[Keyboard instrument|keyboard]] [[Organ (music)|organ]] sounds that accompany the chorus, which features the repeated, unmistakable dog howls for which the group was long famous, and the [[blues music|bluesy]] vocals of [[Cory Wells]]. ''Allmusic'' calls this hit single "one of the group's finest later period records."&lt;ref name="all"/&gt;

==B. W. Stevenson version==
One week before Three Dog Night's version appeared on the charts, [[Texas|Texan]] [[singer-songwriter]] [[B. W. Stevenson]]'s minute-shorter version bowed at #96 and later peaked at #66 during its eight-week run.&lt;ref name="all"&gt;{{cite web|author=Matthew Greenwald |url=http://www.allmusic.com/album/cyan-mw0000203947 |title=Cyan - Three Dog Night &amp;#124; Songs, Reviews, Credits |publisher=[[AllMusic]] |date= |accessdate=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="dan"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.djmrec.com/djm/index.html |title=DJM Records- Daniel Moore |website=Djmrec.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;As Stevenson was a songwriter himself, and had jointly written and composed the top-ten hit "[[My Maria]]" with Moore, some sources erroneously list Stevenson as the writer or co-writer of “Shambala.” Incidentally, some sources either recognize musical similarities between these two songs or refute those that do.&lt;/ref&gt; It also reached #31 on the U.S. Adult Contemporary chart.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite book|first= Joel |last= Whitburn |authorlink= Joel Whitburn |year= 1993 |title= Top Adult Contemporary: 1961–1993 |publisher= Record Research |page=229}}&lt;/ref&gt; This lesser-known version is often regarded as [[country pop]] or [[country rock]] and appears on collections of such. The [[twang]] of Stevenson's [[steel-string acoustic guitar]], his [[Southern American English|Southern accent]] and an [[American folk music]] sound all distinguish it from the better-known version soon to follow.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.napathon.net/Country1.php |title=Country &amp; Country-Rock Collection: Page 1 |website=Napathon.net |date=1949-10-05 |accessdate=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt; In South Africa, Stevenson's version actually charted higher, peaking at #8, compared to Three Dog Night's #13.

==Lyrics==
The song's actual lyrics are about the [[Mythology|myth]]ical [[monarchy|kingdom]] of [[Shambhala]], which was said to be hidden somewhere within or beyond the peaks of the [[Himalayas]] and was mentioned in various ancient texts, including the [[Kalachakra|Kalachakra Tantra]] and ancient texts of [[Tibetan Buddhism]].&lt;ref name="myths"&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.berzinarchives.com/kalachakra/mistaken_foreign_myths_shambhala.html |title=Mistaken Foreign Myths about Shambhala — Study Buddhism |website=Berzinarchives.com |date= |accessdate=2016-10-08}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The lyrics refer to a situation where [[kindness]] and [[cooperation]] are universal, [[joy]] and [[luck|good fortune]] abound, and [[psychological]] burdens are lifted.

The phrases "in the halls of Shambala" and "on the road to Shambala" tie for number of occurrences in the lyrics. The latter phrase perhaps alludes to the idea of Shambala not as a physical place but as a [[metaphor]] for the spiritual path one might follow.&lt;ref name="myths"/&gt;

'''''Sister Wives''''' is an American [[reality television]] series broadcast on [[TLC (TV network)|TLC]] that premiered on September 26, 2010. The show documents the life of a [[Mormonism and polygamy|polygamist]] family, which includes patriarch Kody Brown, his four wives, and their 18 children. The family began the series living in [[Lehi, Utah|Lehi]], [[Utah]], but has since moved to [[Las Vegas Valley|Las Vegas]], [[Nevada]] in 2011, and  the unincorporated township of Baderville, Arizona, (northwest of [[Flagstaff, Arizona]]) in mid-2018.&lt;ref&gt;https://nextdoor.com/neighborhood/fortvalleybaderville--flagstaff--az/&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;https://azdailysun.com/news/local/tlc-s-sister-wives-have-moved-to-flagstaff-for-real/article_edc4cbd1-87b5-5ec3-ac4f-3668fe5eef25.html&lt;/ref&gt;

Brown and his four wives have stated they participated in the show to make the public more aware of polygamist families and to combat societal prejudices. Brown believes his polygamist arrangement is legal because he is legally married only to one woman, and the other marriages are spiritual unions. The series led to the Brown family being investigated for possible prosecution. This resulted in a federal judge declaring Utah laws that guard against polygamy to be unconstitutional; citing that state may still outlaw [[Mormonism and polygamy|plural marriages]], but it cannot prohibit polygamous [[cohabitation]].&lt;ref&gt;https://www.polygamy.com/articles/85705247/when-one-wife-isn-t-enough-the-problems-of-polygamy&lt;/ref&gt;

Meri, Robyn, and Christine were all raised in polygamist families, but Janelle was not. Although Christine's mother left the faith she still supports them. Months before the marriage of Janelle and Kody, however, Janelle's mother entered into a polygamist marriage with Kody's father.&lt;ref name="Fralic" /&gt; The Brown family belonged to the [[Apostolic United Brethren]] (AUB).  For years before the series, the family kept their polygamist lifestyle what they called a "quasi-secret".&lt;ref name="Horiuchi"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Horiuchi |first=Vince |title=Utah polygamists star in reality TV show |work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |date=August 6, 2010 |url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/home/50067634-76/wives-family-sister-brown.html.csp |accessdate=September 28, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

==Development==
In the autumn of 2009, independent producers Timothy Gibbons and Christopher Poole approached Figure 8 Films, a [[North Carolina|North Carolinian]] company, with the concept of a reality series about the Brown family. Bill Hayes, the president of Figure 8 Films, said the company agreed to the idea after meeting with the Browns and deciding their lives would make a great story. Camera crews shot footage of the family in mid-2010 to be used in the first season,&lt;ref name="Horiuchi" /&gt; ending in May with the marriage of Kody Brown and Robyn Sullivan.&lt;ref name="Belloni"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Belloni |first=Matthew |title=Bigamy investigation threatens TLC's "Sister Wives" |work=[[Reuters]] |date=October 7, 2010 |url=https://www.reuters.com/article/idUSTRE6960S420101007 |accessdate=October 18, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; The crews continued to film them afterward in case the series was picked up for a second season. ''Sister Wives'' was publicly introduced on August 6, 2010, at the [[Television Critics Association]] summer media tour in [[Beverly Hills, California|Beverly Hills]], [[California]]. The series' first episode, an hour long, was broadcast on [[TLC (TV channel)|TLC]] on September 26, 2010, and the first season continued with six half-hour chapters until October 17, 2010.&lt;ref name="Horiuchi" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Ep4Rate" /&gt;

The broadcast of ''Sister Wives'' came at a time that polygamy and multiple marriages were a prevalent topic in American pop culture. ''[[Big Love]]'', the hit [[HBO]] series about fictional Utah polygamist Bill Henrickson, his three sister wives, and their struggle to gain acceptance in society, had already been on the air for several years. In early September 2010, the drama series ''[[Lone Star (TV series)|Lone Star]]'', about a con man on the verge of entering into multiple marriages, premiered on [[Fox Broadcasting Company|Fox]] but was quickly canceled after two episodes, and when ''Sister Wives'' debuted, actress [[Katherine Heigl]] was in the process of developing a film about [[Carolyn Jessop]], a woman who fled from a polygamist [[sect]].&lt;ref name="Freydkin"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Freydkin |first=Donna |title=Unfamiliar world of polygamy is opening up in TV shows, films |work=[[USA Today]] |date=September 26, 2010 |url=https://www.usatoday.com/life/television/news/2010-09-27-polygamy27_ST_N.htm |accessdate=September 27, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

In October 2010, TLC announced it had commissioned a second season, which began in March 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=Pierce |first=Scott D. |title=TLC renews 'Sister Wives' |work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |date=October 29, 2010 |url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/news/50568032-78/wives-tlc-kody-sister.html.csp |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; A TLC interview with the Brown family was broadcast on October 31, 2010,&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite news |last=Means |first=Sean P. |title=Spend Halloween with the "Sister Wives" |work=[[The Salt Lake Tribune]] |date=October 22, 2010 |url=http://www.sltrib.com/sltrib/blogs/vulture/50525311-56/halloween-oct-season-sister.html.csp |accessdate=October 30, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt; and a one-hour program featuring the honeymoon of Kody Brown and Robyn Sullivan aired on November 22, 2010.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite news |last=France |first=Lisa Respers |title=A 'Sister Wives' honeymoon special |publisher=CNN |date=November 20, 2010 |url=http://marquee.blogs.cnn.com/2010/11/20/a-sister-wives-honeymoon-special/ |accessdate=November 29, 2010}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The season premiere introduced viewers to Kody Brown and his three wives, Meri, Janelle, and Christine, and their twelve children, all of whom lived in a ranch-style home with three interconnected apartments.&lt;ref name="Stuever" /&gt;&lt;ref name="Perigard" /&gt; It also chronicled Kody's dating and engagement to Robyn Sullivan, who herself has three children, marking the first time in 16 years Kody had courted another wife.&lt;ref name="Shellnutt1130"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Shellnutt |first=Kate |title=Sister Wives: Growing pains |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |date=October 3, 2010 |url=http://blogs.chron.com/tubular/archives/2010/10/sister_wives_gr.html |accessdate=November 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101202003344/http://blogs.chron.com/tubular/archives/2010/10/sister_wives_gr.html |archivedate=December 2, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; The new relationship creates insecurity and jealousy among the other three wives, but they ultimately accept her and welcome her into the family.&lt;ref name="Shellnutt1010"&gt;{{Cite news |last=Shellnutt |first=Kate |title=Sister Wives: Baby mama drama |date=October 10, 2010 |work=[[Houston Chronicle]] |url=http://blogs.chron.com/tubular/archives/2010/10/sister_wives_ba.html |accessdate=November 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101122212448/http://blogs.chron.com/tubular/archives/2010/10/sister_wives_ba.html |archivedate=November 22, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; During the fourth episode of the season, Christine gives birth to her sixth child, {{Not a typo|Truely}}, which brings the family to 16 children including Robyn's three kids.&lt;ref name="Shellnutt1010"/&gt;

Later, Kody and Meri go to [[Mexico]] to celebrate their twentieth wedding anniversary, where Meri discussed her sadness about her infertility problems and the jealousy that has arisen from Kody's engagement to Robyn. Kody proposes [[in vitro fertilisation]], but she turns down the idea as she is only interested in a naturally occurring conception.&lt;ref name="Shellnutt1010" /&gt; As Robyn's wedding approaches, the three sister wives help Robyn prepare, and they begin to bond. However, Kody upsets his wives when he reveals he secretly chose Robyn's wedding dress himself, which makes Christine feel so betrayed that she angrily walks away in mid-interview. Kody eventually apologizes, and the five reconcile.&lt;ref name="Shellnutt1130" /&gt; The first-season finale ends with the wedding of Kody and Robyn, where Meri, Janelle, and Christine present her with a [[Claddagh ring]] to welcome her into the family.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|last=Reiher |first=Andrea |title='Sister Wives' finale: Will Season 2 see Robyn move into the house? |work=[[Zap2it]] |date=October 17, 2010 |url=http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/10/sister-wives-finale-will-season-2-see-robyn-move-into-the-house.html |accessdate=November 29, 2010 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20101212055644/http://blog.zap2it.com/frominsidethebox/2010/10/sister-wives-finale-will-season-2-see-robyn-move-into-the-house.html |archivedate=December 12, 2010 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt;

===Season 2===
Season 2 ran 23 episodes from March 13, 2011 to November 27, 2011, though many sources refer to the episodes airing from September 25, 2011 to November 27, 2011 as Season 3. This is due to a short hiatus from June 5, 2011 to September 25, 2011.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/tvshows/sister-wives/episodes-season-2/306751 |title=Sister Wives Episodes&amp;nbsp;– Sister Wives Full Episode Guides from Season 2 on TLC |publisher=TVGuide.com |date= |accessdate=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Season 2 begins with the Browns heading to New York to appear on national television for the first time as open polygamists, while back home the kids head off to their first day of public school. Throughout the season, the Browns visit various friends and family members and reflect on how their relationships have changed with these people since they became open polygamists. These friends and family members include Kody's parents (also polygamists), Kody's high school friends, and various monogamous couples that Kody and the sister wives know. Part 1 of Season 2 also follows the Browns through Kody and Janelle's anniversary camping trip, preparing and participating in Halloween, and Christmas, which the Browns celebrate in a snowy mountain cabin. During Season 2 we also learn more about Meri's personal struggle with her risk of cancer and the loss of her sister. In episode 5, Kody, Christine, and their children take a trip to Las Vegas, which we later learn is the beginning of the Browns' subsequent move to Las Vegas. The final episodes of Season 2 follow the Browns with their real estate agent Mona Riekki through their struggle to find a home in Las Vegas suitable for polygamists, telling the kids that they are moving, and the subsequent move to Las Vegas. Realtor, Mona Riekki finds rental homes for each of the wives and Kody. Once the Browns settle into their new homes they discuss the possibility of finding a home for all of them to live together or four homes in one cul-de-sac. In the last episode before the hiatus, Robyn announces that she is expecting her and Kody's first child.&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.tvguide.com/News/Sister-Wives-Baby-1031670.aspx |title=Sister Wives' Kody and Robyn Brown Expecting&amp;nbsp;– Today's News: Our Take |publisher=TVGuide.com |date=April 10, 2011 |accessdate=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt;

The second part of Season 2 brings the announcement of the sex of Robyn and Kody's baby and the Browns' struggle to adjust to life in Las Vegas. The episodes following the Season 2 hiatus focus largely on Robyn's pregnancy and the kids' adjustment to their new lives. The abrupt move to Las Vegas brings about behavioral problems in some of the older kids, which is also discussed largely in the second half of Season 2. During these episodes the Browns also explore possible businesses that the five of them (Kody and the sister wives) can run together. Several episodes after the hiatus discuss specific topics such as jealousy among the sister wives, especially regarding courting a new wife, how the parents combat the influence of Las Vegas on their children, and how the Browns are preparing the older children for college. Mona Riekki is back in this season and is working with the family on finding a permanent home in Vegas. In the finale, Robyn gives birth to baby Solomon on October 27, 2011&lt;ref&gt;{{cite web|url=http://www.eonline.com/news/meet_solomon_brown_first_photo_of/271958 |title=Meet Solomon Brown First Photo Of Newest Sister Wives Baby |publisher=E! Online |date=October 27, 2011 |accessdate=November 21, 2012}}&lt;/ref&gt; and the possibility of Meri having more children once again resurfaces.

Although the ongoing investigation of the Browns is brought up during Season 2, it is not extensively discussed, and the progress of the investigation is unknown.

===Season 3===
Season 3 premiered on May 13, 2012 after vague details surfaced about the show's spring return on the Twitter account of sister wife Robyn Sullivan Brown. The twenty one episode season mainly dealt with the family's inability to be a cohesive unit while living in four separate homes. Meri explains more about the infertility problems she has experienced, while Christine discloses more on her jealousy of Robyn. The season returned from hiatus on November 18, 2012, to the Brown family still discussing their options into moving their family onto one property, and invest in a cul-de-sac where they can build four homes. It is more evident this season that living in separate homes is tearing the family apart. Towards the end of the season, the family plans a three-day trip to [[Nauvoo, Illinois]], the birthplace of American polygamy. In the last episode on December 30, 2012, the family also deals with the upcoming departure to college of the eldest Brown child, Logan.

===Season 4===
Season 4 premiered on July 21, 2013.&lt;ref name=season4&gt;{{cite web|last=Kondolojy |first=Amanda |title='Sister Wives' Returns for a Fourth Season on TLC |url=http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/07/02/sister-wives-returns-for-a-fourth-season-on-tlc/190033/ |work=TV by the Numbers |accessdate=July 29, 2013 |date=July 2, 2013 |deadurl=yes |archiveurl=https://web.archive.org/web/20130706182306/http://tvbythenumbers.zap2it.com/2013/07/02/sister-wives-returns-for-a-fourth-season-on-tlc/190033/ |archivedate=July 6, 2013 |df= }}&lt;/ref&gt; It chronicles the family as they move into four adjacent houses within the same neighborhood. The wives are still working on starting their jewelry business. Meri comes to a decision following Robyn's offer to be her surrogate.

===Season 5===

Season 5 includes seven episodes, eight if you include the "Tell All" at the end, and eleven if you include the "Sitting Down with the Browns", "Meri-Behind the Scenes", and the "Robyn-Behind the Scenes" episodes. Season 5 begins with two daughters, Mykelti and Madison,  graduating high school. The grown ups plan to lip sync a song to celebrate, but it brings out some negative feelings for Janelle, who is not comfortable being so outgoing and admits to being embarrassed in public by the others' behavior. And a deeper issue of feeling like she's not heard bubbles to the surface and she sees a therapist to discuss that along with her challenging relationship with first wife Meri. On a business level, the family discusses whether to turn down investors' money and keep full ownership of Sisterwives' Closet and whether to keep the products all their own creations or branch out and resale other artists' designs and products.
Christine's mother moves in with her in Las Vegas, and in episode four, the Browns allow two anthropologists to live with them for two days to see the inner workings of polygamy, an arrangement that could either put their lifestyle in a positive or negative light.

Finally, after five years of mental deliberation, Meri files for legal divorce from Kody so Kody can adopt Robyn's three children from her previous marriage. By the end of the season, Meri and Kody maintained that they would continue their relationship.

===Season 6===
===Season 7=== 
Episode one picks up with the Brown Family after the marriage anniversary/ spiritual celebration. The first episode talks about Kody and Janelles upcoming wedding anniversary, Kody’s Birthday and the Sister Wives Closet meeting with investors. The second episodes delves a little bit deeper into the Sister Wives closet VS. potential investors idea- tank is heavily focused on the “shark tank” like business the Brown’s are trying to pitch to investors. In the previous episode Meri dropped the bombshell to Robyn that she was going back to college. Robyn states that she was annoyed and felt betrayed because Meri was the only wife who was 100% devoted to the business.

Mark A. Perigard of the ''[[Boston Herald]]'' criticized Kody Brown for opening himself and his family up to potential criminal prosecution by appearing in the series, describing him as "a lawbreaker who is risking himself and the family he claims is so precious just to star in his own TV show".&lt;ref name="Perigard" /&gt; Elizabeth Tenety of ''[[The Washington Post]]'' called the series "one part domestic drudgery, another part sensationalism" and claimed it relied on a "familiar reality TV recipe" shared by other TLC series such as ''[[19 Kids and Counting]]'' and ''[[Kate Plus 8]]''.&lt;ref name="Tenety" /&gt; ''[[Religion Dispatches]]'' writer [[Joanna Brooks]] shared Tenety's perspective, criticizing the show for presenting polygamy in a manner that "is about as interesting to me as [[Kate Gosselin]]'s latest makeover."

The '''Temple of Debod'''&lt;ref&gt;Other spellings: Debot, Debout, Dabod or Dabud&lt;/ref&gt; ({{lang-es|'''Templo de Debod'''}}) is an [[ancient Egypt]]ian [[Egyptian temple|temple]] that was dismantled and rebuilt in [[Madrid]], [[Spain]].
[[File:Francis Frith - The Temple of Dabod, Nubia.jpg|thumb|left|Temple of Debod in Egypt before relocation to Spain.]]
The shrine was originally erected {{convert|15|km}} south of [[Aswan]]&lt;ref name=arnold&gt;Dieter Arnold, Nigel Strudwick &amp; Sabine Gardiner, The Encyclopaedia of Ancient Egyptian Architecture, I.B. Tauris Publishers, 2003. p.64&lt;/ref&gt; in [[Upper Egypt]], very close to the first [[Cataracts of the Nile|cataract of the Nile]] and to the great religious center in [[Philae]] dedicated to the goddess [[Isis]]. In the early 2nd century BC, [[Adikhalamani]] (Tabriqo), the Kushite king of [[Meroë]], started its construction by building a small single-room [[chapel]] dedicated to the [[ancient Egyptian deities|god]] [[Amun]].&lt;ref name=arnold/&gt; It was built and decorated in a similar design to the later Meroitic chapel on which the [[Temple of Dakka]] is based.&lt;ref name=arnold/&gt; Later, during the reigns of [[Ptolemy VI]], [[Ptolemy VIII]], and [[Ptolemy XII]] of the [[Ptolemaic dynasty]], it was extended on all four sides to form a small temple, {{convert|12|x|15|m}}, which was dedicated to Isis of Philae. The [[Ancient Rome|Roman]] emperors [[Augustus]] and [[Tiberius]] completed its decorations.&lt;ref&gt;Dieter Arnold, Temples of the Last Pharaohs, Oxford University Press, 1999. p.193&lt;/ref&gt;

From the quay, there is a long processional way leading to the stone-built enclosure wall, through three stone pylon gateways, and finally to the temple itself.&lt;ref name=arnold/&gt; The pronaos, which had four columns with composite capitals, collapsed in 1868 and is now lost.&lt;ref name=arnold/&gt; Behind it lay the original sanctuary of Amun, the offering table room and a later sanctuary with several side-rooms and stairs to the roof.&lt;ref name=arnold/&gt;
[[File:Templo de Debod, Madrid, España, 2014-12-27, DD 03.JPG|thumb|left|The current Temple of Debod in Madrid.]]
In 1960, due to the construction of the [[Aswan Dam|Aswan High Dam]] and the consequent threat posed by its reservoir to numerous monuments and archeological sites, [[UNESCO]] made an international call to save this rich historical legacy.&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/172/ Monuments of Nubia-International Campaign to Save the Monuments of Nubia] World Heritage Committee, UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref&gt;[http://whc.unesco.org/en/activities/173/ The Rescue of Nubian Monuments and Sites], UNESCO&lt;/ref&gt; As a sign of gratitude for the help provided by Spain in saving the [[Abu Simbel temples]], the Egyptian state donated the temple of Debod to Spain in 1968.

The temple was rebuilt in one of Madrid's parks, the [[Parque del Oeste]], near the [[Royal Palace of Madrid]], and opened to the public in 1972.&lt;ref&gt;Arnold, Temples of the Last Pharaohs, p.193&lt;/ref&gt; The reassembled gateways have been placed in a different order than when originally erected. Compared to a photo of the original site, the gateway topped by a serpent-flanked sun was not the closest gateway to the temple proper.&lt;ref&gt;{{Cite web|url=https://digitalcollections.nypl.org/items/510d47d9-5ca3-a3d9-e040-e00a18064a99|title=The Temple of Dabod, Nubia|website=NYPL Digital Collections|language=en|access-date=2018-02-24}}&lt;/ref&gt; It constitutes one of the few works of [[ancient Egyptian architecture]] that can be seen outside Egypt and the only one of its kind in Spain.

The vast majority of groups termed "sects" by the Government were small organizations with fewer than 100 members. Among the larger groups present in Austria, are the Church of Scientology, with between 5,000 and 6,000 members, and the Unification Church, with approximately 700 adherents throughout the country. Other groups found in the country included Divine Light Mission, Eckankar, Hare Krishna, the Holosophic community, the Osho movement, Sahaja Yoga, Sai Baba, Sri Chinmoy, Transcendental Meditation, Landmark Education, the Center for Experimental Society Formation, Fiat Lux, Universal Life, and The Family.

==Organisation==
The founding of Universal Life was through teachings distributed by [[Gabriele Wittek]].&lt;ref name="religio"/&gt;&lt;ref name="nq"&gt;[http://www.lermanet.com/cisar/survey/nq.htm German Scientology News in Frankfurt, Germany&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; These works were claimed to be revelations from [[Jesus Christ]]&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; or other spiritual beings, which Gabriele received as a prophetess&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; and promulgated.&lt;ref name="mq"/&gt; These are, along with the [[Sermon on the Mount]] and the [[10 Commandments]], the fundamental basis of the faith. In 2003 Wittek published her own bible, ''Das ist mein Wort'' (''This is My Word'').&lt;ref name="wort"&gt;Gabriele Wittek:  Das ist mein Wort &amp;ndash; Alpha und Omega, das Evangelium Jesu.  {{ISBN|978-3-89201-153-8}}&lt;/ref&gt;

Members of Universal Life run, among other institutions, a school,&lt;ref name="who"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ilse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="np"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pere"&gt;[http://www.perefound.org/KIT6_97.html former Bruderhof members and residents KIT Newsletter June 1997 Volume IX #6&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; a natural healing clinic&lt;ref name="who"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ilse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="np"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pere"/&gt; and a publisher.&lt;ref name="np"/&gt; The beliefs of the group are propagated by Radio Santec GmbH of Marktheidenfeld through two TV stations, Die Neue Zeit TV and Sophia TV, transmitted from SES Astra 1KR satellite at the 19.2° East orbital position. They operate agricultural establishments,&lt;ref name="mq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="np"/&gt; which farm according to the principles of [[Organic farming]].&lt;ref name="mq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; However, these establishments are not officially connected to Universal Life.

==History==
Gabriele Wittek claims to have heard the first "inner words" after the death of her mother.&lt;ref name="who"/&gt;&lt;ref name="np"/&gt; After a year, she saw her dead mother appear during a spiritual meeting,&lt;ref name="who"/&gt; and spoke to her. Wittek claimed to have experienced several apparitions later, including of a spiritual being named "Brother Emmanuel".&lt;ref name="who"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ilse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="np"/&gt; Finally, she met Christ himself. On 18 April 1987 Christ allegedly spoke in a great revelation, among other things, about the "Inner Path".&lt;ref name="ilse"/&gt; It concerns a mystic school of thought in which God is considered to be in people and in all living beings, according to Jesus' saying: "The kingdom of God is 'within' you."

In the past, Universal Life claimed contact with an alien from outer space named Mairadi.&lt;ref name="Mairadi"&gt;{{Cite web |url=http://www.michelrieth.de/mairadi.htm |title=UFO-Mairadi&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt; |access-date=9 February 2007 |archive-url=https://web.archive.org/web/20070221072024/http://www.michelrieth.de/mairadi.htm |archive-date=21 February 2007 |dead-url=yes |df=dmy-all }}&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name="bq"&gt;[http://www.lermanet.com/cisar/survey/bq.htm German Scientology News in Berlin&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt;

==Adherents==
Exact numbers are hard to determine, since there is no formal membership within Universal Life. Georg Schmid estimated, in his book ''Churches, Sects, Religions'', the number of members to be 100,000 worldwide, including 40,000 in Germany.&lt;ref name="mq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="np"/&gt; Other estimates claim 10,000 members worldwide, with 3000 in the [[Würzburg]] region.

The association ''Universelles Leben e.V.'' has around 500 members. The inner circle, who live in communities in the Würzburg region&lt;ref name="ilse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="np"/&gt; and work in farms, calls itself the "Covenant Community of the New Jerusalem".&lt;ref name="mq"/&gt;&lt;ref name="ilse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pere"/&gt;

The activities of Universal Life are concentrated in Bavaria.&lt;ref name="mq"/&gt; The organisation is represented in other regions of Germany,&lt;ref name="ilse"/&gt;&lt;ref name="pere"/&gt;&lt;ref name="snafu"&gt;[http://home.snafu.de/tilman/krasel/germany/mcnair.html McNair report on religious discrimination in Germany, 1996&lt;!-- Bot generated title --&gt;]&lt;/ref&gt; as well as in Austria,&lt;ref name="UNHCR"/&gt; Italy and in Switzerland.&lt;ref name="pere"/&gt; They also do activities in other countries, as Spain.&lt;ref name="EcoDiario"&gt;[http://ecodiario.eleconomista.es/sociedad/noticias/419895/03/08/Madrid-vegetarianos-simulan-un-funeral-en-la-puerta-del-sol-por-la-muerte-de-animales-para-consumo-humano.html Madrid. vegetarianos simulan un funeral en la puerta del sol por la muerte de animales para consumo humano] 15 March 2008 EcoDiario {{es}}&lt;/ref&gt;

'''''Urubhanga''''' or '''''Urubhangam''''', ([[Devanagari]]: ऊरुभङ्गम्), ({{lang-en|'''The Breaking of the Thighs'''|italic=yes}}) is a [[Sanskrit]] play written by [[Bhasa]] in the 2nd or 3rd century CE.&lt;ref&gt;Khan A.R. "Productions - Urubhangam." Centre for Asian Theatre. 2004. CAT. 13 July 2008 &lt;http://www.catbd.org/urubhangam.html&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Based on the well-known epic, the ''[[Mahābhārata]]'', by [[Vyasa]], ''Urubhanga'' focuses on the story of the character [[Duryodhana]] during and after his fight with Bhima. Although ''Urubhanga'' contains the same core storyline as that in the ''Mahābhārata'', Bhasa’s altering of certain aspects results in a different presentation of the story.&lt;ref&gt;From G.K. Bhat's ''Two Plays of Tragic Design and Tragic Intent.'' Bombay, India. Popular Prakasha Pvt Ltd. 1974. pg.70&lt;/ref&gt; The most extreme of these alterations is Bhasa’s portrayal of Duryodhana, who, in the ''Mahābhārata'', is viewed as a villain, but in ''Urubhanga'' is given more human qualities.&lt;ref&gt;From G.K. Bhat's ''"Two Plays of Tragic Design and Tragic Intent."'' Bombay, India. Popular Prakasha Pvt Ltd. 1974. pg.72&lt;/ref&gt; While tragedy is rare among Sanskrit dramas, Bhasa’s presentation of Duryodhana’s side of the tale adds certain tragic elements to the play.&lt;ref&gt;From G.K. Bhat's ''"Two Plays of Tragic Design and Tragic Intent."'' Bombay, India. Popular Prakasha Pvt Ltd. 1974. pg.89&lt;/ref&gt;

== Synopsis ==
[[Image:Bima-kl.jpg|thumb|right| A picture of Bhima]]
''Urubhanga'' is derived from the famous epic ''[[Mahabarata|Mahabharata]]''. Although portrayed as a villain in the original play, the protagonist [[Duryodhana]] is presented in a different light in ''Urubhanga''. He isn't exempted from his original evil deeds, but he is shown as a character with heroic qualities.&lt;ref&gt;From G.K. Bhat's ''"Two Plays of Tragic Design and Tragic Intent."'' Bombay, India. Popular Prakasha Pvt Ltd. 1974. pg.69&lt;/ref&gt; The play centers around events that happen preceding his death; Duryodhana is shown repenting his past, reconciling with his family, and realizing the futility of war. 

In the beginning of the play there are three soldiers that are marveling at the battlefield between the [[Kauravas]] and [[Pandavas]]. They describe the scene before them in gory detail, each taking turn to muse and exclaim over the various details that they observe. As they progress through the battlefield, they arrive to the battle between the middle Pandava [[Bhima]] and the Kaurava Duryodhana

[[Image:Duryodana-kl.jpg|thumb|right| A picture of Duryodhana]]

The soldiers then proceed to describe the fight between Bhima and Duryodhana. The audience is seeing the battle entirely through the description of the three soldiers; ultimately, Bhima falls from Duryodhana's incessant blows. Duryodhana, refusing to kill Bhima while he is on the ground, instead has his thighs crushed by Bhima from false play and violation of rules. 

After Duryodhana has fallen, Bhima is carried away hurriedly by the other Pandavas, and Duryodhana is left on the battleground. This act of false play incites the anger of [[Balarama|Baladeva]], who wants to seek justice. However, Duryodhana stops him, having become resigned; this begins the part of the play that starts to emphasize the heroic qualities&lt;ref&gt;From G.K. Bhat's ''"Two Plays of Tragic Design and Tragic Intent."'' Bombay, India. Popular Prakasha Pvt Ltd. 1974. pg.74&lt;/ref&gt; of Duryodhana.

Duryodhana blames [[Krishna]] and forgives Bhima, as the play progresses, he is reconciled with his blind parents, then his queens (Malavi and [[Pauravi]]), and his son. Duryodhana is distressed about his situation, as he can no longer salute his father, nor can he let his son sit on his thigh. He also rejects the futility of war.&lt;ref&gt;From G.K. Bhat's ''"Two Plays of Tragic Design and Tragic Intent."'' Bombay, India. Popular Prakasha Pvt Ltd. 1974. pg.77&lt;/ref&gt;

At the end of the play, [[Ashvatthaman]], the preceptor's son, appears with the intent to seek revenge for Duryodhana and kill the Pandavas during the night, and Ashvatthaman names Durjaya, Duryodhana's son, as king of the kingdom right before Duryodhana dies. However, it needs to be noted that the play does not end completely in a tragic note,&lt;ref&gt;From G.K. Bhat's ''"Two Plays of Tragic Design and Tragic Intent."'' Bombay, India. Popular Prakasha Pvt Ltd. 1974. pg.68&lt;/ref&gt; as there are signs of hope for the future, since it is unorthodox for Indian [[Sanskrit]] dramas to end only on a sad note.

== Adaptations ==
''Urubhangam'' was presented by the Bangladesh Centre for Asian Theatre, adapted by Niranjan Adhikari and directed by Kamaluddin Nilu. The premier of the play was held at Theatre Festival [[Varmland]], Sweden in 2001. The performance is characterized by elements of [[Bengali theatre|Bengali]] folk theatre forms, rites, chorus, dance and modern techniques which goes beyond traditional forms of Sanskrit drama. The Centre for Asian Theatre performed at the Huashan Arts District Outdoor Tent Theatre hosted by the Department of Cultural Affairs of Taipei City Government. 

The ''Urubhanga'' was also adapted by [[Kavalam Narayana Panikkar]]. This version was remodified in the [[theyyam]] style. Panikkar created two Duryodhanas in the play in which one is the mortal [[Duryodhana]] and the other is [[Suyodhana]]. [[Ratan Thiyam]]'s production of the play uses  Manipuri dance and theatre traditions, as well as traditional martial art, [[Thang-Ta]].

Play is also adapted in Dogri by Kumar. A. 'Bharti', Designed by Abhishek Bharti and Directed by Aaditya Bharti which was declared as Best Production of 2017 by J&amp;K State Cultural Academy.

Journal of the American Oriental Society 105 (1985): 405-12.''&lt;/ref&gt; In this article, Gerow examines the differences between the Urubhanga and the Mahabharata ‘original’. In the Urubhanga, the villain is portrayed as the moral hero since it is Duryodhana who acts as the guide and teacher for the reader. The play draws attention to discipline over self, compassion for the enemy, reconciliation within the family. Gerow also indicates the differences between the Urubhanga and Sanskrit dramaturgy as well as the structure. 

G.K. Bhat in his book ''Tragedy and Sanskrit Drama''&lt;ref&gt;From G.K. Bhat's ''"Two Plays of Tragic Design and Tragic Intent."'' Bombay, India. Popular Prakasha Pvt Ltd. 1974. pg 68-79&lt;/ref&gt; studies the tragic design and intent established in the play.  According to Bhat, Bhasa is the single Sanskrit dramatist to experiment with ancient material to produce tragic structure. Introducing tragic motive into the play was limited and attempt at delineating the character or action was considered a denial of the existing legend and the fabrication of a new one. Therefore, Bhat is a solitary case of a daring experiment in Sanskrit dramatic literature as he breaks away from the traditional epic framework. 

In Bhasa's ''Urubhanga'' the incident and featured characters are taken from the epic but Bhasa re-orients the incident and presents it with a new motivation. In Bhasa's version, the breaking of the thighs is over before the main scene of the play opens. Also, Bhasa portrays Duryodhana as a tragic hero with heroic courage and calm determination with which he accepts his inevitable end. Eventually, Duryodhana dies like a hero. Since the [[Mahabharata]] is deeply rooted in the Indian tradition those with traditionally fixed attitudes find it difficult to accept Bhasa's rendition of the ''Urubhanga''.
